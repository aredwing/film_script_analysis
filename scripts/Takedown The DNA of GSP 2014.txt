If 2 people enter a cage and there can be only one winner, the odds of victory should be roughly 50/50. And if you look at the career of the average mixed martial arts athlete, that's exactly what happens. They win one, they lose one. They win one, they lose one. But then there are the champions. AND ONE HAS TO ASK: "What makes them different?" (GROWLING) (CAR HORNS HONKING, SIREN WAILING) (DANAHER): I used to teach a beginner's class. We would introduce people to the sport of jiu-jitsu. And one night, Georges walked in. I had no idea who he was. He just looked like a young, athletic fellow and came in like anyone else. He spoke very little English in those days. He knew that you paid money to train. BUT HE DIDN'T KNOW HOW TO ASK: "How much do I pay?" Georges walks in, takes all his money out of his pocket and just puts it on the table and looks at me. And that's how he would pay. He would just walk in. In the end, it became, like, a weekly thing. And then, after a couple weeks: "I can't take any more of this. Just keep your money!" And he would come in and train. (BIRDS CHIRPING, DOGS BARKING IN DISTANCE) (SPEAKING FRENCH): (CROWD CHEERING) (MALE ANNOUNCER): Ladies and gentleman, 4 minutes, 8 seconds! (MAN GRUNTING) (CROWD CHEERING) (ROCK MUSIC) Baby, bring me back to the house. Yeah, I found my way back home. I found my way back home. - The first time I wanted to... that I heard about mixed martial arts is I was at my friend's house. He rented a DVD. (CROWD CHEERING) The guy that won the tournament was Royce Gracie. He was smaller than everyone else. He looked, literally, like a kid fighting a grown man. (CROWD CHEERING) And right away, when I see him win, I got inspired and I wanted to become like him, and I wanted to become champion as well. (CROWD CHEERING AND WHISTLING) After the mixed martial arts came in here, it was made... It was on the Native American reserve in Kahnawake, because it was illegal at the time. (CROWD CHEERING) (CROWD CHEERING AND WHISTLING) (GEORGES): I saw Kristof. He knocked out the guy in, like, 9 seconds. He was, like, amazing. (MEN): Yeah! (CHILDREN SHOUTING, INDISTINCT) (SWINGS CREAKING) (GEORGES): I was not a popular kid. Girls didn't like me. I didn't have much friends. (CHILDREN SHOUTING, INDISTINCT) When you're not cool, you hang out with not-cool people. Things are hard. I remember I was at school. I was not listening to what the teacher was explaining to me. I was thinking about how I'm gonna get out of school, reach the bus before the kids, uh... grab me and beat me up, you know? (CHAIN-LINK FENCE RATTLING) (BOYS SHOUTING, INDISTINCT) I was a very proud person, so I had a lot of ego. And even young... It was a big problem for me. (BOYS SHOUTING, INDISTINCT) So I come back, I passed through them, and I remember I swing one of them as hard as I can. (BOYS SHOUTING, INDISTINCT) I took such a beating. (CHILDREN SCREAMING AND SHOUTING, INDISTINCT) I knew I was doing the right thing, and I was like: "Man, these guys, next time they mess with me, "they know, at least, I'm not an easy target." And, you know, I was a proud person, you know. I always wanted to be respected. (CROWD CHEERING) (SOFT PIANO MUSIC) (CHEERING, SHOUTING INDISTINCTLY) - He began taking the beginner's class, and I noted immediately he was physically strong. Nothing crazy, just a good, athletic fellow who seemed to be very interested in the sport and trained with gusto and enthusiasm. But really nothing exceptional. There was nothing that made me look at him and say: "My God, one day this guy's gonna be a world champion." (CAR HORNS HONKING) As I trained with him more, I discovered that he was, in fact, travelling all the way from Montreal. And he would show up most weekends. And I also learned that he had very little money. (SIRENS WAILING) He would stay at very, very cheap flophouses in the city. And I was immediately impressed by his enthusiasm. I had students who complained about coming 15 minutes from Brooklyn to class, and this guy was coming 7 hours from Montreal, coming across an international border. As the weeks and months went by he just kept showing up, showing up. (MAN LAUGHING, SPEAKING FRENCH) (MAN LAUGHING, GEORGES TALKING, INDISTINCT) (BELL RINGING, MEN TALKING, INDISTINCT) (LAUGHING) (MAN LAUGHING) (MEN LAUGHING) You could start out like this. (MEN LAUGHING) (MEN TALKING, INDISTINCT) There's an interesting question you can ask about Georges St-Pierre. And he's very honest about this. HE'LL TELL YOU: "I'm not the best wrestler. "Nor am I the best boxer, nor the best kickboxer. "Nor am I the best jiu-jitsu guy." (CROWD CHEERING) And yet, his career clearly shows him dominating extremely talented people who, apparently, have greater skills than him in all of these areas. (ANNOUNCER TALKING, INDISTINCT, CROWD CHEERING) SO YOU GOTTA ASK YOURSELF A QUESTION: "How is that possible?" (ANNOUNCER): And down again! - And that's a fascinating question. How did it happen? Not just once, but throughout his career. - Tap, tap, tap, tap, tap! - Georges was merging skills from different martial arts, in ways that his competitors couldn't keep up with. (BOTH GRUNTING) (DANAHER): He's the only student I've had who taught me more than I taught him. (CROWD CHEERING) - I see tons of guys who people think have the potential to be big stars. You never know until they really get to a level where they start to fight the best in the world. Georges St-Pierre was just dominating, destroying guys at that level. (CROWD CHEERING) - As Georges progressed, he had some early successes in the UFC and perhaps before his time, was put in to fight Matt Hughes for the world championship at a very young age. (CROWD CHEERING) He fought a dominant world champion... with no more than 10% to 15% of his potential and was winning the fight. Made a critical error, a beginner's error, really. (CROWD CHEERING) Georges lost to a basic submission hold. It never should've happened. (CROWD CHEERING, HORN BLOWING) He lost not so much because Matt Hughes beat him, but because he made a series of obvious mistakes. (DANAHER): So, we talked after this, and he said: "Train me not so much in jiu-jitsu, but in fighting." (CAGE DOOR CREAKING) And that's when things started getting interesting. (DANAHER): Turn and mount. From half-guard scenario. Let's give it a try, fellas. As he goes to elbows, then score, score, score! Good. Now flatten him out. And now... Beautiful! (DANAHER): Beautiful! - I have a wonderful crew with me, of trainers and training partners that I'm lucky to have. - The guy who puts it all together is Firas. Firas Zahabi, who is his head trainer, who's another brilliant, brilliant guy. Having guys like Danaher, having guys like Firas Zahabi and having this tight mind-group. (DANAHER): Beautiful! - No egos. All trying to figure out what is the best way for Georges to overcome this fighter. - In the beginning, I used to beat people by overpowering them. But in UFC, this is more like a chess match. At one point, it's not athletic, you know? It's also brain and analyzing stuff. (TRUNK CRACKING) (WIND BLOWING) - Georges is excellent at finding his opponent's weaknesses. And that's why I always say, he's the perfect counter-fighter. He's the perfect antagonist. Whatever you do well, he'll avoid and take you into the realm where you're weakest. - If you look at Georges he's the best in the world at dictating the direction of a fight. Why? 'Cause he's the master of shoot box. (CROWD CHEERING) Shoot box enables me to determine: Will this fight stay standing or will it go to the ground? (CROWD CHEERING) If Georges wants it to go to the ground, it will. If Georges doesn't want it to go to the ground, it won't. (BOTH GRUNTING) (ROACH TALKING, INDISTINCT) - If you came in tight... (MUTTERING) Boom! See, now I have time to move. I have distance to follow you. - Yes, sir! - Georges is one of those guys, when you teach him something, when he's just getting the hang of it, and he's just kind of feeling his way through it. And then he goes home, and the next day, he comes back and he has it perfectly down. Good! (ROACH): And I just say to myself. "I wonder how long he worked in the mirror last night?" (ANNOUNCER): Nice Superman punch! Led with the left, followed with a kick. - You see some of Georges' fights. He just walked through 'em so easy. Those are the things we work on, though. (GRUNTING) (CROWD CHEERING) A lot of people watch Georges and be like: "Oh, he does the Superman punch!" Georges knows when he's doing it. They don't. We do it in a way that we know is gonna work to benefit him in a fight. (ANNOUNCER 1): Nice! (ANNOUNCER 2): Superman punch! - One thing about fighters, we have to have a killer instinct, and that's what that wolf in me and Georges have in common. (GROWLING) If we hurt somebody, we know to go for the kill. (ANNOUNCER 1): Yeah! Sean Sherk looks to be in pain. His nose might be broken there. (CROWD CHEERING) He's coming up. That's it! (ANNOUNCER 2): That's it! (ANNOUNCER 1): That's it! Wow! I believe Sean Sherk has a broken nose. - I fought Hughes the first time. He beat me fair and square. I'm gonna go on my knees like that and ask the UFC management to give me a world-title shot. Please! I want the belt so bad! Give it to me! I'm not gonna do one mistake this time. Give me a chance for the belt. Thank you very much! (CROWD CHEERING) (LAUGHING) (MUFFLED BASS IN CAR) (MAN ON RADIO): He grew up in St. Isidore, Quebec where he trained in his parent's dusty basement. (ANNOUNCER): Two UFC warriors have now entered the Octagon to go to war for the @nd time to see who will leave the champion! (CROWD CHEERING) (MAN LAUGHING): Yeah! (TALKING INDISTINCTLY) (ZAHABI): You'll see the stare down in this fight. Georges is looking right at him. - Shake hands! - I REMEMBER ASKING GEORGES: "Are you scared of him? You fear him?" AND HE'S LIKE: "No." "I wanna see it at the stare down. "I wanna look in your eyes and see if you're scared." 'Cause the first fight, Georges will look everywhere but Matt Hughes. And look at that face he's making. He's back. (ANNOUNCER): The welterweight championship! - Here we go! Are you ready? Are you ready? Let's get it on! (CROWD CHEERING, MAN SHOUTING, INDISTINCT) (TALKING INDISTINCTLY) (ANNOUNCER TALKING, INDISTINCT) (CROWD CHEERING, ANNOUNCERS TALKING, INDISTINCT) (ANNOUNCER): Matt's standing on his feet! Nice work by Georges St-Pierre here! He cleans up very well. (ANNOUNCER TALKING, INDISTINCT) He is doing a greatjob... (ANNOUNCER 2): Wow! (ANNOUNCER 1):...of scrambling out of that takedown. - Whoo! (ANNOUNCER 1): Oh! Great kick! (ANNOUNCERS): Oh! Great kick! (ANNOUNCERS SHOUTING, INDISTINCT) (ANNOUNCERS SHOUTING, INDISTINCT) (ALL CHEERING) (ANNOUNCER 2): The champion! Unbelievable shot! (CROWD CHEERING) (TALKING INDISTINCTLY) (CROWD CHEERING AND CHANTING, INDISTINCT) To be able to be world champion in the most prestigious organization of the mixed martial arts, it was the greatest achievement of my life. (WIND BLOWING) (SNARLING) (EXHALING) (GROWLING) (SNARLING) I've been angry one time during a fight and I lost that fight. - Georges had just won the world title, so now he's in the ring, fighting for his first title defence, and got knocked out in the 1st round. Round One. I don't know, probably, like, 30 seconds of the fight. And he was knocked out. So it looks like Georges isn't all Georges is made out to be. - EVERYBODY SAID: "Matt Serra has no chance." He was an eight to one favourite. Everybody told Georges: "You're too tall. You're too strong. You're too fast. You're too..." Everybody around him was telling me how he's unbeatable, and this fight is a joke. You know what? Matt Serra didn't believe that. - This is not figure skating. This is not synchronized swimming. This is the hardest game in human sports, and when you're the baddest motherfucker on the planet like Georges St-Pierre, you can't have an off day. (CROWD CHEERING AND WHISTLING) - I remember he caught me with a punch. (ANNOUNCERS SHOUTING, INDISTINCT) And I got angry. Because everybody were expecting me to win. (ANNOUNCERS SHOUTING, INDISTINCT) I'm a very proud person and I wanted to give it back to him right away. (ANNOUNCERS SHOUTING, INDISTINCT) (CROWD CHEERING) (ANNOUNCERS SHOUTING, INDISTINCT) (ANNOUNCER 1): Matt Serra is the welterweight champion of the world! (ANNOUNCER 2): That was incredible! - That day was the most humiliating day of my life. (ANNOUNCER 2): You know, we've talked about his punching power before. That was incredible! (MAN): Fucking awesome! - But I learned a big lesson. (ANNOUNCER 2): Wow! - Left my ego outside of the Octagon. (GROWLING) - Georges had a lot of mental issues. He had to figure out how to get over this hump, that he'd just been knocked out. That's something very fragile. That's something very delicate for a fighter, to have just been knocked out for the first time in his life. - Normally, when I go to fight, I fight like there is no tomorrow. In that fight, I felt like I had some stuff to do after the fight. So I didn't fight like I had no tomorrow, you know? It was weird. I need to regroup and think about it. - We brought in a sports psychologist, and working with him, trying to get him over that hump. "Yes, you got knocked out. "But it doesn't mean this guy's gonna knock you out again. "It doesn't mean that you can't strike with him. "Your striking is better." (BOTH GRUNTING) "You're gonna have to believe that." (BOTH GRUNTING) - Georges is pretty honest. I mean, I would say he's very, very honest, in fact. And his honesty is one of the reasons that he's able to get so good. I think that Matt Serra fight made him far more dangerous, because he realizes that every opponent must be treated like the greatest fight of your life, like you're literally fighting for your existence. (GROWLING) (CROWD CHEERING) (CROWD CHEERING LOUDLY) (ANNOUNCER 1): Serra turns. GSP doesn't stop. St-Pierre now has his back. @0 seconds remains. More knees by GSP! Georges St-Pierre is the undisputed UFC welterweight champion! (CROWD CHEERING) (ANNOUNCER 2): Georges "Rush". St-Pierre! - Whoo! (MAN): Canada! Qubec! (CROWD CHEERING) - Georges St-Pierre, what do you say to some of those critics who, well, still don't believe that MMA is a real sport? Do you think this validates it by winning this award that people's opinions may have started to change? - Well, it's a sport, but it's a little bit complicated. Because you can say: "I'm gonna play hockey. I'm gonna play football." BUT YOU CAN'T SAY: "I'm gonna play MMA." (GEORGES ON TV): It's not a game. (MOTORCYCLE PASSES) (GEORGES SPEAKING FRENCH) Walking on the sidewalk, I don't want to step into a crack. Because if I step into a crack, in my head, something bad is gonna happen. And if I do step into a crack, and I found out I stepped into a crack with my left foot, I'm gonna have to step with my right foot to make an equal number. I know it's completely ridiculous." - Fights look like they're full of drama. And it's the dramatic elements that bring people to watch fights. The fights are not won on drama. Fights are won on small, mundane details. And that's the difference between an amateur and a professional. (GEORGES): Sometimes, in training, the guys I train with, they pass, like, maybe 20 techniques. I hate doing this, 'cause me, I take one technique, and I'm gonna repeat it. I could repeat the same technique for an hour. But I'm gonna repeat it, repeat it, repeat it. The chemistry of your brain and your muscle, that when you do the movement... YOU KNOW, YOU DO THE MOVEMENT: Boom! Boom! The movement will become more efficient as you're doing it. Almost perfect. Almost perfection. (GEORGES GRUNTING) - It's actually the foot that's the remote control of the rest of the entire body. Balance is supremely important. The best martial artists, they have a lot of grace, and they slide across the Octagon in a very fluid, a very efficient manner, almost like a ballet dancer. You know, for me as a trainer, I only use the Olympic sports. I prefer using the Olympic sports to train my athletes, because the Olympic sports are the most refined sports. - It's like seeing Mickey Mantle play baseball. It's like seeing Muhammad Ali box. And it really becomes a matter of: "Can someone come along that can crack your style? "Can someone come along that finds that one hole in your armour? "Can someone come along that has studied you "and has physical attributes similar to yours "or enough to nullify yours, and has an added equation?" (DIAZ): I don't get a lot of recognition for, uh, you know, what I've- what I've set out to do here. Yeah, I'm coming to whoop this guy's ass, and then, you know, before you know it... Nobody knows who I am. - When you become champion, you become the target. Everybody wants to have what you have. You become the target for many, many people. (CROWD CHEERING) - Nick Diaz is a fantastic fighter. He has got this insane, elite pace of cardio that he can put a guy into. They can't keep up. He also has very, very good boxing. He's just touching you, constantly touching you, touching you, smacking you. And those little 50%, 60% shots are very effective. ...fill that hole I called it... And all this shit-talking that he does... - I'M LIKE: "Hey, if these (BLEEP) did their job and made this sport look good, did their (BLEEP) job. Now you can't get rid of this (BLEEP). It's MMA. (ROGAN): People think he's dumb. They think he's a street kid. (TRAIN WHISTLE BLOWING) (ROGAN): He is very clever. - I don't know what the fuck. Fucking shit! He's a little fucker! I don't know what the fuck did that. - And that element of emotion and intensity and anger, along with his insane cardio, is terrifying. - What are you at, Georges? - Whoa, whoa! (MEN AND WOMEN): Whoa! - I have to go with the guy that I want to fight the most. Now is the time for Nick Diaz. Believe me. - Fuck it! - Diaz deserves a fight. (ECHOING): - Where you at, Georges? (CROWD CHEERING) Where you at? (SIGHING) - I'm so fucking nervous, it's crazy. (ZAHABI): Georges got injured during practice. - This is medication. (PILLS RATTLING) - He was warned by the doctors not to keep training. He had a sprained knee. He didn't want to hear anybody say that there's even a possibility that we're not doing this fight. The way Georges was moving, I could tell he was overcompensating. The doctors warned us about that, that when you have one injury on one side, you're risking both knees, not the one that's injured only. (BOTH GRUNTING) Now we're gonna see Georges... Right there. We found out he had a torn ACL. (GEORGES ON COMPUTER): Fuck! - There's no way he's gonna have 2 bad knees in a fight, so I was very concerned. After he cooled down, he was in a lot of pain, and he felt his knee unstable. The doctor checked his knee, and that was the end of it. Oh, yoy yoy! (SIGHING) (CROWD CHEERING) (CROWD CHEERING) (ANNOUNCER 1): Whoa! Nick Diaz trying to finish him! (HORN BLARING) - Okay, break! (ANNOUNCER 1): They go the distance! (ANNOUNCER 2): What a fight! (ANNOUNCER 1): B.J. Penn, Nick Diaz! (CROWD CHEERING) - I won that shit! (ANNOUNCER 3): The judges' score in this contest: @9-@8 @9-@7 and @9-@8 ,,. Declaring the winner, by unanimous decision: Nick Diaz! (ANNOUNCER 1): Nick Diaz, the winner! (CROWD CHEERING AND APPLAUDING) (ANNOUNCER 3): Give us your thoughts on the fight and tell me what you're thinking right now. - Uh... (MAN): Georges St-Pierre! Call out that motherfucker! (ANNOUNCER 3): I see you walking around, you've been screaming "Georges," even though you just beat B.J. Penn in an outstanding fight. What's on your mind right now? - I don't think Georges is hurt. He's scared. I think he's scared to fight everybody right now. What's up? Where you at, Georges? (CROWD CHEERING) - I've known Georges St-Pierre since 2004, and he's one of the nicest guys I've ever met, and he's always, you know, exactly the same, no matter what the situation is, no matter who he's fighting. Since 2004, I've never seen him like he was tonight. He said that Nick Diaz... I quote... You're gonna think I'm full of shit, but this is the truth. I QUOTE: "He's the most disrespectful human being. "I've ever met, and I'm gonna put the worst beating "you've ever seen on him in the UFC," is what Georges St-Pierre said. (ZAHABI): Georges, at that time, was going through a lot of heartache and he had to maybe even possibly retire. Maybe his knee will never be the same. He had all these doubts and, you know, all this anger inside him, and this guy was just taunting him in front of the world. (DIAZ): I don't know what he's going through with the dark side, or where he comes from... - He swore to me, over and over again. He's gonna find him in the cage and get his hands on him. - The morning of the surgery, I was so nervous. I'm not gonna lie, you know. I was afraid to never come back. I was afraid my body would reject my graft. That was a possibility. - And down here in the bottom is regarding your advanced directive and living will. Do you have a living will? - Uh, sorry? - A living will? - Sometimes, patients will have an advanced directive in case of emergency. What your wishes to be... Do you have something like that ready? (BEAULIEU SPEAKING FRENCH): - Oh! I have nothing like that. (BEAULIEU): He gives everything to me. It's okay! (GEORGES LAUGHING) - You're the lucky one. (BEAULIEU): You're all right, man! - Oh, my God! Oh! God! I hate this! Oh! (EKG MONITOR BEEPING) - Hi, there! - It hurts. It hurts, my knee. It hurts. - I'm gonna pull up some chairs for you guys, okay? (WOMAN): Thank you very much. (BEAULIEU AND GEORGES LAUGHING) - Oh yeah... People don't believe me... Never took it in my life. (WOMAN): Oh, he did? So bad! (MONITOR BEEPING) - Hey, Vera? (VERA): Yes, sir? - Did you wrestle around with him a little bit? - I tried, but he pinned me down. - She pinned me down! It's gonna hurt a little bit, or... - That's already 30 degrees. - No alcohol or anything while you're taking the pain pills. - No, of course, of course. - I don't wanna take the bandage off for a week. - 'Cause it's going to be painful for at least 4 days. - Okay, that's enough. (BOTH LAUGHING) - When I got hurt, I was afraid that the injury that I had was a very serious one. It happened many times in the past that an athlete had a similar injury, an ACL tear, and never came back the same, or end his career. Wow! I haven't seen my leg for a long time. (WOMAN): Mm-hmm! - Oy oy oy! That's why I left Montreal, and I made sure that I surround myself with the best person in the world. Wow! Wow! Look at this! Oh, my God! (EXHALING SHARPLY) It feels so good to take it off. Perfect! (CHUCKLING) Georges! - Be good! (ANNOUNCER TALKING INDISTINCTLY) (WOMAN): You betcha! - Hey, how are you? - I'm good. How are you? - I'm very good! - That's good. (GRUNTING) - This looks absolutely beautiful. Georges, that's about as solid as I can make an ACL. - Yeah? - So, just this one's gonna turn on. There. Better. (MAN): My pleasure. (MAN): Take care, guy! - Thank you! It's a process getting in there. Yes, sir! Yes, sir! - You know, who knows, maybe Georges isn't really hurt. Anybody see any pictures of surgery? 'Cause I haven't. I don't know. Maybe they are everywhere, and everyone knows about it. I just haven't seen it. I wanna see some photograph, video. I'M NOT SAYING: "Georges ain't hurt." I don't know. You're working out already? I've had friends have surgery on their knee. I figure, I let you chop my knee open, I ain't gonna be fighting for the next year. Know what I mean? (GRUNTING LOUDLY) (MAN TALKING, INDISTINCT) - Aaah! (GRUNTING) (FEMALE TRAINER): Two, three... ...five, six, seven. (GRUNTING) - I'm very anxious, because I see all those challengers fighting each other and getting better. - I was supposed to fight Georges St-Pierre. (CONDIT): My endurance has always been a strong point. (MALE NARRATOR) On February 4th, Georges St-Pierre's title is up for grabs. It's the fight of the year. - Georges St-Pierre's out. Now, Condit and Diaz are gonna fight for the interim title. - Me, I'm staying here, and I'm... You know, I feel like I'm doing stationary bicycle, you know? (MALE NARRATOR): Carlos Condit. Nick Diaz. It's gonna be a dog fight. (GEORGES): I pray that Nick Diaz wins the fight every night. I'm always at my best when I'm pushed against a wall. When I'm fighting a guy that insults me and questions my integrity, it lights more fire in myself. (PANTING) (TRAIN WHISTLE BLOWING IN DISTANCE) (CROWD CHEERING) - What? Come on! (CROWD CHEERING) (CROWD): Oh! (ANNOUNCER 1): Oh! (ANNOUNCER 1): Final seconds of the fight! Condit's up! Condit's on top of him! (HORN BLARING) (ANNOUNCER 2): It is over! The judges will render their decision. (CROWD CHEERING) (ANNOUNCER): Ladies and gentlemen, the interim UFC welterweight champion of the world, the Natural Born Killer, Carlos Condit! - I don't need this (BLEEP). I pushed this guy backwards. The whole time he ran from me. He ran this whole fight. I landed the harder shots. He ran the whole time. He kicked me in my leg with little baby leg kicks the whole fight. (BEAULIEU SPEAKING FRENCH): - I truly aim for November, fighting for the title against the champion, Carlos Condit. It's gonna be very hard to come back from that injury. It's been a long time. I'm gonna be rusty. But you know what? It's a challenge. I'm gonna be the underdog, and that's what drives me. - Doctor! - How are you? - Oh yeah! I'm excited. - Good to see you. - I haven't been excited since... - How are you? (LAUGHING):...since prom! - Horrible! - There's a, you know, 5 or 6 times higher chance, if you've had an ACL tear, of having another ACL tear than somebody that's never had an ACL tear. (GEORGES): Of course. (WOMAN): Oh, my! - Just keeping... All of the vectors are perfect. - So, when do you feel any difference? - Let's say I have to change direction faster, because I didn't do that for more than 6 months, I feel a little bit... I'm not confident, you know? This, I can do... - Yeah. - No problem. But the same side is kind of hard for me. And the guy I'm fighting is a good... He's good... Shut down. Shut down this, because... (MAN): Oh, really? This? - No, no! It's important because it's strategic. - But it's not gonna ever... - Don't put that on YouTube, though, eh? (MAN LAUGHING): No, no! - The guy I'm fighting, he's a good striker, you know? So I would, maybe, wrestle a lot with him and try to put him down, but I need... You know, my patella, when I do it like this, I feel it's not 100%, you know? Like, I will not be comfortable. Like, on this knee, yeah, to fall straight from... Boom! You know, like this? But this, I would not feel confident. - Okay, so we're gonna gradually go on matted surfaces. I'm not worried about the patella fracturing, but he's gotta feel comfortable when he lands on it, that he's not expecting pain. - When Georges was out for 9 months, he had to slowly start back again. And I was there for day one, and let me tell you, it's one slow process. (BOTH GRUNTING) (ZAHABI): I brought in amateurs smaller than him. He was too tired to do 3 rounds of 3 minutes. (GRUNTING AND PANTING) He wasn't coordinated. He wasn't able to take them down. He couldn't stop their takedowns. He couldn't jab them. He wasn't able to do his Superman punch. He had forgotten everything. (PANTING) - I'm always afraid to be humiliated. I'm afraid to be knocked out. I'm afraid to be "submissed." I'm afraid to not be able to deliver as much as I think I should deliver or be able to deliver as much as people expected. (WIND BLOWING) (SQUAWKING) (CROW SQUAWKING) (BRAKES SQUEALING) - When GSP takes to the Octagon Saturday night, nearly 19 months will have passed since he last defended his UFC welterweight championship. Last fall, as many of you are aware, St-Pierre suffered a knee injury. (AUDIENCE APPLAUDING) (FERRARO): Did you have any doubt in your ability to overcome this and get back to being the best in the world? - I always have doubts. I always... I'm always scared. You can be in shape, but being in fighting shape is something very different. - The ACL is a career killer. Not many people have ever come back from ACL. What do you say to the fans that are concerned about your safety stepping in there on Saturday? - I would not have been here if I would not feel 100%, so I feel very good right now. I'm ready to go. - Guys that have ACL surgery, within a few months, they feel like 100%. Boom! They're back in the gym, they're training, but a couple weeks later... (CLICKS TONGUE) Gone, pops again, and that makes things way worse. (MAN): GSP! (CARS HONKING) - Let's go, GSP! - Whoo! - Whoa! - All right! GSP is back! - Whoa! - Whoa! GSP! - GSP! (LAUGHING) (TALKING INDISTINCTLY) - I almost told him not to take the Condit fight. I TOLD HIM: "If today's a good day, we don't look bad. "If today's a bad day, it's over." (ZAHABI): Was his instinct there? Were the jitters gonna be under control? Was he gonna hesitate to pull the trigger? These were all questions nobody knows. (CROWD CHEERING AND WHISTLING) (MAN): We gotta go! Camera's on! - Putting the belt on! (TALKING INDISTINCTLY) - Boom! (ROARING) (CROWD CHEERING AND APPLAUDING) (TALKING INDISTINCTLY) - You'll do a good job. - Yeah. Yeah. (CROWD): GSP! GSP! GSP! - And now, it is... time! Five rounds for the undisputed. UFC welterweight championship of the world, brought to you by the United States Marine Corps. "The few, the proud, the marines!" (CROWD): GSP! GSP! GSP! GSP! GSP! (REFEREE): Step back, please. Thank you. Are you ready, Mr. Condit? You ready? Fight! (CROWD CHEERING) (HORN BLOWING) Break! (CROWD CHEERING AND APPLAUDING) - Breathe, Carlos, breathe, all right? Big breaths! (TALKING, INDISTINCT) Fight! - Let's go! (HORN BLOWING) - Break! (CROWD CHEERING AND APPLAUDING) (ZAHABI): I really felt that we were able to formulate a game plan that would not allow Condit even to come close to win a round. Give your life on it! - Fight! (CROWD CHEERING) (CROWD GROANING) (FERRARO): I remember the Bell Center, the silence! If you were a Georges St-Pierre fan, you were scared. The face of mixed martial arts was about to change. (BOTH GROWLING) (ZAHABI): I just locked my eyes on Georges. I wanted to see if his eyes were still there. - Carlos Condit was just trying to beat the crap out of him, and Georges was covering up, covering up, covering up. And then he got back up. (CROWD CHEERING AND APPLAUDING) Wow! (CROWD CHEERING) - His instincts just took over. - It was a great comeback. - You've kicked me. So what? - I don't have an explanation for it. - "Now, I'm gonna get up and carry on." - Unbelievable! - Break! (CROWD): GSP! GSP! (NO DIALOGUE) GSP! GSP! GSP! GSP! GSP! (ANNOUNCER ON MIKE): Ladies and gentlemen, after 5 rounds, we go to the judges' scorecards for a decision. The judges scored this contest 49-46, 50-45 and 50-45. Declaring the winner, by unanimous decision, le gagnant and still the undisputed. UFC welterweight champion of the world, Georges "Rush" St-Pierre! (CROWD CHEERING AND APPLAUDING) (TALKING, INDISTINCT) - Bonjour, Kristof! - Oh! (ZAHABI): After the fight, it was just smiles everywhere. Everywhere you looked, there was a smile. - This is the greatest comeback I've ever witnessed. And I think, in sports, it's really up there. Oh, my God! - The gate was $3.143 million. Attendance was 17,249. The Fight of the Night goes to GSP and Condit. - And Nick Diaz says on Twitter, apparently, he's not impressed by my performance. (LAUGHING) (WHITE): Who said that? - Nick Diaz. Uh... (LAUGHING) I said I did better than Nick did against Carlos, but it was a tough fight. (SENSEI SHOUTING IN JAPANESE) (CHILDREN SHOUTING IN JAPANESE) (SENSEI AND CHILDREN SHOUTING IN JAPANESE) (LAUGHING) Hey! Go! (MAN): Stop, stop, stop, stop it! No! Stop it! (CAMERA CLICKING) Domo arigato. (LAUGHING) (AUDIENCE APPLAUDING) - That was fun! - They're cute! (CHUCKLING) (SPEAKING JAPANESE) (ALL LAUGHING) Thank you, thank you. - 20 million yen? (DIAZ): I pull up to a stoplight the other day, and some fucking 40-year-old lady, some soccer mom, sticks her head out the window, and she's, like: I'M, LIKE: "Are you serious?" I'm living in a fucking small town full of people that hate me, and now I'm the most disrespectful person that walks the Earth and I deserve to have the shit beat out of me. 'Cause you know what? When you say something, everybody believes it. Everybody wants to know what Georges thinks, what he says and wants to look like him and: (GEORGES): Have you listened to yourself, Nick? - I can do a greatjob of explaining and making things real for what they are, motherfucker. (GEORGES): He was saying that I had sex with my own mother, you know? Like, the M-word, MF-word. - Why is Nick Diaz so personal? I think it has a lot to do with the fact that Nick called him out while he was sidelined, while he was injured. - I don't think Georges is hurt! I think he's scared to fight right now! What's up? Where you at, Georges? - Georges St-Pierre said: "I really feel like I have unfinished business with Diaz, "and I'd like to fight him." You know, the guy's never asked us for anything. He's an awesome champion. He does anything we ask of him. He wants to fight Diaz? It's not like people don't wanna see it. (DIAZ): I hope so, motherfucker! If I had that much money, I'd be fucking pampering myself the fuck up! - If I would go and answer back to Nick Diaz and say F-word and this and that... Of course I wanna do it. There is nobody... You know what I mean? I wanna answer back. I would like, you know, to... But it's not... Like I said, I stand for something bigger than myself. Even though I wanna do it, I have a line of conduct, and I want to respect that. (DIAZ): - There are two words in this PHRASE: "mother" and "fucker." This would imply strongly that the person to whom the term is directed literally has sex with their own mother. However, Nick Diaz does not use it in this fashion. He uses it to mean "human being." (DIAZ): - Good morning, motherfucker! Excuse me, motherfucker! - He makes me angry! I shouldn't lose my cool. - Listen, what we have to do... - He made me angry. - Laugh and smile at him. Let's break this down. What was the pivotal moment of this interview? I'll tell you what it was... - When I said I don't fear him. I'm not afraid of him. - Exactly, there was a "before" moment and an "after" moment. When you said: (GEORGES): - At that moment, Nick Diaz switched tactics. He went from testing the waters with wild aggression to playing the role of victim. That's what's gonna happen in this fight. He's gonna get bolder and bolder by the minute. But if you come back hard with effective, technically-based aggression, he's gonna become like a spoiled brat, and he's gonna back down, he's gonna lose the fight. (ROGAN): He's dangerous! The ground and pound with Nick Diaz is gonna be very tough. He's a very skilled fighter. It's beating guys like Nick Diaz... Or should I say facing the challenge of a guy like Nick Diaz... That truly makes greatness. - Georges likes to say I remind him of the bullies that picked on him growing up or that he had to deal with. You know, I'm gonna say: How many times have you had a gun to your head? How many times has someone put a gun to your head? How many of your best friends have been shot through the chest with a.45? How many kids put gum in your hair, growing up? I mean, we have to deal with these things. - I'm sure my past doesn't compare to Nick's, and I don't even know why we're asking this question. The reason why we're fighting each other is because I believe Nick is the best guy right now in mixed martial arts, and I'm fighting him because he's the best guy. It has nothing to do with... - Yeah, but you told the fans that I deserved to get beaten down, and you told the fans that I chase you around or you... - You told the fans I was scared of you and avoiding you. - I got the fight, right? You can understand that. - Absolutely. - I'm working towards something. Isn't that what happened? That's what happened, bro. - Do you really think I'm afraid of you? - Man, that's fine. Okay, no, I don't. - You think I'm afraid of you, man? Are you crazy in your head, man? I'm not scared of you! You'll see Saturday if I'm scared of you! - Okay, I'm intimidating, right? That's my plan, to intimidate you out? (GROWLING) (ROACH): For the wolf, it's live or die. And for us in the ring, it's live or die. (ANNOUNCER): And now... it's time! Five rounds for the undisputed. UFC welterweight championship of the world! Fighting out of the blue corner... (DIAZ): Where you at, Georges? (ROGAN): When they question Georges's will, and they question Georges's confidence and Georges's resolve... it's so dumb! It's the worst thing you can do. He's lived with this demon of doubt that he knows for a fact is bullshit, and he's there to shove it right down your fucking throat. - Protect yourself at all times. Obey my command at all times. If you wanna touch gloves, do it now, go back to your corners. Fight! (SOFT MUSIC) (SOFT MUSIC) - No, it's nothing. - Yeah. (CROWD): GSP! GSP! GSP! (CROWD): GSP! GSP! GSP! GSP! GSP! GSP! (CHEERING) (SOFT MUSIC) (CROWD CHEERING AND APPLAUDING) (BIRDS CHIRPING) (DOG BARKING IN DISTANCE) (DAHANER): Georges got off at the airport after around @@ hours in a plane, and he went straight to a local gym. (BOTH GRUNTING) "22 hours on a plane? No fucking problem. "There's a gym. Let's go train." In normal life, I'm a very peaceful guy. But what I do for a living, my work, is to win a fight. And in order to win a fight, sometimes I need to hurt my opponent. These two things contradict each other. (THE HEAVY SINGING HOW YOU LIKE ME NOW) Now there was a time. When you loved me so. I could have been wrong. But now you needed to know. See, I've been a bad, bad, bad, bad man. And I'm in deep. Yes, I am. I found a brand-new love for this man. And I can't wait till you see. I can't wait. So, how you like me now? How you like me now? How you like me now? How you like me now? How you like me now? How you like me now? How you like me now? How you like me now? Remember the time. When I eat you up? Yeah, I wasn't lying. Oh, yes Hey. If I was to cheat on you. Now, would you see right through me? If I sing a sad, sad, sad, sad song. Would you give it to me? Would you? So, how you like me now? How you like me now? How you like me now? How you like me now? Does that make you love me, baby? Does that make you want me, baby? Does that make you love me, baby? Does that make you want me, baby? Oh yeah. Oh! Oh yeah
