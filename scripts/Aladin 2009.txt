Just a little ahead of Delhi lies Khwaish.. ..or then, Khwaish could be within your heart.. ..just like, sometimes, some stories can come true. Like l said, some stories can come true.. ..and one such story begins in house number three on this street.. ..where Professor Arun lives with his wife Riya and his son Aladin. Yes, you heard right. - Aladin. They named their son 'Aladin'.. ..because they believe that Aladin's story is true.. ..and that they can help mankind by finding Aladin's lamp. And today, Arun is going in search of that lamp. Arun. Arun. Arun, we're getting late and you're standing here. Bye, Dad. Bye, Grandpa. Aladin is too young.. you shouldn't take him to the mountain. Dad. Dad. Then what's the big deal in naming him 'Aladin'? The sooner he gets accustomed to adventures, the better. Don't worry. Arun, enough with the suspense. Will you tell me why we've come this far up? My wife, look.. Professor Nazer and my calculations say that this is here somewhere. Suppose you found this lamp.. - Okay. And a genie came out of it.. - Okay. What will you wish for first? Simple. That you, me and Aladin stay happy, stay together forever. Aladin. Where is your Genie? Aladin. Aladin. Where is your Genie? l am not the Aladin from the fairytale. l can't call a Genie. But your name is Aladin, isn't it, duffer? So, shut up and rub. Oh, dear Aladin. Your Genie did not come. Get up. You broke the lamp? Please, Kasim. Let me go. l will only let you go if the Genie comes out. Get it? Get another lamp. l don't want to rub any more lamps. Let me go. Hurry. Hurry.. hurry. Move. Catch him.. catch him. Don't let him escape. Catch Alu.. and make mincemeat out of him. Aladin. Aladin.. where is your Genie? Aladin. Aladin.. where is your Genie? Alu, stop. Stop, Alu. Wait. Aladin. Aladin. Where is your Genie? Aladin. Aladin. Where is your Genie? Aladin? Come on. Alu.. Catch him. Catch him. Nab him. Alu. Alu. Alu. Sorry, sorry. Alu. l am sorry. Sorry. All my stuff. l know where to find him. Wait. But Margina, what have l done? Did you say anything about Margina? Food? Yes. She makes horrible food. World's worst cook. Can't even boil an egg properly. You shouldn't have said that. - Why? Here's the egg you ordered. That's why. Alu. Kasim, l don't want to rub any lamp. What? Your name is Aladin and you hate lamps? Get a lamp for Alu. Just get the lamp, will you? What sort of a person are you? You eat food inside and are getting beaten up by Kasim outside. l'd rather get beaten up than eat this. So, are you done yet? lt's done. - Let me see. Perfect. Wow. - Finally. Tea in Chaipiyoji. 'T' for torture man. Don't change the topic. Why do you let Kasim bully you? Why don't you fight for yourself? Why? What's the point of fighting for myself? lt's not like l have to save the world tomorrow. What if you had to save the world? What will you do? Run away? ln life.. ln life, you have to be prepared for anything. Why? - Why? Because.. ..life is like a restaurant.. ..where everyone gets a table.. ..but not the menu.. ..and no one knows what kind of food.. ..fate will serve you, Aladin Chatterjee. Just like in Chaipiyoji. Very funny. When Kasim makes you rub lamps.. ..keep laughing like this. You're very mischievous. And finally.. ..let's talk about the comet's passing which might just be the.. ..the most amazing event of our lives. Scientists claim that it's after one million years.. ..that this comet will pass over the earth. Yes, after a million years. So, let's talk to Professor.. ..Abu Nazer from Khwaish University about this. Prof. Nazer, welcome to Daily News. Professor, is it possible that a comet can reappear.. ..after a million years? ls this possible? Well, even though it sounds impossible.. ..extensive research has been conducted in the past few days. Experiments have been conducted too. All results conclude that this comet.. ..is in fact passing over earth after a million years. Prof. Nazer, since we don't know much about this comet.. ..can it cause any kind of harm to us? Are we in any danger from this comet? l don't know about the danger.. - How can a comet be dangerous? lt is still an unexplained phenomena.. but Lingmasta. Lingmasta? 'Ringmaster.' And Ringmaster never lets anything happen to his friends. You are still my friend? Aren't you? Thank you. Oh, yes. Didn't you have to go somewhere? Oh. Jasmine.. Come, come. Friends.. l want to introduce your new classmate. As l was saying.. ..Jasmine is here from America.. ..through the student exchange programme. Jasmine. Welcome to Khwaish University. l am requesting all you clowns. - Please.. Please make a good impression on her. Yes, sir. And Jasmine.. ..don't give your phone number to anyone. Ah! Before l begin.. ..it's one of our colleague's birthday today. Friends. Let's all join in wishing.. ..Aladin a very happy birthday. - Alu. Happy birthday to you. Happy birthday to you. Happy birthday, dear Aladin. Happy birthday to you. There goes the girl who stole my heart. There goes the girl. There goes the girl who stole my heart. There goes the girl. l have lost my senses. l am going crazy, l have lost my senses. l am going crazy. What has her love done to me? There goes the girl who stole my heart. There goes the girl. - Wow. Sorry. The song demands that.. ..one has to do this while singing it. Happy birthday. - Thank you. l'm Jasmine. l know. - l am Aladin. l know. The one from the fairytale? No. No. Never. Chatterjee. Definitely not the one from the fairy tale. Aladin Chatterjee. Aladin, l am sorry about your nose. Nose? No. lt wasn't your fault. lt was that stupid pole there.. And that's the problem with poles.. ..they just.. ..they just stand anywhere. l thought you were looking at me.. and you? Me? Looking? At you? No, no. l wasn't looking at you. Where was l looking? l look a lot.. Whenever my eyes are open, l look. l keep looking. lt's a bad childhood habit. Like for example.. Look, there's Kasim. What did you say? - Look, there's Kasim. Then? Look, there's Kasim. - Then? Alu.. my brother. l am so sorry. How could l forget your birthday. - All right. Like you forgot last year. And the year before that. You joker. l am feeling so bad you know. l forgot his birthday. Listen, Alu. - We lovingly call him Alu (potato). A party. - Tonight. - For you lt's on me. No, it's okay. lt's not okay, Alu. l wouldn't be able to forgive myself. That's very sweet of you. Hi, Kasim Jasmine.. What is your plan tonight? Why don't you come to the party too? Are you sure? l mean you guys are old friends and.. ..l don't want to impose myself.. lmpose? Are you listening, Alu? lt'll be an expose. l mean it will be an honour. Please come. Okay, l'll be there. Awesome. That's the spirit. lt's party time. All right. Jasmine.. Have you seen the campus yet? Allow me. l'll give you a guided tour of the campus. This is like my second home. ln fact, l was born here. Please.. And you.. And you just kept looking? lf you were in my place, what would you have said? Look, there's Kasim. Very funny. No. Seriously.. ..look, there's Kasim. l need to buy a present for Aladin. Do you know any shop around here? Of course. l'll take you there right after college. Welcome. Happy birthday to me. Happy birthday to me. Happy birthday, dear Aladin. Happy birthday to you. l wish all of you were here. Do you know how boring it is to live alone? Watch this, Grandpa? You will be proud. l have mastered this trick now. lf you don't study.. ..how will you go on adventures, like your dad? l don't want to go to school. lf you go to school.. l'll teach you a magic trick. What trick? And now the magic mantra. Tak Dhina Din. Aladin. You know, Grandpa.. ..l don't feel like going to Kasim's party tonight. But then.. ..Jasmine will be there. Alu. Happy birthday, Alu. You have gained enough sympathy with the bleeding nose, Alu? Now, quietly take your gift and scram. ls that clear? Quick. He is coming. Happy birthday, Aladin. Happy birthday to you. Thank you. You're welcome. Open your present and see. No. l am sure it's nice. Alu, open it. Come on, open it. Open it. Open it. Do you like it? Kasim told me you really like lamps. Yes. Aladin and the lamp go way back, right? Yes. Yes. Thank you. Hey, Alu? Why don't you rub the lamp, for childhood's sake? Oh. Aladin would do that? - No. So cute. - Yes. Come on. One more time please. No. - Just once. Come on, Alu please. No. - Jasmine, you tell him. Please, Aladin. Just once. Aladin. Aladin. Where is your Genie? Aladin. l don't want anything more from you.. ..just take your gift and scram. May l? Alu.. Happy Birthday. Happy birthday, Alu. Alu, happy birthday. Thanks. Yes. Brother. Where are you off to? Come, let's do some disco. Come on. You might not believe, you might not know.. ..what l am talking about. But someday you will realise.. ..what l say is true. You might not believe, you might not know.. ..what l am talking about. But someday you will realise.. ..what l say is true. Lost. Lost. You look so lost. Come with me and change your destiny. The whole world will dance to your tunes. Tak Dhina Din. Hey, Aladin. The world has changed for a new day has come. Tak Dhina Din. Hey, Aladin. Forget your past, it's your time now. You might not believe, you might not know.. ..what l am talking about. But someday you will realise.. ..what l say is true. You might never have even dreamt or thought of such things. For what is to happen.. - You might have read about only in books. You are the answer to your own questions. Life is a disco and we are all dancers. And the world is singing and dancing with us. Tak Dhina Din. Hey, Aladin. The world has changed for a new day has come. Tak Dhina Din. Hey, Aladin. Forget your past, it's your time now. You might not believe, you might not know.. ..what l am talking about. But someday you will realise.. ..what l say is true. l have never danced, nor sung. Not even in my dreams. What is this that makes me sing, l want to know. ls there an answer to my questions? ls there a dancer inside me? There is a dancer. - Why are you hiding from the world? Tak Dhina Din. Hey, Aladin. The world has changed for a new day has come. Tak Dhina Din. Hey, Aladin. Forget your past, it's your time now. You might not believe, you might not know. ..what l am talking about. But someday you will realise.. ..what l say is true. One more time. Tak Dhina Din. Hey, Aladin. The world has changed for a new day has come. Tak Dhina Din. Hey, Aladin. Forget your past, it's your time now. Forget your yesterday. Yes, Brother. ls this the way to the party? Okay. Yes. Party time. l've been standing here for so long. Nowadays, no one invites me to parties anymore. Expecting someone? Ah! Oh, hello. Hey.. Put the cake down. Or? Or? Or? Or? Or.. Or.. Put the cake down. Delicious. My guitar. Who are you, sir? Who are you? He who can make the impossible into the possible, and possible into.. Or something like that. lt was a great saying. Anyway, brother. ln a nutshell.. What a man thinks.. ..but cannot do.. To make that happen. That's my claim to fame. And Genius is my name. l did not understand, sir. Just what l was afraid of. lt's completely empty. You have no brains. Look. lt's not right to enter someone's house.. ..and stick your hand in his brain. You were saying something? Aladin Chatterjee. Bengali? Just hear me out clearly. l guess you are unaware of the fact.. ..you are now the proud owner of a magical lamp and three wishes. Understand. Come. Come. Wait. Let me get this. Your name is Genius? l have a lamp which is where you came out of.. ..because l rubbed you? Not me, you fool. You rubbed the lamp. Now, quickly ask for your three wishes and let me go. l have no time. Hey, would you have something to eat out here? l get really hungry after dancing. But that is a fairytale, isn't it? How can this be true? How is it possible? Genie? Lamp? Three wishes. Brother. Everything is possible. Look at this. lf a donkey like you can look like a man.. ..then anything is possible. What is your wish? What do you want? Who was that donkey? Oh, Brother. You know.. ..you bore me. Look. l had been sitting idle in this lamp for the past twenty years.. ..and no one bothered. Now, when l am just two months away from retirement.. ..you came by.. Mr. Aladin Chatterjee. And you rubbed the lamp. Look, Brother - it's very simple. lf you don't redeem your three wishes now.. ..my contract shall get extended by another million years. So, please hurry up. l want to finish my contract and move out of the lamp. Move out.. Contract.. Three wishes.. l don't understand a thing. What should l wish for? You don't understand? How about a brain? You have no brains. How about a car, a house, money, ice cream. lce cream? - Yes. lce cream. Wish for anything. But make it fast. Just make a wish. But.. What should l? -Oh, God. This one will not let me retire. Yes. Aladin. Man.. Man.. The man got it going. The man got it going. Got it going. He keep the party going till the break of dawn. Got the blondes and the forties. Rolling with their choice. Giving them every little thing they want. Giving them every little thing they want. Make a wish, make a wish. And l'll make your wish come true. l'll fulfil all your wishes, all your dreams and your hopes too. Make a wish, make a wish. And l'll make your wish come true. l'll fulfil all your wishes, all your dreams and your hopes too. l will open the doors to heaven. All you got to do is say it. You will win every game.. All you got to do is, play it Aladin, give me a five. Though your brain is empty. Lady luck is coming by to change your life. Aladin, give me a five. Though your brain is empty.. Lady luck is coming by to change your life. l do the grooves and the whole world.. Come and shake a leg with me. l do the grooves and the whole world.. Don't you try to pull back. l do it like this. l do it like that. And when l'm at the decks.. ..the beat don't stop. And the bass is flat. The man got it going. Got it going on. He keeps the party going till the break of dawn. Got the blondes and the forties.. Rolling with their choice. Giving them every little thing they want. Aladin, give me a five. Though your brain is empty. Lady luck is coming by to change your life. Lady luck is coming by to change your life. Lady luck is coming by to change your life. Aladin, give me a five. Though your brain is empty.. Lady luck is coming by to change your life. Lady luck is coming by to change your life. Lady luck is coming by to change your life. l got the rocks. l got the ride. l got the hot girls by my side. l got the moves. And l got game. You can get close but it isn't the same. When l say, Hey, Mama. l get them jumping. And when l beat the drum.. Got the party pumping. Like this. Boom biddy boom, Biddy biddy boom boom. Biddy boom biddy boom boom. Aladin, give me a five. Though your brain is empty.. Lady luck is coming by to change your life. Lady luck is coming by to change your life. Lady luck is coming by to change your life. Aladin, give me a five. Though your brain is empty.. Lady luck is coming by to change your life. Lady luck is coming by to change your life. Lady luck is coming by. Lady luck is coming by. Lady luck is coming by.. ..to change your life. -Make a Wish. l finally get it. All this isn't really happening. This cannot be true. You have hypnotised me. You can't be a Genie. You are a magician from a circus. Me? - Yes. A magician from a circus? Yes. Stop talking nonsense. You dare doubt me and my powers? How dare you compare me to a circus magician? Do you know who l am? l am Genius. Genius. Goodnight, Aladin. ls that it? Shall l make the bill? Have you decided yet? Oh, no. What happened, Aladin? Nothing. All okay. l thought something scared you. He must have had the breakfast. Definitely. lt scared me too. What do you want? Not me.. What do you want? Why are you following me? Why are you whispering? Where are you going? Have your lunch. No. - l had my lunch. Yes. Aladin, let's have lunch. This dessert is really very good. Dessert? - Who.. Who are you? Who is he? Oh. Sorry. She is Margina. - And you? You.. My father's brother. My uncle. ls it? -Uncle's son. So, technically, we are cousins. A distant, very distant relative's second cousin. Right? Right. - Shall we? 'Uncle'? Do l look that old to you? At most, l'm old enough to be your elder brother. Do you know an average Genie's age? Dude. l am just a teenager. Look? How did you do that? Simple. Like this. Look. Don't? Wait. - is this your sweater? What? This? ls this your sweater? Of course, it's mine. Look. l really don't care. l don't care about your age or who you are. And l don't want anything from you. Since you are my very 'distant' Relative's second cousin.. ..why don't you keep your distance from me too? l have an audition today and it's a very important day for me. Thank you. There comes a day when youth is in bloom. When just a glance can set water on fire. When the heart will be lost.. so, let the heart lose itself.. Let whatever happen. -Who is next? Aladin Chatterjee. Alu. l was looking for you. Brother. First, you push me away, then you come looking for me. Hey, dude. You are so very confused. Look? l.. What is this? - What? Come here. Style, Brother. Style. You will never understand. - Look.. l have my audition. l need my guitar. Your first wish.. - What? Your first wish is that you want a guitar. No, that is not my wish. How is that my wish anyway? You turned my guitar into a frog.. ..now, you will have to turn it back into a guitar. Brother. From every angle that l study it, this is clearly a wish. Listen, you have an audition.. ..and you are stuck with a frog? Unfortunately, you cannot play the frog.. ..and you need a guitar and you have not one but three wishes. Hence proved. This is your first wish. Nonsense. This is so not fair. You are no Genie. You're a conman. Yes. Ok. What? Volume. Volume. Now, where did he plug that wire? Yes. Okay. Volume. Okay. Volume. Volume. No. No. This? This is my bodyguard until l find the lamp. You ask too many questions. Look. Once l find the lamp.. ..l will grab it from it's owner.. ..Then l'll kill the owner of the lamp.. ..catch hold of the comet.. ..and go back to being a Genie again. Then l will kill everyone.. ..and then rule over the whole world. Then l'll be cool. - l'll be chilled out. Sorry, darling, not alone. With you. Yes. Aladin. Aladin. Oh, dear. Hello. Off you go into his brain. So, this is her. You. You. - Here? How did you enter my thoughts? Dude. - l am a genie. l was the topper in my class. l am the best. l can do anything. This is not fair. These are my private thoughts. Please go. You really are something else. You are not supposed to see this. This is personal. Come here, boy, come. You know, you are wasting my time by thinking so much. l can do this for you. What do you mean? -l mean you have three wishes. Yes. -Let your first wish be this. Jasmine. What? You can do that? -Do that? You are embarrassing me, Sir Aladin. What do you think? That Romeo got Juliet? And Ranjha found Heer without any help? You brought those lovers together? Not really. But l can do this. Magic. No. This won't be right. To win her over by magic won't be morally correct. You, and your morals and principles. What use are these morals if they can't even land you a girl? Alu. Genius. Genius. Genius.-Did you call, sir? Please? l want Jasmine. No. This is not the right format to ask for a wish. You'll have to ask like this. How can l.. Just kidding. Say it like this. May fantasy become reality. May Jasmine fall in love with me. May fantasy become reality. No. Stop. Say it in your own style. May fantasy become reality. May Jasmine fall in love with me. Did you hear that? The acknowledgement 'boom' of your first wish. Then Let there be light. One moment. Tea, my sweetheart. My sweetheart.. ..when will we get married? Take a sip. l made it with my own pretty little hands. When will we have children? Darling, are you okay? Do you want a head massage?-No. Or how about a Thai foot massage? No. Please sit.. madam. Please sit. But Thai foot massage? Thai foot massage. l mean l don't want a Thai foot massage. l want.. l want a minute. Okay. Thank you. Let me think for a bit. l feel shy, darling. l feel shy, darling. How do l tell you, what's in my heart? Why are you shy? Why are you scared? Just tell him. Oh, darling. Take me home. Take me home. Oh, darling. Take me home. Take me home. Oh, darling. Take me home. Take me home. He is running away. Look, your darling is running away. Your darling is running away. Tell him what's in your heart quickly. Why are you shy? Why are you scared? Just tell him. Oh, darling. Take me home. Take me home. There are dreams in these deep eyes. Will you make me your dream? Will you let me in your heart? l will not be tricked by these deep eyes. Stay away from me. Don't call me darling. lf you really love him, then why are you shy? Look into his eyes. Don't sigh.. Just tell him Oh, darling. Take me home. Take me home. Oh, darling. Take me home. Take me home. Oh, darling. Take me home. Take me home. Hi sir. - Good morning. Oh, darling. Don't go away. Where did you suddenly land from, full of love? Don't you follow me. Bless me by holding me close. Take me home. Take me home. Take me home. Take me home. Take me home. No, never. No, never. Where are you going? Why don't you come close? l will show you a magic trick and make our hearts meet.Kiddo.. Oh, darling. Take me home. Take me home. Oh, darling. Take me home. Take me home. - Genius. Oh, darling. Take me home. - Genius. Take me home.Oh, darling. Oh, darling. Genius. - What? Whatever this is, it is not love. Please stop all this. Just let everything go back to what it was. Take me home. - This is your second wish? Take me home. - Yes. Say it. - Oh, darling. Take me home. - Don't go away. Yes. - Okay. Oh, darling. - Hey, Aladin. The format is wrong again.. Excuse me. Oh, darling.-Let reality become a fantasy.. ..and bring back the earlier normalcy. Oh, darling.Take me home. The first wish is over. This was the acknowledgement 'boom' for wish number two.-Oh, darling. Then Let there be light.Take me home. But.. What? Don't worry. Nobody will remember anything. Example. 'Example' Brother. Example. Weak in Hindi and English. Example. Aladin. - Good afternoon, sir. Who are you? He is my cousin. Okay. l didn't know you had a cousin. Even l didn't know.. ..but here he is. - Hi. Professor Nazer. Hello. How do you do? Very well, thank you. Nice to meet you, sir. - Thank you. Got to go. Thank you. - Bye. Did you see? No one remembers a thing. Come on. - Hey, Aladin. l'm really impressed. Two wishes in less than ten minutes. Two wishes? How so? Two wishes? 'Please. Please. l want Jasmine.' First wish. 'No, no. l don't want Jasmine.' Two wishes. Now, quickly ask for your third wish. But Brother.. Let's eat something before that. l get really hungry after the dance. Yes, Come on, let's go. This is Nazer. l know where the mirror is. Good. The snitch gave a sniff of good news. We found the mirror. Move aside. Stop laughing, you clown, and make way. You make way. l'll plug you one in the nose and make it bigger and redder. Move aside. Who are you? Ringmaster. The road is as clear as the sky Let's go get the mirror. This mirror is the Google of the Genie world. lt has answer to all questions. The quality is that it can be used as an ordinary mirror too. Darling, come here quick. Be quick. See? So, the order of the genies has picked him to stop me? So, for me to live.. ..he will have to die. Only a few days remain for the comet to pass over Khwaish. Let's ask Mrs. Patel about her plans for that day. l plan to make comet shaped sandwiches for the occasion. When the comet passes over us, my family and l.. ..will be eating it. l mean those sandwiches. Would you like to go to the Students' Ball with me? Would you like to come to the Students' Ball with me? Please, please, please. Jasmine, would you like to go to the Students' Ball with me? Think. Enemy. First pattern with count. One. Two. Three. Think. Enemy. Think. Enemy. Think. Enemy.. One. Jasmine, would you like to go to the Ball with me? Be ready all the time. Make it your gospel. Would you like to go to the Ball with me? An enemy can appear at any time from anywhere. Who are you taking to the Ball, Alu? Jasmine. No. l was just.. What am l doing here? l was actually going to the library.-Alu. Demonstrate,-Let me give you some advice for free. l need a volunteer. A donkey like you.. ..can never get a girl like Jasmine. Alu.. There is only one way you can get Jasmine You. Me? Positions. Hi. Would you like to go to the Students' Ball? Attack. What? - Attack her. Attack her? Why? Who? What? - You fool. Wow. l love this girl. Aladin. Are you okay?

Wonderful. What are you waiting for? Finish the enemy. But Aladin is a friend. 'Friend.' The enemy is never a friend. - Enemy. Befriend the enemy and you're dead. Come back, you! Always finish the enemy. - But l'm Aladin. Hey, Alu. You just gave a new meaning to Students' BALL. Alu.. Like l was saying.. ..there is just one way to win Jasmine over. Go and buy all the lamps ln the world.. ..and start rubbing them. lf by chance a Genie pops out of one.. ..ask him for Jasmine. Because only magic can win over Jasmine.. ..and that magic is in me. Aladin, l am so sorry. Did l hurt you? Not at all. l'm accustomed to it by now By the way, what were you saying.. ..about the Students' Ball? Well..l was trying to say that.. You.. me.. Alu was trying to say that he cannot go to the Students' Ball with you.. ..because he's already found a date. How nice. Fantastic. You want your third wish. l will finally be free. Mind blowing, Brother. Make-a-wish. Make-a-wish. Make-a-wish. Jasmine.-Okay, Brother. What? Again? But without any magic. l want her to like me just the way l am.. ..without any magic. Oh, come on, Brother. Don't be a bore. l only work with magic. l'm a genie. Use me like a genie. Like any nice, self-respecting selfish man.. ..ask me for something big. Think big. Let me make you the world's richest man. Forget Jasmine, the whole wide world will be at your feet. Come on, Brother. Quickly. Ask me for a wallop of a dollop of a third wish.. ..so l that l can leave. Yes. Aladin. All right. l don't need your help. Because l have no one, Kasim calls me names.. Donkey, duffer, whatever he wants to. You're in a hurry to leave? All right then, tell me what l have do to set you free. Oh, man. Okay, come on. Wish. Wish for what? Wish for whatever's in your heart. Really?-Yes. Really. Not reality, not fantasy - But let me warn you.. ..you are wasting your wish. The entire ocean lies before you.. ..and you want to go dive in a bucket? You've already wasted two wishes on Jasmine. That's two wishes. You don't need my help to woo Jasmine. You can do that on your own. l can't. l don't need fantasies to come true through magic's art.. ..all l need is your help in winning Jasmine's heart. There goes the third wish. That was the last acknowledgement 'boom'. So, Let there be light. So.. Mr. Genius..What's the plan? The plan was to retire.. ..but now, it's to woo Jasmine. Cool. But without any magic. Yes. Yes. Thank you. Yes. Brother. How are you doing? Who's the old man? Some Aladin's cousin. Sir Romeo. Quick.. quick..Jasmine is in the library.. ..and is going towards her car. Go and walk her to the car. You can talk to her while you walk.Come.. How do you know that?-Dude. l'm Genius. Come on. Go. Go.. Hey, Jasmine. Hi Aladin. Are you leaving? Yes. Studied enough for today. l'll walk you to the car. No. l can go. My car is right here. No. l insist. Let me help you with this. - Aladin.-Please. That's my car. lt's right here.. - Yes. Thanks. Good parking. Bye. Why didn't you see where the car was? Why should l see the car? Do you want Jasmine or the car? Go.. go.. - Are you sure? - Yes. She is going to the restroom. Come on, Brother. This is your chance to ask her for a dance. Go on. Let Aladin go first. His stomach is upset. He has diarrhoea. Okay? Jasmine, let Aladin go first.. ..he has diarrhoea. Sure, go ahead. This one. Sure? - 110%. This is Jasmine's house. - This is Jasmine's .. This is not her house, this is her room. This is a girls hostel. They have rooms here. This is Jasmine's room. - Okay. Now, you won't speak or do anything.. ..because every time you open your mouth, things go wrong. Asking for your help was the stupidest thing l ever did. l wasted my third wish. Oh, l see. Now, l am the villain? You were wasting your third wish. You cried buckets. And l didn't cry, okay? Right. When did you cry.. ..l'm the one who is crying now.. Aladin.. no.. no. You may be.. ..maybe not. - The enemy. - Enemy? Take this. Karate chop. You. - No. l'm just leaving. Hey, Aladin. - Why didn't you warn me? Wow! You're blaming me? l tried so hard to tell you. You did all this intentionally. Why would l do that? l'm here to help you, remember? l can leave once your third wish is fulfilled. What kind of stupid help is this? Do you think l am a fool? Yes. No. Yes. Brother, what happened to your voice? Sometimes like a broken foghorn.. Why? Didn't you see? She karate-chopped me. What? - That crazy nut. Oh, boy. Your voice is one hell of a deal-breaker. lf l were Jasmine, even l would have dumped you. No, Sorry. Sorry. Sorry of my life. The more l love someone, the further away they go from me. Hey. Come on. Where? - Trust me. Come on. Come on. Are you insane? l am not doing this again. Just shut up and listen. l will sing. You just move your lips. What? - Yes. Just trust me. Do as l say. That's what l'm worried about. What did you say? Nothing. Genius. You're the one. You're the one. Baby, you're the one. You're the one. You're the one. Baby, you're the one. You may be.. Just a little bit silly.. ..a little bit crazy. But baby you're the one. There is no other girl like you silly.. ..who is a little crazy. But baby you're the one. You're the one. l don't love anyone else. l will never love anyone else. lf you ask for the stars.. ..l'll pluck them out of the sky for you. You only have to say so. ..and l'll love you forever. You may be.. ..just a little bit silly. A little bit crazy. But baby, you're the one. You're the one. You're the one. Baby, you're the one. You're the one. You're the one. Baby, you're the one. All my dreams breathe within your eyes.. Dreams in such bloom that everything else seems dull. This is a new world. ..and never before has anyone.. ..loved someone so completely ever. You may be.. ..just a little.. - ..just a little bit silly. just a little bit silly. A little bit crazy. But baby, you're the one. - You're the.. l don't love anyone else. - l don't love anyone else. l will never love anyone else. - l will never love anyone else. lf you ask for the stars.. l'll pluck them out of the sky for you.. You only have to say so. ..and l'll love you forever. There is no girl like you. There is no girl like you - ..who is a little crazy. But baby, you're the one. You're the one. You're the one. Baby, you're the one. You're the one. You're the one. - Baby.. Baby, you're the one. - Baby, you're the one. lf she turns and glances at you, then it means she loves you. How do you know? Turn. - Hey, no magic. Brother. At least trust your love lf you don't trust me. Turn. Come on. Come on. There. She is coming towards me. Why? You want her to go towards Kasim? ls your diarrhoea all right now? Yes. The situation was delicate for a couple of days.. ..but now, he's just fine. Good. So, would you like to go for dinner tonight? With me? Yes. - Yes. - Yes. - Great. Genius.. - Yeah! Do you like this? Mind blowing, Brother. Trust me. l don't understand why boys don't wear clothes like these anymore.. Maybe they think.. ..they'll end up looking like waiters.. Aladin. What are you looking at? l am worried. Someone might just call me over to order food. You look dashing in that suit. But like a waiter, right? Little bit. lt's nice. Thanks. The suit is great.. ..but did you bring a present for me ? Present? l.. l brought one. Specially picked out for you. Tak Dhina Din. Aladin. How did you do that? A simple trick. My grandfather taught me. Very good. You have a bright future as a thief. But l'll start by stealing something of yours. Aladin. l have to go. Okay. Thank you so much for this evening. l will never forget this time we spent. Aladin, l was just.. Thank you. l'm just going to the restroom, not home. May l clear this? - Sure. Dessert? Thank you. Nice suit, sir. Alu, before l whack you.. ..tell me where did you find the courage to take Jasmine out? Look at me. Where did you find the courage? This is your problem, not mine. Hello. Alu. Where? From you. l just followed your advice. Remember the lamp you gave me. l rubbed it.. ..and a genie came out of it. He granted me not one.. ..but three wishes. Though l wasted two of them.. ..l asked for his help in the third wish. l asked for Jasmine. And then, Jasmine asked me out herself. Alu, don't try to act smart. - Jasmine. Look, Jasmine is here. Scram now.. Get it? Kasim - Hi. What are you doing here? Brother. lt's now or never. Kasim came to tell you.. ..that he can't go to the Students' Ball with you. Yes. He has done it. Thank God. l was worried about how to tell you.. ..that l want to go to the Ball with Aladin. What's up! - You want to go with him? With this fool? Come on, Jasmine. He is not good enough for you. Look at him. He looks like a.. ..waiter. Yes? You called? What about the bill? Out. Just leave. Hey.. Yes. - How dare you? l'll show you first.. ..and then l'll get Alu. Buddy.. No one can take Jasmine away from Kasim. Sir.. Who hit me? - You. Hey. Old man. Hey. Old man. Hit me, come on. 'Old man?' Old man. Old man. You know Kasim. You don't love Jasmine. You love garbage. - What? Yes. My love. My love. My love. My love. My love. - You too. Darling. Aladin Chatterjee. l think l am falling in love with you. Genius So, we meet again. l wish we hadn't. Genius. ls this how you greet a friend? You are not my friend. Never were. And never.. - Wait a minute. l know what's next. Let me say it. 'And will never be'. ls that right? What do you want? - What do l want? What do l want? l want two words. Two teeny-weeny words. Every.. ..and thing? 'Everything'. And in the same order. The 'every' first.. ..and the 'thing' later. Because there is no use wanting 'thing-every', is there? So.. l want everything. Greed has brought you to this.. ..and greed will lead you to your end. Wrong. lf l die, it will be due to your constant lecturing. Hey, Genius, Now, that's an idea to kill me. Just give me a few more of these great moral lectures of yours.. ..and l'll die of boredom. What was my fault? Just that.. ..l used my powers for myself. And for that, you genies took away all of my powers. l did not harm anyone. Just used my powers for myself. That's it. We took an oath when we became genies? Our lives and our powers.. Are for others. We give. We don't take. - Very good. So, you give.. ..but l'm in the mood to take. First, the lamp.. ..and then that boy's life. lf you.. Oh, no. Genius, What happened? Are you okay? Out of all the useless oaths, why do you always forget.. ..that one Genie oath? l will never harm the owner of the lamp.. ..or the person who holds any part of the lamp. Meet him. He is my bodyguard, Sher Singh. Sher Singh.. This is Genius. Say 'hello.' Hello Genius.. How are you? lf l wanted to, l could kill you right now, Genius. But where's the fun in that? People will say.. Ringmaster found Genius alone and killed him. lf you try to harm Aladin.. Don't blame me for your mistake, Genius. You Genies chose him to stop me, didn't you? So, now, he will have to die. Genius. Genius. Now, l get why you are so fond of that orphan. You haven't told him the truth yet, have you, Genius? You are a smart guy. l have to go, Genius. See you soon. l promise. Genius. l was waiting for you. What's the matter? You look really happy. l thought you'd left. Oh, so that's why you were so happy, you ingrate? Absolutely not. The thing is.. Jasmine said.. 'l love you' to me. What are you saying, Brother? Mind blowing. Congratulations. And what did you say? l? l didn't say anything.. - Oh, no. You're such an idiot. You should have told her that you love her too. Your third wish would have been complete. And then? - Then what? Then.. Love, marriage etcetera. Live happily ever after. No. Not that. Then what about you? What about me? l will push off. Wishes granted, job over. Genius. Goodbye. Out of here. Please don't go. Don't leave. Genius, stay with me. Why do you want to leave? No. l am not. l mean.. When did l say? You know, Aladin.. lt's the rules. Once my job is done, l have to go away. This is what always happens with me. Everyone leaves me. When l was a kid, my parents left me.. ..and then a few years ago, grandpa. And now.. ..even you will.. You always tease me about this.. ..about why l always wear this 'A' for Aladin like.. ..a board around my neck? This 'A' isn't for Aladin, Genius. This 'A' is for Arun. This is my father's sweater. That's why l always keep it with me. When l had no one to call my own.. ..you came into my life. Genius. l don't want you to leave me like everyone else did. Can you? Can't you stay with me forever? l will always be with you. May be not physically.. ..but whenever you need me.. ..l will be there. Promise? - Yes, promise.. You're the best. Okay. l have to finish an assignment. Aladin. - Yes? No, nothing. Go finish your assignment. We'll talk tomorrow. Aladin. Were you responsible for my parent's death? Aladin. Listen to me. You don't know the whole story. - l don't care. Yes or no? Aladin, don't be stupid. Yes or no? Genius.. Please say 'no'. Please. Yes. You? But.. - All this while that you were with me.. l thought l had at last found someone to call family.. ..but you betrayed my trust. Aladin, listen to me. Aladin. Aladin. My friend. Now, you have just two choices. Either you can join me for a cup of tea.. ..or you could go outside and try and save Aladin. l know it's difficult.. ..but you can at least try.. ..because sometimes those who try, succeed. Cheers. Hey! Stop. Stop. Stick around? Very funny. Watch it. Hey, Aladin. Where's the lamp? Oh. Rub-a-dub-rub.. Where is the lamp? - At home. Hello, Genius. How are you? 'Ringmaster'. l suspected him that very day. He's too old to be Aladin's cousin. He's at least as old as his uncle. Saving Aladin time and again has become his habit, darling. My friend. Don't ask why.. ..but Aladin has to die. Don't ask why.. ..but Aladin has to die. He won't do it. lf he refuses, he will lose his powers and turn into a human being.. ..because he took another stupid oath when he became a genie.. ..that he will obey every command of the lamp's owner. lsn't that so, my friend? - No. Don't ask for that.. - Hey. The lamp, Genius, belongs to me.. ..and l want my wishes three. My friend. Make my fantasy a reality.. ..find and kill Aladin for me.. Did you hear that, Genius? Did you hear the first boom? Boom. Then Let there be light. Genius. Come out, my friend. You dirty rogue, come out. What happened? Breaking news. Love has destroyed Genius. Genius has now become human.. ..now, he can't harm us anymore. That's all from the news-desk. Whatever happened today, started.. ..in an incident that occurred 20 years ago. That day, everyone was looking for that one special object. Arun wanted the lamp..' ..so he could help people. Ringmaster wanted the lamp.. ..so that he could catch the comet and go back to being a Genie.. ..and the lamp itself was looking for.. ..its rightful owner. Legend says, the only person worthy of the lamp.. ..is the one who has no greed in his heart. And what meant to be.. happened. You found the lamp. But you threw it away. A piece of the lamp broke and fell off. What happened next changed everything.. - Aladin. You handed over that piece of the lamp.. Aladin. To Ringmaster. Fortunes changed, destiny was rewritten. Arun hadn't even seen the lamp.. ..so, he couldn't understand why Ringmaster was asking for it. But Riya understood.. She found the lamp.. ..and she summoned me by rubbing it. A Genie cannot harm anyone who has a piece of the lamp. A Genie becomes powerless in such a situation. Ringmaster had a piece of the lamp.. ..and so, l could not harm him in any way. l was forced to ask Arun to fire the gun.. l had to save you at any cost.. - Shoot. He threatened to throw you off the cliff. Arun didn't want to shoot.. Shoot. But l forced him to. The sound of the gun-shot caused an avalanche.. ..and by the time l returned after saving you.. ..it was all over. But.. Why did you only save me? Why not everybody? Because that was your mother's first wish.. 'Please take Aladin home safely.' Aladin, are you up? Cousin. You? Why are you looking so roughed up? Just a minute, just a minute. Please let me understand this. Aladin had a lamp.. .. and you came out of it.. ..because he rubbed you? Not me. He rubbed the lamp. Margina. That must be Jasmine. Margina, have you seen Aladin? Aladin. l've been looking for you since morning.. This is complicated. Let me understand this. Aladin had a lamp.. ..and you came out of it.. ..because he rubbed you? There is no point in wasting our time on Aladin.. ..whether he likes it or not, he'll have to come stop me.. ..and l love it when someone stops me from doing something. But why me? Through the ages, someone has always been chosen to protect.. ..the lamp against misuse. lt's the decree of the Genies. This time around, you were chosen. Out of a million people on this earth.. ..you had to pick me to fight that Ringmaster? Out of the million people in the world.. ..you are the only one who can fight Ringmaster. So, what should we do now? First, let's find out where we can catch the comet. And then? Before Ringmaster catches the comet, we'll have to stop him. But the comet will pass overhead, in the sky.. ..then how will we catch it from down here, on earth? Not the comet, we'll catch the reflection of the comet. But from where? We'll catch it from here. Memorial building? But it's the Students' Ball there tomorrow night. Even better. l'm hoping you'll get us free passes. l'm standing outside the Memorial building.. ..where the Students' Ball is about to begin in a few minutes.. ..and in some time, we'll also see the comet passing.. ..over Khwaish, right at this very spot.. ..this is that same comet that is seen once in a million years. Tonight is the night. Watch out. We have our eyes on you. Tonight is the night? We know exactly what's going on. Tonight is the night. Watch out. We have our eyes on you. Tonight is the night. Look out. Watch out. We have our eyes on you. We know exactly what's going on. Together, all over.. We will rock your world. Watch out. We have our eyes on you. We know exactly what's going on.

We have our eyes on you. Tonight is the night. Watch out, watch out. We have our eyes on you. lt's the moment of reckoning. But then, why is it waiting? What is it afraid of? Tell me. lt's a magic wand. Carved with blood. Where is it hidden? Tell me. lt's a snake's hiss. lt's a burning star. All will be in my grasp. Stop me if you can. lt is a snake's hiss. lt is a burning star. All will be in my grasp. Stop me if you can. Come on, come on. Show us what you've got. Come on, let's face off.

Watch out, watch out watch out. lt's a gamble with poison. lt's the smoke of disaster. And it's brought the world to a stop. The scorpion will sting. Then it will laugh. lt will drag the world to the grave. This is the web l spin. This is the way l roll. And l invite your death. Stop me if you can. This is the web l spin. This is the way l roll. And l invite your death. Stop me if you can. Come on, come on. Show us what you've got. Come on, come on. Show us what you've got. Come on, come on. Show us what you've got. Come on, come on.

This show is over. Go home. Did you find the lamp? Kids nowadays, they just don't listen. Where is Jasmine? Watch out. We have our eyes on you. Tonight is the night. No. Come on, Genius. You send a woman to steal the lamp? This girl is more than a match for you. And now, l'm angry. Finish off Aladin. Hey, Genius. Show us what you've got. Now. - Now. My turn. Mark this day, date and hour, Genius. Because l'm about to change the ending of this fairytale. What's the hurry? Aladin. Genius. We'll meet again, my friend. Genius. Sorry, sorry. Aladin. Let me show you the true power of the lamp. No. No. Not the comet, he'll catch the reflection of the comet. Aladin.. You decide. Good boy. Tak Dhina Din Aladin. Aladin. The end. My friend. You know Jasmine.. ..that lovely ballad he sang for you.. Yes? - 'You may be..' That was actually me singing. - What? - But why? My love, you're beautiful. Kasim? Beautiful. Will you go out on a date with me? Please. Please, don't say no. Please. Hi, Kasim. Alu? Jasmine. Alu. No one can take Jasmine away from Kasim. Come on. Fight with me. Come on. Fight.. Just a minute. Just a minute. This is your problem, not mine. Jasmine, let's go. All right, guys, have fun. - Come on. Hit me. Come on. Don't worry. - Aladin.. He is not the old Aladin anymore. He is different. Alu..
