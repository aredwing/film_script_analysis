Hinoyoujin ( Beware of Fire ) Japan Edo Era (1603-1868) This is the story of Yaoya Oshichi ( ca. 1667 29 March 1683 ) O-ume? There's nothing I can help you yet? I'm sorry Princess, I'll be back as soon as I drop this. O-Waka-chan!! Matsuki-chan!! Eat. O-Waka-chan!! Matsuki-chan!! O-ume you are not quite good. Right? I'll go see. Sada-don! Sadakichi-don! Yes. Where's the fire? There's anyone on the rooftop? I'm on my way. It's in the Honjo district. You know? Also the wind comes from the northwest. Don't worry. Matsuki-san? The son of the neighbor! Isn't he?! The love of Matsuki-san for fire will give him trouble. Right? Matsuki! Where did he go? Told you to keep an eye on him if the fire bell was heard. Where did the keeper go? Send people to the fire chief place. Tell him I said not to let him in to the place of fire. It took a lot of dealing. You heard it? Dear, will you talk about that again? It's because Naritaya-san has a reputation of being meticulous. Right? Even that is a fanatic of arrangements. Well, O-wakama introduce yourself. My name is Wakama. She's being taught to act normal in a general way, bur... It's because she dont know the meaning of '' hard work '' O-Waka -chan! Matsuki-chan! Son of a bitch! '' This body of mine have I received for my parents... ..And to keep it safe from harm is my first filial duty...'' Don't you know? Matsukichi! You are not just some clerk sitting on a reception to have irezumi. You are disinherited! O-Waka-chan. Matsuki-chan! What happened? I've just been said by my father that I'm disinherited. But... Matsuki-san... You are his only son. Aren't you? It doesn't matter. I was being forced to... From now on, finally I'll become a firefighter. You were like this since you were a child. Matsuki-san. But... if that happens... I... I want to see you Matsuki-san. I want to see you as soon as possible. Don't worry. I'll come to see you. Matsuki-chan. Did you forget it? What about? The promise we made when we were children. When we were children? Yes. When we were children. So the wedding is the 3th of the next month isnt it? Before that, she must go to Kobikichou to see her grandmother and say something about the Obi. I wonder if I misheard it.... Matsuki-san. O-ume! You all right? Run! Hurry! You are in the way! You are in the way! Out of my way! Matsu! Where's Matsuki? Yes! Boss! I'm here. The origin of the fire is near your neighborhood. Can you climb the rooftops and give instructions to demolish the houses? Trust me please! My house... O-Waka-chan house too... In any moment it will take the left of that store in the southeast. If it surpass to the northeast it will be dangerous. At the other side of the street there is a tenement house If the fire spread to there... ... It will reach the Honganji temple. Understood.

We are begging you to help us. Exterminate the demon, please! Since then, that demon, night after night keeps coming... Kidnaps young girls, and destroys everything, Already in this town, thats the only girl left. We are not able to hold that girl any longer. There's nothing to do. No one can match with that thing... Kao! O-samurai-sama, I beg you! In the name of God and Buddah, we depend on you, Samurai-sama. A bear! There's nothing to do... nothing to do... A demon came. Save me... please... Gambo?
