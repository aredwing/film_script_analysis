After pursuing every whispered rumor... ...and battling for 1 00 years through countless foul pits... ...its dark power is finally within my reach. Now, retribution is at hand. Nothing can keep me from it. There is no path too perilous or hazard too great. The specter of death does not daunt me... ...for I am already dead. Giving birth to this nightmare is my most coveted dream. I will see them all burn. As my pain ends... ...theirs begins. At last I am free of this undead curse. The Orb of Falazure is mine. What chance does lsmir have against me now? Sir, the problem remains that Halifax has threatened not to sign your law... ...for the new sewer if you cut off the supply of wheat. So, as you can clearly see, we must act now. My lord? Are you listening to me? All I do is listen. My days are filled with nothing more than figures... ...and reports and compromise. I'm growing as soft as the velvet cushions upon my chair. Sir Berek, you are a minister in the House of Lords. Urgent matters of state are at hand. This should be your concern. Not some... ...boyish duel. My lord. Valerious! Have you forgotten all my lessons? You parry when you should attack. The captain of the king's guard should always press forward. Forward, boy. Fetch that rusty blade of yours and let us settle this in the battle circle. Unless, of course... ...you prefer that I come up to your chamber... ...where we might joust with... ...quills. Men, this is Sir Berek. Former captain of the king's guard and, at one time, my teacher. Sir Berek, I sincerely hope this doesn't keep you from your duties... ...as royal tax advisor. As of this moment, Valerious, the instructions resume. Barely. You are the most talented of all my students, Valerious. The care of the king is in good hands. Officers, prepare your men. We march at dawn. I long to join you. There's nothing quite like lying exhausted on the battlefield... ...victorious. Your place is here. In lsmir. On the contrary, my value lies in the field. You saw the results in the battle circle. I did. Unfortunately, you did not. Instead of the plume, it could have been your head. You let me win? Why? Berek, you will always be my captain... ...and I will never forget what you have taught me. Especially this last lesson. And what lesson is that? To recognize... ...when it's time to sheath your sword for good. Damn it, Berek. Now is that any kind of language for the wife of a lord? I have picked up some dubious habits since we met. Well, it's always been my ambition to sully the virtue of a well-bred mage. Virtue is the least of my worries. What's wrong, my love? I bought this scroll from the Temple of Obadhai. I've been trying to mend these gloves using divine magic. Unsuccessfully, I might add. Divine magic? There are two different forms of magic. Mages like myself work with the arcane. Our power comes through knowledge and endless hours of study. Divine magic is completely different. It's granted by the gods. Certainly nobody in lsmir can do it, which is why... ...if I'm successful, a position on the Council of Mages is guaranteed. Well, don't let me stand between you and greatness. Perhaps we were destined to remain in our current stations. Excuse me. Yes? Is there something we can help you with? Sir Berek, I have traveled from Saragasso. -An evil has descended on our village. -What kind of evil? It's something terrible. Deep inside Mount Hearth. Two of our menfolk entered the cave on its slope yesterday morning. They have yet to return. Please, we need your help. -Poison gas. -lt is as I said. Stay behind me. Those holes must lead to some unknown source of evil deep in the mountain. Evil, yes. Unknown, maybe not. Berek, do you know what this is? When I was with the freebooters... ...we plundered the ruins of ancient Turan. Berek. Hurry. And there we discovered hieroglyphics which depicted... ...a colossal black dragon sleeping in the heart of Hearth Mountain. -Then those holes.... -Are not holes at all. -They're nostrils. -Please, Sir Berek... ...what are we going to do? What shall I tell my people? Tell them to flee. The Tomes of Turan. This is all we have left of their civilization. Should we wake the Council of Mages? No. Let's first find out if the Turanians can shed any light on this. Are these similar to the hieroglyphics you saw in the temple? They're identical. It's indecipherable. Maybe the text is hidden. The symbols are jumbled the same way in the books. -lf we can figure a way to combine them-- -That could take weeks. A vision spell might reveal how to decipher these books. -What do you need? -Four sticks of ivory and incense. -The expensive kind. -Good thing I'm a lord. -What happened? -I don't know. You tell me. You screamed, and the table exploded. Are you hurt? I had the strangest visions. I saw the Turanian mages. There was a sphere, a black orb. And then.... I can't remember. You're ice-cold. It's the strain of spell-casting. I'll be fine. Melora, your hair. I'm taking you to a healer. Look. What does it say? Can you decipher it. " Be the snowflake, the cleansing flame... ...the ancient stone, the endless wind." The four elements. My God. The Libram. A dragon, buried in Hearth Mountain? What is this I hear of creeping poison and buried dragons? My dear girl, are you so covetous of a position in Council... ...that you're willing to fabricate a drama? With all due respect, she's not fabricating anything. I saw it with my own eyes. -What did you discover? -Not l, Your Majesty. Three thousand years ago, Falazure... ...the evil dragon god of decay and undeath... ...descended upon the ancient civilization of Turan. The Turanian mages drew their power from the elemental forces of nature... ...earth, air, fire and water... ...and they had become so powerful that they refused to pay Falazure tribute. Whole cities were razed. Thousands died. But in the end, the Turanians were able to defeat the night dragon. Nonsense. You can't kill a god. The Turanians were able to imprison Falazure within Hearth Mountain... ...and trap his powers in a black orb. Where did you hear such tales? The Libram of Turan. I've heard, but how? Where? -Here. -Here? In lsmir's library. Hidden for 1 000 years. Tell me more about this orb. Where is it kept? Even without all his powers, Falazure is still a mighty dragon. There's no prison that could hold him indefinitely. So the Turanians placed the orb in suspended animation... -...that kept the dragon dormant. -Then they built a fortress... ...around the orb to ensure that Falazure would never rise again. So why does he stir now? The Turanians never recovered from their battle with Falazure. Their cities crumbled, and their magic was lost. For over 1 000 years now... ...no one maintained the defenses guarding the orb. Your Majesty, we fear that someone... ...has penetrated the weakened Turanian fortress... ...and removed the orb from its suspension. So when will Falazure awaken? The Libram says the night dragon will free himself by the dark of the first new moon. And the land will be consumed by wickedness. He will kill us all. -What are they doing? -It's a discern-location spell. They're combining their power to try and find the orb. I have broken your paltry spell. You were right to cower before me. It is good practice for the coming age. For I am Damodar. My master, Profion... ...cursed me to return as a corpse creature should I fail him... ...which I did not! He was killed before the damnation could be removed. For 100 years... ...my sole companion was unbearable agony. But now, I am whole again... ...and the Orb of Falazure is mine. I will annihilate... ...the descendents of those who defeated me. When the almighty... ...and all-encompassing power of the night dragon awakes... ...he will grant me a boon... ...and I will rain down my revenge on you. What happened, Oberon? What did you see? Did you see the orb? Ismir is in grave danger. She's so beautiful. -Don't you think? -Pretty. Pretty. Not for much longer. Tell Valerious to return to lsmir city at once. The fate of the kingdom may depend upon it. Your Majesty. Sir Berek, how is Melora? Still weak from the vision spell, but she'll be ready to help the other mages... -...when the time comes. -We need to get the orb from Damodar... ...but his spells have prevented us from divining its whereabouts. I wish to summon five of lsmir's greatest heroes. A party small enough not to alert Damodar to its presence... ...but strong enough to take the orb from him. You have summoned Valerious, but he will only be back in three days. Any delay may prove fatal. I shall go in his stead. Berek... ...it is my belief that if lsmir is to be saved, it will be by your hands. I summoned you here to help me choose your comrades. I should start with Lux. No one in Ismir is more ferocious in battle. A reckless temperament runs in that family. You bloody fool. My map. For wisdom, there is Dorian, a cleric of Obadhai. He and I were part of the party that stormed the ghost tower of lnverness. Do you see anything? Gentlemen, shoes are not allowed in this sacred space. His piety is only matched by his power. Sorcery must be fought with sorcery. -There's always Ormaline. -Of course. The elf wizard. But she hasn't left her island in decades. Yes, I know. A wizard, eh? Of what? Bait fishing? She's a skillful adventurer... ...and it is rumored that she seeks a challenge great enough... ...to test her powers. We must impress upon her the importance of this quest. Although he is sometimes as dark as the shadows that he walks through... ...if secrecy is the goal of this quest, no one is more stealthy... -... than Nim. -The rogue? Saint Peerless the Purehearted, ripe for the pickings... ...just like I promised. There's your share. Now beat it. -Are you trying to cheat me? -I'm not trying, runt. I'm doing it. A formidable group. It is my experience that those with such talent are difficult to control. It is this level of skill that will save Ismir. Without it, we have nothing. Berek, you must not fail. The forces of evil are gathering, and the righteous citizens of lsmir are in peril. You five have been summoned here to represent them... ...and to be the champions of all that is good. Cunning, wisdom... ...intelligence and strength, together but without direction. Berek, it is your duty to lead this quest. You must find Falazure's orb and return it to lsmir. It shall be done. To the Council of Mages goes the task... ...of discovering how to place the orb back into suspended animation. Without that knowledge, its recovery is useless. Two perilous tasks. Both must be completed before the night dragon awakes... ...and destroys us all. If one fails, they both fail. But do not despair, proceed in the belief that your comrades will succeed... ...and we will be victorious. I'm ready. -What do we have tonight? -Drow. The ecstasy of life. The barbarian is very beautiful. Melora, you know she was chosen for her skill in battle, not her looks. So you agree that she is beautiful. You waste your energy on such thoughts, but I'll not leave you while you're unwell. Berek, I'll be fine. You must go. -This illness is unnatural. -My strength is returning. I am merely preserving it for the days ahead. Ismir needs you more than l. Hey, rogue, do you want a hand up? You'll be the one who'll be needing a hand... ...if you don't take that paw off me. Rogue, it's too early to be spilling blood. Even for me. Sir Berek, I don't have to remind you that time is of the essence. I understand all too well, Your Majesty. It is precisely for this reason that we journey to Malek's vault. Malek built a pool of the sight. It'll penetrate Damodar's defenses and show us the orb's location. Then Ormaline can teleport us there. Many adventurers have sought Malek's vault. None have returned. Ismir is at risk, so risks are what we must take. Do you know the location of this evil place? I don't, but I know who does. -Who? -The goblins of Kurtl. Tell me, Lux, what did your brother see at Barrier Peaks that drove him crazy? -Tread carefully, rogue. -I am treading carefully. I was at the Lincroft lnn the night Jatt killed all those people. As was l. Yes, and if memory serves, it was your sword that ended his madness. How to be sure that she, too, won't go berserk and put us all at risk? Do you doubt my control? The next time you try that, you'd better kill me. As captain of the king's guard, duty demanded that I confront your brother. Duty is why I am on this quest. And I have no quarrel with you. Falazure stirs. The tremors are growing in frequency. Consider it an incentive. But, sir, the Libram remains a mystery. Why, if they intended for us to use their magic... ...would the Turanians hide it so well? I'm sure the Turanian mages... ...did not want this might falling into unworthy hands. Which it obviously has. But how do we prove our worth... ...to mages dead over 1 000 years? -What is this? Explain. -I'm summoning a magmin. For what purpose? Well, the Turanians drew their power from the elemental forces of nature. I thought perhaps a creature born of fire and earth... ...might provide insight into their lore. A magmin is of moderate intelligence at best. What knowledge do you hope to gain? Perhaps such a small creature will be the first step in unraveling the bigger mystery. Continue, but be careful, for you look unwell... ...and magmin are as wild and dangerous as the forces that birth them. Protect the Libram. He'll set fire to it. Lord Oberon, this news would be better served coming from you. Yes, yes, I see. Thank you. You're dying. Your body is decaying from the outside in. When the corruption reaches your brain you will die... ...and then be reborn as one of the undead. Like Damodar. I think Damodar penetrated my vision spell. Is it possible he infected me with the same curse that afflicts him? He will need a part of you to maintain the curse. My hair. My hair. Somehow he took some of my hair. How can this be? Perhaps the orb gave him such vulgar power. How long do I have? I cannot say... ...but the strain of spell-casting will hasten the end. Melora... ...if I've been hard on you over the years... ...it's only because I saw in you the potential... ...to be a great mage. I'm truly sorry. Heart Shorn Wood. Must we travel through this corrupted place? It is the shortest way to the Mudwash River. From there we can sail to the goblin village of Kurtl. -Going around would take too long. -Can't you just teleport us there? As I have never been to Kurtl, I have nothing to visualize. I might teleport us 100 leagues in the wrong direction. What are your thoughts, Nim? I think never before have I heard such blubbering. -Some champions. -The rogue is right. Berek, lead on. We trust you. Blessed are the works in nature that provide for those in need. Nim, surely there is something you can be doing to help. What do you think the goblins of Kurtl know of Malek anyway? The goblins worship the demon, Juiblex. Together they helped Malek build the pool of sight. You don't say? Malek used the pool to find virgins on the eve of their weddings. He would teleport into their chambers and steal them to his vault. There he would sacrifice them to the demon lord. -Then you know how Malek died. -About 100 years ago... ...Malek got caught. Hung, drawn and quartered. Pieces of his body were dipped in acid. Body dipped in acid, yes, yes, we've all heard that one before. Do you want to know what really happened? -Speak your mind, rogue. -As a cruel joke... ...Juiblex created a flaw within the pool of sight. Unbeknownst to Malek, every time he used it... ...there was a chance he'd get an imperfect vision. About 100 years ago... ...Malek teleported himself into a brick wall. Why don't you go and give Lux a hand. Sure thing. -Berek, help me! I'm hurt! -Dorian? Oh, great Obadhai, it hurts. Lux! Nim! It's Dorian! Help me, Berek! Berek, Berek, I'm hurt. Help me, Berek. Dorian, how did this happen? How do you think it happened? This damn tree fell on me. Come on, get it off me. You transgress into the necropolis of Klaxx the Malign. Most recently, I have been experimenting with a spell... ...to disintegrate one limb at a time. Let me show you how far I have progressed. Flee! The Lich is too powerful! Kill them all. Drain their lives. Back to the raft. Now! Dorian, the specters. Banish them. In the name of Obadhai, I banish you unholy abominations. You should have known better, Berek. You seem to have left yours in the Lich. I want it back. When this is over. Want some? What troubles you, Berek? I blundered into that trap like a farm boy on his first campaign. Fool. You punish yourself unnecessarily. Going off alone to save a comrade is a brave deed. Brave? I nearly got us all killed. But you didn't. Obadhai's benevolence saw to it. We got lucky, and there's too much at stake to rely on luck. Berek... ...there's a weapon for good other than magic and steel. What is it then? That's something you'll have to discover for yourself. But when you've found it, you'll know what it is. There's a vital element in the Turanian magic that we fail to understand. We're lacking something. Melora. I can still help. Give me your hand. Your heart still beats. But understand that at the first sign of your conversation to the undead... ...I will incinerate you. The forces of evil hear the call of the orb. They wait to pick the rotting dead carcass of lsmir. Good times. Indeed. Stay. Beware, Lich. I have the powers of the orb at my disposal. The full strength of the orb is beyond your mastery. You wield but only a fraction of its might. Enough to fry your rotten bones... ...and send you back to whatever foul pit you crawled out from. Perhaps, but you misunderstand my intentions. I am on a mission of goodwill. Lord Damodar, is it your ambition to reunite Falazure with the orb... ...thus unleashing his evil onto the world? You may count on it. I would be dismayed... ...if the spread of misery across the land occurred without my contribution. A Lich has loyalty to none but itself. Lord Damodar, a quest has set out from lsmir. Five champions sail towards the goblins of Kurtl. Five champions, you say? More like five field mice... ...unaware the hawk's shadow has fallen on their backs. Let them think in their ignorance... ...that lsmir still has hope. It'll make it all the sweeter when they are torn to pieces. -The goblins? Where are they? -It's a massacre. Who could have done this? Not who, but what. How will we ever find the pool of sight now? This looks like the shaman's hut. If there is any clues to Malek's vault, they'll be in here. Ormaline, see if there's any magic. What kind of ring is it? I need time and study to determine its function. Smite. There's a secret door beneath the bed. Your wit should be as fast as your hands. It's a trap. Stand back, all of you. I want you all to see what would have happened... ...if I wasn't here. Go ahead. You saved my life. -I am in your debt. -No, you're not. Nobody's ever given me anything before... ...so that makes us even. Stomach acid of a purple worm. Eat through anything. The map to Malek's vault. Damodar will never know what hit him. It's an ambush. Everybody, out! Scatter! Dorian! Ormaline, when I give a signal, cast a lightning bolt. Nim, use that acid. Damn you! Die! Ormaline, now. There, the tears of the earth are dried. There, the hidden things are clear. There, the works of life are tried... ...by a juster judge than here. If any of you wish to depart this quest, the time is now. There will be no turning back once we enter Malek's vault. So you will continue on? Alone, if need be. There are friends and families to protect... ...and there is no dishonor in choosing them over lsmir. Well... ...I've no friends, no family... ...and I would like to repay Damodar for this treachery. I, too, will join you. I'm with you to the end. Our duty is to lsmir. The orb comes first. Dorian would have wanted it that way. But if there's a chance to kill Damodar in the process... ...then by all means, let's gut the bastard. Lord Oberon? Sir, look. These runes start on page 892... ...and end on page 884. Page 893 is missing. -Has it been torn out? -No. Look... ...882 is on one side... ...884 on the other. Either 893 never existed... ...or it has been concealed. What do the runes say? They say fire reveals all. Is it your belief that setting fire to the Libram... ...will reveal page 893? This is what the magmin was trying to show us. -We can't burn the Libram. -We need proof... ...before we can proceed with such a drastic measure. Lord Oberon, she is part undead. This idea might originate... ...from the evil that corrupts her body. Melora... ...test your heart. Does this belief come from what you are or what you are becoming? My heart.... My heart tells me that this is a test of our belief. The Turanian lore remains closed to us... ...because we have yet to show our faith in it. We must prove ourselves worthy of this power. No! Look, acorns and oak leaves. Melora... ...raise your head. Follow it! Fire... ...wind... ...water, earth. The four elements. Well done, Melora. Well done. The map says it's supposed to be in this hollow. Everyone, over here. Take a look at this. A gem of true seeing. I never knew you had such a treasure. -I come prepared for everything. -Well done, Nim. "To all trespassers... ...if you wish to join the others in death, insert your name below... ...and I will notify your kin. Malek." It appears Malek was not without a sense of humor. Yes, but how do we get in? This is not good. Be on to lookout. Berek, remember the Shrine of Kuo-Toa? Yes, this is a puzzle lock. If we can spell out the right password-- Bandits! Lux, Ormaline, hold them off. This must be more of Damodar's treachery. There must be something contained in the text. Maybe a name. Did Malek have a wife or children? Wait, how do you spell Malek's name? M-A-L-E-K. Here it's spelled with an X. -The password contains an X. Why? -X. Nim, the demon who built the pool of sight? Juiblex. Berek, hurry! Lux! Ormaline! We got it! Lux! Barbarian, get ahold of yourself. Smite! Your Majesty... ...I mobilized the cavalry as soon as we got your message. The bulk of our legions will arrive on tomorrow's eve at the earliest. Valerious, tonight is the dark of the moon. -We will have to hold until then. -Any word of Berek on your travels? Do not put your faith in him, Your Majesty. Any hope of saving lsmir will come from the king's guard... ...and the strength of our steel. I think Melora has stumbled upon the essence of the Turanian lore. It's altogether... ...a new kind of magic. Something we've never seen before. Could be powerful. Yes, the girl's daring is invigorating me. It gives us all hope. That's good. Thank you, Pico. Yes, master. Amazing. She believes, and the lore opens up to her. Pico! Careful. Single file. I don't like the look of this. We all have to die sometime. Yes, but I'd prefer not right now. Berek, duck! Darkmantles! Run! Step aside. Hurry, Nim! Got it! Now what? Nim, look through your gem. Nothing, but the gem doesn't pierce anything mundanely concealed. Perhaps I can help. Fly. This is Ona... ...a friend of mine since childhood. She will investigate for us. Poor Ona. There must be a way across. Maybe a device to turn the energy field off. Search the walls, the floor, the ceiling. Berek, I think there's something behind this wall. Stand back. Strange, it looks like a mirror. Lux, lift me up. What is it? Oh, it's... ...some time type of lever... ...a very complex mechanism. -You'll have to all look away. -What for? I'm about to employ ancient secrets of the rogue's guild... ...that I alone in the world have the ability to execute. -I want it to stay that way. -Just hurry up, Nim. The mirror reflects a path. Okay, I'll go first. Ormaline, you follow, then Lux. Nim, you bring up the rear. If we stay on the path we should be safe. Watch the mirror. I will try to figure out how to operate this foul device. Nim, make haste. -He's not gonna make it. -Nim, only a few more steps. Jump, Nim. Jump! Is he alive? I think I feel a pulse. Ormaline, can you teleport him to a healer? I have only two teleportation spells prepared. One to take us to Damodar, another for the return trip to lsmir. He'll have to stay with us. -Malek. -The pool retains... ...the image of its last use. The operation is simple enough. We need only think of a subject or object... ...and its location will be revealed in the pool. I can teleport us to that destination... ...but this apparatus was constructed by a fiend... ...and success is not guaranteed, as you can see. We are fortunate. The room appears free of obstructions. Ormaline, you hit him with a lightning bolt. Lux, you know what to do. - I'll go for the orb. Ormaline. -Let's get on with it. Ismir's heroes in the flesh... ...and this is the best you can do. Ismir must be really desperate to have sent such fools. I was tempted to keep you alive so you could witness... ...the destruction of your beloved city. Unfortunately... I have never been able to control my urges. Even as a dead man. Smite! Help the others. You cannot win. Wrong. Lux, the orb. Berek, leave him. We've gotta help Nim and Ormaline. Hold on, we're almost home. Ormaline. Can you teleport all of us to lsmir? I can cast the spell... ...but I cannot join you. Not like this. Take us to the Temple of Obadhai. They are the best healers in the land. Lux, prepare a tourniquet. Ready when you are. Very well. Please, forgive me. Find my orb. These two just saved lsmir. Now, they must be saved. Your friends will be attended to. Now you must go. There are horses in the stable. Just go. Berek. We've been followed. -You must fly. -What about you? -I will buy you time to get to lsmir. -Here. Take this. Come villainy. Death awaits you. Hold, hold! Release! -Berek, you've done it. -Melora. Where's Melora? Berek. Damodar has cursed her. You've found the orb. I knew you would. Quick, place it here while there's still time. This is what I saw in my vision. The Turanian mages. The orb. Where is the orb? Oberon! You are alive... ...only by Damodar's graces. He wants you for himself. Well done, Lich. We'll see. This day, my life begins anew. Place the orb upon the ground. I only ask to witness the destruction of lsmir... ...and that I rule over its remains as your thrall. This lsmir shall be razed to mark the beginning of my reign. Your tribute will be 100 heads... ...for every new moon in honor of my release. As you wish, my lord. Reinforce the south wall! Archers! Oh, Melora. You can't die. I need you. Ismir needs you. Get down! Take aim! Release! Take aim! Release! Ismir is dying. -I can't. -Yes, you can. My friends believed even when I didn't... ...and that gave me the strength to do what I had to do. Dorian told me there was a weapon for good other than magic and steel. -Faith. -Yes. In my vision... ...I saw the Turanian mages on their knees. Yes, it has to be. They were praying. Who were they praying to? There was a mask made from acorns... ...and oak leaves in the Temple of Obadhai. The god of nature. He has power over all the elements. The Turanians were praying to Obadhai. What are you doing? To wield this power, I must prove my faith to Obadhai. -But it'll tear you to pieces. -Berek... ...let me go. Take me to the tower. Keep her alive! I don't care what it takes! You must keep her alive till I break Damodar's curse. Kill him. Kill him yourself, O great and powerful Damodar. Beautiful. The look on your face has made this whole endeavor worthwhile. And so it goes, Lich. She's dying. Take the orb. This is for Dorian, Nim and Ormaline. -Go back to hell. -Lux, no! Lux, control yourself. If you kill him, Melora dies. He has cursed her. What do I care of curses? Melora is all that stands between lsmir and destruction. Justice will be brought to this monster. I promise you. Lux... ...you are not your brother. Remove the curse... ...or I'll kill you and have you brought back into the agony of the undead. In time you will realize you have merely saved your own tomb. I look forward to watching you rot in it. We'll rot together then.
