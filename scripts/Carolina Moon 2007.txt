We have to retrieve the nuclear warhead... ...before they send their rescue force. Come on already. Hope. The Geiger counter's going crazy. It's here. I found it. I found the warhead. Tor, what is it? What's wrong? - Are you having a vision? - Yes. Somebody's watching us. Who? I can't tell. It's... ...blank. Leave us alone. It's getting late. I better go. We have to meet tonight to plan the attack on enemy headquarters. Right here, 8:35 sharp. I'll bring the lemonade. No. It's just your brother and my cousin. Hey, Hope. If Mom found out you were swimming without a grown-up around... If Mom found out, there'd be one less Cade Lavelle in the world. You won't tell my parents, will you, Wade? I don't know, coz. What's it worth to you? You guys said you were gonna wait up for me. "Mommy, I was so scared in the woods all alone. What if a snake came and bit me in my extra-double-giant-sized butt?" Oh, my God. It's a cottonmouth. Where is it? - You guys are such jerks. - Better a jerk than a dweeb. Dwight the dweeb, Dwight the dweeb. Dwight the dweeb, Dwight the dweeb. Dwight the dweeb. Boys are such boys. - Don't forget about tonight. - The woods are full of enemy spies. We need a password. Adventure. Make us ever grateful for thy mercy, Lord. For whosoever turneth against thy commandments... ...shalt thou smite with pain of the spirit and torment of the flesh. Amen. Blackberries are coming in so big and ripe. I might wanna get in a little canning this week... ...make a nice jelly. I love that blackberry jelly. I know I've got some paraffin here somewhere. If I could just think where it's gone to. Gone to? I work myself black and blue, every day of the week, but the Lord's. And you wonder where the things I buy for you have gone to. It's on the top shelf above the stove. Behind the molasses and the cornstarch. And how do you know where the wax is, Victoria? Up where you can't see it, you can't reach it... ...unless the devil showed it to you in your visions? - She must've seen me put it there. - Shut your pie hole. A year. A whole year since last canning season... ...and you remember... ...that it's exactly... ...between the molasses and the cornstarch. I'm sorry, Daddy. It just came to me. I promise I won't do it again. Open the door, Victoria. Baby, when the devil's got a child under his power... ...who's gonna set her free if her daddy doesn't? Mom? Forty-one, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46... Hey, Faith, you wanna play jacks? Hope, you're making me lose count. - And people say twins think alike. - Forty-seven, 48. Hope, where you going? To meet Tory. Please don't tell. Cade... ...you wouldn't have any idea where Hope's got herself to, would you? She's hiding in my closet. Some dumb game she's playing. Oh, well, somebody has a ballet lesson she needs to be well rested for. And it's almost 7:30. Faith? Did you see the new toothbrush I bought you? You are the best brother in the world. Can I go with you? Why would you want to? Cade and Tory sitting in a tree I hate you. K- l-S-S-l-N-G First comes love Then comes marriage Then comes the baby In the baby carriage Password? Password? Tory? It's okay if you can't remember the password. Just come out, okay? - Tory. - No. No. - Go away. - Run. Tory. In the spring before that summer... ... we used Hope's pocket knife to cut a narrow slice in our wrists. Solemnly we mixed our blood. We were lucky we didn't end up with lockjaw. Instead we became sisters. Ever since that terrible August, I have missed Hope. As I missed the part of me that died with her. The day my father took us away... ... a week after Hope was put in the ground... ... I had no idea that it would be 18 years before I'd come home again. Funny how in the pictures there was a plant... ...right in front of that crack in the window. You bet you'll be right down here to take care of it. Thank you. - Hi. Don't kill your favorite cousin. - Wade, I'm so happy to see you. I can't believe it's been three years. I kept meaning to come to New York and visit... ...but, you know, I opened my own practice and all. Just tell me that this place is totally beautiful... ...and I am gonna be a huge success and I'll forgive you for anything. Yeah, it's terrific. Just one little question. In God's name, why? God's name why, what? You know perfectly well in God's name why, what. Make yourself useful. This whole area's booming. All those new families who are dying to fill their houses... ...with high-end, handcrafted housewares... ...that I am here to sell them. There's a thousand cute, booming, yuppified towns in the state. Why here? Why go chasing restless ghosts and bad memories? It turns out that restless ghosts and bad memories... ...know their way to every town I've ever run away to. But I can't keep running. I can not keep letting them win. Well, you know, it's not just the ghosts. You should hear the living. You know who's opening that new store on Main Street? The girl whose daddy killed Hope Lavelle and got away with it. Which may or may not be true. What's true is that he's a hundred miles up the interstate... ...and just as piss-mean as ever. And on work furlough for hitting that cop... ...and has to punch in every morning or back to prison. Yeah, every morning until the one morning he decides not to. He can't hurt me now. He can't hurt me ever again. And that's why I came home. So I'd finally believe that. Come and stay with me until you find a place. - I found a place. I'm renting the cabin. - The cabin? The leasing agents said the Lavelles fixed it up. - No, Tory. Not out there, where... - Wade, it's what I need to do. I'm not going to change my mind. Oh, now. Now this you are not gonna believe. Tory, I'd like you to meet a fine local contractor who also happens to be... ...the recently-elected mayor of Progress, North Carolina... ...Dwight Collier. It's good to see you, Tory. Dwight? You mean Dwight the dw... Go ahead and say it. Dweeb is a badge of honor I wear with pride. Hell I suffered at your cousin's hands was the best thing that happened. It got me running 10 miles a day. Sneaking into the gym every night. Doing everything to break the curse. Ten miles a day, hell. Once a dweeb always a dweeb. And look what all that hard work got me. That cannot be Tory Bodeen. - You're Lissy Harlowe. - Lissy Harlowe Collier. Never was the same around here without you. And how are your sweet old mom and dad doing? You know, Tory's had a long drive and I gotta get her something to eat. So we'll see you guys later. Welcome home, Tory. Tory, get that box. Tory... ...you've gotta see this. His belly looks like fire. Cade. Cade, come here. Just a sec. You'd better go. Tory, get in the car. Tory? You here? Cade? Well. Kincaid Anthony Lavelle, to be exact. Wanted to stop by, see if you needed anything. I'm fine. Everybody's talking about the new store opening on Main Street. Well, talk is good considering the size of my advertising budget. You grew into your eyes. When I was 12, they used to scare me. When you were 12 you were too busy running around like a monkey... ...with my cousin and Dwight to notice me. Well, there was a space of time when I noticed everything about you. Still carry that picture of you around in my head of you and Hope. - Is there something you want? - Is that what you think? Everybody wants something. I have about three months work to do in three weeks. I should get started. Well, you just let me know if there's any problems with the cabin. Your sister's home. Home-for-a-visit home or home home? Well, that was fast. We'll have dinner. Hello? Cade. Make me a whiskey and soda. Hold the soda. Welcome home, Faith. You know what the problem marrying a country western singer is? All those pretty songs put a tear in your eye, all that: I cheated on you, darling But I love you You're the best friend I got Besides my bottle Well, it all turns out to be non-fiction. Cade. - That was Lissy Collier on the phone. - Well, what took her so long? Please tell me that we're not going to rent the cabin to her. To Lissy Collier? - Lissy's moving out on Dwight? - To Victoria Bodeen. She's opening some kind of a store on Main Street. She's not gonna be trouble to you. No. No trouble at all. Except every time I walk down Main Street I have to see her face. She was 10 years old. Old enough to run away and save her own skin. And old enough to protect the person she saw doing it. - She wasn't there. - Oh, so you subscribe... ...to the My Favorite Martian version of the story? She was able to tell us exactly where the body was... ...because she picked it up on her antenna. I don't care what alibi the police chose to swallow. Her father raped and murdered your sister... ...and threw her away like a broken doll. And I can't believe that you would allow her to live on our property. Ma. And why did she have to turn up in August, of all months? Put your bags away, Faith. What the hell is Tory Bodeen doing back here? Well, darling, a person could ask the same thing about you. I'll studiously ignore that. Why did great-granddaddy have to build this gloomy old castle... ...instead of a nice white plantation like everybody else? And why is it I can't wait to get back home... ...then 10 minutes after I'm here... ...I feel like the life is being strangled out of me? You'll find the nightlife in Progress hasn't improved much since you left. Well, now, that's about to change then, isn't it? You tell Robbie to give you two of these pills twice a day... ...and if he forgets you call me up so I can give him a what-for. You think he heard me? - Thank you, Dr. Mooney. - There you go. See you, Robbie. You really should look into the lock on that back door. You're a married woman. Well, then... ...how about I read some magazines... ...while you wait for the annulment papers to go through? Faith... ...don't do this to me again. - Oh, now look at this. There's a whole new frontier opening up... ...in homeopathic care for household pets. Take it off. She never liked me. She never said boo to me. Just stared at me with those spooky eyes... ...like she knew just what I was thinking. She had plenty to say to Hope though... ...until I came along, then she'd clam right up. What does she wanna move back into the old place for? Probably as crazy as people used to say. No, she's not crazy. She's lonely. And sometimes lonely people come home... ...because there's no other place to go. You know, maybe tomorrow night... ...we can park under those big old oak trees. No, I don't know what my plans are for tomorrow. I've gotta get going. It's my first night home and all. What? What? I'll call you tomorrow. Tory. Tory, wake up. I'm glad you came back, Tory. I didn't come that night. I guess you weren't suppose to, but you're supposed to be here now... ...because there are more and there's gonna be more until you stop it. Until I stop what? You have to be careful and you have to be smart. Tory Bodeen, girl spy. Hope, that's not why I came back. I came back so I could stop being so afraid. There's only 18 more days. Until the 23rd, the anniversary? - I know that, but I really... - You have to wake up now. Something's coming. You did the right thing calling the cops. If you hear another prowler out by your place, you be sure and dial 911. The boys will be there before you hit the second one. Thanks. Dwight... ...after Hope... ...were there any more incidents like that? No. He never struck again. Not around these parts anyway. Certainly left his mark, though. August 23rd is never a very happy day around here. Cade came by. He seems the same. The Prince of Progress through and through. Never a hope he'll let you forget it. He must have his fair share of prospective princesses, huh? That man has left a trail of broken female hearts... ...that would make the devil weep with sorrow. I'll call you with an estimate. I really appreciate this. The lard-ass dweeb and the girl from the wrong side of the tracks. Us outsiders have gotta stick together. Bye. Oh, I'm sorry. We're not open. Sure aren't very friendly to a potential customer. Just like Hope, all grown up, huh? Sorry, wrong virtue. I'm Faith. Oh, very nice. Very nice. Now that's something I couldn't even find in Charlotte. The cabin's awfully rustic for someone of your sophisticated taste. But, then, I suppose you never needed much. That's the difference between you and me. You never needed much. And I always needed everything. - Did you ever get it? - Still collecting. So I take it you believe in second chances. Yes, I do. It only works if you're lucky not to give a damn about things... ...like guilt and consequences. - Are you lucky? I travel light and I travel often. So do I. Looks like we landed in the same place this time. No reason that should be a problem. As long as you remember who got here first. It's hard on my mother, you being back here. Don't make it any harder. I'm wondering if I could get that picture for the Star Register? Sorry, I'm really not put together right now. That's how we want it, real natural. Like that. I missed you over at work this morning. Don't parole officers ever sleep a little late? I'm gonna piss test you, Han. What? You think I'd risk testing dirty with nine years... ...in that place hanging over me? With you, I never know what to think. Just go behind there. - You forgot your magic bracelets. - What? Wonder Woman can't work wonders without her bracelets. - I'll get this end. - No, it's all right. I don't need help. - Well, we all need help. - I can handle it. And you're almost contrary enough for me to let you. However, I am trapped by my superior breeding. - Oh, man. What kind of bed is this? - Iron. Why? Did you forget your cape, Superman? Or should I just call you Mr. Kent? - So when are you gonna ask me? - Ask what? How I knew where to find her? How I knew what happened. Well, I don't have to. - Well, some people think that l... - Not me. If you believe I'm possessed of unnatural powers aren't you afraid... ...that I'm gonna dig up your dark secrets... ...and sell them to your enemies? Or do you expect stock tips? Because I don't do the future, just the present and the past. So are you gonna show off, tell me what I had for lunch today? Or are you gonna get your tool box? We can put this sucker together. I lost 25 pounds in two months. - Set it and... - Forget it. - That's all you have to... - You slide the food in... ... and it pops right out. I hope you had good times with that Irish setter you been running with. Because, pal, those days are about to be behind you. But it's all ahead of us, big boy. - Well, that's quite a dress. - Guess what I have on underneath it? It's not locked. Don't you like to live dangerously, Dr. Mooney? But... Oh, guess what I found? Oh, yeah. So how's Progress look after all these years? Same. - Here. - Thanks. Cade? Those detectives that your father hired after Hope died... ...did they ever come up with any leads? Zero. I'm glad I'm not the only one who still wants the answer. Is that what you came back here for? Yesterday, I would have said no, but now... I know you all think that my father did it. Your mama swore your dad never left the house that night. Oh, he could have done it. I saw inside his head more times than I wanted to. Ugly swirl of self-righteousness and blind hatred. But when I saw inside the person's head who did it, it was different. Blank. Like a TV after the station goes off. Nothing. Dwight's certainly changed. Yeah, well, sometimes I feel bad about the way we used to treat him. To be honest, if I'd known what a peacock he was gonna turn into... ...I would have treated him worse. Well, he got Lissy. Have to be justice enough for now. Do you wanna get some dinner later? - Dinner? - Nothing fancy. No tablecloths, no candles. Just, you know, pizza and a movie. I'm not that good with people. Tablecloths or not. You're opening a store. In a store, things are real simple. Okay. Well, now I shall graciously take my leave. My superior breeding in action once again. I really appreciate your help. A half a ham sandwich with Swiss and brown mustard. That's what you had for lunch. You gave the other half to that black dog... ...who always comes begging every time he sees you in the fields. Eight o'clock at O'Rourke's? And all I thought I was having for lunch today was a BLT and a soda. You know, baby, that old Collins place is for sale. I know it's a wreck, but, you know... Sure would be fun to restore it to its former glory. And with you cracking the whip over the work crew. What do you want, Faith? You want me to treat you like trash? Just like those deadbeats you left town chasing after? Half the time I haven't the faintest idea what you're talking about. I see your brother leaving, dressed in a more civilized manner. Where's he going? Somewhere dark and quiet where he can grope Tory Bodeen. If you don't spray the wheat, how do you kill the pests? The chemicals kill the pests, they also kill the good bugs... ...contaminate birds, get into the ground water. You spray today and a kid two towns over drinks it tomorrow. You're not in business for the money? Organic products command a premium in the marketplace. As I tried to tell my father... ...who lived to tell me I was destroying... ...what it took my ancestors 200 years to build. But not long enough to know he was wrong. Not wrong yet. I did not do that. Well, do you wanna not do that some more? - Cade. - What? You're insane. You're like 80 steps ahead of me. You can't just say let's go back to your place and... You didn't say that out loud, did you? That is why we're just meant to stay friendly neighbors. Apart from the fact that I may die of terminal embarrassment. - And that reason would be... - I know where this goes... ...and nobody close to me is ever safe. Whose business is it how safe or unsafe I'm interested in being? Tory, what you have is a great gift. It's a gift that's screwed up every job, relationship and home I've ever had. Dwight's delivering the cabinets at 7 a.m., I should get an early night. Stop. Stop, stop. Pull over. What do you see? Her girlfriend ditched her for some boy, so she's going to hitchhike. She thinks it's cool to get in some truck with some guy and drink whisky. - I hate this. I don't want this. - Let's go. Let's just get out of here. He takes her in there. She's crying. He's grunting and sweating and panting on top of her. Don't go in there. Don't go in there. I'm just gonna call the police. It's 12 years ago. And she was 16 years old. Her name was Alice but she didn't like that. So everybody just called her Ally. We need to call the police or the FBI. There's a reason that it reached out and got me like that. It was the same blank space. It's the same person who killed Hope. Oh, man. Mrs. Lavelle. Can I fix you a cup of coffee? I've had my coffee, thank you. Forgive me if I jump right in. I can't have you in this town. I know you know why that is. Yes, I know why that is. Mrs. Lavelle, I know there's a way... I can imagine the effort and expense you've put into setting up your store. I am willing to recompense you for everything you've spent... ...plus whatever it'll cost you to set up someplace else. I can write you a check for $25,000 now. And another 25 when you get wherever you go. - It certainly is a fair amount of money. - Well, I'm glad you think so. I'm not leaving. And where you got the idea that I would ever... ...for one second consider taking your money... It doesn't take much imagination. Your father cleared out for five grand. The only difference between you and him is you're a better negotiator. Forty thousand. Forty now... ...40 when you find a new place. I had nothing to do with what happened to Hope. And you didn't have anything to do with what happened in New York... ...when you killed that boy. What was his name? Josiah. No. Jonah. Jonah Mansfield. Think my detectives haven't watched every move... ...every member of your family has made in the last 18 years? Did you think you could hide from me? I wasn't hiding from you. I was hiding from my father. And I did not kill Jonah Mansfield. That is not what the police said. I want you to go now. Welcome home to Progress, Tory. I guess now we all just wait and see who dies next. It would just be part-time on the afternoons when I'm not teaching. Well, I haven't really thought about hiring. Not until I open the store and see how it's doing. It's not easy to run the place solo. No breaks, no time to do paperwork or check inventory. - Yes, but I really don't... - And I've sold everything... ...from tractors to tap dance lessons. And I just love the stuff you're selling here. I wanna steal every single piece of it. Oh, well, I mean, not that I would. - Do you have a rsum? - Rsum? Right here. And a dog, too. Guaranteed customer magnet. Hi, Mongo. See? One's coming in right now. Sherry, thank you. I'll give you a call. It was great to meet you. - Did you get a call back from the FBI? - He sent a fax. Her name's Alice Powell. They found her in those trees near the highway. And she was 16, just like you said. Tory, it happened August 23rd, 1995. That's six years later, to the day. It gets worse. It's part of a bigger file. Thirteen unsolved cases that fit the profile. All slim, all blonde. All raped and strangled on August the 23rd in different years... ...all over the country. Missouri, Ohio, Florida. And they're all different ages. A 14-year-old-girl, back in '94. A senior at Chapel Hill in '98. They're all the age that Hope would have been the year they died. He's killing her over and over again, once a year. And it's August the 10th. Listen, Tory... ...we might be able to help if you could let me tell my friend how you got this. No. There's nothing more that I can do. Please don't ask me that again. Just tell him that my father is a suspect and they should look into that. I'll go call him now. Are you gonna be all right? Yeah. Just have to keep busy. Who am I kidding? I've gotta get out of here. - I'm gonna go visit Hope. - You haven't been out there yet? No... ...but I wanna go now. Dinner later? Maybe this time we can make it all the way to the movies. Okay. I'm so sorry to intrude. I'm leaving. Screw being sorry. That was always the worst of you. Scared, "Please don't hate me," little mouse you always were. You like what my father did with the place? - It's beautiful. - Yeah. Either that or kind of creepy. I could never decide which. Takes courage to take something ugly and make it peaceful and beautiful. It takes courage to drink yourself to death in front of your family. - He lost a child. - I lost a sister. So did I. God, I don't know what I hate more, that you just said that... ...or that I know that it's true. She wanted to play jacks that night. But no, I was too busy brushing my hair. I always said no to her. God, no wonder she had to find another sister. I was supposed to meet her. I knew she was out in the woods alone. I didn't go. I should have played with her. You couldn't have known, Faith. I did. No. Oh, God. What? I just felt like we were just competing... ...in a game show, like American Idol or something. Trying to convince the judges who's the guiltiest? Yeah. Then the audience calls in with their votes... ...and the winner gets an all-expense paid trip for two to hell. - What are you doing? - There's someone there. What, is this one of your psychic things? - What are you...? Who's there? - I don't know. It's blank but he's coming that way. We've gotta run. - Run? To hell with running. - I don't know. Come on out, you chicken-assed son of a bitch. I think you need to take that magic radar in for a tune-up. - Here, just in case. - Oh, no, l... I got plenty more back home. Tory? I got a call from your mother. Your father beat up his parole officer to the tune of 62 stitches... ...and a wire in her jaw. - Oh, my God. And hasn't been heard from since. Why did she call you? - Scared. Running out of money. - Wade, she knows where he is. She's hiding him. The thought did cross my mind. I'm heading up there... ...and why I'd like your company. Get her to cough him up. Wade, the store's opening in five days and I really... It's just been so long since he's seen you. It might make all the difference. You didn't say she was coming. Hello, Mama. Always were right there on the scene when there was trouble. Now, don't talk that way, Aunt Sari. We're here to help. You wanna help, get that lying bitch parole officer to tell the truth. Slut got beat up by one of her boyfriends... ...now she's trying to pin it on my Han. Why don't we sit down? Tory, think you can make us some coffee? I got some instant left. Now, if Han's innocent, he needs to step forward and say that. The longer he stays on the run the worse it's gonna get for him. Do you think I wouldn't go to him if I knew where he was? I thought that maybe you'd remember a couple of places he'd go to cool off. Sleep off a night of drinking. Are you saying my Han's a drunk? The man works hard. He needs to relax sometimes. Jesus drank wine, didn't he? Everybody's wanting money. I went to the bank, but those sneaking liars took what we had in there. And then said how Han withdrew all the funds. Don't you worry about that, okay? - You can come stay with me. - I can't go anywhere. Man's got a right to expect his wife to be waiting... ...under the roof that he puts over her head. I can see the sky through the holes in your roof, Mama. Just like I could when I was little. Nothing was ever good enough for her. Why did she come? She turned her back on me a long time ago. You turned your back on me... ...the first time you stayed quiet while he beat me bloody. A thousand times I told you: "Don't set him off." You never learned. Is that how you were able to sleep at night... ...by telling yourself that? I ought to wring your devil eyes out of your head. - Aunt Sari. - Lf you or Dad raise your hand to me... ...you better pray you beat me dead this time. I'll be in the car. No. It's okay. I think she needs her boosters and her DPT. - What a sweetheart. - Oh, you do not even know. So can I walk in or do I need an appointment? You can walk in any time. Dr. Mooney's at your disposal. Great. Well, I better get back to work. Lissy would surely kill you for that little glance. Worth dying for. Speaking of the better half, it's Tupperware night. - Do you wanna get seriously drunk? - I can't. I made some tentative plans. Haven't you been making those plans... ...since you were 15? Aren't you tired of being penciled in? I should have killed you in high school when I had the chance. Excuse me. - Oh, really? - What do you think...? - Oh, my Lord. It is so beautiful. - Thank you. And so brave to choose a location where... How many is it now? Five, no six, new stores have crashed and burned. Oh, look at this little beauty. An artist outside of Charlotte makes those for me. I don't know if it's really me. Lissy, I am so impressed by you. How do you always manage to tighten that belt and live within your means? Actually, you know what? I think I'll take the necklace and the matching earrings... ...if you don't mind parting with them. - I will get you a box for these. You just paid my next month and a half's rent. Pain in the ass though he may be... ...I am, in fact, embarrassingly fond of my brother. Tory, I don't often see him smile. Let alone eight days before the 23rd of August. And then you come into town and half a dozen pizza dinners later... ...he can't seem to stop. Faith, Cade and I, we're just friends. Oh, yeah. Yeah. So you wanna come by after the opening? I'm not sure what my plans are yet, but I'll call you, okay? Okay. Let me take you out to celebrate. I think once this is over... ...all I'm gonna wanna do is crawl into bed. We could do that too, but dinner first might be nice. Here you are, Lissy. All wrapped up and ready to go. And just how drunk are you thinking of getting? There's Delmonico's and Winterhaven. Or that new place in Port Kingston. Yeah, Ptomaine Special. That's the talk. Well, there's always O'Rourke's. O'Rourke's, always a safe bet. We'd better get going. - Yeah, O'Rourke's. - Okay. I'll get my coat. - I'm sorry. - No, I'm sorry. - No, I'm sorry. - I was moving a little too fast. My head... ...it's like a multiplex. It's got all these movies playing at the same time. When I walk down the street, I get all these people... ...they're thinking, scheming and blaming coming at me. So you spend your life building up walls to keep it out. And then you meet someone that you wanna... You wanna be with... ...but you're too scared to take them down. Well, have you ever taken them down? Yeah. New York. I saw this picture on a milk carton... ...and I saw where the kid was on a beach in Florida. And the cop on the case, his name was Jack. We fell in love and we kept finding kids together. Well, that made him a star. And stars have groupies and he liked that. He liked that a lot. And I could see it in his head. And he hated me for it. And I freaked out. And I messed up with one of the kids and then I just ran... ...and I kept running. Well, let me tell you the difference between that guy and me. When that guy was growing up... ...he didn't wish you'd come home... ...every time he got the long end of the wishbone. Or blew his candles out on his birthday cake. Or saw the first star in the sky. And that's too bad for him... ...because he never got to see his wishes come true... ...better than he ever hoped. Just let your walls down, Tory. I'm letting mine down. Look at me. Look at me. Dr. Mooney? Wade? Tory, you have to wake up now. It's almost time for him to do it again. One week from tomorrow. He likes to hurt girls. It makes him feel important. Makes him feel like a man. Who is it, Hope? It's your turn now, Tory. He was watching us while we were making love. I saw more this time. He let his guard down. He was touching himself. For a split second I saw inside his head. I saw what he wanted that night. He wanted both of us, but he only got Hope. It's your father? I don't know. Maybe. But it's my turn. That's what Hope said. I'm the one that got away and now I'm back. - Lf you have any questions, just ask. - Okay, thanks. I'm gonna get you full-time protection. Dwight'll have cops go by any chance they get. Okay. Where is it? That's bad. Right where you can get it, every second. Who's the bitch you slept with last night? I swear, she means nothing to me. Don't you dare joke around about this. Where were you? I came by at 10... ...and I was here till 3 in the morning and you... You hung around waiting for me all that time? - I hate you. - I don't recall us having plans, Faith. - You don't like to make plans. - Wade, it was Saturday night. - You had to know I'd come by. - No, Faith. I don't know anything. You don't want me to know anything. I went out with Dwight. If I'd been with a woman, I'd have been free to do so. Same as you are. Isn't that the way you want it? I never said that. Well, you never said different. Well, I'm saying different now. Oh, well, you wanna change things. Oh, well, if that's the case... ...l'm gonna start adding my rules to the game. No more, "I'll let you know." We act like we give a damn about each other... ...or we walk away. I'm in love with you, Faith. Are you crazy? Don't say that. Yeah, I guess I shouldn't. Because every time I do, she seems to run away and marry somebody else. Oh, I do not. That's not true. Well, what do you want me to do? That's for you to figure out. I just know I'm not settling for crumbs anymore. And, meanwhile... ...your puppy needs to eat. - My puppy? No. - There's food in the kitchen. - No, I'm not taking her. Look at her. She loves you. No, Wade, I don't... No. She'll pee on my carpet and chew on my shoes. I've gotta shower. Wade, is this some kind of test? - Thank you. Come back. - We will. - Thank you, ladies. - You have skills, girl. Oh, stop. Oh, looks like Mongo caught us another customer. Welcome to Southern Comfort. Well, thank you for that. Hello, Tory. It's been a while. Sherry, this is my father. You must be so proud of your daughter and what she's done here. Hardly a day goes by I don't think of it and her. Sherry, why don't you run those pots down to the post office. Well, we still have an hour. Jane Biko is too important a customer for us to take any chances on. So... Yes, boss. It was very nice to meet you, Mr. Bodeen. You came back. What do you want? Back to where the shame of what you did... ...and what you were drove me from my home. Margaret Lavelle's money drove you from your home. Your new friends? Watching out for you while Daddy's on the loose? You smile and wave, Tory. I don't have much to lose. If they catch me I'm going to jail. The Lavelles paid me... ...to take from their sight the demon that brought death to their child. You will see hell for what you are. Is that how it works? Only get to go to heaven if you beat your little girl... ...and leave your wife to starve? I need money. Everything you got in there. Take it. Just take it. Come here. Look at me. You tell anybody I was here, I will come back... ...and do what I should have done the minute you were born. Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live... Tory. What are you doing? I'm sorry. I'm sorry. - I thought he came back. - Oh, my God. Were you robbed? - Did you call the police? - I don't need to call. - I need to clean myself up. - Are you crazy? It was my father. Who are you calling? Cade, then Dwight, then the police. He took the money, he's gone. I don't want you to call anybody. Guess what? You don't always get what you want. Come on, pick up. What's this? Watch the gun. This is Bee, as in Queen Bee. We were gonna drop $300 on a set of puppy bowls, weren't we, precious? Cade, wherever your butt is, get it down to Tory's store right this second. You're not spending one second alone or unguarded... ...until your father's behind bars. Not one second. Who's gonna guard you? Talk, Bee. Talk. Isn't Mama's Bee just the smartest puppy that ever lived? Oh, isn't Mama just the bestest... ...most responsible dog owner, ever, ever? Ever, ever? She ran onto the road right in front of me. I tried to swerve, but she just... Calm down. I know this dog. It belongs to the girl in Tory's store. Faith, I'm gonna need your help. Gentlemen, you have to be patient. Okay, girl, I'm gonna lay you down on the table. Good girl. Good girl. Oh, good. No broken ribs. Maybe a bruised kidney. The leg's the worst of it. Looks like a compound fracture. Okay, Faith, I need you to grab that towel... ...and press above where she's bleeding. Wade, are you gonna operate right now? We're gonna operate. She's got internal bleeding. When I need an instrument I'll describe it... ...and you give it to me handle first, okay? - Wade, I can't. - Faith. Faith, I'm all alone here. I need you, okay? You can do it. I know you can. - Okay. - Okay? Press right there. Yeah, right there. Good. Now, press it. Now hand me the hemostat. It's the one in the middle, the curved pair of scissors. All right. Thank you. It's okay. Here we go. You okay? No, I haven't seen her. Actually, I need her to come in. I left a couple messages. I was about to stop by her house. - Is Mongo okay? - Yeah, she will be. Sherry's probably looking for her I'm gonna meet you over there. Okay. Bye. Oh, my God, Wade. I had no idea what it was that you did. I thought it was all about giving out shots and cleaning up poop. - You just saved a life. - No, we saved a life. You were awesome. Would you just shut up and be my hero for one minute? And how steady his hands were. And blood was gushing out all over the place... ...and he never so much as flinched. He was just like George Clooney, only sexier. - The door's open. She must be home. - Don't. She's dead. What? Wait. We tell the police that we saw the door open and got a bad feeling, okay? - Why? - Just promise me. Okay. It's funny, knowing you as I do, I'd say you poked your head in that door. Curiosity, if nothing else. Well, obviously, you don't know me as well as you think. So you got a hunch there was a dead body there? - Yeah. - Well, I'm a big believer in hunches. Since the day, 18 years ago, when one of Tory's hunches... ...led us to where Hope Lavelle lay dead. That and those hunches you followed in New York City a few years back. I'm sorry, Tory, I know you wanted it secret. Didn't let on we knew. But we need your help. What happened in New York's got nothing to do with this. Three kids made it back home because you had hunches. And one didn't. But three did. That was one efficient killer we got working there. There's nothing left behind. No sign of what he used to tie her up. Left no fingerprints, no footprints in the road. I'd like you to go in with us, tell us what you see that we can't. What makes you think that I can help? Somebody's been planning this. They knew her dog, they knew how to get into her house. And I have been here the whole time and what good did I do? Hey. His name was Jonah Mansfield. I was so messed up over what was going on with the guy I got it wrong. I thought it was just one kidnapper. He died when the police went in. He was 7 years old. And Sherry Bellows was fine until she walked into my store. Look, hey, you did not kill Sherry Bellows. You did not kill Jonah Mansfield or Hope. The end of the story's always the same. Someone's dead and I'm running. Running where? Raleigh for tonight. Figure out how to close the store down and take it from there. Well, I'm going too. To the ends of the earth if that's where you're headed. So you can die trying to protect me? I'm not gonna let that happen. Tory. I'm saying goodbye. You have to let me go. She's in the kitchen. She's cooking dinner for her and Mongo. She turns the music on. She likes to have noise around her while she cooks. There's somebody else here. He's feeding Mongo. Drugging her. She turns. She's met him before. She doesn't understand. "Don't touch me," she says. "I'll do anything if you don't hurt me." She knows what he's going to do. Please don't touch me. He throws her. He throws her down on the bed and punches her hard. He ties her hands behind her back. He takes a condom out. She wants to be anywhere else but here. She can hear the music in the other room. It hurts. It hurts. He puts his hands around her neck and she can't fight anymore. Who is he? He's disappointed. He didn't want her. He wants somebody else. He drops it. He did leave something behind. He... It's... It's my father's hair. Sherry met him when he came into my store. If this was your father, this and Hope and the other... ...I can bring that to the FBI and they're gonna go straight to your mother. If I know Sari, anybody with a badge... ...comes knocking on her door she's gonna clam right up. If her own people get there first, you and Wade... I tried and she's not gonna talk to me. She hates me. It's different. He's wanted for murder. If she hides him, she's an accessory. Tory Bodeen and another dead body, what a surprise. It was awful. Give me a second to recover. Then you were there with her? What are you, best friends now? Don't you get tired of carrying this around every second of your life? I mean, you named your daughters Faith and Hope. Don't you have any of either of those things left? I fought as hard as I could for Jennifer and Jessica... ...but once your father got an idea in his head... Why don't you get out of this creepy old house? You have all the money in the world. You could... ...buy a villa in the south of France... ...and have a romance with a dashing Gypsy. So the answer to my problems is I should run around... ...sleeping with everything that moves, like you. Well, it's a way of life. It has its attractions. Ma, have you left Piedmont County since Hope died? Oh, my God, you haven't. Eighteen years. Tory. Hey. You can't go in there. Get back here. - Hey. You can't be in here. - It's her mother. - Get out. It's a crime scene. - It's her mother. Come on. Come on. Steady. Now, you wanna get his head right between those two notches. Now, give her a nice steady squeeze. Why do I feel more grief for Sherry Bellows... ...who I knew a couple of weeks, than I do for my mother? Well, you used up your grieving for Sari a long time ago. Squeeze, now. Don't pull. So you wanna get married or what? You gonna make me get down on one knee? With everything going on and I've only been back three weeks... ...that's not just crazy, that's just plain stupid. That's what they said about my great grandpa, Horace Vanderbilt Lavelle. He met a girl on one of the lifeboats of the SS Titanic. Proposed to her the day the rescue ship docked in New York a week later. They were married 71 years, had 11 children... ...and her name was on his lips the day that he died. You are not thinking straight. - I've gotta get ready for work. - Yeah, so do I. I'll have Faith come by here, tell her to bring her AK-47. She loves that little thing. Don't you ever wanna put your talents to use? Go to Vegas, hit the blackjack tables? It's not something to profit from, Faith. Oh, I forgot. This is the totally serious Miss Victoria Bodeen... ...we're talking about. "I am psychic, therefore I must suffer." Knowing my luck, I'd just get the dealer's childhood traumas. Faith, I left my hairclip in the car. Do you mind going to get that for me? - What's wrong? - Nothing. I just need my hairclip. Tory, I'm gonna have to give you lying lessons one day. What's going on? He's coming from the back. - Go out the front and run for your life. - No, come on. - Come with me. - No, then he'll get us both. Just go. Go. You lied. You told you saw me. There are more cops in this town... ...than mosquitoes. I don't have any money here. You don't ever get to lay a hand on me again. Mama didn't have enough money for you this time? Is that why you killed her? You're even crazier than I am. Now, put that down. Get your daddy some lemonade. We'll have us a family talk. - You never did have any balls. - No one's said that about me. I told you to go. I went to get my gun and call the police. Are you shot. Did he shoot you? No. What are you...? You shot him. Oh, thank God. Oh, my God. That's my car. I left the keys in it. Tory, get out of the road. Tory, Get out of the road. Tory, snap out of it. Oh, my God. Oh, God. Wade. I want my Wade. - Cade. - Are you okay? Are you guys okay? I heard the sirens, I saw the explosion. He's dead. I felt him die. Okay, let's get to the house. The police will wanna talk to you. Are you all right? I can still feel him. - He's watching. - No. No. Baby, that was just the echoes. He's dead. He's gone. It's over. Come on. It's okay, let's go. When do I get to actually feel like it's over? Like he isn't standing right behind me? Well, once we're clear of the 23rd. Just four more days. Yeah. When do I get to find out why you brought me here? Well, there hasn't been a lot of rain... ...but it's enough. And the soil holds more water when it isn't full of chemicals. My father had to water twice as much to fight the growth regulators... ...he sprayed on the stuff. That's how it was done. You do things differently, you have to prove yourself. How much do I have to prove to you, Tory? What are you talking about? Most people have treated you a certain way. It's all you know. I tried to do things differently. So I brought you here... ...to show you that I finish what I start. And what belongs to me it's everything that I've got. You make me so happy. Just the way everything is. Why do you have to change that? Well, that's a first... ...telling me that I make you happy. - It's so obvious. - Nothing's obvious to guys. Don't you know that? Tory... ...do you love me? Yes, but I think that l... That's not obvious enough. I need to hear it again. Do you love me? Yes, I love you. You wanna be with me? - Yes, but l... - Well, then come with me. I need to get something from home. You mean Beaux Reves? - I can't go there. - Of course you can. It's just a house. It's my house. Come on. I'm not allowed in the front rooms. Just the kitchen. Those are the rules. I'm sure once upon a time when you were barefoot... ...and covered in swamp mud those rules served a good purpose. Just hold on a second, okay? It's in my office. Catch. It was my grandmother's and it came to me. Cade, I need to talk with you. Come on down and we'll talk in the den. Just you and me. Well, then it'll have to wait. Wasn't "The guest is king"... ...always house rule number one within these halls? Not every girl whose pants you get into counts as a guest. - I'll be leaving now. - Please don't. The last I thought I'd hear from you is pure, low-down bad manners. I can't have her in this house. Oh, good, a party. Anybody care for a gin fizz? You're talking about the girl I'm to marry. What do you expect from me? - My blessings? - Yes, I would like that. I want your blessings more than I can say. But you don't need to keep doing this. The man who killed Hope is gone. I can't have this house fall into the hands of the girl... ...who left her to die. If you let that happen... ...l'll go to the board and have you fired from Lavelle Farms. And I'll fight it and I'll win. Not if Faith throws in her shares with me. And what makes you think that Faith is gonna do that? She's out of an inheritance if she doesn't. Actually, Faith doesn't need an inheritance anymore. Faith's got a job at Tory's store. She does? Yes, she does. Can we all stop talking about me in the third person, please? If you stand against me... ...I will leave this house. And we will have nothing more to say to each other. Would you stop being the outraged, confederate matriarch? They closed that show a long time ago. Mama, people go on from things. Even the death of a child. I pray to God you never have to find out how wrong you are about that. If I were God, you know what I'd answer? "Margaret, last time I checked, you had two other children... ...that have the distinction of still being alive." And two children who love you very much. Believe it or not. Mrs. Lavelle, please don't make him choose between us. I had another child who chose you. She paid a very high price. I should never have let her anywhere near you... ...or your family. Mama, you couldn't have stopped if you tried. I'll be going to the lake house. I'll send for my things. Cade, talk to her. Don't let her leave like that. I will. I'll talk to her when she's cooled down. I'm not gonna get through to her, though. Will she really leave? Yeah, if she does, it just might save her life. Not to mention mine. You know, Bee and I really need to mosey along. Don't we, precious? If you even think about letting Margaret Lavelle's lunacy... ...get in the way of even one-millionth of a molecule... ...of your happiness with Cade, I will personally kill you. Bye, now. I don't want a girlfriend. I wanna spend my life with you. I wanna have a family with you. Tory, will you marry me? Why does this scare me more than my father ever did? It's a yes or no question. Yes. She loved him, your grandmother. His name was Timothy and hers was Laura. And they were happy. With rain and sun coming in, it's hard to tell... ... what kind of August 23rd you're gonna have. So bring your sunscreen and your umbrella and you should be just fine. In Piedmont, "If you don't like the weather, just wait a minute. " So looking ahead at the next... Aunt Sari had a harder life than she needed... ...and a harder death than she deserved... ...but she's at peace now. I should have brought her flowers. I never bring her flowers here. I always go to the place in the woods. That was her place. I'm so sorry for your loss, Tory. If there's anything I can do, be sure to call. I will. Thank you. You know, Hope loved marigolds and they're growing crazy at Beaux Reves. Do you wanna pick some and meet me up there about 2? And we can tell her it's all over. Faith, I wish I felt that way. You will, you will in time. We all will. I can't believe I'm condescending to be friends with Tory Bodeen. I hope you know that I only pay $6.75 an hour... ...and there's no commission on sales. Well, I hope you know that I'm gonna kick such royal ass... ...that you'll be begging me to accept equal partnership by Christmas. - Lf you get there before me, don't... - I'll wait for you. Hello, Tory. Cade. We got the ballistics reports. The gun that killed Sari wasn't the one Bodeen had on him. Not even the same caliber. The one he had was reported stolen from a house... ...30 miles south of here between 7 and 8 p.m., Monday night. Sari's neighbors reported hearing gunshots at 7:30 p. M... ...a hundred miles north of here. Unless he sprouted wings and flew... - Yeah, well, the times must be wrong. - Who would have killed Tory's mom? The times aren't wrong. Look, if Bodeen didn't kill Sari, maybe he didn't kill any of them. Whoever did is still out there walking free. - You have any idea where Tory is? - Yes. She's with Hope. Faith's coming. She'll be here any second. No, she won't. I asked Lissy to drop in on her. And you know Lissy, when she gets to talking. Why'd you kill Hope? You were 12 years old. Cade or Wade. First at everything. First to get drunk, first to smoke a cigarette. I was gonna be the first to get a girl. Me, the fat kid, the sissy. I was gonna get two girls if I was lucky. Not that I'd be able to brag about it. Had to be my little secret. Kind of like being Batman. I didn't know I was gonna kill her. That just kind of happened. I drank some of my daddy's whisky, drank like a man, you know. "Come on, you fat slob, be a man. You can't be a man if you're a virgin." That night changed my life. That night was perfect. All those other girls, I was just trying to get that one perfect moment back. You were gone. Faith would have done, but the way her parents watched her... ...I couldn't get within 50 feet of her. I made do with tramps and losers. And when you came back... ...I was afraid you were gonna see what I was thinking. I knew how to fill my head with noise and block you out. You never got through. Standing next to you at Hope's funeral... ...wiping the sad, little tears from my eyes. Sherry, she wasn't part of the plan. But the way Cade had you surrounded 24l7... ...I had to get your guard down. I had to pin it on somebody else. And who better than Han? - And that just left... - My mother. What if she told the cops Han was with her at the time of the murder? I snuck there on Tuesday night, took a little hair out of your daddy's brush. Reason I couldn't see you is because there's nothing there. How about I show you a bit of that nothing? This is gonna be perfect. Tory Bodeen, girl spy, face to face with the forces of darkness. He's too strong. She can't keep fighting. He's strong, but she's smart. And everything she needs is right in front of her. Open your eyes, Tory. Thank God you're here. She went crazy. It's him. He killed Hope. He was here waiting for me. - You killed my sister? - No. She's insane. You knew Tory was here, standing with her and Faith at the cemetery. Don't you get it? It was her that killed Hope. She killed all of them. Why do you think there was never any evidence of a rape? It's because it wasn't a guy, it was her. Telling us where Hope's body was. Telling us it was her father's hair on the rug. I suspected her for a long time and she knew it. That's why she asked me to meet her out here. Carl, you gotta get me to a hospital. I'm gonna lose this eye. She was with me the night her mother died, the night Sherry was killed. He's gonna say that. He's had this obsession... ...since he was 10 years old. - He's lying, Carl. He tried to kill me. - Well, I got a man hurt here, Tory. To all appearances, you're holding the weapon. - She's telling you the truth, you son... - Now, you cool down. You hear me? Now, I need to get Dwight to a hospital, then I'll question them at the station. No. Then he's gonna ditch the gun that he killed my mother with. He let me in his head. I saw it. It's behind his back under his shirt. I mean, that's the whole point. This psychic thing, it's a con. How about you just lift the back of your shirt, we clear this up. I'm dying here. - Just search him. - You can't do that without a warrant. Well, you take that up with the judge, Dwight. Lift your shirt. Don't move. Senseless tragedy. Tory Bodeen shoots her boyfriend and the chief of police. Then she turns the gun on herself. How could a thing like that happen in a town like Progress? Dwight, don't move. It's coiled and it's gonna strike. I'm gonna kill you. I'm gonna kill you. Cade, no. Cade, no. No, stop. - No! - Stop. Don't do it. We're not him. We're not him, Cade. - We've got more coming, chief. - It's Collier. Get Collier. Mr. Collier, you have the right to remain silent. If you give up the right to remain silent... ...anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law. You have the right to speak to an attorney... It's over now, Hope, for real. Wade, when we get engaged, will you buy me a sapphire... ...instead of a diamond? And a nice one. Not too big or gaudy, mind you. Square cut. Are you proposing to me? Hell, no. No self-respecting Southern belle would lower herself to such a thing. Let's go home. Tory.
