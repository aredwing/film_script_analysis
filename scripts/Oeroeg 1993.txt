You enter a shack, some rice-eater by the door... So what happens? How should you do it? They're next to the door, so first? He won't be calling 'Mardeka' any more. Mardeka, sergeant!.. You put the stress wrong. The time has come, men. We're on our way to Indonesia. At first you will be dazed by new impressions and experiences. Yet you should stop and think why you are making this journey. Why you soldiers are heading for the tropics. The farm hands from Wolvega. The butcher's boy from Rotterdam. The student from Utrecht. A cross section of our people and all their lives. We come together several months ago. Civilians from all walks of life who reported to barracks. In the brief short time we have spent in transit barracks... ...the first changes have taken place. How do you spell 'Teun'? - Teun... T- E-... 'Rasa sayang, rasa sayang sayang ' 'Oh that girl is so far away' 'Rasa sayang' Can you see anything? I can't see anything at all. It can't be a water spirit, you can't see them. If you can't see it, how do you know it's the water spirit? You can't talk about spirits like that You'll make Neneh Kombel angry. Urug? I'm afraid. Don't do that, Johan! Neneh Kombel will get mad. I saw it. I saw it! I saw Neneh Kombel! That's impossible. Neneh Kombel is an ugly old woman. She lives in the trees. But I saw the spirit, with a beard. How do we go back now? Johan! Johan! - Urug! Dad! Look, there! Rescue them quickly! Rescue the children! Don't talk guna-guna nonsense, Deppoh. Go rescue them. You stay in your room all day, understood! Don't set a foot outside! That kampong boy has a bad influence on you. But Dad! - I don't want to hear another word. Don't play with the master's son or go to the big house any more! It gives you strange ideas. Yes, Dad, but... - I don't wan't to hear another word. T- A-P-E... - And that is? Very good! And? - R-I-C-E... And that is? - Rice! Good, and then? Mean! - Very good. If you take the T from tape, you get? Tape... Ape! Good. Write that down. If you leave the R off "Rice", you get? What was that? 'Near or far, we'll always be brothers. ' Johan, what are you doing? What did you say? 'Saya a looking at the bulan' I don't understand. You're a Dutchman, boy, speak Dutch! I'm looking at the moon, Dad. - Moon... Very good. Go to sleep. Sleep tight. Lieutenant... How did you know about Mer... - Merdeka. I was born there. - Really? I wonder what it'll be like? The finest country in the world. Nice people, delicious food... All kinds of fruit, satay... Pisang goreng... - Pisang what? That's fried banana. - They eat that? You will too, just wait. It won't be easy, because you don't get to enjoy the best... .. of that beautiful country. You will understand why you have to defend our colony. There was once a basis here... A basis of justice, peace and order. The Japanese invasion and their abuse... ...radically destroyed this basis. Police! Watch out, snipers! There! Up there! Indonesia merdeka! Finest country in the world! Fried banana! Pisang goreng! I hope we've arranged everything. You have somewhere to stay? I think I have written everything down. I wish you all the best, goodbye. Lida! - Johan. Hello. A lot has happened. Eight years is a long time. How long have you been out... ...of the concentration camp? - I was never in a camp. I thought the Japs interned everyone. - I kept out of their hands. I went into hiding. You look wonderful. I'm looking for father. Yes, he was here. Come with me. Good morning, Miss Banning. - The very man I was looking for. This is Johan ten Berghe. He was in Struiswijk Camp with your father. You're his son! My name is Van Amerongen, remember me? Uncle Chris! Come to our room. It will do Valerie good to see you. Do come. The Japs broke all of us. Your father has done what we can't. He's left Batavia. To go where? - We don't know. Probably back... What? To the plantation? To Kebon Jati? But that's much too dangerous! They say it's enemy territory. The TNI is in control. Your father return to Kebon Jati as soon as he was free. He talked about you so much recently. Valerie, look who's here. Johan... Hendrik's son! Why did you come back? Valerie, you can see... No, not just that... I wanted to see the East Indies again. This place? - Valerie, really... First the Japs, then the extremists with their Red & White! They want to get rid of us! She's confused. It's the camp and here... Where are we going? - Kebon Jati. Kebon Jati? - My father's there. The lieutenant has leave? - The lieutenant's taken leave. Stop here. WHAT ARE YOU DYING FOR, DUTCH SOLDIER? I say, Twan... I'll go on alone now. - Listen... if they ask where I am... I had to meet my father - I'm going too. I can't ask you that... We're not allowed any further. We're a team. I'm your driver, aren't I? Twan, just stay here. I'll skirt the lake up there. Cover me from here. Look... Hey, that's... That's the house on the photo! - Yes,that's Kebon Jati. If I'm not back in an hour, just go back. I can't do that! - Mortier, Do as you're told! Pisang gorng. - Pisang gorng. Halt! Hands up... Hurry! Hold that sten gun up! That way... Urug? Father! Johan! Nothing! Three cheers for the Queen! Deppoh! Do you like it? It suits you perfectly Real worsted. Good as new. You couldn't afford that in a lifetime. You're right, Mr Ten Berghe. You can go home. Today is a feast for you too. - Thank you, sir. Look, look! Can it walk over razorblades? ...equalised a little. - No car can survive otherwise. Nothing to be done I'm sorry. It'll take a week to get it repaired. What about the tea? Or are you changing to quinine? Valerie! - Thank you. No. Auction prices for tea are fine. The Queen! - The Queen! Why should I produce quinine? Excuse me... I say, Hendrik... Lida is a smart lady. When did she come to the Indies? - Long ago. She runs a lodging house. She teaches Johan twice a week. Look Urug, what a big one! That can fight! Put it down. - No, not with the slug! And this frog, what about that? - Just put it here. Look out, he's off! - He can't do that? Ouch! It pecks so creepily! Johan, don't get yourself dirty. Urug, go home. Miss Banning.. If Johan asks about his mother... ...then say she's ill... in Holland. You're the best dancer, Johan! Your son is a fine lad! Everybody! Let's go swimming. Where is Deppoh? Ali, call Deppoh. - Yes, master. Lay out some towels. Bring the car round. Get food and drink ready, Ali! Come swimming with us! Brilliant idea! But it's bewitched, Neneh Kombel! - Don't talk rubbish! But Urug says all kinds of spirits live there. Ask Deppoh! Deppoh! Deppoh! Deppoh! Behave yourself, Johan. Really! You dance well, Miss Banning. Neneh Kombel! It was a bat.. Little boys should be in bed. It's very slippery. Valerie... Is it far? How long can you stay under water? - Moment!... Valerie!... There he goes. I wouldn't do it. - Wait... wait... One, two, Go! - Is your watch running? Mind your words, Verbeek! This timepiece was a personal gift to my grandfather Jan... ...from the regent of Sumedang, Raden Adipati Surya Kusuma Adinata. It's a family heirloom. Is there a water spirit here? Is it safe to touch the water? There is no water-spirit. There are just water plants. If we dive in too deep... we can get tangled in the weeds... ...and drown. So there is no water-spirit? Neneh Kombel! Johan, behave yourself! Johan! Neneh Komb... No! No! Daddy, come back! Calm down, child. Calm down. Come on then... Calm down, Johan. Have a sip of water. Calm, yes... calm down... I'm glad you came. It's been three days. Boy, you're so feverish! Come on... Why is Urug crying, Dad? What happened? It was a bad dream... ...with a happy ending for you. Deppoh... Where's Deppoh? Deppoh rescued you from the water. He saved your life. But where's he now? Deppoh is... Deppoh is dead! Deppoh mati! Neneh Kombel did it! Stop this Neneh Kombel rubbish. You're Dutch! There's no Neneh Kombel. Deppoh got tangled in the weeds. It's no one's fault, Johan. It is, it's my fault. - It's no one's fault. Deppoh... Deppoh is a hero, a hero! Listen, Johan... Urug! Urug! Urug came to say goodbye. He's moving back to Darsala. We need the house for another mandur. Say goodbye to Urug. - Please, Johan! Johan, calm down! Here, have some water. Very good... Damn it! I'm sorry. You can stay at Kebon Jati. You can live with the servants. Forgive us, Dutch master, that we rebelled. And remember: simple Javans beg us to restore order. In that light we should see the sacrifice... Hendrik Ten Berghe made of his life. Dust to dust, ashes to ashes... Why didn't you shop him? You know your father. If I'd been 30 minutes earlier, he'd be alive. Near Kebon Jati I was threatened by his probable killer. I saw his eyes and part of his face. I'm almost sure it was Urug. - Urug loved your father. No, he loved you. I thought that... ...maybe you know where he is. He must be here somewhere. I saw him. I don't know where to look, Johan. Lida, I must find him. - I last saw him before the Japs came. He's in East Java, I hear. Dear Johan, when you were in Holland... ...things changed here. It's less simple. Lieutenant Ten Berghe! How should I save you from a court marshal? As far as I'm concerned they can have you. I thought... my father was in danger. I understand that, lieutenant. I think I can find his killer. It's police job to catch murderers, not the army's. Even if he's with the TNI? Tell me more. He might be able to help us. - If you can find him. I'll find him. I mean... alive! He's no use to us dead. I understand that, major. You realise I have to report to headquarters. Then it's up to Colonel Van Daalen. That's a pity. We're abandoning a trail and... ...he may pick it up.. ...and take the credit. Nice for the colonel... You speak the local lingo, don't you? That's right. Good. But only report back to me. I must be able to do it my way. No, thanks. You will, even if I forbid you. But you can't go alone. Take an experienced NCO with you. If you insist. - I do insist. Can I have some coffee? Shit! That thing's much too high! It's freezing. What am I doing here? Tin can... I don't stand in the WC and piss on the oor in your home! It isn't a bath, it's a mandi bak, okay? And hurry up. There's work to do. I'm coming. Mandi...? Good morning, sir. See you tomorrow. Two men there and two there. Make sure I'm not interrupted. If you want to know what I think... - We do it my way, sergeant. Agreed? One each side and one straight in - Everyone thinks you're crazy. Are you? Maybe. Is this for the army or for your father? It's for you, Twan. Turn that jeep! Is that chocolate? - No. Do you read me? Get lost! Off the jeep! What do you want here?! Satih? Sinyo Johan. Who are you carrying there? Your child? Is it a boy? What's his name? Deppoh. Sinyo Johan, it is dangerous for you to come here. Dangerous for you and for us. There's no one can be trusted anymore around here, Sinyo. You can trust me, Satih. I trust you. But some people around here... don't want to see the Dutch any more. They might think anything. You're a Dutch soldier now. They could draw their own conclusion. What's up with your mother? - She has malaria. But the neighbours have given her a herbal remedy Mum, Sinyo Johan is here. Sinyo have grown! How are you, Sinyo? - Is Urug here? We don't know where Urug is. Has he joined the TNI? Don't ask me that. I don't know. Does he know that his mother is very ill? You can have this picture of him. Thank you, Ibu... Has he changed much... .. in all these years? Why are you asking about him? Has he done anything wrong? Satih! Please leave, Sinyo. Satih, I must speak to Urug. He isn't here. If he's here he will only visit father's grave. It was no one's fault. It was an accident! You may have different recollection from ours. Lieutenant! Radio report from HQ! A large TNI column is approaching. They just crossed the Mandiri creek. Bruinsma, Bren on the last vehicle. Kretek, cover them. Are they far? A few miles south, they say. Great. - There's nothing great here! Where's that damn wog we want? He wasn't there. Bruinsma, take cover. Let's take some other blue apes! Sergeant! ...for protection. Get in! Sleep tight, bastard! No luck? He's here somewhere. Are you sure it was him? I will be if I find him. Can I ask you something? Not about that nurse! How do you say in Malay.. "Rita, you have the loveliest eyes I ever saw?" Brake, Twan! Brake! Duck! Wogs! Take cover! By the trees. - Where? Duck, Twan! Bruinsma, help me! What happened to him? Have mercy, sir. Why are you fighting? How many of you are there? You'd better tell me everything. Who is your commander? The name of your division? Tell me! Is that all? - He's well trained. Where's your command post? That damn propaganda station? Does he speak Dutch? Yes, but he won't. It's the "language of oppressors". You can go. You look exhausted. Anything else, major? - No thanks. Take some rest. Is there someone called Urug with your company? What did you ask him? What I asked him before. Someone should look at his wound. Join the army, rape a nanny... Late at night, without a fight.. The lieutenant stood guard, right? Twan? Are you awake? Can you hear me? It'll be all right. We're waiting for transport to Batavia They can help you there. Does it hurt? Miss... Help him! - I am. I'm no surgeon. I'm a nurse. I have done what I can. Can you give him an injection? We have no more morphine. R- i-t-a... beau-ti-ful eyes... What did he say? He says your eyes are like the sun, Miss Rita. Tell me everything. The name of your commander, your outpost. I'll take care of you. I'm listening! You don't want to talk? You want to be a hero? Will he live? - I don't know. Will the other casualty live? Is he a friend of yours? Yes Twan is my friend. Now you think it's your fault? You shouldn't be here. You aren't really a soldier. Goodnight. Nothing? Stop this at once! It's none of your business. Don't worry. We're just obeying orders. He's a prisoner of war. He's a wog. He almost killed your driver in an ambush. Whose side are you on? Let him go. You want us to let him go? At once! Let go! Thank you men. I shall have to report this. The major won't be happy. He wanted us to get the prisoner to talk. And you order us to kill him. I hope you hang for this! I just obeyed your order. William of Nassau, Dutch blood in my veins I trust in my fatherland till death A prince of Orange I am free and brave I have always honoured the King of Spain Where does the Rhine enter our country, boys? At Lobith, sir! - Very good! Here. Look, that's the Rhine. - No, that's the Mandiri! Groningen, Hoogezand, Sappemeer, Zuidbroek, Heiligerlee, Nieuweschans, Roodeschool... I'll y over them all later. Look, Dad. My report. Take the steps properly, Johan. One mark of 7.5, Very good! Very good, Johan. Urug has a report too. - I'll sign it too then. Ten for arithmetic, Urug?! That's not bad at all! You can be bookkeeper when Johan takes over the plantation. But Urug and I want to be explorer or pilot. Blow! - One, two, three. Very good... Come on. As far as the eye can see,boy... ...it'll all belong to you later. Beautiful, Urug. Did you make it yourself? Congratulations. There you are. - Thank you. Shall I show you. Look. Hi, Johan! Your birthday guests, Johan. But I didn't invite them! - Be a good host, come on! Congratulations! - Happy Birthday. It's time for him to mix with ordinary boys... ...and not hang around with Urug. Have you seen the kampong? Keep it that way! This is for you. Soldiers of Holland. Don't you wish you were back home in Purmerend? With your family, your wife, your fiancee. With your girl... But now you're thousands of miles from home. Your government misled you! You suffered German oppression. What does your government want? You have to oppress a people that wants freedom... The same freedom you craved for five years. You know this radio station is prohibited! They play such good music! - Next time, you'll be charged! Understood? And you'll be the first, Deelstra! Wait a minute. Twan, be good! I'll come and see you. Fried banana! Can you hear me? I won't hurt you. I need your help. This is personal. This man is an old friend. His name is Urug. He used to live in Kampong Darsalah... Is this the right time to interrogate someone? Did he tell you anything? What about soldier Mortier? Maybe they can save him. I don't know. - Rita... I had nothing to do with this. It was an accident, believe me. Of course. This is more your line, Ten Berghe. Than what, major? Intelligence work. You're not very clever, are you? Col. van Daalen just told me you sent a confidential report... ...on the prisoner straight to HQ. That's right. He said you asked for an inquiry into maltreatment of the prisoner. Maybe I can help you. What do you want? War is no excuse for lawlessness. Shall we leave it at that? We're fighting murderers, rapists, thugs! And you talk about justice? You're a bigger fool than I thought! Or are you remorseful, because you almost killed your driver? Sergeant, may I? I think you're hiding something lieutenant. What do you really want? Do you want to go home? Major, this is my home. Home is where you're loved... And who loves you here? Hi Urug! Want to join in? - Yes A real ballboy! Hey, hit it to me too! Fetch that ball! Hurry up! Hey you! You have bananas in your ears? Quick! What's the matter with your servant? Come here, you! He's getting away! After him! Good morning ladies. A letter for Mrs. Rooskens. Would you like more tea? Mr. van Blankestein. Here's your long-awaited letter. Paskil, tea. And this was for you. Johan! Shouldn't you be at school? Miss Lida? Is Urug less than us? What happened? Urug ran away from Kebon Jati. Where did he go? Of course Urug isn't less than us. Is a crocodile less than an elephant? A buttery less than a giraffe? No. They are different. Urug is your friend. That's all that counts. Who's she looking for? I don't know that lady. There's Urug. Urug! Urug, you can't skip school. Come with me. What did he say? - He said: 'I'm no longer at school. I'm a farmer now. ' Hold this. It's important that you learn, Urug. Then you can read and write and do arithmetic. Why? - For the future. What is 'future'? - Future is that when you grow up... ...you can do anything you like. - Anything? Pilot, admiral, doctor... - Admiral! Or be boss of the tea plantation! - No, I'll be boss of Kebon Jati. Listen. Johan's father is going to Europe soon. Johan will live with me too. - Great! What do you think of that? You never wear that any more. I'm no muslim. That tie... no good. Dad wants me to move back to Kebon Jati. That's better. What about me? Of course I won't go. I want to stay here. I'm a city boy now! Just like me. What's his new wife like? Let's not talk about it. Perfect. - Really? Keep it, it's an old one anyway. - Thanks. Hello, I'm Johan. This is Karin and this is Annelies. Hello. Would you like a cigarette or...? Good evening. Damn it! Lida's coming! The drink, quick! Hurry! Give me some money! But surely they aren't...? - Just give it, now! Hurry up and get lost! Jacket! Wait, wait! Going out again? Yes?! 'Look at the sparkle in my eyes' 'Look at my dimpled chin' Boys, really! - 'Don't be so silly!' 'Give us a smile. You look cross as a spider. ' You both have exams tomorrow! Urug, you have biology and Johan has geometry! 'Look at the sparkle in my eyes' 'Look at my dimpled chin' 'Now things are really looking up. ' 'Swallow your angry mood and grin!' I want to buy three. - No, sir. They're for the hospital. Oh okay, thanks anyway. Any news of Twan Mortier? - Not that I know of. You're working late. What are you doing? - We make juice from it. No smoking here. We used to draw faces on them. When my friend Twan was here... ...there was no morphine. But that sniper did get morphine, didn't he? I... found an ampoule somewhere. It was in there, I suppose? How long have you worked for the TNI? I'm a nurse! But on which side? Denounce me if you must. Or will you hang me in a tree? Who is that? That's my blood-brother. I think he killed my father. Now you want to kill him? - No... I only want to know what happened. I have to find him. You have contacts on the other side. Is that an order, lieutenant? No! But you have no choice. At ease. Sit down, gentlemen. I read your report with interest... ...and those by the major and sergeant. Appointing a complete commission to investigate... ...strike me as being too much of a good thing. And as officer responsible.. ...It would be most disagreeable... ...to see my subordinates squabbling in public. Especially when one of them, the young lieutenant... ...seems to be rather confused... ...by the tragic death of his father. It looks like this is a case of... ...an ambiguous order by you... ...and an unambiguous interpretation by the sergeant. That is quite common in times of war. I'll leave it at that. As far as you're concerned Ten Berghe... I think your considerable talents... ...would be better used at some training centres in Holland. So you will return to Holland on the next boat. Your new appointment also involves... ...automatic promotion to first lieutenant. Do I have any say in the matter? - I'm afraid not. It's an enviable position... Oh yes... That batman of yours... Twan Mortier... - Yes... I'm afraid he died last night. Will you visit his parents in Holland? Platoon 2, hut 5! Get out! All report to the quartermaster. Good evening... - Good evening. What is it? - I have to help you, sir. Who said so? Miss Rita said you needed help. Wait here. "There is much to talk about. " "Come to Telaga Hideung tomorrow. " "You know where!" "You will hear more there. " "You know where! You will hear more there. " "You're safe, on our word as blood brothers. Urug. " Architecture? But that means going back to Holland, doesn't it? I'm going to study medicine. They use too much magic, guna-guna and herb medicine around here. I'm going to improve matters. They're probably afraid I'll cut them open. Why? They trust you. You're one of them aren't you? Will you work for the government? I want to leave here. For Holland? America. To get rich! Everyone is equal there. Abdullah, how are you? - I'm fine. And you? Fine too. I have an exam tomorrow. Can we have two chicken satay? Tell your friend, I don't understand Dutch. Don't act crazy! - You're crazy! Two chicken satay, okay?! Are you deaf?! - Never mind. We'll get some elsewhere. You're the one blind! Go powder yourself white! Thank you. The man at the box office said... ...that my friend could come in for once. No, only Europeans. - I know, but... ...that there were odd exceptions. - No, no sir. Thank you. - Not even with...? Okay. Better luck next time. It won't work. Let's use the other entrance then. I don't really feel like it. Sir, you must go that way. - Yes, I know. Stupid Tarzan. If he learnt English with the apes, why not Dutch? ...or Malay. - Yes, or Malay. You go on your own - I won't go either. I want to write, buy some pens. I'll meet you later. We can have a beer at Tojo's. Hurry up, it'll be sold out. - Okay. See you later. Soldiers of Holland, awake! It's not too late to lay down your arms. Don't be misled. ...misused by powers in The Hague, who only want conquest... ...where there's nothing to conquer... ...because our Republic of Indonesia is a fact. ...Indonesia Merdeka! "Our Republic of Indonesia"?! Are you surprised, Johan? It's incredible. You were the picture of innocence at father's funeral, while... Innocence? What am I guilty of? I should have known. When you said you could hide... Where is Urug? What do you want of him? - Is he here. Let's make a deal first. Let's swap information. Johan, when will your offensive start? I don't know. - You're an officer! You did intelligence work! Lida, that was a special mission. I'm just an engineer. And I'm on my way back to Holland. Untie him. Sit down... Cigarette? You'd much rather stay here. I belong here in the Indies. Since 17 August 1945 this is no longer the "Indies"... ...but the Republic of Indonesia. - Yes... Led by collaborators... You have to take sides, Johan! Not everyone take the same side as you. What will you do? Lida, I don't have any information. I wouldn't tell you anyway. I'm no traitor. I just want to know where Urug is. It's a pity. Take him outside. We can't let you go, of course. You are now in the hands of the army of Republic of Indonesia. God preserve you, Johan. Stop it, men. Come on, let's go. We're pulling out! Experience has taught me that many fellow natives... ...are infected with an aggressive virus... ...and now suffer eye trouble. So they can't see what is happening around them. Every day! A fatal disease resulting in bad eye-hand coordination... ...and limiting flexion of the fingers... The hand only has one position. This one! Indonesia merdeka! While we all know that training these flexors... ...makes the fingers able to curl completely! Beautiful speech. Thank you. Congratulations. A school diploma opens the doors to the world... for some! Hello Johan. We haven't seen you for a long time. I leave by boat tomorrow. I came to say goodbye. You'll miss Urug's speech at the university. What a pity. She speaks good Malay and is learning Javan. To help Urug working among the people. You want to join government service? Not the government! I don't need your help any more. You hold up your hand to Lida. Lida thinks the way we do. One of the few. 'The Rhine enters Holland at Lobith. ' But the Ciliwung has its source at Gunung Gde spring. That we didn't learn! 'If you can sing, sing along'. That's what the government wants. But every bird sings its own song. 'William of Nassau' 'Indonesian blood run in my veins' 'Loyal to Sukarno' 'We are until death' But when our people want to sing of this freedom... ...they were arrested and exiled. We have been exploited for centuries. The government humiliated and underpaid the people. It's not that bad, Urug, is it? Look at your father. He was a mandur. How dare you mention my father! Can we change the... - No... I have no secrets for my friends. They can hear it all. Why has everything changed? - Changed? You'll never understand, Johan! What do you mean? God, we were happy with your discarded clothes! "Too small, too big, hardly worn!" I never gave you my clothes which were too small! I don't understand. Who's going to study in Holland? Who can't watch Tarzan from the front? I apologised a thousand times. Forgive me that! Forgive and forget! And for my father? No Johan, not any more. Your father has nothing to do with this. He has everything to do with this! You're father should be dead, not mine! You killed my father! But he saved my life! Without Deppoh I would have drowned. Why didn't your father jump in and save you? Because he can't swim. - You believe that? Yes, Dad can't swim. "Deppoh, jump in or I'll get my nice suit wet. " Go back to your own country... And never come back! Never! Bye Johan, have a good journey. The finest time of your life, Johan! Study, drinking, women. There are good women and bad ones. Watch out for the bad ones. Good luck! Dad? Is there a swimming pool on board? Of course! Are you sure? - Of course I'm sure. How come? - I swam every day on my honeymoon. Have a good voyage. Lieutenant Johan ten Berghe? 3rd company, infantry battalion. 7 December division? Captain Sudiarta... Commander of the TNI troops, Siliwangi Division. The past pursues me. An eye for an eye... Between who? Between me and him. Between father and Urug. Father forced Deppoh to save me, didn't he? You were there. Would you watch your own son drown? Would you? So what happened? Deppoh drowned. Hendrik dived in after you fell. You were dragged out, then.. Hendrik didn't have to order Deppoh. The order was in Deppoh's blood. He dived in to get his master's watch. When we found him, we decided that Deppoh died a hero. And that we would never tell the true story. Why not? Shame. The nobler his deed, the deeper we buried our shame. So father was paid back in kind. Why Lida? Why didn't you shop him? Your father didn't kill Deppoh... ...and Urug didn't kill your father. I saw him by the lake. On the day father was killed. It can't have been him, Johan. He was taken prisoner 6 months ago. He's in jail in Bandung. What will happen to me? Attention! Urug? Johan. Keep walking! Are we still friends? Only if we are equals. Aren't we equals now? Keep walking! Not if 12 Indonesians worth as much as you. Ten Berghe! Lieutenant! Urug! Here. Take care of it. Be safe... 'Near or far, we will always be brothers. ' Right! IT TOOK 2 MORE YEARS OF BATTLE AND TALKS BEFORE HOLLAND... ...RECOGNIZED INDEPENDENCE OF ITS FORMER COLONY IN 27 DECEMBER 1949.
