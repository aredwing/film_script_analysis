Get along with ya, ya lazy devils. | I'll be layin' me whip on your backs. Chicago will not be movin'... and us living there for the rest | of our days, God willin'. I'll not be held back | by your tongue. A fine city waiting there | just over the rim of the land. "I'll rest there tonight," | I said to myself. And so I will. | 'Tis a mighty city will be built here. The hub. Yes, the hub | of the country... fillin' all | this prairie land... and you boys | living to see it. Huh, indeed. Come on. | Get along with ya. Look, Pa. | It's a train. Come on, Pa. | Let's race her. By the twinklin' stars | of heaven, I will. - Come on, boys. | - You'll do no such. Go on, Pa! | You can lick it! We're licking it! | We're licking it! Whoa! Whoa there! Hold on, boys! | Whoa, boy. Whoa there. Whoa! Whoa, boy. Holy Mary, Mother of God. - Pat. Pat! | - Pa. Pat. Jack, | fix the water, quick. Dion, my petticoat, | tear it. - Ma. | - Shh! Dion, take off your coat | and put it under his head. - Is he hurt bad? | - How should I be knowin'? Pour a little water over his head. That's enough. | Dion, get the whiskey. Never mind me. | Are the rest unharmed? - Not a scratch. | - Heaven be praised for that. 'Twas me own fault | and no other. Ain't it the devil's | own doin', though... to be draggin' me down and then | bumping the life out of me? Just when the smell | of Chicago's in me nose. Jack. Dion. Bob. Come closer here, | the three of ya... and mind what | I have to say. 'Tis a grand new place, | this Chicago. And them that grow with it | will be rich and strong... like I was always | minded to be. 'Tis a boom, | and you'll boom with it. Someday you'll be | fine, big men... a credit to me name... and everybody speakin' | with respect of the O'Learys... and how they grew up with the city | and put their mark on it. You're wastin' yourself, Patrick. | You with your fine talk. It's me last breath I'm usin', | and I'll have me say. - Help me put him in the wagon. We've got to find a doctor. | - No. No, it's no use. Just bury me here... and let Chicago | come to me... that couldn't come to it. Molly... Patrick. - Patrick. | - Ma! Holy Mary, Mother of God, | help my Pat rest in peace... him that was so restless on Earth, | for he was a good man... for all his fine | ambitions. And if there ever was to be food | to be got or shelter... or you wanted someone to laugh with | or have a bit of a good time... you didn't have to look | any further than Patrick O'Leary. But I need not | be tellin' you all this... who know it better | than I do. Amen. Get the horses ready, | boys. Good-bye, Pat. Someday, I'll be | sendin' the priest... to speak | the proper words. Ma, I'll | take care of ya. I'll do what he said. | You know, about Chicago and... Sure, Ma, we'll | take care of ya. I'm gonna make a lot of money | and get ya things and... Hush it, | the both of you. Get in the wagon. Giddap. Ho! Ma, we've gotta find | someplace to stay. - We can't keep on living in a wagon. | - Time enough for that. - It's a job I'm looking for first. | - Look! There's a theater. Maybe I could get | to be an actor. You an actor, and your father | not cold in his grave. - But we've gotta do something. | - It's school you'll be going to, the three of ya. School, at my age. Whoa. Look. Right under | my very eyes. Wait here. I won't be a minute away. And keep your eyes | off this picture... - and her in tights or worse. | - All right, Ma. Gee! Look at them horses. Ain't they beauts? - Look. They're stuck. | - Yeah, in the mud. Young man. | I mean you. Could I bother you to assist | us ladies to the sidewalk? I'm sorry, ma'am, but I got on | my new store-bought pants. Whoa, boy! Whoa, whoa! Ladies, if me and my brother here can | make a saddle, maybe we could get you out. - Saddle? | - Yes'm, like this. All you gotta do | is hold on. Why, that's marvelous. | Ada, you try it. That's gonna be grand. | Now mind your dress. Dion.! Jack.! - Up to The Hub. | - We just slipped. You little brats! - I'll... I'll... | - And who will you be hittin'? - Look at me! | - A bit of mud, and it behind. A pair of tender hands and plenty of soap, | it'll be as good as new. You don't know what | you're talking about! There's not a washerwoman | in this town that could save this dress. Is that so now? And what | would you say if I told you... that I could do it myself, | if it was worth me time? All right. You're so smart. | You save this dress, and I'll give you... I'll be namin' the price, and you | providin' the soap and the tub. Hey, Ma.! Ma, I'm back.! I got three from Gil Warren | and two from Mrs. Palmer. - She says a pair of her whatchamacallems are missing. | - Oh, she did? You can tell the fine lady she'll get 'em | back when she pays for the soap she owes. - Yes'm. | - And put up the horse. Give her some oats. And be sure | the barn door's fastened. And then get your hands and face | washed before it's supper. Yes'm. Gretchen. Ja? - Look out! | - The milk! - It's gone! | - Oh, it's all right. No use crying over it now. | It's spilt. She might've kicked you. I told you never to milk her without | putting that bar between her legs. That's what it's for. | Daisy, you hussy! Mrs. O'Leary! | What will she say? - Oh, that's all right. I'll fix it with Ma. | - Ja? Ja. Aw, gee. Ja. Gut. - Thank you, Daisy. | - Ma.! Ma.! - Out here, Jack. | - I thought you were coming down to court to hear me. With all Chicago waitin' to be washed? | Get along with ya. - Where'd I get the time? | - I sure made 'em sit up and take notice. - Did you now? | - I told 'em just what I thought about 'em. "My client is right," | I said, "and you know it. But what do you care about people, | as long as you can fill your pockets?" No wonder they say this is the worst city, | with politicians like Gil Warren running things. - And how did the fine gentleman like that? | - Oh, he was sweatin' plenty. - "Sure," I said. "What do you care about Chicago being bad... | - Take the handle. "as long as business is good and you've | got all the beef and pork in the world? "But I'll tell you this. It takes more than | those things to make this a great city. "It takes people with | some sense of decency... to make this not only the biggest city | in the world, but the best. " It's a fine silver | tongue you ha'... and your father would be | that proud of you. And I told him... Here you are! Well, good-bye, boys. | Don't let 'em keep you too long. If you see my old lady, tell her I'm sitting | up with a friend that was took sick. Have a cigar, Jim. Thanks for the ride. | I'll do the same for you. Thanks, lad. Anytime you're | coming our way, let us know. - We'll be glad to have you with us. | - I'll remember that. Watch the mud on your shoes, | Pickle. You know Ma. Hey, Ma! It's me! - Hello, Ma! | - Howdy, Mrs. O'Leary. - Hi, Jack. | - Hello, Pickle. - Sorry you lost your case, Jack. | - Lost? Sure. I, uh... I forgot to tell you. | The judge dismissed it. Heaven help me. And all the time | I thought he'd won it. Don't worry. Warren won't | hold it against you, as long as you lost. I heard about it. A fella said Jack | had the courtroom hypnotized. Yeah, everybody | but the judge. Had him too, only Gil Warren | put him on the bench. Keep your hand | away from that. But, Ma, it's just | the right size. - Ma, for the last time, will you quit this laundry business? | - Why should I be quittin'? 'Cause I don't want my best girl | bending over a washtub all her life. - Go along with you now. | - I'll tell you what I'll do. I'll get you a new place, out of the Patch, | set you up like the finest hussy in town. Huh? Look. Look, Ma. - Where did you get that money? | - A fellow paid me. You're lyin'. You've been gambling | at that racetrack again. There wasn't | any gambling to it, Ma. There are only eight horses in the race... | mine and seven others. - All we had to do was shoot the other seven. | - Hmph! Huh, indeed. Come on, Ma. | How about it, hmm? - I'll not be livin' on money that isn't honestly got. | - Give us a kiss then, huh? - Now, Dion, get along with ya. I've got my work. Dion! | - Aw, come on. Won't wash out. Look at it. | I told that Gil Warren... I wouldn't wash any more tablecloths | they'd been drawing pictures on. - Send it back. | - Wait a minute. This looks like a map. Maybe Warren's gonna hunt | for a buried treasure. Hunt for it? He's already found it | in the city treasury. Something about | Randolph Street... and... and Madison. This looks like the tracks | for the horse car line. I know what it is. This means they're gonna run | the car line along Randolph Street. You're crazy. They've already surveyed | Madison for the tracks. Sure, they have. That's exactly what makes | me think they're gonna run along Randolph. - By golly, maybe you're right. | - Of course I'm right! That's the way they cheat the people... | get them to invest on Madison Street... and then switch the line | by their own property. - What an idea. | - You're right. This information is worth a fortune. - Ha! Listen to him. | - And I'm gonna get part of it. You with your fine talk | and your grand plans... not a penny ever honestly | earned to your name. Maybe so. But if I had | this corner here... where all the traffic meets, | I'd put up the biggest saloon in town. - Saloon? | - And free beers to you, Mrs. O'Leary. I wouldn't be stepping | my foot inside. Then I guess we'll have to keep on | rushing the growler for you. Oh, but look. There's a name already scribbled | in right on my corner. B- F-A-W-C-E-double "T." - B. Fawcett. | - Ever heard of him? No. It's a new one on me. - Stop it! Stop it! Are you out of your mind? | - I've gotta have this name. We'll go down to Gil Warren's and see what | we can find out about this Fawcett fellow. - You've ruined it! | - There was already a hole in it, Mrs. O'Leary. The scamp. Hello, Rondo. - Where's Mr. Warren? | - The other end of the bar. - Hello, Mr. Warren. | - Oh, hello, son. - Howdy, Mr. Warren. | - What can I do for you? - I'd like to talk to you for a moment. | - Sure. Go ahead. It's kind of private, and I thought that, uh... Not now. Not now. Little later, perhaps. Stick around. | Glad to have seen you. Whew! - What a woman. | - Yeah. Yeah, that's right. - Is she new? | - Yeah, she's new, new as far as Chicago's concerned. She was the biggest hit Niblo's Garden | in New York ever had. A sensation. | And I'm paying her a bigger price... than any entertainer | in this town ever got. - That's Belle Fawcett. | - Oh, Belle Fawcett. B. Fawcett? Ladies and gentlemen, | as an added treat tonight... the proceeds to go | to the widow and orphans... or our late bartender, | Aloysius O'Malley... who was shot in front | of this very door... my little girls are going to give a special | performance of our famous classic... Living Statues... an artistic divertissement straight | from New York and Paris, France. And remember, gentlemen... it's all for sweet charity, | and no tights. What am I bid? - One dollar. | - One dollar? Do I hear two? - Four dollars. | - Four, the gentleman says. - Who'll make it five? | - I'll pay five. Five. Now we're getting somewhere. | Who'll make it six? Speak right up, handsome. | What is it? Six? I'll pay $100 to charity | if Belle Fawcett plays Venus. We have a comedian | in the house. - Go ahead. Take his offer. | - Sold to handsome for $100. Come on. Let's see the color | of your money. Fifty, 70, 90, 100. Whiskey! Right through that door. I'll be | with you in a moment. Thank you. Hey, what's this? Wait a minute! Yes, Miss Fawcett. | Your carriage is here. Will you tell Mr. Warren I'll meet him | for lunch tomorrow at the Palmer House? - Yes, Miss Fawcett. | - Thank you. - Good night. | - Good night. - Oh! | - Get in.! Let me go! - Shut up! | - I won't! Let me out of here! - Shut up. | - Let me out of here, or I'll jump! Go ahead. Jump. Oh, it's you. | Driver! Driver! - No use yelling at him. I fixed him. | - Oh, you're crazy! Maybe. But I was sane | enough until tonight. Then I heard you sing, | and something happened to me. Something swept over me I've never | felt before or ever expect to feel again. - What are you talking about? | - I'm in love with you, Belle. - Get out, or I'll call the police! | - They can't stop me from loving you. Maybe not, but they can sure | cool you off, brother. I know it sounds crazy... | and I apologize... but it's true. Right now, my heart's pounding so. - Listen to it. Ow! | - Oh, you fool. I'm trembling all over. And I wanna be calm and cool | so I can make you understand. Say, are you | on the level? Absolutely. - But I don't even know who you are. | - Does that matter? It does to me. | And I'll tell you another thing. - I didn't like that cheap trick you pulled on me. | - I had to talk to you alone. What gave you the idea you could | make love to me like this? Just give me a chance. | I'll tell you the whole story. All right. You can stop here | and buy me a drink. No, not here. | It's too crowded. Since you've | taken me by storm... the least you might do is to take me | to your place so we can really talk. Very well, but your story | had better be good. All right, George. You can drive | to Miss Fawcett's home. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. - So this is where you live? | - Yes. Way up there | on the second floor. I think I can make it. Back to The Hub quick! Hey! Hey, wait a minute! Whew! What a woman. - Let's tell Ma. | - Ja. You want to? Do you reckon | she suspects? I was never that surprised | in all me life. All this hand-holdin' and goo-goo eyein' | and sighin' and gigglin'. I'm all wore out tryin' | to look the other way. - Aw, Ma. | - Now, I suppose you'll be tellin' me... you want | to get married. - Why, sure. | - You scamp. Takin' the best ironer I ever had. Well, if it's love | you're after... I guess a few shirts and tablecloths | can't stand in the way... but I won't have you sittin' around | and waitin' and not eatin'. You'll be gettin' married right away | and I want no back talk about it. Now, give me that pail. And I'd be ashamed, | with a fine spring moon outside... and you in a barn puttin' ideas | in the head of a temperamental cow. - So, you're in love at last. | - Sure, Mike... with you. And are you now? And I suppose it's | for me that you're slickin' your hair... anticipatin' yourself in front of a mirror | until it's half wore out. Well, you want me | to look nice, don't you? And I suppose you'll be holdin' | her hands, maybe stealin' a kiss... and her tellin' ya how grand ya are | and callin' ya pretty names. Here, let Ma do it. And you believin' her. That shirt! I thought so. Take it off. Oh, but, Ma, it's a beaut. | Look. "D.V.S."... Who's that? His name is Swift and he sells pigs. | Now take it off. - It needs to go back in the morning. | - Oh, come on, Ma! Take it off. | Take it off. Oh! Who's the best darn washer woman | in the whole bloomin' city of Chicago? Ma! Say, Ma! | I won my first case! - I knew you would! | - Congratulations. The jury wasn't out | more than 15 minutes... and the judge said it was the finest | speech he's heard all session. So did the lawyer from | the other side. And... yippee! Congratulations. I always | knew you had it in your tongue. A fellow from the Tribune | said he's gonna write it up. - You're gonna get your name in the paper? | - Yes! - How much did you get? | - Huh? - How much did you get? | - You did get paid for it, didn't you? The fellow only makes $10 a week, | and he's got a wife and a family. Ten dollars a week? | That's just $10 more than you make. - I couldn't take his money, could I? | - I give up. I've got one son that steals my laundry | and spends his money heaven knows where... another a lawyer and wins cases | and don't get paid for them. I should have brought the two of you up as | Irish bricklayers, and every Saturday payday. Don't mind her, as long as | she can keep her job. - Night, Ma. Don't sit up for me. I may be late. | - Hmm. Huh, indeed. Where's he going | all dressed up? Where is any of us going? | And where is it all going to end? For one thing, we can | be going in to supper. I wish you could have heard | what that judge said. - That you, Miss Belle? | - Yes. - Any messages for me? | - No. Nothing except a heap more flowers and | some champagne from that same gentleman. Lord, honey, you sure got | him snortin' in his sleep. I hope you threw them out. I throwed out the roses, but you knows | what a mess broken bottles make. Did you tell him not to come | around here anymore? I done told him that | till I'm black in the face. These corsets are so tight, | I can hardly breathe. As long as the men folks likes a small waist, | us gals has got to suffer. - You want anything else, Miss Belle? | - No, thank you, Hattie. - Good night. | - Good night. - You can call me early tomorrow afternoon. | - Yes'm. Get out of here. - Get out.! | - But listen... - Get out.! | - I'll tell you, I wanna... - Get out of here! | - Belle, I wanna talk to... - Get out.! | - Listen, Belle. Don't act like that. - What do you mean by breaking into my place? | - Don't be like that. - Don't act like that. I want to speak to you. | - Get out of here! - Get out of here! Hey! Help! Help! | - I want to speak to you. Hattie! Hattie! - You calling me, Miss Belle? | - Hattie.! Help! Let me... Police! Murder! Help! Police! Police! Hattie! Let me go! Oh, you! - Now, won't you tell me what this is all about? | - I love you, Belle. I mean, really. - Well... | - I want the truth. - You have a piece of property on Randolph Street. | - Of all the... I thought if you and I were | to put up a place like Warren's... only better, more class... | we could make a lot of money. But I really meant that | about being crazy about you. Why didn't you say so | in the first place? I'm a businesswoman. | I'd have listened to any proposition... without all | this foolishness. - You would've? | - Of course I would. What a woman. Right through this way, | Mr. Police.! Sorry, boss... but it looks like | the fire's out. Now, look, Senator. | Gil Warren controls... the Patch with | all its votes. You need votes. Now, | as long as Warren goes along... with no opposition, he has you and | your interests just where he wants them. Who knows, but the day | may come when Warren... gets other ideas | that'd be embarrassing. - We have an offer to make you. | - Now, I have the greatest... attraction that ever came to Chicago... | Miss Fawcett. Now with your backing | and your money to get us started... we'll open the greatest saloon | Chicago's ever known... on the busiest | corner in town... and I'll control the Patch... | I'll tell 'em how to vote. And what's more, Senator, | you see this floor? You see those real silver dollars | that Potter Palmer put in there? Well, every month | after we get started, Senator... they'll be 1,000 | of those for you. What do you say? | Are you in? I'm always in the market | for marketable goods. Go ahead. Full protection for me, | security for you and your family... and a hundred dollars in cash | every Monday from now on. Young man, | are you trying to bribe me? Why, Commissioner, | how can you say such a word? Mrs. Kelly, good evening. Welcome to | The Senate, and I hope you enjoy yourself. Good evening, sir. Good evening, | Mr. O'Shaughnessy. Welcome to The Senate. Hey, you mugs, where do you think you are? | Take off your hats. Keep on your coats | and shake hands with the boss. - Where do you think you're going? | - Now listen, shorty. You're taking | the wrong "altitude"... 'cause this is the only saloon | in town I ain't been thrown out of. I'll give you | just five minutes. I can do it in three. | That's tellin' him. - Captain Jamison. | - Captain Jamison, welcome. - And this is my daughter Ann. | - Miss Colby. - How do you do? | - How do you do? I've been begging Father | to bring me here for the opening. - I'm glad he did. | - It's marvelous. - I've never seen anything like it. | - Thank you. - May I show you to your table? | - Please do. Gentlemen, you give me The Senate, | I give you Chicago. Father says you're the smartest | young man in Chicago. That's because he knows | I'll deliver the Patch on Election Day. He says you have a great future, as big | as Gil Warren's if you do as he says. He's the boss, and one | of America's finest. - And now... I must change my costume. | - Allow me. I want to talk to you, my boy. | I have some great plans in store. Surely not tonight, Senator, when you have | so beautiful a daughter to entertain us. Father won't talk business | if I ask him not to. Will you, darling? I can't imagine the senator doing | anything that you asked him not to. That's right. She wraps me around | her finger all the time. Uh, excuse me, please. - I'll be right back. | - We'll expect you. He's nice-looking, isn't he? | I mean, for someone from the Patch. - Hello, Warren. | - Why, hello, son. - Mr. O'Leary. | - Jim-dandy place you've got here. - Thanks. | - Nothing like it in Chicago. I'm proud of you. - You mean, you're not sore? | - Why, no. I've come over to bury the hatchet. Live and let live... | that's my motto. - Come on. Have a drink. | - Matter of fact, I wanted a word in private with you. - Oh, sure. Come on in my office. | - See you in a minute, Rondo. Rondo, step up to the bar. | Anything you want, on the house. Thank you, Mr. O'Leary. - How old are you, son? | - Old enough to vote. Why? I was just thinking, | you've come along mighty fast. When I was your age, | do you know what I was doing? I was rounding up runaway slaves | and practically starving to death. - Sit down, Gil. | - Take it from me, times have changed. - Everything's youth today. | - Well, you seem to have done pretty well, Gil. I've managed, but you've got a great future | ahead of you. Mark my words. Well, I hope you're right. I don't blame you for taking Belle. | She's a great woman. I'd have married her if I'd had the chance, | but she never cared for me. - It was just a business deal, and you outbid me. | - What's on your mind? What would you say, son, if I told you | I was gonna close The Hub, quit? I'd say you were up to something. | What is it? I'm thinking of | running for mayor. Mayor? I've been electing them | long enough. Now I'm going to elect myself, | if you'll ride along with me. - How do I come in? | - You're a smart young fella. If you watch your step, you're going | to be a big power in this town. I could build a bigger place and give you | trouble, but I've had all I want of this. - You say the word, and I'm through. | - You close The Hub? Exactly, and give you | an open field. Now, we either work together | politically or fight it out. It's up to you. It's a nice place you have here, | but, like a tinder box... touch a match to it, and it'll go off | like a Roman candle. But what the devil? Chicago is big enough | for both of us and more. Together we could run | this town and run it right. You, Belle and me pulling together, | it'd be a lead pipe cinch. Yeah. Sounds all right. But naturally there's a little expense | involved, and right now with the... I took the liberty of bringing | my check for $10,000. There'll be more between now | and election time. I think we'll manage | very well, Your Honor. Now I could use that drink | you were talking about. Come on. Now, Belle, you've got to come | to my table right now... and have a bottle | of wine with me. I'd love to, but you'll have to | excuse me for one minute. Belle! Hello. I thought I | saw you come in here. I was just telling Dion | what a great place you've got. I never saw you | looking so beautiful. - I always did say she was the best looker Chicago ever saw. | - Thanks. Better watch yourself, son. | I'll get her back if I can. - But it looks like it won't be to The Hub. | - Gil's closing The Hub for good. Really? Why? There's the music for your song. | Better hurry. Dion'll tell you | all about it later. Whew! What a woman. Yes, that's exactly what | I said the first time I saw her. Remember? Oh, I'm... Miss Colby, | Miss Fawcett. - How do you do? | - How do you do? So sorry. You'll have to excuse Mr. O'Leary | another few minutes. I'll send him back. - That'll be very sweet of you. | - Thank you. - Is that the woman? | - Why, yes, I believe so. She's pretty... in a way. - Women like her have all the advantage, don't they? | - All except one. I wasn't thinking | of marriage. - So you're taking his money? | - What's the matter with his money? - The check's good, isn't it? | - You know how he feels about us, the threats he's made... I wouldn't worry about | that if I were you. Ever since I left his place, | he's schemed to get even. Now he's trying to do it | with your own help. - He knows that if he's mayor... | - What makes you think he's gonna be mayor? - But you took his money. | - Sure. Sure, and I'll vote for him | myself, if necessary... but I didn't say | how the Patch'll vote. - Why, that's... | - Politics. He'd knife me if he could, | and I simply mean to beat him to it. Why, you dirty dog. - You love me? | - Certainly not. Go on. Say it before | I break your back. Who was that little doll-faced blonde | you were smiling all over yourself about? Senator's daughter. | I have to be nice to him, don't I? Why weren't you breathing | down his neck? Stop it. You and The Senate | and Warren on the run. In other words, Mr. O'Leary | is rising in the world. Mr. O'Leary and present company. Chief, Mitch is here. Come on in | and shut the door. Is it true that you were caught | registering under a false name? Gee, chief, how was I to know | that guy was already registered? I told you this bozo | don't use his head. Oh, have a brain, you. Getting caught | with an election coming up... and that reform crowd | already yelling its head off. It would serve you right | if I let them send you to jail for life... but, no, I've got to sit through a trial | and figure a way to get you out. I oughta... | Oh, get out. Yeah! Come on out! Now, where were we? Oh, yes. - Good morning. | - Good morning. - Everything fixed? | - The district attorney said if you're worried... he'll let us have witnesses to prove | Mitch hasn't been in Chicago in two years. That's the kind | of prosecutor I like. - What'd you give him? | - The usual. Chief! It ain't fair! | It ain't fair! - It ain't fair! | - What's the matter? The district attorney... | and after we had him all fixed. - What are you talking about? | - Well, he fell down... and broke his ankle | and he ain't here! - The fool doesn't know how to walk? | - And the judge appointed... somebody to take his place | and I don't know who. - What's this mean? | - It means it ain't fixed. Oh, come on. In view of the unavoidable | detention of the district attorney... the court has appointed | a special counsel... a representative | of the Election Reform Committee... in the case of The City | of Chicago v. Edward Mitchell. Mr. O'Leary, are you | prepared to proceed? - We're ready, Your Honor. | - Oh, yes. - Is the defense ready? | - Uh, Your Honor... Your Honor, certain matters | have come up. New evidence have been uncovered | that compels me to... Go ahead with the trial. - Go ahead? | - Proceed. The defense is ready, | Your Honor. You may proceed, | Mr. O'Leary. Your Honor, it is no secret | that multiple voting... for years has been | a common practice... in that section of Chicago | known as the "Patch. " So common, it has come to be regarded | as one of the minor evils... in that district. Men who occupy the highest | offices in this city... openly and brazenly | bid against each other... for that very vote. Any mention of it is dismissed | with an indulgent smile... as something that | should not be talked about. There are men in this very courtroom, | Your Honor... who control every election | in this city... with such illegal votes. Men who sit in their | fine saloons... surrounded by every luxury | that money can buy... or that they can steal... while public officials bow and smile | before them and fight for their favor. Until today, nobody has ever obtained | sufficient evidence to convict them. Now, however, we have | an eyewitness... who was actually present | when the defendant, Edward Mitchell... was caught attempting to register | under four different names... The last time, as the beloved | Bishop Cornwall himself. You know, he's really good. - Some day he'll be a great lawyer. | - I think he's all right now. Mr. Clerk, call Carrie Donohue | to the stand. Carrie Donohue | take the stand. - She can't do this to me. | - Shh! Quiet! Stand up. Raise your | right hand. Do you swear to tell the truth, | the whole truth and nothing but the truth... - so help you God? What's your name? | - I do. - Carrie Donohue. | - Sit down. - Miss Donohue, you know this defendant? | - Do I know him? - Hmph! That big squirt. | - None of that now. - I'll haul off... | - Quiet! - Order in the court. | - Refrain from personal remarks. Tell the court what you know | about this man's registration. - Well, my gentleman friend's... | - Face the judge. hired to watch the registration | and I'm keeping him company... when this big squirt | walks in. - Well, he don't see me | and I don't say anything... but when he keeps comin' back, | I get suspicious... and I'm just about to tell my friend | that something funny's going on... when, sure enough, | back he comes again... and, this time, | he says he's a bishop. Well, that's too much even for me. Order in the court. - That's what you get for marrying 'em. | - You married to this woman? - What? | - Can you imagine it? - Ever divorce her? | - No! - Your Honor! May it please the court, | we ask that this woman's testimony... be stricken | from the records... and this case dismissed | on the grounds that the law says... a wife cannot testify | against her husband! - That woman is my client's lawful-wedded | spouse.! - Madam, is this true? - Well, I married him once, | if that's what you mean... - but I can tell you... | - That will do. - Well, I mean that he... | - That will do. Well. Hmph. Mr. O'Leary, | you distinctly told me... that you had had time to familiarize | yourself with all the facts in the case... and, yet, you take up this court's time | allowing your only witness... to testify, although | she's clearly unqualified. Your Honor, I assure you, this is | as much a surprise to me as it is to you. I ask the court's pardon. Case dismissed. - Tough break, kid. | - Yeah. - Congratulations. | - Aw, you can never tell about these women. They'll put it over on you every time, | if they can... but you were great yourself, | I was proud of you. Wait'll I go after the big fish, | the higher-ups... - then you'll really hear something. | - That's the way to talk. - How about meeting Belle? | - It's about time. Belle, this is brotherJack. | Jack, Miss Fawcett. - How do you do? | - I've been looking forward to this for a long time. - You have? | - Yes. Dion isn't the only admirer | of beauty in the family. Thank you. - That was a very nice thing to say. | - I couldn't help... but look at you | all through the trial. Maybe that's why you lost your case. - Uh, can we drop you someplace? | - Oh, no. No thanks. I've, uh... I've got some things | to do here in the building. You know, it seemed kind of funny, | you and Dion on one side... and me on the other, | fighting each other. When we were kids, | we were always fighting. I bet if any other Irishers tried | to horn in... it was the O'Learys | against the world. - Oh, you said it. | - You two must've had fun when you were little. - We still do. - Even though | we don't always see eye-to-eye. Well, I've got | to leave you here... but I'll tell ya what you do, | Miss Fawcett... - or shall I call you "Belle"? | - Please do. Let Dion bring you up the house | some time for dinner, meet Ma. Well, I'd be | delighted. I wanna show you | some pictures of Dion... in his First Communion | suit at the age of nine. And some of you without any suit | at all at the age of six months. I wish you'd keep | an eye on this fellow for us. He's getting up in the world so fast, | it might go to his head. I'd kind of hate | to have to knock it off. I'll try. Good-bye. | See you soon. Good-bye, Jack. - You know, I like him. | - They don't make 'em any better. That was nice of him, | wanting me to meet your mother. Well, yes. I've been thinking | about that myself. Oh, don't. I understand how | she feels about me. Oh, Ma's all right... | A little old-fashioned, perhaps. Oh, please. I had no idea he was so... | so human. Oh, sure. | Takes after me. You know, there's something | almost normal about him. He just looks so real, you know | he believes everything he says. Honestly, it just makes me sick | to think of a man like Gil Warren... trying to run Chicago when there | are men here like your brother. Can you imagine the mayor | he'd make if he had the chance? Well, if he hadn't gotten mixed up | with that reform crowd... Wait a minute. - I've got an idea. | - What? I just thought what do with that check | Gil Warren gave me. Back to The Senate. In brief, we've come here | to ask you to run for mayor. - What? | - We have canvassed the field, and you're the man we want. Well, this is all | very flattering, gentlemen. May I... May I ask | whom you represent? The respectable | people of Chicago... citizens who want a new deal | in our city administration. We're organizing | a reform party. - I'm not sure I'm the man. | - We're willing to take that chance. - It's a great opportunity. | - Decent people are waiting for an honest program. You'll carry every district, except, | perhaps, Gil Warren's Patch. I'm not so sure | he won't get that too. Your brother's influential there. | Surely he'll support you. I'm afraid you can't | count on my brother. You see, we O'Learys | are a strange tribe. - Then we'll win without the Patch. | - Chicago needs you. - Yes, Mr. O'Leary. | - Will you do it, sir? Thank you, gentlemen. | I'll run. What did he say when you suggested | that I would support him? He said he's afraid he couldn't figure on you. Well, at least he's agreed to run. | That's the first step. What worries me is, | can you control him once he's in? He's a pretty stubborn | young fellow. You leave that to me. | We O'Learys are a strange tribe. - How's that? | - Not bad. Of course, it doesn't | look much like you. "Jack O'Leary, candidate for mayor. | Reform ticket. " That's a great thing for Chicago. | I'd like to help. - You help me? | - Sure. Why not? If other people say you're good enough | to be mayor, I'm not going to say no. Of course, I couldn't | support you openly. You know how I feel | about the Patch. Oh, of course. | No strings attached. - The fact you're my brother wouldn't mean a thing. | - Stop arguing, will you? If you stood in the way of something | I felt oughta be done... I'd go after you as fast as I would | after anybody else, maybe faster. Because I'm in dead earnest. I see Chicago | as a great city people can be proud of. I'd wipe out | all this mushroom growth... start all over on a sound basis, | with steel and stone. You don't have to make | speeches to me, Jack. I just wanted you | to know where I stand. - Well, how much do I owe you? | - I'm two games up on you. Ah. Twenty cents. | What a gambler. It's in the blood. It's in the blood. Say, why don't you get Belle and come to the | house tonight and take her and Ma for a drive? - Ha! You know Ma. | - We'll get a couple of beers under her belt. Well, heaven help us | if it doesn't work out. - To His Honor, the future mayor. | - To Chicago! And to herself, | the first lady of the city! Oh, to the lot of you! - The compliments of the season to you, ma'am. | - Oh, go on. More presents. You should see the grand house | we're gettin' for you. Inside plumbing. - And a butler in short pants. | - Heaven help me. It's himself. - Pa.! | - It looks just like him. Sure got my nose. I can remember the day we took it | like it was yesterday... and the trouble we had | puttin' the collar on him. - Well, Ma, where are we gonna hang him? | - Hang him? You'll do no such. He's gonna spend | the rest of his days on this organ. If he only could have seen it himself. Isn't he beautiful? | I want the baby to see it. Look, that's | your grandpa. Aw, Pat, | would you believe it? And Bob | just a baby himself. If you turn out half as good as the blood | that's in you, I'll not complain. You know, Ma, | it looks like Pa had... sort of a roving eye | for the ladies. I'll thank you to keep | a civil tongue in your head. Roving eye, ha! | I'd like to catch him. Look. You're so good to me, the lot of you. | You'll have me in tears. - Oh, Ma. Beer always did make you cry. | - Listen to him. We'll play him a tune, | his favorite one. - Come on, Ma, and play it. | - Come on, the four of you. We'll show him a thing or two. | The O'Learys against the world. The O'Learys against the world! | - We will. Come on, Ma. You should've seen your father dance, | as light as a canary... and stealing a kiss | before you could shut your eyes. And the fair Molly Callahan | loving it, I'm thinking. And why shouldn't I | be loving it? Himself as fine a man as ever stood up | with a girl in front of an altar. And that's what | you should be doin'. - That's what I was telling him today. | - Is it herself, you mean? I met Miss Fawcett. She's a fine woman. | You oughta know her. Hmm. I will not. And her workin' | in a saloon like any hussy. - Oh, that's not fair, Ma. We're living in modern times. | - That's right. Don't forget, things have changed | since you were a girl. This is 1870. Times may have changed, | but I haven't changed. And I don't want any daughter-in-law | that's the talk of the town... and kickin' her heels | in the air for anyone to see. When you were a little one, no bigger | than that, and me over a tub... I used to dream of the day when you'd | bring me home a sweet one... and her all blushes, | and present me with fine grandsons... as would be like sons | of my own, only sweeter. It's my own life, Ma. Who'll have some more beer? - Me. | - I wouldn't mind another drop. Here, Ma. | Put a head on it. Good evening, Mr. Jack. | Will you tell Mr. Dion his buggy's here? - Oh, thanks. | - He'll be right out. Now, Ma, drink your beer and forget | about it, and let's go for a ride, huh? Oh, sure. | How about it, Ma? - That I will. | - Oh, fine. I'll get your coat and hat. Aw, Ma. There you are. Drink it all, Ma. Come on, Ma. Now, First Lady, I've got | a real surprise for you... two of the fastest fillies | you ever sat behind. Now, close your eyes and get inside. | Close 'em. Up one step. There you go. Inside. Ma, this is Miss Fawcett. | This is Belle. - Hmm! So it's a trick. | - No, wait a minute! You're going to meet Belle, so you | might as well get used to the idea. - The devil I will. Let me out. | - Ma, you always were so stubborn. If you don't stop it, | I'll give you the licking of your life. - Well, you don't think I'm gonna ride with her! | - Oh, come back here! Sit down! Driver, drive on! Drive on! Let me out! Let me out, I say! - Sit still! | - Let me out! Stop it, I tell you! I won't be treated | this way! You Irish lunkhead! | What do you think you're doing? My son an Irish lunkhead? How'd you like | to be treated? You with your grand manners. Just as any woman who's going | to be his wife has a right to be treated. He'll never marry you. And now, | if you'll stop, I'll be takin'my leave. - Stop here. | - Whoa! - Wait. I'll get out. | - You'll do no such. It's you who'll be saving | the wear and tear of walking. - Ma. | - Hmm! How could you? I'm sorry. I didn't think | Ma would act like that. Take me home, please. My friends... this campaign | has resolved itself... into one | clear-cut issue. Shall the Patch | run Chicago... or shall Chicago | run the Patch? I promise you | that if I am elected... the Patch will | either be cleaned up... or it will be wiped out | like that. Hooray for Gil Warren.! - Who said that? | - Shh, shh. - Oh, it's a shame. | - The trouble with him is he looks too honest. People never trust | an honest man in office. Well, I wish | he hadn't tried it. He'll never beat Warren. Never say never | about politics. What are you up to now? Well, I was just wondering | what would happen... if all Gil Warren's ward heelers | and poll watchers and repeaters... failed to show up | on Election Day. - What do you mean? | - He wouldn't stand much chance of being elected, would he? George, drive | to Commissioner Beavers'. Gil Warren's my friend. | I won't do it. I can't. I won't do it! I can't! | I'll be ruined forever. For doing your duty? Oh, come, come, | Commissioner. Be a man. He'll kill me. Besides, what you're asking is against | the law, against all my principles. You've been getting $100 a week | for doing what I tell you. Every cent I got | was in cash. Sure, I paid you in cash, but I always | sent it by a different man. What? What do you mean? Those 15 or 20 people would make fine | witnesses if you ever got any ideas. Blackmail, eh? All right. I'll fight. Go ahead. Fight. And you'll be back pounding the pavement | so quick, it'll make your head swim. Come on. | He'll be there. Hey, you! | Where's your ticket? - I'm with him. | - You know this guy? - I never saw him before in my life. | - One of us is in error. Outside, before I cloud up | and rain all over you. - That severs our relationship. | - One of them Reform guys. They got no manners. Belle, when you were working | for me at The Hub... I bet you didn't think you'd be having the | first dance with the future mayor, did you? Are you counting your chickens | before they're hatched? - It's a lead pipe cinch. | - Oh. You looking for me, | Commissioner? Hey, look what you done | to my suit! - Hey, what's the idea? | - Stop it! Stop them, somebody.! | Stop them, somebody.! Stop them.! Ladies and gentlemen! | The house is pinched! Stay back! Get back! | You can't get out this way. Can you beat that? And just when | we were beginning to have a little fun. You let me catch you with that Colby | woman again, and you won't call it fun. Come on, come on. | Inside. Inside. All right, | take it away. - What about it, chief? | - Yes, what about it? It's all right, boys. It's all right. | You haven't got a thing to worry about. I'll have you out of here | in no time at all. - What about the bail? | - If it's bail they want, I've got it! Better hurry, chief. | The polls are open already. Don't worry. You'll be at your posts | in 30 minutes. All right. What's the bail? Sorry, Mr. Warren. Orders are to hold them | 24 hours without bail... - On suspicion. | - What kind of suspicion? - Suspicion of what? | - Just plain suspicion. You can't do that. This is Election Day. | They're my workers. By the Eternal, | you've got to let them go! - It ain't up to me. | - I'll get the commissioner! I'll get Senator Colby! I'll get my lawyer! | I'll tear this town wide open! - Where's Commissioner Beavers? | - Gone to the sanitarium. - What sanitarium? | - I'm not allowed to give out his address. Doctor's orders. - Where's Judge Bender? | - Oh, the jud-jud-judge... - I've got to seeJudge Bender! | - Judge Bender left... on a h-hunting trip | this m-morning. All the jud-judges | in town went with him. They're o-organizing | a h-hunting club. - Then I've got to see Senator Colby. | - I'm afraid that's imposs... You can't do it. | See, S-Senator Colby... It's 12:00! The polls have been opened | six hours, and I'm tied hand and foot! Every man in that jail controls at least | 10 votes, enough to swing the election. - What are we gonna do? | - We're gonna stop squawking. - What's that? | - You're through. I've sold you out. Don't try anything, Warren. And now, if you'll excuse me, | I'll go and vote for my brother. We O'Learys | are a strange tribe. Look at him. You know, | he really looks like a mayor. Gee, I bet Ma feels great. Dion, look at this! Huh. Huh, indeed. Belle, we're friends, | aren't we? I hope so. I've got a proposition | to put up to you. It may startle you at first, | but I think you'll see my point. I'm gonna clean out the Patch. I want | to be sure Dion doesn't oppose me. - And you want me to help you? | - Exactly. But after all, | what has it to do with me? You know how things | are down there. Everything that's rotten in | Chicago comes out of the Patch. The whole thing is an atmosphere | of vice and crime. It's getting out of control, | and I'm gonna wipe it out. How? The law gives us the right | to condemn property. The courts will have it | appraised and set a fair price. It's what they call the right of eminent | domain. It's perfectly legal and fair. But all of Dion's money | is tied up in The Senate. Mine too. That's what's worrying me. If he won't see it our way, | there'll be trouble. I don't know what to say. Dion's a great person. | He can go anywhere, do anything... if he only gets | on the right track. Belle, I want | to see him marry you... have a home and children, | get something real out oflife. Don't you think that's | what I've been hoping for? That's what he wants too, | if he can only see it. What do you want me to do? He couldn't stand | a public investigation. You know how he operates | in the Patch. I couldn't do | a thing like that. Believe me, Belle... if I can't bring him | to his senses any other way... I'll start an investigation | that'll crack this town wide open. I'll use you | as chief witness against Dion... let you tell the whole rotten story | ofhow he operates in the Patch. How do you feel | about that, Belle? I just wanted Belle | to understand my position... same as I want you | to understand it. - Dion, listen toJack. | - I heard him. I know now where he stands. You knew exactly where | I stood before the election. I told you and I told | the people of this city. - I elected you, not the people. | - You? Sure. It was my idea. I sent | that committee to see you. I paid for it, ran it, framed it, | threw Warren's men into jail. I even voted for you. I don't believe you. Is that true? - Yes. | - I just wanted it to look hunky-dory. Why did you want me | to be mayor? Oh, a lot of reasons. | I wanted to see if I could do it. Or maybe it was because I wanted | to see the smile on Ma's face... when she rode with you | in the carriage election night. All right. You elected me, | but I'm mayor. Yes, you're mayor, | but I'm Chicago. I'd hate to | have to kick you out. Don't try it. A lot of people | like what I'm doing. - What are you going to get out of this? | - Nothing. But I happen to have sense enough to see | whatJack's after, even if you haven't. - Now, wait a minute. Don't you two start... | - You keep out of this! Well, of course, | since you've gone for Reform... I guess we won't be seeing | very much of each other. You're not gonna walk out | on Belle like that. It seems that she's the one | that's done the walking out. Dion. Dion! Oh! A grandjury investigation.! | Terrible.! Terrible.! How did you ever get involved | in such a mess? I wouldn't be a bit surprised | if you weren't... in for a bit of sweatin' | yourself, Senator. You've been milkin' the Patch | for a long time. Me? Why I'll give you to understand, sir, | that my life is an open book. Open or shut, brother, your shirttail's | out with the rest of us. It's my daughter | I'm thinking of. I'll have to take her to Europe, | get her away from here. - The trip would do her good. | - I'll have to ask you... not to see my daughter | again ever. - To think I should be so deceived in the character... | - I've always wanted to see... what a senator looks like... when he gets a good, | swift kick in the pants. - Oh, Hattie, hurry, will you? | - I'm hurrying, honey. Miss Belle, | you want this old plush? Yes. No. Throw it away. | I don't care what you do with it. Oh, this just fits | in my trunk. Now, Miss Belle, ain't a bit of use | in you carryin' on like this. - Ain't no man worth it! | - Oh, Hattie, hurry, will you? I'm hurryin, honey. - Get out of here! | - I'm gettin' out, honey. - Get out of here! | - Belle, don't act like that. Belle, I want to talk to you. Hattie, get out of the way! - Get him away from me! | - Get out of here, white man! - Hattie, help me! Help me! | - Murder! Police! Help! - Get out! | - Belle, please. I'm sorry, | but I had to come. Just let me say one thing, | then you can put me out. I won't care. - Oh, please go. | - I don't ask you to forgive me. I've said and done things | no woman could ever forgive. But you've got to believe | I love you, Belle. I always have | and I always will. Oh, why talk about it? But you said you loved me. That's over. You can't change in a moment | any more than I can. We can't do | without each other. I can. | I'll make myself. Oh, we've fought, and maybe we'll | go on fighting, but we'll do it together. We were meant | for each other. Belle, marry me. Now. Tonight. I've got the license | and the ring. We'll go toJack, | have him marry us. Will you, Belle? Oh, my darling! Come on, Mr. Policeman. | Right in here. She... She's done | backslid again. Do you realize that 75% | of the buildings in the Patch... are made of pine? There are no sewers, | no hydrants. Nothing but filth, cesspools. But worst of all, | it is a veritable firetrap. Now, that sort of thing may have been | excusable when Chicago was just beginning... but that time has passed. Today it's a menace | to a great city... a cancer | that must be cut out. Now, I propose to condemn | the whole district... wipe it out | and start all over again. Yes, what is it? Tell him | I'll be right out. Will, uh, you gentlemen | go ahead with the discussion... and excuse me | for a little while, please? Yes, Mr. Mayor. Well, Jack, you've won. - I've won what? | - I've been a fool. I wouldn't take a million | for this moment. Now it's really the O'Learys | against the world. Well, here's the little | lady who's responsible. As if I didn't know it. As the mayor of this great and noble city, | can you marry people? Marry? Why, sure! Wait a minute. | I'm not so sure. But I'll find out. What a mayor. Is there anything in the charter about | whether the mayor can perform a marriage? - I don't know, sir, but I'll find out. | - Hurry up and find out! "Having taken these pledges | of your affection and vows of fidelity... "I do, therefore, by right of | the authority in me vested... "by the laws | of the state of Illinois... "pronounce you, | Dion Patrick O'Leary... "and you, | Belle Catherine Fawcett... lawfully married, | husband and wife. " That makes us | kissing kin, doesn't it? - I don't have to tell you how lucky you are. | - That's right. - I just want to say congratulations. | - Thank you. I wish you every happiness | and... good night. Congratulations. | Good night. You'll never know | how much all this means to me. Remember that day | I told you he wasn't so bad? The O'Learys | are a strange tribe. Right. Now, let's go home | and tell Ma, huh? Sure, but first there's just one | little matter I'd like to clear up. And now, Mrs. O'Leary, suppose | you go ahead and testify against me? Listen to him. You didn't think I was gonna | let you two get away with it, did you? - Why, Dion! | - Go ahead with your grand jury investigation. She's my wife, | and you know the law... A wife cannot testify | against her husband. Oh! Belle, where | are you going? What do you think of that? Why, you dirty... I haven't licked you | since we were kids. Of all the low, disgusting tricks | you ever pulled, this is the worst. Well, you won't | get away with it. I'm gonna wipe out the Patch | and you along with it! - Johnson! | - Yes, sir. I've sent for the police. I don't want the police! | Get the city attorney! Tell him to start | the condemnation proceedings. And you get out of here! I never | want to see your face again! Get the police commissioner. | Tell him to swear in 500 special deputies. Get the newspapers. Tell them that when | I get through with the Patch... - there won't be a stick or stone left standing. | - Yes, sir. Hey, one at a time. | Quit that nudging. You'd think you | never been fed before. You're so full already, you oughta be | sleepin' it off on the parlor sofa. Mutter, Mutter, | komm schnell! Stop that heathen | jabbering and talk sense! Dion, Jack, they fight! | Bitte, Mutter, komm.! The devil you say! You can take one more nip | while I'm knockin' their heads together. - Dion married Belle Fawcett. | - What? Yeah, Jim Fellows | just came by to tell us. Dion and Jack have had a knock-down, | drag-out fight about the Patch. - And them grown-up and brothers. | - I'm gonna find 'em. Wait. I'll go with you. And wait till I get | my hands on that Dion... fightin' and marryin' | that creature behind my back. Mrs. O'Leary! | Mrs. O'Leary! Oh, Mrs. O'Leary! | Your barn! Look! Look! I didn't put the bar | between Daisy's legs. Fire! Fire! Get Daisy and the calf | and the horse! Get that baby | back into the house! Fire! Turn the alarm! | Fire! Turn the alarm! Fire! Come on, boys! Never mind the barn! | Let it go! Save the house! | The house! Mrs. O'Leary, I'm gettin' out | everything that I can. Mrs. Donovan, your | own house is a-goin'! Me own house? Mrs. O'Leary, | me own house is a-burnin'! - Get that cow! | - Come on, Daisy! Come on! Get a hose over here.! Come on.! Giddyap. - Chief! | - Dion! Here I am, Pickle! Dion, oh, Dion! - What's the matter? | - There's a big fire in the Patch! - Yeah? Where? | - DeKoven Street. The whole street's goin'! You suppose that's | some of the mayor's doings? Sure. The mayor's | burning us out. - He said he'd get us. | - Said he wouldn't leave a stick or a stone standing. - Looks bad, boy. | - Yeah, burning us out, huh? - Couldn't even wait for condemnation proceedings. | - I'll go with you. No, you stay here. | I've gotta find out how Ma is. Give the boys a drink. | I'll be back in half an hour. He's asked for a fight. | Well, I'll give it to him. Well, what'll | you fellas have? - I'll take some of this. | - Mighty funny business. - What? | - Well, I'm not saying anything... but I haven't got much faith in these fights | between brothers... not when they're O'Learys. They've pulled some pretty | smart tricks in the past... and I wouldn't put it | past 'em to do it again. You heard what Dion said! No one's gonna | burn him out, brother or no brother. Well, I hope not. When I was running things, | nothing like this happened. - Hmm! Come on, fellas. | - All right, boys. You heard what he said. Spread the word. We'll have something | to say about bein' run out of the Patch. Wait a minute. | Get the boys together. - Tell them that I said we'll meet at the armory. | - We'll get this Jack O'Leary! Back up! Back up! | I've gotta get through! Back up! Here, I think I can make | better time on foot. All right, boys! | Put her on the other roof! - Mommy! | - Mommy! Mommy! Mary! All right, boys, pump! It's moving might fast in this wind, | leaping ahead blocks at a time. The Patch is like tinder. There hasn't been a drop of rain | for nearly three months. We've got to keep it away from the gas works. | We gotta keep it south of the river. Have you any suggestions, | General Sheridan? Yes. Make a firebreak | at the edge of the Patch. Blow up that entire section | along Randolph Street. - Fight this fire with dynamite! | - I authorize you to do everything possible to stop this fire. Commissioner, | mobilize your whole force. Swear in as many deputies as you need. | Clear that whole area. - Requisition all the foodstuffs you need. | - Yes, sir. Donovan, you and Johnson get in touch | with Milwaukee, all the surrounding cities. Ask them to send us | all the fire apparatus they can. Wire Washington. Tell them we're gonna | need relief... money, medicine, troops. - Keep me advised. I'll be with Gen. Sheridan. | - Yes, sir. Miss Belle, | pull yourself together! Come on, honey. Let's get outta here. | Come on, baby. Pull yourself together. Let's get out | of here before judgment day gets us. Come on, honey. Come on. Bob! Bob! | Where's Ma? She's gone to the North Side with Gretchen | and the baby in the wagon. They had to go. Our house | was the first to burn. - Our house? Why, that dirty... Where did they start it? | - In our barn. Ma heard about you fighting, she left the | lantern in there and Daisy kicked it over. I thoughtJack did it | to burn out the Patch. That mob thinks so too. | We gotta get to him. - Well, where is he? | - I don't know, but we've gotta stop that mob. - Back up, I tell you! | - How can I back up? Why can't you look | where you're going? Get that flea-bitten | thing out of here! Come, darling, get out. | We have to walk. Wait! I'll just | be gettin' it. I'll not be leavin' his picture. | It's all I've got left. That fool cow! Look out! The wall! It's falling! Mutter.! - Gretchen! Gretchen! | - Mutter.! Gretchen! Don't waste any time. | Get those people behind the line. - Captain! | - Yes, sir? Take all of your men you can spare. | Use some of mine if necessary. Search every building. See that no one | is left behind. No one! Quickly! Yes, sir. Sergeant, move all police lines back | one full block and let no one through! Hey, where are you going? - I've got to get through to The Senate. | - Nobody's going through. Mayor's orders. The streets cleared. | They're gonna dynamite. - Dynamite? | - Yeah, to make a firebreak. Come on, open up! Get back! | Back to the next corner! - Come on. Back to the next block. | - What are you gonna do? I don't know. | Jack! Jack! Get back! Come on! - I've gotta get through.! | - Jack! Jack, I... Turn him loose. | I'll take care of him. Get away from here, | you dirty, contemptible liar. I've stood for all | I'm gonna stand from you. I've got work to do, | and nobody is gonna stop me.! You've got to listen to me! Gil Warren | and his mob are out to get you! Everybody down here thinks you set fire to | the Patch. They're organizing against you. It's my fault. | I thought so too. - You lowdown, good-for-nothing... | - Jack! Until I got home and found the house | burned to the ground... - Ma, Gretchen and the baby gone. | - Where are they? I put 'em in a wagon and started them | for the North Side. They oughta be | across the river by now. I'm sorry. I should have known better. | Jack, you've got to believe me. There's Gil Warren | and his gang now. What the devil do I care | about Warren and his gang now? The only thing that matters is that | we're together and thinking alike. Come on! There they are, men! | Just like I told you. The O'Learys. | The three of'em together. You men, hold that line! | Don't let anybody through. Keep those people back. I don't care | how you do it, but keep them back! Right. Men! Listen! | Listen, men! The fire was an accident. My brother | didn't have anything to do with it. That's what you say, | but we know different. We've got to dynamite. | It's our only chance to save Chicago! Let it burn.! Men! Men! Think! That's just what we're doing. Thinking. | Thinking it's another O'Leary trick. - Mayor O'Leary.! | - Yes, General? Have your men move this crowd | back to the end of that street. - The dynamite is set. We're ready to light. | - All right, move that crowd! Push them back! | Get 'em back! Oh, no, you don't! We're not moving! | No one's running us out. We got rights too, | and we know where we stand. You're not gonna blow us up. | You don't dare. We're not gonna let 'em destroy | our homes to save their own. We're staying right here. | We'll show 'em who they're dealing with. They don't own Chicago. | They're... What? Hey.! Look.! Look.! | Stop him, somebody.! Dion! Dion! Don't move an inch, men. | We've got our rights. - Dion! | - Jack, light 'em. Light 'em! - You're hurt. | - It's just a scratch. Get back, you fools! | All of you! And keep back! Light 'em. Dion! Dion! Get back, and keep back.! Get him, Rondo.! | Rondo, get him.! Get him, Rondo.! Get those fuses out.! | Pull 'em down.! Pull 'em down.! Get 'em down.! We're too late! We're too late! | Run for your lives, men! - We can't put 'em out.! | - Run for your lives! Where's Jack? Jack! Open up! Help! Help! Help! On to the lake, folks! Cast off! Let go of that forward line | and get this boat away from here! There's 10,000 barrels | of kerosene in that warehouse. If this boat catches fire, | the warehouse is sure to go... and we'll take | the whole North Side with us! Try to get through | to the North Side! On to the lake.! Bob.! Bob.! Bob.! That's Gretchen! - Bob! | - Gretchen.! Bob! Gretchen! - Bob.! | - Gretchen! Bob! Bob! Gretchen! Take your foot | off that picture! Oh! Mrs. O'Leary! I thought I saw you. | Lean on me. - Go on. Save yourself. | - Please, Mrs. O'Leary. - Oh, it's you. | - Give me your arm. - I will not. | - You'll be killed! I'll not be owing | my life to you! Hattie! Hattie! | Hattie! Come on. | Get up, please. Please. Come on. | Come on. - Go on and save yourself. | - I won't leave you. Hattie! Hattie! - You married him. | - Hattie! I married him, | but it's all over now. He only married me | to save the Patch. You're lyin'. He loves you, and you turned | him against his own people. - He doesn't love me. | - But you love him. Hattie! Yes. Yes, I love him. - Try, Mrs. O'Leary. | - I can't do it. - Please. | - No, it's no use. I'm done for. Please help me. Please help me, | won't you? Won't you, please? Dion, any | word of them? No. No, I've been | all over the North Shore. There's not | a trace of them. You stay with Gretchen. | I'll look. No. I'm gonna try | the South Shore. Mommy! Mommy.! Mommy.! Mommy.! Mommy.! Ma. Ma! Ma! Ma! Heaven be praised! | It's Dion! Oh, Dion! - Oh, Ma! | - Dion! - Oh, Ma! | - Oh, Dion, Dion! - Ma! | - Are you hurt? Come on. Come on up | out of the wet. - Oh, my child. | - Ma. Where are the others? Bob and Gretchen | and the baby are all right. And Jack? Oh, Ma. He's dead? - Did you make it up with him? | - Yes. Then I'll not be weepin'. It's the livin' | that need lookin' after. Belle... - Belle? | - What kind of a woman are you... with that kind of a heart | and him your husband? It's gone, and | my boy's gone with it. But what he stood for | will never die. It was a city of wood, | and now it's ashes. But out of the fire | will be coming steel. You didn't live | to see it, my lad... no more than your | father did before you. God rest the two of you. But there's Dion left, | and his children to come after. He'll have his dream, Ma. Nothing can lick Chicago, | any more than it could lick him. Aye. That's the truth. We O'Learys | are a strange tribe. There's strength in us. And what we set out to do, | we finish.
