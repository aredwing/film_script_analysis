Swoosh Scenes of chaos tonight at the gotham city theatre Where the joker has interrupted The prestigious man of the year awards. Watch the suit, boys. This was the fifth annual man of the year ceremony held in gotham But only the second to be brought to a premature end 'by a gang of rampaging villains. ' Computer... I have an election to win. Grr. Looks like another stay in arkham asylum for the joker. Hmm. Love you, joker! I'll win in a landslide. Huh? Oh, come on. 'First batman, second superman. ' Kryptonite. 'Batman seems to have recovered all the stolen property' Including bruce wayne's man of the year award. The only thing left for joker, a swift return to arkham asylum. Along with the title, goon of the year. This is clark kent on assignment in gotham city For daily planet online. 'Hey! ' I was watching that. Too much television is bad for you, pumpkin. How does he sneak all that stuff in? Clark kent! Really despise that guy. Coming all the way to gotham city to insult me. Me, a hometown boy who made good. 'You're right. You don't deserve that. ' That's right. I don't. Eh, wait. Who said that? 'How would you like to be out of arkham right now' 'and given a chance to take revenge on batman' 'and the rest of this ungrateful city? ' Well, I'd have to be crazy to say no to that offer. Unless you're just one of the voices in my head. In which case, I'm crazy anyway. What! Bang Oh, hey, lex! You've come to get your watch back? Or did a bus from metropolis get lost and breakdown? First, I don't take the bus. And second, yes, give me my watch. So, what you got there? This, my friend, is the deconstructor. It emits a unique energy. One that is absorbed so quickly by any... Shiny black object That it causes it to pull itself apart. What! Nifty! What's it got to do with me? First, I need help replacing its power source. It doesn't run on aa batteries. Kryptonite. And second, I might need some of that joker gas You are so good at making. Oh, yeah. I guess that could come in handy For someone running for president. You help me, you can use the deconstructor To your heart's content. Quack, quack... Know anybody who has lots of shiny, black, unbreakable toys? I don't know who you're referring to. Come on! Batman! Oh. You were... Joking. I'm the joker. 'Prisoner escape! Repeat, prisoner escape! ' We should be going. Can I just have one try? A- ah! Joker, come on. It's a shame. Now someone's going to have to fix this. But the good news is, I'm out of prison. Joker! Hey, what's going on? - It's a riddle. - Oh, come on! That's my thing. 'Justice league watchtower calling batman. ' Justice league watchtower calling batman. This is batman. Just checking your location in case of emergency. I'm in the batcave. Sounds like an emergency. It's alright. I got it. You got dressed fast. Well, I've just started sleeping in the costume now. Whoa! May I? Oh, well, I think I should do it. I thought you were going to let me play with that thing. Dah! What's this? Do I need this? Boom Nah! Joker, could we move things along? You're no fun to shop with, lexie. Grr! Whoa! Hey! Wait! Stop! Okay, we can go. On second thought, I have an idea! Joker, come on! I'm an artiste. I like to challenge myself with a bigger canvas. Commissioner. Oh, thank goodness you're here. No problem, jim. Commissioner gordon is what you need to call him. What's the situation? There's been a breakout at arkham. 'The bridge automatically submerges' 'during a prison break. ' 'Unfortunately, it's so old' 'it takes a long time to raise again. ' Crash I'll get over there and start cleaning up. Batman, wait for me. - You won't make it. - Oh, yeah? Watch me. Uh, robin, I think you should listen to your-your-your batman. Don't worry about me, jim. Uh, commissioner gordon. Oh, man, should've listened. Should've listened. Yep, should've listened. Hey, come on, get him. Yeah. Eat a brick, batman! What do we do? You put your bike back together, I'll take care of this. 'They've got the high ground. ' But I've got better aim. Ouch! Wow! That was easy. A little too easy. They were only meant to distract us. From what? Boo! Holy baloney! Totally scared catwoman. Did you see that? Oh, robin. Come on, you've got to give me this one. Now, robin, what were you saying? Something catty, I believe. Alright, everybody, back inside. Let's ask the coin. Yeah, the coin says "no. " You know that's where you're gonna end up eventually. Not this time. Boo! Perfect! You brought my bike. Oh! Oh! Can I drive? I wanna drive. You gotta let me drive. Sorry, harley quinn, the coin says "no. " You take catwoman. I'll get the three in the jeep. - What about the others? - We've got time. Bane's mole machine is not built for speed. Go. Bad news, two-face. Batman's on our tail. So, we'll lose him in the sculpture garden. Okay. Oh, for crying out loud! Left or right? Left. What are you doing? Turn! Oh, without the coin I don't know which way to go. Oh, stop it. Crash Riddler baby, you should've... Let you drive. I know! Ha ha ha. You're not gonna find any cheese in this maze, rat-boy. Rat-boy? You get rat-boy from robin? A- ah! You were saying... Something catty, I believe. Aha! It's defined now! Bang I can't control it. Click Boom Bang Ow! Bang Argh! Boom boom boom. Well, we contained the break out. All the prisoners are accounted for. Except the joker. He must've been the first one to break out. Smuggled in some kind of explosives. No, I don't think so. There'd be blast marks, powder burns, something. It's as if the bricks just flew out. Well, yeah. No, I mean, you didn't let me finish. I was gonna say, was gonna say smuggled in some explosives Which would be the usual way, he would break out. Which he didn't, because there is no sign of an explosive. Mm-hmm. Hey, look at this. Mm-hmm. Looks like some kind of residual radiation. Packaging remote tie-in. Bat computer. Remote tie-in, active. Identify residual radiation. Radiation consistent with energy signature Of u. S. Defense department project. J.S. G- 817 currently under development at lex corp. Well, I think we know who broke joker out of prison. Lex luthor. What would an upstanding presidential candidate Like lex luthor want with the joker? I've heard that lex luthor may not be so upstanding. You might wanna tell somebody. Election day is tomorrow. Sir, there's been a break in at ace chemicals. Wouldn't be surprised if that was joker's first stop. Wait! Ha-ha-ha. buffalo gal won't you come out tonight come out tonight buffalo gal won't you come out tonight and dance by the light of the moon Blurp Joker, how's it coming? You can't mess something like this. Ding Oh! Lex! It's a boy. Ha-ha-ha. Duh-duh-duh. Argh! Just like arkham. So, I can stop carrying this? I mean, now we have other samples. L- I can't go anywhere without making a mess. He didn't just break in here to do this. Come on. Promethium, xenon, mercury, tantalum and dialum. And those aren't the chemicals he spilt all over the floor? No. So, uh, we're gonna leave now, right? Yes. Boom Got to give it to the joker, that is kinda cool. It'll be really cool when that fire ignites The rest of the chemicals in the building. What's that? Acid. It'll soften the planks. Poof Boom Ooh! Oh! Hey, guys. - Wow! - Calm down. Ha ha ha. Whoo. Again. Wow! That is great. Isn't that great, batman? Destroyed all the evidence of the crime scene. So, who blew this up? Long story. We've got it covered. Okay, well, just let me know, uh, volcano in mexico. Call me, if you need me. Uh, batman, maybe he could help with this. I mean, he's had a lot of experience Dealing with lex luthor. We don't need him. Well, it seems like just now we needed him. We'd have been fine jumping off the roof. I think we would have broken our legs. We've broken our legs before. Yeah, but I didn't like it. I mean, if we just call him. Robin. We can't go through life expecting superman Or anyone else to save us whenever things get tough. The only people we can rely on, is ourselves. Bat computer, tie-in. Bat computer remote tie-in. Active. Access chemical database. What substance can be produced to recombination Of the following chemicals? Promethium, xenon, mercury, tantalum and dialum? Accessing. No substance found. What substance can be approximated Through the combination of the chemicals? 'Accessing. ' 'Listed chemicals can combine to form' 'an approximation of kryptonite. ' Kryptonite? We better call superman. We're not... Going to call superman. Activate tracking systems. Detect nearby sources of kryptonite. Affirmative. There it is. Maybe, we should let superman know. We do and we'll be putting him in danger. Can we ever leave together? Ugh! No! You tricked me. Oh, don't worry. Ha ha ha. Nice job. So, lex, when you're president Can I be vice president? I think we've got company. You didn't answer my question. Click. 'Auto drive, activated. ' Click. Poof Ugh! Aha! Kryptonite. Batman! Argh! Pow Oh, my goodness. Beaten again. No hard feelings. Hmm. Uh-ah! Click Bang Argh! Whoo-ho-ho. Uh... Where's your car? Argh! Bang Substance is 84% similar to kryptonite. No harmful effects to natives of krypton. 'That doesn't make sense. ' I had the bat mobile tracking kryptonite. It wouldn't have picked this up. There must have been kryptonite in the van. What's the point of making kryptonite That wouldn't harm superman anyway. We'll put it away with the other kryptonite just to be safe. 'Why do we have so much of this stuff? ' I keep it in case superman decides to be a bad guy one day. You expect the worst of everybody. Yeah. What's happened? We've lost the signal. Don't worry. It's directly ahead. Beyond these walls, friend Lie the keys to the destruction of superman. And batman too, right? Sure. Yeah. Fine. 'Intruder alert! Intruder alert! ' Someone's broken into the batcave? 'Fake kryptonite. ' It was a homing device. We were set up. Hello! Anybody home? We're here. And we brought deserts. Come on, we're guests. You can't offer us a lousy cup of coffee? Ah! Hey, is that the batboat? Bang Oh, gee. Ha ha. Could've sworn it was there a minute ago. Hey, look. The batwing. Oh. Must be seeing things. We gotta get outta here. - But, batman... - go. Hey, batman, penny for your thoughts? Bang Oh! Are we going upstairs? I'd love to see the rest of the place. Bang Going down. Boom We don't have a lot of time. Jump! Uh-oh! Argh! Let him go, we have to find the vault. You're right. It's time to serve desert. Where does he keep the kryptonite? I just know he has it. Not where he hides it. Computer, where is the kryptonite? Kryptonite location is protected By security access codes. Computer, do you know who I am? Lex luthor, presidential candidate Owner and founder of lexcorp industries. Very good. Now, I'd like... A corporation that serves as a cover For a variety of luthor's criminal operations. Whoo hee-hee. Involving smuggling, robbery, extortion, bribery. Yeah, alright. That's enough. Here. Let me do it. Yeah! Security access, verified. Whoosh - Hmm. - Huh. How much time do we have before those pies go off? Oh, like five minutes. Boom Maybe that was five seconds. - Run. - Argh! Maybe we should call for superman. Go ahead. Hey, superman! See, you can't rely on anyone. Boom Kaboom Nice job. Art is always better if it's bigger. Hey, isn't that bruce wayne's mansion? Bruce wayne? Really despise that guy. Hey, guys, sorry it took me a second. Boom Hey, batman, I think I fixed the whirly-bat. Crash Uh. I'm... Gonna go work on the batboat now. Why didn't you tell me luthor was involved? I was handling it. Yeah, looks like you had it all under control. Look, I'll hang around and give you a hand. Remember, I can do anything. Swoosh You know what was in there? - What? - Kryptonite. Aha! Boom That's what they wanted the whole time. It must be what powers that deconstructing device. I picked up krypton on the batmobile scanner. So, now they can neutralize your gadgets and my powers. Question is why? What are they up to? I don't know. Tomorrow is election day, so we're running out of time. We'll just have to go ask lex luthor. You're just going to walk right into lexcorp headquarters? Yep. You worried? Superman does not worry. 'We can take this to get there. ' Introducing, the new, flying batboat. - You need a hand? - No, I'm good. A- ah! Ugh! Vice president joker. Doesn't quite sound right, does it, lex? Not really. No. Alright, sun will be up soon And the voters will be heading out to vote. Let's shut it down. 'Okay, did not need to turn off all the lights. ' Not the way I like to travel. Come on, cheer up, sourpuss. Not cool. Swoosh - Oh, after you. - Argh. We're here to see lex luthor. And you are? Seriously? Seriously. I'm superman. He's batman. Are those last names? Even his receptionist is evil. - Just one name each. - Like madonna. Oh, I see, you're down here. Mr. Luthor is expecting you. First elevator. What's that song? Sounds familiar. I don't listen to music. Either of you guys know the score of the game? I don't follow sports. Seven-three, st. Louis. Ah. Ah, shouldn't have asked. Nice costumes. Hmm. Lex? Right here. I'll take it from here. Hmm. Woa-ah! 'You feel okay, superman? ' I hope you voted before you got here. 'Because you might not be leaving. ' You diseased maniac. No one is going to elect you president. Oh, yes, they will. Once we've flown over the country Dispensing my friend, joker's gas, I'll win in a landslide. I was going to be vice president But I changed my mind. It wasn't working for me. Since I was deprived of the man of the year award In gotham city, we're starting at their city hall. Sorry, you won't be there. 'When I'm president, I'll build a statue of you. ' Oh! You're not going to build him a statue. No, I'm not. But you won't be there to call me on it. Wait a second! What are you going to do to the dynamic dumdum? Joker, I have an election to win. But who will I play with if he's dead? Robin's still around. If we eliminate batman Robin will probably put on the suit and say he's batman. No, it won't be the same. Crash Wow, did not expect that. Let's go get out the vote. 'Alright. ' What the... Boom Crash Joker, do you know how expensive that was? I've no idea what it cost, no. Swoosh Crash Nice plan. Now, we know what they're up to. Plop - We have to get to gotham city. - I should warn you. I fly close to that kryptonium... We'll cross that bridge when we get to it. Whoosh Swoosh Thwack Whoosh I thought I took care of him. If I had a dollar for every time I said that. Keep flying. I'll deal with this. Woa-ah! Ah! Lex, we're losing altitude. Crash - You alright? - Yeah. Being that close to the kryptonite weakened me. We bought ourselves a few minutes. We've got to get to the centre of town. I don't think I can fly yet. I guess we can get there some other way. Splash Hiss Two dollars or a token. Uh... I have tokens. Fellow citizens, thank you for joining me today. I don't want to keep you from voting for too long. I just wanna say a few words. 'What do you think of your presidential candidate? ' We love him. And you'll do anything he says? - We'll do anything he says. - We want him as president. Let's go vote for him. That's good to hear. Now, I have a lot of other campaign stops to make today. So, just say it with me now. Vote for... Joker. - Joker for president. - We love joker. Oh, did I forget to mention? The gas just works for me. Sorry. Oversight. You, dirty double-crosser! You tricked me. I said vice president didn't work for me. President joker. Now, that sounds right. The vice part goes without saying Now get in and I'll let you be vice president. Don't be such an idiot! They're going to take off. I've got some of my strength back. The kryptonite. I'll slow them down, batman. It'll be up to you to stop them. Bang Thud This time, lex I'm going to pull batman apart... Literally. Woa-ah! Swoosh Huh? Crash Robin... Great job. What? I... Think I'm going to cry. Get goin'. Oh. Take a left up here. Take a hard right. Now left. - We're not losing them. - I'm not trying to. Left again. - Where have you been? - Getting some help. Well, batman, any last words? Yeah. Look, you're on tv. Ah... Oh, it's beautiful. It's also visible from space, you idiot. Calling all justice leaguers. 'Calling all justice leaguers.

It's in his chest. - Argh. - Ugh. Wonder woman. Lead your plane. Uh? Wow! Ha ha ha. - Well, that was fun. - Ugh... Ah. There is a little good news. At least, you're not going to be president. - Great work, batman. - I have to admit. I couldn't have done it without a little help from my friends. Uh, a little? Well, bruce wayne said, when he was given The, man of the year award... ...That "everybody needs help now and again. " Well, he was a wise man. What did you do with all the kryptonite? I put it in a safe place. We might need it one day if, superman decides to go bad. - See! I'm not the only one. - You know, I can hear you. So bats, you need a little help rebuilding the bat cave? - No, robin and I... - yes, we'd like some help. Say it with me. Okay, we probably could use some. Are, are you asking me? Are you asking me to help you rebuild the bat cave? Well, no. I was asking, green lantern. I don't think this is your color. 'Jovian. ' I have located it.
