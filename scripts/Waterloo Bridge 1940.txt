At 11: 15 this morning, the prime minister... ... speaking to the nation from Number 10 Downing Street... ... announced that Great Britain is at war with Germany. The London public are earnestly reminded... ... of the emergency orders already issued. No light of any description should be visible after blackout time. No dogs or cats will be allowed to roam the streets after dark. It should be remembered that pets will not be permitted in public air-raid shelters. Gas masks and warm clothing should be placed at hand before retiring. It is suggested that a warm drink in a Thermos... ... would be of great comfort to children... ... who might have to be awakened at an unusual hour. Every effort should be made to quiet the nerves... ... of those children who remain despite the evacuation... ... which will continue until a late hour this evening. MAN: Colonel Cronin's car. I was right, Thomas. It's tonight. To France, sir? Waterloo Station. Yes, sir. Be familiar to you, won't it, sir? I mean, having been through the last one. Yes. It'll be familiar. - Thomas. - Sir? Go by way of Waterloo Bridge, will you? Waterloo Bridge, sir? We have plenty of time. Right, sir. Wait for me at the other end of the bridge. I'll walk across. THOMAS: Right, sir. MYRA: Here. Take this. ROY: Your good-luck charm? MYRA: Perhaps it'll bring you luck. I hope it will. I'll pray it will. ROY: That's wonderfully kind of you. MYRA: Do you think you'll remember me now? ROY: I think so. I think so. For the rest of my life. (SIREN WAILING IN DISTANCE) WOMAN 1: It was a siren. I heard it. WOMAN 2: You're dreaming. - I didn't hear a thing. WOMAN 1: Did you, Myra? Stop, listen. There it is again. Be quiet, please, all of you. - Was that an air-raid warning? - I'm afraid it was. We'll know in a minute. An air raid. I told you we'll be late. Madame will be furious. - We should worry about madame. WOMAN: Look. Look. MAN: Air raid! (SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY) - Where can we go? - The underground station. - Come on, girls. - To your right! To your right! - To your right. WOMAN: Hurry. Come on. (SIREN WAILING IN DISTANCE) Stupid bag. It always does this. - Thank you so much. - They're out to strafe this bridge. - We'd better get off it. - Oh, my lucky charm. You little fool. Are you tired of life? - I've had it for years. It brings me luck. - Such as air raids. (EXPLOSION IN DISTANCE) Do you think it'd be too unmilitary if we were to run? Not at all. Do you mind? MAN: News Weekly. Read about it. Paper. "Here, no pushing," he says. And I says, "You'd blooming well push if your hind legs were still outside." OLD WOMAN: I always run about, meseIf. As me old man says: "A moving target is harder to hit." - Ain't it? OLD MAN: Not haIf. (EXPLOSION) Blimey, 'Erman's a ruddy marksman, ain't he? - 'Erman? - Yes, 'Erman the German. (LAUGHING) Oh...! Oh, I'm... I'm sorry. There seems to be a certain amount of shoving. It is a crush, isn't it? (EXPLOSION) Mm, that one was close. We're safe here. There may be some space over there by the wall. - Shall we wiggle through? - All right. - Excuse us, please. - All right. Excuse me. Thank you very much. (INDISTINCT MUTTERING) - Better, eh? - Yes, thanks. Much better. - Looking for your friends? - Yes. Perhaps they took another entrance. - Do you mind? - Oh, no, no. I suppose I mustn't offer you one? Uh, no, thanks. You're at school, aren't you? (LAUGHS) Am I being funny? Oh, look, that's our school. Madame Kirowa's International Ballet. - International Ballet? - Mm-hm. Look here, you don't mean to say you're a dancer? - Yes. - A professional dancer? Uh, now and then, I wonder. And you mean you can pirouette and all that sort of thing? Certainly. I can do an entrechat six. - I beg your pardon? - I can cross my feet six times in midair. Nijinsky could do 10, but that only happens once in a century. Well, it must be good for the muscles of the... Must be good for the muscles. I should think a dancer's muscles would be like a strongman. Oh, not quite. That'd be dreadful. We try to combine slenderness with strength. Well, I've been dancing since I was 12. I don't think the muscles are overdeveloped. Oh, no. No, no. Not in your case. Of course, we have to train like athletes. Madame believes in rigid discipline. - You expect to get to the theater tonight? - Certainly. We don't go on till 10. - I wish I could be there. - Why don't you come? No, unfortunately, I have a colonel's dinner. It takes a lot of nerve to miss a colonel's dinner. - Are you on leave? - I have been. My home's in Scotland. Now you have to go back? To France, I mean. - Tomorrow. - Oh, I'm so sorry. This hateful war. Yes, I suppose it is. And yet there's, I don't know... ...a certain amount of excitement about it too. Around the corner of every second, the fascination of the unknown. We're facing it this instant. Oh, we face the unknown in peacetime too. - You're rather matter-of-fact, aren't you? - Yes. You're rather romantic, aren't you? (WHISTLE BLOWS) MAN: All clear! All clear! Well, there we are. I'm afraid it's over. Never enjoyed an air raid more. Shall we go now or wait for the next? Oh, it's very tempting, but I think we'd better go. Shall I carry that? No, no. I only drop it in emergencies. Well, I hope I'm around the next time it happens. It isn't very likely, is it? You go back to France and... - And you? - We may go to America. Oh, that does make it unlikely. I'm sorry. So am I. MAN: Read all about it. Read all about it. It's so late. I'm afraid I'll have to take a taxi. That may not be so simple. - I don't know any... - I wish I could have seen the... (BOTH CHUCKLE) - What were you going to say? - I wish I could have seen the ballet. I'm sure it would have been a pleasant memory in the trenches. What were you going to say? Oh, it's just that I don't know anyone at the front... ...and I'm afraid it'll bring it home to me now, knowing you. - Not that I really know you, of course. BOY: Here you are, governor. Thank you very much. I hope you get back safe and sound. Thank you. Here... ...take this. ROY: Your good-luck charm? Perhaps it'll bring you luck. I hope it does. Oh, now, look here. I can't take it. It means so much to you. You'd better have it. I was beginning to rely on it too much. Well, that's wonderfully kind of you. Olympic Theatre, please. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. (ORCHESTRA PLAYING "SWAN LAKE, OP. 20") - Kitty, he's here. - Who? Oh, the man in the underground? I don't understand. He said he couldn't come. - I suppose he just came to see the show. - You don't suppose anything of the kind. - You said he had to go to a colonel's dinner. - It's not what I said. It's what he said. (APPLAUSE) He's nice, isn't he? He's a bit of all right. Must have ditched the colonel. Think he'll come backstage? What'll madame say? We must watch and pray. Oh, girls. Girls, girls. Please. Please do be quiet. You know how madame hates noise. Shh! Shh, shh! Maureen. What is pas de bourre? A pas de bourre is a progression on points by a sequence of very small, even steps. If you know it, why don't you do it during the performance? Elsa. Your arabesques were jumpy. They were positively epileptic. Really, I was concerned for you. Ana. Show the young ladies, please, how to do an entrechat quatre. And may I ask, why didn't you do it that way for the audience? They also have some rights, you know. The performance tonight was disgraceful. We are playing for the moment in a variety theater but... (KNOCKING ON DOOR) Kitty. But that doesn't mean you should work with less precision... ...than performing seals, which precede you. You don't honor the ballet by your presence in it. The ballet honors you. Are there questions? Hm. - Yes, madame? - The note, Kitty. The note that was handed to you. Oh, well, it... It's just from an old friend, a man I used to know in a show. I don't need to be reminded that you were a chorus girl in a revue. - Your behavior... - Madame. - Myra. - No, Kitty. It's for me, madame. Then you may read it. Aloud, please. - Madame, I... - Read it, please. (SIGHS) "As you see, I cannot bear to spend my last evening with my colonel after all. Please have supper with me. Your friend of the shelter. P.S. I am sure you will because I have a good-luck charm... ...which has already changed my luck." - And the signature? - There isn't one. And if there were one, what would it be? I don't know. I only know he's an officer. Indeed? I must emphasize that if you want supper parties, officers and delights... ...you shouldn't be here with me but in other occupation. Lydia, paper, please. A war is no excuse for indecorum. Write, please. "Dear sir." What's his rank? Captain. "Dear captain." - Here you are, sir. - Oh, thank you. Thank you, sir. No-go, sir? No, I'm afraid not. Oh, captain. Captain. Wait a minute. I'm Kitty, Myra's friend. Where do you want to meet her? What? Myra? - Oh, how do you do? - I do very well, thank you. - But where do you want to meet her? - Well, l... But she, uh, she refused. Oh, take no notice. The old dragon made her write that. - She'll come after all? - Name the place. - Yes, does she know the Candlelight Club? - No, but I do. - Good, then. I'll be there in an hour, say? - An hour. Look here. I hope I'm doing the right thing. Myra's just a sweet child. You can see that, can't you? I can see that, Kitty. Bye-bye, captain. (LAUGHS) MYRA: Hello. - Oh, hello. I'm delighted. I was afraid Kitty had directed you to the wrong place. Oh, no, but your note was read out before the whole class. Were you embarrassed? Yes, and so would you have been. Ha, ha, I dare say. I'm afraid I've made it difficult for you. Well, you gave up the colonel, so I expect I made it difficult for you too. Yes, you did, but I have my reward. It was wonderful of you to come. - Shall we go in? - All right. Excuse me. How nice you look. Thank you. (ROY CHUCKLES) What do dancers eat? Oh, dull things mostly. Nutritious yet not fattening. Oh, no, not tonight. What could you suggest that would be particularly rich and indigestible? - The grouse is very nice, sir. - Mm-hm. And wine. It isn't against the rules for a dancer to drink a little light wine, is it? - Tonight... - Good. Number 40, please. Number 40, sir. - Ah, the ballet was beautiful. - Madame didn't think so. Well, experts never know. It takes outsiders to know. - And I tell you it was beautiful. - That certainly proves you're an outsider. Are you glad to see me again? Yes. I sense a reservation. - Well, I suppose there is one. - What? Why? What's the good of it? You're a strange girl, aren't you? What's the good of anything? - What's the good of living? - That's a question too. Now wait a minute. I'm not going to let you get away with that. The wonderful thing about living is that this sort of thing can happen. In the shadow of a death raid, I can meet you and feel more intensely alive... ...than walking around in peacetime, taking my life for granted. It's a high price to pay for it. - I don't think so. - I do. Do people have to kill each other to give them a heightened sense of life? That's got nothing to do with people killing each other. Either you're excited about life or you're not. You know, I've never been able to wait for the future. When I was very young, a child in fact, I climbed to the top of a high tree... ...stood like a diver, and announced to my horrified governess: "Now I shall take a leap into the future," and jumped. - I was in the hospital for two months. - Ha. Let the future catch up with you more slowly. Oh, no, no, never. Temperament. I can't help it. If we'd met in ordinary times in an ordinary way, we'd just about... ...be telling each other what schools we went to. We're much further along, don't you think? Are we? You know we are. - Oh, I'm too excited to eat. Let's dance. - All right. (BAND PLAYING "LONG WAY TO TIPPERARY") - To you. - Thank you. To us. Still don't get it. Not quite. What? Your face. It's all youth, all beauty. What is it you still don't get? You know, when I left you this afternoon, I couldn't remember what you looked like. I thought, "Was she pretty? Was she ugly? What was she like?" I couldn't remember. I had to get to that theater tonight to see what you looked like. And do you think you'll remember me now? I think so. I think so. For the rest of my life. But what is it about me you still don't get? (VIOLINS PLAY FANFARE) Ladies and gentlemen, we now come to the last dance of the evening. I hope you'll enjoy the farewell waltz. I'll tell you later. Let's dance now. What's it mean, these candles? You'll find out. (BAND PLAYING "AULD LANG SYNE") I'll write to you. Will you answer? Of course. Wonderful evening, wasn't it? Yes. Thank you very much. When I come back, we'Il... We'll go there again. - Yes. - That'll be our place. That's where we'll always recapture this evening. Do you think we'll ever see each other again? I think it's doubtful, don't you? Yes, I suppose it is. What was it you started to tell me in the restaurant... ...that you didn't understand about me? Heh. No use going into it now. No, but tell me, please. I'd like to know. Well, it struck me as curious ever since I met you... ...you know, from that very early moment ages ago... ...that you're so young, so lovely and so defeatist. I mean, you don't seem to expect much from life. Well, aren't I right? For instance, I met you... ...I liked you... ...and now so soon we have to part... ...and perhaps we'll never see each other again. You can conceive that, then, our never seeing each other again? Yes, I can. - This is where you live? - Yes. Well, nothing to do about it, is there? Nothing except to say goodbye. I suppose so. Goodbye. Goodbye, Myra, dear. Goodbye, Roy. - Keep well. - Yes, you too. Keep well. (CHUCKLES) Nothing can happen to me. Your lucky charm will see to that. I hope it will. I'll pray it will. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. Please leave me first. All right. Oh, I shall have to get this catch mended. KITTY: Well, I've been telling you. It broke open twice yesterday. Oh, Kitty, what time is it? It's, uh, haIf past 11. Oh. (KNOCKING ON DOOR) GIRLS: Good morning, madame. - Good morning. - I came to congratulate you, Myra. - On what, madame? On being up. Considering that you didn't go to bed until 4, it's remarkable. I have the feeling your performance tonight will give the effect of sleepwalking. Well, it's the first time Myra's been out, madame. When I made you send the note to the military gentleman last night... ...it was you I was trying to protect. I am fond of the girls who work for me. - I don't want them to be camp followers. - You don't know him... ...or you wouldn't say that. - Can't we have any private lives at all? Not when it hurts your public life at the theater. I'm happy that he didn't stay here a week. Otherwise he would have ruined six performances instead of one. If such a thing should happen again with you... ...or any of the others, it means instant dismissal. I will see you at the theater tonight... ...if it's not too much trouble. Oh, why is she so cruel and hateful? KITTY: Oh, the old broomstick. She talks to us all like that. Never mind. - She spoils everything. - Oh, rubbish. You're upset and tired. Why don't you go back to bed? There's no rehearsal today. No, I'm not tired. Horrible morning for the channel crossing. I suppose he's gone now. Yep, suppose so. Kitty. Kitty, look. He's here. Look. KITTY: Good heavens, he deserted. MYRA: He's here. He hasn't gone. KITTY: He'll be court-martialed for this. Oh, I've gotta go. Gotta go. Now, calm down, will you? I can't stand this excitement now. - You see him, don't you? - If that's his ghost, don't bring him up. Get away from that window. He'll see you in your slip. Kitty, come on, help me. Where's my hat? Oh, why wasn't I dressed? Oh! Oh, Kitty, Kitty. Come on. Oh, Kitty, what if l...? What'll he...? Do you suppose...? Oh, dear. Oh, Kitty, what do you think? Oh, Kitty. - Oh, there. Do I look all right? - Yes, you look all right. - You'd look better with a dress on. - Oh, yes. - Come on, now. - Hurry. A little lower. Myra, stop it. Oh, come on. Goodness, I don't know what I'm doing. I must see him. Oh, dear. These stupid buttons. Oh, Kitty, I just want to... I just want to... Oh, Kitty, he came back. I was beginning to think... But he didn't. He came back. Oh! Is he still there? - He is. He is. - Hey, wait a minute. Wait a minute. I'll get you a mackintosh. Your umbrella's in the corner there. Here, put this on. Now, I'm going to go first. You don't want to run into madame on the way down. Wait a minute. All clear. And please tell him no more false alarms. I can't stand the excitement. - Hello. - Hello. Nice of you to come and see me. Not at all. You didn't go. Couldn't. Mines in the channel. Forty-eight hours' leave. Oh, isn't that wonderful? Yes. I have two whole days. I thought about you all last night, couldn't sleep a wink. - You managed to remember me at last? - Yes, barely managed. Myra, what do you think we're going to do today? - Well, l... - You won't have time for that. - For what? - For hesitating. No more hesitating. - No? - No. - What am I going to do instead? - You're going to get married. - Roy, you must be mad. - I know it. Marvelous sensation. - Oh, Roy, do be sensible. - Not me. But you don't know me. I'll discover you. Spend the rest of my life doing it. This is wartime. It's because you're leaving so soon. Because you feel that you must spend the whole of your life in 48 hours. We're going to be married. It's you. It'll never be anyone else. But how can you tell that? Listen. None of your quibbling, your questioning. None of your doubts. This is positive, you see? This is affirmative, you see? This is final, you see? You're going to marry me, you see? I see. (WHISTLES) What's the matter, darling? - Where are we going? - To announce our engagement. To the barracks. Armour Square. Now, Myra, I wanna give you a picture of what you're in for. - All right. - I have to acquaint you with certain facts. In the first place, my dear young lady, I am a captain in the Rendleshire Fusiliers. - Are you impressed? - Very much. A captain in the Rendleshire Fusiliers cannot marry casually. It requires immense preparation, formality, etiquette. - I see it does. - It's an elaborate ritual. - Is it? - Mm-hm. For example... ...a captain in the Rendleshire Fusiliers has to get the consent of his colonel. - Is that difficult? - Well, it might or it might not be. - I feel it's going to be difficult. - A great deal depends upon the petitioner. On the charm of the petitioner. On his ardor, on his eloquence. - Myra, look at me. - Yes, captain. Can you doubt the outcome? You are very conceited, captain. You are quite mad, captain. You are reckless and headstrong and... And I adore you, captain. Now, sit here and don't speak to strangers. I'll be right back. - Myra. - So soon? No, I haven't seen him yet. I forgot something very important, indispensable. - What? - Your vital statistics. - Oh, I'm afraid I mislaid them. - I'll dig them up. Now, then, I assume you were born. Where? - Birmingham. - When? Uh, June 9th, 1895. - Father's profession? - Schoolmaster. - Parents living? - No. Ah. Uh, let's see. What else? Oh, yes. What's your last name? Oh, Roy. Lester. It's lucky I thought of that. That's vital. - Goodbye, Miss Lester. - Goodbye. I'll be just a second. MAN: I suppose it is, as a matter of fact, if it works out that way. Then you have to test the thing before you get to any particular point... Excuse me, sir. - Yes, what is it, Cronin? - May I see you privately, sir? - I am at lunch. - It's extremely important, sir. You held us up last night waiting for you. Now you interrupt my lunch. It's all part of the same thing, sir. (SIGHS) Very well. Back in a minute. I'm sorry, but I think you'll understand. I hope you'll understand. Do you mind giving me some sort of a clue? I'm sorry about not turning up for your dinner last night... ...but you see, colonel... Well, whatever it is, I hope you straighten it out before I get chronic indigestion. Sit down. I'd rather stand, if you don't mind, sir. I'm in a hurry. The fact is, colonel... The fact... - The fact... - What is the fact? With your permission, sir, if you don't mind, I'd like to get married this afternoon. Oh. And who is the bride-to-be, may I ask? Her name is Myra Lester. I have her vital statistics. Oh. Sit down. Have you known her long? Long enough to be absolutely sure, sir. - Has she been presented at court? - I believe not, sir. But she is eligible for presentation, I presume? Cronin, you're leaving for the front tomorrow. Are you sure that hasn't a good deal to do with your haste? I wanna marry her before I leave... ...so she can stay with my mother until I get back. I see. Well, Cronin, this... - This is a good deal of responsibility. - I know, sir. And a responsibility that I cannot assume by myseIf. I wish you'd try, sir. Sorry, but I'll have to ask you to get the consent of His Grace... ...the colonel in chief. - I see. As he is your relative, he can inquire more closely into this than I can. However, if you get his consent, you have mine. Thank you, sir. And I hope your future engagements will not take place during mealtimes. I'll try, sir. - Good luck. - Thank you, sir. - Revelstoke House, Belrose Square. - Yes, sir. Captain Cronin, Your Grace. - Ah, my boy, I'm glad to see you. ROY: Thank you, sir. - Very glad indeed. How are you? - Very well, sir. - When do you go back? - Day after tomorrow. For that push at Cambrai, I expect. - I hope so, sir. - Sit down. - Thank you. - Had a nice leave? - Wonderful. - Good, good. You deserve it. Well, my boy, is there anything I can do for you? - Yes, sir. - What is it? Well, I'd like your consent, sir, to my marriage. Your marriage? (LAUGHS) - Well, who's the girl? - Miss Myra Lester. Lester. Lester. Surrey? No, Birmingham. Birmingham, oh. Lester. - Do I know them? - No, but I can remedy that, sir. - Does your mother know her? - No, but she will. At least Myra. - Her parents are dead, sir. She's all alone. - Dear, dear, dear, dear. Hm. Well... ...what does she do? - She's a dancer. A dancer? Yes, sir. She's, uh... She's terribly nice, sir. A dancer. You know, Roy... You know, Roy... ...I like dancers. Well, thank you, sir. I mean, I don't blame you. Naturally. In my time, you understand, in my time... Of course, sir. When I was your age, I was in love with a dancer. I wanted to marry her... ...but she wouldn't. (BOTH LAUGH) So if she'd accepted me, she'd have been your aunt. - That would have been delightful. - Look here, my boy. I don't mind telling you I'm very proud of your war record. Thank you, sir. Now, you know what you're doing, I suppose. Yes, sir. You'll be proud of her too, sir. I'm sure. I don't necessarily believe in what they call correct marriages. Seen too many of them turn out badly. - Well, good luck, my boy. And bless you. - Thank you, sir. - I'll never forget this. Neither will she. - That's all right. - Bring her to see me on your next leave. - I shall. - Fine fellow. - Thank you again, sir. (CHUCKLES) A dancer, eh? Miss Lester, His Grace has consented to the marriage of Captain Roy Cronin... ...of the Rendleshire Fusiliers to Myra Lester of Birmingham, Warwickshire, England. - No family opposition? - Not a speck. Disappointed? Oh, it's too easy. I'm frightened. Ha-ha-ha, defeatist. DRIVER: Where to, sir? - Uh, to Bond Street. Yes, sir. - Bond Street? - To Bond Street for a ring. A simple ring. I don't wanna spoil you straight off. Then to the florist. You deserve a posy. Then to St. Matthew's Church. - St. Matthew's? Really? - Of course St. Matthew's. They have the proper tradition. Swift, regimental marriages. We walk in comparative strangers, we walk out comparative friends. (BOTH LAUGH) The door beyond leads to the church, sir. You'll find the vicar at choir practice. Thank you. - Well, darling? - Oh, Roy. Shall we face it? It's been so quick. Are you quite, quite sure? Myra, I was never so sure of anything in my life. In the moment you left me after the air raid, I knew I must find you again quickly. I've found you and I'll never let you go. Does that answer you? Wait here a moment. (CHOIR SINGING) This is Miss Lester. - How do you do? - How do you do? I'm sorry to disappoint you, Miss Lester... ...but I'm afraid it's impossible for me to marry you now. No doubt you forget that according to the law... ...no marriages can take place after 3:00. I explained to the vicar, Myra, that this is an emergency... ...that we thought during wartime, something could be managed. Isn't there anything you can do? We'd be most grateful. Oh, I'd like to help you, but unfortunately that is the law. However, if you'll come tomorrow morning at 11:00... ...I shall be most happy to perform the ceremony for you. But we have so little time. Well, it's only a few hours. It just means we'll have to be engaged... ...for a whole day. VICAR: Yes. I don't believe in long engagements. Do you, vicar? Not when the parties are elderly. But I think in your case, it can do no harm. Then I shall expect you tomorrow at 11? - We'll be here. - At 11 precisely, on the stroke of the hour. I shall be punctual. - Goodbye. Thank you very much. - Goodbye, Miss Lester. - Goodbye, sir. - Goodbye. Where is Myra? It's almost 8. We've got to go to the theater. - I tell you, I tremble for the poor girl. - Oh, you're always trembling. Maybe she went directly to the theater. That's right. She's probably waiting for us. I hope so. Well, where have you been? I've been worried to death. I thought you were with the boyfriend, but he phoned. MYRA: Oh, did he? I wonder why. He had to go back to the barracks. I went shopping. Hey, what's happened to you? Whose dress is that? - It's mine. - Yours? Yes. I spent my last penny on it. - Are you crazy? - Yes, quite, quite. And I bought a hat, a lovely hat. And shoes and a bag and then gloves and... Oh, isn't it a dream, Kitty? It's... It's my wedding dress. What? - Oh, Myra, you don't mean that? - Yes. I'm going to be married. Oh, darling, come here and let me hug you. - It's wonderful. - When? When? How? Tomorrow morning at St. Matthew's Church. Oh, Kitty, I'm so madly happy. Oh, darling, I can't believe it. Neither can I. It's silly. I'm crying. I've been crying all day. Oh, it's unbelievable. Things like this just don't happen. It's so wonderful. Oh, what a joke on madame. WOMAN: Kitty, are you coming? Yes, all right. Wait a second. Uh, you're coming to the theater, aren't you? - I wouldn't let madame down for anything. - Then we'd better hurry. Come on. Oh, girls. Girls. Hey, Lydia. Girls. Girls, what do you think? Myra's going to be married. ALL: Married? (EXCITED CHATTERING) May I tell them? You don't mind? Darling, you seem to have done it. WOMAN 1: Tell us about him. - When will it be? - Tomorrow morning. WOMAN 2: What's his name? - Roy Cronin. Well, Mrs. Cronin, I declare. - Maybe it'll break out with the rest of us. - Like the flu. I'm so happy for you, Myra. Oh, Vi, you are a darling. You're all so sweet. I feel like crying too. But we haven't got time. Come on, girls. We're late for the theater. Come on, girls. Miss Myra, you're wanted on the telephone. Thank you. Hello. Yes. What? Oh, no. When? Oh, that's terrible. Can't they give you one more day? You have to...? Oh, of course, I'll come at once. I love you. KITTY: What is it? - The orders have been changed. He's going tonight. The train leaves in 25 minutes. I'm going to see him off. - Going where? - To Waterloo Station. You can't. You won't be back for the show. - Madame will... - Sorry. Myra, please. She'd never forgive you, never. Don't do it, Myra. I may never see him again. (WHISTLE BLOWS) She's just going, sir. Excuse me. Myra! - Roy! - Myra! Roy! (DOOR OPENS) KITTY: Myra. - Myra, darling. - Did he leave? Did you talk to him? - Didn't you see him at all? - Just caught a glimpse of him. Oh, what a shame. I couldn't get a taxi and they told me the wrong platform. Oh, he'll be back. It'll be all right, Myra. The war can't last forever. (DOOR OPENS) Good evening, Myra. It's very condescending of you to come here at all. She's very unhappy, madame. Her fianc was called to the front. I'm not interest in troop movements. - She was to be married in the morning. - Nor in social events. Well, the whole world doesn't begin and end with a ballet. My world does. And while you are with me, so must yours. That prescription no longer applies to Myra. Oh, don't sack her, madame. I warned you. You are dismissed. - I never heard of such unreasonable... - Be careful, Kitty. - No, I won't. - Oh, Kitty. I'm fed up with her. I've been wanting to tell her for years. Now I'm going to tell you. And if you don't like it, you can lump it. I'm sick of you and your tyranny. You treat us like a lot of slaves and call it discipline. It isn't that. It's just that you enjoy bullying us. - Lydia. - Yes, madame? Rehearsal tomorrow at 11. With two understudies. Good night. Well, no more ballet for me. I'm sick of being highbrow with my feet. You and I, ducky, are going to get into a revue. All we've got to do is to get some manager to put one on. That ought to be simple. - Kitty. - Yes? - Do you think? - Occasionally. What? Do you think he'll write? (LAUGHS) Hello. I'm back and I didn't get the job. Oh, Kitty, you startled me. KITTY: Did I? Sorry. Well, now that I'm all settled, how about you? Oh, no luck. There's nothing there. It's no use looking. Well, I had two letters last week. - I didn't really expect any. - Uh-huh. - How about the dress shop? - Experience needed. - The tearoom? - Filled. Naturally. But they put me on the waiting list. That's a comfort, isn't it? Well, Myra, we're a couple of howling successes. - Sitting on top of the world, aren't we? - You're in a nice mood, aren't you? No wonder, sitting in the dark, feeling sorry for yourseIf. If I don't feel sorry for myseIf, who will? Trouble with you is, you're hungry. Give me your hand. You'll feel better when you've had something to eat. Myra. Yes, Kitty? You're probably sick of hearing this but, honestly, why don't you let Roy know? - That we're out of work? - That we're broke. Flat broke. Down to our last tin. Oh, he'd worry. Well, better for him to worry than for us to starve. Kitty, we're not starving. Nobody starves. You mean, people who starve don't live to tell about it. I don't know what we're going to do. We can't get jobs in a show, we can't get them anywhere else. If madame were still here, I'd go to her, pride or no pride... ...but as it is, there's nobody. Myra... ...I'm frightened. I've never been frightened before. I don't like it. Oh, Kitty. Perhaps it's seIfish of me not to let Roy know... ...but I've got a stupid sort of pride about it. Let me wait a little while. Just a little while longer. Something must turn up, and if it doesn't, well... (KNOCKING ON DOOR) It's Mrs. Bassett for the rent. - Remember, you're rehearsing. - Oh, yes, that's right. - Miss Lester? - I'm Miss Lester. For you, Miss Lester. - Thank you. - Quite all right, miss. Kitty. Flowers. - I can't imagine. - Here, let's see. Put them down here. Oh, gosh. Oh, aren't they lovely? Who do you suppose? Kitty, it's Roy. It's his handwriting. Sixteen, 18, 24... Oh. They must have cost a pound at least. Oh, enough to buy us food for a whole week. "One of my men got leave. You'll be receiving these through him. With them I send you all my..." We, uh... We could sell them to the florist at the corner and buy ourselves a real meal. But I don't think you'd favor the idea. No. Oh, Kitty. His mother's coming here. To London? Yes, listen. "My mother is snatching a few days... ...from her Red Cross work and is coming to town to see you. I know you'll get on well with her. She's very nice. In fact, she's quite like me." Ha. Oh, Kitty, what'll I do? I can't have her here. Why not? Let's give her a little party and open up the last tin. I'll suggest meeting her somewhere. For tea, perhaps. Oh, but, Kitty, imagine. His mother. I'm awfully nervous at meeting her. I wonder... What, you funny love-struck infant? I wonder if she'll like me. Well, she better, or we won't invite her at all. - Myra, you're trembling. - Kitty, don't you see... ...that meeting her would be like seeing Roy again. You've been such a darling to me. And now perhaps I'll be able to repay you. You know... ...I have a feeling that from now on... ...everything's going to take a turn for the better. I'm sure it is. - One? - No, there'll be another one later. - Is there a table by the window? - I think so. Oh, no, thank you. I'll wait for my friend. She's Lady Margaret Cronin and I'm Miss Lester. If she should ask for me, direct her to me here. Certainly. What time is it, please? - It's 10 minutes to 5, miss. - Thank you. - Your friend seems to be held up. - Yes. Sure you wouldn't like a cup of tea? No, thank you. I'm sure she'll be here any minute. - Care to look at the evening paper? - Oh, thank you. Feeling better, miss? Here, take another sip. Feel faint, don't you? You did give us a fright. Wouldn't you like to go to the restroom... ...and lie down a bit? - No, l... I'd rather stay here, if you don't mind. Better take another drop of this, then. Better? Sure? Yes, I'll be all right. Sit quiet and rest. And if your friend doesn't turn up, we'll call a taxi. Are you Miss Lester? Yes. I'm Margaret Cronin, Roy's mother. I'm afraid I've kept you waiting. Oh, I'm terribly sorry. My train was haIf an hour late. You know how it is these days. But I've come straight from Scotland to keep this appointment... ...so I do hope you'll forgive me. What shall we have? Tea? Little cakes? No. No, thank you. I don't think so. I can't stay very long. Oh. Tea for one, then. And some thin toast. I do hope you're not going to run off at once. I've wanted so much to meet you, but I've been so terribly busy. I've been turning an old country place into a rest home for wounded men. By the way, I telephoned you from Scotland to the hotel... ...where Roy told me you were staying. They said you'd gone. I tried to get in touch with you through the ballet... ...but they said it had gone to America. I was about to wire Roy... ...when your note came. - I have my mail forwarded. There... There are reasons. Oh, my dear, I didn't mean to pry. Forgive me, my dear, but you're not afraid of me, are you? I know it is a bit of an ordeal meeting one's future in-laws. I remember how I dreaded it. But I'm not very terrifying, am I? I know we're going to be good friends. I feel that I know you already through Roy's letters. I want to write him... ...and tell him that you and I have met and that we like each other very much. - May I write him that? - Yes, yes, of course. I suppose there are things you want to know about Roy I could tell you. There are things about him you could tell me. Why don't they bring your tea? They're very slow. Shall I call the waitress? Don't bother. I'm in no hurry. Would you rather that I didn't speak to you about Roy? No. No. Why should you think that? But what is there to say? Forgive me, my dear, but are you quite well? Yes, yes, of course. I had a drink, that's all. It made me feel funny. Queer. What's it like in Scotland? I have never been there. It always sounds so quaint, you know, the heather and the peat. (LAUGHS) Peat comes from Ireland, doesn't it? I've never been there either. Why do you stare at me like that? I'm trying to see you as Roy sees you. Myra, I want you to remember that I tried to be your friend. I've come because Roy wanted me to come and because I wished to. Perhaps we'll try again someday. Perhaps on Roy's next leave, he'll bring you to the country. Goodbye, Myra. The lady is leaving, miss? Myra? Myra. WOMAN: Who is it? - Has Miss Lester gone out, Mrs. Clarke? - What...? What is it? - Where's Miss Lester? How should I know? She went out. - When? - About an hour ago. You shouldn't have let her. She's not well enough to go out, and a night like this too. This is a lodging house, Miss Meredith, not a nursing home. Myra, where have you been? Whatever made you go out on a night like this? You went and got caught in the rain too. Now, you come on upstairs and get into bed. We spend months trying to build you up and you go and do a silly thing like this. I can't trust you out of my sight. Now, you get those things off. Double-quick time too. I'll fix you a hot-water bottle. - Kitty. - Yes? How did the show go tonight? Oh, same as usual. Was it a good house? So-so. Why? I went to the theater. I thought I'd surprise you by calling for you. Oh, yes... (SIGHS) See, Myra, I didn't want to worry you. I'm in a different sort of a show than the one I said I was in. A cheaper sort of a show, so it's... Kitty, you haven't got a job at all. You never did have one. How have we been living? What difference does it make as long as we live? Where's the money coming from? Where are you getting it? Where do you think I've been getting it? I tried to keep it from you but... Well, you know now. You did it for me. No, I didn't. I'd have done it anyhow. (SPEAKING IN FRENCH) No jobs. No boys who want to marry you. Only men who wanna kill a few hours because they know it may be their last. Kitty, you did it for me to buy me food and medicine. I'd sooner have died. No, no, you wouldn't. You think you would, but you wouldn't. I thought of that... ...but I wasn't brave enough. I wanted to go on living. Heaven knows why, but I did, and so would you. We're young and it's good to live. Even the life I'm leading. Though, God knows it... I've heard them call it the easiest way. I wonder who ever thought up that little phrase. I know one thing. It couldn't have been a woman. I suppose you think... ...I'm dirt. Oh, Kitty. (SOBBING) MAN: Hello. A bit of weather we had this evening, didn't we? It's cleared up though, nicely after all. How about a little stroll? How's luck? No such thing. - How's Kitty? - Oh, about the same as me. Ah, nowadays, there don't seem to be no luck for nobody. Oh, well. Better days coming, so the song says. - I hope so. Toodle-oo. - Bye-bye. Hello, Myra. How's luck? I'm not exactly prepared to retire yet. Well, here they come. - Cheerio. - Cheerio. - Welcome home. - Thanks, ducky. ROY: Myra! Myra! Myra. Myra, I can't believe it. It is you, isn't it? - It's really you. - Oh, Roy. It's really you. Oh, darling, let me look at you. I'm not dreaming, am I? But think of finding you here, waiting for me. Why, it's a miracle. Roy, you... You're alive. The months I've waited for this moment. I'd begun to think it would never come. How'd you know I was coming? Did you telephone Mother? Oh, now, darling, none of that. Chin up. Where's your nerve? It's over, darling. It's all over. And we're together for always. Oh, Roy. You're alive. Yes, extravagantly. (SOBS) Oh, my poor darling. Come on. We'll go sit down. Oh, darling, don't cry. It's a happy ending. Have you missed me? Did you think I was...? Didn't you know I was indestructible? How could I die when we're engaged? Did you think I'd break our engagement? Oh, you don't know me, young woman. No, I was wounded and somehow lost my identification disk. It's a long story. I'll tell you someday. I was in a German prison camp for a year. Head wound. Pretty nearly signed off, but I got out at last and went to Switzerland. Mother came over, of course, mines or no mines. And then I heard that she'd lost touch with you. I almost lost my mind. What happened? Did she find you? - Did you get in touch with her? - No. - Then you didn't know I was coming? - No. What were you doing at the station? Were you looking for a friend? Yes. Well, I'm the friend you were looking for. Who was he? I insist upon knowing. Who was he? Oh, it was a girl. No one in particular. (ROY LAUGHS) It's a miracle that I ran into you like this... ...when you were waiting for no one in particular. Here we are, good strong tea. This will buck you up. Come on, drink this. I want to talk to you. I've got a thousand questions. What have you been up to? You got a job? Where is it? What does it pay? Not that it really matters because you're quitting it. This instant. I'm not going to let you out of my sight... ...not till we're married. You understand that? You've been through a lot, haven't you? It has been... - It's been... - Pretty tough, eh? And I wasn't there to help you. But that's all over now. I'm going to make it up to you. I'm going to make things easy for you. I never want to see you cry again... ...except with happiness. If only I'd known you were alive, that you were in the world. I'll never leave you again, darling. Never. Now, Miss Lester, I have a program. I'm a man with a program, a man of action. I'm phoning my mother that I found you and we're coming up on the evening train. Excuse me while I find a phone. Don't you move until I come back to you. - We'll be up on the nine-six. - I must speak to you. - There's something I must say. - Will you? Ha, ha, that'll be marvelous. Thanks, Mother. Goodbye. - Well, that's that. - Roy, you must listen to me. Myra, what is it? I can't go to the country with you. It's quite out of the question. - Why not? - Please don't ask me, but I simply can't. But I've got to ask and you've got to tell me. Oh, I look terrible, for one thing. I haven't any clothes and l... - Well, I really can't go anywhere. - Ha, ha. Oh, you little fool. Let me have a squint at you. I think you exaggerate. Now that I look at you, there's something in what you say. Well, Madame Cronin-to-be, we'll see what we can do. How would you like to be the smartest woman in London? No, Roy, I can't. Myra, darling. I'm afraid I've been stupid. Conceited and stupid. Because you've never been out of my thoughts... ...I took it for granted that it was the same with you. There's someone else, isn't there, Myra? After all, you thought me dead. There is someone else, isn't there? Don't be afraid. Tell me. Oh, Roy, of course there isn't anyone else. There couldn't be. I loved you. I've never loved anyone else. I never shall. That's the truth, Roy. That's all I wanted to know. Oh, darling, smile for a change. Have you forgotten how? That's a good girl. I can't believe I'm with you again. But you are. - Happy? - Yes. Personally, I'm delirious. Come on, we're going shopping. KITTY: Myra. Well, what's all this? Have you taken to shoplifting? Oh, Kitty, darling. Roy's alive. He's back. He's here. - Roy? - Mm-hm. - No. - Yes, he's back. We've been together the whole afternoon. He'll be here any minute. Kitty... ...he wants to marry me. - Oh, no. Such things don't happen. - It's true. Oh, Kitty, it's going to be so wonderful, for you too. Nothing will be too good for you when I'm Roy's wife. Oh, I know what you're thinking. I've been thinking too. You think that'd be dreadful of me, don't you? - Does he know? - No. Do you think you can get away with it? - You mean deceiving him? - Yes. Oh, I'm going to tell him. There are two sorts of people, Myra. Those who get the breaks and those who don't. Well, I'm getting the breaks now, and I'm not going to sink. You remember you once said that you wanted to live? Well, I want to live. This is my chance for life and I won't let him go. He's so kind, Kitty, so sweet and clean and wonderful. I'll devote myseIf to him. After all, it's his happiness too, Kitty. He... He loves me. He's waited for me. And in my soul, I've waited for him. Tell me I can go to him. Please, Kitty. (SIGHS) Guess there are no rules, Myra... ...for what you feel... ...and what he feels. Kitty. After all, if he's... ...mad enough about you, it may make up for everything. It must. It must. Well, try it. Go to him. Oh, Kitty. The ancestral acres. Shall I point out the things we're proudest of... ...no matter how boring? - Oh, it's beautiful. Simply beautiful. Mother will take you all over. You mustn't tell her I showed you. See it first with her. - Be enthusiastic too. - That won't be difficult. It must be wonderful to spend one's childhood in a place like this. Yes, it's great when you're young. - When you're really young. - Oh, Roy. Do you think of yourseIf as old? No one who's been in this war is young. No, that's true. Remember Longfellow's line? " The thoughts of youth are long, long thoughts. " - Myra. - Yes, Roy? We're awfully good together, don't you think? R.S.V.P. I mean, that was a question. It requires an answer. Yes or no? Yes. Your answer is correct. Our home, darling. - Mother. - Oh! Myra, I'm so glad to see you again, my dear. Isn't it wonderful, Roy finding you so quickly? - I believe there's providence in it. ROY: I'm sure of it. You're very kind, Lady Margaret. Roy, I do hope you haven't shown Myra anything. I want to show her round myseIf. - I didn't show her a thing. MARGARET: Good. Come. Oh, I'm so happy. - Hello, Barnes. - Oh, Mr. Roy, do excuse me. I've been waiting all afternoon for the dogcart, and then I missed it. Just at the crucial moment, as you might say. I missed my welcoming committee. Wanted to impress Miss Lester. However, this is my future wife, Barnes. Myra, this is Barnes. - How do you do? - How do you do? Brought me up from a baby. - Tell you all about it in detail. - I'd love to hear about it. Well, he gave us an awful lot of trouble, Miss Lester. He wasn't what you would call a good child... ...but you couldn't resist him. One day he jumped from a treetop. ROY: I've told her about that, Barnes. You fish up something new. - Yes, sir. ROY: Come, Mother. - What about showing Myra to her room? - Oh, Roy, I forgot. - I'm afraid we're going to be invaded. - Invaded? The neighbors. I did my best to spare you... ...but the whole countryside is coming in tonight to see you and your bride. Ha, ha, oh, poor Myra. She's going to see some wonderful types. (ALL LAUGH) (BAND PLAYING WALTZ) They do look well together, don't they? She's a lovely girl. Perfectly lovely. I suppose very soon... ...these two young people will be paying me a professional visit. Tomorrow morning, I expect. Roy's madly in love. - Jealous? - A little. - But you like her, don't you? - Very much. More every minute. She dances beautifully, doesn't she? Well, that's her job. Those Cronin men, they're always attracted by girls who undress in public. Why don't you try it, Viola? Oh, I haven't the nerve. I'm not quite sure that I've got the figure. (GIRLS LAUGH) All I can say is, there are plenty of charming girls... ...of good family in the county who would have jumped at Roy... ...and I don't mean my niece, Victoria. I wonder if she can ride. Who's ever heard of her? Has anyone ever seen her dance? Well, evidently, Roy's seen her and evidently liked it. You'll notice the duke isn't here. Evidently, the duke doesn't like it. - Happy? - Yes. - Completely? - Yes. - Ecstatically? - Yes. - No doubts? - No. - No reservations? - No. - No defeatism? - No. Darling, every once in a while, I see fear in your eyes. Why? Oh, life's been hard for you, I know that. You've had to struggle and endure privation, but that's all over now. You're safe now. Don't be afraid. You needn't be ever again. I love you. Oh, Roy, you're so good. You're so... Oh, darling, it's... - It's unreal, isn't it? - Yes. Shall we wake up suddenly and find it untrue? Roy, don't be defeatist. (ROY CHUCKLES) Rather like running the gauntlet, wasn't it, to dance in there? But you're a great success, darling. - Everyone's enchanted with you. - But they haven't met me yet. - You warm? - Yes, very. - Would you like a drink? - I'd love one. I'll get you some of Barnes' famous punch. Cool and innocent and deceptive. You sit right here. Don't move an eyelid till I come back. MYRA: I shall run off with the first strolling minstrel. - Darling. - Darling. COLONEL: Of course I'm here. I've come to see that young woman. Where is she? Where are you hiding her? This is Myra. Myra, this is my uncle, the source of those bellows you just heard. How do you do? So this is Myra, is it? I am very glad you came. - Why have you kept us apart? - Ha, ha. Now my troubles begin. Roy, you told me you were going to get Myra some punch. What about it? I knew it was too good to last. Darling. Come, my dear. Let's sit down. You gave me 10 of the most anxious moments of my life. Did I? When? When I was waiting in a cab while Roy was inside... ...asking your permission to marry me. Were you outside in the cab? Why didn't he bring you in? I don't suppose he dared. Quite right. Very shrewd of him. If he had, I'd never have given my consent. - I should have asked for you myseIf. - Ha, ha. - And I'd have said yes. - Ha-ha-ha. My dear... ...will you do me a favor? - Oh, I love to. Will you do me the honor to dance with me? Of course, but I'm afraid Roy will think we've eloped. - Well, maybe we will. - All right. Come along. I haven't been here for ages. Come on, my dear. Let's make an entrance. (UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING) You dance beautifully, my dear. And why not, indeed? - So do you. - I? Oh, no. COLONEL: Oh, dear. Oh, dear. Oh, dear. Ah! Well, that dance is the climax of my career. I can now retire permanently and write my memoirs. You're awfully kind. I shall always be grateful to you. Grateful? What are you talking about? Think I don't know why you came here and made a point of dancing with me... ...in front of all those people? - Point? Point? What point? You wanted to show them that you approved of me. You knew if you approved, they would. - Incidentally, I jolly well liked it. - Ha, ha. You're awfully nice. I do so want them to like me. I want to be a success because of Roy. Well, you know what these people are. They're good people, mind you. Kind people. But they're old-fashioned and rather limited in their social ideas. "What's good enough for AIfred the Great is good enough for me" sort of thing. (BOTH LAUGH) - You see that emblem? - Mm-hm. COLONEL: Broken lance. Our regimental badge. Roy's regiment too. Well, they think the only way to keep up the tradition is to lead a dull life... ...and marry one of themselves. They think of a dancer as someone a little racy, shall I say... ...to put it mildly. Ha-ha-ha! Too bad you can't live up to their idea, Myra, isn't it? Ha. It would be good fun, wouldn't it? Hm. Yes, it would. But Roy's instinct tells him what you are. My instinct tells me too. You're sound and good. That badge is never going to suffer at your hands. If I weren't sure of that... ...I wouldn't welcome you as I do now. ROY: Myra. Uncle, I've been more than generous, leaving you so long with Myra. - Longer would be foolhardy. - Yes. You'd better take her away... ...before she discovers that I'm the better man. (BOTH CHUCKLE) (BAND PLAYING "AULD LANG SYNE") Listen, Myra. I had them play it. Let's dance to it. Will you excuse us, sir? - Thank you. - For what? For what? Go and enjoy yourselves. Remember, darling, the Candlelight Club? It's forever ago, isn't it? And yet it's tonight. (KNOCKING ON DOOR) Come in. Do I disturb you? Uh, no. Please come in, Lady Margaret. I knocked very gently, so in case you were asleep, I shouldn't wake you. MYRA: Won't you sit down? - I thought you'd be awake. I said, "She's far too happy and excited to be asleep." Two things keep one up, great happiness or great misery. - Don't you think so? - Yes. I couldn't go to sleep either without getting something off my chest... ...as the Americans say. Are you sure you're not too tired? No, no, of course not. It's about our last meeting in London. That has preyed upon my mind ever since. Do you bear a grudge against me for that, Myra? Oh, no, Lady Margaret. I came with a prejudice... ...and when I saw you, you seemed strange to me. I thought you couldn't be, well, what I wanted Roy's wife to be. I've no excuse, except a mother's excuse for wanting an impossible ideal for her son. Can you forgive me? - But there's nothing to forgive. - When I got home the next day... ...I found the telegram telling me the dreadful news about Roy. And when I could think again, it suddenly struck me that you had known all the time. That you'd just seen his name in the paper... ...and that you hardly knew what you were saying. - Is that true? - Yes. Oh, you poor child. If I'd only known. I did my very best to find you, but you'd disappeared. And now I want to make it up to you in the future. I'm very happy about this marriage, Myra... ...and I know we're going to be wonderful friends. Forgive me for being sentimental. Good night, my daughter. Lady Margaret! Lady Margaret. - Lady Margaret. - Yes, Myra? I must speak to you. Why, of course, Myra. I can't marry Roy. Sit down quietly, dear, and tell me. I must go away. I should never have come here. I knew it was impossible... ...but I kept deceiving myseIf. I've got to go away. I must never see him again. My dear, why don't you tell me what it is? - I'm sure I can help you. - No one can help me. But, my dear, what can it be that is so terrible? Has there been someone else? Oh, Lady Margaret. You are naive. - Myra. - Yes. - Yes, yes. - Myra. That thought which is now in your mind... ...which you are telling yourseIf can't be true is true. - Myra. - Yes. Why didn't you tell him? I didn't have the courage. Oh, I can give you plenty of reasons. I was hungry. I was poor. I thought Roy was dead, but... I could make you understand, but it wouldn't help me. Oh. I don't know what to say. But it's my fault as much as yours for not having understood... ...for not having taken care of you. - Oh, don't be nice to me. If l... If I leave early in the morning... If I never see Roy again... ...would you promise me he'll never know? I couldn't bear to hurt him like that. Myra. Oh, let us wait until the morning. Let us think this over. Will you promise? I promise. Thank you. You've been so good. I wish I could have been all that you hoped. (ROY HUMMING) Myra. Why, you little gadabout. What are you doing prowling around at this hour? - You been with Mother? - Yes. Isn't she wonderful? Yes, she is. I knew I wouldn't sleep so I've been in the garden... ...confiding my luck to the stars. - Were they pleased? They seemed indifferent. They went on glittering, the little exhibitionists. (LAUGHS) Oh. - Ever see this before? - I think so. Here. But I gave it to you. It's yours. I think it'll be safer with you, just as I'll be. I dropped it in the garden a moment ago. I was frantic until I found it again. I think you'd better have it from now on because now that we're both... ...as they say, one, it really doesn't matter which one of us keeps it, does it? It's brought me luck. Now let it bring you luck. I'll keep it for you, Roy. - I'm tired, darling. - Yes, you look tired. - Been a strenuous day for you. - Yes. Good night, darling. Goodbye, darling. Ha, ha, why "goodbye" when it's only till morning? Because every parting from you... ...is like a little eternity. That's the way I feel too. - Goodbye. - Goodbye, little sentimentalist. ROY: Tomorrow, all day to ourselves. Yes, my love. Wait for me. Myra. Myra, it's Roy. - Myra. KITTY: What on earth's going...? - Oh, it's you. - Hello, Kitty. - Where's Myra? - She's not with you? - What are you talking about? - She left Scotland last night. - Without telling you? - She's not been here, then? Not since she walked out with you the other day. - Look here, can I come in? - Of course. I was just having a bite to eat. Sit down. What's happened? She left a note that she couldn't marry me. Was there any trouble with your family? No, no, no, none. It's incredible. I can't understand it at all. Last night we were together. She told me she was happy. - When did she leave? - The first train for London. - She must have arrived hours ago. - Well, she's not been here. Where is she? Kitty, there's something I haven't understood. I've felt it in the back of my mind since I came home. You know what it is. Tell me. Tell me. I suppose you better face it, Roy. I suppose she means for you never to see her again. - Why not? - I don't know! Don't ask me. What's in back of all this? If you don't tell me, I'll go to the police. - Oh, no. Don't go to the police. - Why shouldn't I? Roy, can you take it... ...no matter what you find out about her? - What are you hinting? - Answer me. Can you take it? No matter what I find out, it won't make any difference. I've got to find her. Well, come on, then. We'll look for her. - Hello, Kitty. - Have you seen Myra? - No. - Are you sure? See, I know every bit what comes in here, and Myra particularly. And when I tells you she ain't, she ain't. Oh, all right. Thanks. Why don't you and your gentleman sit down here for the fight? Seen Myra? No, I ain't seen her for about four days. Where has she gone, the Riviera? - If you see her, tell her I'm looking for her. - All right, I will, dearie. - Hey, Mack. - Hi, sister. - Have you seen Myra? - It's early for Myra. She don't usually come around till about midnight. All right, thanks. Roy, she don't seem to be anywhere. There's only one place we haven't tried. What place is that? Waterloo Station. Waterloo Station, driver. Well? Not anywhere? No. Nobody's seen her. - Oh, Roy, I'm scared. - Kitty. I'm scared, I tell you. Where is she? She... She couldn't go through with it. She was too honest. She said it was a chance to live. - A chance to live? - And that she'd never go back. That she'd never go back to the... You don't need to say it. I understand. Then... Then where is she? She's lost, Kitty. She's escaped us. And I'll always look for her. I'll never find her. Is that you, Myra? Hello. Heard you was married. - No. - That Kitty... ...she told me. Said you'd got off with some toff. I knew it was too good to be true. Yes. Oh, well, cheer up. Things can't be worse. Going down to the station? Oh, well. I'll be off on me Ionesome, then. Toodle-oo. (SCREECHING) MYRA: I loved you. I've never loved anyone else. I never shall. That's the truth, Roy. I never shall.
