Your daughter might only know English. Myra, I will pay you. My wife will just take my daughter to another place. I might not see her again. Sorry, Donald. Business is business! - Please, Myra. - Oh come on! Just give up your child. Besides, your wife is arrogant! You left the seminary just for her then what did she give you in return?! She left you! You know what, that chapter of your life should already be closed! It should already be a closed book! Mommy, phone call. It says it's about your uncle. I have an uncle? Do we have an uncle? He is your Uncle Lando. Is he dead? Look at him. He already has a coin on his eyes. He wears this on his head and he's not moving. So he's dead! Will you guys pay respect?! Come to think of it, I only read and watched things about him. Why? Who is he, by the way? He's an excellent writer! He has a lot of awards! The FAMAS awards, formerly known as the Maria Clara awards, he has lots of that! Wow. Is that true? YES! How do you know that? Because Donald doesn't do anything but watch movies. Auntie, look. It's so beautiful! You know what, when I was a kid then, I always watch his horror movies and oh boy, I get really scared! I couldn't sleep for three days! But I watch it again because it's amazing! I don't watch Tagalog movies. It's cheap! So I'm sure Uncle's works are cheap. Go on. Uncle might hear you. He's dead! The sense of hearing is the last thing that fades away from a dead person. Sorry, Uncle. Sorry. Why did you call us to come here? Will Uncle give us inheritance? You're the only relatives left of Mang Lando. So before he died, he requested to look for all of you. He's Batman's butler. Mang Lando is mad at people who have fooled him before! He treated them as his friends, his co-workers! They copied his masterpieces! They mocked him! Ridiculed him! That's why he locked himself in this house for many years. Radical! What did he say? What is he? Is he really our cousin?! There are savings Mang Lando left. More than 20 million pesos which will be divided to all of you. Oh My! Thank you so much, Uncle! Thank you! When can we get it? In one month! What?! But why?! In one month, if someone dies among the four of you, the rest will divide the person's share. Bummer! Why does someone have to die? Maybe we can get an advance? That's not it. You still have other things to inherit. What? Follow me. - Okay! Okay! - Uncle, thank you so much! Is there a withholding tax for an inheritance? Fine! I'll lend you money! - Really, Myra?! Thank you so much! - Yes. - There's a 20 percent on top of that! - Yes! I have to pay for the ticket I bought! - Filemonl - Coming, mommy! Just a sec! Finally, I'll be seeing my daughter! - Come in. - Yes, mommy! - Just a minute. - The antiques here are really nice. Do I have buyers for antiques? Maybe this is the place where he writes. Uncle Donald! There's a horn! Hey you, pesky kid! Don't touch that! Don't hold anything! This isn't a horn. It's an old film. Look. You're right. Nice! It's a movie! Hey, Filemon. I was also a child star then. I've done a couple of movies. But you didn't become popular. Because it was Nifio Muhlach's time! But being an artist feels good! When the spotlight hits you, you become a different person. Child stars doesn't grow up, right? - But what happened to you? - Whatever! What really are we going to inherit? Hey! It's Konde Nado! The vampire who fell for Rosing. And the hairy monster, Filomena! Hairy? Yes! That's what she uses to kill because the townsmen shaved off her hair. She also turns into a boar. And this one, 'l'lyanak. He likes to kill the mothers. Because when he was born, he was thrown away by his mother. And this one, Rosalda. The ghost protagonist of the concert of death. She just plays the piano. But she can never stop. Because if she stops, someone will die. Those are Mang Lando's masterpieces. He left this inheritance to all of you. - What?! - Oh My! I thought it's jewelry or furniture! Those are cheap! Filemon's way more frightening than that! Look! Look! Am I right, Filemon? That's why the catholic school didn't take you in. If you will not take care of these masterpieces, you can't take the money! Oh! Mr. Good-looking is mine! The Tiyanak is mine. Rosalda's mine! The monster's yours. Wow. Wild. See you, guys! Can you open the trunk? - Myra! Myra! - Let's go! Hurry! Look at that woman! She just left us like that! I'll take this. Hey, Why is that here? Stop! Stop! Take it out! Take it out! - Th row it away! - Okay. It might even bring bad luck in to my house! Hurry! The meter's running! It's so hot! You're taking so long! The meter's running! Hurry! The meter's running! Driver, let's go! Here, take this fan. Oh my love! It's already August 20! Ten more days then you can come home here! YES! - You can leave your Arab master. - Cynthia. That's right! Hello? Partyline! Just be patient, partyline. I'm almost done. I'll go now. It's getting expensive. Bye! Take care! Hey, Cynthia! Cynthia! Emerson is here. - Emerson, come! Come. Come. - Yes, tita. Cynthia, smile! Hi, Emerson. We will soon see each other, my child. I have searched for you for a long time. You ruined the drama! I need to rebook everything. Of course, yes, this means a lot. Oh! Like if I'm going to survive this whole month,' and the others don't, I get to keep all the money! Radical! Hey, I gotta call you back. I smell something funny. Hey! Pig! How did you get here?! Jesus! Hey, both of you! When you fix your things, will you handle it carefully! The soap's box might get a dent. The canned goods! Customers might think it's fake! They won't give us the right payment. Hey you! I told you not to touch that! Get that! It fell! Give it to me! Mommy, no one's going to buy these! Who told you that?! All the things in here will be in sale. Even you! If someone's going to buy you, I'll definitely sell you! Come here! Come here! That's for Obelia, Nerissa, Rowena, Malou and Isabel! Put those inside the room! On the side! On the side! On the floor! So no one will crash it if someone enters. And I'll keep these toys so you won't touch it! These toys aren't yours! As if you're going to pay for it if anything gets broken! Do I sell coffins now? Look at me. - Come near. - Why?! You're my Rosing. Who is that? I'm not Rosing! You are my Rosing. I said I'm not Rosing! - Wait. You should be invited first! - You are mine. Not me! I'm local! - This one's imported! - Mommy! Let's go! Mommy! He's the - He's the vampire from the drawing, right?! You might've brought that creature here! Mommy, here! It's open! What happened?! Are you sure? Yes! The one with the cape and fangs! Exactly the one on the drawing! Konde Nado came to life?! - And you're even excited?! - But of course! That's Uncle's work. Oh My, Cynthia. That might be another suitor of yours again. That's embarrassing to Emerson. Okay. Good evening. We're from the NBI. Mommy, they said they're from the NBI. Ma'am, good evening. Are you Mrs. Feyagdepa? That's me. What is it? We just want to inform you that your cousin Benedict Collins was found dead. Dead? What happened? His bones are broken. And what's bothering is that there were lots of hair covering his body. - Filomena came to life! - What the?! Ma'am, just sign this confirmation that we found the closest kin of the victim. The victim's body is at the Quiogue funerary. Thank you, ma'am. We'll go now. Thank you. Our cousin's dead. His share is ours! - Hey, don't be like that! - What's the matter?! What I'm saying is true! But why does Uncle's works come to life? Are you sure those are his works? Don't you think his just getting his revenge? His butler said he died bitter. Why would he do that against us? No! We should make a plan! Mister! Mister! Is someone there?! - What nov No one's home. - Wait. Here. - Let's go here. - Come on, ma! Someone! - Someone there! - Someone! I think I'm giving up. I'll just wait here in the car. - Myra! - Let's go. Let's go. - Yes, mommy. - Yes, mommy! No! You go with them! - Help them! You can climb that one! - Benjie! Ask someone from there. You go first. L-lufTY- Mister! Is somebody home?! Mister! Good evening. - Looks like no one's home. - Good evening! It's so dark in here. Mister! Here's the switch. Nothing. Don't be afraid. We have a priest with us. - Filemonl What the?! - Yes! Come here! You go first! Here. Mister! - It's so dark. - Hurry! Hurry! Here. Nothing. The other one. Still nothing. - It's here. - Then open it. Mister! Somebody... Mister. No one's home. Hey. Did they already bury Uncle? As if he stood up and walked by himself! Will you please! My point is we were here yesterday, why didn't they say anything to us? - That's why the vampire attacked you! - Stop it! - Enough with this! - Stop, mommy! You know what, Let's just look for the helper so we can get out of here. - Maybe they have a ashlight we can use. - Here's the drawer. Come on! - This is just a carton. - That's him! That's him! That's him! That's him! He's Konde Nado! That's him! It's just a carton! Look! - Filemon, put it back. Hold it. - Okay. Look! There are lots of films! Donald! What if we convert those into betamax?! Come on. - Isn't there a ashlight?! - Or a match. Filemon, maybe there's a match near the candle. Come, we should have a light. Come, hurry! - Wait. Wait. - Here. Here. Auntie, I can't see anything! Just search for it. Are we set? Match. Auntie, I got it! We got the match. Good! You're taking so long! You're so skeptic! - There you go! - There. We have a light! It's mister! He followed Uncle. Uncle, bless him. House gets blessing. You mean extreme onction! Don't you think we have to report this to the police? Nothing. What? Oh My. Filemonl Come here! Yes, mom. Uncle Donald, let me help you. - Wait. Wait! This is just hard to open. - Wh at? - Now what? Maybe - - I can't open it. - Uncle Benjie! - It won't open. - How are we suppose to go out? - Oh no. - What nov! It's closed. Oh no. What are we going to do nov - Here! Here! - Hurry, Uncle! It won't open! - You! Go ahead! - I'll try here! - Go! Go! - It still won't open. Go. Help them open it. - What are we going to do?! - Here! Here! Hey. The windows are barred. Did they intend to lock us up here? Uncle! Your works are actually great! I was even thinking of having a retrospective of your works to EC P. Just let us get out of here, please. Please! Don't you know any protection, Donald? Those you learned from the seminary. Nothing. - Why did you get out of the seminary? - You know what? I've been wanting to ask you this, Donald. You were our priest when Joaquin and I got married? Does it mean our wedding is void? We really have to chat here?! Today! Here! You should think of how are we suppose to get out of here! What do your Uncle really want?! Why is he doing this to us?! If they're giving us the money, then give it! They don't need to scare us! You only think of money! Hey! After 16 years, you finally get to say something decent! Maybe because he's mad at the world, that's why he wants to take out his relatives. And you too! Hey, you. - Hey, Filemonl - Yes! What the?! Mommy, I'm getting hungry Go to the kitchen. See if you'll find something to eat. I'm scared! Then take someone with you! There! Filemonl - Filemonl - Yes! What's happening to you?! It's so difficult to ask for your favor! I'm not! M)/rag Now, you're talking back! You're reasoning! Come here! You're so hard-headed and yet you're so ugly! I'm getting hyper because of you! Where is that from? But no one's here. Please! That's just wind! That's a very strong wind! Mommy, I don't want to go. - I don't want to go to the kitchen anymore. - What the?! Atop really do spin! And you! I told you to go with your sister! Let's go! Myra! What's with you?! Why are you treating Filemon like that?! Hey, Donald! Mind your own child! You should pray that you'd finally meet her! Why are you treating your child like that?! He's my husband's son from his chicks! Hey. Myra - And you! You don't even have feelings towards that child! You should be thankful that I took him in when his mother left him! See?! It's the fruit of a sin so he looks like a sin! You know what I do to him?! I lock him up in a cabinet so he'll learn but he never learn! I need to go to the C.R. I'll go with you, tita. I'll go instead! I suddenly need to pee. Don't go anywhere! Filemon? I thought you're with your sister. I already did. Filemon. You know what? Your mommy's just stressed out of her business. But she loves you. That's not true! Oh My! Myra! You're an evil mother! You're an evil wife! You know what?! Your mother is a lovechild of another uncle of ours. You're the rich one and yet you're the evil one! When she and her mother went to the burial, my mother got mad. They were thrown out. Since then, she's always mad at me. Come on. Let's just go there! Don't mind my aunt. We, the poor, are the ones kind. Hey, Gladys! Come with me. I want that too. I'm getting hungry! Such a plastic! Why do you have to be my relative?! Am I right? It's all yours!

You know, your mom... abuses your brother too much! You're right. Good thing, she treats you differently Since she gave birth to you when she wasn't married yet. What?! Oh no! Rosalda! You don't know? Oh My. I'm sorry. What's the matter with that? You know us, lovechilds, we're tougher than they are. We are survivors! Rosalda! It's really you! I watch you when I was young. I even dream about you. Your dad had your boyfriend killed because he's just a farmer! You know magic? And you can't stop playing the piano! Because if you stop, your boyfriend will die. Nice! It turned into a ball! Rosalda. Help us. Don't let us die in here. But me, I'm not allowed to play. What kind of powers do you have? In the room, where we were created. What? Among the old things.

And he's the most evil one too. How did you know that?! He wrote it here on his notes. Myra. Myra. Myra. M)/rag Myra... Filemonl File-- File-- Who are you?! He's the last monster he created! He didn't give it to others because he doesn't trust them anymore. He's Buboy. The little devil. Don't play around here. There are lots of monsters and creatures here! Come! Play is the only thing he wants to do. So whenever he kills somebody, he plays around the victim first. Hey! Will you stop that! I'm getting scared! And according to this, Buboy's the only one who can control and stop other monsters. He's heartless. His chest is empty so the only thing he eats is human heart. Emerson! Emerson. This is the little devil's fault. What?! - What?! - We discovered something! YES! The monsters are gone! Filomena's gone too? They're all gone?! What are you talking about?! Look at Emerson! He was bitten by a vampire! He's covered with hair! He's stabbed! He's dead! Wait! Wait! Wait! What devil are you saying?! Here! He controls all the monsters! What are we going to do?! Where's Benjie?! I thought he's with you! - Where's Filemon?! - He's with you! Filemonl Maybe he's in the closet! He loves being there anyway! Wait. I'll look for him. No need!

All you do is talk! Get me the radio. They're brutal. Over the base! Sir! Sir! Someone's still alive! He's still breathing! Captain Baltog! They're from hell! They eat flesh! You soldiers! What do you think, sir? Whatever this is we should pursue them. Where are we going to find them? I'm sure they already hid themselves in town. Right there. Sir, aren't we going back? What are we really looking for?! I don't know. Whatever this is, we should be ready. Secure the area, men! Go! What the heck are we doing here? This is too far from our camp. Aren't we going back yet? They said those are monsters. Even monster wear uniforms nov Maybe that's why they cutoff the budget for our uniforms! The monsters steal it! Let's go. What really is our mission? Why don't they tell us? Just ask lieutenant. Let's go. There are no reinforcement report and rebel function group here. People say they are vigilantes. Others say they are CAFGU. And some say they are monsters. They say there are six, seven, eight. And others say there are ten. But all of them points to one leader, Captain Baltog. Lost command. They are heavily armed. The ones we encountered are from the North. So probably they're heading towards that mountain. What? Still a stubborn? Upaon. - Sir. - Have you contacted them? Negative, sir. No one's answering on the other side of line. All these info I relay to you is on a need to know basis. So don't do anything without my knowing. Understand? - Yes, sir! - Yes, sir! We're heading to the next town. At Pototan town. God dammit, soldiers! Pocket your laughter, soldiers! Is this your first time to hear Pototan? Lock and load. The enemies have heavy artillery. - Let's take it one is to two. - Is that it? I'll take three. I won't take chances. Dude, you can't. You can only get two. Cobra. Cobra. This is Lion. Come in.Over.

Good evening. We just need to inform you something. Bo)'- What are you doing there? Come here. Come down here. Don't be afraid. You're taking over our little friend's home. You can put down your hands. We're not your enemy. Why do you look scared? Were there rebels or soldiers who passed by here? What's your name, boy? Bunag, sir. Bunag. Did you recognize them? They're soldiers. But not anymore. They're monsters. How many? Four? Five? What's their purpose? Recruit, sir. Recruit? They took my father. What do you mean? NPA? MILF? Or Abu Sayyaf? - Serve the country! - Sir! Sir, we're both from here, sir! Serve the country! Be a soldier! Okay, sir. Yes . Yes . Repeat after me! I am a servant of the country. I am a servant of the country! Ready to fight! Bunag! Bunag, run! Bunag! You're thinking of your father? HE'S gone! He's now one of them. Where do you think they are? At their camp. - On the other side of the river. - Have pity on us. Leave my grandchild alone! - Have pity on us! - Do you think they're coming back? Come! Come, my grandchild! We're staying in for the night. - Yes, sir. - Tornedo. Pugeda. Secure the entrance. - Yes, sir. - Move. Dude. What's wrong with your radio? It's always acting up! I don't know if it's the radio or because we're too deep in the forest. Help, boys. Dude. You might get caught. That's you call. You still have a request. I could file an action form on March. Where are you from anyway? From Alaminos. I just text my wife. That's okay! I also need to make a request. I just don't know when to file it. Philippines Army Always outnumbered, never outgunned! Where is that from?! Follow me! Follow me! Move! Move! Move! Move! Dude! Dude, it's Pugeda! What happened?! - They took Pugeda! - Dude, there's blood! - They bit me! - Take care of Ornedo! - Take back Pugeda! - Barrientos, go to the other side! Devera, take the lead! Move! Move! Move! Move! Move! Faster! Men! Sharpen your eyesights! This is Pugeda's. Go! Move! Devera! What's that?! Fire! Fire! Fire! What is that?! Dude, I don't know! Upaon! Upaon! Where's Lieutenant?! Where's Lieutenant?! Sir. He was taken! Taken?! Who took him?! What do you mean?! He just lifted Pugeda as if he's a child. He lifted him without any trace of weight. I didn't shoot at them. I might hit Pugeda. Then suddenly something bit my shoulders. But I was able to hit him with my gun. He suddenly disappeared but he's not alone. There are lots of them up in the trees. Like monkeys. Sarge. What about us? We have to take them back. Sarge, maybe we need to report this to our base. What if we go back first? No. We're here now. We won't abandon them. Try to contact the base! Lion to base. Lion to base. Please respond, over. Sarge. He's been out of signal. Even the cellphones. We have to take back lieutenant and the others. But where, Sarge?! Where are we going to find them?! We've been going circles! We don't know the terrain! The reason the base can't contact us is because they don't know where we are! Damn it, Upaon! You're messing up everything! Do as you are ordered! I know where they took my father! I'm sure your lieutenant's also there. I'll bring you there! Give me a gun. Alright, we'll give you a gun. Sarge! We can't do that. I didn't say I'm going to put a bullet in it. Go ahead. Dude, that looks like smoke. Bo)'- What's that? Who's that? A girl. Hey kid. Why are you alone here? What's your name? Is it your group? Our group? The replacements. Replacements for? For those who died. Where are your parents? Are they here? They were many of them. My father's at the camp. Camp? Come. I can smell something fishy. Sarge! Something's not right. I have this feeling. And why would she force us to come Wherever Lieutenant Garces and Pugeda are, that's where we'll go. Radio base, aren't they answering yet? Cobra. This is Lion. Come in, over. Cobra. This is special force Lion. Come in, over. Sarge, there's nothing. Sarge, I think we need to go back to base. Maybe we need to ask for reinforcement. Sarge. - I think Upaon's right. - We might get late. Where are we really heading? Wherever you're going. There's nowhere to go from here. Some of our men were taken. Now, we have to take them back. My father can help you. He's been fighting the monsters. Let's go. Men! Move! Something's changed. Someone changed the path. Maybe it was just flown by the river. You can't see? You're blind? MY eyes, yes. But I can see a lot more. Like you. I know you're a good person. And you're all good people. Let's go. Where are we nov We've passed the forbidden river. We're near my father's meeting place. Have you been here? We're not allowed to go here. We're here. Father! Father, I'm here! Father, we're here now! Father! Father! Father! My child. Father! - Father. - I brought a lot today for you, my child. Really? You will like it all. Father. Are they the ones who'll replace? You will finally be complete to fight against the monsters. Okay, my child. Go home. 'Til next time, my child. Thank you. Where are Lieutenant Garces and other men of ours?! You passed by the river.
