We're nominated for best comedy web show! I know. I speak British. The iWeb Awards would like to fly the iCarly team overseas, so that your show can compete at this year's live competition, All expenses paid, of course, -This is insane! -They're gonna fly us overseas! -I just hope it's not France. -How come? -Why? -'Cause it's full of French people. -Oh, yeah. -True. If you accept your nomination, please click on the "Accept" button in the lower left corner of this v-mail, -Click on it! -I'm clicking. Your invitations, passes, and travel itinerary will be sent off to you tomorrow, Congratulations, iCarly. We'll see you at the iWeb Awards, All right. Okay, this is the biggest thing that's ever happened to us. -Ever. -By far. Check it out. Way more people are voting for legs than pudding. Told you. All I know is you can't do this with legs. -Uh, you have a little pudding on your... -I see it. You sure you don't mind if I hang at your place till dinner? Yeah, it's fine, but don't you think you should go home and be with your mom? -What for? -'Cause she's in bed with pneumonia. I'm not a doctor. -Excuse me, Lewbert? -What? I'm busy trimming my wart hairs! Yeah. I was just wondering if I got a package yet from the iWeb Awards. No! Now quit upsetting my wart! Are you sure? 'Cause this guy in England said he was gonna send it like a week ago. To you, too! Hey. Hey. You think Freddie's home from school yet? Yeah, he got a ride. Why? Bet you he's looking through his peephole, waiting for you to get home. No, he grew out of that. Uh-huh. 'Sup? I was not looking out my peephole waiting for you to come home. -I know you weren't. -Good. -Peeper. -What? -Okay, why is it dark in here? Because... I made this! Why? It's for jogging at night. This baby puts out over 19,000 lumens. It can light up a football field. -For how long? -Until this battery runs out. I got it out of a Prius. Oh, hi, Mrs Benson. Mom, what are you still doing here? I thought you left for your pottery class. I tried to, but my Prius wouldn't start. Anyway, I forgot. This package addressed to iCarly came yesterday... -Yesterday? -I'm sorry, I meant to tell Freddie... Oh, just give it. -Is that from the iWeb Awards? -Yeah! Come on, what country are we going to? Canada. Canada? Just kidding! Tokyo! We're going to Japan! All right. -Freddie, you can let go now. -Oh, right. Sweet! You know, I took a year of Japanese in college. A little brush up, I'll be speaking Japanese like a Japanesiologist. Freddie, I'm not sure I can Allow this. -Here we go. -Mom. It's just Japan. Right, which is why I worry that... You know the Far East can be very... Look, just because I can't think of anything right now, doesn't mean Japan isn't fraught with danger. -Come on, lady. -It's okay. I'm going with them, so it's not like they won't have a responsible adult making sure everything goes smooth. Put it out! Put it out! Put it out! Please, please, please, put it out! Put it out! So, I'll make sure everything goes smooth in Japan. Freddie, you're not going to Japan. You're coming home with me to take a bath. -But... Wait! Why don't you come to Japan with us? -What? -I don't wanna take a trip across the world with that mess of a woman! Come on, Mrs Benson. It'll be fun. What's that? I think I hear Tokyo calling Toki-you. Come with us to Japan. You love sushi. I suppose it would be nice to try a California roll from where it All started. Wait, hang on. Little problem. -What? -Three plane tickets. Good. I mean, "Oh, no." Here, let me see. Okay, great, these are first class tickets. I can just trade these for five coach seats and we're All set. All right. But if we're All going to Japan, there's lots of preparation to be done. We'll need passports, fresh underwear, a voltage converter for your night light. I don't need a night light any more. So you're sure the night light will work in Japan? We'll make sure. Man, she's a piece of work. Put it out, put it out! Get it! Get it! Why does this keep happening? L know, Oomp, if l had a haircut like yours, l would be embarrassed, too, So this is Henri P'Twa and his poodle puppet, Oomp. Okay, fine, eat your puppy food! That's the "comedy show" we're competing against? One of them. That poodle puppet eats like a pig. My goodness, Oomp! L think you eat like a little piggy! No, Bad dog! No, Oomp, bad dog! -Uh-oh. -Maybe Oomp should be neutered. This is my show! Hello, -Excellent, -Thank you. How are you today? -Wait, what? -I'm sorry, The pain helps you learn, But I didn't say it wrong! I was asking you to repeat it! -Who are you yelling at? -Him, the Japanese Learning Wizard. He teaches me Japanese phrases, and if I don't say them right, he shocks me with this collar. I hate it! -So take the collar off. -I can't! It's magnetically locked until you get past Level One. How are you today? - ...what? -No, no, no. The pain helps you learn, The pain is melting my throat! So, what's with her? Oh, she teaches you how to speak Swedish. I bought her when I bought him. -Why, 'cause she's hot? -Well, not just 'cause... Yes. Okay, so what's this other show we're competing against? It's a Japanese web show called Kyoko and Yuki, They're Japanese? Great, then they'll have a home court advantage. Just put their web show on. No one's paying you to look pretty. No one's paying me at All. -Just click the thingy. -Okay. Kyoko and Yuki, Just teach me how to play this guitar! You are the worst student l have ever taught! Why do you play the guitar so badly? L don't know! -Well, just try! -Okay! -Play better! -I'm trying! Okay, they're kind of funny. -Definitely. -Well, yeah, but you guys are funnier. Thanks. We just have to come up with something totally hilarious to do at the competition. Okay. How about you and I play two kids at a birthday party, trying to break open a piata? And let me guess, Freddie plays the piata? Yes. Why does every idea you have involve hitting me with a stick? Come on. Let's watch them a little more so we know exactly what we're up against. Well, I'm not worried. Kyoko and Yuki aren't that funny. Oh, no! A bee! -I've seen funnier. -We'll beat those guys easy. All right, they're hilarious. Okay, okay, turn it off! All right, let's face it, Kyoko and Yuki are really funny. -But... -They're really funny! So is iCarly, -We're gonna win that iWeb Award. -Right. And even if we don't win, I mean, it's still an honor just to be nominated, right? Yeah, and win or lose, we still get a free trip to Japan. Whoa, whoa. I don't wanna hear this "or lose" talk, All right? -But I just meant that... -Saying "or lose" is like giving up. Carly, when Miss Briggs told us we couldn't pick the kids to be in the talent show, -did you give up? -No. And what about the time those cops were chasing me and yelling at me to stop running. -Did I give up? -No, you kept running. And, Freddie, have you ever given up your hope that one day Carly might love you? -No. -Well, you should. Anyway, we are gonna beat Kyoko and Yuki and win that iWeb Award. You're right. We just got to come up with the funniest iCarly bit we've ever done. -Yeah! -Absolutely! -Good. Let's get to work. -Right. You guys start. I'm gonna go take a nap. Hello, how are you? You are one fine mama jama. I'm sorry, Yes. Hey, Socko, you talk to your buddy the pilot? No way, yeah? He can fly All of us to Japan? Socko, who's better than you? Okay, Ryan Seacrest is awesome, but so are you! Yeah, text me later. So, you wanna come to Japan with me? I'm sorry, And now, The Adventures of Melanie Higgles. I'm Melanie Higgles! Space cheerleader, Oh, yeah! Uh-huh. Oh, yeah, oh, yeah. Uh-huh. Melanie Higgles. Oh, yeah! Uh-huh. What's up? What's up? What's up? Come to the dark side of space cheerleading. No way! Get outer my space! Oh, yeah! -Come to the dark side. -No! Grow! -Get out! -Join me! -No way! -You know you want to. -You're super annoying! -Come to the dark side! -Give me an "ow"! -Ow! -Give me an "ow"! -Ow! -Give me an "ow"! -Ow! -Give me an "ow"! -Ow! And we're clear! -So what'd you think? -Hilarious. It's awesome. -See? -We've got our bit -for the iWeb Awards. -Yeah, we do. -So what's next? -Well, if you guys are interested, I went online and found All kinds of interesting facts about Japan. Well, tell us. Like when was Japan formed? What's their economy like? How does their culture differ from ours? What are their major exports? -Are they a democracy? -How strong is their Navy? What are the popular foods? Does Japan have universal heath care? They don't wanna know. Sam, maybe you wanna come help us? No, thanks. I wanna get my heel really smooth. Yeah, well, thanks for getting your nasty foot dust All over our couch. My mom is a nut case. You're just now figuring that out? -Just a few more, Freddie. -No. You need to be vaccinated. But you've already given me 11 shots! Yes, you're halfway done. Come here. -No! -Freddie! Come on, now. I have a spatula. Hey, we got to be at the airport in 45 minutes. I better finish packing. -What are those, snacks? -Uh-huh. Fat Cakes? These are low fat Fat Cakes. For who? The heath conscious Fat Cake eater? -Just help me pack. -Okay. Just one last shot, Freddie. Come across the hall and I'll give it to you at home. No, let's just do it here and get it over with. Um, this one doesn't go in your arm. Well, then, where does it... Oh, man. We'll meet you down in the lobby -in five minutes. -Hurry! No, no, Mom, I don't want a shot. It's gonna hurt so bad, I'm gonna pass out. -Okay, we ready? -Let's see. Pack suitcases. Done. Turn off heat. Done. Keys in pocket. Done. Crumple list and toss casually in trash can. Close enough. -Do you have the plane tickets? -We don't need tickets. Socko says we're gonna be the only people on the plane. -You got us a private jet? -No. -Better? -No. Come on. This way. Keep coming. Oh, watch where you step. So, your name is Freight Dog? Yeah. And this is my pepperoni. Well, thanks for letting me smell it. This is your aeroplane? Yep. Wow. This is almost as nice as a gas station men's room. Thanks. What are All the possums for? That's my cargo on this trip. Anything anybody wants transported overseas, I fly it. Are the possums safe? No, ma'am, they're full of disease. Okay! Let's fly! Wait. Where's the restroom on this plane? Oh. Here you go. If you guys fill that one up, I got more buckets in the back. Excuse me. I am not going to do my business in this bucket. -I am a lady. -Oh, right. Sorry. Here. -That poor bucket. -Yeah, you have no idea. -This is insane. -I know. I can't believe I'm flying to Japan on a cargo plane surrounded by possi. -Possi? -What is possi? It's the plural of possum. No, it's not. One possum. Many possi. That's so stupid. It is not. I'm having anxiety. Okay. -Are you cold? -Little bit. Maybe we should snuggle close together, -you know, to keep warm and... -No. All right. Hey. Look at me with a possum. Sam, don't eat him! I'm not gonna... I'm not gonna eat him. Sam, be careful with that thing. You don't know where it's been. Like we know where Sam's been. How's everybody doing? Shouldn't you be flying the plane? What do you think this rope's for? See? -We get it! -Freight Dog! Hey, why are you taking All these possums to Japan, anyway? Oh, they're not going to Japan. They're going to Korea. Possi are the most popular pets there now. But wait. Socko said you're taking us to Japan. No, I'm taking you over Japan. -Over! What? Here, hold my pepperoni! -Oh, may I? -Yeah! Welcome to Japan! We should be over Tokyo in about five minutes. That's when you jump! I recommend using a parachute. Who wants one? Goggles! Get your goggles here! Can't go up without your goggles. Here we go, ma'am. Take one for yourself! Here you go, son! Okay. Thank you! We're parachuting into Japan? Can someone hand me the pink bucket? If you guys wanna land in Tokyo, you better jump in the next two minutes! I am not putting on this parachute. I would rather go to Korea with the diseased possi. How could your friend Socko not have mentioned that we'd have to jump out of the plane into Japan? He might have mentioned it. He said Freight Dog could drop us in Japan. I didn't realize he actually meant drop us. We got to get to the iWeb Awards, so let's just jump. Guys, there's no way my mom is jumping out of this aeroplane. I know how to make her jump. No chance. She's been afraid of heights ever since... O-M-G! I'm coming, Freddie! Pechanga! Okay. Who's next? Ladies first. All right. Oh! Hold my hand? Ready? Shouldn't we count to three first? Nope! Just scream! -When? -Now! Good job! Brother! You got to jump now! Right. Sorry. My friend here is just a little nervous. Hello, No! I didn't mean to turn you on! I'm sorry, Good job! -That was insane! -I know! -We're in Japan! -I know! Where's a sushi bar? I can't get out of this psychotic parachute! Stupid thing. I can't believe we were forced to jump into Japan. When I see Spencer, I am going to tell him in no uncertain terms -that I... Here I come! Mom! Come on. Are you All right? What happened? -Are you All right? -Are you okay? Yeah! Whoa! Whoa! That was intense! Hey, your collar broke. Oh, yeah! At least now I don't have to worry about... I think Freight Dog threw our luggage out of the plane. What makes you think that... The Fat Cakes are okay. Hey, did anybody see my red backpack come down? Okay, I think that's everything. What happened? -Finally. -The front desk is right over there. -Thank you so much. -Thank you so much, Officer. I don't know what we would've done if you hadn't found us. Oh. You would have slowly starved in the wilderness until you All perished and were eaten by wild animals. -Right. -Well, thanks so much. -He was nice. -He was weird. I took his handcuffs. -I'll go check us in. -Haven't you done enough? -I'll do it. -I'll go with you. -Hi. -Hello. Welcome to Hotel Nakamura. -May I help you? -Yeah, we're checking in. Oh, honeymoon couple? No. My name's Carly Shay. We have reservations through the iWeb Awards. Yes, let me check and see what room you are in. This is a catastrophe! You must speak with me now. Excuse me, but we were here first. I was supposed to have a separate room for my poopit. -Your poopit? -What's a poopit? -Poopit! -Puppet? Okay. Look, I've had a really tough day which included jumping out of a cargo plane full of possums and wandering in the Japanese wilderness for seven hours, so I'd... I cannot share a room with this poopit! -Sir... -I got this. Oomp! Can I please check in? Yes, the iWeb Awards have provided you with a double suite. -I hope you find the rooms to your liking. -Thanks. -Thank you. -Cool. -Okay, we're All set. -Awesome. Finally. -Ah! Enjoy your honeymoon. -Stop saying that! Oh, nice. -Cool room. Check it out. This is so exciting. My first pee in a foreign country. Have fun. -I've got to crash. -Me, too. So, how are we going to split up? Maybe the boys in this room and us girls in the other one? No! Wouldn't you rather share a room with your sweet son, Freddie? Freddie needs you. -Guys... -No, Freddie, they're right. Thanks a lot. -Hey, where'd Spencer go? In here! Look, they leave you these cute little candies in the bathroom. I am loving this hotel. You know they have 24 hour room... It's soap. Carly. Someone's knocking at the door. Someone's knocking. I'll get it. Wake up! -Who is it? Kyoko and Yuki. -Kyoko and Yuki? -Our competition? Who are Kyoko and Yuki? The kids who star in one of the web shows we're competing against. What are they doing here? -Hi. -Hello. I am Yuki. Kyoko. Welcome to Japan. Yes! Thanks. Come on in. -Hi. Hi. Hey. I'm Carly, and that's Sam and Freddie. - Oh, of course. - We know. -We love your web show. -Hey, we love yours. -Yeah. -It's awesome. Oh. And this is my brother, Spencer. I ate soap. We just woke up. At 3:00 in the afternoon? We slept through breakfast and lunch? Fat Cake. What are you guys doing here? Well, we found out that you were staying at this hotel... And we wanted to welcome you to Tokyo. Please accept this expensive gift basket. -Cool. -Thanks. So, your trip here was good? Yeah, the plane ride was pretty insane. Till we had to jump out. You jumped out of your aeroplane? Some jumped. Some were pushed. We know it sounds weird, 'cause, well, it was weird, -but we're fine. -We are. Some of our luggage fell to its death. -Drowned in a lake. -I thought the soap was candy. Well, if some of your luggage drowned, as you say... Would you like us to take you shopping? -Shopping? -Do we have time? Oh, yes. The iWeb Awards do not start for five hours. Plenty of time. Freddie? Freddie, look at these wonderful robes the hotel gives you. Oh, hello. Could we get a few extra towels and some unscented toilet paper? They don't work here, crazy. They have a web show that got nominated for an iWeb Award. It's a pleasure to meet you. Oh. They want to take us shopping. Ooh! I'd like to go shopping. Oh, well, we would love for you to join us. But for the grownups, Yuki and I have arranged traditional Japanese seaweed massages. -Massages? -I could use a good rubbing. Here. Our cousins work at the spa just down the street. You will have a wonderful massage there. -Awesome. Well, thank you. So, shall we go shopping? Sure, just give us a little time to shower and get dressed? -Of course. -Freddie, make sure you put on a fresh pair of anti-bacterial underpants. Mom. So, are you nervous about the competition tonight? Sure, a little bit. What, don't you feel All confident wearing your anti-bacterial underpants? At least my underwear doesn't have "I heart Las Vegas" written across the butt. You looked in my suitcase? I did not look in your suitcase! Hey! There's nothing wrong with wearing underwear that fights bacteria. -Yeah. -Or that was purchased in a casino. Yeah. You guys are hilarious. Just like on iCarly, well, your guys' show is really funny, too. -Thanks. -Thank you. Aw! Who brought his little junior camcorder? It happens to shoot in high-def. He told you. Yuki, weren't we supposed to turn left back there? I know where I'm going. But I think we passed the turn. I'm driving, okay? Don't be obnoxious. And this is real seaweed? Wow, I feel like a gigantic spicy tuna roll. So, you're both cousins of Kyoko and Yuki. -Yes. -Well, my Freddie is very excited to be competing against them in the iWeb Awards. -So is my sister. You ever seen iCarly? -No. Well. -There. You are wrapped. -Cool. -So now what? -Now, we go to see a movie. -A movie? -And then maybe go for some Italian food. Perhaps some Eggplant Parmesan. -Wait, we don't understand. -You will soon. But when are you gonna unwrap us? When the iWeb Awards are over. After Kyoko and Yuki have won. -What? -You guys are kidding, right? Are you kidding? I don't think they're kidding. -We've been set up! -Yeah. I don't think those Kyoko and Yuki kids are as nice as they seemed. The children! We have to warn them! Relax. This is just seaweed, how strong can it be? Fight! Fight, Spencer! Spencer? Seaweed can be very strong. Why don't you just admit that you are lost? -Hey, guys... -I am not lost! Why must you disrespect everything I stand for? -Hey! -Kyoko. -Yuki! -You guys! Look, we don't even have time to shop any more. The iWeb Awards start in two hours. So let's just head back to our hotel, so we don't miss it, okay? Yeah, we don't want that French moron with the poopit to win by default. -They are right. -Yes. We should get you back to your hotel, so we can All make it to the iWeb Awards on time. -Thanks. -Thank you. We are heading back to the hotel, right? 'Cause it looks like we're in the middle of nowhere. Okay, we're lost. I knew it. I am sorry we spoiled your welcome to our country. Oh, come on, you didn't spoil our welcome. Why did we stop? -We're out of gas. -And now the welcome is spoiled. You didn't get gas? Yes, I got gas! Then we drove very far in the wrong direction, and now gas is gone! And the iWeb Awards start in an hour and a half. Well, ain't this sweet. The five of us are gonna miss the awards, so Frenchie and his poopit are gonna win best comedy show on the web. Can't you guys just call your parents or someone to come pick us up? We don't have cell phones with us. Okay, then, I'll just call Spencer so... Your American cell phones don't work in Japan. You have ruined everything. I told you when to turn, but you refused! What about the time you left my bicycle out in the rain? That was nine years ago! I'm still upset! This is bad. What are we gonna do? I'm so hungry. This is impossible! I can't believe we're trapped by seaweed! -Seaweed. -Yes! -Seaweed is edible. -So? If I can't break my way out, maybe I can eat my way out. It's working! Try it! I can't! We Bensons have short necks. Well, don't worry, I'm gonna have us out of here fast! This is serious! Why are you laughing? Something about Japanese arguing cracks me up. They're leaving the van. Why are they leaving the van? They're fighting! -Spencer? -'Sup? -What are you doing? -I'm eating! -Eat faster! -I'm eating as fast as I can! I'm out! I'm free! You're naked. What happened to our clothes? Oh, those rotten masseuses took them. Towels. Don't look! Don't worry. Okay. I'm good. All right. Now chew me out of here. I can't. I'm full. Well, use that sword on the wall to cut me out. -Spencer! -What? Your towel fell off. Oh, my God! Hey, hey, hey, give me your camcorder. Why are you recording this? To put on iCarly.com. Kids love violence. Uh-oh. Yuki's got her now. You almost kicked me in the head! We have to make this look like a real fight. No problem. Come on, Yuki! Get up and show her what your foot tastes like! Freddie, you're a boy. Get in there and break it up. Come on. -No, I don't wanna. I don't wanna. -Come on, break it up. -I'm not gonna. I don't wanna. -Break it up. -Go. Go. -Okay. Fine, I will. Guys! Guys, seriously! Just break it up, this isn't... Freddie! Okay, that is definitely going on iCarly.com. -Okay, my towel is on. -Nice. Let's go. What's the matter? Those massage jerks locked us in here. What? No way. It's bolted from the outside. We've got to get out of here. There's an air vent! So? I'm gonna climb in there, crawl through the duct to another room, get us out of here. Okay. Be careful. Wow, it's so dark in here. You see anything? No, it's so dark in here. Wait, I see a light! Oh, good, it probably leads to another room. Yeah, I'm heading toward it right now. What's wrong? Just threw up a little seaweed. Well, are you getting any closer to the vent? Yep. Just a few more feet. Getting closer to the light. There, I can touch it! -Good! Can you get out? -I think so. Yeah! Hey. -Spencer. -I didn't know. -Be careful. -I got it. Help! Can't anybody hear us? Shut up! -Let's go! -Come on. My eye look okay? Yes. -For real? -No. It's All black and... Ew! It's throbbing. All right, this fight's getting old. That's how we do it in Seattle. -No problem. We had a little incident. -Pardon us. -No need to stare. Arigato, -Don't blame America. Oh, my God. The pain did not help me learn! Ha! I'm wearing a second towel. Thank you. Thank you. I can't believe Kyoko and Yuki tricked us like that. It's Freddie's backpack. And it smells just like his face. You know, that seaweed must be awesome for your skin. Look at me, I'm glowing. The children have been kidnapped by evil Japanese web comedians! What are we gonna do? Seriously, I'm glowing, right? I'm really sorry Sam had to get physical with you guys. I'm sorry your foot had to get physical with my eye. I'm sorry I haven't eaten anything in four hours. -Sam... -Well, listen to my stomach. I don't want to listen to... Oh, my God, it sounds like Chewbacca. Doesn't it? It is we who owe you an apology... For ruining your trip to Japan. And any chance for either of our web shows to win at the iWeb Awards. To apologise, please Allow us to present you with a special gift. -Why a gift? -It's a Japanese tradition to give someone a gift after you cause them trouble. Oh, that's so nice. Where is it? It is in our van. Yes. We will both go get your gift... While the three of you stand there. You guys don't have to give us anything. Don't disrespect their traditions. Is it expensive? It is very special. -Just stay right there... -...And we'll be right back. Hey, I thought the van ran out of gas. I don't think we're getting a gift. Maybe they're driving somewhere to get it. No, they did All this on purpose so they could ditch us and then go win the iWeb Award! So they're definitely not giving us a present. No! I feel like we've been walking for nine years. I can't believe I got a black eye. Ahhh! It's still throbbing. Yeah, yeah, so is my head from All your yapping. How long till the iWeb Awards start? Less than half an hour. There's no way we're gonna make it. Not possible, zero chance. Hey, that's the spirit. I'm just being realistic. Look, I'm sure Spencer and Freddie's mom are doing everything they can to find us. And anyway, aren't you the one who gave us the "only losers give up" speech? I don't know. I don't listen to the things I say. Well, you did, and you were right, so let's not give up now. Well, what are we supposed to do? I don't know. But it's not helping for you guys to keep talking about how hungry and miserable you are. We All know that your eye is black and throbbing, and we All know you're starving, so let's forget that stuff and try to think positively, All right? Maybe Spencer and Freddie's mom will find us in time, and maybe they'll bring eye ointment and cheeseburgers. I just think if we try to keep a positive attitude, then maybe we'll... I'm depressed. Excuse me, we have an emergency. Excusez-moi, I am in the middle... -I don't have time to talk to you. -You don't have time to talk to me? We don't know where they are... Why am I arguing with a poodle with a mustache? Here. He's yours if you run away. Oomp! Oomp, come back! Oomp! Come back. Listen, my little sister and her two friends were kidnapped by evil Japanese web comedians, and we don't know where they are, -so if you could please call the... -Oh, my God! -What? -The chip! In All this confusion, I completely forgot about the chip. -Chip? -What chip? As soon as Freddie was old enough to toddle, I had a locater chip put in his head by a questionable doctor in Venezuela. You chipped Freddie? Oh! I chipped him because I love him. You mean a locater chip, like a GPS kind of thing? Yes! But you can never tell him. I won't. I won't. How do we find him? With this.

Well, you should have gripped it more firmly. I'm just a person! Well, now, how are we gonna find the children? I don't know. Maybe we should pull over and ask those muddy hobos if they've seen them.

Welcome t the International iWeb Awards, coming to you live from Tokyo, Japan! -The International Web Commission, ,, -Here we go. ...invites you to watch and vote online for your favourite web stars, Now, please welcome your host, Victor Price! Thank you. Thanks so much. Thank you. Okay, settle down. Settle down now. Settle! You know, there are so many reasons why I'm standing here on this stage, coming to you live from Tokyo, Japan, hosting the iWeb Awards. The main reason? well, the Oscars, they didn't want me, so... No, no, I'm kidding. This is actually a huge honor for me. - Hi! Hey! - Excuse us! -We're iCarly, -From America. As in the United States of. We're supposed to be competing in the iWeb Awards competition. It's not our fault we're late. -You can blame Kyoko and Yuki. -They kidnapped us. Then ditched us in the middle of nowhere. -With no snacks. -Or a proper restroom. I wasn't speaking Spanish. Come on, let's just go in. -We are performers! -We're nominees! One of the teams we're competing against tried to cheat by getting rid of us! -What? -It's nobody's birthday! You're so random! -Ready one. Go one! One up. We have a little something special for you. Are you ready? Okay, okay. All the way from America, here they are, Good Charlotte! Don't you have tickets or passes or something? Yeah, they were in our suitcase that Freight Dog dropped into the lake. Here, let me talk to the guy. Okay. Maybe I didn't say that quite right. Did you understand any of that? I'm not sure, but I think he called us dirty street monsters. Look! We're missing the show. We need to go inside! Okay! When I say "now, " everybody scream and run inside. -He can't stop All of us. -I don't think that's a good... Now! All right! Just forget it. That is fake hair! What'd I say? Next up are the nominees for best cooking show, I can't believe they won't let us in! We came this close and now we finally got here and we're still gonna lose by default. -So now what? -I don't know. Why don't we All go back to the hotel and pack up? No! Do you not get that iCarly is really important to me? And to them? This was a big deal for us. Whatever, let's just get out of here. No. I'm going back over to those security guards. But they don't speak English. I'm going to distract them. When I do, you All run inside that door. -Now! Come on! Let's go! -We're coming. Go, go, go, go, go! Pechanga! Okay, that's enough shaking! The onions are ready for action! Has the American comedy show team arrived yet? iCarly? No, sir, they haven't checked in. Shame. Well, go on and mark them as a forfeit. Let them know in the booth. Yes, sir. Control booth, we have a change in the line-up. -See anyone? -All clear. -Let's go! -Come on. Come on. Hi. I see you found your hair. Oh, Oomp, you cannot be in love with a pussycat! You come from different worlds! Ow! -Okay. -Mom. -Freddie! -Pushy! None of us speak Japanese. Oh, good, he's got a Japanese-English dictionary. -Okay, he's looking up something. This is progress. He's gonna say something. Hello. -Hello. -Hello. Thank you. Thank you! Okay, we're gonna have to skip the web show from America, iCarly, because they were not able to make it here tonight, so up next for best comedy, please welcome a hometown favourite from right here in Tokyo, Kyoko and Yuki! Look. Great, we were supposed to go on before them. Those are the Internet delinquents who tricked these children and us. We were sea-weeded to massage tables. We're supposed to be out there! Lasagne. Kyoko and Yuki cheated! That's how I got this black eye. These kids are nominees. Why does your soap look like candy? I have a bladder infection. Can't you guys go get someone that speaks English? Forget it. These dough-nut holes can't understand anything. We have to communicate with these guys. -We can't. -We can't with words. -Let's act it out for them. -Act what out? Everything that's happened to us since we got to Japan. Do it! -Okay, you wanna know what happened? -Here's what happened. We do a comedy show on the web. You know, a show on the Internet. Comedy. Like... See? Comedy! You're eating too fast! You're eating too slow! -Turn the cob! -I'm not ready to turn it! Turn it! And then All five of us got on a horrible aeroplane. Aeroplane. And the plane was filled with possi. Many possums. -Poosoom? -Possum! -Poosoom. Poosoom. -Poosoom. Poosoom. So Freight Dog said we had to jump out of the plane! -Jump! -Jump? -Jump! -Jump. -Jump! Jump! Jump! -Jump! Jump! Jump! Yes. Yes. We had to jump out of the plane! -We lost the graphics. -No video feed to the big screen. -Try to fix it. Camera four. -Four up. -Jump? -Jump. -What's going on? Who are those girls? -Kill the big screen. -I can't. I don't know where the video feed's coming from. - ...with his parachute... - Parachute! His feet hit Freddie's mom in the head and knocked her down. -Kind of like this, ,, -Wait, you're not gonna, ,, Wait, those are the girls from iCarly, Isn't that the stupid security guard from outside? -Go find out where they are. -Right. And when we were checking into our hotel, this French guy... -...who's also a nominee... -...Kept butting in with his stupid puppet. And he was all, -"This is my poopit," -Stupid? "Look at my beautiful poopit." "I need a separate room for my poopit." This isn't fair! ICarly forfeited. These girls are a crack-up. Go eat your lengthy corn. Hey, I found where the signal's coming from. -should I shut it down? -No way. The audience loves them. And we thought Kyoko and Yuki were fighting for real. So Sam broke up the fight by flipping them. Sam? The video feed's coming from the utility room by the control booth. Back in a flash. And while we were with Kyoko and Yuki, my brother... -...and this lady... -...They couldn't help us 'cause they were getting massages from Kyoko and Yuki's cousins. -Massage? -Massages. Massages. See? Massages. Massages. And the next thing we knew, Kyoko and Yuki jumped in their van and ditched us! Which made us very sad. Here you are. Yes, finally. Hey, it's the iWeb guy from the v-mall. -And he speaks English! -Sweet English! Indeed. Get him some cranberry juice. ICarly people, come with me. And even though that wasn't exactly how we planned for the show to go tonight, we're very glad to have the performers... Wow, good crowd. Wait, so when do we perform? And why was that funny? You've already won. -Huh? -What do you mean? The winners of the iWeb Award for Best Web Comedy Show, iCarly! Oh, my God! -But how'd we win? -They didn't even see us perform. -Yeah, they did. -How? A little Freddie techno-magic. Oh, my God! -Yes! -Go, Freddie! -Can I touch it? -Yeah, let's do it! -We didn't do anything! -You can't do this to us! -We were in the show! -We're performers. Stop it. No, you can't do that. No! No! Stupid poopit! -I feel seasick. This is horrible. - The worst. - No kidding. You guys didn't wanna go back on Freight Dog's plane, and this was the best transportation Socko could get us. Well, Socko should stick to making socks. Don't they have any food on this boat? Oh, wait, I've got a whole bag of Japanese candy. - Awesome. - Finally. - This is soap. - Oh, yeah. L love iCarly. This cake is for you, lt says, iCarly, Carly, Sam and Freddie, And then, it says, you rock! Peace out, Bye,
