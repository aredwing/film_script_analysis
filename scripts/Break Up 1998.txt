[Chuckles] Look how sexy you were. I got laid for the first time that night. [Jimmy] So, what's wrong with the oven? It smokes when I turn it on. Probably the thermostat. Not that I use it for anything. [Phone Rings] - Hello. - Hey. They have lounge acts at work these days, Frankie? - You seen Jimmy? - She's right here. What's she doing? - Fixing my oven for me. - Tell her to pick me up. He wants you to pick him up. Okay. - [Siren Wailing] - [Rock] [Phone Ringing] Hey. Oh, hey, Jimmy. Oh, uh, Frankie left. - When? - About 15 minutes ago. - Oh, great. - Hey, are you talking about Frank Dade? Yeah. Oh, listen, this is so great. I think he may have lost my number. So, um, will you tell him... that I am in town at my brother's. And... I will be back home on... Saturday. That was his wife, goofball. Oh, my God. You're kidding! You think she'll give it to him? [Scoffs] [Car Door Shuts] - Your husband home? - I don't know. He banged my car again. - I'll tell him. - He's an asshole, your husband. Look, it makes no difference to me. I can call the cops instead. - I'll tell him. I promise. - Yeah, you tell him. Honey? Honey? Oh! You scared me. Sorry I was late picking you up. You're cooking. Looks remarkably like that. I have to go to the bathroom. I have to go. [Toilet Flushes] Do you want a drink? Hey. Is that good? - Thanks. - Sure.

All right? - [Crying Hysterically] - Hang in there. You broke your wrist, maybe a couple of ribs. We're gonna keep you here tonight. I'm going to look at your ears. Talk to me a bit. Okay? You read lips well. I said you read lips well. How long have you been deaf? A year. [Chatter] Tell me this isn't a domestic. They're not sure. Triage thinks maybe. [Man] Goddamn it. Ms. Dade, I'm Detective John Box. This is Detective Andrew Ramsey. The doctor told me that you suffer from some hearing loss. Wait a second. Wait, she can't hear? Why the hell did they stick us in here with her if she can't hear? I'll go find someone who does, uh, sign language. I know what you said. So, why don't you tell us what happened here. I fell. Where? In my house. And where's that? He knows. - Excuse me. - She says she knows who you are. Yeah, l... I heard her. Um, You know you were picked up some 18 blocks from your house. Nothing. I fell, and I don't remember much after that. You're saying this was an accident. Yes. I hope you feel better. Thank you for coming. Why don't you take my card? - Do you believe her? - No. But this is America, and, uh, you can lie all you want here. [Footsteps Approaching] [Groaning] [Gasps] We got to go. [Helicopter Blades Whirring] Oh, fuck. Jesus, you know you... You can't... Oh. Oh, God. Oh, God. Come on. I'm gonna call an ambulance. No, don't. He'll find me. - Who? - Frank. What?

I've got to warm you up. [Crying] - [Tapping Phone Keys] - [Sobs] [Line Ringing] [Beep] [TV, Indistinct] What were you doing? I called the hospital. I just wanted to find out what to do. Give me the passbook. Give me the passbook. I have some money. I'm going to go get the money tomorrow. I'm gonna go get Mom. I'm gonna leave. Okay. [Ramsey] No. No, no, no. No fucking way. I want you home at 7:00. - That's your daughter? - My wife. You did a domestic at her house, uh, last November. Yeah? God, no recollection. Look back on your notes. - My notes, right. - [Rings Doorbell] [Doorbell Rings] [Muffled] She's in there. Los Angeles Police. We need to talk with you. It's early. It's 10:00 A.M. Can we come in, please? No. Mrs. Dade, we need to speak with you, whether it's inside or outside. And it's... it's wet outside. I lost my passbook. Shit. So, uh, you had a fight with your husband, right? Why are you here? Mrs. Dade, we have a body at the morgue. We believe it may be your husband. Did your husband drive... a 1971 red Camaro, license number... Yes. [Box] We found the car at the bottom of a ravine. It may take as long as a week to make a positive identification. [Muttering] We need you to stay put for a while. [Thunder Rumbling] You know what you're gonna be looking at? Either the name on the door is wrong or there's no tag at all. It's a fucking wonder we get anything done around here. Here we go. [Gasps, Moans] Goddamn. [Ramsey] Why are these perps so stupid? You tell her to stay put, she bolts. She isn't a perp yet. [Bell Dings] Mrs. Dade, you're gonna have to come with us. We have to talk. I'm gonna take her into room two. All right. Uh, I'm gonna call again about the blood work. Please have a seat. Hey. - Are you gonna book me? - No. Right now, I just want to ask you some questions. It's... It's kind of uncomfortable to-to... I used to talk all the time. Have you... Have you ever lost someone close to you? - No. - It's wild. It's... [Sighs] It's... I, uh, I sh... I sh... I shouldn't have lied to you. What did you lie to me about? He hit me and, and pushed me down the stairs. And, and, and, uh, that's... that's all. L-I, um... I don't really... l-l-I don't know. Do you want a lawyer? - A what? - A lawyer. Why? Uh, do you need an interpreter here? - Because we can get you one. - No. John, lets talk. The blood sample is hers and his. A.D.A.'s on his way up. - We don't have enough. - Hey, we've got motive. We've got a 9-1-1. - [No Audible Dialogue] - [Jimmy Breathing Heavily] Look at her. You think she's gonna wait around for us to come up with some more evidence? I don't. We'll hold her until we get the A.D.A. - You said you weren't gonna book me. - I know. I have to pee. [Door Opens] I need a tampon. Uh, the... - Uh, there's none in there? - No. [Ramsey Sighs] All right. Uh, I got one. She can't hear you. [Footsteps Approaching] Oh, hey, excuse me. Will you do me a... Do me a favor. Will you give this to, uh, to a woman in there? Sure. [Door Closes] - [Door Opens] - There wasn't anyone else in there. [Bell Dings] You going down? [Bell Dings] Come on. Oh, shit! Get over there. You have the right to an attorney. If you cannot afford one, one will be provided for you. Goddamn it! I don't have my fucking handcuffs. [Elevator Bell Dings] Don't run. [Man] Hey. [Jimmy] Hey! Hey! It's me. Jesus, Jimmy. You scared the shit out of me. Listen, I lost my passbook, and I need to get my money. Oh, that's no problem. Just come in tomorrow. We'll take care of it. I can't. L... I gotta leave tonight. Well, honey, I'm all closed out. I can't go back in there. L-I really need it. Okay. Wait here. This is your balance. It was withdrawn this morning. - Obviously, l-I would have not if they'd come to my window. - There was $15,000. I know. You didn't call the cops just now, did you? No. Should I? Shelly? - Shelly? - [Ballad] I look to you and I see nothing I look to you to see the truth You live your life You go in shadow - You'll come apart and you'll go black - [Breathing Heavily] Some kind of night into your darkness Close your eyes with what's not there Fade into you Strange you never move [Sobbing] - Fade into you - You could have had him.

Tell him I found my passbook at home and I never go anywhere without it. Okay, she says she never goes anywhere... Tell her she needs to come in and speak with us. - He says you got to come... - She didn't do anything wrong. I promise I will help her. He says that... Are you in trouble? Just tell him I found my passbook. It was at home. It was my savings account... for my savings account. My passbook was at home. I didn't have it at home. I had it at my sister's house. - And it... it got moved somehow. - This is not cool. - Tell her not to run. - What? - What the hell is this? - Tell him what I said. - Just cool out. Everybody's talking at the same time. - Hello? Just, just, I just need you to tell him why I was saying it. - [Police Siren Wails] - I just need you to tell him what I wanted you to tell him. Hello? Mr... Hello? I'm out of here. - Hello! - You, you traced this, you jerk. [Police Radio] Unit 48, copy. [Chatter, Laughter] Mama? - Mama. - Oh. Jimmy. I thought I might come and stay for a little while, Mama. You need to deposit your Social Security check, Ma, so you can have some money. I'm putting it here. There. Where did you get this? Oh, I, uh, l-I told him that if he did God's bidding that... uh, he could take the car. Who? Who, Mama? You know, uh, he always had that thing where... he could make you... you think that you've got more than you do. Who are you talking about? Your husband, honey. He made me eggs the way I like 'em.

Please, Mama, we've got to find someplace where... where Frankie can't find us, okay? God will protect me. No, He won't. Mama, he tried to kill me. Well, that's none of my business. [Shudders] [Shouting, Screaming] - [Gasps] - I hear someone. You know, he, uh, he went to God's country. Do you remember when I used to say that we'd all be safe there? It's just a loan. I'll pay you back when I can. I love you, Mama. I love you too, honey. She kept beating on her way more than she needed to. Do you think she was strong enough to do that? If she's angry enough, yeah. Why do you think she'd kill her sister? L-I don't know. Competition? Who knows? The woman next door said she had a boyfriend. - Why don't you go talk to her? - Why? So that maybe we could find out what happened here. Our girl dinged this one. [Police Radio, Indistinct] [Camera Shutters Clicking] [Engine Starts] Bo. [Whistles] The name of the sister's boyfriend?

That's a pretty long way to come for that. - [Radio Dispatcher, Indistinct] - No one's here. [Chuckles] Somebody told you I was beating the shit out of somebody? It's probably the boob tube. It's pretty fucking violent these days. Well, we have to follow up on everything. - Have you ever seen this woman? - Which one? Foxy. No, I wish. Think she was beating me up? Nope. Other way around, friend. Can I please see some I.D.? I lost my wallet three days ago. - Ever been in a car accident, Mr... - Macy. - John, let's go. - I had a little accident at work.

Oh, this isn't police work, John, it's a fuckin' joke! - I'm tryin' to follow a lead. - We got a body fried in his car. - We got clothes on this guy we know are his. - We think are his. This guy fits every description that we've ever heard of him. If she's so fuckin' innocent, John, why does she keep running? Judge is gonna wipe our asses on this one, pal. Andy, fuck off. You fuck off! Box, phone. You have him. Yes. Am I safe? - We ever met? - You work tables in Vegas? [Scoffs] No. Spent one or two dollars there though. - Caesars, I bet. - Yeah, you got that.

[Frank] I'm entitled to a phone call! The judge is gonna wipe our asses with this flimsy evidence we got on this guy. - You know that, don't ya? - Yeah! - [Frank Screaming, Indistinct] - I could never go through what you guys go through. Too much bullshit on top of bullshit. [Sighs] Spring him. - Sorry? - Let him go. - [Frank] Come on. Let me outta here. - You sure? You didn't hear what I said? Let 'im go! [Frank] I'll calm down, okay? I'm sorry. Just open the fuckin' door! - [Chuckles] You're a funny guy. - I can sing, though. Well, what would Elvis be doing now if he were alive? I don't know. He'd be clawing the shit out of the inside of his casket. - That's okay. You're a funny guy. - I sing a little. Body in the car isn't Dade. - [Officer #1] Clear! - [Officer #2] The house is clear. - [Officer #3] Clear. - [Radio Dispatcher, Indistinct] [Phone Ringing] - [Ringing Continues] - Detective John Box. - It's me. - Mrs. Dade?

[Whispering] He hit me so hard... that l... I didn't... I couldn't sit up for three days. So you think I'm the biggest asshole on the face of the earth. Stand in line. I took this from your house. It wasn't Frank's money. - Grace. - [Gasps] [Knocking] [Neighbor's Voice] He's an asshole, your husband. It makes no difference to me. I can call the cops instead. [No Audible Dialogue] [Frank] How do you know she's there? [Grace] It was on the envelope. [Radio] I'm gonna get something to drink. You wanna go? - Uh, um... D-Do you have a phone? - Yeah.

I never would have left you otherwise. You know that, right? You... put the neighbor in your car. You killed him and put him in your car. What was I supposed to do? Can we go? Really? Yes. I'm sorry, Jim. I'm so sorry. Me too. - [Gunshot] - [Groans] You shot me. [Screaming, Moaning] [Labored Breathing] There's your gun back. [Chamber Clicks] This is your mess. You deal with it.

Your husband... was a very bad egg. Huh? He killed your neighbor, he killed your sister... and... I thought he was gonna kill me, so I shot him. You understand? - Yes. - Good. Bus stop, over there.
