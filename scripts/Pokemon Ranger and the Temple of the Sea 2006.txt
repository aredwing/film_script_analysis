They fill the oceans, thrive in the mountains, soar high over the horizons, and share the sparkling landscapes of cities. Try and count them if you dare. But then, try and count the grains of sand on your favorite beach. Mankind and Pokmon alike have long journeyed together to experience the thrill and challenge of the Pokmon battle, living and learning together as teammates... sometimes opponents, yes, but ever friends. Yet there are those who blindly take advantage of a Pokmon's trust to further their own selfish, egotistical ambitions in the name of darkness. But as the pendulum swings both ways, there are the Pokmon Rangers as well, whose job it is to protect Pokmon and protect nature, reflecting the balance that is nature. Which also happens to hold within its protecting arms a young man we know as Ash Ketchum of Pallet Town, who, along with his beloved Pikachu, has set his sights on nothing less than becoming a Pokmon master, sharing his dreams with some equally dedicated friends, a microcosm of the vast world of Pokmon and people together, experiencing the sorts of things one might expect... or not. But living their dreams nonetheless, for this is part of the journey. This is the journey. And the world of Pokmon is about to present our heroes with a new role, a shift, a journey until now for them, unimagined. - Corsol. - Corsol. - Corsol. - Corsol. - Corsol. - Corsol. - Corsol. - Corsol. Clam! Cloyster. Ooh! Horsea! Tam! Manta! I have target confirmation. Currently riding the tide and heading southeast. Distance to target... 50. Recover now! Roger. Recover now! Now! Now! Recovery complete. Surfacing to retrieve helicopter. - Galen! - Huh? Remember, there are two types of men in this world... those who have unlimited desires and those who do not! Oh! This is sure to give me that which I desire. Wait for me, my sea crown. Hmm? What? Who are you? You want this to satisfy your selfish desires. Not happening. Seize him! Now! Seize him! Ohh! Bye! - Huh? - Traitor! Stop him! Excuse me. I'm not a traitor. I was never on your side! Ow! Aah! Hello, there, Headquarters. This is Jack Walker checking in. Well, well, Jackie. You're late. EOP confirmed. EOP? You mean "Equal Opportunity Publications"? "Egg of the Prince. " So, pretty cool name, huh? You can't just make up names. Look, first, I get stuck on this ship, scrubbing stinking floors for a solid month. Couldn't you think of something nicer to say? As soon as our work is through. There's a lot left. You man enough? I don't know the meaning of the word "failure. " - You don't? - Huh? Would you like to borrow my dictionary? No, thanks. Ha! - Oh! - Aah! Ugh! There he is! I'll just take that off your hands now. Pinsir! Parasect! Give it up. Give it up! I don't know the meaning of the phrase "give it up. " Capiche? Really? I'll lend you my dictionary. Keep it. Huh? Capture on! Capture complete. Now, Mantine! Ooh. Ha! Whoo! That's Mantine's Confuse Ray! And it works great. Pinsir, Pinsir. Pinsir, Pinsir. Pokmon Ranger, eh? Oh, just tell me again, Brock. Are you really sure this is the right way to go? I used to think so, but now I'm not so sure. We haven't seen a town or anything. And the Pokmap's not picking up a signal at all. It appears that nature's protecting arms have gotten quite a bit warmer than our heroes would like. And although hoping for a quick arrival in the next town, their hopes have been dashed as they sadly conclude they've now lost their way, wandering in a veritable wasteland. Man, I'm so thirsty. Give me some water, okay? Just don't drink it all. I won't. Thanks. Aah! Max, I told you not to drink it all, didn't I? It wasn't exactly full, you know. But now that I know there's none left, I'm even thirstier than ever. Water. Hmm? Huh? Ah! One, two, three. Go! Wow! What's all that? Hello! - Hmm? Can we have some water? Okay. All right! Whoa! Hi, there. Who are you? My name's Ash. And I'm Max. And I'm May. We've been traveling, and I think we got lost. Pika! Pika! Poliwhirl! - Poli! - Poli! Pikachu! That's what you were doing. They're using Psychic. Huh? Huh. Hmm. Hmm. You're in the Marina Underwater Pokmon Show, correct? That's right. And your name is Lizabeth, and you're the star of the show. Right again. Awesome! The name is Brock, my dear. I happen to know all about the Marina Group! Here! It's my blue book. There. See? You're the tippy-top of my all-time favorite stars list. This has got to be destiny, meeting you here like this! Yes, take my hand. And now that we're holding hands, I would love to go on a swimming date with you and all your wonderful Pokmon... Aah! Now that I'm holding your ear, I'd like to take you away. Lizabeth, what's wrong? Grandpa, it's okay. These people were on the road and got lost. You must all be her family. Yes. That's right. Grandad and Dad. - Hi. I'm Ship. - And I'm Kyle. The name's Meredith. Don't tell me. You're not her mom? - Yes, I am. - Wow! You look like you could be her sister. Oh, go on, dear. I mean, go on! Aah! - Wooper. - Wooper. - Wooper. - Wooper. - Wooper. - Wooper. Politoed. Politoed. Politoed. Politoed. Politoed. Politoed. Politoed. Politoed. Mmm. Ah! That's good. Ah! The best. Oh, yeah. Pika! I've never petted a Buizel before. Buizel really likes you. Anybody ready for some more? Oh, yeah, please. Me too! Pika! Huh? Excuse me. Your show sounds really cool. What do you do in it? Would you like a sample? - Yeah! - Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Then we'll just have to show you! Ooh! Ooh! Ah! Mm! Mm! Mm! Mm! Buizel. B- B-B... Hmm. Look at that. Oh. Hmm? Bui. So, how would you all like a lift to the next town? - Yeah. - That'd be great. Huh? Bui. - Hmm. - What are you gawking at? The Team Rocket Gazette. Yes! Right there! Looky. That's what the twerpette had in tow. Pursued by the Phantom, too. There's big money to be made from this kind of dirt. Why not phone Phantom? I would think clueing him in on this would entitle us to a piece of what must be big treasure. Love that word. Hello. Is this 1-800-PHANTOM? It's about the item you've been searching for. Yes, that one! - We've got to go! - Hmm? Got to run. I'm all out of quarters. Wait for me! Bui. Bui. Bui. Hu! Gorebyss! Oh! - Chinchou! - Chinchou! - Chinchou! - Chinchou! Mana! Mana! Mana! Mana! Whee! Mana! Mana! Wait! Don't go! Don't go! Stop! What's wrong, May? Uh, nothing. - Morning. - Bui. Uh, right. Good morning. And in. Out. Steady, boy. Right. Bui. Pika. Pika. Bui. Presenting your freshly baked pizza. Down we go. - In we go. - In we go. Don't worry, treasure. Jessie's here to bring your valuable self home. No hiding. Last night I had the strangest dream. - Really? - Yeah. A Pokmon I'd never seen before was traveling to some sort of an underwater sea temple. Mana! Mana! Mana! Mana! I really wanted to go along, too. Sea temple? I'd sure like to go there. Pika. Yeah, but it was just a dream. Father. I've heard of stranger things than that. Tell me, have you ever heard of the People of the Water? Why, no. Who are they? You two do the honors. Truth is, I've had exactly the same dream. Oh? You see, our family is made up of descendants of the ones that have been called the People of the Water. Right. And there aren't that many of us left. Mm. Amazing. - Whoa! - Whoa! Hmm? Ooh! - Here we go. - Huh? Not another egg. Another egg, my eye. - Aah! - Huh? Oh! Aah! Aah! Aah! Aah! Oh, that was "eggs-treme. " Huh? What do you think you're doing with James' voice? Yikes! The same thing you're doing with Jessie's! I'm swearing off egg jokes! Bu! Bu! Pika? The People of the Water traveled the oceans and lived together in peace and harmony with the water Pokmon. So in order to receive the ocean's blessings and show their gratitude to the Pokmon, our ancestors built what has come to be known as the Sea Temple. That must be the one in your dream. - You even got the name right. - Wow. The People of the Water still see the temple in their dreams. A memory written straight into your DNA? That's just awesome. Why did May have the dream? Maybe that means May's a descendant of the People of the Water... and me too! Could be. Why not? Stop being me! Don't you see I look ridiculous? You're not the only one, lady! Oh, no. What if the boss finds out? Easy. Deny everything. Easy? What kind of dope are you? Team Rocket! Okay, what are you doing here? Prepare for trouble with the things you see. These earrings are just not me. An evil as old as the galaxy. Sent here to fulfill our destiny. Meowth! That's me! - This isn't working. - Who cares? With this baby, we'll never have to work again. Sounds good. What's that? - Huh? - Huh? Aah! What I wouldn't give right now for my beautiful long legs. How does Meowth do it? Out of the way, short stuff! Whee! Eat my dust, peewee pegs! Shut up! I won't forget this! Huh? And it's lift-off from Loser Land! Pikachu, Thunderbolt! Pika! - Hold on. - Pika? They've got something very important. We can't risk damage. Right. Huh? A Fearow. Capture on! Ha! Ha! A Pokmon Ranger? Worse than short legs. Fearow, lend me your power! Pikachu, you go, too. Pika. Huh? Oh! Pika. Wait! Come on! Must it get personal? Oh! Better not let go! - Oh! - Oh! Aah! Meowth, do something right now! Me? You're Meowth! Aah! Where's a good shrink when you need one? - We're blasting off again! - We're blasting off again! Pika! Pika! You were a great help, Fearow. Thanks a lot. Hey, that's a Capture Styler. Does that mean... - You're a Pokmon Ranger? - You're a Pokmon Ranger? Mm-hmm. Jack Walker. Call me Jackie, please. I'm on a mission right now. And the Marina Group is helping me out with it in a big way. Glad to help, Jackie. I'm sorry we couldn't tell you. This is the egg of a Pokmon called Manaphy. Manaphy? Pika. I've heard of it. It's a Pokmon that travels the oceans. Sounds to me like you study quite a lot, Max. I read that it's super-rare and hardly anybody's ever seen one before. Right. My mission is to see that this Manaphy egg gets properly hatched and then delivered to Samiya, the Sea Temple. Then that's the temple I saw in my dream! Correct. And that must have been Manaphy. You mean you saw it in your dream? Uh-huh. You're lucky, May. - Pika? - Huh? Aah! - Huh? - What's wrong, Buizel? Pika. - Huh? - Huh? Target is confirmed and within our sights. Within our sights! They must have followed us all the way here. We've got to hurry and get back to the trailer. - But what about... - Max, hurry! Huh? - Aah! - Aah! - The Beedrills! - Run! Remember, there are only two types of people on this planet... those who are chased and those who do the chasing. I know which is better. I go for the role of chaser every time. Pokmon Ranger! Now I suggest it's time for you to learn the meaning of "give up" once and for all. It's a shame you have to travel here all that way, but I'm afraid you have to go home empty-handed. Why, you impudent... Why, you impudent... Come back here! Give me that. Now! Well, if you want it that bad, here you go! Huh? You're not getting away with this! Man, you're strong, Phantom. You take vitamins? Ash! All right. There you are! We've got to get out of here quick! Pika. You think you're so smart. Now, Beedrill! Use Pin Missile! Pikachu, use Thunderbolt! Pika! Let's go! Stop them with Sludge Bomb, Beedrill! Aah! Hey, May! Back to the trailer! Those guys are all after the egg. Got it, Ash. Pikachu, Volt Tackle! Pika! Pika, Pika! Huh? What's going on? It's glowing. Now, give me that! Give me that! Max, hurry! Now... that belongs to me. No! Manaphy doesn't belong to anyone! Anything that has no owner belongs to me. Ohh! Don't you dare hurt my sister! Hey! Give that to me! It's mine! Oh! - Oh! - Oh! Mana? Phy! Phy! Oh! Oh, no. It's okay. Yes, everything's going to be just fine. Just fine. The egg hatched. That's it. That's it. That's it. Yes! But I was gonna use my own two hands to hatch Manaphy. Manaphy! Manaphy! Everybody okay? Over here! - Huh? - Huh? Quick. Stop! No, home is that way! That's it. Take a trip! Aah! Phy! Phy! Phy! Phy! There, there. There, there. Don't cry, sweetie. Don't cry, sweetie. Don't cry. Phy. Mana? Hey, thanks, Lizabeth. - I think. - Bui! Phy. Phy. I think we're finally calming down. Manaphy must be tired. - I can take over for you now. - Thanks. Mana! Mana! No. Not again. Stop, please. May, I'm afraid Manaphy prefers you. Mana! # Da-da-da # - # Da-da-da # - Mana! Oh. I'm getting the feeling that Manaphy thinks you're its mother. - Huh? - I think she's right. Often, whoever a Pokmon sees after hatching is assumed to be its mother. So I'm a... a mom? - Yep. - Pika. Pika. Pika! What's up? Pika. Pika, Pika. - They're back! - Pika! Stop the trailer now. Stop now! - Oh! - Oh! - Oh! - Oh! Quick! Everybody move up to the front! May! Help me! Lizabeth! Phy. Phy. It's okay, Manaphy. Mana? Phy. Everything will be fine. Guess it's not easy being a mom. Thanks for the wisdom, Max. Mana. It's got to be near here. Just a little farther. I just had the worst dream. For some strange reason, I was Meowth. Really? Weird. I was you. Yeah. I was you. Blue hair and all. Then it couldn't have been a dream, could it? Wobbuffet! Mime, Mime, Mime! Now, what are you two doing? Wobbuffet! Mime, Mime, Mime! It's the twerp truck! - Mime! - Wob! We've still got it. Oh, yeah. Guess if you want something bad enough. I did it! Come on, they didn't find this place because of you. Did too, and I'm sure there's a reward. We want the whole treasure! Hold on. I think our boy is onto something. It's time to retool. Do you have any water-type Pokmon? Yeah. In that case, it's your turn. A dead end? Watch. These ruins were left by the People of the Water, which means that must be who they are. Phy! Mana! - Mana! - Pika? Mana! - Oh! - Oh! - Hmm. - Hmm. Dewgong, return. Good work. Thank you. It's exactly like I saw it in my dream. Huh? It's the temple, Samiya. Samiya? Within the temple, there is a treasure called the Sea Crown. Sea Crown? Many thieves have appeared over the years attempting to steal the Sea Crown. So to protect the treasure and the temple itself, the People of the Water set traps within the temple. What kind? The Sea Temple can't be seen by the eyes of the mortals. Wow! How is that? It blends in with the water. Once, the temple was carried away by the tides. And since then, the temple has drifted along the ocean continuously, making it impossible to find. However, the temple appears now only at the time of the total eclipse of the Moon. That's when the People of the Water were said to have held their festival honoring the water Pokmon. Wow. A temple that travels the ocean. But wait. Since it can't be seen, how do you find it? We think Manaphy can. Mana! The People of the Water originally built the temple in the exact same place where the Manaphy lived. Even after the temple began to move about freely, all Manaphy have been born with a kind of homing instinct, which allows them to locate the temple at any time. So as long as we've got Manaphy, we'll be able to find the temple. So that's why all those men were all after Manaphy. - Mm. - Mm. They wanted to steal the Sea Crown. We must protect the Sea Temple at all costs. We must also protect Manaphy at all costs, especially from the crusty old codger with the beard. So, who is that guy? Phantom the Pirate. Phantom the Pirate. He's one mean dude. Search inside. Search inside. - Yes, sir! - Yes, sir! - The man of the hour! - The man of the hour! Who are you? I'm James from Team Rocket, humbly happy to have tipped you off to those twerps. I'm Jessie. I'm Meowth. Give them their reward. Give them their reward. Yes, sir. Thank you, Your Highness. You're too kind. Word out on the street is that you're the pirate's pajamas. Perhaps you could use some extra dirty hands. How are you at cleaning? - The dirtiest. - The dirtiest. It appears that the People of the Water employed quite an elaborate system of water routes for their trade. So it's difficult to pinpoint their exit. They're now heading for the Sea Temple, so let us go and wait for them to fall into our trap. Our trap! I'll get the Sea Crown if it's the last thing I do. The Sea Crown? The mother lode. Putting a capital "T" on "treasure. " - Treasure. - Still love that word. Mm-hmm. Hmm. Wow! - Oh! - Oh! I want to thank you kids. You've all been a big help to me up to this point. But now... Once we get out of this grotto, I'm leaving. What? Mana! You see, you've gotten too involved as it is. How come? This has to be a Pokmon Ranger's job. Aah! Sorry to keep you waiting. Thank you. Manaphy's sound asleep. Must be tired. Yeah, after a day like we just had. Not to mention the fact that Manaphy's still only a baby. They're here. That's my ship, all right. The Blue Lagoon. - That's your ship? - Pika! Right. I traveled the whole world on that ship when I was a young man. You've kept my boat shipshape all these years. Always feel free to use it. But we want to go with you! There's still so many good times left to share. All of your kind words are plenty. Captain! We'll have a drink upon my return. Take care. But, Captain Ship! Ohh! Safe trip! Bye, Captain! Bye, Lizabeth! I'll miss you! Phy. Man. I wish we could have gone. There's so much more I want to learn about Manaphy. And there's so much more I want to learn about Lizabeth! It's frustrating just seeing them off like this. Pika. I feel so strange. What is it? Mana! Mana! Mana! Mana! Mana! Mana! Being young means you never turn away from adventure, you know. What are you afraid of? This is your chance. If you want to go, then you should go. There's nothing worse than regret, kid. Pika! - Hey, guys! - Wait up! Hey, hold on, everybody! We want to go with you, too! I'm coming, Manaphy! It's May. And Ash. Mana! Phy! Aah! This is weird. What in the world is happening to me? What am I doing here? Phy! Hey! You forgot me! Stop that ship! This won't work. Manaphy, you did this? Mana! Mana! Mana! What are you gonna do? Pika? Whoa, I'm back to normal. You and I switched bodies. Is that one of Manaphy's powers? Yeah, it's called Heart Swap, and it's one of the ways Manaphy avoids danger. The effect wears off after a little while. Though I'm not sure what will happen if you get too far away. Wow. Amazing. Hey, that's the Prince of the Sea. Who's the Prince of the Sea? That's what they call Manaphy. Say, Manaphy, you didn't want me to leave? Is that why you switched Ash and Jackie? Mana, Mana! You make me so happy. Happy! Happy! You were talking! Really? Are you sure. Sure, I'm sure. - Say "happy. " - Happy! Hear that? Manaphy's saying what I say. Pika! Well, I remember the first thing that Lizabeth said was "foo-foo. " - That means "food," right? - Uh-huh. - You sure loved to eat. - What? Say "Ash," Manaphy. - Come on and say "Ash. " - Now say "Hi, Max. " Mana. Wow! I heard you say "Max. " Didn't sound like "Max" to me. No? Happy. - You're so cute! - Happy. All right, May, you can release Manaphy now. Now? From now on, Manaphy needs to choose its own path. By itself? Right. It's the way that it has to be. All that we can do is just watch. Time for you to go, Manaphy, by yourself. Mana! Are you ready to go? Mana! Mana! Okay. Mana! Mana! Mana! Phy! Phy! Good. Let's go. All right, down this way. - Whoa! - Whoa! Wow! Pika! It's like an aquarium! Manaphy! Bui! Mana! Phy! Come on. Okay. It doesn't hurt. Phy? Mana! Mana! Mana! Mana! Mana! Mana! Mana! Mana! All alone. That's the way Manaphy will travel the entire ocean, finally returning to its home, which is the Sea Temple. But how? How does Manaphy know where to go? It's so strange. The total lunar eclipse is coming soon. If our timing is just right, we might get a chance to view the Sea Temple with our own eyes. And receive the blessings of the sea, as the People of the Water did. This is Jack Walker here, en route, no problems. Jackie, please. Save the vacation for when you're done. Okay. But there's not a single bad guy in sight, so just relax. Being a Pokmon Ranger is just so cool. Pikachu. Phy! Phy! - Oh! - Bui! - Oh! - Oh! Manaphy's sitting on that Wailord. Look at that. Hi, Manaphy! Hap! Py! Happy! Bui! Bu, Bu. Bui! Shh! Pika. Hey, so, why'd you become a Pokmon Ranger in the first place, Jackie? I was a kid. I got stuck, and these Pokmon saved my life. I was hiking up in the mountains when a sudden blizzard came up, trapping me. It just kept blowing harder and harder. I thought that was the end for sure. I'd never experienced bitter cold like that before. When, all of a sudden, this group of migrating forest Pokmon was there. And one by one, they started to gather 'round me, like a bunch of hot-water bottles. You're so warm. If they hadn't been so kind to me back then, I wouldn't be here today. I guess I wanted to be a Pokmon Ranger ever since. Wow. Great story. Pika, Pika. I was about the same age as you. Yeah? Cool! All right, Ranger Ash, let 'er rip! Phy! Mana! Mana! Mana! Pikachu. Bui! Phy! Bui! Pika! Mana! I love you, Manaphy. Can you say, "I love you"? Love? "Love you. " Mana love. "Love you. " Love you. Right! "Love you"! Mana love you! Phy! Lap! Mana! Mana! Mana! Mana! Manaphy sure looks happy. Pika. You don't think Manaphy will get lost. Don't you worry, May. But... Come on. You worry too much. Children need freedom to grow, or else, you know. Oh, who asked you, Max? Manaphy! Love! Love you! You're really quite a chef. Hey, thanks, Lizabeth. Perhaps you could teach my daughter how to cook. Bui! Bui, Bui. Mana! Mana! Mana! Ah. Ash, I need to ask you a favor. What is it? Please help separate Manaphy and May. But they're having so much fun. Why would I do that? If those two continue to get closer and closer, Manaphy won't want to leave. And then... Please. You won't have to worry. May. I'll be fine. I promise. What about Manaphy? Put yourself in Manaphy's place for just a moment. Oh. Remember, Manaphy is the Prince of the Sea and destined to become leader of all the Sea Temple Pokmon. I hadn't thought of that. You can't expect Manaphy to stay with you forever. That's the way of nature. Happy! Happy, happy! I'm sorry. Happy! Happy! Love you! Happy! Lizabeth, hi. I know it's hard. - Lan! - Lan! I've seen no evidence they have any idea we're following them. And let's keep it that way until they reach the temple. Reach the temple. Yes, sir. Hey, guys, the old treasure meter's going off the charts. It won't be long now. We'll clean up in more ways than one. That old crusty crab thinks he's so smart, when we're the ones poised to pocket those diamonds and pearls. Hey, that sounds like a good name for a gang. Wobbuffet! # Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh # Hear that? That's Manaphy singing. Yeah. Pika. # Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh # # Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh # Prince of the Sea. Isn't Manaphy amazing? Here, May, I want you to have this. The People of the Water's mark. I'd like for you to wear it. Thank you, Lizabeth. Tonight's the night. The total lunar eclipse. I hope we're on time. It's up to Manaphy and the whimsy of the ocean. I guess so. Manaphy, it's time to eat. Mana! Mana! Happy? Happy? Guess Manaphy's looking for May. - Pika. - Happy? Mm-hmm. Come out, everybody. Donphan! Aipom! Corphish! - Swellow! - Sceptile! Phy! Phy! Donphan! Mana! Swellow! Mana! Phy! Swellow! Mana! Mana! Phy! Swellow! Scep. Scep! Tile! Swell! Mana! Corphish. Cor. - Mana! - Cor! - Phy! - Corphish. - Mana. - Corphish. - Mana. - Corphish. - Mana, Mana. - Corphish. - Mana, Mana. - Corphish. Mana! Mana! Mana! Corphish! Mana! Mana! - Mana! - Cor, Cor! Mana! Sharpedo. Mana. Mana! Shar. Mana. Hun. Mana? Mana! Cor! Corphish! Corphish! Corphish! Cor? Cor, Cor. Manaphy still hasn't come back yet? No. I'm getting worried. Is something wrong? Now, don't do anything rash. Of course not. It's because of the way I treated Manaphy. That's not true. You can't blame yourself. Sir, they've just launched a submarine. It's heading straight for the bottom. Fine. From this point on, I'm going it alone. Alone! - Wait for my signal. - Yes, sir. And that will be just as soon as the Sea Crown is mine. Mana! Mana! Canth. Chinchou. Chinchou. Chinchou. Chinchou. Chinchou. Chinchou. Mana! Mana. Cloyster. Mana! Happy, happy! Mana! Hun! Clamperl. Clamperl. Octil. Manaphy, where are you? It's me. I'm right here. Please be okay. Pika! Phy! Manaphy! Love you. Happy, happy! But, Manaphy, that's what you were looking for? Happy. Love you. And I love you, too. Aw. Pika. And that's what happened. Manaphy was just looking for May's bandana. Now, that's some great news. Of course, you'll all be back for supper. In that case, I could use a little help. Don't worry. Brock and I will cook as soon as we get back. Oh! Lizabeth, what's wrong? I think we're caught in a riptide. - What? - I've lost control! - Aah! - Aah! Lizabeth! Lizabeth! The radio's dead. Phy! Manaphy! Mana! Mana! We should go that way. Lizabeth. I'm on it. We're out of the current. Thanks to Manaphy. Mana! Mana! The lunar eclipse has begun. The current has calmed down, and it appears they've all escaped unharmed. Corphish! Wonderful. They're being followed. By what? Hmm. What? What? They're gone! That can't be. They've gone where? I think I know. - Hmm. - Hmm. It won't be long. Almost there. - The Sea Temple! - The Sea Temple! Wait. What's that? It's Phantom! We can breathe in here. And we're still so far underwater. Pretty cool, all right. Manaphy! Manaphy! Phy! Happy! Manaphy. Happy. Love you. Love you, too. Happy, happy. Pikachu. Mana? Happy? Phy! - Ah! - Ah! # Ooh-ooh, ooh ooh-ooh # # Ooh-ooh, ooh ooh-ooh # # Ooh-ooh, ooh ooh-ooh # # Ooh-ooh, ooh ooh-ooh # Is that the temple responding to Manaphy's song? # Ooh-ooh, ooh ooh-ooh # That's got to be the People of the Water, for sure! Mana! Mana! Mana! Mana! Mana! Eureka! The Sea Temple! The Sea Temple! The Sea Temple! Of course, that would include my beloved Sea Crown. Beloved Sea Crown! Oy! My legs! What legs? - Treasure. - Diamonds and pearls. Let's get through this season first. Ahhh. Mana! Mana, Mana! Mana! Mana! - What's this? - Pika? The sign of the Sea Crown! - Ohh. - Huh? But what's it say? I don't know, Max. Maybe Grandpa can read it. Would you like me to tell you what it says, then, kids? Phantom! It's the least I can do to thank you for guiding me here. No way! I warn you... Even if you are to attack me all at once, you wouldn't stand a chance. Stand a chance! - Oh, yeah? - Pika! You know you have no power here. This temple belongs to the People of the Water. I happen to know everything about the People of the Water. Everything! "Beyond this door, which may only be opened with the People of the Water's mark, lies the crown. And whosoever shall wear this crown shall be known as the King of the Sea. " As thanks for guiding me here, I shall be kind enough to let you view the Sea Crown. That's the People of the Water's mark. And I went through a lot to get it. A lot to get it! A lot to get it! Whoa! Fantastic! It's over now. Ahhh. Finally, the Sea Crown. And now it's all mine. All mine! All mine! - What a sight! - Amazing. Remember, there are two types of men in this world of ours... those who look good with rare jewels and those who do not. For my money, the Sea Crown and I are a match made in the heavens above. Mana! Mana, Mana! Mana! Mana! Mana, Mana! Mana! Mana! Mana! Manaphy! That looks fun. Hmph. Mana, Mana! - Ugh! - Mana! Manaphy! Mana! Mana! Mana! What did you do? You can't take that! I've risked everything to capture the Sea Crown. And from now on, it belongs to me. Huh? Oh, no! What happened? - Aah! - Aah! Aah! Max, hold on! Let's go. We got to get back to the sub. Wait! Aah! Huh? Come on! Everybody okay? Jackie! - Where's Phantom? Back there. He took several jewels from the Sea Crown. And all this water started coming in. I'll take care of Phantom. You get out of here. The temple is sinking. It's sinking? Lizabeth, take care of everyone. Right. Wait! It's bad in there! Don't worry, Ash. I'll be fine. I'm a Ranger, right? - Hang in there, Jackie! - Pika! Let's move! - Not bad for an old man. - Hmm? But this belongs to the People of the Water and the water Pokmon. You seem to have forgotten that. No! This is all mine now. All mine now! It is, huh? Your mind's on the fritz. I'll fix that! They're mine! Why, you impudent twit! Aaah! Well, Pokmon Ranger, your time is up. Time is up! Time is up! Unless I do something, both of our times are up. Impossible. I'm just getting started! - Aaah! - Aaah! Aah! No! Stop! Don't go! Phy! Mana! Hurry. We have to go. Right. - Mana! Mana! Mana! Manaphy! May! No! Ash! May! Wait! Manaphy, where are you going? Manaphy must be trying to save the temple. Pikachu. Mana! Mana! Mana! Mana! It's the Sea Crown. Down there! Phy! Phy! Phy! Manaphy! Manaphy's trying to get the temple back to the way it was before. And that's what we're gonna do, too. Pika! We need one more. Oh, no. Did Phantom have one? - Phy. - Pika. So it is sinking. He was right. He was right! Let's go. This joint's full of treasure if you're thirsty. Hurry, there's barely enough room for the three of us! How did you all get here? Get out of there this instant! There's no room in this tub for a tub! Try a cruise ship! Go walk the plank, crank! Yeah? Well, I've got a plank just for you! - Aah! - Aah! Whoa! Aaah! We're blasting off again! Want to come? Want to come! Want to come! It looks like Jackie managed to get out of there. Huh? But May and Ash... Oh, no. We're being pushed away. Not again! We just ran through here. Pika! Pikachu! Huh? Got it! Pika! But how'd it get here? I'm not surprised, with all the flooding going on. So all we do is put it back. - Look out! - Huh? It's the Phantom's. Huh? May, get in here. It's Phantom's. Come on. You got to. Pikachu, you take care of the two of them. I have to go put this back. Now you guys just sit tight in there and wait. - But, Ash! - Pikachu! Oh, no. No, you don't! Hurry. Pika. Jackie, you all right? I'm just fine. Where are the kids? May and Ash haven't come back yet. What the... Please, Ash, don't give up. Pikachu. Please, Ash. Ash, don't give up. Ash, be strong! Pika. I know you can do it. I know! Pikachu! Mana! Mana, Mana! Hey, look! Kyogre! Pika. Pika. Ash. Ash must have done this. Pika. Phy! It can't be. No way. Pika. Mana! - You will be coming with me! - Mana! Manaphy! As long as you're by my side, I can always find the temple. Then I can take what truly belongs to me. Huh? What's that? - Ash! - Pikachu! Grr! Hey, Phantom! I'm taking Manaphy back! You are? Let's see you try. Corphish! - Hey, it's Ash! - But how? Whosoever shall wear this crown shall be known as King of the Sea. And it's true. Behold the Sea Crown. It is the touchstone between the People of the Water and the water Pokmon. Where are you going? Hmm? Aah! I got you! Why, you... Aah! Mana! Mana! - Ash got Manaphy. - Pikachu! - Uh-oh. - Huh? Ahh! It's the Wailord. They're doomed. Crush them all! Yes, sir. Supersonic away! The Pokmon are all in a confused state. - What's going on? - I don't know. Pika. Very soon I shall be known as King of the Sea! - Mana! - Huh? Ooh-ooh. Ooh ooh-ooh. Ooh-ooh. Ooh ooh-ooh. Ooh-ooh. Ooh ooh-ooh. Ooh-ooh. Ooh ooh-ooh Ooh-ooh. Ooh ooh-ooh. Ooh-ooh. Ooh ooh-ooh Manaphy's singing calmed them all right down! The way only Manaphy knows how. Mana! Ow! Ow! We've lost power! Sir, I'm afraid we're sailing blind. Why, you cursed Pokmon. Huh? Mana! There are two types of men in this world... those who are completely crushed and those who do the crushing. What's he wearing? A mecha suit? Wow. I didn't think a guy like that took vitamins. - Vitamins! - Pika. I'm not the type to be crushed. Nope. Not me. Bleh! Phy! Manaphy! Manaphy! Phy! Pikachu. Oh, so that's the Sea Crown. Sea Crown! Bleh. - Pika. - And Manaphy's going, too. Hope we meet again. I'm sure you will, Max. Me too. This is Jack Walker. Mission complete. Nice work, Jackie. Bye. Mana! Mana! Mana! Manaphy! Manaphy! I'm so proud of you and all that you've done. Mana! You won't forget me, will you? Love you, May. Goodbye. Love you. Love you, Mama. Love you, May. Eeee! Mana! Mana! I'm gonna miss Manaphy. Yeah. - Pika. May, are you all right? No, I'm not all right.
