I was wondering if you would like to accompany me to dinner, sometime. I know this nice Italian place, we can go. Uh... I can pick you up... at uh... 9ish. Uh... at 8 OK. Uh..., well... I see you there. Danny? He just seems so mysterious. Who is it? Please tell me! I'm not telling you. OK. Is it... James McCarthy? Oh come on, please tell me. There is no point in letting me guessing. Not Steven Fields! No! Please give me some clues then. Uh..., he has brown hair Oh my god Pippa I know who it is, Greg Barcklet. Greg Barcklet! Oh my god. Rachel calm down. I don't believe it. You are gonna snog him tonight. Aren't you? I didn't think he was your type. He is not. Then who is? Mrs. Hatcher is such a caw, I'm not even gonna bother with the homework. Why should I, it doesn't get me anywhere. What has RA to do with my career? My mom said you wanna be a priest. Your mom is a priest! Right Barcklet, I have been looking for you. Go on what is it? I want your Game Boy and tensions for 2 weeks. Trust me it is well worth it. What is? Someone fancies you badly and they are really fit. This better be good or I'm having it back. Come on! Pippa! I probably get off with her tonight. Tongues as well. See, what you lacking is charisma that is why women likes me. I'm charismatic! You, you are like a pair damp flannels. You are never going to get a girl like that. You are like yoghurt boys, no substance! You want that? Uh..., imagine you get one with braces. All that metal in her, I bet she rips your tongue right off. Stop eating my mouse, please. I thought you didn't want it. Why would you think that? Take mine... I'm not interested in it at all. It's only mouse. Not to me, it isn't. You don't havening it. Uh..., hi, do you mind if I... sit here. Can I sit here where you are? OK. Oh..., sorry. You are going tonight? Yeah. You? Yeah. Should be fun. Yeah. Anyone you like? No... not really. And you? Uh... yeah there is someone actually. You alright Pippa? Yeah, thanks. Uh..., uh..., I get to go. See you later. Yeah. We should... get back to the register. I catch you later. You alright? Yeah. He was there, right next to me. I should have said something. I can't believe it's tonight. I'm so excited. I don't know what to do. You just go up them and tell him. I'm sure he will be over the moon. But what if he laughs at me or says no. He won't say no. I think I fancy Dominic. Lucky you. He smiled at me again today. You two go together really well. Was she... really looking forward to it now? I'm going to ask her out tonight. She wants me. I now just wait and play hard to get. My dad, says, I just get stuck in. And he knows what he is talking about. Is..., isn't your dad a plumber? Yeah, so? At least he can afford to buy me new trainers. Stop it. What? I said stop it, it's enough. I'm only winding him up. It..., it is a bit annoying sometimes. Sorry. Gosh, you two are such pussies, sometimes. Uh... I'm going outside for a minute. You alright? Yeah... I just came to get some fresh air. Mate..., just..., just go for it. You can't use this door! Why not? This is the outdoor it is to ease congestion in the passing zone. Go on, she is waiting. Would you... like to dance? What..., what do you think you are doing? I like that. But..., Deany said..., he said you fancied me. Greg... I should go... and talk to him. I'm sorry about that. It's alright. I didn't really fancy her anyway. You know there are million of girls there that would love to go out with you. You reckon? Definitely! You really like her, don't you? Come on, let's go in. +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ + | T | h | e | | D | e | a | f | | B | o | y | s | | F | o | r | | B | o | y | s | | G | r | o | u | p | + +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ E N J O Y this SRT SUBTITLE R e l e a s e Disco (2010) English for hearing-impaired.srt Or: Disco (2010) English for hearing-impaired.srt (including ALL sound bites & songs!)
