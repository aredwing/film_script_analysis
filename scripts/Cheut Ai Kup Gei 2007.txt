Beat 2, second round for lunch. 2537. Yes Sir. Beat 3, first round, 338. Yes Sir. Beat 4, second round. 4719, 7558. Yes Sir. Describe it please... What kind of phone? C582. - What colour? - Red. Where did you lose it? MTR Station. Which Station? Tsuen Wan. What's your name? Chan Lok Ying. Sit here. Hello Yip. What's he screwed? Busted in Lady's room. Peeper. With a DV cam, and assaulted police. Do me a favour please, I have finished this 154. Help me fill out the report. Need a leave this afternoon. This is too far. Please... my girl's birthday. I'll speak to the Duty Officer a little bit later. Your drink, my treat. Officer, I need take a leak. Report to him. Hey buddy, let's catch up later. OK. See you. Your wife cooked this? Yes. She's nice to you. Watch your mouth. This is Sergeant Tsim Kin Yip 4332. Taipo Division, Squad A. Taking testimony with you now. You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say will be used against you in a court of law. Understood? Yes. What's your name? Kwan Ping Man. You're missing a G there. PC 2689 found you in a woman's loo at An Po Road, Taipo. Peeping someone urinating with a digital camera. Is it true? No. I was not spying someone urinating. So what did you do? Women could go to lavatory for something else. That I know. Why did you spy with that camera? To find out if they're planning to kill men. Cunt. You don't believe me, then why bother to fucking ask? So you don't admit your crime, hey? I was collecting evidence. So you were peeping and looking for someone plans to kill. I was there seeing if someone talk about killing. I was not checking anyone planning. Don't you fool a police officer. Fuck it. Women are planning to kill men all the time. They get their ways. Cars, poisons... People die everyday. No one gets noticed. I know they have a poison. Colourless, odourless and tasteless. Not even an autopsy could find. Men drink it will belch endlessly. When he has 100 belch, he dies. Shall I record every word? Sure, it is true. So you are saying there are women, talking in the loo about plans to kill men. Not necessarily in a lavatory. They can talk anywhere. But the lady's room is more convenient since no man is around. They are tricky. When they found a man out there, they call for police. I've learned this. Then I took a camera there. Repeat. Not necessarily in a lavatory. They can talk anywhere. They are tricky. When they found someone spying, they call for police. Then I've learned this. I took a camera in there. And now... So you admit you've broken into women's loo more than once. Fuck. Why don't you believe me? Don't be fucking stupid. I am telling you the truth. Damn you cops know nothing. Wake the fuck up. Watch your tongue. Sorry I am fucking vulgar. Have you heard of a case? A van was on the way to Shum Jing last week. Suddenly hit down by a big truck. The driver died in a terrible way. I was the witness of that case. I want to save him. I was the one who called for police. Write this down, please, write this too. Officer Tsim. Thanks. Wait for a second. I wanna take a shower, quickly. OK. How's your auntie doing? She's 90 but still bloody healthy! Talks like fighting. Your uncle wanted to buy her a gold pendant. She didn't want it and trashed him for a whole night. Uncle is back? When will he leave? Let's find him and have some dinner. Not so soon. He's looking for a flat. Maybe he's not going back to Vancouver. What's happened? Is he settling down here? He's not made up his mind yet. Wants to do some business here. He used to do electric equipments trading. Now he wants to switch to surveillance trade. Then I suggest him to take up security. And Yip could help him. After all, a man should have his own business. Yip has served for so many years, must know lots of people. If he's in, it will be a great help to your uncle's business. If you want, I'll take care of you shares. Count me in. After all it's a business. While serving the force isn't. I just wanna be helpful. That'll do mom. Let us think about it. You don't have to listen to my mom. What are you talking? Are you mad at her? What? Take it easy. What are you talking? What? Hello? What's going on? Now? Alright. I gotta get back to work. Fine. What's up? Did Duty Officer know this? Not yet. I called you first. Do it properly. Report to Duty Officer first. But it's Fai's suspect. Sounds inappropriate for me. Did you call Fai? Only reached his voice mail. Should I call him again? No. Bring out the suspect. I'll take another statement with him. How could it be missing? I don't know. Just delivered it to the evidence room. Then they called me. Said it was missing. Didn't you check it? Something wrong with your statement. Now I am taking another with you. Is it clear? Yes. My name is Kwan Ping Man. 34 years old. I'm a sex maniac. So I went to a public loo this morning, peeped at some women. This isn't what you said this afternoon. Yes it is. I was peeping. That's all. What did you say this afternoon? Yes... but no... Yes... yes... Since I am filthy. I peeped at some women urinating. I've done this before. Go check it in your computer. Then I shot with my video camera. After that, I went home. And jerked off. Now I am taking another statement with you. Repeat every word exactly what you said this afternoon. No... I've just admitted that I was only being filthy. You said you wanted to collect some evidence. No, Sir. I am a sex maniac. I am sorry Sir. I don't like myself being so filthy. But it's true. I jerk off all the time. Makes me happy. Hey, Yeung. I have a suspect named Kwan Ping Man. Did anyone come to visit him today? This one. Fong Chi Tsing. Who is this? Madam Fong, head of the evidence room. Madam! Madam! Wait a second. What is it? I am from squad A. I want to know if you went to the remand room last night. Did you see suspect Kwan Ping Man? Yes I did. What's the matter? Why did you go to see him? He's a friend of my friend. I went there to see if I can help. Anything else? Nothing. Thank you. Who was that woman? A fellow cop. What do you think? She is a cop. Nothing. As you said. It's nothing. I saw you really cared. What did you say to her? Fai caught a suspect yesterday. A peeper in a women's loo, he said he found out a secret. He said some women plan to kill all men. Nutty! But he changed his words later. Said he was there just peeping. What's that to do with her? Your Madam. Before he changed his words. Madam had gone up to meet him. I was just checking her. What did she say? The suspect was a friend of her friend's. What's up? Are you familiar with her? There you go again. She is a colleague. Congratulations! Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. I need your guidance. Officer Chan. I am only meeting the promotion board. That's all you need. Officer Chan. You don't have to say anything tonight. We guys would like to buy you a drink at the bar. Tsim, don't you hide again. You gotta come! No, no. I have to go home tonight. My wife's order! - Don't be so anti-social! - Yeah. No. I haven't seen my wife for a while. She's moaning. Enjoy it. Let me share the bill. You want me hand this to the intelligence unit? Yes, Sir. So the suspect changed his words. Then what? Couldn't he have lied previously? He has a peeping record before. Now he's admitted it. That's normal. Are you suggesting that Madam Fong's involved in this? So you want me give them this, and the intelligence unit should look for this organization? That I don't know. But I think Madam Fong could be fishy. Think again. Do you really want to hand me this? I've thought again. I won't give this to them. I think its ok. - Hello. - Hello, Where are you? Honey. Why are you so late? Wait for a second. Sorry, I was just trying some wedding gowns with Angie. I should come home a bit late tonight. Food's in the fridge. Call me when you leave. I'll call you. Bye. Now what? Sir. - Why are you so frightened? - Nothing. What are you burning? I have admitted everything. What do you want? Why did you change your words? Don't ask. What did Madam Fong say to you? Why do you bother to ask? She said nothing. Go! Get lost! My husband's here. I'm not coming. - You guys take care. Bye! - Bye! You're so sweet. As always. Why does this car smell? Does it? I don't smell it. I just visited Kwan Ping Man. You what? The suspect arrested by Fai several days ago. You really don't smell it? Man murdered. A woman is arrested. Half-naked man died in mystery. Wife disappeared after killing her husband. You motherfucker! Will you stop? Why did you change your words? Can you just leave me alone? You're doing this in vain. Did someone ask you to change? No. How did you know Madam Fong? Don't you fucking ask. Are you stopping your investigation? Do you want me to get killed? Leave me alone! Go away! Testing, testing, 123... 123... 123 I started stalking Kwan Ping Man. I found out that he was working on some cases. Some accidental deaths, victims are all male. Is this what he said "women's murderer", no, "women murderers"? Is this related to his so called "syndicate of women murderers"? Hello. OK. I'll come to pick you up. Honey. The credit card centre called me, said I won a prize. A free trip to Tokyo for a couple of days. Really? How about next week? We can catch up with the cherry blossoms. Let's see. I'm busy these days. This is gonna be overdue soon. Six star hotel, flights, all free! I am busy with a case. C'mon, let's go. We haven't travelled for a long time. Let me think about it. Dry it well! When did I make up my mind to be with you? What? Do you remember? Two months after we met, That stormy night, I went to your home. Yes. - Hello? - What? I just forgot to dry my hair and fell asleep. That's awful. That will blow some wind into your head. What should I do then? Just go sleep. It's only one time. When I was small, my mom wouldn't let me sleep with my hair wet, she believed that will get wind into my head. My grandma suffered from that, she had a headache for 10 years. I believe this since you told me that night. I've never slept with my hair wet. So? I think it's important. M'am, what illness has your husband got? He's suffered from heart attack. Pain in his chest. I've planned to take him to do a body check. At dinner, he said his chest ached, and fell like that. So why do you give him such heavy oily food? Next time when you come up, call me first. I bring you dumplings. No, no, sweetie, this laminate floor could be a hell ofjob to maintain. Yeh? Yip's early today! - Mrs Tsim! - Fai! You finally come! - Come in. - Thank you Sorry I am in a hurry. Your home's all wired. Frankly, I have to charge you. My men have done theirjob. Or we can rewire your home. But you will charge me once more! Just a little communication problem. You have to pay my men, not me. Mrs Tsim. You see the bathroom's tiles? Not a single straight line. Shall I pay for that too? I've given you a discount. Please don't mix these two things up. I'm not the one who charged you. Mrs Tsim. It's your own words! That mosaic was a lousy job last time. Who can tell what is good and what is bad? I've done yourjob at zero profit. C'mon, you're putting my next client in hold. Now what? It's your idea to tear the door. It's a communication problem? Don't you dare to make us pay? Mom! Don't sign. Let me handle this. Or should we wait for Yip. He's been busy these days. What busy? He's not a businessman. What's your point? He's not young anymore. I just worry about you. I know... who the right guy is. Mom came by today. Talking about the security business again. Is the new house rewired? Check carefully before you sign it. Have you wondered that your dad's death wasn't an accident? What do you mean? Have you lost your mind? What are you talking about? If you have time, do some serious business, ok? You promised me to see the decoration together. Now I have to do that all by myself. I have to work. Me too! Do you know what colour the floor is? Why is our home rewired? Do you know the contractor came up to bargain with me today? I am working on a case. What case? Even yourself don't know what it is. If you do care about our home. Do something. Would you? I'll get the job done-A slogan of the Hong Kong Mayor What's up? Officer, what's going on? Someone missing, sounds like burglary. M'am, what's your name? Ex-wife of the missing person. Pun Siu Yuen. Hey, you know her? - Thanks. - You're welcome. Give me two weeks. You know the rule. Now he's following me. Give me some time. I can stop him. I don't understand. What do you like him? I am not here talking about private things. So there is no conversation about "our" business. Anyway leave him alone. I can stop his investigation. Leave me and my husband alone. When will you come back to help us? Need help? Did you find my husband? No. I want to ask you where he is. What do you mean? It's me who called police. We've been separated for a year. I haven't received my allowance for two months. Why were you divorced? Same old reasons. If you see him or think of anything, give me a call. It's fixed now. Is he screwed up with a crime? I am having dinner with colleagues. Fai got promoted. We celebrate for him. Sorry I forgot to tell you. Leave the food in the fridge. Save for tomorrow. What are you looking for? My own stuff. What is it? Money. Was it all in a mess this morning? Did your husband tell you anything unusual? What do you mean? About women killing all men. My husband is nuts. He talks weird all the time. Never mind him. Sir. Excuse me. Need a ride? No. Thanks. What? There's someone over there. Where? - That furthest spot. - Nobody is there. Congratulations! I was told last night. Your name is on the promotion list. Prepare for the meeting. Madam! That suspect in the loo, did you say he was a friend of your friend's. Yes. So? He is missing. His flat's been burgled too. Any way we can find him? Well I am not that familiar with that friend in fact. Anyway it's not a big deal. Lots of criminals are like that. They sink and vanish before going to the court and float up to reappear later. Are you still working on this case? No. Just curiosity. Keep your curiosity to yourself. Get ready for the board. What you did has blocked your way to promotion. I feel sorry for you. Sometimes we shall only mind our own business. Don't try... to be a hero. Now you are way up to meet the board. Why choose a dead end? You've been here for 20 years. Grow up! Concentrate on your own job. Don't forget... who you are. Pun Siu Yuen, Kwan Ping Man's ex-wife. I've been following her these days. She said she didn't know where her husband was. Neither the syndicate of women murderers. But I got an intuition that I will get something out of this woman. Hello... Try to relax... stretch this leg. Ann got hurt in the class. You'd better take her to see the doctor. Yes of course. Sure. Thanks. Take care. What did you do this time? Where is my passport? I didn't find it. House's been burgled. Cops' have been here too. - Is he called Tsim? - Yes. So you gave me out? You think I'm moron? Of course I didn't. You're in debt again. Aren't you? No. No? Then why did someone burgle your house? I told you someone wants to kill me. Who? Kill you for what? Some women! You peeped at them so they want to kill you? Are you taking me as an idiot? That's all? You only got this? Why don't you admit you've got a mistress? You fucking bitch. I've told you everything. You just don't trust me. How can I trust you? You and all your crap! How can I run away without a passport? Turn yourself in. I can't go anywhere without a passport. Fuck! Come, take it! I am going to the board next week. Good for you! Hello? Not at all. Go on. Am I disturbing you? No. I am fine. Are you? Do you think that my husband is in trouble? Why ask? What do you know? Nothing. I just worry about him. What are you doing? I just got home. That's fine. I'll call again if I had to. Bye. He came by last night. I wanted to tell you last night. If you found him, he might not have died. That TV broke down. He bought me a new one right away. He brought me shoes in Shen Zhen. But I messed up... his favourite shirt. What a loser am I! I really love him... I did... I've had an abortion. I didn't want this baby myself. But I blamed him. I trashed him all day long. When he coughed at night, I blamed him for being noisy. Why did things turn like this? We used to love each other. Why did we end up like this? I've tried my best. Don't you know that? I came to Hong Kong alone. My clients, they made me drink. I am used to it. They are assholes! You know, hanky panky. I hate this place! No lift. The lights break down often. I damn hate this! Do you know when I sleep... I wake up... I hate myself! Do I look cheap? Come, fuck me. Fuck me! Problems of a new flat are endless. She wants a small one. Not my idea. I want a bigger service apartment. More comfy. Keep her mom shut up. How can we have kids? She used to be happier. I used to think Hong Kong is a paradise. It's clean. The men are gentle. Then he lost his job. We started quarrelling all the time. Then we only remember those quarrels. Whatever. What? What are you doing? Why giggle? Stop it. Stop it! You fool. Ouch! - Are you ok? - No. My leg! Convulsion? Stay calm. Relax. Are you ok? Enjoy it. Another one with sweet source! Got it. Done? Give it to me. Right away sir! No... I am her husband. We were told several days ago that we won a prize. Two free tickets to Tokyo. When shall we receive them? Are you sure? Maybe it's a mistake. Thank you. Let's go. It's nothing actually. Maybe your wife wants a trip. But fears that you might blame her for spending money. Never mind it's true or not. Just go, have fun with her! But most men don't like to travel. Don't worry about me. I won't ask you to divorce. I am not that kind of woman. Your wife is right. Mind your own business. Even if it's true. Women do plan to kill men. If they kill all men, how long will it take? Forever? Stop investigating. I want you in one piece. Honey... You used to have so many dolls in your car. But you don't have a single one in our home. I bought you one when I just saw it. Don't you like it? Yes... Is our new home ready? Why don't we go to Tokyo next week? How's your leg? Can you put down your work? Sure. Before the board interview, let's go travel, have some fun. How's everything going? My husband has quit it. Leave him alone. I know. He's been busy with the other woman. Whatever you say. Anyway, I won't tell anyone what we've done before. And I won't do such thing again. Not all men are jerks. I am happy now. I hope this is our last meeting. When I was young, I was assigned to Wanchai Station. One night on duty, I saw a bunch of naked frogmen, Breaking in and beating a suspect up. Then a senior told me, all cops did that when they beat someone up. Even the suspect complained, That a bunch of naked frogmen abused him in the station at midnight. The judge wouldn't believe him. I think they were wrong. Then I reported this to my supervisor. It turned out that I was isolated. They did me a bad appraisal. Even I passed my written exam, I still didn't get promoted. I've learned my lesson after that. Once something appears to be so bizarre, then no one believes it's true. But it doesn't mean that it's untrue. Hello, it's me. What you told me last time. I know it. Let's have a drink some day. Bye. What's going on here? Arrest him. He's beating women. Calm down. Hey, you! Don't fool around! Nothing happened. It's only quarrelling. Don't arrest him. You ungrateful child! Some one called the police. We officer will handle this. You brat! Are you the house owner? Sir, this ungrateful child... I'm so unhappy. Don't you know that I want to kill myself? Actually we've applied for a place in Harmony House for you. But do you really want to separate with your mom? You gotta fight for happiness. Suicide is not a solution. You are unhappy because... Your life doesn't change. It's still the same. You chose to escape. Why don't you try to change the world? In fact all the hatred of this world are caused by men. Have you ever wondered what the world will be if there is no man left? Buy another one? Let your boyfriend buy it. Every time I kill a man, I buy one. Shut the engine, pull the handle, ID card and licence please. Sir, what's going on? Don't you realize... You didn't light on before turning on the highway, blocking all the cars behind. I am sorry. I didn't see a line behind me. With so many dolls' blocking, naturally you didn't see. ID card. Where are you going? To meet my friend, shopping. What? Shopping. Where? Good morning Sir! Sergeant Tsim Kin Yip reporting to the promotion board. Sit down please. Thank you Sir! Sergeant 4332, introduce yourself first. Yes Sir! My name is Tsim Kin Yip. Sergeant 4332. Graduated in 1984.
