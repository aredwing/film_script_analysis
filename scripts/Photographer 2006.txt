It means 1/125 pan of a second. You can imagine, how fast the shutter opens up and closes. Just like winking your eye lids! In different occasions how much the shutter should open up! Whether it has to be half open or full opened. The aperture is for that. If there is powerful light, the shutter is to be opened a little. When the light is very dim change it to 3.5.

I know it! What do you know? ...that I am mad? Nandu was taken away by the police and killed him. If I say that, they will say that I am mad. Mom! I was saying that I know all about Nandu. That boy is not seen any where. Sir, please sit. They are looking for him. Will you sit down? These are usual things here. Many have escaped from here. When they are caught by the police they will be brought back to here. If they are caught in this jurisdiction. Or else, they will be caught up some where else. This establishment has only that obligation! Will it be a problem, madam? He is not in the register, why do we worry then? GREEN REVOLUTION Has every body come? -Yes sir. Please take your seat.

Like fishing in the troubled waters... "tears filled up her eyes! Her hair were flowing down. She held Asokan's hands and cried. Asokettan lf the society don't allow us to live.. ...breaking the barriers of religion.. ...we will elope away to some place! Shall I read the rest? -You can read after a while. His writing is good! ls not it? It is mom, who makes me drink like this. Josechayan has undergone his police training" ...and I am a novelist. My head is tender! Mom has to understand it. What was in the head office? You have gone for about 3 days. What is this mom? How long will it prolong? Are you not fed up? If mom call you up he will come here. You alone have to call him up! Mom thinks that it is Dijo's story that he is writing! Mom will come to know that it is she who is making this cruel deed by Dijo! I will go to the Kottayam head office and stay there for 5 days.

He will not come if I call him. Don't take it for granted. He has confronted dad and got away as an act of boldness! When he wants to see me he will come to me. What shall I do now? Government need not have to show these files to you. Government's announcement that it will offer the land to the tribes was official That was not all. They grabbed the forest land and built up huts! They set check posts in the forest and "stopped forest officials and the police from getting in. Can the government allow that? It was them who offered arrack to the policemen on duty there. When the tribes hacked a policeman a few of them were annoyed. These are not things that concern to me. I have suspended the Cl on the basis of your photograph. I have dismissed him. What shall I do then as the CM? I shall take up the responsibility on me and resign. It is not the CM it is to be decided at the top. You mean God who is at the top? Anandan's death was a sheer accident as you say. Then,where is Thami? Some body is watching us! Let us go to the room! Dijo!We don't need it. You need not take up an enquiry on your own. We have nobody to take care of us! We have nobody for us! I am not your enemy or a police. We don't know that. None of us have not gone there from here In 18th century, British empire built up.. "The forest law. God created the tribes as the children of the jungle! The British made them to work in the estates. The forest laws, which they have to abide... ...are to be changed. So you do not know about Thami, Neeli, or their dad Mani! They have not lived with you. If you can drop her at the school I could go straight in my way! You can go, I will do that. If you go this way it is only 10 minutes walk for you. You will become very active then! Who is this? Dijo is gone for 3 days! Don't know, where he has gone! I have no news from him! A) {Mwmwm What is it mom? With sufferings vast as the sea and.. ...consolation vast as the land. I hear, your soft spoken lisp! Showing your tiny teeth ...you put up a smile. You walked with your tiny legs! - To keep you asleep, I didn't sleep whole night In order to feed you... ...I couldn't sleep during the day My mind ,is like an oyster ...and you are a pear! in it. In the nights during prayer, with the angels With tears in my eyes.. I 5999911 for you. - Flowers blossomed in your dream... ...those springs! Angels accompanied you in your way! Always, you are followed... ...by love and affections To hear that voice ... ...the nightingale have waited. For you, the waves of light, Offered the light. - Here, a kind of search was done. Now, we must see in Vynad. If police have caught him, that can't happen without Cl's knowledge. Which CI? That one suspended. I doubt if he might be dismissed. Lives near power house. Vacated the quarters. One of you come with me, to show the house. That we will do. If you question in the right way, everything will be told. Ok. What is it? A photographer called Dijo John is not seen since 3, 4 days. They say, that sir knows about his whereabouts! Who are you? What do you think, when you see me? Get lost. Then, Sir know, where Dijo is? I should know that. Else you can't go from here.- Are you kidding? I also want to say the same. It is Kottayam team. That too, a tough one. Can't you see the fire in eyes? It will be immense. It will engulf all. I don't think, it is needed for you. If the eyes and nose are lost, you won't get them back. Threatening? Not at all. Be slow. Narayan!Narayan! (chanting Lord) Joe hasn't come? He came and left immediately. Where he went? -Don't know. He didn't say anything. Alas! Leave the boy there and sleep for some time. For anything, Let it dawn! Entered Thodakki forest and searched for tribes. That is also an emergency situation. Naturally, we doubt. You know, he was having a camera with him. That is a different camera. It's a camera, hidden in the cap. Phone to Sir. From minister! I called up in the morning and asked him that's why. Release them. What about minister? Is he a family friend? He called us and said to release that Dijo. He is Dijo's friend. Studied together in law college. These are twins, isn't it? For both, horoscopes matched well, with police. Kottayam team! Great! He is not from state police. But, from special investigation team. When minister called and said to release you, there was a commotion. The tribal problem is on his hands. Then, where I can search? You for the time being,go to our house, taking Sathya and the boy. To there, without Dijo, will she come? Didn't you get any information? Searching. Minister is taking special interest. Nothing to worry. Come, child. If he is in the custody of Central Intelligence, nothing to fear. He didn't do anything wrong, isn't it? Has he gone behind a deer or a peacock with the camera? He was of that kind! We have to think that way. -That is ok. For time being, till he comes, you go to mom. You get ready by dawn. Here, I will stay. I have to check with some friends. Uncle will bring father, soon. -Let us go to our house. Your mom said, she want to see you and this child, directly. What ever anger is there, all will be gone. I know. My child only, she is. - Why do Lord Krishna looks black? - Why Krishna looks so black in color? Is it that he has taken a bath in Kalindi river? Or that he has kitted Kaftan the serpent king? Oh brunette Radha, say it. Is it because you kissed him? - Radha then offered a reply! When Govardhan hillock was taken in his hand... ...black cloud have hugged him. - 16000 lover girls...16000 lover girls... "might have fondled him with love! - Guruvayoor Kannan replied that... ...when Kurooramma put him in the pot once.. "the affection of black shade, smudged on his body. - He said he said he has really wonderful color, even then! - When the agitation started the tribes were not aware of the seriousness. With the police, who were firing at them. Then, there is a national solidarity, it seems. All will try to take the advantage. That is the problem of their stand point. Politicians were involved to that much only But, there is no master plan for the people. In Kerala politics, what you said is correct. But, that is not politics. Dijo is having an interest in the tribal anthropology, and... ...empathy for them since he was studying in law college. He was a photographer since then. When the agitation was done, he said his opinion. Tribes will support his findings too! If it is about Dijo's missing, he could be missed any way. You mean to say that Dijo is behind this agitation? His opinions will be respected by them. As Jose says, if the Central Intelligence caught, they won't leave him. Won't be allowed to release. He is the real National. No, if we file a habeas corpus, then he will be produced in the court The records show that forest officials questioned and released. Got the order. Order has come, you can go. Then about me, all the enquiry over? Who am I? Go home, all might be worried! Go and see your son. You will be alright then. You enquired in all directions. Dijo John is a photographer and not a terrorist. Finding this, you release me. I am searching him. But, so far, didn't find anyone responsible. Dijo John is a photographer, but not a criminal. That is clear on the records. Thami, Neeli, nobody is on their records. When enquired, nobody knows, even about their births. Really, who is there for them? For one photo, he was afraid to sit here. He said you will be angry if he comes to you, unclean. How he is unclean? Ok, who are you? If the light becomes less, then you should use B shutter. For how long? As per the photographer's imagination. ...we can open up the magic window of light. I am watch man sir. They have gone. Ok. Sir, that investigation team had returned. Its raining, and if delayed there will be land slide and other problems. They put Dijo in custody in Forest guest house. If sir say you don't know, we are from Kottayam and we don't believe it. Joe, this is not the thing, you think of. Sir, we don't have time to hear all this account. One with a good status in Kerala, is missing. Records say he is in the police custody. It is the duty of Kerala government to find and return him. If you don't take that responsibility, then you resign. Come, Jose. Don't think that it is just a talk. We have an establishment to topple an assembly. That's enough. Joe, what is this? Come, quietly. If I resign... ...every one's problems will be solved. If the assembly is resigned, what is the use? We want the return of Dijo. That's what, I also say. Not that. Photos taken by Dijo are there! Then, to take a decision, what else we need? Taking today and tomorrow, for how many days? If I go home, I couldn't see that boy' s face! Curiacose, Dijo, will come? In Kerala, the rains are continued on today also. As per the government, due to rains; 13 people died. In Vynad and ldukki nine people died. In Kozikode, due to sea erosion, 4 people died. As per the government, in total its more than 65 are injured. In Vynad, in a fishing accident, 5 of a family were washed away. Govindan of I will take the child. - ...he died The children of Govindan, Rakesh and Reji were found dead. Other people, due to the unfavorable conditions, search was stopped. In Tekupad of ldukki district... Eat something. -I am not hungry. Once it is clear, you all go and search. Mom, we searched every where. Then, you need not go for him. He will come himself. To her, how many times I told? Can phone and inform. Can come by taking the next vehicle. It could have been avoided! Mom, come. If I called him,he would not have gone. All my children are saying that. Please tell him that Mom is waiting for them. Holy mom, you must let them know. To Abraham and Moses and... ...to pray to the Father; regarding my son... ...you must tell to your son, mom. Today it will not rain again. It take some days to find a route out of this forest. While searching for the way, let me go and enjoy the forest. I am Dijo John, a photographer. I lost my self in this jungle for some reasons. If you don't have any enmity for non hindus, I will capture some photos. Thank you, Lord Ganesh! Who are you? I am a human, lost way in the forest. You have a camera! -I am a photographer! I am a man who is a photographer. Are you mad? I don't know. Sathya, see who is arriving? Grandma, have you come with them? When called to our house, Sathya didn't come.. That's why I also accompanied her. What else to do? Here, what? I couldn't believe. Couldn't sit or stand. Couldn't sleep. Its just a feeling of discomfort. How can I go, without handing over your wife and son? Ok, where did you go? I went to see the god, grandma. To see god? Did you see? -Yes. -How? What? What did the god say? He said, that he likes us much. He wanted to say his regards to grandma. Why does he want to convey his regards to me alone? God likes more, the aged people! Isn't it dad? I can't believe this one. Oh Lord! Wake him up. Which is a dream? Which is real? We have almost reached. Am I awake then? Hey, Thami. The aged are liked by the angles, isn't it?-Yes. Mom, Sathya, her son and he also came. Standing out side. Mom, call them. Ask them to come in, mom. Come. Come child! Which is a dream and which is real? This is a confusing situation, dear Jose! I had a dream that l came back to the house. Then, grandma was waiting for me, at the door. When I woke up, before me, is him, like an other dream! Thammi. Forget all that and sleep well. Everything will be alright. Now, can I have a sound sleep? While I was crossing, in a lorry, that rock in the forest; That... Dijo, don't think of unnecessary things and get confused. If all this is a dream, then let me dream for ever. You are always my dream. If, this, you think as an illusion This is 125, the most common shutter speed Aperture level. Now on one side, there will be a green light. -Yes. That means, the camera is ready for taking a picture. To the trinity, Father, Son and the holy ghost..." To say thanks, this lamb is offered. Take and give something to eat and drink. If you have to say anything to the Sanctum, say it. There isn't much time. The butcher is already coming on cycle. -Now, hold. Hey, you took photo! Come. Give me the camera. -Don't give. Give it to the Aunt. I say, don't run. Give it. It's a rented house, with dust and cobweb! There is no need to close it. If you close and give the lock then it will be alright. Jose also come. I will also come. To where? For you,it doesn't matter where it is. We will get the child admitted in the school, where Asha teaches. Shouldn't we? In this, what is there to think about? That is the best school! Children of rich people study there. Even then, we have to check with teachers and masters. There are good teachers, who take risk to make children study. Isnt it brother, Jose. Will he take rice water? Who knows? Give and see. He may drink. Will drink. Now, he is in family. To mom, it is Asha who reads out PAIN OF SOUL NOVEL OF Joe! I will cry off when I hear her reading that novel. You! When I hear the story, I will think of you! Dear mom! Dijo, -What? - Please come. -What happened? Where is charan? -I sent him for a bath. What is it? -Thammi is crying there. Why do you cry? Come with me inside. Come. I want to go. Come. He wants to return home. Why is he been returned to the forest? He can stay here. Son will have a company. Who will come in search now? Mom, now, nobody will come in search. All searching have stopped. Do mom know? For the daily bread... ...As god says, living a life without any effort .. ...like mild animals are these, Thammi and his people. Just like the flowers and trees in the forest, they are like themselves. As I love you mom, they love the forest. When I was taking that photo, he said that god will be angry. The death of his father and Neeli's disappearance... Its all because I took that photo, he believes. Mom,do you have real belief in god? Dijo, I made food ready, come. To send off Thammi, I, also, will come. We will go together I got it. That sleep, I never slept like that. No sounds and no dreams. I also ceased. Then I got up. What I heard later were, horrible sounds. Like the sound of thunder in the inner ear! Then I heard the sound of rain. When I woke up it was darkness. It was heavy rain and thunder! There was land slide also. Dijo might have heard that sound in sleep. I did not think of anything else! I needed only the light. I prayed for light and waited. Let us go. Come. Wait c)Ops! Do not push me! -Come. Come Thami, shoot! I will shoot a picture. -Yes. Is the green light on? I want only the photograph.
