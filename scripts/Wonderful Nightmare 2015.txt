In my faint memory, I remember his white uniform and his warm touch. He never came back from the sea, and he was wiped out of my memory. Sweetie, I'm so sorry! I don't believe it! Longing for dad, mom, too, departed thereafter. I became all alone. Love is... No, to women, men do more harm than good. I must rely on myself. I'll succeed without relying on anyone. DIRECTED BY KANG HYO-JIN WONDERFUL NIGHTMARE Recent sexual assault case is gaining traction on social media. The suspect is rumored to be son of CEO of a major corporation, and public is arguing over validity of this case. - Youth protection... - Turn it off. Those sons of bitches should all be castrated. BILL OF INDICTMENT Those sons of bitches should all be castrated. What's the prosecutor doing? Justice has failed, completely. CHAIRMAN PARK HK CONSTRUCTION Chairman, this is LEE Yeon-woo. Me? I understand. I'll take care of it. Yes, sir. Turn it around, prosecutor's office. It's attorney LEE Yeon-woo! Ms. LEE! Have you taken over HK Construction's case? Have you met the victim? Let me be clear. This is unrelated to HK Construction, and it has yet to be labelled as a 'case'. Can you confirm that you'll be defending chairman PARK's son? Can you verify that it was an attempted assault? Will this affect HK's succession plan? Nothing has been concluded. Refrain from writing anything based on conjecture. - That is all. - Please clarify! What's HK's position? Ma'am, I can only imagine what you're going through. I don't need anything. I'll do whatever it takes to lock up that bastard! Yes, he deserves it. But HK is one of the top 10 corporations in the country. When he's transferred to a foreign office for a while, no one will remember this case. But what about your daughter? She has to attend school, then find a job in Korea, and get married here as well. But when this case blows up, and her identity is revealed online, what'd happen then? In all honesty, it wasn't even rape. You got no family, no daughter, right?! Do you know how I feel?! Settle?! No way in hell! Mom! Just a moment. She's right. Let's stop this. We'll settle. But not for a chump change. She's smart. Let's iron out the details. Expensive suits are different! You're one of a kind! LEE Yeon-woo! Been a while. I wondered if you'd take the case. Judging from your face, you got what you wanted. I'm a little busy, I'll see you later. Without a supporter like HK, would you still be like this? No, what for? You get tax payer's money, but I get retainers. It's the logic of capitalism. That sharp mind hasn't changed one bit. That girl even attempted suicide. So are you, that emotional mind of yours. Rationality and emotion are what separates the rich from the poor. You still don't get it. How was the blind date? I heard he was young and hot. I didn't go, I hate young 'uns. Not again?! You're already 39! Let's talk about something more fun. What's more fun than talking about men? Dating and marrying your lover is the best. Men are completely useless. You're going overboard with that logic. Ms. LEE. It's HK's chairman PARK. Welcome. Thank you for cleaning up after my idiot son. No, it's just work. Thank you for pushing my transfer to US branch. Not at all. Quid pro quo. These shanties still exist? It looks shabby now, but that'll change soon. I plan to build a nice apartment complex. So I wanted to personally ask you for a favor. Please speak your mind. We're breaking ground in 5 years, I'd like to push that up. Can it be done sooner? You know me, it's not a problem. My US transfer came through. I told you about it. I'll never live a petty life like you did. Why aren't there any lights here? My glasses... Excuse me, why am I here? What is this? May I get your name? I'm LEE Yeon-woo. Date of birth? October 23, 1976. One moment please. Does this make one damn sense?! How could you not notice until clients are in heaven?! I double checked... Ms. KANG Su-yoon had another full month left! Is this China? We're processing 50 million, not 1.3 billion! Chief! What? Another soul was processed prematurely. What? Mistaken identity with LEE Yeon-woo, b. 1941. Input error, most likely. Good job. Excellent job, asshole! Dammit! It's a miracle! Her pulse is back! So she's alive? 1976 LEE's process date is 2054. So... a woman who's due in a month, bypassed our relay station to heaven, and another who's due in 2054, came here instead of a granny. What the hell have you been doing?! Jesus... How long to swap souls? To cancel 1976 LEE's registration, and put 1941 LEE in place would take at least a week. And what about KANG in heaven? That's the bigger problem. She's supposed to be in a car accident, but had a heart attack. She just needs to be alive for a month, right? Please sit. This is an afterlife relay center. In other words, we relay deceased people before sending them up to heaven. Deceased? Who? Me? I don't believe you. Why should I? Why should I die at my age? Can't you see that I'm alive?! It was an accident, a simple accident! - Ms. LEE. - It can't be! Do you know how sturdy that car is?! Ms. LEE! Then let me go, let me live, please! Can't you? Please! Calm down and sit please. Calm down. I agree that your bitter end was untimely. May I make a suggestion? There's a special program for those who feel wronged. They can be sent back to the living. Am I eligible? Oh, thank you! But in order for that to happen, you'll have to give us a hand. What must I do for you? Live a month in someone else's shoes. There's someone who's here too early. You must take her place... for her final month. In other words, live out another person's final month? That's it! Once you finish that and come back here, we'll send you back, like this never happened. But I... look different and everything else. We'll take care of that. But you cannot reject her life, act out in any way, or interfere with your previous life. What say you? We could help each other out, or you could go to heaven now. Okay, I'll do it. I will. Please step in this ring. Put your hand on the screen. See you in a month. Am I back? What's going on? What is it? What happened? Pol... police! Police! Was it that undies thief? Move aside. Where are you?! There's no one, maybe you were mistaken. - You! - Me? I'm the undies thief? You're the only undies thief I know. That's mine, right? You're wearing it. See? That's my pair. So which film are you mimicking today? Stay back! Go away! I'll hit you with this! I will! I'm late for work. Wait. What was that movie? I know this! Scream! It's Scream! With Drew Barrymore, right?! 'Hello, Sidney, ' you're doing Scream? Right? Right? No? Never mind then. It can't be. I'm only having this for breakfast. I made myself clear. No proper meals until I get acting classes. Who are you? That's how you wanna play? Then who are you? Why are you here? Indeed... Why am I... here? Mom. Mom! - Stay back! - Mom! Stay back! $10. - $10? - Hurry, I'm late! Come on! Now! Now! I'm off! I'm late, give me breakfast! Come on! Let's eat! - Dad! - Son, sleep well? Let's eat. What're you doing? Let's eat. Breakfast? Huh? Didn't cook? Excuse me? Do I really look like your wife? Which ghost movie is that from? Would I confuse my wife with a random woman? I'm late, I have to go. You eat that. I'll grab something on the way. Fix him something. I'm off! And the kids won't get enough energy from these. Cook him some rice. I'm off! Make him rice! Mom! Dad ate everything! Cook me something! Who are you all, and why nag me for food?! Why wasn't I warned about this?! Wife of a stranger, and a mother of two?! Mom! This is yours. Mine? Born 1981? So, I'm 34? Let's go, I'm late for pre-school! Hold on, wait! Good morning! Hi there! Good morning, Mrs. KIM. Thank you for ginseng the other day. I did what? Pardon? Haneul's mom! Is your name Haneul? That's my sister, I'm Haru. Still can't remember her name? So, that shrew is Haneul. My elevator ads were torn down recently, was it your kids? Someone saw yesterday. Those cost money! You can't rip them up! Excuse me, are we close? What? Your tone suggests that we're close. You're odd today. Shall we settle this for good today? I'm gonna miss the bus! Don't push, hold on! Who the heck's that fat ass? Did she get up on the wrong side of bed? - I'm gonna miss it! - Okay, take it easy! Haru, Haru! Did you sleep in this morning? Yeon-woo, Yeon-woo. Radish kimchi just arrived, wanna try it? Don't, I got some last night, it's inedible. - What did you say? - It's delicious! Thanks! Here's the bus, look! - Morning! - Hello! - Take care of Mina! - Good bye! Have a good day! Where you off to? Got an urgent matter... No way! We're supposed to pick up stuff for our side job. - Let's go! - Go! Go! - Take care! - Thank you! We'll fold 'em in no time, so save more for us! If you can meet the deadline, there's always more. Good, thank you! - Thank you! - Good bye! He speaks Korean well for a filipino. - And cute too. - Look here. Thanks to me, we get 35 cents per. Fat chance, had it been others. Right, right. 10,000 there, which comes to $350. A month of food expense. Thank you so much! Wait, excuse me. But why must I fold these? Eh? Eh? You were the one begged for a side job hook up. Idiot! What an idiot! - I did? - You did. If you'll excuse me, I got urgent matter... Why're you so desperate to leave us? Can't let you leave. With a paycheck lined up, let's grab a hard drink! - Let's go! - But it's too early for liquor... - It's really good! - Only 3 days expired. Just 3 days?! We're not gonna die. - It's okay. - Chew when you eat! It's fine. I should be on a diet! You got a big one! What happened on The Eldest Princess? Yeah, I didn't get to see it. - The Eldest Princess? - Yeah, tell us. Who's that? Don't kid! You're the goddess of soap opera. I don't like soap operas. Only those who got nothing to do watch them. Is she acting? - Give her an award! - So good! What's wrong? Getting hitched at 18, your only joy in life is watching TV and movies and acting it out. Hitched at 18? Me? Your panties slid off early. I'm 39 now, no, I'm 34, so... so at what age did I give birth?! It's your kid, how should I know? She's weird today! Washroom... - There! There! - Yeon-woo! What's with her? Could she be pregnant again? So they did it recently? Are you feeling better? What is it? Are you trying to look fake? I'm not just trying to, I am one, a real fake! Don't you want your life back? If you keep this up, you'll only create confusion. But I suddenly became a wife, and a mother of 2! Have you seen those women? I don't fit in, they're so tacky and loud! Ms. LEE! If you continue, I must send you back up. Remember, without hardship, there is no life. But this isn't my life! It is now. For a month. FREEZER: 2 BAGS OF PAPRIKA... MOM'S SPECIAL ORDER! DON'T DRINK OUT OF BOTTLE! Is this a garden? What's this? Am I a zebra? Nothing to wear... So she got married to this man at 18, birthed 2 kids, and gave up all rights as a woman, and lived in this dump. Right? Okay, I understand. At least I'm 5 years younger. But I can't go on like this. Got my own way of doing things. $497.50 Can you deliver? The address is... Exceeded credit limit. What? What's with her? Ma'am, can you hurry up?! Hello? Woman, the school bus' arriving. Tada! I got strawberry milk! You idiot! You're really weird today, get your act together! I'm sorry. Good thing I was there for Haru. I bought him a strawberry milk. Ji-woo, let's go. Always share. Don't look at me like that, I'm dying inside too. I see you often today. Indeed. Aren't you buying salted anchovies? It's really good, my mother made it herself. I hate anchovies. I think not, probably can't afford it. Say what? Look here! 'Brada'? Not 'Prada'? Who wears knockoffs nowadays? Haneul, don't be mad. - I won't mention your poop again. - You're doing it again! I really won't, I swear as a man! I will never talk about Haneul's poop episode, ever! Seriously! So annoying! Wait, wait. Do you smell that too? If you're all here, please sit. What's with the tone? Since the morning. You there, sit down. You too, mister. 'Mister'? Wait... What movie is this? From her expression, some cyborg movie. Did this cow work out? It's so muscular! Sweetie, chew it properly. Got any steamed rice? Eat the potato please. What's with extra courtesy? Didn't cook rice again? I didn't. This meat is too tough. Put it in the fridge, I'll eat it later if I get hungry. Wait. Sit down, I got an announcement. Since I've done so much for you all, I need a vacation. So I'll be taking one for a month. Vacation? Where? Maybe my parents home, destination is of no importance. So random! Dad and I can take care of ourselves, what about the brat? Gotta take him to pre-school, and feed him too. I could drop him off in the morning. And meals? I gotta feed him?! Am I a teenage mother?! If it's too much, we can hire a maid. And where do we get that money? We can't even afford my acting class, but hire a maid for your vacation? - So annoying. - Haneul, sit. Haneul, sit! Sweetie! And why're you acting so strange lately? Your parents passed away, their home don't exist. They did? Is that so? Never mind. You must be tired, let's get ready for bed. So I'm an orphan again. Climb in. I'm fine here, we need to talk. Oh yeah. Public project selection gala is next Thursday. What is that? I told you, a gala for district office people. You work at district office? Come on! Yes, I work there. What's with these questions? What did you want to say? Why did I exceed credit limit? What do you mean? You wanted to use cash only, so you lowered the limit to $500. I did? Kids asleep? Probably? Wait! - Stop! - What? - Mister. - What? Why are you taking your pants off? Aren't the kids asleep? Probably not? You said so yourself. Probably not! Don't scream! You'll wake them up! Stop kidding around. What's with you! Wait! Wait! What was that for?! It's our 'dirty day'! Dirty' what? Being all shy after having 2 kids? Since you brought it up, how could you knock up an innocent 18-year old?! What? Protection of Minor Against Sexual Crimes Act 7, Statutory Rape of Underage Minor Act 1, life imprisonment for those who threaten for sex, or minimum of 5 years, did you not know that?! You're scaring me. You're shameless, you seduced a teen and impregnated me twice, was this shabby apartment part of your grand plan? I hate irresponsible men like you the worst! Also, did your beautiful face made you a civil servant?! I hate men who look like pimp daddy! Are you being honest? You don't even like how I look? Pimp daddy... And I came to tell you that we should sleep separately. Out of the way. Give me a pillow. Pillow! Wait! Pimp daddy... Is she mad at me? What's with her? There's a reason for a woman's mood swing. Come on! Saving pennies for a Porsche? By not buying this, I can get brand-name crayons. Give her divorce papers, you'll get your answers. Divorce papers? If she just takes it, she's got a man. My ex did that. Here, take this. Chief! Please take a look. What is it? I mentioned this earlier. NOISE BARRIER PLAN This again? Subway noise barrier? The residents are up in arms. I got no leverage against big developers. But there're over 2,000 households. Yeah, it's only 2,000 households. So as planned, focus on side walk renewal project. But sir... Instead of wasting budget, why not a realistic project... Enough! Do that when you become the chief. Until then, just do what I tell you. - It's so big! - Look delicious! Smells good too! Try some, it's now or never. - Go on. - Try it. - Thank you! - So good! Yeon-woo, did you go to the clinic? Oh yeah. Clinic? You know, your third child. What are you talking about?! Your marriage is the talk of town. Good to do it regularly. I thought marriage'd be Fifty Shades of Grey but it's more like Twilight. - I'm a nun. - We're siblings. - Loyalty is all we got. - The best kind. - Oh yeah, petitions. - Right. - Apartments 2 and 5. - Got it. Here, 6. You didn't sign this, here. What is it? Neighbor zone is up for redevelopment. We're in the same district, so we gotta submit these. Petitioning against pushing up redev start date? We're breaking ground in 5 years, I'd like to push that up. My passcode wasn't changed. This is my home, but why am I so nervous? Paperwork... Okay. This is Haneul's mom? So plain. Oh yeah! Game over. How'd you like to pay? Single payment. The total comes to $3,100. Not a lot of new products. Ma'am, your signature please? LEE YEON-WOO If you eat it with bread, it's so good. Sorry. You're KIM Haneul, right? Yes. We should be friends. Of course. Okay, have a good one. Who is it? I saw her the other day, she was cute. It's okay, moms are like that. Really? Your mom too? My mom had it, but she's all better now. Take your mom to the hospital. What is she sick of? It's called menopause, all moms get it. Menopause? Hey kiddo. Here alone? Can I get menopause pills? What? My mom has it, I need some pills. Wait here. Here you go. Keep this a secret. Just say 'have vitamins, ' okay? Okay. Eating like this is bare minimum. Holy cow! What? Have vitamins. It's for me? I don't like sour stuff. Hurry. - Now? - Yeah. So sour! I dislike the boy the least. We need to talk. Now! Go on then. I got dinner to prepare. Please sit. I prefer to stand. I've been thinking about our talk all day. - But honey... - Wait! Could you call me by my name please? - Your name? - Yes. I got a fine name, I never liked pet names. Okay, hone... LEE Yeon-woo. I admit that it wasn't easy marrying me as a teenager. But you're... the one who hitted on me! You chased after me like a horndog! You were all over me because I looked like that model! Molesting a minor? Wait, give me a minute. And we started dating after your graduation! So why the naivete? Is that all? And I'm not an irresponsible man. I'm trying so hard to keep my family happy. Okay, fine! If you really hate living like this, I won't hold you back! Here, here! Dammit... DECLARATION OF DIVORCE You'll be a widower soon. So I hitted on him, it was me. Not cool. So hungry, give me food. Don't you even greet an adult? Don't nag me, are you PMSing? What?! Honey! What is this? - What's all this? - You bought clothes? Look at the price tag! $2,150 for a coat?! And this suit is over $900, explain yourself! Are you nuts?! I bought it with my money. It's not like you helped pay for it! Did you just say "my money"? One must lead a sensible life. We can't live this way. Sensible? Let's talk later. Who is it? Is Mrs. LEE Yeon-woo here? Yes, she's my wife. May I help you? Listen, my friend lend it to me! Ms. KANG is in a coma after an accident. Just fess up. Where did you steal it? Dammit! What do you mean steal?! An old crusty woman like her, can't be mistaken for the most respected lawyer in town. An old... crusty woman? This is character defamation! Honey, get up. - Let's go home. - What? You're going nowhere! Sit back down. Listen. We're here to help the case, not to be accused. 'Officer Code of Duty Act 3, clause 2, 'when a questioning becomes part of an investigation, 'the defendant must voluntarily cooperate for it to be objective.' We voluntarily accompanied you to the station, and due to your shortcoming, the questioning is over, so we will voluntarily head home. Do you object? - No, sir. - Right? And I... went to school with... - Ms. KANG. - What? I'm Seoul U, Law School class of '99. PROOF OF EDUCATION He dropped out... after 2 years. We had dinner because we're very close, and she must've slipped her the card after hearing about our troubles. Go on, tell them. He's right. Now, your apologies please. What? Apology? For calling my wife an old crusty woman. You did her wrong, so it's only fair. Own up to it. I'm sorry, madame. We were mistaken. Okay, be careful from now on. You may leave. Didn't know he was my junior... Why did give up law school to be a petty civil servant? I can't believe I'm reduced to this. Holy cow! Why did you do it? It's not what it looks! It's a misunderstanding! And... I'm not the type who does this, but... do you... have another man? Man? Really? What do you take me for! Good enough for me. Because I trust you. What just... happened? I'm truly amazed. Holy cow! In just 44 hours, 14 minutes and 28 seconds since rebirth, you received divorce papers, stole a credit card and ended up in the police station. The thing is... If your goal was to tip the balance of this world, then congrats. Make good with your husband at once. I don't communicate well with men in general... Up there, I got many replacement candidates. Did Mom really stole these? Of course not! The cops were begging for forgiveness! Right? Mom's been weird, but she'd never steal. Heck no! Honey. Give it, I'll return them. Just keep it. What? Are you mad? Cool it. Keep it, I'll take care of it. No, I'll wear whatever's lying around. Just do what I say! I don't want others saying my girl looks crusty. "My girl"? Of course, are you someone else's? DO NOT COMPLY TO REDEVELOPMENT! Take one each. Are you buying? What's got into you? They said redevelopment would be in 5 years, but if they start in 3, where do we go? I know. TO: HK CONSTRUCTION... TO: HK CONSTRUCTION... Yes, Ms. KANG entrusted me before she got into an accident. Yes, I'm her officer manager. I talked to the residents on the phone, and they're willing to accept, if compensation is adequate. ZONE DEMOLITION PLAN Dang it! She did so much for so little. Even gifting the guard with ginseng. Holy cow! Oh yeah, I was supposed to pick you up. How did you get here? Ji-woo's mom said, "get your poop together!" end of message. Vitamin. - Again? - Yes. Go on. It's really sour. You still have to take it. I don't believe it... So sour! What's with the vitamins? - Dad! - My boy! Haru! Had a good day? - Yeah. - Get ready for dinner. I'm home. Did you workout? Why're you out of breath? You know, a little exercise. Tomorrow's that district office gala, can you make it? It's a bit... Well, if it makes you uncomfortable... I can just go alone. Make good with your husband at once I'll go! I'll go with you. That'd make me happy. I'll go wash up. PUBLIC PROJECT SELECTION GALA Honey... Not good? It's great, really pretty. Did you just stutter? So beautiful! I was stunned! Let's go in. Hurry, hurry. Wait... Good evening! I'm KIM Sung-hwan of City Planning. Our district's handsome employee. This is the ward chief. Hello, I'm attorney LEE... I'm his wife KIM Yeon-woo. I checked the budget, and it was very good. He worked so hard for it. - The budget's good... - Yes, sir. But too bad there weren't any new projects. I see. So I proposed subway noise barriers in district 1. The residential area? Isn't that area up for redevelopment? It hasn't been finalized yet. I've looked into it, and concluded that it's not urgent. What's urgent is the sidewalk in district 5. For creating an aesthetic area. Instead of sidewalks, noise barriers are... Ward chief, this way please. Dinner is prepared over there. Will you join us? And Mrs. KIM too. Him as well? Of course. Go ahead. Shall we? Ward chief, isn't the food great? Indeed, it's great. I selected it myself, since your taste buds are very high quality. Your suit looks fantastic too. Thank you so much. Ward chief! I have a question. What could you be curious about? Feel free to speak your mind. Why're sidewalks replaced so frequently? Decent sidewalks are constantly being replaced. Won't the city save money by repairing damaged sections? Trendy designs are constantly changing... It's still concrete. Doesn't impact daily lives much. What's with you? You must be interested in our men's work. Yes, I actually do. Are you from the last century? She has an odd sense of humor... Yeon-woo, please... Let go, let me go! Then which project would impact daily lives? I'm not saying it because it's my husband's idea, but erecting noise barriers is a good idea. Lady. Policy-making isn't like playing Monopoly. The barriers won't mean much to you. It'll be redeveloped, and not many houses too. Please stop. But they're residents of this zone, they've the right to be heard. Every citizen has the right to live in peace, as written in law... Didn't you learn that in primary school? Yes, of course we did. How long till redevelopment? It was originally 5 years from now, but their lawyer pushed the date up, and received consent from the residents, so it'll be in 3 years. Anyway, let's discuss the barriers tomorrow. Tomorrow? Yes, of course. Let go! What's the matter! Are you nuts? Just thank me, I revenged him for you! Revenge? What revenge? Mr. CHOI is still my boss, you can't step all over him! How inconsiderate, I fought so hard for you! Who asked you? Are you a fighter? Then why bring me here?! I wanted to treat you to a fancy dinner! I found you. So you got your wife to help your crusade? Crusade? It's everyone's right! Be quiet. Mr. CHOI, right? Since you're so set on sidewalks, you must've been lobbied hard. What? How dare you... - Let go of me! - Good night. Let go! Both the bastard and the bitch lack class. You're just gonna take it? Watch your mouth! What did you call my wife? How dare you! Sweetie! Sweetie! What happened? - Am I bleeding? - Are you okay? You should've kept your cool. How can I stand by and let him insult my wife? Only fools would let it slide. If you're fired and we go homeless? Then we'll live happily on the streets. Don't worry. I'll never let my family starve even for a day. Why did you give up law school? Why dredge up memories? Are you so bothered that I gave it up? I told you, you didn't do anything wrong. Back then... I had a lovely wife, and an angelic baby, I had responsibilities to fulfill. I can still vividly remember the day she was born. How could a newborn have beautiful eyes like yours? A nurse rolled her up and handed over to me, I made a resolution then. That I'd risk my life to protect my family. As you know, my grandma raised me, and I longed for a family. I find joy in my job, working for the people, listening to their suffering, and solving their problems. You could've made it big being a model with that face... Life isn't all about the money. Thank you. Allow me. Cheers! Yeon-woo, are you asleep? I'm so awake! What should I do? Help me sleep! What should I do? Go to sleep! That horndog... Being a little nice brought out his true nature. Mom! Fine, no biggie. If you want it so badly, I'll do it. Is that rice? What's going on? Did you make up with dad? Why's it weird for a housewife to do housewife stuff? You've been weird lately. Anyway. $10! I got none. Don't be like that. It's not even 7, already heading out? I... am gonna walk with a friend. You're the weird one. Got a boyfriend? No, just a friend. You got one, totally. That's not it! He's so popular, and I'm so petty... What's wrong with you? A bit bratty, but... without your forehead pimple, you're a solid 8. Stop this bullcrap, and give me $10. Fold shopping bags. 3 cents per bag. Folding 300 overnight will net you $9. Are you kidding me?! 'Those who don't work, don't deserve to eat.' That's our motto from today. So annoying... That brat, I'm a bigger brat than you! Look at these toys. My dad had better toys during Korean War. And it's $10. Did you hear? I heard that hag took the money from clothing drive for herself. All of it? She even forces us to buy her mom's stuff, and even takes a portion from the building office. So much greed. Have you seen it yourself? See what? Baseless rumors could lead to a lawsuit. What? What did you say? Who's suing who? Were you talking behind my back? Behind your back?! When did you arrive? - Good evening! - Don't be a kiss ass. Why aren't you buying anchovies? I'm taking names. I bought some. It's delicious. Why aren't you buying? You too. Is she on something? What's with her lately? Maybe she's working for the hag. You know, as a double agent. You're the double agent. - I know... - I bought the smallest one. Haru, are you okay? - You okay? - Yes. Look, you're bleeding. Hold on. Corn man! You're here again? I'm sorry. I'll pay the market fee at the end of the day. No, leave at once. Who pays the fee after market closing? If you take off, I'm the one who's gotta pay. Miss, don't say bad things to dad. You're mean. Have you got no respect for the elders? Educate your kid properly. Please stop, you'll startle the kids. Speak for yourself, you're the one who must stop. Take your kid and get out of here! - Mom. - Haru, what's going on? Let's go. I fell and he helped me up. And that woman is trying to kick him out. Let's go. Are you all here for a show? Nothing to see here, go away! What's going on? This man wants to do business without paying the fee yet again! Did he skip the payment last time? He paid eventually, but today's another story. What if he takes off without paying? You mustn't accuse him as a thief before an act. I'm scared, are you gonna sue me? Sue you? Sure, but I got a question. When exactly was the cell tower erected? Did you all know? What is it? - It's blinking. - What's that? When did we have that? The telecom company should be paying rent, which can be thousands of dollars annually. Are you managing that income for our community? In a few years, that could be tens of thousands. Also, the revenue from bulletin board ads, community market, clothing drive, are all deposited in our account? Of course! I used some for association dinners and official expenses, but that's part of the job. It's actually called 'business embezzlement'. Under Criminal Law Article 356, business embezzlement refers to using others' articles under your care for personal gain, and adheres to 10 years in prison, or maximum of $30,000 fine. What? She's a walking Wikipedia, she memorized a page. You still won't apologize? I'm sorry. I'm really sorry. Yeon-woo, that was so cool! When did you learn all that? She didn't learn it, it's from Wikipedia. Shut your hole, everything's Wikipedia to you! Come on! Actually, my husband taught me. Right, he went to law school. Awesome. What a couple! Good catch! So handsome too. I want my $9.12. Do I need to count? Go right ahead! Bring back 88 cents. What a cheapskate! And you bought a $2,000 coat. Why you little! I'm gonna be late. Why? Going on a date? Come on, mom! Come in. Nobody's home? My parents are on a business trip. Aren't you hot? No, I'm okay. You look cute when you're flustered. Wait, wait! Isn't it a bit too sudden? Why? Don't you like me? Yeah, but it's too fast. Wait, what is that?! Dammit! Can't you even hide it properly? Come on down. What's going on? Don't be so surprised. It's fun to play together. I'm going home. Why? How come? You wanted to be an actress. Think of it as an early debut. You pervert. You fucking bitch! Today is the 10th, so I got 2 weeks left. You're home? What happened? Did something fall? Turn it off, I'm gonna sleep. Get up. Who did this to you? It's nothing, leave me alone! Was it your boyfriend? He's not my boyfriend. You won't talk to me? If you do not talk, no one can help you. Must you speak that way? Can't you just say that I'm safe here, and that everything's gonna be okay? That's what happened... I was so scared... Don't worry. I bit him and ran out of there. What should I do now? Can I still go to school? Of course. Mom will take care of it, so just rest up, okay? As the principal, I don't know what to say. But he came right away to apologize. So... I'm Kyung-hoon's attorney. First of all, I'd like to apologize on his behalf, and we hope to compensate you for any traumas. If you read the compensation details, you'll be satisfied... One moment. Continue in 5? What have I done? How did I live my life? What did I do? This isn't right. I must stay calm, and rational... I'm okay, let's just do what they say. What's okay? We can't... put up a fight against them anyway. It's like smashing a rock with an egg. We have no money, and neck high in debt, let's just settle and go home. Who said we can't fight, if we don't have any money? Mom... Let's go. Keep your chin up, you didn't do anything wrong. Please continue. Even if this case proceeds, he has many options. A few years of study and work abroad will return his life to normalcy. What about your daughter? If this case goes public, her identity will be out in the open, Frankly, this wasn't even rape. Haneul. You don't like Korea, do you? Study abroad, I'll send you. Don't worry, it's not for court, just an insurance. Let's follow the law. I know a law or two. I suddenly got a desire to ruin that bastard's life. - Mrs. KIM... - Yeah, I know. The fight will be long and draining. But I fully intend to give him hell for that duration. Go abroad? Please do. Whatever country you step on, I'll make sure to let everyone know that you're an attempted rapist. I'll make it happen. In addition to full extend of the law, I'll use all manners of social media like blogs, Twitter, Facebook, to ensure no one forgets you even after a decade! You be ready, okay? Honey, get up. - Mrs. KIM. - Utter another word! And I'm calling your superior! Shit! What the fuck then?! It was a fucking mistake! What about the bitch who followed me in? Did you just call my daughter a bitch? I'll teach you what you have to do. Lower your head and apologize, asshole! Will it be okay? Don't worry. I made an offer they can't refuse. Immediate transfer, official apology, and compensation. Honestly, you felt like a stranger, and odd at times, but now I'm sure you're my mother. You were pretty cool. You'll keep folding bags, right? Come on! Mood spoiler! What, you won't fold? I'll fold. Wear this tie instead. Yeah? Thanks. Haneul, breakfast done? Mom, I folded 150. Really? 150 is $4.50. I folded the rest for you, aren't I cool? So cool! Thanks, I'm off! - Come home early! - Okay! Haru! Haru! Are you awake? You're late, come on. Go wash up. - And brush your teeth. - I'm late, something smells good! Let's eat. - What is it? - Smells good, right? Tada! - Eat with me. - I'll eat with Haru. It's amazing. - Morning! - Hello there. What a sweetheart! Banana's expensive. Thank you! Let's go, Squiddy. Seriously! - Everything's good here? - Holy cow! Good morning. Have you finally accepted them as your family? Well, yes. You got a week left. Are you sad? Yes, a little. How exactly do I die? Didn't I tell you? Car accident. Then... those loving children will lose their mother in a week without any warning? Isn't that too brutal for them to take in? Do you want to minimize their pain? Yes. If possible, absolutely. Then within the time you have, give them lots of love. You take care now. You look all rosy, like a newly wed. Too obvious? My life is golden right now. It's all thanks to me. It's law of conservation of mass, thanks to my unhappiness. - Be thankful. - Thanks, bud. Thanks, you prick! Now I know that stupid law actually works! Mr. KIM! The transfer came through. So sweet, nice. Chief. What is this? I never requested a transfer. Got a proof that you didn't? Ward chief signed off on it, so pack up. Sir. I'm really sorry about that night. Forgive me, and please reinstate me. Keep a lid on that wife of yours. She needs to be taught a lesson. Gonna hit me again? I'll go, so do not bring up my wife again. If not, I may not hold back. First date in a long time. It's been way too long. If I... - suddenly... - Yeon-woo. I got transferred to the country. What? I need to head down next month, so... Is this his revenge? From that bastard boss? I'll try to come back up as soon as possible. It's because of me... It's all my fault. I'm sorry. Yeon-woo, you didn't do anything wrong. Not a thing, it's okay. It's okay. Too sweet. Thank you for seeing me during your busy day. The transfer is finalized, so don't even bring it up. What must I do to make you happy? I'll kneel if you want me to. I'm begging you. I'm not a gangster, don't kneel at my feet. Take this opportunity to live quietly down south. There really is no other way? Office is a cold-hearted place. Take that to heart, woman. Sit back down. I got important work. I know you're busy, but sit down. Hello, Ms. KIM of HK Construction? I'm attorney LEE Yeon-woo, who is in charge of HK's redevelopment project. I got a question, has HK lobbied any civil servants? Is chief CHOI Su-chul on that list? Okay, thank you. Who are you? What are you? Me? KIM Sung-hwan's wife. Don't just look, pick one. No, I gotta get mom's menopause pills. Menopause? She was sick but she's better now. That's so cute. Good bye. Huh? Hey, kid? Are you okay? Where is the ER? KIM Haru, he's a boy. He's 6 years old. Are you the guardian? Mother, I'm his mom. It's retinitis pigmentosa. The vision becomes cloudy at times. He probably fell because of it. Retinitis pigmentosa? It must've degenerated very rapidly recently. It'd have been hard on him. Is it treatable? An operation is required, but we can't rule out losing sight completely. Why did this happen to him? There's... a high chance of genetics. Most likely genetics. Ma'am, it says you lost sight in one eye because of it. I recovered after multiple retinal surgeries. It was a huge financial burden on us. I resented my mother for it, I must've blocked that memory out. Naturally, I never thought about it! Then how? How could this happen? How is this possible? This isn't fair! What's not fair? I'm a temporary mom, no, I'm playing a role! Then how could he inherit it from me? Because you're his mom. How am I his mother?! The woman who died 3 weeks ago is his mother! - Ms. LEE. - But I! I'm the one who committed sins while living. If you wanted to punish, you should've punished me! Why punish an innocent child? This is how you balance the world? You were here? I've been looking for you. It's okay. It's okay, we must stay strong for our boy. He'll be fine after the surgery. Pills working? Don't touch your wound. Okay, thank you. It'll be fine. You're a strong boy. I don't... even remember my dad's face. I hated my mom for missing him endlessly, so I took his clothes and photos, and burned everything. I hated my dad so much. I hated him for leaving my mom and I alone. I lived hard to be strong. I never wanted to rely on anyone. But despite all the success, we want someone to lean on when in a pinch, and we need people to love in order to be happy... I never realized it. SURGERY STATUS: KIM HARU OPERATION ROOM Your time's up, please get in. I can't go now. I have to see him wake up. You must leave now, there's no time. He's suffering because of me, can't I at least see him wake up? I warned you not to interfere with your previous life. I apologized profusely for that. So please. This is an unforeseen consequence of your action. If I get in this car, everything'll work out? Even if it means I can't see my family? Are you saying you want to remain here as Haru's mother? Forfeit your previous life? Yes, if it's possible, I want to! I'll forfeit my life as a lawyer, so please! Ms. LEE! If you disappear, Haru's illness will be gone. Do you not understand? If I disappear? So get in the car. What are you doing? Let go! Let me say good bye! Please! Please let me go! Must you go this far? I'm begging you! Don't do this! I can't give you a lot of time. Go on. - Mom. - You're back. How's Haru? He's there, I'm going to admin office. Since you're here, I'm off to class. Haneul, wait! You'll become a great actress, I believe in you. What's with the love? Please be happy, okay? Fine, don't overreact. He'll be fine, don't worry. I'll come back afterwards, see you soon! Mom? Yeah. You're a strong boy. I know you can't see me, but can you hear me? Yeah, clearly. Your voice is so pretty. There's something I have to do, so I must leave for a bit. Can you stay strong even without mom? I won't cause any trouble. But come back soon. Are you crying? No! Don't... forget that I love you so much. Yup, I love you so much. Yeon-woo, you must be starving. Go get something to eat. Go on. Could you call me 'honey' instead? But you didn't want me to. Okay, honey. Sorry, I'm leaving you so much baggage. Don't sound like you're leaving for good. Honey. Take good care of Haneul and Haru. While you get some food? I got it. All right, so go on. Whoa! Doctor, Ms. LEE Yeon-woo of 801 just woke up. Ma'am, can you hear me? Who is it? Isn't this Haneul's home? No, it isn't. Don't Haneul, Haru and Sung-hwan live here? They don't live here. Mom! Mom! Mom! Mom! 1 month later Proof of HK's embezzlement, and that chairman PARK's alibi are all fake. But why? I wish I could blow the whistle, but you can do it. You're better at flipping over the table. What's with you? This isn't you. I had a dream recently, a spectacular dream. Dream? So what? Why the move all of sudden? I feel so lonely living here. What is that you eat daily? It's a secret. It looks so old. My mom's things. Bask in the memories. I'll pack up your room. KOREAN FISHING VESSEL SANK SUNK IN NEW ZEALAND SEA Dad? I love you more than anything. So much. Dad... Are you watching me? I miss you so, so much. He's so handsome. Mom, I know you loved me just as much as dad. Thanks for raising a brat. I'll be back, be well. You know I've been busy, I want to cool off. You're going to New Zealand to cool off? In any case, take it easy out there. Don't cause any stink. I'll call when I touch down. Talk to you later. I'm sorry. 5G. Lady, I'm next to you. Haru! How do you know my name? Why are you here? Can you read that letter? Lady, I can read the alphabets. You brat! My apologies if my kid gave you trouble. To your seats. Why are you flying to New Zealand? My mom went to heaven recently. Hey! I'm so sorry. Not at all. I got a sister there, and hope to live there for a bit. I see... What about you? To visiting my dad. I see...
