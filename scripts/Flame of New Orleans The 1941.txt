For instance, has anyone in this audience ever seen a wedding dress floating down that river? Here, oddly enough, is just that. How, you may ask, does a wedding dress happen to be on the Mississippi River? Which is what these fishermen are asking this very moment. Yes, it's an empty wedding dress, and the bride is gone. And this is how was startzed the legend of the Countess of New Orleans... who disappeared a century ago- exactly a century ago this coming Saturday, on the day ofher wedding. Mr. Charles! Mr. Charles! Why would a girl who had everything to live for... do this? On her wedding day. [Narrator] These people never found out what happened, but you will. Before we open this door, a little secret. This, uh, countess we mentioned is not really a countess. Shh. Open, please. We're late for the opera. Thank you. The show has already begun, but never fear. We're in time for the beginning of our story, and we hope you enjoy it. Good night. [Orchestra] [Man Singing Opera In Italian] [Continues] [Woman Singing Opera In Italian] [Singing Together] [Opera Continues] [Woman Singing Aria] My, what's happenin'? Guess someBody done fainted. [Continues] Oh, sir. Oh, please, everyBody. Stop crowding. Give Madame some air. Are you-Are you feeling Better? I'm so sorry. Oh, please. It was a pleasure. That's your mistress that fainted. Yes.

Can't you feel it? [No AudiBle Dialogue] You afraid of the dark? You're not so dark. How's your mistress like New Orleans so far? Oh, it's all right for a small town. A small town? New Orleans? Well, after Paris, London and Vienny," this ain't much of a town. My, my! She's the most Beautiful woman in New Orleans. Thank you. After you. Come, come. There must Be some way to meet the countess. Where does she go shopping? In Paris. Ah. Hmm. Where does she go walking? In the courtyard. Uh-huh. Well, she must leave the house sometime. Only to take a drive in the park. Drive. Driving. Aha. [Chuckling] Oh, thank- Oh! Where did you get these... in the daytime? I was BriBed. BriBed? Someone's gonna insult you today, if you get out of Bed. The Banker? Where? How? When you're drivin' in the park, a Big man's gonna get in an argument with you. And Mr. Giraud- that's the Banker's name- is gonna come along- And give him a good Beating, after which I throw my arms around his neck. Pretty old. What do you mean By talking to a lady in this fashion? Do you want to make something out of it? No. [Whining] Do you want to make something out of it?" No. [Loudly] Do you want to make something out of it! Yes, sir. What do you mean By talking to a lady in this fashion? Uh, do you care to make anything out of it, sir? [Groaning] [Man] Be careful! Stop! Stop! Stop the carriage. Driver, can't you hear me? Whoa. Whoa. [Man] Excuse me. I'll only keep you a minute. Don't move till I get through here. This monkey's one of the family. Nice, Jacques. Nice. Don't Be frightened. You're not hurt. Don't cry now. Just hold on to my hand. Nice, Jacques. You want to take a little drive in the park, eh? Why did you stop, Samuel? Drive on. [Man] Wait a minute. I haven't got him loose yet. Can't you hear me? Stop the horses! Hey, stop that! Now, you're a very lucky lady. You have no idea how lucky you are. My monkey shouldn't have run into the road. But, on the other hand, when someone hollers at you to stop, you can't be in such a hurry you can't find out what he's hollering about. - Do you hear me Behind that umBrella? - Drive on, Samuel. [Man] Are you crazy? One move out of this carriage, and you'll both get a surprise. - Git. Git. - [Chittering] One, two, three! [Chittering] I don't understand this, Madame. You don't understand it? Do you, uh, want to make something out of her? Do you want to make something out of it? Oh, yes, sir. Yes, sir. Careful. Here comes someBody. That's the one. Stop the horses. Stop! Stop! Stop! Madame, we's Been attack-ted" again. [Whistling, Humming] [Humming Continues] One of'em had me By the throat like this. Another one had the horses By the throat like this. Then two other scoundrels had pistols to my head. Then another scoundrel sneaked up and pulled out his knife. [All Laughing] Now, that makes five scoundrels! Thought you said there was only four. [Crowd Laughing] Wait for me. [Countess Humming] [Laughing] [Whistling, Humming] Clementine, I'm going to New York! I can't get any money from the men in this town. [Humming Resumes] I understood Madame had Been assaulted while driving, and I came to offer my services. But I seem to have come at the wrong time. Just a minute, please! [Humming] He downstairs. What? Mr. Giraud. He heard every word. Oh! Go down and tell him I'm not at home. No, no, no. That's no good. Who could we say is up here? [Clementine] Oh, sir? Madame will Be right down. Well. Madame say, won't you please come in the parlor and rest yourself. Oh, well- When a day start wrong, it look like everything happens. First that old man who turned the carriage over, and now this awful person. [Door Closes] Clementine, I'm going! If the countess doesn't want to see me, I don't want to see her either. Tell her that! Madame is too softhearted. Family trouBle? Yes, sir. Who is she? I can't tell you. I just can't. And good-Bye! [Door Slams] A woman alone is helpless. I'm not going to let your attacker go unpunished. But I don't know what he looks like. I only saw his feet. His feet? [Chuckles] Enough. Now, look carefully. Are those the ones? No. That eliminates him. Every night, we'll eliminate one person. There are a hundred thousand men in New Orleans... with feet. [Chuckles] [Orchestra: Circus] [Chattering, Laughing] Did you see that? I can do that. Aw, it's a trick. He puts that sticky stuff on the rope. No, no. The sticky stuff is on his shoes! No, no. I know the secret. The whole thing's keeping your ears on the level. [All Laughing] You watch me keep watching my ears. May I? Why, sure. Hey! Hey! Don't worry, partner. I'm worried. He's Been drinkin' a little. What's that got to do with his ears? [Circus Continues] [People Gasping] That's the monkey! There are the feet! - I mean, there's the man! - [Crowd Screaming] Don't worry, I'm not gonna fall on you. I'm sure he's the one. I'd know him anywhere. Please don't excite yourself. I'll deal with our friend. [Chittering] [Crowd Screaming] I'm sorry. I thought I'd hit the pole. I'm sorry. I don't approve of turning over carriages in the park. My seconds will expect yours tomorrow. Why tomorrow? My seconds are here. [Whistles] You may choose your weapons! I get the choice? You do! Say, which lady was in the carriage? The skinny one? You have insulted the countess! Well, what do you think of that? What weapons do you choose, sir? Weapons? Oh, yes. Uh- May I Borrow this? Thank you. This is a very unusual type of duel. It comes from Trinidad, the southern part ofTrinidad. Pardon me. Thank you. It's called Rulli Bah Suba, which means shut your mouth." The rules are very simple. A child could follow them. Would you Be seated? The important thing in the duel... is the handkerchief. Andrew! [Woman Gasping] That's yours. Now, we each take one end of the handkerchief. You take the other end. And you put it Between your teeth. Like this. The important thing to rememBer is not to let the handkerchief go. Can you rememBer that? Now, you hold your knife like this. And when someBody counts to three, you can pull the knife from the taBle and attack. The one who drops the handkerchief first- He loses. That's why it's called shut your mouth." Now, will someBody please count to three? - AnyBody. - I'll count. I'll count. I'll count. One. Now I'll say two. No, no. Let me. You said one. Now I wanna say two. All right. You say two. I'll say three. No, no. We'll say three together. [Andrew] Two! Now together. [Countess] Stop! Why, this isn't the man at all. I've made a terriBle mistake. Really? [Sighs] [Countess] I don't know what I can possibly say. Will you please forgive me and accept my apology? And my apology, sir. I'd never have forgiven myself if I had harmed you. I don't see how I could have thought you were the other man. He was much shorter... and Blond. Won't you join us, Mr. Uh- Latour. RoBert Latour. Mr. Latour. [Orchestra: Classical] I would like to propose a toast. To the most beautiful lady who has ever visited our New Orleans. May your stay Become permanent. [Glass Shatters] I'm sorry he wasn't the man. It deprived me of the privilege of fighting for you. I'm glad. By accident, you might have Been harmed. And I wouldn't have wanted that to happen. You know that short, Blond fellow in the park? I know him very well. He's charming... and a gentleman. I'll always Be in his deBt. [Whistling] Oh, for the life of a sailor [Whistling] Oh, for the life of the sea With a pal to starBoard or lee With a gal in port for your knee Yo-ho for the salt of the sea Look who's here. It couldn't Be Don Juan. No, it couldn't Be him. I know where he is. This must Be a mirage. It looks like him. [Sailor] Hey, cook, I forgot to tell you. Don't bother to make breakfast in the morning for our captain. No, a lady's gonna cook it, and with her own little hands. EveryBody Below! I want everyBody up at dawn tomorrow to go lookin' around for a cargo. What do you think I'm runnin' here, a rest home? [Strums] I heard that. Mo' flowers. Any note? No, Madame. You got yourself all prettied up for nothin'. Mr. Giraud ain't comin' around today. How do you know? William say he got a touch of the gout. Gout? What a Boring town. You don't catch men in Paris having gout. Got a good mind to go Back there. You mayBe got a good mind, But you ain't got the Boat fare. Oh, money! There are other things in the world Beside money. [Monkey Chittering] [Latour] Jacques, come back here! Jacques! Jacques, what are you doing? Jacques! Jacques, come back here! Excuse me. My monkey jumped in the window. I was just passing. I'm awful sorry. Just pick him up. He won't bite you. I can't catch the monkey. And, uh, I'm afraid of it. I think you'll have to get it yourself. I'll Be right in. I hope he didn't frighten you. Mm. Just a little. I was just taking him for a walk. There isn't much room on the Boat. You have a Boat? Oh, yes. The water must Be Beautiful on these moonlit nights. Yes, it is. I've never seen it. Would you like to see it? Oh, yes, I would. Tonight! I'm sure you'd like it. I'm sure I will. MayBe- MayBe we could have supper together. [Latour] I know we'll have a bright moon. That's very importzant. This is the best time of the year for it. Is it really? I can hardly wait. Just till tonight. Shh. [Man] 110, 120, 130, 40, 50- $ 150. Do you understand that the Boat is not to leave the dock... until the loan has Been repaid to us? Oh, sure. Good day. Good day. [Groans] Is this all you've done? Well, I just- This Boat looks like a pigpen. You want her to think we live like this? Well, don't we? Get on with that cleaning. Yes, sir, Captain. Turn 'em over! Look at those nails! There's enough dirt under there to grow a rose Bush. Dig it out. Yes, sir. Now, you Behave yourself, partner. Madame, I'm against this. You're against this? Yes, I am. Why don't you go for a long walk in the park and get your mind off him? Why don't you get your mind off William? That ain't the same. Every woman needs a little William. [Knocking] Who's that? Whoever it is, I'm not at home. Is Madame at home? Is Madame at home? Uh, yes, sir. Yes, she is. Won't you come in? Madame is in the parlor, sir. [Clementine] Mr. Giraud. Oh, what a wonderful surprise. I thought you'd Be surprised. You may go now, Clementine. I'll see you later. Yes, Madame. What has happened? A very unruly horse and I met in a clash of wills. He is now quite gentle. You're so dominating. I hope so, my dear. I hope so. All the men in my family have Been impulsive. I myself would never have dared to- to presume so soon. Except that my aunt urged me to do so, knowing my true feelings. She points out that there are few families in this new world suitaBle for an alliance, and she is right. You mean... marriage? Madame, you must forgive this- this ill-mannered haste, But my aunt urged me to speak at once. The women in my family are very impulsive too. My answer to you is... yes. Fate made me stay home tonight. I know now I was waiting for you. You are too good for me. No, I'm not. Oh, yes, you are. No, I'm not. Oh, yes, you are. No, I'm not. [Giggling] One of you has always got to Be in this caBin. If you're takin' out the soup plates, you wait here until he comes Back with the chicken. Because she's a lady, and you must never emBarrass a lady... By leavin' her alone with a- with a gentleman. [Andrew] Here comes the carriage! Good evenin', Mr. Latour. Good evening. Good evening. Oh, Madame, she ain't here. Where is she? Madame say, will you please excuse her? She can't come. Why not? She ain't feelin' so good. Oh. She ain't complainin' Do you think she may Be feeling Better a little later on? Not tonight, and I don't think she'll Be Better tomorrow. Or even the day after. Poor Madame. She very brave. Mr. Latour, I wouldn't have knowed you from a gentleman. You like it, huh? Yes, sir. Good night. Good night. Too Bad. She's sick. But she isn't complaining. She isn't? MayBe she oughta have a doctor. Yeah, mayBe she oughta. She proBaBly doesn't even know a doctor here. No, she proBaBly don't. All alone in that house without a man. Why, that's terriBle! Yeah, that's terriBle. [Playing Piano: Classical] Doesn't she play delightfully, Auntie? Uh- Oh, yes. Don't you think so, dear? Delightfully. My wife plays the harp, you know. Professional jealousy. Nonsense. We can play duets together. What exciting evenings are ahead! Oh, charming. Charming. [Carriage Approaching] [Coachman] Whoa. Whoa. How did you get here? I thought mayBe she'd need me. [Piano Continues] She must've got Better. I'd like to see her. No, you stay here. I'll tell her you've come. [Guests Laughing] He followed me here. He right outside there. He heard the music and everything. [Knocking] Oh, I knowed somethin' like this would happen. Not so quick. [Knocking Continues] How can you ever forgive me? I started to feel Better as soon as my servant left. I even tried to call her Back, But then some of the family dropped in unexpectedly. You know how families are. Oh. Oh, sure. I knew you'd understand. You're one of the most understanding men I've ever met. It's nothin'. I hope I didn't put you to any trouBle. I didn't go to any trouBle. I just had a little snack fixed up, But I can eat it myself. I'm so glad. Aw, what's a couple of chickens? You're making me feel much Better. [Chuckles] Good night. Good night. Good night. Good night. [Guests Laughing] [Laughing] I didn't know Giraud was in your family. There's more to Being a gentleman than wearing tight pants. When a lady says she is ill, she's ill. And a gentleman doesn't go around looking into windows. And one more free piece of advice. Stay a sailor, sailor. It Becomes you more. [Door Closes] Where shall I put these? Put 'em anywhere. Your hat. Clementine. All right. Give it to me. I'll give it to Madame. No. I have to give it to her personally. This way. Are you noticing how it drapes, how it clings? May I speak frankly? Yes. This cape is deliBerately... revealing. Cross again. He's got somethin'. From Mr. Giraud. Oh. Oh! Oh! Oh. Two more days to the wedding, and then you're all mine. You emBarrass me. You emBarrass easily. I'm doing so many strange things. You know, I've never accepted presents from a man Before. Don't worry, my dear. You'll get used to it. Here she is. Ask her. You must sing for us. We can't wait to hear you. Oh, no, please. We won't take no for an answer. Charles. I order you to sing, my dear. I'll arrange it. He's so dominating. She's going to sing. How delightful! Claire's going to sing. Oh, that's nice, Charles. Yes, isn't it? Yes. How a grown man can act so silly is Beyond me. It's not Beyond me. Well, you're proBaBly attracted to that... type. She grows on one. [Chuckles] I wish she'd grow on me. I should think you'd have some resentment at the size of this reception. I'm just as upset as you are. I didn't count on your decrepit Brother getting married. Did you marry me for my money? Well, uh, yes and no. What do you mean, yes and no? I mean yes. Aren't you going to miss Europe? She could go aBroad every year. No, it's another world. I'll never go Back. Good-Bye, Europe. I'll wait here for you. Don't Be long. Oh, come on in. There are some men here you'll like. Look here. I've Been for four weeks on a Boat. I don't like men tonight. Not even you. Well, there are women here. Mm, with husBands. I'll just say hello to my friend, and we'll Be out of here in two minutes. Fine. Will you please excuse me? I don't Believe my eyes. Tell me I'm not dreaming. Pinch me someplace- anyplace. If you don't pinch me, I'm gonna pinch you. [Chuckles] I am Zolotov. Don't you rememBer? Saint PetersBurg? What are you doing here? I'm going to sing. You're a singer now? Excuse me. Don't you feel well? Oh, yes. I feel fine. Uh-huh. You're just nervous. But you needn't Be. We all love you. We can go now. Oh, no. Now we are staying. I just met a girl here whom I used to know in Saint PetersBurg. I didn't exactly know her, But I know stories aBout her. What a girl. What stories. She says she's a singer now. [Piano: Ballad] Sweet is the Blush of May When love is a Budding rose When shy is the glance Of eyes where romance dances merrily, merrily Sweet is the blush of May [Playing Piano] So come, be gay Let thejoy of spring hold sway For spring is love And the heartz of spring is May [Piano Continues] [No AudiBle Dialogue] Pale is the blush of May When cool is the heart of love And still is the stream That danced to the theme of I'm ever thine Ever thine Pale is the blush of May [Piano Continues] [No AudiBle Dialogue] So come, Be gay Let the joy of spring hold sway For spring is love And the heartz of spring is May [No AudiBle Dialogue] [Playing Piano] Sweet is the blush of May When two heartzs in love entwine And blessed is the pair That chooses to share love forevermore Evermore Sweet is the blush of May So come, be gay Let thejoy of spring hold sway For spring is love And the heart of spring is May [Guests Applauding] [Guests Chattering, Exclaiming] Hurry, hurry. Here are your things. Will you kindly repeat what you said aBout my fiance? I didn't know she was your fiance. My seconds will call on you in the morning. There is no need of them to call. In the first place, I made a terriBle mistake. The girl, I mean- She only looks like her. And in the second place, I don't see very well. I usually wear glasses- thick ones. And in the third place, it's pretty dark in the other room. What time will it Be convenient for my seconds to call on you? Anytime. I mean- I really wasn't speaking aBout your fiance, Believe me. There was a certain girl in Saint PetersBurg. And she had a trick of fainting. Fainting? Y-Yes. Well, I shan't keep you any longer away from your guests. Remind me to tell you all aBout it someday. I must Be going now. Lovely party, and I hope you'll Be very happy. Good-Bye. [People Gasp] [Woman] What happened? [Man] What's the matter? She's- She's fainted! You shouldn't have fainted. Oh, I didn't know what else to do. What time will he Be here tomorrow? 2:00. We is ruined. That's it. We is ruined. We'll Be thrown out in the street. I knowed this was too good to last. Quiet. Let me think. Let me think. [Scoffs] There ain't no use thinking. We is ruined. You ain't gonna fool him this time like you did before, inventin'somebody illegitimate in the family and blame it on her. Charles, Be firm. RememBer the family. I'm not a child, you know. And don't forget the necklace. Don't Be nervous. Shh. [Knocking] Good-Bye. Good-Bye! Are you afraid to come out and say good-Bye? And count your silver. I stole some. Don't Be in such a hurry to close the door, or I'll Break your arm off. Won't you step inside, please? Huh? Looks like every time you come, Mr. Giraud, you got to see that girl. Huh? Yes, yes. Mm-hmm. I'll tell Madame you is here, sir. Eh? Certainly, certainly. You never saw a Body so surprised in your life. He dumfounded. Do I look all right? Fine. Good afternoon, Charles. Good afternoon. Won't you sit down? Thank you. Don't you feel well? Huh? Oh, I'm fine, fine. Yes. That-That girl I just met- She's your twin? I Beg your pardon. Oh, excuse me. Who is she? She Belongs to my family, in a way. An uncle of mine- Before his marriage. You understand? I understand, yes. How does she happen to Be here? I thought if I Brought her to this new world, she'd lead a Better life. She was terriBle aBroad. Just terriBle. That's very interesting. I wish she had stayed where she was. I'd like to ask you a few questions. I wish she had stayed in Saint PetersBurg. Were you ever in Saint- Saint PetersBurg! What's the matter, Charles? Was she ever in Saint PetersBurg? Oh, yes. Why? Were you ever there? Oh, no. It's much too cold. And I don't like Russians. Oh. Claire, this is important. Very important. What, Charles? That girl that just left here? Yes? I want you to Bring her to me. That would Be very difficult. But I must see her. I aBsolutely must. Why? Please don't ask any questions, But trust me. Our happiness depends on it. Our happiness depends on that girl? I don't see how. Well, not exactly. But you see, my family must Be convinced. You see- Oh, I can't explain. My dear, we must see that girl, and you must help me. I don't know what's on your mind, But I will never permit you to see me with that girl. Then I must speak frankly, Claire. We cannot Be married until I find that girl. Then we cannot Be married. Good day. Very well. I shall find that girl myself. I'll search everywhere. Every nook and cranny in New Orleans. Good day. [Door Slams] [No AudiBle Dialogue] Uh-oh. There's Mr. Giraud's Brother-in-law. That's Bad. A crowded place where they won't see me too clearly. Where? Yes, yes. But wait and see how this whole story is going to sound to Auntie. Come on. Wait. Wait. Can I speak? Yes, certainly. I know where you can find that girl. Where? Most every night, she's at the Oyster Bed. Shh. It's a caf. Ha! That's where we're going.

Where can I find your Russian friend? Charles, there's no use looking for him. He will not take part in a duel. I am not interested in that. He told me yesterday that dueling is against his religion. And anyway, he's in the diplomatic service of the czar. He isn't allowed to Be killed. Is it against his religion to go to a caf? Oh, yes, aBsolutely forBidden. A caf? What's at a caf? An old friend of his we want him to identify. Come on. But he said that he would Be Busy in the middle of diplomatic Business today, and- You mean you're an underwear salesman from Saint PetersBurg?

Waiter. How much? Ten cents. Something happen to your appointment? Looks like it. I'm through here at 2:00. I'll think it over. I'll wear a coat. - [Loud Slap] - I didn't do it. Lily, don't you rememBer me? Oh, Saint PetersBurg. Can I see you later tonight? MayBe I'll Be Back. I've got a date, But- Sorry aBout the slap. You proBaBly deserved it for something else. What do you say now? There is a resemBlance. But I don't see how you could confuse one with the other. I've Been rammed. Excuse me. You're a new one here. And it's aBout time. Hey, look what I got.

Let go of me. You're hurting my arm. You get out of this place and never come Back here. I don't know you. But I know you. You're an immoral, ungrateful girl... who's been taking advantage of the countess long enough. Oh, you're the one she's going to marry. I didn't get my invitation to the wedding. Not another word out of you! Not one word! That's all right, Mr. Giraud. I'll take care of her. A very nice family. Just wonderful. Have a drink. Some other time. I have to go. Wait a minute. Are you her twin sister? No. We're kind of cousins. Oh. Is- Is she gonna marry him? Tomorrow. Tomorrow. Hmm. I wish her luck. Are you in love with her? I hit my Best friend the day Before yesterday. I've Been drunk for a week. I'm losing my Boat Because I won't work. Must Be something. You're not in love. You're just impressed with a lady. You're right. I'm just impressed with a lady. I guess I must've said that now aBout 10,000 times. I oughta Be convinced, huh? Aren't you? Sure I am. Can't you tell? If I were you, I'd forget her. Who? I can't even rememBer who you're talking aBout. I'm talking aBout someone... who's not good enough for you. Beat it. Go on. Go home. Say. Don't you ever tell her what I said. Not one word. Do you understand? I won't. She will never even see me again. Good-Bye. You'll drink later. You and I have a little Business deal to discuss. Come on. [Scoffs] Can't we discuss it here? No. We have to hurry. The $150 that you Borrowed from our Bank, my friend- have you got it? Well, no, But I'm looking for a cargo now. It's a little late, isn't it? It was due two days ago. Two days ago? Legally, we could sell your Boat. Can't you give me a few days to try and find a cargo? Take that girl out of New Orleans, and we'll cancel your deBt. Kidnapping, eh? Oh, she'll proBaBly Be glad to go. A girl like that? Why not? Not on my Boat. Your Boat? For how long? Don't Be foolish. Come on or, we'll lose her. Mr. Giraud, I'll give you $300 if you can wait a month. Shh. Don't talk so loudly. That's douBle your money. Shh. No, I'm not interested. Either you'll lose your Boat, or you'll take that girl and- Did she mention that she was going to her cousin? She said she'd never see her again. Something mysterious going on here. Come on. If she were expecting her, there'd Be some lights. There's a light. There's no telling what a girl like that might Be up to, you know. I want to see what's going on. Give me a hand. Take this. Now, give me a lift. Care-Careful. The light went out. It's over there now. Thank you! [Whispering] Shh. Not so loud. ClimB on those vines. - They wouldn't hold me. You climB on 'em. - Huh? Go on, you idiot, Before something happens in there. Quiet. What's happening? The girl from the caf is there. And the countess? I don't see her. [No AudiBle Dialogue] [Giraud] Speak up, you idiot. Is the countess there yet? Answer me. Is she there? Yeah, she's there. They're Both there. Are-Are they close together? Oh, very close. D-Does it look as though there'll be violence? I don't think so. Do you think she might strike her? Hardly. This is all your fault, stupid. If you'd kidnapped her on the way here, this wouldn't have happened. Now, are you going to take that girl away tonight, or aren't you? Tonight? Yes. I guess I haven't any choice. I'll do it. That's Better. Why are you smiling? I'm not smiling. Is my fiance fully dressed? Oh, yes, certainly. Get down. Get off. We're gonna fall. What's that? [Screams] What you doin' down there? Tell Madame that I'm waiting for the girl who just went in the house. I'm in no hurry. I'll wait right here. [Gasps] It's the sailor. He followed me here? He gonna stay all night. I'll get rid of him. Tell him... I'll Be right down. She'll Be right down. Ow! Turned my ankle. Everything's comin' out fine. Come over here. I want you to follow my instructions to the letter. Yes, Mr. Giraud. When the girl comes down here, you engage her in conversation. Yes, Mr. Giraud. I will drive By here in the carriage. The door will open. You seize the girl and push her inside. That's very clever, Mr. Giraud. Nothing. Ha. I'm off. [Latour] Here I am. What took you so long? What do you mean By following me here? I just felt lonely. Where are you taking me? Home. Oh, such a long walk. I'm going to ask my cousin to let me sleep here tonight. Why? You tired? Yes. I'll carry you home. Carry me? Certainly. This is the only way to travel. Put me down. Wouldn't it Be nice if that carriage would stop? MayBe the door will open. [Latour] This is unbelievable. Put me down! Let me down! No, I don't want to! No! You must Be quiet. We mustn't disturB, uh, your cousin. This is just a sample of what you can expect... if you ever set foot in New Orleans again. You have no right to do this. I shall have the right tomorrow at noon... as head of the family when I marry the countess. Here's a little something extra for you. Thank you, Mr. Giraud. I'll cancel your note tomorrow. Thank you, Mr. Giraud. Help! Let me go. [Latour] Easy now. Take it easy. [Countess] Let me go! Turner, to the docks, quickly as possiBle. Yes, sir. [Countess, Muffled] Help! Help! Let me go! Ow! [Muffled] Help! Let me go! Well, never looked good on me anyway. Now, why Be angry? You haven't Been hurt, and you got me my Boat Back. After all, I owe you something for that. Want an apple? A man who'd kidnap a woman would do anything for money. Well, most people are like that- do anything for money. Wouldn't you? No. You got a Better character than I have. But don't worry. I don't kidnap women. You can go if you like. Do you mean that? Certainly. But he paid you to take me away. I don't care aBout him. And I may never Be Back here. I can leave right now? If you don't want to stay. I knew you were a gentleman. Oh, no. Just a sailor. And I'm going to stay a sailor. It's funny your Being here. Your cousin, the, uh- the countess, was supposed to come to this very caBin one night. You know that money I Borrowed from Giraud? What do you think I Bought with it? Gentlemen's clothes. Huh. And-And that shawl you're sitting on. She never sat on it. No, she was just amusing herself with me. No, she wasn't. How do you know? MayBe she wasn't. I thought you didn't like her. I don't. Well, what excuse could she have had? Women have to do things for a lot of reasons. MayBe. Well, I don't care. I'll pay her Back... in my own way. How? I've got a peculiar feeling somehow... that, sooner than you think, she's gonna fall right into my hands. Can I go now? Certainly. I appreciate this very much. [Chuckles] Good-Bye. Come here. I said come here. You're walkin' so slow. Come closer. I forgot to tell you something. You seem nervous. I'm not nervous. Why did you kiss me in the caf tonight? Answer me. Why? Was it Because you felt sorry for me? Yes. The countess treated me pretty dirty, huh? She ought to Be punished. Huh? I'm glad you agree with me. What's the hurry? You want to Be at your cousin's wedding? I'll let you go in plenty of time. We can talk a little. Then you can leave. [No AudiBle Dialogue] Look how nice the sky is. Uh-huh. It's going to Be a Beautiful day. Just right for a wedding. Isn't it? Yes. I imagine she'll Be very happy. Let's not talk aBout her. Why not? When do you sail? Half an hour. I'd Better go now. We'll never see each other again. We might. Never. You'll Be far away. And even if you come Back, you won't find me. I'll find ya. You might not recognize me. The next time I see you, I'll just look at you and you'll look at me. And wherever we are, you'll come to me. Won't ya? Good-Bye. Good-Bye. [Bells Tolling] Claire, here are three more cousins.
