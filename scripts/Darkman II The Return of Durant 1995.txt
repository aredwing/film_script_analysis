Durant. [ Screaming ] [ Gas Hissing ] He ripped everything from my life, everything that was precious to me. Durant burned away my identity... [ Screaming ] Leaving me for dead... not knowing he had created a monster. [ Groans ] My science is my only existence now. [ Female Computer Voice ] Synthetic digitization complete. [ Westlake ] Yes. My synthetic skin formula gave me back my face. [ Computer] Photosensitivity reaction. But only for 99 minutes. [ Computer] Skin matrix dissolving in 99 minutes. [ Computer] Failure. Failure. But it was all I needed. I recreated the face of my enemy. I turned Durant's organization against itself... until only he remained. [ Yelling ] And then, finally, I destroyed him. - Kiss your ass good-bye!. - No!. But I chose to live on... as a creature of the shadows. As Darkman. [ Exhales ] It's the boss!. quick! -Doctor said he'd never come out of this coma. Where's Eddie?. -Yeah, I'm here, Rollo. After all this time! You wouldn't think anybody'd survive a crash like that. Roy!. Get your ass in here!. Okay, yeah! Doctor? He's coming back! [ Groaning ] [ Thunderclap ] [ Tires Screeching ] [ Machine Gun Fire ] Get on their fuckin' tail! I want my fuckin' coke! I want my fuckin' money! And I wanna kill those motherfuckers! [ Screaming ] - Go, go, go, go! - [ Tires Screeching ] [ Woman ] Yeah, yeah! Do it! Do it! [ Screaming ] [ Man ] Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go! - I'll get those fuckers with this! - Yeah! Do it! - [ Yelling ] - Oh, shit! - [Woman Screaming] - [ Laughing ] - Look out! [ Screaming ] - What?. [Sirens In Distance ] - [ Woman ] Oh, Steve. Oh, Steve! - [ Panting ] - [ Woman Weeping] Steve! Steve! - [ Spitting ] Baby! Oh, I'm hurt! I'm hurt real bad. [ Woman Screaming, Weeping ] [ Screams ] - No! - No, man! No! [ Yelling, Screaming ] [Woman Screaming] Steve! Steve! -Alone at last. - [ Spits ] - [Woman Panting] - [Man ] Fuck! Later, bitch! [Sirens Wailing] Help me! [Scream Reverberates ] Huh?. [ Police Radio, Indistinct ] [ Panting ] [ Chuckles ] [ Panting Continues ] [ Grunting, Groaning ] [ Yelling ] - What the hell are you?. - A concerned citizen. [Sirens Wailing] [ Groans ] Thanks for the donation. [Indistinct Talking] You can still hear sirens in the background as more firefighters arrive... on the scene of this bloodbath. The police will be some time yet assessing the death toll... as paramedics fight furiously to save what lives they can. Dan, you got it?. You hooked up?. Mm-hmm. I'll be ready in a second. Wow, look at this mess. What happened here?. I don't know. We'll have lots of pretty pictures. Bonnie! How's it goin'?. Cisco. Amazing reporter. Network, Stan. That's where we gotta be. No, that's where you're gonna be. [ Woman ] We have to find Stringer. I know he's around here somewhere. They just went to commercial. Can we be live when they come back?. Yeah. Absolutely. All right, let's go. You positive?. Let's do it. Tell 'em to pick up the stuff at the other end. What am I doing here?. Stringer, give me the short form. What happened?. Just your basic shit storm. We got one burned in the car, one gunshot dead up here, two others critical, and that guy's telling me the Phantom of the Opera used a manhole cover... Like a, like a Frisbee. Drugs?. Oh, yeah. Lots of drugs. Forty seconds, Jill! They used AK-47s, huh?. Come on, Jill, don't touch the evidence. Thanks, Stringer. She's a regular Sherlock Holmes. Yeah, yeah, yeah, we got some work to do. Okay, listen, after the lead-in, go to the burned car, then the fire truck, then keep it on me for the wrap. [Stan ] You got it. All ready? Mm-hmm. Here we go. Five, four, three, two-- I'm Jill Randall coming to you live for Street Copy. What cost, what wasted lives. Drugs, police believe, are responsible for a gun battle... that erupted in the uptown area tonight. Authorities are still counting the bodies from a firefight... that raged over several blocks... before ending here in a horrific crash. When will the violence stop?. When we stop the men who put drugs on the streets. When we stop the men who put guns in the hands of children. Then maybe we'll have peace. Tragic. Simply tragic. I'm Jill Randall for Street Copy-- I abhor violence. Especially when it doesn't make me money. Good night. Life in the city isn't cheap. Death is. When every 1 2-year-old punk is packin' iron, death is cheap. What does that tell you, gentlemen?. Cartoons are too violent. It tells you that I've been away too long. But now I'm back. Thank you, my dear. [ Groans ] During my absence, you gentlemen became sloppy. Oh, I don't know about that, Mr. Durant. I think we did very well. You would. We used to own the gun trade in this city. - Now we're being undercut by every nickel-and-dimer. - With all respect, Mr. Durant, you've been... out of commission for a long time. You know, I've been thinking', me and the boys, we've got some plans. Maybe you should... Let us take care of things for a while, hmm?. You wouldn't know a plan if it was pounded up your ass with a jackhammer! Oh, god! Aah. Aah! Help him. Ohh! My pills! My pills! Boss. Your medication's right over here. Get some water. [ Groaning ] Water! [ Groans ] [ Grunts ] Well. Gentlemen, we are going back into the arms business. We're what? We are taking control, top to bottom. How?. The prices are already below cost. Smart boy, Roy. We are going to eliminate the competition... by providing a better product. New guns for the new era. Where you gonna get the guns?. We are going to make them. [ Chuckles ] And for that, [ Groans ] we need a factory. Someplace with adequate floor space, convenient to shipping and distribution. A place with an extraordinary power supply, and yet away from prying eyes. In short, we need a working factory on the south side near the rail yard. Ha! Good luck. All those buildings there have been condemned for years. Oh, ye of little faith. My factory does exist. It's right there. Brinkman Electrical. I want you to buy the place. And I want to set up operations within a week. I'll get right on it. Want me to make the usual offer... boss?. We might not want to draw attention to ourselves right now. Why don't you try money instead. [ Grunts ] [ Male Computer Voice ] All clear on track 85. No oncoming trains. Access tunnel 1 8. Auxiliary tracks in use. Approaching destination. [ Computer] Good night, Dr. Westlake. Good night. [ Female Computer Voice ] Cheers, Doctor. Computer status report: lab control systems static. Hypercube processes idling at seven percent capacity. Liquid skin system cryogenic storage low. Photosynthetic digitization in ready state. ext status report in 30 minutes. Systems await your command, Doctor. [ Computer] Initiating subject photograph digitization. Digitization complete. Holographic recognition imaging. Subject mask synthesis complete. Implementing skin matrix formula number 2,9 1 7.. Estimated photosensitivity index unknown. Unknown?. No, we must beat the 99-minute barrier. [ Beeping ] [ Beeping Continues ] [ Female Computer Voice ] Photosensitivity reaction. Skin matrix dissolving at 99 minutes. Failure. Failure. Failure. Failure. Failure. No! Oh! Thank you, sir. "A Light-resistant polymer skin substitute. " Hmm. Dr. David Brinkman. Well, this is definitely what you would call low-rent. We'll have to get rid of that sign. Right. Just open the gate. Do you think the boss really wants this piece of shit?. Durant says we need power. This place has got plenty to spare. Will ya look at the size of this place?. Can I help you?. That depends. Your name Brinkman?. Yes, I'm Dr. Brinkman. This is your lucky day, Doc. I represent Inter-City Land Development. We're a group of investors financing a redevelopment project. - What's that got to do with me?. - We want your building, Doc. The people I represent... are prepared to offer one million dollars cash for this property. - Uh-- [ Chuckling ] - [Rollo Chuckling] Look, I'm sorry you wasted your time coming down here, but it's not for sale. - Now, this is a serious offer, Brinkman. I'd think about it. - Really? I'm not interested. Excuse me. I've got to get back to work. I don't think he understood a word I said. We're buying this building, Doc, and that means you're selling it. Last chance, Doc. - Look, I don't know how to make this any-- - Shh. Take the money. Go. [ Westlake ] Is there a problem? Uh... Here's my card, Doc. Keep in touch. Why don't you just go with your friends. They're not friends of mine. - Then what do you want?. - I'd like to talk to you... about your study in T-lymphoma skin cells. I read your article in the Survey of Molecular Biology. I thought it was fascinating. [ Laughs ] Thank you. Not a lot of people read that stuff. Are you a scientist?. I've done similar research based on a polymer skin substitute. Like you, though, I've had problems with disintegration in UV light. Anyway, I've put my findings on disk, and I'd be honored if you could take a look. Certainly. Excellent. We'll talk. I didn't get your name. [ Exhales ] [ Humming ] Here you go, boss. Just the way you like 'em. - [ Glass Shatters] - [ Clapping] - Good, boss. - [ Clapping Continues ] You wanted to see me, boss?. Rollo! Yes. Do join us. I understand you spoke to the owner of the factory yesterday. Uh, yeah. He ain't sellin'. - It's unfortunate Brinkman declined our offer. - Yeah. So, uh, what's the plan, boss? I had an interesting conversation with our Colombian friends today. Do you know what they told me?. Mr. Durant, I can explain-- They told me you were taking a five-percent bonus on all our drug shipments. - That was nothin', Mr. Durant. - Edward, how long was I in my coma?. and 1 6 minutes, Mr. Durant. two shipments a week, each shipment worth, say, ten million dollars on the street, minus the problems with the exchange rate. - What do you say that might add up to, Edward?. - $27,280,000... and 1 7 cents. Aah! [ Groaning ] [ Grunting ] Come on! Come on! Come on. Get in! [ Grunting ] - Wh-- No! No! - Buckle up. - Where's my fucking money?. - C-Cayman Bank of Commerce. I-I got an account there. I was gonna tell you. It was gonna be a surprise! Oh, I'm surprised. Can't you tell?. - [ Giggles ] - [Durant ] And now I have a surprise for you. [ Screaming ] [ Screaming Continues ] Always replace your divots, Rollo. Seventeen over the-- No, no, no, eighteen. Eighteen. [ Footsteps ] [ Beeping] Chow time, Doc. So, what are we having this evening?. Lobster florentine?. Beef Wellington. Perhaps grilled ahi on a bed of Belgian endive. No, your old favorite, Doc. I hate meat loaf! [Men Screaming] Dr. Hathaway, I presume. Ahh. [ Belches ] So, what am I doing here, Robert?. You didn't go to the trouble of breaking me out to feed me a home-cooked meal. Well, there aren't many scientists with your vision, your technical expertise. What you mean is, there aren't many men... who could build a hydrogen bomb in their garage. You were working on something before your untimely arrest. A man-portable, air-cooled, semi-automatic particle beam weapon. Guns for the new century. Weapons of devastating firepower. If we can build a better assault rifle, the world will beat a path to our door. - But all you lack is the technology. - And that's where you come in. Power is going to be a problem. That weapon requires a lot of energy. You let me worry about that. Are you interested?. - I still have my brainchild stored away. - Then we have a deal. I hope you saved room for dessert. [Hathaway] Ladies! Oh. You drive a hard bargain. You shouldn't have to ask! That's-- I won't have it! It's not your choice! [Door Opens ] I'm sorry. The gate was open. [ Woman ] I was just leaving. David, I'll talk to you later. Hi, I'm Laurie. Peyton. Nice to meet you, Peyton. You too. So, it's, uh... Peyton. Yeah. Was, uh, that, your, uh, girlfriend?. No, uh, sister. This is an amazing place you've built here. Yeah. It's got a lot of history. My father tried to make a go of it through the war and beyond. He was pioneering research in conventional and atomic power applications. I guess you could say he was a little bit ahead of his time. Yeah. He passed away three years ago. I think he died when they turned the lights out in this place. I'm sorry to hear that. It's okay. You know, I always knew that I would come back here. I mean, this place, it just feels like... home. You know, my father's spirit was driven by his strength. He even harnessed a power supply that was big enough to drive a small city. It inspires me to try great things. Like what?. I want to rekindle a kind of scientific renaissance. A place where scientists can come from all over the world and work... outside of the constraints of established funding. You know?. I mean, just look around this place. Just imagine... the possibilities in here. That's, uh... the dream, you know. It's important to have a dream. I'm impressed. I'm impressed with you. The work on those disks-- brilliant. Let me show you something. Come on. There was similar work to yours published a few years back. It was by a scientist named... Westlake. You know him? I was familiar with his work. I ran the formulas you used for the polymer base. I used a similar one myself a few months back. It didn't work either. But I was using negatively-charged ions. You used a silicon base?. No, no. Carbon. But last night I ran a sample set using your formulas, only I reversed the charge of the ions. And in full exposure to sunlight, this little sucker lasted 1 73 minutes. [ Both Laughing ] You did it! You beat the 99-minute barrier! - You did it. - Hey, it's only one sample. But I think together we could crack the structure for a permanently stable polymer. That is, if you'd be interested in a partnership. Oh, I'm interested. I'm very interested. Only to crack it, we're gonna need a digital spectrochronometer. One of the new 1 000 models. They're expensive. No, don't worry. Money's not a problem. - What, do you have a grant?. - No, I, uh, I get donations from the community. Partners, then?. Partners. [ Laughs ] When can we start?. [Beeping] I have to see somebody. I have an appointment. I'll talk to you soon. This is fantastic. Thank you. This is fantastic! Thank you, Dr. Brinkman! Partners, huh?. [ Laughing ] [ Beeping ] [Television, Indistinct ] Here, kitty, kitty. Come on. I have a surprise. [ Beeping Continues ] I'd like you to meet a friend of mine. - Ah, there you are! [ Laughing ] - [ Cat Yowling ] Come on. Come on. [ Woman On Television ] Thank you for that report. While there's no question as to the victim's identity, questions remain unanswered. Be careful. He bites. [ Woman ]... the criminal empire built by Robert G. Durant, who disappeared a few years ago. Latham, suspected in several gangland slayings, had emerged as a brutal lord of the underworld; tonight his reign is over. His death, police believe, may signal that there is more than one contender... to the throne left vacant by Robert Durant. - I'll continue to bring you more on this story. - No! David! Okay. The D.I.N.I. samples have stabilized. The cell membranes-- Mmm-- remain elastic. And there appears to be no breakdown... in cell structure... or activity after... Okay. Let's go for the record, baby. [ Telephone Rings ] Dr. Brinkman, I presume. - [ Chuckles ] - Aah! - No! - I believe you're acquainted... - with a former associate of mine, Rollo Latham. - Former?. Mr. Latham and I had a falling out. [ Male Computer Voice ] Good evening, Dr. Westlake. Full throttle! Come on! All you have to do... is sign. [ Panting ] I told him, I'll tell you. This property's not for sale. Rollo made it very clear that money was of no interest to you. I've asked Mr. Druganov to resume negotiations... with an incentive you'll find much more compelling. One more move, and I'll perform laser surgery on each one of you guys. - Now leave! - A regular Luke Skywalker. - Yeah?. - Whoa! [ Chuckles ] Ivan?. Please teach Dr. Brinkman some manners. - Are we all clear?. - [ Computer ] Access terranean level, tunnel B. [ Screaming ] My work! My work! What's it going to take, Dr. Brinkman?. [ Grunting, Yelling ] [ Groaning ] [ Laughing, Yelling ] - [Eddie Giggling] - [ Muttering In Russian ] [ Groans ] [Ivan Laughing] Come on! [Brinkman Groaning] - [ Screaming ] - [ Laughing ] quietly, gentlemen. This is a school night. Please! Please, no! [Ivan ] You like that! Eddie! Come here, Eddie! - [ Laughing ] - [ Ivan Speaking Russian ] - Eat! - [ Men Laughing ] [ Ivan ] Eat! Eat! David! Oh, no. David?. Durant! [ Darkman ] It can't be! He survived! Robert G. Durant! Bring the Asian's finger. It will make a nice addition to my collection. [ Cackling ] [Durant's Voice Echoing] He's a freak! He's a freak! He's a freak! He's a freak! [ Darkman ] No. No! Noooooo! [ Electricity Crackling ] Yes! Music to my ears, gentlemen. Aah! Beautiful. Beautiful. Remember, this is just the prototype. [ Grunts ] Get out of the way. - Power on. - [Electricity Humming] - Safety off. - [ Weapon Beeping] [ Electrical Cycling Accelerating ] Boss! - [ Grunts ] - Yes! - The dawning of a new day! - Right on. Shoots a little to the left. Still uses a lot of juice. Happily, we may have found the solution to our power problem. [ Beeping ] [Durant ] Mr. Druganov recently joined our organization... after an unusually varied career in the KGB. His connections have afforded us access... to some exceptional relics of the Cold War. Plutonium carbide energy cells, courtesy of space program of former Soviet Union. Each device is miniature nuclear reactor... capable of generating They were designed to be used in spy satellites... Launched over capitalist countries, but nobody's launching anymore so Ivan gets these for us wholesale. Are they stable?. These cells were manufactured by technicians in workers' paradise of Eastern Uzbekistan. Only finest Yugoslavian materials were used in their engineering. - They are reliable as your Ford Pinto. - [ Chuckles ] How long might it take you to... adapt these to your rifle?. End of the week okay?. Oh. Excellent! [ Chuckling ] Get started. Inter-City Land Development? Hmm. Huh. David. Hmm. What are you doing here? Laurie. I said, what are you doing here?. Laurie, it's me, Peyton. Remember?. - I was working on a project with your brother. - The project's over. - Laurie, I'm so sorry about David. - Get out, okay?. Get out! Please, just go. Oh. [Female Computer Voice ] Automatic synthetic skin test. skin formula experiment number 4,803. Okay, Dr. Westlake. Back to square one. [ Computer Continues, Indistinct ] Why do you do it?. Why do you get involved with these people?. Why do you do this?. [ Sighs ] The work on those disks-- brilliant. But I think together we could crack the structure for a permanently stable polymer. That is, if youd be interested in a partnership. [ Westlake ] Oh, I'm interested. I'm very interested. Partners, then?. Partners. [ David] I mean, just look around this place. Imagine... the possibilities. That's, uh, the dream. No! [ Crashing ] Durant. Durant. [ Dan ] Jill, it's a great story. Yeah, it's good. Thank you, Lord. Oh! Whoo! [ Laughs ] Oh. Okay. Outta here. Oh. So, you comin'?. Yeah. I'm gonna check this one more time. Go ahead. I'll see you in the morning. Jill. Go home. Tell Patty I said hi. You're sure?. Absolutely. Good work. [ Videotape Playing, Indistinct ] 'Night, Bob. David. That's Dan. Dan. Jill, did you get my memo?. The one about parking in your space?. [ Chuckles ] No, the one cancelling the retrospective on Rollo Latham. He's a crime lord, Bob. He's... dead, Jill. Besides, this is Street Copy. Oh. It's not our kind of news. It's about sensationalism. It's about ratings. Now, you had an assignment. How come you're not on it?. Well, for starters, it's fundamentally asinine. It's the '90s,Jill. Fake orgasms-- Are they better? Women want to know. People want to watch. - Jill, you're not working for the networks. - No, not yet. I am tired of you ignoring your assignments. - I suggest you drop the 'tude. - Bob, I'm not doing a story... on fake orgasms. I am the one who decides what the viewers want to see, not you. Oh. Fine. Let's make this simple. - Shape up, or you're gone. - Yeah. Yeah. [ Videotape Rewinding] Bullshit. [ Westlake ] Television really is going to hell. Who the hell are you? I saw your broadcast on Robert G. Durant and Rollo Latham. You're very good. Yeah. What do you want?. There was a murder on the east side a couple of nights ago. - A man named Dr. Brinkman was beaten to death. - It's a violent world. Would you be interested if I told you I had reason to believe Durant was involved?. I'd be interested if you could prove Durant's alive. Brinkman had a finger missing. This is Durant's signature. He cuts fingers off his victims with a cigar cutter. Just because there's a finger missing doesn't prove anything. The killer could be a lunatic with a finger fetish. No. I don't think so. Mmm?. Brinkman's building was purchased by a company called Inter-City Land Development. I'd like you to find out who owns it. - How do I get in touch with you?. - I'll contact you. You'd better not be wasting my time. Brinkman. Mr. Durant. Mr. Perkins. Thank you for coming. It's an unusual pleasure to meet an American like yourself. Uh-huh. Let me tell you something, Durant. This country is going to hell. The police don't have the weapons to stop it, the courts don't have the will, and the people-- Damn, Durant, the people are bereft... of the fundamental guts necessary to take back our streets. Precisely. And what is needed to take back those streets is firepower. New weapons for a new age. This is the prototype of a gun we like to call "The Vigilante." In one fell swoop, this weapon makes obsolete the guns of every criminal in this city. You know, Durant, I don't much like science fiction. This isn't science fiction, Mr. Perkins! This, sir, is science "fact"-ion. This rifle is a prototype. The production model will be powered by plutonium carbide batteries. Well, now. Uh, just what is the range on this here thing, huh?. Oh, it will track and disintegrate moving targets up to three kilometers. Its range against stationary objects is limited only... by the... curvature of the Earth. Shit. With this gun, we could save this nation from itself. This is not recommended for indoor use. Just what is the price tag on one of these puppies, Durant?. They are five million dollars each. Batteries not included. - The initial production run will be 20 rifles. - When can I have 'em?. End of the week. Outstanding. It's been a pleasure doing business with you, Durant. You know, I always say a man who can 't love his own country... can't love a damn thing. - [ Chuckles ] - Thank you, Mr. Perkins. You are a patriot, sir. I'm just a man following my own beliefs. There you go. [ Whitey] Gentlemen. Robert, do you think it's a good idea... to sell to someone who wants to fight crime?. Hmm. Marvelous, isn't it?. As soon as he gets his hands on those guns, Mr. Perkins and his neanderthal nazis... will attack every criminal organization in the city. - Where does that leave us, boss?. - Without competition, Edward. In his patriotic zeal, Mr. Perkins will level the playing field for us. Besides, in a couple of weeks, he'll be out of batteries. Then we can use the second batch of rifles to consolidate... our interests in drugs, gambling, not to mention sales to our friends abroad. The resurgent Durant organization... will have a complete, uncontested monopoly... over every criminal enterprise in this city. Robert, I have to hand it to you. You're a genius. I've always thought so. [ Man ] Laurie, if there's anything we can do, please let us know. That's very kind. That was beautiful, Father. Take care. Okay. Laurie. Thank you, Gene. Hi, Laurie. Hi. I'm sorry about your brother. Thank you. I want to apologize for the other day. No, no. I understand. I'm all alone now. I wish I could make some sense out of this. You know?. I'm sorry. Did you know my brother very well?. I was beginning to, yeah. [Eddie ] Miss Brinkman? Good-bye, Peyton. I want to thank you for coming. Really. Good-bye. It was kind of you to send a car. It was the least we could do. Um-- [ Clears Throat ] I hope you know that we share in your loss. Thank you. Your firm's been very kind. Then we'll be seeing you at the signing?. All right. Thank you. I think she really digs me, man. [Shutter Clicks] You take a look in the mirror lately?. [ Click] She does. [ Click] [Engine Starts] [Limousine Pulls Away] You're late. Your directions stink. I found out who owns Inter-City Land Development: the late Rollo Latham was the C.E.O. The original articles of incorporation were signed by Robert G. Durant. I knew it. Durant wanted to buy the Brinkman property. When David wouldn't sell, he killed him. Wait a minute. We don't know who killed anybody. Just because Durant established Inter-City Land Development doesn't prove he's still alive. For all we know, he could be water skiing with Jimmy Hoffa in the Bahamas. Maybe Durant's involved, maybe he isn't. But our working relationship isn't going further until I know who I'm dealing with. My name is not important. I protect my sources. I'm sure you do, Miss Randall. But I'd like to remain anonymous. I'll call you if I learn anything. Shit. [Announcer] Okay, welcome to For Your Eyes Only. [ Techno ] Let's hear it... for Rhonda! That's right, at For Your Eyes Only, only the finest girls in town. Guys, come on, table dance. [ Continues ] Well, hello. Hello. I'm looking for someone that works here; her name is Laurie. She's upstairs. What do you need her for when you can play with me?. I don't think so. Oh. Sometimes I play rough. Oh, hmm. Hi. Laurie! What are you doing here?. Is there someplace we can talk?. What's this about, Peyton?. Tell me about those men with you at the funeral. They're from Inter-City Land Development. They're buying David's building from me. That whole corporation is a front. - They work for a man named Durant. - Durant?. No, I don't know anyone named Durant. I do. And I'm here to tell you that Durant had your brother killed. No, the police said it was an act of random violence. Laurie, Durant wanted David's building. When David wouldn't sell it to him, Durant had him killed. Do you have any proof of this?. These men have been very good to me. They helped me with David's funeral. - They're offering a million dollars for the building. - A million dollars?. Is that what this is about?. They killed David! They tortured him! - Laurie, is everything okay?. - It's fine, Bubba. Thanks. Okay. Look, I mean, I don't even know you. I loved my brother. When David left me the building, he gave me a way out of this life. I can go back to school. I can make a difference with myself because of David. -It's all he ever wanted for me. -It's blood money, Laurie. Well, I'm sorry, Peyton, I'm signing the papers tomorrow. Do you have any idea how many post office boxes there are in this town?. I had a cop friend of mine run the fingerprints you left at the restaurant. You don't have any fingerprints. Do you... Dr. Westlake?. They buried a box full of ashes, but Peyton Westlake didn't die in that fire, did he? - Most of him died. - Not many people rise from the dead. You're news. Durant's news. I'm a reporter. That's all this is for you, just another story. -It's the truth; it's what I do. What is it for you, revenge?. -Revenge?. That man destroyed my life! He took my face, my hands! He took my life! I want to see Durant dead. He tortured and murdered David Brinkman. He will kill again, and he will keep on killing until someone stops him. And that someone is going to be me. Westlake, my sources tell me... there's been shipments of plutonium brought into the city. Last week, Alfred Hathaway, a weapons genius, was broken out of a looney bin. If he's working with Durant, this could be huge. If I expose Durant on the air, his plans are finished. No! That'll only drive Durant underground. The way to stop him is from the inside. I'm going public tonight. You want Durant; I want the story. It's big. - Stay out of it, Jill. - When I break this, Durant's going down. - Five seconds, four, three-- - Camera one. Good evening, for Street Copy, I'm Jill Randall. That's it, Jill. What is it about today's relationships? What is it that keeps the magic? But first, the death last week of crime lord Rollo Latham cast an unwelcome light on the past. [Jill On TV] The link between a big city development corporation... and the criminal empire of Robert G. Durant... may be behind Latham 's spectacular and untimely end. Here you go, boss. This picture, taken by our Street Copy investigative team, clearly shows Robert G. Durant, Long-missing and thought dead by city police. What an unflattering photograph. What is he up to? Why has the reemergence of one of this country's most notorious criminals been kept a secret?. I'll have more for you tomorrow as I continue our series, "The Fall of a Kingpin. " For Street Copy, I'm Jill Randall. Good night. I'm gonna kill her! Putz. Jill! That pretty face has just talked you out of a job, honey. Bob! Jill! The switchboard is going nuts! Sir, let me explain. They love it! We've had more calls than when we ran the Fergie pictures. You are a genius. Super job! And you, Bob, keep it up, buddy! Good stuff! Yes! You're an asshole. [ Laughing ] Jill, baby, I loved it. The best work youve ever done! - Caught my broadcast?. - It was a big mistake. - Hmm, it was news. - Durant will notice. A lot of people will notice, hopefully the networks. We both want to stop him. Publicity is one thing Durant doesn't want. Trust me on this. Reporter's instincts. I'm right, I think. Just be careful, okay?. Uh-huh. Peyton, I like this look. [ Chuckles ] Jill! [ Tires Screeching] [ Computer Beeping ] Okay, Eddie, let's see. [Female Computer Voice ] Initiating subject photograph digitization. Digitization completed. [ Darkman ] Process voice. [ Eddie's Voice ] I think she really digs me, man. I think she really digs me, man. I think she really digs me, man. I think she really digs me. I think she really digs me, man. I think she really digs me, man. I think she really digs me, man. No, no, come on! I think she really digs me, man. I think she really digs me, man. Yes, yes. [ Man ] Hey, Bob, wait up! [ Man ] Taxi! [ Toilet Flushing ] [ Humming ] You forgot to zip your fly, Eddie. Oh. Thanks, Bud. Uh! [ Chokes ] You son of a bitch! You killed David, you killed him! [ Toilet Flushing ] Enjoy your nap. Okay, yes, thank you. Late again, Eddie?. Where the hell have you been? In the bathroom. We've got a meeting. Come on, before he gives you a golf lesson. Eddie, you look like shit. I do?. Sit down, wedge head. Don't tell me you're back with that bitch Margie again?. That chick messes with your mind, man. [ Yelling ] - I'll kill you! - Eddie! - Westlake! - [ Yelling ] [ Bangs On Table ] Eddie! Hello! Uh, sorry. [ Clears Throat ] Have you been drinking again? Never mind. Whatever your problem is, I suggest you keep it at home. - Do you understand? - Totally, boss. [ Sighs ] The equipment, Eddie! Um... It's, uh, movin' right on schedule, boss. - It'll be ready. - Make sure that it is. [Knocking On Door] Excuse me, sir. Miss Brinkman is here to sign the papers. Ah, goody. Miss Brinkman, I believe you've already met Mr. Scholley. It's a pleasure to meet you. I'm Robert G. Durant. I'm president of Inter-City Land Development's parent company. - Durant?. - Please call me Robert. Do sit down. As you can see, the check is already prepared. All we need is your signature on these X's, then the check is yours and the building is ours. [ Chuckling ] Something the matter, Miss Brinkman?. I can't-- I can't sell you the building. Is it the price?. No. Excuse me, I-- Excuse me-- [ Sighs ] What is it with these Brinkmans?. Eddie, take Roy with you and bring her back. She will sign. [ Woman ] Hold the elevator, please? Thank you. What are you doing?. Open the door! She's gonna-- Eddie! Taxi! Laurie! You have to get away from here. Durant's gonna have you killed. What's he doing?. Shit! Eddie, you moron, open the door! I thought you were working for him! I am-- I'm not. It's complicated. You gotta get out of here now! What the hell is your problem?. Some freak duked me in the washroom. Who?. What?. Hey, that's me. That's him?. It can't be! Why are you helping me?. It's a long story. Get away from here. Go as far and as fast as you can. - [Eddie/Darkman ] Go! - [Roy] Hey, Eddie! Hey, Eddie! [Roy] Hey, Whitey! Whitey, open the door! [ Eddie/Darkman ] Go, go! Westlake! Get the girl! Go! Move it! [ Tires Screeching, Horns Honking ] - Hurry! - [ Man ] Watch it, asshole! Whoa! [ Grunting ] [ Groaning ] Hold it! - Let's go. Let's move! - C'mon, you guys! [Screaming] [ Tires Screeching] [ Man ] Hey, watch it, buddy! [ Crowd Screaming] - Laurie! - Shit. - Let's go! Come on! - I'm doing the best I can. Laurie, stop! Laurie! Laurie! Laurie! - Laurie! - Wait, stop! We have to pick up that man. Which one, lady?. This one, this man! Tell him to stop the car! Laurie, Laurie! Thanks for stopping. Just isn't your day, is it, sweetheart?. - [ Yells ] - Drive, gramps. - Laurie! - No! Laurie, d-don't! [ Whitey] You want her, come and get her. Come on. No! [Laurie ] Don't! Let go! No! It's all mine now. I know Westlake. That cockroach will be here. It's just a matter of time. He knows we have the girl, he will try to save her, and when he does, gentlemen, that will be my lucky day. He could look like anybody. He could look like me. He could look like... any one of you. Jeez, boss, it's me! Until Westlake is safely in my hands, everyone is suspect. [ Train Whistle Blowing] It's impossible working in this noise and dust. Doctor?. Yes, it is me, Robert. Are you sure?. Yes, I'm sure. Relax. You're getting paranoid. Paranoia is total awareness. No one can relax until Westlake is toast. Edward, my pills. Ivan, are you making sure they're not dawdling on the modifications to my car?. Yes, sir. They called. I will pick it up myself. Good. What's that?. [ Impersonating Ivan ] Yes, sir. They called. I will pick it up myself. [Durant ] The batteries will be ready in time? Yes, yes, yes! I'm about to load the first one-- Be careful! Would you be careful?. Put that down! I bypassed the pressurized tritium in the outer chambers. [Durant ] I don't need the details. Will they work? Absolutely, positively. [ Ivan ] Whitey! Whitey! [ Yelling ] Of course it's important... not to cross-connect the terminals of the battery! I think we've all learned a valuable safety tip here. Carry on, Doctor. I'm going downstairs to check on our guest. Ivan?. Miss Brinkman, you look comfy. This is the time when I'd normally ask whether youd reconsidered our offer. You killed David. I thought you might still be upset about that. Not that it really matters. I've moved on to Plan B. Ivan, tell our lucky prize winner where she's going. To our sod farm... in Saskatchewan. I think youll find it a peaceful, out-of-the-way little spot... where your only visitor might be an occasional moose... who decides to decorate your final resting place with a dropping. Before I ship you out, I'm going to use you... to destroy that miserable bug, Peyton Westlake. Peyton?. For some reason he cares about you. I'm going to use you to lure him into the open, then I'm going to kill you both. Thought you'd like to know. Just for record... I would have taken money. [ Female Computer Voice ] Biochemical synthesis complete. Globular substance matrices encapsulated. Let's see, um-- Let's see what happens when this hits your stomach, Mr. Durant. Danger. Toxicity sensors indicate... Okay. substance ingestion fatal. Hmm. [ Chuckling ] Substance ingestion fatal. [ Chuckling Continues ] Durant, take two of these and call me in the morning. [ Laughing ] [Laugh Echoing] [Man On Radio ] Colorado 5., San Francisco 1. Giants won 15. out of their last 20. [Power Ratchet Noise ] Is anyone here?. I'm over here working. What do you want? I've come for Mr. Durant's car. What do you think, genius, does it look ready yet? You called, told us to pick it up. I didn't call anybody. Come back in an hour. Someone called. I am here. I will take car now! Foreigners. - Typical American workers! - Surprise. No wonder you lost the Cold War. [ Yelling In Russian ] Always pay attention to the instructions. Look what happened to Whitey. [ Car Horn Honking] [Honking Continues ] All right, all right. Roy, get the doors. Move it! What took you so long?. Some windows failed my test. So I made him do it over. The windows are acceptable. What about the rest of the car?. Two inches of Kevlar armor were installed in doors, roof and hood. Tires are puncture-proof. And vehicle is resistant to all known NATO and Soviet anti-tank weapons. And... it has 1 0 CD player in trunk. - Hmm! - So much for Westlake. The one place I was vulnerable is now a fortress. Boss. Mr. Perkins, right on time. I am always on time, Durant. That's why I'm rich. You have my merchandise. Awaiting your inspection. One hundred million, cash on the barrel. - Smells wonderful, doesn't it?. - [Perkins Laughing] My rifles, Durant. Ah, Dr. Hathaway. Would you do the honors?. [Hathaway] Now pay attention, Mr. Perkins! You simply point and shoot! [ Gun Beeping ] - Man! - [Hathaway] Hallelujah! Glory, glory, hallelujah  Glory, glory, hallelujah  Glory, glory, hallelujah  [Hathaway Continues ] You have revolutionized the right to bear arms. In this case, the far right to bear arms. [ Laughing] This calls for a celebration. [ Laughing ] Damn, Durant, that is one fine weapon. Thank you, sir. The boys and I love a big noise, don't we?. We sure do, sir. Let's drink to the green. Yes. Mmm. This gun of yours seems to work well on inanimate objects. But how does it work on people? Good question. Why don't we invite Miss Brinkman to join us. I will get her. No, Roy can get her. [ Groaning ] My pills. Right here, Mr. Durant. This will save us the cost of mailing her to Saskatoon. Let me go! Thank you for volunteering, Miss Brinkman. Ivan, disintegrate the girl, won't you?. [ Yells In Pain ] Robert?. What's the matter?. He's having reaction to his medication! Take a deep breath. Let's get him to a hospital. [ Groaning ] You're a doctor, do something! I'm not that kind of a doctor. Open doors, quickly! Yes! Easy. One of us is not who he pretends to be. Ivan never carries my pills, Westlake. [ Speaking Russian ] Only I am allowed to wear my face! [Laurie Gasps] You are so predictable. I knew you'd come after me. All I had to do was dangle the right bait in front of whats left of your nose. Cuff him and bring him. Isn't this delightful?. Two of my favorite people about to sacrifice themselves to the greater good. You're a lovely couple, but now it's time to play, "You Bet Your Life." I would offer some traditional parting gifts, but we're fresh out of cigarettes and blindfolds. Dosvidanio. Bring me one of the girl's fingers and all ten of Westlake's. I want to see the freak suffer. [ Gun Beeping] [ Laughing Maniacally ] He's a freak! [ Echoing ] David. No! Peyton?. - Peyton?. - Durant! Peyton, please. No, no. No! [ Yelling ] [Durant ] Jesus! Get off me, you idiot! [ All Grunting ] [Laurie ] Peyton! Laurie, get down! Get him! [Laurie Grunting] Are you okay?. I want you to get out of here now. Yeah. Grab those guns and that money and let's blow this pop stand! It was you who helped me with the cab, wasn't it?. Yeah. You gotta go now, Laurie. No! Trust me, go now! Move! Where the hell are you going?. - Perkins, you leave my babies! - They're my babies now, you commie son of a bitch! Nazi bastard! Nobody walks away from a deal with Robert G. Durant. Where are you, you spooky son of a bitch?. [Durant ] Where is he? - Come out, come out, wherever you are! - Boss, look! You want me?. Come and get me! He's a fucking ghost, man! Let's make sure of that, shall we?. Well?. Eddie, come on! Wait up! Look somewhere else. You're not gonna find him behind me. Where are you, you freak?. - How 'bout a nightmare? - [ Gasps ] [ Roy] I got him! Eddie! Eddie, I got the bastard! [ Ivan ] You got him? Hold the door! You got him. Good going, Roy! Roy?. Uh-oh. Eddie? - You killed my friends. - [ Nervous Laugh ] I'm sorry. - Forgive me?. - Apology accepted. [ Screaming ] [ Thud] You're next, Durant. [Laughing] Westlake! You're dead! You're dead, you're dead! [ Gunshots ] I told you, it's my face! Gentlemen, cease and desist or I'll fry you both. Now come down here. What I have here is a 50-50 proposition. How to tell?. The real Ivan stepped on a mine in Afghanistan. He has an artificial hip. Mr. Durant, that's me. I'm Ivan. I have artificial hip. Mr. Durant, it's me. I'm Ivan. Shoot him. He's Westlake. Shoot him! He's Westlake! I'm Ivan! I have artificial hip! I'm Ivan! Mr. Durant, shoot him. Believe me! I have artificial hip. It's me. I'm Ivan! - Shoot him. He's Westlake. - No, Mr. Durant-- [Durant ] Hip, hip, hooray. Well, I guess that narrows down my choices, doesn't it, Westlake? Aren't you the pretty one?. I can't tell you what an epic pain in the ass you've been. But nothing lasts forever, pizza face. [ Gun Beeping ] Durant! Laurie. Hmm. A baby doll with a big gun. This must be one of Barbie's new spring accessories. Come to save Prince Charming?. Take a good look. - Put the gun down, you ridiculous bitch. - This is for David. I got ya, you bastard! You'll pay for what you've done! [ Both Yelling ] [ Coughing ] Game is over, Westlake! - [ Laughing ] - [ Gun Clicks ] Batteries not included. [ Laughing ] [ Yelling ] You! [ Yells ] [ Coughing ] Come here, come here! Westlake, stay wherever the hell you are... or youll be wearing her last thought. Get in! [ Screams ] - [ Machine Beeping ] - Hey! Run, Laurie, get away from the car! - Westlake! - [ Laughing ] Ohh! [ Electronic Squeaking ] [ Squeaking Continues ] [Darkman ] Be careful now, he bites. You son of a bitch! This time, it's forever. David's dreams died with him. Durant stole mine. Protect your dreams, Laurie. Peyton. Thank you, Peyton. [ Woman On TV] We'll be bringing you more details as they become available. However, on a sadder note, today, former anchor Jill Randall was buried. Known as one of television's most aggressive reporters, Randall never compromised her integrity. In fact, the very night she was killed, she broke a major story-- that of the return to power of crime boss Robert G. Durant. Police sources are saying Durant may have been responsible... for the car bomb that took Randall's life. Whatever the facts, let it be said that Jill Randall died as she lived-- in relentless pursuit of the truth. [ Darkman ] Vengeance has many casualties: the guilty and the innocent. My salvation was buried with those who would rescue me from revenge. And so, I continue to face the darkness... alone.
