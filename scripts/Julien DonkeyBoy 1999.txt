I think there's another one in there. Is there 12 turtles in that pond? Yeah. There's 11 turtles in that pond, two turtles on the rock. Yeah, I got a turtle. Where are the turtles? - I want a turtle for Daddy. - Hey, wait. Can't I get a turtle for Daddy? No, you can't get one. Almighty God, see now your faithful servant... as he lies in great weakness... and bless him with everlasting life... in the name of your Son, have mercy on him. Lamb of God, you take away our sins. Have mercy on him. Lamb of God, you take away our sins. Lamb of God, you take away our sins. Lamb of God, you take away our sins... Have mercy on us. Stop wrestling. Kiss, kiss. Kiss Mommy. Kiss, kiss Mommy. I love Punky. Nice baby. I love Punky. Mommy says Punky nice baby. Yes. You love Mommy? It's the end of wrestling. Back together. Back together again. No--! That's right. That's right... Hail, Lord Julien! Hail, Lord Julien! He made all the people bow down before him... Julien, Lord! Julien, Lord! Frere Jacques, Frere Jacques, Mommy too, Mommy too, Ding-a-long-a-lula, ding-a-long-a-lula, I'll have you, I'll be you. Frere Jacques, Frere Jacques, Mommy too, Mommy too, Where are all the monkeys? Where are all the monkeys? In the zoo. That's what I want to know. That's what I want to know. That's what I want to know. That's what I want to know. That's what I want to know. That's what I want to know. That's what I want to know. That's what I want to know. Take your teeth out. Sorry, Chris. You don't want 'em to rust or something. - I'm sorry. - That's how you rot your teeth. Chris got me my, uh-- Chris got me fronts for my birthday. - They're nice, right? - Excellent. I'm gonna let 'em rinse. You should rinse them in fresh water. I only rinse them in this juice. This looks like a state dinner. When the queen was in Russia, and there was this president and his name was Brezhnev, and he had these false teeth. And during the state dinner, he would take out his false teeth and clean it with a fork. After he ate? I gotta do that as well. - Tell her to sit straight. - Yeah. No, she should sit straight. Is that right? I see. Tell her. You eat good? You like it? Yes. - She should sit straight. - Yeah. - Make her sit straight. - Sit straight, Pearl. She listens to you. - Papa? - Yes. Am I sitting straight? Yes, you are. But look at your brother. He thinks he's a wrestler. Look at the guy. It doesn't make sense to me. "Warning... do not take product if you are hypersensitive." Hypersensitive... Am I hypersensitive? Oh, my God. I didn't hit right. Am I hypersensitive? Am I persistent? Damn it. Natural high... like in the mountains, high up. Where are you, Mount Everest? Give me some Everest. I started something like this in the aftermath of the Spanish conquest of Peru. There was a lot of infighting. They formed parties, and there was this unbelievable amount of greed among the Spanish. And there was on one side, Pizzaro and his brothers... And on the other side, there was Almagro... And he was one of the principal leaders, and boy, the guy really looked so ugly, they sent a delegation to the Spanish king and Almagro looked so gross and ugly, they couldn't even send him out there. And there's this wonderful story about this old Spanish nobleman who was well into his 70s, who's been involved in campaigns back in Europe, and then the conquest of Mexico, conquest of Peru. He was white-haired, and in all this fighting, he was on one side, I think sticking to Pizzaro's side, and all of a sudden he rides into an ambush of his enemies, and he rides on his horse and they point their muskets at him and they were just about to shoot him... and he knows he's gonna be dead in a minute... and he just defiantly sings a song against them. And what he sings is, "Little mother, two by two, wafts the wind on my hair." I truly like that. - What are they doing? - I don't know. Come here. Come here. See, from here I can see all the way across the whole New York City, almost across to Los Angeles. It's a big town, baby! I can see practically from here to the other side of America. I can see right over to the west coast. I can see right over from the east coast to the west coast. Oh, man! Thanks, man, for telling me. There's no paper in this thing. No, you've got paper. It's in the plastic bottom. It's full. It's full. - That sounded like it's moving. - I'm trying to make it move. I think we need that guy from the office. You'd better wash your hands. You'd better be wearing shoes. I'm wearing shoes, let me tell you. You can't wear these in here. - What size? - Huh? - What size? - Uh, seven. It's a heavy one. Can you hold it? You've got a heavy one. This one's lighter. You got it! You got it! Get back from the line. Back from the line, man. You cheated. You cheated already! Behind the line. - Go for it. - Can I have some respect, my man? Yeah! Yeah! That's it. Good boy. Don't scream. I don't want you to scream. This is it. Come on, keep still. Don't shift around. Come on. Be a man. Be a man and quit that moody brooding. - Quit that. - It's too cold. - Come over here. - Stop! Stop it. Dad! Come on, be a man. It might even seep through your skin, and you'll put on some weight. Shut up. Come on, you don't talk like this. - Shut up. - You don't talk like this. Just be a man. Go down-- squat down. Here. Okay, come here. Come here. I don't want this escaping. Just-- all this moody brooding, I just don't like that. Down, down. Raise your arm. Come closer to me, and don't be a coward. I don't want a coward in the family. Come here. - You want me to win? - Yes, I want you to win. And don't be a coward. Don't be a-- My son is not gonna be a coward. Stop it! Stop! That is gonna put some weight on you. Stop that shivering. I don't want you to shiver like that. Don't shiver. You're a man. Okay? Don't shiver like that. You're gonna be a winner. Just don't shiver. A winner doesn't shiver. Fuck! I can't ever fucking win! I'm gonna be a winner! I'm gonna fucking be a winner! I'm tired of fucking losing. Lamb of God... You take away the sins of the world, Have mercy on us. Lamb of God... You take away the sins of the world, Have mercy on us. Lamb of God... You take away the sins of the world, Grant us peace. Lean on Jesus, Lean on Jesus, Leaning on the everlasting love. Leaning on the everlasting love. That's cute. That's too dirty. How much are the onesies? - Two for a dollar. - Two for a dollar. I'm looking for more newborn stuff. - Did you look on the table? - There's bigger-- There's no real infant clothes on the table. It's mostly in boxes. I don't know what I'm gonna have, so I have to get, you know, both. I think it might be a boy, though. - First one? - I think it might be a boy. - First one? - Yeah. You'll be blessed, then. I might have seen a teeny weenie on the sonogram. Yeah, well, that means you're blessed. - First baby. - My first baby. They say your womb is blessed when you have a boy first. - Really? - Yeah. That's kind of sexist, don't you think? I don't know. They say, "First a boy, second a girl." The girls come in after the boys, you know that. Do you have 25c? No, I don't. I'm sorry. - Here you go. Good luck. - Thank you. Thank you very much. How are you doing? So now I'm gonna do an internal on you, okay? Okay. You're gonna feel some jelly. It's a little cold. Just try to relax. You'll feel my fingers, okay? - Are you all right? - Mm-hmm. Okay, everything feels good... Getting big. Head is down. Okay. Good. All right, you can put your legs together. - Who's the father? - Father? Why is the wind blind? The wind is blind. The wind's actually blind. 'Cause... 'cause the wind's a breeze. The breeze's a zephyr. The zephyr's a yarn, a yarn is a tale. I can't get over it. I can't get over it. I can't get-- I can't get over it. You know what I mean? I like hers as well. I like hers as well. LAPD, NYPD, NYPD... If you make the hill go downhill, it's gonna be a lot easier. You make it go downhill. It's gonna be much easier. The hill's going up. Mostly the hill goes up. You get a hill that goes downhill, gonna be much, much easier. All the way, Hosanna Bay... Excuse me? Excuse me? Do you know my family tree? Is my family tree this tree, or that tree? - I don't know. - I had a family in my tree-- I got one-- to the other tree. It's hard to tell. It's hard to tell. One way you are, the other way you are. The only way is the NYPD. Don't want to argue with the NYPD. LAPD, NYPD. I love the NYPD. My friends and my brother. My friends and my brother. You do not know what you are asking. Can you drink of the cup I am to drink of? Jesus... then said... 'You know how those who exercise authority--'" God is looking on me with disgust. Jesus has been seeing me. He thinks that I should not be... a member of the church community any longer, and I just feel very difficult. But those sentiments aren't from God, nor from Christ. And it flies in the face of all that we've been taught about God and the ministry of God and Jesus. The Father is compassionate, and His rain falls upon the just and the unjust. His sun shines upon the good and the wicked, because that's how He is. God is good, and God is love. There's no room in God for looking upon a child of His with disgust, or wanting to cast him out from the body of Christ or something like that. So these are thoughts that we can impose on ourselves, or actually the power of darkness can, as it were, whisper them in our ear. But I really have to say to you that they're not from God. Have you ever done counseling with anybody, or therapy with anybody? Or psychotherapy? No, I haven't. We have a counseling center I'll give you that, all right? I give that to you because there are names and phone numbers there. They can be helpful for a phone conversation, or just to come in one time and have a talk, you know, this kind of thing. But there's no reason for a young man like yourself to think that being either anxious or stressful is an untreatable situation. - Thank you very much. - All right. I'll give you a blessing before you go. - All right? - Thank you, Father. - Very good. - Thank you very much. Sometimes I get sinful thoughts. My mom told me when I was six years old, that all I have to do is grab the energy. I don't have the strength. I don't have the body. I have to have the energy. I grab the stake, and that's it. - Look at her. - She's got the energy. Yeah, yeah, but it's backwards. Is it a Rittberger? I don't know what it is. Who cares what it is? Look at her do that. See? - That is not gonna be an ace. - Wanna bet? There it is again. You're are cheating. You are cheating all the time. - What? - You're cheating all the time. What? Cards up my sleeve? I don't think so. You're hiding the aces somewhere. I wouldn't say up your sleeves. No sleeves. See? No sleeves. But the aces are there. It's true. I'll tell you what, it's as simple as that... When you're born different, stuff happens. Some stuff's good, some stuff's bad. For me, it worked out. Not an ace again. There won't be an ace again. Sure you don't want to bet any money on this? There it is again. Anything's possible. It's magic. It's these magic toes. She's got magic toes, too, but hers are in skates. How do you do that? I told you, I learned it as a kid. It was my equalizer. If you're born without arms, You learn to use your feet. That's the physical part. The rest, that's where you learn. It's the attitude. Look, she's got attitude, too. You come over here and pout about your world, and I'm telling you, you have to adopt a positive attitude. It's not like those people on TV that sell you stuff, it's real life. It's like the ace that keeps coming up. We're not on TV, we're real life. Grab it! Grab it and shut up! Top one? The top one? It could be any one. It could be in the middle. It could be anywhere. It's on top. There it is again. Attitude. Positive thinking-- I know it sounds like crap, but it works for me. - You're a cheater. - You're my friend. I don't do to hurt you, I do it to show you a lesson, to help you learn, buddy. Come on, Chris. Why don't you take this dress? What you want me to do with it? - It belonged to your mom. - Yeah? She wore it when we got married. Why don't you put it on? It's very nice. You're the only one who looks like your mother. Show me the other one. It's a summer dress. Just put it on, Chris. Just put it on... and dance with me. No. Since your mother left, I've never danced. I'm gonna give you $10. No. Come on. That's a lot of money. As much as a guy earns in Bangladesh for a whole month. Working in the field, he earns that much. It's a lot of money. A whole family lives on that. Come on, Chris. Hey! Captured! Stop! Stay! Stop! Captured! Stop moving! Shut up! It wasn't me. You're a dead man, sonny. Don't ever come back. Don't ever come back. Like in 1980, when you come back. You ate like a cancer. You fucking-- you killed the Jews, you killed the hippies. You killed all the mother's titties. You're a fucking cancer. You come back in the 1980s dressed as a sheriff. You're here in my bedroom! Motherfuckin' bedroom wall! What you doing? What you doing? Answer me! Answer me! Answer! Answer! Answer! Don't you move! Don't you move! Sit down have a cup of tea. I'm only joking. Come on in. Meet my friends. Hey, this is Julien. King Julien. Hey, Julien. How are you doing, King Julien? Hey, my good friend, how are ya doing? This is Adolf. Adolf. He ate my mother's titties, but hey, he's a friend. He's a friend. He's a good friend of the family. He ate my mother's titties. Come in. Come in, Adolf. Julien? King Julien? Yes, sir. What is it you want with me? I want you to make this man a guest in your own home, and make him feel like he can use a place-- and don't feed him to Mommy. Don't feed him to grandmother. Don't feed him to Joyce. Okay. I promise. Okay. So, Adolf, sit down. Now, one of the things we want to get clear in here is, at which point did you come into the Bible, and at which point did you leave? Because in the New Testament, it says that you came into the Bible and met with some of the disciples at just before the Feast of Steven. And it stated that you-- you took-- you turned your left cheek to one of the disciples and said, "Never hit me on my left side, because if you hit me on my left side, it hurts." Anyway, that's all I wanted to ask. Anyway, while I make your acquaintance, I'd just like to point out a few things. When you want to come in this house, you've got to-- you've got to-- you've got to stay with me at all times, and not upset anyone else in my family, because they don't know that I consort with known Nazis. That's all. It's my only condition, so be at peace. Another hard day in the jungle. Another hard day at the zoo. Another hard day at the jungle. Another hard day at the zoo. Punky. Punky. Come on. Come on, hurry up. Come on, angel. Come on. Go down. Go down. Go down. You don't come? Okay, bye bye. Come on. Come on. Here. Come on, Punky. Here! Punky! Punky! Okay, bye bye. Come on! Come on. Come on this time. Come on. Hurry up. Come on. Come on! Right away! Stupid fucking trash can. I'll fucking-- Number one-- I don't want all this plastic in my garden. Do you feel like a winner? Plastic, plastic, plastic. I was just playing. Yeah, but that's not an opponent. You've got to be tougher. Real tough. You've got to out-gut them, out-tough them, outwrestle them. Outplastic them. You should be a winner. There's no winner around in the house. I am a winner. I am a winner! Here is the subject of the essay. Make sure you've marked... Dance for me! Yeah! Oh, I love that! Oh, yeah! Well, see, I've got a problem, Anthony, in my left eye. I don't even know what you call the vision in the left eye. It's not shadows, it's not anything. It's just like-- imagine looking through... a futon plastic bag. That's how my sight is. It's really weird. But I thank God that I'm healthy-- I can walk-- I pray at night. Do you ever think, why God did that? Why God let it happen? No. But there's no reason why He can't fix it. No. The future has a lot of things in store for us, for these young blind people. God gave me the intelligence. My parents-- my grandparents on both sides are ministers, and we always argue about God, because I don't really believe in church at all. I don't-- I don't necessarily believe that anybody can tell you how to relate to God. Nobody can tell you. It's all up to you. - He tells you. - Yeah, that's right. He tells you. All he says is, "Live just, live right, follow these commandments and you'll be--" "Live honestly," He says. "Be honest. Be honest about who you are." I say, when I talk to him, I've got to thank him for the day, 'cause I live day by day. Jesus said in the Bible... "Cursed be he who obstructs a blind man-- who obstructs a blind man's path-- who puts an obstacle in the path of a blind man." "Cursed be he who puts an obstacle in the path of a blind man, and cursed is he who sleeps with his sister." "Cursed be he who sleeps with his sister." You know what you were saying about the commandments? No, but, he also says that, "Present yourself honestly--" "Present yourself honestly about who you are, because if you don't, I'm gonna make things really bad for you." "Once upon a time, there was a young man..." Yeah. "For your mind. Dedicated." "Victor's a nice man. Yeah." "Go, Victor. Go, Julien." - "Go, James..." - Yeah. "I'm a black albino straight from Alabama, way down south." "You know, I'm a black albino, straight from Alabama way down south." "Then you know that I'm a black albino, straight from Alabama. Yeah." "Check it out. Well, salutations from Polk, it's the up above. There's no mistaking about the name, - because it couldn't be..." - Yeah! All right! All right! "...black albino, straight from Alabama..." - Go, James! - "...way down south. Then you know that I'm a black albino straight from Alabama, way down south. Then you know that I'm a black albino straight from Alabama, way down south. Then you know that I'm a black albino straight from Alabama. You've got to be smooth. Oh-- smooth! What does it mean? I feel just like the E.F. Hutton of the hip-hop scene. I can kick a rhyme other MCs might miss, and it goes a little something like this-- Hit it-- a long time ago, I couldn't even flow, you know? I had an Afro, and I rapped slow. But I took a look inside a book, to find my nook in society. I'm tired of my piety. The plan, understand, was to become the grand man on the rap stand, and dish out my own brand of justice, 'cause it seems that when I bust this, people gather 'round and say, "Aw nuts!" This Polky bust rhymes the public never heard before. The suckers bag the mike and start heading for the door. ...then you know it's a black albino straight from Alabama, way down south. Then you know that I'm a black albino straight from Alabama, way down south..." Go, Franklin! Yeah! Back in the 50s, they had this world championship of talking birds. And they sent all these parrots and beals-- it's a starling type of bird from Borneo-- and boy, do they speak well. But the championship back then was won by a parakeet, a little parakeet. And the parakeet would say, "Birds are smart, but they can not speak." and that really made him Boy, was that bird good. You can still buy a record which repeats and repeats his sentence, "Birds are smart, but they cannot speak." and you can teach your own bird. Maybe even dogs are gonna talk one day. When we were kids arriving at the breakfast table, we had to say a poem and it went like this... "...Schlup, schlup, schlup, milch ist gut..." Then we were allowed to have our cereal and coffee and whatever there was. He loves me, he loves me not. He loves me, he loves me not. He loves me... He loves me not. He loves me, he loves me not. He loves me, he loves me not. He loves me, he loves me not. He loves me, he loves me not. The mailman loves me, he loves me not. The mailman loves me, he loves me not. The mailman loves me, he loves me not. I hate the mailman! - Hello? - Mommy? - Hello, Julien? - Mommy!? - Hi! - Hi, Mommy. - Hi! - Mommy. I can call you "Mother"? - Mom? - Yes? - Hi. - Hi, Julien. - Hi, Mom. - How are you? I'm doing real good, Mom. I'm fine. I'm a lot better now. Are you a dietitian, still, or are you a waitress? No, no. I'm neither one now. Okay. I know. You're a cop. A traffic cop. Like a female police officer of the law. No. No. I'm a dentist now. I fix people's teeth when they're in pain. Uh-huh. What do you do to dentist? Did you go to law school? No, I'm just a basic general dental practitioner. People come to see me when they have, you know, mouth pain or different sorts of ailments, and different sorts of gum diseases. Are you going to participate in any plastic surgery there? No, sometimes when people smoke too frequently their teeth get dirty and me and my staff will whiten them with special dental tools. What about my teeth, Mom? I got-- I got gold fronts. Chris got me some gold fronts. My baby brother got me some gold fronts for my birthday. That was very nice of him. Yeah. I can eat through apples and table tops. I don't believe you. I love you, Mom. I miss you, Mom. I wish you were still here. Like when I was a little baby, Mom. Yeah. I love you too, Julien. And I'm watching you. All those voices you're hearing, those are just friendly voices. No one's out to get you. No one wants to hurt you. Right? Julien? I wish you were still here, Mom, like when I was six, when I was six you sang me "Frere Jacques." "Frere Jacques, Frere Jacques, dormez vous? " When I was six, Pearl was four. Chris was just a little baby, Mom. Remember Chris was just a little baby? He killed you in the hospital. When they took you away in the hospital and they killed you dead. Remember, Mom? Chris was just a little baby boy. How are your teeth, Julien? - They're okay. - Are you brushing daily? Remember to brush in the crevices, and in between the teeth, because that's where the majority of cavities arrive. And then floss weekly, at least, the minimum you must floss is once a week. I promise. I will, I will. I promise, Mom. I'll floss like when you were still alive, when you were still in the house. I'll floss like I did before you were dead, Mom. I'll floss like that. I promise. Okay, I've got to go. I got to go. I love you, Mom. I really love you. I love you, too. I love you, too. You're my best friend. You're my best friend, okay? - Okay. I love you too, Julien. - I love you too, Mom. Take good care of your teeth and you'll always be a happy person. Okay, Julien? Bye. - Mom? - Yes? - Bye, Mom. - Bye. I love you. Bye. This is gonna be the world-famous ground flip. Pearl, Pearl, Pearl. I got a-- I got a-- I got a poem. You want to hear it? Yeah. Daddy, can I read a poem? Okay. "Midnight chaos... Eternity chaos... Morning chaos, eternity chaos, noon chaos, eternity chaos, evening chaos, eternity chaos, midnight chaos, eternity chaos, morning chaos, eternity chaos, noon chaos-- evening chaos, eternity chaos, midnight chaos, eternity chaos... morning chaos, eternity chaos, noon chaos, eternity chaos, evening chaos, eternity chaos... midnight chaos, eternity chaos, noon chaos, eternity chaos, evening chaos, eternity chaos..." Julien, cut it out. "Morning chaos, eternity chaos..." You're repeating "Chaos, chaos." It doesn't even rhyme. - It rhyme with chaos. - Oh, come on. Come on, stop that. That's not a poem. I'm not finished. - "Midnight--" - What kind of poem is that? It doesn't even rhyme. You repeat "Chaos, chaos." It doesn't even rhyme. - How about that? - "Midnight..." Shut up. Shut up. I don't like it because it's so artsy-fartsy. You see, I like the real stuff. I like something like, uh, the end of "Dirty Harry." I saw this "Dirty Harry," and the end is really-- a terrific showdown. What? There was this tremendous shoot out. You should better listen. Just listen. Grandmama, listen. Just listen. There was this shoot out. Dirty Harry has this bad guy cornered. I mean, he was a real bad guy, and there's this tremendous shoot out. They're really exchanging lots of fire. They're shooting bullets at each other and they keep missing. At the end the bad guy somehow drops his gun. It's just down there on the bottom. Harry hovers over him, and now Harry, he is really full of contempt. Harry's standing there, he's totally full of contempt, and he says to him, "We've wasted many of our bullets. Do you think there's still a bullet left in your gun? " and he says to him, "You know, now you've got to ask yourself a question: 'Do I feel lucky?'" At that moment, the bad guy lunges for his gun, raises it and it goes, "click." He hasn't got a bullet left. And Harry blasts him away. He blasts him into a river. He knocks him off the feet and blasts him away. You see, that's good stuff. I truly like that. I don't like the artsy-fartsy thing. I think I hated his poem. Now, Chris I'd like to see you do that. You see, it's all balance. I'd like to see that. You're really balancing. I mean, in the balance. in the balance. You know what I had to do when I was a ski jumper when I was your age? We had a real, real mean nasty trick to do. We put a cigarette on the ground-- just like that-- and a glass of water. You just gotta step on this glass, and you have to pick it up, you have to balance. You have to pick it up with your mouth without falling. It's really a tough one. - You can do it? - I don't think I can anymore, but you should be able to do it. It's all balance. Argh! Could you ever do it? Yeah, it was difficult, but I could do it. You see, I really wanted to be a champion. I really wanted to be good. He's going to do it, Grandmama. Yeah, that's it. All right. All right. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. That's good. You're gonna do it. In two or three weeks, you're gonna do that. I just did it. Yeah, but you fell. You see you've got to raise up again, and smoke the cigarette. That's a proud man who smokes a cigarette like that. - I don't smoke. - You'll learn it. All right. All right. "My bonnie... lies over the ocean." Everybody know that one? "My bonnie lies over the ocean, my bonnie lies over the sea, my bonnie lies over the ocean, oh, bring my poor bonnie to me. Bring back, bring back, bring back my bonnie to me..." That's my son up there! "My bonnie lies over the ocean, but my bonnie doesn't lie over me!" Let's party! It's a great act for blind people. My first wife did that. Not with cigarettes, though. What else you got, man? Get him out of here! Get him out of here! Well, that's it. Thank you very much. Amen! A-woman! All right! "Amen... Amen, Amen, Amen, Amen Amen... Amen, Amen, Amen, Amen See the baby Jesus, Lying in the manger Amen, Amen, Amen, Amen..." The words are easy. "Amen..." Amen! "Amen, Amen, Amen, Amen." "We don't need no music We don't need no music We don't need no music We don't need no music." "I feel good-- nah-na, nah-na, nah-na-- I knew that I would-- nah-na, nah-na, nah-na I feel good-- nah-na, nah-na, nah-na I knew that I would..." That's funny. "So good-- so good-- I've got you. I feel nice-- nah-na, nah-na, nah-na like sugar and spice-- nah-na, nah-na, nah-na..." That's my favorite song. I love that song. What song? That song-- "Nah-na, nah-na, nah. I feel Tosh--" That's a really good song. I think one day when my feet break apart, I'm gonna need new feet. I'm gonna have to sew these feet back on. I met a man that was made of clay, like me, and he said, "If you want to have clay feet, you've got to listen to clay tapes." Stop! That tickles! I'm sorry. You don't have to be sorry. It feels good. Does this tickle, with my brush? Yes. All my boyfriends are dead, and you're gonna die too-- maybe you too, Julien. I died before, you know. I died before. I'm gonna die before I die. I'm gonna make a high dive, and then as soon as I land in the water, I'm gonna die. - Really? - Yeah.

Over there, where every day, is a day, of jubilee, where we will sing... There may be one that's out of the ark of safety. If you're here, we invite you to come. The spirit said, "Come." And whosoever will," He said, "Let it come." If you come... I heard, Jesus said, "I will in no wise--" He will in no wise cast you out. Come to him right now, while you still have a chance. If you are here today. There is no forgiveness of sins-- Amen-- and so by the blood of Jesus, Amen-- we are forgiven for our sins. Amen. So I come to tell you today that, uh... that the blood of Jesus Christ Amen-- cleansed us from all of our sins. Thank God for Jesus. We all are forgiven, by that same blood. And I'm glad today, beloved, because when I have done wrong, and when my sins catch up with me, Jesus, Amen, when the Lord looks at me, he don't see me, but he sees the blood of Jesus. And when Jesus died on the cross, God was dying on the cross. For God was in Christ Jesus, reconciling the world unto himself. And I'm glad to know that I'm justified. I've been set free... Amen-- because of the blood of Jesus. Not because of what I have done, but because of what He has done. And I'm glad to know that Jesus paid the price. He ransomed us from the very gates of hell. I don't know about you, but I'm glad that I've been washed in his blood. I'm glad to know that I've been redeemed by the blood of the Lamb. His blood has made my spirit clean, and His blood has wrote my name above. I don't know about you, but I was a sinner one day, but I'm glad that I plunged in that fountain, Amen, and I've been set free today. And I don't know about you, but I'm glad that we can sing this song, "What can wash away my sins? " We have heard from heaven today. The Lord has stopped by and visited us. You know, I'm so glad of one thing, as we get ready to go... Amen, I feel good... I know that can't nobody, do me like Jesus. If you don't mind, we're gonna do just a little bit of that great song, and we'll be on our way home. "Can't nobody... do me like Jesus, Can't nobody do me like the Lord Can't nobody do me like Jesus, He's my friend." Yeah!

In two months' time it's due. How do you think the future for the baby looks? - Bright. - Bright? - Bright as the sun. - Whoa. How come everybody comes out of their mother's stomach as a baby? Because they have to be so small to fit in there. There's not a lot of room. They can't just come out as 11 or 12 year olds, 'cause then it would be really, really big, and so painful. Could you imagine? That would be horrible. and your ice cream. Five bucks a shoe, and the ice cream. a dime for those. You know... I could make those myself.

So if nobody ever told you, you would have never known. No. I thought I could really see-- almost normal sight, but, I found out I'm not even close.
