The bullets are here. OK Where's the gun going? Kowloon Gun Club Forgot to congratulate the new champ, where're the celebrating? After the storage, overtime at the office.

Drop your gun! Hey! Freeze! Officer, I have nothing to do with this... All of you! Don't move! Ammo! Wait! Got any more? None! Cover me! Go! Harry! My name is Kwan. I just saw a armoured truck being robbed... it's at... the exit of South Bay Tunnel, west bound lane. The armoured truck got robbed by 3 guys... they shot the security guards, and another man... then a traffic cop came and got shot too. I just finished a shooting competition, that's why I've got a gun. In order to save the cop, I shot the three robbers. Another man escaped... Get an ambulance, quick! I called the police! Get down! Turn around and get down! The traffic cop's not dead... The traffic cop's not dead yet! What are you doing, stop... Billy, hang in there! Move back, clear the area, don't block the way... What about his family? Notified, should be here soon. Ting, I saw your boyfriend in the ER. Sir, it's him. Can I help you? Police routine, won't take too long. How come it's you? I saw the robbery. I'm a CID inspector. I'm in charge of this case How come you fired the gun? The robbers killed the security guards... and was about to kill the traffic officer. Other injuries? Remove the cuffs. What? I was just with him at a competition. We'll continue down at the station. Doctor is here... The traffic officer is Billy Tsui. Billy the twin? You know him? I know his brother, a sniper from Hit Team. His whole family are in the police force. His situation's critical. Bullet shot through the helmet and penetrated his left brain. I have to operate on him now. Be careful... aunt... Mom, let her sit down first. Ma'am don't worry. Mom, don't worry, it'll be okay. Warren Warren, he's the one who shot the robbers. Wait a sec! Are you the one, who shot and killed the robbers? I'm his brother, Warren. Thank you I'm sorry. I should have fired sooner. Let me summarize this case. Bergman Brothers is a non public investment bank. Their own private armoured truck... carrying 'Bearer Bonds' that was to be shipped to Berlin was robbed. There are 7 fatalities, Including 3 security guards, a bank manager... and 3 suspects with no ID. Traffic officer Billy Tsui, got shot and is in a coma. Our only witness Ken Kwan, is making a statement now. He said one suspect had fled. We'll have a composite drawing Alan, take AB teams, check everyone's background. Yes, sir! Logan, lead C D team follow up on all the hard evidence. Yes, sir! I prepared a checklist for everyone. No need for details yet. Sir... No questions for now. This is just another case of robbery. Don't be fazed by the body count and get off track. Be patient. Get sufficient evidence. Build a solid case. Meeting at 8am tomorrow. Yes, sir! Like this? Yes Okay From the traffic department, eat it while it's hot. Born in Hong Kong in '75. Father passed away early. Early and junior high educated in government schools. An Honored student in '92. Finished psychology at Hong Kong U, then studied economics in the U.S. Easier to get a job I guess? Recruited by a head hunter in '03. Returned to Hong Kong and joined an investment company. Became a team leader in just three years. Last year's bonus alone was over Own two properties in Hong Kong. Bought your mom and sister a house in Vancouver. Driving skills not bad either. Not one traffic ticket all these years. You're a cautious man! By the way, I need your advice. There's a girl, who saw a boy at her father's funeral. It was love at first sight. A month later, the girl's sister was murdered. The murderer, turns out to be the girl. So why did she kill her sister? In order to arrange another funeral, so she can see the boy again. That's why she killed her sister. For the sake of seeing that person, is it worth it? She's an introverted and obsessed person. She acts only according to her instinct. She had no choice. I never study psychology, but I'm quite interested. I read a lot on this subject. If I'm a suspect, shouldn't I have a lawyer present... before I answer any more questions? You're the only witness. I have to detain you for more questioning. Go ahead, eat! The food here sucks. Even we are the police, has no choice here. Everything's poison nowadays, there's no choice anyways. Choices or not, it has nothing to do with the world. It's all about ourselves. Looks like you've got the book. Martin Goodman's 'Criminals and their Motivations'. According to his research, over 80% of the criminals felt they had no choice. I better study more before I see you the next time. Firearms and Ammunition Ordinance A financial genius heroically rescue patrol officer. Alright everyone, meeting! Draw the shades please. Let's start. There's no ID on any of the suspect. Probably not local. Passed all the prints and photo to other departments and Interpol. Security guards Doug Wong, Jim Lee and Joe Shing, their background check all came back clean. However, Fong, the manager, just lost over 6 million in the stock market. We're looking into that. Serial numbers on the guns all destroyed. Barrels purposely scratched too. Can't retrieve any record. This gun was put together, with parts that can be bought easily. So it's untraceable. Parts can be bought easily? Meaning? Amateur gun fanatics are real pro nowadays, many of the parts are actually use on real guns. You can buy these in any of the toy store in town. That's legal? Springs, screws, triggers, how can they be illegal? If you can't buy them, you can make it yourself. Found a cell on one of the suspects. Pre-paid card bought from the streets. I checked the call history, only one outgoing call. After the robbery, the numbers hasn't been used. The route map was sealed in this envelope. The manager was given this before the journey. He was to open it when he get inside the armoured truck. That means, no one should know the route beforehand. The truck didn't follow the route. It must be an inside job. Remember, the deceased are only leads. The important thing now, is to find HIM. This is a sample, of the Bearer Bonds that are missing. Valued at 400 million US dollars. Wow, 400million US... Stop wishing. If suspect 'X' has the bonds, he'll convert it to cash. Hei, contact the Commercial Crime Unit, check and see who'd be interested. Yes, sir! What about him? Clean Release him, Sir? Charge him with murder and possession of firearms. Charge him? Anything wrong? Sir, he saved one of our own! So tell me, which law says he can kill a person? Any person may arrest without warrant any person whom... he may reasonably suspect of being guilty of an arrestable offence. And also 101A A person may use such force... as is reasonable in the circumstances in the prevention of crime. You better understand this, Right to 'arrest', but no right to shoot! But sir, did you think about the public reaction? The media labeled him as a hero! We charge him we get shit, haul over coals if we don't. The Boss's decided, we'll pass the 'ball' to the court. Let the jury decide. Sir What're we going to tell traffic department? Any fuss, tell them to go to the prosecutor. Well, better not drive tomorrow. Traffic guys sure gonna hammer us with tickets. I read the book again last night. Even Martin Goodman can't find a motive for your crime. I believe you're not involved in this, but you broke the firearm legislation, and killed people. I was saving someone. Saving or killing, it's not up to me to decide. Am I in big trouble? Very much so! Better bring a good lawyer... to court tomorrow. How's it going? We'll approach the judge tomorrow, volunteer a bail with sizeable amount. How much? Okay, let the solicitors know. Money's no object, including their fees and expenses. Mentioned that already. By the way, we need a couple of high profile guarantors. I'll take care of it. Fine, keep in touch. Bye! Miss Shaw, this case is not simple. He's not going to get off that easy. What about his accounts? You want to take over? That's not what I meant. We have a fully automated system. Trading only proceed if the prices are marked and locked in. So what's the problem? I'm just saying, in case his client calls... If his client calls, just say I'm in charge. You understand? Yes. Then why are you still here? Ken Kwan who was charged with murder and illegal use of firearm... was in court today. The defendant put up a record breaking bail of 10 million dollars, and with the support of 7 elite guarantors behind him, he was released. They include Kevin Leung, vice chairman of Bolton Bank, . Anna Shaw, president of Universal Investment Group... Are you alright? Thanks Close the curtain. Did you just thank me? Must be hungry, what would you like? I just want to sleep. Can't go back just yet. Ming, drive us around Repulse Bay, before we head home. Step over these swords, it'll take away the bad luck. When did you become superstitious? Just getting old, I guess. When you realize you can't beat the odds, you'll become superstitious. You lost a lot? Because of what's going on, I didn't have the time to monitor the team. They bought in Euros and lost big time. First thing in the morning, got some explaining to do in London. Told Susan to book you a ticket as well. My agenda is till... Wednesday. Then it'll just you and I. I can't leave town. Stay with me tonight then? I missed you. You have nothing to ask me? Is it necessary? Go take a shower. And throw all these old clothes away Mr. Kwan Don't disturb her. The doctor said he's stable. A patient woke up after two years in a coma once. So, don't worry. If there's any changes, let me know. Mr. Kwan, how long have you been shooting? Five years Why are you so interested in this sport? It has similar characteristics as my work. It requires complete focus and precision. Why don't you choose golf? Golf's the same. Like soccer, swimming, it's personal preference. Do you have tendency towards violence? No, I don't. No? Then why did you treat the suspects like targets, and fired so many shots into each of them? Your honour, Hong Kong has 2286 people with gun licenses. The prosecutor's assuming all have tendency towards violence. I can answer that. It's a reflex action, combat shooting often uses multiple shots. The purpose is to guarantee a hit. So you shoot a man, thinking you're in a competition? No. I know I'm not in the army. But the training are quite similar. Multiple shots undermine the oppositions' abilities to shoot back. Special Force are trained that way. Could you tell me... when shooting a target or shooting at a man, are the feelings the same? Your Honour... Mr. Chan, I don't see the point of your question. I'll ask another question, Your Honor. Do you realize that a gun can kill? Yes, so could a golf club. Ever fantasized about killing someone? Yes Ever fantasized, about shooting a bullet into a human body? Yes Can you describe this fantasy of yours? I think most people from young age, came across images of killings before. From movies, news, I've imagined what it'll be like to shoot a bullet into a person. But after experiencing combative shooting, after handling the gun, and realized its power, and the danger, these thoughts, never appeared again. A person's interests, can reflect his character and personality, do you agree? I know you studied psychology, I'm sure you can answer that. Yes, I agree. Then do you realize... when a person shoots a human-shaped target for a long duration... it increases his tendency to kill subconsciously? I know. That's why in order to reduce the public's misunderstanding, and to gain access into the Olympics, the association no longer use... the human-shaped target. Mr. Chan, could you please be more direct with your questions? Yes, Your Honour. Are you familiar with the Firearms and Ammunition Ordinance? Absolutely Do you know, unless it's at the gun club or on competition ground, you have absolutely no right to use any firearms? I do, but at that moment... A simple answer will do! Your Honour, the defendant has the right to elaborate. You may continue. While I was in custody, I couldn't sleep. I kept asking myself... if I did the right thing. I kept thinking, why I didn't turn the car around and leave. I knew I'd be in trouble if I shoot, so why I still chose to do it. Finally, I stopped blaming myself. Because I know if I didn't shoot, the traffic cop would be dead. My intention was to save a life, I have absolutely no regrets. If it happens again, I believe, I'll do the same thing. Your Honour, clearly, the prosecutor tried to establish the defendant as a long time shooter, a crazed killer who shoots a person just for the sake of it. I don't think he needed to go to the trouble... of using such severe terminology to defame my client. Because without a doubt he broke the firearm code of law. However, may I remind everyone, Human established the Legislation with great intents and purposes. It is to protect the lives of people's and their properties. The legislation are not just words, if we overlook the law is for the people, then the Legislation would lose its fundamental significance. Let us think about this. If we see a traffic officer... about to be killed by gangsters. Do we want to save him? I believe majority of us do. But, do we have the courage to do so? I could honestly say, most of us don't. He did commit a murder. But no one can deny the fact, that with extraordinary courage, he did what anyone with the sense of decency would do. Unfortunately, his defeat is not to the lack of morality, but defeated by the Firearm Legislation. I would like you to know, similar case in many other countries are legal There wouldn't even be grounds for prosecution. If he had used his fists that day, or used a stick to save that traffic officer, he would not be in this predicament today. If it is because of legislation, that prevent us from saving a dying officer, wouldn't that be ridiculous? Your Honour, a case like this has no precedence. The outcome of this case would set a template for future justice. I hereby, urge you members of the jury, to find my client 'not guilty'. This case has caused a lot of controversy. We have with us Professor Lau to help us analyze this case. Professor Lau, the jury have been deliberating for 6 hours. What is your view on this? It would be very hard for the jury, not be influenced by all the media coverage. I'm sure this is a tug of war between logic and emotion. I believe that the judge will be reminding them, that they have to abide by the law. Stand up Jury do you have a unanimous verdict? We unanimously agreed that, the defendant on the charges of illegal use of firearm and 3 counts of murder, not guilty. This court finds the defendant not guilty and shall be released. The court thank the jurors for their time on this case. Take care! Congratulations Mr. Kwan. See you at the game. Mr. Kwan hurry, there's a lot of reporters. Can you talk us please? Can you tell us how you feel now? What's your opinion on the verdict Prof. Lau? This verdict is totally not acceptable, the judge did not give the jury an appropriate guideline. I believe that the Government will confer with the prosecutor, and launch an appeal. What's this? Playing hooky. Hey, I'm on holiday. Holiday? Why aren't you partying? If I want to party, I wouldn't get transferred here. Any fish here? Plenty! Loads! Garoupas! Even squid at night. Hey! You look beat! Can't sleep. Really tough case? No more leads. So now you come to me?! Common, give me break. Came for a visit and get some fresh air, that's all. New edition! Psychology? Haven't read this stuff for ages. Heard you broke my record. Same points, beat you by 0.6 sec on swift. But lost 0.31 at the end. That means I lost a whole second? Well, never mind. Held that record for so many years. It's about time. He's lucky. He shot a triple tap at the end. You think you're playing golf? 'Hole in one' is lucky! A triple tap, got nothing to do the hands. It's about instinct. Like in the movies, 'man' and 'weapon' becomes one? Skills, require unending practices. After you achieve absolute confidence, instinct will make you take the move... with no hesitance. Wow, that's zen! You'll understand when you get to that level. Are you for real? Did you make that up? You really want to beat him? As if you know? Don't be that desperate. What for? If there is a duel, half a sec or so means nothing. Both get the shot at the end anyways. He's clean for sure? Who? The guy who beat us! No way! No suspicion and got no motives. And he's loaded! Billionaires' loaded too. Don't see them retiring? It really can't be! So? What's the criminal mindset? I was just taking in some fresh air. Sir, just sliced it up. It's really fresh today! Cutting another one inside, I'll get it for you. Hey, there's two of us here, get another chopsticks. Okay Tell me... If I assume there's no fish here, how can I be eating... sashimi? Delicious! Ladies and Gentlemen, Asia Investors Association presents an award annually... to one of our colleagues, for the best judgment, creativity... and over all performances. Tonight, the recipient is very special. Not only this is his second award, but he is the fourth time champion of the 'HKPSC' competition. Let us give a hearty welcome, to our 'Best Foreign Funding Manager', our Shooting Champion, Mr. Ken Kwan! We also ask our chairman to come up and present this award. Actually life doesn't have enough time... that allow us to think and be analytical. Whether to invest or to save a life, when timing is right, one has to make a move without hesitation. I'd like to thank the judges, all my colleagues at the office, and my boss, Miss Anna Shaw. Thank you Congratulations! Thank you. Congratulations! Anna. Thank you. Congratulations. Everyone knows... you're the one whose behind this. You should thank me for picking up the award for you. Can we leave now? Don't be childish. All the people here, can help you in many ways. Miss Shaw, haven't seen you for awhile. Hi! How're you? Fine! Mr. Kwan, congratulations. After the financial crisis, there's still a lot of money out there. Russian financial oligarchs doesn't want their money locked in Europe. They've been shifting over here. Be careful of dirty money! Mr. Ko Was there a lot of money laundering then? Of course. In the old days, if there's a winning lottery ticket, the police inspectors will offer big bucks to buy it. Claim the winnings, into their pockets clean as a whistle. Then there's gambling boats, even more convenient. Get on the boat, for a couple of spins, who's there to find out? What sort of people were they? Tax evasions, corruptions all sorts. Back then, 30% service charge was pretty steep. Then the law became more tougher. Service charge just went berserk. To make one 'spin' nowadays, I heard you're left with only 30% cleaned dough. Wow, that much! Don't joke around! Monetary Authority hears you, you'll be put away. Anna Give me a price right now. I must have this guy. I'll give you 3 years advance salary, you can start tomorrow. Joyce, not in your life time will you ever get my guy. In this city, everyone has a price tag. You tell, how much do you want? Who is this? Your friend? In principle... not really. Excuse me. Who cares, got the odds against you right? Of course you can say that, you've earned enough. That's true. Mr. Kwan Congratulations. Congratulations. Good job, continue next year. By the way... CY's back soon, he'll call you. Want to come up? I need to be alone. Have you left her yet? No. These things are hurtful, so handle it carefully. You know how I feel about you. I just want you to love me. No matter how serious things get, I'll help you. That, I know I can do. You know what I mean, right? Ken I'm thinking when to resign. I left my phone in the car, I'll go get it. I'm not calling her. What's the matter? What happened? He's dangerous, forget it! Freeze! Don't run! Freeze! It's okay, we're cops. I guess he's the guy that got away. You killed his buddies, he's out for revenge. The paper mentioned your name, and where you work. Not that hard to track you down. How long have I been followed? I guess he started... right after you got out. I meant your guys. You're a tax payer. We have to offer you some service. You're using me as a bait? I just want my normal life back. Can't you guys leave me alone? Let me say this. They can disappear in a second. Nothing difficult. But the suspect won't let you off easy. He's already under a lot of pressure. Just don't following him anymore. Look, he saved one of our man. We don't want anything to happen to him. Haven't I... seen you at the trial? And the hospital? Just for your girlfriend's safety then. My guys will just follow you. They won't disturb you. Call me if you need me, anytime you want. Hey, where is he? Let's check over there. Is it necessary in front of all these people? What is this? Let's talk at the station. Universal Investment, hello? Mr. Kwan Looking for me? I need your advice? Got a moment? Of course. You know the 'bearer bonds' that's went missing? I'd like to know how it works. I wouldn't know. You don't? In our business, we have stocks, bonds... commodities and FX. They're all different. Oh... you mean like surgeons and specialist. So what do you do? It's difficult to explain. Come on in. Make it simple, I'll understand. It's about the clients who put their money with us. We take their funds and make investments. I'm in Foreign Exchange. You take a commission from the profit? We charge a fee first. Wow, that's better than the casino? You guys are like legal professional gamblers? Can't say that, our company has many financial specialists, who use the most sophisticated software to analyze the market. It's more professional. Profit guaranteed? It's not stipulated in the contract. But I haven't lost an investment... since 2002. I better make some investments myself! Minimum 1 million US over there. In there? My side 30 million. VIP upstairs... 100 million. Shit! These are information on the Bearer Bonds. Actually, you can get the info online as well. Too many coffees? Or... Because I killed a person. I went to a psychiatrist. Took prescription drugs, still can't sleep. I was trying to live. Because of survival, sometimes you can hurt someone... unintentionally. By the way, when you joined the company, this guy was working here. Any recollection? Hey... Anything wrong? Miss Shaw, I've read your interviews in the economic pages. He asked me if I knew this man. Our company has over 700 employees working on 3 floors. Some employees never even met their peers before. Are you here for investigation? Actually no, I'm finished with Mr. Kwan here. Except at the competition next year! I won't allow him to touch gun again. You're not signing up? You're not backing out, are you? It's World's Championship in South Africa! Hope you'll reconsider... I signed up already. He will not be competing again. You understand what I'm saying? Thank you. I'm sure this guy has a purpose. Be careful. Purpose for what? Just intuition. What about you? What's your purpose? Me? Why do you always want people to know... that you own me? What if everyone knows you belong to me? So what? Why are you so bothered by it? Hey, Mr. Kwan long time no see. Oops, right! Forgot you were in deep shit. Where's the boss? Not here! Did he mention when he's coming back? He did called, but he said he won't be back for a while. Confidentially, he's been acting strangely. Mumbling to himself all the time. Saying something like... You want my life? I'll get my revenge or I'm a half breed. I think he lost his marbles. Hey... if you see him, tell him to get back here soon. The landlord's going to shut us down if we don't pay the rent! Park behind there. Lucky you. I thought they locked your license away. There 's an ex-champ name Jim Mew, a cop. He killed his predecessor who's a mental case, he got over his inner turmoil. But after he shot and killed another scumbag, he couldn't pick up his gun again. Give it a try. If you can't, don't force yourself. Can't shoot? You killed before, why bother with paper target? Shoot me instead. Pull the trigger! You bastard! Wanted to kill me?! Didn't you try to kill me that night? I want to alright... I wanted to kill your bitches too. Say that again... You say that again! Toa... Okay! Save it! I'm here for my money! I get my money I'm gone. You won't see me ever again! The banker who's suppose to help me got arrested! So, just go get another banker then! No one's willing to take these bonds. I'm trying to sort things out. You said these bonds are like cash! So if it is, how come no one wants it? You think it's simple, you handle it! If I know how, who the hell need you? You told me it's worth millions, so I went for it. Now you get to play the hero, and me?! I'm hiding all over! Why are you so edgy! No one recognize you! If you need cash, I'll give it to you, what's your rush? Give me some more time! I'll get it done! But there's one thing we can't wait. That cop might wake up. If he does, he'll blow everything out. Then that's it for us! Why don't you do it? Well, thanks to you! The cops on me 24/7 Okay. But I want half the stash. If you get it done, you can have it all. Cops Making offerings to yourself too? Only got this photo, might as well keep him company. Hey... who are you? Hey! What are you doing?! Get over here! Chong Sir... Inspector, can we talk... Nothing to say. He's clean for sure? Who? The guy who beat us. Chong Sir Where was he at 11 pm? At home. Today's activities? Went to the office by 8am, had lunch downstairs at 1 pm, then went to a gun shop in Mongkok, proceeded to the Gun Club at 4pm, then... Say it! Lost him, we didn't see him leave the Gun Club. Rushed back here after the Club closed. He got home by 10pm. What's wrong? Someone tried to kill the cop at the hospital just now. That serious? Come on in. Check around. The patient was shot in the chest. The bullet exited through the left underarm. Fortunately, no major organ damages. After emergency operation, the patient's condition is stable. He's tough. How's his family? Don't worry about his family. Worry about yourself. Someone wants him dead. You mean the one who got away? I need your advice again. In your statement, the escaped suspect was wearing a disguise. Traffic cop can't identify him. You can't either. Nobody knows who he is. So why did he take the risk and come back? I don't know about case profiling. Tell you what... I'll help you do some research, and find about his frame of mind. Okay Thank you. I better go. You want something to eat? I made some snack. You can cook? Hard to believe. Just average. You know everything. No, that's not it. Just a little effort and patience that's all. I'll try it sometime. Never mind, I'm going. Ah, remember, be careful. I will. Upstairs please. Mr. Kong I'm KC's friend. Did you talk to him about this on the phone? No. That moron, didn't even know his phone was tapped. What'd you have? Customer of mine needs to cash some bearer bonds. From the heist? KC said you won't ask the source. It's too exposed. You've to keep it for years before you can sell them. Too risky and too expensive. What's the difference, holding the bonds and a death warrant? Bottom line 17.5%, I'll burn it if you don't want it. That's the deal. Let's go. Hey! What's up? Creeping around with the van. Get in. Let's burn some offerings for our buddies. They're your buddies, not mine. What about Fong! We were all buddies, you cold-blooded bastard! Stop being an animal! Lost so much dough you've lost your head too! Come and get your 'money'! Come and get your 'money'! I'm not that bad, honestly. Go take your broad and travel. Get on the plane a few times. You'll come back squeaky clean. The cop's not dead. Dumping the rich broad, and settle with the nurse? You really think you can feed on passion? Stupid idiot... Do you know the cop's not dead! No, he's not dead. He's just not dead yet! Maybe he's a goner now! Take these cash and get out, I never want to see you again! You think I want to see you again? It's in sequence? So they can't use this. But then they found... an idiot to make the exchange! You're such an idiot... I'm so stupid. At least it's easier to hide the bonds! Now with all these bags... Where're we going to put it?! Under the bed! What?! Under the bed! Then go to the market... spend a few at a time! I'm afraid my cleaning lady may find it! Hey, wonder what she'll do if she sees the money?! She'll say: Mister boss... so much US dollars under your bed, can I... borrow some? Now what? Burn it. You don't want it, I do! How can you? They ask for ID at the exchange. You're going to show it? Spend it in the States? The supermarket takes credit cards even for few bucks. You carry a few thousands on you, the cops will think you're a dope dealer! I have a few hundred grand. I'll give it to you tomorrow. A few hundred grand? You're giving me donation? We're out in the woods. How are you going to carry all this money?! Have you gone crazy? Don't push me! If I rat you out in court, let's see who gets more time If I'm finished, I'll take your 2 bitches with me to the grave. What are you staring at? Get away! Why did you make me do this? Why did you make me do this! Mr. Kwan Client's dumping Yen big time, Miss Shaw called a meeting. A corpse! Let's get out of here! Sir Found a body, shot in head, there's a cell phone on the body. Contact list has a number, belong to the cell from the crime scene. It's suspect 'X'. Deceased is Pang Tao, did 8 years for robbery in '95. Someone financed him with this shop. He specialize in converting air guns. There's a burnt vehicle 800 meters way from the body. It has what seems like ashes of burnt currency notes in it. It's down at the lab right now. When prosecutor asked him, why he fired 2 shots into each victim, what was his answer? He said it was a reflex action. You try it. Begin. Shoot the targets I call. Feet Hand Within 2 seconds, you put 2 shots into different parts of the body. With his skills, he could have disarmed the victims. Every shot he made was fatal, obviously he meant to kill. How can you let yourself to be duped? Why did you suspected him once, and then dismissed him as a suspect so quickly? Why did you fire the gun? Those robbers killed the security guards. And was about to kill the traffic officer. I was saving a life. If it happens again, I'll do the same thing. Was it because he defeated you... and didn't want others to think you have a personal vendetta? Maybe you really wanted to beat him, so subconsciously you failed to arrest him? I think you are concern about the competition, more than this case. Mew Sir I need to know his motives. Would you help me? Shooter, are you ready? Hand! Head! You're OK? Fine. Why did you kill them? I had to kill them all. The traffic officer has to die too. Why did you do it? The traffic cop recognized you? The traffic cop knew who you were? Why did you kill him? I have to kill the witness, I must kill the witness. Why did you do that? I need to kill him. Cause he recognize me! There's more to it than that. Don't lie to me! Why did you wanted to kill him! Say it! Because he saw something he shouldn't have! Don't get too close! Get back!! Get back! Get back! Get back! Don't push me... don't push me! Sir, it's me... Sir, it's me! This is the only way... force him. The only way is to force him. Mr. Kwan, the police's looking for you. I suspect you for the robbery of an armoured truck. You may remain silent. Anything you say may be use against you in court. Take him away! Let's go! This computer is directly linked to the server from our head office. It contains confidential data of our clients. I request the presence of a lawyer. These two guys were friends of his since childhood. They're involved in the robbery. The only reason for the robbery, was because he lost a lot of money. Be careful with your implications. If your statement ruin the reputation of this company. I guarantee I'll sue you. If you help me, I will help you. He has some personal matters, you might want to know. I don't want to know anything. Don't want to know? Or you already know? I know love, can make a person blind sometimes. But you didn't lose your sense of smell did you? Can't you smell the blood on him? You're not afraid you might rub off some blood from him? If reputation really matters to you, you should help us find his motives. I'll wait for your call. You really are an expert. Calm Cautious Your acting skills pretty good too. You don't need to pick on me. You got to make this clear. I'm a cop. Is it because I defeated you? Or because you know, you'll never beat me? Why can't I beat you? Because... You even doubt your own instinct. You won't shoot... until the red dot is actually on the target. I'm not in your line of work, I don't take chances. What chances are you taking now? Is it necessary? Let me ask you, is it true that once you killed someone you get nightmares? Trying to use pressure on me? You better go and read some more books. People do have conscience Not everyone would kill... for the reason of survival. Do you have any conscience? If you have proof, you can charge me right away. There's no rush. You can sit here for awhile. Sir Time's up! You can go now. My speculation... Without any permission, 'He' utilized the company's account. But funds evaporated overnight, when financial crisis hit. Dug up a lot of holes for himself, but couldn't cover it at the end. Loosing the money wasn't his main concern, he couldn't face losing his reputation. Especially in front of the boss who got him to where he was. Then, there's this opportunity, Fong, a buddy who's working for another investment group came to him, claim he lost all his money in the stock market Another buddy Pang Toa, was pretty tight too. So the three worked out a scheme. One worked from the inside. The other did the hit. What a collaboration. You have no proof to connect me to the robbery. You're right. No witness and no evidence. I had nothing. Martin Goodman's book... was useless too. In that case, since you're so interested in psychology, maybe... let me try and help you make another guess. Sure Actually... 'He'... was only responsible... for selling the bonds. After the competition, didn't know if he's curious or worried, somehow he drove the car to the crime scene. A typical criminal behavior, being a culprit, there's a need to be in the 'action'. When he heard over the radio, there's a traffic accident nearby, initially, he was concern. But the chaos delayed the cops, from arriving at the location. It did him a favour. Don't move! Don't shoot! I told you not to move! Don't! Don't... Look at me! Calm down! Where's the stuff? Everything was going smoothly. But when he was just about to leave, he saw the 'inside' guy... nervously grabbed hold of a robber, yelling about something. He's afraid the cops will show up, so he got out of the car, forgetting that the three robbers, had no clue who he was. Toa! Watch it! Hey! Don't! He's the boss! Shut up! Just get out of here! Can't leave! I got recognized! Don't move! No! Are you guys crazy?! Crazy? I'll show 'crazy'! Don't... don't! You get out of here! Don't worry! Get back! Don't... Get back inside! Don't shoot! He didn't want anyone to die, but he couldn't subdue the robbers, so he went back to get his gun. Don't shoot! What are doing? Don't... Don't... Hey! Just go, I'll take care of things here. You take care of this? I'll take care of you! No, you can't, you can't kill him! He's my friend! He's dead even it's your Dad! Don't move! Drop your gun! He originally wanted to stop the robbers from killing, didn't expect the traffic cop to show up suddenly. The traffic cops was a good guy. He didn't want to get hit. So he moved aside. But the cop stopped his bike right in front of the robbers. Freeze! Officer, I've nothing to do with this... Get down! Run? Fong... Fong! Fong! Let's go! Mr. Kwan. I was at the Gun Club. You taught me how to shoot. Wait! What are you doing? No... I beg you, don't kill me... You were pretty calm. You thought of calling the police in such a short time, that established a solid evidence for you. It's 'Him'. If there's no other business, I'm leaving then. Wait... Wait a minute. Heavy rain that day, washed the body right out. This photo could be titled... 'Fate' He deserved it. What about me! Did I deserve to die too? Tell me! Did I deserve to die too! See you at the competition. Why did you touch my account? I'll say I lost all that money. So I'll get fired. I don't really care. All you had to do was to ask, you think I wouldn't help? Ken Just give it up. No matter what you've done, I'll pretend it never happened. As long as you're willing to leave her. I cannot hurt her. She's never ever hurt me before. Have I ever hurt you? You had nothing, it was me who helped you with your status! How can you treat me like this? You took away every opportunity I had. You object all the decision that I make. Buy Yen sell Yen, buy this, sell this... everything... Cause your decisions in general were all wrong. And you blame me for protecting you? It was for your own good! I just want my dignity back. Just reach for the goal that's all it matters. Dignity or no dignity, what's the use? Goodbye Ting I got everything done. We're leaving tomorrow. We'll go to Europe, then South Africa, then... get on a cruise in Argentina and head to South Pole, and then to Phuket. Forget it, we'll get on a flight tonight. I can't! Billy Tsui might be waking up. I got transferred over there. Why leave in such a hurry? What about the house? The furniture? The bank account? The house in Phuket isn't finished yet. So where're we going to live? You have to give me time to resign. Have to go. We'll talk later tonight. I'm sorry. I have to kill you again. He's brain dead. Family agreed to pull the ventilator last week. Do you need to be this inhumane? He's already in a coma. You want him killed again? I can't arrest him. This is my only chance. Are you a human being? Don't! Warren... Warren... listen to me... listen to me... Your brother is already dead. He was on his way to arrest those robbers. If he could, he would agree to this. Why can you leave him alone? Why are you against him? He lied to you all along. If you want to proof his innocence, all you have to say is Billy's waking up, then you'll know the truth. Why did you lie to me? He promised me he won't shoot. He'll say that you surrendered. You can leave your gun and come out. Or bring the gun out with you. Hope you don't make the wrong choice. You didn't find the targets. You lost. This is end of the competition. Unload and make clear. Are you ready? Don't! Oh, Miss Shaw, you're here. Chairman called and said you've great insight. Yen hit the roof. He said you're the only who dared to purchase. Hey... got fish here. Hey! Stop fiddling. Reel it in. Wow Ok So you won this time. Yeah, so what? You're right. If there's a duel between two sharp shooters. A second or so difference, doesn't mean a thing at all. Luckily I had the bullet proof vest on. I'm talking fishing. THE END
