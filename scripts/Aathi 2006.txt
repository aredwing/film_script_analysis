I never saw you here before. But I've been watching you for the past week. You were coming with your friends everyday. But today, you've come alone. Yes. Every moment we spend here is like a fresh dew drop. It's a heavenly feeling. - Right. Infact, I was waiting for this moment. What? CHENNAI Retd. DGP Shankar was shot dead... ...yesterday morning on the shores of Rameshwaram. Killers identity is still unknown. Police are trying to find the culprits. Special Task Force officer Mr. Pandian is sure to catch the killers. To participate in ASEAN meet, India's Prime minister... Uncle... - I'm Coming. What? - Uncle, I'm going to the college. Don't forget to take your medicine. I'll take care of that. Go, it's getting late to your college. The breakfast is in the hot-pack and coffee in the flask. - Okay. Another important thing. Don't add sugar to coffee after I leave. Okay. Anjali... be careful. Why are you looking at me? Is it because I'm beautiful than you? I'm beautiful from birth. Being beautiful is dangerous, right? Passing comments on me? You look very happy after coming from Rameshwaram. What's the matter? Ice cream please. - Here it is. When it rains, people take cover. But she gets wet in the rain and eats ice cream too. She is very unique. When it rains, she forgets everything. Come, let's have ice cream. Eating ice cream and getting wet in rain. No one other than you will have this kind of taste. Why not? Surely some one will be there. There must be at least 10 people who think & act just like me. If not 10, at least 1 . Definitely someone will come. Don't come near. Go. Stop. Stop. The train is coming. Boys, get out of the track. Stop. Are you mad? What's wrong with you? You're hale & healthy. I forgot to die in trying to save you. Why do you want to die? If I had told you this, would you have listened to me? I've too many problems. Yes, you may be true. But I'm neither here to solve your problems nor did I save you for that reason? There is no man without problems, and without problems, man is incomplete. To live in this world, everyone needs courage. You've lot of it. Courage to die. When you've the courage to die, why are you scared of facing your problems? Stand up against all odds, not only the train. That is courage. Have courage to live. It is easy to die, but to taste success, you must win. We must win. Boy, for that, will you take such a big risk? I won't mind taking risk if I like to do it. NEW DELHI I wear colourful dresses. But couldn't catch her attention. Only my tummy shrunk. I must take some risk. She is not looking at me. When did you come? When you were busy trying to catch her attention. Working out early morning! It is usual. Trying to trap her with your silly acts. Don't tell this to your mom. You look like an old man but very naughty. Thank you son. When you love her so much, why don't you talk to her? Let's sit & talk. Talk to her & maker her your concubine. It'll be good if it happens, right? - Yes. Your mom & that lady's husband must accept this. He has a sword with him always. Give me an idea. Any secret between father & son? I'm planning to get that aunty married to him. Feeling shy! First ask him to love me. Later he can try for other girls. Do you think I can't? Girls from all over India will fall for me. As if you are capable... I must do and then show her. Don't lose the tempo. I'll perform your marriage. Brother, are you getting married? Wrong. How can I marry when a senior is in the queue? Mani is going to get married. Congrats daddy. - Thank you dear. What Boss? Chatting? Who is the girl? Call me brother & not boss. Why shouldn't I when the entire state calls you the boss? You can't be reformed. Getting admitted in the Madras college? No. What are you going to do in Chennai leaving us here? Planning to stay alone? It's wrong to apply there without my permission. Why are you shouting? - Okay you shout. I can't. - Then, I'll shout. What do you think of yourself? A man? Where did you learn to disrespect your parents? Who gave this silly idea? Dad, you're over reacting. - Really? It is your good time he is just listening to you. If he starts shouting, you're gone. Be careful. You don't want us to question you, ah? No. I applied to have fun & enjoy. What's wrong here? Did we stop you from smoking, drinking or ogling at girls? Chennai people are eager to come to Delhi. But you want to go to Chennai. You don't know something, dad? He has lost interest in chatting. You're talking too much. Just shut up. Why should we live in two different places? Just 2 years. It'll go off in no time. So, you've decided to go. Then listen to our decision. If you go there, we'll come with you. What about that aunty? We'll see to that later. First go there & find a beautiful girl. Help. Please sir, help me. - Leave my hand. Please sir. Help me sir. How can they kill you in public? Don't get wet. Come inside. I'll take care of them. Sir... - Stop. How could you kill someone in public & broad daylight? Poor boy! What is his fault? Fault? Bloody scoundrel! They were not worried about the death of DGP in Rameshwaram. But they will telecast about the murder committed with RDX. Should I watch that silently? Now, I'm going to kill him. Let this be telecast live. Stop. Why do you unnecessary get into trouble? We came here to eke a living. Let us just do that. Everyone is looking at you. Even the police is nearby. But the police won't mind this. RDX can't be touched. Just try to understand the current world. Why do you get into trouble unnecessarily? What do you want to do now? I want to kill him. But one condition. - What is it? Abdullah, whoever comes in our brother's path, I'll kill them. That's it. Have you come to Chennai for vacation? No. We've come to buy Chennai. Are you interest to sell it? He is kidding me. Actually, he is venting his anger on you instead of me. I'm not angry. I don't like you all coming here for my sake. We are coming here because we don't want you to stay alone & suffer. But getting transferred for my sake is too much? Not just transfer, I won't even mind resigning my job. Looks like you love your son very much. What did you do in Delhi? Ogling at the aunty next door. It's enough. Stop it. I didn't tell you to stop. I didn't stop for you. Who is he? - RDX. It is a bomb. You need to lit fire to blow a bomb. But his very look will blow up the place. Is he the ruling party's M.P.? He is the backbone of all parties. Only such people are called as national leaders. Wait. Brother has to come. Started again? He'll never change this stupid act. He'll not change. And he won't come till the rain stops. As the rain pours, our souls start to sing. As we dance, the music of joy overflows. The flowers get wet in the rain, the heart gets cooled. the earth melts, and the joy multiplies, to speak the language of desires. O rain! Come & pamper me. O rain! My heart yearns for you. O rain! Come closer. O rain! Cuddle me & go away. When you touch me, you're a friend. Bring love in your every drop. Pamper me... My heart yearns for you... O rain! Come & pamper me. O rain! My heart yearns for you. O rain! Come closer. O rain! Cuddle me & go away. AYNGARAN DVD Every drop of rain unfolds it's desires when it falls on us. As I get wet, shyness engulfs me. Plant a kiss with your drop of rain, O cloud! My hands embraces you. Weaves love for you. Come & buzz around me. Rain drop, so beautiful, rain drop, so magical,' O rain! Come & pamper me. O rain! My heart yearns for you. AYNGARAN DVD Since you pour in my threshold, should I call you the queen of generosity? Since you caress my closed eyes, should I cajole you as a child? As you fondle me around, as I merge in you, Will you be my pampered child? Like a white fire, like a flower filled with shyness, will you adore me? The rain drop so close to my heart, the rain drop, so mythical, and as it touches me, I'm in ecstasy. O rain! Come & pamper me. O rain! My heart yearns for you. O rain! Come closer. O rain! Cuddle me & go away. When you touch me, you're a friend. Bring love in your every drop. Pamper me... My heart yearns for you... Who is Bullet here? Who is Bullet here? Stop staring & tell me. Who is Bullet here? Tell me. Who is Bullet here? Where is he? Tell me, who is Bullet here? - It's me. So, you are Bullet. - Yes boss. Such a big stick to hit you? - Throw it down. Are you a rowdy? - Nothing like that. What do you mean by that? - Let's not fight in the college. If not in college, shall we fight outside? - Yes. Bullet. I didn't name myself. Tamil Nadu people gave me this title. My shoe is Reebok. But I'm a rogue. This is Bullet speaking. Send an ambulance to City RDX college. Can't you see me talking? Then why do you disturb me? Over. Put them in the ambulance. Get inside... I'll rip you apart. Thank you very much. You said you'll hit us lightly, but you kicked us all. Since this was my first fight, I was a bit emotional. Please don't mind that. As I promised, take Rs.10000. Take it & go away. But you hit us a lot. Shouldn't I hit an extra large body of yours? I'm a small boy. Please forgive me. Why does a small boy need a chain? I bought this from Nathella Sampathu Chetty. What Nathella? - Get lost. Listen. RDX rules the city, and I rule this city college. Friends, I'm everything in this college. If you listen to me, you won't have any problem. Please go to your classes. Here goes the Bullet and I'll come if there's any problem. Should I tell you separately? Go to your class. It is my phone. - Phone? Is this your phone? Come on, try to touch it. Touch it... ...and I'll rip you apart. Saw what had happened? - Yes I saw. When you went inside the ambulance, I saw the chain. But when you came out, I found the chain missing. The wounded asked money for hospital expenses. So, I gave him the chain. Because I know to hit as well as to love. I heard you speaking Rs. 5000 & Rs.10000...? He praised me that I'm 1 among 10000. I asked him to go. I've come across many people. But never a joker like you. Why are you calling me a joker? When I've the sim card, how could you talk on the phone? This is okay. But how did you know ambulance internal matter? This is called as baiting to trap. Bye. Hi! - Hi! Offering flowers to Buddha? - Why not? Those who know about Buddha won't offer him flowers. I don't know about that. But I'll never give up this. Is this also included in your childish behaviour? It's your fate. Sign here. Madam. - Give it to me... Anjali, let's go... Hello Mister, sign here and go... Oh Supreme power!... Oh Goddess!.... Oh heavenly goddess... You please take your seat. You please carry on your work. After hearing your name in college yesterday, I've forgotten myself. Which name? Supreme power! Goddess Angala Parameswari... wasn't that your name? How can I explain you? In this modern world, they keep short and sweet names. You have kept such a divine name! Never go with ugly girls... Please... Akhilandam... Oh no! My name is Anjali. Really? Is your name Anjali? Name of the heroine in the film 'Agninakshatram'. You're coming from Adambakkam using 2 trains and 3 buses?! Great interest in pursuing studies. No... I'm coming from T. Nagar, Agraharam street... It's nearby only. Is it so? Then, who dropped you on bike today? Is he your lover? - Oh no! I don't love anyone... - Thanks! For what? If I ask your details, you'll refuse to tell me. That's why... now you're caught! Anjali... Coming from T.Nagar, Agraharam street... Special note: You still haven't fallen in love. Oh god! Don't mistake me... Yesterday I saw you in the rain... You too were eating ice cream in the rain & playing with friends. I started liking you immediately... I have a sister. she used to chide me always... Saying "No one will have such a bad taste". I got so excited after seeing you having similar taste. That's why I thought of having an intro... Are you saying she's a mad girl? You please shut your mouth. I'll introduce my sister to you. Nothing more... It's all just for fun. Don't take it seriously. See you then... Sister, bye... Kuttima, clap your hands... That's it! Shit! You stupid! It's all gone! Who is that goddess? What? Here is Goddess Lakshmi! She is our family goddess... I meant the goddess of your University. As soon as she appeared, you started worshipping her... I'm referring to that... Did this devil tell you? Did you come to this place only to see her? Oh no! Don't talk rubbish. We both have similar tastes. I just shared this with her... To hell with your useless taste! Getting drenched fully in the rain, and having ice cream... Did you invite her for a romantic duet song? Is it fair? You were after a college girl... don't you feel ashamed? Excuse me... Your husband fell at women's feet to flatter them. I'm not of that type. Forget it. What else did you talk then? I just told her that I like her. That's all! Thanks boss! We just wanted to know how that girl entered your college. Oh god! Please leave me! Is she beautiful? Yes. She is smarter than me! Ask him to bring her home... My son, can you bring her here once? Oh god! What's all this? Fantastic family! It's nothing like as you think... Will you all please shut up? Let's see we'll keep quite or you'll get floored by her. Hey, why are you wearing dupatta for your dress? Get lost man! - Now a days, this isn't a fashion. Yesterday your parents would've asked about Anjali, haven't they? How do you know that? I told your sister! Including this photo! Why man? This is my timely help to you! Good morning... Who is he? Is he a Lecturer? We can see him here often... He may be a Chairman. Good man! He is friendly with everyone. Infact, girls like him very much. This world has both good and bad things! This is the philosophy of the world. A good person is also here, along with you liar! Hi Geetha, how are you? How is your studies going on? What are you doing? Taking photos? You show this photo to everyone! Send your photos! Take your sisters' photos... Are you boss of this place? Are you a big boss? Fair looking! If you dress neatly... Will you become a gentleman? Look, appearance isn't important... Your character should be good! Why did you stop here? Japanese found bikes, we found the custom of worshipping it. Let's have a small prayer for it. Why now? Just for the safety of the vehicle. Aren't you bothered about your safety then? I pray for my safety also... Aren't you bothered about your vehicle then? I pray for both! Aren't you bothered about the driver of opposite vehicle? He too must have prayed for his safety. How do you know about that? Let him do anything... Is it important now? Let's pray for our safe journey! Now... the vehicle... which is coming opposite to us... - Stop it man! To offer a single coconut for the vehicle, you're questioning me like an Income Tax Officer! No need to pray and offer coconut! I don't need this bike! Leave me! I know my way! He is also affected! Bullet never walks! Hey, get me a new bike! Sir, come with me... Looks like very old... No. It's a new one. - I didn't refer your bike! 'Bullet' going on a moped is a historical event! Note it down! Take this biscuit. - I want only chocolate. Please dear... - No. I want only chocolate. This is a good biscuit. Have it. It tastes good. Wow! Sun Feast Milky Magic! Thank you uncle. Bye... Is it our Aathi? Yes. He is our Aathi! Why is he sitting there? Has he started visiting temples? Can't you wear half-saree while visiting a temple? She is a small girl... Father, I told you about Bullet showing me a photo, right? Here is that girl! Oh! Is it she who inspired him to come here? Hi... You... Have you forgotten me so soon? Yesterday in the college... Didn't you ask me to forget everything? So I've forgotten you! Have you come to offer prayers or offering? - I'm not used to it. Mr. Mani?! How come you are here?! Sir, I should've asked that. Are you going to exchange garlands or register your marriage? She is my friend. They are my parents. Civil Engineer. She is a home maker. She is my sister. - Hi... Oh! Is she the one who commented about our tastes? Since you both have similar tastes, it got synced! What got synced?! - Chatting... dating... What do you mean? Stop it Mani! He is talking about our friendship... Did he tell about us? - No. You don't know anything about us... But we know everything about you! Everything means? Queen of confusion! Please be quiet! It's getting late for you... please go... Hey, wait... What is your name? - Anjali. God bless you. Hereafter you are also a member of our family. Don't fail to come to our house. To your house? Why? Won't you come to our house? I'll come definitely. I like the girl very much. Let's fix the marriage on the next auspicious time... Oh god! Mani... can't you keep quiet? Oh god! Bullet, a man beat me. Does he know that you're my man? He beat me severely only after knowing it. Even after knowing my power, someone has dared to beat you! I want to see him now! Where is our gang? Yes sir. - Bullet has left! Bullet, he is the one who had beat me! Bullet, what happened? Why are you keeping quiet? I'm not ready to talk to a poor man. History will belittle me. You ask him. Did you beat our man? Yes. He has accepted his mistake. Let's go. Hey, wait men... Who is Bullet here? Boss, tell him that you're Bullet! - No! The one who doesn't know Bullet, isn't a gangster at all! I don't talk to ordinary people! Let's go! Hey, will you come here or should I come to you! Hey, listen man! If you chew, it's chicklet! If you buy to eat, it's cutlet! The one who knocks you is Bullet! Hey... Bullet, don't ever step backward! Then shall I take a side-step? Bullet should never become a zero! Show your true colour to him! Hey... why did you stop me? - Oh god! At a time, I'll show you all my power! Why did you stop me? Tell me... tell me man... Hey, stay back... don't step further... I'll first finish them and then I'll rip out your skin! I'll be silent to a certain limit... If I get angry, I'll flow out like a beer! Who is supporting him? Tell me... Get up men... get up... Has he gone? - Yes... Has he really gone? - Yes, Bullet. Don't worry. I'll buy a quarter and a chicken biryani for you. On your account! Whenever I try to act smart, he is coming at the right time! It's better to avoid him. Come, let's go... Hello... - Hello... Oh! Is it you? I always find you in the library. Do you love books? I like library very much. - Oh is it so? I too like library very much. Should great people only like library? Shouldn't we like it? Truly I like it! It's a thrilling experience to meet people with similar tastes, isn't it? Yes! Anyway, I'm Aathi... You're Anjali, right? Today you seem to be in a jolly mood... That day you felt shy in the temple...? It's all because of you! My parents used to tease everyone in the town. Specially my friends! My parents are like my friends. But it will be delicate to the people, meeting them for the first time. You too faced the same thing, didn't you? No. I also like friendly parents. Again same taste! Are your parents also friendly with you? They were! Sorry Anjali. I remembered them and hurt you! How can I forget them?! I always remember their absence. Does your father like you crying? Does your mother like you worrying? Does your family like to see you sad? They won't, will they? Then why are you like this? Look Anjali, our relations are dead, not their relationships. They are always with us! Always watching us! Only if we are happy, their souls will rest in peace. You just smile and see... You can see your mother! You just feel happy... You can see your father! If you are happy, then your entire family will be happy! Tell me now, don't you have any other family members? Yes. Oh friends! This is the latest philosophy! Please heed my words! Is there a crack in the sky? Is there a sad breeze? Then why should we feel sad? Everyone has problems... We should tackle and overcome them. Don't you have a sky to fly high? Babe, Oh my babe! Don't worry. We make merry! Babe, Oh my babe! Don't worry. We make merry! Oh friends! This is the latest philosophy! Please heed my words! AYNGARAN DVD There is only one moon and one sun! We have got only one life! Let's live! Take fragrance out of flowers! Take fire from lamp! Everything is for good. Analyse it. There is hot summer and cool winter. This is what we learn from the nature. We can learn many things from our joys and sorrows! If you learn to balance them, you will always have peace! When you heed your conscience, you will never go wrong. Babe, Oh my babe! Don't worry. We make merry! Babe, Oh my babe! Don't worry. We make merry! Oh friends! This is the latest philosophy! Please heed my words! AYNGARAN DVD Stop it... Dancing here? Come home... Dancing there? Dance here! AYNGARAN DVD Keep singing, you will find new tunes! Keep running, Your track will fast! Keep swimming, you will find the shore. Everything depends on us!

Anjali, it's been a long time since I saw you smiling. You should smile always like this! No uncle. I can be happy only after they are dead. This is the right time for that. RDX never gives up anything he likes. He's eyeing a big complex in Chennai. Scared of taking on RDX, Owner Sulaiman sold the property to RDX's sworn enemy Pattabi, and left this city. RDX won't spare him alive. Tomorrow both the gangs will fight it out. In that melee we must gun down Abdullah or Sada. Hey, ask all of them to come out of the shop... They won't... They will... They won't... This place belongs to Pattabi. Now this place belongs to RDX. I'm the boss of this place... It can never happen. It will happen... It can never happen. I'll see how it happens! Hey, wait... We should kill RDX! First let's kill Abdullah and Sada... Are you all planning to kill me? S.I. Moorthy, are you here? Hey, Pattabi, please sit down. Do you want to kill me? You will plan for it... I always interfere in all your deals... If I was in your position, I'll also do the same. I'll have the same idea! Because you are criminals to the core. We are just green horns, aren't we? How can you bear me? You will get angry! You like to kill, don't you? Like this, if you cut... they will be dead! First you should be a man to rule the world! If you want to kill a man... just kill him! Just like this! Locking horns with me?! You should strike the right spot! If your men get scared of me, and cut my hand instead of neck... and if I survive the attack... Then.. I'll definitely kill you! Got it? Perfect! Very good! If you place it at the right place, then you will get blown up! Not only the man you aim, People surrounding for 500 metres will perish! One of us should own that complex. 30 seconds... Why this violence and bloodshed? I'm fed up of this life. Let's die together! At least people will have peace. 20 seconds... Instead of after each other's life all our entire lives... We'll die in 5 seconds... 5 seconds... Give me the pen... Take it! Understood my power now? Now I can easily kill you. I hate killing people. But you should be alive! I need an enemy like you! Only then, I'll know my value! Your troubles keep my mind sharp! Otherwise it will become dull! There is no point in playing without the opponent! Now you are a wastrel! See you! Pattabi, if you want to kill me, plan perfectly. If you don't know, just make a call! A new party is rises in Tamil Nadu. What is this? We have more parties than people! Mind your work. Hey, wait... why are you going silently? Nothing... What is that? - Just a small wound... Then why did you use a band-aid? Mother, why are you getting tensed? There was a small problem in the complex. What man? Why did you interfere in that? Mani, Anjali got trapped in that problem. I got wounded while saving her.. that's all. There he is! When heroine is in trouble, he became a hero! Stopped with wounds or, went to a movie, park etc.? Yes! I love Anjali. She is my life! I'm going to marry & live with only her. Is it enough? Brother... You shut up! Brother, Anjali... What? It's all because of you only! Oh no! Just now Anjali came here and left... What have you done, Mani? What will she think about me? - What did I do? Please keep quiet. - He spoke some romantic stuff She felt shy & went away. There is no such thing between us. So, there are other things between you both. I didn't ask you details. We can discuss that later. Hello... didn't she come there? Where were you till now? At least you could've made a phone call. I phoned to many people to find you. We must kill them. We must kill them. When I see them, I get very angry. What happened Anjali? Uncle, we shouldn't delay this any more. We must kill them & move. I can understand you anger. Our haste shouldn't become an advantage to them. We will surely kill them. - When? It isn't easy to kill RDX. Yesterday, if Aathi hadn't saved you... It's giving me shivers. You must live happily... I can't lose you taking hasty decisions. We will move only after seeing their death. Our next plan shouldn't fail. Friend... Aathi. Is it a new bike? Did you buy this bike? - I stole the bike. Stealing is my business. Stop joking. It's true. I wanted to ride such a bike for a very long time. There was no one around. I stole the bike. Say this to any drunkard. I won't believe you. This is a new bike. Fearing I may ask a treat, you are lying. You won't believe me. Take this. You'll understand. - Okay. You move. Let me play. What bike is this? It's big like a pregnant bullock. One wheel is at north pole and the other is at south pole. How to ride this bike? They have re-modelled a water lorry with some steel accessories. Boss..! If you want to go for a round, I'll take you. Hey, this is my bike. - Your bike...? What's your last price for it? Are people watching us? - No. Then, hit me once. All the best. Keep it up. Aathi, I can't understand you. I can't understand myself. Saw Anjali? No.You're looking for Anjali to propose to her, right? I'm looking for her to say that I don't love her. We don't need address...! Hey, move...Greetings. Your name is Solam, but you're living a luxurious life. 4 pilot cars, 40 security guards. Wonderful life! It's all your mercy. - Come & sit here. For a meagre salary of Rs. 5000, they are so faithful to you. I made you a Minister. How faithful you should be to me! What are you talking, Boss? Tell me what do you want. I just came to talk to you. Here? Garbage, slush... Let's sit in the car. It's an A/C car. We are from this place, right? It's been very long since we spoke sitting on the platform. Order 2 teas. Have it. Clear the traffic. Traffic... - Just shut up. Why did you take the pain to see me? A phone call is enough, I would've come to you. Sitting in this place...? I took you from this place, and made you a Minister from a low level party worker. That's a golden period. Want to go back again? What are you talking boss? You know Abdullah & Sada... They both are... - Your eyes. They both are like sickles. They are my weapons. I've never said 'No' to them. - I know. I'm not interested in 5 years of power. I want power for lifetime. But he wants to be an MP like you. You could have told me this. Why trouble him? This is not a big issue. You said the same thing last time too. - Really? You also promised to get me the highways contract. Did I promised that also? Okay, I'll finish it. MP seat for him and contract for him. They must get it. You're getting it for them. Hi Anjali! - Hi! Why did you leave without dropping into my house? You were hurt yesterday. I came to see you. Did you think I would be on bed for this wound? I saw. You were in a very romantic mood. Sorry Anjali. - For what? When you came to our house, I shouldn't have spoken like that. If I were you, I would've also done the same thing. Actually, I must thank you. For me being so romantic? No. For saving my life. It would've been nice if you had come home & said this. No. It wouldn't be nice to come at that time. No matter when you come, my family will be like that only. My family is a kingdom. I'm their king & whoever speaks to me is the queen. They think that way. - So be it. First, you resign. Both you & people want me to resign. What can I do? If you're not able to do what we asked for, what's the use of you being a Minister? Did you forget that this Minister post is our brother's mercy? What can I do? It's all the handiwork of Pattabi. He is very close to the Central Minister. He doesn't care about not getting the MP seat & the tender or not, he doesn't want you to get those projects. Till he is around there, we can't do anything. Trust me. I won't cheat you. If you can, kill him first. What are you talking? Don't you know our strength? First kill him! Hey, sit man! Don't lose your temper... Let's first get permission from our boss. Will he deny us? We must have killed him in that complex fight itself. Tomorrow I'll kill him in his place! After that I'll meet our boss! You stay here... Uncle, be careful! You've missed it! I want Pattabi before dawn! Who killed Sada? I don't know! Definitely Pattabi didn't kill him. Who did it in a wink's time? RDX has many enemies. Definitely one of them would've done it! I missed the chance of killing him! Friend, why are you worried? Aathi, have you ever seen me crying? I cried when I was 4, after that I'm crying now. Why? What happened? Sada was shot dead. How is he connected to you? Aathi! Thank god, no one heard this! Sada was controlling North Madras, and South Madras was my domain. Both of us were giving the police a tough time. Now Sada is dead... I've lost company! Is it? How did they kill him? How can I explain you? It's a big story! A group of enemies fired shots at him... I didn't stay quiet... Before I could collect those fired bullets and reload them... They shot dead Sada! But I've a plan to kill them... One day... What will you do? I will show it in action! Do it... You are innocent... go to class! It's all big man's job. Hey, I killed Sada! Look, since I'm upset, don't try to make me laugh. Go to your class. Trust me, I killed him with this. Oh god! Show me your left hand... Your right hand... Hey, get 2 teas for us... go... - Okay boss! Aathi, hereafter, don't show magic in front of boys... Because, only now I've become rowdy and bossing over them... I'm trying to expand my level... Don't spoil it! Stop your show-off here. If you do this in RDX's market area, He will immediately come to know about you... And you can lead a more comfortable life than this! Thank you Aathi! Where? Sada is dead. How dare you open the shops? Before I destroy your shops, down your shutters. Bullets works for RDX. And will do anything he says. Where are you going? To meet RDX. - For what? To say that I killed Sada and you are the witness. Going to fix me up...? Take your places. Sorry Sada. I should've done this earlier. I killed Sada. I'll also kill Abdullah. You need a knife to kill. But my hand itself is a knife. I killed Sada. I'll also kill Abdullah. Yes... yes... yes... He is the real man. A real man. He is my perfect enemy. This is an open challenge. Playing with real men is what makes the game interesting. Brother, who is he? He is no ordinary man. A lion. In his eyes, I saw wrath not just anger. Madness to kill! That lion has challenged to kill you too. Kill me...? Bloody... Before he kills me, I'll chop him to pieces and throw it on Sada's grave. And you'll see this happen. Those eyes & hands... He has killed both of my tigers! He has killed them in a busy area... Can't you identify him? You search him everywhere... You bring him here like Police dogs searching for the corpse... Go... go fast... Father... Now I've to reveal the truth... - What are you going to say? Infront of me, you chopped a man's head! What more is there to say? Forgive me father! Aathi, what's all this? Father, that is... - Stop it... don't explain me anything! Let's leave this place... - No father... Since you've killed a criminal, no one identified you to the police. But if RDX knew that you've killed them... He will never spare you alive! Please come... let's leave this place! Hey, let's go! - I won't! Till I finish all of them, I won't leave this place! Because... I came here to kill them! My son can't be a murderer! Mother, I'm not your son! Forgive me, mother! When you met me as a child, I told I was an orphan, didn't I? That was a lie! I had everyone! My present college library was my house long back! My lovable parents... My uncle and aunty who tolerated all my mischief... My uncle's daughter who repeats all my actions... I had many relatives... Above all, my beloved grandpa... My family was like a pleasant and beautiful garden! Hey, you may fall... Brother, what are you doing? If you want, you can also join... Hubby, why are you behaving like a child? There won't be any problem! Hey, be careful! He may fall... Oh no! It's paining... - Hubby... Brother, didn't I tell you? Are you okay? - He is fine... You should be very careful while playing with the children. I was. But he slipped... To hell with your play! I didn't do it purposely... Hubby, you are very careless... You too started scolding me...? Brother, what have you done? Poor children! Did I do it purposely? Brother-in-law, why did you do so? What I did?! I was just... Brother-in-law, you always behave like this! They only asked me to lift them up, so I did it... Did we? You only called us... Did I? - Yes! Okay! First all of you finish scolding me. Then I'll open my mouth. Dad, nothing happened to us... Then why are you creating a scene? Usually we get scolding from you... Today I just wanted you to get scolded by all of us! That's it! Children did this for fun... Then why all of you joined them? Did you all have so much vengeance on me? Greetings sir! They call me RDX. Please sit down... Sister, please sit down... It's been a long time since we had home food! Dear, what are you looking at? I'm also hungry. Serve me food... Sir, I don't have any property other than this house! I also didn't find any place other than this for my complex. What did we ask you... Hey Oldie, we just asked to give your home to us... Are you complaining about us to the A.C.? Hey, give respect to his age... Your money won't be sufficient to run my family... Sir, first tell me your problem... I've to perform my elder grandchild's marriage... Problem is solved! Next... Younger one... Boss, stop it... Why? She is a poor little girl... Child sentiment?! No... poor young girl... That's it! Oh god! Father, save my daughter... Grandpa... grandpa... Pathetic situation! These scenes are not for people of your age. Didn't I warn you? You never listened to me! Look there... your grandchild is helpless... All that is left with middle class is honour, Now you've lost that also... From now on, property belongs to RDX! Don't want... listen to me... I'll manage... you go... Robert, don't worry about me. You go and take shelter in the Minister's house... I'll manage this... Go... go fast... Hey, what do you think of a Minister? Getting tensed for silly things! We are the ruling party! Why are you fearing an A.C.P? Don't worry. I'll take care of everything! Good morning sir... Come on man... Hey, ask him what he wants? What are you thinking man? What do you want? - I want him! What are you going to do with him? Demand for your promotion... I'll give you... I want only him! Hey, he is my man! Sir, he raped a little girl! Forget it man! Young man... got into a mood... You should've sent your wife to him! Hey, mind your words! I'm clear. I know you're a traitor! I know you are the leader of these scoundrels! What man! Crossing your limits...? I can... - What can you do man? You know only to do boss over in front of these cheap men! You are unaware of an A.C.'s power! You don't know about me! - Who are you man? Are you the god? Are you god if you belong to the ruling party? If you win every time, will that make you an MGR? or wearing specs make you Karunanidhi? Who are you man? Our country is still backward, because of you wastrels... Only because of you people, rowdies are becoming leaders... and all criminals are ruling over us! What man... giving a big lecture? Yes! I only promoted these rowdies... I did all illegal things with the help of them! I'll continue doing it. What can you do? You're here only to salute & guard us. No. Listen to me. No. He killed the Minister for not giving him protection. Please arrest him. Why are you tensed now? You can't control him! It's possible only by one matter... What is it? - Sentiments. Family sentiments. Who are you? I'm RDX... It means... - It's not a bomb... People call me like that. What do you want? My group includes me, my brother, Sada and Abdullah. We indulge looting, arson and murders. And are eking our livelihood... That is our profession. Why are they interfering in that? Shouldn't we live our lives? Who are you man? Greetings sir! I've come to see you... Nothing serious... Sir, your son has arrested my brother and my men. They should be released... That is my humble request... I know you can do this... If you tell a word to him, A.C. will heed you. Yours is a big family... You are all very kind hearted people... Innocent children... You can't bear a death in your affectionate family! Killing people is like a game for me. I've told what I want to... I leave it to your choice. Without knowing our power, you are talking big... Please go away... He will be coming now... If he sees you here, he won't spare you alive! Hey... Now watch... who is going to die... There they are! They are bravos! My family is unaware of the word 'fear'! They are more than enough to finish you! Take him away! Father, what's all this? Is this the way you bring them up? What can I do? All behave like you!
