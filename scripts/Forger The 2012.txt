I just knew I didn't belong. II was just some loser kid who ended up here. IBy mistake, sort of. IYou know, I read somewhere that nothing is so beautiful IThat it can't be ugly if you look really close. II can't remember who said it, IBut whoever it was got it right. That's a good painting, kid. Really. Thanks. Can't even see the numbers. How much you, uh... how much you want for that? Fifty bucks. Fifty bucks? I would've paid double for that. - Here. - Hey! You, kid! What are you doing? What are you doing with my painting? Wait a minute... hey! - What the...? - Looks good, huh? Yeah, Id say it looks good, I did it. You in there? Are you in there? I let you stay for more than a week. I want you out of here, now. Hang on! I've got your money! - I feel bad after kicking him out. - Yeah. He was here for a whole week and never paid. - Really? - I never did see his mom around. What do you think he was, Well, that's why I called you. Wait till you see what he did to my room. Hm... what a mess. No, not that... that. - I have a hundred point assignment due. - Hey! Picasso! See you later. Got any more paintings for sale? You're the kid who sold the painting at the mission, right? Yeah. How did you hear about that? It's a small town. Right. That's a nice outfit, by the way. Thank you. It's required. Thank god. I was beginning to think your grandma dressed you. - Really? - Hm-Mm. Well, I had no idea anyone still thought heavy metal was cool, so... No, no. See, black flag is punk rock, okay? - Oh. - Yeah. And Im supposed to take the word of a con man, huh? Look, Im not a con man, okay? I painted that painting. Well, part of it, kind of. How old are you? - Freshman? - No, Im in tenth grade. - Hm. - Well, I should be in tenth grade. I'm... see, Im working on that. I don't think you can talk your way out of this one. Amber, what are you doing? Didn't you hear the tardy bell? Hm? - Did it ring? - Yes, it did ring. - I didn't hear it. - Really? Okay, you know what, are you being sarcastic with me? - No. - No. Okay, you know what, let's go. And young man, I don't know what you're doing, But you should be in school. It's after 1:00 p. M. Okay? - I'm going. - Yeah, you're going to the principal's office. - And Ill tell you why... - Hey, hey, buddy, look. She said she's going to class, just give her a break. You know what, young man? I don't wanna have to call the police, okay? So thank you very much. Take care. You know, why don't you pick on somebody else? What did you say? You hang around with trash like this? - Okay, that's it, that's it, we're going right now. - Ow! - You need to listen and respect... - Okay. You don't need to drag me. No, I am not dragging you. You just need to respect the school. It's very simple. Hey! I said cut her a break, would you? Hold on, son... ...over the line here. You're out of line. - Are you okay? - Yeah. - You need to leave. - What's up, did you push her? No, I didn't push her. This guy grabbed her arm, he's nuts. Get outta here, you kook! I was just trying to make sure she was all right. - Well, you did that. - Are you okay? Yeah, Im fine. - Get back, let's go back. - Looks like a bum. - Aram, come on. - Aram... - he looks like a homeless dude. - Hey, let's get outta here, come on. - Back to school... - Get as far away as possible. Okay? - Watch me! - Hey! Huh? What now? Huh? Huh? Huh? - Huh? - Hey! You've gotta stop, we've gotta go. Come on, guys. Who was that guy? - I don't know. - Let's go. Back to class. I'm sorry! - You all right? - Yeah. Hello? Hello? No way. Fifteen-Year-Old juvenile, burglary. Well, if that's all, Mr. Campbell... check his pockets while you got him. See if he's got some cash to pay for all this damage. Everly, you have a call. Give us a call if you find anything else. Believe me, you'll be the first to hear about it. I can't believe we got druggies running around - In this neighborhood. - It's an urgent call. All right. Excuse us. What did you do, Bernie? Wasn't me. How did this happen? - I think it was the boy. - The boy? Are you kidding me? We only had half a rough version. The boy? Well, it wasn't the maid. You haven't answered my question. In 20 minutes. What about the next case? What about it? Doesn't it deserve your attention, too? I give every person who walks through that door my full attention. So, did your mother give you any indication where she was headed - When she, uh... when she decided to... - What? Leave me? Look, she didn't even bother to say goodbye. Do you really think she told me where she was going? Joshua, are you an only child? - What does the file say? - It's incomplete. Yeah, well, sounds like me. I know you know art, but you seem unaware of my more provocative work. Major publications have said my art harkens back To the work of the original bohemian masters who founded this community. And that's a quote. So what did I do to earn this reputation? I took what the world of art describes as a master style And I combined it with my own interpretation of the intense beauty Of the natural world around me. The lady from child services is on the phone. Bernie, Im not finished. They don't speak any English. Geez... I don't want to sound negative, but as we said on the phone earlier, You're probably wasting your time coming down here. - We have a whole process involved. - I understand. And I came here, despite what you said, Because I was really hoping you might reconsider my offer. You have a big heart, offering your home to this kid. You know, I wasn't... I wasn't exactly the straightest arrow myself. I... I think I understand what this boy's going through. Well... he has a record. I'm prepared to drop all the charges. Well, I did talk to him this morning. I mean, he's not a threat or anything. He's 15 years old. He's been through enough as it is. We do emergency placements, but only in extreme circumstances. What you're asking for is definitely not standard procedure. This would be almost impossible to get past a judge. Let me worry about that. I've played enough rounds on pebble beach with these local judges, you know? Look, Ms. Reese, Im an artist myself. I was very much like this kid. Scared, lost. The only thing that stopped me from falling into the hole That I was rapidly digging for myself was my talent. It saved me. It helped me to be somebody. - And Joshua, he has that talent. - I'm not gonna bend the rules. Ms. Reese, would you really uphold a rule, Even when you knew it wasn't in the boy's best interests? You don't like lox? Is it... is it fish? - Bernie, get the kid some waffles. - Waffles? Or whatever it is kids eat. I got you a little gift. Try it. Yeah, it feels nice. That's not all you can do with that, is it? Well, you know, I have done some reading on a couple of artists. One named Da Vinci. He was really good at drawing. Another guy named Picasso. But you know, one of my big favorites... ...this guy named Hank Ketcham. Ketcham? I don't know this artist. He is the creator of Dennis the menace. I like this kid, I like him. Dennis the menace. That's not bad. - So it's good. - I didn't say it was good, I said it was not bad. The judge asked me to house you in the hope that you might benefit From some tutelage from me. Personally, I think you're a born loser who's gonna squander his talent Before he realizes its full potential. Wow. That was some motivational speech. Do you have any idea what great things a professional art career Can give you in your life? And I care about that because...? I" Walking on a dream " A person dedicated to their craft can have toys like this. I" Talking to myself " I" Will I see again? " People need to figure out... how to find their success. And don't believe that success is a luxury. It's a necessity. Trust me. You must be new on the charity event circuit. Oh, yeah. This is a very poor use of canvas. Unless it's yours, in which case it's... in which case? Oh... Everly will be disappointed in your analysis of his new work. - Anne-Marie, how nice to see you. - Hello, Everly. I see you've met our young artist-In-Residence? We chatted. - Anne-Marie, Joshua mason. - Hello, josh. So, what were you talking about? Me, I hope. Oh, actually, we were. Yes, Joshua was just giving a very astute analysis of your new work. Well, he is very bright. And I feel a lot of this work is very strong. I mean, I think Im entering a special phase in my career. - Special is the word. - Thank you. Oh, Ive just seen the mayor, will you excuse me? Well... it was nice meeting you, Anne-Marie. Likewise. Ryan. - Joshua. - Nice to meet you, josh. My sister told me the whole story. I jumped in the other day without knowing what was really going on. Man, you got a mean left hook. Ooh. Sorry about that. Hey, you know, your shots were pretty good, too. I was feeling that the next day. Hey, thanks for backing up my sister. It means a lot. No problem. So, what are you doing here? I just... I love hanging out with old people. Or... two great minds... think alike. I saw you talking to Anne-Marie. What was that all about? Nothing. She's just some crazy old lady. This town's, like, full of them. She's actually one of the pretty cool ones. - For how famous she is. - Really? Yeah. She's crazy rich. The word is, she keeps tons of cash. That little art studio by the beach, - It's like a little cottage down there. - Yeah. Yeah. Huh. II don't really remember what I was looking for. IMaybe it was the money. IAt least that would've gotten me out of that crazy place. What are you doing here? Nothing... what have you got there? His name was George. He brought art into this town. But he didn't have the strength to stay alive in it. Why do you have a picture of him? Well, he was very close to my family. Very talented and very lost. - Oh, your ride's here. - Is it the police? Everly. You live with him, right? Not by choice. Oh... Im so sorry about this, Anne-Marie. Oh, not to worry. I appreciate your understanding. Come on. Why is he living with you? Oh, Ive taken him on as a kind of live-In art student. It's an alternative work program. I had no idea you'd become so philanthropic. Well, you know, we all try to do... ...whenever we can. Hey, Vanessa? Um, a Ms. Cole is here to see you. Hi, Ms. Cole. Oh, yes, Im here about Joshua mason. - We spoke on the phone. - Great. Well, have a seat. - Oh, thank you. - Yeah. No, I was just... you know, Wanted to make sure that he was all right. Well, Ive got him in a wonderful home. - He's in great hands. - Uh-Huh. - Yeah. - Good. Oh... what a wonderful piece. - You have an interest in art? - Oh, well, a little bit. But Ive always loved children's art. It doesn't matter who they are or what they've seen, they use it all. - Wonderful. - Well... ...let me show you something else. Look at these. Oh... powerful stuff. - Are these his? - They are. Those were taken in the motel room where his mother abandoned him, - But Im not allowed to talk about the details. - Well... no, I respect your need for privacy. I'm a private person myself. But I do have to tell you one thing. Keep your eye on Everly. He's not right for this. It's too much for a kid to handle. He's 15, he has pimples. I'm not even sure his voice has broken. He probably thinks the impressionists are a heavy metal band. He's talented, but he's a risk. We need to find someone else to do the Winslow Homer - And dauphine his money now. - What other choice do I have? Leeway is dead, Bernie. He's dead. He did 20 jobs for us, but he can't do this one. Not from the grave. There's no one to finish this in time. Maybe the boy... - just maybe. - That's one hell of a maybe. - He's got talent. - Some, yes. Some? Some? When you've stopped smoking crack, call me from planet earth. Did you see what he did? He finished a half-Completed Charles Rollo Peters, Matched his work perfectly. So how'd you find me? Well, you know, it's a small town. - How are things? - Things are good. I made up with your brother. - He was just trying to protect me. - Yeah. He's cool. But I do think that after all my efforts, That I deserve a kiss. Whoa! Slow down! A kiss for the con man who punched my brother. - Yeah. - Hm... that sounds reasonable. It's an idea. - I have an idea. - What? How about you kiss my butt when I beat you down the beach. - What do I get if I win? - Nothing, and you'll like it! That's not fair! Whoa! - Amber! - I won! Whoa! I won, I won! Hey... you dropped this. I know. You did that on purpose. Moi? Never. You cheated. You cheated. That's ridiculous. I have played with cheaters before, But nothing like that. That's... big men can admit defeat. Well, yeah, but I didn't lose. But you didn't win. But I got these. - Give 'em! - Nope. Nope. - Give 'em, give 'em! - Nope. Give me the keys. Look at you. Cute doggy. Where's your owner? Huh? Let's see... oh. You're Anne-Marie's dog, Matilda. Come on. I'll take you home. Let's go. Let's go. Good girl. Come on. Let's go. Hey, I... found your friend, here, down at the beach today. - Thank you. - Yeah. Oh, you're a naughty girl. Nah, she's really sweet. Not when she's hungry. I just happen to have freshly-Made soup in the kitchen. Would you like to join me? Soup... soup does sound nice. Come on. - It was good. - Would you like some more? Seconds? Oh, no, Im fine, thanks. I have an idea. While Im cleaning up, Ive got a great collection of books over here And there might be something in there that might interest you. Oh, and by the way, I have a spare room out back. You're welcome to use it any time you want. Thanks. II was wearing cyanide... I...a way out for all those artists. IBut why? IAnd then, I found the why. I" Every scene is a long dream " I" Give me some colors " I" Every scene is a long dream " I" Give me some colors " I" Every scene is a long dream " I" Give me some colors " I" Every scene is a long dream. " The guy makes fakes. I" Give me some colors. " This place is nice. Nothing but the best for you. Thank you, Patrick. So, Everly... ...I found something pretty interesting down in your basement. Oh, what was that? I think you know what Im talking about. Well, let's just say I do. Now what? You pay me. Excuse me? Well, either you pay me or I tell everybody you're an art forgery dealer. I see. You're gonna pay my way out of this town Or else your little secret's out. And what am I supposed to pay you? - I was thinking about five. - Thousand? I meant 500, but... yeah, sure, five grand. What if I told you I knew how to make millions? That piece of work you saw in my house, Do you even know who the original artist was? No, I didn't think so. Charles Rollo peters. One of the most celebrated artists of his era. And you matched his exact style. Effortlessly. Joshua, you have... ...you have talent. Capturing what I see has just always come easy to me. I don't doubt it. So... you can really make that much money by selling fakes? If you follow my lead and don't question me. - That'll be hard. - This is real, Joshua. You've gotta use your talent for yourself. No one's gonna be looking out for you, not even me. Are you messing with me? I've got a job coming up right now. I could use your skills. If you pull it off, I'll split the money from the sale with you. Cash. - Seriously? - Trust me. Or I suppose I could just go fetch the 500 bucks you asked me for. Basically, with the losses at the Moli gallery, Added to the losses at the Laguna beach gallery, Added to the problems that we're having here, The overhead is $212,000 For this month alone. It's hard keeping three galleries open with so little coming in. What about the gallery here? We had a show last month. We moved two pieces. It's my birthday party coming up. You know what could happen? - I'm fully aware. - We gotta close this deal now. - And you think this boy is our best bet? - I don't know. All I know is we've gotta go to San Francisco And sell that Charles Rollo peters to the emir, Otherwise none of this matters anyway. The peters won't bring in much, but... ...if I can hook the emir, come my birthday, I'll have him eating out of my hand. Every detail matters. You have raw ability, but you're gonna have to be more strict with yourself Than you've ever been. The new work has to match the original perfectly. In every detail. Okay. So what are all these hammers for and stuff? Oh, that's for later, when we age the piece to perfection. - Age it? - Yeah. Yeah, you use the mallet to tap the painting To develop the Craquelure, the cracks, if you will. It makes the painting look older. Then you fill the cracks with dust, makes it look all the more real. But first, we have to find a canvas. Now this is an inexpensive canvas from the turn of the century, Painted by an amateur. Should match perfectly. What are you doing now? Stripping it. Okay, so you paint on a stripped canvas to help fool the experts. You take a painting by a particular artist, A lesser known work of little value... ...you strip it... ...and then paint a forgery of a more valuable work over it. Wow, I guess you have this thing down to a science. Many paintings hanging in great museums are forgeries. Really? Like, even famous ones? You'd better believe it. Well, I guess sometimes there's more than just meets the eye with a painting. Absolutely. In a lab, an oil painting can be analyzed quite thoroughly. So we have to make sure that no infrared Or chemical test will reveal us. Well, then I guess we gotta fool with some pretty serious experts. Yeah. One in particular. It is gorgeous. Pinkus, we all know you are the true expert. What do you say? I think I can vouch for its authenticity. You have done it again, Everly Campbell. My wife will love this. You know how she feels about peters. - The only other work she craves for is... - Winslow homer, yes. I saw your wife last month at Monte Carlo. I hope she did not get into one of her moods, Like that time in Kuala Lumpur. - That was bad, as you may recall. - I recall, but no. She was even more beautiful and more gracious than ever. Clearly a jewel in your crown. Ah. Flattery will only... make you rich. - Thank you, your highness. - You're welcome. There is a bank note in there for quarter of a million. - The tip is for good customer service. - You're too gracious. I know. I want to be sure we're still working towards - Getting a Winslow homer? - I think I may just have found the painting your wife craves. The rarest Winslow homer the world has yet to see. I have it at home in storage. I came across it under the most unusual circumstances. It's been hidden in Europe since the first world war. How much do you want? - An even ten million. - Ah... I assure you, this painting is going to stun the art world. - Pinkus? - Of course, such a painting Would require full infrared analysis And a letter of provenance. If you wish to speak for the painting, You're more than welcome to do a public analysis At my birthday party. Then you and the entire world will see the painting unveiled And publicly tested to prove its authenticity. Pinkus, we will go to Carmel. I don't know how you do it, Everly. We stick to the plan, the kid finishes the painting, We send him off to New York, get him out of Carmel. What about the police? We tell 'em he ran away. He's gonna bring problems. I can feel it coming. Bernie, I am tinkering with his life, but I wish somebody had done it for me. This kid is screwed up in the head. He's an emotional wreck. You know how hard a life in art is. Forgery isn't perfect, but he could make a living at it. I'm giving him a way so he never has to worry about money. Yeah, Im tinkering, but the little bastard - Doesn't even know how lucky he is. - Maybe. But if we commit to that date, then we only have a month. We are committed. If we don't sell that Winslow homer, I lose everything I have. Everything. Really high-End forgeries are the hardest to do. Some paintings are several centuries old, they have under-Paintings to them. What's an under-Painting? In truth, it's something you should not be concerned with yet. Homer's not known to have his works painted over. Are you using the blue I gave you? - Yeah. - Show it to me. See, this is the modern indigo blue. The pigment in modern oil paint is not the same as the ones Used in homer's day. They're completely different. Use the Prussian blue like I told you. Scrape it off, start over. You must be Sasha. Yeah, that's me. Thanks for coming down. How'd you get my probation officer to get me down here? They owed me a little favor. Look, um... ...I haven't seen Bryn in... it must be about three years now. Well, here's a police report. San Jose. Says you two were arrested. Together. October 17th. Right. There was that. - Slipped your mind? - Sure did, yep. I'm Joshuas case worker. - How is he? - Well, Sasha, he's not doing very well. I've got him placed in a home, temporarily, But he doesn't know where his mother is, he doesn't know why she left. I haven't been able to find any family, no friends. I mean, can you imagine what's going through his head? - He's gotta be very confused. - That's not good. No, it's not good. I want you to help me find Bryn. Look, I already told you... I don't know where she is. Well, you're lying to me. I don't have to take this. You're my only chance to find Bryn. I'm not the police. I'm not here to have her arrested. I just wanna help Joshua. He's a great little guy. Hm-Mm. He's a great guy. Well, that little guy is almost That her? Yeah, that's Bryn all right. Both had bullshit parents. I talked to a guy recently. He's a manager at a gentlemans club. He said that you two worked there together - And that you were waitresses... - Oh, come on, You can say it, Ms. Reese. It won't kill ya. ...as strippers. So, where is Bryn? She's probably at her loser boyfriend's house. Okay, do you have an address for me? Ah! Are you going to behave yourself? Yeah. All right. Come in. I Christmas lights around my neck  That's really good. Thanks. I had a great face to work with. Flattery is not gonna get you out of the doghouse. We're just friends. Friends hanging out, talking. - Right. - Is that cool? Yeah. Yeah, but... but what? The other day at the beach, I really... I really blew that. Yep. I missed out on a great opportunity and I just... the kiss was so... awful. Really awful. Worst ever. Worst? Ever. Yeah, sorry about that. Well, Im here now. I'm on my best behavior. I'm just standing here, me, with the door... ...me and the door. - Sit. - Really? Before I change my mind. When you kiss a girl... ...you have to be gentle. - Right. - Take my hand. Now kiss my hand, softly. No, no. On the top of my hand. Kiss the hand, then kiss the girl. I" The halo spins. " - Much better. - Good. If only you were a couple years older. Yeah, it's funny, I was just thinking... ...if only you were a couple years younger. What? - Oh, Ms. Reese. What a nice surprise. - Mr. Campbell. I was in the neighborhood, thought Id come by. You know, Im just heading out. I just wanted to talk for a very quick minute, - If that's okay? - Wonderful. You know, tomorrow night at six would be great. Oh, I meant right now, just very quickly. Bernie, is the car ready? - I was hoping to talk to josh. - What was that? - I wanted to talk to Joshua. - Bernie, Ill be outside, let's go! - Uh-Huh? - I'm fine to wait out here for him, it's not a problem. Would you excuse me just a moment? Hello? Yeah. Yeah, the papers are in the car. Yeah, Im on my way to the symposium now. Uh-Huh. Well, Ill... you're gonna have to work that out with the Japanese. - Nice to see you, call me later. What? - No, no... where is Joshua? He's not here, he took off this morning. Wait, we need to talk then. Yeah, listen, can I call you back? Mr. Campbell... if this is too much for you to take care of Joshua, I'm more than happy to find another home to place him in. No, no, no. I've got a handle on this. It doesn't appear that way to me. He's gone right now. He'll be back. You know very well you cannot let him go like that. You have to be supervising him or he has to be working for you at all times. - It's the mandate of the court. - Yeah, all right, Ill... this doesn't work for me. I'll find him immediately, all right? Yes, of course, Im sorry. You're right, Im sorry. Find him quickly, and you have to call me as soon as you find him Or I will get on the phone with the judge. - No, no, no, that won't be necessary. - Well, I will. - No, Ms. Reese... - I'll talk to you soon, then. So you live with Anne-Marie? No, I just hang out with her, she's cool. Old, but she's cool. Where's your mom and dad? Well, I, uh... I don't really have a dad. Well, I never really knew him. - Sorry, I didn't mean to... - Oh, no, it's cool. It's cool. It's a normal question. And my mom, she... she left me. Just kind of took off. That's... that's so scary. I'm sorry. I had no idea. At least you found Anne-Marie. I could see how you two would get along. Yeah, she's all right. Do you know who she is? Yeah, she's like, some famous artist. No, no, she's not just famous. Have you ever taken art history? Not really. All right, well, Ill tell you this... tons of artists would kill to have a conversation with her, Talk to her about her life, her art... yeah, she is a piece of work. Well, I think she sees something in you. She's got a good eye. Ah, that's adorable. I think Im gonna throw up. - What's up, man? - What's up, man? - How's it going? - Hey. Wanna go surf? No, dude, I can't even swim. - You can't swim? - What? Come on, come on. Oh, my god, who you hanging out with? You goony! We'll get him some floaties. - No, get him some swim lessons. - Yeah, some swim lessons. We'll throw you in, see if you can swim. - I can't, though. I know I can't. - I bet you can. Hey. The lady from child services came by. I had to make an excuse. - Listen, Everly... - Just shut up. We got work to do. Come on. Here. It looks good. Yeah, it's a passable job. As my dear mother used to say, "not bad, not bad, You can always do better. Never forget it. " My mom never noticed I was good at anything. Hm. Your mother. I wonder what she's doing right now. Probably taking drugs in an alleyway somewhere. Oh, geez, what, you're gonna cry now? - Great, that's all I need. - I wasn't... - forget about your mother. - I'm trying. - You gotta let go of all that. - How can I? I can't just stop thinking about it. Well, she stopped thinking about you. She doesn't care about you. You're gonna have to look after yourself. You're gonna be so rich. You can buy yourself a new mom. IEverything he said was right, and I hated him for it. IThere was only one way to hurt him back. So, I took the painting. It's a little overly-Sentimental, don't you think? No. - Really? - Yeah, I like it. - Is it yours? - Yes. Was she an old friend of yours? Well, she's about like you. Yeah, I like the colors. Her cheeks and her hair. Yeah, that's a technique. Now, as you are a student of the arts, You know that canvases come in different colors. So depending on the paints, what's underneath comes through. Hm. I never thought about it like that. Mm-Hm. You know, I was walking Matilda this morning And ran into some friends of yours. They're having a party. Maybe you should go. Yeah. Oh, that lovely girl might be there. I wasn't really invited to go. When it comes to girls, you make your own invitations. - Come on, go. You'll have a great time. - Okay. Yeah, go. Come inside. Ryan's playing pool. Come play pool. Josh, what's up? Hey. Hey! What are you doing, huh? - Stop! Stop! - Whoa, whoa! - What are you doing? - What are you doing? - Calm down. - I don't get you. - Stop it. - Chill out. Whoa! Guys, stop it! - Stop! - Stop! Stop! Calm down! Whoa, whoa. Stop! - It's our cousin. - What? Keen is our cousin. Unbelievable. Oh... what happened at that party? I got into a fight. But you were only gone for an hour. I didn't start it. The other guy did. He was all over amber. Oh. Oh, I see. So, this is the result of what you thought you saw. Yeah, I was really stupid. No, you're not stupid. Here, let me explain something to you. Take a look at that painting. Just take a good look at it. Look at it in this light. You're not quite sure what you're seeing, But it kind of looks like something. But... ...the minute I do this... ...it's completely different. So it has a completely different meaning. It's not what you expect at all. Something different. What are you really saying? What Im talking about is truth. Truth is about... ...what you do to get the proper perspective. Joshua, you know, I've been thinking for quite a while now, and... ...I was wondering... ...would you like to come and live with me here? - Is it my own choice? - Completely. - Do you really want me here? - Yes, I really, really do. - Maybe, I could. - Maybe, yes? Oh... ah! It's been such a long time since Ive had a child in my house. Hello? Hello? I'm looking for Joshua mason's mother, Bryn mason? Bryn? Is there a Bryn in the house? You get back here right now, Im gonna beat you! Whoa! Who the hell are you? - Are you Joshua mason's mother? - Yeah. So who are you? Well, what the hell's going on here? I... I just asked you... who are you? - No. Oh, no, you don't. - This is cps. - I'm talking to you, bitch! - I have an endangered child. I need a black and white. Everly? Everly? Oh... oh, no. Not again. I don't think we've been burgled. It's probably something worse. You are scum. I want you out of my house, now. I can't believe you're involving the boy. Oh, like he has so many options? Well, of course he has options. - But what you do will only hurt him. - By making him rich? By stunting his spirit... ...at a moment that he needs nurturing more than ever. The way I look at it, Im doing him a favor. As I see it, you're up to your old tricks. He's at your house, isn't he? Maybe. I don't make his schedule. Yeah, well, I want him back here. Today. We all want things. That doesn't mean we're going to get them. Bernie will be picking him up in 15 minutes. - He'd better have what belongs to me. - I'll get the car ready. Relax, Bernie. Joshua needs a little more time in bed. - He's injured and resting. - Injured? Don't worry, Everly, his hands are still intact. If you wanna get into this now, just like this, I'm gonna tell the whole world about you. It'll be great, huh? You without any dignity. You would take the only thing I have left. Now, be very careful with this one. - Still not here? - No. What do you think happened to him? The little bastard's upset and now he wants to see us sweat. Well, he's making a good job of it. Yeah, well, Ive still got one more move. Well, now would be the time to use it. Well... this is the call. - Hello? - Everly, how's everything going. Fine, fine, it's all going well. I believe the show is gonna go very, very well And we'll have everything settled by next week, dauphine. Everly, we are not a bank, so let me be completely clear. Next week, you pay the balance owed to my group, Or you turn over your entire holdings to us. Every house, every gallery, every car, everything. No more extensions. Bernie, I want you to get in your car and find that kid. - Well, I... - Just find him! That's a good girl. What's up? Hm? Look, I don't want any trouble, okay? I'm just messing with ya. Look, man, Im sorry, okay? I was really stupid. You should be. It was stupid. But look, you gotta make this right with my sister. Yeah. I messed that up. You did. But it's fixable. Let's go fix it. All right. Yoo-Hoo. You have a visitor. Hey, get over here. Ah... this is cute. - You two play nice. - You're a brat. Weirdo. Hey. Look, amber, I... ...I just wanted to apologize For how things went at the party. It was stupid. I was stupid. I just misread the whole situation and I acted like an ass. Yeah, you did. And you embarrassed yourself. I" All we are we are " Yeah. I" All we are we are " I" Every day is a start. " You know, you're lucky you're cute. I've heard that a few times. Cocky. So, uh... is that a second chance then? I believe you're on your third chance. Three strikes, you're out. - Got it? - Yeah. Mind a little company? Think it's gonna rain? - Hard to say. - True. I want that painting back. You've gotta give it back to me, Joshua. Well, you know, I haven't really made up my mind yet. You're playing with fire, kid. You know, Everly, I like watching you squirm. You know, all Ive done is offer you a chance. I'm giving you a golden pass to a life where you can look after yourself. Oh, really, like you? You're mad at me because you think I used you. Well, it's true, I did. So what? That's life. Nothing comes free. Although, Anne-Marie wouldn't want you to think that. Whatever, you're nothing like her. - Really? - Yeah, really. She has integrity. That woman's got you twisted up in the head. She has no integrity. You wanna know about Anne-Marie? I'll tell you. Check out her studio. Dig around. Dig deep. You might find something familiar. See you around, kid. Oh, good afternoon. Is it? What would you think of calling Vanessa Reese today, And just having a little chat with her, you know, talk things over? You know what I think? This is what I think. Joshua... you're a liar. I am not. Why don't you listen to me? Why don't you listen to what I have to say? No. You're just like the rest of them. Oh... I did the research you wanted on that woman, Anne-Marie Cole. - Oh, good, what'd you find? - You wouldn't believe it. Apparently, Anne-Marie was investigated by the police. Investigated, huh? Detectives questioned her three different times About her involvement in an art forgery scandal. You're kidding. Was she arrested? No, but there were rumors That she painted the forgeries, Because right after the investigation was closed, She came up with a huge chunk of money. Apparently, the money was used to cover a surgery cost for her kid. - When did this happen? - It was about 40 years ago. Her husband and kids burned in an accidental house fire. Only one survived. She did what she had to do, but even with the surgeries, Her daughter passed away a few weeks later. Let's see... Wow. Hm... Joshua, hi! Hi, thanks for meeting. It's gorgeous here, huh? How you doing? Everything okay at Everly's? It's fine. You know, I know you and Anne-Marie have become friends and I know she's a little eccentric, but I brought something That might help you understand why she is the way she is. I don't care. She's nuts. Really. Just read this, it'll only take a sec. Look, I know why you're really here. So... ...did you ever find my mom? You know, sometimes it takes a while to put pieces together and... I asked you a question. Did you find my mom? No, I didn't find your mom. The presentation is starting. If that painting doesn't arrive in three minutes, Im finished. I looked for Joshua. I drove all over town all day looking for him. - He's disa... - Oh... I thought you might like this. Yeah, it's good, it's good. Get it out there, quick. Where the hell were you hiding it? It's been safe the whole time. Joshua, I could... You did good. Here. In the morning, we're flying private to new York. I got another piece I want you to start working on, A $20 million Gustav Klimt. Finally, Ill get you out of Carmel. - Gonna make you rich. - Ladies and gentlemen, Please join the sunset center in welcoming Mr. Everly Campbell. Thank you. Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for joining me on this very special occasion of my 60th birthday. I want to open by saying that you all know me as a businessman, But Ive always thought of myself, first and foremost, as an artist. And as any artist who wants to be the best they can be, It's always been important to me to honor and acknowledge Those who came before. And it's in this spirit that I have scoured the earth To find a painting by one of the greatest of all American artists, Winslow homer. And tonight, we can unveil the rarest Winslow homer The world has yet to see. This is a work I acquired recently, A painting that was thought to have been lost or destroyed during world war I. But it was found, perfectly intact, and with a verifiable provenance. But, in order to prove its authenticity beyond a doubt, Mr. Jeffrey Pinkus, one of the world's foremost scientific art analysts, Will begin to verify the painting tonight, Using an infrared analysis. Mr. Pinkus? Bernie. The camera is now scanning the painting And will construct an image of what lies beneath the surface, Thereby revealing any irregularities or underlying images. It's an almost instantaneous process And will reveal the true nature of the artwork. Wait, stop! You can't do this! It's a masterpiece! Security! - You know it's all over. - What are you doing? Getting into it with you. I swear, Everly Campbell, You shut up and let me speak. Ladies and gentlemen, all of you deserve an explanation of what you've just seen. It's about this painting... ...and this man... ...and demonstrates what can happen and often does in the art world. Ladies and gentlemen... ...this painting is a forgery. She's a liar! - What is going on here? - That's a lie! A long time ago, I created one of Everlys masterpieces, And it's haunted me ever since. No, this is all incredibly stupid... wait a minute! There's something wrong. There's an image that shouldn't be here. - What do you mean? - There's an under-Painting. There shouldn't be any under-Painting on a Winslow homer. This is evidently a forgery. Well! What are you doing here? I thought you were mad at me. I, uh... I decided that... ...Id like to stay with you. You've come to the right place. Come right in. II should've known what I was looking for that night. II crawled in Anne-Marie's window. II was looking for a place to belong. IShe knew that the moment she met me. It just took me a while to believe it. IYou could say I grew up in Carmel, even though I didn't. INot the way a normal kid does. IBut it's where I got my education, that's for sure. II learned to use my talent... the right way. II learned how to say "Im sorry" and "thank you" IAnd how to keep my fists to myself. I- But the best lesson I learned... - Help me up. IFirst you kiss the hand... I...and then you kiss the girl. I" We were sleeping in for years " I" Letting go of our friends " I" Scaring our friends " I" We were seeing clearer closing our eyes " I" And our lashes intertwined " I" The things you find " I" In the backseat of your mind " I" What you find " I" And we filled each other's footprints in the snow " I" Full of warm red alcohol " I" We were learning to make the world stand still " I" And it will, but until " I" Do I lie in the backseat " I" Of your mind? " I" Do I lie? " I" Just a second and we're gone " I" Just an imprint when we're done " I" Just a second and we're gone " I" Just an imprint when we're done " I" It should be forever " I" God told me " I" We're born into the wrong time " I" It should be forever " I" God told me " I" We're born into the wrong time " I" It should be forever " I" God told me " I" We're born into the wrong time " I" It should be forever " I" God told me " I" We're born into the wrong time " I" It should be forever " I" God told me " I" We're born into the wrong time " I" It should be forever " I" God told me " I" We're born into the wrong time " I" It should be forever " I" God told me " I" We're born into the wrong time "
