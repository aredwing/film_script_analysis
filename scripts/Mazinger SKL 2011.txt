Don't be scared. We know we can since the Death Caprice squad went in a week ago. You mean Kaidou and Magami's squad? You know about those two, don't you? Something's not right with them. "Grim Reaper." "Jinx." "Battlefield Skull Collector." "Hell's Pilot." Those are the nicknames they got in their mercenary days. Seems it doesn't just apply to foes. They fulfill their missions... ...but only they return alive. The rest of their team's sure to get wiped out. Maybe we're the red shirts this time. What's wrong, smeg heads? You all look like you'd rather run home to mama! Well, suck it up and listen. We're nearly above the mission zone on Kikaijima Island. Comms are cut due to the gravity curtain's effects... ...so we still don't know the Death Caprice squad's status. Maybe shutting down the gravity engine is taking longer or some problem sprung up. If this mission fails, you can say goodbye to our planet! Our Glen Falcon squad's going in the gravity curtain to shut down the gravity engine! Show 'em what marines are made of! I couldn't hear you! That's right! Get your shit together, smeg heads! Lieutenant Yuuki. Combat's not your job this time. Just focus on stopping the engine. You'll be fine with us supporting you. Yes, ma'am. Visual on gravity curtain. Computing entry route. Transfer to cargo chief. Computing entry route. Transfer to cargo chief. Roger. Prepare to detach. Mission and current data sent to all terminals. Confirmed. Instrumental navigation useless due to anomaly. Going in visually. Roger! Prepare for entry! We've got 66 hours till our time limit. Glen Falcon squad is now entering the gravity curtain. Deploy gravity plasma emission system! Entry path confirmed. Begin penetrating the gravity curtain now. Roger. Starting cargo separation system. Good luck, Captain Scarlet! Good luck, Captain Scarlet! Roger that. Start the engines! Roger that. Start the engines! Charge graviton coils! Fire! Captain Scarlet! Wind shear. Pull up. Wind shear. Wind shear. Pull up. Bow down to Lord Garan, you Kiba brats! Shut up! Die, you old Garan farts! W-What the... Kaiser... Its pilots... ...are Special Forces Lieutenants Kaidou and Magami. Uh-oh, Magami. Looks like Yuuki's passed out. Great, a survivor we have to look after. Kaidou! It's show time! Here we go! Stay alive the deadly game you play. Burn the torch now to light the way. Stay alive to break down the wall. The time has come to make the final call. Are we standing on the edge of hope? The human race is on its way to destruction. Fire back to bring us back to life. We are the soldiers at the edge of time. Mazinkaiser! We are the soldiers of eternity. Yeah! Mazinkaiser! Immortal god machine sets the world free. Mazinkaiser! We're gonna fly to the end of the sky. Mazinkaiser SKL Mazinkaiser! Come on! Mazinkaiser! After the great war, a gravity curtain formed around Kikaijima Island. Therefore, no aircraft or ship can get very close to it. Perhaps it was some automated defense system, but we aren't even sure. However, our surveillance systems recently detected... ...the gravity engine's final alarm emanating from the island. If we ignore it and the engine collapses... ...it will probably inflict catastrophic damage on the world. The Skull Force will now launch its Kikaijima Gravity Engine Shutdown mission. Focus the shield on the front of the castle. Protect Lady Aira! Where's that skull bastard? There you are. Just you wait! Kiba's going to finish you off personally! Get the hell outta my way! Goddamned peons. Kaidou! Switch with me! It's all yours. This devil... It will be the god who brings us salvation... This Kiba dude never learns. Switch out, Magami! Switch out, Magami! Sure. Friggin' muscle head. Yahoo! Don't let it go to your head! We're not through! C'mon! C'mon! That's fine with me! That's fine with me! Boss! The main Garan force is on the move. Say what? Is Garan himself with them? I see his mech on the scanners. Looks like he's there. If he just sat back and watched as usual... ...we were going to go on and storm Hachiryoukaku. You guys just narrowly escaped death! You can bet we'll finish this next time we meet! Don't forget that! Sure, he talks big. He's so stupid I can't believe it. Who are you to talk? Kiba forces or Garan forces... There's still a risk when you leave your fortress. Guess that's how it is. Hey, did you say something weird in the confusion back there? Don't be so jumpy. We don't exactly plan to eat you or anything. This is Hachiryoukaku. This is Hachiryoukaku. Hachiryoukaku? I'm Hurricane. This is Flash. Who are you? Glen Falcon squad first lieutenant Tsubasa Yuuki. You came in from the outside, didn't you? We won't have much of a conversation if you're that wound up. It's okay. Let's take her to meet Aira. It's okay. Let's take her to meet Aira. I guess that's the quickest way. I guess that's the quickest way. Boss! We're ready to attack Hachiryoukaku. Yeah, we'll settle things tonight as planned. Then we'll have all the women waiting on us we could want! Neither Garan nor the Hachiryoukaku women would ever expect two raids in one day. That takes guts. That's right, boss! Well said! Come on, men! Let's go kick some ass! Lord Garan. Himiko? Yes, sir. How shall we arrange our forces? Standing by on this side of the ridge. Kiba's after Hachiryoukaku. And there's the skull mech. We'll watch the battle for an opportunity. As you wish. He who loses his patience loses the battle, Kiba. I am Aira, leader of Hachiryoukaku. That's strange... I sense warmth from her. Our parents were imprisoned on this island when the great war ended. Conflicts have been going on here ever since. It's simply because this environment... ...lets us endlessly produce the tools of our warfare, robots. They're on the move. We'll go once we eat. These are this island's three fortresses. This is Hachiryoukaku, Kiba's coastal fortress, and Castle Garan in the mountains. Each is equipped with a robot-manufacturing plant. Are you aware this island's gravity engine is nearing its limit? Yes. We came here to keep the gravity engine from exploding. At this rate, the giant explosion will collapse Earth's magnetic field... ...probably wiping out all life. I didn't know it progressed that far... And the engine controls? It can only be controlled from each of the three plants. This current situation is likely caused by Kiba's or Garan's fortress... ...extracting more than the maximum allowed energy. If we explain it to them... The fighting's been going on so long that it's everything to them. No! But they'll both be destroyed too. The pleasure they derive from fighting means even more than death. We brought a combat robot with us. Perhaps Kaiser can... Kaiser? So you people call that devil Kaiser... That skull mech? It's definitely powerful. But it's just one mech. A large group of Kiba robots is headed this way! There are so many! But nearly all our robots are docked after the fighting earlier today! Lord Garan. The Kiba forces have mobilized. Now to see what the outsiders do. Keep a close eye on them. Certainly, sir. Aira! Today's the day you, Hachiryoukaku, and the other women become mine! I don't mind some damage, boys! Show 'em real good now who the boss of this world is! We recovered your mech. The pilder... If I can contact Kaiser... Hurry! Hurry! The safe-shutdown deadline is in about fifty hours. Hey! You're not fighting in that, are you? I'll try calling Kaiser. I'll try calling Kaiser. Even if you do, what good's one more ally? Even if you do, what good's one more ally? Let's go! Quickly! I'm gonna make you my woman and have my way with ya. Yuuki of Glen Falcon calling Death Caprice. Amon Six, Lucifer Four, please respond. Lieutenant Kaidou! Kaiser! Looks like she survived. Lieutenant Kaidou, respond. She's calling you. Say something. I can't stand dealing with her. The kid's too serious and stiff. I agree. Lieutenant Magami, please respond. Hey, how come she said please to you and not to me? This is Lucifer Four. This is Lucifer Four. Please respond ASAP. Requesting backup for Hachiryoukaku. Say what? Technical Officer Yuuki, I don't think you have the authority to give us orders. Everybody else in Glen Falcon was wiped out. Including Captain Scarlet? Including Captain Scarlet? Yes. So as a regular first lieutenant, I am now in command. So Special Forces is a demotion? So Special Forces is a demotion? Please tell me your current position. There's no need. Damn it! I wish they'd hold still! W-What the? W-What? Is that Kaiser? Here we go! It's the skull mech! Him, huh? Take this! Bastard! They're powerful enough, but it takes forever for them to come back. Yuuki, have Hachiryoukaku's robots fall back. They're in the way of combat. They're in the way of combat. Roger. Hachiryoukaku, please respond. This is Yuuki. Hachiryoukaku here. Please leave this battle to Kaiser, fall back, and focus on defending your fortress. But... The men piloting it are dangerous. You'll get hit too if you're too close. All right, I'll notify them right away. I won't go down easy! Fall back to the fortress wall! How can we trust that robot we know nothing about? We'll defend our territory ourselves! Hurricane! I see you! Well, aren't you a beaut? No! Damn it! That's why we said to fall back! It's about time we switched. Yeah. Sucks for you that we're here. Now, where would you like to be shot? Answer within five seconds and I'll honor your request. Who do you think you are? Time's up. I'm not through! Impossible... How could my entire army get wiped out? Just one mech... They've cornered Kiba. They've cornered Kiba. What is that thing? A monster? But of course. This is the kind of fight I've been waiting for! Hey, skull bastard! Can you keep up with me? Look out. Kiba just drew his sword. I'll leave the swordplay to you. Neither of you really feel alive unless you're fighting! It's funny how you can get along while killing each other! Less talking, more fighting! I'm happy you showed up to challenge me. But I can't stand you either. You think you can show up here and do as you please? That's cool if you resent me! Bring it on! You'll pay for that! H-How dare you head-butt me, asshole? Hey, hey. Go easy on the cockpit. A spoiled kid who can't even assess a battle shouldn't be runnin' an army! Shit... That's what you get! Want to switch, Kaidou? Want to switch, Kaidou? Shut up! I've got this one! Shut up! I've got this one! What? When we meet a god, we cut him down. When we meet a demon, we shoot him down. We fight 'cause we want to! We smash because we want to! We smash because we want to! We don't have any just cause! We don't have any just cause! Gotcha! I'll be waiting for you in hell! There's no point in doing that. We are hell. They took down Kiba... Is this really the god that will bring us salvation? The fangs that stroke the darkness cry. The fallen sky wails. Listen to the melody of survival and death. If you're confused, open your eyes and try to pierce the beating in your chest. A state of desolation, a state of pleasure. See if you can predict the ending. The destruction is right before your eyes. Voices quarrel with each other fearlessly. On a night when a fake can go mad... ...that's the time to get lost in fantasy. Dark dreams wash away reason... ...and burn away the passing time. The fangs that stroke the darkness cry. The fallen sky wails. Listen to the melody of survival and death. The black world that calls out for bloodshed. The fallen red tears. Look at the haunting memories of demise. That ominous mechanical silhouette... Stay alive the deadly game you play. Burn the torch now to light the way. Stay alive to break down the wall. The time has come to make the final call. Are we standing on the edge of hope? The human race is on its way to destruction. Fire back to bring us back to life. We are the soldiers at the edge of time. Mazinkaiser! We are the soldiers of eternity. Yeah! Mazinkaiser! Immortal god machine sets the world free. Mazinkaiser! We're gonna fly to the end of the sky. Mazinkaiser SKL Mazinkaiser! Come on! Mazinkaiser! What has Death Caprice been doing up to this point? What, isn't it obvious? We were dragged into the conflict, and everyone but us was wiped out. Didn't your team get wiped out too? I just wish Captain Scarlet were still around... She's dead, huh? I can't say I didn't like her. Himiko. What do you think exists in the outside world? A new land, where we could live in peace? Or do you wish for even more war? My opinion is the same as yours, Lord Garan. My dream is a warrior's dream. So long as somebody cares for this martial hell... ...someday we may yet see a world of blessedness. Aira Mu Gebet. Why have you appeared in this form, devil? The place is empty, huh? Did all of them really go out into battle? That's impossible. Even if this were all-out war... ...you never empty out your headquarters completely. Ask and ye shall receive. Seems they won't listen to reason. You're going to kill them? You're going to kill them? You gonna get killed? Incoming. Let's have some fun! Seems you at least paid attention when they trained you to take down enemies. You'd best get a better grasp on the situation... ...or you're not going to survive it. Now, it's your turn. How's the radiation level? Low enough to be fine for protective gear. Watch out for rips. Relax. We'll recover your body. If there's anything left! Give it a rest. I know. If she screws up, we're as good as dead too. I was lightening the mood. Well? Think you can stop it? It's all right. I'm not disarming a time bomb. It's antiquated, but I'll grasp it all if it's a standard system. Sounds promising. What? What? A trap was set. Say what? But it wasn't a professional job. They applied a basic firewall. It'll reject stop commands and contaminate this area. Really? Can't you cancel it? It's just an amateur trick. No way I'd fall for it. Proceed with care. It may be misdirection. Naturally. I checked. Wanna know the trick? It's the red wire... Wanna know the trick? It's the red wire... Keep quiet. That's one down. Lieutenant Yuuki, didn't that priestess Aira promise to help with Hachiryoukaku's plant? Yes. Let's hurry and stop that one too. Garan's plant is the problematic one. I'll use Himiko's mind as a mirror to show me Garan's true intent. Aira Mu Gebet. Aira Mu Gebet. Himiko, show me the truth. What's wrong? Nothing. You know all there is to know. About the gravity engine and the people who came from the outside. Now that Kiba's gone, there's no reason for us to fight on this tiny island. You are the one who should lead the island. Himiko, what are you hiding? Garan? This is Garan's true goal. If you assist us... ...we will accept Hachiryoukaku as our Kikaijima brethren. But if you won't follow us... I cannot. Then you leave us no choice. Sometimes I feel jealous of your powers. Surely you jest. We'll win control of Hachiryoukaku! We'll win control of Hachiryoukaku! Yes, my lord. We have our orders! We're going to attack Hachiryoukaku! Begin the advance! Begin the advance! Yes, sir! What will you do next, Lieutenant Yuuki? I'll return to Hachiryoukaku and stop the second remote control device. They promised to cooperate, so I don't suppose they'll just sit and watch. We'll go ahead to Garan's fortress and make your job easier by cleaning it out. Is that necessary? Is that necessary? Don't be naive. Garan will fight, no matter what happens. There's no time, so I'll permit it. Now get going! Jeez... The nuisance is finally gone. Garan's forces have declared war on us. Psycho gear interceptors, to the defense line. Those with psycho barrier abilities, please stand by at your assigned positions. Garan is attacking... It's like things are getting hectic since that devil showed. This was bound to happen. It's not that devil's fault at least. Of course, it's probably still a jinx. Garan's forces? Hachiryoukaku is now deploying its shield. I'm on my way. It'll be a battlefield. It's not safe, so stay back. But... But... Yuuki, how did it go at Kiba's plant? Yuuki, how did it go at Kiba's plant? We shut it down. We shut it down. All right. Now stay back. We'll contact you again. Wait! The gravity engine's safe-shutdown deadline is in 44 hours... We can't hope for Kaiser's help in the Hachiryoukaku battle... Look. It's a castle. That's a bit much, as anachronisms go. What? Enemy attack! Return fire! They're attacking my headquarters to protect Hachiryoukaku... What fools. Our front-line units are in position. Order them to begin. Don't let them get any closer! Let's get them! Let's get them! Roger! Stand your ground. We need to stop them here! Stupid bitches! You don't stand a chance! Bow down to Lord Garan! Then we'll at least spare your lives! Shut the hell up! Never underestimate a woman! Shit, can't get closer. So now what? I'll just do this from the inside! That must be Garan. You're an amusing fellow. Even with my abilities, I fail to comprehend your actions. Why barge in here? We don't have any just cause. We fight 'cause we want to. We smash 'cause we want to. That's all. You must be joking. Interesting. Come now and see if you can finish me! You'll regret that! Let's do this! You're good at charging in close. But all you're doing is getting closer to hell! That's just the way I like it! I can only assume that was meant as an insult. It just means I'm gettin' a little serious. You're determined too. So you're one of that skull devil's pilots. I want to fight the skull devil. Are you sayin' a flesh-and-blood one-on-one fight isn't good enough? If you die, I'll no longer get to have a bout against your robot. That might end up being a terrible thing. Now, face me with it. I'm going to make use of a robot too. Pilot it or be crushed where you stand! Say what? Hey! Don't you turn your back on me! Okay, have it your way! Shit, that dude's crazy! I don't think you can talk. If he wants to see it that bad, let's show him good! Pilder on! Pilder on! Yeah! Here we go! Guess what... This place just became a little piece of hell! These guys are a pain in the ass. I can deal better with projectiles. I can deal better with projectiles. You got me there. Gotcha! If this battle lasts too long, the invokers will run out of spiritual energy. We have to finish this fast. You hit me! There he is. Isn't he a little old for the "long jacket" look? How did your mech end up looking so ghastly? It's kind of a long story. Nobody but us can handle piloting it. You two can't defeat me. That's going to end up being your destiny. Destiny, huh? That man... Switch out, Magami! Let me take him! No, let me stay in control. What for? I don't mind his philosophical ego or condescending arrogance... ...but I can't stand people who use the word "destiny"! If it means that much to you, Kaiser's yours. But if you think you're in trouble... But if you think you're in trouble... Yeah, I know. I'll take you on. Why don't you come kill a little time with us? That sounds good to me. I have the edge in power, speed, and armor! And I'm the better pilot! You don't like the word "destiny"? Shut up! You're the kind of man unavoidable destiny loves to trifle with. You can't escape your destiny. It's why you were born. So... he's one too... What's wrong? I can tell you're unsettled. Lord Garan. Himiko? About the man currently piloting it... So... that means you're an erbsnde just like us! Shut up! Hey, Magami, what's wrong? Bten Gefhl al Kvar... Uh-oh... Uh-oh... The psycho barrier is weakening. The psycho barrier is weakening. Hold on, everyone... What are you doing, Magami? All too easy... Screw you! I'm my own man! I'll live the way I want and die the way I want! My life belongs to me and nobody else! I happen to feel the same way about mine. Magami, switch with me! Gefhl al Kvar... Switch out, Magami! No, I'm the only one! It's nap time, asshole! What's going on? That was a bit of a letdown, but it was fun all the same. The rocks are in the way, so the payload won't open. Don't think you've won just yet... How could this happen? This is boring. Die! You son of a bitch... You lost your cool... ...and now we're in hell. The fangs that stroke the darkness cry. The fallen sky wails. Listen to the melody of survival and death. If you're confused, open your eyes and try to pierce the beating in your chest. A state of desolation, a state of pleasure. See if you can predict the ending. The destruction is right before your eyes. Voices quarrel with each other fearlessly. On a night when a fake can go mad... ...that's the time to get lost in fantasy. Dark dreams wash away reason... ...and burn away the passing time. The fangs that stroke the darkness cry. The fallen sky wails. Listen to the melody of survival and death. The black world that calls out for bloodshed. The fallen red tears. Look at the haunting memories of demise. That ominous mechanical silhouette... Time for an all-out assault! We've finished off that skull devil, so why do I still feel uneasy? Aira. Sister. The skull devil, your great hope, is no more. Captain, a gravity-curtain disturbance... Gather data and relay it to HQ! Yes, sir. Damn, there's no end. There's too many of them. There's too many of them. We can't afford to lose! Is that on our side? I'll fight too. Yuuki? I don't know how long I'll last... ...but I'll try. ...but I'll try. Yuuki... Stand firm. Yeah! Yeah! Let's go. Wow, Captain Scarlet would be proud. Not bad, Yuuki. What? W-What's that? W-What's that? Not good! Fall back inside the barrier! Not good! Fall back inside the barrier! Hurry! W-What the? Stay alive the deadly game you play. Burn the torch now to light the way. Stay alive to break down the wall. The time has come to make the final call. Are we standing on the edge of hope? The human race is on its way to destruction. Fire back to bring us back to life. We are the soldiers at the edge of time. Mazinkaiser! We are the soldiers of eternity. Yeah! Mazinkaiser! Immortal god machine sets the world free. Mazinkaiser! We're gonna fly to the end of the sky. Mazinkaiser SKL Mazinkaiser! Come on! Mazinkaiser! What's going on? What was that just now? W-What's happening? What the hell is happening? It's the gravity engine... So it's finally begun. Lord Garan. Gravity swells from the out-of-control gravity engine generated a shock wave... ...which has apparently destroyed our army. Become the cornerstone of my ambition... ...and wait together for me in hell. Make sure. You have to make sure. Stay alive. Keep on surviving and make sure. As long as you're alive... ...you're getting closer to the answer. Hey, how long are you gonna sleep? Wake the hell up! We're in deep shit thanks to you. You're still alive? You bet! It'd make the devil himself cry if that's all it takes to kill us! Looks like you're back. Yeah, and I remembered something important. I have to make sure what my reason for living is. Did I hit you too hard? Ow, damn! I'm bleedin' again. The gravity engine... It's meteorologically unheard of. The randomly expanding weather disturbance... ...has already caused damage to all Pacific coastal areas. If this keeps up... The gates of hell will open. Well, well... Our fight's not over yet. It's time for round two. I praise your tenacity at the very least. But if it's like our last fight... ...you don't stand a chance in hell. Let's find out! Very well! Lord Garan... What good is a just cause? It's just an idea you use to fool people, including yourself! No matter how an ambitionless man speaks, it is nothing but a stray dog's howl! You seem totally different than before. This should be fun. Take your time and savor it. I'm taking the you-know-what. You mustn't use it... You're so high and mighty... Power only exists to be used! Himiko! Now, Magami! To think I'd weigh my ambition against my feelings for just one woman... He doesn't know when to quit. You two speak of hell! Well, come join me, because I'm on my way there! Sister... We were born with the same power. We had the same feelings for our people... ...but we followed different paths. But originally, we were guided by the same power. Guided by the same power... It's the same with that devil. The power... If it's returned to its source... ...our divided wills will return to the pure power they were before their division. But it will mean the loss of one of them... Himiko... You should've just told me... I already know this is where it is. Why the hell did Garan leave himself open like that? What? Hey, that can't be good... Lieutenant Yuuki, respond. This is Lucifer Four. Lieutenant Yuuki, respond! Lieutenant Magami. Lieutenant Magami. Sitrep? The island's center gravity engine went wild, causing a gravity swell... ...and generating a shock wave that wiped out the Garan forces. Are you guys okay? We're protected by Hachiryoukaku's barrier. How do we stop the engine? At this point, none of the methods we planned will work... You're giving up? Finding a way to stop it is your job. Find one already. Shut up! I had enough trouble trying to launch the Wingle! You did? Awesome. Good for you. Keep quiet! What is that? It looks like an energy cable. There's an enormous amount of energy being transmitted... That mech... Iron Kaiser? Kaiser? Are they related? What's that doing here? I know who's in it... Time to settle the score, Skully! Kiba! There must still be some way. Yuuki. Himiko told me this the moment she died. We're holding all the cards. You're goin' down, pal! I'll make you grovel, you skull bastard! Go on and try it! Guided by the same power? Yes. She said those two devils are the same. The devil sleeping in this land was using that vast power... ...to suppress, control, and seal up the gravity engine. That's true, when you think of it in terms of energy... I'll find out. Thank you, Aira. God damn it... Where's that Wingle? Comm from Lt. Yuuki. This is Lieutenant Yuuki of Glen Falcon. HQ, please respond. Lieutenant Yuuki? What's the situation? There isn't time. I'll report that to you later. I need detailed data on Iron Kaiser and the graviton reactor. Iron Kaiser? Please transmit the data to the Wingle ASAP. But that's level-6 classified info. Tell us what's happening. I don't know if we can stay in contact. Hurry! Just explain yourself. I'm telling you there's no time for that! What? Quit wasting time! It'll be your fault if Earth blows up! Make it snappy! She's got balls. H-How dare you! I'll permit it. Lieutenant Yuuki, I'll make him transmit the data. B-But... Just send it! We're counting on you, Lieutenant Yuuki. Yes, sir. I knew it. Iron Kaiser's energy source is like the gravity engine's... ...a graviton reactor. The gravity engine's out of control! Everyone, get inside the fortress! This energy is so wicked... What was that? A graviton reactor. A graviton reactor. What? Iron Kaiser has the same energy source as the gravity engine. What's the matter? Done already? We're getting our asses handed to us! Lieutenant Yuuki, time to use it! Can you do it? Yes! I'll try dropping it from high altitude to avoid the gravity disturbance. Tiara Aile and Ange Guard, detach! The Wing Cross! The Wing Cross! Yeah! Good. It's accepting our commands now. You weren't the only one holdin' on to a trump card! Iron Tornado! Rust Stream! The gravity engine went into meltdown... Pulse beam mode, fully charged. Now, where would you like to be shot? Screw you! You're better than I expected, Kiba! Yuuki here. The gravity engine's melted down. What? What? If it reaches the core, Earth's doomed! If it reaches the core, Earth's doomed! Who cares? Smasher Punch! Quit copyin' us! Tornado Crusher! Here I come! Dumb-ass! There was no need to launch our pilder! Sorry, got carried away. Now you get to see how good I am in a dogfight! I found a way. Like what? Not that I have time to deal with you right now. Lieutenant Yuuki, I'll listen. Come on, hurry and say it! It involves... Yeah? ...colliding particles with antiparticles, which will cause energy decomposition. Got it. You're talking annihilation. But I'm asking you to kill yourselves! If you're positive there's no other way, then that's fine by us. We just have to blow Iron Kaiser up with the gravity engine, right? We have a lot more fun blowing the shit out of something... ...than just switching it off anyway! Go ahead... Shoulder Blaster! That thing really hurts. That's the last time you get to show off, punk ass! What? Thor Hammer Breaker! That didn't do a damn thing! Let go of me! Calm down and quit struggling. The fun's only just beginning! A-Are you trying to die? Shut up. You're supposed to be dead anyway. It should be fun to gamble on who dies first, you or us. So let's treat ourselves to a boiling pot of hell. You want to settle the score in the afterlife? Life, afterlife, whatever. You're already in hell. You guys really are idiots! Inferno Blaster! We came to Kikaijima Island after detecting an irregularity with the gravity engine. The place was practically a miniature garden ruled by antique science. Thanks to the gravity curtain, their giant combat robots... ...their plants, and their manufacturing facilities... ...it was a microcosm of never-ending warfare. It was Kaiser the devil that put an end to the fighting. And Iron Kaiser, which was once researched using the same data... ...slumbered here. That was probably no coincidence. Aira! The devil still has a job to do. The fangs that stroke the darkness cry. The fallen sky wails. Listen to the melody of survival and death. If you're confused, open your eyes and try to pierce the beating in your chest. A state of desolation, a state of pleasure. See if you can predict the ending. The destruction is right before your eyes. Voices quarrel with each other fearlessly. On a night when a fake can go mad... ...that's the time to get lost in fantasy. Dark dreams wash away reason... ...and burn away the passing time. The fangs that stroke the darkness cry. The fallen sky wails. Listen to the melody of survival and death. The black world that calls out for bloodshed. The fallen red tears. Look at the haunting memories of demise. That ominous mechanical silhouette... Captain Yuuki, we're nearing the mission zone. All right, open cargo bay doors. Begin drop! Good luck, emissaries from hell. We're no emissaries! The two of us... ...are hell itself!
