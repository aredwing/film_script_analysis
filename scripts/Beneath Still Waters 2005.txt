Just do it. Come on. Let's go! Wow! Look at that! Come on. Look at this! - Hey, what are you doing? - Who cares? This whole town will be under water in a week. Look at that! Come on. Listen. There are people in there. No way. There can't be. Well, there fucking are. You hear that? Let's go. No. Someone might be trapped. Come on. Come on! Teo, wait! Teo! Teo? Teo! Luis! They're down here! Teo! Teo, what's going on? They're going to drown. We've got to help them. Over here. Don't bother with them. Untie my hands. Teo, no! Come back! Teo! Come back! Help! Help! Help me! Help! Help! Help me! Help, someone! Clara. Clara. Clara. Granddad? Clara. He's coming. Clara, are you okay? Yes. It's nothing. It's just... It's just that I fell asleep. Another bad dream? Is this some kind of ghost book? Honey, let it out. Or, hell, you'II end up as crazy as... As what? My grandfather? Susana, what do you think happens when we die? Don't be so morbid. Sometimes I just... I lie in bed in the dark, and I think that... before I was born, I didn't exist. After I die, I won't exist. And it makes me feel terrible. Don't you think we have a soul? Do you think this is all there is? Maybe the soul is like a drop of water... and when we die, we join all of our loved ones. I just feel like something really bad is going to happen. Oh, come on. What you need is to have a little fun. Let's get wet. It's cold. Come on, Clara. No, no, no. Oh, yeah, let's go. Come on. Oh, it's cold. It's so cold. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. - Did you feel that? - What? Something down there. Speaking of fun. Want a beer? Here! Let's go for a ride on my jet ski. Sure. - L'm freezing. - Come on, girl. Have a little fun. Clara. Go for it. Antonio? Antonio. Where are you? Come out, come out, wherever you are! Antonio! Stop! Antonio, don't you dare. My God! My God! Antonio! Susana! Wait! Susana! What's wrong? What's that? Oh, my God! I don't know, like somebody was grabbing me. It's okay. It's okay. Guess I just got stuck. Huh? Huh? Oh, fuck. Oh, help! Help! Antonio? Getting in my pants! Woof! Woof woof! - Stop it! - Dick. Stop that, you naughty thing! Stupid... What the... What the fuck? Clara! Oh, God! Oh, God. Oh, no. L'd just like a little advance, yeah? Yeah, yeah. Will I get some pictures? Marcia, come on. Of course you'II get pictures. You'II get great stuff. These towns are built on dirty politics. Listen, I want some really good stuff this time, okay? Yeah, look, I understand. You want pictures, and that's what you'II get. The cool underwater stuff. Of course I've got permission. L've got all the permits I need. - Shit. - Dan! No, not you. Marcia. Marcia. Marcia, hello? - Dan! - Marcia? Marcia? This is Teresa Borgia reporting from the Debaria Dam on the occasion of the 40th anniversary of the flooding of this dry valley. Now there is a new air of optimism in the area. Local people look for an economic boom with an increase in tourism and return revenue for local business. Hey, you! Get out of the shot! Oh. Sorry. Now, 40 years later, Debaria celebrates the building of the dam that brought prosperity to the dry valley. Okay, and cut. That was a good take? Yeah, sure. Okay. How are we doing for time? Oh, got to wrap it up now, Teresa. Okay. But I need at least one more shot from the water. CNN won't buy a piece without more angles. CNN, huh? Yeah. Well, it's a spec piece. You're not from around here, are you? No. What, you're a photographer? Hmm? Photojournalist. Doing a piece on the town that drowned. And the celebration. Yeah. Maria. Oops. Hello, baby. Mom, something horrible's happened to Antonio. What? He was in the water. I think he just drowned. Oh, my God. We're in Los Olmos Cove. Okay, listen, I'II be right over. Okay? Okay. Guys, you might want to come along on this. - Los Olmos Cove. - Okay. See you. Bye! Engineer's office. Get Porquillo to the phone. He needs to hear this. Putting you through. Please hold. Porquillo, we've got a problem. - Hello? - Julio. - Hello! - Julio. Rosa? Rosa. You're spineless, Julio. In trouble again, are you... now that I'm not around to bail you out? Not around? You're dead! Stop! I blame you, Julio. That's negligence. Then bye-bye, job. Bye-bye, pension. Who'II look after you then? You can keep a secret, can't you? Julio? Porquillo. Oh, excuse me. L'm sorry. Julio, what's the problem? Oh, no, no, no. Everything's fine. Nothing's wrong. Nothing at all. Nothing at all. Mom, it wasn't normal, what happened. I think it's the lake. It was an accident, Clara. Just a terrible and tragic accident. I don't like this place. Granddad's dead, so why are we still here? I want to go back to London. Give it a chance, honey. I was born here. And I've got a job. Why don't you ever listen to me? I do, honey. I do. Guys! It's time to work. Come on. Mayor Luca. Do you have any comments about this unfortunate event? God damn it, Teresa. Shut it off. - Just stop it. Later, Teresa. Later. - But... I'II talk to you later, okay? Okay. Cut. Please. Take this. Find anything yet? So far, nothing. It... The body, I mean... will pop up eventually, right? The body'II probably surface sometime tomorrow. No problem, then. Bodies tend to pop up quickly, Luca. Gasses build up and... they float. That is, unless something else happens to them. If they're punctured, they get soggy. Just find it. I don't want anything getting in the way of the celebration. I don't think they'II get in the way of the celebration, Mayor. - They? - The police dive team. They're coming in from Madrid. Tomorrow. Dive team? There's no reason to make a big thing about this. Excuse me, sir. The show must go on. Please, Teresa. If you want, shoot. Okay. Line it up. Our primary concern is to do everything in our power to find your son. Hey! You got something? No, Captain. Just a funny wave. Captain! Wait a minute! What are you doing? Get out of here. Go! Get out of here. - Get that rig over here. - Hell of a current down there. Who are you? Dan Quarry. You know, I saw something really strange down there. Like a crack in the wall of the dam. What are you, some kind of engineer? Nah. L'm a photojournalist. L'm working on the story of the sunken town. Got swept away by a current. And a boy disappeared where you showed up. Hey! I didn't have anything to do with that. Officer Gonzales, take him into custody. No, he's right. I saw him at the dam right before my daughter called. He'd just arrived, so he couldn't have had anything to do with Antonio's drowning. - You sure about that. - Yeah. Absolutely. So you won't be needing this? You can have it back when I see your diving permit. So, no permits, huh? It's a spec piece. L've got a deadline. And there's a story here. Really need to get my camera back. Listen... thanks for the ride. And being my alibi. Any time. I owe you one. Clara. Sorry about what happened to your friend. I know what it's like to lose someone. Who is that? Ah. That's Gambine, the supervisor. He never leaves. Interesting. Julio? Julio? Julio. This is Mr. Quarry. He's a reporter. What do you want? L'd like to go down into the dam, if I could. It's not a good time. Please. Julio, please. This is the main wall. of reinforced concrete... which supports the pressure of 18 kilograms of water - per cubic centimeter. - This place feels like a tomb. Watch your step. Mom? This happen often? Every few years... there's a small quake. That wasn't so small. There's a fault line about 3 kilometers from here. Great place to build a dam. Bet there's more than one body buried in these walls, huh? It was a rush job, yeah? Workers... actors... Rush, rush, rush. Big hurry. Better move everybody out of town... make a reservoir for all the big developments right now, can't wait. Even flooded the cemetery, didn't they? Uh. No time to move the dead. L've got family down there. Go back 500 years. Why? Why they're in such a hurry to bury muddy mud under a million tons of water? They needed water for the valley, to modernize. Bullshit. It's all about money. Sleazy politicians. This town's as dirty as they come. No! You can't go down there. Why not? - What are you looking for? - What are you hiding? You don't know anything about this town. My father was an honest man. - Dan? - Yeah. - You sound like shit. - Oh, Marcia. - Hi. - Did I wake you up? Yeah. No, no, no, no. Been awake for hours. What's going on? It's all set up. No problem. L've already met the chief of police. Very cooperative. The clock's ticking, Dan. Yeah, I know we got a deadline. L'II e-mail the photos to you by the end of the day. Don't let me down. - Yeah. Sure. - Bye. Bye. Mom? No! Inat genesis semen mortis est. No! Leave me alone! Clara! He's coming! He's coming. Look at you now, living with the worms. While the maggots feed on you, I will take everything you created... your town, your people, even your own family. After 40 years of waiting, it will all happen in just one day, and all that was yours will now be mine. Most of them are nuts. Absolutely nuts. Come back! Come back! Carlo! This for diver 1. For both... What do you think happens to you when we die? Nothing. Nothing? You just don't exist. You just don't care. You don't care about anything. What's the matter, honey? - Where have you been? - What? And where were you this morning? You're always gone. Honey, I have to work. You know that. You don't care about me, and I don't care! Hey. Dreams and Mysteries. Pretty heavy stuff. Inat genesis, semen mortis est. That which created you... Holds the seeds to your destruction. My Latin's a bit rusty. It's something my grandfather taught me. I have to go baby-sit. There you go. - Be careful, yeah? - Yeah. She's been upset since her grandfather died. Her grandfather, yeah? Yeah. He was the mayor. Remember? That sleazy politician that built the dam? Hey, I didn't mean to insult your family. That's okay. Just forget it. Listen. Help me with this police chief. - What? - I need to get my camera back. Yeah, that's no problem. Teresa, what are you doing here? Captain Keller, I think we got off on the wrong foot. Mr. Quarry's writing a story about the anniversary. It'II be good for the town. L'm still waiting to see your permits, Mr. Quarry. Then you can have your camera back. All due respect, sir, but your man doesn't know a buoy from a diving belt, and I definitely don't have time to teach him how to use the P.R.C. Radio. I can operate a P.R.C. L'm a trained diver, and I know these waters. I can help. We're in luck, Lieutenant. This guy can do it. All right. You can go. But this is against my better judgment, Quarry. Fucking woman. Fucking woman. Julio. No! No, no! Rosa, no! No! No, Rosa. Julio. Oh, no! Get away! Listen up. Be careful down there. Caught some really mean currents last night. Pulled me right across the lake. Here is the dive plan. One: Nice and slow. We have plenty of air. Two: Don't lose sight of each other's ass. - Not that I like his ass at all. - So fucking immature. And three is for you, Devil Dan: Don't fall asleep. You are our guide. Okay. Listen. Do you feel it? It's damned cold down here. No! No! No! Julio! Come with me! No! How we doin', fellas? There's the town of Marienbad. I don't see any sign of the body. The currents tend to pull things down into the buildings. Look. The cemetery. Dan, we are heading across the plaza. You'II feel a strange current there. It will pull you. Just roll with it. How we doin', fellas? Okay? Thank God you are here. Hi. My little monsters await you. - Sorry I'm late. - Don't go, Mommy. But I have to, darling. It will be fun with Clara. - You'II see. - Come, David. - We'II make popcorn. Right, Clara? - Sure. I don't want popcorn. Hey! How about a ton of popcorn, till you got popcorn popping out of your ears like a pop, pop, popcorn machine? Don't go, Mommy. They are all yours, Clara. L'II be back around dark. I hate you! Hey! Come on. - David. David... - No! Let go of me! David! Can you see a house? We see it. Okay. With the strange glow? Okay. You feel that current? Look at that glow. Must be geothermal. L've never seen one that bright before. L'm going to check it out. Look out for me. Okay. Got it. L'm going in. Ruso, Eduardo, come in. Can you hear me? - Come in, boys. - I copy you, Dan. We're checking out that old house you told us about. What the hell is that? Eduardo? Ruso? Ruso? Come in. Eduardo, Ruso, come in. Are you receiving me? Is there a problem? Lieutenant? Can you hear me? Can you hear me, Ruso? Come in! Eduardo, are you receiving me? Ruso, come in! Eduardo, get out of here! Eduardo, come in. Ruso? Look! Get the camera and come on. What happened down there? You all right? Geez! What is... It's the guy from the dam. Gambine. Where'd you find it? It just came up. It was like a black cloud covering everything, and you could feel it sticking to your body. - L've never felt anything like it. - Where? - Hey! - Hey! Hey, Ruso! - Hurry up. Go after him. - Sit down. Over there. Ruso! No! No! Deep incisions... ...as well as powerful ripping. Some kind of animal? Or a propeller? That's it. He got caught up in the propeller. A terrible accident. He was nowhere near the propeller. We felt nothing. What the hell do you know? You're just a fucking cop. It was an accident. He got caught up in the boat's propeller. Let's not file this until tomorrow after the celebration. Okay? Wrap those things up and take it to forensics. Okay, let's finish up the statements and move everybody out of here. Okay. You heard the captain. Let's move on out. What did this is no animal. And it's no goddamn propeller. Some very powerful currents down there. Nobody makes a fool out of me. And the next time I see you in this town, I'm gonna lock you up and make sure you stay locked up. Not a problem. L'm out of here. I just need my camera back. Ah, yes. Your camera. Thanks. You want your camera. Here's your fucking camera! Now, get the hell out of here. What was that all about? He's lost the plot. Thinks I'm the bad guy. He thinks you had something to do with it? I just think it's time to get out of Dodge. What about your story? I was never really close to a story. Listen, when they flooded the town, two boys were there. One of them never came back. So, what happened to the other kid? He doesn't live too far away from here. Samantha, where's David? He's playing. David? Oh, God. David? Okay. Yes. Well, where have you gone? David! Don't hide from me. There you are. - Wait, please. - Oh, David. What are you doing? Why are you... Okay. Come on. Let's go. Let's go. Okay. Okay. But, Clara, we were going to play. Who? Wh-Who were you playing with, David? We... We have to go now, honey. - I want Mommy. - Hey, you've got me now, okay? - And I'II never leave you. - You promise? I promise. I promise. Come on, sweetheart. When you dive, you usually see fish, algae, or something. But down there in the old town, there was nothing but that black muck... a feeling of the total absence of life. L've felt it before... in a frozen lake, when I lost my son. L'm so sorry. One crack, and he fell under the ice. When I got to him down there, there was only death. Nothing else. I handed his lifeless body to his mother. And our marriage... what was left of it anyway... was over. L'm sure you did what you could. Well... You think your lungs are gonna burst. Your body's startin' to pass out. So you go up for air. I know. L'm a trained diver. I know. You got 30 seconds before your body passes out. Long enough to save your son's life. Clara? Is anything wrong? Yeah. Just through there. Why? What is it? Oh, my God. Did anything happen to him? L'II be there as soon as I can, okay? Okay. Bye. Bye-bye. Clara? Yeah. She's a little scared. Do you want to go? No, no. Let's do this first. It's just that I've never been able to... to give her a real family. Maybe because I never knew one myself. You know, when I was 12, my mother dragged me off to London. She said she couldn't live with my father in this town anymore, so... when she died... I was so alone and scared. Oh, God. We will all die. When the dam breaks, it will wash us all away... all the way to hell. What are you doing here? Whoa, soldier. Calm down. Luis, I'm Teresa Borgia. - Mayor Borgia's daughter? - Yeah. You came to help me? To vanquish him? Well... Luis, we want to talk to you about... about Teo. Oh. Teo. No. No, no, no. No Teo. No Teo. No. If I tell you, you'II help me? Damn. What the hell? There's something I'd like you to do for me, Captain. Who are you? It's all here. L've kept everything. Forty years ago, there was a huge scandal. He didn't do it. He was my father. He didn't do it. Oh, he did it, all right. But not for the reasons they say. So it wasn't a corrupt deal, was it? Borgia and his gang owned the land below the dam, all the land that the barrier is built on. So it was a real estate scam. That's how he did it. But why he did it, that's a different story. Borgia spent his whole life fighting them. And he's probably still fighting from beyond the grave. Clara. Clara! Granddad? Clara? Come to me. When I die, he'II come for you. Clara, don't submit. You have the power to resist. Inat genesis, semen mortis est... Granddad? Granddad, don't die. Granddad. Granddad. Somebody's at the door. Oh, God. Susana. What do you do when you never got the chance to say 'I love you'? What's the matter, Susana? How can I let him know I care? L'm sure he knew it. Poor, cold Clara. Good-bye. It's me and Teo. L've spent my whole life trying to understand it. It's in front of your nose, if you want to look. Times were bad in Marienbad except for a privileged few, like Mordecai Salas and his club. Salas met a disciple of Aleister Crowley who initiated him in the practices of dark magic. During one of these rituals, the disciple died. No one knows what happened. But when Salas came back, he brought a book with him, and he seemed like a different person. He wrote the spell in blood and sealed it in the book. It gave him a power. An occult power. The power to call forth the hideous flame. After that, the club prospered even more. They owned the town. First, they helped many people. But then things went sour. For every benefit, there was the devil to pay. No! No! A black slime started to spread that infected the townspeople. They stopped going to church to join the new cult. Lust, madness, and murder took over the town. The atrocities multiplied. Even the dead crawled out of their graves. Cannibalism and self-mutilation had become common practices. Come on, little girl. The crimes of the club were inhuman. Come on. L'm not going to hurt you. No one was spared by the evil flame. No! L'm home! Clara? David? Clara? Hey, sweetie. David! Clara! Where is he? I don't know. We fell asleep and... I told him not to go out. You stay right there with Samantha! Don't leave the house. And don't let her out of your sight. David? What? What is it? Help! Help! Where is Mommy? David, where have you been? Oh, God. Mrs. Martin! Mom! Mom! It was a purely evil entity that Mordecai Salas called up from the beyond that infected the whole town. That's why your father built the dam: To drown the evil town in the water in order to extinguish the flame forever. Get out! No! No! Borgia did what he had to do in order to save the people of the town. Get thee behind me, Satan! He trapped the members of the club and chained them. Borgia buried the book in holy ground to weaken Salas and the power of the flame. If only Teo and I hadn't gone that day, the running water would have sealed it, stopped it. Salas got away. All my life, I hid and lay in fear, looking for signs to protect myself! To keep him away! I knew Salas would come back as soon as your father died. And the dam will break... and Marienbad will rise again and consume us all... unless we stop him! - We have to be going. - Yeah, we have to go. But you said you'd help me. L'm sorry. No! No, Luis. Luis... Teo was my best friend. Antonio! Wherever you are... ...I hope you have all the beer you want! We didn't even have the chance to say good-bye. Maybe this can be our last swim together. Antonio? Today we celebrate the 40th anniversary of the Marienbad Dam! And the birth of our fair town of Debaria! Let the festivities begin! Music! Where are we going? My favorite comic was Captain Lightning. He had justice on his side and a sword in his hand. Good always won... - in the comics. - Go! It's him! Salas! Luis, my odd friend. How can I repay you for what you and your little chum did for me way back then? You son of a bitch! You... killed... Teo! You let Teo die, Luis, and for that, you must be punished. No. You do know that there is a dance tonight: The 40th anniversary of our time together. But I'm afraid your dancing days are over. We can kill this big worm! Inat genesis... semen mortis est. The book! The book! The book... Hey! Just forget about this. It's none of your business. You've got things to do elsewhere. You're a pathetic, drunk coward. You let your own son drown. And you, Teresa Borgia... a cheap whore who neglects her own daughter while she chases men. Your father was ashamed of you. All that remains is your daughter, and she will be mine. No! Are you okay? Are you okay? Take the car and go and find Clara. What about you? Inat genesis semen mortis est. What? That which created us holds the seeds to our destruction. I think I know how to stop him. Go. Okay. Okay. Let's go to the VIP tent. To Marienbad! To Debaria! To her! Where are you going? L'm going to go find your mom. Go back inside. Don't leave me. L'm scared. Come on. Oh, my God. Oh, my God! Are you okay? I didn't see you. Oh, God. Mrs. Martin? Mom? Mom? Mrs. Martin? Mommy! Mrs. Martin? Mom! Mrs. Martin! Mrs. Martin? Where are you? Mommy! Mrs. Martin? - David. - Mom! - David. - Mom! Mommy? David! David! You okay? You okay? Let me see. What? I heard Mommy. Mommy? Where? Where did you hear Mommy? David... David. David! - Let's go! - David! What are you kids doing out here? Their mother, she went out looking for David, and she didn't come back, and... What are you doing out here after dark? - Run! - Come back here! Run! I kneel before you, Sister! Go! Go! Go! Go! That will be all, Captain. So young and so strong. You've inherited your grandfather's spirit. You were the one I wanted, Clara. Unit 2-5, can you hear me? Over. Is anyone there? Anybody listening? Hey... Clara? Hello? Hello? You're under arrest! Huh? It's your choice, Clara. Nothingness... or survival. True life. Do you want to know what death is and what comes after? Everything goes dark and silent. No taste, no smell... no feeling. All your senses fade. You will still be aware. You will still think, but only briefly, until even that fades away. Till even that fades away, and you are no more. You just don't exist... ...don't exist. Open the book! Summon the dark. But you are special, Clara. Not like the rest of them. You can choose to survive. Accept the living flame. Love and adore it. Love and adore it. I don't want to die. Then you must leave them behind. Clara! Don't go! Daddy. Samantha! David! Where's Clara? She's there. There! Clara! Leave her alone! Take me instead! Come, Clara. Only death is your enemy. Just a few moments more, and a fire from beyond will be released. The dam will break, and Marienbad will rise again, bringing a world of lust and violence. And we will never die. - Turn over! Turn over! - No! My baby boy. Move out of the way, Clara! Leave me alone. Please don't burn the book, Daddy. Please don't burn the book, Daddy. Don't burn the book. Don't burn the book. So young, so strong. Clara, don't you submit. You have the power to resist. And so dead. No! Don't burn it, Daddy. Don't, Daddy. Stay with me. Stay with me. Daddy, please. Yeah! No! Mom! No! Mommy! Help me! Help me! Is Clara coming back? I don't know. What am I doing? I feel so bad. Oh, my head. Oh, my head. Dan? Clara? Tell me she's not dead. Baby, come on. Oh, my God. Come on, Clara. Come on, baby. Thank you. Oh, thank you. I hate them. Subtitled By J.R. Media Services, Inc. Burbank, CA
