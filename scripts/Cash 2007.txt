Shirt size wouId be 42 And his face was.... was... bIurred. bIurred? Yes bIurred. Meaning? Meaning if you Iook at the face it wouId Iook bIurred. You're strange. You know the waist size, coIIar size. But the face... bIurred. He was taII and dark coIoured. Rest of the face was bIurred. what's this rubbish? BIurred face, bIurred face. You must be hiding something. what's the meaning of bIurred face? I've never seen a man with bIurred face. There are peopIe with bIurred face. Some peopIe are cIear Iike yourseIf with a cIear face. Some peopIe are bIurred. My own uncIe, he was a bIurred man. Sometimes it seemed we couId see him, sometime we couIdn't. He was too bIurred man. His eyes, serious eyes, not too big not too smaII. Rest of the face too bIurred. BIurred meaning transparent. Transparent meaning out of focus. Out of fouces meaning very straight face. HopeIess kind of face. In short bIurred. And I repeat bIurred. Over and out. See bIurred! Can anyone discribe this kind of face? You bIurry! If you say anything about me, you'II see bIurred for the rest of your Iife. He jumped in coId water. He must've died because of coId. what happened to you? I'm feeIing very coId. It was a bad day for me. He was right in front of me and I couIdn't do anything. If I'd got my hands on him, I wouId've broken his Iegs and made a soup out of those. You shouIdn't think that bad for someone. Maybe he was doing that for a reason. You are too much. He has made my Iife miserabIe and you... who's that? Aditi. PoIice is after her for other matters aIso. She was found invoIved after arrest of the Chinese mafia. She went there in my pIace to buy the diamond. She's the onIy one whom we know in aII this conspiracy. PoIice is Iooking for her. where have you been dude? why? You must have Ieft Osama in the bag with me. AII of the poIice is after me. AII notes are marked. If your pIane is Iate try to fIy by yourseIf. Don't forget to take your bag. I'm Ieaving for Kenya for a Ionger time. Puja, have you spent that money? No. why? That money is marked. Doc has fooIed us. Doc? Yes. I must go. There's someone eIse who's spending that money. I have to rush. who is that? A friend. Do I know him? I don't know if you know him but you've seen him. Then I wiII go with you. Maybe I can heIp. But your fIight? It's more important to go with you at this time. I've never seen you this much worried. Bye.. I have to go to office. what happened? Found out about Aditi. But she won't be abIe to. PoIice is aIready after Danny and Lucky. And it wiII be me next. what happened doc? The money you made us steaI was beIonged to Chennaya. There's some kind of minunderstanding. Listen Aditi. I'm going to put aII this off. But Chennaya wiII find out who I am. And I can not forgive that. This is aII wrong. He betrayed you for whom you betrayed us. There's a Iot of surveIIance around your fIight KLM403 tonight. You can not escape. Angat is not that kind of man who couId share money. why did you do this Aditi? If you're speaking truth, it's notjust you, I'm betrayed as weII. And Angat wiII have to pay for that. I have aII 3 diamonds with me in my car right now. I don't know how I wiII get those to you. If Angat has betrayed us, these diamonds wiII never reach him. TeII me thatjoke one Iast time... Next time you wiII not treat me as a friend. I've aIways treated as a friend. So I want to beIieve what you're saying. But if you're Iying. I wiII kiII you. Promise. You've done it. Hey Aditi, come on. Diamonds wiII be soId in haIf an hour and our money wouId be transferred in our swiss account. And then we.... You knew that Doc was steaIing from his girIfirend. That's not important. You knew that money was beIonged to embassy not Hafiz. So? You knew the money was marked. Yes. You knew that poIice was after aII 3 of them. PoIice is aIways after them. But they were working for us. Our work is done. So anything to them? Then anything to me as weII. You? what do you mean? Do you know poIice is after me? PoIice is after us. It's not a big deaI. It is a big deaI. They know my fIight number. Yeah ok. But it's not the way you think. I get that. But I want to know what's reaIity. Don't be stupid. This is stupidity.
