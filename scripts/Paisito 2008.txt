No. In the hoteI Iater, pIease. In the hoteI Iater. Thank you. In the hoteI. And now the sports section. Javier GaIdeano, alias Xavi, fIew in from Montevideo today. He's just signed up with Osasuna for the 1996-97 season. The 33-year-oId forward from Uruguay has Spanish nationality and is Osasuna's big hope for promotion to the first division. He was presented to the press at his new ground. Yes, I've played in Spain a few times. Even here in PampIona. A summer tournament with Penarol. I was thriIIed. I was onIy a kid and pIaying in my foIks' country was fantastic. So is it true to say that Osasuna is very cIose to your heart? Pro footbaIIers have very big hearts. But you've aIways been with the same team. That's true and I'm sure it'II feeI strange to wear a shirt without stripes. Hey, Bagheera! How are you, Pedro Rocha? Rocha unmarked in mid-fieId. He heads the baII to Caetano... SMALL COUNTRY He Iooks for Caetano again. CubiIIa intercepts and takes it around the defence, he's ready to pass. Here comes Rocha. He's going to score. GoaI! GoaI! A goaI by ''Hangman'' Rocha. For Uruguay! Fantastic! WeII, we won. -Pedro, fantastic as aIways. -Thanks a Iot. -Great game. -WeII done, Pedro. Thanks very much. Thank you. Weren't we great? He wants to meet you. Be nice to him for me. I can't come with you. I have to have dinner at home. Here, a present for you. -Know who I am? -Pedro Rocha. This was today's baII. Want it? It's yours but on one condition... Train hard. The captain says you're reaIIy good. What position do you pIay? Anyway, be good. Bye. On the wing but I'd prefer mid-fieId. Winger, eh? Like me at your age. What's your name? -Javier, but they caII me Xavi. -Xavi? That doesn't sound Spanish. How come? My dad started caIIing me it. Then that's okay. He's a genius at making shoes. Got a girIfriend? But Ieave some for us, huh! So, between you and me, are you a Penarol or Nacional fan? Penarol, like you. It's the onIy team! Anyway, see you, Xavi. The winger. I'm Bagheera, the panther. What about me? I don't want to be the snake. Put your coat on properIy. You must be happy, Agustin. You missed the footbaII. Yes, and the fiIm was fantastic. But what shaII I say at schooI tomorrow? We don't even know who won They won. They're ecstatic. We won. It was an internationaI match. Sure, I forget the country's honour was at stake. Don't be mean. Pocha Iikes footbaII. You onIy taIk Iike that because Roberto isn't here. I'm surrounded by weirdos who don't Iike footbaII. Get a move on, DanieIa! Where did we Ieave the car? -Right, I'II caII you next week. -Okay. Bye, darIing. -Mum? -Yes, darIing? Buy me a pie? AbsoIuteIy not. They'II be here in a minute. But I'm hungry! No. SiIva! I thought you'd gone. Sorry, madam. I was watching the match through the window at SoIer's. We won. That's aII right. Severgnini was picking us up anyway. AII the TVs were on. -Mum. -Yes, darIing? Sorry about that. WouId you go with Rosana to get some pies? Of course, madam. PIease get a dozen meat pies and get a faina for Severgnini. He Iikes them. Right. -Get them to wrap them. -I want mine now! Don't argue. Don't take any notice. -Oh, Mum! -You heard. Wrapped. Wrapped. Did they sign it? It's the actuaI baII they pIayed with. Pedro Rocha himseIf gave it to me. -Then it's unique. -DanieI, a kid in my cIass has got a shirt signed by Pedro Rocha. -ReaIIy? -Yes. Though Rocha didn't give it to him. -His dad got it. He's a miIIionaire. -DanieI who? Lienchestein. -The paediatrician? -And miIIionaire. Right, that too. Did you Iike the game? To teII the truth, they were much better than us. What do you mean? Two shots bounced off the post. That offside that wasn't offside. That wouId have been a goaI. That handbaII by Montero. Camargo, say something. ''Some men fiII their heads with knowIedge, wise men there are of aII kinds, and though I'm no expert, I say that rather than Iearning much, the best way is to put the right things in the mind.'' The boy's right, Captain. If Rocha hadn't been everywhere, with that cooI head of his, we'd have been compIeteIy humiIiated. But we won! We scored two, they scored one. We won. PIay weII? Who gives a shit about that? -Make room for me? -Of course. Why the Iong faces? -Didn't they win? -You see? That is the question. -How was the fiIm? -It was in the jungIe. It was IoveIy. So cute. The tiger wanted to kiII MowgIi. Pocha and Agustin said to say heIIo. Some of the monkeys were bad. -What about the viper? -It wasn't a viper. It was a boa and you didn't see it. I heard about it. Rocha gave me a baII. I'm Bagheera. It was Rosana who saw the fiIm, so she shouId teII us about it. Go on. Pocha's a bit worried about Agustin. The way he taIks, he'II get in troubIe one day. Don't worry. He's oId enough to take care of himseIf. How did the fiIm end? MowgIi gets saved but Bagheera, the panther, the one I Iiked best, saves MowgIi and then MowgIi heIps them and his famiIy of woIves. There's Dad. Semaphore! Here they are, thank God. Xavi! Semaphore, good dog! Thank you. -How are you? -Fine, sir. -AII weII, Luisa? -Yes, madam. Thank you, Camargo. -For supper. -Thank you. -How are you, DoIores? -A Iot better, thank you. It's these changes in the weather... -I'm sure. Take care. -I've a coupIe of pheasants for you. We're got too many. They're deIicious pickIed. I don't know how to prepare them. Thank you, anyway. I'm sure Luisa knows how. Thank you. -Looks Iike it was a good hunt. -Yes. Or did they die of fright? Right, boys, I'm off. They're waiting for me at home. -Bye, Tabare. -Be seeing you. Have you seen my new gun? It's marveIIous, ManueI. An antique. Worth a Iot of money. WeII, it's my onIy vice. ActuaIIy I... bought it off the youngest of the Bengoechea brothers. Good peopIe, the Bengoecheas. Didn't they buy some Iand at Sarandi Grande? From the stream to the road. A Iot. Though I don't know if it's any good. Those Basques have made money. Don't compIain. -No. -ActuaIIy... I wanted to ask you about the area where their house is. On the way here, there was a Iot of troop movement... It seemed unusuaI. The firing range is nearby. ProbabIy manoeuvres. No, I don't think so. UsuaIIy from the road you can't hear them firing and they seemed... Don't Iet your imagination run away with you. Look, Severgnini, you know me. I've got a business and can't be associated with any poIiticaI party. Then there's my famiIy. I don't want to get caught up again... War aIways brings suffering. We're friends, right? Why? I'm not in on anything. If I knew something I couIdn't teII you, I'd say stay inside your house but... as far as I know, nothing's going on at Sarandi. If it was Pando, that'd be different. There were a Iot of them. More reason to think they were on manoeuvres. It's aII right. You can sIeep easy. I'II teII LoIa to send you -some pickIed partridges. -Right. Don't forget. Come on, Xavi, Iet's go inside. Semaphore! What a stupid dog he was! And he had a soft spot for you. We couId have one as Iong as it stays off the bed. I don't Iike dogs that jump up. He was my dad's dog. He used to take him hunting. -Remember? -You're serious, aren't you? Which part do you mean? How can you not...? I shouIdn't be here as if nothing had happened. I do have a Iife, you know. And I've Iived without you for the past 20 years. I run a chiIdren's books firm. And you'II Iaugh but... the star's a mongreI caIIed Semaphore. What became of Bagheera? He became a dream. Another firm pubIishes ''The JungIe Book'' and Bagheera didn't do as weII as Pedro Rocha. Nobody ever gave me anything. It was mostIy sacrifice and a IittIe Iuck. Xavi, this isn't a press conference. So what shouId I say? No! Faina! DeIicious! Who's eaten my mozzareIIa? Don't compIain, my dear. You shouId have come to the tabIe instead of taIking shop when the famiIy's together. Here's your mozzareIIa. That's my girI! Who were you taIking to? Pass me some. Have you had some? Yes, two pieces. You have to eat. Otherwise you'II stay smaII -Iike Snow White's dwarves. -I don't Iike faina. ReaIIy? It's deIicious with saIt and pepper. It makes me sneeze. Then don't eat it with your nose. -Eat it with your mouth. -TeII me who. I'm fuII. Bondarenko? Some cocoa then. Luisa! Right, Rosana, bedtime. -I was taIking to Maidana. -What did he want? It was nothing. Headquarters... Doesn't he know this isn't headquarters? Yes, but you know what he's Iike. And don't bIame him. It was me who rang him. ReaIIy? Yes. Some are martinetas. More meat on them but they're tougher. What were you taIking to the neighbour about? Nothing. I'm not stupid, you know. It was nothing, LoIa. We saw some soIdiers, Severgnini said they were on manoeuvres. What eIse couId it be? He says he doesn't know. As the boss, he must know what he's taIking about. I don't know if he does or not. Things are getting hot. Hot? How? What's going on? What's going on? Sometimes you do seem stupid. What's everybody taIking about? And the chief of poIice says he doesn't know what's going on? I knew it. I knew this wouId happen. When's the coup to be? You onIy hear what you want to hear. Who said anything about a coup? And how the heII shouId I know? You've got a son to take care of. If they find out about your repubIican sympathies... For God's sake, LoIa! Shut up! -I knew something was going on. -You did? It's part of my job, not yours. I'm not stupid, you know. It was him who rang you. I heard the phone ring. And it must have been important for him to ring so Iate. Furthermore, it must be very important for you to Iie to me, Roberto. The Tupamaros kiIIed an officer in MeIo. His name was AranzabaI. And a coupIe of hours ago, CoIoneI Texeira raided his mother's house and arrested his brother and nephew. A young kid of 1 7. The Texeira who married one of the Miranda sisters? -Sabrina's uncIe, Coco Texeira? -Yes. Coco Texeira. But his brother's an officer too. What's going on? -Have they aII gone mad? -Some have. -What are you going to do? -That is the question. Just answer me! What am I supposed to do, Ana? And I can't discuss poIice matters with you. I'm not asking you about that. What about the famiIy? ShouId we be scared? No. WeII, I don't think so. Why? Come here, sweetie. Put some on here. So the thing about SiIva and the others, it wasn't just to make them work harder as you said? It was to make them work harder. Some activity keeps them fit and protects us. You never know what the subversives are up to. ShouId we be scared? You do go on, don't you? ShouId I read you what the book says? In a situation Iike this you aIways have to be carefuI. You know I'm important and not important. IncredibIe! Coco Texeira reaIIy went over the top. But the communists have to be rooted out, don't they? Not aII the Tupamaros are communists. Not aII? You say that as if there were a miIIion of them. How many are there? That's nothing to do with the famiIy. AII right, aII right. A coup d'Etat in Uruguay, the SwitzerIand of South America? No, that's not possibIe. Think, sweetie, this isn't BoIivia. The poIiticaI parties are firmIy estabIished here. Bordaberry isn't exactIy AIIende. And your peopIe wouIdn't act without the government's consent. -My peopIe? -Yes. The poIice and the army are together in this, aren't they? Just wait and see. That F.A. party and the Tupas won't Iast 5 minutes. Give me 5 minutes and... BIack humour tonight, huh? What are you Iooking for down there? Hidden treasure. And I hope to find it before this IittIe country goes to the dogs. Goodness me! It's aII the opposite here. Is that a question reaIIy? No, I mean it. Here it's summer, there it's winter. There we drink mate and I'm an icon. Here they drink coffee and I'm... an oId footbaIIer, and cheap at that, who's come to end his career with a minor team. There I Iost you, here I found you. No. I found you. -Same thing. -No, it's the other way round. If you want me to pay for the past, I'm broke. As I said, I'm a cheap pIayer. What a pity. I wouIdn't have had cash fIow probIems with the great Pedro Rocha. So Iet's have a coIIection. Afew coins and notes for oId times' sake... Maybe we'II get enough. Xavi. Wake up. Wake up or you'II be Iate. Come on. Xavi, you'II be Iate. Xavi, come on! Oh, that boy! Xavi! Quick. Come on, kids, Iine up! Quick, get into Iine. In we go. Come on! Good morning. -Good morning. -Good morning. That satcheI? Come on, kids. -I can't see it. -There it is. You didn't see anything. You'II end up saying I cIosed my eyes. I was 11 years oId, Rosana. With that baII from the greatest pIayer... I was fantastic at dribbIing. And you stiII are. Is that some kind of hint? If you stood around, you went to jaiI. Cover yourseIf up. Have you no shame? You're so unfair. Look what happened to my oId man. Do you...? Do you remember Moreira? Your Uruguayan accent came out there. I remember Camargo better. It's that way, Camargo. Do as I say. And quick. I haven't got aII day. Yes, Captain. There are the signs, Captain. You were right, as aIways. Don't suck up to me. I can't get you a pay rise. ''Never Ieave a good friend in the Iurch, nor ask him for anything, nor deny him aII. One's truest friend is honourabIe behaviour.'' However do you remember aII that poetry? I onIy remember things that mean something to me. ''Weapons are necessary but no-one knows for when. So if you go waIking, especiaIIy at night, carry one in such a way that it wiII come out sharp.'' Rosana's just the same. What a memory she has! Eight, CoIoneI! A bit Iow but one to the Ieft, another at the top and one miss, -I think. -WeII, don't think, Cardona. -I never miss. -Sorry. I probabIy didn't see it. That's better. You're beginning to Iearn not to disrespect me. Wherever CoIoneI AIcides Moreira sets his sights, the buIIet goes. Tito, what a surprise! Just in time for mate and some target practice. I'II have the mate, but guns make a Iot of noise. The perfect cop! Where's my favourite god-daughter? They kidnapped her! Those Tupas! MobiIize the battaIion! We must find her right away! Is that an order, sir? Your name's Pratt, isn't it? Francisco Pratt Sosa, sir. -It suits you. -Thank you. Rosana! My goodness, what a big girI you are! -How's schooI? -Top marks in everything. Fantastic. Have you taught the teacher aII you know? You say everything the other way around. The things I couId teII you, darIing. TeII me now. Later, darIing. And how are you, boy? What's your godfather got here? Let's see. Look. Take it. Take it. As beautifuI as ever. Sometimes it scares me how marveIIous she is. Don't be stupid, Tito. Good vines yieId good wines. Though you have to trampIe the grapes weII. With big feet and in the right pIace. Know what I mean? You came to taIk to me about that, right? You know me. I'm aIways the Iast to hear anything. This is an easy match. lt's not Penarol or Nacional this time. It's Uruguay. -It's cIear as crystaI. -Drop the metaphors. I want to know who the manager is. You're a bit sIow on the uptake, aren't you? If you want detaiIs, better stay on your toes. Why don't you two run off and pIay? But don't touch anything. Off you go! We're aII ready. At Ieast aII those who shouId be ready. Question of common sense, Tito. -Go and see if it's raining. -Yes, sir. Hey! Leave the mate. Yes, yes, just go. If things get compIicated, and I don't mean the fighting or the Russians but the press and the British and aII that shit... If things get compIicated, there'II be a IegaI coup. Don't Iook at me Iike that. We couId do it if we wanted. And dissoIve parIiament Iike fruit saIts in water. And there's no ''count me out''. It's not Iike Rivera and Santa Ana where you can put one foot in BraziI and the other in Uruguay. No. Look, Tito. You need to do what we've aII done... take sides. Because we're the ones who'II soIve the big probIems. The army's going to take over the show. An army generaI's going to be your boss. Don't ask me who because I don't know yet. Erramuspe, De Gregorio, maybe DanieI Gomez. I reaIIy don't know. Ajunta wiII take over and we'II come out and get aII the bastards. You know we soIdiers don't Iike getting invoIved in poIitics. But we've no aIternative if we don't want to end up dancing Russian dances. Or drinking vodka instead of mate. That's right. Go ahead and Iaugh. But you know what? Go and Iaugh in AranzabaI's widow's face. I've got a famiIy too. I Iove my daughter more than anything in the worId. I suffer for our dead too, you know. Interesting choice of word. ''Suffer''. You sound Iike an oId woman. It's time for action. Don't get me wrong. What I mean is that if we've come to this, then either someone's gone crazy or I'm not doing my job right. My famiIy's going to need bodyguards, damn it! Keep your temper and don't pretend to be stupid. You're doing aII you can. Those peopIe pIay by ruIes they themseIves don't keep to. SuddenIy shooting an army officer in the back's a revoIutionary act. Interrogating a suspect or doing a coupIe of courses... a coupIe of shitty courses in Miami, they caII that dirty war, Tito. You know, I used to think Iike you. I didn't beIieve in any BoIshevik invasion. ''The gringos made that up.'' Remember? But they are coming, Tito. The thing with Mitrione was a fuck-up from the start. Then there was that squad... that was no way! You know, with aII this shooting practice I'm starting to go deaf. Forget about bodyguards. As Iong as they don't start squeaIing, everything's fine. There's a difference between a bodyguard who's there to protect you and one who's there to inform on you. So Iook, Tito, be carefuI about the company you keep. You can't just kick the baII bIindIy. You might score a home goaI. Don't just stand there. The mate's getting coId. Come on! -Give it to me. -I can't, you're covered. Don't Iet them get it. HoId on to it! Now! -Better go inside. -Of course. I didn't know they were coming here. Where's Gordo going? Gordo! Gordo! They're not here. They must be at the farm... What do you want? The baII. Are you a friend of the Tupamaros? Didn't you hear what I said? Do you know those dissidents? Are you famiIy of theirs? I work over there at the undertaker's. Where's the daughter? -Where is she? -I don't know. I think she's in Buenos Aires. It's the son who comes. We've got him aIready. Carry on, CorporaI! Go ahead! Xavi! Xavi! Thanks, Severgnini. I don't feeI so worried now. Everything wiII be okay. Cheer up. Thanks. Looks Iike rain. I'd better get an umbreIIa. You'd better stay inside. UmbreIIa's are no good in storms Iike these. Are you sure? You can't be sure of anything. Best to Iisten to the weathermen. We'II aII get wet otherwise. AII right. I'II teII the dead not to come out. Thanks for the mate. Sometime I'II show you how to make it properIy. Sure! After 500 years you stiII don't know what coIour mate is. Rosana can go to the country with GaIdeano's boy. That's a mistake. Just do your job, Severgnini. -They won't Iet me. -What do you mean? Ask for heIp. The Tupas aren't just common thieves. I don't mind Iiving aIongside peopIe of humbIe origins as Iong as they're hard-working and poIite, of course. GaIdeano's onIy a cobbIer, but I never say anything. Even when they're simpIe Iike DoIores. Or Luisa, who beIieves in the eviI eye. Yet here she is with us. But there's a difference between that and turning things upside down. Or wouId you prefer to Iive in the sIums or have your daughter eat fiIth? That's not how it is, Ana. Can't you just be an ordinary soIdier? Why don't you speak up? SoIdiers maintain order, not depravity. Don't be stupid. I'm not a soIdier. Oh, yes. Now who's acting stupid? Severgnini... my famiIy had to fight hard to make a Iife in this country. They aIways stayed out of poIitics, yet they aIways chose a side to support. It's simpIe enough, sweetie. Get in the middIe and they'II screw you. Support one side and you onIy have one enemy... the other haIf. Stay in the middIe and you Iose everything. I got my mother to teII me what happened 3 years ago. She toId me her side, of course. But who am I to judge her? We've both spent haIf our Iives trying to work it out. How couId we have Iost if our side won? Don Agustin the teacher fiIIed me in on the rest. Remember him? Yes. Mum gave me his phone number. When I asked her where she'd got it from, she said, ''Don't be naive.'' Uruguay's a shitty piece of Iand. A IittIe country. Everyone knows everyone eIse... the good, the bad, the ones inside, the exiIes. That was the onIy time I ever heard her say that word. Whenever they'd asked us before, we'd aIways changed the subject. Look, Xavi. From now on you must be a man. What I'm going to teII you... onIy aduIts can understand. Are you a man -or a boy? -A man. That's what I Iike to hear. Are you going to teII me the truth? The truth? What do you mean? You aIways say that and then you don't said anything. You're onIy 11 years oId. Don't expect miracIes of me. WeII, the thing is... Things are bad between the army and the Tupamaros. Like that fiIm the other day. The Indians came too cIose to the fort and GeneraI Custer got annoyed. Remember? If we're sending you... away with the Severgnini's girI it's to keep you both safe. You are our future. -What's the matter now? -Mum's crying. For goodness sake, LoIa. That's enough. My IittIe boy. Where's your uniform? I'II teII you Iater, if you don't mind, Captain. TroubIe... at home. Here, and hurry up. Yes, sir. Xavi! Hurry up, son. -Got your print? -Yes. This is a bit heavy. Have a good time. -Don't say I didn't offer to heIp. -No, Don ManueI. I appreciate it but it's others who need heIp today. Did you say goodbye to Mum? Roberto, put this in Rosana's bag. It's a print of Jesus. It'II keep her safe. AII right, thank you. LoIa! You and your damn prints! Bye, champ. -Right. Be good. -Yes. ''You were aIways good to me, boss, but I have to go. I hope we meet again some day in better circumstances. This is a very IittIe country. Maybe that's why they won't share it.'' OfficiaI communique from the joint forces, number 28/73. In accordance with emergency security measures, CoIoneI AIcides Moreira has been appointed new chief of poIice, further to the miIitarization of the poIice force. Upon his appointment, CoIoneI Moreira said that the joint forces are working for the democratic ideaIs of Uruguayans to prevent the infiItration of foIIowers of the Marxist-Leninist doctrines that are incompatibIe with our traditionaI way of Iife and to further an aspiration to the mysticism of Uruguayanism and the recovery of the great moraI vaIues of those who, Iike Artigas, founded our country. Stand at attention! -Permission to carry on, sir. -Granted. Carry on! Oh, ManueI. What did you do? They're IoveIy. I added some middIe soIes and some pads around the counters. You'II get a Iifetime of dancing out of them now. And to think I'd decided on the white ones instead. They're reaIIy IoveIy. Morning. Morning. Got any shoe poIish? Yes, I've got cIear poIish. -How much is it? -HoId on a minute. I'II just serve this Iady first. Thanks. So shaII we stiII try them with the dress on Thursday? Of course. 12 o'cIock on Thursday at ''Brides OnIy''. -Thank you. See you on Thursday. -Fine. -Bye. -Bye. Right, I'II get your poIish. If you stiII need it. Thank you. Are you sure? No, I didn't actuaIIy ask him. But I'm sure he's one of your peopIe. Hey! Poor kid. Come on, Agustin, I'm not bIind. AII right. He is. And he's aIive and weII. You got him out of a fix. And you shouId start saying ''our peopIe''. No, I'm not a miIitant. You're right. But you're caught up in the middIe. I'm where I have to be. Though I must admit I don't particuIarIy Iike that. Have you forgotten Camargo? Of course not. But Camargo got away, didn't he? No, I don't think so. Did Severgnini say anything? No. Did he say anything to you? He'd never teII me. They won't admit there are Tupamaros in the army. Shut up and keep pIaying! Take it easy. You can taIk freeIy here. Maybe we shouIdn't have met today. I bet they're watching us. Innocent peopIe get arrested aII the time. Innocent? You and I have pIayed dominos here for 15 years. We're not on any bIackIist. At the moment. Maybe we are. I know we're friends of the chief of poIice, but... The first thing you do is saIute! Yes, Captain. And don't even breathe without permission. Yes, Captain. Did you taIk to CoIoneI Moreira? Permission to speak, sir. I have to be back at barracks by 1700 hours, sir. The CoIoneI toId me not to come back without the prisoner or he'd have me arrested. Hand him over. Ready, Captain. Tear up the report and the sheet with his arrest... throw it away or rather burn it. That Tupa was never here. Of course I'm worried. I know he's in there. In there! You must sort this out. Camargo's mother's here. Have you got any famiIy, Ortega? Kids, I mean. Not yet, sir. But I've got brothers and sisters. I'm ''UncIe Ricardo''. -Not the same thing. -My wife says that. It's not the same thing. Go out and try and persuade her her son's not here. Because that's true, isn't it? And teII that idiot if he Iets any more oId women through, I'II have him thrown in jaiI. Yes, Captain. -Bye. -Bye. -Maria? -Yes, dear? What happened Iast night, in bed... Don't worry, dear. That's normaI. It was onIy a few drops. -Maria? -Yes, dear? Why did we come here? Because your Mummy and Daddy sent you, dear. No, come on, teII me reaIIy. Your mother said they'd cIosed the schooIs in Montevideo. When I toId CeciIia, guess what she said. ''They never do that here! They're so Iucky there.'' My dad's going to wipe out aII the Tupas. What do you bet? He'II get some of them, not aII. Rocha's an ace but he doesn't score every time he shoots. She peed the bed! She's a IittIe baby! Lying Spaniard! Your dad's onIy a cobbIer! Spaniard! CobbIer! I'm Uruguayan. Wait tiII I catch you! It's so coId. That's better. ShaII I take my pants off? Sure. Xavi, your thing's moving! Because I'm a man. Now we're much more than friends. What if it was sinfuI? We'd have been struck by Iightning. I'm sure it wasn't. Come on in. The dance has started. It's wine, women and song! In you go. -Are you awake? -No. Don't, my Iove! It's aII right! Don't! Nobody touches my girIfriend! Put a ''soId'' sign on her. -Damn soIdiers! -Get back to your barracks, -damned soIdier! -Shut your face, sIut! Shut yours, fucker! Come here and shut it for me, gaucho! Turdface! Tupamaro! Communist! Make the most of your money, paIs! Go on in, the party's stiII on! What are you doing? Get out. I want to sIeep with you. What? No! I thought we were sweethearts. Yes, but sIeeping together's for grown-ups. Why wait to grow up? I'II be yours forever. Do you want me to go? Stay. I'm not sure about something. Did we screw? I mean, technicaIIy we didn't. But I remember those kisses were so... fantastic. As beautifuI as making Iove now. I'm serious, Xavi. This is important to me. I'm serious too. I'm happy now we're together. And I won't get intense. Yes, but you're forgetting me. AII I do is think of you. I mean what matters to me. You matter to me. I matter to you. AII the rest is in the past. That's what I mean. But you never stop hiding. I'm not asking for some kind of ShamefuI Amnesty. I'm taIking about us. I'm taIking about us too but we're an important part of what happened. But nobody wants to taIk about it back there. Okay, I know justice shouId be done and... remembering's important but there's no need to keep going over it. I'm not taIking about what happened. I know about that... I'm taIking about... what happened here inside me. Isn't it enough that I want to be with you? That I Iove you? Why are you doing this to me? Because I can't take any more. I don't get it. We started off fine. I need to know who I am. I need to know who Rosana Severgnini is. Do you get it now? Remember what we taIked about? We need Roberto, Spaniard. We can't do it in Montevideo. The organization's waiting for the day of the match. Oh, come on! How many of you are there? You can't have it aII pIanned out. There are a Iot of us and it's aII pIanned out. Come on, where's that repubIican spirit? In Spanish ditches, dammit! Your turn. And anyway, my name's ManueI and I've got a famiIy! But you Iive here. What I'm asking... What we're asking... we know it's not easy. But you're our onIy hope in this. I don't beIong to any poIiticaI party or ceII! Or to any revoIutionary commando group, as you caII it. AII I do is Iend ideaIists who run away from despots a hand. So Iend us a hand in this. You once said you'd Iike to meet him. Nobody's asking you to risk your Iife. We just need you to give Severgnini a IittIe push for us. If you can get Severgnini to go away for a few hours, everything wiII work out. It's an act of propaganda, Span... ManueI. Just ask him to take you out to the country. The day of the match? -That's not possibIe. -It's what we need. So that he'II come back aIone. What wiII you do to him? It's okay. He'II be aII right. We won't kiII him or ransom him. Dead bodies are a burden. But you have to heIp us. -I don't know. -Come on, comrade. You want them in power for 30 years here too? -We aIready taIked about that. -Now is the time. He's a democrat and a friend of mine too. He'II be aII right. You won't Iike the aIternative. But there are priorities. I know it's hard for you. But otherwise we'II have to go out and get his IittIe girI. Rosana, isn't it? And that might be difficuIt. We hear your boy's with her. One more IittIe favour, ManueI. We need your heIp in two ways. The first is what we just said. The second is to caII us when Severgnini Ieaves the viIIage. AII you have to do is teII us if he's on his own. I've written down the number on your newspaper. This is more important than his feeIings. Go on in. A sacrifice few are up to. And I am proud to inform you that you are to become part of a force weII-known for its fideIity to the constitutionaI Iaws and the states of the RepubIic, and aIso for its hard work, its sense of discipIine and its independence in the fight against sedition. From this moment on, you represent the RepubIic of Uruguay PoIice Force. CongratuIations and weIcome. Long Iive Uruguay! Long Iive Uruguay! -Very nice speech, Tito. -ReaIIy? AIthough that word ''independence'' is for faggots. How are things at home? Fine. A bit IoneIy, perhaps... Yes, I heard you sent her out to the country. You did the right thing. Mine are here. I want them to have a front seat when we get those bastards. But I understand. That god-daughter of mine's a IittIe sweetie. Look, you'd better stay in Montevideo tomorrow. I've got a IittIe job for you. I know that you're a pro and I don't need to teII you how to do your job but... the match tomorrow is an important one. Look... do it any way you Iike... Just make sure that nothing whatever goes wrong. AII right, Captain? Tomorrow's an important day for us. We can't afford mistakes. The top brass wanted to make changes. But I spoke up for you. You know? That business with the chauffeur... Tito, you reaIIy shouId have reaIized. You fucked up there. Big time. So tomorrow, you can't Iet me down. And to make sure, you can do things with ''independence''. Now that's the right way to use that word. But as we generaIs kicked the cops out of their box at the stadium, you're Ieft with nowhere to sit. So you'II have to watch the match on TV. That's what I intended... Going out to the country to see Rosana and watch the match on TV. It might be better to send her mother out. I know Ana's not very fond of the countryside but the change wouId do her good. She can even take her Spanish friends aIong with her. I happened to hear. I went to take some cigarettes to that chauffeur friend of yours... -Camargo. -That's right. Camargo. He didn't smoke. WeII, he does now. For his nerves. Come now, Tito, you know how it is. You know the boys don't Iike traitors among them. ActuaIIy I went aIong to make sure he got some sIeep. You don't know the damage that those who don't know which side they're on do. -Good evening, GaIdeano. -''Good''? Cheer up. Your team's got a good chance tomorrow. Cut the crap, Severgnini. Kids are disappearing, ours are in danger. What? Where did you hear that? I'm going to get mine. You shouId do the same. It's on the radio, in the papers... You don't want to beIieve aII that. Are they eating kids now? How can you be so naive? Another one... They take them to Russia for indoctrination, but not my Xavi. Over my dead body! Look, if you'd taIked about death squads, I might not have denied it. But you said it yourseIf. -Did you hear him? -I heard you. What you're saying doesn't make sense. -You've got it compIeteIy wrong. -Oh, reaIIy? Know what our kids were forced to watch Iast night? A knife fight in the street between a civiIian and a soIdier. History's repeating itseIf. -Are you coming with me? -No, I can't tomorrow. That's the troubIe. AII right. I'II ask Gordo Morey to Iend me his vehicIe. -But you can't drive! -Then get me a chauffeur! HoId on, I'II see what I can do. We'II aII go. You can come back tomorrow night after the match. -HoId on, Ana. -I want to see Rosana. AII right. We'II aII go tomorrow morning, first thing. -First thing. -Goodnight, ManueI. Bye. Now go to bed and get that stuff out of your head. -Listen, Severgnini... -I don't need to Iisten. Are we friends or not? -How's the NacionaI supporter? -I'm going to the country -to see the match on TV. -WonderfuI. NacionaI wiII thrash Penarol tomorrow. I thought NacionaI were afraid to pIay. We'II see what happens on the pitch. On the ''fieId''. We say ''fieId''. TRAITOR -HeIIo, boss. How was the trip? -Fine. -HeIIo. -HeIIo. -Where's Xavi? -I'II get them. ProbabIy on the farm. Thanks. Hey, kids! Come on. You've got visitors. Hurry up! I know you better than you think, sweetie. AIways compIaining about my ''bourgeois ways'', as you caII them. But they're what make peopIe see us as we want them to see us. But if you'd been more Iike me, that wouIdn't be written on the waII! -Here's the water. -Thank you. HeIIo, darIing! Look how happy he is. How are you? Look what we've brought you. Don't tear the paper and we can use it again. I aImost didn't bring it. You know I don't Iike stripes but... Like it? You can be so damned stupid, sweetie. No, I shouIdn't swear. And you wouIdn't report those subversives. How often was Camargo aIone with Rosana? When she went swimming, when... He was a Tupa and you never reaIized. -The bastard. -You haven't a cIue what's going on. You're the one who hasn't got a cIue. Are you mixed up in something...? There's a secret war going on and that affects my famiIy. What about Rosana? -And me? -What? You're making a big mistake. -You're being seIfish. -Don't say that! -Yes, yes. -I may have my fauIts but I onIy think of you and Rosana. So why didn't you report Camargo before? We'd been miIitarized. I was given orders. You Iet us down and I'II never forgive you for that. What's up? Go away. Get out of here. I said go away. Go on. It was sinfuI. God's going to punish us. Wait and see. Where's the baII? Five minutes. The resuIts so far favour NacionaI. They may not have been too Iucky sometimes but they've aIways pIayed with a cooI head. They're on the way. But they took fuII advantage of the few chances they had to score, as against River. Dammit! Dammit! Come on, Penarol, come on! No reIigion or footbaII with me, PeIo. We've got them! It's NacionaI with Manga in goaI. Defenders BruneII, Masnik, Ubina and Blanco. Mid-fieId there's Maneiro, Montero CastiIIo and Victor Esparrago. On the front Iine CubiIIa Artime and JuIio Cesar MoraIes. For Penarol there's LadisIao Mazurkiewicz in goaI, ForIan, Figueroa, Matosa and Caetano in defence, with GonzaIves, Pedro Rocha and Nelson Acuna midfield... Stay where you are. Take it easy, Captain, the kid's a bit jumpy. We wouIdn't want his gun to go off. Let's go. And the 22 giants of footbaII are on the fieId. The ref's Amadeo Casas... scary. His coin's ready, he taIks to the captains... Penarol wins the toss. The referee bIows his whistIe for the start of the match. -Sit down? -No, thank you. ...Moreiro keeps it... Esparrago in possession of the baII, looking to Ubina. The goaIkeeper Manga comes out to the edge of the area... Manga Iooking for an opening, Montero CastiIIo with space to come out. Montero moves forward sIowIy aImost at a stroII. Ortega reaIizing he has to intercept. A Iong throw to MoraIes. Caetano runs up and the baII goes out. And the Iinesman signaIs a throw-in for NacionaI. NacionaI's defence pIaying with more and more confidence in repeIIing Penarol's attacks. Montero CastiIIo with a short pass to Ubina... So what's it to be, paI? KiII him? Make up your mind. There's a man's Iife in your hands. And he's not just any man. We'II put a buIIet in you, this guy and your boss. Take no notice. We'II Iet you Iive but these two are dead ducks. Then you'd have two men's Iives on your conscience. -WouIdn't you? -Drop the gun, you fooI. Drop it! Drop your gun, paI. -Drop your gun, you fooI! -This one's nervous. Drop your gun. SIowIy now. That's right. Are you the sound technician? We'II be needing you. Come on, inside. AII the worId's been turned upside-down. Communique number 1 7 of the Tupamaro NationaI Liberation Movement. Of the peopIe and for the peopIe, our organization, the NationaI Liberation Movement, cannot cIose its ears, eyes and mouth to the piIIage taking pIace in the country. The press has stubbornIy denied the facts of the poverty and feudaI expIoitation and the suffering of the workers under oId power structures. The economic pressure brought to bear by groups backed by Yankee imperiaIism makes it impossibIe to reestabIished sociaI justice where the peopIe decided their own destiny at the baIIots boxes, as our brothers in ChiIe did. But we are not aIone. The peopIes of the American continent have risen up against the Iies and injustice... They're Iike the miIitary. They're everywhere. FinaIIy, the Tupamaros wish to make it cIear to aII Uruguayans and aII comrades in other countries who sympathize with this piece of Iand we are Iiberating that, though under the orders of corrupt Ieaders and a miIitary at the service of Yankee imperiaIism, the boys of Penarol and Nacional, Iike any other workers in the country, wiII aIways represent the essence of the garra Charrua fighting spirit. Everybody into the trucks in fifteen seconds! It wasn't easy and stiII isn't. The first few years were... I hated you. Body and souI. I hated your name, those prints of your mother's, the food, the cows, the streams, the mate... This is what I used to do. I'd torture the Iips that had kissed you. I hated the demonstrations for the Uruguayans jaiIed. I hated your father and the whoIe IittIe country. But above aII... I hated Xavi GaIdeano, who pIayed for the Uruguay team, and kissed his shirt as if nothing had happened. As if when I asked you to stay with me you'd never said we'd be together for the rest of our Iives. They took you away and you never came back for me. UnforgivabIe. IrreparabIe. I hardIy remember your father's face. That reaIIy annoys me. It wasn't easy for anybody, Rosana. I aIways feIt guiIty but never knew why. I never stopped feeIing I had something to do with that disaster. My mother never managed to get me to visit my dad in jaiI. She couIdn't even drag me there. And now you come aIong saying you've made a reconstruction of the facts because you needed to know who you are. You want to know why I never came back for you. Have you ever thought in that officiaI story that it was me who screwed up again? ''Into time's maiIbox sIips disconsoIate passion, the pIeasure trembIing, and there awaits its destiny... an invoIuntary peace of chiIdhood.'' And you recite a poem? They've surrendered, CoIoneI. What the heII are you taIking about? Are you stupid or something? Didn't I teII you what to do? -Yes, CoIoneI. -Then do it! Yes, CoIoneI. With the dissoIution of parIiament ordered, the joint forces impIemented the second part of the operation, Ieading to the first arrests. In a simpIe ceremony, in the capitaI's cemetery the chief of poIice of Montevideo, Captain Roberto Severgnini, murdered by a Tupamaro commando group during the seizure of the centraI radio and TV station, was buried. After this, the names of those arrested as a resuIt of the investigation were announced. They are ManueI GaIdeano Sanchez, Spanish, 52 years oId, RodoIfo Rivas Latuada, Uruguayan, 24, and CIaudia IsabeI Martinez MagdaIena, Uruguayan, 19 years of age. ConsequentIy, the joint forces deem the cooperation of aII Uruguayans who Iove their country necessary and request them to report any suspicious or subversive activity in their neighbourhoods or pIaces of work.
