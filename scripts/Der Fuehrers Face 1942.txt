Caricatures and jokes, not always in the best of taste, rise to the forefront because it's our way of relieving aggression. So it was in World War ll. Some people feared Adolf Hitler. Others mocked him. The Disney staff came up with the idea for a cartoon to be titled, Donald Duck in Nutzi Land. Giving the All-American duck a nightmare that he was living in a country run by Nazis. The title changed when a song written for the cartoon by Oliver Wallace became a runaway hit, in a now classic recording by Spike Jones. It then became essential to change the name of the cartoon to Der Fuehrer's Face. It's easy to see why the film was so popular. It's very, very funny. Reducing the serious tenets of Hitler's Nazism to slapstick absurdities. And it gave audiences a chance to think, as Donald does, about the freedoms they might have taken for granted. Am I glad to be a citizen of the United States of America! Der Fuehrer's Face, directed by Jack Kinney, won the Academy Award as Best Animated Short Subject of 1943.
