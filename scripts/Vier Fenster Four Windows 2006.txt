Had to fight all night with the green-eyed woman. You wanted to watch it. Okay, okay. Don't you want to take a shower? I'll do that downstairs Hey, Papa. Not again such a bloody horror flic. Hurry. You'll be late. Here! Four windows. Good morning, sweetheart. Good morning, sweetheart. Morning. Did you sleep well? I didn't sleep all night. Ooffee? Mom, I have to go. Sure. I'm very busy, too. Oh, I found a water heater. I can clean my apartment myself. Then I woke up of course. Oan't remember when we've seen each other in daylight. The whole world can go under, he doesn't care. And now he's gone again. Thank you. You don't drink coffee. Thatjust makes you nervous. All night I was standing in your room, watching you. It was so cold. It's good that you can sleep so well. I couldn't do that before an exam. But your father doesn't care either. He's already gone again. I make reservations at the restaurant for us afterwards, okay? You don't have to go out with me. For heaven's sake, sit down. I have to go. Do that in the hallway! I call the restaurant, okay? And not so late. Give me a kiss. And don't eat too much before dinner. We're going to have a real good time tonight. Always at the last moment. And good luck with the exam. Bye. I want to see you when you're in there. Will you join us later? Where to? We wanted to go for a drink. Yeah, sure. If there's something to celebrate. Doesn't matter. It does matter. After an exam you're celebrating. I'm afraid. What's your name? Why? Oh boy, oh boy... I would really like to take you home. That's not possible. Turn around. Hot item. I would take good care of you. What are you doing here? You should be snuggled up in clean linens. I would lick you all over. Like a dog. We have time, don't we? I would touch you everywhere. Let's see where there's hair on you. I would fuck you mercilessly, you son of a bitch. I would fuck you and fuck you till you're just whimpering. And then some more. Then you can sob into the pillows. I would even serve you breakfast in bed, my little puppy. I have to go. Oan I help you? I'm just looking. Thank you. I had to wait at home. On call all day long. There could've been something. Why didn't you switch on the answering machine? Just waiting all the time. Your father could have said yes or no. Now we're here. Did the exam go well? No clue. I wasn't there. Nonsense. You're not my brother anymore. Should I take care of him? Don't be stupid. Or do you wanna live with her? That's what you'd like. Yes, sometimes I would. Hello. Hello. What's your name? Oan we meet again sometime? Not possible. Didn't you have fun with me? I gotta go. I have to. Hey, come here. Fuck me. I don't know yet who to take with me. I'm so happy. I can't believe that they still perform. Did you ever hear them? I've read about them. These cocktails are really yummy. I want to have a child with you. Wait a sec'. Where've you been? Don't you wanna come along? No. I hate cooking. I rather go out. But that's expensive. What's your problem? Don't get pissed. Why don't you cook something? You do have time now. What? Like when you were pounding the escalopes. You could do that again. Mom would be happy. The kitchen was a mess! Your masterpiece, announced for days. And then you breaded the escalopes before you pounded them. Okay, they did taste. Well, at least we said so. You always wanted to do it again. You turn paler every day. Look at that dress. Mom would look sexy in it. Do something fun. You can't see it. I don'tjust want to stare into the water all the time, do I? Maybe she likes it. She can do that at the same time. Where else do the girls go to? You wanna screw or dance? I can decide that later, can't I? Ohicks who wanna screw right away are disgusting. I don't think so at all. Just stop by. I hope there are some chicks left for you then. Oan I help you? Where do you wanna go? Here... Good that she sent me the keys. She'll be here soon. Yes, has to. So as I said with the bus no. 100 you can see everything. On the boat it's nice as well. But that's more fun in a bigger group. Anyway, a weekly ticket makes sense. Thank you so much for helping me with all those heavy bags. I liked what I've seen so far. If you live here it's just everyday life. Yes, I see. Vanilla. But a town like this also has some kind of aura. All these theaters, you can really go into raptures. Every corner tells a story. Such dreamy stuff is not my piece of cake. Women are better at that. You think so? They have a better imagination. A man of deeds. With a family you have to be practical. It's this way or that way. Nothing in between. I think a woman feels more secure that way. A man can still have feminine intuition. Artists do have that. You are a surgeon. I can tell from your hands. Really? I mean they can... You remind me of my family doctor. He's very polite. Usually they just treat you like a number. I know. I'm always so tired. It's been a long way. We look at each other and don't say a word. Nobody wants to give up. Then we have to laugh again. Really hysterically. Do you know, when you can't stop anymore? It's important that it's funny sometimes. But my sister can be a real bitch. Isn't that so, Dad? No, she can be really funny. It's important to be funny. She got this from her mother. Really? It's true. To women! To women. To cunts! But she can also be reserved. That's just her way. Don't know. Oome on, it's late. The music is like in the old times. These are our last drinks. Oh no! I always want to watch the sunrise with her. But she just can't do that. Sometimes you have to force them to be happy. It's notjust kitsch what we do. My wife is much softer. Sometimes I gently blow on her neck. She pushes me away then, but I know she's getting goose pimples. I know. That's when my knees start to tremble as well. But somehow I also feel so strong then. Like machos, right? I thought you couldn't get it up. Really? Why don't you ask her? It's not your fault. You're just afraid of women. Fagott. I do make her happy. She never complained. Now she's all grown up. Oome to bed. It's cold. Hey, Dad. Do you live here now? I'm old enough, ain't I? Old's correct. Why are you up and about already? Shit. You still have time. Hello! The lunch menu, twice, please. A hamburger is enough. Hamburger. There's nothing healthy in your fridge. At least I didn't find anything. Didn't even have lunch today. It's super motivating to check your weight in front of everybody. Otherwise you would lie to yourself. What? Did you see that cow's butt? Don't put on the little black dress, that's too loud. And shave your armpits. I did that. No alcohol before. Oauses bad breath. Yes, right, and he smokes like a chimney! I think it's sexy. Well, maybe I get used to it. Is your guy smoking? I hate fat tits. Really? I'm so in love. A bit rouge to your cheeks. You're my best friend. Sugar free. No, thank you. You seem to be lost somehow. But that's nothing bad. I need some time to myself. Your eyes look sad. Beautiful eyes. Are you a model? What do you want? Nothing. What does he want? Old cock. I have to work. You'll get that back. Do you know that you make me madly happy? Yes, I know. So, what's up? My brother's exam? Your mother makes a big fuss about it. I'm done here in a minute. I'm coming. That's fate. You don't believe it. Some things just happen. Mom, don't keep us waiting! I wanted to wait for your father. But I just can't. I'll be too drunk by then. I love you, child. My dear, we're now one family. You're going to be a father. What are you talking about? Here he comes. Hey Dad. You always miss everything. What? Your daughter has to tell you something. What's up? Oome on, I saw the test lying in your bathroom. I always had the little one in tow. I hated that. My friends never had their brothers and sisters with them. Max is a nice name. It's going to be a boy, I'm sure. Mom. What a fuck! If there are any problems, with money, we'll take care of it. We know well enough how that goes. Really, you ate us out of house and home. Eating and crying. And I prepared everything myself. Do you remember? Potatoes and carrots, carrots and potatoes. Spilling everything all over the place. I'll take him during the day. We will all stick together. We had the greatest time back then. Do you remember? Such a tiny thing. It changes the whole world. It starts with the belly. The stuff you fed me! I had to lose seven kilos afterwards. I put oil on my belly. You put your ear to it and tickled me. And I started to yell 'cause I was afraid, laughing would be bad for the baby. But you sure were a handful. Orying all night long. Your father had the patience of a saint. All night long he walked up and down the apartment. And up to work every morning. Yeah, that's how it was. Oh boy oh boy, at first I thought he couldn't handle kids. But with your sister... after a few days she had conquered his heart. Oome on, let's dance. Oome on, please. Oome. Please. No. Sorry. Oome on! Please, come! Oome, we dance! I'd like to dance with you, my sweetie. Please. You wanna fuck me? Right now. I'm a dirty slut. It's for free. You can fuck my ass. I can stand that. You can hit, or punch my belly, just like that. I can give you head. I'm great at that. You can wank between my tits. Oome on, fuck me! You feel like it? You can hit me, everywhere. Oome on, do something. Don't be shy! I can take that. Do something. Fuck me! Do you want to fuck me? Right now. It's cool. Just like that. Take me and hit me. Just the way you like it. We'll have fun. Oome on, fuck me! Where've you been? I was looking for you everywhere. Do you know that you make me madly happy? Oh, please, try the master key once again! My son would have thought of something by now. You know what, I'm going to clean for you now. And by the time I'm downstairs you're in my apartment. O. K? That's a deal. I'll take my time then. I don't know. I can fetch a jacket for you. Really? I'm not cold. Would you like some coffee? Do you have a coffeemaker on you? Thanks anyway. I am so stupid. I did take it after all. Lucky you. Sometimes you're just beside yourself. Oould I use your bathroom, please? Yes, sure. Do you care for some coffee? Do you care for some coffee? Mom? What's the matter? Nothing. What's the matter? Do you think I'm old? Why? You're a young mother. Tell me. What do you think? You're not bashful, are you? Mom. I think everything still looks pretty firm. Okay, it looks better with your girl friends. But tell me. What d'you wanna hear? Don't be shocked. I just wanna know. We're there. Mom. What time is it? It used to be possible. That's not normal. I'm not a hotel. He can take his stuff to the dry cleaner. Others do that. Ohildren keep you alive sometimes. You'll see once you have problems. The little one will look at you. And you know why you're doing all this. In your eyes I've always seen your father. He is the man of my life. That's how it is. I still remember when you were born. I was looking out the window. There was this beautiful light in the trees. And your father was working behind me, lost in thought. I was so incredibly happy. Has there been mail? Morning. Psst! Are they still asleep? Since when are you drinking coffee? So what? What a night. Scrounger. Didn't know you could drink so much. Do you need to catch the bus as well? The Fifty-three. Okay, wait for me. Hurry. We can run. Hello. Stop that nonsense. I can't do it. Take this! It's green. Let's go! Not that fast! We cross over there. Here. Are you going to do something meaningful today? You're the right one to ask that! But it's true. What? Will we still make it?
