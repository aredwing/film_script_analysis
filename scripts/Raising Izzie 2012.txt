THE DOCTORS TOLD US THA THERE WAS NOTHING THA THEY COULD DO TO FIX HER. AND THAT THE ONLY THING THA COULD FIX HER WAS A MIRACLE. SO WE PRAYED FOR A MIRACLE. WE PRAYED AT HOME. WE PRAYED AT CHURCH. GOD NEVER SAID ANYTHING. GOD NEVER DID ANYTHING. SHE WAS GOING TO DIE. BUT DIDN'T YOU HAVE ANY RELATIVES? AN UNCLE, AUNT? COUSIN? IT'S ALWAYS BEEN JUST US SINCE MY FATHER DIED. I DON'T REALLY REMEMBER HIM MUCH, BUT... HE DIED RIGHT BEFORE IZZIE CAME. HOW DID YOU END UP LIVING BY YOURSELF? DIDN'T SOMEBODY COME LOOKING FOR YOU AFTER SHE DIED? WHAT ARE YOU DOING FOR MONEY? MY MOTHER FIXED IT FOR US. FIXED IT? WHAT DO YOU MEAN "FIXED IT"? SHE KNEW SHE WAS GOING TO DIE, AND SO SHE MADE SURE WE'D BE OKAY. HOW? SHE GOT US AN APARTMENT. WE ALL MOVED INTO IT, AND THAT'S WHERE WE WERE LIVING. I PAY THE REN ONLINE EVERY MONTH. AND AS LONG AS THE LANDLORD GOT HIS MONEY, HE DOESN'T BOTHER US. WELL, WHERE WERE YOU LIVING BEFORE THAT? WE HAD A HOUSE. MOM SOLD IT TO THE COMPANY. WHAT COMPANY? MY MOM CREATED A COMPANY, A CORPORATION. SHE SAID IT WOULD PROTECT US. SHE SOLD THE HOUSE TO THE COMPANY, AND MADE A CONTRAC WITH THE MANAGER, SO THAT WE COULD RENT IT OUT, AND THE MONEY FROM THA GOES INTO THE COMPANY BANK ACCOUNT. OKAY, BUT, GERTIE, THIS DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE. HOW COME THE STATE DIDN'T JUS PICK YOU GUYS UP AT THE HOSPITAL? SHE TOLD THE HOSPITAL WE WERE HER NIECES. THE NURSE WAS NICE AND LET ME COME IN, BUT... IZZIE HAD TO WAI IN THE WAITING ROOM. SHE TOLD ME THAT SHE WAS GOING TO BE GONE SOON. ( beeping ) ( crying ) THAT GOD... HAD SOMETHING FOR HER TO DO. AND THAT I WAS IN CHARGE NOW. I CRY FOR HER EVERY DAY. ( Tonya whispering indistinctly ) I'M SO SORRY, GERTIE. I-I... I JUST CAN' BELIEVE YOUR MOTHER WOULD SET IT UP FOR YOU TO LIVE ON YOUR OWN. SHE DIDN'T WANT US TO GET SPLIT UP AND MORE THAN LIKELY THEY WERE GOING TO. WHAT KIND OF MOTHER COULD DO THAT? DON'T TALK ABOU MY MOTHER LIKE THAT. YOU DON'T KNOW HER. GERTIE, I AM-- DO YOU KNOW WHAT IT WAS LIKE FOR HER TO SET US UP WHILE SHE WAS SICK? HUH? DO YOU KNOW WHA IT WAS LIKE FOR HER TO RAISE US WHEN SHE DIDN'T FEEL GOOD? DON'T TALK ABOUT HER, YOU DON'T KNOW. I'M SORRY, GERTIE. GERTIE, WE GOT BREAKFAST. NOW, SHE KNOWS. GERTIE! WHAT WAS THAT ALL ABOUT? BABE? ( sighs ) ( whirring ) Greg: WELL, WAIT A MINUTE. LET ME GET THIS STRAIGHT. SO, SHE'S BEEN RAISING IZZIE BY HERSELF FOR THE PAST YEAR? SHE SAID HER MOTHER SET IT UP. HUH. WOW. WOW? YEAH, I THINK THAT'S INTERESTING. UH... Greg: WHAT? IMPRESSIVE? IT'S DANGEROUS. AND IRRESPONSIBLE. YEAH, I GUESS SO. SO YOU THINK IT'S ALL RIGH FOR THEM TO BE ON THEIR OWN LIKE THAT? OH, NOW WAIT A MINUTE. I DIDN'T SAY THAT. LOOK, THAT'S ALL I'M SAYING IS THEY'VE BEEN DOING PRETTY GOOD ON THEIR OWN SO FAR. THAT DOESN'T MAKE IT RIGHT, GREG. KIDS NEED SOME KIND OF SUPERVISION. THEY NEED GUIDANCE AND NURTURING. IT'S A MOTHER'S JOB TO PROTECT HER CHILDREN. THEY DON'T HAVE THE JUDGMENT TO-- SO WHAT, DO YOU WANT TO ADOPT THEM? REALLY? NO. NOT REALLY. HEY, BABY. WHAT ARE WE TALKING ABOUT HERE? WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? WOULD IT REALLY BE SO BAD? ( sighs ) MAYBE. I'M TAKING THE GIRLS SHOPPING. SO THEY CAN... GET THEIR MIND OFF THINGS. ALL RIGHT. ( mutters ) I HAVEN'T HAD NEW CLOTHES IN A LONG TIME. IT HASN'T BEEN THAT LONG. LONG ENOUGH. OKAY, IZZIE. YOU LIKE YOURS? YEAH, THEY'RE ALL RIGHT. HEY, GIRLS. SOLID OR PRINT? SOLID. OKAY. I'LL TRY IT ON. YOUR TEACHER'S NICE. HMM. SHE'S OKAY. I LIKE MR. GREG, TOO. YOU ONLY LIKE HIM 'CAUSE HE GOT YOU BREAKFAST. SO? YOU'RE SO EASY. GERTIE, I GOT AN IDEA. NO. BUT YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT I WAS GOING TO SAY. ALL RIGHT. WHAT? WE COULD STAY WITH THEM. THEY'RE NICE. AND THEY HAVE LOTS OF-- NO. WHY NOT? BECAUSE WE CAN'T. WELL, WHERE ARE WE GOING TO GO? I'LL THINK OF SOMETHING. I JUST THOUGHT OF SOMETHING. HOW COME WE NEVER DO WHAT I THINK OF? IZZIE, THEY'RE JUST BEING NICE TO US BECAUSE WE'RE TEMPORARY. THEY DON'T WANT US TO STAY FOREVER. HOW DO YOU KNOW? I JUST KNOW. DID YOU ASK THEM? WELL? WELL, WHAT? DID YOU? NO! WELL, MAYBE THEY DIDN'T THINK OF IT. WE DON'T NEED 'EM, OKAY? ON MONDAY, WE'LL GET A NEW PLACE AND IT WILL BE JUS LIKE IT WAS BEFORE. WE'LL BE FINE. BUT THEY'RE-- IZZIE! STOP. ( sighs ) HEY. I'M SORRY. ALL WE CAN COUNT ON IS US. YOU TRUST ME, DON'T YOU? DON'T YOU? ( whispers ) Yes. GOOD. YOU GOTTA LISTEN TO ME, ALL RIGHT? I WON'T LET YOU DOWN. WE'RE A TEAM, WE GOTTA STICK TOGETHER, OKAY? OKAY. GOOD. COME ON, LET'S SHOP. Tonya: YOU KNOW, I'M... I'M SORRY FOR WHA I SAID ABOUT YOUR MOTHER. I DIDN'T MEAN TO INSULT HER. I JUST... I'M SORRY. I KNOW. I'M SORRY FOR WHAT I SAID, TOO. OKAY. HOLD THIS, PRETTY PLEASE. GERTIE, WATCH. I'M GOING TO CLIMB ALL THE WAY TO THE TOP. ( chuckles ) BE CAREFUL! OKAY! SHE LIKES YOU, YOU KNOW. OH, YEAH? I LIKE HER, TOO. WE'RE GOING TO LEAVE ON MONDAY. LEAVE? WHERE ARE YOU GOING, GERTIE? I'M NOT REALLY SURE ABOUT THAT PART. WE CAN FIND A MOTEL ROOM OR SOMETHING. THAT DOES NOT SOUND SAFE. I KNOW. THE BEST THING FOR YOU TO DO IS TO HELP US GET ANOTHER APARTMENT. Greg: CAN'T BELIEVE YOU'RE SERIOUSLY CONSIDERING THIS. OF COURSE NOT. I CAN'T DO THAT. GOOD. THEY DO NEED A PLACE TO STAY, THOUGH. MM-HMM. NO, TONYA. WHY? IT'S JUST FOR A LITTLE WHILE UNTIL WE FIGURE OU WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO. NO, WE ALREADY KNOW WHAT TO DO. WE CALL CHILD SERVICES AND THE STATE WILL COME AND PICK THEM UP. NO, GREG. AND WHY NOT? BECAUSE THEY MIGHT GET SEPARATED. THEN THEY MIGHT NO GET SEPARATED. YOU CAN'T BE THIS INSENSITIVE. I'M NOT INSENSITIVE. THEIR MOTHER JUST DIED. YEAH, ABOUT A YEAR AGO, AND THE STATE SHOULD HAVE PICKED THEM UP THEN. LISTEN, THEIR MOTHER DID ALL THE WRONG THINGS FOR THE RIGHT REASONS, OKAY? I'M NOT SAYING WHA SHE DID WAS RIGHT. THEN WHAT ARE YOU SAYING? I'M SAYING... CAN WE JUST THINK ABOUT IT? ( sighs ) OKAY. I THOUGHT ABOUT IT. REAL SIMPLE. COME MONDAY, WE CALL CHILD SERVICES, AND THEY'LL COME AND PICK THEM UP. ( casually striking piano keys ) HEY. CAN YOU PLAY? EH... MY MOTHER TAUGHT ME. SHE COULD PLAY. WE USED TO PLAY SOME SONGS TOGETHER. SO, WHAT'S GOING ON? YOU CAN'T SLEEP? I'M JUST GETTING MILK FOR IZZIE. HELPS HER SLEEP SOMETIMES. THAT'S GOOD. MR. FREEMAN? YOU KNOW WHAT, CALL ME GREG. OKAY? GREG. MM-HMM? I'M SORRY ABOUT ALL THIS. WE DON'T WANT TO BE ANY TROUBLE. NO WORRIES. WELL, THANK YOU. FOR EVERYTHING. LETTING US STAY HERE AND... YOU KNOW. IT'S OUR PLEASURE. YOU NEVER WANTED TO HAVE KIDS? DON'T YOU THINK YOU SHOULD, UH... GET THAT MILK UP TO YOUR SISTER? RIGHT. CAN I GET YOU SOME? NO, BUT THANK YOU. OKAY. OKAY. GOOD NIGHT. GOOD NIGHT. CAN WE GO TO THE PARK AFTER BREAKFAST? NO. CAN'T GO TO THE PARK EVERY DAY. OKAY? I FIGURE WE GO TO CHURCH THIS MORNING. Tonya: I'M NO GOING TODAY. WHAT WAS THAT? WE'RE NOT GOING EITHER. I'M GOING. NO. YOU'RE NOT. HEY, LOOK, STOP IT. EVERYBODY AT THIS TABLE IS GOING TO CHURCH. EXCEPT ME. WHAT DO YOU MEAN YOU'RE NOT GOING? JUST WHAT SAID. IT'S ALL JUS SUPERSTITION ANYWAYS. Greg: GERTIE. DON'T SAY THAT. IT IS, IZZIE. BELIEVING IN GOD IS LIKE BELIEVING IN SANTA CLAUS. NOT TRUE. Greg: IZZIE. YOU'RE RIGHT, OKAY? GOD DOES EXIST. HE'S JUST AS REAL AS YOU AND ME, YOU UNDERSTAND? ( scoffs ) ( sighs ) WHERE ARE YOU GOING? Greg: TONYA? YOU'RE FOOLING YOURSELF, YOU KNOW. Gertie: I KNOW THE TRUTH. THE TRUTH IS YOU DON'T KNOW NOTHING. BUT I'M NOT GOING TO SI HERE AND ARGUE WITH A 14-YEAR-OLD GIRL IN MY HOUSE. Greg: TONYA? WHAT? TONYA. LOOK, HEY! DO YOU HEAR ME TALKING TO YOU? WHAT? WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU? I THOUGHT WE WERE SUPPOSED TO BE ENCOURAGING THESE GIRLS. THERE'S NOTHING WRONG WITH ME. I JUST DON'T FEEL LIKE DEALING WITH GOD TODAY. OH, YOU DON'T FEEL LIKE DEALING WITH GOD TODAY? NO. NO. I GOT TOO MUCH ON MY MIND. AND THAT'S WHEN YOU NEED TO BE PRAYING MORE. I AM SO SICK OF PRAYING, GREGORY. I'M SO SICK OF GOD, TOO. WAIT A MINUTE. HOW ARE YOU GOING TO BE SICK OF GOD. I'M SICK OF GOD MAKING A FOOL OF ME. HE'S MAKING A FOOL OF YOU? GOD KNOWS I WANT CHILDREN. YOU KNOW I WANT CHILDREN. BUT HOW COME I CAN'T HAVE THEM. YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHA MIRACLES GOD HAS IN STORE. PLEASE DON'T PREACH TO ME. WE'RE NOT EVEN PRAYING FOR THE SAME THING, GREG. DO YOU EVEN WANT TO HAVE CHILDREN WITH ME? I ALREADY TOLD YOU. JUST ANSWER YES OR NO, GREG. DO YOU WANT TO HAVE CHILDREN? IS HE OUT THERE, HUH? STOP IT. IS HE? STOP IT. YOU'RE BEING A BABY. STOP IT. IS HE? STOP IT. STOP IT. HUH? Izzie: STOP IT. Gertie: SHOW ME! I ALREADY TOLD YOU. NO. NO. THIS IS YES OR NO. DO YOU WANT TO HAVE CHILDREN? Gertie: WHERE'S GOD? Izzie: LA LA LA LA. Greg: HEY! Gertie: HE'S NOT REAL! Greg: KEEP IT DOWN! Izzie: I KNOW HE IS! HOW? HUH? HOW DO YOU KNOW? BECAUSE MOM TOLD ME SO! MOM IS DEAD. Greg: HEY, GERTIE. Tonya: HEY. Tonya: IZZIE! Greg: IZZIE! Tonya: IZZIE, WAIT! WAIT! YOU KNOW, GERTIE, THAT WAS REALLY MEAN. IT'S TIME SHE LEARNED THE TRUTH. SHE NEEDS TO GROW UP. LOOK, I KNOW YOU'VE GOT A LOT OF HURT IN YOUR HEAR, LITTLE GIRL. BUT THAT DOES NO MAKE GOD A PHONY. ( tires screeching, screams ) IZZIE! ( "If I Have to Wait" by Toni Braxton plays ) WHAT DID YOU DO TO MY WIFE! BABY! TONYA? TONYA, TONYA, TONYA! SOMEBODY CALL 911! SOMEBODY CALL 911! ( Izzie crying ) WHAT HAPPENED? WHAT HAPPENED TO HER? ( Izzie mumbling through tears ) Greg: WHAT DID YOU DO? WHAT DID YOU DO? ( no audible dialogue ) TILL THE GHOSTS ALL DISAPPEAR ( Greg mumbling ) OKAY. THE GOOD NEWS IS SHE'S STABLE. SHE HAS A BROKEN LEG AND A FRACTURED RIB. NOW WE ARE CONCERNED ABOU SWELLING IN HER BRAIN. SHE'S IN A COMA. Greg: A COMA? WELL, HOW BAD IS IT? HEY, WELL, SHE'S GOING TO BE OKAY, RIGHT? THERE'S NO WAY WE CAN TELL. BUT WE'RE DOING ALL WE CAN. I WANT TO SEE HER RIGHT NOW. I WANT TO SEE MY BABY RIGHT NOW. OF COURSE. I'LL BE RIGHT BACK, OKAY? ( beeping ) ( sighs ) WOW. OH, BABY. LOOK AT YOU. LOOK AT YOU, BABY. ( sighs ) IT'S GOING TO BE OKAY.
