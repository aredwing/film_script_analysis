Russell, there is work for you ... My God. - How long job for him? - Five years. Five years I am a little nervous. I have to say you're a great boss ... and I admire and respect very much what did your agency. But this is not the best. His greatest achievement, if I may be bold ... and biased ... Judy is his daughter. I really love his daughter. Russell, you give me permission to ... to marry your daughter? No. Daddy! You heard me. I said "no" ... not yet. However, if the account can Airline tomorrow ... I will say yes. Man, you got me now. Understood. I'm kind of prize for the winner. I'm flattered, Dad, very flattered. Eddie, we feel the same. You are an important part this family ... and we will be honored to have him as our son in law. - Good morning. - Good morning. Wow, you're beautiful. I know I will win this account!

Goodbye. - Hi - Hello Guys, you saw Eddie somewhere? - No. - No, we did not see today. His daughter said he left with time to spare. It must have been trapped in traffic. - He tried his cell phone? - Not attending. Drugs. Where is he? Dammit. Sure, they're here. We will have to improvise until Eddie arrives. Edgar. Good morning. - It's good to see him. - It's good to see you too, Russell. - Hi, Anthony. - Good morning. Mr. Rasky. Gentlemen, I can not wait to hear the presentation of you. His competitors had great work. - I hope they can overcome them. - Believe me. We will. Our creative team has worked 24 hours every day. Great! Come on. Edgar, we have a little problem. Our creative director, Eddie Schneider, you know ... he's a little late, due to traffic. With all due respect, Russell. These strikes are ending with our airline. I am sure he will get at any second. How about going to the boardroom? Yes, why not? - Hi, it's good to see him. How are you? - Hello Hi How are you? Well You look great. Thank you. By far it's worth, sir ... maybe we should take our business elsewhere. Advertising Birk. How can I help? Eddie, are you drunk? I have to improvise here. I can not bring iced coffee. Birk will cut my head. The coffee must be cold. Very cold, right? Over my dead body. Mr. Birk ... Mr. Schneider called. He said he will be here ... as soon as possible, for him. Meanwhile, he suggests they take a coffee ... and relax. God. It's cold! The coffee is cold. - Norah, call me on my cell phone. - What? Call me now. Hello, everybody. Edgar has arrived? There he is. Hi, Edgar, how's life? What? It will speak with you. Excuse me a moment. - Hello? - Eddie? Hi, guy. How are you? And then? - He asked me to call you. - Squash at 17h? What? Eddie? Squash? Eddie, are you stoned? - Eddie? - Let's mark at 17:15 pm - I'm in a presentation. - What? Okay, agreed. See ya. Edgar, how you feel? What? Do not answer a question with another question. Just tell me. How do you feel? Enough! Let's go! Edgar, is not the way we work. Eddie, are you crazy? You're fired! "You're fired." This is the decree of a man business of truth, Russell. Thank you. Back to you, Edgar. Please tell me. How do you feel? I feel like an idiot. Wasting time ... with a bunch of amateurs putting my business at stake. Now you know how your customers feel when traveling with your airline. - You're ... - Edgar, please ... sit and listen to me one minute. I will make it worthwhile. I promise. Thank you. Now visualize that. I am a customer of Trans USA Airlines with the passage at hand. My passage indicates my flight will leave at 14h. I leave the company at 11 h. .. to get to the airport with time enough to check in. I'm at the airport but can not even see the check in counter ... it is crowded with passengers last minute, or waiting in line ... who are trying to get tickets at half the price I paid. And you know what? Your people are paying attention to them and not me. So I stand there in line waiting for a long time. Finally my turn comes and the clerk tells me ... "Lord, we are anticipating that there a delay of at least two hours ... Then, how about going to our area rest and relax? " I think: What? It's two hours more I'd be working ... and investing in my clients. Would have cost ten cents for the company to call me. But I'm not important, to bother? " So kindly ask her ... "Lady, why not warn me in advance? " She replies: "I'm not your personal assistant." I get mad and ask to speak to the supervisor. And it comes ... Mr. Calm. I tell him what happened and he says ... "Lord, only hire people very well trained. Can I buy you a cup of coffee at the airport bar. " I do not hear: "Sorry, let's quit this bitch now. " Instead I hear: "How about a coffee with the smell of urine ... that looks like it is burning in the jar since they built the airport. " Now I am in rest area with a cup of iced coffee in hand ... what I see? What I see? "Trans USA Airlines: Can I help you? " You know how I feel, Edgar? As a loser! And this is exactly how it feels right now ... and will not feel better until they make you feel better. That's why, from now on ... things in the USA Trans Airlines change. And I'm taking the first step, here, now! People do not go over this. They are full! I'm sick! We are all full. From now on ... Our motto is ... "Trans USA Airlines. His business now. " You guys rock. Can I take a fresh coffee? And that's hot this time. We work like crazy ... He could have told us. Yeah, you could at least have told me. I am copying your boss. I know, but just had the idea the way to work. - There was not enough time. - I understand. Eddie, you're crazy! I'm thirty years in this business and have never seen a show like this. Good job, son! But please, please ... next time, a short notice? Where were you? What were you doing? I can not tell you. Stop it. Stop it. I think we want to the usual, right? - Sushi Plates. - No, no, not today. Today we celebrate! A bottle of champagne and lobster, please. Our lobster! Well, I think it has every reason to celebrate after what he did. No, no, no about it. I have to tell you something. I asked her to marry. What? I asked. E? Guess what? My God, Eddie. That too! - Congratulations! - Thank you. I am very happy for you. But I also want to toast our relationship. It means a lot to me. And I'm so happy because I never ... you know. - Trans? - Is. Exactly. Well, you know, I have to admit ... for a short period I probably would not have said no. - Short? - Yes, short ... but I would just one among dozens. - This is not true. - It's true, yeah. Eddie! You will marry. You must take a conscious decision now! - You must stop betraying Judy. - I'll stop. - Right. When? - When? When I married, I'll stop. Why not now? Because it is not easy to resist, I told you this before, right? You stood me very well. This is different. You're my best friend. Listen, I know how much you love Judy ... but not worth the risk. Okay, I promise. I will not risk it. I want to swear. - In this menu Sushi? - Yes, this menu of Sushi. Right. - I swear, Your Honor. - And really good! Or what? Or I'll kick your ass. I did. Your baby. Eddie, won the account! They just call! We did it! Crazy bastard! Just won the account the largest airline in the country! Eddie, I love him. Attention, Please? I would like to make a toast the creative director. Viva! Wait, there's more news, more news. From now on ... we will be ... Birk & Schneider Advertising. As they say in the West ... "Welcome, partner." Partner, partner! Judy ... I will make a run, okay? What? Do not come again. This is new. No, Vicky ... is serious. I'm getting married. I'm married. No, seriously. Do not want to do this. This must stop. Listen, how's the campaign? Well, it's almost ready. It will be fantastic. Others. I have to tell you ... for a second ... I thought it was bluffing. How so? Please. It was delayed for submission. I do not know what you mean. Nothing. Forget it. So how are things with Judy? It marked the wedding date? Not yet. We have plans ... but nothing definite. Should be a great step ... marry. It's a big commitment. Till death do us part. Well, continue with the ideas. - Good evening, folks. - Good evening. The new car of Anthony. - It's cool. - Is. - Okay, good night. - Good evening. See you tomorrow. Drugs. Drugs. Anthony, you scared me. Sorry, It was not my intention. I forgot my keys. Never leave my away from me. See you tomorrow. He had anal sex with you? What? You heard me. Eddie had anal sex with you? What are you talking about? Speaking of you and Eddie. My sister's fiance. Both of you. You know what I mean. You know ... not nice, Angelina. We pay you well and you have sex with the future husband of my sister. - This is not right. - Eddie and I are just friends. Do not lie to me. I bet it does all the time. Sex with anyone. I know that is not no difference to you. Well .. Until tomorrow, Anthony. Drugs. No. Shut up. Shut up! I know what goes on here. Still not done, dear. We both ways. Wow! Wow! It was perfect. My God. Honey. What happened to you? That bastard! Son of a bitch! I swear I'll kill him. Sorry, Angelina. I'm so ashamed. He should be ashamed. - I'll smash it. - No, Eddie, wait. I think I'm bleeding. Take me to a doctor, please? How is she? She is showing strong symptoms post-traumatic stress. I gave her a sedative. She will be sleeping for a few more hours. Do you know who did this to her? She said that was one of the members. You told her family? No. I do not know them. It works for me. I mean, for the agency in which to work. Actually, no, Eve She's just a colleague. I'm just here to pay expenses. Only one colleague, is not it? Like us? Please Eve That was so long ago. In fact, is only four years. Of course, for someone with your appetite and speed ... must seem light years. Eve, I came seeking his help, not to speak of the past, okay? Listen, how about I call you when she wakes up? Can it be? Can. - I can see it? - Of course. Thank you. What? How well is not included? Are you saying that any bum can kick the door of my new car ... and your insurance company will not pay? Listen, they say they will not pay ... why not include vandalism in the policy. Now, why not include vandalism in the policy? Just a second! Sorry, but I asked him and you said it was too expensive. I did not say that. Hi, Eddie. I said a second. Now you will pay for it. I do not see how it will happen, Anthony. Want to bet, Frenchwoman? This will leave your next paycheck. No, forget it. We need to talk. What ... What is it? Need a raise? What kind of animal are you Anthony? What are you talking about? What is your problem? I'm talking about what he did Angelina last night. Really? What did I do with it? You raped her, dammit! - What? - Damn! It is you who is getting married. You know, you are brave to try me. What are you talking about? What am I talking about? That's what I'm talking about. You know, stay with them. I made these copies for you. I thought you might want. Do you dare to spy on me! Eddie, consider my position. Do not want to play full of the moral. I do not care if you cheat my sister. But I care with this company ... and I intend to lead this place until retirement. I need to know who I'm doing business, right? Now ... I never want to see him do a scene child because of a bitch. We will have to live with each other, you like it or not. You keep your mouth shut and I'm with mine. That's what being a family. Great. You know, it's amazing, man. You should be in Guinness Book world record. Hello? Hi How is she? She is a little better. She's talking with a detective now. Police? Who called the police? I, Eddie. I am obliged. Sure. Sure that she was raped? We examined. She scratched seriously ... and medically speaking ... there is no strong evidence. You will get it? No, I'm busy ... I mean, I'll call it later, okay? Okay, I'll tell her. Thank you for your help, Eve Thanks really. So I will have to pass why again? Yes, indeed. But I'll be constantly working with the assistant attorney ... that will open the process and we all we can to help her. What are the chances he was sentenced? The truth is that I believe in you, your story sounds plausible ... but the judge will want to some strong evidence ... as hematoma or sperm ... - And we do not have it, Angelina. - Sorry. It was the first thing I thought of doing. - It was with much disgust. - I understand. Maybe we should let it go. What about the person who brought it? - Eddie? - He can testify. Okay? Let's take her home. You need sleep. - Come back tomorrow e. .. - I do not want to go home. I do not want to be alone. Welcome. I'm Sister Meryl. What is your name, child? Angelina. What a beautiful name. Please make yourself at home. Sister, can I talk to her? - Of course, feel free. - Thank you. I want to be totally honest with you. This will be difficult, but we will. We can not let him get away with, for he will do again. Right. Thank you. Thank me when we have won in court. Hi, you've reached Eddie Schneider, I can not talk now ... please leave a message and return as soon as possible. Have a nice day. Eddie, I am. You can call me when you receive this post? Thank you. POLICE DEPARTMEN NEW YORK Eddie, the Detective Helen Drake is here to talk to you. Hello, Mr. Schneider. Detective Drake. I came to collect belongings Angelina Sable for possible evidence. Can you show me the workplace it? Of course. Come with me. Angelina told me about you. You did the right thing. Well, I thought I could help her leading her to a doctor. Eddie, his testimony will be important for the case of Angelina. Testimony? Yes I ask you to remember everything ... because every detail counts. EVIDENCE Is there a problem? Yes, I am the Drake Detective. And you are? My name is Russell Birk. I'm the owner of this agency and this is my son Anthony. It is a pleasure to meet you. I must inform you that this is part an investigation ... against his son by Anthony Birk Angelina Sable possible rape. What? You have a search warrant? No, but I can get a at a time ... and meanwhile I will take the belongings Angelina me. Okay, okay ... then ask nicely to leave the office. I'd love to. - Bert in between. - Russel. Thanks for coming. - Let me call Anthony, okay? - Okay. Bert ... - Thank you for coming on Sunday. - Do not say that, do not say that. To her family working 24 hours. You have proof, right? - Well, it's complicated, but we ... - Well, my son is innocent. - I want to prove it. - I understand. Whatever the cost, that jury must understand. Anthony is the victim here ... not that girl. This is exactly how I see. Great. As a result of the "attack" Angelina Sable spent two years ... in a psychiatric clinic. After he was released, She lived with her mother. Unable to live with his stepfather, He left home at age 17. What crazy. Forget about it for a minute. This could undermine her accusations against Anthony. Great. On the other hand ... Anthony was charged with molesting a girl at age 17. God! It was the same. Someone wanting to extort our money. Anthony, shut up. What? - Please continue. - The lawyer will know it ... they do their homework. No doubt. And as we will be? Present a defense so overwhelming ... and strong ... that even a jury by friends and family with Angelina ... find that Anthony is not guilty. Do it. I need help from Eddie. About you and Bert were talking about? About that thing Anthony. That thing? I mean rape? No, it was not rape. It was ... How do you know? I do not know, but I think ... innocent until proven otherwise, right? What they wanted from you? - They want me to testify. - Witness? What? You was not even there! They want me to testify on the type of employee that she was ... this kind of thing, you know. So Bert was there on Sunday? It is. I do not believe. Please there is nothing you can do. I think I'll run later. Has been running a lot lately. Eddie! Eddie. One second, please. Detective, I told you this before. I wish I could help but I can not. Eddie ... Russell Birk hired Bert Zikinsky. He is the worst bastard What's out there. He does anything to acquit their clients. I need your help. All I know is that I left the office ... and was not there when there is what has happened, happened. - What do you think happened? - What I think has to do with it? This is a police investigation, Eddie. Okay? We did some research about you. You do not get as much money to stay a partner agency of this pattern. So I think you're with hands in pockets Birk. That's funny? Let me tell you something! I owe nothing to anyone! All the major accounts that the agency has ... are mine! I won the! Not a month goes by without me receive proposals from competitors. So do not think you know or that I'm not in debt. Okay, so Eddie, Who will you choose? A friend or a rapist? What are you doing? I can not sleep. Eddie, are four and a half come to bed. Please sit down. The court is in session. The defendant, Anthony Birk, is accused of sexually violating Angelina Sable ... and causing, intentionally, several wounds in the body of Miss. Sable. An act so heinous and violent only a high penalty would be appropriate. - I was bleeding ... - The fact is that it never happened. This is ridiculous, there was no rape. Mr. Schneider, can you describe what happened the night in question? Our team worked late around 22h and we go all out. Ms.. Sable was part of that group? Yes We took the same elevator, others fell on the ground floor. And Angelina and I went to the garage, we took our cars and left. In his testimony, you said you drove yourself. Yes, I went out driving first, but her car was behind me. You were asked for three hours by police ... and never mentioned having seen ... Angelina Sable into the car ... and exit. I always said that we were together. Your Honor, permission to treat the witness as hostile. Granted. You have not seen Miss. From Sable. The fact is you're lying ... to protect his friend ... and keep your job. - Objection! - Accepted. Continue. You saw Miss. Sable the next morning ... and she was clearly upset and distressed. Yes. She was really in shock. But she was emotionally tormented ... then, you thought something bad must have happened to it? Protest. I agree. What she said What happened? Well, she told me Anthony had raped a Birk. And you responded by taking it immediately to the doctor? Yes, I took Dr. Sage a good friend of mine. Because he thought the situation required immediate medical attention. Yes, she was crying and asked me ... then I took her. That's it. That's all. No further questions. Opposition? Mr. Schneider ... is safe to say you and Miss. Sable are friends? Yes. The condition of Miss. Sable should have left him worried? Yes, he left. But you did not call the police. First I wanted to hear Anthony's side. But if he had believed, you would have called. You had questions. Why? Well, I know Anthony well ... and could not imagine doing it something with it. Any idea why or as Miss. Sable ... would make these false accusations? Well, that afternoon, we had lunch ... and I informed that the agency would dismiss it. Why? Russell and Anthony Birk ... both felt that her work was lacking. - And you have the same opinion? - Pardon? You also find she was incompetent. No. So why quit? You're not the boss the creative department? Yes, I am but Anthony and Russell ... had already made the decision, and there was nothing I could do. Thank you, Mr. Schneider. Miss. Mitchell? I would like to call Miss. Sable to speak of these new statements. Miss. Sable, do you remember any conversation with Mr. Schneider ... on any discontent Birk for his work on Advertising? No. Actually, I was always praised for my performance. Thank you. But I remember a conversation I had with him that day in the morning. We talked about their future wedding ... and the effect it would have if we were having. This conversation took place after we had sex. Silence in court. Mr. Zikinsky, there any comments? Miss. Sable, seems to have a very active sex life. - Objection! Your Honor! - Accepted. Mr. Zikinsky, please continue with your analysis ... and spare us feedback so common. Sorry, Your Honor, but this is unbelievable. Now Miss. Sable says it is having sex with Mr. Schneider? I see a very clear example here. It is not just someone doing what you want ... to accuse him to be having sex with you. - Protest. - Accepted. Please tell us Miss. Sable ... this is the first time accusing someone of sexual harassment? Your Honor, I would like to read this Police Report 12 May 98. Protest! I have a copy police report this! Rejected. It is a public record. Continue, please. "And four boys ran behind me, grabbed me ... held me down and raped me. Suddenly ... a black general appeared and killed the boys. " Remember to this statement? Yes. Do you care to explain to court? It is not surprising. No charges were filed ... there were no convictions. Not true, Miss. Sable? Because there was no evidence ... no general black mysterious was found ... and there was no condemnation whatsoever. Soon after, you spent two years intensive care ... in a psychiatric clinic and you take antipsychotic medications. You lied for nine years ... and is lying now. Not true, Miss. Sable? Anthony Birk never touched ... is just an act of desperation for revenge. - Objection, Your Honor! - Okay, okay ... Need not respond. I did not sleep with her, have to believe me. Eddie, I'm not stupid! Why did she invent something? You know what? I do not think I can believe you. Why? Because you're lying. I did not sleep with her. Why do not you understand? Do not yell at me, Eddie. I do not deserve it. Hello. Hi, it's Eddie. Hi! How are you? Not good! I can see it? Okay. Judy ... I will make a run, okay? What are you doing? I thought I'd run with you. You know, exercise, clear the mind. Since when do you run? For some time now. I'm full of surprises, Eddie. And you? Well, I run fast I hate to stop and wait ... Well, try to keep up. But do not decrease your pace. Okay? Judy! Judy, wait! I hurt my ankle. Drugs. Damn! My ankle. - Damn! - Please, Eddie. Stop it! - Stop what? - Stop lying! What do you mean? What do I mean? Look at you. You run four, five times a week ... you are totally out of shape! Come on, be a man and admit it. Admit what? What is sleeping with that woman down the street! Please she's my friend, you know? Eddie, the only race that has given is to go to her house and back. God! I am the only person in the neighborhood it seems not to know. I thought I would never do this to me ... but you did. I was wrong. It's all over. Judy! You should try to eat something, dear. Maybe later. Sorry by what is happening. I have prayed for you. Thank you. You can not lose faith. What? Must believe that we are all part a great plan. Sorry, sister ... but my part in this plan is a horror! I am raped twice and both times they get away. The justice will be done. You will make them burn in hell? They will pay for their crimes. I was not very comforting to know that animals who raped me ... pay for it in another life. I understand, dear. Try to rest. Do you know where to find me if you need me. Do not hurt yourself. You do not have guilt. They said they did not kill the men who raped me ... I imagined everything. What do you feel in your heart? I do not know what to believe. You were not there to protect myself from Anthony. I can not help these things happen ... but I know that everyone has to pay for their actions ... sooner or later. I want to believe you're real. I am ... and this time be with you. But you have to help me. How? They weaken. Are you okay, honey? I thought I heard voices. Yeah, I should be talking sleep. Okay. Good evening. Good evening. Eddie, Mr. Birk wants to see you in the boardroom. You I be fired? I have no choice, Eddie. You and Juddy will no longer be married, but she is entitled to 50% of the business. In these circumstances, I can not make him my partner. Russell ... Judy and I are going a crisis ... but I'm sure that come out of this. Eddie, I do not think so. In fact, Judy asked to warn you ... she is sending her things to a warehouse to pick up after you. Russell ... What happened between you and Judy is your problem. But this is my agency and they are my business ... and I want my family keep control. You must understand my position. Of course. I'm good enough to lie by Anthony in court and clear his bar. You can stop. Not my fault if you have your own definition of "jog". Let's not be emotional, Eddie. Bad things happen and we have to deal with them. This was a second agency when I came to work here. He brought all major accounts for you ... get all European campaigns. I agree. Contributed substantially to the success of this agency. In recognition of their efforts I am prepared to offer you ... compensation ... $ 200 thousand dollars. Two hundred thousand dollars for more than $ 20 million in business? Russell, this is an insult! I will look stupid? We do not have to do this. Take it or leave it. Crystal, dust, stone, mescal? What you want, girl? I need something to start the back of the head. That will leave it pretty crazy. One of these is an elephant think you can fly. - Wait. - Also need something ... start to the back of the head, but the outside. How so? I need a gun. Do not worry about it, honey. You're doing a wonderful job. Excuse me just a second. Please need to talk to you. - I'm busy, go away. - Please, Judy. Thank you, dear. I will return next week and bring all my friends ... to see that wonderful store you have. Thank you, Mrs. Davis. - Right. Goodbye. - Bye. - Take care. - Thank you. What do you want? Well, congratulations on your new store. You finally got it. What do you want? You know your father I fired? It was not my decision. He runs the show. I worked hard for it. It was your choice, Eddie. I never asked to do so. Have you worked there when we met. I only wanted you. I did not care partner would be my father ... or work in the correspondence. All choices are yours. I know. What I was not able to give you? Nothing. Nothing at all. How many women did you sleep? What? How many women did you sleep? Some ... - Angelina? - No. Please Eddie, do not lie. I'm not lying. It was invented because very angry with me. Why? Because I lied in court. I lied in court and gave a false statement because Anthony ... he found my ... and he blackmailed. Then he raped her. Probably, yes. I do not know more. How could she do this? Honey, I know I did silly ... Eddie, go away, please or do not know what I'm doing. Schneider, already got a job? What does your dad always says ... - Shut up, Anthony. - Come on, be cool. It's round again? Listen, man! I do not like to talk to me after all I did for you. It was you who failed to keep your penis in your pants. What does it matter? You got $ 200 000. It's a lot of money for a guy like you. Think of all the whores that power will have sex with that money. Wow, I think could be inside a woman for ... a week? At least. God, that annoying, that annoying. It's a shame. Never touch me. Right. You had talent, man. You had talent. And this is Angelina, creep. I'll finish him off. Can I do anything for you? Get out of here. Are you thinking what? Grab a beer for me. Bitch! What do you want? Sorry to bother you ... just wanted you to know I have a new job e. .. I thought we could talk. Eddie. Finished! But Judy. Miss you much. You're drunk! I know, but I'm sorry. It's ridiculous ... - But I ... - What happened to your hand? I fell down the stairs. Well, you can not drive. So can catch it in the morning. Judy, please. Give me just five minutes, okay? You can sleep on the couch, but has to leave early, okay? Okay. What's wrong with me? Hi Hello - And then? - And then? - Want to party? - Party? Of course I want. Come on. Okay. Where are we? We have so much fun. - Okay. - It's what we do. Why not drop your pants for me? You like to play domineering. That's right. - Do not like it. - But it works for me. Listen, open the handcuffs, that's not cool, okay? Come on. I can do whatever you want with you. Listen, I do not know what makes to meet ... but do not want that! E? Okay? Come on. Drugs. Will not break, Anthony. It's an Audi, they make cars much strong. Remember? We made the trade. What commercial? What is this? Damn! Open handcuffs, psycho bitch ... - Or I swear I'll call ... - Go, call your daddy? - Fuck you! Open the handcuffs! - Anthony, Anthony, hear! - I want to ask something. - What? You know how I felt when you raped me? Stop it, it was just sex. It seems he had never done ... Damn! What is your problem? What is with the gun? Care. Can you imagine how it is when someone forces his member inside of you? Okay, listen ... not nice what I did, okay? I should not have done it. You can open the cuffs please? Why did this to me? I just apologize. - I can not do anything else. - Say. Drugs. Something came over me and I lost my head. It's like when you're a kid and want something stupid ... and then you see What was wrong was wrong. But you're not a child. I always liked you. What? - I flirt. - Should I feel flattered? We are two people civilized, right? Let's find a way to solve it. I give him $ 10,000, okay? Ten thousand? Ten thousand. - Will you give me ten thousand? - I swear to God I'll give you ten thousand. Ten thousand of rape? God, God! It's a bargain! So, $ 50,000. Fuck you. It is not money disgusting. So what is it? Stupid bitch? Damn! I'll show you. Where are you going? This is not happening. What are you doing? What ... Fuck you! Get out of here. No! Drugs. What are you doing? No! Damn! I'll kill you. You will pay for it. I swear to God, I will pursue you like a dog. Today we are gathered here to honor your soul ... and to give rest to the body the beloved deceased, Anthony Birk. Although the life of Anthony was short ... We can find comfort knowing that during his stint ... your spirit has touched many of us. And we must seek comfort on the console ... that the Lord has a plan for everyone. And not for us to understand his mysterious ways. All stand up for a moment of silence ... to the late Anthony Birk. - Yes? - Good evening, sister. Sister, Detective Paula York Steve Dwight. We could talk Angelina Sable? - Sure, come. - Thank you. Why was the funeral? He was there to make the family Birk remember what the son did you? Anthony did not make me anything. I made a mistake to accuse him. I went there to visit. At a funeral? It's a funny way to do this. It was not the first time accused someone raped her. I was young, okay? I went to therapy because of it. Nobody paid, by my allegations, except me. Right. So where was the night of the murder? I was here. Can anyone confirm this story? Listen ... is the following: Miss. Sable ... perhaps now is the moment of truth. Why not tell us exactly what happened, okay? She was with me. We spent the night talking and pray together. What? She was here with me ... all night. Sister, can testify to that? Yes. You'd swear in a court, sister? - Steve ... - What? She is a nun. I could swear. Edgar, how about a cup of coffee before we start? - It's hot? - Yes Hot coffee. Great. Take good care of you. Bring your account to our agency and going beyond. Today things go a constant flux, it is ... Sorry to interrupt, Mr. Schneider, you're arrested. How? I do not see that in the middle of a presentation? Shall I read their rights? Do not complicate this further, okay? - You must be joking. - No, I'm not. Mr. Schneider, if you want to do so, I can handcuff him here. Not really. I will not fall for it this time. This guy always has something under arms. Excuse me, this is a terrible mistake ... I'll be back. No, wait, stop, please. Stop. Official, I am sure that there is a way of ... Officially, there are a bunch the bad actors, are not they? Please Tomas, the show is over, bring it back now. Come on. You are suspected of murder. I do not know what else to say. This is crazy. Confess and ready. Confess what? You killed the guy. I did not kill him. His alibi was sleeping when you left. His fingerprints are all over the body Anthony Birk ... you have a strong motive. This is crazy. If you do not confess, and the jury convict him, will take at least 20 years. It is a long time. What reason do I have? Please, was fired by the agency after having placed them on top ... and why? - Only to have skipped around a bit. - Open the game, Eddie. With a good lawyer will take between seven and nine years. With good behavior, will come from four or five years. Hi Thanks for coming. What do you want? I want to say I'm sorry for what I did to you ... if I could, I would go back in time. I know it was you. I do not want to kill him. I just ... wanted him to understand what he had done to me ... and things ran a little control. But you did the right thing, he was no good. But you must confess. I can not. You can not? You need to confess or pass the rest of my life in this prison ... and I am innocent. Eddie, if I go to jail hang myself in two weeks. No, no. Listen, you can claim that was to defend himself or something ... I have a good lawyer e. .. I know how the legal system works, okay? I've been there. I deserve a future. I deserve to feel normal again. I want to sleep all night, without waking up crying. God. I have a family one day ... have children ... love ... love myself. I deserve to live, Eddie. Yes, you deserve it. Goodbye. Then the lawyer court would an innocent ... be condemned? Why? Just because you can not find the killer. You will hear repeatedly attack the character of Mr. Schneider. Why? Why do not have any solid evidence. He will try to play with your emotions ... try to make it stop liking of Mr. Schneider. But, frankly ... no matter whether they like it or not ... but if the lawyer court will come with solid evidence. Hesitation ... is my point. Hesitation is all they need to acquit. I guarantee that at the end this trial ... in relation to Mr. Schneider ... will have more than a hesitation. You had an affair with Mr. Schneider. Well, we saw sometimes. How many times he cheated his ex-girlfriend with you? I do not know, it happened for a few months ... but Eddie wanted to finish. He hit him a lot. We tried to hold him but he seemed angry. You saw him leave that morning? No. He had gone when I woke up. Sure that he had already gone? Yes. So from what you know, it could have gone when you went to sleep ... and returned to the Privilege Club ... Anthony Birk out to wait, to kill him. From what you know, it could have gone to his house that night ... to use it as an alibi. Why did Judy do? Well, I wanted to try back with her. What time was out of Judy? At about 06:30 h. Why not wait to say goodbye morning? Why she asked me not to be there by morning. Respected the desire his ex-girlfriend ... and early in the morning you went home. You had no reason the victim to hold a grudge. After you found out the agency's a job with better pay ... and you're doing very well. There is no reason. - Mr. Henderson, interrogation? - Yes, of course, Your Honor. Mr. Schneider ... Angelina Sable knows? You testified at trial the rape of Miss. Sable ... helping the late Mr. Birk be cleared. I witnessed I did not know anything. His testimony was a crucial evidence ... where the deceased was acquitted ... yes or no? Objection, Your Honor. - This question has been answered. - Yes, continue. Mr. Schneider, a month after Anthony Birk fired him ... after five years devoted himself to put Birk and Partners as a leader ... and have testified on his behalf. You must have been very sad actually angry? Well, I was not happy about it, but Judy and I'd just tear us apart ... Mr. Birk and wanted the agency remained in the family ... and asked me to leave. And I was immediately hired as creative director. And in court, I just told the truth ... said nothing to help someone. This is absurd. It was what I read. Do you understand what is under oath, Mr. Schneider? Yes. Mr. Schneider ... Mr. Anthony Birk ever blackmailed him? No. Thank you, Mr. Schneider. Thank you for being so clear about never having been blackmailed ... Anthony Birk. So I guess that rules out why. Or not? Or we can ... These pictures show Mr. Schneider having several sexual encounters ... with several women. - Quiet, please. - Protest. This is acceptable, Your Honor? I was not aware this evidence. Your Honor, it qualifies as a reason. Mr. Schneider has a copy these same photos ... and it is up to the accused inform your lawyer. I give permission. These photographs were taken by Lance Bokovic ... a private investigator hired by Anthony Birk. Mr. Birk blackmailed Mr. Schneider to lie in the trial of rape ... dismissed as having Miss. Sable. This photo shows Miss. Sable Mr. Schneider and ... the day he said have her fired. It seems that we can not rely on your truth, we can, Mr. Schneider? Anthony Birk blackmailed him to lie for him in court. Consequently, Mr. Birk was not arrested for raping an employee ... And the Lord said sleeping around. But Miss. Birk found out about their active sex life alone ... and ended the relationship. You lost your job at of Birk felt betrayed ... and his need for revenge led him to kill Anthony Birk. You tried to cover up. He look like a sex crime. You are a man addicted to sex, Mr. Schneider ... and like any addict, can not control. His addiction first led him to lie ... and then to kill. Is not it, Mr. Schneider? - Why not step right over it? - Linda, please! People like her not deserve to live. Mother, stop! You brought that ordinary into our family. Stop the car! Do not send me to stop ... He said to stop the damn car. Do not send me to stop ... Shut up ignorant slut! - Do not send me to shut up! - Shut up! Shut up! Shut up or I'll do it for you. - Judy, come back! - Let her go! What went through your head, man? You stood in a situation of no return. What are you talking about? I am innocent! Why did not you say? I did not want them to use it against me, okay? That's exactly what they will do now! But I am innocent. Eddie, I believe in his innocence. But, friend ... you're the only suspect. Okay, I know who did it. Who? - Angelina Sable. - How do you know? She told me. Damn, why did not you say? You will have to testify against her in court. No, no. - No, I will not. - Why? If I testify it will go to jail she will hang herself. Eddie, your gesture is very noble ... but you really want to go to jail for something it did not? They can not arrest me without proof. Of course they can, man! Wake up! Innocent people go to jail every day. Eddie, do you believe in statistics? I do not know. 13% of all imprisoned for more fifteen years, committed suicide. So that leaves you with 87% chance out of prison alive ... the fifties. It does not seem too bad, right? Listen to this ... according to official statistics of the state penitentiary ... 21% die from problems health ... 31% never recover of psychological trauma. 35% die in discussions in prison. So adding it all ... I show my stats your chance of survival is 0%. In other words ... you are 100% screwed, man. Eddie, Angelina will not catch more than seven years ... and it will only serve four or five years. Anthony Birk raped. This will be taken into account. All we need tomorrow ... is that you go up there and tell the court What Angelina told him. Without this testimony, face, your life is gone. Mr. Schneider, please tell the court about his conversation with Angelina Sable. On March 17, Angelina came to visit me in prison. And she told him during the visit? She told me that ... She told him that, Eddie? She ... she told me ... Eddie, please tell the court What Angelina told Sable. It was a very important conversation. Eddie, please tell the jury. She told me she was very ... and wished me good luck at trial. Eddie! Please repeat what I said yesterday. That's it. She said nothing Furthermore. This is information even very important, Mr. Swell. Anything else? No further questions, Your Honor. Mr. Swell? I would like to speak with you. The defense has another request? Yes, Your Honor. I would call Judy Birk for questioning. Your Honor, the defense had its chance. New evidence appeared, Your Honor. We are not aware of it. How much tolerance will be here? Mr. Swell, why would I allow it? After the disrespect that you and his client had with the court yesterday ... I do not think that is a good time ask for another favor. Excuse me, sir, but I assure you that is important. How important? Enough for a man not spending 25 years in prison, I believe. - Miss. Birk, can stand. - Thank you, Your Honor. Miss. Birk ... I know you have important information I would like to share with the court. Yes. Sorry, but when I witnessed, I did not tell the whole truth. When Eddie slept in my house he stayed there all night. I took his keys and took them to the room at about 06:15 h. I could not sleep properly that night ... and I have heard if he had gone. I do not know who killed Anthony, but I know it was not Eddie. I swear it was there all night. Why yesterday you lied? You do not understand the pressure ... Can you speak up, Miss. Birk? You do not understand the pressure in my family ... to remain united. It was us against them. Whenever someone accused Anthony have done something ... they told me it was because someone wanted our money ... and it was our duty to support each other, no matter what happened ... we all knew Anthony. What do you mean, Miss. Birk? I am here to tell the truth about my brother. Anthony was a cruel man ... who raped several women! And my family was at his side, turning a blind eye ... and cleaning up after him, when necessary. Miss. Birk, how can you declare something like this? Because I am one of them. Anthony raped me ... two days after my birthday 15 years ... and raped other women. My brother was ... a cruel man ... and took advantage of all with whom he had contact. He was looking for some dirt the people around you ... and used it to blackmail them. He had many enemies ... but always safava ... because he was the son of my father. I know this must be being very difficult for you. Thank you for your courage to testify. A surprising twist in the case of murder ... involving advertising, Eddie Schneider. After the painful testimony his ex-girlfriend, Judy Birk ... sister also the murder victim. This court was shocked with the testimony of Miss. Birk. We will have to wait and see what happens in this case. Do we know who killed Anthony at the end? Can I ask you a question? Thank you very much to witness again. You saved my life. It was because he loved it. What you did there was so angry ... I would like to be. You are on the road. To the airport, please. Are you all right, Miss? I'm fine. I'm fine. Great. I'm lbrahim. I'm captain of this flight. It is a pleasure to have her on board. It's cold. Take care. You too.
