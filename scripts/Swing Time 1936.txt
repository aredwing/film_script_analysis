Yes, he said straight magic is too old-fashioned. Wait a minute, take a bow. No, you take it. I got to get married. Come here, they're applauding you. They like it. Lucky. Now what? - I want to reason with you, if I can. - But you already did. Have you really made up your mind to leave me... just to marry some girl you happen to know? It's kind of customary to know the bride, isn't it? I hate to see you leave show business. A man with your talents... My talent is gambling, Pop. Hoofing is all right, but there's no future in it. I want to spread out. I think I'm going to miss you, Lucky. I know I'm going to miss you, Pop. Is he staying with us, Pop? No, he's made up his mind to get married. How do you like that? Letting his marriage interfere with our career? We shouldn't have played his hometown. It was a bad move. Bad for us and bad for him. Local boy makes bad. - Father, has he come yet? - No, and it's all very much as I expected. Hi, fellows. - How do I look? - Marvelous, colossal, splendid. Wait a minute. You're not going like that. Of course. Big church wedding, girl's family very social... whole town there. I guess it doesn't really matter, just a hick town. What doesn't matter? - Last year's trousers. - Last year's trousers? No cuffs. - No cuffs? - No cuffs. Whoever heard of cuffs on these? Are you serious? Don't be ridiculous. - Maybe he's wrong. - Wait a minute. Let's see that. - What do you think of that? - You know, you're in a hurry and... Garnett, you're wanted on the telephone. Just a minute. I'll answer it for you. It will only take about five minutes. Let us have your pants. - Hello. - Hello, John. Will you hurry? Tell him the minister is here. Margaret's been ready for an hour. We're all waiting for him. All right, I'll tell him. - Who was it? - It was the minister. He said to take it easy. He'll be about a half-hour late. - Good. - You see, there's plenty of material. - I'll take them down and have them fixed. - No, you don't. Pop, take them to Schmidt's and have them back in five minutes. - You want two cuffs on them? - Yeah, one on each leg. And hurry up. Tell him I got to have them back right away. While we're waiting, we'll indulge in the famous indoor sport. I'll get seven. - The next man. - That's it. - Any word? - They say he'll be here any minute. You know, I told Margaret this would happen. I always say, marry in haste, repent at leisure. The young man is now one hour and 25 minutes late. That isn't exactly marrying in haste. As long as I am living, and longer... I have never seen cuffs on pants like these. What's the matter, can't you make them? I can make anything... but I would rather not be wrong than right. I'm paying for cuffs and I want cuffs. No. 10 times... 20 times, no. Can't you understand? Look, here, let me show you. Do you see any cuffs there? Not one cuff. Thousands of no cuffs. Here, look these over. You see? No cuffs. Millions of no cuffs. No cuffs. More than that, positively not one cuff. Why not? - I want to speak to Mr. Garnett. - Speaking. - Here he is, sir. - Let me talk to him. Say, listen, you, the guests are all going home and... I'm the happiest man in the world because the wedding is off. And furthermore, if you ever come to this house again... I'll break every bone in your body. Do you understand that? - Red, is that call for me? - No, it's my dame. Okay, sweetheart, and a great big juicy kiss for you. Wait a minute. Give me a chance to get my dough back. - Give us a roll. - Here it comes... You ought to marry those dice. Marry? Holy cats! What time is it? - Pop, my pants! - You've got them on. Oh, yeah. Wait a minute! You're not going with all our dough. I got to get married. I'll bet you the bankroll you don't get married. That's a bet. No cuffs. The tailor says those kind of pants shouldn't have cuffs. What? Nice fellows! Hello. Where's everybody? Why, the guests have all gone, sir. Did you wish to be announced? Just let me get my hands on that young man and I'll strangle him! You leave him to me. I'll take care of him. No, maybe I'd better surprise them. He can't do a thing like this to a daughter of mine. This is my affair, you keep out of it. I'm your father and I'll settle this as I see fit. We'll be the laughingstock of this whole town! So... Here I am. Young man, why didn't you appear for your wedding? I thought you'd ask me that. Don't stand there like a statue. You said you were gonna do something. Well, do it. What are you gonna do? Don't you dare touch him. - Why don't you do something? - I will. I will, but... Pardon me, I think I'm in the way. - Perhaps you two would like to be alone. - You stay right where you are. - I'm not finished with you yet. - I had a feeling you weren't. I wouldn't let you marry her for $10,000. - How about twenty? - Not for $20,000. - Twenty-five. - Not for... Say, young man, where could you get $25,000? By dancing? And there's another thing... coming back to your own hometown in a dancing act. I'm going into a new business. Only this afternoon I made $200. $200? Yes, that's why I was late for the wedding. That makes it a little different. I'm not consenting to your wedding... but I always admire any young man that can make money. It shows character. - That's too kind of you, sir. - Not at all. Then Margaret and I can get married? If you go to New York and work hard at your business... and if you are successful... you can come back here and ask me for my Margaret. Oh, Daddy. And in all probability I'll be very happy to give her to you. Right, sir. Thank you, sir. John, dear. You'll come back soon, won't you? That all depends upon the stakes, the stocks... Goodbye, my son. Thank you, father-in-law. I'll say goodbye again because we'll both be waiting for you. Hurry back, dear. I feel that I'm a little to blame in this. You know, I didn't realize what a bright, upstanding young man you were. And I don't care how big the city, I feel confident... you're going to be successful. Thank you, sir. Lucky, couldn't I go with you? I'm afraid you'd try to be a good influence on me. No, honest I wouldn't. I'm terrible bad when you get to know me. Then I wouldn't want you to come with me. One to New York, please. - Whose money are you using? - Yours, thank you very much. But our money belongs to us again. What's the idea? Remember our bet? You see, you didn't get married. - I'll pay you later. - No. All aboard! - But I've got to get that train. - You mean you had to get it. You know, you didn't win that lucky quarter. I'll flip you for a ticket to New York. I don't want to go to New York. He doesn't want to go to New York. Goodbye, Lucky, old boy. So long. - Goodbye, Lucky. - See you later. Give my regards to the folks, will you? Say hello to Aunt Lucy. So long. Goodbye, Lucky. Lucky, here's your suitcase. Here's your toothbrush. Boy, I'd give my life for a smoke. - Well, take the quarter. - No, sir, not the lucky one. Wait a minute. I'll get a smoke. I beg your pardon, have you got a match, please? Thank you. How careless of me. I left my cigarettes at home. Then you won't need the matches. I'm afraid that won't work, unless you have a needle and thread. Excuse me, have you change for a quarter? Thank you very much. You shouldn't have done that just for me. I could've gotten along without them. - You hold it. - All right. Looks like a jackpot. Go and get your lucky quarter back, quick. I beg your pardon. You probably think I'm silly. Yes, I'm afraid I do. Just a moment. That quarter, I wonder if I could have it back? This isn't getting you anywhere. You don't understand. I'm not trying to get acquainted. All I want to know is... It's all my fault, too. I'm awfully sorry. Yes, I know. You've been trying so hard to avoid me. All right, give it back. - Give what back? - The quarter you stole from my purse. Come on, will you? Hand it over or I'll call a policeman. I haven't got it. I gave it to you at the cigarette machine. - Officer. - Come on. Let's go, will you? No, wait a minute. What seems to be the trouble? Good morning, sir. Officer, this man stole a quarter from my purse. Make him give it back. Now, miss, does he look like a man who would steal quarters? - That's just what I said to the lady. - Imagine... I don't care what you think he looks like. I know he stole my quarter. Now you run along, sister... before I run you in for disturbing the peace. But, Officer, he took my... That'll be enough. Run along now, you're obstructing traffic. Why, you Cossack. Officer, you had no right to speak to that little girl that way. I suppose you're going to tell me what my duty is. Not at all, but... Listen, guys like you pay me to protect them from screwy dames. That's fine, but in this instance I'm sure you were wrong. So now I'm wrong. You ought to thank me for what I've done. - All right, thank you. - All right. What did you say? I said, look out for the great big ditch. Pop, why didn't you tell me you had it? In front of the cop? I would've been accused of stealing it. Give me that. Wait for me. Miss Carrol! Hello, kids. No wonder this school is losing money. Everybody late every morning. Any more dilly-dallying and some of you will lose your jobs. Yes, and that goes for you girls, too. Anybody would think I had nothing else to do, but nothing. One would. Miss Anderson, good morning. If you're late again, you'll be fired, too. That's final. I have nothing more to say. That's good. - Is that you, Mabel? - I don't know. Tell me, is it? - Kind of sounds like you. - That's a load off my mind. I'm never sure these days. - Did you see a young... - Visitors make the pupils self-conscious. Would you mind waiting a second, please? Thank you very much. Miss Anderson, come quickly. Please. He's hissing at me again, the swan. And good morning to you, too. - Are you interested in the dance? - I came here to see if I... All the world loves a dancer. To know how to dance... Is to know how to control oneself. Thanks. You saved me a lot of breath. Our course is $45. But the first lesson is given free... to see if the prospective student has any real aptitude. That's why our school is so successful. We never refuse the $45. - I mean... - You never let a pupil get away. I understand. We don't fool anybody. Have you any preference as to the type of instructress you'd like? Yes, I have. I'd like one that comes to about here. And if she had red hair, that would be a great help. And a cute little nose. She might be able to teach you to move your feet. Miss Anderson, my dear. Good morning. Me, too. - Mr. Gordon, this is Mr... - Garnett. How do you do, Mr. Garnett? I'm delighted, I assure you. - The young man would like a trial lesson. - Of course. I think Miss Carrol might please him. Of course, Miss Carrol. Come this way, will you? She's one of our best instructresses. You're a very fortunate young man to learn to dance... - to move... - To flirt with Terpsichore. Yes. What? How do you do? Do you mind if I wait here? - No, help yourself. - Thanks. I mean to the chair. Miss Carrol, this is Mr. Garnett. This is Miss Penelope Carrol. We're all so fond of her here, we just call her Penny. Penny, dear. - This is Mr. Garnett. - Penny. Miss Carrol. Mr. Garnett is very anxious to learn how to dance. So you won't always be stepping on other people's toes. - That's very good, isn't it? - Yes, that's very good. What kind of dancing would you like to learn? What kind have you got? - Sap. - Sap dancing? - No, she means tap dancing. - Tap dancing, of course. You see, we have tap dancing... and ballroom dancing and aesthetic dancing. If it's all the same to you, I'll take a little of each. A little of each, yes. Miss Carrol wants to know what kind you'd like to learn first? Whichever takes the longest. Go on, begin the lesson. You must learn to walk first. Now start with your right foot, please. - No, your right foot. - Sorry, I'm left-handed. Right, left. Miss Carrol, I'm sorry about your quarter. But you see, Penny... If you're trying to annoy me, you're succeeding. I know you don't care about dancing. But I do. All the world loves a dancer. Don't you? Right, left. - This is fun. - Now you turn. Start again. Right, left. If you don't get out of here, I'm going to lose my temper. If you talk like that, I'll call a policeman. - Why, you... - Officer... "Our young ladies are sweet-tempered, patient and understanding. " You're doing splendidly. I don't think you need me here any longer. I know I'm leaving you in good hands. Lovely hands. You know, that's the most marvelous trick I've ever seen a magician do. You mean the one with the four aces? No, the way you made my club sandwich disappear. Who, me? My dear young lady... You'd better take a club sandwich out of this hat. Are you accusing me of eating your sandwich? You might begin by taking that piece of lettuce off your necktie. One, two, three. Turn. Let's try it again from the beginning. One, two, three. Turn. - I'm getting it, aren't I? - Yes. Again. One, two, three. Turn. Now you've got it. I can't teach you anything. All right, I'll show you again. Remember, three steps to the left... three steps to the right and turn. One, two, three. Listen, no one could teach you to dance in a million years. - Take my advice and save your money. - Miss Carrol. How do you think this school can exist if you turn away applicants? - You're discharged. - But, Mr... Get your things and go. - But I... - Get out. That's quite all right, don't you worry. I'll find you another instructress. You stay right there. So this is the way you treat your customers? I certainly don't treat them to sandwiches. Get out of here. Miss Anderson, what is the meaning of this? What's gotten into everybody this morning? My sandwich got into him. You're fired. Okay, swivel puss. It might interest you to know that I've also discharged Miss Carrol. You've discharged Penny? Why? Why, for no reason at all. Please see her. But she said she couldn't teach you anything. She was trying to flatter me. She's the most wonderful little teacher I've ever heard of. Miss Carrol, I want to show Mr. Gordon how much you just taught me. No, never mind. Thank you. That's very sweet of you. I'm anxious for Mr. Gordon to see this. It's an interesting experiment. How did you say that last step went? Shall we try it right through? Won't you sit down, Mr. Gordon? Wait! Sheer heaven, my dears, sheer heaven! - Is she still fired? - Fired? You took me too seriously, both of you. Just you wait there for one moment. Hey, he got her job back for her. Wasn't that swell? What one man can do, another man can. All right, Al. Thank you. Now listen, I've just made an appointment for you for a tryout... with Mr. Simpson, the owner of the Silver Sandal. The Silver Sandal! That's wonderful, isn't it? It certainly is. Penny, you wear your white lam gown. That's how I see you. You in white, and Mr. Garnett here in dinner clothes. - Dinner clothes? - Yes, certainly. You'll do it? You'll be there? Now do you think I could disappoint you? I'll be there. You are still fired! Pop, you can pay the cab. - Have you got change for $10? - I have. Thanks. Here you are, buddy. You keep that. Now I don't want you to worry about losing your job. I'll take care of you. Yes, but I'll take care of my own $10. Wouldn't you like to double it? Sure, I love to gamble if I'm sure I'm going to win. - The trouble is, you lose sometimes. - No. We always win. Why didn't you say that in the first place? That's fine then. I'll telephone you when I'm ready. - All right. - Where do you live? - Right here. - Since when? Since from now on. How am I going to get a dinner jacket for tonight? Don't worry about that. Look, I borrowed this from Mabel. You're marvelous. - How do you do? - How do you do? I want to get suite for myself and Mr. Cardetti, please. - Something at about... - Just about... Yes, that's about enough. Doctor, would you mind rushing down to the docks... to see if our trunks have passed through the customs yet? Just a moment. You may need my verification. - What size chest? - Chest? You mean that little chest. The one in the hold? Yeah. - That chest is 36 inches. - 36. How long do you intend to stay with us? That'll be entirely up to you. Did you get a dinner jacket? No, I went broke trying to win enough to buy you one. - What am I going to do? - Now don't worry. I got you the swellest looking outfit you ever saw in your life. Where is it? It looks like a perfect 36. I want you to meet my old friend, Eric... What's your name again? My name is Eric Lacanistram. I met Eric in the gambling house. He lost all his money, too. I lost all my money, too. - Eric just loves to gamble. - Really? It's in the Lacanistrams' blood. Yeah, he'll play you for his necktie or his shirt or anything he's got on. Well, I'll toss you for the whole outfit. No, I'm off pitch and toss. The Lacanistrams' game is piquet. Has been for years and years and years... before the conquest and then after the conquest... for years and years and years. In fact, we've been playing piquet for years... and years... - But I don't know piquet. - Don't worry, I do. Yes, Al. All right, goodbye. If we're not at the Silver Sandal in 10 minutes, the tryout's off. But 20 minutes ago, Lucky said he'd be here in five minutes. He's said that for the past hour. I'm gonna go get him. I wish you would. I feel like a fool. But you are. Twenty-four, twenty-five, twenty-six and twenty-seven. And that's piquet, Mr. Garnett. Pop, you certainly did show me how to play piquet. You're doing fine. Fine? This fellow will have my skin in a minute. Come in. Penny! Listen, Penny. Look, Penny. Listen, let me explain. The clothes that I had before... When you're talking to a lady, you should take your hat off. Your petticoat's showing. Keep up the good work, boys. The public is with you. Mabel, will you get down from there and stop being ridiculous? Maybe you're the one that's being ridiculous. For a whole week you've been sulking at him for something that wasn't his fault. I suppose it was my fault. It's your fault that you're missing the tryout that Lucky arranged tonight. He's only doing it for you. You're not so smart, letting your stubbornness... interfere with the very thing you want. I like being stubborn where he's concerned. It must be love. How could I fall in love with a common gambler? When a man takes a little quarter... and builds it into a bankroll that would choke a horse... and makes my little $10 grow into hundreds... I'd call him an uncommon gambler. Come in, comrade. You, outside. My card. You're a big success. She's willing to arbitrate. I told you it would work. Mabel, will you tell that fellow to get out of the hall and stop annoying me? No, you sit down. You just hold your ground. Yes? Hello. - Penny. - You'd better get out of here. All right, I will. However, before I go, I want to tell you that maybe I was wrong the other night. But I didn't know it at the time. - So now you know. - Yes, I do. Goodbye. Wait a minute. Maybe, in a way, I might have been wrong. No, this one is on me. Listen, Lucky Garnett, there's no use arguing. - I'm not. - Yes, you are. All right, goodbye. Lucky, wait a minute. This concludes the Ricardo Romero Romantic Melody Hour. You know, I don't like that fellow. - He's very nice. - That? You have no reason to dislike him. You don't even know him. It's true, but when I dislike someone for no reason... I always find it more enjoyable. As a matter of fact, he's asked me to marry him several times. Of course you laughed. Or does he make you lose your sense of humor? - Ricardo. - Hello. I want you to meet Mr. Garnett. He's going to dance with me tonight. How do you do? I played that last number especially for you. Thank you. Now I know him and I still don't like him. Beautiful, isn't it? - What is? - The music. What music? - The music they're playing. - Yes. What made you think of it? - Think of what? - The music. I don't know. My mind was wandering, I guess. You as scared as I am? Don't be nervous. It's only a dance. It's nothing to worry about. That's right. Don't worry at all, my dear... because you're not going to dance. Because there isn't going to be any music. But, Ricky, you promised. I promised you could dance anytime you want, alone. I'll dance with Lucky or not at all. That's what I said, too, not at all. Good night. Come on, we'll see about that. - Mr. Simpson? - Hello, Garnett. Will you please tell Romero that he has to play for our dance? I'm sorry, but I can't. Romero's played his last tune for me. - But you said that... - I know I did. But I lost his contract last night playing cards. He's now the property of Dice Raymond. Orchestras usually play for somebody. This is the first I've heard of anybody playing for an orchestra. - I guess there's nothing we can do. - Wait a minute. Do you think we could interest Raymond in another game for that contract? I doubt it. He's always wanted Romero's band for his club... but he's a gambler. Where is this Raymond's place? Thirty-sixth floor, Club Raymond. Thirty-six. - Hello, Raymond. - Hello, Ricardo. Looks like a big night. Because where Ricardo Romero goes, the others come. Here goes everything on the red. Will you excuse me for a second? I think I need a bit of fresh air. - I can't stand the strain. - Wait a second. Twenty-seven, red, and third dozen. This is no strain. Please, don't be angry. I want to talk to you. I don't want to talk to you. I'm awfully sorry if I hurt you... but I didn't want to see anyone else dance with you. It makes me jealous. Jealous? Because... I love you. You have a very funny way of showing it. On the red. I want you to look at this new fellow. He's taking me, and fast. Say, if that hits for you, you'll have just exactly enough. Enough for what? Why, enough to go back and marry Margaret. What? Wait a minute. No bet. Seven. The red wins, and the first dozen. Pop, you're a pal. In fact, you're more than a pal... you're a partner. I'm going to cash in. So you won enough, you're going to leave us. Yes, winning more money doesn't interest me. Boy, you like to gamble. I'll cut you once, double or nothing. - No, thanks. - Scared? You have a contract with Romero, haven't you? I'll tell you what I will do. All my winnings against his contract. No, I win the orchestra... I keep the orchestra. Scared? You're on. I'll high-card you. Tony, bring a fresh deck. Keeps them on the ice. You're covered. Shuffle. - Cut. - After you. King of spades. Wait a minute. Let me, will you? Sure, let the old boy cut. Ace of spades. Excuse me, boys, I got to go and get a double sundae. Maybe we play for this orchestra again someday. Thank you, Mr. Raymond. Pop, cash in for me, will you? Okay, give us dough for these, will you? Maybe we can have that dance after all. - How? - Look, I just won Romero's contract. - That's a nice orchestra you have there. - Just about the best. - The leader's the same as the orchestra. - It's awfully nice of you to say that. I wonder if you'd be kind enough to play something for us... - if you don't mind. - But I do. I'm afraid you'll have to because, you see, I now own you. What do you mean, you own me? He just won you at the gambling tables. I see. Congratulations on winning such a valuable piece of property. Thank you. Now will you play your waltz for us? No. If you read the contract carefully... you will see I don't have to play after this hour unless I want to. So you won't play? You're right. I won't play for you. I see. That's all, boys. Ladies and gentlemen, my favorite maestro, Ricardo Romero... has very kindly requested that Ms. Carrol and I dance to his newest composition... the lovely Waltz in Swing Time. - Wait a minute. I didn't say... - Look, he wants to be coaxed. What's the matter, Ricky, old boy, you bashful? My pal. This is the moment I've been waiting for. - Wait a minute. Where are you going? - I'm going to get Pop. I'll get him. I mean, I'll do it for you. Sit still. What's the matter with Lucky? He seems to have something on his mind. You mean something else besides you? I don't know. I only get to see him at the rehearsals or with you and Pop... or when somebody else is around. Don't worry, darling. I'm going to see that you get a break this afternoon. Say, whose idea was this, anyway? Going to the country on a day like this. It was Mabel's, but she's made it mine. Listen, you got to do me a favor. No matter where we go or what we do, don't leave me alone with Penny. What's the matter, ain't you in love with her? You wouldn't pin me down with a question like that, would you? I see. Why, that's fine. Why don't you tell her? She's too sweet a kid, and besides that... I can't go on like this without her knowing something about Margaret... and I haven't got the nerve to come out and tell her, that's all. You don't have to go back to Margaret unless you get $25,000. Yeah, I know. So you haven't got it. So you don't have to go back. Yes, but it's more than money. I'm in a fine spot. - I'm going to take care of this. - Pop, no. - You better lay off gambling for a while. - But I don't want to lay off. - Hello, Lucky. - Hello, Mr. Simpson. I was looking for you. Have you seen the improvements? The decorators are working day and night, and when we're through... the Silver Sandal should be the finest place in town. And with you and Penny dancing to Romero's music... we're going to clean up. Yes, but I'm not sure I can stick around. Yes, you can. But you must. Look, if you're not satisfied with the terms... I'll make you a half partner. I'll give you 50%. That should make you about $30,000 for the season. My advice is to take 25% and be on the safe side. Let me see. 25%, that would give me $15,000. You're right. Not over 25%. - Is it a deal? - Sure. Right. Remember what I told you about not leaving me alone with, you know... Would you say he was crazy, or am I? I wouldn't say. What's the name of this place we're going to? The New Amsterdam. I used to go there in summer as a kid. You know, before the war. Which war? If this is the New Amsterdam, I'd hate to see the old one. I hope there are no wild animals around here. I'm cold. I think maybe... we ought to go home now. No. Edwin, you come with me. I wanna show you where we fished through the ice. I thought you said you only came here in the summertime. Well, I'll show you where we didn't use to fish through the ice. I think they want to be alone. I don't know what for. It's lovely, isn't it? Come on in. It's a bit drafty, don't you think? Well, we seem to be here, don't we? Let's sit down. - Won't you be too cold? - No. I like being off alone like this. You're not alone, you're with me. Then I like being off alone with you. I am a little cold. Flap your arms. That'll restore circulation. Look. Makes me feel warmer already. I doubt it. Come on, try it. It's good for you, you see? You know, if some people saw us like this, they might think that we were... that we liked each other. Yes, they might. It's funny how we met, and all that's happened to us since. The way we've been sort of thrown together and everything. As if it were all meant to happen. It's quite an experience. It's more than an experience. It's sort of like... a romance, isn't it? Yes, as we say in French, la belle romance. A swell romance. You know, you ought to be wearing galoshes. I think we'd better go home. You're not really angry? No, disappointed. Don't be that way. You're too nice. - You're nice, too, sometimes. - Only sometimes? There are times when I can't make you out. When you're so aloof. So I'm aloof, am I? Come on and play. He wants to play. I see. Of course. I'm sorry. You're sorry? I'm the one that got the snow in the face. You know something, snow tastes just as bad as water. Will you please try to square me with Mabel? - What about? - About making Lucky stop gambling. She's sore at me. All right, I'll try and fix it. You see, she doesn't understand the real reason. Now you try to explain to her... that if Lucky gets $25,000 ahead... he has to go back and marry that girl. What girl? - The girl he's engaged to. You see he... - Pop. Look, I've decided to throw all restraint aside. Don't bother me anymore. Now, where were we when Pop interrupted us? As I remember it, you had just called me aloof. No, it was a laugh. Seems to me I was just going to do something about it, too. Yes, I know. This is Ricardo Romero bringing you lovely music... from the starlit heavens of the new Silver Sandal cafe... on the gala night of our grand reopening. Everybody's here. - My, it certainly is beautiful, isn't it? - Yeah. You know, Edwin, we mustn't let these kids break up. Their future depends on it, and so does mine. And once we O'Neils have tasted diamonds and furs, we never forget it. I can't get over Lucky giving me this bracelet. Imagine me with a real diamond bracelet. You know, Pop... Well, the old slitch. Now listen, girlie, don't worry about me. You know, I often talk to myself. You see, I'm my own grandmother, and I have to keep the old girl interested. It's very lovely, Ricardo. I'm sorry, but I couldn't. - Please. It would make me so happy. - Hello. I was just asking Penny how can I keep my mind on the music... if she dresses like that. You'll just have to get used to it. That's part of my plan. You know, sometimes I should be left alone. Always. - Goodbye. - Bye. Where's Lucky? How should I know? - He doesn't interest you? - No, he doesn't. Hardly at all. I suppose it doesn't interest you that he was supposed to marry that girl... as soon as he got $25,000. Well, why doesn't he go back? Because he doesn't want to, and you know it. He's given up gambling. Certainly looks as if he's trying hard to go back to her, doesn't it? What am I supposed to do? Why don't you go up and give him a great big kiss? Don't be silly. I wouldn't do that... even if I wanted to. You mean you haven't got the nerve. - I've got nerve. - But not enough. Yes, I have. Not enough for that. I've got enough nerve to do anything. You know... - I think you have. - I know I have. Well, why don't you go ahead and do it? You do and I'll stand on my head. All right... I will. Come in. How do you like my dress? Why, it's nice. You like it? - Sure. - Thanks. Wait a minute. I think it's wonderful. The skirt's nice... - and the sleeves are nice. - It's a cape. The cape is nice... the back is nice... your hair is nice... and you... Hello. - Hello. - Hello. - Lucky, you're on next. - Am I? - It's nice. - You like it? - I certainly do. - Thanks. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. Bojangles of Harlem I beg your pardon, have you seen Mr. John Garnett? You mean Lucky? I mean John. No, I haven't. Either one of them. Hello, fellows. You don't want to... No. Clever? Well, sit down. - Have a drink. Make yourself comfortable. - Enjoy yourself. - So you do card tricks? - Sure, that's my specialty. I used to make my living doing this stuff. Lucky. John? - I don't know where he is. - I'll just wait for him. All right, just make yourself comfortable. There she is. - I don't know where it is, do I? - No, you could not. Can that boy shuffle. Ace of spades. Outside, sister. Come on. Well, thanks, fellows. Where's Penny? I've got to see her right away. - In her room. - You're staying here. Perhaps I won't. What's on your mind, Dice? I come to play you for the orchestra again. - No, you didn't. - Yes, I did. When we high-carded, I thought the game was on the level. It was. What about this guy? Seems like he knows a good deal about handling cards. Now listen, Dice, that game was on the level. No, it wasn't, Lucky. He pulled a cold deck on you, and I palmed the ace of spades on him. It was a nice friendly little game, wasn't it? Okay, Dice. - We'll use my deck. - And I'll shuffle. Lucky, don't be a sucker. Ten of diamonds. King of clubs. Okay. Simpson, give him the contract. Come over anytime and listen to Romero, free. John, where have you been? I've been looking for you. I wanted to tell you how wonderful you were. I'm glad you liked it. Thanks, Margaret. I'm glad to see you. Lucky, we'd better get ready if we're going to do the dance. There isn't going to be any dance. There isn't going to be any dance? Lucky lost the orchestra back to Raymond. We're finished. Lost the orchestra? But you said you weren't going to gamble anymore. You promised. What did you let him do it for? You told me he wouldn't gamble anymore... - because he'd have to go back and marry... - Penny, please. - This is Ms. Watson, my fiance. - How do you do? Hello. Why don't you laugh? It's all so very funny. I don't see anything funny. I do. - John, dear, I... - Margaret, look... I've got so many things to straighten out. Do you mind if I call you at your hotel tomorrow? Why, no, of course not. Good night. Please don't feel bad. You've still got me. Of course, I ain't a young and pretty girl. I ain't even a girl, but I'll stick. I'll never leave you. Hello. You can be the first one to congratulate us. I'd like to talk to Penny, please. All right, if you want to, but it won't do you any good. Ricky, please. All right, I'll be waiting for you in the car. Yes? I'm sorry, Penny. I'm sorry, too. - I've been trying to figure this thing out... - It's all decided now. For always? Yes. I'm going to marry Ricky when he takes the band to Bermuda in the spring. I'm sorry I lost my temper a while ago. - You had every right to. - No, I hadn't. No right at all. I thought you had. Goodbye. Never mind. I just want to wish you good luck... and all that. And all what? Whatever you want. Does she dance very beautifully? Who? The girl you're in love with. Yes. Very. The girl you're engaged to. The girl you're going to marry. I don't know. I've danced with you. I'm never going to dance again. Will that be all, miss? I think so, yes. May I come in? Hello, John, dear. Hello, Margaret. I didn't expect you. Please come in. - Won't you sit down? - Thank you. I'm so glad you've come, John. I've been so worried. There's something I must tell you. You poor boy. John, I don't want to add to your worries... - but I've got to tell you that... - No, please, let me first. You see... I don't know how to say it. Read this note. It explains everything. I'm going back home tonight and then... Don't read it until after I've gone. But you can't go until you know how I feel. I know how you feel, but my feelings... - Margaret. - I'm sorry. - Do you mean this? - Yes, John. I can't marry you. - You don't love me? - No, I'm sorry. Gee, that's swell. Swell? I mean, who are you going to marry? It's in there. Charlie Shaw. What do you think of that? We used to call him Goofy Shaw. He isn't goofy anymore. No, of course not, now that he's gonna marry you. You see, I've known him so much longer than I've known you and... Yes, but why didn't you tell me last night? I wanted to, but when I finally got to you, you seemed to be in a lot of trouble. - I was. - Well, I didn't want to add to it. - You wouldn't have. You were the trouble. - I? Yes, you see, I'm in love with that girl you saw. You mean that goofy girl? Yeah. No, she's not goofy. What do you mean she's... Was she angry at you because of me? Yes, isn't that marvelous? - And what are you laughing at? - I don't know. Come on, let us in on the joke. - We've just... - Thrown each other over. You know, I know just how you feel. I've been divorced a couple of times myself. I'm glad you're taking it so good, Lucky. I can take it, Pop. Because I've got to tell you that Penny and Romero... are getting married this afternoon. - What? - Yes, laugh that one off. Now do you think you can tell me? No. How did he look when you told him I was getting married? - Did his face fall? - Kind of. I stopped looking when his chin passed his arches. They were laughing so hard that all I heard them say... was that she had broken her engagement with him. Stop talking about him when you know I'm going to marry Ricky. I is sorry, gentlemen, but it's just like I told you. Mr. Romero ain't seeing nobody today. He is getting married. - He's getting married. - Is he? Of course he couldn't see anybody today. - I should say not. - Out of the question. The most ridiculous thing. That's what I always say. Hello, Ricky. Hello, Lucky. Or perhaps you should call me lucky today. Excuse me, boss, here's your baggage checks... and all your clothes are on the boat. It's going to be such a wonderful wedding. Raymond has been very nice and turned over the entire place to us. My own orchestra is going to be there and play. I made a special arrangement of the Wedding March myself... and we have a group of specially selected guests to attend the wedding. What are you laughing at? Those trousers. What's wrong with them? Why... no cuffs. Lucky, what are you doing here? You see, I... - You just came to laugh at my wedding. - No. I'm laughing because there isn't going to be any wedding. Yes, there is. No, there isn't. You wait here. So there you are. Where are my pants? Well, what about the wedding? There isn't going to be any wedding. Then you're going to marry him? Yes, I guess so. English
