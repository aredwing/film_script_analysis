Not in their head and not out loud. Not a fucking word. 'Cause everything has somehow gotten stuck. here, deep in the fields, under the trees and leaves, year after year. hen suddenly it all comes back, just like that, from one day to the next. No matter how long ago it was, there will always be someone to bring it all back. Because no matter what you do or think, one thing is for sure... you're always fucked. Now, tomorrow, next week, or next year, until the end of time, fucked. LIMBURG, BELGIUM What's this I've been hearing? ou're refusing to have ur cows?

Beard grwth, chest development, stronger muscles, the voice changing, penis development, erectins... becming a man... and ejaculations. Listen, he may recover. But yu absolutely must give him testosterone. Otherwise... I'm not having them inject my boy with that stuff. But Jacky no lnger has any testicles. S, we need to give him extra testosterne now during puberty s that he can develop normally. Otherwise he will never be a man. - Ask him. - No, yu ask him. We're all adults here. Ask me whatever it is you want to ask. Is he going to be gay? Diederik is the only ne who can testify against that bastard. No, no, no, Jean. Listen to me. If I let Diederik testify against Schepers' son, with all his cnnectins, he nly has to snap his fingers and we're screwed. ou and me. Do yu wanna start World War III with a mafia type like Schepers? I'm not going to jail, Jean. He knows way too much about us. Jail. That's what'd be waiting for us. And then Jacky would be all on his own. Do you know who the real criminal here is? ou, you coward!

Sporty, lemny, fresh, yung... for active men. It's hard to chse, isn't it? I know what we'll do. I'm gonna give you some samples. ou can try them at home.

Bye. - Bye. - The deal is off. - What did yu say? - Why? - Because something isn't right. Okay, so De Kuyper has a reputation. Like Eddy says, we need him. It's a great opportunity! De Kuyper is the kind of guy t whom mud never sticks. Let him score his own stuff. What we need to do is lay low... wait until they catch Daems' killer, and see who's left, eh? - Yeah. - We're doing well now. I dn't wanna get screwed because of that fool. ou're exaggerating. You act as if De uyper killed Daems himself. - Call it off! - Call it off! Calm down, guys! Let's go for a drink, kay? What's that I smell on you? Sam Raymond. 11:37. Leaves the Vanmarsenilles' farm. - Antony. - Hi, man. Eva isn't with yu? Must be smething special then. - We needn't do everything by the bk. - My thoughts exactly. We're nt exactly by the book, either, are we? I'm gonna get straight to the pint. I wanna see you again once this is over, but for nw we need t separate business... - From pleasure. Sure, man. Sht. - Sit down. - You're keeping things from us. - Me? I'm not. I'm warning you. Don't bullshit me. I'm nt jking. I'm a cop. Finding things out comes naturally. And I can feel you, my friend. I can smell you. I can feel something's not right. Jacky's dad was the ne who ratted on your dad to the plice. Resources were scarce, pliticians uninterested. Suddenly Father Vanmarsenille winds up with a case. Ideal fr the media and morale. S, Vanmarsenille gets immunity, and your dad ends up in jail. et they were good friends. And nw Jacky suddenly pops up in your entourage. - Diederik, something isn't right. - Jacky has nthing to do with this. We knew each ther, yes, but that was 20 years ago. Some shit happened back when we were little. Some heavy shit. - Sex abuse shit? - No, man. Look, what his dad did, I would've done the same. - urn your own dad in? - My dad is a coward. Was a coward. e made me shut up, and then he shut himself up. - I have to g. - Me, too. I've got a meeting with your prime suspect. Diederik, give us that one thing. Do it for yourself... and for us. This zoo was shut down by an animal rights organization. Since I'm a vet, they asked me to put the animals down. But instead of taking them to the slaughterhouse, I sold them. To restaurants. hat month, the fricans in Brussels were eating monkeys from a Limburg z, and snakes, and shit like that. Dinner is ready. Roast prk, vegetables, and croquettes. So, Richter... what do you do for a living? Ask and I deliver it. My prduct is called networking. - Very important. Very, very important. - hat's why we're all here tday. Smetimes networks break down. Especially the pharmaceutical kind, if yu know what I mean. he cops fund hormones in my meat, which led them to Pharmakin. S, Pharmakin dropped us like a brick. I dn't need to draw you a picture. hey made a deal with the cops. What can yu do in such a case? Be quicker than them, tougher than them. Make sure they're scared of yu, so they stop fuckin' me about. I think they got the message this time. Anyway, from now on, we're gonna concentrate more n the smaller supply chains. Small is beautiful. We dn't have a chice. We need to do something. And you will be our new supplier. Diederik, you're gonna help him. Richter will provide the contacts. What? Got a problem with that? No, f course nt. I just didn't expect it. hat's all. I'm driving back t Limburg tonight. Why don't you come along? hen you can see the Vanmarsenilles again.

Ditto, plus assault and theft. hey were seen at Vanmarsenille's. - A team's on its way t arrest them. - I've gt a message from my infrmant. Eva, it's Diederik. Something's going on. I've gotta go and intimidate two Walloons named David and Christian. Oh, fuck! Are you guys the mechanics David and Christian? - Who wants t know? - Richter. Fuck. e sends you a message. If you ever say a wrd about that BMW, he will cut off your balls and make sausages out of them. - What? - Uh? Knackwurst! - Hello! - What are yu doing here? A friend. She can wait.

It's my cusin David. e introduced me to the fuckin' Flemish bastard. I want you two to steal a car for me. My cousin Christian is a nice guy, unlike some of his friends... Don't wrry, my Flemish friend. Making cars disappear is our specialty. I knew he wuldn't get rid of the car. e was gonna sell the parts. he next day, Christian shows up with a BMW. A BMW 5 Series. - It's dne. - Stolen... In Lige. Lige? No way. David stole the BW in Namur. Richter came back a few days later with some Flemish fascist bastard. A butcher, a fat pig, with a Bruges football scarf. I didn't ask questions but said to myself, "David, how come you know these Flemish bastards?" My Flemish friends. "What are you doing with people like this?" Five hours later, that Flemish mercenary was back again. He dumps the car in the garage, and what do I see? A bullet hole! - If yu ask me... - hey must've killed someone. hat hormone cop. - What tires? - Christian wanted to sell them. Ah, those tires. I knew ne of the Vanmarsenille brothers drove a BMW, so I thought, why not him? I know him well. He often pops in on his way to the whores. So, I swapped the tires and put the old tires on Richter's BMW. The next day, I heard the news on the radio. The first thing I did was drive to the Vanmarsenilles' to get the tires back. hat's when things took a turn for the worse, especially... especially for Christian. My phone! Wanna knw where the tires are? Well, I'll tell you where. Richter and the ther Flemish bastards, they work for Jacky Vanmarsenille. He's sick. He's got a head like a bull. The tires from the murder scene, they're at his place. his is Richter's address, and De uyper is hled up with that woman. Okay, fine. - Diederik. - Eva. The Vanmarsenilles. hey've really got nothing to do with this? No. I've never seen Sam with De Kuyper befre, let alone Jacky Vanmarsenille. - That was just... - Stop whining, Diederik. Fuck you! He's not being made the fall guy, 'cause cincidentally... Cincidentally? ou know what I think about cincidence! It is what it is, okay? Go home and don't say a word to De Kuyper about being arrested.
