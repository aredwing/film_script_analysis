He gave me his version of freedom. To tell me I must talk about Piggy, and all the violence. And how I was part of it. A YEAR EARLIER At the beginning of the year I work as a messenger. I went with packages, letters... everything. What was now needed. It was my first job for several years. I had been too shy to work. - I would not at home. - You full on Friday? - No. - Well... He baked in the thick girl. - No. - And you actually spoke with people. It was not a good job for me. It was hard to be so close to the other. And the longer I was with them, the less with I felt. Maybe we feel all such of time. So I thought about possible dangers in most situations. - Delivery. - Thank you! And your name is? Sorry! Sorry! Otherwise it was day one.

He presses burger down like this. So he can get it into his mouth. "You must take it apart." "Oh no!" Then he opened his mouth up. Pushed inside. There is a cocktail stick in the middle of the burger. - I'm sorry. - Sit down, fool. - See how you go, buddy. - Dude? What the hell is that? Blackcurrant Juice? You want something, matching blouse? Hello! - Flat now down your pussy! - Go to your friends. Go on. You're on thin ice. It's okay. I am calm. - Try, when you feel strong. - Shut up! Go to hell! - Crush him, mate. - It's okay. Damn...

They will through me to reach you. I'm just tired. Long days. Okay. Come here. Call us next week. You can ask me out, you owe me the money. Now he sticks out! I can not take much more the crap here. Hello? What? When? Hey. John Burgess, came in this morning. - I'm his brother. - Burgess? Ground 5th To the right. Claire. It is very bad. You, do you remember me? What? Do you remember me? Mgfisse! Do you remember me, your pussy? You're dead! Damn! Fucking... Pussy! Pivskid! Nurse! Nurse! There were people enough to justify a ufuldbyrdet life. It is always good to make the family proud. have something to hold on to on days like this. the morning I smoked grass and got drunk. Almost forgot everything about that day. The days flowed like just together. Life just kinda happened. Nothing mattered, for nothing stood out. It was like trying to see with a spotlight in the eyes. My best friend was gone. Where was I who should I charge? How could I punish them for what they had taken from me? But one thing I knew. To those who murdered John, not have been afraid. But it should have been. Hey, buddy. Is everything all right? Yes. - Do I know you? - Yes. When you were little, I knew your brother. Okay. Do you have some spare time? I will talk to you. The security above all. It's good. I like it here, Joe. Fucking... cozy and such. Domestically. - What do you want? - I read what has happened. It was terrible. Awful. - How did you know about me? - I and John were old friends. We went to school together. Yes, I think I recognize you. I... - I read about what has happened. - Is that why you are here? Yes... Yes. See. Fine. Who are you? I'm Piggy, Joe. You can call me Piggy. It makes all. Yes. I think I remember you from when I was a child. May I sit down? Rar. It was horrible. Yes. You know, it just feels... It feels as if there never something is done about it. - Yes. - That's right. Someone should do something about it, Joe. - Yes. - And you must be angry. - I am. - I would be damned angry. It's horrible. Awful. - Your own brother. - Yes. I mean... Your own flesh and blood. Your brother, Joe. When these things happen... ... Do not have anything. - How does it feel. That's it. If you do not do anything. Yes. It's really terrible, it happened. But I'm glad I came. It was great to see you again. - Yes, that was it. - See you again, right? - Absolutely. - Yes. I trades always around. I can look into, say hi. I'll see myself out. I dreamed about Piggy. At work I thought about him all day. Where I had seen him before. Where he came from. I met him more and more often. I told everything that had happened. He would help me. It was nice that someone said, that he loved me. - I bought something for you. - Why? - It can cheer you up. - Jas? - It makes you happy. - What is it? I know how happy you are cooking. - You do well to cook? - Of course. See here. Look at that bastard. - You enjoy cooking, right? - Yes. - And then you have to use a sharp knife. - Yes. - Right? - Yes. - Thank you. It was nice of you. - You're welcome. I enjoyed it. The ones I talk about Joe... It's the good, like you and me. Or the evil. The vicious. The monsters, Joe. But you have to drop the fear, mate. You can make the world to submit to your will. Whatever it is. Using lies. Using violence. Use whatever. My old grandmother always said: "If you can not get something, boy... so take it, damn it. " Trust me, Joe. I will help you. Why would you help me? Because I loved your brother. I loved him, Joe. And I know those people. You would like my help, Joe? You would suppose that I help you? Yes. Yes. Okay. We go out. Apart? Now? Out. Now. You and me. I have something for you, Joe. Something I will show you. You'll like it here. It is a gift more. Can you see it now? Do you remember him? Yes. Come! Do nothing. Say nothing. Follow me. Hello! - Yes? - Sorry to disturb your evening stroll. - Do you know him? - Who the hell are you? No, you know him. Look closely. You know him for sure! Look closely. You know him. - I do not know you, man! - Kill him. I've never seen you before. Tell him! Kill him. No... Joe! Joe! Come here! It's all right, Joe! It's okay! Joe! Joe! It's okay. You'll be fine. He just will not rob you again. Hopefully he plunders nobody. It's okay, buddy. It's okay. It's okay. So. It's all in order. It's okay. Now we go. We go our way. Hell, Joe. It's just me. Take it easy, Joe. It was a joke. I was just kidding! Piggy told me what I should clear and non-clear - When I ought to say, take control, say no. He showed me situations, and how they should have been tackled, - To minimize damage, or lasting damage. This is London, Joe. Understand it. The fear in people's eyes. He explained to me on body language. things I had never thought of before. Your brother often talked about you. - Did he? - Yes. Two minutes, Joe. Piggy said that he did not would kill an innocent. He would kidnap one of them and get him to say who attended. He said that if we made a mistake, we would be just as bad as them. The plan seemed good, so was no undue sacrifice. Perfect. It is here we go with from now on. What? - Why are you laughing? - It's a pig nose. Yes. And you have to have it on when we go out. - Why? - We must apron us, Joe. Shall we? No one has seen us yet. It comes to the. And then they will notice a disguise. - And that is what they will remember. - Okay. So... The more silly disguise is... ... The less they will be able to remember otherwise. Think. All they will remember This pig's snout. And believe me, if the goofy snout the last thing they see before they die- - They arrive to hell humiliated. Psychology, right? It's fucking smart. Honestly. About one hour is dark. - What should I say to her? - Do not respond. How are you? Are you outside? Wait a minute, I let you in.. You better hide in the other room. Do not lose focus, Joe. Do not lose focus. Hey, you. I miss him so. That's it. I do not know how to work with it. - Nothing gets better. It does not heal. - Yes, I know what you mean. And that someone did that to him... It was not an accident. - I'm sorry. He's your brother. - It does not matter. I'm not an angry person. I care about others. I'm not hateful. - I know. - But if I could... I think it is clear... But how can you live with this in the head rest of your life? They took not only his life, but also his past. Because you can not think of him without thinking about them. Are you okay? Yes, it is. How do you know? I got it just right. John loved you very much. Do you think they ever catch them, Joe? They get caught. I promise you. Okay. - We know that there were five. - Yes. One by one, Joe. One by one. A very cheerful assembly. Ham in blue. We follow him. Look where he lives. How we begin. He is alone. Take your nose on. Now it's not kidding. When I say, so get the car. Do not think, just do it. - What did I say? - Get the car. - What? - Get the car. Ready? Come on. Get the car. Run. Take his cap. Do you know why you are here? Take his knevel of. What is this? What the hell are you doing? I must... Get me out of here! You're dead, do you know? Damn fool! You are not in a situation where you should swear at anyone. Take it easy! Damn! Guess what... I know that you know who killed John. I can guarantee that you were there. It was not me! I know. There were 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 of you. Just say who they are. Save yourself. I do not know what you're talking about. Yes, you do, you bastard. I'll find them. I find the bastards. I beat them all to death. I'll start with you. - Yes. - I know nothing. I'll start with you. Damn... Relax. He comes up. Yes, it's just... He looks very paltry out. He'll be fine. Hi, this is Joe. I'm not coming in today, because... I do not feel so good. Thank you. See you tomorrow, I think. - Did I say that I move? - No. I can not afford without him fool Justin. - Is it over? - Yes. - I did not like him. - Why not? I did this just is not. You can help me move, if you want. Have you heard that they have arrested someone for murder? - No. - A local newspaper wrote about it. "The arrest was connected to..." But they were shown released - I think they are all happy. - Yes. Sorry, I'm talking about it. It's okay. It feels alligevel not virkeligt. To the well, that there is virkeligt? Yes. - What is that? - You next, I'm here for you? Yes. - What do you want that low? - Just be together. - What do you want? - The same. - I think about it.

We are finished. We are finished! - We're done, Joe! Finished! - What the hell? - We have been seen on film. - How the hell did you get in? When we took Craig, filmed a camera us. We're done, dude. Finished! We must finish this tonight. Tonight! I can not do it here. We run away immediately. - No, we take Danny, tonight! - It is ridiculous. - No, mate. Let me think. - The decision was made for us, Joe! I do not know what to do. Do you go from me, Joe? You do not suppose? I did not say. It's just... It is much to cope with. We must be one step ahead. We take it, we can take in the evening. We save us, we wait a year, we'll take Jamie. But you do it this time, Joe. You do it! For your wonderful brother John. I did not know what thoughts was mine or Piggys. By sharing brain with anyone. to be full of ideas, which may not be one's own. I trusted no longer on my intuition. What food I liked. Music, clothes... Who is it? Come on! Who the hell is that? Come on! Who the hell are you? Hell... Who the hell are you? What are you in my house? It did not quite as planned. I can not do it here. - Joe, stay. - It's over. - I do not want more. - How it works not. - Says who? - You! This is what you wanted! Come on! I knew what I wanted. My brother's murderer. I wanted them dead. But it was imagination. Now it felt like that when we did this, we destroyed the imagination. That's the problem with a fantasy. As soon as it becomes reality, It no longer exists. Do not be afraid. You can come home after this. Every day I waited for the police. When the phone rang, because I up. When the doorbell rang, I hid. I began to hope killings would stop. Piggy would travel now, where we had all we could. And for a while everything was quiet. But only one time. Joe? Joe! Wake up, Joe! Wake up, honey, the food is ready. Joe? Joe! Damn! Banks never on? We're going to hunt, Joe. What? - What the hell are you doing? - I told you, she made you crazy. You know nothing about her. Do not mix her into this. We're going out, Joe. Tonight. What are you talking about? It is no more left. Yes, it is. There are other, Joe. You can help. We are finished! It's over! Okay? We are not finished, Joe. We are not finished, Joe! We are not finished, Joe. We are not finished. We are not finished. We are not fucking finished. I have no idea who the hell you are. I have no idea who the hell you are. I have no idea who the hell you are! I have no idea... Why do you never talk about, what happened? - I do not know. - It's just... I see no reason for it. I know you're upset. It felt just not. If you wanted to talk about it... If you would be upset... Why would anyone want to be outraged? I did not mean it like that, but just... If you wanted to talk about it... I'm here. The only thing in my head. I mean... ... Nothing changes just because you walk up to it. Well? Well... Rubbish... Good or bad. Nothing changes you No matter what you think. I understand. That's my fault. It was my fault. Are you okay? Associate you not to me, you hear! You are still safe. It was my fault! Piggy! Piggy? THE notorious DRUG SELLER AND BAND LEADER RITLER convicted Today RITLERS RECORD LONG PENALTY You knew nothing of John, do you? You've never met him! What the hell does that mean? Good grief... What role does it, Joe? You could do what you wanted. I gave you just an excuse. I did it all right by saying that it was not. You're crazy. And you could have stopped, when you wanted to. But you did not. You did not, for you have made you a victim. You are weak. You're just like the others who do not stand by it. You are fucking weak. You are meaningless. You are a shadow. Your brother knew it safe. And you knew it for sure. And all the others who were fortunate enough to socialize with you- - Over the last 20 years a your miserable life, knows it too. And you know what, buddy? That's why you're so good at violence. For the weak people. You are tough to commit violence because You have so much repressed anger. You do not know how to be yourself. You do not know how to be someone else. And what happened your brother... It gave you just an excuse to do what you did. And that's all people like you need, right? An apology. One way to get it to feel right. You are a mirror, Joe. You're a fucking mirror of what is out there. For every miserable bastard, who got up and went out today. What is it, buddy? Have I made you angry? It's a damn shame, Joe. I thought really about you. I really did. You can go now. Just go. Now I understood, exactly what to do. I understood what Piggy had taught me what he would say. when John died, I died too. That was it. I was tied to it. I could not put it behind me. And now there was only one way to move forward. I'm moving in a few weeks. I have to do a lot. It's a shame, Joe. You are always welcome here again. Thank you. This is for me now. Piggy was an Avenger. He arranged things I could not. He changed everything. Piggy was all they wanted him to be. I knew he would not die. Now I knew that it was my responsibility to finish what we had started. And I promise to finish it.
