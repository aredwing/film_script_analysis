Your boy is sicker than we know. The iv's are the only thing sustaining him as it is. We're going to have to supplement that With a full complement of life-Support systems, If we're going to have any chance to sustain him. "Sustaining." "Chance." I don't want my son sustained. And i don't want any chances. I want him cured. Eli. There's gotta be something you can do. A month ago, he was a healthy, Perfectly all right, happy kid There's a chemical imbalance, An occult malignancy in his system. What kind of medicine are you practicing here, doctor? What we have is a pituitary gland That has gone crazy, out of control. It's causing much too rapid rate of growth. No matter what nourishment we give him, It just isn't enough. Now, i thought it might be genetic, inherited. But metabolic tests that we did on both of you Show that you're normal as pie So unless there's something we don't know, Unless there's something left out of the picture... Eli. No. No. No. Eli, please. Atlanta or maybe houston... First thing we gotta do Is get him the hell out of here And someplace where they know what they're talking about. We can't just wish it away We can't just go on pretending it never happened. 17 years ago, I was attacked And nothing's ever gonna change that fact He... He is my son. He is my own son and nobody else's. Yes, he is your son. You love him and he loves you. And whatever we find out won't change that. But michael is dying. We can't afford not to find out who was responsible. You heard what dr. Odom said: "Something more to go on." , that man, his background His medical records, may be that something more No! No! No. No. No! No! Aah! No! No-Aah! You're leaving. No, sweetheart Yes, you are. You're leaving me. I'm just going with daddy for a little while. Just where we think we can do you best.

Nobody, Daddy, Dr. Odom or me Is ever gonna let that happen to you I'll see you real soon, now. You okay? I'm fine. Well, the fog is rolling in. Well... Looks peaceful enough. There's the courthouse Hi. Well, hi there, yourself. Um... i'd like to get some information. Honey, you've come to the right place I'm just a fount. Yes, ma'am . May i help you I'd like to look through your back issues, if i could. Oh, why? I'm from jackson, the extension school. Is that a fact I'm writing a book on crime in rural america. This isn't jackson . This isn't even shreveport There's no crime around here, Excepting an occasional barn burning. You know, strictly local stuff to be exact. That's exactly what i'm looking for. Something to give me a feel of the area. Well, the morgue's in the back if you gotta feel out the area You only got a few minutes. It's near lunchtime. And i don't have anybody to mind the office And i'm not putting anybody on. You help yourself, you hear? Judge, mayor And sometime that pig-Headed son of a bitch. What can i do for you? The clerk outside, mrs. Gumfrey, Said you might be able to help me with an assault that Happened here about 17 years ago. What kind of assault? Rape. Maybe... It wasn't described that way. I'm interested in any possible Act of violence, Any Memorable behavior. I'm sorry, i can't help you...mister? Maccleary, Eli maccleary. Well, i hope you won't hold The peaceableness of our little nioba Against you, just the same. Thank you. Thank you, sir It's lunchtime. Almost. Hey, missy, i said it was lunch. Coming. Eli! I know. But she ripped out that whole front page, All about lionel and... Who's that with her? Well, if you was to give me odds, I'd say it was her husband. You didn't tell him anything? All right. Oh lord, i better get ahold of dexter and horace. We don't want them forgetting themselves. We're real sorry, ma'am. That's why it's a small town. Yeah, we'll look into it. Thank you for calling. Excuse me, uh... Sheriff brand? Pool, bill pool. Sheriff brand retired in '65. Well, could you tell us where we can find him? He passed on in '69. You're just a tad late. We were hoping that sheriff brand could tell us about Lionel curwin's murder. I was deputy when it happened. We're researching a book, Crime in small town america. What you wanna know? Everything. First off, lionel curwin was a son of a bitch, If you'll pardon my french, ma'am. Everybody was praying he'd give out. But nobody was praying for the way he finally did. What do you mean? I mean he was ripped to pieces. Parts of him was eaten, what parts was recognizable. What did it to him A wild animal? An animal that'll tear a man to pieces And then try to set fire to his house? Then who? We don't know. Whoever it was hasn't done it again. It's been quiet as a graveyard around here ever since. Well.. Thanks anyway for your help, sheriff You bet. Where is he? The maccleary boy, where is he? Hello? Yes, it is. What? When? Who is it? It's dr. Odom. Michael's missing. Will you let me sleep? You have to promise me first. Will you promise me? All right. You can come out now. I know you're in here. I know you are. Missy, where is that delivery boy? What do you mean, he's already delivered it? I have turned this kitchen upside down. Missy, that boy ain't worth the pottage you pay him. I've turned the kitchen upside down And i'll be damned if i can find Hide nor crumb of his order! Shit. Bye-Bye. Koko! Come on in here, sweetheart. It is about time. Well, come on. Bring it on in, please. Don't be dropping it. You boys always dropping things. I guess you play with yourselves too much. Missy said no more than $5 for the meat And i expect her to stand by it. She said $5, and carry the 2, that's 12... All that's left over is for you. What kind of slave wages is missy paying you? You're the hungriest, drooling somebody I ever did see. Sit down. There's enough here to feed an army, anyhow. 'Course, if we could extend it a little. Maybe if i crushed up some saltines in it. No, that's too pretty to do that to it. I know. Put a little of this in it and that makes it real good. How do you like yours? I like mine rare. Makes waiting easy. Oh, koko. Koko! Where the hell are you, darling? Koko! What's that? No, it can't be. Not this time of year. You hear it? Do you hear it Aagh! Aagh! Aagh! Tipper, it's dinner. Tipper! Tipper- Tipper. Tipper, you bad boy. Okay. Okay. He's sleeping peacefully now. I think it best we don't disturb him. He'll be fine, mrs. Maccleary Don't worry. Platt girl found him Wandering around over at their place. Judging by the scratches, He must have come through the woods. He looks so good. Lord, after al l he's been through, He actually looks so much better. Anyway, the scratches are minor. I told you there was nothing wrong with our son. Nothing that some simple, Decent medical care couldn't cure. Well... Yes and no. Right now, sleep's the best medicine. Well, we could all use a little of that, doc. There's nothing you can do here. I think you're right. Morning, dexter. Newspaper isn't open yet. It's past 10:00. D such a thing hasn't happene Since the night lionel's house was torched. Thank you, dexter. Edwin? The tests all seem to show he's still fine. What are you 3 going to do now? Maybe we better take you to houston, Have them really check you out. Just to be sure. No. Houston?

It was my brother lionel He's the one who did it. He's the one who turned him into whatever he is. None of us knew what to do with lionel Would you like to hear something? My brother lionel, He wouldn't even touch sarah, His own wife. Know why? He thought it was sinful. You think sarah ran off with billy, don't you? She didn't. She never got the chance. When he caught billy and her together, He like as went crazy. He killed her all right. Yeah. But that wasn't good enough for him. Oh, no. He had to take billy And lock him up in that cellar. And he kept him there Until billy couldn't stand it anymore, Until he was starving. And lionel, He opened up that cellar door And he says: "Billy, "You still want her? "Well, now you can have her." And he throws her body down. After that, it was easy. Lionel, The town undertaker, Robbing his own coffin s to feed billy his flesh, The human fles h billy needed to live. Ha, it was easy. And you all covered for him. No, Not till dexter found.. Found his body He found it all. Jesus christ, man, i didn't even know about your wife! But he got out.

It wasn't our fault. It wasn't our fault. As soon as we found out, We went after him. We did! And you left him to die. And somehow he got back to that cellar, The only place he ever knew. We just found his remains. My god! Get down! Over there! All right, everybody, get back by the cells. Get it! Eli, Cover the back Jeff! Sheriff, lock me in here. It's the only safe place. Doc, shut him up! A gun... Give me a gun! He's coming through. For god's sake, give me a gun! Give it to him. What's that? The cicadas. They're coming after me! They're coming after me. Your gutless hide is safe. He'd have to kill us first. Got to come through that door, There's no other way. Aagh! Jeff, let's go. Doc! Oh, my god! She's still alive. Let's get her to the hospital. Oh, there's so much blood.
