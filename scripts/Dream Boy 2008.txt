[Engine turns over] NATHAN: We used to live in Lake Charles, but my dad got a job where he moves around a lot. We live by the lake on Poke's Road. Well, welcome, Nathan. And thank you. It doesn't look like your daddy's gonna make it home for dinner. Father, we come to You in the name of Jesus. We pray for each other's needs as we know them to be, and, Father, as you know them to be. Give us the courage and ability to be a strong witness for You. Why don't you come sit up here? I got so much stuff to do on top of my homework, I'm about to go crazy. You have to work? I got chores to do for my dad. I got a prayer group meeting at church. And I got this paper to write in English, and I don't want to. I'm good at that kind of stuff. You are? I like English. Well, I'll come over later, and you can help me. It's about railroads. The paper is. I could help you with some other stuff, like math. I'm pretty good at math. Okay. See ya. Bye. [Horse neighs] Yeah, I wanna go. I like Brother Will. I like him better than Preacher Rutherford. All he does is talk about sinners and going to hell. I'm tired. I was dancing all day. You gotta let me come watch you practice some time. You want a ride? Yeah. We should probably go. All right. [Engine turns over] You sure it's okay? Yeah, I was just finishing up my homework while you were doing your chores. Mrs. Johnson says you skipped a grade. You're supposed to be pretty good at English, even if you are younger than me. I just hate to write stuff. I like it okay. I copied this down from the World Book Encyclopedia. There's a lot of information here. You should really narrow down your topic. What about just "steam engines"? All right. I thought you boys might want something to drink. Thank you, Ma'am. I guess I ought to be embarrassed, getting a kid like you to help me with my homework. I take English with the juniors. That's just one grade below you. I'm not a kid. Why, I didn't mean it bad. I just mean you're a bit younger than me, that's all. I appreciate the help. You'll like living out here in the summertime. It's real peaceful. Nobody comes around. Is it okay to walk in the woods? Yeah, I go out there all the time. There's some great places out there. Camping grounds, Indian burial mounds. There's even a haunted house and stuff. I'll show you. I bet you have a lot of work to do because it's a farm. Yeah. It's all outdoor stuff. I like that. What about you, Nathan? Did you ever live on a farm before? No. We lived in towns mostly before. But my dad wanted to live in the country this time. So, why'd you move out here? Nobody moves to St. Francisville. Well, my dad got a job. He's selling tractors in Shenandoah. You sure do like this school stuff, don't you? It's all right, I guess. I don't see how anyone could like school. Beats staying home all the time. So you stay at home too much, huh? We can fix that. NATHAN'S MOM: Nathan, it's almost bedtime, sweetheart. It's good. Thanks, Nathan. [Cow lows] You want to hold on to these for me? Hey, Nathan. Hi. Hey, my dad's got a new Marlin. She got some real kick to her. We should check it out this weekend. Do us some deer huntin'. You ever been huntin' before, Nathan? No. You should come. Even if you don't kill anything, hunting's fun. We should go out for the whole weekend and camp out. I mean, we've been talking about going campin'. Yeah, it's all been talk 'cause someone can't get away from the girlfriend for a weekend, spend time with his buddies. Yeah, you're the hold up, Roy. What do you say? [Bell rings] Bye. See ya. [Door closes] I told you I was coming. Did you forget? No. Algebra's simple. You learn to work from both sides of the equation. So, Mr. Sawyer's department store sells socks, six pair for $1.97. How many nickels in $1.97 if you have four quarters, six dimes, and two pennies? Well, first you subtract. Then you divide to find the value of x. There's a graveyard over yonder. Can we go there? You sure you want to? I want to. The Kennicutts used to own all this land, that's what people say. There were two Kennicutt plantations, one that burned down, and another one off in the woods. Why is it called Poke's Road? Poke's Road stretches a long way. There must have been some Pokes on it once upon a time. Bring my books in the morning. I'm going on home. Where'd you go? Out back. There's a graveyard out there. By yourself? No, with the boy next door, Roy. Oh. He's a nice boy. There's a Western on the TV. You ought to come watch it with your dad. No, sir. All right. Go on to bed. PREACHER ROBERTS: John chapter 13, verses 21 through 26. "Jesus was deeply troubled, and He testified, 'One of you will betray Me.' The disciples looked at one another, at a loss as to whom He meant. One of His disciples, the one Jesus loved, was reclining at His side. John leaned back on Jesus' chest and said, 'Master, who is it? ' Jesus answered, 'lt is the one to whom I will hand the morsel after I have dipped it.' So he dipped the morsel, and he handed it to Judas, son of Simon the Iscariot." Let us pray. You comin' in? Yeah. What are you doing after? I've got homework, and I've got to run an errand. You want some company? No, I've got to pick up a prescription for my mom. She's waitin' on it. Is she okay? Yeah, she is. Do you want to go inside? [Vehicle approaches] Touch me. Did you ever do this before with anybody? You promise? I promise. I've never done this with anybody. 'Cause it's okay if it's just me and you. - Hi, Roy. - Hi, Mom. - Hi, Nathan. - Hi. Roy tells me you just moved here from somewhere, but for the life of me, I can't think of where. Lake Charles. Yeah. We used to lived in Slidell before that. And Pearl River. Pearl River's a nice town. Don't you get tired of moving around so much? Sometimes. But it's all right, though. Your family go to the Baptist church in Clinton? Yes, Ma'am. You know, we go to the Holiness church in Jackson. And I just wanted to tell you that your daddy and your momma and you are welcome to join us anytime. Thanks, Ma'am. Well, I better go look after Roy's daddy. If you boys want anything, let me know. Thanks, Ma'am. It was nice meeting you. Nice to meet you. You wanna go riding around town tonight? I have to ask my mom. I'm sure she'll say yes if you come with me. Hey, Mom. Please, Ma'am, I was hoping you might let Nathan come out riding with us tonight. Well, you know your daddy don't like you to run around, and we got that church supper tonight. I don't have to go this time, do I? Well... No. Him and me in church is plenty for one night. Thanks, Mom. Thanks, Ma'am. I'll have him back by 11:00, I promise. Get ready. I'll meet you by my truck. Nathan? Yes, Mom. Do you need some money? I got $5. You know, your daddy's been real nervous lately, and I couldn't get him to lay down last night. He didn't rest. NATHAN: So, where are we goin'? We're gonna go meet Randy and Burke. You drink beer? Yeah. You reckon' you can keep quiet about it? It doesn't bother me that you drink beer. It's okay. Answer my question. I can keep quiet about it. I can keep quiet about anything. We're going swimming. That's where we're going. But I can't swim. You can watch me. BURKE: Yeah! [Laughing] - BURKE: Did you see that ride? - RO Y: Yeah, sure did. What'd you think about that? It's pretty high. It's high, all right. I bet you won't do it. I bet I won't either. I'm with you, Nathan. I ain't jumping off that top part either. I got no need to break my neck. Well, I do. Whoo! [Laughter] Glad you came out here with us, Nathan. Let him alone, Burke. He can't swim. Well, maybe he'll learn if I throw him in. Don't bother him, Burke. I mean it. Are you man enough to jump in the water right now, or am I gonna have to throw you in? - I don't want you to throw me in! - Then you better jump! I want you to let me go! Leave him alone! Let go of him! I didn't throw him in the water. I should have, though. Nice ride, buddy. RAND Y: Yes, it was. What do you think? It looked like something was chasing you all the way down. I wish I could swim. I'll teach you. Next time, it'll be just us. You wanna go somewhere now? Wanna go to a movie or somethin'? I don't mind. Do you mind? What? Comin' out here. No, I don't mind. Well, we could go to a movie sometime, too. I ain't tryin' to hurt anybody. You ain't hurt nobody. Touch me. [Grunts] Where'd you learn screwing like that? Huh? Who taught you to screw like that? Answer me! Nobody. You're a liar. No, I'm not. [Engine turns over] Roy? Roy, please. NATHAN'S MOM: Harland. Come on downstairs. [Sighs] Nathan. I'm talking to you, Nathan. I know you're awake. I saw your eyes come open. Did you have a good time tonight? You better answer me, or I'm coming in there. Yes, sir. Your mom was the one who said it was all right for you to go out. It wasn't me. Where'd you boys go? Swimming. Did you go swimming, too? No, sir. That's right. You don't know how. Open your eyes, Nathan. Look at your dad. I'm sleepy. Open your eyes. NATHAN'S MOM: Harland. Harland, what're you doin' up there? I'm talkin' to Nathan. Come on downstairs. Leave him alone. He's tired. Let me check on Nathan for a moment. I'll be down there in a little while. You promised me that you wouldn't bother him. I told you it's all right. I'm checking on him to see if he had a good time. You shouldn't let him go out like that. He ought to come to church with us. He can come to church with us on Sunday. Come on downstairs. Please. Come on. [Harland screams] Did he touch you?! Did he touch you?! Nathan? You out here? I called you a couple times. Everything all right? Yeah, everything's fine. I was kind of hoping I'd get to see you on Friday. I had some stuff I needed to do. I know that there's something wrong. Why don't you just tell me what it is? What is it? Did I do something? No, nothing. I just got to get home. Roy, wait. Please. Nathan! Nathan! RO Y'S MOM: Roy! Come back! [Snoring] [Sobbing] How long have you been out here? Since after supper. You were out here last night, too. Yeah. I gotta go inside pretty soon. My parents will be wondering where I am. Hey, it's okay. I'll be fine. You can't stay out here. Yes, I can. You should come to my house. Your parents will send me home. You can sleep in the barn tonight. I'll show you a place. You and your folks have a fight? Yeah, somethin' like that. You'll be safe in here, okay? Thanks. Good mornin'. Did you sleep? Yeah. I think your mom is awake. The light's on in your kitchen. I'll hide these. You get ready for school, okay? Don't run from me! Get away from him! So I talked to Burke and Randy. We're gonna go camping this weekend. All right. About time you lazy assholes got here. I see you got your ma to let you come with us. That's good. Nathan ain't no baby. So, where we goin'? It's a secret place my uncle showed me. A good long walk into the woods. Pretty far from everything. - What the fuck's here? - You'll see. We'll see? Hush up, Burke. Enjoy the walk. So much for nice weather. You don't want none for yourself? No. What's the matter? You want some more? I'm good. All right. You tell me when, partner. A lot of people killed in these woods. Don't start now, Roy. No, I mean it. Two men just killed here last summer, wasn't it? That's right. Two of 'em. RO Y: Them two suckers from East Baton Rouge. They found one of them hanging upside-down with his nuts cut off. You two sonofabitches don't scare me. You know a lot of stories, Roy, don't ya? What do you say, Randy? You want to hear some ghost stories? Suit yourself. All right. So this man from Madisonville was goin' out with this girl he shouldn't have been goin' out with 'cause she was married. She didn't want to leave her husband 'cause he was a rich man, and they lived in this huge mansion together. So this man, Jimmy Hicks, decides he's gonna kill this guy 'cause he wants this girl all to himself. So he drives up to this huge mansion with doors, like, nearly twice the size of him, and he knocks on the door three times. [Knocks three times] The woman's husband comes out, and he pulls a hatchet from behind his back. The guy tries to plead with him, but it doesn't make any difference. So he turns and runs, and Jimmy brings the hatchet right down on the guy's back. And he doesn't stop there. He keeps on swinging, and he chops the guy up into little bits. With that last swing, he cuts the guy's hand right off. Now he decides he's gonna bury him in his own backyard. So he takes him out back, digs a grave, tosses the body in piece by piece. Then, when he's finished, he remembers the bloody hand with all the fingers. Dammit, Burke! Cut it out! But he goes back, and the hand's not there. So he figures he must have buried it. He goes home, takes a shower, washes all the blood off. When he comes out, it's dead quiet. He hears a knock at the door. [Knocks three times] So he goes up to the peephole. No one there. So he figures his mind's just playing tricks on him. So he turns, goes to bed. Now, sometime in the middle of the night, he wakes up. He can't breathe. He reaches out, but there's nobody there. There's a weight on his throat. And he tries to get up, and he goes to the mirror by his bedside, and he sees the hand wrapped around his throat. Now, every now and then, police in Madisonville find two lovers dead. They don't even bother questioning anybody, 'cause they know it's the curse that was brought on by Jimmy Hicks that's done 'em in. You scared yet, Nathan? No. [Thunder rumbles] Do you hear that? A storm's coming in. We better get some more wood for the fire. Come on. - Need some help? - Naw, it's okay. VOICE: [Whispers] Nathan. What are you looking at? Nothin'. Just listening to the wind. [Animal howling] Listen to that. Wild. It sounded like someone's voice. It's the rain. Come on. [Rain falling] Thank you for bringing me out here. I used to go camping when I was little with my dad all the time. We don't do much stuff like that anymore though. I've never been camping with my dad before. I don't like your dad much. He came out to the barn the other day to talk to me. He talked about you some. He said he noticed we were getting to be good friends. He was glad you were getting out of the house. He said you were too quiet, you live in your head. You stayed home too much. He said that you make up things that never happened before. I think he figured out I knew where you were sleepin'. Do you mind when I don't do the same thing back to you? No, I don't mind. Careful, it's slippery. Oh! Now we go this way. Let's rest for a while. We still got a ways further to walk. It's hot out here. Sure is. Well, this place is a little spooky. People don't come out here much anymore. My Uncle Hebon used to take me out here when I was little. Where? What the hell's out here? There's a farm at the end with a big house. Nobody lives there anymore. No, thanks. Not yet. - Roy. - Nope. Fine, more for myself. Let's walk. This is what I wanted to show you. It's a plantation house. My dad told me about this place. He saw it one time when he was huntin'. I didn't know there was ever any plantation out here. The Kennicutts owned it. They were kin to some of the people that owned our farm, where you live, Nathan. The place is supposed to be haunted. My Uncle Heben says he saw it in a book about Louisiana ghosts. The last full-blood Kennicutt who lived there got killed by one of his slaves. And they cut off his head. Legend has it he still walks around the place looking for it. My uncle Heben told me that every family's that lived there since has had a tragedy. It's been happening for over 30 years. Roy, it sounds like you're tellin' ghost stories again. This is true. I say we go get a closer look. That figures. Let's go upstairs first. VOICE: [Whispers] You awake, Nathan? BURKE: What is that? RAND Y: What's that down there? That's blood, ain't it? RO Y: It looks like it. What's that smell? It's sulfur. How do you know? They said the Devil used to smell like sulfur. Oh, that's real funny. Shit! What is that? Did you see that? Yeah. BURKE: I don't see anything. Shut up! - He's there. - Where? Do you see him? BURKE: Nathan's full of shit, man. There's nothing out there. Be quiet! No, man! He's trying to scare us! Sonofabitch! Give me the flashlight! No, I'll hold on to it! Come on, Randy. Let's see what's up there. Come on. That sure scared the shit out of me. Did you really see something? My uncle told me he saw a ghost here one time. You think that's what we saw? I don't know. But if it is a ghost, I bet it's that old man. If someone cut my head off, I'd want it back. There's more ghosts than that. How do you know? I don't. It just... It just feels like there's all kind of ghosts. Are you trying to scare me now? No. But this place does feel like there's people in it. Don't you think so? I don't know. Have you ever been to a place where it feels like you've been there before? No. You feel like you've been here before? Not quite. More like I'll never leave. VOICE: Nathan. What is it? Nothing. I thought I heard something. It's probably the guys. Do you remember what we did when you were a little boy? What is it? What's wrong? What do you see? I thought I saw somebody. Don't look. I don't know what it is you see, but don't look anymore. What are you doing? So, this is what you guys do? Get the hell out of here! - You see that, Randy? - Yeah. Looks like Roy sucks dick pretty good. Jesus, Roy. You do that to him? Get away! VOICE: Nathan. I saw you. Roy had your dick in his mouth when he was in front of you on his knees. Do you suck his cock? He wasn't doing that. It wasn't like that. Yes, he was. [Muffled screaming] Do you like me doing it? You ain't goin' nowhere. [Groaning in pain] RAND Y: Jesus. Jesus. He's dead, ain't he? Go catch up with Burke. You think it happened like Burke said? I don't trust nothin' Burke said. Go on, now. [Sniffles] [Sobbing] [Indistinct chatter on police radio] He's over here, Mr. Davis. PREACHER ROBERTS: "...dwell with them, and they will be His people. And He will be their God. And God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes, and there shall be no more death, neither sorrow, nor crime, neither shall there be anymore pain for the former things are passed away. And He that sat upon the throne said, 'Behold, I make all things new."' [Engine turns over] [Sniffles] Nathan!
