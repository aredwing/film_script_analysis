I got mid-field seats. You just can't say no. Right. Can't say no. Meantime, this place explodes. Another Chernobyl. I was here at 11. Go pick up your check. Hi, Mrs. Bordoni here. I'm leaving for work. I was worried. Did my husband... That you? I was worried sick. It's almost 8. What is it, hon? I open the gate, the car stops. He waves me over, I come over. Frank, I got a 9 o'clock wax. He says, "How was the game?" So we're talking soccer. Then he slips it in. "So, friend..." "So, friend" what? What? I got an hour on the subway. I'm off nights. Oh, that's great! We'll sleep together again, like before. - When do you start? - Start what? You're on days. Same pay? Maybe a bit less. Don't sweat it. Times like these, long as you got a job.

My wife's an actress, so she's a whore?! That it, you cocksuckers? I got a little photo problem, too. I know she fucks around. I don't need pictures! I warned you. No fucking around. I see his point. Your clients get no press, they die. Her last movie, we saw her ass. Two months ago, she did a cover for People, Elle, Time! We've seen her house, her pool, her dogs. We've seen it all. Counselor, that is pertinent. What's the problem? Abortion is legal. Plus, she looks fabulous. So tell her abortion is publicity, too. Don't bust my chops with Lady Di. People still buy my magazine.

Attack on freedom of the press. How about your kid's birthday? You think you're hot shit. Red hot shit. It's tiresome. What would you do to this R.R. Guy? The man wants to know who took this. It cost him his job. - And you have debts? - Yeah, I'm building a house. What would you do to him? Beat him senseless. If he was two heads taller? Go for his balls. He can't have 4. Why all the questions? You the guy? No way. Help him out. It's a human tragedy. You came to the right guy. He'll help you. What's this? Neighbor called. Wants 1,000 F. Got my address? Up here.

It's not me, it's for a magazine! Plus he's stupid! This guy's a paparazzi? See my puss? See my puss? I see a photo in a magazine, you got my puss in your face! Got that? Let's get out of here. Have a nice day. You, too. That was Frank. You hung up? I said you were out. Let him stew. Stew? But I don't want him to. Easy. You're almost down to the bone. I'm sorry, Mrs. Lefvre. He can't admit he was fired. What he say? He's on a business trip with his boss. See what I mean? He can't tell me. It's not his fault, he's just too nice. Last time, he was cook in a camp. Food was so good, the kids overate. And at the garage... You're no wife, you're his mother. So you're not a couple. That could prevent orgasm. Hey, I have orgasms. I never have. What's it like? It's weird. Like you're going to die. Want some gnocchi? It's cold. Roman or potatoe? - Semolina. - Roman. - Michel in today? - Couldn't say. With him it's anyone's guess. He owes me 1,000 F.

Plan B: Find R.R. Michel owes me that much. R.R. Is nobody. It means "Rights Reserved." It's on all of them. They're too chicken to sign. Rights reserved? Awesome. Michel's the biggest wuss around. And he got you twice. Sue them, you can't lose. Take their money, they got plenty. I'm not a beggar, I'm unemployed. They cost me my job, they owe me a job! I'll never see Michel again. Cell phone number? Don't have one, I'm unemployed. Call me later at work. I'll ask around. Anybody here? Nobody. Two TV has-beens, and the usual bimbos who think they're Cindy Crawford. - Not late. - Half hour. Right. Compared to usual, you're on time. Renaud Le Bihan, Michel Verdier. I know you.

Then I guess I can have... some tiramisu. And a Perrier. You treat people like dummies. They know it's hype. They want truth. I go after it, and I find it. The best job there is. Yeah, who? Ten minutes ago? Be right there. Sorry, got to go. High journalism calls? Coming? Got a job. I'm going to help him. Coming, Tonto? Not sure. Last time wasn't so hot. All right, stay.

He was right to worry. Worried about me. About how I'd do without him. He said, "Watch out. "With me, you're free. Without me, you're alone." He forgot, I'm here. You're not alone. He didn't forget. You're everywhere, but not here. Who's that for? Me? He was my anchor. Our anchor. We're about adultery, not a love affair. Hey, let him watch. Stop! Same voice as your owner!

Guy wants to beat you up. Me? Why? Cause you're a slimy scumbag. Dirt. A piece of shit. Isn't that right? Michel, I swear. It wasn't me. I said hands off. What is this mess? You taught me. Look what I found. They're yours. I could use them. But I won't. They're yours. Stop the dog. Might be some important stuff. Stop, doggy. Look at you. I know your life. Scrounge around, lie all the time, lose your wife. Shit on everyone, get treated like shit. Anything else on her? You got more dirt? What? Want some more? Here. The bathroom. Here's my schedule. It's all there. Concerts, hotels. Dinner with Benjamin. Number of the restaurant. Thursday's dentist. We're platonic. He might be, you know... Look into it. Coming, Caramel? Wait, Sandra! - I came with the dog. - I'm not stupid! Only you knew where I was. Tell him to be more discreet. I spotted him at the hotel. She's lying! I'm telling you, it wasn't me. Where's the fag dentist? It's Alien, I got to break the eggs. She got it wrong. I wasn't there, I swear. - Anything else on her? - No, I swear. What else? You know me. - You want money? - Hey, come on. That's 40,000. You know me. I sold your El Kabouli pix. Could've screwed you, I didn't. I'm warning you. You hurt her, I hurt you real bad. Don't worry, I got it covered. Sue us cause she's with him? She should sue for those sorry tits! For a model, that's malpractice. Robert, I got a problem for the Bartok shot. The shot? It's coming out Monday. Unless you get the Pope in a pool with Madonna, that's the cover. It's a story in pictures. I love you, I love you not. It's a top series. So what's wrong? I don't want Verdier to know I took them. Anyone asks, it was R.R. R. R? Yeah. R.R. Sandra, it's Kruger. I pled your hearing today. They won't recall it, but we get a 50,000 F indemnity and the usual legal statement on the cover. I think we did pretty well. Mrs. Bartok, it's Gisle. Disaster. The stain spread. It's blackberry or red currant. The jacket's ruined. I'm sorry. Come by the shop, we'll work it out. It's Benjamin. Sorry you found out that way. It really sucks. I'm sorry. It's Michel. Fuck! I know. Look, I left 4 or 5 messages. She doesn't answer. Could you go, Charlotte? Keep me posted. I got to go. Where'd he say he was? Rome. That's Rome. It's your job to screw up other people's lives. I'm doing this to save his. I wish someone had done it for me. He's 15 years ahead. That's not fair. Years I was a prick, I never got hit. I decide to change. I'm honest 2 hours, I get slapped. No, it's not fair! Right, it's not fair. One slap isn't enough. Hello. - Three? - Right. Three. I just found out, too. Cognac, please. Tell her we were 3? Evelyne Bordoni. Your name? Bndicte. Well now, she is very pretty. My heavens. And long! Legs, all that... And the... What a piece. Must be great in bed. You never know. Some hot babes can't fuck. And some homemakers got the Cleopatra grip. Stop it. - Your wife? - Yeah, but... So let her talk. If you're happy, if you love him, I won't stand in the way. I won't cloy, I'm not the type. You're a real jerk. Sorry, I wasn't told. Won't be my last slap. I'm a paparazzi. Goes with the money. It's my life. I'm a hunter. I'm no civil servant, 9 - 5. The prey's in the woods at 5 a.m. You make enemies. I'll have plenty. Yes. Me. Since the money, you give nothing else. So choose. Paparazzi, or your family. Be right there. Get in. I'll drive you. Where? Hospital. At the morgue, for 5,000, Didier'll open the drawer. Safari shots OK? Good for National Geographic. Little tit, some pubies. Can't a guy kid around, Nicole? Shit! ...No, I lost my parking ticket. See you in a half hour. I love you, darling. Lost my ticket. How are you? Got a minute? Come in. How's it hanging, man? Working here? Yeah. You? I'm at Magma. Nature Dept. Jungle, birds... Nicole and I got married. Great. Sandra OK? Saw the baby pictures. Yours? Not mine, no. But she's fine. It's weird, we haven't spoken much. Evelyne? Had another boy. Right, not really yours. Not at all mine. Had him with another guy. But you're OK? I found my groove, my element. You happy? Very, yes. Take a look. Cameras all over. Every floor is filmed. Jeez. It's her. You never stopped? I'm a parking attendant. For the day. Sorry, lost my ticket. That's not good. I'll let it go, for you. Thank you. Could I just say one thing? We really like what you do. If only everyone were as nice as you. Don't lose her! Stay on her tail! I just drop you off. - Who's arguing? - So it's clear. She gets out, I drop you, I go. - No problem. - No problem. What you using? - Opens to what? - 35 - 56 With this light, use the 200. Opens to 1.8, you stop it up 2. No. - Yeah. - Not 2. - Yeah, 3. - Practically. Feels like airport. Ergo, crowds. Ergo, depth of field. Use the 200, you're cool. You're the pro. Do what the fuck you want. No, I hear you. What kind of film? Kodak. I'm real Kodak. Me, too. I'm Kodak myself. See? We agree.
