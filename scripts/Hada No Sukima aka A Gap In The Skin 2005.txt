We are going. No I won't go anywhere. Let me go. Something like this has happened before. When I was little. But I forgot where I wanted to go. It really hurts. From abroad. That's it. I wanted to go abroad. It was fun. But then suddenly I became afraid. So I ran off. And I returned back home by myself Yukiko went to get you. Auntie. After that she wouldn't let me go out. Is it okay if I don't die? I am afraid. I am very much afraid. What should I do? I want to go back. I am afraid.. You're not going back. You are not going back to Yukiko. Alright I'll go with you. What are you doing? No, don't! It's embarrassing. Auntie. It's okay I'll put this here. Neighbours reportedly saw two people on a motor scooter... From the time of the incident... It's been so unbearably hot. And in other news... Today in Tokyo at the Ueno Zoo a panda gave birth to a cub. My husband, you know... due to a liver condition he has been admitted to a hospital in serious condition. He will have to have an operation. This will cost money. Ah, yes... It didn't bloom this year... the cherry tree. Long ago the one that your father planted. That tree. It did not bloom. Mother What... have you done? Mother I need money. Taeko Tell me what have you done to Yukiko? What have you done? What have you done to Yukiko? It would have been better if you had been the one to die. It would have been better if you had never been born. I beg of you. Return to my womb. What's the matter with you? Is this your way of getting back at me? It was my first time to see her. Auntie It might have been best to tell her the truth. I... stabbed my mother. Ice cream! Do you have ice cream? There's bread over there. Go ahead and help yourself. No need to be polite. I bought too much. Doing this kind of work. I never know when I can have a break. So I wound up buying a whole lot. So go ahead and eat. No need to hold back. So you want to go to the nearest train station? As a matter of fact... that's still quite some way to go. Where do you want to go? Just the train station I guess. We're going abroad. Eh? What did you say? A-a-abroad? That's, uh, the name of the place? It's really been hot lately hasn't it? Well whatever. Nothing around here, is there? Ah, it's okay if I smoke? Do you smoke? Smoke? Here you are. I got a light. No, no, you light the other end I'll light it. That's right. Got it? Is that your wife? Don't be ridiculous. She's a hitchhiker. - Really? - Really. What is she doing in a place like this? Whatever it is, she hasn't told me. Doesn't seem like it's just a trip. - She really looks nice. - What do you mean? She's looking for some guy to pick her up. Don't say such a crazy thing. I'm just taking her to the train station. Ridiculous! Don't you have work to do? We need to get moving The windows. Clean the windows. Sorry about that. - Today I'll have some ramen. - Okay That's too much. Then 50 pesos. Okay According to a witness report the sister of the victim, unemployed Taeko Hirai and the victim's son, high school student... whereabouts are unknown and are being sought for questioning. - Here you are. - Thanks. This feels great! This is fun. This what we do when it's hot. Be careful. Careful, careful. It's okay It's okay. It's okay Hold on good. It's okay. Don't be afraid. It's okay It's okay I won't do anything. It's okay. Be careful. It's nothing. Be careful. Be careful. Where are we going? I don't want to be here with a woman. Let's go back. Where are we going? - We are going. - Where? Going abroad. What are you saying? There's no way to do that. You saw it, didn't you? When my mother died... Don't you remember? You were there, weren't you? You saw it all, didn't you? Where are we? Why am I here? You're just pretending that you don't know. Actually you know everything. Stop Take a look at this I caught it myself. Auntie What's wrong? I'm going to wash up. Did we forget to lock up? Having only tomatoes? Here take this. I'm going back to the bath. Look at this. It happened when I left that house. Really something isn't it? When I went out from the window. That's when I scraped my hand. What? What? What are you doing? It can't be helped, can it? They don't catch me. And you won't kill me. For killing someone... It can't be helped. It can't be helped. It can't be helped can it? It can't... It can't be helped can it? It can't be helped. Auntie I'm in pain. It can't be helped. I cut myself. No one understands me. This really hurts. Give me some space. I can really feel it. My mother... I really did it. I... I... It's your fault. Help me I can't say anymore. I can't do anything for myself. You are also tired of this. It's all finished. I can't do anything. It hurts. We're going. We're going. Stop it. Let go of me. It hurts. Are we really going? Are we getting anywhere? We're finished. No, we're not. It's useless. We're going. Grab hold. It's useless. I don't want to go to a hospital. We won't. We won't go there. My child. We will go on. We really will. Going abroad. Eat? You don't need to eat. You don't eat. Stop Don't Stop What day is today? Angry? Yukiko It's the day Yukiko died. Hidenori? Are you going to die? I won't die. Absolutely not die. She is dead but I will not die. I won't die. So painful
