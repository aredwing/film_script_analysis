Out you go. You couldn't do me a favor, could you? Please, I've been searching for months. His name is Frank Barron. It's important. Let's have a look. Watch yourself on that glass. Oh, yeah. Took him off to Fairview. Had to call the police. He put up a hell of a fight. - Fairview? What's that? - Hospital. Pass it on the way into town. What do you want with him? He's my dad. - Hello? - Hi, it's me. Did I wake you? - What time is it? - I found him! - Are you serious? - Yeah. - I'm going to see him tomorrow. - Oh my God. I know. Soon everything's going to be all right. I'll be back soon. All right, bye. Frank? You have arrived at our destination. You have arrived to... Yeah, I'm here to see Dr. Burrows. Fairview is a secure unit for patients with severe mental difficulties. including Alzheimer's, what we think your father has. He was sectioned under the Mental Health Act Various acts of aggression have been reported, which is why he was brought to us for assessment. - How bad is he? - He may remember you. But his memory comes and goes; I don't want to raise your hopes. Most of the time he's in his own world, when you leas expect it, he sparks back into life. But the disease makes him paranoid and prone to hallucinations. I understand how hard that can be. "Frank Barron". We've only ever know him as Frank, of course. He's not the first to arrive here without I.D. Somehow people slip below the radar. It's not uncommon, sadly. I'm surprised you managed to find us. Yes, it wasn't easy. I've looked for him for months. We weren't close. I knew he grew up around here... What sort of person was he? You're talking about him like he's dead. I'm sorry. This must be very hard, but... our Frank, the one we've been looking after, he's not the person you knew. You must understand that it's no Frank, it's the disease. It can be easier to think of him as a different person. A stranger even. Maybe you should see for yourself. Frank, for goodness sake. I can't hear myself think! That's better, isn't it? Bit of light makes all the difference. I wish I was dead. - What's that? - I wish I was dead. Come on, Frank. You've got a special visitor. Can you see who it is, Frank? Your son has to come to visit you. It's James. - My Jamie. - That's right. Yeah. I'll leave you to yourselves. I'm just outside if you need me. Right. Thank you, thanks. How you doing? You okay? Everything all right? - Where am I? - Hospital. - Accident? - Not exactly. - Where's my fags? - Fags? I don't know. Look, dad, you might have a look at this? - Can you remember anyone? - Cathy. - Cathy. That's right. - My wife. - Yea, you're right. Mum. - Mummy. Your mummy. Right. Well done. You want your tape player? Okay, I'll get you some music. Here we go. I'll put it on. It's all right, its off. It's off. Hey! Stop! Stop! Stop it! Frank! Frank! Frank. Frank! Frank, it's okay. It's okay. Jesus. - I thought it went well. - I'm so sorry. It's the medication. They've switched it so many times, I don't know who the real Frank is. Look, I tried my best. What do you want me to do? Bust him out? I don't know what to say. He's sick. Yeah, really sick. What I'm saying, it's like... Alzheimer's or something. - Morning. - All right. Sorry, they're not gonna let me bring him back. They just won't. Don't be like that. I did. Because I can't! I'll see what I can do, all right? Yeah, I will figure something. We'll give you a cup of tea. Don't be afraid. I don't want tea! I'm not a criminal! I know. It's all right. Let's go back inside. He's been much better since lunch. Hello, darling.

It's stopped. This is the new start. We've talked about this. I've done this for you, I did it for Luke. I just want you to be happy. I just want us to be happy, yeah? - Yeah. - You deserve it. You're beautiful. Hey! Who are you? Oh, hey! Don't touch him! Give him to me! Give him to me! - Stay away or else I'll... - Give him to me! - Stay away! - Don't fucking touch me! Don't you touch him! Dad, wait! Leave him! - He's my boy! He's my boy! - I'm gonna call the police! - Don't call the police, Sophie! - Stuart, who is he? - Stuart, who is he? - I'll tell you. Stu... - Who's Stuart? - What's going on? - All right, it's me, James. - I want my boy. I'm your boy. It's James. Look at me. Look at me. - It's me, James. - Jamie. It's me. - Right. Dad. - Yeah. Yeah. Dad. You're my Dad. - Your Dad. - Yeah, you're my Dad. I wanna go home. It's okay. I'll take you home. Stuart? We're fucked. I know. He wasn't supposed to be in hospital, - so I had to get him out. - Of course they did! It's called kidnapping, Stu. Why would they take the risk? - I had no choice. - There's always a choice! Yeah, not with them! You got no idea. I had to do something so I said I was his son. - You fucking idiot. - I didn't know what else to do. It was his word against mine and he don't remember a thing! Maybe we should call the police. What? I can't just give him up to them. God knows what they'll do to him. Do to him? Jesus Christ, look what they did to us! If they want him so badly, they can have him. Look, they're probably gonna kill him. - Can you live with that? - Rather him than us. What do you want me to say? We are where we are. I just want to do the right thing, that's all. It's too late for that now. - Stuart? - What... What you talking about? My name's not Stuart. Fuck! - Dad! - Who are you? No more lies. - Tell me the fucking truth. - I'm not your son! All right? I'm not your son. I'm not your fucking son! - Who are you, you cunt? - Nobody, all right? Nobody. I was just told to come and bring you back. Back where? Back to your home. - Who? - I don't know. - I don't know his name. - How fucking much? Not enough. Not enough, believe me. I'll tell them you escaped, all right? And I'll take you back to the hospital. - No. - Well, then what? I just want to go home. That's not a good idea. I just... want to remember. But you won't now, will you? You won't. Okay, mate. That's it. Out you get. Go on, out you get. Come on. Take this, all right? There's some money, all right? All right, take that. That's all I've got. Go on. Where? I don't know where, Frank, all right? Just find someone and ask him for help. They'll take you to the police. Promise me you'll ask for help. You look after yourself. That's it. Go on. Go on. Hello, Frank. What are you doing there on your own? Come with me to the car. Come on, mate. Let's get in the car. Come on. This way, Frank. This way, this way. Come on. This way. We're gonna stay here, Frank. Okay? Hello, mate, just wondered if you had a spare room. - Filthy habit. - Yeah. I wish I knew how much you understand. I wish I knew how much you remember. Cause I need a reason, Frank. I need a good reason why I shouldn't just hand you over. I'm scared, Frank. I've got... - myself in a bit of trouble. - Oh. Yeah, I owe some money. Lots of money. And they're gonna hurt my family. And my son. My fucking son! Please, I just need a good reason. I need to know if you understand something. You understand, don't you? Don't worry, Jamie. Daddy will take care of you. Who are you, Frank? Who are you? Who is this freak? Who is that man? Who's that man? Tell me. - It's Cathy. - Yeah, Cathy. - My wife. - Yeah, your wife. Is this about her, Frank? Is it about her? Fuck. Hello? No, you listen to me. I can't do this. Yeah, well, I wish I could, but I can't, mate. No, I'm not doing a thing until you tell me exactly what you're gonna do to him. Well, fuck you! You do not threaten me! I'll call you when I'm ready. Oh, fuck. Well done, son. I'm proud of you. She's killing it. - You wanna try and do that? - Yeah. Yeah? - Where's my fags? - You can't smoke in here. Fuck 'em. Okay. This is for you, Cathy. It's your favorite. # Forever, my darling # My love will be true # Always and forever # I'll love just you # But promise me, darling # Your love in return # Make this fire of my soul # Forever burn # My heart's at your command, dear # To keep, love and to hold # Making you happy's my desire, dear # Keeping you is my goal # I'll love you forever # For the rest of my days Me too. # I'll never part from you # And your loving ways Beautiful. Are you crying, Dad? Don't tell me you're fucking crying! Don't spoil it. - Why you lie, daft sob? - No. I mean it. Where's my fags? - Where's my fags? - You lost them again? What she said? "Where's my fags? " "Where's my fags?" Leave me alone, will you? You'd forget your head if it wasn't screwed on. Fucking leave me alone. All right. You can dish it out, but you can't take it, can you? - What? - Please, leave me be. All right, don't be like that. Give us a kiss. He, cheer up. Oi, oi, leave off! Don't start that one, mate. Excuse me, can I get a vodka tonic? - Good Lord, I'm thirsty. - Are you? - What do you want? - Vodka tonic. Can I get another one of these? - Lisa, by the way. - Sorry, Stuart. - Oh, bless. - He's good, isn't he? Yeah. Is that your dad? No, no. He's a good mate. So he won't mind if you and me go somewhere else? No, wait, wait. Sorry, love, I'm married. - I don't mind. - Well, my wife might. Actually, you know? You might be able to help me out. Slow down, mate. You all right, Frank? What's the matter? - I don't... - What's the matter? - I just... I just can't... - It's all right. - Too young to lose your mind, huh? - Don't, James! - Used to being like that. - I'm all right. - Yeah, you are. - Yeah. - Yeah. - Hey, it's your birthday, right? Let's get a picture. Can you get a picture? Smile for the camera. - Fuck, what's your problem? - You're my fucking problem. - Let's go home. - No, no, just calm down. - I don't fucking know you! - Frank, we're gonna go. - "Mom", "Mom". - Don't fucking touch her! - I'll chop your head off! - Frank! What the hell do you think you're playing?! - I'm sorry. Are you all right? - You need fucking help, mate! What the fuck's wrong with him? You idiot! - It's not what you think, Jamie. - What you put up with that for? - He's the same! - Cath, come on, let's go. - You don't understand! - Don't go! Don't go with him, Mom! Just stay here with me! Fuck! Come on, Frank. That's enough of that. Watch your step, watch your step. Did well, Frank. You did really well. How'd you enjoy that? There you go. Go on. Here you go. I've got a surprise for you. I think someone very special wants to see you. Be nice, wouldn't it? - Wanna sit on the bed? - Yeah. Come on, we've done this. Just bend your knee. Come on, let's tidy you up. Get you looking nice. Hey, all right. All right. - Handsome man, Frank. - Of course. Yeah, of course. Of course you are. A bit of music. Frank, you wanna take one of your pills? - Come on, it'll do you good. - No. It'll make you feel better. You want to be right... for when your special visitor comes, don't you? All right. All right. Yeah, come in. Come in, come in. Listen, thanks so much for doing it. I'll give you that now... and the rest when I get back. Yeah, all right. - This might sound a bit weird. - Trust me, it won't. Can you tell him your name is Cathy? - Okay. - Yeah? All right. Is there something wrong with him? No, no, he's fine. He just needs a bit of looking after. I'll just go out about. Yeah, need a bit of a babysitter. Who's this then? Frank... Look who it is, hey? It's Cathy! Hello. Cath? Yeah. That's right. Go on, you'll be all right. Jesus, Cath. I missed you so much. You'll be okay. All right, I'm ready to talk. It's okay. You're okay. You feel a little down? Yeah? Yeah. Come on, that's it. There you go. That's nice. Good. I thought I'd lost you. - I get so confused. - It's all right. You're all right. Sit down. You look nervous, Stuart. If you lay a finger on me or my family, I sweat to God you'll never see Frank again. Don't you worry about them. Just worry about yourself. Come on, please. I done what you said. - We had a deal. - I know, and I kept it. I said I'd find him, that's all. - I didn't agree to anything else. - That's not up to you, Stuart. You owe me. - What you gonna do to him? - That's none of your business. Where is he? I don't know what the story is. All right? I don't know how much he owes you, but it's not worth it. He hasn't got anything! He's just a sick old man! - I don't care. - He doesn't even know who he is! I went into the hospital and I told him I was his son! He totally believed me. It's like he's a little kid. - You can tell him anything. - I never told you to do that. All I'm saying is, whatever you gonna do to him, he don't deserve it. You've got it all figured out, haven't you, Stuart? Look at your little brain working away there. You haven't got a fucking clue! You'll never leave me, will you, Cath? - You're hurting me. - Say you'll never leave. Poor old Frank. Did you feel sorry for him? Did he make you cry? You don't know Frank. Stop it. For God's sake, Frank, what have you done? Get off me. Get off me! - Who are you? - It's me! - What the fuck is wrong with you? - Stop it. You're not my Cath. I don't care who he was. He's not the same person. You can't punish him - for something he don't remember. - I'll make him remember. Some things you don't forget. What's wrong with you? Coming to bed, Frank? For Christ sake, Frank! what have you done? - Who are you? - You'll burn the house down! - I don't know you. - Not now, you gotta help me! - What you doing in my Dad's house? - It's me, Cathy! You're not my Cathy! Stop it! - I don't know you! - Frank! You gotta help me! Now, what you gonna do? You gonna kill him? You'd be doing him a favor. Believe me, that's what he wants. You think you know Frank. You have no idea what he did. - I don't know you! - It's me, Cathy! - Help me! - I don't know you! Of course you do! Not now! Help me! Who are you? You're out of your depth, Stuart. Just take me to him, please. I'm not gonna do it, mate. - What the fuck do you want? - Fuck off! I won't do it! Get out of my way! Who are you? It's me, Cathy, remember? Frank. You're hurting me. You're hurting me. What have I done? I'm sorry! I'm gonna go now, okay? It was me! It was me! - You gonna be all right? - I'm sorry! Look, please, Cath! Forgive me, please! Don't go, please. Don't go. Don't go. Please, don't go. Please, don't. Please! Forgive me! Why are you doing this? He's nothing to you! Frank? Frank, are you okay? What's got into you? Frank, come on, get up. What are you doing on the floor? Get up. Come on, we got to go. Frank! Come on, get up. We got to go. We're leaving now, all right? Come on. Now what you've done? What the fuck have you done? No, no. What have you done? What have you fucking done? - No. - Wake up! Frank, wake up, mate! You don't! Come on, wake up! Fuck! I'm gonna phone the hospital. I'll phone the hospital. You'll be all right, okay? - Fuck, fuck! - Jamie, don't. Please, don't. Let me sleep. I just want to sleep. You should go, son. Leave me. Frank, what have you done that for? Come on, hey? - It's for the best. - Yeah, for the best. - Yeah. - Yeah, for the best. - I'll just fall asleep. - Yeah, sleep, all right. You need to sleep. You go to sleep. All right, Frank? Go to sleep. Okay, Frank, get some sleep. I want a drink. - You want a drink? - Yeah. All right. Here it comes. Here it comes. All right, okay, okay. It's okay. I love you, son. All right, Frank. Lovely, Dad, lovely. You don't mind, do you? It's just a camera. Yeah, police? You miss me, Jamie? I miss you. Every single day. I'm proud of you, kid. That's him. He's my Dad. SUBTITLED BY GUSSI, SA. DE C.V.
