But it's the one from yesterday. I'm looking for a job. Oh I don't even know what's the date. It's Thursday. Have a look at this. Ah, not bad. And that? It's an eye! You're smart. Oh, I see. And that? It's the other one. And this? It's an ugly nose. No, no, no. You have a beautiful nose. Oh it's not very gracious. The voice, it is, but the nose... Well, i gotta go now. Bye, Mister. Good-bye. You're hard on me. You're even harder... ...than a baseball ball, a baseball ball. [pun: "base" sounds like "fuck" in french] Let me tell you something: you're loosing lucidity for a minute and you're busted. Gimme a break. You're drunk. Yeah, busted, wasted. You'll lose all the chicks. It's cristallisation... ...like Stendhal says. You're no fun both of you. Always the same tricks! Hey, shut up! If you want us to help you, you have to seat quietly! As if i needed your help! That's why i say, you can't seduce without lucidity. Or else, girls will bleed you to the latest drop. Only one scheme, switch! Switch can be exchange. Yeah, a good baseball party... ...a good baseball party! I'm playing it alone. Okay man, as you want. Have you been in London lately? Yeah, i brought back this. Oh, freedom. Another beer? Two. - Three. - Four. I'll get it for you. You know her? Are you interested? We can get you launched on it... How's your work? Well, I have to find a name for a new bubble-gum. Baby-gum, Baby-gum. Baby gum, ain't it good? Oh we'll see, I'll find something anyway. For the moment we have to think about having some fun! It's, it's gum. I call it a baseball party... Okay, that's enough. Let's get moving. You're hard on me. It's been quite too long. Your little baseball game. I wish i wouldn't be here. I don't know where's that elsewhere besides. A new life, new horizon. Find something else. But the problem is i don't really know what. Leave far away from here, where everything's grey. I don't know where's that elsewhere besides. Anyway, somewhere else than here where i can't even afford to be bored... ...that lethal, terrific boredom. Ah, boredom, boredom. A no man's land between life & death. Dying two hours and a half... ...without moving, without thinking. boredom... ...neither happy, nor unhappy... ...motionless! A fantastic void where every possibilities fall asleep... ...one by one. Oh, it ought to be possible... ...this end-of-the-world concept. A precise point under the sun. Precisely under the sun... ...extraordinary. Not bad, not bad at all. Not bad, not bad at all. Amazing. Ah, i need to go see by myself. Not bad, not bad at all. Not bad, not bad at all. Grey eyes. Green eyes. Tomorrow, i'll know the exact color! Not bad, not bad at all. Not bad... ...not bad at all. Yeah, this chick's mine, man. Already. Huh-huh. Not bad. What do you mean "not bad"? Hey man! Are you kidding? She's terrific. Who's that, there? - Where? - There. I dunno. What do you mean? I dunno. She happened to be there, passing by. Okay, anyway, you've gotta find her. - Why? - No why! But... Fool! C'mon, hurry up! Let's get it on. Oh... Ho! What did you do just before? Oh, nothing. I was wandering. And you, are you here for a long time? Eternity! THe boss's looking good. Young... ...friendly... Really? I didn't notice that. Okay, so, i want her look to be seen on every Paris' streets. Apprehend young women, young girls... Search the roofs... ...find her, and bring her back to me, alive. And make it fast! Monday, 01:00 PM. All my thoughts are for her. It's my fault. Anyway, it's only a matter of hours. With eyes like these, you have to be blind not to find her. What if she was with someone else? No, impossible. No, she wouldn't do that to me. Ouch. My heart is achy, already. I'm busted. Love at first sight, ain't it. Stupid! It's really unnecessary. Why me? I was made for fellow-feeling... ...love on the wheels... ...lies cured in car... ...bevelled card decks... ...antipathies & sympathies. I was made for these. I was made for fellow-feeling... ...possibly bunch of friends. I was made for that... ...not for love. I was made for quick affairs... ...possibly a bunch of it. I was made for these... ...not for love bonds. But what is a couple good for? It's already complex in a threesome. If we could move in with ...everything would be simplier, so much more natural. I was made to live with several people... ...possibly alone. I was made for that... ...not for a twosome. I was made for that... ...not for a twosome. I was made for that... ...not for a twosome. Now, it's all over. I have to count on her. A dangerous game. Not easy one. Ah, I'm not cut for that job. I'm not ready for everything, and with this one, anything goes! Capable of everything... ...whatever mistakes. First of all, learn who she is, and don't think too much. It's useless. So, we'll see. Thursday, 01:00 AM... ...still nothing. I should use another method maybe? Posters, and now what? Radio isn't convenient. Police? No, not yet. Friday, 11:00 PM. Or else, just let the fortune do it. I met her on a snapshot. I'll find her again this way. Friday, 04:00 PM. Nothing... ...but it's been a lot of fun. - I'm crazy! - Sure. - Crazy about her! - Sure. - I can't live without her! - Sure. Better to seek the whole planet, I want her back! Sure. What's he doing? So, are we go out? No, I don't want to. I'm reading my letters. Hurry up! Ok, where are you leading me? At your place. Leave me, I'm going back. Is she kissing him? She kissed him. What else? A caption? What should I write in it? Mr. Lopold, what's inside of the caption? She's kissing him. How do you spell that? M, c, h? C, c, h? M, s, c, h? No? C'mon, man, don't be square. You're no fun! Anyway, I don't like that girl. She's acting foolishly. With a blurred gaze, fuzzy stare, whatever. How can she be so dumb! Move. A precise point under the tropic... ...Capricorn's one or Cancer's one. I forgot which one. Under the sun, precisely. Not nearby, not close. Under the sun, precisely... ...precisely underneath. In which country, which district? It was nearby the sea. I forgot which one. Under the sun, precisely. Not nearby, not close. Under the sun, precisely... ...precisely underneath. Was New-Mexico? Towards Cape Horn, towards Cap-Vert? Was it an archipelago? Under the sun, precisely. Not nearby, not close. Under the sun, precisely... ...precisely underneath. It must have been a erotic dream... ...with wide open eyes. What if it was real. Under the sun, precisely. Not nearby, not close. Under the sun, precisely... ...precisely underneath. Tomorrow, I'll come back here... ...under rhe sun. The sea will take me away... ...til he comes back. It will be great. But at the right time, i'm right here, and that's it... And we cope with everything, Right Anna? I gotta go, i can't count on them. At least I would have drunk my first non-alcooholic drink! - Didn't you notice something? - I Did. So did I. The kid became weird. Weird, that's a bit too much! But he's absolutely nuts. I've been told that he fell in love. With someone. A celebrity? Much worse, a chick. This one? No, that one. Are you trying to tell me that he wants to date a poster? He doesn't date, Marianne. If he doesn't, it means he doesn't care, Anne-Marie. No, he loves her. But he doesn't know her. He fell in love with a snapshot. Ah, poor guy. At his age, it's quite normal that he's aroused by the mysteries of life. Nevertheless, a relationship with a picture, that will make people gossip. Besides, it's very unhealthy. What about her family, anyway. No idea. We have one photography, not the whole album. Listen to me, Marianne. Tell me, Anne-Marie. We have to find a bride for this kid. A bride? Good idea! We don't even need to ask him. We do, we should tell him. He can't get married without even know about it. He'll discover something, later or sooner. That's it. Just find him a wife! A young one! Let's have a fancy-dress ball. Yes, let's do it. There must be one among the good-looking ones with who he'll make it out. A wealthy one. A petite... Cute... Blonde enough... Coquette enough... Listen to my heart. It's beating only for you... ...but another you, one I don't know about. Yesterday or tomorrow... ...I would have told you yes. Yesterday or tomorrow, but not today. Yes, I could have been yours... ...but you're not here. I was free like you... ...but I didn't notice that. Yesterday or tomorrow... ...I would have told you yes. Yesterday or tomorrow, but not today. Yesterday is so far away already... ...and I don't love you. Tomorrow, if you thin about me... ...I'll be gone. Yesterday or tomorrow... ...I would have told you yes. Yesterday or tomorrow, but not today. Yesterday or tomorrow, but not today. A day as usual... ...I'm alone with myself. Why Anna, Anna... ...are you staying alone with yourself? A day as usual... ...he'll come to me saying... "I love you Anna, Anna". Taht day, everything'll be changed. Oh, that's enough! He ought to have incredible eyes. To stare at people in the dark. He ought to be adroit. What's so special about her? She doesn't even have legs! That's the trick! What is she doing with her life, that one? Le Crazy Horse, le Milk Bar, They have special girls. Cover girls, oh! Who cares anyway? She belongs to whoever wants her. My conception of love is a trompe-l'oeil. I'm the kind you pin... ...the deadliest vamp. The most dangerous comic-book character! I'm the girl you stick... ...on Harley-Davidsons... ...BMW... heavy-loaded trucks I'm the roller-girl. The roller-girl. I'm the chick from advertisement... ...the Lolita from comics... The most dangerous comic-book character! I'm the roller-girl. I'm a lovely trompe-l'oeil... ...a tatoo-transfer girl... ...immdiate danger and fictitious love. I'm the roller-girl. I'm the only one left alone. Nothing will ever happen to me. If it goes on like this... ...I'm busted. Monday... ...tuesday... ...wednesday, nothing. It's getting harder and harder. What should I do? Sit here and wait for her? Wednesday evening. They all look the same to me here. What am I doing here, am I nuts? What's he doing, Serge? Ah Serge, ah Serge. Come here. Dear Serge, seat down. I have to talk to you. Besides, I must speak to you. Do you understand what it's all abot? No, my aunt. Bring me an absinthe with a sugar, please. Please, bring me a sugar, with an absinthe. Serge, dear, you're an adult. Besides, you're more than 21, my boy, you're a man. Your aunt is right. That's the first time I hear this one. This story of ghost in short skirt is grotesque. You're everyone's fool. What your aunt doesn't dare to say, is that everybody... is making fun of you. It can't goes on like that. - It has to stop. - My boy... ...get married! Or else, I've got another idea. Why don't you wed someone? Oh, my aunt. I just can't. Why not? I don't feel like it. I can't understand these modern yougsters! When you're in love, you must marry someone. On the contrary. When you marry someone, you must be in love with her. You shouldn't marry someone else. Let him be. He prefers to live it up. He'll be the death of us Murderer! I just can't, I cannot. To appeal to the audience? You've got to be kidding! First, at the present time, the french population is having diner. We just can't disturb them. - Anne-Marie, beg him. - No! Sir, our nephew is deseperate We have to find this girl. How old is he, this young man? Ah! Boys of 28 are so sensitives nowadays! Sir, if you help us, we'll give you... many, many... We're searching, take good note, We're searching somebody. No one knows how her body looks like, nor what her name is. So, every person who matches this profil... ...is asked to go at the Publex agency... ...35 Champs-Elyses, Paris. It's a woman, apparently she must be a female... ...according to the police. Ah, a last detail: her age is unknown. - That's all. - Thursday, noon. I'm still alone... ...not for long time though. It's me! It's me! It's me! Eight days ago, I would have appreciated that. I would have brought them back home. Be careful my prince. Hello, I'm coming. Let me see that. No. This is not it. This is not it. This is not what I'm looking for. Ah... Idon't feel so good. Annie? Anna. Anna. Anna, I'm upset. You're not a funny one. It's this transparent woman who's killing you. Anyway, i'll go to your funeral. As soon as there's flowers, I'm happy. That's the way I am! Incurable! Have you heard about it? Oh, with this snapshot girl? He's nuts. It's plain dumbness. But she's looking good, ain't she? Not bad. Are you in love with him? What? Are you out of your mind? Nothing, it's doesn't matter. Forget about it... ...don't get angry. It's just, when you work all day long with a guy... ...sometimes you're imagining things. Well, it's not my style. A bit awkward, uh? Still, I find you funny. VYou must be quite a catch, but you're not aware of it. You have nerve! Oh, you didn't understand! I didn't try to position myself. Do you have someone? Right! Is she pretty? They're very pretty. Oh my, what a bastard! Okay, so long chick! If this is love, why bother? I'd rather never, never. I'd rather never love. One day it's me. The day after, it's someone else. So why, why me... ...rather than someone else? If this is love, why bother? Change always, all the time... ...I'd rather forget about love. Is there something else about sensual life Than a alternative motion... ...between apetite and disgust, and between disgust and apetite... ...between apetite and disgust, and between disgust and apetite. I don't care! Shut up, Let me talk. The floating mind, always unsecure, between ardour who revels itself... ...ardour who renew itself and then slow down... ...ardour who renew itself and then slow down. Gimme a break! But amidst this perpetual motion ...between apetite and disgust, and between disgust and apetite... ...we fool ourselves by the concept of stray... ...freedom. Do you who i'm quoting? - No. Bossuet. Bravo! The Funeral Orations? Oh no! Because I'm cynical enough to make it my course of action. Ah you're disgusting! Disgusting, man. Sure. A little bit of amnesia and look where it's getting you. A violent poison, this is what love is. Something to take carefully. Like in car. Actually it's 190. Bloodshed. Here's a piece of advice, if you care about your life... ...forget it! I'm running after a shadow. And it's not even mine. She'd be on the theater's bill. I could wait for her in front of the stage door. But she's unreachable. Where could I possibly find her? Ah, my little Amstrong Jones, you shouldn't have shot pictures! Oh you're so sickening. There's no way to talk with you. Everythin's a joke for you! Wrong. Terribly wrong. One of these days, you'll see, and you'll get me. Listen. When you'll be fed up... ...I have a chick for you... ...absolutely stupid... ...but so aesthetically pleasing. Okay, don't bother. Bye! With her everything would be possible. Will she even recognize me? Between dream and reality, there's a gap. Yeah, everything's possible. She can find me unbearable. With a girl you know from a picture, you never know. With her everything would be possible. It will be wonderful for me at first. We'll see lesser of each other, if I don't tell him. But then, it will hurt more and more. With him everything would be possible... ...it's never good the first time though. It would surely be not that bad, and then it would get better. And then it would ge worse. What if she finds me unbearable? It would surprise me though. I'd be in sorrow, each day more. As she wouldn't mind my love. With him, it's impossible. Splitting up would be awful the first time. I'd be in sorrow, each day less... ...until I just wouldn't mind. I just need to see her to know. He just need to see me to have me. Hey, it's you? Well I don't know, I guess so. What are you doing here? Same as you, I'm trying to cross the street. This way then. I know, I know, you're the illustrator from the lane 4... ...room 3, table 42. The one who's biting her pencils! First of all, I'm not a illustrator, I'm a colorist. That's what I said. You color drawings & advertisments. Not at all. From monday to thursday, I use blue. From thursday to saturday, I can use red. If I'm not making too much mistakes... ...next year, maybe I'll have the right to use orange, but somone has to pull strings for me. Say, you're still running after your caricature? Why a caricature? You don't even know her. Neither do you. True. I don't know her. Nevertheless, I'm addicted to her. And it's gonna get worse if I meet her! I think... ...it's a good thing to be separated from someone before you get to know that person. It means less pain. Will you end up kill yourself for her? I don't really know. I haven't made up any plan yet. For the moment, I'm nuts and that's a full-time job. You're nuts? That's great! I'm not and it's getting boring. Farewell. Goodbye. So be it. I don't know this place, I've never been there. That's the first symptom, so I've been told. A percussive jam-session. She's behind my eyelids, upside down. I won't say "you", I say "she". She must at least know that I love her! Stupid bitch! I know what's wrong with me: dlirium. I chase you away from my mind... ...I reject you... ...I avoid you, but you come back to me... ...always, you come back to me... ...like a boomerang. It'd be so nice if you could hit me lethally... ...and end my life... ...but no, tou keep coming back... ...like a boomerang. Me, myself and I think that I'm cured... ...my heart no longer beats. I stay until dawn... ...between life and love. Sometimes, I think I'm cured... ...my heart no longer beats. I stay until dawn... ...between life and love. Have mercy on the fool I am... ...Finish me off for good. Go away, yeah, go away... ...don't ever come back like a boomerang. That's the 13th bar I'm in tonight. But I'll find her... ...I'll find her. Y'know... ...looking for a girl in the bars, it makes you kind a thirsty. What time is it? In six secondes, it'll be 4:00 AM. Hey, don't make fun of me! Sorry, Sir. I'm gonna break up. It will be quiet, no shouting, no crying. I'll remain cold, icy, english-style. She'll clutch to me... ...She'll cry, she'll weep, but I won't even look at her, oh no. Because I, I'm more worthy than her. She must be a foreigner. How could you know since you don't even know her? The eyes... ...like circumflex accents. Oh, c'mon. The hallucination trick, I'm not buying it! Do you think I'm some sort of dumb-ass? Do you? She exaggerates, she thinks I'm a dumb-ass. Yes, Sir! It ain't right! It ain't right! Stay still, only way here to move. Or else I'll crumble! I'm killing myself! Look what she has done to me! See what's left? Thank you! Thank you so much! What is she doing for god's sake! She's here, she's not here. It's not possible, not possible! Not possible. And yet, as I'm closing my eyes, she's here. Don't say anything, no need to. Don't say anything, follow me. Ne dis rien. N'aie pas peur... ...ne crains rien de moi. Suis-moi jusqu'au bout de la nuit... ...jusqu'au bout de ma folie. Laisse le temps... oublie demain... oublie tout, ne pense plus rien. Don't say anything, no need to. Don't say anything, follow me. Don't say anything, don't be afraid... ...have no fear. Follow me till the bottom of the night... ...till the bottom of my madness. Let time be... forget about tomorrow... forget everything, don't think about anything. Follow me till the bottom of the night... ...till the bottom of my madness. Let time be... forget about tomorrow... forget everything, don't think about anything. Did he take his pink pills? Pistolet Joe sleeps with one eye open... the other one is always open. Pistolet Joe sleeps with one eye open... ...the other one is made out of glass. Pistolet Joe. Oh... Pistolet Joe. Pistolet Joe was striking me... but one day he was betraying me. Pistolet Joe, it serves you right... the bullet that blinded you half. G.I. Joe, you're gonna die under stars & stripes. G.I. Joe, all the rockets will get your american ass. How many stars on this flag? One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. How many stars on this hero? Seven, six, five, four, three, two, one, zero! It's my fault, I've loved her, I'm the one who killed her! G.I. Joe, Wonder-Woman for the american hero. G.I. Joe, you're gonna die under stars & stripes. How many stars on this flag? One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. How many stars on this hero? Seven, six, five, four, three, two, one, zero! How was it already? That's the tune I've loved so much. A precise point under the tropic. All this stuff looks so far... ...so far... ...so far, so far, so far... Unreachable. A vanishing point. On the seashore. Laying down on the sand... ...under the sun, precisely under the sun. I must have gone crazy... ...It was merely a dream. - Look at that cutie, look! - Yeah, she's not bad! Ah, so here's the awaited picture for the end of the year. Look at your face on this one! Wow, look at you, you look nice there. - Hey, wait a moment. Who's that? - Look. It's me. No, not you. What? Gimme a break! What's the trouble? Leave him be. Say, Paul, where is she? Who? Her. Answer me! I don't know. She can't to this to me, it's not possible. Qhe can't leave me that way. You could have told me it was you! I was looking for you! What's he doing now? I must seek her, for sure. I should have tried to tell him. Maybe she tried to tell me something. But I was insane, looking for the other. For her, actually. And I got it so wrong. What a fool! What a fool I've been! She was so close to me. I didn't manage to hold her up. All I want is to tell him... ..."I love you". Thus, maybe... ...who knows?
