Being verified and signed by the appropriate Authority... in the name of His Majesty Fernando I am calling the... names of those who will be executed by means of garrote. Francisco Martn Puro, from Osuna. Antonio Gmez Charanga, from Torre Milano. Diego Rodrguez Villarasa, from Lucena. Francisco and Juan Snchez, from Alpujarras de Granada. Manuel Expsito, from Esparragal. And Aurelio Torremocha, from Carcabuey. For robbery in desolated areas, committing murder, and other crimes against society. The execution order will be issued today, at noon. It has also been decided that Francisco Martn Puro's corpse... who was the group's ringleader, be placed in various public roads... in this and other villages, as a warning to others. There were rumors about Aurelio being pardoned, as he fought against the French... but he was the first one taken to the gallows, and he died like all the others. Diego was crying like a woman. When the priest arrived, he asked for confession. But not Francisco. He didn't even want to look. Then they went straight to Francisco Without even removing the ring around his neck, they bled him with a knife. The bystanders weren't leaving. The removed the ring from Francisco's neck, and afterwards they dragged him. Don't say another word about this. Not now, not ever! One-eyed, go to the entrance and see if you have been followed. I haven't been followed. Everybody remained there, watching how Francisco's body was undressed. They won't even leave the robe on his body when his remains are placed on the roads. That's how the King rewards the people who fought the French. People like you and I, Lutos. That's how he pays us. Shut up if you don't want to end like they did. What shall we do? You are the one who must decide, Lutos. We'll be heading South. Anything but staying here and becoming trapped like rabbits. Antonio! You will relieve One-Eyed. No problem. But first I'll have a nap. Freeze! Stop where you are! What are you doing here? Is El Lero with you? Sotillo... Who is El Lero? You must know better than I do. He is a bandit. And you? Who are you? He is alone. Jos Mara Hinojosa Rodrguez. A friend told me to ask on his behalf for El Lero. I need to find him. Are you a fugitive? That's my business. Answer! What happened to you? I killed a man. Why?... And where? Because of a woman... during Jauja's festivities. Which Saint Patron's festivities do they celebrate in Jauja? San Miguel. Who is the local master? Don Anselmo del Pozo. He runs the Medina family's affairs. The family resides in Cordoba. What were you doing in Jauja? Did you work on the vineyard? There are only holm oaks and chestnuts in Jauja. The vineyard is higher up, close to the mountains... far away from the village. Whoa! (Song) By a fruitless tree... it came to my mind... how few friends has how few friends has... anyone who has nothing to give. Oh, by a fruitless tree it came to my mind... I would like to know where are you taking us now. We just left a few hours ago and you are already grumbling. I'm trying to take you to a safer place! If anyone disagrees, speak up... now! We are going to the inn in El Alto. It's the best time to catch them by surprise. We'll spend the night over there, and we'll return to the mountains at dawn. Do you think we could use the same horses by dawn? They will have horses at the inn. And if they don't have any? If they don't have any, we will wait for ours to rest, then we will head for the mountains at noon or whenever they are rested. That is... if we manage to do it. I'm leaving. I will find El Lero and join him. You won't go anywhere, Jimnez. And be very careful with what you do! It may sound strange, but it is the first time I come this way. We've noticed. I mean no offence, but in the Royal Court they have no clue of what's going on in this area. It seems the Liberals have rebelled. They don't like the King, and the King does not like them, either. And is your Mistress involved in those politics? This roast makes one forget all the worries. My Mistress is not involved in those politics. She is loyal to the King. She is traveling to visit her estate. She inherited it many years ago, but she has never been here before. Her land is about one day from here. That's great, not even knowing what you own. You have been lucky, for the last execution has cleaned the roads. Until a few weeks ago, no carriage would pass... without being robbed and someone being killed. They caught seven, and all seven were garroted. That's what happened. C'mon, I knew one of them when he was a kid. His father was Villarasa's verger, and the boy was a great kid. He was so good, he almost became a priest. Take my word. Gentlemen, don't you eat the whole roast. Leave something for the Authority. It was quite a colorful event. It was well arranged and very exciting. Obviously, you haven't been in Madrid. Your Mistress is very beautiful, very white. I never saw a woman like her before. In Madrid, if you have money, they will make you beautiful. And she is white because she is not exposed to the sun. It's like if you spent a few weeks in the cellar. If you lock her in the cellar, she will come out white. But if you lock me in, I will come out drunk as a skunk. Don't you hear that someone is calling, Vicente? I'm going, woman. I'm going. Keep eating, gentlemen. All is fine. - Hail purest Mary. - Conceived without sin. Brother, could you give me shelter for tonight? Bon apptit, gentlemen. I come from Carcabuey's Fair. My horse is tired. If possible, I would like to stay here overnight. I thought I wouldn't find the inn. I've been scared, believe me. What do people say about the execution? Not much. That, apparently, they didn't bury the ringleader. Someone named Paco Martn Yes, sir, that's the case. They have exposed his body to be an example to others. Freeze! Nobody moves! Hands up! All against the wall! Nobody moves! Sotillo, go to the cellar. - Antonio, take those two with you. - Let's go! Jos Mara, take their valuables. Jimnez, look in the stables. Is there someone upstairs? Just a Lady who comes from the Royal Court. She is the only one who may have something valuable. We are all poor. There is nothing here. Don't you touch her! What do you want? Leave my room immediately. Whoa! Here. We must find El Lero, wherever he may be. Anything but risking our lives and provoking the Authorities this way. I've been risking my life for many years, and I'm not afraid of doing it. Neither am I, Antonio. But not that way. You won't go too far with a tired horse. If a real man has something to say, he must speak loud so that he can be heard! The only thing I have to say is that I am leaving! I will try to find El Lero, or anyone else. Anything but remaining under your command! We won't split the loot until tomorrow. And if someone is afraid to be in my group, we'll talk about it tomorrow! I'm not afraid to be part of your group... but there are things a man should never do. Where are you going? In this group, everyone pays for one person's mistakes. Don't you forget that. Whoa! Whoa! C'mon, wake up. - C'mon! - Leave him, Antonio. I told you to leave him! He asked for it. Wait a minute, Lutos. I'm going to kill you. - Sotillo, Gypsy! - Freeze! - Stop it! - Let go of me! Let go of me! - Let go of me! - Stop it, Lutos. You all will pay for this, I swear! Now! Let's go, Antonio! Nobody knows if he still will be alive tomorrow. Let's go! I will stay here. As you wish. We will be in the Dog's Ravine. Quickly, let's go! Look Sotillo, what I have found. This fire can be seen from far away. Let's leave this place. I would like to do the same thing to all the cortijos in Andalusia. We should be leaving, Sotillo. We won't leave until the fire is out. Will this heal him? Let him rest for a few days. He must not move. He is strong, and he will be well soon. May the Cross spare us from evil. May the Cross spare us from evil. Where are we, Antonio? A friend will let you stay here for a few days. It seems that the worst is already over. Where are the other men? We'll join them when we can. El Sotillo is awaiting us. One day I will be able to repay you for this, Antonio. Who is Mara? The old woman said you must not move! What do you know about Mara? You have been mentioning her name during the whole night. They have killed One-Eyed. This is for the wine. What are you looking for, Father? These men need my assistance. I'm afraid you got the wrong information. These men are dead. But then...? Father! Confession! I want to confess! Confess me, Father! Confess me! - Let go of that! - Stop! Stand up! - Stop, Sotillo! - Let go of me! That's enough! From now on, I am in command! There are two more men in the inn. Antonio and I will take care of them. Let's go! Corporal! Sergeant! Freeze! Don't move! Don't move! - Gypsy! - What? Go inside! Inside! Inside, quickly! Halt! Halt! At your orders, Lieutenant. I have orders to escort the Mail carriage to Cabra. You may return to Blmez My men will relieve yours. Yes, Sir. Anything else, Sir? That's all, thank you. One of you, go to the coachman's seat. It's Antonio! Come and let's talk, old pal. Here is El Sotillo, as well. What are you doing here? He is now our boss. By the way, he came to the mountains looking for you... and now he is our leader. Hey, Montes, bring us some wine. Since I went to Cordoba, I keep hearing about all of you. An inn, a mail carriage... too many things for so few men. You said you came to the mountains looking for me? I ran into some trouble in the village. Then I went to La Zalema and Juan Zebrin told me look for you. What happened to El Lutos? He died. Same as Jimnez. An One-Eyed as well. Yeah, what a massacre. El Lutos was looking for trouble. Well, what do you all want from me? You are just a few. Mind you, a few good friends are worth much more than a larger group with no unity. We came here looking for a few men. We have something to offer in exchange. You are starting to stand out quickly. Too quickly to boss and put on airs the way you are doing. And I thought that El Lutos was no longer an animal... Don't be in a hurry. We'll talk later. He deserves to be in charge, Lero. He is quite smart... cold blood, he is brave, and we don't risk much... What's your name? Jos Mara Hinojosa. Here you have him. A man who has just arrived and he is already teaching us. Jos Mara... El Tempranillo. The one who came to the mountains asking for El Lero. What's bad of this kind of life is that you don't get any better times. You are always one step from being shot or having a knife stuck in your guts. Of course, if they catch you they treat you like a wild dog. They put you on a deck, and they stick a screw through your neck. Think very well about it. You can still change your mind. Don't trust any of these men, not even me. Today we are friends, but tomorrow we may be enemies. And don't get involved in politics. Treat the peasants well... they must either respect you or fear you. They are on their own, and they like us to be in the mountains, I don't know why. I no longer have any hopes, like you do. You are still young and you have many years ahead. But I wasn't born to be a starving peasant with no land of my own. When nobody knows who is the heir, I will buy some land nearby Granada. And people will address me as 'Don Juan'. That's better than nothing. - Good morning, gentlemen. - Good morning. Could you tell me if Mara Jernima Frances is working in this area? Yes, sir. She is reaping in the wheat fields. Thanks a lot. (Song) Your affection is like the bull... who goes wherever he is called. And I, like the lone tree, And I, like the lone tree... which does not give shade to anyone; which does not give shade to anyone... just to me, between the wolves. It breaks my heart... whenever I think of you, Mara. When I have you in front of me; when I have you in front of me I forget all the bad things, I forget all the bad things, and I must forgive you. Not by shooting me or by stabbing me... have I pulled away from your affection. I will not leave you, I will not leave you.. even If I must loose, even if I must loose the eyes with which I look at you. Mara, wait. My mother told me that you left the village without saying where you were going. I have looked for you all this time. I come to make my word good, Mara. I told you I would come for you. Didn't your mother tell you the beatings I got because of you? Didn't you mother tell you of the many sleepless nights... I waited for you at your home? Didn't they tell you that I have starved? I have been slowly forgetting about you. It has been a long time. Don't let her run away! Get her! Mara! Gentlemen, let's have fun. You too. There will be peace today... and nobody will hurt you! I want a sensational wedding, not a funeral! I'll pay for everything. Let them eat and drink! Tell the villagers, Sotillo! You are all lucky. Long live the bride! Long live the couple! She is going to be yours, for my advice was futile. Long live Jos Mara! The whole village is yours if you so wish, Mara. Long live Jos Mara! Where are the owners of all this? They are in the cellar, don't worry. Thank everybody in my name for this gift. Antonio! We will depart in half an hour! Everybody get ready! Get my horse ready! - You've heard it. C'mon. - Get up, Castro! Hurry up! You can't leave me now. I want to go with you to the mountains, or wherever you may go. C'mon, give me the sash. I won't be a hassle. A married woman must be with her husband. Mara, during the last few days I have thought of everything. I must do many things that came to my mind. You will go with your aunt Rosario to a village where you can be safe. And I will go and visit whenever I can. Niceto! What do you want? I am a friend of Paco Morales. He told me that you and I could reach an understanding. About what? Whenever a stagecoach comes, you will send a man to us. If the stagecoach is escorted, the man will wear a hat. Otherwise, he won't wear anything on his head. He will go towards the Mountain of the Jaras. He will stay for exactly two hours at the bottom of the mountain. My men will guard the roads day and night. I want every stagecoach paying its toll for passing through my land. Within two weeks my men will charge every carriage what we have agreed. That's all, gentlemen. Let the Royal Stagecoach Company and... everyone else know about this. And sorry for making you wake up so early. You may all go now. Ah, one more thing! You tell the Authorities that Jos Mara dislikes killing anyone. - Did you understand? - Yes, Sir. - And you? - Yes, Sir. OK, go back home. Stagecoaches and Mail Coaches will pay for going through my land. The mills and the cortijos will also pay for our protection. All the police force of Andalusia will come after you. That's why I am talking with you. If you do the same thing I do, but far away, the police forces will have to split. You probably have thought which region is the most convenient for you. Look, Lero, I am thankful to you. You have been good to me. If you accept, we will control all this land without risking anything. And the profit will be larger. We will control the whole Andalusia. I am tired, Jos Mara. I'm not saying you are not right but I just want to live in peace. I just want to retire and buy a cortijo near Granada. This is not for me. I can do it on my own. My offer is because I know I can trust you. Think about it. I've already thought about it. I won't change my ways. Sorry for not reaching an agreement with you. Well, we have nothing more to talk about. I'm leaving. Think about it, man. Think about it. Discuss it with your men. It's better for them. Look... leave to me the provinces of Cordoba, Malaga and Seville. And I'll have the rest of Andalusia. Poor villages, beggars' roads,... No. I'm OK the way I am. - Let's leave all this. - OK. We'll leave it. I cannot accept. But Lero, what do you want? The whole province of Malaga, 1/4 of what you collect from the Royal Stagecoach Company and the right to protect the cortijos and mills north of Seville. - Whoa! - May I see your papers? - Sorry, Father, but it's my duty... - You are just doing your job... - And, may I ask why all these precautions? A Liberal has escaped from the chain gang. Looks like he is a dangerous man. Hmmm... you will no doubt find him. It's not easy to outwit the law. Be with God, my son. Father, what do you want? I have prayed daily for your return. Since you don't come here often, you are not up to date of what's going on. And I don't intend to tell you. Mara... You come from the mountains like... you came from a prayer. It's up to you... Let's see... what were you going to tell me? Holiest Mother of God! Mara! What are you doing? Don't you recognize me, Rosario? May all Saints deny you bread and peace, for you are desecrating God's name. What a shame, Holiest Virgin. What a shame. I'm going to have a baby, Jos Mara. If things keep going well, I'll leave the mountains very soon. I'll buy a good cortijo and we'll both enjoy life with our new child. My son will not be a starving peasant. You cannot imagine how lonely I feel at night. Call it a quit now, Jos Mara. Leave it. It's not good to wish for more than what you have. I want to live with you. I want to be at your side, like now. You will have to wait until I finish my new venture. Only animals live like you and I do! Husband and wife must sleep in the same bed!... Did you hear me? You are married to Jos Mara 'El Tempranillo'. Take care of yourself, Mara. Death is my travel mate... Death is my travel mate... Giddy up! Death is my travel mate... Giddy up! Who are you? Speak! My name is Pedro Snchez. I am a fugitive of a chain gang. I will face a firing squad if they catch me. Me too, son. Come here. Sit in the back. All the stagecoaches have paid this month. If things keep going so well, King Fernando will increase the bounty on your head. Hey, you Englishman! How much longer to finish that painting? Show a more proud appearance. Eeh! More proud! This one only paints portraits of very important people. But remember he hasn't made one of the King, yet. Antonio, you can start distributing the loot! You, give me some watermelon! Hey! Hey, you! Go get your pay! Let's get our pay! - Come. - Hey, Cal, it's payday! The mail coaches have requested a special price to go through Despeaperros. They say it's a public service and... Write this down, Pedro! I, Jos Mara 'El Tempranillo' have decided that... mail wagons are to pay the same as the stagecoaches. Write it, then you can sign it as well. - Satos... - Yes... - Campos. - I'm on my way. - Baena. - Here I am. - 100. Juan Pedro... 200. - Romero. - Yes. - 200. Let's see if you like this. I, Jos Mara 'El Tempranillo', am informing King Fernando VII that both official stagecoaches and all carriages engaged in public service will pay the already agreed toll whenever they pass through Despeaperros. The King is hereby warned that, should he reject these conditions, he will be facing frequent disruptions in the aforesaid services. Good. We haven't done anything wrong. What do you want from us? You have no right to abuse two poor women! - Tell that old woman to shut up! - Just obey and shut up, old woman! What do you want? Mara Jernima Frances? Let's go! - You have no right...! - Keep going! - Hey, you, keep going! - You have no right... Stop there! Was that necessary? Bring the woman here. Give that to me..! That piece of baggage too! We'll now see what's in here. Are you Mara Natalia Figueroa, Marquese of Los Cerros? I have a message for you. What happened? He says do not despair, he will free you soon. If you can, tell him I am well. Tell him not to take any risks. It's not worth it. The Gypsy will be my deputy. He will live in my same house, and so will they. They will be with you when you give birth. Juana is the best midwife in this area. I will come whenever I can. I am assuring you that nothing will happen now. You are now in the mountains. It's OK, Mara. It's OK. Everything will be alright. I'll be by your side. The moment I hear the news, I'll come here. Take care of yourself, Jos Mara. Be careful. Commander Ramos... you will go directly to Cdiz with the bulk of the troops. You, Santos, will go to Seville. And you, to Crdoba. We must prevent the Liberals from grouping together. At your orders. First Squadron... march! Second Squadron... march! Cheer up! Keep on going, don't stop! Halt! We'll stop here... Haaaaalt! Pedro... That's a Liberal party. I am Pedro Snchez. I was captured with Alvaro Villar and the other comrades. I managed to escape in our way to the prison in Seville. I have heard of you. I am Capt. Leoncio Valds, at the service of the Constitution. This is my friend Jos Mara Hinojosa. Sir... What is the current situation, Captain? There is general discontent. Spain will be ours. We will implement the Constitution. In a week, at the most, I will have recruited 500 men in Crdoba and Jan. We will defeat the Army, and we will join all other forces to enter in Madrid. I suppose, Captain, that you are well informed about... how important are the Royal troops. I am well informed, but the soldiers' morale is equally important. Don't you forget that we are fighting for a just cause. And, if it comes to that, we will die for that cause. If I can be of assistance, feel free to use these lands... which are mine! There were about 1000 men in the column I saw. The stagecoaches are escorted by 20-30 soldiers. The coachmen are also military personnel. They are guarding day and night the cortijos, the mills and the villages. Your people on the plains are awaiting your decision. The Army didn't just come to crush the Liberal uprising. The King will seize the opportunity to get rid of you. They won't come into the mountains. And what for do you want the mountain? Your business are also elsewhere. They are also in the plains. They will trash your whole organization. - Pedro is right! - My decision prevails! I will stay away from these politics! Lucas, go to El Lero's territory! Tell him to remain in the mountains and not to move! Jos Mara, you cannot stay out of what's going on in Spain. I will! I am not interested in this infighting! Gypsy, go and tell Jos Mara that the childbirth will likely take place tonight! And you, bring hot water! Stop! We are at your service. Juana! Rafael! Juana! Juana! Mara. Mara. Mara! No! The baby was a stillborn. Carlos! Don't leave me. Don't leave me alone. Take me out of here. Jos Mara Hinojosa! In the name of the King, surrender! No... Jos Mara Hinojosa! In the name of the King, surrender! To the horses! Don't let him escape! - Don't let him reach the mountains! - Let's go after him!... Fire! The men are restless. El Lero... he accepted the Royal pardon. And so did his men... Jos Mara... You must do something El Lero is a coward. Troops, march! You are making a mistake going in the open. Please, give it a second thought. The troops you were expecting did not arrive. Join our group! We will do guerrilla warfare, as we already did before against the French. The peasants are with Jos Mara, and they will join us. I don't like your plan. If the men we were expecting don't arrive, I will go and find them. You will lead these men to death. But they will die for freedom! With honor! These are just words. Do you think so? Discuss it with your men! If someone wants to fight against the King, he will be with me, not with you! The whole Spain is with us! We will march on Madrid! Long live the Constitution! Maaaaarch! Charge, soldiers! Captain, our squadron is going after the rebels. The Royalists are coming to the mountains! The Royalists are coming to the mountains! Pedro! Bring my horse! Get all the men ready! Give me my horse! Let's go! Not in the mountains! I rule here! Charge! Pedro, let's go after them! Let's help our friends! Keep going! Don't leave anyone alive! Kill all of them! Kill all of them! Go ahead! Eh, Antonio! Don't leave anyone alive! Pull from the rope! Let go!... That's enough! Jos Mara! You are now like El Lutos. Hello, Antonio. Jos Mara, this man asked me to bring him here. Listen to him. Jos Mara Hinojosa? That's me. I'll be brief. I am offering to you the King's pardon. His pardon also covers your men. This gentleman is a Notary Public. If we reach an agreement, he will write down... the names and places of birth of all your men. The King wants peace, so he is offering you amnesty and... a sum of money varying between 500 and 1000 reals so that all of you can start a new life. What will I get? A cortijo in the Province of Crdoba. And a sum of 25.000 reals. And all this is in exchange of what? I will tell the conditions to the person concerned. Only the deal with Jos Mara Hinojosa will have strings attached. It's a good price, Jos Mara. It's all over, Jos Mara. Think of your men as well. They will go back to the farms, and they will be people again. Give up now, when they still fear you. This way, we will end our days like any decent citizen. What are the terms? You will hunt after any of your men who returns to the mountains. This is the only string attached to this pardon. They are offering us a chance to change our lives! And they are asking nothing in exchange! I think we should take what they are offering us. And what is the King giving you? He is buying you for a few reals, and he will keep ruling without caring for his people. Me must keep on fighting! We will start again! We still rule in the mountains! You don't want the same thing as they do, Pedro. Leave them alone. You and your men will be pardoned. Those were the General's words. I will stay here, in the mountains with anyone who wants to join me. I'm going with you... Pedro is right. I will have to hunt you, Pedro! And you too, Sotillo, if they tell me to do it! This the price I have to pay for the pardon. In that case, we'll see each other again. Let's go. You cannot refuse. Those men were part of your gang. You must honor your part of the deal. How many men do I count with? Come in, Antonio. Take a seat. He is my right-hand man. Twenty soldiers will be enough. They are fewer than that. By the way, Pedro Snchez has little to do with you. He is a Liberal politician, and there is a bounty on his head. Pedro Snchez was second in command in my group. The men will be ready by dawn. If you are successful in this mission, I can tell you that the King will reward you. (Song) I don't care if a King blames me... if the people are great and they vouch for me... people's voice, Heaven's voice... people's voice, Heaven's voice... There is no bad King, it's just the actions I don't care if a King blames me, if the people are great and they vouch for me. Let me do it, Antonio. Let's go. Antonio... take care of my affairs. Let's go! What has he done to you to take him this way? We, the peasants, are always paying for all! What did you do to them, son? What have us peasants done to be taken prisoners? Don't bother us! Get out of the way, now! Squadron... march! Let's go! Do you think we are getting close to them? We are going the right way. Why are we not seeing them? This is a vast area, Sir. - Pedro! - Let's go! (Shouting) (song) Shepherds, you who take care of the livestock Come here soon, don't delay. For Jos Mara has died. And the people don't see him anymore. Glory to Jos Mara, Glory! El Tempranillo has died. And the people are weeping. El Tempranillo has died. And the people are weeping. He was killed by a treacherous shot. He is looking at History in the eye. He is fallen on his horse. Glory to Jos Mara, Glory!
