I'm glad. Don't cut off the whole fatness. Leave a bit of it with the meat, it makes the taste better. Today the best of us can get work in here. So... Maybe we'll start the exam. So, who's going to be first? No volunteers? Maybe miss... Rybacka will show us how to cut off a fillet. Please. Your future is in your hands. So maybe miss Hania will show us? Please. Wait a minute, please. She'll do it. - Come on. You need this job. - I hate this. - You learned it and that's how you'll earn your living. - Get lost! You're neither rich nor pretty so you'd better go to work, OK? If there's someone as sensitive as miss Rybacka in here, I suggest to go home. Who's next? Yes? I'll do this. Go on, please. Here you are. A boneless pork loin. Mariola, you got the job! You got the job, it's awesome! Do you like it? Stop it. Yes, darling. I said: stop it. To guys. No. To new life. Why are you looking at me like that? - Whose health are you drinking to? - I don't know... - I wish I'd a good job and an apartment and... - Come on, say your wish! - Guys like you, you're pretty, but me... - Your things'll shape up good too. - Yeah? I'll get old. - You'll get a job in another slaughterhouse... It's all written somewhere. You'll marry a guy and give him a child... Then you'll get old... fat... Your skin will sag... And your stinky husband will exchange your tits for a bottle, these'll be the best days of your life! Hanka! Are you crazy? Ola... - To our future! - Fuck it! Yeah, fuck it. Hi... This is Artur. - Aleksandra Rybacka... - Artur Balt Don't you recognize Artur? A skinny stammerer, two years older. You were in love with him! Skinny, is that you?! I-I-I haven't seen you for years! Where have you been? Hanka, don't fool around. I went to Germany with my parents and graduated from school. You haven't changed much. It's for you. A present. - Awesome, isn't it? - You look like a TV star! - Do you like it? - Yeah. I'll take it on the trip. Are you going on a trip? Mariola didn't tell you? - You hide something from us? - No... We want to go on a short vacation. Maybe we'll visit my parents in Cologne and then at the seaside, huh? Lucky one! To the seaside! To us! To the meeting. Wait, grandma! - Girls, can I come in? - Come in! It's midnight, for God's sake! Could you be quiet? - Fine, grandma. - Didn't you invite any boys? Hush! It's time to sleep. - It's time to sleep. - Goodnight. Goodnight... We won't let you out until you tell us, what you were doing all those years! Grandma! - What?! - Could you switch it off? You overdid with it a bit yesterday. Could the Old Witch be a bit more kind to me? Drink it. The Old Witch has to tidy up after her Princess. When will my girl start the job? The girl doesn't know it yet. Maybe she'll go on a short vacation first. Why it that? You got a job and you want to go on vacation? Come on... I know what I'm doing. But with whom do you want to go? With some boys, huh? Grandma, I can take care of myself. And I know what I want. And what do you want, darling? Dear Witch... I want to be happy. - Hello. - Hello. I haven't seen you for a long time. I'm sorry, but I didn't want anything from you, Father. Hey, hussy! They sell you in metres or kilograms? Get lost, you can't afford me. You bi... Fuck! Do you know who you are talking to?! - Didn't you hear what this lady said? - I was just kidding! - Drop dead! - You have to be careful. I am. - Hey, wait! - Come on! Stand there, I'll take a photo of you. - Smile! - I'm smiling. - Grin! - I am grinning! OK. - Do you remember this? - What? Skinny, skinny... - So what's with our trip? - Did you make your mind? - I did, and you? - A long time ago. - It's my dad. - Say hello to him. Hi, dad. We've a little delay. We'll be there tomorrow in the evening. Don't worry. Bye. - My dad says hello. - Thanks. You think he'll like me? Of course he will. He's looking forward to meet you. - Are we going tomorrow? - Maybe tonight? - Don't tease me. - Are you ashamed? - No, I'm not. - That's my grandma. - Come on, I'll introduce myself. - No way, she won't recognize you. - Come on! Grandma! - Do you remember Artur? - Hello. Hello. You're grown up now! You look exactly like your father. Mariola, stand by your grandma, I'll take a photo of you. I'll show it to my father. So you're going tonight? - Is Hania going too? - Yes. The whole lot. - Is Artur going too? - Yes. Your mother... trusted guys too much. Take it, my child. Take it! You'll make use of it. You're such a dear. Dear Grandma Dear Grandma. I'm sorry I didn't say it outright, but I left with Artur. It's very important for me, so I hope you will understand. I will be back in three weeks. Your Princess Hey. - Is that all? - It's all I need. Listen. If you want to speak German, do it right! Do you always talk to your father in German? - What do you mean? - You talked in German on the phone. When my father went to Germany in 1989, he stopped using Polish. I had to learn German. Hey, you! Do you like me? You're splendid. So maybe we'll stay here for the night? I'm sorry, but I'd like to on the spot. Let's go, OK? Passports, please. And miss? Is she Russian? - Is everything OK? - Yes, it is. We're in Berlin. In a half of an hour. See you. Darling, we'll stay here for the night, OK? It's 600 km to Cologne and I'm sleepy. At last! Come on. - Don't you think it's a bit late for a visit? - I told them we'd come. - Hello, Nadenka. - Hello, Artur. Come in, please. - My name is Nadenka. What's your name? - My name is Mariola. I'm sorry for the mess. I've no time for cleaning because of the child. Please. Sit down, please. - How are things? - As usual, a lot of work. Is this the new beauty? - Good, isn't she? - I made coffee. I'll lay down the baby. Who is she? - She's my friend's wife. - We shouldn't disturb her, let's go. Chill put, I know it's not nice in here. - She's got very strange eyes. - It's not easy to be an emigrant, huh? Coffee? Sugar? I'd like some. Thank you. It will be OK. I know the road is long. What is she saying? She says you've a long road before you. - Hello, Gunter! - Hello, my friend. This is Mariola. How was your trip? First time in Berlin? I don't speak German. English a bit. My name is Gunter. Welcome to Berlin. Excuse me, miss. Excuse me, business. Your mate is touching me, tell him something! Don't worry, he's a bit loony. - Let's get out of here, please! - Don't be hysterical, these are nice people. - This is her grandmother, she lives in Piotrkow... - What are you doing?! - And this is her passport. - You son of a bitch! Shh... Her name is Mariola Szymanska. Show me what she's got. Good? A bit small, but the ass is great. Your name is Justine, you understand? Now you belong to me. You've got too much money. You'll work for me. You'll get the money back and it'll be over. You'll be a whore now. What a temperament! - So thank you gentlemen, good night and have fun! - You bastard! Jurij, the bedroom. In business every second counts. I'll sell it on the Internet. Film it. If you break her, she'll work for you. Don't hit me, please... I'm your friend. Don't be afraid. - Niko, are you OK? - Yeah. You must help me. You have to scream! Scream! - Is everything OK? - Yeah. Mariola, you have to be strong. You won't escape from here. They're dangerous to your family. I can't help you. Nadenka! Help! Does anybody hear me? People, help! Can you hear me? Dear Grandma. I wish I'd hug you. I regret every moment I didn't spend with you. Forgive me if we don't see each other again. Don't worry. I love you very much. Your Mariola Justine? Where are you? No! You wanna take a bath? What are you doing, you idiot?! She's had enough! Don't tell me what to do! Stop it, now! This cunt irritates me. Maybe I'll sell her to Oman. - There's another way out! - Oman is the way out. He needs three weeks. I need just two. Give me a chance. You have ten days. No longer. For my sweet Justine. - If I break her, she's mine! - I'll give you ten percent. My name is Niko. You are a good man. Help me. I'll help you if you help me. Free me. You have to free yourself. Do what they want you to and you'll be free. Do you understand? GOD, HELP ME Now you must eat. Look, I eat. Mmmm, very good. Now you. You are alone. We have to work together, do you understand? Good. Come on. Niko will take care of you. A little princess in her castle... is waiting for the birds to fly off. Now listen to me, you have to work! We have only seven days left. Your grandma is in danger. If they sell you to Oman, you're fucked up. Come on, I'll show you something. Now, look at you. What a beautiful girl. Look. Your name is Justine. The beautiful Justine. Young skin, nice tits. Many men will like you. Don't be afraid, Justine. Get dressed. And? Let me go home. You stupid, I want to help you! You're a good person. Fuck you. Do you want a pretty doll? Have it then. Do you like me? It doesn't look good. Free me. I'm not a good man! You'll have to change. I want you to look beautiful. Do you understand? Now, what do you think? My name is Mariola. I come from Poland. What's your name? Where are you from? My name is Mariola, I come from Poland. I come from Poland... Poland... A little princess in her castle... I want to be happy... I know what I want... I left with Artur... A dream looms under the eyelids... To new life. SURRENDER Which one do you like? None. This one? Do you like it? Look, in this job you have to look good. It's not so bad. The men are bad, but the job is good. You are like them. I'm your sister. I'm on your side. We are in this together. Now you understand. I'm hungry. And I want to drink vodka. OK. Look. Healthy food. No fat, no bad cholesterol. Taste it. Let's celebrate. - Cheers. - Cheers. To our cooperation. Hey, sister. Let's play together. Now it's your turn. It's enough. You couldn't sleep? If you need something, sister, just ask me! Problems with communication? Wanna go dancing? If you try to escape, your grandma will be dead. If you say 'yes' and work for me, you'll be free. Do you understand? I hate violence. I'm giving you a choice, think about it. You look pretty. I don't mean to disturb you, but my mate asked me for help. What do you want? Your grandma may be worried, because she haven't heard from you. Write a nice letter to her. Fuck off. OK. Look. We know when your grandma leaves the house, to which shop she goes. We know everything. Write. Write the fucking letter! Niko's a bit nervous. You don't want your grandma to get hurt, do you? It would be terrible. Dear Grandma, it's wonderful in here. I found a very good job in Cologne, so I'll stay here a little longer. Maybe I'll manage to come to Poland for Christmas. Your Mariolcia Good. Thank you. Hey, darling. You're gorgeous. I'm delighted. My name is Justine. Get undressed and prepare yourself. For this money you've got only 15 minutes. I changed my decision. Take your clothes and fuck off. Have you made a decision? - Are you in the apartment? - Yes, I am. - You've only two days left. - I know. OK, bye. Hello, boy. Do you like me? I work for you. Not for them. Good girl. We are one: Mariola and Justine. You don't have to do this. Don't be afraid. Lesson 1. Not much kissing. Take the money first. Provoke a fast erection. Time is money. Don't forget about the condom. Like this. What are you doing? You'll like it. Scream. You have to scream. Never get orgasm. What after? Next lesson. You have to trust me. A guy may want to kidnap you, so I take care of your safety. I set the rules. Your nails have to be clean and polished. The body perfectly washed with soap. Sexy dress, neat make-up, red lipstick, but not too much. You look better in the blong wig. Lashes painted, perfect scent on your body, and the most important thing - moisturizing cream. - Hello, Niko, my friend. - What are you doing here? - Surprise. Give me Justine. - But I have two days left! It's too late. I sold her. - What about my job? - Thank you for it. Show us her. We made a deal! Hello. My name is Justine. I work with Niko. We will pay you. Deal? You look great. But now you have a new daddy. Do you like dogs? We're in this together. Try me. Move back! And be quiet! Come, Mariola! - Give me the gun. - Shut up! Give me the keys! - That's how you thank me? - Shut up. I counted on you. You won't survive long. Keys to the house! Jurij. Take it, go! You're dead, Niko. Artur, your Pole escaped with Niko. Find them and bring to me! Fuck, shit! - We fucked them! - Shut up! We are free. Get out! Go away! You're fucking free, that's what you wanted, huh? You can't stay with me, we're dead! I told you to fuck off! And what about grandma? Who protects her? It's Uncle Goran, the plumber. Record your message. It's Niko. I'm in trouble, I need help. Please call me. - Hi, Helena. - Hey Penguin, what a surprise! You're not a bouncer anymore? - Have you seen Uncle Goran? - I don't know anything about him. - And she? Your new girlfriend? - Her name's Justine, she comes from Poland. Hi, girl! Do you like Berlin? Fuck, we have to to! You haven't seen us! Uncle Goran? Yeah, I need help! OK, I'm on my way. Hey, wake up! We have to go. Don't make any scenes. Only Goran can protect your grandmother. - Who is it? - It's Niko, I was appointed. Come in, please. Cat's son always chases mice. - Are you in love? - No. - Is this love? - No, it's copulation. - I became free when I was forty. - I'm not in love, it's business. - What do you want from me? A street? - An apartment. We'll hide her. Show her. Uncle wants to meet you now. Don't be afraid. We don't use violence in here. I respect personal liberty. Come on. I'm too weak to use force. - Show me what you can do. - What do you want? I mean ways of making men happy. Power is delightful. I was hurt once, my wings cut. I was deprived of pleasure. Perseverance leads you to happiness. Any doubts lead to destruction. Do you know how to do it, or not? Dear Grandma. I feel I'm growing apart... I'm leaving... I'm not your Princess anymore. I feel wretched. Don't condemn me. I worry about you. Can you hear me? I love you. Tomorrow your grandmother will be safe. Goran always keeps his promises. Crunchy wings and ice-cream. Thank you and goodbye. We'll be fine together. Let me go home. Hello, it's Wolfgang Muller. I'll call you later. The dial cannot be made. Hello, it's Stephan Krauss, my number is 709733282. Look, what Uncle Goran fixed for us. East European beauty Za Za. A bigot and a dominatrix. Do you like it? - Can you play Za Za? - No, I'll answer the phones. Get dressed. Let's go to work! - Hello? - It's me, Harald. Hello. Please, come in. The girl's waiting. The apartment is clean. Here you have. So have fun. Get undressed. You must help me. I need your help, call the police! Do you understand, the police! No, no police, full discretion. - I'm jailed. I'm not free. - I don't understand. I come from Poland. I need your help. Please. - No problem... - I come from Poland, you have to help me... How are things? How are things? I think he's leaving soon. - A hundred. - A hundred and fifty. I need her for longer. Not so fast. Where are you from? - Poland. - Poland! It's a beautiful place. - What's your name? - Justine. - And the real one? - Za Za. Let's do it. It's late. I hate pretending. I want a real you. I'll pay you well. I am real. What's wrong? I need your help. Get me out of here, I'm jailed. - You're jailed? - I'll do everything what you want if you help me. Whatever I want? Deal? Deal. Dear Grandma. I call you in my thoughts. If you hear me, give me a sign. Don't leave me. I don't know what I want. I've too much work. Everything is OK... You liked him, huh? I did what you teached me. I made some extra money. A hundred for Goran, eighty for me and twenty for you. Give me my money! What's yours is mine, what's mine is yours. Forgot it? You can sell me, but you'll never have me! Let me go home! You wanna drink? I made a soup for you. Wanna give me a hand? You know how to cut it? Mr Muller. It's me, Muller. Where is she?! I haven't seen her for a long time... Mariolka! They want me to return the money they paid me, you know? Listen, I know you've been through much lately... but I have really bad news for you. About your grandma. What news? Really bad. Don't... Don't kill me Then go... Go away... Go! I am not Justine... My name is Mariola... Mariola Szymanska, get out, please! Dear Grandma. How much strength one needs to have? What for? Where is love? Where are dreams? Where is this bloody justice? My sentence wasn't harsh. My grandma died two weeks after I left. She had a heart disease. Mariola, come on! Dear Grandma. You died in your sleep. The birds flew off. The girls are married now and they seem to be happy. And me? Maybe one day... Somewhere. A little princess in her castle is waiting for the birds to fly off. A dream looms under the eyelids, in a moment it will touch the lips.
