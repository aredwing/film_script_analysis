You must continue to make new things. Maybe they get back together. Steve Angello, Axwell and Sebastian Ingrosso. What are the plans? A great tour? Yes, a huge world tour. That's the plan. And what happens after the tour? I think we all continue our solo career. We continue to make music. The same. Did you fight with each other? - No. How can it still work? I can not. Swedish House Mafia announced in June 2012 that it would stop at they wanted one last time on tour within a week there were a million tickets sold... 50 shows the world I like to start the day with music. You listen, but in a passive way. This is the best hit. The best part is where the beat begins with immediately after a pause. I mean, it just started. That's cool. Then it comes back. It's so much... The laundry has my stuff delivered. I came here with only five clean T-shirts. But now almost all crops. Now I have sixteen T-shirts. I do not fit in this T-shirt. I feel fat and bloated. Damn, I do not have a cap or something with me. Maf. I do not feel good at. Wait. Damn. I can not forget my wedding ring. Where did I put my cigarettes? Ticket sales for One Last Tour starts. 50 performances in 26 countries. We must now switch on the tour mood. We need to warm us and be ready. The group is obviously not for anything apart. How do they keep things during that whole tour together? Madison Square Garden was sold out in nine minutes. Jojo on the radio, sit next to me members of Swedish House Mafia. They are unlike any others. They have made popular house. They say two heads are better than one. And then three? They put you in a good mood. Their individual styles, the way they merge. We love it. The stage consists of 26 Kinesys motors holding up three video screens. Two in front, one in back. All energy comes from the front. That's a lot of laser. There's about 800 LED panels. What fiercely. I do not think they've ever had. Complex such fireworks These are the PRG Bad Boys. Three pieces, one for each man. It is an attack on all the senses. It is very important that we can sit on top of... us because this is the biggest we've ever done together. Stockholm home Swedish House Mafia This is the new single from Swedish House Mafia where everyone looked. The title is Do not You Worry Child. Steve Angello has arrived. About. It is small, huh? Awesome. Yes, say that again. It's great, but... - but also intimate. It's great in a natural way. It's not like... Well, a little. Damn. This is impressive. Wait. What happened there before it fell? What happened to the lights? That was a different mix. You'll always hear a different mix. - I know. We need this. It looks a little dead out. Getting started. This is my favorite part because you see how big it is. Everyone will do so. Love is everywhere Sweden 50 more performances to go Can we take a quick photo? - We do not have time. We're from California. Until tonight. Yeah, cool. My psychiatrist said go stress out of the way... and do it the next day easy. Swedish House Mafia, Swedish House Mafia. Be ready. Just 15 seconds. The artists are on the way. This is the beginning of the end. What's going through you? I do not see it as an end. At the moment, it feels like a beginning. You do all these towns with your best friends. You make fun and you discover things. You're playing in the best venues. This is a dream come true. I am already on to go with the boys. We will fix entertain us. I'm glad we both travel the world and that we do this once and for all. We take smashing goodbye. We come, we dig, we love Ingrosso. - Axwell is tight. That was crazy. Insanely. They are a legend. They're in my heart, my blood, everywhere. Swedish House Mafia, you may not stop. How are you? Knoeipot. We're dropping out. Daddy loves you. Day. It makes her nothing, long as they can play. Day. What do you want for Christmas? A watch. I want a daddy-watch. - Would you like a watch like daddy? A black. - Would you like a black? Just as big? What? - Diamonds. Soon. Sing opera. You want me to sing opera? Just like in the car. - In the car? That was our secret. Dad, come on. Come on, fat boy. Go ahead. - Good. Do it, slacker. Leon. Okay, thanks. - Pleasure. Later. Yeah, that's good. At the end of the tour we stop. Another cigarette. One more. - I do not have a lighter. 'Partouze." My father started in '89 a record, Plump House and Loop Records. They spent a lot of deep tech house, techno and acid house. I fell in love with the energy and intensity. 'What is this?' Something happened to my body, with the beats and bass... and tomdrums, and everything was built into something totally new. I felt that the public would ever feel. The audience will love it, I can not be mistaken. I had to find other people who did the same . I'll tell you how I got to know Steve. He was a hip-hop DJ. We went on with the same people and were grown together. We saw that we had the same interest. He was the first of two turntables. You could then nowhere Technic 1210 to come. I always bought records and listened to him because I did not record. He said: You should not listen to this music. This is nothing, what inspires you? I wore orange pants, hair back, luminous T-shirt. I was about to jump into his room, and he was smoking weed... there in his baggy trousers, like Steve could look like. He had a lot of energy, he was always happy and very witty. He always wanted to do things. He had spikes and Buffalo shoes. A true raver. He made hip-hop beats. I was celebrating, puberde and drank beer. He just wanted to work. We went to the office of my father. I had a CD, Homework Daft Punk. I saw Steve's face that something was happening. That was what happened to me as a child when I listened to techno. The first time I heard that, I was in shock. He said: I do not know what happened, but I got a musical orgasm from here. I remember that he and I were in the same world, from hip hop to techno. Wow. What is it? Do you smell it? Yes. Have I done it in my pants? What is it? - I'm going to vomit. I smell something? - I do not know. Does it come out of my mouth? - No. What happened to your hat? Is there anything? You pooped in your hat. - Is that it? Yes, I think so. No, that's not it. Does anyone eat dog poo? Yes, it comes out of my mouth. Do you eat dog poo? What? What is it? It comes from here. It's that damn food. Software I discovered that you could make music at school. Nerds as I got together and made a demo. A programmer made super advanced stuff on the screen. So he left a square rotating. Then there was anyone in music. Then you had a demo. Computer Whiz music, demo music, which is the amateur version of techno and trance. The better I became, and the computers were, however how it began to sound. You can look it up. It is very fast and quite amateurish. I remember when I heard that song in the drum part. It was funky, it was groovy. We met in a restaurant. He was a kid that came within. 'Boys' He said, 'Boys, hello." 'My God, it's you, I just heard a number of you. Great." Ax looked at me with such a look: Where did that guy talking about? He was very enthusiastic. It was clear that he had Italian blood. I said: Do you have a studio in Stockholm? I come tomorrow, what's your number? He is a bit pushy, a little goofy. - I am to 3 pm. But you should know that I'm from the south of Sweden. We are very reserved, very quiet and Swedish. I pick some music, I take it Steve and go to the studio. If you meet someone who loves to dance, you have two dogs in a room. They sniff each other poeperd and run laps. We said, 'You like to dance?" We had to befriend. Let's get in the mood. Can you rewind something? Always the same hi-hats. Here we go. Say: Greyhound. How are you? - I do not have it. Come on. Would you like a glass of water? I can not breathe. We are three ordinary guys from Stockholm. Do not break the illusion. We are not ordinary. What are you talking about? One, two, three. The performers are on stage. Austria 46 more performances to go Where are we now? I can not ski. - I do not. Unbelievable. Netherlands The more you think about it, the more you realize how far dance has come. Ten years ago, we had never been at Madison Square Garden. Suddenly we can play in any stadium in the world. 1, 2, 3, partouze. Czech It blows your mind on and open your heart, again and again. I love Russia. Whoever stops at its peak? - What are we going to do next? Bigger than this is not it. We would only repeat ourselves. We realized that the biggest change was to stop. It's early and it might not the best decision ever... but it's still exciting. It is obviously sad, but we also just of: "Finally." In a weird way. It is an end, but it is also a rousing finale. The first time I heard Greyhound, I was freakin 'out. I had rarely heard such a good song. Did you know they opened with Greyhound? Yes, I knew that. What do you do when you hear that? - Then I'll go, I'll scream. Then I'm going insane, as is usually music. Ready? Start. The winner of the Grand Prix, Axwell. Hello, darling. With dad. Hello, you talk to dad. At night, night, night I sail with my boat the stormy, turbulent waters Good public. Very good. Damn good audience. 20,000 people went absolutely crazy. The adrenaline poured through the webs and we beat on the drums. And then a quiet, not very romantic hotel room. I can not complain, but I was in a whirlwind. I get almost panicked. I need to cool down. I've thought of something. Would we ever get into that MTV program One Hit Wonders? "What's become of... ' Right Said Fred hit, and what has happened to them afterwards? Remember that group, Swedish House Mafia? They had a number Do not You Worry Child. The three members are now busy with their own things. With less success than Do not You Worry Child. One of them has become a crack addict. Another bought a lot of houses he had to sell it later. After a few years she made a reunion tour where no audience was coming. At number 10 One Hit Wonders, Swedish House Mafia. That could happen. Like I said, you have the feeling... we got the key to the golden city and have thrown away. We could not continue and may be even greater. It was very organic. It is rather the fans who Swedish House Mafia made than us. 'Swedish House Mafia Will we be?" We were boys who made fun and loved music. We enjoyed every second. You had the feedback after the performances, the comments. What people wrote about us, she loved it. Then it was a festival, then we got fixed locations. We started it for fun, not knowing what we put in motion. We were not thinking about what we put in motion. We planned anything. Are you ready for Swedish House Mafia? We did not see it as a long-term career. If we all had a dream, this was our dream: 'Are we going to go abroad? This is for the first time. " So it went with everything. "It's the first and last performance, let's make it a party." It was the right moment in time, the right time for this music. The right time for our music at that time. We had found gold. It has become a huge machine, a monster. This is the official number one in Britain, Do not You Worry Child. It's a good day today. We celebrated six years celebration. - Constant, five days a week. After two days of traveling. It was not just alcohol that we consumed. We did pretty much everything. A few years ago, I woke up after my birthday. The ground was littered with beer bottles, liquor. There was everything, everywhere you looked people. I woke up and I thought, that's enough. I threw everyone out, on my friends after. I said: Who wants to stop this, may join me. If you want this to go through delete my number and then not call me. Thus ended it. Since that day I have behaved decently. It started with a bit of balls, no responsibilities. We only had to show up, drinking and partying. Now we are at this level, more is expected of us. Otherwise we are seen as failures. I do not want to. I feel that there is a difference in how much we put into. Do you see what's in there? Bitch. Look at the lion. That's the sound I was afraid of. I did not want to hear. They go in there. Do they go to the cheetahs in? Unbelievable. - Are they dangerous? I hope you like it. Hopefully you are not wimps. I'm a wimp, I admit it. Thither. - Lovely. You can leave if you do not like. - So you can leave. I'm standing here. You can watch. I do not want it. - If they lash out, I make them dead. I promise you. You can get them the best acclimate by letting them lick your scent on you. If he snort, then it's okay. - Can I remove my hand? No, take your hand away. - Now? Now it can. It's not a problem. - No? Okay. Very good. You've done it. - I did not like it. Did not like you? No, it's not for me. Look. Remember when I said two years ago... We had to concentrate? Us all to Swedish House Mafia I do not know whether we then used drugs. We need to focus our subsequent and our solo things have to give. Yes, you did. - But nothing happened. If we had concentrated our then that this was not a problem. We play here twice for 27,000 people. To achieve that they deserve, the level we need to focus on this. A few months go into the studio, leave our family. Or go back to Sweden and sitting there together in the studio. You're talking about commitment. Are you just arrived? - Exactly. Many people ask this question: Is it really over? Or is it a beginning? Pause as you to do? Your own thing Are you later maybe back together? Would you answer this question? We all think the same way. We agree with this decision. We've just never talked about. A few hours a week, everything is great. We are nostalgic about the music and feel the magic. But then we fall back into a void. There is something that is not being talked about. The times we tried there to do... something That was very laborious. That has nothing. Instead we swept under the carpet. We have an opinion but do not talk about. So it is. No one likes to still fight? Axwell, fuck me Philippines, Singapore and Indonesia It's stuffy in here. This tour would be called One Last Complaint. We constantly complain when everything is perfect. We are looking for things to complain about. It's a mess. I have never experienced before. Open up the window. - Now you complain again. I just asked if the window was open. - It's true. We are always looking for things that are wrong. Just enjoy. We get older, it is different. We draw less with each other. We live in different places. It's not the same. We each have our own agenda. We live always somewhere else. Swedish House Mafia We have not given the commitment... where the group is entitled. Every friendship, in every relationship-at-a-distance... It is in the beginning very close, and then goes out. Mexico 20 more performances to go What a disgusting view, huh? Okay, just checking. Billboard. Number 1, Bruno Mars. Yes. Number 7 In the Top 10 Insanely - .. That's crazy. - Unbelievable. Why stop you as you have so much success? We are working on a world tour... and put all other projects aside... even and say goodbye to our fans. Maybe you can take over from me. I think... We had a great time. It's like my father once said: If the cheetah coming your way, you need the cheetah floors. That is, it has become so big... And we wanted it really, as Sebastian said, close to a perfect level. So we say: Occasionally, cheetah. They must think we're the president. "No, three DJs from Sweden." I see no crack. No, I need to vomit. I want to vomit. Damn it, where is it? Someone runs around with. 2011 a year for the tour We went to Australia and rented a big house on the water. We said: We're going Do not You Worry Child making. Damn, it's hot. So warm is not. He gives 33 degrees. They say sharks are here. You should not be in the water. We do not do that. I want to make music that sounds like this view. Can we make music that sounds? - Yeah. How does this sound? I think a few notes higher. Maybe another. Another one. That's him! Now I'm going to do the beats. That's tight, man. Let's see if having that effect. - I will try all three. You mean... Here's the deal. I want this meets with a little angel sitting on my neck. He did not take on? He can not record when he is tattooed. How long does that tattoo? - That depends on how complicated it is. This took three hours because it consists of several layers. What silly to do that when we rented a house to make music. Can not you also have a tattoo in LA? If I'm not mistaken. This will hurt. No one is involved. We are here, I have my family left, Steve and his family... to five days to work here. I'm sick of it. Nothing comes off the ground, we never get that CD out on this trip. We must remain in the room and be creative and have fun. When he comes, he will complain it hurts. This is worthless. Ax and I talk with Steve if we have time for. If he does not understand, then we have a big problem. There is the prodigal son. - I did not think it would take so long. That was a bad idea. - The tattoo? You knew that three months ago, al- We are here to work. Yeah, but still. - It's worthless. It was not a great idea. Anyway, let's get to work. We felt that we were going in the right direction... but we did not get very far. And then we were off again. At the same time it was not good with Swedish House Mafia. Are we set to do tomorrow? I do not spoil me, but it is tight. - You play, so you should go. I can cancel our things going for it. We can do tomorrow. You can count on me tomorrow, I swear. There are many things which everyone time and effort into it... without getting appreciation. If I have 6000 meetings, I do not put that on the spreadsheets. Seb has a lot of studio sessions over beaten... but I've never thrown him to the feet. I do not care. We do this together. You know, we have had with Swedish House Mafia. Already well Why not let it at that? We know we can not go against it. We do not want a group that is only half the bet. No one is busy it to a higher lift. We want our friendship not ruin by accusations that the other is doing too little. When I have suggested what I thought for a while: 'Shall we stop with Swedish House Mafia?" We would like to announce that this is our last tour is We want to thank everyone who join us in this adventure has entered we came, and beloved raveden After the show they wrote on their website: it's over. 'Swedish House Mafia, forever in my heart." 'Pockets, you have shit on your fans." "Something died in me, fagots." 'With the end of the Swedish House Mafia house music dies." 'Rewarding you so your fans, " mark. "My greatest hope and interest has died." 'Damn, I'm heartbroken." 'Why, why, why? No, no, no. Do not do it." They called me: We're breaking up, fuck, this is nothing. It's gotten so big so fast. It's just really like you mean and if everyone loves each other. But energy is not pure. It was One Last Tour on. That Swedish House Mafia has successfully no one can deny. You have hits, have performed in sold-out stadiums worldwide. Are not you afraid of a future without SHM? Not really. We are now here and enjoy this moment. I look forward to what is to come hereafter. There is no comprehensive plan. - Exactly. We have always done this, brought our own music... and played without the others at large events. We see this as the end of an incredible journey we made as friends. It just feels right. We all saw that there is an end to the dance. We said: We have to do this. We were looking forward to to keep up with the group. Then we announced... that Milton Keynes Bowl our last show in the UK would be. We said: Yes, there goes our last single in premiere. Result, we had a deadline to finish this thing. If you tell 60,000 people that they will hear it... Do not You Worry Child then you should finish it. Milton Keynes Bowl UK, 2012 You have had tremendous performances. Why is it this time so special? It is the last performance of Swedish House Mafia in the UK. Can you confirm that Do not You Worry Child your next single will be? Yes. For the last time in the UK. Milton Keynes, speak up. Swedish House Mafia. Australia 19 more performances to go Do not You Worry Child has been nominated for a Grammy. You are number 1 in the UK. Number 1 iTunes in 42 countries. Swedish House Mafia's first number 1 hit in Britain. We want everyone to sit down. Sit down, everybody. If the number starts... We want you to jump. Are you ready? Malaysia 13 more performances to go Here is the warm, huh? Yes. Am I in Hawaii? - You are in Malaysia. Do you wreaths that too? Nice. Can you also to sing a song? Not for me, thank you. You should take one. - Of course not. That's rude. - You need to do him. Why? - Out of courtesy. Who decides? - Their culture. There I shit on. Did you know that this was a theme park? - Oh? It's so weird. I do not see myself more as a DJ occur when I'm 40. I'll still do it, but I do not go on tour. You never know how long this continues. Time will tell. Everything comes to an end. I've cried myself to sleep tonight. Really? - I have a hard time. So it goes sometimes in life. You should get rid of all the shit. Pity. - Anders comes back later. I've reached a point... I want to get things clear. Why can not we talk like adults about ? What are we doing? We behave like teenagers. This is not from the ground. I can not. I concentrate completely on SHM. If you do not have everyone sit in a line... feeling which is quite annoying. Throw it out. If you have something to say, say it . What's the problem? If you do not discuss problems immediately, let it sit. It wears you out, you know. But we want war? Because that would be. We need to relax, okay? So stupid. I think Steve left. - Where? No idea. Curly took him to a car. It is what it is. It's over, you know. This year there are a lot of things happened which made me realize... that we are no longer close friends. That's the truth. Normally we say: "We have achieved what we wanted to achieve." This is also called as, but maybe it should not continue. Los Angeles Hiatus He's coming. Come here, shark. The wind has spoken. What she has grown. Look. - Would you like a flower? Hello, darling. You may never go away. Who's here. - Dad. Daddy, I love you. - I love you too. I've missed you. And a kiss. How are you? - Good. Look, I'm going swimming. Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to Indira Gandhi International Airport, New Delhi. The outside temperature is 27 degrees Celsius. Thank you. - Have a nice day. Nikhil, when I was first in India? - 2007. That was so unique, the energy was incredible. I thought, wow, this is insane, I have to come here more often. In India, there are now millions of fans of dance music. That's him. He has begun. An old friend of mine. Axwell will be amazed at the number of fans that he in India has now... compared to 2007 I want to go out of my roof and listen to the music as a drooling dog. There are many people who are coming to see them. I have a special bond with them. If I see them playing... I get a feeling I do not get with other DJs. I'm Axwell. These are Sebastian Ingrosso and Steve Angello. Together we are Swedish House Mafia. What happened? Axwell, Sebastian Ingrosso and Steve Angello... have this tent put on the head. This night was insane. I'm speechless. We have been waiting for so long. You have no idea. I think this will change in India-house movement. It has matured. There are 15,000 to 20,000 people. EDM has grown up in India, let me put it this way. I would love to smoke when I see you. You look like Burt Reynolds. I could be your pipes. You feel bad when you start smoking. Do not do it. Give me that thing. It's just a cigarette. I have the best for you. - I know. North America last weeks of the tour Michelle, Amy. I only have a minute, I'm in the middle in the organization of a festival. When can we call and how long will it take? I'm actually the president of Swedish House Mafia. They are like a second family to me. I called Steve Angello and asked if I could book him. He said: Good. I also called Axwell. Steve introduced me to Sebastian. I remember she wore slobberkleding. Especially Steve. I think she knew that was because their music was so damn good. They knew what they heard, they knew what they were. They were like: Yes, just listen to. And who are you? - Steve Angello. Okay, fine. Comments? - Vet. Axwell, what have you to say? In the beginning there was house. At the end there was house. And Axwell is in the middle. Some of us have made mistakes. The fact that we do not sit together... and have said sorry to us, is very unfortunate. But I also think that it had come then not good. I think happiness is more important for all of us... become part of Swedish House Mafia. New York 5 more performances to go We have here today members of Swedish House Mafia... Axwell, Steve and Sebastian, to help the Empire State Building to enlighten us. Hello, New York. This is our first visit to the Empire State Building. How wonderful to visit while it is lit with the Swedish colors. It is soon over. The circle is almost complete. It starts emotional feelings loosen. At the beginning it did not feel like the end, that was so far away. I did not think it would be over so quickly. Do you regret it? - Sometimes. Sometimes. Here comes Sebastian Ingrosso. Now look, Swedish House Mafia. Can we take a picture before it starts? - With your tough outfit. You need to chill, you. According to him, this is the best outfit I've ever had, especially when I do oil. Why oil? Alex, who am I? - Sebastian. Now? - Swedish House Mafia. We need Ax as the man who was always there. I deugde itself from any side in the beginning. I made lol. I took it for granted that Ax and Steve were there. I could quietly celebrate with a couple of guys, they expand it right. Four years later, I woke up: What have I done? But this year and the year before I worked myself silly... to Ax and Steve show I wanted to give them something... for all the years that she me hand held above the head. Do you want to celebrate? She says: I'm Paris Hilton. I say: So what? Give me a hug. I'm so hyper. I'm going to fucking numb nightclub. You have swag. I have never seen so many people smile. Who can repeat after me they have drummed at Madison Square Garden? I drank my earplugs turned off and vodka, so beautiful it was. Yes, such a glass. I needed that. If it continues, we use at the end of the tour again coke. And we stoned every time. I think so too. Look at the last show. Back to the beginning. Why not? - Why not? Hell Why have you chosen Miami to join Swedish House Mafia off? We come every year in Miami for the Conference. So it was a natural thing... to scatter our ashes here so we can see that occasionally. Say hi to the guys. Good luck and thank you for everything you have done... people and the fun you people have donated. We have this before without the others did. Then we go apart from the others. So strange is not it. We are all different. It's hard to... It's over now, anyway. This was the end. There are many among you what is not spoken. Yes, it will never be pronounced. Maybe later. You never know. Then we are older. Hopefully we will meet each other in Ibiza... whether we drink a glass of wine together and talk about it, or not. In the beginning I suggest us and say: We are still Swedish House Mafia. Or: We are again Swedish House Mafia. No, you better say... - This is much better. The last time you said... I felt like I was in the audience and everyone wanted to sew. Yes, this is, bam. Do we need later on? Yes. Are you sure? Very fast. We should go and warming us, the drums beat. We need to get into the rhythm. - I'm a nervous wreck. Last performance Ultra Music Festival Miami. I will always be friends with them. But it is not the same in terms of work. We had something fantastic. It's always sad to see things disappear you loved. But we held our ground. We can look back on it. That's something I want to cherish. Fortunately we have friendship. We have a happy relationship. It's sad when you are at a standstill, but it also has something beautiful. We have together created something and we were soul mates. We have undertaken this adventure together. It's not from lack of effort that we're apart. We just want to stop here, we want friendship not screw up. It could have been worse we can throw... with chairs and body can go together with knives. But we do not want. Sing, Miami. It can be louder. I think I also speak for the others... when I thank you for this great adventure... and for the love we have received. Words fail. I'm happy, but sad at the same time. Madison Square Garden. Barclays, Barclays. I'm going to a certain number of times to my brothers. The vibes are strong. Energy. I'll never get over this. - The most beautiful night of my life. Too bad they stop. - But it's okay with them. Separately? Yes, but it's nice to see them together. Maybe they'll come back. They should stay together. Everyone loves them, it's a great group of people. They were the best thing that happened to me in my whole life. People can not touch me, but Swedish House Mafia apparently. I can die a happy man. We are still Swedish House Mafia. Miami, thanks. You know we came, we raveden and we loved you.
