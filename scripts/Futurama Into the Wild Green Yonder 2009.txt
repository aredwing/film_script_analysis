Two, one, zero! Rest in hell, Crapville! Out here in the desert,|we're gonna build bigger, better Vegas. Bathtubs size of oceans,|hookers size of bouncers. Hamburger! Stand clear of the closing jaws. Yo, you need any|girders bent, I know a guy. So what's gonna|be over there, Dad? That? That the oasis. Future site of Oasis Hotel. Take that,|you stupid Mother Nature. Okay. Let's hit him hard. This land is your land|This land is my land Who are you noisy women? I'm Frida Waterfall, leader of the|Greenorita Eco-Feminist Collective, and we will not let you man-doze|this beautiful gyno-desert. Well, I'm Leo Wong, and I say, "Boom. " Hey, what happened to my femi-necklace?|And where's my mega-fem? Is he badly hurt, Dr. Zoidberg? I don't quite know how to say this. Fry is dead! Wait, not dead.|The other thing. Damn eco-broads! You can't even spray for eagles|without upsetting these kooks. Now, hang on.|Before you do construction, don't you have to make sure|you're not harming any native species? You mean, cursory|environmental survey? Already done! By top scientist. Oh, my, yes.|You've got the go-ahead, Mr. Wong. This place is deader than last year's cat. No, it's not! There's precious life|right here in this scum puddle. Ah! Cyprinodon martius.|The desert muck leech. Amazingly, the entire species|lives in this one tiny stinkhole. Killing these will be so much easier|than exterminating those ponies. Wait a second. Leeches may not be|cuddly like pandas or tribbles, but these poor|endangered creatures deserve... Get off me! I'll get it with my trusty foot cups:|Stompy and Smashy. No, don't kill it! We have to... There. They're not endangered anymore.|They're extinct. No, they're not. I saved this one. And I'm gonna raise it and care for it, so the world will|forever know what it's lost. You freaking slime wad! No. I killed it.|It was the last of its kind. Mother.|Let go of me, you... Poor thing. Tell you what, Fry.|You all promise not to sue me, I give you token for free|entry in poker tournament. He took it, you all saw it! Maybe we did, maybe we didn't.|What's in it for me, Bender? Okay, okay. Come back|when New Vegas opens, I give you all free rooms, free dinner and|free tickets to Celine Dion. Lose the Celine Dion tickets|and you got yourself a deal. All right, damn it, done! All right, I scored. Look out, Vegas, I've got a system. Oh. I'm bankrupt. You said it, Hermes.|He is pathetic, but lovable. Yup. What? I said no such thing, man. I am not acting weird, Leela.|Why is everyone talking at once? Fry, calm down and stop braining. Yeah, Fry, maybe you need... You're right, Amy!|Maybe I do need some fresh air. Man, I'm worried about him. But not enough to stop|gambling for even a single second. You win, damn it! It's all in the wrist. Voices always yelling. Who said that? I'm not insane.|Stop it. Stop talking in me! Voices bothering you, man?|I've been there. You need one of these doodangs. A foil hat?|Of course, he likes pastrami. What about the dog's testicles? Hey, it worked.|The voices stopped. They've got a huge|selection of carburetors... Hang on. Hang on. That's better. My name's Hutch. Hi, Hutch. So what's with the|obnoxious, shrieking voices? Are my fillings picking up The View? No, man. Truth is,|it's other people's thoughts. You're a mind reader. Oh, my God! Oh, my God!|Although, actually, it was sort of obvious. You don't believe me?|Take off the helmet. - I believe you.|- Seriously, do it. Testing, testing.|Do you read me? Loud and clear.|- What? I said, "Loud and clear. " Only I said it with my|thinker, not my talker. Whoa! Freaky.|Why can't I read your thoughts? I don't know. Wait.|What's that about a secret society? Never mind that. Just keep|the foil on and you'll be okay. Also, it'll keep the Dark Ones|from incinerating your brain. That's a plus. And don't ever, ever, ever|tell anyone you can read minds, or the Dark Ones|will get you like that. Hang on, pizza grease. Like that. Jeez, get a load of|the batteries on her. I'd like to get my clamps on those. Give her a jump,|you know what I mean? Whoa, whoa. Show some decorum there,|Clamps. This ain't no strip show. This is a beguiling display|of the pornographic arts. Yo, Skip, I can see a guy's butt. Oh, Michael, this is the perfect|end to a perfect honeymoon. I love you so much. - Is this seat taken?|- Actually, we... Slide me those chicken wings. So what part of|Podunk you rubes from? The north-eastern. Monsieurs et mademoiselles, our circus of the senses now arrives|by steamboat in New Orleans, circa 2873. The muted lament of a trombone|resonates through the fog, which lingers even now, months|after the attack of the fog monster. With but one hope of restoring|Gearoticus to his throne, our sensual fate|rests in the gyrations of Fanny. Oh. Yes? I'm Bender. Let's do it. Who is it, the Feds? Aren't you the Donbot,|head of the Robot Mafia? Allegedly.|And this is my beloved wife, Fanny, whose honor I would|proudly defend with a power drill. Well, I gotta go drown a stoolie. I'm gonna be in here a while, so do|me a favor and drive my wife home. It's one of them self-driving cars, so|just sit in the back and do whatever. Oh, Bender,|your lips are intoxicating. It's like kissing|an ashtray full of hot wings. My God, I really can read minds.|I have a superpower! There must be something|great I can do with this. Hello, ladies,|I can read your thoughts. Oh, wait, that's invisibility. Poker. With my mind-reading|abilities and my invisibility... Wait, no, just the mind reading.|I can't lose! Sign me up for the tournament, please. Okey-doke, Jiffy Pop.|Entry fee's 50,000 smackers. 50,000? Drat, all I have is my life savings and a token for free admission|to this poker tournament. Close enough. You're having an affair with|the head of the robot mafia's wife? Yup, this is|her I'm making out with. Bender, are you crazy? No, it's Fry who's crazy in this one. I'm not crazy. You sure you're okay, Fry? I mean, you do have|tin foil on your head. So? You got a leech on your neck. And speaking of sucking on your|neck, want to go to a movie later? Hey, there!|How are you folks doing tonight? Great. What are the specials? Well, let's see now.|We've got a wonderful grizzly bear that's been dipped in cornmeal|and lightly tormented. - Questions?|- What was the bear's name? - Jojo.|- Ooh, I'll have him. - Hide me!|- Hey, Donbot, ain't that your wife what|with you had that wedding with? Donbot, honey!|What a pleasant shock! I was just having dinner alone,|when suddenly you walk in on us. Alone, huh? Where am I? I was exploring a wormhole through space|many light years from this restaurant, when suddenly I was|surrounded by darkness. Hot, sexy darkness. Why, hello, Donbot! Hello, miss,|have we met? I'm Bender. The world's most sexual robot. I mean, the world's most|boundary-respecting robot. Nice to see you, Bender.|Welcome back to our universe. Listen, sugar, I stuck up|the Burlington Coat Factory and got you a little something.|It's a $49 value. Donbot, I love you! - Not really.|- Man, this is great! I always wanted to nail a dame|in a fur coat, and now's my chance. I mean, if you'll introduce me to|one, sir. One as sexy as you, baby! Bender out. I never felt so alive, Bender. Listen, this turquoise-encrusted|bra is worth 50 grand. Let's sell it and run off|before the Donbot gets wise. No. It will take a lot more money|than that to make a girl like you happy. - No, it won't.|- Yeah, it will. Shut up! We'll run off, but not till after I win|the Universal Poker Championship! One entry, please. Bender, no! You can't beat|the best players in the universe. - You're not lucky enough.|- Oh, no? I'm 40% lucky. The scrap metal I'm made from|included a truckload of horseshoes from the luckiest racehorses in Mexico,|who had just been sent to a glue factory. - They don't sound so lucky to me.|- Not without their shoes. That's great! Here, Bendy, take this.|It will give you 70% more luck. It's the Donbot's lucky robot's foot. All right!|With two kinds of luck, I can't lose. No, wait, three.|I stepped on a leprechaun. Yo, you see this over here over there? I'm powering up the clamps. Whoa, whoa, whoa.|Let us not rush to judgment. But, Skip, that was your lucky robot's|foot what came off of your lucky leg. While it is true that I did wake up|with only one foot this morning, there is no proof that my|beloved Fanny was involved. Aside from the hacksaw|I found under her pillow. Well, what about that Bender guy?|You want I should give him the clamps? Not yet, Clamps. Only one thing|can prove that he has my lucky foot. Torture with the clamps|or a clamp-like device? No. We are gonna sit tight and see|if he wins the poker tournament. He does, that proves|he's packing my lucky foot, in which event... The clamps! Or a clamp-like device. Welcome viewers|who fell asleep with the TV on! It's the 3009 no-limit|hold 'em championship. I'm the massive head|of Penn Jillette, and here with a color|commentary, my partner Teller. Our act really didn't|change much when he died. Pardon me,|I'm new to this game. Is this duffle bag big|enough for all your money? Bender? Oh, boogers.|We're in the same tournament. Quick, get your entry fee|back before I bankrupt you. In your dreams, nutloaf. Bite my shiny metal hat. Tex Connecticut,|the pride of Kansas City, first to act. Smiley Spiff, up next. Looks like Boobs Vanderbilt|has a decent pair. Also, she's got two eights. And Bender Rodriguez picks|up a lucky deal right off the bat. Two aces.|I'm thinking guitar solo. I fold. Holy crap! A stunning play by|mentally ill newcomer Philip Fry. It's almost as if|he knew Bender had two aces. Bender has two aces? I'm out. - I'm out.|- I'm out. Suck my luck! See this gun? That's what I'm gonna|do to Bender if he wins. All in. Call my mighty bid at your peril. My cards are awful, and I need a hug. I call your bluff. I shall annihilate... I just wanted to|make my daddy proud. Well, you didn't. I want you and|your junk moved out by Monday. It's getting|pretty intense, folks. Based on the state of|decomposition of Teller's head, we're now in hour|19 of the tournament. And the first bad deal|of the night for Bender. Hey, pal, help me out here.|This is the worst possible hand, right? I'm all in. All in! I mean, fold. Whatever. Well, Bender's luck just ran out.|No card can save him from elimination. Oh, my gourds! He's dead. 21, winner! I'm so full of luck,|it's shooting out like luck diarrhea. Wake up, poker fans! We're down to our final two players in|heads-up action for the Championship. Your perspective, Teller? All in. But you didn't even|look at your cards! Looking at one's cards is|a crutch for players who rely on skill. Any day now, Fry. You in or out? What's the matter, Fry,|you scared? Or just crazy? All right, all in. Yes! Four aces! Ah-ah-ah. Read 'em and weep,|and then tell me what they are. Two kings. And with three on the board,|that gives Bender five kings. - But how is that...|- I don't believe it. Bender has just been|dealt the King of Beers, a coaster from the bar that|somehow got mixed into the deck. But it still counts! Bender win the Championship! That's some good money. You did it, Bender.|You're the greatest. Tell me something|I don't know, sweetass. Now, let's boogie. We'll be in Space Tahiti before|the Donbot knows what hit him. Now I am suspicious. Okay, we finished digging this|shallow grave. Can we go now? Poor Bender left me one last voicemail before the Robot Mafia|buried him in the desert. Fry, old friend,|before I die, I just wanted to say... Hang on, I'm getting another call. Hello? Line up, people! Everyone take|a shovel and one sixth of the planet. We'll meet back here in 50 years,|our bodies broken and our lives wasted. And you say these are free shovels? I'm back, baby. Bender! I thought the|Robot Mafia killed you. Nah, they just shot us and buried us|a few times as a warning. Bender was so brave. He never stopped making out with me|the whole time they were shooting us. I sure didn't. I gotta get back to my husband, baby.|Will I see you tonight? Probably not. It's a 14-footer with a clown hazard.|What club you recommend, Baggy? As on every hole,|I suggest the putter. Your golf club sure is classy,|Mr. Wong. Naked statue classy. It is very nice. I just wish Amy and I didn't have to|wear these sexist badges on our melons. We're lucky even to play as guests, Leela. Dad's club has a very|strict "No girls allowed" policy. - That doesn't seem fair.|- It really is. Everybody knows women|don't have the focus to play miniature golf|at a professional level. But that's the|best shot of the day! Is that my ball?|I think that my ball. - Great putt, Dad.|- Okay, we're done. Mr. Wong, how do you keep this place|so green in the middle of the desert? Doesn't that waste a lot of water? Nah, we got plenty water,|pumped directly from flamingo lake. They'll be fine. Oh, yeah, I love miniature golf.|Love everything about it, except how damn miniature it is. That's why I'm building the universe's|biggest miniature golf course. - This the first tee.|- Where's the hole? On Pluto's moon, Hydra. It's a six-billion-mile par-two.|Tough shot, even for a man. Around the sun.|Bank off Jupiter. And right into the... I'll be right back. It dropped in!|Put me down for a two. Two. Keep in mind,|that just the first hole. For full course, we gonna bulldoze|this entire arm of the Milky Way. What? You're gonna wipe out 10%|of the galaxy for a stupid golf course? First of all, it 12%.|Second, yes, you betcha. But you have no idea what life|forms might be evolving out there. That's exactly why|I'm hiring an impartial scientist to perform an environmental survey.|That's him in the money shower. Delivery boy's log. Having fallen|asleep on what I thought was the toilet, I awoke to find|the environmental survey in progress. - Status reports, Science Officer.|- Zilcho. No sign of life or intelligence. Just like Fry on a date. Hey! Okay, so we haven't|found any life yet. I still don't see why you men can't be|happy with regular-sized miniature golf. Leela, evolution has|programmed our fabulous male brains to take anything anybody else thinks|is important and make it bigger. Have you seen my new 301-inch TV? Hypnotoad is brought to|you by the MagnaPhallix 302-inch TV. It's bigger! Oh, hell! Captain, I'm detecting|life on the spock-o-scope! It's amazing. It's like|a textbook on evolution. Except in Kansas. But isn't Mr. Wong|building the 18th hole here? And the golf pants museum? Indeed so. This whole|area will be incinerated when he implodes that|sun there into a black hole. That beautiful violet star? It's so you can't keep|your ball at the end of the game. Yo, that's messed up. Well, there won't be any imploding once|they read our environmental review. - Right, Professor?|- Twaddle-squat. There's no scientific|consensus that life is important. Yeah. Life, schmife. Approved for demolition. It's you and me, ponytail. We're here, Mr. President. Let's play some mini-golf. Now, just give it a light tap, Agnew.|No, no, no, just a light... Now for a triple clam dip, with a double... Ow! Tough luck, Agnew. Looks like you|and Wong owe me a Charleston Chew. - Shut up and hear our wisdom.|- Shut up and hear our wisdom. - Save the ecosystem.|- Save the ecosystem. Shut up and hear|our wisdom! Save the ecosystem! What gives, Wong?|You said no chicks allowed. We are the Greenorita|Eco-Feminist Collective, and we will not let you...|What was it again? We will not let you implode|the violet dwarf star at galactic coordinates|167.84, -58.03, mark 948. Already approved, you cackling hens. So get out, or I'll have vice-president|Agnew's headless body throw you out. I'd like to see him try. Me, too. Should look funny.|Sic 'em, Agnew. Runaway golf cart! Look out, Agnew! - Whoa!|- Aah! Is he okay? No pulse. They killed the headless|remains of Agnew. Arrest them! All feministas|she-vacuate the premises. I mean "femises. " My fellow Earthicans, these eco-crooks will|face the maximum sentence. For killing a headless|torso, that's six weeks. Well, this is embarrassing. Here I've been blabbing on|for years about killing all humans, and who actually does|something about it? Some chick. Leela's not a killer,|and she's not some chick. She's the chick I love. And don't tell her|I called her a chick, or she'll kill me. Everyone stay absolutely quiet! - That thing's on.|- Turn it off! Oh, sorry. How do you turn it off? There. Did that do it? No. Stop it. Shut up. Here's the button here. And I think I... Now I got it. Let me give you a hand. This is awful. I never meant for our protest to|have any effect. Now what do we do? Maybe we should just surrender|and serve our six weeks in jail. Hey, yeah! We could do each|other's toenails and make shivs. That's crazy.|We've done nothing wrong, other than killing and|dismembering the vice-president. We need to make a choice, sisters. We can either keep pestering criminals|like Leo Wong with silly slogans... - Yeah.|- Let's do that. Actually, I meant that to be|the less preferable alternative. We can either chant slogans|or we can take action. What was the first choice again? I choose to save the environment by|sabotaging Leo Wong's golf course. Who's with me? Could we still use our bullhorns? Absolutely. Bullhorns are a core|principle of eco-feminism. Then I'm in. Uh, take that Yeah, yeah Uh-huh, uh-huh, yeah Izzy, Izzy, ah|Zizah, zizah, zizah Girls be talkin'|Like they all rah, rah Who's ready to kick|some sweaty man-butt? I've got my pointy|man-kicking shoes on. Those are cute. Aren't they?|I got them at Nine West. Simmer down, warriors.|Full power to the vagyroscope! Those dirty rings. I tried soaking them out,|even blasting them out. Are you sure about this? It would be better for propaganda|if we weren't using refined sugar. It's okay. The potato we're|shoving in the tailpipe is organic. I smell sabotage. And potatoes. Now, unfortunately, the media is|going to put a negative spin on this, like when we killed that guy, so to win public support,|we'll need a lovable mascot. Squirm all you want,|you nasty dumpling. One less species for the universe,|one more breakfast for... - Zoidberg?|- Leela. Me saving things the leech.|Not the eating of it. Zoidberg, I'm very surprised|at you, slightly. - Psst! Leela.|- Shh! I'm a fugitive. I know. I miss you so much, Leela,|even more than when you were here. I miss you, too, Fry. And you probably think|what I'm doing is wrong. But it's something|I really care about... You don't have to explain, Leela. You're you.|That's all I need to know. Goodbye, sweet goofbag. I'll miss her, too, buddy. - Dibs on her iPod.|- Dibs on... Hey, Fry! Long time, man. Hey, Hutch! What have you been up to? Same old, same old.|Searching the dumpsters, protecting my thoughts|with tin foil, peeing myself. So, what brings you to Earth? It's top secret. Hey, take off|your helmet and I'll think it to you. Okay. Here goes. Where are you? And me? The Great Hall of|the Ancient Legion of Madfellows. Welcome, bro. - Welcome, bro.|- Welcome, bro. Sorry I bashed your|head in, buddy, but I had to. You see, the fate of the|universe depends on you. - Yeah, I get that a lot.|- The Grand Curator will tell you more. Take me to him. - Hey, man.|- Hey. So dig this, Fry. Our commune has been|monitoring the universe's life energy for, like, a really long time,|and we're grokking some super weird junk. I don't mean to be rude, but it's|kind of hard to take you seriously when you say junk|like "grok" and "junk. " - What about "commune"?|- Especially "commune. " Come on, it's the fate of|the universe, puff it up a little. Like you could say|your ancient order is sensing deep upheaval in the|cosmic life energy field. Okay. I'll try. So, like,|a really, really long time ago... Eons ago! Cool. Eons ago, the life force we call|Chee permeated the universe. The Green Chee generated a great|upwelling of life across the cosmos. But then, for reasons unknown... Ooh. "Reasons unknown. " Now that's the sort of hook that|grabs the attention of me, the viewer. For reasons unknown... Nice. ...the Chee began to recede,|and the diversity of life began to wither. The life forms we know today are but a fraction of a fraction of|the magnificence that once existed. But a bunch of dudes, right, they totally passed this far-out|knowledge down through the ages. Some with|this knowledge were called prophets, some, fruitcakes. We, the Legion|of Madfellows, are their heirs. Hey, I'm on TV. - Well, that's the show.|- Neat. What's it got to do with me? Pooperdoodle!|I mean, pardon the omission. You see, after untold eternities,|we have sensed a resurgence in the Chee. Hey, that's the violet dwarf star|that Leela wants to save. Freaking nailed it, corndog. We believe this star|heralds a new green age, and it's your destiny to be|its shepherd and protector. Me? Why? 'Cause you got, like,|no delta brainwave, man. The Dark Ones can't|groove off your thoughts. Silence, Hutch!|You shall learn more in time, Fry. But for now,|let's just say we have enemies, enemies who can read|minds, except yours. Cool. I can't wait to tell Leela. No! If you tell anyone,|then their thoughts could be read, and our enemies would|know of our existence. For the sake of those you love,|you must keep this secret. - Do you foot-swear?|- Okay. I foot-swear. Good. Now, to save the|coming of the green age, you must stop this man. I know him. Leo Wong.|I work with his daughter. Good, that will cut about|15 minutes of explanation. You must gain Wong's confidence,|infiltrate his organization and prevent him from|destroying the violet dwarf. - Looking for a job, eh?|- Yes, sir. Nothing fancy. I'm willing to start at|the bottom and infiltrate my way up. Sorry, no openings right now. What I need is security guard to|keep nutcases out of my office. - I'm good at keeping nutcases.|- I said no way. Security guard gotta be tough. This idiot don't look like|he could handle those feministas. I look like an idiot who|can handle those feministas. He'll have to do better than that. I'll have to do better than that. Hmm. You and I think a lot alike. You really think you can|stand up to those eco-freakos? Sir, with me around,|they'll be the least of your worries. Stand by, men. And manly aliens.|Prepare to test fire King Kong hole. It workses. Good job, men. And manly aliens. Construction of|King Kong hole complete. Typical.|Always King Kong, never Queen Quong. What are those, hooks?|Get out of heres, you hookers. This is my turfs. Helpses! You go, gorilla! Our top story.|The string of eco-vandalism that began with a harmless|vice-presidential killing has spread across the galaxy. Why do you always get to|read the top story, Morbo? Because viewers trust a deep male|voice and huge, throbbing forehead veins. Not all reaction to the crime|spree has been negative. We spoke with several people who viewed|these courageous eco-feminists as heroes. I just wish there was|some way to... Excuse me. Some way to show I support 'em.|Send them some smokes or something. So you make more than|twice what I do. What? This just in: Root 2 News has|received a video communique from the eco-feminists'|unknown hideout. This is sub-commander L., den mother of the|Feminista Revolutionary Collective, with a message for Leo Wong. Leo, you're a parasite on the universe,|and parasites must be destroyed. That's why we've adopted|this parasite as our mascot. I know it's a little confusing. The point is, even this|vicious leech has a right to exist, because it's a part of nature. And that's why a vicious leech|like Leo Wong must be exterminated. Again, confusing. We call on women|everywhere to join our struggle against eco-chauvinist Leo Wong. We especially need|good communique writers. Feministas unite! - In other news...|- Feministas unite! Feministas unite! Incredible. Absolutely incredible. You're telling me this TiVo machine|can pause and rewind live TV? These crazy broads|gonna ruin me, Nixon. You gotta help me.|Send the army or something. Something big that shoots. Sir, I don't care if you|are my biggest contributor. Our armed forces do not serve|your private business interests. Sorry, I... I'm just yanking your chain, Leo.|I'm on it like boring on Gerry Ford. Zapp Brannigan purporting for duty. For the love of God, Kif,|less piccolo, more fife. Report, Brannigan. Mr. President, I failed to identify|these curvaceous banditas despite hours of staring|at their dossiers. Yet, I seemed to have|stroked myself upon good luck, for a patriot of the highest order|has volunteered to lead us to them. These eco-feminists|are ruthless criminals who'll stop at nothing|to save the environment. I don't see how|a bending unit can catch them. Not just any bending unit,|Presidente. I happen to be brilliant,|fearless and short on cash. Short on cash. Slush him, Kroker. Bender here has identified the femdito|commander as my ex-lover, Turanga Leela, whom I once made love at. And he's willing to fink|her out for a few simoleons? It's not about the money, Nixon,|though I'd like much more. It's 'cause Leela's a threat.|A threat to my reputation. She's committed 30 felonies|in 12 star systems. If no one stops her, she'll break|my record for longest rap sheet. That's a despicable motive,|Bender, and I respect it. Now, I could find Leela, but|you'll need to authorize a wiretap. - As many as you like.|- I only need one. Let's call it six. Question. If you don't know where|Leela is, how can you wiretap her? I'm not wiretapping her,|Greensleeves. You see, like all women,|Leela has one weakness. Hello, weakness! Hey, Bender, check it out.|I'm Leo Wong's new security guard. I got an ID badge and a flashlight,|and I ordered this mustache. Neat. Say, speaking of|whatever the hell you just said, I need to make a cell|phone telephone call. Can borrow your|cell phone telephone? Okay, but don't|restart my Tetris. I was finally about|to get one of those pieces that looks like a backwards "L." Okay, superstud. Looking good, security.|No feministas getting past you. No, sir. Not on my|mustache's watch. Fry, I can't believe you're working|with my dad against Leela. How can you claim to be|her friend and still want her in jail? It's a tightrope walk,|I won't deny it. It takes the kind of multi-sided|thinking your dad's so brilliant at. - You mean being two-faced?|- Don't mind cranky-pants here. She been cranky ever since|she was a fat little girl. Dad! Can I be brutally honest, Fry?|I always wanted a son. That hurt, but I can take it. I knew you wanted a son! Why do you think I became|a miniature golf champion? Why do you think I wear|these stupid boys' sweat suits? To hide your|big, fat butt, that's why. Now, sir, in fairness,|Amy's butt is actually pretty hot. What is it with you men? Why does everything|revolve around my butt? 'Cause it's so big and massive. - Sorry.|- That's it! Why don't you just adopt Fry and|make him the son you never had? That'll replace the daughter|you don't have anymore! Whoa! What's with Big Butt? She just hungry. - Here you go, Fry.|- Thanks. Oh! FYI, I dropped that Tetris piece in|the wrong place and ended the game. No! Great! Now Amy's gonna|tell Leela I'm a jerk. If only I could explain|I'm on a secret mission against evil. Wait. Evil? Yeah, yeah, evil. What's going on in there?|A scary noise? Hey, you're one of|Leela's feministas. "Save the environment!|Wo-mandate Leo's retirement!" That's terrible writing!|Stop making your point so ineffectively! Take your mands off of me! I'm on your side. Don't shush me. Please, can you take|a message to Leela? What is it? Just say her sweet goofbag is working to|save the violet dwarf star, just like she is. Very well,|I'll fem-municate your man-formation. Just tell her. Well, this is it, old friends.|Planet Express is done for, what with our|delivery crew missing and the abysmal sales|of Tickle Me Bender. Quit touching my junk, pervert! Hold out your hands|and I'll remove your career chips. I hate to see it come to an end. When will it end? Shouldn't you get that, Professor? I suppose. Hello? Professor, old buddy, I'm gonna blow up|the violet dwarf star. So I need you deliver|billion-mile security fence to keep out protesters.|Dirty business. Lot of money. You corrupt enough? Damn skippy! Good news, crybabies!|We're back in business. Sweet kookaburra of Edinburgh, Professor.|You sure you know how to fly this thing? I invented it, didn't I?|You wouldn't ask Thomas Edison whether he knew|how to use a sexmatron. The feministas, probably. Halt! What are you doing|in this parallelogram of space? We're delivering a fence to|keep you ladies in your place. - Amy?|- Labarbara? That's right, husband. From now on, you make|your own Manwiches. Under the articles of the confemiracy,|we hereby wo-mandeer this ship. Oh, no, you don't.|It's three against three. That was the greatest play I ever saw.|It must have had 20 acts. We installed your fence, Leo Wong. - Yeah!|- Yeah! Should we shout a clever slogan? You mean something like,|"The best defense is a good fence?" Yeah, something|like that, only funny. I wish we could, but our chief slogan writer is|back at the Honeybun Hideout. Does "violet dwarf" rhyme|with "men are dorks"? It does through a megaphone. That reminds me, I've got to|tell Leela about that weirdo who wants to save|the violet dwarf. So, the Legion|of Madfellows has a new pawn, eh? Is somebody here? If you're the DSL guy,|you're two days late. Who gave you that message for Leela? I don't know his name. Then you are of no use to the Dark Ones! Long lost brother, avenge my death. Where are your crappy|rhymes now, Frida Waterfall? I'm dead. I'm dead. Eat only natural whole-grain bread. Six, seven, eight|Lock the gate One, two, three|Turn the key 30, 50, 10 - My dirty, shifty friend?|- Hey, Fry, long time. Welcome back to the|Legion of Madfellows, man. Why'd you bonk me, you idiot? You could have just|asked me to come with you. And where are we? This doesn't|look like your regular dumpster. All in good time! I guess now is a good time. We are on Mars,|in a forgotten cavern abandoned by the native|Martians a million years ago. Actually, it was five years ago.|I remember 'cause they washed my socks. You have done well, Fry. You have ingratiated|yourself with Leo Wong. Yup, I kissed his ass|from cheek to shining cheek. So, what do I do next? As Wong security chief, you will be on hand when|he attempts to destroy the violet dwarf. You must not let that happen. "Must let happen. " Not happen! "Must let occur. " Let me tell you a story.|A story of two alien species so ancient that compared to them|the human race is a mere college senior! On a distant planetoid they evolved|to cooperate in their quest to survive. Cooperation, because|life is a team sport. But, over time,|one species evolved a better strategy, and an evolutionary arms race began. That concludes the audio-visual|portion of our head-clonk and lecture. Wait, what happened|to the snakes and the frogs? I need to know! The frogs, or possibly the snakes,|evolved into vicious killing machines, honed by the merciless forces of|natural selection and intelligent design. We call these the Dark Ones! These evil creatures preyed on all life,|driving species after species to extinction. Meanwhile, however, the second species evolved|to fend off the Dark Ones, befriending and protecting|all other living things. - Even Celine Dion?|- Probably. We call these noble|beings the Encyclopods, because their DNA incorporates the DNA of every endangered|species they encountered, so they can recreate|them if they go extinct. Just as a pillow, a wig and a corncob pipe|can be used to recreate my old girlfriend! Bingo. Meanwhile, at the Honeybun Hideout. There! Now you know how it feels|to be locked up in a go-go cage. What the hell are you talking about? Shut your man-hole. I feel dirty. Are you sure Fry is|working for your father? It just doesn't seem like him to|be so evil, or to hold down a job. It's true, Leela.|Cross My Heart bra and swear to Goddess. But the Fry I know|wouldn't do that. I'm gonna call his cell phone|telephone and prove you wrong. Oh, no! Frida's been murdered! Sweet she-cattle of Seattle. Not your|strong suit, woman. Who could have done this? Your dad? Nixon? Fry? No, never. I don't think. Anyhow, there's a crazed|murderer on the loose, possibly in the shadows|or hanging from the ceiling. So just stay calm while I call Fry. So where are the Encyclopods|and the Dark Ones now? When the life-giving|Chee receded, only the toughest organisms|could adapt and survive, like the Dark Ones. Many more died out,|like the Encyclopods. But, and this is the|great secret of our age, we believe they|left an egg behind. - Is it edible?|- We're not gonna eat it! Not unless we find a second one.|No, Fry, we intend to hatch it! And that's where you come in. And here I am. At long last the tide|of Chee has returned, and its nourishing flow|has awakened the dormant egg. That's good. It's better than good. It's better.|With its massive stash of DNA, the Encyclopod can reconstruct|every species that ever went extinct. Imagine, all the animals that|failed evolution's test, alive again! The dodo bird, the brittle-klutz,|the striped biologist-taunter. - So, where is this egg?|- In the violet dwarf star system. - And what does it look like?|- A violet dwarf star! You mean, the whole star|is a single... Whoa! Sci-fi. Alas! Even now, a Dark One is headed|to the star to ensure its destruction. Dang! So what does|this Dark One look like? We don't know. I admit|it's a horrifically grave situation. Don't sugarcoat it, Nine. The Dark Ones have|been evolving so long, it could be anything or anyone. Or anybody. You mean, like, people? Any people. It will kill the egg, and every dude, woman|and child who knows about it. Even our crazy caps will|be useless at close range. That's why only you, with your|defective unreadable brainwave, may be able to thwart them and usher in a new|green age of wonder and... You're on Fry-time. Leela! - Did you get my message?|- What message? Didn't you see Frida Waterfall? So you did|kill Frida Waterfall? What? No. I told her|to tell you that I'm... Oh, Jeep! The Dark Ones|got her. It's all true. We need to talk, Leela.|Then I can explain... Well, I can't explain anything,|but we should talk anyway. - Where are you?|- Oh, no. I'm not gonna expose|the Honeybun Hideout. Where are you? Near the Keeler Crater on Mars.|Do you know it? I think I read about it. I'll meet you at the south|rim in one hour. No mustaches. Kif, set coordinates, 36-24-36. AKA, Leela. Ten minutes late.|Ain't that just like a womanista? - Are you alone?|- Of course, don't you trust me? There's no escape, Leela. If you surrender,|wave your shirt in the air. Fry, you traitor! Hop onto|the magnet, Leela! Okay. One, two... I can't believe you|ratted me out, Fry. I'm not a rat, I swear. If I'm any rodent, it's the loyal|capybara, king of the rats! No, wait. This just in, we are about|to get our asses blown off. - Labarbara?|- That's right, Linda. Stay strong, ladies. We can lose them|in the giant miniature golf course. But the course isn't finished.|And there's no girls allowed. Fore! So, they want to play mini golf, eh?|Two can play at that game. Or even four, depending on|the number of ball colors available. - I choose pink.|- That's their color, sir. The hell it is. They're gaining on us.|We need a birdie on the windmill hole. Wait. Wait. Drop the boot! Sir, at our present speed, the computer predicts|a 100% chance we'll be sliced in half. We'll never make it. Not with that attitude, we won't.|Same speed ahead! We made it through, Kif.|How many men did we lose? All of them. Well, at least they won't|have to mourn each other. Seal the airlocks,|and draw the shades. Resume shooting. Oh, no! The gorilla! That's a par-four! The mouth's too dangerous.|I'm going for the nose. Don't be a sucker. You won't|come out anywhere near the hole. You need to aim for the jaws|just when they start to close. Start to close?|Are you out of your... We made it! Captaining 101. Go for the nose. My arms are broken,|I'll never paint again. You can't sue the military. I'm okay then. Damage report. We lost all remaining|food and oxygen, Captain. As well as our XM Radio antenna. Then this chase is over. Kif, set course|for the nearest XM repair facility. Meanwhile, we shall|sing top hits from the '80s. Which '80s, sir? For me, there are only one '80s. Smell like I sound|I'm lost and I'm found And I'm hungry like the wolf The shot was too good!|We're jamming straight for the hole. We're gonna crash, even. Shmeesh, shmill out,|shmeverybody. It's a wormhole hole. Of course, a wormhole!|We'll simply disappear and reappear in another part of the universe. We made it! Crud nuggets!|We de-spaced right next to the Nimbus. Just when you think the chase|is over, it gets twice as exciting! Hey, look at that. Well, well, well. My bloodhound-like instincts|must have hunted them down while my other parts|were throbbing to Duran Duran. Shall I initiate a pointless|and potentially fatal pursuit? Make it so. It's gonna be fun on a bun, in space. Look! The asteroid.|Now it's crawling with life. Like Zoidberg's sandals! Wow! It's incredible. But it'll be destroyed when|Leo Wong blows up the violet dwarf. - So why are you helping him?|- I can't tell you, Leela. You just have to trust me. You keep saying that, but you have to give me|something to go on or I... Out of whale oil. Out of whale oil. The out-of-fuel indicator. It's indicating. Say, what's that violet-colored|dwarf-like star thing we're drifting into? The violet dwarf star! Of course. The gorilla was the 18th hole,|so we're headed into the ball return. What else now can go wrong? Ladies, you're under arrest.|Prepare to be boarded again and again. He'll never take me alive. Don't give up yet.|I've got one more trick up my sleeve. That's exactly the number we need. The fairer sex. Something's very wrong here,|and yet a little bit right. Not so fast, Brannigan. Even less fast, feministas! Bender? All two tons of me. Oye, oye, oye. All rise for the honorable Chief Justice|D-O-G-G and the Associate Justices. Yo. Seat it or beat it. The charges against|y'all femditos is murder, mayhem, vandalism,|kidnapping and resisting arrest. Damn! The big five. You may now make your opening.|What you got to say for yourselves? May it please the Court... I mean, may it plizzle the cozizzle. - Proceed.|- These charges are outrageous. Our only goal was to save a rare|violet star and its precious ecosystem. If protecting the environment is a crime,|then... Protecting the environment is a crime. I rest my mouth. Do you swear to tell the whole|truth and nothing but the truth? I... Well, now, I... Am I under|oath when I take the oath? Can the witness identify|the feminista leader? That's her right there, with the "I'm gonna kill|you Bender" look in her eye. Hey, aren't you the robot who|robbed me at gunpoint last year? No further answers, Your Honor. Please, Justice Dogg, Leela and|her friends are completely innocent. Hold up. Were you or were|you not abducted by these hoes? Well, abducted is such an ugly word. Mr. Wong, the court cannot compel you|to testify against your own daughter. No. No, I want to. Also, I got|something to say about my wife. Aw, yeah. Having heard some of the testimony|over these jams I've been listening to, me and my crew will|now kick it in the mix. All right. We got us|a verdict up in this High Court. Bailiff, drop it like|it's legal precedent. In the matter of Leo Wong v.|The Greenorita Eco-Feminist Collective, four justices vote to convict,|five to acquit. However, since the vote was|strictly along gender lines and the female justices' votes only|count half, you are hereby found guilty. It's a humiliating and biased system,|but it works. Fifty years in the maximum|security Dogg house. Peace. - Ladies! Welcome to hell.|- Beats Nutley on a Saturday night. This is a privately-owned for-profit prison,|and I run a tight, cheap ship! I've done this by cutting cost everywhere,|especially on punishment. I rely on you inmates to make|prison unpleasant for yourselves. You're encouraged to|sexually harass new prisoners, organize no-holds-barred|catfights and maintain poor hygiene. Try and make me, copper. A troublemaker. Taste the lash of my|99-cent-store nightstick! Yee-ha! With the feministas in|jail, it full speed ahead. You and me, Fry. We implode|the violet dwarf star tomorrow. Ka-boom-boom. - You and me?|- Yeah. - Tomorrow?|- Tomorrow. - Ka-boom?|- Ka-boom-boom. Hello? Madfellows? I need to... Okay, Leo Wong's about to|destroy the violet dwarf. So, whatever I need to know|to stop him, tell me now. Alas! Stopping Wong|isn't the only problem. One of the Dark Ones will try to|stop you from stopping him. So, you must stop it from|stopping you from stopping him. But how can I stop|it stop me stop him? Stop it! Behold,|the Omega Device. That's it? The name "Omega Device" sort of|conjured up something cooler-looking. Not that I'm disappointed or anything. The important thing is what's inside. - What does that look like?|- No one knows, man. It was invented|by a blind inventor, and the one dude he|described it to was deaf. So the legend goes. When activated, the device will emit|a localized blast of delta-band noise to momentarily|disable the Dark One. - Like farting in a tent?|- No, an elevator. Which is why you must|strike the enemy at point blank range! But the Dark One could|look like anything or anyone, right? Or anywhere. So, what's your plan to recognize it? - We don't have one.|- Got it. And we don't dare|think of one neither. 'Cause if we do, the Dark Ones|might sense kind of the general vibe. Even through our mighty foil. Oh, man!|Anyone got some tape or some gum? As my colleague indicated,|the plan cannot come from us, Fry. We were counting on you and your unreadable brain|to come up with something. - That was a mistake.|- I see that now. Freaky thing is, the Dark Ones'|thoughts are unreadable, just like yours. Yes, if we dared unwrap our heads, we could easily locate the one other being|whose mind we can't read. The Dark One! But then the Dark One|would read our minds and crush them|like blood pumpkins. Wait. I can read minds|and my mind can't be read. - I have a plan.|- Great. Whatever it is, don't tell us. Wait. Fry can read minds|and his mind can't be read. So he can safely|scan for the Dark One... Shut up! Shut up! Leela, time is running out.|We must get to the violet star. Okay, okay. Shut up, already. Huh? Nobody's talking, Leela. We're just painting each other's|toenails with rat blood. Lights out, ladies! Those compact fluorescent|bulbs waste pennies a day. Okay, feministas, all clear. Whoa! We now go live to Leela|with the escape plan. - Leela?|- Thanks, Linda. Now we're in here because we|tried to save endangered wildlife. So this time,|endangered wildlife will save us. The Martian muck leech. That's right. He's been living|off me since we got captured. Little cutie almost sucked me dry. Look at him go. Like a green snake|through a sugarcane cake. Keep trying. Our top story. The universe's most wanted|eco-feminists are now behind bars, including gang leader, Turanga Leela.|AKA, the Notorious B-I-Itch. We finished un-pinking|the ship, Hubert. Now what? Now we get back to work. And if that means destroying|an ecosystem or two, so be it. I just meant without our good|friends Fry, Leela, Amy and the robot. Oh, boo-hoo. This is a business,|not a social club. Money talks. True wealth is|measured in friendships. Shut up, you. Life goes on. But I believe we'll forever|carry the pain on the inside. Oh, no, a rooster!|That indicates it's the following morning. How's that creepy crawler doing? I'm sorry, femi-sisters,|but it pooped out around 3:00 a. m. Poor thing couldn't take another bite. Well, I guess we failed. But what matters is, we tried our|best and we looked good doing it. Bender, is that you? Who does it look like?|My identical cousin Buster? Yes. You're here to break us out?|But you're the one who put us in. But I'm Bender,|king of the combination shot. I put you in so that by busting you out,|I could commit 15 felonies at once. Put my rap sheet miles ahead|of yours on the all-time chart. You are one devious bastard. That's what it says on my vanity plate. - What about the sentries?|- Already taken care of. I sent them a cake laced with nutmeg.|That's a human sleeping drug, right? No, it's a human baking drug. Okay, Plan B. Everyone knows|men have one fatal weakness, they can't resist hookers.|Dixie, Trixie, you know what to do. Hello, boys! Your eyes say no,|but your machine gun fire says... Ladies and gentleman|and whatever, welcome to my most environmentally|disastrous implosion ever. A whole star system! Kif, old boy, mind if I sit on|your shoulders for a better view? Well, actually, sir, I was hoping... Thanks. My associate Philip Fry here will have|honor to blow this ugly, dirty star into nice, clean black hole. Fry, careful those wires.|What you doing down there? Just polishing your shoes, Mr. W. That nice. Get between|the toes there, very dirty. Well, so much for Plan B. What's Plan C? All situations have the same Plan C.|Bending, come on. We're boned, Bender.|It's a brick wall. Granted, it's not on|the list of approved bendables, but I'm so great! Dogs! The boning continues. Green Bluebird, this is Mr. Fabulous.|We are go for cheesing it. Professor! Hermes! Zoidberg! Scruffy. A janitor. You helped us escape? Even after we locked you in a go-go|cage like common go-go dancers? I couldn't live with myself, Leela.|I call myself a scientist, wear the white coat and probe|a monkey every now and again, yet I put monetary gain|ahead of preserving nature. Can you ever forgive me? I reckon. - I could kiss you, Professor.|- Okay, but watch out for my new grill. Before the grand finale, as it were, it seems only fitting that I,|Commodore 64 Zapp Brannigan, say a few brief pages in honor of... Whatever your plan is,|Fry, I suggest you get on with it. Get... Shoot, I got hot|sauce on my Number 9 shirt. Okay, locate the Dark One by finding|someone whose thoughts I can't read. And unaccustomed... By God!|I'm the greatest speaker of all time. They're suckling at the|teats of my every syllable. Allow me now... His voice is like ear sandpaper.|I miss Amy. The one secret|no one ever suspected is that I really did|stage the moon landing. On Venus. If I had all the money|in the world, I'd... Oh, wait. I do. I'd like to thank the academy,|my agent, and most of all, my operating system,|Windows Vista, for everything it... System error. Naked ladies. Naked ladies.|Naked ladies. Naked ladies. I never should have taken that accent|elimination class from Jackie Chan. And so, as we obliterize this star, let us remember those immortal words|once spoken by a great man, moi. And I quote, "All good|things must come to an end, "preferably in|a humongous explosion. " Let's pop this beach ball. Ten! Nine! Eight! There's no one here whose|thoughts can't be read. No one, except me! My thoughts can't be read.|But that's crazy. If I were the Dark One,|I'd know it, wouldn't I? But, here I am, right where|the Dark One would be, about to blow up the star. Oh, God! Somewhere deep|inside of me, it's me! I'm the Dark One! Put your hands in the air! Should we wave them|like we just don't care? That's optional. You girl punks gone too far this time.|Your parents should be ashamed. Yes, you should! - Amy?|- Amy! Destroy the star, Leo, hurry. You got it, Mr. Voice-in-my-head. I've gotta admit, Amy,|you got a pretty good swing. Really? Thanks, Dad. Okay, time to defuse|this star cracker once and for all. Leela, wait.|You're making a mistake. You have no idea|what's really going on. What is really going on? I can't tell you. Then why should I trust you? Why? Because... Because... You're you. That's all I need to know. - No! Don't do it!|- Fiddlesticks. Leela, are you crazy? We became fugitives|and jail-breakers to stop him. And hookers, don't forget hookers. Shame on all of you. After everything we've been through|together, do you really think Fry would... Goodbye, Leela.|I destroy myself to save you. Where's the boom?|I was expecting a boom. It didn't work. I'm the Dark One,|and it didn't do anything. You're not the Dark One, I am. Leela? Not Leela, you moron. Me! What did you do to me? Ew! I am the Dark One.|The very last Dark One. How is it possible|I couldn't read your mind? Oh, I am momentarily disabled. What's happening out there? Somethings wondersful. The star and the asteroid.|They were an egg and a sperm. Great modem of mercy.|Cover the children's eyes. There are no children here. Then move your fat head.|I can't see. The Encyclopod is reborn.|A new green age has begun! So the legend foretold. Look! Inside its pouch.|Extinct Tasmanian tigers. And dodo birds.|And white rhinos. And striped biologist-taunters. What are you gonna do, shoot us? Life! These once extinct plants|and animals are my gift to the universe. Through untold generations,|my race has treasured their DNA. Treat them wisely with the knowledge|that all species are precious. This is unbelievable. What's going on? To answer that, I must tell you a story. A story of two alien|species so ancient that... - Hutch, are you okay?|- My sister's femi-necklace. What? Hey, how come I can't|read your thoughts anymore? I shall avenge you, Hutch Waterfall. After all these eons,|the Dark Ones are no more. Will you preserve their|DNA, O Great Encyclopod? I suppose I should.|Wait, where did it go? What? Well, at any rate, I shall|preserve the DNA of Homo sapiens. I thought you only saved the|DNA of endangered species. Farewell. I guess he didn't hear me. Well, looks like that wraps everything|up in a nice big, old, fat sack of... I hereby arrest you|fugitives on 53 counts of fugivity. Kif, round them up,|and spare me the weary sigh for once. Kif. Wait for me. Well, this is the end. There was so|many things I wanted to say to you. Like what? Like this is not the end.|But mostly just, I love you, Leela. Maybe I waited too long to say this,|but I love you, too. Wormhole! Sweet topology of|cosmology, it's huge! If we fly into it, it could take|us trillions of light years away. There's no knowing if we'll ever return. What do we do?|Should we go for it? Into the breach, meatbags.|Or not. Whatever. Go, go, go, go,|go, go, go, go, go, go. Go, go, go, go, go,|go, go, go, go, go.
