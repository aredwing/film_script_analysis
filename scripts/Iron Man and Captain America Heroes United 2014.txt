Lethal force is authorized. (GRUNTS) (LASER FIRING) RED SKULL: Captain America. Super soldier. (GRUNTS) One of the greatest leaders, combatants and tacticians who ever lived. The only thing I hate more than hydra soldiers are hydra robots. (GROANS) (GRUNTS) He was once a normal man. Did we get him? Where is he? (GROANS) Fire! A weakling, who took the experimental super soldier serum. That man became unstoppable. Coupled with his unbreakable shield. (ALL GROAN) Trained in dozens of fighting styles. He is the pinnacle of human potential. One of the toughest warriors of the modern age. An allied hero in world war ii, he'd battled the forces of hydra with some success, until he fought his superior. With the fate of the globe hanging in the balance, their battle ended in a draw. CAPTAIN AMERICA: Hey! (GRUNTS) When their plane went down in the ice, they were frozen. Revived only recently. Well? His skills are extraordinary. Difficult to copy, but not impossible. So says the taskmaster. Don't worry, red skull. My photographic reflexes can mimic anyone, even him. Mimicking him and defeating him are two very different things. I believe a test is in order. (WEAPONS FIRING) That was a test? Well done, taskmaster. But captain America is more than skill. It is his focus, will, and mind that make him who he is. Sounds like somebody's got a little man-crush there, red... (CHOCKING) The captain and I are two sides of the same coin. Do not underestimate him, or me. You've seen my skill. You know what I can do. Emulating captain America isn't enough for my final goal. I need the super soldier himself. TASKMASTER: Leave it to me. RED SKULL: That's not all. Another avenger possesses something I require. Iron man. Stark? Tony stark? What do you want with that rich fame ball? I don't want the man. I want his weapons. I've been preparing for iron man as well. I know all his weaknesses. I am not convinced you can take on two avengers alone. So I've prepared reinforcements. ALL: (CHANTING) Hail hydra! Hail the red skull! Hail hydra! Hail the red skull! Soon you will see what sets me apart from captain America, when I rule this world! IRON MAN: You sure about this, cap? I mean, I've got the world's most highly advanced repulsor-powered armor and you've got... No offense, a glorified trash can lid. Look, I don't wanna hurt you. Did you say trash can lid? (GRUNTS) Ah! Wait a second, I didn't say go! In combat, you can't always be the one who says go! That's your problem, stark, you never strategize. You just wing it. (FIRING) It's called thinking on your feet. Or in my case, boot jets. I adapt to the unexpected by being unpredictable. You, on the other hand, are super predictable. You used that same move on the wrecking crew last week. (GRUNTS) Whoa! Ouch! Worked both times, didn't it? Yeah, but do you got anything new? (LASER FIRING) I'm pretty sure you haven't seen this one. Pretty sure I have. (GRUNTS) Well, then stop it! Okay, you got me. But if I had really cut loose, you'd be toast by now. Well, then don't hold back. Your suit's a great weapon, stark, but trust me, it can be a crutch. A crutch? This time, I won't hold back. And to make it interesting, how about a little bet? When I win, you have to wear my armor for a month. And don't worry, I got one in your colors. Well, I don't need a stuffy sardine can, but okay. However, when I win, you go to boot camp training with me. And I hope you like push-ups, Tony. I see a lot of 'em in your future. I usually hire someone to do push-ups for me, but you know what, you're on! All right, Jarvis. Let's turn old red, white and blue into plain old black and blue. JARVIS: If you say so. CAPTAIN AMERICA: You wanna say go this time, stark? IRON MAN: Very funny. On your mark, get-set-go! (LASER FIRING) (GRUNTS) Nice one. Block this! You're making it easy! (SHIELD CLANKS) So are you! Oh, really? Give up? JARVIS: Captain America has damaged several quantum dot nanocircuits. Power is down by 15%. No sweat. Watch this. (SHIELD CLANKING) See? This is what I'm talking about. All armor, no skill. Don't need your skill when my weapons can do this! (EXPLOSION) CAPTAIN AMERICA: You need to use your most important weapon, your brain, more often. Hey bucko, you're talking to the guy who can divide quintic polynomials in his head while trimming his nose hairs! (GRUNTS) Ah! So keep your left up and guard those pretty nose hairs. You've made your point. So, now I'm gonna make mine and win this! (GRUNTS) (CLANKS) CAPTAIN AMERICA: Fine. We'll call it a draw. IRON MAN: For now. Just another little tweak and... JARVIS: Repulsors are at 100%, sir. How's the repair going on your fancy suit? It's just minor adjustments. I'm ready any time! My armor can go all day. The best shouldn't have to. That was the whole point, huh? You didn't want to spar. You wanted to train me. You're my friend, Tony. And I want to keep you alive. Having repulsor-powered armor is one thing. Being an undisciplined wild man in battle will get you killed. Believe me, I've seen it before. I get it. And thanks, Steve. But my ability to fly by the seat of my pants is who I am. There'd be no iron man without it. (EXPLOSION) WHOA! WHAT? JARVIS: Sir. (ALARM RINGING) We're under attack! Jarvis, a little help here? JARVIS: Intruders, sir. They have infiltrated our defense grid. Who are they? Jarvis system shutting down. (EXPLOSION) Huh? CAPTAIN AMERICA: What are they after? They're headed for my weapons vault! Let's move! Right behind, ya! IRON MAN: Try to keep up. How'd you get ahead of me? Quiet. HYDRA TROOPER: Prep these weapons for transport immediately! Hydra. Okay, here's what we'll do. Wait! Hey! Do you have any idea how much I hate it when people touch my stuff? (WEAPONS FIRING) Blast him! The nerve of these guys! (ALL GROAN) How's that for an entrance? (WEAPONS FIRING) I had an idea. We could have taken them all out in 10 seconds flat! Did you not see them ransacking my toy chest? (CAPTAIN AMERICA GRUNTS) Behind you! Got it! These guys are no problem, cap! CAPTAIN AMERICA: Unless they get a hold of a giant gun! Die, heroes! IRON MAN: I'll handle it. Eventually. (WEAPONS FIRING) (ALL GROAN) (GRUNTS) (GRUNTS) Hurry, Dr. cruler. Haste makes waste. I'm hacking as fast as I can, Dr. fump. Almost. Got it. There! We've breached the magnetic seal, we're in. Help me with the transport case! Oh, no. Not in there! Cap! Thanks. They're in the vault. We gotta stop 'em! (WEAPONS FIRING) DR. FUMP: There it is. The stark repulsor Cannon. Powered by its very own arc reactor. Still a prototype, but incredibly valuable. (BEEPING) Report. What is your status? We've got the repulsor Cannon. Where are you, sir? You were supposed to be helping against iron man and captain America. Give me that! Our hydra troopers are facing two avengers! We need your help! I gave you the tools to aid in your escape. Now, return to base! I don't think I like him. (BOTH GRUNT) Wait. Was this part of the plan? (BOTH SCREAM) (CHUCKLES) Those hydra fools don't even realize they're simply a diversion for a bigger prize. (GRUNTS) (WEAPONS FIRING) So how about that bet? By my count I took down one more than you did. (CLANKS) And by my count we're even. And we've got a lot of cleaning up to do. IRON MAN: We'll get 'em to the brig after we've accounted for all my weapons, including the ones in the vault. Oh, no. No! I should've known. What is it? The stark repulsor Cannon, my latest invention, it's gone! That Cannon is just as powerful as my hand-repulsors. Which means? Hydra's in possession of one of my deadliest weapons. I'm going after it. Let's not be hasty, Tony. We need a plan. IRON MAN: I don't have time for a plan! And I don't have flying boots to chase after you with. Uh... Wake up. I want answers. Where are you taking that repulsor Cannon? Where? Forget it, hero. I'll never talk. Hail hydra. Hail the red... (SCREAMING) (ALL SCREAMING) What? What's going on? Where am I? Who am I? Oh, good grief. What is this place? I'm freaking out, man! Iron man, come in. Iron man! Let's get out of here. Com's jammed. Great. Let's hope there's a way off this tub. I don't think stark will mind if I borrow one of his expensive jets. That one doesn't belong to stark. You've got some of hawkeye's skill, but you're not him. Hawkeye doesn't miss. If I wanted to hit you, I would have. I've studied all of the avengers' skills. Especially yours, captain. Taskmaster. I've read your file. I know all about your talents. Let's see you imitate this! Okay, you're a little better than I expected. (BOTH GRUNTING) Give it up, captain. I possess the techniques of the greatest fighters in the world. (GROANS) Like iron fist! My improv catch you off guard, taskmaster? Oh, great. Now I sound like stark! Hold still, avenger! (GRUNTS) So predictable. Oh, yeah? (GRUNTS) Okay, nice. Kenpo, tae Kwon do and jujitsu. My turn! How'd you like my judo? I don't! It's him! It's iron man! Do something! Ugh. Take the controls! Eat this! IRON MAN: Now this is the part where I escort you to the ground. (WEAPON FIRING) You hydra goon! That's my weapon! And I'm coming to take it back! Note to self. Next time I create a weapon that can penetrate my force field, upgrade my force field! Ah! Even through my armor, this hurts. (GRUNTS) Hydra has big plans for you, hero, but to me, you're just a paycheck. Well, it's not gonna be easy money. (GROANS) TASKMASTER: Not bad. Wait a sec, the weight's off! What did you... (SCREAMING) I'm faster than you think, captain. Not only do I know your fighting style, I know exactly when you're going to throw your shield. And that you always catch it. IRON MAN: Come on. Don't poop out on me now. Whoa! (IRON MAN GROANS) (CLANKING) At least today can't get any worse. IRON MAN: Cap, you there? Hydra got away with... Cap? He's offline. Jarvis, are you back on or what? JARVIS: Back online, sir! Get me a trace on cap, asap. JARVIS: No GPS location, sir. All of captain Roger's com devices are offline, and his bio-signs are not present on the ship. IRON MAN: Well, then where is he? You check the hangar? None of your aircraft are missing. So if cap didn't leave, that means he was taken. The question is, where? Easy, troops. Don't want to harm our prize. He's worth a lot to me. Take him to the neurotransducer room for processing. Keep a guard on him at all times. BOTH: Yes, sir! Make that five guards. Oh, today is turning out to be an excellent day indeed. Now for my own prize. Iron man's stealth suit. Ah! I've studied all of hydra's manuals on the iron man armor. With this suit and my skills, I won't have to work for jerks like the skull anymore. Yeah, once I get rid of old red and crusty, I'll take over hydra and rule this weak world. (SCREAMING) Booby trapped. I should've known. Ah. (ALARM SOUNDING) AUTOMATED VOICE: Perimeter breach, incoming vessel. Ah, speak of the devil. Taskmaster. Where is he? TASKMASTER: That's right, red skull. I did what you've dreamed of all of these years. I give you captain America. (GROANS) RED SKULL: Impressive, taskmaster. You've executed your mission and brought me all I need to create a new army. (PANTING) New army? What, you two skull heads can't take over the world alone? Our soldiers will be superior to any this world has known. And you are vital to their creation. I've finally synthesized and even improved upon the super soldier serum that created you. Your blood is the last ingredient I needed. I could've got his blood. Plenty of it. Bringing him here was a mistake. You just got lucky, taskmaster. Luck had nothing to do with it. My mimicry power is unmatched. True. That is why we have utilized your unique ability in the functioning of our new device. What? You made a machine that can copy people's skills like I do? RED SKULL: The neurotransducer will replicate not only the captain's skills, but his tactics and combat strategies, and then be programed into my new army. (GRUNTS) Save your strength. (CLANKS) The restraints are solid adamantium. Even the hulk could not break them. I'd take that bet any day. Captain, in the name of hydra, I thank you for your contribution. (SCREAMING) (THUNDER RUMBLING) IRON MAN: Gotta be here somewhere. Come on, come on. Where's that security footage? Yes! Taskmaster? What was that creep doing here? JARVIS: Damage report, sir. Minimal damage to the hull, loss of power 22%. Inventory report. The prototype repulsor Cannon is missing, and... Oh, dear. Oh, dear, what? Your iron man mark vi stealth armor seems to be missing as well. Seems to be? What else can go wrong? I'll try to find something, sir. I'm not in the mood, Jarvis. My apologies, sir. Hmm. Cap sure went down easy. Let's take a closer look. You've gotta be kidding me. He was faking it the whole time? Of all the reckless plans! Perhaps captain Rogers has adopted your quote, "fly by the seat of your pants," methods, sir? Well, cap obviously is giving me the heads-up to come after him, and that's what I'm gonna do. The captain's homing beacon was destroyed. How will you find him? Actually I was gonna ask for your help on that one, Jarvis. Did taskmaster leave anything behind? Scanning now, sir. I've located something. This a small amount of mud left in the hangar that is not from you or captain Rogers. Run a full spectrum analysis. Test complete. The composition is made up of minerals and rare Clay found in the baltic highlands. Well, that narrows it down a little. Cross-reference with S.H.I.E.L.D.'s list of taskmaster's suspected hideouts. Right away, sir. (SCANNING) I have one suspected location. An abandoned military bunker in Southern Estonia. That's it. Hold the fort, Jarvis. Very good, sir. (GROANING) Impressive. A lesser man would have been obliterated. (BEEPING) Great leader, we did it! We have successfully recorded captain America's fighting skills. They are incredibly clean and organized. This man is truly a remarkable specimen. The captain's skills are ready for your use. Excellent. Your service will be greatly rewarded. You could've just paid to copy my skills. I'm a better fighter than that patriot any day. Doubtful. You are a mercenary, sorely lacking what captain America possesses. Courage, resolve and dedication to an ideal. Qualities perfect for my new army. So what happens to him now? Now I employ the second function of this device. Not only can it copy brainwaves, it can write them, like data onto a hard drive. (MACHINE SOUNDING) Initiating hydra indoctrination sequence. Your world is about to change, soldier. Soon you will know nothing but absolute obedience to hydra. And you will answer only to me! I wish you had lips, skully, so you could kiss my star-spangled... (SCREAMING) No! No! No! HYDRA TROOPERS: Hail hydra! Hail the red skull! Hail hydra! Hail the red skull! Hail hydra! Hail the red skull! Hail hydra! Hail the red skull! Hail hydra! Hail the red skull! Hail hydra! Hail the red skull! (CHANTING CONTINUES) (RED SKULL LAUGHING) (GROANS) (STRAINING) Get out of my head! (GROANING) Resistance is useless. Great leader, your volunteers have been prepared for the serum. And here I wanted to watch captain America's will bend like a weed beneath my boot. No matter. Taskmaster, stay here and make sure the captain's conversion is complete. Do not turn your back on him for a second. Whatever you wish. And his shield. (GRUNTS) Very well, great leader. I would curb that sharp tongue of yours, taskmaster. Lest it cuts your throat. Hmm. (CAPTAIN AMERICA GROANS) JARVIS: Atmospheric re-entry complete. I recommend initiating deceleration. Sir? You can slow down any time. Shouldn't have flown off without cap. Captain Rogers clearly allowed himself to be captured. He was reckless. That's not how cap does things. He got himself in trouble. I know it. Sir, we are approaching the target coordinates at an unsafe speed. Knock, knock. AUTOMATED VOICE: Intruder alert! Hello, I'm looking for a friend of mine. Tall, broad-shouldered, dressed like a flag. (WEAPONS FIRING) Destroy him! You know, you try and be a nice guy... (ALL GROAN) I'll tell you what, you fellas take your 10-minute coffee break. I'll go find my friend. I don't get taskmaster. I mean, he's an accomplished bad guy, he could build a lair anywhere. Why some dingy cold war bunker? JARVIS: Location is everything. I scan life forms five meters ahead. IRON MAN: I don't think that's cap. Ready? Ready. Open fire! (WEAPONS FIRING) Well, you gotta admire their persistence. Activate the sonic disruptors. JARVIS: Charging now, sir. (ALL GROAN) Sheesh, can we just get to the boss fight already? Figures cap'd end up in the gym. I don't think I wanna work out on this thing though. We gotta find him, Jarvis. IRON MAN: Cap! You in here? Nice pool. Or should I say hot tub. JARVIS: This is an extremely concentrated form of hydrochloric acid. Lethal. I wasn't planning on taking a dip. CAPTAIN AMERICA: Stark! Huh? Whoa, hey cap! Same team here! Death to all who oppose hydra! Oh, great. Aw, no, cap. What've they done to you? They showed me the truth. The strength that will be our new world order! Whoa! JARVIS: Biometric scans indicate the captain's brain waves have been radically altered to those of a completely different person. Different person? Who? Greetings, stark. Oh, him. Terrific. Allow me introduce you to my latest agent. Sure, he's wearing less festive colors, but I think we've met. No. This captain America shares my vision of the future! Yeah, speaking of vision, this is strictly pay per view, so get lost! (GRUNTS) For hydra! For the red skull! Cap, I thought we decided you were gonna be like me. This ain't me. Everything always has to be about you, stark. You're selfish and conceited. Okay. That's it! I don't know what the skull did to you, buddy, but you gotta snap out of it! (CHUCKLES) Ah! Now stop shooting! Don't make me hurt you. (WEAPON FIRING) Don't make me laugh. Okay. This is your last chance! I warned you! Now it gets real! (GRUNTS) Wait. What is that? Ah! Laugh that off, stark. JARVIS: Sir, the armor's been compromised. We've lost power to the thrusters. Really, Jarvis? I hadn't noticed. Remind me to remove stating the obvious from your programing. Now how do we get this stupid thing off? Ah! Can't reach it... AUTOMATED VOICE: Stark armor security codes, accessed. Bingo. Now you will learn why hydra shall reign supreme! Gotcha! Ah! (GROANS) Nice one, stark, but you're too late. How's he doing, Jarvis? JARVIS: His brainwaves are normalizing. My scans indicate captain Rogers is stuck in a rem-like dream state. Time to wake up, buddy. (GROANS) Sorry about that, cap. You okay? Uh... I just had the worst nightmare a soldier could have. Where am I? Well, you're back where you belong. Hydra hijacked your brain. Hydra? You really had me worried there. Here, lemme give ya a hand. (GRUNTS) Ah! AUTOMATED VOICE: Stark encryption decoded. Verify. Verification complete. I have you now, iron man. I thought I fixed you! (GRUNTS) You did. Don't you know a spontaneous plan when you see one? I guess this means I have to lose? Just make it look good. You are no match for hydra, fool! Says you, traitor! Ah! JARVIS: Sir, system reboot has begun! Great news. (SCREAMS) Oh, it hurts! Skull's programing must be strong for you to finish your own friend. By the red skull's command, take me to our great leader. Yeah, well, he's not gonna be the boss forever. What do you think about the skull bowing down to us? Old red and gruesome would keep you a slave, I'll make you a partner. Join me and we'll turn hydra into a twin-headed dragon and rule it all! To a new hydra? To a new hydra! So when do we take out the skull? We leave for Antarctica soon. Antarctica, eh? That's all I needed to hear. (GRUNTS) Ha! Hmph, so you broke skull's programing. He brainwashed the wrong guy. You're the one who wants to be him. Red skull is nothing to me. Let's see him do this! You gonna hold your breath forever? I didn't want to interrupt your terrific acting. How about you make it easy on yourself and give up? I've studied you both! I know how you fight! Yeah, but I'm guessing you don't know how we fight together. You know, I don't think he does. This is gonna be fun. (GRUNTS) Really? You let yourself get captured and turned into a psycho? It seemed like a good idea at the time. Isn't that what you always say? Oh, I get it. You used my spontaneous style... (GROANS) ...to sneak in and get brainwashed so you could find out where the red skull is. Stay! So, I win the bet! No, it was all part of "the plan," so I won the bet. Let's just say we're even. By the way, what's hydra up to? You don't wanna know. You sure we shouldn't bring him along, just in case? He's too dangerous. We'll have S.H.I.E.L.D. come and get him. Just in case. Don't go anywhere now, copycat. IRON MAN: So, you're not gonna change? This outfit tricked taskmaster, it might work on the skull, too. Stop stealing my crazy idea schtick! JARVIS: Sir, I've got something. The missing mark vi's beacon is nearby but weak, as if it were shielded. What are you doing? Scanning for the suit of armor that taskmaster stole from me. Wow, he really played you. Were you planning on telling me? What? I mean, I meant to let him steal it. Yeah, so we could trace him. Right. All right, fine! Let's just go bust some skulls. (CLANKING) AUTOMATED VOICE: Iron man armor access granted. Hmm. I think a name change is in order. I kinda like the iron master. (CHUCKLES) Catchy. So, not a word about my flying? Your flying is the least of my worries. Oh, what? You don't like my plan? It's just a little too "me". Come on, it's well thought out. And it's the last thing red skull would expect. I figured the wild man in you would love it. This is the quietest you've ever been. What're you up to back there? I'm not saying, just in case skull still has some control over your brain. You really think I'd turn on you? Probably not, but I like surprises, so I'm working on a back-up plan just in case yours doesn't work. Wow, strategy from iron man? What I can say, you're rubbing off on me. Maybe I'll earn a merit badge. Got an incoming transmission, better get outta sight. Right. AUTOMATED VOICE: Approaching vessel, identify. This is taskmaster's ship, vessel 6769. Captain hydra requesting permission to land. 6769, maintain your course. RED SKULL: Captain, what have you to say? Hail hydra! Ah. Good. Where is the taskmaster? He tried to convince me to betray you, sir. He failed. His turning on me was inevitable, but I did not expect it so soon. I took the liberty of destroying the traitor. You'll make a worthy replacement. Perhaps even my second in command. IRON MAN: Nice. Hydra has a great benefit package, man. Medical, dental, free mind control. And you're already wearing one of their snazzy matching outfits. Hey, how about you work on that backup plan? HYDRA TECH: (OVER PA) Hydra troopers, mobilize to 031. All flight crews report to mission briefing. (LOUD WHIRRING) I don't like this. They're prepping for a large scale attack. Well, then it's a good thing we showed up for the party. I can pretend to be a bad guy. What are you gonna do? I've got something up my sleeve. I pretty much invented stealth tech so... That's surprising, considering how much you like to be seen. Captain America cracking jokes. I like it! Now you just have to work on being funny. Sir. We're to escort you to the great leader. Carry on. Hey, we've got an intruder! Actually, you've got two. (GRUNTING) (CHUCKLING) I knew you couldn't stay out of sight long. No, no, it's just you being a hydra goon is creeping me out. Yeah, I'm gonna need a long shower when we're done with this mission. Of course, there's a giant hydra rocket down here. Why can't these guys just rob jewelry stores? That doesn't look any better. What is it anyway? CAPTAIN AMERICA: It's red skull's new army, compliments of my blood. (LOUD WHIRRING) (GRUNTING) (LOUD SHRIEK) 'Cause the world needs more captain America mutations, freaks and weirdos? Seriously, hydra. IRON MAN: Did you notice how I didn't just run out there this time? CAPTAIN AMERICA: Yes, and I was surprised. IRON MAN: You were supposed to say, "impressed". So, what are they doing down here? I don't know, but that looks familiar. Isn't that one of yours? IRON MAN: They're mass producing my repulsor Cannon! I'm gonna sue 'em. Right after I beat 'em into next Sunday. That's not the only thing they've ripped off. (LOUD THUD) (HISSING) IRON MAN: Is that a copy of your shield? It's huge. All right, so what's our big strategy? We destroy everything. Now you're talking. (GRUNTS) (GRUNTING) This design is ingenious. These weapons will make hydra unstoppable. You know, the wattage settings on these arc capacitors are all wrong. (GASPS) Sound the alarm! (GRUNTS) No, don't. (ALARM BUZZING) Argh! Stark! What the heck are you doing? What? I'm blowing stuff up! (GRUNTS) Sorry, slowpoke. (GRUNTING) (LOUD EXPLOSION) Come on, guys. You're making this too easy! (BEEPING) Know what happens when you pirate my tech? This. (LOUD EXPLOSIONS) (INDISTINCT SHOUTING) You know, I'm kind of liking this whole strategy thing. Time for phase two. Let's take a peek at what's behind that. Incoming! (GRUNTING) (WEAPONS FIRING) I'm disappointed your programing failed, captain. You made an excellent hydra agent. Sorry, there's no future in it. (GROANING) IRON MAN: Or in you, skull. (SIGHS) You will beg me to spare you, when I control the world. TASKMASTER: Is that so, red skull? Well, look who put some iron in their diet. Got to admit, the new paint job is cool. Excellent, taskmaster. Now that you've acquired stark's ultimate weapon, you will put it to my use. I'm done taking orders from you, skull. The iron master is taking control of hydra! Fool, you work for me! I love it when the bad guys bicker. CAPTAIN AMERICA: Makes our job easier. Consider this a hostile takeover. What? (STRAINING) Can't be. Ugh... I'm unable attack you. Why? Because you are my slave. Now bow! (GROANING) You thought taking iron man's stealth armor was your idea? No. I programed you to steal it. The memory was erased, but you also spent time in my neurotransducer and were conditioned to think as I do. Your recent ambition to take over hydra? It came from me! You are no more than a hired gun and you will obey my every command. (GROANS) Hey, skull, you're kind of a control freak, you know that? For your first directive, destroy iron man and captain America! (GRUNTING) No more playing army, skull. You have yet to see my army. Or should I say "our" army? (LOUD FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING) So, do we do this your way or my way? Not sure it's gonna matter. Crush them! Only chance is to keep moving! Clear a path, I'll cover you! (LOUD EXPLOSION) Oh! (GROANING) Come on. I'm okay. Let's run for it! What are you gawking at, idiots? Finish them! (LOUD EXPLOSION) How many of these things are there? Got to get past 'em. Come on! Let's see you block this. (GROWLING) Oh, no. This way! You know, I really could use some boot jets. (PANTING) Bad enough these things are strong! But they can fight, too! Worse than that, they fight smart. (GRUNTING) (GASPS) You don't recognize their style? Besides being armed with your Cannon, my ubermen have been enhanced with my super soldier serum and programed with the captain's superior combat skills. All of his years of training are going to pay off for hydra! Come on, Tony, I think it's time to go. Whoa! Huh? Okay. My turn, cap. I'll clear us a path out of here! (LOUD EXPLOSION) (GRUNTS) (GRUNTING) (GROANING) In a way, it will be captain America's army that will sweep across the globe, led by my unquestioningly loyal field commander, the iron master! How are you coming with that plan? Plan? Oh, it's incoming now. And it's more like a bomb. Bomb? (LOW RUMBLING) (ALL GASPS) (SCREAMING) A gamma bomb. Somebody call for back-up? Late for the party, big guy. No, you're just in time. Hulk. Smash. (ROARING) (WEAPONS FIRING) (GROWLING) CAPTAIN AMERICA: Got to admit, nice plan. I hadn't counted on the monster. Delay them as long as you can. I will initiate the final phase. By your command. I'm going after red skull. I got a score to settle, too! What am I supposed to do? You're doing it! Hoping you'd say that! Now where's... Found him! (GLASS CRACKING) (HULK ROARING) First you rip off cap, now me? There's not an original bone in your body. There's no such thing as an original idea, stark. IRON MAN: So let's go with the classics. Jarvis! Initiate the remote! Shut down his armor! JARVIS: Taskmaster has installed a hydra encryption device to prevent such action. It will take minutes to override. (LOUD BUZZING) We don't have minutes. COMPUTER: Rocket fueling is complete. Initiate the launch sequence. Pre-launch protocol has begun. (RAPID BEEPING) CAPTAIN AMERICA: Hydra cap reporting for duty. You can't win, skull! Oh, I've learned how to beat you, captain. Don't play by the rules. And yet you keep losing! RED SKULL: Not this time! And through my defeats, I've learned something else from you, always have a final plan. The rocket is filled with the super soldier serum I used on my troops, complete with your blood sample. Millions will soon be transformed into ultra-powered soldiers under my control. The planet will be reshaped into the image of hydra. (GRUNTING) Get off of me! Give me that! (SNARLING) How do you like it? (GROANING) Okay! I'm offended. You wanna fight? I'm right here. Come out, taskmaster. Show me what you got. TASKMASTER: Over here. (LOUD EXPLOSION) (IRON MAN GRUNTS) I know all your tricks, stark. You're looking at the new iron man! Jarvis, get me into that suit! JARVIS: Your decryption hacks are working, but very slowly, sir. Keep trying. In the meantime, maybe I can hack taskmaster! (ENERGY PULSATING) (GROANING) That... That won't stop me! Wasn't meant to. I freed you from the skull's programing. You don't have to serve him anymore. Really? Appreciate it, stark! Hey, you owe me! I'll show you what I owe you! Jarvis! It's now or never! JARVIS: Sir, I was able to access and deactivate his armor's energy shields. That's all I need! Charge up the hull. Let's give him a shock! (SCREAMING) I can't move! What have you done? Ha! Taught you a lesson. Your fist is no match for my brain. (GROANS) So much for the iron copycat. Jarvis, pinpoint cap for me. Hydra is making hulk mad! Hydra won't like hulk mad! Hulk smash! Why, you... Come here, ugly! (ROARING) (BEEPING) Your plan ends now, skull. Does it, captain? I have decided it is better you are not with hydra, captain. Your compassion is a weakness. Tell it to my shield! Ha! The great captain America has missed. It was bound to happen. Without your precious shield, you're finished. I guess you're right. COMPUTER: Launch sequence will commence in... 30, 29, 28, 27, 26, 25... RED SKULL: You've lost your mind! My rocket will spread hydra's destiny all over your beloved homeland. CAPTAIN AMERICA: If your rocket makes it that far. COMPUTER: 14, 13, 12... Guess I didn't miss after all. Once in a while, you got to do what you said, "not play by the rules." COMPUTER: Five, four, three, two... One, ignition. (LOUD EXPLOSION) Captain! CAPTAIN AMERICA: Stark! Where are you? We have to get out of here, now! Stark, do you read? Over! Hulk? This is cap. Can you hear me? (GRUNTING) Stark! Where are you? Hello! Ah, you're early this time. All according to my plan. After you. Hulk, get out, now! Working on it. Hulk tired of hydra. Hulk smash! Oh, come on! (BEEPING) IRON MAN: That was closer than usual. I hope hulk made it out of there. See if you can reach him. Big green, do you copy? JARVIS: Hulk's com is unresponsive, sir. Also, the arc reactor suffered critical damage in the escape and will be shutting down now. Are you kidding me? Uh, stark? What's happening? IRON MAN: Experiencing some technical difficulties. So, this isn't part of the ride? Apparently, it is today. You gonna do something about this? Jarvis! Reroute power from the emergency reserve. JARVIS: As I informed you earlier, sir, the reserve was damaged in your battle with captain America. IRON MAN: Don't tell me that! Options! I need options! Dreadfully sorry, sir, there are none. CAPTAIN AMERICA: So are you fixing this? IRON MAN: As luck would have it, not this time! Stark! This is gonna hurt! Yeah, well, you're the one who's always supposed to be prepared! Pull a parachute out of your shield or something! Stark! (HULK SHOUTING) Oh, so that's what that feels like. Yeah. That's two you owe me. (LOUD EXPLOSION) IRON MAN: So much for hydra's big scheme. See? Not all plans work out, cap. Mine did. (SIGHS) (RED SKULL GRUNTING) Perimeter secure, sir. You failed, skull. Your need to control captain America doomed us. It was your treachery that doomed us. And for that you will be eliminated. Oh! Oh, stark, you're a piece of work. (GRUNTS) HUH? S.H.I.E.L.D. AGENT: Attention, hydra! This is S.H.I.E.L.D. Drop your weapons, or you will be fired upon! (TASKMASTER LAUGHING) Come on out, cap. For better or worse. I do like the colors. And the boot jets, of course. BOTH: Ready? Avengers attack! (SCREAMING) I'm going in. Roger that, cap. I'm on your wing. Whoa... IRON MAN: I'll get him. (GRUNTS) Wow. You both missed me. I don't see how. You're so big, green and ugly. HULK: Wow! You really can't hit me. Come on, stark. Iron patriot, incoming. Now you're getting it, cap. That tickles. Stop it. Yeah, you two are lame. What's this about, anyway? I bet cap if he fought more like me, spontaneous and unpredictable, he'd do better. And I bet Tony if he was little more tactical and strategic in mind like me, he'd do better. Oh, no. Cap, those are heat seekers! And they've locked onto me. CAPTAIN AMERICA: Sorry, Tony. I was just winging it, like you do. IRON MAN: Don't worry, I got this. Just need some room to maneuver. CAPTAIN AMERICA: You're running out of room to maneuver. Then it's time for some strategy. Hmm... CAPTAIN AMERICA: They're closing in! I see! CAPTAIN AMERICA: There's one on your six! Got it! CAPTAIN AMERICA: Only one left, I'll get it! IRON MAN: Wait, no! (GRUNTS) (BOTH SCREAMING) (HULK LAUGHING) (BOTH GROANING) So, you both lost? We both won! We both won! You're both good at what you do. Why don't you just stick to that? You know, he's right. You're pretty good at all that plotty planny stuff. And you're fairly decent at shooting from the hip. We never talked about what I'm good at. Smashing. Now, let's go eat. I could go for some raw menu macrobiotic organic tofu. I have no idea what you just said. I'm a meat and potatoes kind of guy. Hulk saved you and hulk wants pie. Yeah, okay. I could go for pie. Pie it is. (HULK ROARING)
