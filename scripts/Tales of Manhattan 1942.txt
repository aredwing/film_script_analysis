JUST WHAT I TOLD YOU. YOU WERE LUCKY TO GET RID OF HER LAST YEAR. IT WAS MORE THAN LUCK. IT WAS A BLESSING. WHY DID I HAVE THREE FLOPS IN A ROW? BECAUSE SHE THOUGH SHE COULD ACT.

HOW MANY TIMES HAVE I TOLD YOU WHAT I'VE BEEN THROUGH THIS PAST YEAR? HE SUSPECTS US CONSTANTLY. THE MERE MENTION OF YOUR NAME, HE RAVES LIKE A MADMAN. THE LUNACY MUST BE A STRAIN ON YOU. PATHETIC. THIS IS NO TIME TO JOKE. PLEASE, YOU MUST GO. I'VE ARRANGED EVERYTHING PERFECTLY FOR US, AND NOW YOU'RE GOING TO RUIN EVERYTHING I'VE DONE. YOU ARE SO COMPLETELY BEWILDERED THAT YOU HAVEN'T EVEN ASKED ME HOW THE OPENING WAS. I OPENED IN A PLAY TONIGHT, IF YOU REMEMBER. OH, FORGIVE ME. HOW WAS IT? A SMASH. WENT LIKE A HOUSE AFIRE. AND YOU? AT MY BEST. I'M SO GLAD. THANK YOU. PLEASE GO, PAUL. I'LL BE IN TOWN TOMORROW AT 10:00 TO SEE YOU. OH, YOU WILL? CERTAINLY. AS WE PLANNED. YOU LITTLE TWO-FACED LIAR. PAUL, YOU'RE MAD. TOMORROW, EH? NO. YOU WILL NOT SEE ME TOMORROW OR EVER AGAIN- UNLESS YOU BUY A TICKE TO THE BOX OFFICE. I'M SAYING GOODBYE FOREVER. YOU CAME OUT HERE TO SAY GOODBYE TO ME? NO. I CAME OUT HERE TO PLEAD WITH YOU, TO HOLD YOU, KISS YOU, FALL AT YOUR FEET. YOU'VE EVIDENTLY CHANGED YOUR MIND. YES, WHEN YOU LIED AGAIN. DO YOU KNOW WHAT IT IS TO LOOK INTO A WOMAN'S EYES WHEN SHE IS LYING? FORGIVE ME. I SHOULD BE MORE TOLERANT WITH A LIAR. I HAVE BEEN ONE MYSELF SO OFTEN. WE'LL PART WITHOU ANY FURTHER ARGUMENT- QUIETLY AND CALMLY. I KNOW EVERYTHING. YOU'RE GOING WITH HIM TOMORROW AT 9:00 ON A PLANE TO CANADA... TO HUNT MOOSE. OH. SO THAT'S THE POINT. YOU DIDN'T TELL HIM YOU WERE THROUGH WITH HIM. YOU DIDN'T TELL HIM YOU LOVE ME. INSTEAD, YOU HELD YOUR HUSBAND AND SAID, "YES, DARLING, I'LL GO WITH YOU ANYWHERE. "I AM YOUR GOOD AND LOYAL WIFE. I LOVE ONLY YOU. NOBODY ELSE." HAH. PAUL, PLEASE. YOU MUST GO- JOHN. LOOK WHO DROPPED IN. HELLO, MR. ORMAN. GLAD TO SEE YOU. HOW ARE YOU, SIR? I DIDN'T KNOW YOU WERE EXPECTING THE CELEBRATED MR. ORMAN TONIGHT. I DIDN'T TELL YOU, BUT I WAS. PAUL OPENED IN A NEW SHOW TONIGHT. OH, YES. SO THE NEW SHOW WAS A FLOP, EH? NO. ON THE CONTRARY, I WAS A MAGNIFICENT SUCCESS. I'M SPENDING THE WEEKEND A FEW MILES FROM HERE. I DROPPED IN TO WISH YOU HAPPY HUNTING... IN CANADA, ISN'T IT? YES. I DO ALL MY HUNTING IN CANADA. OH, WHOA THERE. NOT SO FAST. A DRINK, MR. ORMAN? NO, THANKS. ETHEL? NO. DON'T YOU THINK YOU'RE HAVING TOO MANY, DEAR? FRANKLY, NO. AND YOU'RE MIXING THEM, TOO. PLEASE, JOHN. THAT'S THE WAY I LIKE MY DRINKS-MIXED. KEEPS ME INTERESTED IN DRINKING. OTHERWISE I GET BORED. SURE YOU WON'T HAVE ONE? NO, THANKS. I HAVE OTHER REMEDIES FOR BOREDOM. I IMAGINE. WELL, I'M SORRY I CANNO STAY FOR YOUR PARTY, SO I'LL SAY GOODBYE. AND A VERY PLEASANT TRIP TO BOTH OF YOU. WELL, YOU'RE WASTING ONE OF YOUR GOODBYES. MY WIFE ISN'T GOING WITH ME. SHE INSISTS ON STAYING BEHIND. THAT'S OLD CHARLIE HENDERSON. I MUST SPEAK TO HIM BEFORE HE GETS TOO TIGHT. WELL, GOODBYE. GOODBYE. GO TO THE LODGE AT THE END OF THE GARDEN. I'LL BE THERE IMMEDIATELY. I ADORE YOU. FORGIVE ME FOR DOUBTING YOU. CERTAINLY. DO YOU LOVE ME? OH, YES. OF COURSE I DO. BUT, DARLING, WE HAVEN'T MUCH TIME. WHAT DO YOU MEAN? YOU HAVE THE REST OF YOUR LIFE. BUT, PAUL... OH, COME. PLEASE, SIT DOWN. I LEARNED SOMETHING TONIGHT. I LEARNED HOW MUCH I LOVE YOU. YOU TOLD ME THA A YEAR AGO, AND YOU LET ME GO. YOU LET ME MARRY HIM. YOU NEVER EVEN PHONED. IF YOU'D ASKED ME TO FORGIVE YOU- I DIDN'T KNOW THEN THAT LOVE WAS MORE THAN A GOOD SCENE. I DIDN'T KNOW IT WAS SOMETHING THAT... THAT WOULD TEAR AT YOUR HEART... AND BURN THROUGH THE GREASEPAINT. YOU FEEL THAT WAY? I DO. MY DARLING... I KNOW WHA YOU'VE BEEN DOING. YOU HAVE BEEN TELLING ME LIES AND HIM LIES. I KNOW. I'VE DONE I MYSELF TOO OFTEN. BUT THAT IS OVER... FOR BOTH OF US. WHAT DO YOU MEAN? YOU'RE COMING ALONG WITH ME. TOMORROW. BRAZIL. YOU CAN WIRE HIM. WE'LL STAY THERE UNTIL HE GIVES YOU A DIVORCE. AND THEN... THEN WE'LL GET MARRIED. MARRIED? YOU? YES, ME. I NEED YOU. I REALIZED THAT TODAY. I NEED YOU, AND I'VE GOT TO PAY FOR YOU. YOU FRIGHTEN ME. BUT YOU... YOU LOVE ME ENOUGH? OH, YES, DARLING. I'LL CALL YOU IN THE MORNING, RIGHT AFTER HE LEAVES. BUT... IF YOU LOVE ME SO MUCH, WHY WERE YOU SO FRIGHTENED IN THE HOUSE? HE'S VERY CURIOUS WHEN HE'S DRINKING. I DIDN'T WANT ANYTHING TO HAPPEN TO YOU. WHY? I COULDN' STAND THAT. I COULDN'T LIVE WITHOUT YOU. I COULDN'T- MURRAY HILL 7564, PLEASE. WHO ARE YOU CALLING? MR. WEBB. MY MANAGER. WHY HIM NOW? GOT SOME NEWS FOR HIM. HE'S WAITING AT MY APARTMENT. WHAT NEWS, PAUL? KISS ME. I ADORE YOU. MADLY. STUPIDLY. BLINDLY- HELLO, OLIVER? YES, IT'S ME. PAY ATTENTION, PLEASE, AND NO ARGUMENTS. I WANT YOU TO CLOSE THE PLAY. I SAID CLOSE THE PLAY. I'M LEAVING TOMORROW FOR SIX MONTHS. PAUL, CLOSE A HIT? DARLING, YOU'RE WORTH A THOUSAND HITS. I HOPE. OLIVER? NO. NO. I'M IN MY RIGHT MIND. IN FACT, FOR THE FIRS TIME SINCE I WAS BORN. DO WHAT I TELL YOU! IT'S MY SHOW, MY MONEY, MY THEATER! ALL RIGHT. PAY EVERYBODY OFF! AND GET ME TWO TICKETS TO RIO. ON THE CLIPPER. FOR TOMORROW. THAT'S RIGHT. I'M A LITTLE AMAZED AT MYSELF. DID I SOUND VERY NAIVE? NO. THAT'S HOW IT GOES. ALWAYS ACTING UNTIL YOU FIND SOMETHING YOU CAN BELIEVE IN. Put out the light. THE PARTY'S BECOMING A BORE. TOO MANY DRUNKS. I WAS LOOKING FOR YOU. WE WERE TALKING OVER PAUL'S NEW PLAY. IT WAS SO NOISY IN THERE. YES, SO I IMAGINE. I WONDERED IF YOU HAD CHANGED YOUR MIND. ABOUT WHAT? CANADA. COMING WITH ME? NO. I'M AFRAID NOT. I DON'T SEE HOW YOU COULD RESIS THE BEST SHOOTING IN THE WORLD... IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR MOOSE. HAVE YOU EVER HUNTED MOOSE... MR. ORMAN? NO, I HAVEN'T. MAYBE... YOU'D LIKE TO COME WITH ME. JOHN, YOU'RE DRUNK. PLEASE. DON'T EXAGGERATE. I NEVER GET DRUNK. I GET INVOLVED, BUT NOT DRUNK. I'LL LET YOU USE MY FAVORITE GUN, MR. ORMAN. LET ME SHOW YOU MY COLLECTION. ONE OF THE BEST, YOU KNOW. HERE IT IS. TOOK ME YEARS TO GATHER THIS. AND HERE... HERE... IS MY FAVORITE. NEVER FAILED ME. HERE HE IS. COLONEL JOHNSON. COLONEL, HOW ARE YOU? OH. BUT I... I WAS JUST GOING. NONSENSE. ALWAYS WANTED TO TALK TO YOU. DON'T MIND IF I SPRUCE UP THE COLONEL, DO YOU? PLEASE DON'T POINT THAT. DON'T WORRY. THE COLONEL'S NOT LOADED. I MAY BE A TRIFLE, BUT NOT THE COLONEL. THREE YEARS AGO, I GOT AN ELK. THERE HE IS. LAST YEAR, I SHO OVER THREE MOOSE. THE COLONEL WAS ONLY A CAPTAIN THEN. I PROMOTED HIM AFTER THE THIRD MOOSE. WHAT DID YOU WAN TO TALK ABOUT? A LOT OF THINGS. BUT WE'LL BEGIN WITH GUNS. THEY'RE MY HOBBY. I DON'T THINK PAUL IS INTERESTED IN GUNS. GUNS HAVE A CERTAIN INTEREST... IN THE HANDS OF EXPERTS. EXACTLY. A MAN WOULD BE A NITWI NOT TO BE INTERESTED IN THIS WEAPON. A BLIND MAN COULD HIT A DUCK'S EYE AT 100 PACES WITH THE COLONEL. HA HA. GOOD OLD COLONEL. YOU REMEMBER THAT FELLOW UP THERE? ETHEL, WHERE DID I PUT THAT OIL CAN? WE'VE GOT TO GET BACK TO THE HOUSE. THEY'LL BE MISSING US. NOT A CHANCE. THEY'RE HAVING A WONDERFUL TIME. WHAT DID YOU WAN TO SAY ABOUT GUNS? EVER USE 'EM? YES. ON THE STAGE. SHOOT 'EM? ON A STAGE. NOT REAL BULLETS. NO. JUST BLANKS, EH? YES. ONLY BLANKS. WE ACTORS PREFER THEM. THIS IS SILLY, JOHN. PAUL'S GIVEN AN OPENING PERFORMANCE, AND HE'S PROBABLY EXHAUSTED. DARLING, YOU HAVEN' DANCED WITH ME THIS EVENING. COME ON, WON'T YOU? I NOTICED THAT. IT'S TOO LATE NOW. WILL YOU STOP PUTTERING WITH THAT GUN? I'M GETTING VERY ANGRY! WHY DON'T YOU GO, ETHEL? PERHAPS YOUR HUSBAND WOULD PREFER TALKING TO ME ALONE. I HAVE NO SECRETS FROM MY WIFE. SHE MAY HAVE FROM ME. THERE'S ALWAYS HALF OF WOMEN MISSING. BUT WITH MEN, THEY'RE USUALLY IN ONE PIECE, FULL OF TRUTH AND HONOR. YES. THOSE THINGS COME WITH AGE. THANK YOU. WELL PUT. I SUPPOSE AN ACTOR CAN GET ALONG WITHOUT MUCH TRUTH AND HONOR. OH, YES. AN ACTOR CAN GE ALONG WITHOUT ANYTHING... EXCEPT A GOOD PLAY. SORRY I MISSED YOUR SHOW. I UNDERSTAND YOU GET KILLED IN IT. YES... AT THE END OF THE LAST ACT. COULDN'T MAKE UP THEIR MINDS, EH? NO, IT ISN'T THAT. THEY COULD NOT AFFORD TO KILL ME EARLIER. IT WOULD HAVE BEEN BAD FOR THE PLAY. I SEE. I UNDERSTAND A WOMAN SHOOTS YOU. YES. THE WOMAN I LOVE. SOUNDS VERY DRAMATIC. JOHN... I DON'T WAN ANY INTERRUPTIONS. HOW DO YOU ACT WHEN SHE POINTS THE GUN AT YOU? AFRAID? NO. A LITTLE SAD, BUT RESIGNED. I'M DRINKING A HIGHBALL. HAVE ONE. NO. THANKS. I CAN'T BEAR TO SEE YOU DRUNK LIKE THIS. I'M NOT BORING YOU, MR. ORMAN? NO. NOT AT ALL. YOU STAND RIGHT UP TO HER AND DON' ACT AFRAID, EH? WHY IS THAT? DON'T SOUND REAL TO ME. WELL, WHAT WOULD YOU SUGGEST I DO? A FELLOW ALWAYS ACTS AFRAID WHEN HE'S FACING A GUN. OH, BUT AN ACTOR WITHOU COURAGE WOULD BE A FRAUD. THE AUDIENCE ALWAYS LIKES COURAGE. SO YOU THINK OF YOUR AUDIENCE WHEN YOU'RE ACTING? ALWAYS. I COULD NEVER UNDERSTAND ETHEL. I COULD NEVER FIGURE OU WHETHER SHE MEANT SOMETHING OR WAS JUST ACTING IT. KEPT ME GUESSING FOR A YEAR. MARRIAGE IS NO FUN WHEN IT TURNS INTO A GUESSING CONTEST. ALL RIGHT. THERE YOU ARE, COLONEL. ALL SPRUCED UP NEAT AND CLEAN AND READY TO GO HUNTING. JOHN! YOU TOOK... YOU TOOK QUITE A LONG TIME ABOUT IT, MR. HALLOWAY. I WAS GETTING VERY NERVOUS. IT WAS AN ACCIDENT. WAS IT? YOU SAW IT, ETHEL. I WAS CLEANING THE GUN. IT WENT OFF. I DIDN'T THINK IT WAS LOADED. YOU'VE KILLED HIM. WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO? THEY'LL COME HERE. THE POLICE. THEY'LL TAKE YOU AWAY. OH, JOHN, WHY DID YOU DO IT? THIS'LL RUIN YOU. BOTH OF US. WHY DID YOU DO IT? IT WAS AN ACCIDENT. I WAS CLEANING MY GUN. YOU SAW IT. OH, YES. YES, OF COURSE. IT WAS AN ACCIDENT. YOU CAN TELL THE POLICE... THAT IT WAS... UNINTENTIONAL. THAT YOUR HUSBAND AND I WERE THE BEST OF FRIENDS. YES, OF COURSE. I'LL TELL THEM THAT. I'LL SAY THAT. JOHN, CALL A DOCTOR, PLEASE. NO. IT'S TOO LATE FOR A DOCTOR. THE CURTAIN IS COMING DOWN. IT'S THE END OF ACT III. HE SUDDENLY- NO, NO. WE'LL CALL A DOCTOR. OH, DARLING, I DIDN'T KNOW. I'VE BEEN STUPID AND HORRIBLE. I MADE YOU DO THIS. HE DID NOTHING. IT WAS AN ACCIDENT. IT MIGHT HAPPEN... TO ANYONE. I'LL CALL THE SERVANTS. YOU'LL BE MY WITNESS? YES. TO THE END. GOOD GIRL. ALL RIGHT. I'LL CALL THEM. HA HA HA HA. DON'T BOTHER. I'M ALL RIGHT. WELL, YOU'RE - YOU'RE NOT HURT. THANK HEAVEN. HOW DID I DO, MR. HALLOWAY? LIKE WHAT? MY PERFORMANCE. COULDN'T RESIST IT. HA HA. DEATH SCENES HAVE BEEN MY SPECIALTY SINCE I BECAME FAMOUS. SO WHEN ANYBODY SHOOTS ME, I FALL DEAD. YOU WERE ACTING? UH-HUH. OH, IT'S AN OFF NIGHT FOR A COLONEL. HE IS NOT A WIZARD. MISSED ME BY A MILE. I HOPE YOU HAVE BETTER LUCK IN CANADA, MR. HALLOWAY. OH, NOW, DON' FEEL SO DEPRESSED. YOU KNOW, I WOULDN' LOOK TOO GOOD UP THERE ON A PLAQUE. YOU WERE ACTING? YES. YOUR HUSBAND PUT IT INTO MY HEAD, COMPLAINING ABOUT YOU, BEING UNABLE TO TELL WHETHER YOU MEANT ANYTHING OR WERE ONLY ACTING. I THOUGHT THAT WOULD SHOW HIM A SAMPLE OF REAL ACTING. PAUL, HE DIDN'T TRY TO SHOOT YOU. IT WAS ACCIDENTAL. THE ONLY THING ACCIDENTAL ABOUT IT IS THAT HE MISSED ME. THAT WAS PURE ACCIDENT, NOT HIS, THE COLONEL'S. I'M AFRAID, SIR, YOU'LL HAVE TO DEMOTE HIM, MAKE HIM A CAPTAIN AGAIN. HA HA HA. OH, YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE WORRIED ABOUT YOUR WIFE, MR. HALLOWAY. OH, SHE MAY BECOME INTOXICATED WITH THE WINE OF ROMANCE, BUT YOU, YOU WILL ALWAYS BE THE MORNING AFTER. YOU SHOULD HAVE ASKED ME ABOUT HER. THEN YOU WOULD HAVE BEEN SAVED THE EMBARRASSMEN OF TRYING TO MURDER ME. PAUL, IT'S NOT TRUE. I SAW IT. IT WAS AN ACCIDENT. YOU MUST BELIEVE IT. YES... YES, MR. HALLOWAY, SHE MEANT IT, THE THINGS YOU DOUBTED. SHE MEAN EVERY WORD OF THEM. SHE LOVES YOUR STRONG, MANLY WAYS AND YOUR STALWART BANK ACCOUNT. SHE LOVES YOU VERY DEVOTEDLY WITH HER WHOLE, SIMPLE HEART, GOD BLESS HER. GOODBYE, ETHEL. YOU'RE NOT GOING TO DO ANYTHING ABOUT THIS? NOT A THING. ORMAN, I DON' KNOW WHAT TO SAY. WHEN YOU DO, SAY IT TO HER IN A CANADIAN MOONLIGHT. GOOD NIGHT, MR. HALLOWAY. GOOD NIGHT, CAPTAIN. GOOD NIGHT. ALL OVER? YES. WHERE TO NOW? WHAT'S THE MATTER? WHAT'S THE MATTER? WHY, YOU'RE BLEEDING. YOU'VE BEEN SHOT. WHAT'S HAPPENED? ARE YOU HURT BAD, MR. ORMAN? WHO DID IT? WHY, YOU'RE SOAKED! CAN YOU TALK, MR. ORMAN? YES, YES. STOP YELLING. WHY, THEY SHOT YOU. YEAH. SPOILED MY NEW SUIT. FINEST SUI I EVER HAD. IT'S MY FAULT. I PUT IT ON THE WRONG DUMMY. I'LL GET A DOCTOR. NO, ST. LUKE'S HOSPITAL. STEP ON IT. REMEMBER, AN ACCIDENT. NO PUBLICITY. I DON'T WANT YOU TO SPOIL MY SCENE. HA HA. I WAS SUPERB. AND THAT GUY SAID THIS SUI WOULD BRING YOU GOOD LUCK. AHH... PERHAPS IT HAS. YES! YES! WAIT A MINUTE AND I'LL GET YOU AN ASPIRIN. GOOD MORNING, EDGAR. OH, IT'S YOU, LUTHER. HELLO. IS IT, UH... IT'S ALL RIGHT TO COME IN. MR. WILSON'S STILL ASLEEP. LOOK OUT FOR BROKEN GLASS. WHAT HAPPENED AROUND HERE? MR. WILSON GETS MARRIED TONIGHT. OH, OF COURSE IT'S TONIGHT. WAS THE BACHELOR DINNER HERE? IT JUST AS WELL HAVE BEEN. MR. WILSON BROUGHT BACK SOME FRIENDS AFTERWARDS FOR A NIGHTCAP. HA. THEY SEEMED TO HAVE HAD A LITTLE TROUBLE GETTING ONE TO FIT. WHAT'S HAPPENED TO THE LIVING ROOM? THE GENTLEMEN WERE USING IT AS A STADIUM. THEY THOUGHT IT BES TO PLAY SEVERAL QUARTERS OF A YALE-HARVARD GAME. HA HA HA HA. THESE WERE THE GOAL POSTS. DID ONE OF THEM FALL ON YOU? OH, THIS? THAT OCCURRED WHEN THE GENTLEMEN DECIDED TO PUT ME IN THE LAST FEW MINUTES OF PLAY. A SCRIMMAGE? NO, THEY GAVE ME THE BALL AND I MADE THE MISTAKE OF RUNNING THE WRONG WAY. THAT'S DANGEROUS. I KNOW THAT NOW. MR. WILSON PERSONALLY TACKLED ME. HE WAS AN ALL-AMERICAN. A TRIPLE THREAT. WHERE ARE YOU TAKING THAT? HERE, TO YOU - THE VERY THING TO WEAR TO THE WEDDING. MR. WILSON HAS HIS OWN TAIL COAT. YOU MIGH LIKE TO WEAR I AS A MARK OF RESPEC FOR YOUR EMPLOYER. ANY RESPEC I HAVE FOR MR. WILSON CAN BE EXPRESSED BY WEARING SHORTS. TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH, I NEED $10. I THOUGHT I COULD LEAVE THIS AS HOSTAGE UNTIL I GE PAID SATURDAY. ALL RIGHT, LET'S HAVE A LOOK AT IT. THIS IS MR. ORMAN'S COAT. YES, BUT HE DOESN' NEED IT IN THE HOSPITAL. WHAT'S WRONG WITH HIM? SOMETHING OF A PERSONAL NATURE. ISN'T I A BEAUTIFUL COAT? MMM, YES. DO THEY MAKE ALL THESE COATS WITH HOLES IN THEM? HOLES? MUST BE A MOTH. PRETTY BIG MOTH. MR. ORMAN ALWAYS HAS THE BEST OF EVERYTHING. YES, INCLUDING .32 CALIBER MOTHS. NOW, SEE HERE, EDGAR, EITHER YOU LOAN ME THE $10 AND KEEP THE COAT, OR YOU DON'T. THERE'S NO NEED TO QUIBBLE. I'M NOT. I HAVEN'T TIME TO QUIBBLE OR NOT TO QUIBBLE. ANOTHER INTERRUPTION. EDGAR, FOR THE SAKE OF OUR LONG FRIENDSHIP... EDGAR, I SAY FOR THE SAKE OF OUR LONGSTANDING FRIENDSHIP- ALL RIGHT. BUT OUR LONGSTANDING FRIENDSHIP ENDS IF YOU'RE NOT HERE ON SATURDAY WITH THOSE 10 BUCKS. THANK YOU, EDGAR. THANK YOU. GOODBYE. GOODBYE- OH, I SAID HELLO. OH, GOOD MORNING, MISS DIANE. UH, WELL, YES, MR. WILSON IS HERE- DON'T GO ANY FARTHER. I KNOW THAT TONE. IT MEANS MR. WILSON IS STILL ASLEEP. YES, UH... STOP MUMBLING. JUST REACH OVER AND VERY FIRMLY PRESS THE BUZZER. WELL, WHO CARES ABOUT HIS HEAD? OH. HELLO? OH, HELLO, BABY. HOW ARE YOU? AND WHO ARE YOU? ONLY THE GIRL YOU'RE GOING TO MARRY. NOW, GET UP, DARLING. YOU HAVE A LUNCHEON DATE WITH ME, REMEMBER? I TAKE IT BY THA GARGLING SOUND YOU DO. WHAT TIME IS IT? IT'S 11:25, THE DAY IS TUESDAY, THE MONTH IS SEPTEMBER, THE LARK'S ON THE WING, AND I'VE GOT A DATE TO BE MARRIED TONIGHT. YES, DARLING. WELL, I'LL SEE YOU IN A LITTLE WHILE. GOODBYE. ASLEEP AT THIS TIME OF THE DAY. MARK MY WORDS- A GROOM THAT SLEEPS MEANS A BRIDE THAT WEEPS. THAT'S A HAPPY THOUGH FOR MY WEDDING DAY. HELLO, ELLEN. HELLO. AH, DIANE, MARRIAGE STINKS. THAT'S ANOTHER HAPPY THOUGHT. WHAT'S THE MATTER, ELLEN? OH, EVERYTHING. MY HANDKERCHIEF IS SOAKING WET. GET ONE OF MINE. A TOWEL WOULD BE MORE PRACTICAL. HA HA HA HA. THIS IS NOTHING TO JOKE ABOUT. I'M MISERABLE. I'M GOING TO DIVORCE JIM. HE KNOWS I'VE ALWAYS HATED WOMEN WITH RED HAIR. OH, THERE'S A WOMAN WITH RED HAIR. THAT'S A RELIEF FROM THE USUAL MENTAL CRUELTY. HOW DO YOU KNOW SHE HAS RED HAIR? I FOUND A COMB STAINED WITH HENNA IN THE POCKE OF HIS TAIL COAT. SHE DOESN'T EVEN HAVE REAL RED HAIR. AND WHAT WERE YOU DOING IN HIS TAIL COAT POCKET? WHAT WAS I DOING? NOTHING. I- DID YOU FALL IN? I HAPPENED TO BE LOOKING FOR SOME STAMPS. THE POST OFFICE IS TOO FAR AWAY? DO THEY USUALLY CARRY STAMPS IN THEIR TAIL COAT POCKETS? YOU'D BE SURPRISED WHA THEY KEEP THERE. ONCE JIM- THAT SOUNDS LIKE A LONG STORY. I'VE GOT TO GET DRESSED. COME TO HARRY'S WITH ME. I'M TOO GLOOMY TO GO ANYWHERE. THIS IS MY WEDDING DAY. YOU'LL BE THE "SOMETHING BLUE" THAT BRINGS GOOD LUCK TO THE BRIDE. I'LL TELL MR. WILSON YOU'RE HERE. DON'T WAKE HIM ALL THE WAY UP. I JUST WANT HIM TO LOOK AT ME FOR A SECOND. HE'LL HAVE DOUBLE VISION AFTER HAVING THIS. WHAT'S THAT? UM, A HEALTH DRINK. JUDAS! WHAT'S IN IT BESIDES EMBALMING FLUID? TABASCO SAUCE, SPIRITS OF AMMONIA, RED PEPPER, BRANDY, AND, UH, A JIGGER OF MILK. I SUPPOSE IT'S THE MILK THAT PACKS THE WALLOP? I'M SURE IT IS, MISS DIANE. OH, ELLEN, CHEER UP. HOW CAN I BE CHEERFUL WHEN I KNOW WHAT I KNOW ABOUT JIM? WELL, IN A WAY, IT DOES SERVE YOU RIGHT. YOU SHOULDN'T BE LOOKING IN HIS POCKETS. YOU NEVER LOOK IN HARRY'S POCKETS? THE SUBJEC HASN'T COME UP YET. WHEN IT DOES, I ASSURE YOU- WELL. WELL, WHAT? THE SUBJECT'S COME UP, DEAR. WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO ABOUT IT? I'M NOT GOING TO DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT. BECAUSE YOU TRUST HARRY IMPLICITLY, I SUPPOSE? EXACTLY. MM-HMM. I WISH I'D HAD THIS CHANCE BEFORE I'D MARRIED JIM. THINK OF THE TIME IT WOULD HAVE SAVED ME. THINK OF THE TIME IT MIGH SAVE YOU, IF YOU LOOK. WHY, THAT'S A TERRIBLE THING TO SAY ABOUT HARRY. LISTEN, YOU'D BE LOOKING THIS VERY MINUTE IF YOU WEREN' AFRAID I WAS RIGHT. I DON'T THINK YOU ARE. YOU DON'T BELIEVE ME? UH-UH. ALL RIGHT, I'LL SHOW YOU. STAMPS. UH, WHAT DID I TELL YOU? I DON'T SEE WHY HARRY CAN'T KEEP STAMPS IN HIS TAIL COAT IF HE WANTS TO. THERE'S NO LAW AGAINS MAILING LETTERS AFTER 9:00. A HATCHECK. NOTHING INCRIMINATING ABOUT THAT, EITHER. LOTS OF MEN TAKE THEIR HATS OFF INDOORS. A HANDKERCHIEF. STOP TELLING ME WHAT EVERYTHING IS. I KNOW A HANDKERCHIEF WHEN I SEE ONE. HOLD IT UP. NOT EVEN A TRACE OF ANY LIPSTICK. KEEP ON. CIGARETTES, MATCHES, AND... 13 CENTS. YOU CAN SEE I'M MARRYING HIM FOR HIS MONEY. KEEP GOING. THERE'S NO PLACE ELSE TO GO. OH, YES, THERE IS. THE MOST CRITICAL POCKET OF ALL. THIS IS WHERE I FOUND THE COMB. REALLY, ELLEN, THIS IS GETTING... LOOK, WHA DID I TELL YOU? OH, IT'S JUST A BILL. HAVE THEY STARTED PUTTING PERFUME ON BILLS? IF THEY HAVEN'T, IT'S HIGH TIME THEY STARTED. OH, NO, YOU DON'T. IF YOU WON'T, I WILL. "MY PASSIONATE LION." YOU THINK I MADE IT UP?

I SHALL BE DELIGHTED, UNLESS BROWNE WOULD PREFER ME AS A CHARACTER WITNESS. JUDGE, YOUR HONOR, YOU'RE IN SESSION. ALL RIGHT. WHAT'LL IT BE WORTH FOR ME TO DEFEND YOU? THE JOKE'S GONE FAR ENOUGH. LET'S GET BACK TO OUR SINGING. THE PRISONER COULD EASILY PUT A STOP TO I BY PERMITTING HIMSELF TO BE SEARCHED. CLEAR THE WITNESS BOX. GENTLEMEN, I DECLARE THIS COURT TO BE IN SESSION. YOU WILL NOW PROCEED, MR. PROSECUTOR. YOUR HONOR... GENTLEMEN OF THE JURY, IN VIEW OF THE CIRCUMSTANTIAL NATURE OF THE EVIDENCE IN THIS CASE, THE STATE WILL BE COMPELLED TO CALL INTO QUESTION THE CHARACTER OF THE PRISONER AT THE BAR AND WILL ENDEAVOR TO PROVE BY THE TESTIMONY OF EYEWITNESSES THAT THE CULPRIT, BY HIS PAST CONDUCT, HAS PLACED HIMSELF BEYOND THE PALE OF DECENT SOCIETY. IS HE ON THE LEVEL? ORDER! ORDER IN THE COURT! SIT DOWN, EVERYBODY, OR I'LL HAVE YOU THROWN OUT! YOUR WITNESS, MR. BROWNE. IT'S UH... IT'S QUITE ALL RIGHT, YOUR HONOR. MY LEARNED COLLEAGUE AND I WERE JUST GIVING YOU A LITTLE IDEA OF HOW WE CONDUCTED OUR CASES IN CHICAGO. EH, WILLIAMS? GENTLEMEN OF THE JURY, YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT IT MEANS TO ME TO BE HERE TONIGH WITH MY OLD FRIENDS OF THE CLASS OF 1917. I DON'T MIND TELLING YOU I THOUGHT OF YOU MANY TIMES. OH, BOY. I SURE WISH I'D KNOWN THAT. I GOT A LITTLE POLICY MADE TO ORDER FOR YOU. HOWEVER, THAT'S BESIDE THE POINT. WHAT YOU'RE INTERESTED IN IS TO HEAR MY ANSWER TO THIS CHARGE THAT'S BEEN BROUGHT AGAINST ME. FRANKLY, I WISH I'D COME PREPARED TO MAKE A BETTER DEFENSE. BUT, BELIEVE IT OR NOT, SPEECHMAKING WAS THE LAST THING IN MY MIND TONIGHT. WHAT I REALLY CAME FOR WAS TO, UH... WELL, YOU MIGHT SAY I WAS CHASING A WILL-O'- THE-WISP. AND FOR A WHILE THERE, I THOUGH PERHAPS I'D FOUND IT. ESPECIALLY WHEN I WAS TALKING TO MY OLD ROOMMATE SOUPY DAVIS AND PROFESSOR LYONS. BUT I EXPECT I DIDN'T. KNOW WHY? YOU'RE TOO SOBER. LIKE ME. MY DEFENSE, SUCH AS IT IS, BEGINS ON THE DAY WE GRADUATED, A DAY IN JUNE 1917. IT LEADS FIRS TO AN ARMY TRAINING CAMP, THEN OVERSEAS. THE ARMISTICE, HOME AGAIN, CHICAGO. THE LAW. NOTHING VERY UNUSUAL ABOUT THAT. NOR I'M AFRAID ABOUT THE NEXT CHAPTER IN THE LIFE OF ONE WHO, AS YOU RECALL, JUST BARELY NOSED WILLIAMS OU AS THE MAN YOU VOTED MOST LIKELY TO SUCCEED. A GIRL, MARRIAGE, A HOME, AND A SUCCESSION OF THREADBARE CLIENTS WHO ALWAYS SEEMED TO BE GUILTY, BUT WHO NEVER SEEMED TO HAVE THE FORESIGH TO STEAL ENOUGH TO DISPROVE IT. MY WIFE... YOU-YOU-YOU REMEMBER HER, WILLIAMS. I OUGHT TO. I INTRODUCED HER TO YOU AT THE SENIOR PROM. PROBABLY ONE OF THE FEW MISTAKES YOU EVER MADE. A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN. OH, MAGNIFICENT WOMAN, WHO HAD EVERY REASON TO EXPECT ALL THE THINGS SHE MIGHT HAVE HAD IF SHE'D MARRIED... SOMEONE ELSE. OH, SO THAT'S WHAT STARTED YOU PICKING POCKETS, HUH? CHERCHEZ LA FEMME. THE JURY WILL DISREGARD THAT REMARK, AND I FINE YOU ONE HIGHBALL. THEN A WONDERFUL AND BEAUTIFUL THING HAPPENED. PROHIBITION. THAT NOBLE EXPERIMEN OF BLESSED MEMORY CAME TO DWELL AMONG US. NOWHERE, I ASSURE YOU, WAS IT GREETED WITH SUCH OPEN ARMS AS CHICAGO. ALMOST OVERNIGHT, BUSINESS BEGAN TO PICK UP. MY CLIENTS- YOU REFERRED ONE OF THE FIRS TO ME, YOUR HONOR. THANK YOU. MY CLIENTS, WHILE NO LESS LIKELY CANDIDATES FOR THE JUG THAN FORMERLY, WERE SUFFICIENTLY WELL-HEELED BY NOW TO BE REGARDED AS THE VERY PILLARS OF OUR COMMUNITY. FORTUNATELY FOR ME, THEY WERE BOTH GENEROUS AND GRATEFUL. I CONFESS, FOR A LITTLE WHILE, I SAW MYSELF GETTING STINKING RICH. BUT THE CATCH IS, YOUR HONOR, IT DIDN'T LAST. WHAT DOES, LARRY? OH, I DON'T KNOW. A GOOD MANY THINGS. FRIENDSHIP... GOOD FELLOWSHIP... ISN'T THAT WHY WE'RE HERE TONIGHT? ALL THE THINGS PROFESSOR LYONS WAS TALKING ABOUT. YOU, UH... YOU BELIEVE THAT, DON'T YOU, WILLIAMS? OH, WITH ALL MY HEART. BUT AS I WAS SAYING, WITH THE ADVEN OF PROHIBITION, TOO MANY OF MY CLIENTS BEGAN TO FILL UNTIMELY GRAVES. WHILE MORE AND MORE OF THE OTHERS BEGAN TO DISPLAY A PRISON PALLOR. IF IT HADN'T BEEN FOR A PRETTY FANCY TIGHTROPE PERFORMANCE, I MIGHT NOT HAVE BEEN HERE MYSELF TONIGHT. THERE'S NO DOUB ABOUT THAT. AS IT TURNED OUT IT WAS A SIMPLE CASE OF DISBARMENT, HARDLY WORTH A MENTION, NOT EVEN IN THE CHICAGO TRIBUNE. YOU GOT THE BENEFI OF EVERY DOUBT. YES. THANKS TO YOU, THE GRIEVANCE COMMITTEE OF THE BAR ASSOCIATION WAS VERY GENEROUS. WE WANTED TO SPARE YOUR WIFE AND FAMILY. UNFORTUNATELY MY WIFE DIDN'T SEE THE FULL HUMOR OF MY PREDICAMENT- A LOSS OF IDEALS, PROFESSOR LYONS WOULD CALL IT- AND ON ADVICE OF COUNSEL, QUITE RIGHTLY DECIDED IT HAD ALL BEEN A GHASTLY MISTAKE ABOUT WHICH THE LESS SAID THE BETTER. AFTER ALL, WHO WAS TO BLAME HER? SHE WAS STILL YOUNG, BEAUTIFUL. I REALIZED I HAD BEEN FORTUNATE TO HAVE KNOWN HER AT ALL. AS FOR ME, THERE WAS REALLY NOTHING LEFT TO HOLD ME, SO I JUS DRIFTED AROUND. FIRST ONE PLACE, THEN ANOTHER, UNTIL FINALLY I HAD THE VERY GOOD FORTUNE TO SETTLE DOWN IN CHINA... CHINATOWN. LARRY. HA HA HA! PUT ONE OVER ON YOU, DIDN'T I, ABOUT COMING IN ON A PLANE TONIGHT? HAD YOU GOING, TOO, SOUPY, ABOUT TAKING THAT TAX JOB. OH, WELL, WHY NOT? THE WHOLE THING'S A JOKE. I MEAN MY BEING HERE AT ALL. I HADN'T GIVEN IT A THOUGH UNTIL THIS MORNING WHEN A FRIEND OF MINE, A NICE FELLOW...
