Cherry blossom viewing. was originally a custom, limited to the elite of the Imperial Court. Cherry blossoms along the river was such a wonderful sight to behold. Although sake was prohibited, it was still pleasant. Having lunch amidst the blossoms. You'll hear people enjoying with cheer and laughter. Gives one comfort and tranquility. However... that is not all. Blossoms not only mesmerizes women and children. But transcends hierarchy and caste systems. So that everyone can appreciate it's full glory. It is said that His Majesty once came to view the blossoms dressed as an unknown warrior. Looked for a bride amidst the blossoming flowers. Whether it's story holds any truth is beyond me. However as this rumor became prevalent. Whenever Cherry blossoms, families insisted elegance in kimonos attire. But my grandmother do not care for such. She was interested in sword fighting craft. She didn't care how others view her much. This is a story of more than 50 years ago. Lady Ito. We'll settle down here. Yes. Lady Ito? Lady Tusue is here. You're here. Yes. I'm here. You can lay down here as well. The cherry blossoms here are wonderful in full bloom. I'm afraid not. With you here. Other men might not approach. What? News have spread. That you were victorious in Hagai dojo. The dojo is now infamous. Because none of the men can beat you. I see. Like the saying goes for anyone who's had an achievement in martial arts. You are a difficult person to get near to. I'll say my farewell then. She is so realistic. Regardless that you're sisters. We'll never find another similar relative like her. Well. As the eldest daughter of the Clan elder. I guess it's inevitable. Well, it's time we return. Why are we leaving so early? If we were to leave late. There's gonna be a crowd returning to the city, Your father will not approve of us returning late. C'mon. Yes. Most unfortunate. The blooms are only fleeting. Excuse me? Forgive me if I am wrong. Are you the daughter of Clan Elder Mr. Terai? Yes. I'm from Hagai Dojo. I've heard of your abilities. Unfortunate that I was unable to attend. Oh! Are you Eguchi ? I am Eguchi, Magoshiro. Pity I had missed the chance. So do I. I've hear that you have excellent sword skills. No. I have learned a lot myself. I consider myself lucky to have won. You're too modest. I would like the opportunity to have a friendly duel with you. I would like the chance to learn from you. Lady Ito. It's time. I'm sorry to have taken your time. Until the next time. Til the next time then. You shouldn't talk to him. You know nothing of him. And he looks of a lower caste. I'm not sure. Eguchi is the top swordsman of the Hagai Dojo. When father took me to look at him practice. No one could beat him. No matter. Even if you were just talking about sword play. You still have to be aware of who you converse with in public. Don't over react, Osa. Anyway, we just talked about swordplay. In any case, Don't tell mom about this. She'll be unhappy, if she learns about this. Osa? Please keep this to yourself. Is this a tale of young love? Take a guess. Unrequited love. A love story unlike another. That's full of sweet joy. We can say that the heart suffers bitter in love. Listen carefully to what I am about to reveal. - With a little sesame. - Yes. - Are they finishing work? - Yes. Lady Ito's home! - That is all. - Yes. Sorry for being late. Welcome home. How was this year's cherry blossoms? Very beautiful. Just like last year. I see. Father? Come in. What is it? I have a request. Eguchi have requested for a friendly duel. Eguchi? Eguchi, Magoshiro from Hagai Dojo. I happened to run into him a few days ago. When I was viewing the cherry blossoms. Heard Lady Sai's betrothed to the Shiraiyino family. At last it's our turn. Is that so. Marriages are all arranged. Speaking of. When's Saisuke returning from Edo? Soon... The Abbot's here. Tomorrow. Eguchi will come over tomorrow. Eguchi? Prepare yourself. Yes. Excuse me? I'm Eguchi, Magoshiro! You're early? Yes. Is this inappropriate? Are you in a rush? No. I'm not in any urgency. I've long heard of the Clan Elders' home. Thought I'll come early for a tour. Hope I'm not being too intrusive. But before that. Let's finish the duel. Yes. Let's proceed to the inner courtyard. My father would be the judge. Most honored. Ready! Begin. End of competition. Marvelous. As you now realize. You still have much to learn. No. She has done well. Give Eguchi a tour of our home. Yes. I will take my leave. Yes. Thank you for the lesson today. The honors mine. Please hold for a while. I've never had someone appreciate my skills. Beyond my femininity. You must be feeling overwhelmed. Towards Eguchi, Magoshiro. Promise you'll never see him again. Lest you forget you have been betrothed. Yes. Heard that Eguchi is also engaged. Let's start practicing the tea ceremony. Let's start off with napkin etiquette. Is Saisuke not back yet? Yes... Hasn't it been 4 years? I think so. Hope he doesn't have learning disabilities. Stop saying such things. Maybe he chose to stay in Edo. Maybe... He has gone to a reputable private school. Or something else is holding him there. Being a adult may not make him a wise man. Excuse me. Please accept my apologies. Due to the recent happenings. Thus was unable to perform ceremonial practice at home. It's been some time since we have acquainted. A good move. She has the Abbot eating outta her hand. She have her way with men. - Heard that the marriage was hasten. - What... Lady Kayo made the marriage proposal herself? Yes. Heard her father's health isn't well. The family have placed a great effort in the wedding. Everythings settled. Marrying into a family she knows nothing of. Didn't they communicate before. No, they didn't. About a year ago in small town, in a tea house called Aoyagi. Lady Kayo was seen colluding with Lord Fujii, Kageyu. Sneaking around in the lateness of night. - Well, she's already 15. - No. She won't know if she won't try. Lady Kayo. Numerous men have fallen for her looks and schemes. I see. I do pity Eguchi's family. Eguchi? Yes. Heard Kayo's getting married to the 3rd son, Eguchi. Family's name is Magoshiro. Do you know him? No. He must not have heard rumors about Kayo's past. Even heard that, Lady Kayo's marriage with the Naito family is for the sake of political influence. For generations, Naito's family had the prestige of taking charge of the lord's business and dealings. And Eguchi's the head swordsman of Nagai Dojo. A marriage of convenience. Even a fool knows. How about this? Texture and lining is refine and elegant. Yes, I see. Then how about this? It'll look extremely pleasing on Eguchi. Lady Ito's home! - I'm home. - You're late! Eh? Saisuke's back from the Edo. What? I'm home. Welcome home. Did Saisuke met up with father? Yes. The two was able to sit and talk a little. How long did Saisuke mention he was staying? Back today. He'll be returning to Edo then. May I ask the reason? Heard that he ran into financial problems. Seems that Master have given him some money. Must have been embarrassed to see you. New Year's morning and evening wear, until the 7th day. Samurai attire. Appropriate warrior's linen attire, the night before the eve of spring. Official attire during visits, linen attire. Reserved for formal occasions. Casual wear for same month on the 24th. Official attire during court visits... Naito? Your presence is needed. Eguchi changed his name to Naito Magoshiro. Naito was quick to climb the rungs. I'm really envious. Even the best sword. Will one day end. Like everything else in this world. You are hereby informed. We have again been given the responsibility for the city's businesses. To act as agent for the shogunate and his imperial messengers. As an officer that was to behold throughout generations. Bear this in mind in the honor of the clan of Naito. You are not to let disgrace befall on this house. Yes. This is your new lord. Kageyu Fujii. Naito Magoshiro I assume? Yes. - Do your utmost. - Yes. News received a month ago, from the Naito's clan. The lord have made their decision. Magoshiro is taking the clan name. Then his engagement to Kayo have to be brought forward. This is what the lord wishes under these circumstances. Now Eguchi Magoshiro will start his political life. We have not had time to consider whether he has become a true swordsman. In the olden days, a true swordsman have a true value in the society. Are there anyone in the clan that possesses remarkable swordsmanship. But a man too obsessed with swordsmanship. Will never grace himself with a proper official placement. This is part of society and life. For the political climate of the country. It's better to forego the pursuit of swordsmanship. What exactly is the way of the warrior (Bushido)? Dilemma. How long have father been in Edo? Because his clothings looks aged. The clan demanded his attention. So it's been 2 to 3 years. During that time mother must've been lonely. Leaving for Edo soon after the marriage. Father did of course end his pugilistic road. Discharging his loyalty to the country. Your father did his part as the dutiful father. Your father was eagerly anticipating the day that you were born. Your father rushed back from town. When he found out that you're a girl. His face froze. I can never forget. Til today, I can still remember his look. The essence of swordsmanship is something politicians will never understand. This is not a subject that can be easily argued. No. The Code of Bushido doesn't mean giving up a career in Edo. Only teachers like yourself can. I didn't distance myself from country service because I wanted to. Just the opposite. As the 2nd son who isn't an achiever. Not getting an official placement. But depending instead on family's wealth. Well, sword fighting for me is more like an escape. If I were given a chance like Magoshiro. I would have chosen a political career. You wouldn't understand. End of lesson! Magoshiro? Let's have a go at it. No. I have matters to attend to. I'll take my leave. These are my recommendations. Hondai Shinogeo!? Yes! Kudira Genjiro!? Yes! Nakanura Heima!? Yes! Kato Azo!? Yes! Akio Tangei!? Yes! Shumaki!? Shumaki Jingobear!? Yes! Sakiguchi Tarohaimo!? Yes! Thank you very much. The old are impatient, no? You did well. On your 1st day. This is wonderful. I'm not talking about his family's background. I know. You're smitten with the Mizuno. Yes... I was here with Lady Kayo before. I guess we won't be coming here anymore. When she marries. It would no longer be convenient to come to baths. You're right. Everything's coming to an end. Unfortunate. Eh? I'm going in for a dip. Alright. Lady Kayo? And Fujii, Kageyu... Let's go. Lady Ito's home. I came back late It's wonderful that you're back. What? Quick. Change up. Excuse me. Glad that you're here. Another bowl! Welcome back. You're Lady Ito. Safe return. Yes! It's been awhile. I've only reached Katagiri this morning from the Edo. It's been 5 years. You have turned into a great beauty. According to our parents. We will be married this coming spring. I had this specially made. A gift for when you get married. There will a time when this is of use. Thank you, father. An order was passed down from the government a few days ago. A request for monetary assistance for the Tonegawa flood project. This is extremely important for the clan. Cornered by the opposition. I'm forced. As you have already known. With the compensatory, Therefore. Understand that I am unable to refuse without damaging my esteem. As we are unable to come forth with more money. Lord Abemoto must not be implicated in this oversight. We need the help of Lord Anzai, Shimano. With his aid. We can get out of this impasse. We need you to deliver this proposal to him. Forward. For such an important task. I had my doubts about your abilities. But you were highly recommended by Lord Fujii, Kageyu. Deliver Lord Abemoto's letter. Have them accept the proposal. Put an end to this. When you're in Edo. Put your heart into this. Yes. Lord Fujii? When you are in the palace. Say the fault is yours alone and shame is upon you. Yes. Keep your wits about you in Edo. Tread lightly but push it through among praises. Amidst manners and etiquette. What will my title of address be? Second in rank. Forward. Another bowl please? Lady Ito. Your husband to be has really good appetite. There's still time before the wedding. He's been eating like this for three consecutive days. Everyone feels happy that his appetite is good. Ogata, Shiro and myself drink together often in Edo. - Right!? - Yes. He has often taken care of me while I was in Edo. The duty is now yours. Right. Thank you so much. Don't mention it. It's late. Hey! It's still early. You don't need to return to Edo for duty. Your home do not possess wonderful wine as these. You're right... - More wine if you please. - Yes. Saisuke? You married a good wife. What are you talking about? We're not married yet. You're cute. Lady Ito's home. In regards to Anzai, Lord Shimano. With great admiration and pride, respectively I plead. This being oversight on myself. Naito Magoshiro would like to propose. With all due respect, please entertain my recourse. Please accept. I beg for your understanding. Your name's Naito. Is it not? Are you privy... Of the burden of my acceptance? In regards to Anzai, Lord Shimano. With great admiration and pride, I am not saying this! You march into my home and serve this to me. Have you pondered upon your action? This is the 1st time I have received such a proposal. Though for Edo this may not be. Of course, I can accept the proposal. But you have done a great disservice bringing shame upon yourself. No. The messenger has brought blood upon himself. Ito? Yes? Naito Magoshiro committed suicide in Edo. Forgive me if I am mistaken. Are you the daughter of clan elder Terai? May I enter? Yes. Imagine my surprise. When I learned Lady Ito wish to see me. And to meet in your room. Would you please sit down. Pain...! Please do not misunderstand the implication. I just wanted to talk to you, Saisuke. Talk? What about? I'm all ears. Eguchi. No. Naito Magoshiro. What? About his suicide? I want to learn the truth behind. Magoshiro's suicide. From what I heard. Magoshiro was rude by gaining an audience with Lord Shimano. So he chose to end his life as atonement. - Is this the truth? - Huh? Was he framed? Framed!? Naito Magoshiro set up? What brings you to this conclusion? Magoshiro's wife. Lady Kayo Have an unadmitted relationship with another man. Who is that man? Fujii... Kageyu? I would ask you to. Help me investigate this. Is there something to eat? What? Can't work if I'm hungry. - Food's ready. - Yes! Sorry to keep you waiting. Naito could've decline, right? No. He can never refuse. Yes! Right away! Why the urgency back to Yokoyama? Not surprising. Official business. I see... Don't worry. I can still slip out quietly at night . - Really? - Sorry to keep you waiting! That was quick. Sorry. Enjoy! It seems that Magoshiro have overstepped protocol. Protocol? This was already passed down. Whomever stands in the way of protocol is bound for death. The order was sanctioned by the clan. Lord Abemoto did indeed approved the proposal.. However. It's a wonder why Magoshiro was given the task. Are they not going to pursue this matter? Wouldn't this reflect badly on the clan? Well, Lord Nagasaka are said to be bedridden at home. With heart problems. The clan does seems to be awfully quiet. Seems that Magoshiro's atonement is ignored. Even by the clan. The Lord Abemoto shouldn't have left this lying down. However. It still bothers me on why he chose this path. Magoshiro was a man of honor. I'll accept accountability for the offense that Magoshiro have done. Please mete your punishment. No. Magoshiro broke protocol and made a grave judgment. And it's the Lord's decision to allow Magoshiro to proceed. Yes. But... You were just doing your duty. Anyway. Lord Shimano was the one that demanded his atonement. This will not reflect badly on Lord Fujii at all. Right. You're too distressed. Don't need to be. However, if the matter is not settled. Magoshiro's case may spiral out of control. This will implicate the Naito Clan as well. I'm afraid they might pursue this matter. Understood. Leave the Naito family to me. I will rein them in. Leave it to me. Yes. I heard they found Magoshiro's suicide note. He took full responsibilities for his own actions. Absolving the Clan and the Lords of all blame and culpability. He has conveniently taken full blame. Otherwise, chaos will ensue. That's the end of it. However, something still puzzles me. What is that? Even If it's Magoshiro's 1st time on this task. Shouldn't he be briefed thoroughly on protocol? How can this be overlooked? It seems that someone deliberately misled Magoshiro. Fear not. I'll find out. Enjoy your meal. Magoshiro's wife is having an affair with Lord Fujii, Kageyu ? Hagai Dojo knows all about this. Hey. What are you going to do? This is not something that I can get into. I can no longer get involved. This is getting too complicated. I can't help you anymore. Thanks for all your help. I'll investigate on my own. It should be a boy. Look! My face haven't changed a lot. Really? If it's a boy. Lady Ito can teach him sword fighting. I can't teach him to fight with a bamboo sword. There'll be lots of people to do that. Well. Doesn't matter whether it's a boy or girl. It doesn't matter to me. So long as the baby's healthy. May I enquire about something? Please, Please. Just let me have a look. Just once. So Magoshiro knows about the affair that Lady Kayo was having. That seems to be the case. Why... Why then did Magoshiro kept his silence? If he didn't want a divorce. Why didn't he confront Lord Fujii, Kageyu? You don't understand. The code of Bushido disallows it. Instead of spending life as a low ranked Samurai. He chose to keep his silence to rise up the ranks. As a man always have a certain consciousness. We are bound by duty as well as society. I know this because I have 4 brothers before me. Oh! I'm not the same as Magoshiro. Really! I know. Magoshiro is after all but a mere human. It's only a matter of time, before he gets into trouble. Lord Fujii and Lady Kayo's affair. Have been rumored for some time now. As you yourself know. The affair's not well kept. Not only does Magoshiro knows. But the Naito clan as well. It's only a matter of time Magshiro and Lord Fujii would feud. As head of the Naito clan. He is both bound and responsible. That's the life of a warrior. The Code of Bushido. Code of Bushido. Lord Fujii, Kageyu have so far been successful in cloak. If his affair becomes public. Not only will his position be threatened. So will his life. Which is why and therefore Fujii's had risen to the chief justice in power. He knows protocol better then anyone. So it was a setup. With the influence from the Hagai Dojo. Fujii used him as a pawn. Through these few years. Lord Fujii have been gaining in power. Because he used bribery to get his way. Bribe? Fujii secured his endorsement for the next five years. Through his monopoly on the trade in Edo. He is impregnable. Don't you think he should be responsible? Fujii is also part of the ruling caste. Lord Fujii and his people aren't to be trifled with. Messing with them means certain death. No one dares. Incorrigible. This is how the world works. I want to see Fujii, Kageyu brought to justice. How do you think we do that? I'll help. No. I'll do it alone. Lord Fujii is also be regarded as a great swordsman. Though can't say the same of his integrity. May I ask? What is the relationship between Magoshiro and yourself? None Mere acquaintances. Just mere... acquaintances? I guessed it as much! May I enter? Signed Lady Ito. Fujii, Kageyu? I have been waiting. Who are you? I'm the daughter of clan elder Terai. Why would the daughter of the clan elder accuse me. Of infidelity. What kind of game are you playing? No. Did you not set a trap for Naito and proceed to have him killed. Isn't that right? Fujii? What do you intend to do? Annihilate me!? A mere woman such as yourself? My father have tutored swordsmanship in schools. So I have heard. However. We are not bamboo practicing. Alone? Yes. I see. Why is the daughter of the clan elder. Taking vengeance for a low ranked samurai? Eguchi Magoshiro saw my abilities beyond that of a women. What's the relationship between you and Magoshiro? Just mere acquaintances. Enough! Another half hour, someone would be walking by here. Stay off the beaten path. Stay on the river. Go through the jungle and you're home. Leave the rest to me. Go on. Quickly. Fujii was executed by someone righteous. Yes. After years of living precariously. Wonder who was the gallant? I heard a letter of accusations was left in his arms. An immerse display of strength and power. However, to defeat 3 men. And then close proximity with a knife. Superior swordsmanship. Indeed. Lady Ito? Saisuke? How's the arm? Better. It's been 10 days since we've seen you. Is everything alright? Hmm? I was here. Huh? Looking at the cherry blossom in full bloom. I'll be a bad host if I'm not there. Let's go! Long after this incident. Saisuke inherited my father's name. And your grandmother had seven children including myself. Yes, those are your parent's friends. Saisuke wouldn't help out at home like other men. But my father's clan rose in the community. Though he was known as an simpleton. It's the view of many that simpletons gets to grow old. What talent could there be. Cherry blossoms are still vivid in my mind. But cherry blossom's beauty are fleeting. The sad thing is. Because after my grandmother passed on. Your grandfather has never been to another cherry blossom.
