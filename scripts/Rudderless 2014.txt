Hold on. - Can you do a dinner run? - Sure. - You know what time it is? - Sandwiches? - How long we going to do this? - We're going to do it until it's right. Gotta call my wife. Stuck in your confines Chewin' it over Caught in your headlights Stop staring... Hey, you seen Stiles? Nah? I guess it's no. ...employees. Not in billing. Not in awards even. We're right back here. I think everyone knows everyone. - Hi, Carl. - Brent. - Good to see you again. - Good to see you, Keri. Thank you so much for coming. - If you wouldn't mind sitting right here? - Sure. You have a presentation pack in front of you if you want to get a sneak peek at... I guess what I'm trying to say, Carl, is that the other four agencies are probably laughing at the fact that we're even in the running for your business. We're not laughing. - Hey, Dad. - Where are you? I'm at the library. - Meet me at the Belle. - No, I got class. Cut it. Weren't you supposed to be riding me about going to class? Hey, I'm payin' for it. I say cut it, all right? Get somebody else's notes. Your old man just knocked one out of the park, and I wanna celebrate with you. Whatever happened to free choice? No, that's a myth. Come on, I'm already in the car. I'll meet you in half an hour. Hey, it's Josh, leave a message. Yup, it's me again. Not cool blowin' off your dad. All right, well, call me over the weekend. Bye. Hey, can I... Can I get some volume on this? Hey, excuse me! Can I get some sound? Can you turn this up, please? A tragedy of this magnitude... Absolutely heartbreaking. And the fact that it happened in our own backyard, unbelievable. We have Lisa Martin on the scene. And, Lisa... - Anything? - No. The parents of Sarah Clark, an Honor Roll student... Well, all you can do is be there for him. ...just passed behind me, obviously distraught. Family members tell me that ever since she was a little girl, Sarah had dreamed of becoming a nurse. - ...quite a bit. - Yeah. They were young, that's what counts. You be strong. Thank you for coming. I'd have walked if I had to. I'm going to be so worried about you. Brent and I want you to know that we are here for you. You have got to let go of this, honey. Just cry. You're just being too strong Give me a call, sweetie, okay? Oh, God. I'm sorry. Ms. Tamburg said I could come up. I'm Kate. I was Josh's... Sod of, we dated. For about a year. That's me. You're his dad, right? You're Sam. He spoke about you. Highly of you. He was really sweet to me. He was always very sweet to me. Honey. I'm sorry. - I'm so sorry. - I know, honey. I just don't know what I'm supposed to do. I know. Okay! It's him. We got him. All right, let's rock and roll. Okay, lemme get a three-quarter shot. Good, good, good. Catch him out of the car. Catch him out of the car. Mr. Manning! Have you spoken to any of the other parents? Has anybody been in contact with you? Mr. Manning, how was the funeral? Just a statement. Mr. Manning! Mr. Manning! Please, just one second. Mr. Manning, how is your ex-wife? Fuck! Oh, shit. Hey, excuse me. Do you have a back way out? Yeah... An exit? You do? Oh, never mind. Just keep it. Mr. Manning? Mr. Manning! I hate to bother you. Oh, yeah? Well, if you hated it so much, you wouldn't be doin' it, would you? Do you feel that the school bears any responsibility for... You know, lemme ask you a question first. You're a headless, bottom-feeding motherfucker. Well, I guess it's not really a question, is it? - Sam. - Hey. I'm fine. I'm okay. I'm serious. Hey, hey, hey. - Sam! - Does that seem like I'm not okay? You shouldn't be here, okay? You should probably go home. Hey, hey. Wanna come inside? Check how fine I really am. Sam! How nice to see you, too! She can't keep her hands off me. - Professional help. - Yes, yes, yes. How many times did you go see him? Well, I mean, I didn't actually see the guy yet, but... I didn't see him, but I did talk to him on the phone, and... Nice guy. Listen. We're doing fine here. Take the time that you need to... Hey, hey. I appreciate that concern. I really do. But what I need is to work. What I need is to come in here every day and I'm gonna sell some tacos. Okay? I gotta write some catchy copy and I gotta put on a suit, tie and smile. Face the future. That... That's what I need. Sam, I need to talk to you. Late for work. Catch me tonight. No, this is important. Late for work, doin'. No, this is important! I implore you. We can walk and talk. Was beginning to wonder if you needed a written invitation to come to work today. No invitation necessary. Days with these fine gentlemen is what I get out of bed for. Don't be late again. You know what I'm sayin'? Don't be late again. Yeah, you wouldn't wanna lose this job, huh? You wanna get a beer after work? Me and Carlos are gonna go over to Trill to get some. I don't drink. You best check your cologne, because you smell like you drink. Evenin'. Don't call me whore in the morning Don't call me baby when you want me in your bed Then you leave me at 4:00 in the morning I should have kicked you in the balls instead Then you tell me that you're sorry And that the girl that I saw you at the Walmart with wasn't anybody... Hey, man, I didn't think you were gonna make it. Yeah, what you drinkin'? I'm gonna get a Mustang Wheat. No lemon. Wheat? But I talked to your cousin and she told me that that girl is a whore You're a whore! She's the whore! She's the whore! Don't call me whore in the morning Don't call me baby when you want me... So what's your story anyway, man? I mean, why you paintin' houses? And don't give me that shit about NASA again. All right, promise you won't tell? I'm in the witness protection program. I fingered Gotti. Fine. Don't tell me. I don't give a shit. Dick. As a reminder not to date assholes And throw my life away I'm not the whore! You're the whore! You're the whore! Thank you. Okay! That was... That was Peaches. Thank you, Peaches. Next we have Nic Harvard. Nic! Come on up! It was a long, long time ago and far, far away I guess you could say it was like every other day Found myself on broken streets wanderin' around Lookin' for a place that I can lay my troubles down Hey, stranger. You're not really gonna stroll up acting like we're running into one another at the mall? This is gonna be one of those moments where no matter what I say, it's wrong, isn't it? Tell me, Sam, how should I be acting? What is the appropriate tone for having to track down your ex-husband who's hiding out two and a half hours away on a boat? I'm not hiding. - You're not hiding? - What do you want, Em? Your signature. I'm putting the house on the market. And I'm here. And I'm tired. And I have a long drive ahead of me. Could've forged it. You're right, I could've. Maybe I was worried about you. - Should I be worried? - I'm fine. Come on, I'm livin' the dream. On a boat. It's marked everywhere I need a signature. His name's Phillip. Wow. Okay. Yeah. He's 11 months old. That's fantastic. He is a miracle. A $200,000 miracle, but he is a beautiful, healthy boy. We're moving to Tulsa. Tom's dad isn't doing so well. That's great. I mean, I'm sorry. And I finally decided to let go of a few things. I saved this for you. Music was always you guys' thing. I couldn't even open the boxes. Hold on, I don't have room for that. - What do you mean? - Like, the boat. It's not big enough. - Sorry. - You can't be serious. What do want me to say? I don't know. It took me over two years to get to a point where I can clean out his room, and you, you don't care about his stuff? - That's not fair. - Isn't it? Well, get pissed! It's not going to make my boat any bigger. No! No! If you wanna act like Josh never existed, if hiding makes it easier for you, great. But make no mistake, you are hiding! Darkness, don't give way to the light I wish I may, I wish I might Stay with you, with you We'll shine so bright Just raise your glasses and drink one to the night It's so... Well, I'm tryin' to get home But it feels like another life Yeah, I'm tryin' to be strong Sometimes I realize That the further I go The more that I know That I wanna go home Well, I'm packin' my bags Another day and another town What a fool I am Can't seem to settle down Cause the further I go The more that I know That I wanna go home And the further I go... The further I... The further I go The more that I know That I wanna go home Hey, what do you say there, Alard? It's Alaird. These are the kind of days worth working for, huh? - I just wanna be forthright and honest. - Oh, good. I had to file another complaint about you relieving yourself in the lake. - The rules are quite clear. - Alard, do you realize how many of our conversations are about my penis? You're not nearly as funny as you think you are. This is a family lake. You've been warned. Don't say a word about your plans Maybe I don't give a damn Don't say a word about your plans... You here to play? Just you? Sign-up's right there. Can I get a Mustang Wheat? Brian, that was terrific. I hate to say this. I love it when women break your heart, because you write beautiful love songs about 'em. Give it up for Brian. No lemon. Maybe I... I should stay I'm better off your way But I'm not givin' up Show your faith You got a lot of nerve To come around here That was fantastic. Tolly and Tina, everybody. Next we have... Alard Dick. - Tolly, that was really nice. - Thanks. Well, I'm trying to get home But it feels like another life Yeah, I'm trying to stay strong And sometimes I realize That the further I go The more that I know That I wanna go home Well, I'm packin' my bags Another day and another town What a fool I am Can't seem to settle down 'Cause the further I go The more that I know That I wanna go home You can't take that outside. Excuse me? Excuse me. That was awesome. And when I say awesome, I mean "hairs on my neck stand up" awesome. I wanted to say something to you earlier, but you look scary. - I'm glad that you liked it. - Oh, yeah. I'm not blowing smoke. That song had something going on. Something deep. I'm Quentin. Well, good to meet you, Quentin. Don't let the brain dead back there get to you. I mean, they... I'm here every week and they wouldn't know greatness if it... They just wouldn't know it. They wouldn't know it. I don't mean to be rude, but you're quite drunk, Mr. Dick. Do you want me to give you a ride? Oh, crap. Crap. Hey! - So you gonna come back and play? - Thank you for the ride. Knock, knock. Hello. Hello? - Hello! - For fuck's sake. You're supposed to be invited on board. - Sorry, sorry. - Stop. Come back. - Is that for me? - Yeah. I thought you might like a donut. Buck's Space Age. They're like edible heaven. Good, as in I'd have one over sex. Well, you're doing it wrong, then. So is this even legal? Not that. That is not even sanitary. I mean, living on a... You're here to give me a ticket, Quentin? No. No, no, no. And I'm not like your newest stalker or anything. I just... I just can't get that song out of my head. 'Round and 'round and around and I'm laying there and I think, "What it needs is a harmony." Nothing over the top. Just simple. And then I think, "if that song is that good, there have to be others." And if there are others, someone ought to play them. - We could play them. - Let me stop you right there. I'm not interested. Sure, no. Right. Totally, I get ahead of myself sometimes. - Are there other songs? - Thank you for the coffee. Sure. Just to clarify, you don't want to play at the Trill again, or you don't want to play with me? Thank you for the coffee. Yeah, yeah. You're my sidekick You're my alibi You're my right-hand man I'm your homeboy I'm your main dude I'm your best laid plan When the shit hits the fan Could I make you understand? I don't know Wife kick you out? - Excuse me? - You're here every week for a shower. - Wife pissed at you? - No. Nope. No wife, no kids. Live on a boat. Sexy for everything except for taking a shower. Mr. Dick? Sorry, sorry. I didn't mean to scare you. It's Quentin, in case you forgot. I have to put a bell around your neck. I missed you the other night. Kinda held out hope. You know, I don't get the appeal of fishing. Really. Well, I would imagine that most activities performed in silence don't make much sense to you. Permission to come aboard? If I say yes, you promise to help with dinner? - Done. - All right. Here, clean these. Mr. Dick, I don't know if I can do this. Don't call me Mr. Dick. - Okay, Alard. - Don't call me Alard either. Well, if I need to talk to you, should I just whistle? - Call me Sam. - Okay, why not? Think you can handle that? You never told me if you've written others, but I'm guessing you have because it doesn't really sound like a first try kind of tune. Back to this? What I don't understand is you don't write stuff like this if you don't want people to hear it. I don't know where the days have gone But I know I wanna go home No, it's not... "But I know where I belong." I know where I belong - Right? - Yeah. I want to go... Do that pad, do the last pad again. I don't know where the days have gone But I know where I belong I wanna go home Fuck! Wait, go back to the pad. No, no, no, the... Would you still be my friend if I broke into your house Pissed in your shoes And relieved you of your eyebrows? Do that, I like that. I'd still be friends with you What don't you understand about, "Do that"? 'Cause that's what real friends do - Anyway, thank you. - Yeah, thank you for coming by. - Those were good jams. - That was okay. - No, really good jams. - Yeah. - Yeah, it was pretty great. - Okay. - All right. - Okay. You seriously have no desire to go out and play those? - Good night, Quentin. - Just hold on. Hold on. You heard us, right? You can't tell me that didn't dial you up just a little bit. - It was nice, okay? - Nice? Are you kidding... Hold on, hold on. Nice? That was not just nice, okay? I've played with people before, and it's always sucked. It's always sucked because most things, they suck! That wasn't just nice, okay? Are you... I bet that was even better than you imagined... Fine, I'll play the song. Really? If it'll get you to go home right now. I'm gone. I'm out. I'm home. You're not messing with me, right? You're not messing with me, right? We're going to rehearse and we'll play? You're still here. I'm out, I'm out. I'm gone. Hey, your name really is Sam, right? Be by you, be by you All I want is to be by you Be by you, be by you All I want is to be by you Be by you, be by you Hey, you must be Sam. I won't tell you how Quentin told me to recognize you. Well, I can only guess. Aiken, this is Tolly. We met, but you were really drunk. Nice to meet you, again. You know where I can find him? Bathroom. Think he's a little nervous. He does this. Can you watch this? - You okay in there? - Great. Great. Almost done. In case you forgot, you know, this was your idea. Yeah, I know. Weird, right? Quentin. There are 14 people in the audience. And 10 of them are performers. You launching the space shuttle? I worked a little something up. Trust me. Just don't throw up. That's helpful. You're helpful. So, so helpful. You're my sidekick You're my alibi You're my right-hand man I'm your homeboy I'm your main dude I'm your best laid plan When the shit hits the fan Could I make you understand? I don't know Would you still be my friend if I made outwith your mother? Would you still be my friend if I beat up your brother? Could I still be friends with you? 'Cause that's what real friends do You're my defense You're my samurai You're the man, you're the man There's no secrets There's no need to lie Words are not enough to best describe us But when the shit hits the fan Could I make you understand? I don't know You seriously never been here? Oh, man. You are in for a treat. You taking care of my baby? I'd be years into my retirement before you got enough money to take it home, son. You're sunny personality is what keep's me coming back, Del. Well, I guess I ought to be nicer to you then. I think that's the nicest he's ever been to me. Seriously. Does it get any prettier than that? Expensive taste. '78 Gibson Les Paul. Rosewood solid body. Gold-plated humbucker pickups. Pearl inlays. Pure perfection. You stock Dean Markley Blue Steels? I do. Get three packs? Hope you're not in a hurry. I take it he's in here a lot. I've figured I've made a dime for every hour he's spent in here. $18.95. You goin' somewhere there? Got yourself a motor home? That is my missus' dream. She says it'll be romantic. Sounds more to me like getting your prostate kicked for eight hours a day until you're dead. So you're looking forward to it? Can't hardly wait. Willie! I thought that was your truck! - Hey! - Quite right, that is my truck. It is. So what's new with you? Not much. Not much. What about you? Are you still playing with those guys in Edmond? Not for a few months, man. Been so long since I played with anyone else, I can hardly remember. Are you kidding me? You? You're, like, the best bass player I've ever heard! Yeah, well... Seriously, man, don't worry. Some band is gonna snatch you up. You're a magician! So... - Well, it was good to see you! - Yeah, great! See you, guys! What? I don't know if I should be impressed by the effort or insulted that you think you can pull that off. I don't know what you're talking about. Okay. All right, fine. Willie plays bass and I think a bass would really bring the songs to life. I'm too old to start a band. Start a band? No. I don't... We're not... I don't wanna start a band. I just think a little bass would make us sound better. - Can we go? - Yeah, yeah, yeah. Voila. Not bad, huh? You could even park a car in here. You like the Lips? Yeah, I like the poster. Where... Is this your parents' place? No, no. Ruth... I'm sort of the caretaker. My apartment's upstairs. You from around here? No, not... Not really. Do you want a drink? Well, where you from? What do your folks do? It's complicated. Let me see what I got. Got water and more water. Pretty much water. Dude! You killed it, man! Can you give me a hand? - Hey, did you get the chords and lyrics? - Yeah, I got 'em. 'Sup Sam! Good to see you again. - Yep. Hi, Willie. - Let me get that piece. How do you come up with this shit? Oh, they just come to me. You write on guitar or keyboard? Yep, they just come. '60s Marshall? Oh, good eye. You like it? Is Chuck Norris a badass? This thing's like new, man. I mean, crisp. You must've dropped some serious cash. A couple of dollars. You guys ready. Let's go! All right, let's do this. So it goes D to B minor. Sort of circles around a little bit. - All right, I got that, yeah. - Bridge goes G major, E minor, - B minor... - Yeah. I got it. I got it. All right, well, just listen in for a couple verses - and join in when you're ready. - No, I got it. Okay. The angel and the devil Secretly they get along Sitting up there with me in the middle From dusk till dawn I get so confused by it Which way to turn They're looking at me like "Decide which bridge to burn" If I'm wrong or right You stand by my side The devil never knows The devil never knows Listen, listen as you forgive me for the thousandth time The devil never knows The devil never knows Angel in disguise Looking over my shoulder Looking out, looking out for me Looking over my shoulder Looking out, looking out for me It's a long way down Even longer way back up And when the chips are down You'll always back me up You can talk me down Talk me out and talk me up When the shit goes down You'll always back me up Think you guys could put together enough songs to play a full set? Thinking of making you a regular on Saturdays. Seriously? - Yeah! - Yeah, yeah, yeah. Hey, we only know four songs. Well, we'll do covers. Yeah, we're in. Last call, by the way. That's what I'm talking about. Yeah! Hey. Guys. Guys. Guys. Hey, I already have a job. Well, wouldn't wanna jeopardize that. Heard you might get promoted to sanding. Sam? Sam! - Alard! - Moment of your time? Oh, for you, pal? Two. The board has asked me to ask you if you would consider moving your boat for the regatta. There's a regatta? I hadn't heard. Can we count on you? This is the premier event of our season. We'd like you to anchor on the south end of the lake. I'll tell you what. I'll be on my best behavior if you stop circulating that petition, or whatever, trying to get me kicked off the lake. You think I don't know about that? The name's Alaird, by the way! I'll move the fucking boat! - Well? - He's moving the boat. All right. Hey, you seen Stiles? Nah? I guess it's no. Got to get out of this place. Don't know what's in my mind What am I thinkin'? Whatever I say is a lie Should I be drinkin'? Stop fucking singin' - We thought 'cause... - No, I get it. You know, 'cause your boat and all. - I get it. - You don't like it. No, it's fine. Sam hates the name. - What? - No way. I don't hate the name. Man, I told you it was too artsy, bro. Don't blame me, I liked "The Old Man and the Three." Two, three, four... Let there be music and let there be thrills You don't like the silence and you never will So jump on the ride You can feel it inside Won't you come with us? Come all ye faithful Don't suffer the fools We'll sound all the sirens and bend all the rules The stars have aligned Leave your troubles behind you and come with us We will play all night And pray the darkness don't give way to the light I wish I may, I wish I might stay with you Lift up your voices and lend us your ears You know who your friends are and everyone's here Why be alone?

You want me to send one of them over here on my way out? Come on. Look, I can get my head around the stage fright, but not this. They're just hoping to talk to you guys. This is fish in a barrel. So, I'll see you tomorrow? - What's the worse that could happen? - Gee, I don't know. I think looking like an idiot and fainting would rank right up there. Okay, so don't do that. You know, your advice sucks. Does it? Oh, yes, yes it does. Bad. Like, but just listen to yourself. I say, "I'm nervous." You say, "Don't be nervous." I say, "I feel sick." You say, "Don't puke." I say "I don't wanna go over there..." Okay, I get it. I get it. All right, well, first listen. Don't go to hit on them. Go over to talk to them. I just wanna drink my beer. - No, you don't. - Yeah.

Desperate times call for yada, yada, yada... You know, the girls in the Trill. I mean, the phrase "fistful of 20s in a whorehouse" comes to mind. Joyce is my mom. Excuse me. God, sorry. Quentin, I'm sorry, man. I'm really... For what it's worth, you have a very attractive, young mom. You want me to set you two up? It's tough when she shows up. She's got problems. My junior year of high school, we lived out of the car. Wow. She's better. But I will never be that poor again. Seriously? What do you think about these? Man, you're not the least bit embarrassed to be shopping here? - Well, I would be, but they're for you. - No, no, no. Hey, hey, hey. Style breeds confidence. Sounds like a bad commercial. That's Leo Burnett. I didn't do that one. Here, here you go. Try those on. What? Stand still. What has gotten into you today? I gotta admit, you're kinda freakin' me out, man. And try smiling, okay? You look like you stepped in a pile of dog shit and everyone can smell it. Seriously, I'm looking for my friend Sam, maybe you know him. He's about, oh, yay tall, he's kind of a dick. Oh, God. Come on, stand up straight. You look like a zombie. Please. You're crushing my soul. Here we go. That's so dramatic! Hey, how's it going, girls? Oh, God.

Listen, I just wanted to see if you guys were going to stay for the band. We have to work early. No. What do you do? - Teach third grade. - First grade. Oh, wow, teachin' on Sundays now, huh?

April and Lizzie, I'll tell you what. I'm gonna make another round here, see if I can drum up some more people to stay for the show.

No. Imma ride my bike. I'll meet you over there. - Okay, all right. - Okay. What kind of car is this? Is this safe? Yeah, we can all ride up front. Hi. Rudderless rocks! Yeah! You just see the show? You don't remember me, do you? Were you sitting at the bar? I'm Kate Lucas. We've already met, in Josh's room. Oh, my God. It's been better lately. Things have died down. I even go out sometimes, like tonight. Oh, Kate. I go by Ann now. It's my middle name. So you're a rock star now, huh? Except you didn't write those songs, did you? Listen. How could you play those songs? Shame on you! Hey, Sam! I was not expecting this. Shit. Hey. I have to stay ahead of it. Paint thinner's the only thing that... But it's hell on your hands. Tequila? Yeah, I thought it was a good choice for the occasion. Happy birthday, Josh. Happy birthday, Josh. I think for mothers and daughters, it's sweet 16. For fathers and sons, it's 21. Was I always such an asshole? You really grew into it, though. Was I always the ice queen? There were some notable thaws. I had breakfast with one of the moms. She wanted to talk, to forgive Josh... - Em. - She didn't blame us. It was amazing. Don't. Don't. It was like a weight lifting. I've been thinking about reaching out to the others. - I'd like you to do it with... - You know what, I should go. It wasn't our fault. You think I don't know it wasn't our fault? I don't know, Sam. I don't know what you think! Hey, are you okay to drive? We did everything right. We did everything we could. Josh was sick. You might want to dwell on this, but I don't. What does it matter? His fault, your fault, my fault. Who cares? I don't need to ask for anybody's forgiveness. And I sure as fuck don't need to meet any of the parents! Man, you look like shit. Well, hard to look better than a man in uniform. Must have been one hell of a weekend. You know, me and Earl caught the Crimson and Cream game on Saturday. Sounds like fun. Blah. Okay, I'm gonna grab some more water. What the hell you doin'? Well, most people call it a nap. In fact, in some cultures it's considered a real boost to productivity. You're fired, smart guy. Well, if it weren't sad, it'd be kind of endearing that you don't realize I quit about an hour ago. I keep trying to get Sam to go. - Oh, he will. - On the deck! Yeah, yeah. He's not into it. I don't know why. Damn! Look at this boat you have, man. I'm gonna be really disappointed. Like, terribly upset. Naw, I'm just kiddin'. Permission to come aboard? Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. I know. I mean, seriously, man, it's that good. I mean, sooner or later someone's gonna sign us. Real Friends is a hit. We do a regional tour and we're set. You really think so? Fuck, yeah, dude. And we're talking eight to 10 a night. No way, dude. - Yeah. - Thousand? You're not making donuts anymore, man. Don't, don't, don't, don't you worry, no Don't, don't, don't, don't you worry Don't, don't, don't you worry about nothing Don't, don't, don't... Aiken! Oh, fuck. What? I'm not gonna beat around the bush, or pussy foot. I think the best thing to do is say it... Like a Band-Aid. Quick and... Well, not really painless because usually that hurts. But what I mean is... We were asked to play the BUZZ 104 Block Party. Look, we've been more than cool, man. You only want to play Saturdays, fine. You don't want to play other bars, okay, we can swallow that for now, but this is big, man. You owe us. Dude, dude, dude. Wilco. Death Cab, radio promos. Do you know what this could mean, dude? This could be the first step. I mean, I don't wanna think about the audience. Yes, I do. But if Ben Gibbard digs it, who knows? Yeah, they want us to play 15 minutes, three songs or so. You can do this one thing for us. Guys, I know I'm dragging, but it's complicated. I should think about it. There's nothing to think about, man. We need this, Sam. I need to think about it. All right, easy. Stop! There's a pole! I know there's a pole back there! I can see the damn pole. There's a gas thing up there! Don't tell me what to do, I can drive! I've been drivin' all my damn life. Just a little bit, just a little bit. Stop! Son of a bitch! Hey, come on, come on. Comin' back, comin' back! You must be Tina. And you must be Sam. Who are you talkin' to? What are you... Are you help, are you gonna help me? Well, that is a big sucker. - Watch it! - Has its own zip code. Slop! Motherfuckin'... - Let me see if I can... - I wouldn't... Son of a bitch! All right. Man. Did... Did you try... You're... Can you... You need to cut it a bit... Yeah, yeah. Tried that twice. You know, I'm not too old to whoop yo' ass if you start laughin', yeah? I would not think of that. Did you buy this? Test drive. Oh, oh, all right. Oh, yeah, hold on. Hold on. Wait a minute. Go ahead, keep laughing. So it's funny now. Go ahead and laugh it up! Keep laughin', both of you! Yeah, as long as I'm here to amuse you. - I told you so. - Come on, Sam. Sooner I can get you what you need, the sooner I'm done with you. Hey, can I give it a shot? All right, you get it out without a scratch, I'll give you whatever you came for for free. Come on, Tina, don't help him. I got it! You did not. You're full of shit! Have you got one of these? I do. I packed those tubes away. I know where they are. Nice to finally meet you, Sam. And you, too, Tina. Can I ask you a question? How come you're not playing the gig on Saturday? How do you know about that? Shit, that's all I do know about. If Q ain't in here asking me to play the damn guitar, I got to hear him runnin' his mouth about how you ain't playing the gig. Well, I never said I wasn't going to play the gig. I said I had to think about it. What's there to think about? You're a band. It's a gig. - They're not that easy to come by. - I need to think about it, though. I'm just... I'm too old for this shit, man. Wow. What you talkin' about, too old? T-Bone Walker played till he was 77. Died with a guitar in his hand. Well, I don't want to die with a guitar in my hand. Then what you doin' in a band? Beginning to wonder that myself. Hey. Slim! Hey. So what's up with that "for sale" sign in the window? Yeah, man. Puttin' the business up for sale. Me and Tina are gonna do some traveling. Oh, really? Take a look around. See somethin' you like, let me know. You're so emotional You're such a beautiful mess One thing I really hate Is when Sam is really late Hurry up, hurry up and wait Don't be sorry Let's make the most of us Love played a joke on us I wanna play this at the block party. Yes! The man has spoken. - All right! - No. I wanna play Over Your Shoulder, Real Friends, and close with this. - It's not finished yet. - It's finished. That's the deal. We close with your song. When was the meeting where we made you lord and master of the band? 'Cause I think I missed it. It's the only way I'll do the show. It's a good song. Makes me nervous to agree with Sam, but he's right. So it's settled. Count it off. Let's do it. Fine with me, I didn't wanna play that show anyway. Come on, Q. - Come on, bro. - Okay, okay, okay. Fine, fine, fine, fine. All right, fine. We'll play the fucking song. It's a good song. You're such an asshole! Wake up in your favorite shoes Sunsets and afternoons Make it up make it up for me and change the story Stylishly under-dressed Unfazed and unimpressed Carry on, carry on, it's great You can't ignore me Don't stop you're good with what you got You're so emotional You're such a beautiful mess Tonight when everyone is cheering for those songs, how are you gonna feel about that? This whole thing, this fantasy you're living in, it's... It's impressive. - Kate... - Ann. It's Ann, remember? - Ann, please. - Do you even know why I changed my name? Because they kept calling me. What kind of sex did we have? Did we have a cult? How many were there? I had to quit school. Josh ruined my life. - That's what your son did to me. - I'm so sorry. Sorry? Know what? I should thank you. I think I'm finally finished with you and your son. Is it true? Yeah. Today is really not turning out like I thought it would. I should have told you. You think? Dude, we can still play the show, man. Think about it. We're only doing three songs, one of them's yours. - Yours is the best one. - Guys... - Yeah, I don't know what she told you... - You need this. After tonight we stop playing 'em forever, and we never play 'em again. No one's the wiser, but we don't miss this chance. - No one would know. - I would know. I would know. Playing these songs is wrong. It's wrong. Isn't it, Sam? It's wrong. All right, I'm gettin' my stuff. Q, please, man. Seriously, think about this. Come on, bro. Pack up the rest of my shit, all right? You screwed us, Sam. He was... He was my son. Yeah, and you must have been a hell of a father. Listen. Shit. What are you havin'? Whiskey. Neat. Double it up for me, will ya? Well, fuck you. Oh, fuck. Oh, fuck! Hell, no. Oh, no, buddy. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. What the fuck? Shut the fuck up! Ladies and gentlemen, the annual Lake Channing Summer Regatta is underway! Beginning at 2:00. And the silent auction... Okay, a little to the right! Nice. Nice. Looks great, guys. Hey. Do you see that? That's it. You hear that? Hey, check it out! What the hell is he doing? - Look! - Bring it around! Break left! Tag left! - Get away! - God, what is he doing? Break off! What a jerk! You're a jerk! I'm gonna remember your face, douche. What's wrong with you? What are you doing? What the hell do think you're doing? I'm over here. I'm sorry it's so late, I... I didn't have anyone else to call. You remember the university shootings at Smythe Library a couple of years ago? Yeah. You talkin' about your boy, huh? Oh, yeah, I recognized you when you first came into the shop. Just took me a minute to figure out where from. Well, then, you know my story. No. I don't know your story, man. All I know is what I read. What would you say if I told you that my son wrote all the songs the band plays? Damn. I'd say, "I didn't see that comin'." Wait, does Quentin know? He does now. Oh, yeah? How'd he take it? - There ya go. - Well, I can't say as I blame him. Damn! Your boy wrote all that music? Well, what were you thinking? - He was my son. - They were all somebody's sons, Sam. Somebody's sons, somebody's daughters. Your boy killed them. I know, but he was my son. Well, I can't say I know half of what you've been through, man. But Quentin deserves better. I know. My little boy. My boy, my boy. My boy. Oh, my boy. My boy... - You okay? - No. Not yet. What are you doin' here? I... I think someday, Phillip's gonna wanna know who his brother really was, not just what he's going to read. And when that happens, I think you should give him these. Wait. Just listen. Thought you played that old Epiphone. Not anymore. I just wanted to come by and... And say thanks. No need, man. Not even a little bit. Okay. - Okay. - Are those Quentin's guitars? Yeah. Stubborn little bastard. I told him I'm damn near givin' things away around here, but he won't take no for an answer. Wants me to sell 'em on consignment. - Thank you. - Yeah. I forgot to ask. How's this goin'? Got an offer. - That's great. - Yeah. Well... You take care of yourself. - Okay. - All right. A good offer? Heard the donuts in here are better than sex. You're doin' it wrong, then. Can we talk? I'm kind of behind here. Okay. Guess I need to order something then, huh? What are those? Cherry. That one? Blueberry fritter. That first night that we got up there and played, it was like I got to meet a Josh that I never knew. And every new song we played, I learned more about him. It was intoxicating. I couldn't stop. I didn't wanna stop, but it wasn't Josh. It was you. Oh, my God, Quentin. I am so sorry. The last thing I ever wanted to do was fuck up another young man's life. Is that what you think? Well, you can let yourself off the hook for that one. I've been fuckin' up my life for 21 years, man. Then stop. Stop fucking it up. Keep going. You don't need those songs. You don't need me. I want you to keep going. I want you to write songs. I want you to make music. Don't give up because of me. Quitters never win. "Quitters never win"? Is that seriously the best you've got? "Quitters never win"? I... I... That's the best I got. Quitters never win. My son's name was Josh Manning. Two years ago, he shot and killed six people. This was his song. Stuck in your confines chewin' it over Caught in your headlights Stop staring You don't know what's on my mind What am I thinking? Whatever I say is a lie So stop staring Tread carefully Take a breath and count the stars Let the world go round without you If you're somewhere you can hear this song sing along Close your eyes and count to 10 Maybe love's the only answer I will find a way to sing your song so sing along Help me understand the silence We make the best we can of everything Nothing is what it was Turnin' the light on Honesty changes us completely Tread carefully Take a breath and count the stars Let the world go round without you If you're somewhere you can hear my song sing along Close your eyes and count to 10 Maybe love's the only answer I will find a way to sing your song If you sing along What is lost can't be replaced What is gone is not forgotten I wish you were here to sing along my son my son my son my son
