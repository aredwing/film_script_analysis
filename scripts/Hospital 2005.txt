Nok, don't think too much, I think Boy will want you back, trust me. Boy, this place is so lovely. Are you free next week? Next week? A long weekend, no problem. OK, I'm calling to confirm Ae and Nui and we can book the place. Sure. It's a day off and it's also a long weekend. But it's not long enough. You've promised to come, why did you do like this? I have an urgent work to do. It's always the same. Next time, if you don't want to come, just say. No need to lie. It's not because I don't want to go. Nok listen to me, my job... OK, fine, I'll see you in next life. Ae, I got this for you, I think it's beautiful. That's lovely. Actually it's good that you keep going away, I keep getting gifts. And when is your next shoot? I want to take a rest for a bit. If you want to hire me, you will have to wait. Oh well, the golden photographer. - You read this sort of stuff? - It's really fun. How fun? Some stories are so scary you know. But some are like a lie. May be there were written by their own writers. You know, similar to the ghost stories told on radio. Hey actually, there is one fascinating story. You want to hear? No, I'm scare. Come on Nui, tell, I want to hear some. See, I won't tell you, I can tell Nok. Brilliant, now you're not stress, you'd want to stress me out instead. Come on, you want to see me not getting to stress, don't you? Listen, the story goes that there is a road where on the curve... A child waits on the side of the road, just waiting, waiting... waiting for you! Go on, just laugh at me. But what does this boy wants? He said that he's waiting for his relative to come pick him up. Did someone really see this kid? Some people said it's true. Why do ghost have to come and show themselves to the living? Because before they die, they still have unfinished business to do. Her condition is still not stable. Make sure she doesn't get disturb. How are you feeling? You're out of danger now there's nothing to worry about, but you have to take a lot of rest. How about my friend? We still have to see, the physical injuries are not serious, just a couple of bruises. But for the head injury we will have to check again because she hit her head pretty hard with the car. And for you, we will have to do more tests. Nok is suffering because of me, isn't she? Don't think too much. It's not our fault and nok will be okay for sure, trust me. Nui... Is that you? Please stay still. - Please do stay still. - My head hurts. Please stay still and let me give you this injection. Just one moment you will feel better. Doctor... How is the patient? I've given her the injection, she should start feeling better in a moment. This condition needs special attention. Check on the patient every hour and if there is anything abnormal, call me immediately. Please don't be worried. Why it has to be this way? It shouldn't have happened. If only I did come along. Who'd want this to happen? When Nok feels better, everything else will be better too. Don't think too much. I only wanted us to have fun. I didn't think that I'm the person who made all these mess. It was an accident. It can happen any time. And you are not the cause. I think Nok will be unhappy if she knows you keep blaming yourself. But I feel bad seeing her like this. Have you seen my mother? I cannot find my mother. Hey, wait a minute. Let's go back. What was that, Nui? I have no idea. What is he doing, shall we take a look? Maybe nothing, he's probably doing his job, there's no need to follow him. But he looks suspicious. Hey, wait a minute! Maybe there's nothing, let's go back. Alright. Excuse me, are you alright? The condition appears to be stable at the moment. But we will have to do a more thorough check again. Yes. Are you alright, you look like you have just seen some ghosts. - Uh, well... - Oh, there's nothing. Do you feel better? How's that headache? It's a bit better now. When you were unconscious, I felt so bad. If anything is going to happen to you, I will never forgive myself. Don't think too much, it was an accident. And you are still my friend. That's good, when bad things come, they also go away. Have you seen Boy? No. Was he here? He's been here since early evening. Maybe he has gone out. Nui, go and get Boy. - What? - Go and look for Boy. - Me? - Yes. OK... If it's broken why put the damn thing here? Oh well, there goes our holiday. There'll be next time. I think you should rest. We still have plenty of time to chat. If I was there, things like this might not have happened. I shouldn't have let you go. Excuse me, your relative is awake. Nui, I saw a ghost. Me too. I think it's kind of strange here. What shall we do? Why do I have to come across this kind of stuff? Hey, shall we just leave? And how are we going to do that? What about Nok? Excuse me. Do you see my mother, I still cannot find my mother. No! Why don't you ask that nurse at the information desk? Why did you talk to that boy like that? Maybe he really needs some help. I just... Kid, when was the last time you seen your mother? Hey wait... Is it the person? Yes. We have tried to contact his relative and we only managed to get on you. Nurse, please help with the procedure. What are you doing here? Why does thing like this had to happen to us? That is Nok! What is going on? The patient developed some complication, possibly internal bleeding we might have to do some surgery. Excuse me, I have to call the doctor. You go and get Boy, I'll go with Nok. Hey, this is a good chance. The operation went well. And while we are waiting. You can make some mistakes, no one will know. Better not, I don't want to do this anymore. You can't do this, you have promised me. And the last time, you made some mistakes on the kidney that has been ordered. You don't care if someone might hear? Fine, but please, let this be the last time. What did you say? I think we have to do something. What are you talking about? Such thing has never happened in our hospital. But doctor... Do you have any proof? We can sue you for this false allegation. Doctor, you think they might know about our hospital? How can you do this? That is a human life. What if it is your own? Please Nuan, do understand. If I won't do this, where can I find the money to pay off my debt. But what you are doing is morally wrong. And it's illegal. How can I explain this to you so that you can understand? I invested in my business but it didn't work. Now I owe many millions. Do you think I can pay that off with the doctor's salary? And when will be able to pay debt off? And when can we get married? Of course I do understand what you are saying, but I want you to find other ways. I'm so afraid you are going to get caught. OK, I will try to find other ways. I promise. I will stop doing this. But it is late now. Why don't you go back first. I still need to see my patient in the main building. How can I go by myself, it's very late now. It will be fine. Just take my car. I don't think I will need it tonight I might have to sleep here anyway. Alright then. I am afraid visiting time is over. Why don't you go back first and come back tomorrow. I shouldn't have let you go on your own. Nuan, I am sorry. - What shall we do? - We have to find some sort of proof. Hey, that's the same box. Shall we follow it? Hey Miss, what's in that box? Miss! You better think about this carefully. The patient relative will pay you lots of money if we can find them a kidney. You can use that to pay off your debt. And I can use the money to open my own clinic. And if you think about it, we are not doing anything wrong. The owner of the kidney is not going to make it anyway. Instead of throwing it away, we take it out and make use of it. Think carefully. This body here has severe burnt on one side, and died very recently. His organs are still intact. Maybe we should try with this one. This old lady here is already brain dead even though she is still breathing. But she doesn't have that much money. And I doubted that her children will want to keep her. I think what we're doing is helping. We are not doing anything wrong. Her kidney is not good enough. She is too old. But there is a girl just brought in ICU from the gas explosion. Her condition is critical. I think we should try with this girl. What do you think? Tell me what I should do. How can you do this? It's a human life here. What if it is you? Do you know I nearly take all these evidence plus the kidney of the patient yesterday to the dean. But I couldn't do that because of you. I can't do this. I... What did you say? If you can't. I will have to do it myself. Dr. Surachai please comes to my office. Is there a problem? It's OK. Just follow me. Can't we just talk here? - Then officer, please. - Sergeant. I didn't do anything wrong, you can't arrest me. This way please. - Let me go! - Doctor please comes this way. We can talk here. Let me go. Miss, it's about your friend. There is something I need to tell you, please follow me. - Nui, where is Boy? - I'll go look for him. I'll back in a moment. Can you please tell me where you got that box? From someone with good intention. You wouldn't believe me if I tell you. Then someone must have known about this. OK never mind. Your friend's boyfriend has gone back earlier this evening. He left a message saying he is going to transfer his girlfriend to another hospital. Have you inform her boyfriend regarding the operation? Not yet. Regarding to the death of your friend. Please contact his family. What do you mean? My friend is dead. Have you misunderstood something here doctor? Please come this way. Do you believe me now? He has succumbed to the injury and died here in the hospital. We have tried our best but he came in too late. There are 3 of them. Can we have the stretchers here? Move please. Please let the officer do their jobs. Prepare basic treatment. The driver is critical. Please move. Can you please make way? Another one. Please be careful. This one is also critical. Come on... Up there, can you please get out of the way? The car lost control, gone straight into there. Are they local people? I don't know. Dead? A guy or a girl? A guy huh? Is there any bleeding? You think he's going to survive? A guy. He's quite heavy. Can you move out of the way please? Easy with his head. Cleared! Pulse is still very weak. - Harder! - Yes, doctor. - He is not getting better. - Harder! Pulse is still very weak. Try one more time. Pulse still weak. Harder. Can you go any harder? Again! His pulse is very weak. Harder than this! Excuse me. When you are ready please come with me to the police station. I need to ask some questions. I like you. Ae. Ae.
