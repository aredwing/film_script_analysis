Quick, I have to do more things with that Tom Macy. Ok, folks, only two, are lucky to buy at this low price. It is one of the best, good luck. I like it. Is it 375, right? No, the kitchen is 475 and double garage, pretty architecture. I think there's someone inside. No, dear, let us talk with Mr. Macy. Let me tell you something, folks, if you made today, it might be good with the price. There's someone inside. It's a nice room. Perhaps the ghost guard. I was still here. Feel at home, give him a look, feel comfortable, okay? I love this. What the hell are you doing? Hey, you gotta get outta here. Leave it with me little friend, listen, Do you think you can mock me and fuck me in business? Think you can do that? Is it what you thought? Bastard, "believed to make fun of me and do what you like, eh? And tease me from falling, but that will never happen. You hear me? And now you take all against me or fuck you without mercy. Do you understand? Do you understand? Do you understand?, Ok, it's all good, man. It's all good, all right, all right. You have 45 days or I'll firewood. Will be best for the business, better to stop, you know? Yes, Charlie, I understand. Yes. Look good, now go to those poor people and now you know you should do is for your benefit. Great folks. In five, four three, two... And for a referendum on the legalization of prostitution, then... We have the following invited to discuss this. Miss Mary Fynch of Nevada Family Association... And Charles Bontempo's' Rancho Love ', the legal brothel. You should feel very proud of his person, a great place for fun. Someone is enjoying a good time now, do not you think? It is the moral pollution of our company operated by people like you. Mr. Bontempo, the way it happens. Always have to bring God, I hate when they do, is so bad that they put in the church. Is all this crap they have there. If I go to hell go to hell, baby, I do not care what you say that witch. Oh, I have to mention that it was cute in a way, all that. I even think I could put him hand and enjoy your beautiful bottom. Now you changed your mind, course. You think so? - Listen we have another letter from the AROS. Want to review the books. "Good or bad? Was easier when we were illegal." Only used to enjoy all money in our pockets. Yes, but do not count those secrets or we get into trouble. Hey, do me a favor, do not act like if you had not ever stolen anything, ok? If this keeps happening I will not be the need to hold the bag. Do not worry too much or will give you a heart attack. I have to leave the ring, I need to fight for food. Hey, Charlie. What the hell are you doing here? This is private. Oh, I did, sorry. I did not know, sorry. It's great this view. Yes, this is where I come to relax. Yes, I can see why. I had the idea when I was in Folsom. Folsom? Yes, in prison, you can see everything. Yes, it looks all from here. The main center. Yes What? I told you I'm sorry. Yes, well, happens. Let me show you something, you see this?, it's great, now I see. Stay here and see if may have good luck. That. Go. I came as a dream a star, so suddenly. You see this?, With some lights will be great... And no matter how far you are, you will see the Ranch of Love. Do not touch it, this is genuine, great job, it can collapse. That is, will the new 'Ranch Love 'anything. It's great, Charlie. Thanks. You know? I never had anything like this, no place to go. You're a champion who makes money. Oh, money. The beams and you lose, you a great life, Charlie, you have. Yes, depending on how you see it, you know? I mean, I've also left things behind. You mean to children? Nothing is equal, all life change in an instant. I'll never have my own team football and say get out to destroy them. My son... Do you have a baby doctor? A great doctor, Grace raised him well. What about you? Have children? Yes, in Argentina. Oh, look. But I do not see a long time ago. Why? Because it is complicated. Hey, bunny, the champion and I we have a little talk here. Back in twenties. Did you see Charlie? No, I saw all day. There are a liar do you? Not really. I'm a big liar. "That bitch has my busy man?" Nor tell, I'm used this shit. - Mrs. You and Charlie are a great team. Yes, of course, are the best. I see that you two are great, I know. Someday I'll have a place like this. Is that your ambition? Great. I travel around the world sometimes they do not know where I am, but here I feel great. You and Charlie are like Dad and Mom and... Girls do not like sisters... but they are great. How did they do with Charlie, all this? You mean I'm doing in a place like this? Leave me alone. Oh, no, please, it's serious. It's easy, my mother was a bitch. Your mother? Do you mind? Maybe. They are so predictable. - How much Charlie takes time with that girl? A week. That's not your problem or did it? Well I care a bit. You are a fucking sick. Maybe. Are not you supposed to should be training? Then go do it. This is a great fight, here we all to witness something spectacular and is with us Bruza to prove it. And we see Muhammad Ali see that is no match for Bruza. Ali and I hope to come and see me I must be who fight, and not that clown white. Bruza, what answer that? All bring flowers to the next. What do you mean? It will be a funeral, Colter small funeral. I'm not white, I am Argentine. For white light for me. Billy Little white. - I will teach the next month differences in the ring. Not even know what it is a ring, small white idiot. Mr. Colter, in my business those who say that have large, is because the are small. She is the manager, guys. Very good, huh? Who is that old? Your mother? This ugly and dirty prostitute. You no longer stand it, whitey. Then jumped to Bruza defend your honor? That's sexy. Nobody had done for me. You're wrong. Once my ex put a coat on the floor not to get dirty, but it was my coat. Who is it? Go ahead. And managed all the roles. Honey, that's fantastic. The system is best with 35, but only for medical benefits. How I'll take care of the twins? Did you go to school for three years to provide the best for your children... And you sit back accepting what they give you? I like it here, Grace, I feel safe, outside is different I do not trust anyone. I will easy for you. What is this? Your payment, you're fired. What? Take it, go to your truck. Give the best for your children, you can come back in six months and be happy but now packed and get out of here. Come on. Thanks, Grace. No problem. What? I had a flash. I see you and Bruza floating on stage and then behaving Charlie like an idiot with his rope magic. You look crazy. - Yes, but let me ask you something, Grace. Did you you were unfaithful to Charlie? I do not know if you noticed but that piece out there is very sexy. That's just like someone else. Charlie negotiated with him by the thousands. Good for him. Sorry, it's my money too. Money is money. Have fun a little, you will not live forever. We saved by the bell. A little love your dog is coming. You have to admit, since he's here have more energy a little more of that pump a little love to the youth. I tell you. Think about it. Do not get tired. I should not teach you that word. Here's what to do, this in a fashion icon, this is a corset Japanese all original design. Girls, this is great money in the bank. Glad you like. This is my magical piece and form a spectacular body for you. Are you tired? Looks like something. Not so much a mile and a half. Ok, but I need a break. Are you okay? Yes, I'm fine. Need more practice if you want to win. What's there? "On the other side? I do not know more of the same, maybe a couple of coyotes. Maybe you did not see the right person. Really? And who is that? "Mr. Wild diapers? "Diapers?" You are very funny. Love you, Grace. Well, it's my job. Yes, it's part of your job. Yes, but do not relax much, get up my car. More respect, please. I wonder if the drivers are... Mind dying as left for the animals. Maybe not as good. Tell me something about yourself and your mother. Finally the big question about whether I am a bitch as my mother. The answer is no. My mother said that in his work there was more money than any other, so I had my first house at 20. I started my business without being legal... And one day I met three girls. He saw me and dropped it. Do not know what to do and waved. Charlie? Yes, him. He told me he was not interested girls, he was interested in seeing me. Then we rented a house he had this plan to make it illegal. He said that would be illegal, we would not have the police with his hands around. Visitors leave enough money. He was right. Yes, he was right. I was thinking about the ranch and need to change many things now. Oh is it serious? If, for example... I do not know why you let your girls not care, it is not sexy. Remain dirty after sex, I heard that and got my thing. So remind me of washing the mouth at all when you return. I have many ideas for make the farm better. May be called El Rancho de Bruza. No, it should not be called that, should Grace called the Ranch and Bruza. Oh, well, Charlie is not going to like it. Charlie? Yes, of course, who needs to Charlie? You see, Grace? We think alike. We are a good team. You know, you still do not know why even with that little man. It goes whenever she wants with that girl. It sickens me how you question. You do not love, Grace, a woman you can not love someone like him. We can be just you and me. Go. What? Get out the fucking car, go, go. You think I'm so stupid? Ok, I'm going out, quiet. Come on, Grace, come on, Grace, come on. Not what I meant, sorry, Grace. Shit. Hello. You. How are you? Well. This is pretty Why did you? I learned in prison. They put me in the right place. Just use old cars. Any shit that people can. Do you sleep there? They own it. Grace said I could stay here without any problem. It was good to know, saved my life is a wonderful person, Understand? Yes, I know. Now talk to she and I will explain everything. Grace, what are you doing? I... Looking for you, girls do not know what to do. Fynch, damn that presented in this program, come here now want to go on television. Why do not you calm down and soothe you? - What? What am I to you? - What is this? A damn shame now? Charlie, I'm serious, do you love me? Grace, we have been married 22 years What you ask me if I love you? Are you OK honey? Is there something wrong? It sounds to me that it was a great torture for you. I want to take a vacation. You want what? I want to take a vacation Just you and me. "As the cruise to Mexico, only you and me? - Yes, was not it great?" Yes, it was great. Ok, let's do it. Well, let's go now. You're crazy, do not start with your nonsense. Charlie, I need you. You're with me Can not you touch me? Why do you have to do all things? Ok, ok, I'll leave you alone. Do it. When I went to the doctor. Hello. Hey, Tom, your sister is here with the whole damn church. It was a great idea. I told you to stop. What? Do what you have to Stop her or do, but you are dead. Look at me. Maybe not what you say or prove it but I love you. I love you enough and I can not live without you. I know that I love you, look what we did together, look what we built. This is beautiful, of course I love you. I love you, I love you and need you I know that it is. I can not go out and fight that damn dog on camera. I really need you you have to do it for me. Ok, ok, ok, I'll be there Charlie, I will. Grace, I love you, thanks. Come on. Walking. This institution legal or not, is wrong. Why do you think that there criminals around? These women have no morals. You bitch, you're on my property. Botarte I can, but in my America taught me that freedom of expression respect is worth more than property. So I invite you to spend and talk. It must be hard for you to understand, Mr. Bontempo, but the people who are with God is interested in their perversion. You are a woman, How can sell their bodies? Miss Fynch. It makes me a favor... And look at the girls. Do not need it. Oh, come on, watch it, do not look to makeup or clothing, watch them as people. Do you think they wanted to be dogs when they were little girls? No, life went through a strong and did the best they could, ok? And maybe being a bitch is not good, but being a liar religious and neither is boring. God will win, so it is legal. God will win, it is legal. How did you get here? I opened the lock. What? I opened the lock. I learned as a child in Buenos Aires... no problem. Why do not you go from here? Grace I just want to apologize. What I said was wrong on the road. I just never met anyone like you... I do not know how to act. What do you want? Do I want? Yes, what do you want? I want to be my manager and I want you with me. Trash. I like you. What do you mean you like me? Just look at me, I am old, I'm not like those girls. Easy. Yes. Hey, Tommy. Hey, Charlie. Did you hear what the referendum? I see better now without problems and yet under control, correct? It's all good, indeed. Little man, indeed. Have fun and enjoy your appointment, it is very nice. Grace, you're beautiful as the first I saw you 22 years ago. Give me that book, please moron. And so sweet. You know how women are. Not everyone has the same character I. - That's the beauty of you. I know. Charlie, I was thinking. You know how we are maybe we should help, Do you understand?, You have some things that I can help. Will you help a little? I do not like anyone's help, especially yours. Do not fly very high, Charlie, say it is hard when you fall. Charlie Bontempo, how you doing? Same shit but different flies. Say hello to my good old friend battles, Mr. James Perez. Welcome to the great struggle. Is it true the rumor that Ali comes over here soon? It is. Now you see everything.

I wanted to see, I wanted to see. I do not care if I die, I die. It's a joke, it's worse joke in the whole damn world. Why is this a joke? I too am dying. What? I have some six months maybe more, do not know. Not true. It is, I have all the tests. Cancer, no one knows, even Charlie. That's incredible. I learned the day I met you. Remember? In the gym.

My mom used to bring here when not drinking. I had forgotten how beautiful it is. Would you think?, Listen to this. That will make us feel better. You make me feel better. Beautiful, huh? What is that? Carlos Gardel. Who? It's a god. Are you a god? No, no, Elvis is a god. Look, here God here Elvis and here is Gardel. "Grace? Charlie." He is not here, why do not you sit, take something and look together? Okay, Charlie, back then. Know this, is not it? What? From his bloody betrayal. I do not know you talk about, Charlie. Did not you know who was with that damn boxer? Charlie, I just found out today at later, but I have to tell you something. I'm happy for her, I hope you have fun and is happening the best time of your life. How can you be happy? Get out. You deserve to be so cursed. Get out. Listen, little man, perhaps pills to help you with your problem. Warren, bring to Jannie, we must do something. Summer season, two small Girl Scouts, I loved it. What is this? It's for emergencies. Nieva enough here, is famous in American history. It is something great here. Like a paradise? Yes - Here? - Yes. In times of Indians this is where they hid, got their food, never before seen a white man. They hid in trees and saw the white food bodies and one of them said: Eat each other. They eat each other, eh? Yes I like this, I can get used to. What? In your hair. No, not horrible. How come the Bible? Did you think that? Yes, every word. I know I'll go to hell and will not be alone. Oh, really? Yes. Who will you? You. Charlie. That's for sure. Almost everyone. You know... what you said was true, We even eat each other. We still eat each other. Harm to people who loved me. I know, I saw those pictures on the wall, I know. They did everything for me. I loved my wife and my son. I said to myself, Finally I have something real. I said, maybe fight once or twice more, and then we moved to Across the country, you know? Far from it. But I'm stupid, Grace, I am a hero in Argentina. Luxuries, women, everything is free. And one day I met a star Buenos Aires theater. It is very nice, I'm a champion. My wife heard through the newspapers... And it shattered. It was with my child. I know, I know, I read in magazines. Might deserve this, my head. I do not know, maybe worth the pain. No. I do not care what happens to me, I do not care to be here. You... And now I do not know how long we have, weeks, minutes. I do not know or care. Bruza, wake up. Bruza, wake up. Wake up. Armando. What? What happens? I have to go back to the ranch. When you farm? Yes. No, no, why? We need to get away from there. I know and I will, but. No, it is a mistake, the ranch has already been for you all we need we have it. I have to go back, I have to fix Charlie, I owe, do you understand? Ok, then go with you. No. Yes. No. You have no idea what he is capable. I can manage to Charlie. Do not worry. What do you want? "Stay here? No, I know a place to take. Come on. Ok, you'll be safe here Charlie hates these people, once stayed and told them all to hell. But he has spies everywhere promise me you will not abandon your room, promise me. I promise, I promise. Ok. Take this. You know, when I came to USA, knew only two English words, perhaps not great, but I wrote it for you. One poem, "I wrote a poem? Yes, I am Argentine. Apart from a boxer could be a poet too. You can read it now, not very long. You are the shield of my brain. You are the cure for my pain. You are my beauty. Okay? It's beautiful. I know. I'll be here. - Ok. - Ok. Grace is back, Charlie. Really? When did? Ok, thanks. Ok, Charlie. I remember this case. Pack up, eh? Did I tell the story he told me Prado on Bruza's wife? He deceived and abandoned, and she committed suicide with her child in her arms, a story in the whole country, Imagine that. Even went to the funeral, because he was too stoned. Never mind, Charlie, none of that matters. Never mind eh, nothing matters. Never mind you think you and imported him in bed? Who better to talk, Charlie? When was the last time you spent the night here? Do not say that, Grace, all the girls I slept I do not care and you know it. You're my wife, never played anyone in our bed. I'm your business partner, is all I was. That's not true and you know it. What about family? Let having children. Forgot? The wanted, we tried. Toma. Can I have possession? That's all you wanted. The other, you know, true, I'll take me. Which will help me survive for long. Now I know why, years ago, when I saw you, I said this girl is for me. You're just like me. You are. Well done, you have everything, eh? Grace, listen, I can understand a guy who comes looking, I fell in love and take care of you, I understand. I really do, and I promise you never I will get between you. Oh, Charlie, I'm dying. You mean this conversation you're dying? I have cancer I got six months. No, less. Grace, you're talking to me, what damn kind of story is that? It is true do you remember the doctor?, I did all the tests, in San Francisco. If all that is true, Why I did not know before? I tried to say it a million times. Charlie, did you see?, I'm not good for you, not the ranch. So Keep it, keep the ranch because that is all I ever wanted. No ranch without you and you're not die is a damn shit. I was dead for years never noticed. I'll see with the doctors, discover your lie. Goodbye, Charlie. Fare thee well, Grace. Have your damn luck. Riva. Riva, I'm Bruza Grace Are you still there? I need to talk to her. Bruza, not back. Charlie is. Who is it, "Bruza? Charlie, Charlie 'Goodtime'. Do not give me that, idiot. If you want to see Grace, come here. I challenge you to come here you and me, face to face, here. I need my car now. Damn. How can you help? Tell Charlie Bruza is here. Where is Grace? I did not think would have the aparecerte ball. I thought this was between you and me, Charlie. I did not think you needed help. Hey, you wanted to talk. I gave you everything and stole my wife. Never steal your wife, you never I stole it, you lost your wife. Really? Grace Yes, I'm here. Bruza ", think I'll let you win? Please, what's on your mind think I'll let you win? You can not take my wife. Why come back here? You're a damned liar. Bruza, come on, come on. What are you doing here? Come on. Grace, I love you, come here. Charlie, we talked about this. There is nothing more to say, okay? You're sick, I can not believe that. I can not believe it. Do you think I lied about that? Walk, let's go. Goodbye, Charlie. We have been married 26 years, Can you talk for a minute? Charlie, we're going now, ok? We go, is... One minute, one minute. Dime. Grace. Let me take care, I did not know you're dying. It's too late, Charlie. Grace. No, no... Come on. Charlie, too late, I do not None of this, I do not want the ranch. I do not want your dreams I do not want this life. We're going the other way, I do not care. But let me take care of you. Listen, I have very short time. - I know. OK? I spend with him. No. Oh, no. Please Grace. Shut the fuck up. Charlie, shit, what did you do? Oh, my God, Bruza, no. Warren, take it in, I'll take care of this. You can not do. Grace, it's all good now call an ambulance. What the hell is happening? Have to go. Oh, my god. Had to shoot in self defense. Liar, liar. Grace, I saw everything. Liar, liar. He killed. What is happening here? Liar is a liar. Water, a little water. I'm sorry, Bruza. They called it self defense. Justifiable homicide, Bruza said he was armed. I told the police what happened, I testified before the grand jury. But it was Charlie's voice to mine, covering with Warren and Johnny, and yes, fighting is over. Bruza's body was taken to Argentina in a military plane. His funeral was so big such as Carlos Gardel. He would have loved that. Yes, I left all the damn Rancho that party shit the others were cowards. But the true local, I sold... And should have been Charlie's face... When they took their cars and all I had. I know that I fall but it was worth. Just the fact of seeing him fall. I spent two years in prison female just as the damned idiot fled the country. He went to Brazil with all their shit. Charlie tried to call me, but did not answer his calls. I could never forgive him for what he did. The only thing he could not predict was to stay alive in prison I had radiation treatment. What did you lose? Surprise. Referral. Nobody knows how long but I take day by day. When I left, I remember everything my mother always told me, if you're good at something goes on that, so we built our Dream Palace. The legal brothel bigger than anybody. Today people come from around the world fun in the new 'Love Ranch'. So even some of my old girls, they returned. You know, when you continue family together. I make no apology for my life, leading comfort and joy in the world... To many lonely people... what still keeps me... Is that through all lives, I know the truth. We had it, he and I, those moments love and truth together, finally and forever. Hey, how many people can say that?
