A girl after my own heart. Goddamn, life is good. Hour ago, I was a dead man. Now I'm drinking warm gin with an angel. So... mm... carny life, huh? Yeah, Chiapas, Durango yeah, the full circuit. You ever been to the States? No, I've never been there before. Well, goddamn, your English is pretty good. That's because of Sam. He, um, he's from London, and so... and because of the movies, they, um, the small-town theaters they hang sheets on the walls and they show old movies on Saturdays at night. Huh. How long you been an angel? I'm not an angel. I'm a bird woman. I don't know, I, um... couldn't get fat enough or grow a beard and I hate snakes, so... just nothing else left. Well, hey, it suits you. Thanks. I'm tired of them, though. What's that? The wings? Yeah, they're heavy. They hurt my shoulders and my back and I'm just, I'm tired of them. Well, why don't you just take them off? Why walk around in pain? I'll give you a hand. It's not... I can do it, it's... I feel like you should leave now. You know? Okay, listen, uh hey, thank you very kindly for the drink. Are you going back to the States? Yep. Listen, uh... if you'd like to get away from all this, you know... you're welcome to go back with me. No, I can't. You take care. Mm. Women. Uh-huh. You got a girl? They're creatures, I mean it, freaks. I found her in the garbage. An infant, wet and crying in the garbage.

Man, I didn't think you could. I can't. I'm too big. I'm too heavy for these to carry me but sometimes when the wind is, is strong enough... Wait, I gotta get a picture of this. Okay, but if I don't like these you're gonna throw them away, okay? I swear to God. Just stand right over there by the way. You promise? I swear! Oh, just like that. Oh. I don't believe it. So what happened to you out in the desert? Oh. Son of a bitch tried to kill me. Over a woman? What else? Did you love her? Absolutely not. Hm. That's kind of sad. How about you? Fast carny life.

I n that old truck you came in. Fuck. Anybody else use this phone after her? Are you a police officer? 'Cause if there's some sort of problem I should call the manager. Dr. Rosenblum's office. Uh, yeah, hey, listen, I'm looking for, uh, for my wife. I believe she may be a patient there. Uh, the name's, uh, Luster. Luster... She's in consultation with the doctor right now. Uh, what kind of doctor? Doctor Rosenblum is a plastic surgeon. Get away from her. Why are you doing this? Please don't do this. What, do you think that I like being a freak? Amazing as she is, it's not a normal... Fuck normal. Since when does normal win a goddamn prize, huh? Lily. You're different. Please don't do this. Please. But I could be like all the other girls. Never. I'm sorry, I think I'm wasting your time. Sorry. I don't ever want to hear a goddamn word about this ever. Or I'll get your address and I swear to God, Doc I'll burn your house down. Thank you. Hey, baby, you still there? I'm here. Listen to me. This ain't no pact with the devil. 'Course it is. It's your life for hers. Oh, come on, that's bullshit. So, uh, being managed by a notorious killer pimp is gonna help this girl. Hey, listen, sweetheart, he can make her rich. He can make her dead. Come on, he ain't gonna hurt her. Why not? 'Cause I'm gonna be there. Please. You can't protect yourself... Hey, listen, just cool it, okay? Nothing's gonna happen to this girl. Happy'll never even meet her, okay? All I'm doing is I'm giving Happy a piece of Lily's future. All right? That's it. He'll make a fortune on this thing. Okay. I'm gonna do everything. He's not even gonna meet her. Hey, listen, he's just gonna get his cut. She know about this? Hey, she trusts me. Okay. She doesn't get hurt. What makes you so sure she can make that kind of money? I mean, this town's lousy with beautiful women. Nate? What makes her so special? What? What makes her so special? Her wings. She's got wings. Uh-huh. And I suppose you have another picture of a jackalope that could be available for the right price too, huh? Are you frightened, Mr. Poole? God, you should be. Listen to me. I swear to God, if I would've known that that was your wife I'd never woulda touched her. I don't have a wife, Mr. Poole. I'm a widower. Yeah. Very sudden. Listen, hey man, I know you want me dead, okay? I don't wanna die. I swear to God this girl is for real. I mean, I don't get it, I don't understand it it's something freaky, she's some kind of goddamn freak of nature. But she has wings. So I get the angel... and you get your life. Sounds... religious. No, it's... it's a little different. I was thinking more you get a percent you get like 65, 75%. You get your piece and then I get, I get my end, which is 20, 25%. And I get my life. And the angel? Listen, she's not an angel. She's just... Theology aside. What's... what's to keep me from just... blowing your head off right now and taking the girl? Hey, man, you don't know where she is. True. Until I get Roland here to peel off all your skin with a needle-nose pliers and then you tell me where she is and the fastest route to her. I don't know where she is, okay? A friend of mine is driving her around in circles, okay? And if I'm not at the goddamn phone booth saying all the right things in 23 minutes he's gonna call his cousin who's a homicide detective and report my murder, okay? She's gonna disappear, and they're gonna investigate your ass, all right? Happy, I mean, you know, look at this like... making a whole bunch of money and doing very little, you know what I'm saying? Any idiot can fake a picture. I would need to see her. Oh, man, no way, you're gonna... I'm no fucking idiot. You're gonna snatch her and kill me. Come on. You have my word. Hm. I have your word as a gangster. As a gangster, and as a partner. Okay then, then we have a deal? You meet me at the opera house, the new opera house six o'clock in the mezzanine. It's a date. Can I leave? Please. You should kill that fucker. Why the fuck did you make a deal with that piece of shit? Wings. What a wonderful dream. Do you come up here a lot? I come up here if someone's playing that I like or... with someone that I like. You know, I knew who you were. What? At Sam's. I'd seen you before. Your pictures. Your albums. Oh. You were famous. Yeah, I was. Handsome. Now you're just being mean. What happened? Man, I just couldn't handle it, you know I just couldn't handle the small talk. You know, the bullshit, all the politics, that crap. No, I just had my music and my dope, and in the end it was all about the dope. And now? You can talk to me. Yeah, I can talk to you. You're different. Yeah. A couple of freaks. Let's just say we're different. Hm? It's five til. Fifty bucks the asshole don't show. Been rocking in the morning  Been rocking all night long  Oh, rocking in the morning  Hold on. Hold on.

Oh, come on now, don't take advantage of me. All right. I'll play you one song. Okay. This here... this here is Hazel. Mm. This is silly. Huh? It's perfect, isn't it? It's like a movie. This night like this. I don't care if the ocean's not real. If you are. I don't care. Huh. Hey, Lily. Would you dance with me? I'd love to. Kiss me. Come on, Nate, I mean a real kiss. Her name was, uh, Annie. Annie Poole. She was really special. She didn't drink, she didn't... she didn't get high. She'd get high so she could be with me. I didn't do anything. I didn't do anything, I just... I just watched her... I just watched her fade away. So how many angels can dance on the head of a pin? Nate! Nate! Lily, Lily, stay... Lily, stay there. Nate, calm the lady down. Introduce us. Fuck you. Happy Shannon. It's a pleasure. You didn't tell the lady? Ah, it was probably an oversight... Our Nate and his surprises. Yes. You see, yesterday, over lunch Nate proposed that we manage you, he and I. Your career. At first I didn't believe him. A woman with wings... I'm sure you understand. But after Nate set up the viewing at the opera yesterday... Hey, I got eyes, right? Listen, listen, it was my only chance. I thought I could... figure it all out and protect you... Nate traded his life for yours. It's as simple as that. Not true. Well, I'm glad I could help. No, Lily. Lily, Lily, Lily. Hey, let her put some fucking clothes on, you fucking animal. Do I have to stand in a lit booth? You will have an audience of one. Me. Now that I've actually seen you you're a miracle too rare and precious. You need to be, like Nate said, protected. You should live with me. I will see to your every need. Please, Lily, please, just don't go. I want you to come to this eyes open willingly, I don't want a prisoner. That's a goddamn lie. It doesn't matter to me. Lily, please, you don't have to do this. You don't have to do anything you don't want to. I don't want him touched. I don't want him touched, that was part of his deal, right? Truthfully, that could be a problem. We don't want him loose in the world. He's a talker. It was part of his deal, right? Yes, sweetheart, but think about... He isn't going to say anything. You and me and women. Get up! Why? - Why? - Why? 'Cause I fucking said so! Get up! Get the fuck up! Dream Lounge. What? It's Campbell's. Drink it. Come on. Oh, God. Jesus. I'm gonna get her back, Harriet. I will. I'm gonna get her back. Sure you will. It's not exactly my problem. I roll up here in the middle of the goddamn night to deliver 20 cases of champagne. Oh, God, um... I... I'm sorry, you're right I'm such a fuzz brain, I just... um, it's next week. Could l... could I just pull up and turn around? Right. I'm sorry. Thanks. I love you. Care to join us? You get dressed, and get the fuck outta here. Hey, man, she's coming with me. Okay. I mean, sure. Angel, do you want Roland to pack your things or... I'm staying here. I want you to go. Just go. Hey. Hey, we're meant to be together. Oh, dear. Now you're talking in song titles. Nate, you're a man of the world. Not my world. But you look as if... you've lived a life. So you understand that everything changes. Everything ends. Not this. Don't help me. Don't do anything. I don't want to be with you, Nate. Please don't do this. I want you to leave. Stay for the movie, I don't care. As long as I'm with you nothing happens to him. And that's our deal. I promise. You break it, I'm gone. You can't bus tables. You can't clean toilets. You can't even buy a drink in here. Not here, nor anywheres else. My man. Hey. Mad Malcolm. Goddamn. I'm liking the look. Well, you know. Well, you know me. Footloose. Ow. And fancy free. Like seeing a ghost, son. Word on the street is, uh Happy ain't too happy with you these days. Yeah, well, uh... I'm still breathing. Amen to that, brother. I bet you could use a gig, though. Oh, man, I could use a lot of things. I'm playing with some fellas at this thing. It's a party, you dig? Over at the museum. You show up... play a couple of tunes they pay you like a rock star. Oh, museum? Come on, man, that ain't my thing. Yeah? A hundred dollars a night sound like your thing? Hey. Get some socks, don't get your feet cold. All right, baby, let me know. Yeah, about... Hm. I'm gonna be a little short to the gig... Think you could, uh, let me hold twenty? That is, you owe the pawn shop twenty, right? Yeah. That's a pretty fat roll you got there. You think maybe, uh you know, give a little to the hat? Huh? Now don't let me see you on the street. You've always been there for me. Skate! Beautiful. Thank you. Mind if I stay? You can do whatever you want. I'll stay. Okay. My real name isn't Happy. Michael. My real name is Michael. Mike. When I was a kid, apparently I walked around with a big frown I was a very pissed-off little guy. Not that there was much to smile about. My dad named me Happy. That was his joke. I hated it. I hated him. But it stuck. You know, you can't keep a good nickname down. I always hated it. Until now. Why is that? Because it fits finally. I am happy. Happy, no. Diamonds, the angel's stone. Well, if it's not, it should be. I can't take this. Keep it. Some day you're gonna be happy. Happy, where are we? Heaven. Happy Shannon! Man of the hour. Thank you, Anne. Nice of you to say, but I really think it's the city's hour don't you? But it was your generosity that made this heavenly show possible. Well, it's for the young people and, uh, I had inspiration. Is this a new Happy Shannon? Angels, heaven? Yes, it is. Yes, it is, um... Is there ever been a moment where you felt that you weren't getting a... a... Let me ask you about your two federal indictments. Conspiracy, tampering with evidence. No, no. Come on Sweetie. Let's warm you up. Now, wait, baby, no, no. Shh. Shh. Shh. Yeah. Last thing on earth you'll ever see. Wings. I'll send Lily your regards. Good to see you, Nate. I'll send Lily your regards. I'll send Lily your regards. My Lily. The last thing on earth you'll ever see... Wake up, Nate! Wake up, Nate! Get up! Wake up! Wake up, Nate! Get up, goddamn it! Get up! Good. Cold, isn't it? Stupid motherfucker. Lily. Nate. Nate! Close. Come on, get your things we're going home. Don't touch me. We're what? I found her. I raised her. Happy! "We're leaving." I think that's what he was trying to say. He's right. Come on, come on. Why? Why? Because... You're not happy anymore. It's open. It's a fucking hurricane out there. Yeah. Whatever. Yeah. You look like shit. Got a smoke? You remember my cousin Marvin, the cop? Yeah. The one who works down in Newport Division. Told me that there's gonna be a raid in a couple hours. Around five. Busting a black and tan joint down on Adams. So? Well, I'll tell you so a lot of stars, hookers, dope, you know, whatever Marvin says that there's a private club upstairs. Guess whose club it is. Come on, Ricky. Happy's club. Oh. You know what they do in there? Dope? Nope. Cards? Nope. Pussy. What the fuck, I don't know. They watch some freak in a glass box. Can you believe that shit? These stiffs are paying Happy a fortune, to watch some naked humpback bitch. I'm not kidding you. I mean, fuck! I'm in the wrong line of work. Caught you, you bad boy. What are you doing here? Oh, I'm a party gal looking for a good time. Ricky filled me in. Mm-hm. Nate, why are you doing this? I have got to meet this girl. Don't you all worry about this bubbly shit, I got the good stuff right here. Oh, hello. Have a drink, sweetheart. Here we go! We're gonna go inside and have a good night tonight, huh? Oh, yeah, yeah. Here you go, brother. - Hey, Dan. - Thank you, Dan. Please come in. Please come in. Check your coat? Uh... Thank you. Beautiful, isn't she? Nate, what are we gonna do? You're gonna fly. What? You can do it. I can't fly, Nate. Nate, I can't fly! The wind is blowing just right, you can fly. You can do this, come on. Nate, it's not gonna work, it's not gonna work. Oh, baby. What? I love you. Get over here. You'll fall like a brick. I love you. Nate! No!
