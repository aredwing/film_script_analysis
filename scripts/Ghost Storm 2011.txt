We're having fun. You call this fun? Welcome to small island living. Get used to it, because you are stuck here. Only until we graduate. [THUNDER CRASHING] Can we go now? The storm is getting worse. No, that's the point. It's automatic. Every time there's an electrical storm in the area, lightning strikes this graveyard. It's freaky. Freaky romantic? Heh, heh. Come here. [GIRLS SCREAM] ROB: Ho-ho! There it is. Oh... Oh, that's it. I'm out of here. Me too. Cracked the old memorial. Creepy. That's messed up. What's the old memorial? Sabbath day suicide? Our urban legends don't make it to the big city? Lucky if your mail makes it to the mainland. Hey, it's not a legend, you buffoon. Well? ROB: Well, years ago, there was an old priest who got a bunch of crazies together who burned themselves to death in some, like, ritual. Like the Jonestown cult. Yes. Can we go now? Yeah, yeah. First I gotta take a leak. Heh. Don't watch, ladies. Heh. [ZIPPER ZIPS] [INDISTINCT WHISPERING] [EXHALES] [WHISTLES] [INDISTINCT OVERLAPPING VOICES] [GRUNTS] [GROANS] # Straight # # Is it finding them? ## [MELISSA MOANING] [STATIC CRACKLING OVER EARPHONES] Aah! Aah! What happened, Daisy? What's going on? I just saw something on my screen. Will? Will? Daisy's freaking out. We gotta go. DAISY: I'm calling him now. This better not be another joke! Where are you, Will? Will. All right, come on. [CELL PHONE RINGING] [GASPS] [BOTH SCREAMING] MAN: All right, Father, give it a try. And the Lord said, "Let there be light. " And there was light. Oh. And he saw that the light was good. Well, I don't know how good the light is. Well, I'm just glad that they're working again. Heh. You know, you're truly a jack-of-all-trades. Ha-ha-ha. Unfortunately my ex-wife would tell you I'm a jack of a different kind. [CELL PHONE RINGS] Excuse me. Hello? Daisy, what's going...? All right, calm down. Calm... Calm down. Where are you? All right, look, I want you to stay there. I'm on my way, okay? Stay there. Bye. MAN: And that's the last of it. We bid adieu to you, Mr. Thunderstorm. Thanks for the memories. Really? What? It was an attempt at humor. Sadly, you're not gonna have another attempt like that for at least another week. Yeah, I know. That high-pressure system's gonna keep things pretty boring around here. [CELL PHONE RINGS] Hal? Yeah, it's me. Something's up with Daisy. What happened? I don't know. She called me in a panic. She's at the cemetery. What's she doing there? How should I know? Not my night, it's yours. You're gonna start with me now? I'm headed over there to pick her up now. Why don't you meet us at the house? All right. You okay? Yeah, I'm fine. Um... Just get the weather update to the mainland station. Thanks, Brett. [CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKING] Tell me something. Does that look like the corpse of a 17-year-old boy to you? More like 200. Are you sure this is Will? That's what they said. [THUNDER RUMBLING] Why, you think they exhumed a body? Kids and their pranks. We were all 17 once, no? I don't know, Doug. Look at their faces. I don't think it's a prank. Let's get it over to the morgue, see if we can get a positive ID, huh? [SOBS AND SNIFFLES] Sweetie. Are you okay? Will's dead. What? Honey, why don't you go inside and lie down, huh? [SIGHS] [WHISPERS] What happened? We don't know what happened yet. We said she wasn't gonna hang out with that kid. [IN NORMAL VOICE] No, you said that. She's 17, not 7. That's not what I meant. Look, I said the wrong thing. I'm sorry. Look, it's cold out here. I'm gonna go see how she's doing. All right. Wait, I, um... I made you a sandwich. You made me a sandwich? I figured you'd have a late night. And I know how you get when you eat that junk out of the vending machine. You still like me. Hey, don't push it. [THUNDER RUMBLING] [SOBBING] [CELL PHONE RINGING] Will? WILL: Daisy. Will? Help me. [MAN SCREAMS THEN STATIC CRACKLING OVER PHONE] [MAN LAUGHING IN DEEP VOICE OVER PHONE] Will! [SCREAMS] The rate of decomposition is absolutely staggering. What could cause this? The kids said lightning struck the area. You think he was struck by lightning? It could answer part of it. But there's gotta be more, a lot more. The sheer tissue deterioration. His internal organs are drained of all fluids. [SIGHS] You've been doing this a long time, doc. You ever seen anything like this before? No. Never. I'm out of my league here. I don't have the tools for this kind of analysis. I want to send this body off to a lab in Seattle. Hal, Will's father is here to see you. He seems pretty upset. Yeah, I'm sure he is. Carl? I'm sorry for your loss. What happened? We don't know what happened yet. My boy's dead. I know he is. Look, it could've just as easily been my own daughter. I wanna know just as badly as you do, and when I find out, you'll be the first person I call, I promise. I want to see him. It's not a good idea. I want to see him. The body is in bad shape. I wanna see my son. Okay, come on. [DOOR OPENS] What? What the hell is this? Where's my boy? Doc. What's going on? I haven't left the room. Stop lying to me. We're the only two people that have been in this room. I was looking at your boy a minute ago. This is some kind of sick joke. [SIGHING] Just so's you know, I'm packing heat and I came first in my shooting class. [INDISTINCT WHISPERING] Hello? [WHIMPERING] [INDISTINCT OVERLAPPING VOICES] Hal, come in. Something strange is happening at the cemetery. Mary, it's Hal. What's going on? [WHIMPERING] HAL [OVER RADIO]: Mary. [SIREN WAILING] [HORN HONKING] Aah... Mary, do you read me? Aah! [SCREAMS] ASHLEY: That's a mistake. It can't be. How big of a drop? We're at about 870 millibars. I'd say that's impossible. We'd have a hurricane. Yeah, but we don't have a hurricane, and yet... [TYPING ON KEYBOARD] Wait for it. [BEEPING] What's that cell over? [SIGHS] [BEEPING] That's the cemetery. That's where the kids were last night. What's it at now? Oh. It's still way too low. Check the equipment. Gotta be a malfunction. Well, where you going? Cemetery. [SIREN WAILING] Oh, my God. Doug, take a look at this. That can't be her, can it? What the hell is going on around here? What do you mean, he called you? I'm telling you. My phone rang and when I looked at it, it was Will's number. Except I have Will's phone. And then when I answered it, it was just static. ROB: I just can't believe this. Look, we all saw the lightning strike the memorial. Something supernatural is going on in that cemetery. What, you think it's a curse from the Sabbath suicide victims? I bet Father Telmo knows something. He knows the history better than anyone. We should ask him. Beats sitting around talking about it. Meliss? Me? Uh, no way. I got enough bad juju to last a year. But let me know how it goes, okay? Okay. Bye, sweetie. Bye. [INDISTINCT WHISPERING] Hey. Did you hear that? No. Doug. Did you see that? DOUG: No. [CAR APPROACHING] Great, just what I need. What are you doing here? Nice to see you too. No, I have a crime scene. I can't let you go any further. I brought my equipment to take a reading. HAL: No, not today. What the hell? [INDISTINCT WHISPERING] [GRUNTING] [DOUG SCREAMS] Doug! Doug! [BOTH GASPING] [RUMBLING] [OVERLAPPING VOICES SCREAM] ROB: Father Telmo? Somebody should be here, no? Maybe he's in the back office. Maybe he's doing an exorcism. Not funny. [SIREN WAILING] Carl. You see this thing? What the hell is it? ASHLEY: We don't know what it is. It came from the graveyard. The what? Cells are all down. I need your phone. Use someone else's. I'm not asking, Carl. It's an emergency. Father? Hello? Doesn't look like he's here. Yeah. What's up? [SCREAMS] Do you know that guy or something? Daisy? That guy was on my phone last night. What? What do you mean...? What are you doing? Are you gonna steal from a church now? I'm investigating. No. No, tomorrow doesn't work. Hey, this is an emergency. We have three fatalities here. I need help now. [SCOFFS] You have got to be kidding me. All right, look, just make sure they get here by morning. They're not sending anyone? Bureaucratic garbage. They can't get a team here until the morning. [WIND WHISTLING] Hal, you better come see this. [CAR HORNS HONKING] What the hell are they doing? [SIRENS WAIL] [PEOPLE CHATTERING] Hey, everybody, listen up. You cannot be here. It's not safe. Authorities will help figure out what's going on. Until then, you cannot be here. This area is off limits, so go home. Come on. I'll launch my weather balloon into that cloud. What? Are you crazy? After what we just saw? No way. Until we figure out what's going on, I won't let anybody in, including you. What we're seeing defies explanation. My point exactly. That's why I won't let you in there. If my instruments can pick it up, we can figure out what it is. Three people have died within a day. We don't have till tomorrow. You're right. Wow. If you'd said that more often, we might still be together. Let's not get carried away. [THUNDER RUMBLING] What is that? A radiosonde. Measures atmospheric parameters. It'll tell us everything we need to know about this storm's physical properties. Okay, you can let it go. [BEEPING] It's working. [COMPUTER BEEPING RAPIDLY] What's happening? I don't know. [STATIC CRACKLING] What's that? Did you see that? Ashley, watch out. Aah! All right, that's it, we're out of here. [THUNDER RUMBLING] That was fun. I think I have what I need. That doesn't look good. Sure the data is usable? These things are made to take a beating. Great. Let me know what you find out. Wait. Where will you be? Here. Are you crazy? We don't know what we're dealing with. Yeah, I know, but I can't risk somebody else getting killed. Post a sign then. Put your family first. What kind of father would I be if I let somebody get killed while I'm busy protecting my own skin? Just go, please. I'll be fine, all right? Okay. Be careful. All right. Sweetie, I need that computer. Do you know who this is? Where did you find that? At the church. Do you know who this is? That's, um... Father Barrett... your great-grandfather. My great-grandfather? Suicide-massacre Father Barrett? Now's not the time. Why don't we wait another 17 years? He was not a good man, Daisy. He did unthinkable things. It's not something that I'm proud of. I just think it's something you might have mentioned. You're right. And I'm sorry. Now, please, I need to get in there. WOMAN [ON TV]: You're tuned to Channel 9. Coming up, gardening experts share their tips. You'll get the latest information to grow the best vegetables in... MAN 1: At the current rates of expansion, projections... MAN 2: The sun is going to be making an effort to peek through... [STATIC CRACKLING ON TV] WILL: Dad, help me. Help me. Help me. Dad. Help me. Help me. Dad, help me. [SCREAMS] [STATIC CRACKLING OVER RADIO] Come on. Come on. Damn it. This is so strange. Humidity's way too low. Too low to create water vapor. And it's heating up, not cooling. That storm can't physically exist. I'll tell you what doesn't make sense. I saw my great-grandfather's face on my phone last night when the memorial was struck by lightning. I saw a ghost, Mom. I think he's the one that's making all of this happen. [STATIC CRACKLING OVER RADIO] What the hell? [TIRES SCREECHING] Okay, Brett, I'm gonna upload the data so you can see exactly... Hello? Brett? [DOGS BARKING] [SCREAMING] WOMAN: Those are Ben's shoes. MAN: Oh, that doesn't look good. CLAIRE: I don't understand. [SIREN WAILS] [CROWD MURMURING] Hal, something happened to Ben. I mean... Good God. It's the devil's work. All right, Claire, I'll take care of this. I saw it. MAN: Huh? Thomas? It took ahold of him like a rag doll. Took hold of him? It zapped him, Hal. Like a death ray. All right, all right. What exactly did you see? I saw the wrath of Satan. It come down the street. It took his soul. Calm down. There's a logical explanation to all of this. There is a logical explanation. Military testing. Military testing. It's always military testing. All right, that's enough. Thank you. I need you to clear out. Go home. Tell your friends it's not safe to be outside. Please, go. I saw it, Hal. You got the genny working. It sort of kicked on by itself but I'll take the credit. What happened? These things aren't cheap. I know. I hope the data isn't corrupted. What do you want me to do? Build a computer model so we can see where the storm is drawing energy. Yeah, okay. Well, where you going? Hal really needs my help. Okay. Thanks. [GRUNTS] [STATIC CRACKLING AND BEEPING] Hal, people are gathering in the streets. Sheriff Hal Miller transmitting on the state emergency channel. Do you read me? [CHATTERING] MAN [OVER RADIO]: I read you, Hal. Where's my help? They're on the ferry. They'll be there soon. All right, thank you. Out. CARL: Hal! Hal, get out here. WOMAN: Get out here. MAN 1: Sheriff? Sheriff? MAN 2: Come on, we need to know. What's going on here, folks? Carl, what is this? We want the truth, Hal. Yeah. We have a right to know. CARL: Something you're not telling us. HAL: Look, we have no idea what's going on, but state investigators are on a ferry coming here right now. Until they get here, you all take shelter. Shelter? Shelter from what? There's a dangerous atmospheric phenomenon happening on the island. She's right about the phenomenon but it's not atmospheric. No? Well, then what is it? Supernatural. [CROWD CLAMORING] I need everybody to stay calm and show no fear. That's the first rule. Fear empowers evil spirits. It makes them stronger. I'm sorry, who are you? Greg Goropolis, paranormal investigator. I'm here to help. Well, Mr. Goropolis, I don't know what dinghy you just jumped off of, but the last thing we need is an outsider scaring... This island is exploding with PKE. You should be scared. PKE? Psychokinetic energy. Dark energy, spiritual energy. Has it taken a life yet? Yeah, we've... We've lost several in the last 24 hours. I need to see the victims. We don't have victims. We have ashes. We don't have a lot of time then, do we? Who here has suffered the biggest loss so far? My boy, Will. Has he tried to contact you? Excuse me? Contact. Light bulbs popping, strange phone calls with static. I don't know. Maybe there was something on my TV last night. Damn near scared me half to death. We'll start there. Hold on, hold on. I'm not letting you start anywhere. Why not? Because these people are afraid. They've lost loved ones. And I don't need you scaring them with your talk of garlic and holy water. So you're just gonna sit around and wait for that help of yours to show up? Yeah, that's right. And what if they don't? Why are you here anyways? I really can't control it. I just go where I'm called. Look, sheriff, I wanna help these people, same as you. Give me a chance. Tell you what, your help arrives, I disappear. All right, Mr. Goropolis, give it a shot. Thank you, sheriff. ROB: You lost me in the "unfinished business" part. If spirits feel like they've been wronged in this world, they resolve it before passing on to the next. So? So if this is about the suicide victims, then maybe something in the church archives will help us figure how to stop it. Where the heck did you hear that from? The Internet. So, what is all this stuff? It's looking for speech patterns in the storm's electromagnetic waves. White-noise generator. Opens a window, allows those on the other side to appear. It's just a lot of dime-store electronics. Costs a lot more than a few dimes but you got the "electronics" part right. It's basically what a spirit is. It's an electronic impulse. You guys just have a rather large one. What you're saying is that we have a storm of spirits? Evil spirits trapped in this world. The angry souls are the dark energy, the yin of the storm, so to speak. But there has to be a yang, a light soul, a pure soul that they're clinging to. [STATIC CRACKLING OVER COMPUTER] [MAN WHISPERING INDISTINCTLY] [SCREECH] What is that? Over there. In the car. Hello? Can you hear us? [STATIC CRACKLING AND WAVERING OVER RADIO] We're here to help you. Who am I speaking to? WILL: Will. CARL: Will? Will? Son, is that you? It's Will, Dad. Dad. Dad. Help me, Dad. Help me. Dad? Will. Dad? [SCREAMS] [STATIC CRACKLING] HAL: I don't believe this. All right, how do we stop these things? In 1996, there was a PKE outbreak on a farm in Washington County. We loaded a crop duster with saltwater and it dispersed the entity. [SIREN WAILING] GREG: I know it sounds crazy, but saltwater absorbs the dark energy of spirits. MAN 1: All right, guys, let's move. MAN 2: Get those hoses in position. MAN 3: Come on. Start the pumps. MAN 4: I got it. MAN 3: Start the pumps. [INDISTINCT WHISPERING] MAN 4: Anytime. No, no, no. Not yet. Let it get closer. Not yet. Wait, wait. Not yet, not yet. Now! Hit it now! [GRUNTING] Look out! [SCREAMS] Oh, my God. GREG: Come on, let's go! Go, go, go. [SIREN WAILING] What the hell just happened back there? That salt only made it worse. I don't know. Salt usually works. The ferry's coming. Finally, a little help. That's not the kind of help we need. [FERRY HORN BLARING] WOMAN: Hurry up. MAN 1: Let's go, let's go. [ALL CLAMORING] MAN 2: Come on, let's go, let's go. [SIREN WAILING] MAN 3: I got it. [PEOPLE SCREAMING] Oh, my God. [GASPS] Oh, my God. WOMAN 2: Here, take it. MAN 3: I got it. Give me that. MAN 4: Let's get out of here. WOMAN 3: Get out of here. Get inside. WOMAN 4: Look out! [PEOPLE CLAMORING] MAN 5: Get in the boat. Get in the boat. [INDISTINCT WHISPERING] Hey! Hey! Sheriff? Sheriff? Sheriff? Sheriff! Go! We gotta go! Sheriff! Get in the car. We gotta go. Sheriff, come on. Move, move. Get in the car. ASHLEY: Let's go. Hurry! GREG: Drive. Drive, sheriff, drive. ASHLEY: Come on. GREG: Go, go, go. Go! [SIREN WAILING] These things go back ages. Did you ever hear about a missing altar boy during the time of the mass suicide? Before now? No. Why? I don't know. It's odd. There's not an agency in the world that'll help. You gotta evacuate. How? You saw what it did to the marina. That's the only way out of here. It's bigger than anything I've seen. Well, there's gotta be something we can do to stop it. There's a light in that storm. As thin as it is, I know it's there. I just gotta find it. What? Nothing. It started in the cemetery, right? Yeah. The memorial for the mass suicide. Stop the car. HAL: What? Stop the car. Where you going? Cemetery. You wanna solve a problem, you start where it started. Hey, be careful. Hey. Hey, check this out. Come here. What is that? Looks like a journal, written by Father Telmo in 1912? Telmo senior? I guess so. "May 13th, 1912. With Father Barrette's break from the holy covenant, I have been appointed to assume duties as the religious leader of the parish. " Uh... "It's with deepest regret that I must record the following events as a true account. " I don't understand this. This isn't what everyone thinks happened. So, what does this mean? I don't know, but I gotta show this to my dad. Mom! Dad! Daisy. Thank God you're okay. HAL: Daisy, where you been? I found this journal. It's not safe outside. We gotta get you home. This was Father Telmo's. We don't have time. ASHLEY: More people have been hurt. Hurt? You mean killed. Yes, killed, yes. You need to read this. Enough. You're going home, right now. Go. Mayday, mayday, mayday. Does anyone copy? [STATIC CRACKLING OVER RADIO] Are there any vessels receiving me? [STATIC WAVERING OVER RADIO] [THUNDER RUMBLING] [SIREN BLARING] MAN: Run, run, run! [INDISTINCT WHISPERING] [ALL CLAMORING] Hey. MELISSA: Rob. MAN: What's going on? The storm's coming. We have to get off the island. Impossible. It just took out the marina. Okay, I want you to go inside, lock all the doors and close the windows. What are you gonna do? Nobody's coming to help us. Your dad's alone, I gotta go help him. Everything's gonna be all right. I love you, Mom. I love you too. MAN 1: Oh, my God! [ALL CLAMORING] MAN 2: Wait for me! WOMAN: Oh, no. Mom. [THUNDER RUMBLING] [GASPING] [HORN HONKING] [MAN 1 SHOUTING] MAN 2: This way. Help. Help! Help! [SCREAMING] HAL: Go inside. There's no getting off the island. Close your windows, lock your doors. [INDISTINCT WHISPERING] MAN: Daisy. [SCREAMING] What is happening? [CROWD CLAMORING] Everybody listen up. I need you to lock this place down and stay put. Seal up all the doors, windows, vents. Every crack, all right? And stay in here. Sheriff. Where's Daisy? She's with her mother. Listen, Rob, make sure they seal this place up good. All right, you heard the man. Let's seal this place up, now. Let's go. [INDISTINCT WHISPERING] [CELL PHONE RINGING] [GASPING] [RINGING] WILL [OVER PHONE]: Daisy. [LAUGHING] [SCREAMS] [SCREAMS] [INDISTINCT WHISPERING] [WHIMPERING] Open your door! Come on, open your door! It's Thomas. No, don't open it. We can't just leave him out there. What are you doing? Get off me! What are you doing? Get off me! Thomas! Quick, open the door! [THOMAS SCREAMS] ASHLEY: Get in. HAL: Go. Where's Daisy? She's okay. She's safe at the house. We need to get off these streets. [PEOPLE CLAMORING AND YELLING] [GASPS] Back it up. Back it up. Stop the car. Stop the car! Get out! Get out! Come on! Get out! Let's go. In the church, quick. Hey! Open up! Open up! ASHLEY: Hurry! Come on! Hurry! Open up! Open up! Seal the cracks. Grab whatever you can. Seal it up. Mom! Hello? Mom! [GENERATOR WHIRRING] Brett, have you seen my mom? She's not here. Daisy! Oh! Daisy! Come on. [TIRES SCREECHING] [THUNDER CRASHING AND RUMBLING] WOMAN: This window needs sealing. MAN 1: Just shove that there. Shove that there. MAN 2: I got it, I got it. I got it. We don't have all day. Why's it just hovering out there? I wish I knew. I gotta get back to the station. There's gotta be some scientific solution to this thing. What happened to the help? The storm took out the ferries coming in. We're on our own. And where the hell is Father Telmo? O holy church, I venerate thee as our guardian and protector. He's the one that should know what this spirit wants, right? Or maybe you know, Ashley. To forgive the sins of our fathers, and crush the evil souls at our doorstep. It's your grandfather's face we keep seeing. I don't know any more than you do, Carl. [CRACKLING] [RUMBLING] Almighty Lord, vanquish these evil souls, so that they may no longer retain us captive and do harm. Why is it striking the yard? There's gotta be something under there. Or maybe there's something in here it wants. We need to seal these windows. Do you have any tape? Uh... Tape. Yeah, here. Okay. MAN: Then over here. [PEOPLE CHATTERING] [CELL PHONE RINGING] Is your phone working? [GASPING] Oh, my God. It's you. It wants you. HAL: Don't answer it. [CELL PHONE RINGING] Don't answer your phone. Don't answer it. Don't! [PEOPLE SCREAMING] [PEOPLE CLAMORING] [CELL PHONES RINGING] Don't answer them. No one answer your phone. The evil spirit surrounding this church is Father Barrett, her grandfather. He led all those people to their death, and now it's back. It wants more. This is no time to start pointing fingers, Carl. Whatever it is, it's not gonna stop until it gets what it wants. We don't know what it wants. We are all gonna die if we don't do something. She is part of the damn bloodline. What are you talking about? That's insanity, Carl. No! This is our one chance to save ourselves. It wants her. All right, that's enough. Come on, we're getting out of here. No. ASHLEY: What are you doing? Let go of her! ASHLEY: Let go of me. Let go of me! MAN: Stop him. Let go of me! Get off of me! CARL: Stop fighting! Let go of me! CARL: Calm down! [GUNSHOTS] [PEOPLE SCREAM] Let go of her. [COCKS GUN] Now. I know you're all scared. We are too. But that's no reason to start sacrificing each other. Now, we're gonna walk out of here, and anybody who follows us, I'm gonna shoot. All right? [MAN GRUNTS] ASHLEY: No! HAL: Go! Go! [COMPUTER BEEPING] [STATIC CRACKLING] CARL: This way, come on. In here, quick. Get back. Hal! [MOUTHS] He's out of bullets. How do you know? He only had four rounds left. I think they're gone. What's happening? I don't know. I don't know. I'm so sorry. What? I'm so sorry for what's happened to us. It wasn't your fault. Things weren't that bad, were they? Compared to this, it was a picnic. [CHUCKLES] Isn't this what Daisy gave you? Yeah. Written by Telmo's father? Look, she bookmarked it. Wait. "May 16th, 1912. Father help me, for I know not what to do. With each passing day, my guilt consumes my every hour. There's no penance that can absolve me of this darkest sin. " Oh, my God. There was no mass suicide. These people were killed. [SIGNAL WAVERING ON RADIO] I can't get anything. [SCREAMS] Follow me. WOMAN: No! [ALL SCREAMING] I'm so scared, Rob. I don't wanna die. It's okay, baby. It's okay. It's okay. [GASPS] Brett! [BEEPING] Brett! Something's happening out here. [SCREAMING] [BANGING ON DOOR] Where the hell are they? Search the church. Hurry. MAN 1: All right, let's go. MAN 2: Spread out. [WHISPERS] All right, come on. Telmo. [SCREAMS] What is that? It's blood. Kiss me. Oh, baby. [GROANS] No! Oh, God. [SCREAMS] [TELMO PRAYING INDISTINCTLY] TELMO: I will release from my sins... Father? What are you doing? Trying to save our souls. Praying? It's the only weapon we have. Daisy found your father's journal. I should have burned that diary. I don't understand. Why keep the truth a secret all these years? To protect the town. To protect the town, or to protect your family's reputation? Your father led the lynch mob that killed those people. He was trying to save the life of an innocent child. Barrett and his followers were going to sacrifice a young altar boy. It was your father who killed the altar boy. You don't know what you're talking about! This is my... HAL: Father. Father. Father! HAL: Father, answer me! Phil! Bruce! [INDISTINCT WHISPERING] [GROWLS] [SCREAMS] SPIRIT: Daisy! [SHRIEKS THEN PANTING] [FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING] I was wrong. It's not Ash the storm wants. It's him. All right. Calm down, Carl. A while ago, you said it wants Ashley. Now it's Father Telmo. That's before I read what's in here. Your father murdered the cult and the altar boy. That's why the ghosts are circling the church. They want you. You have to atone for the sins of your father. All right. We need to band together, not turn on each other. This storm is tearing this island apart. I'm taking him. ASHLEY: Wait! Stop! [ALL GRUNTING] No! Enough! I will go. Don't do it, Father. You're gonna thank me when this is over. ASHLEY: Are you okay? Yeah. Look... You need to go get Daisy, all right? What about you? I'm gonna go try to save Father Telmo. Go. Go! [PEOPLE MURMURING] Stop! It won't work. How do you know, Hal? Besides, the priest is the only hand we have to play. Isn't that right, Father? He may be right. I may be able to stop this. It's suicide. I have to try. [ELECTRICITY BUZZING] [SCREAMS] [PEOPLE CLAMORING] Come on, everybody out of here! Out! Everybody out, come on! [ALL SCREAMING] WILL: Dad. Will? It's me. Hey. [DEEP VOICE SPEAKS INDISTINCTLY] WOMAN: Go, go, go. Go, go, go. Let's go. [GRUNTING] [PANTING] [INDISTINCT WHISPERING] [SCREAMS] [PANTING] [WHISPERS] All right, listen up. I want you to seal this up. Whatever you do, don't go outside. All right? Okay. Seal that up. Daisy? Daisy! Daisy! DAISY: Mom! Daisy. So happy to see you. Thank God you're okay. It's coming through the bottom of the door! It repels the mist. Okay. We need to seal up the door. I got it. Go. I thought you were dead. Me too. I found this. Saved my life. What is it? It's a talisman. A what? A talisman. It's a ritual object. It's what kept the souls trapped in that tomb. Can it stop this? The storm isn't one entity. It's multiple souls. Not all of them are evil. Some of them are trapped. Some are confused. I'm just looking for a way to stop this. I know. That's my point. There's a pure soul trapped in the storm, an innocent. The altar boy. What? Look, I found out a few things too. That memorial, it wasn't a suicide. It was a massacre. There was a cult led by this priest, Father Barrett. They were gonna sacrifice a young altar boy. The rest of the town tried to stop him. It became violent. The boy got caught in the crossfire, was killed. That's the pure soul. The altar boy. Yeah, if we can identify the frequency of the pure soul, if we can amplify it, it'll weaken the storm. We can trap it again with the talisman. Amplify. Would...? A weather balloon, would that work? A radiosonde, sure. Okay, that I can help you with. This thing run? Battery's dead. Great. What about that, uh, talisman thing? Is that gonna protect us out there? I have no idea. I guess we'll find out. Come on. We gotta get going. Let's go. [GRUNTING AND GROANING] I can't. Yes, you can. I can't. Just keep moving. I can't. Go. Just go. No. I can't. [GROANING] You gotta go on. You gotta leave me. No. You're gonna be all right. If we both die, everybody dies. [THUNDER RUMBLING] You have a wife and a little girl. Get up. Come on. What are you doing? Find the light in the darkness. [OVERLAPPING VOICES SCREAMING] [INDISTINCT WHISPERING] [DOORKNOB RATTLING] It's gonna get in. [GRUNTS] DAISY: Oh, my God. Dad, are you okay? Hal. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. You guys are all right. What are you doing with that thing? I don't know. It repels it. Let me see it. It's class C. It's used to put out electrical fires. That means it's not immune to the laws of physics. That's right. We can kill it. Okay. What is that? That is our other weapon. And this is gonna protect us? That is the only reason I'm still alive. Even if this works, this data still could be destroyed. HAL: Well, if that's the case, then we all need to start saying a prayer. That's our only shot at finding the frequency. You mean the altar boy. That's right. [STATIC CRACKLING] Okay. I'm getting something. Is the data still there? Yeah, the data seems to be here. Thank you, Brett. Okay. So I've stripped everything except the electrical signatures. I don't see it. Hold on, I'm not done. Okay. So far, the frequency seems to be pretty consistent, 300 megahertz. [BEEPING] What's that right there? That's only 80. That's gotta be it. Son of a gun. Greg was right. Okay, so now what? Well, now we have to get in there and amplify that frequency. How are we gonna do that? Use the weather balloon. We tried that. It lasted two seconds. Trojan horse. Huh? Trojan horse. We send up the balloon transmitting the same frequency as the spirits. They'll think it's one of their own. And then once it's in, we can switch it to 80 and then amplify the signal. Exactly. Theory being that it weakens the spirits and gives us a chance to trap them. When did you come up with that? Just now. I mean, the Trojan horse part. Trap them? Well, look, I'm kind of winging it here, but think about it. Where do those spirits come from? The ground. What kept them in the ground? The talisman. Well, we have the talisman. All we need to do is get the spirits back in the ground. Daisy, I need you to put together a wire. A long wire. Uh, make it out of cable, whatever you can find. What is this for? The spirits are electrical. So we can ground them with the wire. Exactly. Okay, I'm ready. Dad, will this work? Oh, that's great, Daisy. That's great. All right, so attach one end to the radiosonde and this end to the tower. And then... Hope that it works better than salt and water. Don't change the frequency till I tell you to. Wait. I still love you. I love you too. Hey, come here. I'm proud of you. I love you, Daddy. All right. I'll be back. You better be. Mom? Oh, my God. Change the frequency! Change the frequency! [GRUNTS] [THUNDER CRASHING] Oh, come on. Come on. [GRUNTS] I got it. Great. Oh, my God. DAISY: Oh... What is that? Mom! ASHLEY: Oh, my God. DAISY: It's gone. [SPIRIT GRUNTING] [TYPING ON KEYBOARD] DAISY: Mom, you got it? Go to hell. [SPIRIT SHRIEKS] Hal! [GRUNTING] [OVERLAPPING VOICES SCREAMING] [GROANING] [BOTH GASP] Oh, dear God. Hal! Dad! Don't you leave me. [COUGHING] Does this mean you want me back? Mm-hm. Really? You're grounded. Do you think it's over? Yeah, I do. Can we go home now? I don't know. Can we? Well, I got a bunch of paperwork to do back at the office. Dad. Yeah, let's go home.
