Was that fun, scaring me? Do you want some cake? Thank you. Wee. She doesn't want you to get fat. He got diabetes. Come on, just a little. A little bit only. Lucky. You are beginning to understand others. but not about yourself. Your lost things. will be found... Was there something you lost.. .. A long time ago? No. Maybe... It's not a thing, but maybe just someone. And there will be a cost. Hey, her predictions can't be trusted. Before I was told I'll have a partner soon, but so far, I am still single. The interpretation is imprecise. You are lovely Khan. If I was so lovely I could get boy as good looking as Wee. Just a moment. Are you still scared of injections? Yes. All done. I'll tide this up first. Hello. Just a minute. Pim... Telephone. Pim. She's Busy, can I help? Where are you right now? Pardon? What is it? Pim. The hospital in Thailand called, to say your mother is sick. Shall we go back? If I hadn't come here, maybe it wouldn't have happened. What is up Pim? I don't want to go back there.. Since Ploy died. I don't want to live in that house anymore. Do yo think I'm selfish? Not at all! If I hadn't wanted the operation, maybe Ploy wouldn't have died. Pim, it was the operation. it wasn't your fault! No one plans to be born that way. The patient can't get up today. and she can't speak. This type of brain injury causes this type of effect. So we have to wait for it to heal a little. before we can be sure of the outcome. Mother. Mother. She is healing now. and maybe tomorrow she will be better. We can visit again then. Oh Pim! This was Ploy's favourite song. Ploy. Madam. I have finished everything, Can I go home now? You don't stay here? No Madam. Well, you can stay here? It will be less trouble for you. Never mind Madam. It's better that I go home. Wee... Wee! What is up? Wee. What is it? What is it? Mother. What happened mom? What is it? What mom? Apologies madam, I just need to give an injection. Noi. What exactly happened to my mom? Why is she so sick? I really don't know madam. Since you came to work here, how has my mom been? Noi. Well... I didn't know what was wrong. She just kept herself in the room, Crying. Sometimes I felt that, she was scared of something. Scared of what? Doctor, how's my mother? Now she's stable. But she had a relapse. Miss... Miss? Is something wrong, Miss? Pim. Are you tired? You can go home if you want. I'll wait here. Never mind Wee. The patient is very sick, but I can't say how bad. When she will feel better? I can't answer that yet. because it depends on her will to survive. Lucky. Lucky. Lucky. Lucky. Lucky. Lucky. Lucky. Lucky. Lucky. What is it? Pim! Pim! Open the door! Pim! Pim, what happened? what happened? Finished. Pim. What is it? Why did you wound yourself? Pim. What is the problem? I keep seeing my twin. What do you mean? I feel she is around me all the time... I don't understand. How could you see her? Ploy is dead already. It's her! I think about it too much. Pim. Maybe you should see a doctor? Wee. I'm not crazy. How are you? Ok, Thank You. I haven't seen you for a long time. That's right, a long time. How is everything? Well... Ah.. Pim. This is Danai.. an old friend. Hello. Before I went to Korea, we were best friends. About 10 years ago, isn't it? Yes, about 10 years. A long time eh? So, how did you meet again? Oh, Wee called to invite me. How's your work right now? Busy, bacause I work in two jobs. and there are many sick people. What type of Doctor are you? I'm a psychiatrist. Pim. So you think I'm crazy uh? Pim. Pim, just listen first. Pim. Let me explain! Pim! Lucky! Lucky. Pim. Well, the condition of your brain, is generally good. I have a few pictures for you to look at.. and I want you to help me, by telling me what you see. OK? Batman. If I answer like that, it means I'm crazy right? If I answer a butterfly, then I'm fine, right? Coming to see a Psychiatrist, doesn't mean you're crazy. It's not so serious. and we can cure it easily. Wee is very worried about you. I don't want you to be like that. So just tell me what happened. We used to be together permanently. So why did you have the separation? OK, so I think that's enough for today. I'll prescribe some medication.. It's useless. It can't help me at all! It's a type of psychosis. People with this condition, Can't see the difference between reality and imagination. and allied with guilt feelings, creates these visions. Can it be cured? Oh yes. This condition is easily cured. Taking her back to Korea could be enough. But I think we'll be here for some time. I just don't know when her mother will be recover. So if I take her away somewhere for a while, It'll help her recover. I made some food for you. Eat it all. Is it good? Delicious eh? Pim, this is really nice. Pim. Pim. Pim. What is it, Pim? Pim. Pim. Pim. Help me feel good, or she might come. Pim hasn't improved. We need to go back to Korea as soon as possible. That's probably for the best. And please, Don't think I'm crazy too, OK? but did you ever hear, that twins, if one of them dies, the other has to die too? Pim told me.. Ply has come to take her life? Wee, it's just a superstition! No way a twin could affect the other this way. But I think, it's just sympathy for the one that died. for the one that died. Only that. Wee. What's up? Nothing. I thought you went to the hospital again. I bought some food for you. Let's go eat. As for the patient, If you want to transfer her to Korea, I can't approve, it's too soon. We should wait a little longer. Thank you. I'd better go. Yes. Mother... Mother what's wrong? Pim. Wee. It's not safe until she's gone. It's not safe until she's gone. Listen. This ghost you see, is a figment of your imagination. For example Mickey Mouse. You can imagine him, but he's not real. The brain has a part, the part linked to the emotions. it's almost like, things we wish for can really happen. you continue to see your sister, because you are still emotionally connected. Didn't you say you'd seen her in the mirror. Take a good look. Right now, who do you see? Pim. Pim. Come on. It's a result of your decision to separate? Pim, you don't have to feel guilty about that decision. Two people together permanently throughout their lives, is unusual and bound to create some disagreements. We quarrelled fiercely. Ploy didn't want the operation. Did you ever think she was a burden? No, I never thought that. Pim, it's not wrong to want a private life. I... caused her death. If you can stop punishing yourself, you'll not stop seeing her shadow everywhere. Pim. Are you OK? Let's go. It's not real. It's not real. You bought a new one? Lucky. Lucky Ayo here. Lucky. Pim, it's not Lucky. Noi! Take the dog, please. Yes. Ah, Pim. The hospital from Korea said OK. We can go home now. Pim. Do you remember that picture I drew? Was it Ploy who tore it? Don't Ploy! Don't Ploy! Was it because of me that you and Ploy separated? I hate you! I want us to be separated! Why didn't you ever tell me? What should I have said? because of you Ploy died? Ploy! Mother! Wee, did you know? Ploy always loved you. Pim, I believe you have really seen her. but as a Doctor I can't say it's real. Our brains are extremely complex. and the things you've seen are just imagination. imagination which.. Doctor, stop! She's still here, I tell you! She's still here! Pim! Where's Pim? Oh, she's gone? Pim. Wee! Wee! Help me! Pim! Pim. Pim. Pim. Pim. What is it? Look it's me! Wee. Pim, never mind, let's go back to Korea. Come on, let's go to the hospital. Wee. You don't have to be worried.. I'll move your mother tonight. Wee. Wee. Where's the doctor? Why? I want to move my mother right now. OK please stay calm. Please get him for me! OK I'll get him. What is it, mother? Take a good look. right now, who do you see? It's... I see Ploy. Wee. Ploy always loved you. Wee. Mother has died. Where have you been? Why are you wet? How did your mother die? Her condition is much better. and as for moving her to Korea.. tell the hospital to make the arrangements. I just don't know, how she could have deteriorated so fast. It's good that your mother spoke to me before she died. Why? Were you scared she'd tell me something? These are yours aren't they? Are you surprised? Ploy. Wee, what are you saying? It's all a lie right? I went to the temple, to find out what really happened to Pim. Pim died, so tell me the truth Ploy! Let go! It was Ploy who died! Ploy, why did you do it!? No... I'm Pim? I'm Pim. What happened to Pim? Eh? What did you do to her? We can't live like this! I want us to be separated. No, I'm gonna stay like this until we die! Why do you have to be like this? You know, you're just an appendage! I'm not! I'm not an appendage! I don't laden you! Let go! Pim! Pim! Pim! Pim! Mother! Mother! Pim! Mother! Help! Mother! Pim. I didn't mean it! How could you do it? Your own sister! You have lied to me throughout. Why though Wee... I'm the same in every way. Why can't you love me! You are two different people. But after all the time we've been together. Is it worthless? All the times you said you love me. This is not yours. Wee. I never thought... this day would come. Everybody just loved Pim. After she died, My mother never spoke to me again. I became a figure of hate. I love you even more than Pim now. but still, you only want Pim. The letter that you sent to Pim. I persuaded myself that you had written to me. and that you loved me. and I was the same as Pim. The letter that you received... was written by me. You thought you were writing to Pim.. but all along it was me! Poor, poor Pim. because I got all of your love. Is it agony? Wait a second... That isn't her dog right? It couldn't easily be replaced! Why? It was the same in every way! I'm sorry Madam. I left my mobile phone behind. Where? I will bring it for you. I'm not sure, maybe in the kitchen. Wee! Where are you? Come out right now! I will burn the house down! Come out!
