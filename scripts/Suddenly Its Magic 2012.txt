It can change the world so that it's never dark, or sad, or painful. But love is not strong enough to stop your mom from dying; and it can't give you the dad you never really had. So now you're left all alone in the world. Th ere's n 0 magic. Butjust when think you'll never know how that magic feels like, som eon e un exp ectedl y comes along. He's am az'n g. He makes everything better. He makes you smile again. He makes you believe... in the magic you always secretly wish ed were true. I love you, always have, always will. But then it all ends. Cur! The magic has run out. And then, they say, the magic is gone. Magic? Love? None of these are real. You 're so stupid! How could you allow yourself to believe... in what you always knew was just... a beautiful lie? Adeng! Adeng! Adeng! How many cupcakes have you baked? Sorry. I'm just excited to be baking again. Excited or depressed? The last time you baked this much-- Welcome back, Joey! We have enough cupcakes to feed an army! Hans, help me! - Fm helping. If you really want to help, you'd be here. Babe, I'd be there but I can't. Wait a second, baby. Joey! Joey! Come here! It's Hans! - Hello, Joey. How are you ? - I'm fine. Sit! Joey, if its your wedding, which cake would you choose? If it were my wedding, I'd choose the one that would make me the happiest... on the happiest day of my life. - And it would be? - Ch ocolatel No question about it! Then chocolate it is! Thank you very much, Joey! By the way, you are invited to the wedding, okay? Bring your boyfriend. Husband d, Th en ? hm o n m V Way Oh my God! It's Marcus Hanson! Coffee please. I have DVDs of all the movies you've ever made! I loved The Fantastic kid and the Super Cadets! And I was wondering if you could sign these? And I was wondering if you could just give me my coffee. You don't have to be a jerk, you know! But I already am. Serves you right that Sririta left you! Asshole! Shit! What's the big problem? They're spreading lies! How can Ch atree say that he had you when he didn't even cast you ? But not to worry. I already told the press that you didn't even audition... because you have two new movies that you're going to do. Let me guess. I'll be Prince Charming again and I get the girl in the end. What's wrong with that? Lita, I've been acting since I was ten. An d in Th e last five years, half of the movies I've done has me and Sririta getting a happy ending! - But that's what the audience likes! - To hell with the audience! Come on Marcus, you can't let Mitr Nawat take everything from you- - Sririta, your roles, your fan s-- - Let him have it all then! I don't care! What do you want Marcus? I don't want to do another movie with Sririta! Your contract states Th at if Th e sequ el doesn't push through because of you, you have to pay Sririta the rest of her talent fee. Why did we agree to this shitty contract, anyway? Because when you were doing My Special Boy, you were both in love and we all thought it was going to last forever. Marcus, we're so close to getting you that audition with the American director. We don't need a lawsuit right now. We need this to be a hit. We're so close to getting all that we've dreamed of. Marou s, what's going on? I don't wanna be me anymore. Last time I said that, I became a woman. Being an actor... this has always been my dream. But lately, it feels like such a nightmare. I like what I do... I just don't like all the other shit that comes with it... Do you want to walk away from it all? No... I don't know... I feel like... so lost... Then you should be lost. - Come on, please? - Popoy, let me go! Please, stay? Who is that? Bea and John Lloyd in the Philippines. Just like Marcus and Sririta. You know, like this. - Really? - Yes, love team. Solid. You know, Bea is nice. Not a bitch like your Sririta! And John Lloyd is more handsome than you. - Come, you eat. - More good looking than me? Of course! Wait 'til you see Piolo. You don't stand a chance with him! And with Sam, Gerald, and Enchong! Who? You go to my country and no one will notice you. But for sure, when Filipinos see our actors, you'll hear them sh outing, "I love you, John Lloyd", "I love you, Piolo", "I love you, Ate Vi!" You will not hear, "I love you, Marcus!" No one knows you and no one will care. You're right! You're absolutely right! I would love to get lost in your country. Well, you know, it's more fun in the Philippines! - I'm Marcus. - Sir Marcus! Hello! - Welcome to the Philippines, sir! - Thank you. - You know how to speak Filipino, sir? - Just a little. So how was your ?ight from Bangkok to Manila, sir? It was great. - How about Manila to Laoag, sir? - It's good. Good morning, sir. You don't know my name? Sorry, sir, I don't. I'm happy you don't know my name. Here is your cupcake, ma'am. Please enjoy your meal. - Excuse me! - Yes? - Can I have a coffee, please? - Oh, yes, sir. - Dara! - Joey, they smell delicious! Here's a little present for you. Looks like you've had too much to bake. Just a second, Joey. Let me just get the guest's coffee. By the way Joey, have you heard? An actor is staying here in the hotel. - Gu ess. - John Lloyd? Bea? Together? Is he nice? Do you know me? No! Should I? The nerve! - Can I have this cupcake? - Of course, sir. Thank you. Are you alright? This is the saddest tasting cupcake ever! This cupcake is fine. It hasn't gone bad yet. - What? - This cupcake is fine! - It's not okay. It tastes like... Ugh! "ugh ,,.. What do you mean "ugh"? Sir, is there something wrong? There's a problem with this cupcake! There's nothing wrong with this, Dara! There's something wrong with him! Hey you! There's nothing wrong with my cupcake! Nothing wrong with this! - There is! - There isn't! There is! I made these cupcakes and there's nothing wrong with them! - Yeah, there is! - No! Ma'am! That's delicious! It's perfectly fine! This is really good! Sir! Th at cupcake is really good! I made that! I told you it's very good! See, I told you! Water, please! Let me help you, let me help you! Let me help you. Come on! One, two, three! One, two, three! One, two, three, spit it! You got it? I followed your advice, so I got lost here in the Philippines. My housekeeper named all the places I can go to... and llocos sounded the most interesting. And the funny thing is, no matter where I am, there's always a woman in a coffee sh op who thinks I'm an asshole. I think that's the universe telling you to avoid such women. Even if she's cute? Hi, I'm Marcus! - Oh come on! Can we be friends? - After you touched my boobs? But that was an accident. I was trying to save you. But not before you embarrassed me. - You embarrassed yourself! - I had to defend my cupcakes. Defend your cupcakes? You know how funny that sounds? It's funny to you because it's not your name, your job, or your lifelong passion at stake. I almost lost important cu stom ers back Th ere... becau se some arrogant Korean tourist Th ou ght... - Thai. - Thai- Whatever! - Thought my cupcakes were sad. - But that's how it tasted! Sad? It's not even a word for how something tastes. - It's not sad! - You keep saying... Because se Th ere's n oth in g wron g with Th em! You know, even if my life was falling apart, at least there was one thing I was sure of: I can bake. It's is the only thing I can do right with my messed up life... and then you're going to call my cupcakes "sad"? Sad? Maybe they really are sad. Maybe you can all taste how miserable my life is. Why am I telling you all of this anyway? You can't even u n derstan d a word of what I said. Yes, but I can u n derstan d h ow you feel. Graham! I just made another one! What do you think, hon? Oh. It's you. H'he's not here, no one's going to help us carry all this stuff. Hey, sad cupcake girl. You again? What are you doing here? He's the pervert who insulted me yesterday. Hi, I'm Marcus. She said that you're a nuisance. She didn't say that you're cute. You're so handsome! You don't look like a pervert. My God! If only I had breasts, I'd let him grope me! Why are you here? I'm here because you owe me a cupcake. She ate the cupcake I paid for. You owe him! I'm not going to give you another cupcake just so you can call it sad! No! How did you find me anyway? I asked the girl at the hotel. Where is Dan? Adeng! What a handsome guy! Th an k you. You 're h an dsome too. So you know how to speak Filipino? Just a little. Who's coming with us? I can't. Sorry. I can help you. You're kidding, right? Come here! What did your mom say? If God closes a door because of gout, he opens a gate... so that the tourist can come in to help us carry the cake! Hold on. - Do you have gout? - No, no gout. Come here! Ah, no gout. Please help us. So you owe me more than a cupcake now. So, when did you get into the cake business? I've been doing this since I was a kid. My mom put up the shop. And what about your dad, what does he do? How about you, Marcus? What do you do? Well, I'm thinking of quitting my job. That's why I went on a vacation. When will your vacation end? - In two days. - Why so short? I have to really go back because I will be in big trouble. But if I decide to quit, this will be the first place I'll come back to. Sam! Careful! Th e cake! Are you really worried about the cake? Or your heart? . Sam! stop in ' sorry! Now what? You get to watch Joey make magic happen. What you should do is press and push. Press and push. Press and push. So beautiful! - What did you say? - What did you say? - Nothing. - Nothing Are you hurt? Did you hurt yourself? Why are you looking at me like that? Nothing. I just... I envy you. Because se? You're not only good at your job, you actually love it. My mom taught me that there's no point in doing something if you don't love it... or you're not doing it for love. I'm guessing you hate your job. What do you do anyway? Josephine? I heard you made the cake. It's beautiful. Thank you. Dad, let's go. Nice to see you again. Who's that? Th e govern or. This one doesn't taste so sad. - But it's still sad? - A little. I don't owe you a cupcake anymore, okay? No, I'll help you. But you still owe me for saving your life and helping you out today. What? This is already too much. And because I helped you out today, I was not able to do what I wanted to do. And what was that? Go see the sights. Look around. Have fun. My friend Jinggay says there's always a fiesta here in the Philippines. I want to go to the fiesta and you're coming with me. - No, I'm not. - Yes, you're coming with me. I can't. Just take someone else. 'Old! . Boring! - Ex-con vict! - Same same. See, you're the only one that's not old, not boring, not an ex-con. And... same same. And that makes you the perfect tour guide. No. No. No. Sorry, no. Girl, don't play hard-to-get. - I'm not! - What's pakipot"? Please, spend a day with me. Yes, yes, yes! She'll spend the day with you. This is called Kalesa Festival. We have it every year. ' Really . Yes! Lots of horses. Do you have it in Thailand? - No, we don't. - You want to ride? Yes, of course! Thanks. Taste it! Is it good? More! WOW! Come! Dance! - No. - Join us! I want to try that. Go, Marcus! Go, Marcus! Go! Are you okay? Are you hurt? Your shoulder! Thank you for today. Thank you for taking me here. So you tie your dream to the balloon and then? You release it to the universe. And the universe makes your dream come true. The last time I did it with my dad, my dream came true. What was that dream? To become a superhero. Do you still have the same dream? Are you ready? On e, two, three! Do you really believe that the universe will make your dream come true? Of course. Don't you wish everyday could be like this? Like this? Uncomplicated. Happy Perfect. If every day were like this, then this day would be just another day. This day would mean less. I stopped liking fairytales and happy endings a long time ago. But you, you're make me believe in them again. In every Philippine town, there is a church at the center. Almost everything we do begins and ends with a prayer. How do you Pray? I talk to God. I tell Him what's in my heart even if I know that he already knows it. In the end, I know that He will always give me what is best for me. Your church is so beautiful, even if it's very old. We also have very old temples in Thailand. Some are even older than this church. When you go there, I will bring you to my favorite temple. - When I go there? - Yeah! You're sure I'll be able to go there, huh? Yes. One day, when you go to Thailand, I'll bring you to all the nice places there. And we're going to have a perfect day just like this one. Com e, let's pray. They say every time you visit a church forth e first time, God grants your prayer. Your God will grant my prayers even though I'm a Buddhist? I believe there's only one God. We are all one. What are you praying for? I pray that God gets your balloon and that he makes your dream come true. Huh? What did you say? It's between me and God. Hello! Jinggay, what can I do to make a Filipina fall in love with me? . Are you crazy? ' What?! - It's not going to work, Marcus! - Why? I'm going to run out of English! I can barely speak Thai! What are you saying? See? We're different from each other. You know? No, I don't know. Just tell me what I can do... Shut up! It's not a good thing. You're my boss and I still want to live. Your mother will kill me. Your crazy fans will kill me. Jinggay, you're talking nonsense. Just tell me what I can do to make a girl fall in love with me. Marcu s! I can never be your woman so don't fall in love with me! But I'm not in love with you. Oh. What's this? My housekeeper says I have to serenade and oou rt you. Serenade me? Court me? That's how you do it here, right? I like you. - Really? You like me? - Yeah! I'm going to make you fall in love with me too. Marcus, the point of the serenade is to let her know how you feel by singing. Not just playing the instrument. How will she get it if there are no words? Yeah. Dan! Dan! Help me out. Com e h ere. Get ready friends for a grand production number! Why are you helping him? Girl, I'm not helping him. I'm helping you! Get over yourself. You're already getting all the attention! Are you ready? Hey, beautiful girl! You know how happy you make me? Because if you don't, I have to tell you in the universal language of rap! Once upon a time, here in our town there was a lovely girl who bought a wedding gown. She had found her prince charming Smart. Good-looking. A guy named Marvin! The wedding was set, it was all a go But Marvin said goodbye! Oh no, no, no! Oh it was just so bad, Seeing Josephine all so sad. I don't want no sad cupcake no more I don't want no sad cupcake no more I would be the man to put the sugar in the cake Make you love again, be your chocolate. Please be my girl, my happy cupcake girl! Please be my girl, my happy cupcake girl! Please be my girl, my happy cupcake girl! Please be my girl, my happy cupcake girl! What's up, cupcake? Have dinner with me? Go on! Come on! Say yes! Th at took a lot of effort. Rapping ain't easy. Say yes! Okay. The food tonight is very good. I wonder what's going on there? There's a famous actor here in the hotel. Yes, I heard! Maybe it's Piolo! Maybe it's John Lloyd and Bea. And Ate Vi! You know them? My housekeeper, Jinggay, she loves them. Come on, let's look. I want to spend the rest of my life with you. Will you marry me? Yes! Joey? Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey! Magic? Love? None of these are real. How could you be so stupid? How could you allow yourself to believe... in what you always knew was just a beautiful lie? It's not a lie. They may have lied to us, but the love we felt for them, the love we gave them, that was true. That's why it hurts. And that's why we learn to appreciate the next one that comes along. How did you find out? I walked in on them having sex. Sorry. I'm sure that hurt. Yes, it hurt. But what hurts more is seeing her every day, and pretending to like her in front of the camera, for the fan s. You're an actor? Yes, and I'm stuck playing prince charming to my ex. Is that the reason why you want to quit your job? Yes, she's the big reason why I'm not happy anymore. You asked me if I believe in dreams coming true. I guess, if it's destined for you, it will come true. How will you know if it's destined for you? I guess you wouldn't have dreamed it if it wasn't your destiny. And being an actor is the only thing I ever dreamed of becoming. Then don't quit! You're going to let some ex-girlfriend be the reason to quit a job you love? Tell you what. I will race you there. If I win, I will quit acting and live here. If you win, I will fly back to Thailand. Yes? Sure! Ready? On e. Two. Three! - Good morning! - Good morning! Why did you want to meet here? Unfinished business. Marcus, no! Come! Hi, I'm Marcus. I want to thank you. Thank me? Thank you for breaking Joey's heart. Sorry, you are? - Marvin... - Me? I'm her boyfriend. The pain you had caused Joey made her more beautiful in my eyes. And it made me want to love her more. Love her in a way you never could. Love her in the way she should be loved. Congratulations on your upcoming wedding. You deserve each other. Let's go, baby. God bless you, Marcus. Bye, Marcus. Okay. I'll carry your bag. - Marcu s. - Yeah ? Thank you for making my best friend smile again. She made me smile, too. When you get home. Thank you for what you did this morning. Your acting was so good! You almost convinced me that you were my boyfriend. And that you love me. Are you sure it was all acting? That's a line from one of your movies, isn't it? L gotta go- Take care of yourself. Come with me. Even just for a few days. When I get there, I will find a church and I will pray to God for you come to Thailand. It's so easy for you to tell other people to follow their heart... but you can't take your own advice. You 're n ever going to have another boyfriend ever? Do you want to end up like the gifts in your house? Om, dusty, ugly'? Your problem is you always let your imagination get ahead of you. What do you mean ? You haven't even tried yet and you already think you will fail. You're ending something that hasn't even begun. Child, you can't let the fear of getting hurt take control of your heart. If you do, there won't be any room for love. Th ere won't be any room for happiness either. You have to choose to love again. Choose to be happy, Joey! This cupcake doesn't taste sad anymore. Marou s! They seem happy to see me. Aren't you happy to see me? Why are you still here? Your cupcake told me to follow my heart. And my heart led me back here to you. I don't want to just pretend to be your boyfriend. What I want is to be your boyfriend for real. I want to kiss you right now. But I won't, until you tell me that you will be my girl. Please be his girl, his happy cupcake girl! Uh-huh. Uh-huh? What is uh-huh? Yes. Most definitely a yes! Fine. He's in the Philippines. On my fifth birthday, my mom took me here. That was the first and last time that we were all together: me, my mom, and my father. My mom said that we had to let my dad go because he was meant for greater things. Growing up, I felt the reason he walked away from us was because... we weren't good enough for him, that he didn't want us. Maybe, he just didn't love me. And you never saw him after that? But I couldn't call him my dad. But I could call him mayor, before congressman. Now it's govern or. Th e govern or? He and my mom had an affair. I am the secret daughter that no one is supposed to know about. I'm sorry. I couldn't imagine keeping you a secret. You are too good, too beautiful, too wonderful to be kept a secret. Is that another line from your movies? Of course not! It took Marvin a year before I agreed to be his girlfriend. I've only known you for a week and yet I've already fallen for you. I love you. Even if they're with other people, we still hope that John Lloyd and Bea... will still end up together and stay like that forever and ever! You 're sayin g, Th ey n ever even had a relation ship? Ever? Th ey n ever admitted it. But you know every time they look into each oth er's eyes they look so in love! That's good acting. And you? You're acting right now! Marou s! I'm not leaving unless Joey's with me. Joey, I want you to come with me. That's alright. I'll just stay here. Are you sure? I don't want to leave you. It's okay. Marou s! Go! Is it always like this? - No English! - Sorry. Get ready for Marcu s Han son and Sririta Taylor! Can you feel it? I can feel it. Can you feel it? Definitely! How could he? He's still in love with me. I heard you're the one who's still in love with me. Excuse me, excuse me. Do you know where the toilet is? No, no, no! No English. Fine, I'll speak in Filipino then. When Marcus gets here, could you tell him I just went to the toilet, okay? No, no, no. Okay. Of course. It's always fun working with her. Ah, you miss me! Then that means you're still in love with me. Sorry. I'm so sorry. Wait! Wait there! I have something to ask that girl! The girl with the long hair and really pretty eyes. Wait! Don't go! What is he doing? What are you doing here? I was looking for the toilet. The toilet isn't here. I know. Are you sure you're looking for the toilet, not your boyfriend? 'Cause if you're looking for him, I know where he is. Right here. Are you okay? I badly need to pee but you're doing this and suddenly I don't need to pee. Can I go now? Okay, let's go. Come on! Is it true that he serenaded you with a rap song? Yes! Aww, I want to see that! Do it again. - Yes, please. - No! It's bad enough that you're showing her pictures of me wearing superhero tights. I look stupid! No, you actually look cute here. He looks really cute here! Excuse me, I'll just go to the toilet and when I come back, you're going to sh ow Peter how you did the rap, okay? No! Excuse m e. I'm not going to do that. I'll show you where the toilet is. - Do it! - No! You look different! I feel different. We got you an audition with the American director. Really? Wow! - Yes. - Wow! Wow! Mom, remember how dad taught me to tie my dreams to a balloon? It really works! Do you still want to do this, Marcus? Or do you want to give up all of this? What do you mean ? Are you asking me to give up Joey? I'm asking you to take your job seriously, Marcus. You can't have it all. I'm impressed at how Marcus can cry on command. And the moment he starts crying the whole crew starts crying! Even those really brutish technicians and cameramen cry their eyes out! Oh, he's here already. Hi, Marcus! - Have you been here long? - No. So many cupcakes! Who's going to eat all that? Your workmates! Is this enough ? How many people will be in the shooting? A hundred? Or maybe a hundred and fifty? Oh this is not enough! I'll just make more, alright? When you told me you're going to take me to your movie set, I got so excited! It will be my first time to watch a shooting. I've always been curious about what goes on in a shoot and I'm excited to see how you do your job! Joe? How long will your shoot take? Joe? Joey, I can't take you to Th e set tomorrow. The first day on the movie set is usually stressful, you know... I see. It's okay, I u n derstan d. You do? Because if I were you, I wouldn't be so understanding. It's actually better becau se, last week, we were together almost every day. You might get tired of me. Thank you. I promise, I will be home for dinner tomorrow. It's okay. Jinggay will keep me company. Marcus is a national celebrity. Kids idolize him. Everyone wants to be his friend. He's a national sweetheart. People love him 'cause he's a good guy. He became even more famous when he paired up with Sririta. They're the national love team. And all their movies are big hits. Their movies are so romantic! It's like you're watching the movies of... - John Lloyd and Bea? - Exactly! You're also a fan of their love team? John Lloyd and Bea forever! Fm pretty sure Th at your happy en ding with Marcus. will ruin the happy en ding of other people. I don't plan to ruin Their h app y en ding. Peace offering? You're a fan, right? Don't you get upset when you hear that... John Lloyd and Bea are dating other people? - Sit. - A little. I'm sure, that's how Marcus' fans feel. What did she say? She said that you are cute but I'm cuter. But it's better if we eat somewhere else. Come on. This is Lalita. Marcus' phone is with me right now. He's busy shooting a scene. We're supposed to have dinner. He told me he'd be done shooting by this time. Well, he still has two more scenes to shoot. Okay, what time do you think he'll be done? We're shooting now, I have to go! Please tell him I-- hello? I'm sorry. I didn't keep my promise. I wasn't able to come home. You could have at least called or texted me. Sorry about Th at. When I shoot a movie, I lose track of time. I don't look at my phone so I can stay in character. Forgive me, Joey, forgive me. I'm sorry, I don't want to be in a bad mood. How are you? How was your day? It was good. Actually, I had fun. Even with all the scenes with Sririta. You're really good at being a prince charming. I'm a fan of you and Sririta. You both kiss so passionately. Joey! I know it's a part of your job. It's all pretend. But during the time you were together, you loved her. Th at wasn't pretend. That's why all the kisses were real. It's okay. I know it's different now. Yes, it is. From the moment we first kissed, all my real kisses have been reserved just for you. I missed you. I'll make it up to you. I'll bring you to the set tomorrow. - I'll just wait here. - No, come on. Cut! Kiss on the lips, kiss on the lips! You hate it too, don't you? Watching them kiss? I'm Mitr. I know who you are. I'm glad you met Marcus an d n ow you're together. Makes you feel less guilty about what you did to him. No. At least now, I'm not alone in being the bad guy... in the Marcu s-Sririta love story. Welcome to the club. What are they saying? And please tell me the truth because Marcus and Jinggay, try to spare my feelings all the time. Do you really want to know? They say we're both ugly and we belong in hell together. I don't care about any of you! He loves me! Me! Me! Me! And not that two-timing idol of yours! So sorry because he loves me! He loves me! Me! And I love him! I love him! I love him! Can I do that? - Come. You say, "I'm a jerk!" - I'm a jerk! - But he loves me! Me, me, me! - But she loves me! Me, me, me! You really love Sririta, don't you? Yeah, I really love her because she makes me smile, she makes me happy. What? The producers convinced him to stay but Mitr and Joey are banned from the set. Marcus, what possessed you to bring her to the set? I love her! Good evening ma'am. Sorry, I don't u n derstan d. You really don't understand. Your mother is right. You need to focus on your career. - I don't want to be a burden to you. - I don't want to neglect you. You really need to focus. Thank you. This is my favorite temple. The one that I promised I will bring you to. He just gave us a blessing. See, I told you we didn't have to go out of town. We could have stayed home. You 're really tired. I'm alright. I'm not tired. I'm happy that you're with me. I told you we'd have a perfect day like the one we had in llocos. Th an k you very mu ch Marcu s. I'm sorry about that. What did the old woman say? She told me how much she loved my movies with Sririta. So many people want you and Sririta together, no? Yeah, well... I will take you to Chiang Mai on Monday. Don't you have something to do on Monday? Yeah, just a meeting with some producer. I will just tell Lalita to reschedule that. Why would you do that? Don't cancel your meeting. Your fans are already disappointed. You wouldn't want the person you're meeting with to get mad too. They might blame it on me again. You know how awful it is to have people frown, roll their eyes... and cuss at me simply because I love you? What? Slow down! I didn't get what you said. Your fans are mad at you. They're mad at me because you can celled on their event today. But if I didn't cancel, I won't be here with you and you will be the one who's mad at me. I'm not going to be mad at you, Marcus. Yeah, right! I see how hurt and how disappointed you are every time I can't make it to dinner... or I leave you alone with Jinggay. I see how uncomfortable you are when I work with Sririta. Of course I'm not comfortable with that! She's your ex-girlfriend. You know what? When you got into a fight with Mitr I realized you may not be over her. - Maybe you haven't really moved on. - What?! I punched the guy because he's a jerk! I didn't get a word of what you said. All I know is that you're mad. Yes, I'm mad and I'm not in the mood to translate whatever I just said to you. I'm sorry Mai but you better straighten out your boy. There's even a rumor that Happy Cola is dropping him as an endorser. It's not true. We are supposed to have a meeting with them today. But you're not having the meeting with them today, are you ? I don't want no sad cupcake no more. I don't want no sad cupcake girl no more. . I'm sorry. . I'm sorry. I just want us to have a happy, uncomplicated, perfect day. Me too. Oh no! Joey, get up! It's nine thirty! Your audition! Wait! I'll pack your things. - I'll get everything, okay? - Okay, I'll call Lalita. Lalita, I'm on my way. Please tell the Americans I'm on my-- I've got everything, now let's... Everything will be okay. Sorry, what? I'll see you later. You probably think I don't like you... but I like you. I know you'd be good for my son. Thank you. But not now- not when he's on the verge of becoming the biggest superstar in Thailand. Not when he's so close to getting his dream of making it in Hollywood too. I know my son. He is in love with you. He's changing his schedule for you, canceling events. I didn't know. I didn't ask him to do that. He also asked Lalita to get a private jet... to take you to take you back and forth to Manila whenever you like. - I didn't ask for that either! - I know. He will give you the world even if you never ask for it. Everyone thinks I keep pushing my son to do more... because I got frustrated with my career after I married his dad. But I'm happy with where I am. I push him because I don't want him to end up like his father. Are you okay? I'm sorry. I hope I didn't worry you too much. I asked the universe for help. Maybe the American director will give me a second chance. Maybe the endorsers still believe in me. I wish my movie with Sririta doesn't flop. I was praying the same things for you. You're leaving? You don't want to be with me anymore? Marcus, I want to be with you but not if being with you... would mean you lose this dream you've worked so hard for. You've gone a long way because you worked hard for all of this. And you wanted this even before you wanted to be with me. And I don't want you to lose all of this. I don't want you to regret anything. - Joey, we can make this work. - How? I visit you here, you visit me there? If that's what it takes, yes! No. Then I will be with you. I will go to llocos. Marou s, what will you do there? I will be happy with you. No, how will you make a living? I don't know. I will figure it out. What if you figured out along time ago... that acting is the only thing that you want to do? That it's the only thing that's worth doing? That it's the only thing that makes you happy? I... can give it up for you. I would be happy with that. If it was really okay to give all of it up, you wouldn't have prayed for all Th e thin gs you prayed for. I'm not sure you'll be happy without your dream. I miss him a lot too. Your dad wasn't always an English teacher. When we met, he was a rising football star in his country. But he gave it all up so he can come here and support my career. I didn't know that. He knew teaching was just a job. It wasn't his passion. But, even if he hated his job, he went to work every day. He was doing it because he loved me and he loved you. I didn't know. I told Joey that I didn't want you to have any regrets in your own life. I want you to seize every opportunity Th at com es your way... because the worst thing that could happen is that... you pick the love of your life over the life that you love... and you end up hating them both in the end. You must miss her a lot. I'm sorry about your girlfriend and I'm sorry about the audition you lost. Marou s! Marou s! I just got a call from the American director. You get another chance to audition. - What? - What? They're just as delicious as your mom's cupcakes. Mom said she let you go because she loved you. She wanted you to achieve your dream of helping people. And she didn't want us to get in the way of that. Sh e said Th at was our sacrifice for you because we love you. Sorry. All my life, I never really understood that. Not until I let go of Marcus. Marvin left me heartbroken... but it's different with Marcus. We might not have lasted long... but my heart is not broken. In fact, now, my heart's stronger, bigger, happier. If mom were here, she'd say the same thing about you. Do you think you made the right choice of letting him go? It's such a waste! It's okay! And besides, I'm happy for him. And I could just watch his movies here. Are You ha Yes! Ppy? Are you sure you're happy? A hundred percent sure? - There's no reason not to be. - Be honest! Yes! Ah Marcus!!! Because you won't go to him, I brought him here. I thought you're over him? I was just surprised, that's all. - Don't deny it's obvious, Joey! - They're good! Try them. - Is this good? - Yes! It's bitter! Let's ask Marcus. Is it good, Marcus? He says it's bitter! Dad? Sam and I went there earlier. I really do appreciate your help. Yes, alright. See you later for din n er. - Is everything set? - Very much! Alright, let me help you. Reminds you of someone? Joey! Where did all those balloons come from? - From us! - What's with all the balloons? This is for our dream. What is it that you're so eager to send those balloons to the universe? We only have one dream - to see you happy. ' Am happy - Really? Yes! Of course, you'd be happier if you were with the person you love. Yes, we want you to be with him. All together now! - Hey girl, Joey, we want you to be happy! - Hey girl, Joey, we want you to be happy! - Hey girl, Joey, we want you to be happy! - Hey girl, Joey, we want you to be happy! - Hey girl, Joey, we want you to be happy! - Hey girl, Joey, we want you to be happy! - Is it really you? - Of course it is. Why are you here? I just finished shooting a movie in the U.S. I'm getting all of my dreams because you set me free. But all of my dreams would mean more if you're with me. I still love you. I still love you too. But if we do this again, how will this time be different? I would like to think and to believe that this time, we're stronger. We're more grown up. We know better. And because we know what it's like to be apart from each other. And no matter how tough things get, we're not going to let each other go again. Will you be with me? Yes. - I miss you. - I love you.
