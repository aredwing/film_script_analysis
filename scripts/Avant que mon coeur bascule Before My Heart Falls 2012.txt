That's nice. - That could've turned ugly. - It was just a guy. - Be right back. - Thanks. What's that? Show me. Cute, huh? Looks like her mother dropped her on her head. Retarded mom, happy baby. One of you is lying. He says it's him, you say it's you. You're a cute pair. I don't give a shit who fucked up. You're both gonna pay. Light a smoke for me. We cost them $2,000. So now they want $4,000. Who? People... The ones we fucked over. - Who? - Ouellet and his crew. - Sarah! - What are you doing? Holy shit! Get off it! Oh fuck! Come on, hit me harder. That's not hard enough. You want me to smack you? Do you hitchhike a lot? Now and then. - Do you? - No. I used to, before I had a car. That's probably why I stop and give people rides now. Or maybe it's just because you're a guy. What does that mean? Not very many women pull over. If I were a woman, I'd give a girl a ride. Do you only give rides to girls? No, but to be honest, guys make me a bit nervous. What are you studying? I haven't made up my mind yet. I really like history. That's what I teach. - What school do you go to? - Frenette. Oh yeah? Who's your teacher? Louis Dagenais and Jean-Guy Brossoit. I don't know them. You wanna go get a drink? Or do you have to get home? I have to get home. One drink won't kill you. I can't. Call your wife. You don't even need to call her. It's just one drink. - That's the same as lying. - What difference does it make? Once you start leaving out things, your relationship is doomed. What do you have if you don't have honesty? Come on, everybody lies. Wrong. Dead wrong. When you lie, you're turning your back on reality. It's like erasing things out of fear or cowardice. Not necessarily. Look at history. Sometimes you gotta lie to protect yourself or others. Sure, you can lie for a good cause, but the truth eventually comes out. So how about admitting you lied about where you studied? I know all the teachers there. There's nobody named Dagenais or Brossoit. Give me back my wallet. Give me your ring. Hurry up! Don't do this. - Drop your pants. - What? Drop your pants so I can get the fuck out of here! Now! - Please... - Faster. Come on, breathe. Breathe! It's gonna be all right. Forget about it. It was an accident. It's not your fault. Louis! Stop it! - Go get it! - Kick it to me! Over here! Hello! I'm here about the wallet. I'm the one who called. What did you say? I don't want it! Why did you make me come all the way here then? You volunteered. You don't want it anymore? You want a reward, is that it? Can I use your bathroom? Top of the stairs. I found it like that. I thought you'd be happy to get it back. Where exactly did you find it? - Here? - No. Farther up, I think. After the turnoff. Mind if I smoke? Open your window, please. I think it was here. It all looks the same now. Was it before or after the turnoff? Think. Have a good look. It'll come back to you. OK... out. - What? - Get out and look around. Think hard, for Christ's sake! It'll come back to you. It was here! Right here, I'm sure. It was out in the open. Here. After all that driving around, you don't even wanna see? Take the money so we can get out of here. - Don't you believe me? - Yeah, I do. I don't know what I'm doing here. They must've tossed it out the window. Stop it! Are you crazy? Am I gonna see you again? What for? - I dunno. - "I dunno." Here, put your number in there. I'll text you. This is where I used to live when I was little. Don't you believe me? Sure, I believe you. What are you doing here? I came to see you. I wanna register. How did you know I work here? You told me. I don't remember saying that. Go to the registrar's office. They'll take care of you. Can't you do it? I'm a teaching consultant, not a guidance counsellor. I work with faculty, not students. Anyway, it's too late for you to start this term. And it's too early to register for the winter term. You're kind of stuck in between. What do you want to study? I don't know. You must have some idea if you're here. I don't know... History, maybe. I came to see if you were all right. You think I need your help to fill out an application form? I talked to the police. They want to ask you some questions about the wallet. Do you mind? How did you come across it exactly? I was walking along the highway. - You do that a lot? - I hang out there sometimes. Why? I go ATVing there. You know you're not supposed to. - Everybody does it. - That's not a good reason. How do you think the wallet ended up there? I don't know. You said it was thrown out of a car. That's what I figured. I see. Have you ever been out hitchhiking in that area? - No. - You sure? Yeah. No, that one. What did you tell the cops? Louis told me they questioned you. You trying to get out of paying your debt? - That's got nothing to do with it! - It's got everything to do with it! Stop it! Fucking retard! Sarah! You're wasting your time with those two. - Over here! - I'm telling you... Here! - I wanna see Ouellet. - He's not here. Yeah. The girl's here. I don't know. You got the cash? Let me talk to him. Fine. Get lost. He doesn't want to see you. - Give me his number. - I can't. Hello. What are you doing here? I lost my silver bracelet. I didn't find anything. I tried texting you. You didn't answer. My phone's dead. You wanna come in? - Are you busy? - No, no. Come in. I'm not busy. Damn! The only pants I have that fit. They're always too short. And when they're long enough, they're too loose! You're lucky you're tall. My family's a bunch of dwarves. My husband, now there was a dwarf. This tall, I swear! And that was if he stood up straight. At first, he thought he didn't stand a chance with me. Too short. He really thought I was doing him a favour, going out with him, that I was doing it out of pity. What a moron I was. With my short pants and a bitchy look on my face... as if I was better than him. Are you interested in any of this? Yeah, sure. When you go to someone's house, you listen to them. I'm listening. You were talking about kids. I was talking about not having kids. It's not the same. For me, it was out of the question. No way. For him, it was a must. The absurdity of a life without children... But what if you don't love them? That happens, doesn't it? Do you regret it? What, not having kids? Being alone. Turn it up! Don't leave me here alone. You're not alone. The doctor's coming. Wait with me, please. Why do you keep showing up? I don't know... Why? Because there's nobody else. Another beer? - Ouellet wants his money. - We don't have it. Leave him alone! I'm the one who fucked it up! You're gonna have to find a way to pay. - I can't. - Sure you can. You have to. Worse comes to worst, we'll throw a skirt on you and put you to work. I'll see you back here in three days. Got it? Got it? Why the hell did you go see them? We didn't, for Christ's sake. They came after us! She tried to arrange a meeting with Ouellet. - I thought I could... - What? You thought you could what? - That's not up to you! - It would've made you happy. That's not up to you! There's no talking. They want their money. Once we pay them, that's that. You can't talk your way out of a debt. Why didn't you tell me? I would've gone with you. Fucking unbelievable. You should work instead of drinking tea with your widow. He'll get his goddamn money! Well, I just found us a sweet little gas station that's gonna pay off big time. No more jobs with people around. You'll fucking do what you have to do. Why are you hanging around with the widow anyway? We're your family. You wanna get us arrested? Stop going to see her. Is that clear? - You got her address? - Yeah. - How'd you get that? - I followed you. Stop it! Let me go! Franoise? - How's your mother? - Fine. - And your sister? - Fine. I went to your house. That's quite the story you told me. You been drinking? Sold. Told you. Here. Go buy yourself something. No thanks. You helped me out. You deserve it. - Who's that? - My sister. Why don't you go talk to her? We've never been close. Do you want that? He never wore it. Stop. I'll sleep downstairs. You should sleep here. That's what you want. What I want? How do you know what I want? It's good that we're doing this. Go do the office. I'll finish up the bedroom. It hurts here. Yeah. How about here? But not here? No. Take a deep breath and hold it. OK, breathe in. Let it out. You're very tense. You have to relax. That's what hurts. The jewellery you brought me is fake. It's worthless. - And you knew it. - No, I didn't! You're lying to me. You did it on purpose. What are you up to? - Are you with us or against us? - I'm with you. I didn't fuck things up, you did! You have to deliver now. - Ask them for another week. - Are you kidding me? You can't talk your way out of a debt! Enough screwing around, little girl. Time to pay up. You went back to see the widow. What did we agree on? Stop calling her "the widow." We didn't agree on anything. Who do you think you are? You're not my father. Come with me. You, stay here. - What's your problem? - We're going to the hardware store. Give me a light. How do you like that? Don't be scared. I've got you! - Close your eyes! - Put me down, for Christ's sake! Sounds like the ocean. If I let go, you'll fall. And if you fall, I fall too. We have to stick together. Get it? You sure? Come on! You little son of a bitch! Sarah, I need your help! I'm taking it easy. Which one? The boy. He's cute, don't you think? On June 28, 1914, what event triggered World War I? The assassination of Archduke Ferdinand. In what year did Israel become a country? Why did you lie to me? Did you really want to get a drink or you just wanted to rip me off? I'm freezing. The money! - Give me the fucking money! - Hurry up! Watch him. Out of the way. - What's your fucking problem? - Shut the hell up! We only got $300. We have to go somewhere else. Get out of here! You're fucking crazy! - Don't you talk to me like that! - You shouldn't have done that! Where are you going? Sarah! What's going on? - I need money. - What for? If you lend it to me, I'll stop bugging you. You're not bugging me. What's going on? Good night. Franoise! What is it? Can I sleep with you? I don't feel so good. Now get some sleep. Good night. Good night. Franoise? What? Can I come live with you? I don't think so. We'll talk about it tomorrow, OK? I like being around you. I won't cuddle with you for too long. I can't sleep that way anyway. What do you want? I left you a bunch of messages. Ji-Guy wants to talk to you. Don't go. If I don't go out there, they'll come in here. I'll take care of you, Sarah. What do you want? Get down here. It's gonna be all right. It's gonna be all right. Your plants need to be watered. They're bone dry. You started heating your house? That's a huge tax bill. What's the place assessed at? $600,000? Up from $450,000 last year? That's one hell of a jump. You gonna challenge it? There are two kids sleeping upstairs. I'm begging you, please leave us alone. His wallet is in the front hall. My purse is in the kitchen. I'm turning the hot tub on! Bernard Pierre, lawyer. Is that you? - And what do you do? - Massage therapist. Very cool. I like to get massaged... Does she give nice rubdowns, big guy? I'm talking to you! It's like sleeping outside. It's like sleeping outside. It's like sleeping outside... My problems are gone. All my problems are gone. I've got a normal life. I'm a normal girl. Are you almost done? There's $100 in the desk. Take the TVs. Take anything you want. $100 in a mansion like this? Are you shitting me? - Take our bank cards. Go to an ATM. - We're not in a hurry. You're getting yourself into some serious trouble. I'm so scared! That's enough! What? Let's go. - We looked everywhere. - Look again. I'll pull up the floors if I have to! - You're gonna get us caught. - Me? That's a good one. There are two kids upstairs. I don't give a fuck. These people are loaded. I can smell it! Go. We don't need you anymore. Give me my ring. Hurry up! Drop your pants. Drop your pants so I can get out of here. Do it! Give me my ring. You're not even wearing it. I don't give a shit if you stay. I'm going. Let's empty their bank accounts and then we'll take off. It'll be too late. People will be leaving for work. They'll see us. Stop them! The kids are getting away! Sarah! Go away. You can't just show up on my doorstep whenever you like. I was up all night! I'm not a teenager! Who do you think you are? What do you want from me? What did I do to you? You got nowhere to go, is that it? You need money? I'm not your mother. I don't have to love you. Go away! Get out of here! Why did you come back? I don't know where you found this. You're wrong. This isn't ours. What? I love you, Franoise. Translation: Shonda Secord
