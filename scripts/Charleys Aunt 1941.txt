THAT IS ONE OF THE SILLIEST QUESTIONS I'VE EVER HEARD FROM A STUDENT. YOU HIT ME ON THE HEAD WITH A HARD CRICKET BALL, CREATING A CONDITION OF TORTICOLLIS- A STIFF NECK, TO YOU- THEN YOU ASK ME WHETHER I'M HURT. WELL, I ASSURE YOU, I WAS ENTIRELY ACCIDENTAL. JUST A LUCKY HIT. THAT'S ALL. I MEAN A- BABBS, I THINK YOU'D BETTER GO BACK TO THE GAME. YES, BEFORE YOU SAY ANYTHING MORE. AM I HURT. DO YOU REALIZE, BRASSETT, SOMEDAY THA YOUNG IDIOT WILL SIT IN THE HOUSE OF LORDS? YES, SIR. GOD SAVE THE QUEEN. DON'T LET I UNNERVE YOU, OLD MAN. COME ON, BABBS. HIT UP SOME SIXES. YOU CAN DO IT. VERY WELL. LOOK. THERE ARE THE GIRLS. YES, BUT OLD SPETTIGUE IS WITH THEM. WHAT'S THE SCORE NOW? THAT GIVES US 60 TO THEIR 88. JOVE. THAT MAKES IT CLOSE, DOESN'T IT? IT DOES, RATHER, YES. TEA! GOOD OLD TEA. GOOD ON YOU, BABBS. GREAT HITTING. WELL PLAYED, BABBS. WELL PLAYED, BABBS. SUGAR, OLD MAN? WHERE'S OLD REDCLIFFE? MAYBE IF I BROUGHT HIM SOME TEA, HE'D CALM DOWN A BIT. HE'S OVER THERE, BABBS. OH, YES. THANK YOU- I'M EXCEEDINGLY SORRY, SIR. ANOTHER LUCKY HIT, EH? YES, SIR. I MEAN, NO, SIR. I RATHER LIKE FIRES, DON'T YOU? RATHER. NOTHING LIKE A JOLLY OLD FIRE, I ALWAYS SAY. OH, THAT'S INTERESTING. I'VE ALWAYS HAD A BIT OF A PASSION FOR THEM MYSELF. REALLY? WELL, WHAT DO YOU SAY WE HAVE ANOTHER SPOT OF TEA... AND SEE WHAT'S BURNING? OH, PERFECT. LORD BABBERLY. LORD BABBERLY! HUH? WHAT HAPPENED? THAT IS WHAT I INTEND TO FIND OUT IN MY STUDY... AT HALF-PAST 10:00 IN THE MORNING. DISGRACEFUL CONDUCT. WORST STUDENT AT OXFORD. DARLING KITTY- MY DEAR KITTY. DARLING KITTY. KITTY, MY DARLING, I- WANT SOMETHING, BABBS? NO, NO. I JUST CAME TO BORROW MY WHITE TIE... YOU BORROWED FROM ME LAST NOVEMBER. DO YOU MIND? I SHAN'T KEEP IT LONG. NO, NOT AT ALL, MAN. GO RIGHT AHEAD. IT'S THE ONE WITH THE CHERRY STAIN ON IT. KITTY, MY DARLING. I SAY, JACK, WHERE DO YOU KEEP MY TIES? PLEASE, BABBS. I'M THINKING. I'M TRYING TO PU A SPEECH TOGETHER. AND I'M TRYING TO PUT MYSELF TOGETHER. WHERE'S MY TIE? KITTY, MY DARLING. IN ALL THIS WORLD, THERE IS NO ONE QUITE LIKE YOU. FLATTERY WON'T HELP YOU ANY. I WANT MY TIE. OH, I WASN'T SPEAKING TO YOU. I'M REHEARSING A SPEECH. KITTY'S COMING TO LUNCH, AND I'VE GOT TO PROPOSE TO HER DIRECTLY AFTER. THAT'S ALL VERY INTERESTING, BUT I WANT MY TIE. I'VE GOT TO WORK FAST. OLD SPETTIGUE'S TAKING KITTY AND AMY OFF TO SCOTLAND TONIGHT. HE WANTS TO GET THEM AWAY FROM CHARLEY AND ME. WHAT'S THE MATTER? AFRAID YOU WON' MARRY THEM? NO, HE'S AFRAID THAT WE WILL. YOU SEE, HE'S THEIR GUARDIAN. GETS A SALARY FOR IT. AS SOON AS THEY MARRY, HIS INCOME STOPS. AND THERE'S MY BAG. I KNEW I DIDN'T PAWN IT. IF YOU DON'T MIND, OLD MAN, I THINK I'LL KEEP IT A LITTLE LONGER. I'M GOING AWAY NEXT WEEKEND. SO AM I. OH, NOW, DON'T BE A BOUNDER, BABBS. WE'LL TOSS A COIN FOR IT. HELLO. OH, HELLO, CHARLEY. HAVE YOU MET YOUR AUN ALREADY? NO, I'M ON MY WAY NOW. I DREAD IT. IT'S BAD ENOUGH MEETING AN AUNT YOU KNOW, BUT TO MEET ONE YOU DON'T KNOW- HER NAME'S ENOUGH TO SCARE ME- - DONNA LUCIA D'ALVADOREZ. - THAT'S NOT AN AUNT. THAT'S A CIGAR. IMAGINE. HE DOESN'T EVEN KNOW WHAT SHE LOOKS LIKE. IT'S NOT MY FAULT. SHE WEN TO BRAZIL BEFORE I WAS BORN. BE PREPARED, CHARLEY. SHE'S PROBABLY A HIDEOUS OLD LADY WITH SUFFRAGETTE TENDENCIES. I WOULDN'T EVEN BOTHER MEETING HER. WELL, HIDEOUS OR NOT, SHE DID ALL RIGHT DOWN THERE. MARRIED SOME BRAZILIAN ON HIS DEATHBED... AND CAME AWAY WITH MILLIONS. MILLIONS? WHY, CHARLEY, WHAT ARE YOU STANDING HERE FOR? HOW WOULD YOU LIKE I IF YOU WERE A LITTLE OLD LADY... AND HAD TO WAI AT THE STATION ALL ALONE? GO AND FETCH HER, CHARLEY. THERE'S PLENTY OF TIME. OH, IS THERE? NOW, MIND YOU, DON'T MISS HER. YOU KNOW HOW STRIC KITTY AND AMY ARE. IF YOUR AUNT ISN'T THERE TO CHAPERONE THEM, NO LUNCHEON. DON'T WORRY. I WON' MISS HER. OH, I SAY, JACK. DO YOU MIND IF I BORROW A FEW OF THESE? I'M EXPECTING SOME FRIENDS IN THIS AFTERNOON. OH, I'M SORRY, BABBS, BUT WE'LL NEED EVERY DROP FOR LUNCHEON. OH, THAT REMINDS ME. I'VE GOT TO BE CHANGING. WELL, THAT'S GRATITUDE- BORROWS MY TIES AND MY SWEATERS. THE MOMENT I ASK FOR A FEW BOTTLES OF CHAMPAGNE- YES, BRASSETT? I JUST RAN INTO MR. WIGGINS, MILORD. HE'D LIKE YOU TO STOP BY HIS SHOP AND TRY ON YOUR VARSITY SHOW COSTUME. OH, I HAVEN'T TIME FOR THA NOW. I TELL YOU WHAT YOU DO. YOU GO FETCH THE COSTUME, BRING I TO MY ROOMS, AND I'LL TRY IT ON LATER. IT'S A BIT OF A DISTANCE, MILORD, WITH A BUNDLE. I'M AFRAID I'LL HAVE TO TAKE A CAB. OH, A CAB. OF COURSE. A CAB. UH, JUST A MOMENT. I'LL GET IT. OH, I SAY, CHARLEY. COULD YOU LEND ME A HALF CROWN, PLEASE? SORRY, BABBS. I'M FLAT. I'LL GET IT FOR YOU THOUGH. JACK? HMM? HAVE YOU, UH, HALF A CROWN? NOT A HA'PENNY. JUST A MOMENT. LEND ME HALF A CROWN, WILL YOU, BRASSETT? CERTAINLY, SIR. THANK YOU. HERE YOU ARE, CHARLEY. OH, THANKS, OLD MAN. HERE WE ARE. THANK YOU, CHARLEY. AWFULLY DECENT OF YOU. THE CAB WILL BE TWO SHILLINGS. KEEP THE CHANGE, BRASSETT. OH, THANK YOU, MILORD. THANK YOU. THERE YOU ARE. OH, BUT THAT'S SUCH A BOTHER, SIR. NO BOTHER AT ALL. "ENTERED ST. OLDE'S COLLEGE, MICHAELMAS TERM, 1880." SO FAR YOUR RECORD IS MOS ADMIRABLE. THANK YOU, SIR. LET'S SEE NOW. MY WORD. YOU'VE BEEN HERE A LONG TIME. HOPE YOU REALIZE THERE'S A REGULATION... WHICH SAYS A STUDEN MAY COMPLETE THE COURSE... IN NOT LESS THAN THREE YEARS AND NOT MORE THAN 15. BUT I'M ONLY IN MY TENTH YEAR, SIR. WHAT IS THIS? OH, I DIDN'T KNOW SHE WAS MARRIED, SIR. WHEN I SAID YOU WERE TO BE RUSTICATED, I WAS WRONG. THANK YOU, SIR. YOU, SIR, ARE NO LONGER A MEMBER OF THIS UNIVERSITY. YOU'RE EXPELLED! EXPELLED? OH, BUT PLEASE, SIR. I MUST GET MY DEGREE. YOU SEE, I'M DUE TO JOIN MY UNCLE'S FIRM IN THE FALL- HOGARTH, HAWKS AND BABBERLY- THE FAMOUS LONDON SOLICITORS. THEY'VE HANDLED SEVERAL SENSATIONAL MURDER TRIALS, AND I'M SURE, MR. REDCLIFFE, IF YOU EVER HAVE OCCASION TO COMMIT MURDER, I CAN GET THEM TO HANDLE YOUR CASE. YOU CANNOT BRIBE ME, SIR. LORD BABBERLY, YOU'RE EXPELLED. OH, NO, SIR. THEY WON'T TAKE ME IN WITHOUT AN OXFORD DEGREE. IT'S TRADITION, YOU KNOW. YOU SHOULD HAVE THOUGHT OF ALL THAT BEFORE YOU RANG THE FIRE BELL. BUT I DIDN' DO IT PURPOSELY. I FELL DOWN THE STAIRS. I WAS UNCONSCIOUS. JUDGING FROM YOUR SCHOLASTIC RECORD, I SHOULD THINK IT... EXTREMELY DIFFICULT FOR YOU TO DETERMINE WHETHER YOU WERE UNCONSCIOUS OR NOT. I ASSURE YOU, SIR, IT WAS AN ACCIDENT. I TRIPPED. I- I HAVE WITNESSES. AND WHO ARE THE WITNESSES? WELL, CHARLES WYKEHAM AND JACK CHESNEY. WYKEHAM AND CHESNEY? THEY'RE TWO VERY REPUTABLE GENTLEMEN. WILL THEY TESTIFY TO THAT? OH, I'M SURE THEY WILL, SIR. THEY WERE RIGHT THERE WHEN IT HAPPENED, AND I KNOW I CAN REFRESH THEIR MEMORY. VERY WELL. BRING THEM HERE A HALF-PAST 10:00 IN THE MORNING. IF THEY CORROBORATE YOUR STORY, I'LL RECONSIDER. IF NOT- OH, THANK YOU, SIR. THANK YOU SO MUCH. GOOD DAY. GOOD DAY, SIR. GOOD DAY. DID HE SAY 10:00 OR HALF-PAST? MY NECK! SO AS YOUR SOLICITOR, DONNA LUCIA, I THOUGHT IT ONLY FAIR... TO ACQUAINT YOU WITH THE FACTS. AND I'M MOST GRATEFUL. OF COURSE, I DON'T MIND CHARLEY FALLING IN LOVE, BUT AS HIS ONLY LIVING RELATIVE, I DO HOPE IT'S THE RIGHT GIRL. EXACTLY. NOW, I DON'T SAY THAT THE GIRL IS A FORTUNE-HUNTER, MIND YOU, BUT I WOULDN'T PUT I BEYOND HER GUARDIAN. MR. SPETTIGUE'S REPUTATION IS NONE TOO SAVORY. IF I COULD ONLY MEET THE YOUNG LADY... AND JUDGE FOR MYSELF, I'D- - SUPPOSE I WENT INCOGNITO? - SPLENDID. YES, BUT HOW WOULD I GET ABOUT UNESCORTED? OH, I CAN FIX THAT. I'LL GIVE YOU A LETTER TO MY NEPHEW, LORD FANCOURT BABBERLY, AND ASK HIM TO SHOW YOU AROUND OXFORD. YES? OH, NO. NO. - NO? - NO, THAT WON'T DO. HE'S A FRIEND OF CHARLEY'S AND HE MIGHT WARN HIM. BUT DON'T TELL HIM WHO I AM. SAY THAT I'M, UH- I'M, UH, MRS. BEVERLY SMITH. RIPPING! OH- WHAT'S THE MATTER? WELL, I'M JUST THINKING- "SMITH. SMITH." RATHER AN ORDINARY NAME... FOR A FIRM OF OUR REPUTATION TO BE CONNECTED WITH, DON'T YOU THINK? WELL, HOW ABOU MRS. BEVERLY SMYTHE? OH, NOW- NOW, THAT'S MUCH BETTER. THANK YOU. THANK YOU SO MUCH. OH, JACK? I SAY, JACK? OH, JACK? HELLO, CHARLEY. DID YOU MEET MY UNCLE? I MEAN, YOUR AUNT? NO. SHE WASN'T ON THE 11:00. WELL, THAT'S TOO BAD. I HOPE SHE, UH- I HOPE SHE ISN'T LOST. SHE'LL PROBABLY BE IN ON THE 12:15. NOW, BABBS, THAT'S NO VERY SPORTING OF YOU. YOU SAID I MIGHT KEEP I OVER THE WEEKEND. I DID NOT. AND BESIDES, I WANT TO HAVE MY INITIALS PUT ON IT. THAT CAN WAIT TILL MONDAY. JACK, LOOK OUT! THAT'S MY BAG. CHARLEY, THAT'S MY BAG. LOOK OUT. I OUGHT TO BASH YOUR CRUMPET. YOU MIGHT HAVE CRACKED THE LEATHER. I SAY, YOU ARE IN A TEMPER. WHA HAPPENED? DID OLD REDCLIFFE FINE YOU? FINE ME? HE'S GONNA SEND ME DOWN. WHAT? YOU'D THINK YOUNG STAFFORD WOULD BE SPOR ENOUGH TO ADMIT HE'D KNOCKED YOU OUT. HE DIDN'T KNOCK ME OUT. I TRIPPED- AND I'VE GOT WITNESSES TO PROVE IT. REALLY? WHO? YOU AND CHARLEY. ME? I WASN'T ANYWHERE NEAR THE PLACE. AND I WAS ON THE CRICKET FIELD. YOU WERE BOTH SITTING ON THE TOP STEP, AND DON'T FORGET THAT IN REDCLIFFE'S OFFICE TOMORROW. SO THAT'S IT. OH, NOW I REMEMBER. WE WERE SITTING ON THE TOP STEP. EXACTLY. YES, AND I WAS SITTING IN YOUR LAP. OH, STOP SPOOFING. OH, I SAY, CHARLEY. YOU CAN' BE THERE TOMORROW MORNING. OH, NO. OF COURSE. I SHALL BE DRAGGING MY AUNTIE ABOUT. BUT, CHARLEY- AND I'VE GO TO SEE THE VICE-CHANCELLOR. FELLOWS, YOU CAN'T DO THIS. IT'S A MATTER OF LIFE AND DEATH. IF YOU'RE NOT THERE TOMORROW, I'LL BE SENT DOWN, AND THEN MY UNCLE WON' TAKE ME INTO THE FIRM. AND THEN MY FAMILY WILL SEND ME BACK TO THAT SHEEP RANCH IN NEW ZEALAND. AND WHEN I ARRIVE THERE, THEY'LL ALL BE WAITING FOR ME AND CALLING TO ME. WHO? THE SHEEP- THIRTY-FIVE THOUSAND DIRTY, SMELLY SHEEP. AND EVERY ONE OF THEM SAYING, "BABBS! BABBS!" WHAT'S SO FUNNY ABOUT THAT? WE WERE ONLY JOKING. DON'T WORRY, BABBS. WE WON' LET YOU DOWN. YOU BETTER NOT. THE LAST TIME I WAS RUSTICATED, MY FAMILY KEPT ME IN NEW ZEALAND FOR TWO YEARS. IF IT HAPPENS AGAIN, I'LL BE A SHEEPHERDER THE REST OF MY LIFE. SHEEPHERDER. COME IN! BEG PARDON, MILORD. I'VE JUST COME FROM MR. WIGGINS WITH YOUR COSTUME. IT'S READY TO TRY ON. I'LL DO IT RIGHT AWAY. NOW SEE HERE. YOU CAN START LAYING THE LUNCHEON TABLE AT ANY TIME, BRASSETT. YES, SIR. AND BRASSETT- - FETCH ME SIX-PENNY WORTH OF HAIRPINS. - HAIRPINS, MILORD? HAIRPINS. VERY GOOD, MILORD. TAKE IT OUT OF THAT HALF CROWN I GAVE YOU THIS MORNING. YES, MILORD. BEG PARDON, SIR. COME IN! DON'T SHOUT AT ME, SON. I'M BRINGING YOU YOUR ALLOWANCE. DAD! HOW ARE YOU, JACK? SPLENDID, SIR. CHARLEY, I WANT YOU TO MEET MY DAD. DAD, THIS IS CHARLEY WYKEHAM. HOW DO YOU DO, SIR FRANCIS? HELLO, WYKEHAM. WELL, I'LL RUN ALONG. I'LL BE IN MY ROOMS IF YOU WANT ME, JACK. GOOD-BYE, SIR FRANCIS. GOOD-BYE, WYKEHAM. I SAY, YOU ARE A HANDSOME DEVIL. NOT BAD FOR 51, EH? NO ONE WOULD EVER BELIEVE IT- GOOD-LOOKING, CHARMING, DEBONAIR. NO NEED GOING ON, JACK. YOUR CHECK'S ALREADY MADE OUT. YOU KNOW, DAD, I DON' SEE HALF ENOUGH OF YOU. I WISH I COULD AFFORD CIGARS LIKE THESE. WELL, CAN'T YOU? NO. NOW THAT I'VE COME INTO THE FAMILY TITLE, I HAVE ALSO COME INTO THE FAMILY DEBTS. DEBTS? MM. YOU KNOW - RED INK AND ALL THAT SORT OF THING. I'M AFRAID, JACK, FOR THE NEXT FEW YEARS... WE'RE GOING TO BE KNOWN AS CHARMING, EDUCATED, CULTURED PAUPERS. WELL. THAT RUINS ME WITH KITTY. HMM? WHAT'S THAT? OH, NOTHING, NOTHING. I- JUST THINKING ALOUD. THERE'S ONE RAY OF HOPE THOUGH. I- I THINK I HAVE AN APPOINTMEN FOR YOU IN NEW ZEALAND. NEW ZEALAND? MM-HMM. WONDERFUL PLACE. GREAT SHEEP-RAISING COUNTRY. YES. I'VE HEARD ALL ABOUT IT. SAY, DAD. I'VE AN IDEA. COULDN'T THIS ALL BE SETTLED BY A WEALTHY MARRIAGE? OH, NO. I RATHER DISLIKE THAT SORT OF THING, JACK. IF I WERE YOU- LISTEN. CHARLEY WYKEHAM'S AUNT, DONNA LUCIA D'ALVADOREZ, IS COMING HERE TO LUNCH TODAY. SHE'S A WEALTHY WIDOW- NO, DON'T DO IT, JACK. I WOULDN'T ADVISE YOUR MARRYING JUST FOR MONEY. BUT NOT ME, DAD. YOU. ME? OH, YOU YOUNG DEVIL. I'LL GET ALONG, SON. DON'T WORRY ABOUT ME. I WASN'T, SIR. I'M AFRAID I WAS BEING VERY SELFISH. WHAT? YOU SEE, DAD, I'M IN LOVE- FRIGHTFULLY, DEVASTATINGLY. BUT WITHOUT ANY MONEY, I HAVEN'T THE RIGHT. WHAT'S SHE LIKE? OH, SHE- SHE'S LIKE THE STARS, THE MOON AND THE SUN. IS SHE NOW? SOUNDS LIKE THE REAL THING. IT IS, SIR. I WAS GOING TO PROPOSE TO HER AT LUNCH TODAY, BUT- HOW ARE THE SHEEP IN NEW ZEALAND? PRETTY BAD. RATHER SMELLY TOO. WHAT'S THE MATTER, JACK? WON'T SHE WAIT? OH, I THINK SHE WOULD, SIR, BUT SHE HAS A GUARDIAN. OH. YOUR MOTHER AND I ELOPED UNDER SIMILAR CIRCUMSTANCES- BUT OF COURSE AT THE TIME I HAD A LITTLE INCOME. YES, AN INCOME CAN BE A WONDERFUL THING. IT CERTAINLY CAN. UH, HOW OLD IS THIS, UH, CHARLEY'S AUNT? OH, I DON'T KNOW. PROBABLY 90, LIKE MOST AUNTS. WELL, AT 90 THEY DON'T BOTHER YOU MUCH. AND YOU SAY SHE'S VERY WEALTHY? THEY SAY SHE HAS MILLIONS. I'M SURE YOUR MOTHER WOULD UNDERSTAND. HMM? WELL, I'LL HAVE LUNCHEON WITH YOU TODAY. OH, NO, DAD. I COULDN'T LET YOU DO ANYTHING LIKE THIS FOR ME. A LOVELESS MARRIAGE? BU I'M DOING IT FOR LOVE, SON. I THINK I'LL RUN ALONG AND GET SHAVED. NO MAN SHOULD PROPOSE ON A FULL BEARD. AFTER ALL, IT WOULD BE RATHER NICE TO HAVE THE STARS, THE SUN AND THE MOON FOR A DAUGHTER-IN-LAW. WHAT DID YOU SAY HER NAME WAS, JACK? KITTY. KITTY. THAT'S A LOVELY NAME, JACK. YES, SIR. IT IS. KITTY. THANK YOU. JACK? JACK! SHE'S NOT COMING. DON'T TELL ME THAT. BUT SHE MUST COME. WE'RE EXPECTING HER. SEND HER A WIRE. TELL HER - THERE'S NOT TIME ENOUGH.

KEEP YOUR DISTANCE. AND I MEAN IT. VERY WELL. YOU KNOW, CHARLEY, I'VE JUST BEEN THINKING. I DON'T REMEMBER SEEING BABBS TRIP ON THE STAIRS LAST NIGHT. COME TO THINK OF IT, I DON'T EITHER. AND IF WE DIDN'T SEE HIM, WE COULDN' VERY WELL TELL REDCLIFFE THAT WE DID. OH, OF COURSE NOT. THAT WOULD BE LYING. BUT YOU'VE GOT TO. HE'LL SEND ME DOWN IF YOU DON'T.

I STILL THINK IT WAS INEXCUSABLY BOORISH OF HIM. YOU DO, DO YOU? WELL, WHEN MY NEPHEW INTRODUCED ME TO HIM THIS AFTERNOON, I FOUND HIM TO BE A MAN OF GREAT CHARM, CULTURE, INTELLIGENCE, CHIVALRY, WIT, AFFECTION AND UNDERSTANDING. AS A MATTER OF FACT, I WAS NEVER QUITE SO IMPRESSED WITH ANYONE IN ALL MY LIFE. AND I'D RATHER NOT HEAR ANOTHER WORD AGAINST HIM! I SAY, DO YOU THINK WE'LL WIN FROM CAMBRIDGE AT CRICKET NEXT WEEK, CHARLEY, EH? OH, WE CAN'T LOSE, OLD BOY, WITH SPICKENS AT THE WICKET. SPICKENS IS A GOOD MAN. IT'S TOO BAD IT'S HIS LAST YEAR.

THIS IS ONE THAT DON PEDRO USED TO TELL. PERHAPS DONNA LUCIA WOULD PREFER TO TELL IT HERSELF. TOM PEDRO? DON PEDRO D'ALVADOREZ, YOUR LATE HUSBAND. OH, DON. DON PEDRO, OF COURSE. I KNEW HIS NAME. I CAN'T REMEMBER HIS STORIES. OH, PLEASE GO ON. I'M SURE DONNA LUCIA WON'T MIND. NO, NO, NO, NO. NOT AT ALL. IT SEEMS AS THOUGH DON PEDRO WAS WALKING THROUGH HIS COFFEE FIELDS ONE DAY... WHEN HE CAME ACROSS ONE OF HIS WORKMEN WHO WAS TIPSY. THE MAN HAD A GIRL IN HIS ARMS, AND HE WAS KISSING HER. OH. WELL, NATURALLY DON PEDRO WAS FURIOUS, AND HE SAID, "HOW DARE YOU?" AND THE MAN SAID, "WHAT'S THE MATTER? ALL YOUR WORKMEN DO THIS." AND DON PEDRO SAID, "HOW CAN YOU MAKE A STATEMENT LIKE THAT? WHAT GROUNDS DO YOU HAVE?" AND THE MAN SAID, "COFFEE GROUNDS." OH, WHAT A NAUGHTY STORY. SILLIEST THING I'VE EVER HEARD. DON'T YOU REMEMBER THE STORY, DONNA LUCIA? IT WAS ONE OF DON PEDRO'S FAVORITES. OH, PERFECTLY. I SHRIEKED THE FIRST TIME I HEARD IT. YOU KNOW, THAT REMINDS ME OF A VERY FUNNY STORY. ONE OF YOU GIRLS PLAY SOMETHING. WELL, NOW, GENTLEMEN, IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME, I'M GOING TO SHOW DONNA LUCIA THE GARDEN. YOU'VE NO IDEA HOW BEAUTIFUL IT IS IN THE MOONLIGHT. OH, DONNA LUCIA, WE ARE ALONE AT LAST. DON'T TOUCH ME! I'M VERY, VERY ANGRY WITH YOU. LUCIA, YOU WOUND ME. DON' SAY THAT. WELL, I DO SAY IT. AFTER THE WAY YOU PROMISED ME, TO TREAT ME LIKE THIS! PROMISE? YES, THE CONSEN YOU PROMISED ME IN WRITING. BUT I DIDN'T PROMISE. WHY, STEPHEN! TO THINK THA YOU'D GO BACK ON YOUR WORD. OH, DONNA LUCIA! THAT'LL DO YOU NO GOOD UNTIL I GET THE LETTER. BUT, MY DEAREST- STEPHEN, UNTIL YOU GIVE ME THA LETTER, ALL IS OVER BETWEEN US. NO. NO. WE CAN NEVER BE APART. THERE IS SOME UNSEEN SOMETHING THAT BINDS US TOGETHER. WELL, MAYBE YOU'RE RIGHT. JUS THE SAME, I WANT THAT LETTER. VERY WELL, DEAR. I'LL GO TO MY STUDY AND WRITE IT. BUT THEN - THEN WILL YOU SAY THAT YOU'LL BE MINE? I'LL SAY ANYTHING YOU LIKE WHEN I GET THE LETTER. DARLING! OH! IF YOU LOOK, YOU'RE NO GENTLEMAN! NOW YOU MAY HELP ME UP. OH, A THOUSAND PARDONS, DEAREST LUCIA. TELL ME, DID YOU HURT YOUR BACK? MY BACK IS FINE. NOW, GO WRITE THE LETTER. I WON'T BE A MOMENT. DARLING! ARE YOU ALONE? MAY I SIT DOWN, PLEASE? MY, WHAT A DREADFUL SMELL OF SMOKE THERE IS IN HERE! YES, I NOTICED IT MYSELF. MUST BE SOMETHING BURNING IN THE KITCHEN. I'LL GO SEE WHAT IT IS. NO, DON'T GO. I WANT TO TALK TO YOU ABOU YOUR LATE HUSBAND, DON PEDRO. OH, LET'S NOT TALK ABOUT HIM. HE WAS SUCH A CRUEL HUSBAND. THE DON PEDRO I KNEW WAS SO KIND. OH, THAT'S HIS FATHER, THEOLDPEDRO, THE ONE WITH THE BEARD. OH. OH, FORGIVE MY CURIOSITY, BUT HAVE YOU ANY CHILDREN? CHILDREN? ONLY A FEW. NONE TO SPEAK OF. OH, DONNA LUCIA, I'M SURPRISED THAT YOU HAVEN'T ACQUIRED THE HABIT OF SMOKING. SO MANY BRAZILIAN WOMEN HAVE, YOU KNOW. WELL, CONFIDENTIALLY, I WAS JUS PUFFING ON A PERFECTO WHEN YOU CAME IN. I THOUGHT YOU MIGH NOT UNDERSTAND, SO I, UH- WOULD YOU CARE FOR ONE? THEY'RE VERY MILD, YOU KNOW. OH, NO. NO, THANK YOU. WELL, YOU- YOU DON' KNOW WHAT YOU'RE MISSING. - OH, LORD BABBERLY? YES? OH, IS HE HERE TOO? OH, IT'S NO USE. LORD BABBERLY, I'VE KNOWN WHO YOU WERE FOR HOURS. OH, MY GOODNESS. YOU WON' GIVE ME AWAY, WILL YOU? THAT ALL DEPENDS. BUT THIS WASN' MY IDEA. YOU MUST BELIEVE ME. THIS WHOLE THING STARTED WITH SHEEP. I MEAN, WHEN JACK AND CHARLEY INVITED THE GIRLS TO LUNCHEON. OH, IT'S SUCH A LONG STORY. CAN'T WE GO SOMEPLACE WHERE WE WON'T BE INTERRUPTED? OH, OF COURSE. PARDON ME. LADIES FIRST. SO JACK LOVES KITTY, AND AMY LOVES CHARLEY, AND I'M PLAYING CUPID IN THREE PETTICOATS, AND THAT'S THE WHOLE STORY. MAYBE YOU'RE NOT DOING THEM AS GREAT A FAVOR AS YOU THINK. I'M GETTING THEM A LETTER OF CONSENT. WHAT MORE DO THEY WANT? PERHAPS THIS LETTER OF CONSENT IS MERELY A PRETENSE. AFTER ALL, MR. SPETTIGUE IS OBVIOUSLY A FORTUNE HUNTER. PERHAPS THE GIRLS ARE AFTER MONEY TOO. WELL, THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE. MR. SPETTIGUE WAS AGAINST THE MARRIAGES. OH! OH, HE WAS? OF COURSE. THE MOMENT LOVE FLIES IN THE WINDOW, HIS INCOME FLIES OUT. THE ONLY REASON HE'S CONSENTING IS BECAUSE HE THINKS HE'S GONNA MAKE MORE MONEY BY MARRYING ME. OH, PLEASE DON'T DO THAT. I HAVE OTHER PLANS FOR YOU. YOU HAVE? YES. WHEN YOU JOIN YOUR UNCLE'S FIRM IN THE FALL, I SHALL INSIST THAT YOU HANDLE MY AFFAIRS. WELL- WELL. IN ALL DEFERENCE TO YOUR UNCLE, I THINK IT MIGHT BE RATHER FUN... TO HAVE AN ATTORNEY WHO THOUGH SOMETHING MORE OF LOVE'S YOUNG DREAM... THAN JUST A- A FUTURE ALIMONY CASE. DO YOU SOLEMNLY PROMISE TO BE MY FIRST CLIENT? I DO. WELL, TELL ME, DO YOU BELIEVE IN LOVE AT FIRST CLIENT? OH, YOU DO? I DO. DONNA LUCIA! DONNA LUCIA! DO YOU REALLY MEAN IT? BUT OF COURSE I DO, YOU SILLY BOY. WHY, I HEARD SOMETHING. IT'S MY HEART.
