She's just shy. I brought you some tea. Look! Here they come. Come on, they're coming! Shh. We're getting ready to set the table. Take these checkers someplace else. Here, you take these. Come on, Henry, be careful. Come on. - Oh, man, you always drop the checkers when I'm... - That's the way you win! Toto! Toto!

No automobiles are to be driven without snow tires or chains. Winds up to 45 miles per hour... That was a great dinner, Emma. - That baby! - You're a grandpa! - Our daughter's fine. - Mmm. But Dorothy. Give her time, honey. Give her time. Those dishes ain't gonna wash themselves. Mrs. Warren's son looks real fine, don't he? Aunt Em, please, no more matchmaking. Did you make the decision about that new school yet? It's no decision to make. But, honey, it's a chance to teach in high school. Get away from that kindergarten once and for all. It's more money. But besides the money, it's a chance for you to be with older students. Almost adults. - I like it with the kids, Aunt Em. - I know you do, honey. And you're a fine teacher. But that's why I think you'd enjoy teachin' high school. Have a chance to be with the students for four years... ...such an important time in their development. I'm really happy with the kids, Aunt Em. But you been there for three years already. It's time you got out of that sandbox and into some new people, new neighborhood. Girl, do you know you're Never been south of 125th Street? Well, you haven't. Oh, here we go again. You get me so worked up... ...that I'm beginning to sound like a Jewish mother. I can't see how goin' south of 125th Street ever made anybody's life better. And you're never gonna know unless you try, are you? And you're never gonna know unless you try, are you? Come on, Aunt Em, let me do that. Why don't you go in and relax? I can do... Let me do that. Listen, I know gettin' out in that world ain't easy... ...leaving Uncle Henry and me. But we'll always be here for ya, Dorothy. And whatever your fears are, well... ...they'll be defeated just by facing up to 'em. Now, you take that new job and find a place for you and Toto. It's time for you to make a home of your own. Toto! Oh! Toto! Toto! Toto! Toto! Toto! Oh! Toto! Toto! Toto! Toto! Toto! Toto! # La, la, la, la, la # # La, la, la, la # Toto! Where are you? Toto! Toto! Toto! Toto! Oh! Toto, Toto. - Toto, Toto. - To... To... Toto! - Toto, Toto. Toto, Toto. - To... To... To... - Toto! - Toto! - Toto! - Toto! - Toto! - Toto! God, where am I? Toto! Toto! Toto! Toto! Two, two, two, two, two, two, two, two! Two, four, six, eight! Who do we appreciate? No! No! - Relax, Mama! - We just wanna lay a little thanks on ya. - What? - You know, heavy on the gratitude department. - Gratitude? For what? - For curling the curse. - For leveling the leech. - For killing our oppressor. Uh! I never killed nothin' in my life. - Never killed the point? - A pint? - A good story? - The umpire? - No! - Never killed no time? No, I told you! I never killed nothin'! Well, then, I think you graduated... ...from the bush leagues into the majors, girl. Toto? Can you dig this? - Who is it? - Ain't no more "is"! Thanks to you, it's a "was"! - She was Evermean. - The Wicked Witch from the East. And they didn't call her Evermean for nothin'! She was the parks department commissioner! Caught us paintin' on her playground walls. - Turned us into graffiti! - And there we stayed. - Flat, splat and stuck like that! - Doomed as cartoons forever. 'Til you burned alphabet through the sky and ended the curse. - And the "curseress. " - Givin' a new lease on life to us... The Munchkins, most recently referred to as the "cursees. " Toto. Let's hear it for Super Witch and her Wonder Dog! Two, four, six, eight! Who do we appreciate? Miss One! Come to Mama, you hot little digits! Let me lay my 20-20s on ya! Oh, how I love you! Let me... Mmm! Count the ways! Oh, mmm! Mmm! Innumerable blessings, countless felicitations. Thank you beyond number and additional good stuff! I didn't mean to... I didn't mean to kill her. Oh, don't be all sixes and sevens, honey. You did the world a multitudinous service by 86ing ol' Evermean. Bottom line, honey, this chick put the "ugh" in ugly. But she sure had pretty shoes, didn't she? Yah! I don't want these shoes. I wanna go home. I wouldn't discount those shoes, honey. And don't ever take 'em off until you do get home. Remember Miss One told ya. Oh, pardon me. Miss One's the name if you haven't guessed by now. Numbers is my game and now that you've freed us... we can all go back to runnin' our business, ahem. We can all go back to runnin' our business. We can all go back to runnin' our business. But where am I? Where am I? You're in Munchkin Land! - The indivisible Land of Oz! - Oz? But where's my home? Where's Aunt Em? Where's New York? - New York? - 433 Prospect Place. Ooh! Four, three, three. You wanna play more than one number today, honey? I got a freedom special, three numbers for the price... No, I don't wanna play any numbers. I just wanna get home! Oh, well, now that ol' Evermean's number's up... ...that leaves only three witches in Oz. One, myself, but my powers don't amount to much. And number two, Glinda, the Good Witch of the South. Oh, she's a real star, but you can hardly catch her in. And number three, the multi-horrored Evillene, the Wicked Witch of the West. Evermean's even uglier sister! But I don't think it'd be a good time to ask her for a favor. So I figured the odds are only the Wiz could cipher how to get you back to... So I figured the odds are only the Wiz could cipher how to get you back to... - Where'd you say that place was? - The Wiz? What's a Wiz? What's a... What's a Wiz? Oh, darlin', he's the ultimate. The "X" quotient, the new math. The common denominator, the main man. The head honcho! Bottom line, honey. Numero uno! - Where is he? How do I find him? - Catch this number, honey. # Sweet thing let me tell you about # # The world and the way things are now # # You've come from a different place # # And I know you've traveled far # # Now that you've told me what it is # # I better point you towards the Wiz # - # He's the Wiz # - # He's the man He's the only one # # Who can give your wish right to ya # # He'll send you back through time # # By runnin' magic through ya # # All of his super power's his # # Dot dot da dot da # # Listen and I'll tell you where he is # # He's the Wiz and he lives # # In Oz # - # He's the Wizard # - # There's the way # # To the Emerald City That's not too far, is it # - # He's the Wizard # - # Just take your dilemma, child # # And lay it on the Wizard # # He'll fix you a drink that'll bubble and foam # # Dot dot da dot da # # And in a flash you will be home # - # He's the Wiz # - # He's the Wiz He's the Wizard of Oz # - # He's got magic up his sleeve # - # He's the Wizard # # And you know without his help # # It would be impossible to leave # # Fantastic powers at his command # Whoo! # And I'm sure that he will understand # # He's the Wiz and he lives # # In Oz # # Sweet thing, let me tell you about # # The world and the way things are now # # And I'd better point ya towards the Wiz # Whee!

Count your blessings, cut your losses and follow the Yellow Brick Road. - The Yellow Brick Road? Yeah! The Yellow Brick Road! Yellow Brick. Toto! Remember, don't ever take those shoes off and watch out for the poison poppies! Wait. Miss One? Miss One? Miss One!

Mister, please wait! Ha, ha, ha, ha! Succulent and divine! - Delicious and nutritious. - Brother crows, this is good stuff! I'm glad you fellows are enjoying your breakfast. Is today the day you're gonna help me get down from here? Help you down? What is goin' down in that hayloft you call a head? Didn't we tell you yesterday and the day before that... - And the day before that... - That you can't get down? This is your life, buddy, all hung up! Besides, Clyde... ...us crows are just thinkin' of you. There ain't nothin' to get down for! But I was just thinkin', just once, fellas... ...for a little while to walk in my garden, wouldn't that be terrific? - Walk! - You can't walk! Why, you just a straw paper dummy! You're right, fellas. I was just bein' selfish. And stupid as usual! - But I was readin' this morning that most people... - Oh, man! Look, didn't we tell you readin' was a waste of time? - But Bacon here said... - Bacon? Once over lightly, please! "Knowledge is power. " - See, and, uh, Cicero, he said... - Cicero-ro-row! "More men are ennobled by study than by nature. " And over here, especially apropos in my situation... ...i. E., stuck up on this here pole: "Do not accept any situation. Question, argue and explore. " Now who you gonna believe? - Mr. Nobody on that paper? - Fellas, please! Or your good friends, the crows? Yeah, who have dedicated their lives to educatin' you. - Yeah! - Sounds to me, fellas... ...like ol' garbage guts here done forgot the crow commandments again. Fellas, I did not forget the crow commandments. Please! Run 'em by me! Run 'em by me. - Thou shalt honor all crows. - Right on! - Proceed! - Thou shalt stop readin' all bits of paper and literature. - Trash! Trash! - And the most important one! Thou shalt never, never get down off of this here pole! You got it, Clyde! And the crow anthem!

You will? What's she doing here? - Get her outta here. - Shoo! Shoo! Shoo! Shoo, shoo, go on about your business. Shoo! Ooh! - Just hold on. - This is just an experiment. The results of the first experiment: Subject is a hopeless failure. - You are not. - I am. You're just a product of some negative thinking. First thing we have to do is get rid of these crows. Come on, Toto, sic 'em! Shoo! Shoo! Shoo! Before I call the taxidermist, you turkeys! Get off me, dog! Good boy, Toto. We can go now. You okay? Come on! Hey! Ooh! I think I'm gonna make it this time. You sure are. Just a little self-confidence... ...and coordination. You're gonna be fine. You mean, all this time the only thing standing between... ...hangin' up there and livin' it up down here... were those crows? Well, they told you you couldn't do it and you believed them. If I only had a brain, I would have figured that out a long time ago. There you go with that negative thinkin' again. - Everybody has a brain. - Uh-uh. Not me, look. Oh. Garbage? "Lgnorance is the night of the mind... ...a night without moon or star. " Confucius said that. I'm on my way to find the Wiz. He's gonna get me back home. That's nice. Thank you. Good luck. I thought maybe he could get you a brain. You think that he could... And Toto and me, we could sure use some company. Besides, you have nothin' to lose. I don't, do I? That was so smart of you! I wish I thought of that. Indications are it would be very advantageous for me to join you. Good. Um, we only have one problem. The Munchkins said to follow the Yellow Brick Road, but I haven't been able to find it. - Yellow Brick Road? - There it is! Hey, wait! Wait! Did you say, "Yellow Brick Road"? - Yes! - Look over here! We don't need no cabs. - Say, what's your name? - My name is... Dorothy. Dorothy and Toto? What intelligent names! Okay, Dorothy and Toto, we're gonna have to find our own Yellow Brick Road. # Ease on down Ease on dow... # - Down the road! - There it is! # Ease on down # - Oh! - # Ease on...

Can you give me a hand? Dorothy? Oh, how terrible. - Don't move. - Don't worry, I wasn't planning any promenades. We'll be right back. Oh, he's so brave. He's probably in shock. Oh, what I wouldn't give to be in shock... Just once. I'm so... I'm so sorry. No apology necessary. I told you nothing hurts me. I have no feelings. The genius who created me only took care of my dashing good looks... ...my razor sharp wit and my irresistible attraction to the wrong women. What he forgot to add... was a heart. But... Everyone has a heart. Alas, everyone but yours truly. Hello! Nobody home in Soulville. Rid of you! Free from your posterior prison! You hulking she devil! Don't hear ya laughing now. We were abandoned here when this park went "el foldo. " Ah, it was a sad day. There's not much amusement to the closing down of an amusement park. But yours truly is an old trooper! I quickly made plans for the future. But alas, I was felled by my 4th wife, Teenie. Crushed in my prime! There, how does that feel? But that's the whole tragic point, my friends. # What would I do # # If I could suddenly feel # # And to know once again # # That what I feel is real # # I could cry I could smile # # I might lay back for a while # - # Tell me what # - # What # # What would I do # # If I could feel # # What would I do # # If I could reach inside of me # # And to know how it feels to say # # I like what I see # # And I'd be more # # Than glad to share # # All that I have inside of here # # And the songs my heart might bring # # You'd be more than glad to sing # # And if tears should fall from my eyes # # Just think of all the wounds they could mend # # And just think of all the time I could spend # # Just being vulnerable again # - # Tell me what # - # What # # What would I do # - # Oh, tell me what # - # What, what would I do # - # Oh, tell me what # - # What # # What would I do # # If I could feel ## I'm just a miserable hunk of junk.

Could I come with ya? - Of course. - "A threefold cord is not quickly broken. " What's wrong? He rusted himself cryin'. Oil! Oil! - What? - Oil! - Find some oil! - Some oil!

Send up the one with the silver slippers. Do you know how lucky you are? I've been trying to get an appointment for two years! No one sees the Wiz! - I knew you'd make it. - Who does your hair? Can you come for dinner next Wednesday? - Can I give you my card? - Can I take you home? And... Only the one with the silver slippers! You go ahead, Dorothy. "He who hesitates... " Etcetera, etcetera. Uh, I'd like to speak to the Wiz. Hey, Mike! Excuse me... Excuse me, sir, Mr. Wiz? Speak! I'm not alone, sir. I'm here with my three companions and my dog, Toto. Forget it. No riffraff. Uh, they're not riffraff, sir. They're my friends and they've traveled far to see you. I said, forget it! Then, then, I'm not comin' up there. What? Either you see my friends, sir, or you forget it. Send up the riffraff. What's happening? Step forward. Sure wish I was back at the library. So! You wanted to meet the Wizard! What do you snivelling deadbeats want? That's close enough! My name is Dorothy and... And I'm, I'm tryin' to get home. And these, these are my friends. This is the Scarecrow. He, he wants... Tell him. A brain, Your Majesty. Some of your great "Wiz... Dom. " Uh, and this is the Tin Man. I been a two-bit, carny hustler all my life. And I want a heart, O mighty and powerful Wiz. A heart... So I can love... ...all humanity. And what do you want, you overstuffed animal cracker? I wanna get the hell outta here! He wants some courage, sir. So he can go back to his old job... of being king of the jungle. Is this so, Lion? Anything she says. Can you help us, sir? - What's in it for me? - We'd be very grateful. How about your pretty silver slippers? No! No! You dare say no... ...to the great Wizard of Oz? I, I can't take these off 'til I get back home, but I'll send 'em to you. The great Oz has decided... ...not to grant any of your wishes! Unless, unless... ...you, Dorothy, kill Evillene... ...the Wicked Witch of the West! The great Oz has spoken! Oh, Mr. Wiz, please! Come in. I'm sorry I dragged you all here. And look how it turned out. Have you made your decision yet, Dorothy? I don't think there's any choice. Dorothy, you don't have to do it! We could stay right here! The Emerald City's not a bad place. Get a small apartment, chip in together. Hey, I bet in no time we'd fit right in. But I could never be happy here. Besides, I'd... Never get home. I have to go all the way, even if it means to Evillene. Come on, Toto, good boy. Then I'm going with you. Likewise! Me too. Come on. Which road do we take? Road? This one... ...and you may be sorry. - Then how do we find Evillene? - Don't worry. She'll find you.

Don't worry, Dorothy. It doesn't hurt. It's just a little rough on my filing system. Never fear, my little flower. I'm just a hollow shell! Don't give up the shoes!

Hello? - Where are we? - This must be the back door. I don't think the killers of the Wicked Witch of the West... ...should be using the back door. You know what I mean? Cheetah says it's a shortcut. - Good-bye, Cheetah. - Good-bye, Dorothy. Bye. Whew! It's open. Hello? Hello in there! Wait! - Wait a minute. - Does this look familiar? Guess who got had? Barnum said there's a sucker born every minute. I was there when he said it... ...but I never thought I'd be one of 'em. Phony! You're nothing but a phony! The Wizard's out! He's not here! Lies! No more lies. You charlatan! I've seen men shot for less. - You're a terrible man! - I'm sorry! - Sorry? - I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry! Phony! Everything they say about me is true. I'm a phony! I got no right to be pretending to be the Wiz! I've got nothin'. Hocus-pocus. I'm just plain old Herman Smith from Atlantic City. Atlantic City? Atlantic City? You mean, you're from New Jersey? Mm-hmm. I'm just a second-rate politician from District Seven. "Public office is the last refuge of the incompetent. " Penrose! Incompetent? Ha-ha-ha! That's me. I'm incompetent. So much so, I could never get elected to public office. Not because I didn't try. I tried everything. Look, look! I ran for everything. Alderman, councilman, assembly leader! I became a laughingstock. I couldn't even get on the ticket! Finally, in desperation, I ran for dogcatcher! I like animals. Don't get me wrong. I was at the end of my rope. I plunged myself into the campaign. One desperate grandstand play. You know what I did? I rented a hot-air balloon! Hot air! That's a perfect vehicle for you. No, no, no! It was a beautiful Fourth of July day! I planned to fly over the boardwalk and the beach... ...and throw my... Aaah! Throw my leaflets to the astonished crowds below. My motto was... "Vote for Smith, your best bet to catch that pet. " But just when I got up in the balloon... A terrible storm came up... ...and blew me into the clouds. I got lost. I landed here in Oz. They'd never seen a hot-air balloon like mine before. And I know I should have told them the truth... ...but they proclaimed me the Wizard... ...and I needed the job. And you mean... ...you sent us to kill Evillene... ...knowing... we might never come back? She would've killed me. She would've found out I had no power, and took over Oz. That's no excuse. Come on. Please, please don't go. I live... I live here all alone... ...in terror... ...that someone will find out... ...that I'm a fraud. Please... ...just stay with me for a little while and talk. You can talk to me crazy... ...call me names. What's the matter? Now I'll never get my brain. Nor my heart. Or my courage. But you don't need them now... ...because you've had them all along. Scarecrow. Scarecrow? You're the one who figured out how to find the Yellow Brick Road... ...and how to destroy Evillene... ...and every smart move we've made. Didn't you? Didn't you? And, Lion... ...you wouldn't even give up when Evillene strung you up by your tail. And, Tin Man... ...you have more heart than anyone I've ever known. Honest? Yes. You never needed anything from the fake Wizard anyway. # If you believe # # Within your heart you'll know # # That no one can change # # The path that you must go # # Believe what you feel # # And know you're right because # # The time will come around # # When you say it's yours # # Believe there's a reason to be # # Believe you can make time stand still # # You know from the moment you try # # If you believe # # I know you will # # Believe in yourself # # Right from the start # # You'll have brains # # You'll have a heart # # You'll have courage # # To last your whole life through # # If you believe in yourself # # If you believe in yourself # # If you believe in yourself # # As I believe in you ## What about you, Dorothy?

Dorothy, you were wise and good enough... ...to help your friends find what was inside them all the time. That's true for you, also. Home? Inside me? I don't understand. Home is a place we all must find, child. It's not just a place where you eat or sleep. Home is knowing. Knowing your mind, knowing your heart... ...knowing your courage.

Uh-huh. Dorothy. Can you do something for me? They've had what they've been searching for in them all along. I don't know what's in you. You'll have to find that out for yourself. But I do know one thing. You'll never find it in the safety of this room. I tried that all my life. It doesn't work. There's a whole world out there. And you'll have to begin... ...by letting people see who you really are. Success... ...fame and fortune... ...they're all illusions. All there is that is real... ...is the friendship... ...that two can share. That's beautiful. Who said that? I did. Oh, Dorothy. I'll think of you all the time. And I will miss you... ...every day. Even if I had to go back to that junk pile... ...even as Teenie's seat cushion, I wouldn't mind... ...because I have known real love. Oh, don't rust yourself, now. Oh, Dorothy. If it hadn't been for you... I'd still be back on that pedestal... ...afraid to live. Me, too. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you for being my friends. Thank you for being my friends. I'm ready now.
