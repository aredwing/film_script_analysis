Did you not all get sleep? Edukondalu, Do not poke your nose in our matter. Go away from here. Whenever I say something. It is for the welfare of the village. Stop this stupid act and go to bed. Do not listen to him. Light it. If I say once, Will you not listen to me? They have accepted their fault, what shall we do now? What else can we do? Ask them to promise that they Will not do such things again. We accept to have planted a bomb in factory but we Do not accept it as a wrong. Is not it wrong to blast the factory? - Absolutely not. Waste of Factory is getting mixed up in our lake. And our farmlands are getting ruined. Children are falling sick. The health of old people is deteriorating, That is why, we wanted to blow up the factory. Will our problems be solved if we blow up the factory? Do not talk stupidly. It is a chemical factory and not an ordinary factory. If it had blown it, gas will envelop our village and burn it down Those who survived they would have been caught by the police And beaten to pulp behind the bars. Getting angry is not enough. You must put some sense into it. We never thought about those issues We wanted to destroy the factory before it destroys our village. What they did is right who is that? - Mangathayaru She pokes her nose into everything. They are absolutely right. Factory is a huge loss to our village We had complained to MRO, RDO and the Collector many a times We had given many petitions. Did anything happen? You are also right. - I am always correct. Edukondalu stopped them unnecessarily and committed a crime by stopping them. He must ask for forgiveness from them. Oh my god! you have turned the total story on me. What else did you think about this Mangathayaru, Inter? To hell with your Inter! Uncle, why are you backing her just because she spoke in English What she says is also right? We had given so many petitions but nothing happened? To give orders as soon as we give petitions They are working under a Government and not under us. Government pays their salaries and not us Oh I see. Will there be people to work under us? Yes, there are. That is Government! Government is for the people, by the people, of the people. Did not they teach this in your school? I know. But why should Government listen to us? Are we paying their salaries? We caste our votes which is more valuable Our village M.L.A. Bairagi Naidu has now become the Minister. We will go and ask him to close the factory, that is all. - What will happen? You are absolutely right. - Yes, you are right. When I say something. It will be for the welfare of the village. Got it. Since you have given the idea, you go to Hyderabad and solve the problem. This Panchayat will bear all the expenses. - Yes Hyderabad and Me?

Anyone who wears a black coat is not a lawyer. He is a T.C. - Oh TC! What does that mean? Ticket Collector Hey Edukondalu... - Yes Is there any relation between a District Collector and a Ticket Collector? Yes, there is. If the district collector makes any mistake Government will make him ticket collector. If ticket collector commits any mistake Government will make him a Bill Collector. - I see. If bill Collector.... - He will not commit any mistake. Wow! You know more than what my grand daughter knows. What did you think about me? If she has passed Inter, I am a practical street smart guy.

Oh no! - I saw murder of Adhiseshu. Who killed him? Swarna - Swarna! - Yes sir. They did not see me or else they would have killed me also. Then, why did you not inform this to police station immediately? I was in a shock since then. I came to tell you first. Oh my god! Shall I lodge a complaint now? You have committed a grave mistake. I would have come if you had called me. Why did you come here all of a sudden? To tell that there is not much difference between you and them. Colour should not know the change of a chameleon or knife about the murder. Since you do not even have this knowledge. it is my mistake to give you a job. One man saw you murdering Adhiseshu. Thank god, he came to me and told that. If he had gone to police, we would have spent our lives in jail. I had to commit another murder to cover up yours. That is why, this time I Will not pay money for the murder you had committed. I will give you an M. L. A. seat. Father of Adhiseshu has a good name in our constituency. If Adhiseshu had contested, he would have easily won. But, what is the use? Just like his father; he will follow the path of honesty and injustice. He will neither live nor let us live. That is why, I had removed him, and making you to contest. A Dummy candidate will stand on behalf of our party. Our party workers will work for you. After winning, you will join our party.

I know the people who created trouble here. They are none other than... - Shut your mouth and come with me. When a girl is brave enough to tell the truth. Why are you taking her away? Remove pant shirt and wear a sari like a woman Hey, what are you looking? what is the meaning of it? Coward! Get lost from here. Did not have courage to tell the truth. But giving me stares? Why should we be afraid to tell the truth? Those rogues were going berserk. Should we keep quiet? If I had told the truth to C. I. He would have put everyone behind the bars. Shut up and come inside Everyone is leaving it casually without bothering about it. That is why, these anti-social elements are having a field day Why are you so afraid of them?

Go carefully. Edukondalu, come quickly. Go away. Greetings sir Come... come... Edukondalu, it seems you were going away. He said you were tensed... - It is all part of my life. This work is not more important than your work. Look, factory file is on my table. Take it as your work is over. It is all your grace. Why are you still standing? Please sit down. No problem. - Come, sit. What would you like to have? - No need of anything sir. Okay, at least you have a glass of water My village is waiting to drink clean water like this. What is the problem? No more problem. The problem was this factory only. Not that, the problem at polling station That is Manga the girl who came with me, you too had met her once. Some rogues misbehaved with her, I got angry and beat them up black and blue. Why do you want to invite trouble? I too kept quite once or twice like you earlier. But those rogues barged into the polling station Casting bogus votes they beat anyone who tried to stop them. So, I beat and handed them over to police. You too must punish them. I will take care of them, but first you must do one thing. Tell me sir, what do you want me to do? Nothing, you must withdraw your complaint. I am asking, you to withdraw the complaint. Put your thumb impression on it. Why are asking me to do this? They are bad people. They should not be released. They are all my people. That is why, I am asking you to withdraw the complaint This is injustice sir. Why are backing such bad people? Yes, they are more important to me. Who are you to ask me? Are not we the voters who made you a Minister? I need them more than your bloody vote once in five years. They are ready to do anything for me. They will kill people, create trouble Burn down buses ensure closure of business. Can you do it for me? Even if you forget me after casting your vote. I will never forget you all my life, madam. We trusted you and voted for you 4 times. If you do not like ... Do not vote for me. If I do not get a Bobbarlanka, I will contest from Bobbili. If I do not get a seat in East Godavari, I will contest from West Godavari. I can contest from any one of 294 constituencies of Andhra Pradesh. And win using of my money power, bloody idiot... That is my money power. Why should I tell you all this? First put your thumb impression. Will you not? Your village? Your people? Before our village is completely devastated, you must save it. Everyone in village has his hopes on you. Complete your mission and come back. Future of our village, everyone hopes are on you. Make him to put his thumb impression on this. Put it. Open his finger. What are you compared to my money, power and fame? You are just an insect on cow dung. Take his thumb impression and kill him. No one must find his body also. Why are you all hurt? What happened? Henchman of Swarna came for Edukondalu. They beat us all up. When they threatened to kill uncle He told them you had gone to house of Bairagi. Thank god, you have come back safely Where is Edukondalu? Bairagi Naidu supports Swarna, they may harm him for election trouble. ''BATTULA BAIRAGI NAIDU, Industries and Pollution Minister. Open the door, please. - Who is that in this heavy rain? What is it? - There is a man named Edukondalu inside. There is no one inside. - Enquire with Minister. Can you not understand if I say once? Go away. No... Not that... You have given us a lot of trouble. You could have gone away silently. Why did you cross path with us? I am Manga, has Edukondalu come back? - Not yet. Where did you go?

For safer side, I will lodge a complaint with Police. I am calling from Devi Nursing home. - Go ahead. A man with your descriptions has come on the verge of death He died on arrival body is in the mortuary. Will you come now? Why is everyone returning like that? - Stop for a moment. They are not party workers, henchmen of Swarna. An eye witness has given this complaint about their atrocities. The same person has given me a complaint you had forced him. Look at this. What is your reply? There is something fishy in this. All this is quite common in our Department. Release them immediately. Call the complainant, you will know the truth. He will not come. How can he come? He is shivering with fear for his tortures. He came to me told everything and left for his village giving this. Poor man belongs to my home village. I told to be brave and sent him. Do not trust him, sir. Mr. Venkateshwara Rao, mind your words and the place you are. First release them and then try to arrest the real culprits They are the real culprits. I have been trying to catch them since a long time. Now, I have evidence against them. That is it, sir! He is using department to settle personal scores. Can you not understand an order from DGP to release them? Are you mad? - Hey, who is mad? Will you call me mad? Bloody bastard, I will kill you. Who is mad man? Will you call me a mad man? They are party workers and you are a Minister. Leave me, I will kill you. Leave me. Sir I think he has really gone mad. First send him to a hospital. Calm down, grandma Doctors have said Edukondalu is safe, have not they? Manga and grandma will stay here along with Edukondalu. If anyone asks about them, say they have gone back to village. You too do not come here unless it is very important. It is too dangerous if they see you. Okay, Swapna I have only love for you, nothing else. I love you since my childhood days. I tried many times to express my love for you. But, I felt shy so, I could you not express it. Really! Look at my madness. I am hallucinating as if you are talking to me.

I know everything will become sand. I know everything is just an illusion. After knowing and then getting distressed for it is... Hail Lord Venkat Ramana! Oh! You have come. Did you tell the Lord to save my Swapna? Why did you not shave your head after going there? I have vowed. Only when my sister-in-law gets cured from cancer, I will shave my head. He will get her cured from cancer at least for my hair. How intelligent you are? Did you get a good view of god? Oh! What a crowd? - Is it? But I had a very good 'dharsan'. Take the offerings from God. Hail Lord Venkat Ramana! He has packed 'Jilebi' instead of 'Laddu' because of power failure. What is this? Tirupati is famous for Laddu. Why have you brought 'Jilebi'? Do you not know the news? - What news? Now, 'Jilebi' is offered in Tirupati and not 'Laddu'. This was changed recently. - But why? How can you ask that question? If it is 'Laddu', it must be so big. They do not have that much funds. So, Chandra Babu Naidu has ordered to offer 'Jilebi' Did Chandra Babu Naidu pass this order? He must be right. I am stinking. I will go and take a bath. - Is it? Then go, my dear. This is Lord Venkateshwara offerings. Pray and eat. Why are you looking so dull now a days? How can I be happy after knowing you have cancer? What? Cancer me? No, do not try to hide it. I heard everything you told Mallesh. You can act that you are happy though you have such a dreadful disease. But I cannot. - Have you gone mad? Cancer for me? I told him that my Zodiac sign is cancer. It means 'Karkataka' in Telugu language. Shit! Brother! - Yes, younger brother come. So you have come. - Brother! Is this a new dress? - Yes. Brother! - Yes, younger brother. I met an elderly man in Tirupati. There is a temple of Lord Vinayaka in Singapore. It seems it is very powerful. - Is it? If you give me just Rs. 50,000 I will go to Singapore and pray for my sister-in-law. What will you pray for? To get sister-in-law cured from cancer Will you not pray for my mental illness to get cured? Brother, what happened to you? I mistook Zodiac sign cancer as disease cancer. You fooled me and went to Tirupati. And moreover, you brought a bad repute to Chandra Babu Naidu. So, I committed a mistake. How dare you change my bracelet and ring into these things? Hey, now you have planned for a world tour. Sorry, I made a mistake. I will never do it again. You mean you will cheat me in a different way. What is this? God offerings from Tirupati Open your mouth. Will you not open your mouth? Eat it... eat it. Edukondalu, hope you all are fine there. But, nothing is fine here. After you went there, the situation here has deteriorated. We are not able to drink the water in the lake. We do not have water to drink. We are taking water from the villager nearby. Your uncle Venkateshwara has been paralyzed. Entire village is eagerly waiting for your arrival. Complete the job successfully and come back soon with good news. Pollution control board of Delhi will send a report to the, Hyderabad state pollution control board. They will in turn will send a copy of it to the Minister. What is it? Has your job not completed? - It will not. You will get tired of coming here, but your job will not get completed. What are you doing here after office hours? This mad fellow has no other job. Mad fellow! Yes, he was an officer in this office before. Go away. Sir, were you working in this office? Not now But, office is mine, files and chairs are mine. I will give anything you want. Anything I want? How much do you have in your pocket? Sister, I knew the address of that T.V. girl. - Really? Some one has boarded in the first floor. It is still going up. Why has it stopped in between? Magic current! It has gone all of a sudden. Where is Edukondalu? Not only in Bobbarlanka, there are 5 such factories in Andhra Pradesh. What comes out from them is not waste but poison. All rivers on earth will become poison because of them. I researched on this and Sent a report to the government long back to close these factories. Do you know what they did? They dismissed me from my job. Since my name is Siva Kumar, they asked me consume the poison. So I consumed it. Do you know one thing? That report is still here. Will you give me that report? Will you get me a bottle like this? Come fast. Watch man, what happened? - I am seeing to it. Please move Apartment next to ours has power. What happened to us? Somebody has switched off the main. Oh no! Where is Manga? She is running away. - Catch her. We will know about his where about. You go and see there. - Okay. I will check here. Kill her. Dear Manga! Start the car. Hey, stop. I have got it... This is it. - Do not shout. There she is. Faster... faster... What happened? There she is. Hey, stop. Hello, Edukondalu! I am Swapna speaking. Swapna, a good news. I have got the file. Why there is no one at home? We have admitted Manga in the hospital. What? She met with an accident. - How? Swarna and her goons Actually, they came for you. As they did not get you. They took their revenge on Manga. If they find you, they will not spare you. Be careful. What did doctor say? Very lucky There is no head injury. Her neck got hurt. Doctors said that it will take 4 -5 days. Scoundrels! They hit her with a car. She was about to run over by the train. She is lucky to be alive. This is enough for today. Let us go. Is it you? How are you? What happened to you? You said to take action against them if I am a real man. I tried. But they branded me a mad man. Everyone is calling me as a mad man. I will not worry if someone else had called me. Even my wife and children think that I am a mad man. They are scared to come to me. I am worried about that. Do you want to destroy them? Come... come... Park the jeep in a corner. - Yes, sir. Hey Kiran, are you fine? - I am fine. Have you joined the duty again? - Yes. It is all the mercy of Edukondalu - I am very happy. You seem to have put on some weight. - Nothing like that. Is Minister inside? - Yes, He is. Be careful... Be careful and take care. - Okay sir. You were not seen these days... You look beautiful. - Get lost. No... No... Do not kill me. Sir... sir, you come. I had stolen it. Where will you go, my boy? - Hey, no. Do not kill my brother. - Shall I kill you? Sister! Oh my brother! Hey... Minister, since you Do not need their help now, you asked me to kill them. So, I have killed them. I have completed my job. Minister, catch it. Put him behind the bars. Hang him. Sorry sir, we cannot do anything. Why? - Because he is a mad man. Law will not punish mad people. Hey, you scoundrel! Why did you kill my brothers? I will... Swarna, Do not believe his words. Do not believe that mad man. Who is mad? You said that he is not mad. I will not spare you. Sister, do not drag him. - I will not spare you. Make an enquiry as how he had escaped from hospital. Greetings, are you fine? What are you doing at home sitting all alone? Are you counting your remaining fishes? Why are you getting tensed? I sent that C.I. to your place. You made him mad and I fooled you with his help. It means I made you to poke your eye with your fingers. How is my Bobbarlanka punch? Your influence has gone to the dogs. Your power has vanished into thin air. And it is your post which is remaining. I will be seriously working on it. What is this? Though we all said 'No'. You somehow convinced us and made Swarna to join our party. If she could hold your collar in public What is the relation between you and that rowdy gang? Now, it is this issue, the other day, it was an issue of Shakila. Our party is going to get tarnished because of you. Majority of our party men are against you General body meeting of Party will be held in couple of days. May be that will be the last meeting you will attend. You can go now. Hubby, some woman is threatening me with a vegetable cutter. Vegetable cutter! Give them what they want? Who are they? Do not know. - Keep the phone close to my ears. I am murderess Mangathayaru speaking. Do you remember me? How can I forget you? What made you to use the vegetable cutter in this way? You must meet my grandson immediately. Or else I will cut the neck of your Wife. Do not do that. Tell me where Edukondalu is? I am here. What is it Edukondalu? What is all this? You must do me a small favour. - What is it? Tell me. Tomorrow is your party meeting, is not it? Who is party? - Ruling party. - Yes. You must mix this in the water they drink. What is this? - How many wives do you have? Only one. - Just do what I say? Janashakthi Party Office In the party house Chief Minister and his cabinet and media persons fell ill Everyone were taken to the hospital immediately. But officers said that their lives were not in danger. When these things are in process? One young man came to our office accepting the responsibility. What happened? You will now watch his verdict. Greetings! I am Edukondalu from Bobbarlanka. I am not a terrorist. Hoping that our leaders will do good for us. I am one of the voters who voted for them. What our ministers had is not poison. But, it is our lake water. They have been hospitalized for drinking that water just once. Our villagers are drinking that water for years and are dying. Because of the factory in our village, our farms, lands, lakes are ruined. We believed a minister and came here hoping that our problems will be solved. He has not only ruined us but also our state. He would still do a lot. Actually our village problem should have been solved long back. But the man I told you became a hurdle to that also. I have all the evidences against him Because him, I have faced many problems. And even touched the doors of death. After all that I am now speaking to you If Chief Minister allows me I will identify the culprit with evidence I will not mind even if you hang me for what I have done. But, it is enough if something good happens to my village. When contacted the Chief Minister on phone regarding this He wants to tell you what had happened And want to identify that minister to you. What is your opinion on this? The Government must know the problems of people before people come up with them. If it does not do so, such people will point it out. For him and his village, I express regret on behalf of the Government. Do you know who that minister is? - I will know it. Let it be any one, there is no chance of forgiving him. He has given an appointment to meet him tomorrow at 10 A.M. Ask Swarna to come. - Will she come? She will come. Not only that, I must meet C. M. tonight at any cost. - Okay sir. Arrange for it. - Okay, sir. - Go. Did you watch the T.V.? Have you at least now understood the drama He is playing? The other day he killed your brothers Now, He is about to make me lose my post Tomorrow morning Not only the Chief Minister post Even my 20 years political life will be up rooted and thrown to the streets. Bear one thing in mind. It is not just me who is going to get ruined. You all too What should I do now? - Do anything, you like. But he should not meet the C.M. tomorrow. C.M. has asked you to meet him tonight at 10.30 PM You go. - Okay sir. You heard him, did you not? I will look after C.M. tonight. You take care of Edukondalu. Leave that to me. If C.M. dies, Edukondalu will be blamed for it. Everyone will think that C.M. died because of the poison he gave. No one will suspect us. Hello! - Murderess Mangathayaru speaking. I am Subramanyam speaking. Is Edukondalu there? I want to tell him an urgent matter. So, the leak is here. Sister, this is his house phone number. Then, Edukondalu must be there. Where is he? - I do not know. Do not know? I will... Tell me where Edukondalu is... - I do not know. Do you not know? - I do not know. Will you tell me or shall I kill you? Tell me where he is? - I will tell you. Tell me. Edukondalu is here. Oh god! Search the entire house. You search the first floor. - Come, let us go. Where is he? - I Do not know. Did you keep her in your house without knowing that? I swear I do not know. Tell me the truth. - I swear, I do not know. Tell me. Do you not know? Do you not know? I will kill you if you do not tell me. Tell me. - Believe me. She is trying to escape. Catch her. Hey... Catch her... catch her. The marriage was conducted in a grand manner. It is marriage of a rich family. They paid us also very well What is it? - They are trying to kill me. Help me. Stop So many man to beat an old lady? - Who are you to question us? Hey, catch her. Hey, you asked me to tell where my grandson is? I will not tell, instead I will show him to you. If you can see him and withstand, see him. Look, He is coming, a valiant hero Raging like a fiery lava spitting volcano If he comes he will not go away before crushing your bones A hero of the heroes and warrior of the warriors No one is there to challenge him He is a one man army In one punch he floored 3 opponents In one kick he has pinned down 4 enemies All will die if he goes all out after them Beat them... beat them If he comes he will not go away before crushing your bones A hero of the heroes and warrior of the warriors Look at his eyes they are like the eyes of a hungry tiger His breath is like the angry hiss of a King Cobra His fingers are like daggers Look at his muscular strong body If he gets his act together he is God of death to his opponents He is a fiery crusader If he comes he will not go away before crushing your bones A hero of the heroes and warrior of the warriors If he gets enraged he will break open you skulls He will open your chest to scoop out your hearts He will spit fire with lightning eyes He will make thunders strike with his closed fists Will not they break into bits and pieces? Will you not run away like rats from a sinking ship? Will you not fall like dry leaves when a typhoon strikes? Will you not be reduced to ashes when mountain of fire falls on you? He is a god of death out to squeeze out your lives He is a sun in the hearts of the people Edukondalu, nothing happened to you, is not it? I Will not spare you. Brother... brother...
