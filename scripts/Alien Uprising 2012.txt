Military truck down, one dead, moving into the entrance. Alpha Team 3 and 6 in position. At location. We have confirm on location, sir. I hate this form. It's a miracle these fucks survived this long. Love the adrenaline, though! You are a-firm for entry. I repeat, a-firm for entry. We are go for entry. Who are you? What unit are you with? We are go for terminate. I repeat, go for terminate. Please, no! Come on, piece of shit! Come on!

What look? That look. The look only a female can portray. Oh, pray tell! Irrational concern, almost impossible to deal with! Girls don't always require solutions, you know. I know, I know, just a sympathetic ear. Believe me, I know. Come on, you said you wanted to talk. So, talk. You said, "different." Different? Exactly! Well, I wasn't expecting this when I wanted you to-- Does this mean that you-- Don't ruin it. Don't ruin it! What? This counts as different? Of course it does! When was the last time you had a conversation on the rooftop of a car? Oh, I haven't, ever! Well, there you go! I wasn't expecting this! Baby, if you had some preference of difference, then you should have been more specific. Romance, babe! Isn't it traditional to have a little bit of it? Ah, pfft! If I'd been traditional, I wouldn't have been different, would I? There are reasons for some traditions, babe. Did George put you up to this? No, no! He said I should definitely not do this. Probably should have listened to him, then. Yeah, but you know me better, baby! I do. So, the whole rooftop of a car? Isn't working. Oh, come on! Not even a little bit? No. You feel nothing? No. All right, well, maybe I should stop. I didn't say that. Don't be fooled! Excuse me? It's not-- I'm not just good looks, okay? There's so much more to me! Certainly not modesty. You're American, that's it! I used to live in America. Your eyes are so beautiful! Have you seen Blade Runner? Life's made up of moments. All those moments will be lost in time. I still can't believe it! Has it ever happened to someone else? No, sounds unbearable. It is! Look, I'm sorry! I'm sorry, I'm sorry! You know, you've got it absolutely right. You have such a way with words, pretty lady. You know what actually makes it worse? The fact that she distracted me from a very dark secret in my life. Now, I'm not proud of it, but-- that's a very big "but"-- it was something that I was able to deal with when I found something similar, but not so special, do you know what I mean? Yeah, every word. This is absolutely crazy, because no one understands me. No one understands the real me, and here you are, on my level. Dana, you know that I've been to darker places than I'd ever care to admit in the last few years. Hey, no! no! Do not leave! There are moments when I literally questioned absolutely everything. I know you know what I'm talking about. And then, there's you. You, someone beyond my capabilities of description. So wonderful that you pulled me out of all that. You showed me how to love again when all I knew how to do was hate. And I promised you I'd be with you forever, no matter what life throws at us. This is my keeping that promise. God, this is so fucking cheesy, I'm sorry. No, no, cheese is good! I like cheese! I choose my words very carefully when I say you literally saved my life. Robbie, what are you doing? I can't have your mum's ring! Dana Charlotte Williams... will you marry me? Yeah, of course I will, you daft prick! Are you sure you want me to have your mum's ring? Hey, it's your ring now. Nah, you got me-- You want me to go back to your place. Absolutely not! Is that right? Yeah, you see, I stayed at my best friend's last night, so we'd, uh, have to go back to his. Would you judge me if I got emotional right now? Because honestly, I think I'm falling in love, Martha. Uh, Matilda. I'm going to go fi-- what the hell do you think you're doing?! This is a brand-new dress! But you gave me the kiss eyes! You gonna buy my missus a new dress or what? Hey, I'm sorry, stop! What is this, the Gestapo? Michael! Who the fuck is Michael? You'll see when he gets here. Yeah, sure! Oh, no! We can have babies! Yeah! We could. Good, great. What the hell is that? Nice try. No, seriously, look. Oh! It's a shooting star! It's too slow for a shooting star. Maybe the universe felt sorry for me, and thought I needed a bit of romance injected into this moment. Hey, come on! The speech was romantic, wasn't it? Hmm. Seriously, is it slowing down? Touch my mate again and I'll fucking knock you spark. Why don't you fuck off? Oh, am I supposed to give a fuck you work on a door? Try Afghanistan, mate. Typical fucking soldier! Robbie, don't you dare! You promised me! Baby, I can't just leave him, can I? He's my best-- Friend, I know, and I love your loyalty, but you've just proposed. Baby, I can't, okay? I've got to go. I'm your family now. Please, I'm asking you, don't do this again. Robin! Robin, no! Robin! Settle down! Michael, Michael, come on, walk it off. Listen to your girlfriend before you get hurt! What'd you say, gorgeous? I said, "Listen to your--" Ugh! Robin! Get off of him! Get off my fianc! I will fucking finish him, I will! Argh! All right, all right, let him go. Let him go, right? Come on, guys. Leave him. Alright mate, Jesus Christ, seriously. Baby, you okay? What the hell are you playing at? I'm fine. It's not what I'm playing at, Robin! Michael, what the fuck? It wasn't my fault, mate. It was fucking Vincent's! I leave him alone for five seconds, and half the fucking club starts on him. Cheers, Vinny. What? I didn't do anything! What you did, you wanker, was blow my chances with quite possibly the most beautiful girl I've ever seen in my entire existence. Honestly, mate, I don't think I did. What, really, Michael? The most beautiful girl you've ever seen? Mate, "beautiful" isn't even the word. I mean, she genuinely took my breath away. Her tits were unbelievable perky bouncers! I mean, straight in the wank bank forevermore! Do you know what I mean? Michael-- I mean, the kind of girl you go down on! You know the type! Classy as Hell, but they'd be complete filth in the bedroom! I mean, I bet she takes it in the fucking-- Michael! What? That 10 out of 10 gal you're talking about, she's behind you! You had me at "beautiful". Did I lose you at "wank bank"? An official statement released from Downing Street just moments ago assures all members of the public who are unduly concerned that these latest developments are nothing but a string of as-yet unexplained phenomena and nothing to worry about. However, they do make a beautiful sight as they light up the clear English night sky. He's done this before. What else was I supposed to do? The last thing I want to be is a moaning girlfriend. Ah, fiance! Exactly! You're asking me to question my loyalty! Bullshit! I just don't want to see you get stabbed! I was trying to stop Vinny from getting beaten up! Why didn't Michael just grab Vincent and run? Oh, just get naked! Just, it happens all the fucking-- What? You heard, strip. You should be so lucky. 'Cause you're far too classy a chick to do that. What kind of a slut do you take me for? Do you think we could take them? Ah! Morning, Mr. Bradburn! Morning, Mr. Petersen. So, you're feeling very delicate this morning, then? Yeah, had a bit of a late one last night. Yeah, I know. I heard you all coming in about half past three this morning. Sorry about that, mate. That's all right. Looks like you're paying for it now, though. Yeah, I am. You don't have any paracetamol, do you? You know what, you might be in luck. Oh, perfect. Is your power out, by the way? Yeah, yeah, whole street's out. Has been since about half-six this morning. Really? Any idea how long for? No idea at all. Anyway, I'm off to go see Deborah down in London! Bit of a drive, isn't it? Yeah, well, she got a sudden call last night to an emergency meeting. So, I suggested she goes out on the train. I could follow her down, pick her up, maybe hit a show. What was the emergency? Now, now, Vincent, you know the rule in the Petersen household. Tell no lies. I know, I get it. I just think it's a bit weird you don't know what she does. Government domestic crisis management, Vincent. Hi, Mr. P. How you feeling this morning? Ungh. Can I borrow your phone? I need to call the club about Dana's jacket. What's wrong with your phone? No reception. Oh, that's weird. I had the same trouble this morning. And the land line, haven't been able to get hold of Deborah. That's probably something to do with the power here. Doesn't usually affect the mobile phone signal. Yeah, this has got no bars, either. What? Oh, fuck. This piece of shit phone. What, uh, network you on? I'm on Orange. Oh, maybe the reception tower thingies are down. And the land lines? Well, there'd be something about it on the news. Try the radio. Have you brushed your teeth? Not yet, mate. Nope. Try A.M. No, it is A.M. Try F.M. Huh, you think whatever's messing up the reception towers is screwing with the radios? Oh, well. I have no idea, gentlemen. And as much as I hate to love you and leave you, I need to get to London to meet Deborah. Now, look, I'm sure the power won't be out all night, but if it is, I'll be back in the morning. Then, I can let you know what I know. Drive safe, Mr. Petersen. Well, look who it is. Hey, there's the walk of shame if ever I saw it. Heh, heh! Oh, Michael! Your, uh, your prescription arrived this morning. The cream, for your rash? Hilarious! You think of that one all by yourself? If you scratch, it's going to spread! You have a rash? I don't know how that dickhead does it. Neither do I, but he does do it bloody well. Yeah. And she is certainly the most, uh, dope of them all. See you later, Mr. P. Take it easy, boys. Well, how you feeling? Oh, my stomach hurts, and I feel like shit. No, about Tina. Did last night help? We haven't got any electricity. Or phones. What? What could have caused that? Well, there's no way of knowing, is there? Oh, what is that? I can't even see! There some sort of blinding light emanating from your finger! You didn't tell Vincent? An engagement ring? You're getting fucking married? Uh, yeah, I'm getting fucking married. I'm sorry, mate. It's just the hangover and everything else. You all right, Vin? Yeah, I'm cool. I feel a bit sick. I'm going to lie down. I feel like I have to throw it out there that I normally don't do this. Sleep around with guys, or latch onto them? Excuse me! I could go back to the hostel if you like. Oh, relax! I already told you, I don't want you to go anywhere. Didn't I? Well, thanks, I'm glad. What's he doing? Who? You didn't see that? I swear to God, I just saw... Jesus! Fuck! They're already here. What, who's there? They're already here. You can't see, can you? You can't see and you won't see? It's 24-36, 24-36. 24-36, Matthew. No one understands the hour, no one understands the day, not even the angels, the angels in Heaven above. Not even the Son! The Father-- the Father-- the Father-- Father understands! Right, okay, yeah. It's already too late for you. Come here. You beware of the colour purple. It's the culmination, it's the culmination. You've wandered a bit off the beaten track, all right? It's the culmination. You'll not find many responses to begging around here, I'll tell you that. Begging? What are you talking about, begging? What, down on my bended knee? No, no. If you truly, and truly, utterly believe in a life after next-- Oh, I don't do religion, mate. Look, you're wasting your time. Have this, all right, fella? Fuck you. Oh, easy. I don't need your money! I don't want your money. Let me give you some fucking advice. You look around you. You breathe it in, you drink it up, and you enjoy it! Because there's nothing else you can do. Sorry. Sorry. 24-36. 24-36! Sneaky little fucker. What the hell was that about? I have no idea. Maybe there's a torch in our bedroom. Yeah, but we should save that for emergencies. Well, there's a whole lot of candles in the loft, my mom put there. She used to love candles. Do you mind if I go get them? No. Look, um, look, I'll go. You know, I've been thinking about Tina recently. Well, you're bound to. It's still fresh. Yeah, I feel a bit weird talking to you about it, though. You know, after-- Look, I told you it's fine. Don't worry about it. She'll be genuinely unnerved by all this. No, I'll tell you what she is. She'll be shitting herself. No offence, Vin, but it's not really your problem anymore. Don't let it upset you. Upset me? I'm fucking loving it. The bitch dumps me, now she's paying the price. I know that she's sitting there, wishing I was around to protect her. Yeah, you know that, Dana. Of course. Well, look, at least I'm here, for you. And engaged or not, Dana, it makes no difference. I'll always be there. Cheers, Vin, nice of you to say so. Hey, I'm a nice guy! Now, get the fuck out of here! I used to actually cause havoc in this store right here. Hey, mate! Pete, mate, how you doing, brother? How are you? All right, yeah? I'm good, yeah. I didn't know you were back. Yeah, only for a couple of weeks. Been up to see George? Next week. Tell the crazy bastard Peter said hello. I will do, mate. I will do. Uh, Carrie, Pete. Pete, Carrie. Hello, darling, how you doing? You all right? Yes. So, are you not opening up today? I can't, mate. The power's fucked, isn't it? Any idea what's going on? No, mate, but I do know it's as far as Leeds. Leeds? Fucking hell! Where's Leeds? It's about a two-hour drive from here. How'd you know, Pete? You know Curtis Ralph? Yeah, yeah, well, his girlfriend lives over in Leeds, and he drove down from there this morning. Said it's exactly the same up there, and everywhere in between. Shit! I've never heard of one so far spread in the U.K. before. Think that's fucked up, mate, check this out. This one is reserved especially for your mother, all right? No problem, mate, go on. Ready? Yeah, go on. What's that? What's that? Don't tell Dana about this, all right? Or Vincent, for that matter. Fucking hell, can you imagine? I'll tell you, mate. It's all getting a little bit real for my liking. Oh, what the fuck is going on? What the fuck? Wait, uh, Jurassic Park! Yes, dinosaurs! Uh, Terminator? Are you doing a bawdy dance? It's a mummy! Flintstones! Um... Thriller? Flipper? Um, Wild Wild West? No, no, he's presenting! Brokeback Mountain! You're so good! What, what, I don't understand. What are you doing? Come on, we give up. What is it? It's Footloose! It's the fucking dance from Footloose! That was terrible! That was Footloose? I thought this was a gay film, mate! Fuck you, it isn't, and you know it. Who watches Footloose, anyway? I do! Well, I hope the power goes more often 'cause this is loads of fun, isn't it? Speaking of which, at what point do we do something, and what do we do? Doesn't the government have procedures for this kind of thing? Solar flare! I was watching the news the other day, and there's this big-time scientist geezer who said that once every couple of hundred years, the sun beams its light so powerful, it cuts off all the electricity. I don't know why you're doing that. It's true. Fuck, Vinny, come on! That's bullshit! Look, hang on, hang on! He's right, I saw it too. Thank you, Dana. A dirty bomb, that'd do it. Don't start that again, mate. It would though, mate. What is that? It's a small nuclear device, right? You can fit it in the size of a briefcase. Set it off in a major city, say, Birmingham or even Nottingham. Why would anyone want to blow up Nottingham? Why not? I mean, think it through, really. Set a bomb off in a small city and no one will feel safe. Exactly. Guys, come on, seriously. If a filthy bomb had gone off, we'd have heard something! Dirty! A what? Dirty bomb, mate. A dirty bomb, a filthy bomb, If you and Captain America want to go out here and fight evil-- He wouldn't exactly help, now, would he? Look, do you actually think there's a bomb? Do you actually think we're in trouble? Doesn't Mr. Petersen's wife deal with stuff like this? Look, Mr. Petersen said his wife was in London for some emergency government meeting. Do you think the government knew something? I mean, what do you think they'll do? Look, come on, guys. The power's going to be back on in the morning. We should all just get some sleep. Or some sex. Shh! What time is it? Half twelve. No, babe, it's much later than that. No, this clock says half twelve, as well. Dana, what time did your watch stop? 12:36, babe, why? Everyone heard that, right? Oh! Jesus. Such a jackass! You dick! Oh, it's nothing, guys, relax! Vincent! Ah, such a dick. Oh, you're busted. I saw you, Vinny! Yeah, you did! Babe, you've got to admit, it's a bit weird. All the clocks stopping, and everything else going on. Oh, what are you stressing for, you daft thing? I'm not! Yeah, you are. You've got me to look after you. Look at this! Like that? Dickhead! You don't need to worry about anything, okay? Look, don't be freaked out. Mr. Miller! Are you trying to comfort me, or are you trying to get laid? Is "both" the wrong answer? Come on! Oh, look at this, candlelight, and it's cozy. Try eerily quiet, scary, dark. No, think of it as romantic and intimate. Yup? Vinny, baby! Hi, guys. What's up, mate? Ah, nothing. Nothing much. Vinny, what the fuck are you doing in my bedroom? Well, I don't know, just... I don't know why you're in my bedroom, either. Our. You know, just thinking, and, and stuff. Can we do this tomorrow, mate? Is that all right? Look, I'm really freaked out, if the truth be told, and I was wondering if I could sleep in your room? Please be kidding. Yes, you are! You're afraid of the dark, get out! It was a good one! Robin! All right! Vinny! Yeah? Keep on the floor. You are a legend, Robin-o. You are a legend! Hey, you know, I could be really quiet. Get off! Huh? Nothing, you! Oh. Fuck her, go on! Dana! Dana! Dana! Are you okay? How the hell should I know, Vinny? Earthquake, big one! In the U.K.? Where the fuck is that coming from? I have to take a closer look. No, you can't go out. Shut up, Vincent. What do you think it is, Michael? Come on, come on! Jesus. Would the army attack? We need to get practical, get supplies. Dana's right, we should leave. Inside, get dressed. Now! Vinny, come on! Vin, you okay? You all right, babe? No, I'm really starting to fucking lose it! Vinny, try to remain calm. If you breathe out too much carbon dioxide too quickly, it will just make you feel lightheaded and panicky. What's making me feel panicky is the sight of a fucking spaceship outside! You'll be fine. Don't worry. Shit, it's crazy! God, Jesus! Someone's going to get hurt. Why don't they just open the doors? There's nobody around to make that call, is there? Look, there must be somewhere else we can go. I should take two girls just to be on the safe side. Vinny, you're such a pussy! Don't speak to me like that, Dana. Mike, what are we going to do? Just stay tight. Everyone's just panicky, that's all. Aren't you? Yeah, everyone stay close. Carrie, come here. Hey, you! Hey, you, come here! Excuse me! Excuse me, but you can't do that. I was here first. Back off, sweetheart. Look, stand behind me like everyone else. Stand behind the fucking immigrants? Giving me fucking backtalk now? What are you talking about? It's only fair that you do that. I was here first. It's only fair, partner. Shut up, love, get back on your boat, and fuck off home, yeah? You got supermarkets in Africa? Tell you what, why don't you stand outside one of them in your own fucking country? My husband is English. He works away, and I have to feed my children. I have every right to do that. Yeah, yeah, yeah, tell you what. Don't make me tell you to shut up again, all right? Don't you talk to me like that. Why don't you fuck off, you stupid-- You have no right! Relax, relax, relax! Chill out, chill out, chill out! Mikey! All right, listen, I'm the assistant manager here, all right? The manager's coming out any minute. He's going to let everyone in, all right? But he's not going to do it in the middle of all this mess. So, chill out, and I promise you I'll make sure you get in first, and get whatever you want. I want him. No! Just fuck off, mate. You fuck off! Act your own fucking age. Fuck you! You got keys, mate? What are you fucking doing causing all this fucking fuss? Man, how are you getting in? Tell me! Pete, can you please let us in? Just-- just us. We'll just get the essentials. Come on, friend, please. Good. Okay, go and get that woman, then. Okay, be safe. Be quick, okay? Babe! Come on, let's go! Come on! Oh, shit! Hey, are you okay? Shh! Hey, don't worry about it, okay? What the fuck, Pete? It's all right. What's your name? Selma. Look, her name's Selma. We're just going to help her get some food. Please, it's the right thing to do! She's got family. Please, Pete. It's all right, mate. You're taking the fucking piss, mate. What the fuck is wrong with you? How the hell have you got these lights on? That's for the whole complex, on an emergency generator. All right, keep your fucking heads down. All right, boys. Anyone sees us out there, they're going to cause a fucking riot. What do we get? Tinned food and water. After you. Grab tinned food! Tinned food! What's that over there? Michael! Just the essentials! That is essential! Look, keep your voices down. Come on! Wait, everyone get low now! Michael! Everyone get down and stay low! Michael! Shh, Vinny, wait! They can fucking see me, Michael! Mate, they fucking see me! All right, mate? Michael, I'm going to run for it! No, do not run for it! If you run, you'll cause a riot! Mike, they fucking see me! Run! Fucking hell! Michael! Back up. Michael, stop! Hey, hey, hey! Look, friend, I need you to get out of here. Okay, lock it up! Hey, come here, come here, come here. Look, take that food and go out the back door! Go straight home! Thank you! Thank you! We need to go here! Now, come on! Let's go! Let's go! Give me the gun back! Hide behind the girl, won't ya? Fuck you! Michael, are you okay? I'm fine, Carrie. Thanks, Pete. Excuse me, guys. Excuse me? Don't mean to be rude. Come on! Slow down, guys. Keep going! You walking towards me for any particular reason? Yeah, we're just wondering if you'd be so kind as to lend us some of that water you've got. And a can or two of your food? Yeah, we've got families to feed, you see? Oh, well, if you boys have families to feed, may I suggest you get yourselves across to the supermarket sharpish before everything sells out. There's quite the sale on. Ah, truth be told, we thought we'd just hang around outside, wait until what we wanted came out, and then just take it. You see, we don't do supermarkets. What madness, ha ha! See, my friends and I might have something to say about that. Really? Yeah. Me and my friend think you and your friends are just bunch of pussies. And I'd quite like to see them try and stop us from taking all their food. Is that right? Yeah. And the fuel, as well. Nah! You're forgetting about my brother. Oh, where is he, then? Oh! Michael! Michael! Take it easy! See, in a crisis like this, how long do you reckon it'll take for an ambulance to respond to a gunshot wound, huh? they won't come near the scene until armed response arrive, and that's just standard procedure. And then, you've got-- There's me forgetting. You won't even be able to call an ambulance, will ya? In fact, chances are you'll just bleed to death right on the street. Michael! Calm down, mate. We're just messing with you. Everyone in the car? Michael, come on! Let's go. Don't do anything stupid. Don't worry, mate, Carrie fired the last three bullets at the ceiling. Good! Go, go, go! Hey, yeah, yeah, yeah! Hey! Come back with that! Watch while we turn on each other. All right, we need to get this stuff inside quickly and quietly. I think we've been spotted. Vinny? Hey, Jerry! How's it going over there? Look, I'm telling you now, I am not willing to hurt anyone. I don't care what the situation is. Give it time. You're not desperate enough yet. Starting to feel like a bit of a target out here. Come on, move! Don't push me! Jesus, Michael, come and sit down. I'm all right, Dana, I told you. Michael, come and sit down! Jesus, woman, I'm fine! I ain't feeling this. No, I don't think it's safe here. We should go to George's. Who's George? Let's just say he's a controller short of a PlayStation. No, I don't even think he'll want to see us. Well, it's worth a shot. Michael, worst case, we go there, come back and turn around. We won't have the option, I'm afraid. Why not? The fuel tank's full. It is, but I have to go back to my house first. Why, what for? Bullets, we're completely out. Jesus Christ, Michael, surely we can get by. The gun itself is scary enough. Look, you've seen what it's like out there. It's only going to get worse, believe me, all right? We need all the help we can get. I'll be as quick as I can. If I can grab extra fuel, I will. Maybe we should all go. It's in the opposite direction. It's crazy to risk us all. Look, I'll pick everyone up on the way back. Fine, I'm coming with you. Thank you, Robin. Like hell you are! Baby, please. Carrie, I think it's best if you stay here, all right? I don't give a fuck anymore what you think. Dana and Robin are going to stay together, and Vincent doesn't look like he's going to step up. I don't care what you say. There's no fucking way you're coming in that car with me, all right? Simple as that! I should look for gas stations, right? Sure. Robin and Dana seem close. I get a good vibe from them. Yeah, they've been together for a while now. A couple years ago, Robin's, uh, Robin's parents died. I'm sorry to hear that. Yeah, car accident. Some drunk driver. Dana doesn't see her parents, hasn't for years. Until the car accident, Robin was always the one who took care of Dana, you know? But then in the aftermath, she really stepped up. What about your family? My parents? Ha! Let's just say my dad wasn't the nicest of men. And then, Vinny, Vinny's folks live on the coast, so he rarely sees them. And I think that's why we all stay so tight. I guess your folks would be worried sick right now. With everything that's been happening, I haven't really thought about it all. I'm not really that "phone home" type of person. Anything? It's locked. I'm going to have to break it. All dry. Sorry? Huge army trucks turned up this morning, within 12 hours of the blackout, policing their fuel. Left not a drop. The army must be communicating. Not necessarily. The boys at the local base would have actioned a pre-determined plan. Seems to me those boys knew something. All those ships, those UFOs, they're toying with us, waiting to see what we're going to do about it. Perhaps it's a game to them, floating around the universe entertaining themselves. UFOs? You've seen more than one? Three, my friend. I saw three, with my own eyes. One after the other. Frightened the life out of me, I won't lie. It must be happening all over the world. You think with that sort of technology, we'll present any problem to them? When they attack, and make no mistake about it, they will attack, the human race will be essentially screwed. Or, shit, they might keep a few of us on farms, or as pets maybe. I guess there'll be some resistance, living in sewers or places like that. Maybe they're explorers. Why do you assume they're here to fight? If they're some kind of intergalactic Christopher Columbuses, no peace is going to last long. Certainly not with that attitude. All those itchy trigger-fingered politicians the world over, finally facing their own mortality. How long do you think it'll be before they launch an attack? Humans fear what they don't understand, young lady. In your heart of hearts, you'll know that. Sorry I haven't got anything sugar-coated for you, but I just can't see any good coming. Or maybe they won't attack, of course. They might just sit and wait. Watch while we turn on each other, do the job for them. Shit, we've already started to. It'll turn into survival of the fittest. I have to agree with that. Don't look too good for an old man like me, do it? Hell, I don't shine a beautiful light on mankind, either. I can't stand this waiting around. What else can we do? Mr. Petersen's wife. If she knew something, then she'd have papers or information in the house. Don't be so stupid. Well, what have we got to lose? It's worth a shot. Breaking and entering? Ring any bells? Robin, you know I'm right. It's worth a try. As if she's going to keep sensitive government documents about aliens in a fricking drawer in her study? Nobody asking you to come, Vinny. So, you, uh, have much family in America? Michael, I came to England to learn more about your culture and the way you think about things. No different to yours, sweetheart. You should have gone to China or something. Why do you put cows in charge of your fucking country? Oh, and your president's a hero, is he? Is a politician going to start a war? Look out! Shit! Aw, shit! Oh, fuck! You'd be a great cat burglar in your next life, babe. Is she dead? Michael, Michael! He's alive! We need to save him. We need to save him. There's petrol leaking all over the fucking-- We need to save him! Fine, all right! He's alive! Fine, fine! Let me check him. Let me check him. Let me check him. Let me see him. Let me see. This man is bleeding internally, Carrie. There's nothing we can do for him. Michael, we need to help him! Fine, we'll help him! Michael, what are you doing? I'm trying to help him! Why do we need to help him? Stop it, stop it! Listen to me! It's the kindest thing we could do for him, all right? This is what we have to do for him! Shh. Shh. Come on, Carrie, baby. Come on, Carrie! No, she's in the car! She's alive! There's a girl in the car! She's dead! Michael, Michael, no! Michael, no! No! There's a girl! She's alive! There's a-- She's alive! There's a fucking girl! She's alive! There's a girl here. There we go. Alright, come on, come on. Carrie, help me, please! There we go. There we go. There we go. Shit. It's all right. It's okay. Nice and slow, nice and slow, nice and slow. Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh. All right, I'm just going to take a quick look into, okay? Is it bad? Keep pressure on it now. She'll be fine if I can get it stitched up and something to clean the wound. Can she go to a hospital? Hospital would be madness, if there's even any doctors that have stayed on. It's all right, babe. There's a chemist around the corner. Shh, shh, shh, lay on your side. For fuck's sake, what's taking them so long? They're going to find shit. He's keeping her on a fucking leash. Anything? Baby, I can't stop thinking about what we did today. We snuck into that supermarket without a second thought for anyone else apart from that foreign lady. We did what we could for that woman. Most people wouldn't even have done that. Mr. Peterson? Mr. Peterson? Mr. Peterson, wait! Mr. Peterson! What happened? Where's your wife? Deborah, is she okay? What's going on? Is he all right? Hey, no, no! You are not leaving us! Mr. Peterson! Look, Andy, please. Listen, if you know something that can help me protect my fiance and my friends then you need to tell me. Please, run. What? Why? In which direction? They're coming! Who's coming? Who's coming? Run, Robin! Run! What's going on here? I'm a lieutenant in the army. I have a child who requires urgent medical attention. Not my problem. Try a hospital. Are you insane? This kid could die. Look, mate, we're not asking you to get involved. I just need a few things from inside. That's it. This place has been looted twice already tonight. Trespass on these premises, you will be arrested. So then arrest us. Let us just take care of the kid first. Why the fuck are you guarding a chemist in the first place? I mean, nothing more important kicking off tonight? I mean, don't you want to be home looking after your family? What I want is for you to fuck off before I take matters into my own hands. Oh, yeah? How exactly do you intend on doing that then? Guys, come on. Come on, okay? Back down. This is crazy. We're talking about a child's life. That's a man with the purple mark. You beware of the colour purple. Okay, look, I'm going to let you and the girl inside for five minutes. I'm going to be there to oversee anything you take. You fuck me around for even a moment and you'll regret this. Thank you. Carrie, wait by the car. Anyone goes near it, yell me, all right? I should come inside. Just wait by the car. It's okay. So is this your daughter? Huh? Yeah, it's my daughter. Okay, okay, let's make it quick, yeah? Get back! Get back! Carrie, please! Carrie, ah! I can't hold it much longer! Please! What the fuck was that? You just saved my life. You're nothing but a cold-blooded killer. I never wanted to experience what it feels like to kill. It was either him or us. Don't dwell on it. Why did he attack you? He was going for the girl. Is she all right? She's fine. We need to stitch her up. Check to see if he has an extra clip on him. And then we got to get out of here fast. I've never seen fear in a man's eyes like that before. No, don't even touch me please. Just get away from me. Just fuck off, all right? I'm fucking done. I'm fucking done. Oh, you love fighting, don't you? What? Seconds after asking me to marry you, you were at it. After saying you wanted a baby with me. No! If you like fighting so much, fight me. Come on, fight me! Come on! Risk your life like I don't mean shit! No! No! I've got you. I've got you. It's okay. It's okay. I'll take it, okay? I'll take it. 'Cause you'd do the same for me. You're with me, okay? Come here. You know how lucky you are? Dana Charlotte Williams, I love you. I've always loved you. I'm so sorry. What are you sorry for? Shh. Yeah, it's stressful. I understand. Everything's going to be okay. I promise. Yeah? It started. They're attacking us. And we're attacking them. Look at that. Jesus, have you ever seen anything like it? What the hell is that? There's hundreds of them. They're coming this way. Down! What? Baby? Shh, shh, shh! What the fuck is it? Fuck! Shit! Shit! Shut up! Shit! It's gone. Look. Look out! Listen, we've got to get George's. How are we going to get there? We'll steal a car. You've got to help me. No, I'm not going anywhere. Yes, you are. Can't she go? No. I'm not staying here. Please, baby, please just stay. Just for a moment. Go! Vincent, you look at me. You look after him. Yeah, well, why didn't you look after me? Great, so I'm the one who's going. Vincent, please look after him. We're fucking being attacked and I'm out here stealing cars. Brilliant. No, no, come on. Come on. Come on, piece of shit. Come on. Whoa, good shot! Get away from me, you bitch! Ripley, Aliens, that's an easy one! I was going to go with, "Welcome to Earth." You could never pull off Will Smith. Yeah, Will Smith can't fucking shoot like I can. Hey, you all right? Yes, I'm fine. I just need to get to my friends. Whoa, whoa, whoa. When did you lose contact with them? They're just down there. All right. Oh, what? We're babysitting civvies now, are we? Look, she's a fucking hot civvy. And besides, where's the squad? Yeah, now who's moaning, eh? Do you have any means of communication? The radios went down in the blackout. Heads up! No, no, please! No, please! They're my friends! Please leave them! It's okay! It's okay! Please! Hold your fire! Baby, is that you? Yeah! What are you doing outside the house? Well, I'm sorry! Who are you? They saved my life. It's okay. You saved my girl? Thank you. You helped my lady. I'm very grateful. It's fine. Are you as gutted as me that she's got a fella? I like this one, to be honest. But we couldn't get a car anywhere. Mike could pick us up down the road. What happened? Don't ask. We have a new recruit thought. What? I'm Lieutenant Michael Galloway, Fifth Brigade SAS. SAS? No shit. I'm Kenny. This is Sam. We're corporals. Nice. Where's your commanding officer? You're looking at us. I don't mean any disrespect but it's pissing down rain. And these UFOs can't be far. We need to move! Yeah, come on, we said we said we were going to go to George's! Let's go! Kenny and Sam should come too! Is that a good idea? They fucking saved my life, Carrie! Besides, safety in numbers, right? I agree. My uncle won't mind an extra couple of squaddies. I think these people are fucked without us. Agreed. All of us won't fit in the car. Fuck that, man. We got a truck around the corner. With a full tank of petrol. Let's move! Whoa! Whoa! Drop the weapon now! Relax! I got this! I told you, but you wouldn't listen! Put the gun down, friend. You don't understand. You have to trust me and you have to move away! No, you don't understand! You put that gun down or you're dead! Shut up! It's over. It's over. 24:36. What the fuck is he talking about? He's talking about the time on the clocks obviously. It's nothing. Drop the weapon! Shush, I can handle this! See, can't you see? It's staring you in your stupid faces. You are protecting the devil. Cut the cryptic shit out and drop the weapon! I got this! Just relax! No! Fucking don't do anything stupid! Only God knows that I am right. Kenny! You know what to do! Stand down! Do not do it! I told you. I told you but you wouldn't listen. I knew that fucker was going to shoot. Robin! Robin! Shit! No! Robin, no! No, no! Help me! No! Keep pressure on it now! All right, just taking a look, bro. Just going to taking a look! Just a scratch. It's just a scratch. Listen, I'm going to get you to George's. He's got the equipment I need to fix you up. All right, fellas, can you grab your truck, please? Fellas, can you please grab your fucking trucks, so I can help my friend? Look at me. Look at me. Look at me. It's going to be all right. Do you hear me? I love you. And you're my best friend. But I think I should talk to my fiance now. I don't think it's going to work out the way we planned. No, you promised me you'd stay! You promised me! I'm sorry. I'm sorry. It's okay. It's okay. Please stay with me, Robin. I can't do it without you. I can't do it. It's okay. No, please, please! I love you so much! I love you so-- No! No! No! Please no! Please! No, Robin, no! Please no! Come on. Time to go, Dana! Everybody move now! Time to go, Dana! Let's go now! We have to go now! No! Let's get out nice and slow and leave the guns. Leave the guns? Are you having a laugh? This gun goes where I go. It will go with you to hell if you keep hold of it outside this truck. You hear me? Who is this guy again, sir? Ex-military, black-ops, intelligence, you name it. Just trust me, all right? Black ops, fuck me. All right, here's the deal. The rifles stay in the truck. However, we take our sidearms with us, understood? All right. Okay, let's go. What the fuck is going on? MAN, OVER SPEAKER: Put your hands on your head and kneel on the floor! I'm not doing shit until I see who I'm talking to. Thank you very much, Sam. Antagonize him, genius move. Show yourself! And you are? With me. Uncle, mate, it's me, Michael. Well, I guess I should make you tea then. Where's Robin? It wasn't Robin's fault. Fucking idiot. Oh, guys, I'm sorry. I know how close you two were. He really looked up to you, George. Thank you, sir. She's still sleeping. She's stable. Just shush up. And what exactly are you planning on doing with her? I hadn't exactly thought it through, Vincent. Probably try and find extended family when it's safe. How noble of you. I take it the lights outside are battery powered. Yeah. You do know what's going on here? For a long time now. What's that mean? What they told you? Nothing. Well, nothing that we can openly discuss. You know the rules, George. I'm amazed we managed to launch an attack at all. How do you know? You can't see or hear anything from out here. How do you even know we attacked? I believe they came in peace. Aside from the power and communications, they have done nothing aggressive. Now, about the clocks, it's unusual. The tramp was talking about the clocks. No, he was referring to a Bible passage. No, the clock stopped at 12 or 24:36. 24:36! I think this person was talking about both. The clocks stop at 24:36 but that could also be a passage in the Bible. Matthew, something about the - "Only God knows when." Never thought you were the religious type, Michael. I'm not. This man quoted the passage to Carrie and I two days ago. Before the clocks stopped? 24:36: "No one understands the hour, no one understands the day but the angels, the angels..." A coincidence? Maybe, also could be a way of spooking us, stopping all the clocks at the same time. Answer the question, George. How did you know anything at all out here? Charlie 686, status please, over. Mother ship remains unaffected, sir. We've now attempted everything except Bright Light, over. Be advised, be advised, Bright Light is in the air. Awaiting confirmation, over. "Bright Light," that's no good. Where did you get that? The technology was always unexplained, but the rumours were there. It was the time of Area 51, don't forget. Every British and US base was issued one as a matter of protocol. But it is outdated now, or so I thought. Well, that must mean-- Somebody knew something but didn't say a thing. What could I have said? We discover an alien technology? Keep an eye on the sky, boys. Well, it would have been better than saying fuck all. Hey, come on, it would have caused panic, spread fears. And there's more. Great. The traffic over the radios been getting less and less. They're being taken out. Do you think they know we have the radio? Ever seen the movie Battle of the Bulge? Sure, what about it? You know, men dressing in enemy uniform, posing as enemy troops, infiltrating way behind enemy lines. What, these things have spies on the ground? That's crazy. How would they hide? I can only tell you what I've heard on the radio. In my days in intelligence, these kinds of things were discussed. Alien invasion scenarios? You're serious? Look, maybe if people with more open minds were in charge of talking to these UFOs instead of shooting at them, better, no? Makes sense. What better way to study us and gauge how we're likely to react? But Carrie's right. How are they disguising themselves? According to the info, they take human form. Almost impossible to tell. Listen, stick to your friends, people you know, and you'll be safe. Well, everyone here knows each other, right? I've known dickhead here for 15 years for my sins. Dana, Michael and I have known each other for years. What is it? Am I missing something here? Hold up. How long have you known her for? Why was our house the only house the UFO came back to twice? What was it that tramp was saying? Something like, "They're amongst us." Yes, I know. And we don't understand. And he was pointing the gun at her. Fuck, the bitch is ET. This is fucking bullshit. A purple mark. What? A purple mark in the shape of a triangle high on her inside leg. A purple mark? Like the policeman? Come here, darling? How the fuck does the kid know that? Language, Vincent. It's a very simple test. It can be done in a blink of an eye. I ain't taking no chances. Sam, strip the bitch. Definitely. Wait, stand down, soldier. That's an order. With your respect, sir, we're here to help these people. If I were you-- If anyone's going to do this, it will be me, in the other room, privately. Mm-hm, I bet it will. Watch while we turn on each other. Michael! You're nothing but a cold-blooded killer. So why do you assume they're here to fight? Life's made up of moments. I am genuinely sorry about this, Carrie. Before we do this, I think it only fair to be completely honest with you. You talk about moments. Well, I have a moment I won't ever be able to forget. I've been dishonourably discharged from the army. I haven't even told my friends yet. I lost my temper. You see, I started a fight and-- All those moments will be lost in time. Shoot the bitch! I said shoot the bitch. No need to be a hero, Dana. What's happening? It's fine, sweetheart. It's fine. George, please, take her. Stay behind me. Go staircase. Go, guys. Go, go, go! Clear! Clear! Clear! Go, go! Move! Move! Move! Run! Run! Run! Run! Move! Up, up, up, up, up! Down! Where is it going? Why didn't they finish us off? We have to get the girl. Get back! Fucking lunatic. Please don't harm me! The radio! That's what you want. Right here. Leave us alone. Oh, shit. Fuck this. Fuck me. Fuck. Fuck. What the fuck are you doing? Fucking go! Go, go, go! The keys! I can't find the fucking keys! Get in the fucking van, you little clagnut! Would you like some music, sweetheart? Oh, fucking come on. Ain't nowhere to run to, baby Nowhere to hide I got nowhere to run to Fucking gate is blocked! Jesus, gate's blocked. Go back to the farmhouse now! It's not love I'm running from It's just the heartbreak I know will come 'Cause I know you're no good for me You're no good But you've become a part of me Everywhere I go, your face I see Every step I take You take with me, yeah Ain't nowhere to run to, baby Nowhere to hide I got nowhere-- Kenny, Kenny, we can't stay here. We need to get back to the house. Move, come on. Come on, go, go, go! Where's Vincent? Who gives a shit? Kenny's dead! Look after the girl. Fuck him. Vincent! Vincent, move! Vincent, look at me! I'm not asking you. I'm telling you. Fucking move! Arrr, fuck! God, fuck! Fuck! Oh, my God! Kenny! Kenny! Kenny, look at me! We are going to get through this! Please, try to remain calm. I'm trying! Fuck! How the fuck are we going to do it by ourselves? Sam is dead! What the fuck good is he? Then why don't you fuck off then, you prick? No one wants you here anyway! I'll fuck you up! I'll fuck you up! What the fuck are you--? I don't give a fucking shit what anyone else says, Dana! You and I are meant to be together. You prick! I forgave you before and I never told Robin because I knew it would break his fucking heart knowing his best friend came on to his girlfriend! And I made fucking clear I wasn't interested. Yeah, well, he's fucking dead now, isn't he, Dana? Don't fucking fight it. It's what he would have wanted. You prick! Ah! Ah, you fuck! That's rude like! I will fucking kill you! I'm sorry! Do you hear me? I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I'm so fucking sorry. I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. That's my fucking girl! Come here! Come here! Vincent, no! Get off me! Get up! Get up! No, please! Please, no! Fuck you! Stay on the fucking table! No! Ah, fucking bitch! Stay down! Stay down! No, no, no, Vincent, please! Fucking shut up and listen to me! Fuck off! No! Stay the fuck down and fuck off! Piss off! Piss off! Ah! Fuck you! Stay down! I'm going to kill you! Fucking get off her! Kenny, that's enough! Kenny, that's enough, please! Get the fuck off! Kenny, that's enough! Get the fuck off me! Kenny, no, no! Move! I don't care what he's done. We can't kill him. Dana, move! No, wait, listen. Listen, the explosions, they've stopped. We might be safe. Please, please. Not in front of the girl. She's seen enough. Dana, he's got to die. You're better than this. Kenny, please. I'm sorry, Dana. No! What we do know is that power is returning It is impossible to estimate any kind of casualty counts But all emergency workers are being requested to return to their local bases. All doctors and nurses... It's her! That's-- that's Carrie! ...will need your help to get back on her feet. One thing is clear. Our troops launched an attack at approximately 12:30 Greenwich Mean Time. And they have been victorious in defeating whatever enemy decided to invade these shores and indeed the entire world. Please try to remain calm. Military truck down. One dead. Moving to the entrance. It's a miracle these fucks survived this long. Love the adrenaline, though. You are a-firm for entry. I repeat, a-firm for entry. You are go for entry. Whoa, whoa, who are you? What unit are you with? We have two males, two females. A positive ID on the female. Able to identify us. How would you like us to proceed, sir? With a purple mark. Arg! You are go for terminate. I repeat, go for terminate. That's affirmative. You here with me close KENNY, OVER RADIO: No! Please!
