Residents of South Los Angeles marched on City Hall for the third day in a row, protesting the lack of police protection in their community. The protests were touched off by the death of Mildred Thompson. Mrs. Thompson, her husband and two children died while sleeping. Their home was set on fire by suspected gang members involved in the drug trade. According to reports, Mrs. Thompson had confronted the leader of the notorious gang the Outlaw Syndicate, demanding that members of his gang... Yeah? ...no longer sell drugs in front of her home. Shit, Luck. I asked you to do one thing. One thing, and you can't even do that. Well, it's 3:00. He get out at 3:00. No, I can't leave here and go get him. I can't. Because I just got this job, dawg, and I'm not trying to fuck it up. Lucky... All right. I'm gonna get over there when I can, man. Yeah. How you doing, Mr. Brooks? This is Otis over in Security. Sir, my replacement is about 30 minutes late, and I gotta go deal with a family emergency that just popped up. No, I understand. No. No. It's my son, Mr. Brooks. Hello? What's up, L.A.? It's your girl Yo-Yo making it do what it do. Record temperatures continue today in what has been the longest heat wave in 27 years. Nine people have died from heat-related complications, and there is no end in sight. In South Los Angeles, residents of Watts Fowler continue their boycott of city services until the Mayor has addressed their grievances. Hey, look, I'm gonna have to lock the gate in a minute, Junior. -What up, boy? -What up? I thought Uncle Luck was supposed to pick me up. Yeah, he was. I'm trying to find him now. What happened to your face, Junior? Some boy tried to punk me. -You beat his ass? -Yeah. All right, then, get in the car. What did I tell you about fighting, Junior? You gotta be better than me when you grow up. You hear me? Yeah. Will you ever learn? I'm happy to see you, though. Oh, man! Cool! Give me that. Add that to your collection. Hey. Hey, look, Dad. Yeah. Talented horse. Dad? Yeah. Can I tell you something? Yeah. What's up? When I was standing back there in the schoolyard, I was thinking if nobody came back for me, what would happen? I'll always come back for you. Pinky promise? Pinky promise. -Dad? -Yeah. Can I have some ice cream? Yeah. We can get you some ice cream. Yes. -Got to stop by my job first. -Okay.

He is a distinguished author and scholar, Dr. Michael Eric Dyson. What's up, Dr. Dyson? Thank you so much for having me on the show. It's so good to have you here. I think it's very necessary for us as a community to organize our dissent against this animal, this beast, that has infested us in a negative fashion. These drugs have undermined us. What we call the political economy of crack and other drugs have really devastated us. And now, on top of that, drug gangs. Gangs that are involved in the business of distributing... How you doing, brother? Got a couple of suits here. I think that you would look really good in this one. What you think? No, I'm cool. It's on special. Yeah, I'm straight. Come on, now.

I don't know what kind of game you're trying to run on me... Not, no, no. I'm not, I'm not. But you done fucked up! Shut up. If you ever steal from me, you won't walk from this motherfucker alive. What you thinking about? Never fucking put your hands on a woman again. What the fuck's wrong with you? Never put your motherfucking hands on a woman. Shit... Fucking piece of shit! Thanks. Where else can we go find my son? Where else can we go look for him now? Let's get you to a hospital. Just drop me off where you found me. Somebody need to look at you. You're coughing up blood. I need to go back and try to get some of my shit, okay? That shit is gone. You need to just let me take you to your house. Don't need to be out here like this. I can't go home! If I don't come home with at least my bag and my minimum, P-Money's gonna fucking kill me! So what's your minimum? Five hundred. Just let me out of the fucking car. Just let me out! You ain't in no shape to go out there and hustle no $500 minimum. Who the fuck is P-Money anyway? Fuck. I'm so fucked. I'm so fucked. I'll give you the money. You help me, I help you. Find my little man. You're very sweet, but I don't think so. You got a better offer? Hey! Where's my little man? Dad! We got Jennifer. That's what I'm talking about. Old bobblehead-ass motherfucker, shake that thing. Shake that thing. Look at all that ass, bitch. He wants... Get in here. The fuck happened to you? Where little man at?

Ain't nobody just gonna take your motherfucking son, nigga. Not my little cousin, nigga. Fuck that shit. Look, I'll be back, all right? I'm gonna be back. I'm gonna hit you, all right? We family, right? We family, right? Yeah. Family. Right. You know, this house don't really suit you. It was my grandmother's house. Who you living with? P-Money and four other girls. We do all the fucking hustling, and he makes all the money. I'm just trying to make enough money so I can get out of it. What's your son's name? Otis Junior. So you're Otis Senior? Yeah, they call me O2. "O2?" Back in the day when I was on the block, I used to go to these different neighborhoods and set it off. Then I would disappear. Just vanish. So they started calling me "Oxygen." It got so crazy, they just doubled it up, started calling me O2. So you were in the life? Before I got locked up. So you couldn't vanish when it counted most, huh? How long? I did six years. Only been out on parole for a month. So, I suppose shooting up people and having a gun and all that shit is probably a violation of your parole, huh? I got the gun from work. You got the gun from work? It's a part of a program for ex-cons. I'd have never took the gun if the dude who was supposed to be coming to replace me would have showed up. So you stole it? I was going to take the gun back. That sounds like bullshit to me. That's why I can't go to the police. I got two strikes. All it takes is one more. They don't buy my story, it's a wrap. What about Junior's mother? Where is she? Let's go get my son. Earlier today, on the eve of the Mayor's much anticipated visit to South Los Angeles, two people were executed on the very street that tomorrow's anti-crime rally is scheduled to take place. This video was taken at the scene. Police are looking for an unidentified man bearing these tattoos. If you recognize this man, please contact the local... I better go find Junior before they find me. Please don't do this, man! You ain't got to do this, Meat. I tell you, I'm gonna have it by tomorrow, man. -Hello. -Not now, O. I gotta call you back. See this right here? -What the fuck was that noise? -Nothing. Listen, meet me at the spot in 15 minutes. This is a dumb nigga. Yeah, gone. And this is what happens to dumb niggas if they don't pay their taxes. Every liquor store, every grocery store, and every motherfucking restaurant around here owes me. You bring me my money, you get your arm back. Shit, if you hurry, you might even be able to sew this motherfucker back on. Get back to work! Check it out. I got some info for the streets, man. Hot off the wires. Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa and Police Chief William J. Bratton declared war on city street gangs today, saying they will... -There you go. That's him. -...use the same tactics that crippled the Mafia to pursue gang leaders and their members. Police will begin issuing... Tell your little busted-ass homey I'm looking for him. So what up? Man, I got good news. I got bad news. The good news is I found out who got Junior. The bad news, I found out who got Junior. -Who? -Big Meat. Word on the street, man, you papered up. Say you got $100,000 stashed somewhere. That little job you've got at that security, that shit just a front. Said he struck gold when he found out Junior was your kid. I told that nigga before I got out I ain't got no more of that money. He don't believe you. He want the whole $100,000 in exchange for Junior by Friday, midnight. How the fuck am I supposed to come up with $100,000 by tomorrow? I don't know, man. But if you don't give it to him, he gonna start chopping on Junior. O, if you've got that money, man, you gotta give it up. Lucky, you think I be doing security if I had $100,000, bro? All I know is if you ain't got that money, then you better find it. Quick. All right. I'm gonna have his money by tomorrow. You get word to that nigga. When he gets that money, Junior better walk. Tell him to try me. So then, what's your next move? I take Meat out and go get my son. You can't even get near him. I can get near anybody. No. Trust me. I used to run for the Outlaws. I know what I'm talking about. If you really want your son, you need to get that money. All right. I got a plan. I need you in on it with me, though. I don't know you. You said you wanna get out of the life, right? You want out, right? Roll with me on this. You're not hearing me. You're not understanding what I'm saying. Fucking with them is suicide. Trust me on this. I got you. All right. I'm in if we hit P-Money, too. I'll take half, so I can disappear. -P-Money? -Yeah. I don't have a problem with P-Money. Yeah, well, I do. How much do you know about P-Money's operation? Everything. I know for a fact that Meat's trying to take over his territory, and P ain't having it. They're going head-to-head right now. And you know what? Meat hit one of P-Money's spots the other night. I know P's looking to retaliate. All right. I got us something. But Coco? Yeah. If they find out what I'm doing, my son is dead. So it's either all or nothing. I'm all in. Yeah? Gucci pumps, Prada panties, Fendi body bag. -Hey, girl. -Hey, mama. You got something for me today? Today I'm not selling. I'm buying. All right. But he can't come up in here. I don't know him. Come on, girl. This is my new baby. He wants to spend some moneys on me. Mmm-hmm. Come on. -How you doing? -How you? Damn. I guess we ain't gotta go to the mall no more. What can I help y'all with today? Just looking to buy my boo a few little things, you know. We got a little event coming up. Wanna make sure she's jazzy. Well, what did you have in mind? Well, what you got? Right here I have a little Versace. Over here. Right here we have a little Gucci. A little Valentino. Over in this corner, I have Kevan Hall, which is my favorite designer, his new collection. Right up them steps I have a little Phat Farm, Sean John and some Baby Phat. You going to like something, girl. All right. I'm gonna let you all be. Where's your bathroom? I gotta shit. Uh-uh. Girl, he's impossible sometimes. You know I don't play all that niggas all up in my house, taking shits... Hey, you know that I know. It's just he's got some moneys and he wants to spend it on me. I understand. A little money is good. Oh, these are real cute. -Looking all Grecian and shit. -Brand new, girl. -I'll give you a good price on that. -It's my size, too. You know, the girls done ran all through here already. Fuck! -Open the safe. -What the fuck is going on, man? -What the fuck is this, man? -Open the safe. Shut up. Get your ass down. You know whose money you're fucking with? Yeah. Tell him P-Money came to collect his rent. Tell P-Money that Big Meat, he gonna bury that ass. Shut the fuck up and open the safe! I just love these shoes. I just feel like once I've been in them for a couple hours, though, I'm gonna feel like I wanna kill myself. Sometimes you gotta suffer, girl. I mean, you know what they say, "Beauty is pain." What do you think about this dress? We'll take it. As a matter of fact, we'll take all this shit. Damn, nigga. You know who you're fucking with? You know what? Somebody else asked me the same question earlier. What? We hit P-Money's spot and make him think it's Meat. Then we hit Meat's spot and make him think it's P-Money. They start going at it, we run up out of there with all their shit. I told you, I've got you, girl. Yeah? It's Double Dutch. Mookie cousin. All right. I told you I'm cold with this shit, boy. You better not play. She over there getting your ass waxed now. Fuck it, you're supposed to be teaching the motherfucker. -Yo. -Shit! What's up? When Mookie getting out?

No, it's broke. -Use the one upstairs. -She can't go up there. Let the bitch use the bathroom. It's Mookie's cousin. Go ahead. Shit! See what you made me do? You distracted me, motherfucker. Too bad. You've got three more lives. Don't trip. This shit is real, I mean it. Who's all down there? It's about six of them. Three little niggas and three hood rats. Do something then, homey. You about to get sliced. -Fucking dagger in your back. -I'm supposed to get shot. No, homey, I got the knife out right now, so I'm gonna take that to your throat. Nigga, don't bring a knife to a gunfight, my... Don't even try it! Payback from Big Meat. Like, "She was fine. Let her go upstairs. That's Mookie's cousin." Now look at us, stupid. Can't wait till I tell P-Money about this shit. Oh, shit. Look, look, look, look, look, look. Oh, shit! -We gotta get up out of here. -What the fuck is this? There's way too many police around here. Damn. This shit's like a whole another world. Why? You ain't never been to the Sunset Strip? Nope. Never had no reason to come. You wasn't at least curious about this? I grew up in the foster system. I used to dream that someone from Hollywood would come one day and they'd rescue me and all that shit, but no one ever came. Fuck it, then. By that time I was, like, "I don't care. I don't need Hollywood." Shit. I'm gonna find something better than this anyways. -Yeah, right. -Yeah, okay. What, you wish you were a world traveler 'cause you done been to the pen and back? Shit is crazy up here, man. Damn. Some nice houses. Yeah, what up, man? About time you answered your phone. -Where you at? -Busy. You getting money? Yeah, something like that. Shit. You better, man. You gonna have it by tomorrow? I don't know, man. We'll see. I'm out here trying to do what I can. And these streets ain't no joke, dawg. Look here. Just give me a holler if you need something, man. I'm out here doing my thing, so... Hey, Lucky, let me call you right back, boy. Did you see that? The limo? Yeah, there's a lot of rich folks up here... No, he looked like he was leaving town. -So? -So we need us a spot we can lay low in. Can't keep driving around with all this jewelry and money in the car. Yeah, but how do you know there's not still family back up in that house? Because if somebody was in the house, they'd have came out to kiss him goodbye or something. I think I can disarm it. How do you know? Because I used to do security. Was that before or after you went to jail? After. And now you're breaking into folks' homes. -Man. -Shit. Green. Got it. Oh, shit. What? I think I cut the wrong cable. -I'm gonna go start the car. -Wait, hold on! I got it. I got it. Come on. Hey. What are you doing? Wait right here, okay? Come on. Damn! Goddamn. Excuse the mess. I let my maid go home. I could really get used to some shit like this. Let's count this money. Shit. Damn. Must have set off the alarm. Where are you going? I got this. Just watch this, wait. Go. -Hello. -Mrs. Bennett? No, I'm sorry. There is no Mrs. Bennett. Oh, sorry. I forgot about the alarm. Bad habit. Do you know the security code, ma'am? Yes, I do. -It's 9... -No, don't tell us. Could you activate and then deactivate the alarm for us, please? Sure. Having a little trouble, sister? I'm so bad at these electronic things. He's always getting mad at me for it. Mind if we step in for a moment? Ray, check the back. Mr. Bennett is in Paris for a couple days. Exactly what is your relationship with Mr. Bennett? I'm his assistant. I'm gonna be housesitting while he's gone. You know, it makes me feel really safe that the cops respond so quickly. I'm gonna be here alone for a couple days, and I get kind of nervous. And so, if I see anything that maybe seems suspicious or anything like that, or if I just feel like maybe I need some help, would it be all right if I called you? Can I call you personally? All clear. I'll meet you outside in a minute. Any time. Thank you. Any time. O2! O2. What happened? Well, they gone. Let's count this money. Let's count it. Thirty six thousand four hundred, five hundred, six hundred. That ain't nowhere near enough for Junior. Look at these keys. Look. A-F-S-L. Wait, this is a safe deposit box key, right? America's First Savings and Loan? Right? What else could that stand for? What does that say? B-O-T-P. Bank of the People. This is from... This must mean Crenshaw Savings and Loan. Good morning, L.A. It is your girl Yo-Yo, and today is the day that we will be covering the city-wide protest live, where residents from over a dozen South Los Angeles communities will be taking to the streets. We are downtown, where the battle cry "Save Our Streets" will ring out not only here, but throughout the city. Meet me today at Leimert Park. Excuse me. May I help you?

Save our streets! Save our streets! Save our streets! Save our streets! Save our streets! Save our streets! Save our streets! Anybody move, I'm gonna blow the weave off this bitch's head! No! A cunning couple robbed the America's First Savings and Loan this morning. The female member of the duo... A second bank was hit today in South LA. A masked man entered the Bank of the People branch on Western Avenue and held a woman at gunpoint while emptying an unknown amount from the bank's safe deposit box. We're up to $45,000 apiece. So I guess we gotta figure out a way to get rid of this. No more drugs! This is our neighborhood. Come on! Speak. -What's going on, man? -Hey, where you at, man? Around. Can y'all please get the fuck out the way? Damn! Problem? All these "We Shall Overcome" motherfuckers marching, holding up traffic and shit. Hey, look here, playboy. I heard you out here, all scraping up some serious paper. I'm thinking you should let me get in on that, man. No, man. Stakes are too high. But I need you to put me in touch with somebody, get rid of these diamonds. Well, I can unload that. No, no, no. No way. You gonna punk out on me, man? What, I ain't good enough or something, now that you're going around with your little breezy? You gonna get money with her before you get money with your own people? Every time I've ever asked you to do something, you drop the ball. Look, man, this here is for Junior, and I gotta do what I gotta do for the little man. Can't do it. O, family. Listen. If you fuck this up... I won't. I won't. I'm gonna find out where to unload the shit, and it's all good. Now look here, man. You need to get the fuck up off these streets, man. You way too hot. When I find something I'm gonna holler back at you and then I'll come meet you where you at. -All right? -All right. -All right. I'm gone. -Go on. He want us to wait right here. Save our streets! Y'all need to get out the streets. That's how you save the streets. Before it's too late, save our streets! We have a right to our streets. We are being gunned down. We have a right to...

Hey, what you all... -Pull over, nigga! -This ain't no game, man. -What the fuck, nigga? -Pull this raggedy motherfucker over! Right now! Mildred Thompson was a friend of mine. And now I struggle to find the words to tell my son... -Get out! -...what happened to his friend. He hears on the news about the war on terror while we're being terrorized right here in our streets. He hears about the vast amount of money being spent on homeland security, but this neighborhood is our homeland, and where is our security? -Get your hands off of me, fool! -Shut your ass up. Shut the fuck up. Shut up. You dodging me, nigga? -Ain't nobody dodging you. -You don't answer my page. You must be running the Outlaws now. There you go with that shit. I gave you weight to sell, not to get high with. Where's my money, nigga? Man, my baby mama been tripping, man. She gonna take me to court, right? So I have... I don't give a fuck about your baby mama or none of that horseshit! I want my money tomorrow. Tomorrow, nigger. We have to take back our neighborhood and save our streets! Save our streets! Save our streets! Save our streets! Save our streets! Save our streets! We're coming to you live from Leimert Park, where the Mayor will be up next, addressing the crowd of several thousand people. Police have confirmed that a string of gang-operated businesses have been robbed. And it appears these robberies have further fanned the flames of a raging turf war between two of L.A.'s most notorious kingpins. Details of the robberies are unknown at this time. Be so glad when this shit is over with. God willing, you'll have Junior by tonight. What you all gonna do afterwards? I know I need to get my son out of here. I'm done with this bullshit. How about you? Don't really have any plans. Just a fantasy. -Yeah? -Yeah. When I used to live in all those different homes I used to take travel magazines and I'd cut all the pictures out, and I would fantasize that I was there. And everybody used to think I was crazy, but I didn't really care, 'cause I felt like I had been all over the world. Just 'cause I ain't been to the Sunset Strip don't mean I don't wanna travel. So when you get your money, where you gonna go? There's this spot I read about. It's on the coast of Mexico. It's called El Lindo. And they say that there's magic there in the ground. Everything you do is blessed. All your past is buried. And all your pain is forgotten. That's where I wanna go. I want you to have something. What? We don't need to let this one go. Take this with you to Mexico. How's it look on me? It's beautiful. Thanks. I just think of so many more things I could be doing to find my son. Listen to me. Listen to me. There is nothing else you can do right now, except for wait for Lucky to call. Junior's gonna be fine. Listen to me. Junior's gonna be fine. Okay? All right. Okay. -I can't do this right now. -Come here. In an unusual story, three banks were robbed today by an unidentified man and woman. It has been impossible to determine what the robbers have taken because the items stolen were taken from safe deposit boxes. The police are investigating leads and are confident that the perpetrators will be apprehended. However, bank officials have stated the robberies appear to have been well planned. I want those motherfuckers. Shit is all my fault. O, don't do this to yourself. You know all that money that Big Meat is after? I took it. What? Me and Meat did a job. He tried to short me. So I took what was mine. He found out about it, set me up. I went to the pen. He thought he knew where I stashed my take, but I moved it. He started looking for it. He started getting closer.
