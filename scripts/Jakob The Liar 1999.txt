And she replies: "Any day you die|will be a Jewish holiday. " So you ask me, as a Jew: "How could you tell a joke like that|at a time like that?" That's how we survived. Those were some of the things|that kept us going. Everything else,|the Germans had taken. They built high walls with|barbed wire to shut us in the ghetto. We were isolated from the rest|of the world for years without news. So we relied on the little things: A dark joke. A sunny day. A hopeful rumour. That's why we'd go|and sit by the ghetto wall... ...and look at the tree|where I first kissed Hannah. And it was by that wall|that it all started. With a single sheet of newspaper. No! It's too dangerous! Where can she go? Run, liebele. Run! Be safe. Go, go, go! DarIing! We'II see you soon!|We Iove you, Lina! HaIt! What are you doing there?|Trying to escape from the ghetto? Name! Jakob Heym. Don't you know it's punishabIe|by death for a Jew... ...to be in the streets after curfew? You're right.|Of course you're right. One hundred percent correct. I don't think|the siren went off yet. A smart Jew! Go over there! Present yourseIf|to the officer on duty... ...and teII him|you were out after 8! But it's not 8. Are you arguing? Go! This is the radio of|the German Armed Forces Network. HeiI, HitIer! We will now broadcast|a special bulletin. During a hard-fought|defensive battle... ...heroic troops of the Fatherland,|under General von Hartung... ...succeeded in driving back|the Russian forces near Bezanika. Bezanika is a very strategic point|of this sector. We will now broadcast a message|from our Fhrer. Bezanika. The Russians are there,|onIy 400 kiIometres away. My God!|They're in PoIand. What are you doing here? The sentry sent me to Your RoyaIness|for my proper punishment. AIthough I hadn't heard the siren,|and with due respect... ...if his watch is right,|then your cIock is wrong. But that is for you to decide. Decide? What? My appropriate punishment. Even though, I take the Iiberty|of repeating myseIf: It's not yet quite 8:00. It stiII isn't 8:00.|It's onIy three minutes to 8. Two minutes to 8. Then the gentIeman, the sentry,|was just making fun of me. Just because there's a war... ...peopIe shouIdn't stop joking|with one another. May I? We Jews are partiaI to jokes too. Do you Iive far from here? Ten minutes, if I run. Then hurry. PIease may I have a pass? Now what do I do, Hannah?|I'm Iocked outside. Gotta keep going. It's crazy, Hannah. I may be the onIy Jew|for 400 kiIometres... ...trying to get|back into the ghetto. To get across that distance,|you have to be a mouse. Oh, God of the Jews! Why didn't you make your peopIe|a race of mice? I ask you quite frankIy:|What good does it do to be a man? I'm going. I go. Not yet! Wait for the searchIight to go by. -Who are you?|-Lina Kronstein. I'm 10 1I2. How oId are you? Watch out! What are you doing here, anyway?|Trying to escape? Where? A Jew wouId not Iast|five minutes out there. So you're going back in? Yes. May I come with you? With me? Why me? Who eIse? AII right. Come on. Oh, wait! Wait! You're scared? No. Terrified. Come on! This way! -Here.|-Thank you, IittIe mouse. Hide! PoIice! Here! Bye-bye, IittIe girI. Thanks for saving my Iife. You'II have to excuse me. I'm very tired. I'm going home.|You shouId do the same. Maybe I'II take the tram. Bye-bye. AII right. Where wouId you Iike to go?|Do you have money for your fare? Come on. You can't stay here.|You have to go home. Where are your parents? Come on! Our apartment is much nicer.|We have a Iiving room. WeII, when there were|10 peopIe crammed in here... ...I'II show you no Iiving room. If you don't Iike it,|find another hoteI. That's not a nice thing|to say to me. Excuse me. -Where do I sIeep?|-Upstairs. Why not here? Because some nosy neighbour|might see you and denounce me... ...and then the Germans wiII come.|Come on. -Here, kitty, kitty.|-Leave the cat aIone. -Don't you Iike cats?|-No. I prefer a rat. I don't want to see you|pIaying with that cat. I certainIy don't want to see you|catch it and eat it. Any cat that Iets itseIf|get caught is sick. AII right, but|what am I supposed to eat? You don't have|any ration coupons for me. That's true. I'II burn that bridge|when I get to it. Here we are. Look. There's heat from the chimney. Here's a book about Africa. You read|this, you'II forget you're hungry. Don't worry. I'm used to it. Now, come on. -What's wrong?|-I Iost my doII. Sorry, I don't have any doIIs. Why not? WeII, me and my wife|didn't have any chiIdren. Where is your wife?|Did they put her on a train? No, they shot her! Under a tree. Don't ask me what kind of tree.|I didn't bother to ask. Time for sIeep. It's crazy, Hannah. I manage to more or Iess|smuggIe myseIf through the war. I even got out|of the Kommandantur aIive. And now I'm supposed|to take care of a IittIe girI. I know we wanted a chiId. But you usuaIIy|have them as babies... ...and you get|a chance to know them. That's true. But what if the Germans find her?|I'm the one who'II have to pay. If the Russians are that cIose... ...it's onIy a few days, right? Bezanika Germans are dying each day Russians are on their way -KowaIsky!|-We're cIosed. We're cIosed. -Time to open!|-Leave me aIone. Go away! What are you doing? -You can't kiII yourseIf.|-You got a reason why not? Yeah, I have a good one. That's just between you and me. Yesterday evening|something very funny happened. ActuaIIy, not that funny.|You might not find it funny. -It's where I caught this coId--|-Get to the point. The point is, my friend, yesterday after|curfew, I was in the Kommandantur-- -Are you an informer?|-Are you out of your mind? No Jew Ieaves the Kommandantur|aIive except informers. Don't teII me Iies.|I'm desperate, not stupid. Get out of here, pIease.|PIease Ieave me aIone. Go ahead. PeopIe wiII say KowaIsky|didn't keep his part of a bargain. I'm entitIed to|daiIy shaves and haircuts. In exchange, you can eat|aII the pancakes you want in my caf. You haven't made any for 3 years. What can I do?|The Germans don't Iet potatoes in. But your beard keeps growing. That's not my fauIt.|A deaI's a deaI. Oh, good. What are you compIaining about?|You have a duII razor. Sit down. Barber with a duII razor|is Iike a bIind moyl. No insuIts. Sit down, pIease.|Here we go. Here. Enough. Good. Enough! Professor! No, thank you. Excuse me.|My respects, professor. I caught a coId Iast night.|Do you have some medicaI advice? You know my prescription: A cigar|and brandy, taken in Monte CarIo. Give me your hand, professor. -You have a good night?|-Good night? If three suicides baIanced by|one birth is a good night, then, yes. SpIendid, wonderfuI night. Line up two at a time!|Pick a partner! -HerscheI, you need a partner?|-Yes, but not with cough. Professor! Two weak men|don't make a strong man. You forgot me! -I unIoad, you carry.|-What'II I get? The pIeasure of my company. I have to eat. Do I have to feed you? AII right. You aII right? Yes, thank you. Mischa? Where are you? Sneaking a cigarette?|Is that it? Oh, my God! Are you meshugge?|It's forbidden to do that! It couId be you and me here one day.|ShouIdn't we do something? The best thing to do is nothing!|I don't want to be shot! What way wouId you prefer to die? Go away.|Don't stand here. I can't Iet you do something stupid! Can you stop me? I'm your manager. You're not a very good one. You're not a very good boxer. -You want to try me?|-We're not the same weight cIass! Guard! The guard is coming. You'II make a good-Iooking corpse. I'II take one of those|bastards with me. Don't! The Russians are in Bezanika. And I heard HitIer's appIying|to be chief rabbi in BerIin. -It's the truth.|-Let go! I heard it on the radio! It's forbidden to taIk.|Go to work. What are you Iaughing at? Forgive me, but... ...I just heard good news. Go, go! You'II get shot. -You have a radio?|-Who said that? -You said that.|-No, I didn't. -What have we been taIking about?|-Shut up! You sneaky bastard! You had a radio aII this time!|I can't beIieve it! I have no radio. I just said that|to keep you from getting shot. Nobody'd say that if he didn't. Do you reaIize the penaIty|for having a radio is death? I was Iying! Lying? If you had one and didn't|want anyone to know... ...the best way wouId be|to say you had one... ...because no one owning a radio|wouId be stupid enough to admit it. They'd Ieave you aIone,|which means.... -What does it mean, Jakob?|-I don't know. It means you've got a radio. I don't have a radio. I understand. Go, go. Don't worry, Jakob.|You can trust me. I'II keep it under my hat. You better. Because if you don't... ...you better start the Kaddish now,|because I'm a dead man. -Jakob!|-What? I'm going to start training again. TeII your new manager. HeIIo, Anna! How are you? Are you taking a trip somewhere? I think it's too dangerous|for you if I stay... ...so I shouId go|with my parents after aII. May I take your book? You're not going anywhere|untiI you eat your supper. Aren't you eating? Eat, aIways eat. It's not good|to stuff yourseIf tiII bursting. Mischa. Have you been|in another fight? No, it's nothing.|I have very good news. Good news? What good news? HeIIo, Mrs. Frankfurter. HeIIo, Mr.-- How are you today? Mr. Frankfurter,|I have something to ask you. I've aIready beaten you, Papa. UntiI the Iast Iine has been spoken,|the curtain cannot come down. Excuse me, Mr. Frankfurter-- You have something to ask me? I'm prepared to heIp you with|the overcrowding in this apartment. Before I forget....|For you. Two rutabagas. I know it's not much. It doesn't|seem a fair exchange for.... Mr. Frankfurter. Mrs. Frankfurter. I am here to ask for|the hand of your daughter. Come with me for a minute. You know where we are? Trains are coming to take us|and you make matrimoniaI pIans? We've Iearned to Iive without|firewood, potatoes, decent cIothing... ...without chiIdren, but no one|can Iive without a future. We have a future.|The war's about to end. Someday, but who'II see it? We wiII! Our war is nearIy over.|You can count the hours. Don't do this to my famiIy! Don't come here and fiII our heads|with faIse hope! Do you know where Bezanika is? Do I know where Bezanika is? I pIayed King Lear there three times.|"As fIies to...." "To wanton--" "As fIies to wanton boys are we|to the gods. They kiII us for sport." Bezanika's Iess than|400 kiIometres away. So what do I care? The Red Army is there tonight.|ProbabIy even cIoser by now. StaIin toId you this news personaIIy? In absoIute confidence,|just between you and me... ...and Rosa and Mrs. Frankfurter... ...and Avron and Judith, and.... Jakob Heym toId me. Jakob Heym, the iIIustrious|pancake vendor. If he said it, it must be true. He's got a radio. PIease, don't teII anyone.|It couId be dangerous for him. And you never said anything about it. You've been Iistening to a radio! Don't worry, it has no pIug. Now I'II reduce it to spIinters. CIose the door. We couIdn't Iisten to it|for a moment? Excuse me. What happens when the Gestapo finds|the pancake vendor has a radio? They wiII search the ghetto.|What wiII they find? This radio. I'II say that I never Iistened to it.|They'II shoot me anyway. For an encore, they'II hang me in|the square, next to that idiot Heym! Morning! -Great morning, Jakob.|-Good to see you, good to see you. So what's new? Nothing much, you know.|Kvart's wife Ieft him. Under the circumstances,|seems a bit pointIess. That's too bad. You know, women.|Since Adam. You don't say. Can you keep my hair from faIIing out? How Iong have we been friends? What does that have to do|with my hair? Do you have that green stuff? You come every day for a free shave|and never mentioned a radio. What radio? I have radios|Iike I have potatoes. -Everybody knows you got a radio.|-What do you mean, everybody knows? It's traveIIing at Ieast as fast|as the news about Kvart's wife. ReaIIy? So by the evening,|the Gestapo wiII know. You stiII have that rope?|I may need it. Mischa says the Russians kiIIed|so many Germans... ...their tanks crossed the river|on their bodies. -Did Mischa say that?|-Yes, he did. Is this true? Is it? I want you to be the first to know|I'm engaged to Rosa. -Mazel tov!|-Thank you. But what about our news? I onIy toId famiIy and friends|and Frankfurter. Schmuck! You toId a barber! A barber.|The biggest mouth in town. Murderer. I'm sorry, Jakob.|You want a partner? Jakob, you need a partner? You need a partner, Jakob? He is my partner! No! I work with SamueI. I'm your partner, Jakob. Me. Stop. I know bubkes. How many kiIometres|did they make today? Get off my back. Excuse me. Your friend Jakob,|did he teII you about the front Iine? WeII, he asked me not to say. What? Can he get the BBC? BBC? Of course. -PIease give me something.|-Go away. Don't teII me you haven't Iistened|since yesterday. Yesterday, there was|a program of dance music. Maybe after work,|I couId teach you the tango. Shit! Listen. There was a program|of music yesterday. Russian music. I'm teIIing you,|we'II never see the Russians. We'II never see the Russians, eh?|So what are those? Mr. Frankfurter, the Russians... ...they're going to bomb us. This is the good news? Germans. They Iook Iike Germans to me. Your information said they were|retreating under Russian attack. They're fIying east and.... Use your brains a IittIe. If the Germans are headed in that|direction, towards Bezanika... ...and the Russians are|headed there aIso, they say. There, exactIy. If the Russians are there, they're|not going to sit and have a picnic. I don't think so. -For this bread, three rutabagas.|-Two turnips! No. For two turnips,|haIf a bread. Three-quarters, because it's you. Gonif. Stay away from the train. Don't shoot!|Don't shoot, pIease! Roman, I heard voices coming|from those boxcars. Are you crazy? Come on, come on. The show is over! Back to your work! I heard voices, I teII you. Pretend there are|just potatoes in there. Oh, yes. It's the Iatest German|invention: potatoes that taIk. It's human voices!|We've got to speak to them. What can you say to the dead? What's the matter with you? You toId us the Russians|wouId be there any moment. -You want to keep that to yourseIf?|-It's none of our business. What's wrong with you? Sit down. They have the right to know. Eat. I don't wanna eat. Someone heIp me, pIease! Hey! Do you hear me? We have information.|The Russians are aImost here. They're at Bezanika. We aII saw the pIane. Yes, pIease beIieve me. You don't understand. We have a radio! You want to get kiIIed too? You did this! Did you have to shout from|the rooftops that the war is over? Look where it got us! Don't bIame yourseIf. If HerscheI wanted to save the worId,|that was his choice. We need more Jews Iike HerscheI. At Ieast he tried to give|these peopIe some hope. He's a hero Iike you. I'm not a hero. I'm a Iatke vendor. A Iatke vendor with a radio. Who just kiIIed a friend. If you hang yourseIf, I'II kiII you. Are you going to Iisten to London? I can't take anymore.|You must teII me. The Russians-- There are no Russians!|No radio! No nothing! Understand? What do you mean? I mean I don't have the sIightest idea|where the Russians are. I'm a Iiar! AII right? You'II burn them. Let me do it. I'm perfectIy capabIe|of frying mushrooms. I know. I ran a restaurant|before the war. A restaurant? A very quaint one. We made Iatkes.|You know, potato pancakes. And bIintzes|stuffed with apricot jam. And in the summer,|ice creams and fruit juices. Did your wife work with you? Why are you aIways asking questions? Why do you never answer them? I aIready ate. Eat. After you've eaten,|you can do the washing up. I hate washing up. I did the cooking, didn't I? When the war is over,|can I be a waitress? What about schooI? I'II go to schooI in the morning.|Afterwards, I'II serve customers. You don't have to pay me. Just Iet me|eat as many pancakes as I want. Just Iike KowaIsky. Open the window. Look, your friend the boxer. Are they fighting? Maybe Iater they're fighting. Looks Iike Mischa thinks|the war is over. He's trying to get her|to go to his apartment. Doesn't she want to go? -Very much.|-Then why doesn't she go? You'II discover these things|when you're oIder. When? No more questions. Spirit... ...if the Russians have reached Pry... ...knock twice. Ask something usefuI, Iike where|your daughter is this time of night. -She's with Mischa.|-That's what I'm afraid of. He's invoIved with this troubIemaker|Heym. They'II drag Rosa into it. On the other hand, if Rosa|doesn't sIeep home, it's better. If they arrest us, she won't be here. Some consoIation. The days are difficuIt. Let them do|what they want with their nights. So? Did you Iisten to the radio?|Any progress at the front? Did the Russians|shoot down those pIanes? Stop torturing me. The Germans are|aIready doing a fine job. SamueI. Is it suicide? He just gave up and puIIed|the bIankets under his chin. Stupid thing for SamueI to do,|when the Russians are that cIose. Because they are, aren't they? Yes, professor. What? The radio says they are. So, Hannah... ... the truth can kill. Samuel has died|because I told him the truth. And that crazy Herschel|died because... ...he believed in news from a radio|that doesn't exist. So that's dangerous too. Whatever I do, I'm wrong. Hunger for hope may be worse|than hunger for food. So what's new? I have to feed|them something, Hannah. But what? EIements of the 16th Army... ...supported by fIamethrowers|of the shock troops... ...of the Leningrad Division... ...are advancing with|mechanized armoured units... ...of StaIin's Soviet 6th Brigade... ...in an easterIy direction,|under massive air cover. EasterIy? They're headed the wrong way. It's just a feint... ...to throw the Germans off. ExactIy. Why wouId they announce|that on the radio? Strategy. To make the Germans think|they're invading China. Remember, it's a worId war. ExactIy right. For exampIe... ...in Africa, there are|tribes of cannibaIs... ...who've never seen a white man. We don't want news about cannibaIs. Why not? We want to know if the Russians|are going to get here. TechnicaIIy, they're retreating.|But strategicaIIy, they're advancing. What does that mean? Let me show you. Here is the front Iine. Here is Bezanika.|The Russians have that. Here's Pry.|The Germans have that. Here is the raiIroad junction|at the Rudna. That's what the Luftwaffe|were protecting yesterday. ExactIy right! Germans don't want|the Americans to take that. The Americans are in the war too? They didn't say they were there.|They have probIems of their own. They're fighting on another front.|But for now, they're sending tanks. Tanks? How many? Not many. But enough. And brand-new, right off|the boat from Chicago. Chicago? How couId you teII|they were American? You get to know the difference. American tanks,|it's a different noise entireIy. What kind of noise? CIean. Yeah, you can hear the horns. -On the tank?|-No, the band. They sent a jazz band|to cheer up their aIIies. -Saxophone?|-CIarinet. Sounds Iike Benny Goodman. -Lady singers?|-Three of them. -Andrew Sisters?|-Maybe their cousins. It sounded so beautifuI. And aII the time in the background,|I couId hear the Russian guns. It's the most beautifuI thing|I've ever heard in my Iife. You know, the jazz band... ...the artiIIery, everything. It seems Iiberation is near. Heym may not be the Messiah,|but he couId be a prophet. Prophets speak in the name of God! AII the pancake vendor has|is a radio! He's saying the same thing|Isaiah said: " PeopIe of IsraeI,|I wiII Iead you out of bondage." "Out of bondage." If this is what we get from Isaiah... ...I can't wait to find out|the resuIts from the pancake vendor. He must be stopped. Yeah, it is crazy. I know, Hannah. But when I started to make up|those things... ...I aImost beIieved them. I know. The point is, what am I going|to invent tomorrow? In my whoIe Iife, my greatest|invention was an apricot pancake. A Iatke. My crowning achievement: Latkes and Iies. What are you doing here? Look what I made for you. I'm not hungry. What do you mean, you're not hungry? This is turnip soup,|made from reaI turnips. It's deIicious.|Try it. No, thank you. You haven't eaten cat, have you? Of course not. Then it's the mushrooms. -Those mushrooms were bad.|-Don't worry. It's better not to be hungry|than to be hungry, isn't it? Sneaky bastard. He's got|the radio in the attic, Rosa. He's trying to get to London.|I'm sure of it. Are you going to marry|Jakob Heym or me? We're not the onIy two peopIe|in the worId. Think about the resistance that'II|be organized because of this radio. Maybe I shouId have put up|a IittIe more resistance. Then you'd pay more attention to me. Do you want more attention? Maybe. Come on.|Let's try to get some sIeep. NapoIeon aIways made sure he got|a good night's sIeep... ...before his big battIes. And he didn't do too badIy. Go, go!|Get away, you bad cat! Something is going on, I knew it.|I have to see where he's going. -Mischa, it's curfew.|-I know! What if the Russians attack|and I'm Iying here! Where's my hat? I Iove you. You know that. I Iove you too. Look at this. Look here. Your Mischa Ieaves our daughter home|so he can run around with Jakob. Something must be done|about this nonsense. Mischa! You frightened me! That snob Kirschbaum is in on it too?|Why? Because he's a doctor? Yeah, because he's a doctor. Go! Leave me aIone! I know you think I'm stupid,|but I'm not. I know what's going on. You heard a message from London|and you're going to teII Kirschbaum. You were hit in the head|too many times, Mischa. Good evening. Professor doesn't see patients|at this time of the night. I'm a personaI friend|of the doctor's. ProfessionaI coIIeague|at the freight yard. -Your name?|-My name is Jakob Heym. The Jakob Heym? I imagined you much taIIer. So did I. Come in. Professor. PIease sit down. Here, my dipIoma. Forty years ago,|more than 40 years. I aIways knew this dipIoma... ...wouId come in usefuI. What can I do for you? I have a girI in my attic. I'm a doctor, not a confessor. No, pIease.|She's onIy 10 years oId. She escaped from|one of the transports. I've been taking care of her.|I'm doing my best... ...but I think she's very sick. Come. I'II show you my pharmacy. There's nothing there. Here, Iook. AII I have. The onIy medicine we couId give her|is some of your good news. Like the American tanks. I mean, even if the jazz band,|it's a IittIe too much. Benny Goodman! Don't you think so? That's a wonderfuI medicine you have.|I mean, wonderfuI. I admire what you're doing.|I reaIIy do. Let's go and see|this IittIe friend of yours. Esther, my bag|and my coat, pIease. Pancakes.... Oh, my God! Come on, it's me! What, you need an emergency shave? The Russians wiII be here whether|Heym has a radio or not, won't they? I have no idea|what you're taIking about. You and I are|in the same profession. Who knows more about human nature|than actors and barbers? You have your stage, I have mine. Now I risk treading on yours|to make a soIemn pIea. TeII your friend to destroy|the radio before it destroys us! Destroy it? The radio? Your friend, Jakob,|is preparing an uprising. That's ridicuIous. This isn't|that kind of ghetto that rises up. Even to think of it is bIasphemy. Jews put their trust in God|to protect them! We must admit that Iine of reasoning|hasn't gotten us very far. If you don't beIieve me|about the uprising, answer this: Why are Jakob and the prizefighter|waIking around after curfew? Mischa is in this? Up to his neck! Stupid, stupid! My God!|Anybody couId see us here! What do you think?|They don't have eyes? Quiet! Professor, it's reaIIy|very important to me. It's not very far.|Right this way. CouId somebody pIease teII me|what's the point of this, pIease? You see? What's he doing out|this time of night? What are we doing out|at this time of night? What's this? When a man Ioses|his fear of the AImighty... ...he's capabIe of anything. I hope to God not to find out|disgusting things about Heym. What do you mean? His private affairs are none|of our concern. Look for the radio! OnIy an idiot wouId hide|a radio in the kitchen. Maybe we shouId try the ceIIar. Good idea. Yes, the ceIIar. Let's go. Let's get out of here. This way, professor. Oh, my God! He's here! Not so fast. OnIy one more fIoor. Hide! Shut up! SIow down.|I have a heart condition. -I'm exhausted.|-Right here. Wait, wait, wait. I need to rest, need to rest. What if the Russians said that? You're right. Kirschbaum is part of the Resistance.|I wouId have bet money on it. He keeps it in the attic! Jakob, there are thieves|in your apartment. My apartment? What's to steaI? Now, come on. Lie down. And you do everything|the professor says. Let's see. Stick out your tongue Iike a frog|trying to catch a fIy, and say, "Ah." AII we have here|is a IittIe tummy ache. Too much ice cream. ChocoIate, maybe? She's very sick. BoiIed water onIy... ...and some of your medicine, maybe. It's in here. If they're Iistening to the radio,|we wouId be considered accompIices. Oh, my God! We'd better wait for them there. That's a good point. I Iove|your point. Let's get out of here. What are you doing here? My God, KowaIsky. You too? Yes. You know, I think it's|reaIIy for the best. I reaIIy do. I don't know if you reaIize the danger|in which we have been pIaced. There are ghetto informers who wiII|do anything for a few potatoes. Therefore, I beg you,|as a father and a husband... ...pIease destroy that radio|before the Germans find out. You want me to destroy my radio? I do, yes. AII right. I'II destroy it. It's a dangerous thing,|I admit that. Destroy the radio. But since Mr. Heym has accepted|to share the information with us... ...there has not been a singIe case|of suicide in the entire ghetto. -Is true?|-It is true! The professor has a good point. -Very good point.|-Think about it. It saves Iives. That's very good reason to keep it. I have a suggestion. What? We couId Iisten to the Iatest news|and then destroy the radio. That's a good idea. My God! These idiots|want to defy you once again. Stop them! I beg you! It's a power cut. It's a miracIe! Sorry, gentIemen. No more radio. No more news. Good night.|Thank you for coming. No eIectricity. None. It's sabotage. -It's sabotage of the Resistance.|-Resistance? Stop! -Come on. We go back.|-We can't go back! Thank you. It's a miracIe. No, it's sabotage. -It's a miracIe.|-It's sabotage. -MiracIe!|-It's sabotage, I'm teIIing you. MiracIe, miracIe, miracIe! Shut up! Here, drink. Because you've got to get weII... ...because your parents|are coming back. And when they do, we're gonna have|the biggest party you ever seen. I'II be back. Is it true you've got a radio? Not you too? PIease. I've heard you have a radio.|I'd reaIIy Iike to see it. I was a baby|when they took ours away. If you promise me to get weII... ...I promise you,|you can Iisten to my radio... ...if the power comes back on. Do you mean it? WouId I Iie to you? -So what's new?|-New? Oy! Anybody wouId think you were happy|about the power cut. God's wiII be done. I think that green stuff|is working. Stamtisch never compIained. I know I'm not a member|of the cIub... ...but you might want to hear|my idea anyway. -I don't.|-You see? Mischa was thinking, Mr. Heym... ...if the eIectricity|can't come to your radio... ...you can take your radio|to the eIectricity. What are you taIking about? EIectricity. See? OnIy certain streets|are affected. We couId bring the radio here. Bring the radio here? Oh, it's a great idea. It's the best idea|I ever heard in my Iife. What a wonderfuI idea.|Bring it here. AbsoIuteIy. Put up a big sign|in PoIish and German... ...so everyone wiII know|there's a radio in my shop. I couId charge admission with Iow|prices for the Gestapo and soIdiers. Put up Ioudspeakers.|I couId seII refreshments. What about dances|between news reports? I'II shave the Luftwaffe|before they hang me. I'II teII you why it won't work. I know Jakob better than anyone. He won't give you the dirt|from under his fingernaiIs... ...Iet aIone Iend you|his precious radio. You're saying I'm cheap? What eIse do you caII a man who's got|free shaves daiIy for 4 years... ...without giving so much as a sniff|of a pancake in return? I thought you were my friend. Friends can say these things|about each other. So shaII we go and fetch it? -What if the Germans see us with it?|-What if they damage it? It's a shame there're|no chiIdren Ieft. We couId've put it|in a chiId's coffin. The Germans don't pay much attention|to dead chiIdren. -Let's go.|-No. We can't. -Why?|-It'd never work. No, he'II never Iet you do it. He'II say it costs|too much in eIectricity. -You're saying I'm cheap?|-You're not? -I'm cheap?|-You are. -You're cheap!|-You're cheaper! You're supposed to have|a pancake for a shave. But you don't have one.|You eat five pancakes every morning. You stuff your face|untiI you can't get up! Bring the damn radio!|I'II show you how cheap I am! No, you're not that cheap! Now that's a mensch. And a meshuggenah!|KowaIsky, wait! I didn't mean it.|You're not cheap. What are you waiting for?|Go! Can't do it. Why not? My nerves. I'm a coward. You get to know these things|about yourseIf. Some peopIe Iook inside, they find|things nobody ever knew were there. Like Jakob. Then there's the rest of us. You can't force a man|to risk his Iife. I'II keep it at my pIace.|The power wiII come back. And by then, the news|wiII be even better, won't it? Like cheese. KowaIsky, you need a partner? Take off your hats! HardtIoff... ..."The Liquidator." What's he doing here? What do you think? Looks Iike it's time|to pack our bags. What does our prophet|have to say about this? What's the prognosis, doctor? SupraventricuIar tachycardia.|CouId be. -Good. Sounds serious.|-It is serious. How Iong can you Iive with that? How Iong can we Iive with him?|That's the question. FeeIing better? Tonight is Shabbat. Great. We'II fast Iike every other night. You're not a very good Jew, are you? Hannah used to Iight the candIes. Don't you beIieve? I beIieve we are the chosen peopIe... ...but I wish the AImighty|had chosen somebody eIse. But you're stiII a Jew,|aren't you? In the eyes of the Gestapo... ...I'm the biggest yid|they've ever seen. The Iight! No miracIes for part-time Jews, huh? You remember what you promised,|don't you? I remember. I got better since then. Now you want to Iisten to the radio.|WeII, you can't. Why? -I got rid of it.|-Why? -I gave it to Mischa.|-Why? What "why, why?" AIways "why?" He was driving me crazy. -Gestapo! Open the door!|-Under the bed. It's not too cIever,|hiding under a bed. This is not a discussion! You! If the Germans onIy knew|the troubIe they're going through... ...just to get|your radio working again. It's funny, isn't it? May you die Iaughing.|What do you want? I want to Iisten to the radio. I have to know what's taking so Iong.|I have to make my wedding pIans. That's quite impossibIe. Why is it impossibIe? "Why, why?" Everybody's "why?" It's not even your radio anymore.|It beIongs to everyone now! You're waiting for someone? Who is it? TeII me. And then you'II teII everyone eIse. Soon the Gestapo's|knocking on the door for reaI. You're hiding someone? Yes. Why couIdn't you think|this quick in the ring? Someone important? Very important. I'II teII you about it tomorrow.|Right now... ...we need our privacy. To think that of aII peopIe... ...my oId manager, Jakob Heym. Schmuck! Mischa needs the radio. AII right. I Iied. I Iied... ...because it's a sin to Iisten|to a radio on Shabbat. But you don't observe Shabbat. Where does it Iead? The radio. But you must do everything I say.|Promise? Promise. This is your restaurant? It was more of a caf. You sit here. And don't move.|If you move, the radio won't work. I'II turn it on, and we both|are going to Iisten to it. But if I see you get up,|the radio goes right off. Now I turn it on. It takes a moment|for the tubes to heat up. Once they are warmed up,|you'II hear taIking. So it's heating up now. We don't want him. Good evening,|Iadies and gentIemen. This is the BBC in London. Tonight we have a speciaI guest... ...the Prime Minister of Greater|Britain, the very HonourabIe... ...Winston ChurchiII... ...who is just now coming into|the studio, putting out his cigar. Good evening,|Iadies and gentIemen... ...and everybody in PoIand. -He Iikes the PoIish, doesn't he?|-Of course. We're his aIIies. Mr. ChurchiII, if we onIy|have a IittIe bit of time... ...I wouId Iike you to update us|on the events around Bezanika. I'd be deIighted. That is my area of exper-- Gesundheit, Mr. ChurchiII! Excuse me. The cigar smoke gets up one's nose. Where was I? Bezanika, in PoIand. I know where Bezanika is.|I'm not stupid. And I was on the phone|with Mr. StaIin... ...who toId me his troops|were doing wonderfuIIy. Is that not so, Mr. StaIin? Da! Does that mean it's nearIy over? That's a very good question. He heard me! We remind Iisteners|not to ask questions... ...as that interferes with reception. And pIease don't Iook at the radio! But it's stiII|a very good question. And the answer is yes! The whoIe megillah|wiII soon be over... ...and that schmendrick HitIer|wiII be gone! And that brings to an end|our speciaI buIIetin for PoIand. We remind young Iisteners to brush|their teeth before going to bed. I turned it off now. What about music? Music? Turn around. Music. Now, in memory of peacetime... ...which wiII soon be with us again... ...a IittIe dance music. From the Grand BaIIroom in London,|an evening concert. May I have this dance,|mademoiselle? Do you know how to poIka? I'II teach you. Stand on my feet. Here you go! -Good morning.|-Morning. What's the Iatest? He's not up yet. Good morning. But I have some good news. I saw him yesterday.|He's hiding a parachutist from London. A parachutist? Now they have parachutists. How do I beat that? Flying tanks? They need news,|but I have no new ideas. What can I invent now, Hannah?|Submarines? The Iatest.|Ask anybody eIse! I'm the onIy one in this whoIe ghetto|who's got no news, Hannah. Are you gonna work today,|or is this a one-man strike? -Come on! What are you doing?|-I have to go! Dysentery. Are you out of your mind? You're gonna commit suicide.|That's a German toiIet! Can't wait. You're gonna get shot,|you crazy bastard. " Massive traffic in Munich." " MiracIe cure for haemorrhoids."|Shit! "Sunny with occasionaI showers|in BerIin." " Heidi, I miss you. Franz." " In memoriam. In memoriam." " In memoriam. In memoriam." " LoyaI son of the FatherIand."|" Dear Nazis." News! "The Luftwaffe Reserves|beat the Kriegsmarine... ...3-2 in a hard-fought|but fair game." Thank you.|The Jews wiII rejoice at this news. God, a miracIe, pIease. AII right. Your fa ther cleans up after horses Listen to me closely|I'll explain Your mama sleeps nights in the park You fa ther's doing time in prison Your sister sleeps with a chazzer Your sister sleeps with a chazzer No, get off, pIease! KowaIsky, are you out of your mind? Are you aII right? What does it matter, now that you... ...the iIIustrious pancake vendor,|get to crap Iike a king? So now that you've shared|a toiIet seat with the master race... ...maybe you'II feeI good enough|to teII us the news. Yesterday, ChurchiII|addressed the PoIish peopIe. In PoIish? You want the Iatest news|or don't you? Our apoIogies. The main item... ...was that|the Luftwaffe soccer team... ...beat the Kriegsmarine|by 3 goaIs to 2. That's it? Want the Iatest news?|That's it. ChurchiII is on the BBC giving out|German army sports resuIts? Nothing about a front Iine? If ChurchiII has nothing|more important to announce... ...it means to me|the war is pretty much over. That's right. What if 3 to 2 is a code? CouId mean the Russians outnumber|the Germans 3 to 2. Or maybe they are 32 kiIometres away. I don't think so. I think it means that maybe|they are, I think, 32 hours away. If we Iisten hard enough,|maybe we can hear their artiIIery. Yes, that's what the noise|was Iast night. My wife thought it was|the heating pipes... ...but there hasn't been|any steam for years. -I heard it too.|-You heard it too? Yes, I heard it too. "Et tu, Brute?" I think it's time to organize. Professor, did you hear this Avron?|He pIans to organize. WeII, maybe he's right. Maybe we can save a few Iives if|we have an organization and a Ieader. For God's sake! The Russians may be pushed|aII the way back to Siberia by now. HardtIoff is here.|We know what that means. What? You're going to fight|the Germans barehanded? And what do you suggest we do? Just sit down and wait? Hope is aII very weII, but sometimes|it takes a IittIe action too. You wiII understand this. It'II be a massacre. AII because these Jews beIieve|the dreck I feed them. But you started this. And now you have to go on. Let's onIy|hope that your Iies were true. Let's hope that. What is it? You know what it is. Forgive me, but Jakob,|he's right. And I am wrong? And you are wrong. You smeIIed the cooking,|Mr. Frankfurter. Come in. -Mr. Frankfurter!|-Papa! I'm happy you stiII remember. How's Mama? You know how mothers are.|She hasn't seen you in a few days. So I said to myseIf: "Today is Sunday. I'II see our|daughter and bring her her things. And that way,|if they come to take us away... ...she'II stiII have her trousseau." It's beautifuI. But is it what we need right now? I know what you need right now. I pIayed SherIock HoImes|in The Hound of the Baskervilles. I aIways insisted on authentic props. Young man, I reaIized I care... ...about more peopIe|than my immediate famiIy. Perhaps I'm wrong and|your friend Jakob is right. WhiIe I'm baring my souI... ...I must teII you that I did not pIay|King Lear three times. I pIayed it once,|and I forgot haIf my Iines. Try not to get kiIIed|before you marry my daughter. And remember, untiI|the Iast Iine has been spoken-- The curtain cannot come down. WeII, gentIemen,|I think the person we need... ...has to have physicaI|as weII as moraI courage. He has to be a man who's proved|that he is wiIIing to take risks. And I think|he shouId aIso be a man... ...who's brought hope... ...hope and dignity to the ghetto. Thank you, Esther. Sounds Iike the professor to me. We wiII see. "Jakob Heym." You see? "Jakob Heym." " BIumenthaI!" Thanks. "Jakob Heym." -" Professor Kirschbaum."|-You see? "Jakob Heym." CongratuIations! A IittIe apricot Iiqueur. I was saving it|for a speciaI occasion. GentIemen! Jakob Heym. -To victory.|-To victory. I get the door. Gestapo! Open the door! Why are you running?|It's Mischa. Good joke. Very good joke. I know, I know. I'm not invited. But I have something... ...I think you wiII find interesting. My God.|Where did you get that? You have a radio, I have a gun. German steeI. We can count on them for something. Now that you're the Ieader,|what's our next move? We have to wait for the signaI. The signaI? And then we start the insurrection. The BBC said so. What's the signaI? Something very speciaI, Iike: "The chicken is in the pot"|or "The baby is singing." But our signaI is top secret. I'm not at Iiberty to teII you|at this time. Further evidence that you are in|the best position to Iead us, Jakob. But if I'm your Ieader,|I wiII onIy do it on one condition: You must be discipIined. AII of you. Now we onIy have a IittIe time Ieft.|Right, professor? And in that time, if anybody,|anybody does anything stupid... ...you have to answer to me. Open up! Gestapo! That's not Mischa. Open the door! Open the door! Does the Jew Kirschbaum Iive here? Professor Kirschbaum Iives here. Do you have an appointment? -We don't need one.|-TeII the professor this is urgent. Wait here. I shaII teII him you are here. Come in. Take a seat, pIease. We have some visitors. Andre, dear. Some gentIemen to see you. Best Iuck, Jakob. Shalom. There's onIy two. -That's two too many.|-Give me the gun. It's my gun. I am the Ieader. GentIemen... ...what can I do for you? PIease get your bag.|GeneraI HardtIoff has had a seizure. That's the first good news|I ever got from a German. HardtIoff? He's not my patient.|I presume he has his own doctor. Are you refusing? I'II get your bag. Thank you, Esther. I put in the other piIIs,|the ones for your heartburn. With a IittIe Iuck... ...you wiII not need them. UnfortunateIy, I think I wiII. Thank you... ...Esther. He'II be back. Thank you, sir. Thank you. It's a nice pIace.|It's a very nice pIace. Come. Come on! Go! -Sorry.|-Idiot! It's a great honour to meet you.|I attended aII your BerIin Iectures. BerIin?|The good oId days, yes. PIease sit. Over here. It seems that this IittIe town... ...is home to one of the greatest|cardioIogists in the worId. I had the honour|of teaching in BerIin. And now I'm a professor... ...of Iatrine cIeaning|in the freight yard here. I see. WeII... ...the ghetto is|going to be emptied tomorrow. I can see to it... ...you are not on the transport. Why so generous? I am surrounded by incompetents. These doctors are|unabIe to do anything for me... ...and the pain is unbearabIe. Open the jacket, pIease. Let me see. I know this sound, sir. I have a simiIar condition.|It's pretty painfuI, isn't it? But onIy here,|I have a IittIe probIem. On the one hand, as a physician,|I'm obIiged to heIp you. On the other hand,|if I save your Iife... ...you'II Iiquidate the ghetto. And if you do not... ...my men wiII Iiquidate you. This is the radio of the German|Armed Forces Network. HeiI, HitIer! We will now broadcast|a special bulletin. Our troops are engaged|in the Battle of Normandy. News.... Sorry. Perhaps you wouId Iike to hear|how the war is going. But, of course, you have|your own sources of information. Your own radio. -In the ghetto?|-You think we are stupid? We have informers. I know you Iisten to the BBC,|that you're dreaming about resistance. Why don't you give me the name|of the criminaI who owns the radio? I'II save you. What do you say? It's a hard decision to make, yes.|It's a hard decision. May I have a gIass of water? If it heIps you|to make up your mind, why not? Water. Thank you. Excuse me. Excuse me, sir,|but I.... Poison! It was poison! You bastard yid!|I forbid you to die! You reaIIy shouIdn't get excited. Take my advice. You know, I am|a worId-famous cardioIogist. WorId-famous cardioIogist.... I'm a famous... ...cardioIogist. Esther. Professor! Professor! Stop. He's dead. Rise. You Iet this dirty yid defy me! But, Herr GeneraI-- I want to see this radio here|tomorrow morning! Go! Heil, Hitler. HaIt! A criminal terrorist|is hiding a radio... ... in the ghetto,|in defiance of regulations. Unless the man responsible|brings himself and the accomplices... ... to the Kommandantur by midnight... ... 10 hostages|will be shot in reprisal. A criminal terrorist... ... is hiding a radio|in the ghetto... ... in defiance of regulations. Unless the man responsible|brings himself. .. ...and his accomplices... ... to the Kommandantur|by midnight... ... 10 hostages|will be shot in reprisal. Are you there? What do you want? Is that a way to greet a visitor? Sorry. ShouId I go to the basement,|fetch a bottIe of champagne? No wonder you never had any customers. So I wanted to teII you|about that green stuff. Never worked for Stamtisch... ...didn't work for me|and it won't work for you. The Iast cigarette before you teII me|to turn myseIf in. No, that's between|you and Him up there... ...if He is up there. No, actuaIIy... ...I wanted to ask you|about the signaI. I was wondering if that signaI|must have come by now. At Ieast any minute now.|What do you think? What? For what I'm about to say,|I'd rather be in the dark. I don't have a radio. I've never had one. And if I did, I wouIdn't have had|the guts to Iisten to it. So how did you know|where the Russians were? -I made it up. Most of it.|-I don't think so. I don't think you can make that up. The battIe for Rudna, and for|the tanks, the Luftwaffe, ChurchiII-- The jazz band. AII of that. ActuaIIy, the soccer score|was genuine... ...thanks to your dancing that day. And Bezanika, I reaIIy did hear|that in the Kommandantur. But as for the rest of it... ...it's Iies... ...aII Iies. Sometimes I amazed myseIf. But it's Iies... ...and wishfuI thinking. You're teIIing the truth. FinaIIy. Go ahead. TeII me how much you hate me. That was our dear friends,|the Germans... ...and haIf the German army... ...they were tearing|the ghetto apart... ...for a radio|that doesn't even exist? Don't teII Mischa.|It'II kiII him. You're not sIeeping. You shouIdn't|ruin your eyes Iike that. I'm not going to see|my parents again, am I? The Russians aren't coming, are they? Yes, they are. A whoIe battaIion of them. Straight from Moscow,|with tanks and a big band. Is that another Iie? Why shouId I beIieve you? WouId I Iie to you|about something Iike that? I heard you taIking|to your friend. But I understand why you did it. You wanted to be... ...to be good. That's from Hannah. She toId me she wishes|we had a IittIe girI Iike you. Where are you going? I have something I have to do,|and you shouId sIeep. Why? Questions, aIways questions. I have to give the Germans my radio. But you don't have a radio. That's a probIem, isn't it? You know, maybe I'II go|and expIain it... ...aII to my good friend|in the Gestapo... ...and he'II see|the funny side of it... ...and we'II have|a good Iaugh about it. That one's from me, maidelah. Be carefuI. Mischa, open the door.|It's me, Jakob. Has the signaI come? Not yet, but I need your services. -Are we rescuing the hostages?|-That's being taken care of. But your mission|is to go to my attic. I'II get my cIothes. Not now. Tomorrow, if I don't show up|at work... ...you must go to my pIace|under the cover of darkness... ...and transfer here something speciaI|I Ieft for you to take care of. The radio? Something speciaI. -I understand.|-Good. Where's my gun? This mission does not require a gun. It requires a good brain|and a strong heart. So I chose you, our best man. Mazel tov. Goodbye, my friend. Dear Jakob: You'll probably hold yourself|responsible for my death... ...and if you look at it one way... ...you'd be right. But when you look at it|a different way... ...your imaginary radio|gave me a reason... ... to keep going|for a few more days, anyway. Much as I'd like to,|I don't hold anything against you. With a bit of luck,|you'll find some other schmuck... ... to shave you for free. Until I see you again,|I remain your best customer... ...Kowalsky. Shalom, chazzer! Remember me? The smart Jew? Why are you out after curfew? It's about my radio. I must see the officer on duty.|I wish to give myseIf up. Maybe you're not such a smart Jew. Keep going. I know the way. It's in here. So... ...here we have the famous Jakob. Did you bring your radio? Yes and no. Let's go! PIease! PIease! PIease! Come on! Come on! You're crazy.|You're going to get us kiIIed. I have to go to Jakob's. Rosa, go! HaIt! HaIt! The radio? The hostages. Nothing yet? Another few more minutes,|Herr GeneraI. AII right. Continue. TeII us about the radio. I wiII see|what I can do for the hostages. -Look by the window.|-There's nothing here. It has to be here somewhere. I hear something. Sorry if I frightened you. Who are you?|What are you doing here? I'm Lina Kronstein. I Iive here.|But it's a secret. You're Mischa, yes? Jakob said you'd take care of me. Take care of you? Of course, we'II be happy to.|Won't we? Listen to me very carefuIIy.|This is very important. Do you know where Jakob|hid the radio? -Of course I do.|-You do? I've heard it. "This is the BBC from London." You actuaIIy heard this radio? I'm not supposed to teII anyone. Where is it? Where is your damn radio? Lina, where the radio is matters|a great deaI to a Iot of peopIe. WouId Jakob trust us to Iisten to it? Stop. I'II show you. I'II show you my radio. Go, Lina. Go, go! Forget about the radio, Mischa! That... ...is my radio. You've just toId your Iast joke, yid! Stop. Go! Run there! Run. Trust me, run! Don't shoot. PIease don't shoot.|Don't shoot! It was you. The Jew who was out after curfew. And it was your radio I heard. Excuse me, sir,|is that a probIem for you? You're the one with the probIem,|my friend! That's true. That's certainIy the case.|I can't argue with that. But to Iet a Jew hear a radio... ...that's a serious offense, isn't it? You can shoot me,|but you stiII don't have my radio. So... ...we both have a probIem, don't we? May I? You will stand up|in front of the Jews... ...and tell them there was no radio. You made it all up. Everything. There is no radio, no resistance. In return for your confession,|I won't shoot you. But you wiII put me|on a transport to the camps. It's the same thing, isn't it? That's not much of a deaI for me. You may be a good soIdier... ...but you're not|much of a businessman. Excuse me for saying so. Who knows? You might survive a week|in the camps. Two weeks. Six months. UntiI the Russians or the Americans|or the British arrive. You know how cIose they are,|don't you? There's aIways hope. Isn't there? What man doesn't want to see|the next day... ...and the one after that? You aII know this man. He toId you he had a radio. He toId you|that you shouId resist... ...the German authorities. He wiII now teII you... ...that this was aII a Iie. He wiII teII you that|there never was such a radio. And that resistance... ...is pointIess. TeII them. TeII them. Hey, you. TeII them. So that's how it ended. I never got a chance to be|the big hero and make my big speech. I swear, I had a speech|all prepared... ...about freedom|and never giving in. But somehow.... Yes, that's how it ended. They all went off to the camps... ...and were never seen again. But maybe it wasn't|like that at all. Because, you know,|as Frankfurter says: "Until the last line|has been spoken... ... the curtain cannot come down. " About 50 kilometres out of town... ... the train was stopped|by Russian troops... ... who hadjust|taken Bezanika and Pry. Roll it out, roll it out|Roll out the barrel Sing a song of good cheer 'Cause the whole gang is here Roll it out, roll it out Let's do the Beer Barrel Polka!
