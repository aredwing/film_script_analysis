That place does look evil as hell. Look, man, both y'all need to shut the fuck up, all right? We're doin' this shit 'cause this here's business, man. Besides, dead people ain't who y'all need to be worried about anyway. Little Moe the fuck y'all need to be worried about. Now, the sooner we get the shit... the sooner we raise up outta this motherfucker, man. Pass the buds, you little bitch. Let's roll, brother. Hey, man, maybe I need to stay out here... and watch y'all's back and shit in case something funny go down. Wait a minute. You got your gat, man? Yeah, I got my shit. Well, if a dead motherfucker come fuckin' with you, you kill his ass. Do you understand me? Hold on, Bulldog. How am I supposed to kill something that's already dead? What? How am I supposed to kill somethin' that's already dead? That's like killing some shit twice, man. Yeah, like some refried beans and some shit. I never understood that, man. Why the fuck you gonna refry some beans? Why not just fry that shit right the first time and get up? Both y'all just shut the fuck up, all right? Let's just take care of this business and move on, man. Shit. Fuck this dead people shit! Now, shut up. Ain't nothin' to be scared of. Understand me? - Damn! - What the fuck? I've been waiting for you boys. - I have some iodine in the lab. - Hey, man. I don't need nothin' from your house of dead folks, okay? - Besides, I ain't no baby. - Of course you're not. - Looked like one when that door opened. - Nigger, what's up? Come on, partner. Got no time for this. Let's just take care of this business and move on, man. Now, where's the shit? The shit? The shit that you found. Oh. The drugs. I found a whole stock of them in the alley. So where they at? You got the money? Yeah, we got the money, old man. You'll get it when we get the shit. The shit? The shit. Drugs. You get the drugs, then I get the money. Okay. Now, this is all new to me. I'm not a drug dealer. I'm a mortician. The only drugs I know about... are those that have to do with the deceased. Yo, man, what kind of drugs do dead people be needin'? All kinds. We shoot them real good with embalming fluid, mainly. You know, it keeps them from smelling... and decomposing before the service. Cool. So what happened here? Oh, they say he went crazy. Death. It comes in many strange packages. I don't need to be hearin' this, man. Kill that noise, man. Let's just get the shit. Don't worry. You'll get the shit. You'll be knee-deep in the shit. I've got it hid. There's so much... I couldn't even lift it all myself. I'll tell you about old Clarence here along the way. Unless, of course, you're scared. They say he was hearing voices... voices calling his name... voices from the dead... calling... "Clarence!" Clarence, now this here is a real quiet neighborhood... but that doesn't mean that you can take a break. 'Cause the second you slack off, boom... that's just when the shit hits the fan. - Got it. Stay alert at all times. - That's right. Now let's go up and check out this out-of-place. Gonna lose your badges over this. You had no reason to pull me over. You got a fuckin' taillight out. Shut up and spread those goddamn legs. You're not taking any more cops' badges. They keep selling drugs in my community, you can bet I'll keep taking 'em down. Yeah? Well, we'll see about that. - Hey, what do we got, fellas? - No, rookie. He'll get it. Just back off. Go on away. Go run a check on his license plate. See if the car is stolen. - It's okay. Go on. - We got it. Spread 'em. Now let me ask you something, huh? Are you getting off... on destroying good cops' lives? You big-mouthed goddamn son of a bitch! - I've got nothing against good cops. - You what? I said I've got nothing against good cops... but I will see lowlife scum like you run out of the department. You shut the fuck up, cocksucker! Shit! You're fuckin' dead, bro. You fucked up big time. Let me have some of this. Look at me! - You want him? - Yeah. Let me teach him a thing or two. You there, huh? You inside? And I promise you... we won't stop until we get every single crooked cop in this city. Neither drugs nor pretenders of the law... will be allowed to drain the life of this community. Son of a bitch. - Hey, what are you guys doing? - Strom! - Stop him! - That's enough, Strom. - Stop it! - Not in front of the rookie. This man is Martin Moorehouse. I can't believe I didn't recognize him. - What the hell is wrong with you? - Hey, back off! Fuck off! This is no time to be fighting. We gotta get this guy to a hospital. That's right. Let's get him to a hospital. What? You want some of me? You're out of line! You get your ass out of here. We'll take care of it. Get outta here! You get back there in the unit. This is our damn patrol. Sorry. Strom, you know what we have to do. Damn it! We need to report those assholes, Newton. You listen to me! And you listen good. Those assholes are cops. Who the fuck are you to judge 'em? Shit, man, you got a green dick. Those two guys have been risking their asses on the street for years. The fucker went for Strom's gun. Bullshit. Now, maybe those two guys went too far tonight. Maybe it was all a mistake. But next time it could be you. So, you know, you don't ever roll over... and you never rat out a fellow officer. And you never... never break the code. Knock, knock. We're here. - Hospital? - Yeah. Come on, boy. We'll get you all fixed up. Wanna have a little party? Hmm? You see, you were right about one thing. The cops are dealing drugs in the sixth precinct. But you're never gonna tell about it, are ya? - Think that's enough? - Just put 'em in the trunk. Clarence! Bring them to me. Bring them to me! Clarence, bring them to me. I will. Welcome, officers. For a minute, I thought you weren't gonna show. Man, he looks like fly-covered shit. You look like fly-covered shit. Haven't seen you in a long time. I've missed ya, pal. You had the number. You should've reached out and touched a brother. You could've told him how to reach out and touch a brother, Strom. Now, Clarence... Clarence Smith... come on. Come on down from the grave. Now, let me ask you this, son. What the fuck did you call us out here for, huh? - A celebration. - No, answer me, boy! What'd you call us out here for? - To celebrate. - What are we celebrating tonight? Our anniversary. Our anniversary. You remember, don't you? One year ago today. I fell for your bullshit. I actually believed... that Strom and Billy were gonna take Moorehouse to the hospital. Shut the fuck up! You don't get it, do you? We tried to take him, and he didn't wanna go. - You understand? - Let's cut the shit, Strom! - Shut the fuck up, boy! - Cut the shit! That story never did make any sense. - Just save it. - Save it for who? Hey, Clarence, if we go down, you go down. That's right, Clarence. You go down. You guys killed a good man, and you ruined his name! I should've turned you in instead of just quittin' the force. - You quit because you're a pussy. - You're a goddamn pussy. So I thought the least we could do is pay our respects. What do you mean "pay respects"? Pay Martin Moorehouse a little visit. Or are you too much of a pussy to visit him? A fuckin' fruitcake. How are we supposed to visit a dead guy? Are you saying you want us to go out to Moorehouse's grave with you? - That's exactly what I'm saying. - Excuse me. Fuck you. If we go, will that be the end of it? You'll be satisfied? I'll be totally satisfied. Well, in that case, I don't think there's a problem. - I got no problem. - You guys agree? Follow me, fellas. - Lead the way. - Let's go. - Hey, what the fuck are we doing? - Clarence won't be making it back. How much further? Martin's right here. This grave. I brought them. Are you happy? Shit. You expect us to believe you're talkin' to this dead fucker? Quite frankly, I don't know what to expect. My orders were to get you out here. I'm good at that, you know. Following orders. It's just an electrical storm. What, are we supposed to be scared to death? Is that it? Don't know, Strom. Should you be? You know, you piss me off. You know that? - I'll be the first to volunteer. - You're not gonna. You know what I'm gonna do? You know what I'm gonna do, boy? Get out of my way. I'm gonna piss on... I'm gonna piss on his grave. Way to go, Strom. That's pretty cool. You know what? Kind of dry here. Billy, why don't you come on over here and piss with me? I don't need to go, man. I took a piss right before we came out here. - Did you hear what I said? - I don't need to. - I said go piss on it. Do it! - For Christ's sakes, leave him alone. It's okay, man. Piss. This'll be as good a place as any to bleed the old lizard, I guess. - Come on. - Say good night. Come on now. Shouldn't have done that. What in the hell have you done? Holy shit! - Where did he go? - Oh, God! Where the fuck did he go? Get outta the way! Stop shooting, goddamn it! There's nothing there! He's gone! This is no time to panic! Well, when the fuck do we start to panic? - Holy shit! - Jesus! What? Oh, no! Billy. The fucker. Now's a good time to panic! Get the hell outta here! Come on! To the car! - Punch it! - Fuck! - I'm trying to, damn it! - Oh, for God's sake! Get out! - He's still there! - How far back? Jesus Christ! He's right behind us. How far back? Get him off the car! Get him off! What are you doing? And what are you gonna tell 'em? That the body of a citizen we murdered has come back to kill us? Use your fuckin' head for once! Besides, he's gone, man! Bullshit! What's happening? - Jesus! Where the hell is he? - I don't fuckin' know, man. Now you! No, you're dead! Do you see him? I killed him! He's dead! Welcome to my world. Are you satisfied now, brother? Where were you... when I needed you, brother? - What's the story with this guy? - Homicidal maniac. Cop killer. Three in one night. And trip this. He used to be a cop. Wow! Man, you just never know, do you? Yes. Crazy as a loon. Talk about some insane in the membrane type of shit. Shut up, man. The pigs got what they deserved, homeboy. No, man. What are you talking about? Can't be for real. Sometimes reality is just a matter of perception. What the fuck that? Reality. Perception. A cornucopia of clashing. Divergent ideas. - Crazy, man. - Come on, man. Man, what type of shit? What the fuck happened to him? Hey, can we just get our shit and go? Oh, no. You'd want to hear about this one. It's a classic case... of what is and isn't real... in the mind... of a boy named Walter. Perception. Reality. Walter. All right, everybody, take your seats. Okay, we have a new student joining us today. I want you all to say hello to Walter. Hello, Walter. - Do something, punk. - Yeah, we don't like punks. I'm not a punk. Who you shovin'? Fight! Hey, whoa! Everybody go back to their class. Oh, man! What's your problem? You must really like detention. Come on. Here, honey. Hold this up to your head. - So, how's the little warrior doing? - He's got a thick head. I am worried about that, though. - Did Tyrone get you in the eye? - That didn't just happen. It's a couple of days old. Look at the coloring. Tyrone didn't hit you? Well, who did? Was it one of the other boys? Was it someone at home? Maybe your mother? Your father? Did he do this? - Uh-uh. He's dead. - I'm sorry. Walter, if you tell me and Nurse Parchman... it'll just be our little secret, okay? The monster. The monster? He came after my dad died. I see. If you decide you want to tell me what really happened... I'm gonna be here to listen, okay? He said no one would believe me. He's back. Now, Walter, you be sure and put this back just like this. Stop! You didn't want to go outside? - What's that? - Him. - Him? - The monster. Laurie told me to draw it, and it would destroy it... and the monster's gonna go away. - Laurie that sits behind you? - I'm gonna burn him up. Laurie said that her mom said to draw the things that scared her... then tear it up or burn it... and then it'll go away. That's Tyrone. Do you think I could talk to your mother sometime? What for? About the monster. You've told her, haven't you? She doesn't want to hear it. She says we already moved once. You know, I don't think... that drawing these pictures is really the answer to your problem. But I think we can work something out together, okay? I guess so. Good. I will see you after recess. Excuse me, guys. What happened to him? He was running in the building after recess and fell down the stairs. - Did somebody shove him? - No, he just fell. Sort of collapsed. But, you know, it makes no sense. How do you break both arms and legs falling down? Boy must've had weak bones. - Who is it? - I'm Mr. Garvey. I'm one of Walter's teachers from school. This fell. Thank you. Is there a problem? - No, Mrs.... - Miss. Miss Johnson, can I come in and talk to you for a minute? Yes. I'm sorry. I'm gonna go throw something on. Damn. Miss Johnson, I came to talk to you about your boy Walter. He seems to be having some problems. Problems? Yeah. Perhaps because he just recently changed schools. What kind of problems? I mean, all kids have problems, don't they? That's what life is... problems. He got you good. Here, step into the light for me. Well, he seems to come to school with bruises, you know? Kind of banged up. The boy is clumsy. He's always falling over something. I don't know where he gets it. Not me. Certainly not me. Certainly not. But he does seem to have a strange preoccupation with monsters. I mean, a monster in particular... that he says lives here in the house. It sounds silly, but... Listen, there's no need to bring Walter into this. I've told that boy about going on with these stories. I can't have it. I said get your narrow behind in this kitchen now! Miss Johnson, I just came to talk to you. Get over here. What is your problem? Now, why the hell are you going on telling this man these crazy stories? Didn't I tell you to stop with all this monster foolishness? Go to your room. Baby, go to your room now. - I'm gonna have to... - Will you give me a second to talk? Please, just keep quiet. Don't say nothing. Why are you just standing there? Why the hell didn't you get the door? Who's that? That's just one of Walter's teachers. He was just leaving. Is there a problem? Actually, he just came over to drop off some homework. Actually, sir, now that you mention it... Walter does seem to be having a few small problems... that might deserve some looking into. Well, Walter's only been at this school for a couple of weeks... and he does have trouble making friends. So what kind of problem are we talking about? Well, aside from the bruises... aside from that... there's a monster that he says is in the house. He seems very disturbed by it. In fact, he's even drawn a picture... of the monster. He thinks he needs to kill the monster. I mean, he really believes it. I'll talk to him. That's it? You'll just talk to him? I will talk to him. Sissy, would you show him to the door, please? Thanks for the tea. Go to your room. - Miss Johnson... - Go! You little motherfucker. You like to draw fucked-up pictures of people, huh? Carl, no! I'm gonna teach you and that boy some respect. Help me! Stop! You gonna make a picture to kill me? Motherfucker, come here! Carl, please! Open up! Your little ass is mine! Oh, you gonna draw a picture of somebody and make them look like a monster? You think that shit is funny? Huh? - Get up! - Miss Johnson! - You okay? - He's gonna kill him. Wait here. Stop it! Just take it easy! This ain't your motherfuckin' house! - Take it easy. - Motherfucker! Get up! I'm not through with this yet! Come here! - What's it gonna be? - Let me go! Motherfucker! Have you lost your mind? I guess you need an ass-whoopin' too! Bitch! This shit ain't over yet, bitch. But I think it is. What are we gonna do? If they find him here like this, no one's gonna believe us. Don't worry. Nobody's gonna find out anything. Walter, you know what to do. Yes, sir... Walter killed the monster. - Is that really how he got dropped? - Man, close this thing! What the fuck? So dead motherfuckers be playin' with dolls now, right? Yes. But this doll... it's a way station for lost souls. - What? - Sometimes... when a person's body has been through a lot... the soul is displaced. This doll is a place for the soul to survive... until it can move on. Man, you for real? Yes! I found this doll... in a house in the South. It is an amazing thing. You can give it any name you want. The fact is, affirmative action, quotas, reparations... all mean one thing... another qualified individual won't get a job... or an education... simply because he's not the right color. I thought that's what we were trying to get away from. Duke Metger for governor. An original American. Isn't it about time? That's great. I'd even vote for me. Listen, by the time I finish with you... you might even get a few black votes in the till. Well, a start would be just getting the bastards off my front lawn. It's startin' to look like a damned minstrel show out there. If they were as relentless about findin' a job... as they are houndin' me... we might put an end to welfare. Duke must go! Beyond the obvious concern that the black and Jewish community share... over the candidacy of one-time Klan member Duke Metger... there seems to be an additional issue that has sparked anger among blacks. Councilman Rogers, can you explain? Lani, it's disturbing enough that Duke Metger... would claim residency here just for the sake of gaining votes. But the real slap in the face to the black community... is that he chose this house... this former plantation... with its history of racism towards black people... to set up camp. - Can anything be done? - There are things that we plan to do. Ain't nothin' we need to do! They gonna make him pay for bein' here! - Who will make him pay, sir? - The souls gonna make him pay! They gonna make him pay for Miss Cobbs, the keeper of the souls. There was peace, but there's no peace in the dollhouse now. - The dollhouse? - The dollhouse! - They gonna make him pay! - Just an old myth. Ain't no myth! Go away, old man. What is it about this house that has them so worked up? After the Civil War, the man who owned this plantation, Nathan Wilkes... he was upset that his slaves were gonna walk away free. When they tried to leave, the old man snapped. Went into a massacre. Hundreds of slaves. Lynchings, burnings. Twelve bodies hangin' from that tree alone. Yeah, they buried 'em in a common grave up on the hill. Now, fools believe that their souls never rested... till Miss Cobbs, an old voodoo woman, bought the place. That's here there in the mural. - And what are those? - Dolls. Legend is she transferred the souls of the slaves into little dolls. Negro dolls. Word is, they remain in the house right to this day. You ever seen any of 'em? I searched every inch of this house when I first bought the place... I figured the little black bastards might be worth something... But no, I never found any. Now they feel that the place should remain empty... as a remembrance to the atrocity... to let the souls rest, like an old Nazi camp. Personally, I think the whole thing adds to a certain Southern charm. You're a sick fuck, Duke. Perhaps. But it's your job, Mr. $10,000-a-week image maker... to change all that, to soften the hard edges. Mold me into a respected man of the people. Well, I've got my work cut out for me, don't I? The first thing we're gonna work on is your defensive media skills. When you get out here in front of these cameras... these reporters, making these public appearances... you've always got to expect the unex... This thing's kind of creepy, don't you think? I'm gonna paint the whole place over after the election. - Let's get you elected first, Duke. - We'll get it. I feel I have a lot to offer all the constituents in this community... not just the white constituency. So are you telling us, Duke, that your former affiliation with the KKK... is not something that the voters should concern themselves with? We all have a past now, don't we? You're much too defensive. Looks like you have something to hide. Look, I want you to watch me. Take the camera. - I want you to film me. - Hold on. Good. We all have a past. It's the better man who can learn from his failures. I know that I've learned from mine, and I'm better for it. Uh-huh. Well, what about the house? Well, I think that it's quite unfair to judge me or anyone else... by the misdeeds of his ancestors. After all, I have quite a few of my own to account for. Aren't you afraid of the dolls? What about the ghosts? Well, the only spooks that I'm afraid of... are the ones with guns. That's a good one, Rhodie. I believe I'm gonna use it. Oh, no. Not if you want to get elected, you won't. Okay? Jesus, I've been around you too long. Look, Duke, this is the real response to that one, okay? I'm not concerned with ghost stories. I'm concerned with traditional American values. Original... Let us bow our heads in prayer. Unto the mercy of Almighty God... we commend the soul of our brother departed. We commit his body to the ground... earth to earth... ashes to ashes... dust to dust... in the sure and certain hope... of the resurrection to eternal life. Is there any truth to the rumor that Mr. Willis' death was the result... of some mysterious circumstances? No, it was simply an unfortunate accident. Don't you think it would help your position with the black community... if you simply left Wilkes Manor and found another residence? I think it's unfair to judge me or any other person... by the misdeeds of their ancestors. Besides, I have many misdeeds of my own to account for. So, you're not afraid of the ghosts? The only spooks I'm afraid of... are you spooky reporters. - What is your real goal? - That's about it, folks. Thank you. You need to be scared, Mr. Metger. Them souls don't want you there. They didn't want him there. Now you best to leave... or you'll end up just like him, or worse. Well, sir, I have no intention of leaving... so let's just hope that the house and I can get along. Can't we all just get along? Heed my warning, Metger. They don't want you there. - The dolls don't want you there! - That's about it. Go away, old fool. Do you hear me? They want reparation! They want reparation, Mr. Metger! Driver, who'd you let in this vehicle? Stop the car. Stop the damn car! Goddamn it! I let no one in the car, sir. This is the real response to that one. Go. I'm not concerned with ghost stories. I'm concerned with traditional American values, original American... What the fuck? Bruce, I need you or Janet to give me a call. There's somethin' wrong here. Bruce! Janet! You back? Thank goodness. You! Where the fuck did your little black ass come from? You think you and some old voodoo bitch can scare me out of my house? I don't care how many slaves died here. I didn't kill 'em. You'll get no reparations. You hear me? No reparations! You goddamn voodoo bitch. I'll put an end to your nigger ass. Now I'm gonna blow off your little nigger balls! Not even some voodoo bitch Negress spell... can overcome the power of a double-barreled shotgun! Goddamn. I'm not afraid of you! I killed one of you! I'll kill you all, you... You little nigglin's! Come on out, you little nappy-headed sons of bitches! Come on. Come on out. Say good night, you little piece of black shit. Goddamn! Jesus! Open! You. It gives you new reverence for dolls, now don't it? I mean, fuck it. This is bullshit, Bulldog. You gonna show us what we came here to get, or what? Really, though. See, I ain't got all night to be listenin' to no goddamn ghost stories. These ain't ghost stories. Everything I say is real. Let's get this shit over with. Let's see how real this shit is you got. Ah, the shit. You ain't gonna believe this, man. This shit is a trip, homey. Yes. You knew him? - Sure did. - Hell, no. We didn't know him. He was just a nigger we seen around. He got himself involved... in that crazy gang madness. Yeah. Shit. He got himself involved... in the shit. There's that punk motherfucker Deke right there! Catch you now, you motherfuckin' bitch. Here, motherfucker. Come on, nigger. Smoke this, nigger. Where the fuck you think you're goin', bitch? Goddamn, nigger. You tryin' to blind me? What's up? What's up with that shit you been talkin'? Bitch-ass nigger. Son of a bitch! Motherfucker! Where you want me to shoot your ass, motherfucker? In the head or in the chest? Blast your little-ass dick off first. - Fuck this, man! - Hold on. Don't do this cat just yet. I wonder how many homies he done puked over the years. Too fuckin' many! What's up now, Crazy K? You crazy, huh? It's what you call "fucked up." Fuck! Shit! Saved by a motherfuckin' cop. Damn. Oh, fuck. Read me the summary on this one. "Jerome Johns, serving the fourth year... of a life sentence without a possibility of parole. Solitary confinement the last two years for assaults on other prisoners. Previous arrests and convictions included... aggravated assault, first degree battery... suspicion of murder three times, aggravated mayhem." Jerome! How would you like to be released from prison? Is you fuckin' with my mind, or what? How that shit gonna happen? Consent to behavioral modification... and you'll be out in no time. - Yo, let's do this. - Yo, let's. He'll do. Prepare him for transfer. Get the fuck off me, man! Shit! Well, look what we have here. The first soldier in my army, perhaps. So you're a real bad-ass spade, huh? What'd you say to me, motherfucker? You heard me. You gotta be really bad to be in a place like this. Otherwise you wouldn't be here. So what'd you do? What you in for? Murder, punk! And I wouldn't mind doin' the shit again. Me either. I killed a lot of people. You wanna know what kind? Come over here. I wanna show you somethin'. What's wrong? Are you afraid of me? The final fight between black and white has begun. I've led my troops on a wave of assaults... to wake up my white brother. All of the niggers of the Earth will be killed... except for the few that helped with the fight against... their mud-soul brethren. Those few will be spared... and live their lives as slaves. Do you wanna be spared? Come join my army. Hey, nigger, those guys you killed... What color were they? They were niggers. I know it. You're cool with me, nigger. I like you. I like you a lot. I didn't like bein' put in there with that crazy Klan motherfucker. I put you next to him because I thought he was someone you ought to meet. You are here to be rehabilitated... by a process that the government has paid me to develop. If you successfully complete this project... there's a very good chance you might be released. If you don't, you will rot in solitary confinement... for the rest of your wasted life. And it wouldn't bother me a bit... 'cause I think you're scum, Jerome. So don't test me. You understand? Our tests show you have a high IQ. Have you ever been interested in science? Yeah. I sold a few chemicals in my day. I know you don't think I'm gettin' on that thing. You have no other choice. Fuck! Come on, man! Shit! I'll break your fuckin' neck when I get out this motherfucker! I don't think so. Start the optical sequences. Jerome, I want you to take a little look at something. What's wrong, Jerome? You don't like seein' black people get killed? But isn't that what you've been doin' all your life, Jerome? You know, Jerome... Cain was the world's first murderer. He slayed his brother! And how many brothers have you slain? Sensory what? Sensory deprivation chamber. You will see nothing. You will hear nothing. Your mind will have nothing to feed upon but itself. It's a tiny meal, indeed. What's up, Crazy K? Remember me? Tracy? Yeah, man. What's up? How come we ain't talked in a long time? That's right. You killed my ass! Ain't that a bitch? I got one question for you, Crazy K. Why? Why? Y-You was comin' up short all the time, man. I-I couldn't just let you rip me off, nigger. And now us. That shit was wrong, man. Just drove by and started blastin'. That shit was wrong, man. We ain't even the ones that capped your homey. That shit was really wrong, G. Man, fuck you, niggers! It was your set that did Little Joe! You would've tried to kill me if you had the chance! Fuck you, niggers! Fuck you all! I didn't do anything. I was playing in my room, and the bullet from your gun came through the wall. A-A bullet ain't got no name on it. Y-You was just at the wrong place at the wrong time. Shut up! Shut the fuck up! Why should they? Are they saying something you don't want to hear? So you gonna blame all this shit on me? You tryin' to make me crazy or somethin', motherfucker? I don't owe no responsibilities for these motherfuckers. But you are responsible for the lives you've taken... for the dreams you've turned into nightmares. Nightmares? Motherfucker, what about my nightmares? What about the nightmare I lived in? What about the nightmare I lived in ever since I was born into this motherfucker? Who's responsible for that? I don't know, Jerome. You tell me. Who is responsible? Your mother? Your father? Your teachers? The world? Who? Yeah, that's right. All of those motherfuckers, 'cause they created me. So now I'm the motherfuckin' nightmare! The nightmare ends when you say it does, Jerome. You've got to take responsibility to wake up! You've got to take responsibility to break this chain! I got one motherfuckin' responsibility in this world, and that's me. And that's it, motherfucker! So anybody and everything that ain't me, ain't shit! Do you understand that? That's a question best posed to yourself. I'm givin' you a chance. I'm givin' you a shot at redemption! Do you understand that? I don't give a fuck about none of you stupid motherfuckers! So what you do is stop fuckin' with my mind, man... and let me out of this motherfucker! There's nothing to stop you, Jerome. Shut the fuck up! Shut up! Let me out of this motherfucker, or I'll snap this bitch's neck! It's not too late to be saved. You won't get another chance. I don't need another motherfuckin' chance. You know why? 'Cause I don't give a fuck. I said, I don't give a fuck. I don't give a fuck! - Jerome! - I don't give a fuck! I don't give a fuck! We don't give a fuck either, motherfucker! Oh, I must say. I don't think you can rehabilitate those types. No. You just kill them. Who do you think you're fuckin' with, old man? - What? - Yeah, cap this fool. What? What? You know what. I'm sick of playin' this ring-around-the-rosies. Now, that last little story? That shit wasn't funny. What you gonna do? Call the cops or some shit? Now, why... would I do that? 'Cause you know who it was that killed the nigger, and you ain't said shit. Motherfucker! One less nigger. - Punk motherfucker. - Fuck him. Just bust a cap in this old fool now. Don't be stupid, motherfucker. Let's just get the shit first. Now, where it's at? Shit. Follow me. Oh, yes. Now we gonna get the shit. Oh! We gonna get the shit now. - More ring-around-the-rosies, huh? - Yeah, the doodoo. - I'm sick of fuckin' with his ass. - We gonna get the shit. Man, with these spiders and shit. What the fuck is this? Ain't this some shit! You know what? Right about now, man... I'm losin' my patience! Now, where it's at? Handle your business! This old man crazy. What the fuck is wrong now? Shit. - Where it's at? - Where? Where is the shit, man? - I don't trust this. - Hold up! - This old man crazy. - I have it hid! It's in the coffins. Where else... would I hide it? Got the shit! Sick of playin' these crazy games with your ass. It better be in here. About fuckin' time! 'Cause you know, I don't wanna hear about another motherfucker. Holy shit! What the fuck is this, man? What's goin' on? What are we gonna do, Bulldog? I don't know. Blast him! What the... Oh! After you killed Crazy K... a few of his boys killed you. I guess... you didn't make it. No!
