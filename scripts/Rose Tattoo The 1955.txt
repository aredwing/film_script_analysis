Wait here. - Little girl. - Yes? - You're a twig off the old rosebush. - What? Is the lady that does the sewing in the house? Nobody's here but Daddy and me. And Daddy's asleep. Do you mind if I wait on the porch till she gets back? She won't be long. Where is your mama? Ideal Grocery Store. Look, she buys Grade A. I buy Grade B. - Now, which is which? - Oh, yeah. Don't mix up those eggs. What difference is it? Which is it? I'll tell you the difference. I got a Grade A husband, that's the difference. Oh, then I got a Grade B husband? I don't know which grade is your husband. I got a Grade A husband, and I know the difference. Yeah, I know the difference, and I don't give a Grade A husband a Grade B egg for his breakfast. - OK? - Package. Your package, lady. Where is somebody, please, to carry this package for me on the street? My husband don't allow me - to carry big packages... - Next. - Like a horse on the street. Please! - Next. Oh, my. OK. Thank you, huh? - Buon giorno, Serafina. - Buon giorno, Padre. You are dressed for a party? No, I am dressed for a big celebration. I got some wonderful news to give my husband. Oh? What news? I got to tell this news to my husband first. I'm sorry, Father. Goodbye. Goodbye. Oh, my. Mama. - Is Papa home, cara? - Yes, he's here. A lady's waiting for you on the porch, Mama. - Lady? - Yes. - Open the door for me. - All right. Ale! Oh, please. Let me see. Let me see! Let me see. Such a perfume. - My! Where is Papa? - In the bedroom, sleeping. - Sleeping? - Yes. Why don't you tell me he was sleeping before I slam the door? - Scimmia. - He has to make a night run, Mama. Don't make any noise. Amore. Come sai di buono. I like the smell of rose oil in your hair. Good. Good. Oh, love, tonight is a feast, you know. Because I have been to the doctor. I have a new life in my body. Yeah. I have a new life in my body. It's true. It's true. Oh, love, stay with me tonight. Don't go, please. I don't understand these strange night runs that you make. I don't understand. I don't like it. I don't like it. Stay with me, please. This... This night run is the last that you make. Is the last. You hear me? You hear me, darling? You... You promise me, darling. - Si, last run. Si. - OK. OK, thank you. OK. Mama? The lady says she can't wait. Yeah. Vengo. Rest, love. Rest. I come back right away. Right away. - Hello. - Hello. - Do you want something? - I heard you do sewing. Talk soft, please. My husband is sleeping in there. What do you want sewed? How fast can you make a shirt for me? Oh, that depends. I have some silk with me I want made into a shirt. - There. - Wonderful. Look at that colore. Rosa, huh? Wonderful stuff for a blouse, pajamas. Oh, I want a man's shirt made out of it. Silk this color for a...? For a shirt for a man? Well, this man's wild like a Gypsy. He likes to feel silk on his skin and wants everything rose-colored. A woman should not encourage a man to be wild. Never. If a man's wild, he's hard for a woman to hold. But if he's tame, would a woman want to hold him? I told you soft, please. My husband's sleeping. Oh, I'm sorry. I'm a married woman in business. I don't know nothing about wild men and wild women. I'm sorry. I'll give you twice what you ask me for it. Money isn't the object, but it has to be ready tomorrow. - Tomorrow? Oh, it's impossible. - Twenty dollars! - Impossible. - But it has to be ready tomorrow. Because tomorrow's the anniversary of the day we met, me and this man I love. I want him to wear this shirt in honor of the occasion. I have his measurements right here with me. Mama! The black goat is loose in the yard! - The black goat is loose in the yard! - Keep him out of the yard. Stop shouting. Let Papa sleep. Pin the measurements, your name on the silk, and the shirt will be ready tomorrow. I'm sorry. My name's Estelle Hohengarten. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Catch him! My tomat... Oh, my! - The goat is loose. - The goat's loose! The goat's loose! Hey! Come back here! - Mardi Gras Club. - Rosa! Rosa! You go in the house! Don't look at the strega. - Why do you call her a witch? - She has the evil eye. - Go in the house. - She has a cataract. On strillare. She shook hands with the devil. She did not shake hands with the devil. She has rheumatism. Malocchio. On strillare. Go in the house. And wash your face with saltwater, and throw the saltwater away. Go in the house! Go in, quick! She's coming. Malocchio. Rosario. Mama... ...why did Papa run away like that? I don't know, Rosa. Car 61 calling Car 62. Come in, please. Car 62, come in. Be on the lookout. Five-ton truck with brown canvas cover. Left the Mardi Gras Club ten minutes ago. The Baron of Roses picked up his load at the Mardi Gras Club ten minutes ago. Check with Micky at the Four-Mile Bridge and see if... Standby. I think he's coming now. - He made his last night run. - Yeah. He should've stuck to hauling bananas. Who's gonna tell her, Father? I think a woman should. I hear the sewing machine. She's working. She's holding up a piece of rose-colored silk. I think Assunta should tell her. I think she already knows what we have come to tell her. - Something is wrong. - What? What did you hear? Come, ladies, we must go inside. Don't speak. Don't speak. Don't speak. Don't speak. Don't speak. Don't speak. Don't speak. Please don't. Don't speak. Please don't. Don't speak. Don't speak. Don't speak, please. Don't speak. Don't speak. Don't speak. She's lost the baby. But Serafina's a strong woman. She's going to pull through this all right. But she's trying not to breathe. So she's got to be watched and not allowed out of bed. - You know how to give injections? - Yes. Needle. I use. - I know how. - Oh, fine. I'll get you some stuff. Doctor, I wanted to talk to you. The... The body. The body of the man must not be burned. Rosario's body was burned when the truck was burned. Deliberate cremation is not the same thing. She wants the body cremated so she can keep the man's ashes in the house. Well, if keeping the ashes in the house will be any comfort to her... But the body is dead. The body must be buried. Just a moment. Father. Where's the body? Who are you? Who are you? Please, who are you? - Estelle Hohengarten. - You cannot go in there. See him, I have to. - The body cannot be seen. - I have to see him. - You must go away, please. - I've gotta see him. - Please, you cannot go in there. - I've got to. - I've gotta see him. - No, the body cannot be seen. - I've gotta see him. - But you must go away, please. The widow knows nothing about you. - Assassina! - Vigliacca! Sporcacciona! Somebody stop the piano! Stop it! Stop it. Ferma! Ferma. Go home. My father is dead. Rosa, you're not going to have any fun at the dance unless you just forget all about your dress. Mama made five formals for other girls. She wouldn't make one for me. She said if my Daddy was living he wouldn't allow me to go to a high-school dance. But your father's been dead three years. You're grown up now. Rosa, you stop crying, or I won't go another step with you. I'm the only girl without a formal. Wait. Just a minute. I wanna fix your face. Lutie, this is Jack Hunter. - Hello. - How do you do? Who is that boy with Pauline Hunter? That's her brother, Jack. I think he's a dream of a dream. - Girls, this is Art Noble and Ray Brinn. - Hi. - Good evening, Rosa and Violetta. - Hello. Jack, I'd like you to meet Rosa Delle... Why did Rosa run away like that? She's all upset because she's not wearing a formal. Well, it's not important. Not all girls have formals. Excuse me. La tua voca gentile Piu non allieta il mio core Come le rose d'Aprile Le gioie d'amore... Rose? How do you know my name? What other name could it be? I'm not disappointed. Honest, I'm not. Well, I'm disappointed, sure, but... What I mean is, I... I respect you for it. Actually, I did want to let you kiss me. You know something? We're locked in this place. Locked? Mama will kill me. Hey, back there, did you really want to let me? I was scared to, though. - My heart was beating so fast... - You don't need to explain. - Maybe next time I... - When? When? Is tomorrow OK? Tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow is OK, OK, OK. Then tomorrow, I'll let you kiss me. Civics, you study civics... ...till a quarter past one? Yes, I study civics. Civics is very important, and tomorrow's the final. Oh, I know. I'm very tired, Mama. Help me unfold the sofa, will you? Come here, Rosa. Come on. Kneel to Our Lady and swear to me you study civics. No, I will not. Because you don't study no civics tonight. "Don't study no civics. " Why do you talk like you just came over in steerage? This isn't Sicily, Mother, and you are not a baroness. You do sewing. Daddy... Daddy hauled bananas. He hauled bananas and something under the banan... You don't study no civics no more. - Hey, where you going? - I'm going to Serafina house. Yesterday she don't give me the dress. She don't even open the door. We break in and get them. And to me, she said all week, "Domani, domani. " But yesterday I told her, you know. I says: "Wait, Serafina, domani is the high-school graduation, "and I gotta have the dress, because I gotta try it on my daughter. " Because my daughter got fat, and she's gotta give it to me today. Come on, let's go for the dresses. - Giuseppina, go open the door. - In just a minute. Serafina! Serafina Delle Rose! Serafina, we want the dresses! Rosa, take it off, or I tear it to ribbons. Mama, please. I've got to go to school. - It's the last day. - Take it off. - Let me at least go out for graduation. - Take it off. Now I'm mad! And she's gotta give me the dress whether she wants to or not. I'm going to give them their dresses. You ain't running out! OK? Rosa! Rosa! You know I don't understand Italian, so please. - Now, what's happening here? - Shut up. You know, we came here for the dresses... - She cut her wrist, my daughter! - Good heavens! Call the doctor, please, someone. Call the doctor. Come in! Mrs. Delle Rose, your daughter has not cut her wrist. - No? What? - Your daughter's all right. And you ladies, please, go away. We don't go without our dresses. The graduation begins, and the girls ain't dressed. Rosa. Come here. Show your mother - that you're not bleeding to death. - Let me see. Leave me alone. I'm so ashamed I could die. Yes, so ashamed. This is the way she goes around all the time. She hasn't put dress on since my father was killed. For three years, she never puts a dress on or goes out of the house, and now... Now she has locked up my clothes so I can't go out. She wants me to be like her, a freak of the neighborhood. The way she is! Next time I won't cut my wrist, but my throat! On parlare cosi! Mrs. Delle Rose, please give me the key to your daughter's clothes so she can dress for the graduation. Please, Serafina, give us our dresses, will you, please? Now, you ladies, please. I wanna chat with Mrs. Delle Rose. I know, I know. Well, you just wait outside. Thank you. Just a moment. Now, Mrs. Delle Rose, your daughter missed her final examinations. But her grades have been so good that she'll be allowed to graduate with her class and take the examinations later. You understand me, Mrs. Delle Rose? You see? I got a wild thing in the house. Now, let's not have any more outbursts of emotion. What? Outbur...? You make me sick. Sick at my stomach, you make me. Your school. You make all this trouble. You give this dance where she gets mixed up... Where she gets mixed up with a sailor. With a sailor. You're talking about Pauline Hunter's brother Jack, who attended the dance with his sister? - Attended with sister? - Yes. What sister? My... My daughter, she's nobody's sister. Don't listen to her, Miss Yorke. Don't pay any attention to her. - Rosa... - I'm ready to go now. She's lovely. Come kiss Mama, darling. Stop now. - Kiss mama once... - Leave me alone. Don't go like that! Please! Don't you dare come out looking like that! Rosa! How high is this high school where she gets mixed up with a sailor? How high is this high school? I will show you. It's high like that horse's dirt on the street. That's your high school! Scuola maledetta! - Scuola maledetta! - Mrs. Delle Rose, I don't understand how a woman that acts like you could have such a sweet and refined young girl for a daughter. Oh, my. Do you want me to talk refined, do you? Then do me one thing, please. Stop ruining the girls at the high school! - OK? - Serafina, look at yourself. All these ladies here, and you are not dressed. I'm dressed OK! I'm not naked! I'm so ashamed I could die. I'm so ashamed. Mama, you look disgusting. Yes, disgusting! Disgusting. Did you hear what...? What my daughter say to me? "You look disgusting. " She calls me disgusting. Serafina, now we must go in the house. Come on. Come on. How pretty she look, my daughter, in a white dress, like a bride. How pretty. Go away, please. Go away, please. Did you hear what my daughter called me? She called me disgusting. Disgusting. There, Serafina. Thank you very much. Thank you. Disgusting. Oh, the band. I go to the high school. I go to the high school. Shut up, you. I fail to understand why we have to take a chance missing the 12:00 just to pick up a blouse. I told you this blouse can mean the difference between a not-so-good and a very good time in New Orleans. Wait till you see how sexy. Where did I put the wristwatch? Is my blouse ready, honey? Oh, I'm late for the graduation of my daughter. - I can't find her graduation present. - Well, I'm late, too. - Come on, now. Where's the blouse? - Blouse? What blouse? Oh, no ready. I had to make 14 graduation dresses. You know? Well, now, a promise is a promise, and an excuse is just an excuse, now. Yeah, but I got to go to the high school now. Yeah, I know, but we gotta go to the convention in New Orleans. - Where is that wristwatch? - Here. Here. Here it is. Now, come on, woman. Get started and sew them bandanas together. If you don't do it, I'm gonna report you to the Chamber of Commerce and have your license revoked. What license you talking about? I have no license. You hear that, Flora? - She don't have no license. - No. She's operating against the law without no license? Yeah. I stitch them together, OK. OK. OK. OK. Train's pulling out! - You and your stinking blouse. - Flora. You know there's another one at 12:45. I fail to understand why it's so important for you to pick up a polka-dot blouse. - You make me sick. - Come on, now, Flora. Sit down. You're gonna wear your feet out before we get to the city. You let me worry about my own feet. I heard that the convention delegates caught a girl on Canal Street. - Yeah? - And they tore the clothes off her and sent her home in a taxi! I double-dog dare anybody to try that on me. You? You'd walk home. You two ladies, watch how you talk in here. This is a respectable house. Oh, well... ...excuse me. Polly want a cracker? No, he don't want a cracker. Polly, no. There's some delegates to the convention on the highway. - No kidding? - Yeah. Right there, see? Yell something at them! Mademoiselle from Armentieres - Parlay-voo - Parlay-voo Mademoiselle from Armentieres Parlay-voo Mademoiselle from Armentieres Hasn't been kissed in 40 years Look at that one. Isn't he cute? - Come on over here. - Come on out. I told you women. You are not in a honky-tonk. You. Take your blouse now and get out. Get out on the streets where you belong. This is the house of Rosario Delle Rose, and I won't have dirty talk in here. - Who's talking dirty? - Yeah, who is? You. You are. You are. Dirty talk. All the time, "Men, men, men. " - You two man-crazy things, you. - Sour grapes. Sour grapes is your trouble. You are just wild with envy. Come on, Bessie, let's get out of here. Forget the... Now just wait a minute. I don't accept insults from anybody. Hear? Go on. Go on the street and pick up a man on Canal Street, but not in my house at my windows. Here is the memory of my husband, with a... With a body like a young boy and skin on him smooth and sweet as a yellow rose petal. I'm satisfied to remember, because I had the best, and not the second best, but the only best, a rose. - A rose, was he? - A rose, a rose. Yeah, a rose of an Italian that got shot smuggling stuff under a load of bananas. Get out. Get out! I'm satisfied to remember the love of a man that was mine, only mine. Never touched by nobody. Nobody but me. Just me. - Never touched by nobody? - Nobody. Nobody but me. Well, I know somebody that could a tale unfold. And not no further than the Mardi Gras Club is. Estelle Hohengarten, the blackjack dealer from Texas. Bessie, get into your blouse, and let's get out of here. Well, everybody knows. All come out at the inquest. Serafina was laying there in bed with her eyes shut tight and the sheet pulled over her head like a... Like a female ostrich. Tie this blasted thing on me, will you? It was a romance too. Not no fly-by-night thing, but a real steady affair that went on for more than a year. Oh, leave her in ignorance. Ignorance is bliss. He had a rose tattoo on his chest, the stuck-up thing. Estelle was so gone on him that she went down to Bourbon Street and had one put on her too. Yeah, a rose tattoo on her chest, same as the macaroni's. - Liar! Liar! - Bessie, let's go. - Let's get out of here. - Let her howl her head off. You don't know what you're saying! - You don't understand! Liar! - A rose tattoo on her chest! - Police! - Liar! - Get out! - Murder! Police! - Get out! - Sour grapes! That's your problem. - Sour grapes! - Help! Murder! Police! I'm gonna have her arrested. I'm gonna call the police. I'm gonna have you arrested, hear? - Oh, leave. Let's go. - Have me arrested. You and your yellow rose petals. - Sour grapes! - Have me arrested. Sour grapes! Rosario, give me a sign. Tell me is not true. Rosario, tell me is not true. Tell me is not true. Lady, give me a sign. Tell me is not true. It's my money. I can spend it how I like. Well, pretend you didn't buy them for me. Tell Mama they're for her. You're sure dying for me to make a good impression on her, aren't you? She's got the wrong idea about you, that's why. Now, say the roses are for her. Please, Jack. Mama must have gone out. There is a key in the mailbox. - How do you know she's out? - The door was locked. And all the shutters are closed. Put down the flowers. Come here. I want to teach you a little Italian word. - The word is bacio. - Bacio? What's it mean? This. And this. Just think. A week ago Friday I didn't know boys existed. Did you know girls existed before the dance? I knew they existed. Do you remember what you said to me on the dance floor? "Honey, you are dancing too close. " Well, it was hot in the gym, and the floor was crowded. When my girlfriend was teaching me how to dance, I asked her, "How do you know which way the boy is going to move?" And she said, "You've got to feel how the boy's going to move with your body. " I said, "How do you feel with your body?" And she said, "By pressing up close. " That's why I pressed up close. I didn't realize that I was. You're blushing. Don't go away. And a few minutes later you said to me, "Gee, you're beautiful. " I said, "Excuse me," and I ran to the ladies' room. Do you know why? To look at myself in the mirror. For the first time in my life, I felt I was beautiful. You made me feel beautiful when you said I was. You are beautiful, Rosa. So much, I... Sta' zitta, cretina. - I knew somebody was in here. - Mama? - Are you there, Mama? - No, no. I'm not. I'm dead and buried. - Maybe I'd better go wait outside. - No. No, you stay right here. Mama... ...Jack is with me. Are you dressed up nicely? Why is it so dark in here? Jack, open the shutters. I want to introduce you to my mother. - Hadn't I better go out...? - No. Mama, you said you were dressed up pretty. Jack, stay out for a minute, huh? What's happened? What's happened, Mama? Look, put this on. So... So... Here. Here we are. Good. Let's fix your hair. There you are. Fine. Jack? Mama is ready to meet you. Mama, su. Su, Mama. Mama didn't sleep good last night. Mama, this is Jack Hunter. Hello, Mrs. Delle Rose. It sure is a pleasure to meet you. I was hoping to see you at the graduation, Mrs. Delle Rose. My sister was graduating. My mother was there, and my father. I... I was hoping you could all get together. Mama. Jack... Jack brought you some flowers. I hope you are as partial to roses as I am. Mama. Mama, say something. Say something simple, like, "Thanks. " Thanks. - I think your mama... - No. Oh, my diploma. Yes, show Mama my diploma. - Where is it? - It's on the table there, near the piano. Excuse me. I'll get it. Mama. Mama, what's happened? Can't you tell me, Mama? Is it because of this morning? Look, it's only a scratch. Forget it, Mama. Think it was just a bad dream that never happened. Here it is. Look what I got, my diploma. Father De Leo gave them out. - Diploma? - Si, right there. You got the diploma? Put it in the drawer, with your father's clothes. Mrs. Delle Rose, you should be very, very proud of your daughter. You know, Rosa was so pretty when she walked on the stage that people went: Just like that. Do you know what I mean? They all went: Because your daughter, Rosa, was so lovely-looking. How does it feel to be the mother of the prettiest girl in the world? Would you mind shutting up? Pazza. Shut the front door, please. There was a policeman come here because of some trouble. Mama, I've never seen you like this. What will Jack think? What do I care what Jack thinks? You wild, wild, crazy thing, you, with the eyes of your father. Yes, ma'am, you certainly got a right to be very proud of your daughter. I'm proud of the memory of her father. He was a baron. And who are you? - What are you? - Mama, I just introduced him. - His name is Jack Hunter. - Hunter? Yes, ma'am, Hunter. Jack Hunter. - What are you hunting, Jack? - Mama. Mama. What all of them are hunting. To have a good time, and the devils cares who pays for it. I'm sick of men, and I'm sick of women. You, Rosa, get out... till I talk to this boy, huh? - I didn't bring Jack here to be insulted. - No, it's all right, honey. It's all right. Go on, let your mama talk to me. I think your mama's just got a slight wrong impression. I got a... I got an impression. Well, I'll get dressed. Mama... Mama, please don't spoil it for me. The happiest day of my life. - Mrs. Delle Rose... - Delle Rose. - Mrs. Delle Rose... - Delle Rose. OK. I'm sorry about all this. Believe me, the last thing I had in mind was getting mixed up in a family situation. Look, I come home after three months at sea. My sister was going to a high-school dance, and she took me with her. And there I met your daughter. - What did you do? - At the dance? - We danced. - What did you do after that? We went to a place and had an ice-cream soda, chocolate. You mean you haven't been alone with my Rosa, huh? Alone or not alone, what's the point of that question? - I still don't see the point of it. - No. I'll show you the point. We are Sicilians. We don't leave the girls with the boys they are not engaged to. Mrs. Delle Rose, this is the United States. I know, but we are Sicilians. We are not cold-blooded. My girl is innocent, pure. She is, or she was. I would like to know which. Mrs. Delle Rose, I gotta tell you something. You may not believe it. It's a hard thing to say. Say it. Say it. Well, maybe I'm a sailor and all that, and the things they say about sailors... But all of us... I mean, a girl in every port and all. - No? - I haven't got a girl in every port. I haven't got a girl in no port, anyplace. What I'm getting at is... ...I am innocent too. What? No. - I don't believe it. - Well, it's true, though. This is the first time I really wanted to. Wanted to what? Make love. You, a sailor. Well, I had opportunities to, but... Well, I always thought of my mother. Well, I always asked myself, would she or would she not think this or that person was decent. But... But with my daughter, my Rosa, your mother tell you, "OK, go ahead, son. " Huh, no? Oh, Mrs. Delle Rose... Mrs. Delle Rose, I... She say she's in love. And you? You say you are in love? Yes, ma'am, I do. I'm in love, very much. Cretini. Tutti e due. I'm ready for Diamond Key. Get out on the porch, Diamond Key. Ale, ale. Ale. - Yes, Mama. - OK. - What are you, Catholic? - Me? Yes, ma'am. Catholic. - You don't look Catholic to me. - Mama, how do Catholics look? Do they look different from anyone else? You will stay out on the porch. Huh? - All right. - Thank you. Turn around, will you? - Do what, ma'am? - I said, turn around. Mama, what are you doing? Get out till I call you! Why do they make them Navy pants so tight? I don't know. That's a question you'll have to ask the Navy, Mrs. Delle Rose. Mama, will you stop asking so many questions? You see what I got? A wild thing in the house. Mrs. Delle Rose... Delle Rose, I guess Sicilians are very emotional people. I want nobody to take advantage of that. Look, you got the wrong idea about me, Mrs. Delle Rose. I know what men want. Not to eat ice cream with girls or dance on the floor, no. And boys are the same, only younger. - Come here. - Mama! Mama! Let me in the door, Jack! Mrs. Delle Rose, your daughter's calling you. Let her call. Don't worry about it. Come here. Come here. - You said you're a Catholic, ain't you? - Yes, ma'am. - Kneel down here. - Mama, now what? Go away, will you? And say after me what I say. What? Why? Why? I promise the Holy Mother - that I will respect the... - Mama! Today I kill you if you don't leave. - Are you gonna say it? - Yes, ma'am. OK. - Go ahead. - What was it again? I promise the Holy Mother... I promise the Holy Mother... That I will respect the innocence... That I will respect the innocence... Of the daughter Rosa of Rosario Delle Rose. Of the daughter Rosa of Mrs. Delle Rose. No, Rosario Delle Rose. Of Rosario Delle Rose. Get up. I'm satisfied. - Wonderful! - I'm satisfied. - Wonderful, Mama. - Let me breathe. Let me breathe. Let me go! Let me go! - No, please, Mama. - Crazy thing. Crazy... - Jack, kiss Mama. - Mama, kiss Jack. Won't kiss Jack! Won't kiss Jack! Are you crazy, kiss? Me? Me? Oh, my. Kiss my hand. - OK. - Mama, get some wine glasses. There, there. Oh, they're here. They're calling. Coming! Come on, Jack! Come on, Rosa! OK, OK! Goodbye, Mama. Goodbye. - Good night, Mrs. Delle Rose. - Goodbye, but... But the wine. Come on, let's go! The wristwatch. Where is it? Rosa! Rosa! Your little wristwatch! With seventeen jewels in it! Rosa! Rosa, Rosa. Rosa, Rosa. Oh, Lady, speak to me. Tell me it isn't true. Give me a sign. Give me a sign. Get your ice-cold lemonade. Fine soft drinks. N-37. N-37. Thirty-one. N-31. B-46. B-46. Serafina Delle Rose, come sta, cara? Come and sit down. I got to see Father De Leo. Where is Father De Leo? - Sit down, please. - No, I must find Father De Leo now. - Have a seat, lady. - I want you to meet my brother. - Pleased to... - Hello, hello. - Take my chair. - No, just find me the Father now. This is the bachelor brother I talk to you about. He is working. He is in his work clothes. I am sorry you should meet him like this in his work clothes. Yeah, I got a big load of bananas in my truck. - I bring the folks here, now I go. - Later, later. Later I come back to pick up the folks. Silence. Shut up, stupid. Speak English. You look tired. Here, sit down in the chair. Father De Leo! I'm sorry. - B-10! - Me, me. Bingo. Bingo, me. Bingo, bingo. Bingo. Father De Leo... - I got to see you, Father. - Why, Serafina? Let me talk to you, Father, please. Come away from here. You know these ladies. - I know, I know. Hello. - Serafina. But this is private, Father. You ladies, please, go. Play with the bingo. Thank you. Bingo! I can't talk here, Father. Come away from here. Calm yourself, Serafina. - We can talk in my office. - Yes, thank you. No. No, Father. Not through the church, please. - What's the matter? - Where I was married, no. Where you were married, where your child was baptized and confirmed. No, Father, please. Not through the church. Here. We can talk here. I fell down when I was married. Do you remember, Father? You collapsed at the altar. I had just come to this country. Do you remember? Yes, I remember. The marriage had been arranged by letter, exchanged between you and... You remember. I thought he would be ugly. I couldn't speak. I couldn't speak from the moment I saw him till the night after the marriage. Then I said only, "Oh, love. " "Oh, love. " I had married a rose. I didn't know I was going to marry a rose. I couldn't speak nothing in English except, "Oh, love. " "Oh, love. " "Oh, love. " Oh, Father! I can't breathe in this building. I can't breathe in this building where I was married, Father. Serafina. Serafina. I am not going to spare your feelings, Serafina. I'm gonna talk to you honestly, as your spiritual father. I am shocked. I am shocked at the change in your... In your appearance and behavior since the loss of your husband. Grief is a natural and dignified thing, but like every other emotion, Serafina, it can become excessive. Then... Then it becomes a sort of self-indulgence. I knew this was going to happen when you refused to obey the laws of the church and had your husband cremated. I remember you dressed in blue silk. Yes, yes. Like a lady wearing a piece of the weather. You walked tall and proud. Now, you crouch and you shuffle. You... You live and dress like a convict. You have no companions. You're rude to your neighbors. You don't mix with the women who... They make the life without glory. They make the life without glory. I gave my husband much glory. I was the peasant, but I gave him glory. I came to him with one dress, but I brought him glory. He was a baron, and I brought him glory. I brought him glory, glory. Glory. I don't believe that he took this glory I gave him and gave me horns. I don't believe he gave me horns, Father! What do you want from me? Go to the bingo. - Per I'amor di Dio. - Go! Serafina, the ladies only want to be your friends. Friendly? They think they know something that Serafina don't know. They think I have these on my head. But I ain't. No, I ain't! Serafina, I think you imagine too much. The ladies want to be your companions. Companions. Them ladies. The dummies I got in my house, they make much better companions, because they don't make up no lies. No, no. What kind of ladies are them women, huh? At 30 years old, they got no more use for the marriage, except for the money, the shoes, the food. - What do you call this kind of ladies? - Attenzione. To me the marriage was beautiful, like a religion. Now my marriage is dreams and memories only. And I don't believe that the man I keep in my heart gave me horns. I don't believe, no! I don't believe! I don't believe he gave me horns! The whole village is... Well, the whole village is laughing at you. Me too, I'm laughing. - Listen to me! I'm laughing too! - Serafina. - Laughing! - Serafina Delle Rose. - Why aren't you laughing anymore? - I think you had better go home. - Serafina. - No. I think you had better go home. Yes, I'll talk to you later. No. Later's too late, Father. You've got to tell me now. Tell you what? You used to... You used to hear the confession of my husband. Father, please, did my husband ever speak of a...? - Of a woman to you? - Serafina. Oh, Father, rispondetemi... ...this one question. Did he ever speak of a woman to you? - Serafina, how...? - Tell... - How can I tell you something I...? - Tell me, Father. You got to tell me. Serafina... - Father, tell me. Please, tell me. - Serafina. You know better than to ask me such a question. The secrets of the confessional are sacred to the priests. - I know. - They are never... - They are never repeated. - I know, but tell me. You got to tell me. - Tell me, Father. - Please, Serafina. Let go of me. Not till you tell me this question, this answer. I want it. I want it. Let go of me. Let go of me. - Tell me, I let go. - Let go of me. - You don't tell, I never let go. - Please. I go mad! I go crazy! I never let go! I never let go, Father. - I tell you, Father. - Mr. Mangiacavallo. Mr. Mangiacavallo, please help me calm this woman down. I'll speak to her later, when she's more calm. Father! Father! Oh, please. Please. Father De Leo! Father De Leo! Father De Leo, tell me please. Tell me, please. Tell me, please. Tell me. Tell me. Come on. You'll be all right. - Where am I? - This... This is my truck. It's OK. - No, where...? - You're OK. I drive you home from the church. You rest. I'm sorry I couldn't take you home in a taxicab. But I'm a bachelor with three dependents, I can't afford no cab fare. And you didn't have a purse with you. Oh, yeah. Where is my purse? - Did you have a purse with you? - I think so. I don't know. You want to go back and get it? - We'll look for it? - No, no, no. - You sure? - I want to go home, please. That's almost where you are now. When somebody else is crying I gotta cry too. I'm sympathetic. I got too much of a heart. Don't cry. Why should you cry? I know. It ain't like a man. Oh, a man sometimes has to cry like anyone else. You're very understanding. Sometimes a man has to cry the same as a woman. A man is not so different from anyone else. - Take it. - Oh, grazie. You stop that, then I'll stop too, huh? No, you stop first, and I'll stop. No, you first. Ladies first, you know? Ladies first. I stop. OK? OK, me too. I stop, see? Your shirt is torn, huh? Oh, yes, Mrs. Delle Rose. You tore it when I pulled you away from the priest. - Yeah? - Yeah. - I'll sew it for you. - Oh, that's nothing. It's nothing. - Forget it. - I'll sew it for you. Come on. I'm ready to laugh now. Oh, my. I'm sorry you lost your pocketbook, you know? How much money you got in the pocketbook? Much? Don't worry about it. Let me worry about it. Give me your shirt. And, please, will you open the shutters for me? - I can't see. - Oh, sure. Sure. A little bit. What, lady? The light on the body was like a man that lived here. - What? - Oh, my. Ma che strano. Your people, they come from Naples? - No, no. Sicily. - Sicily! Well, what's the matter? - Nothing. Nothing. - Che c'e? Nothing. Nothing. You got a bathroom in your house? - You got a bathroom in your house? - Of course we have a bathroom. - We don't have one at our house. - No? And I would like to wash up, because I think maybe I smell like a goat, you know? - Oh, please. Help yourself. - Grazie. - This way. - Con permesso. Prego. Oh, Madonna Santa. Madonna Santa, my husband's body with a head of a clown. A clown that smells like a goat. Oh, Lady. Lady, speak to me. Is it the sign, this? Oh, please. - Ciao! - Oh, ciao. You startled me. I washed up. I feel better. You feel better too? Yeah, much better, thank you. Now I cried, and I feel much better. That's good. Yeah, and now I can't get up. - You mean you can't get down. - I mean... Yeah, I can't get down. What's that you got in your hand? A bottle of vino? - What? - Vino. Is that vino? Yeah, Spumanti it is. Yeah. It comes from the house of the family of my husband. A very great family, you know. The Delle Rose. Barons. - Barons? - Yes. I... I was a peasant, but I married a baron. I married a baron when I didn't have shoes. Oh, shoes. What shoes? You had three very sweet things. Heart, face and figure. And even a baron's human. - You know, like a truck driver. - Yeah. - I sew the shirt now for you, huh? - OK. I'm a very frank person. I'll tell you something. My old-maid sister, she wanted us to meet each other. - Yeah? Why? - Well, she says, "This very nice lady, this widow, this baronessa, "she's lonely and you're lonely. Why don't you get acquainted?" She wanted us to meet each other before this time, you know? - Really? - Yeah, really. I'm a frank person, too, and I'll tell you something now. You can tell your sister I don't need to meet nobody, because my husband is with me. We are not separated. I turn around, and I see my husband here with me in this... Bottle? Bottle. Urn. Marble urn. Come here. You see, the ashes of the rose that I keep in my heart. I'm sorry, I... No, it's nothing. The priest was against it. It broke the laws of the church. I know. But I had... I had to have something. And this was all I could have. I think God has forgiven. What makes you think that God has forgiven? - I know him. - You know him? I know him. He has forgiven. You'll see. Nobody knows how lonely someone can be. There's nothing wrong with it. The body would've decayed, but the ashes always stay clean, you know? Gentle. You see, this is our wedding picture. Hey. Che bell'uomo. Yeah, a rose of a man, my husband. A rose, a rose. On his chest he had a rose tattoo, you know? - A rose tattoo? - Yeah. - No. - A rose tattoo. - Let me see. - Oh. "Let me see. " - "Let me see. " - Yeah, right. Do you believe strange things? I would like to tell you something, but I got to speak frankly, you know? Speak frankly. We're both grown-up adult people. Yeah. You know, my husband, he had this rose tattoo on his chest. One night I woke up with a burning pain on me here. I turned on the light in the bedroom, and I looked in the mirror. On my breast, I saw the rose tattoo of my husband. On me here, his tattoo. - Strano. - Yeah. And this was the night that... - Yeah, but I got to speak frankly. - Speak frankly. Come on. That was the night that I got my son. The little boy that I lost when I lost Rosario. - When I lost my husband. - Strano. Ah, si. Che davvero. Would you be willing to show me the rose tattoo? - What? - Well... It's gone now. Oh, please. It only lasted a moment, but I saw it so clearly. So clearly, I saw it. - You believe me? - Si, si. Lo credo. Maybe it could be back, no? I don't know why I told you, you know? - Well, I just... - Only because I liked what you say. That bodies decay, but the ashes always stay clean. Immacolato. But there are some people... Oh, there are some people, they want to make everything dirty. Everything dirty, believe me. Two of them kind of people come in the house today and told me a terrible lie... about my husband. So terrible a lie that if I thought it was true, you know, I would smash it. Smash the urn, like... - Like this! - No, no, lady. - Not the wine. - Oh, no. - Not the wine. - Not the wine. No, don't be afraid. Not the wine. Not the wine. - Will you open the wine for me? - Sure, sure. - Thank you. Oh, my head. - What...? Well, what kind of a lie did they tell you? No, no, no. I don't want to talk about it. I don't believe the lie. I don't believe the lie. The memory of the rose in my heart is perfect. Oh, I like a lady that laughs with all her heart. And a lady that cries with her heart? I like everything a lady does with her heart. - Look at your face! - I know! - Here. - What's happening? Hey, you kids! Get off of that truck! Keep your paws off of them bananas! Oh, I forgot. - You haul bananas? - Si, signora. I was supposed to get my truck into Biloxi an hour, two hours ago. It's a five-ton truck? - A three-ton truck. - Three? My husband hauled bananas in a five-ton truck. - Well, he was a baron. - He was... - Yeah. Did you haul just bananas? - Just bananas. What else? My husband hauled bananas, but underneath the bananas was something else, you know. Oh, he was wild like a Gypsy. He was wild like a Gypsy. Where did I hear that before? He was wild like a Gyp... I hate to start to remember, you know? And then not to remember, you know? I better call my boss in Biloxi, explain how come I'm so late. - It's a long-distance call? - Don't worry about it. No, no, please. I don't worry about it. You will pay. - Hello, operator? - Umber, please. Get me the Southern Fruit Company in Biloxi, 2-4-6-8-1. That's right. - Yes, sir. - Oh, my number is 6-6-9-9. That's right. You know, you got a nice, cozy little home-like place here. Yeah. How is the place where you live in? I got a place with three dependents in it. The line is busy. - Prego. - Hey, grazie. What dependents? - Is good Spumanti. - This is good. Well, there's... There's the one old-maid sister, one feeble-minded grandmother and one lush of a pop who ain't worth the powder it takes to blow him to... Scusatemi. You know, they got the Parchesi habit. - Yeah? - They play the game of Parchesi morning, night and noon. And they pass the cans of beer around the table. They got the beer habit too? And the numbers habit. You know, this spring my old-maid sister, she gets some kind of lady trouble. Mostly mental, I think. And she turns the housekeeping over to the feeble-minded grandmother, who's a very sweet old lady, but who don't think it's necessary to pay the grocery bills as long as she's got money to play the numbers. She plays the numbers. She's got a perfect system, but it don't ever work. And the grocery bills go up, up, up so high you can't see them. - I better try my boss again. - Yeah. I'll tell you my hopes and dreams. - Who, me? - Operator. The number, please. Oh, excuse me. Hello, operator? The Southern Fruit Company in Biloxi, 2-4-6-8-1. - That's right. - May I have your number? My number is 6-6-9-9. - 6-6-9-9, that's right. - Yes, sir. I'm hoping to meet some sensible older lady, you know? I don't care if she's a little bit too plump or not such a stylish dresser. The important thing in a lady is understanding. - Good sense, you know? - Yeah. And I want her to have a nice, well-furnished house and a profitable little business of some kind. I see. And... ...such a lady, with a well-furnished house and business, what does she want with a man with three dependents and the Parchesi and the beer habit, plays the numbers? Oh, my! Love and affection in a world that... That's lonely and cold. Yeah, it might be lonely, but I would not say cold on this particular day. Love and affection is what I got to offer on hot or cold days in this lonely old world. I got nothing else. - Mangiacavallo has nothing. - Who? - Me! Alvaro Mangiacavallo. - Oh, yeah. You know, Mangiacavallo means "eat a horse". You know this. But I don't have a horse to eat, not even a chicken. I'm the grandson of the village idiot of Riveri. - Oh, I see you like to make jokes now. - No, no. No joke. Davvero! He chased my grandmother in a flooded rice field. She slipped on a wet rock: Ecco, here I am. Oh, please. You should be more respectful, you know? What have I got to respect? The rock my grandmother slips on? Yourself at least. You don't work for a living? Hey, if I don't work for a living I would respect myself more. - Yeah? - Baronessa, I'm a healthy young man. Hey, I exist without no genuine love life. I look at them pictures in the magazines... Them girls in the advertisements, you know what I mean. They got a little bitty thing here, a little bitty thing there. That's all they need, they're so skinny! Yeah. It's a long-distance call, you know. Is the line busy? - Not the line, the boss. - The boss. Get your boss on the phone or hang up. - OK, OK. - Hello. Pilade talking. Oh, hello! Oh, hello, Mr. Pilade! How's things at the Southern Fruit Company this hot afternoon? Yeah, Mangiacavallo! - I got a complaint about you. - What? Well, what complaint? - What happened? - I tell you. Over three hours ago, Joe passed the church and seen your truck parked with the bananas and you playing bingo. Ow, you get them bananas here. You're fired, you hear? - What? - Drive your truck for somebody else. Mr. Pilade! Well, wait a minute, Mr... - What's happened? - What's happened? A man with three dependents out of a job. And my truck ain't even paid for. I can't see no more. I got a suggestion to make you, huh? Open that drawer, and you will find a package with a shirt in it. - This one? - You can wear it and call for this one later. - There's a name on it. - No, don't tell me the name, please. Throw it away. Out the window. Ecco fatto. Seta! Seta puro! Oh, this shirt's too good for Mangiacavallo. Everything here is too good for Mangiacavallo. Nothing's too good for a man, if the man's good. Put it on. You are welcome to it. - Bella? - Oh, bella. - Can I...? - Sicuramenti. Prego. - How does it feel, the silk on you? - Just feels like a girl's hands on me. It will make you less trouble, believe me. You know, there's nothing more beautiful than a gift between people. - No? - Yeah. You like me a little better now, huh? You know what they should have done when you was a baby? - What? - They should have put tape on your ears... to hold them back. Like this. Lookit. Is not much better, huh? So when you grow up, they wouldn't stick out like the wings of a little kewpie. Lady, lady! The black goat is loose again! II becco della strega. Look at my tomatoes. Look at my...! Oh, the strega. She has a demon eye, you know. Now, don't get excited. Don't worry. I will catch the black goat, and I'll give him a kick he'll never forget. Come on! Come on! I got a friendship with goats. Come on! It was nothing. Oh, no. Please. Look. Oh, my. In here. Yeah. - OK. - You're troppo gentile, signora. Delle Rose. Signora Delle Rose. I have to go now. I know, I know. Please. Please. Wonderful. Oh, wonderful! Excuse the way I'm not dressed. I'm not always like this, no. Sometimes I fix myself up, yeah. When my husband was living, when my husband comes home... When he was living, I had a clean dress on, you know? And sometimes even... Even I put a rose in my hair. A rose in your hair would be pretty. Oh, yeah, but not for a widow. It's not the time of roses. Why? You make a mistake. It's always for everybody the time of the roses. - Yeah? - The rose is... The rose is the heart of the world like the... Like the heart is the heart of the body. How's that? Good, eh? But you, baronessa, you know what I think you have done? - What have I done? - You have put your heart in the marble urn with the ashes. Oh, yes. And if in a storm sometimes, or sometime if a five-ton truck goes down the highway and the marble urn was to break... Look! Look, baronessa! Look what? I don't see. I was pointing to your heart. Broken out of the urn! Rondinella felice! Rondinella felice! Che buffone. I take you serious, and you make jokes. Your heart is a happy bird. When I can bring the shirt back? - When you pass by again. - I'll come back tonight, volete? OK. Then look at the window tonight. If the shutters are open and there is a light in the window, you can stop by for your shirt. But if the shutters are closed, you better not stop because my Rosa will be home. - Rosa? - Yeah. Rosa's my daughter. There's nothing wrong in two grown-up people having a quiet conversation, but Rosa's 15. I must be careful to set her a perfect example. - I will look at the window! - OK. I will look at the win... - Bang, bang! - Hey, you little monkey. - Get down off that truck. - Go chase your head! Come on. Come on. Get down. Here we go. Come on. Jump! You little monkey, you lay off of them bananas. They're the property of the Southern Fruit Company. Of which I am no longer a truck driver. Ciao. Hey, you! Oh, Rosario, forgive me for thinking the terrible lie could be true. Forgive me. You're in a mood. You act disgusted with me. Ever since you met Mother, you've acted different. How different? Cold. Honey, your mother made me understand the responsibility of... - Of what? - Loving a very young girl. I'm old enough to get married. Married? Yes! Married and have a baby. That's something to dream of. You dream. I am not a dreamer. I am not satisfied with dreams. Look, they can see us. Lift the anchor and take the boat out further. Miss Yorke has field glasses. Field glasses! Field glasses! Well, they're German military field glasses with 20 magnification. Field glasses! - Alvaro, what happened? - You didn't get enough games today? - Oh, che bello! - Here, wrap this up, quick. Subito. - What? What? - I borrowed it from the widow. - How's the Parchesi today? - Oh, she cheats me. Sei tu che sei un imbroglione! - Imbroglione? - On giochi bene, te I'ho detto! - Onna, gioca. Tocca a te. - Stupido! Anche tu! Anche tu! Perche' gli lasci prendere la-tua cravatta? Ma perche' tu imbrogli sempre, imbrogli sempre? On lo vuoi capire. - Hello. - Oh, hello. You...? You Mama Shigura? You want tattoo? Portrait? No. Tattoo. But can you do it now? Because I ain't got a lot of time. OK. Very fast. Very good. Formerly New Orleans. Formerly Galveston. Formerly Yokohama. Very good. I want a rose tattooed here, here on my chest. You understand? A rose. OK. Six dollar. Oh, no. That's too much. I give you $2. OK. Four dollar. No stem. Just a rose. Two-fifty is all I got to spend on a rose tattoo, see? I'll show you. OK. Very good. Take off shirt. Sit down. But you got to make me a nice, big, beautiful rose, huh? But for $2.50, no leaf, no stem. Just the rose. - The rose is all I need. - OK. It's cold! I give you a little stem. Where is it? Where is it? Eccola qua. Quarda dov'era. Rondinella felice! I will look at the window! C'e nessuno? Anybody home? Sono qua. Here I am. Where you go? - Well, good evening. - Good evening. - Well! - What? Say, you... Hey! - You... Look, your hair... - What's...? What's the matter, huh? I didn't expect to see you looking so pretty. You're a young little widow, you know? - You are... Fix yourself up. - Yeah. I went to the Ideal Barbers. I got the whole works, including the bath. - No! - Yeah. Magnifique! Oh, you got oil of roses in your hair. Si, si! Olio di rose. - You like the smell of it? Smell it. - Yeah, yeah. I like the smell of it. You don't like the smell of it. I'll wash it out. I'll take it off. I like it! I like it! I like. I like the smell of it. I like. OK. Shall we sit down in the parlor, huh? I guess that's better than standing up in the kitchen, no? I think so. OK. OK. Oh, hey. Let me help you. I'll take it. I'll take it. Oh, grazie. Oh, excuse me. Ladies first. Shall we...? Shall we sit down on the sofa? Yeah. You... You take the sofa. I will sit down on this chair. But it's more easy to talk with two on the sofa. Yeah, but I lean back too far on that sofa, and I like a straight back behind me, you know? But it's more easy to talk with two on the sofa. You know what I mean? I talk just good on this chair as I talk on that sofa. Sit down, please. - Oh, can I help you? - Oh, no. I'll put it over there. - It's all right. - Thank you. - I got a good surprise for you. - Yeah? - Wait till you see. - No! Oh, my purse. - Father De Leo had it in his office. - Oh, thank you. Open it. Count the money. - Why should I count the money? - You're rich, and I'm poor. How do you know I didn't steal from you? Oh, such an idea. I would never think such a thing. I would never dream of it, believe me. I want you to know that I may be honest, but I'm poor. I'll put away the purse. - Excuse me, eh? - Sure. - Good evening again. - Good evening. Good evening. I bet you counted the money, huh? Yeah. I see you like make jokes again, huh? - I got another surprise for you. - No. What? - For you. - Oh, no! Chocol... Chocolate... Chocolates... Thank you, but, you know, I'm too fat to eat candy. - Oh, no. - I can't. Oh, no. You're not fat. You're just pleasing and plump, you know? Yeah. - Don't make me nervous now, huh? - All right. Thank you. Thank you. - It's all right. - Thank you. Bella. Oh, I see you got a piano. Yeah, yeah. But I never touch it, no. It's electric. You know, I don't understand it. I think it might give me a shock. - I'm afraid of this. I'm afraid. - There's no... There's nothing to it. I'll show you. - It's very simple. - Don't touch it! - You press this. - Don't touch! I can't stop now. I'm afraid, oh... Look at... He's crazy, he's... Oh, my! Will you stop the dance?! Please! Oh, look! Chiudi quella finestra! Ma che modi! Chiudi quella finestra! - A guardano! - Oh, yeah, yeah. OK. Dio mio! Turn on the lights! - What? What? - Turn on the lights, please! Turn on the lights! I can't hear you! Sit down like a gentleman, or go home like a clown! - Oh, scusatemi, baronessa! - Va bene! - I like the music too much. - Sit down! OK. Take it easy. Take it easy. Sit down. Oh, I'm afraid now. Oh, now, don't be afraid. It's easy. Look. There you are. OK. Oh, please. Look at this. I got a daughter, 15, no? - Fifteen daughters? - Yeah, 15 daughters. Age 15. One daughter. Clown! - I just make a joke. - Yeah, I see. I see. - Oh, excuse me. - May I now? - Well, I'm so nervous tonight. - Here, let me help you. Why are you nervous? - Because she's going out with a sailor. - Your daughter? Yeah. Sit down, please. No, no. Not here. Over there, over there. I made him promise to respect the innocence of my Rosa. But how do I know that he will respect the promise, you know? Oh, baronessa, you got to face facts. Sooner or later the innocence of your daughter cannot be respected if the family's gonna continue, you know? Please, don't make comparisons, huh? Did he have a tattoo? Did who have a what? "Did who have a...?" The sailor. The sailor your daughter has met, did he have a tattoo? Why do you ask me if he had a tattoo? Well, you know, most sailors have got tattoos. How do I know if he had a tattoo or not? Are you crazy? - I got a tattoo. - No, really? Yeah! Oh, you make me laugh. What kind of a tattoo you got? - What kind do you think? - Oh, it's easy. A South Sea girl without clothes on. - Oh, no, no. - I'm sure. - I'm sure. - No South Sea girl without clothes on. - No? - No, no. A big, red heart with "Mama". "Mama" written across it. You're wrong again, baronessa. - What kind of tattoo you got? - I show you. See? Well, what's the matter? - I'm sorry. - What's the matter? I don't feel good. Oh, I'm sorry, I... - I got to go outside. - I'm sorry, baronessa. I got to go outside to breathe, please. Mi dispiace molto. I didn't mean to surprise you. Don't talk about it. Anybody could have a rose tattoo. It don't mean nothing. - Sure, I know. - You know, I can't breathe. It's too hot tonight. You know how a tin roof is. Yeah, I know. It catches the sun all day, - and it don't cool off until midnight. - Yeah. Then it gets hot in the bedroom, and the covers, they... No, please! Please. We got a strega. A witch next door. Please! Please don't touch me! You got a bright house. - You're burning kilowatt hours. Why? - That's all right. You don't have to pay the light bill. Please! Yeah, I know. But don't you feel self-conscious with all the light on? Everybody looks in. They watch us. They see what we do. Nothing is going on here to be ashamed of. - Nothing. - Nothing! Nothing. Yeah. What are you doing that for now? You know, the night is warm, but my hands are freezing. - Bad circulation. - Too much circulation. I feel the sweet warmth of a lady. You know? You talk a sweet mouth to fool a... - To fool a woman, huh? - No, no, I know. That's what warms the world, what makes it summer. Without it, the rose wouldn't grow on the bush. The fruit wouldn't grow on the tree. And the truck would not haul the bananas, Mr. Mangiacavallo, I know! What, you don't like my poetry? No, I don't like your poetry! How can a man talk to you?
