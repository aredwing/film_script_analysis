Presents A Popcorn Film Production Kwon Sang-woo Yoo Ji-tae Son Byung-ho Executive Producer Kim Woo-taek Jeong Tae-sung Producer Han Sung-goo Running Wild I really wanted to be friendly with you, but the bribe story makes me annoying. Anyway I don't worry about anything. Dan-su. It's just small one. Have you sent files to your company? I don't need all of them. I just need some profiles... whose makes me irritating. I always feel ashamed that I haven't done two things in here. One is I haven't had eels in here, and the other one is I haven't sent you to jail. I always respect you, prosecutor. There are my bros want to beat you. I do my best, you should know that. I also worry about you. I think of you a mob with loyalty, I make my detectives go-easy who want to crush you. I also do my best, you should know that. Well, well, don't bite and fight each other. Or... Yakuza Fujumoto Shinske, who won the Korean medal of honour. You guys play with them recently supplying drugs, recently President Heo! You know some Japanese accents. Wanna get beaten? You've got a iron-stomach? Let me get you some sharp one! Who the fuck are you? - Get down! - Don't move! You know Prosecutor Jo, my rookie! They must be taken! Plus Bribe! - You little! - Stand still. - Let go! - You really want this? Here, you like paper works! Oh! You must be get paid. See you in Seoul. Hello. What happened with arm? You got Mom's vest? The thick one? - Hurt badly? Huh? - I'm fine. Give me that vest. Please get bastards with your mouth not your body. How come you always get scars and bruised? That's enough. - Let me get this in a bag. - Fine! Why? This is mom's favorite one. On the way you go, get a brand-new one and chage it. Enough. She's my mom. Are they a bunch of pigs or what? Look at this disastrous table! Is this a ashtray? That ignorant bastard, they are not my customers any more. Sick bastards! I'm going. D You put me down to the world and go away... d And time goes on... Do-young? I feel like dying. Listen! If you go to heaven, I will follow you. Don't even think about it! Alright? GO! GO! Hurry up! Go! Go! The direct cause of death is a fractured forehead. It's not a suicide. You sent us the dental record of a missing person 3 years ago. It's a match. It's PARK, the boss of the Dokang Family. After he went missing, CHO his right arm, took over the Family. The motive must be a power game. You're already on a case? You haven't changed. I gotta hand it to you. You know what I nicknamed him? Mr. Urologist' He lays his hand on a case it gets bigger and bigger. This case has been closed due to lack of evidence. You sure? We have a case. Why didn't you make a baby while staying down there? Boxes of documents! Is he after all the thugs in Korea, or what? Is it lopsided? Everybody says he's a tight ass. Is he? Gangsters used to shiver at the mention of his name. the Kingpin... ...when he was green. But during the interrogation... ...names of those up there were mentioned. So he ended up getting transferred to the boondocks. We should be more flexible to survive in the world. The cleaning works will be finished in afternoon. Yu Gang jin How are PARK's wife and kids? I've been looking after them. Don't worry. Thanks. Welcome back, Boss! It's not a good sight. Move them. I'm sorry, sir. I meant to make this quiet. Come on, move! So many thugs here! On a field trip to the joint? Who the fuck are you? A homicide detective, asshole. What are you, the Mob? Shooting the Godfather? Going to jail is no freaking medal. - Watch it, asshole! - CHO! So you're a detective? We don't want any trouble. You have my apology. Come on, let's go. They were out of tofu. That's made from beans, too. Let's get you a suit first. You'd been working in Japan. Tell Mom that. Mom? What's going on? What's this? What's wrong with Mom? I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Mom. It's okay. I'm sorry, Mom. - It's okay. - I'm sorry. Hang out with those punks again and I'll kill you. Putting me back in jail? I'm not a fool. I know you ratted on me then. But I never held a grudge. I knew you didn't do it to screw your half brother. You did it for my sake. Okay then. My old man and yours... They gave Mom hell while they were alive. And you're gonna let her die like that? I can't. Damn, you've grown up. Yeah, I'm incapable. I wanted to be happy, too like everybody else. Eating out on the weekends... Three of us playing cards on holidays... You know I tried. - It didn't work. - We gotta save her. You watch me. I won't let her die. You think I'm complaining? Maybe I should. You never think of anything but your job. I'm working on a big case. I can't afford to mess it up. When it's over we'll go on a trip or something. You know what? I'm asking for a divorce! You're married to your job anyway, not me. - It won't do anything for us! - For me, it will. Let's get it over with ASAP. Anyway, I can't do it anymore. It depends on my life! My own life! Don't you dare to say 'life'. It's just works to do. If that's you life, what am I? I respect you from when I was student. I must just respect you, at that time. Enough! I still think that you are a great prosecutor. Jeong-min! I hate being an annoying wife any more! Jeong-min! I want to leave you with the little pieces of respect. Please let me go. Please... You... - You show him the contract? - He won't sign it. Is that so? Look, YOO. You don't scare me. This is no negotiation. What are you doing? Well, Min? I don't want it! You're asking for it, man. Bro! No, Detective! I'm freaking sorry. Bro. You even get drunk from coke for God's sake. I could've pulled it off, but... - Sober the hell up! - For mom's surgery! I could've gotten the money. I thought I got it. She needs surgery to live but we're broke! I never do anything right! Asshole! Look, shut your hole. Stay put here. - How much? - Hold on. Lotto... Damn lotto. Sir! Dong-jik? Wake up. Wake up, asshole! Ambulance... We need an ambulance. Call 911! We're from the Prosecutor's Office. Please be cooperative in the scene. Where's Dong-jik? He left on business. What business? Gone abroad again? Don't worry about him. Worry about yourself. He's still a kid. Look after him. Mom. Have you ever been happy in your life? I don't know. Never? What about before you got hitched? You're so pitiful. To me, you are. We both are. Aren't we? You and I are both pathetic. Let's go. Let's go. Did you call me? The bars we investigated last week were the faint ones. The black lental-money had been traded. But we haven't got any crucial info. They made double-account book, and made a lot of profits, we are late. They noticed we know something. to the detective Kang. Transferred by O-song company, Song Dae-kyun. Which supply some alcohol to the Do-gang's bars right? When did you come? Why are you so long-faced? I won't be able to come here for weeks, Care for my mom. What's this? Get her some foods and beverages. Well, I had that amount money. She's my mom, why do I get your help? Just because she's like my mom, ok? I am asking for a favor, caring for her, alright? Where's Dong-jik? Call him, get him in here. I'm ok, I'm fine, but... If she feels lonely, no one can replace her family. You are my family. I'm going. Black Grandeur with Seoul plates ending in 84. This is it. Forget it. I can print it out for you. Can you pull out a list of lefty criminals using knives? Someone stole your money? This so isn't you, man. - Can you, or not? - No need to yell, man. Wait. Where the hell have you been? The Lee case, it can be worse. I don't care. Mr. Lee, the moustache guy, you did crashed him by car. He's about to sue you Go to the hospital, and apologize to him Furthermore, get a mutual agreement. I don't give a shit about it. What? Don't give a shit? You let the IA in the office because of the gun-shooting Shit! I'll quit! I'm out! Alright? Whoever say something to me they are dead! Looks like right... or not... Maybe, or maybe not. Asshole! Yes, that's him! That's the guy. - Don't waste my time. - Okay, I won't. He's a lefty, isn't he? If he jerks off with a left hand! How should I know? - Sir. - You... - Call him. - Uncuff me then. Come on, this is unnecessary. Uncuff me. You find it fun cuffing me? You're a cop, so what? Be a cop then. Asshole! If you change your words later... You're dead. Detective JANG? Detective? Uncuff me, pig! Detective? Where are you going? Son of a bitch! I'll fucking sue you, asshole. Have fun taking a bus home. A rat is approaching the target. An informer, maybe? BAE Kwang-chun! You know why I'm here, don't you? All I want is BAE. So stay the fuck out. Now I recognize you. What are you doing here, Detective? What should we do? Should we move in? - Let's. - Come on! Why'd you kill Dong-jik? Watch it. - The badge won't protect you. - Get the fuck out of the way! Cops are here! Run! Stop right there, fuckers! Let's go! Get back here! Get back here, fuckers! Fuck! Get up! Don't move! - Hold still! - Let go, fuckers! Fuck! Come on, I'll kill you all! Pin him down! Sons of bitches! I'll kill you all! - What's this? - He's a cop! What'd you want BAE for? Do cops need a reason to bust thugs? I bust thugs when I see one. We staked out here for 4 days. We needed evidence to indict them. And you ruined it for us. Not everything works out in your favor. Forget about it. Got a light? Listen. This isn't about arresting one petty thug. You want to score? Look somewhere else. If I was sane and reasonable... ...I would suck up to you Mr. Prosecutor. But I have a reputation around here. As a crazy bastard! You listen. That motherfucker is mine. You got that? Look somewhere else Mr. Prosecutor. You're no different from a thug. Fax an official request to... Two things that I hate the most. One is: Cockroaches. The other: Thugs. And you just called me a thug? Who do you think you are taking to him like... - BANG. - Yes? You smoke, don't you? I do, but I'll quit. What the... Mr. YOO Kang-jin was once known as the President of the underworld. Paroled recently, he says he converted to Christianity. Having established a facility under his firm, Guryong Industries... ...he's committed to helping the less fortunate. Did you contact Senator HONG? Yes, we know what he wants, sir. Don't sir me when we're alone. I'm okay, sir. I don't feel comfortable. We're friends from childhood. How much does he want? A lot of developers are after that project. To eliminate the competition and bribe officials... He's asking for Big Five. He'll pocket half of it, though. We need him, after all, on this. Sir! Sir... Sir! - CHO. - Sir? Something's bothering me. Prosecutor OH Jin-woo... I think he's after you. - He's a bad ass. - I didn't mess up. I've been loyal to you, sir. You know that. That's why I'm in a dilemma. Should I kill you? Or him? Let me tell you an old saying. It's a golden rule. No matter how good you are never fight against the government.' Yes. That's true. Isn't it? Sir! Sir? Sir! Sir! Let me live! No! Let's go. Sir? I know what you wanna say. Unless they betray me, don't desert them. That's my principle. When he comes to tell him to go under till I call him. Yes, sir. What do you mean it's out of the question? Didn't I tell you? CHO has gone under. I just want the list of those connected to his Family. What'd you just say? Forget it, asshole! The youth hold our profound future. I'll focus on helping the needy. That's a meaningful life. From now on, I will hold charities like this as often as possible. But you understand that there are people doubting your intentions. There's nothing I can do about it. I'm just doing what I can to contribute to society. - Please, comment on... - Excuse me. - One more question, sir. - Excuse us. Excuse me. We have suspects who might've killed your husband. We're working on it. We just need more time. I'm glad to have found his body thanks to you. What brings you down here? A month ago... A young man came to see me right before the funeral. He asked for money. He said he had evidence of my husband's murder. - Go screw yourselves. - Detective JANG! Look! - Lose the attitude. - 'Lose the attitude.' I'll quit, okay? Fuck Internal Affairs! Stop it! Cool it, will you? They're suspending me! He's completely out of control. You fucking suits have no idea what it's like out there. Watch your language! It'll be included in the report. Include this, too! Detective JANG! That moron... Damn it. What are you doing here? Isn't this place too humble for you? Cops can't beat up suspects. If you're here to screw me, take a number. Just keep in mind that the line is quite long. One shot is $100 Gs. Don't you want it? You need money for your mom. What the fuck! What the fuck is this? You think I take bribes? Sit. I need a man. One that can't be bought. So what? You want me to be your minion? You're after BAE. It's for LEE Dong-jik, isn't it? You know he's a hit man for the Dokang Family. I'd be better off having you on my side than letting you get in the way. What I want is the Dokang Family. We can nail both CHO and BAE as a package. I need a light. Come on. What about the suspension? I'll have it lifted if you join my team. One more thing. We go strictly by the book. Then by my orders. So you'd like to keep me on a short leash? - If you don't like it, forget it. - You called me a thug. What changed your mind? You refused this. It was too little. This might do. He did 25 months for assault and blackmailing. I know he didn't do it. - He was a watcher. - Was he your informant? I just knew him. I put him in jail. He asked PARK's wife for money. He must've known something. That's what got him killed. LEE Dong-jik? LEE Dong-jik... We didn't share the cell. I only saw him during exercise hours. But I hardly knew him. You were in together for a year. And you two were friends from outside. I said I knew nothing. - Don't fuck with us, asshole! - Let go of him. Words won't do. Fists will! Let go of him! Listen to him. Stop shaking your legs! He got killed right after he was released. Tell us whatever you know. Little things help. Dong-jik... Now thinking about it, he had a lot of visitors. - Visitors? - On behalf of the cell leader. There were so many eyes. He was an errand boy. - Was the cell leader from the Dokang Family? / - No. It was YOO Kang-jin, the boss of the Guryong Family. They got released on the same day. You didn't know? LEE Dong-jik was a petty hand in the Dokang Family. He did 25 months in prison. And he got killed by BAE soon after the release. The motive? I believe he got hold of evidence to the PARK's murder. He blackmailed them for money and got killed. You have evidence? We're working on it. Are you sure? He was a petty hand. Don't be mistaken. He was an errand boy for someone while in jail. YOO, the boss of the Guryong Family. PARK was the boss of the Dokang Family. As you all know they go way back. They were friends when they were local punks. However, YOO was smarter and more decisive. As the Guryong Family expanded... ...they clashed a lot. he was found dead. YOO is getting himself acquainted in the political circle. It's either to acquire concessions, or he has another agenda. YOO Kang-jin is behind the murders of PARK and LEE Dong-jik. And the killer, CHO has gone under. - YOO gave the order. - Look, Jin-woo. If YOO is a major leaguer, PARK was a minor leaguer. What would he kill PARK for? Whatever it was, we'll know soon. He isn't what he was. He's a respected businessman now. He's in the press's spotlight for all his charity work. Any evidence? Any witnesses? You don't wanna rock the boat for nothing. Jin-woo. I know there's bad blood between you two, but let it go. What do you mean? You touched him 3 years ago and got screwed. - Trying to get back at him? - What? Locate CHO first. And check out the members of the Dokang Family. We'll see about YOO. - Sir! - Jin-woo, one step at a time. Let's make this quiet. Okay, what's next? He get crushed ASA disappearing Mr. Park 3 years ago. He felt guilty and just disappeared, right? I don't get what you talking about. Just go! Well, I don't have much fucking time. Talk to me ASAP. That would be the last loyalty toward Mr. Park. Do not talk about Big brothers any more. I need to get in right now! Don't waste my fucking time. Find every single data connecting with the mob, Do-kang. See if there are any information in papers, magazines, articles. Any violation, offences must be selected and root out! Don't even think about going back to home until we get him! All of you! Haven't seen him for a day. Well... if you talk about detective Jang. He disobeyed my orders and had no rules. I really care about the rules and regulations, you know... - I sent him. - Sorry? I really sent him a business trip. Any problems? Now I got it. Well, Let's get started. Search! What happened to my adorable girl? Who did that? Daddy. Daddy? Did he do something to you? Daddy. Don't cry, my sweet girl. Who could've imaged you were here? We've been looking for you. You made a promise. What do I know? They give orders. And I follow them. Leave my family alone. As long as you're gone, they'll be fine. That bastard! BAE Kwang-chun. Did you stab him with that knife? Whack him! You can't die on me. You can't. I have to work hard to make up for the 3-year-long break you gave me. Time does fly. My daughter goes to middle school. You don't have kids, do you? Let's cut the chitchat. Get to the point. You got something for me? What is it? They say power lies in the truth. This will help you. I know you gave an order to kill PARK. Do yourself a favor and rest well at home. You don't have much time left out here. You haven't changed a bit. You still don't know how the world works. No. It's you who hasn't changed. You do a lot of social work. But you're still a gangster. Aren't you? Jin-woo, if you keep pushing, you'll get hurt. You know I have the power. You should be... ...pretty damn powerful... ...to stop me. You don't give up, do you? Sure, let's do it. When my wife was pregnant with her... ...CHO told me to whack our boss with BAE. I had to choose between her and our boss. Surprisingly, I didn't hesitate much. So I took him to a deer farm. He wasn't suspicious. He liked drinking blood from live deer. I betrayed our boss... ...and gave up on one ankle for my daughter. Will you protect her? Disapproval investigation? Did I say disapproval investigation? Just send me those files. Who did that? Where exactly did you get ordered? Outside of the government? Yes? Hey, Prosecutor Oh! I can't take the order until I get that words. They are untouchable! If you did something alone, you will be crushed again. Just try to relax, and get some fresh air. Nothing says that investigate slowly, untightly. Can you get him with these information? I'm talking about your job and ambition. President You? Nothing special. Did he say something about the time we get out? He said just stay low until the case Mr. Yang has been cleaned. Find the Mr. Kim or Mr. Assholes! Yes, sir! Seems like victims had been injured... Just little fight. A bunch of mobs were armed and damaged... Did you identify yourself? I know, I know about the rules and laws. But look at the crime scenes! It takes my life to get criminals for 24hours, 7days. They are heavily armed and aggressive. What can we more to say? So will you stab every single one of them? Carrying knives and bats? You want to be a mob member to get mob? They have just knives and bats, but the only arm we get is law. Without law, we become one of them. Well, I don't believe the law of the Republic of Korea. Mr. Jo and Mr. You don't give a fuck about the law, alright? If you are disobedience get out of my team. So before PARK got killed, he and CHO clashed... ...over Segi Shopping Mall. Is that right? Our boss wanted the proceeds to strengthen the Family. But CHO was against it. - He thought it was too risky. - Risky? We weren't the only Family after that shopping mall project. It says here... Ilyang Development won the project. It was run by the Guryong Family. The company's president is related to YOO. I know that for a fact. What is politics? It's making an effort to make people happy and satisfied. If I give it my heart and try hard, they'll see how determined I am. Have you decided on the party and constituency? That's still pending. It's premature to tell you yet. I might go independent if I have to. What? You're taking my constituency? Is this how you repay me? I got you into the circle. How dare you! I've returned your favors enough. I even let you get away with pocketing half of the political funds I donated. Watch it, pal. I've tasted all the bitter sweets in politics. A thug can't bring me down. What'd you just say? Go back to the damn alley where you belong! Politics isn't for everybody. Let alone thugs like you. Know your damn place. - Look, asshole. - How dare you... What's the different between turf and constituency? If I'm a thug, you're a worm. Worms like you are the ones who have fucked up the nation. Your constituency is mine. Don't show up again. Unless you'd like to lie down in a coffin! The company wasn't doing well when it took the project. What's its bank? It's Prime Bank, Yeoksam branch. Two loans, 6 and 9 million each. Someone must've pulled strings to grant those loans. - Get a search warrant issued. - Yes, sir. They're pros. They must've tampered with the books. - The list of shop buyers? - Yes. Here. Get the dossiers on buyers whether individuals or corporations. Ask IRS on ownership changes if there's been any. What's this? Aren't we gonna nail CHO? Those pieces of paper won't bring him to us. We're wasting time! We should get out there and track down that asshole! Come on. This is how things are done around here. We don't just go out there and start sniffing like detectives do. - Okay? - God damn it! What'd you say? That asshole always puts me down. He isn't cut out to be here. Don't. Not sleeping? Mom likes that song. Leave it on. You've lost weight. You shouldn't skip meals. The last thing I want is you getting sick. You should get married soon. It's your mom's wish. Marriage my ass. That's beyond my fate. Be nice to her while she's alive. Once she's gone you'll regret it. Like I do. What? This is good. And... Thanks. We have a search warrant. Do you admit taking illegal political funds? How about pulling strings for a syndicate? How close are you to Mr. YOO? You'll learn the truth soon. You bought a shop at Segi Mall in your son's name 3 years ago. And you sold it later for a large capital gain. Korea is a capitalistic nation. You invest to make money. Don't you? Who gave you the investment tip? - Wasn't it Mr. YOO? - Well... That's your job to find out. Your party dumped you for YOO, right? You're going independent, but chances of winning are very slim. So? What would the result be... ...if YOO's reputation is greatly tainted? You'd make a better politician than I am. Let's see. What is it that I can do for you? Okay then. Let's start over. Mr. HWANG? It's me, YOO Kang-jin. It was a triple bogey. - Everybody knows you're good. - I don't think so. Prosecutor OH! He's the one in charge. Meet Mr. HWANG, a lawyer. He's my senior from school. We'll have dinner soon. Sure. Baekho? Hukgom? Baekho? What do you mean he took the morning flight? I was supposed to meet him for further testimony. To America? Where in America? What? You're his secretary. How can you not know? Hello? Hello? Fuck! The president of Ilyang Development has been released, too. Jin-woo, we need to talk. Not now. We finally got them. And they walk? All of them? There isn't enough evidence. He couldn't help it. It was an order from the chief prosecutor. Fuck him! He's the prosecutor in charge! We've been rummaging through heaps of documents. What more do we need? If we need evidence, plant it! If we need their testimony, beat them! Where's justice? Is this what you brought me to your team for? Is that it? Detective JANG. Stop it! Tell me! You asshole! Talk to me! Tell me! You son of bitch! Say something! Let me go! Shit! I'm doing you a favor! Let go! I'll nail them all! - Cool it! - Fuck it. I'll nail them. I'll leave the fucking force! Shut the fuck up! It's not over yet. We'll get them. I will! Carry an umbrella when it rains. You will catch a cold. Let me tell you one thing. I know that you had PARK killed over the shopping mall. And that you have CHO hiding who killed PARK and Dong-jik. You've been lucky. But your luck will end soon. I'll end it. You must consider yourself just and righteous. You know what justice is? It's winning. You have to be strong to win. The weak get impatient, wired, and lose. - This isn't much like you. - Think again. I'll bet everything. YOO Kang-jin, you... You're going down. Don't bet everything. - Or you'll lose it all. - It's you who will lose. Everything you've earned... I'll make you lose it all. Whatever it takes! He's gone soft. Not the man I knew. You like jazz? No fucking way. - Martini, please. - Sure. That chick. She's CHO's squeeze. How'd you find out? Everybody knows she's a junkie. CHO provided her with drugs and even got her a gig. I have connections, too. What'd I say? I'm just surprised that you took a highway option. Get a new lighter. I never pay for lighters and umbrellas. You buy lotto. That's the only way to fix my pathetic life. You like lotto, too. YOO is your lotto, isn't he? You get him, and that'll be the biggest jackpot in your life. My father was a farmer when I was little. I sometimes I had to skip school and pull out weeds on the rice fields. If you don't, weeds absorb all the nutrients... ...needed for rice plants. It was a never-ending job. So I complained to my father. What's the point? ' And here's what he said. One more weed gone, one more grain of rice for us.' YOO isn't my lotto, but a weed on the rice field. He steals what belongs to others who work so hard. Pulling out weeds like him... That's my job. Don't tell me things like that. I'm on the verge of laughing at you. They're toll receipts. Check out the dates. She's been visiting him every 3 days since he went under. They're CHO's boys. Let's go. Stay here. We'll call for backup. There's no time. Let's get them now. We can't take the risk. She's in critical condition. I don't know. They're moving her to ICU. Get here... Hello? Do-young? JANG Do-young! Soon-ja? Soon-ja! Damn it! What? What's wrong? It's my mom. God damn it! Put your belt on. Son of a bitch! Stop there! Stop! You son of a bitch! Halt! Let him go! Now! Let him go, asshole! Stop it. Stop it now! I... I was dead for worrying. Felt like dying Mrs. Kim. What am I gonna do? I haven't done anything for you. Don't even think about it. I'll be dead too! GO, GO! They're moving her back to the ward. You'll stay to see her, right? If she sees me like this, she won't be happy. You should've been more careful. Hold still. Will Mom be happy? No, she won't. Seeing you like this... If I tell her I'm marrying you? What? She adores you like her own. I bet she'll be happy. Are you proposing to me? Neither of us has any relatives. We'll do a simple wedding. The earlier, the better. Look, Do-young. Are you stupid? You thought I'd jump at it? What do I need to do? Are you asking me to marry you because you love me? I don't know love. What I know is that I feel comfortable with you. And I think it'd be nice to live with you. Isn't that what a marriage is about? I just wanna be happy. Doing what others do. Just one day in my life. I told you to take a rest. I'm fine. - How's your mom? - She'll live. Why don't you go home? Before your wife runs off. I quit when I got married. My wife hated me smoking. Without you, we wouldn't have gotten this far. Thank you. Come on, you're giving me goose bumps. PARK trusted YOO as a friend even after they split. But YOO was ruthless. PARK almost begged him for that shopping mall project. But he ignored him. So PARK ratted on him. - What do you mean? - It was you, wasn't it? You indicted YOO 3 years ago for tax evasion. - That anonymous tip was... - Right. YOO found out while he was in the can. So YOO told me... ...to whack him if I wanted to take over the Family. Damn. Doing PARK was a better option than going against YOO. What about LEE Dong-jik? Who? and YOO. You had him whacked! Don't know LEE Dong-jik? Oh, that kid. That punk went to YOO after he got out of the joint. He blackmailed him for 100 Gs in return for the note. Man, that stupid asshole had some balls. A note? What note? An order to whack PARK. Dig out some dirt on him. He's on the APB list. Don't keep him too close. I think CHO started talking. I told you he wasn't trustworthy. We should've erased him then. Are you giving me a lecture? Don't worry. I'll take care of him. Leave it to me and focus on the election. We're from the Prosecutor's Office. Please, cooperate. What's it regarding? You're under arrest for the murder of PARK. You have the right to remain silent... ...lf you need an attorney, one will be appointed to you. Prosecutor OH Jin-woo... ...arrested Mr. YOO Kang-jin this afternoon... ...for murder and organizing a crime ring. The Democratic People's Party is claming that... ...this is nothing but a political act to influence the election. You need more than depositions to indict him. You don't have a case. Let's call it a day. By the way... You haven't found the note Dong-jik had, have you? What if we get hold of that note before you do? What I need is evidence. You took care of the books for the shopping mall. I bet you still have them. If I was to back down... I wouldn't have thought to go abroad. Is that so? We learned that... ...a large amount of money has been wired into an off-shore account. It's too much for YOO to let slide, even if you're friends. And you tried to run off while he was in police custody. Give it some thought. You help me, and I'll let you walk. You think you can indict him if I help you? I don't think you know him well. Mr. JU. Say, you refuse to help me, will YOO believe you? Get the picture? Mr. CHO. You need to do something for us. Can I make a phone call afterwards? - To call home? - Yeah, I'm worried. Outgoing calls are forbidden at this hour. This won't do you any good. You know there's a shortcut. Why don't you take it? Mr. OH. Did you read that book I gave you? There's this famous phrase that says as follows: 'Like a lion that's not scared of a sound.' 'Like the wind that penetrates the net.' 'Like a lotus flower that can't be dirtied.' 'You go on your own.' As if you neither want nor trust anything. YANG and CHO are ready for cross-examination. - Bring them. - Okay. Detective JANG. We've met before, right? On the day your brother got released. Remember? I heard that he'd died. I'm sorry. Young and green... He was a good kid. You killed him, didn't you? You gave the order. Talk, motherfucker! What's he talking about? - What's going on? - Oh! You didn't know, did you? Is it true? He was your brother? - Answer me. Is that true? - Yes! He was my half brother! Okay? I was gonna tell you. I really was. Fuck. Is that why you were so eager to catch him? To seek revenge? You told me weeds should be pulled out. We put them away for what they did, and that's it! Fire me, or send me to jail. If that's what it takes to bust those who killed my brother... - I don't fucking care! - Shut the fuck up! I can't keep you on the team. Go back to your department. - Jin-woo! - Don't you get it? We could be a laughingstock! I can't jeopardize the case... ...over your personal revenge. I didn't mean to lie to you. You should've told me in the beginning. Everything... You would've chosen me anyway. God damn it! What happened? What happened?! I did lock it from outside. Where's CHO? - Find him. Go! - Yes, sir, hurry! Place an APB out on him. The suspect has run. How should I know?! - Jin-woo! - Place... CHO has turned himself in. What? Who's Detective JANG? From the Internal Affairs. Prosecutor OH Jin-woo? Detective JANG? You're under arrest... ...for assault and involuntary manslaughter. Move! Get the fuck off me! Back off! Stop! They're doing their job. Don't cause trouble. Jin-woo! What the fuck! Get off me! You don't know shit! CHO, a murder suspect, is claming he and Yang tried... ... to escape due to severe torture by the investigator. YANG jumped from the 11th floor and died on the spot. Internal Affairs arrested Prosecutor OH Jin-woo... ... and Detective JANG Do-young who interrogated the suspects. A thorough investigation will follow to get to the bottom of the case. It's said that there are signs of beatings on their bodies. Is it true? Yes. And the prosecutor and detective are denying the allegations? What will happen to Mr. YOO? He'll be released due to insufficient evidence. I told you not to bet everything. Son of a bitch! You did it. You set us up! I'll kill you, asshole! Get back here! I'll kill you right now! Come back here! Stop right there! I'll kill you! You're as good as dead! Come here! Get back here! Come here, motherfucker! Come back here! I'll kill you! You've done a lot for me. Money? I wouldn't have cared if you had taken it all. You're my friend and family. Why'd you do it? I don't care what they say. I wanna hear it from you. Why'd you do it? For my own sake. How do I know I won't end up like PARK? PARK? - I trusted you. - You didn't. You don't trust anybody but yourself. You don't desert a family first? All you have is those who you've killed and those to kill. Friends are no exception. PARK would've never imagined that his friend... Shut the fuck up! Okay. Let me ask you this. If I give you another chance, will you be loyal? Not anymore, sir. The bodies of CHO and YANG were bruised all over... ...which signifies how severely they were beaten... ...during the interrogation. You either ignored or ordered beatings, didn't you? I punched and kicked them a few times... ...to keep them from resisting. But there was no intended torture to make them confess. On the day of the accident... ...Defendant JANG cross-examined you and JANG, correct? Yes. He assaulted you and YANG for not confessing. Is that true? It is. Stop lying, asshole! - Defendant! - Tell the truth! Tell them YOO set it up! Defendant, quiet! - Sit. - Jin-woo... Sit down! When you were working homicide... ...you assaulted the suspect to the point of hospitalization? Yes. Did Defendant OH Jin-woo give you an order to use violence? - That's nonsense. - Yes or no! No. He suggested the use of violence, didn't he? No! I sometimes lost my cool and beat suspects. Yes, I admit that. But that had nothing to do with OH Jin-woo. You gotta believe me. Stop believing a thug's story. Believe mine! Did you know he was on suspension when you put him on your team? I did. So you knew he was violent. Correct? To investigate criminal rings, daring investigators are needed. Ones that can't be bought. In that aspect, I judged that Detective JANG was right for the job. He was right for the job? He and the murder victim named LEE Dong-jik... Did you know they were half brothers? I learned that later. As the prosecutor in charge, you didn't predict... ...what damage his personal revenge could do to the investigation? Like I said, I learned that much later. When I did, I ordered him back to his department. That was too late. It was after the suspect died! The personal revenge of JANG, to catch his brother's killer... ...led to the death of the suspect. And the prosecutor in charge ignored the risk involved... ...which provided cause for infringement upon human rights. That's not true! You will have a chance to defend yourself. I never worked against the law even for a just cause. That was my principle. - That was my will. - Defendant! But... Now I'm charged with... ...what contradicts my principle. In the courtroom... ...where only what gangsters say is believed to be true! This is no trial. This is nothing but a witch hunt! Order! Defendant, I can hold you in contempt of court! This courtroom has already been contaminated! You're looking for scapegoats. Where's dignity and authority? When we were investigating a cold murder case... You couldn't care less. Don't tell me about the law and principles now! Shut up! You're only a criminal! You beat up the innocent! Adjourned! What happened to justice? Even thugs look after each other! - Why... - Jin-woo! Why are you deserting me? Why?! Open your eyes! You don't know the truth and won't try to see it! You have no right to try me! Try to see the truth! Try to see the truth! You all know who is behind! Jin-woo. What have we done wrong? What can we do now? To catch CHO... ...I turned over the case files to junkies. I wanted YOO that badly. But the truth was... I was already losing. No way. You can't lose. The trial? I don't care if I rot in jail. Tell them I did it. Put it all on me. You get out of here. You can't be in here. Get out of here and nail that son of a bitch. It's over. Don't fucking say that! You can't give up! Didn't you tell me? You said that weeds should be pulled out! I can't give up now. I just can't. I can't! Do-young. I'm sorry I got you into this mess. Fuck. Know what? My life is one big mess. It's not here! Damn it! Soon-ja! Wake up, Soon-ja! Soon-ja, wake up! Soon-ja! Soon-ja... Why... Why... Why! I used that picture until I got her portrait made. The picture frame broke, and it was in the back of it. I don't know if I should be telling you this now. A group of strangers came by right before she died. Sign here, please. Do me a favor. Take it to that person. And take care of my mom once and for all. What's wrong? What are you thinking? Do-young? Do-young! - Really? - Of course, tell Daddy. Go downstairs! Hurry up! Get down! - Min! - Get in the car! Start the car! Start the car! Drop your weapon and surrender. Don't force us to take you out. You're surrounded. This is the last warning. Do-young, it's me. This doesn't solve anything! Go ahead. Come on, kid. Go ahead! It's been a while. You got something for me? Everybody died over this. Over this piece of paper... You think you beat me, don't you? Right? I got it all, and you lost everything. I'm the winner. Got it? You can't understand... It'll be a cold day in the fucking hell before you know! You can't follow me.
