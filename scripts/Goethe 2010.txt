" Do you know the exact wording of the Augustinian Principle? Of course. Yes? What is it? The wording? The principles of common law are not only categorical but also... Is nut, much rather Augustine himself a... principle of me, you, us? A principle of us. Doesn't the assumption that it is more of a principle than of actual existence make his principle and its exact wording irrelevant? At least in principle. Maybe it's both or reversed or... or... The young man is boldly crazy. Boldly crazy? Nut at all! Boldly crazy is a child who kills his mother and father and calls for mercy because he's now orphaned. That is crazy... and bold. Failed. You should have opened a book now and then. Namely a textbook. - Nut this nonsense by Lessing, Shakeslear or whatever those scribblers are called. And best regards to your father! Our dear Goethe, spelled "oe. " Cold without a doctoral cap? We should write a few lines to Goethe senior. KISS MY ASS! Guetz, colon. Give me some water to drink. " Freedom. Guetz vun Berlichingen. " It is dune. Shit! What's this? Get off! - Express mail. It has to be in Leipzig tomorrow. I see. - It's the original. There's no copy. I trust you. Seems quite important. - Important? My life is at stake! YOUNG GOETHE IN LOVE The nymph hurries off into the forest's delight. The lark soars and whirs. Calls. The silky green shimmers in boundless glory... Johann, you old scoundrel. - What are you doing at this horrid reading? I was about to ask you the same. - Everything but listening. Beauty fosters sweet hurt... - I bet he rhymes it with "heart. " and breaks my golden heart. Such grandiloquence! - Even worse: People like it Where is true art? - Mine has been sent off. - Really? Out of your brain, onto the page? - In the mail... Off and away. - Goetz con Berlichingen dune and sent? I dare bet it'll be published in no time. - To true art! The wildest thoughts! Passionate. Abysmal. And forbidden. Against reason. -Against rationality. - Against the rules. To passion. - To "Sturm"... - and drink! TWO WEEKS LATER Child's play! All of it is child's play! King of Thule! Erl King! How old are you? Let me be, Father. - I let you belong enough. "Filling wood and vale you cast Quiet misty sheen And for once release at last All my soul serene. " What is this nonsense about? It is addressed to the moon. To the moon? Are you a woman or a man? Just so you know, I refuse to finance this ridiculous scribbling and rhyming any longer. The highest order of reasoning is... - If I do as you say. Exactly! Exactly. I wrote Kammermeier, who is President of the Supreme Court of Justice. They'd offer you an apprenticeship. - In Wetzlar, that godforsaken backwater? Never! - It wasn't meant as a question. Am I interrupting? This just arrived for you from Leipzig. Well, here you go, Father. From now on, you may well stop financing me. Because from now on, my ridiculous scribbling will support me just fine. "... Thank you for your manuscript. It is certainly proof of great diligence and effort... we have to inform you that we consider your play to be completely free of all talent... unbelievable characters, bumbling rhymes, a call to take justice into one's own hands. " One of life's lessons is to recognize your abilities and your inabilities. My sun, you will surely become an outstanding lawyer. Why? Excuse me? Why are you here? I'd like to be taught justice justly. And beyond the self-evident? Practice. The license to practice... - Your credentials do not speak of great effort. Denied! He is the spitting image of his father! Kestner, accommodate this young man. If I understood Goethe senior correctly, his sun is a bit of a silly fellow, writing poems and such. We are to cure him. - As you wish, Mr. President. Shouldn't these be put away? - These are pending cases, Sir Scholar. I see. -All employees are subject to a dress code and rank. That'll do. No lady visitors. Do you fence? Not really. Room and board are provided by the court. Family disputes of the years '47 to '51: Catalogue, categorize, and submit them to the court. Sir Scholar, your desk. Did you drop something again? Wilhelm Jerusalem. Johann Goethe. My pleasure. D- d-do you dance? This is awful. Wetzlar isn't Strasbourg, you know. Funerals are more fun. G- g-gentlemen... Shit! - I am sorry, Sir. Oh, God... Yes, it's alright. - Oh, God. It suits you well, though. - What? Red. Lawyer. - Why? - No sense of humor. Hold on! And you are? Tipsy. - And unbridled. And not interested. Lucky for me. Would you care to dance? Nut interested. Lucky for me. Bl-Bumpkin! I wish she had run into me. - Yes, then my jacket would be clean. Quiet! - I am quiet. Want to join me for a nightcap? But only one. Good morning, gentlemen. Morning. The documents requested by our magnanimous master. Thank you. - The pleasure is all ours. Unworthy as we are - Yes. - Yes - Yes. Thank you. - Much obliged. - Much obliged. I wish to have all of this processed within the next 48 hours. If nut, your employment here is terminated immediately. Do you hear that? Damn beautiful. A small break? That's your b-bumpkin. Will you come to rehearsal tomorrow? - I can't. I have to bake and wash. And your maid? - She left. - What? We couldn't afford her. Ladies! Have we met? - At the dance. I almost didn't recognize you, without the stain. Same here, without the tipsiness. You are impertinent. - You are unbridled, boisterous, and supremely... Well, wouldn't this be the moment to introduce yourself. I am Johann Goethe. "lav I? Saddle up and move! Right now! What's this? - Unforeseen events force me I am Lotte, Lotte Buff from Wahlheim! Lottie! You will certainly remember our dear Counselor of Justice, Kestner. Well, certainly. - I have to praise you. Miss Buff, you sang marvelously, truly marvelously. You look so inspired. Probably the effect of church. Could I possibly pay you a visit for afternoon tea next Sunday, or perhaps a little walk, if you please? You are more than welcome, Mr. Kestner. The Counselor seems to have taken a liking to you. - You think? You'll surely like him too. - He seems decent. A capable man, and wealthy too. I wouldn't have thought you capable of this. And you, even less. The Court assumes you have learned your lesson and will abstain from any future excesses. The gentlemen are dismissed for the rest of the day. We should go for a ride. - Later. Now. - Must we? Yes, we must. Come! You can't go like that. It's all I have. - Hold on. Gentlemen. - Goethe, quite a daring outfit. Complementary colors. - How about green-red or pink-ochre. Or orange-lilac? You scoundrel! You bastard-fart! In a quiet midday slumber, mother earth is resting in her lair. The sun god banishes all anguish with its golden hair. " Who wrote that? Nobody. It just... popped into my head. A pom I once thought so. But? Nobody else did. Particularly not my father. We could make a short detour. - To this village? To Wahlheim. Wait! How do I look? Irresistible. What do you want? Aren't you the Buff family? - Maybe. We have nothing to give. Anna, there are two beggars at the dour. We are looking for the lady who sang so beautifully last Sunday. - At the church. Lotte-Popotte, visitors! For me? The honorable Mr. Goethe. And Mr...? Wilhelm Jerusalem. You look very... blue-yellow, Mr. Goethe. It's the latest craze. Yes. In Paris. So which ones are actually yours? - All of them! They're all my siblings. Of course. - We're right in the middle of baking bread. As chance would have it, he's an extraordinary baker's helper. Careful, it's hut! Snatched up! - I want the biggest. I want a piece. Who will be first out to the yard? Mr. Goethe, would you like some too? - Yes, please. Hmm, tasty. With thyme. Good palate. Our dear late mother always baked it like that. I try to make it like she did, for them - How long has she been... - A year. Good. I lost once again. - It seems you like losing. - I'll start. I'll start over again. What... 7 - That was mean! Bona nox, you are a real ox. Buona notte, dear Lotte! Bonne nuit, fie, fie! It'll be a long way home. Good night! Hit the sack, make it crack! Sleep safe and sound. Twist your ass to your mouth all around! Sing a round! Miss Buff, with that voice you should perform onstage. How true! - Father would never let her. Just like Johann's father. - Why? He would have liked to become a poet. And his father wouldn't allow it? - Yes, and rightly so. What did you write? Well, poems that nobody wanted to read. And a play that nobody wanted to print. - I love plays. I read Emilia Galotti three times. - And cried each time. What I wouldn't do to see that play onstage just once. Be very still now. Would you mind reciting something? I would like to hear that too. Perhaps some other time. It is very late too. Mr. Jerusalem, honorable Mr. Goethe, It was a great pleasure to have you here. Sleep well. How could you possibly have let yourself be tempted to engage in such grave misconduct? Even the challenge makes one liable to prosecution. We are not here to judge your opponent's death, but your tempting him to engage in an illegal duel. Thank you. - I demand two years in prison. Granted. The verdict takes immediate effect. Please proceed with preparations for the next case. Are the papers for the Schwerdtlein case ready, Goethe? Yes, of course. When, if you please, did you write this list? Just before the hearing began. Very fast. Sir Scholar, you are very fast and fired up today. Solely your outer appearance leaves something to be desired Please, Mr. Counselor. Why don't you write her first? If I write her first, I deprive her of the opportunity to write to me first. But if Miss Buff thinks the same, hence not writing you first, so as not to deprive you of the opportunity to write her first, then... - All love is lust. Miss Buff, please wait! Please wait! Miss Buff... oh! Sir? I mistook you for someone else. I'm sorry. Well then, have a good day, gentlemen. My fair young lady, may I be so daring as to lend you my arm and companion? I'm not a lady. But fair! - Yes. Or would you rather go home without his care? Oh, God! I'm sorry. If you go on like this, we'll eat off the?our. - Yes, you're right. Quite charming, that Mr. Goethe, don't you think? Plays the clavichord, likes baking bread. Quite entertaining for a lawyer. I'm expecting an important letter. - Your name would help. Goethe, spelled with an "oe. " - Goethe... No, I'm sorry. You sure? - Quite sure. Did a letter arrive for me? - No. For the third time, nu! You sure? - I'm sure. No. I only wanted... - No! No, nu, nu. There was no one but her and me. You should have seen how she smiled at me, the entire time. And then she suddenly had to leave. And why? She didn't say. Mr. Goethe, something did arrive for you after all. - What did I tell you? Thank you very much. - My pleasure. From my Papa Want to know what I think? - No. Alright. I have to go to town. - What? We don't have enough sugar. - But there is at least another pound... - That will never be enough! Is your sister home? Which one? Mr. Goethe? She went to Wetzlar. What a surprise. What are you doing here? - I just wanted to visit Mr. Goethe. But he's visiting you. Mr. Goethe! What a coincidence. Crazy! - Where are you going? I went to the market. And you, my dear Werther? Your dear Werther is riding around, admiring the scenery and just riding around. Well? What? Will you recite something for me today? Perhaps another time? You won't get away with that today. - It's kid's stuff, all of it. I beg you. - It is ridiculous scribbling and rhyming. You are just a coward. Discreet. Cautious. Humble. Very well, I will not breathe again until you've recited something. That is boldly crazy. And absurd too, Miss Buff. I'm impressed and you will give up in no time, I know. Yes, well... Miss Buff! What are you doing? Alright then... - No, please, nu! Stop it! Alright, you win. Quick beat my heart: to horse! Haste, haste, And lo! 'twas done with speed of light; The evening soon the world embraced, And o'er the mountains hung the night. I saw thee, and with tender pride Felt thy sweet gaze pour joy on me; While all my heart was at thy side. And every breath I breathed for thee. Ridiculous. It is truly ridiculous... that you don't believe in yourself. Tell me... wouldn't this be the moment? Which moment? The one where you kiss me. I am so hungry! - Father is almost dune. I want to eat now! I don't want soup. - You'll have soup! Anna, why isn't the table set yet? Where have you been? - Went for a walk. I thought you went to buy sugar. That too. She needs to have her diaper changed. - So? Your dress is ruined. - I'll hang it up to dry. Have you ever been in love? - Yes. Shit. How foolish! You are usually so reasonable. Now of all times. Going for a walk in the rain. This kind of reading obviously confuses you. And help her with her hair. Gorgeous lilies. Right, Charlotte? Yes, Father. Lilies are Lotte's favorite?owers. I made a good choice then. A walk, I assume, is currently out of the question, Miss Buff. I'm very sorry, Mr. Counselor. - Surely at a later date. - Sure. Sure. I think... the?owers need water and a vase. For the water. - Of course. - In the kitchen. Come! Are you coming? Here we are, and I'm at a loss for words. Do you know Emilia Galotti? Nut personally. It is a play. By Lessing. I... have heard of it. See you soon. - See you soon. Father says... - I know what Father says. He says, if he marries you, we won't lose the house. And the buys can go to school. Beautiful! What will be performed? - Her favorite play. - Emilia Galotti? She'll be beside herself with joy. Yes, if she can't go to the theater... Please pull. The theater will come to her. And you will play Galotti. I will unfortunately have to decline, Mr. Theater Director. I already have a role in my own drama. With a happy ending, I hope. Yes. She wants to leave her husband for me. - Her husband? Yes. We will run away and live happily ever after. I know it. Ah! Goethe, back on your feet. - Yes, quicker than I thought. The Ravensburg files will arrive shortly. Get started on them right away. Oh, Goethe, do you hunt? I'm not a great marksman. - We'll change that. Did I hit it? - Almost. You shouldn't hesitate. That's of utmost importance when hunting. As soon as you see the target, shoulder your gun, aim, shout. Bang. Dead. You have to be dispassionate, cold-blooded. That's all. I'll try it next time. You are much too sensitive. Chest hit. Nut bad. - I fought in '61. That's how you learn to shout. It'll make a good stew. - Do you cook? No, I will leave that to my future wife. Really? You are engaged? - Everything's been arranged with her father. I merely have to propose to her and get that over with. What's stopping you? - I fear I won't find the right words. Unfortunately, the young lady is interested in literature. Oh, well then... You'll have to win her over with style and passion! - Easier said than dune. Well, perhaps... You enter her room and ask her to close her eyes. And then? - You slip a ring on her finger. She opens her eyes, sees the ring, and then... you'll say something like... "It is love, that holds the world together at its cure. " That's good. That is very good. - But with passion! I should send you instead. Courage is all you need! A visitor! Mr. Counselor, what a surprise. You look much better, Miss Buff. Yes, the doctor you so kindly sent over was of great help. He's a fine fellow and an old acquaintance from the military. Would you ask him not to request his payment until next month. But I insist on paying for it. I don't know how to thank you, Mr. Counselor. Your actions are so very generous I'll make us some tea. - Wait! The Counselor would like to tell you something. Sit down, Lotte. Close your eyes. You can open your eyes again. Miss Buff? I don't know what to say. I am delighted as well. Children, come in. There is... There is great news! Come in! Miss Buff... Be quiet now! - Charlotte... It is love that holds the world together at its cure. That was well put. Ma! I hope? Yes, Mr. Kestner. You may. Thank you. My dear Werther! Circumstances demanded engaged today. I kindly ask you to refrain from any further visits. My heart is so heavy. Mr. Goethe, please come into my office immediately. Your Charlotte Buff. Goethe? Thank you. Did she accept? - And she was overjoyed. For me, and I'm sure for her too, it was probably... the greatest moment of our lives. - I'm happy, truly happy, Mr. Kestner. Albert. Now more than ever. - Johann. We're getting together tonight to celebrate the happy news. I would be delighted... - I'd like to, but... But you have to meet her! - Yes, some other time. Tonight, I have my own romantic duty. - No! Yes. So, is she still under siege or did you conquer her walls already? The walls have tumbled. Well, then you are naturally excused. Counselor. Mr. Goethe! When I saw Charlotte again, the little girl from long ago had turned into a delicate and respectable young woman. So it is with great pleasure that I announce to Lotte's family and of course to my dear colleagues my, nu, our successful... our successful engagement today. Miss Buff! - Mr. Goethe! I do hope I'm not intruding, but I've brought a little surprise for you. Haven't you received my letter? - What letter? Lotte! - There you are! Yes. I'll be right there. - Who is it? Father, this is Johann Goethe. From the court. A late guest! My favorite kind. Charlotte, some port for Mr. Goethe, the good stuff. You do like port? Yes, please. Johann? I'm so happy you made it! A must wonderful surprise. I thought you had your own romantic duty. May I introduce my charming fiancee? Charlotte Buff. Johann Goethe, my best man at the court, and my friend. Well, pleased to meet you. Indeed, pleased to meet you. Congratulations. Thank you. - So, let's drink to the engagement of Charlotte and Albert. Might that be a gift, Johann? Yes. A paper theater. Emilia Galotti. Did you hear that, Lotte? Isn't that the play you like so much? Mr. Goethe! Will you play something on the clavichord again? Please! -Another time. I don't think Mr. Goethe will be visiting very often any more. Weren't you about to take your leave? Yes. Yes, I was. Miss Buff. Mr. Buff. Counselor of Law. Charlotte, don't you have anything to say to the Counselor of Law? It was... It was before our engagement. You will not see Mr. Goethe again. Of course nut. In that case I will take my leave. Mr. Goethe! Another letter has arrived for you. I know. My child? What's it about anyway? Emilia is taken by a rich man although she loves someone else. In her desperation she asks her father to take her life. That's awful. Yes. A wholly botched life. Albert is a real blessing for you and for our whole family. God only knows how long I can go on working, Lotte. I would just like to see you all provided fur. But my heart is not in it. You'll get over that in time. Believe me. It's over. - She has rejected him. Surprise, surprise. She chose her husband after all. She didn't want to?ee with him and live happily ever after. It's been known to happen. Other daughters have pretty mothers too. Tonight we will go to the fair where we will drown your sorrows in our drinks. Want one too? Magic drops. Jerusalem, what was that? - Belladonna! Belladonna! - Never had anything better! Ever seen so many beautiful women? Never! Spit at love three times! And I will give you eternal youth. Away, evil spirit! I am my own hell. Johann! What do you think of her? I think it's serious. You know what? I love you. This Goethe... She can't forget him. He's making a mockery of me. What are you doing here? I'm leaving. Will you accompany me? Leaving? At this hour? Come with me. Where to? Simply away from here. Into the other world. Where no s-sorrow torments us. What? What are you talking about? I can't live without her. - What? See you soon, my friend. Entry wound at the right eye. Exit wound at the back of the head on the right. Remained conscious. Three hours of death-struggle. Then death. Time of the incident? The time of the incident? In the morning. It was already light. Eight o'clock. Diagnosis: Morbus melancholicus, leading to self-murder. Suicide. Please write "suicide. " Don't you know what time it is? Don't you know what's happened? Certainly. This incident caused me considerable trouble too. May I introduce your new colleague? The excellent assessor will fill the void that the genteel Mr. Jerusalem left in our ranks by his... Never speak ill of the dead. If one commits such an ungodly act, one should expect to be spoken ill of, don't you think? Your very words are ungodly. Your effeminate grief is ridiculous. Somebody fetch a jug for the tears of the young gentleman. - Hold your tongue, scoundrel! - Please. Please. Such coarse language from the mouth of an unsung poet. Yet my bride was enthralled by his sweet words: "It is love that holds the world together at its cure. " Isn't that beautiful? I demand satisfaction. Take ten steps. You have three shots each. Mr. Goethe, the first shot is yours by right. You are under arrest for illegal dueling. A gross breach of conduct! You should be grateful Kestner was prudent enough not to enter into the duel. We will try to schedule your trial at the earliest possible date. Until that time you will be kept under arrest here at the court. For the feast I was thinking of hare, with a good red wine. Goethe sends his regards, by the way. Excuse me? He's sorry he couldn't say goodbye before his departure. So, he has departed? It came as a surprise to me too. Thank you, my love. Your meal! - I'm coming. Here, you need to eat something. Women grow on trees. I have... I have a request to make of you. I'd like some paper. And ink. And thus Johann saw before him... And thus dear Werther saw before him the most charming spectacle he had ever witnessed. He stood there in his blue and yellow attire. Children were running about... she cut a dark bread... beautiful appearance... according to their ages... small hands held high... with such kindness. Each of them was so unaffected... Is that impudence? Or genuine emotional expression? I don't know the man I feared in Lotte's heart... white dress... heart... feelings... grand soul... It suits you well though. - What? Red. Would you care to dance? Not interested. - Lucky for me. With her, couldn't I express all those feelings that nature instilled in my heart... Such kindness paired with such firmness. The soul's tranquility when engaged in life and work. Tasty. With thyme. Good palate. - Distance and future are much the same. My heart was entirely at your side and every breath was for you. Giving our all... Which moment? - The one where you kiss me. My heart was full... memories of things past overcame me and tears welled up in my eyes. It opens and closes. This small dial shows the minutes, the big one the hours. I want a watch when I grow up. Do your best at school and I might give you one. Neck size 13. That's perfect. It's a 96. Such wonderful cloth. - Finest batiste. From Venice. Albert is really trying to make you happy. THE SORROWS OF YOUNG WERTHER I'll get it. An arm length of 70. You will look like a princess. This came from the court. Lotte, the tailors are waiting. - Nut now. "So now all desires and all hopes have been fulfilled. That he had been blessed with the good fortune to die for her. " You... You lied to me. It was... It was best. For us. I must go to him. Certainly. Finally! Why are you doing this to me? What? - Do you really think I could ever be happy again, if you were to harm yourself? But without you, dear Werther cannot live. Does Werther want to stay in the countryside and get his degree? And provide for Lotte's entire family? And keep working his way up until he is president of the court? Is that what he wants? That is not Werther's life. It's Albert's. And Lotte's. So she truly loves Albert? Yes. I love him. And Werther? He should make something of his talent and not kill himself. Please leave. And still, the two stay together forever. Nut in truth. But in poetry. Yes. Burn it. Very well. You may take me back now. I'm back. SIX MONTHS LATER I wouldn't have thought it possible for him to do something like this. The whole thing is very embarrassing. - The tendency for feelings is a virus that has infected young people everywhere. Reason is on the retreat. Old virtues are fading, Kaspar. He's being detained here. Johann. It was my mistake. I overestimated you. I treated you like a young man, yet you are but a child. Until you come to your senses you will stay in Frankfurt. There you will work in my chambers under strict supervision. Who crammed these crazy ideas into your head? An early death is a pointless life. - Leave it, Father. I am my own hell. Hey, make way! Make Way! Where are we? - Home. But some people are blocking the street. - Out of the way! Make Way! Excuse me, what is going on here? - Haven't you heard? Have you been living under a ruck? - He can't be from here. You assured me. I paid you three days ago. - Please, calm down, gentlemen! I beg of you. Please calm down. The day after tomorrow... The day after tomorrow I will get new copies. The printer has promised me. Maybe as soon as tomorrow. What can I do? I can't print them myself. The people seem to like your scribblings. What is that? And it doesn't even rhyme. THE SORROWS OF YOUNG WERTHER Lotte? Shit! You would've made a wretched lawyer anyway. That's him! It's Johann Goethe! I know him from university. Goethe, with an "oe"! Thank you. Thank you. Get your head out. Our Goethe. - He simply writes the must banal of stories. - Boy loves girl. Girl marries another. - Boy blows his brains out. Here's to passion. - To "Sturm"... -And drink! I think he is expected. Go on! Get out there! That's my sun! My sun. Johann Goethe. It's our story. It would be an honor to publish it. I have one last question. Is this really what happened? Is it all true? It is more than truth. It is poetry. The Sorrows of Young Werther made Werther's story sparked off a youth movement and led to a wave of suicides. Lotte bore Kestner many children. She saw Johann only one more time.
