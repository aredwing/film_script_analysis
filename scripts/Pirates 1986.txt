Come on down, you little baboon. - You want to eat me. Damn it. - It's a law of nature... by thunder! The strong always eat the weak. Come on down lad... make an effort. - Cannibal! - Come on, piggy-wiggy. I'm not piggy, I'm the Frog. Cannibalism is a mortal sin. It will bring you bad luck! You shall writhe in hellfire. What about confession? What do you think confession's for? Sail ho! Sail ho to windward! Devil take you, Frog, have I not told you to trust me? - Am I not proved right again. - Aye, aye, Cap'n. Well you're not to forget it, you little rascal. Never lose faith in divine providence... never! Watch out, lad! The shark, a shark. 'Twas good sport, though, by thunder, 'twas indeed. You can have me balls for breakfast if 'twasn't, what do you say? Whatever you say, Cap'n. Then we're both agreed. Ah-hoy! A-hoy there! Dang me buttons! There's a thin slice o' luck! See her colors? Spaniard! Quick, quick... The documents, for heaven's sake! Me gold! - Miserable wretch! - God will be your ruin, Cap'n. - It will cost us our heads. - Easier to live without a head than... without gold, you numskull. I fight for hatred or the Spaniard... I fight for glory, not gold! A man fights for what he lacks the most. Shiver me soul! - What, Cap'n Red? - "What, Cap'n Red? What, Cap'n Red?" Can't you see those whore-sons ain't a-changin' course? She'll run straight past us, all sail set and the wind up her tail. Aye, Cap'n... she's holding course. Per-perhaps... 'tis a ghost ship? Ghost or no ghost, we need a- rescuing', by thunder. - Ahoy! - Ahoy there! Ahoy on deck! - Here, Frog! I'm stuck! - Drop the chest, Cap'n! - Drop the chest! - Never! Three. Four. Five. Six. Quick, quick... Pull. Pull, damn it... Help! Help! Here... Me treasure! Murder! Five-and-twenty years of unstintin' toil! All me savings! Down to the brig with them! Come over here, and open your lug-holes. If they should question us remember this: henceforth, I'm Benjamin Parr... - of London, understand? - I understand, Cap'n. Cotton shipper for Matthew Spencer and Company, right? Attacked at night by pirates. On board the... "The Morning Star". Sunk with all hands. We're the sole survivors. Repeat. Benjamin Parr of London, cotton shipper of... Tobacco or vanilla would be better. - And who might you be, sir? - Joseph Seraphin Amadeus Boomako. - Boomako? - Boomako, ship's cook. - What the devil are you doin' down here? - I'm in irons, Captain. - And why's that, pray? - Spaniards loco... they say Boomako poison great Captain Linares to steal throne. - Throne? What throne? - Throne of Kapatek-Anahuac. Kapatek-Anahuac? - Here? - Who? - The throne. - Ah, here. - You've seen it? - Ah, by little hole. - Where, for God's sake? - Here. Put your eye here and you see... If I may make so bold, they'd look very well hanging from the yardarm. Yet you have just informed me that they were victims of a shipwreck. A pair of dogs, Your Honor! An Englishman and a Frenchman! Lieutenant, I would remind you once and for all, that the war is over. - On paper, perhaps. - When a treaty bears... the sign manual of His Most Catholic Majesty... personal sentiments must take second place to national obligations. - You Honor's vinegar purge. - Another! 'Tis the fourth today. I assure you, doctor, I have naught left inside me to be purged of. And Spain's present obligations are clearly defined by the Treaty... - of Pyrenees... - It will get cold, Your Honor. which treaty expresses the will of our noble King Philip the Fou... ourth... A treaty signed by His Excellency Cardinal Mazarin... to the greater glory of our country and the honor of our Holy Mother... the Church. Tut, tut... - we haven't eaten our oatmeal. - Quite possibly. So we need look no further should Your Honor have no movement of the bowels. Now then. You were shipwrecked, I am told. We were indeed, Your Honor, sir, till divine providence saw fit - Deo gratias, to put us in the way of this here vessel belonging to the good King... of Spain. I see. This shipwreck... how did it come about? - Pirates... Devil take 'em! - Who were these pirates? 'Twere too dark to see, sir. I did hear 'em shout a name, though... wait... I think... Ah, I heard "Cap'n Red, what shall we do with 'em?" "Kill 'em all," says he. "There's naught but baccy and vanilla aboard this hulk. " That was our cargo on the "MorningStar", sir, tobacco and vanilla. - You heard "Captain Red", are you sure? - Sure as I've a timber leg, sir. - He has been dead these past four years. - Garcia Gomez put an end to him... at Boca del Toro. This dog must have been dreaming. What ain't no dream, Your Honor, is all I possessed... went down in that there skirmish. Homeward bound, I was... after 18 years a-workin' me fingers to the bone on a little vanilla plantation. Life's always dealt me harsh. Take this cursed leg o' mine; crushed by a barrel of vanilla at the tender age of three-and-twenty. And the scar? On your head... was that a barrel of vanilla too? Not at all, sir, not at all. That's from the irons they used to pluck me from me poor late mother's womb. I 'hope Your Honor gaveno such trouble to his own mother. Some respect, dog! Away with them. Look at it sing, the tasty little titbit! Caramba, I could make you sing a song or two. And you wouldn't need your guitarra, believe me! Are you not, as I have had the pleasure of bein' told, the carpenter? Master Carpenter. And a fine trade it is, by the power! Many's the time I've regretted... not learnin' it myself. Still, too late now, and there's an end on it. I perceived your kindly features at once, master carpenter, and was a... wonderin' whather pr'aps you might wishto devote a little of your precious... - time to me timber leg. - What's amiss with it? Cutt off short in its prime... I drift to starboard every step I take. These are some precious family heirlooms what I've always refused to... be parted from, even in times of direst adversity. Like this one here. 'Twere given me by me favorite aunt. - And the other? - Ah, that one! Me father gave that to me poor old mother, God rest her! Thank you, gentlemen. I think we have settled matters insofar as we are able. Go take some rest and leave me to prepare for my own, which I warrant... this time will be a lasting one... Long live the King! - Long live Spain! - Long live the King! Long live Spain! - I have done all I could, Your Honor. - I know, my good Juanito, I know. Alas, there are times when all is not enough. Farewell, Doctor. My son, unburden your soul to Almighty God. Confess your sins and repent of them is humility... - that they may be forgiven you. - Ah, my sins... How they haunt me! We both know, my son, how Satan con profit from a sailor's isolation... inciting him to shameful solitary practices. - I am an old man, Padre... - Very well, then. There remain greed... anger, pride, mendacity, sloth... Let us wrestle with them one by one. For some time now, I have been plagued by certain weighty questions which... hardly pertain to mendacity or sloth. - What manner of questions? - Throughout my life I gave fought for... my King, my country, and Holy Mother Church. - And God shall reward you for it. - I have killed in their name. - A soldier's duty. - Aye, but 'tis a sorry duty to kill... men, women and childrenfor the sake of a nation's gold. These are savages... cannibals, some of them! - They don't even know the value of gold. - Value of gold! Kapatek-Anahuac! Is it God? An eagle? The sun or the moon? The throne carries a curse if it is removed from its rightful place. The other night... I dreamed... it was red with blood... If we were wisewe would hurl it overboard... The Neptune might sit on it without fear or remorse... but we poor mortals... And my ship? What will become of my men? Why was I born a Spaniard and not an Aztec? Why, Padre... are there never answers to the questions that truly matter? Why? Man that is born of woman hath but a short time to live and is full of misery. He cometh up and is cut down like a flower. We beseech Thee, o Lord... to receive into the depths of this ocean, upon which he sailed as... a brave captain and a valiant soldier, thy faithful servant... Don Jos Maria Alonso Ordonez de Linares y Escobar... Knight of the Order of the Holy Cross. What a creature! Proud as a peacock and twice as 'andsome. Ah oui, and those eyes... they burn like coals of fire. And that skin... smooth as peach, pardieu! The Lieutenant, you dunderhead. Guards, prepare to fire. Fire! Come and see this. Come here and look at this. Look, look at this. We'll all die of the plague! Get back in line, you dogs... in line, I say! Yeah. Hold, hold! I'm not the cook, I'm his replacement! I know nothing of this. I drink to the new Master After God of His Majesty's good ship "Neptune". Gentlemen, Don Alfonso Felipe Salamanca de la Torre. Don Alfonso! - Your Honor, mutiny a board. - A what? The men found a rat in the soup. The wrecked is tearing 'em up. Commander, turn up the guard. We must fight for the betterment of our conditions. We must claim... - our rights. - All your rights... no exceptions. - We can beat them, if we stand together. - Right. - Unity is strength! - Right. - And the soldiers, what about them? - They are our brothers... - We will talk to them. - They are sons of the people, like us. Right. The officers have bled us dry. Jesus said... "'Tis easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle... than for an officer toenter the kingdom of heaven. " The armory, lad... to the armory! Must be somewhere close by here. Ah, Corporal, we've come to mend a leak. - Leak? - Bosun's ordered is to help... the carpenter. His mates is down with the squitters. Must find this leak... 'Tis said to be close by the armory. Ah there. Vive la France! The keys... see if he's got the keys! - No keys, Cap'n. - Out o' the gunport with 'im! Holy Poker, that would've been too good to be true! Here, Froggie, give us a hand. I'm stuck. Move a muscle and I'll blow your brains out. Cut this quick! Look alive! These too! Ship's company! Your Captain will address you. Now then, what seems to be amiss? Come now, speak your minds! There's naught to be afraid of... this is no galley ship. Go on, go on, tell him... Well? Go on, tell him what happened. They... they... they're feeding us rats. - Rats? A rat. - We want to relieve ourselves in peace. - We're sick of the whip... - We want our rights... we want our rights. Easy man, easy! Don't all speak at once! We shall settle this matter amicably. You...! You...! You...! And you two over there... the cripple and his crony. Over here, all five of you! The rest of you, back to your posts! On the count of three... I shall consider you mutineers and give the command to fire. One! Two! Three! Gentlemen! It seems we have just been spared a mutiny occasioned by... this little rodent, which fell into the soup. And what, pray, does our learned physician make of this? 'Tis boiled? My late grandfather partook of several during the siege of... Cartagena, and never suffered any ill effects. - You heard that? - Aye, sir, we did. "Never suffered any ill effects". That is uncommon good news, you'll allow? - Aye, uncommon good, but... - But? Come... would you represent our surgeon's grandfather to be a liar? Nay, sir, I'd as soon slit me throat. Then kindly be seated. You are our guests. I trust you enjoy your meal, gentlemen. Could it be that you donot fancy Spanish rats? Why, but we do, sir, we thinks gold dust of 'em. - Alas, we have but one. - I pray you, sir, one will be... more than suffice... you are too kind. Some seasoning for our gourmets. I fear we have no vanilla... Would you not prefer the head? Nay, nay, lad, I wouldn't rob you of it. To the last morsel, if you please. For the love of heaven! Don Alfonso! You have demonstrated your dominion... over these wretches. We have all understood. Enough now! Stop this cruel jest, I implore you, stop it at once! Your desire is our command. Get it off. One! Two! - Three! - That's it, then. The whip for him, the rope for us. Six! Seven! Eight! Nine! Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with thee. Blessed art thou amongst... - women and blessed is the fruit of... - You might as well pray to a bowsprit. Hey, hey! No blasphemy, lade... not at this hour o' the watch. I do not want to die like a dog. I have a wife and babes. - I am still young, young! - O Jesus, in Thy infinite mercy. They haven't the spunk of a weevil. We must get ourselves out of this alone... - just you Froggie, and myself. - I'm with you, Captain! - You're a bullycock. - I'm with you too! - And me, and me! What's to be done? - Number one, stop gabbin'. Number two, - do as you're told. Where's the dagger? - In my satch, sir. Take it, Boomako. Twenty seven! That's it, that's it. Cut our ropes, cook, but have a care... just beside the knot, and mind you leave a strand or two. Having made their peacewith Almighty God... through the offices of Padre Don Antonio Fuentes, these four mutineers... are sentenced to be hanged by the neck until they are dead. May the Lord have mercy on their souls. - Shipmates, you shall be avenged. - Shut up you. You want the rope as well. Do you want it? Cause you can have it. My son, unburden your soul to Almighty God. At this supreme moment, you must confess your sins that they may be forgiven you. Matter of fact, Padre, I'd be glad to 'ave the benefit of your theological... advice, just in case of accidents. You never know. Resign yourself, my son. In a few moments you will be meeting your Maker. Well, meantimes... I should tell you that I had a mind to eat the Frog... and I'm a-feared bad luck may come of it. God created animals to be eatenby man, so why not a frog? - Come, my son, what else besides? - Beggin' your pardon, Reverend... but that's the Frog, standing alongside. 'Twas 'im I had a notion to eat. Now that is a serious matter. Proceed! Heave! Fire! Down with the officers! For the love of Jesus, have pity on him... No... Have pity. Frog... down to the armory, son! Hurry! Take some of the lads with you! Hold them back, hold the door. Put your weight behind it. Take them on deck. At your age... have you no shame? - Hands off the prisoners! - Easy now, hombre. If there's enough... - for one, there's enough for two. - Here's your shawl. I beg you to pardon the hole, mam'selle. Shipmates! Divine Providence has seen fit to deliver... this here vessel from the tyranny of your de-generate Hidalgo masters. I do hereby take possession of her in the name of brethren of the coast... and shall henceforth command her. I am Captain Thomas Bartholomew Red! Mercy, have pity... Long live Captain Red! Long live Captain Red! Long live Captain Red! What are you babbling about, you bakehead? - 'Ap'n... 'Ap'n...! - What captain? Where's that water? A ghost! A ghost! There, 'Ap'n! What's the fuss? Aye, 'tis Captain Red himself, flesh and blood... so don't stand there gaping. Sooner go getch us a good bottle of Hollands... you can see the Captain's got a thirst on him. Well, you old shark... got me 632 doubloons marked down in that vampire's account-book o' yourn? Strange you should ask, Captain. I was just casting an eye over your account... and indeed, you're right... aye, 'tis exactly the figure. Though the whole 632 might be difficult to raise at the moment... prices have gone up since you've been away... but with a sacrifice... I may manage, say, a hundred down and the balance over... let me se... three months? Would that be acceptable? Blood-sucker! You're tremblin'. Is it fever or fear? Neither one. I'm all a-tremble with pleasure at seeing you restored to life. And your best affidavit to thatwould be my 632 doubloons. See the course I lay? But! Great Heavens! What's this, Captain? You're short of a leg! Oh, an active man like yourself... what a tragedy! Belay that. Me doubloons! Hendrick, bring me over my casket, that I may count out 622 doubloons for... - Now we can talk business. - What business? You don't... You don't reckon. I'd come back empty-handed, do you? - I've got me a galleon! -Gold! - Ah, no gold, not at all. 'Ostages! - Not again! I've had a skilful of 'em... they're swarming like maggots all over the island. I swear I'll never touch another hostage. You keep 'em! There... six hundred... and thirty-two. Go fetch the Frog. - Is that one back as well? - Tell 'im to bring the hostages. - No, no... no thank you, not here! - Move, or you'll lose your ears! Harkee to this, Dutch... What? I've got... the niece of the Governor of Maracaibo, and the... - First Lieutenant of the "Neptune"! - First of third, who cares? For over 2 years now I've been trying to ransom the best-known lawyer in Spain. Nobody wants him, his wife, his children, the bar at Seville, not even for free! - Those halfwits did cut his tongue out. - Of course... a lawyer without a tongue! No, Red, no. I mean it. What with the traveling expenses, the go-betweens... the overheads... a hostage isn't even worth his keep these days. Neptune, Neptune... Let me see now, she was bound for Spain, was she not? - Aye... - And you say there was no gold on board? Come in, come in, me beauties, that I may present you to Dutch. - No, no! I don't want to see them! - Look, here she is... niece to the... Governor of Maracaibo. He'll cough up 3,000 at least. What's your name? Three thousand! Insolent scoundrel! If you knew your business you'd know... - I'm worth ten times as much! - Take them away! Get them out of here! Drown them if you've a mind too. I want nothing to do with 'em. You son of a double-dyed whore from the reeking gutters o' Rotterdam! A plague on your scurvy head... what's wrong with me 'ostages? They're hostages... that's enough! What's this here, then... horse-apples? Right! - So how much for him... a hundred? - Not even. Last July Carlos the... Portuguese negotiated an arch-bishop for only 325. So a padre... you can imagine! You might dump him in Shark's Cove... he's not worth the price of his sandals. We'll speak of it later. Our of your juice, vulture! You're givin' a party! Aye, m'hearties, 'tis I. I've lost a drumstick, true, but the rest's all Cap'n Red! I'm half-seas over with joy at seein' your friendly physiognomies again. Diddler... still alive and kickin'? You old skulk, you! Where's Meat-Hook! Ah, there you be... sour-faced as ever. Bibleback! Not grown much straighter, have you? So Moonhead... took me for Satan himself out there, did you? Soiled your linen, did you? Strike me blind, you've as muchto say as a shoal o' mackerel! Look at me! Four years and more on a poxy desert island... yet I can still crack a smile. What ails you all? Had your tongues pruned like that dago lawyer? That's better, me hearties. Let's make the rafters ring! We'll drain the Dutchman's cellar... drinks are on the house. Life's a bed o' roses! Dang me buttons! That were worse'n a Spanish broadside! We thought you was killed at Boca del Toro. Saint's blood, that's what I thought myself! So did the Spaniards likewise... else we'd not be here now. Shan't forget Boca del Toro for quite a while. Never did more killing... - in all my life... Did I, Frog? - Never Cap'n. Why, you should've seen old Froggie here, screamin' "Vive la France!" And layin' about him like a demon. That was your day, son, was it not? Well, 'tweren't mine. Damnation... cannon ball tore one leg to shreds. Hey, Scratch! That rum... do we get it today or tomorrow? Directly, Captain, directly. Moonhead, surprise, fetch up another keg. - I wan' hear 'Ap'n Red! - Do as you're told, wretch! All that remained of the Black Princess - a few spars and suchlike... broke up on the reefs of that accursed island. Four and a half years' scrimplin' on turtle-meat and coconuts... Aye, purgatory it was... not like the good ship "Neptune"... where these generous Spanish officers received us like princes. Come, come! Join our little party! Now's your chance... you've earned it. Shift yer arses! Make room for the gen'le folk! Free our guests' flippers, that they may drink me health! 'Avin' been so 'andsomely received at your table, sir... I 'ope I may prevail upon you to accept me 'ospitality. An officer of the Royal Fleet does not drink with pirates. It takes all kinds to make a world, does it not, Padre? It does indeed, my son, it does indeed. As we hear from Dutch, an expert in these matters... you're not worth a bag o' nails. So, pirate that I am, I find myself obliged to have your hanged from... the yardarm of your beloved "Neptune". You'll be dancin' a jig on air... - come day-break. What say you to that? - Death means less to me than... dishonor! Had you the courage, you would confront me sword in hand. You will not deign to drink with us, yet you would taste our steel. Well, I have it in mind to play a little game we never tire of... me mates and I, which I myself call Dead Man's Nag. Legs a thoroughbred! To the death, gentlemen. And if any rider's feet touch the ground before he's skewered... I'll have you hanged... prompt, riders and nags alike. Do not be distressed, mam'selle, 'tis only a sport. There, that's better! I like that! The winner's life shall be spared. Cap'n Red gives his word on it. Tell me, I was just wondering, the throne or Kapatek-Anahuac... - Who? - Kapatek-Anahuac... - Never 'eard of 'im. - Well, I gather... I thought the "Neptune"... - I heard a rumor that... - What rumor? Nothing... Just idle gossip. Nothing. You've been blabbin' about me throne, you dog! No, not a word, Captain, not a word! Mum as a clam, I swear! Get up! Get up, get up! Get up, get up. Yah, uh... Damn it! Get up! Get up! And who might you be, sir? It must be that lawyer the Dutchman spoke of. Is it you, sir, whose tongue these dogs have cut out? Heaven be praised! Can you assist us? Do you have a plan? - What does he mean? - He appears to be to be thirsty. Thristy? Ridiculous! What is that to us? He wants some rum. In the name of His Majesty, I command you to help us... we need arms. Give him some rum! What! Three more barrels? Over my dead body... you tell him that. I'd rather you told him yourself. "Three barrels of rum are to be taken aboard the "Neptune". May God help you. " - Good fortune! - All our hopes go with you, my son. Quite so, quite so. Give us a blessing. Quick, quick! Where are those barrels? Come! Come on, mates, that's it! I took bets on who could drink fastest. You mean the most! Who cares how long it takes? I was thinking: if we were to keep one of these three barrels... - would there not still be two left? - What do you say? - Keep it how? - Roll it over the side. - It would sink. - Nay, it'll float... we can moor it to the anchor and pick it up later. Now! No, later! Long live the King! Thanks be to God, who in his infinite wisdom has put an end to this mutiny. The buccaneer is dead. So is his crony. Here's a man of mettle... one who put loyalty before treason. He suffered terribly inthe fray, poor soul... but his valor shall not go unrewarded. How say you, Gonzalez? - Long live the King! - Long live the King! Long live the King! - Long live the King! - Long live the King! A roving, a roving Since roving's been my ruin I aim We'll go no more a roving With you fair maid - Why do you always stare at me? - Captain Red commanded me... - not to take my eyes off you. - You are very obedient. I do my duty. Is he perhaps frightened that I shall grow wings and fly away? - Perhaps. - And you, sir? - I, mam'selle? - Why did you come to my rescue? Why did you kill one ofyour comrades for my sake? Ahoy there, sonny! Come over here by us! Or take her into the bushes! Ah! Very good morning to you, Master Carpenter. I was just a'wonderin' if you had any further need o' me ring? Since I've been parted from it, 'tis as though I were missin' a finger. Here it is. As good as new. To arms! To arms! To arms! On your feet swine! On your feet! On your feet...! Up, up... You too, get up... Get up. Me throne. Me throne! Here, you cut-throats... you forgot your trademark! Better luck in the next world! - What will they do with us? - Rest easy, my pigeon. I saw you born and I shall see you married. Your safety is precious... - to these cut-throats. - Yet they are not all wicked men. That Frenchman, for instance... He seems different... Anaconda Bay... that's where we'll hide. All quiet topside? Aye, sir. All shipshape and seaworthy. Tide'll be up by eight bells. Who goes there? Password! 'Tis, Maria Dolores Eugenia del Alcade. Seorita! This Padre and his brave companions have delivered me from the pirates' clutches. - Conduct me to my uncle. - At once, Seorita... - I will call the Officer of the Watch. - My son... I have a communication of paramount importance to impart to His Excellency. Kindly convey us thither with the utmost discretion. No one else may know ofme presence 'ere... so batten down yer 'atches! - Well? Did you hear what the Padre said? - Directly, Seorita! Your uncle will rejoiceto see you safe and sound. We have all been praying for you, Seorita. Hell's bells! Permit me to rouse my poor uncle, else he may die of apoplexy. Uncle Archibaldo! 'Tis I, Dolores! Wake up... wake up, I bessech you! - Uncle Archibaldo! - That'll do! On yer feet, Archie! Oh forgive me, Lord! San Antonio deliver me from all these demons! 'Tis Dolores, your niece! Eh! Are we all dead? - Where am I, Father? - I'm not your father, idiot! I'm Cap'n Red! - Thomas Bartholomew Red! - Himself... but pressed for time. Now bend your earto this: I've got your niece here... and I'll trade her for the throne of Kapatek-Anahuac. What insolence! That throne belongs to the Spanish Crown! No longer, you old whale! I want it! At once! Never! Do you understand? Never! - Go on, sonny! - Where, Cap'n? Rape! - What are you waiting for? - I... I can't. - 'Tis an order! - I know Cap'n... - yet... no! - Insubordination! - Boomako, stand in for this traitor! - Aye, Cap'n. No, no, save me, sir, for pity's sake listen to your heart! Surely, my virtue is worth a throne? - You agree then? - Never! You shall see what stuff a Spanish Governor is made of! Monster! At least have the grace to kill me before you dishonor me! Cap'n, can't you see? He doesn't care two coppers for his niece! - Let's have his eye out! - No! Aye, there's a pretty notion! Let's take a peek at 'is brains! Spare him, I beg you! I will give you my jewels... all my jewels! Have pity on him. I implore you, for the sake of the mother that... bore you in her womb! Oh, my gout! My gout! Get off, quick! You're killing me! Help! Hel... " Stop! Stop! Stop! In the name of the Holy Virgin, stop! - The throne! - Give him his throne! Go fetch it... Captain, go, but don't touch my foot again. By the Holy Eternal, don't touch my foot! Out of yer crib! Now be a good lad and do as you're told. Else... Take your pen! Here, set this down... - "I Archibaldo... " - I... - Eh, what's your name? - Archibaldo Estban del Acalde. "I Archibaldo... yes, yes, and the rest of it... Governor of Maracaibo... " - Knight of the Holy Sepulchre... - Stow that! Write: "... of Maracaibo... do hereby discharge First Lieutenant Don Alfonso de la Torre... of all responsibility for me throne... " No, no, no, for the conveyance of the throne of Kapatek-Anahuac to Spain. " Enter! Your Excellency! - My respects, seora. - Lieutenant, we are in a grave... predicament! The pirates attack at dawn! Let them come! We shall be ready for them! Calm yourself! This blackmore contrived to escape from their lair... he knows their plans. Speak up, my good man. - It, 'tis I, Lieutenant... 'tis Boomako! - What! That black dog here? That renegade? I'll settle his score here and now! - Governor, Governor! Protect me! - You shall die, mutineer! - I grant him pardon! - His rightful place is on the scaffold... - garroted with the rest of them. - Don Alfonso! Kindly bear in mind that... I alone am responsible for the administration of justice. As you say, Excellency. But this reptile sough to poison... - Captain Avila de Linares! - Not true! - I loved the Captain like my own mother! - Shut your mouth, murderer! Restrain yourself, Lieutenant. You are addressing a pardoned man. He's the one! He jealous! He poison our good Captain! It's possible. Your pardon, Excellency? I cannot hear you. Was saying that this cursed gout makes me suffer the tortures of the damned! A plague upon it! But enough of my afflictions. Time is against us, Don Alfonso. Captain Red... that filthy ayeee... I mean, that noted gentlemen of fortune... intends to board the "Neptune", at dawn and take delivery of his... That is, steal the throne of Kapatek-Anahuac. - I'll make mincemeat of him! - In the meantime, I have resolved... as follows: the throne will be taken into safekeeping... by two secret envoys of mine. They will come bearing a letter which... will absolve you of all further responsibility. That is all. - You may withdraw. - Very good, sir. And the password? Password? Er, oh, let me see... - Gout is gold". - old is gold.

I come to bid you farewell. And to thank you... Farewell? Fate wished us enemies... yet you have twice saved my honor. - You are leaving? - This every evening I sail for Spain. - Pardieu! This evening! - And... - And? - My uncle has... Don Alfonso has been promoted Captain of the "Neptune". - I'm so unhappy Monsieur Malfiltre. - Call me Jean-Baptiste. There is more: my uncle has betrothed me to Don Alfonso! - Against my will! - What do you have in your little basket? My little angel! God bless your kindly heart! I, I have not yet told you the worst tidings at all. Tomorrow, at dawn... - You are both to be... garroted. - What about the throne? Captain... You are to be... Tomorrow, at dawn... - I 'eard yer, but where's the throne? - We don't give a damn for your throne! He don't truly mean it... he's just shook up. The throne is back on the "Neptune". Captain, the Lord teaches us forgiveness. I shall pray for your soul. Farewell, Jean-Baptiste. Hell's bells! Blasted chain! No sweeter voice could complement a sunset of such breath-taking splendor. Thank you, Captain. To be Master of as fine a vessel as this would gladden the heart of any man alive. - I am sure of it. - Yet for me 'tis not enough. I mean to wait until such time as you may deign to appreciate my qualifies... and so... may come to love me. - Goodnight, Dolores. - Goodnight, sir. Go on, dance! Dance, dance! Fire at will!

Aah! - There, there... where my finger is! - That little speck? Yes, my lad. That little speckis a brig. I hope 'tis not a pirate, Captain. Have no fear of pirates, seora. They would receive a warm welcome... the "Neptune" carries 70 cannon. She's the fastest galleon in the Royal Fleet. - The fatest? - Yes, sir. Take that craft there. A brig... every stitch of canvas out, yet... she hasn't gained a cable's length on us since dawn. - Why should she follow us? - She is not following us... she is merely sailing in the same direction. Now! That's just to put some fire in your bellies! No goin' back now. 'Tis victory or death! To board! Into the longboat with you! Take some vittles! Secret mission! Come, girl. Come on, put your backs in it. That's it, lower... What do you want to do? Have some music? Oh my God! Stop you sobbing stupid woman! Over the side! Dolores! Boomako... Boomako! No, not up, down... Help! Over here... Frog... Frog...! Thanks you alive. Hey!... Hey!... The rope, Frog, the rope! Quick! Cut it! Merde! 'Tis an order! You signed articles! Cut it or I'll have you hanged! Hold on! Wait! Wait! Right. Wait, wait, you lily-livered scoundrel! Come back and fight... like a man! Canaille... Fripouille... Cornegidouille...! Alfonso, you scum! I'll hunt you down... I'll skin you alive! e's an end to you once and for all, you slimy French Jean-Baptiste! Aah, Captain! Boomako is dead! Come back! Come back! May you rot in hell! Hey, Frog... What o'clock is it? - Six or eight... - Good. Give us an 'am and a bottle of Malaga. Don't pull that face, damn you! Drink! Eat! We're alive, aren't we? - And Frog? - Yes, Cap'n. Would you do me a kindness? Sing a little, while I nod off... and mind you sing, don't bray like a donkey. Sing that little French ditty I've a liking for.
