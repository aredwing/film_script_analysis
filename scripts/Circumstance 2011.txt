Present. Zahra Latifpour. Present. Maryam Hedayat. Present. Tannaz Hemmati. Present. Shireen Arshadi. Present. Tahereh Asghari. Present. Fatemeh Shirazi. Present. Marziyeh Zarindoost. Present. Atafeh Hakimi. Present. Everyone dismissed except Miss Shireen Arshadi. Please stay to speak with the headmaster. - I'll come with you. - No. Sorry, I'm in a hurry. We have a biology exam today. I'm her lab partner, so I'll just wait for her. You've been busy all month. I can arrange for plenty of free time... At your service, ma'am. We usually don't let people like you into our school. Do you know why? No, ma'am. Because their character is questionable. You're late again with this semester's tuition. Sorry, Madam Teacher, it's my fault. I borrowed some money from Shireen, but... Take it back. Bring it to my office later. Get to class. "Your character is questionable." Cello suites, Bach. More specific. The cellist, the key, the movement. Pablo Casals. Minuet in D Minor. Cello suites, Bach. Mehran! The student has beaten his teacher. The prodigal son. Welcome home. Are you well? Mom has made one of her special cakes. God help us. Eat it for your mother's sake. Azar! How about this one? Mehran. Here he is, as good as new. You've gotten so thin. Are you feeling better? Mehran, I ran into Professor Jamshid at the University yesterday. There might be an opening in the music department. Music isn't for me anymore, Father. What are you saying? I'm sorry, Father. Mehran, you've worked so hard... What, are you scared? I told my uncle that I'd be home. Come on, I'll make you a respectable girl yet. So, what's your name? Let's see if you earn the privilege to know my name. Vanak Square. What's your rush? We're having fun. Turn it up! This song is orgasmic. Who is it? We're here for the sewing class. Let me introduce you to my friend. - Salaam. - Salaam. This is my cousin, Hossein, who's coming from America. America. I'm gonna go dance. Don't worry. Tonight, I'm your professor. Shireen, Ho-bag. Ho-bag, Shireen. Protection's in the drawer. Ho-bag? Don't worry about it. I can't hear you. Let's go somewhere we can talk. Can I ask you a question? Does it make you jealous? Why would I be jealous? Isn't he your boyfriend? Boy, that's how it's done. I knew you weren't such a good girl. Open your mouth. Hey, check this out. Beautiful sparkles. Pour moi? Pour toi, madame. This isn't necessary anymore. Dad, I'm not going to fuck up again. I'm sorry. This is your weekly allowance. I need all your receipts. Kids, I have to get to work. Mehran, I have to tell you something. You'll die of laughter. Hello. - Mehran, are you OK? - Leave me be. Why can't you understand, I'm better. I was just... I know exactly what the fuck you were trying to do. Can you help a brother? Could you help a brother? Here, brother. Take this food. My wife made it. If you want help, I know a place that can help you. Those addicts won't even leave the mosque in peace. The mosque is a place for everyone. God is compassionate. I'm only here because of God's mercy. Seeing young believers like yourself gives one hope. I'm Mohammad Mehdi. Your name, sir? Pardon me. My name is Mehran. So dear Mehran, what do you do? What's your profession? A true Muslim needs to work and provide for a family. God has not willed it yet. Believe in God's plan. He will provide. Good morning, mother. Morning, son. Shireen, put on some clothes. You have a suitor. Yusef, please have a seat. Shireen! Bring the tea. Yusef, I present my niece, Shireen. Did something happen? It's nothing. What a heavy surgery. My back and feet are killing me. I'm not that scary. Tell me if something is wrong, OK? Mehran... Tomorrow, we're all going to the seaside. Be ready at 7 A.M. Is that all, Dad? That's all. Seems like yesterday, they were children. Seems like yesterday, we were young. Little devil. Dad, let's go swimming. You're all sweaty. Go in the water. One day we can all go in together. Mommy. I'm scared. It's nothing. You're just a bit sick. I love you. I know. I want to tell you something. You don't need to, I already know. Really? Let's run away to Dubai. You'll sing and I'll be your manager. You're delirious. In Dubai, anything is possible. It's cold. Scared? Dad, pull over. Are you sick? It is time for my prayers. You're joking. No, it's not a joke. Atafeh and Mr. Hakimi will be here soon. I'll bring tea. Just wait a second... This system is hopeless. Wait, it will get fixed. I haven't attached the cord and you're testing. Can I help? With the will of God. I'm grateful. How I love this song! I know it's a bit late. But I just wanted to say Happy Birthday. Thanks. It was three weeks ago. One day I'll win it. The young can dream. Let's go abroad. A place we can be free. We'll go to clubs. We'll have fun. Sweet! Do you feel embarrassed? A little. You know what this dork wants to do here? Tell us. Dub "Milk" into Persian. In the film where Sean Penn is gay? Milk's non-violent protests led to a movement. We'd be like Che. Here they make Che into a God-fearing man. But they can't co-opt a gay figure. Yes, they can. They're experts. They'll make Milk lead the anti-gay movement. Exactly. Don't you want to change your circumstances? President Hossein Obama! Change has come our way. Hey, don't make fun of Obama. Don't you see? What they were doing to the gays they're doing to you now. We'll rock the country with this film. We'll pour into the streets. We're united together, we are gay together. We knew you were gay. Don't worry, Atie. I'll take the role of Milk. You play his lover, Diego Luna. Does that mean I can fuck you? - Yes, please. - Sweet! This film is not about fucking. It's about human rights. Fucking is a human's right. I swear it's a human's right. Listen. We dub "Milk" in the day for your subversive politics. And "Sex and the City" for mainstream subversion. Isn't that a porn film? It's always the same with you, Joey. You're really sick. "Sex and the City" will sell like crazy. And we'll throw "Milk" on the same DVD. I want to create serious dialogue. Sweetie, here anything illegal becomes politically subversive. Political acts aren't that romantic, Atafeh. With the parents that you had, subversion and naughtiness is in your blood. Shut up, Joey. I can defend myself. What did I say? What did I say? Do you mind if I play music? No, it's a nice song. Very relaxing. We can go somewhere relaxing. Excuse me? Don't be coy. You're mistaken. What do you take me for? What do you think you are? Sir, please stop the car. Don't think the clothes fool me. Stop. I want to get out. No matter how you dress yourself, trash is trash. How about we go to the police station? I have some friends there. Give me your foot. Excuse me? I just want your foot. You think I'm hot? Like it? Feels good? Go to hell. Mehran! We've missed you, man. There is a killer afterparty. Go, go, go, go, go, go! Go, go, go, go, go, go! Go, go, go, go, go, go! Go, go, go, go, go, go! Go, go, go, go, go, go! Shireen! Get down! Oh, my God, are you okay? Hossein, let's dub those scenes. That was awesome. Fuck the mothers of all the mullahs who shit all over this country. To Hollywood! Where's your energy? Dance. Are you OK? Don't tell me what to do. Morality Police! Morality Police! Morality Police. - Hurry! - Shireen! Go! Go! Thank God you got away too. I haven't done anything. Mehran. Please, tell him. Don't be afraid. We have nothing against you. Ali, my dear. You piece of shit. You worthless trash. Always the same mistakes. I have homework to do. Let's eat. Let's wait for your big brother. Thank you for the feast, Mom. Is there any more breast? Wait. Here you go. Azar, don't you think the boy has become strange? No, not at all. Didn't you want breast? Is it because I used my hands? What? You think I'm dirty? I pray, so I know I'm clean. You, I'm not so sure of. Oh, you found some. Thank you, Mommy. Pig. I know you're angry. I'm angry too. Cut. Joey... That was good but... make his voice more gay. More gay. Could you do that? More gay? Yes, please. More gay. OK. Action! I know you're angry. I'm angry too. OK, cut. Joey, he's gay. But not that gay. Get lost. OK, OK. Let's do it again. Action. I know you're angry. I'm angry too. Let's march the streets of San Francisco and share our anger. Yes. Who's your Daddy? Yeah. Oh! Say my name. OK, kids, cut. Cut. Cut. Cut! Cut! Cut. Joey, less. Guys aren't that loud. Shireen, breathe more. Exhale. It's not a Lamaze class. You're not giving birth. Yeah. OK. Action! I love your body. Yeah, again. Your left hand. Cut. Cut. Fuck me. Will you fuck me? Fuck me. - Yeah. - Fuck me. Yeah. Cut! Cut! Cut, cut, cut! OK, Joey, please, let me direct. There's one director now. Why are you making donkey sounds? Ladies here don't make those sounds. Maybe you just don't know how to produce them. From now on, my name is Samantha. Tonight, you're going to fuck me. - Fuck me. - Fuck me. Fuck me. Why won't you fuck me? Yeah, baby. Yeah, baby. Get her. Pull over. Don't be afraid, my child. You're not responsible for your parents' mistakes. Is it true your parents were writers? Anti-revolutionary writers? Face the wall, you whore. You have no right to look at us. Understand? Answer his question. These tactics might work with your clients, but they don't work here. Answer his question. My parents were professors. Do you think you can avenge their deaths by doing this? Is my brother telling a joke? Hung from a rope, you won't be laughing. You know in these cases of anti-government activity, we're forced to do a complete physical examination. With what right? You had no such permission. We don't need your permission. Especially you, who can't control his daughter. Do you know who you're talking to? You're not in a position to play that card. Please, take a seat. Why is it your 16-year-old daughter is not a virgin, but... Know your place. Money brings power, I know. But you're not responsible enough to control your own daughter. I once had a daughter too. God rest her soul. She's not dead. She's alive. She lives on the other side of the ocean. But for me, she is dead. Raising a daughter is difficult, I know. It costs so much. Yes, a lot. So we understand each other. Completely. How much to forget this? We're all forced to play this game. You should be ashamed. You're all garbage, filthy whores. Answer me. Answer me. Are you deaf or dumb? And you call yourself an actress? You think, because of who your father is, you can do whatever you want? Where is Shireen? Shireen, do you need a ride home? My uncle is coming with the deed to his house. A generous uncle. Sister, your parents are here. Fix your headscarf. Good girl. I'll stay with you, until your uncle comes. He is going to kill me. What's so funny? You can go. I took care of everything. How? I could do something, so it all disappears from your record. And you won't even have to go to court. My face is burning. So damn hot in here. Not as hot as hell. Atafeh, this time, I'll forgive you. We're all human. We make mistakes. But if we repeat the same mistakes, then we're no different than animals. After months of investigation, the Revolutionary Guards were able to infiltrate a secret anti-government political cell... Shireen. Now you must get married. No more discussion. That's that. The leader of the spies is Hossein Shekarkhar, born in Ohio and a Harvard University student. Using his dual citizenship as a guise, he was able to conduct his covert spying operation sponsored by the American and Israeli governments. This dangerous American spy is set to stand trial at the Freedom Courts. Hurry. A five-hour hike is no joke. Yes, Doctor. I have guests today, I need your help. Look at the beautiful blossoms. You never used to be this slow! Respect your elders! I'll show you. You think you can beat me? Let's take a tiny break here. Like it? Have some water. Save it for yourself. I have plenty. Don't squander it on an old man. Just have some, Daddy. I used to come here during college. When we weren't protesting in the streets, we would rip off our clothes and jump in the water. We'd create such a ruckus. The park ranger would chase us with his baton. "You bastards!" We would grab our stuff and run buck naked to our car. I was once rebellious. I know what it means to be young. Are you done? God, see how she treats her father? What's God got to do with it? Don't be disrespectful. You all created this world for us with that revolution of yours. Now we're forced to live under these circumstances. Have I done so wrong? I've done all this because of you. What's gotten into you? You have everything at your disposal. If you think somewhere else is better, go! If you're tired, go back. I'll continue alone. Rush up, rush down. Rush up, rush down. What's the point? It's exercise, it's good for your heart. You know what's good for my heart? Being with my daughter. You're getting sentimental in your old age. Ready? Why don't you go on ahead? Like you suggested, I'll go home. Are you sure, Dad? Are you sure? Yes, I am sure. At least, take the water. No need. - Daddy. - Go, Atie. Why didn't you tell me? Nothing has happened. They're here to talk. I just don't understand. She's ruining herself. Mehran, out. - Out. - I'm going. Why did you get me out? Should we have left you there? You don't even know what it means to be in a place like that. You're not a child anymore. Stop these games. I didn't raise you like this. Don't get caught up in these things. At least do something of worth. Sometimes, we have to accept our reality. Atafeh, my beautiful little girl. My sweet baby. Remember how I used to sing to you. With the permission of my uncle and grandmother, I accept. I bought it today. It's nice. With the payment from my first contract, I will build a six-bedroom home for me, Shireen and, God willing, our children. Azar, I'm going to Vanak if you want a ride. Shireen, can you imagine it? Imagine here, huge windows facing the garden. And here, we could plantjasmine trees. Do you like jasmine trees? What do you like? Mehran, I haven't talked to Atie in so long. Can I go with her? - Sweetheart, no. - Why? Atafeh and her friends got you into trouble. But Mehran. Let's go. I can't do this anymore. Nothing has changed. I love you. How can you say that? Is it better if I were in jail? Or here with you? I did this all for you. Firouz darling, bring the wine for our guests. I want to play you something. I learned this dish at Berkeley. Very, very special. OK. Mehran, Atafeh. A song for your mother. No, Shireen wrote a lovely new song that she must perform for us. Sing it for us, my dear. Shireen is talented, isn't she? Absolutely, talented and beautiful. But I don't like my wife singing in public. But it's just us here. Still, I don't want my wife to sing. You're ridiculous. Atafeh shouldn't sing either. Mehran. But that's up to you. You control your daughter, I'll control my wife. Have you become a fanatic? Going to turn us all in tonight? It's not a concert, it's family and friends. Atafeh and I will sing. "I can't do this anymore." "I love you. Nothing has changed." "How can you say that?" "How can you say that?" "Is it better if I were in jail, or here with you? I did this all for you." Why can't I be enough? Why can't I be enough? Mr. Tabrizi? Visa and ticket for Dubai. Father's permission stamped in your passport? Tonight at nine. What's wrong? What's wrong, Shireen? What's wrong? We're alone. We're alone today. What's wrong with you? Are you afraid? What are you afraid of? Are you afraid of this? Is that it, Shireen, you afraid of this? Is that what you're afraid of? Why? We can leave.
