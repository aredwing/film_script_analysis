Oh, really? Mm-hm. I told them all about you. They think you're so cute. I showed them pictures. You're such a liar. Why would I lie about that? Oh, I got this one. Oh, thank you. Okay. That's the only reason, then? Pretty much. I was thinking we could transfer to L.A, and we check out Tokyo, Thailand-- No, too crazy, too many people. Paula, it beats BNA any day. Come on. But my fianc's in Nashville. It's never too late to escape. Oh, wow, great advice from my maid of honor. Who's stalking you now? Only guy that matters. Dad. Aww. He wants me to go to flight school.

It's running around, barking, being weird. Thunderstorms out of the south, southwest. Church group canceled, so we're nearly empty. How long you been working the aisles, Jenny? Oh, uh, almost a year now, captain. Then you should know better. Sorry, sir. Ha, ha, ha. So gullible. Heard the concert was great. Rochambeau? Really? Sorry. Jenny, this is George.

Haven't seen my husband for over a year. But I'm home for a while now, so... He's a lucky man. Ryan, obviously you are mistaking me for somebody that gives a crap. I'm sorry, sir, we are airborne so you're gonna have to end that call. It's against FAA regulations to use any sort of cellular equip-- You're compromising our safety. Who the fuck are you, man? If he keeps using his cell phone, we're gonna arrest him when we land. Did you hear that? Give me the phone. Okay? You're an asshole. Okay. Fucking asshole. You don't see me doing your job. I'm sorry. That was stupid, but some people can be so inconsiderate. Exactly. Then you really don't want my job. Doesn't it make you wonder about the human race? Try not to overthink things. I'm sorry. I'm gonna shut up now. Um... So do you got any solutions? Well, sure. The few of us that give a damn have to make change. It's our responsibility, right? I think I have all the responsibility I can handle at the moment. Yeah. Right. I can see that. Yeah. Hey, I apologize for the lecture. I'm just finishing my PhD, nights, and I'm always boring strangers, kindergarteners, beautiful flight attendants. It's not boring. It's interesting. Henry. Uh, Jenny. It's nice to meet you, Jenny. You're gonna need to put your cat back in the bag. I don't know how he got out. He's usually so well-behaved, he never leaves the apartment building. There you go, sweetie. Back in your little house. Autopilot. How was your weekend? Not too bad. Went somewhere? No, I played golf. Played terrible. Lost another six balls-- Oh, my God, I'm sorry. You have a handkerchief? What does the FAA say about blow jobs? Well, as long as your tray table is in the upright position... So, what's going on? Just talking. He's super smart. Uh-huh. He get your number yet? No. Not yet. The night's still young, though. Oh, I'll get it. Okay. Hey, what's up? I just need some water. Are you feeling okay? I just- Just need something to drink. Okay.

He probably just had one too many on the back nine. Hi, what can I get you to drink? Hey. Can I just have a tea? Oh, sure. As the investigation gets-- Go ahead. Thank you. Of course. - The situation continues to be serious, with the exception of heavily protected military... What's going on? You know, they don't know. They don't know yet. It's some apartment building in L.A. Where in L. A? I have no idea. Maybe downtown. Ooh. Yeah. It's good we're flying away. Okay. Well, enjoy your tea. Thank you very much. What can I get you? Yeah, we're good. We're just finishing up. Let us know if you need anything. Okay. Okay. Thanks, captain. Um... Sir? Can you hear me? Sir? Ugh! Oh! Oh. Paula, a little help. Oh, man. Big guy just puked all over the stewardess. Oh, God. Here. Are you all right? He's sick. He's really sick. Okay, you stay here, I'll be right back. Stop the plane. Let me off! No, no.

FAA needs the passenger's name now. Jenny, grab this. "Mr. Ralph Bundt." B-U-N-D-T. I need a rest. Thank you. You feel nauseous, like you wanna barf? I'm telling you I'm okay. You've had a concussion, so we'll need to get you checked out. George, I'm so sorry. If you're really sorry, get me off this freaking plane. Are you a doctor? Medic. Get some ice for that contusion and keep a close eye on him. If he starts acting strange or sleepy-- I understand. I'll help keep an eye on him. Thank you. He's out. Paula, I panicked out there. I was useless. I didn't do anything right. Hey, hey, hey. It's fine, okay? You did your best. It's done. It's over. Okay? Come here. We've been instructed to get our passenger immediate medical attention. Everyone in their seats, belts fastened. It's Paula. Secure the cabin for landing. FAA wants us on the ground now. We gotta punch through that weather. Gonna be a rough drop. It certainly is. All passengers, prepare for severe turbulence. Hang on tight. Ladies and gentlemen, we're executing an immediate emergency landing. Please secure all loose items and tray tables. What the fuck is going on? As a safety precaution, give Jenny your attention as she demonstrates the bracing position. Lean forward. Hands on top of your head. Elbows against your thighs. Okay. Here we go. Hold on. Hang on! Hold on. Sir, can I have the laptop? My presentation's on there. I need that. Brace. Brace, everyone. Cabin's secure. Not yet. Okay. Roll him to my side on three, okay? One, two, three. Ugh! Hurry. Oh, God. It's not gonna fit. I'm gonna get his extender. All right, hurry. Negative 0597. Ma'am. Ma'am. Argh! Oh, God! Jesus. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Willsy, get back there. We're about to land. Oh, please, don't let me die in the air. Oh, my God. It's gotta be something. Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, God. Get us out of here. Ground Control, I need a gate assignment. What's the holdup? Ground Control. Don't let him out! Keep him in there! Oh, shit. Where's your EMK? Get it. Come on, come on, come on. Okay. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. Hold that. Keep the pressure on it. Okay. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. You okay? What? Only two lousy doses of lidocaine? What is that? It's a sedative. It'll keep her from going into shock until we can get her to a hospital. Give me your scarf. Okay, okay. Hold it. She's bleeding out. Just hold on. Hold on. She's bleeding out. Please hurry. You gotta keep pressure on this wound. Come on! Ground Control, I have a critically injured FA and a violent passenger onboard. Why are we stopped? Tower's not clearing us for a gate. Why not? They won't tell us. Captain! What are we gonna do? Hold your position. Ground Control, we can't hold. We gotta do something. Willsy, find us an open gate. Captain! What's going on? Gate 87 is closest. Ground Control, I'm taking Gate 87. I need EMS, police, cavalry there to meet us. Come on. Ground Control, I need that Jetway operational. Ground Control? Two o'clock. He sees us. You fucked up, lady. Wrong gate, wrong airline. TS Air operates out of Terminal A. My shift is over. Evacuate! Evacuate! What the hell's going on? Go. Go. Shit. Get some help. Easy, easy. Get off the plane! Careful. Careful. Get off the plane, now! Go, go, go. We're getting out of here. Get them to the gate! Go on, get off the plane. What's going on? What's going on? Come on. Come here. Stay with me. I need you to open up Gate 87. I got an injury here from flight-- It's TS Air 318. TS Air 318. Come in. Why aren't they answering? Open the fucking door! Hey, calm down. Okay, okay. Everybody just try to stay calm. Hobbs, open the gates right now. This woman needs to get to a hospital immediately. Okay, okay. The other side. Come on, come on, George. Shit. George. Go, go, go. Hold the door for me. Hold the door. Okay, you got it. Hurry. Jenny, what are you doing here? Gate's locked. We're gonna take the passengers out a different way. What about-? He tired himself out. We got it under control. Take the passengers to safety then get back here with help. Come on, Jenny. Come on! Take off. Okay. Come on. Okay, okay. Come on. Okay. Hey, where are we? Ramp-op staging area. Where all the shit gets done that you'll never see. How's your head? Good. Okay. Well, brilliant job on that plane. Thanks. Where is everybody? At home, where I should be. This terminal is off-line till 3 a. M. Shut down for maintenance. We need to take her down this flight of stairs to tarmac level. You, help me. Let's go. Easy, all right? On three. One, two, three. Through that door, it'll take you to the main concourse. This has never been locked before. Come on. Don't you have the keys? The tarmac level, it's automated. They got us on lockdown. Lockdown? What? You ever heard of terrorism? This was retrofitted after 9/11. It's a high-security zone. Like being in a supermax, right? Every way in or out is monitored and controlled by those terminal ops watching us. Why are we in lockdown? You tell me, lady. Fuck this. Damn it. This is not okay. What are you gonna do? How long have you been working here? Come in. There's gotta be something- You have to figure out something. Hey! I just move the bags, people. Don't yell at me, all right? Wait, wait! Can you hurry this up, man? We got places to go. For real. Quiet! Quiet! Oh, thank God. They're coming. George, be careful. Why'd they stop? Attention, Flight 318. Do not attempt to leave the terminal. Help is on the way. You are now under quarantine. I don't know what to do. Everything's just gone wrong. I don't know what to tell these people. We're stuck. Daddy, please just call me as soon as you get this. I need you to tell me what to do. Hey, did you get ahold of your parents? They're gonna murder you. Heh, heh. Yeah, I would too. Hey, come here. I just got through to 911. They don't know anything about this. What? Yeah. I don't understand. What did they say? I'm telling you right now, nothing. What the hell's this? What are they doing? Why are they lighting us up? How long is this gonna take? I got a job interview at 9 a. M. What am I gonna tell my husband? I am not missing my sister's wedding for this. Stop it! Shh! You just go fetch the captain, honey. We need somebody in charge. I understand. We need information. My wife is six months pregnant. How old are you anyway? I'm really sorry. That's not good enough. Everybody just take it easy. You got no right to keep us here. You got no right. She won't make it unless I stop the bleeding. If I could get to my field kit, I could maybe buy her some time. Where's your kit? In my bag. I checked it. Shit. Shit. Hey, you. Uh- Ed, can you get me into the hold? The hold? Yeah. You didn't see that army outside? The hold's access panel's right on the floor, as soon as you walk in. You sure about that? I took the qualifying test a year ago, same plane. If I get on that plane, am I gonna get sick? I don't know. I have a 3-year-old daughter, okay? She depends on me. You understand? Please look at her. She's depending on you right now. Please, you gotta do something. You gotta help. Please. I'm coming with you. Me too. I left my life on that laptop. Hey, listen. I need you to help me out, okay? If you just man the floor, can you handle that? Hey, Shilah Washington. You'll recognize my bag, okay? Hurry. Ooh. This is unbelievable. Unreal. What happened? Now what? Hobbs, come in. I need my power back. Hobbs, the power's out. Come on. Oh, shit. All right, let's just keep going. Hobbs, come in. I need my power back now. Juice is out here too. Captain? Willsy? The Jetway's disabled. Captain Forrest? Willsy? Anyone? There's no one here. There's no one here. Captain? This is a mess, man. What a mess. Oh, my God. I don't understand. If - If he's not in there and everybody else split... Someone may have opened the gate. I'm gonna go check. I'm going to get my laptop. Here. Hey, there's one in here. All right. Oh, shit. It's just blood, man. Damn it. I found it. Wait, it's Doc. It's Doc. It's Doc. Doc? What? Oh, my God. See you folks at the gate. Wait. If the gate was open, they would have never left him here. Right? She's right. The gate's still locked. It's gonna be kind of tight. Hey, watch over Doc until we get back. All right. You all hurry up, okay? Yo, the name's Britz, three bags. Get your own damn bags. We're looking for a duffel, last name Washington. Hey. Hey. It broke open. Turbulence. I'm sorry. Looks like I'm out 5 bucks. Heh, heh. Here we go. What the hell are you doing? The world's a dangerous place, amigo. I never leave home without it. Besides, after what I've seen here these should be required on airplanes like seat belts. "Shilah." I got it. I got it. Come on, let's go. Oh, shit! What? What? What? A fucking rat. Shit. It came right at me. Big one, sucker, with red eyes. Are you sure it wasn't a hamster? No, it looked like a fucking rat. Come on. Let's go. Come on. Doc? Captain! Aah! No! No! No! No, captain! Get it off! Shots fired. We have shots fired. Did he get you? Look at me. Did he bite you? No, no, no! Out. Get out. Move. Move. Go. Careful. Doc? He's all right. He's alive. Okay. Pick him up. Come on, help me. Oh, shit. Okay. Shit. I got you, hold on. All right. Is he all right? He's bit. He's bit. Move. We gotta get out of here. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Check him right now. See if there are any bites on him. Really look. What the fuck was that, huh? Nothing, I don't see anything. Check everywhere. Hello? Please, help me. Shut the door! What the fuck is that? Help me with the door. Push! Push! Fucking bitch! Close the door! Take him down to tarmac level, we'll keep her out! Go! Get out of here! Hey, Jenny, we heard gunshots. Here, hold pressure on that. On her face, don't let it go. Oh, my God. What happened on the plane? They're infecting each other. I don't understand. The captain, he got it. I shot him. There's blood all over your face. We went in the plane- The bathroom's empty, it's covered in blood and the big guy's not in there anymore. We went down into the hold, you know- Hold that. Hold it. Okay. I'm here. I can't even- Move. I love you so, so much. Me too. Just hang in there. I got you. Breathe. Breathe, Paula, breathe. It's all right. We're safe. I got the gun, there's ammo in the bag. I'm glad I did because there's some crazy shit going on in there. Why'd the power go out? Um... You left this. I picked up a call from your dad. He told me to tell you to take the stick, and then all the cell phones went dead at the same time. Jenny? My dad started giving me flying lessons when I was 12. He'd say, "Take the stick." I was afraid to fly solo, even with him sitting right there next to me. One day, he let go of the stick. It went into a spin... and I had to take control. I never understood why he did that. I'm gonna be back. We got the door shut and locked. Whatever's out there in that plane stays out there. You sure about that? I didn't see Mr. Bundt around, did you? Come on. I need you. Come on. We gotta go. Let's go. Come on. What's wrong? I'm thirsty. Hey, listen up. What do you want? I got something to say. You said enough. Hey, listen to what she has to say. One, we don't know when they're getting us out. Two, we gotta make sure nobody else gets infected. Oh, smart. And who's in charge? I am. You? Oh, right. You? You know nothing. Well, I think we should vote. I got this. So shoot me or shut the fuck up. Our captain, who murdered Mrs. Stevens in 7A, is dead. Our co-pilot is creeping around the cabin like some sort of animal. That means all of you are my passengers until this flight is over. Is that clear? Yeah. I think it's pretty clear. Whatever this is, it's spreading through bites. We don't know that. Biting could be a symptom, not how it infects. Could be spread airborne, topical. We don't know. We don't know shit. If you ask me, it looks like some kind of fucked-up rabies. People rabies. People rabies? Rabies is spread through bites, right? Right? Well, mucus, saliva. There's a cure for rabies. You get shots in the stomach. That's before symptoms start. Once it manifests, it's over. There is no cure. Fuck this. I don't think this is rabies. Hm! Why not? Rabies takes weeks for the symptoms to show in humans, for the virus to travel to the brain. This takes minutes. Wait, Henry, you were watching a newsfeed on the plane. Didn't it say something about a quarantine in L. A? Yeah. An apartment building. This flight is out of L.A. Two quarantines, one night. Wonder how often that happens. What about your friend? Wouldn't you think she's infected? She's not infected. She's fine. She got bitten but hasn't had any symptoms yet. Doc! George, no! Come here. Don't touch his head! Go get your medical kit. Go get it now. Calm down. Don't let him get away. Don't let him touch you. He bit him. I see that. One, two, three. Calm down. I know why people- Go, go, go. Did it bite you? No. Are you sure? No, it's fine. Check your forearms. I am. All right. This is wrong. Inhumane. He's bitten, ma'am. It's for our own safety. All right. On three. One, two, three. You're in charge, right? You have no choice. I found something on the rat. What is it? Hold on, let me see. What is it? Look, there's a tag on the hind leg. That's a lab rat. Albino. Shit. It looks like the one in the hold. Like the other rat? Yes, and the people. So a laboratory rat is causing all this? How could a laboratory rat get into the hold of a commercial plane? I don't know. How should I know? Ask him. Who? George? Did you bring lab rats in that carrier? No. Those were my class' hamsters. When you boarded, I saw tails inside your carrier. What the hell you talking about? Okay? I had hamsters when I was little. They have little stubby things that you can barely see. Not tails. All right. Well, those hamsters were given to my class by a parent who just came back from Ecuador where I now know hamsters have tails. You just made that shit up. Hey, can I talk to you? Yeah, of course. Henry, tell me you didn't bring rats onto my plane. Jenny, listen to me. George is a little mixed up right now. He's been through a lot tonight. We all have been through a lot. Are you telling me the truth? Think about it. You can't bring lab rats on an airplane in your carry-on. It's not possible. I never would've made it through security. Of course. I'm sorry. That's okay. I'm accusing you instead of- Hey. Hey. You know- We're okay. Shit. Shit. Watch his mouth! Come here. Hold it around his neck! Get away! Hold on, Jenny, I'm coming. Help! Grab that end! Hold on, Jenny. Put it over here. Pull it. Pull! Pull! We gotta choke him. Come on! Come on. Hold him, guys! Pull! Come on. Come on. Pull! He's dead. He's dead. MAN Ramirez. Hobbs, come in. CDC's on the way. Oh, shit. CDC's coming in. Let's go. Roger that. We're all here. Hey, how you holding up? He's lying. You don't have any proof of that, George. You believe him because you like him. The ammo's in here somewhere. George. Is he all right? We'll get you out of here. I don't know. This is stupid, but have you seen my briefcase? Whoa, take it easy. Don't point the guns at us. We just wanna get out of here. Get them to the hospital. Give us your full cooperation, we'll get you out as fast as possible. Wait. Listen to me. Put down the camera. Put down the camera, sir. Put it down. Put it down. Why are you doing that? Everything will be explained. Sir, your weapon, hand it over. Nial, give him your gun. Give him the- Hey. Hey. Okay. Okay. Everybody stay calm. Easy. All right, you, you and you, over here. Get these people out. Both of them. All right, take it easy. Let's go! You and you, clear off the table. The rest of you line up here. Let's move, folks. Okay, be careful. All right. What is that? Oh, God. What is that? What are you doing? What is this? Protocol. For your safety. You've been exposed. We don't know which of you may be infected. So you've identified this. Everything will be explained. Hey, what is that? What are you giving them? Who's next? I'm not putting shit into my body unless I know what it is. Am I right? Am I right, Nial? Everything will be explained. Explain it to us now. If you want to be released, take the protocol. I'll go. State your name to the cameras. Mrs. Louise Treadwell. The cat is infected! Keep them back. Eliminate the cat. Put on your thermal headsets. Give us a heat signature. Holy shit! Shit! Let's go. Let's go! Where are you going? Open up, we got injured. Open the fucking doors! Let us out! Everybody move. Let's go. Come on. We gotta follow these guys out. Shit. Get away from the door. Move away from the door. Got a live one in here. Come here! Pull him in. Come on. Come on, man. Okay, close the door. Quick. GSW, left eye. Shit. George, get my field kit. They shot him in the leg. Can you help him? I hear them. They're coming from the plane. Everybody move. We gotta go. Get out of here! Let's go, let's go. We gotta go. Move, lady. Come on. Move. Let's go. Let's go. Where are we going?! Go to the catering truck. Everybody go to the catering truck. This way. Come on. Move. Everybody in. Let's go. Come on, come on. Move, move, move. Get in here, quick. Come on, let's go. Put them in there. Come on. Get in the truck. What are you doing? Your face. Get in the truck, lady. Get in the truck! Let's go! What are you doing? I love you. Get in the truck. Come on. No. He's infected. He's infected. Let him go. Let him go! He'll kill you. I can't. Come on. Paula, I left her out there. We gotta go get her. If your friend is up and about, you do not wanna look for her. You don't understand. She took the protocol, she's gonna be okay- No, honey, there is no protocol. I still don't understand. Maybe I've been in the Army too long, but we were each getting a different set of injections, medications. What makes you think that? Hello? Each cartridge had its own color, its own label. That true? I'm not authorized to discuss it. I'll authorize you. What is going on here? What does the CDC know? It's not CDC. It's CBDT. Chemical Biological Domestic Terrorism. Terrorism? What? Homeland Security. An apartment building in L.A. Is under quarantine. One of our units went in a couple of hours ago, nobody ever came out. They found a bio-terror laboratory in an attic apartment. Some kind of doomsday cult. Hold on a second. Wait, somebody made this? Made the virus. And they were looking for a cure, an antidote. They ran a clinical trial in that lab, on humans. We found a test subject, a survivor, if you can call him that. Whatever they were given... was making it worse, much worse. Were there rats in that lab? Rats are the carriers. We thought we caught a break stopping your flight. Our orders were to try everything to keep you alive and contained. You don't know what the fuck this really is or how to treat it. If what I've seen in here spreads out into the general population and we have no clue how to deal with this-- So we're the fucking lab rats now? National security. They're never gonna let us out of here now, are they? Hey, hey, hey. Don't. Put it down. Easy. Just put the gun down. Whoa, whoa, whoa. What do you think? No! There's no way out of here. We are going to die. That's not true. We're gonna find a way out- Don't say that. Stop lying. There's no way out of here. Don't give up. There's a way out. We will find a way. No, there's not. There's always a way. We're gonna stay in here all night until the people get us. Shut up. Shut up. The rain. What? The rain. This terminal, it floods when it rains bad. They said there's a service tunnel somewhere that never got sealed up. A tunnel? Are you kidding me? Where Terminal F was gonna go. Never got built. Airport Authority ran out of cash. Where is it? I don't know, but I know how to find it. Oh, my God! Shoot it! Shoot it! Get the gun! Shoot that motherfucker! Shoot it! Shoot him! Shoot him! Shoot the motherfucker! There are no bullets! Shoot him! Shoot him! George! Press the green button! Okay, okay, okay. Oh, my God! Follow me. Shh. Hey, quiet. Come on, let's go. We gotta get to the office. Find that tunnel to Terminal F. Hey, hey. Hold on. Hold on. Where's Henry? Where's Henry? We gotta keep moving. Come on. They got her. They got her. Let's go! Move. Move. Go, go, George, go! Run! Move, they're here. Let's go. Come on. Don't stop. Let's go, let's go. Come on. What was that? Henry. What was that, Jenny? Move, move, move. Let's go. Come on. Keep moving. Keep moving. Keep moving. Jenny. Jenny, get up. Jenny. She's infected. Oh, shit. Paula. Paula, stay back. Go! Give me the wrench. Jenny! Jenny! Come on. Come on. Let's go. Come on, I got you. Let's go, kid. Here we go. All right. Go. Right there. Come on. Go, go. Get in. Get in. Okay. Find anything that says Terminal F, okay? Check all the blueprints. Go. Where? Where do we look? In the corner. Check the corner. It should say right here. Check the corners. F, F, F. George, what are you doing? You stole this from Henry? Look at these. What are you doing? Found it. Terminal F schematic design. Bring it over. All right. Okay. Okay, okay. Where are we? Terminal F. Good. Yeah, that's it. Okay, okay, this is it. We're right here. Looks like the tunnel's entrance is in a shaft. Right behind the crew-break area. How do we get to it? Okay, we go through the work bay to tarmac level. We gotta get through that wall, into that wall space. Once we're here, all we gotta do is walk the service tunnel and we'll make it to Terminal F. We'll be fine. Go! They got you. That's a bite. Yeah. But you'll be okay, right? Because you have this? I found it hidden in his briefcase. Bring it to me. That's the antidote, right? That you were testing in L.A. In that apartment building? Come on, hand it over. Who the hell are you? I told you before on the plane, I'm one of the good guys willing to do something, take responsibility for the future. By starting a fucking plague. Nobody else is doing anything. Are you? How many people were you planning to kill? As many as it takes. So you decide who lives? No, we do. Because the alternative is that no one lives. Our population keeps growing and consuming while our planet is dying. Don't make me shoot her, George. Bring it here. No! Ed! Ed! Against the wall! Against the wall! Okay. All right. Against the wall! Against the wall! All right. How'd you get that through security? The same way I got the rats through. Same way I found out my lab in Los Angeles was compromised. I had to take my toys and leave town. Friends of the cause. Same ones who arranged for my arrival in Kansas City and the ones who will help me once I get out of here. Antibodies need the virus to kick in. Fight the infection, keep it from damaging the brain. What is that? You're a smart kid. Maybe smart enough to be one of us someday. Go to hell. Don't buy in to all that big government bullshit. They label people like us "extremists," "doomsday cults," "terrorists," because that's easier than telling you the truth. What is the truth, Henry, huh? Earth could use a good plague. Move and I'll kill you. Oh, amazing. I can't feel a thing. Sure it works? Ran the trials myself in L.A. I heard that didn't go so well. Shut up! Time to go, George. Don't touch him. Hey, let him go. This is his only chance. Come on. Move it! Jenny. Come on, Jenny. Come on. Okay. Come on. We have to go after them. Come on, let's go. Come on, Jenny, go. Go. I'm gonna catch up. Take this. I'll go first. I'll get him. Hurry. Okay. All right? No. Let me go. George? Oh, shit. Shit! Oh, God. Oh, God. Shit. Come on! Come on! Die, you fucking shit! It's me. Shilah? Shilah? What is that? Thermal vision. CDC left it behind. You see them before they see you. George and Henry, they went in there, into the wall. Why didn't you follow them? Here. Just not my day to fly. You get George, you kill that rat, and you get out. Shilah. Shilah. I'm gonna try to buy you some time. Shilah. Hey, Flight 318! I'm over here, motherfuckers! Oh, shit. Shoot. Mice. Mice. Just mice. George? Jenny? Hold on, George. I'm coming down. No. Henry- It didn't work. Don't come down here. There's a flashlight and a gun by your feet. I can't see them. I'm coming down. Stay up there. Stay there, George. No. Go back, please. No. Jenny, please don't. Please go back up. Please, please. Stay up there, please. Please, go back, Jenny. Don't come down here, please. Please. Run, George! Run! Run! Run! Hey, you. Did you get him? Jenny. Look. Where is he? Look. Henry. Come on. Are you okay? Are you okay? Did he get you? No. Did he bite you? What happened? When we climbed out, he tried to bite me. The terminal. They're burning it down. Come on. Hold it there. It's the tunnel to Terminal F. It's welded shut. There's no way out, Jenny. Stay there. Come on. It's locked. We're not gonna get out. It's rusted. I'll get it open. I just wanna go home. Step back. Step back. Come on. We gotta go. I'm not going in there. Listen to me. Listen to me. We have no choice. I gotta get you in there, okay? Trust me. I can't go in there. Come on, we gotta go. No way. Listen, George. We don't have any other choice, all right? Look, look. Be my eyes, okay? You tell me what you see. Ready? Go. I don't see anything. It's just a baggage tunnel. I'm right behind you. Promise? I promise. Go. Go. Keep going. George, don't slow down. Keep going. Keep going, George. Don't stop. Go, go. Go, George, go. Hurry. Why'd you stop? Keep going. Don't stop. Jenny. I'm infected, George. Keep going. No, you're not. It's happening so fa-- I'm sorry. I can feel it. I don't have much time. You'll be okay. Go, please. You're fine. Leave me. I'm not going without you. Leave me! You won't hurt me. I'm not going without you. Okay? Okay. Jenny, I think I see-- Jenny, we made it. Jenny. Jenny? Get out here! I'm not leaving without you.
