From Mehmed's Book As with all great tales, we shall also start this with the name of the Creator. I'll say once upon a time, you can say now... ...or a time which seemed like yesterday. I'll say a village; you can say it's this village... ...a neighboring village, or one further away. It was a village like any village. A corner of this land... it was this land itself. Before dawn, before anyone was yet awake... ...a stranger came out of nowhere to this village from far, far away. Our hero's name was Abraham. He was a Messenger, going from town to town. Abraham was scared... Very scared. It was such a fear that it had stolen his mind... ...stolen his very mind and caused him to go insane. Whatever happened, whoever did this to him, had caused him to lose his voice. The light had gone out of his eyes. What he saw, he saw differently, and what he heard, he heard differently. What happened to him? Please tell us. Patience my dear. I will get to that! Thank you, thank you all. Enough, enough... - Here Mister. - Take this as well, Mister. Do not give what will be missed at home. - Thank you, that is enough for me. - Take this. No, no thank you. Here let me pack your satchel. - Keep one for yourself. One is enough. - Mister, can't you stay? I must go... The road awaits me. Let the road wait... Don't go. Stay with us. We can look after you. You don't have a home. Let our home be yours. - Did you enjoy this tale? - Yes, I did. I liked the tale and you. Then you must let me go. Other children will also listen to the tale... ...and learn about Messenger Abraham's story. ...just like you. Would you have me not tell them? For without telling my tale, what would I do, my child? - Farewell. - Farewell. Farewell. May you go in peace. And she is supposed to be a mother. She is not even ashamed. They said it was a lie... I know it is not a lie. And that bitch is supposed to be a mother. Damn her mothering. - Good day to all. - Good day to you. - Could I trouble you for a cup of coffee? - It is no trouble. Esma, open the door! Esma! May your mind be open to what you read my son. Thank you mister. My son... Knows how to read and write. I am going to sit here till you open this door. At first, we wanted him to learn to read so he could take care of the coffeehouse. But instead, he became a scholar. He reads all day long as if it's worth something. Let him read. Is there anything better than reading? Omar, get up and sweep the floor. God damn sissy boy! You get back to your work. With your permission I would like to speak to your son a little. What for? Where do you come from? Who are you? I'm a wanderer. - I wander. - That is all we needed... He has work to do, talk to him later. Are there any children in this village? Of course there are, who has ever heard of a village... ...without children? - Don't work too hard, girl. Hey you good for nothings, anything new today? Hseyin, look you've peed over here. Did grandmother Hate forget to diaper you again? Or is it that your cock is so big that the diaper was not big enough. Let me look... Man, it's alive... It bit me! May God forgive you. - Brother Dursun. - Yes? - A pipe and coffee... right now. - Right away. - Omar! A pipe and make it quick. - Don't be sad. Even if tongues stay silent, the hearts still have a hundred ways of speaking. Get lost and do not ever come to my door again. May that girl's sins rest upon your head. You are supposed to be her mother. You liar whore. Neighbors, friends help me! She is bringing my house down upon me. May the house come down upon your head. You deserve to rot in a dungeon. People, is that not the truth? Don't you all know what's going on here? What are you all afraid of? Why are you all silent? This girl's sins lay upon this whole village. All who know, but do not tell, will burn in hell. This bitch is lying. She is making false accusations just to get my daughter into her own house. Don't you know how jealous she is? She is jealous of all our children. Mister, please don't. Somehow they will blame you. Her infertility has caused her all these problems. She's jealous of all of us. Sisters, send your men to her just once for heaven's sake... ...and let them put out this whore's fire. A mother, that's what I am. Not infertile like you. Childless Mary, infertile Mary. - Fight! - Hit her! - Girl, get back inside. - Same old thing everyday! Without this, what would we do for entertainment? You asked for it yourself Mary. What are you looking at? Is my cock hanging out in the open? Get up my sister. Are you all right? Thank you mister. Esma, the ship is in, be ready for tonight. Be there before it is evening. All right. Be still, girl. Tell me, what happened to you? What has made your face so sad? - Because of Sister Mary. - What's the reason? I couldn't hear you. It's because of Mary, because Esma kicked her. Do you think her stomach hurt? - I hope she dies. - No, do not say that. - It is not right to curse anyone. - David... I'm racing my horse. Come on! I don't care; she should not have hit her. And no one stopped them... again. They do not like Sister Mary, that's why. They call her crazy. She's not crazy. She always gives us candy, dried fruit and berries. Would you like me to tell you all a tale? Would you like that? - Why? What for? - Because I don't have any candy. ...or dried fruit and so you will feel better, what do you say? - What kind of tale is it? - Sit down and listen, then you will see. And all of you... Go gather your friends. Mary caused quite a scene again this morning. What is this? It is a storyteller? Saffet! David's Beginning. This is such a tale, that it requires the storyteller as well as... ...the listener to do a lot of work. The listener will tire as much as the teller. Do you know why? Because, you have to imagine the faces of all the people in this tale in your minds. How are we going to do that? For example, if I say there is an old lady in this tale... imagine her face in your mind. Have all those characters act... ...and move about in your imagination. Like shadow puppets. These can be faces of people you know, it is not possible for them... ...to be the characters, but let us pretend. Place a person from this village in the role of each character... ...make sure you have picked someone. For the good characters, pick good people. But, forget about the bad man, let his be a dark, blank face. There is a character. The Messenger Abraham in this tale. Leave his face to me; I am the only one that will see his face. That is the puzzle of this tale. Agreed? As with all great tales, we start this one with the name of the Creator as well. Once upon a time, I will say a hundred years ago, you can say today. There was a Messenger Abraham. No, David, what did we say? Keep the Messenger's face blank in your mind. You are going to put faces on all the other characters. Do you know what a Messenger is? He is a man who delivers one's news... ...one's message or one's wish to another on horseback. Well, it was a day... Just like today. It was a chestnut horse, it could carry the whole world on its back... all day and all night, never tiring. The road was long, the road never ended... but Abraham's water ran out. He found a well near the side of the road. And whatever happened, happened just at that very moment. When Abraham drank the water... He cried and fell on the floor. All of a sudden a vision appeared before his very eyes. An old woman. My God... What happened to that poor man? mm, Yunus hurry on over. There is someone out here. - What is happening? - Yunus, who is it? - Run, hurry. - What happened to the poor thing? - Turn him over. - What happened Grandmother? Who is it? Whatever happened to you son, do tell. No, no don't be afraid... Hurry up and bring some water. - Hurry, run. - Run... Run. Early in the morning, before the rooster crowed, I got up. There was a loud noise. I saw this man in front of the door. He had fallen to the ground. His nose and mouth was all in slobber. He couldn't speak... He was feverish, the poor thing, he was burning up. Does anybody recognize him? Know where he is from? Grandmother, you're touching him but are you sure he is not rabid or anything? Let's get rid of him Grandmother. Let's throw him into the river. He will spread his poison to us. Don't talk crazy. He is not going to bite me. And if he is going to poison anyone, let it be me. The poor soul. What are we going to do? Throw him out? Son, can you speak? Please try... Open your eyes. What is going on here? This kind old man is telling us a tale. Ferhat, get your lazy ass home. Your mother needs you. - Brother Adam? Are we going? - I'm coming. I wonder who he is? What is he telling the children? - I hope he is not trouble. - I don't know either. ...but he seems like a good man. A poor wanderer probably. When the man roared "What's going on here?"... Everyone cowered down in front of him. He was an evil man. He had left no evil undone upon the villagers. He only thought of himself, causing harm to everyone around him. No one liked this man, and do you know why? - Is it because he did bad things? - No. They didn't like him... ...because they feared him. Evil acts can be forgiven. Man, and even God can forgive the bad... ...but people really hate what they only fear. Angela! Where have you been, girl? Where's the water? Hurry up and go get the water. Don't you have anything else to do, you've gathered all the children around you. All the chores are left undone in our homes because of you. Is that little girl the only one taking care of your house? It seems so; her hands are covered in open sores. - She is very sick. She keeps coughing. - What's it to you? - Why don't you mind your own business? - My own business? - Cemile! - What? Cemile, don't worry yourself, girl. I'm going to go into town... ...and get some officials and have them all thrown out of our village. Enough already, as if one crazy wasn't enough, now we have two. Sister Esma, don't be rude. Be on your way. Get lost, I'm not going to learn my manners from you... Come on girl, get going. Children, you can listen to the rest of the tale tomorrow. I will let you all know when. You all get on home now. Yes, we shall leave the rest for tomorrow. Mister, my father has gone home to sleep. He left the coffeehouse to me. Have a cup of my coffee and we can chat a little? Mister, I won't ask you where you are coming from, or where you are going to. I am sure that you have been asked that question a lot. But, I am going to tell you this. If you are a wanderer, a traveler... ...you are in the wrong place... The wrong village. Why is that? This village is not like other villages, Mister. It's obvious that you have seen a lot, you are a well read... ...learned man. They will not understand you here. This village... It's as if this village has taken upon itself all the sins of the world... Lots of things go on here. You wouldn't know. You seem to be a good man; do not stay here... Keep on going. No, I cannot go, if I go the tale will be left untold. Why must you tell it? Because, I have nothing else to do. What am I without my words? But you said "Even if tongues stay silent... ...the hearts still have a hundred ways of speaking. " - The books I read say the same thing. - That is true. ...but my tale is not the kind you can be silent about. It must be told... This tale must be told. Must be told so that my heart can stop its burning. You won't be telling me to be quiet, you would be telling me to die, young man. Do you love that girl? My father doesn't want her. No one does. Because she has a bad reputation. Before me, she was seeing a fellow from the neighboring village. When he married another, Emine's name has gone bad. Her father was going to kill her, but I stopped him. Her mother and father have moved away. Mary took Emine in to live with her. They were going to kill her but I stopped them. - Still, it seems, you don't love her enough. - What more can I do Mister... What are you waiting for? Go get her and run away together. There are thousands of places for two people to live... If you wanted. Tell me the end of the tale... What happens to the Messenger? Send a message secretly to all children. Bring them when everyone is asleep. I saw an empty barn down the road. I will wait for all of you there. - You can all find out the end of the tale. - Mister, you are playing with fire. The fires you know cannot burn the likes of me. - The end will be disaster. - Imagine the worst catastrophe... - You can think of. I have lived it, Omer. - Don't... You are scaring me. If you fear, then you can never know the ending. And what you do not know the ending of you will fear forever. Once all has gone to asleep... at the empty barn down past the cemetery. Come on, come in Esma. - I am not coming in, I will wait outside. - Why don't you come in and have a drink? - It will be rude to the men. - No. No need, I drank a lot with them in the past. You never drank with these men. You must have... ...drunk with their fathers and grandfathers. Do not be foolish and do not waste my time. Look, you are not going to make her dance, are you? She does not know how to dance. And you said two men... No more than that... She has a life, too. Do not forget. Ok sister, leave all that to me. Two of them prefer boys anyway. And we cannot stay too late. They are already gossiping in the village. I'm waiting for you here daughter. Selman will bring you right back. Don't be scared. Hey men! This stuff is of the highest quality. Has Mahmut ever seen such a good one before? The stuff is good, master, but uncle Mahmut gave us money for only one sack. What? Are we going to sell this in small batches. It's taking all I have to... ...grow this stuff in secret. Pack it up... We are not selling. Send my regards to Mahmut and tell him the crop is plenty. Have him come himself instead of sending you. I come here in person despite my position. Who does he think he is? Tell him I'm not selling it to you. He needs to come himself. Send my regards. Tell him not to send some snot nosed kid... ...with his petty pocket money to do important business. Whoa... Stop it. Stop. David... David come here... Come on. David, I am going to tell you something, but it is a secret. Swear on your mother's grave. No one but the children will know about this. - Don't go telling Ferhat anything either. - I won't tell. When all the creatures sleep... Meet in the old barn... When they all drift away... The secret we shall keep. When all the creatures sleep... Meet in the old barn... When they all drift away... The secret we shall keep. When all the creatures sleep... Meet in the old barn... When they all drift away... The secret we shall keep. - Mary? Aren't you going to eat? - You eat, I don't feel like it. I will sit next to you and keep you company. We drank some sherbet earlier; that must have filled me up. You are talking a lot, but I know where your mind is. - Where do you think my mind is? - It is wandering in storyland. Girl, I have a good mind to hit you. You are talking about that man, aren't you? Have you gone crazy, like I don't have anything better to do or think about. Well, you don't, so just let your mind keep wandering. Girl, don't make fun of me. - As if thinking worths something! - It does not, does it? No, I did not say that because of you. I was just thinking to myself. I was just wondering if the poor man had anything to eat... - He has no home, no people. - Okey. Take him some food then... ...as a good deed. - Ok, let me take him something then. So, you think you are so clever, don't you? - Well then, tell me where he is? - I don't know. Ask Omar, he should know. - What did that man tell you today? - Nothing, just a tale... A tale about a hero and a tale about a warrior. Good, good. - Who goes there? - It is me. - Do you remember me? - Of course I do. - I am Mary... My name I mean. - Welcome. I thought I would bring you some food. You went to a lot of trouble. It was no trouble. You have to eat. Please... eat. - Here. - Thank you... ...may your table always be plentiful. I wanted to thank you, too. You helped me out a lot today. You should spread this... It is not right to eat on the ground. No, it is better this way. I should not get used to being comfortable. - Why not? - Because I am a wanderer... I must not get used to it. You mean if you get used to it, you would be afraid to stay. Right? Thank you, it is delicious. I am glad you like it. - Are you not going to eat? - No... Just give me something to drink. What the hell are you looking at? Get the fuck out of here... ...before I take my anger out on you. Are you getting wise with me? You little shit... What do you think you are doing? Is this what you want? Is this what you want? Don't look at me... Don't look at me... You little sissy. I can't believe you are my son. Everything I do goes wrong because of you. Get lost. - Stop. Leave it. - Thank you. - You are a different kind of man. - Different? How? I do not know. I never saw a man clear the table before. - Did I say something wrong? - I am used to doing everything myself. - Since when? - For a long time... A very long time. What if I don't ask, and you just tell me about it? I do not want to talk right now. I am trying to keep my strength up for later. I am going to tell the children a tale tonight. Ok, then... I will get going. Later tonight... Why don't you come with the children? Do not say anything to anyone. No one knows other than the children. Are we going to go sister? What if they wake up and they don't see us in bed? Come on, come on. Those who missed the beginning of the tale are all caught up now... Everyone knows what has happened till now... Tell me where we left off this morning. - So, tell me... - We left off at Grandmother Rabia's house. She was taking care of the Messenger. Then, that bad man came and yelled out "What is going on here?" Good for you, you have all paid attention. Such as it was, everyone looked at the man in fear. Mister, you never told us that man's name? Who is he? Let us not name him, ok? I do not want you to imagine a familiar face for him... ...it would not be right because then. ...the sin would be on me. Imagine a face you do not know for this man. Place his face in darkness and... ...give him a name. Let it always remain dark. ...let his face always remain dark. So, it was just this man that yelled out... "What is going on here, why have you all gathered?" What is going on here? Why have you all gathered? "Ferhat's Dream" - There is someone at Grandmother's house. We don't know if he is sick or rabid. Yunus, you and Halil should go in town and get the doctor. Look, this poor man cannot even open his eyes. My sympathies Grandmother Rabia. - Bring me some water. - What is it for? If he is rabid, he will not drink, he will be afraid of it. Then I will take care of him, myself. What kind of thing is that to say? Will you kill him if he is rabid? Well, what are we supposed to do? I won't let anyone touch him before the doctor comes. Taking a man's life is such a sin that it would make the whole world tremble. No! Abraham's eyes were burning like fire. The other man, the tyrant couldn't breathe. At that very moment, God gave the Messenger Abraham, the strength of a warrior. Abraham seized the tyrant by the throat and as he squeezed. He looked straight into his eyes and said... I know all, I know everything. I know the book. I am his voice, his words. There is another man inside me named Mehmed. The moment I drank from the well... ...his soul, his spirit and his mind entered me. Everyone will know what you did to Mehmed. They will know about the others as well. Their blood will not be spilled in vain. Who the hell is this crazy man? What is this nonsense he is saying? Mehmed? Mehmed who? What is he saying? Everyone was looking at this tyrant and his men... ...as if they had understood what was happening. He is speaking nonsense because of his fever. Can you not see? They were afraid. They all ran away... These men, who had pretended to be the bravest of all men... ...suddenly became cowards when they were told of their sins. - What were their sins, what did they do? - I will get to that young man... Be patient. Five people were missing from the village. ...six with Mehmed, one of them was a girl. These are what they looked like... Mehmed is the first one. You will all see. Sit down and... ...pass it around without fighting. Before the Messenger came, no one knew what had happened to them... They say, no sin stays hidden forever. And this one did not either. Keep a lookout; make sure no one is around to see. Where is he? It was as if God had given the Messenger... - Where is that lunatic? ... the intuition to see into the future. He knew that danger was near, and knowing so, he disappeared. It was just at that moment that this tyrant felt what real fear was. Where are you? Come out... Come out! I know all... I know everything. - Get inside! - Where is that voice coming from? - What voice? - Can you not hear it? - I know all... I know everything. - The voice... It is gnawing at my brain... Where, where is it coming from? Go! Go and find him! Night became day but, the Messenger was nowhere to be found. It was as if he had vanished. Mehmed was an innocent man, a poor and good man. I have come to avenge his death. His, and the deaths of... ...the other five, said the Messenger. The man's legs were shaking, he was so scared. The Messenger actually knew everything. Our ancestors say that no sin stays hidden forever. When the time comes, even the plants in the ground become witnesses... ...and reveal the truth. The rest of the murderers found themselves at... ...the gravesite of the other five who had been killed. The gravesite was a big hole in the ground that no one knew about. Everyone had returned to the spot where they had committed the big sin. Ikram, why did we come here? I'm scared... Let us leave. It hasn't been touched... How did that asshole know? You are the ones who killed us. Our sins are upon your heads. Our graves are not claimed... They are unattended and we have no one to pray for us. How can one man do this to another man? May God forgive us... May God forgive... They, who had never spoken God's name before... ...now in fear of death, spoken it for the first time. But no one could save them. Even the earth showed its power and covered them under. And it was at that moment that the men understood what death meant... What it meant to murder... What it meant to lie under the earth. I killed you. Didn't you die? Your father buried you here, you son of a bitch... Are you a ghost? Come! - Drink... Drink! - No, no, no! He held him under water till he was out of breath... He wanted him to drink the water from the well. The mightiest of all men, the Messenger let the man live... But it was futile. If you ask why... When the man drank the water, Mehmed's soul... ...thoughts and mind entered him as well. The next morning the sun rose... But he awoke blinded. No! They say that only an oiled rope could ease his pain... They say that he killed himself early that morning. They say... The words he wrote on the wall said... The Messenger showed me the darkness of my heart. The darkness I saw there blinded my eyes. It is only God's right to give life or take it. What can you do? Man has done evil upon man. I do not deserve to go on living... May God forgive me in hell fire. It is not known if death is an escape for the dead. But the villagers thought they had escaped. They thought they could now live in peace. No one shed any tears for the man they had cowered in front of... Men always respect tyrants when they are alive... But never pray for them when they are dead... They spit on their graves. The Creator of Earth and the skies... You are in my heart and soul. Come, come... May God forgive... The villagers all thought themselves to be innocent. ...but as day turned into night, they found out they were wrong... That night something happened, something unbelievable. Those who knew and stayed silent are as guilty as the ones who sinned. You did not see, hear or speak. What is a man, without his words? We are there, right over there... Lying in the ground. Our grave is a bottomless pit. There is no one praying for us. Those who knew and stayed silent are just... ...as pitiless as the ones who have committed this sin. A heavy and heartless shame had covered the entire village. They were all ashamed of themselves. The sun never shined in that village again. Even the roosters stopped their crowing. Spring never came and... ...no plant ever grew. No lamb or sheep bleated ever again. All that was left was a crazy wind... ...drying every hand, every lip it touched in its path. A crazy wind was all that was left. The wind was like a naughty child as it blew upon this dry land. The whole village had turned into a silent graveyard. Only this crazy wind was left blowing upon the sealed lips of the living dead. No one saw the Messenger again. They said that the Messenger Abraham had disappeared, had vanished. All that was left was a crazy wind and that wind whispered the Messenger's name. It said, "Don't forget... You mustn't forget... " You haven't told us why those men killed Mehmed and the other five. - Come on tell us. - Be patient son, I am going to tell you. But this is enough for tonight. You all go on home and sleep now, and do not tell anyone anything. Tomorrow night come again at the same time. Omar, take the children home quietly. - Why don't you just finish the tale now? - Omer... Mary... I told the children to come back, but... When they come, you should too tomorrow night. I will be here. Angela! Get up. What is this sleep? Have you died? Saffet, come on wake up... You little shit, get up and take the animals out to feed. Have you been smoking weed? Sleeping till this hour? Why didn't you wake him up? The sheep are going to starve to death. How should I know he wasn't up? He gets up by himself every morning. Ferhat! The Messenger will come... He will show you how dark your heart is. He will blind you. Just wait... Just you wait. The Messenger Abraham will come for you. Adem, don't! Has anyone ever died of hunger? We can take care of each other. What do you want from that girl? They lie. What have I ever done to her? Please don't Esma. Don't lie. Everyone knows what you are doing. Please forget about selling your daughter. - What? Are we supposed to starve to death? - No one will starve here. Don't fear. They said that to me too in the past. Everyone here is all mouth when it comes to giving advise. They knocked me up with Eve. If it is a sin, it's their's to bear. She will be like me. It's our fate. We don't know of anything else and we cannot change it. It's fortunate that Eve is not aware of what is going on. I was only fifteen when I was thrown onto uncle Osman's lap. At least she isn't aware. What about me? What should I have done? She is not aware, huh? Even if the tongues stay silent... ...the hearts still have a hundred ways of speaking says that man. Your daughter is screaming for help everyday. Turn and look at her face. See how she looks at you? Then you will understand everything. You just say fate and hope for the best. Blaming fate is the easy way out. If you are done, be off... and don't ever come back again. And you know keeping her chained up? At least don't do that. Is she an animal? If she goes off to the well? You want her to fall in? I know that nothing can wash away your pain. But I promise you that before this flower dries out. I will save you. I promise. I have to go somewhere, father. I have something to do. Where the hell are you going? What do you have to do? The tea is on. I've swept your coffeehouse and I've washed the dishes from yesterday. I am 21 years old and I have done everything you have told me... ...to do every single day for 21 years. ...if you ever treat me like a child again... ...if you ever interfere with the books I read... ...if you ever lift your hand at me again, it will be the last time you do it. Sit... Sit down and eat your bread. Emine! Hush, don't say anything. I... I'm in love with you. Whatever has happened has happened... I don't care. I love you Emine. I will come come for you and we will run away together. ...if you also love me Emine. You must know that... I am waiting for the right moment. And when that moment comes... And if you also want me Emine. This mark is my promise to you. If this mark gathers dust while you are still in this house... ...then you can come and break this flowerpot over my head. Mister... Mister... Come out. Mister... Send word to the Messenger. Have him come straight away. I've had enough. Enough! Send word to the Messenger; tell him "Ferhat is waiting for you!". My child. What happened to you? Who did this to you? It is all right... You just send word to the Messenger. Have him come. - Dursun, a pipe and a coffee... Now. - Right away. - A good day to you sister. - Yes? I have a request. Could you grind these up and have your daughter eat them? Why would I do that? She keeps coughing, her lungs have caught a cold. These will do her good. They were in my sack for a long time. I gathered them in some fields. They are medicinal. - For Angela? - Yes, for her. How should I know that these are good? How do you know? In the past... I was a doctor... I know herbs and roots well. Give this to her once in the morning and once at night. Crush them up and add a spoon of honey if you have some. - Should we crush them up mother? - Wait girl. That man is crazy. How do we know they are not poisonous? We will ask your father when he comes tonight. How does this man know you've been coughing? I don't know... Remember he saw me yesterday? - You were also there. - Yes. Omar, a linden tea please, if it is no trouble. There is none left. Actually there is, but none for you. What?! Is there something you want to say? It is the man's coffeehouse, he doesn't have to serve you. This village is ours... If we want... This is also my coffeehouse! The village is everybody's village... - All of God's men are! - Look! Look at who is talking... ...welcome here. - Look, how does he speak! What the hell has happened to all of you this morning. This man is messing with their minds brother Dursun. He keeps telling them tales. My son talked back to me this morning. Supposedly someone is coming to kill us all. What the hell are you telling these people? Forget about what I am telling them. Your son's nose was bleeding this morning? Did you see it?! If it bleeds, it bleeds. So what? What's it to you? He's just a kid. That is right. He's just a child. He can't stand up for himself. Right? - Brother Adam sit... That is enough. - Shut your mouth. What are you telling them? Are you a godless spy? A pagan? A bandit? Tell me. What are you? You wouldn't understand what I've been telling them. And where did you see my son anyway? Why didn't we think of this before? Are you touching those children? Enough! Enough already... You godless idiots! Come on... Come if you are men! This isn't like you. This doesn't become you. Is it right for them? All these years, was it right for them? Give thanks that you are brother Dursun's son. Or else you would be dead! - I would have killed you. - You can't do shit, come on! Come! Fuck off! I'm here... An eye for an eye, tooth for a tooth. You see... You have feared... ...these spineless creeps all these years. Now look at them! Those who knew and were silent are also guilty, like you. Like you all. If anything happens to Omar, it's your fault. Leave this village! I'm begging you mister, please go away. He is a crazy man, telling our children stories. He is a warlock. Sent by infidels. He goes from village to village... ...to spy and split up our homes. He has gone to other villages as well... Has left no evil undone. - He is an evil... - He says he is a doctor... - His lies are ready. - A warlock... - To split up our people. - He gave Cemile some weeds to brew... ...for Angela. - She threw him out. Really? He gave it to children, too. When they were asleep he'd touch them. May he drop dead. He'd touched them all over. Can I come in? Don't pay them no mind, this is nothing new. Things like this always happen here. There is always a fight going on. They yell and scream for an hour or so. Then, they all go home and forget. - I did not want this to happen. - You didn't ask for this. They always look for a reason to fight. This would have happened anyway. Even if you hadn't come... ...they would have found a reason to go at each other's throats. Omar is outside... He wants to apologize to you, but he is hesitant... Should he come in? Omar. It is okay, it is okay. Are you leaving? You've gathered all your stuff. - I thought it would be for the best. - Why Mister? Is it right for you... ...to leave because of a few idiots? And before you finish the tale? Where is the courage you've been telling us about? I told you from the start... Work falls upon the listener... ...as much as it does on the storyteller. Some tales scare people, even large crowds. Then you must tell it mister. You're the one who taught us not to fear... ...what we know the beginning and ending of. Tell it, so we know the ending and we fear no longer. Not for us... For the children? You had them memorize the Messenger's tale... Now do you say it was a lie? Are you feeling better? Are we going to listen to the tale? You go, even if I cannot. You can tell me the ending. I wish mom would go to bed. Hold on, I will get her to go. - Mother... Mother... - Yes... Yes sweetheart? I'm a bit better. Why don't you go to bed now? Okay... I'll go to bed then. - Has father gone to sleep? - Yes, he's already asleep. Don't worry, I'll memorize the ending and I will tell you in exactly the same way. Enough already, let's go to bed... They said the man has gone... - Don't get angry. - Who said he has gone? Mary said so. She said, "Are you all satisfied?" "He left because of all of you. " And you believed her? That lying bitch... They're hiding him. They'll bring down our homes, you'll see. I should go to the authorities and get him thrown in jail. Hold on, let me think a little. - Where is that man? Tell me. - I said I don't know... - You've asked me a thousand times. - Let him go. He says he doesn't know. - Where are you going at this hour? - What the fuck is it to you? Yesterday you asked why they killed Mehmed... Tonight I'm going to tell you. Then at the end, I will ask you my question... Okay? - Is it hard to know the answer? - No. It's not, because there is notjust one answer. However many there are of you here, that's how many answers there are. Ikram! Lkram! - Brother Adam... What is happening? - Are you sleeping? Yes. - Great! - Go inside woman. I should go to sleep, too then. Let's all sleep... ...they'll fuck us and we won't even know. - What do you want me to do? - Get us something to drink... ...we need to talk. I'm waiting. Go. Now, it is time for Mehmed's part of the tale... It's about Mehmed and his five friends' secret. Actually, this tale started long... ...before the part where I began. There was a young man named Mehmed who lived in a village. If you're wondering why I saved the beginning of the tale till the end... Well... That's the kind of storyteller I am. I kept the hardest part till the end. We're going to get this job done quietly. I know that whore Mary is hiding him in her house. Let's keep watch around here. He eventually has to go to the outhouse... ...or come out sometime. And if he doesn't come out, we'll go in quietly while they're sleeping. Ever since Mehmed was a little boy, his favorite thing was to read and write. He wanted to learn and memorize everything about nature and humanity. If you ask why... Well... First, his father encouraged him... And... And, also because he could do nothing else. He couldn't run or play likes his friends. He had to spend his whole day on a chair... That's why. Why? From birth... They call it polio. Do you know what it is? His father was a doctor, but even he couldn't find a cure. "Doctor's Gospel" But he never gave up, he dedicated his life to this cause. So, this wouldn't happen to other children. Time passed and Mehmed grew. His mother died. It was just him and his father left in the house. The doctor worked hard to find a cure. He worked all day and night, but it was hopeless. Just one of those nights, when he had fallen asleep, something happened. Maybe it was because of the sleepless nights. Maybe, his mind was playing tricks on him... Maybe, there was no light, no wind. But, something happened to Mehmed that night. Something unexplainable. After that night, Mehmed started to write a book and he started writing very quickly. When the book was finished, Mehmed asked his father... ...for six trustworthy people who could read, write and keep a secret. They were to make copies of the book. And whatever happened happened then. It is as if the book was magical. It gave the reader courage... ...to speak the truth without fear... ...and erased all the fears in their heart. It changed whoever, that read it, into someone completely different. But, there was one who left the book half finished, fearing the end. Remember I said people fear what they don't know the ending of. The sixth person was afraid, his name was Jacob. He betrayed them by speaking of the book and Mehmed. Human weakness it was. I shall start with the name of the Creator. The day has come. Wake up... Judgment day has come. Do not fear the tyrants any longer. You, who have known for years... ...yet stayed silent. - You who said that you were believers... ...but actually never believed. You did not question your God. You, who have all gone to whorehouses... ...then turned to shoot your own daughters calling it morality. Judgement day has come. Wake up. You who look pure on the outside but are actually rotten on the inside. You've neverjudged yourselves. Those who know and stay silent are just as guilty as those who sin. You do not need eyes... You refuse to see. You do not need tongues, you know, but refuse to tell. Until now you didn't hear, didn't look, and didn't see. You didn't listen to the ones who said let us be one. You changed everything to suit yourselves... ...even your religion to suit your needs. You called loving a sin and the forbidden an act of purity. You slandered what you couldn't reach. - You made up words. - He was closer to you then your heart... ...but you knew him to be in the heavens. Judgement day has come, people! - Wake up! - Their uprising... ...turned into doomsday that very night. Mister, we are from the neighboring village. My son is very sick... Please come and take a look at him. I am coming, let me get my bag. They were lying; they got the doctor out of the village that night on purpose. Was this evil... I do not know. "Evil" is just a word, an adjective. Evil couldn't describe the massacre. They killed the youths... ...because they don't know how to live, if they did not... They have the fear of not knowing. The darkness of their hearts and their inability to recognize the good. The uprising turned into doomsday. At the village that they went to... There was no sick boy... There was no one... The men ran off. Mister, it's the house back there. At that moment the doctor knew what was happening, but it did him no good. Mehmed! What had happened, had happened. Mehmed! Mehmed! Mehmed had placed the original book into his father's bag... ...as if he knew what was going to happen. Mehmed never woke up from his bloody slumber again. Now, let's come to the question. Remember... I told you not to imagine anyone you know as the Messenger. Now describe his face. Tell me what Messenger Abraham looks like. David, you start. He is a huge man. Each of his hands are as big as two of mine. His eyes are beautiful, deep blue... like the seas. Whoever sees him, wants to see him again. He is the hero of all tales, he is the greatest. They say he came into this village... Is it true? He did. Yes, he did... David did you see him? I did see him... How could I not? His soul was Mehmed's soul... Wasn't it? - Yes, it was, so were his words. - I am so sad I did not see him. They said he moved onto a neighboring village. Is this true? Yes, it's true... He did go there... He sent you his regards. His eyes were green. He had a shirt on that was the same exact green. All creatures stood in salute along every path he went. The Messenger friend to the meek, enemy to the cruel. It was as if his horse had wings that no one could see. His arms were as large as five of mine. His horse was a huge chestnut horse... He tossed me up in the air and then caught me. He sent you his regards. He said he loved you like he loved his own father. Wait a little longer he said... Just a little more... I am going to come and take you away from this place Ferhat... We will cross the seas and mountains together... You will be free Ferhat... Waitjust a little. You are not going to leave because the tale ended, are you? He won't leave, don't worry. David, Saffet let's go. From that day, the doctor made up a tale in his heart... The rain washed Mehmed's soul into the well water. He created the Messenger and named him Abraham. Every time he told the tale, the Messenger Abraham would get his revenge... ...from the murderers who were still free. He had Mehmed live in the Messenger. He gave him a make believe life. The doctor tried to ease his pain everytime he told the tale over and over. Then, he believed his own tale and went after the Messenger. They speak the truth... I saw the Messenger too. He was a brave man... He said "this village is going to be the last one. " "I'm going to stay here, I'm tired. " "There is no place left for me to go. " If we knew he was here, if you didn't leave... ...if you stayed with us... ...we could wait together... We could believe the same tale. Isn't it possible? Of course it is. If only the storyteller believes his tale, then it cannot be a tale, can it? Of course not. Stay. Stay so we can make it real. Don't sleep, you idiot. Why do you think we're here? I just dozed off a little. Esma and her daughter are coming back from their whoring. I guess our dicks weren't enough for them. What the hell? Just when we were waiting for a quiet night... ...it's turned into a carnival. - That's my son. Ferhat! Get over here... Don't you run off. Where the hell are you coming from at this hour? Answer me. You were with that man, weren't you? Answer me, where were you? I said tell me! I think he was at Ali's old barn. He was coming from there. We are so stupid, why didn't we think of this before? What did that man do to you? Tell me. The tale is not a lie. The Messenger will come. He will show you the darkness of your heart. You! Ferhat! What is happening? - What is happening? Saffet... Saffet. - Where were you? Go on home. - What is going on? - Adam... Ferhat is gone. Ferhat! Sister? What happened? I heard yelling, I wanted to look but I fell. What is all the yelling about Saffet? Who is yelling? It sounds like a festival out there. - Yes, a celebration. A real celebration. - Why? What for? He came. The Messenger has come, Sister. The Messenger is here. So it is true... The tale is true. What happened at the end? Tell me. His head. He hit his head on the stone... You saw didn't you? My son... Do not touch him! Ferhat fell and hit his head. He fell hard brother Zekeriya. - Do not touch him! - It's your fault! All your fault! - Let go, let me go! - Let him go... He is a doctor... He's the only one who can save your son. Don't touch his head. Did he throw up? I am asking you! Someone answer me, did he throw up? - No, no he didn't. - Good, that's good then. Children, go get all the lamps... Stand back... Back... Let me have some light. - Will he live? Brother, will he live? - Quick, bring some water... Cold water. - Mister? - Do not be afraid. Mister... He came, right? The Messenger came? Didn't he? "Saffet's Ending" Then... Whatever happened, happened at that very moment. First, a sound was heard from deep down... All those who believed in the tale knew what the sound was. You can hear the sound everywhere. It was the sound of a chestnut horse galloping. Then the earth trembled beneath their feet. At first everyone thought it was an earthquake. But only those who had listened to the tale knew... It was the Messenger. His horse was faster than the wind, a wild horse. And the Messenger was even larger, and more courageous then they had said. The blowing wind, was the Messenger's breath... The light, coming from the well, was his very soul. The Creator had taken a son from Zekeriya, but gave one back. Only one survived from twenty... The two of them vanished... They just disappeared. Then everything went white. It was as if all the clouds had come down from the sky. ...and covered the village. No one could see anything. For three whole days no one knew if it was day or night. The sun did not rise in that village. A disease took over... ...and it slowly rotted their bodies... It was called leprosy. Eve... Eve... It's over. - Sister Mary open up, it is me. - Come in. I took it from Bedriye's house... It was in the basement. It should be safe from the disease. But it's only enough for today. - What will we do? - I don't know. The poor things even fear to look out of the window. Omar, we need to get out of this town, we have no choice. - The disease has spread to all of them. - I wish you had brought Eve as well. She keeps carrying water for her mother. Their torment will not end. Omar, we need to leave this village. What should we do? They said Ferhat would come, but he didn't... The mightiest of all men took Ferhat... He said he would come, but he didn't. I wonder if they couldn't find their way back? Omar, have you seen Ferhat? At the end of the village there is a glowing bridge of heavenly light, now. And at the end of the bridge, I saw Zekeriya. His face was shining bright like a flame. "I am waiting for all of you Omar. " "Get the children and bring them to me. " "You need to get out of that village. " he said. I saw Brother Zekeriya... ...I also saw Ferhat. They were at the end of a bridge of light... Waiting for us. David, Ali... Do not be scared dears. Do not look, do not look. And do not get separated... Emine. - Mum? - Do not look dear. That is not your mother. We will soon be free of this village... Brother Zekeriya is waiting for us. Eve, dear... Forget about her... Forget everything... We have no choice. - Take her... Save my daughter. - Come on dear, come on. Come with us. Children, don't look back... Don't turn back and look... Forget this village... We must forget this village. Ferhat. Then all of the children held hands. They swore that they would never leave each other. They swore never to fear. They swore to find a new place to live. And you know what did they see... ...when they looked back? Only a crazy wind. And that wind whispered the Messenger's name... Then the wind whispered: "Don't forget. " This film is dedicated to Nisan and to all children who has dreams.
