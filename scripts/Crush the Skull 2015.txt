I think I found a way back up. - Up? Where are we, Mommy? - You know that show you like, where um, people have to compete missions to win prizes. It's just like that. We're, we're in a show, and we just need to win this round. - Mom! - Okay, everything's fine. - Mom! I know it's not a game. (sobbing) - Oh my God. I'm so sorry. (sobbing) My sweet baby. I wish you thought this was all a big game. (ominous music) Oh no. - Mommy, is, is, is the game starting again? - Listen to me. This is not a game. This is real. We have to get out of here. - I know, I thought you wanted me to pretend. - Stay right here, okay? - No! Don't leave me! - I'll be right back. I have to, I have to distract him. (screaming) Please be brave, baby. Okay? Just pretend this is all a big game. - But I thought you said not to! Mommy! (ominous music) (screaming) (groaning) (screaming) (lively music) - Hey. I got one for you. So, there's a man, right, and he gets a call from the hospital, and uh, no wait, hold on. Let me start over. So there's this man, and he's at the hospital, and he has a meeting with this doctor, and he says um... Hey, are you listening? Hey look. I was just saying that I don't know if we have to retire so soon. - That's been the plan this whole time. One last job, travel for a year, settle down and... Find normal lives. - We're so good at this. Do we have to stick to that plan? - Always stick to the plan. - Are you sure this time though? Like really sure. - I'm always sure. I could not be more sure about this. I'm a hundred million billion percent sure. - Yeah, that sounds like you're pretty sure. - We're 30 years old, sitting in a fake painter's van, about to rob a house. - So cool. - It's not cool. It used to be cool. - Okay. This is our last job. As planned. - Are you sure? - I am... 100,000 billion percent sure. - Shut up. - Yeah, sure. - Thank you. (engine starting in distance) - [Man] There she is. - Faster than schedule. - Ready? - Yeah. Finish it. - Finish what? - The joke. - Yes. The joke. So, um... So there's this man. He rushes to the hospital, gets there, the doctor comes out, and he says, I'm so sorry. - Wait, why is he rushing to the hospital? - Oh, his wife was in an accident. Wait. I thought I just said that. So where was I? Um... Oh right, she was in an accident, and the doctor says, uh... - What kind of accident? - Again, so, worst shape possible. She basically lost all of her limbs, so, the doctor says, you know, and she may not be able to recognize you ever, ever again, and the husband says, oh my gosh, this is terrible news. And the doctor says, by the way, she's dead. She's, she's dead. - So a man hears that his wife's in a horrible accident, he rushes to the hospital. When he gets there, the doctor says, I'm so sorry, but the accident has left your wife blind, deaf, and mute, and she'll never be able to recognize you again. The guy's like, oh my God this is terrible news, and that's when the doctor says, I'm just kidding. She's dead. - It's funnier. - [Woman] 30 seconds. - Man, it's really our last one. (laughing) (dramatic music) Ssh. Wrap up, wrap up, wrap up. - Shit. - [Man] We gotta go, we can't go this way. - [Woman] Okay. - [Man] You ready? - [Woman] Yeah. - Ready. - Okay. Where're you going? - I thought you were with me. - Get over here. - [Man] Shit. - [Woman] Shit. (ominous music) - Take your clothes off. - Ah-ha, do it in your place for once. - Who's he home with? - I don't know. She's supposed to be a Pilates. - [Man] Hey, can we bring your dog up on this one? - [Woman] Wait, what? No. - I'm an adult. (door opens) - Wait. - What was that? - [Woman] Oh, God. My husband. Shit. Hide. - [Man] I can go out this window. - No, hide. Get in the closet. Go. (ominous music) (screams) (ominous music) Hi. - Hi, honey. - Honey? Honey, honey. Wait! No! Wait I can... - Oh shit. Shit, shit, shit. Wait, wait, wait. Wait, uh... - Get the fuck out! - Oh my God. Oh my God. Honey, they're robbers. Shoot them. Shoot them, they're robbing us. They're robbers. - No, we're not robbers, okay? We're not robbers. We're... We're swingers. - We're not into foursomes. (laughs) - I'm sorry, I'm sorry. She laughs when she's scared. - Get the fuck out. - Listen, we're not, we're robbers. We are robbers, okay, and she's not fucking us. - [Woman] No. - All right, she's fucking this guy! - [Woman] Oh God, oh shit, okay. - Hello, my name is Juan. I was... Cleaning the pool. - Honey, I can explain, okay? This is, this is Juan. He's... - [Female Robber] No! - [Woman] Honey! (dramatic music) (screaming) - [Female Robber] Where you going? - I have to help them. - No, no no. The cops are gonna be here any second, and you're two strikes. - Okay, you're right, you're right. They're gonna be here, I'm gonna buy them some time. - Well, what about us? - Take the van, go down the street, wait for me there. - No, that's not the plan. - Fuck the plan, Blair, okay. He's gonna kill them. (suspenseful music) (tires screeching) (screaming) - [Man] How could you? I loved you! - Hey. Hey you. This is the police. All right, freeze. Fuck face. We know you're up there, all right? We want you to come out, and reach for the sky, or... I will shoot you in the face. (gunshots) (screaming) Oh shit. Shit. Shit, shit. (ominous music) (gun clicking) (police siren) (suspenseful music) - Hey! Police! Freeze, fuck face! Hands in the air. - Stop. Reach for the sky or I will shoot you in the face. (groaning) What do you know about me, boy? - Now it's done. I'm callin' this in. Thank you. Hey, guess what? In case you didn't know, you have the right to remain silent, bitch. (ominous music) - [Man] Hello. (ominous music) No, no, no, no! Shit. - [Man] Hey. You, you're out. (dramatic music) - Where you taking me? - Shut the fuck up. We're almost there. (dramatic music) - Are you okay? - Yeah. (engine starts) Blair, I'm so sorry. Okay, I'm, I'm a fucking idiot. I just... Please don't tell me those were Timmy Song's guys. - He's the only one powerful enough to get you out. - Okay. Blair, we have to go. We have to get out of town right now. - No, Ollie. I gave him everything we had. And I had to borrow on top of that. Look, you don't have to worry about that right now. - No, I have to worry about it, okay? He calculates his late fees in body parts. All right, when's our first payment? - Next week. - Fuck. - I set the thing up already for tomorrow. - What do you mean, tomorrow? - Connor offered. It's a vacation home- - Connor? The reason why I have two strikes is because your brother is incompetent. He's reckless. All right, he can't read. - Hey. I looked over the plans and they look good. Okay? Easy. - All right. Okay, after this, it's our last one. This time for real. Our last one. I should have listened to you. We should have stopped a long time ago, but I kept... - [Blair] Ollie! - What? - He won't work with you again. We're doing this job without you. Shit. - [Connor] All right, let's go over this again. - All right. 7:00 AM we leave from here. 8:30 we arrive at the house. I back the van all the way up to the front. 8:35, you pick the lock, and open the side door. - Okay. - Blair keeps the van runnin', and you and me load up. - Good job. You got any problems picking up the van? - No. - All right, so it's all filled up, we're ready to go? - Filled up? - Riley. Come on, man. Details. - No... I'm sorry. You mad? - I'm not mad, I just, I'm disappointed. All right? You're my crew. So bring your A game. - I'll go do it right now. - No, forget it. I mean, we have enough time tomorrow morning to fill up the tank. It's the principle of the thing. Let's just go over this again. - Hey. - Hey. - Hey. - Ollie. What's he doin' here? - Just hear 'im out. - No. - Connor, I just came by to say that I appreciate all the help. - Jellyfish. Yeah, I'm really just helping my sister out. So... - I understand that, and thank you. - Yeah. - So, uh, what's the plan? - Well, 7 AM we leave from here- - Riley, no. Stop. He's not part of the crew. Didn't my sister tell you? You're not in. - I understand that, Connor. I was just, wanted to see what you guys had planned. - No. This is exactly my problem with you. - You're problem with me? - You want me to take care of this, boss? - Step back. - You just tell me to step back? Don't tell me to step back. I'll step back if I want. I'll step off, I'll step up to the streets if I want to. - You know what my problem is with you, Ollie? Your lack of respect. That's my problem with you. - I, I respect you. - No you don't. You don't trust me. Never have. - Maybe that's because you've landed me in jail twice. - That's not helping. - You're not helpin'. - Where'd you get this guy? - I told you to play dead. I escaped because I played dead. - Played dead? - Yeah. That wasn't my fault. - Get me? - [Blair] Yeah. - Where'd you come from? I've known this guy for six months. - What is that? - It's a good plan. - I'm his crew, we go way back. What about you? - I'm his sister. - Okay, everyone stop. This is my lead, my research, my job. You're out. - No, wait. Connor listen. Look, I'm begging you, okay. I'm begging you to let me go. Look, the only reason Blair is here, the reason why we're in this mess, it's because of me. I didn't put her first, and now we've lost everything. And I can't risk losing her too. I don't care about the plans, I don't care about the score. I'm begging you. Please let me come. - If I let you come... I have ground rules. First, the cut remains the same. You're not gettin' any extra money for coming along. - Totally fair. - Yeah. - Second, you're lookout only. You're not goin' inside. - Can't he be lookout? - It's fine. Actually, yeah, can he be lookout? - I'm not done. Last, you need to respect my leadership skills. I'm the leader, okay, and you need to treat me accordingly. - You realize that real leaders don't tell others they have leadership skills, but you got- - You sure about that, man? I mean, this is my heist, right? - This is just a robbery. Look, this is your heist, you're the leader and I respect your leadership skills. - Too late, homie. - All right. - All right. - [Connor] You can come along on the heist. - [Ollie] It's not a heist. - Thank you. - Hey, all right. Yeah, okay. - Thank you. - Yeah. - It means a lot. (ominous music) (screaming) (dramatic music) - You guys hear me okay? - Yep. - Clear up here. - All right. Be back in a minute. All right, guys, let me show you how the big boys do it. - I'm buyin' boobs. What are you gonna get? - What? - With the money from this. My girlfriend needs bigger boobs. It's the first thing I'm buyin'. What about you? - I like my boobs. So your girlfriend just straight up said, honey, buy me boobs? - Naw, she didn't know about it, but she's mad at me, so, I'm gonna surprise her. Hey, turn around for a sec. Where'd you get your boobs? Yours are real, huh? Nice. - Riley, if you don't stop looking at my boobs, I will uppercut your dick, I swear to God. - That would hurt. - Is everything okay? - Yeah, Riley's just telling me about how he's buying new boobs for his girlfriend. What, is she mad at you or something, Riley? - Yeah. She mad at me 'cause I wanna go to Mars. - This just keeps gettin' better and better. - Wait. You were serious? - Yeah, and I signed up on a program, where you can win a one-way trip to Mars. I think it's like a nine-month ride in space. And she don't understand why I wanna do it, but I'm like, come on, man. It's Mars. Like, I could be the Magellan of space. I mean, I might not actually be Magellan. I'm sure I'd be like his first mate or somethin'. I don't know. I don't know. They're probably not gonna pick me. - Don't give up hope, Riley. You never know. Hey, what's Connor doin'? - Connor. What's goin' on? - [Connor] Everything's fine, I'm just gonna go around to the back. - Hey, player, I have one for you. So, a cop shows up to a crime scene, and a citizen shows up and says, officer, officer, quick, there is a hundred minorities and a plumber that really need your help, and um... And the cop says, oh no, we should help the plumber, and the citizen says, see, cops never care about the minorities. Wait, is that right? - Okay. A citizen runs up to a cop and says a hundred minorities and a plumber need your help, the cop says, why the plumber? Then the citizen says, see, the cops never ask about the minorities. - Damn it. - He just forgot all the important parts, right. - Fucking cops hate minorities, man. Dude, I got pulled over for tinted windows once. Hate the Po Po. - I'm in hell. (gun clicking) What are you doing? - Just being safe. - There's no one in the house. - You sure about that? I mean, you never know. - No, our whole job depends on being sure. You should always know. How long did you monitor the owner's pattern? I know the plans say he won't be back for a few weeks, but how long did you monitor his routine? - Like, two- - Two months? - Two weeks. Two months? - Connor. Connor, come in. - I don't see him. How long has it been? - Just a few minutes. - Did he forget how to pick a lock? That's not a rhetorical question. - Yeah, no, I agree. That's a fair question. Hang on. You stay in the van. You don't need to bring that. - [Riley] You're not the boss. - Hey, Blair, maybe I should come down there. - [Blair] No, we got this, all right. - It just, something's not right. - [Blair] Stay put, stick with the plan. - Blair, can you hear me? Blair? Blair, Blair. Hello? Hello, hello, hello, hello. Blair, Blair, Blair, Blair, Blair, Blair. Shit. Just stick to the plan. Just stick to the plan. (dramatic music) Yeah, we'll stick to the plan. We're good. We'll just ah... Stick to the plan, and it will be, you know what, fuck the plan. (dramatic music) (birds squawking) (ominous music) Blair! Connor. (screaming) Blair, Blair. (ominous music) Ow, ow ow ow. Ow, ow. (ominous music) Shit. Blair. Blair. Fuck. Come on, Blair. Where the fuck are you? Blair? (ominous music) - Sorry. - Shit, Blair. Fuck. - How did you get in here? - From the skylight. - Fuck. - Listen, I heard you scream. Are you okay? - I wasn't screaming. - I've been calling you guys. What are you been doing? Everything's dead. - [Blair] I know. - [Connor] Move, move, get out of the way. Come on, hurry, move. You ready? - [Riley] Yeah. (screaming) (groaning) - I told you guys it wasn't gonna work. - What the fuck, man? You're supposed to be on lookout? - What's goin' on? - We're trying to find a way out. But everything's locked from the outside, and these locks, I just never seen anything like them. The walls are concrete, and I was telling the guys I think the windows are palladium- - Palladium plated. Actually, that means you can't break the windows. We're just double checking. - I know what it means, Connor. - Don't fucking start with me, man. All right? I've got this under control. - [Ollie] What about calling out? - Nothing works. Cell phones, walkie, everything's, there's no signal. - This is really fuckin' bad, man. Ah, Goddamn, I think I broke my ass. - You got a gun? - [Riley] Yeah. - Well let's use it. - What? - [Connor] Get out of the way. - No, no no. - [Connor] Get out of the way. (gunshot) - Ah fuck, Riley. Shit, what are you... (gunshot) Ah, stop. - [Blair] Shit. - [Ollie] Just stop. (gunshots) - Look. - [Ollie] Ah, shit. Yeah, that's ah, that's palladium. - Riley, you're a fucking idiot. - Man, just say what? - Don't talk to my crew like that. At least he's doin' something. - Have you tried playing dead? - I gotta show you somethin'. (ominous music) - Blair, I don't get it. I mean, there's nothing in this house. Why would anyone keep it on lock down? - It gets worse. (ominous music) - Great. What, we gonna pay Timmy Song back with with a 200 dollar TV? (ominous music) So he's into low-budget slasher flicks. Really, really big special effects budgets. Same place. - Same place. Ollie, I'm really scared. - Blair. - Let's get out of here. - I was gonna say I'm really scared too, but yeah, let's get the fuck outta here. How can Conner's inside not know this? Hey. He had an inside, right? That's what it said in the plans. - No, he lied on the plans. There's no inside. Shit. (ominous music) - Connor! - [Connor] Shit. - It's all your fuckin' fault. (groaning) (gun clicks) - Sit down. - You can't punch the leader. - You are not a leader, okay. You're a fuck up. You've always been a fuck up. - I need you to calm down. Okay, we need to figure out a plan before that sick fuck comes home. - What about the skylight? - That's like 25 feet up. Even if we stand on each other's shoulders circus style, we won't be able to reach it. - We tried that already. - Text. - I thought you said the signals are blocked. - I'll just ah, hit send and throw it to the skylight. - It's a signal jammer, okay. We find the jammer, we kill it, then we call for help. Look, it's a new plan guys, all right. You guys, you sweep this are out here for the jammer, Blair and I will take the bedroom. - You don't tell me what to do. - Can you wait for me? (sighs) Riley. - [Riley] Yeah. - Hey. I need you with us, okay. We gotta find that jammer. - He's right. - [Blair] No. - I'm a fuck up. - No, you're not. We all make mistakes. Look at me, I'm in deep with Timmy Song, right. - I will never let him near you. Okay? Ever. - I know you won't. Good? - Yeah. Riley and I will sweep this area. - [Blair] Thank you. - Can I have my gun back? - [Blair] No. - [Connor] Come on, just, come on. - You guys know what a jammer looks like, right? - [Riley] Does it have like a fan on it? - Fuck. I knew he'd find a way to fuck this up. He always does. He has not changed at all. - Ollie, can you please just stop? He's still my brother. - [Ollie] It's not in here. - What the hell? I already checked there. - What? - Nothing. (dramatic music) - Dude, I'm just sayin', don't let 'im talk to you like that. Fuck 'im. No, seriously, you say the word, I'll clan his ass, son. - Don't worry about it, all right. I need you to focus. Come on, Riley. Help me out. There's not even any fuckin' silverware in this place. - Oh no. - What? What is it? - There's no beer. - What the fuck is wrong with you? Oh shit. Come on, come on. - Oh shit. - [Connor] Blair, Ollie. - Did you find it? - No. The skylight is sealed shut. - [Ollie] How did you open it in the first place? - It was already wide open. I just went through. - Us too. - He's back. - Yeah, well we got a fuckin' gun. Why don't we use it? - There's only one bullet. - Riley, how many bullets did you bring? - Well, you only need one bullet to take 'em out, right? - Technically that's true. So here's the plan. - No way. Guns and Riley don't mix. - Will you stop insulting my crew? - You guys, no new plans. We stay together, and we find the jammer, okay. - Where? We already checked everywhere. - Not everywhere. - Damn it. I got nothing. - That's because it's not down here. - Shhh! - Blair, give me the gun. - No. - Well then give Riley the gun. - [Riley] My gun. - [Connor] Yeah, it's his gun. Now look, I'm making an executive decision here. We're gonna go after this sick fuck, and we're gonna take him out. - Are you fucking kidding me? We just saw what he's capable of. I'm not going after him with one bullet. - Blair. I found something. (ominous music) I bet you the jammer's down here. - [Riley] No. Ah. Mm-mmm, mm-mmm. - [Ollie] Ah, that's right. You're claustrophobic. - [Riley] Fuck claustrophobia. Dude, you never ever go into a dark underground layer. - [Blair] That's the smartest thing I've ever heard you say. Ever. - [Connor] Stop insulting my crew. - [Blair] I was complimenting him. - [Riley] I what you doin'. Thank you. - [Ollie] Riley, you want your gun back? - [Riley] Yeah. - [Ollie] You can have it if you go first. - [Blair] Are you sure? - [Ollie] Deal? - Let's just get this over with. - Hey, you know who always dies first in these situations? The black guy. (ominous music) - [Connor] What the fuck is this place? - What is that? (laughing) - Blair. - Sorry, sorry. - You still do that? She laughs when she's scared. - Dude, I thought it was a ghost. - Really? A ghost? - I'm afraid of ghosts, okay. - [Connor] Riley, keep going. - Okay, okay, okay. - [Connor] Wait a second. - [Riley] What? - What do you think are behind these doors? - Oh, you know. Cleaning supplies, toilet paper. - [Riley] Really? - No! Not really. - Connor, sssh. - [Connor] You idiot. - Don't talk to me like that. I'm your crew. - [Ollie] Riley, just, keep going. - Okay. Oh shit. - [Blair] Gimme that. - No. (screaming) What the fuck? - [Ollie] What was that? - [Blair] Find the jammer. - [Ollie] Wait. - [Connor] Riley! Fuck, it's a dead end. - Okay, okay. I think we're done here. We need to go back upstairs. I don't wanna anger the spirits. - [Blair] Agreed, agreed. Okay. - Wait, wait. Hold on, hold on, hold on. Do you see that? - [Blair] What? (ominous music) I think this is it. Is that it? - [Blair] Yeah, it looks like it. - [Ollie] How do you turn it off? - [Blair] Yep, that works. - Okay. I think it's off. - [Blair] Everyone try your phones. - [Riley] Okay. Who do we call? - 3-1-1. - [Connor] Call 9-1-1. - No. We can't call the cops. Dude, you are on your third strike. I'm on my fourth. - He's right. You can't go back. - You guys, we have to, we have to worry about getting out of here alive first. - Stupid phone. I should have upgraded this piece of shit, but no, I had to save money for boobs. - I have one bar. (cell phone beeping) (ringback tone) - [911 Dispatcher] 911 Sheriff's Department. - Hello. - [911 Dispatcher] Sheriff's Department. - I'm in a house at the very end of Sange Road. There's, there's four of us. We're being held against our- - [911 Dispatcher] Department... - I'm a white person! Shit. I don't know if it went through. - Let's go upstairs. Okay. Stay together. Go upstairs. - Yeah, I like that idea. (ominous music) (ominous music) - Hello. Is someone there? My name is Vivian Thorpe. (sobbing) I have been a prisoner in here for weeks now. (crying) - Wait. We have to get a signal first. - Blair, we gotta help her. - We're gonna help her, but we can't help anyone until we get a signal. - It's gonna take two seconds to get our- - Both of you stop. Blair's right. - Connor, shut up. - I'll help her. Riley and I got this. - Hey, what? - [Blair] No. - Right? - Fuck it. Let's do it. - We're staying together. - Just go find a signal. Go. - [Ollie] We'll go, we'll go. - [Blair] No. - [Vivian] Wait. The door. - Spirits. - [Ollie] Oh, no no no. - [Blair] Connor! - Yeah. - Are you okay? - Yeah, we're fine. Look, we're gonna, we're gonna figure out how to get her out of that thing, then we'll find a way out. Just, find a signal. - No, we're not leaving you. - Blair, just go find a signal, okay. - [Ollie] We gotta go, we gotta go. We'll be back. - Okay. Let's get her out of that thing. (door rattling) - [Ollie] No, no no no no no. - [Blair] Shit. - [Ollie] All right, uh, let's take a guess signal here. - [Blair] My phone's dead. - Here. I'm gonna try to get this open. Okay. Ready to move? - [Blair] No. - Are you sure? - [Connor] Hey. Hi. Oh shit. You okay? - Who are you? How did you find this place? - We're nobody. We just found it by chance. - Are you okay? You need some food? - Yes. Please. - I'm sorry. I don't have any. - What? - What the fuck, Riley? - No, um, I thought... - Why would you say that? - I'm sorry. I thought that... - I'm so hungry. - I thought there was a cracker, or like some fruit left or some shit. I don't know. (screaming) - [Connor] Put that away. - Oh, I'm sorry. - Are you here to hurt me? - No no no. No no. No no, we don't wanna hurt you. Okay. Not at all. I'm sorry about him. - Yeah. - We're robbers, and we're stuck down here with you. - You're robbers? - Yeah. - You don't make any sense. - We were pulling a heist. I'm the leader. He's part of my crew. - Yeah, don't, don't judge us on our rugged exterior. - Find anything yet? - Nothing. I think we just should have sent that text. - Look, it was a good plan, okay. We found the jammer, we killed it, we could have gotten a phone call out. - So no one knows that you're here? - No. - Wait a minute. Why would you rob this place? - We, we thought it was legit. There was no one here. We watched it for two weeks. - Oh God. Oh God. You're lying to me. You have to be lying. - [Riley] What? - I don't know anything about robbing, but I do know that two weeks is not enough time. - No, two weeks is the perfect amount of time. - It's not enough time. - That's more than enough time. - Yeah, so much time. Oh my God. - We can do a lot in two weeks. - Plenty of time. An eternity. - Hey, you know what? My driver and our lookout, they're calling the cops right now, so you're gonna be okay. Everything's over. Now we just all need to sit tight. - What? No. No, no no no. No, we can't do that. He's gonna be back here. He's gonna kill us. You don't understand. - Who? - Him. (ominous music) He's not right in the head. He did things to me. (crying) - You want a tissue? Never mind. - [Vivian] Just get me out of here. Please. - Okay, hey, hey. (screaming) - Okay, no no no. I'm not trying to touch you. Okay, I don't wanna touch you. - [Vivian] Don't look at me. - [Connor] Okay, we're not looking at... (ominous music) - [Riley] Hey, dude. Hey dude, dude. - Hey! Wait! Wait, we're just trying to help you. Wait, wait. (ominous music) Riley? Riley! (gunshot) - [Blair] What was that? - [Connor] Dude. - [Ollie] Riley.

Wait. - Stay away, stay away. - We're not gonna hurt you. It was Vivian, right? - [Vivian] Yeah. - Where's that guy that was with you? - I don't know. I don't know him. He was... He was behind me. - Gimme your phone. (ominous music) - You have a phone? Did you call someone? - We did, we, got a call out. - Are they coming? - We're not sure. - They're not coming. - The signal was in and out, but, it still might have gone through. Look, Vivian, we need to find a way out. - [Vivian] I can't. I can't. - [Ollie] Do you know of anything, any way out? - Are you sure he was behind you? - [Vivian] Yes. (sobbing) - I don't trust her. - What do you mean? - I just... I have a bad feeling about it, I, we need to find some rope with her. - Blair, she's been kidnapped... - [Blair] I know. - She's probably traumatized. - I know that, but she's been here for weeks, right? I'm pretty sure that's a fresh pedicure on her feet. - You're basing all of this on nail polish? - Yeah. - Did you get a good look? - Yeah. I know. I think so. - Maybe she got a gel pedi before she got kidnapped. - How do you know it? It doesn't matter, I just... I think, I think maybe we should tie her up. - Tie her up? Are you listening to yourself? She's been tortured. No, I'm not doing it. I'm not doing it. - [Vivian] Are you guys robbers? (ominous music) (screaming) - Sorry, Vivian, we... Who told you we were robbers? - Your leader. He wasn't very good. - Connor. - I think it's my fault. I think I took a wrong turn. I don't know. - Do you know where he is? - Maybe. - Can you show me? - Yeah. - [Ollie] Blair, be careful. Wait, where's the knife? - [Blair] Connor. - [Blair] Connor. - [Connor] Blair! - [Blair] Connor! - [Vivian] Wait. - No. Blair! Wait. Oh fuck. Blair. Blair, what's happening? - Ollie. - Blair, what's goin' on? Blair. - [Blair] Vivian. What is that? - I don't know. - [Blair] What are you doing? - I'm sorry. I have to. - [Blair] No, don't do that. - I see it. - [Blair] Don't, don't do that. (screaming) - Quick. Blair. Hold on. Hold on, okay. (screaming) - Ollie, get us outta here! (ominous music) Please hurry! - What's happening? What's going on? - [Connor] Ollie, Blair! - Connor! Connor! - Connor! - [Blair] Connor! - [Connor] Yeah, it's me. Are you okay? - I'm okay. I'm with Vivian and I'm... We got separated from Ollie. He's in the room next door. - [Connor] It's him. He's doing it on purpose. Where's Riley? - He's dead. - [Connor] Okay, listen. He needs help. Tell Ollie I don't wanna be the leader anymore. He can be the leader, okay, 'cause I just... I don't, wait... I think somebody's in here with me. Hello? - What's happening? - Blair, what's happening? What's going on? - [Connor] Somebody's in here, Blair. - Oh, God, Connor. It's not a ghost, okay. You have to run. - [Connor] Why would I think it's a ghost, Blair? Come on! Whoa! Blair! (screaming) - No, Blair, no! Connor! - Don't you touch him, you motherfucker! Connor! (crying) Connor! (sobbing) (somber music) (buzzing) (buzzing) - What the hell is that? Blair, the cops.

We have to stay away from the wall, all right? Okay, here we go. Ready? Oh shit. Come on, come on, come on. It's not working. - [Blair] I have an idea. - Okay, hurry. He's talking to the sheriff. - I sure do appreciate you letting me take a look around, Mr. Tucker. - Please. Call me Jack. Ain't no problem at all, Sheriff. Anything I can do to help. (ominous music) - It's working. Come on. Are you all right, hon? Did he hurt you? I'm sorry, look... The sheriff's upstairs, all right. We have to warn him. I need you to help me open the door. Can you do that? Okay. I'm gonna hook this out through the door. - Okay. - [Ollie] Then you turn it on, all right. - [Jack] Catch you a cup of coffee, Sheriff? Homemade iced tea? - No, thank you. I'm sorry. How long did you say you lived here? - I didn't. - Well, how long? - Long time. - And not a lot of decorations in this nice house. - No, never had that for that kind of thing. - Is that right? - Well, my wife Betty, she... She took care of all that stuff before she passed on. - Nothing quite like a woman's touch, huh. My wife died just last year. - Well, my condolences, Sheriff. Suppose it'll get better with time. I mean, that's what they deal ya. - That's what they tell ya. - Yep. - Well... Sorry to take your time, Jack. You have a good day. (ominous music) - [Ollie] We're almost there. (screaming) Wait. (ominous music) Oh shit. (screaming) No, forget it. Let's go, let's go! Come on. Look, baby, we're so close. You can do this. Let's go. - [Vivian] I can't. - Vivian, how long have you been down here? - [Vivian] Weeks. Once, I don't know. - This is your chance to get out. We have to go. - [Vivian] I cant. (sobbing) - [Blair] Fuck it. Leave her. - [Ollie] You can't leave her. - [Sheriff] Beautiful land you got out here. - [Jack] Thank you kindly. - [Sheriff] I guess it was just kids playing around with the phone. Take care. - Sorry you had to drive all this way, Sheriff. - [Blair] Don't go! - [Ollie] Wait, wait! - What the hell? Stay where you are! - Wait, we're trapped in the house. - Stay where you are. - The pair of dead bodies inside. Our friends, okay. (ominous music) (laughing) Blair. I'm sorry, she does that when she's scared. - Everybody down on the ground now! Do it. - Officer, you're not listening to me. This man is a murderer, okay. He killed both of our friends. - That's a lie. - Just do what I say, and we'll sort this out. - Sheriff. I couldn't say anything before, but, they've been holding me hostage, and they're robbin' my house. - That's a fuckin' lie. Don't believe him. - Everybody shut up! You will talk only when I say so. Is that clear? - Officer, you gotta listen to me. - Shut up. Take these, cuff yourselves to that post right over there. - What about him? - He said shut up. - You shut up. - No, you shut up. - Everybody shut up! Let me take care of him, all right? Just do what I say. - Look officer, you're making a mistake, okay. You need to cuff that man up right now. - All right, let me see the cuffs. Give 'em a tug. Dispatch, I got a situation over here. - The jammer. - Angie come back. - Officer, you can't get a call out, because this man, he has a jammer inside. Look, we, we turned it off, but he must have turned it back on. - Be quiet. - What's a jammer? I don't even have a phone. - Son of a bitch. - All right. Now he said that the two of you we're trying to rob him. Is that true? - [Blair] No. - [Ollie] Yes. - Officer, yes, it's true. We broke into his house to rob him, okay, but, he's been keeping us against our will, underground in a torture den. - An underground torture den? - There's a secret door. If you look inside... - Secret door? - In the basement, a secret... - Let me get this straight. The two of you were trying to rob the house of some kind of serial killer? This man? - [Ollie] Yes! - [Blair] Yes! - Do I look like Sheriff dumb dumb to you? - [Blair] Yes. - [Ollie] No. - Oh no you didn't. - Listen, it doesn't matter. Arrest all of us, okay. - Just take us with you. Just get us out of here. (screaming) - Help me! - Don't trust her! - No, wait. - They're with me. They saved me. It's him. He's been keeping me prisoner for weeks. - You. Get your face on the ground right now. - He's a psychopath. He did things to me. - I told you she's innocent. - My God, are you all right? C'mere, it's gonna be okay. - [Vivian] Just take me away. Oh God. - [Sheriff] C'mere. Angie. Angie, I need backup right now. - It's over, I can't believe it's over. Ow. - Pick the lock. - Why? - Those videos that we saw, who was holding the camera? There was someone else in the room. - [Sheriff] Angie, I need back up right now. You copy? Angie? (ominous music) - [Blair] Run! (gunshots) - Oh shit. Other way, other way. (gunshots) Go, go go go. Go. Are you okay? Are you with me? - No, no no. I'm okay. - Oh shit. Shit. (ominous music) - Don't go anywhere. I'll be right back. Bye. (ominous music) - I fucking told you she was evil. (ominous music) - [Ollie] Blair, we um, we need to barricade the doors. All right? We need to barricade the doors, we need to buy some time. All right? We gotta keep moving. Look, they're calculated killers, okay. Blair, look, if someone comes looking for the sheriff... They're gonna wanna make sure there aren't any signs that anything happened. Okay? So, that means that, they're gonna have to hide his body, or hide his patrol car, and hide our van. Okay, so there's some time. There's a little bit of time. Okay? Look, that wasn't our last chance. There's uh, there's gotta be another way out. We could've missed something. All right? Look, here's the plan. We're gonna... Um, start a fire in the kitchen, and it'll distract them. Then we'll run. - There is no plan. What are you gonna do with that? - I don't know. - I shouldn't have borrowed that money. - No, Blair, this is not your fault. Okay? It's not. All right. Two kids come back from Christmas break. The first kid says to the second kid, I had the best Christmas ever. Got a new XBOX with every single game for it, a new bicycle, season tickets to my favorite basketball team. What did you get? Second kid says, I only got a sweater. First kid says, why. Second kid says... It's because I don't have cancer, Jimmy. (laughing) I know you're scared. - No, it's... Actually kind of funny. (gentle music) I'm pregnant. - What? - Oh my God. I'm not. I... I just wanted to know what it would feel like to say that. That's why I wanted to retire. Sorry. - No, I'm sorry. I'm so sorry, Blair. Look, I shouldn't a... I shouldn't have pushed us to do all those jobs. I shouldn't have gone back into that fucking house. I should have put you first. - [Vivian] Hello friends! Are we having fun yet? - Listen, this is what's gonna happen, all right. They're gonna come in, I'm gonna lure them away, you find a safe place to hide until somebody gets here. - I'm not leaving you. - No, they're gonna come for the sheriff, so you gotta stay alive until then. - We have to stay together. Please. Please. - You have to swear to me that you'll run and hide, okay? Swear to me. It's the only way, Blair. Blair, come on, you know it's the only way. (gentle music) Okay. - Okay. - I love you, okay. Get ready to run and hide. Oh Jesus! Get back. - [Blair] Oh my God, Connor. - [Connor] Ow. - [Blair] Sorry. - [Connor] Come on, hurry. Go downstairs, go downstairs. Hurry. - [Ollie] Why are we going downstairs? - [Connor] I need to show you something. - [Ollie] We got you, we got you. Let's go, let's go. - [Blair] How did you? - I heard the buzz, then I played dead. - Played dead? Of course you did. Oh wait. Connor, I... (ominous music) - Riley. I'm so sorry. Thought I'd say goodbye. Hey. I'm sorry, man. You were the best crew I've ever had. Listen... If I get out of here, I swear to you, I swear to you, I'm gonna buy your girl those boobs. I love you, bro. - Oh, Connor. No! (screaming) - [Ollie] It's all right, it's all right, it's all right. It's all right. I should have told you I tried that. - All right, come on man. We gotta move, we gotta move. - What are we gonna do? We gonna hide and wait it out? - You gotta see this. (ominous music) Look at this. This is how they're separating us. You can control the doors from here. Watch. (ominous music) - [Blair] There they are. - [Connor] Yeah. - They don't even care we're down here. - Yeah, but they don't know that we know about this room. Not yet. Now look, I've... I've been monitoring surveillance, okay, and I think I found a way out. - Where? - Okay, look at this. Look at this. You see that room right there? Those are, those are drainage ducts right there. Now, it's a tight squeeze, but I checked it out, and I think you guys can fit through it. - What do you mean you guys? - Look, I can hide. I'll stay here. I'm gonna slow you down. - Connor. - Look, it's the only way to do this, Blair. Okay. You guys, you guys go out, phone for help and then, I'll hide down here and- - We're not leaving you again. - I would leave me. - No, we're staying. (ominous music) How many people have they killed? If we leave, they get away, and they'll kill again. We can't live with that. We should have done what Connor was saying all along. - Play dead. - Go on offense. - Go on offense. - Blair, I know what you're thinking, but I am putting you first. If we don't stop them, we'll never be safe. - No, I know. We have to do the right thing. - Hey guys. Look. I know you don't have any reason to trust me right now, but, I think I have a plan. We should pull a heist on them. (ominous music) (fly buzzing) (ominous music) (lively music) - [Ollie] Shit. - What happened? - Tripped. - Oh, go go go. - Blair. - Okay. - [Ollie] Shit. (ominous music) - First door. - Connor. - Open the door. - I don't know. Don't just stand there. C'mon. - Open the door. - [Blair] Wrong door. - [Ollie] Wrong door, Connor. C'mon. - I'm trying. - [Blair] Hurry. - [Ollie] Second door. Go on, second door. - Shit. - [Ollie] Connor! (ominous music) - Fuck you both. Oh shit. - Ollie. Oh good. You're with me. (suspenseful music) - [Ollie] Connor, close the doors. - Damn it. Shit. Oh. (ominous music) Shit. - [Blair] Connor, open the door. - [Ollie] Oh, I got him. Blair, I got 'im. Shit, okay, wait, I don't got 'im. (ominous music) (gunshots) (screaming in agony) - Splish splash. Oh shit. Thanks. (groaning) (suspenseful music) - Hey. (choking) Are you okay? What were you gonna do with that? Are you okay? - I think I broke a rib. - [Blair] Oh God. - Ow, ow ow. Blair. - I'm sorry. I thought that would help. - [Connor] Ollie, Blair. - Connor, we're in here. - [Connor] Hey. Hey. Are you guys okay? Holy shit. It worked. - Yeah. Good plan. - Okay, I thought we'd all be dead by now. Yeah, we're not, so... - [Ollie] Where's Vivian? - I don't know. She was... (ominous music) - Ollie! (screaming) Did you get her? - Yeah, I don't know. I don't know. (screaming) - [Blair] Holy shit! - Okay, can we leave now? Please. Go. Let's go. - Wait. Are we sure he's dead? - Yeah. He looks dead. - He's dead. - But are we 100 percent sure? We've said it a thousand times. In our line of work, we have to be sure. - Blair, what are you saying? - I think we have to stab him in the heart. Or, cut off his head, or... Crush the skull. (breathing heavily) - Okay. Ah... (ominous music) Blair, I'm like 99 percent sure he's dead. - Just get it over with. Just... Whack his head as hard as you can. - Get a good grip. (laughing) - [Ollie] Shit. Blair, you scared the shit out of me. - [Connor] Ollie! - Oh fuck. - Crush the skull! (ominous music) - [Voiceover] See, it's okay. Everything's gonna be just fine. What's your name? - Macy. - [Voiceover] No it's not. It's Vivian. Your name is Vivian Dorp. (ominous music) (suspenseful music)
