I do, but they've hassled me for over a year to get a job. Pick me up in an hour. Enjoy it, man. Well, as you know, your grades are not the best... You've failed Math, Accounting and English. So what! Well, I always say grades are not everything. What is important is how you do your job... But, I think you can handle it. Yeah. Would you like a coffee? How about a beer? Maggie, coffee for just me, please. Sorry, there's no smoking here. OK, OK. Well, here are the facts. We've got 12 employees and they are very... qualified. You would have to take an entree test. And when would that be? We'll tell you in time. Maggie, very good. Just put it here. You're welcome. Maggie, please remind me of that phone call. Well, you'll know soon enough. I'm going to be honest with you... We were really looking for a more sincere person... for the job, as it demands a lot of responsibility. Don't consider this as a no thank you. With enough will power, you could change a little. That is, if you wanted to. Kiss my ass. Us...workers, eh? Yeah man, I was gonna be an honest sucker. Forget it! Eh man, I didn't want to hang around you shits anyway. Pass me a beer. What are we gonna do next? We still gotta hassle the Rats. Well, lets go. Go man, go.

Kiss my ass! I've had enough of your rudeness! Hello. Dad and I have to leave now and you have to go to bed. No. Sure, give it a try. -No- Come on, you want to go with us next vacation, don't you? I don't want to. Sure you do. Peter is here and he'll look after you. He'll only bring along his stupid friends. Well, then I'll tell him off. That isn't going to help. Then you just call me. Come on, Annette. Come on. Bullshit! I'm not looking after that bitch. I've got better things to do! As long as you live under this roof you will do as I say! Do you hear me? Fuck you! Please Peter, listen to what your father says. Please. Back off! Well, my friend, I think you better pull yourself together... and if you're not home when we get back, you'll be in big trouble! Stop, you're hurting him! -...and you'll not see Steve again!- This drug addict! I don't know what's wrong with him. He's been acting like this the past two weeks. Don't worry darling, I'll find out. I've told you before not to play with this one! Daddy. You can't sleep, can you? I thought I'd read a story to you so you can fall asleep, OK? The story is called... JULIA'S LOVE. PSYCHIATRIC CLINIC So Dr. Ricks - I'd still like to introduce you to our patient, Parker. Parker? Parker? What about him? Well, yesterday we had to lock him up again. He got uneasy and then violent. The consequence was a warden with a smashed knee cap. Parker, Parker... Oh, you mean Cliff Parker, the woman murderer? Yes, that's the one. Tell me about him. Here are his records. His grandfather slaughtered his entire family right before his eyes. He was ten years old. Since then, he has been in and out of many orphanages. At 13, he was noticed for the first time. He cut off the thumb of one of his classmates. Later, he made killing his hobby. He has murdered 21 people. I had started therapy with him. And he was coming along just fine. I extended his personal room to move. Yes, but then yesterday. Well, as we can see in his records, it's clear case of Schizophrenia. So, what do you want with therapy? I don't see this as a lost cause. I rather think it's a... Yes, I would even continue the therapy. You're going to do what? Yes, I will continue with it. I have to. He's so intelligent, not just some kind of maniac. Yes, he is fascinating. He is so... He is a psychopath, Dr. Morris, do you understand? There is nothing you can get out of him. He's just a monster. Leave this man in the isolation ward and forget about him. I don't think you know this. I had stopped all his medications. Shit, see what happened due to you taking him into therapy. Hurry, go sound the alarm! Hurry, get going! Where is she? Dear Julia, We'll be back tonight. Dinner is in the stove. Mom. I'm going on a date. Hi. Oh, it's you. Why do you call me? Why? I've told you there is absolutely no sense in it. I told you not to call me anymore. Can't you just forget everything? I don't want to. Listen, there is absolutely no reason for you to call me. Just forget it, OK. Good-bye. Hey, I don't have much time. I've got to run. Why, what are you up to this time? I have a date tonight. Really, with who? You don't know him. I've never seen him around myself. What's his name? Brian, Brian Connor. Brian, Brian - Don't know him. What does he look like? Is he ugly? Yes, as ugly as yours. Listen to you, are you crazy? What can I get you? I'll have a coke. Nothing, thanks. Where did you pick him up? We started chatting at the Hollywood last night. Wow, and what's the catch? No catch. He's good looking. He's got charm and actually everything a man would need. I think I've already fallen a little in love. He's not a nutcase, like Jurgen with his rainforest trip. What rainforest trip? He was going to walk the Amazon and that sort of crap. That's what he calls a vacation. And he's also got pet tarantulas and other weird stuff. Yes, alright. He was a little strange. -Well, than make sure you don't do anything just yet.- Yes, I'll try. Call me tomorrow and tell me how it went. I will, but I have to go now. Well, I'll keep my fingers crossed. See ya. Thanks, I'll need it. See you. OK, bye.. Bye -See ya.- Jesus, that was funny. It almost killed us. She turned all red. I've never seen someone turn that red before. And here's the best part... ...she turned around to leave... ...and she slipped on the stupid sausage. We died laughing. I spent 5 years there, mostly doing stupid things. Ah, so that's what you learned in school. Thats education for you. And you? Would you like another coke? Yes, please. One coke, please. It will be right there. Yes, I know I might sound a little cunning but you are really very beautiful. Please, don't say anything now. I don't want to hear any comments. It has been a magnificent night. I mean, it was really nice to dine with you. I would like it to remain so for tonight. I hope you're not angry with me. Your coke, ma'am. Thank you. So, what about your family? What do they do? My family was killed many years ago. I just hope that something like that will never happen to my family. You've already got a family? No, no - I mean my brother, my sister, my parents. Right, OK, I thought for a moment that that was an indirect answer to my question. Do you know what I'd like to know? Do you try to get all the girls this way? I mean, the way you do it with me. No, actually I don't do that at all, aside from invite her to dinner. Did you enjoy your meal? Oh yes, it was great. Could we have the check, please. Right Away. I think it's better if we get off to a slow start. I'll call you tomorrow, OK. Well, I think that's the best idea. Call me tomorrow, OK No, I'll still drive you home. OK What do you do? I work in a clinic. Oh, only wondering...are you a doctor? Not quite yet, but soon. You're next! No, Grandpa, no! What's wrong? Nothing I only... Are you OK? No...Yes. I'm out of cigarettes. I'm going to go get some. We interrupt our program for a special announcement. Cliff Parker has escaped from a psychiatric clinic in Haar. Cliff Parker is 25 years old, slim, 5 feet At the moment, Parker should be traveling in a stolen red Golf GTI, with the license number... FFB-N7443 Warning. Cliff Parker is armed and dangerous. -Oh Shit- Stop, stop, stop! You bitch! Do you feel lucky tonight? Get in. How do you like it? This way. Get going. It's been green forever. Thanks. Thanks a lot. Hi. You're back already? Your keys. He was able to escape after murdering 2 doctors and wounding 3 wardens. Since then, 3 cars have been reported stolen and 3 other persons have been brutally murdered. Who has seen Cliff Parker or one of the stolen vehicles. -Oh, my God.- Oh shit, another nut. Oh man, nothing but the same shit on TV again tonight. Hey Linda, What are doing over there? Oh, hi Julia, you're home already? It's not even nine yet. I just felt like coming home. What are you doing tonight. Are you going to Jake's? Yeah, I'm staying the night. Everything still OK between you and Jake? Sure, why do you ask? No reason. You mean, because up till now you've only been out with weird guys. Oh yes. Maybe you're right. A whole bunch of crazy guys. I don't think I'll ever find the right one. Oh, stop it. Stop talking like that. I think you will. Oh no, my wallet. He knows where I live! I have to tell them. Julia, Julia You've got the wrong friends. I think it was a stupid idea for you to lock yourself in there. The door is made of glass. Go away. Just go away. -Julia, do you hear me? Hello?- To bad I have to break it down and chop off your sweet little head. Julia, you stupid bitch! How do you like her now? I played with her a little bit. I think she loved it. Gary, Gary, help me! Help me Gary! Gary help me!. No, don't come in the house! What's wrong with you? Are you crazy? Julie, you've lost something. Let's start over from the beginning. I don't want to ruin our relationship OK I want you to listen to me. Do you understand? I know where you're from. They're looking for you everywhere. I know where you're from. They're looking for you everywhere. Did I ever ask you where you from? I don't give a shit what they say about me on the radio or TV or what they write about me in the paper. I want to live like everyone does. I want to be accepted. Nobody has ever taken me serious in my entire god damn life. Abosolutely no one. The only people I could ever talk to was some wasted shrink and my mother. I could talk to her. She was the only one who ever understood me. But one night my grandfather killed her before my eyes. You're next! No, Grandpa, no! What do you want from me? I want you to marry me and be my wife. I want to live like everyone else. Julia, I want to have kids with you. I want to penetrate you. I want you to absorb all my love juice. I will not allow anything to seperate us. Julia, I love you. My Julia. I really love you more than anything else, my Julia. You killed them all. No. I didn't kill your family. I freed them. Just freed them. They didn't love each other anymore and they probably would have come between us. Julia. You kill people and you want to be loved for that?! You're sick, real sick! Oh no, now it's time for a little lesson. You slut. You didn't understand a thing. Does you mother know what's inside of you? Does she know how false you are deep inside? How superficial you are? I will show you. She'll be very disappointed. Bad girl. Such a filthy soul. You're destroying my dreams. Your a stupid bitch. You just have no feeling for romance. Swallow this! Slut! you stupid slut! OK you slut. This is it. Hey asshole. I'm a cop. This son of a bitch threw a head on my car. I'm sorry I couldn't find you sooner. He left his car somewhere else but I saw the door open, so I thought I better check to see if everything... ...was OK. And that's when I saw all of this. My God. Try to relax. I've already called an ambulance. Take it easy. It'll be OK. Hurry up get this stuff out of here. No one needs to see this anymore. Step back, step back please. There's nothing to see here. I've never seen anything like it in my entire career. Something like this has never happened to me. He slaughtered the girl's entire family. Have you been inside yet? Just check out the apartment, how it looks inside. It's all full of blood and dimembered body parts. He chopped them all up in there. It's unbelieveable. Get out of here! He just chopped off the head. Yes, he chopped it off. Just like that and threw it on his car. The girl is alone now. Yeah... -a total psycho.- Everything OK? Are you OK now? Stop it! I don't want to hear anymore of your stupid stories! You're going to listen to the next story too. I'm here to babysit you. Now, you are going to do what I want just like I always have to do the shit you want! Anyways, don't you think that these are the best bedtime stories ever? OK, the second story is called... THE PURITY. Well then, I'll be on my way. But don't forget to give me those recipes. Yes. They're very good. -Yes, yes - You'll get them...- ...and the knitting patterns. I still need them for myself. But when I'm done... Bye then. See you later. You are the Purity, the pure light. ...and now you are wandering through the darkness. My devoted staff ease thyself. I am the resurrection and the life: He that believed in me... ...though he were dead, yet shall he live. John 11, 25 So I ask you today, my dear parish, Should death not be excepted as the will of God. Of course it grieves us when one of our fellow man,... ...a girl like Abel Farror, whom we all loved, leaves this way. So I charge against the abuse of God's commandment. You shall not kill but this is not a violation against all commandments. A violation against the commandment of brotherly love. ...yes, actually against all commandments of our Lord... ...and so we continue asking ourselves the question... What goes on in a person when he takes the life of a brother or sister? One thing is certain, one day a person must face the Lord with this question. How can one love such a person? How can we serve the way of the Lord? Love those who hate thee, bless those who damn thee, and pray for those who offend thee. Often, the Lord burdens us with difficult trials which are hard to withstand. So the soul is willing, but the flesh is weak. Now we ask our father in prayer to give us bravery and strength. Holy Father who art in heaven hollowed by thy name, thy kingdom come Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread and forgive us our sins... ...as we forgive those who sin against us. Lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from it. Watch out you bastard. We'll get you. We'll beat the hell out of you. It's always been like that. They've never liked me. No, no Justuz. That's not the way to look at it. Yes I know. But I'm frightened. They all blame me for what happened. You shall always love your enemies, just like Jesus did. What should I do? You know that, I have no one. No one will help me. I think, they might want to harm me... My son, the one that will harm you, by God, he will suffer forever in Hell. Praise the Lord. Well, until later. Maybe I could come by for some tea. Here's your tea. Drink it, it will do you good. You know what's funny? What's funny? To die, that we all have to die one day. Oh, what's strange about that, Justuz? Take a look at the trees or the birds or the beetles. God has created everything to take it back to him one day. Who are we to question his plans. We live, we die and we return. What about the people killed like Elvira, Abel and all the others? They too live with God now. They have a better life now. I believe, I've got to go to God soon. Why do you think you have to die? You're young and still have life ahead of you. You know why. No, no - not because of Frank and the others. They're just trouble makers. They're just cowards. It's not only them, it's the old folks too. Since all the killings happened, things have changed. They're looking for someone to blame. Do you know, what will happen to the damned in Hell? No. You can't imagine it, it's so horrific, to imagine it. They will be tortured, pulled apart alive and chopped to pieces. They will never be able to die! Yes! I'm going to go now, you know, lots of work on the farm. Yes, indeed, go ahead. Have a safe trip home. - Goodbye. - Take a look at what's going on out there. Anybody there? Anybody there? You? Yes, me. I need your wife. She is the way to heavenly bliss. Erwin, say something. What's going on down there? Dying is a cleansing process. It purifies the soul. Erwin, speak to me. You are purified. If I had a wife. Who's there? Hurry up, I got the bastard. Let go of me! I didn't do anything! I'll kill you! You're responsible for the dead girls. Stop it! That's enough! Come on. lets go. I want to see you all in church Sunday. Does it still hurt? No, no it's alright. I'm responsible for everything, just as I said before. I've had serious words with Frank. He will be punished for what he did. Now, that fall is near, you still have a lot of work to do, don't you? Surely the farm creates a lot of work? Yes, quite a lot. It's not easy when your alone. Well, yes. Without a wife it never ends. -Well, you can do it... - Now you can barely see it. Thank you, it hardly hurts now. Ralf, I've got to talk to you. Wait, I'll come out... My son, I want you to become a priest. Where did you come from? Straight from Hell! I accuse you Jehova, in the name of my God Lucifer, and pour the pain of my true Father... ...over you and the kin of your earthly followers. So, all those who serve in the name of the self called false God will be released and... ...be welcomed into my heavenly kingdom. Ralf, come to me and rescue your soul. Yes Father, I'm coming. I will rescue my soul. We all know who did it. - Shut up! - We've got to kill him now! That bastard's finished. Kill him off, the pig! Justuz! Eh, yes? Justuz, You've got to get away from here! Why? They are going to kill you! I overheard them at the pub. They talked about it! But, I have done nothing! I know, but they believe that you have. They balme you for the killings.. You have to go into hiding. You should go now. The work. I have to do work on my farm. They mustn't see you at the village anymore. You have to go into hiding until everything... ...settles down a little. Look after yourself, OK. -Yeah- You're in deep shit! Help, help! Hey Frankie, Did you do it? Did you do it? Yes, yes - damn it. It's done! Where is he now? In the garden. I left him there. That's not my job. What about the police? What if someone calls the cops? Ah, nobody will call the cops. Everyone is in on it. No one will say a word. Nobody can... ...say anything. No, nothing at all. They are all quilty. No, they can't. All of you asked for it and I did it! I get my money. Is that clear! Do you think we did the right thing? Of course it was the right thing. Now get out of here. I don't want anything else from you. Leave me alone. May God be with you. My son, he who harms you by God he will burn in Hell! Justuz, wake up! Yes, the kingdom of pain has come for you! You have the ultimate pleasure, never having to die again. You will cross the barrier of all imaginable human pain. Where pain will cease to exist, a new life begins. Welcome to Hell! My son, you have paved your way into the kingdom of immortality. All of your suffering shall be taken from you. Justuz come... Sleep now, little one.
