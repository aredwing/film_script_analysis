What are you feeling? Best. Much better. Is much for me, Grigory Is it the responsibility of my destitucin? The Empress has come this morning... and again gave the order to dismiss. - And I tied ropes. - Very well. It's true she's been here today. You wouldn't have cured even the headache. - Imaginations. - I agree. But I have cured the headache imaginary. And you had advised her to sack me. Before you go I want you to meet someone. Boris! Leave these disgusting concoctions and see! I Introduce your successor, Dr. Boris Zargo. Zargo. I know that name. I'm very busy. It was involved in a scandal? He forbade the practice of medicine. - When the Tsarina know! - She knows. I always thought I was an idiot. - Now I know who is crazy. - Doctor Siglov! You're is speaking of the Imperial Majesty. Take care... or lose something more precious than your work. Beware, if you can lose more than your load. Offend too many people, maybe someone becomes violent. Rasputin uses the Tsarina for his own purposes. He puts it in his pocket. Don't stop until he was dominated. And I'll finish with her and all of us. Unless we do crasions before. You're not serious. In my life I have spoken so seriously. Speak of murder? - Murder. - Whatever. - Not the same. - For me yes. I understand that you refuse. Of course. Coward! If you were out on your nerves, you would make it out. Sonia is the real problem. - She has slept with him. - Everyone knows that! She makes no secret of her actions. What do you want? I wanted to be with you. Is it strange? It's boring. What have I done? See, you did what you had. I don't want to see you more! - Go on, don't make me sick! - I disgust myself. What do you want from me? - What should I do? - I'll tell you what to do, Smallest! Get me to your beautiful girlfriend, Vanessa. Demon! Demon! I'll kill you, demon! I'll kill you! I'll kill you! Demon! Go home! I'll kill you! I'll kill you! I'll kill you! I'll kill you! Man! It's acidic. Wanted to kill me? Kill me! - Look at me! - No! Look at me! Do exactly what I say. Here you are. You will want to kill yourself. Grigory, no! Do you understand? You'll go... and you'll kill yourself! Where are you going, Boris? Away from you. Anywhere. So, dear Boris wants to leave me... - After all you've done! - Stay away. No need to go behind you! - I can kill you any time. - You're crazy Rasputin, understand? - You're crazy. - Me? No, Boris. It is you who are crazy if you think you can do without me. You'll come back crawling. If not, I will end you. I find you and smash! Peter! My God. - Are you better? - Same. - What do we do Here? - It was you who wanted to come. - Do you remember the last time? - Forget it. We were here. And they were there. - I'll kill him... - Do nothing, sit! Hey you! - Where is your friend? - Shut up. Can we talk a minute? - You are not drunk! - Peter! I've been drinking, but just enough to understand things... and see what to do with Rasputin. I understand your feelings, but this is important. - We have to take this? - Let's close! I must speak with you. Can go somewhere? Please. Alright. My house. He controlled the Tsarina. Under hypnosis will do everything he wants. Understand? We must kill him! - I said! - I don't speak for myself. I died long ago. What do you want? Mean to kill him? Yeah, I mean he must be killed. - I can not participate. - Not asking you to remove it. I myself will do it. What I ask is that... You must forgive me for saying this. but he has attracted your sister. - Vanessa! She hates him. - He did not imagine it. Go see him, I'll tell you what to say. If you use the name of it to attract a date, will come, and I will not leave you alone. Do it, by Sonia. Yeah. Poor little Sonia Why "poor little Sonia"? She... What? What have you done? Tonight he... has told her to kill herself. Peter! Sonia! Sonia! Sonia! My God! He told her to commit suicide. Rasputin! Rasputin!, Salt, demon! I know you're there. Here I am, Peter Vassilievich. Here I am. What you want from me, Pequeo Peter? My sister is dead. You killed her. I an very clever. I have not even touched her. You tell her to commit suicide. Orders fulfilled, what a good girl. Poor little Peter. Scared in the dark. Watch out, Peter. Acids are stored here. Good morning. My name is Ivan Kolesnikov. We know each other, but we haven't presented. I do not bother you? - Yes. - I will not waste much time. What do you want? This is lovely, as I described for Vanessa. - Vanessa? - My sister, the Tsarina's lady. But you already know that. Can we go there? What gorgeous! is very nice! Why are you here? For the sake of the two, I hope. You can't do anything for me. Right? I should go then? Say what you have to say. I fully understand my sister. She keeps telling me... how much she like you. She barely speaks of nothing else, could be said... who complains too much of you. Continue... You can do something for me. But, wouldn't have come. Why do you think your sister would want? She notices, What gorgeous! I'm a military and promotion is slow. There is a vacancy at the Embassy of Paris, and I want it. I know you have a lot of influence on the Tsarina. She might help. Thank you. My gratitude will know no bounds. To keep up appearances, She will not come here. But in our house is a very nice apartment, away from home. In the past it was an ideal place for special guests. My carriage will come looking for you today at 10. - I thought that he was. - Oh, no. We will hear the carriage. Is a tragn! Can not resist this. Do not touch it, is also poisoned. Offends his label? Prefer rather play down to a pistol duel? Sorry. - Know anything about your friend? - No. Nobody has seen him since I found Sonia's body. - Sure you want to? - Yes. I have to. Is it him? Yes, hurry. Good night. Here. So don't go through the house. Here. It is very opulent, but it's nice. And she? It is intended that the lady is already here. But because of her vanity you must wait ten minutes. Ah, yes, the wine. I know you likes sweet. Try to hurry. Peter! Don't... ...touch me. How did it happen? Ras... putin. It was Rasputin? Will never die! He is the devil! I've tried, but doesn't die! Dude! Help! He's dead. Boris. He...
