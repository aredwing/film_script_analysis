Gosh, then you won't know anything about what goes on outside. Hey kid. That old man isn't your grandfather, is he? You two just sleep? Why'd you dress so light? Yeah. Did you know that old man's gonna marry that girl when she turns 17? What a rotten thief. I bet they cuddle up all night. Don't look. An arrow will pierce your eye. Oh yeah, I heard he tells fortunes. - Fortunes? - Yeah! What kind of fortunes? Old man, tell me my fortune. My wife's been fishy lately, and nothing's working out for me. What lunatic reads fortunes that way? You're right. What? Fuck this! Why? Is your wife cheating? Old man, what you said was true? - I'm asking you if it's true? - What did he say? For someone who traps a kid on a boat, what does he know about fortunes? You were kidding, right? Think he'd kid around after risking that girl's life to tell your fortune? So what did he say? Wedding Day It's tiny. Try catching one of these at least. Go sit over there. One, two, three. Take a look. Hey you, come here. Come sit here, hurry. This is you. You came out better than I thought. Hey, are you living with that old man? You're really pretty. Stay still. I'll grab it for you. Hold this. I'll look for it. Now hold still. - Get out of there! - Where could it be? I'll grab it for you. Hey, I'll find it! Let's see, where could it be? Could it be here? Asshole. Come here. Will it be okay? Shit, we're the only ones here. Old man, don't you think you were too harsh on us? - She's not there? - No. Go in. She's not here. See if there's a way out. How old are you? Have you been to Seoul? You'd probably be in high school. You just lived on this boat? Aren't you lonely? Is that old man your grandfather? Dad. Is that girl his granddaughter? No, he found her when she was six. Gosh, it's been ten years already. Then she lived on this boat for ten years? And she never left? I think so. How could he do that to her? He's a bad person. Old man! My business isn't doing so well lately. Could you tell me my fortune? Isn't this too dangerous? What if she gets hit? He wasn't a mute? What did he say? Why are you laughing? What did he say? What are you doing? I didn't touch her! What's with you, old man? Have you thought from her perspective? Ever considered how'd she feel living on a boat for ten years? Don't confine that girl anymore just because of your selfish greed. I'm gonna find that girl's parents and come back for sure. Wedding Day Is that old man crazy? Asshole... What the hell? Asshole... - What the hell... - Are you crazy? We paid to come here, so how could you run us out now? - Hey old man! - Just leave it alone. I said let's go! I said let's go! Who the hell said to come here? Her parents are looking for her. You have to leave here now. I know it hurts to leave him after he raised you for ten years, but you have to see the world. What gives a kidnapper the right to hit her? Ever considered her parents, who've looked for her for ten years? Because of your vile desires you've destroyed a human being's life! You're a demon for ruining this girl's life! Tell me my fortune, too. I want to know whether I'll leave with this girl, or whether you'll marry her and live happily. You're scared, aren't you? I'll leave tomorrow morning. Please let her go. She has to see what's out there. Are you OK?
