So you've chosen to swindle your big brother, you idiot. You're doomed! You're a first class man, but the gun in your hand is third class. Go ahead, shoot. l'll be fine. This will fire, but something else will blow up. What! What else will blow up? This pistol is made in Muradabad. lt still looks brand new... lt'll explode alright! But think of what can happen. lf you don't believe me, try it out. What're you saying? l bought it for 15000 rupees... And not from Muradabad, from Ghaziabad. l wouldn't pay 1500 rupees for this! And l wouldn't use this to recover dues worth 150,000 rupees! You want to see what a real pistol looks like? Look at this. This is a point 38 revolver. lf you'd have this, we wouldn't have to sweat it out in a chase. You could have shot me from afar, and l'd be dead by now. You wouldn't even need to aim. This is an automatic. lt looks like good stuff. How much is it for? Not too much. Just 20000 more than the money taken. What? Okay fine, l'll give you a discount. Take it for 10000. All dues settled. Be careful, and don't shoot. Why not? You won't need to. Just show it and the job's done. How can you shoot without bullets? Now l've just played you. The real play will come later! Brother, you're here?! l've been looking all over Delhi for you. So where else will you look for Sonu Dilli? ln Dubai? And whenever l'm in trouble, you disappear. What else should l do, brother? We're partners in business, not in death. You know how scared l am of dying. Still you keep getting me into trouble. l also save your neck, don't l? Yes you do. But why do you go out looking for death every day? Well, we encounter risks in this business... and whenever we do, we get something good out of it. So give me my 2000 rupees now. You are some partner! You only know how to take. Learn to give something! Wait a while. l'll return every penny. lt's been a long time since l've taken my girl Pooja out. Give me the money. l'll take it back, with interest. Don't forget! Yes, yes. With interest. Your nick name's perfect for you. Sonu Dilli KKC... You cheeky rogue. He was right, the rascal. People gave me that nick name. l don't know who named me Sonu. My aunt called me 'cheeky' since my childhood. And l earned the 'rogue' title on my own. l made a lot of money... but spent most of it for my pleasure. When you're thirsty, you've got to go to the well. l quench my thirst, ljust don't take it home. The business of guns is booming in lndia today. And always will be. Because nowadays, people's anger is rising. And they derive pleasure from seeing others in pain. lf they don't have a gun, they'll knife each other. Or they'll use sticks. But they'll kill for sure. So if they have to kill, why not with guns? That's why l sell guns. And make money. Every rogue wants a gun nowadays. Thieves, contractors, doctors, engineers... ministers, peons, everybody. Those who can't buy guns, rent them. Whether for a day, or a month... they get status, l get money. That's why l sell them to everyone, guns, revolvers, rifles, pistols. l'm not doing anything wrong. lf everyone has a gun, all will be equal. And the day everyone is equal... society's problems will be solved. So by selling guns to everyone, society's problems are solved by... Sonu Dilli KKC. The cheeky rogue. What's this, sir? Why are you always trying to kill yourself? This is my effort to keep myself alert and alive. lt's difficult to understand you. Another piece of bad news. Some boys in Dariya Gunj shot a college girl with a gun. Another slap on the face of the Delhi Police! Come on sir. You play, you sing. You're really one of a kind. Hey, what's this sound? Are you filming me? Are you trying to make a MMS and ruin me? Hey! What's this cold feeling, in the heat of the moment? Who is behind me? Pull up your trousers and come out. lt's urgent. Your brother? This is more urgent. Can't you see l'm busy? lf you don't come out now, l'll shoot you right here. The newspapers won't even print your picture. Don't think this is a threat. Because this gun is legal, and so am l. Sir, if you had told me that you're that famous officer from the Delhi police... l would have come running. l swear l won't ever go back to that hotel, nor ever dream about any girl. And l'm taking this oath when l'm still young! Sir, you're a little too angry. l didn't anything so wrong. ls he a policeman or a mad freak? This is the first policeman l've seen who neither speaks nor listens. What does he want from me? l was so happy with that girl. She thought l was some big shot. But this moron came along and made me look like a loser. lt's okay buddy. You disrespected me in private... l'll do it in public, you mad freak! What? Are you abusing me? Abusing you? No, sir. Why would you think so? Because l was abusing you. And badly. Why did you stop here, sir? Showing me the new flyover? Did you build it? Get out, get some fresh air. Since when have you known Gafoor? Gafoor? l know a few Kapoors. But l haven't met a Gafoor in this lifetime. So should we send you to meet him in the next life? Gafoor is an illegal arms dealer, and you're his seller. Sir, wait a minute, what're you saying? You've got the wrong man. There's been a mistake. l am scared of toy guns. How can l sell real ones? l have a clothes business. l spend my days selling clothes. Kareena Cut Piece is the name of the shop, across the Yamuna river. Come over once, l'll serve you some great tea. Can l go now? Do you see 'moron' written on my face? Sonu Dilli, l know your every move. Then what you know is wrong. Okay take this. Here take 10000 rupees, and let me go. What's with the knife? Are you making me an encounter victim? Why did you slash my hand? You're a crazy policeman! l'll sue you, you watch. All of you. Catch him...catch him. Let me go. Let me go! What are you doing? Throw him down! Let me go. Don't move. Oh shut up. Are we molesting you that you're screaming like a damsel in distress? This is unfair! Help! Help! Help! What're you doing? Why this chain? l'll die. Will you hang me now? You are crazy policemen. You're gangsters, not policemen. Help! l'm bleeding, call an ambulance. Ambulance! Why did you do that? Wait, l'll tell you about Gafoor, l'll tell you about the business. Let me go! Help! So you know Gafoor now? Sir, you've managed to convince me, l swear. Afew hours ago you were shouting with joy. Now how did you cut your hand? l met this madman who wanted to feed me to the fishes. And you could only find this hospital?! lt looks awful! Brother, for this hand with such short notice, this is what you get. You see the doctor here, l'll meet you downstairs. Excuse me. Excuse me, can l go first? l'm bleeding here. Let's hope l don't have AlDS. Thank you. What happened to you? Oh wow! She's breathtaking! ls she a doctor or a magician? My hand was wounded, and now it's my heart. She's a doctor. She won't let me die. And l know how to survive. A perfect situation! Hello! l'm talking to you. Oh...yes. lt's... this little cut on my hand. You call that little? lt looks like someone did it on purpose. Must be you. Were you thinking of suicide? You're right. lt was done on purpose. l can't lie to you. A policeman mistook me for someone else. He cut my hand and hung me upside down from a bridge. l now know how dangerous all these new bridges are. Does it pain? lt was earlier. Not anymore. And now? Not at all. What's your name? S.D. S.D.? Sanjay Dutt? Sunil Dhariwal. Sunil... l'm giving you a prescription... You'll be fine in a couple of days. You won't need to come back again. l don't mind coming back. l'll come wheneveryou say. You have so much free time? Well, l don't. l do treat for free, but l'm not free all the time. You can go now. But what about the other hand. The other hand? lt's fine. lt isn't fine. See the cut. Look. Mr. Banwari... stop watching cartoons on TV, and come meet a real one here. Excuse me... Hold it tight. lf you bleed too much, you could die. Where did l tell you to hit, and where are you hitting? Sorry, sorry. Can't you hit better, you fool? Sorry, sorry. lt was a mistake, l didn't meant to hit you so hard. Why do you want to get beaten up anyway? What's wrong? Balli, l'm in love! What? ln love? Stop fooling around with me. lf a cat says it's stopped eating mice, l'd believe that. But if Sonu Dilli says this, l can't believe it. l'm serious, Balli. There's something about her eyes, her touch. l felt good with her. What are you saying? You won't understand. Go on, hit me. No problem even if you break my bones. She's a doctor, she'll fix me. Just spare my eyes. How will l look at her then? You've gone mad, totally. You've lost your senses. My senses, my peace, my heart... they are all with her. Your delicate smile and then your leaving Your delicate smile and then your leaving fate has given me a chance l saw a glimpse of you my first love for the first time for this heart without making promises who knows what happened to this heart? l met you, and my prayers were answered And my eyes worshipped you heaven has kissed the earth happiness has gently touched me every look is heavenly you are everywhere you have amazing qualities l saw a glimpse of you my first love for the first time for this heart without making promises who knows what happened to this heart? l was lonely every moment without you my lips were parched l had no purpose, no dreams my life was aimless you are the one merciful to me you are my path and my destiny you are like my gift from the Lord l saw a glimpse of you my first love for the first time for this heart without making promises who knows what happened to this heart? How do l look? Good. Very nice. This guy, he'll never change. Brother, l don't understand one thing. ln the age of mobile phones... who is Raghuvanshi sir calling from that booth, using those coins? There are situations in life through which a person survives... but life is never the same. He often calls that number to listen to the voice of his dead wife. ''Hi. You've reached Meera and Pratap.'' ''We are not at home right now. Please leave a message after the beep, and we'll call you back.'' What? You're kidding right? No. lt's true. Once he was travelling with his wife in a bus. Some gangsters attacked the bus. ln that incident his wife was killed. He survived with a bullet in his head... which is still there. Since that day, he is on a personal vendetta to eradicate the illegal guns trade. Since then, he often listens to his dead wife's voice this way. What are you saying? l'm telling you the truth. ls it? He's coming. Sir, filter, filter... filter. Where is he? Who? Sonu Dilli. Sonu? He's our biggest lead to get to Gafoor. He's just a pawn in the illegal guns trade. Why are you after him? Pawn or king, he'll get us to Gafoor. lf he has to die after that, let him. Hey! ls this any place to meet someone? There's a sofa, bed, chair... couldn't you wait there? Why do you always appear when my pants are down? Because l want to get you, scoundrel. You dared to cut my call? Do that again, and l'll slice you right through. Small time supplier... if you don't mend your ways you'll be in trouble as long as you live. You promised to get me to Gafoor right? l've come to remind you. Do you understand? l will when you get the gun off me. You always point the gun where you shouldn't. Now can l relieve myself? Hurry up. You don't have much time. Call Gafoor and set up a deal. You scoundrel, have you understood everything? You get Gafoor out in the open. Let us get a good look at him, then you do your deal and get lost. Leave the rest to us. He's coming for sure right? lf he isn't, you're dead meat. Scolding instead of praise? l'm helping you, putting my life and work at stake. lf the deal happens, he'll come. Have some faith. -What a nuisance! -You... You think Sonu Dilli's a fool, Pratap Raghuvanshi? You'll see! l'll put you in such a mess... you'll long for salvation but... all you'll get is a sweet death. What's the matter Sonu Sir? Seems like you're selling guns by the kilo, like a grocer. l'd supplied you just two weeks ago. Gafoor sir, the wedding season's almost here. Demand's gone up. You know how it is... until a gun is fired, the wedding ritual isn't complete. That's true. But l can't supply at such short notice. - That's clear. - Okay. What's the matter? Your veins are bulging. ls something wrong? When you take up things that make them bulge, they do. - The tea was good. -Yes it was. They were supposed to come later. Where did these two losers come from? You get the car, where did those cops come from? Gafoor sir, go that way. Who informed the police? Did you inform them? l swear l didn't. Then no problem. Just get me out of here. Go that way. Hey you, wait! Get the car and meet me there, hurry... Hey you, stop! Hey you, stop! Where did he go? Hey! How dare you enter a ladies washroom? Sir... Back down. Be careful, he's got a pistol. lt's eitheryou or me. Hey stop! Catch him. Oh, sorry, sorry. Hello. You remember me, don't you? How could l forget? You don't often meet people who deliberately cut their hand. l thought you'd be thinking about me. Remembering you, isn't the same as thinking about you. You must be thinking about me sometimes at least? By the way, why're you here, in this situation? What situation? Auto. Didn't you see? l was running. Yes l saw that. But why were you running? When the police chase people, they run. Police? l told you about the officer who mistook me for someone else? He still does. Why don't you complain to a higher authority? l was just on my way to complain... but why're you here? Any special reason? l'm trying to gather funds for that hospital of mine. So far, l've been treating people like you for free. This fund raising is to make sure that can continue. ls that it? l'll raise the funds for you. You will? How? By robbing a bank? Do you think l'm a thief? l own a clothing business. l have a lot of contacts, who are generous like me. They'll get you the funds in a jiffy. Give me your number. l'll contact you after speaking with my contacts. Listen, l don't give my number away like this... but l will give it to you... See if you can help me. There he is. l'm serious. The hospital needs to be saved. Come on! Hey you, wait! Stop waving your hand. l'm not waving, l'm surrendering. With your back to us? Stop fooling us, come on. Why're you arresting me? l'm working for the police. -What? You're working for the police? - Call Raghuvanshi. He'll explain. Shall l call the PM as well? Listen to me, my card... What do you think you're doing? This is my effort to keep myself alert and alive. No, you're trying to get yourself and everyone else killed. Have you looked at yourself lately? Seriously... you need a break. l'm giving you one. Go on, go home. Get some sleep. Sir, what do you mean? l mean, this time you've crossed the line. You did a sting operation on Gafoor, without any proof against him. Sit down. Only on a hunch... you created chaos in a public place and didn't even inform me. Pratap, l protect you... because l know we need determined and staunch policemen like you. But this time, there's been too much trouble. We need to divert the attention of media and ministry. l'm sorry. l'am forced to take a decision to suspend you. What? Relax, relax. l will reinstate you. But this time l don't have a choice. l'm here, don't worry. But the dealer is dead. Shut the case and move on. And that boy who was arrested... what is his name... Sonu? We'll charge him. He'll be locked up for a few years. Everything will calm down in 3-4 months. Then everything will be fine. Nothing will be fine Sir. Gafoor is a small time dealer Sir. There's someone bigger who controls this illegal arms racket. Praise be to almighty lord The all powerful and supreme Give us strength and courage to flourish in our business Brothers... if today you can make guns, pistols and revolvers from these ordinary items here... that's only because you inherited the skills from your ancestors. This is but a boon. lf it weren't for those cowardly kings who surrendered to the British! Otherwise, the Chinese... Russians and the Americans would all be using our weapons today. And they still can. For sure. And this... this revolver is that guarantee... which was made by this man within hours. Look. This revolver is as good as any foreign make. l am proud of you. l want to kiss your hands. Give. Sir... And now... l'll have to get rid of them. Because if anyone else uses the skills in these hands then... l won't like it... and l can't take a risk on that. No, sir. l'll always be loyal to you. You can't guarantee that. Everyone has a price. l have seen greed in your eyes. No, sir! No! No, sir! No! Sir, do take a little care of yourself. You're here to preach? No, sir. l'm here to remind you that Sonu's court hearing is in the morning... unless we reach the court on time, he'll be released on bail. Come. Tomorrow, l won't go to court, nor will you, or the lawyer. What do you mean? Sonu Dilli has to come out of prison. Only if he does, will our plan work. Have you come to pick up Sonu Dilli from prison or to pick up a kid from school? What did you do with the Honda City? Brother, everything's gone. l gave away the car to the lawyer to get you out of here. l sold the house to pay the public prosecutor to hear me out. l sold the shop to pay for the appeal to the judge. Now let's go. This is the first time that l feel like crying out loud. But l won't cry. l'll make others cry. Especially Raghuvanshi. You wait and watch. For now, just arrange for me to bathe and eat. Come on. What are you staring at? My luck's cursed anyway. You want to curse my meals as well? Not just me, everyone's staring. Look at how you're eating. The chicken's cooked, it isn't going to run away. Forget about everyone else. They don't know that l'm just out of prison. That's right. What happened? So she's the one who got you into trouble that day? Quite a looker! You idiot, you shouldn't be checking out your future sister-in-law. l'll whack you. Sister-in-law? But the chicken leg's falling out of your mouth. How're you going to walk up to that girl like that? l mean, my future sister-in-law... brother! That's what l'm thinking. l'll go and meet her? Yes sure! Am l looking okay? You definitely don't look like you just got out of prison. ls something out here? Hello! We seem to be bumping into each other often nowadays. Nowadays? lt's been 5-6 months since we last met. And you were going to contact me, right? But you disappeared. l didn't disappear. l was in prison. Oh. Prison. Okay. Yes, to meet the bigshots, for your fund. And did you get the funds? No? l didn't expect too much from you anyway. But don't worry, the hospital still survived. Come by some time. Your treatment will still be free. You're mocking me? l'll gather the funds and show you. Listen, l'm saying this with a lot of thought, so try to understand. Don't get furious. l'll raise funds because you are doing a good thing. And also because... l'm not flirting. l'm falling in love with you. What? l said it to her, and you all are shocked. l'll see you soon with the funds. He's crazy. Don't take him seriously. They don't have to, you have to take me seriously. Me, and what l said. Drowned in your love l remain night and day May your dreams never leave my eyes May you write my name on your palms, always May the Lord bring me that day You are mine... You are mine... You are mine... You are mine... You are mine... You are mine... You are mine... You are mine... You are mine... You are mine... You are mine... You are mine... You are mine... You are mine... Your love is my need l love you, My world is quiet without you l won't be able to stay away from these My heaven are your paths Your love is my need l love you, My world is quiet without you l won't be able to stay away from these My heaven are your paths With that hope in my heart l live that we meet and you will say You are mine... You are mine... You are mine... You are mine... You are mine... You are mine... You are mine... You are mine... Sir, if you will, let's nab him. No, buddy. Let him float in the clouds of love... we'll place our wager when the time is right. You are my destiny You are my compassion All my joys are one with you You are my love You are my respite l love your simplicity You are my destiny You are my compassion All my joys are one with you You are my love You are my respite l love your simplicity l find myself lonely, every moment away from you Hold me, Stop me l am lost. You are mine... You are mine... You are mine... You are mine... You are mine... You are mine... You are mine... You are mine... You are mine... You are mine... You are mine... You are mine... You are mine... You are mine... We watched a movie, ate samosas, held hands... now it's time to kiss, according to every love story. Think about it. l'll talk to you later. Look, if it isn't the right time to kiss yet, l'm sorry. l really am. l have no wrong intentions. Sunil, what's going on between us... l don't know if it's right or wrong. l don't know if l'm in love with you or ljust like you. But l like being around you, even your slap. Because there's a certain unique truth about you. Maybe l should've figured out before as to what's true and what isn't. But you didn't leave me much time for thinking. Then let's get married. Then we will figure out what to do later. Married? So as peryour calculation, after kissing comes marriage? But marriage isn't a calculation for me. Besides... l don't know why l am afraid of being around you. l live in truth and reality, l hate cheats, their lies... l have a simple life and small dreams... that's why l left home and cut all ties with my father. l built a life for myself on my own terms. l've built my life on my own too. We'll make a perfect couple. Still, we're different. Look, l don't understand philosophy. We're different now... ls there any chance of becoming one? One in a million. That's enough. Look, from now on call me Sonu... My friends calls me Sonu, lovingly. You call me that too. l understand that you need a simple, homely, decent man. l will become that for you. You'll see. See you later. Brother, l don't understand what you're saying. Yesterday you said it was love... today you've even discussed marriage. So go ahead and do it. Who's stopping you? Balli, l should've led a honest life right from the start. Honest life? You'd be munching leftovers sitting outside a temple. Sir, it's Salman Khan's movie. Will you only talk, or even do some work today? Balli, l've been hustling people with my words so far... today her words have put me in a tizzy. l swear, l feel like such a rogue today. Felt like it today? Don't laugh. l'm serious. Balli, she always believed what l told her. l lied even about my name. Balli, l want to get out of this mess. l want to be a good man, with a respectable business. l want to buy a small house, and have the right sort of friends, not like you. Oh really?! So because of this girl l'm not the right sort of friend? Don't call her just another girl, that hurts me. l mean, l want to introduce her to some decent people... if she meets you she'll figure out my whole history. Do you understand? Your phone is ringing. My phone? Raghuvanshi? What a nuisance! ''The numberyou are trying to reach is currently unavailable.'' Take the DVD's and get lost. Take the shop and get lost. Get going! Sonu Dilli, you cut my call again? You've forgotten me so soon? Yes, as if you kept thinking of me. You sent me to prison for no reason and didn't even come to see me. This is what l get for helping you? Why so upset? Come on, l'll fix this. Get in the car. l don't want to go. l've changed now, Ask around. l know. But you can still talk to me. You're a good man. You've mended your ways too. l should help you. l will. But l need your help, one more time. This illegal guns syndicate... Shoot me if you will! But l won't do it. l don't want to listen to this anymore. All right... then l'll talk to the one you're in love with. Should l get her here? What? What did you say? Relax. l know everything. She's a doctor right? You dare...! l mean... Listen, she must not know any of this. Don't worry. Not just her, no one will find out. Look, you know how big the illegal gun market is. The head of the syndicate is close by, and there's some huge plan taking shape. You are a gun supplier... okay. You used to be. You can easily slip in undercover as my informer. My work will be done then. And l'll be finished. l won't let that happen. l promise nothing will happen to you this time. You will lead a tension-free life. Just don't tell anyone that you're my informer... for your safety. And you can continue to run your side business. And have a decent, simple life. Then the doctor will be happy and so will you. Think about it, your life will be wonderful. Have a drink and think about it. You do have a point. Jaanvi too wishes for such a life. Okay. l'll play your game, but for my love and happiness. Brother, this party is for the rich and classy. Why are we commoners here? To become big men. l rang Gafoor's driver lrfaan. He invited us here. We'll move higher up in the syndicate now. Higher up in the syndicate? Way to go, buddy! But tell me, yesterday you said... Forget about yesterday. Listen to me now. This kind of opportunity to raise one's status, is given to very few. Great. Even l'm sick of doing these small jobs and always borrowing money from you. Now if money comes in, l can finally pay you back. And besides, l like this 'mosphere' a lot. ''Atmosphere'', man! Come on. You drink a lot nowadays. - Sarfaraz sir, this is Sonu Dilli KKC. - The cheeky rogue. l'm Balli, his right hand. Hand or something else? You've called us here for small talk, Sarfaraz sir? Don't take it so badly. You seem to honour friendship a lot. Not just friendship, every relationship, every promise. That's all well and good... But do you know anything about this business? Or do you just claim to be an honest worker? lf a boss asks me this, then it's okay... but l don't answer such ridiculous questions from lowly assistants. You think l'm a lowly assistant? Whoever agrees for a meeting in 15 minutes can only be a lowly assistant and a stupid one. What did you call me? Stupid? What? 56 bore, lightweight star. lt's come from Pakistan, via Nepal. lt sells for 25000. But l can sell this for 300000. What? This is what l know about the business. There's no paperwork for this. lt's illegal. l'll forge some papers and make it legal... then sell it proudly for as much as you want. Even when looking death in the face, you're talking business. Come, you're a part of our business now. What's the matterJaanvi? Where has your smile gone these days? l don't know. l had one chance at happiness. And l think l lost it. You know what's wrong with you... your fear of your past makes you afraid of your future. Jaanvi, Sonu loves you. Trust him. Come on shake it... shake it momma. Bring on...bring on Bit by bit... You seem a little upset Bit by bit... Drop the reason l am separated only for you Have the heavens ever been destroyed? Just two of us l want to live with the girl of my dream lt's me, and you against this world You're the only love that l breathe...breathe...breathe You're the only love that l need...need...need Nothing ever will come between us Even though l'm from Mars and you're from Venus l appear like a thick fog Whatever l write, why is it erased? those nights, those memories are joining, are breaking every link. This breath, these paths, are paying the price of my crimes Have the heavens ever been destroyed? lf you don't have the money, take all this stuff and get out. l'm trying to arrange for the money. l've given you enough warning. Throw all the stuff out, now! Don't you touch anything. l'm trying to arrange it. Get lost! Trying to scare an innocent girl? So we'll scare you then. Before scaring me, tell me have you seen the movie 'Naam'? No, why? Then we're all set. Listen to me carefully. There are five of you, l'm alone. l can't win against all of you. But l'll tell you this... the first one to hit me... l'll hunt him down and kill him. l swear, l can write that down for you. Let's see who goes first. He's a madman! Listen mate, we have no issues with you. But Rawat sir wants the rent for this place. Now you're making sense. Take the money. l'd saved it for the wedding, but you can take it. Now get going. And don't come back here ever again. l was bluffing about the wedding part. l'd saved that money for your hospital. Now l'll start saving for us. Give me a little time. l'll see you. But, will you give me time? So much that even time will complain. Will you always protect me this way? l would die for you. Will you heed to what l say? Yes, even if you call night day and day night. Then let's get married. What? Did l hearyou right? My ears aren't playing tricks on me? At least congratulate me for my wedding. You can't get married. Why not? Because l'll shoot you. And the doctor will have to marry a corpse then. Only you can say such bad things. Why do you keep scaring me? For the first time l'm in love... for first time l want to give happiness to a girl... and you are out to ruin this joy with your venom. Have you taken an oath to never let me be happy? Our lives are connected by a string now. lf you stretch it too much, you'll fall flat. You can't get married until this operation is over. So until the dog gets it's bone it won't let me cross the road. What? Then listen. The head of the syndicate... Mangal Singh Tomar is coming to Delhi tomorrow. Who? Mangal Singh Tomar. This means that an important deal is coming up. When it happens, l'll tell you. Once l get this gangster Mangal Singh arrested... Then l go my way, and you go yours. There will no string between us. We won't be in touch at all. No 'hello-goodbyes'. Don't even try to come close. Now can l get married? And don't come for the wedding. Now congratulate me. Hello sir! Welcome to Delhi. Please come. Okay. No one else knows that l'm here right? How could anyone find out? You tried to save Gafoor, but couldn't. Sir, one can only try. They say the rest is destiny. l can't figure one thing out. You're working for us... but someone's been trying to harm us too. Sir...harm you? Yes. Some links have been exposed, some people have been arrested. Sir, they were arrested because of their stupidity... l mean, their own fault. l think we'll get along well. You seem to be sharp! You'll do well in our business. You can leave now. Okay. l'll be with Delhi for a while... and with the memory of your face. Okay Sir. Listen, l think my father's found out about our wedding. he's coming here to meet us. But l don't want to meet him. What are you saying? He won't come armed right? No problem, We'll meet him proudly. - Congratulations. - Thank you. Now do l have the right to...? You won't slap me? Here? ln front of everyone? So what! Dad! Oh God, what a surprise gift for the wedding! l still can't believe that the main villain is my wife's father! Why did he have to be Jaanvi's father?! Love at first sight is cruel, l swear. This is like bitter medicine... which l can't spit out, nor can l swallow. l'll just get out of here! Sonu, l've made an account for 80% of the stock. Even if the sales are average, we will have a good profit margin. l don't know much about this business, but my calculations never go wrong. But mine did. Why are you packing suddenly? Are you going somewhere? Not me... us. how can l go for the honeymoon alone? Honeymoon? but we are going next week! Jaanvi... if we wait for a week, it'll be too late. Let's go for our honeymoon now. lf the place is nice, we'll stay there. lt must be good, you picked it out. What's the name? Digha. Yes, it's the perfect time. You start packing too. Sonu, l can't take decisions like you so impulsively. l'll have to take leave from the hospital... and even you have to handle this new stock. So be practical and relax. And by the way, that envelope was delivered for you. Sonu Dilli, you're in big trouble. Sonu, what's the matter? Are you all right? And what's with all that noise? That's the sound of my stomach churning. Do you need a medicine? l need prayers, not medicine. l'm coming. That scoundrel, l'd like to tie him up and burn him... beat him and dance on him. Who are you cursing? Someone is trying to blackmail me... That rogue... once l find him... l'll beat him to pulp, l swear. Go ahead, do it. What?! When l saw your face at the court that day... l knew you were terrified, and you would try to make a run for it. So l thought l'd warn you... don't even think about it. Then don't even imagine that l'll work for you anymore! Really! So you don't want a decent life anymore? lf l won't even stay alive, then what 'decent life' are you talking about! Even if l survive Mangal Singh's sword... l won't be able to save my marriage. lf Jaanvi comes to know... No, no. l can't help you anymore. l have a few more pictures. This time l'll give them straight to her, without an envelope. You're blackmailing me! l had mended my ways. You drew me back in with all the talk of a 'decent life'. And now you are digging my grave? You'll be fine, don't worry. l've promised you that you'll be fine. l guarantee it. Will you also guarantee that you won't die? What if you die and l survive? l'll still be in trouble, like Amitabh Bachchan in Don. l'll be like a homeless dog, with the police chasing me, Mangal looking to kill me... and my wife as well... l'll be in trouble. There! lt's my nemesis calling! Yes, sir. Hello sir. l'm just trying to run away from a mad dog that's chasing me. l'm safe, but he's still around. Yes, l'm on my way. Does Jaanvi know who you are? You ask me questions? Yes, you can, you are Jaanvi's beloved husband now. But tell me, does she know who you are? No. But l know that l love her, beyond measure. And she loves me too. So if you think... l don't know what to think. l don't understand the tricks of destiny. What a mess! What are you going to do now? l'll do whateveryou say. There are just two things l can't do. l can't divorce Jaanvi, and l can't stop loving her. l'm in two minds. The father of the girl wants to give his son-in-law a lot of money... to take her far away and settle down. But the boss of the syndicate wants to... keep a useful man in his team. Now you choose... Here? Or there? Sir, l can't take the money and go away... because Jaanvi won't come. Also, she'll figure out the truth about us if she sees that much money. As for me, l can't live off charity. l earn my own bread. And this is what l'm good at, so l'll do it. Welcome to the family, and the business, son-in-law! Family is an obstacle for the saint, the criminal and the leader. That's why l killed my wife. My business is booming. l want to cast iron using the skills of our ancestors. But once again my family is in my way. lf Jaanvi finds out... Sir, you don't worry about that. Jaanvi... Sonu... What are you doing here? Me? l called him. l knew you wouldn't tell me anything. So l thought l'd get to know him myself. What he does for a living, what... Whatever he does, he's honest and that matters to me. l'll leave... l have to go to the shop. See you at home. Bye. He's a good boy. l thought l'd learn more about his business. Just to check if he can take care of you well. l can take care of myself, you know that well. And now you know that he has a textile business... and you can't help him there at all. Because l wouldn't want you to help him. You called him here today, don't ever do that again. Don't get so worked up. You still haven't changed. Fine, l won't call him here. Happy? You moron, is the deal happening or not? lt isn't some garbage deal that'll get cancelled. lt will happen today. When l find out, l'll tell you. Don't keep calling and scaring me, l'm hanging up. Sir, that was Jaanvi. She knows it's the first big deal, so she's very excited. You've been to Meerut before right? Yes. There's a Begum park near Begum bridge, deal will happen there. Come Tomar sir. Listen, the deal is happening. lt's on the way to Meerut. The guns are in the water tanker, l'm going after them. Okay! Okay, sir. - Hello. - Hello. Hello. lf l snatch your phone ever, l won't give it back, remember that. Hello. What's going on? You didn't answer the phone first, and now who was that? l told you l'm busy. l'll call back. Okay listen, ljust called to tell you to please stay away from my dad. Don't ever meet him. Yes, l'll stay far away. l'm hanging up now. That was your daughter, she was getting worked up because of him. You sound like a thief, she got suspicious. Yeah, as if she knows it well! Sarfaraz, don't do that again. And you... switch off your phone. -Just increase the radio volume. -Yes. Lower the volume. Hello? Greetings sir. One of your men works for the police. Get out of there quick. Forget about the deal. The police have found out. Someone amongst us is an informer... he's given us away. But how can you be so certain that someone amongst us has informed the police? Because a policeman told me so! Stupid rascal. - Sarfaraz... -Yes sir? Turn the tanker around. Okay sir. - Listen... - Sir? Both of Sonu's phones are switched off. Something's wrong. Stay with the tanker. And follow plan C. Copy, sir. - Follow the tanker... -Yes sir. You've parked the Scorpio in front of the wrong car, Sarfaraz. Yes Sir. The ACP looks confused. That's the way he looks... confused. l'm not confused at all. l know you people well. This is Sonu Dilli right? No, this is Shah Rukh Khan. And that one is Salman Khan. And l am Amitabh Bachchan. Now what? Then we'll have to make a blockbuster. Such a movie that'll never go out of theatres. People will garland your photos. Okay, do call us for the inaugural ceremony. We'll bring the garlands ourselves. Do you understand? Here's the first scene of the movie. Let's go then, bye. Let's go. l need revenge. Just shut your phone. l need revenge. Revenge? That scoundrel policeman. We should've killed him right there... that would be perfect! You just said 'bye' and left. We would've killed him, and then? What then? The deal would have been saved, what else! lf we've lost millions today, that isn't because of the policeman... it's because of that informer! He works for us and for the police. What do we do now? Now we need to find that traitor... and exact our revenge! First of all, l'll gather everyone's mobile phones. That's it... finally you've spoken something intelligent. Surrenderyour phones, everyone. Come on, give me your phone. You too, Sonu Dilli. Get your phone here. lf l'm among everyone, then why aren't you? You keep your phone first, then l will. You're ordering me? Let me tell you this... He might be the boss, but l run the business! And l expand it. What? Are you comparing yourself to me? Sarfaraz, he makes sense. Come on... Boss... You keep your phone there, so will he. Okay. l want to talk to you in private. Come on! You should've been called 'madman'. - Go! -Why're you still here? He may be your son-in-law, but l suspect him. Don't call on my phone under any circumstances, it's with them. l've saved your number as 'wife', but they'll figure out if they hearyour voice... that you're not my wife, but her brother. Understood? Now l'm hanging up. Who are you off to marry now? You. Me? So what happened in court that day then? We got married, as far as l remember. But you don't remember. Because for you, signing a document does not mean getting married. That's why you don't take my calls, don't give me time. You've forgotten that we're husband and wife. So this is my way of reminding you. Maybe if we do the rituals. Now that l have you in my arms ...there is stability. Thank you Lord. My breath is intoxicated ...leaving me with its effects. Thank you Lord. You are my day ...my religion. Thank you Lord. You are my chant ...my call for prayer. Thank you Lord. l got you and gained everything How can l complain? Let us fuse together, let me decimate, let me get destroyed in your arms. lt is a speech of emotions Thank you Lord. lt is my recent speech ...my new pride. Thank you Lord. Now we deserve the honeymoon. Let's go some place far away. l feel like l'm starting all over. l'm getting closer to heaven. Let's settle down in Digha,forever. Let's find our spot in some corner of the world. No horns, no sirens, no shouts, just love. Okay? You'll like Digha. The place is perfect. You know, there are no mobile towers in Digha. Mobile phones can't work there. Your phone won't ring at all. Yours is ringing. Hello? l need to speak with Sonu. Just a minute. lt's for you. On your phone? Hello. lsn't Metro a convenient way to travel. Hello? Meet me at gate no 8. Hello? Wrong number. Do the check-in. l'll just go to the washroom. Shoot me! l had come to shoot you, really. But l saw you with the doctor, and l calmed down. l got reminded of the time l was off for my honeymoon, like you. You make a nice couple. That's why you want to break us up? No... l'm not so stonehearted. ljust want Mangal Singh in my grasp! Then l'll see you two off myself. So should l put him on a platter and bring him to you? l'd set everything up properly, but one of your policemen works for him. First find out who's the traitor then we'll talk. l will, but you hang around. l can't. Sarfaraz suspects me... he's taken my phone away. l told you already. He'll even figure out that l'm your informer. What if he knows already? He may have started hunting me already. l can't live on the edge anymore. Calm down, catch your breath. You don't stop talking. They can't find out. l've destroyed all the phone records. l blew up their tanker so that they... would be forced to do the deal again. And l won't go wrong this time, just come back. This time l'm not blackmailing you, l'm requesting you. And what do l tell Jaanvi? Who can beat you at making excuses? Say anything! Hardeep, we need to track a phone. l think this is what l'll do all day. There are 14 phones to track. See... Who gave you this phone? l think Rajender gave it. Where is he? He went towards your table. Who gave you this phone? Who has asked for this phone to be tracked urgently? Sir it's the most expensive in the lot. Rathore sir of Pahandganj sent this over. His people confiscated this from somewhere. Why is your hand in a cast? My wrist has broken. What's broken? My wrist. Sir! Sir, what are you doing? Have you gone mad? Sir, just leave him. Who are you working for? You traitor! Have you gone mad? Sir, someone amongst us works for Mangal Singh. Who keeps him informed of all our activities. l will find him! And is this your method of finding him? To treat your colleagues like criminals? l'm just doing my duty, sir. Duty? You aren't doing your duty, Pratap. You're just trying to get revenge. You can't sleep right? Not because you're doing your duty. But because you're still carrying your wife's corpse around. You're such a selfish man. You are not an angel in any sense. Just another ACP. Who was only determined and staunch so far... and who is now going mad. Crazy. Enough is enough, Pratap... l can't protect you anymore. lf you do something like this again... You'll fire me right? l have run out of coins again! l have run out of coins again! - ldiot! - Don't be offended, sir. But think about the living today. Think about Sonu. What happened to Sonu Dilli? Sarfaraz has his men following him... keeping an eye on his every move. at any moment now they may... l am telling you Sir. No... Sonu Dilli must not be harmed. l've promised him that nothing will hurt him. What's the matter, sir? l've worked with you for several years. You haven't ever felt this way for an informer... No... that no-good rogue Sonu Dilli. Him and his wife, l feel like they're my own. lf either of them are hurt... there will be trouble. Nothing will happen. Do you understand? l understand, sir. There will be trouble. What's the matter? You look like you've seen a ghost! Balli, l feel like... someone's following me. ls it? You feel like that? Are you the informer that everyone's looking for? l'm joking. But can l say something? You aren't the same Sonu Dilli KKC. You seem different since the last few weeks. That drive is missing. You would say that in our business... the one who gets scared dies quickly. Stop lecturing! l'm worried forJaanvi. Have you seen me behind those four walls of the house? When l'm there, l'm like ordinary people. Not like this. l even pick up the towel after a bath otherwise she gets angry. l haven't felt like this before. l'm scared l might end up losing her. Brother, we're street hustlers. We aren't meant to get married... but l don't understand how you became the Romeo suddenly. Another thing... that girl... l won't call her sister-in-law... that girl who you've gotten married to... the day she finds out the whole truth... she'll dump you and walk away... remember this. You? You're queuing up with a token? l wanted to meet you like a patient... Really? What have you cut today? Are you all right? l don't know why l feel like there's something you... are trying to say, but can't. ljust want to hold you close once... l think of you night and day how more can l love you? l am drowned in your thoughts how more can l love you? l am with you, in all your sorrows l am with you, in all seasons Don't test me so Now l'm sure that Jaanvi is my life. My universe, my bliss. Raghuvanshi and Mangal Singh, you can go to hell. Once l get out of this mess, l'll go away with Jaanvi. There is no further movement... There is no deal planned after that fiasco. You aren't planning something, are you? You aren't fooling me right? What are you saying, sir? Call me if there's any update, all right. Yes, l will. l'm hanging up. l am fooling you, you idiot. l'm not called a cheeky rogue for nothing. You are where l reside, your home Every dusk, l come to you. l come to you. don't go anywhere. You are safe there, the world is a cruel place. l am with you, in all your sorrows l am with you, in all seasons Don't test me so Perfect. Take it. Your life is set now. Because where you are going is heaven. Don't jinx it... nobody else knows about this plan, apart from you. l'm planning to surprise Jaanvi today. And by tomorrow we'll both have gotten out of here. lt seems his phone book has only my contact number. Yes sir? l've not seen your pretty face for quite some time. Meet me tonight. Sir not tonight... Come to the mosque at 8 pm, we'll pray for you. Okay l'll be there. After tonight l'll be rid of him and Delhi once and for all. Thank you. Listen, you wait here. l'll be back. What's going on? Tell me...? Greetings sir. Pratap is meeting his informer at the mosque right now. - Give me a shawl. -Yes sir. You don't meet me nowadays. So tell me where and when this deal is happening? Sarfaraz has the details, he has kept me out of it. He is suspicious of me. Only he can help you. Follow him. - Please excuse me. - Give me change sir. Come on. Balli, where are you and Sonu? His phone is switched off. We're at the mosque. Get here quick! The informer is here. We're at Vasant Vihar. We're on our way. You rascal! Traitor! Let's go. You're losing a lot of blood. go see a doctor. You saved me from that bullet. But if Mangal's men see us together... there will be more bullets... how will you save me from that? No one has seen us together, and Sarfaraz is with us now. Now you're Mangal Singh's only close aide. He'll definitely trust you now. Now listen... l saved your life for my sake... for the deal. Go now, finish the deal. ''The numberyou have called is switched off. Please try again later.'' ''The numberyou have called is switched off. Please try again later.'' So will you tell us about this deal on your own... or should l twist it out of you? l have policemen like you eating out of my hand. You're lucky that the bullet only hit your hand... go bandage it well. Oryou'll lose the whole arm. Disabled. Then this will be the hand to talk to you. Why're you questioning me about the deal? You have an informer. He is Tomar's son-in-law. He's been planning it right from the start. He's going to do the deal. Why? What did he tell you? He's made a fool out of you! And what are you going to do about it. You're more innocent than we all thought. Where have you been? Yes, sir. l was... So it turned out to be one of us after all. This is like looking all over for the spectacles atop your head. l didn't get you. We found the one we were looking for, the police informer... your close friend... No, sir. There's been a misunderstanding. He's my childhood friend. He's a total coward. He can never be an informer. Release him! So why was he at the mosque then? - He lied to us. - Let me explain. No. Let him explain. Open his gag. Yes, l went to the mosque. With Sarfaraz. l was working for him... and he was working for the police. What rubbish! You were with me... l've made a mistake, please forgive me. He's lying! He was your friend. Now he's a traitor. Sarfaraz had spoken of parting ways. l know the police have arrested Sarfaraz... they cannot protect him. but before that... we have to get Balli out of the way. Sir, listen to me. Get on with it! Wait! Let me do it. ls this your solution to settle all dues?! Have you become so brave? We're partners in business, not in death. You know how scared l am of dying. Wait a while. l'll return every penny. l can explain. l'm listening. l'm a police informer. And l'm working for them because... l wanted to live an honest life with you. ACP Pratap Raghuvanshi promised me that he'll give me a chance to lead a decent life. Jaanvi... Jaanvi, l wanted to take you away from here, long ago. But now l'm stuck in a huge mess. lf you'd prefer... l'll request Pratap to speak to you. He'll explain everything to you. Will you believe me then? Lies. Every word is a lie. l don't believe you. Jaanvi l'm not lying. Trust me. l always wanted to keep you happy. Fine. Get him. But l give you only one day to do it. That's enough. l'll get Pratap... he'll make you understand. Then we'll leave this city and go somewhere far away. Wait for me... Don't give up on us. Come with me, now. Come and tell Jaanvi that l work for you. Not for Mangal Singh. Don't you? You lied to me. l kept asking you about the deal and... To hell with the deal! Deal, deal...all the time! Here my entire life could be ruined... my marriage is breaking down. Yes, l kept things from you. Because l wanted to run away from here... from all of you. l'm sick of living like a dog... being kicked between Mangal Singh and you! l don't want anything to do with either of you... l've already lost my Balli. Now l don't want to lose Jaanvi overyour callousness. Do you understand? Today your friend was killed and you're a mess. Your wife's about to leave you, so you're crying... So you now want to be honourable, Sonu Dilli? Have you forgotten who you are? Do you know, my wife was killed by a similar weapon that killed Balli. Whether Balli dies or other innocent people die, what do you care? you only want your own happiness. So go on... Find your bliss hiding in Jaanvi's skirt. You wanted to make her happy right? But you won't be able to. Just like the bullet in my head doesn't let me sleep. Balli's death won't let you live. And l'll see... how a man with a dead soul can keep someone else happy. Go on. Send your wife to me. l will tell heryou work for us, you coward! The deal will take place in the abandoned ruin. Guns are being loaded there. Only Sarfaraz knows where the guns are going. This is the last time l'm helping you. l'm going there now. Are you telling me this after hearing my words, or is this your conscience speaking? Both. One thing l know for sure... Sonu Dilli may be a cheeky rogue... but never a coward. l hope that rascal Sarfaraz didn't let out too much. l haven't heard dead men speak yet. Have you explained everything to Jaanvi? Very well. This gun's rusted... Are all of them like this? Check all of them. Are you going to check every single gun? The ceremony is at 4 PM, the inauspicious time starts after that. You'll risk losing face over superstition? We're the largest dealers in guns. There's some responsibility to it. See, see for yourself. Check them all. Get rid of this. Oh no! What's this? He's dead. Who else knew that he was here? No one. Whoever killed him... would now know that Sonu works for us. No no no! lsn't this the type of cigarette Rajender smokes? Where is he? He is out with Unit No 3. Sonu's life is in danger! Greetings sir. Catch hold of him. The police is here. Just leave them, Sonu is more important. Check there. Go there. Get me out of here quickly! Come at the backroads of the ruins. l'm coming, just get here! You filthy police... Hey, don't move. Stop! - Call Pratap. - Leave him. Hey you... move aside. Don't move! Constable, handcuff him! Quickly! Pratap was right. One of us was a traitor. l should've trusted him. You've done good work for us today. You'll be rewarded well. Sir, if my name is cleared, that's enough reward for me. Okay, l'll take your leave. Go call everyone else. Greetings... Sir, perfect timing! Now please speak with my Jaanvi quickly. Now l'll finally go home to her. Pratap...! Sonu! Sonu! lt's an emergency! lt's an emergency! Call his family. His condition is critical. Thank you... Today, l finally did a good deed thanks to you. But l don't have much time left... My life wasn't a complete waste, was it? No... No... l will tell Jaanvi the truth. No, please don't tell her the truth. That will be too heavy a burden. She will not be able to live freely... Just like you are not able to. Understand? Understand?! Thank you. Search the place! Who are you? - Search everywhere thoroughly. -What's the matter? You sit down. Sit! Where is he? Who? Sonu Dilli, who else? Who are you? ACP Pratap Raghuvanshi. Pratap Raghuvanshi? This is the name he had mentioned. He told me, he works for you. He's your informer. So why are you looking for him? He's not my informer. He gave you this tall story? He doesn't have enough honor to work for me. He's a third class criminal... Check the police records. Sonu Dilli, the cheeky rogue. That's what he's known as. He's the biggest supplier of illegal guns. What? See this? He didn't even spare his own home. What did he tell you? That he had a clothes business? He's traded in death... with your father, Mangal Singh, for the past five years. And now he's absconding. He has fled the country now. So he lied to me? Of course he lied. Be grateful that you found out sooner than later! Forget him. Move on. Let's go. You really did turn out to be a cheeky rogue, Sonu Dilli! Let's go. Bit by bit... You seem a little upset Bit by bit... Drop the reason l am separated only for you Have the heavens ever been destroyed? Bit by bit... Like a thick fog on the road l am separated only for you Have the heavens ever been destroyed?
