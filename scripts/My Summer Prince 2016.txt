last three days features the author their rating her staff starting again people we are starting to get right now and will have me legendary author Barbara kirkland live it's ok that is a perfect example of what you absolutely cannot say in the interview I'm aware of that Deidre you need to be gracious you need to be apologetic you had a bad day everyone has a bad day isn't that right Mandy absolutely human say this has been a humbling experience and you're grateful for it yes people can relate to that honestly this is just one little video on the internet this is a bit of an overreaction that's what people do on the internet they overreact Barbara I want you to think about your readers I want you to think about that multimillion-dollar industry that surrounds that singing salamander I'll be fine I know how to handle the press with all due respect if you knew how to handle the press I wouldn't be here so you'll do exactly as I say so any regrets make no mistake this has been quite horrifying but see yourself at your worst through someone else's eyes it's instructive this has been a humbling experience and for that I am truly grateful we'll be back after the break my friends we have slayed the dragon lady wanted great work on the thanks just ok so what was Barbara kirkland like in person she terribly not when you work for Deidre good job making her look so I just

Cooper you stop right there what's wrong are those the Ferragamo comes from your Pinterest for you gotta dress for the job you want not the job you have I promised myself today went well I asked Deidre for a little more responsibility and if you don't ask you don't get exactly detra a moment I'm listening I am I thought today went really well thank you and I worked very hard to contribute to the work we do and you feel like that's not being acknowledged know if absolutely is the thing is I'm going to do more for our clients for the firm for you meaning want well I i have a ba in marketing and public relations and as gratifying as it is being your assistant you feel ready for a new challenge yes yes that's that's it exactly anybody to keep your ketchup beg your pardon the condiment catch up are you familiar yes yeah yeah I know I'm I know what catches is good where do you keep it in the fridge and why is that I think it sets you on the bottom are you sure about that suddenly I'm not if you go into a diner the cattle business sitting there on the table they don't serve it chilled well and never thought that no you wouldn't Mandy you are very good at doing what you're told that a good PR person takes deeper than that they want to know why things are done in a certain way my junior executives excel in formulating and executing plans of action but that's not you mandy is it to my because i keep my ketchup in the refrigerator no that's where I keep mine but i wanted there because I preferred you put it there because somebody told you yeah so apparently that's it mom I'm going to be an assistant for the rest of my life because I don't properly question the storage of my hamburger toppings that's the silliest thing I've ever heard i'm looking at the back of the bottle right now and it says for best results refrigerate after opening not really the point of my story I know the point is I work harder than anyone else that firm hoping they'll get a chance to move up but Diedre thinks all I can do is fetch coffee and that is exactly why you need this vacation tomorrow this time we're going to be sipping frozen fruity drinks on the beach it has been ages since I've had both my girls in the same place you have got to see your sister you got the baby shower invitation i did and i want to be there but it was hard enough getting time off for a beach trip Mandy we just miss you I miss you too i'll see you tomorrow for sunshine and fruity drinks love you love you rowdy night out in your town of Brian idaho for Prince Khalid of engineer who took up rain for this official visit to the u.s. to live up to his bad-boy reputation Prince colin has been charged with the facing public land is currently in the custody of the greenbrier sheriff's it is the latest scandal involving his royal highness adding fuel to growing concerned as to whether print colin is fit to be king is Her Majesty know what may I be of service man please alert the kitchen instead of teen cake this afternoon will be having one of those blended concoctions with wheatgrass and was it called kale I believe your majesty is requesting a smoothie and must consider my health finality because clearly i can never die Your Majesty I send my son to America to dedicate a university library in memory of his late father shockingly simple task all you had to do was wave and cut a ribbon somehow this leads to the crown prince of Edgemere being arrested for taking a bar in a public fountain I can assure you ma'am he remained closed the whole time Oh marvelous so he doesn't understand her bathing works what was going through his mind is gone mad taken up drinking oh no nothing of the sort he was just overly rambunctious and water lady Isabella does she know about this I'm certain she does begging your pardon ma'am I doubt she's any more surprised than we are such an embarrassment colin is not demonstrating the behavior of a man really for marriage would you believe in 10 days Penelope celebrating 25 years of my reign a quarter-century of leadership sacrifice that the eyes of the world will be upon us I will not have this distraction what is your Majesty's will i'm afraid we require outside assistance Prince Colin of Edgemere heir to the throne darling of the tabloids to face her of fountains and our new client the princes in greenbrier Idaho one of those charming little towns that looks like something in the Thomas Kincaid painting the director of royal communications is on her way to idaho and the prince will be released into her custody but we still have a court date to deal with so our strategy get the sheriff to drop all the charges issue an apology and a few good photo ops Robert I'd like you to prepare a list of local charities that would love a generous donation from the royal family you got it Jamal I need Intel on that chair if I want to know who I'm up against Mandy I want flights to idaho tonight and rooms at the little in and greenbriar for both of us us I actually i am i'm playing out tonight to be my mother and sister at the beach you know fourth of july weekend vacation this is the first I'm hearing of this oh actually i think i mentioned it when you are approved it my sister and her husband are expecting so we thought a girls trip with peaches I'm sorry did I say something that would lead you to believe that I was interested in those details and I apologize oh no I apologize I thought working directly with one of our most high-profile clients for someone seeking greater responsibility would be interesting button I understand you want to go to the beach how fun that child cried right next to me the entire left tens dear I don't even know why they allowed children first class in the future you have to find out who's sitting next to me i'm not sure how do that oh you'll find a way I couldn't relax that incessant wailing in my ear and now we have more than an hour drive to greenbrier oh when I don't get rest i get dark circles under my eyes going to meet the prince looking like Uncle Fester yeah this is the little hotel yeah thank you my pleasure teacher are you feeling alright just a little jet liked your keys and my overnight bag ok you take the suitcases I need everything press make sure they know not too much starch do you want to go over your notes for me yeah just come to the room the morning

morning yes Your Majesty I won't let him out of my sight for a second yeah yeah this is what is happening to me it could be some sort of allergy not an allergy allergies are for weak people and I can adapt to any environment that's not really how allergies were I'm not in the mood for semantics Mandy what does the internet have well it says it could just be acne it most certainly could not okay bedbugs the bedbugs only live in New York or it might well you know you had chicken pox when you're kidding you of course not i mean you know how some point it spread through your kindergarten class like wildfire exactly what sort of school did your parents send you to be around a bunch of kids and happen which is exactly why i have avoided children my entire life especially when I was a child boom it was that wailing toddler on the clean oh he did this to me on that poor kid no wonder you said about it right now buddy oh it's like an opening scene one of those outbreak movies let's just get you to adapter okay get me my makeup bag oh no you cannot put makeup on chicken pox it can lead to scarring well I can't go out looking like this my face looks like strawberry parfait well I'll have a doctor come to you and I'll get calamine lotion and something for the fever really the best thing you can do is get back in bed if it is chicken pox it is highly contagious ok this is a crisis I can handle it all from here you will just have to go to the meeting in my place oh ok well you were looking for greater responsibility Mandy here's your chance miss Kelly good morning glad I call you i have your suits oh the freshly pressed just as you requested hey but you have a great day up and adjust the job you want what the devil good morning that the brand new day weekend woman I need sleep I've been through an ordeal don't you think we're getting a little old for these shenanigans coming up and happy shenanigans make life with many don't be clever I'm immune to your charms now get up someone's in a mood this morning if I appear to be in the mood it's because i have neither the time nor the inclination to scurry about cleaning up after another one of your messes and yet here we are the situation is so dire we have actually had to enlist the aid of an American i must be very difficult for you i will suffer the indignity you have laid at my feet and we will repair the damage you're the best i just got a bit more shy that you take care of things your Royal Highness kindly dress yourself and join me in the drawing room otherwise i will return with a bucket of ice water good morning i'm penelope shows and you must be miss Kelly you always carry audio mi yes yes here Superman miss Kelly may I offer you a cup of tea yes please thank you i'm sure you keep quite an active calendar the Queen would like me to convey her appreciation for making yourself available this is precisely what I make myself available for please do sit so you met with the sheriff last night when I retrieved his Highness yes I must warn you he seems disinclined to drop the charges you let me worry about that where's the prince now prince so I hear your Royal Highness may I present miss Deirdre Kelly this Kelly pleasure meeting you I'm very sorry for me to travel all this way for nothing but we do not require your services sir as we discussed my mother seems to think I need to be bundled and sold to the public like a pack of sausages not really interested in that sort of thing that we can sort everything out she always does so this time I cannot splashed around and Affeldt and ran afoul of the sheriff with that too much time on his hands you're behaving as I'd burn down a building you were arrested there are actual consequences think of the press I've dealt with the press my entire life this will blow over your majesty my mother is imagine see my proper addresses your highness followed thereafter sorry you're quite young for public relations executive I moisturize your royal highness Sir with all due respect if you know how to handle the press I wouldn't be here so from now on you're going to do exactly what I tell you to do oh my you certainly have put me in my place now i can't help but comply can I really no have you gone quite mad i'm going back to bed normally that's much more effective actually that would much better than I anticipated help me i'm sorry but I can't let that boy off with just a slap on the wrist share frankly we're talking about the Clown Prince of Edgemere you see I don't even know where that is what i do know about is that found it was built in nineteen thirteen by the town's founder to honor his life and the founders found was listed on the National Historic Registry of Family and there's not a man woman or child greenbrier west made a wish in that balance so you see that fellow was literally stomping on people's wishes and we want to make that right dropping the charges and set a dangerous precedent I mean I'd be haulin tourists and vigorous out of that water every night it's a slippery slope the next thing you know hooligan to be taking over the town not on my watch it sounds likely wears a very special place it is sure frankly consider just for a moment if Prince Collin pay the fine maybe spend a few nights in jail does that really help your wonderful town wanna make sure i'm not so sure that if you did some sort of community service think of the press coverage people would have the chance to get to know greenbrier as the unique Jim it so clearly is now when yes I can't believe it's working but it is i've got the sheriff to compromise without resorting to details usual techniques of intimidation and humiliation I'm proving I can execute a plan but why did you say you were her i don't know she asking i just check yes I couldn't stop myself Mandy you've got to fix this before it goes any further if you make a choice you can take back your gonna be forced to live with the consequences look I'm not proud of it but there's no going back like what am I supposed to do tell them that i forgot my own name if I can't get prints Colin to go along with the Sheriff's offer a hero true you really think you can print your plan absolutely not this is what with being digitally to do make arrangements me to click rubbish at the roadside the public it screaming an act of contrition from you about my dignity your dignity is that an attempt at humor Your Highness may I remind you we are in this predicament because you decided to take a romp in a decorative fountains I was celebrating celebrating what exactly a moment's freedom not having every second of my life dictated by Her Majesty can you imagine lady Isabella ceilings in all this all I can do is imagine lady Isabel others feelings she certainly isn't gonna show them lady isabella is a dignified young lady who understands protocol you could learn a great deal from her it's the Royal Jubilee in eight days you have become a liability your image has to be rehabilitated before we announce your engagement to lady Isabella at the ball of course we must make me fit for life no your highness we must make you fit from Queen they're not every spot i look horrible don't know you look like you need some rest and get better the doctor says I'm going to be contagious for up to five days this is a nightmare I feel like Typhoid Mary and the bitch is driving me insane did you pick up that oatmeal bad on it these things with Prince Colin are looking up the community service angle is a stroke of genius yeah i'm just glad the sheriff it will showcase the community humanize the prince and the optics will be fabulous that's why it was my only prudent option you followed my plans very well Mandy thanks i'll run your bath oh we should review this statement for tomorrow's press conference can you get that Penelope woman on the phone well what now the Royal communications director I haven't spoken to her yet can you get her on the phone oh yeah of course I am so sorry so understand how this happened I slipped it was an accident it really was course it was an accident why would you do it on purpose right why would I do that just

trying to help you you don't have to pretend you actually care what happens to I'm not pretending think of me as a friend people in my position did have the luxury of friends you have been assigned to me like everyone else in my life I'm trying to understand your resistance it's a simple apology no miss Kelly it is not it is yet another reminder that I'm a bottomless pit of disappointment both my family and my country meant honestly it is exhausting scoot over he played very well thank you and you didn't learn to play when I did you know they require discipline and practice little by little better that's all we're asking small steps but you see examples folder because i hated running piano lessons for 11 years mother father insisted that I learn Tchaikovsky shop and if i was told me that's like really find it difficult to imagine and I'm giving you orders may be surprised well I started finding ways to subvert expectations whenever my parents were out of earshot at play songs from the radio yes I know that song don't and keep on looking because it is wow your act of musical rebellion was an eighties power behind already Speedwagon has a very impressive capital and now yes of course they did my parents love them I just didn't expect no walking no I'm not it's a great song your highness it's called it if you insist on making my musical taste at least do so using my Christian name there was only knows if they're tabloid stories and official appearances yes I'm I'm not asking to be anyone other than yourself but see this who you are right now relax human funny you think I'm funny moments Colin you can control the fact that people are watching on the time but you can influence with this yeah dear Joe Kelly yes Danny Pendergrass greenbrier chamber of commerce I have a gift basket here for the prince it's a selection of locally made goods and produce oh wow that is significantly heavier than I expected yeah there's a lot of potatoes in there if I can give any assistance at all please don't stay to ask oh great haha keep in mind thanks yeah good afternoon first I'd like to thank the good people of green rider of the gracious hospitality unfortunately I challenge that hospitality two nights ago by being very bad guest I wish to be very clear my lack of regard for the founders fountain and what it represents this community was uncalled for now my countrymen of question that this is the behavior of the future King I can say unequivocally that it is not now I must take responsibility that result to do better i humbly offer my apologies both to the citizens of Greenbriar and the people of every I'm grateful to the sheriff's department to give me the opportunity to repay my debts greenbrier through community service I look forward to making a positive contribution in the coming days you wrote that realm and then ragat even so you approve was going you did very well sir I told you it's calling still getting comfortable Mike we didn't oh yes

what I live with every day my total dictates everything where I go what I do friendships relationships but nobody ever bothered to ask me what I want to do my life well Colin what do you want to do with your idol I don't know what I'd like the option of finding out i must say i was pleasantly surprised yes he presented himself quite well didn't he the true challenge of course will be tomorrow's agenda kiss miss Kelly is quite deserving of her reputation indeed I never asked Your Majesty what made you contact her firm highly recommended through the former prime minister sri lanka miss Kelly assisted with the crisis perhaps 15 years ago 15 years really so that would make her 40 or 45 years old not in the habit of speculating on a person's age are we gonna be of course not my apologies send my best wishes to his royal highness until tomorrow then Your Majesty lady Isabel please sit toward away all the pleasure I came for the fitting of my ball gown i wanted to share my delight

dungeon Williams i have no idea what those are but i'll trust formalities I should take this work of course the rest for the weary it's more than that yeah what's wrong aah now you're gonna have been woven into your tapestry of lies and deception and when it inevitably unravels I'm going on with you what are you talking about Deirdre called the office she wanted probably still number i don't know what you say I told her those European cell phones are notoriously unreliable in the US but that's good you did kinda did i yes I'm not an experienced guy like you I'm not an experienced liar well he will be soon because you're gonna be plenty of practice we only have to keep this up for a few more days after Prince calling completes this community service i'll confess everything to detra she'll be so happy with how everything turned out it'll be like no big deal at all you really believe that I have to come in too deep to turn back now yeah what I took my eyes off him for a second to last

you may I come in of course please oh I'm sorry if i seemed surprised they just don't remember telling you about rumors in you didn't I can uncover any information I need that's my job and what about you what's your job because it appears you're currently doing someone else's i have served the royal family in varying capacities my entire life there is no scheme trickery or intrigue that I have not previously encountered however if it gets the desired effect you'll get no argument from me if I'm not informed i cannot be of assistance so dear who the devil are you what has happened to the real dearie Kelly I don't know how to explain this try to keep your catch up your impersonation of me is aggressively bad not go with accents that much is obvious well miss Cooper there are so many flaws in your little scheme that I truly don't know where to begin I kept thinking it would be so much easier for Deidre and everyone listens to her and trust your ideas so when you asked if I was her I just I said yes I know I shouldn't have said it but i did and now i'm dealing with that i can say with absolute certainty that you will get caught and the fallout will be horrendous it's just for a few more days and then I promise I will confess everything Penelope please will you help me we've done such good work that is true and the prince is clearly fond of you you think so it's not my intention to flatter you I'm merely pointing out a further complication of course you could mean much to consider you may be assured of my participation for now but not my approval I'm getting out absolutely not so I wanted to serve in the military but I'm an only child there is no spare yeah that's why my mother was always so you know protected I was going to smothering intrusive but it's not so much nicer I'm sure she just wants what's best in her own way that's like the true some things are worth the conversation oh yeah no I've been helpful thank you we should go why thank you getting back in if the sheriff see we will go after collecting are we picking up rubbish at the roads life for a month you know the story behind this man the town founder built in tribute to his right and that's where everyone goes to make a wish well you know what they say when you're not have no one says that you should be looking my grandfather's face the McCune he was a lucky man anything but go ahead yeah much more composed behind on some secret yeah where were you and who saw you nothing to fear miss Kelly was with me the entire time about miscarriage is quite extraordinary isn't she she's not what I expected you know some empathy all this time my title has been a burden to me this yoke around my neck requiring me to be something I'm not and I admit I have room for improvement who doesn't undoubtedly but dealers got me wondering what if I could do this just as I am when I might be the exact change the one continues what if my instincts are in fact correct indeed sir sorry to

time in greenbrier as a monarch and as a mother I have been curious to see what it is about this community that could awaken a spirit of service leadership in my son and judging by this lovely work

introductions to be made your royal highness at last we meet my name is Deirdre Kelly I'm sorry this is digitally no darling this seems to be a bit of confusion there is a woman here in the hideous dress to whom we have entrusted the reputation and future of the monarchy is due to Kelly's assistant Mandy Cooper isn't that right dear I don't understand I just I wanted to prove it to the job that I could execute a plan and the ketchup and well I didn't see the harm Prince Colin was just another client and didn't expect seitan I didn't meet I just got so caught up now I could find my way back of it and I felt awful the whole time but I did do the job in your reputation is restored in of co con youth at my trial that's true you've done your job very well it's quite impressive you're capable of tactics i would have never expected to me I have my friend I don't even know you is about that alert now return to edge me tonight yeah well that's unexpected you have lied to me with every breath this entire week received royalty to mention entire town i strongly suspect you any money for a cell phone and I wouldn't be surprised if you arrange for that toddler to give me chicken pox and they have ever seen deception such a level i'm gonna fly back to New York tomorrow you will pack up your desk and we are done nod if you understand well I'm going to go and salvage the banquet forward of this disaster reaches the Queen yeah Colin you know the worst of it I was foolish enough to be comfortable I should have known that any happy outcome must be based on a lie I lied about my name in my job everything else that happened was to swim how can I trust that how can I believe anything you say Daedra see I don't even know your name it's Mandy Cooper when I care about you very much if you had about me you to trust me with the truth I'm sorry why did you never mention Isabella mean not even once you know what and now i feel very food is Cooper yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah you wanted to see me yes i just read your report is it the truth it's everything I did yes well there are some masterful maneuvers here Mandy you have a real talent I can't afford to have that brain working for someone else so I've decided not to terminate your employment really well I were being honest i'd say this don't reminded me of something i would do at your age yes I haven't met anyone with that amount of hutzpah and a long time you're quite an asset however if you decide to execute some devious master plan in the future I expect to be included I don't know what to say say thank you Deirdre thank you your track there's just one thing I can't figure out what's that why didn't you fight for him I'm sorry look at this picture man that is the face of someone smooth i didn't fight for him because he discovered my rich tapestry of lies and deception is getting married lady Isabella and he basically said it can ever trust me so I think it's probably best we just did she say so i have an invitation to the Queen's Jubilee tomorrow night a generic as a thank-you for our efforts but I'm not the person deserving of that gratitude in life but the invitations for you not me all so now you have a problem using my name but I have nothing to wear and i would have to fly out tonight speaking in time Cinderella meet your very own your highness I have the official statement about your engagement all i need is your approval sure if it means his mother's approval I have nothing two and oh dear we're regressing after we make some progress for heaven's sake what more do you people want I'm fulfilling every single duty to the crown I understand my responsibility and I've made my peace with it Preston may we have the room please map calling do you know what made your time at Greenbriar so extraordinary it wasn't that you behaved yourself although admittedly that was refreshing it was the two followed your heart you allowed yourself to be true to your instincts showing kindness and concern for others it was my first glimpse of the kind of Monarch that you will one day become and it filled me with such pride and that's why I allowed to miss Cooper's little deception to continue you knew of course I knew I have told you repeatedly I know everything that's happening at all times miss Cooper brought out the best in you that doesn't go away just because she has it was almost on the y OS silly voice here in a false name there in all fairness you weren't entirely forthcoming with her either I know that there's not much I can do about that now one day you will rule our country and your decisions will not buckle under the weight of your title they will be fortified by act just consider all the consequences and then do what you genuinely feel is best it's likely you'll move in the right direction yeah so sorry for delay darling around to the Spanish ambassador's wife she was a delightful story to share where I belong now yes after the announcement is made shall we say a few words or go directly to the dance tuition and I want to tell me you want do you wear that just what you've been told what meet you don't love me as a brother and I don't love you we get all right but we've never for a moment been in love there's not a marriage is not what we never actually want real marriage to spend far more than laughs it's about duty and responsibility to the monarchy maintaining and preserving over a hundred years of tradition these things matter Colin yes they do matter but I will not marry woman I do not love I thought you had changed but you're just as childish as spoiled as you ever heard of selfish back you're wrong i have changed and I want that same change for you i want you to explore possibilities to indulge her passion he didn't think I had other interests other hopes for the future but we could accomplish together exceeds that I was willing to set everything aside for you i'm quite sure i never asked you to do that you deserve a life better than that which duty dictates I want you to want you to fall in love will have lovely Colin how gracious inclined isabella is that what this is about you think you love her the American liar i'm honestly not quite true but my feelings often miss Cooper but she made me realize I deserve the chance to live a life on my own terms and there's something no going back to the way things were excuse me yeah yeah yeah what you believe thank you yeah now you are wise lady Isabella it's nearly time for the announcement ladies about his returns to her estate values there will be an announcement Oh calling know what did you do mother I will marry for love or not at all if you expect me to understand the criminal you have to learn to occasionally trust my judgment there will be a

put shoes but it's even more common i owe you an apology needed for halfway around the world for that just a nice mood i wanted to see if I know you're getting married and I have no intention of getting in the way that but i wanted to earn your trust you with me I want to be friends well that's very kind of you thank you i appreciate the apology but I wasn't entirely honest with you either
