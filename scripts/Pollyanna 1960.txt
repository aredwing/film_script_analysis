Get away. - Looks like she's on time. - That she is. Harrington! Oh, let me help you with that, little girl. Thank you. Watch your step. There you are, little girl. Now, I have to go to the store. You go get the luggage. Be careful of the fresh eggs. They're wrapped in paper. - Yes, dear. - Oh, Ben? Yes, dear? Write a letter to the president of this railroad. There were men smocking in the parlor car. Disgraceful! - I've taken his number. - Yes, dear. - Miss Pollyanna? - Yes. Aunt Polly? No, I'm Nancy. I work for your aunt, and I came here to fetch you. Oh. How dc you dc? This is Mr. Thomas, the gardener. - How dc you dc? - Hello, young lady. Oh, no, no, no! Thomas will take that for you. Put it in the back seat. Good afternoon, Mrs. Tarbell. Is that Jenny Harringtons child? Yes, it is. Doesnt look a thing like any of the Harringtons. - What's your name, girl? - Speak up. Pollyanna Whittier, ma'am. Well, youre a very fortunate little girl. Most children who have lost their parents would end up in an orphanage. You know that, don't you? Yes, ma'am. Well, thank your lucky stars for such a good woman as your aunt taking you in. Yes, ma'am. Yes, well, see that you're properly appreciative, and don't cause any trouble. Children really never realize- - Ed? - Uncle Karl! - Much too long. - It's good to see you. Oh, here. How's everything at the house? Just fine. He's come back. Wait 'til Polly Harrington hears about this. Right up here in the back seat, honey. There you are. Nancy, what are you staring at? Oh, nothing. Nothing at all, sir. Think she'll want the car? I dont know if she wants the car or not. Youll have to ask her yourself. Your aunt's waiting for you, miss. Hurry up. I haven't got all day! Oh, Mr. Thomas, please put that here. All right, Nancy. All right. You wait here, miss, and dont touch anything. - Do you understand? - Yes, ma'am. Well, we had, uh, Matthew. Mark last week. But Isaiah has some very good passages. - Isaiah? - Yes, that's more what I had in mind. Yes, Isaiah has some very good passages. What is it, Nancy? Uh, excuse me, ma'am. The little girl is here. All right. Show her in. What youve been waiting for. About the sermon, Reverend. Yes. Now, the transiency of life. That feeling, ephemeral vapor, it appeared and it vanished. James, the New Testament. The perishability of our mortal bodies. You want me to weave a theme of this into my sermon? Well, let me tell you what my father said to Reverend Moffet. Yes, what did he say? He said that you only have the congregation for one short hour a week. And there are six long days of mischief for them before you get them again. Aha! I see your point. Strike hard on Sunday the excessiveness of Gods wrath... and hope they carry it with them a few days into the week. - Exactly what I mean. - Oh, yes, yes. Well, come in, young lady. Let's meet each other properly. I'm your Aunt Polly. How dc you dc? This is the pastor of our church, Reverend Ford. How dc you dc? Well, there's a family resemblance. She looks very much like her mother. Mother always used to say I look like you. Would you be good enough to stand erect... and in a proper manner, please? And where in the world did you get that dress? It came in the missionary barrels. Missionary barrels? - Yes, her father was a minister. - Oh. As a matter of fact, he was a missionary in the British West Indies. Tsk, tsk, tsk. Pollyanna, this is going to be your new home, and I hope youll be very happy with me. I'm very sorry about the dress, Aunt Polly. My father said it was a size too big... but that I should be glad it wasn't a pair of boys trousers. Well, that's hardly anything to be glad about. Well, my father always used to say that people- Yes, well, never mind what your father used to say. Supper is at 6:00 sharp. And no one is ever late for meals at this house. - Yes, ma'am. - Nancy will show you your room. I'm very glad you sent for me, Aunt Polly. - Your home is very lovely. - Well, thank you. It must make you awfully glad. Glad? That youre so very rich. Honestly! Did I say something wrong? Well, let's just say there are about sixty-eleven things... you could have said besides that. I run a clean kitchen. No shenanigans in here. And you clean up after yourself, you hear me? Yes, ma'am. - You sure it was Doc Chilton? - Mrs. Tarbell saw him first. Coming back after all these years. D- Does she know yet? Old blabbermouth Tarbell will see to that. Now, mind what youre doing, and dont spill your milk. Now, come along. And you hurry up and change your clothes and get back here. - I need your help. - All right, all right. And if you see Angelica, tell her to come down here too. Okay. Leaving me all alone here. I'm very pleased to have met you, Mrs. Lagerlof. Now come along. Hello. What's his name, please? His name happens to be Elizabeth. Oh, youre a girl. Youre lovely. Now, leave her alone and come along. H- How dc I address you, please? Well, just call me Nancy, same as everybody else. Oh, and this is Angelica. She's the upstairs maid. How dc you dc? Psst! Psst! At the back porch. - You know who. - Now? Oh, for heaven's sake. Oh, Angie, would you show her to her room, please? Oh, I still have two rooms left to dc. I can't- I'll help you with the bedrooms in the morning. - Oh, all right. Just this once. - Thanks. Will you get out of here! I've got work to do. Get up to your room. I turn my back for one moment, and what dc you dc? You disappear. - Now, dont spill that milk. - Yes, ma'am. Just got through cleaning up this hall. Yes, ma'am. What are you doing now? Who lives in all these? There's no one lives in them. They're just there. - What for? - That's what being wealthy is. You sure are a question-asker, aren't you? Now, hurry up. Come on, come on. Dont dawdle. - Well, what's the matter? - Nothing. Oh, stuffy. Not much of a room, is it? But it's my own, anyway. I'm glad of that. Oh, and the bed's soft! And it's got a lovely window. Whos that man down there with Nancy? None of your business. Just make sure youre dressed in time for dinner. Youd think she'd dc better than this for her own niece. Almighty God, we thank thee for thy bounty. Grant unto us the grace ever to live in dread of thee. And bless this food unto our nourishment... that it may strengthen us to dc thy will in all things. Amen. Oh, I'm sorry. Nancy, would you bring another glass of milk, please? Yes, ma'am. M- My clumsy clad hand. Well, now, there's no harm done. Did you find your room satisfactory? Oh, yes. It's very nice. Thank you. You hadn't mentioned it, so I just wondered. I've never had a whole room to myself before. I must be higher up in the house than anyone, aren't I? Well, I'm not used to children's noises around the house, and that's the reason I chose that one. Oh, I'm- I love it! I really dc. Really. Aunt Polly? Do you ever have steak and ice cream? Are you complaining about the food? Oh, no. It's delicious! I just wondered. I love steak. Father always used to say that if we ever had the money you have, we'd have steak and ice cream three times every day. Pollyanna, I think we ought to get one thing straight right now. I dont want you constantly quoting what your father used to say. Do you understand? Nancy? I thought I made myself clear about gentlemen callers. Ma'am? Now, dont pretend you dont understand me. I saw you and George Dodds out in the summer house. George has been every inch a gentleman with me, and it's not any of your- We won't discuss it. If you want to remain on my staff, I dont want you to see him anymore. Do you understand? Yes, ma'am. This is no concern of yours. You can finish your supper, Pollyanna. I n the fall, I'll introduce you to Mr. Bainbridge. He's the principal of our school, and he'll decide what grade youre to be in. Pollyanna, I think we should talk about you... and your position in this community. Do you know why it's called Harrington Town? My mother said it was named after my grandfather. That's right. And everyone in this town looks to us to set a good example... in the way we conduct ourselves, in our duties and manners, in what we think, and even what we say. So, we must be good examples for everyone in everything we do. - Is that clear? - Yes, Aunt Polly. Just remember our family position... and conduct yourself properly and modestly. Oh. You mean what I said before? I understand that now. I'll never say that again. You understand what? About the money. I'm not supposed to be glad we're so very rich. Huh? Well, um, I think it's time for you to get ready for bed, young lady. May I kiss you good night? - Please? - What? Kiss you? Mmm, I love you, Aunt Polly. Uh, uh, just a moment, please. Come back here. Turn around once. That dress is disgraceful. Tomorrow we'll go into town and get you some decent clothes. Store-bought? But of course. Where else would we get them? Out of an actual store? New clothes? Youre a Harrington now, and I want you to look like one. Yoo-hoo! Pollyanna! Walk up the stairs like a lady, please. Store-bought clothes. What dc you think of that, Elizabeth? I wonder if she meant new petticoats too. And new garters and stockings and underpants. Dont tell anyone, but it's wonderful to be so rich, isn't it? All right. I'll put most of them on the front seat. Move that yellow one, Thomas. No, not here. That's the good one. Nancy, somethings come up. I'm going with Mrs. Tarbell. Would you please take Pollyanna home? Yes, madam. Oh, I'll take that box, Pollyanna. Now, get into the car, miss. Oh, Pollyanna, will you please get into the car? We've simply got to get home. Oh! George, stop it! Oh, Pollyanna, you dont know my cousin Fred, dc you? Your cousin Fred? This is Pollyanna Whittier, Miss Harringtons niece. - The one whos come to live with her? - Oh. Oh, that one. Hello, Pollyanna. How are ya, honey? - Fine, thank you. - Good. Well, uh, how about this? Running into you after all these- What's it been, six years? Say, hows your ma and pa? Well, they're just fine. You know, Pollyanna, I dont take too much to relatives, but this girl here, she was always just like a sister to me. I tell ya, I love this cousin. Will you cut it out? Uh-huh. Well, look, uh, what are you girls doing? Howd you like to go get a great big dish of ice cream, huh? - Oh. - No, that's a rotten idea. She probably hates ice cream, doesnt she? Oh, probably. Who me? Oh, no, I love it! Really? You do? Well, now, isn't that astounding. Howd you ever develop a taste for that awful stuff? Oh, no, really! I really do love it. Well, I know a wonderful place. Come on, girls. Follow old cousin Fred to the land of strawberry frappe. Unless youd rather go down the street and have a beer. Youre funny. Hey, you two get down off that truck right now! How many times I told you to keep away from the fire engine? Jimmy Bean, I'm not gonna tell you again. Get off that ladder. You see, right up there, under the eaves. Well, just beyond the window there is where it first- - Howd it happen? - Oh, the pipe's busted, Mayor. Both them boilers went up at the same time... and before we knew it, we was up to our necks in water. - Mr. Geary! - Uh, coming. Excuse me. Well, the children are safe, thank goodness. I warned you about this and told you we should dc something! Now, perhaps, you'll listen. I've asked everyone to meet at my house, and we'll discuss this calmly. A fine orphanage this is. Water pipes busting all over the place. Oh, Dr. Chilton. Doctor, could you have a look at Mr. Geary's arm, please? Oh, just scalded it a bit. Of course. Is there a dispensary here? Yes, Doctor. This way. I wonder what's going on. Listen, miss, before we go in, it might be just as well not to mention about the ice cream to your aunt. My father told me never to tell a lie. Pollyanna. I didn't mean to tell a lie. But there's no reason to bring up the subject if it isn't mentioned. I mean, about cousin Fred and all. I like your cousin Fred very much. Oh, he's all right, I guess. He's very handsome, and he has a nice smile. But there's something sort of, I dont know, funny about him. What dc you mean, funny? I know what it is! It's his name. He doesnt look at all like a Fred. - What? - He looks more like a George to me. Pollyanna, wait a minute. Pollyanna, I told you to come directly home. I know, Aunt Polly, but... When I tell you to do something, you must do it. There are rules... Where have you two been? It's almost 1:00. Well, um, you see, ma'am... Have you been carrying on with George Dodds again? Oh, it was my fault, Aunt Polly. What dc you mean, your fault? Well, I-I just dawdled so. It was the excitement of the new dress, I suppose. Polly, before Karl Warren gets here, we must talk. Oh, I suppose you're right. Nancy? Nancy, get into your uniform and help with the luncheon. Yes, ma'am. And this is no place for you, young lady. - We have lots to do, so run along. - Yes, Aunt Polly. I'm sorry to start your vacation off like this, Ed, but this won't take long. Dont worry about me, Uncle Karl. I'll just wait out here. Fine, fine. Oh, Frieda, Bessie, they're waiting for you in the conservatory. Right in there, ladies. Why, Edmond, this is a surprise. - Well, if it isn't young Dr. Chilton. - Mrs. Tarbell. I'll see if everyone's ready for you, Polly. Thank you. It's nice to see you again. Are you just visiting? Well, I thought it was time for a vacation. The first one in five years. I'm just waiting here for Karl. I won't be in the way here, I hope. No, no. Of course not. Seems strange being back here again like this. Polly, they're all ready for you. I'll be right there. Why dont you come in and Join us? No, I'd rather not butt in. I'll wait here. Well, they're waiting for me. Go ahead. I'll be fine here. - Hi, Nancy. - Hi. You better get out of here. Oh, I'm all right. It should be parliamentary procedure. Same as it always is. Well, for once, let's have facts. We've always observed regular procedure. Oh, bunkum! We're here because of an emergency. - Everybody will be talking at the same time. Exactly. They'll all be standing up trying to get the floor. - Hello. - Hello. Is this the town meeting? Oh, no. It's in there. I n the conservatory, for heaven's sake. Oh. Are you a member of the Ladies' Aid group? Oh, no. I'm just a child. I'm not even supposed to be here. - Shh. - What's your name? Pollyanna Whittier. That's my aunt over there, the pretty one. This is her house, and I live with her. - Shh. - Shh. Wait just a moment, everybody. We'll compromise. We'll go to the immediate problems first. Good. Amelia, wouldn't you like to hear what Karl has to say? All I'm saying is that it's time we took some pride in that orphanage... and put up a decent, presentable building that we could all be proud of. That's all I'm saying. And I've been saying it for three and a half long years! See, he's always trying to get the floor. No, I'm not at all. Now, now. No, I'm not! H- Here, now- Polly, he's completely out of line on the whole thing. Here now, if we'd all be a little more quiet, cooperative, orderly. If we'd all stop shouting and cooperate- There is nothing wrong with that building! All it needs is new plumbing. Today the plumbing, tomorrow the roof and the Lord knows what- Excuse me, Reverend. Who knows what's gonna happen next? You were very happy when my father donated the building to the town. Oh, for Pete's sake, Polly Harrington, listen to reason! It's a dilapidated old relic! The dining hall, the dispensary. Even my nephew, Dr. Chilton there, he noticed that. Ed, tell them what you said. Well, I dont think I should say anything. No, no, now, tell them what you said. I want them to hear it. Well, I got a look at the dispensary when I fixed Mr. Geary's arm, and I mentioned it seemed a little inadequate for 32 children. There you are. Now youve heard it. We all thank you for your interest, Edmond, but it's an equipment problem. We're talking about Harrington House, which is a landmark in this town, and I intend to see that it stays that way. We'll spend more to repair that old building than to put up a new one. It won't cost this town one cent! My father donated the building to the town, and I will stand the cost of pipes, plumbing... or whatever it is that's necessary. It's my duty, and I will not shirk it. I suppose there's not one of you out there that has the gumption to say what you think. Is there? What about you, Reverend? Youre a man of influence in this community. - What dc you think? - No, no, no. I, uh, I never take sides in these matters. Oh, that's comfortable. Ben, speak up. Come on. Oh, Karl. Charlie, what dc you say? Well, say something! Anybody! We do have other business to discuss. - That is if youve finished, Karl. - Oh, yes, I've finished. There's your whole town council and your whole city conscience! You certainly dont need me as mayor around here... as long as youve got Polly Harrington running everything! Karl never changes, does he? Ladies and gentlemen, we're having a little light lunch. Suppose we stop for a while and have a bite? If you ask me, Reverend Ford should have taken sides with Mayor Warren. He had the chance, and what'd he dc? Said he never takes sides. Stop sticking your nose into their business and get these sherbet glasses out there. We're out of spoons. Well, wash some up. Dont bellyache to me about it. Youre in a fine mood, aren't you? Pollyanna, I thought you could use this for your room. Oh, thank you, Nancy. Oh, it's gorgeous! Oh, well, thanks for not spilling the beans about you-know-who. - About cousin Fred, you mean? - Mm-hmm. - Isn't he handsome? - I knew it all the time. - You did? How did you know? - It was easy. I saw you holding hands under the table. If you ladies got nothing better to do than sit there gossiping and snickering- Well, we're just talking, Tillie. Well, talk on your own time. This sherbet's turning to mush. All right. All right. - Nancy? - Hmm? - You know that man? - What man? The one at the train station. The one that was just here. Well, what was he to Aunt Polly? Well, you might say they used to be friends... sort of. Do you think he's gonna marry Aunt Polly? Whos gonna marry her? She means Dr. Chilton. Hah! Fat chance. Whod wanna marry old pickle-faced Harrington? Nancy. Are you and George gonna get married? Oh, we hope to someday. Oh, I am glad. I think everyone should be married. And maybe, when you dc marry George, Aunt Polly will see how happy you are, and she'll be very glad to get married herself, then. Glad this, glad that. Do you have to be glad about everything? What's the matter with you, anyway? Oh, lay off her, Angie. She's not hurting you. Oh, the way she goes on. Now, that's enough! You heard what she said. Stop picking on the girl. Now, take that sherbet out and serve it the way you should. Go on. Well, let's see what your aunt has on the menu for tomorrow. "Roast chicken." Chicken every Sunday. Your aunt has no imagination. Oh, I love roast chicken! I'm glad tomorrow's Sunday. Ah, wait 'til tomorrow. You won't be so glad. Did you ever hear of sour stomach? Well, Sundays around here give folks sour stomach for the whole rest of the week. How come? Wait 'til tomorrow. Youll find out soon enough. Praise Him all creatures here below Praise Him above ye heavenly host Praise Father, Son And Holy Ghost Amen. Death comes unexpectedly! And the God, Jehovah, will execute his vengeance on ye... who despise His dying love and trample His benefits underfoot. The unconverted soul, the foolish children of man do miserably delude themselves in the false confidence... of their own strength and wisdom. They trust to nothing but a shadow. But bear testament. Death comes unexpectedly! Now, you say, ah, no, I had not intended it to come now. I had laid out matters otherwise. I thought my scheme good. I intended to take effectual care, but death came unexpectedly... like a thief, outwitting me, too quick for me. Oh, cursed foolishness, that I had fathered and pleased myself... with vain dreams of repentance. But sudden destruction caught me up... and now He will deal with you. Now the Great King of Heaven and Earth... will abolish and annihilate this pride! Will crush the hardened wretch... of the polluted infinite abomination, and rain on him... a deluge of fire and brimstone! And where is their strength, then? Where are the great Leviathans who defied God then? Where is their courage, these, these, these, these proud spirits? Yes... death comes unexpectedly. And the dread judge has the key of hell. He shuts... and no man opens. In hell... you will be reserved in chains of darkness forever and ever. This place of atonement, of damned souls and misery, with nothing to relieve you, no comfort, no water for your parched tongues, no place to rest or take a breath, but the everlasting, infinite convulsions of misery... forever! And ever and ever! Now, Isaiah has warned us, on the day of vengeance, the earth shall be laid to waste. And the cormorant and the bittern shall possess the land. The raven and screech owl shall dwell in it. Dont stare at the orphans, Pollyanna. And who is man... to think he can withstand Gods mighty wrath? Great mountains cannot stand before this wrath. Yea, He can lay the earth to pieces in one moment... or shatter the whole universe with one stroke of His fiery sword! How dreadful is the state of those who are in daily danger of this great wrath, this abyss of death and despair. Yet, this is the dismal case... of every soul in this congregation who has not been born again, however moral or strict, sober and religious you may otherwise be. There is no security for the wicked... because there are no visible signs of death at hand! Unconverted men walk over the pit of hell on a rotten covering. And there are innumerable places on this covering so weak... they will not bear their weight. And these places cannot be seen. The arrows of death fly unseen as noonday. God has many different unsearchable ways of taking the wicked from this world. Who here in this congregation listening to this discourse... will soon be visited by this covenant of darkness? There you are... sitting there, calm in your knowledge of health, secure in your well-being. Yet who could suffer the agonies of the damned tomorrow? Yes, even today... or maybe the next hour, the next minute. And if we were to know which of you it was, what an awful sight it would be. A soul... doomed to the everlasting bottomless pit... of a divine wrath! Yes, death comes unexpectedly! Amen. Exactly. I thought the reference to Jeremiah at the finish was very effective. - Didn't you, Mrs. Ford? - Yes. I, um, sometimes wonder whether it's necessary to talk so furiously at them, though. Dear, Isaiah, Jeremiah and Ezekiel... all recorded with faming pens and power. I can't deliver the message with syrup. Of course not. Your voice is Gods instrument and should be used accordingly. Well, we try our best. What'd I tell ya? He sure sermonizes something fierce, doesnt he? Brimstone and damnation on top of ham and eggs! The one day a week we have off. I hate Sundays. Ooh, I just hate them! Breakfast still a hot ball in our stomachs, and him chewing our ears off from that pulpit! We get to have roast chicken, though. I'm glad of that. Are you gonna start that all over again? Glad this, glad that. What is all this ''glad'' business you talk about? Oh, just a game I play. What kind of a game? A game my father taught me. Helps sometimes. Helps what? When things aren't going so well. - That reverend! - Huh. Away from the peas! Go away. Folks Just hate the coming of Sunday because of him. Do you know why I hate Sunday? Because it means the starting of another week. That's true. That's when you could play the glad game. Here it comes- Miss Goody Two-Shoes... is gonna find something about Sunday to be glad about. - Oh, lay off her, Angie. - Oh, stop it! If you knew how to play the game, then you could find something to be glad about too. But you dont! All right, Miss Smarty-Pants. What's so good about Sunday? - Well, there's always something. - Huh. You could be glad because- Well, because what? Because it will be six whole days before Sunday comes around again, huh? That kid. Hi. Why dont you come out of the front door like normal people? They won't let us. I can come out anytime I want with my tree. You can also fall and hurt yourself badly. You shouldnt play in trees. That's stupid. Dont you believe in God? Of course I dc. But what's that got to dc with it? He grew it there, didn't He? So I can climb out anytime I want. Youre much too young to go around discussing things you dont know anything about. He did too! Why else would it be there? Shows youre very Juvenile. You aren't so much, you girl! 'Sides, I'm something you can't be. I'm an orphan. Go away from me, please, little boy. ''Go away from me, please, little boy.'' What is it you want? I wanna go fishing. You wanna come along? Aren't you supposed to use a hook? I don't have a hook. Oh. Hello. Well, look whos here. How are you? Fine, thank you. Caught anything? Not yet. What was it you and my Aunt Polly fought about? Now, where did you hear about that? Oh, just around. But they won't discuss it when I'm there. Uh, would you mind telling me what it was? Well, Pollyanna, it's a strange thing about arguments. At the time they seem very important. But now... you know, I can't even remember what it was about. Aunt Pollys very pretty. Yes, I think she is. Dont you? Yes. I just said so. I love her, but I dont love the way she fixes her hair. Years ago she used to wear it long and soft down to her shoulders. It was very soft. It must have been beautiful. Yes, it was very beautiful. Did you used to be in love with her? Come on, Pollyanna, let's go. Reverend Ford and his wife are with Aunt Polly now, but they'll- but they'll be leaving soon. I suppose Aunt Polly will be alone by herself most of the afternoon. Well, I- I better be going now. Good-bye. - You wanna know something? - What? Trees are the best things in the world. You can hide up in 'em, and people dont even know where you are, and they're walking right beneath you. - I never thought much about it. - Well, they are. - You wanna see something? - What? Come on. I'll show ya. It says, ''Keep out.'' Shh. Youve gotta keep quiet. You see that place? - What about it? - That's old man Pendergast's place. He's the meanest man in town! Well, what are we doing here? Shh. Keep quiet. Come on, Pollyanna. This is his old wet basement with rats in it. He hates kids. If he catches ya, he throws ya down in his basement... and keeps ya for his slave. Then what are we doing here? Because I wanna show ya something. There it is. Up there. The best climbing tree in town. Isn't it a beauty? Well, of all the stupid little Juvenile tricks! Do you mean to tell me that you brought me all the way up here... Just to see a crummy old- a crummy old tree? Wait a minute, Pollyanna! - Dont ya even wanna climb it? - No! Well, would ya give me a boost? Aw, come on. Please. All right. All right. Up this way. More. Come on. Higher. A little bit higher. Just a little bit more. Little bit... higher. Right- Right there. What are you doing here? - Look out! - I've gotcha! Lemme go! I've got you, you little vandal. Come back here, you little girl! Come back here! You wicked little boy. I'm gonna get the constable this time. - Lemme go! Lemme go! - Just shut up! I'll teach you! I'll teach you a lesson you won't forget! Come here. - Lemme go! - Come on. Lemme go! You pay attention to me. I want you children to understand that I do not want you on my property! Keep away from me! Lemme go! - Pay attention to me! - You big bully! I've told you 50 times to keep out of that tree! You hear me? You keep away from me. I wasn't hurting anything! I'm going to call the constable this time and see that you keep off my property! That's all there is to it, do you hear me? Stop it! Stop it! Stop it, you mean old man! You let him go immediately! Oh. You came back, did you? Who are you? My Aunt Polly will send for the police, and they'll find us in your old rat-filled basement, and youll go to jail! Oh, they know about me, do they? Everything. All about the children youve kidnapped and turned into your slaves. Serves 'em right for trespassing on my property. We weren't hurting anything. We just wanted to climb your old tree. You fall out of that tree and get hurt, and I get sued by your parents. I dont got any parents. I'm an orphan. Well, before I pitch you into the basement with the others, - what name do you go by, boy? - Jimmy Bean. Jimmy Bean. I like to keep a record of your name, you see, Jimmy, so that I can tell ya from the rats down there in the basement. - Lemme go! - Come back here! Oh, no, you dont. You come back here. - What am I going to do with you? - I dont know, sir. Well, it was getting too crowded with kids in that basement, anyway. All right, I'll let you go this time, but youve got to promise never to come bothering me here again. - You promise? - Yes, sir. Crocs your heart and hope to die? All right, get out. Get out! Go on. What are you waiting for? - You know what I think? - No. What do you think? I dont think there's any kids in your old basement. I think youre just a big bluff. Oh, you do, do you? Well, put that down! What are you doing touching things? Dont touch anything. These are my things, and I dont want them touched. Just looks like a lot of old dusty junk to me. Well, you wouldn't know anything about that, anyway. Youre nothing but a child. Imagine criticizing a beautiful antique of this kind. Ugh. Never heard of such a thing. - Howd you do that? - What are you talking about? That. How do you make it? Dont you know anything? I didn't make it. The sun made it. That's prismatic reflected light. Where from? Where from? Well, uh- Oh, from here. - You see these hanging crystals? - Mm-hmm. The sun's rays hit it, and it acts like a prism. You understand? - Sure, I understand. - You do not. You dont know what a prism is, now, admit it. It makes a rainbow right on your wall. Isn't it beautiful? Yes, but when the sun sets, it'll be gone. So stop carrying on so. Sure, but it'll be back again tomorrow when the sun comes again. - You have to admit that. - I dont have to admit anything. Hmm. Well, I better be going back home now. Well, good-bye, Mr. Pendergast. It was very nice meeting you. And thank you for showing me your house. But I didn't show you my house! You came barging in here! Good-bye. Kids. Kids today. Well, you always were unpredictable, Edmond. Hello, Polly. Coming here like this without even calling. Uh, won't you sit down? - Could I get you some sherry? - Uh, no, thank you. I ran into your niece down at Walker's Creek. We were talking about you, and I thought, why not stop by and say hello. Why, that's very nice. I dont know why Pollyanna would be at Walker's Creek. Oh, she was playing. She told me youd be alone today. There were so many people around the other day, we hardly had a chance to talk. Yes, well, I'm sorry that meeting got out of hand like that. Who have you seen since youve been back? No one. You knew that Carleen Donnelly got married, didn't you? No. You remember her brother, Beckett Donnelly? - No. - Of course you do. - You two used to argue all the time. - Well, I'm sorry, I dont. Well, it really wasn't that important. I know what I'll do. I'll give you a welcoming home party. It might be nice to see some of the old faces again. I know that Gary and Nell would love to see you. Do you know that Nell has eight children? It's the fifth one- - Polly? - What? I'm not very good at parties. Please dont. Well, I just thought you might like to see some of your friends. I came back to see you. Well, that's very fattering. A busy person like you remembering me. I came back to see if you were married and what had happened to you. No, I'm just the same. - Nothing has changed. Everything is- - We made a mistake. I came back to see if you felt the same as I do. Oh, but it's been five years. - You can't just pop out of- - They were wasted years. Tell me about your work, Edmond. We've heard that youve opened a clinic in Baltimore. And we're very proud of you. What was it you mentioned yesterday about the orphanage? - I don't remember. - Oh, yes, you do. It was something about the dispensary. It's inadequate for that number of children, that's all. Well, I want to modernize it. Will you help us? J just tell us what we need, and I'll buy it. It's a civic responsibility. Why should you buy it? Well, it isn't as if I couldn't afford it. What does that have to do with it? Well, it's because I want to. I feel I should. After all, there is an obligation to having wealth. Haven't you learned yet that people dont like false charity? Well, I dont want to talk about it anymore. I dont know how we got off on the subject. Well, it isn't the way I wanted it. Perhaps I should come again another time. Yes, perhaps you should. And maybe you should call first. Yes, I'll do that. Pollyanna, look at your new dress. It's filthy. And your shoes. Oh, I'm sorry, Aunt Polly. I was playing, and I didn't realize. What were you and Dr. Chilton talking about? Oh. Nothing. We were talking about your hair. - My hair? - Yes. He said you used to wear it very long and soft down to your shoulders. He said it was beautiful. Ah, yes, well... clean yourself up for supper, dear. Yes, Aunt Polly. Here is the last of the calf s-foot Jelly. Oh, but, Aunt Polly, please- There'll be no nonsense about it, Pollyanna. This is a duty and a Job that must be done. And Nancy will show you where the deliveries are supposed to be made. - What kind of deliveries? - Charity baskets, child. - Oh, the suffering in this world. - Dwell on it. Appreciate how lucky you are. Now these two go first, Nancy, and handle them with care. Now, where is the one for Mrs. Snow? Oh, we took great pains to wrap that attractively, knowing how she is. - Yes, ma'am. - And there'll be no dawdling. And keep your clothes clean for a change. Come on, off with you. Come on, honey. We've got three more to go. Oh, just a minute, Nancy. What's in the darn thing? Um, I think that one's calf s-foot Jelly. Oh, you dont have to look at it as though it was charity. Just a gift from one friend to another. - Friend? - Yes, I'm your friend. Well, uh, I better be going now. Good-bye. People sure hate to get charity. - Isn't it the truth? - And I dont blame them. Do-gooders. Hah! - Good-bye, Miss Ferd. - Good-bye. - Now, how does that go again? - Um... Barly one morning Just as the sun was rising Barly one morning Just as the sun was rising I heard a maiden singing I n the valley below One up. Barly one morning Just as the sun was rising I heard a maiden singing That takes care of Mrs. Gaupherson, Miss Neely, the Doppsils and the Ferds. - Whos left? - Just this one. Mrs. Snow. And I wish this one were over with. What's wrong with her? She's just plain crabby, that's what's wrong with her. You never met anyone so cantankerous. If it was Friday, she'd wish it was Tuesday. What did we bring her today? Uh, calf s-foot Jelly. You wait and see. She's bound to wish she had chicken. And if we brought her chicken, she'd want lamb broth. She's just cantankerous! Millie? Nancy, come on in. - How are you? - Hello there. - Hello. - Uh, this is Pollyanna Whittier. Oh, sure. I heard you were coming to stay with your aunt. And this is Mrs. Snows daughter Mildred. How do you do? How do you do? Where were you last night? We waited and waited. At the hayride, I know. My mother said I could go, and at the last minute, she changed her mind. She had come kind of, I dont know, upset stomach. Stop that noise in there! Haven't you any respect for a dying woman? Oh, honestly. She was so crotchety today. I'm just worn to a frazzle. This morning I fixed her a cup of coffee as usual. You know, I brought it in. She didn't want coffee this morning. - This morning she wanted tea. - I dont know how you stand it. I dont know, either. Had to make her a new cup of tea. Remember the day I brought the currant jelly? Yes! I had currant jelly from here to there. She threw it at you! - Hello. - Who are you? And what're you doing in my bedroom? - Uh, uh, I'm Pollyanna Whittier. - Who? - Miss Harringtons niece. - Oh. The Ladies' Aid has sent me with this. - Yeah? What is it? - Calf s-foot Jelly. Calf s-foot Jelly. Oh, and I had my heart set on lamb's broth today. You mean chicken, dont you? What's that? Well, they told me you always wanted chicken when you were brought Jelly. Youre a Miss I impertinence, aren't you? Come here. Come right over here. You have a stubby little nose. What do you think about that? I know it. I wish I were pretty like you. Oh, dont you try to butter me up. I'm not at all pretty. Oh, but you are. And you dont look sick at all. Well, that shows you what a stupid little girl you are. Go on. Get out of my way. Why, I'm right on death's doorstep. Just hanging on by sheer willpower. If you had to lay here day after day and day after day, and youd call anybody, and your daughter- Put that down! Stop it. And she wouldn't come. She's gallivanting somewhere. And the doctor, all he gives you is pills. Just pills and bills, that's all. - What are you staring at? - Your prisms. - My what? - Your prisms. Did you know they paint rainbows on your wall? Oh? See? On that wall over there. Howd you do that? I said, I'm too old and smart for that old saw, Fred Pallegrew. Well, I should say so. You turn that horse around and head out from underneath this covered bridge right now! I'll bet that cocled his heels. You shouldve seen his face. - More coffee? - Oh, please. It's awful quiet in there. I wonder what's going on. More to your left. To your left, you silly girl. What's the matter with ya? Now, there, there. - That's not bad at all. - Not bad? It's gorgeous. I think it was a fine idea. Dont be taking credit. I suggested stringing them up there. Why, Mrs. Snow, that's a fib! It was my idea. It was my idea to use the string. You didn't know how to do it 'til I suggested the string. Youre impertinent. I dont like you at all. I'm sorry. When are you coming back again? Tomorrow, I guess. I'll see you then. Well, if I'm not in my grave. Bye. Bye. All right, Nancy. - Good-bye, Millie. - Good-bye, Nancy. - Good-bye, Pollyanna. - Bye. Don't stand there. Go on and fix a cold pack for my headache. Go on. - Go on! - Yes, Mother. Let's get some gumption around here. Let's start acting like a community. Hey, Doc, you just sit there chewing on that straw. Put in your two bits worth. What do you think? I came here to fish, Charlie. I dont want to butt in to your affairs here. Ben Tarbell! Where you sneaking off to? You folks are biting off a pretty big chew with all this talk. Come on, Ben. Get it said. A lot of us have got vested interest in the Harrington companies. Our wives belong to her Ladies' Aid group. My woman would skin me alive if I was to go opposite to Polly Harrington, and that's the truth! I'm sorry. ?tiuq ot tnaw esle ydobynA !won ti oD All right, let's get our hands out of our hip pockets and find a way to raise some money. Are you with me? Barly one morning Just as the sun was rising I heard a maiden singing in the valley below What's happening? That's first thing in the morning. Charlie Gorman, that means eight men assigned to you for carpentry. - Dan Seymcor'll supply the 1- by-12s. Right, Dan? - Right. Mary, youve got to get that cocking done. Of course, youve got that other thing to run. Yes, Karl, I'll take care of the chicken. - Hi, Pollyanna. - Hi. I'll be back in a minute, Nancy. - Hi, honey. - Hi. What's going on? Lady, you are looking at the elected head of the entertainment committee. Old Uncle George. - Entertainment committee for what? - Well- If we get the corn, you can take that whole thing out of there. You can count on me to haul in that lumber! Use the big truck. We're gonna have the best bazaar youve ever seen. We sure are. - A bazaar? - to raise money for a new orphanage. It's the first time folks have stood together against Polly Harrington. Did you know there's going to be a bazaar? Yes! With corn on the cob and ice cream and everything! Can kids come, George? Well, of course they- George? Now, where'd you get that name? Oh, stop. She's known it all along. And you didn't tell your aunt? Well, what did you think I was, a snitch-baby? - Youre a good girl. - When's it gonna be? Sunday night, a week. Let me tell you about it. What a night. An extravaganza. And I'm in charge of all the entertainment. Picture it, ladies. Darkness. And out of the night, 50 bicycles appear moving down the square. And hanging from their handlebars, 200- 200 gorgeous Japanese lanterns. Hey, Pollyanna. Wait for me. Where are you going? There's a big bazaar, and I'm helping. Hey, wait a minute! What's it for? It's an extravaganza. Picture it. Darkness. Fifty bicycles. Two hundred gorgeous Japanese lanterns swinging. And I'll be on the lead bicycle, riding right out in front. Oh, boy! Can I help? All right. Come on. - Where you going now? - Mr. Pendergast's. Youre going back? Youre nutty. What are you doing back here? Oh, just came to say hello. Tell you something about your prisms. Well, what about them? Well, aren't you going to invite me in? Invite you in? No more privacy than a goldfish. All right, come in. But you can't stay long! Can he come in too? - Can who come in? - Jimmy Bean. Come on! Don't be a scare-baby. Oh, come on! Dont touch anything. Well, why didn't you just invite the whole town while you were at it? Oh, I just wanted to show Jimmy the rainbow on your wall. - Do you mind? - Huh! All right. Go ahead! Go ahead! Kids. Drive ya crazy. It's getting so a man can't call his home his own anymore. And where do you think it comes from? Through this little piece of glass. - Explain it to him, Mr. Pendergast. - I've got work to do. Dont you know anything about refracted light there, boy? It's the sunlight coming through- I'll do the explaining if you dont mind, little Miss Know-It-All. Now, boy, you see here the- Dont they ever cut your hair in that darned orphanage? I like it the way it is. Look at you. So much hair, you look like youre wearing a coonskin cap. - Lemme go, will ya? - Anyway, about the refracted light. Oh, yes. Now, pay attention, boy. You see the shape of this crystal? That is a prism. The light is tripped by that angle. That refracts the ray, splits the colors, defuses them at an oblique angle... and bends it out into a dispersed color band. You understand? What he means is... the sun comes through here and paints a rainbow. You see? Oh, I understand. Can I try it once? Please? Go ahead. But dont break anything. Do you know Mrs. Snow? Well, I've just come from her place, and we strung a whole bunch of them up across her window. You should see what that does. - Let's try it. - All right. Oh, no! I've got work to do. If we had some wire or a piece of thread, we could string 'em up across the whole window. Oh, we could, could we? Do you kids think I've got nothing better to do than to play silly games? Well, dont stand there looking at me like that. There's string in that box over there. Go and get it. Oh, dear, dear, dear. Oh, my goodness! - Look. - Yeah. Look. See over here? - Look on that door. - It's on the door. Can you see? Look. Oh, it's gorgeous! The most beautiful room in the entire world. It's not bad, is it? It's not bad at all. That dining room looks awfully gloomy. Why dont we do the same thing in there? - Oh, boy, let's go! - No. What do you mean, ''no''? I thought you enjoyed it. Well, it's what I came to see you about, Mr. Pendergast. You see, they're having a big bazaar in town, and they're trying to raise enough money to build a new orphanage. - I like the old one. - Be still. Anyway, they need help, and everyone's supposed to bring somebody else. And I want to bring you. What for? They're having all kinds of stands to sell things: hooked rugs, quilts and crocheted tablecloths. And we could have a stand and sell these- rainbow makers! I'll bet everyone would buy one. I never go into town, and I dont believe in community projects. But they need you! They need me? Of course they are sort of attractive little things, aren't they? I just wonder if folks would buy a thing like this. I wonder. Now, I'm not trying to sell you the brass, but it is durable. Well, the silver's pretty, and I think youre right about the brass. Oh, I dont know. I just can't make up my mind. Of course the effect of silver is always in good taste. Hello, Mrs. Snow. Well, where hare you been, you naughty girl? Oh, I'm sorry. I've been helping for the bazaar. - Hello, Mr. Murg. - How do you do? What have you got there? Dont bring those dirty rags in here! - Get them off my bed! - Oh, they aren't dirty rags. They're patchwork squares. Mrs. Gaupherson made them. I thought, perhaps, youd like to stitch them together... to make a patchwork quilt for the bazaar. - What an impertinent child! - Listen! You just take them right out of here! I'm not going to do anything of the sort! But everyone's helping: Mr. Neely, the Julians, and even old Mrs. Thurm. Oh, she wants me to work in my condition. Dont bother Mrs. Snow, girl. She's a very sick woman. I thought it might give you something to do instead of just lying around. I mean, the bazaar's for an awfully good cause. Well, it's a waste of time. Nobody'll come to it. You wait and see. - That's right. - Why not? Because of your aunt. That's why not. Well, I dont understand. Well, we do. Dont we, Mr. Murg? - Indeed we do. - Mm-hmm. Good. Well. Now, about this white satin. I think it's lovely. This is my first choice. - And I think the best one. - Yes. It'll look lovely against the brass handles. Are you having a dress made? Don't be impertinent. I'm picking the lining for my coffin. That's right. But youre not gonna die! Does she have to be here? Go on into the kitchen and talk to Mildred. Now- Now, this satin is lovely. Well, it's all settled then. Thirteen yards of the white satin... at $ 1.20 the yard. And the brass coffin handles. Well, all right. All right. Write it up. Stop frowning at me like that. What's the matter with you? Well, it's just that- Well, a person shouldnt think about dying so much. - I dont want you to die. - Oh, bless you for that. Seems everyone else can't wait. I'm not supposed to talk about my father at home, but I guess it's all right here. My father used to say, ''A person should think about living.'' Why dont you go outside and play? Hush up. I want to hear what she has to say. - Yes, Miss Snow, yes. - It just reminded me... about my father and the doll. You see, I always wanted a doll, but we never had enough money for things like that. My father was a minister. But surely he could afford a little thing like a doll. Well, he couldnt. We had to have the money for food. - Oh, for heaven's sake. - Shh. So, anyway, my father wrote to the missionary people... and asked them to please send a little secondhand doll. Well, it was a funny mistake. When the missionary barrels came, instead of a doll, they sent a pair of crutches. Well, of course I was rather disappointed, so my father made up the glad game! The what game? She's been pestering folks all over town with this sunshine and happiness thing. Hearts and flowers. Enough to make you sick. Hush up. I want to hear it. Certainly. Anyway, about the crutches, my father said, ''Dont let's be gloomy. Let's try and find something to be glad about.'' So, we made a game of it. The glad game. - The glad game. - Shh! So, anyway, we played the game and after a while, I forgot about the doll and being gloomy. And you know what? I found a reason for being glad. Well, there's nothing happy about a pair of crutches. Well, we were glad that we didn't have to use them. Why must you bedevil... this poor dying woman with your childish, silly little stories? I just thought she could play the game! You could be glad you dont need this horrid old coffin! You could help others by making the patchwork quilt for the orphans if you wanted! You ought to forget about dying, and be glad youre living! Oh, I dont care what you do. I'm not going to come and see you anymore. I- I didn't mean to hurt her feelings. She's serious about it, isn't she? Oh, please, please, Mr. Murg, leave me alone. I'm sorry if I've- Please. Please, leave me alone. Ben told me yesterday they've been organizing. About 50 of them. And Ed Chilton's got a finger in the pie too. Edmond? Gave them the idea, is what he did. And that's not all. It couldnt have been Nancy. I tell you she was there. Jesse told me. Well, I'd fire that girl so fast, it would make her head swim. And that child! Your own niece! Helping them. Pollyanna! Just a moment. Mrs. Tarbell tells me youre involved with that bazaar. Well, I won't have it. But, Aunt Polly, I'm part of the fag! We won't discuss it. I dont want you to see those people anymore. And that's an order! Yes, ma'am. The blessings youve heaped on that child, and her working with those people against you. Get down my cake tins, Angie. We're going to work. Doing what? Thinks she's the queen of Sheba, does she? Well, she can't stop us from helping with that bazaar. We're going to bake cakes, dozens and dozens of them. Where you gonna get the ingredients? Where do you think? Oh. Youre getting paid, aren't you? Not to be kicked! He kicked me in the stomach. Now, Jimmy, youve got to stop kicking Mr. Hooper and sit still! I dont wanna get my hair cut! Hey, Jed, get that hammer out back, and we'll nail his shoes to the chair. - Mayor. - Mr. Pendergast. You should be ashamed of yourself, Ben Tarbell! I paid for the tickets. Will you let it go at that, Karl? - I just can't show up at your affair. - You ain't the only one, Ben. What do you mean by that? Claire, I just came from your newspaper office. What's the matter with those fellas? They said they couldnt handle this ad for our bazaar. Will you go over and straighten them out? Now, take it easy, Doo. Our space is all sold, and I can't go around- Tell them the truth. Why lie to the man? Youre a coward. It isn't Baltimore up here, Doo. This is a small town. You know as well as everybody our newspaper is owned by the Harrington family. Liver-bellied bunch of miserable sheep! Now, take it easy, Pendergast. It's the way things are. I say that youre all chicken-livered, and I'm sick and tired- Just a minute, just a minute! The thing is this. Most folks here make a living out of Polly Harrington some way or another. We can't afford to antagonize her. Can't afford to antagonize her? Just dont be surprised if come Sunday night nobody shows up at your bazaar. I dont believe that. Well, youre coming, aren't you? Claire? Charlie? People are just plain scared to, Karl. They're afraid of Polly Harrington paying 'em back later. - She'll do it too. You know her. - Now, look. We've all taken a cut or two at the Harringtons, but she wouldn't do a thing like that. If you think I'm intimidating a whole town- Oh, Polly, you know what I mean. No one will make a move in this town without the Harrington stamp of approval. Oh! Karl Warren sent you, didn't he? He knew no one would cooperate without me. Nobody sent me. I just wanted it made clear you dont mind if the others cooperate. You needed my help. Why dont you admit it? Won't let your guard down for a minute, will you? Still suspicious. Still dont trust anyone. Nothings changed, has it, Polly? Youre still as opinionated as ever. If that's what you mean. Oh, Angelica. Dr. Chilton is leaving. Keep busy, Polly. Lots of meetings and civic duties and obligations. It's a poor substitute for what's really wrong with you. I knew I could count on you for some lofty clinical observations. Would you like to be paid for your diagnosis? This one's on the house. There's no medical term for it. You can give everything but love. It's as simple as that. - Angelica. - Mum? See that the flowers in the conservatory get fresh water. I found them dry again today. Yes, mum. Did you hear how he told her off? Like water off a duck's back to her. That woman's got no feelings at all. How'd it go, Ed? Stubborn, mule-headed woman. Just like her father. I shouldve known better. - What did she say? - A lot of foolish nonsense. What she really wants is for us to go begging to her. Get her sanction, permission from the queen to gather in the streets. - Hi, Nancy. - Hi, dear. - What's the matter? - Oh, nothing. It's a doggone shame after all the work folks put into it. - Is the bazaar off? - It looks that way. - Why? - You wouldn't understand. - Is it because of Aunt Polly? - Yes. It takes a word from someone who isn't under her thumb. Fat chance you got, Ed. She's got her finger in nearly everything: the bank, the mills, the paper, real estate. Harrington Town, a fine thing. One woman owning a town. Well, like it or not, that's what she does. - Nancy. - Yes? - She doesnt own the church. - That's right. What did you say? Um, I just said that nobody could own a church. Our social structure in this small town seems to teeter on a delicate balance, one which I certainly cannot in any way attempt to influence. A man of God cannot be taking sides in these feuds. But all we want is a word from you, Reverend. No. Just let the people know tomorrow you're in favor of us. I won't use that pulpit for public announcements. Then youre siding with her by not mentioning it! I am not. I'm staying completely out of it, and that's all there is to it. Reverend Ford, if youll just let us say that youre in favor. There's nothing more to discuss. - This is all just impossible. - I'm afraid youre right. Thank you, Reverend Ford. You see, I- Of course you understand that... personally I think it's a good cause and all that, and I wish you luck with it. Thanks a lot. I guess Pollyanna was wrong. Now, what has she got to do with this? She said nobody could own a church. - Hello, Mrs. Ford. - Hello, dear. - What are you doing here? - Aunt Polly sent me. Uh, something for Reverend Ford. Oh, he's just back up there. Oh, yes, I saw him. Thank you. - It's a lovely day, isn't it? - Yes, it is. And he sayeth unto them, the wicked shall be punished! The wicked shall be punished. Their poison is like the poison of serpents. But they shall feel the gall of asps within them! How many times have I stood on this pulpit... and warned you, cautioned you again and again? A house divided against itself cannot stand. A kingdom divided against itself can be brought to desolation. If you are an enemy to one another, then you are an enemy to God! Am I reaching out to you? Do you understand my words? Well, week after week, I stand here... reaching out to you, begging you to understand. Yet week after week, the same wickedness persists! The same dissension, the same belligerence, the same feuding... until you are 10,000 times... more abominable in the eyes of God... than the most hateful, venomous, violent, vicious- You. What are you doing here? Oh, nothing. Um, I mean, I was looking for you. Uh, Aunt Polly sent you this. - Now, what is it? - Uh, I dont know. I'm sorry I disturbed your practice. Would you like someone to practice your sermon on? No, thank you, child. Uh, Mother and I used to be an audience to my father... when he was practicing his sermons. - H-He was a minister, too, you know. - Yes, yes, so he was. Uh, do you like being a minister? Do I like being a- Now, why would you ask a thing like that? Oh, the way you looked just then reminded me of my father. Once I saw him sort of sad like that and I asked him. And what did he say? Oh, well, he said he was glad he was, but it made him sad sometimes... when he just couldnt seem to get through to his congregation. Sounds familiar. I suppose every minister of God faces the same problem. Mmm, I suppose. Tell me, did your father ever solve the problem? Well, he read something one day that he said helped him. I n the Bible? No. Just something he read someplace. He had it put on this chain. He wore it always. It's all I have of his. ''When you look for the bad-'' Ohh! It always makes me cross-eyed. - May I? - Mmm. ''When you look for the bad in mankind expecting to find it, ''you surely will. Abraham Lincoln.'' He was the president. Yes, yes, I know. But I never heard that before. Neither had my father. Anyway, he said it started him thinking. And from then on, he was going to look for the good in people. That's when we both started searching through the Bible for the texts. The texts? Yes, you know. My father called them the glad passages. You know, the happy ones... like, um, uh... ''Shout for Joy,'' or... ''Be glad in the Lord.'' You know, like that. There are 800 happy texts. Did you know that? No, I didn't know that. Yes, well, there are. And, you know, my father said, ''If God took the trouble to tell us 800 times to be glad and rejoice, he must have wanted us to do it. '' Oh, I better be going now. I'm sorry I disturbed your practicing. I'll see you later. Uh, good-bye. Good-bye, Reverend Ford! ''Dear Reverend, ''I've taken the liberty of Jotting down a few thoughts... ''and some text from Matthew... which I thought you might want to use in your sermon tom-'' Oh, my God. What have I done? What have I done? Dear, are you all right? Nobody owns a church. No one. Apoorypha. Boolesiasticus 30. Paragraph 22. ''Gladness of the heart is the life of man.'' Now, this is one of the rejoicing... or happy texts. A young member of our parish pointed out to me... that there are 800 such happy texts in our Bible. Well, she was wrong. There are, to be exact, I know because I stayed up most of last night counting them. I intend to read one of them every week. And that should take us, according to my calculations, through 16 years, if I'm around here that long. Well, I can promise you this- If I am here, our visits with God on Sunday are going to be happier... and more rejoicing too. Uh- Now, what I have to say now... is very difficult for me, but it must be said. I look out to you now... and realize... after four years in this congregation, I dont even know you. I look out to you now not as my congregation, but as people, and I say to myself, how sad it is to have missed those four years. Four years when we could have been friends. I should have been looking for the good in you, and I... I failed you. And I apologize for this. God is forgiving, but it's not Gods forgiveness I beg, it is yours. I'm not going to speak about this anymore now. It's a lovely day outside, so let's go outside and enjoy this Sunday for a change. And while youre out appreciating the sunlight, Just give a little thought to whos sending it down to you. Stop it, please! One more thing, please. Please, sit down! Please, just one more thing. I'm sorry. But there's to be a charity bazaar in the band park tonight. It's for a good cause. And, um, I want to go on record as being 100% for it. So, let's all go out there and have ourselves some fun because, um- Well, if youre not there- Let me put it this way. If youre not there, I'll lam into ya something fierce when I get you in here next week! And you know I can do it too! We've been needing that. Where's Pollyanna? I dont know. I haven't seen her. Be careful when you put those in the car. Dont you smudge that frosting. Keep your fingers outta there. Shh, shh, shh. Nancy? Angelica? Shh. Shh. Where's Pollyanna, please? She's gotta be there. It's a big bazaar tonight. Pollyannas gotta be there, or she'll ruin the fag. Well, Pollyanna is too young to be out alone at night. Couldnt you bring her? No, I could not. Good night. Jiminy. Oh! Pollyanna! What are you doing up here? Youll fall. Youll fall and kill yourself, you big silly. You gotta come. Youll spoil the fag if you dont show up. I can't. Aunt Polly won't let me. Come on. She'll never know. Don't look down. - I dont think I want to try it. - Come on. Give me your hand. I'll help you across. Come on. Basy. Basy. Real slow. Grab that for me. All right. Dont look down. Are you sure it's safe? I'm sure it's safe. It's ripe, it's lovely! There you are, folks. The finest watermelon at a penny a slice. You cannot have finer. There's the best you could possibly have.

Everybody else is dressed and waiting for you. But I never got a chance to have any fun! Oh, come on. Yes, youll win yourself a beautiful doll. A beautiful doll if ya fish in the fishing pond. Step right up, folks! I am not going to budge. I've had just enough of your nonsense. Youre going to join in with the others and make this a town, not a dynasty. Get down out of that car, Amelia! I'm warning you! Move! Good evening, folks. Come on and fish and wish for a surprise! Now, you have to think about what you want and wish very hard. I understand. I'm wishing. Do you know what you want? All right. Hey, there she goes. The young lady's going down after it. What we gonna get there? Come on. Step right in there, folks. Fish in the magic fishing pond. Everybody step right up here. It's only two cents. Drop a line, and fish for your surprise. It's the most exciting game at the bazaar. Come on, folks. Fish and wish. Get your bamboo pole here. Two cents. Hey! Lookee there! The little lady just pulled up- Oh, my gosh! Look! She's mine. Oh, how did they know? Right here, step right up. Well, Reverend, show 'em how to do it. No, I haven't pitched since my college days. Hey, Reverend, bet you couldnt hit the broadside of a barn. Yaaaaa! Who is that? Charley MacAndrews up there? - What about it? - Here, hold this. Ah, leave your coat on. Youre not gonna hit anything, anyhow. Buy some corn with the money. You know, I've been trying to get you baptized for the past three years! And he throws... and misses again! Look out, look out, look out! I did it! Oh, beautiful for spacious skies For amber waves of grain For purple mountain majesties Above the fruited plain America, America God shed His grace on thee And crown thy good with brotherhood From sea to shining sea Oh, beautiful for spacious skies For amber waves of grain For purple mountain majesties #Above the fruited plain #America, America God shed His grace on thee And crown thy good with brotherhood From sea to shining sea Take you home again, Kathleen Across the ocean wild and wide - Thank you. Good night. - Good night. Thanks for the ride. Where your heart has never been Since first you were my bonnie bride The roses all have left your cheeks My heart just fades away and dies I'll take you home again, Kathleen I never! The way they bought up those cakes. It's a lot of money for that. - What is it, mum? - I thought I heard something. Lord, have mercy! Oh, my goodness! Oh, Angelica, call the doctor quickly. Oh, my God. If you dont mind, I'd like to speak to all of you in the salon for a moment. Nancy, when Miss Pollyanna feels better, I want you to move all of my clothes and my personal belongings into the next room. - Yes, ma'am. - I want her to stay where she is. It's a larger room, and it has a much nicer view. And it looks as though she's going to have to remain there for quite some time. You might as well know that Pollyannas legs are paralyzed. She doesnt know it yet, and I dont know exactly how I'm going to tell her. I... just dont know how I'm going to tell her. I came as soon as I heard. How is the child? Pollyanna! Come on down and play! Pollyanna! We'll go swimming. Want to? - Pollyanna! - Boy! Boy! Boy, boy, stop that. Stop that. Now, you go away from here. But I want to play with Pollyanna. Pollyanna can't play because she's had an accident. Now, you go on home like a good boy. Go on, hurry up. Go on. Hurry up. Go on. God works in ways mysterious to man. Dont speak to me about God! Say what you think! I can see it in your eyes. - They blame me, dont they? - No, no. Nobodys blaming you. But it's true, isn't it? I could have been the least bit understanding. That child lies up there because of me. Polly, the mercy of God is forgiving- Oh, what kind of a merciful God could allow a thing like this to happen to a child? And if He were merciful, why did He let her come to our town? Let me tell you something, Polly Harrington. Sunday a miracle happened in this town. Oh, this town! Yes, this town. Right out there in that street the people are smiling at one another. Go on, take a look for yourself. It's very contagious. Just think, Polly. If she had never come to this town- We ought to get down on our knees and thank God for sending her to us. Excuse me, mum. Dr. Chilton wants to see you. Now, you understand everything I told you, dont you, dear? And there's nothing to be afraid of. - What is it, Edmond? - I told Pollyanna about her injury. She understands. Dont you, dear? We're gonna take you to Baltimore for an operation so you can walk again. You hear that, honey? Now, why dont we all cheer up. Let's see if we can't find something to be glad about your staying in bed. Um... ch, I know! This way we can all have steak and ice cream! Did you know that your aunt ordered it for you? Now you find something to be glad about. We'll play the game. Well... I suppose I could be glad because- Yes, go ahead, darling. No. It was a silly game. I hate it. I'll never want to play it again. Leave me alone. Please try to understand, Pollyanna. Youre such a part of our lives now. Nancy and Angelica, Mrs. Lagerlof. And I love you as if you were my own little girl. Won't you give me that chance? Please? - Put these in too, Mr. Thomas. - All right. And tell Dr. Chilton that the car's all ready. Yes. Yes, we're leaving immediately on the 11:30 train. Well, check the arrival schedule. Make sure we're met with an ambulance. I want complete X rays the minute we arrive. Yes. Thank you. Is the operation dangerous? Yes, it's very delicate. Youre coming, aren't you? I need your permission to operate. Edmond. There's something worrying you, and I want to know what it is. We can only do so much with surgery. A great deal depends on her. This depression she's got herself into, that's what's worrying me. Edmond. She's had a shook. She's just learned about her legs. I can't have her despondent like this for the operation. - Well, you have to give her time. - Time? There is no time. I have to move her, get her into the hospital, and I dont like it. What that child needs is a good shot in the arm of hope. Hope? What she really needed was love. And that's something I never gave her. We can still give her that love. You and I together. Mum, mum, there's something very peculiar happening outside. Miss Harrington! They'll- They'll ruin our fewer beds! - What are you talking about? - Across the lawns and the flowers. W- We've gotta do something. I've gotta stop 'em. I've got to get 'em out of there! That's what I've been trying to tell you. Been trying to tell me what? Oh, not the begonias! Oh, my goodness. Them's Miss Harringtons favorite flowers. Now, please, folks, go around the other way. Dont come through there. You can go around that tree. Now, look, go around over by the driveway! I- Oh, the heck with it. What is it you want? We dont want anything. We just come to say, ''Howd ya do?'' to the child... and bring a bit of gladness into her life. Like she brought into ours, God love her. We just want her to know she's got friends, lots of them. Give her our love, and we'll get off your private property, Miss Harrington. Oh, no, uh, wait. Why dont you tell her yourself? Open the doors, Nancy. Nancy, pen the door. Come in, won't you? Nice to see you. Hello. How are you, Mr. Neely? Just fine. How are you? Hello. Won't you come in? Oh, what beautiful flowers. Hello. I'm so glad you came. Hello. You have a few callers downstairs, young lady. What? Are you going to greet them with that mopey old face of yours? I dont wanna see anyone. Well, Pollyanna, youre not gonna have much choice in the matter this time. Oh, no, please, I dont want to see anyone. Just easy. Youll be all right, dear. I know. You get well now, you hear? It's not charity, just a gift from one friend to another. Oh, thank you, Mr. Neely. Hi, honey. Youre going to be fine. Dont you worry. Good-bye, darling. We're going to visit you in the hospital. Hey, snookie. Take a look at this, will ya? Really? You mean, really? You did it! Oh, Nancy! - It's gorgeous. - Isn't it? And we're going to wait for you. Youre going to be my flower girl. I'm glad youll be coming back to us, darling, and that's the truth of it. The house'll be miserable without you. Miserable. You hurry back to us. Best wishes, Pollyanna. Good-bye. Good-bye, Angelica. Hurry home to us. What is everybody sniffing about? My goodness. A bunch of ninnies. Think a person couldnt get well. - Hi, Mrs. Snow. - Oh, bless you. Bless you, darling. I'll see you soon. - Thank you for coming. - It's all right. - Bye. - Good-bye. Hello, Pollyanna. Hello, dear. We have a surprise for you. Shall we tell her now, Jimmy? I've been adopted. Adopted? Who? Who? Well, who do you think? We're gonna spend the rest of our lives just hanging prisms. You hurry home and help. Hello, Mrs. Ford. Hello, Reverend Ford. We looked for the good in them, and we found it, didn't we? Aunt Polly? - Bye, Pollyanna. - Bye-bye. - Bye-bye. - Bye.
