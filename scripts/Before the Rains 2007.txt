Thunder always gives me a jolt. I fear they've begun shooting here, too. Go, go, Nin ja Turtle! Kill him! Take it easy, kid... Time never dies. The circle is never round. I wanted to take a vow of silence, like you. But this heavenly beauty merits words. Bullets! Run! God help us! Good night, son. God be with us. Sshhh! Don't hit me, please. 'Don't give me away. Speak to me. Are you mute? You don't speak Albanian. I don't speak Macedonian. What are you doing here, son? A midnight stroll? All right, I need a piss, too. Come on, Kiril. What are you doing there? I haven't got all night. My name is Zamira. You are a good person. Welcome. Thank you, Father. Well, Mitre? We're looking for an Albanian girl. - She killed my brother. - God rest his soul. The children say she's hiding here. We've only had refugees from Bosnia, Moslems. We're all equal in God's eyes. Remember five centuries of Moslem rule? Father, you're one of us. Give us the Albanian girl. There's no girl in my monastery. - We'll search it. - No. We must! An eye for an eye! Bad blood. Turn the other cheek. We have. Wait outside. - Has anyone seen her? - No, Father. I just want to know if she's here. We would have told you at once, Father. Kitty, kitty... No one? Father Kiril? Have you seen a girl here? We would have told you; it's a sin. So, she's not her, right, Father Kiril? Welcome. - God sees everything. - Forgive us, Father. Might is right. - We won't do anything to you. But when we find her, she'll be sorry. Well? She's not downstairs. - What's upstairs? - Father's Kiril cell. Come on, Father. You shouldn't do this, Mitre. For your own good, Father. Come on. Stojan, make sure no one to leaves. There's nothing here, children. This is a sin. An eye for an eye. Albanian whore! Stojan, under the bed. We'll find her, even if she hides in America. So you're hiding a Moslem in God's house. Speak. Kiril hasn't spoken for two years. He took a vow of silence. Mute? Deaf, too? I'll fuck her Albanian mother, too. You, animal! I'll wait for you outside. - I win, pay up. - Give me some brandy. - Let's get his gun. - He's crazy, he'll shoot you. - Can I hold it? - Here. Run! Run! "Yeah, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death... ...I will fear no evil: For thou art with me." Shame on you! Deny thy father. Give up thy name. Good luck to you both. Thank you, Father. Forgive me. Kitty, kitty... Shoot, cousin! Shoot! We'll go to my brother in Skopje, he will help us. Then to my uncle in London. He's a famous photographer. I don't understand you. No one will find you. No one. You don't understand me, do you? No one. Grandpa! Where were you yesterday? Answer me, you slut! Where were you yesterday? Did you go to the sheepfold again? Did you kill the shepherd? Answer me. Did you kill him? What the hell were you doing here? Blood calls for blood now. Did you forget what I told you? I never hit you. Never. I locked you up in the house. I cut your hair. Should I shave it off? Who is he? He saved me, Grandpa. He saved me. Did he, you bitch? Whore! Slut! He loves me. He loves you? He loves me. He loves you, eh? Let's see. Let him go. Let him go! Clear off! Run! Don't. Don't! Sister, no! Forgive me. Go fuck yourself. I love you. Motherfuckers. I want to speak to Alexander Kirkov. I'm sorry, but he's gone away. Would you like to leave a message? No message today. Thank you. Where are you calling from? Not bad, and you? - Killing myself here. No problem. Do you need money? Take this money. Send it. What? Money, money... I give no shit... Suck it. Look at our people. The driver will see you smoking. Don't worry, he's my uncle. Have one. - I gave up. - Come on, relax. - I'm off to a harvest. You? - To a baptism. Whose? - Mine. - You're joking. My nephew. Nice. How long since you were here? Sixteen years. I ran away twenty-four years ago; I only came back once. Do you mind? Your wife? She died... in a taxi. Why come back now? Don't you see what's going on here? You'll be sorry when someone chops off your head. I won't. It's about time. Where are you going? I'll shoot. You'll hurt yourself. Oh, you're one of us. Stop. - Where to? - To see Bojan. Son of Trpe, the innkeeper. Anyone at home? Give it back, they cost a lot! Go home, you little shit! My uncle Mitre will sort you out. I'll tell him... Tell him to suck my cock... gently. Good afternoon. Good afternoon. Fucking hell! It's him. Look at his camera, it's from Germany. Man of the house! Quite a gun you've got. Can I see it? You little brat. You can't catch me. Don't do that, son. Let the kid go. Hit me, cousin. Aco! You old bastard! I didn't recognize you. A beard and a half. - Older, too. When did you get here? - Last night. - Where did you sleep? - In my old bed. I'll wallop you. You should have dined and slept at my house. Aco, Putziler Prize - winner. It's been a hundred years, you donkey. Only sixteen. Mitre? Hi. You took that from my nephew? I should have smacked him. Put it somewhere safe. Hell with it. Give us to eat. Here comes my wife, Neda. Cheers and welcome. Thank you. To long life. Let me say something. May we gather again next year... ...with a bride. He's got many brides in England. - Cousin, do you see ever see Hana? - Forget about her. She's Albanian. Aren't there enough of ours for you? - What does that matter? - Her father will cut your dick off, then it will matter. Her husband died last year. She's got a beautiful daughter. Where have you seen her? She hangs around the sheepfold. Don't be stingy, bring her over some time. Damn Albanians, they breed like rabbits. They'll take us over. Stop talking rubbish. No one's taking over anything. - Cousin, have a cigarette. - No thanks, I've quit. Don't be silly. - No, Zdrave. - How long are you staying? - For good. In that case we'll help you fix up your house. The roof and the windows should be mended. Fix it? Just look at their house. Aco, take a picture of us. Hangover? Hangover, yes. Who are you? I'll come to you. Are you Kate? You never knew when to stop. To stop, or not to stop? Full stop. Perfect. Don't. Still dreaming of Hana? Still. She's a widow now. I'm a divorcee. - Are you? And you? Me? I'm a schoolteacher. Have you got anyone? Sleep. You need it. Good day. Good day. Where are you going? To Hana's. Hana Halili. What for? She's my friend. From school. I haven't seen her for sixteen years. I want to pay my respects. I've brought presents for the children. I mean no harm. Tell her it's Alexander, from London. Ask her father, Zekir. Go. Sit down. You've gone gray, too. Welcome. Have you come from far? Very far. How do people live in the world? Good, if they know how, same as here. Welcome. The times... they're no good. They used to be better. Blood is in the air. It's stuffy. It should rain. It must, sooner or later. For the children. This was for the husband. I didn't know he'd passed away. Last year, in a car accident. God rest his soul. This is for you. For me? Like in American movies. Sitting Bull. Come in, Hana. Help yourself. Thank you. Go away! - Welcome. - Thank you. My grandson, Ali. Kiss his hand. Why is he here? - Say thank you. - He doesn't belong here. Take the gifts to your sister. He doesn't belong here. Get out! I'll slit his throat! Mother, Father, forgive me. We're having a wedding without you. Be joyful... If you only were here to share our happiness. Rest in peace. Hello? What's up? What's up? Hey, old man. I want to speak to Alexander Kirkov. There's no such person here. Who did they want? Nobody. Come on. You beauty! Shit. What is it going to be, a boy or a girl? It doesn't matter, as long as it's a boy. Come on, my dear. Where did you get to yesterday? I got as drunk as a skunk. - It's good for your liver. - What liver? Long gone. You forgot how to drink in England. You've got the sexiest girls there. Congratulations! Bojan, fetch brandy. - We already have one here. Come on, fetch the good stuff. He wasn't this worried about his wife. What a bore this cousin of yours is. I video-tapped a programme about you: Our man made it in the big world. Vietnam, Beirut... - Vietnam was before my time. Same shit. - Are you tired? - As if I'd left yesterday. Everything is the same. I feel good here. Comfortable. America, England, where they don't shoot... ...that's where it's comfortable. They shoot more there. You can't imagine the killings I've seen. "Will these hands ne'er be clean?" They won't start shooting here. People are peaceful. They used to say that about Bosnia. Now the world's watching a circus. Waiting to kill each other. - I was in Bosnia. - And? Bad, huh? An industrial in jury? Are you tired? I'm tired. There's no reason to fight here, Doc. They'll find a reason; war is a virus. We split in two: Our village, their village. People give nasty looks. I'll go and see Hana. - Where's Bojan? - You've just missed him. See her, but behave yourself. Keep it in your pants. Come to Auntie, my dear. Let's go. Hurry! Where? Let the damned Albanians rot on a pitchfork. One of theirs. Whore with a pitchfork. The children saw the Albanian slut with him this morning. - I'll strangle her myself. - And then what? Keep out of it, you're not from here. We'll be at the sheepfold. Take it. It's time to collect. Five centuries of our blood. Take it. Poison yourself. Did you see guns? - Yeah. You haven't seen anything yet. This is only the infantry. Politicians are all we need now. Where is the UN now? Back next week, to bury the dead. Have a nice war. Take pictures. You know what? You're crazy, too. Correct. I'm still here in this asylum. Hana? It's me. How are you? Bad. Tell me. My daughter is missing. Your cousin. - Zdrave? - Yes, Zdrave. Do you see what's happening to our people? I see. You just watch. Help me. As if she were yours. Cousin. I almost killed you. Shame on you. - Why? She is a child. A child. That child killed my brother. How do you know? There's the police and the law, let them decide. You left long ago, you don't know how it is here now. Live your own life. That's why I'm here. I couldn't live with myself if I let you do this. Cousin, wait a minute. Aco, come back. Aco, I'll shoot. Do you hear? - Aco, I'll shoot. - Coward. Alex, I'll shoot. Shoot, cousin. Shoot! Run! Run! Run! Whore! Shoot, cousin. Shoot! Aco, don't you worry, you'll be all right. Look. It's going to rain. You whore! Blind fool. It's going to rain. The flies are biting. It's already raining down there. Come on, it's time. And time doesn't wait. And the circle is not round.
