Never let anyone lean on your shoulder. Never let anyone touch your hands. Thinking I'm a cat. So easy to treat, easy to treat. I will show you a cute pose. Didn't intend to be Chinese-Thai born. Didn't intend to be ... Don't like it? I'm sorry I am what I am. Isn't it too bad? Good, I'm gonna give you full points. Back to your seat please. Who is next? Who wants to cut in line? Who will dare? Are you ready? Just sing the "Chang" song then. Who was that? Khung, do it again to my face! Just want to see your face. I need you. Your face! Hey, Tuang. Khung. What happened? Khung threw paper balls at me, ma'am. Your face! No! Just want to see your face! I knew it. You did this, right? I need you! Love you! Want you! Thosaphol. You are old enough to sing a song. Can you, Sweetie? Come on sweetie, sing it out. Just want to see your face. I need you, love you. Well, get back to your seat honey. Yes ma'am. Well, you little lady, Earn. Giving your friend hints. Your turn then. What's wrong with you!? Not about love. Just want to see your face. Not about liking. Just want to see your face. Not about thinking of. Just want to see your face. That's all. Cause our homes are closer. Just want to see your face. It's all I want. That's all. I need you, love you, Need you, want you. I want to ask you something. What do you call this kind of song? You're asking the right guy, Ped. It's called a rock song! What is a rock song? It's fast! OK, how about a slow song? A slow song is a love song! So, there are only two kinds of songs. Rock and Love, right? No! The two are "RS" and "Grammy". If you don't believe me. Listen to the radio. There are only two of them on the air! Um.. How about Folksong, bros? Thai traditional song, Cha cha cha and Morlam? Is it fast? Then it's a rock! Shit! You're out of focus! Not right! What's wrong with you, Kae? Mom's coming. I'm leaving. Thosaphol. Are you busy? Earn. Earn. Earn. What's up Ped? Your grandmother is coming. Teacher asked me to get you. Earn. Does your family run a cassette shop? You have a lot of music to listen to, don't you? It's good to sell cassettes. But I don't want to sell them. I want to record an album. I'll sell my album in my own shop. Really? It will be fun for the customers. The shop owner on the album cover. Why do you listen to music? Don't know. It's something like having a friend with me. Try this. Before a clear sky. Before the sun's warmth. Before the flowers' blooms. Before a sweet dream. Do you feel it? Earn, your grandmother is here. Yes ma'am. Hey Ped. The song I tried to tell you about. Try it. Show me when you can sing it. - Sawasdee ka, have a good trip. - Sawasdee ka. Hey, when do you want it back? Before this Saturday. I'm moving to Bangkok. Bye. Giving you my soul and my heart. Giving you a compromise. To be next to you. No one is in my heart, Till your love comes. Light up my eyes. No one is beside me, Till your love comes. Drive me to go on. No one is in my heart. Till your love comes. Light up my eyes. No one is beside me. Till your love comes. Drive me to go on. Hey, it's too loud. Why don't you take off your shoes. They're full of dirt. Come on, take a bath and have dinner. Then finish your homework. Hello ma'am. What happened to your face? Nothing. What's up? I'd like to borrow your guitar and songbook. For what? It looks good when you play. And I want to try it too. OK. To stop someone from copying me. Love you, need you. Not about love, just want to see your face. Not about liking, just want to see your face. Not about thinking of, just want to see your face. I need you, love you, Need you, want you. Not about love, Not about liking. Just want to see your face. Hello hello .. May I speak to Earn, sir? Earn? Earn is sleeping. Don't you know what time it is? It's very late. I'm sorry sir. Next time you call people, Be aware of what time it is. Who is calling? Who? It's Khung. Oh, Khung. Khung, it's very late you know. People are sleeping. Don't call this late again. You're late. So good. Next. Tuang, come out. I like to give this song to the new couple of our class. What's a change. What's a change. Can you hear? Ped, Khung likes Earn. Pass it on. What's a change. What's a change. What's a change. To be with Khung. Khung is fond of Earn. No, you misunderstand. Not me. You misunderstand. Khung. I don't like to be teased. And I don't like it when someone messes with me either. Definite misunderstanding. It's not me. Not me. You guys misunderstand. Misunderstand. Has to be someone else. Why Bangkok? Do you believe me Ped? That I didn't make that call? OK let's go home. Come on Ped. Khung where are you planning to go? I'm going for guitar practice. I will play every song. Nobody's cute, Ped. How about the front row? Let's go. Thank you for joining and having some fun with us. Also thanks to Kae. - Where are we going? - Don't know yet. Hey Ped, look at that girl ! - Who? - That girl. Is she cute? Hiding my card! Finished. Hey do you guys know? There's a new girl in our class. What? It's final year. But we still have a new one. Yes, she's a cute girl, damn it. For a very new semester you have to put yourself in someone's business. Don't you want to know who the new one is? Can't you see that I'm busy? Don't mess around. Too old to play like a boy. You just don't get it. This is the time for a card game. When you see her, you'll freeze. If I don't, I'm going to punch your lights out. Yeah, that's the girl I told you about. Earn? Ped. Thosaphol, room 6/1, Angkaseth Wittayacom. Great! You remember him. How about this guy? Yes, are you the guy who played guitar at the senior party last night? I was at the party too. You were great. No, that was his twin, Kae. This is Khung who was proclaimed your boyfriend. And it made you angry. Bang Earn (What's a change) Oh, I remember that. And the song for this one is ... need you, love you. You always remember this shit. OK, I have to go now. We'll talk again, soon. Bye. How cute is she! The more you grow, the cuter you become. Everyone agrees, how attractive you are. The more you grow, the more beautiful you are. Please stop your beauty for now. It's going beyond exceed. The more you grow up , the cuter you become. Everyone agreed, how attractive you are. The more you grow, the more beautiful you are. Please stop your beauty for now. It's going beyond exceed. I thought about it all night! Let's put together a band. How about playing cards? It's out of date. It's a time for a music band. Do you know, how many times you have changed? It's a Yoyo time, man. The end of Yoyo. Yow! Ped, the time of rollerblades is coming. Why can't I get up? Roller blades time is gone. It's time for Dancing now! But this time it's for real. Here, my pick. You should play bass guitar. No, it's enough. You know, man. Girls are fond of Bass players. You see that guy? That's our drummer! He's called "X". Listen to the ball sound. That proves he's cool. See. What amazing footwork. Kicking on the bass drum, so powerful. How about the wrist? It will hit the snare at maximum. Yeah, watch this. The craze to fulfill how the drummer of... Shit! Maybe we should wait for X to recover, then rehearse. It's too late, man. Attention please, this Saturday. At The Central Kadsuankaew Basement. From noon to 3 o'clock. The first live concert of the band 'Khung and Friends'. The band is Khung and Ped class of 6/3. And X from 6/4. Khung exposed the excitement and joyfulness. Cool party for you all. We can't disappoint our fan club. Just strum on the upper string and it'll be OK. Counting, 1 2 3 4. 1 2 3 4, got it? One hour for you. Yes. 1 2 3 4, hello... Ready? Khung and friends, ready! 3 2 1 What are you taking your shirt off for? I'm thirsty. I need some soda to drink. - Some snacks for me too. - OK. Where's mine? 3 2 1 Wait, it's unbearable. - Don't get excited too much. - The shit's in my ass! Sorry, the splint caused some trouble. Hello, yes mom. I'm busy. Why don't you tell Kae? Which sauce? Which formula? How is it different from 1 and 5? Turn off your cell phone now. Wasting our time! Ped! come on. Khung and Friend is ready. 3 2 1... Time's up now. Are you sure? Definitely! OK, now sweeties. We have guests, Khung and Friends band, from Chetuphon School, came to play music for us. Raise your hand if you want to listen. Good. So please applaud loudly for the song called Bubsaba. My name is Bubsaba, ya ya ya... Bubsaba comes with cheerfulness. With flower blooming in her heart. Gathering flowers for a wreath. And the world is so bright with her wreath. - Not Bubsaba of Nicole version? - No. So colorful... So perfumed. Set this world fantastic. Blood! She enjoys making wreath. Daily, day after day. Never boring. Get away! Too crazy! So, Khung and friend. How about it? Oh, bad mood. Better ask Khung himself. The Hot Wave Music Awards is going to open. Will Khung and friend do us the honor of joining? Music isn't for competition. But to make the children cry then? Right? - Ignore him! - Hey, where are you going? Oh, Khung and friend are shy. Hey, are you angry with me? When will we practice again? I don't know. I'm bored. Not out of reach. But it's too far away. Cause you're a close friend. There's no right to tell the truth. Not out of reach. But it's too far away. Cause you're a close friend. There's no right to tell the truth. That I love you. Tell X to meet us at music room now. It's like I said. Music is not for competition. It's for courting a girl, man. Sorry, it's too much fun. Great. I never knew you were good at this. Otherwise I'd have invited you to join us. Like at The Art Master Fair? But I thought it was great. It's groovy. Yeah, right. You feel it. Not bad. See? I told you that we're cool. OK, It's time for school band rehearsal. Stop now. Damn Kae. Didn't your band break up? Yes, this is the new one. Excuse me, this is a rehearsal for the Hot Wave Awards. If you guys are playing for fun, Please leave. We're not playing for fun. We are in the contest too! Really? Surprised? We now have a master class guitarist. Eat our dust! Hey, leave them. Let the amateurs train their lesson. Where are you going? Master Chukiat told me to shoot the new band. How much do you know about them. Tell me. Sure, I will tell you guys now. After the seniors graduated. Kae went to collect veteran musicians of our class. Starting from this Bassist born. Rajchamang. Their drummer hits like thunder. Dome Thunder. Vocal comes with high octave sound. Tem Impact. And Guitarist. Kae himself. Everybody says "Ah.." whenever he plays. The band is named The Arena. I think he read too many comics. Khung. I don't agree with the contest. What a load of shit! No reason to fear. We have Earn. Wait, when did you ask her to join us? I'm in. In Bangkok, I was in a band. And we competed in the Hot Wave Awards. It's the biggest stage for high schoolers. The band that reaches the final round. Also has a chance to release an album. But our band never got that far. And my parents had to move back here, I was sure that this year I'd be out. But when Khung ask me. I was stoked. Don't worry, Earn. Once X is well, we will practice intensively. And we will go through to the contest. He told me this morning. He was bored. What? Nothing. Better go home. What did you say? It's full. Really? Would you like to rehearse at Bakery? Is dad here? He went outside. Didn't you mean Bakery Music? Not quite. Where's your drum kit? Back there. I think this place is ok. Only You. If you look deeper into my heart, there is only you. There is still time for you. You're my soul burns with fire. You break my heart with one blink of an eye. Only by seeing. Already made my heart. As time went by, my love began to blossom. If only tonight I'm yours. Just holding your hand, makes my heart tremble. Was just me and simply love. Will love you forever with all my heart. Only you. I just want to be next to you. At the moment there is only you who danced with me. Our band with Miss Earn is so cool. You talk too much. The rules say... a band has to play 1 of its own songs. How do we start? Ped, you write the lyrics. Forget it, I can't. Don't be silly. You won a prize in grade 8. That's the poet one! Shit! The song has to be a love song without the word "Love". How could it be a love song? Piece of cake. You have to be in love to compose it. But I'm not. So, weren't you really fond of me when we were in grade 6? Are you hiding something? Say it! That time... Don't interrupt, man. And... Our classmate teased that Khung was fond of me. But it's Tuang who was a liar. Why both of you, then. One night... someone called me late at night. And said he was Khung. Not the time to play, man. But I didn't call you. So, I have to apologize. For getting mad at you. It's OK. It's in the past. By the way, do you have a boyfriend? Why? If you have one, you should compose the song. No. I don't have one. You're not fond of a girl, are you? You're crazy! I see you are tough like a man, so... How about you, Ped? Fond of somebody? This dummy's never been. - How do you know? - I spend a lot of time with him. - I never saw him courting anyone. - Are you sure? Yeah, haven't found anyone special yet. And you, X? No. Of course! Dad! X is fond of a girl called Som. Som, ah.... That's it. Dad, No! One day, I heard some sound from his room. Som, ah..... At first, I was worried about him. But after seeing that. It was so clear! How dare you, in the middle of the day. You can borrow my movie disc. For next time. Don't listen to my dad, the story is ... I was too shy to talk to her. So I just look at her photo. But when my orange juice spilled, I couldn't help crying out. Som. Ah..... I used tissues to wipe it clean. Then I was going to dump it. And there was dad standing there. That's all! There's more, son. Have you heard the Donut story? Please go on. - The client was waiting in the shop, I ... - Dad. Come on, it's teenage talk. - No, dad! - I walked pass the toilet... Dad, go down.. - You can ask me later son. - Go down. How about this way. Let X compose the lyrics, he was in love. You don't know, man. The one who's in game will never see the vision. You stalk him, watch the way he courts. And write it down. This morning is so bright. Here she comes. On a cool breeze, I'm coming too. Walking to you my angel. Wash my head, that's so good. Cool me down. Hammer on nail, seeing you swing your arm. So impressive, kick out your leg. Swing your arm. Keep nailing Oh shit, she's coming. Make up mind, stand up and .. Get back! .. play basketball. This arena, even full of blood, will never surrender. Punch the belly, the body and the ear. Here she comes, my angel. Eyes meet. Oh, my god. Stop! Seeing stars. How is it? Really bad. I didn't see X do anything. I'm shy. If you like her then tell her. Really? Nothing. How would she know, right? Got it? A girl's advice. - You're a coward. - Yeah, you do it. Show me how you court a girl. OK. After school party tomorrow, Som finishes her dance show. Give her a present, then start talking to her. It's so easy. If I were you, it'd already be done. Liar. Get him. Run away? You're not busy? Your friends need more hands to move something. What present should I give her? Flowers, a doll, something like that. Which word should we use instead of "Love"? Maybe "Like". Missing you, worry or something. It's up to the individual. So, the word for Mr.X would be... "Coward". Right? I recommend "Lust". How about you? Which word you going to use? Maybe "Lovely". No, it has the word "Love". Don't cheat. Yeah, that's right. Here's your material. List of songs without the word "Love" included. In this bag. I think you should do it. ... I don't know. The lyrics should come from a guy's point of view. And.. The vocal should be male too. You better do it. Maybe it's not too hard. Right from your heart. How is it? It's like when you like someone. Didn't you ever like somebody? What's up, Khung? One question! Do you like Earn? No. Are you sure? Yes. How come? Are you sure? Yes. Don't like her. Shit, damn Tuang. He saw you and Earn acting like a couple. What's more, He said that you held her hand. While I carried the drum? Shit! I shouldn't listen to him. This is what you came here for? Are you writing a song? How much is done? - Not much. - Let me see. No, not yet. It isn't done. This song that you heard. Do you know. I didn't write it myself. Have no right to, sweetheart. Do you know who is the one. Just remember, it's you. Is this your idea? Yes. What's it called? Didn't title it yet. ... Well .. Right to the heart. Damn straight to my heart. Damn straight! Shit, I like Earn! I like Earn. You're the first to know. Do you remember in grade school. The rumor that I liked Earn. Her face with tears left a big impression on me. But Earn left for Bangkok. I tried to forget it. But who knew? She is back. It made me sure of how much I like her. You see this. I left it as Earn cheats on me. That's all. I told you what I wanted. Concentrate on your song. And I'll sing it out. A song for Earn. Keep it up, I'm leaving. Standing alone. So lonely. I'm alone. Do you hear me. So lonely. Earn. No, let Ped take it. I bought it, please take it. It hurts my teeth. Thank you. Kae is good. No, Earn is better. That guy acts like an idiot. With a plain face. Does that go for you too? How can you accept that? It's not the same, take a good look. Yes, that's right. Kae is smarter. Earn. Hello, Daddy? Hello? Ped! What's up? After the show, you're dismissed! Why? I'm going to tell Earn my feelings. I better bow out now then. Isn't it too early? I have to finish the song. Thank you, man. If disappointment comes to you. Lost.. .. bullies you unbearably. If it hurts, then cry out. Cause it's only tears. Let tears save you. Let it out, don't keep it in. Cry it out. Till you realize how much you're hurt. If there's no one. You've still got your tears. Believe it. Tears are remedy for your pain. Ped, Khung is calling! Hello. Ped. What's up? Come here, please. Where are you? On a train. I'm going to Bangkok. For what? Have to go. Can't stay here. Hurry up, with your money. I bought a ticket for you. Mom, I'm going to Khung's for a lesson. Liar. What is it? Broken heart for the first love. Is it too early to disappoint. After the dance show. I brought Earn to the sacred tree. If a couple confesses their love beneath it. They will never be disappointed. There, I revealed my secret. Earn. Not best in talk, but love. Give you anything you wish for. - What's this for? - I like you. Instead of accepting. She talked about the band. And I tried so hard. But Earn insisted.. don't even try, please. So I told Earn that I don't want to play music anymore. If Earn wanted it. Earn had better play with others. And then? Earn walked away. You're such an idiot! I'm so glad that you came, Ped. How about X? I called, X's dad picked it up. He said that he'd tell him. Oh, there you are. Take care of my son. It doesn't look good. What's up X? Ped, you know? The Easter egg game. A bear doll for Som! Pen! I tried till the end, my hand almost froze. And I got the bear doll for Som. ... Panda. That tomboy's doll was bigger. Orange juice, beer, cold drinks. Freshen you up. Do you want some? Uncle, how much beer do you have? Oh, lots. Give me all of it. Can you drink beer? Uncle, give me some straws too. You went without saying goodbye, So suddenly. Can't eat, can't sleep .. .. Sugar turns bitter. Makes one hurt to death. Like a tiger with no pride, inevitable truth. If you don't mind .. Excuse me, my friends are drunk. Hey, you guys better respect the bros. One question to ask .. Do you deserve to be the middle guy? Coming in first guy, don't you forget. Cheers to hurt. Sadness causes pain. Cheers to the couple for a long lasting love. Good luck to leaving me, the one you don't want. Bill me for the sadness, I'll pay. Suckers. Khung. Did you come to Bangkok for this? Once in a lifetime for us. Visiting a women's college .. .. is something as important as monkhood or conscription. Som. Earn. All girl's colleges. Whip you all. How about this evening? What's that? Calm down, man. A girl like that always has a cute friend. Over there. What? The cute girl ... always couple with ... Easy! Don't look! Our performance is here. What is this place? Final stage of Hot wave Awards. Time of Music Band isn't over yet. I have to forget Earn. And concentrate on the contest. We will succeed. Me too, I have to forget Som. But I will never forget that tomboy! Ped! Do you have something to say? - Like what? - Things deep in your mind. There's something ... about the song I wrote. Don't worry about it, just one song. We have three guys. To deal with it. Well. From now on, we're all reborn. Leave all disturbances behind. Very soon, our band will be on stage in there. Beyond this door, there's an arena for our heroes. Kala! Clash! Labanoon. Bodyslam! Almost failed, too tired too exhausted. Walking to the dead end destination. Or turn back, if insist on going on. The harder things surely become. I always believed in my thoughts, or could they be wrong? Brother Toon! Bodyslam .. It was me who lost. But Life has to follow a dream. Khung. Through the failures. Where is the end? Even if I keep on walking. Cut! Promo save My Life, cut 2 take 2, end slate! Who let your baby face in? Staff, please. Get these boys out of here. Mr. Toon. Your hand positions are not so good. I need more takes. Brother Toon. My name is Khung, I'll be on stage here. Yes, Brother. My name is X, me too. Brother Toon, I'm Ped. Please forgive my friends. Brother Toon, help me. Brother Toon, please don't listen to him. No one would be pleased to meet you all. Get out please. Brother Toon. Keep my pick with you, one day I'll need it here. Remember me, Bro. - Life has to follow a dream. - Brother Toon. Even if it fails... Let me sing for Brother Toon. I love Brother Toon, remember me ... Our bitter times are over. Our Band is reborn from now on. How we suck! I got a broken heart. X too. Ped didn't. Cause he never courted anyone, damn you. This is the union of losers. But we will not lose. We will 'suckseed' with music. For all losers like us, stand up and be born again. Just like a seed, grows again in this world. I know why The Arena is good. Because they never waste time Doing idiotic stuff like you do. The Arena never stood in my sights. A simple band with a good action. No, nothing. Why are you sitting here alone? Broken heart? No, just broke someone's heart. Khung's always like this. Don't mind him. I won't, but I'm angry, I'm sorry for Khung. Why? Ped didn't do anything wrong. Are you thinking about a reunion? No, please. It will cause chaos. Are you waiting for someone? No. I'll leave now. Earn. By the way, I still want to see you. On an album cover. Time for a real one. How about this one? Signature NC 70, Pro Series. Great musicians swear by it. I want that one. Flying V, smart choice. OK, try it. - Hey Bro. - Yes? Let me try that amp please. Smart choice. This one is perfect. The sound is clean without noise. Distortion also good, plus an EQ built in. Great musicians swear by it. Which foot do they put on it? Don't know, maybe left. Good, I'll use the right. Attention! Hey, you rockers. I love you all. OK, Bro. Oh, finally. Do you want that one? No, I want the bass guitar over there. Smart choice. Are you really buying it for me? No, for myself, you'll just borrow it. When they see the beautiful bass, they will pay no attention to your skill. Take it. Trust me, we are the kings. So cold ... Without you is without warmth. I wrote ten songs, he didn't even approve of one. I want to punch him. Stay calm, man. You know that he's got talent. What? He actually sucks. The band without me, will never get attention like this. Come on, at least we used to play together. Our band does not depend on him. Kae sucks. His face looks like shit. I should punch him into a shit pile. Shit! God dammit! What happened? Come on Khung. Soak him! Why did you say my name? Khung! Is that you? Damn! Wait there! Don't run away! Don't fight, man. I'm not going anywhere, hurry up. I'll hit you with the toilet dipper. Wait, I'm not Khung. I'm Kae. Oh, Kae. That's good! Who are you fighting? Damn it. Tem is not our member anymore. That's your problem. So I don't need to say more. Shit. Let's go! Where? Rehearsal. I'll give back your CDs. Why the hurry? There's no need. Better to return it, Before you move away again. You're silly. How about The Arena? I saw you in your band, sounds fun. It's very fun, Ped. But I have to remind myself, not to call Kae 'Khung'. Earn. How's your song? It's okay. Do you want to keep these longer? It's okay. I better leave. Not about love. Not about liking you. Just want to see your face. Not about love. Just want to see your face. Not about liking you. Just want to see your face. Not about thinking of. Just want to see your face. That's all. Cause our homes are closer. Nothing else, that's all. Just want to see your face. That's all. That's all. I need you, love you, need you, want you. love you, need you, want you. Just want to see your face. Long time since I heard this. Played it? Yes. Is it good? Hello. I need you, love you, want you. Doesn't sound like Sek Loso, does it? Yeah. Ped. I wanna ask you something. What? What do you think of me? What do you mean? Do you like me? Used to.. And now? Not anymore. Okay, then, bye. Wait, don't open it yet. Listen! That song that you heard. Do you know I didn't write it myself. Have no right to do it, sweetheart. Wait wait, let me finish. Do you know who is the one. Just remember, it's you. That's all. This song that you heard. Do you know. I didn't write by myself. Have no right to do it, sweetheart. Do you know who is the one. Just remember, it's you. How was that? Better than I thought. You can do it. It's not for the band. Do you remember the telephone call that night? Khung didn't make that call. Was it you? Why did you have to lie? Your dad's voice scared me. Okay, What do you want to say that night? I like you, Earn. I really like you. still do. I knew it. And what about Khung and you? It's okay. Khung is reborn now. It means he didn't like you at all. And... I also like ... ... this song too. How about me? Guess. - Ped! - Mom! What's wrong with you son? Ped! Where were you last night? Why? I called you all night, your mom said you were out. Where have you been? I'm going to write a song. To brighten up the idea. It's okay, man. I finished it. The content of our song shouldn't be a love song! Cause a girl does ... not deserve our faith. Our song has to communicate friendship. Things that a girl shouldn't get. Perfect! Isn't it too hard? You're still dumb, Ped. I know women. Listen. Women are shit! It's you who's a damn shit! Then women won't be pleased with our song. That's right. You know why, Ped? Because women are selfish! But your mom is a woman too. Shit! I meant teenagers. They always spout drivel. Why does it have to be chicken-oil rice, not duck-oil rice? But I still like women. Do you dislike them? Yes, I do. But I hate saleswomen. This CD is hard to sell. Help me. Buy it please. There is more shit! Enough! I know. I believe you. Good of you to realize. Come on. Hit the road! 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 Go! 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 Yes, 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 .. Earn : Keep on practicing. Women are drivel. Are you sure? It sucks. Yes, freaking sucks. Just like us. Never do the right thing. Hurt. Always lost. Nobody cares about us. Have to stay with pain. Fail to court. Always the last one. Always doing shit. Damn shit.
