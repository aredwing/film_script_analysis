She is asking you to leave. Come. l said get out! We are leaving! ''Excuse me, ma'am. lt is your fault.'' What do you mean?

Breaking legs. l will break his skull! lt is a slow torture! Really? He is exaggerating. What did this dumb man say? He is saying that you are doing the right thing! We can't say that in front of him! See to it that he doesn't survive. lf he survives then we won't survive. Are you encouraging me or scaring me? No. You be strong.

You had seen him in the childhood. ''He used to eat lollypop, used to..'' ..wear half pant and used to do a lot of mischief. Correct. - l accept that you are Sameer. But who are the remaining three? You have come drunk again in this house Pandurang. That is why l was thinking grandfather.. ..that why is he shaking so much. You keep quiet. ''Grandfather, grandfather not three..'' ..but there are four Sameer's. Grandfather he can see four Sameers now. What? What have you mixed Pandurang. Tell me what did you drink? Tell me! ''Grandfather, l did not mix anything..'' ..l swear by my mother. What? You are swearing by your mother after being drunk. ''Grandfather l will show you, l mean l will let you smell.'' What happened? - Grandfather.. ..he cannot even walk properly. lt is useless to talk to him. - Listen.. ..we have to go to the temple. Sameer dear. - Yes. - Will you take us? This Pandu has become useless. You passport size photo. lf you want to live here then mind your own business. ''Sameer dear, today my wish is finally fulfilled.''

Sameer will surely come. ''All the best, dear.'' ''No, because they are blind they..'' ..brought me here thinking that l was Sameer. ''l did not want to hurt them, you..'' ..also please don't tell them anything. For some time even l will get the.. ..love of grandfather and grandmother. ''And yes, best of luck for the dance competition.'' l will pray to Lord that he should make you win. ''Thank you. - Bye. - Bye, see you.'' ''What were you searching for? - Four anas, it had fallen.'' l was searching for it. He is saying that you had not come in this room yesterday. When did he say? ''The wind was blowing, the four anas..'' ..must have come here l will look for it later. ''Listen, what were you searching for?'' ''Me, nothing. - lf l will hit you even once.'' Then you will break up into pieces. l told you that l was not searching for anything. You people. - Have you ever seen a gang? No. - Do you want to see? - Okay.

And my want was Sadhna. - Your girlfriend. ''No, no l mean the devotion towards art.'' That is why l decided that no matter.. ..how much l would have to struggle.. ..l will never ask my mother for help. l believe in goodness and truthfulness. That is very good thing. l like good and truthful people very much. Do you even like me then? Did you forgive him for the lies he told? You had that dance competition.. ..l don't know why he was so envy.

''Then l explained to him, that now go and say sorry to her.'' ''You said sorry to her, thank God you forgave him.'' You see l cannot withstand lies. You cheater! - He is joking. - Shut up! - He is joking. He is a very funny person. ''Niraali, there is a lot of space..'' ..on my bike you know that. Should l give you a lift? There is a lot of space can l also come? We all three will dance and you will take the girl alone. Vasuli . ''Stupid, here take ten rupees.'' lt is 'Nag Panchami' go and drink some milk. Was saying that l knew every corner of the house. ''Nothing, you all can do nothing at all.'' l will have to do everything. Go and do. Why are you crying like a girl? Show some anger ness. Are you a man or not? Gopal made such a big fun of you. And you kept quiet. Did your mother gave you education for this? She only gave me education. You did not let me give the exams. We had left you alone for giving the love exams. And your love story was about to be created. And he ruined everything. ''Who ruined it, that stupid?'' But in front of Niraali he even insulted you. At least l made a hole in Monty's car. ''What did you do? - Dance. - Dance, yuck.'' All you did was cut the wire. He took advantage of my good will. ''Listen cut hi, cut him. - Wire. - Are you an electrician?'' Cut Gopal. - l cannot cut anyone. - What? You cannot cut anyone. Did you forget what all he did with you? He snatched your room. And after coming here he even snatched your food. He even snatched your life. He even snatched your Niraali from you. - Correct. And do you remember that night. When you did not have a blanket to sleep with. Do you know where that blanket went? Who took it? You lost the blanket because of him. lf l would have been in you place. ''l would have bought a death cloth for him, a death cloth.'' Then come in my place. l don't even have money to buy poison. You are crying for such a small thing. ''Such a small thing, l am there, your friend.'' l will give you money for the poison. Really l am telling you the truth. Really. - Yes. - Then okay. ''Tea, tomorrow his morning tea will be his last tea.'' What are you doing? - Dance. Gopal. - Yes. - Gopu. - Say! Hot tea. - Give. - Drink it. - Go from here. Why are you staring at me like dogs? Have you seen my face for the first time? ''For the last time. - Why, are you committing suicide again?'' Gopu please don't do so much hard work. l cannot see it. You please down for some time. You flop actor. - What was the.. .. need to call me a flop actor? Whether l lie down or sit down.. ..what difference does it make to you. ''You are right, whether you lie down..'' ..or sit it does not make any difference to me. But finally you are going to become late. Late Gopal. - Madhav please don't trouble him. How are you feeling? l am feeling as if two mice's are making noise in my ears. He can hear noises. - What else is happening? Just once l propose to Niraali. Then l will start a family. ''You don't think about Niraali and the family, l am there.'' How are you feeling heath wise? ''Health wise, health wise some thing is happening to me.'' My right hand is itching. ''Right, first the left leg will itch, then..'' ..the right then the whole body from the head to the body. ''You do, don't you know what l do when my right hand itches?'' ''No, l beat everyone up.'' ''No Madhav my brother, don't hit him.'' He is alive only for a few moments now. Come here you fool. ''You hit, you hit if you want to die by hitting some one.'' You go on hitting. What are you doing? Why are you hitting so hard. What are you doing? This is the.. ..place where l wear my glasses. Why do you take everything so seriously? Laxman what did you do. lf he carries on hitting us like this. We will die before him. ''You stupid people, you are troubling me since morning.'' ''l asked for tea, there was only empty cup.'' There was no tea in it. What happened? Who is it? Seem like he drank the tea that was meant for Gopal. What happened? What is he saying. He is saying that the tea Laxman.. .. had made for you in that.. - l had.. ..brought ice specially for Gopal. And l had put spices in it and also red chilly powder. Are you making tea or a delicacy? Who? He will not die so easily. ''l know those fools, even the poison..'' ..must have been a fake. How will they save? Till when will they save themselves? What is it? Grandfather. What happened to your voice? l have a sore throat grandfather. ''Tel me one thing, what is the time? - 12:05.'' ''Oh, it is already 12 o' clock.'' ''After that 12:06, 12:07, 8, 9.'' How is this? - No grandfather l don't wear flowery garland. And l don't have that habit. ''This is not for you, it is for your grandmother.'' ''lt is valentine's day. - Yes, yes.'' How will this be? ls it nice? - Yes. ''Okay, okay.'' Nothing's gonna change my love for you. Nothing's gonna change my love for you. ls it okay? - From where did you.. ..get the thought of giving me a flowery garland? l knew that you would forget.

How am l looking? - You are looking very beautiful. We used to express on the auspicious day in our days. ''What can l do times have changed, modern times.'' On valentines day when the boy tells his girl l love you. Then even the girl does not refuse. She accepts it and also says l love you. What will Sameer say if he hears? What will he say? He will say that even my love should.. ..grow with life just like grandmother and grandfather. ''Tell me one thing, is Sameer really interested Niraali?'' You are.. ''No, she really a very nice girl Mangala.'' ''She is very nice, whosever house she goes.'' He will be very happy. ''That means l will have ton propose to Niraali tonight, Hi.'' ''They are mad, they are saying that..'' ..l should go and propose to the girl tonight. ''ls that possible? - No. - Shall we sleep. - Yes, come on.'' ''He is right, going to a girl's in the night.'' That will make a very bad impression. ''Bad idea, we should go and sleep.'' You go l will just finish my work. - Come on. Will we sleep together? - Come on. Come on today is valentines day. ''Golmaal'' ''Golmaal'' Niraali. - All of here at this time. What is all this? - Today is valentines day. And it is already 12 o' clock. - So? So we have brought a gift for you. You go. - Go. - Here.

You have brought a cheque. You want to buy Niraali. You are even worse than them. Does he even have an account? You have come to buy me. ''Get out l say get out. - Get out, get out, get out.'' What are all of you doing here? You also get out. Get out of here. God. Since when did you start flirting with the girl? And what is the use of flirting with her. Will you take him along for romancing her? l will not go. - l only said. You even started talking after seeing the girl. ''l wrote, that you did not know till today that l couldn't speak.'' That is why you misunderstood me. l am not like you all. - Okay. Mangala. - What happened? What happened to your voice? - l am Sameer. Didn't you have sore throat? - Now it is fine. lt is fine? l thought that my wife has sore throat. This old man is so boding! ''lf l give a raw mango to him, it will get converted into ripe mango.'' Get rid of him! Niraali is going to come. Grandpa. - Yes. Your walking stick. - Walking stick? Why? Don't you want to go out? - Out! No! Why are you sending me out? Somebody is coming? Who? Nobody! - l see! Niraali is going to come! He is blind and this is the state. lf he was able to see.. Then l would have seen who is coming. lt implies Niraali is going to come. ''Now dear, l won't go anywhere.'' Wow! Let Niraali come. ''Grandpa, Niraali is not going to come.'' l too used to get rid of my father like this. ''Father, go to temple. Go to the temple.'' Did you have a love marriage? ''Yes, dear. lt was the first love marriage of an independent lndia.'' First one. - What about grandma? Grandma too had a love marriage. Grandma too had a love marriage. ''No, you.. how did you enticed grandma?'' Entice.. is a wrong word. l mean to say how did you do that.. ..that expressing your love to grandma. ''Expressing love? That is an interesting story, dear.'' Will it take time? ''No, but you will have to hear it out.'' l used to go to the jungle in the morning. At 6:30. There were no bathrooms at that time. Fool! Not bathroom. l used to go for a walk. My destination was in the jungle. l see. Mangala in the jungle. Shut up! And follow me! Grandpa's love story is running too long. Even Kumar Gaurav's love story didn't run so long. Hey! How long will we have to walk? Hey! Walk quietly! Did l tell you to come in the flashback? ''Yes, grandpa. What happened next?'' ''Then a turn came in my life, dear.'' What are you doing? - Cow dung. She looks like the heroine of an art movie. But she is our lady. lt's just that she is looking young. Do you come here everyday? You too pass this way everyday. Why didn't you come yesterday? Yesterday was Monday. - Monday?

My flight will land at 1 .30 in the night. No need to come to the airport. l will come on my own. ''What happened? Gopal, what happened?'' Sameer is coming. - What! Sameer is coming! Sameer is coming! Sameer is coming! Everybody is saying the same thing! Did you see this! l had told you all! Someday we will get stuck because of him! l am leaving! l say that you all too pack your luggage and leave! How can we leave like this? We should find such a house too. Where there are two old people! Both are blind! And they don't have any relative! lt takes time to find such a house! You guys are worried about the house! This might become a police matter! l will not listen to anybody! l am leaving! Shut up! Let me think! We will find of some solution! Box! - Box! - Box! lt must contain something precious. Yes. Like how they show in the movies. ''Open the box. And it contains jewels, diamonds and gold!'' Are you planning to steal this? What? ''No, Gopal! No, Gopal!'' ''Gopal, what are you doing?'' ''Madhav, explain to him! No, Gopal!'' Have you guys gone mad! ''The family that gave you love, and shelter..'' ..you will rob that family! We are not robbing the family. We are taking the box! You understand what l am trying to say! l think you shouldn't steal! We are not stealing! We are checking! ''lf we found something, then we will..'' ..take the loan and then return it. ''Gopal, this is sin!'' ''Look, this door is also not opening! God too is saying no, Gopal!'' ''Listen to me! Gopal, no!'' l see! lt opens from that side! l still say that this is wrong! - This is right! ''lf it contains some treasure, then l will make a movie..'' ..and l will sign all of you! ''Buddy, first let me open it!'' ''Stop, dear. You will need the key to open it.'' We.. l was just looking at it. l will tell you what it contains. This is your compass box. You were 6 years old when had insisted on it. And look at this. Gun. For 'Diwali'. ''You used to run all over the house, shooting the gun.'' And this is your car. You used to roam the entire courtyard with this. You used to play with this the whole day. ''What is this, grandpa?'' Ashes. Whose? Sameer's ashes. My grandson was born in America. We were craving to meet him. ''But 2 years ago, in an accident we lost our eyesight.'' ''With great courage, l told my son..'' ..everything about our accident. He couldn't endure it. And he left to come here along with.. ..my daughter-in-law and grandson. He was driving to the airport in his car. He met with an accident on the way. Nobody survived. My son.. my daughter-in-law.. my grandson. Nobody. l couldn't tell Mangala this thing. Otherwise she would have died. Only l had to endure this shock. My commissioner friend made arrangements.. ..to send me to America. And there with my own hands.. ..l performed the final rites of my entire pedigree. When l returned from America.. ..Mangala started asking me.. ''..how is our grandson, how grown up is he, does he talk..'' ..and have you told him about me? What would l have told him? What could l have told her? l didn't have the courage to tell her the truth. Everyday l used to say that l will tell her today. l will tell her today. ''Then.. on the day l decided, God send you as Sameer.'' But l had realized that you are not one but two. ''And gradually l realized that you all are not 2, but 4.'' But l had no qualms with your lie. Because Mangala was very happy. She was very happy. But.. if you left now.. ..then God knows what she will go through. She will shatter completely. l am saying the truth. What is left to shatter down? You.. such a big betrayal! These.. whoever they are.. l am not angry with them. Because they are outsiders. But you! You.. didn't even let me.. ..perform the final rites of my children! l wanted to embrace Sameer.. if only for the last time. On my lap. You all.. who are you all.. who gave you the right.. ..the right to play with an old couple's emotions! You all have committed a grave sin! Such a grave sin for which there is no punishment in this world. l have planned all this. They are not responsible for all this. Only l am responsible. Consider it my mistake or immaturity that l came here. But a greater mistake is that.. ..the love and family that l searched for all my life.. ..when l found that in you both then.. ..l couldn't recognize that. And l hurt both of you. Whatever punishment you give.. l accept it. l love this old man. Uncle has helped me a lot. Give me the urn otherwise l will thrash you all so much.. ..that even the beggar will refuse to give you alms. Why do you want the urn? What happened? Give me one chance to atone for my sins. Trust us. Laxman. ''Grandpa, come. Come. Grandma, come.'' ''This way, grandma. Come, come.'' You did the right thing by sending uncle inside. What do you want? - The urn. This? - Yes. - Take it. ''Boss, these are the same 4 guys..'' ..who had thrashed me thrice. l have never seen him before. Did you get thrashed at the wrong place? ''No! l swear on you, Babali-.'' Babali? Who? - He is the one. lmagine! Gabbar Singh's name in 'Sholay' is Sweetie. Keep quiet! Fire! Don't fire! l heard everything. l swear on Sameer's ashes. l am with you guys in this fight. So you have changed the side! Fire! Forgot to get the bullets! Forgot to get the bullets! ''lf the bullets are at home, then will you play hockey with this?'' Thrash them! What are you staring at! Go up! Switch it on! ''Golmaal.'' ''1 , 2..'' ''Golmaal.'' ''Golmaal.'' Gopal! Hang on! Hang on! Why are we fighting? You are not interested in the ashes. Do you want the urn? Yes! - Why? ''Look, this matter is between us.'' ''Come, sir.''' ''Excuse me, sir. You cannot go from here.''' Diamonds! - Diamonds! - Diamonds! ''Hold this, boys!'' What have you done! ''He asked for it, so l gave him. - Fool!'' Madhav! l have been searching for you guys since a long time! l have been running after you! Why do you want to ruin my career? Nobody comes to my garage. My wife has refused to come back from her maternal house! ''Please, return my money! Please!'' l am really sorry. You know l had come in the scorching heat.. ..without any slippers to return your money. And you know what happened? - What? He robbed that money. Really? Return his money! When did l steal it! l have jut met! Don't act smart! Return the money! Who are you? The landlord! - Tell him. Look! He is Mr. Vasuli. And he is Mr. Babali! Babali! - Babali! We will tell him to tie us 'Rakhi'. ''Hey, Babali!'' Babali! Why are you laughing! ''Golmaal!'' ''Golmaal!'' ''Golmaal!'' Who is it! Gopal! Grandpa! ''Babali-, it doesn't come out! lt doesn't come out!'' ''Gopal, what happened?'' Sorry! Sorry! Blood! What a nice.. Don't touch it! - Okay! What happened? - He too.. ''lt's really deep, man! - What happened?'' ''Everything is all right now. Come, commissioner sir.'' Commissioner sir.. l know what their punishment should be. After seeing what they all have done.. ..all the four will live with us. - What! Yes. You all four will live as the Shravan of these blind parents. And Nadeem too. - What? You all will receive your reward within 15 days. Reward? For what? Reward because you all have nabbed a dangerous.. ..gangster and got the diamonds too. So you will surely get the 10/ of that. Great! - My money! They see rich people and they start begging. Get out! ''Greetings, grandpa. Greetings, grandma.'' You have come to take pickle in the hospital too. ''Grandpa, you too!'' ''Tell me, which naughty guy have..'' ..you chosen from these l am here. Where are you going? l don't mind. Lucky. Doctor! But he can't speak! l know that he can't speak. But l wanted such a husband.. who would listen only to me. And he himself should remain silent. Excuse me. Excuse me. Do you have a sister? ''Yes, l have. But she is 7 years old. Why?'' We will have to wait for a long time. We will have to wait for a long time. ''Golmaal!'' Action! ''ls something fishy!'' ''We are troublesome, baby. We are great!'' ''Be careful! Be careful!
