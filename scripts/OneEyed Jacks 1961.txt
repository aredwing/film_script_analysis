It was there n the mountains... when we get stuck up there, remember? - There are five years. - Exactly. Yeah, right, about five years. I think he was wondering why never showed up with horses. Yeah, I thought about it. You know, it was nine days away. I thought I had drunk too much and forgotten... or had not had time... No I do not forgot, Kid. But there was nothing I could do. When I arrived at the ranch there were no horses. And the Mexicans did not speak English and when understood, said... had old the horses few weeks earlier. I took our horse, I made it and went toward him. But when I arrived at the Canyon I saw men everywhere. I was hiding until dark. I came a close a I could, to where the horse could go. I was hidden n the canteen... I gave a little gold to silence the man from the bar. There was not much there, if I remember correctly. Enough to go through the border and come here. Here n Monterrey. I thought it best to stay out movement until... until all the scroll Mexico was forgotten. So far I am clean. Clean enough to have been elected sheriff. Knowing me the way a I was... could not blame him not to believe. But if you're looking for a time to avenge what I did... I will feel very therefore, Kid. But if you want, tell them how and where they want to fight. I will face it. You gotta go, Dad. No need to worry what happened to me. I was also hidden until it was dark. When I saw the captain and soldiers... They also failed to find me. Thereafter, they were only women, drinks e... game. Are you sure that was it, Kid? Well, you know me, Dad. If unsure of this... we were exchanging bullets with one another outside. It was difficult to accept at the time... but that was 5 years ago. A man can not be angry for five years. Can? - Know what to do? - No. Will stay for dinner. Hey, Dad, I... gotta go, was only passing through... came to say hello, but there are people waiting n the city. Let me worry with it. I do not know. Better think about it because... I'm still n business. I want you to know my family. - Right. - Great. Come on. Just a minute, Kid. Mary! I want you to know an old friend of mine. Mary! Hello You are waiting for my father? Yes. - Do not want to sit? - Yes, I do. It is a friend I want who knows. Glad you're here. Rio, I want you to know my whole family. My wife, Mary. - How are you? "Very pleased. I already know my stepdaughter? "Yes, we said hello. Luiza-This is my stepdaughter. Very pleased. I love her like my own daughter. - He will stay for dinner. - Great. - We are happy. - Do not want to bother. There is some discomfort. Whether you wash? Yes. Take his hat. Father Almighty... thank food we will receive. We offer our humble thanks... and ask for a blessing food we eat. Pity those who nothing, Jesus, amen. Never heard you pray before the rank, Dad. Do you know long? Dad and I have a long history. I was just a kid when... when Dad got me. I never heard talk to you. We were half looters. When he was on the other side, no? All right, Kid, you all know already walked outside the law. We were a good match, enjoyed ourselves. Everything was reason to laugh, Dad. They could have cut our heads or... could have ended n jail or something. He was lucky. "Only luck, huh? - Yes. Of course that was long ago. They were bank robbers, Mr. Rio? Yes, m'am. And your father here. But no more. Not anymore. Will stay n Monterrey long? Enough to fix my horse and do some things. And then where are you? I do not know, Mrs. Longworth. I thought about going to Oregon. There is plenty of land there, I would like to take a look. Will be here for our party? When? Tomorrow till night. And you can not buy horseshoes for horse... because everything is closed. I mean barber shop, saddlery, bank... everything? The bank, everything is closed. So why not stay here? He heard the young man. He goes to Oregon. You know, I can postpone by one or two days. Do not expect much, Kid. It's just a street dance. Should be sufficient to entertain a man. So you stay? Well, from a young so adorable... I do not know if I can decline the invitation. Yes, I'll stay. ... And it's really true. Do not know about you, kid... but it was a great day for me.

But no, Kid, you ignored my warning... and went straight back Man, did he? Well.. not want that kind here... I will teach him a lesson will never forget. Let's see what kind of thing you're done. And this is a good start. Look what is happening with Romeo. - Must have done something. - Made something? Nothing so serious. When he gave that shot started a war.

All finished! Go home! It's raw! Yes, sorry therefore, River We saw everything and there was nothing we could do. It's okay, Bob. I've been everywhere trying hide the delegate. You know me, River If there was anything that could I do have wheezing. I said okay, Bob. It's called Devil's Point. Get there. And then? Let's just wait. Just wait. I hope you can, River Wow, they really did. It seems that everything is broken. I do not think will be fine for a long time. No need to be fawning around me, Bob. This is not, I'm just Rio thinking of you, that's all. Well, come on. We need some rooms. My friend is sick. We need a place to stay. - How many bedrooms? - Four. What is this? Fish? Something dead. Hey, where can we find drink around here? There. Hello, Miss. Luiza. Wait a minute. You know, I heard about your friend. That guy, what is even his name? Rio. I thought I could be interested. - Yeah, what about him? He was hanged, e... tortured n the center with lashes on the back. And how do you know? Someone has to the whistle. Four weeks. I think the honey over, boy. Will not improve more than that. Never mind. Let's go back to Morrel. Lying n the sun. Forget this Longworth. He's not worth it. What you say, pal? You must be crazy. Here is a fish. Take this fish stinky here. I am full of fish, Howard. And these waves crashing all day. Six weeks and was just vomiting I heard it from him. And it will not improve anything. How is hand, Rio? It going. Well, I was thinking if we stay here. What's the plan? I was thinking about everything that waiting on the bench. What is the plan, Bob? I'll tell you what we do. Let's hope that sheriff outside his home... and then assail that bank. I'm still hurt, Bob. Take! Well, we may have to change because their style... seems a little slow for me. I'm getting tired listening to this bullshit. We rode 1500 km, because you were considered the best. But how Things are going... I think from without you. Would have to go with six, instead of me. Me, may be only two of us. Oh, Bob. Do not want to get up, baby? It is eight o'clock n the morning. Come on, get up. So many things to do and I'm here. Luiza! Luiza Why did not you answer? Yes, mother. I'll have a child. - Hello. - Hello. - How are you? - I'm fine. Are you okay now? Yes, I'm fine. Want to sit? How did you find me here? - Loan told me. - Loan? Do not know how he knows. Well.. No matter. I'll leave here soon. Where you going? Have not thought about until end Longworth. End what? I'll kill him. Will kill him? Right. But why? Just because you hit? Yes, so and other things. I know it was something horrible what he did. And I was embarrassed for him. But that is no reason to kill a man. Reason? I have reasons. I have a thousand reasons. How many days spent n that jail n Sonor. How many nights spent digging holes for the swollen feet. With mice around me. I let five years pass. Heard men shouting and praying. Catching up dying. I do not understand. No? It is difficult to understand. 5 years ago on a hill were caught by soldiers. And he left for get new animals. But did not. It was the best friend I had. Abandoned me. And you know why? For two bags of gold. Are you sure he did that? Yes. Well, that's my sad history. But when it's over... I hope you come with me. After murdering him? That 'is not murder. That 's reckoning, that any man would. And you think to kill him will make it man. I do not know, but... just know that I think of that over five years. And that was the only thing that made me stay alive. River.. There are not many chances to be happy. And I think we have one now. Could not try forget it? Forget? Not while I'm alive. Rio Rio! Please, please try to forget it. Please take me with you. We can be very happy. Can not forget? - Can not forget... I can not, can not! Do not understand it can. I'd rather die than forget. So... I'm going away. I would not be here, when they bury you. I love you. Goodbye. Wait a minute. You should have some reason to come here. Yes, had. But it does not matter now. - This is my best bet. Very well. Want to get rich with my blood, Bob. The New York Yankee takes this. Well, thanks for the donations. How about a little your money? Romeo? While you're here good things to do. Was changed after he spoke with his little bird on the beach. That 's right, Bob. Get up, you pig! Get up! I want to get up I can break you. Come on, get up. Come on! You have reached the limit. If you speak one more time on it... kill you. I'd better forget the bank tomorrow, eh? Yes. What will you do now? I'm going behind her n the morning. What about Longworth? Just pray to God not cross him. Come with us, Modesto? I do not know. Go back to Mexico? Maybe. What do you think, Howard? Well, we have nothing else to do. What about your friend? Still determined to go after this woman? Yes, I think so. I do not know. "I'll say goodbye before you go. Very well. Boy. We are starting now. Just came to say goodbye. Has a long way ahead. Right. - Think of me once n a while. You bet. I will miss him. Listen... If you are tired of here go to Morrel. It's a small place... There is almost nothing there, but... - One can live quietly. - I will, boy. "Well, goodbye friend. "Goodbye, kid. Take care of yourself. Hey, where do they go? The way this is. This way. This is the way to Monterrey. Right. Let's rob the bank right now. That is, only two of you? I'm thinking it'll be three. - Are you n or out? - I do not. That 's not good. We will create many problems to Rio, you know? If we wait... Who knows. We've waited long enough for Rio I will not wait no more endure one more fool. Because he is no longer the boss, I am. Now... - Come with us or not? - I do not. Not you. Will try to stop me? Yes, I will try to stop him. However, Modesto, I am disappointed n you... acting this way. Will take time to Rio I'll tell you one thing. One more word, and I cut you n half. One more word, huh? Let me see. Maybe I can think of any. Yes, I have one. V-E-R-M-E! Worm! Try again. I am very disappointed with him. You're not? Of course I am. Perhaps it is this that 're looking for. Swallow them... worm. Damn! You had a good life. Come on. "Wait here. Be right back. - Right.
