How is he? Just a bit dazed. He'll be all right. He's not too bad. How do you feel? You want to charge more rent. Mrs. Hammond, when I first got here I thought I'd fallen easy. I don't want a list of my shortcomings. I'm trying to show you where you're hurting yourself. Can I talk to you as a person? If you listen, I could really put you right. Don't try and work me into a fit. I asked you before to leave me alone. I can't stand it. How do you feel, Frank? You won't be able to shoot your mouth off like before, at least not for a few days. Can you fix me up with a dentist? I don't know. It's Christmas, you know. I want it tonight. Well, I could try. Tonight! Come on, you lot, out! How do I look? I've seen worse. Go on, you're dry. Going to Weaver's party tonight? I've been counting on it. I'd leave well alone if I were you. Weaver and parties. I'd get your mouth seen to first, it's more important. How's your Mrs. Hammond? She's all right. I've bought some presents for the kids. The bitch won't like it, though. She doesn't like me interfering. Hallo, Frank. How are you, lad? Not now, Johnson, we're in a hurry. Mr. Weaver. - Yes, George? - Frank's ready. Oh, good. How's it going, Frank? All right. Hallo, Maurice. Are you coming in the car, too? I wouldn't miss it. We might even get a camera. Put your doggie in the boot, George. Right-oh, Mr. Weaver. What about your dog, Frank? Go on in, Dad. That's not very funny. Let's have a look. It's not me, it's Frank here. Right. Come on. I have a Members Ticket but haven't seen a match this season. Sit yourself down It's a mess. They'll have to come out. Six of them. It's all I can do. Hasn't Weaver arranged to pay you? That's not the point. He'll need a plate. What of it? I can't make it, this is the Children's Department. I know a couple of kids who have false teeth. Do you? You do the pulling and get your mate to do the plate. It's no party here, let's get on with it. You see, he's in pain. It'll be ten guineas. - Ten guineas! - Take it or leave it. Come on, whatever the bloody price. It'll have to be gas. Have you eaten recently? No, not since my dinner. Would you mind waiting outside? Go on, Maurice. Right. Put your hands in your pockets. That's it. Sit tight. You'll feel nothing. Breathe deeply. Sit tight. Keep your hands in your pockets. You'll feel nothing. I've been thinking. Why don't we go for a walk? What on earth for? What do you want us to go walking in the bloody dark for? I like to talk to someone when I'm walking. Your problems, they're sort of... You've plenty of friends. There, look at this funny man. Here, you play with it. You must be mad to think I'd go out walking with you. I don't want you poking your nose in my affairs. You won't find me poking my nose into yours. I have some pride left, if you didn't know. Don't you want to be happy? If I'm left alone, I'm happy. I don't need you pushing in. I'm not pushing in. I'm just trying to be friendly. I'm not going about with a grin on my face to make you think I'm happy. I don't mean laughing all the time. You just don't look happy. - It's not a question of laughing. - You make me sick! I am sick. I'm bloody sick of living here, an' all. Mr. Machin, that's easily settled. Don't! Stop living here. We'll be better off without you. Come on, open up! What have you got in there? Open up, you boss-eyed git. Open up. The Manager's expecting us. Come on, Jeff. Come on, open up! Come on. Excuse me. Excuse me. I'm with players. I'm with players. I didn't know it was you. Come in. And now, the biggest moment of the evening. The winners of the Freestyle Dance Contest, Miss Evie Turner and Mr. John Whittaker. We've just been joined by another winning team we are proud of. Our City Rugby League Team! Come on, the City! I'm going to ask a couple of these famous men present the winners with their prizes. Len Miller and Maurice Braithwaite. Come on, come on. Just wait till I've finished. Come on, Len. Ladies and Gentlemen, Len Miller, Captain of the City, and Maurice. How do. Now, ladies and gentlemen, it's on with the dance. General Excuse Me, and may the best man win. Excuse me. Not this one. He called a general Excuse Me. Do you want a thumping, love? Aye. Come outside and Excuse Me there. Hold on a minute. Hold on! You... What's it all about? You bastard! I was meaning to ask. What's that? Your name is Johnson. Aye, that's right. You're a scout for the City. You could say so. Get me a trial. Now, wait, wait a minute, lad. Come see me play. I need some cheering. You can cheer yourself. I won't freeze up there for an hour. - A lot depends on it. - You don't have to. It's a job. If they sign me, I might get 300-400 quid. I'm sure they will. That's the encouragement I need. Come, I'd like you to come. If I wanted to go, I would. I don't want to. Wish us luck, then. All that's coming your way. I don't wish for my luck. I'll have to make do with my own. That's it, Frank! Well done, lad! What's his name, Wade? Machin. Frank Machin. Charles is here. Hallo, Charles. - Charles. - Gerald. Pass the ball, Gower. Pass the bloody ball, you nit! Pass the ball, you git. Go on, Gower. Get after it! Let's have that bloody ball, you nut! Get stuffed! Get rid of that bloody ball! - Come on, Gower! - Pass the ball, man! Bloody hell! What are you playing at, bloody frog? Trainer, trainer. What's your name? I didn't do it. - I never touched him. - Tell that to League Chairman. I swear, I never touched him. Look, there's no blood on them. Go on, get off! Take some beating, bloody idiot! He's not fit for a football field. Aye. They got the wrong man. You think so, Mr. Slomer? It's as plain as the nose on your face. That's not football. It's a rough game. I like to see men play as if they meant it. - You played a blinder, Frank. - You enjoyed it? They'll be all over you. I was right in't middle of Committee. Don't get excited. I'll buy you a drink. What are you having? I'll have a beer. Two beers, please. Two beers, sir. You won't find them different. Naturally, they won't show it like me. Allow me. What? No, allow me. I really insist. A double, Bob. You played a good game today. Aye, he played a blinder. Don't worry, he's a bit soft. How'd you like the City? I'm getting the hang of it. I rather gathered that. Pity about Gower. What? They took him to hospital. I believe it was a broken nose. Their hooker packs quite a punch. Bad luck. Yes, it is. You haven't signed on yet? They haven't made up their minds yet. I think they won't find that difficult. Do you? Goodbye, Frank. Who was it? You know, Frank. Who was it, Dad? Guess. Go on, have a guess. Who was it? That's mean. That's mean. Who was it, dad? That's mean. Why did you squeeze my wrist? Don't know. Why? Was it Weaver? You hurt me, you know. Just because it's Weaver. You get far too excited, lad. I thought you knew it was. I was surprised, him talking to me. Must have been impressed. You think there's something? Aye. Want me to come home with you? It's no trouble to me. Aye. Come, have some tea. Mrs. Hammond won't mind. A coincidence, know her husband. Yep. Not well. Maybe a year afore he died. Them not his boots, are they? What she keep 'em for? I don't know. How long you lived here? About five or six months. She had kids, didn't she? Aye. How does she manage? She does all right, she does all right. She just put up the shutters and stopped living. My wife left me 10 years ago. Can I have orange juice, Mum? And me. Isn't it warm, Mum? Warm! We can't use all that coal. I'll fetch you a load from pit. Mr. Johnson, Mrs. Hammond. Lan and Lynda. We haven't much for tea. Don't boast. He might think we're poor. Sit down. Hi, young un. You're getting very heavy. I know. Tell me, what have you been doing? Been shopping with mam. Have you! And where else? To see our dad. How'd the match go? Did you win? He played a blinder, Missus. Did he? They signed him on? It's not as quick as that. But he can ask anything he likes. Isn't that right? Isn't that right? I don't know. It won't pay them to turn you down. They'll give him it, Mr. Johnson. Aye, he'll sail away. He'll sail away. He'll be very pleased. I'll see you, Dad. You mind me helping you, Frank? Why do you say that? I'm in a position to help. It's only right. Aye, I think it's right. You don't mind? No. Don't know what you're talking about. That's all right, then. I'll see you. You know, any time at all. See you, Dad. You play for nothing? Amateur pay, thirty bob. That's hardly a wage. They pay good when the sign you on. The old man treats you like a son. I call him Dad because he's old. I don't mean that. What then? The way he treats you. He ogles you, looks at you like a girl. Don't come with that. - He's interested, that's all. - I'd say excited. What are you getting on about? He hasn't much to get excited about. He's done a lot for me. He's never had a job. How do you know? I've got eyes. Just look at his hands. He's got awful, soft hands. What's hands got to do with it? He's got awful hands, I got awful hands. We're not all women. It's nothing to do. You husband, I gather he worked at Weavers Engineering. Who told you? Johnson said he used to know him. He told you something else. No. I expect he thought it's very chivalrous of you, helping a widow, and all that. It's nothing to you what people think? It isn't. It's bringing Eric's name into it I don't like. When Eric died all my world went out. He'd say he didn't know why he was living. He used to say: "How was I ever made alive?" When he went, I felt I hadn't been proper to him. I hadn't made him feel he belonged. I shouldn't be telling you this. I, I don't mind. No. You being what you are. Self-reliant. All that cockiness. You don't seem worried like Eric was. I mentioned it because I saw you polishing the boots. Is there anything the matter? No. Like I said, I don't mind. 1.000 pounds. A thousand. 1.000. That's a lot for a player just entering. I want 1.000 down. Look here, Frank, it's not a comprehensive insurance policy. Mr. Riley's offer is fair. I want a thousand pounds down. We're not trying to put anything over on you. Get that into your head. But we represent other people. We're responsible for investing their money. I can't change my mind. I feel I'm worth it. What's Mr. Slomer think? I'm surprised you discussing such a figure at all. What figure would you suggest? I'm far from convinced he's the kind of player we want. You realise, as I'm sure Frank does, that we're not the only club interested. Forget other clubs. We're here to decide whether we want him. You have my opinion. Wait outside a minute. How goes it, Frank? They fixed you up? They're talking. A drink? Whiskey? Whiskey, Bob. Phillips from the City Guardian. You needn't take it seriously. Why not? It's only a game, old sport, for Weaver's benefit. They act like that for Weaver? It's his or Slomer's cash they're dishing out. If Slomer hates you, Weaver'll buy you out of spite. You got a bruise coming. Aye. Weaver wouldn't have you up to say ta-ta. Frank. What will you do if we don't sign up? Don't know. Carry on as I am. Change your mind about splitting payment? No. No, 1.000 down. There's nothing else for it. You're not going to sign me? That's it, we'll have to. Congratulations, Frank. Congratulations, Frank. Hold it. Aren't you going to read it? Aye. Don't spend it all at once now. What does it feel like now? I don't feel much. It's all a bit quick. That's my fault. I like to get things settled. I suppose you don't mind. Not now, I don't. Did you have other offers? No, at least I didn't hear anything. If you do, you'll know what to say. Property of the City. Best to make sure. Fairfax Street. That rings a bell. Hammond used to live there. He got killed at your place. Weaver's. I've got digs with his widow. Hammond. It was Eric Hammond, wasn't it? Yeah. I remember the funeral. How'd he get killed? Quite nasty. He worked with a lathe. Very careless. He was using a hand-file. It shot off and stuck through him. We thought he'd done it on purpose. On purpose! Yes. Funny way to commit suicide. She got no compensation. The case went against her. We gave her a bit, not much. End of the street, or front door? End of the street will do. Right. Good night, Frank. Good night, Mr. Weaver. Frank! Aye, Frank! Hi, Dad. What are you doing here? Have they signed you on? They wouldn't have me, Dad. You ought to see 'em round that Weaver like a pack of dogs around a bitch. I told them what to do with their bastard money. You haven't done that? Aye. You're not crying, are you? You're not crying? So it was all for nothing. Hey, Dad. I was only kidding you. I was only kidding. How much do you think it is? You tell me, Frank. You tell me. A 1.000 quid. Nay! Aye. You want to see the check? Could I see it? You and me, Frank. That's us. How much do you want? Oh, no, Frank. What, "oh, no, Frank"? Oh, no, Frank. Now, Dad, listen. I don't enjoy getting kicked about for other people's enjoyment. Only if I've been paid a lot for it. Share some of this. No, Frank, I don't want any. All right, I'll send you some of it. No, wait, Frank, I didn't do it for the money. That Johnson called early on. That friend of yours. I just saw him. He has been waiting? It was hours ago. He likes to get out a bit. Get friends your own age. I have. They've signed me on. Didn't hear what I said. Yes. You'll be pleased. Guess how much it is. I don't know anything about it. Go on, have a guess. Guess how much you think I'm worth. Three pence? Now, careful, careful, you've made a joke. Cracking jokes like that you could get injured. Have a guess. Come on. No! I'd better tell you. One thousand pounds. You're a great ape! You don't believe me? Look, I've got a cheque here. 1.000 in letters and numbers, delivered to Frank Machin. They brought me home in a Bentley. It's very good. You're not very excited. It's more than I got when my husband died. That's right bloody handsome of you. You've done nothing for it. I didn't have to get killed for it. Some have life made for them. And some make it for themselves. It's about time you took that off your shoulders. And don't wake me in the morning, I might be dead. That money. You'll be leaving now? No. I don't think so. He'll be all right when he gets fresh air. Get him into bed. I'll be myself tomorrow. What's the matter, Frank? She's... she's so small. He's just full of gas, that's all. She's so bloody small. A little bit in, Frank. She gives me nothing. She gives me bloody nothing. If I was a marrying kind, but thank the Lord I'm not, I would wed a rugby fullback. I'll find dodge, we'll both find dodge together. Frank. If we are in the middle of the night... Right. The patient's awake. We've heard all your what-nots. Haven't we, Mr. Weaver? My carrier. What's he want? My carrier. My carrier! Steady, lad, steady. He had a carrier? A carrier. Is this it? What's in there? Presents. What? Presents! Come on. What do you think of it? You bought it? Aye. It's a bit of all right. You leaving that there? Why not? You won't smile when you come for a drive. He can take you out on Sunday afternoons. I'll never go in that thing. It's like riding in your front room. Let's go for a drive. Don't mind your mother. Watch your head. I want him for his dinner and get back to school. I'll take him in this. We won't be long. Frank, lad, we're there. Go on, give them a smile, Frank. Smile for them, Frankie. Can I take you home? I'm all right, Dad. You've come, Frank. You all right, darling. Where is the bathroom? Up them stairs, there. Frank, it's me, Maurice. I know you're in there, daft frog. What, you sulking? Frank, come on out, will you! Where are we going? I thought we'd make a day of it. For a run in the country. You don't mind, do you? We can't get out now, can we? We could stop the car and turn back. If only for the children's sake, it's worth it. Come on, lan. That's a good boy. There's a good lad. Come on. Come to the next one. Come on, lan, you throw next. Let's play soccer, Lynda. I got it. Kick us a goal, lad. Come on, kick us a goal. Come on. Margaret, catch it! I'm no good at catching. Come on, Lynda. Come on. Catch it. Frank! Catch it! See, it's easy. Throw us a catch. Look who can't catch. Come on, lan. Come on, lan. Catch this. Ready? Way up in the sky. Frank, take me with you. Lynda! Lynda! Lynda! Lynda, stop waving, he'll fall into the water. Give over! Be careful. Lynda. Be careful, love. You'll kick it over. What did you want to do that for? I wanted to cool off. One, two, three... Mam, did you see us? Yes. Are you wet? Come on, lan. I'll change my shoes. Go on, get it! Machin! Isn't that Frank Machin? Yes, it is, love. Fond of kids, isn't he. Not quite how I pictured him. Ready, Frank? One moment. You seen Cleopatra? She looks all right. Like to meet him? Yes, ask him over. Frank. Come here a moment. The Emperor calls. Go steady, you bloody nit. Well done, Frank. How are you feeling? Champion. Good. Meet my wife, Frank. How do you do? You're one of the stalwarts of the City, according to him. That's a relief. He doesn't seem to be very sociable. He's shy. I asked him to introduce us before, but he's slow. I like meeting his protgs now and then. He sometimes keeps them to himself. All his stars. We don't have stars in this game. That's soccer. What do you have? People like me. I've got a thirst. I'll be off. Nice to meet you. Goodbye, Machin. Goodbye, Frank. You played a great game. Keep it up, lad. Ah, Machin. You did very well today. Thank you. Very good try. Very good indeed. Keep it up. Thank you, Mr. Slomer. Watch the door. Hallo, Frank. Hallo, Dad. Walking back to happiness. Oh, yeah, yeah. Walk right on to loneliness. Oh, yeah, yeah. I never knew that I'd miss you. What you wear when it's hot? Where's your husband, fishing? He left his bloody bait at home. One mistake you wished for me. Hey, love, show us your personality. Maurice, how's that tart of yours? Who? Judith? Aye. She come across with the old one two? Careful whose bloody coat tail you're pulling. You know I love you, don't you? I'm not your flag to wave up and down. You need stuffing, Maurice, you know? Women! Bloody women! Walking back to happiness. Walking back to happiness. Walking back to happiness again. Here she comes. And her mother. Hallo. Hallo, love. This is the tart I told you about. Just listen to him. I'll come back later. You should have come in sooner. How do, Judith? He's told you my name? That and... other things. Watch it, Tarzan. This is Pam. Hallo. How do you do? - Hallo, Pam. - Hallo. I saw your try this afternoon. I got a good pass. Ain't he modest! - A drink? - Gin and orange. Gin and orange. - Judith? - Gin and tonic. Gin and tonic. Matey, a little service, please. Come on. Ladies and gentlemen, any volunteers who can dance, sing, show muscles, do a striptease, fan dance or bubble dance? Come on, Maurice. Come on, Maurice. We have our City heroes here tonight. Including our old friend, Frank Machin. Come on, Frank. All right, Frank? Right. Right. Here, in my heart, I'm alone and so lonely. Here, in my heart, I just yearn for you only. Here in my arms I long to hold you. Hold you so near, ever close to my heart. So, darling, say that you care. Take my love I give gladly. Surely you know I need your love so badly here in my heart. My love and my own dear here in my arms and stay here in my heart. Get the door open. There's not a bloody war on. I'm sorry I'm late. It's all right. That's all right then? You been drinking. Not asking how we got on? You play football until this time. I've been out with the lads, you know, living. You must have had a hard time. Matter of fact, we did. You're drunk. You've come here drunk. That's no bloody crime. You're not me mother, me something or other. What are you getting on about? I tell you, I'd like it a lot if you'd let me call you Sunshine, Margaret. Sunshine. Sunshine. Don't get it all over your clothes! Lynda! Yes, Mam? Where are you? In the kitchen. All right. I just wondered where you were. I didn't know you were in. I was going to make the bed. I'm off to work in half an hour. I didn't hear you. I never know where I am with the children on holiday. No, Frank, no! It's all right. No! It's all right. Frank, no! Frank! Mam! You going to say anything? You made a muck-up with that loose forward. Won't play again for 6 months. Watch you don't get suspended. What else can I do? This big character comes along at every scrum. I just stand in his way. Stand in his way! I put my shoulder under his jaw, he goes down. He did. I counted the times he came round. 14. I must have hit every part of his face. You should have seen Bradshaw. And the 15th, they called him off flat out. He bloody were! You could hear the crack all over. It proves I'm a good defensive player. Hello, Charles. - How's it going? - Champion, Mr. Slomer. Giving trade secrets away? Have you changed your mind about Frank? Steady, John. When Weaver signed him, I thought it was a mistake. But I must admit he gave me as much pleasure on that field as anyone today. But nothing like the old days - Hi, Ed. - Hallo. My photographs are getting smaller lately. See to it. Now, then, Tiger. Put a smile on my face when I'm scoring. Hi, Maurice. What's up? Just waiting for Judith. Two, Jack. I take my pleasures quietly. When I see them gather round, I shoot them a line. Here, I brought your mail down. Half a dozen. One a week's my record. Why don't you bring Margaret down here sometime? She won't come. Bloody school kids! Why not? She's a home bird. You taking the jam out of somebody's sandwich? Me! No, I told you, she's a home bird. Now shut up. That tiger can snap your hand off. I can take care of him. Watch it. Maurice. Maurice. Read that. Come on. "Dear Frank. Enjoyed watching you play. Rare times I watch the game. Forgive me. Drop by for a drink sometime. Wednesday afternoon might be suitable. Best wishes. Ann Weaver." Ann Weaver? You're not going? Read the P.S. "Without your rowdy team mates." Is that a joke? You're not taking it seriously? - Why not? I've got nothing to lose. - I wouldn't be so sure. She thinks I'm good-looking, that's all. - Give us a kiss, will you? - Don't come with that. Careful, Tarzan. Come on, I want some husband left, you know. What do you mean husband? Hasn't he told you? We got engaged. Shut up! Engaged? No wonder he's been so rough. The Lord help you. Give us a kiss. Congratulations. When will the bells start? We're planning on Easter. You'll be laughing when it happens to you. I'll put up a bigger fight than that. They're never satisfied. Women! They don't frighten me. They don't frighten me. Happy Christmas. Happy Christmas. We're having a party on Christmas Eve. You'll be coming? We've got a match Christmas Eve. I could come afterwards. See you do. Playing professional football you don't need a job. Unless you're interested in money. Are you, Frank? I put it to good use. Like what, for example? Helping people out, things like that. Buying such a big car? You've been very successful. It's like this, Mrs. Weaver. You see something and you go get it. It's that simple. Sounds very simple. You like gardens? No. Oh, Frank. Have another drink. Help yourself. Not playing football this afternoon? No. I like you. You're like a big cat. Always moving. I've never seen anyone so restless. Come sit down. I'm not sure I should be here. Frank, don't take that silly attitude. Come sit down. Nothing's upset you, has it? No, nothing. No need to feel awkward. I don't know. Don't talk. I ought to go. Why? You were behaving so nicely. It's not fair. Oh, fair! You're not feeling out of your depth? I might be. There's no need, you can see. It's not Mrs. Hammond? Mrs. Hammond? The woman you live with. I lodge there. Well, whatever. Is it her? I've been thinking about Mr. Weaver. I see. I think I'll go. Say it, say it, say it, say it. Say it! Why don't you say it? Say what? Say you've some feeling for me. Frank, I can't. Not yet. You know me, and how I've been to you. I can't let my feelings go. Not again. To have them cut off like Eric and everything gone in one person, and dead. Give me time, Frank. We may not be able to enjoy it by that time. I don't know. You might just want to hear me say it. Feel that's all you wanted and go away. You keep fighting me. I can't be that bad. When will you give us some peace? I come upstairs, don't I. You make me feel I'm buying it, and I'm no. That's how I am. I've nothing more to give you. You don't mean that. Don't tell me how I should feel. If only you'd leave me alone. You're so big, so stupid. You don't give me a chance. Oh, my God! Maurice! Maurice! Well, Machin, what do you want? Hallo, Frank Come in, we won't eat you. Will you offer a drink to this wild young man? Whiskey will do. Mrs. Weaver. They're making a lot of noise. Last time I open my house. Everyone in town's here. You've been in the wars this week. I'll be all right. I'll be all right. He'll learn he has to pay something for his ambition. I think it spoils his looks. Does it hurt, Machin? No. I don't feel anything. Take no notice of them. Slomer's your newest fan. You have the charm that appeals to him. I'm not the only one who's found interest in Frank. What do you mean? At a time even you were impressed by him. I carried that boy. It was on my back, nobody else's. You've carried me, or something? Yes. From the beginning. I've played myself into the corny team. You don't appreciate the help you've had. Look, am I a good footballer or am I not? The only reason you're in is because Slomer wants you there. Come now, Anne. Frank's had enough for one day. Well, I see by my onion it's 11:30. Time to be going. I like to see in Christmas at home. Don't bother to come down. He'll see that I don't get into trouble. Merry Christmas. Tell me, Frank, have you been indulging in Mrs. Weaver's weakness for social informalities? Is that your business? You decide. No. You have a good season, Frank. Until today. Huh? Until today. I see what you mean. False teeth can be better looking sometimes. What do you think mine are? They look neat. Real or false? False, but could be real. False. You're in a tricky position with Weaver. He hasn't liked me for a bit. He thought he owned you. He doesn't like it taken away. Still you'll be all right while I'm there. You understand what I mean? Aye. Right. Well, Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. You're Frank Machin, aren't you? You look different on the field. Like a tiger. You're pale. Aren't you well? Am I a good footballer? Let's go upstairs and find an empty room. Oh, he's a jolly good fellow. For he's a jolly good fellow. For he's a jolly good fellow, and so say all of us. For he's a jolly good fellow, and so say all of us. For he's a jolly good fellow. For he's a jolly good fellow. For he's a jolly good fellow, and so say all of us. And so say all of us, and so say all of us. For he's a jolly good fellow. For he's a jolly good fellow. For he's a jolly good fellow, and so say all of us. Hip, hip! Horray! Hip, hip! Horray! Weaver, you're a fifth rate gutless quack! It's late. You just got back? Are you all right? Aye. Aye. You've had a visitor. Two. Nobody you know. Who could that be? Don't get so hoity. You don't know everybody in my life. Eric's sister and her husband. I didn't know she had one. Here. What do you think of that? What is it? Is that you? Before I met Eric. When was that? At the end of the war. We worked in a factory making bombs. You should have seen us. All women. We had some times. You weren't married? No. I had some chaps, though. We had good fun together. Aye, I bet you gave them a right run around. Tell no stories, tell no lies. God, what have you done? I don't look too good, do I? I've aged 10 years. You reckon? What have you been doing? You been fighting? I got them broken. The dentist pulled out the bits. Six bits, ten guineas. I'm in the wrong business. Spoilt your looks. So I've been told. By a girl? Who else worries about me? You went to Weaver's then? Aye. You look ill, Frank. You oughtn't to have been out. What am I going to do with the presents for the kids? Go on, go on, go on. I'll put them in their stockings. And I've got yours here. You shouldn't have bothered. Want it now? What is it? Take it. No, leave it till the morning. Don't spoil it. Will you put the light out? I'd never guessed you made bombs. Meg, come to bed with me. It'll be cold and I need looking after. Mother always goes to be with Santa. All right. But just for Christmas. All right, five quid. Watch it. Steady now. Five quid? It's only money. You've got him worried, Maurice. Of course, he's a family man. But whose bloody family? Stuff it or I'll belt you across that back seat! I've got Frank in a corner. All right, Maurice. Let's see what you're made of. There's 10 quid. Stop, I'm getting off here. You're a friend of mine? I've give you all the money, haven't I? I'll see you for ten quid. What you got? Nothing much. Two pairs of kings. I'd have bet the whole bus. I'm not greedy, Maurice. 30 quid's enough. She'll murder me. Who, Judy? She bloody will. It went to charity. Lucky bleeder! Is that what you call it? It bloody is. Ken, you want a hand? I might as well. You know what you're doing with the cash? I can take care of it. But can it take care of thee? Get stuffed, love. Margaret. I'm coming. I've got something to show you. We won't be back too late, Mrs. Farrer. Why don't you pop out and get yourself something? It's all right, Mr. Machin. I'll leave it here. Here she is. You like it? It's beautiful, love. Thanks. Wait a minute. What? Wait a minute. Let's put this on, for a change. Oh, no, Frank. It's yours. It's here, it's nobody else's. Don't be silly, Frank, I... I want you to have it. Look, it won't bite. Frank, I can't. I can't wear it. Come on. Come on. Just for tonight. Just for tonight. That's a start. We won't be back late. All right. Bye for now. Ta ta. Goodbye. This table is reserved, sir. You're right, it's reserved. For us. Sir, there is a nice table... Why don't you get lost, love? We could have. He's doing his job. His what? You call that a job? Traipsing about like a 50-year old tart? Good evening, madam. Good evening, Mrs. Weaver. Mr. Weaver. Nice to see you again. - Tom, keeping well? - Well, thank you, and you? Will you be going in, or order at the bar? Yes, we'll have a drink first. - Good evening, madam. - Hello, Bruce. Good evening. And to follow? Bird? Duckling's nice this evening. Or meat? A nice steak? Have you any roast meat? Roast beef, madam. Yes, and some vegetables. Cauliflower and roast potatoes? Thank you, madam. And you, sir? Let's have a look. I'll have a steak, blood rare, some cabbage and some potatoes. No soup, sir? Aye, I'll have soup, and plenty of it. Thank you, sir. And to drink? - Yes, we'll have... - I'll send the Wine Waiter over. What did you ask me for? He'll bring fried egg and bacon. Don't burn his whiskers. You shouldn't behave like that. We're paying, that's what interests them. No, it's not. If you act like a pig... If I'm a pig, what's this load of fat bastards? I've told you. Enjoy yourself, that's what this is for. I can handle these people. Hi, love. Have they burnt your custard? Really! These old ladies are a bit past it. He didn't know what to say. - You care to order? - Thank you. Mrs. Weaver. Your table is already reserved. Thank you, Thomas. Isn't that Frank Machin? She's not getting what she expected. Does anybody with Machin? Give us the bill, love, we're leaving. Yes, sir. The fur coat, please. I feel almost sorry for her. Anything wrong, sir? I don't mind paying, but has he added right? He's no good at his sums. No mistake, sir. Are you sure? Quite, sir. Good, I just wanted to make certain. For your trouble. Careful. Thank you. Hallo, Mr. Weaver. Good night, Mr. Machin. - See you in the morning. - All right. That was Mrs. Weaver at the restaurant? Aye. Aren't you friends anymore? Who with? Them. No, I've got no need for them. Are you going up? Yes, in a minute. They got a good day for it. Aye. Fit for Saturday? - Champion, Mr. Slomer. - That's the way. We can't manage without Frank. I hope you'll both be very happy. Come on, Judith. Aren't you going to kiss her? I won't be a second, Margaret. Congratulations. Best of luck. Look after her. Well done, Judith. See keeps up to it, and no backsliding. How are you, Mr. Slomer? Margaret! What's the matter? Why'd you run off? In front of everyone. That young girl. I'm ashamed. Ashamed? I'm a kept woman. What did you expect? Oh, my God! It's no good, Frank. That car, me in a fur coat, living in the same house as you. Deal with dirt, you look dirty. People have eyes. You feel like dirt? What do you think? You want to shove me off to another. From what I've hear, you're never short of girls. Why do you stick with me still? You'll leave me soon. That's the first I've heard of it. Of me leaving. I know you. You were beginning to feel happy. Happy? I could say something, but I won't. Go on, say it. I'd like to hear you say all of it. You don't understand at all. You can sell it if you're sure I'm leaving. You can open a shop with the stuff I bought you. It's nothing you haven't had to. You don't understand why I've done these things. Of course I do. It makes you feel good, big. You like to feel big. You don't appreciate what I've done. I've given you a life better than any other woman, but you will not admit it. Admit it? You must be mad. In the street people point at me saying I'm your slut. Who says that? Who? Just listen to him! They all laugh at you, point you out. Trying to be different! And they point me, lan and Lynda out. We're not proper people because you show off every Saturday. You're a great ape on a football field. You want me to be like them. You want me to crawl like the rest. Just look at the rest. Take a good look at them. Look at the bleeding people around you. Not a bleeding man amongst them. You're on your backs and the world clawing above you! Because they haven't the guts. No guts to stand up and walk about like me. Shout as much as you like, but get out. I don't want you in my house. You know you need me. Why not admit it? Leave me alone. I won't leave you alone until you admit it. Margaret, what's the matter? Leave me alone. Aren't you well? Get it into your head. We don't need you. I don't understand her. Nor what she wants from me. "A great ape on a football field" she called me. A great ape on a football field! That's about what we are. She makes me feel like that. She makes me feel clumsy, awkward and big, and stupid. She makes me feel like... she makes me feel like I crush... I crush everything. Maybe you're too rough on her. Some women can't stand it. - Hallo, Frank. - Hallo, Maurice. You took a knock last week. It takes more to lay you out. See you do better next Saturday. That's what they think of me? A great ape on a football field. They want someone to act big because they haven't the guts. They want a hero and I'm a hero. But she won't admit it. You understand? She needs me, but she won't admit it. But you can't be like that to a woman. I see. Maurice, I'm not gonna be a footballer for ever. I need something for good, something permanent. You reckon it's her? Grab my hand. I can love someone, can't I? I can, can't I? I can. Perhaps she's the wrong one. I need her. She's the one thing that makes me feel wanted. I can't lose her. You'd better see a doctor. I'm just tired. You going now or in the morning? I'm not going at all. What is it you want? I want nothing that you've got. I'm staying. There's one part of my life you've never touched. You mean Eric? He's the one really good thing you can't touch, Well, let's all pray for the good soul of Eric Hammond. The father of this house! How he must hurt you! Let's put his booths right back in the hearth. You don't know. You don't know. If I've see a crazy thing in my life, that's it. I know enough to keep you in a rubber room for life. You know nothing about Eric or me. I know he put the file through his guts. You made him so happy, he killed himself. You want to kill me? Eric is dead, you understand? Eric is dead. You make me feel I'm nothing. I want you. You want to crush me, but I won't let you. I'm the one thing you can't have. I want you. I want you to go. I need you. I want you to go. I want you to go. Get out! - Get out! - Margaret. Oh, please. Please leave me alone. I can't. Leave me alone. I can't, I love you. I want you to go. All right, I'm going. The last you'll ever see. You're not in any trouble? I'll take your word for it. I don't mind who I take. But any trouble, and no thank you. That's why I gave you that queer look now. I do when I think people might cause trouble. I find it puts them off. Johnson still live here? He went a while ago. This is yours. You'll be all right here, Whacker. Got a lock on that? These 2 alarm clocks are nippy, but they're nice. Down here for a holiday? That your car out there? The nippers are mustard here. It'll be spare parts if you leave it. I'll clean it for a dollar. Is that you? Is that you, Frank? You dirty bastard! Mr. Machin! Mr. Machin! Mrs. Hammond is ill in hospital. I've got Lynda and lan with me. What? Mrs. Hammond's been taken ill. What is it? It's an attack. Some sort of attack. I've got Lynda and lan with me. Where is she? It's the County. Just a couple of days. She's badly. It's a brain haemorrhage. Is that serious? Serious? Oh, yes, it's serious. I mean, she won't die? I'm afraid I can't say. She's weak all through. She hasn't the strength. And I doubt she even has the will. Where is she? You'd better leave her now. Margaret. Margaret. Margaret, it's nothing. It's nothing at all. It's nothing, Margaret. You're all right. You're all right. You'll be all right, Margaret. You'll be all right now. You're safe. You're safe, Margaret. Margaret. You can't go like this. You can't leave me. You mustn't be mean. Margaret. Margaret. You can't leave me. You can't. You mustn't be mean. Doctor! She's gone. Sorry. No! No, she's not. No, she's not! No! Margaret! Margaret! Oh, Margaret! Margaret! Come on, Machin, get a bloody move on.
