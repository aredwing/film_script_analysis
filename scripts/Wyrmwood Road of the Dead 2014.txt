Yesterday I went pig huntin' with my brothers Mulla and Tony. I drove the car. Tony brought his blues guitar. Mulla brought his favorite rifle. And I brought my mean little sawed off pistol grip 12 gauge. We went bush. There was a strange feelin' in the air. Dead silent. That night I... I... we made a fire. Like I usually do. We just sat there barely talkin'. Then Mulla sees it. Shooting stars. Everywhere. I look up and I see them lightin' up the sky. And I'm scared. I get a feelin'. I get a feelin' right.. Here. That night.. It took me ages to go to sleep. And when I did.. I dreamed bad things. I woke up in the morning.. Mulla and Tony were gone. Then, I saw blood trails. I followed them. I saw Mulla. He was dead. I look out into the bush and I see Tony. I called out to him. Tony! Then he turns. That's not me brother. Then he came at me. And I just run. Yellin' at him to stop. But he just keeps comin'. After a while I get tired and I just start walkin'. I must have went like that for hours. Me walkin' and him chasin'. Then I turn, aim the gun. I took out his legs. I blew his kneecap off. Then he starts crawlin' at me. I aim for his head. I couldn't do it. I should have shot him. Barry. You got any stories? This morning I shot my wife and child with a nail gun. I don't know how to make that into a story. Uh-uh. Get rid of it. Wash your hands. So I told Kaytlin that kissed Jason but Jason's not officially going out with Kaytlin. Like they're just friends, but he also told Angie that they were friends with benefits type deal. So I don't know what to believe. Jason told Max that they were like going steady. Come on, Meganne. Hang up the phone. One second. So like Tea's like, "Oh, my God, everyone thinks I'm a slut." - Meganne! - And I was like.. - Oi! - ...no, they don't. But they so do. Watch your language, please. - Put your phone away. - I'm talking to Lisa. I don't care if you're talking to Jesus. Off your phone or you'll lose it. - Do as you're told. - I gotta go, Lisa. Mum's having a hissy fit. Okay. Laters. - Oh, Barry. - You're a full grub, dad. Can you not be a barbarian just for 3 minutes? I'm sorry, babe. Meganne, come on. Eat properly. Night, hon. Stop it. You're crazy. Yes. Yep. Nice, Charlie. Yes, nice. Do that one more time for me, babe? - Charlie! Shh! - Oh, God. Hon, what's the matter? What... the fuck is that? Charlie! Charlie! Fuck! Charlie, don't.. Aah! Yeah. Oh, Barry! Thank fuck! Fuck! Are you okay? - Is Annie and Meganne safe? - Brooke? Listen, I don't know what the fuck is going on. Everyone is turning crazy. Sherri and Charlie just turned. Their eyes.. Their eyes went fucking white. Just slow down. I had to chop off Sherri's head with a God damn shovel. Whoa whoa whoa! Calm down. Where are you? I'm in the studio in Bulla Bulla. Barry, listen to me, you gotta get somewhere safe, man. You gotta get out of the city... like fuck! F.. Chook? Daddy. There's someone in the kitchen. Barry. No, just... Barry, just stay here. Just call the police. Call the cops. A little help! Get this thing off me. Get the axe! Get the fucking axe! Hurry up. What are you waiting for? Meganne! Get back in the bedroom! Go! Go! - Straight to the car. - Uh-huh. Barry, come on! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Meganne, get in the back, honey. Keep your seatbelt on. Come on, Meganne. Hold on. Shit. - Daddy! - Close your eyes, honey. Clear. What the fuck are you doing? Oi! We can ball gag ya or you can shut up. Just relax. This is for your own good. See this? This is going to go into your neck. And if you keep struggling you're gonna rip up your own veins. - Okay? - Mm-hmm. Keep still. Good. Good. Good. There's a good girl. Is she good? She's good. Let's put her out. What the fuck did you do that for? Looks like we're gonna have to put her out the old fashioned way, sarge. Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait. Meganne, put your mask on. Get her mask on. Meganne, sweetie, you have to put your... Meganne! Barry, stop... Barry stop the car. Stop the car! Meganne! She's not breathing! - Honey? - Meganne! Meganne! How could it possi.. Honey? Barry. - No, keep that on. - No. - Keep it on. - No! I can feel it. No. No! Here, quick.. I love you so much. I love you. I'm sorry. Aah! Stay back! Stay back! Stay back! I'm sorry, baby. Ooh!

No, you're just due for another top up. Now, you are one lucky, lucky, lucky little girl. Because you've stayed up past your bedtime you get to see what the adults do after dark. Now hold still. Hold still! If I get this wrong, you could go into a seizure and die. Huh? Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. That's a good girl. We only have to do this five more times. I want that truck. Oi! Oi! Can we come inside? There's fucking zombies everywhere. Yeah, okay. How do we get in? Alright. Let them get close to ya then run around 'em. Okay. Just make sure that door comes up. Run ya bastards! Nice shootin', mate. Thanks, mate. There's a lot of good shit in here we can use, ay? What's that, mate? That Hilux out in the front. Which one of you... That Hilux ain't goin' nowhere. Yeah? Why's that? You drove from the city, right? - Right. - Where's your car? Broke down. Engine trouble? Yeah, right. I need to show you boys somethin'. Petrol. Metho. Kero. Right? Last time I checked they were flammable liquids, weren't they? How old's that stuff? Brand spanking new, mate. We bought it last week. So your car just stopped, ay? I guess that would explain it. What the fuck! Who's that? That's Neville. Oh! That's fucking rank. He's farting out of his mouth. Weird, eh? Oh, fuck him. Night, Neville. - Whoa! Shit! - What the fucking fuck? The blood is flammable! Oi, wake up, Neville. Come on. We need petrol, right? - Right. - Wrong. We need fuel. There's no way that could work. There's one way to find out. Let's get him out of there. Alright, Kel, give it a crank now. Oh, fuck! Come on! You beauty. Good on ya, Neville. If we can get that truck inside, we can definitely hook him up. Drive the fuck out of here. That's gonna be a mission but, eh? And it's doable. We need to armor up. Big time. Fuck ya. They're goin' for it! Ready? - Born ready. - Alright. Let's do this. Come on you fuckin' zombies! I'm out! Same! Fuck! It bit it off! That thing bit me fucking nose off! Frankie, how does it look, mate? Is me nose gone? Is it bit off? Tell me, Frankie. Yeah, there's not much nose left, mate. Kel! - What is it? - Your fuckin' eyes, mate! What... what about me fuckin' eyes, Frankie? What's up with 'em? Move out of the way, Frank. Wait! Wait! What're you fuckin' doing? - He's gonna turn any second. - He's a mate! Get some fucking rope, Frank! This is bullshit. What the fuck is that? Well, this my friend, is a gas-powered harpoon. I built it for a mate, so he can hunt sharks in Perth. Is that thing legal? Don't be stupid. Does it work? I'd move out of the way if I were you. Fuck me! Bull's eye! Once that door goes up, that's it. We're on our way. Has everyone got everything they need? Yep. - Ready as we're gonna be. - Righto. Wait a minute! Frank? Yeah, mate? Did you turn the stove off? Right. Let it rip, Benny. Hey! What the fuck do you think you're doing? He fucking kicked me in the balls! Get him up on the wall and get out of my lab, you moron! You call me a moron again, I'll fucking drop ya. By which you'll be demonstrating your superior intellect. Good comeback! These people! Honestly! Oi! Should we stop for petrol? I need to piss. I need to piss. You're gonna have to wait, mate. Barry.. That means pull the truck over so I can urinate. Can't you hold on? We're nearly there. Just be quick. Mate, take the rifle. Frank, I'm just taking a piss, mate. Take the fuckin' rifle. Fuck. I can't hold the rifle and my massive cock at the same time, Frank. But if you want to come out and hold one of 'em, I'll be flattered mate! Fuck off! Come on, Benny. Hurry up. Don't pressure me, Barry. It's getting dark out here. Whoa. Hurry up, Benny. What the fuck! Get back in the truck, you fucking idiot! So what did you learn? - Never get out of the truck! - Let's get out of here. Are you, uh, gonna put your cock away first? No! Alright. Oh, you're fucking joking! Jesus, Mary, and Joseph. They're not making any gas. He's empty you reckon? Nah, he's not empty. Have a look at him. Last night was Neville breathing the gas? Nah, that only really started up this morning. It's getting dark, ay. Yeah. They stop breathing the gas at night. That's why they're faster. They're using it themselves. We're fucked! Boys! Get in the fucking truck! Get in the truck, Frank. Get in the truck. Get your helmets on. Oh. Fuck me! It's gonna be a long night. What do ya reckon, Frank? This is the worst fuckin' nightmare of your life or what? No fuckin' way, mate. What the fuck could be worse than this? About 15 years ago the doctor told me my son had brain cancer. He was only 7-years-old. Talk about shitting yourself. He died in my arms. That was way worse than this. This is fuckin' nothin'. Sorry to hear about that, Frank. Yeah, well. These things happen, ay. Baz? So what I've been wondering is... How come we're not like them? How come we never turned? Wyrmwood. What? You never read the Bible? Nah, man. I don't read that shit. In Revelations when the third angel blows his trumpet. A star called Wyrmwood falls to the Earth bringing a disease that kills a fuckload of people. That's pretty much the beginning of the end Biblically speaking. When I seen those meteor showers last night.. And then in the morning all these dead bastards come running outta the bushes I figured we were pretty deep into that final judgment, you know? - Yeah? - Yeah. When the end comes all the good folks go upstairs, and all the bad folks go downstairs and there's a bunch of poor bastards left in the middle. What happens to them? They undergo a trial by fire. They get tested by God. So you reckon we're being tested right now? Yeah. I reckon we are. I fucking hate tests. I'm gonna try and get some sleep. If one of them bastards gets in here and kills me, wake us up, will you? Aah! What the fuck... what the fuck's going on? - Fuck! - Is that fire? - What happened? - I don't know. I shot one of them in the face and the fucker lit up. What? What did you do that for? - Fuck. - If that fire reaches the compressor, we're stuffed. You think I don't know that, Frank? - I'm going up there. - No, you're fucking not. There's a shitload of them things out there, mate. What else am I gonna do? Look, I'm gonna go out there and put the fire out. Fuck those things! Take the helmet. Put it on. Let's do this. Fuck you! You ugly fuckers! Barry! What the fuck's going on? Fuck. Barry! Ah! Lock it! Fuck! Frank, did it bite you? Frank! Did it bite you, mate? - The medical box. - Ay? The fucking... The fucking medical box at your feet! Oh. You want some bandages? Open it. Oh, beers. - You want a beer, Frank? - What do you fucking reckon? Take a drink. Take a fucking drink! Gimme some. I can't do it. I'm Catholic. I can't do it. Come on, mate! It's okay. It's alright. I've had a good life. Just make sure you do it while I'm still me, yep. I'm really sorry, mate. Fucking do it! Mind if I finish this? Oh, oh, oh. Oh, fuck man. Fuck off, meathead. Oh, I think I'm gonna spew. I've got a pounding hangover. Oh, nice one. Gimme a hand with Frank. Come on. Nice one! Let's get the fuck out of here, ay! Yeah. Let's do it. You gonna say something? What's there to say? What was that? He's safe now. That crow will come and take his spirit. Nice. Come on, let's go. You boys military? Yeah. You guys know what's been going on here? - You fellas A negative - What? - 'Course they're fucking A negative, Thommo. - What's he talking about? All we know is there's something in the air that's changing people. Anyone with an A negative blood type is unaffected. That's obviously you, fellas. People with any other blood type.. Not so lucky. So where are you boys headed? North. - We're going to Bulla Bulla. - Bulla Bulla? Why? To get his sister. That's a pretty bad idea. We've just come from Bulla Bulla. It's not looking good there's infected everywhere. Whoa, whoa, whoa, easy, fellas! Alright, look, we're all friends here, okay? We got a call from our captain about 10 minutes ago and now, he's in a roving unit, just down the road, okay? Now, he said, he picked up a couple of A negative blood types. Survivors just like you two. What was your sister's name? Brooke. Yeah, right. I'm pretty sure one of them was Brooke. Well, how about I go and radio our captain and confirm that for you, huh? Yeah, you do that. Well, they've definitely got a Brooke. Well, I wanna speak to whoever's on that radio. Listen, now you hear me out. Just relax, hop back in your car and I will take you to your sister. Just tell me where she is. Look, mate, I don't even have time for this shit, alright? There are about a million things that I have to do right now. And you boys, you're pretty low on my priority list. So hop back in your car, and you follow me or don't. You're choice. Thommo, we're rolling. Well, what's it gonna be? We'll follow you. They seem like nice blokes.. ...or not. - I don't like it. - Don't like what? Don't know. That guy's full of shit. Fuck. It's time. You! What the fuck? Those lying fucks. That's Brooke! Brooke! Barry? Oh, shit! Quick! Jump! Jump! Quickly! - Shit! - They're shooting at us! Go! Go! Go! Hold on! Woo-hoo! - Fuck! - What's that sound? - Come on! - What's the problem? I don't know. You okay? What happened back there? Oh, fuck me dead, Barry! They blew this joker's head off. Shit. We need to find a zombie fast. Zombie? What do we need a zombie for? This truck runs on zombies. No zombies, no truck. Come on, you dead bastards! Come and get it! Where are ya? You want a zombie? Yeah. I'll get you a zombie. Fuck! Brooke, what the fuck's wrong with your eyes? Don't shoot him. Shit! Alright, what the fuck just happened then? Where do you want him? Back of the truck. She can control fucking zombies! What? Come on. - What are we waiting for? - We need mask on that thing's mouth. - What mask? - The mask! The blue fucking mask! Okay. Go! The joke's on me now, bro. You okay? Nah I'm fucked. What the fuck are you doing? Putting pressure on the wound. It'll stop the bleeding. Just fuckin' warn me next time, ay? Sorry. You're better-looking than your brother. So are you. I'm Brooke. I know. I'm Benny. Thanks for helping me out back there, Benny. No problem, darling. Nice to finally meet ya. I wish I could say I'd heard a lot about ya. But your brother there is a bit of a tight-lipped bastard. Yeah. I guess it runs in the family. Hey, Barry? Where's Annie and Megan? They're dead. My brother Mulla he's up there in the trees laughing at me the bastard. Barry, we're gonna have to pull over. Benny's not good. Fuck. Alright, I'm gonna pull off road. There you go, mate. It's a nice day for it. Oi! I want you to leave me here, bro. Don't be stupid. Listen to me. Just give me a gun and plenty of bullets. I can take care of meself. I know you can, mate. There's no bloody way I'm leavin' you here. Let's take a look at this thing, ay? Shit. You two gotta keep moving, you know that. Fuck that bullshit. We're gonna patch you up and we're all leaving here together. No, I'm not getting back in that truck. Yeah, you are. Brooke? Brooky! Brooke! You alright? Oh, God! Fuck me! No. Something's happening to me. Come here. I killed them both. Could you do it for me? I don't know if I can. Give me the gun. Will you hold my hand? Give me the gun. Run! Go! Come on fuckheads! Wakey, wakey. Call to your sister. Go fuck yourself! Thompson. Rubber bullets. They pack quite a punch though, don't they? You wanna know what the real one feels like, mate? The real one feels like shit, Barry. Call to your sister. Nah, she'll be right. Go and get the pliers. Call to your sister. Fuck you! Fuck me! You ever seen 'em move that fast in the daytime before, boss? McLaughlin. - Yes, boss. - Take another nail out. Stop! Oh, shit. Put 'em on. Ah, fuck this shit! Come on! Leave her alone, you fucking bastards. Shut up, dickhead. Easy, easy. Sorry about him. Listen up. They want us to take the girl's head off and chuck it in the icebox for later. Fuck yeah. Actually, boss, I've got just the thing for this. - It's over in the truck. - Go and get it now. Hey, Benny. You got those matches on you mate? Yeah. Gimme 'em, ay? Why? I'm gonna take us all out. Ay? See that compressor up there? I'm gonna blow it up. Be like a fucking atom bomb went off. Can we talk about a possible alternative? We got no time, mate. We're dead anyway, you know that. I got a better idea. Fuck's sake, what? I let him up there bite me. What the fuck are you talking about? I've got a number 7 killer boomerang hidden under the truck. Sharp as fuck. - A boomerang? - Yeah. Your sister, she can control zombies. Yeah, so? So, I'll be a zombie. That bloke she killed over there.. His gun. What? Benny, give me the fucking matches. Now. You want a head taken off? You use a fuckin' sword. Where the fuck did you get that? Who cares? Let's get this done. Fuck yeah, boss. Leave her alone, you fucking bastards. Fuckin' touch her... Benny they're about to chop my sister's fucking head off. Now give me the fucking matches. What about my idea? What about your idea? You're rambling. You're not making any fucking sense, mate. I'm rambling, am I? Give me the fucking matches, Benny. McLaughlin, you help me hold her down? Thompson, you're cutting. With pleasure, boss. - You want the matches? - For fuck's sake, now. Here's the matches. Fucking wanker. Come on. Come here, you bastard. You're going down, ball buster. One. Two. Three. Drop the gun or they attack. No! No! No! No! You fuckers! Ah, fuck! I'm guessing you're not an A negative blood type, mate. You're done, son. Just a matter of time. Well played. There's more at stake here than you know, mate. It's not about you, or you sister, or your mates. It's about the survival of the human fucking race, mate! Do you understand? You're a piece of shit. You wanna fight me, mate? I wanna rip your fucking head off. Fuck it. You and me go round and round. Come on then, take a fucking swing. Come on. Come on, mate. Don't you fucking pussy out on me now. Stand up. Good boy. Now, I could snap your fucking neck in half, right now. Oh, you... Oh, fuck! Never... never ever.. Grab a man's balls in a fist fight. It shows low character. What about using a gun? You're a fucking dog. Dog, am I? You're the fucking dog, mate. Jesus Christ. Fuckin', this shit is over, mate, alright? I'm telling ya, some blokes.. Just don't know.. When.. To quit. Well, there you go. You're right back where you started. Didn't exactly rip my fucking head off did ya, mate? Fuck, hey. Shit. They are fucking disgusting. Where are you going mate?
