Hold me like this. Okay, stop. The hand has to go straight under this part of the head, and the other hand behind his head. Do you feel safe? The first time I felt had supernatural powers priate was returning from a wedding. Usually I sleep during long journeys, especially when I return late at night but this time, surprisingly, I did not. My husband drove the car and I was listening to the radio, I was surprised when suddenly bright lights. A huge truck. I turned abruptly the wheel and we were saved. My husband is usually asleep, You should have seen how he woke up! And all this comes from your active connections with aliens? When my father died, I felt very strange could not get out of bed slept for hours. The strangest thing was that no change of position. People generally moves four or five times a night. - Alfred. - Alfred? My husband was terrified, tried in vain to wake up several times. As if I were not there, and really was not. Was elsewhere. - The death of your father caused this? - Not exactly. The emotional state sensitive where I was... I did recover distant memories of childhood. As a child of 3 or 4 years I was actually abducted and conducted experiments on me. I remember very clearly a white room. I have to ask you something, Sorry to interrupt. Okay, I'm all ears. You're a poet, author, and people will admire. Are not you afraid that when this report is posted to hurt you? People will think you've gone mad! First thing, my dear, is not the first time that people think... how shall we say, I've gone crazy. But I think the opposite. You'll see people out of the closet, the masses have been abducted by aliens. Have you ever wondered why we do not treat with love for each other? No! Do you know why? - Because people are afraid to admit it. - What? His alien-N:. So he said "I can do without you" and I said, "Yes?" "When you go wrong not come to me crying. " Wait, you had a date last night! Well, how was it? He was handsome, went to a restaurant really romantic. Soft music... He had a sense of humor. I do not think you go out with a celebrity. It is not a celebrity, is a journalist. Only one was chosen as the sexiest guys in town. Just do not understand why he seeks quotes online. It may be because it is difficult to find normal couples like that. Sorry, I did not want to hurt you. Anyway, I heard someone she heard some guy that had been lying he had a huge machine. Hush! I can not believe how you talk. Wait, you have picked? - Do not ask me why, okay? - Tell me. I think it's that bag there. "I can help? - No. - Okay. Are you interested in a brochure? No. I am here at your service. Is it a smell test? What do you mean? I say that if something is rotting inside Do you smell from outside? - I suppose in a state, yes. - Sooner or later? Honestly I have no idea. I do not think I serve. - Hello. - Hi, Shoshana, how are you? Thanks, one slight problem with the heart but everything else is fine. I have a book that is right for you. Come later. - Have you seen my son? - In the office, books lining. Then I'll go see him. bye, thanks. - Do not you greet me? - Mom! Do not I deserve a Kiss? What are you doing here?

You're my son! - What are you doing here? - I went through the cafeteria, -... Vi. Shirley. - Did you talk to her? No, she should apologize first. There is nothing that should apologize. You do not cancel a wedding at the last minute. Mom, is not the place to talk about this, and is not okay to talk behind the backs of Shirley. - You never want to talk to me. - Maybe tonight. Tomorrow, Friday is your birthday. I thought, maybe you can bring. We will sit together will make a luxurious meal. Maybe. I can not promise. Great, then I see you on your birthday. Meanwhile eat something before going to the restaurant. Save some money. All right. I'm going now, goodbye. Tell me the truth now, "Were never abducted? I think not. But someone affected, ... Someone more powerful than you. What do you mean? Someone has an "effector" which is how I call them, "Someone who affects the other." Occasionally, they are aliens who watch over humans. There are hundreds of thousands across the world. I do not think any have been affected, I did what I always wanted. Nobody touched me. But you want. I am looking for an "effector", you know. I think I've found one. Would not surprise me that it had happened. Hello. Hello. "I can sit? - How are you? - Okay. - Not likely. - I'm fine. - Are you angry with me? - No. I called you last night no reply. I did not answer I went out with someone last night.

Last night I was alone in the office, I worked overtime. I had another call, Suddenly I heard all sorts of strange voices and they talked about a disaster to come. A private disaster or universal? Universal, I think. I only Habaron personal things, They asked me questions as on the death of my father How I felt, How I saved my husband and me of an accident. Questions on emotion. They've been quiet lately. For some time now have not been contacted. They do not come to take me again I do not love me. They love you, love you, but at the moment are not useful. Maybe your aura scares; are very sensitive to auras. And yours is pretty terrifying too green. What do you think should I do? - They did not mention anything specific. - What about you? - Were you exposed to them? - No. You're lying! How dare you talk like that our guest? He is lying. - No lie. - Whatever you say. Are you okay? - We can go. - I want to stay. The energies are too negative here. I can see their aura and this is not helping. You never told me what you think. Is it going to happen or something big I misunderstood the message? As always, got it wrong. I think we talked about you personally, they do not deal with prophecies. Yes they do. I told you! Prophesied my parents' divorce as a child. Tell us. My sister was still a baby I remember looking through a crack the door of my parents. They discussed almost every night. Suddenly someone stood beside me and asked if I wanted to be separated. I said yes, and he said they would in a few years. I remember his face was so strange... I had a strange feeling to you, I knew I had to bring you here. Are you absolutely sure they were aliens? I think so. This park is beautiful, years ago had not been here. I smoked weed here when I was in college. When I was really small, I used to ride a bike here. We lived across the street. In fact, I still live there. Do you live with your parents? Actually, my ex-boyfriend. My parents died in an accident traffic a year ago is why I returned to Israel. Sorry... All right. Either way, I live across the street. So, you live with your ex-boyfriend? Yes, we get along well. You know, find a flatmate today is a nightmare. While there is no jealousy, going well. So you live across the street? The other side is not so far this is not London. Like when you're a kid and you have no sense of proportion, the city seems so big. Although just have 300,000. 371 600 at the end of 2006. What I mean is that when you're a child, what is more important seems negligible, and then suddenly things change. Our desires change over the years. Here is where I live. Here. Bonito. Want to get a coffee? I want to, but I have an appointment. I'm meeting someone. I met him yesterday but I was impressed. I love coffee, but... Do you understand me, right? Okay, do not let him planted. I would feel bad afterwards. Sorry. Good. Good.
