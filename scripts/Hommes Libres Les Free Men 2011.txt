A memo from the political director ... Ministry of Police Vichy to the Minister. The occupation ... suspects That the Mosque of Paris ... Provides false papers to persons of the Jewish race ... As they if they had converted to Islam. The imam is must stop doing this immediately. As many Israelites take any opportunity ... To hide their identity. " Major ... I don't believe a word of it.

Do you have family in Paris? I have a brother in Germany. What's he doing? He's in a camp. Soon he will be liberated. Perhaps we can see each other? Hello? Can you give us a minute? What is it? I just heard ... that there's going to be a large raid ... in the 11th arrondissement. I don't know what they want ... but I would leave France. Go to Morocco. You'll be safe. I have friends you can hide with them. I won't leave. I'm waiting for someone. As you wish. I want to stay as long as possible. I always have those papers. Which are no longer valid. The Germans know about the false papers. Listen, Salim. If you are caught ... say that your father is in the Islamic cemetery in Bobigny. My father? -That is hard proof ... that you too are Muslim. There is no news about her. Where'd she go? To a meeting. With who? Don't ask too many questions. We'll tell you tonight. He's with me. Excluded for collaboration with the fascists. One year ago ...

Are you sure? -Yes. Let him go. Get out. Younes, where were you? Larbi. Listen, Salim. The police arrested everyone. Did you hear me? This is Mohamed Abdel Wahab. I've wanted to sing with him for years. Listen. I would likme to welcome ... one of the most beautiful voices I know: Salim Halali. Salim, please join me on stage? Salim Halali? Police. Come with me. Today there were thousands Jewish families arrested ... in Paris. Men, women and children. Something is coming. Something terrible, I fear. What do we do about Salim? Do you know the Muslim cemetery? And? -He says he is Muslim. Do you have evidence? Who's to say that you're not an Algerian jew? My father is Muslim He's at the cemetery in Bobigny. Go and check. Where is his grave? I'm sure that you won't find it. Si Brahim Halali Are you okay, Salim? I have a weapon. There's no danger. I thought too, until I was arrested. The next time I'm done. There will be no next time. Who changed the grave? You? Your jacket. Don't stay here. This is London. The Free French radio. This morning landed in Morocco and Algeria led by General Eisenhower. This operation was possible thanks to French resistance groups ... that the Anglo-Saxons have persuaded. General De Gaulle and the Free French, congratulations ... for your courage and determination. And now a few private messages. The predator has eaten lobster. I repeat ... ... Don't carry a blow. Excellence ... -Welcome, Major. And, may I see the decoration? Please be seated. You know that he was promised it. But you need to go to him in Morocco to accept it. The sultan wants to keep the tradition alive. To Morocco? You're not serious. It's occupied by the Americans. Unfortunately. Nobody but the King can award it ... without breaking protocol. You know that the Ouissam Alaouite the highest award is ... only ever awarded by the king himself. You are very clever. But I have bad news for you. Until now, our military leadership ... have spared the Muslims. But that will change now. The counter-espionage, the Gestapo, has started looking into your activities. You are in danger. I wanted to warn you. ln danger? But why? That I don't know. But you ... must surely know. This is our last meeting. I am leaving Paris. No problems? -No. Francis wanted to talk to you. -What does he want? Leila. She's in danger. Her brother has been tortured. They may be executed. Why? You must know the truth. Her name is not Leila, but Warda Slimane. She's with the Algerian Communists. They fled after arrests ... and the French police were looking for her. They're moving her to Fresnes tomorrow. German stuff. Excellent quality. Don't get caught. You know what you're risking. They're not cigarettes. Don't worry, Omar. Who is it for? For friends. By this war we will be independent. Many boys will believe it. Hopefully they won't know failure. God grant it. Love says: He who gives his life ... gets 1001 lives in return. Who's there? Younes. I'm busy. Are you asleep yet? What do you want? Come sing for Maryvonne's birthday. I won't sing anymore. Come on. Get up. Get dressed. Come. Let me be, Younes. I said that you would come. Don't make me a liar. Is there alcohol at your Breton's house? What happened? He's Jewish, right? Why? -Just. I heard that. The Americans have landed. The women shouted and left their men in the lurch The blue eyes with their full bags walk down the street and attract the girls Now she is proud because she is popular with the Americans. Everywhere you hear OK, OK They share cigars and dollars Old women buy nylon stockings Even small children treat them with respect The Americans Everywhere you hear OK, OK Come on, bye bye Congratulations.

I'm coming with you. -It's too dangerous. I'm coming, I said. Duck. Warn the others. Can you walk? -Yes. No organs affected, but a lot of blood loss. Where is he? -Excuse me? There's a wounded terrorist here. There was this morning, but he's gone. I alerted the police straight away. Beware, that is the TB ward. Enter, but at your own risk. Omar. You know him? An German informer. That's who brings him his merchandise. -What merchandise? There's a car behind us. We're being followed. What do we do? -Put your foot down! They hit us. Faster. Get out. You there. Comer on out. -Walk. Hands up. Hurry up. Quickly. Come. You should have warned me. I would not have agreed. The hospital is full of informers. Everybody knows that. You've put the mosque in danger. What were you thinking of? The mosque watched is night and day. The medical director was shot by the Germans. Now I need to evacuate the basement. For that I will need your help. Then you must return to your country. Back? -You know what Omar has done? He tipped off the Gestapo that you were at the hospital. And now, they're looking for you. Hurry up. Close off all the exits. Come on, hurry up. We're going. Ghabrit said that you'd left. That we won't see each other again. That night ... That's past. Her sister is missing. Where is your sister? -She's looking for my nou-nou. Be right back. -We're waiting for you. What's going on? Today is a holy Muslim holiday. A little respect, please. This is unacceptable.
