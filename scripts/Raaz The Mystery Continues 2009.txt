Far, far away, a wave is made.. and turns into a Tsunami. Similarly, a storm and it's disastrous waves start moving slowly towards us. But when we find that out. lt's too late then. The time has come. lt is about to start. O my God. Tell everyone. Everyone. He won't do anything to me. He won't harm me. Because.. l'm free. Did you hear me? l'm being freed. l'm being freed. l've got salvation. O Baby, you're simply the best. Just superb. l'm so happy that you've decided to start working again. You'll see that you'll get to the top in no time. And nobody will be able to stop you. Anyway, now get ready quickly because we have to go the party of the sponsors. We have to meet so many people there. To make new friends. - l'm in no mood. My God! Stop making these excuses. l'm not going to listen to anything. l'll just see you there. Ok? Hey, it's me. How are you? l'm fine. Are you fine or you're lying? Yash, my show is today. l have to leave. Don't worry l won't take much time of yours. There's award function. At the Taj. My program has been nominated. That's why l've just called you to invite you for it. That's it. After my show, l'll have to go for a party. l know you're busy. But if you'll come, l'll feel good. But if you can't. l'll understand. You take care. What was Yash saying? Nothing, just... He was inviting me for his party. And you must have gone. Haven't you? lt's not like that. Try to understand. l have no problem with you and Yash's relationship. And you really love him. But shall we keep ourselves tied with one relationship all the life? ls it necessary? l know what Yash thinks about your work. Whenever you went to him... You've ignored yourself and your work totally. You know, it's so important to have your own identity today. You've come out of it all after too much struggle. Please don't go back to him. l'm not going back to him. We two were good friends as well. Good friends. l know that one. Anyway, if you want to go. By all means please go to Yash's party. But remember. lf you go to him it will all start again. There's nothing going to happen like that. l promise. The drama that has been being played in the name of God in this country it only makes us look like idiots. Where we were a thousands years ago:: we are still right there. We are still tied up with the shackles of superstition. Sometimes they say that the idol is drinking milk. Sometimes salt water becomes sweet. Sometime a monkey starts praying. Etcetera, etcetera. l mean... the truth is.. that our heart doesn't want to admit. That lndia's progress is related to the progress in our thinking. lf we are dreaming to become an economic super power, we must have to fight with these problem of superstition. Remember, the most dangerous imagination of the mind that has made the atom bomb, is ''the God''. And the non-stop rituals in the name of Gods. ln this country where the family daily soups get the maximum TRPs. The success of a show that's based on superstition, gives me and my team get the courage. So guys please, give a huge round of applause to the entire teams of ''Anth Vishwas'' You rock. Thank you for making ''Anth Vishwas'' won: Vishal, you too. And yes of course. But most of all, l want to thank someone because of whom l'm here today. Had she not been there, l might have been a small reporter in some news channel. Not here. Nandita, my love. You've done a lot for me all the time. Whatever l am today, it's only because of you. You deserve this award as much as l do. Shall l leave the keys? This house is not running away. Yash, l've always longed for such a house. Whom l could call mine. l can't believe this. lt's too expensive, isn't it? Can we afford it? You said it yourself. By selling some reality and... - Yes l know. Sell reality and buy dreams. Everyone does. What's wrong if we do that too? Yash, l want this house. At any cost. - lt's all yours. lt's all yours. Listen to me. Security is about to throw us out in 2 minutes. l have to catch a flight at 6. Why don't you understand? All right, go. Go now. lt's fitting you. l'm buying it. And l'll meet you in parking. My wallet? Listen Nandita my... l have been calling you for long. What happened? There was a guy in the mall, he was staring at me. ln a very strange way. He must be a fan. Forget it. l'm gonna crash. Got a flight at 6 in the morning. What does it say? Positive. l can't believe you Nandita. l mean, you can be so careless. You always go back to that man. Then you get pregnant. Do you know how stupid you are? lf you to stay away from bad spirits, keep this Geeta. lt will always protect you. Driver, lets go. l have a very bad habbit of startling people. No But l think l know you. ls that why you're following me? Yes past few days. And believe me it's first time l've gone through this much trouble. And what and why am l doing... l don't ask these question to myself. Give me two minutes. l'll explain everything. Just two minutes. My name is Prithvi. l'm an artist by profession. Every artist try to make his best painting in life. His master piece. l also tried. Tries very hard. l kept my self alone. Then l made this. l didn't tell anyone to make my painting. One night a photo came into my mind. l made this four months ago. At that time l didn't know that someone owns this face. l made this painting last night. Something bad is going to happen to you: Do you beleive in ghosts? What happened? Have you gone mad? Why were you breaking the door? Key was stuck in the lock. Couldn't you ring the bell? l forgot the bag in the kitchen. l can't hear you. Stop the car. What is happening? They're Aghori. Boss please let's go from here. lt's not right. lt's the night when they chant to protect themselves from ghosts. What is this foreigner doing here? Go get the camera. Boss listen to me. We better not get involved in this. Even priests are afraid of them. This is the international angle. Go and get the camera. This is 21st century's lndia. At one side it's dreaming about globalization. And on the other side. Still can't get rid of the old rituals and foolishness. How? Let's see. Today is full moon night. This is the night. When ghosts and supernatural forces with their full strength... ...land on this earth. This is the night. When Aghori praise these ghosts... ...to be victorious on death... ...and to be powerful. And they request supernatural powers: And they make themselves powerfull. We don't believe that. People do. lt is also beleived that people who are mentaly weak and superstitious. Ghosts can control them very easly. Don't be shocked. You can also catch this disease. Now dicision is in your hands. ls this country going forward? or like always... lt's going in reverse gear? With cameraman Vishal Roy. Yash Dayal. Zee News. But we'll keep her under obsevation till evening. Bleeding was too much. Sorry we couldn't save the child. Child! So what did you see? lt seemed like someone was drowing. How much did you drink at that time? That child. You were pregnant. And you didn't even tell me. You were working. l didn't want to disturb you. You don't have any right to make feel this way. By hurting yourself... What are you trying to prove? Yash, you think l did this? What are you saying? Your doctors are saying that. Yash you know that l love myself. Why would l do this? Why would l hurt myself? Then who did it? Who would hurt you so bad? l know... lt's the same man... He was following me that night. Yash try to understand. He followed me to the elevator and he showed me paintings. He showed me a painting in which l had cuts on my hands just like this. He did this. He used to work in a Ad agency in Chenai. He's an artist by profession. His father was in military. l have investigated everything. He has no crimnal record. You'll have erase it. Yash, he saved Nadita's life. He faught with your watchman and some how got into your house. He broke the door and took her out of the bathroom. He called the ambulance. You should thank him. But l'm not happy to meet you. Nature has given you a rare gift and you can't protect it. And there's me... Who wouldn't let her photo get dirty. Anyways... you must have your reasons. Why were you following Nandita? And how did you find out about this? That she's going to kill her self. Watchman was inside the building and he didn't hear her voice. And you heard her outside. l was also thinking that. But l know that how do l know all this. That how did l her and your watchman didn't. Why do l follow her. Why are you bothering me. l don't ask that many question to my heart. lt would've been better if l didn't know all this. lt's a habbit. l hope we won't meet again. lt's stinking. Don't know what is happening. Boss has called many times. Every case should be solved before the carnival. He was saying that higher people are presuring. Foreigners also come here... lf they see all this. No one would come here again. l can hear you heart beat from there. You're in trouble. Very big trouble. Understood? We are fotunate that... ...that Maha Rishi Jee has come here to bless us. He thinks he's very close to God. How long will he run his shop? This world doesn't need a preist like you. You fucking pimp. That girl is possessed by a ghost. That ghost has disrespected me. This has nothing to do with that girl. She doesn't need a doctor. She needs God. Only God can cure her. l can only pray for that girl. May God cure her from this curse soon: l have received many SMS. From our sponsors. Every one is laughing at us. They are saying that Yash... Who always lectures on blind beleives... ...his own girlfriend is walking around with ghost in her body. l can't let the show getting destroyed. Because l've spent five years of my life on this show. Forget about this girl. You know that l won't do this. Once she's okay. l'll bring her in front of the media and everything will be okay. Young man of today. Geeta in his hand! People go to temples to meet the God. They keep his photo in their bag. They hang a photo in the car. But nobody keeps God in their heart. What happened Mr. Baranjpe? You look troubled. l have a habbit of troubling people. This is my father's. You seem like an hardass. You're right sir. That's why l'm an artist. Not a police officer. as you can see the crowd is here. and they are protesting against Nandita Chopra. who attacked on him at fashion show. Welcome to Zee News studio Nandita Gee. l shouldn't have done, what l did. why did you do that, tell us. there are rumors that you are patient of hysteria etc. and you are under treatment. is it true? yeah that's true. people believe that have shade of disturbed soul? so l take it as you are from those people who believes in these type of things? no: thank you very much for coming to our show. no: Yash... what happen? what happen!! what happen... l went to get medicine and l got slip. you scared the hell out of me. you know a lot about me right? l never believe in ghost or anything like that. but.. what is going on with me.. all this made me think about it and.. trust me l don't understand any thing. l don't concern about your problems. why not, whenever any accident occurred to me you were there. you are concern: have mercy on my condition. ''you are dead, you are indispose from inside.'' from where you got these words? you know this man? this? who are they? Madav, in Himachal there is city Kalandi, in every 5 years fair occurred there he was the chief holy man there. and that's Cooper, near Kaland there is plant. he was one of the board of director. there are more people like that, and you have some connection with them. both of them committed suicide. but before dying they use to repeat that sentence. there family member were saying they just become like you. in first week horror voice and smell of burring. they were scare by there own face. they use to repeat ''you are dead, you are indispose from inside.'' etc.. and in the end they cut there hand. then write it on the wall with there own blood. and with the same weapon they cut there own throat. you have the same destiny. like they had. that day in the fashion show. you said the same sentence. you want to know why l am concern with these things? see that, l have made all this. at you house.. this. in fashion show, your yelling. l tried to stop all this but the truth is no one can stop it. not me nor anyone, and just like these painting became true. this one too. l have decided, that l should stay away from all this. this going to happen to me what happen to all of them? they use to repeat ''you are dead, you are indispose from inside.'' etc.. and in the end they cut there hand. then write it on the wall with there own blood. and with the same weapon they cut there own throat. but the truth is no one can stop it. Yash is calling you, you are not picking up? where are you? l got an important work, l need you Yard, and l am scared too. you always wanted this right.. you, me and house. happy married life. will you marry me? leave it, l will help you.

They've gone towards Kalindi. Someone saw them on National Highway. lf you want to go there, you should leave right now. There might be traffic jam on the way. Because of the fair. There's no other way. Everything will be finished. This earth will be vanished. By the morning all pilgrims will dive into the stream. Listen carefully... Nandita, one second. We are sinners. And the sin is the cause. We are the makers of this hell. Nobody will be able to see the sun tomorrow. Nobody will. The largest temple here belongs to your husband. Being a wife of a priest... you're spending life like this. My protitution earning is far better then the earning that my husband used to earn. Do you know why? Blood money. Money from the blood of innocent people. All those poor people, innocent people, they used to come with their problems to him. And he... He used to make more fools out of them. Give money. Do prayers, Pay money for rituals. Do this, do that, sacrifice this. God will be happy. He'll bless. l'm ready to do the dirty job. But l won't touch his money. Do l want to be doomed by touching his money? How did he die? How did this happen? What do you mean how did it happen? What happens when one drinks innocent blood? Won't you die like an animal? Die and rot. Tell me. How long one can survive on such filthy money? They did such thing. He and his partners. All of them died, one after one. Shall l tell you one thing? There's someone. Who's returned from dead. Whom these bastard are scared of. lt's their turn now. What's going on outside. ls not a fair. Animals died, human died, there were cremations. All of them will die. lnspector Amin will the first to go. Bastard! Where can we find Amin? How would l know? He might be at his home. l've heard he doesn't even go out. Not even on job. He doesn't meet anyone. How bad? When a dog sees his death it finds a corner to hide. That bastard dog is hiding in the corner. l was waiting for you Nandita. How do you know me? Do you want to kill me? Kill me. Stop Nandita. But l will find out. What have you done? What have you done alongwith Martha, Sheron and David? Tell me. Stop. What have you done that l'm being punished for? Don't shout bitch. This sin was started from you. You too tasted the bad crumb. Do you think you'll be spared? No You too will be suffered. You will die like us. Then tell me what have l done? Now tell it. This sin was started from you. You too will die like us. Don't look there. We will find some hospital. You'll be okay. Do me one last favor. Kill me. Bofore that l become like Amin, relieve me from this pain. Please kill me. Courage is required to live not to die. And you have that courage. l've seen that. There's no other way. There's no one who will help us. Who will tell us about this secret. Watch out. Prithvi, don't stop the car. What happened? Move. Nandita, what happened? - Move. What happened? Don't stop. - What are you saying? Don't stop. Stop Nandita. l've found out everything. He told me everything. Who did? He died right here. You father. Veer Pratab Singh. What? You're right sir, this water is contaminated. lt's written clearly in the lab report that his pesticide company's chemical is totally desolved in the water of the pond. lf the fair and his factory is not shut then... Then what? Veer Pratab Singh what? Now listen to my advice. Leave this town quietly. My men will escort you to the station. Go anywhere you like. Just leave this place. Or it will be very bad for you. Let Mr. David do his work. Go now. You are right. Tomorrow is a good day. All the prilgrims will be coming. Too see the ldols. The earning of town's poor poeple also depends on these pilgrims. And you are asking us to shut down the pond. lf the pond is shut, God will be angry as well as these poor people will loose their earning. Do you know the meaning to hindering in God's work? Well l guess we don't need these lab reports anymore. A God who doesn't have any mercy for his children. A religion which doesn't have any place for poor and oppressed. l refrain myself from such God and religion. From now on l will do whatever l feel right. Don't worry. God is with you. l know my life is in danger. These people want to kill me. You are my only hope. As soon as possible, we have to stop this fair. Thousands of lives are in danger. Please come. l'll be waiting. lf you hinder in God's work you will die here and rot in hell too. lt's you who's already rotten. You are polluted. lt would be better if you don't talk about good and bad to me. Tell it to yourself. God will never forgive you. l will come. l will come back. First he was screaming for help. Then for death. But when nobody came, he killed him here. lt happened to David and all what they did to your father. The pain he went through, he made them suffer with it. What he couldn't do in his life, he's trying to do it after his death. l always thought that my dad didn't care about me. But the truth is that l left him in his life and death all by himself. He was trying to tell me something. But l didn't hear him out. Thank you for everything. But l can't understand one thing. Why l'm here, l know that. But what's your connection with all this? Why did he make you suffer like that? Connection! That's what l need to find out. Without anyone's help. l must do this by myself. lt's good that we've come here. You know what Nandita. l'm sorry. l'm sorry. l think l never understood you. l told you before it's useless to come here this far. l had to drive 550 kilometers for nothing. Just for you. You haven't come here for me Yash. You've come here for those tapes. l know everything. He told me everything. We have to stop this fair as soon as possible. Thousands of lives are in danger. Please come. l'm waiting. - l'm coming. Don't throw me in the water. You guys have only two options. Either you shut down your pesticide plant. Then l'll forget if anything happened here. Or make a deal with me which l can't refuse. l'm already looking for sponsors for my show. You know what l mean. Sponsor my show. These tapes are yours. But l'm going to take this tape so you can't use it against me. And remember. You are now a party to this crime. lt's a deal. That's why l was so scared at this place. l couldn't stand here for a moment. lsn't it the place where you sold those tapes, your conscience? Why did you do all this? Why did l do all this? l did all this for you. Wasn't it you who said that l will be in loss if l get into emotions and human values? Do you remember something? Wasn't it you? Who said that if l go value the truth l won't get even a hut. That's why l hid the truth and sold it. For you, for myself. For my present and for my future. This sin was started from you. l don't want to be doomed by touching this money. Sell the truth and buy dreams. Everyone does that. What's wrong if we do this? You are right. He told me exactly the same. The filth is in me. The evil was inside me and l was looking for it here and there. lt's not your fault. The fault is all mine. Whatever you did, you did on my advice. To make my house... l ruined thousands of houses. l'm responsible for everything. lt all happened because of me. Believe me Nandita. Believe me. When they were killing him, l was standing there. And l didn't do anything. And l feel guilty for that. What's done is done. Forget it. Lets go. He isn't dead after dying. He's right here. Near us, with us. What do you want? What do you want? Where are those tapes? Where are those tapes? l have them. We have only four hours. Call your team here. What Veer Pratap couldn't do, we have to do that. He wants that. He wants to be heard. That's why he hasn't hurt you yet. He know that it's only you who can expose the truth. And save the lives of all those poeple. Please Yash. Stop this crime. There's no other way. Nandita, everything will be ruined. Everything. Please do it. Please Yash. Vishal! lt's me. l've got a great story. Come to Kalandi with all the team. As soon as possible. l'll bring the tapes. What are you trying to do? What are you doing? You think l'm stupid? Why didn't you make the call? What do you think l'll be scared with all your ghost stories? Give me the tapes. Why should l give you the tapes? l've trying to tell you to forget all this. l've been begging you but you're not listening. l won't let my career and my future get ruined. Enough. Not for this town, not for that Veer Pratab Singh, abnd not for you. After some time this fair will start and nobody can do anything. Forget this Nandita. You don't need all this. Forget it, plesae. l'm doing this for the benefit of both of us. Why do you want us to get ruined? All l want is for us to be happy. What have you been doing? Will you run away and tell the truth to the whole world? Too bad. This is the end of this secret. So is yours. l could have killed. l could have my revange as well. Because you killed my father. l might have had the satisfation that l did one of my duties. But the truth is had he wanted to kill you. He would have killed you like all the others. He didn't want that. He didn't want the revange, but only to reveal to truth to the people. That you had been hiding with you. That's all he wanted. That's all. You all are crazy. There's no power in this world other then humans. No God, no Devil, and no spirit. Just get it. Once anyone dies, he's dead. Nobody ever comes back, and nobody will ever come back. This is the end. Understand me? As you can see here. The largest pesticide plant has been shut down. lt made possible only by the report from our Zee News. With the toxics coming from the plant... The pesticide plant was shut down. lt was made restricted to dive in the pond by the pilgrims. We succeeded in saving so many lives. But this success gave us a lesson. And reminded us a saying of our wise ancestors. That we have to pay for the good and bad for others. The way my greed became someone else's pain. Great Poet Kabeer was right when he said: ''When l went to look for a bad person. '' ''l coulnd't find any bad person''. ''When l searched in my heart''. ''There was none bad but myself''.
