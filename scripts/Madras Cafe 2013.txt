'The killing was carried out using a human bomb.' 'According to the local police this incident took place..' '..when he was coming out of Colombo's Army Headquarters.' 'It is being alleged that the LTF could be behind this.' 'After this incident it is possible that peace attempts will get deferred.' 'And the situation there could get tense again.' Ruby. I want to say everything. The truth" I cannot carry.. "this burden anymore. You've been drinking again. I've told you. whatever is bothering you, share it You will feel lighter. Otherwise, go home. Betrayal". Power.. Greed.. Can I talk about such things before your God? Yes, You can. The last witness. They killed him as well. It was a game. A conspiracy. Who are you? It's been three years since you've been coming here... And What's this conspiracy that you are talking of? What wrong did our Prime Minister do? Why did we let him die? What? We could've saved our prime minister. What do you know? 'I was there, Father.' 'It was the darkest phase in the history of Sri Lanka.' 'The clashes between the largest ethic group Sinhalese.' '..and the minority Tamils.. ...had was going through its worst crisis.' 'This ethic violence claimed thousands of Tamilian civilian lives...' Abuses.. 'The supply of basic necessities like food..' 'Water..' 'Everything was stopped.' 'A lot of families were destroyed.' 'And thus thousands of Tamilian youth turned rebellious..' 'And joined the LTF leader Anna.' Long Live Eelam Long Live Eelam 'Anna refused to surrender before the Sri Lankan forces.' 'And raised the demand for a separate Tamil state.' 'And thus began, the endless killings.' 'These bloodbath made many Tamils lose their homes.' 'And they sought refuge in India.' 'Indian government expressed its concern.. ...and decided to intervene.' Peace Accord is an important political decision. I will be going ahead with it. We will be signing the Peace Accord tomorrow. To make sure that no inhumane activity takes place.. ..during the Provincial Council Elections. "I've decided to send a peace force to the island. 'Prime Minister signed the historical Peace Accord". ...with the Sri Lankan President today.' 'He also declared the Provincial Council Elections..' 'So that once again there is peace and normalcy in the island.' 'The first group of the peace force.. ' '..reached there with an intention of making the rebels surrender arms.' 'In the hope that peace and normalcy returns.' 'But Anna rejected the Peace Accord.' '19 LTF cadres committed suicide in Sri Lankan custody.' 'And Anna blamed lndia.. ...and Sri Lanka for it.' 'He said that this peace accord is not in the favor of the Tamils.' 'He feared that if they surrendered arms..' '..then once the peace force leaves.' '..all the Tamils in the island will be killed.' 'Hence.. 'He was not ready to negotiate.' This is going to be a long war. 'Indian Army launched an operation to capture Anna.' 'But our soldiers got killed . ' ' since Anna was already in the know of.. ..our operational details and intels 'And from here on, began a gruesome guerilla war..' '..between Anna and the peace force.' Our soldiers are getting killed. Operation details are getting leaked. RD, I hope you are aware of what your boys are up to. But we had warned you, not to send the forces. But it was your General who assured the PM.. ..that we'll disarm them in 72 hours. And here we are, after one year. If this continues, we're sure to get embarrassed. PM needs is answerable to the people. Mr. Cabinet Secretary, we are not fighting with a traditional army. This is a locally entrenched guerilla force. We just can't make out who's a militant and who's a civilian! We don't even have proper maps! But yes, if they attack us, we will retaliate. This shouldn't become another Vietnam for us. How much more can we embarrass the PM? RD? The fact is, Anna doesn't trust us anymore. And Perhaps we ourselves are responsible for creating this situation If we loosen the grip any further" ..it will be a golden opportunity for the west to get inside the island. And this is already happening Guruji all of a sudden going to Singapore.. ..with Murthy for a spiritual tour.. ls it a coincidence? So, Mr. Murthy, ..you wish to be the lord of the largest democracy? I've always been saying.. ..that there's a conspiracy to overthrow the government. One thing is clear now. Only military action won't suffice. All these are clear cut signs. Overt operations won't be enough now. RD, get all the covert ops ready. This Peace Accord needs to succeed, at any cost. That's all. Good luck. RD.. Stay. Enough of these discussions. Media is asking a lot of questions. You'll have to intervene. I'm ready.. ..to use all the intelligence at my disposal. But who are we really fighting? You, too, need to understand. The situation is very sensitive. Anna won't surrender arms. He is adamant. And others are waiting to jump in to win his trust. We will lose the island. And that will be a serious national threat for us. Now is not the time to go by the book. The time to question" ..what is legitimate and what is not, is over. You know very well what needs to be done with Anna. Send in your best men. We need to form a Provincial Council there, before Diwali. Swarup, get me Major Vikram. I want him in Delhi in the next 24 hours. Urgent. Ruby, I need to go. Otherwise, you know.. - Look, I know, I am an army wife. And I need to hold my head high and all that. And I will. But it's been four years. And I just keep missing you. How do I stay normal? Don't worry. Everything will be normal soon. Oh yes, and avoid all these news. And take care of yourself. If you are so concerned about me then don't go. Six months, at least. Till I hold you again, like this. So, what's happening? Bala has been informed. Jaffna safe house has been activated. Vikram.. Still as restless as ever? Old habits die hard, sir. Relax. Swaru p. Additional director. Of course, I remember, sir. I had met you briefly during the Mizoram operation. Good memory. Sir. Anyway, talking about work.. Do you know anything about lndo-Lankan situation? I've done my homework, sir. You know nothing. You'll be solely responsible for all covert operations of RAW in Jaffna. Sir. PM is concerned about the situation there. His clear agenda is to execute Provincial Elections successfully The Small militant groups there have surrendered. But The most powerful group, the most ferocious one, LTF.. is still resistant. Do we have a strategy, sir? Step one: Break LTF. The most likely candidate for that: Mallaya. He's Anna's Man Friday. Very loyal. Impossible to reach. Step Two: Shri. He's the only man in the island who can stand against Anna. Get him on our side. For official matters you'll report to the Madras Desk Head, Bala. He's tough but knows a lot about Jaffna. But you'll report to me personally, about everything. Keep me in the loop. -Yes, sir. Any questions? - No, sir. Welcome aboard. Come, Swaroop. Jaffn a? But isn't a civil war going on there, Vi? Don't worry. I'm leaving behind a contact - Swarup's. Call him in case of any emergency. 'Indian Prime Minister today has categorically". ..stated that the peace forces..' '..will not be withdrawn until the elections are successfully held.' 'And that India won't allow any foreign powers.. ...to interfere in her regional matters.' Hi. Vikram. J aya. Pleasure meeting you. ls this Your normal route? I'm writing a piece on the refugees. You? Chibber route. Do you still operate out of London? No, here for some time now. I've read your articles. You are quite critical. Criticizing our national policies.. "doesn't make me anti national. Not at all. It's the birth right of all you journalists. Whatever you print, it becomes a bestseller. You think you're more patriotic? Of course. Those with passports, proceed to the passport division. Those without passport, please register at the army camp. 'Men, stay at the back.' 'No matter between whom the conflict is..' 'No matter what the reason is..' 'The first casualties are always the Innocent civilians.' 'And This was happening in Sri Lanka as well.' 'There was devastation everywhere.' I've an authorized visa. - Sorry, ma'am. I'm allowed to pass through. - I'm sorry. What are you saying? I'm here. I'm ajournalist. - Sorry, ma'am. What do you mean? I have to get through. Welcome to the land of Buddha, sir. KT. Kamal Tyagi. Jaffna safe house is 118kms away. Passport? ID? 'How could humanity ever survive in all of this?' 'In this small island..' 'Civilization was dying.' This way sir. This is our safe house. Inform the high commission. - Yes. Myself Sushil Pandey. SP. Hi, SP. Intercepts? - Yes, sir. Call records for the past two days and intercepts. Sir. - Hello, boys. Sir! - Sir, Major Vikram reporting. I've heard about you. Try this. A local drink. - Sir. LTF. Most dedicated and disciplined. They operate from deep within the jungle, from bunkers.. ...40 feet underground. Hence, this map. Memorize it. Relax. We'll be running our phase two covert operations. We need to weaken LTF's top leaders. Dead or alive. LFT. Liberations of Tamils Front, also known as Tigers. The top leader: Pandyan, Intel chief. Mallaya, deputy leader and army commander. Rajsekharan, their spokesperson, an arms dealer. But our hero, Anna Baskaran. He doesn't need an intro. On the other hand, TPA. Chief, Shri. Once upon a time he was Anna's partner. He's soft. Wants to get into politics. Prime Minister wants that Anna should surrender arms.. ..and join the elections before Diwali. Make Shri powerful. Make them fight each other. Do we this all by ourselves? Obviously. You are not in the army anymore. You are an agent of R&AW. Hence use less brawn and more brains. You'll report everything to me. I'll find out what I need to through my own means. I cannot afford mistakes. Sir. And most importantly, you are a team leader. So don't get caught. Never get caught. 'My primary task for the next few days..' Turn left. '..Was to find Shree.' We identified a few important links. 'We got a breakthrough when Narayanan agreed to meet us.' Hello, sir. I got through Narayanan. He's agreed to meet. Tomorrow, 7:00am. 7kms from safe house. Sir, the one in white shirt. This basket. - How much does it weigh? - 30 kgs. And This is for? - Local market. 70% of the earth is covered with water. It's not so difficult to catch fish. Oh really? That really depends on the fish. The deeper you go the better fish you catch. Tell me, which one do you want? My bosses love the fish you catch for them. Which one do you want? I told you this one belongs to the local market. Tell me which one do you want? CIA, KGB, Tigers. They're All the same for me. I don't have time to waste. Don't even try to negotiate. Shri You an agent? Everyone is the same in a war zone. Maybe. But for me, no satisfaction means no fish. You see this Information business has become too risky& I'll have to give information about you if anyone enquires. I need to store that. Now you may Leave. SfOP Go. How will you and your government support me? The situation out here.. How will people sitting in New Delhi control it? New Delhi recognizes your TPA. And our PM's agenda is exactly to settle that. Election and peace. Peace? Anna has made me his archrival. We were like brothers. He's being brutal to our people. He wants total control over Jaffna. People want to see one leader. Come to the point. Sir, we want you to counter LTF. We need loads of arms to counter Anna. Loads of them. Can your bosses provide me with arms? Will they promise? Can you? Sir, we'll support you in this war. We're with you. Wait, M r. Vi kram. I hate liars. You won't get a second chance. Remember that. You need to relax, boss. Shri neither trusts me, nor you. I'm just waiting for the right time. He won't agree on anything until he gets the arms. Please understand, boss. Who are you working for? For Shri? Or for me? Sir, I'll handle this my way. Trust me. Please, sir. Keep me informed. Down.. down.. Welcome, madam. This way. So, you did meet with the Prime Minister. He offered you the support what you were seeking. But then you backed off. My soldiers surrendered their arms. They were killed. I was backstabbed. I want safety for my people. What happens when the peace forces leave? Look, it's a clear order for the peace forces.. ..to ensure that the elections go peacefully. But you're also hell bent on boycotting these elections. By teaming up with Shri? Double standard. I'm already an elected leader. I've a legitimate army. Attention! So this bloodbath, there's no end to it? I did not start it. Salute! Then if you don't agree for a political solution" "you'll have to find a new partner. ls there a new alliance? This is my land. ELAM is my final destination. For that if I need to seek help from the west" "then I will. LTF's leader Anna has once again rejected" ..|ndia's offer for peace elections. And has further stated that. ..he will not hesitate to seek help from the west. How does New Delhi react to this? How will this affect the peace process in the island? Only time will tell. Rajsekharan, you source funds and arms from outside. Go and meet our new foreign friend. We need.. "Your help in our fight, in our war. So you need our support? We need to be assured of your support in the future. I have to pass through. There could be An ambush ma'am. Rounds are being fired inside. I can't allow you to go in. Look, I've the colonel's permission. I've received no such orders. - Ma'am.. I have to pass through. - Captain. I know her. Not bad. Thank you. I read your interview. How's Anna? Hey, listen, he's not my friend. But I will say this. I've never met anyone with so much clarity and purpose. You can't buy him. Then Anna must've also told you about his new partner. You're asking me? Until last year LTF was favored by New Delhi. But now, their rival TPA Shri seems to have taken their place. I don't know what you're talking about. Somebody has got to be helping them. Why tell me? It's your job, isn't it? "The date for arms deal was decided as 6th July. 'It was important that the arms consignment reached Shri.' Hello. Capt. Murli. Delivery will be made from Singapore. From here. By using fishing boats, we'll make the exchange. And this here, is the dropping point. Point Pedro. Delivery at 4:00pm. - 'But I didn't know that..' 'This small arms deal will change both the local politics..' '..and my life forever.' Gifts are on the way from Singapore. Be sure they reach our new friends. Don't worry, Reed. My man will be there with our new friends. Vikram, you will get a safe passage from the old ship yard. Sri Lankan army's Capt. Ratnayake will be waiting for you. Just pay him the money Landing will happen at: Point Pedro. Indians are on their way. Leave now. Okay. Over and out. Let's go. Let's go. Common hurry Let's move. Move move, Fast What are LTF rebels doing here, sir? KT, something is wrong. - Let me check. KT! take position KT! SP! SP, KT is hit! Send backup! Lets go, lets go Get up, KT! Get up! Attention! Anna these are rocket launchers, and these are AK-47 & AK-56 Hello? I'm KT's senior calling from Jaffna. KT is.. Please, ma'am. We did all we could do. Sir. Happy? We lost an important man Out! Get out! What had I asked you? If you can't handle it by yourself I can help.. Did I or did I not say that? What now? A marching PKITY? Sir, someone double-crossed us. Don't give me that bullshit! Vikram, you know what your problem is, you think you're too smart! Sir. Trust me, sir. LTF was not supposed to be there. I don't know from where the random firing started. Do you know what be the result of this? Anna and Shri, both of them will hunt us down. Hello? Sir.. What! RD sir is on the line. Sure, sir. I will take control. Yes. Now you get out of Jaffna. Go straight to the Colombo safe house. And stay there. Delhi still hasn't altered its ways. The same old strategy. It's not so. We want to support you. You gave such a big arms consignment to LTF. This is how you'll support us! There was an ambush. I too lost a man. The other guy, Vikram, he came here and made big promises. Do you know why he is still alive? I told my men that he's your man. It was a mistake Bullshit, This is how I'll counter Anna? I'll handle him personally. 24 hours. Deal with him. If you don't then I will. He's gone to Capt. Mur|i's shop. What happened at the jetty? I don't know. Who informed LTF? I don't know. I really don't know. No one knew about the arms deal. How did they find out about it? I don't know, please, sir. For God's sake. I don't know, sir. Right, sir. Keep him alive" don't kill him Jaya, the journalist's room number please. J aya. Jaya, it's me. I need to talk to you. Anna would get the arms. You knew about it, didn't you? ls this an official interrogation, Mr. RAW? Because if it is, my answer is no. How did you know? I need to know. Excuse me? Why are you asking me this? I have my networks. That's my job. You should know how it works. Jaya, please. if Anna is being made more powerful There will be repercussions. The entire peace process will fail. There will be a whole new civil war. Goddamn it. This is not a game. Vikram, look around. The peace process has already failed. And I'm not playing games either. I'm here because there human lives are at stake. Jaya, please. What do you know? Look, before I came here I got a call from my source. A foreign agency guy met with an Indian official. And the leak happened in Bangkok Was that Indian official from RAW? I don't know. Look, if he was Raw then you know.. Let me tell you, they know your next move much before you even implement it. So you should know about it, not me. Vikram. this conversation never happened. Assets can't call be called back. Specially considering.. Sir, there's some urgent news. Please have a look at it. 'Latest news has just come in from Sri Lanka that an Indian national..' '..Vikram Singh has been abducted by the LTF militants..' '..in the Jaffna area.' Stay down, stay down.. 'The Indian High Commission in Colombo has stated..' '..they are not aware of the whereabouts of Vikram.' This kidnapping is assumed to be a political kidnapping. How unstable will the conditions be? Or Will the Indian High... Get me Bah: now. Ma'am, we understand this is not easy for you. But this is a political kidnapping. We are negotiating. But we can approach the Indian High Commission, right? They can send in the army. After all the army is responsible, right? Vikram was on official duty. He was on official posting. Ma'am, we need to understand whom we are dealing with. A dangerous and brutal terrorist outfit, LTF. Perhaps even you know about them. So you mean I should keep mum.. ..and my husband's life hangs in the bargain. Right? Ma'am, we understand your emotions. But Vikram belongs to us. We will try our best and bring him back safely. Hello. - What the hell is happening, Bala? I don't know, sir. I just returned to Madras this morning. Our best boy gets kidnapped right from under your nose.. And you're say that you don't know! I understand, sir. You are responsible for whatever happens there. I had warned Vikram. I told him to be careful. And now LTF is angry.. If LTF is responsible then talk to them. Deploy the army if you have to. Do what you have to but we want our boy back safely. Sir, I spoke to the High Commission in Colombo. You know they won't negotiate. Fine, sir. I'll leave right away. I'll leave for the army base camp right away. Soldier's name: Vikram Singh. Suspected location: Pallai town. 48kms east from Jaffna. Bravo one. Around 50 LTF holding up there. Ask LTF to leave right now.. I have deployed the army. Target visible. 60 degrees north. Sir, He's alive. Bravo one to base camp. Location is empty. Repeat. Location is empty. Status: Injured but alive. Here have this you'll feel better. How do you feel? Look at your self Your New Delhi thinks that it can sit there.. ..and manage everything through a remote control. Nonsense! In the field, in the jungle.. I'm in control here. Jaffna is my territory. You wouldn't have survived. I saved you. What next? Oh, your work is done. Your assignment's finished. Your cover is blown. You are on the hit-list of both the camps. You'll put the agency in risk if you stay here. So, you should leave. Enjoy with your wife. Go on a holiday. And one more thing, yourjournalist friend she should leave too. It's not safe for her here. SP. Here Will you help me? Yes, boss? Henceforth I want all the information of Ba|a's movements and call records. Okay, boss. How are you? I'm fine. And your injury? 'Ruby. The one whom I always left back alone.' 'She just had only this one hope.' 'That everything will be fine.' 'I might have been the one at war, but she too was fighting a battle.' 'With herself. ' 'With her fears. ' 'I had the entire army with me.' But all she had was her belief..' 'That I will come back.' 'Alive. ' How are you? Alive, for now. You wouldn't have survived this time. LTF was very rigid. And New Delhi, you know them well. Somehow we managed. But, sir, I got framed. Twice. Somehow survived. So, what went wrong? What do you think? Sir, I was not wrong about the arms deal. There is a leak amongst us. So what's your plan? Thank you, sir. That I need to figure out. But before that, I'll get you Mallaya. You were right. To pin down Anna, we need to crack Mallaya. H ow? You can't go back in the jungle. They'll kill you. Sir, with your permission, let me do it. Off the record. You mean no vacation? I want Mallaya. Mallaya is the most dangerous shark. You're taking a big risk. You'll get both of us killed. Fine, I'll see what I can do. Double money. Mallaya was Anna's second in command Who controlled the entire east region And getting him onto our side for the elections... ...meant breking the ITF into 2 I want to meet Mallaya. Who are you? Where are you from? I'm a reporter. Why do you want to meet Mallaya? I'm reporting on the war. Myself Vikram, sir. So you.. "want to interview me? Yes. I was waiting for you. You know why? For what purpose would a RAW's journalist. "out his life at risk and come here? Mr. Mallaya, let me get straight to the point. My senior wants to meet you. In Colombo. RD is coming to Colombo? You know Anna will be very angry. He wants to meet you, alone. First you spoke about breaking the LTF. Then you prepared TPA against them. Now you want us to support the LTF again? I think we should go ahead with the Provincial Council Elections. Pick any three representatives. Go ahead with the elections and end this. Any meaning? The ones no one knows about? No one recognizes? If we want peace... we need the people with us. And we all know that people support LTF. We will have to partner LTF. And I don't mean Anna. We partner LTF without Anna. We have been able to penetrate to his second in command, Mallaya. He has enough backing of LTF that he can stand on his own. As a leader. - Now who the hell is Mallaya, RD? Hold on. If we can still have the elections then.. ..we might find a face saving exit. Otherwise, in the next 48 hours the PM will have to resign. Sir. Try. So...You went passed me? Good You met Mallaya. How did you manage that? I was just following orders, sir. Oh, come on! Don't give me that bullshit. Conspiring with New Delhi, that's what you are doing. There is a leak in my team" You. We both are working for the same government. You cannot keep implicating me. If you do that again, I will not hold back. And you know, no one is innocent here. Hi, Jaya. Hi. So you're leaving? Obviously. They think I work for you now. But thanks for saving my life. Look, I'm sorry that because of me.. - Please. Don't drag me into this any further. As a war correspondent it's important that I'd be seen as unbiased. It could ruin everything that I stand for. I just wanted you to know that you are not safe here. Yeah, I know. These threats. Anyway, don't worry. I promise to remain anti-national. My office numbers and my London's personal number. And, Vikram, be safe. You too. Please have your tea. I don't enjoy such things. I stay in the jungle. That's why Anna operates like a tyrant? He's openly into brutality. But it won't last for long. No matter where Anna is hiding in this island, we will find him. And the elections will be held peacefully. But what after that? Who will be the new leader? Have you ever given that a thought? It was a mistake coming here. The mistake is that you guys are addicted to war. hanging cyanide capsules around the neck of small children, making them into turn militants... ls this your war? You are snatching away their future. The Tamilians can get their rights back.. "Only through a political solution. And you can do so, by being their leader. Not through war. Our offer is clear. And what if I refuse? You have no option. Enjoy your tea. Vikram, phase three. Get Anna. - Sir. Mallaya will give you Anna's location. Brief the army special forces. We want Anna at any cost. Right, sir. Mission Extract Anna. Two platoons. One will land in the east and the other in north. Vikram.. This is the position of the LTF camp. 500 meters in diameter. The whole region is covered with landmines. This will be our dropping point. Pottai lake. Remember, we have only eight minutes. Vikram, your job in Jaffna is over for the time being. Immediately station yourself in Kerala. Wait for further orders. Leave now. He's not here.. its empty Target locked. Cover up! Cover up! Come on! Fast... Anna.. southern side.. in the bunker.. this way. 'I survived.' 'I came back to India.' 'But my job was still incomplete.' 'Bala. I knew he was the leak.' But I needed concrete evidence. What happened, Vikram? Those faces, those killings.. Something doesn't seem right, Ruby. Just let go. 'As per the latest news received LTF leader Anna is dead.' 'The news of Anna's death spread like wild fire.' 'The whole island was in shock.' 'The whole world believed us.' 'And we too, believed that ourjob was done.' Long live Mallaya! Our leader Mallaya. 'Mallaya declared himself as the new leader of LTF.' 'But..' 'An na was alive. ' Why did you do this? No one can betray our ELAM. 'And now, it was impossible to stop Anna.' 'He became the undisputed leader of North-East Sri Lanka.' 'And now much more ferocious.' 'Prime Minister has resigned today.' 'Due to an unexpected development this morning..' '..he took this step under political pressure.' 'Because of the change in the political scenario... ...in Delhi, PM resigned.' 'A week after the new government came into power..' '..our army was called back from Lanka.' 'This was a victory for Anna,' 'against the world's fourth largest military force.' From here on began the grand conspiracy. The final assassination plot. So, is this the reason why we lost our Prime Minister? Fresh elections were announced a year after his resignation. 'During the election campaign,' 'at a press conference..' '..ex-prime minister...' '..announced his political agenda for the next elections.' Tamil cause be an important issue for you this time as well? If we do come into power, apart from economic growth" ...Tamil cause will be an important issue for me. That there is Peace in the island. That the Tamilians should get their rights. This is what we will aim for. 'Peace in the island.' 'Tamilians should get their rights.' 'This is what we will aim for.' 'My stand is clear. I want a peaceful political solution.' 'A month after this speech, 'our Madras Desk and South-East Naval force..' intercepted some coded messages. ' Reed, the meeting is fixed. 'And perhaps from here on that the grand conspiracy began took shape.' Guruji... We need to act and this is the perfect time. You fix up the meeting. You just wait there. I'll tell you what. Okay. SpeakYa... What is it? Sir, these are the Intercepts of last few days. I've collected some from the Naval intelligence. Sir, since From the past few days this the wireless chatter" "between London, Jaffna and Singapore has seems to have increased, sir. Yes, it's okay. It's routine. You may leave. No, sir. One of the speakers voices is that of Anna's. Look, I'll see look into what's important or what's not, in it. But doesn't this sound seem quite serious? Go. Leave. Listen, you're doing a good job. Keep me in the loop. Okay, sir. Hello? Hello? Vikram's residence, sir. The file is missing. Sir, spool.. Bloody hell.. They are both in Cochin. Send your men there. Hello? Hello? Hello? Hello, Ruby? Where are you, Vikram? Why? - These pictures and articles. Something is just not right. Whom do you work for? Listen, don't worry. I'm coming home. Don't open the door for anyone. Okay? Ruby! Ruby. Whom do you work for? We aren't safe here. In your absence our house is under surveillance in your absence. We're shifting to Delhi. - I'm being shadowed. Trust me, we have to move on. That's not the answer, Vikram. These pictures, these killings, these articles, the foreign journalist.. This is not army. You killed civilians? These killings are political killings. Jaya, she is a foreign journalist. Trust me, this is a setup. I can explain this.. - You jerk. All these days, you lied to me. Ruby, I do covert operations. I monitor political and military developments of different countries. This country's security is my responsibility. We have been married for three years. I know there is a responsibility. But there is a protocol. But I am not a.. I don't care about your protocol, alright! I'm your wife, damn it! I have a right to know. What about me.. How do I deal with all this? S Lanka. Your life was constantly under threat there. Do you have any idea how I survived? And today I got petrified, Vikram. - Sweetheart. Just leave me alone. Ru.. Ruby. Hello? - Boss, SP. I'm in Cochin. We should need to meet. It's urgent. Right away? - Sorry, sir. I don't have much time. We'll talk when we meet. At seven. Beach caf. Okay. Ruby.. - I know you have to go. Just go. Hello, boss. Something really seems to be out of order in Madras. A lot of intercepts and wireless messages are being exchanged. From Jaffna to London. Madras, Singapore. And One of the voices is that of speakers is Anna's. I've decoded some keywords. Like - Foreign friend. Negotiate. Middle-east. Does Bala know? Yes, I've shared them with him. But he asked me not to file or decode them. And His behavior has really scared me, boss. I feel you are not safe here either. What should I do next? Just stay safe. I'll see what I can do. Ruby. Ruby! Ruby! Ruby! Ruby! Why her? Why? Vikram.. I'm sorry. Your loss.. What should I say? Tough times. You know my wife and my children keep asking me: Why do you do this? There's a lot of danger. Your Life's always at risk. How do I explain to them that our country is surrounded by vultures? We need to protect it.... How much will they understand? That's why I don't say anything. Vikram, you need to bounce back. Anyway, you are not safe here. I'm not safe anywhere, sir. You cannot give up on the system so soon! System! We Which we know it inside out! I need you. We've got your intercepts. They are being decoded. And what you've said about Bala I hope you are right about Bala. God forbid if you are wrong, you'll be in great risk. It's a big accusation. I know, sir. I need to sort this out. If you don't start begin surveillance in the next 24 hours.. ..then I'll get the evidence myself. And I'll do it my way. Sir. We've got a fix on Vasu's location. He's constantly shifting his base. And But his last call was traced to old Delhi. Stop! Stop! Stop! Get down! Get down! - Get down! Bala recruited you for the agency from the Jammu district jail. Information was leaked from our system. They knew our operational details. What do you know? You'll have to speak up, Vasu. You know the consequences. I just photocopied the files. For whom? I don't know. My job was to drop them to at the airport. Bala sir's instructions. And Shree's Shri's arms deal? We lost a our man. You were there as well. Reverse the car Who informed the LTF? You? - I've told you. I just followed instructions. What happened that night? What happened on the night SP brought the intercepts, Vasu? That was the first time I saw Bala sir getting panicked. 'The file is missing!' He held me by my collar. He was very nervous. Why? Don't worry. Those intercepts are with me.' Your department is moving along.. A few of his intercepts were stolen. He doubted suspected SP. So he asked me to tail SP. And? He got a call from Singapore. From? - Some Reed. 'You just make sure those intercepts do not reach anyone.' I've never seen him. He used to call. 'A foreign agency guy met with an Indian official.' Did Bala know what did those intercepts contain? No. Those intercepts weren't decoded. Where is SP now? I don't know. Who sent you to Delhi? Bah: sir asked me to... ..disappear from Madras safe house after your incident. And Who gave the orders... ...to kill me and SP? Vasu.. While following orders from Bala did you ever realize.. ..that you'll be such a disgrace for the system? Such a shame. Hello? Yes, you want to speak to? Jaya Sah n I, please. Jaya Sahni? And you're calling from? - India. One moment please. I understand, ma. Don't worry. I'm fine. I'll call you back. Call from India. Hello? - Hi, Jaya. Hi. How are you? Jaya, I need your help. I told you, Vikram. I won't be able to help you. I can't give you my sources. All our intels have been leaked.. To this guy called Reed. So, it was one of your guys. - Yes. And he is a national threat. So what do you want from me? I need evidence. That's why, I need your sources. Okay. I'll call you back. Than ks, Jaya. And, Vikram, I'm really, really sorry about your wife. Thank you. Reed, you your man Bala is a risk for us. His cover is blown and he's being tracked. You want me to lose him? - Yes. Right. 'Okay, Vikram. Reach Bangkok.' 'Take Taxi No. 5892.' 'He will take you to Happyland fish market.' 'Ask for Shop No. 29.' 'My source will meet you there.' This way to shop no. 29 - That way So you are Vikram? And You need evidence? Yes. You are in the right direction. According to my source there is a tape and we'll get it by five. Since when have you been tracking Bala? Before and after I retired a lot of activity took place.. "between Madras, Jaffna and Singapore. I did some surveillance. I reported it as well. But I didn't have concrete evidence. When I found out that you're investigating the case, I agreed to meet you. Vikram, you are very close to reality. Who is Reed? - I don't know. It could be anyone. Maybe a faceless handler. Apart from there this... ...a lot of other activities took place that too raise arouse suspicion. Look at this. Rajsekharan at Madras Caf! Yes. The meeting took place in Singapore. Two meetings took place there. In the second meeting Rajsekharan was introduced. He was representing Anna. 'So you need our support?' It means that developments of... ...that meeting changed the whole politics. Yes. Do you remember the date of arms deal? 6th July. I was there. This meeting took place on the second2nd July. Exactly four days before the arms deal. 'Gifts are on the way from Singapore.' 'Be sure they reach our new friends.' 'Don't worry, Reed. My man will be there.' That's why the arms which were meant to go to Shree.. ..and after those instructions, went to Anna. Right. 'Hey hurry up, common.. And perhaps Anna found a new partner. Who are these people? Corporations, big countries, big organizations. Who seek They need economic control, business deals, large arms contracts" And Their executors are ex-agency employees. They are called economic hitmen. Who are these people? Where do they meet? No one knows. Remember, Vikram, India is the fastest growing market. India is the future. That's why an attempt there is to... ...pressurpressurize her e from everywhere all corners. This is the modern day warfare. That's why Trincomalee dock. This Lankan coastline is so strategic for everyone. Yes. And that's why they are supporting Anna... ...if Anna comes to power... ...then they will gain control... ...over entire South East Asia via Trincomalee Dock ...and that would a national threat for India That's the reason why ex-PM is not so popular with them. He doesn't want war. He wants a peaceful political solution. And that's why Anna. Anna is an idealist. And He'll he will continue the war till he doesn't get freedom. And they will exploit this. Wait here. - Okay. Package please. Your evidence. Let's go. Nasal. - Nasal. llpa- Pal Ant. What have we got? They are possibly discussing an assassination of a national leader. Sir, the intercepts. Two of them have been decoded. Have you informed RD? Not yet, sir. I was waiting for you. Bala? So they trapped him. Honeytrap. Oldest trick of the intel world. l, too, doubted Had my doubts about him but this.. So they exposed Bah;. Perhaps Bala had become useless for them. The And they either eliminate or expose the useless. This is how our world works. This better be good. This is serious, sir. The intercepts we got from Vikram have been decoded. You better see it. Sir, that's Anna's voice. It originated from his camp. The words, sir. Garland. Important. Leader. They are going for the ex-prime minister. Get me Vikram. ASAP. Sir, there's one more thing.

It depends on where you are choose to stand. Remember, my friend. This meeting never happened. Bala, your tape has been released, you must leave now.. Sir, I have evidence. He was honey-trapped. He compromised everything. I believe they blackmailed him. Yes, Vikram. We, too, know about his secret bank accounts. ..fake passports and travel details. He didn't just sell us out. He sold out the entire country. Now you let the department handle him. But you Come back here immediately. The intercepts between Jaffna and Madras have been decoded. There's There is a plot to assassinate the ex-PM. This is a serious threat and we need to move fast. You are drinking too much. Are you okay? You Go to sleep. Don't worry about me. Bah;. Why did you do this? Why? And my wife? What was her fault? It wasn't her fault. That was a mistake. You were the target, but you survived. You're lucky. And the second arms deal? My kidnapping? You were behind it, Bala? I have information that two meetings took place in Singapore. Where Rajsekharan represented Anna. It's obviously a well-designed plan. Here's a copy of decoded intercepts for you. We've very little time. Brief your best team. Find out, where is it this going to take place, who all are involved? Who? How? What? When? Where? I need all the information. And Vikram.. - Sir. He is no longer the prime minister. He's out of power. It won't be so easy to operate. Keep that in mind. We need solid evidence.

Where are they? I don't know. They Left from the camp. Did they tell you who the target is? I don't know, sir. Sir! -You are lying. They will kill me. You said you would save me. He says LTF will kill him. Sir, save me sir.. How many people does each hit squad contain? Each contains 4 or 5 people. 6-7 different teams. They left Jaffna a week back. Where to? We don't know. Multiple cities. But one team has definitely landed in Tamil Nadu. Okay, sir. - 'He has started south election campaign for South from today.' 'And he said that Tamil cause will be his priority.'

Four days back, this amount was transferred into the LTF account. This means this is the final confirmation? For any job, money is the final confirmation. Where did you get this from? I was investigating these banks. And realized such banks only exist on paper. They remain for a few days, months and then, they just disappear. So, first the speech by the ex-PM. Then Rajsekharan goes to Madras Caf, London. And that's where possibly things happened. 'Anna, he's coming back to power.' 'He will not let us do what we want.' 'He'll demand a political solution.'

They are innocent. What about the people who live here? What about them? Whom did you supply the explosives to? I was hired. I was told I'll be paid well, sir. I'm not a terrorist, sir.

That's all, sir. What did you assemble? Plastic explosives. First time in the world. High quality explosives. Rubber like material. Advantage is that the metal detectives can't detect it. And kills it can kill everyone anyone in the radius of 20-30 feet. Where are they taking it? How will they use it? - I don't know, sir. It can happen anywhere Delhi, Bombay, Madras. Anywhere.

We'll have to stop him. - Sir. Get me Hyderabad airport. - Sir. All our intels are clearing stating that LTF will target the ex-PM. We've strong evidence. First back switch, then front switch. First back switch, then front switch. Once more. State governor went against protocol and warned him. That he shouldn't tour south. No, I don't think LTF will plan something this big. No. First back switch, then front switch. We'll have to provide him with full protection, at all cost. Ex-PM or ex-minister, we cannot provide NSG to anyone. It is against the rules! We cannot do it! But if you insist, keeping in mind the threat. ...we'll inform the state police. They will look after it. Fine. Whatever you deem fit. Ghosh.. - Sir. Get me special access. I'm about to reach the airport. Now. - Okay, sir. Good afternoon, sir. Robin Dutt. I've a request to make, sir. Kindly cancel your rallies for today and for the next 2-3 days. There's a threat. It will be better if you avoid them. You know I want to be with the people for these elections. There is security over there. Yes, sir. It's there. But it could be dangerous. It's a request.

Everyone please co-operate for the security check... Please move behind from the stage... Ladies who will be garlanding, please move to the front row Please maintain discipline... ...our leader will be reaching in the next minutes Sir, here's the route map. Rishi is already there. Okay. Vikram has reached. He's on his way to the rally. All units informed. Routine scanning is complete, sir. Around 3000-3500 people. He'll be here soon. Keep checking, I'm coming. - Yes, sir. Ex-PM has reached. You're not allowed to go ahead! 'We're sorry to inform you that earlier tonight..' '..lndia's former Prime Minister was assassinated.' 'This dreadful blast took place at 10:10pm.' 'He was in Poothiyaddur district in South India, to address an election rally.' 'In the south of India, this sudden and tragic death..' '..has left the whole nation in a state of shock.' 'This is the first time a human bomb has been used...' 'His unfortunate death has left people in a state of shock.' 'The whole nation is mourning.' 'So far this blast has claimed 25 people's lives, and injured more than 100 people.' 'A horrific blast took place at 10:10pm.' 'This shocking incident has sent shock waves across the entire nation.' 'Bringing the country to a complete standstill.' 'The special investigation squad has revealed..' '..the use of plastic explosives and RDX.' 'So far this blast has claimed 25 people's lives, and injured more than 100 people.' They were those who came to the rally... ..to support our former prime minister. Just like that. What was his fault? He was so young. We tried. But we lost. - 'President has requested people to stay calm.' 'Leaders all across the world have expressed their condolences.' 'After some time..' - Let's go! Let's go! Let's go! 'The investigation team arrested a few suspects.' 'And a few suspects committed suicide before they could be arrested.' 'And I submitted my report to the special investigation team.' This commission appreciates your investigations. And yes, we will consider them. But, Mr. Vikram, we need solid evidence. 'I'd never realized that... ...the world is so threatened by our Prime Minister.' 'RD sir resigned after a few days.' I hope you've given this decision of yours a thought. Yes. And I took a voluntary retirement and came here. Whatever you just said could also be just a coincidence. No, Father. This conspiracy was played out just as it was planned. And I was late. But I couldn't compete with him. They were powerful. And In this game we lost our Prime Minister. And the Lankan Tamils - their future. Then who won? I don't know. Perhaps it was everyone's loss. And Anna? One man's revolutionary is another man's terrorist. Anna is revolutionary for his people. But I lost my Prime Minister. What will you do now? Ruby's father gave this to me... ...on our wedding day. A wedding gift. Where the mind is without fear and the head is held high.. Where knowledge is free.. Where the world has not been broken up into fragments. By narrow domestic walls.. Where words come out from the depth of truth" Where tireless striving stretches its arms towards perfection.. Where the clear stream of reason has not lost its way.. Into the dreary desert sand of dead habit. Where the mind is led forward by thee.. Into every-widening thought and action" Into that heaven of freedom, my Father, let my country awake.. Thank you.
