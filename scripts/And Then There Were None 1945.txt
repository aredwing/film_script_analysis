I think I'd better introduce myself I am Vera Claythorne. Mrs. Owen's new secretary. My name is Emily Brent. Is there anyting you want, Miss? I would like to see Mrs. Owen. I'm Mrs. Owen's new secretary. I expect you know that. No, Miss, I don't know anything. Just the list of the gentlemen and the ladies who are invited for the weekend. Didn't Mrs. Owen mention me? I haven't seen Mrs. Owen yet. We only came here a few days ago. This is a large house. What staff have you here? Just me and Rogers, Miss. - Does Mr Owen know we have arrived? - He is not here yet, Sir. -- And where is Mrs Owen? - She was delayed in London. I got a letter. They'll be here for dinner, eight o'clock, sir. We tell the story, in Ireland, about the 2 Englishmen ... ... who was cast away in an uninhabited island for 3 years. and never spoke to each other because they had not been introduced. I'm not English! My name is Prince Nikita Starloff. Call me Nicky. Well, that breaks the ice, gentlemen. I am judge Quinncannon. How do you do, sir? I'm Dr. Armstrong. My name is Lombard. Philip Lombard. I am General Mandrake. - Sir John Mandrake, isn't it General? Some years ago, I was called in for consultation. Your wife was ill. My wife is dead! If you, gentlemen, would be good enough to follow me, I'll show you to your rooms. - I'm afraid I didn't catch your name. - Blore. -- Blore? - William Henry Blore. - Oh, Philip Lombard. -- I'm afraid you got the wrong bag! You are very observing, Mr Blore. C.M., Charles Morley, an old friend of mine. I like his taste. I even borrow his clothes. Oh, excuse me, doctor. I thought this was a closet. - it seems we are sharing the bathroom. - Oh, I did not know. The only time I was batchelor ... ... is when I get dressed for dinner. - Oh, let me help you. - Thank you. -- Do you know this part of the English coast? - No I can't care do. Something magical about the island. Yes, like a little world, that's all. How do you like spend last days here? No thanks, I think the weekend will be enough. We all build islands in imagination. represent the escape. Half of my patients are sick ... ... because the are trying to escape reality. -- And what is your answer? - Oh, I tell a fairytales. I build an island of imagined security. Don't you even give them medicine, doctor? Do you believe in justice, judge? -- Mr Blore? -- Yes? The bathroom is yours. -- Do you think they are done? - Done enough for them. Ethel. Don't stay there gowking, get it up. Did you wash the floor this morning? Do you suppose I have time for everything? It is not right to go inviting a house full of guests. I'll talk to Mr. Owen when he comes. You tell him we're quitting. The agency did not say a house was so big ... ... and so lonely. - You knew it was an island. - With only one house. I'm extremely nervous. Here! What they do not know won't hurt them. Never to pick a bird before it dies. Ladies and Gentlemen.., may I propose a toast ... ... to our gracious Hostess, Mrs. Owen. A, a, Doctor. I saw you! You drink water. That's bad luck. Water never hurts anyone, sir. Especially in my profession. Don't forget the old proverb, doctor. Never trust a man who does not drink. Sounds like the Bible. Great book. And now I'm giving to you, our charming host. Mr. Owen. Jolly good fellow! And I hope that would conclude all possible toasts. Tell me, Miss. Claythorne, Why did they call ... ... this place indian Island? I do not know. Excuse me, sir, the postman told me ... ... it has the shape of the head of an Indian. Oo, that accounts for little indians. -- Indians! We're not out of toasts, sir. I drink to the Indians. Each little indians, individually. 6, 7,8,9,10. Ten little indians. Ten little indians. So It is a nursery rhyme ... Ten little indian boys went out to dine ... one ... choked his little self and then there were nine. Poor old fellow, there is to hear. And what happened to the others? 9 little indian boys sat up very late one ... ... overslept himself and then there were 8. Then what happened? You will find the rhymes on the piano. Mr Owen seems to be fond of little Indians. TEN LITTLE INDIANS 8 little indian boys travelling in Devon, ... ... one said he'd stay there and then there were 7. 7 little indian boys chopping up sticks, one chopped himself in halves ... ... and then there were 6. 6 little indian boys playing with a hive, ... ... a bumblebee stung one and then there were 5. 5 little indian boys going in for law ... ... one got in chancery and then there were 4. 4 little indian boys going out to sea, ... ... a red herring swallowed one and then there were 3. 3 little indian boys walking in the zoo, ... ... a big bear hugged one and then there were 2. Plays for lunch, but t is the rhymes for a nursery. Don't worry, judge, he is down to the rest of indians. Two little indian boys sitting in the sun, one got for frizzled up ... ... and then there was one. One little indian boy left all alone, What a pity! So he went and hanged himself and then there were none. Silence please, ladies and gentlemen. this is your host Mr. Owen speaking. You were charged with the following crimes. General Sir John Mandrake: that you did deliberately sent your wife's lover, ... ... Lieutenant, Arthur Mansfield, to his death. Emily Brent: that you did cause and bring about the death of your young nephew, Peter Brent. Dr. Edward G. Armstrong: that through your uncontrolled drunkenness, ... You did kill ... Mrs. Mary Cleese. Prince Nikita Starloff: that you are guilty of the murder ... ...of Fred and Lucy Marlowe. Vera Claythorne: that you did murder your sister's fiance, ... ... Richard Bartley. Judge Francis J. Quinncannon: that you were responsible for the death ... ... by hanging of one Edward Seaton. Philip Lombard: that you are guilty of the death of 21 men ... ... members of the East African tribe. William H. Blore:that by perjuring your testimony, ... you did bring about the death of ... James Landor. Thomas and Ethel Rogers: that you brought about the death ... your invalid employer ... Mrs. Jennifer Brady. Prisoners at the bar of justice, ... ... have you anything to say in your defense? Silence please, ladies and gentlemen. This is your host Mr. O. .. What's going on here? What kind of a practical joke is this? It's on the record. Out with it fly. It is called swan song. May I ask who put this on the gramophone? - I did, sir. -- Why? I did not know what it was. I..! - I was just obeying orders, sir. That's all -- Whose orders? Mr. Owen's- Oh. - Let's get this quite clear. Mr. Owen's orders were what exactly? to put the record on it at 9 O'clock. It was sealed. I thought it was just a piece of music. It's the truth, sir! I have not seen Mr. Owen. I was telling my wife. I told you we did not come here! I want to get away! -- I won't touch that money! -- Shut up! First thing to do, Rogers, is to take your wife to bed. May I have your attention please. This letter ... ... to Rogers is signed by U. N. Owen. I must confess I do not know Mr. Owen personally. What kind of a man is he? Who knows him? We all come to a house we don't know the host! What about yourself, Your Highness? Oh, with me it is different. I am a professional guest. -- I wish we should never come here! -- Quiet, Ethel! I knew somebody was to find it out some day! -- I told you! -- Shut up, I tell you! She is quite out of nerve, doctor. Hysteria induced by shock. Give her a sedative. 10 drops in half a glass of water. Yes, sir. If she doesn't sleep, repeat the dose in 2 hours. I hope she'll sleep, doctor. Dr. Armstrong, we'll take an army evidence ... ... except your own. What is your reason for being here? Quite frankly, I came here professionally. I received a letter from Mr. Owen asking me ... ... to come here and spend a weekend, pretend to be a guest ... ... so that I'd examine his wife ... ... who had refused to see a doctor. I summarise our findings. We all received letters from old trusted friends ... inviting us to spend ... the weekend here ... ... as guests of their friends, Owens. Miss. Claythorne was employed to an agency ... ... and told to report to Mrs. Owen. This letter to Mr. Lombard is the only one directed ... ... to Mr. Owen. Very peculiar. I might even call it threatening. What do you say? I say ...that the only person's presence here ... ... hasn't been explained is that gentleman. Well, your honour, in a reason I can't conceal any longer. I am here to do a job. - I was hired. -- By whom? This man Owen. -- Did you see him? -No, here is the money order he sent ... ... for joining the party as one of the guests. I've a detective agency! Here I got my credentials! Look here, judge. All of the letters refer to our host ... ... as U.N. Owen. "U.N. Owen "! UN-kn-own Yes Mr. "Unknown" does not only. intend to see us under false pretences... but he is taking ... the trouble to find out the eight of us Listen, my friends, the accusation is true! Now I remember, a year ago ... ... two people in the road, ... ... I was driving fast, fast, fast! -- What happened? - They took my licence away. -- What about the two people? - I ran over them. Bad luck. I have still not guessed the purpose of Mr. Unknown host... ... getting us to assemble here. In my opinion, he is not of a normal mind. He may be dangerous. I think we should all leave immediately. I quite agree, sir. Rogers, how soon can we get the boat from England? I can not, sir. There is no telephone. The boat only comes twice a week. It won't come again until Monday. And this is only Friday. -- no boat here? No, sir. Why do we leave, my friends? Why not go to the bottom of this mystery? It's wonderful! At my time of life, I have no desire for "thrills", as you call them. Your legal mind has lost taste for adventure. I am all for crime, your honor. May I propose a toast: Here is to crime! Perfectly disgusting! Drinks like an animal. Huh? What did you say? - He is not moving. Just plain drunk. Just plain dead. -- What did the doctor say? - Dead. What? What are you looking at, Rogers? - It is broken, sir. It will have much to report the landlord. But Mr. Owen isn't the owner, sir. He's only leased it. Ah! Then you know more than you told us. Come, come, Rogers, I'm quite sure that there was no one else on this island? - I swear, sir. - I believe it, Rogers. But I am afraid your story will be questioned by the police . Do not touch! I thought you were gone to bed, Mr. Blore. In our profession, Doctor, we not only do what we appear to do. Perhaps it is the same in yours. Why do not you want me to touch that glass? I try to keep away your fingerprints on it. Smell it. Lethal solution. -- Suicide? That, I believe, comes in your profession, sir. Doctor! Doctor Armstrong! -- What's it, Rogers? --It's my wife, sir. She does not look fine! Go ahead and I'll follow you! Good morning, Miss. Brent. I hope you slept better than I did. I slept very well, thank you. I have nothing on my conscience. Good morning, General. Good morning. General Mandrake! Yes, Juliet? Oh! Forgive me, young lady. I was thinking of my wife. Good morning, Miss. Claythorne. What about breakfast? Do you mind if I sit down like this? Good morning, judge. Good morning, Miss. Brent. -- Why, something worrying you? - I do not understand it. -- I don't think I don't understand, Sir! - Take a look at the figures. -- How many were there last night? Ten. Rogers found one broken after what happened. - And now, how many do you see? - Eight. Only eight. That is what I counted. Oh, do not worry about it. What about breakfast? I'm afraid you will have to go without breakfast. Mrs. Rogers died in her sleep. -- What? -- How? -- Heart failure? - Her heart certainly failed to beat. - What caused it to fail, I can not say. - Conscience. Oh, conscience, my eye? What about her husband? He feared to death because his wife is a talker. I am sorry, I am sorry there is no breakfast prepared ... ... but you see, my wife ... All right, Rogers. We understand. But I thought you told us he was dead. - His wife. -- What? -- His wife! -- Wife? No, no, no, I do not think a man would ever kill his wife. No matter how guilty she was. "The wicked flee when no one pursues. " Two accidental deaths in 12 hours? I do not believe it! Nor do I! What do you say, judge? How does the rhyme go, Miss. Claythorne? -- 10 little indians ...? - One choked his little self and then there were 9. - Go on ... - One overslept himself ... ... and there were 8. We are 8 people on this island now. -- Lombard! -- I will be ready in a minute! Take your time! -- You know I got it? -- Got what! There is one thing this fellow Owen forgot. This island is just a bare rock. We'll catch that raving maniac. There has to be some place he is hiding on the island. Do you mean Rogers is lying? Why not? He is scared. Scared out of his head. That's why I think he is telling the truth. A lunatic like Owen found a hiding place ... ... before Rogers arrived here. It doesn't matter if Rogers is lying or not. You agree that Mr. Owen is quite a diving, don't you? He'd certainly be dangerous. You ought to be armed. Yes, too bad it is not allowed to carry firearms in England. It would be for all of us a great disadvantage. You mean you haven't any weapon? You know, Mr. Blore the strange thing is that I came to the same conclusion as you did. Mr. Owen is hiding, may be inside this house. I fear that I am being watched. Secretly. What do you see? I thought I heard a strange voice. Gentlemen, I have come to the conclusion that ... ... the invisible Mr. Owen is hiding somewhere on the island. Extraordinary. I was looking for you to tell you the same thing. - That is what I think so. - Me, too. We all come to the same conclusion. We must find his place of concealment. Immediately. So long as he is at large ... ... we all face a mortal danger. Do you hear that? Hello, puss. Looking for a mouse? So are we. Well, I like to know it is whether we are the cat or the mouse. He is not in his room. I can't find the General . I wonder where the old boy.... I do not know. I don't think he even knows where he is himself. Nothing in there. But the russian ... ... I keep hearing the song he was singing last night. -10 little indians. - Certainly, it was his swan song. One thing is certain. He is not inside. Therefore, he must be outside. Brilliant thinking, Blore! I am afraid there is no use for watching the boat. One comes on Monday. No boat will ever come, Juliet. We're here forever. What made you love him, Juliet? Sir John! Oh, Forgive me my child. You do not understand. -- Nobody! -- Not a living thing! Not even a hiding place! Not even a seagull could hide down there. I do not understand. Maybe we have been wrong! It was a nightmare out of our imagination. Two people dead is not imagination! The Russian might have commited suicide. And Mrs. Rogers? Well, you didn't give her an overdose last night, did you? Doctors can't afford to make mistakes of that kind. We can not blunder the detectives sometimes do. It wouldn't be the first mistake if that gramophone record is to be believed. Gentlemen, gentlemen, there is no time for quarelling! Let's face it, we're in a trap. You shouldn't forget the 10 indians on the dinner table. That's right. Mr. Owen's hand is plain to see. Yes, but where is Mr. Owen himself? If Mr. Owen is on this island, he catches death of cold. If this is not supposed to be a joke, I don't see the point. All we have to do is to keep quiet and hear him sneeze. I'm sorry. It is only cold meat and salad, that was the best I could. All right, Rogers. - Rogers, we are only 7 today. - Oh, sorry. -- Did you call the General Mandrake? - I looked in his room ... ... but he is not there. - Didn't he come in the house? - I didn't see him, doctor. After high tide he was moving around on the beach. - It seems quite abnormal. - I know where he is. You stay here, Miss. Claythorne. You say the General was behaving very strangely? Like a man out of his mind. In other words, a lunatic. The old boy was barmy. "Then God destroys first the mad man. " And well? Aren't we looking for a lunatic? He said no boat would ever come. Then he knows something! Maybe he is not as crazy as we think he is. Doctor, you'd better come with me. Don't wait for us. And don't wait the General any longer. Poisonous glass could mean suicide. An overdose of cyanide might have been an accident. But this instrument which you saw me remove ... ... from the back of the third victim ... ... means only one thing: murder. Or an act of God. My dear Lady, in my experience of ill-doing, Providence ... leaves the work ... of punishment to us mortals. Evidently, Mr. Owen believes we were guilty of ... ... certain crimes which the law can not touch ... ... and is pointed to himself to execute justice. That's why he had enticed us to this island. There is no one on this island! I tell you! No one! Doctor Armstrong! What's it, man? There is another Indian figure missing. - That accounts for the General. - I was expecting that. You just said, there is no one on this island. In the sense you mean, no. Nevertheless I am now certain that Mr. Owen is here. How can he be here? I do not believe in the invisible man! He is not invisible. Mr. Owen could only come to this island on one way. Perfectly clear. Mr. Owen is one of us. Do you have to do that? I was studying Mr. Owen's little scheme. Maybe you know how the General was killed. My dear Blore, Can't you read? 8 little indian boys travelling in Devon, ... one said he'd stay there ... ... and then there were 7. The old soldier stayed here, didn't he? -- Am I disturbing your little game? - Not at all, Blore. Nothing clarifies mind like game of precision ... What game you are playing, judge? -- We have come to the conclusion that is, Doctor and I ... this sort of story is a game of the mind. Here we are. Eight of us come to this island. The Rogers were waiting for us. Do not forget, waiting for us. One of the 10 is Mr. Owen. I'd agree on that. Out of all of us, 3 persons are definitely cleared. -- Who? -- The dead ones! Our Russian friend, Mrs. Rogers and the General. -7 little indians left. -6, one is Bogus. Correct, sir. One of us is Mr. Owen. Which one? -- Where is your alibi? -- I'm not like you, Mr. Blore! I am an honourable professional man! I fear, doctor, that true is less than nothing. I too am an honourable person. But doctors have gone mad before now. Judges have gone mad and so the policemen. And that NASA explorers, Mr. Lombard? You may leave me. Why do you leave Miss. Claythorne out of it? - We don't. -- And you, My dear lady? I appreciate that nobody can be exonerated without proof. What about Rogers? - That is what I was thinking. - What do we know about him. He put that record on the gramophone, didn't he? That's a fact! How do we know that Rogers did not lease this house ... and pretended to be the ... butler? Oh, no, no! Bad psychology! You can rule Rogers out definitely. I do not see why. Look at the shape of his head. He hasn't got brains for it. And do not forget the something else, sir. My wife was one of the victims! In my time, Rogers, I've had several of the husbands who were guilty of killing their wives. Well, If you put it that way, Sir. They ... They do sometimes drive ... a man crazy. We must suspect each and every one of us. Now I warn everybody to be on his guard. If not, We'll all go the same way. And Mr. Owen would soon be all alone on this island. Keep quite, Miss. Clayhorne. Aren't you afraid the others would think you are playing in appropria... I can't stand silence. I have to do something. Go on playing. If any comfort to you, there is one person who doesn't suspect you. Thank you. Aren't you going to return the compliment? I haven't made up my mind about you, Mr. Lombard. Who do you suspect? One nearest the fire. - I think you're wrong. -- Who then? A man who believes in punishing crimes. His dream might snap and he wants to be executioner, after having been a judge. Rogers, I'd like to ask you a few questions. Did you ... -... prepare a nice dinner? - Oh, just cold meat, sir. I see now. I show you do your bed. Is there plenty of food for the weekend? Yes, sir. Everything were provided for. Mr. Blore, may I ask you a question? Of course, of course, my dear fellow. How many will you be for dinner tonight? Oh, I see what you mean. Do not forget your vote, Rogers. In a case like this, the secret vote ... ... is the only way to being out into the open what we are thinking. No, no, no, never touch it, no. But under the circumstances... Well, who do we suspect is Mr. Owen? Mr. Lombard, one vote. Mr. Blore, one vote. Dr. Armstrong, one vote. Rogers, one vote. Miss. Brent, one vote. I see I haven't been neglected: One vote. Another vote for you. Rogers. You win. Do you mean, sir, I am being accused? Well, It is not absolute majority, but you have more votes. They are saying this because I'm only a butler. You said I didn't have the brain to do it. - I didn't vote for you, Rogers. -- Who did it then? Who didn't drink the cocktail you just served? You think I poisoned those cocktails? I will show you, sir! Picking on an innocent man! I can even gulp all the alcohol! And if that is what you think of me, ... ... I'm not going to serve any dinner. Rogers, come back here! You can not do that! Don't look so offended, Rogers. If it had been anybody but you, Sir. ... I'm sorry, Rogers. -- But how do I know that you did't vote for me? I did not, your honour. I voted for ... well ... Time will tell. After all, Rogers, nobody in this house ... ... is above suspicion. Never in my life have I been accused of any crime, sir. What about that gramophone record? What about it? That woman you worked for ... ... she left you some money, didn't she? Let's not stand on our dignity, Rogers. After all, she was sick. Didn't you shortened her suffering in this world? With the complicity, of course, of the poor Mrs. Rogers? I'm not going to argue with you, Sir. But what makes you think I would ... kill anybody ... who wasn't going to leave me any money? No, thank you. Pardon me. Obviously, we can't sit up all night like this. I'm going to retire. Good night. If you don't mind, I'll say good night too. If you don't mind, Miss. Claythorne ... ... I'd rather go upstairs alone. May I remind you, Miss Brent, I'm the only one whose name wasn't mentioned ... ... in the voting. That's what I mean. I find that fact most peculiar. I know Miss. Brent won't mind ... ...a third person. Not so fast, Mr. Lombard! I will go with you.! The more, the merrier! and the safer. Warm in here, isn' it? - Yes, quite warm, quite warm. - And lonely. - Yes, quite lonely, quite, quite lonely. -- Rogers! -- Yes, sir? Would you mind giving us company for a while? Anything you wish, sir. - Don't pour any water. - Are you sure, sir? Good night, Miss. Claythorne. Don't you forget to lock your door. You can not lock out the devil. I think we have another one who is barmy. Total end'll be locked going that way. I don't you will, Blore. Now, it takes a lot to send me off my way. -- I don't believe you be going that way either. -- Are you quite sane at the moment Thank you. -- Have you told him? - Yes, sir. I know the jury's decision. You'll feel safer if I didn't sleep inside the house tonight. Well then, I shall sleep in the woodshed. And now if you will excuse me ... Good night. - Now I'll lock it behind me. - That is not enough, Mr. Blore. There is still 7. Lock that door, please. Put the key there. We'll have no more indian tricks tonight. Lock it, Mr. Blore. Wait! Now no one can enter but you. Oh, I see. But, Who's going to keep it? -- Rogers! Open up, Rogers! - Keep away from that door. It's me, Lombard! Open up! Don't take me for a fool, Mr. Lombard? -- Do not be silly, Rogers! - Don't be silly yourself, Sir. This is judge Quinncannon, you know my voice, Rogers! -- And Dr. Armstrong! This is Blore, Rogers. Open the door! In a time like this I wouldn't open the door ... ... even if it was Santa Claus. We just want you to give a key. -- What for? -- Never mind, you idiot! Hurry up! It's raining! Shove it under the door, sir. Good night, Rogers. Keep the door locked. Do not worry about me, sir. - Be careful, judge. - Oh, sure. You know the common cold kills more people than ... ... never mind. I need hardly advise you lock your doors. And put a chair under the handle. In such a way nobody turn the locks from the outside. If it turns out that one of you is Mr. Owen, ... just remember ... I'm a very light sleeper. - Good night. - Good night. May we all meet safe in the morning. - Good night. - Good night, sir. Miss. Brent! Miss. Brent! She doesn't answer! -- The door locked? -- Of course, try it! She is not here! You grasp the task very quickly, Blore! -- What's wrong, Mr. Blore? - Miss. Brent is missing. I tried all the doors and she was the only one ... ... did not answer. What is wrong with her? She is the only one slept. I heard her get up. She must have gone upstairs. - I locked that door last night. -- Who opened it? Look. Good morning, such a good pattern. Like a copy from your shore. Wasn't that door was locked when you left out? Yes, I opened it. Good morning, Miss. Brent. I sure like to walk before breakfast ... ... but I would't gone out alone. I feel perfectly safe when I'm alone. Thank you. I share your feeling. But didn't you know that Rogers was outside? Poor man. I hope he can't catch cold. -- Who is there? - Someone's knocking. -- Kitchen door. - Rogers, of course. - He wants to get in. - Let's see whether it is all about breakfast. -- Where is he? - Someone was knocking. Rogers! Rogers! - He is not there. -- Rogers! Do you know what I think? We got our man. It's Rogers! It fits the psychological pattern. His behavior last night ... ... was just strictly abnormal. Psychological fact in my eye! I go by facts. He was officially accused, facts! Got drunk, he wouldn't open ... the door ... of the woodshed, facts! Analising this morning ... he's gone in his hand with this rope, he disappears. Facts! Another fact you haven't mentioned about Rogers. He's dead. The murderer was fastidious. He cleaned this ... after striking down ... his victim. Obviously he crept up behind, ... ... and swung this chopper and brought it down ... ... splitting the cranium. 7 littile indian boys chopping off sticks, one chopped himself in half ... ... and then there were 6. Were you not needed much strength to strike that blow? A woman could have done it if that is what you mean. Miss. Claythorne was locked in her room, doctor. If that's what you mean. We were all in our rooms, except ... -- No breakfast yet? - No. If I had a butler like Rogers. I'd soon get rid of him. -- Wait! We've forgotten something! -- What? The dining room! Still locked. -- Where is the key? I found it in Rogers's pocket. -1, 2,3,4,5,6. -- Another one missing? But the door was locked. I get it! No, I don't. Did you ever hear a bee sting deemed fatal? No, why? 6 little indian boys playing with a hive, ... ... a bumblebee stung one and then there were 5. Very stupid to kill the only servant in the house. Now we don't even know where to find the marmalade. Watch out for a bee. Be careful with that young man. I mean to, Miss Brent. I am careful of everyone. A clear conscience is the best armour. This island's an image of life. Innocence has to go round about criminals. It sounds like Mr. Owen talking. I see nothing wrong with this idea ... ...of punishing the guilty. What about his accusations against you.? I wonder if these eggs are fresh. What about Miss Brent, your young nephew? Aren't you to blame for his death? Family gossip, Miss. Claythorne. My sister's boy had bad blood. On his father's side, of course. Putting him to no good. Naturally, I had to place him in a reformatory. I do hope that these eggs are not quite cooked. What happened to the boy? Why, I never saw him yet. He added to his many sins by hanging himself. I got it! I know who broke the last Indian. -- Who? - Rogers. He had the key to this room, fact! He sneaks in, to break the little indian ... locks the door ... again, ... goes back to the woodshed where ... he chops some sticks, fact! - And then ... -- And then? He takes his chopper and breaks his own cranium, ... ... as the Doctor would say, fact! All that you invent, Blore, would take practice! Anyone inside the house could leave without being noticed. -- Is it true, Miss. Brent? - Perfectly true. The murderer meets Rogers outside and kills him. He then takes the key from his victim's pocket, and you know the rest. Yes, but the key was still in Rogers' pocket! Of course. The murderer puts the key in Rogers' pocket and goes to bed again. Oh, all goes for an innocent walk before breakfast. Sorry, Miss. Brent. Does anyone want more tea? Lombard! -- Lombard! - Yes, Blore? -- What're you doing here? - You called me, didn't you? Yes, oh, yes, yes. I am saying but don't you think the old judge knows too much ... describing every move ... You'd think he had been at the scene of the crime. My dear Blore: In my opinion ... ... You haven't a chance. - Why is that? - Lack of an imagination. A criminal with a brain like you and Owen ... can take rings about you ... anytime he wants to. No man ever got the bear of me ... yet. How about a woman? Yes, yes, one should never trust a woman. She is clearly manic-depressive. I do not know if I did see it before. She was very strange in the kitchen this morning. We're all behaving strangely, but I find ... no evidence ... she left no clue. But she did. What about this, he? No sane person would think of using ... ... as a pattern for shore. She guides us out of the track. It's her! I steak my life, it is her. Wait, Blore. Let Miss. Claythorne call her. She will be less suspicious. Miss. Brent! Miss. Brent! Miss. Brent! Miss. Brent! It is no use, Miss. Claythorne. She'd not answer. look at the bee! look at the bee! It's just an ordinary bee, Miss. Claythorne. Nothing, but a small mark on the neck. Here is your bee, doctor. Somebody must have taken it, it is not here. You see for yourself. -- What poison was there? - I can only guess. It was very powerful. She must have died immediately. But the bee, that bee in her room ...! So our murderer has artistic touch. He likes to stick to the nasty nursery Jeckyll. He's mad. We are all mad. I'm not, Mr. Lombard. I still have my reasoning powers. There are five of us left, one of us is the murderer. - The rest of us are defenceless. -- Defenseless? How do we know if anyone hasn't got a revolver? Good point, Blore! How do we know? What I know I haven't got one. It is in England against the law. -- How about you, Doctor? You may Search me, John, search me! -- Miss. Claythorne? - I wish I had. He is quite right, Miss Claythorne, it is an unfortunate oversight. But she'd never be careless visiting a place ... ...when one doesn't know. Why didn't you tell us you had a revolver? Nobody asked me. Let's search his pockets! Aren't you wasting your time? I know where it is. Judge you said now that one of us was the murderer. If I were you, I wouldn't let Blore to get that gun. -- It's not here! - Look again, Blore. It has got to be there. -- Look in his pocket! -- No! It is not here. -- What did you do with it? -- What did you with it? Good heavens, where is it? No one can answer that question, ... He is obviously ... not going to speak. At a time like this! A game of the mind against another game of the mind. The best thing for you do do it is stay in your room. Put the door locked And what about yourself? I wouldn't say I am here alone with any of the others. Why not? Don't you think it's strange that it never occured a third person when anything unpleasent occured? Mr. Owen, Owen manages to be alone with his victims. When a third person is present, nothing happens. Doesn't that make you nervous? Are you with me alone? But we are not alone. I asked Mr. Blore ... ... to keep an eye on. He is my third person. Blore! Look, another misfortune. Something wrong with the machinery. The gas must be running down. We can't keep every lights burning tonight. I will go to woodshed, and see what is going. Leave it on, doctor, leave it on! So you know the person who does the killings. You went away from the window and left me alone. I've got to go to the woodshed. You better get into ... ... your room and lock your door. I shall. Where is Miss. Claythorne? I do not know. -- Where is Blore? - He was out in the woodshed. Woodshed? What's wrong, Doctor? Oh, I see. you and I, we're alone in the house. -- Lombard! -- Lombard! Come here! -- Where is Vera? -- Vera? -- Miss. Claythorne! -- Don't come close! -- Where is she? -- Keep back! Blore, if you don't tell me, I swear I'll kill you. If you don't move out, I'll kill you. No, Doctor, please, give me a chance. If you are Mr. Owen, for heaven's sake tell me. I swear that I won't say a word to the others. Don't torment me this way. If you want to kill the others, I won't interfere. I won't say a word. ... I'll even help you if you spare my life. Look, I trust you. Don't you trust me? - Yes. That is more reasonable. Don't come here closer! -- Isn't your arm getting tired? -- Do not worry about me! Listen! If Miss Claythorne is safe in his room, as you say,... ... we both are behaving like idiots. Don't you take me a barmy. I prefer living here. Someone is coming. -- Miss. Claythorne! -- I told you stayed locked in your room! I am looking for a. .. Uuh. He is right, Vera. We should be more careful! -- Come on! -- Stay here! Both of you! Now I can do what I came out to do. Do you know anything about electricity? Do not bother me. I get it! -- Stay where you are! - I shan't move an inch. Neither will I. Until the light comes on. -- Do you think it will? -- Why not? This is no accident. Someone wants... ... this house to be dark tonight. -- Who? - The one we fear. Do not fear, Doctor. But he has made a mistake. This trick of putting out the lights ... ... He has 2 people, you and me. Now we can trust each other. I see! Yes, the idea was to keep us to fear each other. But now we can form alibis you and I. and find the murderer. We no longer have anything to conceal from each other, have we? Oh, oh, I needed that. -- And now? - Now we can tell each other the truth, the entire truth. Who's going to speak first? Very well, I shall begin. As you know, Mr. Owen is saying that I was responsible ... ...for the death of one Edward Seaton. It is perfectly true. He was an innocent man on trial for his life. I had nothing against him. I just wanted to ruin the reputation of his defending council ... ... who lost the case, while his client ... ... lost his life. Doctor? Tell us the truth. Your fate depends on that. I'm convinced to that. The gramophone record did not lie... ...I operated on Mrs. Creese while I was under the influence of... Guilty I was. But of drinking, not of killing. I do not see where this is getting us. Sit down, Mr. Blore. This is getting us to a very important conclusion. -- Is it not right, doctor? If I were you, I would speak, Mr. Blore. -- I did not kill anybody! - We are listening, Mr. Blore. The plain old chap was innocent, all right. but I was mixed up ... ... with a gang without a .... On my testimony he got sentenced for life. That's all. But he died in prison, didn't he? -- Of course he did! How could I know that would happen? What about yours., Mr. Lombard, ... ... what about those 21 poor natives in South Africa? Don't get excited, Blore. Mr. Lombard is unable to deny a thing. Aaa! It's the first thing you said I believe. Are you leaving us, Miss. Claythorne? - My poor child, you're trembling. -I, I am so cold. Would you like us to postpone this inqury ... ... until litting the fire? That would mean going outside to get wood as Rogers did. No, we'll wait while you get your coat. Thank you. Stay here, Mr. Lombard. Nothing can happen to her while we all remain in this room. -- Bring a light! -- Who is you see? -- I'm Lombard, where is Blore? - How do I know? It's dark. -- Where have you been all this time? - I went to my room to get this candle. -- Where have you been? - I have been looking for my flashlight. Where is Blore? Blore! What the devil you're doing in my room? Your room? That's why I couldn't find anything. -- What happened to you? - Somebody bumped into me. -- Did you hear anything? - Yes, something like a shot. It sounds you are a bit jumpy, both of you. Nerves. It is Vera's. Vera? Vera! What happened? Don't be frightened. What happened? - He was in my room. -- Who? - I felt ... something like a hand. -- Who was it? I, I do not know, my candles went out. We'll soon find out. Lights! Lights! Lights! Seaweed. It felt like a cold hand. That is what Miss. Claythorne walked into. Who brought it in here? Who brought it into the house? - Miss. Brent. -- Are you sure Miss Brent is ...? Dead as a dawn I know ... -- Where is the judge? That's funny, I thought he came up with us. So did I. He was right behind me on the staircase. I thought I bumped into him when I heard that shot. -- Shot! What I tell you? -- What? The funny old man knew too much. -- You see, you heard a shot. - Yes. Do not you see? It took us by surprise in the dark. He played us a trick to go downstairs. There is one way to find out. It's my revolver. Now, it looks too easy. All right, judge, come outside. Do not think I can not see you. He has been shot through the head. Only one shot was fired. Who will be next? Another one proved innocent. Too late. He found a solution. That's why he had to be silenced. -- Silenced by who? -- by whom? Don't you remember? Ah, one moment, Miss. Claythorne! Just the judge was about to question you, ... ... You came up here presumably to get your coat. True? Yes. You open that door, wind blows out your candles, ... ... seeweed touches your face, ... ... You scream. Perfect, perfect. But considreable time elapses, and then we find you way down there. What made you on the wrong way? She did not know where she was going. She was hysterical. Agreed. But if Miss. Claythorne had not screamed, ... ... we would still be in the dining room ... ... and the judge would be alive. Wait a minute. Don't confuse things. One of you two pulled the trigger and .. ... put a blame on Miss Claythorne. And You wait a minute, Mr Lombard. We all know very well that the judge ... ... was on the point of an important discovery. What do we know what is in judge's mind? I do know. He took me to his confidence. Truth, entire truth. Miss. Claythorne, did you or did you not commit ... ... the crime which the gramaphone accused you? I'd rather not talk about it. Aah, but you must. We all confessed ... our little ... errors. All except you. Come now, my girl. You didn't really kill this Bartley chap, did you? Will you take my word if I tell you I did not? I'm afraid, I will. Then you have my word for it. And don't ask me any more questions. Can't you see she is telling the truth? That is precisely her mistake. - I do not see why. - You will. You will. The judge reasoned us. Owen enticed us to this island ... ... to be punished for past crimes. Right! We 3 had a bit of... shall I say, our guilt. Right! Therefore, we can not be interested ... ... in punishment of a crime. Right! Conclusion: Owen is the one who has not committed any past crime. I get it! What a wonderful brain. The thing, he could not save his own life. Yes, but he saved ours. Yes, of course, that is the important thing. Do you understand now, Mr. Lombard? Oh, it is great, convincing, mathematical deduction. - Oh, wait a minute. -- Oh, no! Not you either, Blore. - Now nobody has it. -- It is an excellent arrangement! Now we can all sleep. I'll turn in, gentlemen. Good night, gentlemen. Doctor, I find one flaw in your theory. I can destroy it in 4 words, do you want to hear them? Suppose I said: "I am Mr. Owen. " It would be most interesting. But quite unlikely. Trouble with you, Lombard, is, nobody can believe you. Too bad. I just wanted to be helpfull. Good night, sleep well. I hope I will. I'm sure I will. How long have you been out there? Shsh, not so loud. How long have you been out there? - Ever since you put out your light. -- Why? I wanted to be here to welcome ... ... Mr. Owen. Locking you in this room and leaving the key outside ... ... is a little too obvious, isn't it? It is the doctor or Blore. Unless I am mistaken, one of them ... ...is going to come through that door in any minute. How do I know he is not here already? You. If you believed that, you wouldn't have opened your window. -- What about me? - You are not smart enough. Quick thinking girl would have confessed to any old crime ... ... in order to clear herself what's happened in this house. Are you sure you didn't not kill this fellow Bartley? Maybe you forgot about it ... Or maybe he never existed. Yes-he did. - Or maybe he was never killed. Yes, he was. But someone who was close to you.? You were suspected? What happened to that someone who was close to you.? She was my sister. I took care of her until the very last. Oh, now I see that Mr. Owen is not that infallible. You don't belong in this house. You haven't killed your way into it. Are you not ashamed of talking like this, Mr. Lombard? Do not call me "Mister". And don't call me Lombard. I tell you something about this Mr Lombard. Something else that Mr. Owen does not know ... Listen! Give me a chance to grab him when he comes in. Don't shoot unless you have to. - He is going away. - Downstairs. I am going to find out. I forgot it's locked! I will go round the other way! - Take the gun. -- No, you keep it! If I can't get back! He might kill you. If he does he is going to make a serious mistake. The other thing he does not know is I'm not Mr. Lombard. Now I'll find out. It is either Blore or the doctor. The one is locked in his room. Blore! Blore! Get out. Open the door! -- Who did take her out of her room? -- Never mind about her! Come on, Blore! He is not here. Now we know who he is. I've to go downstairs, Come on, Blore quick! We'll catch him. -- How do I know you heard the doctor? - Do not be a fool, Blore. - We have no time to waste. - Life is short, isn't it? I heard him too, Mr. Blore. - You did, did you? It is a nice present you got there. Mr. Lombard is getting generous. You go first! Come on, Vera! It might be a trick. Right, Blore. Maybe he is in the house. 1, 2.3. Three Indians only. He wants to make us think he's dead. He intends to throw us off the track. You won't fool us this time, Dr. Armstrong! Who is there? Lombard! Blore. What are you doing down there alone? I think I know where the doctor is. -- Where? - I'm not sure yet. I'll wait for you. All right. We shan't be long. I get it! Are not you being careless unlocking your door ... when you do not know ... who is out here? I thought it was you. -- You heard him, too, heh? - I heard him pass my door. It was not me. I thought I heard you. Are you sure you haven't been outside of your room? I was going to ask you the same thing. Maybe Mr. Blore came back to his room. No, no, no, I knocked on his door. I heard a noise ... while I was dressing... -- Like a door slamming? - Exactly. You heard it, too, huh? -- What's it? - I do not know. I have a feeling all the time that there is someone ... -...someone waiting and watching. - Sure, I know what you mean. - Oh, it's just nerves. - Then you feel the same. Keep a grip on yourself, darling. There is nothing supernatural about this business. It is definitely human. You mean it is the doctor? - The mad doctor. -- Hiding here? We'll soon find out. He must have been looking that way. And I wonder, what was he looking, Dr. Armstrong ... That was Armstrong we both heard. What was Blore looking at? What do you see? What is it? -- Impossible! -- Let me see! We're going to see. Come with me. What is it? What's it? Tell me. Look! Armstrong. He's been dead for hours. -- For hours? - Since the last tide. There are no foot traces around the body. But if he was ... Who killed Blore? Yes, there are only 2 people alive on this island. - You. - And you. So this is how it ends, Vera. This is how it ends, we come to the truth now. Yes, the truth. The entire truth. Don't come any closer! Oh, I see. That's not quite right, my dear. It doesn't fit in your nursery rhyme. Do not try to talk your way out. You made one mistake giving me this revolver. Look, I do not mind being killed. But I hate ... like the devil you killed ... someone else. Didn't I tell you I wasn't Lombard? -- What is your name? - Charles Morley. You're not a very good detective. Mr. Blore spotted initials C. M. my luggage at the moment I arrived here. Why did you come here under another name? I knew Lombard very well. He committed suicide. I wanted to find out if Mr. Owens' letter ... ... had anything to do with it. -- Do you expect me to believe it? -- Why not? There is something much more difficult to believe. One of us is Mr. Owen. I know I am not, and I simply can't believe that you're. Do not try to fool me. I know I am not. It has got to be you. There is no other explanation. If you're so sure, go ahead and shoot me. You see? You have a doubt. Don't come any closer, I'll shot! No, you won't, you can't shoot. You still trust me, I still trust you. There's got to be an explanation. Yes, that is it! You've got to shoot me! -- Now shoot! - But I don't want to hit you. That is what I mean, shoot! Don't be frightened when I fall. A game of the mind, Miss. Claythorne. You came just in time for my last shot ... ... and now the game is over. One little indian boy left all alone, he went and hanged himself ... ... and then there were none. It is for you., Miss. Claythorne. What if I don't agree to hang myself? Oh, that's been taken care of. Do you mind if I sit down? Every artist has a certain amount of vanity. And we all like the approbation of the public. And you are my last public I had 2 great ideas. The first was a search for perfect human justice. And you've seen the result. To perfect the scheme, my second idea was ... ...to find an unblinking accomplice ... ... among the criminals invited here for punishment. I needed a respectable fool ... ... and naturally I selected ... ... a man whose fear of death ... ... might make him extremely cooperative. I proposed a scheme to confuse ... ... the imaginary Mr. Owen. It was simply this: I must appear ... ... to be the next victim. Remember the seaweed? Armstrong and I placed it in your room. Your scream was perfect. We pretended to rush out, but according to our plan, ... ... we came back. Now, I was assumed to be dead. Killed by that gun I had borrowed from Mr. Lombard. and which he found later on the step. I counted on everyone's confusion at the dark. And I counted on Armstrong who played his part to the end. I knew nobody would challenge the doctor's authority ... ... when he would say: "He has been shot through the head. " After that, I had to play my part. And what a part it was! No one would suspect me. Least of all the dear doctor ... ... who thought that I was about to discover the unknown murderer ... ... and He was waiting for me on the beach ... worrying about ... the success of our plan. For a few minutes later, he had nothing more to worry about. Justice had triumphed once again. Too late he'd learn that drinking one gets out of his hand ... ... can be fatal. So you see, the whole thing has been as inevitable ... ... as the nursery rhyme. When the boat arrives from the mainland, ... ... there will be 10 dead bodies and a riddle ... ... that no one can solve in the Indian Island. Ten? My dear child, I'm an old and sick man. I received my death sentence a year ago. Rather than go painfully and slowly ... I choose to leave this ... wicked world ... ... with a record of good deeds. How can you force me to hang myself? The only living person found here ... ... with 9 corpses, would have certainly be hanged. as the last indian has to be. Public hanging isn't pretty. If you allow me to give you a piece of friendly advice, do it now privately. More dignified. And now my work is done. Never should entrust a woman. Thanks for the advice, Mr. Owen. If I hadn't trusted you, darling, you hadn't trusted me ... By the way, why did you trust me? Why did you? On account of one thing Mr. Owen couldn't forsee. Someone is still alive! Good morning. -- Ready to leave now? -- Always! Are the others waiting too? You call them.
