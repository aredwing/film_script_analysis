Yes, I go there myself. Well, thank goodness for that. Do you live near Bistritz? I'm traveling there on business. Oh. So am I. I'm a lawyer or rather I hope I'm going to be one, from London. (Whistle) From London. I'm going there to visit one of our clients. Maybe you know him, Count Dracula? Do you know him? My dear sir, may God preserve you because if you go to visit Count Dracula. You may need God's help. Are you the Englishman... Jonathan Harker. We have strict orders from the Count to look after you. A place has been reserved for you on the stage coach tomorrow. And the Count's own carriage will meet you at the Borgo's Pass. Vladimir. I s anything the matter? Oh. No. Sir. Your bedroom is ready upstairs and we have prepared some food for you. Thank you. But I'm feeling very tired. I'll be going to bed early. Very good, sir. (Howling) (Thunder) (Loud Thunder) Who is it? What do you want? Excuse me. Sir. I wanted to talk to you but my husband said I should not. But tomorrow. Tomorrow night, is St. George's night. What of it? Oh. When the clock strikes midnight all the evils of the world circle around us. Sir. Do know where you're going or what you are going to...? Greta? I must go. Good morning. Well. I rather missed you last night. I chose other company sir. Why do you look at me so strangely? Why does everybody look at me like that? Because tonight is St. George's night and... And what else? They know your destination. Excuse me. How far is it to the Borgo's Pass? We'll be there by nightfall. And from the Pass to Count Dracula's castle? You'd best ask whoever meets you sir. To tell the truth. I've never seen the place, and please God I never shall. This is the Borgo's Pass. May God protect you sir. (Sound of carriage arriving) The night is cold and my master, the Count, bade me take all care of you. No thank you, I don't need it. As you wish but it gives both warmth and courage. (Howling) (Growling) Welcome to my house. Count Dracula? I am Dracula. Enter freely and of your own will. It is late and my servants have gone to bed. I will see to your comfort myself. You will need to refresh yourself after your journey. I trust that you will find everything you require. I shall await your pleasure. You do not dine sir? I've already dined. I hope you'll find everything in order. The purchase document, duly receipted, the title deed to the house. The plans. The house is in poor condition but it stands back well away from the main road to London. Completely isolated, just as you required. It is strongly built but it has remained empty for quite a long time. Yes. Yes, an empty house, it is exactly what I require. Have you lived here for many years? All my life. Your wife? No, I'm not married yet but the lady on the left is my fiancee. And the other? Ms. Lucy Westenra, her closest friend. Charming. Thank you. Forgive me for asking sir, but why do you plan to live in England? I am not young and yet I am restless. And what about this great castle? It is, I presume, the family home? True. The shadows of my past remain here. We are the second Magyars we have a right to be proud. For in us flows the blood of many brave races, the blood of a Attila is in these veins. To us was entrusted for centuries the guardian of our lands. The Lombard. The Bulgar, the Turk. Poured their thousands against our frontiers, we drove them back. The Dracula's have ever been the hearts. Blood. The brains. The sword of our people. One of my race crossed the Danube and destroyed the Turkish host. Though sometimes beaten back he came again and again against the enemy til at the end he came alone from the bloody field, for he alone could triumph. This was a Dracula indeed. But now. The wind blows coldly through the broken battlements. Although this is my home, I must move on. I don't regret my journey, but surely the post might have served you much easier and far cheaper. If I am to begin a new life in a new land I must learn something of its people from such as yourself. You are my honored guest. (Howling) Listen to them. The children of the night, what music they make. But you are weary, you shall sleep late. You are most gracious but my employers, your solicitors expect me back in London. We shall see. But for now you are here at my invitation. Nay, at my command. Come. Do you enjoy the chase Mr. Harker? I've never had the opportunity. The greatest of all sports, you have the power of life and death over a living being. Good night, Mr. Harker. (Bat screeching) You are first and we shall follow. Yours is the right to begin. He is young and strong. There are kisses for us all. Back! This man belongs to me. He is ours. We found him first. (Baby crying) (Whispering) Jonathan. Jonathan. Jonathan. Jonathan. Jonathan. Jonathan. This rman belongs to rme. (Screarm) Good morning. Where am I? Who are you? I am Dr. Seward and this is Professor Van Helsing's private clinic not far from London. How did I get here? Your body was found in a mountain stream two hundred kilometers from Budapest. But what of Count Dracula? I escaped from his castle, but he followed me with the others disguised as bats, giant bats, with great teeth, waiting to draw blood. I didn't dream it. The bats were real. As big as men. Why don't you believe me? What are you doing? Have you made inquiries? This young Englishman, Jonathan Harker. Had been reported missing some weeks ago. Some friends of his are on their way to London to identify him and see what they can do. I see. Did he speak? A little. Not much. He kept mumbling something about a certain Count Dracula. Dracula? (Screarms in background) That's Renfield again. See to it. Yes. Professor. Good morning Renfield. What is it Renfield. Hmm? Renfield. Nobody's going to hurt you. What is it Renfield? Ah, yes, somebody's bought the old house. It's been empty long enough. Renfield. Nobody's going to hurt you. Let him be. I'll see him again later. Miss Murray? Yes? I was ordered to drive you to the clinic. This way please. Van Helsing's Clinic. Drive on. (Dog barking) Mina look. What's that? Silly. Professor Helsing's assistant awaits you upstairs. I'll take care of the luggage. Thank you. Jonathan. Jonathan. Jonathan. Mina. Lucy? (Screarms in other roorm) Jonathan, what is this place? Please. He must rest. I urge you not to show him that you are alarmed. I want to know what is wrong with him. We specialize here in the treatment of the mentally disturbed. You mean you think Jonathan is mad? (Screarming) Oh. (Screarming) Your friend is in need of attention. She should not have been allowed to travel. She insisted on coming with me. Couldn't you help her Professor? It would perhaps be best if she stays here. Dr. Seward and I could look after her. I n that case I shall stay here too. Very well. I shall have rooms prepared for you both. Professor Van Helsing? Yes? Jonathan is sane. Completely sane. It's not quite as simple as that. There is no doubt that he has suffered a shock of some kind. The result is that either he's subconsciously relating a nightmare, or he's lying. Jonathan wouldn't lie. And he's not mad. Then perhaps you can persuade him to remember what really happened because without... (Groaning) Lucy. Mina, forgive me. I'm so stupid to faint. Oh. I shouldn't of let you come, a long journey, and now this. (Knock on door) Sir. Prepare two rooms for the ladies on the ground floor. Yes. Sir. I should warn you. I have a number of patients here who must be kept in close confinement. Do not on any account venture beyond the first floor please. Well, I shall leave you. You must both be tired after your journey. Your rooms will be ready soon. (Whispering) Lucy. Lucy. Lucy. Lucy. Lucy. Lucy. Lucy. Lucy. Lucy. Lucy. Lucy. Lucy. Lucy. Lucy. Lucy? Lucy? Lucy? (Whispering) Lucy. Lucy? Lucy? Lucy? Lucy? Lucy? You say you thought you saw a man. I was mistaken. I n these two spots? There was a pin which held her wrap. Perhaps you pricked her by accident when you undid it. She appears to be suffering from a very considerable loss of blood. I shall have to consult Professor Van Helsing. Her condition is serious. I blame myself. Doctor? I don't want to alarm you but has she any relatives? None. But she's engaged quite recently to a young barrister, Quincy Morris. Perhaps you should send him a telegram. Professor Van Helsing? No. I'm Dr. Seward. How do you do? My name is Quincy Morris. I'm Miss Westenra's fiancee. Oh. I see. Please come in. Take off your coat. I came as soon as I heard. I'm glad you came. We're doing our best but... I sn't there anything I can do for her? Yes, you can give her a transfusion of your blood. Come. I'm Professor Van Helsing. Quincy Morris. Now I think she has a chance. We just have to wait and see. (Whispering) Lucy. Lucy. Lucy. Lucy. Lucy. Lucy. Lucy. Lucy. Lucy. Lucy. Lucy. Lucy! (Screarming) (Crying) Ah! What are you doing here? I'm afraid you're not allowed in this part of the house. Come along. Come on. Professor, you must do something. You can't let her die through ignorance. Ignorant? Perhaps my dear I'm not so much ignorant as afraid of admitting my own suspicions. (Man screarming) The man whose voice you hear was once as sane as you or I. He had a daughter. Young and beautiful. Together they were traveling in Transylvania. They stopped in a town called Bistritz. One night the girl was found unconscious in her bed. Half dead frorm loss of blood. Day by day. Like the fly who is the spider s prey. She grew weaker. The father watched and waited by her bedside til one night when she was close to her end the neighbors hear d a terrible shriek. They found the daughter dead and the father as he is now. True. There is some similarity in the case but that is no explanation. Perhaps not, that you see. All my life I've made a study of what some people call the black arts. That's why Renfield was admitted to my care and also Jonathan Harker. The mountains in the north of Transylvania are rich in legend, yet behind the legend, behind the fantasy, there are certain facts. Occasionally a glimmer of the truth reaches us. Now I think that Jonathan has seen some of that truth. Then why didn't you believe what I told you about Count Dracula? Jonathan. Oh. Jonathan. I cannot tell you. I dare not. (Screarm) Lucy sweet. Now you drink this. (Door opening) Who's there? Who's there? (Screarm) Ah. (Crying) She's dead. She's dead. She's dead. But you are still alive. It is a sign. Perhaps it is not too late for me to act. I n my search for the secrets of the black arts. This is what I found. And what concerns us now. May I? "Known through legend in such diverse countries as Greece. Rome. France. I ndia and even China. He does fatten up on the blood of the living. He can by such nourishment even grow younger. He throws strange shadows when he walks upon the earth. He can transform himself to dog, to bat, to other kinds of beast. He lives by night for by day he must conceal himself within his grave. Those upon whom he nourishes himself sicken and die. And then become like him. Vampires themselves. His name is Dracula. " Why can't this man be arrested? You underestimate Count Dracula. What good are laws against someone who can set himself above the law? (Howling) His spirit is all around us. Some of us are completely within his power. Professor. You know so much about the black arts. Suppose you too are Dracula's servant? I have never met the Count. And yet I feel I... I know him better than my own soul. My ball's in the water. I'm going to tell mommy. Oh. Be careful. Hey, watch out. Ah. Good. Hey. Corme. Corme on over here. Come here. Come here. Good morning my dear. You have become not only a nurse but a servant. I shall miss you when you leave London. Thank you. How's Jonathan this morning? Much better. Good, good. I think it helped him beyond measure being able to tell you his story and to know that however fantastic you were prepared to admit it to be true. I ndeed, I only wish it weren't because you... great heavens. Just as I feared. A child found dead. Where? Near here. Near the church. Last night. Yes. Ah, gentlemen, I shall need your help. Whatever we can do. Come. Sit down. I shall want you to accompany me this evening. We're going to visit Miss Lucy Westenra's grave. Listen Van Helsing, as I told you this afternoon, I'm not afraid of any danger, but this is... What if I tell you you may be saving the lives of scores of other children? You mean Count Dracula may be hiding here? Worse than that. Far worse. The nice and innocent girl you loved. You're mad! Lucy, a killer of children? Be brave. Before the night is out if her spirit is to be saved you must obey me absolutely. One o'clock. Open it. So far I'm right. Another few minutes. Look, it'll soon be light. It won't be long now. Remember what I told you. Now. Your spade, and do as I say. Open it. Use your spade, man! Renfield. Relax. Please relax. Renfield. Relax. Please relax. It's passed. All right, Renfield, it's passed. Look at me. Can you understand me? Renfield. look at me. Can you understand me? My God, you can. Whatever your sickness was, it's passed. Now then. Tell me what you know. Come on. Tell me what you know. I... Tell me. Go on. That's it. I... Tell me. Go on. It... Yes. Whether by accident or design, it would appear our foe is closer than we thought. It's my fault Professor. I never thought to connect the property bought by the Count with this place. But those cases we saw delivered? Those must've been the same cases I saw in vaults beneath Count Dracula's castle. He used them to transport himself to England. And now they provide his hiding place by day, whilst at night... (Clock chirming) If we're going to find him we must hurry. Oh. Jonathan. Don't worry. This time I've come prepared. I have two better weapons. Take these. Against them Count Dracula is powerless. Are we ready? Then let's go. Professor? Professor. I should like to talk to this man. Renfield. He could be the key to Count Dracula. Very well, you may see him, but not alone. He may reveal more to you than to us. Take this young lady to Renfield. Do as I say. Here take this. Look. A case must have stood here. Maybe we're too late. (Screeching) Watch out. (Thunder) (Anirmal noises) (Gunshots) (Anirmal noises) (Thunder) I know how you've tried to help. Perhaps, perhaps you could tell us more. Kill. (Anirmal noises) We must sanctify this place as Professor Van Helsing told us. I'd like to see you find your way out of that my lad. (Singing) Evening your honor. Care for a little fun? That man. It looked like the Count. But younger, much younger. Your eyes are playing tricks. They're waiting for us. Come on. Come on. Mr. Harker and Mr. Morris. I want you to meet my good friend the Home Secretary. Good evening. Good evening. Good evening, sir. Thank you for receiving us, sir. For a moment the other night we thought the Professor was, as the American's say, a goner. A slight stroke but although my legs are a little uncertain I trust my intellect is not a goner. A watch is now being kept on every means of exit from the country. A description of the wooden case in which we believe. So the Professor tells me. The Count may be concealing himself, has been circulated to... Some news perhaps? I don't understand. It's from Mina. Something about the Opera and a ticket. You let her leave the house without an escort? I sent no ticket. Your Excellency, we shall have to act at once. This may be the work of Dracula himself. (Singing) Look. A doctor! Someone call a doctor! For God's sake. Is there a doctor here! And then they thought that I'd had enough. You. What do you want? Your master quickly. Quickly! You are the captain of the Tzarina Catherine? I am. You sail for the mouth of the Danube one the morning tide? What if I do? You have some cargo and a passenger. Where is he? Myself to Varna. We do not go to Varna. To Varna. What is it? What happened Renfield? Varna. Varna? Varna. Yes. Here it is. It's a small port on the Black Sea. I've got it. Look. He could travel from there to Transylvania. But with a load like that it would take him three weeks. You could get to the castle first. In one week. Sanctify every grave, leave it barren. And useless as a refuge, before he arrives. If we go, what about Mina. I shall guard her with my life. Renfield? Dead. (Door opening) (Foot steps) Who is there? You. All my life I've studied the black arts. It's strange to finally confront the Prince of Darkness himself. You have learned much. You can do nothing. Come along, hurry. (Harmrmering) (Groaning) (Screarming) (Screarm) (Praying) Now then. There's only one task left, to find Dracula himself. I s there any news? Not yet. Tell me Professor. If the Count is on his way home, what have we to fear? Mina, my dear, whilst the Count lives. Time and space have little meaning. We can only pray. (Screarming)
