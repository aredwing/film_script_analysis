Why is everyone scared of me and running away? What mistake did I do? Hey! You didnt find anyone elses companionship? Didnt find anyone elses companionship? Had my mother asked me this question in my childhood... ...I wouldnt be in this situation Dont you understand? The reason for this condition of mine  My friends! Want to know how? Come, Ill show you. His name is Kalyana Sundaram. Hes the most sluggish person one can ever see. You get it now? Lazy sloth! His name is Kanagasabapathy. If we say something... ...he misunderstands for something else. Watch now Idlies are in the vessel. Keep them in the carrier and take it. Hey, my cycle is punctured. Shall I come with you? - Dont lie! - No How can cycle get punctured? Only cycle tyres can get punctured, right? He is Venki. Another member in our wolf pack. Idiot, cant you see? Sorry, uncle. He is scared of others... ..his fear scares others Thats his specialty. Uh, oh, old lady! Wondering who this is? Look at the hype! Its me. Oops, no! I got this scar on that day. More than the pain here, it hurt more here. Here he is. His name is Pattabhi. Wondering where he is going? He started to school, but he is going somewhere else. - Hey Pattabhi. - Huh? - Where are you going? - Oh no! In our friendship, there were more mishaps than good This is one of the mishaps. 39 marks. Useless. Fail. Hey, why are you crying? I failed by one mark How will I show it to my dad? Dont worry, man. All of us have got only 39. Now look how Im going to pass. - Sir - What? - Total mistake, sir. - Total mistake? Youve passed is it? Here, hold. You beat me hastily, sir. Forgive me, son. Why dont you beat me in return? Its okay. Come on. Whoever commits a mistake must be punished. Go! I passed, I passed! We dont know to pass is it? Watch now. Hey! Hey! Dont do this, please. Sir, total mistake, sir. Total mistake for you too? How come its 129? Sir? Show me your hand. Cheat! Cheat! Lies. Body full of lies. Fraudulence at this young age. You are trying to cheat me? Hey! Hey! Come here! Total mistake for you as well? 1109!? Enough? Youve added marks of your body size? Fraud gang! Come out, all you guys. Come fast. Dear, why have you corrected in blue ink? Vasu refused to give me his red ink pen, sir. You beat me hastily, sir. Forgive me, son. Why dont you beat me in return? Shame! Shes Gayathri. My first love! Inspired by Kadhalukku Mariyadhai movie, ...we exchanged glances in love. Sweet memories. Then one day Vasudeva, take your bags and go to Section A Classroom. Like a lion that disbands a herd, Tamil sir split us and allotted different classrooms. Hey Pattabhi, why are you getting up? This is your classroom. Even though all of us were sad, I was glad Because, Gayathri was in my class now. Hes Cheenu bro, our role model. We fancied his dressing style, hairstyle We learnt the true meaning of friendship from him. Because after 'Thalabathy' Rajini, 'Natpukkaga' Sarathkumar, 'Nadodigal' Sasikumar, hes the only person whod do anything for friends. Weve often fought to decide who among us is Cheenu. Theres a twist in every story. But the twist in this story was in Cheenu bros mouth. Hey, Cheenu... what's with the beard? On a pilgrimage? Bro, please Lifes dreadful. What happened, Cheenu? Any love failure? Friendship failure! Friendship failure? Whats that? Yes, bro. My friends and I were all happily roaming and having fun. But now everyone has settled down with family and children. Now, Im all alone. Its about time you get married as well, right? Bro, marriage concept is a waste. Friendship is the best, bro. To be friends forever, you should never get married, bro. He jabbered as his mouth was free, but these guys saw through a zoom lens! To be friends forever, you should never get married, bro. Yes, Cheenu. Before marriage, my friends and I were always together Then came a wife We all got separated. Hey, so if we get married we would also get separated? Looks like it, man. Then, we should never get married Yes... Yes Then all of you promise that you wont get married. Promise! Promise! Vasu, promise us. Hey, my finger is hurt, dude. Its okay, use the other hand. Ma, weve got a gift for you. My dear son, Arjuna, Im too old for gifts. As usual, you five sons can share it equally among yourselves. Ma! You have to see what weve brought You should never be separated Therefore, you five sons should always share everything equally. Its this mothers order. We will get separated only if we marry five giris right? What if we all marry the same girl? Hey, that wont work! - Its a super idea! - Thanks. But Im already in love with a girl called Gayathri. Oh no, what to do now? Okay, lets all get married to Gayathri. Shes my relative. Shes very pretty. So let's propose to her tomorrow itself then. Hey, not that girl, please. Lets see someone else. No way! Were going tomorrow... Getting five roses Proposing to her and taking her with us. Lets go, guys. Please leave me. Whats it Vasu? Tell me. I love you, Gayathri! Vasu! Whats this? Rose, Gayathri. Vasu, this is not nice. Check if my rose is nice, Gayathri. Vasu, I thought you were a nice guy But, look what youve done. No, Gayathri. Weve decided to marry the same girl, so... So? So, all five us will marry you, Gayathri. Get lost, you retards. Hey, you get lost. Gayathri, please dont go. Gayathri! This is the college where I studied. My second innings. Ive grown up. But these guys never grew! Blow out love and lust, Together, let's celebrate friendship. Buddy, can we revert our promises? Hmmm, no. Lets love just once? Hmmm, no. Would you take a cup of acid Add ice to it and drink? Would you climb an electric transformer and lie down? Would you take a board that says goat And go to a butchers shop? Finished! Lifes finished if you fall in love. Love makes me feel like a winged white elephant. Love makes me feel like a cloud thats trapped in a flower. If you ask me why we need love, Ill ask you why we need breath. We dont need air, just love is enough. This is Pattabhis slippers! Finished! Lifes finished if you fall in love. Teacher! Look, shes showing. They were friends for a long time Now, they are fighting for a girl. If theres no sky, theres no soul. If theres no love, theres no Tamil cinema. Whats with these guys? When in love, broccoli would turn into a rose. Hey, Vasu. Drop her at home. Why are you sending your girl with him? Hey, hes gay. Guys, weve become famous. Look at the response. Entire college is laughing at us. Forget college. Even the watchman himself is laughing at us. Were hep. Lets use this opportunity in the college elections and become chairman. hairman is very low. Aim for something bigger. - Spiderman! - Super, dude. Then, youre superman. Youre He-man. - What about me? - Youre waste man. Shut up, guys. Everyone is saying were gay Spiderman and Superman it seems Just get lost, guys. What's he saying? Guys, we must do something for Vasu. Would you enter a lions mouth and say Howre you? Guys, what did you do? Everyone is scared of me Giris are shying away Nothing, dude. Senior Shiva asked you to drop his girl right?... We spread a rumour that you slept with her Thats why so many fans for you. Jerks, youve ruined everything. Finished! Lifes finished if you fall in love. Go away, man. I have so much work than to chat with you. Hey, Vasu! Its been a year since college got over. What are you still doing here? After all these events, wondering why I need to be friends with them? Absolutely no reason. Being a Friend is reason enough to be friends right? Yes, theres no reason needed for a good friendship. If theres any reason, then it isnt friendship! Kappal But if I continue to roam with these guys here... I'll have to live and die as a bachelor! You cannot become a Vivekananda or an Abdul Kalam, Vasu! You'll either become a sage or a church priest But can never father a child. Have to decide something about this soon. Hey, you missed an awesome match Vasu, why didnt you come to play? Hey kids come here. Take chocolates. Chocolates for what? Ive got a job in Chennai and I have to leave tomorrow. What? Where are you all going? Why did you take this decisin? I didnt. It came on its own. We didnt apply anywhere. How did you alone get? Maybe college was impressed with me and they recommended? Show that... What does it say, buddy? Whats this? It says Indu Prints, Mayiladudurai Oh man, I did everything spot-on but left a very glaring clue. Is that what it reads? Maybe the company came here to print it? Fraud! Betrayer! Are you a friend? You printed it in our town and lying to us? Why this pettiness? Youre tired of our friendship right? You couldve taken a knife and killed us. Selfish! You're caught red-handed, Vasu. How will you manage? What are you thinking? Turn! What? Dust in your eyes? Im crying, dude. I didnt do this for me. I did this for our policy. Not getting it. Yes, my dad has seen a suitable girl for me. You wont believe, the girl is from a rich family. They want me to settle down in their house. If Im here, my dad will definitely get me married. Then Ill have to get separated from you forever. Howll I live without you? I know this will sadden you guys, that's why I lied. Now, tell me. Did I do anything wrong? Even if you go to Chennai, youll be separated from us, right? Thats only until the girl gets married to someone else Then Ill come back and settle with you guys. You guys hurt me by saying words like betrayer and fraud. Then you couldve printed five letters right? We wouldve come with you. Thats not a problem But I didnt want to disappoint you with a fake offer. Im going to Chennai tomorrow and Ill find a job for all of us. hen Ill come and take you all. Believe me, guys. - Here, take this chips and biscuit. - Hey, its okay. Arrange a job for us soon. Thats the reason Im going. You guys leave, Ill take care. Please come. Chennai? Yes and you? Hey, go and sit at the back. Go! These guys are pests. Okay, dude. Ill call you once I reach. They are going to start the bus. You leave. Vasu? Vasu! Hey guys, Im here. Bus reversed. Okay, take care please. Okay you guys leave and take care. Ill go and immediately start my work. Hey, whats this chain for? Its okay. Give. Hey, don't forget our policy, Vasu. - Nelson sir? - Hmmm. Counsellor Kalimuthu sent me from Mayiladudurai. Im Vasu. I saw the face cut and knew shes my mother. Lets play mangatha. Ugh, some figure is calling Sir, Radhika is calling. Sir, Radhika is calling. - Hi baby! Hi darling, where are you? Im at my home, getting ready for my day's work. Sweetie, can we meet today? Are you free? Uh, no! no! Not now. By this evening 07:00 P.M. is okay. - Okay? - Okay! - Love you. - Love you. What a stud! Sir sir! Poornis phone sir. Put it on silent. This is Juli No. 2 After this, only tomorrow its commitment time. Go Go. Looks like spoilt milk. - Like to eat? - No, its okay. Sir, theres a message from Poorni. Read. - Sir, how can I? - I said, read - Hey, dog - Hmmm Youve left your shirt here. Send a message stating I will come and collect it tomorrow. And yeah, which company are you joining? I need to look out for something, sir. Oh, that category is it? Okay, you can use my bike. Its okay, sir. What about you then? I have two, dude.No problem. Very gifted. He has two in everything. One for three? - Hello! - Hey Vasu? Tell me, buddy. Got the job? Look for something that suits my range! Im going from one company to another. Okay, Ill talk to you later. Bye Bye! Sigh, companies wont work. Should check out colleges. Rascal! Why is the bike not moving? ugh college giris are also taken is it? Shes standing alone. I must pick her up Wherever I might wander; In your shadow, I'd take a breather. Even if death comes by, I'd receive with flowers and rest on you forever! Hey, have you eaten, dude? This is Vasu, from my hometown, dear. Oh! Hi, Vasu. Dont give such hugs, then hell come behind us. No, man. Hes such a nice guy. Hes slept. Okay, slowly Go home. Drive safely. Okay, see you tomorrow. Hey, country fellow. Enough of your acting. Get up. Sir You drink right? No, sir. I drink only beer though. Only beer? Beer is holy is it? Its become a habit since childhood, sir. Oh god. O- p-e-n-e-r Did you get any job? Actually, I didnt come searching for a job, sir. Then what? Any problem in town? No, sir. - Financial issue? - No, sir. - Love failure? - Not that, sir. Your family is forcing you to get married? No, sir. If its none of these, then why did you come, man? Actually, I ran away from my friends, sir. What are you saying, man? Yes, sir I was prohibited from giris, as marriage would spoil friendship, sir. I dont even know the scent of a girl, sir. - Then, so far..? hmmm? - No. Sigh, very sad. Thats why I came to Chennai to date a girl, sir. Its okay. Its been two days in the city now. By now, you couldve befriended many giris. There isnt a single IT company, college or a school Ive not been to. Even 10 or 12 year old giris are already taken. But nothing seems to work right for me, sir. I hope you wont mistake me if I ask you something. Go ahead You look very average when compared to me. But even you have two girlfriends! Ive wasted my entire life, sir. Hey, dont feel much. To impress a girl, age is not important... ...strategy is important. What does that mean, sir? Giris who work for IT companies are from middle class. They focus only on rich guys. And for college giris, competition is very high Then what shall I do, sir? Shall I go back to my town? No, no, no. Hereafter, you should target only rich giris. Have you ever noticed giris who come in a BMW or an Audi? You may not have noticed. You would have left it thinking it is out of your league. But only for those giris,expectation is very low. Touch them, and they will fall for you! Language and communication is very important. Here, most people who speak in English dont know its grammar. So, right or wrong, communicate in English. Not one, but ten giris will follow you. I shouldve met you 25 years ago, sir. Its okay. Heres a pub entry coupon. Youd find colourful chicks there. Pick somebody of your taste. Enjoy your life. Sorry, sir. Only couples allowed. First you allow me in. I come with couples. You can speak in Tamil. You let me in first, and Ill come as a couple. Rule is that you must come with a female. You let me in, Ill come with a female. No. It's unfair, what if we dont have a girlfriend? It doesnt matter if a guy who is single is alive or dead. Give me some peanut fries.. Bro, didnt they let you in? Um, no I came to buy some side dish. Ill give you some peanuts, can you come inside with me? - Hey, whos that - Funny guy Hey, Vasanth. What happened? Get up dude. Come on. Wait, wait. Let me come. Hes mixed multiple drinks together. They say sticking to the same brand prevents headache. Arent you coming inside? Hes drunk.

Ill make you jobless, if you dont. Security! Whats happening? No idea madam, but hes quarreling to meet you. Me? Ask him who he is. I asked, madam. He says hes your boyfriend. Deepika! Deepika! Where did you go? You know what he did to me? Who are you? What do you want? Deepika! I, Vasu Excuse me! Seriously, I dont know who you are. I think youve come to the wrong address. You dont remember? Im Vasu. Get out! You dont remember? You bought many drinks for me. You hugged me and kissed me. Im trapped. She must be the 'Memento' man's sister. Shes forgotten everything Ah, its him Hello! Hi buddy, where are you? Im at office, man. Have you got settled in a job? Its quite difficult. Ive started looking only from yesterday... ...it will set soon. Dont stress, buddy. If it doesnt work, look for something else. Hey, text me your address. CEO is staring at me, Ill call you back. Buddy, address? Its okay. I had tea and came back. What the hell does he think of himself? Hello, what do you want? Why are you sitting here? Don't you remember who I am? Look, you helped me at the pub so I was friendly to you. Dont come home and disturb like this. - What about our love? - What? Love? You said, I love you. - Are you new to the city? - Yeah, how did you find out? Then what? Youve taken friendly comments on a serious note. Friendly? But you told the pub guard that Im your guy. That was again on a friendly note. Friendly note, huh? Bro! This is my girl. Is it? Perfect match! When is the wedding? You saw? The word My guy indicates lover. Huh! Okay. I told so by mistake. Sorry! Hereafter, dont disturb me. Please leave. Dear, we slept together last night. What? When? How? Got scared? I lied. You believed me right? April fool! She slapped you? Why are you laughing, sir? Is that a big deal? Theres a box under my bed. Go and bring it. This is the one. Give. Theyre all my assets. You know who she is? Poornima! She did this to me in the middle of Nandanam area signal. Idiot! Theres another box under the computer table. Bring that. Go, dude. - You know who he is? - Sir? Radhikas ex-boyfriend. Hey, hes taken away my girl. You can get slippered to finally get a nice girl. You are a complete waste. Shes our family friend and yet you cant win her heart? What can I do, dad? She keeps avoiding me if I get close to her. Its not enough to get closer, you need to impress her. Giris are not simple. You need to find out what she likes and do some serious thinking. You shouldnt bug her in the name of trying. Ive tried a lot. She doesnt seem to budge. Hes your friend right? You can directly ask him right?... Why are you pestering me? If I ask him, hell simply point to his daughter's opinion! If she declines, everything will be wasted. Then tell me about some other girl. She wont work out. Fool! Its all business. We need to look at improving our business. Think. Think well about how to get her. By the time you think, another guy will get her! Hi, whats up? Are you going to hunt? Hey, wont you understand? Why are you following me now? - Can I get some venison? - What? Then what? That love matter Are you mad or something? That slap isnt enough? Oh, that day you slapped me when I wasnt aware.

Here, this side Hit me Why are you torturing me? You didnt get any other girl in this city? No, I didnt get! Only you put your arms around me and said Im your guy. Said I love you and got me drinks.

Ive hunted some chameleons in my village. Please consider. Oops, its gone You could join a tribal group and get trained. Not a single right shot! Are you going to get ready or not? No, I wont. Ill tear you apart if you dont, rascal. Dont keep yelling at our son always. You drink this milk, dear. I dont want to get married now. You wont listen to me this way. Youll hit me?

Hey, the girl has gone inside. How will you tell now? What, my son-in-law? Do you like the girl? I dont like her. What did you say? You dont like the girl? What happened, dear groom? You arent saying anything I want to talk separately to the girl. Go and talk! All yours! Dont keep dragging, okay? Just tell her that you like her sister instead. But she doesnt have a sister. Then say you like her mother! What is he doing inside? So long to say that he doesnt like her? Wait, let me peep through the window. Dont touch my savoury, okay? Oh my god! What have you done? Is this why we came here for? He cheated and went away from us! What are you saying? Hey Venky, open the door. Look what he is doing. - What are you doing? Leave her. - No, I wont leave her. - Leave her. - No, I wont. Groom is in a hurry! Lets have the wedding on the next auspicious day. The half-crazy guy. Oh god. Hey, darling!

I dont know if she is interested in business now. Lets see. Any marriage proposals? Any idea about that? - What is it? - Nothing, just asked. Its okay. Tell me. Abhay is interested in Deepika it seems. Why dont we marry them away? Im also interested Ill be very happy if your daughter becomes my daughter-in-law. She appears to be very uninterested in these things now. Give me some time. Let me talk to her. If she agrees, then let them marry. Who is Vasu here? Why are you dumbstruck? Vasu? Come in He is inside. Please come. - Sit down. Sir is taking bath. - Ask him to come soon. Ill get some tea/coffee, sir. Full of weird stuff... so... Full of weird stuff... so... Sir, who are you?

Why dont you stay for some ten days and then leave? Oh Okay, fine! My lord, this accused Vasu has betrayed his friends. He has broken his promise to never get into a relationship. His roommate Nelson had given some crappy ideas... ...and nurtured venom in his sweet little heart. Objection, my lord! I accuse them for suppressing this young man... ...from losing his virginity for the past ten years. They have prevented him from plucking romantic flowers from his garden. What poo is that? Kushboo? No, my lord. It's a divine flower. His roommate Nelson plucked the flower and taught Vasu to perform his puja. His roommate Nelson plucked the flower and taught Vasu to perform his puja. He must have plucked his garden's flower, your honour. Maybe, his flowers are dried and dead. I wouldnt even consider that this is a court. Id pour hot water on his face. If hes so determined, ask him to pluck his flower and prove to us. Here, pluck off! Order, order, order! Order is done, your honor. Mutton biryani for lunch. Proceed Therefore, Id suggest you declare that Vasu is innocent and may his friends who deprived him from the scent of a woman ...be sentenced for life. No, my lord. Thats not possible in the eyes of law! What, Mr. Vasu? Did you betray your friends? - Did you have an affair? - Yes. As Vasu himself accepted his crime and as his lawers defence was extremely stupid Vasu is fined Rs. 500, ...and Nelson who has provoked Vasu shall therefore be hung to death. My lord, this is not a judgment We shouldnt hide this any longer. Need to inform Vasu about this. Hey, Vasu. Your friends have found out about your love affair, dude. They are pretending so you better be careful. Deepika, my leg hurts. How long should I stand? Keep standing like that for half an hour more. Thats your punishment. Is this why I came running to see you this morning? Then? You thought Id hug and kiss you? Yeah right! - What? - Nothing Look at his face Its very hot. Ufff You bloody cheat! Flirt! You succeeded. - Filter coffee? - No, its Bru. Go away! - Deepika! - Mickey mouse - Hi Abhay. - Who is this? - Guess who! - How do I know? - Guess now. - Brother? - Now? - Friend? Now? But, Deepika Im in love with you. You know right? What are you saying, Abhay? You couldve told me earlier right? Id have broken up with him. Its okay. Break up with him now.

If you tell them about us would they eat you? Tell me. If you won't tell them, then I will. I cant continue this game of hide and seek. You just tell them, Vasu. Love is a common thing. Even they might fall in love, some day. They would never fall in love. What? Why? Then all of you promise that you wont get married. Promise! Promise! Vasu, promise us. Hey, my finger is hurt, dude. Its okay, use the other hand. Oh! So youre that kind? You find this funny? No, I actually pity you. It isn't a big deal to get serious about. You have no idea about them.

No. Ive promised her that I will marry her. Please. Then what about the promise you made to us? Shes more important to you than us? Nothing like that. Why did you break the promise? Why are you still hanging to it? How's friendship and marriage connected anyway? You'd be able to roam with us? Drink with us? How about a night show cinema? Sharing the same blanket? Eat midnight parottas at TPS? Or eat early morning pongal at Iyappans? Is pongal a big deal? Ill ask her to cook for you, man. Is this a mortgage deal? This is marriage.

This will continue the same way after our marriage. It's better we stay away. This is new to them. Let's make them understand. You cant abandon them on the road. Stop the car. I wont stop.

She must have called the police. I told you, this love would create problems. See for yourself. You decide whether you want her or us. They are doing this intentionally. Please listen to me. You did the same thing to me, Deepika. You called the police, you arranged for rowdies. Oh, Vasu. That was long back. You were a stranger. Thats how anybody would have done. Dont relate both. Are you coming or not? - Stop, Vasu. - Hey, leave him. Come! Hey, Vasu. How can you do that to a girl? Go now. I dont need her or her stupid love. Shes very arrogant! Deepika, dont cry.
