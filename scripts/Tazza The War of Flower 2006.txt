Stop talking about Mu-seok. He'll get what's coming to him. You've done your revenge. Now let's move on. I didn't go there to see Mu-seok. Then who? KWAK? Someone higher up. Really? What for? Who are you? I'm from the warehouse. The guy driven to the edge... I want to learn from you. My name is... Show me your palm. Don't take up hwatu. You'll most likely end up dead in the streets. I need to pay my sister back. I won't leave till you say yes! You'd be better off doing drugs. Hwatu is a sad drama. It's best not to know about it. They say knowledge is power. You talk like a politician. Are you comparing me to those bastards? - You. - Yes? Want to get beaten up by that man? Yes. Do I have to? There's never a reason to anything. Oh no! There's a huge fight going on! I'd better call the cops. It doesn't always pay to be a good citizen. Wait! Wait! - Will you teach me now? - Can you kill a man? What? You got beaten up pretty bad First rule of gambling. Become a beast. - Let's go. - You're leaving, sir? - I'm tired. What's that kid doing these days? He'll probably give up in a couple of days. I see. Let's go. You gotta use your head! Are you going to hate me for this later? No. I can tell you will. It's written on your face. Nothing's written on my face Come in. I shuffle, then I break the cards like this. You do it all by yourself? Let's say you're my prey. I take a card from the bottom to hand out to you, while I take the cards from the top. I have an eight pair. You have a 10 and a 9. You only have a nine points. So you're saying I'll have a nine? Yes. Wait. How did you...? What? How did you do that? Your hands must be faster than the eye. What cards do you want? A one pair. Abracadabra. Abracadabra! - You want to make money? - Yes. - You want to be rich? - Yes! Here you go. Cut. Cut. Four cards. I give up. I have pair. I'm going to get good at this. Are you the best gambler in this country? You bet I am. You laugh? There are 3 top high rollers in Korea. One Ear of Kyeongsang Province. Agwee of Jeolla Province. And me. The best one. One Ear and Agwee had a game once. Agwee cut off one of his ears. That's why he's called One Ear. Have you played against Agwee? You know what his wish is? He doesn't wish for world peace. All he wants is my wrist. But he hasn't gotten it yet. He's still after me. Let me tell you something. I'm a man, who made hwatu into an art form. Let the cards become one with you. It's like cheating, but with more soul. If you're so good, why do you live in a place like this? I've been unlucky in buying up real estate. I can see the card. Hide it well. Get back to practice! I'll do it later. Don't talk back to me! Old man. I mastered one trick! Get back to work! Mop the floors! I can't enjoy a moment of peace with this boy! The bridge collapsed? What's happening to this world? You think all is fair and beautiful in this world? Isn't that the way it should be? If it were, how would people like us make a living? Go back to work! When a department collapsed a year later, Goni was no longer surprised. When spring came, Goni began traveling the country with Mr. PYEONG. Pohang Call it at 40 million won. It's cold. Close the door. Eight points? It looks like I've won. Officer LEE.

You're leaving them half of the money? Those people need to live, too. Third rule. Don't be too selfish. But you told me to be a beast. Will you stop asking questions? Just go with the flow. And stop calling me Dad. What else can I call you? Call me Uncle instead. Alright. Uncle, Why don't we play a game of sotda? The traditional way? Or by using tricks? I can't win with tricks Let's do it the traditional way. Who goes first? I do. We were always careful not to make noise while screwing women back in the day. Those people seem not to care. - I bet 10 million. - You want to end it now? You scared? No. I see your 10 million. - 10 pairs? - Yes. I've only got a 9 pair. You're going to quit after you get your sister's money? I'll have to make five times as much. Will you promise to cut your finger if you can't quit? Sure. Good. Let's go to Busan. Who are we meeting this time? Ever heard of the Flower of Gambling? Busan Someone's here to see you. Tell him to wait. Tell him to come inside. Just go in through that door. Why haven't you been in to see me? Hold on. I'll call you back. How have you been? Well. I've been living the lonely life. Why did you ask to see me? I missed you. You're a good liar. Let's talk business. He's a retired army general. He's quite a gambler. He's got a lot of cash. He's got no skills, but he's good. Who's he? Your bodyguard? He'll be playing tomorrow. Is he that good? Can't you tell? - He looks too soft. - You're wrong. He challenged me to a game, and he played me by giving me a 9 pair. Who? Me? I could tell you were cheating. You really are good. Okay. Let's see. What color are my nails? Red. But your hands are too soft. You probably can't play cards. - He's good. - You have no idea. Let's review. Shall we? If I rub my nose? Fold. If I touch my lips? - Raise the money! If I rub my shoulder? Show off my panties. You haven't changed a bit. People don't change. If I touch my stomach? Double. My knee? Triple. Look at those flowers. What do those look like to you? Sakura. Three pair. You're getting good at this. You're not going out for a drink? I don't feel like it. Why don't we... Why don't we what? Have a drink? Hold on. I don't care for drinks. Don't be so rough. Take your time. Your lips are like a wet rose. That's sweet. Sweet? You think I'm sweet? Mr. PYEONG? I'd like to erase him from my memory. You slept with him? You have to be joking. - Want to make some dough? - Always. You'll get your wish if you work for me. What about Mr. PYEONG? He used to be good, but he's long past his prime. You'll get to ride a Beemer if you work for me. A Beemer? What's that? Want a watch? Be careful when playing against the general. He's very calm. Conservative. What should I do? He's a man who hates to lose. Toy with his mind. I get him all excited? Let's start. Let's start with 2 million. You're not lucky today, General. Sometimes you win, sometimes you lose. Let's go with 5 million. Start the game! Lalalalalala Stop singing. Does it bother you? What's wrong with singing? I won't look at my cards. I bet 30. Here. Whatever. I bet thirty more. I fold. I fold. I need 20 more. Do you accept collateral? Sure. Want to bet your house? Stay right here. A .38 caliber Smith & Wessen. What do you say? Sure. Toss it on top. Seven pair. What do you have? Wow! I can't believe I won! Don't move. - Go to the second floor. - Yes, sir. - Wait five minutes. - Bullet, too? At that moment, I realized what it was I felt for Goni. I wanted to make him mine. The man came back in just 3 minutes. Just like I knew he would. I can't let you leave with my money. Bring the boys... Don't make a sound. Don't even move a finger. What are you doing? It's always the guys you trust who stab you in the back. You don't think it was fun to have a guy on the inside? I don't gamble for fun. Goni? Give me that revolver. People like us must stay away from things like this. You have to go home to your mother now. Don't go, Goni. Aren't you coming? I'm coming. Cut off your finger. What? I can tell you won't quit. Cut is off. Cut it off. And let's go home. What happened? Lost some money on hwatu? You can't cut that off. Want to bet? Get out of here. Someone will do the job for you when the time comes. Who do you think you are? You want my name? Wait a minute. Why am I doing this? I've been thinking. You didn't cut it off? Well... No... We don't know if I'll go back to gambling yet. You still alive? Don't worry. I'll die one day. I still have unfinished business with you. One day, we'll get to finish it. Scared? Who is he? Agwee. Agwee? Why didn't you cut it off? Ah, well... Um... This is the only way I know how to make money. Besides, I need to at least get behind the wheel. Take charge of my life. Oh. My bag. Go. Madam JEONG is a pretty knife. Be careful when wielding her. Last rule. There are no friends for life, just as there are no enemies for life. This car's fantastic, but it'll be too cold for the winter. Shake it. Get used to the taste. Here's your share. What are you going to do with that money? It's a secret. Seven. All I need is a seven! Would you look at that? Seven pair! What a lucky! You're taking everything! I've saved this for months. We're about to lose all we have! We should get out of here before we go bankrupt. What's this for? Put in a good word for me to Madam JEONG. You need more practice. Is he Madam JEONG's new bitch? Learn to be humble, boy! Thanks for the advice. - Thank you! - Your welcome! Take it easy. - Thanks. - Be careful... Yeah. Why did you go there yesterday? Where? To the U.S. army base. I was just bored. I was looking for a high roller. There was none. I told you not to get mixed up with other games. You won't get a job if you whore yourself out. Don't worry, Ma'am. You and I both know I need a job. Let's go to work. This is going to be a big game. Wear the other jacket. You look good in cobalt blue. Is that a fact, Ma'am? Stop it. How does a professor have so much money? It's his kid's hospital bill. I fold. I take 5 million won.

I'll kill you if I see you back here. Thank you! - You want to win this time? - Yes! Good luck! Not even God can stop him. Don't bother, you and I both went through that. You went through that, too? Tell me about your past. I'd rather tell you my weight. Then tell me your weight! - Yes? - Tell me. - It's for you. - Me? Hello? - Let go of me! Let go! - You're bleeding! Let go! Bring Agwee to me. Please! You don't know it was him! I won't let you go near him! Fine. I'll look for him myself! Everyone he plays against ends up dead! You think I'll end up dead? That's when I realized... something wrong... One day, Goni could leave me. When did you last see Agwee? Dugye Station. He was going from Dugye to Yeosu. Mr. PYEONG was headed for Namwon. What about Agwee? I'll look into this. It'll cost 20 million won. - I'll give it to you. - No. I will. I don't care who gives it to me. Who should I call once I find Agwee? Me.

What's the matter? I'm just in this for fun! What do you say? Ten mil. I fold. You're in? You want in? Are you sure about that? I'm just sorry. Let's see who wins then. I got a two pair! I win. Right? Four pair? What happened here? - Open the door. - I thought we had a deal. Someone filed a complaint. We need to take you in. I went to college. I can't go to the slammer! I'm really sorry about this. Open that door! Sir! Sir! Take me with you! Stop there! Get down from there! Wait! Wait, wait, tell me. Where are we going? I liked you from the start. I don't usually do that. You know why I need a bodyguard? Be quiet. I don't know if I should tell you this. Tell me what? Don't tell anyone. I'm a pro. What? - A pro! - A pro? - What kind of pro? - Look. What do you say? Oh. That? Where are you from? - Namwon. - Namwon? I knew I saw you from somewhere! I swore I knew you. We're from the same hometown! Nice to meet you! Damn... - Hey! Wait! - Go home! Wait up! I think we can really get along. Both of us got great skills. You and I can work together! We'll sweep the tables clean! We can get all the women we want! Not interested. You're missing out. I've got some good connections. - Shit. - Hold on. Do you think we can meet Agwee? Of course. If we're unlucky. I didn't know. I shouldn't have let him go to Seoul... If I had stopped him, we would have been happier. You're saying we can get Agwee if we get KWAK's money? Yeah. The two are close. You're starting to scare me. I told you my life is full of ups and downs. You should do something about that. That must be the police! We shouldn't open past midnight! - Hide, please! - Damn it. Why can't we drink past midnight? I don't understand it. Who's there? - I'm here with Mr. KWAK - Hwa-ran? - Hello. - Bring Hwa-ran to me. Sure. - Sing us a song, Mu-seok. - Yes, sir. Hwa-ran? He wants to see you. This is your fault. You borrowed money from him! You've gotten prettier. You can go outside. - May I take your order? - It's not the cops. What is it? - Is this about money? - We'll pay you back. You don't need to do that. Hwa-ran. He's had a bad day today. Because of some dumbs. There's a little boy inside him. I didn't know gangsters are like that. I'm not a gangster. I'm an honest citizen. I have a savings account. I'll bring out the liquor. Stop singing! Yes, sir. Hwa-ran, I know how to love. You're taking away my faith in love. I might do something bad if you don't listen to me. Sit down! Come on. - Have a seat. - What are you doing? - Have a seat. - No. Come on, Hwa-ran. Have a seat. Let go of me! How are you all tonight? Enjoy your drinks. We thought you were the cops. You two again? Don't forget to come back to see me. We could be a little busy. We'll be back in 2 weeks. Someone once said the beauty of life lies in gambling. - Wasn't that Baudelaire? - Charles Baudelaire. - Hwa-ran? Bring me the check. - Sure. Want to go see a movie tomorrow? Millions in My Account'? Sounds good. Yeah. You're a strange man. Everyone in this world is strange. - See you in two weeks. - Bring lots of cash. Good night. Keep singing. Mu-seok. - Yes, sir. - You sure you can beat him? Yes, sir. I'll kill you if you don't. I'll sing the song from the top. Bring out the liquor. How much do I miss you They're coming in a fancy car! What if it's stolen? - Se-ran. - They couldn't have stolen it. - Calm down. Se-ran! Are we going on a date? Or are we trying to get customers? We're trying to get customers. - Exactly. Then you can't tell him about you. What about me? That you have a kid. Why would I tell him that? Don't worry. Hey... I think I should tell you this now. To be honest, I have a son. He's five years old. What about his father? His father's dead. I wanted to give my son up for adoption. You can't bail like that. What about the kid? He could end up like me. That's why I'm raising him on my own. Good, good job. Good. - Want to make out? - Why? What do you mean why? We're both lonely folks. - We've barely met. - But we met last night. This is second time. You know me. - What? - I'm going to do it. I'm sorry. Did that hurt? - Let's go outside. - Where? - Come with me. - Where are we going? I need to get outside. I'm hot. - How much is the debt? - A lot. Should I pay it for you? Why would you do that? I got no place to put my money in. Hey. What did I say? Why are you mad at me? You and KWAK are the same. Enjoy the movie. - No. - Come on. - We can't. - Why not? - Wait. - It'll only take a second. I'm not that kind of woman. And I'm not that kind of man! I didn't know you're a gambler. - I'm going to quit. - You will? Of course! I always keep my word. - You promise to quit? - Of course! - You swear? - Sure. Oh, no! That must be Hwa-ran! Hide! - You're back so soon? - Yeah. What about your date? I dumped him. - You? - Me? I dumped him, too. Good. Did you see his hairstyle? It looked like a hen pecked at it. Men with bad hair don't know how to deal with women. Why did you leave your guy? Uh? Well... He's too full of himself. Daddy? What? Daddy? - I thought you liked him. - Go back to bed. - Daddy! - Daddy's right here. Hey, boy! - Mommy! Daddy's home! - What? - Were you having a dream? - What's going on? Hi there, Hwa-ran. Let's get it started. Their father made a fortune with his mining business. during the colonial period. But his sons ruined the family business. In the 80s, they recovered most of the money. How did they get ruined in the first place? Gambling. Tell him to pay with credit. - You got me? - Yes, sir. - What! - Hey! Lady! Look what you've done! I'm so sorry! This looks brand new. I'm sorry. - What are you going to do about it? - I'm sorry. Don't be so hard on her. Don't worry. This is waterproof. - And? - Ah. He's a proud man. Love sports. He's 52, but he likes it when you say he looks younger. Idiot. You could pass for a man in his 40s. I hear that all the time. Do you play golf? When did you get so good? You'll win this round, too. I hear you play cards these days. You can get back your money from there. - You gamble? - I've only done it once or twice. Men who like to gamble end up rich. - Isn't that right, Ye-rim? - I wouldn't know. He's got 10 billion won in real estate. Three buildings and 15 ships. Wow. He got money in the Saemangeum land. So he's got no cash up front? Good shot! That's a great shot! Hit it, Ye-rim. I think we're going to win. It looks like it. - What if I don't make it? - A shot like this? You'd be a fool to miss it. It's right next to the cup. Each acre will go for That's... - You missed? - How could you miss that? What's the matter with you? It was right next to the hole! That means you owe me 5 mil. - Let's have one more game. - Sure. They said it's going to rain soon. This sucks! Is money that important to you? This isn't about money. I just hate to lose. I see. I'm going to take a cab. Ye-rim! Ye-rim! Ye-rim! I'm really sorry. I've been horrible. No. It's my fault. You've given me new life. - Let's make this last. - Yes. OK. Tell him your husband is going to play hwatu tomorrow. Bring him along. Make him join the game. Make him win the first 2 days. Give them 60 million won. You'll bring him the money. Tell him to be careful. Make him do more. Get him a little confused, but not too much. I see. Let's get to it. Finish this up by this week. We have to leave soon. The money is drying up. When do we start work? We've already begun, help them. The gambler is here for his audition. Where? - Back at the hotel. - Okay. That'll be all. Send him away. I don't like his face. Bring Goni to me. Do you think we need him? He's got good looks. He asked Raccoon to look for PARK Mu-seok. You mean he's still in Seoul? Tell Raccoon I'm coming. Yes. I really should quit smoking. Life is tough, Goni. How much? Twenty? You're raising it again? Six pair. You win again? - This sucks. - Well... - Can someone start? - Where you going? - To pee. - No. You want to lose your mojo? You'll get unlucky. We can all go. Have fun. Hurry back. Turn on the music, so we can pee. He folded with a five pair? Will you shuffle these? I only have one hand. He doesn't seem to have much skills. Who is this guy? I'll give him a low score. Let's start with 10 mil. I'm so excited. Because of Goni? You interested in him? I'm flattered. - You are? - Right? I see you. I raise you 50. You're dead. I have about 100 million. Should I toss it in? Sure. I've got a lousy 8 points. Seven pair. Give this money to the manager! And write it down in the books! How'd he get a 7 pair? I gave him a 7 points. Hey. Let's play one more round. I'm done. This isn't over. One more round. You'll never beat me. You asshole! One Ear? I'm sorry I didn't recognize you. You changed the 7 points to a 7 pair. - You're good, too. - I know. It's lie. But how can you tell when someone's bluffing? At what point do you know? You need to read the opponent's mind. How do you do that? I don't know. Never look at the opponent's eyes when you're bluffing. What exactly happened between you and Agwee? I'm feeling drunk. He cut off my ear for cheating then cut off my hand for losing. It's not a big deal. This will happen to you, too. - Where can I take you? - Anywhere. What about Kyeonggi Province? Or maybe the pier by Yeonan? - I don't care. - Okay. The pier, it is. Wait! Stop the car! Hey! But... I'll do it. You look so pretty. Are you kidding me? Don't you like how you look? - I'll do it over. - No. - Forget it. Honey! - What is it? She can't do this right. I'm a mess! - What? Where's the manager? - I'm so sorry. - You don't like it? - We'll do it over for you. - Does she can do this? - Yes, but... Sorry. - Hello. - Hello. Where's your bride? - She's somewhere nearby. - I see. Get him some coffee. Okay. Part time job? For now. I'd like to open my own shop someday. I saw the bride yelling at you. Don't have enough skills? I have skills. The problem's with the bride. I bet you have skills. Did you spend all night gambling? I lost everything. Wait, the scissors... Remember how Goni promised to pay our debts for us? - Yeah. - But... He never gave a dime to his family. Do you believe that? I'm going to see them tomorrow. You can't let a woman tell you what to do. You're one to talk. You need to show them who's boss! Like I did with Se-ran. - Gwang? - Should I put eggs in your ramen? Honey, come on. Don't get your hands dirty! Your hands... Nice day. So I give this money to your sister or your mom? You sure you're not coming? Fine. My uncle's a prick. Try not to punch him. I can't promise you that. See you. Hello. I'm KO Gwang-ryul. Hello. Goni sent me here. What? You know my son? - Yes. - Goni? He's busy with work. He asked me to bring you this money. He had to stay behind because of work. - where is he? - Great. Is he doing well? Of course. He's doing too well, in fact. Goni's got a job? Hello. You must be his uncle. We work at an export company. Selling what? We make those... Uh... We make batteries. This is all money? Yes. Ouch... This kid's made huge bucks! I'll go count this. - Are you okay? - Not really. Got any extra pair of pants? - Bring him a pair. - Okay. Tell me the truth. Is Goni still into gambling? He's an honest man now. - Mr. KO? - Yes. - Please take care of my son. - Sure. Don't let him go back to gambling. Here. Take this. It's for the noodles. Please, keep it. Please. Goni's a good kid. He's very hardworking. He is so gentle man. He must take after you. And the boy's got balls. It's not a bad thing. That's a good thing. He's popular with women. Listen, please. What am I saying? One time, I was trying to ask this girl out, and Goni snatched her away from me! I could have killed him. I'm just joking. He's a good kid. He won't trouble you anymore. - Thank you. - No problem. Look what your uncle did! Goni won last time. Goni's going to play a game against KWAK. What's in that head of yours? I can't let him go to KWAK. Why didn't you tell me about this sooner? I didn't know about this either. I was looking for Mu-seok. How much did Goni win? About 400 million. He can't play against KWAK. I see you. Hello. I knew you'd find me. You've gained weight. Have a seat. The chairs look uncomfortable. I came to ask you a favor. You're starting to scare me. I've started a new job in Kunsan, but I have no players. Why don't you come with Gwang? Hello there. Oh! Hello! I'll pay you 10 times the amount from Busan. Who is she? I'm not strapped for cash. Goni? - Lunch is ready. - Okay. Hello. Hello. Who are you? I'm his girlfriend. I heard a lot about you. You did? What did he tell you? You're not as chubby as he said you are. How are you two getting along? It's hard to control a man like him. Love isn't about control. You make a nice couple. What's with this suit? So childish. Call me if you need anything. I'm staying at the Jeonju Hotel. See you. Goodbye. Who does she think she is? Bitch. - What is it? - Do one more thing. I need you to steal me a car. For 5 million won. Goni's car? You left the money in the car? This is awful! I can pay you more than that! Really? Of course! - I'll get the shirt. - Okay. - You take my pants - Okay. - What is it? - Go home. What? Go home! Now! Asshole. Turn on the lights. I was having fun. We need to talk. What's my share? Uh... Goni? What if KWAK finds out? That's your choice to make. Either he kills you, or I do. I've got no choice. Do I? How have you been? Did you have dinner yet? We don't always have the time to eat. - Have a seat. - Thank you. Let's run a check. They're going to use a camera on you. Can I turn this on? So no one is tempted to cheat. Don't turn it on! - No! It's just for precaution. You never know. - Just for precaution. - How do I turn this on? - And they'll drug you. - Give it. I apologize for Goni. He's way too suspicious. Want another cup? No. - We're so sorry. - Forget it. Let's begin. I start. You know the rules. No bluffing, no limits. Let's go. I have flowers. I'm sorry. - Seven. - Eight. One pair. Three pair. You might want to stop drinking. Ten million. I see you, and raise you 30. Let's go with 100. No limits. You can fold if you're pissed. I fold. I'm not pissed at you. Got a good hand? You bet. Then I'll see you. I fold. Seven pair. I'm sorry. It's a push. You want to take this back or double it? Double or nothing. Eight. I'm sorry. It's another push. Triple or nothing. Cut. I'll do it. I've got a lousy hand. I fold. - Twenty. - I have no money left. - All in. - Yes, sir. All in. - Check the money. - Yes, sir. - It's all clean, sir. - Hold on. Let's make this bigger. I'm throwing in 500 mil. We'll play again next time. What did you have? Nothing much. One point? You bet 500 million with that? Thank you for the money. Hey. You want to come work for me? I'm not interested. What's keeping Mu-seok? What if they found out? They won't. I have to pee. - Oh my goodness. - You can go first. Really? I'll meet you at the cafe. Should I start a business with this money? Yeah. I knew you'd laugh. I'll see you later. I can't endure anymore. I have to pee! They knew all our tricks. There's a traitor amongst us. Sir. It wasn't me. Where's my money? I knew you'd say that. - What are you doing? - Don't playing game! Get these bitches out! Get the money. You're still alive? I'm here to buy the women. With what? - Money? - Isn't that the rule? You and I... both play by no one's rules. But we need to respect them in some cases. Wasn't that my money to start with? That means we have no deal. In exchange, I'll work for you for the next 2 years. Sir, are you sure you can trust him? Let me ask you this, Yong-hae. Can you put your neck on the line, like he's done? Of course. What you laughing at? You should have stayed away when you had the chance. Give me the phone. - The money's all there? - Yes. - Get my car. - Yes, sir. Release the girls. Do as I say. Let's go. What are you going to do with Gwang? I started this life when I was 17. I'm the only man who's managed to come this far. Want to know how? By outsmarting the best ones and killing off the traitors. - Goni. - Yes? - Bum a smoke. - Yes, sir. Sir, the Olympic Highway is a disaster. Then take the Mapo Bridge. Yes, sir. Hey! - Ye-rim? - I'm so sorry. Why didn't you return my messages? I had things to take care of. - What kind of things? - I'm sorry. - You don't have to apologize. - I want to see you tomorrow. - Alright. I love you. - Love you, too. Kiss, kiss! Get this out of the way! And cover up the windows! Who'd want to lose money in a broad daylight? Are you mad? Trust! That's important to us. You are mad! Ye-rim! Ye-rim! Ye-rim! Hey! Don't fix that! Let insurance cover it! Are you breaking up with me? No. Why haven't you come to see me? - I can't tell you. - What is it? I played cards that night. You did? - Sotda? Gostop? - Sotda. Sotda? It's great. I didn't know you knew how to play that. I'm usually calm but... I get a rush when I'm holding those cards. - I was out of my mind. - Gambling is not a bad thing. Want me to get your money back? You can't get mixed up in this. Those people are smart and rich. Hwatu is about luck and balls. If you've got balls, you'll win the game. The hardest part is to draw him into the game. Once he sits down, it's easy to raise the stakes. Before you ran away, right? You seems strange. You in? - You? - Of course. The Bible says never miss out on a game like this. - Fifty. - Wow. Then I have to play by God's Word. Fifty. What do you have? I see your fifty. Two pair. KIM! Call Ye-rim. Sir. You can't do this. You're losing control. Just call Ye-rim. You lost all that money? First, get his money. He'll think he's losing because he's got no cash. That's why I'll lend him half of the money up front. - Sir. - Go wait in the car. Eight pair! Nine! He'll lose money. - That money will come to me. - Here we are. Then I'll lend him the money back. The cash goes round and round. Wait! I'm in. That way, no one wins. Soon, he'll rack up hundreds of millions in debt. That's when I end the game. I was on a winning streak, but Mrs. CHO got lucky. You lost 2 billion! And not just that! I know! I lost dollars, too. That's not worth much to you, - but that's all I've got! - Okay! Okay! I'll get it all back. I'll loan 3 billion more with my real estate as collateral. Would that be enough? Don't you need at least 5 billion? Isn't is enough? - You're right. What is gambling? - Riding the waves. Once I go down, I'll come back up. This time, I'm going to win! Take care of yourself. Good luck! Good luck to you. - Madam? - Huh? Do you have news on Goni? No one knows where he is. If you find him, will you tell him I'm here? Of course. He'll come running if he knows you're here. Thank you. - Bye. - Thank you. He will be dearly missed. The seed that planted can't alive unless it died. The dead people's revival is same as well. He's here. I hear you're looking for Goni. - I want revenge. - What for? KWAK wasn't your father or anything. You can't think of this as revenge. Revenge is much too kind. It's making a money. This is a quest for blood. I have to go home to my son. Don't let them go anywhere until Goni gets back. - Watch them! - Yes, sir. It's me. Meet me inside the cab that pulls up at 5 o'clock. I'm sorry about all this. You look prettier with your hair down. - Keys to Goni's car. - Thanks, Raccoon. All I need is my money. Give him 10 million in cash. I have news on Agwee. I'm tired of hearing about him. Mr. PYEONG fell off the train somewhere near Kangkyung. But Agwee got off before that. He got off near Nonsan. That means he wasn't the one who killed Mr. PYEONG. There was someone else in that train. Who? I'm not sure, but there was a witness. You miserable fuck! He told me the killer had a gold plated tooth... Why... Why? Mr. PYEONG... That asshole ruined my life. He turned me into this mess. I'll leave the money. The house is closed tonight? - It's been a long time. - Yeah. It's very simple. Bring Goni to me. No. Sweetheart. You gotta do this for me. There's no evidence to prove he killed KWAK. - What did you say? - Stay out of this. I hear you set up a game for some rich bastard. I could ruin that setup. Are you threatening me? - Do you know who I am? - Of course I do. But I also know you don't want your name in tomorrow's paper. What a... It must be unlucky day. I'll think about it. What more do you have to think about? What'll you do to him? Don't worry. I'll take him out of your hands. Can't you go easy on him? - What? I never figured you for the romantic type. When did you get so soft? I want 50% of the earnings. Watch it. You get 20%, I get 80%. Or else. Or else what? Tell the old man I'm a pro. I'll play for him. Deal? This man is here to help me. Can he join? Is that okay? Of course. As long as he got the cash. Let's play with chips. There's too much cash flying around. If I catch anyone cheating, I'm slicing off their wrists. That won't be necessary. Of course. Cut? I've put my life on the line. You think you'll scare me with that empty threat? Ten million. Let's go with 100. Scared? We're raising the stakes already? I see your 400. I raise you. - I fold. - Me, too. I'm starting to get scared. Here. You in? You bet. Eight pair! Oh no! I've lost! It's all in luck. Nine pair! - Gwang. - Do I know you? Think you can fool me? I'll bet my right hand and my money you have a card under your palm. - What will you bet? - Why are you doing this? - Uncle. - Yes? No wonder you lost. Oh. Where's my hammer? You can bet your ear instead. That's what One Ear did. You're Agwee! Grab him. I'm going after Goni next. No! Please! Hello? There's a cab standing out front. Come on out. Hello? Goni? - Se-ran? Gwang got hurt while playing hwatu. - I don't know what to do! - Who told you? These men here. - Se-ran! - How've you been? - What happened to Gwang? - Agwee took his right hand. He won't be able to come to the phone. Where's Agwee? He's with Madam JEONG. Your friend's dying, and your chick is here with us. Don't hurt her. She means nothing to me. Hello? Hello? You said I don't know how to love. You could be right. If I ever come back, I promise I'll never leave you again. One ticket to Kunsan. One-way or round trip, sir? Round trip. I'm going to kill Goni tonight. The problem is the money. Watch out for Madam JEONG. I'm going to make money tonight. That's all we're after. What about Goni? Over here! How've you been? - Where's Agwee? - He's waiting. Get in. We need to do a great job. I put all my money in this game. What are you going to do? I'll play the traditional way. There's nothing to be scared of. There are no friends for life, just as there are no enemies for life. Everyone I know has been hurt or killed. Did you have dinner yet? Could have been your last supper. Shut up. Don't fucking mess with me. I've seen enough shit in this world. We have a live one! - Where's Gwang? - Why are you in such a rush? You'll see him soon at the hospital. Why don't we say the loser has to give up his right hand? Sounds fun. Captain? Take him to the back. Ye-rim! They are so cruel. You have to get off the ship! Make sure your safe. It's no use acting nice here. We're in hell. You idiot. It's every man for himself. Now get out of my way. Fuck... - Gwang! - Goni? Are you okay? It'll take more than this to kill me. - Why did you come here? - To win money. What about you? To win money. Just walk away. I'll be back. Closes from Behind - 400. - I fold. - Uncle? - Yes. - What do you have? - Three pair. Four pair. I fold. I see your 300. I raise you 300. - You can fold if you're low. - I fold. Eight points. Nine points. We went through - 400. - I fold. - 300. - I fold. - 100. - I fold. - 20. - I fold. Is that all you're going to do tonight? What's it to you? I'm worried you'll lose your hand. That's so sweet. Uncle, why don't you go play some baduk? That's a good idea. Captain? Come play with me. - I don't know how. - Let me teach you. This game is for the pros. Okay. Show. - Seven points. - Ten points. I raise you. That's all you won? That's not enough. Abracadabra. - What are you saying? - Nothing. - Abracadabra - That's what Mr. PYEONG does. Finger! You're the guy from the train! How's Mr. PYEONG doing? - He's dead. - How'd he die? He fell off a train with his right hand cut off. What a fantastic way to die. - I fold. - I fold. That's still not enough. I should get my hammer ready. A dagger slices the air. It stabs at my heart. But my hands are faster than the eye. Agwee gets cards from below the stack. I get a card from the top. - Trying to cheat me, boy? - What? My cards came from below the stack! You trying to fool me? - Got proof? - Of course. You gave me a 9 pair. And you were about to give Madam JEONG this! See this? You wanted this to end as a tie. That's a nice little story. Ye-rim? Check the other card! Don't touch it! Bring me the hammer! - Do you have to do this? - Wait. You really want to see blood? This is how we roll. Fine. I bet you my right hand this is not a maple card. You scared? You messing with me, boy? No talk and no action? - You scared? - Scared? Fine, I bet my right hand, too. Tie us up. You ready? Let's check our card. - It's a sakura! - A sakura? I saw him take them out from the bottom! Never make a bet unless you're damn sure. - Well? Give me your hand! - Get him! Get him! What's going on? What is he doing? Now all I do is take my money. Captain. Untie Goni's hand. Okay. I'm fine. Get Gwang. What should we do? - Call the cops! - You think so? Do it! Wait. Mr. PYEONG lost his right hand? How did you know that? It was just a guess. - Wasn't it? - Why did you do it? Don't yell at me! Why are you doing this? Why are you doing this? - Do it! - I can't. Don't look at me like that. You saw how he treated me. He treated me like dirt! How is this a sakura? You have to understand. Let's get the money first. You want the money? I did this for you! You wouldn't have come this far if you had stayed with Mr. PYEONG! I only take half of my wins. What are you doing? Are you crazy? Stop it! No! Stop it! Where's the fire extinguisher? extinguisher... No, it can't be... He gave me a 9 pair. - Why did he give her a 3? - My money! My money! Why is it not working? For the last time, do it! Now! - Do it! - I'm sorry! No! No! Stop. You can't leave. Are you going to see her? I don't care where you go. Just hand me the money. Or I'll shoot. Leave the money! I'll shoot! I can shoot! We should go. - To the nearest hospital. - Hospital? - Is the money all gone? - We have to go. No. Hurry! You'll be fine. Goni? Why do you hang around a loser like me? Because we're both from Namwon. Actually, I'm from Busan. - Is your hand okay? - It's fine. I don't need your money. Still smoking those cigarettes? Let's see it. Name, KIM Gon, 28. Address unknown. - He fell off a train. - Will you confirm the body? It's him. - Cover him up. - It's OK. I wonder where Goni is now. I never got to say goodbye. Are you asking me if I knew Goni? He was the best I've ever seen.
