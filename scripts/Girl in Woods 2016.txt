Hey, hey, we're here. You okay? Yeah. All right. Hey. Well? Yeah? Yes! Yes? Yes. Gracie. Daddy? Hey, hey, it's okay. Hey, it was just a dream. It was just a dream. Hey, hey, slow breath. Breathe. Slow down. So you're good now. I'm right here. I'm sorry. -It's okay. -Breathe. It was just a bad dream. I just feel like such a freak sometimes. Stop it. Don't. Look, everybody has bad dreams. Was it your dad? It's okay. I'm right here. I just... I don't think anyone could get over seeing something like that. How could you? Kids aren't built to see their parents kill themselves. It's just I don't think about it for months, and then it just creeps up on me. I'm sorry. I feel really stupid right now. Stop. Don't. You just need to relax, okay? Okay. Are you sure you want to marry me, still? I'm very sure. Hey, don't forget a light jacket or something, okay? -Why? -Bugs. I wouldn't want you gettin' eaten alive. Bugs. Great. Gotcha. Hey, honey? Think we'll be back by dinner? Yeah. Why? No reason. Just checking. You ready? It's gonna be great. Right. When are you gonna tell me what it is? It's gonna be a day you'll never forget. So, you found a spa with a full body massage and a hot tub? Thank you. Better! What could be better than that? Come on. That's for the honeymoon. You can Facebook your friends when you get back. You're mine right now, all right? I think that's fair. Okay, but I should at least be able to call my friends. Does the cabin have a phone? We're gonna be back in two days. You can tell them then. Okay. -Okay? -Okay. Where are we going? There should be a waterfall up here, I think. Really? Yeah, if I read the map right... Jim, if we're gonna go look at a waterfall, then why do you need a gun? -To be safe. -Safe from what? -Bears. -Bears? Jim, you're not serious. Don't worry. Don't worry about the bears. That sounds easy. What about snakes. Are there snakes, too? Don't worry! I hate snakes. See? Just like the brochure. Hey, you remember when we first met? Yeah, why? I was just thinking that we were a mess? Now look at us. I guess this must mean we... We must be pretty good for each other? You know, you've changed my life in a lot of ways. Hey, are you okay? Yeah. You want to get back to the cabin? I'm... I'm fine. Look, you don't have to pretend with me, okay? I love you. Thank you. You know what? I'm... I'm gonna actually... I'm gonna go back and find an easier way for us to get back, all right? Okay. Just sit right there. I'll come back and get you whenever I find it, all right? Okay. You know, I... I used to think I'd have a bunch of land like this someday. A little house with a bunch of land. Horses? Horses? What would I want with horses? 'Cause I love horses. Well, then, the lady shall have horses! -She wants horses? -We'll get her horses! I'm gonna have to get a better Jim! Jim. Jim. My god. Jim? I'm gonna get help. Okay? I'm gonna get help. Somebody help me! Something's gotta look familiar. Some... Hello! My god. My god. My god. Please work. Hey, you're gonna have to wait. I doubt you're gonna get a signal out here. I told ya: Out here, it's just you, me, and the woods! My god. You gotta be fucking kidding me. Shit. Daddy? Daddy? I'm comin'. I'm comin'. Daddy? It's all right. Daddy's here. Daddy? Momma? Sorry, honey. Daddy was a weak man. It's okay, honey. Momma's here. It's just the heat. It's just the heat. That's all. That's all. What the...? You've changed my life in a lot of ways. Daddy? No, daddy. Momma? Hi! I was just rocking you to sleep. I've missed you. Momma, Jim killed himself. I know. But he wasn't very good for us. I love him. Well, we know what that does to people, don't we? Look at daddy. -Daddy didn't... -no, baby. He loved us. Baby, daddy tried. Tried, tried. Sorry I couldn't do any better. Bye. Hello! Who's there?! Who's there?! Daddy? Daddy. Daddy! What is it, baby? There's something in the closet. I saw it. In the closet. -Gracie. -No! There's nothing in the closet, baby. There's... look, look, baby. There's nothing there. There was something in there! Baby, I-i know that you think there's something... no, there was something in the closet. I saw it! I know, baby. -No! -No, I know. I-it's in your imagination. No, there was something in the closet! There's nothing there. Look! There's nothing there, baby. I saw it. -It's not there. -I want mommy. No, baby, I don't want to talk about mo... -I want mommy! -I don't want to talk abou... she believes me! You never believe me! -Give me a hug, baby. -No. I want mommy. Okay. You want mommy? What is it, honey? What happened? There was something in the closet and daddy didn't believe me. He never believes me. Well, sometimes daddies don't always understand. Do you believe me? Well, of course I do. That's what mommies are for, to believe little girls, right? Does daddy love you? He did. A long time ago. What happened? Honey, that's not for little girls to worry about. You need to get some rest. C'mere. Let me hold you. Good girl. Will you sing to me, momma? Sure, baby. Damn it, Jim. You remember to pack water, but no protein bars? Shit! Guess I missed lunch today, didn't I? It's too bad, because I was gonna have a big, fat burger. I know. Fuck my figure, right? Why couldn't you be like a normal guy and just propose to me at like a football game or a restaurant? I mean, the woods, Jim? Really? I saw you. I saw you! I saw you! I saw you! Come back! Granddaddy? Where have you been? I thought you died. I know. What are you doing here? Came to get you. Get me? Take me where? I want to take you back with me. It's okay. You can come. I don't think I should. Granddaddy. I know what you're thinking. It's a good plan. It'll work. We made it here from the cabin in one morning. That means I'm one morning away. All I have to do is mark where I go. Just leave markers, you know? And if I haven't reached the cabin by afternoon, I'll follow my trail back. And if I keep doing that, I'll find it. Damn it! Hungry? I don't fucking need you! I'll find something to eat! Sure, baby. Just keep lookin'. I have full confidence in you. I mean, after all, you've done so well, so far. Go away! I'll find something! Get it off! Get it off! You don't have to eat that. You have the gun. What is it, baby? I heard something. I'm sure it's just the house. Come on. Let's get some dinner, okay? Okay. Hey, hey, baby, what... What are you listening to? Just a tape mommy made for me. Mommy? Gracie. Look at me, Gracie. It's... it's okay, baby. You made her mad. What's wrong, momma? Nothing's wrong, honey. Mommy's okay. Why'd you walk away? Is it because of daddy? Well... daddy, he's kind of trying to take you away from me. -What? -We... we don't need to talk about that right now, though. I just want you to know, no matter what, mommy loves you so much. I love you, too, momma. Okay. Gracie, come help me, will you? My god. No, come on. No, no, no. Just 10 more minutes. Come on! Fuck! Son of a bitch! Just die, like everyone else! Fine! I don't need you! I saw the map, and it said straight that way! -Think about this. -What do you want?! If you go tramping through the woods, you're gonna mess up. You have to start thinking. I am thinking! I saw the fucking map, and it said straight that way! Straight that way, if you go a little to the left, is gonna turn into way the hell over there. Then what? You're running out of chances. What do you mean? Where's the water bottles and the rifle? Right. You got so excited about that little dot on the map, you didn't even think about them. Luckily, you still have the lighter. I couldn't shoot shit with that rifle, anyway, and I'll find water. I will! Really? I don't fucking need this! Stupid cunt. Let me see. Leave me alone. Let me see. That's bad. God! You need to set that finger. Fuck off! What are you doing? I'm wrapping my fucking hand! What does it look like I'm doing?! No, you need to clean it, first. If you don't, it's gonna get infected. Shut. Up. Would you please just listen to me? What's the point? We're all gonna die out here, anyway. We're not gonna die. If she would just listen to me. My god. Do you ever shut up?! You really should set that, though, because, if you don't, it's gonna hurt like a bitch. I don't know how. Don't be such a fucking baby. If I know, then you know. Just like in the movies, hon. Just do it. I can't. Just do it, hon. It's gonna hurt, but it has to be done, okay? Hey, baby. Hey, granddad. What are you doing here? I wanted to see you. How's your hand? It hurts. Come here, baby. You remember when you were little, and we'd dance in my living room? It was my favorite thing to do. Grandma used to watch from the couch and you would just laugh. You would smile so much. God, I missed those days. Why do people have to die? 'Cause that's the way we have to live. I don't understand. It's all part of the same game. Remember when dad died? Yeah. Why did he do it? I don't know, hon. I don't know. But enough of that now. I want my dance. You know, you're gonna have to talk to someone about it someday. If she ever gets out of these woods. You can't keep pretending it didn't happen. Why not? I think you know. Pretending it didn't happen is not gonna make it go away. It's not that easy. No one said it's supposed to be easy. It's infected. I can see that! Just cut the fucker off and forget about it. Jesus. I need to build a fire. You do that and, while you're at it, can we order a pizza? 'Cause this starving shit's for the birds. If you weren't such a dumb cunt, you wouldn't have thrown the gun away and maybe we could kill that thing that's after us and have a good, old-fashioned barbecue. I got it wet. Save it. You don't need the fire. It might have one more light. Save it. Gracie... Gracie... Gracie. Grace. Momma. Come see momma. No, I don't want to. I don't want to see this again. But, Gracie, we always had so much fun. Momma, why?! Why? Why? He made me do it. He made me do it! No, that's not true! Yes! Yes, grace! Yes! -No. -It's all his fault. He made me do it, grace. He made made me do it! There's daddy's little girl. -Daddy, pl... -maybe your granddaddy's right. You need help, honey. Please, help. Mommy's hurt really bad. And Gracie, you know I don't like you to talk about mommy. I don't want to talk about mommy! Please, help me. This is your fault. Your fault. You did this, baby. He doesn't believe us. He never believes us. Whiny bitch. Shut him up. Daddy, please. It's really bad. I need your help, please. I tried to help you. I tried. Look what you did, baby. Did he really think that he could separate us? Momma? Yeah. He did. Well, he got what he deserved. He should have just let us be. Yeah. That's momma's girl. Do it. Do it! Well? Is that the one you wanted? Yeah. Dad said that money was tight this year. I know. I don't understand. Well, I got it for you. You deserve it. Are you sure it's the one you wanted? Thank you! This is the best Christmas ever. Good. I tell you what, come, go with me. No. You can't. But I want to go. I want to be done with this. You can't. We need you. It's up to you. It's your choice. Just cut it off. To hell with it. No, I can't. Hey! Down here! Hey! Hey! Down here! Hey! Hello! Down here! Hey! We should have followed it. I think it's afraid of us. -I don't think so. -Me, either, but we need to find out what it is. Why? -Because what if it's... -are you crazy? We need to kill it. Kill it? We can't kill it. We have to fucking kill it. Shut up! I told you to cut it off. I can't. "I can't." Just look at it. If you don't cut it off, it's gonna fall off. I need it. Yeah? Okay. Cut me off! You need to get up. We've been here for almost three days. Seriously, get up! Do you want to die out here? Give it up. She's gone. You need to go away. I'll leave when she tells me to. Both of you, just leave. But... You need me. Go. You heard the girl. Come on. Let's go. Go. Your grandpa's right. We have to get you help, baby. No. Your momma is dead. She's been dead a long time, baby. She's not dead. You just don't like her. She is dead. You... You haven't seen her. That's your imagination. He made me do it! No! No! No! No! No! I know who did it. It was that thing. It dug up his body so it could eat it. We need to do something about it. But what? We need to kill it. How? We'll think of something. The two of us. Together. That's just what we'll do. We'll follow the creek downstream. I bet they've been using it as a water hole. Die! That's where they live. Who? Those things. Those demons. How do you know? Sniff. You can smell them in the air. Be careful. There might be a lot of them. Is that them? Yeah, I'm up here at granddad's shack. That deer stand's still up here. Is, Presley still up? Yeah, let me talk to him real quick. Hey, son, how are you doing? Well, I got some good news. Granddad's deer stand's still up here, so, probably about time for somebody's first hunting trip. I'm looking forward to it, too, son. You're sure you're ready now? All right. Yeah, I love you, too, son. All right, say your prayers. Let me talk to your mom real quick. Yeah, he sounds pretty excited, doesn't he? I'll give you a call tomorrow, babe. All right. Yeah, I love you, too. Bye-bye. Ma'am? Ma'am, are... Are you okay? You're that... that girl that's been missing. Are you grace Walker? Your grandfather's right. We have to get you help. Hey, are you okay? We need to get back to the cabin? She's dead, baby! She's been dead... -she's not dead! -She's dead. You... You haven't seen her. That's your imagination. He's gonna try and take you away from me. You're gonna have to talk to someone about it someday. You can't keep pretending it didn't happen. We need to kill it. He's gonna kill us... Unless we kill him first. Do it! Come see. Go see daddy. Go see daddy, grace. Go see daddy. He's gonna kill us unless we kill him first. Do it. Do it, grace. Sweetie. What are you doing? I love you, daddy. Did we do it, momma? Yes, baby. And now we can be together forever.
