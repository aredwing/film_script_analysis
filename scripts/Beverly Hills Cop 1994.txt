Giolito and Pederson, block this door. OK? Rondell and Leppert, hit the back door. No problem. It's a piece of cake. McKee and Cline, you're outside in case we get some jump-outs... - Foley. - Excuse me a sec. Where in the hell is SWAT? - Boss, I cancelled the SWAT team. - You what? I wouldn't raid a church bingo game without SWAT. These guys are carjackers. They're mechanics. We don't need SWA blowing holes in my evidence. Besides, they might shoot somebody. Let's do this. This is your operation. I'm just an observer, but I'll be watching. Just observe how I don't have to use SWAT, and trust me. Everybody's ready? Nobody need to take a nervous piss? Let's mount up. This is Dick Burton. We've got 55 degrees this morning. Here's Diana Ross and the Supremes, Come See About Me. What are you doing? Bobby, they're here. Any trouble with the hijack? - Right where you said. - Piece of cake. - Anybody hurt? - No. Good. I don't like to see people unnecessarily injured. Nobody got hurt, boss. - Keys? - Ain't yours till we see money. I just want to look in the back. - Where's our money? - Pay him. You think we should have used SWAT? - Fuck SWAT. - That's what I say. Fuck SWAT. - Some guy. What should I do? - Kill him. How you doing? Is this the illegal chop shop where they chop up cars? I got my wife's Buick. I want it chopped, the bitch ain't been right. Go, go, go! Go! They got fucking machineguns. - You said they had no guns! - They must have changed their view. Get the 12-gauge. We should've called SWAT. Police! Hands in the air! Move it! Go! Go! What the...? Daniel, come on! Cover me. I'm going in with Todd. Axel, you on a coffee break? Go get that son of a bitch. Boss. Hey, man! Shit! We got a tail. Wax that clown. God damn it! Help me, man. Police officer! Trying to catch a killer. Move it! - Get out of my way! I'm a cop! - Take it easy. Get the fuck out of here, all right? Thank you. My name's Steve Fulbright. Could I see some ID, please? I am a Detroit police officer. My name is Axel... Where's my shit? I'm a police officer chasing a killer who's getting away now. - We know. - You know what? We know. What's happened is you're in the middle of a federal investigation. What, income tax? The fucking guy just shot a police officer! It's very important he not be apprehended at this time. We want to know where he's going and who he's selling it to. - It's drugs? - We're not DEA. We appreciate your co-operation on this. I checked with Washington, Fulbright's kosher. He's working on something classified. If they want these guys loose we should close the investigation. Fuck them. I want the man that killed Todd. What you got? Not a hell of a lot. The dead mechanics were executed. Only one was strapped, he was still holstered. The bodies of the shooters had 30,000 cash. - High-price heat. - San Diego drivers' licenses. San Diego PD's sheet says enforcers for hire for Tijuana drug dealers. It's about drugs? An attach case had a towel from the Wonder World Hotel, California. Wonder World? Did you check out that car they shot Todd from? Rental from the airport. The renter's a Dr Oliver Hirsch. - A stolen ID? - Yeah. Doctor said it was lifted while in an amusement park. - I hope the park was Wonder World. - Yeah. - Excuse me. - Wonder World. I understand that you were with him at the end. Yeah. His last words were about you. That does not sound like my Douglas, Axel. Try again. Actually, his last words were, "Axel, are you on a coffee break? Go and get that son of a bitch." Those were his last words. - That sounds like my Douglas. - It sounds like a good idea, too. Hello, I'm looking for Billy Rosewood. Welcome to Beverly Hills Police. To continue this message in English, press one. For Spanish, press two. For Farsi, press three. If you have homeless people on your lawn, press 15. If you need the riot rumour hotline, press 17. Which button for Billy Rosewood? Monsieur Rosewood? In the house? Le Rosewood. Moi le Rosewood. "Monsieur tait beau. Le crayon. La table." Come in. It's open. - Axel Foley! - Billy, how you doing? - I don't believe it. - Look at your office! Look at this! You got three windows, venetian blinds, and a ficus. One of them big, healthy ficus in your office. Not just the ficus. Look. You got a refrigerator in your office? J Edgar Hoover didn't have a refrigerator. Just some hair curlers or something. - Did they promote you to captain? - I'm DDO-JSIOC. The JG-Joe-Joe-C? What is that? Deputy Director of Operations for Joint Systems Interdepartmental Operational Command. Here we are. Los Angeles. one of the greatest cities in the world, Axel, divided by its unique geography. - Geography? - LA is a vast metropolis with social and economic imbalances spread over an enormous distance. A criminal hits Beverly Hills, then West Hollywood, then downtown. Whose responsibility is it? Everybody's? Impossible. So it comes here. Every crime that crosses the green line. - The green line? - Green lines of jurisdiction. Beverly Hills, West Hollywood, Santa Monica. Officers respect these green lines, but the criminal doesn't. Whenever a criminal crosses green lines, the DDO-JSIOC goes to work. Very impressive, Billy. I control the green lines, and Axel... whoever controls the green lines controls Southern California. You wanted to see me, Billy? The sheriff's department nabbed two guys pulling a stall-and-hook. It's the same MO as those jobs on Melrose. I'll run out there and talk to them. They're in Van Nuys. I'll tell them you're coming. Jon, I want you to meet a friend of mine. Axel Foley. Axel, Jon Flint. How are you? I've heard about you. You're from Detroit, right? - Taggart talked about you. - Taggart! Where is he? Taggart's retired to Phoenix. Spends his days lost in the woods looking for his golf balls. That's a dream I'm not too far from myself. What brings you to California? Vacation? - I'm looking for a killer. - In Beverly Hills? - No. Wonder World. - Wonder World? You mean Rufus Rabbit has gone berserko? No. My boss got gunned down. The killer escaped in a cream-coloured Ford truck. - I think it's here. - Plates? Plates were phoney. Some evidence points to Wonder World. I want to go to Wonder World and ask some questions. - Would y'all know somebody there? - Ellis DeWald, head of security. Biggest private security force in America. - Can you introduce me to him? - Soon as I get back from Van Nuys. You go on out. I'll call DeWald, tell him you're coming. - He's a pal of mine. I'll meet you. - Great. Thanks. You'll love Wonder World, it's a great place. Axel, don't forget, we play by the rules around here. I've heard Taggart's stories. Which one of those green lines is Wonder World behind? Welcome to Wonder World. Can I help? Yes, I'd like to talk to a park executive, a Mr. Ellis DeWald. - Do you have an appointment? - I'm supposed to. Axel Foley. I'm sorry, sir. I don't have you on the list. Maybe they haven't called yet. A Detective Flint was supposed to call and get me squared away. If you don't have an appointment you'll need a ticket. - How much is a ticket? - $35. That allows you access to all rides and attractions. Wait a minute. I don't want to go on any rides. All I wanna do is talk to the director of security. Excuse me, sir, would you step out of line? - What line? - Just step over here, please, sir. Thank you. - Is there a problem, sir? - $35, that's the problem. If the admission seems high, try Fantasy Park. You might find their ticket price to your liking. I'm here to see Ellis DeWald. Is he your boss? Yes. Mr. DeWald is head of guest relations. - Do you have an appointment? - I'm supposed to. Supposed to is not having, is it, sir? Excuse me. - One, please. - There you go. Thank you. Thank you. You should have your tailor cut the jacket a little wider. That way your gun won't bulge in the back. Thank you. Uncle Dave. What's going on? "Alien Attack"? Can I help you? I was just curious what Alien Attack is. Watch. Attention! This is a red alert. Aliens are invading the city. Board the subway trains for immediate evacuation. This is wild. Yes. It's one of our more popular attractions. Excuse me, but what are you doing in here? You're right. I gotta go. I have a meeting, but thanks for the show. Tunnel nine. Take a look. - What should we do? - I'll send Cooper. Get him. Excuse me. - That's not fair. - Maintenance. Gotta grease a chain. - Hear how dry it sounds? - Sorry. Come on. Let's go. - Hi, Mom! - Up here! - Hi, Mommy! Up here! - We're here! - Bring that man down. - I can't until it goes all... - Bring it down, damn it. - Don't... Don't. Don't! Jesus! - What the hell? - Oh, my God! Code red on The Spider. Wonder World? Axel! Help! Help! Please! Shit! My God. Look! - Are you all right? - I'm OK, just don't let go. All units near Wonder World, proceed to assist in emergency rescue. You see this rope? We're gonna slide down it to the ground. - We are? - We're gonna try. Come up and hold on to my neck. Come on. It's OK. You gonna grab onto my neck really tight. Come on. Hold on really tight. Not too tight! Give me your hand. Come on. None of that. Give me your hand. Come on. It's OK. Come on. Hang on tight! Come on. Come on up. Our head of security confirmed your identity with the Detroit police. But neither they nor l... ..understand what you're doing at Wonder World. I'm investigating a crime. I've been here 10 minutes and I've already been shot at. Yes. Some of our guest relations people, you said. Miss Perkins is here with the surveillance tapes. Send her right in. This starts in The Spider maintenance tunnel. There I am, coming down the tunnel. - What is that? - Tracking. The monitors are looped. - I don't see any gunmen, Mr. Foley. - So who was I shooting at? You better think about a lawyer. The tapes don't show your gunman. They don't show something else, Mr. Foley's courage when the ride malfunctioned. He risked his life. They don't show that. That would be very impressive, if you didn't cause the malfunction. - Mr. DeWald. - Send him in. Mr. Foley, Mr. DeWald. You fuck! Motherfucker... That's him! That's the fucking guy I'm looking for! What's going on here? He shot a Detroit police officer last weekend! Last weekend? I was at my beach house in Laguna last weekend. Your beach home in Laguna? Wait. I think I got the wrong guy. I'm sorry. This is a big misunderstanding. You were at your beach... Fuck! Beach house in Laguna! You motherfucker! - Miss Bruce, call the police. - They just walked in. - That guy! That's the killer! - Ellis DeWald? We really appreciate this, Ellis. Your friend is lucky Mr. Sanderson doesn't want any publicity. You just keep him and his delusions out of my face and out of my park. No problem. You got it. By the way, are we still on for Sunday? Bring your money, sucker. All right. When you have some time, I'd like to... Not right now. Later, perhaps. Thanks. Here we go. Thank you. And the usual for you, Billy. - Thanks a lot. - Isn't it possible you're mistaken? That Ellis DeWald just resembles Todd's killer? I made the guy in Detroit. It was DeWald. He's the head of the largest private police department in California. He works with us, with the governor's office. Everybody loves him. He's getting an award from the Association of Security Agencies. It's understandable that you're distraught and looking for justice, not to mention revenge. But isn't it just possible that you want it so much that you saw your killer in a man who bore a slight resemblance? We run into this all the time in police work. - Where's he getting that award? - Don't! Flint, your friend DeWald is foul. I know he's foul, and I'm going to this awards show to put some pressure on him. Maybe panic him into doing something stupid. Axel, if you go to that dinner tonight... - I'm going with you. - Pick me up at the Sunset Motel. Freeze, motherfucker! - Detective Foley? - You're Uncle Dave! Oh, my God. I almost shot Uncle Dave! I'm so embarrassed. I'm sorry. Nice to meet you! Uncle Dave! The front desk let us in. I hope that's OK. No, it's fine. It's Uncle Dave! Uncle Dave! Have a seat. - Thank you. - I was such a fan of yours. - Thank you, son. - Uncle Dave... You're very kind. Detective Foley, what's going on at my park? - There's something going on? - I have no doubts. - What? - I have no doubts, nor do I have any ideas. Exactly two weeks ago, Detective Foley, Roger Fry, the park's chief operating officer... and my friend, disappeared. Roger Fry designed the park, from the landscaping to the concession stands. - What do you mean, disappeared? - Show him the note. I received this interoffice the day Roger disappeared. "This is important, life and death. Roger" - What was so important? - I don't know. What was he doing the day he disappeared? He was probably doing one of his usual inspections. - This guy designed the whole park? - Yes. - And he knew the place cold? - Of course. So what are you thinking? He must've found something someone didn't want him to find. At Wonder World? What on earth could that be? It's a place of childhood innocence and fun. And life and death. You met Uncle Dave? Uncle Dave. I don't believe it. I'd give anything to have been with you. - Did he do the Oki-Doki Shuffle? - No. Outstanding. - William Rosewood, DDO-JSIOC. - I beg your pardon? This is me. Thank you. What you gonna do with this shit? No way. I don't believe this! Ackwell! Ackwell Folee! Ackwell Folee, you crazy thing. What you doing here? - "Surge." - Serge. Look at your head! I love it short! - Yeah, Serge. - Turn around. Turn around. You look perfect! And finally you have black "Hush Poopies", which are totally retro. You put a good package together. - You remember Billy Rosewood. - Billy, I remember you. - Do you remember? - Of course. I made you an espresso at the art gallery with a lemon twist? It was the last one I ever made. It's terrible, espresso. You know why? It stain your teeth. I won't show you mine. Show me your teeth. They're so pretty. Can I see your teeth? And you got healthy gums. - Do you do colonics? - Excuse me? - Do you do colonics? - No. Never... - It's my new favourite! - You dig colonics? - They stick a hose up inside you... - I know... No, you've got to understand. Out comes a candy bar from when you were five! - What happened to your art gallery? - It is completely bankrupt, in the toilet. Why? Because we had an owner who was obstinate and stupid and ignorant. - You shot him, remember? - Yes. I shot him. - What are you doing now? - I'm doing guns. Come! This is my booth. The Survival Boutique. We are doing weapons and protective devices and products for survival in the helter-skelter world of today. One thing's very important. At the Survival Boutique, it's my philosophy that everything must conform to the three P's. Which is protection, prestige and pretty. Why should you look ugly if you're just trying to survive? You should maintain your style and be safe. Guess what this is. Is look like a key chain, but it's so much more. It's called a stunner. It is designed by an ex-Navy SEAL. Very serious individual, I never see him smile. Also I never see him in pants that fit. Someone comes up to you who is a carjacker. Do you want to die for your Camry? I don't think so. So you say - a little bit of deception - "l want to separate my house and car keys. "I'll just push this button, OK?" And he says, "OK." And then you push this button, and out it comes from the mechanism, the brightest, blinding light ever that you seeing. He cannot see. He's like this. Everyone is come running to help you. And once again, you have survived with style. That's cool. Billy, I want to give you one for a present. Thank you. And, Ackwell, I want to give you one because I worry about you. - I want you to be safe. - Thanks. Now I'll show you something that is going to blow your rocks off. It's absolutely orgasmic and my most thing that I'm proud of. It's the most up-to-date, the ultimate survival tool for today. A new generation of luxury personal weaponry, the Annihilator 2000 is America's premier survival, home and travel security unit. The Annihilator 2000 is a high-performance weapon that meets the demands of upper income urban survivalists. The Annihilator 2000 has the conveniences of a cellphone, fax and microwave oven. Night-vision goggles, microprocessor, verbal alarm systems, compact disc player, digital radio, video camera and playback functions are just a few features of the extraordinary Annihilator 2000. You think those are real? Stopping power is a matter of convenience. That's Dodi, my personal trainer. She can bench-press 200lbs. She's working on reducing my body fat, but it's difficult because I keep sneaking goat cheese. I don't care. I wear suits. The Annihilator 2000 is constructed of aluminium alloy combined with polymer technology, totally resistant to corrosion. A new generation in luxury personal weaponry, the Annihilator 2000 is America's premier survival, home and travel security unit. Who's gonna buy that shit? Are you joking? This is LA. I'm selling hundreds of these. - Get the fuck outta here! - No, because I am telling you, I sell 10 of these to Jackie Stallone. - Get the fuck outta here. - Sly bought 14. Zsa Zsa Gabor has one... - We gotta go, Surge. - Thanks. Ackwell, try to say Serge. It's not so difficult. "Surge" sounds like a detergent. What are you gonna do? Nothing. I just wanna hear the man speak. To keep a park like Wonder World a safe, wholesome, family environment in difficult times like these is an enormous challenge. But my friend Ellis DeWald has done just that. Couple that with Ellis' work with underprivileged kids, some of whom are seated at the head table right now with Ellis... ..and you can understand why he's our award winner. So let's bring him up here. Head of security at Wonder World and private law enforcement's Man of the Year award winner, my dear friend, Ellis DeWald. - Congratulations. You deserve it. - Thank you, Orrin. - Congratulations. - Thanks, Mike. You're not gonna do nothing. You never do nothing. Thank you very much. You know, a lot of nice things happen when you work at a nice place like Wonder World, especially when your bosses are people like Orrin Sanderson and Uncle Dave Thornton. I don't think that Uncle Dave would mind if I said that this is the nicest thing yet. Thank you very much. Please don't do this, Axel. Please don't do it. Don't do it. - Bravo! Bravo! - Don't do it. Bravo, Ellis DeWald! Ellis DeWald! Ellis DeWald, ladies and gentlemen! Ellis DeWald! Y'all keep it going! Keep it going for Ellis DeWald! Come on, it's Ellis! You're not clapping loud enough! This is Ellis DeWald! Ladies and gentlemen, I've travelled from Detroit to be with this man tonight, to honour this man tonight. My name is Axel Foley. I'm a Detroit police officer. It is a tremendous surprise for Mr. DeWald to have me next to him. I can feel his body tingling! But, ladies and gentlemen, there's not a night that goes by that I don't think about what I owe Ellis DeWald. And there's not a night that passes that I don't think about what the people of Detroit owe Ellis DeWald. And I'd like to say, when I see y'all give him this... What's this? That's beautiful... "With gratitude for community service." And I'm going to do the community a service because I'm going to pay back Ellis DeWald everything we owe him with interest! Go on, smile. Get them last few smiles in. What's the matter? You mad at me for shooting your boyfriend? I got him! I got him! I got him! You and Billy disturbing the peace? No! Just make your phone call and get us out of here. Sure. Who do I know down there? Let's see. Don't fuck with me right now. Keep your shirt on. I'll get you out. Incidentally, we found that truck you wanted. - Where? - By the Santa Monica pier. I'm headed there now. I'll pick you up on the way. In the meantime, don't take any showers. I'm all washed-up. Dead in the water. Stop worrying. Flint's going to get us out. I really liked that office. - Foley! You're out of here. - That was quick. Not him, just you. Come in. Thank you, officer. I ran a check on you, Foley. You're a hell of a detective, but something of a maverick. I know what you're doing. I know the drill. You hassle DeWald, you get him to panic, make a rash move... But God damn it, Foley, we do not want to panic this man. We want him doing business as fucking usual. Do you copy me, Foley? Ticket to Detroit, first class, courtesy of the Federal Government. Also, my card. Should you have any more thoughts about DeWald, let us handle it. I give you my word as a gentleman I'll be on that plane. Truck was spotted by an LAPD traffic officer. It's a different colour but the same make and model. Read you. Out. Beach leader, over? Negatory, SWAT, hold for our arrival. ETA...11 minutes. Out. Billy, who were you talking to? Truck was inside the county green line, so I co-ordinated with the SMPD, BHPD, LAPD, sheriff of Los Angeles County, Parks and Recreation, Highway Patrol, district attorney's office and US Naval Shore Patrol. Beach leader to team one. Proceed. All teams standing ready... Go! Go! Go! Area secured. Lab says these are the same fibres as the truck upholstery. No help there. Some sand, probably blew in after it was abandoned. I just had a very unpleasant conversation with my superiors. - About being busted? - No. There was some objection to my use of manpower on Operation Truck Siege. - What is it? - You got a $50 bill? I'm married with kids. I haven't seen a 50 in 12 years. - You got a $50 bill? - When do I get it back? Man, give me $50! It's all I got. This is part of a $50 bill like Billy's with the hidden barcode. The corner tore. Happens all the time. No, the barcode's going up, so it comes off this corner. If it comes off this corner it should have ink on it. It's too big to be blank. Look! It's Oki-Doki! Don't let your brother get away. I got to load my camera. Oki-Doki! Nice little kid. How you doing? Good to see you. - I love you, Oki-Doki! - Oki, do the Oki Shuffle. That's not right! It's like this. Listen, I changed the steps. You got a problem with that? You're supposed to be nice, no matter what! You little motherfucker... Grandma! Grandma! Oki-Doki pushed me! You take it already. Come on, Sheldon. You playing or what? Who ate garlic? When's lunch? I want a pastrami on rye. See that move, Rufus Rabbit? - Axel? - What? Coffee. Would you like some coffee? Louis, how's it going? - Fine, fine. - Say hi to Irene. - Will do. - Louis? Follow me. I wouldn't mind giving her a massage. When DeWald took over he stuck me down here on what he calls park safety watch. He thinks he took me out of the loop, but as long as I have a computer I can still access most of what's in the mainframe. - Is this the tunnel system? - Yes. Do any of these tunnels lead to somewhere only DeWald's boys can go? No. All park accesses are unrestricted to park personnel. Except for the Happy Forest. That's being redone. Show me the Happy Forest. That would be right here at the end of corridor B. It's right after... It's right after... - How long's it been closed? - Too long. I'm talking about the Happy Forest ride? The Forest. Yes, about a couple of weeks. It wasn't very popular so they're trying some new ideas. I think they found one. Can I have this? - Sure. - Thanks. There you go. You know... when this thing is over... Would you like to get together and have some dinner or something? - That would be nice. - Can you put that in here? Sure. There you go. - We have a date. - A date. All right. Can you help me with this? There you go. Remember, an elephant never forgets. All right. - Louis, how goes it? - Fine. Nice to see you. - Say hello to Irene. - You bet. See you. Everything on schedule? I had to tweak the image a little bit, but it's under control now. Foley's up there. Get him! Will the DeWald family please come to Tiny Town? The DeWald family to Tiny Town. But, honey, the Happy Forest is closed. OK, I'll meet you at the main gate at 5:00. - I'm sorry. - You're sorry? This is Detective Axel Foley. I'd like to speak with Agent Fulbright. Could you patch me into his radio? It's an emergency. Fulbright, Foley. I found what you're looking for. I'm at Wonder World. Fuck! Get out here now! Get me 911. All cars in the vicinity of Wonder World. Proceed there immediately. Why am I not surprised? All right, don't shoot! I'll put my gun down. I put my gun on the ground, and I'm unarmed. Don't shoot. This is great. You caught him. Good. He broke into a security area. Relax. Save that shit for new talent night at San Quentin. - I'm on to your operation. - My operation? God damn it, Axel, what have you done now? He went berserk. He was firing a weapon in the park. There are hundreds of children around. - They don't give Oscars in prison. - Fuck you! There's someone here from... Fulbright, Secret Service. - I put you on a plane to Detroit. - You're gonna be glad I stayed. I know what you're investigating. It's right here. Yeah? And what am I investigating? Paper, US Mint quality. That's what was in that truck. You wanted to follow the truck back to LA to find his print shop. - It's right here in Wonder World. - What is he raving on about? - He's insane! He's proved that. - In Wonder World? This place is as high-tech as NASA and Nintendo combined. They got a hidden room under this closed ride. I was in there. That's why they were chasing me. My men were pursuing Mr. Foley because he's delusionary and potentially dangerous. This room, delusionary also? No. There is a closed ride, which we use to... - I'd better take a look at it. - Maybe we'd better look at it. Right here. Counterfeit bills, out of this machine. - Is this true? - 'Fraid so, officer. 'Fraid we've been caught red-handed, right, Ellis? 'Fraid so. Would you like to see them? First quality. Make a run, Donald. We call them Wonder World dollars. Redeemable for admission, rides, souvenirs. It's our big Christmas promotion. We're giving it away to elementary schools across the country. You must be in on this. You supply equipment, he supplies paper, right? They changed it to this shit after I left. - After we leave they'll put it back. - What's this paper? - Ordinary rag. - They switched it. I am tired of these accusations, officers. I want this man arrested for public endangerment. Could I speak with you a moment? God damn it, we spent a fucking year with our noses up DeWald's ass! We're this close to locking this up, and you piss all over us! Our case is blown. You're going back to Detroit, and if you weren't a cop, I'd have you doing dead time in Leavenworth for life. Detective Flint, he's yours. Let's go, Axel. Make sure he doesn't get on the plane. I got a wife, three kids, a mortgage and a pension that won't cut it. That job at Wonder World is my retirement plan. We're being followed. It's the security guards at Wonder World. They probably want to make sure you get on that plane. Because of you, my future is in real fucking jeopardy. DeWald is pissed. Sanderson won't think too highly of me. Hold up! Stop the car! - That liquor store. Stop! - What? - Oh, shit! - Wait! It's all right. Don't worry. I'll get him. When I do, I'll kill him! Axel, I left as soon as I got your call. Are you OK? I'm fine, but I want you to think back to the night Fry disappeared. - Maybe you forgot something. - No. Why would you think that? Because this note by itself... it just don't make no sense. "This is important. Life and death." Why would he even send that? Not "help, I need to talk to you," nothing. Just this. Oh, shit. Fry must have found some sample paper. He knew they'd kill him so he sent it to you. - There's a barcode. - What does that mean? It used to belong to Uncle Sam. Now we got evidence. We can put Sanderson and DeWald's ass in jail. I don't think so. I figured you'd call Uncle Dave here, so we followed him. I actually was a real cop once so I know how you assholes think, which is to say, slowly. Very slowly. So you were carrying the evidence the whole time, Sherlock? Here's the real ending of the story. Let's see if you like it. We heard you were loose. You had a grudge against the park. I feared you might try to harm our beloved Uncle Dave, so I raced over here as fast as I could to try and stop you, but alas, it was too late. Get him all the way in the car. Take it. Take it. You worried about fingerprints? Forget it. Look at the gun. It's yours. Give me your weapon. Throw that gun in the street! Close the door and get over there! Hold on, Uncle Dave. Damn it! Don't you die on me, man. I got an emergency out here. It's a gut shot. Come on! That was Uncle Dave. - Pressure? - 90 over 40 and dropping. I got to get his pressure up. Let's go, guys. I need oxygen. Let's go. On three. One, two, three. Get an arterial line in him. Any medical history? I've been shot before, but it's no big deal. - Where's the coffee machine? - Down the hall. This is an all-city alert for a suspect in the Thornton shooting. Suspect is an African-American male... You hear some black guy shot Uncle Dave? - No? - Come on, let's get out of here. Did you hear? Somebody shot Dave Thornton. - Somebody shot Uncle Dave? - Is there a TV here? Yes, of course. Authorities believe that Foley attacked Uncle Dave in retaliation for some personal rejection. The much-loved Uncle Dave is undergoing surgery at this moment. According to hospital sources, the prognosis is bleak. How does a psycho like that live with himself? Janice, Axel. Get out of the park. They're going to kill whoever knows about Roger Fry's note. Janice can't come to the phone right now. Can I take a message? - If you do anything... - It'll be your fault. I want you at Wonder World within the hour. Come to the main gate alone and unarmed. - And bring the Mint paper. - Then you let us go? If you don't show up here in a half-hour, alone, unarmed and with no cops, I kill your friend. And it wouldn't be the first time, would it? We have an amateur video of the incident this afternoon involving Uncle Dave's assassin, Axel Foley. All right, don't shoot. I'm putting my gun down. I'm putting it on the ground. I'm not armed. Don't shoot. That was an amateur video shot earlier today by a tourist. Would you please take special care of my car? - Yes, sir. - Thank you. - Shit! - Ackwell... Serge, I need a weapon. I don't have any weapon. I take all back. - What about this? - This is the floor model. People been breathing on it, coughing on it... Serge, I need a weapon now. Donny. Donny, Ackwell in some kind of rush, OK? So take the Annihilator and wash it off with some cologne, and take the case and make sure it's nice and pretty. It's Corinthian leather. - Billy, Axel calling. - Axel, listen. Am I your friend? I'm sure you can explain, or maybe you can't explain, but you've got to turn yourself in. - I'm going to Wonder World. - No! Wait for me! Axel! Put your arms out and hold for a pat-down. Foley just arrived, sir. Take him to control. We have Foley. Come on. - How much do you want run? - All of it. - Are you OK? - Let's have the paper. There's a Porsche by the front gate. There's a phone inside. When she calls, I'll give you it. - I don't think so. - Then we got a stalemate. Not quite. Orrin... We kill you both. The paper don't mean jack shit. How you know I didn't mail it to the Secret Service? - He's bluffing. - You think so? Call me. Orrin, I know how cops think. The note is in the car. The keys, Foley. Give me the fucking keys. - Drop that fucking gun! - Again? Drop it! Axel, what are you doing here? - What happened? - It's the coolant safety system. Protects the mainframe in case of fire. - How do we get it open? - We can't. Not from this side. He's trying to use an outside line. Do something! Hello, police? Shit! Foley's loose in the park! I repeat... Foley's loose in the park! Get him! Mr. DeWald! We gotta do something. Call for help! There's just the modem line for the computers. I got it! Just let the computer dial... The phone would just ring and ring. That's it. What good would that be? A lot of good. We can call Flint's pager. Foley is in Hometown Square. Repeat, Foley is in Hometown Square. Foley is heading for Alien Attack. Attention. This is a red alert. Aliens are invading the city. Board the subway trains for immediate evacuation. He ran up those stairs. I need that right away! Damn it. Not again. Excuse me. Dispatch, this is Flint. Trace that number that keeps calling me. 555-4085. It's a computer line at the Wonder World theme park. Call and tell them their computer's broken. We tried, but all the voice lines are down. Must be that Uncle Dave shooting. - Jesus! Somebody shot Uncle Dave? - Some fool named Axel Foley. Where the fuck is he? Get to a phone and call the police. I'll try and find Axel. All right! There you are. Foley's... Name's Wild Bill Rosewood. I'm the sheriff of this town. What the hell happened here? Shit! Damn it! Turn that fucking song off! Foley? You all right? - Hello, Fulbright. - You hurt bad? Look, Foley, I guess I owe you an apology. You were right. I got Sanderson handcuffed in the car. He was in on it, right? I found out about another partner that was in on it. So long, Foley. You OK? Any chance you can explain any of this to me? Like why the fuck am I shot? You guys OK? - Are you OK? - I'm fine. I wonder what time the park opens. He needs medical attention. - Does this hurt? - Don't touch it. I am so happy to introduce to you our new character in Wonder World, named after a man who's most responsible for my being here today. Axel Fox! I don't think you've seen the Tunnel of Love ride, have you? I didn't know y'all had a Tunnel of Love ride in Wonder World. There will be shortly.
