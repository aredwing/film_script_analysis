I've always meant to have that thing speeded up. It's a fine time to think of it. [ Clock Chiming ] [ Chiming Stops ] Free man. - You're not wasting any time, eh? - Not if I can help it. Where do you plan to go? London. It's being heavily bombed these nights. Don't you think some quiet town at first, and get employment there for a while? I'm going to spend the first month being pushed and jammed... by the biggest crowds I can find. I want to hear people talk and laugh. After that clock, a sea of faces will be a good tonic. Well, I don't blame you. I'll walk to the gate with you. [ Gate Latch Rattling ] One parting thought, Neale: Don't get involved with the police again in any way. A second charge wouldn't be easy. - A quiet life from here on. - Well, good-bye and good luck. Thank you. [ Lively ] [ People Laughing ] - Good evening to you. - Evening. Ticket to London, please. Yes, sir. In the wink of an eye. [ Continues ] - What's happening over there? - That's our charity fte. The ladies are doing themselves proud tonight. You might like to have a look at it and spend a shilling or two. - It's well worth it. - May I leave my things here? Certainly. Put 'em right there on the bench. - I'll keep me eye on 'em. - Thank you. - Good evening. - Evening. - Will you join our party? - Yes. The charge is a shilling. Doesn't seem quite fair though. It's so late. If you wait five minutes, you could go in at the reduced price. - It's all right. - I always think it's fair to warn people. We don't want them to feel cheated, even in a good cause, do we? No, no. What is the cause? Mothers of the Free Nations. [ Child ] Catch it! Thank you. Come, now, children. Come along. It's getting toward blackout time. Now we'll have the treasure hunt. Go and get your spades and dig, and mind the vicar's petunias. Now, run along. Run on. Young gentleman... won't you buy a ticket and guess its weight? It's a shilling. Whoever is closest wins it. - All right. - [ Laughs ] Thank you. - Oh, uh, three pounds five ounces. - [ Laughing ] A very good guess, I should say. Your wife must have been teaching you. I have no wife. Now you must try the fortune-teller's. You really must. Mrs. Bellane is wonderful. She told my son-- I was just telling this gentleman about Mrs. Bellane and my son. - Eh-- - Oh, I'll see her. Oh, thanks. How nice. Oh, isn't he a lovely gentleman? Sit down... and cross my palm with silver. Your hand. You're up to date here. Electric light. First the character, then the past. By law I'm not allowed to tell the future. Aha. You have found true contentment in a happy marriage. - I am not married. - Then you will be, heaven help the woman. Oh, don't be angry, please. I haven't had as much pleasure in two years. - I mean it. - Really? Well, then, let's get on with it. Now the past. This line that runs here-- You have made one woman happy. Is something wrong? No. Nothing. Forget the past. Just tell me the future. My instructions are these: What you want is the cake. You must give the weight... as 4 pounds 15 1/2 ounces. - Well, is it the right weight? - That's immaterial. Don't I hear any more fortune? No. You can go now. Well, thank you. I'll try it. [ People Laughing, Chattering ] - I would like to buy another chance. - Bravo! That's a splendid idea! Splendid! I would say 4 pounds 15 1/2 ounces. [ Laughing, Chattering Stops ] Lawks! Anybody could tell you're a bachelor. As a matter of fact, the gentleman has won it. He's not more than a fraction of an ounce out. You'd better not eat too much. It'll be heavy as lead. On the contrary. It's made with real eggs. There you are. - Thank you. - Thank you. [ Vehicle Approaching ] [ Brakes Squeal ] Yoo-hoo! Yoo-hoo! Will the gentleman with the cake please wait? Oh, I've made a terrible mistake about the weight. I'm so sorry, but it wasn't what you said. The real weight is three pounds and two ounces... and the other gentleman won it. - What gentleman? - There, with Mrs. Bellane. - What did he guess? - [ Laughing ] Oh, much closer. Three pounds and eight ounces. In that case, I still win. My first guess was three pounds and five ounces. Give the gentleman this shilling and tell him you're awfully sorry. - Good night. - But-- You don't find many good cakes these days. I told you it'd be worthwhile. Here's an empty one where you can stretch out and sleep. There's no reading with those dim-out lights. And keep the curtains drawn. - All right. - The blasted Nazis'll be over in a bit. The red alert just went up. I hope our lads give 'em a proper pasting. - Well, good night, sir. - Good night. Thank you. - Hope they don't bomb the railway. - I hope. [ Tapping ] Is there space here for one more? It's empty except for me. Come in. - Here. - [ Whistle Blowing ] - That's right. - Thanks. - You're very kind. - Not at all. Good to have company. [ Brakes Screech ] [ Engine Chugging ] Going through to London? Yes. They say the red's up. So I was told. It seems strange to hear people... tell of the blackout. I guess I'm better off than most... at getting about in the dark. I haven't been out much at night myself. I hear the bombers overhead every night. They pass over my farm on their way to London. It's a dread sound. Yes, it is. [ Train Whistle Blowing ] - Would you like some cake? - Cake? Yes. I won it back there at the fte. You might as well share it with me. It's a long way to a London restaurant. Well, if you're going to have some-- Here you are. Ah. Feel how light it is. Made with eggs. You'd think it was made with gold, the way they wanted to hang on to it. [ Airplanes Passing Overhead ] I hear them now. - What? - The Nazis. [ Airplane Engines Grow Louder ] [ Explosions ] They must be trying for the Blackmoor Factory. [ Explosions Continue ] [ Loud Explosion ] Some low buildings about a mile. That's it. It's a munitions plant. [ Bombs Whistling ] [ Bombing Noises Fade ] [ Door Creaking ] Excuse me. There didn't seem to be anyone here. - What do you want? - I'm looking for Mr. Rennit. I'm Mr. Rennit. You should have made an appointment. Evidently you don't want clients. Good morning. Now, now, now, now. You don't want to lose your temper. I'm a busy man. There are ways of doing things. Take a chair, and we'll both have a drink. - Not a bad idea. - It's an excellent idea. These raids-- bad for the nerves. One must have a little something. One gets rattled. You'll excuse a teacup? I've never objected to stimulants... as stimulants. - Your health. - I may need it. Now, to business. - Your name? - Stephen Neale. Hmm. Have you a pencil? Thank you. How did you happen to come to me? Because I don't like my hotel room being ransacked while I'm out at breakfast. I don't like being robbed on trains or shot at. Mr. Neale... this is a respectable business with a tradition. I'm not Sherlock Holmes. A man in my position doesn't go crawling about floors... with a microscope looking for bloodstains. If you're in that kind of trouble, you should go to the police. I don't wish to be mixed up with the police. I'm sorry. It would've been worth 20 to have you come with me. 20, eh? - W-Well, let's get on with it. - I see. Yes, war plays the devil with a business like this. Come on. [ Typewriter Keys Clacking ] You come in if there's trouble. Yes? - Good afternoon. - Good afternoon. I'm looking for the address of a Mrs. Bellane. - No lady of that name works here. - She was helping with your charity fte at Lembridge. [ Chuckles ] Oh, they were voluntary helpers. I'm sorry. We can't possibly disclose... the addresses of the voluntary helpers. Well, isn't there some way I can get it? A mistake was made. She gave me a cake that didn't belong to me. Well, it's against the rules... but I'll inquire. [ People Laughing ] Will you come through, please? Come in, won't you? [ Laughs ] I'm terribly sorry... but I couldn't help it. People have baked some sad-looking pastries to sell at our ftes... - but was it as frightful as all that? - "Frightful"? That you'd come all the way from Lembridge to give it back. He hasn't any cake with him. Have a chair. You know, my sister has a-- a grim sense of humor. Well, if it had been any good, he'd have eaten it. May I ask your name? - Stephen Neale. - I'm Willi Hilfe. - Carla, Mr. Neale. - How do you do? Who was it you wanted? A Mrs. Bellane. Bellane... Bellane. I don't remember any name like that. We have so many of them. - Do you know her? - No. Look in the index. Well-- You're not supposed to give, uh-- Why do you want it? We got along quite famously, and I'd like to see her next time I'm down... find out how the mix-up happened. Oh, I see. You got along famously? - Yes. - Didn't her husband object? Has she a husband? It sounds like it. - "Missus." - Yes, it does, doesn't it? [ Willi ] "Bell"..."Belden"... "Bellane." Here she is. Mrs. Rolf Bellane, a clairvoyant. - Is that the one? - Yes. But she lives here in London. Canon Topping recommended her. - Here you are. - Thank you. Could any of your volunteers be using this organization as their shield? - For what? - Some kind of crime. Our dear old dowagers? Oh, no! He tried to kill you? There's just one bullet left. He'd have used that if the bomb hadn't got him. But it's-- it's-- it's fantastic. The whole thing. I'd like to investigate this Mrs. Bellane with you, Neale. - I'd like to have you. - Oh, no, Willi. Please. If they tried to kill Mr. Neale... something might happen to you. Nonsense. If they use our charity ftes, I want to find out about it. - You may be right, Mr. Hilfe. - Ah. She's just tired of getting me out of scrapes. Got me out of Austria, as a matter of fact. Grow some gray hairs, Afferl. You'll be stunning. Come on, Neale. - Good-bye. - Good-bye. - What do you want? - [ Clearing Throat ] - I-Is this Mr. Finney? - No. No? I didn't think so. [ Children Shouting, Chattering ] [ Klaxon Horn Honks ] Is Mrs. Bellane at home? - Who is calling, please? - Mr. Hilfe... secretary of the Mothers of the Free Nations. Will you come in? Will you please wait a moment? - Oh, I see. - She's not the one. - Mr. Hilfe? - I'm Mr. Hilfe. - Uh, Mrs.-- - Bellane, yes. I've heard many of the ladies speak of you. I should have paid a call at your office long ago. I would have enjoyed it. May I present Mr. Neale? Mr. Neale, are you one of our group? By adoption, yes. [ Man ] Mrs. Bellane? - Oh, I-- I beg your pardon. - We'll start at once, Doctor. I have a group waiting for a sance. Won't you join us? We can talk afterwards. Yes, we'd like to. Splendid. I want to tell you about our fte at Lembridge. We took in over 100. Oh, uh, were you there? Yes. I told fortunes. I'm so sorry to keep you waiting. You especially, Mr. Newby. I know you have to catch the early train. Not at all. Can you make room for Mr. Hilfe over there, Doctor? - Certainly. - This is Dr. Forrester. Mr. Hilfe. And you, Mr. Neale, over there. - Mr. Newby. - How do you do? Miss Penteel. She has extraordinary powers of painting the inner world. Colored rhythmic arrangements. Will you please form the circle? Now, if you will all join hands... before the lights fade. We mustn't break the circle. - The lights will-- - [ Footsteps ] Oh, Mr. Cost. I didn't think you were coming. Always those customers at the last moment. May I? May I present our newcomers? Mr. Neale, Mr. Cost. - How do you do? - It seems we've met before. I'm sorry. I don't believe I recall it. This is Mr. Hilfe, secretary of the Mothers of the Free Nations. - How do you do? - How do you do? The lights will fade now. [ Ethereal Whispering, Indistinct ] [ Mrs. Bellane ] Yes? Yes? I can't hear you. [ Whispering Continues ] One of you won't... let her come through. Someone whose motives are evil. [ Whispering Continues ] [ Mrs. Bellane ] You can speak. There is no enemy here. [ Female Voice, Whispering ] I had to find you. I watched it too, Stephen. Stephen, you sat there... watching the clock. I know. You waited for me to die. Was the poison strong enough? The clock stood still. You killed me. The poison! The clock stood still. You murdered! Who speaks? Who said that? - Don't break the circle! - Who told you that? - [ Gun Fires ] - [ People Screaming ] - Turn on the light! - Turn on the light! The light! Cost! Look at Cost! What happened, Doctor? Look after her, will you? A doctor's no good, I'm afraid. There's only one thing to do: call the police. He did it! He broke the circle! All our hands were locked! I didn't kill him. - You have that revolver. - But I didn't fire it. There was only one bullet left. It's still there. You hold him here, Mr. Hilfe. I'll ring up the police. I'll not be drawn into this. You will excuse me. I have to catch my train. [ Dr. Forrester ] I'd advise you to stay, Newby. The police will want all of us. Well, I'll not wait in here, with him. Then go into the library. [ Woman ] Wait for me, Mr. Newby. [ Door Closes ] You have to believe me, Hilfe. I've only your word for it that there was one bullet. It's the truth! I'm done if the police arrest me again, and someone here knows it... - knows all about me. - But why would they kill him? I don't know. He's the one who came to Lembridge for the cake. Oh, I see. Give me a chance to find out, Hilfe. I'll never clear myself behind bars. I'd like to, Neale... but I'd be in trouble myself if I let you go. I'm an alien. You know what? You might knock me out. Go ahead. It's a good alibi. But get away from London. Well, I've never said "thank you" this way before. [ Children Chattering ] [ Bell Tolling ] [ Phone Ringing ] Mothers of the Free Nations. Mr. Neale? This is Carla Hilfe. Is your brother there? No. There's a fte at Bloomsbury. He wanted to see if there was anything-- anything like Lembridge. - He told you what happened? - Yes. He said the police didn't hold any of the others. They're searching for you. [ Chuckles ] I can imagine. Where will you hide? I don't know yet. I thought I had a place... but it seems my unknown friends got there first. Where are you now? Longacre and Bend? Wait there for me. [ Air Raid Siren Wailing ] [ Man ] Come along. Keep off the streets. Down in the Tube. There's the entrance. [ Man ] Clear the streets, please. I was afraid you'd be gone. The air raid. - I would have waited. - I know a place. We can't get through now. A girl I helped out of Austria... hid there until I got her papers straightened out. Down to the Tube, please. Come along. We expect them over at any moment. This way, please. [ Siren Continues Wailing ] - It's hot, isn't it? - Yes. - Carla. - What? I wonder if you realize what it means... to stand all alone on a dark corner... knowing that somewhere one person is coming towards you to help. Yes. It was that way the first night I stepped off the boat... in England. It changed things. I thought at first I could let you help without telling you the truth, but-- You didn't kill him? No. Not Cost. I was sentenced here in London two years ago... for murder. What the voice said at the sance. - Your brother told you? - Yes. "Murderer." Perhaps I was, if thinking of the thing... for months before you do it makes you one. Lying awake every night thinking of it... until at last you go out and buy the drug. I bought it to kill my wife. She'd been ill for more than a year, slowly wasting away. She couldn't stand the pain any longer... and the doctors couldn't help her. We'd come all the way from her plantation in Africa... and the doctors couldn't do a thing. She begged me then, day after day. I got the drug for her... carried it home. Then I couldn't go through with it. I hid it in a drawer... and she found it. I didn't know until just before she died. The pain was gone then. She smiled... and held my hand while she fell asleep. I sat there for hours holding her hand... watching the clock. Then it was dawn... and there wasn't any more pain. The court called it a mercy killing. Sent me to an asylum. I wasn't mad, you see... but the law called for it. I don't know if I was right even now. Anyway, you know. Yes. - It makes a difference? - No. I'd still like to help. What? He was the one at Rennit's office. [ Subway Rumbling ] [ Brakes Screeching ] [ "All Clear" Siren Sounding ] All clear. What time is it? Almost 5:00. Did you sleep? I thought our friend with the fingernails might come back. You won't need to worry where I'm taking you. Let's leave. Here we are. Not a word. No murder, no Bellane, nothing. - Why would the police keep it quiet? - I don't know, but they have. Probably want to keep me happy. Ah, Miss Hilfe. Come in. Come in. I'm sorry to disturb you so early, Mr. Newland... but I had to see you. You don't visit me often enough. And who is this young man? - Mr. Neale. Mr. Newland. - How do you do? In trouble, eh? Come along. You are very lucky, Mr. Neale... having this young lady for a friend. She's always helping people. - You aren't Austrian? - No, British. He has to hide for a few weeks. He isn't guilty, but the police are looking for him. Fine, fine. The room where Maria stayed, eh? - Do you mind? - Not at all. - [ Carla ] What is it? - Noticed a book here-- The Psychoanalysis of Nazidom, by Dr. Forrester. That's selling very well. Bring a copy along, if you'd like. - Thank you. I will. - Who is Dr. Forrester? He's a psychiatrist. Getting quite famous here. Sort of advisor to the Ministry of Home Security. Writes propaganda. Interesting fellow too. Purchases books from me now and then. Here you are. - [ Bell Jangles ] - Customers! Sometimes I loathe people who like to read. Customers. "Ministry for Home Security." That's a nice place to be an advisor-- at the heart of Britain's defense system. - You don't think he's a-- - He's a friend of Mrs. Bellane's... and Cost wasn't after that cake because he was hungry. But that doesn't make the doctor a spy... just because he went to a sance, any more than you or Willi. I wonder if they're listed in your volunteers. Oh. Now the Mothers of the Free Nations.... are turning into a spy ring. Next you'll have me one. No. You don't look like one. Well, you can forget it. Willi and I have run that office for three years. And your dear old dowagers. I know. But Mrs. Bellane was listed. Why not some of the others? Dr. Forrester, Cost, Newby, Miss Penteel? The artist? Was she there? You know her? I've never met her, but... she has a studio in the Old Arts Centre. She auctioned off some paintings for us. The volunteer? Yes. I'm going back to the office and look through every card in our files. - Still angry? - Of course. A woman always hates to be wrong. Good. Will you have dinner with me tonight? I'll meet you here. [ Doorbell Chiming ] Well, Mr. Neale. You do get about. I was just thinking the same. Aren't you afraid of the police? When they're nearby, yes. It'd be a shame if they found you there. The building has a bad enough reputation. Won't you come in? - Going to hold a sance here? - No. The last one was quite enough for a while, thanks to you. - You don't trust me? - No. - Where's Miss Penteel? - Shopping. It's just as well. You frightened her to death once already. Won't you sit down? Whiskey and soda? Thank you. What did you have against Mr. Cost? I didn't kill him, and you know it. You're most attractive when you're lying. I'd even enjoy hearing you say you were interested in me. I am. How did you know about me? That microphone, or whatever it was. I always try to frighten people the first time they come to a sance. They love it. I never thought it would make you start shooting. How did you know about me? Your trial testimony was in all the papers... and my assistants keep an excellent file on people. They couldn't have looked me up as quickly as all that. You'd be surprised. You surprise me continually. Did it ever occur to you that some women like affection... even better than conversation? So do some men... if they're sure they're not going to be shot any moment. Take the bullets out of it if you want to. I only carry it for protection. You don't miss much. I seem to be missing a lot today. You're a strange person. I tell you all my trade secrets, and still you don't trust me. Why did you say you told fortunes at Lembridge? Why? Because I did. I was there. You weren't the one who told mine. Oh! That female battleship... with the moons and stars? - That's the one. - She was some Lembridge woman. She wanted to keep the booth open after I left and practice her palmistry. Well, she did, and I got the cake. I suppose you don't know about that either. Of course. But how did you get it? - What was in it? - I don't know. Was there supposed to be something in it? That's the truth. The lady in the cake booth... asked me to let her gentleman friend win it. If someone came to me and said, "Don't bother about the past. Tell me the future," I was to give him the correct weight. - Did you say that? - Something like it. Oh, well, that explains it. Now are you happy? I've got exactly nowhere. - Neither have I. - [ Doorknob Rattles ] Come in, Martha. Police! Help! Murder! Police! Police! - She would. - I'll keep the gun. To remember me by? You might need it. You should know. Won't I see you again? Yes. [ Door Opens ] Oh, there you are. I was worried about you last night. - That was a pasting. - I know. I got caught in it. What's this? A housecleaning? It's going to be. We've been patriotically slaving for three years... to help a spy ring. What? Oh, nonsense! Here. Look at these. "Adamson." Never heard of him. "Aiken." Both recommended by Dr. Forrester. - "Alpock." - Dr. Forrester. - "Cost." - Newby, Penteel. All those at the sance. All recommended by Dr. Forrester. And he works for the Ministry of Home Security. - How did these get in our files? - I don't know. Get Mrs. Merrick in here. [ Buzzer Sounds ] Yes? Do you know how these cards got here? "Mr. Aiken." Oh, yes. I remember filing him. His name struck me as so odd. This is one of the batches you mailed me. - I mailed you? - Yes, from Kent... while you were on your holidays last year. - I've never seen them before. - Oh, but I'm sure, Miss Hilfe. They're just as you always send them from meetings and such. I, uh-- I may be wrong. Thank you, Mrs. Merrick. Oh, not at all. They even know how we mail our cards. They're Nazis, Willi. I know it. The same as they were in Austria. It's the way they work-- all around you... knowing about everybody, everything-- where to find you. - That night they hunted us-- - Carla. Not the old fear again? We aren't there now. - But they're here, in London. - You're imagining too much. Something's going on... but you can't charge people with being Nazis... just because they belong to a-- to a charity... especially an advisor to the Ministry. - The police would laugh at us. - That is what I told Stephen, at first. - Stephen? - Mr. Neale. He's the one that thought of searching the cards, and he was right. I'm going to show them to him. Wait a minute. How did you get in touch with him? He telephoned for you. He's safe now. I took him to the bookshop where I hid Maria. - I wish you hadn't done that. - Why not? You're helping him. Yes, I know. But I'd rather you didn't get mixed up with him. But why, Willi? You don't think he killed that man, Cost? I didn't... then. I've checked up on him. He was sentenced for murder two years ago. He told me. But it wasn't murder. Even the court called it a mercy killing. And you still want to help him? Yes. You're not, uh, falling in love with him, by any chance? Yes... very much. I can go to the Ministry of Home Security... at least try to tell them. They'd suspect you before anyone else. It's your organization. You're aliens. You can't take that chance. We took longer chances than this in Austria. You're not afraid? - Yes. - Good. So am I. When I left Lembridge, I told Dr. Morton... I was coming to London to spend a quiet life. It's been like riding down the side of a whirlpool. From what you say about the Ministry... Willi and I are only a half turn behind you. We'll get out of it, all right... even if I have to drown some of these Free Mothers first. - You wouldn't object? - No. Someday, when I get back to that quiet life, I-- I want to ask you if you'd be interested in it too. Willi asked me if I was falling in love with you. And? I said... yes. [ Phone Ringing ] Newland's Bookshop. Oh, Dr. Forrester. A pleasure to hear from you, sir. I've found a set for you. Oxford Medicine, by Christian. Nineteen volumes. Is that correct? Tonight? I don't know. You're quite far out. Oh, here? Just a moment. Regal... Court... flat... twenty-nine. Has the porter a key? Right. I'll have it there before blackout time. Miss Hilfe, did you hear that? Yes. Nineteen volumes! Are you two going out to get some dinner tonight? - We'll drop them off for you. - Would you? Thank you very much. A book is all right for mental stimulation... but if there's anything I loathe, it's struggling about the streets... with great quantities of print. You spoke of the porter. Won't the doctor be there? No. He's out at his nursing home. Has a collection of maniacs he psychoanalyzes. It's Regal Court, flat 29. The porter will let you in. Put them anywhere. And please don't forget my valise. Leather's hard to get. All right. Thank heaven for youth and strength. [ Man ] Twenty-nine? Yes, sir. Mr. Travers left orders to let you in. "Travers"? But these are for Dr. Forrester. You must be wrong, sir. We haven't any Dr. Forrester. But 29 is right, and Mr. Travers is expecting books. We have had some incorrect names, sir, where a gentleman has a hideout from his wife... but those gentlemen were not spending their time with books. - There you are, sir. - Thank you. Not at all, sir. "Travers," eh? [ Neale ] He needs a few books! Nobody lives here. No cigarettes, no personal belongings, nothing. The line's dead. We'll save Mr. Newland's leather and get out of this place. [ Fuse Hissing ] Awake, eh? You've been hard to find, Mr. Neale. Who was the girl? - What girl? - That went into the flat with you. - I was alone. - You were when we found you. - The porter saw her go in. - That's very interesting. A mysterious girl. I don't see her, and you don't... but the porter does. Did you kill her too? You're much better at that occupation... with your bombs in suitcases. Oh, now it's my bomb, eh? Or one of your Nazi friends. Nazis, bombs. They shouldn't have let you out of that asylum, Mr. Neale. - We ought to have a record of all this. - I've said all I have to say. You'll say quite a bit more before you leave here. [ Mock Chuckle ] And just where am I? Scotland Yard. - Where'd you think? - [ Door Opens ] Inspector. Stephen Neale. Questioning by Inspector Prentice. File number 2H-LJ-14. Charge: murder. I didn't kill him. - Who didn't you kill? - Cost, at Mrs. Bellane's place. We haven't heard about that one. But the police were there when we had the sance. There's been no such murder reported. A friend of mine saw them. They questioned him. What friend? You wouldn't know him. - They must have posed as police too. - Who? The people at the sance, the ones who tried to kill me. They're enemy agents-- Mrs. Bellane, Dr. Forrester, the psychiatrist. Forrester? Not the advisor to the Ministry? Yes. He telephoned Newland at his bookshop to kill me with that bomb. Have the doctor give him a sedative. I'll talk to him later. Wait. You asked for the truth, you listen to it. I have all their names. Look at the cards in my coat. There weren't any cards in your coat. Spies, sances-- You've been very careful not to mention George Rennit. - Rennit? - When you're ready to tell me... what you did to him, let me know. I didn't do anything to him. No, I didn't think so. Of course you didn't. He left his office with you. Wasn't seen again alive. His body was found near Battersea Bridge. He was bludgeoned. You are charged with his deliberate murder. I don't know what happened to him. I didn't even know he disappeared... until I got back to his office. Well, that's better. You were with him, then. Yes, I retained him to find out why they tried to kill me. They were after something hidden in a cake that I won. Cake? I know I sound insane. You are, without doubt. Inspector, wait, please. I know my record. You can send me back to the asylum on any charge. I don't care what you do with me. But you can't take it on yourself... to say that German agents aren't working here in London. You saw that bombed apartment. I tell you, they did it. - I ask you for one fair chance to prove it. - Name it. It's a long chance, but it's the only one I have. There's a bomb crater at Blackmoor Factory near Lembridge. I want to search it to see if there's any trace of what was in that cake. There was a cake. Where was he standing? Here, by the corner. Here. Cover every bit of ground. Here is a coat. Or what's left of it. - The blind man's? - Yes. [ Object Clatters ] It's the piece from that gun. - Rather convenient for you to find it. - At least I was here. It might be your gun that you used on him. There's nothing about spies on it. - Inspector, is this anything? - The cake box. Or part of it. - Where was it? - The edge of the crater. A bird was pecking away at it. Where did he find it? It must be here somewhere. If we could sift this dirt-- Drive over to the factory. Get some screens and shovels. Yes, sir. He was ruddy well scattered about. That does it, sir. Satisfied? - Pack up. - Very good, sir. [ Birds Chirping ] I never used to like birds. What is it? Drawings or something. We'll ask the Ministry. [ Film Projector Clicks ] Watkins, turn it off. I don't know how they could have been photographed. I assume full responsibility. They've only been out of the vault twice-- for the Saturday conference... and yesterday. They would have killed more than one man to recover these, Mr. Neale. They're the new embarkation plans and our Channel minefields. - We've been a great help. - Mr. Neale can identify some of them, sir. With your permission, I'll get along with arresting them. - They might still have prints. - I doubt it... or they wouldn't have gone to such lengths to recover the negative. I don't think we can take it for granted that the charts are safe. I don't either, sir. I think someone came here and photographed them... again yesterday. You said that they were out of the vaults again. - Yes. - This Dr. Forrester-- He hasn't been here for two weeks. He's done splendid work for the Ministry, Inspector. - Hard to believe that he's involved. - Perhaps not, sir. Were any of his friends here both days? Not that I know of. That tailor he recommended was here again yesterday. Measured Parkins for a suit. Mr. Travers? - May I speak, sir? - Surely. Someone named Travers leased that apartment... where Inspector Prentice found me. - Could you tell me his firm, sir? - Travers and Brathwaite. May I use your phone? Thank you, sir. Would you get me Travers and Brathwaite, tailors? Are you there? This is Mr. Pauling. Would it be possible to be measured for a suit this afternoon? Thank you. With your permission, sir. Mrs. Bellane, Miss Penteel, Old Arts Centre. She keeps yelping for the police every time she sees me. Newland, Newland's Bookshop. That's all. Bring 'em in. Yes, sir. Why are you protecting that girl? - There wasn't any girl. - And that friend you mentioned? I've told you everything I know that can be of help. My friends have nothing to do with it. I don't want them involved. That's a fair answer. Follow me in five minutes. - Good afternoon. - Oh, good afternoon. - What can we do for you, sir? - I'd like to see Mr. Travers, please. Certainly, sir. Won't you please take a chair? I'll tell him you're waiting, sir. The gentleman over there, sir. One moment, Mr. Pauling. - Good tweeds here, Travers. - Thank you, sir. - Good afternoon, Mr. Travers. - Good afternoon. You wish to see me, sir? There's no one I'd rather see. I don't understand. Excuse me one moment. Hello. Mr. Macklin? This is Travers and Brathwaite. Your suit was dispatched an hour ago, sir... I trust in time for your journey. Thank you very much, sir. I felt very satisfied myself... at the last fitting. Oh, yes, sir. I think when you've worn it once... you'll find the shoulders will settle. No, sir. I find we'll not be able to... repeat the trousers. Oh, it isn't a matter of coupons, sir. The manufacturers have no more of the pattern. Personally, I have no hope, sir. No hope at all. [ Men Talking At Once ] Prentice! Police! [ Neale ] He's Cost, the one at the sance. Excuse me. - There's Travers. - That's Travers, huh? [ Men Chattering ] [ Ringing ] Hello? Is anyone there? - Oh. - Oh. - Why didn't you deliver Mr. Macklin's suit? - I did, guv'nor, just before I came here. - You must've gone to the wrong address. - No, sir. like it had on the box. That's all right, then. Mr. Travers was quite put out. Oh. Neale. Why, Carla said-- Come in here, man. We thought you'd been killed. Not quite. Carla took me back to that apartment. You disappeared. What happened? - Is she here? - Yes. Carla. [ Chuckles ] Finally saved up enough coupons... to buy a decent suit. Carla. - [ Door Opens ] - [ Carla ] Yes? He isn't a ghost. You'd better tell her. - Why did you come here? - Why not? The man saved your life. Aren't you going to thank him? He'll kill you, Stephen! He's the one who tried to kill us with that bomb. He gives the orders, not Dr. Forrester. [ Clicking Tongue ] There wasn't much else to do. You were both finding out too much, and you wouldn't stop. It was too good a charity to lose. And you'd kill your sister to save it? You killed your wife. People do such things under the strain of necessity. We've always been very close. I was really happy when I found her alive. Put your hat and coat on. We're leaving. Vorwrts! The trouble with me is I like people too much. I liked you at first. That's why I tried to frighten you out of London. I was quite happy letting you hit me on the jaw. I'm fond of that memory myself. But you're a persistent man, Neale. If I had known that you were going to keep on messing about... you would have never left Mrs. Bellane's alive. Are you ready, Carla? - Yes. - It's a pity, Neale. You could have led a very peaceful life. The films are sewed up in that suit, aren't they? Oh, yes. Cost said the shoulders would settle. Killing me won't get you out of England, Hilfe. You're through. [ Shot Fires ] Give me the gun, Carla. Give me the coat. You wouldn't shoot your brother, Carla. [ Shot Fires ] [ Body Thuds ] Come. They're on the stairs. - Can you make it? - Yes. Come on! [ Forrester ] Put out the lights down there! - Are they coming? - I don't know. [ Gunfire ] Get the other magazine out of the coat. I've always dreamed of having a church wedding. We'll have music, flowers, and a big cake. Cake?
