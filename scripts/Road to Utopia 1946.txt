For one reason or another, the motion picture which you are about to see... is not very clear in spots. As a matter of fact, it was made to demonstrate how not to make a motion picture... and at the same time win an Academy Award. Now, someone in what is known as ''the front office''... has thought that an occasional word from me... might help clarify the plot and other vague portions of the film. Personally, I doubt it. Shall we go? It's 8:00, Pa. Bedtime. Put down that paper. In a minute, Ma. In a minute. Land's sakes, pa. Sittin'there night after night pouring your eyes out over that old stock market. Think by now you'd be tired of it. Well, 'tain't easy, ma, to change the habits of a lifetime. Lot of nonsense--all that buyin'and sellin'-- Bulls and Bears. Can't see how a body can figure it out. Right now it's kind of bearish, Ma, kind of bearish. Come along, it's 8:00. I'm not a child. I know when it's time to go to bed. Pa! It's time. Come on, Pa. Doc says I can stay up till half past. I know, but by the time we get your ears washed and your teeth put away-- All right, I guess. Here we go. Look and see if everything got up with me. #For always # Do you hear what I hear? I hope not. That voice. What voice? Listen. What does it sound like? Who'd be sellin' fish at this hour? After 3 5 years-- Pa, you don't think-- Oh, no, it couldn't be. But it is. That voice. I'd know it anywhere. You would, huh? Shuck and gosh darn it. And I thought this was gonna be an ''A'' picture. Duke! Sal! Duke.! Sal! It isn't true. I don't believe it. Just got in from Alaska and I came right to you. Right from out of the grave. Nice diggin', hmm? My, uh, nieces. Girls, old friends of your uncle's, the Hootons. How do you do? Just think, 3 5 years, Duke. It doesn't seem possible. Sal, let me look at you. You're a sight for sore eyes. And Chester, you're a sight. Don't forget a man is just as young as he feels. Take 'em away. The doctor says I can't have 'em anymore. You've got very little to complain about. You won the girl, got the gold mine-- All this. Things have surely stacked up well for you. Who's doin' your stackin' lately? Chester! Girls, the Hootons and I have a few things to discuss. If you'll run along, Uncle will meet you later at the club. Nice goin', ''Uncle.'' Nice family tree and the limbs ain't bad either. Duke, tell us all about Alaska. We left you for dead. How did you ever get away? It's a long story. I wouldn't want to bore you. It's never stopped you before. Tell us. You remember when it all started. Chester and I were playing San Francisco. The turn of the century. There was gold in the Klondike and San Francisco was wide open. A million suckers just waitin' to be clipped. There was excitement and adventure. There was romance. And one night, you remember, there was murder. This is a device known as ''the flashback.'' Okay, George. Gold! Millions! Open up. What happened? Sperry, McGurk... the window. What is it, Mr. Lattimer? They got it-- The map, your father's mine. The police will get them. Never. They're too smart. But Mr. Lattimer-- Alaska-- Go to Skagway. Ask for Ace Larson. Ace Larson? Where do I arrange my passage? No time, lady. Get it on board. - Take it away,Joe. - Right, Cap. You better hurry, we're shovin' off. Thank you. Take it away, boys. Hey, look! We've gotta get on that boat. Too late, mister. Next boat's tonight at midnight. Extra.! Murder in Hotel Room. Read all about it. Map of Van Hoyden Mine Stolen. Extra.! Read all about it.! It's them! Who? Sperry and McGurk. ## # Everybody here knows Good Time Charlie # # Charlie is a perfect clown # #Always kills the folks with funny jokes # #And turns the parlor upside down # # Everybody sure likes Good Time Charlie # # No one ever saw him frown # # But here's the funniest part # # Down deep in his heart # # He's the lonesomest man in town # Charlie, why are you on this mad, mad merry-go-round? Ha, ha, ha. I'm your friend. You can tell me, Charlie. You're wasting your life away. Someday you'll be old and all alone. Think it over. You're not fooling me, Charlie. It's your childhood sweetheart. But you're a great, great man. Great to take it the way you have. You're doin' the right thing. Laugh! Ha, ha, ha. Dance! Play the fool! # He's the lonesomest man in town # #The lonesomest man in town # Three, a-two, a-three, a-four. # He's always good for a laugh # # But... you don't know the half # # He's only happy-go-lucky # #Till the lights are turned down # #Then he's the lonesomest man in town ## And now, to go from the super to the supernatural, we bring you ''Ghost-O,'' the most amazing novelty game of the age, stolen at great personal risk... from the high priest of the Lost Tribe of Darkest Anesthesia... and brought to these shores by that great oriental mystic... and secret Hindu potentate, professor Hakin Zambini.! And now, ''Ghost-O''... and the man who has brought fortunes to thousands of lucky people, professor Zambini. Holy Toledo! Holy Toledo! Bushwa. Silence, dear friends. I shall attempt to contact the other world. Master, shall I remove myself? The spirit will do it for us. Ala-kaballa, presto-sturgando, double-forzando. Silence! Silence, dear friends. I feel the presence of spirits in the room. What I do for money. Matoom-bomba. Diddy-wa-diddy matoom-bomba. Diddy-wa-diddy, ester-chay. The oint-jay is ull-fay of ump-chays-- Ump-chays-- There's one here, too. Spirits, are you with us? Are you there? Am I there? Where can I go? - Are you there? - If I was, I wouldn't be here. Spirits, are you with us? That's the spirit! We have made contact. To prove it, I shall have the spirit do my bidding. Spirit, lift the table. Spirit, lift.! The flesh is willing but the spirits are weak. However, we shall proceed with the magic game of Ghost-O. Taking this fabulously jeweled box, I shall place a five-dollar bill therein, close the box regretfully, incant a few magic words thereover, and gamble upon the generosity of the spirits. Matoom-bomba Ester-chay, willet-gay under-day dwit-ay matoom-bomba. What have we here? A crisp ten-dollar bill. Indeed, the spirits are generous tonight. Why am I monopolizing this lucrative phenomenon? Who among you would like to try for 1 0, 20, 30 dollars-- any small amount? I'll try for a dollar. A dollar? An assignment for one of the smaller spirits; however, a buck is a buck and the spirits are always in there. Matoom-bomba matoom a-double-bomba. A crisp new five-dollar bill. Five for one. Here you are. Who among you shall be next? 10 dollars! I'll try for 15. We are building, however, it's a big box and there's room in there for both of you. The spirits will have to take dead aim this time. Atch-it-way, Ester-chay. Matoom-bomba, Sam-cheron on-the-half-shell. Hiya, George! Welcome home, Abe! Looks like a spirit got away with this one, folks. That's the spirit. Sometimes he puts, sometimes he takes. Who's next? Just bring a buck in a truck. Ten dollars. Twenty-five. Twenty dollars here. Don't get shut out. Wait a minute. Let's try in here. There they are! Out the back way! Just a moment, please. They don't seem to think we're on the level. Some people are so suspicious. Ghost-O! I didn't think there was one more way to get the cops after us, but you found it! 50 for Duke, 50 for Chester. 1 0 for Duke, 1 0 for Chester. Some life. Always one jump ahead of the Sheriff. 5 for Duke, 5 for Chester. That boat sails in 20 minutes. Let it sail. Look, mastermind, the tour is over. We've been posse-baitin' every town from coast to coast. We just ran out of towns. From now on, it's oceans and we take boats. A Confederate ten-spot! How can people be so crooked? We're taking the boat to New York. Not that boat. Going the wrong way? It's going south, should be going north. Going north? Where they got that yellow stuff... that ever-lovin' powder. Gold? That's right. Alaska! Yes. No you don't! Alaska? It's so cold... if you shake hands, they take it and throw it away. It's Utopia. Everybody's getting gold. I got all the gold I want in my teeth. I'm takin' my dough to Brooklyn and opening a Turkish bath-- with tables for ladies. Where're you going with all that cabbage? I'm gonna pickle it. Yours? All of it? What happened to 50-50? All of it. You've been leading me by the nose, chiseling me right and left. Me chiseling you? I got a record of every chizz. This is fantastic. It's right here in black and white. Niagara Falls... $300 for hospital bills. All you had to do was find some yokel and send him over the falls in a barrel. It was a great stunt. I almost broke my neck. Pittsburgh, Chicago, and how 'bout Kansas City? You picked my pocket of 7 5 bucks so you could take Mabel Bronschweiger on a buggy. Mabel Bronschweiger. Lady blacksmith. She was your girl. I sat in the hotel lobby while you took her for a ride in the woods. She was in fresh air. Didn't I front for you in Oklahoma? Hilda, the oilman's daughter? Sent you in there. Was she born or did they have to drill for her? $1 200 worth right there, but I'll settle for this. You wanna go to Alaska and be a blubber-ball for a bunch of trained seals? Go ahead, I'm headin' home. I can't stand in your way. If that's the way you feel, that's the way you feel. That's the way I feel about it. Don't start tellin' my fortune. It won't do you any good. What do you think of this? A black nine on a red jack. You use those cards to trick me in every crooked deal we had. No more, I'm too smart. You're wastin' you're time, DukeJohnson. I'm goin' right back where I-- What is it? What's it say? It's nothing. You can say that again. I know those cards. This is amazing! They're as phony as you are. It's lucky I'm smart-- What is it? What do you see? You're not interested. It's a partnership? It's us. We're back in New York. New York? Yes, and we're rich. We're driving down to 5th Avenue in a gold-plated carriage. 5th Avenue? Yeah, we're sittin' there smoking dollar cigars... and we're throwing $50 bills at the round haircuts. 5th Avenue? We just turned down 42nd Street. Wait'll I get back in the carriage. Where you been? You don't want that crowd to get all that dough? Let them have it. We've got billions. Where'd we get it? Utopia. Alaska? Pretty smart. Gave me a fast shuffle, huh? You'd better face it. The cards say Alaska. No wonder, it's a cold deck. This seems to be a scene they put in after I saw the picture in the studio. Obviously a lot of extras-- I don't know. Read all about it. ''Van Hoyden Murderers Still at Large. '' Extra paper. Read all about it. Extra paper. Police Anticipate an Early Arrest. Van Hoyden's Murderers Still at Large. Extra. Hey, boy! See what happened to Happy Hooligan. Careful, don't get hurt. You'll snap off a thumb. Keep it. Well, Chester, looks like the end of the line for you and I. There goes Chester and there goes little old Duke. That's pretty heavy carfare. How're you gonna make it? I'll get along somehow. Don't worry about me. Well, Duke, I guess this is it. I never thought we'd end this way. It's so different. I'm holdin' the dough and you're holdin' the bag. I never thought I'd have the biggest end. You've always had much the biggest end. Where do you keep your butter? It was great while it lasted. What a combo. Lot of laughs. Lot of snickers. We had a couple of things that money couldn't buy. I usually got the ugly one. No hard feelings. No hard feelings at all. So long. So long. Well, see ya. Chester? Huh? I can't let you go like this. Not without letting you know... whatever happens, you can always count on me. That's fine, Duke, just fine. I want you to feel that whatever I have is yours. Somehow I feel that whatever you have is mine. Duke, that little speech touched me. We're pals. If we want something, we don't have to ask for it. We know it's there and we take it. This is it, son. Let me have one last look at you. Duke-- Don't speak. Don't say it. Go quickly and don't look back. So long, Duke! Good-bye, Chester. No hard feelings. I forgive you for everything; Hilda, Mabel, the whole works. Even for trying to pick my pocket just now. Why, you dirty rogue! Wait a minute there! Emergency! Look out! I gotta catch a boat! Look out! Out of my way! Out of my way! Whoops! Out of your way. Spread out boys, you're liable to get blood all over you. Chester, whatever seems to be the trouble? ''Trouble,'' he says? ''Don't look back,'' he says? I oughta-- Chester, don't fight this thing. It's too big for you. Like it says in the cards, you're on your way to Alaska. Huh? Alaska? I'm goin' to New York! Stop the boat! Wait! What's goin' on here? Alaska! We're goin' to Alaska! He's gone, this boy-- The gold and everything, Don't listen to that cheap phony. I'm perfectly sane. Would a sane man go to Alaska in a Palm Beach suit? I'm goin' to Brooklyn to open a Turkish bath-- See what I mean? Take him to my cabin. I've handled him before. I don't want to go to Alaska. It's cold there! Icicles, popsicles, Eskimo pies! Take your hands off me. Look, I'm sane. 2 and 2 is 4. 4 and 4 is 8. 8 and 8 is-- [ Duke ] Ahh.! Ahh.! Take me below. He's gone. We've lost this boy. You wouldn't do this if I was in shape. You need any help, just call us. Stand by with a light mallet. Me on a boat to Alaska? Maybe I am crazy. Chester-- Don't give me any talk, just give me my money. Don't you think it would be better if you let me hold the money? Give me that cabbage before I part your derby. If that's the way you feel-- That's the way I feel. Is it all here? Count it. We gotta be careful. This is a strange boat. There's a lot of crooks around. You won't be lonesome. You know way down underneath I'm honest. But on top, you're a rat. That money would be safer in my pocket. You kiddin'? We're not putting the money in your pocket or my pocket, we're puttin' it where it belongs... in the safe. See? Man overboard! Wait! No hard feelings? No hard feelings. It's only money. Has no personality. You and those cards. I can't understand. Must've been a Pinochle deck. Keep scrubbin'! Make it shine! Are you kiddin'? My fingernails are all gone. For the last hour I've been using up the white meat. You'll keep on 'til you work you way back to Frisco! Not me! I've had enough! Me, too! Who do you think you're pushin' around? We're not cattle, you know! Moo! Moo! Thanks. Baked ham around here. Silly place to get a hotfoot. Come on, help yourself. This is no sailboat. I'm doing my share. You look like an agent standing there. That fire's important. Makes the boat go. That's right. Supposing it goes out? Supposing it does? I'm ready. Oh, that's-- Pardon me. Thanks. What do you do around here? Nothing. You in this picture? No, taking a short cut to Stage 1 0. Very fine, Tony. All right, who's next? Let's go, Dad. You're on. I'm not following monkeys this season. They'll think it's an encore. Besides, 1 0 bucks is 1 0 bucks. Don't be bashful. Who's next? Here's your boy. Stay in there. Can I borrow that Stomach Steinway? Take good care of him. You kiddin'? It's got asthma now. ## #You think that money is everything # #And yet it's anybody's spring # # Go make a fortune become a king # #And still it's anybody's spring # #And if you flash a bankroll # # Do you suppose the brook would care # # Or that a rose would say # # ''There goes a millionaire'' # # It's more than diamonds around a ring # # Because it's anybody's spring # #You may be born with the silver spoon # #And yet it's anybody's moon # #You couldn't buy a ticket # #To hear the first robin sing # # It's free because it's anybody's spring # ## I never knew I could play one of these. You could beat the monkey. #You couldn't buy a ticket # #To hear the first robin sing # # It's free because it's anybody's spring ## Very nice. Very nice. Now for the winner. Line up here, please. He's wasting time. Naturally. Next time, I bring Sinatra. Could you tell me where I could find a Mr. Ace Larson? At his place, I reckon-- The Golden Rail. Thank you. So I came up here as fast as I could, Mr. Larson. If you'll only help me, I'll be glad to pay you-- Pay me? You seem to forget, my dear, your father was my best friend. Thank you. Who did you say stole that map? I didn't, but they were seen-- Two men, Sperry and McGurk. Sperry and McGurk, huh? You know them? By reputation only. Two of the blackest cutthroats that ever dirtied up the Klondike. - Maybe the police-- - That won't be necessary. Go down to the dock. I want to know the minute those two hit town. I can't begin to thank you, Mr. Larson. Forget it. What do you do? I beg your pardon? For your living. How do you get by? I sing a little. I like that. From now on, you'll work for me. Now don't you worry your pretty little head about it. Just leave everything to me. You've been terribly sweet. The dirty dog. He just wants to get Dorothy into one of those scanty costumes. Not a bad idea. I'm working for Mr. Larson-- Upstairs. Thank you. Who's the fancy baggage? A little lady who's lost a gold mine. Are you the lost and found department? I'm gonna help her get it back. Aren't you stepping a little out of character? I don't know. The mine's worth about three million dollars. What do we get out of it? About three million dollars. Doesn't leave the ''little lady'' much, does it? That's what I like about you. You're good at arithmetic. The boat docks in Skagway but are we getting off? Oh, no, we're cooked. I didn't want to get on this boat. I was Shangri-La'd. Shanghaied, old man. Well, one of those towns in Egypt. What do you got there? Just an old piece of paper, that's all. What're you puttin' it in your pocket for? I save old paper. Some people save old string. I think folding is more fun than twisting. What is it? Just a map of an old gold mine. What? Just a little one. Good for a couple of inlays maybe. Let's see it. I'm an old map man. It's my type of work. Chester, you realize what this is? It's a map. It's the Van Hoyden gold mine. You read the papers. You think so? The guys that have this room must be the killers. Dirty rats. [ Duke ] We got the map. It's ours. How do you figure? The law of the Yukon-- Possession. How 'bout the murderers? We'll turn them over to the cops. - They should be boiled in oil. - I told you... a gold mine.! I saw it in the cards. Those beautiful cards. Riding down 5th Avenue. Throwing 50-dollar bills at the round haircuts. We'll be living like kings. Living like kings? I abdicate. Nice little mine you got here, fellas. Wear it in good health, boys. Nice to meet you. Come on, Chester. We got a little dust of our own to take care of. Start cleaning up here. That blood. There's no blood there. There's gonna be. No noise. You wanna wake up the neighborhood? This is much better. Yeah? I ain't afraid to die. I just hate being killed. Wait a minute. Think it over. For a couple of years. You wouldn't want to dirty a nice knife over a stale couple of million bucks.! What do we do now? Remember Schenectady? Okay fellas, we're ready. We ain't askin' for no mercy. Can we say our prayers? Okay. Be quick about it. Bailey... Crawford. Bailey... Crawford. No trace of those stowaways, sir. I ain't worried. If they're gettin' off, they've got to come through here. Flannery. Flannery. peters. peters. Lombardi. Lombardi. Sperry. And McGurk. Sperry and McGurk. Sperry and McGurk? Yeah, Sperry and McGurk. What about it, partner? What about it? Nothing, boys. Only, just don't make any trouble. Things are different since you boys were here. It's nice and peaceful. Don't worry, we're law-abiding citizens now. Anybody says we ain't, we'll plug 'em. Hey, Sperry and McGurk just hit town. Sperry and McGurk? Yeah, and they're headed this way. Here they come now! What goes with the local peasantry? One look at us and they run right out of the joint. I feel like I'm back in vaudeville. I don't know what Sperry and McGurk did to this burg, but they're dynamite. We own this town. I'll sell cheap. I don't like it. If those hoodlums ever get off that boat, we'll be smiling from ear to ear with our throats. Forget it. The town's ours-- Food, liquor, supplies, anything. All we got to do is act tough. Tough? Remember, you're Sperry and I'm McGurk. Got it? Got it. Made it. Not quite. It's a leaner. What'd I tell ya? We got the royal suite, dinner, liquor, sled loaded with a month's supplies. Hasn't cost us a dime. Clamber out of that beaver. How'll they know we're Sperry and McGurk? We'll tell 'em. If those two butchers ever get off that boat, we'll wind up hamburger, blood-rare. I don't like it. You don't like it? You don't know a good thing when you see it. This town's a whole big jackpot for us. I don't like it. Skagway Sal wants to see you boys. I'm beginning to like it. Get out of here! We got business. Who'd you say? Skagway Sal. Well, come on in. That's our business. Where does, uh-- hang out? Golden Rail. Looky here, Skunky. Anybody ever see Sperry and McGurk with their beards off? Not that I know of. Spread the news around. They're gonna see it tonight. Okay. Skagway Sal, let's go. Now they're furnishing dates. This is a great town. We're beginning to operate. Sal's waitin'. What's the rush? There's only one dame. You better clamber out of that mattress before somebody asks you for a cough drop. You better let me hold the map. What for? You know how you act when you get around women. The only thing I do is get ''around'' the women. Give me the map. Don't forget, half s mine. Half of it's yours. Here you are. What're you doing? Putting mine in my hat in a safe place. You'd better do the same thing. In a safe place, huh? What do you think of my underwear? Not much, but put it there. Throw that candy away. I got a sweet tooth. We're supposed to be killers... supposed to look tough. The almonds are tough. Lose it. Throw it away. Stash it. Here, Fuzzy. Dessert? Come on. When you get to an elbow, it's mine. Are you crazy? Feedin' a loose pooch? We'll never get rid of him. He's a cute character. Let's take him along. He's as big as a horse. Probably eats like a horse. That runs into a lot of money. You oughta know. Come on. Remember, we're supposed to be Sperry and McGurk. Tough, huh? Very tough. Scat, sad sack. Go on, scat. Beat it before he throws a saddle on you. There they are! How tough could these guys have been? Okay, everybody, go ahead and enjoy yourselves. We ain't in a killin' mood tonight. Just a woundin' mood. Let's get some action here. We're springin' tonight. Champagne for the crowd. That's enough. We're the crowd. At this point the plot is much more interesting from your point of view than mine. This is the life, Pappy. This is awful. What's the matter? I ain't got room for her. I wish I had another leg. What happens when Sal shows up? She'll have to sign an application blank. We may get to her later. ## # Mary Smith had a college education # # SallyJones had a scientific streak # # Susie Brown used to lecture on ancient architecture # #Josie Green spoke Latin and Greek # #Just forgotten girls with forgotten brains # #While history explains # #When Madame Pompadour was on a ballroom floor # # Said all the gentlemen obviously # #The Madame has the cutest # # Personality # #And think of all the books about DuBarry's looks # #What was it made her the toast of Paris # # She had a well-developed personality # #And what did Romeo see in Juliet # # Or Pierrot in Pierette # # OrJupiter in Juno # #You know # #And when Salome danced and had the boys entranced # # No doubt it must have been easy to see # #That she knew how to use her # # Personality # # So don't you say I'm smart and have the kindest heart # # Or what a wonderful sister I'd be # #Just tell me how you like my # # Personality # ## # Personality ## Well, duty calls.

She was giving me the same business. This gal's been around. Takes a lad like me to handle her. Like you? Experience is the best teacher. The best teacher? And I'm a PhD. That's Pinheaded Dope. Einstein-- Here comes the waiter with the check. Which one of you two fellas is Sperry? Experience is the best teacher, huh? Don't wait up for me. I may have to stay after school. That poor little lamb. All right, girls, everybody back! Work fast. As soon as we get the map, Ace is headin' for his place up at Dawson. You sure they're the right men? They don't look like killers. We're going to a lot of trouble on this. Don't make it tougher. I appreciate-- You wanna get your mine, don't you? Leave it to Ace. He told you to get that map. He ain't particular how you get it. Come in. Well, here I am. Start burning the incense. Come in. Well, here we are. Yes, here we are. Well? Well? Care to shoot a game of pool? I'm glad I waited, Sperry. Everything they said about you is true. I can only love a killer and you've got ''killer'' written all over you. Those shifty eyes, that weak chin-- Camouflage. How many men have you killed this week? Just 40 or 50. I've been in a pretty good mood. Let's not talk shop. It seems to me we've met somewhere before. I don't think so. Perhaps in your dreams. You wouldn't be seen in those kind of places. Some women can love any type of man, but not me. I've got to have a beast. Is a wolf considered a beast? My, what a fiery nature. Let's throw another log on it. As far as I'm concerned, this picture's over right now. Oh, Sperry! Never leave me, Sal, you'll suffer. Not for anything in the world. Not even if they offered me... a gold mine. Gold mine? Money doesn't matter to me. I don't care how poor you are. You mean that, don't you? You've got nothing to worry about. Shh! I'm loaded. Loaded? Gold mine with nuggets. Sperry, don't be facetious. Keep politics out of this. I have the biggest gold mine in Alaska. It's ours... yours and mine. What about your partner? Porky? Just a stooge. Once we get that map off of him, we're rollin'. He's got the map? Don't worry. I'll get it when he's asleep. Where does he keep it? Sorry, we don't tell anyone, we're no fools. Not even me? Not even you. I hope it's in a safe place. Who'd ever think of looking in his hat? We're not amateurs, you know. I can see that. It's getting late, you'd better run along. What's the rush? I've got another show to do. But I just got here. I said, later. Midnight, my apartment? Supper? I'm not hungry. I'll go work up an appetite. Come in. You can take the lantern out of the window, Sal gal. The mighty McGurk is home. Sit down. Make yourself cozy. I don't mind if I do. Well, this is more like it. Seems like they sent you the wrong boy. I asked for McGurk. You must've spelled it with a ''J''. I knew you'd come to your senses sooner or later. They all do. It's not hard to understand. Where're you goin'? Cigarette. You've got one. I have, haven't I? I guess I'm a little mixed up. See what you do to me? You can't help yourself, babe. You just joined the club. Must have quite a membership. Coast to coast. We can always squeeze in a new member. You're quite a panic with the ladies, aren't you? I'm murder when I make my move. Tell me, how do you do it? It's the usual routine; flowers, Sunday dinner at home with the folks, a ride in the park, sing a little song and uh-- Sing a little song. The song does it? It sort of limbers them up a little. That song may be just what we need here. Baby, you and me don't need no scales. Come on. You're not going anywhere. There's the piano. Let's hear you practice what you preach. ## #Welcome to my dream # #And how are you # #Will you be here long # # Or just passin' through # # Brush off that stardust # #Where have you been # #Don't tell me your rainbow # #Was late gettin' in # #Welcome to my dream # # It now seems real # # You're what it needed # # To make it ideal # # So glad you got here # # I hope you can stay # # But welcome to my dream # #Anyway ## What's the matter, gal? Want another chorus? Later. Later? Midnight, my apartment? What for? I'm here now. A cozy little supper? I'm not ''hongry.'' I'll go work up an appetite. Hope just said that line, didn't he? Why should he get all the laughs? Here it is. Nice work, Miss Van Hoyden. You know what to do. Keep 'em here in town. Give me 48 hours. I'll stake out the claim and bring papers. I don't know how to thank you. Forget it. We're only too happy to take care of you. You be careful. You've got a couple of bad boys there. I'll handle Mr. Sperry and Mr. McGurk. All right, mush! So you finally got yourself a date? You said it. You pick up a lonely walrus? You know I don't cut into your territory. You know that school of experience? I enrolled. Tonight I take my first exam... in cooking. Never pass. I have a date with teacher. That's fine. I like-- What do you mean? Midnight, supper, her apartment. I shall be there. Doing what, waiting on tables? That supper's for Chester. Listen, fatter-than-me, you're over-matching yourself. She made the date with me. Why would she make a date with two guys at the same time? Why not? How about that? This youth says you made a date with him. Yes, I did. You're darn right. You invited me. You sellin' tickets? I like both of you so much, and Sperry and McGurk always work together as a team. Not on everything, we don't. Let's go downstairs and talk this over. Who was it that said, ''Two's company, three's a crowd? Wasn't he silly? Yes. Yes. I see no reason why a girl can't have a good time with two fellas. As long as one's her grandfather. You don't look that old. So long, Sal. Nice knowin' you. Where you going? North to cool off. Don't you have to have a map? I got my half. I got my half. Half? I'll see you when we get back. Sled's outside. Let's get our coats and blow. Where are they? 21 8. What a blizzard! We should've put on some warm clothes. Hope there's no bear hunters around. Mine's still alive. Where do you step on the starter? No starter? Must be last year's model. It's a dog sled! We'll pull it ourselves. Not me! In a blizzard? Are you mad? We're not dogs, you know. I've got to get a sled. No dogs till tomorrow. Will you have any by daybreak? I've got to get away. Here we are, off on another road! And what a road! Case those trees, that snow, that scenery! And get a load of that bread and butter. Bread and butter? That's a mountain.! May be a mountain to you, but it's bread and butter to me. Well, keep it shady. I'm in a hurry. Think you can handle it? Handle it! I was raised up here. Mush! # I don't care where I'm going # #Just as long as I'm with you # # Put it there, pal put it there # I saw ''Let's Face It.'' And I saw ''Dixie'' too. # Put it there, pal put it there # #This country's full of wolves # # But you should make 'em laughingstocks # #The girls are fond of blubber # #And the igloos have no locks # #You'll wow the lady Eskimos They don't wear bobby socks # #You're so faithful and so fair # Hit me with your biscuit hook. Coming with some hot skin! #You've got that something in your voice so right for selling cheese # # Put it there, pal put it there # I think your jokes are great. Do you? It's just folks are hard to please. Yeah. Your hand, sir. Put that back in the bowl. #Your face could make a fortune just your nose should make a lot # # I like the way you wear # #Those gaudy-colored shirts you've got # #The only time a rainbow ever covered up a pot # #We make a perfect pair # # Put it there # My colleague. My cohort. My crony my friend. Companions. Chums to the end. Confederates. Like meat and potatoes. Or salt and tomatoes. # Boy what a blend # # Don't put it in the paper Don't put it on the air # # Don't put it on the shelf put it there # Look who's here! Santa Claus! Say, there must be a department store around here. Well, well! Chester and Duke. Whoa! Ha-ha-ha-ha. Got your Christmas presents right here. On your way, Fatso. Think we're gonna fall for that kid stuff? You mean you don't believe in Santa Claus? What do you think we are? Children? Infants? Babies? Very well. Ha-ha-ha-ha! I'll just give 'em to somebody else. You'll be sorry! Half a map! I let two-bit hoodlums cross me up. I didn't give 'em much credit. Maybe our nightingale is holding out. That's all she got. I'll get the other half-- No, you don't! I'm not going to tangle with the Mounties. Van Hoyden got half the map. Let her get the other. Suppose I go help her out? Yeah! I like that. I don't! I'm running this show. You'll both go. We'll give Kate a chance. If that doesn't work, then you take over. Whoa! Whoa! Let's go down and get them. You know what Ace said. We try Kate's way first. McKenzie's cabin's there. You understand? Give me till tomorrow morning. We'll be waiting here. And I was gonna open a Turkish bath! You had to feed that monster! And you had to bring me to Alaska! You should quit grousin'! You shoulda worn ear muffs. What for? My ears fell off an hour ago. We find that mine, you'll be a rich man. My hands are frozen, my feet, everything's frozen! You'll be sittin' on top of the world! Everything's frozen! My nose is like an icicle! Icicle? That's a glacier! Hey, look! A pedestrian! Huh! It's a dame! A dame? You kidding? What would a dame be doing up here? It could be Sonja Henie. Lemme see her. Nothing doing. I found her. Find one for yourself! Say, she ain't bad. Is she alive? Don't make no difference. She's still mine. Ha-ha, she's alive! Pick her up. She's frozen. I'd hate to be around when she thaws out. Goldilocks, let's get out of this frappe. Let me help. Okay, but don't enjoy it. No fuel shortage for us. I got my little stove. Look who's here. What are you doing here? We had a little date, remember? Nobody stands up Skagway Sal. You've got me wrong. Who'd want to? I've got my little stove now. Ahh, cabin... over there. Get her to the cabin fast. Buster, put your stove on the sled and we'll run along. What are you gonna do? We'd better start... warming things up. That's how it stands. Either we get that map off Sperry... or those butchers'll be down in the morning. That's liable to be a bit messy. Murder? I believe that's the word for it. Woop! Woop! Ha-ha-ha! This is jolly,jolly. Snug-warm cabins, congenial companions. Yes, sir! Doing grand, grand, grand. I'd consider Sal showing up quite a coincidence... if I didn't know how crazy she was about me. Can't keep her eyes off me. How come she's always looking at me? She wants to see what a bargain she's getting. I didn't notice her getting the welcome mat out for you. I'm already in the kitchen with my shoes off. Ooo, ooo! Yes, sir, this is great. I think my worm has B.O. It couldn't be you. We'll get another. I will admit there's something phony about that dame. She just don't seem to belong here in Alaska. Are you kidding? That shows how much you know about women. Could you see that girl anywhere but Alaska? Nah, I guess not. See what I mean? You don't know any more about women than you do about fishing! No? You see what the score is, don't you? Duke, 1 3. Chester, 0. You're skunked, ol' boy. You're using loaded bait. When it comes to fishing, you can't tell how good a guy is... until you know what he's fishing for. Hi, boys. Here's my filet. Warm it, honey, right here. McGurk, I'd like to be alone with Sperry. Run over to Peoria and get me a ham sandwich and check with me in about three years. We may need you as a bridesmaid. Wait. Number 1 4 just checked in. Well, if you're a good boy, I'll save you a few heads. Pick one out for yourself. That guy burns me up, him and his 1 4 fish. You'd think there was no romance left. Think all a fella had to do was catch one crummy fish! Let's go for a walk in the woods. Just a minute. I got more nibbles than I can handle. Hey, bud, where's your partner? He just stepped into-- huh? Just tell him 15 was here. Come on! Okay. Come on! Come on, folks. Quit following us, will ya? It's funny, us going for each other this way. I guess it just had to be. We couldn't help it. We were thrown together by fate. You weren't thrown together. That took planning. Oh, what a project! Let's sit down. The minute I heard you sing, it hit me in the old ticker. It was going... pitter-patter. Then... patter-pitter! How's it going now? I can't tell pitter from patter. #You wouldn't dare be too bold # #Would you # #And think that my hand was to hold # #Would you # #And you wouldn't play # # On my sympathy # #Then take advantage of me # #Would you # #You shouldn't be quite so near # # Should you # # Or whisper those words in my ear # # Should you # #You can't get romantic # #That you know takes two # # But darling # # If I would # #Would you ## Ha-ha! Hot snow. Don't get anxious. Didn't anyone ever tell you there'd be moments like this? My school teacher... just before we were expelled. Sperry, how long must we wait? Huh? McGurk's map. Suppose he runs off with it? I've got the other half! I hope it's in a safe place. Don't worry. We're not amateurs. Where's the map? There's only one map I want to talk about. Yours... that skin, those lips. Where is it? Those eyes, they're beautiful-- and they match! Are you going to tell me? Let's get back to pitter-patter. Come on! Dinner's ready. Who can eat? Dinner. Whoa! Look at those tracks. We must be on the right trail. Come on! I never thought a woman'd get me to washing dishes, drying 'em and liking it. But I'm washing 'em and I'm drying 'em... and I'm liking it! We'll need some water for tomorrow's coffee. Do you mind? I might as well get used to it. I think I'll get a little fresh air. Why'd you get rid of Chowderhead? The map. He wants to steal your half and run away with me. Who are you kidding? What map? He told you where I had it, huh? Fine pal. That's friendship for you. A man has to sink low when he'll sell out his best friend. You wouldn't say where his map is, would you? You're darn right I wouldn't. It can stay in his undershirt until it rots! It shouldn't take long either. I trusted him. When do we leave? Huh? Can we get it tonight? You've been blowing hot and cold all through this deal. How come all of a sudden I'm your boy? I'm particular... what type man I share a gold mine with. That the type? It'll do. Just some of my lighter stuff. Promise me something. Go back to Frisco and give yourself up. What? We'll fight together. Maybe they won't hang you. I got a little T.L. for you. I'm not McGurk. It was all an act. We found the map on the boat. My name's DukeJohnson. I knew I couldn't love a murderer. That Sperry, he's the killer. Oh, a despicable character! Those weak eyes, that shifty chin. Of course. Definite criminal type. We'll take care of him and his map. It isn't his map, it's mine. It was my father's. Now it's yours and mine. The mine, understand? I think the trip was a little too much for you. I'll get the map tomorrow. There's no time. They'll kill you. Larson and those butchers are up in the hills. Get some shut-eye. It'll fix you up. I think this gal is cracking up. put her to bed to get rest. I'll go case the killer. But, Duke! Hey, what's going on? He's not McGurk and I'm not going through with it. I'm in love with him. You fool! Those thugs are in the hills. If you love him, you've got to go through with it. He's not McGurk. They can't kill him. The only way you can save him is to get to Ace Larson. You'll never get out of here without that map. Well? What do you say? We'll get it tonight when they're asleep. #Welcome to my dream # #And how are you # #Will you be here long # # Or just passing through # # Brush off that stardust # #Where have you been # # Don't tell me your rainbow # #Was late gettin' in # #Welcome to my dream # # It now seems real # #You're what it needed # #To make it ideal # Did you lose something? Is that you, honey? Don't say a word. I'll do the talking. You're puffing. You didn't have to run here. Things are gonna be different after we're married. I'm gonna do big things for you. I'm gonna buy you real furs. You won't have to wear this cheap imitation. I'm gonna buy you a home. No more sleeping on cold floors. - Gesundheit, dear. And the jewels I'm gonna buy! Emerald bracelets down to there. And diamond rings for your fingers too. They'll go so well with those long nails of yours. Honey, you've been working too hard! - Sperry, are you awake? - Of course, I'm awake. - Who's that with you? - Who do you think? It's you. Grr. It's... a bear. Keep calm, just keep calm. Help! Who's your girlfriend, Junior? It's a bear. Do something! Who do you think I am, Daniel Boone? Looks like we've got another mouth to feed. Looks like I'm on the menu. Get my arm out of here. She likes affection maybe. Keep it up or we'll both be bear bait. We'll be so happy together. I can see us romping around Yellowstone Park. - We'll live with your folks. - Grrr! All right, with my folks! We'll raise a family, a boy for you, a bear for me. Help! We're cooked. Here's the house detective. A fine thing! A fish they let talk. Me... they won't give one stinking line! Whoa! Whoa! I hope he'll understand. Quit worrying. Come on, Lebec. Let's go. Mush! Come on! Cut it out. Fix our breakfast, Dollface. We'll see you later. Ahh. Come on, girls. Hi, fellas. Where's that map? The map? Oh-- Oh, the map! Yeah, the map. Don't worry. We got it. Yeah, we got it. It's in his cap and in my-- Let me see that cap.! Okay, this is it. Wait. We'll get the map for you. Sure. Where is it? Well, it's in-- It's in the bear's mouth. Get it and be quick. Smart guys, us. We're a couple of pigeons. A dame hits us twice with those big moose eyes... and we start giving away gold mines. If we get that map back, I'm brushing dames off forever. They're poison. They run their fingers through your hair, then throw you in the gutter. You know what's worse? What? I love it. Next time, we shoot first. And ask questions afterwards. Those guys are green. They won't get far. They took our dogs! Those ain't the only dogs in Alaska! We'll find some. A couple of prospectors. Yeah. Reach! Mush! They got a good start. We'll catch 'em. Did you ever think of those dog teams? The lead dog is the only dog that gets a change of scenery. Care for another pillow? No, I'm fairly comfortable. Yes. Mind the bumps like a good fella, eh? Whoa! There they are. Who's that? Moose hunting. Mush, mush! Mush. I'm dying and you want to eat. Go ahead. Come on, boy! Boy! Why didn't I think of this before? Exciting, isn't it? If Hope and Crosby are caught, they'll be killed. They won't be able to tell any more of those jokes. Come on, mush, mush! Whoa! What is this? Alcatraz? Let's hit for the rocks. It's our only chance. Hey, they'll find us. It's either us or them. My money's on them. I'll take this rope. We may need it. Nice place to throw the Grand Canyon. All this ice and no ginger ale. Stay up. You'll get a draw. You all right? We gotta get out somewhere, either up or down. It ain't down. Let's go down the middle. Okay. Oh-oh, dead end. A one-way mountain. What'll we do now? We'll use the rope. There must be some reason for it. It might catch on a tree, huh? They gotta be here somewhere. Here goes. One in a million. Throw a nail up too. Oh, hey! Help! We made it! Made it? Boy, one in a million. One in a million! It's solid, let's go. Woop! Hold on! Oh, boy. Say, you got a match? Yeah. Ohhh! What's the matter? You crazy? Match. Rub your head against the rocks. All out. Top floor. Going down. I'm slipping. Untie your boot. You touch that boot and I'll cut your hand off! Boy, that'll hold 'em. We could've been killed! Hey, am I dead? I can't tell. You always look that way. Come on! Shh! Shh. Shh! Shh! One little sound starts a whole avalanche. I should have worn my derby. You want them to hear us? Hiccup the other way. That's the only way I know how. Suppress it somehow. Frighten me. I can't. I haven't got a mirror. Sing something. Huh? It's cracking up. One little sound starts an avalanche. Don't worry. I'm okay now. Concentrate. Count to 20. I can't. I've got my mittens on. Count! Five, ten, fifteen-- What now? I think one more will do it. Let's see you come up with something now. Ready, aim, fire. I can't. I'm out of gas. Think of something, somebody. W.C. Fields. Who? Now for Dawson City and those dames! Dames! We'll be lucky if we get to Dawson City. Just a minute. I'm the navigator. What? Again? They're not Sperry and McGurk. It's all a mistake. Mistakes happen, but that can be remedied. I'll send a couple boys back to the cabin... and they can explain things to Sperry and McGurk. They're not Sperry and McGurk! Well, whoever they are. You wait here. I don't want any slipup. How do we spot 'em? Wherever they go, they travel with a big shaggy dog. Drink up. Keep your eyes open. They may be on their way here now. Mush, mush! Whoa, you dogs. Okay, gas up, kids. Very tiring trip. I should've had you at the other end of the sled. Come on, Curly. Where you going with that fleabag? We got trouble enough. Stake her out there. Don't want her? Put her over here. Wait for us, Fuzz. If you see anything in slacks, bark twice and I'll join you. Don't forget, be fair. We act tough. Mosey over to the bar and ask a few questions. Why, ''shore.'' Couple of strangers in town. Hello, boys. You new in town? Yeah. Yeah. Join me in a drink? Don't mind if we do. What'll you have? Oh, a couple fingers of rotgut. What's yours? I'll take a lemonade... in a dirty glass! What's all the celebration? A posse. There's going to be a little hanging. Little hanging, huh? Well, what do you know. Hanging, huh? Well, that's ''noose'' to me. That's noose-- I made a joke. We're killing 'em here. Or vice versa. Hangin', huh? Sounds gay. Sure does. Happy hunting, partner. Who are you stringing up? Couple of fellas who call themselves Sperry and McGurk. You don't happen to know them, do you? I know Sperry when I see McGurk. I mean, I know McGurk when-- Never heard of'em. Join us? We'd love to, but it's getting late. Got a little ironing to do. Hey, you! It's going to be a lovely hanging, boys. I have an idea you ought to be there. Look, stranger, how you gonna hang these fellows? You don't know 'em. How 'bout that? We'll know 'em when we see 'em. They always travel with a big shaggy dog. Well, I-- I-yi-yi-yi. I-yi-yi-yi. A big shaggy dog, huh? Yeah! The minute we see that dog, we're gonna string them up. The minute you see the dog-- Gonna string them up, eh? Sounds like a cinch. All you gotta do is find a big shaggy dog. Alaska's full of them big shaggy fellas. A dime a dozen around here. All you have to do... is find a big shaggy dog? What's the matter with him? His foot's gone to sleep. Stomp on it a bit. - Woof! - Woof! Woof! Woof! He thinks he's a dog. His mother was frightened by a Pekingese. Woof. Woof, woof. That's all right, Rover. Gimme your paw, Rover. Gimme your paw. That's a good dog. Okay, I'm over it. You don't think you're a dog? I'm not a dog. You feel all right? Feel how cold my nose is. Oh, what a hot horn! This is a sick dog, sick boy. He doesn't look sick. Let me hear that bark. - Woof! - Woof! Quite a big echo. Come on, Fido. Woof, woof! Oh, he's gone again. He's gone. Downhill... the whole place slants. Whoa, boy. Woof! Woof! Woof! A little congested. We'll use the family entrance. Woof, woof, woof! It's been fun! Let's get 'em! Come on, boys! Hey! Sal. Why... the little crook. That's the story, Mr. Lebec. Kate can tell you. The only reason I went through with it was to save their lives. I'm in love with one of them. I'd die before I'd let anything happen to him. Very noble of you. Imagine a girl loving a guy that much. Yeah. I'm not worth it. I'm a regular Casablanca. Casanova! When did they change that? Mr. Larson will understand. They're here! Put the map in the safe. What about her? Tie her up. I'll take care of her later. Why the dirty-- I told you they wouldn't let you say that. We gotta save her! We'll get that map first. It's hers! Suppose they knock her off? They'll be looking for us. We'll get the map and the girl. What a parley! Now you're talking. Come on, push, push! Hey, get out. Go chase a tree. Get rid of him. Throw something. A stick or something. Get me some brandy. A stick, yeah. Sic! Go! That way. What do you hear? Shh! Who taught you that racket? My old man. Oh, following in your father's fingerprints, huh? He was great. Need a little light. I'll light the lantern. No, you crazy? They'll see us. There's a box of candles. It's a funny-looking candle. Why has it got such a big wick? The nights up here are six months long. Oh. And me with insomnia. There's something wrong with this thing. Blow on it a little. Bring it down here. Let me see. Duke, I'm kinda glad you talked me into this deal. You said it was Utopia and you were right. It's been a lot of work and I've beefed a lot but I'll never blow up again. Come to Papa. There you are, you pleasant little parchment. That's great! It's only sensational. Sensational? It's dynamite! It's dynamite! Take it, it's dynamite. Dynamite? Well, finders keepers! I couldn't stand the noise. Wait for me. Throw it out the window. Out the window! Back away. Don't crowd, you dog. Take five. You had to bring that dog! This is no time to go shooting off your mouth. He's going to do it for us. Oh, what a fur coat he's going to make. Locked? Let's spread out before the joint does. They must be here. Get out and find them. Maybe we could sneak through. That's a slaughter house. You wanna hang upside down? What size hook do you want? Look.! Dynamite, see? The real thing, see? I'll give you three to get out of here. One, two-- Nice going. Douse it! Put it out! Ooo, got a hot knuckle. Attaboy. Thought they could scare me, huh? You got plenty of heart. It's just close in here. What round was it? Let's find Sal and get out. In here.! Right rudder. Don't worry, baby. We're here now. We showed 'em! We're not amateurs. No, sir! Get you outta here in no time. We'll get you outta here. Don't worry. I smell something burning. The dynamite! Put that out! Ooo! It's me! Here! Come on. It's dynamite going off in there! Where's that map? Okay, you win. Start talking! It's in there in the desk. Third drawer from the right. Want us to get it? No more of your tricks. This time, we'll get it ourselves! We'll hear from them later. They'll be men about town. Let's go. Well, that's it. The map, the mine, the three million dollars. Not quite. Mush! Come on! Look! No hands! Watch out, no teeth. Please... my sponsor. This way, come on! Wait. That's north. There isn't any north. I suppose it went south for the winter! You're near the North Pole. What about it? There's no north, south, east or west. You're crazy! East is east and west is west and never the twain shall meet. There's no direction at the North Pole. An eight-year-old knows that. Next time come here with an eight-year-old child. You'll do! - Are you getting shorter? - Me? How 'bout you? Oh, I thought it was getting drafty. Aaah! Look out.! They're coming behind you. Come on,jump.! I can't make it. Here's the map. I'll hold 'em off as long as I can. Take care of Sal. She's yours now. So long, Sal. So long, Duke. Boy, what a pal. Anything I can do for you? Any last requests? Look up my mother. - Anything else? - Uh, give her my watch. Anything else? Tell her to give you a hot foot. What happened, Duke? How did you get away? Simple enough. There were only 1 5 of them. I picked them up one by one, knocked 'em out and tossed 'em in the chasm. Naturally. Sal, how have you been? How's he been treating you? No complaints, Duke. Chester has been a devoted husband and a fine father. Father? You have children? One, a boy. Would you like to see him? Junior? Did you call me, Mom? We adopted him.
