In exhibition football... Oh, man. Only a sublet. Only a sublet. Fuck. "Rare village charmer. "Wood-burning 'firpoke'... fireplace. " It's probably a dump. If it's not a dump, it's probably gone. If it's not gone, there's a catch. Yhere's always a catch. # Oh, I used to ask my mother # # Would i ever find true love? # # She would tell me # True love # Mm-hmm # Oh, yeah # Is hard to find # Mm-hmm # So I've traveled on # Everyone I came upon # I would stop and ask, they would tell me # # "True love # is hard to find" # That's what they would say # So years have passed # And I'm all alone, no longer do I # You mind watching this for me? # I just place my faith # In five little words # From way back in my past # My mama said # "Seek and you shall find" # That's what mama said # "Seek and you shall find" # 'Cause I know if I keep trying # # I can... # 'Cause there's no denying # "Seek and you shall find" # I know that's what my mama said # # "Seek and you shall find" # Lord # "Seek and you shall find" Hello? # If it's love that you're looking for # # "Seek and you shall find" I'll take it. # It might be right around the corner # # Seek You must be Mr. Lester. It's perfect. Sam. Hi, Sam. Um, you know, Sam... As I mentioned to you on the phone, it's a very unusual situation. Well, it's... It's just what I'm looking for. Mr. McVeigh is getting married, but he'd like to keep this place and the furniture. Tell me... is the current tenant... Oh, it's Brian McVeigh. Is Brian color-blind? Excuse me, madam. No, it's okay. It's my sister over here. Hi, sweetheart. Hello. Your hair's lighter. Oh, shut up. You look great. Nice outfit. Oh, this? Matinee day. Oh, my God. You saw a play. I am shocked. No. No, I went shopping. Oh. Bendel's is empty on matinee day. Of course. How was work? What could be new? I came, I flossed, I polished. Okay. So, what's the big news? You're not pregnant. Lucy, I'm a married woman. You're not having an affair. Get real. Okay, you give up? You give up. All right. "Rare village charmer"... It's only two days a week, but it could be like my own what-do-you-call-it in the city. Pied- -terre. Yeah, whatever. But... on tuesdays, I... I... I could go to museums. And... and on thursdays... for shopping. I could paint. But... I could take an art class, you know? Mr. McVeigh would like to offer you this place two days a week for $92 a month. Sold. You mean you don't care that it's just two days a week? Well, no. actually, it's all I can afford right now. Oh. No, no, no. What I mean is... I mean right now. I'm already renting a place... with roommates... lots and lots of roommates. Oh, well, then I'm sure you'll enjoy some privacy two nights a week. Right. Okay, now... Brian keeps wednesdays and fridays. Tuesday nights and thursday nights have already been claimed. So that leaves... Well, so I'll take monday and, um... Saturday, in case I, uh, want to go on a... Well, not exactly a date, but in case I... In case you get lucky? Brian, it's rented. Mrs. Winkler... I could kiss you. I love this woman. Okay, everybody, I got an announcement. I know there's been a lot of rumors going around that, uh, because of, uh... because I'm... Because she owns you. Because of my betrothal, I was going to give up... pleasure. The lion's den. No. No. No. Where there's a rent-controlled lease, there's always a way. So... what's the deal? Well, two days a week... T.G.I.F. and wednesday-night poker. Aah! Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, yeah! Ah! Who commerced? A - a stewardess? I don't even know them. I had, uh, my secretary set up an unequal three-way time-sharing progression. Wiggy. Wiggy-wiggy. Yeah, right. One's gonna paint... and Mrs. Winkler says the other one is getting over a - a broken heart. Two years of my life. What a waste. I wonder how she's doing. Oh, a mirror... That's a little self-absorbed. It's a reflection on our narcissistic culture. Yeah. Sam, maybe you shouldn't have come tonight. I'm fine. Adeeka, adeeka, adeeka, adeeka. La-di-da, la-di-da, la-di-da, da-di-da. My mother, my sister, my mother, my sister. What is she doing? Aaah! Oh! No! Oh! Jesus Christ. What is she doing? It's... it's an expression of her frustration with the weight of European history. Ah. Shh! Ahh. Ahh. Oh... Who's the little lobster? Would you like some lobster? Uncle Sam. Would you dance with me, please? Sam. What's that supposed to mean? It's a symbol, Sam. Boys... Aaah! I thought it went over very well. Bertrand missed his, uh, lightning cues, the fool. R - really? I thought so. But I don't think anybody there noticed. What does you know about art? You know, pastel, I worry about you walking home alone... Sam! In the neighborhood. I don't use a lecture now. All right. Oh, Sammy. The old apartment. Put the bag there. Ahh. Hmm. You put some new posters of yourself up. I didn't want, uh, memories of us, uh, haunting me now that the place is mine now, hmm? Hmm? Hey, um... You want me to... run downstairs and pick up some food and... whip something up? No. When you cook for me, I fall in love again. I cannot do this now, hmm? Mm. I have an appointment early in the morning for the PBS TV. I show them tonight's tape. Omelette? Sam, mnh-mnh. Someday when you're a big restaurateur and I am a star, maybe for us it will work. But now... you must go. Don't make it any harder for us. Well... Guess I'll be going. Could you put out my cigarette? Sure. Ciao, Sammy. # Rockaby, baby, on the treetop # Aah! # When the wind blows, the cradle will rock # Come on, baby. # When the bough breaks, the cradle will fall # Ooh! # And down will come baby, cradle and all # Yeah! Ooh! Yeah! Ooh! ooh! ooh! Ooooh! Oh! Ooh, yeah. It's wake-up time, Brian. Brian? This is 96.3... Good morning. Nozart in the morning. I was having the best dream about us. So was I. Oh, I dreamt that we were old, Brian... and that we'd been married for 50 years. And all our grandchildren and our great-grandchildren were all gathered at Mommy's in Nantucket for our anniversary. What was your dream about? Mine? Uh... like that. Same kind. Mr. Jonathan is coming over wednesday after work, and he's gonna show us some fabrics. We don't have to decide right away. That's what we pay him for. Wednesday? I thought I was gonna see the guys. Well, you'll have to change it, darling. No problem. Oh, besides, we have the ballet wednesday nights. Oh, yeah, ballet. I keep forgetting that. Thank you. Good morning, Mrs. Beehan. Mr. Beehan. What? No. No, I'm Beehan, he's McVeigh, but just for a few more months. Ah, fuck. Excuse me. Rinse, Mr. Potesky. I said, "Rinse," not gargle, Mr. Potesky. Rinse. Hmm. Yeah. Yeah. You may spit. Would you adjust my headrest again on the left side here, 'cause... Do you like my shirt? It's very nice. I just got it in London. Would you... have... Would you like to go to London sometime? I'm a married woman, Mr. Potesky. Happily? Dr. John. Dr. John... she won't go to London with me, Doc. Have a lolly. He's all yours. Thanks. Can I ask you something? When she works on me with those rubber gloves, that's just a standard practice now, isn't it? It's not... Open. Ahh. I know, I know... I'm late. It's okay. There was a tie-up on the belt parkway you wouldn't believe. Oh, Aaron, it's not like the tuna's gonna get cold. All right, the truth... I was at Marty's watching the islanders, overtime. Look, I was with... Pass the ketchup. Oh, thanks. Yeah. Anyway, uh... I was with Lucy, and she wanted... That's good-looking tuna. I lied. There was no overtime. No one's making a federal case out of it. I've got a surprise. We're moving. What? To where? To our new ranch-style modern colonial with wrap deck and hallway atrium. What? You're joking. No. I just went out and did it. Marty talked me into it. Exit 52 on the L.I.E. Sparrow's nest development. Oh. I got it. Secret garret... rediscovers a horizon of color... and form. And I'll take half a pound of French Chevret. Want to try domestic? What's the difference? About $4 a pound. Otherwise, the French is a little more status. The domestic is... it's fresher. It's milkier. We have some very good... I'll take the French. French. Thank you. Heathens. Sam, pick up line 2. Line 2, Sam. Excuse me. Excuse me. Got to buy French cheese. Got to buy French cheese. Hello? Good morning. This is Mrs. Winkler calling for Brian McVeigh... Uh, who's had an unavoidable change of scheduling and was wondering if you wouldn't mind switching your monday night for his wednesday. Just wednesday? Mm-hmm. Uh, sure. Wednesday is fine. Oh, good. Then it's settled. Now, it'll be Brian on monday and Sam wednesday. Oh, should I send you another chart? No. don't be silly, Mrs. Winkler. Bye. Oh, yes! Yes! Excuse me. Uh, excuse me. half a pound of St. Andr triple crme, please. Triple crme. Triple crme. That is heart-attack cheese. just take a knife to your heart and stab it. It's, uh... a little over. Stupid French. Sam. Smoke cigarettes. Come on, Sam. Eat fat cheese. It doesn't hurt them. Nothing hurts them. But no charge. Sam, this isn't about cheese. It's not about cheese, It's too bad? Faux pas. Pity, sadness. What are you... Camus? Is Pastel seeing someone, Sam? No. Yes. Maybe. I don't know. I'm sorry. Big deal. What's the difference? Why? What makes you think that she is? Well, an artist needs... Needs to experience things. What does that mean? I suppose that I'm sexually paranoid? No, it's too late. You're way past that. You're on the verge of the psychotic. What's her problem, then? No matter what I want from her, she can't give it to me. What is her problem that no matter what I want from her, she can't give it to me. What is her problem that no matter what I want from her... Sam, instead of asking maybe it would be better to ask, "What is my problem... that I am trying to get something from someone who can't give it to me?" What's your point? My point is... I've got a girl I want you to meet, to date. Oh, no. No, I can't. I couldn't. You can, Sam. You should. It's Catha. Come in. I know. I know I have been in this building before. It is the weirdest thing, but I know. I know. yes. Yes. Yes. Well, maybe you were. I'm Sam. But I wasn't, don't you see? I wasn't... Not in this life. But there's an aura I... I know. I know, kooky, right? No, no. N - not at all. My chiropractor, Tom... he's wonderful. He's just amazing. And he says that maybe it's my alignment. Is that veal? Not just any veal. I don't eat veal. I... I don't eat meat, but I especially do not eat veal. Do you know how they treat veal when it's young? Well, actually, veal isn't an animal. They pen it up. Lillian says that it's... Who's Lillian? Lillian, my nutritionalist, she says that it's antibiotics and steroids... All right, well, we don't have to eat it. All right. I could make an omelette. Eggs, uh, don't combine at all. No, they don't, do they? I combine now. Besides, I'm... I'm lacto-ovo. Well, so was my sister, except for Chinese food. Right. Okay. Uh... Kenneth tells me that you two went to art school together. Oh, yes. Um, a lifetime ago. Wine? No. Alcohol... Doesn't combine, does it? It... it breeds yeast. "Dear Thursday... "You can savor my veal stew... or you can turn this page. " Okay. "I'll spare you the humiliating details, "but last night's date was a wash, "which means if you don't eat my leftovers, "they will spoil... "Which brings me back to last night's date. Enough said. " Yeah. "Hope you enjoy it. Leave me the dishes. Yours in rent control, wednesday. " Hmm. Yeah! Football... the Giants dropped a... # Her name came up today # To my surprise # My eyes watered up # But I didn't cry # I pictured our good times # And I almost had a laugh # I'm finally bouncin' back # I'm finally bouncin' back, yeah # # Fall and winter's gone # I've made it through the cold # # Shivered through some storms, man, all night all alone # # I didn't like that # I can see that silver lining # # I see it now at last # I'm finally bouncin' back # I'm finally bouncin' back # I'm finally bouncin' back You sure... you sure you don't want some wine? No. No, really. Okay. #...

Ellen. P.S., food's great. " Let me see that note. Nah. Official. What? Who's it from? The painter chick, the one who comes on thursday. You doing her, huh? Wiggy, wiggy, wiggy. You giving her the big dart, huh? Hey, come back here. Wiggy! She just left a note saying how much she likes the place. Obviously, she's got good taste. Obviously. Hey, guys, check this out. The new remote control. Ooh! Chuck Barber here in the studio. While we were away, the umpires have convened on the field and are meeting to discuss... well, let's just take a look down there and see what's going on. It turns out the umpires have decided to call out the grounds crew here. Uh, the, uh, storm that is brewing... it shouldn't be with us too long, I can't believe this. But, hey, no sense in taking chances. Where's it raining? You know, driving over here... Huh? Tell me! Where the fuck is it raining?! Shit... the pizza. Oh, God. Oh, great. Hey, pizza's on fire. hey, i screwed up. Would you put it out? There's a cappuccino place... He is such a jerk. Look at this. I sewed these by hand. Then you deserve what you get. Oh, God. These are good. So what if he used your curtains to drain them? No. That's the... This is the other guy. This is t-the bad man. Those are from the good man. Mmm. You really should meet him one of these days. Oh, that's it. God damn it. Has he no shame? No. Come on, just try. I don't have to do anything or be anything. Come on. I don't have to do anything or be anything. Okay? Good. And... I can love myself just because i'm me. Sam, girl on line one. American accent. Hello? Where the hell do you get off? I'm sorry, who's this? I'm ellen. I'm not your mother. I'm not your wife. I'm not supposed to clean up after you, and what you did to my basil plants is completely unforgivable. Oh, wait a minute. You're Ellen from the apartment? Duh. Uh, you didn't like what I did to the plant? I thought that you'd be happy. Happy? You thought I'd be happy? This is unbelievable. You thought I'd be happy? You know what? You're out of your fucking macho mind! Mnh-mnh-mnh. Tsk, tsk, tsk. Next. Mrs. Winkler... could you send some flowers to my tuesday and thursday woman at the lion's den? She, uh, sent me a nice note. "Mi casa es su casa. Fondly, Brian. " Ellen, hi. I bought you a little gift. Mr. Potesky, I thought you just had x-rays. Huh? Oh, no, but I moved last time. Maybe you should hold me down. Hold you down? Ellen, it's Aaron. He's getting out of work early tonight. Hi. I can't... I can't talk. I have Mr. Potesky in the chair. Tonight? Oh, Christ. I don't even know what she's doing. Isn't she supposed to be dead? Game's starting. Aaron, it's just two more minutes. Chuck Barber back with you in the NCK Studios. If you're an islander fan, you'll want to... Ellen, we're gonna miss the 10:40. Who cares? Relax. A foreign movie. I don't read enough during the I have a surprise for you. Just hold on one second. What is it? Okay, wait. Shh. Close your eyes. Why? Because I have a surprise for you. Oh, oh, come on, this is so stupid. Come on. No, it's not. Come on. Give me your hand. Ellen, what are you doing? I'm adding romance to our life. We're married. We're gonna have a nice, little romantic evening in this place. Stay right there. Okay. Music. Oh. Back. What is this? This is, um, you know Karen, the receptionist at work... she gave it to us for the evening. It's like our own little romantic pied- -terre in the city. Ellen? Yeah? Ellen. Ellen. Ellen. Ellen. This is a slum. I... I... it reminds me of my grandmother's. There's no carpet. It's old. I... Oh, look at these. Look at these paintings. I imagine what she paid for this place. So it's a rental, right? She could probably own something in flushing for less. #... To dry my tears # So what do I do with the thought of you? # # To forget you is my greatest fear # # I'd lose my... Oh, shit. It's the fun cops. Come on, I got to go to work. I'm sorry, dude. You know how it is. Oh, shit. Oh, shit. P - Pastel, what are you doing here? Oh, Sam. What is it you're doing here? Oh. Bark, bark, woof! How can you eat that stuff? Sam, don't start. Fine. Hey, Pastel, bonjour. You believe this? No, I didn't know Shep was crashed with Sam. Who... who's Shep? Hey, dude. I'm a friend of Leslie's. I got here last night. Morning. Last night? You met him last night, and already you're sleeping with him? So what? Get on my back already. I'm not your little girl waiting to be rescued. Where did you guys meet? Mm, well, a meat market. Oh, Sam. I am sorry you cannot deal with rejection. Oh, I'm being rejected. I'm being rejected. That's a good one. Mm-hmm. I'm not being rejected. I'm... I'm disappointed in you. Who's being rejected? Sam. Good morning, Leslie. Hey, Shep. Hi, Les. Go ahead. Play water sports with Tex here. That ought to liberate you artistically. You're very hard on her. Oh, you see? Oh, you see. Oh, everyone sees. You want me to be something you want, not what I want! What you say you want to do, not what you do do! No, I do do what I say I do! What I don't do is what you say I do! I want to do. I don't understand that. Um, uh, uh, more coffee? I... no, I can't deal with this now. I can't deal with this now. Uh, I have a rehearsal at PBS for my video. Not that you care even still. Why should I care about that? Oh, that's nice. Typical male ego. No, you leave Sam alone! Oh, ho ho. Well, Sam... Will you tape it for me tonight on your VCR? Huh? Please? Sammy. Hmm? Excuse me. Do you have any really poor-quality, low-grade videotape? That's it. Now I know it's over. That was a tough morning, Sam. No, no, the music. You know you're really breaking up when every last song you hear, no matter how stupid, suddenly sounds incredibly poignant. #... And I'm with you This is the saddest song. # And all that I so want to give you, babe # Thank you very much. Yep. Have a nice day. She had no way of knowing you were living there, too. That's the thing. It's almost like... like I was meant to see her, so it would finally sink in. $4.50. no bag. Save a tree. I mean, it can't be an accident that the guy she picked up just got into New York and happens to be crashing at the place that I happen to be subletting. You know? Hello? Don't you think? I mean, there's got to be a reason for it, right? Sam, there is no reason for anything. Thank you. Thank you. Remind me never to invite you to a funeral. Whatever happens, happens, Sam. That's all I'm saying. Pez? Sure. Uh, nah. Yeah. Ah. I can't make up my mind. But you need to have a little fun in your life. Whatever happened to Catha? We didn't combine well. Well, why don't you ask Leslie out? Oh, come on. No, I... I'm not ready for a relationship right now. I can't handle it. Well... Can't even handle a plant. On the bright side, no sex is safe sex. Yeah. You know what I'd like? You want to know what I'd like right now? I'd like to meet a girl from Norway... who speaks no English at all and is only in this country for two weeks 'cause she's gonna be flying to Malaysia or Burma and gonna stay there for about five years. That I can handle. Pardon me. Do you know if I am Greenwich Village? There it is. Over there. Oh, I'm sorry. It's over there. It's over there. Right here... Will be a two-story atrium. So when you walk in past the landscaped lawn area, you'll get a feeling of vastness... Of openness, if you will. A chandelier above... will light the way toward... the colonial-style living room... with mock fieldstone fireplace. Now, the bedrooms... Uh, you ordered, uh... Four. Two boys and a girl. Aaron means well, you know, but it's just like the whole day I felt like I was in another time zone. Yeah, like 20 years. Do you want to stay here for a while? You're welcome to. I keep trying to tell him, but it's like he just doesn't want to listen. Well, you've got to do something. You can't move out there. I'm thinking of having an affair. You're kidding. You mean you're not upset? Just let me know if you want me to lie or to cover or to stall... anything. It's gonna be weird, though... sleeping with another man. God. Can you imagine? Promise to tell me what it's like. It's been so long. Yeah, like 29 years. Well, ellen, you're 29. Yeah. So it can't have been 29 years. It can't? Not unless... No. Don't tell me. What? Oh, my God. What?! I'm sorry. It's just... How can that be? I don't know. Talk to me. Do you sell caviar? I'm cheese. Caviar's down there. They told me that you... you would know. I'm kind of an institution around here. Um, all right, what's the occasion? Uh, well, one... it's a special night with a special person. And two... I have champagne. And, uh, three... what goes with it? Four... anything but tuna. Oh. Excuse me. All right, so much for jokes. No, it was funny. It was just... Uh, how well does this special person know his caviar? Um, I'm not sure. Well, how well do you know this special person? Well, we... we, uh, live together. Excuse me. I'm double-parked. I have some, uh, overpriced beluga. Oh, it's marvelous. I had it last weekend. And I have some California. It's trendy, but so-so. Or we just got a new shipment in from China. I've tasted it, and it's fine, really fine. Only thing is, nobody believes that they make caviar in China, so it's about half the price. Mm. It's a really special evening. I know. You'll take the overpriced beluga. No. Um... just give me enough for two people, and I think he eats a lot. She trusts me. She trusts me. I'll take the overpriced beluga. T.G.I.F.! Wiggy. Okay. Let the game begin. What? Buddha's not coming? He watched the game already. Great. We all agree not to watch it, and he watches the game. Ow! Why do you think these people invented the VCR? Hey. What the fuck? What... I don't believe this shit. Well, you must have set it wrong... the timer. Right. Me... set a VCR timer wrong? Well, Brian, does she look like a linebacker to you? Oh, shit.

The one time in my life I cheat, and I screw it up, and I sleep with the wrong guy. And you... How could you?! It's... you know, one last fling. A condemned man is entitled to one last hearty breakfast. Oh, shut up! What? What did I say? I mean, how could you sleep with me?! Yeah, but that's because I thought you were someone else. Boy... Way to make a guy feel wanted. I mean, you don't even know me. Well, at least I know who you were. You're the babe who cooks all that great food. No, that is Sam, you idiot! You're the one with the ugly furniture! No, baby, You got it all wrong. This is my furniture. His is the ugly stuff. Oh, my God. What? What? What? Aaron. Chicks. Yeah? Can... can you take me to Elmhurst? No, no, I don't know where it is. It's in queens. No, no, madam, that's very far. Please. Come on, no... please. I need to go to Queens. Uh, but... Come on, lady. Ple... Hello? Hello? Please don't cry. I... I said I'll take you to Queens. I need to go to Queens. We'll go to Queens. Here. Here. See? We go to Queens. I slept with the wrong guy. Don't be so hard on him, lady. Give him a chance. How could I be so stupid to sleep with the wrong guy?! Oh, don't worry. You'll find the right guy. You'll find a better guy. I have a better guy! Then what's the problem? Well, what am I gonna tell my husband? Oh. Don't tell him. Don't tell him anything. If he doesn't know, he'll take you back. But I don't want him to take me back. But then what do you want? I want Sam! Now, who is Sam? I don't know! Oh! Oh, there's something... and what do you... Madam, this is a taxi, madam, not a bedroom. I got to get... Oh. Calm down. Calm... Here. Here, blow your... I didn't mean to do it. Calm. Everything will be fine. Oh, shit. The game was great. Watched it twice... with the guys. Yeah... Good night. Brian? Oh, Brian. Brian, Brian, Brian, Brian, Brian. What have you been doing? I was out with Lucy. Uh, you know, I was, uh... No, I wasn't. I was out. Yeah, I know. I'm sorry. What are you sorry about? Nothing happened to be sorry about, right? No, something happened. Just like that. Just like that. You're buying houses... without telling me, Aaron. You know, you're naming children. And... It's not my fault. I'm not screwing around. Don't blame me 'cause you're having an affair. I don't know why I did it. I... I, uh... It didn't even mean anything, anyway. Maybe I did it 'cause I'm trying to tell you, and I'm t-trying to tell myself that I'm not happy. Ellen... If I want to get your attention... I don't throw a rock at your head. All you had to do was say something. How could you buy a house without telling me? I love you. That's what you do. You marry, you... you buy a house, you have children. That's what you do. You should have told me. I'm gonna pretend this didn't happen, okay? Uh, neither of us will mention it. I'm sorry... Aaron. Oh, what for? Nothing happened. Nothing's changed. # Your love, lifting me higher # Ciao. # Than I've ever been lifted before # Less. More. Less. More. More. Less. Okay. # You know your love # Your love keeps lifting me # Keep on lifting Um, I'd like the other piece. # Higher and higher # I said your love # Your love keeps lifting me No problem, ma'am. That's what we're here for. # Higher and higher Have a nice day. Sam, are you all right? Guess who's coming to dinner. # Disappointment was my closest friend # # But then you came, and he soon departed # # And you know he never showed his face again # # That's why your love # Your love keeps lifting me Mmm. Oh, mmm. Mmm. Mmm. It's good. Good. Thank you. What is? It's pasta with duck. Dog? Dog? Dog? No. Oh, no, no, no, no, duck. Duck. Um, um, not dog. Not dog. Uh... Duck. Quack, quack, quack. Oh, yeah, yeah. Duck. Little duck. More. We need more wine. I'll go get some, and I will be right back. I go. I go? No, no. You stay, I go. Be right back. Right back. Oh, my God. Stay. Oh. Just... Just stay. Stay. Stay. Hello. Aaah! How much are these potatoes? How... Hello? You're welcome. My name is Inga. Hello? Hello? Hi. Hi. Oh, Inga. Inga, you waited. You are welcome to me. Thank you, God. Hi. Do you know who lives next door? No. No. Ooh! You wouldn't believe what goes on in there. Oooh! This one's a painter. That one's a cook. What about the roses from Brian? Have you, um... Have you seen him in there before? Maybe. I don't know for sure. You don't know? He forgets. Twice a week he comes. Uh, like clockwork. But like I said, it's his own business what he does. And, um... and the girl? Oh, don't know this one. There's another. Oh, oh, painter. Ooh-ooh. Twice a week. Like clockwork. Thank you. I just... I got to go now. But like I said, that's his business. We don't see a thing. Fjord. Oslo. Ahhh. Mm. Mm. Son of a bitch? Son of a bitch? Oh, you no-good son of a bitch! What? What? Okay, where's Brian? Huh? Uh... Who is Brian? I... I... I think that you have the wrong night. No, no, no, stay. Calm down. Oh, bullshit! Calm down. Stay. Where is he? L - lady, please, I beg you. Come out, you son of a bitch! No. no, no, no, no. Stay. No, no, no. I... I can explain. See, I don't actually, uh, live here alone. I mean, I do, when I have the place, but I... I only have the place t - two nights a week. It's kind of a - a timeshare thing. Um, you know, this new york space is tight. No! Lady, stop! Stop! Stop. Stop. Anyway, this woman seems to be looking for one of the co-tenants. And, uh, uh, evidently they've been having some discord. Get out! Get out! Get out! Get out! Get out! Get out! Take it ea... No, Inga. You're welcome to me. You're welcome to me. Out! Inga. Inga! I don't know who you are... or what you're doing here... but I want you to know you have just committed the single cruelest act since they shot Babar's mom. I'm sorry. You're sorry? You come barging into a stranger's house at the worst possible moment, and you have no idea how much I needed or how long I've been waiting for that worst possible moment. You destroyed my one chance of happiness in this world, and you're sorry? I was looking for Brian. Oh, well, he's not here. I'm Sam. This is my night! What does that have to do with anything?! Have you ever heard of knocking before coming into a stranger's home?! Well, I thought that he was having an affair! Brian? The developmentally stunted, consumer-obsessed, color-blind, white-bread-eating man-child trapped in a pudgy body having an affair?! I don't think so! You are talking about my husband-to-be. I have never actually met him. I'm just piecing it together from clues. Well, he's having an affair. You're gonna marry him. You have to sleep with him. From what I can tell, he uses this place as a clubhouse. It's some kind of tree house for him and his fraternity friends. They're brokers. Sue me. I thought that he was having an affair. Lady, is it possible that you're being sexually paranoid? Who would sleep with this palooka? A painter. Ellen? Twice a week for months. How do you know? The neighbors. I don't even have to know the woman, and she betrays me. You're in love with her, too. This is disgusting. Calm down, lady. I don't even know her. We wrote each other a few notes. I built a window box for a basil plant. She went nuts on me. Well, I'm gonna kill him. And the wedding's off. Shut up. You're upset. Your feelings are hurt. Try to keep some perspective. You love this guy. Have you eaten? I thought I did. You love him... So if you want him back, you'll get him back... Just as long as you don't freak out. Sex is a little bit like politics. The incumbent always has the advantage. How romantic. When something like this happens, the best thing you can do is just accept it. If you try to make him do something that he doesn't want to do, he'll resent it. And it'll come up later somehow. Did you cook this? Look, all that i'm saying is... you can't change somebody... not overnight. If you take away his freedom, he'll feel it... choked. That's probably why he kept this apartment in the first place. If you let him choose, he'll choose you. Boy, Sam, I'll bet you're really good at relationships. Me? A genius. Mmm. This is really good. Thank you. Do you have wine? Yeah, sure. Brian, you're awake. We need to talk. It's okay. We don't have to talk. We're both a little jumpy these days, and, uh... I think it's only natural. Shh. Uh-oh. Here he comes. So, uh, if you could tell Mr. Jameson we can, uh, do a lunch at, uh, 2:00 at Raul's. Cut it off! Cut it off! Cut it off! Huh! Whoo-whoo-whoo! Wiggy, wiggy, wiggy! Wiggy, wiggy, wiggy! Well... guys, you've, uh... really outdone yourselves this time. This is really, uh... thoughtless. Mrs. Winkler, could you dispose of this? A - and also, I... I think it's time we got... rid of the lion's den. So notify the tenants. Ellen? Sorry. Thanks. Thanks for the rush. I got a really big night on the town tonight. Oh, yeah, you want to take my wife? She likes big nights out on the town. Right, Marty? Uh... All right, thanks. Hi. Hi. I spilled some wine. I'm afraid it's ruined. Hi, Aaron. Hi, Suzanne. How are you? Good. You are so lucky to have him. Anyway, it's, uh... I think it'll come out. No one will notice. You see how she thinks, Marty? Ellen, this is silk. Don't listen to her promises. We can touch it up. It won't go away. He's so honest. Thank you. See you. Bye. Ellen, if it's ruined, tell them it's ruined. My wife... thinks she can fix everything. Everything can be fixed. Oh! I knew we should have taken Northern Boulevard. Aaron, it happens. We took a wrong turn, and we're stuck in traffic. Right. Right. Fast. Right? Right, fast. It's moving now. All right. Move. All right! Right Le... No, you missed it. You missed it. Oh, this is great. I told you the right lane. you don't listen. You're so stupid. Why don't you let me drive? Now what? You want to drive? Drive. Fellas, fellas, fellas, it's a private party. Get bent, man. I think you're a cowboy... Samuel, one codependents anonymous meeting, just one. Look what it's done for me. Shit! Uh-oh! Club-soda stain. Better get a little red wine. It'll lift that club soda right out of there. Pastel. Oh, Sammy! Sammy! How the hell are you? Oh, do you have my VCR tape? Oh, jeez, I... I didn't know that you were gonna be at the gallery, so I didn't bring it. But I have it, and I'm sure that I can get it to you some other time. Aah! I'm over her. You're better off. What? You're better off. Yeah. Uh, come, Sammy. Let's dance. Oh. I don't know if... Aah! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Excuse me. Ow! Come. come, come, come, come. Come on. Come, come. I'm kind of drunk, Pastel. I don't think this is a good idea. Yes, it is. Bark, bark. Come on. Whoo! Pastel, you can't do this. Why not? Come on, stop. Uh... No, no, no. Get up. You can't... Get up. Ooh-whee! You can't keep picking people up and using them whenever you want to. Oh! Since when? Sammy, why are you so serious? Pastel. Just cut the shit, Pastel! It's enough! Aah! Aah! Aah! Oh! Goodbye, Pastel. Bye... everybody. It's been a great party. See you, kids. Bye. Oh, merci. It's okay. So I'm alone now. Lots of people are alone, and they love it. Hermits are alone. Mass murderers. Postal clerks. It's not so bad. At least I've got the place. The hearth. The sanctuary. Hmm. "Eviction notice. "Amigos... "our noble experiment has come to an end. "Thanks for sharing with me. Brian. P.S. please have all your stuff out by monday. " "Thanks for sharing with me. " Oh, great. Just great. One day left... No girl. No food. No brandy. Inga! I should pack. Oh, forget it. Go to sleep. In the morning... everything... is going to look a lot worse. Ah. Fuck. Hey. Excuse me. Who are you? What are you doing here? I'm sorry. My grandmother made this. It's nice. I... I use it when I'm here. Oh, great. Do you also read my mail? Look, I'm sorry. I... I... I... I was... I was stuck in the city, and I... I tried to call my sister, and she wasn't home, and then I didn't have anyplace else to go, so I... Save it, save it, save it. I'm Ellen. Oh... You're Ellen... the crazy painter lady who yelled at me because I put your basil plant in a window box that I built all by myself. No, no, you see, I thought Brian made the boxes and... Brian's the guy who treated your plants like dirt, so you slept with him. I'm the guy who left the notes and leftovers and did stuff around the house, so you treated me like dirt. That's not fair. Are you crazy? I know it's not fair. It's what you did. Yeah, well, you're not... get mad at me about it. Listening to me. Why don't men ever listen? Go away. Come in. Who is it? Who is this clown? Dartmouth, class of '84. Dartmouth, class of '84. Brian, meet Sam... the woman-hater. Oh, hey. Nice to meet you. Sorry to burst in on you two lovebirds, but, uh... Forgot my tux. Ahh. I don't want to keep my little girl waiting at the altar, you know what I mean? Hey, can you tie this? Yeah, sure. why not? Oh, thanks. Anything he says... see what I mean? What's his problem? What's my problem? You're throwing me out on the street with no notice. I don't know what her problem is. Well, I'm sorry, compadres, but, uh... You got to do what you got to do. Know what I mean? Thanks, babe. Mmm. Adios, amigos. Take care, man. Well, listen, I'm sorry that I yelled at you before. But I'm... I... How can you sleep with a guy like that? You idiot! I didn't mean to sleep with him! I meant to sleep with you! Oh, well... Well, that's okay. You don't have to say that. No. well, I did. I bought clothes. And I bought good food, 'cause I know you like food. And I even bought caviar. Chinese caviar? Yes. I just... had the days confused, and... Oops. I'm sorry. Listen, guys, you know, I just realized something. Just 'cause I'm giving up the place doesn't mean, uh... I'll tell Mrs. Winkler to sublet it to the two of you... for a while. Uh, Brian? Hey, pal, let me give you a tip. One drink, and she's yours. Arrivederci! Yeah! Wiggy, wiggy, wiggy, wiggy! He's not such a bad guy. Maybe I found a better guy. I'm Sam.
