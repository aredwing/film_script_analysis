She was a dealer, right? Black jack? Or was it poker? Doesn't really matter now, does it? Now, it's all over and done with. You woke up with the prettiest girl you've ever seen lying in your bed, cheap ring around her finger, and a $50 receipt from the little white chapel crumpled up on the floor. You don't even know how to spell her name, but it doesn't matter. You only know you love her and it's real and you'd do anything for her. Sucker. Go on, look at yourself. If you knew then what you know now, would it make any difference? Do you think you could save her? Do you think you could save yourself? Wake up, sleepy head. Not exactly four-star room service, but we aim to please. That's so sweet. -I didn't exactly marry you for money. -That was your first mistake. That was it right there. Did you feel that? -What? -The moment. -What moment? -The moment I've been looking for. Ever since... Ever since I quit my job and cleaned out my bank account, hit the road, I've been waiting. I've just been... No, longer than that. When I was 16 years old, I saw a girl on a train, platinum-blond hair, beautiful. All I wanted to do was take her away to live with me for the rest of my life. But you know what? I couldn't even say hello. I followed her out of the station. She went one way and I went the other, and ever since then I've been... I've been waiting for... Waiting, waiting. Just goes to show you, you know? Anything can happen. -Anything. -Anything. -Come on. -Thank you. We got a long haul ahead of us. I'm still tired. You can sleep in the car. I'll grab some coffee. Pretty, isn't she? Hell of a world. Yeah, it's a shame. -So, driving across the desert tonight? -Yeah. -Vacation? -I wouldn't... -Or just married? -Yeah. -Congratulations. -Thank you. Careful on those roads tonight, son. People get lost out there and never heard from again. Just ask her and her boyfriend. Time gets slippery out there, roads dead end, things double back. -Just stay on 95. It'll take you all the way. -Thanks for the tip. And take care of that new wife of yours. Here you go, doll. -Thanks. -You betcha. All right. Let's get out of here. Weirdoes are taking over. -What? -Nothing. Let's hit it. One last look. You've done this before, right? -Driven across the desert at night? -It's the only way to beat the heat. Why did you stop? The sign back there... You got a map in here? Yeah. Thank you. Let's see here. First we went here, and then we went there... -Hey, hey. -...got us lost, and then we ended up here. -We're supposed to be on the 93. -So? We're on the 95. That's not so bad, only two off. You're not one of those never-make- the-wrong-turn kind of guys, are you? I never turned. Must have been on the 95 the whole time. Shit. Good thing we're not on a schedule. Pay attention to the road this time, loser. You're the navigator. -This is what happens when you fall asleep. -Try to figure it out. All right, anything but country. What if I like country? Well, then I guess we have our first tussle there, little lady. Good thing we're on our honeymoon. Come on. I paid a grand for this thing. -I like this car. -Well, you get what you pay for. -ls that better? -That's much better. Old man. All right, I'm turning now. You're my witness. Only 22 miles off. Not so bad. Do you think we're crazy? Great. You're having second thoughts. It's... What time is it? Only about your sense of direction. No. It's just, I'm not an impulsive person. Hey, I'm just thrilled I'm sober and you're still pretty. Jerk. You better turn out to be a nice guy or I'll kick your ass. That's a lovely thing to say to your husband. -Our first day as man and wife. -lf you haven't noticed, it's night. You know, I'm not a big fan of that. No? You didn't seem to have a problem with it last night. Last night? -You could've shot me in the head... -Well, I'll quit... ...I wouldn't have noticed last night. ...tomorrow or when we have kids anyhow. You do want kids, don't you? I told you, I'm old-fashioned. Kids, dog, house, white picket fence, the works. Why don't we start small? Maybe a little apartment, a couple of houseplants, cat. -A cat? You a cat person? -Sure. No. I love pussies. -Don't. -Cats. You feel that? It's so hot. It's like an oven outside, it's so hot. -Should've changed out of this dress. -No, I like it. Yeah. -You mean you like how my tits look in it. -That, too. I'm sweaty, hot. Well, have a drink. There's some water in the cooler. It's a good idea. Even better. Jesus. Old-fashioned? Beautiful. Sweet Jesus. What's this? How come I never saw that before? Chinese. It means trust. -I love the Chinese. -Me, too. Chinese food, Chinese checkers. Pull over. Pull over. Turn off the lights. Oh, shit. -What was that? -Heat lightning. Planning on driving all the way to Sedona like this? You don't realize how much light the stars give out. All the same, let's stick with the lights. -You all right? -God, you hit him. Oh, God. -Shit. -You hit him. No, I didn't. I missed him. -Fuck. -What? God, you hit him. All right. Stay in the car. My God. No other car. Call 911. Oh, God. There's no service. Okay, I need your help. Hurry. Oh, God. You get the feet and I'll get the head. No, no, no, maybe we shouldn't move him. What are we gonna do? We can't just leave him here. -Just go easy. -What do l... Just grab his... Yeah. God... Oh, God. For God's sake. -Okay, get the door. -Okay. Okay. -Okay. -Okay. Wait. Shouldn't you check the other car? Right. No one else. He must have fallen asleep at the wheel or something. Yeah. This goddamn cell phone. Work. Jesus, blood all over my hands. -What are we gonna do? -Almost to the 93. There's gonna be a gas station. There's gonna be a rest area, something. Keep trying that cell. Oh, God, what happened to the road? It's a dead end? Where are we? Shit. Where are we? Jesus. Great. -We're lost, aren't we? -We're not lost. There are plants growing in the middle of the road. Okay, we're just gonna turn around, that's all. We're just gonna backtrack to 95. We're fine. Meanwhile we have a stranger bleeding to death in the back of our car. We don't know how bad that man is hurt. Are you kidding me? He doesn't have a fucking face. You think panicking helps? It'll be all right. Take a deep breath, calm down. All right? Now just put some music on or something. Okay. Why don't you just try AM? It's okay. We're in a shadow zone, that's all. The desert has these pockets... -Dead zones, where... -Dead zones? Nice! Hey, don't worry. We're gonna get help. It'll be fine. -How? -What? How are we going to get help if we don't even know where the fuck we are? Look around. Do you see a light? Do you? No! How could you get us lost? We're not lost. Goddamn road has to lead somewhere, doesn't it? Just keep trying your cell. Doesn't find... There's nothing. Jesus Christ. Hey, wasn't this where we found him? Must have passed it already. There's no car. -See if he's still breathing. -No way. No. He's still got a pulse, but it's weak. He's lost a lot of blood. Fuck. It's your fault, you know. You're the one who's driving. You should know where we're going. Hey, somebody messed with the road signs or something. -Right. -Something. I'm telling you. I didn't make a wrong turn. -Jesus. -So what if I did? This guy would be dead by now if we hadn't come along. Is this how you handle stress? Just go on the attack? We're lost in the desert in the middle of the fucking night. This guy is gonna die if we don't get him help. Thank you for the support. All the same. All? What's that supposed to mean, all? Who all? Not the first impulse you've made on this little drive? No! Hey, buddy. You've been in an accident. We're getting you help. -Oh, God. What... What is this? -It's gonna be all right. We found you on the side of the road. You've been in a bad accident. What the hell is this? Just try to lie back down. We'll be there soon. -Are you okay? -Oh, God! -Take it easy, buddy. It's all right. -No, no. This isn't happening. No. -What? -Stop the car. -I gotta get out. -You're hurt pretty bad. -Let me out! Stop the car! -Take it easy. Come on. -We're trying to get you help. -Stop the fucking car! Hey! Hey! You're in shock. -Where's the highway? -You've been in a bad accident. Where's the highway? Just try to breathe. -Where's the highway? -Almost there. -You two are lost, aren't you? -No, we're not lost. We're fine. Highway's just right up ahead. Did you see anybody else back there? -You mean in the car? -On the road! Did you pass anyone? We haven't seen anyone on this road except for you. This is a fucking nightmare. Just hang in there, buddy. We're getting you help fast as we can. We're gonna get you to a hospital. -Okay? -I don't think we're gonna make it. Lie back down. Try to relax. I think I need a cigarette. Might not be such a great idea. Cigarette. Light. I wouldn't move around too much if I were you. Get away from him. Excuse me, you okay? Look, if you're in some kind of trouble... It's fine, you don't have to talk. You'd like that, wouldn't you, if I just kept my mouth shut? -Dick. -Hey, take it easy. You don't have any fucking idea of what's going on here, do you? Man, we're just trying to... Wait a minute. What did you say? Do I know you? What do you mean? My name, you said my name. Dick. Richard, actually. You look like a Dick. Hey, pal, we're just trying to help you here. You know? -Yeah, don't mind me. I'm delirious. -Jesus Christ. Okay, Dick, I got a little question for you. You ready? -You ever been to Cheetahs? -Cheetahs? What's that? A little strip club, downtown Vegas. -Can't say that I have. -That's too bad, you know. It's a nice place. There are good girls there. Who are you talking about? They're just doing what they have to do to survive. Right? Hey, pal, what're you saying? You trying to freak us out? I'm sorry. I don't want to upset you. It's just... It's been a little bit of a rough night, you know? For all of us. All right, buddy, all right. Hey, you better tell us what happened back there, huh? Have you ever been murdered before? Buddy, what the fuck is your problem? -Sorry, Dick... -It's Richard. Look, we're trying to be good people here. But if you're gonna be a nutcase, I'll kick you back out on that road. I don't give a damn how bad you're hurt. You got it? I'm sorry. You do something we should know about? Somebody after you? -No. -You in some kind of trouble? Let's just drive. -I'm just scared. -Let's just get him where he needs to go. -Don't... -Let's get out of here. -Don't leave me. -Let's go. Oh, yeah. All right. All right. Let's get you to a hospital. Is that the freeway? Thank God. We're there. Only way out. We're gonna get you help, buddy. One way out. And I didn't ever want to hurt you. Get off of him, motherfucker! Stop it. Stop it. He tried to kill me. You saw, he attacked me. "Only way out." What does that mean? I don't know. The fucking guy is obviously crazy. He tried to kill you. He tried to kill you. Jesus Christ, what are we gonna do? Go to the police. Tell them what happened. We were... I picked him up, tried to help him. He attacked me. I didn't have a choice. It was... It was self-defense. Self-defense? Look at him. You think they're really gonna believe that? Does that look like self-defense to you? No. No! We picked him up just like it happened, and he died on the way to get help. Look... Look, I'm not an expert on police forensics or anything, but I don't think it's gonna take a genius to figure out what happened here, you know, especially since I'm wearing most of his brains. Let's just leave him. Let's leave him. Let's get the fuck out of here. You realize what this will do? We leave him here, we're tied to this. Our lives are over. You know that, don't you? If they don't believe us. Well, let's just take him on our honeymoon. "Pardon me, do you have a valet for our luggage? "And don't mind the dead body." This isn't happening. This isn't happening. This can't be happening. We'll bury him. Bury him. Out there with the scorpions and the snakes, no one will ever find him. No one. Ever. Yeah. He knew your name. How'd he know your name? Satisfied? This is crazy, but I'm gonna ask. You didn't know that guy from somewhere, did you? -What are you talking about? -I don't know. Vegas or something. I've never seen that fucking guy in my life before. -Don't know him. Never met him. -Okay, forget it. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Hey. Hey. Remember this? Yeah. -He's still alive. -He's dead. He's... -He's not... -Listen. Just listen. You heard it. -I heard something. -What if he's alive? What are you gonna do? I don't know. He could talk. He could lie. He could say that you attacked him. Fuck. -This far enough? -No. Keep going. If I gotta do this by myself, we're gonna be out here all night. Okay. -You ready? -Yeah. We're not being smart about this. -They always find the body. -They're not going to find this body. How can you be sure? What if an animal digs it up? Let's hope it's hungry. Jesus. Maybe you should just turn yourself in. Well, you're the one who killed him. It's just... Let's get something straight. We're in this together, for better or for worse, remember? I'm sure this is what they had in mind. Look, we're gonna get through this. We're gonna bury this fucker, get back in the car, drive away and forget it ever happened. We're going to get to Sedona, fuck our brains out, and then we're going to figure out what to do for the rest of our lives. -You got it? -Yeah. Good. Keep digging. -Fuck. -Fuck. Damn it. We gotta make it longer. -Can't we just make him shorter? -Shorter? Yeah. Can't you just, I don't know, cut his head off? Don't look at me like that. You had no problem bashing his fucking brains in. Cover him up. That side, over there. Hell of a honeymoon, huh? Shit! Oh, shit. Please, please, God. Let's get the hell out of here. Well, that's the last time I cross the desert without a gun. Have you ever used a gun? I hate guns. I guess this one doesn't count, huh? -You went through my fucking purse? -I'm allowed. I'm your husband, remember? I was going to tell you about the gun, about everything once we were in Sedona, once we were safe. Safe? From what? Not what, who. I bought that gun from a friend for protection. What are you telling me? Remember that I told you I had been working at the Hard Rock? Yeah. Well, I haven't always been a dealer. When I first got to town three years ago, I didn't have a nickel to my name, and I had to eat. You know, I was just doing what I had to do to survive. There were a lot of girls in the same boat, nice girls, and some of them danced at this little club on the strip, and they always had money. One night, I just went along out of curiosity. It was a lot easier than I thought. Let me guess, Cheetahs. Yeah. Yeah. Fuck. Fuck. He... There was this one guy, real creepy. He used to come in every night and became a little fixated on me. You mean you fucked him? No. No, I didn't fuck him. I didn't fuck anybody. So, was he the one, this creep? -ls he? -I don't know. You don't know? Well, was he or wasn't he? -Maybe. -Maybe? I don't know, maybe. It's hard to tell when a guy doesn't have a face. Jesus. Something happened when we were at the diner before we left town. Pretty, isn't she? Take care of that new wife of yours. And you didn't tell me? -Well, I thought he was a fucking nutcase. -He is a fucking nutcase. That's my point. -Was it him? Was it the same guy? -I don't know. I don't know. Doesn't really matter now anyway, does it? What matters is it's over and done with. -Yeah. -Are you okay? I mean, are we okay? I'm not using you. I'm not. All right. We're gonna go get cleaned up. We're gonna find out where the fuck we are, and we're gonna get back on the main highway, all right? Yeah. Sorry. Where are my shorts? Here. -You ready? -Yeah. Okay, let's go. -What? -We gotta go back. -What? -My watch. I lost my fucking watch. -Who cares? Just leave it. -I can't. -My name... -Why not? My name is engraved on the back of the watch. I know. -Stupid. -Yeah. I don't see anything else we can do. I mean, fuck, you think I want to go back there? Look, babe, if we don't stick together on this, we're done for. Done for? We're already done for. Gina, what are you doing? -What are you doing? -What does it look like I'm doing? What, are you walking... Fuck. What are you... You're leaving? -What, are you gonna walk back to Vegas? -lf I have to. Hey. Hey! -Hey, hey, hey, hey. -Don't touch me. -Come here, come here, come here. -Get off... Just give me my shit. Walking out after what you've pulled? Where are you going? You tell me what's going on right now. I pulled? Wanna tell me what's going on here now? -What are you talking about? -Who is he? Your boyfriend? Did you owe him money? I mean, what is it? Just tell me. What? -You're crazy. -I just wanna know what you're getting me into here. -Me? -Yeah. We wouldn't be in this fucking mess if it weren't for you. You know, you're right. I'd be halfway to Sedona now with my new wife. You know? The one with the gun in her purse who flaunts her pussy in other men's faces. You fucking asshole. Fucking asshole. Keep your voice down. Hey, keep your voice down. -I don't... -Quiet. -There's people sleeping in these cars. -I don't give a shit. -You killed him, not me. -Shut the fuck up. I knew this was a bad idea. I don't know what I was thinking. I don't even know you. -Gina. -We're lost in the middle of nowhere. We've been attacked by a fucking psycho, I watch you commit murder and help you bury a body on the first day of our fucking marriage. -This is not how it's supposed to be. -All right. Gina... I think it's best if we just forget the whole thing, if we just pretend we never met. Fine. Walk away. Why don't you just go to the police while you're at it? Make up any story you want. I'm sure they're gonna believe an old-fashioned girl like you. Why did you lie to me? Why did you lie? Gina, look, I know l... Things happened fast between us and we had a plan, you know. Start a new life together. Well, I still want that life. So, you gotta decide right here, right now, what do you want? Don't make me go back there. I can't go back there, please. Just don't make me go back. -Don't make me go, please. I can't go back. -Okay. Okay. -Please. -Okay. Okay. You can stay here. You're gonna be in the lights. -Wait for me. -Okay. Yeah. Here. Here, take it. Don't move from this spot. Don't talk to anyone. Just stay in the light. I won't be long. We'll get out of this. Whatever happened back in Vegas doesn't matter because I love you. I know I love you. I knew it from the moment I laid eyes on you. -I'll be right back. -Promise? Promise. Come on, where are you? You didn't know that guy from somewhere? I've never seen that fucking guy in my life before. -You ever been to Cheetahs? -Don't know him. Never met him. And I didn't ever want to hurt you. Okay. What the hell... No. No. No. No, no, no, no. No! I killed you! You were dead! I killed you! Gina! Gina. Gina. Gina! Gina! Gina! Gina! Gina! Gina! No. No. No. No. No. No. No. It's not her ring. It's not my wife. -Stay where you are. -Help me. Please, it's my wife. Stay where you are. You don't understand. She's missing. -Don't move. -She's missing. Don't move! Put your hands where I can see them. You gotta help me find her, please. -Sir, you have some identification? -Yeah. Yeah. Here. Wait here. Wait. What's this you were saying about your wife? My wife, she's out there somewhere. Now, I found these tracks, right? But they weren't hers. -Oh, God. -All right now, calm down. Let's just start from the beginning... I don't have any time. Something could happen to her. Sir, I can't help you if I don't know what happened. Look, we were driving to Sedona, all right? My wife and I just got married. We were in Vegas. -It's not like that. We're in love. -Well, of course you are. So, we stopped at that rest area a couple of miles back down the road, and I went to the bathroom, and I came out, and she was gone. I looked everywhere. We picked up this guy. We were trying to help him, but I think he took my wife because I found tracks leading off into the desert, right? And I followed them, and they led to a grave, and I dug around, and I uncovered a hand, a woman's hand. She was just buried out there in the desert. But it wasn't her, not my wife. I don't know. It's like he's fucking with me or something. So, I panicked. I ran back, got in the car, drove somewhere, anywhere to find help. That's when you came along. That's one hell of a story. -Can we go find my fucking wife? -All right, now calm down. -Calm down? He could have her. -You say you found a woman... He's obviously killed that other woman. -...but it wasn't your wife. -No! All right, then why don't we just go back to the rest area? Fine. You're gonna leave your car here and ride with me. Front seat's a little crammed up. Why don't you just go ahead and climb on in the back? Don't worry, pal. We'll find your wife. Your wife, has she got any enemies? Anybody wanna hurt her? No. Not that I know of. The reason I ask is people tend to marry in Vegas for a lot of reasons, good and bad. Just told you it's not like that. No, no, I remember you said you were in love. Still, I've never been much of a believer in that love-at-first-sight stuff. Maybe... Maybe that's why I never married. I've seen stuff out here I wouldn't confess to a priest. Yeah, I bet. We call this part of the desert the garbage dump, only the garbage is human. Murder victims. Mob hits mostly, but other stuff, too, you know. That body you found, dollar to donuts, I bet you that leads right back to Vegas. We see it all out here, man. Prostitutes, strippers, gambling debts. -Your wife into any of that crap? -No! I already told you. What the hell is this, for Christ's sakes? Hey, hey, hey. Take it easy. I gotta ask, you know. Leave no turn unstoned. Hey, maybe she just got cold feet, you know, about the marriage. -I've seen that before. -What about that rest area? -Thompson, do you copy? -Yeah, this is Thompson. Go ahead. Yeah. Yeah. -Okay, I'll be right there. -What? -ls she okay? Where is she? -She's out in the desert... -The deputies are with her. -ls she alive? -ls she all right? Talk to me. -Hey, settle down. We'll be there in a few minutes. Just hold on. Is that it? Coming up there. It's a... What is that, a flare? Gum? I only got one piece. Holy shit. I know these cars. They were parked at the rest area. How the fuck did they get here? They... What are they doing? Where are we? Where's my wife? What's going on? What about the rest area? This is the rest area. At least it was 30 years go. Jesus. Where's my wife? More light! No! No, no, no. No, no, no, no. Jesus! No. No! No! No! No! No! God! No! Oh, God. Oh, God. Got another one here. I told him to stay on 95. My God. Looks like some of these cars have been out here for years. Bet you some of these women they're digging up will match the plates. The real question is where the hell are all the men? Well, why don't you ask him? Get on him! -Go! Let's go! -Crazy fuck. Dispatch 348, we are in pursuit. A suspect has fled. It is a late '60s model, blue, light blue Mustang. A suspect has fled. It is a late '60s model, blue, light blue Mustang. Get out of the way. Get out of the way. I can't see a damn thing. Oh, shit. -I don't have a beat on him. -This is car 54, at bottom now. The suspect is passing me now. -He's headed into the wash. -Stay with him now. Stay with him! We're in the wash, heading west. We're right on top of him. I got him. I got him. Going ahead. This is Tomkin. This bastard's coming right at me. Crazy son of a bitch. He just passed me. He's still at me. -What happened? -God damn it. -All right. Who's got him? -I'm on his tail. He's still in the canyon, heading east. I've got him. I've got him. He's heading... Do not lose him. He's pulling away. The suspect is pulling away. Somebody tell me you got him. I don't got him. I'm losing him. All right, I got him. I'm on him. I'm on him. Heading southwest. Stay with me, boys. We've got backup. We're going right at you. We're headed right at... -We're gonna box him in. -What the fuck? Do you have a visual? Turned his goddamn lights off. -Where'd he go? -I lost him. -Where the fuck is this guy? -Anybody got a 20 on him? -Anybody see him? -Oh, fuck! Look out! God damn it. -How the fuck did you lose him? -You said you had him. -What the hell just happened? -Don't give me that shit. -What's going on out there, fellas? -Anybody got him? We were right on him. All right, mister. You fuck. I'll find you. You killed my wife. You set me up. I'll find you. I will find you, and I will kill you, wherever you are. You didn't know that guy from somewhere, did you? He knew your name. How'd he know your name? Get away from him. I never wanted to hurt you. We're lost in the desert in the middle of the fucking night. This guy is gonna die if we don't get him help. Thank you for the support. -All the same. -All? What's that supposed to mean, all? Not the first impulse you've made on this little drive? No! Hey, buddy. You've been in an accident. We're getting you help. -It's gonna be all right. -What is this? We found you on the side of the road. -You've been in a bad accident. -What the hell is this? Just try to lie back down. We'll be there soon. Oh, God. -Take it easy, pal. We're your friends. -No, no. This isn't happening. -We'll get you help. -My wife... Stop the car. Let me out. Let me out now. I gotta get out. -Just take it easy. Come on. -Stop the fucking car! We're trying to get you help here. Jesus. -Hey. -Where's the highway? Where's the highway? This is your wakeup call. At the tone... Wake up, sleepy head. That was your first mistake. That was it right there. Did you feel that? -What? -The moment. -What moment? -The moment I've been looking for. Ever since... Ever since I quit my job and cleaned out my bank account, hit the road, I've been waiting. I've just been... No, longer than that. When I was 16 years old, I saw a girl on a train, platinum-blond hair, beautiful. All I wanted to do was take her away to live with me for the rest of my life. But you know what? I couldn't even say hello. I followed her out of the station. She went one way and I went the other, and ever since then I've been... I've been waiting for... Waiting. Just goes to show you, you know? Anything can happen. -Anything. -Anything. Come on.
