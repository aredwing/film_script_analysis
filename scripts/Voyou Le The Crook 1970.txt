LE LITTRE Want something to drink? A beer. Without foam! Thank you. Are you hungry? Yes. What are you doing here? Making an omelet. No, I mean in Paris. I work as a secretary. And you? Are you in the habit of yanking the telephone out of the wall? When I don't know the people. Want some wine? I wouldn't mind some more beer, if you've got some. It's nice to know you trust me. Aren't you eating? No, I ate before the movies. Do you go to the movies a lot? Were you thinking of staying long? Overnight, at least. - When do you leave for work? - I leave here at 8:00. That's all I can do for you. Anyone else got a key? - Just the cleaning woman. - Does she come every day? Every other day. Why are they looking for you? You got anything to smoke? - Why are you so nervous? - I couldn't be calmer. You don't have many visitors. Now look, I have a car... I'm willing to drive you anywhere. Tomorrow you won't be going to work. They'll want to know why I'm not there. And since my telephone doesn't work, they'll investigate. You'll be sick. - I haven't been sick in 10 years. - Then obviously it's time you were. Is the cleaning lady coming tomorrow? Yes. Tell her you won't be needing her. Send her to your boss to explain. - And have her bring the newspapers up. - What on earth for? Because you'll be sick. Tell me... do you plan on staying much longer? You'd better be nice to me because I've had a very trying day. What's the matter with this? She's very pretty. So are you. - May I give her a kiss? - Franoise! The gentleman wants to give you a kiss. Thank you. All right now, go and play with your friend. - How were you able to find me? - I'll tell you later. Did the cops question you? Yes, they have. They came to the house right after you escaped from jail. I said I didn't know anything but the truth. Your husband? He took it well. He was afraid because he thought you'd phone. What does he take me for? Where have you been for the last 15 days? With a girl I know. Do I know her? No. The night I escaped, I ran into her by accident. And she's hiding you. Yes. She hid you for 15 days? At first I forced her, then she cooperated. - Is she an old friend? - Not at all. You're sure you're not being followed? They seem to think that I left the country. You didn't lose much weight. The girl I'm staying with cooks up a storm. I want to kiss you so badly. Did you hear? My daughter is very beautiful. What will you do now? Now I'm really going to leave the country. Why didn't you leave before? I wanted to see her. Do you need money? We'll see. What country will you go to? I haven't decided yet. - Do have a car? - Yes. Will you give me a lift? There's someone I've got to see. Yes, but I have to take her home first. Franoise, did you hurt yourself? How did you get to know him? We met not long after Franoise was born, on the Riviera. Is he loaded, as they say? You'd never believe how much yogurt people eat. You told him everything? After your trial, the entire country knew about you and me. - Has he been good with Franoise? - Yes, wonderful. I suppose you're a yogurt fan now? You know what surprises you most when you get out of prison? New clothes... and the price of movie tickets. What are you doing, Franoise? She's only playing. Is that your place? It's a bit farther up the street, but I'd rather not park any closer. Give the nice man a kiss, Franoise. Goodbye, sweetheart. You're a good girl. Come on, darling. I'll only be a minute. I like you better that way. I was angry with you for a long time. But eventually I saw your side. I figured you were better off... married to someone rich, handsome, young, honest... Is he really honest? What I'll never quite understand is why he married you. Do you think she'll say anything? I'm going to tell him anyhow. I want you to drive. It's too risky this way. Don't you want to kiss me? I'd like you to drive. - How much is this one? - Four bills. She's sweet, neat, and reliable. - And this one? - It's less. But the problem is keeping her loaded. It's an odd caliber. Where are you going? I want this one. Nice balance. How much? Four bills. How about throwing in some bullets? You know, I thought you skipped the country. Well, go on thinking it. I've got a job if you want. I only work alone, you know that. - Have you seen Martine? - She's waiting in the car for me. If I were you, I wouldn't treat her so nice. If you were me, but you're not. What are you going to do with this place? I thought I'd open up a little club for special tastes. - I see you've been letting your hair grow. - Don't you dig it on me? It's all right. Well, I'll see you. I got to put this stuff away. You know the way out. Which will it be? That one. Well, intellectual. - You still have an official source of supply? - Yeah, sure. The bastards keep upping the price. Know what a full set comes to now? - Have you seen Martine? - She's waiting outside. You know what you're doing. How's Charles? - Great, still eats like a horse. - Good old Charles. There we are. What name shall I put down for you this time? Edouard Faures. Spelled with an "S." NAME: FAURE - Always the name of a big wheel. - Impresses the cops. With an "S," I said. I don't want to be hauled in for impersonation. - You feel like playing poker tonight? - No, I better not. I guess you're right. How many driver's licenses do you want me to make? Two. One with a mustache and one without. I threw in a vaccination certificate. You're vaccinated for everything: Smallpox, cholera, the works. Thanks, doc. Will you let me borrow your car? Yes, of course. In a day or two, it will turn up at one of the borders. Take care of yourself, Simon. Your escape was great. Thanks. We'll have our coffee now. Do you know what this is? It's a yogurt. - The world's very first yogurt in a can. - I saw Simon. I'll look in on Franoise. Excuse me. The papers said he must have left the country. It's amazing how wrong they can be. I saw him this afternoon at the park. Was Franoise with you? I set up a lawyer's practice after I got my degree. It's true. My first client seemed like a nice person... someone who dropped out of the blue because he thought I was brilliant. "I'm known as the Al Capone of France," he said. "I'm a gangster, and I'm called the Al Capone of France. "Now, since you're a young lawyer, I have a proposal for you. "To hire you by the year. "You'll be paid quite a lot, just as long as I'm free. "As soon as I go to prison, you won't be paid." - It's true. What, you don't believe me? - It's unbelievable. Then he said to me, "You'll be my adviser... "and each time I decide to set up a deal, you can give me legal advice beforehand." Well, the first job that came up was so beautiful. I couldn't help saying, "Sir, if you don't mind, I'll work with you." - Good evening. - Police. I'd like to speak to Mrs. Zimmer. Just a second. I'll see if she's in. There are two gentlemen from the police. Would you like a little more couscous? It's good. Don't you like it? You don't sound like it. The last time I had it I was in Kiruna, in a place that catered to Eskimos. Now you're making fun of me. In the papers they call you "the Swiss." That or "Simon the Swiss." Clockwork precision. Also because... I've got a reputation for working alone. Do you want the television on? I'm leaving tonight. Thank you. I'll get it. Are you alone? My wife's here. Suppose you call her. Come on, call her. - Baby doll. - Yes? - Yes, what is it? - Come here. - Is there anyone else? - The maid. Where is she? - Where? - In the kitchen. - Do you have a dog? - Yes. Call him. - Othello. - No, louder. He's just a little puppy. Get over to the window. What is going on? Turn around and face the curtains. If anyone moves, I'll shoot. I said, don't move. Now sing along with me. He was a simple little sailor Let's hear it. Sing or I'll shoot. He was a simple little sailor He was a simple little sailor First one to turn gets plugged. Who dreamed of ship, shipping off to sea Who dreamed of ship, shipping off to sea Away! He was a simple little Come on, louder! Let's hear it. He was a simple little sailor Who dreamed of ship, shipping off to sea We are sure your wife saw Simon after he broke out of jail. But he's out of the country. No, he never left the country. Right, Mrs. Zimmer? I want you to know, Inspector... for five years there hasn't been anything between my wife and that man. She hasn't even seen him. I have. When? This afternoon. What did he say? Nothing. He wanted to see his daughter. To see his daughter. That's all. Where have you hidden him since his escape? I don't know where he's been. I just saw him for a minute. He wouldn't have mentioned where he was headed? Yes. Where? Spain. Why are you being so free with your information? I've nothing to hide. And how is he going to get to Spain? I've given him my car. What kind of car is it? A gray Peugeot four-door sedan. License number? Have fun in Brussels. If he's in Spain, he must have got in another way. I've been contacted. So has the whole border. Don't worry. I'll call you the minute there's any news. Sure, so long. Either she's giving us the runaround, or he's changed his plans. - Nobody's called her? - Nobody's liable to. - Hello? - Nothing to worry about. - Where are you? - In Italy. Albergo Piccolo in Genoa. Are you alone? That girl of mine is really beautiful. Now that I've seen her, I can't get her out of my mind. There weren't any problems at the border? - Hello? - No problems. Will you stay there long? Just two or three days. I've got some guys to see. - Will you call me again? - Yes, I'll call you. - Simon. - Hello? I think of you all the time. So do I. How long ago was that call made? Fifteen minutes. See if you can check on that Albergo Piccolo in Genoa. There's no one who fits your man's description staying here. - Good morning. - The town hall, please. But you can walk there. It's just across the street. - I'm tired. - Whatever you say. - That should cover it. - Thank you, sir. - Are you free? Airport, please. - Yes, sir. Are you going to tell me where you are? Switzerland, of course, but keep it to yourself. You have everything you need? No, I'd like some of your couscous. Swiss cooking's nothing to rave about. You don't know how glad I am you called. I was so worried about you. I keep watching the news on TV, the headlines. You don't want me to do anything? No. You mean you don't need me? Not right now. I'll keep in touch with you. How much will it be? Ninety francs with the phone call. You know, this is Brussels. I was about to say, - Thank you very much. - Thank you, sir. - They found the Peugeot. - By the Belgian border. Thank you. Get me Brussels. Hello, Bill. It's me. I'm sure you know who. Listen carefully because I haven't got much time. Yesterday, before I talked to you, one of my buddies bailed me out. That quartet of Beethovens I gave you... one of the four can't play in tune. Do you follow me? Well, it doesn't matter. We'll settle it when you get back. Where are you? London? When you get starved for some good chow... I know a place called Willy's. It's in Soho. Just tell them I sent you. And don't let Beethoven worry you. So long, baby. With any luck he'll turn up at Willy's in Soho. - I hope your information is right. - So long. It seems he called Bill from London. You see? It doesn't mean you have to go to Belgium. I thought it was the police. I'm so glad you are here. How were you able to get back so fast? There's no place like home. Good food, bed, perfect hideout. But did you come back for me, or for a place to hide? For a place to hide. Was it hard to get out of Switzerland? Very. Look, I went to Switzerland to pick this up for you. Smuggling it out was quite a job. You have nothing here but hundreds? Makes it easier to count. Suspicious? No, routine precaution. Mind if I call Paris? Help yourself, you dial 00, then 31. - Yes, who is it? - Hello. - Speak a bit louder. - Hello! - Everything is going as planned? - Everything is going as planned. - No trouble, dear? - No trouble, dear. I'm leaving Geneva tonight. Remember to get the cigars you like. You know, the ones you like best, Habanas. I won't forget. Goodbye, sweetheart. - Goodbye, dear. I love you. - I love you, too. You did that perfectly. You're a real Mata Hari. Good work. The food's not much in Switzerland, huh? Don't believe it. When you know the place, it's really great. The name was Charles, wasn't it? Charlie. No foam on it. Didn't you eat on the plane? Sure, it was great. Tell me, is she okay? Great, this lobster dish, perfect. Wait till you sample her couscous. By the way, there's one thing you never explained to me. The bread. Why didn't you give it to Martine? Because I like her too much. It was the only way to protect her. Everything all right? You got everything? - Just great. - It's fine. The Swiss account number. How's business these days? Rough, very rough. Since the anti-gang unit got involved five years ago... we had to adjust, change everything, start from scratch. The bars, hideouts, rackets... you wouldn't recognize them. Did you find a place? Yeah, can't be beat, real cool. Soundproof, isolated. - How's your ulcer? - It's fine. - Have any trouble finding it? - I found it. - What's his name? - I haven't decided yet. Here, I'll give you a hand. - Have you been here very long? - About two hours. Okay, we've got more important things to do. Here, Charlie. If you pet him, you'll have a friend. This is the mike. You speak directly into it. Not this way or this way. Straight into it, and not too loud. On the left, you've got applause, on the right, music. First button, applause. Mix the two. The timer will automatically connect you. You've got from 10:00 till 10:05, precisely. Your watch? Haven't you got a watch? Here, the text to be read. You have five minutes. - To say all that? - To say all that. I tried it. That's all it takes. Hello, Longchamp 45-85? Yes. Good evening to you. Your number is Longchamp 45-85? Yes. Hold the line, please, we've got a wonderful surprise for you. Well, madam, if your number is Longchamp 45-85... Yes, that's my number. - And if you're married... - Yes, I'm married. - And if you have children... - I have a child. You have a son, fine. You're the winning family in our contest on Europe Number One: "A Date with Lady Luck." - What is she talking about? - How do I know? - Hello? - Hello. Now as quickly as possible, a very brief explanation. We are broadcasting from the Olympia Music Hall in Paris... with the star of tonight's show, Sacha Distel. Sacha Distel, yes. Your number, Longchamp 45-85... was chosen in tonight's drawing. And thanks to Lady Luck, you and your husband... have won a new Simca station wagon. And for your son we have a superb mini Matra sports car junior. Oh, it's marvelous! Hello? Hello, miss? There's just one more thing. You have a half-hour to bring your family to the Olympia Music Hall... and pick up your gifts, courtesy of Simca. - There must be a catch. - Hello? In two minutes, we'll present the Sacha Distel Show, lasting for one hour. You absolutely must not miss the last half-hour of the show... because you'll be asked a question about this last half-hour. And finally, will you bring a recent phone bill... to prove your number is really Longchamp 45-85? And you must come to the Olympia in a Simca taxi. You'll take a Simca taxi, right? We'll never find a Simca cab. A gentleman will meet you there and give you your tickets. You'll be ushered to your seats... where you'll wait for the grand finale. Give your son the telephone bill that proves you're really Longchamp 45-85. After the show is over, your son will go on stage... and collect his Matra junior from Lady Luck. - Hello? - Yes? Hello? What about us? Just one last reminder, you have one half-hour... to get to the Olympia Music Hall by Simca taxi. Are you serious? The audience here at the Olympia would love to hear you scream: "Thank you, Simca." - Thank you, Simca. - Thank you. Is your son there? How about him saying, "Thank you, Simca"? Oh, yes, he's right here. Daniel, come here, quick. Hurry! Hold on just a second, he's coming to the phone. Loud and clear. Say, "Thank you, Simca." Fantastic. Now may I ask if your husband's there? Thank you, Simca. Well done. What a fabulous family. I'm delighted you're the ones Lady Luck has chosen. May we hear all three together? Thank you, Simca! Wonderful, madam. Hurry. If you have a transistor, you won't miss a minute... of Sacha Distel's show, live on Europe One... until your arrival at the Olympia. Always tune in to Europe Number One. Goodbye, madam. Are we going or not? I hope this whole thing isn't a joke. You never think it will happen to you. - Got the bill? - I've got two. I'll run down to the cabstand. You wait until I come and get you. He's not bad. - Yes. - I can't hear him. Can't hear him? Here. Oh, the good life Taxi. Charles! - The Olympia Music Hall. - I'm sorry, lady, I'm off duty. Please, you've got to help us. - You are driving a Simca? - Last time I looked, yeah. What a break. - The Olympia. - I've already been told. The good life Full of fun, seems to be the ideal Yes, the good life Lets you hide all the sadness you feel Please remember I still love you And in case you didn't know Well, just wake up Kiss the good life hello - Are you Longchamp 45-85? - Yes. - Here, I'll take care of it. - Thank you. I work in the public relations department at Simca. Here, thank you, keep the change. - It sure is a pleasure. - How do you do? - Is this your little boy? - Sure is. - Good evening, young man. - Hello. - Good evening, madam. - How do you do? Did they explain everything on the phone? Pretty much. Well, I'll go over it once more. I've got two tickets for you. An usher will seat you. We go in right away? Yes. You're in the front row. When the performance ends, the child and I will come out on stage... and I will ask him a couple of questions. I'll introduce you, and you'll be asked to go up on stage. - You do have a car, don't you? - Yes. - I see, but not a Simca? - No. No? That's too bad, but it doesn't matter. So what happens? I'll ask you to come up on stage... and I'll ask you a few simple questions. We might make it humorous, just for publicity. - "Thank you, Simca." - Right. - You don't mind, do you? - Of course not. - By the way, what's his name? - Daniel. - You gave him the bill, didn't you? - No. Here, Daniel. There you are. Keep that in your pocket. When I ask you for it, you take it out, but not before. You do just what the man tells you. - Will we see you after the show? - Oh, yes, on stage. Hope you enjoy it. It's been a pleasure to meet you both. Be a good boy, Daniel. Do what the man says. When you write your first song by yourself, you're never sure how good it is. You're always anxious to find out... and the best way to find out is to sing it to a discriminating audience. Well, I'm glad you finally got here. Any later and you'd have had to sing to yourself. Did you miss your subway? - What's that? - Take a look, it's for you. - What is it? - Look and you'll see. - It's a puppy! - Surprise. - Are you giving him to me? - Yes. - You're fooling me. - No. But you cry Too bad for you That'll teach you... You're going to get your car from Santa Claus. - No. - You bet you are. - Santa Claus? - Sure. - Oh, no. - Yes, he's coming tonight. - Santa Claus? - Yes. It's another month, nine months before Santa. No, it's tonight. Tonight, Santa Claus is giving you your car. Raindrops keep falling on my head But that doesn't mean my eyes will soon be turning red Crying's not for me 'Cause I'm never gonna stop the rain by complaining Because I'm free - He's a good driver, isn't he? - He's pretty good. This is fun. - A compliment - Yes - Two compliments - Yes - My affection - And? - That's fine - With style, huh? 8:30, a martini - Two martinis - And? That's fine Daniel, meet Santa Claus. - Hello, Daniel. - Hello, Santa Claus. Excuse me, miss. The Europe Number One contest, when does it start? That's not on tonight, sir. There's no contest tonight? No, it was the live broadcast tonight. The Europe contest is on Thursday. - That's all for tonight? It's over? - That's right, sir. My wife answered the phone. At first, we thought it was a joke. There was a lot of music. A lot of music, and a man's voice. There was a man's voice and a woman's voice. - There were two voices? - Yes, there were two voices. There was a man's voice and a woman's voice... and there was a lot of music. And they said, "Hold on, please." And I figured it was some kind of joke. And then after that... they asked us, "Is this your phone number? "Because if this is your telephone number, then you're the winners. "You're the lucky winners, and you've won a new car." You've just won a brand new car. And we only had half an hour. We were supposed to be there with the phone payment. - We were supposed to take a taxi. - I see. - With the thing. - What thing? With the thing, so they'd know it was our phone. With the receipt. The inspector would like to see you upstairs. See what he wants. I don't have time right now. Why did they want the receipt? Because they picked our telephone number. They had your number, but why did they ask you... Because we won. I suppose it was to show it was us. Because we won. We... Because it was our telephone. We won a car with the phone. The kid, too. They had a car for him. I see. A sort of lottery? That's right, that's what it was. A lottery. It's a lottery. They even made us say, "Thank you, Simca." "Hooray for Simca." Yes, all three of us. And because we had to hurry, we went downstairs... and took a taxi to the Olympia. And when we arrived at the Olympia... we even brought my portable radio so we could follow it. The Sacha Distel show. We were listening to it in the taxi. Why Sacha Distel? Because Sacha Distel was the star of the show. He was the one who was on. But who told you it was Sacha Distel? Was it the voice on the telephone? But we told you. I'm not making myself clear. And when we got there, the Distel show was on. At the Olympia, Sacha Distel. And afterwards... And after we got there... They said we'd be on Europe Number One. It would be after the show. Then these two voices told you over the phone... that Europe Number One was organizing... a contest at the end of a show? - Yes, the Sacha Distel concert. - And so the two of you went there. - No, we took the kid. - I see. - We had to take him along. - You had to take him? Yes, we did. Why did you have to take the child? Under what pretext? So they could give him a car, too. I see, because he won a car in the contest. - They had a car for him, too. - How old is your boy? - He's five. - Five and a half. Yes, it's clear we're dealing with professionals who set you up. They telephoned you and got you to come to the Olympia, they... - What on earth for? - Obviously they're after a ransom. If we don't pay, what'll they do to our son? - You have private means? - No, we haven't any means. I'm a working man. - Where do you work? - I work in the bank. How much do you make a month, if you don't mind my asking? I get 150,000 francs a month. I mean, 150,000 old francs. That's 1,500 new francs. Do you have any wealthy relatives? No. - Do you? - No. No possible inheritance? No. Do you have any enemies? Anyone you consider an enemy? No. Enemies who would kidnap... It's our duty to consider every possible motive, sir. As difficult as this must be for you, you must help us, because... It can't be for money! No question, it's money they want. But we don't have money. It can't be for money. It just isn't possible. Are you involved in politics? - Of course not. - No. And besides, even if we were... Here we go, a kidnapping. Clear the way, stand back. Get back, do you hear? Let them through. Clear the way. Stand back. Let them through. Have you got a message for the kidnappers? Move along. How old is the child? Boy or girl? This is for television. Boy or girl? Right this way, please. Are you the father? If you have a message for the kidnappers, we'll broadcast it on television. All right, I want to tell the kidnappers... that we don't want any harm to come to our little boy... that we'll give them all we've got... that the police will not prosecute them... and that they should give him back to us. And please don't harm the boy. - That's enough. - How old is the boy? Did you get a good look at the kidnappers? At what time did it happen? The car! Get a close-up. All right, I want to tell the kidnappers... that we don't want any harm to come to our little boy... that we'll give them all we've got... that the police will not prosecute them... and that they should give him back to us. And please don't harm the boy. - That's enough. - How old is the boy? Did you get a good look at the kidnappers? At what time did it happen? The car! Get a close-up. What a drag. You watch him, will you? Hey, Martine. Yes? You know something? He's a nice kid, but he wears the hell out of you. Getting old, Grandpa. That's the first and last time I kidnap a kid. After he packs all that away, I hope he goes to sleep. - What's he doing? - Being a pest. Parents tricked into giving child to kidnappers No, thanks. Hello? Yes. No, nothing new yet. Hold on, will you? It was just delivered! They just delivered a letter. Leave them alone! Look at that. Only a minute ago. Hold on, we may have something. Is it the first contact they've made with you? Look, it's hard enough, leave us alone. How much do they want? Do they want to be paid in dollars? Can you tell us the contents of the letter? We just received a letter. Yes. No, it was delivered. Wait, I'll read it to you. "Madam, your little boy, Daniel, is very much alive and well. "No harm whatsoever has come to him. "He's receiving the best care." "Madam, your little boy, Daniel, is very much alive and well. "No harm whatsoever has come to him. "He's receiving the best care. "We have only one reason for taking your boy: "To demand a ransom. "We have set the amount of this ransom at $1 million. "We know very well that you and your husband... "are not in a position to pay such a large sum... "but your husband is an employee in one of the largest banks in France... "and it is this bank you will ask to pay the money. "A period of 24 hours will be allowed... "in which the European Bank of Credit will make its decision... "with regard to the money in question. "By the end of this grace period, you will receive all the information necessary... "concerning the manner in which the money is to be handed over to us... "and how your son will be returned to you. "Should the bank refuse to pay the ransom... "you would not have the slightest hope of seeing your boy again. "The bank would thus be solely responsible... "for the death of your son. "No police investigation is to be undertaken... "during this period of 24 hours. "Otherwise we will have no choice... "but to put the boy to death." Naturally there's no signature. And if you hadn't noticed, the letter was composed on an office labeler. I believe it's called a Demo. Gentleman, let's get down to work. You must be aware that we can't afford to leave this room... until we've made our decision. Since time is short, we have to act fast. Mr. President, surely you can't be serious. Do you know of any bank that would give in to such blackmail? I'm absolutely opposed to it. A child's life hangs in the balance. If we were to give in to their demands, we would set a dangerous precedent. Before long, no one would be safe. Up till now, these kidnappings, these abductions... have plagued only the children of the rich. Soon they'll be kidnapping anybody. May I call your attention to just one passage of this letter? "Should the bank refuse to pay the ransom... "you would not have the slightest hope of seeing your boy again. "The bank would thus be solely responsible... "for the death of your son." The bank. The stockholders will meet at the end of the month. Why don't we put the question to a vote? Mr. Alexandre, the stockholder's meeting is in two weeks. The ransom has to be paid today. Tonight. Jacques, you are jeopardizing your position. It's not my position which is in jeopardy. It's the bank's reputation. I'd be curious to see your face tomorrow. What if they don't pay? Do you have a bank account? Yeah, First National. Imagine the First National in the same situation. The bank won't pay. The boy is killed. What do you do? Change banks. They won't like it if you change banks. Our problem is 50 million French people, and not merely one kidnapper. Come in. And among these 50 million French people are our own customers. - The afternoon paper, sir. - Thank you. I'd say that the afternoon paper has put the problem very clearly. "The European Bank of Credit in the face of public opinion." "Daniel's father earns "Ransom of 5 million old francs demanded." "The life of a child in the hands of a bank." And as the secretary's trying to deal with the mountain of telegrams... and a hopelessly snarled switchboard. The board of directors met in closed sessions... to decide what course of action to take. Neither the president of the European Bank of Credit... nor his board members needed reminder of the furor their customers would cause... by the mass withdrawal of their deposits if the ransom of little Daniel was not paid. The bank's president personally broke the news... of the board's decision to us just a few moments ago. In a voice choked with emotion, he announced... that in a spontaneous and humanitarian gesture... the bank would meet the $1 million demand. He declined to elaborate further... and concluded the interview with these words: "It is our sincere hope that Daniel be returned to his family." And it is our hope to have good news... of his safe return on our 11:00 broadcast. - Go into the caf and ask for... - That one there? Yes. Ask for two orange sodas. No, two cherry sodas. Two cherry sodas. One for you and one for the dog. Ask for two straws. Your father and mother will come for you. When will they come? They're gonna come right away. But I won't have time to give him a drink. Sure, you'll have time to give him a drink. Don't worry. - Goodbye. - Goodbye, Uncle Simca. - Be good. - Bye. So long, little Simca. Don't forget now... when his nose is warm, it means he's sick. You'll have to watch out for him. - But if his nose is cold... - You can call anytime. Tell your mom and dad they can bring you whenever you like. Hello, yes? A little boy just walked into your caf. Do you see him? Yes. The boy's name is Daniel Gallois. He's the one they've been looking for. Give him a hot chocolate and some cookies... then phone the boy's parents... at Longchamp 45-85. Hello? What's your name, son? Daniel Gallois. Away, away, sailor Good evening. How is Daniel? Happy as he can be. He's all right. It's been the most fabulous Christmas he ever had. Why have you kept me waiting? Well, you see, I was held up... by the caf owners, the reporters, and the police. What were the police after? Nothing to worry about. A description of the car. I gave them the license number, as you told me to. Okay. Where's the money? It's on ice. What about mine? Yours is on ice, too. But we agreed I was to get my share tonight. I changed my mind. Why? Tomorrow they'll print the numbers of all the bills in the newspapers. It would be suicide to use that money for at least six months. In a little while, you'll quit the bank... because of your health, your heart. You'll quietly slip out of the country. Only then will you get your money. What proof do I have that you're not lying? None. But you might give me a little advance. You've been broke for 40 years. You can wait another six months. Really? I already told you, it's on ice. But that's not what we agreed. What we're agreeing to right now is that you'll get your money in six months. Forget it. That wasn't what we agreed upon. What we did agree to was that your wife would be in on it. What difference does it make if my wife was in on it or not? A big difference. Get lost, Gallois. Fast. Did everything work out? Yes. He was too jumpy. I thought I'd better scare him a little. I hope I didn't scare him too much. - Is there any beer? - Yes. No, don't get up, I'll get it. What are you doing? I'm checking that you hid it properly. You know, I have some good news. - Taking up cooking? - Jerk. Is it good news for you or for me? For both of us. Is it me who'll have to play Santa Claus next Christmas? Why didn't you tell me before? Are you happy? Very. Really! "The European Bank of Credit pays ransom and saves child. "Daniel is back home again. "Little Daniel saved, France salutes the European Bank of Credit." Gentlemen, thanks to you, what could have been a big tragedy... has turned out to have a happy ending. We thank you, gentlemen. We're all grateful to you. Moreover, the news we've received from all our offices is excellent. It seems that hundreds of prospective customers... have turned up at our teller windows to show their gratitude. Consequently, we might say that the generous gesture... which you have made is very likely to be richly rewarded. Now, gentlemen, we've arranged to have you meet someone who's here... and who would like to say a few words to you. Mr. Gallois? Come right in. I would like you to meet Charles Gallois... the happy father who has something to say to us, I believe. Gentlemen... I would like, on behalf of my wife... and my own, of course... to express my deep appreciation... our most heartfelt gratitude and appreciation... for the generous gesture which you have made... and for saving our son's life. Thank you for what you have done. No need to thank us. It was only natural. We never even hesitated. Now, since the best things in life always come in twos... we're giving you a promotion. You have been transferred to our investment division. Thank you. Thank you, sir. Thank you. Congratulations, Gallois. Miss, will you show the reporters in, please? - Delighted for you. - Thank you very much. - Thank you. - Hold it there. That's it. Mr. Gallois, would you mind standing with the board of directors? - Where should I stand? - Over there. We'd like to have you with the president... and the members of the board. Over here? That's fine. This must be the happiest day of your life. Yes, it is. These gentlemen are members of the board, sir? That's right, and Mr. Gallois has just expressed his gratitude... for the gesture made by the bank. Our listeners would be interested in you repeating that, sir. Repeating what? Your statement to the board, for our radio listeners. So we can broadcast it. Gentlemen, I would like... Would you speak a little louder? On behalf of myself and my wife... I'd like to express my deepest appreciation... to the directors of the European Bank of Credit... for the generous... very generous gesture which... which you made... and for saving our son's life. And my thanks. Simon Duroc, known as Simon the Swiss. Hello? Come in here, will you? I have some information that will amuse you. Sit down. Guess what? Someone seems to think Simon the Swiss is our man. - Who? - Anonymous. Bill? I never knew Bill to be anonymous. Go look up our friend Simon. - Do you still need me? - No, thanks. What happened? - They arrested Simon. - Shit. I'll be right back. - How did they find out? - Somebody squealed. - Who? - Don't know yet. You're crazy to keep the money at your place. The cops would never look there. They would never think of it. Why were they looking for it at your place? Don't ask me. They come around every night. SAUNA - GENTLEMEN Got your house keys? May I have my keys? Thanks. Lock up for me tonight, will you? Come on, move. Shit. There he goes! I'll head him off! Okay, get out. Get out, or I'll kill you. He's crazy! Son of a bitch! Police! Stop him! This cab free? Sure, if you know how to drive. Are you hurt? All right. Any description? A man and a woman? Tell me, Swiss. What about your accomplices? You know I'm in the habit of operating alone. If there was any money hidden in your place... somebody pinched it. You just can't rely on the police for protection. KILLED IN THE LINE OF DUTY How old is your "killed in the line of duty" list? It's been a while. I must admit, you're in a dangerous line of work. Thanks to you. You want a beer? Have you added a bar? No foam! They'll be here in 10 minutes. Ten minutes, Swiss. I know. He just said that. So you have no accomplices... and, of course, you have an alibi. Yes, of course. - Would you like to hear what it is? - Please. I spent the evening at home with my fiance. If the boy recognizes you, you'll sleep here. If not, you'll be free to sleep with your fiance. They're here. Hi, Uncle Simca! Bastard! - Do you recognize him, madam? - Yes. - And you, sir? - Yes. Would you wait in the next room, please? Uncle Simca. And my fiance? No, not tonight. Where is the money? My place. Where in your place? Would you believe, the kitchen? Under the fridge? Under the fridge. You cops are so smart, you know everything. Where the motor should be. - Is that right? - Yes. Not anymore, it isn't. Not anymore? What can you expect when you're not protected? Remember the phone call I had earlier? I was told that a man had just jumped out of your kitchen window with the money. And you were too late to stop him, of course. That's right. Could he have been your accomplice? Why not the guy who turned me in? What do you have to do with all this? Hello? Would you be good enough to read this to me over the phone? "Hello, Longchamp 45-85? "Please stand by, we are broadcasting live on Europe Number One. "You and your child are to hurry over to the Olympia Music Hall in Paris." Go on. "You've won an exciting prize on our radio lottery on Europe Number One. "Take a taxi and come as quickly as possible to the Olympia." It can't be her. Go on. "Say, 'Thank you, Simca."' Do you suppose you could ask the woman to repeat it... a little bit louder? And make it sound more like a real radio contest. Would you read the text again with a bit more conviction? Pretend you're a radio announcer. "Hello, Longchamp 45-85? "Please stand by, we are broadcasting live on Europe Number One. "You and... "You and your child are to hurry over to the Olympia Music Hall in Paris." "You've won an exciting prize on our radio lottery on Europe Number One. "Take a taxi and come as quickly as possible to the Olympia." "Say, 'Thank you, Simca."' No. "Say, 'Thank you, Simca!"' - No, I'm sure it wasn't that voice. - No. Sir, madam... have you ever seen this woman before? No. Have you? No. How about you, young fella? When you were in that house with Uncle Simca? - Do you remember? - Yes. Was this lady with you? No, it was Santa Claus. - Ask the boy to tell you his name. - Daniel. - What's your name? - Daniel. Did Santa Claus have a voice like that? No. Why not? Because he had a long white beard. - You mean Santa couldn't talk? - No. He had a long white beard. I want you to look at this lady. You've never seen her? No, never. Twenty years. Okay, Aldo, let's see if you have any class. Not class. Style. How do you do? I'm the mayor. - I will be officiating the ceremony. - Thank you. No Italian. We're waiting for the witnesses. As soon as they arrive, we'll proceed with the civil ceremony. Do you have the rings, miss? You shouldn't put them on before. It brings bad luck. Simon, they're ready. After serving five years in the penitentiary... in relative seclusion... Simon the Swiss seems suddenly to want to return to our consumer society... and to see his name in the headlines once again. Afternoon. With style, huh? Not style. With class. - Miss. Mr. Mayor. - Good day, sir. Maria, Simon. - No Italian. - I'm sorry, I forgot. Would you tell the warden that we're ready to start the ceremony? WARDEN Come in. - Warden, they're ready. - I'm coming. - How are you? - Fine, and you? We should get going, now that everyone's here. - How's your wife? - Fine. - Feeling better? - Yes, thanks. First, I'd like to ask the best man to stand over here... on my right, as is customary. Right next to the warden. You are the best man, I believe? Yes, Mr. Mayor. "Article 212: Man and wife must render unto each other... "fidelity, succor, and assistance. "Article 213: The husband shall be head of the family. "He is responsible for the mutual welfare and well-being of the home and children. "Article 215: The family's place of residence... "shall be determined by the husband. "The wife shall be obliged to live with him, and he shall be obliged to support her." Do you, Mr. Aldo Ferrari, take as your lawfully wedded wife... Miss Maria Castillo, here present? Yes. Do you, Miss Maria Castillo, take as your lawfully wedded husband... Mr. Aldo Ferrari, here present? Then, in accordance with the law of the land... you are hereby united in marriage. Finally, I must ask you to sign the registry, if you would. Thank you very much. And now you, sir. Below, there. Sign here. Very good. Thank you very much. Let me read it to you. On the sixth day of May, 1970, at 3:30 p. M... in the presence of... Make the slightest move and I shoot! All of you, stand over there. I said, stand over there! Aldo! Maria, the door! Tell them to open the door, Warden. I'll count up to three. One, two... Open it. Now, get going. After you, Warden. One, two... Move! - Anything I can do for you, Warden? - No, nothing. Come on. Quickly. Let's go. Simon the Swiss is back in the news again. He has staged a sensational jailbreak... taking as a hostage the warden of the prison himself. The daring escape was carried out with the help... of fellow inmate Aldo Ferrari... who was convicted on a charge of armed robbery three years ago. Naturally, during our next news bulletin, at 6:00 p. M... we will keep you informed... of further developments in the situation as they occur. Thank you, and please stay tuned for our 6:00 bulletin. Tickets, money, instructions, all in the pot. - Is our marriage valid? - Come on! - Then why did you send for me? - Why do you think? He engineered this, he's the brain. Okay, it's valid, get in. It's 6:00, and now for the news. The spectacular escape of Simon the Swiss... is now reluctantly acknowledged by police to have succeeded. All attempts to track them down have failed. Although the area has been sealed off... there has been no sign of either of the two convicts. They seem to have vanished into thin air. However, their hostage has materialized. The warden was picked up safe and sound, though visibly shaken... on a country road, where he was trying to hitchhike back to town. Is it usually on time? It was on time for four days straight. Why would you dress up like that? Sporty. The arrest warrant issued for Simon the Swiss... therefore officially confirms his escape from prison. Ports, airports, highways, and railway stations are now under surveillance... and it appears impossible that Simon the Swiss... will be able to escape police. Oddly enough, prison authorities rated Simon a model prisoner. He was even being considered for parole at the time of his breakout. Evidently, he felt the wheels of justice were turning too slowly... and took matters into his own hands. Originally sentenced to 20 years for the kidnapping of Daniel Gallois... Simon Duroc, alias Simon the Swiss... was the only member of the gang ever apprehended. The identity of his accomplices was never discovered. However, the police are confident that his daring escape... will eventually lead them to the arrest of the entire gang. Far from being disheartened... it seems law enforcement officials are in high spirits. At 6:35 p.m., just moments ago, we received word... that Simon the Swiss was spotted at Montparnasse station... getting off a train which had just pulled in. He managed to shake off his pursuers... who chased him into the streets. They lost him in a crowd just outside two movie theaters. He is believed to have slipped into one of them. If so, Simon the Swiss has an ironic choice of films: The Confession and The Gangster. Simon would be true to form if he were to have chosen The Gangster... the new musical based on the high jinks of a small-time gangster. I hope he saw The Confession, but I am being partial. And to capture Simon the Swiss... police must follow better clues than my own personal taste in movies. Orchestra. THE GANGSTER - ORCHESTRA - BALCONY Thank you. All the evil I'm doing Police. Has anyone out of breath come in in a hurry? - Wearing a dark coat? - We better have a look. This way, please. Though my people destroy me My fame will grow The world will know Of Le Voyou What's the problem? No problem. What time is it? Tell me, Charlie. You're sure about the place? Quiet. Isolated. Just great. Your toothbrush is to the right of the sink. - Did you sleep well? - Very well. - Want some coffee? - Yes. Charles, tea or coffee? Tea. - Lemon? - Please. What are you doing here? I sure was glad when I heard you escaped. I figured I'd get my share of the money. Funny, you didn't sound glad a minute ago. Yeah, not at all. That's because I didn't expect this. Where are we going? This is as far as we go. Well, what are you going to do? We thought we'd have some fun. Flip a coin. If it's heads, I'll pull the trigger. If it's tails, he will. And if it lands on the edge, we'll let you go. - Oh? And why is that? - Like I said, just to have some fun. Better luck next time. It's stupid to kill him. He's already dead. If he's already dead, we ought to publish his memoirs. Sit down. Sit down, Gallois. Do you know how to write? I'll dictate. "I, the undersigned... "Charles Gallois... "head of the investment division... "of the European Bank of Credit... "hereby declare that I alone was the instigator... "of the kidnapping of my son..." Write, Gallois. "...that I alone was the instigator of the kidnapping of my own son... "perpetrated on May 22, 1965, in Paris..." You're going too fast. It's too fast. "...that I alone was the instigator of the kidnapping of my own son... "perpetrated on May 22, 1965, in Paris... "and for which... "Simon Duroc, alias the Swiss... "was unjustly imprisoned." Underline the word "unjustly." Good, yeah, great. "The idea was mine... "and mine alone..." "...mine and mine alone... "to kidnap my son in order to obtain... "from the bank where I'm employed..." I said write! Write, Gallois, and write fast. "The idea was mine and mine alone... "to kidnap my son... "in order to obtain from the bank where I am employed... "the sum of $1 million." Period. New paragraph. "I swear... "to have acted... "without the knowledge of my wife... "and furthermore... "that this letter... "was written under no threat whatsoever." No. Write it, I say! Because, in any case, I didn't have a chance. No matter how the coin landed, I'd be killed. Well, it's obvious. They made it obvious. - They did? - It was damn clear. - By tossing... - Right, I'd be killed. Right, if it was head, tails, no matter how. When I saw they weren't joking, I knew I was screwed. Given the circumstance, I understand. - That's right. - Go on. - I'm sorry. - That's all right. As soon as the guy flipped it... the other one took his revolver out... because the Swiss already had a revolver. I tried to escape, but there was no way out, and the wall behind me. They used blanks, or they missed, but I'm here. So they must have used blanks. Blank cartridges, that is. Right, they're called blanks. You're well acquainted with ballistic terms. - No, but I've heard the word. - Then? They aimed and fired, but I didn't know they weren't real bullets. Of course not. The worst was not knowing what would happen to me. I kept wondering if it was a dream. And they made me sit down, because I was at the end of my rope. - Because they'd cornered you. - Because they'd cornered me. You were frightened. Yes, I was frightened, scared to death. What sort of things did they ask you? They didn't ask me anything. - No questions? - Not one single question. - Did you ask them anything? - I asked them to tell me why. Why what? "Just tell me why," I said. - And they answered... - They wouldn't say. And after, they made you sit down. That's right. I was sitting at the table and writing. You see, they made me write. That's why I'm here, so you would know. That I was forced. Because of what I wrote. You must have the letter. It was supposed to come special delivery. You should have received it by now. If you didn't, you will any minute. From you? From me, but they forced me to write it. They told me what to write. I wrote what they said. Can you remember what you wrote? Very well. They made me say that I planned the whole thing. You were the one? I planned the whole thing. The Swiss, innocent. Mr. Gallois, you're behaving very strangely. I'm sorry, I'm a bit upset. - Perhaps it's a defense mechanism. - Perhaps. Inspector, may I see you for a minute, please? No, not right now, I'm busy. That must be it, the special delivery. It's the special delivery. I'll be right there. Excuse me, I won't be long. You'll see that I was telling you the truth. Relax, I'll be right back. Yes, sir. Well, Mr. Gallois, it was a special delivery letter. Is that it? Yes, that's it. Of course, it doesn't mean anything. It was obviously written under threat. After all, Mr. Gallois, surely we have more confidence... in the word of a man who works in a bank... than the word of a man who holds up banks. Go home, give little Daniel a big kiss, and forget it. Here. Better yet. There. Over with. What's over with? It's over with. It can't be. These guys are still on the loose. - But you're with us. - What about me? But you're with us. We've been warned. Even if you've been warned... They'll never try to pull the same thing twice. We know them. - You can relax. - How about having a drink? Beer, a Coke? A Coke it is. - Would you like a drink? - No, not now, thanks. There you are, Mr. Gallois. - You're sure? - Yes. To your health. Do you like music? It depends on what. Where's the money? It's on ice. What about mine? Your share's on ice, too. But we agreed I was to get my share tonight. I changed my mind. They never gave me a cent. Not a cent. They kept it all. DEVELOPMENTS IN THE GALLOIS CASE Daniel's father confesses: "I kidnapped my own son." We are scheduled to land at New York's Kennedy Airport... at 6:00 p.m. Local time. Excuse me, sir. What did you tell Martine? I told her I was going to Montreal. And the cook? Let's see, what did I tell the cook? Excuse me, gentlemen, would you like something to drink? Yes, a beer. - And you sir? - Champagne. I told her Montreal, too. No foam on it, please. Not smart. Ladies and gentlemen, we'd like to present tonight's in-flight film. Excuse me, sir. Pity, I saw it. How was it? When I saw it, I had a lot on my mind. All the evil I'm doing Will lead me to my ruin Wait and see Ladies and gentlemen, this is your captain speaking. We're moving into a heavy fog bank... which has moved in over New York and the entire Eastern Seaboard. We'll be landing instead in Montreal.
