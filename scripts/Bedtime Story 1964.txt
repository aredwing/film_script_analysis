Let me live a little of them. Have they give us money. This is likely to shock a man like you, does not it? 's pretty revolutionary thought. But how to implement these changes? This is your brain washed it's pathetic. Well, it's time to eat. You probably think I paid a meal? - of course. Come with me. And what do you see? - People eat. You know what I see? - What? Three free meals. I just have to choose. Sit there and look at me. Ooops ma'am, can I sit here? If you want to. - Thank you.

But if you settle a top ballerina, it's worth. To the man who created this beautiful tapestry was not under the auspices of a rich plemia , the work of art would not exist today. Do you see what I mean, Freddy, Money itself is worthless. It should be used in a proper purpose. Look, Daddy. Want to play Robin Hood? OK. But not on my account. For some archaeologists would not dig, and it is Freddijev money. I will because I now spend it. And because we have delivered it, liberated taxes. My grandmother always said: Do not bet on surprises If you do not want to be a loser. Something you forget: I have now I am leading the operation. I did not know that so we're gonna rob.

Oh, Freddy, that traumatic experience. Do not you be a military psychiatrist help? Trude they are. Make the best you can, but I just do not react. Surely someone can help! So there is one man. The famous Swiss psychiatrist. Specialist for such cases. Who is he? Dr. Emil Schuffhausen. Takes known Schuffhausen clinic in Lucerne. Why not go with him? I wrote to him for months, but impossible to get a date with him. Why? A man like Dr. Schuffhausen is sought all over the world. It may require astronomical sums. Why should we bother with the poor soldier like me. What do you mean by astronomical? I heard it gets per $ 25000 per case. Where does my $ 25000? impossible. Nothing is impossible, Freddy. It is beautiful here. I am really pleased that we are in the same hotel. And to me. Come on tomorrow overflow bit in the sun. Oh, no. You're there to have fun. Do not waste time brinui for me.
