My mom did not want, she was afraid to be electrocuted in his sleep. She died very old and a little senile, I'm afraid. You did not get cold tonight? It would be nice if I had another one for you. Would you like that? I can find one if you want. I ask to Mrs. Parnell. It will not mind. It comes tomorrow. Mrs. Parnell. Do you understand? It comes tomorrow Thursday.

We'll be there for your party bridge. No, I think it has changed. The location or date home or at home, I do not know. My God... I'm not dressed. Excuse me, I have to get dressed if you let it. I scare you? I scared you. You know what I did? I played Dr. Colin... buff! Blind Man's Bluff. You know to play it? I played at school. You know what it is? I found. You have three chances. A... Not.

Fill out this form. At the next stop, we will give you a map. What contraceptive will you ask him? Rather the pill. I've heard stories the thing that you put into it. Yes, the IUD. It is said that some women give birth to a beautiful baby after wearing one but I will not take any risks. The pill that makes you fat. It's true, I took five pounds. What will you ask? I am hoping to do the pill. You listen to the heart and it takes your blood? It examines you entirely. Really? Always. It's nothing. This is your first time? That's why I was hoping... Me, it does distress me at all. I am even more nervous the second time. Me, it's been I'm not doing more. But how do you have children? I would not be nervous if I had, but I'm not married. I see. No, it's fine. If women were all here before making nonsense, it would be so much simpler. I really know nothing about it. My mother never spoke. I tried several things. The diaphragm does not work. As condom... The men forget in the excitement. I had two children, despite that. Anyway, I am here for the pill. It seems that in each box, there is a hole. This is sadism! You are married for a long time? I first started with the IUD but my husband felt. Some men... are better equipped? We will say that. I thought that's pretty much it was the same. No, they are all different, like us. Note, is asked if a diaphragm he must either R the right size. The diaphragm is used See you instead of the pill. I'd rather the pill. Your umbrella. The Pill it is probably easier. Yes, but sometimes larger. You ready r Act 5 pounds? Miss Austin. Miss Austin. It's down the hall. The diaphragm it spoils the fun. It has to go do his business while the man waits. Enter. Sit. Your card, please. Thank you. Let's see. Miss Austin, right? Yes. Single? Yes, I'm getting married. Perfect. Have you ever been pregnant? Not. It simplifies things. Dr. McKenzie will examine you. It is very good. Come with me. It was not really bad. Look, here it is. Take off your clothes and put on this. The doctor arrives immediately. What the hell are you doing here? Where is she? - What are you doing here? Let me enter. It is where the veteran? Nicky is at work. This is your peeps? Not bad. Nina, you'll make me have problems. What is this? Put it down, will you? She'll be back. Frances, you're late. I called. I'm sorry. Nobody answered. - I was out. It is very humid. There you are! - I'll be right there. Good evening! You made us worry. Frances, you're late. I know. You do not play, my uncle? - My arm hurts. Do not you go take a bath? Do not do it, it will not delay. I'll take a bath, let me go. But she will soon return! You've taken one. - She asked me. I take one too. You'll be in trouble. - I'm sure she'll say anything. I'm your sister, right? - Stop, that's enough. It is not as if I took a bath every day. I have no bath. There is one for parents. You can talk. I'm there more often than you. At least she has it all. Not touch, she will notice it. She'll say it's you. Hurry up, will ya? She has great stuff. I do not know when she comes. Hurry up. I'll take my time. Relax. I have told you, I do not take a bath every day. Brat who would deprive his sister a bath. Give me... Give me a towel, quick! Behind you. I use it, Give me another one, quick! My mascara runs. Help me. My lashes are the trunk. I have my pants. It will not, right? Okay, enough, you win! This is Nicky who should be here. You'll see! Not. We need stops, she will notice it. Remember my plastic boat? It was a duck. The duck was yours. Me, it was a boat, a submarine. It is well done! What tone! This is not your day. It's too cold. It will warm you. It's gonna rain. - I do not think so. Will it last long? Another hour. I would like Nicky is here. He's not here. Anyone but you. Except my brother. Damage. Now get dressed. Imagine if I was not your sister. What does that mean? I turn you on? If you went with the parents? It's been a while, right? Come on. Approach. For what? I... I am a little stiff neck. Nina, you're completely barge. I get excited because you're afraid of me. But this is not true! Where it hurts? Sit. Gently. Above. Above. Continue. Kitten? What? You have a poop eye. Fuck! It was not worth it. - Forget it. I feel woozy. I probably caught cold tonight. I'll give you something. This is probably fatigue. I try to have a discussion with you. I would, but it's late. It is 21:30. You brandy? Yes, use. Thank you. Lying to me. Certainly. Migraine? No, it's okay. I do not have a migraine. It will if you do not you relax. I'm tired. Frances. We know long. Can I afford a comment some deem moved? I never mentioned your privacy. Our friendship and I considre as sincere, Blows has made the surface. What I mean is that... It is not a whim but a deliberate thing. I'm sure sometimes you need to be loved. Bend your knees and get a little. Now put your feet in stirrups. Perfect. down a little more. Everything okay? Are you sure? Yes, I had an exhausting day. Frances, people trust See you often their doctor. They forget one thing. A doctor also has its problems. Loneliness is. I am alone, like many others. I need someone. Charles, I think that's enough. Sorry, I... - I'm sorry. You told me maybe misunderstood. When I spoke of love... I did not mean... I wanted to talk... tenderness, understanding, but no... You do not believe me so presumptuous. I do not want to offend you. Maybe with time... Charles will. This must be my fault. I withdraw. Can I call you tomorrow? Sleep well. You sleep? I do not. I had a tough day. I'm too tired to sleep. But most importantly, it makes me feel weird to have you home. I used to be alone. I wonder... You must think I'm all alone... I am, it is true, but I do not think about it. My mother was always saying she was lonely after the death of my father. She kept repeating. As if I was not for her no company. But it was old and senile... I do not think about it. Old people disgust me with their feelings. You think I'm old? I was wondering... You know... I have a friend. He is a doctor. And he wants all the time make love to me. All the time. It does not please me at all. But he still wants me. I hate him to touch me. Looks like an old man. He feels old. I've known... ten years. That has never changed. It is always the same. It is always impeccable. His shirts, shoes. I remember your shoes the day of your arrival. You wear them without laces. Without socks either. I had never seen someone without socks. It gave me something. His shoes are classy about him. Shined. Rather small. When he sits, we see her garters. Always he pulls his pants at the knees. You know what I mean? I think he needs me but I've never felt for him. I'm to be alone, it disgusts me. I would like to know if you really sleep. You're very strong if you pretend. Do you mind if I lie? I stay on the covers. I lie, that's all. There like that. I also wanted to tell you... If you want to love me, I'm fine. I want you to make love to me. Please. "This product is intended lovers of pleasure. "Syrupy and sensual, "It penetrates the skin during the massage..." It makes you laugh to read that? Right? - "In a 100 ml bottle." What it meant, "It's not like you?" Wait... What? Be more specific. See you later, you said "It is not like you." What does that mean? Okay, it's different. But at that hand? Its about sex is very strange. It actually a big deal. I should go see and spend time with her. Instead of squatting here? Squatter? Thanks to me, you r comic eye. He still has not eaten. - What's the difference? There will be entitled like everyone else. We're not at war. - You're disgusting. You're disgusting. Apologize auprs Nicky. Apologize. Apologize. He even lost his tongue. Where are you going? You have not even eaten. Leave him alone. Come on, let him. It is always the same. I'm tired of your bickering. You slept late. I run a bath. I can leave here whenever I want. Even if you remember me, I do not sleep with you. If I want a girl, I can get out to find one. And I will not. I'm sorry. Really. I do not want you to be angry. I want you to stay here. I want nothing changes. Can you understand that? I will not let you leave. Not now. Forgiveness. It's cute, it. She looks like my sister. Your sister? - I swear. You have a sister, do you? I'm serious. That's it. They chope where this time? It was behind the Plaza. 80 stitches. The last time, she stayed three weeks. It's like that. Believe me, this time it is finished. No job, she'll do what? Danny cares. 80 stitches... It is ruined. Sorry... Sorry, you have the time? No, I do not have my watch. It must be eleven. You have the blush? What? The blush, the eye See you cheeks. No, sorry, I do not have. Are you alone? You do not expect anyone? No, why? I have a friend, a young man... He can not leave my and I was wondering... What? He feels very alone. If you come with me... You will pay me? Sure, I'll pay you. You are inflated do. Really swollen. You followed me? You know, I may be the hustler but I do not girls. Leave me alone. Find yourself someone and let me go. You know what? There is a girl out there, an inverted. An inverted? One would almost mistake. She offered you the money? It must be your sister. I would not care less price. Have a drink. You should have said yes. Forget it, everyone cares. Try the Pink Swan. This is perfect for lesbians! She needs help. You're going where? Where is he? What idiot! Mrs.... Wait. I can help you. I think not, thank you. You want some company? - No, thank you. I know the neighborhood, I can help you. You need to find strange I ask that. To me, nothing is weird. I have a friend, a boy, who lives in me. He can not leave him even then he sent me. What is the budget? I do not know, we have not spoken. What you propose, I think so. It is a bit difficult. To be quiet, count 30 r 35 dollars. It suits him perfectly I am sure. I know some addresses let's go. You're not going to yell at me? And why not? You've been out all night, See you back you're 5h. You expect? Stay here, I'll take care of everything. I'm Murph. - What's this for? He would need someone. Your sister has the phone? So why have not you called me? That's all I ask. What's your thing? - Excuse me? It must be nice. You pay how much? The man said 30 or 35 dollars. $ 50, no less. We want to see first. Frank, get Sylvia. Al gives a cafe See you little lady. There will be no better. You say that for 3 years. Madam, can I offer you the word of the Lord? Read this. You, sir. Read His word and qu'll bless you. Ladies, can I offer you this brochure? The word of the Lord is revealed. You can find salvation if you read this! Go and fuck yourself. You do not send Fuck the Lord. Shut up and fuck! God bless you and forgive you. Here. That's ma'am. It is not for me. Where? - At her home. You have to pay now. Forgiveness. Say, ma'am. You have not set the coffee. 15 cents. I can choose where we're going? We're going home? Come, follow me. Please. I have your name? Sylvia. Here is the guy I was talking about. She locked us? Yes, it is a mania with her. I'm here for her or for you? She paid you? Yes. How? $ 20. She is generous. I say that to me. So she likes to watch? It will look the keyhole? You watch us? No, it's... It's just a little hit. I do not like too much stuff crossed. But you have me look good. Go slowly, okay? Take off your sweater. Wait a minute. Wait I'll close the bathroom. Wait just a second. You're sure she will not pay earlier? What's wrong? If everything goes well. Stop thinking. You're not focused. You are obliged to speak? It's that woman? She upset you. What are you doing here with her? For starters, she was locked up. She holds you by force? If you want to discuss, so get dressed, right? She will not like it, Sylvia? Wait. Do not worry, as soon as I get out of here, you come with me. You want to go with Sylvia? You wanna come with me? I do not know. We'll see, right?

I told her "You do not please her "And you should leave." Fear not, I beg you. You'll stay with me, Do not be afraid. You'll stay with me, Do not be afraid. You're staying with me. I want you make love to me. I beg you. Stay with me. Make love to me.
