When someone is desperate, at the end of the rope... Yes, I mean suicidal... He has to try everything before giving up, right? At the end of the rope... ...imagine! If anyone had told me two years ago that I, Basletti, first superintendent of the Innocenti, would find myself in such a situation... ...I mean, that I would have ended up like this! Well, I would have laughed! Yes, because two years ago... my life, the world, Vincenzina, I... were all completely different! Last october 19th, Giulio Basletti and Vincenzina Rotunno were joined in matrimony, thus ending a beautiful and delicate love fairy tale that had started 16 years earlier. A ready smile, a dynamic disposition, Giulio Basletti doesn't show he is 51 years old. In 1956 his factory sent him to Monte Cagnano in the province of Avellino for the installation of new facilities. In that smiley little town, Basletti... ...Smiley! I've never seen anyone smiling in Monte Cagnano! Basletti finds accomodations with a simple and straightforward familiy. When their beautiful baby girl is born they ask him to be her Godfather. In the church of San Salvatore di Alise he held the fragile little creature in his arms for the first time. Wanna bet Vincenzina is going to pee on Giulios coat! She peed in your coat! A little later Giulio Basletti would leave Monte Cagnano, but at every baptismal anniversary he would send the girl a postcard from the many places around the world his job took him Many places around the world! I might have sent some postcards from Tarvisio, Ponte Tresa... Switzerland, OK, but... Hear this... the factory sends Basletti to Monte Cagnano to review the plant damaged by an earthquake. It was a stupendous spring day The swallows weaved arabesques in the blue sky when Giulio saw a radiant young girl running towards him. "Giulio!" She said breathless and happy, "Who are you?", asked Giulio definitely amazed, "Your daughter Vincenzina" she answered! Yes! That palpitating young girl with natural curled hair was the little pink wad Giulio once held at the baptism. Vincenzina held the hand of the man whose memory she had always cultivated in a love swell and lead him to the Immaculate's fountain... "C'mon!" Where the water sprang amidst the ivy She offered him a sip from her hand saying: "Giulio, as you watered me at the baptismal sink" Listen to what they are writing! It didn't happen this way! It's not true. It's not true you have thought about him all this years? Yes, that's true but... But, I didn't return to Monte Cagnano, so... the prairy meeting is bullshit! It's the usual massification of the bourgeoise press! Yes, the events all took place here in Milan That night I had just finished my shift So, I was leaving... and who do I meet? Vincenzina's dad and her two brothers: Peppino and Antonio They had come up north for labor I was caught by surprise! Who could have expected them! Above all I didn't expect her... Who is that? What do you mean, who? I'm Vincenzina! No... you're so old! Heard that... I really said: "you're so old!" Six months later... or exactly six months and three days later... we were husband and wife! And people said to me: "she's so young!" Since some of my stuff was left there at the old Pied--terre First thing was to fetch it. Bice, how are you Hey... Hi Giulio, you've arrived Congratulations is this the bride? Here she is Nice to meet you wow, she is young and beautiful Hey, Basletti!

Well, this little room has seen a bit... I am not to boast Not only here, all your life... Well, calculating is not so easy, you know... So, lets see... say every two or three days for 32 year... well... it's 120 per year Well... give or take, lets say: And what if I had made love Gosh! At your age? What would you tell me?

But with the worker's Unity! Got it? Milan! Milan! Why are you stopping? They might have scored already... Fill the bottle with 10 coffees... and get me a pack of cigarettes from that bar. Stop! Stop this frame! Here it is! The precise moment where I gave way to my own ruin! Let's watch it please. Start the moviola... Notice my condescending manners whilst giving the order! Pay attention...

Just like uncle Pasquale... He died of chasm last november! No. That was Grandpa Arturo! What are you talking about? Grandpa Arturo died of cholera! Such happy chats back in the country! You who live in Milan... Why don't you ask the government for aid? Government already aided the link! Have you seen the link? What link? The link-road, a bold engineering feat! It links Putigliano-Salentino to Marciano-del-Monte! A brilliant 4 lane road... It extends for 30.82 miles... overall cost: 86 billion! Now you can proudly reach Marciano in 22 min. But if you have a Ferrari or Maserati, 16 min. Why would anyone go to Marciano-del-monte? For shit! Nobody ever goes... Here we are. Armando works here. Remember him? Sure... He got it sponsored by the mayor, the bishop, 5 inspectors... He has 2 bachelors... and he is studying for the 3rd! Armando! Hi! How are you? Nice surprise! He looks so nice in uniform! Move it! Why? Is it dangerous? Well... only an ambulance went by in the last 10 days. Anyways... I didn't expect you. How nice! But... is this Giulio? Giulio! How are you? We went through the link. So we thought "let's visit Armando" How nice! How is Vincenzina? Well! I'll show you The last scoop What do you think? She grew pretty... Wonderfull! What about me? I look like OK Corral's Sheriff! Great shooter! By all means! Who's this? Who? A Friend... So young? Please observe the Sheriff looks transfigured into a festival announcer! Hey Giu! Whazzup? What? Milan! Milan is up! Traitors!

What were you up to while I was away? Nothing... you tell me! How is Momma and my brothers? They are fine... the country is bad, but... You did well not to come... Let's talk about you... did you feel lonely? A little... but now I have a young lad to keep me company! Isn't it Ciccio? Oh! Ciccio! Salvatore Armetta looked for you. Who? Salvatore, very urgent he said! Oh bloody damn... And our friends, how are they? And Giovanni? Oh, he greets you. He's been transferred. Really? Where? I don't know... Novara, Biella... Whose apples are these? C'mon I'm busy! C'mon we have to make up for lost time! Otherwise our average suffers... I brought you a present. C'mon, a quicky... Sure! Someone had to pester! Coming! Santo! Can you come out for a moment? Yes Be back soon, ok? Come in. What damn... Hi Giulio. Hi Armetta. Vincenzina told me you wanted to talk... They already know about it. Well, tell me... My little Sultina... with that hellzhost Tramp! Alright, who fucking cares... but now she's leaving! She wants to leave us! Gotz it! At most they'll go aroud the block! They have no money... I won't see my little girl anymore... Folly! What little girl? She's 26! Becoz she'z my little girl Godz! Always will be! We have to take action... We said that! Mee iz ready! I'll club his head! That'll fix it! Here is my action! He's an idiot! I told you... This is the 70's! I'm surprised... You've been here in Milan for 30 years... we gave you a job, a northern education... and you come back with a "vendetta"! Is this a joke? But I'm a Father! You're a dickhead! Violence has to be rejected! Reject, always! But if there's no other way... Listen to the mobster! I don't understand you guys! What are you? Animals? Aren't you ashamed? Shame on you! Firts rule: a man has to be civilized! HEAD! So... the tramp takes my little one away... And you tell me... shush!! That little girl can slap down a cable-car! You have to understand, as a Father, she is free to make her own choices. "Gotz it"! OK. But if ya' knew your wifey gotz her hand on a peepee? If a woman decides to scram you have to be bright! Go to the centerfield and salute! If my wife left me for someone else I wouldn't oppose her! Thankz Giulio! Ya're a real friendz! Have mercy! Please leave before he comes back! Allright! I'm leaving... But first I want you to be sincere! Or else I won't leave! What do you want? Vincenzina, tell me if you love me! Answer me! Allright Giovanni! Yes I like you... I'm mad about you! Vincenzina, my love! I'm sick with love for you! That's what you wanted, coward! I love you, but we have to renounce this love! Why? We are both young.... It's the toy you gave Ciccio... Enough now! Scram it! You made me say it! Walk away forever... Ok I'll go! With my pain... my happiness... both too big... Farewell Vincenzina! I knew it! When you dream this stuff It's useless... dreams are never wrong! Dreams are rotten! I'll stay here for now... perhaps I'll crouch... Darn! It rains... Who cares if it's raining! Even the cat! Just like in the dreams... In the sad dreams I mean... I'll get up now! It's hard to get up... I'd rather go down... Giulio! Where were you? You're all wet! Nowhere, I was jogging... I'm so hungry I'd eat a baby! What did you prepare? Cold cutlets... rested... What's with the face? Why? You look a little dull. Perhaps it's the weather... Vincenzina, I want to tell you something You don't look very happy... Me? Let's cut to the chase... I heard everything you said to that guy in the kitchen! Calm down... Let's keep cool... It's not a tragedy... We can solve this, one way or another, right? See, you found someone as young as you, that's fine! It's all fine... even if it bothers me a little... What the hell... a lot! Are we or not in the 70's? So... We live in Milan, It's not southeast Asia! Just tell me: move aside and I'll do it. The End. About Ciccio, don't worry! I can provide you an amount... I know how lean a cop's paycheck is. In a few words, I'd rather see you happy away from me instead of being here thinking about him. Because I like you... ...a lot! I'm in love like a beast! I know... I know... you pity me... makes me look older than I am See, I came to the world the day you were 17, waiting for me at the factory 'cause, I was fresh-faced like you! I'm smaller than you... and sillier! What can I tell you... I'm a baby! Ouch! My back! You're a real man! Thank you! My little cuddles... I like you since I was in swaddle! You're full of hair... I did right choosing you! and I still choose you... 'cause you love me! Of course I do! I'll never leave you! I'll always be with my Giulio! - Always! - Always with me... A man like you deserves the greatest sincerity! I want to tell you everything! I already know everything How can you? I told you! I spied on you, I heard you in the kitchen Why? There's more? Yes. It was the doorbell's fault! It's still broken... Why? Wait... You had just left, and I had a feeling... - Remember I didn't want you to go? - No! Well... when a woman is afraid of a man it is a bad sign. Since you brought Giovanni home I felt that fear. But last time you didn't even want to invite him? Exactly! Bloody hell! I'd punch my face... I'm such an asshole! If you get angry I'll shut up! Ok, ok! But I'm not mad at you, I'm mad at me! Go on... Rocco's wife asked me to wash her cloths in our washer. So I informed her the washer was free. Since our doorbell was broken, I left the door open... I was tired... it was hot... Ciccio was asleep... ...perhaps the radio... anyways I was "blah"! What's "blah"? When your eyes close... Excuse me! Anybody home? Son of a bitch! Why didn't you slap him! I don't know! I played dead, like an animal in peril! - Do you know a St. Anthony Piglet? - No - It's a little bug that... - Ok, ok! And... Ooops... Excuse me! Vincenzina? That shithead couldn't arrive sooner! They ask for favors and then... The bastard took advantage! You were asleep, it's not your fault! It was an external kiss, no tongue, right? Yes, but... I didn't tell you all... I thought about him all night. I wanted to cast that kiss away, but... I turned in bed... felt cold... I wanted his body to heat me! Lack of kerosene! The radiator was off... Next morning I went shopping really early after the ugly night I felt nervous and absent minded. - I'll kill that guy! - Giulio! I'll shut up! Ok, ok! Go on... - Hi Vincenzina. - Good morning. I have to talk to you. Go ahead... Not here... Where? - At your house... - No, Giulio is not there! Actually that's why... I want a relationship with you! - I have to confess... - Go to the priest! Why the harsh tone! I perpretated an evil action towards you... I rented a small room... here's the address. Come today! Are you a fool? If you don't leave I'll call the cops! Brava! Well done! That's why I trust you! - It's not your fault! - It is! It's not over yet... Another round? - That same afternoon someone knocked at the door - That shirker! Is he never at work? That's why crime rates are high! I told you not to come! The water is boiling... Vincenzina! Yesterday I kissed you! What? When? Yesterday. The door was open. You were there... ...sleeping! But it seemed you were saying: "Don't be afraid!" "Come closer!" And I complied! ...and I kissed you! Softly... sweetly... Are you mad! Piss off... I was asleep! I didn't know... Shame! Leave this house... Scram! You vile! Yes! I am mad! Uncontrollable! I don't know what I am doing! Oh my God! Mamma mia! Yeah... Mamma mia! You deserved it dickhead! I was scared! "Oh my god I killed him", I thought. I felt his arms clasping my thighs! What? - And the head pressing here... - Where? Here! I held his head to push him... but my hands pulled him in... - What? - I held him strongly! - Giulio. He was crying! - You hit him! I felt his breath through my skirt. "I Love you, I love you", he said! - And Ciccio? - Was crying, poor thing... I stood there crying, my eyes closed... Giulio! Are you crying too? Fuck! I have the right to cry! I said no! Giovanni, its not possible! Got back to my senses. I pushed him. He kept quiet. I drove him out... I closed the door and fell down! End of drama? I wish... What's that? You never came back! What were you doing? Fuck! I was away 3 days! The next day I received his note. But I threw it away... Brava! That's the way to go... Yes. But I read it first! It said: "I have to talk to you. Urgent. And you didn't go... He was wearing his gray suit Don't brag. I just came to tell you to disappear If you're honored respect my will! Vincenzina! You're like a life vest to a drowning man! Without you I can't live! Vincenzina! What do I mean to you? Don't make me curse! You lie! Yesterday you replied my kiss! I felt you wavering... my head pressed to your womb... Admit it! If you are sincere, admit it! Don't yell! There's people around. Answer me! The truth hurts you? You don't think about Giulio? Aren't you ashamed, traitor! Ah! Thank God! Yes, Giulio well... I pity him! But love is larger than friendship! Love gives a fuck to friendship, honesty, hospitality... discipline! I deserted my post! I'm risking trial! You risk being shot by Giulio! So be it! So I can end this suffering! But... do you love me? Tell me... I'm a respectable woman! You're a hesitant woman! If you don't tell me... I'll kill myself! Swear to God! I'll kill myself! - My love! Come here! - No... No Giovanni! You wretch! What are you doing? [radio] I'm a woman, not a saint... So... you like me! I did it for pity! You're mine now! And I am yours! And he kissed me! Go on... No more... the next day you came back, and he showed up here. If I said I loved him he would leave... I said so... I lied: He is still in Milan. No more... I want to pluck him out of my heart! Hold on! But before what did you do? When? Before... there... at the railroad! I'll tell you if you are kind... understanding... from the 70's! I might be! But I'll get angry if you lie! What happened in that shack! Let's be crystal clear... civilized! Fucking Christ! What? Our Lady Punish me! Let me die! No! No Shame! What happened happened... I tried to avert him... but I had to fight for two... Two? Him and me! While I yelled "No, no!", my heart said "Yes, yes!" [radio] Please my love, let me be... [radio] I can't wait for you anymore... [radio] Hit, hit, even iron bends with fire even iron bends [radio] I'm a woman, not a Saint you know I'm not a Saint And he jumped on me! Be precise: without panties? Think so... Think so my ass! With or without? Without... So...recap! He jumps on you and the "union" occurs. Uniom... after... ...after what? After kisses everywhere... Where? Exactly where? Everywhere! Don't you know what it means? Even... like I do? Answer! More... No Giulio! Our Lady will kill me! Poor man... Ouch! Go away... Don't Giulio! Please! Please! Go on... tell everything! Quickly... [radio] Three months are a long wait [radio] When love whets you heart [radio] Please my love don't leave me... Vincenzina! You're a Bitch! I knew it! I knew it! Coward, liar! You wanted sincerity, and now you call me a Bitch! Bitch!! Bitch! Whore! Slut! I'll choke you! Gotz it! I'm worse than your hillbillies! Come here! You cheated on Basletti? Slut! Tramp! Harlot!! I'll break your redneck! Fuck! Fuck! Let us sleep! Shtick it up your Arse! It's my houze! Gotz it! I do what the fuck I want! You come back here... My God such a shame! We woke up everybody! Where are you going? Don't stage a circus! I'll jump! Me and the baby! I'm unworthy of this life! You didn't understand! I understood! Did you? I lost my mind! What can I do? Only men can cheat? I was mad in love... I didn't know what I was doing... Mad girls like you, you know what we call them? Yes! Bitch, you said it! Let me jump... Vincenzina! No... Giulio! Oh God! Ouch! What blow! What was that? The clothes line! How did you do that? It's high... I must have banged my horns! Remember I told you everything to square things up! Even if you kick me away... Kick who? At this point It's you decision... I did! Between you two I chose my husband. I'm his wife and this is our baby. So you're not my baby wife anymore? I'm the wife, isn't it better? Well... let's try to make it work. Be back together... and let it happen... Let's not tell anyone... that's crucial. It was a big cold shower Giulio! More like a big hammer! But we are back together now... Are we or not in the 70's? ...tomorrow is another day. A new life. Night is over... we forgot it all... grudge and revenge are not for me Vincenzina! I know Giulio! You're generous... from the 70's! Like a bottle of Lambrusco! C'mon! C'mon! The slow one! Don't you want to rest? Me! No! Ouch! What? Are you mad? Not this song! Sorry...

Tell me... Our lady! You scared me! Why aren't you asleep? I'm asleep... My belly is heavy... digestion... I'll prepare you something warm... Don't worry! I know what it is... It's that cheap sparkling wine... You look worn out lately... Frazzled. Frazzled? Well, at this point I'm rock bottom! Can you believe it! Look how a sound man, socially engaged, hard worker... ...an average man, turns into a clown! See you thursday for the touch up! I was setting up dinner, it's almost ready! Why so late? Sweetheart! What did you prepare me? Soup, cheese and broccoli. Vincenzina, look at me! What? Nothing new? No. What? Fuck you beautician! - Hi Concettina... - Hi I have to leave at 11:00 I can't take Ciccio - Can you look after him? - Sure! Thank you! It's the 3rd leave this week! What's going on? You're a superintendent! Are you ill? Yes I'm ill! What's up? Not physically... What then? What about anguish? ...the missed erections... don't count? You believe the inner evils belong to the ruling class? I have none... That's "lack of ignorance"! Give me the leave or I'll take it anyways... Follow that car! What? I mean, is it the same route? - What's its number? - 20 - And this? - 13 Does it seems right to you? Let me down... Giulio! Giulio! What are you doing here? Stop! Let's pause... Here I'm at the last steps of human idiocy! Restart... - What are you doing? - I'm an asshole... What are you doing? I came to buy you these slippers. So you stop walking around in jammies and unlaced shoes! Vincenzina! I'm thrashed! I'm scum! Why? I've been following you for 2 hours! Clutched to the bus... spying... thinking the worse... Instead, you were buying me slippers! - You followed me? - Yes Are you still jealous? I like you so much! I'm happy you like me too otherwise you wouldn't be so silly! You're a great woman! I'm a poor bastard... What's with the face? Mine? Take off the nose! Oops! Sorry! I'm an idiot! An idiot! At least I have my wife! But now I have to go back to the factory! I'm late! I've been out 2 hours! Love is great but work calls... - What do you want for dinner? - Surprise me! What's up? Broken elevator? Nice. Probably cheap too! Giulio? My love? Where are you? Well.. in the bathroom... Pasta soup, potato croquettes, cheese and fried apples! Is that good? Yes. At this plot point... yes, this is a film plot! I receive on time, a nice anonymous letter. Your wife betrays you with her lover in uniform. Everybody laughs at you! What are you waiting to kick her out? Are you a man? We all doubt it. Signed: A Friend Honey? Maria Rosa said she can take care of Ciccio if we want to go out! Take me dancing? I'm out of rhythm! Also not hungy... No, I don't want to...

He forgave me... ...and you would never see me again! I didn't want to come here. I wanted to go to my father and brothers... But they would acknowledge him! Don't worry! I'm here now! Mamma mia! Why is he carrying a typewriter? It's the double shot! He's mad! A double barrel? Take the kid... Go to the restroom! Don't worry! I'll show you! Where's she! Who? Don't be stupid! Vincenzina, take her out! She's not here! What? Kidnapping now? I'll shoot you! I told you: nobody's here! If you want a fire fight I have a 9mm! I'll kick your ass 9 times! Then I'll shoot you and her! This is not 70's talk! It's old fashioned! We are not underdeveloped! And if a young woman doesn't love you anymore, be noble! Understand... But I know your selfish generation! You only forgive if it's not your quarrel I'll show forgiveness... What are you doing! I pity you! If you appeal to "nobility" you shouldn't fuck your friend's wife! Vincenzina had a man! It was me! I'm her man! You're a man? You're a half jerk! More man than you! - You're a doll! - You're an old fart! This is a man! Look! Keep going... they'll transfer you to stamp licenses! You kicked you wife for an anonymous letter! None of your business! How do you know that? - You wrote it! - Yes! I knew you would kick her! She's not yours anymore! Vincenzina is mine! I have priority! And I have love rights! Mine! I held her at baptism! I was at the wedding! You were an unknown soldier! I raised her like a flower for 18 years! - She's mine! - Mine! Old cuckold! She's here! - I don't believe it! - Yes! Even if you show me I won't believe it! Allright! She's there! look! Where? - She was here before... - Not anymore... Not anymore... - Are you sure? - I swear! She left... The coffee! Do you want a cup of coffee? Sure... why not! - With some milk in it... - There's no milk! Why did she leave? Because... I know why... Why? Well... go figure... women! Many years went by from those days... ...ugly years at first! Then it got better... The first year apart from Giulio I rented a room in Melegnano. I sewed gloves for a company. Next year I moved to Settimo where I worked in a toy factory. Ciccio stayed at day care... There is one thing women at home don't understand about men: ...how ugly is factory work! Mom! 7 x 8, how much? Now I'm 26. I work here in Milan. We live in a 3 room house Ciccio is in 3rd grade. He speaks Milanese! Sometimes I don't understand him... I'm department chief at a famous clothing factory... I can't tell you which! I'm also a union representative. This one I picked from Giulio... 9th february I was promoted sergeant I'm married. 2 children... I root for Milan! Weight: 81Kg. I extracted 3 molars with cavities My hobby is model airplanes... ...on sundays, with my 2 kids: Albertino age 6, and Ersilio 4. My wife is nice: cooks, shops, keeps kids and house tidy. Faithful and obedient: as it should be! In these 7 years I had two other men: an accountant... nice guy, but a little neurotic. made weird noises in the bathroom... but mainly, he didn't care for Ciccio. He cared only about his health, and took pills, medicines... A couple of years ago I met Alessandro. Not so young, but elegant... He seemed just right. But after a financial crisis he became mean. He beat me! I beat him back! A pity... he used to be kind. He taught Ciccio a lot... I retired over a year ago. It's not so bad... My days are full: Shop and cook every morning... ...a little wine... nice sleep. In the afternoons I play boccia. In all modesty: I'm in a much higher league! Wednesdays and Fridays from 6:00 to 8:00... ...I go to the trade union office. At night: Orgies! Well: you see it! Here it is... the usual deal. Armetta, who can't play... His wife complaining... There's Father duties also! I pick up Ciccio at school and put him on the Bus. I go before the boccia game... there's a self service there... Well... I'll be 59 in april! I almost dropped women: I mean, the raw meats at least... Living alone has some advantages... but it's also a pain in the ass. The other day I asked Ciccio about an answer from his mother... Ciccio! Did you tell Mom that thing? So, when Ciccio asked me if Giulio could come for lunch sometime I said... well, ok! Every other saturday perhaps...
