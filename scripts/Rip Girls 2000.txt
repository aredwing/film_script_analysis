We Left When I Was Really Young, And Dad Never Wanted To Come Back, Probably 'Cause Of Mom. Sometimes I Think I Remember Her, But The Truth? The Picture In My Head? It's Probably Some Old Photograph. Elizabeth-- She's The Only Mom I've Known Up Close. Woman: Ladies And Gentlemen, If You Look Out The Left Side Of The Aircraft, You'll Get An Excellent View Of The Hawaiian Islands. That's Kauai To The Far Left, And The Big Island Of Hawaii On The Right. Sit Back, Sydney. Buckle Up. Sydney: I Know He Does It Because He Cares, Worrying Like That. But Still... Wow, This Is Magical. Yeah. It Really Is. Wow. I'm Gonna Look Around, Ok? Man: Paddle A Bit More. Sydney: I Used To Watch The Other Kids Doing Stuff, Stuff I Didn't Dare Try. I Didn't Feel Deprived. I Had Art Classes, Computers, But I'd Think About It, What It Would Be Like. [Coughs] [Meow] Aaaaah! [Meow] Ben: Sydney? Are You All Right? Yeah. It Was Just A Cat. [Sighs] You Be Careful. We Don't Know What We Might Find Here. Look At This Place. Oh, These Fabrics. 1940S. The Stitching-- Oh, No. No, No, No. We Made A Deal, Remember? Ben... Nothing Comes Back With Us. You Agreed. Yeah, Under Duress, Before I Saw What Was Here. Sydney, Wouldn't This Be Great In Your Room? Wouldn't You Love It? Hello. Oh, Hello. I Kolo Mai. I'm Sorry I'm Late. I Had To Stop By The Beach. The Waves Were Coming In So Pretty. Anyway, Aloha [Speaking Hawaiian] You Must Be Sydney. [Speaking Hawaiian] Welcome. Uh, Bo Kauihou. We Spoke On The Telephone. Oh, Right, Of Course. I--I Was Expecting... 3-Piece Suit? Well, I'm Afraid We Do Things A Lot More Casual Out Here. The Will Is Very Clear. As Ms. Leilani's Sister's Granddaughter, Sydney Is The Last Remaining Heir, The End Of The Line. So It All Goes To Her. Makai, The Whole Place. Providing She Comes In Person To Take Possession, Which She Obviously Has. And That She Stays 2 Weeks. 2 Weeks? Those Are The Conditions. But-- But The Makai Kuau, They Have Been Ranching Here For 5 Generations. Pineapple, Sugarcane, Cattle. The Place Has Gotten Run Down These Past Years, But The Land, It Is Still Fertile. It Could Come Back. Working Plantation? You Got To Be Kidding. This Is Beachfront Property. There Are Still Value In The Old Ways. Yes, But We Got To Be Practical. We're Not Exactly Farmers. Suppose We Bring In A Crew. Cleaned It Up, Painted It. You Think We Could Find A Buyer? There Have Been Some Inquiries. Really? Already? What Kind Of Inquiries? Look, You've Got To See This. What Is It? The Whole Family, I Think. [Sighs] These Are Old. Wow. Yeah. They Seem So Far Away. Dad? Is It Her? Is That Mom? I Never Saw A Picture Of Her Like That. Did She Surf? She Was So Beautiful. [Thunder] [Buzzing] [Meow] [Meow] [Meow] [Meow] [Hoo Hoo Hoo] [Clicks Tongue] Here, Kitty, Kitty, Kitty. [Clicks Tongue] Here, Kitty, Kitty. [Cat Meows] [Cat Meows] [Hoo Hoo Hoo] Oh, My Gosh! Look Out! Are You Ok? I Didn't See You. Ho, You're Flying At Mach 10. What'd You Do, See A Ghost Or Something? You're Lucky I Didn't-- Whoa, Sick Board. Well, It's Pretty Cool, I Guess. It's Insane. Hey, How's It Ride? I Bet It's Awesome, Huh? Well... It's Like, You Know. Sweet. Definitely. I'm Gia. Sydney. Wait A Second. You're The Long Lost Relative, Yeah? I Mean, The Whole Weird Trip About Leilani's Will. How'd You Hear About That? This Is The Islands, Sistah. News Travels Fast Around Here. Wow. I'm So Not Good With Computers. I Can't Believe You Can Do All This. It's Not That Hard, Really. These Are Awesome. You're Really Good. You Ever Shoot In The Water? You Know, Up Close? Well, That's When You Get The Full-On Drama Shots. You Know, Inside The Curl? The Board Flying Right At You. Putting It All On The Line. It Sounds Wild. Yeah! Like Riding The Big Ones, Deep Thud Pounding Your Eardrums, Your Heart Beating So Fast-- Well, It's The Best. I Was Thinking Maybe We Could Hike Into Kaala Loa Valley Tomorrow, Maybe Get Some Rocks To Take Home. Sound Good? Or There's An Exhibit At The School-- Handmade Quilts. Could Be Fabulous. Sydney? Oh, Sorry. Um, About Tomorrow? I Was Actually Thinking About Going To The Beach. The Beach? Sure. Um, That Sounds Good, Doesn't It, Ben? A Picnic. I Could Get Us Some Sandwiches-- No, I Mean, Just Me. See, I Met This Girl. Her Name's-- I Don't Want You Going Down There, Sydney, Not To The Beach. It's Hawaii, Dad. That's Where Kids Go. They Go All The Time. Not Alone. I Won't Be Alone. Gia's Going With Her Friends. We'll All Be Together. We Don't Even Know These Kids. I'll Be Careful, Dad. I Promise. No. I'm Sorry. Honey, It's Just Not A Good Idea. That Is So Unfair. You're Treating Me Like I'm A Baby. I'm 13. She Said She'd Be Careful, Ben. She Knows What She's Capable Of. Trust Her. Does She Know About Undertows? About Riptides? Does She Know How These Currents Can Just Come Whipping Up Out Of Nowhere? Ok. Ok, Just Take It Easy. What If I Don't Even Go In The Water? What If I Just Take Pictures? Would That Be Ok? Dad? Please? Ben? Elizabeth: Have Fun. Bye. Hello There. Hi. Sydney... You Have The Cell Phone, Right? If You Need Us? Got It. You Know The Number? Dad. What If She's Not There, This Girl? She'll Be There. But If She's Not? I'll Come Back. Right Back. Hello There. Aloha. This Is Ben And Elizabeth. Hi. Hi, Ben. Hi, Nice To See You. Ok. Bo: Uh, These Are The Realtors I Told You About. Whooooo! Hey! Hey! Who's The Grom? You Know Her? She's The One I Told You About. Oh. Hey, You Made It. Yeah, I Made It. It's So Good Out There. Head-High Waves. Perfect Rights. Come On. You Know, I Think I'll Just, Like, Hang A Little Bit. You Know, Cruise. Ok, Sure, Whatever. Ok. Wow, What A Great Beach House. Yeah, We Put It Together From Things We Found On The Beach. Cool. Uh-Huh. Ooh! Good Way To Lose A Fin. If You Don't Trip Or Fall Right Down All Your Favorite Bands Are All Sold Out Hey. Hi. This Is Lanea... Hi. And Mele. Hi. Hi. Sydney, Right? Yeah. You From The Mainland? Chicago. Oh, That's Where The Wind Surfing Goes Off, Yeah? Well, The Wind Blows Pretty Hard Off The Lake, But I Never-- Your Board Is Awesome. Pretty Old School. Didn't I Tell You? Isn't It Seriously Outrageous? Boy: Hey, Girls! Hey! Hey! Hey, What's Up? What's Going On? Hey, Let's Go Surf. Come On, Let's Go Surfing. All Right. Please Come To The Show Tonight I Promise Everything's Gonna Be All Right This Is So Pathetic. Stuck In Dry Dock. I Can't Believe It. The Worst. Except You Get To Hang With Us. When's It Come Off? Uh, Not Soon Enough. What'd You Do? Skateboard Wreck. Crashed Off A Half Pipe. He Tried A 4 1/2, Which Is Of Course Nuts. 'Cause Nobody Does A 4 1/2. You're Just Jealous 'Cause I'm Gonna Nail It Before You Do. In Your Dreams, Plaster Arm. I'm Outta Here. Laters. Yo, Kai! It's Bowling Out There! Go Charge It, Bra! What, Break Your Lens? I'm Kona. Sydney. Hey, Come On. Watch Mele. Leg Drop. Phat Snap. Deep Bottom Turn. She's Going Off! That's Good, Right? That's Hot. See? Totally Fearless. But Don't Tell Her I've Been Bragging On Her. We Wouldn't Want Her Getting A Big Head. [Shutter Clicking] [Gasp] Is She All Right? Oh, Yeah. You're A Surfer, Too? I Mean, When You're Not Wearing That. Everyone Surfs Around Here, Unless They're A Major Dork. You're A Longboarder, Ey? Sort Of. I Ride Shortboard. Uh, But I Like Those, Too. Exactly. The Thing About The Longboards, Riding Them? It's Like Cruising On The Waves, Slow And Fluid. Keeps You Connected. But A Shortboard, It's Like Daring You To Meet The Edge, Slice Through The Other Side. You Make Your Own Rules. What? You're A Poet. I Didn't Expect It. I Don't Know, It's Nice. It Must Be Hard, I Mean, Learning How To Ride The Short Ones. Must Take Forever, Huh? You've Never Been Out There Before, Have You? What?! Why Would You Say That? Because You Haven't, Right? Well, You Mean, Technically? Out There Surfing? No. Never Even Tried? There's Not A Lot Of Surf In Lake Michigan. I Mean, Besides, I Know What My Parents Would Say-- Too Risky, Too Dangerous, Too Everything. That Is So Crazy. Keep Your Center Of Balance. Now Paddle. Harder. Harder. Ok, Now Stand Up. Come On, Stand Up! Yeah! Yeah! You've Got It, You're Ready. For What? Well, What'd You Think? Gia? What? You Scared? No. Yeah. Hey, Being Scared, That's Half The Fun. Your Heart Pounding So Hard, All You Want To Do Is Quit, And Then Doing It Anyway. They're Gonna Think I'm A Major Dork. You Don't Surf For Your Friends. You Do It For Yourself. For The Way It Makes You Feel Inside. It's Like Floating On Clouds. Come On. Don't Forget, Keep Your Board To The Side. Hey, You'll Get It. In How Many Lifetimes? No Rush. The Ocean's Not Going Anywhere. I Am. I'm Only Here For 2 Weeks. What About Makai? I Mean, Isn't It Yours? Aren't You Staying? How Can We? My Dad's An English Professor, And My Stepmom Designs Fabrics For This Big Company. I Don't Think They'd Want To Move. What About You? What Do You Want? Sydney? Your Things On The Floor? That's Why They Make Hampers, Ok? [Shower Stops] [Curtain Opens] Sydney? We'd Like To, Uh, Eat Dinner At 7:00. Can You Be Ready? Yeah, Sure. Good. Did You Have Fun With Your Friends Today? Were They Helpful? What? About Having Their Pictures Taken. They Didn't Mind? Oh, Yeah. They Were Great. Elizabeth... Hmm? Since We Got Here, Dad's Been So Weird, You Know? More Than Usual. Is He Like Mad At Me Or Something? Has He Said Anything? No, No, Honey, It's Not You. He's Not Mad At You. It's, Um... Sometimes Adults Just Get Lost In Their Own Problems And They Don't Realize-- What? Is Dad Losing His Job? Is He Sick? No, No, No, Nothing Like That. It's Just Stuff. Boring Adult Stuff. He Treats Me Like I'm A Piece Of Glass, Like I'm Gonna Break. Well, You're His Little Girl. He Worries. That's What Dads Do. They Worry. But It's Not Like I'm This Out Of Control Crazy. I'm Really Careful. I Know That, And He Knows That, And That's Good. Sometimes I Wish I Wasn't, That I Wasn't So Careful. I Could Just Try Things, Like Everyone Else. Not Think So Much. Sweetheart, We All Do Things At Our Own Pace, And There's Nothing Wrong With That. As Far As Thinking Too Much, Just Keep Using That Head Of Yours. You're Good At It. All Right? You Said That This Buyer Made A Previous Offer? Oh, Yeah, Not That It Was Taken Seriously. Old Mrs. Leilani. She Was Such A Dear Woman. You Would Have Adored Her, But, You Know, She Was Hardly Interested In Selling. Makai Was Her Home. The Only One She'd Ever Known. She Loved It Here. Which Meant She Didn't Even Take A Look At Our Original Proposal We Brought. Oh, No, It Wouldn't Have Mattered If King Midas Himself Had Offered Every Ounce Of His Gold. And That's Pretty Much The Kind Of Offer These Horden Folks Delivered. Yeah. Here, Come Look, You'll Absolutely Gush. Let's Look. Ta-Da! The Detail's Amazing. Look, Even The Little Trees. Isn't It Something? Where's The House And The Old Barn? Oh, They'll Keep The Name. "Horden Resort At Plantation Makai." But You Could Hardly Expect Them To Keep The Original Structures. Why Not? They're Historical. Yes, 1912. That's When They Rebuilt It After The Big Storm. It Is A Charming Old House. It'd Be Almost A Shame To See It Go. Well, There Is No Reason Why We Can't Talk To Horden About Preserving Some Of These Buildings. Uh, In Fact, The Main House Would Make A Darling Little Restaurant. That's An Inspired Idea. It's Brilliant. What Happens To The Beach? Oh, Not One Thing. It Remains As Pure And Pristine As Ever. The Guests Would Hardly Settle For Anything Less. So It Would Only Be Open To Hotel Guests? Everything's Negotiable. Believe Me, Every Little Detail Can Be Worked Out. Right, Bo? Why Don't You Draw Up The List Of Concerns For Horden? If That's What The Millers Want. It's Certainly A Lot To Think About. Well, It Never Hurts To Open A Dialogue, Just See What Your Options Are. James; Well, I Think Once Again If We Take A Look At Horden's Track Record... Arlene: Absolutely. [Singing In Hawaiian] Hey! It's Only Water. Where You Been? I Was Busy. You Didn't Chicken Out? Thought About It. Guess I'm Still Thinking About It. Don't Worry, Girl. You Owning These Waves Today. I Can Feel It. You Want Some? It's Spam Musabi. Total Energy Food. No, Thanks.

He's My Boy. So You Like Him? Completely. Hey, He's My Best Friend. He's Almost Like A-- Wait A Second. You Mean Like Him Like Him? Yeah. [Laughing] Kona? No Way. Not Like That. Why? Do You? Hey, That's Awesome. He'll Be Stoked. Hey, Kona! No, No, No, No! You Can't. I'd Just Die. Ok. Fine. Promise? But He'd Definitely Be Stoked. You Think So? Oh, Yeah. Is He As Together As He Seems? Best Part? He's A Great Listener. You Can Tell Him Almost Anything. Really? And You Know Those Cartoons In The Clubhouse? They're His. He Drew Those? Oh, Yeah. Kona's A Star. Hey, But Don't Get Too Excited. 'Cause Under All That Nuggetry, He's Still A Thick-Headed Gross-Out Boy Just Like The Rest Of Them. Hey. Come On, Move It. We've Got Waves To Catch. I Think I'll Just Hang It Up While.. You Know, While I'm Ahead. Stop. Come On, It'll Be Perfect, Just Like Before. Come On. Yeah. That's The Way. You Got It. Ok. Now Sit Up. Good. Turn Around. No. Sydney! Not This One! Oh! Hang On! Is She Gonna Be All Right, Gia? Somebody Go Get My Mom. Go Get Malia. Hurry. Is It That Bad? You'll Be Ok. I Mean, A Little Dinged, But No Permanent Damage. Uh! [Rope Creaking] [Low Moan] [Startled Gasp] [Wind Chimes Ringing Gently] [Moan] [Moan] Uh-Uh-Uh. Stop Feeling Sorry For Yourself. You're Fine. Do You Remember What Happened? I Think So. I Don't Really Want To Talk About It. Oh. Tell Me. It Was In Slow Motion. Scary, But... Not Scary, At The Same Time. Like I Was Watching The Whole Thing From Someplace Else. Like I Was Some Other Person Watching Myself Drown. Well, You Drink This. Drink It. Mmm! Good, Yeah, That. What Is It? Old Island Cure, A Secret From The Menehuene-- The Little Ones. Bring It In The Night When No One Can See. You're Teasing Me. No. It's Always At Night. If They're Caught By The Sun, They...They Turn To Stone. Everyone Knows That. Why Are You Staring Like That? Oh, You're So Much Like Her. Like Who? Gia: Hey, Mom. Hey. How's The Head? Ok. But I Sure Messed Up, Huh? I Thought It Was All Over. Nah. The Wave Would've Spit You Out. No Big Thing, Yeah? How About Kona? Is He Ok? Well, His Cast Is A Little Soggy, But You Made Him A Hero. He's Stoked. He Wants To Know When You're Going Back Out. In The Water? How About The Week After Never? Never's A Long Time. Sydney: Are They All Yours? My Mom's, Mostly. She Surfs, Still? Malia: Hey. I Heard That. Well, Not That You're Old Or Anything. I Didn't Mean That. Uh-Huh. Sydney: Oh, No. I Can't Believe I Wrecked It. Yeah, Well, Maybe Mom Can Fix It. Really? Could You? She's The One You Remind Me Of. There Was A Real Naniloa? Absolutely. That Was Her Nickname-- Your Mother. Are You Serious? Mm. This Was Hers. When I First Saw It, I Felt Something... Like I Could Just Tell. Were You Friends, You And My Mom? Like Sisters. Ever Since We Were Little, We Did Everything Together. Your Dad Never Mentioned Anything? He Doesn't Talk Much, Not About Her. Well, She Was Amazing, Always Laughing. It Was Contagious. She Made Everybody Smile. And Full Of Energy, Huh? She Would Walk Into A Room, And You Could Almost See It. It's So Strange... Hearing About Her, Having Something That Was Hers. It Almost Makes Her Real. I Wanna Show You Something. Look. See? We Gotta Climb. Come On. Sydney: It's The Most Beautiful Place I've Ever Seen. The Whales Come Here With Their Young Every Year About This Time. It's An Extraordinary Place, Sacred. Have You Ever Seen Them? Mm-Hmm. And The First Time Was With Your Mom. We Were A Little Younger Than You, And Your Great-Grandmother Brought Us. There's A Welcoming Ceremony. It's A Celebration Naniloa Thought Was Magical. She Said It Was Something She'd Never Forget. Could You Bring Me? I Mean, If They Come While I'm Here. Could You? It's Like Being Offered A Gift, Seeing The Whales. You Have To Be Ready For It. Sydney: Hello? Anybody Home? Probably Called Out The National Guard By Now. No. They Can't Be That Worried. Elizabeth: Sydney? Is That You? Or Maybe They Can. Should I Tell Them? It's Up To You. Oh, We've Been So Worried. Your Father's Out There Right Now Looking Everywhere For You. What Happened? Are You All Right? Yeah. It's Nothing, Just A Little Cut. I'm Fine. This Is Gia's Mom-- Malia. She Took Care Of Me. Thank You So Much. Really. You Didn't Get Stitches, Did You? What'd You Hit It On? It's No Big Deal, Honest. She's Fine. [Car Door] Ben? She's Here. [Footsteps] You're Safe. Thank Heaven. Where Have You Been? What Happened? I... I, Uh... Well... I Know I Wasn't Supposed To, But... Being A Part Of It... Not Being Stuck On The Outside, But Really Being A Part Of Something, I Always Wanted That. What Are You Talking About, Baby? You're Not Making Sense. Well... I Went Surfing With The Other Kids. What?! I'm Sorry, But... I Know You Didn't Want Me To Go Out There, But I Had To Try-- To See If I Could Do It. And Then I Fell, But... I Didn't Get Hurt, Not Seriously. So There's Nothing To Worry About, Right, Dad? Go To Your Room, Sydney. But, Dad-- To Your Room. Now. That's Not Fair. I Just-- Sydney! Ben: How Could You Do This? Malia: She Wanted It. You Heard Her. This Has Nothing To Do With Me. I'm Supposed To Believe That, That You Weren't Out There Cheering Her On, Filling Her Head Full Of Stories? Well, You Certainly Haven't Been. Everything Is Completely Foreign To Her. You've Never Even Mentioned My Name. Why? Why Haven't You Told Her, Ben? I Am Not Gonna Let Her Get Hurt. That Is The Bottom Line. She Needs To Know Who She Is And Where She Comes From. She Does. No. You've Kept Her From It. You Whisked Her Away, And You've Cut Her Off. I Have Tried To Do What's Best For Her. That Is All I Care About. I've Never Seen Him Like This. He's So... I Know. It'll Be Ok. She Oughta Be Grabbing Life With Both Hands, But You've Got Her So Scared, So... Don't Make It Sound So Simple. Use What's Here, Ben. The Ocean Is A Great Healer. And A Great Destroyer. No. If You'd Just Seen Her Out There With Gia. She Is A Natural, Just Like Her-- Leave Her Alone, Malia. Back Off. You Can't Protect Her Forever. I Can Try. Stop Running From It, Ben. Pry It Open, This Lid You've Got Clamped Down So Hard. Let It Go. Let Things Heal. [Car Door] [Sigh] Elizabeth: She's Not Entirely Wrong. I Didn't Even Know You Were There. That's Part Of The Problem. Things Will Be Fine Once We're Back Home, Away From This Place. Everything Will Be Normal Again. What Is That Supposed To Mean, That We'll Just Keep Pretending It Never Happened? No, Of Course Not. Ben, If You'd Fallen In Love With Another Woman, Someone Flesh And Blood, I'd Know What To Do. And I Would Fight Like Crazy To Hang On To Us, To What We Have Together. But This? Liz... What Am I Supposed To Do? Tell Me, Ben. How Am I Supposed To Fight A Ghost? Hey. Hey. I Called Your House. Your Stepmom Said You Were Out Here. You Ok? Yeah. You Sure? A Little Bummed. My Dad Was So Mad. I Heard. If I Try It Again, He'll Probably Ground Me For Life. What's His Problem? Must Be All About Your Mom's Accident, Huh? What Do You Know About It? Did Malia Tell You? Well, Not Much. I Mean, You Know, Just That There Was An Accident Out There. In The Ocean? That's Just What I've Always Heard. Of Course, I Could Have It All Wrong. It Wouldn't Be The First Time. I Mean, Don't You Know? What Does Your Dad Say? Nothing. That's The Problem. How Come You Never Asked Him? Stupid, Huh? Not Knowing, Not Making Him Tell Me. It's Not Too Late. Hey, Gia! I Was Wondering If-- Shh! Not Now. She Can't Be Disturbed. Mele: It's Desperation Time. Nothing But Trash Out There. Concentrate. O Goddess Hi'iaka, Ancient Mistress Of The Ocean, Pioneer Surfer Chick, Our Forbearer, Our Guide, We Call Your Name In... In The... Fervent Hope? Good. Yeah. In The Fervent Hope That Tomorrow Will Bring Us A Day Of Monstrous Surf. Gia, Lanea, Mele: Hi'iaka, Hi'iaka. Hi'iaka. Hi'iaka. Hi'iaka. Hi'iaka, Hi'iaka-- Kai: Charge! [Girls Screaming] Lanea: Stop! [All Laughing] Don't Run. Stop! Cut It Out! Give Me That, You Dork. Yeah, You Think You're Funny? Run! Yeah, That's What I Thought. [Laughter] I Didn't Know I Was Showing Off. I Never Got A Chance To Say Thanks For Saving My Life. Hey. I Just Got There First. Gia Was Right Behind Me. We Weren't Gonna Let You Drown. No Way. Hey. I Made Something For You. Don't Get Too Excited. It's Not Much, But... Here. That's Great. I Love It. Now When You Get Back To Chicago, You Can Show All Your Friends What A Hot Dogger You Are. They'd Never Buy It, Not A Chance. Would You Mind If I Asked You A Big Favor? What? You Know This Place? Yeah. The Old Plantation House-- Uh, Kaala Loa. It's Abandoned Now. Nobody Goes Up There Anymore. Could You Take Me? It's Kinda Spooky Up There. I Don't Care. All Right. But I Gotta Ask You One Question. How Well Do You Ride? [Shutter Clicking] Can You Imagine How Awesome It Must've Been When This Place Was Happening? There Were Major Luaus. My Mom Talks About Them. On A Full Moon, They Say You Can Hear Slack Guitars Wailing Away. Oh, Right. Like This Place Is Haunted Or Something. Please. We Could Find Out. Next Full Moon, Camp Up Here? If You're Not Too Scared. Woooo.... Oh, Yeah, Cowboy? [Laughing] Hey, Get Back Here! Oh, Man. Don't Take My Hat. Sydney, Catch! Kona: Hey, Where You Going? Oh, Get Back Here. Come On, Right Now. Go For It, Girl. Run. All Right. Give Me The Hat. No! Give Me The Hat! Get Away! It's My Hat! Oh! All Right. Gia: What's Going On? I Think This Was Her Room... When She Was Little. I Think She Showed It To Me Once. Your Mom? I Can Almost Remember... When She Brought Me. I Couldn't Have Been More Than 2, But... I Know I Was Here. The Smell, That's What I Remember The Most. We Wanted You To See This Right Away. Not Just Hear It Over The Telephone. You Must Think It's A Pretty Fair Offer. James: Tricorp's Acquiesced About Everything-- Ecological Concerns, Watershed Issues. Everybody Gets What They Want. We Hope You Have Your Ivy League College Picked Out. They've Given 72 Hours For A Response. We're Supposed To Have An Answer That Fast? Bo? They Like To Keep The Ball Rolling On These Deals. Can't Give You Too Much Time To Think. James: Actually, It's A Very Generous Time Frame. And A Very Generous Offer. Well, Obviously, You Think We Should Accept. No Concerns? It's That Good? Arlene: My Honest Opinion? If I Were Sitting In Your Place, I Would Grab It In A Heartbeat. [Pebbles Clattering Against Wall] Hey. What's Going On? Who's Out There? Gia: Sydney? Gia? What Are You Guys Doing? Malia Sent Us. She Said It's Time. Come On, Hurry. [Hawaiian Music Plays] Hey! Aloha, Girls. Hi. Hey, Mom. Have Fun. Yeah, We Will. Gia: Come On. Let's Dance. Hey. No, Come On. Get Back Here. It's Good. Try This. Yeah, She Did It. [Speaking Hawaiian] Kona, TRANSLATING: A Long Time Ago, In The Time Of The Double Canoes, There Was A Girl In Nu'alolo. She Was Strong... And Graceful... With Firelight In Her Hair. She Loved A Boy... Who Loved Her Back. But His Father, The King, Demanded A Test. Only If She Surfed The Great Tsunami... Could She Marry His Son. The Boy Grew Worried. No One Had Ever Survived The Great Tsunami. The Girl Knew She Had To Try. The Meneheunes Took Pity... And Brought Her The Branch Of An Iliahi Tree. "Its Magic Will Keep You Safe," The Little People Told Her. So She Paddled Into The Night For The Giant Wave, Her Heart Beating Fast. A Lei Of Iliahi Flowers Draped Around Her Neck. Did She Survive? The Colors Of The Rainbow Danced On Their Wedding Day. Come On! They're Here! Yeah! They're Here. They're Here Come On, The Whales! They're Here! Come On! Come On! Come On! The Whales Are Here! It Is Magical. Thanks For Letting Me Be A Part Of It. You Know, In The Stories, They Say Our Ancestors Are Out There Watching Over Us. And That The Whales Move Back And Forth Between The Two Worlds, Linking One To The Other. That's One Of The Truths, Yeah, That We're All Connected. Never Alone, That's Aloha. Were You There When It Happened? My Mom's Accident? Could You Tell Me About It? Do You Really Want To Know? That Day The Waves Were Awesome, And Naniloa Came Over, So Excited. Everything Was Perfect, So... We Took The First Rides Together, Naniloa Flying Down These Big Breakers, Cutting Back Into The Curl, A Huge Smile On Her Face. That Day Out There, We Owned The Waves, Yeah. Everything Was Going Perfect. Then I Guess We Got Tired, So We Were Coming In. I Was In Front. And All Of A Sudden, Your Mom's Board Comes Rocketing Up. I Looked Back, And I See This Huge Swell Coming, And The Waves Stacking One On Top Of The Other, Seeing Naniloa Trapped In The Middle Of It. She's Caught In This Current, And It's Sweeping Her Down Towards The Rocks. Your Father... Didn't Really Want To Know What Happened. He Could Barely Even Listen. He Just Wanted To Get Away, And Get You Out Of Here. It's Like... He Blamed The Islands For Losing Her. Your Mom Fought So Hard In Those Waves To Get Back To You, Sydney. That's Why. She's Supposed To Be Here While I'm Growing Up. I Hate Her For Not Thinking About That. Oh, You Have To Forgive Her, Sydney, Both You And Your Dad. Why? For Your Own Sake. Sydney? I Left You A Note So You Wouldn't Worry. I Found It. Malia Brought Me Back. I Saw. You Should Have Told Me About It. It Shouldn't Have Been Some Deep, Dark Secret. [Door Slams] [Sobbing] Ben. I Kept Thinking... That I Should Have Been There When It Happened. That I Should Have Saved Her... Stopped Her.... Something. It Was An Accident. Nobody's Fault. When I Lost Her, I Didn't Think I'd Ever Love Anyone Again. And Then... I Found You. It Didn't Seem Fair That I Should Be So Happy, And She's-- Oh, Ben. She Would Want You To Be Happy, You And Sydney, Us--All Of Us. She Would Want That. Want To Take A Walk? Sure. When People Ask Me What She Was Like, I Make Things Up. Fill In The Blanks. I Have This Whole Strange Fantasy In My Head About What She Was Like 'Cause Nobody Ever Told Me. What Do You Want To Know? Everything. Sometimes When I Looked At Her, It Took My Breath Away. She Was So Beautiful With This Beauty That Came From The Inside, Out... Radiant, Like You. A Lot Like You. You Have So Much Of Her. Really? She Had A Natural Grace, The Way She Moved... And The Way She Laughed. I Wish I Could Have Known Her. Me, Too. Elizabeth And I, We've Been Talking. About The Sale? I Thought I Was Protecting You By Getting You Away From Here. But Malia Was Right. I Was Just Running. Makai Is Your Heritage, Sydney. You Have To Decide What To Do With It, What You Want. This Decision Belongs To You. But I'm Just A Kid. How Am I Supposed To Know What To Do... What's Right? Sometimes You Don't Know. Sometimes You Just Have To Cross Your Fingers And Hope. What About The Money? I'd Be Lying To You If I Told You We Didn't Need It, That It Didn't Matter. Of Course It Matters. I'll Be Teaching The Rest Of My Career And Never I'll Never See This Kind Of Money Again. But Liz Says That That Isn't Always What's Important. Maybe She's Right. Anyway, Whatever You Decide, We'll Be There. We'll Make It Work. Do You Think We Could Stay Here? Live Here? There's Lots Of Lost Memories. Lots Of Ghosts. Maybe That's Good. Sydney: Hi. What's Up? Are You Guys Going Surfing? Let's Get Out Of Here. It's Beginning To Stink. Yeah, Kind Of Like Dead Fish. Over This. Let's Go. And We're Gone. What's The Matter With Everybody? Why Are You Acting Like I've Suddenly Got The Plague, Or Something. I Can't Believe You're Here, That You'd Show Your Face. Why Would You Say That? But We Haven't Even Decided Anything. Gia! Gia! Malia! Anybody Home? [Hip Hop Music Plays] How Long Have You Been There? I'm Looking For Gia. Not Here. Oh. Well... Ok. Are You Ok? I Wasn't Sure If You're Still Talking To Me. Are You? That's Kind Of What We're Doing Now, Isn't It? What's Under There? What Are You Working On? Nothing. It's Nothing. Really? Maybe I Should Have Asked First. I Mean If You Don't Like It-- No, No, It's Not That. I'm Surprised, That's All. Malia's Been Teaching Me To Shape, And I Needed The Practice, It's Wonderful. Thank You. Everybody Else Hates Me. They Think I'm A Traitor, Scum Of The Earth... Lower, Even. About Makai? Nothing's Even Been Decided. Not Yet. Kai's Betting You'll Grab The Bucks And Run. You Should Have Heard Gia Lay Into Him For Saying That. She Stood Up For Me? Oh, Yeah. Big Time. Sydney: Gia! Hey. How'd You Find Me? Kona. He Never Could Keep A Secret. This Is Supposed To Be My Own Private Place. I Come Here When I Need Time Alone. You Know, When Things Are Really Bugging Me. I Don't Know, Something About Being Here Just Smooths Everything Out. Tell Me You Don't Surf That. Malia Would Have A Cow If She Knew. Last Time, It Was My Birthday. My Dad Was Supposed To Call From Bali Or Australia, Wherever The Heck He Was. He Promised. And For Some Dumb Reason, I Believed Him. So, I Waited Around, Like, The Whole Day. But I Guess He Forgot. It Was My Own Fault. I Mean, I Should Have Known. But Hey, Once You're Out There? All The Bad Stuff Falls Away. Did You Read It? The Whole Thing? Even The Part About The Whales? Did You See? The Lagoon Will Be A Preserve. They Made Them Promise. At Least We're Trying To Keep What's There, What's Special. It's A Resort, Sydney. Everything Will Change. You Think The Whales Will Keep Coming Back Once Their Lagoon's Filled With Tourists? When We First Met At Makai, Did You Plan It... You And Malia? I Mean, The Inheritance, Is That Why You Became My Friend? What?! Where'd You Get That? The Truth, Gia. Kind Of. I Mean, We Thought That, You Know, If You Got To Know Everybody, If I Accidentally Ran Into You And Got Things Started. But It Changed. Hey! Sydney, Listen To Me. Once We Got To Know Each Other, It Changed. I Stopped Being Your Friend Because I Was Supposed To, I Just Did It Because It Was Fun. Listen-- Why? So You Can Lie Some More? It's The Truth. Boy, You're Good. Ever Consider Going To Hollywood, Making Use Of That Talent? This Isn't An Act. God, I'm Not Trying To Work You, Why Would You Say That? 'Cause That's All I Hear. Lies On Top Of Lies On Top Of Lies. You Weren't Exactly Telling The Truth, Either. Pretending To Be Some Big Surfer Chick. I Never Said I Could Surf. You Assumed. Oh, I Get It. My Lies Count, But Yours Don't. They All Knew, Didn't They? You Let Me Make A Fool Of Myself In Front Of Everyone. You Didn't Need Any Help Playing The Fool. You Handled That All On Your Own, Like Some Stupid Lovesick Puppy. Kona?! Was He In It, Too? I Hate You! I Hate All Of You! And You Know What? I Am Going To Sell Makai. I'm Gonna Get Off This Stupid Island, And Forget Any Of You Existed. Fine! Go Back, Then. Who Needs You! Sydney! James: Everything's Ready. Is That For Us? Well, We Thought A Little Toast Might Be In Order. It's Sparkling Cider... In Honor Of Sydney. Elizabeth: Thank You. Here You Go, Honey. Ben: Bo? Thank You. Sydney. James: To A Hard-Fought Decision, And A Bright Future. Congratulations. You All Right? Yeah. All That's Left, Is To Cross The Ts And Dot The Is. Malia! Gia! Are You In There? Hello! Sydney? I Didn't Expect To See You. I Thought You'd Be Getting Ready To Go. Packing. I Had To Tell You Myself-- You And Gia. I Mean, There's Still Lots Of Things To Work Out, But-- No, Please. I Don't Need To Know The Gruesome Details. But I Didn't Want You To Hear From Anyone Else. No, It's Ok. You Did What You Had To. There's No Need To Explain. Probably Wasn't Even Fair What We Were Asking, Yeah? I Mean, You Were So Young When You Left, And You've Been Gone So Long, How Could Makai Still Be A Part Of You? There's No Reason It Should Be. It's Just That We Thought... Maybe. If You Came Home... And You Saw It Again That It Would Touch You And You'd Have Enough Of Your Mother To Feel Some Of The Things She Felt About This Place. It Was A Shot. And At Least You've Seen It, And At Least Now You Know. You'll Have That To Keep. Here. Open It. Go On. She'd Want You To Have It. Gia. Oh, I Thought You Were Gia. Her Mom Said She Was Here. Have You Seen Her? No, I Haven't. She Took Off. Do You Know Where She Went? Please, Kona. Even If She Told You Not To Tell, It's Really Important. I Need To Talk To Her. She Said You Were Gonna Sign The Papers And Leave, You Never Wanted To See Us Again. Any Of Us. Good Riddance. That's What She Said. She Was Really Down, Like Everything Was Falling Apart. Hey. Sydney! What's Going On? What's The Matter? Gia's Out There Somewhere. I Know It. No Way. She Wouldn't Surf Alone. That's Too Crazy. We Better Find Her. I'll Take That Way. Gia! Kona: Gia! Kona: Gia! Gia. Gia! Gia. Gia! Gia! Gia, I'm Coming! Gia! Gia, I'm Coming! Oh, No. [Coughing] You Ok? [Coughing] What Happened? [Coughing] Went Over The Falls... And Then Hit The Reef. My Arms Hurts A Lot. Hold On. I'll Get You Back In. Gia! Sydney! You're Too Late, Bra. I've Already Been Rescued. Oh, Yeah? No More Dumb Stunts, Ok? Promise? Yeah. I'll Get Your Towel. Don't Go Anywhere. I Thought You'd Be On A Plane By Now... Long Gone. Why'd You Come Back? I Just Want To Let You Know... What I Said Before, About Hating You, Hating This Whole Place... I Didn't Mean That. Me, Too. About Kona... What I Let You Think... It Wasn't True. He Really Likes You, Girl. [Laughing] Oh, One More Thing... Ahh...Hey. Hey, Watch That. You All Right? Yeah. What Is It? The Contract. Look, I Didn't Do It. I Didn't Sign. What? Don't You Get It? I Told Them No. We're Not Selling Makai. We're Gonna Live Here. Gia: Yes! Yes! Ow! Ha Ha Ha! Whoo! Yes! Yeah! I Kept Wanting To Stay, And I Am! I Am! Yeah! Have You Decided What You'll Do? Look For A Teaching Job. Finish The Novel. Maybe Open That School Up At The Old Plantation. [Chuckles] I Guess We're Kinda Wide Open. You're Not Sorry About Turning Down All That Money? Yeah. Tsk! Ha Ha! That Was Sydney's Choice. I'm Proud Of Her. I Think She Did The Right Thing. I'm So Glad You Guys Are Here. I'm Not Sure If I'm Saying Hello Or Good-Bye, But I Know She's Out Here, Watching Over Me, And I Know I'll Have That, Always. So, Either Way... It's All The Same. It's All Aloha. Hey, Sydney! Whoo! Over Here! Hey! All Right! [Shutter Clicking] [Click] [Click] [Click] [Click] [Click] [Click] [Click] [Click] Yes!
