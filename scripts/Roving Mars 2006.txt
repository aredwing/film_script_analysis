Was it wet? Could life have existed here? 31 00:43:04,778 -- 00:43:07,713 The key is in the clues, and the clues are in the rocks, 32 00:43:08,315 -- 00:43:11,113 On Earth, a geologist can find an interesting rock, 33 00:43:11,184 -- 00:43:14,210 crack it open with a hammer and just look at what's inside, 34 00:43:14,287 -- 00:43:18,383 But we're not ready to send a human geologist to Mars yet, 35 00:43:23,964 -- 00:43:26,660 So we had to build a robot geologist, 36 00:43:26,733 -- 00:43:30,464 and the only place this could be done was NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, 37 00:43:30,537 -- 00:43:33,938 where some of the most innovative engineers in the country work, 38 00:43:34,007 -- 00:43:37,170 We're talking about a robot, a rover that can go to Mars, 39 00:43:37,244 -- 00:43:42,011 land on the surface, take a look around and then cut the cord and go - 40 00:43:43,250 -- 00:43:46,219 carrying everything it needs with it - 41 00:43:46,286 -- 00:43:51,656 cameras, instruments, communications equipment, everything, 42 00:43:52,592 -- 00:43:58,497 Something that can look inside rocks and can tell us what clues those rocks hold, 43 00:44:05,505 -- 00:44:08,201 This place to me is almost sacred, 44 00:44:08,275 -- 00:44:13,338 This is the place where our rovers are assembled before they leave this planet, 45 00:44:13,413 -- 00:44:17,440 Everything that we do in this room must be perfect, 46 00:44:22,522 -- 00:44:25,491 Over 4,000 people have worked on this mission, 47 00:44:25,559 -- 00:44:29,825 For every single piece of this spacecraft, down to the tiniest one, 48 00:44:29,896 -- 00:44:33,195 there was a person somewhere who conceived it, who nurtured it, 49 00:44:33,266 -- 00:44:36,827 who took it from a concept to something real, 50 00:44:40,106 -- 00:44:44,304 lt's taken this team three years to design and build and test these rovers, 51 00:44:44,377 -- 00:44:46,675 and we still have work to do, 52 00:44:49,850 -- 00:44:52,910 We can only launch when the two planets are properly aligned, 53 00:44:52,986 -- 00:44:56,888 and that's just a month away, but we still have tests to run, 54 00:44:56,957 -- 00:45:02,987 We're working in shifts, almost around the clock, and we don't know if we'll make it, 55 00:45:09,769 -- 00:45:13,364 i( man)/i There's no one person who can get their arms around this thing and say: 56 00:45:13,440 -- 00:45:17,342 ''l understand everything about this vehicle,'' 57 00:45:18,645 -- 00:45:22,012 lt's now burst the bounds of our brains, 58 00:45:24,384 -- 00:45:27,217 This rover is more than just a roving geologist, 59 00:45:27,287 -- 00:45:31,155 This rover also has to be a spacecraft, 60 00:45:31,758 -- 00:45:34,818 lt actually has to fly itself from Earth to Mars, 61 00:45:34,895 -- 00:45:39,423 ln addition, it has to do the very subtle and quick timing control 62 00:45:39,499 -- 00:45:43,833 of all the things that happen as it enters and lands the vehicle, 63 00:45:44,771 -- 00:45:48,263 We had to stuff all that intelligence and capability 64 00:45:48,341 -- 00:45:53,506 into that little six-wheel vehicle back there so that it could get there safely on its own, 65 00:45:56,149 -- 00:45:59,209 i( Manning)/i l call our spacecraft the ''origami spacecraft,'' 66 00:45:59,286 -- 00:46:02,778 which means it's really a complicated series of folds, 67 00:46:02,856 -- 00:46:06,485 We punched holes in the lander petals for the wheels to snake through, 68 00:46:06,559 -- 00:46:09,756 We've had to fold everything into these complicated shapes 69 00:46:09,829 -- 00:46:13,993 to get this system to fit inside this tetrahedron, 70 00:46:17,671 -- 00:46:23,303 lt's beautiful, but at a price, and that price, in this case, is complexity, 71 00:46:26,579 -- 00:46:29,104 i( Squyres)/i There have been missions to Mars since the '60s, 72 00:46:29,182 -- 00:46:33,812 there have been dozens of them, but two-thirds of those missions failed, 73 00:46:33,887 -- 00:46:36,447 Mars is a spacecraft graveyard, 74 00:46:39,759 -- 00:46:44,287 A spacecraft has to travel about 300 million miles to get to Mars 75 00:46:44,364 -- 00:46:46,924 at about 60,000 miles an hour, 76 00:46:47,000 -- 00:46:50,060 but it still takes seven months to get there, 77 00:46:50,136 -- 00:46:52,502 Trying to hit our landing sites from that distance 78 00:46:52,572 -- 00:46:55,473 is like shooting a basketball from Los Angeles to New York 79 00:46:55,542 -- 00:47:00,138 and having it go through the hoop without touching the rim, 80 00:47:05,752 -- 00:47:10,382 The smallest mistake on our part could put the whole mission in jeopardy, 81 00:47:10,457 -- 00:47:14,223 Two of the last three missions to Mars were failures, 82 00:47:14,294 -- 00:47:19,823 One spacecraft burned in the atmosphere, the other one crashed on the surface, 83 00:47:19,899 -- 00:47:22,891 This time, NASA decided to send two identical spacecraft 84 00:47:22,969 -- 00:47:25,494 to double our chances of success, 85 00:47:28,274 -- 00:47:32,176 The two rovers are named ''Spirit'' and ''Opportunity,'' 86 00:47:34,347 -- 00:47:36,178 They have very different personalities, 87 00:47:36,249 -- 00:47:39,650 They did when they were babies, back when we were first building them, 88 00:47:39,719 -- 00:47:42,745 ''Spirit'' was our troublesome firstborn, 89 00:47:42,822 -- 00:47:45,347 Every test we ran, it seemed we ran on ''Spirit'' first, 90 00:47:45,425 -- 00:47:48,223 and the first time you try, it usually doesn't work, 91 00:47:48,294 -- 00:47:50,262 We'd run tests on ''Spirit'' and they'd fail, 92 00:47:50,330 -- 00:47:54,027 and we'd try to fix things, run another test, and that would fail, too, 93 00:47:54,100 -- 00:47:56,933 By the time we got to ''Opportunity,'' we'd learned stuff, 94 00:47:57,003 -- 00:47:59,301 and things went much more smoothly, 95 00:48:16,489 -- 00:48:21,358 The biggest problem was underestimating the size and weight of the rovers, 96 00:48:21,428 -- 00:48:24,363 Once we realized how big they really had to be, 97 00:48:24,431 -- 00:48:27,332 we also realized that the landing system we planned to use 98 00:48:27,400 -- 00:48:31,962 couldn't get them to the ground in one piece, 99 00:48:32,038 -- 00:48:35,735 As the rover got heavier, the lander got heavier, the aeroshell got heavier, 100 00:48:35,809 -- 00:48:38,175 The whole thing got heavier and heavier and heavier, 101 00:48:38,244 -- 00:48:43,113 From the very beginning, on this mission, it seemed like nothing was going right, 102 00:48:43,183 -- 00:48:46,983 i( Squyres)/i The air bags are like the air bags in your car, but way more expensive, 103 00:48:47,053 -- 00:48:53,049 They inflate explosively around the vehicle and they cushion the landing, 104 00:48:54,394 -- 00:48:59,127 The first time we tested them, they tore open and deflated, 105 00:49:01,401 -- 00:49:02,993 Setbacks - we know they are going to happen, 106 00:49:03,069 -- 00:49:06,436 l always tell people, when you start these projects, 107 00:49:06,506 -- 00:49:09,373 the same thing probably happened to Lewis and Clark 108 00:49:09,442 -- 00:49:12,309 and Captain Cook in their exploration - 109 00:49:12,378 -- 00:49:14,608 what is guaranteed is there will be setbacks, 110 00:49:14,681 -- 00:49:18,082 i( man over radio) 3, 2, 1.../i 111 00:49:19,152 -- 00:49:24,146 i( Squyres)/i These rovers have to land using a supersonic parachute, 112 00:49:25,091 -- 00:49:28,549 The parachute design we thought would work ripped to shreds, 113 00:49:28,628 -- 00:49:32,621 The lander had gotten so heavy that the chute just couldn't handle it, 114 00:49:32,699 -- 00:49:35,497 We were practically out of time, and all we had was a chute design 115 00:49:35,568 -- 00:49:38,469 that would destroy the spacecraft when we tried to land, 116 00:49:38,538 -- 00:49:42,497 i( Manning)/i We had to build a whole nother set of new designs - 117 00:49:42,575 -- 00:49:45,135 no less than three or four designs we had to test 118 00:49:45,211 -- 00:49:50,911 in the three months that followed in our mad rush to make it to the launch pad, 119 00:49:51,918 -- 00:49:55,479 We were running out of money, we were running out of time, 120 00:49:57,056 -- 00:50:04,189 The drop was successful, The fact that the parachute exploded - not a good thing, 121 00:50:04,264 -- 00:50:07,961 - l'd rather have it happen here thani,,,/i - Mars, That's right, 122 00:50:08,034 -- 00:50:10,332 Unfortunately, strictly speaking, 123 00:50:10,403 -- 00:50:15,102 that chute that just exploded was the chute that we were planning on taking to Mars, 124 00:50:52,478 -- 00:50:54,969 i( Squyres)/i Mars is a tough place to send a spacecraft, 125 00:50:55,048 -- 00:50:57,812 The average temperature is 60 degrees below zero, 126 00:50:57,884 -- 00:51:01,081 lt goes down to 1 00 below zero at night, 127 00:51:01,154 -- 00:51:05,090 There can be dust storms that darken the skies for months at a time, 128 00:51:05,158 -- 00:51:07,888 But if the rovers make it, they'll give us the experience 129 00:51:07,961 -- 00:51:10,521 of what it would be like to be on Mars, 130 00:51:10,597 -- 00:51:14,397 We'll be able to look off into the distance and say, ''Yeah, l'd like to go there,'' 131 00:51:14,467 -- 00:51:18,028 and then actually go and see what we find, 132 00:51:27,447 -- 00:51:30,075 The rover's arm has the same dimensions of a human arm - 133 00:51:30,149 -- 00:51:32,549 with a shoulder, an elbow and a wrist, 134 00:51:32,652 -- 00:51:36,213 The arm tucks up tight under the front of the vehicle for when we drive around, 135 00:51:36,289 -- 00:51:38,553 but when we get to a rock that we want to examine, 136 00:51:38,625 -- 00:51:43,653 the arm unstows and reaches out, using all of its joints 137 00:51:43,730 -- 00:51:47,666 to place the instruments on a rock and to begin to study them, 138 00:51:51,137 -- 00:51:54,664 The hand has four fingers, One is a microscope, 139 00:51:54,741 -- 00:51:58,609 two are spectrometers to tell us in detail what the rocks are made of, 140 00:51:58,678 -- 00:52:03,342 and the fourth one is called the RAT - the Rock Abrasion Tool, 141 00:52:09,956 -- 00:52:14,256 To examine the rocks, we've got to get to them, and Mars is very bumpy, 142 00:52:14,327 -- 00:52:19,731 So to deal with bumps, engineers came up with a ''rocker-bogie'' suspension system, 143 00:52:19,799 -- 00:52:22,825 lt's a very clever design that allows each of the six wheels 144 00:52:22,902 -- 00:52:28,534 to go up and over a rock independently while the rover itself hardly tilts at all, 145 00:52:33,446 -- 00:52:36,938 OK, come on in, guys, Now, stay clear, Watch it, watch it, 146 00:52:37,016 -- 00:52:40,782 Stay clear of this, 'cause it's gonna move, Watch the wheelsi,,,/i 147 00:52:40,853 -- 00:52:43,014 i( Squyres)/i lt goes way beyond this single mission, 148 00:52:43,089 -- 00:52:45,751 The eventual goal is to send humans to Mars, 149 00:52:45,825 -- 00:52:49,522 but the first person to walk on Mars is not an astronaut today, 150 00:52:49,595 -- 00:52:53,031 lt's someone in high school or in elementary school, 151 00:52:53,099 -- 00:52:56,296 i( man)/i So it's turning in place, then, when it gets lined up just right, 152 00:52:56,369 -- 00:52:58,394 we're gonna drive it backwards, 153 00:53:04,644 -- 00:53:07,909 i( Squyres)/i We've invested so much work, so many years, 154 00:53:07,980 -- 00:53:12,349 so much of our hopes and our dreams into these rovers, 155 00:53:12,418 -- 00:53:15,353 And then when you think about where they're going, 156 00:53:15,421 -- 00:53:19,221 the ride they're gonna get on that rocket, the transit through space, 157 00:53:19,292 -- 00:53:21,590 what it's like when that parachute goes out at mach 2, 158 00:53:21,661 -- 00:53:25,324 going through the Martian atmosphere, 159 00:53:32,405 -- 00:53:34,270 You're standing next to this little robot 160 00:53:34,340 -- 00:53:39,573 and you realize it's gonna spend eternity on the surface of another world, 161 00:53:39,645 -- 00:53:42,637 lt's going to another planet, for real, 162 00:53:46,786 -- 00:53:48,777 And once they're gone, that's it, 163 00:53:48,855 -- 00:53:53,292 After the rovers launch, we're never gonna see them again with our own eyes, 164 00:53:53,359 -- 00:53:57,921 We've done everything we can to prepare them for the dangers they'll have to face, 165 00:53:57,997 -- 00:54:01,364 but it's gonna be very hard to say goodbye, 166 00:54:03,403 -- 00:54:05,394 i(wind machine)/i 167 00:55:20,680 -- 00:55:26,141 ''Spirit'' will be launched first, then ''Opportunity'' three weeks later, 168 00:55:26,219 -- 00:55:28,244 Mars and Earth are both orbiting the sun, 169 00:55:28,321 -- 00:55:32,018 so they're always moving relative to each other, 170 00:55:32,091 -- 00:55:34,150 Every 26 months, there's a brief interval 171 00:55:34,227 -- 00:55:37,196 when the planets are lined up just right, 172 00:55:37,263 -- 00:55:42,428 At that time, and only at that time, we have enough rocket fuel to make it, 173 00:55:42,502 -- 00:55:44,970 So this is our one shot, 174 00:55:45,037 -- 00:55:47,870 i(launch alarm blaring)/i 175

00:57:52,096 We just place the spacecraft on a trajectory to Mars, 178 00:57:52,164 -- 00:57:55,725 and let it coast for 7 months and 300 million miles 179 00:57:55,801 -- 00:57:58,964 until it reaches the planet, 180 00:57:59,038 -- 00:58:02,474 Once it's been pushed on its way to Mars by the launch vehicle, 181 00:58:02,541 -- 00:58:06,307 it has to maintain its orientation toward the sun 182 00:58:06,379 -- 00:58:09,678 and it needs to be able to correct its orientation and direction 183 00:58:09,749 -- 00:58:17,087 so that it would hit Mars and get to this very tiny spot on Mars we're aiming for, 184 00:58:17,156 -- 00:58:21,684 So all that has to take place over the course of the seven-month journey, 185 00:58:49,689 -- 00:58:52,715 i( Manning)/i Landing is when the real challenge begins, 186 00:58:52,792 -- 00:58:55,192 Mars is so far away, it takes about ten minutes 187 00:58:55,261 -- 00:58:59,197 for a radio signal to travel one way between Mars and Earth, 188 00:58:59,265 -- 00:59:03,065 but it's only six minutes from when we first hit the top of the Martian atmosphere 189 00:59:03,135 -- 00:59:05,660 to when we're bouncing on the surface, 190 00:59:05,738 -- 00:59:10,232 There's nothing we can do to help when it's time to land, The rovers are on their own, 191 00:59:10,309 -- 00:59:13,073 and we're just passive, passionately interested observers 192 00:59:13,145 -- 00:59:18,811 waiting for a radio signal that shows whether or not they've survived, 193 00:59:21,787 -- 00:59:24,847 Not going to be an issue, The current reported temperature 194 00:59:24,924 -- 00:59:29,520 is about zero degrees Celsius, which is close to the limit, 195 00:59:29,595 -- 00:59:31,460 the flight-allowable limit, howeveri,,,/i 196 00:59:31,530 -- 00:59:33,691 i( man)/i Landing on Mars is so complicated, 197 00:59:33,766 -- 00:59:35,893 There are so many things that can go wrong, 198 00:59:35,968 -- 00:59:40,029 The flight computer has to know precisely the right time to deploy the parachute, 199 00:59:40,106 -- 00:59:42,700 lf it deploys it too high, when the parachute opens, 200 00:59:42,775 -- 00:59:45,107 the wind forces will just rip it to shreds, 201 00:59:45,177 -- 00:59:47,805 lf we deploy the parachute too low of an altitude, 202 00:59:47,880 -- 00:59:51,509 it won't open in time, and it will just crash right into the ground, 203 00:59:53,419 -- 00:59:56,513 i( Squyres)/i The trick is every time there's some critical event - 204 00:59:56,589 -- 00:59:59,319 the parachute deploys, the heat shield falls away - 205 00:59:59,391 -- 01:00:01,621 we change the frequency of the radio signal, 206 01:00:01,694 -- 01:00:03,719 And so Polly's sitting at her console, 207 01:00:03,796 -- 01:00:06,526 and she's looking for these changing frequencies, 208 01:00:06,599 -- 01:00:10,865 And when the number changes, she knows that this event has happened, 209 01:00:10,936 -- 01:00:14,428 that event has happened, 210 01:00:15,808

01:04:35,434 -- 01:04:39,564 After that, we can deploy the camera mast so the rover can see, 246 01:04:39,638 -- 01:04:43,574 and deploy the antenna so the rover can talk to us, 247 01:04:58,190 --

250 01:05:28,520 -- 01:05:30,351 i(woman)/i Oh! 251 01:05:48,373 -- 01:05:54,676 We could not have imagined returns as early as this, 252 01:05:54,746 -- 01:05:59,183 as clear as this, as successful as this, 253 01:05:59,251 -- 01:06:02,687 and in the volume that it has been, 254 01:06:02,754 -- 01:06:05,279 Ladies and gentlemen, Mars, 255 01:06:25,277 -- 01:06:27,609 i( Squyres)/i We sent ''Spirit'' to Gusev Crater, 256 01:06:27,679 -- 01:06:29,977 a crater in the southern highlands of Mars, 257 01:06:30,048 -- 01:06:32,175 lt's 1 00 miles in diameter, 258 01:06:32,251 -- 01:06:36,813 What makes it special is that emptying into it is a giant water-carved channel, 259 01:06:36,889 -- 01:06:39,858 Gusev is a hole in the ground with a dry river flowing into it, 260 01:06:39,925 -- 01:06:43,884 There has to have been a lake in this crater once upon a time, 261 01:06:43,962 -- 01:06:48,126 We sent ''Spirit'' there to seek out sediments, to look for sedimentary rocks 262 01:06:48,200 -- 01:06:52,432 that were laid down long ago in that lake, 263 01:06:52,504 -- 01:06:54,768 Once we landed, the scariest part of the mission 264 01:06:54,840 -- 01:06:58,037 was the initial unfolding of the rover, 265 01:07:04,016 -- 01:07:08,043 There are so many gears and springs and motors and hinges and latches 266 01:07:08,120 -- 01:07:11,681 that have to work just right, or you're done, 267 01:07:21,466 -- 01:07:24,526 Once everything's deployed, we're ready to start looking around, 268 01:07:24,603 -- 01:07:28,699 We can look off into the distance with our cameras and our infrared spectrometer, 269 01:07:28,774 -- 01:07:32,676 and we can learn a lot from a distance of i5/i0 yards, 1 00 yards, 270 01:07:32,744 -- 01:07:35,645 about what the rocks look like and what they're made of, 271 01:07:35,714 -- 01:07:38,547 Then, if we see a rock that has a texture or a composition 272 01:07:38,617 -- 01:07:44,613 that looks interesting to us, we can drive over to it and check it out in detail, 273 01:07:52,064 -- 01:07:55,033 For driving, the rover has these kind of googly-eyed cameras 274 01:07:55,100 -- 01:07:58,399 that it uses to take images of the terrain in front of it, 275 01:07:58,470 -- 01:08:03,305 They've got wide-angle lenses, and they provide sort of a fisheye view, 276 01:08:03,375 -- 01:08:08,711 ''Spirit'' uses these pictures to make its own decisions about how to drive, 277 01:08:08,780 -- 01:08:12,682 lt'll drive forward, look at a rock and say, ''That's too big, l have to go around that,'' 278 01:08:12,751 -- 01:08:16,778 Or maybe it'll see smooth sailing and just move on, 279 01:08:16,855 -- 01:08:21,155 We can actually program different levels of courage or cowardice into the rover, 280 01:08:21,226 -- 01:08:27,426 telling it how aggressive to be, depending on how dangerous we think the terrain is, 281 01:08:27,499 -- 01:08:33,096 These rovers are so complicated that it takes hours to get a set of commands right, 282 01:08:33,171 -- 01:08:38,131 so when we operate them, we'll normally send commands to them just once a day, 283 01:08:38,210 -- 01:08:40,371 The first rock that we looked at was this one, 284 01:08:40,445 -- 01:08:43,107 We named it Adirondack, 285 01:08:43,181 -- 01:08:45,411 When a rock sits on the surface of a planet, 286 01:08:45,484 -- 01:08:47,543 it can undergo what's called ''weathering,'' 287 01:08:47,619 -- 01:08:50,110 When it's exposed to sunlight or humidity or wind, 288 01:08:50,188 -- 01:08:52,156 the surface of the rock can be modified, 289 01:08:52,224 -- 01:08:54,692 and the evidence of how it formed can be destroyed, 290 01:08:54,760 -- 01:08:56,751 So, to get to the clues you need, 291 01:08:56,828 -- 01:09:01,959 you have to get inside the rock, below the weathered surface, 292 01:09:02,034 -- 01:09:05,561 The key to understanding Adirondack was the Rock Abrasion Tool, 293 01:09:05,637 -- 01:09:08,868 The RAT gives us the ability to grind into a rock, 294 01:09:08,940 -- 01:09:12,307 exposing the unaltered evidence inside, 295 01:09:23,555 -- 01:09:28,356 So we put a RAT hole into Adirondack and then we hit it with everything we had, 296 01:09:28,427 -- 01:09:32,727 We looked at it with our cameras, our spectrometers, and our microscope, 297 01:09:32,798 -- 01:09:36,564 Adirondack is a piece of lava, lt's not a sedimentary rock, 298 01:09:36,635 -- 01:09:40,264 And every other rock around it is a piece of lava, too, 299 01:09:40,339 -- 01:09:42,534 This was a huge disappointment, 300 01:09:42,607 -- 01:09:45,132 We came to Gusev Crater looking for sediments 301 01:09:45,210 -- 01:09:47,678 that were laid down long ago in a lake, 302 01:09:47,746 -- 01:09:51,273 but what we found was lava - volcanic rock, 303 01:09:51,350 -- 01:09:55,411 The sedimentary rock must be there, but it's been buried under the lava, 304 01:09:55,487 -- 01:09:58,217 and we couldn't get to it, 305 01:09:58,290 -- 01:10:01,487 When we realized that we hadn't landed on the stuff we came for, 306 01:10:01,560 -- 01:10:03,960 we decided we had to go someplace else, 307 01:10:04,029 -- 01:10:07,260 A mile and a half away, there's this spectacular range of hills 308 01:10:07,332 -- 01:10:09,493 called the Columbia Hills, 309 01:10:09,568 -- 01:10:14,972 You gotta remember ''Spirit'' was designed to go only 600 yards over its lifetime, 310 01:10:15,407 -- 01:10:20,208 so we set out for those hills not knowing if we'd ever make it, 311 01:10:21,446 -- 01:10:26,907 Meanwhile, on the other side of Mars, ''Opportunity'' was about to land, 312 01:10:51,343 -- 01:10:53,470 When ''Opportunity'' landed at Eagle Crater, 313 01:10:53,545 -- 01:10:58,107 it was a 300 million-mile interplanetary hole in one, 314 01:10:59,885 -- 01:11:03,377 We rolled to a stop right in front of layered bedrock, 315 01:11:03,455 -- 01:11:05,821 Bedrock is geologic truth, 316 01:11:05,891 -- 01:11:10,328 ''Opportunity'' landed in front of a Martian history book, 317 01:11:16,101 -- 01:11:19,161 When we drove off the lander and looked at the soil in front of us, 318 01:11:19,237 -- 01:11:23,173 we saw that it was littered with what looked like little round beads, 319 01:11:23,241 -- 01:11:27,177 an uncountable number of little round things, 320 01:11:27,245 -- 01:11:31,682 We took out our microscope, we reached out and looked at the soil in detail, 321 01:11:31,750 -- 01:11:34,446 and the picture that came down was astounding, 322 01:11:34,519 -- 01:11:37,010 They were perfect spheres, 323 01:11:37,088 -- 01:11:40,148 l will remember for the rest of my life 324 01:11:40,225 -- 01:11:43,626 how l felt when l saw that first picture, 325 01:11:50,435 -- 01:11:52,699 When we got to the outcrop and looked at it up close, 326 01:11:52,771 -- 01:11:56,400 we realized that the spheres are embedded in the rock 327 01:11:56,475 -- 01:11:58,636 like blueberries in a muffin, 328 01:11:58,710 -- 01:12:03,079 The rock erodes away and the blueberries fall out and roll down into the soil, 329 01:12:06,218 -- 01:12:08,277 The blueberries are made of hematite, 330 01:12:08,353 -- 01:12:12,813 a mineral that on Earth is often formed in liquid water, 331 01:12:12,891 -- 01:12:16,327 Next we found jarosite, which is a mineral that couldn't have formed 332 01:12:16,394 -- 01:12:22,094 unless there'd been water in the rocks, so there was water underground here, 333 01:12:22,167 -- 01:12:26,228 Our most extraordinary discovery came when we found ripples in the rocks, 334 01:12:26,304 -- 01:12:31,901 ancient ripples formed when water flowed over sand on Mars billions of years ago, 335 01:12:31,977 -- 01:12:34,241 So there wasn't just water underground here, 336 01:12:34,312 -- 01:12:37,304 there was water at the surface, 337 01:12:41,119 -- 01:12:44,520 ''Opportunity'' discovered that at this place billions of years ago, 338 01:12:44,589 -- 01:12:47,649 Mars was most likely a habitable world, 339 01:12:47,726 -- 01:12:52,459 A place that, for some interval of time, was suitable for some forms of life, 340 01:12:52,531 -- 01:12:56,023 Decades of work paid off with this discovery, 341 01:12:57,536 -- 01:13:01,996 Billions of years ago, there were shallow occasional pools of water, 342 01:13:02,073 -- 01:13:05,133 Don't think an ocean, Think of salt flats, 343 01:13:05,210 -- 01:13:07,610 And the water may not have been a pretty blue, 344 01:13:07,679 -- 01:13:11,046 ln fact, it may have been so acid, it dissolved iron out of the rocks 345 01:13:11,116 -- 01:13:15,177 and made wine-red pools under a pink Martian sky, 346 01:13:31,503 -- 01:13:34,267 All the discoveries that ''Opportunity'' made about water 347 01:13:34,339 -- 01:13:37,103 happened in the first six weeks of the mission, 348 01:13:37,175 -- 01:13:39,541 Everything went right for that rover, 349 01:13:39,611 -- 01:13:42,171 l call ''Opportunity'' ''Little Miss Perfect,'' 350 01:13:42,247 -- 01:13:45,239 ''Opportunity'' lands where the evidence is right there, 351 01:13:45,317 -- 01:13:49,014 The driving is like a parking lot, Everything is perfect, 352 01:13:52,223 -- 01:13:55,624 ''Spirit,'' our kind of tough, hard-working, blue-collar rover, 353 01:13:55,694 -- 01:13:59,130 lands in this awful, rocky, rugged place on a lava plain 354 01:13:59,197 -- 01:14:02,223 a mile and a half from the nearest interesting rocks 355 01:14:02,300 -- 01:14:07,203 and has to struggle for five months just to begin her mission, 356 01:14:08,974 -- 01:14:14,412 ''Spirit'' had to work for everything, literally had to climb a mountain on Mars, 357 01:14:16,281 -- 01:14:18,408 We use the power that comes from the sun 358 01:14:18,483 -- 01:14:20,917 to operate the vehicle and to charge the batteries, 359 01:14:20,986 -- 01:14:23,648 so the solar arrays are essential, 360 01:14:23,722 -- 01:14:28,091 On the way to the Columbia Hills, ''Spirit's'' solar arrays got coated with dust, 361 01:14:28,159 -- 01:14:32,255 We were getting to the point where ''Spirit'' was simply gonna die, 362 01:14:32,330 -- 01:14:36,528 Then, one wonderful day, we climbed up onto the crest of a ridge, 363 01:14:36,601 -- 01:14:39,695 where we were hit by not one but several gusts of wind 364 01:14:39,771 -- 01:14:42,331 that just cleaned the solar arrays off, 365 01:14:42,407 -- 01:14:46,036 lt was like having a brand-new rover, 366 01:14:46,111 -- 01:14:48,272 ''Spirit'' got high up in the Columbia Hills 367 01:14:48,346 -- 01:14:51,941 and started to find stuff that was different from anything we'd seen, 368 01:14:52,017 -- 01:14:57,011 There were salt deposits in the hills and rocks that had been altered by water, 369 01:14:57,088 -- 01:15:00,546 lt took months of work and struggle, but ''Spirit'' finally showed us 370 01:15:00,625 -- 01:15:03,185 there had been water on both sides of the planet, 371 01:15:03,261 -- 01:15:05,889 She gave us exactly what we needed, 372 01:15:09,768 -- 01:15:12,601 These rovers were designed to last only 90 Mars days, 373 01:15:12,671 -- 01:15:14,935 and they've already done many times that, 374 01:15:15,006 -- 01:15:18,305 They've developed personalities, They're workhorses, They say: 375 01:15:18,376 -- 01:15:21,709 ''Push us, Ask us to do more, We can go further, We can go faster,'' 376 01:15:21,780 -- 01:15:24,715 So we ask so much more than they were ever intended to, 377 01:15:24,783 -- 01:15:27,377 and to our amazement, they do it, 378 01:15:30,722 -- 01:15:34,590 We don't know what will kill these rovers, They do get old, Motors break, 379 01:15:34,659 -- 01:15:38,117 Lubrication goes away in the motors, the wheels may stop turning, 380 01:15:38,196 -- 01:15:40,790 We have no idea what will happen, 381 01:15:45,070 -- 01:15:48,938 But they're not gonna last forever, and as the dust keeps falling, 382 01:15:49,007 -- 01:15:51,237 the solar arrays keep getting dirty, 383 01:15:51,309 -- 01:15:55,075 What could happen with time is someday we won't be able to charge the batteries 384 01:15:55,146 -- 01:16:00,140 to keep the rover warm at night, and if that happens, it'll get too cold, 385 01:16:00,218 -- 01:16:03,346 and one morning, it just won't wake up, 386 01:16:10,495 -- 01:16:13,396 ''Spirit'' and ''Opportunity'' have shown us that once, 387 01:16:13,465 -- 01:16:18,528 three to four billion years ago, Mars had the essential ingredients for life, 388 01:16:18,603 -- 01:16:22,130 so the next step is to seek out evidence of life itself, 389 01:16:22,207 -- 01:16:26,166 Right now we have one example of life - us, 390 01:16:26,244 -- 01:16:30,146 We may be all there is, We simply don't know, 391 01:16:30,215 -- 01:16:34,242 But if you can show that life developed twice in one solar system, 392 01:16:34,319 -- 01:16:37,914 and then you consider the multitude of solar systems out there, 393 01:16:37,989 -- 01:16:42,085 it takes no great leap of imagination to believe that life might be 394 01:16:42,160 -- 01:16:45,926 a common phenomenon throughout the universe, 395 01:16:52,270 -- 01:16:55,205 Our rovers have gone farther, harder and longer 396 01:16:55,273 -- 01:16:58,868 than even we, their creators, believed possible, 397 01:16:58,943 -- 01:17:01,377 They've done heroic work, 398 01:17:02,947 -- 01:17:06,041 But someday we won't need robots, 399 01:17:06,117 -- 01:17:09,280 Someday there'll be humans on the surface of Mars, 400 01:17:09,354 -- 01:17:12,846 and boot prints in our wheel tracks, 401 01:17:20,031 -- 01:17:22,556 This mission has put us on a great trajectory 402 01:17:22,634 -- 01:17:27,162 to learn more about Mars and about ourselves, 403 01:17:27,238 -- 01:17:32,540 But right now ''Spirit'' and ''Opportunity'' are still roving Mars, 404 01:17:32,610 -- 01:17:35,443 lt's not just that they've exceeded our wildest dreams - 405 01:17:35,513 -- 01:17:38,880 in many ways they iare/i our wildest dreams,
