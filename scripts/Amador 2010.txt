Hold still. Let him go! He's one of your own! He ain't nothir of mine, asshole! - You give my country a bad name. - Sell out! Help a brother out! If you got up at 2 A.M. Like me, you wouldn't need any help! No wonder your wife sleeps around. You work so much you forgot how to be a man! Say that to my face, asshole! You see? I knew I'd seen that rent-a-cop's face before. That lady I told you about had his photo in her bedroom. Who do you think the flowers are for, dickhead? Fucking scum. They'll get theirs. Always giving us a hard time. Those bastards haven't heard the last of me. "My dearest Nelson: I don't know how to say this, but I can't..." "We used to hold each other to keep warm. I came to this place to find what was best for us. That's what you said." You see it? That's the heart. It had to be now... It's been in there a few weeks now. Have you had any interruptions? Two years ago. Everything is normal, Marcela. Does it look like me? It's still too early to know. I need your info to schedule an appointment, Marcela. Tell me where you live. Where do you live, Marcela? Where are you, Marcela? MARCELA One, two, sixteen. Six are missing. That's sixteen, six are missing. Not the white ones. The white ones go over there. Those are red, sixteen red ones. These make eight. Two bundles, six missing. You gave me ten euros. You're six euros short. Sixteen for two bundles. How are you feeling? My stomach hurts. Have you eaten? You're not going out today. You're staying home. - Hi, Nelson. - Hi. You're late. Marcela got the flowers ready, they're in the fridge. - Hi. - Hi, Marcela. How's your mom? Fine, she said to say hi. She says you haven't been to see her at the restaurant for a while. It's almost full, Nelson. We need to be ready for the holidays. Gladis is always ready for the holidays. Marcela isn't feeling well. You two have to sell her share. Have you got the six euros or not? Ever seen one like this? Look, this one is selling very well lately. Automatic defrost and door alarm. It beeps if you leave it open. You like it? With financing it costs 450. in installments. Okay. We haven't got that much. It's only 150. But we have to pay it off. We haven't got that either. You could get a summer job. What about that job Rosa mentioned? Not now, Nelson. - We can't. - Why not? Now is when we need it. It's almost Christmas. Our stash has already wilted. Beside, we owe three months rent. - We don't have any money. - We'll find some. You see? It beeps. He just needs a little help. Someone to keep him company. Have you ever done this before? No. Don't worry, I won't ask for any qualifications. We don't think training is really necessary. He was fine until recently. Just one month, to try it out. Every day. See if you two get along, eh? We'll pay you at the end of the month. 500 euros. Yeah, 500 is the going rate. We can give you a hundred up front. We'll wire it to you after the first week. He doesn't talk or complain much. He won't give you much work. He's an easy man. Daddy wants to know if you'll be much longer. Tell Daddy we're almost done, okay? Now run along. My secretary. Have you got children, Marcela? No. They bring a lot of joy, but they're also a lot of work. I'm sure you'll get along just fine. We can't take care of him right now. We're building a house out of town, you know what building is like. His medication is very simple. Just pills. It's all written down right here. Dosage, hours... When he runs out, the pharmacy will give you more. Just say they're for him. They know us, we have an account with them. I'll give you my phone number in case you need anything. I'll call you from time to time. We have to get going or we'll get caught in traffic. Did I tell you his name? Can you make it 150? The advance. Yeah. Sure. Good morning. It isn't much. They're giving me an advance. It's just enough for the first installment on the fridge. We can pick it up on Saturday. I'll ask Oscar for his truck. Spray this on them. Is he a nice old man? Why do we have to spray the flowers? So they smell like flowers. Otherwise they don't. Flowers don't smell like flowers? Exactly. It makes me dizzy. I like it. It's from natural flowers. I still don't get it. People like flowers to smell good, Marcela. Why all the questions? Who's the expert here? And who found a job to pay for the fridge? You, my love. When we have our own flower shop I'll name it after you. "Marcela's Flowers." I'll put it on the delivery trucks too. On the delivery trucks? We'll do okay. For everyone to see. You've put on weight. A little. What's your name? Marcela. Amador. Want me to put him on? Okay, ma'am. Don't worry. Your father is resting right now. Don't worry, he'll understand. I'll explain it to him. Okay. I'll say hello to him for you. I will, okay. Bye. The sea is the hardest. It's all the same. Is there sea where you're from? Is that why you left? Well done. The sky is hard too. You've got sky there, right? Sky, yes. Do you like clouds? You know what a friend of mine used to say? That God made clouds so he could hide behind them when he's ashamed of something. How about that? Of course my friend was an anarchist. What else would he say? Well? Was the father happy? What did he say? That I've put on weight. Have you got the next size up? You don't want to watch the soap opera? I don't watch series'. You don't like them? They last too long. Of course. You haven't got time. You're so busy. They're series'. They last. Have you ever done a puzzle? Never? No. I don't see why they go to all the trouble of breaking a photo into little pieces. Why not just buy it with the pieces already in place? Then it wouldn't be a puzzle. The photo would be the same. It's not the same. The photo is. Yeah, but then I wouldn't have done it. You'd save yourself all that work. The final result is the same. It's the same, but different too. Because if you do it yourself, it comes out differently. Puzzles and other stuff too. Everything. It happens in life too. Before you're born, you're given all the pieces. You don't know you have them, but they've been given to you and it's your job to put them all together. That's life. Putting all the pieces in the right place. It's as simple as that. Nobody gave me any pieces. Yes, they did. You just don't know it. But you have all the pieces. It's your responsibility to find out where each one goes. Wiring money is cheap, fast and safe. Send as much as you want to South America for only 4,50 euros... We bring people closer. Is he okay? Amador. You're looking after him, right? He's fine. Who are you? Marcela. Amador? He's in his room. I'm a friend of his. I come every Thursday. He didn't tell you? He's very discreet. What do you do? I look after him. Just like me. But only on Thursdays. I only take an hour with him. An hour? More or less. That's about how long it takes, one hour. Every Thursday. I need to renew my residency in February... If you need to consult a lawyer about immigration or residency requirements... All set. Already? What was your name, sweetie? - Marcela. - Marcela. See you next Thursday, Marcela. I'll be back around the same time. You'd better not say anything to my daughter. She doesn't know her. She wouldn't understand. Don't worry. In her own way, Puri... is a mermaid. If your friend is gone, no flowers. Or pay me what he owes me. Tell your friend to come talk to me. They put make-up on you when you die. Right, Marcela? So you look pretty when you reach heaven. It's for the funeral. And so you look pretty for the man upstairs. Flowers are the only thing in the world that stay pretty after they die. Did Nelson tell you that? - Leave the flowers. - Don't touch me! Leave the flowers and get out. Come back when your friend pays me what he owes me! Go on, beat it! Get out. Goodbye. Black bastard. Playing the immigrant with me... You got a letter? Want me to read it to you? It's private. Okay. Have you got a boyfriend? That's private too, like your letter. You don't have one. I don't? I can tell. How can you tell I don't have one, - may I ask? - Because he never calls you. He doesn't call because he doesn't want to bother you. Go figure. You're the one he'd be bothering. A girl used to come in the mornings. Her boyfriend called all the time. Let's meet tonight. And you'd better look sharp if you're coming to see me. Will you take me dancing? No. No. Because I said no. Why do you always say that when you want something from me? If you want me to answer that, first you have to take me dancing. Then we'll see. I said, we'll see. Did the telephone bother you? Did someone call? You didn't hear? Was it my daughter? This is a good time to send money, right? The exchange rate is still going up... You're pregnant. What will you name it? I don't know. It needs to have a name. Can I touch it? Can I talk to it? Just something short. Hey, you, whatever your name is. You're too late. We're going to miss each other. There's no room for anyone else out here. But I'm leaving and you can have my spot. Your mother will save it for you. It's yours, don't forget. Don't let anyone take it from you. This is for you. Here's the money they wired you. It'll work out, you'll see. We'll be able to make plans. Plans? Yeah, plans. People make plans, don't they? Travel, move somewhere better, have a baby... I don't mean now, but in a year or two. When things are better, right? You always said you wanted to. And you always said you didn't. I never said I didn't. Two years ago you did. Because the timing wasrt right. With no money and where we live. There's no room. There's room to sell flowers. There has to be. I can't sell them in the street. You know that, Marcela. Don't make me explain it to you. How do you imagine life, Nelson? Life? Yeah, life. The things yet to come. How things will be. I don't mean next month or the month after that. I mean our life together. Have you ever tried to imagine it? Close your eyes and see it? Because I can't. I try, but I can't, Nelson. I close my eyes and I can't see anything. We need to save a little more, right? We're better off than last year. That isn't saying much. Gladis said you gave them the night off. Yeah, we gave them the night off to see their boyfriends. I think I prefer them working. Did you see them? The mermaids. That one came first by herself. She makes sure it's time and then calls the others, who come later. All I see is a girl in a wheelchair. Yeah. Right. In a wheelchair. Did you get up by yourself? Then how did you see her? I didn't see her. I felt her presence. Her presence. You shouldn't get up by yourself, Amador. Tell me. - That's why I'm here. - I didn't get up. Can you see her legs? They're covered. There you have it. What do I have? Those aren't legs under there. Then what are they? Where I'm from we call that seeing Blue Devils. That's right, I forgot you don't have the sea there. How the hell can you tell a mermaid from a gimp with no sea? We don't have the sea but we have crazy people too. - Because of the altitude. - You only believe in what you see. That's the problem. Who do you mean by "we"? Women, or people in my country? People in your country and women too. Now you'll say we're here to take work away from you. Of course you are. But that's fine with me. Work was created by bosses and they create nothing good. They create job openings. You've got it backwards. The workers are the ones who create boss openings. They've fooled everyone. - Who's fooled everyone? - The media. You call that old TV set media? You can barely see it. That's not media. Besides, you always talk like that. Like you're the only one who sees things as they are. You shouldn't generalize like that. It's wrong to generalize. Saying "it's wrong to generalize" is also generalizing. What should I do with this? Anything but read it. If it were for you I'd have left it open. Why are you back so early? What are you doing here? You're early. What happened? - We need to talk. - Not now, my love. It's important, Nelson. - Hold on. - What for, Nelson? - What's going on? - Take it easy. What do you mean, take it easy? Why can't I come in? We have something important to show you. You caught us. We wanted to surprise you. With your old man we can afford it. It has an icebox, you see? And it beeps if you leave it open. The girls promised to sell all of them. Fany! She'll be ecstatic, you'll see! Fany! I told you I'd fill it, didn't I? Are you okay? Wait, I'll be right down! MARCELA'S FLOWERS Those are pretty high scores to begin with. Good luck to both of you. Let's see what happens... MARCELA'S FLOWERS Hello? Yes, ma'am. Everything's fine. Everything's fine, ma'am. Your father is asleep right now. He's resting. He hasn't had much of an appetite. Probably because it's so hot. Okay. Okay, ma'am. Don't worry, he's fine. All right... I'll tell him. Okay, I'll tell him. Okay. Okay, ma'am. You need to take care of yourself, Marcela. Get plenty of rest and don't do anything that might harm the fetus. Don't over-exert yourself or lift anything heavy. Avoid worrying, stress... anything that might affect it. Are you sleeping well? Spend as much time in bed as you can. I'll give you something for your stomach. Have you felt nauseous? Thank you. How far along are you? Three months. Have you named it yet? There's still time, right? Shall I give you Amador's pills? He must have run out by now. When did I give you the other box? Let me see... The box was 24 pills. What is he taking, six a day? He must have run out by now. Yes, he ran out. Give me another box, please. And the ones for his blood pressure. He must have run out of those too. Is he all right? Say hi to him for us. And tell him we already gave his bathroom scale away. Will you tell him? - Sure. - We gave it away. He knows already. Don't forget. Get your fans ready because it's gonna get hotter. Tomorrow will probably be the hottest day of the summer with temperatures reaching between Keep plenty of water handy... For a little more you can take this one. It rotates, in case you need to move around the room. Will you be moving around? Hello? Hello, ma'am. No, no, everything's fine. Everything's fine, ma'am. I just had a question. A favor to ask. A favor. If it would be possible to pay me the rest sooner. The money for the rest of the month. I had a problem. I had a problem and I need the money. Yeah. Yeah. I understand. Don't worry, ma'am. I'll figure something out. He's doing fine. He's asleep right now. He said the Jaguars are playing. They play great cumbia. A little dancing would be nice, wouldn't it? He said there's a raffle after. I can't, Nelson. I have to go to Amador's. It's just one day, Marcela. What will happen? It's a party. You'll be selling. I'm not working. I gave the girls the night off. We're just gonna have fun. I can't, Nelson. I have to go to Amador's. Can't the old man be by himself for one day? What will happen, will he die? Will he tell his daughter you werert there? I'll go over there with you after and explain it to him. Excuse me? What a question! You can't ask a girl that, Amador. White roses, yellow and tinted. They used to come from Holland, but not anymore. Now everything sold around here comes from Colombia and Ecuador. The roses last ten or twelve days. You can insure the merchandise. I'm bringing flowers from there now too. Is it going well? People buy flowers? Look, there are only three things that matter in life. Three. Love, life and death. And all three are celebrated with flowers. At weddings, when babies are born and when people die. And that will never stop. People will always be born, they'll die, and in between they'll just keep fucking. Like your restaurant. How are things with the old man, Marcela? Does he give you much work? No, normal, I guess. Don't ask her about the old man. She'll rush off to be with him. She loves him more than me. You give her more work, Nelson. She left him alone and she's worried his daughter will turn up. She never visits him and she thinks she'll show up today... If you don't know, why are you talking? - You told me. - No, I didn't. Don't make stuff up. They're at the beach, they won't come. Relax. Just shut up, Nelson. Is it Thursday already? I didn't know what to do. If I tell them I'll lose my job and I need the money. That happened to me once too. With a customer. He died right in the middle of it. At his house. I left without telling anyone. What was I supposed to do? Call his wife? What a mess, huh? Lmagine it. But I didn't take his money or anything. Just the 30 euros for my services. I have my honor. Too soon, damn it. What's the big hurry? Why couldn't he hang on a little longer? He left me out of a job. Nobody should do that. It isn't right. It isn't right, that's true. You make 30 euros for one hour? You think that's a lot? It's more than I make in a whole day. A whole day doing nothing, sweetie. My job needs skills and yours doesn't. - You make good money? - I used to. Not anymore. Girls from your country have hurt us a lot. They've taken all the work. Women my age only have the customers who knew us from before. Did you two know each other a long time? Four or five years at least. At first we'd fuck a little, but not anymore. I'd jerk him off, that's all. He wasrt really in the mood lately. You didn't jerk him off, did you? If I find out you took work from me I'll kill you. I could never. You could never what? Be with men for money. But you can keep them dead under a sheet. - It's not the same. - Of course it isn't. What you did is worse. What I did was out of necessity. And what I do isn't? Listen to her! When is his daughter coming back? In two weeks. She had him rotting in there. Look at this place, they haven't changed the curtains in 20 years. They're real bastards. Take it from me. What am I supposed to do now? Hold the fort, sweetie. That's all you can do. What hurts me the most is it's my fault nobody's praying for him. So he goes to heaven. Not even his family. It's not like he'll mind staying here a bit longer. Do you think he'll mind? I don't think so. He was a very patient man. Will you help me? Me? Help you pray for him? I don't think me praying will do him much good. But you knew him well. Who better to pray for his soul? Anyone else, sweetie. I'm a hooker. But you had a relationship. A hooker-client relationship. Exactly. Your prayers are won'th more. My prayers are won'th more? You haven't read the Bible? Books aren't really my thing. I'm more into movies. Think that nobody's praying for him. That makes two of us. Would I have to go to confession to be able to pray? There aren't enough priests in all of Spain... Your sins would be forgiven. Besides, I don't know how to pray. Just remember him, the time you spent together. Or just remember him, period. Arert you going to kneel? I'm fine right here, thank you. I've spent enough time on my knees. It's better to pray on your knees. Why is that? If you're on your knees, God listens to you first. I don't think that's how it works. If you kneel it means you're more in need and He knows that. URGEN "Amador. Are you all right? You haven't answered my letters. I'm afraid... I'm afraid something might have happened to you. I'm thinking of calling your daughter. I know you wouldn't want me to. Please write me back upon receiving this letter. If I don't receive news from you I'll telephone your daughter. Adela." "Dearest Adela. I have news here. There's a new girl coming every day. I think they're paying her to argue with me because that's all she does. She's like you in that respect. I can feel my time here running out. Do you ever hear the mermaids behind the wall at night? I'm not sad. It'll only be a little while in the dark and soon another woman shall bear me. But I don't want to leave without telling you something I never told you because I was too ashamed, even though you might not expect to hear it anymore or even need to. It's important to me. I wouldn't want to keep these words inside or take them along with me because inside me... Inside me they have no value but in you they may blossom. I love you with all my heart. URGEN I'm sorry. It's very urgent. Nelson. If something ever happened to you, anything at all, and we were never going to see each other again... is there anything important you would want me to know? What's going to happen to me? If you died, for example. Why am I going to die? What's the matter? Are you okay? Is there anything? No. You already know everything. Have you run out? Of both. Did you tell Amador about his scale? What did he say? He laughed. Amador? He's asleep. I haven't seen him lately. Is he okay? He's fine, he's asleep. He can't see you right now. I'd like to speak to him. Like I said, he can't right now. Something stinks in the courtyard. I think it's coming from downstairs. Have you checked? No, it can't be. Nobody lives down there. It's not here, ask next door. I have to go. - Tell Amador I need to speak to him. - I will. Please, God... I'm begging you. Who are we praying for, my child? For someone who has left us? He's gone but... it's like he's still here. Yes, Father. Is that why you're so in pain? That's not a bad thing. It isn't? Of course not. They're never completely gone, you know. They remain among us. Their presence makes us feel better. It helps us live, to a large extent. Even though they're dead. Like flowers. They keep giving us their aroma after they've died. But I'm to blame, Father. Why, my child? For not letting him go. For keeping him here with me. That's love. You need him so much you don't want to accept his death. I really, really need him, Father. - That's why you won't let him go. - That's why. And his presence is so important to you, so necessary, it's like you see him every day. I do see him every day. Every day, Father. You know what? In doing so you're helping him. Do you think so? I know so, my child. You're helping him and you're helping yourself. And my husband. And your husband, of course. And everyone close to you. - Yes, Father. - But listen to me. He's helping you as well. He's helping me a lot. A whole lot, Father. Of course he is. It hurts you not to let him go, but it's also a huge benefit. Then... do you think I shouldn't let him go, Father? Of course not. Who would he be better off with than you? Talk to him. Thank him for his generosity, what he's doing for you. He's taking care of you. He's your guardian. Thank you. It's almost over. Soon, okay? Maybe they're spirits. Or Amador. His soul is in pain because we won't let him leave in peace. I'd be in pain too, living in such a dump. They say if you don't bury the dead right they end up in limbo. I had a customer once who was a podium. Podium? He could see ghosts. Medium. Medium, whatever. He could see ghosts. And he talked to them while fucking and right when he'd come his eyes would turn white and he'd go into a trance. It was really scary. - He'd talk to his dead mother too. - What about? They'd bicker, normal mother stuff. But I felt really awkward. I would look the other way. He'd talk to his ancestors too, to his grandparents and to an ex-girlfriend who died of an overdose. It was hard for me to concentrate - with so many people talking. - No wonder. He was a good son. And a good customer, too. Did he ever talk to you about the clouds? Amador. He said something once. That God hides behind them when He's ashamed. But I didn't get if it's because He's ashamed of what we do or of what He does. Did he ever tell you that? I'd remember. What will you say? When his daughter comes. I don't know. Does he look really bad? I haven't seen him since. Maybe they won't notice. They put make-up on them, right? On dead people. They put blush on them. Wax and stuff. I know because I have a customer who works at a funeral parlor. Samuel. He's a very good customer too. Hey there. What was so urgent? You never come to see me. Here I am. This is the friend I told you about. Marcela. - Hello. How are you? - Samuel. Hi. Come and I'll show you. Did you bring your powders and stuff? It's all in here. He'll look great, you'll see. Samuel is an artist. He started working in movies, but that didn't work out and he switched to this. It's not as flashy but he'll never be out of work. I'm pregnant. Nobody knows. Just Amador. And the father? The father doesn't know either. I've never been able to imagine myself with him, the two of us growing old together. My life with him, the things that will happen to us. It's weird. You think you want to be with someone but what you actually want is not to be alone. So you find someone and it's the same thing, you're still alone. Like Amador. Can I touch it? He left it his spot here. What a bargain! Have you picked out a name yet? Amador? He's asleep. I want to talk to him. The courtyard stinks. I'm sorry... How silly of me! I forgot to take them out. It's my fault. Excuse me, please. RETURNED TO SENDER REASON: RECIPIENT DECEASED Hello, everyone. Welcome to the program. It's Thursday, and as you know, Thursday's a lucky day here on our game show. So we hope our contestants win a lot of money today... You lost some blood, Marcela. But the baby is okay, all right? Don't worry. I knew it. Did you? We saved it a spot. I'm taking care of it. Does it look like me? It looks just like you. What happened today? You left the old man alone? He's doing fine. He doesn't need me anymore. Have they paid you yet? It isn't for you, Nelson. Hello? Who is this, Fany? No, tell me what's wrong. What do you mean? What do you mean, Fany? Put your sister on. What happened, Fany? Tell me. Please, calm down. We were preparing a room for him at the new house. With a view of the sea. He'd have loved it. My father loved the sea. Did he ever tell you that? It's too bad he won't be able to enjoy it. It's almost finished. He would have really liked it. It's not finished yet. You know what building is like. We're behind schedule and over-budget. I don't know how we'll manage. My husband is a salesman, he works for himself and things are tight. We've put all our money into it and my in-laws pitched in as well. And we're still short. My father was helping us too, with his pension. It isn't much, but every little bit helps. That's why we need a little more time. Just a little, not much. We're very happy with you. You've done a great job. That's why we'd like you to keep coming. And keep doing what you've been doing until now. Air out the place, pick up the mail. Keep him company, so he won't be alone. Just a month or two. Otherwise places deteriorate. This is the money you're owed and there's an advance for next month. The house will be finished soon. And that'll be it. I'll handle the neighbor. He's not a bad person, just a bit of a pain. He would have agreed to this. He didn't like leaving things unfinished. It's incredible, isn't it? When I saw him. How can something that isn't alive be so beautiful? And him still helping us... That's love, right? Like flowers. Like flowers, that's true. I don't know if your parents are still alive, Marcela. But now that he's gone... there's this huge hole. Huge. Don't worry. It will soon be filled. There's a saying in my land. You can only truly hear once everything is quiet. Right there. Let me see. Perfect. And only when your arms and legs are claimed by the land will the real dance begin. Marcela? FLOWERS "My dearest Nelson..." Have you picked a name yet?
