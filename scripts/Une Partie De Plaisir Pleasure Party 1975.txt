Take it off the hook! Scaredy-cat! Let's make love. Here? What of it? What if someone comes? He'll get an eyeful! Nobody will come. I really want you! Wonderful! We'll come back. Yes, we'll go there again. We'll come again. Where you going, Papa? For some logs. Can I go with you? Time for bed. It's 9. Just this once! Just once! I know that old song. She's 6 years old. Her playmates go to bed later now. It's not... Next thing, she'll spend her nights at Castel's club! Put your things away and go to bed. Sleep well, honey. Tell me a story. - Lights out! - Won't you go to sleep? A fairy tale! Nixon or Brezhnev? What, then? You know! You mean, the... You guessed! Riding... You guessed it! Riding hood? What color? Red! Bored? Not at all! Why? - It's improper to cut salad. - I don't care. Still love me? Yes. After 8 years? You're crazy! And you? You'd be hurt if I cheated on you? How should I know? You mean I should try? You already have? Yes. Often? It's unimportant. That's what you say! Everyone says so! Yes, all the men. Forgive the comparison but it's like... having a cigarette or a drink. - And you? - Have you? You know I haven't. How can you ask such a thing? Many strange things do exist. They'd bowl us over if we only knew. Look me in the eyes. I wouldn't mind. I wouldn't mention it again. You really haven't? Never. What's wrong with you? It merely crossed my mind. Tell me now. If I found out later... I'd wish you dead. Well? You should. What? Sleep with another guy. To some, sleeping around means cheating. Let's prove it's not. Who's coming? Katkof, Isabel, Michel, Fernand... Ow! A thorn! Who else? Annie, Francois and a pal. Who? I forget his name. The thin one, back from Tokyo. He gets on my nerves. He's always "with it". I don't like him. Neither do I. That kind of guy's always playing games... paranoiac... flipping out... What's for dinner? Veal Blanquette. I love it! With lemon! Yes, I know! Always. It's too juicy. Use a low flame or the meat will be tough. Before serving, warm the sauce. - Lf it sticks... - I know, I know! Don't chop it so fine! - I finish what I begin! - They're here. Keep your apron on. Don't be fancy! Tequila and triple sec. Lemons? I'll make some real Margaritas! How are you? Everyone's here? This is Habib. Just back from Tokyo? We've met before. Maybe at Castel's. Sure, I always forget who's there. He's got his guitar. Big deal! Where's the juicer? - Wait will you see this! - Margaritas! Salt? Under the sink. Annie, a plate, please! Can I help you? Wash that... clean! Can I go with you? Has she eaten? Hamburger and a yogurt and... she ate it all. Time for bed now! You'll come, too? I've got work to do. Say goodnight. To Papa, too. Come say goodnight. Tell me a story. I can't tell you stories all the time. Tomorrow, I promise. Lucky kid! Off to bed! This'll shake you up! Thou Shalt Not Be Naked... The Wrong Love Story... Wild Sex... How about that! Garbo... That's not bad. Plow girls... Summer Camps... A Lifetime... and The Longest Day. That remind you of anything? Hey, guys! Wait! A Modern Wife's Sex Life... Plow girls... The Broad Jumpers... and... Miss Innocence Among the Plow girls... I'd like that! The Irony of Chance... and 2 Girls In 1 Pair of Pajamas! My darling angel. Again! Again! Such soft skin! I'll open the drapes. Just halfway. That's nice. Close them a bit. My eyes hurt. I love croissants! They're fresh and hot. The others? Left an hour ago. Where you going? The man's coming about the sick trees. I got work to do. You're a llama. What? You got a llama's nose. We all look like an animal. You're a llama. Glad to be a llama? If it makes you glad. Love me? You're the little llama I love. I love you, too. That crap's in my way! I'm happy, even if it shocks you. How do you find Esther? Wonderful! I wonder why I love her, but I do. At times she annoys me but I don't care. Her weak points move me. She's beautiful and sensitive. Your melons are expensive! They're not! I'll have some peaches. Why laugh? I'm not! Liar! You are! You say "pitches". What? You shorten long vowels "Pitches". You say "shocolate". I don't! "Pitches", "shocolate". Next time, I'll shop alone! Go ahead! Buy some chocolate! - I'd like some... - What? "Shocolate". I like it here. I'll never forget it. I'm very happy. "Athenian slanderer"; 9 letters. "Sycophant" with a Y and PH. You know everything! Anyone knows that word. Not me. You're a ninny. Slept with Habib? Yes. I don't like him. Racist! He's very nice. Maybe, but... he's a ball-breaker. So... he's a good lay? Great. In love with him? You crazy? I like him, that's all. More than the others? Michel or Katkof? How should I know? It's funny that we... should come to this. Just live without questions. Women can. Men always ask questions. Anything wrong? Something's upset you? We promised to tell all. Sure... sure. Everything will be fine... if you always love me. I do! That had nothing to do with it. I hope not. Other guys and gals are preventive medicine. We must remember that. I had Isabel. Was it good? So-so. That's all? Jealous? Not even a little? I'm not wild with joy. I don't care. A year ago you'd have clawed my eyes out. We were silly! - 7 letters: 1-eyed glass. - "Monocle". Come look. What? What've you got? You know I hate that! Come see something. How horrible! That's life. June 27th. Mean anything? Not at all. You're becoming odd. You used to remember everything... dates, big events in life. I was wrong. The past is the past. We don't live for that. For what then? What else do we possess? I'm still young, I prefer the future. You think the future means youth? The future means death. June 27th I told you we were free. Here are some official science liabilities. Why hide the Easter Island hieroglyphics? Why hide 30, 000- y e a r - o I the secret city of Ptaah... capital of the MU empire? Why deny the exact precision of the... Earth's meridian as related... to the pyramidal cubit? Who stifled Abdul Kalifa... - Who's this guy? - Habib's friend. His name? - Rosco. First or last name? Last. He won't say his first name. His theory is that one's first name is magic... ...to throttle the imagination as if afraid of initiatory theses. A shot of red? - A genius, no? - Who? Rosco. The very word I was looking for! You're unfair. He could make an A-bomb all alone... without tools. Don't talk bullshit! But everyone says so! Says who? Habib? His ideas on Mozart are right... the same as yours! Any fool finally speaks the truth! Like a stopped clock! It's right twice a day! - Not bad! - Get us something to drink. Esther's doing the dishes? Don't bug Esther about Rosco. Sorry, but I overheard. How can she take that clown seriously! Shit! I taught her good taste... gave her a critical eye and... now she's in the pyramidal cubit! Zeus will be next! But women love that! So be careful! - Of what? - Just be careful, Philip! Don't be a schmuck! I refuse to shut up. What're you doing? Dishes! They're all plastered! Right! Me, too! That's true! Move over! Hands off! I'm working! - I'm hot. - That's enough! I know you! I love your ass. It's a real fistful! You're a real "sick" one! How's it stay so nice? You sure know how to talk to a lady! Stop! I said stop it! Don't wiggle so much! That's the last straw! And you break my dishes! The primary freedom is the absence of desire. This ritual hand gesture is found... on statues of the gods. I untie the bonds of Will. Bullshit! Why bullshit? I say so and I'm always right. Perhaps not. - Everyday talk about... - liberty makes me shit... exactly like pollution... acupuncture or sociology. Wanting a thing always leads to its opposite. The French freedom revolution led to passports! Pour me another! Listen, my dear friend... the poor guy who talks of liberty is scared of his... mother-in-law... or tied up in knots! He wants to change things! Not really. Few people really want... to be free. When they are... it's not always fun. Freedom is the anxiety of emptiness... the responsibility of solitude. They won't say so but they prefer slavery. It means security... with a salary and insurance. A slave's treated better than a free man. He's cared for. He's valuable merchandise. To live happily, live like lunatics! Freedom's a pain! - I think... - You mustn't! Even so I think... Gandhi freed his people. Come on! Ever climbed over the corpses in Calcutta? Famine, revolt, millions of dead! Non-violence is lovely! Gandhi killed more people than Hitler and Stalin. A drink? I will. You upset him. Rosco. I'm delighted. It wasn't polite. You claim to be a perfect host. To hell with that! Do you mind? Since when did you care what I think! There's only you, you, you! Don't look that way! It's for your own good! Still my llama? I'm going up. Sleeping with Annie? Why? If you are, I'll sleep with Habib. Do as you wish. Well! What's wrong? Time to get cracking! It's always that way. You're a bit of a flop, huh? I don't know what's wrong. In the kitchen, you were rearing' to go! - We drank too much. - Speak for yourself! Shit! I'm really ashamed. It's not important. But I want to! I don't understand. Stop playing with yourself! These things happen! Forget it! Anyway, I'm not touchy! Your heart's beating. Lucky me! Quiet! Let me listen! Funny! It sounds like soldiers marching. You scare me. You're sweet. I love you. Liar. Liar. I want to love you. That's not the same! I wonder... A body's strange. How's that? - Always the same. - Breasts, a stomach... thighs... It's confusing. And yet... Sleep well? Jam from the garden? Lots of fruit there... this year except for the prune trees. - Why? - They're getting old. Times are getting tough. Well, I need bread to go shopping. The "bread" is in my hip pocket. Take what you need. What's that? A guitar. Francois got it half-price. Going to learn? You say playing an instrument... helps one think. About what? Everything. Why a guitar? It's the easiest. The least effort for the most understanding. Come see my trees. What's wrong? - Why such a face? - What face! You don't like it here? Itd be a pity. Look, in life everything goes! Share the females, wear an omelet as a hat or... play a guitar but don't make it a philosophy! Itd be too stupid to spoil the essential. What's the essential? If you don't know, I wonder why we met. Everything always leads to you. You make the decisions I only say "amen"! Someone had to teach me how to live, too! Let's not be silly! This one's dead! Itll cost more than I feared. Why invest in a thing that barely pays off? It hardly pays the house! That's not bad. We could do better. You really want to stay here? But it's our house! We rent it! And the rent's high! There are others nearer Paris... or in Paris. I feel as if I was born here. Elise was 6 months when we moved in! My memories begin here... as if my grandma built the house. You think so? Itd be better for us both. We need something else. We need a change. Alright? - It'll be better tomorrow. - I hope so. Glad to be moving? Yes. I can go to school in Paris. You want to? I wouldn't! Let's go see Mama. It's fun to make a change. We'll act crazy. You want to? I'm almost done. Ready? It's a mess downstairs! We're going to Paris? You'll have a new room... freshly painted, with all your toys. Brand new? I forgot my horse! Your oldest toy! We'll take it with us and keep it. I'm selling the orchards. I'll make you an offer. I'll give you the dough and be your partner. A serious job's not your style! Everything interests me! After all... why not? I can always use new money. Esther wasn't too wrong. It was nice there but we were in a rut. There's so much to do in life. Let's see... Wonderful! It's fine like that! Pass me the hammer. Let me do it! It's pretty nice here, huh? Yes. Big houses are a responsibility. I was fed up with having the gang all the time. Me, too! And the dishes! Now we can travel a little... go to Brittany. Why not spend Christmas in... Ceylon or Burma? Want to? Philip, you won't like this. I want to work. Great! What do you want to do? Habib has a job for me. In his music publishing house. I know lots of people, so I could do public relations. See the press, the singers... It should be fun! When do you start? As soon as possible. We spoke of Brittany. I start work soon, too. Why not a trip to get us in shape? Oh, yes, Mama! Let's lose no time! We'll go now! I can't. I've an appointment... with the upholsterer. Tonight then! We'll leave at 7, dinner at Lou... prawns and Jasnires wine. Then, St Malo! Alright. What time is it? Is that a lot? A bit too much. Will you teach me to play cards? Go wash up! Mama will be here soon. I'll put my hat on. Who is it? Quiet! Hello? Alright... Too bad. Call me later? Who was it? Mama. She's coming? She's not? We're not going? We'll have fun anyway. You can watch TV till 10:00! We'll have a party. You made it after all! At least say hello! Still dreamy? A light! Where were you? A business date? I was with Francois, Michel and... some friends at the movies. You couldn't phone? You know how it is... having to wait for a phone booth. Look at yourself in the mirror! She's here? I hate to sleep alone. I'll put her to bed. Let's go beddy-bye. - I want to talk! - Tomorrow. I'm sleepy. Tomorrow it'll be something else... errands, friends, Lord knows! We'll talk now! I'm already asleep. You should've come home earlier! Listen, we made an agreement but... you're ignoring it. It wasn't... a question of parallel lives. It was to bring us closer together. But it's to fight me that you got a job... see your pals... and go into idiotic philosophies! Listen to me! Or I'll throw water on you! The alarm's set for 7. Elise is due at the... dentist's and I'm no nanny! What bugs me... isn't your little friends but that... you swallow their crap! Hear me? You must be a real fool. It's upsetting... to realize I wasn't smart enough to educate you. That's it! You, you, always you! You come home at dawn! You ignore your child! All you care about is yourself and... your lousy friends... because they flatter you and yet... I'm the egoist! People do change. I've changed. How about that! Either you're a hopeless schmuck or else... you're not and don't need to change! I warn you. If we part... it's for good. We'll never meet again. Understand? Get up! It's time! Make the coffee! Madam's begun to think... all by herself! "I'm a free woman!" "I've untied the umbilical cord of Wisdom. " - Come dance! - Shut up! "I'm Bergier... Pauwels, Bouvard and Pecuchet. " "My new job is... high priestess in Egypt or Tibet... depending on the day. " "I predict the future as Bovary the Hick!" Have a drink, Hick! Poor schmuck! You're going a bit too far! I'm fed up with her crises! She's not 18 anymore! You won't help her this way. Fuck off! What a pile of bullshit! I'm fed up! So sorry to wake you, dear! Come get washed. Sorry for yesterday but... you were a bit much. Have fun, but keep it under control! How can we always "keep it under control"? That's what we want to prove! It's not an order but you shouldn't see... Zoroaster, Habib and Co. So often. That'd help a lot. You've stopped being you. It's like a madness! Who's he? Aristide Bruant. Who was he? A singer. And him? Landru, a murderer. He killed people. Is that nasty? Usually. However, at times... Mama's nice to you? You're sad she has a job? She takes you out? You meet her friends? Who does she see most? All of them! Michel? Katkof? Habib? Rosco? Who's Rosco? A small guy... dark, serious, with big calf eyes. A magus. What's a magus? A man who tells you everything, what to do and... not do, how to eat your soup, everything! - We've met? - A man who knows everything? Absolutely. Once at your house in the country... and again a week ago with... Annie, Katkof and some others. Of course! Sit down! You're Sylvia. Yes, Sylvia Murdock. Your daughter? You're lucky. Sorry to be so familiar. You're the same way with old ladies? It has caused problems. Sorry for the other night. I yelled at Esther. I was a bit drunk. So was I. The result wasn't the same. I'm ashamed. No... it's normal. I was married 3 times. We argued day and night. One explains the other. Want a drink? A Pastis. Could I have your phone number? Give me yours. American? No, I'm English. I've had 2 French husbands. I've been here a long time. Why're you staring at me? You look so serious. Me? I'm always screwing things up. That happens to me as I get older. When I scrutinize a face, it makes me laugh. Why'd you yell at her? Esther? For lots of things. Always talking of freedom. It goes with guitar playing. Thanks, darling. Afraid of crabs? Still afraid of crabs? I'm not fond of them. And spiders? The same. At least you haven't changed there! Mama, I can't do it. I'll help you. These females who talk... of freedom and dignity, yet are afraid... of a lizard or a butterfly! You think that's adult! Don't blubber when I talk to you! We were raised differently! When you finish, maybe I can piss in peace! Can I sleep with the cards? If you want, sweetie. Give me a kiss. In 2 minutes. You cheated. A minute is 60 seconds. You must count to 120. Stop! You make me nervous. Tell me a story? Tomorrow. I'm very tired tonight. I know you're in there! Open up or I'll smash the door! Alright! Esther, get up! Or shall I help you? Esther, there's no sense in hiding. Get dressed! OK, but go outside. Scared we'll see you naked? He and I know you by heart! Don't humiliate her. It's not the best way to win her back. That's unimportant. I want to save her soul. I don't care if she fucks but... I don't want her destroyed. I destroy nothing. I don't mean only you. Weak minds aren't allowed to make errors. She sides with Korzybski who claims... to refute Aristotle but... she hasn't read either one! She runs down Descartes because you all do. It's in and you're all conformists who don't even... know what he meant! That's dangerous! The world's changed. How? We don't really need to "know". We live. OK, but in that case, you shut up! What's she up to? - Sorry for the door. - Me, too! I want to sleep. Nobody wins in this mess. Nobody wants to, I hope. I've got to talk to you. I know. But make it the last time. Mind my smoking? Yes, but if that helps you... Don't talk to me that way. I'll do as I please. I'll make my own terms! I'm listening. We'll begin again. OK. No more wise men, thinkers... and no more Habib. Yes or no? Yes. You work, sleep around as you wish... but at 7:00, you're here! OK. And look after Elise whom you now neglect. That's a lie, but I accept. And you'll look after me, too. OK. Is that all? That's it. Then go to sleep. Not so fast. Shit, have we made up or not? We've made up. Then kiss me. That's nice. You love me, I love you. That'll show the gossips! Good. Let's sleep now. Let's make love. Let's make love! OK, let's make love. Stop! Lousy whore! Slut! Shitty peasant cunt! Say you're sorry or I'll kill you! I'm sorry. You want your kicks! Fine! Lick it for me! Lick it or I'll kill you! May I come in? You have a nice place! How'd you find me? I phoned and asked the maid. Sit down. Want a drink? Good idea. Sorry, the fridge is on the blink. I don't mind. Would you... like to marry me? Yes. Me, too. It is a bit warm. Sorry. You and Esther aren't together? She's left. It was becoming a nightmare. Are you sad? No, I can breathe now! Where is she? I don't know. Disappeared! And your child? I put her in a home for now. Old Louise went back to her village. All I got is my shirt and a toothbrush. Free at last! What does Esther say about it? How's she managing? I don't know. I haven't seen her. Straight! It's a terrible thing to say but... we weren't from the same social class. That's bad? Not at first, but later we didn't... speak the same language. A leopard can't change its spots. That means what it says. I got married, like an idiot. I didn't give a damn. Then I stopped not giving a damn. Know who my second husband was? Habib! What? That's crazy! I had 2 kids with him. With my family in Scotland. What a mess! My God! What's Habib really like? Underneath? Underneath, nobody's nobody. When I met him, he didn't do a thing. He played cards, wandered around. My family was furious but I loved him. He's very nice. And bright, no matter what you think. I don't think a thing. I don't care! Divorce? We weren't married. We were all right as we were. I'm a stranger to you. Not at all! We only met twice... both times, a bit drunk. I ought to laugh! No one's stopping you. You're no longer sad? No! Freed, relaxed! No regrets? No, it's over, dead and buried. I declare you man and wife. You're a devil but I love you. Is that the car? Sure you can drive? I'll prove it! What if cops stop you? I'll be polite to 'em! And the alcohol test? Fuck it! You're my good old pals. I love you both. You been real nice. I've got one! Your line's caught! Pull! He's wiggling! What a fantastic girl! Can you take it off? I think so. Want me to put a crab on for you? I'll try to do it. Not afraid of crabs? Don't be silly! What's wrong, darling? Feel all right? Yes. What is it? Nothing. You look odd. Really? Are you crying? You're crazy! No, it's the wind... the salt air... this damn sea spray. I'm better now. It's so beautiful here! Maybe it was wrong to come. Like boarding school? Yes, we eat real good! What'd you eat for lunch? Mashed potatoes, meat and string beans. And "shocolate" mousse. You say "shocolate" like Mama. "Shocolate". "Pitches" and "shocolate". You'd like us all to live together again? Mama, you and me. With Louise? With Louise, a cat and some birds. And some birds. We'd go out. Look straight ahead! Look happy! At the gate! With Louise and kittens... I'd build you a swing. We'd go to the woods and pick flowers. Like to? Yes, Papa. Seen Mama? Last Sunday. Oh, she said she'd buy me a coat. Nothing about me? Sure? I'm sure. Look how nice... the trees, the light... Is Mama sad? You should love her a lot. I love Mama and you. What do you learn at school? To read... and we learn... - to draw. I drew a big house for Mama. She liked it? We're almost there! I want to go there. Let's see. Want to help me? And tell Mama to come back to me? We'd be 3 again! Forever! Wouldn't it be great? I'm sad without Mama and you. It's sad when things break up. Buy me a kite? Sure, honey. You'll remember to tell Mama? She doesn't want to come back to you. She said so? Last Sunday. Bears are mean. No one's really mean. Throw that away. Toss him some peanuts. Throw it. You'll tell Mama? Tell her what? You don't remember? Think a little about... what I said in the boat? On the "Magic River"? Think hard. About telling Mama Yes! Don't forget! You'll do it? Buy me a kite? I'm going out. We're short on money. I'll have some next week. A lot? Not much. I'm in a bind. We must pay the school, the dentist, Katkof... and buy me a couple of dresses. That's cheery! I guess I'll go to London. Why? To sell some stocks. Got some? How do you think I managed? You have a lot? No kidding! It's incredible! Where's it from? My parents are stinking rich. What kind? Copper or aluminum... I don't know. But my two brothers are schmucks! They know we've wed? No. That reminds me, I must write them. I'm going out. I don't feel very good. It's almost 11. Why not go to bed? Angry? Not at all. I got to think-that're schmucked up. Go ahead. Excuse me. Where were you? I'll tell you later. I'm a bit drunk. Quite drunk. Let's make love. Know who I met this morning? Esther. She seems fine. She's working on Lena Ave. Of all things! Don't be afraid! You OK? Fine. How come you're here? I work nearby. What kind of job? As a secretary. Making any dough? Want to lunch with me? Don't be silly. I won't eat you. We must discuss Elise. A nice Morgon! A '61? I'm proud of you. You taught me well. This year's wine will be great! I want you to come back to me. Just like that? I need you. It's like I'd had an organ removed. I talk to you all day. I go on endlessly. I try to make you love music... the sea, the forest... and me and Elise. It's terrible. I get no rest when I sleep. I never dream about my problems. Yes... you are there. We argue... we go to Brittany... and make love at times. It's odd what I feel. There's no other word... odd! I relive... - what we lived. I sniff your old perfume bottles. I touch what you touched. I walk along your streets. I pretend I'm you. But what helps me live... also helps me die. I'll never go back to Tahiti... Honfleur, Brittany or Kashmir. "Never". Know what that means? I was born to be joyful! Sometimes, but not often... I forget. Early in the morning I go out... and look at the flower vendor. The air's fresh. I feel... like leaping in the air. Then it all falls apart. I tell myself I haven't the right. Not to the flowers nor the sunshine. Cigarette? No thanks. In my head I look at our life... as if it was someone else's. Terrifying! The poor bastard. I wouldn't want to be in his shoes. Then, I realize! The one who lost everything... who's hopeless... who'll never laugh again... it's me. But you have Elise. You were a whole. She's a half without you. Seeing her makes me sad. Oh, did she tell you? What? She said nothing? Will you come back to me? You've got to help me. How? Talk to Esther. And tell her what? To come back to me. It's a real mix-up. I wed your ex-wife. You stole mine. Small world! I didn't steal her. She left... to look for something else. That's what I blame her for! She loved the good things, but now... But I'm fed up with this half-assed palaver. Tell her to come back. You can influence her. It'd be better for her, for Elise and me. I'll try. You can give her some good reasons. Tell her I've changed... that I'll be kind. Let's hope it works. It has to. You're my last chance. Habib called me. You really want Esther back? Never mind. Yes or no? Yes and no. Look what I found. Mama, Papa wants you back. Where'd you find it? In Elise's homework. Strictly by accident. I told you I've never met a girl... as wonderful as you. I thought you knew. Knew what? All of that. Esther's not as good as you. You have more generosity, more heart. And yet... I know her too well. One day she may become something wonderful. A treasure! You love her? Everyone's laughing at you! Katkof and Michel have talked to me. They know! They're laughing! I don't give a damn. Look. We're married. I'm your wife. I want to hang on to you. I do hope you succeed. It's you... Hold on! Love you... Esther! Right away. She needs me. Her aunt's dead. She raised Esther... a nice woman. When'd it happen? A few days ago. She's already buried. I didn't even know! It's nice you thought of me. Nobody else knew her. Besides... I'm scared to go alone. Not a very happy cemetery. Know where she is? It's written down. It's quite far. What was it? Cancer. - She'd never said a word. I love you more and more. Not now! When? We never meet! You handled me wrong. How's that? I was fine as your reflection. Now I exist and you don't know me. You only knew me through you. You didn't help me, you judged me. You should've let me leave. I'd have come back. I'm not very clever. I couldn't foresee things. If I leave you alone? If I play dead? You'll come back? I don't know. I'll have to wait long? It's dumb to be in love after ten years. Your pals must be laughing! No, but it's a bit dumb. Know how our life would be if you come back? Hell. You'd rediscuss everything! You've got me wrong! Be nice and I'll forget everything. It's easy to accuse me... of what you made me do. I believe in transcendence... things beyond our reach... beyond our merit. If we do reach them... everything is transformed. The weakest man becomes a god. After all the suffering... and this hate that's like... depraved love, our life will... be marvelous! We'll turn... our feelings inside out like a glove. After surpassing all a couple's horrors... and miseries, everything is beautiful. What you say is impossible. Why? I've never... - believed in common sense. We must, Esther! This must be it. Yes, it is. Did she suffer? I don't know. Please come back to me. I can't. Why? You love another guy? No... I can't. I've been too unhappy... too lonely. There must be some compensation... to balance out what I've been through. I've been too unhappy. What do you want? - Come back. - I can't! No one will love you now! What's on the wall? Heads. Heads? All the spots resemble heads. Like seeing things in clouds... Father, mother... your wife... A visitor! Finally! How long you been here? I don't know. Got the world mad at you? I guess not! Hello, sweetie. You look like a llama. I brought a pineapple, figs... some "shocolate" and my drawings. Fine. Show them to me. Very pretty! You've improved. I have more at school. Give me the little horse. We can't. We'll leave it at the desk. You live here? All the time. Working hard at school? Not very. But later it's important to know... reading and figures. George always annoys me. Who's George? You don't know him? He's a little boy who annoys me. Who drove you here? Michel. Where is he? Downstairs. He wouldn't come up. What's this fence for? To keep me from kissing my Llama. I'm scratchy. Where's Mama? On a trip. She'll be gone long? No, you'll see her soon. Give her a great big kiss. Promise not to forget! I saw a gorilla. You always forget. And tell her... What? Nothing. Maybe one day we'll all three be together. It'd be so wonderful. Like to? Are you going to stay here? For now, yes. A long time? I don't know. Maybe 2 years. Maybe longer. Is that a lot? For you, it's very long. You'll have to count to... Stop. You'll be a big girl at the end. Let's go!
