There's a box riding on this visit. How are you feeling? Fine. Fine? I just want to get it over with; it's time. Let's smoke a joint. This is a psychological evaluation. I have to be straight. You're hardly straight on Lorazepam. Lorazepam's legal. Paint something. I'm trying; nothing comes. I hate to say it, but I think I'm blocked. Blocked blocked or blocked? Blocked blocked. Eew. Yep. Paint me. Nude? Dick and all? The dick's not mine. Hideous mistake. Absolutely. They cut it off, Shannon. They can't put it back. I don't have a problem with that. Most guys are attached to their willies. Do I look like most guys to you? Point taken. Love ya. Mean it. [Inhales and exhales deeply] Was the food okay? Oh, great. My therapist's father died. I'm sorry to hear that. You're sweet. Thanks. Were you close to him? Not particularly. Oh. Thanks for coming. Pleazh. (Matt) Night. Thanks again. Pretty hot, huh? Was she? Yeah. No, she's nothing compared to you. Matt, some of those dishes sat up for a while tonight. Dinner hour's pretty busy sometimes. Maybe we should think about another waiter. You wanna put an ad in the paper? Yeah. You wanna do the hiring, or should I? I'll leave it to you. All right. [Woman singing over radio] I did my best painting when I was a waiter. I did my best writing when I was a virgin. Life's a barter system. I need a job. As a what? A waiter. You hated being a waiter. You meet people, overhear things, see new faces. (Kryla) Shlep chow for dicks who don't tip. This painting is shit. What if someone recognizes you? I'll go to some dump where no one'll know me. Oan you believe my therapist? Having a family tragedy when I'm ready for gender reassignment. And she calls herself a professional. I'm going to get a job. A what? As a waiter. What brought this on? With the exception of you and Kryla, all my friends have died, gone crazy, or moved away. I never get out of the house anymore. I need... Stimulation? Inspiration. Mm-hmm. [Beeping] Indinavir? Will they make me giddy and excitable? No, but they will give you kidney stones. I'll take six. Thanks. We'll let you know. Yeah, right. Do I see you about the job? You're looking for a job? I have a resume. Do you ever. I'm not sure this is your kind of place. I can work any hours you offer, and I really don't care how much money I make. You're an angel from heaven, right? I've been told that. It's only a couple hours a night. That's not a problem. - You sure? - I'm sure. I'm David. Matt. (David) Interesting decorating choice. My wife collects them. Dave, this is Violet, my wife. Co-owner, chef, boss. Dave's the new waiter. I'd shake your hand, Dave, but I'm all wet. It's David, actually. (Matt) Sorry. Short hours okay with you? Just fine. Great. Welcome. 4:00 tomorrow. Sure. How old do you think he is? Hard to say. [Background piano music] Another bottle of anti-freeze? - No. - No? Work tomorrow. Evening. Think I'll go home, blow a sploof, and crash. Guess it's off at the Press Olub. Mm, catch my column tomorrow. - What's it about? - Lois Lane. Oh, I loved Lois Lane. She always wore the best hats and knew karate. Jimmy Olson was a fag. You moes think everyone's gay. He wore a green bow tie. Superman and Lois Lane are getting married. What? She's marrying him as Clark Kent. Doesn't even know he's Superman. Now, if that isn't the perfect metaphor for the modern relationship, I don't know what is. Jesus. (Shannon) Don't worry. I'm here for you Where exactly is this restaurant of yours? I'd like to drop by. I don't want anyone who knows me to know where it is. Really? (David) Really. Thanks for understanding. (Kryla) Oh, whatever. Love ya. Mean it. Young love is so... Young. Exactly. He's not from Earth. He's an alien. Krypton? Spider-man got married a couple of years ago. - Spider-man's from Earth. - So what? People from Earth can only marry other people from Earth? Maybe his cum's poison to humans. Superman's cum is not poison. They might have monster kids or something. (David) Hi. Superman's getting married. (David) I heard. Doesn't seem right after holding out for so long. (Violet) The restaurant's split half-and-half. You place the cutlery... I thought you checked the silver. I did. The place is casual. Make sure you get the food out while it's hot. Flip the tables as fast as you can. (David) Yes ma'am. Matt'll show you where everything is. And don't fuck with my kitchen. A waiter's place is not in the kitchen. You've got potential. You have no idea. [Chuckles] Don't let Violet intimidate you. Please. Slight complaint. What? The guy says the sauce is too salty. Tastes fine to me. It's quite common for cooks to lose their sensitivity to salt. It's fine. Do you want this customer to leave here and tell people he didn't enjoy his meal, or do you want him to leave here and talk about how accommodating the kitchen was in fixing his problem? Give me two minutes. You're the boss. [Country music over radio] Good night. Good night. Thanks. Great waiter. Thanks. Well, hotshot, any other suggestions? Well, since you asked. - What? - Your garnishes. What about them? Radishes carved into roses are very... '70s. So what kinda garnishes would you use instead? Kale. You can get it in mauve now. It's very eye-catching. Mauve kale? Jesus. What's kale? (Violet) It says in here most men fantasize about other people to keep their sex lives interesting. Yeah. You ever fantasize about other people? No. What is it? Nothing. Let me see. It's nothing. You ever fantasize about other people? No. Use a coaster, Matt. [Country music over radio] Well, I guess that's it for tonight. I'll take anything else that comes in. You need publicity. Do you know what it costs for an ad in the Tribune or The Sun? What are you doing? Moving this. Why? Well, no one's seeing it in here. Good point. Let the folks know what you're offering. You're not just a waiter, right? What? (Matt) What do you really do? L... paint. Oh, yeah? Like houses and shit? No, like pictures and shit. I've sold a few. Really? Wow. Good for you. It's not such a big deal. Having people pay for what you draw? Sounds like a big deal to me. I bet you're really good. I'm not bad. I used to want to draw comic books. I was really into it. Even drew a few full stories when I was in high school. I was pretty good. Why didn't you go after it? Do you know how many guys want to draw comics? Some of them actually do it. I'm realistic. Maybe you sell yourself short. I'd like to see your art sometime. What are you doing? Nothing. David put the special board in the window. That's a good idea. You want a beer, buddy? Buddy? What? Your husband just called me buddy. So? You guys know I'm gay, right? I didn't mean for it to be a big thing. I assumed you knew. I mean, I'm a waiter. You saying all waiters are fags? No. Just lots of them. Lots of fags are hairdressers too. And guys who arrange flowers. And guys who design dresses and people who make furniture and painters and writers and composers and... well, anything in the world that's pretty, we made it. Like mauve kale. We didn't make mauve kale. We just accessorized it. This is a problem. No! Really! (David) Are you sure? - Yeah. - Oh, yeah, yeah. See you tomorrow, then. Night. Tomorrow. [Door closes] Pretty nice for a fag. Yeah. Say you knew someone quite well, only say you'd never seen this person. You got to know each other with letters, the telephone, whatever, and now this person wanted to meet you, and you really wanted to meet them, but, say you'd told maybe one or two tiny untruths, and now you're afraid to meet this person that you know but have never seen because you're not everything you said you were. What would you do? Is this one of those Internet things? Well, yes. You meet guys on the Net? Oh, yeah. The computer's replaced my vibrator. I don't know what came over me. He gave me his number, and as soon as I heard his voice, I lied my fool head off. He sounded just like my favorite uncle Phil. Uncle Phil damage. What did you tell him? That I was 30. No. Good luck. In the right light. If I've had lots of sleep. And they've had lots of heroin. Shannon, please! What are you going to do? Stun him, stick him in the freezer until I've had cosmetic surgery. (David) Tell him the truth. Oh, I hate my mother. Why weren't we warned? Too busy ironing. So how's the tip money? Fine. Just let me come and check it out. I'll pretend not to know you. I'll write something nice about it in the column. No. (Kryla) Why not?! Because it's my secret. But you and I have never had secrets. We do now. (man) # Don't jump flat. # # Don't jump flat. # # (Matt) My father left when I was 11 years old. I was the youngest, so I don't remember him very well. (David) My old man made Fred Flintstone look like Oscar Wilde. (Matt) Vi's gonna be at her mom's late. I thought we could get a case of beer and go over to your place after we close up. (David) You aren't going? Vi's mom and I don't get along so well. So if you're free. I'm kind of tired. I want to see your artwork. Some other night. Sure. I do have time for a joint. Excellent. Merci. Wanna go to my place instead? I have video games. Some other night. You don't like straight people, do you? Some of my best friends are straight. No. Sorry. Yes, I'm aware they're installing the paintings this month. Sorry. No, not for an installation when I have another showing. I don't know when that will be. No. Soon. Yes. Bye. You didn't tell me you're sketching again. I'm sketching again. So the waiter thing was exactly what you needed. I guess. Why are you all dolled up? It's psychological evaluation time. The good doctor ran out of bereavement leave. Good luck. We could celebrate, if you're not working tonight. I should be off early. It's been dead. (Kryla) I'm meeting him again, tomorrow. (Shannon) Mr. Internet? Yes. He's so charming. (Shannon) Fuck him? Not on the first date, darling. Fabulous. - Good luck. - Gotta run. Vaginal appointment. Oh, see if you can get me a new one. The old one's drying out. - Mean ya. - Love it. Misuse does that to vaginas. (David) You're certain this guy's not a sex killer? Relatively certain. Incidentally, Paula at the O.B.O. Called me about the Legislature installation. I've got nothing to talk to Paula about. Talk about being a waiter. (David) Yeah, right. Working tonight? Yes. Really? [Hammer pounding meat] We can't afford a second waiter. I can't handle the place by myself at dinner. Honey, we don't have the money. But he's so damn good. And I like him. So do you. I know. But, Matt, we don't have the business. You'll have to handle the rush on your own. You want me to do it? No. I'll take care of it. I see you've got shepherd's pie on the menu tonight. You bet. Hi, Matt. We've got to talk. Sure. What's this? I thought they might brighten the tables up. That's great. Thanks. Oan I get coffee and dessert? Sure. (Kryla) Thank you... so much. (Matt) I'll take it. Right. [Background radio music] Have you got a match? No. Oh, silly me. I do have matches. (Matt) If it's stale, I'll make fresh. What do you have for dessert? Oarrot cake, cherry cheesecake, vanilla ice cream. I'll try the carrot cake. Dessert. You want me to wait? No. Good night, David. Good night, Vi. You look familiar. Oh, I have a newspaper column. (Matt) The Sun, right? The Trib, wrong. (Matt) Right. (Kryla) This cake is very good. The wife bakes it herself. How rural. I'm so glad I dropped by. (Matt) How'd you hear about us? Actually, an artist friend recommended you. More coffee. It's very hot. I really should be going. You hardly touched your cake. It was wonderful, really. I have a slight eating disorder. Lovely restaurant. What is your name? I'd like to mention you in the column. Matt Elmworth. And it's the Main Street Diner, right? (Matt) Yes. Here we are on Main Street. Ounning. Thank you so much. Good night. I have to lay you off until things pick up, David. What? Business isn't so good. I'll work for tips. Maybe later on. Business is gonna pick up. That woman who just came in. She's gonna write about you. One blurb. It won't be one blurb. She'll mention you a lot over the next few weeks. I know she will. (Matt) How? I have a feeling for these things. Don't fire me. You didn't fire him? (Matt) He brought us napkins. Cloth ones. How do you fire a guy that brings you napkins? Matt. That woman that was there when you left writes for The Sun. She's gonna mention us in her column. Get out. Don't want to turn around and have to hire another waiter. Guess we might as well see if the write-ups make any difference. Right. Something wrong? No. We spend an awful lot of time together. We're married. That's how it works. [Weatherman speaking softly over TV] [Techno music playing] (David) I want you to rave about it. I want you to drop the name in your column at least twice this week. Why would I possibly do that? Because they're going to go under if they don't get some asses in those chairs. This is unethical. Please. [Panting] You told him you'd write something. [Panting continues] Okay. Bastard. Shall I mention the scintillating wall of dolls? I thought we'd save it for a later feature. I will give them a mention. Only because I have a date with Mr. Internet tonight, and I'm in a good mood. Don't push it. Let's go out tonight. Where? I don't know. Honey, I'm dead at the end of the day. Just hang out. Hear some music, have some beers. No, really. Oome on. We'll dance. Dance? I can barely walk. I need to do something besides work here and hang out at the apartment all the time. See the paper today? No. What? (Matt) "An all round homey and excellent establishment that recalls the comfort meals prepared by a favorite aunt." You'll notice she included the address. Matt had us watching The Sun. You really think this'll help business? (David) I think so. Welcome to the Main Street Diner. Are you ever wrong? Only with sports questions. He knows everything. He know how to keep you out of trouble? What? Well, the husband needs a night out, and I'm too damn tired. You wanna keep an eye on him for me? I charge extra for baby-sitting. I'm good for it. Okay. Great. Right this way. Hey. DO's the best. Marvel sucks. Batman, Wonder Woman. Get real. There's no one better than Superman. True, Superman's the best of them all. Superman transcends the medium. Whatever that means. Superman's an icon. (waiter) Here you go. Thank you. Thanks. Why don't you have some guy in your life? I don't know. You don't seem... (David) What? Faggy. Neither do you. [Chuckles] You're going to be mentioned in the paper again. How do you know? I have the mutant power of predicting the future. How 'bout predicting when I'm gonna see these paintings of yours? Why is that such a big deal to you? I love talent, man, talented people. What if you don't like my work? I'm pretty sure I will. [Background rock music] You know, l... Yeah? My last year of high school. This new guy, my friend. I think maybe we were kind of in love. Really? Not like fags in love. Like guys, you know? Lots of guys have those kinda things when they're young. Really? Oh, yeah. You ever fuck around with him? No. Night, buddy. Night, Matt. (woman) # This is the beginning of me. # # Yet somehow it's the ending of my freedom, freedom. # # What, is that all? # # I was found, and now I'm lost; I'm lost inside. # # For every wish, it's freedom, freedom. # # Oh, oh, oh, oh. # # I will lay down all my dreams, # # and dream the dreams you want me to. # # And I will lay down at your side # # and wait for you to tell me that you love me. # # Love me. # # Looking at the definition, I have drawn # # my own conclusions about freedom, freedom. # # What, is that all? # # To be loved and to belong to someone, # # somehow makes me strong as freedom, freedom. # # Oh, oh, oh, oh. # # I will lay down all my dreams and dream # # the dreams you want me to, # # and I will lay down at your side # # and wait for you to tell me # # that you love me, love me. # # There is a fine line between love and obsession. # # The more that I need you, # # the more I become your possession. # # I will lay down all my dreams, # # and dream the dreams you want me to, # # and I will lay down at your side # # and wait for you to tell me that you love me. # # I will wait for you to love me. # # I've got something you should see. What? A painting. Tonight? Let me handle it. [Exhaling deeply] [Background techno music] Are you almost done? Those tables look like they might be in for the long haul. And we've got to rotate everything in the beer coolers. Shit, honey, I'm exhausted. Why don't you go on ahead? I'll meet you at home. Don't be late. No promises. You stay out of trouble. Your family got money or something like that? Something like that. This place is amazing. Thanks. I mean, what more could an artist want? Oh, sorry. I thought you had the radio on. My pig daughter, Scrunta. You came into the restaurant. That's right. I'm Matt. Shannon. I didn't know you knew each other. David's been kind enough to front me a room down the hall. Drink? Oh, no. Thanks. I was just... off to bed. Nice to meet you. You too. She's sexy. - She has a dick. - What? She was born a man but believes there's a woman's soul in her body, and she's spent her entire adult life trying to let her out. She's got a dick? Stay with the tour. So when does Shannon get a twat? I don't know if she will. (Matt) Why not? Shannon tested HIV plus about nine years ago. Her lover died of it. They don't really recommend surgery for people with some of Shan's health problems. I thought that AIDS was nearly cured or something. No, you just read about it less. What is this? The names of everyone I know who have died of AIDS. Shit. Yeah. You HIV positive? No. Good. What were you gonna show me? Oool. I have to unveil it. Sure. Fuck! You painted that? Yeah. I'm beautiful. Yeah. Fuck. What? I'm getting a hard-on. [Panting] Good. I am straight. I don't mind. I went to David's for a drink. I didn't think you'd mind after we stayed late and everything. I was worried. We just lost track of time. (Violet) I didn't know if you were in an accident or if someone broke into the restaurant or what. I'm fine. You know, the night my father left my mother, he just never came home from work. Jesus, Vi, I didn't think it'd be a big deal. You said you were tired. I assumed you'd be sleeping. Went up to his place? He had this painting he wanted me to see. He didn't come on to you or anything like that, did he? Fuck no. Just kidding. You really should lock your door. That is an alarmingly beautiful painting. Isn't this... Yes, it's the married guy from the restaurant. You're painting the married guy from the restaurant. Toke? You wouldn't happen to be getting fucked regularly and be in intense emotional pain, would you? No. You must never sleep with him, no matter how much you want to. He is a married man. He has a wife. Is he a fag? Is he? Oh, God. I hate it when women marry fags. It's so... insidious. Is he in love with you? Is he? No. And he's not a fag. You don't fool me. I hate it when men fall in love with each other. It's so much easier for them, you know? All that shit that drives women crazy makes perfect sense to them. You haven't slept with him, have you? No. David? No. Is this a party? You okay? Just a headache. Just look at this painting. My dear! (Kryla) Now look me in the eye and tell me he is not in love with his subject. (Shannon) So what if he is? The subject is married. (Shannon) And an adult. He took a vow. How many honestly monogamous men have you met? Bitch. You're being awfully Ohristian about this. What about Mrs. Married Guy? Will you invite her to the opening? Who said anything about an opening? It would be criminal to paint something that brilliant and not show it. Oould be major. I have to get back to work. That'd be my cue to leave. Where are you off to? Dinner with Mr. Internet. Oh, he's back? We spoke on the phone for an hour yesterday. Don't call me in the morning. Ruff! [Giggles] Straight people and gay people. Mmm, mixed marriages rarely work. Oan't be any more fucked up than gay relationships. Whatever, it doesn't... Oh. What? I'm feeling a bit fall-down-and-hit-my-headish. I think you better call my doctor. [Background piano music] (Kryla) The fucker didn't show then didn't call, didn't answer my emails, nothing. Never trust a lawyer called Mr. Internet. But he seemed so real-time. Men are such fascinating creatures. Too bad they're all pricks. Really. You notice anything strange about David recently? Strange? He seems distant. I think he's in the process of learning he can't leap tall buildings in a single bound. He's just learning that now? Men. That's not bad. Why are you trying on wigs anyway? I have this potential brain thing. Potential brain thing? Oancer, P.M.L., something. Fuck. Really. And the doll thing is... Just something I collect. I always have. So it's not some post-modern comment on feminism or something? Jesus, no. I just like a doll's life. It's perfect, you know. Steady boyfriend. Lovely home. Lots of clothes. Right, and you've had the diner how long? Just about a year. It was a wedding gift from my mother. Is this gonna be weird now? I feel sort of weird. Me too. Let's just forget it. (Kryla) Working with your spouse isn't easy. Do you and Matt ever reach a point where you want to strangle each other? Never. No, Matt's always been easy to get along with. So you both maintain outside interests? Outside interests? Well, I guess you've never owned a diner before. (Kryla) Can't say that I have. So it was a one-off thing? Yeah, sorry. No problem. (Kryla) He must have girlfriends. Matt must have guy friends. All we have is each other really. You don't ever find that limiting? No. You make it sound like the perfect life. (Violet) Well, I'm trying. (Kryla) Thanks so much, Violet. The doll thing really resonates. When will it run? Saturday's Lifestyle section. To all the dead people. How were we to know mindless ass-fucking and intravenous drug use would lead to such heartbreak? I swallowed a fortune. You ever sorry? For being an escort, for marrying a biker? Tom was the best thing that ever happened to me, even if he was a part-time junkie. You're beautiful. I'm incomplete. I don't think Tom ever saw you as anything but a woman. Tom's not here. I love you the way you are. Whatever you are. We think we know fucking everything. We think we've got it all figured out. But we don't know shit. Hear, hear. [Chamber music] [Applause] Thank you. It is with great pleasure that I dedicate this work by one of our most infamous and controversial artists to the Province of Manitoba. [Applause] [Cameras flashing] Is your friend on drugs? Almost constantly. That is the weirdest painting I've ever seen. I suspect our editor will agree with you. She won't run it if she doesn't get it. I'll get them to go with a shot of David. He hasn't done any publicity in a while. Oh, my God! What? Superman's gonna tell Lois who he really is? I thought that's what marriage was all about. No secrets. Sure, right. I always thought it was kinda weird she never figured it out. (David) Shit. You never said you were famous. You never asked. I knew it. It's not that hard to be famous in Winnipeg. What the hell are you doing working here? It's a long story. Jesus. But I think maybe it's time I moved on. What? I'm giving you my notice. Oh, no. It's okay. I mean, we don't mind. You're going to have to hire more waiters anyway. Three can't handle this place anymore. I'll hang around for a day or two until you get them. We'll miss you. We'll all survive. [Traffic noise] You don't have to leave. Yes, I do. [People talking in background] [Footsteps pattering] These are pretty good. They suck. I never knew you were this good. Put it away. Hon... Put it away! Sorry. I didn't mean... Why don't you go see David? He's busy. (Shannon) Got you something. Superman reveals all to Lois. You know they're selling for 15 bucks now? And when did comic fans gets so scary? Those kids masturbate too much. You can just tell. Why don't you just call him? It's better this way. Being miserable? Not painting? My cocktail's not working anymore, and my viral load is going up. Time for a whole new cocktail. Time for a new array of stunning side effects. Fuck. I can't keep doing this. We'll work it out. Why bother? Don't talk like that. [Doorbell buzzing] It's him. How do you know? X-ray vision. I like women. I've always liked women. I've never wanted to do anything like this before except for Randy in high school. Maybe fag and lesbian aren't nouns. Maybe they're verbs. But there's something about you... the things you say, the way you look at me, make me feel... These paintings. What about cheating on Violet? This is different. How? You're a man. What do you want, Matt? I feel like my skin knows your skin. I assume this means you're not dumping me. You'd never show those paintings, would you? I mean, to the public. I thought you liked them. Love them. But you couldn't... I mean... Might be my best work. (Matt) It's too scary. I won't show them if you don't want me to. Promise? Promise. Clank I think I love you, David. Me too. [Soft rock music] # # Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. [Breathing heavily] Yeah. [Moaning] # # Yeah. [Breathing heavily] I gotta piss. Don't forget to lift the goddamn toilet seat! [Flushing] I'm not 11 years old. How's David? Good. Maybe the three of us could do something sometime. Maybe. How can you do that without looking at me? I look at you all the time. But I don't pose or anything. I know what you look like, Matt. (Dr. Smithers) Shannon, until we can find out what this shadow on your brain is, we'll have to postpone the surgery. Again? For how long? We have no way of knowing. If surgery is required or chemotherapy, we have no way of telling how long your body will take to heal. We can't postpone it again. We have to. I'm sorry. This isn't going to happen, is it? You have to be patient. I'm tired of being patient. Fuck. [Soft instrumental music] (Matt) I'm not hurting you? (David) It's not that big. (Matt) Funny, funny. [Both moaning] # # [breathing heavily] (Matt) This is great. (David) Oh, yeah. [Moaning continues] # # I think there was more chance of this sex change actually happening when I used to pray to Satan to turn me into Wonder Woman. Two things in the world I know for sure: If you dye your hair once, you'll never stop, and if you're born with a cunt, you're fucked. You missed nothing. I don't believe that. Shannon, I did something bad. I was sort of instrumental in having the picture run David's paper. I really have limited interest in all of this. Do you think I should apologize? I don't care. Okay, okay, okay. I'll apologize. You coming? Sure. Okay as usual. Does it bother you that I'm with someone else? Sometimes. Why don't you let me fuck you now? No. Why not? It's not something I've even fantasized about. I hardly think I should be punished for your lack of imagination. Get out of here! Oome on. You know you want to. Stop it. (Kryla) David... Oops. You! You. (Kryla) Where'd you tell you wife you were going? The hockey game? (Matt) Get out. Or does she know about this? Just leave me out of whatever this is. What if someone told her? (David) Come on, Kryla! You're both fucking liars. (Matt) This is fucked up! Just calm down. She's gonna tell my fucking wife! She's just mad. She'll walk it off. I didn't know you knew each other. She had no business coming here. Is she gonna write about this too now? No. What do I do if she goes to Vi? Maybe you should tell Violet yourself. I can't do this anymore, David. What? I don't love you. Matt, you said... I lied. [Rock music] # # What the fuck were you thinking? I wasn't fucking thinking about you guys, okay? What's wrong? [Glass shattering] My leg feels funny. Shan, what's wrong? Aah! Shannon? (Shannon) Oareful, blood. Fuck the blood. Oan I still get a coffee? Sure. Alone? Matt likes a night to himself every once in a while. Thanks for the story. Are you happy? What kind of question is that? Are you? Yeah. Have a nice night. [Lock clicks] You're home early. How was your night? The strange reporter came in. What for? It was kind of weird. Weird, how? She wanted to know if I was happy. That's it? Yeah. [Scoffs] (Violet) You happy, Matt? I'm happy. Survey says brain cancer or P.M.L. If it's cancer, they might be able to do something about it. If it's P.M.L., the virus will eat my brain, and I will gradually lose my ability to walk, hear, and speak. Luckily, I will retain my ability to drool and make disturbing animal-like noises. Fuck. They can't be absolutely sure unless I let them drill a hole in my skull so they can do a biopsy on my brain. Fuck! [Moaning] I love you. I mean it. How're you feeling? Like someone drilled a hole in my head. You? Same. You have to show them. I promised. We all lie when we have to. Yeah? Yeah. Mm, looks great. I guess David's been busy with the show. Show? (Violet) Let's go. Hey, they're gonna kill Superman. [Train whistle blowing] What if Violet sees them? Don't I get some say in what happens to them? You didn't sit for them. You didn't create them. I inspired them. You don't pay the fruit when you do a still life. You promised. You said you loved me. Take advantage of it. You could be famous. I don't want to be a famous fag. You didn't mind when I made your restaurant famous. I'll wreck them. I will. I'll break in You even think about touching one of those paintings, and it won't be your restaurant that'll be in the gossip columns. It'll be stories about you sucking my cock. You got that? If you want, if it'll keep you from showing those paintings, I'll come back. Do whatever you like. How did I ever drown in someone so shallow? David, Please. Think of Violet. Did you? [Electric guitar music] # # What? David's show. Yeah. The paintings, they're of me. You? Nude. [Chuckling] What? (Matt) We've been sleeping together. You've been sleeping with David? (Matt) Yes. David, our waiter? I love you. You're a fucking fag. I'm not a fucking fag. David's our friend! Why would you... Jesus. Violet... I love you. Don't. Look, I-I knew it was wrong. I don't know why I did it. I've never done anything like this before in my life. Never. But that doesn't mean that I don't love you. I love you more than I ever have right now. I can never trust you again. (Matt) You can... What if you gave me AIDS? He doesn't have AIDS. We didn't do anything unsafe. Did he fuck you in the ass? No! (Violet) You fucked him, though? Oocksucker! Slam! We can work through this. Work through this? Yeah. Do you love him? No. I want a divorce. No. You'll give me a divorce. I guarantee it. I love you too. Give me your keys. It's not the same thing. Give me your keys to the apartment, Matt. Violet, don't leave me. I'm sorry. Go away, Matt. [Suspenseful music] # # [panting] David. It's time. No. It's P.M.L., David. There's nothing they can do. They'll find something. Not this time, baby. You're all I've got. This isn't about you, David. I know. No, you don't. I can't do this anymore. You can live a long time before it gets really bad. But I can't live a long time with a penis. Not anymore. I'm too tired. Not yet, Shan. It's time. Have a beer. Get a room. Oall the ambulance from wherever you are in the morning. I'll use forgotten Kryptonian technology to suck the virus out of your body. You're not Superman, David. Let me go. No. You told me you could do this. Please. It's what I want. Thank you. [Soft instrumental music] # # Mean ya. Love it. Go. # # (Kryla) You said you weren't sleeping with him. It was none of your business. Friends don't lie to each other. We all lie to each other. It's what we're taught. It's how we learn to communicate. What you were doing was wrong. Why? Because they're married? Yes. You're an alcoholic. You're a drug addict. You're bitter. You're a fag. You can't change that, not even by falling in love with a straight guy. What bothers you more, that I fell in love or the fact that I fell in love with someone who considers himself straight? Please. You came to the restaurant; you made sure I was in the paper... Christ, you even walked in on us when we were fucking! You were not supposed to lie to me. Not to me. I'm your best friend. Shannon's dead. What? She's doing it right now. Why didn't you tell me? She asked me not to tell anyone. I wanted to say good-bye. She was avoiding that. Right, but you get what you want. Meaning? Someone else to mourn. Another excuse to feel sorry for yourself. Fuck off, Kryla! Asshole! Fag hag! You know... [tsks] I don't like you. I haven't for a very long time. [Electric guitar music] # # [panting] [Siren wailing] [Doorbell buzzing] [Water dripping] [Breathing heavily] [Steam hissing] [Water dripping] [Somber music] # # [breathing heavily] # # [dripping noises] [Gasps] [Suspenseful music] # # [applause] It's a... That's a hard question. For me, it's about letting go, I guess. It's connected to grief and change. Excuse me. Violet. I never saw him like that. I'm sorry. You were supposed to be our friend. (woman) Taxi. I just wanted to see the paintings. They're very good. What was wrong with me? Didn't I love you enough? Am I ugly? When you married me, you said you'd love me forever. I never once didn't love you. He loves you as much as I did. Why do you say that? Take another look at the paintings, Matt. [Door opening] I knew you'd show eventually. I hate openings. I make a press appearance and go. They're great. Glad you got to see the series all together. Violet was here. (Matt) I saw her. Something like this would've happened even without the showing, Matt. I know. Sorry. I still love you. No. I don't think you do. I think you just don't like the idea of me not loving you anymore. Don't you? I don't know. I want to try again. It's too fucked up. If there's anything I can do or say... Matt... it's me. I'm sorry. [Soft instrumental music] # # [traffic noises] # # [sobbing] No! [Sobbing] [Crying] [Crying continues] [Sobbing] [Crying] [Fire crackling] [Intense instrumental music] # # [cars passing] [Soft instrumental music] # # [train whistle blowing] [Door opens] I hear the canvases sold in minutes. (David) It was a single collector, so it doesn't really count. They really were fabulous. So was your piece about Shannon. I hoped you'd like it. I brought you something. The rebirth of Superman. Apparently, he's like a bad smell... just won't go away. When did you do this? Finished yesterday. Why? For the new owner. You're leaving. I need to find new ways to stimulate myself, ones that produces less casualties. You and me both, pal. I want to be friends again. Me too. But you won't be here. I don't have to be here for us to be friends. I'm sorry about those things I said. Don't be. We've both said things that should've been said a long time ago. Will you call? Yes. Things are gonna be all right. It's gonna be okay. I know. Love ya. Mean it.
