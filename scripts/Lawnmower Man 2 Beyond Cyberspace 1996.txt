The investors have financed the development of the chip By law, if they can't be repaid, the patent belongs to them. You can't give it to them! They will pollute the vision of everything my chip stands for Here is an opening! It has fire marks on it! Break it in! This way. We got a live one over here - Get the gurney out. Pull gurney out. We have to repair that shattered maxillary fracture. We're gonna lose him. We're gonna fix that damn artery We're losing the vital signs, get me RD forty. Heart stopped. He need to defibrillate. - Clear! - One, two, three! Patient is a male. Late twenties... multiple amputee, smoke lesions on the lungs... and third degree burns over eighteen per cent of his body. Transferred from County? They amputated both of his legs and reconstructed his face. - Well, what's the veredict? - It's hard to tell... so many different pathways through the interface only one way to find out. Hello, can you hear me? Peter Peter pumpkin eater? - What does it mean? - It means he can hear us. What is your name? - Peter Peter pumpkin eater. Maybe his name is Peter. I'll try this. "Had a wife, but couldn't keep her". Jobe... Hello, Jobe. Jobe, tell me about yourself. Empty space. It is all just empty space inside... like it is been erased. Try to visualize all the people and places that you have met. Just relax and let the images come to you. - Jobe! Hey, Jobe! - Hi, Peter. - Look what I've got. Is that the new Cosmic Man? - Yeah, it is great! - Thanks, buddy. Happy birthday, Jobe. Make a wish Excuse me... Jobe. I am Jonathon Walker. I run this place... I own the patent to the Chyron chip and you can build it. Jobe, there is nothing to be afraid of... Virtual Reality will rehabilitate your mind your body... You'll be alright, I promise... just concentrate. Okay? We'll try some music. Access granted. LOS ANGELES. The future. Hey, Matt... Matt! - Come here. Have you seen Peter? No, sorry... Get down on your knees, repent! Man destroys man. Before the end. Get down and pray for forgiveness before... Thank you. Your videophone access code is approved. Yeah! That was awesome! Here, let me see... Cool! Here. - Crap! Man are you okey? Are you crazy, Peter? You know it can't hurt me. - How long, Travis? - Right now. Did you get it? Just shoulder sifted it on the way over. You are a saint. Thank you. Come on, let's go inside... I've got his password you got the access code... Man, we are set. What's up, Travis? How about a taste of remote presence, my friends? All hooked up and ready to go. All right. Et's use the Cybercycle disc. - No way, I am flying. - Me too. I am waitin' for this all day. Please enter videophone access code... trapdoor access to Cyberscape granted... ten, nine, eight, seven... six, five, four, three... two, one... Trapdoor opened. Enter now. - Peter, what's happening? - What's going on? Who is doing this? Shawn, the Cybercycles. Harvey, put in the Cybercycle disc... Harvey, can you hear me? Put in the Cybercycle disc now! No one jacks-out until we find who is doing this! You are alive! How can that be? There isn't time, Peter. Need your help. I am diyng. What do you mean dying? The Cyberspace is dying and so am I right along with it... I am trapped here, Peter. You have to help me. - I do not get it. - I need you to find Trace. - What? Doctor Benjamin Trace. When the Cyberspace dies, so do I. What if he won't jack-in? I'm building his chip Chyron, I need the Egypt link. - Peter? - Peter! I do not think he's breathing. - What do we do? - Let's try CPR. - Hurry up, we have no time. Alright. One, two, three, four, five... Breath! Breath, Peter! One, two, three, four, five. Breath! It is not working. One, two, three, four... Come on, get up. Are you OK? If you knew you were in danger, you should have jacket-out! It was the most exciting tele- presence I've ever lived. I want to talk to Halloway person to person, okay? I don't want any other nonsense. We are running out of time. Well, Senator Greenspan. How wonderful to see you again... Welcome to the Virtual Light Institute. My head of research and development, Doc. Cori Platt... and this is Jennifer. Please come with me, Senator. Senators, Virtual Light... until now, no one has had he ability to create... an entire computer network based ithin Virtual Reality... I'll render all other systems obsolete. Virtual Reality has evolved from a simulation to an actual place. Watch your head, those monitors'll kill you... So, it is like a whole new world out there. Full of interesting possibilities I understand. I love a man that does his homework. Do not you, Doctor? Well, Senator, what is holding us back is final... congressional approval of our license. This must be the Chyron chip that everybody is talking about. The key to my Virtual Light Uplink. Since the information superhighway... has left people feeling isolated from their fellow man... the Virtual Light Institute will bring cultures together... in one continuous Virtual Enviroment. And this is our main control room... hub of all our operations here at Virtual Light. I am still a little unclear as to ow this fits together. Well, I am sure Doctor Platt will enlighten you. Jennifer, please. The outer circle represents the real world... the inner one, Virtual Reality... the spokes are the different pathways between the two... the Chyron chip will open up these pathways simultaneously... so a network based inside VR can be accessed by everyone. So, next miracle... When you hook into the library of my Virtual city... you hook into every library in the world... the chip will bring everything on line for everyone. Well, yes, it is very pretty, onathon, but I think... we'd be placing quite a concentration of power in your lap My lap is your lap, Senator. - Twinkie? How did it go? Walker makes me feel like the star poodle on his dog show. - At least you get top billing. - Walker always gets top billing. The Chyron chip and designing the Virtual City. I do not mind. I care about how other people see you, how they perceive you. That's your world, Dr. Platt, not mine. My world is in here... out there people look at me and they see half a person... but in here, they see what I want them to see... - how I really am. - I don't see half a person. - That's your world. - Good night, Jobe What do you want? You sure don't look like the ather of Virtual Reality to me. - What? - You are Dr. Benjamin Trace, right? - He's dead. - Dead? That's not what they said in the Internet. They said he was here. The Benjamin Trace you want is resting in peace. I suggest you get on that cool bike of yours and go on home. Don't know what Jobe was thinking he's just as crazy as this guy. Trippy fool invented some kind of Chyron chip. - What did you say? Chyron chip? Come inside. - So, what's your name, kid? - Peter... Doc. Call me Trace. Well, Peter, it's all in here. All the answers - in the water, in the air... - The reason I came is because. My friend Jobe is dying. You're he only one who could save him. You seem a bit young to know anything about the Chyron chip. - Well, Jobe told me about it. - Who is Jobe? He was our lawnmower man back when my mom was still alive... he was my best friend, but now he's stuck in Virtual Reality. - What does he know about it? - He is building it. - He is building it? - That's what he said. I need you I don't live that life anymore. That technology just consumes you I need your help. You can find me at the 3rd st. Station. Tunnel eleven, if you change your mind. Doctor Benjamin Trace. Only he can stop this. - What if he won't jack-in? Tell him I'm building his chip. - My dog does not stink. - Yes, it does, Shawn... - the funck is burning my eyes. - It does not stink! I looked at him and I almost went blind. Harvey used... to be a poodle. He looks like a Chihuahua on steroids. Who is it? You know this guy, Peter? Back off. This is the guy Jobe old me about! - You all live down here? - This is just our summer cottage. - I love your ventilation system. Listen, this guy can help us. Adults have betrayed me my whole life. You know that, Peter. Look, Travis, you don't have to trust him. You must trust Peter. So, you are the Einstein of VR? I'll take that as a compliment, Travis... You know, Einstein made a few mistakes himself. - What are these? - Man, you must be a dinosaur! The electroplates on the sides? They hit your temple and tap into certain neurons, giving you full neuro-sensory involvement. - You can actually feel? - Exactly... See, that's why we have to save Jobe, though. Because he's real in there. He dies in there, he is going to die out there. Are you sure Jobe need saving? What are you trying to say? Jobe wouldn't lie to me. You said you couldn't trust any adults He's not like you. I mean, he's like a kid. He was until... - Until what? - Until my next door nieghbor did some experiments with him in VR and turned him from a simpleton into a genius. We are wasting time. You can ask him yourself. - Ready! Let's hook it up. Let's do it. - Doc, here is your stuff. No, I do not want to go into VR - Why not? I'm not ready yet. It is scary. - I might get lost or something. - Fine, I'll go in. Back door access to Cyberspace granted, please stand by. Welcome to my world, Peter. Did you bring the good Doctor? - No, he's watching. - Jack-in, jack-off. Scared of the boogy man, doctor? You can at least humor me with a point of view, can not you? It is a pleasure to finally meet you. I feel like we're almost I am blushing... family. - I do not think so, Jobe. - Don't be sure."Incest", the game... the whole family can play. My brother is my Daddy. Doc, we are both unwanted, under appreciated and... ahead of our time. And the only difference is your time was then. - My time is now. - It's a short ride. Enjoy it. I plan to enjoy it for a long time. I've found the secret to... - inmortality in the Chyron chip. - Where is the Chyron chip? Come with me, won't you? There she is... Miss Chyron chip! It is taken years of work, but our Chyron chip is a reality. Look what I am doing, Doctor. Sn't it amazing? You do not look like you are in danger. What do you want? Egypt. Do not hold back on me. It is a hidden "nano-routine" encoded into the design of he Chyron chip. - I'm not going to help you. - You share Egypt with me and I'II... share with you technological knowledge beyond your dreams. This is your worl too, Doctor. Your work helped create it. My work is to build it. Now, tell me. What does Egypt mean? I'm not going to tell you. You don't understand its power I do, Doctor. And in 3 days I'll be in every system in the world Tell me what Egypt means, doctor, before I get really pissed off! Get out of here, Peter! It is getting out of control! Something is wrong. I've neverseen Jobe like that before. Stop it! I can stop it! I thought you said the trains didn't run through these tunnels. They do not! Oh, my God, It is heading right for us! Get out of here! But this is our home! Dispatch, do something! Implement emergency procedures immediately. Dispatch shut all systems down. Disengage... Come on! Jade, Peter, hurry up! The game is afoot. Closed track. Code red. The caboose is loose. Shawn, let's go, come on! I can not leave Harvey here! Come on, Trace, get out of there! Let's get out of here, it is going to blow! Now, let's deal with the true believers. Show me all the contributors to fundamental world religions over. The past five years. And each user thinks that they have total privacy. Every time anyone logs onto Virtual Light Uplink... we'll know everything about them. Show me all hypocriticaldemocrats making over 300,000 a year. That train was no accident, was it? Not a chance. Man, now we have lost our home and the Cyberspace. I bet Jobe did it, so he could build this his city. Like this world didn't suck enough already. I think that's just a taste of what he could do if. It can not get any worse. W What's with this Egyptthing, Doesn't he need it from you? If Jobe's worried about Egypt, it means he's about to use it to its full hideous potential. Which is? Enter every system in the world and take over through VR. So is there any way to stop him or... should we just start digging ourown graves? We've got to stael him the Chyron chip before he figures out Egypt. Federal Library? If we could use their computers we'll find the chip. That's right, Peter, let's go. Initiate image regeneration. You have to help me. Isn't that just like a recording? We have to strip away the layers within the program to discover who the software that Jobe used to enter VR was licensed to. We have a problem. I can not get past the memory lock to isolate the chain. Simple. Just enhance the memoryindex. What have we got hare? Actualize data. Five... Here we go... Execute worm function. Enhance. Redimensionalize variables. All we have to do now is access Datatronic Systems. I am right with you, Doc... there is our registered wner. Platt. I am accessing phone listings, now. We have forty three Platts. See if you have a Cori Platt. No Cori, but we have 3 C. Platts. One is a PhD. Trace, pull over. Aren't we going to Dr. Platt's apartment? First we have to get tracker so she can lead us to the chip. It is locked. - How are they going to do this? - No problem. My brother can... handle it. He is great at this kind of stuff. It is unlocked. Let's go shopping. Well, the extra day I got Greenspan to stay was useless... that liberal idiot is on his way back to Washington right now... to recommend that they rescind our license to go on line. If we lose that license, we aredead. Accesing LAX Reservations file. Passenger Robert Greenspan. Flight three-seven-zero-one. Access number three seven zero one flight navigation computer. Access denied. Access granted. Reset system. Auto pilot descent from thirty thousand feet. Warming. Altitude 15,000 feet. Execute. We have lost the instrument panel Activate auto pilot. Auto pilot activated. Descent rate increasing. Override auto pilot. I can not! Contact approach. Declare an emergency. Oh, my God! Open top secret files. Request data transcripts. Jobe, Virtual Light. You are awfully nosey, aren't you, Guillermo? Hi, you haven't forgotten me? No for lack of trying. How have you been? Fine, Ben. What do you want? I need to talk to you. About Jobe - He's not what you think he is. Neither were you. He's very dangerous, Cori. Hardly. And what makes you think you can just show up here... and entertain a conversation with me? - You have right to be angry - I am not angry. I am leaving! Let's go. You look terrific. More beautiful than I remember. Has Jobe used up all the memory in your system? Every printed word, thought and deed in human history... couldn't begin to fill up the type of memory we are using. Because of my Chyron chip. I heard you deserted that project just like you did us. I am sorry you lost the patent. I do not want pity, Cori. I want the chip. And you want me to help you get it. Forget it. You should know what Jobe is up to. Do not patronize me, Trace. I'm not your student anymore. He tried to kill me, Cori... you musn't not let go him go on line. Check his data file... you'll be surprised of what you find there. - How are we doing? - Cool. The tracker is working. That's where we have to break into to get the chip? Do you have any ideas? We could have Jade tap into the County engineering and pull up... the blue prints on that place. That's good idea. You are cleverer than you look. - Where is David? - I don't know. He was just here. Take that down to the mail room. Arthur, it looks like you have been going at it for hours. Walker's orders. You don't do anything on this project withuot my authorization. Can I speak with you for a moment? I do take my responsabilities just as seriously as you do. You do your job, a nd let me do mine. What exactly is your job? We've got a problem. All available memory capacity on the I ten eighty six S is gone. That's imposible. I know that. What's is going on? I didn't authorize this equipment. - What happened to the memory? - I forgot. - Walker's behind schedule. - We are not behind the schedule. He is losing memory and he wants Jobe working around the clock on the Virtual Light I'm not going to discuss this with you. He's going on line tomorrow. Mr. Walker... Mr. Walker... I think you have made a mistake, Doctor. No. I think you have made a mistake. Why wasn't I notified that you intend to put Jobe on line? We'II, you are just a scientist. I am a businessman. And Jobe is a human being. And every day that VR goes unfinished is costing me millions in potential revenue. He's showing signs of instabilities. I am worried. Well, the man is at a distinct disadvantage. You've been profiting off this man's misery for years... how many times have you postponed his prosthetics legs? I couldn't have him getting up and walking out on us now... could I? Why do not we discuss this after Jobe goes on line? Requets file, Jobe. Access denied. Code 7. Override code seven, three-nine-four-two. Access granted. Please wait. File 248, Jobe empty. Contest erased. Whose authorization? Jonathon Walker. Cooper, you finish the security and go tosection twenty-four. - Dr. Platt! Henry! You startled me. Just making my rounds. Is everything okay? I was just dropping off some production charts for the week. - Good night, Henry. Good night. - Are you all right? Yes, we'll be just fine. Wait! Let me... Me again. I was right, wasn't I? Jobe is expanding his memory base Get out of the car. Good, I caught you. A guard reported seeing you in my office this evening. You could have come up with a better excuse Jobe is going on line tomorrow, so I wanted to deliver... - them to you myself. - I see. Well. Good. Be sure you get some rest. We have a big day tomorrow. You are working for Jonathon Walker? He stole my patent. He didn't exactly steal it. He was one of the investors that took me to court. Get out of the car! I was right about the memory base I am right about Jobe. I don't think you or Walker understand the power... Get out. I thought you were better than this, Cori. You stole a gun? No, man. It is a camera, check it out. Cool. Alright. Let's do it. Execute virtual surveillance system loop. Your attention, please. A coolant test will be run... on levels eight through ten at OH three hundred hours. Thank you. Lieutenant Martin to Security... Sub level four. You have to understand, with those tubes you have to be heli-arch... about three inches wide. Guess you do not realize is that... an alumnium tubing about eight millimeters thick. That is a special laser alarm. Sensitive to anything above 0C. Come. I have an idea. It's Doctor Platt. I seemto have left my key card in the lab. Yes, Doctor. I'm sorry, we didn't know it was you. Thank you. You ready? I don't think so. This isn't one of your best ideas. I wouldn't trust anybody else. You can do it. Grab it! Grab it! What are you doing? He will kill them! What is going on? - By the way, who are you? - Security. Sealing sector four. Sector four secured. You want the chip? Put your guns down... Put them down or I will smash it. Put them down now! Slide them forward. You have the card? What now? Here! - Where? - Go on. Go. Why did I let you back into my life? You find me irresistible. You got the chip? Good work. You are bleeding. Let us get out of there. - What is that? - Just some dirt. Bring it to me! Get that dirt, you idiots! Take off your shirt. What do you have in mind? I need to stop this bleeding and I'm not going to use my shirt. Do I know you, guys? - I owe you an apology, Cori. - You could say that. - Do you mind? - Not at all. Okay, so apologize. I am sorry, Cori. I really am. I did not want to see anybody. I was too ambitious, I was naive Stupid. That too. Thanks for the medical attention. You are welcome for the medical attention. Race you to the top of the hill. Pretty neat, huh? It's incredible... They were able to bypass the capability protection registers? It makes me wonder if I could have ever finished it myself. The chip was supposed to make things better for them. Ironic. Still maybe it could. What did he do here? That's where Jobe merged the nano-matching hardware. He couldn't have. There is no trans-matrix. There isn't. Something's wrong. It should be there. So you lost the chip. You idiot. Do you honestly think I'd entrust something that important to you? Voila! People want a show... and now that Jobe has solved the link, the chip can be activated. Now, get out of my sight. Any progress? Jobe is tracking down the intruders And you are a genious. Yes, I know. I think it is time we call the President. Try to get Virtual Light Europe. - Where? - Anywhere. Uplink, England, Virtual Light... Nothing. Greetings, Mr. President. And thank you for joining us in this momentous occasion. I am happy to be here. I was shocked to hear about Greenspan's dreadful accident... I know how much he wanted to be a part of what we are doing here. But, "la vie continue"... We will be joined by hundreds of others prominent people... who'll be jacking-in from all over the country... so, if you are ready, don your eyephones... and we can begin. - I am... - Just relax. Ladies and gentlemen... Welcome to Virtual Light... We stand in the face of a new age... The future is one world... one thought, one mind... Behold. The future is now! Twelve hours to Global interface. It is all taken care of. The foreign marketplace will be secure only when they place... their money in your hands. Excellent work, Jobe. - It is already started to happen What's that supposed to mean? It means that Jobe must have figured a way around Egypt. And he's using the chip to enter... every system around the world, replacing it with himself It takes about twelve hours for the interface to complete. Once complete it is irreversible. Walker is going to stop him. Are you crazy? Who do you think is doing this with him? Walker is a businessman and Jobe is bad for business. Come on! What a surprise. I did not expect to hear from you so soon, Doctor. You have to stop Jobe before it's too late. Too late? What happened to your sense of loyalty, Cori? You wouldn't know the meaning of the word, Walker. Is that Doctor Benjamin Trace? Listen, Walker, you have to take Jobe off line immediately. I would love to accommodate you, Doctor, I really would. But that is not an opinion I can exercise right now. Listen to me, you stupid bastard! If you do not take him off line you will have no options. Are you threatening me, Doctor? No, I'm not. Jobe is. Jobe is a loyal employee. I 'd trust him with my life. You better, because you just gave it to him. Time to get rid of some pesky little roaches. Stop. Back two sectors. Enhance. They check in, but they do not check out. Systems override. Still no response. Control, I need help, I have a Mayday! Control, you need to reply. We are Alpha six! Doctor, we have company. Reference present position. We are going in after him. You have to help me. Override the system! Let's get out of here. I lost frequency. Help me out of here! Two hours to Global Interface. Give me access to all credit accounts. I am sorry, your account is overdrawn. This card is no longer valid. ATM machins... Department of Water and Power. Reports of city wide civil disturbances have been verified. As the police department has gone on full tactical alert. But with automated system failures occurring throughout... the city, response is expected to be slower than usual. Already the violence has taken... several lives and few see an end to thecontinuing chaos. Officials are reporting an outbreak of looting and random... myhem throughout the city, nation and globe. He has finished this city. That's why he waited, so he could offer an alternative. People need hope. If he can destroy our world, we will have to turn to him... a new Messiah in Cyberspace. But you can not live in Cyberspace. Jobe can. He can achieve global interface, we won't have any choice. - Egypt. - Where they built the first dam. - The chip is a dam. Exactly. Come to me all who have burdens. I will set you free. And you will no longer be the children of a lost generation. It is time to take control of the system! There shall be no more authority to oppress you. We can all be the authority. Jack into a new world order. Follow Jobe... Follow Jobe... Escape the violence and greed that threatens to consume you. Come be one with your fellow man. This is true spirituality. There shall be no more authority to oppress you. World economic markets have been taken some of the worst collapses in the history. Jonathon, I have some bad news and I have some bad news. Where are you going? Come back here! Stay here! You can not go anywhere! Come on! Jobe, what the hell is going on? We have lost control. AII the lab files are disappearing! Are you messing with me? Answer me. That is an order. You have no power to give orders. In 100 years your petty financial empire will not mean anything... but I'll still be here. You son of a bitch! Without me you are nothing but a deaf and dumb cripple. I made you and I can unmake you. Twenty minutes to Global Interface... You can't disconnect him. Virtual Jobe will remain inside. You can either heavily sedate him or take him out. If you want to take me out... just ask. Open the door, goddammit! Bastard! Alright. If that is the way you want to play it. Prime alert. Security breach. Code Red. Code Red. All personnel will evacuate the building immediately There are three terrorists on the premises... fully armed and dangerous moving down corridor 6D. Shoot on sight. Repeat, shoot to kill. That son of a bitch. - Sir, there were terrorist here. - We are the terrorists you idiot! Give me that gun. There are three terrorists on the premises. Shoot on sight. Repeat, shoot to kill. Fifteen minutes to Global Interface. Give yourselves to me. Your re-birth in the womb of Cyberspace is a chance for a new beginning. To live in Eden... without hunger, without famine... without temptation! Ten minutes to Global Interface. We have got ten minutes, Cori, you better watch the monitors... Pull the real chip at the exact moment you destroy the Virtual. Check it out, man. Let us look! If we can just jack in to that dome unnoticed... No. Jobe knows all about anyone who jacks into the dome. We have to find another way in. These are the routes for the information superhighway... that lead directly into the dome. You do not have to jack in, Doc. You have a problem jacking into VR? No, I will be fine. I am not going to run away this time. Listen, guys... We are going to follow the superhighway through the city... to where it goes underground all the way into the dome. We'll take this access route follow that up inside and comes the tricky bit. We have to get by Jobe and smash the chip. How are we going to get through the city? Well, how about a little bike ride? Okay, let's do it. Destroying the chip won't stop. What do you really have in mind? The chip gave Jobe the power to go on line. It contains a dam function to prevent the use of absolute power We destroy the chip, we destroy the dam and expose Jobe. I am going to make him angry enough to destroy himself. Trace, we have to go! If you can not, get out, I don't want you disappearing on me again You shall wait no more. The Prophecy has already been fulled. For I have seen the Heavens and a voice of the throne saving... There will be chaos in the streets! And in the final days, the material world will fade away... and only Cyberspace will remain. In the womb of Cyberspace is a chance for a new begining... to live in Eden without hunger... without famine. With me... you will find refuge. We came to save to you, Jobe. In here, I am the savior. I will crush you! You are just thelawnmower man, Jobe. The lawnmower man is dead! By the way... I don't have to worry about Egypt anymore. I simply built around it You destroyed Peter's world. I am going to destroy yours. Six... five... ...four... three... ...two... one... You are a fool, Trace. I don't need the Chyron chip anymore. I have become the chip. You've betrayed, Peter, Jobe. You have sold your soul for nothing. You don't even have enough power to destroy me. Is that all you have got, Jobe? Is that all you have got? Is that the best you can do? What's... happening... to me? Egypt, Jobe. Egypt! Jobe, come here! Make a wish. Make a wish. We are back! Hey, my pal. Well done. I need to see Jobe. Okay. Let us go. There he is. Be careful. Probable pathways to interface... forty thousand... eighty four... He's regressing. Well, isn't that touching? I want the chip. You can keep the rest, for what is worth. We will give you the chip, give us the kid. I really dislike repeating myself Give him the chip. By the way, Doctor Platt, you are fired. I though I lost you, man. Let's go home.
