I don't like this letter. - Why don't you like it? It was posted here, in the village, last night or early this morning. Look at the letterhead. Another anonymous letter. You can go. They're waiting for your letters. Goodbye, doctor. "This letter is your death sentence... "You will die for what you have done. " These things disgust me. What have you done? Six letters in a month and still I'm not dead. It's nonsense... Don't think about it. Who's thinking about it? - Then play. Six in a month... Graphomania. You know all cuckolds are graphomaniacs. An anonymous letter in this village is always dangerous. I think it's a woman. - They're joking. Who's 'they'? Them. Come on guys, let's play. Who's first? I am. DIE Pass. Up to three times. I'm in. - Yes. "To Each His Own" - Two cards. Manno received another anonymous letter. I'm not surprised; he spends all his time chasing after the ladies. That guy sitting in front of us at the bar... do you know him? No, he's not from around here. He just bought some rat poison in the pharmacy... and he's looking at me strangely. - I can see you're scared... but why don't you go to the police, before you start suspecting everyone, even passers by? The police have to investigate... not us. I'll pick you up tomorrow morning, at six. - Okay. Don't keep me waiting like usual. - It's certainly a little strange... why would an outsider come here... to buy rat poison? Right, why? The alarm. More. Did you guess the killer? It was the wife, scheming with her husband's lover. Any more anonymous letters? I'll eat out today. Did you tell anyone where we were going? No. They can find the good spots for themselves... I've got no intention of breaking my back for others. Come on, Sonia. I love Sicily at this hour. You mean you like it without Sicilians. What's wrong with you? I've got a reason to be worried... but you? The problem is we can't even trust our friends anymore. The bigots have confessionals, the Americans have psychoanalysis... but us? Nothing. Who are they? I told you: You can't find a new place without someone else finding out. You see? They followed us. Let's make sure they know we're here, otherwise they might shoot at us. Hey! We're here as well! Antonino... No... I'll take care of it. Uncle, stay here with Luisa. Let me take care of it. Commissioner, I'd like to spare my cousin Luisa, Roscio's wife, the pain. Sure, advocate. Come. Did you find him? - Yes. Lift it. Why? Yes, he's my cousin. My cousin Luisa's husband, Dr. Roscio. Yes, the pharmacist - my friend, Manno. Do you know anything about the anonymous letters? I know what everyone else knows. Manno didn't hide anything. How many did he receive? I don't know. I couldn't tell you. Did you see them? No, no. All I know is Dr. Roscio, my poor cousin, didn't have any enemies, understand? He was a highly respected doctor, I would even say loved... Perhaps he was killed by mistake... because he saw something. The thought of it is unbearable. Do you know if Manno was having an affair? Please, let me go. Did you see, advocate? Did you see what they've done? He didn't have any enemies. It's impossible to get a match on the cartridge cases... there were ten of them, and some were fired by Manno and Roscio. There was a car nearby... we found numerous cigarette stubs... 'Branca'. Branca cigarettes. They killed him! He was my life! Don't be like this, madam. You're making it worse. Open up, Paolo. The inspector's here. You see, inspector? He's been locked up in his room... he doesn't want to see anyone, although I have... Come in, inspector. How do you feel, my son? They were very close. - La Marca. What do you want from me? Any woman in the village will know more. Look, my mother's here, she's well informed... then there are his friends from the village... That's right, you spend very little time in the village. Only in the summer. Sure, the exams last until July and they start again in September... then he teaches in Palermo, you understand, Inspector... He's so tired when he comes home, he takes the train because he can't drive. He's away from all the quarrelling. He's always here reading and writing. Isn't that true, Paolo? Yes, she's trying to say I'm abstracted. That's right... distracted. You have at least heard about the anonymous letters he received? Yes. Did you see one? Did you read any of them? No. Strange. Look in the pharmacy. Why? - Yes, it's simple... he would've kept them there, so his wife wouldn't see them. It's only natural. You mean Mrs. Manno was jealous of her husband? I didn't say that. However... do you know his wife? - Yes. You only need to look at her to not have any doubts! A marriage of convenience. - This is all petty speculation. I'm sorry to have disturbed you. I'll leave you to your meditation. Goodbye. - Goodbye. I almost forgot: I checked the pharmacy, but there was no trace of the letters. Mrs Manno is a very honest woman as far as I know, an unusually virtuous woman but she's ugly, poor her, the ugliest woman God could ever create! And that poor pharmacist was a ways doing his dirty tricks to her right in front of her eyes. She's even naughty! So it's almost sure she destroyed the anonymous letters, to save her reputation as a wife Record everything you see. I want to study it in peace, one at a time. Friends, enemies, the widows, even the notables... That guy with the moustache and dark glasses; who's he? That's Peccorilla, notary. He knows everything about everyone... the guy in front is Zerillo, the bishop's brother... and Pistilli's cousin: "Public Works"... then Corvaia, the richest man in the village. - Who is that tall old man? The one with the medal... talking to Peccorilla, the notary? The retired colonel Dante Selvaggio. Bronze medal, fascist. His daughter married Advocate Maccaluso, the the brother-in-law of His Excellency Loprete. The Lauranas have arrived. What party does Professor Laurana belong to? None, now. He was a Communist. He's difficult to understand. As a Professor, there's not much to say... I would define him as anti-social, going on the information we've received from the political office. Here's the widow Roscio, a beautiful woman. Her husband moved to the village from Palermo just for her... I believe it was against his father's wishes. The great Professor Roscio, the famous optician... he's been retired for many years, as you know, they say he was against him moving out here, as well as the marriage. That's the cousin, Advocate Rosello. They're like brother and sister. Is that what they say? - They say it and it's true. The uncle, arch-priest Don Rosello, looked after them like his children... they spent their entire adolescences in his home. You see? The notables are giving their speeches. ...they had no power, so this can't have been a political crime. It's through a process of elimination that you arrive at an honour killing. But two men shot! One woman cannot cheat on two men at the same time. Two are the cuckolds, but they were born in the singular. So what? It could've been the father and brother of the woman... or two brothers. - Or two hitmen. Two hitmen cost more than a car, an apartment. Okay, but you don't just get poor cuckolds... in this case, the instigators were cuckolds and rich! The poor pharmacist never touched the women of powerful people... farmers, workers, widows. Sick women. Luisa, this isn't an honour killing. Luisa... Luisa, what's wrong? Do you feel ill? This Professor Laurana, how does he get along with the women? Well, he's a man for sure... but he might be impotent. Which one is Rosina? There... to the right of the widow. You see, Commissioner, there are two funerals... but strangely there are three widows. Christ, she's just a kid. She just turned 15 in April. Look behind her, Commissioner. Watch the farmers... an old one and two young ones... Rosina's father and her two brothers. The elder one has previous convictions for damage to property. You follow on behind. - Okay. - It was logical. - Poor them. Who did they get? Who were they? The father and brother of the servant. Who else did you expect to be arrested? It could've been them, or someone else. I think they're innocent. How can you be so sure? I looked at the anonymous letter closely... it was made from pieces cut out of the 'Oservatore Romano'. Since when does a farmer read a newspaper for priests? From a logical point of view, the Professor is right. Then why don't you defend those three? You're a relative of the victim... defend them and they'll be free. I'll do it... then, if my cousin Luisa brings a civil case, I'll find myself going up against her. What if the three they arrested... were illiterate? Because they are illiterate. They'll learn in prison. Excuse me. Tell me? - I want to know... who receives the 'Oservatore Romano'? To be honest, Professor... that's an official secret. I don't want to get into trouble. What trouble? It's for my studies. If that's the case, Professor, we get two copies of 'Oservatore Romano'. One for St. Anna's parish... and the other one is for the high-priest, Advocate Rosello's uncle. That's all? - That's all. Okay, thanks. I kiss your hand. Thank you. It's for my studies. Pity; I thought you'd been converted! No, not yet... but I'm on the right path. I'm looking for an article on Manzoni. All the editions you asked for are there. As you can see, I'm not involved. I don't understand? You understood perfectly. You could put my job in question... yes, it's true: I like antiques, but that's all. Come, Professor, I want to show you something which may interest you... I know you like these things. I found it abandoned in a church in the countryside. Should I have left it to rot? How much is it worth? - I haven't valued it yet... I'm going to keep it for now, I want to enjoy it for a while. There's always time for it to end up in the home of some thief of the public purse. Don't you believe in anything? - Do you? Well, I... what have I got to do with it? I believe in something... perhaps too much... for the times we are in. "This letter is your death sentence. "You will die... "for what you have done. "You will die. " "To Each His Own" What on earth have you been doing for the last two hours? At least I can be alone in my room. Please. Your silence worries me. - Do you think I wrote those letters? Because you think I was capable of doing it. I reconstructed the letter they sent Manno, from the same newspaper. But why? - Why? There are three illiterate men behind bars, and my reconstruction proves... proves it was others. Understand? Why is it so important to you? - Paolo, why is it important to you? Only the priests receive copies of 'Oservatore Romano' in this village... but there's no point trying to explain it to you two. Arch-priest Rosello would like to give it to you personally. Please come through. Please. Here. You need it for an article on Manzoni, eh? Yes. - Don't worry... return it when you want. Yes, you must forgive me if I've disturbed you... in these dark days. - My poor nephew... why didn't he go hunting alone on that day? He would still be with us now. This is an obscure crime. - Obscure? Mysterious. Why? They've already found the culprits... We must resign ourselves. What else can we do... but hope that poor pharmacist goes to hell for leading his double life. Do you really believe he should go to hell? In that case... good morning. Rosa... can you hear me? Professor Laurana is here. He wants to speak to you... he wants to help your father and your brothers. Open up. I don't want to. She's scared... if her brothers and her father get released, they'll kill her. They'll be released anyway... the important thing is that I speak to her. It's pointless - she won't talk. Let's go. On the day of the crime... the killings... where were they? They were here. - Here? Yes. But... ...who saw them? - Everyone saw them. Who is everyone? You must have seen them as well? No. I wasn't here. I wasn't here. Laurana, hi. You're here in Palermo. For my exams. - Did you see? Let's go away. We can't talk here. Chicago... it's like Chicago around here! But in my village, my dear honourable... they still kill in the traditional way. Did you hear about poor Roscio? Sure, I heard. You know, when I come here, it feels like I'm in Texas... or Dallas. Laurana, I can tell you... two weeks before he died, Roscio came to see me in Rome. In Rome? - Yes, in parliament. What did he want from you? Come, I'll tell you. CITIZENS, PROTECT YOUR GARDENS Our poor unfortunate friend met me in Rome. He asked me if I would accuse at the Chamber, in meetings and in the newspapers, a notable from your village One who has the province under his control, who wheels, steals and deals. A notable? Someone who controls the province? Who is it? - He said he had proof, then disappeared. Naturally, seeing he was already dead. And you? Didn't you connect the two incidents? I had my suspicions, but the investigation took a different path... erotica. But you know what I think? This mess stinks. I'm sure there are women involved somewhere. There was an air of blackmail, you know... it's as if Roscio wanted to get rid of someone with a scandal... protect a woman. In short, the usual petty bourgois custom we well know. Why don't we go to the police? - You and me, from the far left, go to the police? Great... then they'll immediately accuse me of political speculation. Do you always vote for the party? - Yes... but it keeps getting harder. Do you understand why? To the police, you say... We don't even know the name of the notable Roscio wanted me to report. Names can be discovered, if you want... If you knew how many reports end with a death threat... Okay, you're right. Look... - You're behind the times. Yes. It's you who goes forward. Is it true you're going to defend the servant's relatives? Yes, why? Nice gesture! Dear Paolo. It's true. However, I can guarantee you... that very soon the real culprits will be brought to justice. And who would those responsible be? Manno had many lovers. For once, it won't be the poor who have to pay. Good morning. Good morning, Professor. Rosello. - Hi, Paolo. Want some? - No, thanks. Listen. - Tell me. Did your cousin's husband have a lover? I'd exclude that. Yesterday morning, in Palermo... I received some information and, if it turns out to be true, it will change everything. Someone met your cousin, Roscio... a few days before he died. Everyone saw him. You, me, everyone. Yes, but not in Rome. Not in Palazzo Montecitorio... in parliament. - A politician? A politician. Then where does the woman fit in? This politician... got the impression that Roscio was trying to defend himself against a jealous husband. He collected proof against this person, he had documents... detailing all the serious crimes he'd committed against the State. Here. Forgive my curiosity, Paolino... but are you sure my cousin didn't name this politician? I'm very sure... but these documents he promised him must exist. Listen... why don't we go to Luisa's home? Your cousin. No, no. It's just not on. If these documents exist... they must be somewhere in the house. In a drawer, in the furniture... don't you think so? Okay, very well. However... you have to promise me you won't... In front of her... don't mention he was having an affair. Understood? So there was someone else. There was. Who do you think it was? I... This woman you're talking about; is her husband a powerful figure? I really don't know, Paolo. I'll find out, but... I think so. Come on. No, it seemed right to leave everything as he left it. I don't want to poke around his life, as if he were still alive. To find what? Proof of some wrongdoing? No, the politician hinted at a political matter. Luisa, we're just trying to remove a doubt... we want to respect his memory. - This isn't the way. Luisa... I'm mortified: It's all my fault. - That's not true. We're just doing our duty. No, that's for me. Leave it. Do you really believe this politician friend of yours' story... has something to do with my husband's death? Yes. - The anonymous letters... The anonymous letters he received... where do they fit in? I put it down to the killer's astuteness. The pharmacist was a false target... but it was him, your poor husband... ...that they wanted to kill. To silence him forever. I have to go. They're waiting for me. I'll come with you. - No, you keep on looking... it's a big house; it hides things. Call me if you find something. Yes. Let's keep looking. I'm sorry. Perhaps I shouldn't stay... No, we must look. Come. My daughter is asleep. This is his study. I haven't touched anything. He may have hidden the documents here. It's the only place. Does your daughter know? She doesn't know anything. We told her he went away. Seeing you dressed in black, doesn't she say anything? No, quite the opposite... she told me I look better like this. Luisa... excuse me, I'm tired. There's nothing here. He might have left them with your father-in-law. You're right, it's a possibility. I'm going to Palermo tomorrow for my exams... I could pay him a visit. My father-in-law? Sure. Yes... it's the only thing we can do. The entrance is there. Luisa... you came as well? Yes, it's better. I might be useful to you. He says he doesn't know anything. He's become suspicious - look at all the bells... he always wants to know where we are. The servant... me, the guests. He's in there. Aren't you coming? - No, go on. Come in. Come here, Paolo. What a pleasure. Thank you for coming to see me. Look at what I'm reduced to. For a famous optician, the Eternal Father has decreed the highest penalty: Absolute blindness. Drink something. Serve yourself. Tell me... my daughter-in-law tells me you... have some new suspects? Yes, we wanted to know... if you noticed your son behaving differently? Professor, you... did you notice anything different? You see, Paolo... my son was a very... complicated man. He was always in love. My daughter-in-law is very beautiful, isn't she? Yes. Or perhaps simply a lot of woman. When we were kids we used to call them... 'bed-worthy'. Come here, Paolo... let's go to the balcony. I don't feel safe talking here. Hear that? My daughter-in-law in the bedroom. What colour is Monte Pellegrino today? Purple. As always. My son, on the other hand, changed a lot. - Did he ever tell you his secrets? Paolo, some things are best left in the obscurity you find them in. I'm sorry, but are you thinking of something specific or not? There is something in my son's murder that makes me think of the living. It causes me pain... we must help them... the living. - Help the living? You mean the killers? If someone was responsible, you must look among the people closest to him. You could start with me, because... a father is always guilty. Always... responsible. No, for me a killer is a killer. They must be caught and punished, and that's it. It's a problem. Look in the drawer in my desk. Have a good look. There's a parcel. Yes, yes. This is the one. My son gave it to me... a week before he died. Take it. Do what you want with it. Take it. What do you think is inside? I don't know, and I hope I never find out. As you can see, I'm also one of the living, who need to be helped. Thank you, Professor. - Goodbye. Farewell. I haven't opened it. He still doesn't trust me, after all these years. Deep down, he's an unhappy old man. You must understand: Perhaps... he thinks these aren't women's things. - That's not true. That's not true, he hates me. He never wanted his son to marry me... the niece of a priest. Open it. It looks like a diary. - You read it. There are pages missing. - Let me see... Oh God, what has he written?! Paolo, I beg you: Don't read it. These are personal things. Shameful... Shameful. - Luisa. Forget about what you read. We shouldn't see each other anymore. Good morning. If you want a nice surprise, go to the palace of justice in Palermo tomorrow. After you, please. Paolino, you're here too? Yes, for a certificate. - Let me introduce you to the Honourable Apello. Don't be afraid. He might be useful to you. Allow me to introduce Professor Laurana. Politically speaking, he's a little distant from us... but he's an intelligent man. Culturally prepared. He's someone who should be helped. You know I'll do anything for my friends. - You hear that? Sometimes even for my intelligent enemies. Sorry, but the Judge is in a hurry. Goodbye. Good morning. What's wrong? - Nothing, Your Honour. Doctor, remember to speak to that person today, because my life could change completely. I'll do it. Are you free? - Where to? What area is this? - Kalsa. Wait a minute. Pull over, please. Shall I continue? Drive, drive. Who's making you do it? - Do what? Follow Ragan. - Who's Ragan? Ragan is Ragan. Excuse me, madam. I'd like to talk to your brother. It's not a good time. It's important. - He's eating. I must speak to him. Come in, Professor. You are always welcome. Good evening. Please. A modest dinner... Excuuse me. A notable... A notable who steals, runs rackets and lays down the law. Who do you think it is? - In the village? In the village, maybe the area. The entire province. No, what I mean is, if we limit it to the village the answer is easy, but if we look further afield it becomes confusing, dizzying. We'll limit ourselves to the village. Rosello. Advocate Rosello - he's the only notable in the village, the big shot. Then there are the smaller guys; some might include me amongst them. Rosello is a fool, but he's very astute. He would walk over corpses to get where he wants to be... except for the body of his uncle, the high-priest, naturally. So, Rosello is part of the board of directors of "Furiaris". 500,000 a month, and he gets two million annually as consultant to the society... three million as a member of "Siculedile". As a politician he's opened a new course... in league with the socialists and Communists from the province, and they are already giving him the wink. To the king! Yes, but apart from Rosello, who else in the province would fit the bill? We must exclude the members of parliament and the senators. Let's exclude them. Commander Fedeli... Doctor Jacobini, the lawyer Esposito... the lawyer Evangelisti... Pinuzzo, Professor Macomellir. - Professor Macomellir. Professor, how do you live? What do you do? How come you ignore everything in your village? The time of the poets with their heads in the clouds is over. It's true. Checkmate. It really is over. Good evening, Mr. Advocate. What did you think of Honourable Apello? I was more impressed with the guy with black glasses - who was he? He's a good guy, from Montalmo. Why do you want to know? Because he impressed me. He really is an impressive guy, yes. Is he from Montalmo? - Did I say he was from Montalmo? Yes. Strange because he's not from Montalmo, he's from Palermo... if he's really from Palermo... What's his name? I don't think I know. Isn't his name Ragan? I told you: I don't know his name. That's his name, Ragan. Paolo... it's him: It's my cousin Rosello. It's written here: At the beginning of April... he mentions someone... a thief; a profiteer who should be in prison. This person isn't named. - Isn't named? No, but it's obvious it's my cousin. I'd started to guess... but when he took on the defense of those unfortunate men... he had me fooled. I still can't believe it. Your cousin ordered the hit... and Ragan was the executor. Ragan, the delinquent of Palermo. I saw them together. This is not an accident, you know... someone alerted me. Who? Who? Someone who knows everything... and says things a bit at a time. A person who counts. I'm scared of my cousin. The way he makes himself at home, like he's the boss. I'm scared. Luisa... would you really be capable of going up against your cousin, Rosello? We must have proof. It won't be easy. I've been so stupid; I trusted him blindly. Then you told him everything? Not quite everything. Luisa, listen... we've got to do something. - But what? Take the diary for now. What are you doing? - Let go. Get in the car. We need to talk, Paolino. Whenever you want. - Yes, but not here. There's too much noise. We need a quiet place. The Palm hotel, tonight, around seven... there have been some developments. Try to be there. Your safety deposit box is number seven. - Thank you. You're welcome. The writer was inspired by a historical figure of the seventeenth century, Father Diego La Matina of Ragalbuto, who came from his hometown, to describe how this friar was condemned to the stake, for having asked for and wanted justice, and to he p us understand how these customs have been continuously recurring overthe centuries. Understood? - Yes, Professor... but I haven't studied it. - Bad! You can go. Mr. Dean, if you'll allow me, I'll resume this afternoon. Yes, yes, great work. - Thank you. Good morning. Good morning. Professor, a quick word... how did my daughter do in her history exam? Please leave me in peace. What did he say to you? He wants to see me tonight. You must not go. - Why? Did he say something to you? - No, not a word... all the way home, then he told me I should never leave the village. So you came here? I was scared... where did you put the diary? It's in a safety deposit box at the station. Here's the key. Let go, I'll keep it. I have to go now. Why don't we go to the police, Luisa? - No, not yet... he's strong; he can defend himself. Perhaps we should send an anonymous letter to the police? What? Sorry, I'm talking rubbish. Bye. I have to see other people here in Palermo, to get some information. Bye Where can I find you? - At my father-in-law's house. What's wrong with you? What happened? You know what's going on better than me. Do you want me to have a heart attack? What kind of trouble are you in? "Follow your own path if you don't want to end up in the cemetery." What have you done? You must go away now! Go to Rome. Away! Or stay at home for a few days. Do it for me. Is there a woman involved? Paolo. Leave me alone. - So there is a woman? Stop it. I want Palermo, 230468. It's Laurana... It's urgent. I'd like to call direct, if possible. Thank you. Hello? Roscio household? Ah, it's you, Luisa. No, the opposite... I think I did well to call you. I received an anonymous letter... a death threat. It was also made up of pieces from 'Oservatore Romano'. Me as well. What do you mean, you as well? What are we going to do? - We'll wait. No, I'll find him tonight, he has to know I have more information... and that it would be unwise to hurt us. - I'll be here tomorrow as well... keep me up to date. - Yes. Yes, I'll be in Palermo tomorrow morning. Goodbye, Luisa. Hello? Good evening. - Professor. According to you, what animal keeps its beak in the ground? I don't know. The widow. - Tell me something... war widows as well? - Sure. I won't let you. Why are you laughing, idiot? - It's a difficult alliance, complicated... Paolino... what are you doing here? Two hours... two hours, blessed son! You kept me waiting like a fool. The Judge was here too. Why? I have some good news for you. The father and the brothers of the... The father and the brothers of the servant have an alibi. I discovered it. They'll be released tomorrow morning. I went to their farm. I found the witnesses and persuaded them to talk, one by one. In short, I succeeded where you failed. You're smart. We must celebrate tonight, Paolino. Do you want to come with me? Will you really come with me? Where? There are two of them, just outside the village. Two what? Two single girls... they drive an Alfa 2000 with Florence license plates... I'll get the car ready. Make sure they don't notice you, otherwise they'll follow us. Listen... are you scared? Good, Paolo. That's how friends are made. My car is outside, on the corner. Good evening. - Good evening. Get in. Come on, get in. I received this letter this evening. It's a death threat. - Close your door. Close it. I inherited a habit from your poor cousin Roscio... That's nice. I keep a diary. Up-to-the-minute... I keep this diary locked away in my office at the college... in Palermo. They were here. I don't see them anymore... They'll be in that car there. - No, it was a white Alfa. Go home. Go back to your mother... and leave Luisa alone, understood? I'm spending the night with a woman. I know who you're going to see... Luisa Roscio. Her husband's only been dead two months, and she already needs... I'm going to see the high-priest tomorrow morning... To your uncle. - Please, listen... don't do anything rash. I must go to Palermo... tomorrow you'll know why, but let me go now. Bye. Professor, I've never taken you to Palermo. Don't worry... I won't say a word. - Thanks. The hotel is there. - Thanks. You don't even need ID. Salvatore, do you want some melons? - No, thank you. Okay, goodbye, and not a word. I'll take care of it. Is there a telephone? - No. Thanks. Can I make a call, please? Come in, it's on the right. Thank you. Hello? Is commissioner Baldi there? This is Professor Laurana, it's something urgent. Ah, it's you. I need to talk to you immediately. No, I can't talk on the phone. It's too early. I know, I'm sorry. Okay, okay. At midday. I'll pass by the station, okay. It's something urgent. Bye. Hello, Luisa. There have been some developments. Shall we meet? - Okay, where? At Villa Bonanno? Yes, right away. Where did you sleep? I slept in a hotel here in Palermo. - Why? Yesterday evening, your cousin... he frightened me. - How? They wanted to take me away in a car, but I was smarter than them. I told him I kept a diary detailing everything I did, day-by-day. It's not true. Understand? It's not true. I made an appointment to see a friend of mine in the police this morning. When? Midday. Let's give this some thought... Are you having doubts right now? You're accusing my cousin of killing my husband. Either way, my family would be ruined by the scandal. What if they don't arrest him? He has powerful friends. I know him. He'd seek revenge. Let's stop here for a while, and pretend nothing's happened... and that no one's after us. What's going on between you and your cousin? Why? What have they told you? - The others, nothing. Forgive me, but it almost feels like... there's almost an understanding between you two. I was his lover. Are you still? No. Was this before or after you married Roscio? Before. We fell in love when we were kids... but cousins can't marry, unless they get permission from the church. My uncle, the high-priest, didn't allow it. Roscio... I never loved him. Served and respected, yes. But I never loved him. He only ever thought of me as a body. What's wrong? Do you feel ill? No, I can't tell you everything. I can't! I feel sick. Luisa... No. Why not? Get in. Give me the key to the safety deposit box. Nothing to tell me? I began to understand a few days before she stopped mourning. I knew straight away, because Roscio's servant is the mother of my aunt's servant. Look who's here. Good morning. They really created a masterpiece. What a pleasure it is to see you again, Your Honour. Good morning, Your Excellency. They created a real masterpiece. I'm going to explode if I don't talk to someone. Who do you want to talk about? - The person you were talking about earlier. Who were we talking about? - Poor Laurana. What about poor Laurana? - Poor innocent, he didn't know a thing. Bite my finger. Bite it... You're like Swedes, but we're in Sicily, Italy. I heard something that must remain between us regarding Laurana... He was an idiot.
