Well I think this one's working a little too well. Well at least it's working. Annie's not going to be happy. So... How is Annie? She's pregnant. Congratulations. You're not exactly jumping for joy, are you? I mean it's... It's not that. Ha. Look at me. I'm not exactly fatherhood material. I don't know the first thing about raising a kid. Hell... I felt the same way about the first one. It's... um... It's a big step in a man's life. You know... Once upon a time I swore I would never be like my old man. Now... here I am... Giving the same advice he gave me. Packet of Smokes... Blues. Excuse me; Can you not see we're in the middle of a conversation here? Oh I'm sorry. I thought this place was a store. Steven? Steven Ray? - Yeah? - We should meet. So how did you find me? Do you believe in fate Steven? I mean me, myself; I never really used to think about it. But I'm coming round to it. - Right... - Look the re-the reason I bring it up is because... I believe the two of us were meant to meet. That this conversation we are having right now was meant to happen. Doesn't matter what happened yesterday. We'd still be sitting talking to each other right now. What's that? Some sort of Sigmund Freud shit? It's Elisabeth Kubler-Ross... Actually. I don't know who the fuck that is. Is that why you called me here? Well, did you want to tell me why you need someone of my particular skill set? Well where do you want to start? Say I was to shoot you, right here, right now? Right now? No, it wouldn't work. It's against the rules. - Rules? - It has to happen when I least expect it. Okay, if I was to shoot you... Right here and now... without warning... Would you expect it? It's a good point but... still it wouldn't work. For it to work... I need to not want to die. Right now I want to die. If I didn't I wouldn't be here talking to you. So you've... paid someone to shoot you before? I provoked a situation that led to it, and... it obviously ended with mixed results. Right. Why don't you just do it yourself? What is it about my face that makes you think I haven't already tried that? Look, I have gone through an extensive series of elimination and... Look I've come up with this theory. - A theory? - Yes. Really? And your last attempt that was jumping off the building? Uh, sort of. It wasn't exactly the plan. Why didn't you think of that sooner? I was scared of heights. Vertigo I think they call it. Makes me dizzy. You sure you want to go through with this? This is your chance... If you're not... people kill themselves all the time... usually when they fail... at suicide it's because they didn't actually want to kill themselves at all. Usually... It's for attention. Desperate cry for help. This is much more complicated. Is it? If you're fucking with me... playing games... me killing you... that's going to be the last thing you have to fucking worry about. Look... if I tell you, you have to promise to not think it's stupid. I already think it's stupid. I jumped off the Humber Bridge in London last year. Over two hundred people have successfully committed suicide. Now I'm one of five to survive. This... self-inflicted gun wound... look... pfff... You get the picture. I'm like Cain... There's something else happening here that's out of my control. You telling me you can't die? It's a curse. Pfff. Is that it? When exactly am I supposed to do this? You have to do it when I don't want to die. How the fuck am I supposed to know when that is? Look, I'm paying you a lot of money Steven. Be creative. It's a pleasure doing business with you Mr. Wells. Percival... call me Percival. How are we doing tonight? Coffee... Black. - What? - Independent jobs I see. Freelancing again. I needed the money. You get my consent first before you do anything Steven. Anything! It's easy money. It's not like I'm making any fucking money working for you. We're not exactly working for free Steven. Frank Dubios. Is he dead or not? Something happened. There was an incident. That'll be $12.95 sir. Across the street. Mind getting out here? Yeah I do fucking mind if I get out here. Across the street. Yeah, you can walk across the street. No, across the street. Far left corner. Look... just pay me and get out. - You free? Yeah I just need him to pay. Alright? I'll pay you when you take me across the street. Sir, you're being very difficult. Fuck! Fainted? It's a seizure. Still struggling with the street crossing thing I see. And as for our old pal? Frank? Well that's to be continued. You're awake. How do you feel? You were shot three times. On the train. You remember? Turns out being shot could have been a blessing in disguise. While we were removing one of the bullets, We found a golf-ball sized tumor... dangerously close to your spinal column. We were able to remove the tumor without complications. Now it wasn't cancerous... But if it had grown much larger... you could have ended up spending the rest of your life in a wheelchair. Or even be dead. Everything else appears to be tip top. None of your wounds is life threatening. No significant damage to any internal organs, no artery damage. We were only able to remove one of the bullets though. So you might have a bit of trouble getting through airport security. Three bullets. You're very lucky to be alive. Although I appreciate the effort... I did tell you the conditions. You still don't believe me? I'll give you credit where credits due. Certainly an ambitious little theory you got going but... It's still ridiculous. It's not possible. You saw me land on your cab. Right? Remember those three bullets you put in my chest? People fall of buildings. People get shot, I have heard of more fantastic tales of survival than that. It's a curse. I know it is. Okay... Let's say for a moment that it is a curse. - It is. - It's not... but let's fucking say that it is. How do we break it? I don't know. Oh Come on... Come on it's clear you've got a very vivid imagination. You seem to know everything about everything else. But you got nothing for that? Tell me what do I have to do? Okay, a werewolf... A werewolf will die with a silver bullet. Vampire's weakness... garlic! Superman... Kryptoni- It's not a comic book. Look, I'm just trying to level with you here. No, I'm trying to understand where the fuck it is that you're coming from. Because from my point of view, your point of view is a little fucking Norma Desmond. I know it's crazy but... Look there's... there's no other explanation for it. There doesn't need to be an explanation, shit happens, Get that through your fucking head. There's no such thing as fate, there's no such thing as Karma. There's certainly no fucking such thing... as a curse. Look I don't know how else to prove it to you. I thought everything that happened would speak for itself. Enough! Enough playtime. Okay? We're both adults here. The fact of the matter is that I fucked up. We were on a public train and I rushed it. I wasn't precise with my shots. I'm usually more thorough. And how many times have you done this before? So ah... for this to work... you need to be happy when I do it? Not quite I need to be in... um... an overall state of mind. Where I truly and honestly want to live. But you said you don't want to live. You don't want to live, right? That's a problem. Well that makes it next to impossible. I didn't say it was going to be easy. That's why I paid you as much as I did. Look... try and get to know me. Figure out what makes me tick. My likes, Dislikes... Try and figure out something I do take joy out of. This isn't the fucking make a wish foundation. I kill people. You asked for a suggestion. You're no different to any of the others you know. Bullet through your fucking brain does exactly the same thing to you as it does to everybody else. Let's just hope so. I'll see you when I see you. So how do you feel? You're lucky to be alive. Where to? There. It's across the road. So what's with this place. Couldn't you pick some place quiet? Look I've been in isolation for the better part of a month. Eating nothing but hospital food and... watching daytime television, excuse me for wanting to get out of the house. Does it hurt? What, this hole in my face where my eyeball used to be? You know every time you try and kill yourself? You don't want to know. If you hadn't turned around I would have got you right in the back of the head. You bagged and tagged in the morgue right now probably. Oh probably... Someone's starting to believe. Hell of a coincidence, I'll give you that. It's no coincidence. All this has happened for a reason. Maybe I'm just not the guy for the job. I don't know. I haven't been myself lately. Out of all the hundreds of cabs in this town... I landed on yours. You'll get the job done. Thanks. Ice-cream. Yeah, why? What's wrong with ice-cream? I got a sweet tooth. Mmm good. So tell me. Why do you want to kill yourself so badly? Mummy and Daddy, they didn't love you enough? No it had nothing to do with anything like that. It has everything to do with anything like that. How do you expect me to help you if you don't give me all the necessary information? I mean... you told me I had to kill you when you least expected it. Tried that, didn't work. Obviously. Let's get creative here. No I don't want to think about it. When was the last time you were happy? - Happy? - Yeah. You know the most recent point in time where... You didn't feel like a suicidal maniac. I don't want to think about it, it gets me depressed. It's a little late for that don't you think? Lovelorn? I'm getting warm huh? That's it. Lost loved one? Well done Steven. What, were you a psychiatrist before you went into the business of killing people? You should have you own... talk show. I don't have the personality for it. Good, you've done your homework. At least my money's not going to waste. What was her name? Come on, what was her name? Chris. It's a nice name. I like that name. Sounds hot. What was she like? Oh! Give me something, what did she look like? Humph! Ah... 6 foot... Dimples... and a HUGE cock. Did you say a huge cock? Yeah. Oh it was a she-male? Hah No, not a she-male. He was a man. You're a fag? I'm gay. And... you fuck guys. Jesus! I mean you know it's ah... It's... yeah... good for you. As long as you think... It's alright... and you're happy... and the other person's... Look maybe I'll stop you there. Okay. So, what happened? You want me to kill you or not, what happened? He was murdered. You did it? No, uh... I'm not like you. No... You're not like me. Certainly not like me. That's it. I got it. - I've got an idea. - Ooh! An idea. Come on, don't keep me waiting... I'm on the edge of my seat. Okay, but before I say anything. I just want to remind you that I think all this is a crock of shit. Clear? Crystal. Good. You ever thought about dating again? Well I am human... I do appreciate companionship. But... dating... It just takes so long to build up a relationship. Quite frankly I don't want to live that long. I'm not talking about a fucking relationship. It's not like "dating" dating. I'm talking about fucking. Steven, look at me. I look like a pirate. Who wants to... do anything with me sexually. This is the valley. I'm sure there is... fags like you everywhere. Maybe even in this bar. - Hah. - What? What did I say? What can I get you? I'll get a draft please. And whatever he wants. Dirty martini. Extra dirty. Thanks for the drink. Don't mention it. What's your name? - Kim. - Kim... I've got this friend who is really dying to meet you. Really? Where is he? He's a great guy. He's a little bit bashful. Name's Percival. Yeah, not really my type. But you're gay? Yeah, so? You've got a cock? Excuse me? You've got a cock. What else do you need? Look... He really needs to get laid. Are you fucking kidding me? I know he's not much to look at. Who the hell do you think you are? I'll pay you. You're sick in the head. $300 $500 if you seal the deal. Oh my God. I paid you to kill me, not innocent people. I don't leave witnesses. Where is he? I buried him. Hah. He was a good person. You didn't even fucking know him. He didn't deserve to die. What am I supposed to do? I'm a professional, no loose ends. You shot him point blank in the face. All you did to me was smother me with a pillow. Yeah well I felt bad about taking your eye out. Okay? Didn't want to disfigure you more than I already have. He's a good man. Saw past my face and he liked me... for who I was. Made me feel like I was somebody. Yeah well, that's what he was paid to do. Excuse me? I paid him to have sex with you. - Oh, come on. Really, you going to cry? Well I'm going home, call me when you're done. This isn't a fucking game Steven. My name's Steven. Nice to meet you Steven. Not going to tell me your name? You didn't ask. It's Jessica. I see you round here a bit. Always alone. So what do you do? I kill people. Hah, is there much money in that? You any good at your job? Not lately. Haven't been laid in a while. Promise to be good at it? Wow... ah... I do have to ask... About the um... eye-patch. What about it? Is it for fashion or... It was an accident. Oh what happened? I tripped, fell and lost an eye. Shit! Must have been one nasty spill. Yeah. I suppose it was. I'm sorry I don't mean to stare. Sorry, it's just um... that I'm still getting used to it. I never really saw myself as an eye-patch kind of a guy. That's fine, you... you look good. This one, sir... is on me. Thanks. It's Brad, right? Yeah. You... you from around here? Come on. Fuck me. Fuck me harder. Come on. Stop. You stop. Stop. Oh. Oh! Stop. Please... Stop. What the fuck? Get the fuck off me! What did I do? You tried to fucking strangle me. - What? - Fucker! I'm sorry. What the fuck is... Fuck off! I'm sorry. I thought you enjoyed it! HEY! I want you to take off your pants and close your eyes. Brad? What are you doing? What the fuck do you think... You think this kind of lifestyle is appropriate? You faggots, you fucking make me sick. You may know who we are... we know who you are. And if you even think about getting the law involved, mate. You'll be begging for us to kill you. This is what happens when you go around sucking dicks, mate. Think of it as... What's that? Wait, the queer's got something to say. Come on, speak up so we can all hear. All you faggots... can suck my dick. Hello? I've locked myself out. Could you open up for me please? Who... who is it? Apartment 10 Frank Dubois. INSIDE APARTMENT (MALE Hello? Who is it? Do you have any idea what time it is? INSIDE APARTMENT Daddy? You hear that? I can hear you thinking. Something's the matter. I can't do this anymore. Do what? You fucking know what. You been killing people your whole life, kid... and all of a sudden you can't? Why is Frank Dubois still alive? Something's... Something's happening to me, mate. I feel... I feel different. No my boy... I can see right through you. I know you better than you know yourself. Lying to me is counterproductive. You don't feel anything. This is different. No it's not. It's different. I can feel things I haven't felt in a long time. Like what? I don't think I can do this anymore. Kill the queer... and move on. Why do you hurt people? I don't know. You just... You do it for the sake of it? I'll never understand it. Why people can do such... ugly things to one another. Why is there so much... hate and anger in the world? You remember being born? First words? First steps? Of course not, nobody does. My earliest memory. Is of my father. Throwing me head first through a plate glass coffee table. Fifty stitches. Closest thing to affection anybody had ever shown me. Till Annie... came along. Your wife? Where is she? Is that why you do it? Goes back to that. That first memory, you know. It wasn't what... It wasn't what happened. It's what I was thinking at the time. I envisioned myself picking up... One of those pieces of glass. And slicing his throat with it. Watching him bleed to death. Couldn't have been more than... Four, five years old at the time. And that's what was running through my head. This is the kind of thoughts... kids just have. Not like that. So where did it all start. I don't know, I can't remember being born. Can't remember my first... words, first steps. I can't remember when all this... began but... it's like it was always there. I'm no better than the guys that did this to you. Five on one. Just doesn't seem fair. You from around here? Just visiting. Oh yeah, vacation? Business trip. Business trip. Oh yeah, what do you do? I'm a salesman. Life insurance. Ah Yeah. You in town for long? No, I leave in the morning. Oh that's too bad. Hm... staying at the Grand Royal. That's a good hotel. Yeah. Ah, business must be good then. So so. Been a bit slow lately. Ah, that's a bummer. I have a feeling it's going to... pick up real soon. This one's on me. What time you get off? You want to turn the light on? I like the dark. What's with all the newspaper? You got a dog or something? Whoa! What are you doing? Shut your fucking mouth or your head is next. Okay? Fuck! Shit! Fuck! I want you to call... The three gentlemen you had come round and rough up my friend the other night. I don't - I don't know what you're talking about. You don't fucking know what I'm talking about? Holy shit. I'll give you ten seconds, Brad. Before I call every single contact... in your phone... and I kill them. Ten seconds, Brad. Call them. I did, they - they're on their way. Oh shit. So that's how it works huh? - How long till they get here? - I don't - Speak of the devil. - What are you doing on the floor? - That's not right. Whur! Huur! Oh fuck. Please... please... Pull your pants down. What? Don't fucking make me ask you twice. Okay. Everything! Please... Don't make me do this. I'm not making you do anything. What? Fuck! No! Oh fuck! OH FUCK! Come on, it's not that bad. Shit! Look at that. I think I missed a spot. SHIT! OH FUCK! Oh fuck. Oh fuck. Oh fuck. Why is it that you hate gays so much? Huh? You a religious man? Brad? Fanatic? Get a little too much attention? From your uncle? Maybe it's just me... I don't know. Maybe I'm just incapable of understanding. You see, I don't give a fuck... If you're gay, straight, black, white... Fucking purple... I kill everybody. Please! Please just fucking kill me! No, it's too easy. I'm going to give you some time to think about this Brad. In case you get any bright ideas. About retribution... or speaking to someone about what's gone on here tonight. I will come back to finish what I started. Cheer up Brad. It's a good day for you. You're lucky to be alive. Fuck. Just kidding. So... ah, this is your place? You did all these? I did. So that's what you do? You're like an artist? I try to be. Make money from these? Here and there. I have my work in galleries sometimes and if someone likes them, maybe they'll buy them. Something new? Work in progress. That's a face. Thanks, that's what it's supposed to be. You got a name for it? Christopher. Right. Ahem. Don't worry. I didn't kill everybody. What did you do to them? Let's just say... He's a changed man. What? You gave me his address. Yeah, so? So! What did you think was going to happen? Hah. Tell me something. Be honest. Somewhere deep down in your mind... You wanted me to kill him, right? Didn't you? You want to crack a window or something, it's er... These paint fumes are making me nauseous. Yeah, I need some fresh air too. Why did you do it? Who knows why I do half the things I do, good or bad? You're welcome. Once upon a time. I used to be afraid of heights. Not anymore? Used to get vertigo. First time I jumped off a building... I was scared out of my mind, I almost didn't do it. Maybe... Maybe it wasn't the height you were afraid of. Maybe it was a part of you that was afraid to die. I wanted to die that how I overcame my fear. Look... If I were you... I wouldn't think of this thing as a curse. Well think about it it's like you're invincible. You can pretty much do anything you want without consequence. You're not afraid to die. What are you afraid of? Clowns. Clowns? Yeah, ever since I was a kid. That's not what I meant. I meant... There's got to be a reason. Why you want to die so badly? No don't get me wrong, I understand what it's like to lose somebody, believe me I do. But there's something you're no telling me. There's something more to this. I loved Christopher. He was taken away from me. Yeah? But unless you pulled the plug on him I don't understand why you feel so fucking guilty about it. Who said anything about guilt? I saw your painting. That had nothing to do with Christopher. Fine. You want my advice? You want to break this curse? You have to face what you are really afraid of. What are you really afraid of? I see you have a history of seizures. Diagnosed as an epileptic three years ago. Been taking your medication? Hmm... If you care to live a longer life... I'd follow through on this one. Former patient of mine had a seizure a few weeks back. On her ninth floor balcony. Splat! Right in front of a bunch of school kids. All because she wasn't taking her medication. Yeah well um... I'm cloudy enough without the pills. Do you have any idea how lucky you are? You were this close to being road kill. Nine times out of a ten, A vehicle like that is going to crush your head like a watermelon. I guess I got lucky. Must be here for a reason. Hey! What's wrong? What, you're not allowed to cross the road? I can cross the street, why? Well come over here. We'll go to this cafe. No, I been to that place before. Yeah and? I didn't like it. So what? It's a coffee shop. I fucking hate coffee. Ah... yeah okay fine, well where then? Look like a couple of pedophiles in the place. I'm a gay man with an eye-patch. You think I care what people think? But you're right, it's an odd place for lunch. Why? It's pizza. There's a perfectly good pizzeria across the street. Whatever. Fuck off, I'm eating. Now this is what kids do for fun, huh? This game's bullshit. Well how can you not like whack-a-croc. I don't even know what the fuck whack-a-croc is. You have never played whack-a-croc? Stop saying whack-a-croc. Now this... This is more fucking like it. No I think this sends the wrong message to kids. What like a message from God or something? You're the one always talking about... God and astrology. Fate, all that other crap. I tend to think my belief in God is at its strongest when I need someone to blame. Why do you think Christopher died? Excuse me? I mean he's dead. You think that happened for a reason? Maybe once I figure that out... I can die in piece. Something to drink? Just water, no ice. This Annie? What's that? Is this Annie? Yeah. Cool! This an antique? Yeah, yeah, you're like a bull in a china shop. Take it easy. You listen to opera music? Yeah I do. Listen I've got this um book. I really want you to check out. Which book? - You read Voltaire much? - I've heard of him. Now well... It's called Candide... Classic Voltaire. Highly regarded as one of his greatest works. What's it about? Fate. That things happen and no matter what you do... you can't change it. And all that theoretical science bullshit, you know. I think you'd enjoy it. Have you got an aspirin? Why, you got a headache? A... everything ache. Yeah. In the bathroom. Medicine cabinet. Geez Steven... You've got enough prescription drugs in here for a mass suicide. - Well, feel free. Already tried it. Didn't work. God, I put this book in here somewhere. Have you ever tried to kill yourself before? What? You know, even thought of it? No, can't say I have. Not even a little bit? No not even a little bit. Why? I don't know Percival, I just haven't. Hypothetically speaking... say you believed in fate. That everything has a purpose, that everything happens for a reason. Where the fuck is this book? Why do you think Annie died? It was here two fucking days ago, I swear to God. Why are you still here? What's your purpose? What is this? Twenty fucking questions? I'm just curious. I'm trying to find this fucking book and you're distracting me. - Okay? - Okay. Sorry. Ah, got it. Found it. Percival! Percival? What the fuck? Fucking pig. Where the fuck are you going? Please. I've got a wife; She just had a baby girl. Please, don't do it. So Officer Green's doing okay? He's in a stable condition, nothing life threatening. He's a good man. Just had a little girl a few weeks back. You have children Mr. Ray? No. Well he's very grateful for what you did for him tonight. Putting yourself in harm's way to save him life. Bullet smashed through my window. I saw the gunfire outside. Yeah... It's funny how life works, hey? And that bullet misses your window. Who knows? Little girl has to grow up without a father. Is that lipstick? Look... I'm not here to judge a man's lifestyle... You saved one of our own... We'll forever be in your debt. You're a hero. Something happened tonight man. It's hard to explain. Fate I guess... I don't know. But I had some kind of ah... Breakthrough... ha ha. I saved a man's life Percival. A policeman. At first I thought it was all one big coincidence, you know. Then I thought about what you said. The more I thought about it... the more I think it happened for a reason. Why? I don't know. But I've never felt like this before in my life about anything. I mean I don't know what my purpose is. Not yet anyway. But tonight I served a purpose, tonight... I did something purposeful. Can't explain it. I don't know it was all these different elements... Involved. When they came together, all these pieces... It was perfect. It was like it was always meant to be. I don't... I don't know. I don't know why... Annie died, I don't... can't tell you why Christopher was killed. But for the first time in my life. Percival. My actions... My actions had a reason. A real reason. I don't know why you're still alive. I don't know what your purpose is Percival. I mean that's something that you're going to have to figure out for yourself. But I do know that... None of this... none of it could have happened if it wasn't for you. For that I thank you. And the deal's off... You hear me? The deal's off. Money's yours. Besides... The world's better with you in it. What the fuck is he doing? Percival! Hey! Percival. What the fuck is the matter with you? Huh? Jesus! Holy shit... Holy fucking shit. What are you doing? Huh? You honestly thought that was going to work? Jumping in front of fucking traffic, really? Shit. Come on. Christopher was taken away from me. I know. I know. Come on get up. Where did you get this from? It was cold. It rained that night. The roads were wet. I was right Steven. Fate brought us together. All this happened for a reason. Where the fuck did you get this from? Percival don't fucking tell me it was you. Christopher was taken away from me. I was at a bar. About that time mate. Come on pack it up, come back tomorrow. - You told me to confront my guilt. - SHUT THE FUCK UP! Out of all the millions of people and cabs in this town, I landed on yours. All of this was meant to happen. This is how it's supposed to end. Go ahead I deserve it. Go on. It's supposed to finish like this. Fuck! Oi! Freeze! Put down the weapon. Fuck. Fuck. He had a gun pointed at your face. Now if there was anyone who should be able to give us an accurate... detailed description of the gunman it would be you. And yet... You don't recall. Perhaps you don't realize how lucky you are to be alive right now. Can I help you? - What's this? - Read it. I don't understand. That's your license plate number Frank. How do you have this? Because I know everything there is to know about you Frank. Who are you? How do you know my name? I've killed a lot of people Frank. Excuse me? I killed people even before Annie died. After she passed, I just... I don't know, I started to think like... Maybe I was doing it for a reason. I saw... the license plate number on the car Frank. I saw. Clear as fucking day. I saw it. But when I woke up I just, I couldn't remember it. A few letters and numbers stood out but... I just couldn't put it together. Check please. I thought I had it remembered. It was there, it was there! I just... I couldn't reach it. I don't know what you're talking about but you're starting to give me the creeps, okay. So I hit my head. And it was hard for me to remember. Hey, who is this guy? So I just... I killed anyone who's... number-plate that came even remotely close... to what I had in my head. Hey pal... I think you've had enough, yeah. What? It's time for you to go. Listen... Time to die. Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Can you not fucking see that I am in the middle of something important. Yeah. Good. Thank you. Then your number-plate... came up Frank. Your number came up. And I thought for the longest time. I thought you were the one. Look fellow... I think you got the wrong person here. I nearly killed you Frank. I nearly fucking killed you. But you got lucky... You got real lucky. Luckier that the rest anyway. Why do you think that was? We, I-I-I don't know. Do you think it was fate that saved you? I mean if I put two bullets... right between your eyes right now as we speak. That would pretty much trump the idea of fate now wouldn't it? Or would that just be what was meant to be all along. Is it fate? Or is it because of my free will you continue to be alive? And I don't know... I don't fucking know. Be thankful... Frank. Be thankful. Hello Steven. I can't do it. You have to. But, before you do. I need you to forgive me first. Please. Please Steven forgive me for... I'm sorry. Me to. Forgive me. I can't do that. Please, not yet. So how did you know Percival? He was, um... We were friends. I'm Todd. Percival's brother. Steven. Yeah. You... ah... you guys close? Yeah. Yeah, we were. He... ah... kept most people at a distance. Even me... Especially after Christopher died. Look... um... As you know, Percival was quite the artist. Yeah, I saw. Some of his work. He was... Very talented. Yeah. Look he... ah... One of his favorite galleries is putting on a... exhibition of his work. As a memorial. I think he'd like it if you could come. Yeah. Thank you. Thank you. I don't believe you. I don't give a fuck what you believe or not. Because I'm done. You're a killer. You always were. There's no sense in trying to change it. Because that's what you are. This conversation's over. For now, Steven. For now. He... ah... He painted this not long after Christopher passed. Steven, right? Yup. You're... um... Todd. Percival's brother. Yeah. It's good to see you. Glad you could make it. You know I... ah... I always admired his talent you know, even as a kid. He was always painting and drawing. Just... Not so sure I'm fond of his recent work. It's beautiful. Yeah... yeah I suppose. It's just so dark. Depressing. Heartbreaking actually. To have someone you hold so dear be so... sad. Just... I just hope he found some sort of closure before he left this world, you know? This... ah, is some of his earlier stuff. You can see the difference. This is how I prefer to remember him. I remember him... working on this one. Yeah this... ah... This was the last thing he did. Christopher. Yeah. Yeah he painted this totally from memory. No photos, no pictures, nothing. It's amazing isn't it? Yeah I knew Christopher quite well and ah... No this... this really captures his essence. Excuse me can you not see we are in the middle of a conversation here? Oh I'm sorry I thought this place was a store. Did you... ah... ever meet Christopher? Steven. Steven. Steven. You are very lucky to be alive.
