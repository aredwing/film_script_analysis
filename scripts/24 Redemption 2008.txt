We are just leaving the township now, sir. - How many do you have? - Five. Only five? By the time we got to the field, most of the boys were gone. I need soldiers, not excuses. I will bring some more, sir, I promise. Just bring them to me. Youssou, take this. [ Machine Gun Fire Continues ] [ Dubaku ] You will learn to fight like men. Of that I have no doubt. This... will make you strong little soldiers. This will make you free. Come. Take it. Ah. How does it make you feel? Powerful, yes? Come. Your mothers and your fathers, they have made you weak. But General Juma, he will make you strong! He will make you strong so that you can take back the country... from the governments and the traitors that work for them! - Like this cockroach, here! - [ Whimpering ] Down. [ Whimpering ] This cockroach works for the government and their white masters. - Yes. Yes. - [ Man Weeping ] No, no. Have mercy on me. They have taken our land. No. But soon all that will change. Soon all the land will belong to the people again. So... we must buy our freedom... with the blood of this cockroach. [ Whimpering ] No. He's only a cockroach, and you know what we do to cockroaches. Chop up the cockroach. Kill the cockroach. [ Chanting ] Kill the cockroach! Kill the cockroach! Kill the cockroach! Kill the cockroach! Kill the cockroach! Kill the cockroach! Kill the cockroach! Kill the cockroach! Kill the cockroach! Kill the cockroach! Kill the cockroach! Kill the cockroach! Kill the cockroach! Kill the cockroach! Kill the cockroach! Kill the cockroach! Kill the cockroach! Kill the cockroach! Kill the cockroach! Kill the cockroach! Kill the cockroach! Kill the cockroach! Kill the cockroach! Kill the cockroach! Kill the cockroach! [ Screams ] [ Jack Bauer ] The following takes place between 3:00 p.m. and 5:00 p.m. Events occur in real time. - I thought I told you to turn up the air-conditioner. - All right, sir. I do so. [ Lowing ] - For crying out loud. - [ Horn Honking ] - [ Lowing ] - Go on! Go around them! Go on. But we need another player. Find somebody else. Who? Tell me, Willie-- Who can handle the ball better than you? That's right. No one. We're not supposed to go to town without Mr. Benton. Mr. Benton worries too much, and so do you. Hey, Desmond! Hurry, or the bus will leave. Come on. Let's go. You're not my father. I'm your brother, and you'll do what I say. - No! - Fine then. The truck is here! The truck is here! Hey! The truck is here! [ Speaking Native Language ] The truck is here! [ Cheering ] [ Children Chattering ] I wasn't stealing it. I swear. I was just looking. Forgot these. Very pretty. For a woman, yes? I was gonna give it to my daughter one day. You have a daughter? Yeah. Where did you get it? Rajasthan. India. You ask a lot of questions. That's what Mr. Benton says. I bet. When were you there? - Last summer. - Before you came here? Yes. And before that, where were you? - Different places. - When are you going home? I'm not going home. Listen, I told the other boys I'd help them unload the truck. - If you want that, you can keep it. - Really? Really. Willie. You're gonna have to give me my knife back though. Go on. Hey, Willie. The supply truck's here. - The boys could use some help. - Look what Jack gave me. Very nice. It's from India. Jack, this is Frank Tramell. He's the ambassador's chief political officer. I know who he is. He says he left some messages for you to come see him at the embassy. I got his messages. What's going on, Jack? I'll tell you what's going on. The senate subcommittee has questions... about the illegal detention and torture of certain prisoners in Mr. Bauer's custody. I have a subpoena requesting you to appear, and it's way past due. So consider yourself served. [ Panting ] I told the boys I'd help them unload the truck. Excuse me. Failure to comply to a subpoena is a federal offense, Mr. Bauer. You are bound by law to respond. Then give them my response. They want me back in Washington, they can come and get me. The, uh, ambassador said... that you and Bauer were in the special forces together? - How long has he been here? - A few months. He never mentioned the subpoena? Nope. Well, he's been ducking it for more than a year, across three different continents. Washington is leaning on the ambassador to deliver him. And now the ambassador's leaning on you. Bauer doesn't come back to the States on his own, they'll come for him. That would be a mistake. You're doing God's work here, Carl. Between malaria and the wars, these kids never had a chance. Now you're giving them a decent life. It'd be a shame if the funding dried up. Don't threaten me, Frank. I'm just giving you the facts. You're his friend. Talk some damn sense into him. Here, Jack. Thank you, Thomas. Okay. Go back. Now you. Go, go. There he is. The mighty warrior who traded his gun for a wheelbarrow. Why are you here, hmm? To do penance for all your sins? You don't want to talk about it. I don't blame you. - Watch out. - The man from the embassy-- What did he want? Nothing. He just wanted to talk. Talk about what? Willie, you ask too many damn questions. [ Man ] Let's go. Here's the oranges. Willie? Come here. I need your help. Thank you. Come with me. [ Thomas ] Jimmy. Take a box. Here. Careful. Don't drop it. [ Men Shouting ] The government won't be able to hold out against us for long. Except we have more weapons than soldiers who can use them. We need to overrun the main garrison from the west. We have minefields here and here. Then I'll bring you more little soldiers to clear them. Do not worry. Our father would be really proud, Youssou. Very proud. You will have your little soldiers. Go. [ Ringing ] [ Ringing, Beeps ] This is Colonel Dubaku. Hodges here. I've just heard some troubling news, Colonel, that your recruiting numbers are-- are still coming up a little short. I want you to know my offer stands. I've got personnel standing by right across the border. They can be deployed within the hour. That won't be necessary. Oh? Do some thinking now, Colonel. I'm offering you professional soldiers, not children you haven't had time to train. You provided the weapons. We will fight our own war. Well, it's your country. It will be, soon. Is there anything else, Mr. Hodges? Yeah. Uh, tell General Juma... give me a call when he gets there, will you? I'll let him know. Good. [ Beeps ] That's one hard-nosed son of a bitch. It is his country. But I'm paying for it. I don't want those transactions traceable, Mr. Nichols. Not by the S.E.C., the I.R.S. or any of my ex-wives. You understand me, don't you? [ Chattering ] John, what do you want me to tell you? You gotta hang in there and be patient, my friend. I'm trying. Yeah, yeah. I know. Hold on, hold on. Stop. Stop. We got caught by the margin. It's gonna turn around. Yes. Yes, it is. Yes, it is. Yeah, you've gotta give it time... and just, yeah, be patient. Yeah. Okay. Yes. Yes. Okay. All right. Bye-bye. [ Man ] All right. Next up. Right? [ Intercom Beeps ] [ Nichols ] Chris. Yeah. Would you come in here, please? Who's that guy? A client. I need you to close out Abu Dhabi and Eritrea. Burn the records and bury the ashes. Go. Yeah. Jack. Can I have a word? Yeah. Willie, go on out to the truck. Pick up another load. It's all right. Go, go. I think you should take a look at this. I don't need to. I know what it says. Don't worry, Carl. I'll be gone by dark. I'm not asking you to leave, Jack. I'm asking you to have a conversation. Tramell says this subpoena's been chasing you for over a year now. It's gonna catch up with you sometime. I'm not going back. I'm not saying you should. But a year's a long time to spend looking over your shoulder. A lifetime of that's gonna drive you out of your mind. Whatever I've done I've paid for in full. All I've got left is my freedom. I'm not lettin' them take that away from me. Freedom. What kind of freedom's this, Jack? You're runnin' away. What do you want from me, Carl? What do you want? I want you to trust me, Jack. I am your friend. I'm sorry. Look. I can't remember the many times you saved my life. But I do know that I owe you. You've lost a lot, Jack. I know that. I know that. When you called me up for the first time in-- What? Ten years? I hoped you were maybe looking for more than just a place to stay. I'm trying to find a way to make some sense of it all. It's a normal impulse, especially for people like us. Yeah, except you found what you were looking for. Yeah. [ Hammering ] Damn it. Carl. Carl! I just meant it's different for me. You never asked me why I quit. I figured you would have told me if you wanted me to know. While I was in Beirut-- a counterinsurgency operation. I was holding a suspect. The attack window was open. Our time was limited. I was sure I had the right guy, but he wasn't giving me the information I needed, so I kept pushing. Pushed him hard... until he finally told me what I wanted to hear... right before he died. He wasn't the right guy, Jack. The intel was bad. - I lost 14 men and 21 civilians that day. - Carl, that's the job. People like you and me, Jack-- We don't-- We don't keep score by counting how many lives we've saved, but by how many we've lost. You know, I'm not so sure I have found what I was lookin' for. But I have found a way to live with myself. It took a long time. The first thing I had to do was stop running. I meant what I said, Jack. You can stay here. We'll fight this thing together. Sorry. Don't worry about Tramell. The state department's not the only place with money. I appreciate what you're trying to do, Carl, but this is my problem. I'm not gonna let it become yours. Remember what the lieutenant used to say about trouble? "Comes cheap, leaves expensive." Yeah. Yeah. What you've done with this place. The school, what you've done for the boys-- It's worth protecting. You and I both know it'd be better for everyone if I leave. I'm sorry, Jack. Me too. [ Chuckling ] Me too. Thank you, Carl. I mean that. Thank you for everything. Always. Yeah. - Where is he going? - I'm not sure. But he's leaving. Yeah. He is. You are just a boy. You do not know what you are talking about. What do you know? This isn't even your country, yeah? - Hey, hey, hey! What's goin' on? - Thomas is talking nonsense. He's spreading rumors about Juma. Rumors? They are not rumors. Juma's soldiers have been crossing the border and stealing our children. Juma has no soldiers, and he has no weapons. Everyone knows that. My cousin is missing. He went to the market yesterday, and he has not returned. Then it was gunrunners that took him, or someone from the diamond mines. My brother is in town with James. You see that, hmm? Now you have the boy worried. He should be worried. We should all be worried. Stop it, both of you. Finish up work. I'll go into town and see if we can find out what's going on. - Fine, but you are wasting your time. - [ Thomas ] Take this. I thought I told you kids not to go into town without telling me. Desmond never listens to anyone but Desmond. Where'd he go? Playing football. There's a field just past the bridge. I'll be back soon. Benton. You're not seriously worried about all of this, are you? If Juma was making trouble, we would have heard something, no? Probably, but this is Sangala. I'm not taking any chances. [ Children Laughing ] [ Thomas Chattering ] [ Excited Shouting ] Yo. Hey. Pass it! Pass it! [ Bleating ] Left, left, left! Pass the ball, James. The ball! What'd you think that was, huh? Nothing. What you say, "nothing"? Now you wanna fight. Oh, wow! He's so powerful, guys. Give him a hand. Oh, you just threw the ball away. Now you wanna fight. Now you wanna fight. Yes. Go fetch the ball if you want the ball. Go fetch it. - Run! - [ Machine Gun Fire ] [ Boys Screaming ] [ Machine Gun Fire Continues ] Oh, no! [ Men Shouting ] [ Speaking Native Language ] [ Whistling ] [ Shouting Continues ] [ Shouting Continues ] Yeah. Yeah. One at a time. One at a time. One at a time! You are now soldiers in the People's Freedom Army. You will all have the honor of fighting the imperialists... until we have taken back our land. [ Radio Chatter ] Samuel tells me you are from the American school in Okavango. These Americans make our people slaves. But we will free you, and we will free the other children... so they can become soldiers. Take them. Let's go. Come on. Go, go! [ Laughing ] Tell me your name. Seville. Louder. Seville. Are you a baby, Seville? I asked you a question. Are you a baby? No. Good, because we need soldiers, Seville. Not babies who wet themselves. Now stop crying, or I'll stop you myself. [ Man ] Commander! Put them in the truck! Let's go! Go. Go! Faster! Don't lose them! - [ Gasping ] - What are you doing? Idiot! They are no good to us dead! Go! This is an historic day marking the swearing in... of America's first female president. Behind me, the sidewalks along Pennsylvania Avenue are crowded with spectators... here to catch a glimpse of the passing motorcade. With the inauguration less than two hours away, President Daniels is scheduled to meet with his successor here at the White House... to review final details for the transfer of power. Their respective transition teams have been working together for several weeks... to ensure a smooth turnover. [ Chuckling ] Stop looking at me like that. Watching you get dressed is almost as fun as watching you get undressed. Uh-huh. Shouldn't you be getting dressed? We got time. Mmm. Hey, you need to shave. You're gonna be on TV. Mmm, mmm. Stop it. [ Cell Phone Ringing ] [ Beeps ] Hello. Uh, I need to talk to you, Rog. Chris? Yeah. Look. Uh, I think I might be in trouble. Okay. You using again? That's not what this is about. You didn't answer my question. I can't, uh-- I can't really talk on the phone, okay? I was hoping that I could, um-- I could meet up with you face to face. - Now? - Rog, hang on a second. Chris? I know. I know, I know. It's terrible timing. Believe me, I know. But I wouldn't be asking if it wasn't really important. - I gotta leave in 45 minutes, man. - I can be there in 20. Chris-- I am not gonna stay long. I swear, Rog. Just please. Do this for me? - Fine, but I'm outta here in 45 minutes. - Thank you. Thank you. You're letting Chris come here right now? He's having some kind of relapse or something. What am I supposed to do? Exactly! What are you supposed to do? - Make sure he calls his sponsor? I don't know. - This is so Chris. He's been a friend for a really long time. He got me my job, which, if he hadn't, I wouldn't have met you. Don't. Stop. Hmm? Hmm? [ Sighs ] Just don't be late for your mother's inauguration. Okay? [ Man ] I always liked his advice too. Madam President? Not yet. This way. Nice to see you. Hello. [ Sighs ] How are you feeling? Excited. Nervous. You should be. In a few hours, you're going to be the most powerful person in the world. As if you're not already hard enough to live with. Ma'am. Mr. Taylor. Tom. The president apologizes he could not be here to greet you in person. But something urgent has come up. Something urgent? Whatever it is, Tom, it's gonna land on my desk in about two hours. Could I just have a moment? I'm sorry. Don't be. Go ahead. Our embassy in Sangala just got word of an imminent coup. How imminent? Very. Where's the president now? He's in the TelePresence suite. He's on a secure line with Prime Minister Matobo. Mr. President, my country's in crisis, and here is the proof. [ Beeps ] This video was taken moments ago. Juma's moving his forces toward the capital as we speak. Mr. Prime Minister, this news has caught us all by surprise. But our priority here in Washington is to ensure the safety of you and your family. My priority is to defend my country from this monster Juma, and the only way that can happen is if you accelerate... the military assistance your congress has already pledged to us. Unfortunately, I'm not in a position to make that happen. Certainly not today. What about your successor? Will she be in a better position to help us? I'm afraid I can't speak for her. - Will you excuse us for a moment? - Yes, of course. [ Beeps ] You were right, sir. Taylor does want to weigh in on this. Where is she? Just outside. - [ Beeps ] - I am sorry, Mr. Prime Minister, but I have to cut this short. The president-elect is waiting for me. Please, sir, convey to her my request for military assistance. I'll do that. Thank you, sir. [ Beeps ] Well, my first day. Mr. President. Senator Taylor. Tom told me what's happening in Sangala. It is a damn tough situation. I don't understand. How could Juma raise an army without our getting wind of it? We disarmed him three years ago. The U.N.'s been monitoring the situation. Not closely enough apparently. Then you have no idea who's supplying him? All we know is Juma's secured some fairly advanced weapons systems, which is why Prime Minister Matobo... is asking for our military assistance. And what did you tell him? The truth. It's not a viable option. You don't agree. We have troops in the region. A show of force might make Juma blink. And if it doesn't, we get caught up in another civil quagmire... halfway around the world. Now, that is a hard sell. Especially when there's nothing in Sangala worth protecting. No natural resources, no substantial economic ties, nothing that threatens our national security. The last time Juma made a power grab, he ignited a tribal war that killed tens of thousands of civilians. Our involvement could avert a genocide. And this war will be tragic too. But it isn't our war. Which is why I've ordered the ambassador to begin evacuating all nonmilitary nationals. I think that's a mistake. I don't want any Americans caught in the cross fire when Juma starts shooting. Closing our embassy sends a signal to the world... that we are willing to sell out a democratic ally... to a war criminal. I appreciate your idealism. I can't say the same for your cynicism. Let's talk after you've been sitting in my chair for a while. And until then, we still have some transition business to go over, so I suggest we get started. [ Intercom Beeps ] Send in Tom Lennox. [ Woman On Intercom ] Yes, Mr. President. [ Women Chattering ] Mademoiselle. S'il vous plat. [ Speaking French ] [ French Continues ] Merci, merci. [ Chattering Resumes ] [ Gunshots ] No. Desmond! Desmond! Desmond. Desmond! Open your eyes. Open your eyes! That's it. Stay with me, Desmond. Stay with me. Open your eyes. Open your eyes. Do not go to sleep. Do you understand? Do not go to sleep. Good lad. Don't go to sleep. [ Boy ] Then you're out. No. It's not heavy. I can carry it. I want to go with you. Me and my brother Desmond too. - We can carry your things and work for you. - No. Why not? Because you can't. I'm going alone. "People who like to be alone are witches," my grandfather says. Well, there you go. Your grandfather wouldn't be happy if you left here with a witch, now, would he? He would want me to go to America. His favorite was Elvis Presley. I'm not going to America. Where are you going then? I don't know yet. "I don't know yet" is better than here. You sure about that? Here doesn't seem so bad to me. Mr. Benton is very nice, but there are too many ghosts walking around. Ghosts? My mother, my father and my three sisters. They live in the bush and come out at night. But you wouldn't see them because you are Poo-mui. Poo-mui? A white person. Willie, you and I are friends, right? Then I want you to do me a favor, as a friend. I want you to stay here with Mr. Benton and help take care of the other boys. Can you do that? You promise? I promise. Okay. Thank you. It's not fair. How come he has to go, and we have to stay? It's not fair or unfair. It's just the way it is. Come. Help me finish. We're almost done. Jack! Benton from Direct Connect. He says he needs to talk to you. - Carl? - Jack. James is dead. Desmond's been shot. - What happened? - Juma's raising an army. Desmond says they're headed for the school. They're coming for the boys, Jack. You got to get them into the shelter. Thomas knows where it is. How many guns are coming? Maybe a dozen. I don't know. You'll have to hold them off till I get there. Carl, you need to call the embassy, get them to send some marines out here. I've been trying. I can't get through. Jack, go into my room. You'll find what you need in a locker under my sink. The key's on top of the cupboard. How far out are you? Maybe five minutes. Jack, don't let them take my kids. - Don't let them take the children. - Carl, I won't. Everybody! Everybody, I want you to listen! I want you to go to the shelter with Thomas. He's gonna take you there now! Go! What's going on? I don't have time to explain, Willie. Just go with Thomas and ring the bell. Now! What about my brother? Your brother's with Mr. Benton. Everybody, follow me! Juma's men are coming. Do you have a weapon? How do you know this isn't just another rumor? Do you have a weapon or not? If they are coming, I will talk to them. They will listen to me. Save your helmet for the parade. They are coming. Two of our boys have already been shot. The United Nations remains neutral in this matter. You son of a bitch. You still want to talk to them? I didn't think so. Why don't you go hide in the shelter with the other children? [ Bell Ringing ] [ Willie Shouting ] [ Bell Ringing Continues ] [ Shouting ] Willie! Enough. Let's go. Let's go, Willie. Come on. Come on! Hurry, hurry. [ Thomas ] Boys, go! Come on, Russell! You're the last? Yeah. Wait! Wait for me. [ Chattering ] [ Whistling ] [ Man Speaking Native Language ] Go! Find the boys! Find them! Fire! Come! [ Native Language Continues ] [ Grunts ] [ Man Shouting In Native Language ] [ Shouting Continues ] [ Gunshot ] [ Youssou ] Keep going! This way! There, there! [ Gunshot ] [ Grunts ] [ Rifle Cocks ] No. Do not kill him yet-- Not until he tells us where the children are hiding. Bring him. Stay here. Stay here. Where are you going? I'll be back in a bit. [ Groaning ] [ Youssou ] String him up. [ Native Language ] Tie him up. Yeah. [ Chattering ] [ Youssou ] I want him to suffer. [ Chattering ] U.S. citizens only. What about her? She's not American. She has family in the States. I have a sister in Chicago. She has a job. She needs to sponsor you. By then it will be too late. My husband died fighting Juma. Juma will kill me. He will kill my child. There's a U.N. camp across the eastern border. How will I get there? I have no transportation. The buses are all full. I cannot walk. I'm sorry. Whatever you want me to do for you, I will do. Please. Just take me from here. [ Helicopter Whirring ] Anything at all. I can't. I'm sorry. Sir, it's Carl Benton. Please, don't let them kill my baby! Please! Please! - Benton. - I've been trying to get through to you. Yeah, our lines are overloaded. Juma's men are here. They're raising an army. We know. You know? Yeah, we don't know how he managed to pull it off. No one saw it coming. But he's got soldiers moving in on the capital. They're here right now, Frank. They're at my school. - You have to send some marines to help. - I can't spare any. They're all being deployed for the evacuation. - Evacuation? - The orders came down from the president. We're rolling up all U.S. nationals. We already started ferrying people to the border. Look, I got 14 kids hiding in a shelter, and one that's gonna bleed to death if he doesn't get medical attention. If you want us to get you out, get here on your own. The last chopper's leaving in an hour. Look, Frank. D-Don't strand me like this, please. My hands are tied, Carl. Frank-- Tramell, please. Sorry. Please don't-- Damn it! [ Whispers ] Damn it. [ Grunts ] I'm running out of ways to ask the question. Where are the children? Again. - We have searched all the buildings, sir. - Keep looking. You're wasting your time. They're not gonna find anything. I told you they're not here. Wait. You're lying. No, I'm not. If you wanna find soldiers for your army, you're gonna have to look somewhere else. Where... are the children? I told you-- I don't know. - [ Sizzling ] - [ Jack Screaming ] [ Willie ] Oh, Jack. [ Screaming Continues ] [ Grunts ] [ Grunting ] I will keep doing this until you beg me to kill you. But I won't kill you even then. [ Grunts ] Not until you tell me... what I want to know. Please-- Please, no! No! I'll show you where the kids are. Tell me. I need to show you. They're in an underground shelter. No. You will tell me where this shelter is! Okay. About 200 meters up the footpath. Behind the tree line. There's a wooden hatch under a mound of dirt. Please, just-- Please. [ Sobbing ] Get the children. I will stay here with him. Don't worry. Once I have these children, I will kill you quickly. [ Groans ] [ Chamber Clicks Twice ] [ Gunshots ] [ Grunting ] - [ Yells ] - [ Groans ] You all right, Jack? Yeah. The kids are in the shelter. How is Desmond? He's lost a lot of blood. The border's five hours from here. I don't think he's gonna make it. I'm gonna try and get 'em to the embassy. They've started evacuating already. How are you gonna get the kids asylum? They're not U.S. nationals. I've got sponsorship papers. Tramell's got to let them in. But I have to go now, Jack. The last chopper leaves in an hour. You all right? Go. Go! And, Jack, good luck. Stay here. Jack may need our help. And if they catch you, they will make you tell them where we are. You are endangering the rest of us. We wouldn't have been in danger... if you had done something about Juma instead of looking the other way. Right. Everyone out. Quickly. Go to the bus. Quickly. Thomas, go get Desmond. He's in the jeep by the end of the footpath. Quickly, quickly, quickly. Go to the bus. Go to the bus. Go to the bus. Where is my brother? Thomas has gone to get him. Then he's all right? He will be. He will be. Go to the bus. Quickly, quickly. [ Chattering In Native Language ] Desmond. It's not as bad as it looks. Wait. Listen up! Listen up! Everyone, listen. We're taking the bus into the city. Once we're on the road I'll explain everything that's happening. All right? But we have to move now. On the bus. Move. Quickly. Quickly. Solenz! Where you going? I told Mr. Bauer before. The United Nations remains neutral in this conflict. A U.N. escort might help us get where we need to go. Solenz! [ Jack ] Let him go! He's just trying to save his own ass because he knows the children are a target. You're gonna need my help, Carl. Juma's men are gonna set up roadblocks, checkpoints all the way into the city. I got one of the soldiers' walkies. We can use it to try and avoid them. Jack, you won't have to go anywhere near the embassy. Just help me get the kids to the city. You can head to the border from there. Let's go. Can you take it easy? Just keep your hands where I can see 'em. I told you, he's expecting me. Hey, Rog! R-Rog, can you call your watchdog off, please? Agent Vossler, he's a friend of mine. You can let him in. Your friend's jacked up on something. I'll take care of it. It's all right. I'll be outside. Thank you. Look, man, um, I know that my timing right now must, you know, suck. So thank you. It's just, I'm-- I think I'm in a little bit of trouble here. So-- What kind of trouble? Coke? Pills? Don't get all righteous on me, Rog. Okay? I seem to remember most nights you partying me under the table. - That was a long time ago. - Not that long ago. You got five minutes, so talk fast. Uh, okay. Couple months ago Nichols calls me into his office. Says he wants me to manage a special project. Special project? That's what he calls it. He says he knows I've taken some serious hits in the stock market, and he's gonna give me a chance to recover my losses. I mean, the money he paid me-- Rog. [ Chuckling ] It was crazy. I mean, the money was really crazy. All I had to do was keep my mouth shut. What'd he have you do, Chris? Open a few offshore accounts, move money in and out, that type of thing. So you helped Nichols embezzle money from his own firm. Yeah, that's what I thought I was doing at first. But, Rog, three days ago I recognized the prefix on one of the accounts. It's something the Justice Department has red-flagged for traders to report. So, I do a little digging and, uh, turns out that the, uh-- the account holder... is on the terrorist watch list. Yeah. Yeah. Who is it? I don't know. I don't know, Rog. I don't wanna know. Frankly, it's all getting a little too weird for me. This morning there was this creepy guy in Nichols's office who-- Look, I don't know what he's doing. I don't want to have anything to do with it. I'm willing to turn state's evidence. Yeah? Good. You should go to the F.B.I. Man, I was just thinking that, uh-- [ Sniffs ] I could probably cut a much better deal... if we take this directly to your mother. Y-You want my mother to clean up your mess? Chris, what do you expect me to say to that? I don't know, Rog. Uh, how about, "I'm sorry to hear that you're in trouble, Chris, but you're a friend of mine... and I'm gonna do whatever I can do to help you out"? [ Sighs ] Do you even have any evidence? [ Scoffs ] - I'm working on it. - What does that mean? What does it mean? It means, um-- Nichols asked me to destroy some records. I didn't do it. I, um-- I sent them to my hard drive at home instead. They're coded, but, you know, they're probably traceable. [ Footsteps Approaching ] - Hello, Chris. - Hey, Sam. - You look great. - Thank you. We really need to leave now. We're already pushing it. Agent Vossler's in the car waiting. I'll meet you there. I'm right behind you. [ Whispers ] Okay. - See you at work later? - Right. [ Door Closes ] I have to go. I know. I know, I know, I know. If I forward you these records, will you at least show them to your mother? I'm not talking to anybody until I see them for myself. Okay, all right. That's-- Look, Rog, thank you. Just check your e-mail in one hour. Clean yourself up. Okay? Yeah. [ Men Chattering ] Sixteen mortar teams supported by 20 forward observers. Make sure we all have the same encryption codes. And have a backup in case government try to jam communication. Sir, General Juma is here. Welcome home, General. Colonel Dubaku. Look what you've built here. Our American friends have been very helpful. Did they send us the Howitzers? Yes. We have them in position about 20 kilometers from the capital. We can hit any target in the city. All we need is your order to begin the bombardment. Sir. One of our checkpoints. Excuse me, General. - Yes? - Colonel, this is Lieutenant Kintu. Checkpoint Delta. We have a man in custody, a U.N. relief worker. He was driving to his base, but we have detained him for questioning. He says he has information about your brother. - What sort of information? - He says your brother is dead, sir. [ Gasps Quietly ] No. Your brother and his men, they were ambushed at the American school. He says that he can help us find the man who killed your brother. Hold it steady. [ Groaning ] Good. Thank you, Willie. Desmond, you sure the bandage isn't too tight? Yeah. Be right back. Managed to stop the bleeding, but Desmond's fever is spiking. If we don't get him to a hospital soon, he's gonna go into shock. We're five kilometers from the city. Carl, I'm really sorry about the school. I know how much you put into it. Just a bunch of cement and two-by-fours, right? What the hell was I thinking, letting myself believe that things were finally different here, that this country had turned a corner? [ Dubaku On Radio ] The bus is from the American school. They are heading into the city from the Okavango. There is only one of two roads they can go. I'm seeing patrols on both. [ Man On Radio ] Sir, this is Patrol One. We have not seen a bus matching that description. - Where is your position? - Heading east, one kilometer west of Okavango Junction. -Jack, they're right in front of us. -Let me know when you have them. Everybody hold on! Hold on! [ Children Shouting, Chattering ] [ Engine Off ] Quiet. What is it? Rebel patrol. [ Jeep Passing By ] Carl, we can't get back on that road. We'll walk to the embassy. If we follow the river, it'll take us to the city. - Desmond will not make it that far. - Then you help him, Thomas. We're not getting back on that road. [ Willie ] Where are we going? [ Carl ] To the embassy. Let's go! Quickly! Quickly! [ Whispering ] Hurry up. Hurry up. Quickly. Quickly. I'll take him. I'll take him. Take this. Take this. [ Whispers ] Stay here. [ Carl ] Willie! Willie, hurry up! Your wife will be out in a minute. She'd better be, or she's gonna be late for her inauguration. What's going on in there? Well, I really can't discuss that, but, of course, when your wife comes out... you're certainly free to ask her. I asked you a simple question, Tom. If you can't answer it, fine. But I don't need your permission to talk to my wife. Well, I would hope not. If you will excuse me, I have to continue packing up my office. The decision book. Master protocols for the command and control... of our nuclear arsenal. I never knew how much I didn't know till I read that book. Are the gold codes in here? Not yet. Dan Wilcox will deliver them to your designate. All right then. Well, if we're finished here I should get going. Join me for a drink, a toast to your administration. As much as I'd like to, it's still a little early in the morning. - You sure? - Yes. To your administration. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. President. Thank you, Mr. President. Please extend my gratitude to your transition team... for all they've done. You know what the talking heads are saying? They're saying that I lost this election because I didn't want to win it. They're saying that... my heart wasn't in it. What about you? Me? Do you agree with their opinion? I don't believe there's a simple answer to that question. [ Laughing ] You are right. Nothing about this job lends itself to simple answers, just, uh, jagged edges and moving parts, most you won't even see coming till they've smacked you in the head. So, uh, be careful, Madam President. See you at the inauguration. [ Man Chattering, Indistinct ] Are you all right? I'm not sure yet. Gentlemen. We just got word of a coup in Sangala. Daniels has ordered the embassy to evacuate without even consulting me. Is it the right call? Right or wrong, he should have brought me in on the decision. Maybe he's still bitter about the election. Noah Daniels isn't that vindictive. You think he has a reason for pulling out of Sangala before you take office. Maybe. I'll call Ethan from the car. If Daniels is hiding anything about Sangala, he'll be able to dig it up. [ Man On Radio ] It's definitely the bus from Okavango. They were here not too long ago, at least a dozen boys. I don't care how many boys. How many men? Just Benton? - Or is he with that bastard that killed my brother? - There were two men. - Along the river would be their fastest route. - Good. Colonel Dubaku, I am sorry to hear about your brother, but I need you here. Are you ordering me to stay? A campaign is just beginning, and you are critical to its success. There will be time for you to avenge your brother after we have taken power. The man who killed my brother... is heading toward the American embassy. They are evacuating within an hour. That is all the time I have and all the time I need. Sir! Excuse me, General. Sir, the men are ready, sir. Go. Go. [ Anchorman ] President-elect Taylor... will make her way to the steps of the U.S. Capitol where, standing before thousands of American citizens and-- [ Sighs ] [ Beeping ] [ Pills Rattling ] [ Thumps ] Is this everything, Mr. Whitley? You've been stealing financial records from your office. Those files are private property and I'm here to recover them. Is this everything? Uh, look, I-- I saw something didn't look right, took it home to check it out. It's probably a mistake-- Just calm down. Answer my question. Yeah, yeah, yeah. That's everything. It's all there. - What about your laptop? - Um, it's, uh-- - It's in my briefcase, if you want to check it. - Did you make any hard copies? No, I swear-- I-- I barely even looked at those files. - Who have you shown them to? - No one. N-Nobody. So, um, just erase it, take whatever you want, then you leave. Okay? Are we cool? Whoa. Whoa! Hey, do we look like fools to you? Huh? Do we? Do we? No! No! No! Then don't talk to us like we are. Okay-- Sit down. Open your shirt, Mr. Whitley. Why? Your shirt. What are you doing? You're going to tell us everything you know, and we'll know if you're lying. Just leave it alone, okay? Chris asked me not to tell anyone. I am not "anyone." Come on, Sam. I don't trust him. Then trust me. - We're here, sir. - You made great time, Edward. [ People Chattering ] Look, I know that Chris is your friend. It's just this idea of you having a secret with him-- I gave him my word I wouldn't tell anyone. You need to respect that. Okay? [ Sighs ] Okay? Okay. Okay. Big turnout. [ Shutters Clicking ] It's crazy having a mother who's the hottest ticket in town. [ Chattering Continues ] [ Phone Ringing ] Vossler. It took some doing, but we managed to recover the files. What's our exposure? Unclear. We're working on it now. Find out and call me back. [ Woman ] Hi. How are you? [ Chris Whimpering ] [ Muffled Screaming ] Clear. Willie. Take Desmond. That's it. Thomas, stay close, okay? Jack. There's a road through those trees, takes us to the city. We should be safe when we get there. You follow the riverbed. That'll take you to the border. You'll get there before dark. You sure? Jack, we'll be fine. Thanks for helping us get this far. Yeah. You take care of yourself. Always. [ Helicopter Rotors Whirring, Faint ] Carl. Carl. [ Rotors Continue Whirring, Louder ] Kids in the trees. In the trees! Now! Move! [ Carl ] Run! Quickly! There. Line them up. Hurry up! Hurry up! Take cover! Take cover! Hurry up! - Fire! - Take cover! Quickly! [ Jack ] Boys, keep running! Keep running! Don't look back! Keep running! - Move! - [ Machine Gun Fire Continues ] Now he's coming behind. [ Rifle Cocks ] I got a shot. Roll 'em out. Now! - [ Gunshots ] - [ Machine Gun Fire ] They're going down. Go, boys! Come on! Now! Hurry up! Go! Go! Go! Go! Pull it up! Pull it up! [ Alarm Blaring ] [ Jack ] Come on. Come on. It's all right. Let's go. [ Whispering ] Willie, come back. Come back. Willie, get back here. Stop. Stop! Don't-- Don't move! [ Clicks ] Jack! Stay there. Don't move. Don't come near me. - I didn't want to leave this. - I know, I know. It's all right. Go with Thomas. Willie, it's all right. Come with me. Slowly. Slowly. Stay on the path. Go with the other boys. Go. Forget it, Jack. Just go. Take the kids and go. Damn it, Jack. There's nothing we can do. There. Okay. It's round, in a gray casing, with a Cyrillic "b" and the number "291" stenciled on the side. Spring-loaded. Russian antipersonnel mine. Five kilo. I take my weight off, and that's it. I'm gonna try and disassemble the trigger mechanism. - It's got an anti-tamper system. - I'll find a work-around. -Even if you had the tools, it'd take more than an hour. -There's gotta be a kill switch. There's no time, Jack. Stop. Just give me a second. Jack, stop. Stop! It's all right, Jack. I can die like this. Just-- Just take the kids to the embassy. Make sure they're safe. Carl, don't do this. Shh, shh, shh. Take-- Take these papers. Sponsorship papers. Give them to Tramell. Please, Jack. Please. Give me the rifle. I'm gonna buy you some time, Jack. Maybe more. Yeah. Go on. Go. Go. Go. Go ahead with Jack. I'll be right behind. - Mr. Benton! - I'll catch up. Go. Go. We gotta go. We gotta go. Please. Come on. Let's go. [ Thomas ] Let's go. [ Sobbing ] [ Men Chattering In Native Language ] Yes. Okay, I'll tell him. Colonel. Sir. We cannot follow them into the city. It's still under government control. Since when do you start giving orders? I spoke to Udo. He has some men... inside the city looking for him, looking for Benton and the other man. With the children they won't be hard to find. Well, I will find them and kill them myself, even if I have to go into the city. Go. Find them. [ Chattering Continues ] Colonel Dubaku, look. [ Chattering Continues ] Go. [ Native Language ] Who are you? I'm Benton. - Where is your friend? - Which one? [ Screams ] Where is he? I don't know what you're talking about. [ Groans ] [ Panting ] All right. All right. [ Muttering ] He's taking them-- - What? - He's taking them-- What are you saying? Hmm? What are you saying? He's taking them to-- [ Groans ] Bring him to me. [ Groans ] Go to hell. [ Explosion ] What was that? Nothing. Just keep moving. Come with me. Go on. Come on. Move. Nice to see you. Congratulations to your family. [ "Stars and Stripes Forever" ] - Expecting a call? - Hmm? It's about Chris, isn't it? He was supposed to send me something 15 minutes ago. Call him later. Your mother's here. [ Shutters Clicking ] It's been a long journey, Madam President. I'm afraid we're just getting started. Henry. Ethan. Our Africa group is preparing a brief on Sangala. You'll have it on your desk as soon as you're done here. Good morning. Good morning. Congratulations. Thank you. Madam President, it's an honor. Good morning. Thank you so much. You look beautiful, Madam President. Thank you, Samantha. Father. Roger. Samantha. Nice to see you on time for once. Mm-hmm. [ Chuckles ] How are you holding up? It still doesn't feel quite real. It will soon enough. Whitley needed some encouragement, but he told my man everything. How much does Roger Taylor know? - Nothing you need to worry about. - He knows Nichols was involved. All he knows is that his desperate, drug-addicted friend told him some crazy story. He's got no evidence. If he finds Nichols, he could find me. Not without evidence. Sir, Whitley's no longer a problem. We limited the damage. But you haven't eliminated it. [ President-elect Taylor ] Thank you. Keep your eye on Taylor. How much farther to the embassy? Two more blocks that way. But we only have 10 minutes. As soon as we get there I'm gonna give you the paperwork. Give that to Mr. Tramell. He's gonna take care of everything. Then you're not coming? No. Where's Mr. Benton? - He's not coming. - Why? He's dead! No! He was supposed to be behind us! He said he was coming! Willie. Willie! Willie! He lied! Why? Stop it! Stop it! He lied to me? Why? Mr. Benton did not lie. He made one promise to all of you boys-- to protect you and make sure you were safe. Mr. Benton died to make sure that Juma's soldiers couldn't follow us. Mr. Benton died to make sure you could get to the embassy. Mr. Benton died to make sure that you would be safe. [ Sobbing ] I'm so sorry, but we have to go. It's what Mr. Benton would have wanted. Okay? You okay? Well, then let's go. Come on. Come on. We gotta go. Right away. It's okay. Come on. Let's go. Let's go. Stop. Stop. Thomas, take the boys. Hide behind the car. Now. Move. Move. Everybody, now. [ Bystanders Screaming ] [ Machine Gun Fire ] Kill the cockroach. - Kill the cockroach. - Put the gun down. Kill the cockroach. I don't want to hurt you. Just put the gun down. Willie, wait! Willie! I know you're scared. Just put the gun down. I'm not gonna hurt you. Just put the gun down now. Willie! See those boys? They're just like you. I'm trying to get them out of the country, somewhere safe where no one can hurt them. You can come with us. Just put the gun down. Come on. Just like me. Watch. See? It's going down. Like me. Come with me. I promise no one will hurt you. [ Helicopter Rotors Whirring ] No one will hurt you. Wait! [ Thomas ] Come on, Jack. We have to go. We have to go now! Boys! Come with me now! Come on! Let's go! Everybody hold hands! Come on! [ Panting ] [ Shouting, Chattering ] I need to speak to President Taylor. As soon as you get to Germany you will have direct access. You really need to go, Mr. Prime Minister. Mrs. Matobo is waiting. Keep moving! Stay right behind me! Stay behind me! [ Shouts ] Everybody hold on to the person behind you! Don't let go! Thomas, keep everyone together! [ Shouting Continues ] [ Jack ] Stay together! Stay together! Oh, please take us! Sergeant! I need to see Frank Tramell! He's expecting me! - Who are you? - Jack Bauer! We're almost there! Just stay with me! Everyone together. Don't worry, Desmond! We made it! We're going to America! Tramell! Listen to me! I've got 14 children seeking political asylum! All of them are R-1 status! One of them needs urgent medical care! Where's Benton? He's dead! Wait! Wait! I've got their paperwork! Show me. Keep Desmond up! There! It's all right. Stay with me. Come on! They appear to be in order. Good. Then open the gate and let 'em in! There's just one small problem-- They need the legal guardianship of a U.S. citizen. Guardianship? I already told you-- Benton is dead! He died getting these children here! Then don't let him have died in vain. Surrender to the subpoena, and the ambassador will waive the issue of guardianship. - Tramell, leave me out of this. - I'm afraid I can't do that. We are talking about innocent children. Whatever happens to them is all on you. You would leave these children out here in the street, knowing what you do about Juma? Damn it, Frank, they will be used as cannon fodder... or slaughtered in the soccer stadium for entertainment! I am giving you the chance to make sure that doesn't happen! The choice is yours. I don't have a choice, you son of a bitch. Open the gate. Hold on, boys! Hold on! Desmond, come on! No, no, no. You in first, Bauer. It's all right, Willie. It's all right. It's all right. Right. Take him into custody right now! Let 'em in! Let them in! Let them in! They're with me! Let 'em in, damn it! No! Those two are with me too! All of them! All of them! [ Grunts ] It's all right, Willie. Just go with them. Go with the soldiers. [ Soldier ] What about the choppers? [ Tramell ] All right, boys, come on. [ Jack ] It's all right. [ Man ] Raise your right hand and repeat after me. I, Allison Taylor, do solemnly swear-- I, Allison Taylor, do solemnly swear-- That I will faithfully execute the office of the president of the United States-- That I will faithfully execute... the office of the president of the United States-- [ Man ] And will, to the best of my ability, preserve, protect and defend... the constitution of the United States-- And will, to the best of my ability, preserve, protect and defend... the constitution of the United States-- So help me God. So help me God. Congratulations, Madam President. Thank you. Thank you, Chief Justice. Keep going. Keep going. When the founders of our country... boldly declared America's independence to the world, they knew that they derived their power to govern... from three basic human rights-- life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. Today... we rededicate ourselves... to the preservation of those inalienable rights. But even as we carry forth... the torch lit by those great men, we need to remember... its light doesn't always shine as brightly as it should. It flickers and grows dim... because of apathy, greed... and fear. De Tocqueville said, "In every democracy... the people get the government they deserve." Today... I am asking each of you... to help me give you... the government you deserve. We all share the responsibility... history has placed in our hands. The future-- Our future... depends on it.
