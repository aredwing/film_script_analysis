Huh? A Mexican? Let's go. I'm not gonna hit a blind man anyway. What's this about anyway? It's simple. Each puts money down, and then every one of us takes a punch at him. And then we do it again in different order. [knuckles crack] The ones that I make out lose. The others split the bank. [punch] [punch] [punch] [punch] [punch] [punch] [punches] [punch] You have lost. [men laugh] Next time you want to play, lose the bracelet. We need to go. I've got to get my money back. What's at stake? [screams] We go on. - Giddap! Giddap! - [neighing] [laughter] [toot] [toot] [kisses] [burps] [hisses] [laughing] [men laughing] [laughter continues] [horse neighs] No. The sheriff is not here. And the nearest town is a week's ride away. [laughing] [laughter continues] I can cash the bounty for you. [punch] [punch] [punch] [laughter] You've lost your touch. [coughs] You need a woman. Shit! [burps] You want to get your bounty back? We can play all night. [burping, laughing] Hit him now, if you can do it. You lost your bounty... to a blind man. To a handicapped veteran... who lost his eyes defending his country. But... if you want it back, you'll have to take it from a healthy man. You wouldn't want to shoot a lawman. Would you? [laughing] [laughter continues] $500. You can buy a new life for that. How could she take any pleasure with you? Vodka... doesn't accept a straight line. That's why those drunk on vodka... move with no coordination. No balance. They dance. The ones drunk on whisky, they're up, down, hit the ground... and don't get up. She's sure friendly... when she wants to be. Ain't she? No, sir. Not a word. [gulp] Suppose I shoot you? You wanna know what it sounds like? [chuckles] [giggling] Drop the gun. [screams] [gunshot] [men screaming] [gunshot] - [screaming] - [gunshot] [gunshot] - I got him! - [gunshot] - I got him! - [clicking] [screams] Fuck! [screaming] The drifter shot him! He's run! You were a tracker in the war. Yeah. And I was... good. Aren't you gonna go after him? You are the sheriff! Ah. And you got amped up for the hanging. The drifter's hit. All we need is to pick him up. Nobody gets hanged unless I say so. Not without the law! # [indistinct whispering] You know where it is. Blood money. You want to play a soldier again? I'll be back. He was taller than you! I got him. I never miss. Did you see her eyes? I'll put it back where it belongs. No gun has that range. He's not gonna know what hit him. We're not going pigeon hunting. # [woman chanting] There will be no hanging without a trial. Why would he circle around? Doesn't make sense. He's going east. Bad country. We'll cut him off at the pass. [panting] [whinnies] Nothing. There won't be any hanging. This has his name on it. [sniffs] Could this be him? You know what that means? What? Absolutely nothing. But you did not know that. What is it now? Surrender, or I'm coming in! [gunshots] [laughing] [shooting continues] [shooting stops] [glass shatters] [horse whinnies] He was here, all right. You'll never catch him. Have you ever wondered why he doesn't cover up his tracks, while I'm getting further and further away from the town, which I left un... ...protected? [simmers] [panting] Anyway, he will never be able to follow the tracks. And... I'm heading back. [glass shatters] It's the booze! [horse neighs] You've run out of booze! That's why, you drunken dumbshit! That's enough! # [female vocalizing] [woman] Call me wherever you want. You can call me "Bitch" or "Pussy." "Baby." "Honey." "Love." "Sweetheart." "Sunshine." Yeah. You better call me "Sunshine." We met in the rain. Please, like before. [hammering] [grunts] [neighs] [neighs] [neighs] Where are these fucking tracks? I want to... to send a telegram. [telegraph tapping] [hammering] [fly buzzing] No bad habits? No. Just bad company. [fly buzzing] What's the matter? I thought you got some more meat last night. I got no quarrel with him. He drew us in. He was a tall man, wasn't he? I'm gonna have to check the thickness of his neck. To make an adequate noose, I have to take everything into consideration If the rope is too thin, it won't break his spine. Not without the law. Give me a smoke. I thought that you don't smoke. I do now. [knock on door] A telegram. [man coughing] [coughing] [neighs] It's the sheriff's horse. How did it get here? Where are the others? Relish? [coughs] Would bread be all right? Chaser? We only have a porter. You want it in a tall or short glass? Please. Please! [train whistle] And you will take off my clothes. First, the skirt. It will probably get ripped. Slightly. It will take awhile before you will take off all the rest. And my breasts... will be firm, and my legs, strong. You will kiss my nipples. And my stomach will be hard. And after... After, we'll lay down side by side, and we'll be smoking our cigarettes. We will talk... really quietly to each other, although we could very well be speaking out loud... in the bed. [chuckles] I will feel... slightly uncomfortable. And you will feel the taste of my hair in your mouth. There will be... plenty of little pale scars on my stomach. You'll feel them with your fingers. I know... you'd like them to be there. You will kiss each one of them... once. And I will be shy no more. And later... Later you will stop being shy, and I will be kissing you. And later... Later the whole room will smell of you. Not of me, but of you. You never loved me. No! I was never anything but a barmaid. [screaming] [screaming continues] You know what happens to an eyeball when it gets punches? Uhh! I could hit you in the nose. The bone goes right into the brain, and you'd be dead. Uhh! [whinnies] A perfect site for an ambush. We should go around. There! Wait! Yaah! [all yelling] [gunshots] [gunshots] [train whistle] [distant hammering] [hammering continues] [hammering continues] [hammering continues] [spits] [door closes] She doesn't like you... anyway. [snoring] [gunshots] [ricochet] I got him! [groaning] [train whistle] [hammering continues] I like what I see. [whinnies] [whinnies] I had a dream. I dreamed that I was a bad sheriff, and that I was drunk. That every one of my memories starts with a drink... and ends with a hangover. I dreamed that everyone I met... laughed at my last drinking binge, my last fight. That my woman didn't want to have a child with a drunk... got sick... and died. That I have no friends anymore, that everyone has left me, and that I am completely alone in this place. I dreamt that I wanted to forget about my drinking with all my strength. That... That I wanted to give up all the people I drink with, the saloon, the memories. I've dreamed that I could not run away from them. But it's only a dream, wasn't it? Talk back. [whistles] # [male chorus humming] [neighing] It was your baby. I wrote you about it many times, but there was never a reply. Later, I would only write to you to ask for money... for the baby. And there was just one letter that came from you. An army document. It said you got decorated and promoted. Then I wrote no more letters. I didn't want the baby anymore. I went down to the stable... with a stick. I did it by myself. It was laying down there. There was this little white dog which came to me... and started to whimper out loud. It whimpered louder and louder and wouldn't leave, attracted by the smell of blood. I heard someone coming, so I grabbed the dog. There will be no life for me here if they knew that I've killed the baby. When I left the stable that evening... I left two dead bodies behind. I knew I would be not able to have children ever again. Hit me. # [humming] It takes a lot of time to hang a man. [grunts] The rope... needs to be... tested three times. [grunting] I use a sandbag that's the same weight as he is. [chuckles] [choking] My-- My leg. If... my leg... m-my leg... [groaning] [horse snorts] Shit! [groaning] We need to get him. [neighs] [groaning] [muffled scream] [sobbing] # [chorus humming] I received no letters. I wore... a uniform. I looked good in gray. I used to be the best scout. Perhaps... the best in this country. He used to be... the best scout. Perhaps-- [coughs] the best... in the country. [coughs] He was... one of the finest men we had. [coughing] [neighs] [strikes match] [chuckling] [laughing] With you? Never with a man like you. [horse neighing] [gagging] Why can't you? My story is short. I like life stories, and I like them short. People should be able to tell a story of their stupid, short life in short. I hate men that ponder around forever. I'm different. Come here. Kneel down. Think this is Paris? Pig! How was it with that scumbag? I loved... every minute of it! Did he... or didn't he? [panting] # From June until September # # Hearts are innocent and gay # # For a few brief fleeting moments # # Summer love drives cares away # # Summer love comes oh so quickly # # Summer love goes oh so fast # # Summer love's a lonely highway # # For the broken hearts that pass # # Now summer love-- # [woman screaming] You don't know anything about the battle. [coughing] Four slugs I took in the gut. [coughs] He wouldn't let me die. [coughing] Yes or no? You remind me of my mother. # # I was born in the blast of a furnace of steel # # And I wondered what shape I would be # # I was hard, I was cold I was just a day old # # And I wondered what future I'd see # # Then a rough pair of hands fashioned pieces of steel # # And a handle of smooth silky wood # # And an arm held me out while the eye of a man # # Kept staring as hard as he could # # O whoa, whoa, whoa-whoa whoa-whoa, whoa # Good. I've got something that belongs to you. [gunshot] It's him. I told you. It's him. [gunshot] [neighs] # # # I tried to call out but my steel has no tongue # # To men, I am only a slave # # I've never forgotten that terrible day # # And that man that I couldn't save # # No one knows what it means to be held in a hand # # To be pointed and triggered to kill # # To be labeled a gun with no power to stop # # All the blood that man's shooting will spill # # O whoa, whoa, whoa-whoa whoa-whoa, whoa # # It's a pity a man cannot live to the age # # Of a mountain the desert or sea # # Only then would he learn that to kill or be killed # # Was something that needed to be # # Maybe someday, somehow when all men will meet # # They will bury their guns in the ground # # I hope that they bury me deep, so deep # # So deep that I'll never be found # # I'm a gun # # I'm a gun # # I'm a gun # # I'm a gun # # Till the day that man destroys me # # I'm a gun # # It's not the gun that kills a man # # It's the man who fires a gun that kills a man # # It's not the gun that kills a man # # I'm a gun # # A gun # I don't want any trouble. Get rid of your guns. It's gonna be all right. Keep your hands up and your fingers spread. You'll have a fair trial. Let's get out of this place. Together. You know you won't get away from here alive. The city... with the tall houses, with the streetlamps. [sobbing] Where the people take walks on the street in the evenings. [sobbing] Yeah. It could work. Yeah! [sobs] It could work! [Sheriff] You are finished. Give it up! Promise! I'm gonna count to three. Hold this. Hell no! I ain't no deputy. What's wrong with you? Are you sick or what? [no audible gunshots] [audio fades in] Don't touch me! [gunshot] Did you ever... He took the wedding ring off my hand before. The tears I cried... he thought it was the rain. Simply a whore. Not a profession. A position. [coughing] Major. [coughs] Hard day? Hard life. [coughing] [coughs] [coughing] [wheezing] [grunts] Could I fix you once more? No, thanks. I just had one. Is there any special way? Oh, no. Whatever you say. And then? And then... we'll live in the... big city. Together forever. # From June until September # # Hearts are innocent and gay # # For a few brief fleeting moments # # Summer love drives cares away # # Summer love comes oh so quickly # # Summer love goes oh so fast # # Summer love's a lonely highway # # For the broken hearts that pass # # Now summer love's infatuation # # In that carefree time of year # # But when autumn leaves start fallin' # # Summer love will disappear # # Summer love comes oh so quickly # # Summer love goes oh so fast # # Summer love's a lonely highway # # For the broken hearts that pass # # There's one chance in a hundred # # If good fortune smiles on you # # That your summer love will be true love # # And will last your whole life through # # Summer love comes oh so quickly # # Summer love goes oh so fast # # But if fortune smiles upon you # # Then your summer love will last # # Then your summer love will last # # Then your summer love will last #
