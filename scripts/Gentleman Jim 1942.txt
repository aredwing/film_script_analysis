Is this as close to the place as you can take us? Yeah, and this is too close for me. It wouldn't look very good in the newspapers, Charlie, if I was caught breaking the state laws. Which way do we go? Right down that street, sir. Just follow the crowd. You can't miss it. Come on. - Come on here, boy. - Show them what you got. There he is. - Show 'em what you got. - Come on, Mauler. Hey, Mauler. Are you coming out, or you gonna change your mind? The admission is $2, mister. What do you mean $2? It's supposed to be $1. I haven't got time to argue. This is a big fight. Get out of line. Well, how do you like these guys? What do they think this is, the opera? What are we gonna do? Come on, let's go home. No, wait a minute. Wait a minute. How much money have you got? - I have $1.30, I guess. - All right, give me your $1. - What're you gonna do, Jim? - Wait right here. - Here you are. Where's Callahan? - Inside. - Hey, Callahan. - Yeah. I wanna tip you off to something. You see that guy over there? - The tall fellow with no hat? - Yeah. Well, he's just had his pockets picked, and he's boiling. He says he's gonna get the cops. You better do something about it if you don't wanna be raided. - Thanks. - Quick. Come on, get in there. Wait a minute, wait a minute. I didn't do anything. Cut it out, cut it out. Get out of there. - What happened? - You're in, aren't you? Come on. Hey, Walter. Look up on the hill there. - Do you know who that is? - No. Who? That's Judge Geary. He's one of the directors of the bank. Yeah? Let's go and stand there. Maybe we'll get a chance to meet him. Come on. Come on, get this thing started, looks like rain. Now, Hoghead, I'm warning you. You won't get one cent for this fight if you choke him, bite him or stick your thumb in his eye. - You understand? - Oh, yeah? And you. If you get your finger in his mouth, it's your own fault. Are you ready? Come on. Come on, now. Are you ready? That a boy. Now, fight like gentlemen. I think I like Hoghead. I don't know. That Mauler looks awful big to me. It's an outrage. That's what it is, a scandalous outrage. I don't know what San Francisco's coming to. A decent, sport-minded man can't even go to a dog fight without being humiliated by these crazy state laws. Then why don't you change the laws, Judge? Because you big, muscle-bound tramps from the Barbary Coast have killed the fight game. But mark my words, all of you, there'll be some changes made in this town. How do you mean, Judge? The Olympic Club, young fellow. It stands for good, clean sport, and if we can't go to see fights, then by Godfrey we'll put them on ourselves. Do you mean with paid fighters, professionals? No. We brought a great instructor from England, Harry Watson, who taught the Prince of Wales. We'll take in a few clean-cut boys from good families, and if we can't make you fighters into gentlemen, we'll try to make some gentlemen into fighters. Hey, listen. Do you know what the Mauler told me about you coming over in the wagon? He said you were a big yellow bag of wind, he could lick you anytime, any place, anywhere. - Oh, he did, huh? - Yeah, but don't tell him I told you. Stand back, fellas. Give him some room now. Let's have plenty of room. That's it. All right, boys. Come on now, get in there and fight. Hey, hey, Jim. If the bank hears about this, we'll lose our jobs, sure. Hey. Hey, Jim. - Did you see what I just saw? - Yeah. - Judge Geary, wasn't it? - Yeah. Gee, we're gonna get fired sure, I know it. Looks like it. Walter, there's only one thing to be done. We gotta beat him to the punch. We gotta send in our resignations. All right, Jim, but... Gee, do you think we ought to do it? Sure. I've made up my mind. To the President, Comstock Bank. Dear Mr. Mclnnes... So old Judge Kinsey, the toughest man on the California bench, took one look at me in that mob and nearly dropped his gavel. "By gad, sir!" he barks. "You, a supreme court justice, caught at a prize fight. " Well, I can already see the newspaper headlines. I stood there like a chicken-thief with a hen in each pocket. I couldn't even open my mouth, when all at once this young fellow... What's his name? - Corbett. James Corbett. - Yeah. Well, Corbett steps up and says, "Your Honor, there's been a very serious mistake. "Judge Geary, here, is the director of the bank in which I'm employed. " Now Corbett says, "We were all three down on Pacific Street "looking at a piece of property the bank is interested in. "We happened to see this crowd, and so we walked over to investigate. "Naturally, we had no idea that there was a prize fight going on. "Why, people in our position would never dream of being seen in such company. " Says Corbett. - So old Judge Kinsey let you go, eh? - Scot- free. Apologized all over the place and gave everybody else 30 days. You sent for me, Mr. Mclnnes? But I want to give you this... Yes, Corbett. I understand you already know Judge Geary. Yes, sir. We've met. You did the bank a great service last night, young man. That was quick thinking. We like a man who can make good, fast decisions on his feet. Well, I don't know about the bank, but you certainly saved my skin. How long have you been with us, Corbett? Three years? Four, sir. Well, it's about time we raised your salary, anyhow. Starting next week, it'll be $12.50 a week. - Well, what happened, Jim? Are we fired? - Fired? I should say not. He wouldn't accept my resignation. He tore it up. - I got a raise. - A raise? $2.50 a week. - Are you kidding? - Kidding? Well, what about me? I was there, too. But you didn't talk up. Always remember that, Walter, my boy. That's the guy they pay off on, the guy who talks up. Why don't you go in there and assert yourself? Go on. Oh, I... I gotta go to lunch. If you'd like to come over here, Miss Ware... - Good morning, Miss Ware. - Good morning. - How would you like this, large bills? - No. All in silver, please. Well, it's gonna make a pretty big stack of cartwheels. Do you think you can carry them all by yourself? I should have brought a handbag. Father's in a big poker game over at the Olympic Club, and they won't play with anything else but silver. - Oh, I see. Did you say the Olympic Club? - Yes. Well, it happens to be just my lunchtime. I'll be very happy to carry this over for you, if you like. Oh, I think I could take it if I had something to carry it in. But thank you, anyway, - Mr. Corbett. - Oh, no trouble at all, Miss Ware. I'll have my assistant, Mr. Lowrie, put it in a bag for you. - You don't mind, do you, Walter? - No, no. I'll be just one minute. - Hello, Miss Ware. - Hello. - Gee, it sure is a beautiful day, isn't it? - Yes, it certainly is. Yes, it's really beautiful outside. Thank you, Walter. You can have those bonds ready for me to sign when I come back. And, oh, yes, when Senator Gage gets here, have him wait for me, will you? I'll return shortly. Put it in the barouche there. You and Buck Ware's daughter? What's the big... Pipe down, Pop. This is a break for me. Thank you, Mr. Corbett. - This has been very kind of you. - Think nothing of it, Miss Ware. The first rule of our bank is to satisfy the customer. - You told him where I'm going? - No, but I will. - Cabby, the Olympic Club. - The Olympic Club. - Dennis, will you take this bag, please? - Surely. That's all right, Miss Ware. I'll carry it in. No bother at all. It's part of my duty. Sure, Dennis, but you've got a lot to do. Suppose you got held up? Well, frankly, I'm not quite sure I haven't been. Oh, will you excuse me while I take care of the fare? Say, Pop, lend me $1, will you? I'm broke. - Oh, sure. - Thanks. Keep the change. Of all the nerve, borrowing money from you. Well, why shouldn't he? He's me own son. Say, you could put half of San Francisco in this club. - Oh, this is just the foyer, Mr. Corbett. - Yeah? One of the members who passed away, huh? Oh, no. That's a very famous statue by Douglas Tilden. - The Fallen Boxer. - Tilden? - What was he, a middleweight? - I think Mr. Tilden was the sculptor. - Boy. - Yes, Miss Ware? You may take this bag to my father in the card room. No, don't worry, Miss Ware. I'll take care of this, son. I want to deliver it in person. Which way do I go? The card room's at the far end of the hall. All right. Don't go away now. If I get lost, I'll send up a rocket. It wouldn't surprise me. A fine bunch of wolves. Won't even take a man's bank check. No, but we'll take his bank if we get the chance. How do we know your check is any good? One day you're flush, next day you're broke. Say, any time you boys think you're smart enough to break me, I'll quit the mining business. Here you are, Mr. Ware. Sure hope we brought enough. It was a little too heavy for your daughter to carry. Oh. Thank you, darling. - You're from the bank, young man? - Yes, sir. - Thanks for coming over. - Oh, not at all. Yeah. Maybe he better stick around. You're likely to need him again. My name's Corbett, sir. - How many? - Three, please. - I beg your pardon? - I said my name's Corbett, sir. I only know these gentlemen by reputation, but... Well, you are very lucky. Have a good day, Mr. Corbett. Much obliged for your service. - I'll open for 20. - Raise you 10. Two pair is no good in this game of cutthroats. - I'm in. - I will come in and raise. Now, don't be frightened, I have plenty of money now. Sorry to keep you waiting, Miss Ware, I had to be introduced to the gentlemen. Swell bunch of fellows. Swell. Hello, darling. My, you look beautiful. Thank you, dear. I wish I could return the compliment. - How's the hangover? - Heavens, does it still show? Oh, excuse me, Carlton, this is Mr. Corbett, Mr. Dewitt. - How do you do? - How are you? Mr. Corbett very kindly came back with me from the bank, and now I'm showing him the Club. I'd like to show you around myself, if I may. Oh, no, thanks. Don't bother. Miss Ware is doing fine. Well, I must be getting back to the office. See you tonight, Vicki. It's been a pleasure meeting you, Mr. Carbon. Thanks. Corbett's the name. - Oh, I beg your pardon. - Oh, that's all right. - Well, goodbye, anyway. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. - Goodbye, darling. Swell guy. You engaged to him? Well, practically. How did you guess? I heard you call him "darling. " People don't throw those darlings around unless they mean something. You're very observant, Mr. Corbett. And now I'll show you the dining room and the terrace, and you can say you've seen the Olympic Club. - Fine. Oh, did you say the dining room? - Yes. Gee whiz. You know, Miss Ware, I'd give 10 years of my life to belong to a club like this. - Why? - Oh, I don't know. It's just one of those hunches a guy has, you know? You've got to have something, that's all there is to it. I wish I wanted something as much as that. - What do you want? - Nothing. - Nothing? - Not a thing. But, well, how about that guy you're engaged to? The good-looking fellow? Don't you want him? Yes, I suppose I do. But there's never been anything I had to have. I've never sat on the edge of a chair like you're sitting now. Well, I suppose that comes from having had everything. No, I don't think that's it. You see, I was born in Virginia City, Nevada, - and played on a slag heap until I was 10. - You did? My father was a silver miner, a grubstaker on the Comstock Lode. - A grubstaker? You don't say. - I can see he was like you once. He wanted something else, and he had to have it. I suppose the Comstock and the racehorses took all the desire he had in him and there was none left over for me. Oh, I wouldn't say that, Miss Ware. Good heavens, how did we get to talking so seriously? - Mr. Corbett, do you know what time it is? - No, 1:00? - It's 1:45. - No fooling? Is it? I heard you tell your assistant you expected Senator Gage. - Thanks. Who? - Senator Gage. Senator... Senator... - Oh, you mean Senator Gage? - Yes. Oh, he can wait. I guess we better hurry anyway, though. I haven't seen the gymnasium yet. Can't go through the Olympic Club without having seen the gymnasium. Lady members aren't allowed in there. It's strictly a man's world. Oh, don't worry about that. I'll handle that. May I have the check, please? Let me take care of that, Miss Ware. - Oh, no, Mr. Corbett, you're my guest. - Well, thanks. I'll take care of the tip. - Say, got change for 20? - I'm sorry, sir, I don't. No? Well, I'll take care of you some other time. My name's Corbett. Thank you, sir. - Ready, Miss Ware? - Yes. Good. That's Judge Geary. Now, remember to protect yourself at all times. I'll feint, follow with a left to the stomach. - You try and block it. - All right. Go ahead. Afternoon, Judge. I'm sorry, Judge, but, well, you were off-balance anyway. Wide open for that left. Good afternoon, Victoria. - How do you do, Miss Ware? - Good afternoon. I hope you'll forgive my bursting in like this, but I was more or less shanghaied. Mr. Corbett's a very persuasive person. Oh, yes, indeed. I can testify to that. Watson, this is the chap I was telling you about. Saved my judicial skin last night. Oh, I'm pleased to meet you. Pardon the glove. Very proud to meet you, too, Mr. Watson. Heard a lot about you, sir. This is the man who taught the Prince of Wales how to box. Really? How interesting. I do a little boxing myself. Of course, just backyard stuff. Could certainly learn a lot from an expert like you though, sir. Oh, it's all a matter of practice. You got a good build for a boxer. Say, I'd sure like to put those gloves on with you for a minute. Well, then, why don't you, Corbett? - Let Watson show you that left jab of his. - Great. I'd like to see it. Always willing to learn, sir. - Oh, it's a beauty. - I'll bet it is. Hold this, will you, Miss Ware? Really, Mr. Corbett, I have an engagement and I'm late. - This will just take a moment. - What about the bank? You said... They can get along without me until I get back there. Thank you, Judge. Lace that, will you? My father's certainly gonna be proud to hear I've had the gloves on with you, Mr. Watson. Come on now, Miss Ware. No fancy knots. You've got a beau already, remember? Hold this, will you? Now, young man, I want you to put your left up like this. And I'm gonna hit you with my left. I want to see what you're gonna do. - Catch on? - All right, sir. I think so. Very good. Now, I'm gonna use what we call a one-two. And I want you to counter. - Now, watch it. - All right, sir. Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to jab you. Sorry? With a left like that? Well, young man, I see you can take care of yourself. Come on. I won't hit you very hard. In fact, I don't think I'm gonna hit you at all. Nice, straightforward chap, isn't he? Well, I wouldn't call him backward, Judge. You know, Victoria, that's very much the type of young man we've been looking for. - What for? - For our athletic memberships. They're free. Do you think he'd be interested? They're free? Yes. I'm sure he would be. Well, I've already sponsored three of them. Two baseball players and a hammer thrower. Look here, Victoria. If I could get your father to put up Mr. Corbett's name, would you be willing to sponsor him? Judge Geary, this is the most amazing thing I've ever heard of. Two hours ago, Mr. Corbett was just a bank clerk in here on an errand. And now... Well, look at him. - He seems perfectly at home, doesn't he? - At home? In six months, he'll own the Club. Then you will put him up? I don't know how else to get rid of him. Anyhow, Father Burke, you know you had us worried there for a while. You haven't been to our house for a long time. I've been kind of busy. But there isn't a home in the parish I'd sooner be invited to than the Corbett's. I never know to be sure what to expect. - But it's always a pleasant surprise. - Thank you, Father. And it's always a pleasure to have you here. But talking about surprises, where do you think our Jim had lunch today? Where, Ma? At the Olympic Club, if you please. - The Olympic Club. - Did he tell you that, Ma? Why, your Ma's telling the gospel truth. I drove him there, meself. I waited two hours for him and when he came out he had a quill toothpick. Well, after that, maybe the young gentleman won't approve of having a couple of longshoremen in the family. Oh, not at all, Harry, I enjoy the contrast. He enjoys the contrast. Now, ain't that some language and coming from him that used to spell bird with a "U." - Who spelled bird with... - That's the hotsie-tootsie. Well, so long as you folks appreciate me so much, I'm now gonna give you a real piece of news. Ladies and gentlemen, you're looking at the new athletic member of the Olympic Club, sponsored by none other than Mr. Henry Ware and his daughter, Victoria, of the same name. - Well, glory be... - You're kidding, Jim. I'm not, Pop. I've got the card here. I had it all fixed up today. Look. - Look at that. - Congratulations, Jim. It's a fine club, and it's quite an honor for a south-side boy to be a member. That it is. You know, ever since Jim was that high, he's been trying to improve himself, one way or another. And if you two lads had followed his example, you wouldn't be pushing a truck up a gangplank all day long. Well, Pop's at it again. George, maybe you and me better go out in the barn - and eat with the horses, eh? - It's them high collars, Harry. Them elegant, high collars. Them lovely, high collars. Cut it out, will you, fellas? You'll have to excuse them, Father, they're... That's all right, Jim. We forgot you was the only gentleman in the family. Well, the least you two fellas can do is to behave like gentlemen. Particularly when Father Burke's here. - Well, it's them elegant collars. - And that lovely tie. Now, Harry, you know what happens when you fool around with my tie. If it weren't for the fact that I'm a gentleman and Father Burke is here, I'd take you outside and teach you a lesson in manners. Oh, I get you. Well, what's holding you? Come on, come on. Excuse us, Father Burke. I'll be back in a minute. Well, which one of you are gonna be first this time? You can take me. - What is this? - Another one of them things. - Are you coming, Father? - Oh, sure, sure. You sit right down in that chair. A fight is no place for a lady. But, Ma, I missed the last one. The Corbetts are at it again! - Good morning, good morning. - Good morning. Any mail for me? - What's the name, please? - Corbett. James J. Corbett. - I'm a new member. - No, sir. No, sir. No? Nothing? Say, you don't happen to have a cigar, do you? - Yes, I have. - Oh, thanks very much. Listen, I'm gonna tip you off to something. What's that? - You see that statue over there? - Yeah. Well, that doesn't belong down here. Why don't you have it moved up in the gym? - Very well, we'll have it moved. - Good. There's nothing like a good smoke. - How many cigars do you smoke a day? - Oh, any given number. - See you later. - Paging Mr. Crocker... Hey, kid. Listen, I'm a new member. James J. Corbett. I'll be in the card room. - Have me paged there, will you? - All right, sir. Paging Mr. Corbett. Paging Mr. Corbett. Paging Mr. Corbett. What did I tell you? There he goes, having himself paged again. Well, boys, we might as well face it. Something's got to be done about Corbett before he drives us all crazy or somebody kills him. He doesn't really mean to be such a pain in the neck, Jerry. It's just a natural gift with him, like boxing. Why do we have to put up with a bore just to have a boxer? Confound it, this is a social club. Let him take his biceps somewhere else. Corbett's a type. And you can't take offense at a type, it's no use. The offensiveness isn't really individual. Has he ever pushed you off the flying rings, just playful like? Or tickle you when you're on the parallel bars, just to see what would happen? If there was only some way we could pin his ears back and put him in his place. Paging Mr. Corbett. Paging Mr. Corbett. Paging Mr. Corbett. Rest. Hands on chest. Place. Forward. Back. Forward. Back. Forward. Rest. Hands on hips. Half bend slowly. Down, up, down, up, down. Rest. And this exercise, gentlemen, is for reducing the waistline. Hands over the head. Slowly bending, touching the floor. Down. Lower, gentlemen, lower. Touch the floor, Mr. Huntington. Touch the floor. Slowly rising. Up. Up. That will be all, gentlemen. Relax. Hello, Jack. Well, I'm glad to see they got you fixed up. Gentlemen, I want you to meet an old friend of mine, the one and only Jack Burke. Former heavyweight champion of the British Isles and Australia. - How do you do, Mr. Burke? - How do you do? He just got off the boat this morning so I asked him to drop in and work out the kinks. Well, I'm glad you did, Watson. - How long you staying in town, Mr. Burke? - Oh, I don't know, sir. Ten days, perhaps a fortnight. I'm fighting Jake Kilrain in Chicago on the 25th. Would you be willing to put on a little contest for us? - We'd see you were very well paid for it. - But I have to be in Chicago. You'd be doing the Club a great personal favor, Mr. Burke. Yes, indeed. Now why don't you stay over and we'll pay you, say, $1,000? - $1,000? How much is that? 200 guineas? - That's right. Would that satisfy you? Not only satisfies me, gents, but I'll satisfy you as well. I get it, you wanna give somebody a good drubbing, is that it? As you say, Mr. Burke. That is it. Paging Mr. Corbett. Paging Mr. Corbett. Paging Mr. Corbett. Paging Mr. Corbett. Look at you. Well, I can't believe me eyes. How do you like it? How does it fit? How do I look, huh? Just like you were melted and poured into it. Anyone that says it ain't yours is a liar. - Look at this, Pa. Five bucks extra. - $5. - You gonna fight in those clothes? - No, Mary. Well, George, what about it? You look just like one of Pop's $500 funerals. That's a fine thing to say, and him off to fight the ex-champion of England. Well, why don't you say something, Pop! Jim, me boy, you've set the Corbetts ahead 1,000 years. I'll go get the barouche. She's all polished. - All right. - Oh, Jim, you're the handsomest man of south San Francisco. - Oh, now, Mary. - I'm afraid Ma was right. We have got one gentleman in family. Yeah, but don't be too much of a one. I got 20 bucks bet on you. - Don't worry, boys. So long, Harry. - Good luck, Jim. - So long, George. - We'll be waiting up for you. Goodbye, kid. Goodbye, Ma. Jim, don't let him hurt you. Don't worry, Ma. He won't even lay a glove on me. - Oh, say, Ma. Look, how about this flower? - Beautiful. - Yeah, but is it big enough? - Sure. Okay, goodbye. Careful of that suit, you know it's rented! Hey, Walter, hang on to this, will you? It belongs to Harry. - Hello, Mr. Dewitt. - Hiya, Corbett. Miss Ware, Mr. Ware. How are you, Judge? - Good luck. - Hello, Mr. Huntington. - Good luck, Jim. Remember that left. - All right, Father. Well, here I go. Take the show away from him, darling. Tell him you'll fight the winner. Hello, Jim! There he is. That's him. That's my boy. Ladies and gentlemen, we now have the pleasure of witnessing a 10 - round, or perhaps shorter, exhibition of the scientific art of self - defense between Mr. Jack Burke, former heavyweight champion of England and Mr. James J. Corbett of the Olympic Club. Hello, Jim. There he is. It may be of interest for you to know that for the first time in America this contest will governed by the new Marquess of Queensberry rules. The rounds will be of three minutes duration, with one minute's rest. A round will not end by a knockdown. The man on the floor will have 10 seconds to regain his feet or be counted out by the referee. The referee, Mr. Harry Watson. Now, gentlemen, you know the rules as we discussed them. Obey them. I want you to shake hands, go to your corner and come out fighting. Time! Time! That bloke jumps around like a jack rabbit, Birdsey. But I'll get him this round. Mommy, why doesn't Daddy look like that in his underwear? He did once. Time. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. - Well, what do you think of my protg? - Well, I put him up, didn't I? - I got him in. - Sure. Then you put up $1,000 to get him knocked out. I'll take yours. This is the easiest money I ever got! You know, Miss Ware, here's something I can't understand. What is it, Mr. Corbett? Well, how can I be dancing with you? I'm supposed to be murdered. - Feeling pretty good, aren't you? - Oh, listen, I'm feeling fine. I'm well aware of it. You have a beautiful start. Well, I figure if I can lick a former world's champion that easy, I'd ought to be able to take almost anyone. Oh, Mr. Corbett, what a beautiful swelled head you're going to have. You'll be bouncing around like a balloon. Miss Ware, you're wrong about that. You see, a swelled head is a guy who thinks he's good and isn't. - Get the difference? - Oh, I see. Besides, didn't you say just now I had a good start? I did. But I wasn't referring to your ring career, Mr. Corbett. I was talking about the champagne. If you're not used to it, it's tricky. Champagne? Tricky? Listen. I come from a long line of drinkers. I can probably drink more than anybody in the world. - Miss Ware, that's for being so right. - Thank you. - Hello. - Hello. How do you do? Well. Thank you. Pardon me. That was my drink you took. It was? Well, then, this one must be mine. - Have a drink, huh? - I've got one, thanks. And I'd like to introduce myself. I'm Jim's... I know you. You're Corbett's friend, aren't you? Friend? I've known Jim ever since we were kids. We went to school together and everything. And let me tell you there isn't a guy in Hayes Valley that Jim can't lick except maybe Joe Choynski. - Oh, really? - Did I ever tell you about the fight he had with Joe on a barge down behind Ming's Wharf? - Excuse me. - Yeah, it's okay. I'm gonna have a dance, anyway. I haven't been on the floor yet. I'll see you later. You know, I've never really thanked you for making all of this possible. If you hadn't brought me here and sort of sponsored me for membership, well, I guess I never would have seen this side of the tracks at all. But, you know, there really aren't two sides of the tracks to San Francisco. There's only the lucky and the unlucky. Those that happened to grab the right moment and those that didn't. And don't you let this Nob Hill crowd deceive you, either. After all, we all started out with the same wooden washtubs. I'd been hoping all night you'd let your hair down with me. - Why, you impertinent roughneck. - Who? Me? That was carrying your well-known nerve just a little bit too far, Mr. Corbett. Yeah, but what's the matter? I thought you wanted me to kiss you. I never said anything of the kind. Well, I know you didn't say so, but you brought me out here in the moonlight. And you told me not to be scared. What do you think I was gonna do? - Why, you... - Oh, you'll have to do better than that. I hope some man knocks your block off. Hey. Hey, Judge. You remember me, don't you? Walter Lowrie? You know, the night we got pinched at the fight and taken down to the jail? That's the funniest thing I ever saw. Him in there with all the rest of us. - Wilbur, what is he referring to? - Why, I... Oh, my dear, there's a mistake. - Young man, you're intoxicated. - Who? Me? No, sir. You remember we sat right next to each other in the patrol wagon? Wilbur, explain yourself. Hey, Judge, did I say something wrong? I guess I did. Look here, Dewitt. That friend of Corbett's is getting completely out of hand. I know. He's tight as an owl. He buttonholed me three times to describe the fight blow by blow, as if I hadn't been there. Well, now, you're the chairman of the floor committee. I think you should ask him to leave. Well, all right. But I hope he doesn't try and make a scene. He can't do much more than he did to Judge Geary. Come on. Drink up. This is good stuff, isn't it? - On the house, too. - Sure. Can I speak to you a minute? Hello, Dewitt. How are you? Say, that was a pretty good speech you made tonight. - You remember the part... - Yeah, "10 rounds or perhaps shorter. " - Will you have a drink? - No, thanks. No. - Come on. It's on the house. - It's on the house. Listen, Corbett, this is very embarrassing to me. But I'm afraid we'll have to ask your friend here to leave. - Who, me? - If you don't mind. I'm terribly sorry. Why has he got to leave? What's the matter with him? Well, among other things, he isn't in formal attire, which was obligatory tonight. Some of our ex-gold miners are very particular about form. Oh, they are, are they? - Well, he looks all right to me. - Well, this a very nice suit. It's... - Well, it's dark, anyway. - Please. Let's not have a scene. A scene? I already put on one scene for you tonight, didn't I? Can't I ask a friend in here? He's not doing any harm. Oh, no. It's all right, Jim. I'll go. Yeah. All right. Wait a minute, Walter. Well, will you answer my question, Dewitt? Can I or can't I? I'm sorry, Corbett, but this is a strict rule of the Club. - He must leave. - All right. - If he goes, I go, too. - That's entirely up to you. - I had hoped you might understand. - Understand? Sure, I understand perfectly. You mean, it's all right for me to stay here, huh? 'Cause I'm like a sort of trained seal? But now I've done my act, my friend isn't a part of the deal. - Is that it? Yeah, yeah. - Not that at all. I hear some of you gentlemen already lost $1,000 trying to put me in my place tonight. I'm sorry to disappoint you, but I sure thought you'd be better sports than to try and get back at me this way. Come on, Walter. Let's get out of here. Let's get our coats and hats first. Paging Mr. Corbett. Paging Mr. Corbett. Paging Mr. Corbett. Can I make up this room now? - Hey, Walter. - What? Where are we? I don't know. This ain't my room. It must be yours. No. It's not mine. - It looks like a hotel. - Hotel? - What would we be doing in a hotel? - Oh, I don't know. Do you know what? I think we passed out. - Yeah. - What's the last thing you remember? Well. We got kicked out of the Olympic Club. You remember that? - Yeah. - Then, we went to one, two, three bars. That's all I remember. Yes, yes, yes. Jim, we got to get going. We got to get to the bank. Yeah. Come on. Come on. Hand me my shoes, will you? Yeah. - You got it? - Yeah. No, that's not it. - Here. - Thanks. - Hey. - What? - What were we doing on a train? - Train? - You must have been dreaming. - I guess so. I wonder what part of town we're in. Hey... Jim, come here. If this is San Francisco, it's a part of town I never saw before. - Look. - What? That big sign. Salt Lake Ice Company. Salt Lake City. Well, it can't be. That's way back east somewhere. Salt Lake City. - That's where the Mormons come from. - How did we ever get here? - I don't know. - How much money you got? I'm broke. Thirty-five cents. Gee. What's the bank gonna do for tellers? What're the tellers gonna do for a bank? Hiya, Corbett. Well, here's your 10 bucks. Everything is all set, and Miller is raring to go. - My 10 bucks? - Sure, you said you'd fight him for 10 bucks. In fact, last night, you said you'd fight him for five. But Miller's a little tough, so I've decided to give you 10. Miller? Who's Miller? - Who's Miller? - He's a big, local pug. He'd make two of you. Say, - you are a fighter, ain't you? - Sure. Sure, I am, but... But what? Oh, I see. Not enough dough, huh? All right, I'll get somebody else. Not smart, that's me. I pick drunks out of a saloon. He tells me he just knocked out the champion of England. Why, I ought to know better. Give me my... Hey, wait a minute. Wait a minute. Let's get this thing straight. Oh, I'm a little dizzy, you know, it seems that last night I was... A little, you know... Yeah. You were a little more than "you know" last night. You were soused. What a bun! Well, we... Yeah, we had a little wine. But where do I fight and when? Well, now that sounds a little better. Now, here's the setup. It's a six-fight card. All boys here from Salt Lake City. All good boys, I know them all. - Well, in a private club or what? - What do you mean, a private club? I'm Billy Delaney. None of that small stuff for me. I'm strictly big time. No amateur smokers for me. I'll see you later tonight, boys. Delaney's Bar over on Tucker road. And be there early, will you? - Sure. - So long, champ. So long. - Do you wanna fight, too? - No, I just wanna get my job back. Oh, the door. Jim, you can't fight. You're not in any condition to fight. - You must feel as bad as I do. - I feel just as bad as you do. But I've got to fight. I took the guy's money. - We've gotta get home. - Yeah. Anyway, I can probably lick the guy. - Yeah, but you're not a professional. - Professional? Professional. Some of those boys do all right. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, - 6... - I don't blame you, gents. I ought to beg your pardon for even bringing in such a ham-and-egger. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. Jim, you won. You won, you hear me? You won. Great, kid, great. What a comeback. What you need is a good manager, a smart guy to bring you along. I ain't seen nobody hit like that but John L. Sullivan. I can lick any man in the world. Mike, drinks for everybody in the house. Tonight the Palace Bar is taken over by John L. Sullivan himself. And I want to shake the hand of every one of you. - Glad to meet you, champ. - I'm glad to meet you, sir. - I saw you fight Kilrain. - Kilrain's a great fighter, a great man. Come on now, boys. Come on, the drinks are all on me. Get up there. Well, I'd be in Ireland a long time before ever this'd happen to me. What's that, sir? Meeting and shaking hands with John L. Sullivan himself. - Oh, well, that's fine, sir. That's fine. - You know, I have a boy who's a fighter, too. Oh, well, I'd like to meet him sometime, sir. Come on now, boys. Come on, come on. I can lick any man in the world. "Choynski," he says. "Who's Choynski?" I asked. "My kid brother Jim can beat him. " You know what he said? What? Said you were a lucky kid. Never met anybody but third-raters. "Yeah?" I said. "What about Patty Ryan? "What about Butch Kruger? Who knocked them out?" "Well, who ain't?" he goes on. George, hold your tongue and leave Jim alone. He's got another fine job, and he's through with fighting. Ma, let him have one more. Let him meet Choynski. - Yes, Ma, why don't you? - Hello, here comes Pop. Oh, he's walking that tightrope again. Whoa, Pop, take off your skates. - Hello, Pop. - Hi, Pop. I don't know that I should associate with anybody here - after what happened to me today. - What happened? - What did you do, Pop? - What's the matter with your hand? - Do you see that hand? - Yes, yeah. - Do you see it? - What about it? Well, you're gazing on the hand that shook the hand of John L. Sullivan. - John L. Sullivan. - John L. Sullivan. - John Sullivan. - John L. Sullivan. John L. Sullivan himself. Here it is. Well, what are you planning on doing with it? I'm not even gonna wash it. Look out. Look out. He'll hit you with his right. Hello, Miss Ware. Hello, Mr. Dewitt. Well, Corbett, we haven't seen you since the evening of your... - your celebration. - Yeah, that's right. Why, no, I dropped into the bank a few days later, and they hadn't seen you, either. Oh, yes, yes. I resigned. Took a little trip. - Really? Where did you go? - Salt Lake City. Salt Lake? Whatever did you go there for? Oh, I wanted to see the lake. Oh, excuse me. - Boy, that's the one that did it. - Hello, John. - How are you? I'm glad to see you. - Good heavens. Now, there's something that you can tell your kids, lady. You've felt the arm what shook the world. And the hand. She'll probably ask him for an autographed picture. Possibly, she's the most unpredictable young lady. Good night, miss. Where's my cab, boys? Gentlemen, my life is complete. I just felt the arm what shook the world. What shook the world? Oh, Corbett, we were looking for a place to have a little snack. - Would you care to join us? - No, thanks. No, no. Oh, come on. Come and see the show! Sullivan the Great. That was certainly a pretty sight, Miss Ware. You poring over Sullivan like that. Why, you ought to be ashamed of yourself. Carlton, what's he talking about? Yeah, what are you driving at, Corbett? Well, you ought to be ashamed of yourself, too, for allowing it. - She's your girl, isn't she? - How dare you? - Have you any idea who you're talking to? - Well, I know I'm not talking to my girl. You know what I'd do with you if you were my girl? I'd just put you right over my knee and give you a good spanking. - What do you think of that? - Your girl? Being your girl is so far beyond my imagination... Look, Miss Ware, let me tell you something. When a girl loses her dignity, she loses something important. She loses class. And feeling that big lug's arm like that, why, that's hero worship stuff... Look who he's calling a big lug. John L. Sullivan. Now, come on. Let's stop fighting about nothing. Come on. Oh, be quiet, Carlton. You ought to knock his block off. Oh, don't do that, Dewitt. I gotta fight Choynski next week. - Are you gonna fight Choynski? - Yeah. Oh, please, Mr. Corbett. Fight Choynski. It's just what you need. That's the girl. You just keep pulling for me to lose, will you? That's the way I like it. Brings me good luck. Come on, Carlton. Good night, Mr. Corbett. Good night. Thanks for the snack. Be sure you get all these things in, now. - Did you put in some sticking plaster? - Don't forget the shoes. - And the towels. - The best ones. - And look, there's his tights. - Oh, they're pretty. Just like an acrobat's. Look at these things. They look like a couple of boiled lobsters. Bare knuckles is the way to fight, I say. Don't you know it's bad luck to wear your hats in the house? Where is the lad? Hey, Jim! Stop brushing your hair and get started. Choynski'll think you ain't gonna show up. - If I had my way, he wouldn't show up. - Oh, now, Ma. Don't start that again. I'll speak my mind. It's like throwing a lamb to a wolf. - Oh, here he is. - How are you, Jim? I got everything in the bag here. - All right. - Come on, Jim. Let's go. You go ahead. I'll be right with you. - Now what? - Oh, go ahead. Now, Ma. Is that a nice way to act? Why, if I knew you were at home crying here, I couldn't win the fight. I can't help it, Jim. I know no good will come of it. - And you'll get hurt. - I won't get hurt. Why, he won't even touch me. And do you know what I'm gonna do with the prize money? The first thing, I'm gonna buy you the most beautiful sealskin coat you ever saw in your life. Will you like that? Come on, give me a smile now. A nice big smile. Bigger. Bigger. Bigger. That's the girl. Come on, Jim. You gonna wait all night? Yeah. Hurry it up, Jim. What time you think it is? Come on. Hurry up. I'll be back in an hour. Now, no more crying. Goodbye. - Jim. - Yes, Mom? Do you think I'll look good in a sealskin coat? Like a queen, Ma. Like a queen. Hey, Jim. Come on, we'll be late. - Hello, Judge. - Oh, good luck. Mr. Huntington, Miss Ware. You all know my friend Walter Lowrie, don't you? - Well, you bet I do. Very well. - You ought to, Judge. Well, Miss Ware, if I get knocked out, I hope you throw a little water on me. When you get knocked out, Mr. Corbett, I'll throw some champagne on you. Well, make sure it's good champagne. - Hello, Dewitt. - Best of luck, Corbett. - Nice to have seen you. - This is going to be sad. Corbett is a lamb being led to the slaughter. Well, he needs some of that conceit knocked out of him. So you showed up, huh? Hey, Pop, come here. Bet this for me, will you? - What? Shall I bet the watch, too? - Sure, bet it all. - Hello, Father. - Jim, you're fighting a good lad. - Now, watch your left. Good luck to you. - I know. All right, I will. - Knock him flat, Jim. - Okay. - Good luck, Jim. - All right, George. - Hey, you've got my good tie on, Harry. - I'll take care of it. Well, mind you do. Who's got all that Choynski money? - Hey, the gloves ain't here. - Shut up. Here, put these on. Come on. Get them on! - Hey, what is this? - You'll cut him to ribbons with these. All right. Come on. Shake hands. Hey, what's the idea, Choynski? Where's your boxing gloves? He lost them. That's what he did. He lost them. Yeah? Well, he can't fight with those. Aw, nix on that. We won't fight you without regulation gloves. Wait a minute. Wait a minute, Billy. He can use gloves, no gloves, bare knuckles. He can use a baseball bat if he wants. Let's get started. I'm sheriff of this county, and I'm stopping this fight. - He should've been a dancer. - Yes. Attaboy, Jim. You'll knock him flat, there. Hey! Don't muss my hair up. Listen, Tony, the guy's a dancing master. He'll dance himself out in a couple rounds. Just keep chopping with that left. When he opens up, lower the boon with that right. You know what to do when you're in there, sweetheart. Now, keep away from him, Jimmy. He's pretty smart. Yeah. - But I know something he doesn't know. - What's that? How hard he hit me with that right. Look out, Jim. - Come on. - Give it to him, Joe. Give it to him. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. 1, 2... - Will he get up? Will he get up? - How do I know? ...3, 4... - But you're his manager, ain't you? ...5, 6. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. Jimmy! Get up! 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. Hey, wait a minute. You can't go in there. I want to see that he gets a fair deal. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. 1, 2, 3, 4. Springtime's over. Take it easy. Come on, don't get excited. The Olympic Club bunch are betting against me, aren't they? - Just about $15,000 worth. - That's good. You're boxing pretty, Jim. Just dance away from him. - And stick that left in his face. - All right. All right. Get in there. You're all wet, Mr. Corbett. - Throw him a rope. Throw him a rope. - Don't worry about a rope. He can swim. Paging Mr. Corbett. Paging Mr. Corbett. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. Mrs. Corbett. Mrs. Corbett. Jim won. Jim won, Mrs. Corbett. Jim won! He knocked him out. He won. Here he comes now. Come on, Jim. - Hello, Ma. - Are you all right, Son? Oh, sure. Sure. He never even touched me. Ma, you should've been there. Jim knocked him as cold as a cucumber. And Choynski was tough, Ma. Aw, Choynski couldn't punch a hole in a pound of butter. - He knocked Jim out of the ring. - Jim slipped. I never saw such a fight, Mrs. Corbett, in all me days. Everything happened but a fire and a flood. Yeah, Ma. And because Jim won tonight, they want him to fight Jake Kilrain in New Orleans, six rounds for $2,500. What do you think of that? - And who is Kilrain? - Who's Kilrain? Shut up. It's a great mistake for him to meet Kilrain. Kilrain's twice his size and a terror. - I saw him fight Sullivan. - He's right, Jim. You're not ready for him yet. He's a tough man and a bruiser. - But, Pa, I may be able to wear him down. - What do you mean, wear him down? Why, if Kilrain ever caught up to you, he'd knock you so cold we'd have to thaw you out. That's a fine way to talk about your own brother. - Why, for two cents I'd... - Take it easy. - Here, cut that out. - Jim! Where's your new suit? Well, Ma, I didn't have time to... Harry, what have you done with my tie? - Somebody must have copped it. - Copped it? Pop, he says they copped it. My best tie... Quit squawking about a two-bit tie, will you? A two-bit tie? I'll take... Mother, he's got no right to touch my ties. Come on and we'll have a cup of tea. The way he carries on, you'd think I'd lost a diamond ring. You ain't even bright enough to hold onto a tie, let alone a diamond. - Shut up, you, or I'll tie you in a knot. - Yeah? - You and who else? - Do you hear? Into the barn! Into the barn! Get in there! Come on! The Corbetts are at it again. - Is this seat taken? - No, ma'am. - Would you care to sit by the window? - No, thank you. - You're a gentleman, sir. - Thank you, ma'am. And a scholar. - I said you're welcome. - Oh. Are you going all the way to New Orleans? - Yes, ma'am. - First time? First time, ma'am. - How long do you expect to stay? - Oh, about six rounds. In Milwaukee, Corbett took this Ed Kinney in four rounds, see? Well, Corbett's all right in the sticks, but wait till he meets Charlie Mitchell, yeah. Thanks, gents. What do you think of Corbett now? A lucky guy. Why do people pay good money to see him as an actor? Come on, folks. - Father Burke. - Good luck to you, Pat. Thank you, Father. Don't close that door, Mary, it's bad luck. - Oh, Ma, don't be so superstitious. - I'm not superstitious. But I'm taking no chances. Goodbye. Goodbye, Kate. - Goodbye, Molly. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. - Goodbye, Mary. Be a good girl. Come on, Ma. Give me the lamp. Get in now and hurry it up, or I'll give the lamp to the lady standing here. Give me the bird cage. What're you dragging this thing around for? The bird died five years ago. - Here, take this. - Oh, stop crying, Ma. - Take this. - You should be glad - to be moving to Nob Hill. - You'll be living amongst the big bugs. Goodbye, Nora. We'll be up to see you as soon as you get settled. Don't bring your old man if he ain't sober. Well, don't bring him if he is. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. Goodbye. Ain't it strange and wonderful, Father, how the right hand of God - reaches down to help the poor? - Yes, Mrs. Casey. But this time he had the help of a very good left. Quiet! Quiet! Quiet! Quiet, the lot of you! Quiet! The drinks are on my boy, Jim. He gave his family a beautiful home on Nob Hill. He gave his mother a beautiful sealskin coat, too. And he bought this saloon for his two brothers. And he sends his best regards to the lot of you from New York. And what's more, he can lick any man in the world. And we're not even excluding... - John. - L. Sullivan. Boy, can that Sullivan swing an ax. Look at those chips fly. Hey, Jim, in your show you ought to saw a tree in two. Shut up, will you? He's terrible. Besides, the log was practically chopped when the curtain went up. What a ham, acting with an ax. He probably has to chop wood because he can't remember lines. Well, he's still the champ, Jim. You can't take that away from him. Yeah, what a ham. - Yeah. - What a ham. What a ham. Say, John, who do you think's sitting out there, in a box with his manager? How should I know? One of my challengers, I suppose. I'm gonna have to begin to wade through the tramps, I guess. This is no tramp, John. This is James J. Corbett himself. Corbett himself. Corbett himself? Where do you get the "Corbett himself" stuff? Well, at least he's proved he's one of the best contenders. Look at that 61-round draw with Peter Jackson. Peter Jackson. Do you mean Peter Jackson himself? Do you mean Charlie Mitchell himself? Say, there's only one man in the world you can call himself, - and that's the champion himself. - Yeah, that's right, John. - Come in. - Mr. Sullivan, Mr. James J. Corbett. - Mr. Sullivan. - Mr. James J. Corbett himself. Well, I'm glad to meet Mr. Corbett himself. And it's a pleasure to meet you, sir. - Quite a grip you have there. - Sit down. Sit down, Mr. Corbett. - Thank you very much. - Have a drink. Have a drink. No, thanks. I'm on the wagon. You don't tell me. On the wagon, is it? On the wagon itself! Well, I've been a long time trying to meet you, Mr. Sullivan. I've seen you around San Francisco a few times but from a long distance, of course. Well, seeing me from a long distance is a smart idea, young fella. What is all this nonsense about you wanting to meet me in the ring? Peter Jackson thought it was a lot of nonsense, too. A little salt, please, Mr. Sullivan. - Right. - Thank you. How long was it you stayed with Jackson, 16 rounds? Now, Mr. Sullivan, you know better than that. Why don't you just turn those figures around? It was 61 rounds. How long do you think Jackson would stay with me? Sixty-one seconds, sir. Well, that must explain why you've been ducking him all this time, I suppose. Too easy, huh? Duck? Did you say duck? I'll meet any man who will stand on his own two feet, and if you had about 30 pounds more on you, you'd be the first one, sir. I'll return the compliment, Mr. Sullivan. If you'd fight me, I'd just wish you were five years younger. What do you mean by that? Not much fun winning the championship from a guy who's practically tripping over his beard. Beard, is it? Who's got a beard? Why, you fresh brat, who do you think you're talking to? John L. Sullivan himself. I'll have you know that I can lick any man in the world. All except one, Mr. Sullivan. All except one. - Is that so? - John. - Why, you... - Your steak is getting cold. - I don't care. Get him out of here. - Come on, Jim. Don't give it away. Get him out of here before I murder him. Call the newspaper boys in. I'll fight that blabbermouth anytime, anywhere. Nobody can talk like that to me. I don't care... Get him out of here. Yeah, get him out of here. - Who does he think he is? - Oh, what's the matter with you? Why, the man is insane. I'm the champion of the world, I'll have you know. - I know, John. But eat your steak. - I'll eat my steak... Did you hear what he said, Billy? He's gonna fight me. - Yeah, how'd you do it, Jim? - How'd you ever get him so mad? I just told him a few things and got his goat. Hey, we're gonna fight Sullivan. Boy, did he fall for it. Listen to this: "I hereby accept the challenge of James J. Corbett "to fight me the first week of September this year, 1892, "at New Orleans, Louisiana, for a purse of $25,000, - "winner take all. " - $25,000. Do you know what I think I'll do, Billy? I'm gonna buy myself a theater and play Hamlet. Hamlet? Yeah. "Furthermore, I insist upon a side bet of $10,000 to make certain - "that Corbett will show up for the fight. " - Show up? I'll be there before and after that big windbag. Yeah, I know that, but where are we going to get $10,000? Hey, what about borrowing back some of that dough you sent your family, huh? Oh, no. I'd never do that, Billy. I gave it to them. All right. Then why fool ourselves? Jim, at your weight, there ain't a man in the country that'll risk one dime on you against Sullivan. - Would you? - Well, that ain't hardly a fair question, Jim. All right, Billy. But I'll tell you this. We haven't come this far together to miss the big chance just for the sake of a few thousand bucks. I'll get it somehow. Well, that kind of dough don't grow on trees, Jim. - I know it, but I'll get it somehow. - All right. But look, I'll run rings around the guy. I'll tie him up in knots. - Oh, it's only $10,000. - I'm sorry, Jim, but this is final. No. Well, you're missing a good chance. Thanks anyway, Charlie. - Paging Mr. Corbett. Paging Mr. Corbett. - Yes? Senator Gage would like to speak to you, sir. Senator Gage? Oh, is it... What do you mean Senator Gage? - Vicki! Oh, I'm so glad to see you. - Hello, Mr. Corbett. Why, I'm so glad to see you, I'm surprised. How are you? - I'm fine. My, you're looking well. - Oh, thanks. I can't get over how glad I am to see you. Look, I want to talk to you. - Where shall we go? What'll we do? - Well, let's sit over here. - But I only have a minute. - Oh, have you gotta go somewhere? Yes, I have to go upstairs and change for dinner. - Oh. - Well, what have you been doing lately? Oh, I've... What have I been doing? Why, haven't you heard? Oh, yes, of course, I beg your pardon. How long have you been in New York? Oh, I'll tell you about that. Look, why don't you run upstairs and get changed, and then let me take you out to dinner? Oh, there's a new play opening at the Empire. - Would you like to go? - Oh, I'm going there with the Belmonts. - Sorry. - Oh. - Well, let's have dinner first. - No, I'm dining at Delmonico's. Oh, I see. You're all tied up, huh? - Well, how about lunch tomorrow? - Sorry. - Well, dinner tomorrow night. - Sorry. Are you gonna be sorry all day Wednesday? My dear Mr. Corbett, I'm engaged for the next three weeks. - Every single moment. - Three weeks. Oh, that's too bad. It's nice to have seen you again, but I really must go. I have to dress for dinner. How long did you say you've been in New York? Couple of weeks. Why? That's good. You'd better not stick around much longer. - It doesn't agree with you. - What are you talking about? Why, you've got about the best case I've seen in a long time of social butterfly itch. You've got the jumps. That's what's the matter with you. "I'm so sorry, Mr. Corbett, but I'm busy for the next three weeks. " That's marvelous. When I said I was glad to see you, I must have been crazy. - Mr. Corbett. - Yes? What amuses me, what really amuses me is how you could think I'd go anywhere with you, - even if I were marooned. - Oh, is that so? Well, if it's famous people that's swelling that lovely, dumb, blonde head of yours, let me tell you when I take a girl out, she really gets to see something. I stop the traffic in San Francisco, anyway. Oh, listen to who's famous. Just because you're a two-bit prize fighter, you... A two-bit prize fighter? Listen, if you ever get to doing as well socially as I do prize fighting, you'll do all right, kiddo. One of these days, you can tell your friends you nearly went out on a date with Jim Corbett. Well, I see you two have picked up the conversation right where you left off. - Hello, Mr. Ware. - How are you, Jim? Fine, thanks. It's good to see you. Dad, it's unbelievable. It's a study of a bank clerk gone crazy. You'd better get her out of New York, Mr. Ware. - Better get her back to that nice Dewitt. - I can't. They've had a fight, too. No kidding? I didn't know he had that much sense. Why, you glorified pug, you. Well, I'm blamed, if I ever saw anything like you two. If you don't like each other, why in Sam Hill do you have to make so much noise about it? Dad, get this gentleman, this gentleman Jim Corbett. He actually asked me to go to the opening with him tonight. - This tinhorn, shanty Irishman. - Well, who isn't? Only difference is we've got a bigger shanty. Of course she doesn't like famous people, Mr. Ware, not much. Remember the time you felt Sullivan's arm like this? You got a kick out of that, didn't you? "Gentleman Jim. " I never really saw the joke until now. Well, I never saw anything get her so upset before. Yeah. Tinhorn Irishman. Oh, by the way, you don't happen to have $10,000 you could lend me, do you? - Ten... What for? - Sullivan's side bet, you know? Oh, Jim, I'm sorry. I'm a gambler, but I've got to have some run for my money. I guess so. Say, maybe Vicki'll dig it up for you. Yeah. I got a picture of that. Well, it's good to see you. - You two are the funniest couple. - Yeah. Well, so long. What'll happen if they can't raise the side bet? Oh, they'll just call the fight off. Nearly everybody's given it up now anyhow. You know, Dad, it's a great pity that Mr. Corbett has to miss such good shellacking. I feel very cheated. Do you really dislike him so much? What does he do now? What is it? I get furious every time I think about him. Then why do you think about him at all? I can't help it. I keep running into him everywhere I go. Every time I pick up a newspaper, there's a picture of him, smirking like a tomcat. Every time I turn a corner, there's a big poster of him. I'd give anything in the world to see him just once flat on his back with all that ego knocked out of him. Well, you won't see Sullivan do it unless Jim and Delaney can dig up an angel somewhere, an angel who doesn't mind being clipped. Oh, how do you do, Miss Ware? I got your note and came right over to see you. Thank you, Mr. Delaney. Well, you can just call me Billy, if you don't mind. All right, Billy. How have you been? - I've got a fine load of troubles, thank you. - Yes, I heard about that. It's a shame. Can you beat that for hard luck? I wanna tell you, Miss Ware, that Jim and I are so worried we can't sleep. We can't hardly eat. Why, he's down to 165 pounds, practically a bantam weight. Really? He seemed very fresh and cocky this afternoon. Oh, don't let that fool you, ma'am. He's just acting. I tell you, all he does is sit in his room all day and all night, just eating his heart out because he can't get some backer with $10,000. - Mr. Delaney? - Yes, ma'am? If I loaned you the money, will you give me your word of honor never to tell Corbett where it came from? You ain't just kidding me? No, I happen to have a personal reason for wanting to see the fight. Oh, I get it. You want to get in on some of that 8-to-1 Sullivan dough, huh? And clean up. Why, you'll make a killing. No, I don't want it to go quite that far. - Just far enough to enjoy. - I see. Now, promise me you'll never tell him, ever. Not a word, not a word, ma'am, I promise you. I knew there'd be somebody from San Francisco who wouldn't let us down. Thanks, miss. Thanks, you're a darling. Why, Vicki, isn't that Anna Held? Isn't she lovely? She always has the most handsome men with her. May I borrow your glasses a minute, dear? Oh, I beg your pardon. I want to see if that really is a Greek god with her, or just an old woman's mirage. I guess it's true what they're saying about those two. What? That she put up the $10,000 for Corbett to meet Sullivan. Ten John L's. I'll give you six Corbetts for one. What do you take me for? That hot sun out there ain't gonna do Sullivan no good. But that's what he likes, parades, noise, hand-shaking. But I know how to take care of a fighter. Now, look at this place, - nice, quiet and peaceful. - Yeah, just like a museum. Quiet. Beautiful. You know, Billy, this guy, Shakespeare, really knew his drama. I think I'm gonna play this instead of Lily, The Mad Duchess. Watch the way the guy comes in. - Watch this, Billy. - We're watching, Jim. Yeah. Yeah. You see? Hey, he's been out in the garden. See? - Now he comes in, watch this. - All right. Hark... Sit down and play us a tune. - Oh, not now, Pa. - Oh, yeah, Mary. Come on. Come on, play. Why am I paying for all these lessons if you won't play? - Pat, sing us a song. - That I will. Line up. Mary. I hope you break a leg. Oh, look at those maniacs! Quiet! Quiet! Quiet! What do you mean barging in here like a herd of wild elephants? Did you call me an elephant? Will you shut up? Pat, I'm sure that Mr. Delaney meant no harm. Thank you, Mrs. Corbett. I did mean no harm. - We'll have none of that. - Oh, shut up! - The Corbetts are at it again. - Stand aside! - Stand aside! - I hope they kill each other. I think you gentlemen are in the wrong seats. Go on. You belong on the other side. - Boys! - You belong on the other side. Get out of there. What do you think of them guys? I'd like to... Has anybody got any Sullivan money? Now, don't get excited, Jim. Don't let it rattle you. Who's excited? Look, he's gonna shake my arm off. - Here, you do it, Walter. - I can't, Jim. I couldn't even button my vest this morning. - Well, how am I gonna... - Come on, Corbett, hurry up. The referee's in the ring and Sullivan's waiting to follow you in. - Hey, wait a minute, Donovan. - Well, what now? You say Sullivan's waiting for me to go into the ring first? - Of course! - What do you mean "of course"? Because John L. Sullivan, the champion of the world, is a very superstitious man. And he's famous enough to rate that privilege. Oh, well. Oh, I don't expect any privileges. But I think I ought to get an even break. Maybe I'm superstitious. - Well, of all the brass. - What are you trying to pull, Corbett? - What are you trying to pull? - Who do you think you are? - Who do you think he is? - Throw him out, Delaney. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. I'll tell you what I'll do. I'll compromise. We'll both get in the ring at the same time. He won't do it, and I won't insult him by asking. Well, suit yourselves, gentlemen. I got plenty of time. - I'll just take a little nap. - Take it easy, Jim. Lay down. Go on. Go on. Go on. Get out of here. Oh, don't shut that door like that, Walter. You know it's bad luck. There's a free-for-all going on downstairs. Sullivan won't get in the ring first and Corbett says he won't, either. They're both superstitious so they're both going in together. Here comes Corbett now. How are you, boys? Nice to see you. Hello, Judge. - Hello. - Hello, Miss Ware. - Was that you booing just now? - Yes. - I thought so. - Boo! Now we both get through at the same time, all right? - All right, all right. - Right. - Ready? - Yes. Let's go. What is the idea? Just for that, I'll knock you flat in the first round. - Be quiet. - But I don't care. Ladies and gentlemen! A fight to the finish for the heavyweight championship of the world. In this corner, introducing at 178, from San Francisco, the challenger, James J. Corbett. He thinks he's playing Hamlet. In this corner at 212, the world's champion. From Boston, John L. Sullivan. Let her go. You men must observe the Marquess of Queensberry rules under which this championship battle is to be fought. No foul punches. When I tell you to break, you step back clean. No punches in the breakaway. Now, shake hands and come out fighting with the bell. Watch your beard now, Mr. Sullivan. Don't trip over it. Steady, Jim. Steady. Left jab! - Move around! - Knock him over, Jim! Come on, Jim. Come on. The end of round three. A thousand says Corbett won't come up for the sixth. Seems like all this Corbett fella wants... - Got any results from the fight yet, Jim? - Just coming over now. Sullivan looked very tired in the 17th. Pardon me. The 19th round, sir. Sullivan hasn't laid a glove on him. Here's another fight report, boys. It's the end of the 20th round. Corbett's still going great. That's it, Jim. Get him, Jim. Get him, Jim. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10! The winner and new heavyweight champion of the world, James J. Corbett! Hurray, hurray, Jim! Come on, come on. Right here. Go on, Ma. You and Pa go out and take a bow. Don't let him fall over, though. Go on, Mary. No, I don't want to. I want to go with you. This is a historic occasion, Vicki. A new king takes the throne. With all the pomp and glory. And does he love it. Do you think it's gone to his head? Wait a second. I'll show you what I think. Great boy, this Corbett. Got a great future. Knew it the first time I laid eyes on him. So did I. You know, this is a great honor for San Francisco. And for the Olympic Club. Don't forget, we picked him up. And don't forget, you threw him out. I worked on that left hook of Jim's for years. I showed him how to bring it up inside just like he did tonight. Did I ever tell you that Jim and I used to work side by side in a bank? To tell you the truth, I'm the one that talked him into being a prize fighter. He comes by his fighting from my side of the family. The Kerry killers they used to call us in the old country. "Look out," you could hear them yell. "Here comes the Corbetts!" Wait a minute, wait a minute, you big bag of wind. How about us O'Douls? There never was a time when one O'Doul couldn't handle a whole wagonload of Corbetts. Fix your tie. Yes, darling. I'm no bag of wind. Don't you say that. Have a drink. Just put it there. Congratulations, Mr. Corbett. - Thank you, Miss Ware. Thank you. - Oh, I have a present for you. - A present from you? - Yes. For me? It can't be lilies, 'cause I'm still here. Well, it wouldn't take many of those to make a dozen. How'd you guess my size? - Hello Jim. - Hello, John L. - How are you feeling? - All right. A little tired. Me, too. I got something I wanted to give you, meself. I've had it a long time. Take good care of it, will you? Thanks. Thanks, John. I will. I'll try to do it as much honor as you have. You know something? The first time I saw you fight, I was just a bit of a kid. There wasn't a man alive who could have stood up to you then. And tonight, well, I was just mighty glad that you weren't the John L. Sullivan of 10 years ago. Is that what you're thinking now? That's what I was thinking before I even got into the ring with you. That's a fine decent thing for you to say, Jim. I don't know how we might have come out, say, eight or 10 years ago. Maybe I was faster then. But if I was, tonight you're the fastest thing on two feet. Sure, it was like trying to hit a ghost. I don't know much about this gentleman stuff they're handing out about you, but maybe you're bringing something new to the fight game, something it needs and never got from fellas like me. I don't know, but I do know this, though it's tough to be a good loser, it's a lot tougher to be a good winner. Thanks again, John. I hope that when my time comes, I can go out with my head just as high as yours. There'll never be another John L. Sullivan. Thank you, Jim. - Good luck to you. - Good luck to you. - You're thinking about Sullivan? - Yeah. I can see him now, walking back to his room, alone, lying there all night and thinking, "What's the use of ever getting up again?" John L. He'll never thump another bar and shout, "I can lick any man in the world. " He must be lost. You like Mr. Sullivan, don't you? - Yeah, I do. - And he likes you. The man who pushed him off his throne. You know, one's heart plays funny tricks sometimes. - How do you figure that out? - Oh, a woman doesn't figure things out, she just knows all at once. I've never known a woman yet who just doesn't know all at once. - Look, if you're so smart, tell me this. - I'll try. - But I don't know how far I can get. - Do you and I like each other? - Well, you like me all right and... - Oh, I get it. I like you, but you're not sure whether you like me, huh? I didn't say that. Now, don't talk for me, I can do my own talking. Well, all right. Go ahead. Talk. How do we stand? Yes, I like you. I think you like me more than I like you. But it wouldn't surprise me if I loved you more than you love me. Love? Us? And then again, I may be wrong. That's very funny. You in love with a, what was it you called me, a shanty Irishman? Don't kid me, kiddo. And that's exactly what you are, a tinhorn, shanty Irishman. And besides that, you can't see any further than the end of your nose. - There you go, getting sore again. - You tinhorn... Now wait a minute. Tinhorn, huh? Shanty Irish, huh? Come here. Well, what are you laughing at? You're gonna make a marvelous Corbett. - A fine way for a gentleman to behave. - Oh, darling. That gentleman stuff never fooled you, did it? - I'm no gentleman. - In that case, I'm no lady. Give them room! Give them room! Give them room! The Corbetts are at it again! The Corbetts are at it again!
