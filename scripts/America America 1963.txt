This story was told me over the years by the old people in my family. They remember Anatolia, the great central plateau of Turkey and Asia. And they remember the mountain, Erciyes, standing above the plain. Anatolia was the ancient home of Greek and Armenian people. But 500 odd years ago, the land was overrun by the Turks... and from that day the Greeks and Armenians lived here... but as minorities. The Greek subject people. The Armenian subject people. They wore the same clothes as the Turks... the fez and the sandal... ate the same food, suffered the heat together... used the donkey for burdens. And they looked up to the same mountain... but with different feelings... for, in fact, they were conqueror... and conquered. The Turks had an army. The Greeks and the Armenians lived as best they could. But the day came, here in Anatolia, as everywhere there's oppression... when people began to question. There were bursts of violence, sudden and reckless. People began to wonder, and some to search for another home. You say in America they have mountains bigger than this? In America, everything's bigger. What else? What else in America? What are we waiting for? Come on you, let's go you, with the help of Jesus. We better sell this ice before it melts. The year is 1896. A Turkish provincial governor has called... an emergency meeting of his council. Be seated, be seated, please. Your glasses, Governor. This came an hour ago, over the wire from the capital. Your Excellency... On this day, the eve of our national feast of Bayram... Armenian fanatics have dared to set fire... to the National Turkish Bank in Constantinople. It is the wish of our Sultan... Abdul Hamid the Resplendent, the shadow of God on earth... that the Armenian subject people throughout his empire... be taught, once and for all, that acts of terror... cannot be tolerated. Our Sultan has the patience of the Prophet... but he has now given signs that he would be pleased... if this lesson were impressed, once and for all... upon this dangerous minority. How this is to be effected will be left to Their Excellencies... the governors of each province... ...and to the army post commanders stationed in each provincial capital. Stop! Stop! Help yourself, sir, help yourself. Jallal... bring something. Sir, Your Honour... help yourself, sir, help yourself. That's what he needs, encouragement. But, Your Honour... What do you want? Not I, the ice, it's nature is to melt. It does not consider we have to go all the way to the market to sell it. In plain language, you want me to hurry? If you would. All right now? You had too much of a load for this dear old horse. Now, she'll get you to market more quickly, agreed? Yes, sir, agreed. Are you Armenian? Greek, sir, Greek. Where do you live? Over that hill. And you? Down below. -And you are? -Armenian. Armenian? Did he have anything to do with burning the bank in Constantinople? Why do you smile? You are joking. How could we have been there yesterday? It's two weeks' journey. Even with this horse? Captain Mahmed. -How do you know my name? -We served together 8 years ago. That is, I served you, and you served your Sultan, Abdul Hamid... the shadow of God on earth. I was your orderly, so naturally you've forgotten me. Remember? I stole chickens for you. Vartan, you! Vartan! -I didn't recognise you. -I know, but I'm Vartan. Vartan, my little lamb, what happened to you? Well, as you can see, I'm trying to make a few coppers. With this dear, dying stud. Hey, come on, Jallal, put the ice back, quickly. Hurry, before it melts. Your people burn our buildings, and you expect us to say thank you? No. Today, no Armenian will be forgiven... for being an Armenian. I beg you, stay up here with me. But he has his mother and father down there and his little brother. Then it is in the hands of God. Vartan! Vartan! Vartan! -What's happened? -They're in the church... mother, father, all our family, our people. Father says come now. I've got this ice to sell now. Don't be seen with this Armenian, Stavros, stay away from him. I can't do that. Your mother is looking for you. Go home, quickly. No one is on the streets. I'm going to the Guitars. What for? For my satisfaction. But the Turks drink there. Here comes your mother. Your father says don't work with that man! You're not a child anymore! Why do I have to take you by the ear like a child and drag you home? Like a child! Say something! Answer me when I talk to you! Stay away from that man! He was with the Armenian again, Isaac, your eldest. You've given your father a terrible day of worry. Kiss his hand and ask forgiveness. He's too easy with you. You're too easy with him, Isaac, if you'll forgive me. It's not my place to say so, but... Have you had dinner? I'm not hungry. Vasso, give him some food. But, I'm not hungry. You'll eat something. Who is this Armenian? Damadian's son, Vartan. He doesn't know his place. It's not our affair. They're Armenians, we're Greeks, our necks aren't the same. True. They're saving the Greeks for their next holiday. -What did he say? -We all heard what he said. Where were you? Father's been looking for you. Just like a woman! What's happening? The jails are empty. -Who are those two? -I don't know. The Armenian's going to dance. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. America... America. Let's go. If we don't go now, we'll never get another chance. Armenians. To the church. The captain says come now. -It's beginning! -All Turks! Where is your captain? Have pity on us. Have pity on us! Vartan, Vartan, Vartan, they're inside! Father, mother, everyone. Do something! Go back and tell them to come out and beg for mercy. Go! Mama, Papa, open the door. Mama, open the door. Come on, come on, open, open the door! -Stavros! Stavros! -No one leaves here. -No one leaves this section. -I'm taking him home. Where's the Greek? The Armenians started it. It's always the Armenians. Don't disturb us now, them first. Every few years we have to teach the Armenians. The Greeks are more peaceful. You see, the patient man waits. As the Prophet said... hatred exhausts itself. It's no comfort for me that the Armenians started this. I believe that some day, with Allah's help... all races will live together in peace, even the Armenians. That's the hope of mankind. They are bringing him, my friend, they are bringing your boy. See? A fine young man. Now, smile. Smile. I am very grateful to you. It's not only that I like you, I like all the Greek subject people. We all know that. I'm here only for the good I can do. I make nothing here, you realise that. And I do good. I do help, don't you think? Oh, yes. We're all very grateful. I was referring particularly to you, you have a good business here... the Turkish people like you, and you have a good business. We make a living. Hold him there a moment. I happen to know you do very well and that makes me happy. Very happy. Come, my dear friend, join us. Come, come. Here, here. To our friends everywhere. Be grateful the governor is my friend... That's the way it is here! Stavros! Stavros! Grandmother! Grandmother! Grandmother! I came to see you, Grandmother. You don't look well. How's that good Greek, your father? You know why the fox loves the rabbit? Because he hasn't any teeth. How's your father? Your grandfather was a man. I was expecting you. He told me you were coming. Who? Your grandfather. He came he to see me last night. I think he's found a new wife in the land of the dead. Well... What can you do? But he still comes to see me. What's the matter? Nothing. Why? You're moving around like a criminal. What do you want? I just came to see you. You're lying. I hope to God you're not going to be like your father. Already you've got his smile. What are you going to do? All the men in our family lie. The Turks spit in their face and they say it's raining. Be honest. Tell me what you came for. Don't lie again. Your grandfather told me what you wanted. What did he tell you I wanted? Money. True? True. Why should I give you money? What do you need it for? You're an old woman. Get out, you're just like your father! Get out! Don't do that. Listen to me. You're my last hope, do you know that? You're going to listen to me. I'm going away. Good. Far away. The farther, the better. To America, I'm going to America. Give me enough to get to Constantinople. There, I'll work and make the rest. Hear me. You're my last hope. Put me down. Long ago... you used to say to me when I come of age... you had something to give me. I remember you as a little baby... soft and round and made of butter. And I remember you in a little blue dress that your mother made you. A little saint, with a blessed, pale face. And your eyes, shining with God's own light. My boy. I thought, if only the whole world were like that. Here, take it. It was your grandfather's. I don't need this, I need money. You need this more, take it. It will remind you that no sheep ever saved its neck by bleating. I'll take it and put it in the first soldier I meet. Stavros! I'm an old woman, you can't frighten me. Where's your money? I need money. It is here, under my clothing. You're not going to America, you're your father's son. Go home, be what you are. Anything, anything... help me. Anything? Anything... I'll remember you, in America, I'll pray for you. You? You're going to America? With the help of Jesus. On foot? However. With nothing? Each day, part of the distance. How will you get there with those? Take these. Where do you come from? Far away. See those clouds? Behind those clouds there are mountains. The mountains of Armenia. I shall never see them again. I'll remember you. Isaac! Isaac, the family is eating. Isaac, I've brought you some food. I want you to eat something. He did this once before, stayed in there for nine days. Isaac. Isaac. You're forgetting who you are. If I want food, I'll call you. I don't want to see you, I want to see my son. Stavros. Stavros. Where are your shoes? What did you do with your shoes? I've been waiting for you. What? Where? Where have you been? Vasso, leave. Yes, Isaac. Remember, you're talking to your father. Come here, boy. Sit close to me. You look changed. When I don't see you for a day, you look changed. Will you have a coffee? No, thank you father. You'll have a coffee with me. Two coffees, immediately. Immediately. Look at your feet. Make sure the shutters are closed. The door! Father... I've made up my mind. We're going to send you to Constantinople. What did you say, father? Our family is going to leave this place. You'll go first. You will take everything this family has of wealth. You will. I said everything of wealth... this family has. Dig. Dig. This winter, I'll come here at night and we'll weave together. By the day of your wedding, you'll have all the blankets you need. From time to time, I've had to do things that... We live by the mercy of the Turk. But, Stavros, I've always kept my honour safe inside me. Safe, inside me. And see, we're still living. After a time, you don't feel the shame. Dig. Lace collars? What will you do with them, dearie? Make yourself pretty? It's too late, little dearie. Yesterday, I got this from our cousin in Constantinople. I'll be honoured. Let Stavros bring money for my business... and I'll make him my partner. He has a prospering establishment, a prospering establishment. Will it really be better for us in Constantinople? Yes, it will be. Where else can we go? It's our last hope. You'll take our smoked meat. You'll take the two big rugs on the floor upstairs. In fact, everything you can sell. Our donkey, you'll take our donkey... and sell him when you get to Constantinople. The jewellery... The jewellery which came with Vasso... when I took her for a wife. This was my mother's. See? She's wearing it there, look. I was going to give it to you when you got married. It's better this way, mother. In time, you'll bring your three sisters... Are the shutters closed? You'll bring your three sisters to Constantinople. As the eldest, your responsibility is to see they marry well. Then, as your business prospers... you'll bring your four brothers out to your side. As the eldest, your responsibility is to set them up in business. Then it will be your mother's turn. It is your responsibility to make her final days happy ones. Don't ask too much. Vasso, there's a right way and a wrong way. Yes, Isaac. We commit our eldest son to your care. Watch over him, he is our hope. Mother. He's trusting you with everything... Vasso! Forgive me, Isaac. Teach him that the meek shall inherit the earth. Except here. Each and all men are brothers. Trust no one. A gentle word and a Christian smile will turn away all wrong. He's given you his coat. I've sewed the money into the lining. Feel it? Here. And in this little sack, jewellery, feel it? Keep this coat on at all times. Even when you're asleep. Sleep with one eye open. Vasso, be silent! Vasso... Vasso, what is it? My dear God... If you send him to the baker's to bring bread... you're never sure he'll come back. And now, Constantinople, with everything we have. Look at him. Look at him. Vasso... if you and I... have so brought up our eldest son... that he could fail his family at this time... then we deserve to go down. Mother... I won't fail you, Mother. Come on, now. What are you doing? I can't swim! Be careful, the donkey, you'll knock him in! What are you doing? I'll give you whatever you want. I can't swim! I'll give you more money. God will punish you. God knows my problems. Be grateful I'm not looking what's on the donkey's back. Thief! Catch him! Catch him! Thief! Thief! Thief! Thief! Catch him! Catch him! How will I ever thank you? It is I who am fortunate. I, only I, brother. This road to Ankara... is the home of every mother-selling bandit bastard in Turkey. What good fortune is mine to meet a brother on the road! I beg you, it is my good fortune, not yours. What a sweet smile you have. You and I, brothers? Anything I have, is yours. Just as I know everything you have is mine. Brother! Brother, my heart aches, when I see this poor animal... struggling with this load on his back. I'm sure that at this very moment, Allah is saying to himself... "When will that man, who is always smiling... finally become aware of the pain he is causing this poor beast?" Do you think that is possible? No... Yes, I mean... Then we must insist that my animal share the load... I insist. After all, smoked meat is heavy. So? So, as we are brothers of the road... our animals must be brothers as well. Come on, help me. Get down, get down. Mukur. Brother, I know this town well. I've been a helpless victim of many a bandit in the town of Mukur. We'll camp here, on this hillside. What will we do for food? Delicious. Delicious meat. Here, brother, eat. Food is strength. We've 9 or 10 days' journey to Ankara. They say the Prophet walked barefoot... but it must've been over different roads. I can go no further. I thought these shoes would last... but I expected to ride. I wasn't prepared for all this walking. See? What do you think? I beg you, consider... my brother sold a side of delicious meat his family entrusted to him. This is my price. Brother, I did my best. How are the shoes? They pinch. My feet are covered in boils and sores. Perhaps you could rest in the next town. And you? I'll go on. Oh, no, brother, I could never leave you. Why? Never, never. No, I would never leave you, I could never abandon my brother... but I must have one drink. Brother, my soul is thirsty, my heart is dry... surely you would not deny me one miserable drink. I confess I can't pay for this one. You didn't pay for the others. It was unnecessary for you to remind me that I am less fortunate than you. After all, in friendship, there is only one rule. What's mine, is yours and what's yours, is mine. You have nothing. As the Prophet said, "Who can place a price on wisdom?" Despite the Prophet, this is the last I pay for. You wish you'd never met me. For some reason you cannot speak what is obvious. I had hoped my brother would be for the entire journey. Only last week, a man was murdered between here and Ankara... not far from this town on the road to Ankara. Behold... Allah weeps for me. Allah weeps for me! Allah! Allah, here I am! Abandoned, without friends... alone, without shelter! Abdul, come on, Abdul! All of you, go on. No money, no roof. Get out in the rain. Go ahead. You can't stay here. You chickens, where do you think you're going? That boy has plenty of money. Brother, I've decided not to leave you. You don't seem as happy as I am. Where's that famous smile? Smile! I confess, I sold the meat, but I did it for you, I swear. They say a rope drawn too taut will snap. Now, look. Look what I've brought you. Chingana. Chingana is for you. I don't know the other's name, but we'll find out all about her soon. Join us, come, come! The bear has a nose for females! Here, give me that chair. There's a Greek, attacking without warning! Thank you. I forgive him everything. Brother. I brought up everything out of the rain, brother! What happened? What, brother? They're all here, every beautiful item. Oh, my God. What have you done? Look, look! Oh, my God. They're all here. Every single item. Where are my sister's blankets? While you were asleep, this woman has given me unspeakable pleasure. My sister's blankets. Where is my coat? You're wearing it, brother. Look, here. Oh, my God. I know she must look like a beast. I'll admit that when one is older one's tastes are easily satisfied... but do not go by her appearance, take her into the other room. Penetrate to her soul, go on! My mother's rug! I have never met a more generous and brotherly person than you. This trip is a landmark in my life. You're my brother. Where is my mother's rug? I beg you, don't use that tone of voice. Never mind my tone of voice, where is my mother's rug? You animal! You animal, where is my mother's rug? I gave it to him. To him? You gave my rug to him? What for? What for? To pay for your night's lodging that's what for. You can pay for your room in money. Cash! Give me my sister's blankets! It is a rag. I was ashamed to have my friends see it... so I put it on the floor of the toilet. Give me the cash. I beg your forgiveness, I cannot live without it. Before all this company, I beg your forgiveness. Brother, don't leave me on my knees, don't insult my soul. Brother, I have never before been on my knees to a Greek. With a Turk you can either be a brother or the opposite. I warn you. Brother. Brother. Brother. Too bad. Too bad. That's the thief, take him. Fortunately, Your Honour, I've made an exact list... of every particular this man stole from me in the darkest hour. Lies, lies! Your Honour, he insults your court. "One carpet, the colour of roses and the blue of midnight." Behold, Your Honour. As described. A beautiful piece. "One blanket, the colour of peaches..." -Make him take my coat off. -Take off the coat. I had a terrible time after you left. Those policemen and that judge... offered to divide my new possessions with me. When I declined, they all helped themselves. The judge particularly wanted the rug. The law in this country needs considerable reform. Look, I'll show you what I have left. Nothing, you see? Nothing. There are some coins missing. About six of them, by my estimates. I came to the conclusion that you'd swallowed them. No? I saw you do so in court. At the time, I thought to myself "Let him have something, poor thing." But the situation has changed. I cannot be so generous. I'll admit that you've been patient. If I'd been you, I'd have taken out that blade... and put it to its proper use, but we Turks are primitive... while you Greeks are civilised. I envy you. You've learned how to bear misfortune... swallow insult and indignity and still smile. I truly envy you. Well? Is there anything? Anything moving? Nothing yet? How long do you suppose? Only Allah know that, eh? Drink? You're really such a coward. I've killed men like you before, it's like killing a sheep. One clean cut almost anywhere and the life flows out. A twitch or two, and it's over. A drink? No, of course, you don't drink. You don't fight. You have no use for women. What kind of a man are you? I can't waste any more time on you. I'll have to take those coins. Unfortunately, I have no weapon. I'll have to borrow your knife. Yes? No? What? Why don't you say something? Are you afraid to talk? Do you value your life? Say. I don't know what you people are. Are you like sheep? They won't fight for their lives either. Well... it's the hour of prayer. I'll give you a few minutes. Allah! Great by name, great is thy greatness. There is no deity, but thee. I seek refuge near you, Allah. Suchut! Suchut! Suchut! Constantinople train! Constantinople train! Constantinople. That's all I have. Constantinople train! Let's go! Let's go! Let's go! Let's go! America, hey America! Hey, America! Is she an American lady? No, really, thank you. You won't find a piece like this... Where is this street? What do you want? Can't you see I have customers? -How's business? -No business. Is this the establishment of Topouzoglou? Yes. What do you want? We want nothing. I'm his cousin. When will he wake up? When business comes. You brought dirt in, I'll have to sweep again. I just swept it, just now, five minutes ago. Topouzoglou, this man says he's your cousin. Welcome, welcome. What happened to you? I had a bad dream. My treasure. Eat, eat, that's it. You eat the head? Good for the brain! So you see, I have many customers. What I need is more stock. The rugs I sell... What is it? Forgive me. I was merely going to say that... You don't... seem to be selling what you have. You are very sharp. I do not have the proper goods for the market as it is today. What I will do, after you know the business... is take the money you've brought and go to Persia... and buy the kind of goods... What's the matter? Why did you eat my lunch? I was hungry. Go, out of my sight! No, don't go, please, sit down. For God's sake, give me a chance to swallow this. Here, ruination, sweep. Come in, come in. Well, I will write to your father. He's a good man, if in time... No! No! Listen, no. He must never know what happened. Promise. Not a word. I only meant to say that in time... It would kill him. He put everything in me. Everything? Everything. It will kill him. I'm going to make it up to him. I have big plans. They're going to be proud of me. But now, now nothing. Not a word, promise? Not a word. All right, I promise. Go on, sweep. I have big plans. My ruination. Look how the rich come to work off their lunch in their cars, while... Stavros, listen. There goes Aleko Sinnikoglou, a man with lots of money... and four daughters, each plainer than the other. So much, every day he more and more loses the hope... of becoming a grandfather, do you understand? God solves all problems. You must not forget that you are a young man, handsome... and if properly dressed... Do you understand me now? Never mind, sweep. Tomorrow, I'll arrange the meeting, you'll see. I'll dress you in a nice blue suit and... What? What are you doing? You barbarian! -What about the tariff for carriage? -No, we'll ignore that. I see. Well, this was... What do I need to go to America? Money. First class accommodation. How much? Third class, 110 Turkish pounds. I'll do it right away. Is he American? From Berkeley. Do you give these men something? No, we do it the right way. I'll be back. What did he say? "At any rate, he didn't bring a single penny, says he was robbed. I tried to talk to him, as is my place and duty... but suddenly he threw down a broom... and ran out of the store, his eyes on fire." Now, listen. "Beloved father, I went, as you asked, directly to our cousin... but I couldn't trust him. No one ever comes into his store. He sleeps all day on a pile of rugs so I told him I was robbed. I left. Now I have a new plan. Keep it up! Hang on. Wind the rope tight. Wind the rope further. Go on, hamal! -Doesn't your friend eat? -What's the matter, you sick? You, hamal, don't you get hungry? Learn to spend the coins. What are you saving it for? "Beloved father"... Mama, mama. "I know Mother is worried." We have a letter, close the shutters. "But, there's no cause to be. My health is good... and my appetite is very good, very good." This isn't garbage, it's from the Sultan's table... what he doesn't eat. "One way or another, I get what I need to eat. So don't worry, one day, you'll be proud of your son. Remember, I have big plans. Big plans. That day will come, I promise you. You'll be proud of me." I'm cold, I need a woman tonight. You want to come? I'll pay for it. You need it. I need nothing. Did you ever have one? Don't you want one? My father wouldn't approve. Father? Approve! Where are you going? I have another job. Now? Another job? Tonight? Kill yourself with this, it's easier. Take it easy. Hold it, hold it! It's time, they're out there working! How much for a ticket? What? How much for a ticket? And you've saved by now? What do you care? How much? Four pounds. Four pounds? Now, tell me, how long do you expect to live? Longer than you! That load is for an animal! Get an animal! Hey, hamal... you. America, America, you! Don't take it, don't take it. Come on! What time is it? You've got time. I can't stay awake, I keep falling asleep. Don't worry, you'll be dead soon. What's the baby weigh now? How much? Seven pounds. Small money. There's two kinds of money, small and big money. Small money is a whore, you look at her coins... she's been in everyone's hands you wake in the morning, she's gone. Then there's big money, like you need. You're going to America. What you need is big money. You like that? Behold, you're human! That's all there is, women. Now then, big money. Big money is fertile, it procreates. How, I don't know. But it reproduces, every time you look, there's more. But there's only two ways men like us can get big money. Steal it, or if you're young... marry it. You can't get it by work. Study me. I worked like an animal... from the first day I could walk and carry. So? Behold, the lowest form of life. Now, if I were you... there are very many very ugly girls with rich fathers. Let's get ourselves a couple of those little mousetraps. Come on, boy, you need it. I need nothing. You need it. Afterwards, you come to my place, I have one there for you. Something nice. I have... I have never been with... I don't know exactly what to do. They show you all that. America, America! America, America! Hey, Abdul... Come on, come on. What happened? My money! Where's the girl? I've got to find her. I've got to find her! Nine months, nine months work! Get out of here! Come here, you! -Who did you give his money to? -The owner, downstairs. The owner? Please don't hurt me. He was going to put me out on the street. -Please! -Come on. Do you want me out on the street? What am I without a room and a bed? I'm an animal without a bed and a room! If you go to whores, you must expect to be robbed. Three months she didn't pay. She says next week. Three months she didn't pay. Coffee? We're enjoying ourselves here. Get out. Get out, before I get angry. Get out, now! If you were mighty you could've put together 110 pounds... the way you did the seven. That way you have to have strength. What's the use of this? Tell me that. What's the benefit of this crying? You want to kill her? Why not go kill her? lt'll do you good. It's time you grew up and saw the truth. "Big things! Big things! They're gonna be proud of me." "They're gonna be proud of me, some day they'll be proud." You're nothing now and you never will be! I am, I am, I will be! I'm leaving. There is a better place. It's all the same. Since you left home, have you met one follower of Christ? Have you met one human being? You. Me? Look at my face, you don't know me. You don't know what I am. You don't know who I am. I have one idea for this world. Destroy it and start over again. -Who's that? -He's with us. There's too much dirt. It calls for fire, it needs a flood. I don't know where to look further, dear cousin. He has disappeared from the face of this black world. The chiefs of the Turkish Empire are the people themselves. Turkey will be a great nation. After I'm dead, I'm not interested. He still thinks there's a clean life somewhere. America! Look who's going to America. America? Don't tell me about America. -I was there. -Tell him. I built one of their buildings. I fell and then no one wanted me. If you have money in America, you're somebody. If you have no money, it's just like here. Life is for the rich. Anyone who wants to go, go now. Again, after the explosions, we separate. We meet one month from today. On the streets, we don't acknowledge each other. Is that clear? Look at him, a boy, all he wanted was something. What? Freedom? What? -Do you know when a man is dead? -I can tell when a mule is dead. It's the same, but this is a matter of hours. Throw him on the wagon. -I'm off duty. -Go on, throw him in. It's finished. They won't go. It's too heavy. He has to go, go! Cousin! Cousin! Cousin! Oh, my God, my God! Poor little boy, poor little boy, poor little boy. Damn fool boy! Maybe now you'll do what I tell you. Please, don't tell my father. Please, I have plans. You have plans. My ruination! Now, you look like money. Go and sit over there. In the fourth row, see? The fourth row. That's the girl, the one for you. Don't stare. Turn back, they're looking. The one in the middle, see her? That's the one. So, there remains this question. Is his father able to bring with the boy... a substantial amount of money? -You're talking about money? -We must talk about it. -We have questions too. -But you know our business. You have four daughters, there's a necessary division. -For each, there will be enough. -Enough, enough. He's here! Aleko! Button up, for God's sake. Welcome, welcome to my home. Step in, won't you? Stavros Topouzoglou. Glad to have you here. -You'll never make me look pretty. -Stop frowning, you'll get a line. Thomna! Would you care for a coffee? Thank you. Our guest will try your coffee. How would you like it? No sugar, thank you. -You heard. -Yes, father. Please, sit down. He has a very strong voice. This house has been in our family for three generations. Very nice. -This is my brother, Serafin. -May you live forever. I kiss your mother's hand. My brother, Prothermos. I kiss you mother's hand. This is my... Anula! Keep those women quiet in there. We can't hear each other. All day, from the kitchen... And clear her out. All day long, muzz, muzz, muzz. I've asked her a thousand times. Women! God made the mistake of giving them tongues. Stavros, Stavros... -Has he money? -I don't know. Your father will find out. You look beautiful. May I know the nature of your father's business? My father? Yes. Oh, my father. My father is various different businesses. That's fine, fine. A great variety of enterprises is very wise, very wise. Oh, yes, very. One goes up... one goes down. One goes up... one goes down. Excellent. That was Thomna? Thomna, yes. They say that a long nose is a sign of virtue. With a nose like that, virtue is inevitable. They have money though. Listen to this. "They insisted I give up the work I was in..." Did he ever say what that was? "So, what could I do? I accepted a position with their firm." Ah, smart. Help me... -Anything, anything... -Get out of here! My shoes! Those are my shoes. Don't you remember me? Don't be afraid. Those are my shoes. I remember you. We made it to here, eh? No one stops us. We are going to get there. I used to think so, but now I don't know. Don't give up, don't give up now. You're just hungry. Are you hungry? I'm always hungry. Another one. You want another pilaff? Waiter! Here, bring another pilaff, immediately, and more bread. I see hamals are eating here now. Put some of these in your shirt. No. Another piece, you'll need it later. No one is looking. You have to look out for yourself in this world, you know. The horrible times I had was when I was... soft, or human. You can't afford to be human. People take advantage. For instance, you... you smile all the time. People take it... Forgive me for saying so... People take it as a sign of weakness. In America, that will not be necessary. I've decided. My daughter shall come to you with 500 Turkish pounds. I do not accept. -Why? -Aleko, Aleko... Why, my boy? What do you want? There's something about you I don't understand. But, have it your own way. The main thing is she wants you. Right. Yes, that's satisfactory. Then, smile. Don't you ever smile? So it shall be, two months. The sooner, the better. Two months. Two months. And one more thing... it is our understanding that you will be living here with us. You will not take our daughter away from us. I will not take your daughter away from you. Of course. At last, I have a son. Too much food. Too much. I tell those women not to put so much food on the table. They don't listen to me. Always, too much. Anula! Too much food! Always! First fish, then chicken, then lamb... Two would be enough. They don't listen. -So, you're going to leave me then. -Oh, Baba. Oh, Baba! One more week... one more week and I'm going to lose my daughter. -Are you happy? -Oh, Baba... I'm frightened. That's natural. But, you like him? Yes. Yes. But, he's so mysterious. Maybe he's frightened too. -What does he say when you're alone? -Nothing. -He never talks to you? -Never. Yes, once he showed me some pictures in a book. -Pictures? -Of a city in America. Very tall buildings. He told me all about them... how tall they were, as if he'd been there. He told me he once had a dream to go there. I didn't know what to say. Baba. Baba... Don't worry, don't worry. All boys have dreams. I had the same dreams, once... when I was a boy, to go to new lands, start a new life. But... people think one way when they're penniless... and another way when the money comes. I wish he were more like... like you! There's no man like your Baba, no man, anywhere. Don't worry, we'll make him forget about the other. I'll give him money, and you'll give him babies... your mother will put flesh on his bones and he'll be a man. Yes. Oh, yes. Oh, Baba, I feel better. Look at him. Go ahead, let it out, let it out. Let it out! You've got a stomach, let it out! Come on, come on, don't be ashamed. Let your stomach out, it's natural. You didn't take your coffee. No, no supper. I shall not eat again until tomorrow. You'll feel different in a few hours. I do not wish to see food again today. That is final. -He always says that. -What are you showing him? -Pictures of the island. -The island? The island is beautiful, we have a beautiful place there. My boy, we'll go there this summer. We'll pack the two donkeys, and go for a picnic. He's talking about food already. By next summer, I'll have digested this meal. There are beautiful places for a picnic. -Flying insects. -What? Anula doesn't like flying insects. Buzz, buzz! We'll have the picnic on our porch. A wonderful porch, it's screened. A king would be lucky to have it. You and I will sit there, Stavros... with plenty of women to look after us. -We'll wait, the years will pass... -Only nine months. I know it takes only nine months. Whatever it takes, we'll wait. Nine months, ten, so long as it's a boy. A son, and then another. Two sons first, after that, I don't care. -You can't order. -I know! Who should know better? Give me two sons... give me two sons, and I'll give you the business, everything. My share. My brothers are there, but there's plenty for everyone. Just give me two sons, and then watch the years go by. The winters here, summers in the island. Pretty soon your eldest will say... "Father, I've met a girl, I'd like to get married." You'll say, "How much money has she got? What dowry will she bring?" You'll get heavier and Thomna will get bigger... in certain places, especially. Like Anula. I didn't say where. And watch the years pass. You'll get old, I'll be old... and we'll sit here together, you and I... and we'll drink and we'll eat... and unbutton the tops of our trousers... and we'll take a nap... right here, side by side, a little nap. The women will muzz-muzz from the kitchen... and then we'll wake and play a little backgammon. Soon, it will be time for a little ouzo, some olives... a little cheese... And all my children and all your children will be here... together. And only you and I will talk, Stavros... because I've taught my women respect. When you talk, everyone will be quiet. And when I talk, even you will be quiet. And when I die... we will die properly... surrounded by women looking after us. How does that sound to you? That's all a man should want. I've a little surprise for you both. Come, follow me. Come. Women! Women, quickly, follow me! Hurry, now. Hurry, now! Come on! Come on, come on. Come, now. Make way! Who lives up there? I don't know. Hurry, hurry! For God's sake, come on! Stavros... Take it. It's yours. Go ahead. God bless you. Come on. For you. Get a hold of yourself. This is your bedroom, Stavros. Stavros, see this here... everything here belongs to someone. Baba, thank you, but please, take everybody away now. I want to find out how he likes it. I will, my heart. Out, out, out! Everybody out. Come on, get out. Stop bothering Stavros. She's not bothering me... I like your family. Do you like me? Yes. Would you tell me if you didn't? No, I wouldn't, but I do like you. A husband should like a wife. I'm sorry, you don't have to say anything. Shall we go? No, let's stay here. I've never talked to you without my family. We have. If you say so. When? Several times. Of course. Stavros, please don't take offence at what I'm going to say... but it seems to me... that you have some worry... some secret that you're not... No. Not that I'll expect you to tell me everything... or anything, if you don't want to. I want everything to be the way you want it to be. Do you hear me? Yes, Thomna. I wish I were prettier for you. Don't worry about that. But, I'm a good girl. You'll see, I am a good girl. Just tell me what you want me to do. I'll do anything you tell me to do. Thomna. Thomna, please stop crying. Stop crying, please. Please, stop. I'm frightened. Of what? Of your silence. Say something. Say something to me. Say something, please! Say something! Something, something, something, something! I'm sorry. I've been nervous all morning. I had a dream last night. Can I tell you about it? If you like. Do you want to hear it, or don't you? Do you want to hear it? Would you like a glass of water? No! I'm sorry, I'm ashamed of myself. I'm acting like a... like a young girl. I dreamt... that we had a child. The baby looked like you... with fuzzy brown hair all over his head... and soft all over. And the back of his neck was straight and proud like yours. The little thing was hungry... so I opened myself to it. And he came to me with his mouth... and there was no milk. I had no milk. And he pulled at me and pulled at me... I don't think I can tell you the rest. Turn your head away just a little bit. The baby had teeth. The teeth hurt. The baby turned into you. I mean... it was you. And... you pulled back... and you looked at me with such disappointment... and then you walked away... and I never saw you again. Do you believe in dreams? Yes. You'd do that? Yes. Stavros, what are you saying to me? Stavros... America? Yes. And you...? I still don't understand... You mean you want it so much? You have to be... what I am... to understand. What will you do now? I don't know, something. Stavros... If you want to take our money... and go to the United States of America... No. I'm yours, Stavros. What I have is yours. How can you be like that? I have no reason to live, except you. I just wish I were prettier for you. How can anybody be like you? How can anybody be like you? Thomna. Don't trust me. For your happiness, don't trust me. You're all I have. I can't do different. Don't trust me. Stavros. Stavros... it will pass, Baba said so. Once we have children, you won't feel the same way. You can't, how could you? What? Stavros, it will pass. I'll count on it. Don't count on it. Where are you going? Wait! Wait one year, and then if... Of course, it's up to you to decide. I won't say anything to my father, Stavros. I'll wait. I saved these pretty pieces, nine by twelve, for you. Faster, boys! In the back of the store, like eggs under a hen. Go on, show it! Come on! This was woven, ideal for the home... of the biggest American millionaire. Feel. You know rugs better than I... but you've never seen anything like it. Yes, yes, yes. I know. Mrs. Kebabian, Mrs. Kebabian... I beg you, put your hands on this, feel. She doesn't know about the business except how to live off it. Well, if only for her pleasure. Feel it. Can I see you later, for a minute? Stavros! Wake up, for God's sake, and bring this rug over here. -What's the matter? -Don't inconvenience yourself. I don't like rugs. Mrs. Kebabian, may I present the future king. One day, all this will be his. Stavros Topouzoglo, my future son-in-law. Stavros, kiss Mrs. Kebabian's hand. You don't have to kiss my hand, boy. Of course, in America, you don't do that. Would you please show him how they do in America? Believe me when I tell you that this boy's whole dream... Mr. Sinnikoglou, don't tell me, tell my husband. He's going to buy, he's just torturing you first. May I offer you some sherry? It's very sweet, very light sherry. -No, thank you. -It's really very light. No, thank you. Show him how they do in America, Mrs. Kebabian. -Go on. -Well... Here... No, not like that, take hold of it. Good, now, shake it like this. You do this too, in America? I mean, men to women? -Of course. -His whole dream... is to go to America, imagine! -People have done it. -But not a boy, like this. Men! Aratoon, where are you going? Aratoon, don't go. The rug. I'm beat. My stomach is my clock. -All right, I'll take 25. -Take them all. You're American? Yes. I was born here... Mr. Kebabian brought me to America What? Sofia, I'm going. I'm not. But you must. They're waiting for us at Abdullah's. -My package! -I spoke to the shop. Later, please. ...when I told him that Mr and Mrs Aratoon Kebabian... You know that everything you ever ate here was remarked on. She must come, she's getting thinner. She doesn't eat. I married a woman, now look. I don't enjoy eating when I'm not hungry. See how she talks back? They ruined her. The day she became an American citizen, ruined. The declaration of independence was politics only... not for women! There's no hope for her. -Sofia, I'm leaving the carriage. -Aratoon! Stavros, help her with the package. Aratoon, Aratoon. Thank you. Thank you. -Hello, Madam. -Bertha, get lunch for Mr... Topouzoglou. No, don't trouble yourself. Put the packages on the sofa. See what Mr. Topouzoglou will have. No, too much trouble, too much trouble. No. No, it's not any trouble. I don't enjoy eating when I'm not hungry. Well... all Greeks are taught to refuse twice. It's the third refusal that's to be believed. Can I get you something? You've been so kind. That's a bureau? A whole bureau? And it travels with you? Can I...? Please, come in. Here. And down there, look, that's for shoes. America, America! Do you have any magazines from there? Pictures? Would you like to see them? Can I? I'll show you the "Saturday Evening Post" and "Ladies' Home Journal". No, no more, Mrs. Kebabian. -Is he still here? -Yes, Mrs. Kebabian. Good. You still here? He's still here. Good evening, Mr. Kebabian. -He'll have dinner with us. -Don't put your things on my bed. He'll show us some dancing. Do you know where we can see dancing? You do, don't you? Yes. Enough! Enough! I pay, I pay! I pay! I pay! I was eighteen when my father said to marry him. I'd never been permitted to see... that wonder of man, alone, till him. The day after the wedding... he took me to America... and before I knew how, I had two sons. After that... What? He'd had what he wanted of me. There I was... an almost old woman... two sons, a husband with a good business... who played cards every night. I have never known... a young man. I've never lived my 20th year or my 21st... my 22nd year... is still inside me, waiting like a baby to be born. Do you understand? How could you understand? Let's take him home. Third class reservation, First, give me the ticket. Yes, sir. I'm Mr. Agnastis. Do you have my tickets ready? -Yes. -I'm here with my boys. Yes, let me find your ticket. You! You're going, eh? Didn't I tell you not to give up? You're good. Tell me what happened. That man is taking us all. Eight boys, yes, in one cabin. That was the understanding. I've done this every year, eight boys in one cabin... you've always allowed it. -Only now, suddenly, objections. -Just a moment. You're all going? Yes. There's a place to shine shoes in New York City. He's paying our passages. What do you do? We shine shoes. We work for him... two years, without pay. Would he take another? No. Many boys want it, but he'll only take eight. I came to the store once to tell you, but... you got into a carriage with a rich man. You looked very busy, very big... plenty to eat, so I thought... Right or wrong is for the rich. You can afford it, I can't. You come from a good family. Yes, who are now waiting for one piece of good news. One piece! But your father... I don't want to be my father, or your father... I don't want that good family life, good family life... all those good people stay here and live in this shame. The churchgoers who give to the poor live in shame. The respectable, polite ones with good manners. But, I am going. No matter how. No matter, no matter. I am going! I told you to come here... because I wanted to tell you the truth. The truth of what I am, so you don't go on thinking about me. You took off your... That was for your father. What's that? Oh, are you taking that with you? Of course. You can't count on anybody or anything. With this, I can always eat. Oh, Stavros. I know that I'll never again find anyone like you. Oh, God! What will happen to you? I believe... I believe that, in America... I believe that I will be washed clean. Mr. Topouzoglou. Would you like some tea? Madam prefers it when you smile. I've been waiting. Bertha... how do flies get on a ship? Mr. Agnastis, what's that over there? Is that land? America! America, America! -What's the disturbance? -Long Island. Oh, well... -How long did I sleep? -A couple of hours. I'll tell Mrs. Kebabian you're awake. -Mr. Kebabian is awake. -Correct. -She'll come as soon as she's pretty. -I have a long wait. Casino. Bertha... Now, come, Bertha, just the truth. Stavros! Stavros! Hohaness! Stavros. America! Stop it. Stop it, all right. Look, I brought you some candy. Here, take it, come on. That lady friend of yours... has the most wonderful candy. Tomorrow, I'll get one of those straw hats that the Americans wear. First thing. Tomorrow, since you're without protector or employment... the authorities will ship you back where you came from. Now, may I give you some advice? Go fall on your knees before Aleko Sinnikoglou... shed a tear or two, however false, kiss his hand and so on. He'll take you back, he has no choice. And from this unpleasantness, learn this lesson... when you force a woman to choose, she'll choose money, eh, Emilio? Well? She's a good person. She's next door, her ear to the door... hearing every word, why is she silent? Well? I'm curious, what are you going to do now? You know, I've never seen a face like yours except in a cage. I think there's nothing you'd stop at. Anything. Have you any honour? Honour? My honour is safe inside me. Safe inside you? Boy, whatever you once were, you're now a whore... a boy whore for sale, do you understand? Stop that humming. I've seen hundreds like you. Boys who leave home to find a clean life and just get dirtier. Stop that humming! Tell me, have you looked in the mirror recently? Do you suppose if your father saw you he'd recognise his son? Stop it! Stop it! What are you doing? What are you doing? He's done more for me than you've done in your entire life! I won't let him do that to you, I won't. I won't let him do that to him. It's all right. It's all right. Go on, now. Go on. Don't let him do that to you. Go on, now. Don't worry about me. I won't let him do that... Mr. Kebabian... He's going to speak. Yes, sir. I've nothing to say. What can you say? The truth is the truth. You know what you are. Yes, sir. Except, Mr. Kebabian, I have been bitten... robbed, shot, left for dead. I have eaten the Sultan's garbage... and driven the dogs off to get at it. I became a hamal... Now, you understand yourself, a hamal. Yes, sir. But now, I am here. Do you imagine anyone will be able to keep me out? I'll see to it that they send you back. No! Help! Help! Help! Don't say anything, please! Please. Please. Let me stay. He attacked me! He tried to kill me! Criminal! This is America, do you hear? This is America! What will you do now, hamal, eh? What will you do now? Hohaness? Hohaness? Where are you, Hohaness? Hohaness? Are you there? Oh, yes. Is my father still here? Your what? Your father? Who is that? That's the doctor. You're in the ship's hospital. My father said... "That's enough. I'm ashamed of you. I am ashamed of what you've made of yourself. Come back, you must start again." It hurts when I laugh... but can you imagine making this journey all over again? It was a bad dream, go to sleep. Can you imagine all this... Better stay with me. I'll be here when you wake. It's still there. You know the truth? The thing I'd like most in the world... is to make this journey all over again. Just to start it over, all over again. That's the truth. How is he? -He's imagining things. -Well, no wonder. He was hit on the head once too often. You better watch over him. I will. That boy, he might do something crazy. They are sending him back. That's a bad cough. Don't let the officials hear it when they come on board tomorrow. They'll send you right back. Good night. Stavros, they're coming. Excuse me. Coming through. Good morning. Excuse me. Good morning. -Morning, doctor. -Morning. -This your hospital? -Right through there. I'll wait for you here. As soon as the inspection is over, run to me. See? It's the excitement that brings it on. So close your ears... imagine you have just sent them their passage... and your mother and father come to you in gratitude. Can you imagine that scene? Yes, yes. Then, imagine that scene. Go on, now. What are you going to do? I have my own plans. What? Can you swim that far? A man learns what is necessary. If you can't swim, you can't... You better go now. Come on, go on. Come on. Coming through, please. Excuse me. I'll pay you back, some day. Let's speak the truth, we'll not see each other again after tomorrow. You'll forget me, and I'll be where I am. Go on, now. Don't forget, cover your ears. -Well, are these the fellows? -Yes, same as last year... eight fine boys, perfect health... all from fine families, employment guaranteed. Remember, it's the excitement that brings it on. It's the excitement that brings it on, so close your ears. Thank you. I wish you all the best of luck, boys. All right, boys, everything is all right. Mr. Allen? -You'll come to see us, I hope. -I'll drop in, once in a while. -You know where our place is. -Yes. Stavros! Stavros! Stavros! Stavros! I mean it, Stavros, if you go, I go, and I can't swim. I'll hold onto you, don't do something crazy. Don't. -I thought your wife was coming. -She was... but she was too sick and too old. -In the end she gave up hope. -I know... Hohanness! Hurry. I'm going. Here, give this to my cousin in Constantinople. His name's here, and the address here. He will send it to my father. Do you understand? That was simply awful! -Third class is so romantic. -The best part of the ship. Inspection! Inspection! He's a friend of my wife's. Sort of a dark fellow. Here. From Mrs. Kebabian. Immediately after the disembarkation... of first class... all third class passengers... will be examined... Fifty dollars? My, my! -Next. -Hello. -Look who's here. -Eight, all told. Eight more little ones. They keep coming, they keep coming. How are all you little slaves? Scared to death. Jack, who was that Greek we're watching for? Criminal assault, was it? On this sheet here. Stavros Topouzoglou... -Any of you go by that name? -That fellow died last night. You, what's your name? You. -Hohaness. -Not you, you. He talks, doesn't he? What's your name? Hohaness Gardashian. Wanna be an American? Yes, sir. Yes, sir. The first thing to do, is to change that name. Do you want an American name, boy? Hohaness Gardashian. I know. That's enough. Hohaness, that's all you need here, Hohaness. Here. Can you read? Joe Arness. Hohaness, Joe Arness. Hohaness, Joe Arness. Joe. Joe. Arness. Arness. Joe Arness. Joe Arness. Good. Joe Arness. You like it? Joe Arness, Joe Arness. Good. Well, Joe, you're reborn. You're baptised again without the clergy. Next! Hey, Joe Arness. Hey, friend, what the hell is that? Just something one of them left behind. Hey, you there! Keep moving, you're blocking traffic! Come on, now. Yes, you. Move it along, let's go! "And here I am. I reached America" And here is fifty dollars. How much is that, fifty dollars? In Turkish money, that is... that is... He saved himself. How did he earn so much money so quickly? America, America. He saved himself. Read it again, the last part. "It's not different here..." Not so loud. There's no one. You never can tell, go on. "It's not different..." How quickly he's forgotten what it is here. "But let me tell you one thing, you have a new chance here... for everyone that is able to get here, there is a fresh start. So get ready, you're all coming. You're coming. I'm working to bring you all here. One by one". Hey, there's a business here! Move on! How's that? There you go, Joe. Next! Come on, you, let's go, people are waiting. Come on, you. Let's go, you. People waiting. People waiting. People waiting. And he did bring them. It took a number of years, but one by one, he brought them here. Except for his father. That old man died where he was born. This film was made in Turkey and Greece.
