Then stop fuckin' up a good thing. This is the third relationship you've ruined in the last year. My DICK. The third relationship my DICK has ruined. You can't control your dick? It's like babysitting a nine year old with A.D.D. I mean you try your best until he just wears you down. Then you just give him whatever the hell he wants until his parents come home. But. But! His parents never come home. I can control mine. Not to be a dick, but, You're not presented with as many "Ass Getting" opportunities as I am. - Even if I were -What? - I'd Be -What?

Which ones the best? Well We've got plus-minus, we've got blue-red. And we've got crying baby-smiling woman. - Plus-minus. - Excuse me? Plus-minus.

It's for my friend. She was too emabarrased to come here herself, so. No need to explain. Well I don't want you to think I'm this slut who thinks he's pregnant.

[Zipper Unzips] - Why are there teeth marks on your dick? - What? There are teeth marks on your dick. - What. I. Um. - Did someone give you a blow job? Not that I can recall. Then why are there teeth marks on your dick? I hit that car pretty hard. Who's hair is this? You know what? That looks like, that looks like a pubic hair. Nah your pubes are not that long. Typically yea. But ya know you get that rogue pube that grows faster - Than the others. - It's not even the same color as your head. Okay. I mean.

I mean it's not as easy as you'd think. Okay? It's really not. I don't know. Things just haven't been the same since Kimmy cheated on me. Now you're blaming her? Melissa was right. What are you talkin' about? Nothin'. No no no no. Fuck. tell me what the fuck you're talkin' about. This probably isn't the best time to tell you. But Melissa She posted some pretty fucked up things about you on the internet. Like what? You're afraid of ghosts. You like to fart in the shower. You're a craving man-child with an inferiority complex Who refuses to be held accountable for any of his myriad shortcommings. I think she used a Thesaurus on that last one. - This is online? - Douchebagassholecheaters.com I don't understand how you can have something so special, so great and throw it away for one fleeting moment. Doesn't make sense. Rich would be making low six figures right now if he didn't bend me over the conference table and have his way with me. Don't get me wrong. I loved it. But it ruined our office dynamic. And I had to let him go. Me and Rich used to be best friends. Until I walked in on him fucking my mom. My parents divorced. I lost sight of my goals. Now I'm addicted to meth and I work the three a.m. Drive through shift at a fast food restaurant. In the ghetto. Kimmy. Ah. I wish my dick would just leave me alone.

You told your parents you hurt it simulating Mortal Kombat fatalities with your friends. Want me to keep going? You've had Chlamydia twice. You spray me with Curb Club before you go out for the night And. When you're bored You helicopter me around and make my hole talk like a little mouth. - All right that is enough. That's enough. - Which is embarrasing. Ok so just stop. - I don't know what happened. - Stop. The last thing I remembered is dangling between your legs But then I wake up in an alley in this morning. Naked. Like some God damned Terminator. And now, here I am on a piss smelling pay-phone asking you to pretty please pick me up before the fuckin' cops do. - You're naked? - As a poet's soul. Oh.

Smelled like a God damn UTI out there. Hi. I'm your dick. You have my eyes. We are related. Where's that grip I know? Just kidding. Did you bring the clothes? You brought your nut shorts? What? You jack off in these all the time because you're too lazy to get tissues. - Sorry. - Whatever. Let's get something to eat. I am fucking starving. No? What? I mean people don't just wake up without their dicks. I guess that makes you a pioneer. What happened? You've been blaming me for a lot of shit lately. So if I had to hypothesize, I would say that the universe got pissed off and decided to tilt the scale against you. And then they were like You know what? Fuck that scale. Lets just give it to him hard and raw. You don't think I feel the same way? I used to have my own private utopia. All I had to think about was napping, pissing and fucking. Now I'm dealing with hunger and thirst. I'm pretty sure I have to take my first shit soon. Oh. The worst part. Is that I've got my own dick, and it's not even as big as I was. Look at this! I should be able to hang a basket full of puppies off this. - Now I think I could barely handle one kitten. - Put it away. Please. Breaks my heart. I'm just saying I better be a grower Because I'm obviously not a shower. All right. All right. How do we fix it? Yea I know. So here's what I've been told. The next time Mercury aligns with Cancer at midnight on the next full moon some sort of vortex is gonna open up and we're just going to have to go through it together somehow. All right. All right. All right. When is the next, when is the next full moon? Are you fucking retarded? I just made that shit up. I don't know how to reattach. Shit, Shower, Shave? Oh.

[Zipper Zips] It's in your ass? No. No. It is in my apartment. That's good. You know where it is. Okay. It's a person. Fuck. What? My dick is an asshole. - He's brown? - No. White. - Is he bald? - No. - Chubby? - No. - Wrinked? - Would you shut the fuck up? Okay. I'm sorry. - What are you gonna do? - What can I do? Should I see a doctor maybe? Hell no. You'll be the new medical freak dejour. Kid with two heads. Kid with super strength. Man with no dick. If the government doesn't lock you in a lab then the talk shows will snatch you up. Turn you into a story of triumph that ends in tears of hope. Shit load of undeserved applause. You'd be like Carrot Top. Everyone will want a picture with you. But no one will want to have sex with you. Oh no. No no no. No. No! - Ahh! - The Fffftt? K. You ordered a hooker? Oh no. she's an escort. All right. And where is she escorting you to then? To "Bust a Nut-Ville". - All right you're gonna have to go. - Hold on! - I was so close! - Now. please. Go. Thank you. Damn. Not even a payment dispute. Oh no I gave her the TV in Rich's room. Super easy. Helped her load it right into her Scion before things got underway. Wait. You paid her with, you paid her with my TV? Um. Actually think the term is "Bartered". But, hey. I'm no English major. Ow! Fuck! Ow! Ow! C'mon! Okay. Listen to me. All right? If you're gonna stay here you're gonna have to control yourself. Yea. Oh. Okay. I'm so sorry dad. I didn't know I needed your permission for every little thing that I'm into. - Okay. A hooker is not a "little" thing. All right? - [Sighs] Listen. Okay? I'm trying to adjust right now. I've never had a body before. This all new to me. It's. Ho Ho. What? What? Oh my God. I just flexed my calf. A-mazing. That's really cool. That's cool. Okay listen. I messed up. I know that. But. What are you, you're not gonna yell at a toddler, right, for putting his hand on the stove? No you're gonna coddle him and you're gonna shower him with love. I'm sorry. I'm sorry I put my hand in the "Pussy Stove". All right? But right I need your help. Right? Not your wrath. Yea. I need to get you back. Eleven-Eleven. Go! I wish I had my dick back. I wish you had me back. - Oh you're still here. - Am I even? [Moaning] You're all out of cinnamon toast crunch. Fitness assessment? Excuse me? Are you my fitness assessment? I don't know. I had an appointment at two. All right. And what time is it now? - Almost two thirty. - Yea. No. That's probably me. Grab your stuff. So what are your fitness goals? Do you wanna live a healthy lifestyle? Or do you just wanna lose some fat around your ass, thighs and midsection for whatever insecure reason? Uh. Both I guess. Are you always this up front? No I'm usually pretty duplicitous. But I just don't give a fuck anymore. Yea. I don't feel anything. You're working your core. Look. I know you're probably getting paid smething like five dollars for our time together But. I'd apreciate it if you assumed I was going to sign up with you and put forth just like a tiny bit of effort. Are you going to sign up with me? Most likely not. Thats why I said "assume". There you go. You're human afterall. Yea. Sometimes. So am I. Which is why I really wanna squeeze into a size three for my sister's wedding in a couple weeks. Mhmmm. So that's the insecure reason. Well if you knew my sister you'd know why. Is she like, some tiny little blonde annoying thing? What are you? Psychic? No. No. I'm just really good at stereotypes. Well you nailed it. Shes a human Pomeranian. Bad. You gonna kick my ass or what? Um. Well you buy ten sessions from me and I'll give you the workout of your life. Thats extortion. I'm a personal trainer. It's what I do. How about I buy five, and I don't tell your boss that there's vodka in your protein shake? Yea. No Yea. That's good. Good and fair. Good. Whoooee! I'm fuckin' you up! - Only because you're first player. - You suck at second player. Oh. Hey man. We'll pick all this up. When? It looks like a freshman dorm in here guys. After we're finished smoking this marijuana cigar. So you're smoking weed now too huh? That's my fault. I didn't think it'd be a big deal. What are you even doing here? Emily found my Indian porn. You should put that in your antivirus folder. Cause that's what Rich does. - Okay. Five more mintes. All right. And Josh is going home and you will be vaccuming up the blunt guts off of my carpet. Yes. - No. But that's not enough time! He's right. That's a Dutch Master. It's gonna take at least ten minutes to burn. Maybe eight if you wanna get in on it. Five minutes is good. And there is one more thing, that I'm, gonna have to ask you to leave the toilet seat down. Why? You pissing out of your ass? Oh Shit. He's pissing out of his ass. Look. We're here for you man. We're gonna do everything we can to get things back the way they were. Isn't that right? Sure. See? Doesn't that give you confidence? Hey bud, Ive been playing with your dick all day. - Oh my God! Yea man! Whoa! - It is so mysterious! Oh. Ah. Ohhhh. Eh. She can't be older than twenty three, that kid is seven, He just doesnt stop. Wow. Looks like you've got your hands full. I know a great babysitter. Pretty cheap. If my dick came to life he'd probably be a lot more behaved. There's gotta be something I can do right? Someone I can appease. I mean, if the universe is keeping score, how the fuck can I earn points? - Oh my God that's it. - What's it? All right. This all started happening after I screwed things up with Jamie right? So if I can fix that maybe I can reverse everything. Thank you. Born again Christian bullshit. Where'd Rich go? [Doorbell Buzzes] Food's here! What the fuck? Uh. We didn't order seven-eleven. Baby you don't answer the door like that. Rich. What are you doing here? What the hell is this guy doing here? - Who are you? - Who are you? - Delivery for Jamie? - Yes Will you get the money baby? Sure little big penguin girl. I'm gone for a month and you're having sex with some like: - "Hey dude" - Yea What did you expect Rich? For me to sit around with my thumb up my ass lementing what could have been? We ran out of duck sauce so I put in extra soy sauce. Thank you. Seriously Rich. You let some girl gnaw on your penis like a number two pencil. I'm sorry about that. Okay? But I lost control. And people they lose control. No animals lose control. Is he comming back? Cause this is getting kind of akward. Chill out Tokyo Drift. I can say that. I mean we dated. We dated! - Yo babe. - Hm? I'm looking all over your purse and I cant find your money. It's in my wallet. Girls have wallets too? Blowin' my fuckin' mind right now babe! Okay. I - I want to make things better. - [Laughs] - Don't laugh. - That wasn't a laugh. That was an involuntary chest spasm. - Look. I loved you. - [Laughs] - You know if you would just give me another chance. - No. It's too late for that Rich. You know, in fact I'm really happy that you fucked things up. Now I'm having the sex of my life with a beautiful idiot who cant text without substituting numbers for words. It's amazing. I'm sorry. I. Wow. I shouldn't have come. Enjoy your Generals Chicken. - It's Broccoli Beef. Fuck you. One more. One more. Do you even know what one more means? "Baby Penguin Girl". Are you fucking serious? Look. I know you're going through some shit right now But I've had a long day of being nitpicked by my bitch of a boss. So I'd apreciated it if you could pretty please not be so God damn angsty. Yes. Yea. No I will try to do that. Sorry. I didn't mean for that to come off so harsh. It's fine. I think I actually needed that. - You wanna maybe grab some coffee after this? - Oh. Um. I don't think that's a good idea. - I didn't mean it like that. - How'd you mean it? Well not like that. Look. Um. You're an awesome trainer and all. And. And yea. You're kind of good looking. Um. I don't think you're my type. It's just I see the way you walk around here acting all "playery" pretending to scratch your abs so you can lift up your shirt and show off that "V" thing you've got going on. - Sometimes ya know I have an itch. - Every fourty seconds? All right. Lets do some trunk twists. Stand up. C'mon. Hey. Thanks for the pickup. But can you step on it a little bit? I've gotta meet up with this chick from OkCupid in like an hour. And she said to me "Hey. Tonight, if you want, you can put your P in my V". And I was like "eh." I'd rather put my C in your C. Right? [Brakes Screech] You get it? That was funny Oh! Shit! - What the fuck is your problem dude? - What is my problem? Ya know I put a roof over your head. Ok? I give you food to eat. And this is how you repay me. So right now might not be the best time to ask about getting an iPhone? No. - It would be so simple to just add to your family plan. - No! Okay. I am not going to put up with your shit anymore. Society is not going to put up with your shit. Okay? You need to straigten up and fly right. Or you can wander the streets with the hobos and the teenagers. You wouldn't kick me out. Try me. The free ride is over. - From now on you pay rent. - [Laughs] How the hell am I supposed to do that? Get a job. Fuck that. Who would even hire me? I've got enough THC in my blood to resurrect Bob Marley. You can stand in front of the hardware store with the illegals. You're about as much fun as a rubber. You know that right? Is anyone gonna hire us? Mhm. Fuck this. Next up is the lovely Shila. Place your bets. Pink or brown? Pink. Uh oh. She's Latina. This does not bode well for you my friend. Whoo! Brown. You owe me a beer motherfucker. Where'd you get all that money? Oh. You know. Rich's wallet. You're stealing from Rich? Actually I consider it more of an allowance. - Yea I should probably be getting home to Emily. - She's got you on a pretty short leash huh? I control the size of my leash. Oh. Like a big boy. Yea. Good for you. Yea well have you ever thought about severing it? No. I'm happy. Oh good. So you're having a lot of sex then. I'm having enough sex. Okay well no man who's getting his dick wet on a regular basis ever thinks it's enough. - You're bored. - No. That's it. you're bored. You've had too many trips to the same watering hole. Too many times playing that same video game. - Can we not talk about Emily? - You're the one who brought her up. Oh my God. What's your name? Josh. Sorry I don't have any money. Oh. I don't want your money. What do we have here? A little uh, slumdog elephant princess? - I'm Peruvian. - Okay. Same thing. Less hair. You should go. - Please let her stay. - You're so fucking cute. I don't normally get like this. - But there's just something about you. - I shouldn't be doing this. Of course you should. Feels good right? Yea. But I love Emily. My girlfriend. C'mon. Love is like a space heater. Yea it's good for a drafty corner but it's hardly the solution for an entire room. C'mon. I know you fantasize about other women. We all do. It's natural. So why don't you disarm that big ticking bomb in your chest and stop denying yourself the pleasures that you deserve? You deserve it baby. I can't. I can't. - C'mon. - I'm sorry. You're still gonna give me my three hundred right? Wait. What? Dude you set this up? - I prefer the term "Orchestrated". - Fuck you. He's not paying me. Okay. She's jumping to conclusions on that one. But Yea she is right. I'm not paying her shit. So. Hmmm. You guys have little kid bouncers here? Let's go out to the playground. That's so weird. Im bigger than you. I just wanna eat that little nose off your face. Oh yea. Whoo! He's the Antichrist. I mean I know he's bad but he's not Hitler bad. He could be. If he applied himself. What happened? He set me up to cheat on Emily. You cheated on Emily? No. No. Almost did. He is a persuasive motherfucker. I'm not blaming him.

You've already had more sex than most men will have their entire lives. Yea. And now I'm a Ken doll. And Ken is always smiling. You know why? He doesn't have to deal with the bullshit that every other man does. You gotta think about all the time you can devote to other things now that you don't have to worry about jacking off. Or hittin' on girls, or cheating on girls Your life just became a thousand times less complicated. You'll be able to get shit done. Hell you can write the great American novel. Yea but I don't want to write the great American novel. I want my fuckin' dick back. You don't need him back Rich. You have a chance to let your heart do the leading without any interference. It's like having two angels on your shoulder instead of one And a roided up devil. You're gonna be a better person for it. You just don't see it yet. You really think I'll be ok? I know you will. Everything happens for a reason. No don't say that. I fucking hate it when people say that. So do I. Hey come on let's go. Let's go. It's called a warm up not a beat down. Here we go. Here we go. I can increase my resistance on my own, thank you very much. You know I liked you a lot better before you got your Aderal prescription filled. It's like you're a completely different person. No no no. I'm not a person. I'm your player douchebag personal trainer. You're not a douchebag. We're doing legs today. You're a total douchebag. So what brought you out of your funk? Did you meet a girl? Romance her while watching The Notebook and fell madly in love? The Notebook? Please. I am a Princess Bride man. Uh uh. Inconceivable. - Not a Notebook fan either. Although... - Please do not say Ryan Gosling. Of course Ryan Gosling. But besides him, that kissing in the rain scene, Every girl wants to be kissed in the rain. Then maybe you should move to the Pacific Northwest. Maybe I will. Seriously though. Why are you so chipper all of a sudden? All right well this is gonna sound cliche, but, Gah, I was living my life one way and I realized that I just couldn't live it that way anymore. Sound like anyone who's ever been on Behind The Music. I know right? And I feel like I've been detoxing hardcore. From what? - Women. - Oh God. - This isn't some player angle is it? - No. God no. I'm not trying to play you. And I have no alterior motives. I'm not even gonna to try to get you to go out with me. Promise. I'm just gonna, help you reach your fitness goals in the least creepy way possible. In that case we should probably go for a drink tomorow night. What? Celebrate you being off your period. - Huh? - All right. All right. What were all the conflicts they taught us during emotion class? Man vs. Man, Man vs. Supernatural. Man vs. Nature, Man vs... - Himself. - Himself. Right. It's some tough shit. Did you get in an accident? Sure yea. Something like that. - You clean up nice. - Oh. Thanks. There we go. Don't Stop Believin'. Oh. No. You can't play Don't Stop Believing. Why not? Cause. You just can't. It's a universal bar rule. I like it though, so... I like it too. Hm. Everyone likes it. Then whats the problem? Well do you know how many people play that song? And then everytime it comes on everyone sings along but in the back of their mind they're thinking Gosh. Who is the dickhead that picked this? Me. Oh. Wow. Wow. Wow. Okay yea. Bartenders are going to hate me now. - Shut up or I'll play Tiny Dancer. - Ooo. I love you so much. Would you mind if we kissed? - Doug, stop. - C'mon just for a second. - I don't think we should. - I think it's okay. We try... - Leave me alone. - I'm sorry. Look I wasn't trying to hurt - Who are you? - Relax. I'm white. White? Goin home with Jill huh? Who's Jill? J-I-L-L. Jill? Hey sailor. Hey. What? Let me guess. You borrowed your dad's car, you broke the bank on dinner, You acted like an all around gentleman, and now Here you are wishing you would've just stayed home and jacked off. Yea how do you know that? That's a pain every man knows. You know, we're all about gettin' it in, they're all about keepin' it out That's why bullshit exists, all right? The greatest trick that a woman can ever pull is making a man think he's in love. That's how they gain control. Okay? You want my advice? Remain cold. Remain cold? Yea. Exactly. If she doesn't put out you go find someone who will. Because someone will. With a face like that Biceps like those, All right? - Okay. [Laughs] - I'll tell you right now, handholds and kisses, They're not worth time or money. Now. Get the fuck out of the car because I'm stealing it. Uh, yea. Uh what about that guy who puts his whole mouth on the water fountain? Oh the one with the uh, the camo bandana - and has the - Highly original barbed wire tattoo? Exactly. I can't fuckin' stand that guy. I mean you could like a dot to dot with his bachne. Thats probably the most discusting thing I've ever heard. You know what? Most girls that look like you, they're not usually.. Funny? Intelligent? Witty? I wasn't gonna say any of those things. Well yea. I wasn't always this effortlessly beautiful Effortlessly? I was that um, awkward, chubby alternative girl in high school with the bad skin and the pink rubber bands on her braces. Okay. Did you write the names of your favorite bands on your backpack with a whiteout pen? How did you know? Did the same thing. Eighth grade when I was going through my skater phase. - You were a skater? - Oh hell yea. Rocked the Jnco's and everything. Wow. I just, I had you pegged for the homecomming king with the blonde cheerleader girlfriend. Uh, that was senior year. Ok yea no never mind, I was right. Actually you know what? I was in a five year relationship. Believe it or not. This girl, Kimmy, and Wow, I even thought we were gonna get married but, What happened? Um, she cheated on me. If it's any consolation, I've been cheated on like, a dozen times. Yea no, It's probably the worst feeling in the world. To know that the person that you love Thought someone else was better. I just like to think that they had shitty taste, and that I was the exception. Like that guy at the bar over there. Don't look. I'm gonna look and pretend I'm looking past him at something else entirely. Ok. Be discreet. Yea. No he saw me lookin' right at him. We had like, a moment even. Did you see what he was drinking? Bud Light? Bud Ice. I know right? He's been sucking them back like there is no tomorrow. Except for his last beer. His last beer was an expensive micro brew. That's what we are. We're the expensive micro brews. That one beer that people have, don't apreciate, and then dump to go back to drinking cheap beer. Does that mean that we suck? No. It just means that we are not for everyone. Someone will come along. Make us the only thing they drink. So. I had a good time. So did I. You know I'm only doing this to get free sessions right? Oh no, I know. Your not gettin' em but it was, gosh, it was an inspired attempt. So. I mean should we hug? Or what? I don't know. I don't know. Shake hands maybe? Do something to say goodbye? Oh like say goodbye? Yea no, that works. We could friend hug. You know one good squeeze and then a pat. Squeeze and pat? Perfect yea. Yea. Suck that. Keep it consistent. Yea, don't stop. Oh wait. No. No fancy tongue shit. No. What happened? You went limp. Totally wasn't a friend hug. Where is that piece of shit? Baby I love you okay? Oh shit. So listen I was getting some head last night and I felt something I havent felt for a while. You know that, warm feeling where you care less about sex and more about love? So here's your job right now. You need to answer: Is our dickless friend puppy doggin' it with someone? Hm? What? Oh shit. Did I hit you too hard? Ah I guess I'm gonna have to go straight to the source. This is not good. He says he can feel you. Well, Good. Good. I hope I'm distracting him as much as he used to distract me. I dunno man. I think you set him off with that girl. You think he's losin' power or somethin'? I haven't been fucked up in a parking lot since I tried to pursue a career in MMA. Whatever it is, he's pissed. He deserves it. All right? You were right. I'm better off without him. What are we doing? It's a surprise. If this is a surprise, I'm surprised it sucks so much. - I'm just kidding. - No. I know. It's not that. What is it? I can't tell you. Cmon. You hit like a baby kangaroo. All right. So you know how you always, you kow how you said you, always wanted to kiss in the rain? Well Weather.com said, Should be raining, right now. You brought us out here to kiss in the rain? No not kiss. Make out passionately. I don't know what to say. Well you could say, uh, Fuck you weather.com - Hey whats wrong? - Nah. Nothing. Why? It's just that guys usually don't pull away when girls take off their pants. I just, you know, I wanna take things slow. That's all. I'm sorry, I.. I'm not ready. This is Lindsay, again. Look, I don't know what the hell is going on but this is really fuckin' lame. - Maybe he had an outbreak. - That's gross. Well why else would he reject you? A guy turning down sex is like a dog turning down chocolate. It just doesn't happen. He said he wasn't ready. Seriously? That's our line. That's not his. If he's not calling you back, screw him. You can do a lot better than a personal trainer. There's like billions of them. - It's just I wanted to take him to my sister's wedding too, and - Katie Cambell, is that you? Oh my god it's been years. - Excuse me? - Oh my God. I'm so sorry. I thought you were one of my classmates from Oxford. Nah. I went to school here in state. I feel even stupider now because I just realized that you guys look nothing alike. You're much prettier than she was. She's single. Oh. Really? I mean, maybe I should stick around and flirt a little bit then. - I'm just kidding, um, not really - Would you like to join us? - Yea. If um, - Linday. If Lindsay doesn't object. Please. So. Is that Lindsay with an A, or Lindsay with an E? A. I knew it. A Lindsays always put E Lindsays to shame. That's a fact. I'm R.P. by the way. Hi. - Hi I'm Samantha. - Samantha? - Yea. Why aren't you gorgeous? So what do you do R.P? Actually, kind of a, kind of a mouthful. Um, I am the international coordinator for a number of charities worldwide. Oh wow. Do you have a favorite? They're all equally rewarding, I'd say in their own way. But We did just do a pants drive for the torso foundation. I've not heard of that one. It's a charity. It's for people that have lost the lower halves of their bodies. Boating accidents and tumors. Stray cables in amusement park rides. But, Watching them come together and donate their old pants really puts things in perspective. Ya know. Maybe I'm sappy but I guess you don't need a pair of legs to walk a mile in someone else's pants. Anyway I feel stupid. I have a confession. There is no Katie Cambell. I didn't know how to come over and say hi to you. I'm sorry. Oh you lied because you were nervous? That is so cute. Isn't that so cute Lindsay? Yes I do love an honest liar. Wow. If you let me take you out to dinner I'd lie to you all night. Honestly. All right. So Lindsay, I don't know how to tell you this but, My penis is gone. Penis is M.I.A. My penis is gone on definite haitus. Hello? Whaddup Kid? What do you want? You can't say whaddup back? Whaddup? Oh you know just gettin' more ass than gay Latin men. Haven't you felt it? Uh no I haven't. Oh that's wierd because I've been feeling you getting all lovey dovey - I figured you'd be feelin' me gettin' all bust a nutty. - What do you want? I was gonna call and invite you to dinner tomorrow night. I'm gonna be down at the Bougie Fondue place down in Armitige. Ya know it looks pretty low key but Kind of expensive. Sorry I'm gonna have to pass on that. You're not gonna wanna do that. - And why is that? - Ahh there in lies the fun. You're just gonna have to trust that I've got something mind blowing for your ass. You're probably gonna wanna put it in your memoirs. And don't even think about not showing up because I will make your life suck harder than the W.N.B.A. I'll make sure the whole world knows you're packin' a blank canvas. You wouldn't. Uhh. Actually, yea I would. So holla back bitch. I haven't told you how beautiful you look tonight. Thank you. Don't thank me. I said that I haven't told you. Do you know why? Why? Because I can't find the words to express how beautiful you look. Um, you know you don't need to spit game, I'm already having dinner with you. I'm not spitting game. I am just like Grenade launching it everywhere I can. Like me. Please. You're kind of a dork you kow that? - Is that a bad thing? Or - No Not at all. It's better than not being a dork. I'm kind of a late bloomer. Kind of comes with the territory. So I'm gonna run to the bathroom. And then when I come back I will be initiating light contact. Just wanna warn you. And it might come from under the table. Oh my God. Rich? What? No. No no no no no no. You stay the fuck away from her okay? I'm sorry do I know you? - Don't play that shit with me. I am not scared of you. - Rich. What are you doing here? He told me to come. I have never seen this guy in my life. Bull shit. Bull shit. Bull shit okay. He is my... Your what? Your what? Nothin'. Nothing. - No. What were you you going to say? - Yea what? Nothin'. He's my doppleganger. Oh that's really sad. I've heard about a mental illness Shut up okay. Lindsay, you have to listen to me okay? You want to stay away from this guy. He's [Gasping] - Oh shit. - Oh my God. That guy had no dick. Wow. Very odd. - Sorry about everything that happened tonight. - Don't be. It's not your fault. I just can't believe that he had nothing down there. I mean do you think that it's like a birth defect or a cancer thing? Don't know. Why would the bus boy just pull down his pants like that? I think bus boys just have a sixth sense about bad people. You kow? Kind of like animals. Is something going on between you two? I don't know whats going on. I mean obviously I have no idea what happened between you two I'm guessing it has something to do with the fact that he's got an anchor for sale and he's batshit crazy but It's not my business. I'm not one to judge. I just don't wanna interfere with anything so... If you want me to back off I totally understand. No. It's fine. You sure? I like you. Sorry, sounds like a, Wanna go on a picnic this saturday? Can't. My sister's getting married. Oh no shit. Well congratulations to her. - Open bar? - Oh yea. Nice. You know no government recognized life long commitment is complete without copious amounts of alcohol. Tell me about it. Do you maybe wanna come with me? What? Like be your date? Oh not at all. I'll be buzzed and flirting with you, with the romantic backdrop of a wedding? Of course I wanna go with you. - Fuck a picnic. - Great. - See you Saturday then? - Saturday it is. Oh I'm sorry. No that's okay. I know it's not me. My confidence is still intact. So I'll just be handsome for you on Saturday? Who is that? Is that.. Gotcha anyway. Hello it's Lindsay. [Laughs] Just kidding. Leave a message. Not here. Two hundred and seventy nine missed calls. That's a new stalker record. - Give me back my phone. - No I won't. I'm holding onto this for your own good. Cause the sooner that psycho is out of your life the better. - He's not a psycho. - Lindsay he doesn't have a dick. He could be Nick Carter from the Backstreet Boys circa 1999 and I'd still be like: Kick him to the curb. You can't be with somebody that you can't have sex with. All right? He doesn't have a dick. Lindsay? No, but I did make her face look like a Cinnabun last night. You mother fucker. Where are you? I am at a payphone somewhere. Actually I don't know how I keep finding these things. - Where's Lindsay? - Oh. Don't worry about her. She's home safe right now. She's recovering. So that uh, That birthmark on her right hip, that didn't bother you? Nope. Reverse side cowgirl. All night. Didn't have to see one deformity. Yea ya know she doesn't have a birthmark. Oh. Ok. Fine. great. You got me. But you're still a bitch. And she's still an inevitability. We're going to a wedding this weekend together. Weddings are pretty condusive to penetration. Are you really calling me just to talk shit? Right. I just can't call and talk shit? I thought you knew me better than that. But no. I called to tell you that girlfriends are for guys who can't get pussy. And you're just trying to blow up right now because you're no longer a force on the fuck circuit. So I suggest that you don't or I will find whoever you fall for and I tear them up like a losing scratch off. Save yourself some pain, and uh, call it a life. Hello? Hi. I was just calling to say that I just found your dog Rusty. Are you serious? Thank heaven. Baby! They found Rusty. They got Rusty! I'm just fucking with you guys. I don't know where the hell your dog is. I don't think this is a battle you can win. Drian said the exact same thing to Rocky Right before he fought Drago. Rocky's a retard. - He blocks with his head. - Rocky has heart. So did Rudy and everyone knew not to give that motherfucker a chance. Look. This isn't about me anymore okay. This is about Lindsay. And I will be God damned if I let my dick have his way with her. How are you going to stop him? Well... No. No Rich. I am not getting involved. Not. God damn it. Why are you so charming? I'm having a great time with you. Oh. I'm having fun too. I was worried it might be a little weird. Yea. I sense that. But all that matters is you're having a good time. By the way I've got a wonderful evening planned for us. You have an evening planned for us? Yea no. We're gonna be leaving here shitfaced. But regardless I thought It'd be nice to ride high on the sentiment of the day. That, and I have a giant middle school crush on you. Proper girl in the hat just eye fucked the shit outta me. Do not quote Wedding Crashers. We're crashing a wedding. - Why can't I quote Wedding Crashers? - Because. It's played out. Oh hey. This is my uncle Bob. Oh. It's a pleasure. - My aunt Judy. - Judy. Very lovely. Bob you dog. This is my little cousin Gabby. Oh. Well hello there. Gabby. Wow. Aren't you gonna be hot when you get older. Please remember me? Yea. She still beleives in Santa. Who want's more champagne? Right there. There they are. All right. Did you bring it? It's right here. What would I do without you? Hey I'm gonna get some, hit the, head. Um, is what I meant to say. You good? Excuse me, could you slip this to that girl right over there? Um. Excuse me. But do I look like a fucking messenger? "Meet me at Schiller's Statue." Oh. What the fuck is this? Oh no wait. Let me guess. You want to get her alone So you can profess your undying love for her And then steal her away from the guy she's with. Oh that is so fucking original, really. And you know what though? I really don't wanna be a part of that. So I'm gonna tell you what. Judging from your behavior, you seem like a major creeper, which is probably why she doesn't wanna be with you. And you know what? I wouldn't want to be with you either, and you are normally my type. But I'm gonna tell you something. I'm not gonna tell on you cause that is bad, fucking, karma. But I am gonna strongly suggest, that you sir, get outta here. Thank you. So much. Wow. Excuse me. Could you hand this to that girl right over there? Sure. Excuse me Miss. This is for you. Thank you. Please. Don't freak out. I can't promise anything. I know I'm in no position to explain myself and I'm not even gonna try. Okay? I just came here because I want to show you something, and that is all. And you look fabulous in that dress by the way. Thanks. I have a good trainer. Yes you do. All right. Right here. Damn girl. You shouldn't be eye fucking the shit outta me if you're gonna make me work like this. - What the hell is this? - Lindsay. Rich? I guess you do know me. This isn't what it looks like. If it looks like he was all over me trying to get me to blow him, then yea it is what it looks like. Please don't say that again. I'm sorry. You're the one who made me do this. Rich is lucky I love him so much. - Thank you Emily. - You're welcome Rich. I'm taking you home and bathing you in Pine Sol. I was drinking. She started comming onto me. I was telling her to stop. I was pushing her away and she just kept comming at me. He set this up. Excuses. Excuses. Lindsay, please. It's gonna be like that? No. No. No. I can't let you guys get all toughy feely. Oh. Hey officer. We're fine. - Let go of me you asshole. - You forgot to say please. There's a bomb strapped to us. There's a bomb. The cake always gets destroyed baby. Don't act surprised. Help! We're just role playing. There's no need to be alarmed. No ones gonna help you. Why are you doing this? What? You don't like being kidnapped? I'm messing with you. Me and Rich. We go together like corn-rows and crime. Unfortunately that pesky little heart of his could fuck up my very existence. So it goes down to the whole Darwinian thing I was hoping you'd fall for me but since it's not looking like we're gonna be smelling each other's farts anytime soon, I'm just gonna amke sure you don't fall for Rich. And I think it's hard to fall for someone if you're falling off a building. [Screams] Did anyone see a girl being kidnapped? This part of the role playing too? No it's not, roleplaying. - God. You're not the lightest thing are you? - I'm a size three. Asshole. Where? Old Navy? It's a pity things didn't work out. Tonight was gonna be amazing. I was gonna cuddle you and love you and romance you and then stretch you. Hope I get a refund on that room. Fingers crossed right? All right. Where'd she go? Where'd she go? Where'd she go? There she is. There she is. Stay the fuck away from me. Just come look at the view with me please. Oh. Fuck. [Laughing] Whoo. That was so fuckin' meta. Ah. Shit. You Again. You're like gum on a fuckin' shoe. You need to stay away from her. Why? So you guys can just go ride off into the sunset and grind your crotches together? - Eh, I don't think so. - You're getting weaker. Aren't you? I mean thats why you just, you can't Leave us alone? Wow. You are so brilliant. You fuckin' cracked the code man. What the hell are you talking about? He is, he's not, my doppleganger. Okay? He... He's my penis. Don't think about it too hard darling. It's Pretty complicated. - No nope no no no. - Look, I'm not leaving without her. Oh ok well uh, then you're not leaving. Hey you wanna know why I am who I am and he is who he isn't? Because he can't behave himself. He's cheated on every single girlfriend that he's ever had. - That is not true. - Oh. Okay. How about I tell a little story then. So... Rich dated this girl Kimmy for about what, five years? She was perfect actually. Anyway she took a heavy shit on his heart by sleeping with somebody else Which is... actually pretty sad huh? Except, he cheated, on her. A few times. And nobody knew it. Not even his little fuckin, butt body Josh. And then he likes to blame their failure on her cold ways when the reality is that he was fucking around, the whole time. Look. Things are gonna be different. Haven't you figured it out yet Rich? As long as I'm here, It's always gonna be the same. No. It's not. Okay. I blamed you for a lot of things in the past. Okay I made excuses. But I am stronger than you. Okay It's my fault for never saying no. I mean, I was a shitty person. Simple as that. And I know, I know I can't Be with her and give her what she needs, and that sucks, and it hurts. But, That's not what this is about. This is about, Keeping her away from someone like you. - Well let's test that resolve. - Let's. Is that all you've got? You used to jerk me off harder than that. You got short legs. You can't do it. I've got long legs. Oh okay. Whoa. All right. Game changer. A little cyanide? Good yea. Right now is a perfect time to end it. No this is for erectile dysfunction. You gonna stiffen me up? That's not gonna work. We're about to find out. Okay? It's that gun that's just out of reach. Here you wanna graze it? Here you go. Just give it a little graze with those fingertips. Yea. Oh great. Now we gotta wait an hour and a half for them to take effect. These are one fifties. Yea. Whew. Yea. They are good. I feel fucking good. You gettin' fucked up son. Remember me? Bitch slap, bitch slap, bitch slap, pimp pimp. I like you better when you're a damsel in distress. Whew. Where's he gonna go? [Screaming] No. Wait. Please. Get up please. Probably shouldn't have my back to him. Can you do me a solid and let me know if he's commin' up? Fuck you. Oh thank you. Oh. You wanna go another round? Okay. I win. We got him. Here we go folks. Got you a little blanket. Oh thank you. It's like 70 degrees out here so, we don't need a blanket. Thank you for saving me. Sure yea. I mean I'm gonna have to bill ya for a few extra training sessions. But, Shut up. All right look. So, I know, that I'm not all there, so to speak. But, Hey. I wanna make it work too. Yea? What? Rich. Oh my God. What? Oh yes! Oh I own you bitch. Where's the perp? He's gone. He vanished. Like Yoda. He did a slow fade into nothin'? No. Just the blink of the eye. Ok then it's not like Yoda. Because Yoda faded away. Right. Oh, my god. Sorry. - Really? - Sorry. Sorry. Yea. All right look. Wow. Now that he's back, Okay. I can't promise that, I won't look. But, I can promise one hundred percent, that I will be good. I'll just have to keep you occupied then. Yea. Works.
