I have some very nice people working for me. Nico is a salesman, and he's very ambitious. And Stella is very talented. It's a great deal! Wussy is a mechanic and good at talking with people. He has an apprentice, Allan. - That'll be 8,300... - This doesn't fit. Torben is our other mechanic, and he can't wait for December. This is my beautiful daughter, Amalie, and our bookkeeper, Frans. Bulldog is the foreman and entirely indispensable. And this is me. Holger. But our story starts somewhere else. It starts with this fellow, Anders Bo. He's new in town, so I don't know him yet. Hillsville advertising: Are you among the 3% who still aren't Mastodont clients? Right now there's a welcome bonus for you. A pair of fashion-forward XXL Mastodont boxers. Because here at Mastodont, size does matter! Young man, you can't park there. Customer parking is over there. I'm here for a job interview. Job interview? Is that today? Hello. - Are you here for the interview? - No, we're here for the free lunch. - So this is the waiting room? - Well, duh! Have you ever seen more than one person at a job interview? Smartass. Gentlemen. I'm in a rush, so we'll do a joint job interview. Fantastic idea. Brilliant move, Mr. Ejlerskov. Gunnar, could you water the plants some other day? - I'm here for thejob. - You're a gardener! Yes, and didn't I do a good job on the new bushes out front... Goodbye, Gunnar. Okay, thanks for giving me a shot at it. So, which one of you desires the job the most. - That would be me! Nico Holm. - Easy now, junior. All that matters to us is dedication. You, there! Would you swallow your hat to get the job? - You mean, eat it? - Well? - I'll do it! - No. I hate Christmas anyway. Out! Get lost, Jinglebells. I need men who'll jump out the window if I ask them to. Are you okay down there? - Do I have the job? - What do you think? Super, Patrick! You won't regret it! I'll come right up! Never mind him. He applies every year. You, however! You have an impressive CV. Your name? - Anders Bo. - Welcome. Just don't give me an office too high up. - Hi, Mom. - Did you get the job? - Yes, and I brought you flowers. - Yeah, yeah. Wonderful. I found you a girlfriend, and I've set the wedding date. - How about May 31st? - It doesn't work like that... Wait till you see little Karen. Everyone gets visits from grandchildren but me. - Not even one. - You rang, Gerda? Oh, little Karen. Yes, look at this. - Anders Bo brought you flowers. - They're for you, Mom. - Don't be shy. - Gerda has told me lots about you. - Well, then. Here you are. - Are they really for me? How sweet! Tell him I'm fed up talking about it. I want to buy his shop now! Tell him to name his price. Patrick Ejlerskov wants to wrap this up. Asap! And with this. What a nice pen, Patrick! - Are you totally clueless? - Are you tota... - Do you mean me? - No! Say it to him! Patrick Ejlerskov asks if you understand. That's not what I said, airhead! - Was that meant for me? - Yes! Are you clueless, too? - More coffee? - Coffee? Let me tell you what I want. I want this and this and this. This and these and this. I want it all! Do you get it? - I'm done with the two cars. - That was quick. Thank you so much, Bulldog. - Do you need me in here? - No, no. We're just small-talking. Bulldog is amazing. I don't know what I'd do without him. Why won't he sell when he gets to name the price! - Your dealbroker pen didn't work. - Give me that! - What shall I do with this? - How should I know! Get rid of it! - Get going! - Yes. Holger! Holger! Ah! A man who looks beyond the price. If you don't return it within 30 days - - we'll send an invoice and a bottle of champagne. - Didn't you forget something? - Of course. Your boxers. - Drive safely. - Thank you. You wanted to see me? Do you see the difference? That building isn't on the blind. Exactly. It's Holger's Auto, and I hate the sight of it! - It can't possibly be a rival. - I don't care! - Then buy it. - I want the pathetic place shut down. That's where you come in. As it happens, Holger's Auto is looking for a new foreman. It's right up your alley! Oh yeah, that's 100% driving joy! Let's shake on it. Well, Nico. I hear the Christmas party is tonight. Sounds awfully nice. Yeah, I'll be charging overtime after 6. Stella, will my car be done today? We'll sure do our best, Johannes. Have a little eggnog while you wait. It'll go on your invoice, so no harm done. Wow, that's pretty strong stuff. You'll have quite a party tonight. It's Bulldog's recipe. - Guys, would you come in here? - Coming. Good! We're all here. Where's Frans? Why does he never have to do anything? - Would you fetch him, please? - I'm right here. - I was here the whole time. - Very good, Frans. Let's find our Christmas spirits! We'll decorate and have fun like every year. I'd like to point out that it's costly - - to have someone like me do something like this. Yes, and we know you'll do your extra best. You and Stella can start on this. And Torben and Wussy, you start on that? - Hello! What about you? - I have job interviews with Holger. Uh, did you get any responses to the ad? Yes! Yes...? It'sjust that... Torben is very excited about the job interview. Right? - Don't! - Aren't you? - So, Bulldog won't be foreman again? - Time will tell? Right, Bulldog? Wussy, I didn't realize we still had all this stuff. It's hard to get rid of. No one wants to pimp their ride anymore. Ah, Wussy. I'll have a go at it. Welcome to Holger's Auto. What can we do for you? - I'm here for a job interview. - Have a seat. - Eggnog to sweeten the wait? - No, thank you. Uhm... Johannes? How would you like to feel young again? I'm sure Elsa would appreciate it. You know what? I havejust the offer for you! - Do you know what 'pimping' is? - Sure! But I don't think Elsa would like that line of work. Why did you advertise the job, when you know that I want it? You're a great mechanic, but you're always late. - I don't think managerial work is you. - If Holger can do it, so can I. Ha! He's got a point. Well, you tend to become somewhat defensive. I do not! It might affect your ability to solve conflicts. That's the stupidest thing I've ever heard! What?! I'm here for an interview. - Didn't you learn to knock? - You didn't hear me. No, that... may be so. And no one here likes your defensive speech! Wow! How pathetic! - Torben! - He just burst in! This has given me an in-depth knowledge of every single car brand - - and sharpened the managerial skills needed to run a business like yours. - My-my. You've been around. - But he's way too young. He may have 'been around', but he's only in his early 30s. - So? You're only 40. - We're talking repair shop years! - They're like dog years. - That's not what it's about. - You lose your temper at times. - What do you mean? When your team lost? You were gone for 4 months. It was an umpire error! But they were repair shop months. - How about your playmate calendar? - 3 months went missing! April, May... and do you remember November, Holger? Torben, you are somewhat unstable, but we care for you... Thank you! And this guy's flawless, perhaps? - But you're not always punctual. - That's a lie. I leave at exactly 4 every day! Yes! That is correct. 4 on the dot. Jesus, Frans, Let us know you're here! I've been here the whole time. It's not my fault. Frans... This is very difficult. They seem equally qualified to me. Let's ask Bulldog! It's his old job, after all. - Yes, let Bulldog decide. Great idea. - Are you sure about that, Dad? Yes! Bulldog, should Torben or Anders Bo have the job? - Huh? - Alongside you, of course! Gunnar. - His name is Anders Bo. - Gunnar! Why is he calling me Gunnar? It's on your overall. - 'Gunnar'. - My nickname. - What an odd nickname. - It'sjust an ordinary name. Aha. Gunnar, thejob is yours. Congrats on the job! You already look like them. - I look like your gardener. - Exactly. In return I brought you this. - Is that for me? - Yes, and so is this office. - In 2 years, I'll be in your office. - Well-well. It feels bigger in those, doesn't it? Wow! Is that your girlfriend? - Would you consider lending her out? - It's my mom. I bet she's a hot granny. It's better when they can take out their teeth. She's a widow, and as I said... my mother. Right. You're in, and the party tonight is the perfect opportunity to get hold of - - their client list. You resign on Monday, and nobody's the wiser. - The good old in-and-out. - I'm seeing my mom. Talk about good old in-and-out! Listen, without clients, Holger's Auto will shut down. Let's say I mind your mom tonight, and you work your magic at Holger's. - You'll go see my mom? - We scratch each other's backs here. Allan has given it a first-class work-over, and it's top-notch now. Do I really need all this? - I think you're in for some action. - Action? If the little Mrs. likes the car, she may invite you into the moth hole tonight. - Moth hole? - Yes, you know... Uh, or maybe you don't. Elsa will love this, Johannes. Then it'll be worth every penny. Thank you. Burn some rubber! - Does he need all that? - You're obviously a mechanic. Drive safely. It's good to be home. Elsa! The car's ready. Well, if it isn't the new foreman. Gunnar! What a surprise. So, your mom let you come to the Christmas party after all? What a way to start a new job. Your mom sounds amazing. - That's what she said! - What? Uh... Cheers, Holger. Allan is a great kid. He knows everybody. Hi, Torben. It's funny to think that before you were here, Holger - - before you were here, Wussy, before all this was here... ... this rock was here. And when we're no longer here, and all of this is no longer here... ... this rock will still be here. I find that an intriguing thought. We'd better get this show on the road, then. - How does all this make you feel? - I'm fine. I'm fine, Wussy, and I think we're all very, very fine. Hey, here comes Wussy's wife. Woohoo, shake that booty, baby! - Polina? - Yes. What are you doing here? Invited? By whom? No, Allan! No! Hi, Polina! Hi! Anders Bo. Hi. - No! - Bulldog! - What's up with him? - I think it's his way of saying hello. The party's here! Shall we get it over with? So! You thought you could be the new salesman at Mastodont? When in fact you'rejust a mechanic. It was worth a shot. It's like I always say: Aim higher. Aim for the stars. As I recall you hit the ground. Yeah... I think I left my eggnog over there. - I'm sorry! - Hi. - Shall I close the door? - No thanks. I suffer from a fear of confined spaces. Could you hand me some tissue? I'll probably need it. Just put it on my thigh. Thank you. Welcome everyone to our grand Christmas party. I made the food, and there's something for everyone. Spiced herring for Torben, pickled eggs for you, Wussy - - spareribs for you, Bulldog, chicken legs for Allan - - curry bratwurst for you, Stella and fish fingers for Nico. - Sirloin for Dad. - Thanks, sweetie. I hope Anders Bo and Polina like... I have something Polina will like! I didn't know you'd be here, but the rest of you get your favourites. - Did I forget you, Frans? - Yes. But it's okay. Yes. Bulldog, here you go. No, you don't like salad, Bulldog. No! It's for me. This is for you. - Eat this first, okay? - Bulldog! - Huh? - That's what she said! - Where do you come from? - I was born here. - But Dad moved me to Copenhagen. - So, in a way you've come home? - Do you still know people here? - My mom's at Shady Oakes. I was supposed to see her tonight. - Pork, pork and more pork! - Your fish fingers are right there. Where's the caviar and champagne? I thought this was a party. - I think it's delicious. - I'm just calling a spade a spade! If you can't see this buffet lacks stature, you're in the right place. - Is he always like that? - No, he's usually quite obnoxious. I heard that Mastodont hired some fancy salesguy from Copenhagen. - Copenhagen! How lame is that? - Pretty lame. For 2 years I've been waiting for an opening at Mastodont. - I think you did great. - Thank you. - Where did you work before? - Not in Copenhagen! - What do you mean? - In Ringsted. At Verner's. Then you must know that old fart Bjarni! No, I don't think so. He must've started after I left. No, he's been there for 20 years, ever since he left Iceland. - Bjarni! - Ah! That Bjarni! Sure, I know him. - Goddam, he's messed up. - He sure is. We were so many guys at Verner's, so... No, there's just the two of them. Right... but he's not the kind'a guy one remembers. Isn't he wearing the eye patch anymore? - I gotta pee. Wanna hold it for me? - Funny. Dear, everyone. I am feeling... ... very, very, very poorly. I'm sorry but I must leave. - So early? - Yes. - We're not even pissed yet! - Frans, you hardly ate anything. No, but... I'm sure you'll be fine without me... yes. - You got that last part right! - Nico! This is a Christmas party. Ah, come on. Can't the guy take a compliment? Don't tell anyone you saw me. I've gone home. - Okay. - It's a surprise. - No one must know I'm here. - I don't think that'll be a problem. No. - Besides, I'm leaving now. - Okay. Gunnar? What happened here? - I just needed a pencil. - Don't tell me you're working! - Yes! I just couldn't wait. - Oh! Do you need anything else? - The client register, perhaps? - You won't find that here. It's all filed up here, alongside the serial number of a Porsche 944. Do you have a 944? Now that you ask, I'm suddenly not sure... But I had a Mazda. Great ride! Perhaps a client register would be a good idea? - See you Monday. - You're leaving now?! Yes... oh, Right! The Christmas party, of course! - Go on. - Cheers. - Hey! How about a body shot? - It's Danish culture at its best. A new experience, Polina? Save me some onions, Nico! - Can I lick off the rest? - What a great time you're having! Well, now... You want a piece of Nico Holm? You should taste the best part of me. Polina, you naughty Polish pixy! I'm willing to share my goodies. - I wish I had a little bitch like you. - What are you saying, Torben? Oh, I mean, a little bitch like yours. Oh, right. This is all just a part of being Nico Holm. - How does all this make you feel? - Stop it! That job should've been mine. So that my dad could see that little Torben was good for something. But then he went and died on Tuesday. The twit. You haven't said anything about that, Torben! Why would I? - But, how does that make you feel? - Don't! - Tell me! - No, we all have our ups and downs! Well, for me it's mostly down these days. I'm just no good. - How does that make you feel? - Goddammit, that's enough! If I want to talk, I'll let you know! You damn well have to respect that. - I do, Torben. - Fine. Move over, Nico. I'm the dessert! All that food! Throw in 4 tiers, and call it a Christmas offer. - It'll sell like hotcakes. - Stella, we can't sell old food! - I finished it! On both sides! - You're such a good boy. If you want to make me really happy, you'll have a little more. - Uhm... does he have a girlfriend? - I don't think so. - Are you still at my mom's? - You know what? Driving Miss Daisy is her favourite film, too! It's probably his mom. He was seeing her tonight - but he came here instead. Then a Christmas bang might be in the cards. - Stella! - If you don't, I will. He memorizes them? That's pathetic! What if he dies? You've gotta pick his brains! - How am I supposed to do that? - Think! I gotta go. Hi! Why don't we take these leftovers to your mom? - A sweet idea, but I don't think so. - Sure, come on, Anders Bo. She's got plenty of company, and we have our party here. - Besides, you can't drive now. - Sure. Come on. Come on. Holger... - Am I a good salesperson? - Oh, you want to charge me for this? - Stella, you could sell anything. - Yes, that's the thing, you see. Did Wiener Walther really need that off-roader for his hotdog stand? It was brilliant! He can sell hotdogs in the Alps now, if he wants to. - And Tina Michelle's student loan? - Well, there is that... But she'll be the only nurse with an 18-foot house trailer. Give Bulldog a hand with the beer, please. And stop worrying! It'll be fine! Here they are. Now that Stella is helping Bulldog, maybe Bulldog can help Stella? - Bulldog slaps Stella, yes? - No. Stella helps Bulldog, Bulldog helps Stella. Right here. Come on! Again. Wait here a minute. I'll check to see if she's sleeping. - Hi! - Did Patrick leave? Look what he brought me! - Hi, Anders Bo. How's it going? - Patrick. - Mom, what are you doing? - You have a wonderful mother. Anders Bo? May I come in? - Yes, come on in! - Do you have something for me? - Hi. - Hi. I'm Amalie, I work with Anders Bo. We brought you dinner. Look. What a surprise. Are they real rinds? Karen always boils them. Our teeth, you know... - Mom, we've gotta go. - I need to use the restroom. - No! The toilet... is broken. - It's broken? Yes. Anders Bo! I thought I heard your voice. Amalie, did you meet Anders Bo's girlfriend? - What are you talking about? - Little Karen. - Hi. Are you two a couple? - No, not at all. - The toilet is working again. - We really should go. I'm sorry, Tina Michelle! I'm sorry, Wiener Walther! Say I'm a bad girl! I'm a bad girl. Okay, Bulldog, let's try again, but this time with this. That's much better. Here. Let it rip! Punish me. What's it like to return home after so many years? It feels right. I've never been away for longer than a weekend. - Because Holger needs you? - Yes. He broke down when my mom ran away with another man. He came out of the blue. Some Dutch guy in an air balloon. - A balloonist? - Yes. If you asked Holger, he'd let you travel the world a thousand times. Probably not in a balloon, though. Look at that auto company. Mastodont. - Impressive, don't you think? - I don't know... - They're not my style. - Because they're the competition? No, because there should be room for everyone. I don't want to talk about it. Oh, yeah! Yeah! Oh, yeah. Stop! Stop, yeah! No, no. Don't stop! Come on! Punish me! Punish me! Stop! Oh, stop! Listen, Bulldog! When I say 'stop', you must keep hitting me. Bulldog stops! - Oh, yeah, stop! Stop! - Bulldog stops! - Holger! - Hi there. I just came down to tell you that we're about to sing. - Yes. - Like we always do. Bulldog helps Stella. - Yes. And Stella helps Bulldog, I see. - Holger, we'll be right up. - Bulldog. - Bulldog stops! Oh, stop! Yeah. Good, Bulldog! Christmas is here Christmas is here and we will party on forever for we cannot stop, no we cannot stop and if you ask us we say 'Never'! For we cannot stop, no we cannot... Holger! Holger! Hello! Hello? Come on, Torben. Come! Hello! Hello! Holger! Stop, stop! Whoah... - That's enough, Torben. Come on. - Where are we going? - Join us! - I'm way too busy. Go on, Torben! You always join in. We can't have a party without games. - You can win one of my brandies! - Big spender! A bottle of $20 booze. - Why not throw in a kiss from Amalie? - Great idea! - Dad... - Awesome. - I'll get my camera, if Polina wins! - No, Allan. She's not into that stuff. Girl on girl action! It's ripe for the internet. Let's just say that I'll kiss the winner, if he or she wants me to. Go, girls! Go, girls! What would I do without them? Not least, Amalie. Go, girls! Go, girls! - Your clients must mean a great deal. - Oh, yeah. Without them, no party. - Who's your biggest client? - Let's not talk about work. - You win! - Bulldog wins every year! Look now. Go! Ready, set, go! - All set! - Right on! Yeah, man! I'll goddamn hit you where it hurts! Die motherfucker! - I did it! Yeah, man! - You're supposed to hit her, Nico. - What are you doing? - Its aim is off! Are you using December as target? No! She's just a platinum blonde from the block! Not half bad. Your turn, Bulldog. Okay! Anders Bo and Bulldog have one point each. Whoever gets the next point is the winner. I'll hold that. Well, come on! and you've beaten Bulldog! Anders Bo! Anders Bo, wake up. Look at me. Anders Bo? Hi. Anders Bo... No! - Stop, Bulldog. Stop! - Stop? - Bulldog, what are you doing? No! - No? There, now. Easy. Easy... Easy, now. There... CLIENTS These will make you feel better. Here's some of Holger's old clothes. Join us when you're ready, okay? Thanks. - Holger, do you sleep here, too? - Yes. - Don't you two ever take time off? - Sure! All weekends and holidays, except Sundays. - That's for relaxing with paperwork. - Did Amalie ever ask for time off? Hm... Yes! Twice a year for her dental appointments. So, don't say she doesn't have fun. The socks on the lamp are clean, by the way. Patrick? If it isn't Anders Bo! Risen from the dead! For he's a jolly good fellow yes he's a jolly good fellow for he's a jolly good fellow the foreman of the shop No, he's not, Holger! Like hell he is. No, Wussy. Hey, Torben! There's still schnapps left! - He looks great in my old clothes. - Just like you, when you were young. That's what I'm saying. Amalie, why don't you take a vacation? Pamper yourself a little. - I'm sure I can run this thing alone. - Without me? What brought this on all of a sudden? It's not sudden at all. A father always ponders what's best for his girl. The dance floor is open. Let's all hit it hard. Polina? - Quite a lively wife you've got there. - Yes... yeah. She does what feels right... to her. We met on the internet and... ... and when I'd paid, she came to Denmark. She has great mileage, Nico! It's wonderful that others find pleasure in her company... and not just me. - Am I interrupting something? - Not at all. - Would you like to dance? - Sure. Hang on. I can't dance in these. Gunnar! I wanna show you something! I'm glad you like our new foreman. But look out for yourself, okay? He seems very nice. But I don't really know him. No, I didn't know Polina, either. If I hadn't snatched her up right there, someone else would have. How does that make you feel? I can see why Torben gets mad at you. You only focus on the feelings of others and not your own. How does that make you feel? - This had better be important! - What are you doing? - Your mom rocks at bowling. - Bowling? - I got her a Wii. She's kicking my ass! - She doesn't like stuff like that. That's not what I'm seeing! She loves it! And the massage chair and spa fit perfectly! - You gave her a spa? - With plenty of room for two! Why does Holger keep a photo of you in his office? I told you! He's weird! Get the client list, and get the hell out! Yes. Hey, sailor. You and I have a dirty date on the dance floor. If you've got the guts. I'm not sure... - I see you changed shoes. - Yes. Let's dance, before you hurt yourself even worse. Let's go. Hey! This one is for you, Polina! Go, go Polina! Polish it, Polina! It's getting hot in here. Did we miss something? Shall we? - Bulldog... - Hang on, hey... - Bulldog, we'll dance later, okay? - Amalie? Amalie, I'll be right back. Why the hell does everyone leave their drinks up here? - Nico, can I trust you? - Sure. - Hey! Can I trust you? - Does a monkey scratch its ass? Aw, Bulldog. Will I get a Mastodont car? Take care of Bulldog, and I'll pave the way for you, okay? - There you go, Bulldog! - Damn, what a hairy butt! It's cute! - Let's see yours, Stella. - No! No! - Stella what are those marks? - Bulldog did that. - Torben's going to vacuum! - No, no, Torben. Join in. - No, I'm way too busy. - Let's see your tiny ass. Look! Bulldog! - Seriously! - Apologize, Bulldog! And to Anders Bo, as well. - Friends? - Wait a... - Friends. - Stop, Bulldog. No, no! - Not friends? - Sure. - Huh? - Yes. Friends. - Will I get a car like this? - I wouldn't count on anything now! Patrick will figure something out. Look, a shiny new manual. - It was a stupid plan. - A great plan, if you ask me. If you'd been exposed to half the crap Holger put Patrick through - - you'd also do whatever it took to shut this place down. It's got Global Anti-theft Protection and GPS tracking. Crap? What' did Holger ever do to Patrick? Didn't you hear? Patrick was supposed to take over... Come have a look! - Wow, Patrick. What a car! - Yeah, don't you think? - It's beautiful. - Look! Automatic transmission! - Ain't that something. - Far out, huh? - Our company bought it. - My company? I learned it at trade school. We should sell new cars, just like this one. Look at these drawings of our facade expansion. It's a giant showroom. The 'show what you've got' strategy. - It's too expensive. - We'll finance it with a loan. And we'll import new cars. It'll be groovy! I'm proud of you, Patrick. You're full of good ideas - - that are very costly. But they sure are... uh... gravy. - What about the company name? - What about it? - How do you like this? - Absolutely not! Your mother came up with the brilliant 'Holger's Auto', and that stays! And that's... Marshmallows! Patrick, you got me marshmallows! Don't you get it? I went all the way to Hamburg and back to get the car! No harm done! Now we can have a cosy old time together! Open these. Oh my god, marshmallows are so tasty! - Take a chill pill, would you! - Cherry Coke! You will live to regret this, dad! I'll show you how to run a car dealership! He survived on marshmallows and cherry coke for 2 weeks in that trunk. - It explains Holger's claustrophobia. - Don't ever feed him marshmallows. The rest, as they say, is history. So, all this is because of a family feud. - Nico, I need to make a call. - Sure. I'll see you in there. - Yeah. May I take... - Go ahead. - Patrick's phone, Gerda here. - Mom? Hi, sweetie. Can this wait? I'm in the middle of a fight. Is it Anders Bo? Won't he join us? - Put Patrick on. - I thought he was with you. He should be there any minute now. He left 10 minutes ago. Mom? Where have you been? I've missed you terribly! - Have you seen Amalie? - Whoah! It's freezing! - How about some coffee? - There are other ways to get warm! On the third day of Christmas my true love gave to me... Stella? - We'rejust having fun. - You've had one drink too many. - Stay! - Stella, let go of him! - You just don't want to share him! - Let go before someone gets hurt! Okay! But you had your chance, mister! Wave goodbye to it, Gunnar Bo! - I'm so sorry. Are you okay? - Yeah, I'm okay. She's always like that at our Christmas parties. Anders Bo, I was wondering... Would you join me on a ski vacation to Italy? Uh, Amalie... There's something I need to tell you... Is that Torben? What's he doing? Torben? Get lost! Stay away from me! Stop! You're too drunk to drive! - Stop that! - Stop, Anders Bo! What's that smell? You could get killed! Everyone would miss you! - Nobody here cares about me. - Yes, they do! - Wussy always thinks about you. - I feel sick. Holger knows you need 5 spoonfuls instant coffee on Fridays. He attends all your team's matches, even though he hates soccer. And he's so proud of you, Torben. He is? - I'm very fond of him, too. - Exactly! So, let's go back home. Yeah. Yes. How great is this? I want to go home to Holger. Holger... No, watch out! - Are you okay? - What happened? Huh? Whoah. We're home! That car sure has taken a beating. Let'sjoin the others. Come on, let's go! Holger! Are you okay? Yes. What you said to Torben was beautiful. But I feel bad, 'cause... Let's gojoin the others. Come. Patrick Ejlerskov! Anders Bo told me everything. - I'm all pumped up on dedication. - Fine, where's Anders Bo? No idea. But you can count on me and my dedication. I don't need him. I just need to open that safe. Leave that to me, Patrick. Nico Holm is on the job. Good. Well, unless it's wired like a casino vault. - You know... 'Ocean's Eleven'? - What? Let's beat the house, Patrick! Get on with it! Wussy! Wussy! I love your scent of exhaust. - Holger! - Yes? Holger, uhm... I want you to know that I can go to soccer matches all by myself. If you'll just let me stay here for another 20 years, I'll be a happy man. - Of course, Torben. - Thank you. You and Gunnar will make an amazing team. Yes, Holger! And if you hire Polina, we'll have a show like that every day. Yes... Allan. I'm sick of your comments about Polina. You're very rude towards her. And you're actually very rude towards me, too, Allan. Yes... I apologize. Yes, Allan. Yeah, yeah. - Is Nico still around? - Nico? Here you go, Bulldog. Bulldog? Friends. Yes! Friends. Drink up. Well done! We'll have that key delivered on a silver platter in no time. Except your silver platter is a plastic bag full of vomit. Feeling queasy, Bulldog? Do you have something for us? Yes, come on. Grab the bucket! Piece of cake, Patrick. Holger's hearing aid? Bulldog! Here they are! The Mazda keys. We'll never find that key! What if he's been to the bathroom? - We can handle that, too! - No! That's taking dedication too far. I know that safe. We can pull open the door. - With our bare hands? - No. With that thing. We're on a roll, Patrick! What are you doing? There's no need to... Stay back! This client register is ours! Right, Patrick? - Or should I say 'boss'? - I was supposed to be in charge here! Stop, Patrick! It won't work! Stop! Anders Bo! And Patrick? - I'm not with them! - You broke into the safe? What the...? - Are you with Mastodont? - No, no! - You should've told us! - It's your own fault. I didn't mean to. He wanted me to steal your clients... I've had it with this place! I'll wipe it off the face of the earth! Patrick, let's talk about this. Come on, Patrick... I'm sick of it, too. This is the worst place I've worked in the last 2 years. You've never worked anywhere more than 2 months! Aah! It's still a crappy place! I'm sorry to have to disappoint you, but... ... I quit! That stings, huh? Chew on that! No more Nico Holm. Patrick! - I can explain everything. - You've played us all! I was so fond of you! - And I wasn't the only one! - Stella... Amalie, everything between us was real! - But you don't care about the others. - Please stop! I think I'm in love with you. - You're just saying that to get away. - No, I'm saying it so I can stay! And Amalie... I'd love to go on that ski vacation! If I mean anything to you, you'll stop that and let me go! Give me that! For crying out loud, Torben! Why did you shoot a nail into my leg? - My aim was off! - Stop! Let him go. And now we'll dance around the Christmas tree, just like every year. - We just have to light it first. - Dad, seriously? As soon as this is lit, the good old atmosphere will come back. Thank you for a wonderful party. A car accident, a beating and a nail in your thigh. That's a wonderful party to you? Hello? Help! - Doesn't that sound like Frans? - It can't be. He went home. Hello! Help! - It's coming from the chimney. - Come on! - Hello! - He can't be in there. - It sounds like... - Help! Frans is that you? Frans is in the chimney! What on earth? We must get him out. Hello! Young man. Elsa and I have decided that I won't stand for this any longer! - We want our car back. Now! - I don't work here anymore. You're the guy from the interview! You got the job, then? - Yes. - Congratulations! - Have you been fired already? - Yes. That must've been quite a party. - I don't know if your car is ready. - Then they should step on it! Or I'll take it to Mastodont... says Elsa. If you want to deal with honest people, this is the place. I know, but if I don't get my car now, there'll be no action in the moth hole. Hey! Hey! Friends. Thank you, Bulldog. I'm sorry if I've messed things up between you and Amalie. Stella. No! Fine. - Come on, Wussy! - I'm pulling all I can! Frans? Are you wearing a costume? Woohoo! It's Patrick! Tractor! Patrick? I'll damn well grind this bloody place to dust! Anders Bo? Get off my bulldozer! - Johannes, the ladder. - My car! Elsa! No! No! - Watch out! - Bulldog. - No! - Bulldog? You ran over Bulldog! What do you want? I want Holger to apologize! For everything! And for all the years I've missed him. Patrick, there's nothing Holger loves more than his daughter... ... and his son! Really? Then let's stop this piece of crap! Immediately! Pull! - It's coming this way. - Pull! Oh, no! The brakes. Do something, Anders Bo! Frans? Frans! We have no brakes! - You don't seem to know Frans! - What's he doing? This is the end for Dad's auto. If you want to wreck Holger's Auto, you have to get past me first! What's that? It worked! - We're not moving! - My pen! Did you see me? It was me! Frans! Bulldog! Frans, get the ladder! The ladder? I'm on it! Bulldog! - Bulldog? - Bulldog? Bulldog? Do you think he's hurt? What's going on? Bulldog! Did I miss anything? You're back to your old self, Bulldog! Bulldog! You! - Easy, Bulldog. - And you are? - He's with me. - Aha. Did I miss the party? No, no! We're not done on the roof yet. Patrick, come here. I'm so happy to see you, son. I'm very impressed with what you've accomplished on your own. I've missed you too, Dad. - Shall we go dance around the tree? - Absolutely! This is wonderful. - Look, I fixed the tree! - Beautiful, Torben. - How about that ski trip to Italy? - Only if it's with you. Well, you could ask Stella. - You don't remember anything, at all? - Nah, I don't think so. - Why? - It's nothing... No, no! It's nothing. I'm so happy that you're happy, Torben. How does that make you feel, Wussy? Patrick, would you give us a hand while they're away on vacation? - I'd love to. - Great! Come one everyone! It's dancing time! - The usual one! Ready! - 1, 2, 3! Silent night Holy night all is calm all is bright round yon Virgin mother and child Holy Infant, so tender and mild Sleep in heavenly peace Gentlemen! Nico Holm, CEO, Managing director and chief. Which one of you sissies really wants this? Thank you for coming. - How does that make you feel? - Goddammit, stop that! - How does that make you feel? - Goddammit, stop that! - How does that make you feel? - I'm sorry... How does that make you feel, Torben? And...? - Do you need a break? - No, I'm fine. From the top. Come on! Take it away! How does... That's great. It's great. Say it like you did before. How does that make you feel, Torben? Try to keep a straight face at the same time, guys. - Okay, here goes nothing. - Yes. If you had... uhm... half the crap... - Is anything happening? - Are we doing this or what? Ah! Cinnamon! - Terrific! Gunnar picked Anders Bo! - Bulldog picked Anders Bo. Terrific! Bulldog picked... Terrific! Bulldog pill... Yes. That is correct. - Torben! Let us know you're here! - My name is Frans. Get lost, loser, dickhead, nut... What was it? Jinglebells. Get lost, dickhead... Why do I keep forgetting that? Easy now, junior. This... is where I forget my line. Easy now, junior. All I want is determination, dedication and... ... vitamin D. That's what I want. The others don't know you get a company car, shareholders... ... wankers and... That's what they get! One moment. Yes, here we go. Thank god, you're not all waiting for me.
