Check out last season. The Nightmares of Monster High and the Gargoyles of Granite City are dead even. Granite City! Monster High is number one! We'll win the race and have some fun! Scream so loud the dead can hear it! Show your school you've got some spirit! Go Clawd! Go! Yeah! Check it out, ghouls, we're on TV! No way! I'm the captain, look at me! Do not see the big deal about skate game. I have been skating since I was knee high to yak. Roller skate game? No, it's so much more than that, love. Skultimate Roller Maze, or Scream, as we call it, is a race through an ever-changin' labyrinth. Each team has to make their way through a course chock-full of traps and dangerous obstacles as they try to get one of their teammates across the finish line. Winning is all about how ya adapt to what the course throws at ya. How well ya work as a team. And the ability to think on your feet while moving at breakneck speeds! The Gargoyles are our biggest and oldest rivals. Every time we play, each school competes for the other school's crest. It's a tradition that's been goin' on for hundreds of years. No one wants to lose their crest, so the race can get pretty aggro. Get him! Wow! Gil! We're in for Gil and Deuce! Come on, let's smoke these suckers! Go get 'em, guys! Gary. It's time we finish 'em off for good. Monster High plays like a bunch of girls anyway! Whoa! They're headin' down the Final Run! Here they come! It's too close to call! Clawd! Clawd! Rocco! Rocco! Whoo! Number one! And the winner is Granite City! No! No! And as the victor, the Granite City Gargoyles are awarded the Monster High Crest! You have to get motivated to save the planet or else it will fall apart! See? Want a leaflet? They're biodegradable! Sure, Venus. I just wanna read about something other than that game on Friday. Talk about a major bummer. Yeah, it's all over Spectra's blog. Monster High smashed against rocks. Major fail. Worst loss ever! Whoa. Have not seen school so upset before. Is because of losing games? Scream is a bigger deal than you guys know. Go Gargoyles! You got some nerve. What kind of monster turns their back on their school? A winning monster. Or haven't you read? Watch your sandpaper tongue. Is not nice to rub it in. Oh, you're right. It's not nice. Mmm... But it sure is fun! There is something going on here. We better go see Bloodgood and get the gore-1-1. Oh, no, Frankie, it's more than just a game. When Granite City won, they took the Monster High Crest, and with it, our school spirit. You mean, like, a symbol and stuff? No, Frankie, an actual spirit. It is the physical embodiment of our school pride. I don't know if Monster High will survive for long without it. Then we gotta get it back! It's not that easy. The only way to get our crest back now is to make it to the championship game and beat the Gargoyles. Ghouls, I'm afraid it's over. Attention, students. I regret to inform you that the school's production of Bats has been canceled due to a sudden collapse of the stage. Oh, and it's double homework week. You've got to be kidding me! There. Wrapped like my mummy. Thanks, Cleo. But yo, I'm still saying those dudes cheated. Like, what are the odds of Clawd's skates breaking just before the finish line? That's a great idea, Ghoulia! You should search the track for evidence, maybe we can get them disqualified. I'm so sorry, lads. You'll get 'em next time. There won't be a next time. Unless Clawd's okay, the whole season's washed down the drain. Hey, guys. Oh, no! The vet says I'll be in a cast for six weeks. Oh, there you are! I was so worried! I was afraid they were going to send you to that farm they sent your grandmother to! I just can't believe we lost. I let everybody down. Don't be so hard on yourself. It's just one game, right? I mean, seriously, what's wrong with everybody? It's like a morgue in here. And not in a good way. They took our crest, Frankie! Our school spirit! So, we'll get it back when we play them again. No biggie. How? We only have two healthy players. Ah, forget it. There will be no more Skultimate Roller Maze this year. I'm officially canceling the season! Whoa. Monster High looks worse than mountain goat in high heels. Yeah, I thought everyone would be back to normal today. Ah! Oh, man. Oh! Clawd, you poor thing. Let me help you. It's okay, I got it. I'm sorry. I just... If I'm gonna be like this for six weeks, I better learn to do it on my own. This is bad, you guys. I wish there was something we could do. That team meant the world to him. To everybody, it seems. Why can't the team keep playing? There's plenty of able-bodied monsters in this school. We can hold tryouts! I don't know if Clawd would like us messing around with his team. You saw how grumpy he was. Yeah, but that's just 'cause he's sad and hurt. Come on, you said yourself that team means the world to him. Don't you want to cheer him up? Well, of course, more than anything. Then it's settled. We're doin' this! Ah! So, which one of these guys has what it takes? Well, that one is a great athlete. And that vampire is so agile and graceful. But there's more to this game than just athleticism and agility. Really? Like what? Well, there's game tactics. Strategy. Skates. Um, sorry. Lagoona, you and Clawdeen better go help out those clumsy creatures. Skatin' isn't about strength, mates. It's about balance and coordination. It's like glidin' in the water. Hey, you guys, hear that? It's the sound of a girl trying to teach us about Scream. She's just trying to help you! Maybe if you shut your snouts and pay attention, you might learn a thing or two. Puh-lease. What are we going to learn from her? How to accessorize our uniforms? Oh, man. Lagoona. Show them how it's done. What! Awesome. What? Are you thinking what I'm thinking? Depends. Were you thinking that Lagoona should be on Scream team? Or do you wonder why snowmen always smiling? Uh... Seems like very boring job. The first one. Lagoona, you should be on the team! What? Me? What? What are they talking about? Seriously? Come on, it makes sense. You love this sport more than anyone I know. Plus, let's face it, you're the best one here. Wait, hold on, aren't there rules against girls playing? Mmm. I don't think there is. Oh, yeah. Robecca Steam! Who-becca-what Steam? Robecca Steam was the first Scream superstar, all those years ago. Wow, I'd forgotten all about her. Count me in, I'll play! Whoa, whoa, whoa. We're not playing on any team with a girl on it. Why not? Because it's a boy's sport. It's sacred. It's tradition. Then it's a stupid tradition. If she's on the team, we're not. She's on the team. Then see ya, wouldn't want to be ya. Come on, fellas. Good luck making a team with no boys! Whoa! Oh, no, now there's no team at all! Not true, you do have team. Lagoona, she make one. And I make two. And I make three! Four! Five! I suppose it looks pretty bad if I don't put my hand in at this point. Very well. Six. For Monster High! Whoo! Ta-da! Check it out, Clawd, your new Scream team, ready for you to coach to the championship! No need to thank me. What is this, some kind ofjoke? No, this is the team. Your team. Now, I know we don't have a lot of experience, but I think with the right coaching, and a lot of... It's a bunch of girls! So? The boys wouldn't play, but we will! Girls don't play Scream! But there's no rule against it. In fact, the first Scream superstar was a girl, Robecca Steam. That's right! And you know what happened to her? She got demolished! Nobody ever saw her again. It's too dangerous for girls. But... No. If you're going to go through with this... You're gonna do it on your own. Clawd, wait. What did Clawd say? Oh, he doesn't want to talk about it. I'm sorry, love. It was worth a go. Well. Who wants to go to the mall? Wait, hey, you can't go! Frankie, face it. This thing is over like last week's shoe sale. But, we're a team. No. We're just a bunch of girls in tacky, oversized uniforms. Come on, our school needs us. But the next game is in less than a week and we've never even played! Then we'll have to learn fast. For Monster High? For Monster High! Whoa! This is easy. Whoa! Oh! Watch out! Sorry. Huh? Oh, no! Watch out! We can't stop! Can't stop! Oh, no! We're going over! Operetta! You really saved our bolts. You're fang-tastic! Oh, well, that was nothing. I've been swingin' on chandeliers since before I learned to walk. Hey, we could totally use you for the new Scream team! Our first game is tomorrow! Wanna join? Sweetie, I don't join anything. Specially something as conformist and traditional as organized team sports. Ugh! Not really a "Ra-ra, do it for your school" type of ghoul. You know what I'm sayin'? Take care now. Slaydies and gentlemonsters, the race is about to begin! Please give a cold welcome to the zombies of Graveyard Prep! And now, put your hands together for... Girls? I... I mean, Monster High! Hi. Yay. Yeah. This is gonna be smokin'! Okay, Frankie, did Ghoulia catch ya up on all the rules and strategy? Yeah, uh, I think. Just stick close to us and you'll be fine, mate. Good thing we're playing the zombies. They're the slowest team in the league. That's why this is the perfect match for us to get our feet wet and learn. I'm just so nervous. I don't want to blow it for the school. Hey, come on, we got this. A false start! Monster High is disqualified! Oh, man, I can't wait to put this online! Hey, do you want the planet to decay like this school? Cans go in the recycling! Cans go in the recycling. Hey, great game, girl. I must've watched it on Fright Tube a hundred times. Huh, I can't tell if it's funny, sad, or both. Whoa! I don't get it. Why does it feel like the whole school's against us? Nobody likes it when you mess with tradition. Face it, we stink like chin hair of unwashed goat. If we lose two more times, we'll miss the playoffs and our season will officially be over. And it's not gettin' any easier. Our next game is against the Vampire Academy. They're really good. Not to be Gloomy Gustav, but we going to get crushed. Avalanche-style. We have to try. Hey. Hey, Clawd. Also customary greeting! Can I talk to you for a sec? Totes! You want to give me some tips for our next game? No, I want you to quit doing this. Quit? I thought you'd be proud of me. I'm playing Scream just like you! Yeah, and look what happened to me! But I don't get it. Ever since I've known you, you've told me to take risks, to challenge myself, that I could do anything. I guess you don't believe in me after all. That's not it, I'm worried about you. Well, maybe if we had someone to coach us, someone who knew what they were doing. Uh-uh, no way. Forget it. I'm not helping you injure yourself. Matter of fact, as your boyfriend, I... I won't let you play! Mmm-hmm. Well, I guess that settles it then. Phew! Finally! I'm sorry, but this is for your own... I'm playing! Because it's important. Okay, so I'm not very good. I'm not tall or fast or strong. But my friends need me, and I'm not going to just quit and let them down. I'm not that kind of monster. Better save your tears for the track. You're gonna need 'em after you lose the next game! Can you girls re-enact your epic fail from Friday? My Fright Tube subscribers are beggin' for more crashin' and burnin'! I'm so sorry about that, sugars. I was just workin' on my moves, I didn't see you there. Now, you better run along now and clean yourselves up. Hey, I didn't realize y'all were such rebels. Anyone who bucks the system is aces in my book. I'm in. And I'm out. Voltageous! For Monster High? Fine. For Monster High. Okay, ghouls, I know we lost the first game, but we can still make the playoffs, and now that we've got Operetta, I'd say things are looking up. Listen, ladies, that was a tough loss the other night. I'd just like to tell ya, good game. I'd like to, but I can't, you were awful! You lost to the worst team in the league! Ghouls playing Scream. Ha! Come on, fellas. Attention, students. Time for morning announcements. Oh, who am I kidding? We're all doomed. Slow down. Slow down? Honey, I think I'm having trouble with your accent, 'cause I don't speak "slow down. " Yee-haw! And that, my friends, is a new record! Whoo-hoo! What's the big idea? You ran over your own teammate to win? Who cares how you win, as long as you win. That's not the point, mate. And there is no "I" in "team. " Well, there sure enough is one in "win. " But y'all wouldn't know about that, would ya? I've never met such a selfish monster! Hold on, I know everybody's bolts are a little tight from all the pressure, but taking it out on each other is not the answer. Well, what is the answer? Obviously we're getting nowhere! Totally unfair. Here, we already like each other. So let's just work it out. This is what it sounds like when yaks cry. Okay, okay, that's it. Everybody line up, single file. Now! Move, move, move! Clawdeen, Lagoona. Good job on that finish, but they would've had you on that last turn. Keep it tight! Operetta, you're fast, you got great moves, but remember you have other teammates, too. Frankie, stay tight in your stance. I knew he'd come around. Me, too! Are you two giggling? Yes, sorry, sweetie. I mean, Clawd. I mean, Coach! There's no giggling in Scream! Now, everybody get in their starting positions, we're gonna go over this again. If you're going to beat the boys, you've got to play like the boys! You gotta beat them at their own game. Fight fire with more fire. You gotta be stronger, faster. Ooh! They push you, you push them back harder. They push you again, you put them on their butts. Oh, no, unbelievable! Monster High has just taken the lead from the Vampire Academy! Don't take that! Get in there! And now, it's a race to the finish. Two players, monster-to-monster! Oh! Huzzah! Huzzah! I don't get it. How could we lose? No, it's not your fault. You came up with a great game plan. This one's on me. I don't wanna make anyone pop a stitch, but if we lose one more game, we won't make the playoffs. Clawd, it's okay, you tried your best, and... Whoa! What's that? What? And you found all these parts on the track? Who is this? Robecca Steam! Uh, can I try? I have some family experience with this whole reanimation dealio. Hi! I'm Frankie. I'm Robecca. Robecca Steam. What happened? The Robecca Steam? Wow. The first girl to ever play Scream, right here in front of us! Happy to be here. The last thing I remember, I was racing against the Gargoyles. Two of them came right at me, and then... Lights out! Wow, all of you girls play, too? How exciting. Times sure have changed since my day. Not really. We're the only all-girl team in the league. And we have to win all of our remaining games. If we don't, our school will fall apart. It's all my fault! I'm holding everyone back. No. It's not you. It's me. I didn't train you girls hard enough. Starting today, you're gonna be in the gym and on your skates for six hours every practice, seven practices a day, nine days a week. It's not even mathematically possible! I call it Beast Mode. Will that work? No. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Why not? It worked for the boys' team. I tried to beat the boys by playing like them. I wasn't true to myself, and look what happened to me. So, if you wanna beat the boys, you gotta play like girls. That'd be great! Oh, yeah! Oh, my gosh. Robecca, you wanna join us? I don't know. I'm a little rusty. Come on! You're Robecca Steam! I guess I could try. Ah. Whoa! I'm still missing my balance module. I guess I can't help you girls after all. Actually, you already have. Wow, you ghouls look spook-tacular! Total front page material! I thought you quit the team? Does this mean you'll play? Oh, my Ra, no! I just look good in the uniform. Remember, the road to saving our school starts right here. Hey, nice uniforms, losers! What're you boulder-brains doin' here? We just came to watch you lose. Yeah, we wanted to witness the end of Monster High up close. Right, Rock? That is enough! A girl? Yes. Yes, I am. I am Rochelle. We were playing with a girl? You did. Huh. Not anymore. I quit your team! You have inspired me to be myself. I have already put in for the transfer. And I would love to play with you, if you will have me. Of course! We are so excited. You're like one of their best players. Well, this is highly unusual, but everything seems to be in order. Rochelle, welcome to Monster High! You play like a bunch of girls. Not yet. But we're about to. Yeah. An amazing upset! The new Monster High team scores its first victory! Ha! Oh, yeah! Sweet revenge! Monster High is on a roll! Monster High! Monster High! The impossible! The incredible! The inconceivable has just happened! In one of the greatest comebacks ever, Monster High has made the finals! Where they'll face their biggest rival, Granite City! TORALEl: The finals? Those clumsy kitties made the finals? They're actually pretty good. And Robecca Steam is helping 'em out now! Relax. We ain't losing to no girls. We gonna take 'em out again, Rock? Mess with their skates, like we did to the wolf? Hey, hey, hey! We don't talk about that in front of... Oh, please. You think I don't know that you cheated? It's your style. It's my style. So, I don't care how you do it. Just beat them! Well, then maybe you can help. You girls wanna get one more lap in? You're on! Let's race! But that's not the point. Said the ghoul who finished second. See ya! Oh, my Ra! They are looking epically fast today. I can't wait to beat those Gargoyles. I don't think it's enough. Are you joking? Thanks to my royal presence and Robecca's advice, they've finally harnessed their inner sports diva. But this is Granite City. They're bigger, faster. Plus, those Gargoyles play dirty. Don't they? Is true. They always make sure they win at any cost. Every team has a weakness, Clawd. You just have to look for it. Robecca, you're a genius! Whoo-hoo! I win! Oh, I'm sorry! Again! We were supposed to be working together, mate. We're on the same team. Well, maybe you should... Hey! That's it! Operetta, I need you over here right now! What'd I do? What? What'd I do? Look, if you're gonna be a part of this team, you need to start acting like it! We need to talk about your attitude problem! Fine! But I don't have an attitude problem, fur ball! Mmm. There are the girls! The school! They are cheering for us! Oh! Thank you, thank you! Oh, you should have! You should have! Look, about what we said earlier... We're sorry! We were wrong about you. You girls sizzle! Give those Gargoyles heck! Mmm. What's the matter? Shouldn't you be with your team? I shouldn't be talking to you. I hear you're the only reason they're even in the finals. Bet they don't even appreciate how great you are, do they? They don't get it. I'm the best dang player on that team! They wouldn't be anywhere without me. But all I get is guff. I wish I could say I'm shocked. But that's just how those girls are. You know, if you wanna get back... Oh, no, it's too much. No, no, no. What? Well, my boyfriend is the captain of Granite City. Got any inside info for me? Well. Oh, all right. I heard Clawd and Robecca talking about this "special play. " They said it would guarantee us the win. Mmm-hmm. Go on. I'm all ears. Ghouls, I want you to know everyone is behind you! We know you can win! We are all counting on you. Win that championship and bring back our crest! The hopes of an entire school are riding on you. You know, it was almost easier when they was all rootin' against us. Yeah, I know what you mean. Now everybody's counting on us. All this pressure. It's like deep sea diving. That's not pressure you feel. That's the energy of every student at Monster High, believing in you. Come on. Let's go get you ready. I want you to know something. No matter what happens out there today, I have never been prouder of a group of monsters in my life. And because of you, because you kept on fighting when everyone told you to give up. Every little girl who watches tonight and says, "I want to do that. " Nobody can tell them, "You can't because you're a girl. " What? It's just allergies. Now, there's some monsters in the other locker room who wanna make you pay for coming into "the boys' turf. " Are you gonna let them? No. No. They wanna embarrass you in your own house. Are we going to let them? No! They wanna take that championship trophy home and put it right next to the Monster High Crest. No! Now, go out there and play like girls! Yeah! Black, white, pink, blue! If guys can do it, girls can, too! Ladies and gentlemen, we are live at the Skultimate Roller Maze Championships! A grudge match between the Granite City Gargoyles and the Monster High Nightmares! Abbey, Clawdeen, Draculaura, you guys start us off. Listen... Coach. I don't think you should play me tonight. I'm no good. Draculaura. Come on, that's not true. You can't risk putting me out there. It's too important. Lagoona, you're in! Yeah! Against all odds, Monster High is keeping pace with the much larger, much stronger Granite City squad. It's anybody's race! Ah, too slow! Nope. Nice try, dude. That one wasn't your best effort. Whoa! Oh! Clawdeen! Timeout! Oh, it's an injury timeout. You okay? You need to come out? Are you kidding? My leg! I can't go back out there. You sure? All right, Draculaura, you're in for Clawdeen! Clawd, that's crazy. The race is almost over, we can still win! I know. Whoa! And we're coming to the home stretch, it's neck-and-neck. Got this in the bag! Now! It's all you, sugar! Oh, my! It's as if she was born to fly! No! Oh, yeah! That's it! Yeah! No! Told ya! My plan worked perfectly! That conniving kitty Toralei could not resist the chance to betray us. And the Gargoyles couldn't resist an opportunity to cheat. That's their weakness! I don't know how you did it. But you beat us. Here's your stupid crest back. And we know the rules. Now you get our school crest. That's right! Yeah, take their crest! No. This is crazy. If we take your crest, your school is just going to fall apart and everyone's gonna be miserable. Why does it have to be that way? It's tradition. There's that word again. Just because something is tradition doesn't mean it's good. Tradition said that girls couldn't play Scream. And that Werewolves and Vampires couldn't go to the same school. Those are the kind of traditions that keep monsters apart. Sports should be about bringing them together. Keep your crest. You know, you guys are all right. For a bunch of ghouls. Oh. My balance module. Yeah, that's how you do it. Whoa! Hmm. Clawdeen, your leg seems fine now. Um, you know what a fast healer I am. Mmm-hmm. Thanks. And that's how a group of ghouls went toe-to-toe with tradition and made Scream a sport for everyone. Welcome, everyone, to a new season of Skultimate Roller Maze! And now, introducing your Monster High Scream Team! Player/coach, Clawd Wolf! Operetta! Manny Taur! Gil Webber! Lagoona Blue! Heath Burns! Rochelle Goyle! And, in her first game in more than a century, the legendary Robecca Steam! Hey, Robecca, you okay? Never been better. Let's win this thing!
