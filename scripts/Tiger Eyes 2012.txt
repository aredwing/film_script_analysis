The thing about it is... it's all so final. Davey, come on, we gotta go. I can't find my flats. Come on, we're gonna be late. - I can't find the right shoes. - Borrow a pair of mine. This kind, generous man. This loving husband and father... who left us much too soon... ...would want us to remember him from every portrait he created... ...every face that he found fascinating. Put some dirt on Daddy. And we're going to talk soon, okay? Salad? It's very good. Homemade. Your aunt says it's important to eat. And what does she know? She hasn't seen me since I was five. It's a nice picture of him, don't you think? Yeah. I took it myself. In June. Right in front of the store. You think it's a good idea to keep reading about it? What else am I supposed to do? I wonder if the cemetery will get all muddy? Have to put some kind of tarp thing over the grave. Or maybe it will be better for the grass, so it could finally grow back. Why don't you just take a break? Come out to New Mexico. I just hate to leave you in this neighborhood, alone. Okay, thank you. We don't want you to worry about money. We're in a position to help. I- I promise I'll pay it back. So you just call if you need anything. Get away! Get out of here! What are you gonna do about it? Do you hear me?! Get away! It's okay, they're gone. Go to sleep. How long will you be in New Mexico? Maybe like a week or so. Don't let her out at night... Oh, and don't let her drink out of the toilet bowl. Don't worry, I'll take good care of her. I know. Bye, Minka. Look, a balloon! Honey, get your head back inside. This is a moving car. Of the world's largest hot-air balloon festival. Walter, watch the road. I'd like to go up on one of those balloons. It's beautiful to watch, honey, but only a fool would actually go up in one. Well, then I guess I'm a fool. If Davey's going, I'm going. Nobody's going. It's a moot point. Walter, watch the road. What's a moot? It means it doesn't matter, honey. Because it's not going to happen. I'd like to go up... Never come down. Wow, it's really pretty here. It's like we're in another world. Well you can see why Oppenheimer chose Los Alamos as the site for "Project Y." What's "Project Y"? It's a codename for building the atomic bomb. And Los Alamos is the secret place where the scientists worked when they were developing it. Bitsy works as a guide at the museum. She knows everything about this place. So, we're in a secret place, where nobody can find us? Well, it's not that much of a secret anymore. Wow, look at this house! When we brought this house, we expected to raise a family here. - Didn't we, Walter? - We did. But... C'est la vie. We're just so happy you're here. We want you to have a wonderful time. It's not like we're on vacation, Aunt Bitsy. I know that, Davey. Jason... You take care of a car, it'll last for a long time. Like this little beauty. 253,000 miles and still going strong. Oh! Make sure you wear that helmet. And use plenty of sunscreen. You're at 7,500 feet here. Okay, Aunt Bitsy. Be careful! Ow! Daddy? Daddy? Can you hear me? Can you? Hey! You okay? Who, me? Yeah, you. I thought you were in trouble, the way you were calling out. I'm fine. What are you doing down here? Just thinking. - Is there a law against that? - No, no law against thinking. Except, you're alone. So, I'm alone. You're alone too. Yeah but, I mean, I've had plenty of experience. And who says I haven't? You don't know your ass from your armpit. You mean elbow, don't you? - Are you always so friendly? - When I feel like it. Ow. You're thirsty... You came into the canyon with no water? - I forgot it. - Here. Hey, easy, easy. You'll get sick. So, what's your name? Uh, you can call me... Wolf. Is that a first name or a last name? Either. Let's get going. I gotta be somewhere in an hour. So, go. You're going with me. Guess again. To be called up by Search and Rescue later, ok? I got other things to do. Do you live around here? Do you live around here, Wolf? The harder time you're going to have climbing. And next time, bring some water and a friend with you. - It's safer that way. - I don't have any friends here. Well, maybe you should make some. So, uh... So, what's your name? You can call me... Tiger. Tiger... Is that a first or a last? Neither. And over here are duplicates of the first atomic bombs, "Fat Man" and "Little Boy". They were detonated over Japan, in August, 1945. Now, these are the only two atomic weapons ever used in warfare. They represent one of the greatest scientific achievements of all time. And both bombs were designed, fabricated, and assembled right here in Los Alamos. They killed a lot of people, right? Yes... And in the next room... How many people did they kill? It was something like 220,000. Okay, thank you. Sarah's dad got blown up in a war and now he has a metal brain. Uh, does anyone have any questions? Does Uncle Walter make bombs? Uncle Walter is involved in Research and Design for National Security. Really? I didn't know that. Your Uncle Walter is a group leader in W Division. W? But today's lab is equally involved in health, medicine, energy, and environmental research. - Mom? - Excuse me a minute. I'll take care of this. Mom? Mom! The baby looked very much like a mouse in every way. He was only about two inches high and he had a mouse's sharp nose... I can't believe you design weapons. Yeah, it's my job, Davey. It's your job? That's it? I do my best to help protect us. To keep us safe. We all want to be safe, don't we? Don't we? Safe? Is that a joke? Before he was many days old, he was not only looking like a mouse, but acting like one too. He was wearing a gray hat and carrying a small case... Just me! Your mom loved cocoa with marshmallows when she was a little girl. She was afraid of the dark. So I used to tell her bedtime stories. Sometimes, I would pretend like she was my baby instead of my sister. Uhm, you know that your mom is seriously stressed and Walter and I don't think she should leave until she's feeling better. We feel responsible for you. Now, Jason is eager to go to school, so tomorrow I'm taking him over to Aspen. It's a very good elementary school. All of our schools are very, very good. And then I'm going to take you over and register at the high school. School? No, I, uh, I'm not going to school here. Davey, please don't make this harder than it has to be. You've missed a lot of school already, and your mom needs time to heal. Well, how much time? Well, as long as it takes. How am I supposed to go to school here, if I don't know how long I have to stay? What does that have to do with it? Everything. It's what we're doing... Good night. Okay, guys. So today we're going to talk about how this novel changed our ideas on traditional storytelling... Now, what I want you to do is think about the actions of these characters and ask yourself why. Why they made the decisions they made. Come on in. How are you doing? What do we got? We've got Davis Wexler... - Everyone calls me Davey. - Davey. Sure. Welcome. So... Tony Morrison's Beloved. That's what we're reading. - Have you read it? - No. Alright, well we can get you a copy after class. From someone who actually knows what's going on in here. I always know what's going on. But I think in this case Davey should go with... Jane. Jane, raise you hand for me. - That would be Jane. - Okay. Alright, guys... Hi. That's why my parents named me Jane. What do you mean? You know, that whole Davis and Davey thing. I mean with a simple name like Jane, nobody's ever confused. I'm used to it. ...alright? We're going to go over this next week. So, where are you from anyway? Atlantic City. Oh, that's in California, right? New Jersey. Oh, New Jersey, uhm, I guess I was thinking of, uhm, Studio City. That's near L.A. Atlantic City... That's where the Miss America pageant started out, right? Right. You want some? My father only drinks the best vodka. No... I'm good. Ignore them... They're "stomps" just slightly above Neanderthal. So what division is your dad in? At the lab. My dad? Um... He's uh, away... In India right now. Oh, my dad went to India... Hey, Davey. Ready to go? Whenever you are. - Bye, Daddy. - Alright. See you later, Mr. W. Stay off the beach... - And be home by ten. - Don't worry, Daddy. I mean, how can I not worry? What happened? Are you okay? It's... it's probably the altitude. I mean, you're new here. Hey, where are you going? Don't you have class? Hey! Hey! You new around here? I bet you can't tell your ass from your armpit. - Hey. - Hey. It's the tiger. In the flesh. What were you doing up there? See those caves? Tiwa people lived in them 800 years ago... my ancestors. Your ancestors? Yeah... Now that part of my family lives in a pueblo thirty miles that way. All I know about my family is my great grandmother lived in Atlantic City, in a boarding house... Like... two thousand miles that way. I think you mean that way. Right. That way. - We have a lot in common. - I was thinking the same thing. Get yourself a decent pair of climbing shoes and I'll take you up there. Wait, to the caves? You have a bright smile, Tiger... But sad eyes. You want to talk about it? - No. - Okay. Maybe someday, but... just not right now. Yeah. Whenever. What's wrong with Mom? Oh, you know... She's just got headaches. Is she gonna die? No, Jase. She's not going to die. How do you know? Because I know. What if she does? Will we stay here with Uncle Walter and Aunt Bitsy? She's not going to die, Jason. What if she does? Then, yeah. I guess we'd stay here. See the Big Dipper? I think so... I want to. Everything's going to be alright. I promise... Okay? It has to be. This time you've bitten off more than you can chew. I can handle it. You better, before it starts to affect my work. I don't have time for this. Shhh! She's my sister, Walter. This is important to me. She needs more help than you can give her. Then I'll make sure she gets it. Yeah and your niece, oh man. She's no piece of cake, either. I know what I'm doing. Well, I hope so, Bits. I hope so. The Society For the Preservation Of Creative Anachronisms. Uhm-I don't know what that is. Oh, we celebrate medieval life... You know, jousting matches and festivals. Don't take this the wrong way or anything, but I'm not really that into jousting. You can-you can give it a try. - I'm really busy as it is. - How so? I have a lot of family responsibilities. Go on... And she's volunteering at the hospital with me. Yeah! I'm volunteering at the hospital. I see. I thought you were the unusual type. But I can see that I was wrong. I hate being around sick people. But, it's going to look so good on my college application. So it's worth it. And if I don't get into Harvard or Stanford, my father is just going to kill me. He's head of T Division. - T Division? - Theoretical. He's the one who thinks brilliant thoughts. You have a lot to learn about Los Alamos, missy. Guess so. Oh, "103." That's you. Good luck. I've been waiting for you. You've been waiting for me? Any pretty girl. I am just here to refill your water. Look at this. My son brought it to me from California. - Silly, isn't it? - Yeah. Willie Ortiz. Davey Wexler. It's my first day as a volunteer. You like it? - It's yours. - No... I couldn't. Besides, I don't think we're allowed to take things from patients. I'll tell you what. I'm not going to be here very long. And when I'm gone, I want you to have it. Don't be sad. I'll uh, I'll see you next week, okay? Next week. Go do something that will make you happy. Watch me first. Okay, now you try. Use your legs for strength. Next step. Excellent. You gotta believe you can do it. Don't be afraid. Okay, take the next step. I got you. I knew you could do it. See the black carving? That's from their fires. Over 800 years old. Wow. - A cave with a view. - Yeah. You can see why the Tiwa people lived up here. Pretty good vantage point, huh? I wouldn't mind living here. I'd bring my little brother. And my cat. My cat would love to chase those. When Winter comes, all the lizards will disappear. You won't see them again until Spring. Then they'll lay out on the rocks, soaking up all the sun. Like me. You disappear in Winter? I might. When I was young... I used to climb here all the time with my father. I hope it never changes. Everything changes. Hey, Mom. Mom. You have to stop taking these. Did you hear me?! You need to stop taking these! Yeah, I have to stop taking them. Can you please get up? We need you. I'm not the person I was before. Before Adam. Good... That's great. She'll never get out of bed if you keep bringing food to her. You know, you're turning her into a zombie. Who's a zombie? No one. Time to get this batch in the oven, hmm? Now, how long are we going to bake them? Eight minutes, because of the high altitude. And what are we going to set our temperature at? Ugh, excellent. I love making cookies. You know, someday we can open a cookie shack in Atlantic City. And we'll call it "Jason's Cookies." Will it be on the boardwalk? Yes, it will be on the boardwalk. And in all the best hotels. Or you can just open one right here in Los Alamos. There's no boardwalk in Los Alamos. You know you're sitting in the same tub Oppenheimer used when he live here? Oppenheimer? Wait... As in the guy who invented the bomb? Yeah. - He lived here? - In this very house. Uhm. Hello? Yeah. Oh, hi Ted. Tonight? Really? Oh, okay. That's perfect! Okay. Okay, sweet! Eight o clock. Alright, see ya then. Davey, this is so exciting! Who is he? Only the most popular guy in school. Okay, we have to think up someone for you. How about Ruben? Ruben's perfect. What if Ted thinks I'm pathetic? I don't know, I'm just... I'm not really that experienced, you know? Wait, do you have a boyfriend? I mean did you have a boyfriend before you moved out here? No. ...but it does warm you up. She can be an idiot. But I love her like a sister. She's wasted. Well, yeah. That too. Davey! And so am I. Whoa! Oh, man. Isn't Ted amazing? Hey, I'm freezing. Let's warm up in the car. You don't have a car. I do now. I wish we had the keys to the ignition. I could use some heat in here. Make your own, dude. - Hi. - Hey. How are you doing? Can we talk? How about a walk on the beach? Yeah. Let her out, let her out! That's... really gross. Well... I gotta go. Tell Jane I'll uh, see her around school. I just drank a little too much. I'm fine, that's all. I just needed a little, just to loosen up, you know? Those boys... I'm just so shy! Shhhh. I'm sorry. Wait, guys, guys! The famous physicist. Shhhh! We couldn't be more pleased that you and Jane Albertson are friends. You know, her mother is in my Thursday book group. And her father, Bud Albertson, is a world class physicist. Isn't that right Walter? You bet! I hear Jane's no slouch either. Oh yeah... She's a straight A student. Maybe some of that can rub off on you. Maybe... Mom! You're up. I gotta get myself together. Well let's start with breakfast! Tea and toast? Sure. Mom guess what? So now I can read Captain Underpants all by myself. I can't wait for you to read that for me. Honey, you don't want to be late. Don't want to miss the bus. There you go. Have a good day. - I, I'll see you later? - Okay. Come... come in. Meet my son. Martin. This is Davey. Hello. Hi. Martin was a national Merit Scholarship winner. And he's runner-up to the Westinghouse contest. Come on, Dad. He doesn't like to talk about himself. So I do it for him. - Right Martin? - Yeah. He's going to be a brilliant physicist. He won a full scholarship to Cal-Tech. He's the first in the family to go to college. Come on, Dad. Rest. She should be on the swim team. She's got good shoulders. Why didn't you say anything? Why didn't you tell me your father was sick? I guess I'm just a private person. I am too. You know when you told me that I had sad eyes? Yeah. It's because my father died. I'm sorry, Tiger. Was he sick for a long time... Like my dad? No. I, it happened suddenly. Whatever happened... It's tough either way. Yeah. Double fours... 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. Ventnor... We used to live there. We still live there. That would be Ned. Hey, Ned. Come on in, everyone's ready. Oh, okay. Ned, this is Bitsy's sister, Gwen Wexler. Gwen, this is my colleague, Ned Grodzinski. Ned plays a piano in our group. Nice to meet you. I've heard a lot about you. Oh, okay. Gwen, you're in for a treat. Ned plays like an angel. You guys, keep the doors locked. Oh, Gwen. No place safer than the hill. Don't worry. We won't be long, okay? Bye. Twelve. 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12. Boardwalk. I'll take it. Okay, so I'm building a hotel on Boardwalk and another one on Park Place. And two houses... Wait have you been stealing the bank, you little creep? Yeah, you! Come here! Get back here! - No. No! - Come over here! I'm going to get you! - Please, stop! - Never! Stop. Stop. Stop. Jason... do you miss Daddy? Come on, Jason. I know you do. Why won't you just say it? I mean, why won't you ever cry? Crying's for babies. Now let me up! Not until you say you miss Daddy. No! Jason, say that you miss Daddy! No, you say it! Jase. Don't you want to go finish the game? Finish it yourself! It's easy to get lost in Santa Fe, so make sure you're back at the car by four. We will. Look at those. What do you think? For my mom. She'd like those. Yeah, you should get those. Alright. We'll get these. Here you go. Thank you. I'd like to get this. I bet this is for someone special. Yeah... it is. I have the feeling he's a lucky guy. Not really. Oh, God, it smells like plastic. Come on, dance with me. Oh, here they are. Hey, guys! Look what I got. Great. Wow, look at that. Give me a kiss. Merry Christmas, young lady. We really love you. Thanks. Boy, you are cold. - Let's go inside, okay? - I know, I'm freezing. Okay. This is for you, Daddy. Happy Chanukah. I wish you were here. I miss you so much. I thought you might need a friend tonight, Tiger. I know I do. Hey, what are you doing? Exactly what I feel like doing. How's the swimming team doing this year? The swim team? You're a swimmer, aren't you? Only in the ocean. The ocean? You should be on the team. I can tell from your shoulders you're strong. That's what counts. - Are you a swimmer? - I never learned. You can't swim? In New Mexico, there's not a lot of water. - What is it? - Don't be afraid. For two years I've been fighting this. - I'm ready. - Don't say that. "Life is a good adventure." Now, it's time for my next adventure. Not until you learn how to swim. I like a girl with a sense of humor. Isn't that the guy from the hospital? - Hey. - Hey! What are you doing here? Hop in. - Where are we going? - It's a surprise. - Uh, Jane, this is Wolf. - Hey. Wolf? What kind of name is that? Either a first or last name. Your choice. So, you're just going to leave me here? Martin Ortiz? It's good to see you. How's your papa? I heard he was sick. It's pretty rough. I'm sorry to hear that. He's a good man. Very devoted to you. He is... This is my friend, Tiger. - Nice to meet you, Tiger. - Nice to meet you guys, too. I'm glad you could make it to the ceremony. Come have some food. Say hello to everyone. Sure. My relatives. The making of a relation ceremony. Something we do from time to time. Martin Ortiz, my son. Come. This ceremony... ensures... that no one... is left to feel alone in the universe. It is vital, as we are social beings, who depend on one another. A person is taken in as a relative. Relatives are as strong as blood. It must be. Because the welfare... of the group... ...sometimes hinges on one individual. If that person... feels disconnected... He or she may fail. The medicine wheel... represents your connection... to the four directions... and the hoop of life. The feather represents your life. Because, like your hair... it grows. It represents your wisdom. It represents your connection... to the past. Thanks for bringing me tonight. Glad you were with me, Tiger. - I'm going to miss you. - What do you mean? I'm going away. Now? Soon. When will you be back? You're late. You missed dinner. Who was that in the truck? What truck? The truck you just got out of. He's a friend of mine. What friend? You don't know him. Well maybe I do. His name is Martin Ortiz. Ortiz? Does he to the high school? Not anymore. - He's a dropout? - I didn't say that. Okay, why don't you just tell me about him. Instead of playing twenty questions. I'm not the one playing twenty questions. You know, you can't just accept rides from boys, Davey. He's not just some boy. He goes to Cal-Tech. He's just taking some time off. Cal-Tech. It's an excellent school. That still doesn't mean you can get into a truck with a boy that we don't know. Mom. I'm sure that Bitsy knows what's best in this case, Davey. Since when? Since when does everyone here know better than you? You're turning into them. Do you realize that? Just afraid of everything. You know a person can get killed, minding his own store. Did you ever think about that? You apologize to your mother right now. Walter, she didn't mean it. Did you hear me? Did you hear me?! Your children are totally out of control, Gwen. Oh, really? Are they still my children? Stop it, stop it, Stop it, all of you! # Anytime you're feeling lonely # # Anytime you're feeling blue # Hey. You're late. I thought you weren't even coming. Well here I am, ready for the audition. Have you been drinking? No... Okay just a teensy, weeny bit. Just like a little. I'm fine, Davey. I'm fine. You can't tryout drunk. Well then I'm not going to try out, because I'm sure as hell not going up there sober. Then don't tryout. That was great, Joel. Thank you so much for coming. That was fabulous. Thanks again. Jane Albertson? Just tell her you changed your mind. Jane? Here. I'm here. Don't do this. Uhm... I want to do uh, "Anytime", right? Yes, right. You okay there? Yeah, I'm good, I'm good. Okay. Ready? # Anytime I'm feeling lonely # Anytime I'm feeling blue You could have had me... for a friend... and you chose her. I hope you're happy with your choice. Thank you so much, Jane, for coming. Thank you. Yeah. Are you okay? Yeah, I'm fine. I feel like I'm going to throw up. Davey Wexler? Go for it, Davey. I can't believe you signed me up. Davey Wexler. Here. - Hello. - Hi. Woo! Go for it, Davey. Shhh. Hush. Anytime you're ready. # Anytime you're feeling lonely # # Anytime you're feeling blue # # Anytime you feel downhearted # # That will prove your love for me is true # That was really good. I have the music right here. So why don't I give it to you... You rehearse it and Monday we'll work it through. Okay. Thank you. Okay, see you Monday. Jane. Jane, get up. Come on. Did I make a fool of myself? Yes, you did. Come on. Look, you need help. There's nothing wrong with me. Look, I'm trying to be your friend, so don't play this game with me. - And what game is that? - It's called denial. You're a great one to talk about denial. You... told me your father is in India. But that's not what your aunt told my mother. You really think you're the only one with all the problems? If you think my life is just so easy, you're wrong. Hey, it's a school night. You should be studying. I was watching that. You know... with a little effort you could be getting all A's and B's. You know, you're really not working up to your full potential. How do you know? You don't know anything about me. That you have to think about your future. It's never too early to have goals. I have goals. Well I hope they include improving your grades. It's what you learn that counts. Not what kind of grades you get. Where did you learn that? From my father. Yeah I should have guessed. You want to end up like him? No education. Running a sandwich shop? It's a wasted life. How dare you say that my father had a wasted life. You don't know anything. He was a better man than you. A better man than you could ever be. If your father had been a better man, your mother wouldn't be where she is now. That's so not true. That's another example of a wasted life. Pregnant in high school. Destitude at thirty-three. Shut up, asshole! I hate you. And... "When the lizards run". Does that mean something to you? Yeah... it does. Mr. Ortiz... Mr. Ortiz? Last night... His son was with him. He asked me to give you this. Hey, Davey. How are you doing? Ready to go? Whenever you are. See you later, Mr. W. Alright, stay off the beach. # Every time we say goodbye # # I wonder why a little Daddy. I need you. Thanks, Ruben. Break a leg, okay? And next up is Davey Wexler, singing "Anytime." Change of plans. # Every time we say goodbye I die a little # # Every time we say goodbye I wonder why a little # # Why the gods above me Who must be in the know # # Think so little of me They allow you to go # # When you're near # There's such an air of spring... about it # # I can hear a Lark somewhere # # begin to sing... about it # # There's no love song finer # But how strange the change From major to minor # # Every time we say... # What the hell? Daddy? Daddy! Daddy! Help me. Daddy! Daddy! Oh, my god. Daddy! Help me, Davey. I'm trying. Help! Somebody help! Help! Daddy! Daddy! Help! Help! There was a robbery. He was shot in the chest three times for 67 dollars. So that's how it was... I tried to help but... I couldn't. I just wish I knew what to do. Remember that you're alive. He'd want you to live. Your life... All the past... And all the future. In the summer, this was the home of the Tiwa people. Over 800 years ago. In the winter they would go down and live in the caves. Wow. You know a lot about this place, don't you? I had a good teacher. It's been a long time since we've done something, just the two of us. I know. You know, up until now I've uhm... I've been afraid to be alone with you. Afraid of me? I was afraid that you would want to talk about Daddy. And what happened that night. And I was afraid that it was going to be too painful for me. I did want to talk about it. I know. I'm so sorry. I'm ready to talk now, okay? I miss him. I miss him so much. I know, so do I. What are we going to do, Mom? I'm going to figure that out. It's a new recipe. But I substituted olive oil for canola, because canola just doesn't agree with Walter. I gotta remember that. Well, I have some news. We want you to know, we think Ned Grodzinski is a wonderful man, and we couldn't be happier for you. Wait, what? He's asked your mother to marry him. Ned is a good man, with a bright future. But I said no. You said no? Come on, Bits, it's way too soon. He's a good friend, but I'm not in love with him. Love? You're not a teenager this time, Gwen. Don't expect love to feel the way it did when you were seventeen. Well, what I was going to say is that it's time for us to make a move. What do y... What kind of move? It's time for us to go home. You can't! I mean the children are settled here. And you guys have been wonderful. I wouldn't have been able to manage without you, but it's time for us to go back home and start our new life as a family. We can help you find a place of your own right here, in Los Alamos. Try to understand. You should be the one to try to understand. I don't know what your mother is trying to prove. I don't know why she feels she has to do this. What does that mean? It means "Life is a good adventure." Sometimes it is, and sometimes it isn't. I admire your courage, Davey. I really do. Goodbye, Daddy. That I'm not going to think about you anymore. This doesn't mean t hat I'm not gonna... give up that night. Because that night happened and there's nothing I can do about it. I love you. I'll always love you. Goodbye. You okay? Yeah. This is for you. What is it? Open it. A tiger's eye. For my tiger. Thank you. Look.
