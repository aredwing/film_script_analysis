It wasn't something big and horrible that did us in. It wasn't nuclear war or a deadly virus or a comet crashing into the planet. It wasn't over-population or global warming. I wish it was. You know, something... lofty and magnificent, something worthy of exterminating most of the human race. No. In the end, it was none of those things. We simply ran out of gas. We haven't found a thing all day. - I'm getting tired. - Yeah, me, too. Okay, fine. I'll be dark soon anyways. We'll head back. Did you guys hear that? - Yeah, it sounded-- - Shut up. Ford! Your boyfriend's gonna get us all killed. Shit! Don't move! Don't move a fucking muscle! Ford. What the hell! I would have had him! Waste another bullet is what you would have done. Check that watch. This is the first people we've seen in weeks. So what do we do with her? I say we leave her. Come on. The Professor wouldn't leave her. Well, the Professor isn't here. Yeah, but she's pretty messed up. If we leave her, she could die. That's not our problem. Please, help me. Let's take her home. Oh! I wanted to grab that watch. They're back. I hope they found something interesting. They did. Where am l? Um, you're in a hospital. Hospitals aren't safe. No, no, this one's-- This one's clean. No. Hey, hey, hey. You should just-- You should just stay and relax because you might have some internal injuries. We don't-- We don't know. We're not sure. You're in a hospital, but none of us are doctors. Anyway, um... You're lucky to be alive. Wait. My boyfriend. I'm sorry. We still have a couple of month's rations left, but we need to save them for the winter. Hey, Professor, any chance we can get some hamburger on the menu? Now, Ford, all we got is soy and vegetables in the near future. Such bullshit. What's the point of being a carnivore if all we can eat is rabbit food? Any other questions? The new girl. What about her? What are we gonna do with her? Maybe she'll stay. We don't know anything about her, man. She might be useful. She's cute. We got enough mouths to feed. And we don't need anybody else. We don't have time to take care of her. I'll take care of her. Oh, I bet you will. What is that supposed to mean? I agree with Ford. Me, too. Do I get a vote? You should be resting. I'm okay. What's your name? Neon. Let me introduce you to our group. This is Dakota, Nova, Yukon, Victoria, Ford, Torino. This is Viper. This is Max, and I'm Darwin. Hi. In the year 2012, the gasoline ran out. You could almost hear the giant sucking sound as the last drop of crude was pumped from the earth. Within a year, the reserves were gone, too. We were supposed to have That's what the experts said, and...they were wrong. Detroit was still churning out gas guzzlers even as the wells went dry. You'd have thought we could survive without gas. But the end of gasoline meant the end of electricity, nuclear power. There's coal, but you still need trucks to deliver the fuel. No electricity means no refrigerators, and that means spoiled food. In days, grocery stores were picked clean. Within weeks, there was looting, rioting, and chaos. The government had a plan, but it was too busy trying to stop the violence. When they finally declared martial law, it was already too late. Civilization collapsed into anarchy. The smart ones moved south... until they realized that millions of other smart people had the same smart idea. All those people in one place fighting for the same shelter and food. It was a bloodbath. Within three years, more than 2/3 of the world's population had starved to death, frozen to death, or slaughtered each other. The American Dream became the American nightmare. So...what is this? Red Cross rations. Disaster-relief meals. We found, like, 30 cases of them here. We cook them. Makes them last longer. Wait until you try Dakota's acorn pancakes. Screw you, Ford. So what's your story? - Me? - Yeah. What are you doing here in Philadelphia? My, um-- my boyfriend and l were on our way to Florida, and we heard there was shelter and food here. You were misinformed. Yeah. Is that good? Don't bother. She's retarded. Ow! You bitch! That hurt! Jesus. Nova is not retarded. She just doesn't speak to anyone. That's retarded. Ford, you got chores to do, right? So how long have you been here? Almost a year. You're not moving south? No. A lot of people are going to Florida. There's too many people. Not enough resources. It's a war zone. We're better off here. In a hospital. Yeah. We have a good chance here. We have a lot of rooms. Large water supply. The building's tall and safe. I mean, we can house a lot of people here, working together to try to... create a new life. - A new life. - Yeah. Start over. Begin again. Like a Phoenix rising from the ashes. What about you, Neon? You got any special skills? You know, anything you can do to help out around here? I'm actually pretty good at fixing things. Really? 'Cause we need a lot of stuff fixed around here. - You feel up to working? - Yeah, sure. All right. Hey, you guys see Victoria? She's supposed to help me with those barricades in the lobby. I thought you were supposed to be fixing the water purifier. - I just thought-- - Clean water's our top priority. Well, maybe security should be. Hey, we're safe. We should be prepared. Besides, I'm sick of working on that damn thing. Viper, would you please just fix... the water purifier! Neon, why don't you go with him. Maybe you can help him out. Sure. Maybe I should keep an eye on them. I think that's a good idea. I'll watch Nova. Viper. You got to be fucking kidding me. Don't even start. The guy's a tool. He means well. Let me guess, he gave his whole "Phoenix rising from the sun" thing. Ashes. Phoenix rising from the ashes. Whatever. But yeah, he did. Come here. What? Come here. No. Okay, guys, I think I got it. Kid, I don't care how good you are at fixing things. It's never gonna work. Busting my ass on that thing for weeks. You're wasting your time. Excuse me. I had a good feeling about that girl. She's gonna be a valuable asset to the group. What about Viper? What about him? I think he's gonna be a problem. He'll be fine. I don't know. Has anybody seen Victoria? Uh, she's been a little out of it lately. You know how she gets. Oh, yeah. All right, well, look, today's assignments, um-- Dakota, can you go down in the basement? Check on the medical supplies, do an inventory. Take Torino with you. Yukon, we need some more water. Viper, it's your turn to haul out the pails. Ho! Shit detail! Max, how about some more firewood, man, okay, for the still? No. I'm gonna work on the barricades. You know how it works. We all take turns. Get Wonder Girl here to haul your shit, man. But it's your turn to take out the pails. I'm not your slave, dude. I'm sick of taking your orders, too. Hey, Viper, we're all sharing the work here, all right? You're no different from anybody else. - Oh, is that right? - Yeah. You know, because I've never seen you haul shit. And I've never seen you get your fucking hands dirty. Viper, we all know that he is very busy. Yeah, fucking you. Hey. - That's enough, Viper. - Suck it, asshole! Asshole? He's the asshole. Are you okay? Yeah. There's nothing you could do. Did you see how the others were looking at me? I've lost their respect. It's not true. Everyone still respects you as our leader. Nothing is gonna change that. This is mostly just trash in here. Looks like all the good drugs are gone. Yeah. Can I ask you something? Sure. You think he's coming back? - Viper? - Yeah. I don't know. I don't think so. I know he's difficult, but I kinda feel safer when he's here. It's like he'll protect us. Darwin will protect us. Oh, come on. The Professor's smart, but when the shit hits the fan, I'd rather have Viper here to protect us. That might come in handy. Look at all this blood. I mean, there's no way somebody's walking around after losing that much blood. Who's not accounted for? Who's not here? Victoria. She wasn't in her room. Neon. Where's Neon? I'm right here. What's up? Where's Darwin? Has anyone seen Darwin? Oh, God, no. Where's the body? He's not dead. There's no way he's still alive. He's not dead. I'm sorry, honey, but he's gone. You know, you're all pretty quick to write him off. He could be alive. He could be out there, and he can need our help. There was a lot of blood. I just don't-- No. Why? What purpose would it serve? We needed him. Nobody would have wanted the Professor dead, right? Right? Well, somebody killed him. Well, who? Who would have done something like that? That's what I wanna know. Well, I didn't do it. Well, neither did l. Not me. What about Viper? The guy's pretty pissed off. Oh, come on. Viper was an asshole. He wouldn't have killed the Professor. Well, then who, huh? What about her? Where the fuck were you last night? Yeah, Neon, where were you? I was sleeping, like the rest of you. We don't know a damn thing about her. She could be a killer. Come on, Ford. She doesn't look like a killer to me. Look at her. She couldn't hurt a fly. Why would I hurt the Professor? He took me in, no questions asked. He stood up for me. What-- Why would I want to kill him? What good would that do? You know what? This is stupid. I'm going to look for the body. Uh...the Professor, I mean. Yeah. Me, too. What is it, honey? Yukon! Go! Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Jesus Christ. He'll calm me down. This ain't your lucky day, buddy. And I got some bad news for ya. It ain't gonna get any better. Who the hell were those guys? I mean, do you think they're the ones that took the Professor? Okay, I'm going out after them. I don't think that's a good idea. If we leave right now, we can still catch up. I don't think that's such a good idea. Max, I'm gonna need you. The three of you stay here. Look, you don't know what you're dealing with. Neon, do you have something to say? 'Cause right now would be the time! Okay. I didn't tell you guys everything. Well, tell us now. Look, the real reason that my boyfriend and I are here is we were running. From what? From them. They're Rovers. What's a Rover? They're cannibals. They eat people for food. What are you talking about? They killed my family. They killed my friends. They-- They ate them. What do you mean, they ate them? I think I'm gonna be sick. So why are they here? You remember when you rescued me? The man who attacked you. He's one of them. He's a Rover. So you led them right to us! Neon, you could have told us! I'm really sorry. I thought we were safe. Well, how many of them are there? A dozen, two dozen, more. Shit. Okay, what are we gonna do? What are we gonna do? We need the Professor. Yeah, well, the Professor's not here. All right. Well, we're gonna fight. You didn't see the size of those guys. They're huge. We got guns. We had guns. So what are you saying? I don't know. I just don't wanna do anything stupid. You calling me stupid? No, I just-- I think maybe we should think about hiding. I-- Okay, I am so sick of this bullshit. We need to make a stand now! I-- I don't know. Torino, what are you talking about? Are you gonna listen to this? I don't know. I don't know what to do. I think we need somebody to tell us what to do. - We need the Professor. - Okay, okay. Well, the Professor is dead, so let's move on. - Then we need a new leader. - So let's elect one. Fine. I'll be the leader. No, I think Neon should be leader. She's not even one of us! She seems to know a hell of a lot more about these Rover people than the rest of us. So let's vote. Okay, let's vote. Who wants me to be the leader? And who wants Neon to be the leader? Well, that's a tie. Nova doesn't count 'cause she's a retard. So, Dakota, make a choice. I can't do this right now. You have to! Who's it gonna be, me or her? Come on, Dakota. Neon. Fuck this! Then it's settled. Dakota! Dakota! Wake up. Come on. - What's the matter? - Hurry. Holy shit. Look at them all. What are they doing? Why are they just standing there? I think it's a scare tactic. Yeah, well, it's working. How many do you see? I count, uh, 14. And there's five of us. Five against 14. That's not good. No shit, Sherlock! How many ways in and out of here? About a dozen or so, maybe more. It's a big hospital. - So there's no way to keep them from-- - No. What do we have in the way of weapons? We got the pistol, the rifle, and a couple of knives. That's it? Yeah. Well, Viper took the bow an arrow. What are we gonna do? I say we leave. We wait till the sun sets, we take our chances, we sneak out. It'll be dark. It's a big hospital. They can't possible cover all the exits. We'll think of a place to meet back up-- Don't you think it's a better idea for us to stick together? I mean, safety in numbers. We are completely outnumbered. We have nothing in the way of weapons. They're stronger than us. You wanna stay and fight, or do you wanna run and hide? Okay. Let's run and hide. Your family. What happened? We were living in a grocery store. Couple of the families from the neighborhood. We had aisles of food and supplies. There was about 20 of us. I'm not even sure when it started. People just started disappearing. We noticed it was like clockwork. Every night, they came and took one of us. You didn't fight back? We tried. There was too many of them. They were too strong. The funny thing is, they only ever took one at a time. Why? I don't know. I think it was because dead bodies rot faster. They were keeping us alive for fresh meat. Oh, my God. Yeah. You wanna know what the worst part was? It wasn't watching my family and friends die, seeing them slaughtered in front of us. It was the waiting. Waiting for dark. They always come at night. Well, I'm not ready to die. It's starting to get dark. We should split up. Good luck. You, too. You promise you'll protect me? Yeah, baby. It's time to go. Maybe we can just hide. No. We're gonna go out the back of the hospital. We can sneak out. No one will even see us. Okay. What about the others? Fuck the others! Every man for himself. Come on. Let's hide here, okay? What's the matter? We can do this the easy way, or we can do it the hard way. I don't really care which way. But by sunrise, I'm gonna be gnawing on your bones! Help me! Help me! Well, well. Are we really gonna leave them? Yes. You're being such an asshole. They would do the exact same thing to us. Okay, maybe they would, but I wouldn't. Fine. Oh, God! God! Catch you later... pretty thing. They're leaving. You see anybody else? They got Max. Is he, uh-- I don't know, I couldn't tell. He wasn't moving. You guys, it's Ford! He's been attacked! Hurry! That should help with the pain. How is he? Well, uh, I'm not a doctor, but, um... he's got some holes in his stomach, and he's lost a lot of blood. Is he gonna live? I don't know. Um, the stomach is one thing, um... but his leg... is... Oh, shit. Oh, my God. I, uh-- I think that's it's broke in two. Well, can you fix it? Fix it? No. No, I can't fix it. I wouldn't even know where to start. We need a doctor. We need a doctor. I don't think he's gonna make it. We don't have a doctor. So can you just-- Can you do anything? Can you help him at all, Dakota? Just-- Just do something. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I'll, um-- I'll do the best that I can. Okay? How's he doing? I pushed the bone back in. I had to cut a piece of it out. It's, uh... Are you okay? I'm exhausted. I'm going to go to bed. Are you scared? Me, too. But... I promise you that I'm not gonna let anyone hurt you. Okay? You trust me? Hush, little baby, don't say a word Mama's gonna buy you a mockingbird And if that mockingbird don't sing Mama's gonna buy you a diamond ring And if that diamond ring turns brass Mama's gonna buy you a looking glass And if that looking glass gets broke Mama's gonna buy you a horse and cart And if that horse and cart fall down You'll still be the sweetest little baby in town It's Ford. He's hurting pretty bad. I think he needs another shot. Okay. How is he? Well, he's not feeling any pain. I gave him three shots. Three? Isn't that too much? Isn't that gonna hurt him? How am I supposed to know? I'm sorry. So what's your plan? Plan? Yeah. What are we gonna do? I don't know. I'm sorry. What do you mean you don't know? I mean I don't have a plan yet. Well, you need to come up with one. We can't fight them. There's too many of them. We can't run. Ford's running days are over. Well, I would just really like to know what brilliant idea you are gonna come up with next. Run and hide? Is that the best thing you can come up with? Do you have a better one? No, but I would just like a plan that does not involve one of us getting killed. Why don't you try being leader? See how easy it is. No, thank you. I do not want to be the leader. I am already the doctor. I just don't want to die. You think I want to die? Look, we're in this together. We'll come up with something. Yeah. You better make it fast. Because in five days, we're all gonna be dead. - You're awake. - Yeah. How are you feeling? Just dandy. It looks better, right? Yeah. See? You'll be better in no time. Guys, we have three hours till it gets dark. I don't know. I say we separate out. We try to find places to hide in the hospital. No. No. We are not gonna split up this time. Okay, that's good. Now what? We barricade the doors, flip over the tables to hide behind, and then we shoot every one of those fuckers that walks in here. You know we can't kill them all. Maybe not, but I'm not gonna go easy. None of us are. If they want dinner, they're gonna have to pay for it. Are you with me? Yeah. Yeah. Torino, go get the rest of the needles for Ford. Bring a rifle. Take Nova, too. You got a problem with this? Are you the leader now? I guess so. - Shouldn't we vote? - No. You stopped being the leader the minute you stopped caring about whether we live or die. What's that supposed to mean? It means, Neon, that you have been zero help since this all started, and I don't know what your problem is. But it really seems like you don't give a shit whether we make it or not. You know what? You're right. What's going on? You haven't figured it out yet? And I took you for bright. Figured what out? Okay, I'll spell it out for you. I'm one of them. One of them? You're a Rover? Just think of me as a wolf in sheep's clothing. And that makes you the lambs led to slaughter. Why? I'd love to say there was some higher purpose here, but frankly, it comes down to food. You can't do this. People don't eat other people. We do. Do you have an ounce of humanity left? This is survival of the fittest, sweetie. We helped you. Yeah. You're weak. We saw you coming. We preyed on your weak nature. You deserve whatever fate you get. What's going on? We're having a discussion. About what? - Dinner. - Run! Now get up. Come on. You're coming with me. That's it. So everything you told us was a lie? That whole story about your family? No. Actually, most of it was true. That's how I met the Rovers. They were brutes. Inefficient, unorganized, desperate for leadership. They needed me. So I sold out my family. You sold out your own flesh and blood? I ate them, too. You're disgusting. If you want to survive, Dakota, it's best to be on the winning team. I'm gonna kill you. Not if I eat you first. Move. Hey! We'll go back for the rest tonight. Leave her for last. Okay, let's go. Lobo, look after her. I feel so cold. Just hang in there. Hang in there. What is it? Is someone coming? Is it help? Okay. Baby, you're gonna have to run and hide. Baby! Baby? Torino! Baby. Nova, listen to me. You have to go. God damn it, listen. You need to find some place to hide you. Do you have a place, some place good? Good. Now go there. No matter what happens, you don't come out. You're gonna be okay. Just go. Hey. How did you do this? Followed you here. We have to hurry. Why? We have to get back to the hospital before they do. - No we don't. - Nova is still in there. We're not gonna be able to help her. Hey! There's a half a dozen of them and two of us. I'm just not liking the odds here. I don't care. Wait. You shaved. Yeah. I like it. Shut up. Shut up! We'll be eating in a couple of hours. Nice, tasty meat. Yum yum. Shit, they're already here. We've gotta get them out of there. Okay, fine. How? I have an idea. Can you kill him from here? Yeah. Can you play a trumpet? What? Dakota. Where's Nova? She's hiding. All right. Um... Don't. Just-- Just go. I-- I can't move. Just find her. She needs you. What about you? I just want the pain to go away. God, this is so wrong. It hurts so bad, I can't even feel my leg. Fuck, I can't even feel anything in my body. Do it. I don't want to be chopped to pieces by two-bit ass clowns. Where's Dingo? It's a trick. Someone's tricked us. Forget the plan. Just kill the rest. Hello, pretty thing. Want to play a game? Hide and Seek. You hide, and I'll seek. And if I find ya, I'm gonna eat ya. Where are you, pretty? You enjoying the game, pretty? You little bitch! Open this door! Open the door! I'm gonna skin you alive! Open the door! Retard. Come here! Open this door! Take these bodies back to camp. Viper? Viper? I get the heart. Shoot him. Shoot him! No! Hey, you. Hello, Dakota. Don't come any closer. Let her go. Or what? You're gonna shoot me with an arrow? Yeah. - Really? - Yes. How good is your aim, Dakota? What if you miss? What if you hit a little too low? I won't. I'll slit her throat before you even release. Once again, it looks like luck is just not in your favor. Good-bye. How-- How did-- How did I do this? I drugged the bodies. You ate them. Oh. Survival of the fittest. Say hello to the winning team. Bitch. For better or worse, this is our world. Not the end of life and not the beginning, either. Just different. We live in the light because society tells us to. But we are all children of the dark. Laws are the only thing that separate us from savagery. Because the beast is there inside all of us, watching...waiting. When civilization is no longer there to protect us, when the beast is the only thing standing between us and death, we will absolutely fight tooth and nail to survive.
