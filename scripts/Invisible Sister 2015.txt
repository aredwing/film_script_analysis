But there's also all this stuff that we can't see. Like sound waves or gasses. And a few things we miss because they're hidden in plain sight. Like I said, invisibility is all around us. Even in the most obvious and familiar places. These opposites exist side by side. The seen... Hey, Molly! ...and the unseen. This is the time And the same pattern repeats itself. Over and over. Your life is waiting Those bright, shiny objects, they soak up all the attention. While at the same time, the invisible objects right under our noses don't. Your life is waiting And as you fall That's just the way things are. We can't change it. No matter how much we might want to. At least, that's what I thought. Mr. Perkins. Fancy seeing you here. Well, I really hope you were meditating on the marvels of science and not rocking out to Fitz and the Tantrums again. Oh, well, actually it is The Hives today, in honor of those skinny jeans you are only slightly too old to pull off. Ah, look at that. Not so fast. Yeah, I got your pitch for the semester project. Really? Turning a papaya into a battery? I've already got seven other kids turning vegetables into batteries. In my defense, papaya's a fruit. Mm. Well, your proposal is officially rejected. George gets all A's and you're letting him study how a guinea pig reacts to an all-ice cream diet. - It gives them terrible gas. - Yeah, thanks, George. Make sure you put that in your report, okay? That's it, Mr. Whiskers, no more Rocky Road for you. I want to see you challenge yourself. Do something relevant. Maybe something to do with transformation. This is the same matter in two distinct forms. One state is dense, dull... Much like this conversation. The other is transparent. Brilliant. I'm assigning you a new experiment. Figure out what that substance is, then transform it into its crystal state. And how am I supposed to do that? Build a homemade spectrometer. Yeah. You're gonna have to do this little thing that we in the science community like call science. You think The Hives became The Hives by shutting out the world and listening to their headphones all day? No. They got out there. All right, my point is you never know what you can accomplish unless you engage the world a little bit. And as an added incentive, I've decided as of right now, this is worth half your class grade. - What? - Mm-hmm. Check out whatever gear you need. You've got till Monday. He wants me to make mystery gunk into a crystal. That's impossible. It's not technically impossible. It's sound like "time-travel impossible," or "speed-of-light impossible". It's just... hard. George, why are you wearing clown pants? These are vintage lounge slacks. They're all the rage in Budapest, which is the new Paris, by the way. Girls dig these pants. At least six girls have noticed them. Okay. One girl noticed them. And that girl was you. Just now. Whoa! Nice vampire outfit, freakshow. But Halloween's not till tomorrow. Really? "Vampire outfit?" Is that all you got? Is it because of my cape and my pointy teeth? Code red, code red! C-Dog approaching. 11 o'clock. Be cool! - What? - Hey, Cleo! Carter, my man. What's the ups? Lay the good news on me. - How's it going? - Good. I... I was just wondering if maybe you wanted to study together - for Perkins' next quiz? - Who is that? No idea. Yeah! Yeah, totally. We could be a clich, how fun. I'm sorry, clich? The sports guy, asking the nerdy girl for help with his homework. No. I just thought we could, you know, join forces. Uh... okay. I'm going to be in the lab for study hall tomorrow. If you have a change of heart, stop by. Your epic crush just asked you out on a date, and you shut him down. That wasn't a date, George. That was just a crafty jock trying to weasel his way out of doing any actual thinking. No thanks. I'll leave the mindless flirting to my sister. "Awesome city! So the bomb!" Cleo! Speak of the devil. Hello, car full of beautiful women. School's done. You know what that means. Fro-yo. YOLO. Oh, no. Let's go! Yeah! - You wanna come with? - Yes! No, thanks. I'll pass. Darn. Come on. It'll be awesome city, totally the bomb. Thanks, I'll pass. It's Thursday! They're gonna have salted caramel! Come on! Yeah. Your buddy can come too. This is George, Coug. You've met him 400 times. Sorry, small dude. My bad! Still a pass. Catch you later then, sis. All right, let's go! Come on. I'll give you a ride home. I've got the big scooter today. I made a few modifications to it. Really souped it up. All right! Give The Coug a paw! Aw, yes! - Honey! - Yes? Did you pack my charger?! It's in your dopp kit. And I printed the boarding passes. There it is! - It was in my dopp kit! - Yeah. Do they even know you're here yet? Give them a second. Oh. Hi. We were afraid we were going to miss you. - Hey, George. - Hey, Cleo's Dad. I'm gonna get Whiskers all settled in. I'll see you inside. Okay, remember, set the alarm on at night. Don't touch the thermostats. And there are protein shakes if you run out of food, Ok? Honey, I am so sorry we're gonna miss the big lacrosse game. No worries, Dad. There'll be others. Yeah. But the first game always sets the tone for the season. - College scouts will be there. - Ohh! - Just remember, keep that stick up. - Stay loose. Keep that middle line open and cross if they pickup a team. And you... Stay loose, you know, with your studies and stuff. I'll be sure to do some rigorous stretching before I tackle my homework. - Okay. - Okay. Bring it in, team. - One, two, three, family! - Family! Bye, girls. - Bye. - Bye, Mom. - Bye! - Bye, guys! Oh, I forgot to mention, I'm having some people over for dinner tonight. Molly, you can't. I have to focus on my science project. Who's coming over? Just a few girls from the lacrosse team. The whole team. And their boyfriends. And anybody else who wanted to come. Hoo! Hoo! Sad but true! The Fightin' Owls are hunting for you! Does anyone know what goes in meatballs? - Meat, babe. - Huh. This is hopeless. I can't even get light to pass through it. Did you try diluting it? Yes. I can't believe I've been exiled out of my own house. I don't think you were exiled so much as "gently displaced." You know what I suggest? A break. We head inside, sample some meatballs, see if maybe one of your sister's teammates has a penchant for shorter, less athletic, but very intelligent, men. You should go, George. Go get some food. I'll still be working. You're a good person. Trick or treat Feeling kinda creepy I don't mean to brag, but I'm a bit of an athlete myself. I was one of the top lawn bowlers at math camp last summer. You know they call lawn bowling the "gentleman's polo". - I like horses. - Me too! I love horses! Love them! What are your thoughts on guinea pigs? Let's see what happens if I turn up the heat. Now we're getting somewhere. Sucrose. How sweet of Seor Perkins. He gave me sugar. Shoo! Get out of here. Ahh! Ahh! Oh! Uh... Move! Oh! Damn! Had a little oven-temperature misfire, but all good now! Coming through! Excuse me for just one second. Hey, what's going on? George, I made a moth disappear! Ooh! Ooh! - What?! - I know this sounds impossible, but it's true. I don't see it! Where is it? - Do you see that? - Uh... not really. Thanks for coming, guys. Get some rest. We have a big day tomorrow. No! No, no, no, no, no! No! Bye, guys. On the bright side, the lacrosse girls dug me. I got a bunch of digits. You got no digits. I got no digits. But I did enter my number into Nikki's phone while she wasn't looking. That's something. I made a moth invisible. You believe me, right? I believe... you probably should get to sleep. I'll see you tomorrow. Ugh. Ahhhh! Molly? Molly, are you okay? Where am I?! Uh, you're in the bathroom. No, I'm not. I'm gone. What do you mean, you're gone? Um... Molly? - Molly, where did you go... - Exactly! Where did I go? I don't know! I don't know where I went! - Cleo! - Ahh! I'm not in the toilet! This is just a bad dream. Wake up, Molly! Wake up! Okay. There. Now, I'm going to remove this towel and be awake and everything will be totally normal. Ahhhh! Ahhh! - What are you doing? - Calling for help! And what are you going to tell them, Molly? I don't know! That I've disappeared? I'm invisible? I can't see myself? You're right. They're gonna think I'm a crazy person. Okay. This is going to sound insane, but I think my experiment spread to you. What are you talking about?! I made a moth invisible last night. - You what?! - I was working on a sugar solution and then I just spilled a bunch of chemicals into the mixture and then a moth flew through steam and it became invisible. Did it land on you or touch or did you swallow it? You're asking me if I swallowed an invisible moth? Actually, there was something. It something in the bathroom in my water. It was really weird. It was sorta bug-like. Gross. The bathroom window was open? Yeah. I think so. Okay, so what if the moth was attracted to the light and then it flew into the room and then fell into your water? Where I accidentally drank it? Are you kidding me?! I accidentally drank your invisible science project moth and now I'm invisible too?! Hello? Happy Halloween, everyone! Oh, man! Yo, next time The Coug says he's gonna eat 26 meatballs, you tell him that's too many meatballs. Oh, no. Your boyfriend's here. Oh. Hey, Cleo. Hi, Coug. You're... a bear. Sure am. Didn't Molly tell you? We're all going as a big Wizard of Oz team costume. I'm the Cowardly Bear. - It's a lion. - What's a lion? The Cowardly...? Never mind. Uh, is Molly ready to roll? Um, no, she is sick. And she's in the bathroom. And you can't see her. Oh, no. Was it the meatballs? Molls? Babe? Are you okay? Oh, not really. Cleo's right. I'm really sick. You're our Dorothy! Let me take a look at you... No! I'm very contagious! Nobody can see me. Literally. Go, Coug. Save yourself. Quick! Go! Quick! - Bye! - Bye. - I guess. - Bye. Wow, Molly, your boyfriend. Two words: "Cowardly Bear." Can we maybe not mock my boyfriend right now and instead focus on the crisis at hand? Okay. You're invisible. How and why are you invisible? - You tell me. - I don't know. If it spread through your body this fast, it's extremely soluble. It should only take a few hours. A few hours?! I think. I hope. Okay, listen, Molly, I have to get to school and figure this whole thing out. And what am I supposed to do? Just lay low. Call in sick. I can't! I can't miss school today! Wait. It's Halloween. Really, Molly? I think your friends can survive Halloween without Dorothy. You don't understand. Today is the first game of the season. If I don't go to all my classes, I can't play. This is what you're concerned about, lacrosse? College scouts will be at that game. This is my only chance for them to see me. And my teammates are counting on me. I can't let them down. I can work with this. Maybe with a little make-up and some gloves. Cleo! The invisibility must... spread. So I anything that I touch will gradually become invisible too?! I don't know, Molly. Yes? So there's absolutely no way I can un-invisible myself? - I have an idea. - What? Yup. We're the same height, we sound the same, we'd have the same skin tone if you ever learn to moisturize. This could totally work. This is insane. There is no way I'm going to pull off pretending to be you. I'll be there coaching you. Come on, Molly. Even with the hair and the makeup, I'm still me. A mask, really? Dorothy didn't wear a mask. We're in New Orleans. Just say you're Mardi Gras Dorothy. Mardi Gras Dorothy? Yeah. From a big Munchkin Town parade float, with Munchkins giving beads and stuff. Look, I've gotta go to school today. So you've gotta get me through this. Get your science gear and do whatever it is you need to do to figure this out. Just please help me get through my day until I can be seen again, okay? Besides, you look totally cute. - Fine. Give me your car keys. - What? Molly, you're invisible. You can't drive. Well, you can't drive either. You don't have a license! This is crazy. What if we get pulled over? How do we explain this? Relax. It's going to be fine. Sorry. Just talking to my invisible sister. She's a really amazing driver. See? She probably thought this was one of those self-driving cars. If you could see inside of me Everything that I could be Yeah This is never going to work. Dorothy should've made better life choices. "Oh, there's a tornado coming. I'm gonna go put on my party clothes." Come on, you'll be fine. Don't walk like you. Walk like me. Stand up straight. Look more cheerful. Wave. - Hi, molly. - Hey, Molly. - Hey, Molly. - See? - This is totally working. - Hi, Molly! Okay, here's the real test. If Nikki buys this, everyone will. Okay, act natural. But... act like me. Act like natural me. Molly? Yes. Oh, Molls! I'm so glad you're here! I thought you were sick. Uh, yeah, - I am still very sick. - Oh. But I'm a bit better and I'm still quite pale and my voice is a bit different. But, you know, Nikki, it's okay. Awesome city, right? I... I love the mask. The mask. Uh, right. Well, I am Mardi Gras Dorothy. Hmm, cute. Molls, I'm totally freaking out. Arianna Burmeister is also out sick, so that means I'm totally in charge of Romp the Swamp tonight. And I don't know what to do or if we have enough decorations. Please, just tell me everything's gonna be okay. That actually sounds awful Nikki, but I would just cancel. Are you okay? Uh, I am fine. I just have a little neck twitch this morning, but it is okay. Molls, you're here. But I thought you were sick. - She got better. - Hey, that's great! - Give the Coug some sugar. - No. No, that is eww. Um, I am very contagious. So I will see you around. Bye. Molls? Did I do something wrong? Um, no, no. It's-It's my disease. Hey, George. You're not at school? No. I'm-I'm really sick. Your sister's here. She's like some freaky carnival milkmaid Zorro. Hey, Molly! Uh, yeah. Yep. She is Mardi Gras Dorothy. She looks totally smokin'. What? Eww. George, can you please just cover for me today in Perkins' class? You got it. All right, Molly, we have to go get to the lab. No. First period is starting. I can't be late. And what class is it, Molly? Intro to Conformity? Intro to Geometry, room 42. Come on. C-minus? Molly, if you needed help with line segments, you could've just asked. Right, because you're always so... warm and supportive. Okay. I have to go get to study hall so I can get a big compound microscope and figure this whole thing out. Actually, I'll grab it for you. You have to get to Pep Circle. Pep what? That was weird. A thing we do on game days. Just bonding and trust-building. It's a pre-game ritual... that you are leading. Trust! Teamwork! Fellowship! Pride! A team united can't be denied! Whoo! Who puts the pep in Pep Circle? We do! Please don't make me do this. Molly! You made it! Molly! Molly! I've warmed us up. We're totally ready for you to take over. Oh, well, that's just great. Um, so let's just go straight into the first thing then - which is the... - Group hug! Or we can skip the first thing! Okay... Oh. Oh. Next thing on the agenda. The circle of trust. Right. So let's circle up and do some trust. You can have the bunny. The bunny? The bunny of truth. Well, the bunny of truth. Um, Nikki, could you please remind us all what the rules are of truth bunnying? Whoever holds the bunny gets to safely say something true and meaningful to clear the air before the game. Well, then Nikki should start us off. Oh, okay. Um... Okay, I'm so grateful to be on a team with all of you. If I am strong, it's only because I'm surrounded by such strong women. And I'm especially grateful for Molls. She's always there. No matter how crazy my life gets, she gives me the friendship and support I need. She's an amazing friend and the captain. - Yeah! - Thank you. I also want to say one more quick bunny truth, and that is that I'm really mad at the people who invented weather apps because don't you wanna wake up every morning and be surprised at what the weather is?! Yeah. Your turn. Well, my truth is that I am so grateful to be sitting down because this dress is a serious chaffing hazard. Okay. Now for your... emotional truth. My emotional truth. That would probably have to be that I am fine. I am great. Thank you, Nikki. Molly, this is your safe place. You can trust us. We love you. My truth would be... I'm not the girl that everybody thinks I am. I'm not the beautiful shining star that everybody suspects. I'm actually more of the person that nobody notices, or nobody pays attention to. But... this is probably why I'm so uncomfortable here. But, guys, this is-this is all in my head. Right? Because I'm awesome city Molly. I mean, the bomb. Anyway, that's my truth, which is actually, weirdly, true. I think that deserves another group hug! Um, okay. All right. Yep, yep. Love you too, okay. Carter. My hombre. - How's the guinea pig? - Still farting like a chainsaw. I can't figure out why. Because there's talmitic acid in the ice cream. It's reacting with ascorbic acid and turning it into a fat. Ascorbyl palmitate. They can't metabolize the fat, - so you end up with the flatulence. - How'd you know that? I was a Governor's Scholar in Chemistry last year. Really? A Governor's Scholar in Chemistry? - That's, like, crazy amazing. - How about we keep it between us? You know, it's not really something I like to advertise. Hey. Do you know if Cleo was planning on showing up? I'm sorry, man. She's actually sick today. But I know she might've maybe wanted to be here, maybe. Can I ask you something? What's Cleo's deal? Whenever I talk to her, it's like, you know... and... and she's kind of... Never mind. It's cool. Uh, good luck with the guinea pig. This is actually amazing. Oh! Okay! - Gotta go, guys. Bye. - Molly? What are you doing? Did you get the microscope? Forget about that! Some really cute guy in the science lab was asking for you! Oh, that's just Carter. "Just Carter?" He's super cute and totally into you! No, Molly. I'm not the kind of girl that... guys like Carter are ever actually into. Come on. There's only one way to find out. No. Don't you think we have bigger things to worry about right now? I'm not going to go meet Carter, okay? That's final. Now if you'll excuse me, I have a massage circle to lead. Aah! Meatballs! Meatballs! Ohh, coming through! Coming through! Coming through! Mayday! Meatballs! Lots of meatballs! Why did I eat so many meatballs?! Watch my fur, dudes. Here goes nothing. You can do this, Molly. Just hold your breath, get in and get out. Gross. Uh... is there a chick in here? Uh... No. It's me, a dude. In the stall. Doing my dude things. Mmm. - Carter! - Uh, yes? It's me! Cleo! - Sorry, who? You're... - I'm Cleo! - Cleo! You showed? - Yep! Sure did! - I thought you were... - Sick? Yes. I was. But now I'm feeling much better. And you're in costume. You hate costumes. Yeah, I know, but I'm working on this thing where I'm trying to relax more and be less judgmental and uptight. Are you sure you're okay? You don't really seem like yourself. Those pants look ridiculous on you. There's the Cleo I know and love. So, hi. We're hanging out. Yeah, I guess we are. This is great. I'm really psyched. - You are? - I know. I've probably been confusing in the past. A little grouchy, right? Mean, even. Let's just put all that behind us. Focus on the now. Maybe get to know each other. Tell me about yourself. What kind of stuff does Carter groove to? Oh, no. Oh. Uh... Actually, I have to run. But maybe we could go out sometime, like in a non-study setting. Like a real date. Wait a second, I... I'm not sure I'm hearing you correctly in that suit. Are you asking me out? Yeah. I am. What? Is that weird? Honestly, coming from you, a little. - A lot, actually. - What are you doing tonight? Tonight? Um, I'm volunteering at the school fundraiser. Romp the Swamp? That's my favorite event of the year! I'll see you there tonight. It's a date. Coug! Watch where you're going! It's not The Coug! Molly? What are you doing? So, you didn't miss your study date with Carter after all. - What? - I figured out a way to pretend to be you. - You what?! - Yeah. The bear costume was thick enough, so it didn't turn invisible. Well, at least, not right away. Anyways, I got you a real date. He's working at Romp the Swamp tonight. At least, I think it's a date. Honestly, it was a little hard to communicate, being in the bear suit. Oh my! Bear. With no head. - Headless bear. - Oh, no. Molly? What's happening? I'm Cleo. No. You're Molly. No. That's Molly. No. That's a headless bear. Or an armless bear? Torso-less bear? Okay, I'm kind of losing my mind right now. George, calm down. Remember how I made a moth invisible last night? - Yeah. Well, it flew into Molly's drink and now she's invisible. - Say something. - Hi, George. How are you? Fine. Are you okay, Molly? I'm good. This is amazing. And very scary. Who stole my bear costume? Oh, gotta hide! Molly! Wow, you are a sight for sore eyes. - Hey, little guy. - George. Of course. Someone stole my bear costume. Right out of the bathroom. Any of you guys seen it? Um, no. Nope, Coug. I haven't seen a thing. But it was so great talking to you. Awesome city. Um, I have to leave. So do you think, in exchange for me being cool and keeping all this a secret, you might put in a good word for me with your friend Nikki? You like Nikki?! That's so adorable! Nikki's a sweetheart. She likes nice guys. Just be yourself around her. Yeah, I find the whole "being myself" approach never really works out for me. Just give her a chance. She might surprise you. Molly Eastman? - Yep, that's me. - Yeah, I'm Mr. Perkins. Your sister's in my science class. Oh. Well, I have heard a lot about you. Uh, can I talk to you for a minute? Sure. Yeah, uh, listen, I know your sister stayed home sick today. Yeah, she's really, really sick, Mr. Perkins. - She has to stay home. - Yeah. The, uh, thing is, I went all angry teacher on her yesterday and I told her, well, she'd fail my class if she didn't deliver on her science project. I just want to make sure that she's okay. That the science project isn't the reason she's staying home. She's okay. Yeah. She is actually doing a lot more than you expected. A lot more. I'm pretty sure she's gonna blow you mind. Okay, that is great to hear. See, I knew she had it in her. - Thanks. - Your sister is one of the brightest kids that's ever sat in my class. She's got this potential inside her. You know, I think she could do great things in this world if she wanted to. If she would just get out of her own way. Yeah. Um, if she were here, she would want me to tell you that. She really doesn't want to disappoint you. Well, tell her to feel better. It was good talking to you. Come on. Yes! Cleo, shouldn't I have at least started turning visible by now? Yes. Which is exactly why we need to go home so we can figure this whole thing out. Wait. We're not going home now. But school's over. And the most important part of the day is starting. - Which is? - Lacrosse. Making me visible is gonna have to wait. I... All right, everyone. Five minutes until game time. Don't forget to buy your Go Fighting Owls T-shirts. I think I'm gonna sit this one out. - Yeah! I don't think so. - Molly, I cannot do this. I am going to get creamed out there. You'll be fine. That's easy for you to say. What? You think this is easy for me? I'm terrified every game. I can hardly sleep the night before. I have to drink ginger fizz just to untie the knots in my stomach. Well, then why do you do it? Well... I like being on a team. When everyone's around me, my nerves settle. And I don't feel alone. It's like, when I'm a part of something bigger than myself, - it makes me better. - Hmm. Hey. You can do this. I'll be there with you, telling you exactly what to do. You ready to rumble, Molls? We've gotta rock it, today. Uh, yeah, rock it! Totally. Okay, bring it in! Bring it in! Bring it in, ladies! All right, everyone. Go Fighting Owls! Okay, high school sports fans. It's the moment you've all been waiting for. It's game time! Owls! Owls! Owls! Owls! Your stick's upside down. Duly noted. Molly, move up! You're running the wrong way! - Come on, come on, come on! - Come on! Yes! Wow, slow and painful start for the Fighting Owls. - Let's see if they can recover. - It's okay, it's okay. Should somebody call an ambulance? You okay? That hurt more than anything in my entire life has ever hurt. - All right, come on. Get up. - Sure, just let me try and start breathing first. Molly, what's wrong with you? It's like you've never held a stick before! Uh, it must just be my cold. Hey, listen to me. This is my whole life, here. Those college scouts are my future. I can't lose today. I've got an idea. You got this, guys! And the visitors win another draw. - Great attack by the... wind? - Go! Come on, come on! - Power forward Molly Eastman. - Whoo! We're seeing some of her trademark wizardry out there with that ball. Pass it! Just like that, Owls are right back in this one, folks! - Yeah! - Way to go, Molly! The Fighting Owls have really picked up steam. Come on, Molly! They've got the visitors totally off-balance. Literally. Go! Go! - Yeah! - Whoo! This has been a very strong push by the visitors. They've clearly got their sea legs back. - Wh... - Come on! Come on! We're all tied up! Time out! Refreshment? Thanks. You know, there's some really complicated physics in lacrosse. I'm available for a one-on-one consultation anytime. What makes this drink so blue? Huh, you got me there. How you doing? I can't play. I just can't. I can't even feel my legs. Please, Cleo, this is it... All or nothing. See over there? This is my future, Cleo. I need this. All right, guys, everybody bring it in. Uh, good luck. Thanks, thanks. Okay, bye. Okay, guys, I know you are exhausted. I'm exhausted and in pain. A lot of pain. And I mean a lot of pain. But there is this thing I always say, which is when you're part of something bigger than yourself, it makes you better. That's what a team means. So let's get out there and have each others' backs, okay? Yeah! You guys, we can do this. - Right? - Yeah! All right, all in. - One, two, three... - Owls! Nice job. I don't know how you do this every week. What an absolute classic. We're all tied up, 30 seconds left. Time for one more play. Owls! Owls! Owls... What a pass by the Owls! I can't get to the goal, Cleo. It's all you, you got this. Go, Molly! Molly! Molly! Molly... Molly Eastman is now one on one with the keeper. Goal! - Molly Eastwood scores! - She did it! And the Fighting Owls win 8-7! You did it! Molly! Molly! Molly... Hold the slide steady so I can figure out what's going on with your cells. Okay, getting focused here. There's a nuclear membrane. - Wait. - Wait what? Is that a good wait or a bad wait? Your body, your cells, they aren't metabolizing the compound. That sounds like a bad wait. Why is this even happening? The original sugar solution must be turning into a fat and getting stuck in her cells. So what does that mean? We have to figure out how to neutralize the solution before her body could fully absorb it... Or the invisibility will become permanent. What? I thought you said this was temporary. It takes the human body 24 hours to fully digest something. Right. Okay, so when did you swallow the moth? Last night at midnight. That means we have until midnight to find an antidote. Or she becomes invisible forever. But where do we start? I don't even remember what I spilled into the last solution. So that's what we do first. We redo your experiment. Someplace where we can fully analyze it. A real lab. Like the one at school. Okay, we'll start with a basic sugar solution and keep adding chemicals until we get the right combination. Exactly. We'll know we got it right when the moth vanishes. We'll catch a moth. You head to school and start setting up the lab. Go, Fighting Owls! Yeah, this probably wasn't the right context for that. Where are we going to find a moth before midnight? - Come on. - I know the perfect place. Cool. A cemetery on Halloween! Great. The key to catching a moth is to be in the darkest place... ...with the brightest light. Moth... This is crazy. Where are all the moths? Here, mothy. Here, mothy mothy mothy. They're not cats, Molly. Whatever. Cleo? It's no big deal, moths. Must have just been the wind. I can get this back on in no time. Cleo! Can you see me? Yeah. It's nice to almost see your face again. Am I getting better? No, you're not. It's just the night mist glistening in the moonlight. I'm scared, Cleo. Me too. But it's gonna be okay. Look! I got this. Molly, I don't think this is a good idea. We don't have a choice, Cleo. This moth may be my only hope. Please be careful, Molly. I'm getting closer. Come on, moth! Almost got it. Almost there. - Hold on! - Come on, moth! Ohh! I lost it! Molly, are you okay? No! I am not okay! I am very much not okay. I am in a cemetery, at night, soaking wet, covered in swamp ooze, and now I'm gonna be invisible forever. - We still have time. - Just forget about it. We can't. We can't forget about it. We can't give up. Maybe we should just go home, leave all the lights on, - and try to draw a moth in. - And then what? You can reverse the invisibility? For sure? Because as far as I can tell, you really have no idea what's actually happening to me. I'm done. I'm done with your science and your judgments and your sarcasm. I'm done with all of it. Come on, Molly. This isn't you. You're supposed to be the positive one. Just leave me alone. If I'm gonna be invisible forever and have my life completely ruined, I want to face it alone. You of all people can relate to that. Come on, Molly. Molly? Molly! Come on! Come back! Molly! Molly? I don't know if you can hear me or not, but if you can... I'm sorry. I'm sorry about the sarcasm. I'm sorry about everything. It's just not easy... being your sister. You've got this thing... this light. Everyone is drawn to you. And it's hard sometimes... because... the truth is... that I've always wanted to have that. And when... I didn't... it was much easier... to blame you... for feeling... ...invisible. So... I pushed you away... and... everything... everything away. I should have come for froyo. You can come for froyo next time. Molly, you're here. I'm here, sis. You never saw me comin'. It's almost nine. We only have a few hours until midnight. Hopefully George has gotten everything set up in the lab. That would be great. Oh. Oh! Ohh. Ohh. Did you mean what you said back there? About always feeling invisible? I'm sorry. I had no idea. I get now how rough that would have been. The funny thing is, I've always been envious of you. - Me? - Because you're a genius. You get straight A's with your eyes closed. I kill myself and barely pass. You have other things going for you. Like what? Lacrosse? Popularity? Both are pretty useless after high school. Molly... that light I was talking about, it isn't because you're friendly or pretty or a good athlete, it's because... you make those around you happy. You see what they need, and you make them better. It's like the best kind of smart. You really think so? I know so. I've been you all day. Okay, there's just enough time to go home and get changed before we meet George at school. Finally! Where have you guys been? The building's locked. I don't know how we're gonna get inside. Leave it to me. I have an idea. That is why I do kung fu. I'm a black belt. Well, a brown belt. Oh, okay, I'm a yellow belt. But I am a very advanced yellow belt. Let me call you back. Hello? Anybody out here? Huh? Boo! Aah... No, no, no, no, no, no! Let's add a little more sodium... Okay, we got it. Good. Let's analyze it so we can figure out how to make an antidote. I don't understand. The solution's complex. This is heavy organic chemistry. So now what? We have to find someone who can sort through this. Someone who knows what all that means. Who? A governor scholar at chemistry. Believe it or not, it's Carter. - What? - It's true. I heard him talk about a bunch of crazy science stuff with George. Trust me, if anyone can help us, it's him. And I know just where to find him. Shake that body show me that la la Shake that body... Carter said he's volunteering tonight. He's gotta be in there somewhere. What's wrong. If I go in there, then Carter's going to know I like him. And I do. And he likes you too. We don't know that, Molly. If a girl like me lets on she likes a guy like him, then he usually ends up laughing in her face. If he did that, he'd miss out on the best thing that ever happened to him. Together we can dance Whoa we gotta do it do it do it baby, dance Shake that body show me that la la Shake that body... No outside food or drinks. School rules still apply. What are you thinking? Cleo? Oh, no. Um, hi, Coug. - Is your sister around? - No, she's not, but we really have to go. Wait, wait, wait. I just really need to know. Is Molly dumping me? No, no, she's just really busy. You don't have to protect me, Cleo. She's avoiding me. I mean, she loves Romp the Swamp. She'd never miss it. Would you just tell her one thing? Tell her I just want her to be happy. That's all I've ever wanted. And if she's happier without me, then I can learn to live with that. Somehow. The Coug's okay. He's not crying. Coug... I've never been the biggest fan of yours, but I was wrong. Hmm? Molly's really lucky to have you. And if you'll just give me a second, she'll be back. I just miss her so badly. I miss you too, Coug. Molly? I'm not breaking up with you. I'm right here. I'm just invisible. Like you can't be hurt? No, that's "invincible", babe. I'm "invisible". I can't be seen. This is very confusing. Oh... Oh! Molly, it is you! Oh, I missed you too. Thank you for not dumping me. Whoa, whoa, wait. You're invisible? Wait, what? How? This is completely crazy! Coug, I'll explain later, but if we don't find Carter now and make Molly visible in less than an hour, you're going to go to prom with an invisible girlfriend. Which won't make for great couples pictures. Right? Right. Okay, let's split up. I'm gonna go to the yard, and you go into the house, and we'll meet in the barn at the end, okay? Okay, yeah. Let's go. Have you seen Carter anywhere? Have you seen a guy named Carter? Uh-uh. You go in there. I'm gonna go this way. Oh, uh, excuse me, do you know where Carter is? Soccer player, about this tall, luscious curls? George, have you seen Molly? Uh, "seeing" is really the tricky word there. We're out of snacks, the bowl of fake eyeballs turned mushy, the smoke machine ran out of whatever makes it make smoke. Molly is supposed to be here. This is a complete disaster. Nikki? Yeah? It's not a disaster. This is the greatest haunted house fundraiser ever. Really? Definitely. Oh, are you having a good time? See? She's happy, and she doesn't even have a head. You're doing a great job. Thanks. You're a really... really nice guy, George. Thanks. You're nice too. Maybe we could hang out sometime? I'd like that. Uh, great. To be continued. See you soon. Carter! Can you guys give us a sec? Hey... you're here. You're late, but here. And you're not in costume. Um, no. Costume? Your bear costume? Um... No. Can I ask you something? What's up with you? I mean, generally, you're kind of standoffish. Today you're actually nice to me, and now you barely even bother to show up. Carter, I'm so sorry about the weirdness. The truth is... I have always wanted to hang out with you. And I never thought that you would want to ever hang out with me. What are you wearing? Uh, I'm... I'm honey. Honey? Yeah, you know, I thought, 'cause, you know, with your bear costume, I'd... I'd be honey. 'Cause, you know, bears and honey are... They're kind of a... thing. I... I literally spent all afternoon gluing felt. But, you know, since you're not in costume, I... I may have overthought this a little bit. I really want to talk to you about this, and I want to talk to you about a lot of things. But right now, I really need your help. What is it? You should just not see for yourself. It's just over here in the barn. Isn't the barn off-limits? Carter. Hey. Hello. What's going on? Okay, here we go. Hey, Carter. Whoa, Carter, Carter, Carter... Wow, this is a sophisticated solution. But I think I can work out an antidote. The problem is we only have 45 minutes. 'Cause at midnight, we're toast. The tricky part is after we create the antidote, - we need to distill its steam. - Of course. The steam is what turned the moth invisible, so that's what Molly needs to drink. But how? We don't have time to get to the lab. We can make a homemade still. All we need are a few simple components. Hey, sorry, fire code violation, gotta take this. A heat source... some tubing... Sounds better without these notes. ...and a funnel of some kind. Ok, so now that we've created the antidote, all we need to do is boil it... then distill its steam... so that Molly can drink it before midnight. Okay, here we go. It's almost midnight. We've got 40 seconds. Is it working? Just one drop... and another one. This is gonna take forever. 30 seconds. Oh, come on, boil faster! Hey! Open the door, people. - It's Perkins. - Ignore him. Whoever's in there better come out, or you're gonna meet my good friend, Mr. Detention! Less than 20 seconds. Come on, work, you stupid machine. - Come on. - What's going on in there? Okay, Molly, this should be enough. Drink it. Seriously, open up! People, your actions have consequences. I have to do something for you first. What are you doing? It'll just take a second. You kids are in some serious trouble! Mr. Perkins, it's Molly. Cleo turned me invisible for her science project. You have to know how special she is. Oh, no. Molly, what did you do? I had to make sure Mr. Perkins knew, Cleo. You did something amazing the world had to see. We missed the deadline. It was a risk I was willing to take for you. Molly, I'll never see your beautiful face again? That's okay, we can still have a life together. Maybe even with little half-invisible kids someday. So you actually did this? You really turned your sister invisible. I... I... Okay, I can't get my mind around... around this. Uh... No, no, we can't give up. There has to be something else that we can do. Your calculations were conservative. There should have been enough time, it should have worked. Well, then, there's something we're missing. Molly, did you eat anything weird last night? Meatballs. Huh? Meatballs. Wait, you had a game the next day. You were nervous. Ginger fizz. I drank some with the moth. Then that's what we're missing. Its acidity must have impacted the solution somehow. Do you have any on you? I never leave the house without it. Drink it. Hey, no matter what happens, I really liked spending the day with you. Me too. It's nice to see your face again. It's good to see you, too. Some kind of magic I think The Coug needs to blow off some steam. Molly! Finally! Hey! Where's your costume? Hi, Nikki! Wow. You finally took your headphones off, Cleo. You did some real science. Maybe a little too real. Listen, I chaired the New Orleans Association of Applied Scientists. Would you please come and present your findings with us next month? - Yeah! - Yeah? All right. Thank you. Hey. Look, I know it's been a crazy night. But... And I'm dressed as honey. But do you want to dance? Yes. The sun is shining It's a brand new day So as I was saying, invisibility is everywhere. But as it turns out, the line between visible and invisible, it isn't that wide. I'll be okay Transformation from one state to another is indeed possible. I know now that visible things can disappear... ...and invisible things can finally be seen. Most stories have a hero who finds You make your past your past Yeah, you make your past your past Crossing this line between invisible and visible is easier than you think. The sun is shining What people see... ...what they really see... ...visible or invisible... ...comes from inside us. And we become visible when we are not afraid to show the world who we really are. I can remember A time when I was so afraid When even my shadow Wouldn't follow me So I-I I'm picking up my sword To shatter all the pieces that I was before 'Cause I-I I'm worth fighting for For, for, for Throw me in a cage Lock me in a room Throw away the key I dare you I'll break down the walls A high heel wrecking ball And I won't let you tear me down No I won't let you tear me down No-oh-oh-oh
