The blitz lasted 15 minutes, killed 800 people... ...and 80, 000 Rotterdammers lost their home. The City of Rotterdam thinks there are only a few unexploded bombs left. They don't pose a danger to public safety. The bomb disposal squad will blow up the fire bomb soon. The Blitz is the worst thing that ever happened to me. But if I could do it all over again, I'd still move to Rotterdam. And, as a baker's assistant, deliver bread early in the morning. I'd still have fun with my brother until the day... ...Eva crossed my path. I'd still put on a monkey suit... ...and line up obediently. Keep quiet with my head held high... ...to be barked at by wealthy customers... ...like Eva's future husband. For as long as my future wife stays here, she can't lack for anything. Got that? I wouldn't care how her fianc behaved. Because thanks to him, she entered my life. A classy lady. Congratulations, Mr Lagerwaard. Her? She's older than my mother. I wouldn't change anything about those first few days in May, 1940. Otherwise I'd never have met her. Welcome, my love. I'd kiss you somewhere else entirely. Looking for trouble, moron? Welcome, Frau Eva. -Thank you. We wish you... We wish you a beautiful wedding. - Your German is wonderful. Let me show you the way. My parents? - Left Hamburg this morning. And my brother? - The payment has been accepted. We lived in two separate worlds. Eva in luxury... ...and I with holes in my socks. Under normal circumstances, we'd never have met. Everything to your satisfaction, madam? - I expected tulips. Dad, will we get a present? But sometimes fate lends a helping hand. One wrong button and suddenly she looked at me. I'll never forget that first look. That was very kind of your new mom. She's got remarkable eyes, right? - Who? That slutty maid? - No, that German woman. Just wait till we get to America. Beautiful women with beautiful eyes. Enjoy them to your heart's content. What's so remarkable about her eyes? - They're not just one color. They're blue and grey and a bit darker on the outside. The pupils are black as coal. - Coal? Remarkable. Time for the final in the open weight class between two great guys. They're both good in a brawl. The first prize is nothing to be sneezed at. It's a boat trip to the United States of America... ...sponsored by the Holland-America Line. We're going to America, you and me. That ain't nothing, ladies and gentlemen. In the left corner we have a bag of bones. With light blue trousers Vincent de Graaf. Punch back! Keep steady. Stay covered. May 10, 1940 I understood why Eva wanted to marry a rich Rotterdammer. Rotterdam was a bustling port city with a lot of prospects. No one was worried. The Netherlands wasn't bothered by Nazis and war. Our country was neutral. OK, so our army had mobilized. But what could happen to us? Nothing, right? Thanks to her upcoming marriage, Eva was all set. My brother and I were poor wretches. But we were cheerful and not afraid of anyone. Then our paths crossed. Hurry, OK? Good morning. You're out early. Going for a stroll? My German is impeccable, right? The Willems bridge! Where is the Willems bridge? - I honestly don't know. Sorry. To the left, right and then straight ahead. - OK, thanks. We don't have enough ammo. - Don't whine, fight. You speak Dutch? - My mother grew up in Rotterdam. I lived in Utrecht for the past ten years. Now you're wondering what an Utrechter is doing in Rotterdam. Where are you going? - The White House. Want a lift? Aren't you afraid of war? - No. We remain neutral. That thing is huge. Can you get all of it in the picture? - 43 meters high. The first skyscraper built in Europe. In New York the buildings scrape the sky. Late 19th-century design. My father designed the parquet flooring. Shall I take your picture? Wind it. The other way. That's right. Smile. Germans! -it's just an exercise. Fire! Reload. Aim. Fire. We have to go to Hotel Atlanta. - Get out of here. It's dangerous. Fire! Reload. Aim. Fire! I want to get out. Run. My grandma always says: When people are afraid, make them laugh. Do you ever laugh? Hitler's going to kill everyone. - lt won't be that bad. You probably don't read the papers? - I read The Fist, as it happens. The Fist. Some communist rag? It's a boxing magazine, with exciting pictures. Pictures... Yes, pictures. Ladies and Gentlemen! You won't believe your eyes! The strongest man on earth lifts an elephant! Ain't no ocean deeper. Ain't no mountain higher. Ain't no elephant heavier. Yuck, that stench. The strongest man on earth slain by a fart. But you did laugh. - I laughed at you. Makes no difference. Pleased to meet you. Eva von Heerle. - Vincent. Vincent de Graaf. Pleased to meet you. BUSINESS AS USUAL INSIDE The Krauts captured the south bank. - Hope they burn in hell. Your fianc is waiting for you. You better hurry inside. Thanks and... ...see you later. - You won't. We're leaving. Forever. To America. - Well, good luck then. I forgot the birthday cake for Dirk's youngest daughter. I'll take care of it. Eva, finally! Are the children safe? - Why wouldn't they be? The invasion. - There is no invasion. Waalhaven Airport is in German hands and there's heavy fighting on the bridges. My friends in authority talk about skirmishes. A misunderstanding. Nothing to worry about. Our wedding can go ahead on Tuesday. Eva? I ordered the cake. May 11, 1940 I didn't understand why Eva was so frightened by that invasion. Queen Wilhelmina called the invasion brazen and improper. But the queen announced that she and the government were in command. So I thought that things would be all right. I continued my life as if nothing was wrong. I tried to banish Eva from my mind. My brother demanded all of my attention. Well, gentlemen, here you go and here you go. Two third-class tickets for New York. Leaving on Tuesday. There's just one small problem. You have to depart from London. - Why? I'll tell you why: Your boat isn't coming here. They're afraid they'll be shot to pieces by the Krauts. Don't look at me. It's not my fault. How will we get to London? Swim? - Listen... A fishing vessel captain has his boat where no Kraut can trace it. He wouldn't mind taking you to London, but not for nothing. How the hell do we come up with that? Easy, Chris. - 150 guilders? This way we'll never get to London. So how will we get to America? When are you going to America? When we have enough cash to go to London. The sooner the better. Sell those boat tickets and buy a gun to put me out of my misery. Chris... ...you'll get that surgery. Uncle Cor, 150 guilders is just a tip for you. We'll pay you back in six months. - Boys, you'll never manage that. It's no use having dreams above your station. I believe in the American Dream. - Get to work. Be glad I got you this job. You can't go out alone at night. - Leave me alone, please. You can't go out without a chaperone. - Then come with me, Aunt. Let's go and have some fun. I need fresh air. Good evening. Eva, there's a war going on outside. - So what? Come back immediately. How about if I accompany the lady? Then you can get some rest. You can't go chasing broads now. We need the money. I've got an idea. - Your ideas only cost us money. Vincent, we have to be on that boat on Tuesday. Right, Chris. Tuesday. Your chaperone, with Aunt Anke's blessing. - That woman drives me nuts. With her etiquette all the time. - 'Eti - ' what? Rules. What you can and can't do. Especially can't. Does etiquette allow you to have a drink? No. It might not be such a good idea. - Why not? This is the front line. - Are you afraid? No, I'm worried about you. - I already have a chaperone. Do you know of a good caf? - Of course. My treat. - Get down. OK, now. When are you leaving? - On Tuesday, but... But what? - Could I talk to your fianc soon? What about? - Hey you, identification. We're going to the cafe. - The Germans occupied the bridge! We're going to stop them. OK, identification. Don't have it on me. - Where are you from? I know her. She's staying at the Atlanta. - And my mother is from Rotterdam. German? Guys, we've got a Kraut. No, she's getting married in a few days. - You stay out of it. Guys, get her. Let's get out of here. Let go of her. Thank you. You're a nurse? I'm used to taking care of my brother. Is he a boxer too? - No. Does it hurt? It's unbearable. Those who are about to die, salute you. I have one last wish. - What? Smells good. - What? My dying breath? That cigarette. You don't smoke, ma'am. There's a first time for everything. And stop being so formal. What do you want to ask my fianc? Well, Chris and I have a problem. We don't have the money for the boat trip to London, so I thought... ...maybe we can borrow it from your fianc. So it's about money. Dirk doesn't like to lend money. But it's for Chris. There's a surgeon in New York who can help him. Without it, he'll die. When you deliver that cake tomorrow, I'll put in a good word for you. Oh my God! May 12, 1940, Whitsunday Eva turned out to be braver than many a Dutch person. She didn't run away. The Germans didn't cross the Maas river... ...so Eva's fianc didn't think there was a reason to panic. The day after the wedding, she'd move straight into his mansion. Was I just as brave as she was? No. But I had to help my brother. From your father's collection. Wenge wood from the African jungle. - Oh, beautiful. I find old oak from Eastern Russia the most beautiful. Who wants communist flooring in his home? Come on. And from America: a refrigerator. With the latest of the latest: a freezer compartment. What is that? - Lettuce. Stays fresh for six months. Incredible, right? The kitchen. And I've got something especially for you, Eva. A modern gas oven. It would be nice to replace this wall with a window overlooking the garden. Why don't you cut the cake? Outside on the patio, Willem. - There's no one to help me. I'm sorry. All the servants left for Limburg like dumb sheep. Rotterdam is much safer. - I'll help him. Dad, can I have two pieces of cake? - As much as you want, sweetie. Mr Lagerwaard, can I ask you something? You can ask me anything, except for money. Excuse me. These gentlemen are looking for Miss von Heerle. We received a phone call from the police in Doesburg. They have arrested your father. All German nationals in the Netherlands are arrested right now. And my mother and brother? - We're not at liberty to tell you. You have to come with us. - Miss von Heerle is my fianc. We're getting married on Tuesday. This will be her home. I'll phone my esteemed friend, Mayor Oud. Your names, please. - One moment. If you can guarantee she won't run away... - Of course. Besides, we don't need to run away. I have a bomb shelter. We have to go to Doesburg right now. - No, it'll be over in a day. Two at the most. - That's two days too many. We can't leave because of the wedding preparations. I can't get married with my father in jail. - I won't postpone it. You can't expect me to get married without my parents and brother. Willem... ...drive to Doesburg to pick up Eva's family. To Doesburg? Behind enemy lines? - I'll arrange the necessary papers. No one knows what the situation is. We're at war. There's nothing to worry about. I'm sorry, sir. I'm not going. - Willem, don't you dare... Where are you going? Come back immediately. You go, Dirk. You can... - I can't. Things will go to the dogs here. Then I'll go. - You're under house arrest. What? - How much money does it pay? Look, it even has a radio. - Right. Make sure you're back in time. Tonight. Order the tickets for the boat to London. - Yeah. Drive. - Does Mr Lagerwaard know... Drive! You don't know my family. You might pick up the wrong Germans. If Mr Lagerwaard finds out... - He won't. He's in meetings all the time. And Aunt Etiquette? - Hey! You need the money, don't you? Now what? Can't we leave the city? - We can. Your husband got us a letter of safe passage. No one will stop us. Drive! Stop them, stop them! Be careful and don't trust strangers. The Germans use spies... Where did you learn to drive? Someone of my social standing shouldn't be able to? That's not what I said. - It's what you meant. My father was a taxi driver. - Was? He's on a merchant ship now. Somewhere in Asia or Australia. That far away? So you never see him? - No. That seems awful. You want your family near you, don't you? I see my grandma in Utrecht quite often. And you've got your brother. How come you know so much about his lung disease? Because of interesting pieces in The Fist. Watch out! Keep going. Keep going! Bunch of creeps. You can't trust them. I'm not so sure. I had the feeling they wanted to help. Life is simple for you. Because I'm working class. - That's not what I mean. That's why I want to go to America. I won't be riff-raff there. In America everyone's equal. Here I'm a nobody. I don't find you a nobody. Is that a German plane? It's a Stuka. Underneath the car. - Too dangerous. Come. Stop. Tomorrow morning. - Can't you do it now? Please, we're in a hurry. - Not on the Day of the Lord. Certainly not on Whitsunday. This is for you. Thank you. Thanks for helping us. Can't you really fix the car today? We're going to church. Come on. You can clean yourself at the pump outside. Eva ! Close your eyes! - What's wrong? Close your eyes. Promise. - Scout's honor. You can open them now. And leave. Sit down. Does it hurt? -Yeah. Those who are about to die, salute you. It's a real boxer's massage. - Is it? Stand up. Keep moving. It prevents bruising. We need the Nazis against the Communists. - Hold on. The Krauts seized all of our companies in Poland and Austria. That entire war is about money for them. Our money. Then do what I do. Get a German business manageress. You've got guts. A woman as a business manager? I'm marrying her as well. My first wife was Jewish. So a protestant German woman can't hurt. Just some extra insurance. A German woman who's your boss. That's asking for trouble. There's nothing she can do to me. She needs me more than I need her. She looks after the children and keeps her nose out of the business. The fact that she's young isn't a problem either. Are you the owner of a car with license plate number H 2531? Yes, that's one of my cars. The occupants, a German spy named Eva von Heerle... ...and her side kick Vincent de Graaf, are traitors. Do you know these people? Have you seen them before? You're a good singer. - Thanks. From the radio. It was a waltz. - A what? A waltz. You must know what a waltz is. I know what a malt is. A waltz. One, two... a dance. Come on. Does the etiquette allow this? - Aunt Anke would get a heart attack. Good. You've never waltzed? - Never. You've got talent. Chin up. No more pain? - No. She went along with the boxer to pick up her family. Oh, no. Car trouble, maybe. A flat tire? - Come on. They've buggered off to Germany. - Or theyre lying in a haystack. Call the Doesburg police to have that boxer arrested. The phone exchange is broken. Smashed by our own army. Eva is innocent. That guy is a traitor. I'll get the necessary papers. I'll pursue them myself in the morning. The Netherlands can count on me. Uncle Cor, Vincent isn't a traitor, is he? - I'm not an idiot, son. I have to go and look for him, before he gets into more trouble. Does that bastard Lagerwaard know you're Vincent's brother? No. Good. Then I've got an idea. We hope You will send the Holy Spirit. To us as well. Not because we deserve it, but because we want to be your servants. Just as you announced the Consoler in the Bible, so do we hope for peace. Bless, oh Lord, our words... ...against evil and human malice. May all who dwell in it find their way... ...towards righteousness. May 13, 1940 The map says there's a route straight through the woods. To the left here. My brother knows this by heart. You're fond of him, aren't you? He's the sweetest, gentlest boy on earth. You're fond of your brother too, right? - Sure, but I do lose sleep over him. Herman can be difficult too. - And Dirk Lagerwaard? Dirk's under a lot of pressure. He's building an international empire. He doesn't want to lose it to the Nazis. So he marries a German at the right moment. It's not just that. - Course not. He's also wildly attractive. This is a government announcement: It's prohibited to use gas for personal... Guess the tune. Beethoven. - Correct! And this one... Herman always guesses this one. Don't know it. Is it classical? Why listen to classical music? Glenn Miller is much better than Mozart. How did you know it was Mozart? Louis Armstrong. - No, it's a lullaby. My mother used to sing it before I went to sleep. Then she gave me a special kiss. Like this... You peeked when we were praying. - I wouldn't dare. And when I wrapped myself in that towel? Tell the truth. What did you see? The same thing I saw with my eyes closed. You're lucky you're German. You may drive back. - But I want to drive on. My parents... Miss von Heerle... In a day the German army will occupy the Netherlands. I have to keep going. Please, my future husband is wealthy. - Are you Jewish? No, I'm not Jewish. - What about him? Is he Jewish? Identification. No, he's not Jewish. He's... ...a Dutch boxing champion. He might become a world champion. Right. Corporal! Yes, sir. - Do you know Vincent de Graaf? Dutch boxing champion. The Dutch Olympic and European lightweight champion is Bepvan Klaveren. I've never heard of de Graaf. Our corporal is a pro boxer by the name of Schloss. Schloss? I know him. Number five in Germany. And he's ranked number seventeen in Europe. Seventeen. But I'm better. If I beat Schloss we can move on to Doesburg. A boxing match? Now? - That bag of bones? With one hand tied behind my back. Propose it. What's he saying? He wants to know if you're afraid of Dutchmen. Afraid of Dutchmen? Where did you get that idea? Of that amateur? But you're hiding in the woods? Miss, we're waiting for orders from Berlin. Within two days the Netherlands will have been wiped off the map. Is that right? And yet you're afraid of a Dutch boxer? Corporal Schloss, come over here. Schloss? He's strong as an ox. - And very vain. The first round was for show. Finish him off in the second round. Drive him crazy. Dance. It's a boxing match, you know. Dance away, so he has to come after you. That will make him furious. And then: Barn! Beat him into sauerkraut. Dancing and sauerkraut. What's one more? Dance, dance. Drive him crazy. Trust me. Dance! Well done! Stand still, asshole. At your command, lieutenant. - No! Madam... ...have a good trip. What? - Nothing. "Stand still, asshole." Eva didn't know the difference between good Dutchmen and collaborators. Since the invasion, the roles had been reversed. The good Dutch people hated all Germans. I didn't. How could I hate Eva? She no longer treated me as a servant, but as an equal. At least, when the two of us were in the car. Is that your parents' car? Full of spelling errors. This lady has a letter from the Mayor of Rotterdam... ...requesting the immediate release of the Von Heerle family. Looks good. - It's fine. Guys, the Germans have broken through the Grebbe Line. Come on, they're almost across the bridge. You have collaborators working for you? - City council... ...has a policy of non-discrimination. We don't engage in politics. As long as they don't touch this wall. It's for Our Majesty the Queen. - Exactly. Eva. - Mom. Eva. - Dad. My sweet girl. Where's Herman. - Don't be startled. Stay calm. Don't be angry. Herman, it's me. Let me try. Herman... Who's that? Our driver. Take it easy. No uniform? Civilians can't cross the Grebbe Line. - I have a letter of safe passage. I'll go and check it. Warn the Doesburg police. A spy and a traitor are trying to escape. They have to be arrested. Are you Vincent de Graaf? - Yes. You're under arrest. - What? Why? By superior orders. Treason. - That's a misunderstanding. I'm just a simple baker's assistant. I box a little in my spare time. Sir, this is a mistake. I'm not into politics. I leave that up to the bigwigs. Who said this? - We just received a phone call. I'm sorry. Hey, you have a tattoo. Herman, no. - If he enjoys it. A driver should just drive. - His name is Vincent, mom. A driver doesn't have a first name. What do you want to achieve in life? - Vincent is a talented boxer. Beating people up makes him happy? Boxers don't fight against others, but against themselves. It's a barbaric sport. Stop, stop! Keys! Stop that. Sir, we have to get... - Madam... Let me finish! Please, leave us enough gas. What do you think will happen to us if the Germans catch us? Three cheers for Fred's sucking power. We'll never make it to Rotterdam on this. - We have to. Maybe to Utrecht. - Eva, say something. Utrecht. The Von Heerles weren't allowed to leave without me. I came all the way from Rotterdam, right across the lines. You had clear instructions from the army. Letting Vincent de Graaf escape is treason. Why didn't you shoot him? Now my fianc is in mortal danger. - She'll be fine. Your fianc and that traitor got along very well. This isn't over yet. Come along. We'll wait in the car. Don't take too long. Vincent! - Grandma! Is this your sweetheart? - No, this is Miss von Heerle. She's getting married tomorrow, but not to me. That's a shame. A quarter for your hope chest. - Cheapskate. This was my wedding gift. Let's go, or well miss the streetcar. Appie made it himself. After me Vincent's mom received it on her wedding day. Grandma, we're in a hurry. Where can we get gas? Let's go, or well miss the streetcar. Don't mind him. He's losing his marbles. Gorgeous. Why doesn't your mother wear it? She can't. She's not with us anymore. I'll have a drink. A drink. - The 2.50 coin represents the husband. The guilder represents the wife and the quarters and dimes... ...the sons and daughters we hoped to get. I'm saving it for Vincent's bride. Why are you in such a hurry? Do you have to get married? Don't be embarrassed. Me too. My belly was this big. Grandma, gas. - Keep your flap ears shut. This is girl talk. I do have to get married, but not because I'm pregnant. I'm marrying to save my brother, Herman. The Nazis plan to exterminate all the mentally disabled. And Herman is a retard. - He's a mongol. They're such sweethearts. They crack you up. You do love, don't you? Your fianc. Otherwise it's useless. He's very reliable. He treats me and my family very well. - Good. We're leaving immediately. - Mother, it's nearly dark. We'll leave tomorrow. - But the gas? They might steal it again. - Vince will keep an eye on it. Right, Vince? Congratulations on your daughter's wedding. If you want... Ap and I can shove closer together... ...pillows on the oor... Plenty of room for everyone. Very kind of you, but my son doesn't like to sleep over. Herman is quite welcome too. We have relatives near here who own a hotel. Utrecht was buzzing with rumors. Some said that the German push had been halted. Others said that the invading army was camping at the city limits. And it was said that Queen Wilhelmina, despite her promise, had fled. People were afraid, according to Eva. Just as in the Middle Ages when the plague broke out... ...and everyone hid their fears behind insane celebrations. Maybe I was scared too. Not for the war, but for her. From Hamburg. My mother brought it for Dirk. Are you allowed to give this delicacy to the driver? They gave me the bridal suite, of all things. The most expensive room in Utrecht. But you're rich, aren't you? - We used to be. Didn't Dirk buy your father's company for a lot of...? There were unforeseen expenses. Hello! - Herman, be careful. That was a terrible institution. Poor little guy. I'm so glad he was released. - Released? Yes, thanks to Dirk's money. Your mother... ...when did she... - Fourteen years ago. Was she ill? - No. If you don't want to talk about it... - Sure. She was burned. Our house was on fire and my brother tried to rescue her. The smoke and the heat scorched his lungs. The cells are slowly dying. I wish I could... Dance! - Last dance in freedom. Come on, Herman. - Jazz. It's been banned by the Nazis. - Then this is your chance. Champagne. - You drink champagne? Usually after a win. Then I drink Vive Clique. Vive Clique? It's Veuve Clicquot. Tastes like dishwater with bubbles. Sorry. When I talk like that I'm just like my mother. How about beer? - Beer? I'm sure your mother doesn't drink that. Two beers, please. And turn. No! Easier than a waltz. Just follow your feelings. He's proud of it. That tattoo means he's been sterilized. - Leave him be. He likes it. Why are you marrying Dirk? He spent a fortune on getting Herman released. In exchange he gets my father's business. My parents and Herman get a house in Rotterdam. And you're thrown in as a present. - Not at all. I'll become his German manager. For me it means a career in architecture. That's been my dream since forever. And you think that will happen? - Yes. It might be a marriage of convenience for now. But who knows what the future will bring? What else am I going to do? Abandon Herman? What do your famous feelings say about that? You're taking your brother to America, aren't you? You're right, but still... But what? - It's wrong. Herman needs to go to bed. Herman fell asleep right away. I'm sorry. About earlier. Me too. My father is a drunkard. And a chain smoker. When I was nine, he let me smoke the butts from his ashtray. I smoked in bed as well. When my mom caught me, she became furious. "You'll burn us all alive some day," she'd yell. But I kept doing it on the sly. And I fell asleep. Luckily, my brother woke up in time. What does that idiot do? He rescues me first. You've never seen such an inferno. A complete chaos. My mother dead. My brother maimed. My father gone. It was an accident. Anyone who hears this story thinks: That guy is a murderer. You can't blame yourself. It was an accident. To me you are Vincent... ...who sometimes does stupid things, like everyone else. I want to show you something. You may enter. May 14, 1940 Could you have this ironed? There's no time for that in Rotterdam. - Of course, sir. Catch. Miss von Heerle? - In the bridal suite. Eva ! One moment. I'm coming. Eva, open up. - I'm coming. Why did it take so long? - I was still asleep. How dare you leave Rotterdam against my express orders. I promised you'd be under house arrest. - I had to save my family. Where's that traitor you like to hang around with? We leave in five minutes. Grandma! I want to borrow something from you. It's upstairs. In the dresser, I guess. I want to leave as soon as possible. Come on. Hurry with those suitcases. We don't have all day. Leave Eva's father and brother's suitcases in the Chrysler. Rotterdam, Rotterdam... Make sure you get gas. The nearest gas station? - There's no gas to be had anymore, sir. Not even on the black market. This is all your fault, Eva. If the wedding doesn't take place today, you all go back to Germany. And goodbye to the house in Rotterdam. - We still have gas. Fill up the tank. Immediately! Everything. - I have to get back too. Fill it up. - You may wear a nice suit... ...but you're no better than I am. - I already had a car when I was your age. I started outwith empty hands and I'm still not afraid to get them dirty. He's ill. God, my fianc takes pity on traitors, retards and the ill. Vincent is not a traitor. - Get in! You still owe my brother 150 guilders and me 25. Well, well, that communist boxer is your brother. Give those boys their money. They're leaving for London. Get in! - So who's driving the Chrysler back? And the rest of our stuff? - Eva, please. I'm keeping the money as security. You'll get it as soon as you deliver the car in Rotterdam. Sir, are you all right? Is there something I can do? Sir, Miss von Heerle left you a present. I'M SORRY Chris, what are you doing here? I'm looking for the prodigal son. Traitor. - Traitor? The wedding dress. They were in such a hurry they forgot it. The Dutch army leadership didn't believe the Germans. The threat that Rotterdam would be blitzed wasn't taken seriously. The commanding officers refused to surrender. Rotterdam's population didn't know what was in store for them. I knew what was in store for me. Eva was getting married in a few hours. And she'd disappear from my life forever. Your daughter will be a lovely bride. In your old wedding dress. I'm sure of that. Eva... ...sign. Now? - Yes. Children just played outside. They cooled off in the swimming pool and ate ice cream. The streetcar ran on schedule. The baker baked bread. No one believed in the impending doom. I wasn't thinking about a threatening blitz either. I just thought about Eva. Bomb shelter for rem' Why did she abandon me? The boat to London leaves in two hours. We'll bring the car back, get our money and it's 'so long, Rotterdam'. Vincent... please. Grow up, man. Eva is the first person who accepts me as I am. The first? Thanks a lot. What about me? She can join the back of the line. All that love-sick wallowing! Stop that. You have to help me. I'm your brother. The brother of a murderer. - Not that again. That's been your opinion ever since I killed mom. It's my fault that your lungs are shot to hell. At least dad's honest. He never wants to see me again. Dad! - She doesn't see me as an arsonist. But just as Vincent. She understands it was an accident. It was an accident, but... - "But!" There is not "but" for Eva. And what do I do? I leave her behind and take off for America. You go. The police might be inside. Wait, OK? Hurry. That boat won't wait. Vincent, what are you doing here? Eva. Son, believe me, Lagerwaard can just about kill you. You? - Where's Eva? She's not here. Let it go, son. They can't stand you. They look down on you. On all of us. Eva ! You and my daughter should have no further contact. She forgot something. My wedding dress. - Eva's wedding dress. Thank you. This is for you. Keep it. For your hope chest. Vincent! Eva! - Everything to your satisfaction, ma'am? I have to go down. Where were you? - Dirk came to get me. He threatened to send us back to Germany. And you're going to marry that jerk? Please, understand. I have no choice. And I have no choice but to love you. Eva, marry me. No. What about last night? - Go to New York. Forget me. Herman can come with us. He'll be safe in America. It's impossible. Vincent, why don't you get it? It's too late. It's too late. It's not too late! Eva? - Vincent brought my wedding dress. Give him his money and he can leave for New York. Forever. That's up to the police. - I'll only marry you... ...if you give him his money and let him leave in peace. Are you trying to blackmail me? We agreed on a church wedding for the children. It costs me a fortune, but I don't care. But that communist boxer doesn't get a penny. Please, Mr Lagerwaard, just pay those boys. OK? Then we can focus on the wedding. We don't want to miss that, do we? Come on, Vince, keep going. Eva will be fine. How do you answer? - I do. Eva Jozien von Heerle... ...do you declare before God and his Holy Community... ...that you will take Dirk Lagerwaard as your lawfully wedded husband? Do you promise to obey him, that you will serve and help him... ...that you will never forsake him, will live with him in Holy Matrimony... ...that you will remain faithful and will trust him in everything? How do you answer? How do you answer? Eva? Nothing to worry about. They'll discharge flares. And the planes will go away. Miss von Heerle, how do you answer? Eva, go ahead. May 14, 1940 Chris! Chris! Where are you going? - You go to the boat. Vincent, come! Anton, where's Eva? - Come on. Under that pillar. Quickly. Eva ! Where's Eva? - She's still inside that church. Eva? Where's Eva? The bride. Everyone out. Eva, come with me to the boat. Eva, stay here. - Dirk... Let go off me. Underneath the pillar. Dad, dad! - Girls, stay here. Come back. Eva ! Come back! - I have to find Herman. What are you doing in our house? - You have to leave. It's safe under the stairs. They said so on the radio. Come on, people. Don't be scared. We won't be beaten by a few little bombs. Courage! Sing along, people. Who said farewell Sing, guys! Shyly and with a laugh to his mother on the quay because he didn't dare to kiss her that street kid from Rotterdam Did you just get married? Congratulations. Kiss the bride. No ring? It's over. Hey, if you hurry you can get all the wedding stuff you need for free. I hear planes! There they are! I'll take them along to the boat. Mom! We're coming. We'll get you out. Come on. Herman has to get out first. Herman, let go. Herman! Herman, let go. Dirk! - Eva... Herman first. We have to go to the boat. And Aunt Anke. Dad, Anke is injured. Go away, you common person. Anton, we have to get out of here. Where are Dirk and Herman? - Went to his bomb shelter. Look, look... Herman would love this. Please, open up. Dirk, it's me. - Open that door. Dirk! Mom, dad, we're saved. Herman, back. - Herman, come back. Lie down! Herman! No! 'Eva! Eva, Eva! Eva ! No, no! Vincent. - Open that door! Let me out. Let me out. Save my family. Take them to the boat. How much money have you got? - Why? I can take you to the boat for London. - Come on. I'm not going without Eva. - Anton, come. Eva! - Come. Let me out. - Eva, control yourself. Think about the children. - I want to go to my family. We are your family now. - No. Calm down, Eva. Thank you. You're good with Herman. If you want... We'd happily pay for you. Chris! Well, he's still alive. This is for the best, Eva. Once this is over... We'll become a happy family. You love Eva, don't you? Then go and put that necklace around her neck. What use are you to me in America when your heart is in Rotterdam? Hurry up, man, before she forgets what you look like. Thanks, Chris. My doll. I want my doll. I'll go and get your doll. Ah, the welcoming committee. Cigar? - What's there to celebrate? The city center has been ruined. - That's the difference between you and me. Where you see misery, I see opportunities. Who's going to rebuild the city? Who's going to give my family a future? I am. - I'm offering Eva a real future. You, a baker's assistant? - Eva loves me. I know what happened between you in Utrecht. It doesn't matter. I've known Eva since she was a little girl. That little girl signed my contract. She'll do exactly what I tell her to do. Eva's not a little girl anymore. She'll marry me and then we go to America. She's staying here. With me. Vincent! My parents? Herman? - Safely on the boat. You're not going to destroy my children's future. Dirk, no. What are you going to do? Going to shoot me? Go ahead. Go ahead. You're easily replaced. No! Eva. Don't give up. I'll take you to a doctor. No, Vincent. Keep talking. Think about nice things. What are you thinking about? About that elephant. About dancing in the barn. What else? I love you, Vincent. Don't say that. When you say that, you give up. Don't give up. Don't say goodbye. We didn't survive the blitz for nothing. I'm not letting you go because of a... - Exploding cigar. Vincent... ...promise me one thing. Be happy- Even without me. We'll be happy together. Promise. Promise you'll be happy. Beautiful. That long face is the queen. To my grandpa it was my grandma. To my dad it was my mom. And to me... ...you're the queen. You want a balloon too, sir? - Yes. Attention! Three, two, one, zero. The Blitz is the worst thing that ever happened to me. But if I could do it all over again, Eva, I wouldn't change a thing. And again my love for you would be boundless.
