Your wedding suit, or what? - No, no... - OK, see you tonight. - See you tonight. - Yeah, Rita, one thing at a time, no? - Yes, slowly but surely, I guess... Carine, I... What are you doing here? Why didn't I know? - Maybe you could spare me a minute? - You know damn well what was agreed. And? Do they bite? What are you doing here? - Everything OK? - I brought you some things. Come. They have already found you. - Any perspectives? - I'm working on it. You'll need to... What's that? - Promotional present. - For whom? Thanks for the furniture. You shouldn't have. A garage box also costs money. And my Dad doesn't have enough room for all that stuff. - Did he enjoy the tapes? - Very. And? Thanks. - 092207481. That's correct. - No, put it a bit bigger. No, use the arrows. - And? - Not well. - Her mother's been ill three weeks now. - So go, I'll be fine. - How do I print? - Print? Like that. They have to be in bed by eight. Bye for now. - Bye. - Like this? Yes. Thanks, mate. Granny was a bit lonely all alone in her little house deep in the woods. So she was happy when Little Red Riding Hood came over with pancakes. Little Red Riding Hood had just finished picking flowers. And she knocked on the door... And Granny said: Who's there? Ramzi. - No, you're wrong, mate. - You're wrong yourself. You're not Ramzi. You should have said Little Red Riding Hood. - You're wrong yourself. - What? The wolf arrives first, then Little Red Riding Hood. - Right, maybe... It is eight o'clock. - But I have to pee. You've had plenty of time to pee. Now it's time for bed. - No, let's play some more with the gun. - No, go to bed. No. Stop it, put that back. And take that off. Hurry, get in bed. Come on. - No, no Riding Hood. To bed. - Little Red Riding Hood... Now go to bed, both of you! You must listen when Rudy says something. Right. And sleep tight.

Rachid says: Yes. - And her mother, is she OK? - Much better. - Were they quiet tonight? - Yes, yes. Not a sound. Here, take it. - No, no. - Please, Rudy. - Thanks. - Good luck. I swear. When you cut off a cockroach's head, it lives on another nine days. Really. - Did you try it out? - No, of course not. I read it somewhere. - Where do you read such things? - Do you know what it dies of? - A headache. - Starvation. - Starvation? - Yes, without a head it can't eat, see? - He no longer has a mouth. - You nitwit. I've got to go. Shall I come with you? - You'd like that, wouldn't you? - Yes. But I'm home in five minutes on my bike. - On my cheek, that's it? - Yes, on your cheek. Then what about earlier? Oh, that. That was a mistake. - A mistake? - Yes. Oops. A mistake. - Bye. - So long. - There you go. Good luck. - Thank you. Bye. Sofie Maenhout here. Just to inform you that one of our clients will come to work tomorrow. Thanks, bye. Good morning. - Have you registered? - I am new. - And you are? - Looking for work. - Your name. - Rudy. - Last name? - Vandekerckhove, with 'ck'. And you have recently moved to Ghent? You're not from around here. - Your accent. - Oh, right. First big city you stumbled upon? There's a lot of us. You'll be fine. - I have been living here for twenty years. - Really? Wow. And what was your last work experience, Rudy? - I have been out of a job for a while. - OK. They gave me a long holiday. OK. Do you have anything with washing machines maybe? With washing machines. Right. Let me check. You may be lucky. Here, look: Dishwasher for restaurant Pinocchio. - Or frying fat salesman? - Nothing with washing machines, then? Well, Rudy, you are not twenty anymore... - So? - What do you think? Frying fat is really not my thing. Do you have any night work? Let's try something different, Rudy. Can you walk with three plates? Just a second. What do you think? Something for you? Come, stand up. Let's give it a try, shall we? Yes. Right, hold the plate. Good. Your thumb is right, but the little finger... Stuff your plate, yeah? I don't do restaurants. All the jobs in their shop window? Do not believe it. It's all just publicity. - When did you go there? - This morning. Don't worry. A good craftsman always finds work. Not there, in any case. I added everything up yesterday. Things are getting urgent. Yes, I know. I'm working on it. - Can I give them your phone number? - What for? Washing machines. Take down their phone number, address, and machine type. But that's not very realistic. - Has my week's allowance arrived? - This is all that remains. Well, I say. Thanks. And date of manufacture. Ask them for that too. - Times have changed. - A good craftsman always finds work. Thanks for the compliment already hooked? Why? Most come once and they don't stay long... don't they? They only need five minutes... for what? What do you think? We don't just chat about the weather, you know... you can put on your blouse, if you want sorry, I can't too many clients in the morning secret wankers at work are you a student? Who knows? I'm pleased to have found you what's that? You're weird. Hello? Ah. Vicky? - You OK? - Yep. I tried to call you a couple of times, but eh... Yes? Aha... eh... - What are you doing? - Statistics. Want to go to The Pink later? - No, I really have to finish work, and things. - Everything OK? Yes, but it was late yesterday, you know. Yeah, but I enjoyed it. So did I. Sorry, but I really have to get back to work. Save some energy for me, will you? All right. - I'll call you later, all right? - OK. So long. Vandekerckhove? How are you doing? Fine. Long time no see, eh? How long have you been back? She has missed you, you know. Asks for you every night. Give her a good workout. How long have you been back? I asked you how long have you been back? Received my envelope? Liked it? What, can't you even say thanks? Do you have a light? You can't be serious. Of all people. Rudy Vandekerckhove needs a match. Hey, Vandekerckhove. Need a light? Hey, want a match? Need a light? Boy, that's hot. We are the world we are the children. Want a match? - Are you alright, sir? - Zelzate. - I beg your pardon? - To Zelzate. Goddammit. Carine? Can I come in for a second? You've got nerve to show up here. - Let me come in for a second. - I'm serious. If you don't clear out, I'll call the police. OK, so call them. Go ahead and call them. Go on, call the cops. They know who I am: Rudy Vandekerckhove. Vandekerckhove, one word, with 'ck'. - Had a fight? - No, I ran into a little deer. Rudy, please. You went to see her? Has anyone called? - What did she say? - Has anyone called? - Rudy, please. I asked you something... - Goddammit. I asked you something, too. I brought 'Fanny'. If you have time, Dad would be pleased... It's in French. Goddammit. 'Fanny'. The scenery represents Le Bar de Csar. It's 2 o'clock in the afternoon, in August. Outside, the sun burns on the harbour. It's me. How are you? You clearly don't want to see me, so I'll try this way. Open. Open up, will you? Wait, madam. Wait. It's always the same story. Yeah, it's an IPSO model. You've brought your tools. - What's all of this? - A machine in need of repair, sir. - Oh? And is it yours, or what? - If it were, it would open smoothly. - Keep your hands off, mate. - Says who? - The regional manager of Laundry Palace. - Pleased to meet you. Hey! - Are you fond of them? - What did you say? Who? - Your machines. - What's wrong with you? Shh. Wait a sec! She is not happy, you know. She needs a little more attention. You've got to take care of her more often. Put your hands on her, ask her how she's doing... And then? No more problems. - There you go. - Thank you. If you ever need a good craftsman, just give me a call. - Bye, madam. - Goodbye. Look who's here what luck... I just got here I was hoping you'd be back do you say that to everyone here? Yes... but with you I mean it that's kind were you angry last time? No... internet was down I waited a little... what are you listening to? Take a guess no idea... Madonna? Lots of work for school? No, I'm going to quit camming? With school maybe I can help I could send you some money every week you already are... how do you mean? You're my best customer you're on a long time, you give me 30 cents per minute can I ask you something? Sometimes there are men who want to meet... they offer lots of money... actually that would come in handy... Aha, mister Vandekerckhove? Good morning. Good morning. And? Your business generating a lot of work? Here for the frying fat job? You just missed it. Don't you have anything else? Anything, I don't care what. And why would I do that? I need money... Who doesn't? But it's urgent. Anything else? Thank you. - Rudy... - Yes? Do you want to see the world? Yes. Hello? It's me. How are you? You clearly don't want to see me, so I'll try this way. I've thought about what to say to you about a thousand times, but now... I went to see mom. Seven years is a long time, isn't it, Vicky? I've kept all of your letters. Thirty-four in all. That's right, isn't it? I live nearby now... Albatros Street, number 12. I don't know if you are still interested in your daddy, but... if you should... I'd love to see you again sometime. - How about coloured hair locks? - No. - It would suit you. - Mom, I don't live in Zelzate. - How is school? - Fine. Have you eaten? No, I have a date at eight in Ghent. - With whom? - You don't know him. Is he handsome? When will he actually be released? - Who? - Mom. The pope. - Have you heard from him? - I don't want to talk about it. - Yes, but maybe I do. - Since when does that interest you? - He is my dad, after all... - Yes, your dad. Not that I know much about him. - The less you know, the better. - Do you get to decide that? Yes, I do. Have you forgotten what he's done? - Has he tried to get in touch? - What? - You heard me. Has he tried to get in touch? - No. Don't lie. He came to see you, didn't he? - Mom, please. - I do not want you to see him again. Don't exaggerate. - What's all this? - What? You pervert! Bastard! And in my house! I knew we could not trust you. I knew it. - Easy. Calm down. - You know what he did? Calm down, will you? Hey! Calm down, I said. Let me handle this. You've gone too far. - Rachid, listen... - Don't Rachid me. Asshole. Go inside. A daughter to be proud of! Regards, Patrick. Rachid, open the door, please. Hey. Mate. Come on, Rachid. Open the door. You always said we were brothers. Well, we are brothers. Open the door. Let me in. - Hey, mate. Here's the place. - It's him I want. - No, that's not how it works. Where to? - Keep out of this, man. What did you say? Rachid, open that door. It's OK. Rachid, open the door. It's OK, OK. Fine. - Come on, Rachid. - 10 euros and 80 cents. Have you forgotten what I did for you back there? Eleven eighty. - Rachid, listen... - No, you listen. You've disgraced me in front of my family. My wife thinks I'm the pervert. - You've gone too far. - I had no choice. - You had no choice? No choice, Rudy? - No. Are you crazy, or what? Look here, Rachid. She's my daughter. Son of a bitch. If my wife sees me with you my marriage is down the drain. Patrick of the Viking Bar sent it to me with a little postcard: Greetings from your daughter, the whore. You know how it feels to hear such a thing? You should have told me sooner. We're no longer in prison, Rudy. Your computer is the only way for me to talk to her. - You must understand. - I have a wife and three kids, mate. - It is impossible. You can't do that. - Yes, I understand. I understand. You don't want to help me anymore. Thank you. Thank you, brother. Shit! - Who is it? - Rudy? I didn't ask for that injunction. Leave her alone, you hear me? Don't worry, you raised her very well. She does not want to see me anymore. - Are you surprised? - I've changed. Yes. I can tell. Maybe I can still make myself useful for her. As a father. You idiot, you're fresh out of prison. What are you going to do? Play daddy? She does not want to see you, you said so yourself. - She might change her mind. - What do you expect? 'Come in, have a seat. Drink?' After seven years? You can't do that, don't you see? - I only have one daughter. - Yes. Damnit! If only she knew. Her sweet daddy. Leave her alone, you hear? I wish you'd stayed in. Are there mice and cockroaches in your house? Between the walls, in the kitchen, in the bathroom? What can you do about it? With children, food and pets nearby... This is a brand-new, effective method to get rid of mice, cockroaches... if she finds out, I'll kill you I'm really happy you are back... I've been busy you're the only normal person here - why do you keep coming back? - No reason but I don't do anything... you do a lot don't you have anyone else? No wife, or children? No so I am your cure for loneliness? - I'm kind of glad to have met you. - Really? Yes... I guess so... you came at the right time... yes? Can I see you? Meet? Switch on your cam sorry, I've got no cam... - too bad... - Can I hear your voice? Why? Because I have no idea what it sounds like one moment... Can you hear me? Come on, Rachid, say something or I'll turn it off. Nice voice, just as I imagined it. Thanks. You look tired. Trouble at home. With your parents? No, with my mom. My father is dead. No, that's not true. I don't know why I am lying to you. My dad is not dead. He wants to see me. And you? I don't know. I can't sleep anymore... because of me? - Because of you? - Shit. No, because of him. And my mother does not want me to see him. What would you do? You're his daughter he loves you. - And Rachid is OK as well? - Yeah. - You were a fine couple in prison, eh? - Whoa, slow down. The only thing we shared was the toilet and that was all, OK? I enjoy cutting your hair here a lot more than inside. Are there others you keep seeing outside? - Only the hopeless cases. - Right, thanks a lot. Just keep it that way. Not too short in the neck, OK? Oh yes, a lady called earlier today. - What lady? - This one... But that's just round the corner. Why didn't you tell me? - How old is she? - You can't ask that, Rudy. The machine, Denise. - Where are you going? - To see that lady. - I told her you wouldn't come. - Why? You have a job now, don't you? You stupid cow. Go on, call and tell her I'm coming. Call her yourself. I'm not your secretary. - She's my first customer. - Rudy, be realistic for once. One washing machine a month isn't enough. - You've got a job, concentrate on that. - I see. You won't help me. - I didn't say that. - Then call her. - Rudy, please. - Yeah, 'please'. Have you forgotten whose sofa you're sitting in? - Whose TV you're watching? - Is that it? Is that it? Rudy has to be a good boy and sit on your lap, or what? Because you gave me some old furniture that still smells of your dad's sweat? Thanks, Denise, thank you very much. - But... hello there. - Hello. I thought you no longer existed. - That lady on the phone... - No, we still exist. But that lady no longer works for us. OK. Come in. - Where is it? - Right, come on through. Would you like a drink? Thank you, thank you. - A beer, perhaps? - You're very kind, madam. Madam. Please call me Chantal. Chantal, right. Or would you rather have a coke? Do you have coffee? - No, but I can make some. - No, don't bother. I better look at the problem first. - Yes, that will be difficult. - How so? I don't have a washing machine. Have you eaten? - Not really, no. - Well then, have a seat. - Here you are. - Thank you. You've got five minutes. And then you have to leave me alone. - Come, come inside. - No. What do you want from me? Nothing... I would like to see you. There. Now you've seen me. - Get out of the rain. Come inside. - No. Here. Wait. Would you like to get something to eat? All right. - Do you like it? - It's OK. When I'm hungry at night, I always come here. It's very good. - Had enough? - Yes. - You've put on weight. - Thanks. So how have you been? How do you think? Do you have a boyfriend? I'm really glad to see you. How about you? I don't know. I don't know you. - Still, for twelve solid years we've... - But you weren't around much, were you? - How is your mom? - Fine, I guess. Does she know that you are here with me? No. I don't understand you. I haven't heard from you for seven years... And then suddenly you show up in my cellar. - Do you understand? - Yes. To me you were dead. You kept it. - Is your hairdresser ill? - No. Why? - Still the same old cassettes? - Yes. - You should buy an mp3 player. - Cassettes last forever. - Are you doing anything Friday night? - Why? There's a Motorhead concert in Brussels. My treat. Will you come? Aren't you a bit old for that? Embarrassed to set out with an old fool, or what? Well then, come on. Now that's what I call music. - Why did you turn off here? - So we can listen a little longer. It startled you, didn't it? All right then. Till... I have something for you. - What is this? - For your studies, lass. - But I work for that myself. - Go on, take it. No, but I don't need it. It's a gift. It's the only thing I... Do you really think you can win me back with money, or what? No, I did not mean it like that, Vicky. I don't want it. - I don't want you to... - What don't you want? - Take this money and pay for your studies. - You have nothing to want, Dad. I spend eight hours a day in this damn fishbowl for seven euros an hour... and I am doing that all for you. Wow. Congratulations. - Vicky, stay... - Leave me alone. Stick that cigarette pack in Mom's mailbox. She is still paying off your debts. Aha, hello horny sweetlips no, baby, it's Franky for you I'll change my name into Rachid anyone seen Rachid? I'd love to suck them has Rachid been here? Assholes! What do you want? What do you fucking want? I'll show you. Is that what you want, eh? You want to see my tits? Here, suck on them! You horny bastards! Is that what you want? Stop it! Come on then, take it! Fucking assholes! I wrote three letters to her every week... and she has not seen a single one of them. How do you explain that? - Listen to me, Carine, I want... - You have nothing more to want. - It's... - Does she know about the letters? No, she does not. - She's not doing well. - How so? Just that she's not well. What do you mean, she's not well? Sorry, Carine, sorry. I had some soup left. Thanks. Madam Chantal has called again. She asked if you could come over. For this week. Thanks. Rudy, sorry about the other day. I shouldn't have said that. It's OK. Things aren't going well, are they? I didn't know you smoked. - Anything else I should know of? - No. Come on, Vicky. - I don't know everything about you. - No, that's just as well. - That's convenient. - What do you want to know? Did you ever love him? Please, Vicky. It's a simple question: Did you ever love him? Yes, I was crazy about him. He was a great guy. He was older, had his own house, a good job... He was funny, too. He had a nice body, too. And a motorbike. And I was fed up at home, so... - So never lose your head like I did. - Don't worry. I'm serious. Your studies come first. You don't have to worry about that, Mom. I've had a good example. What's all this? - The flower shop was closed. - Gosh, Rudy. Miele Novotronic: 1100 rpm. Second-hand, but still... - But that's not bad. - Not at all, it's a good machine. Can you set it up, too? Yes... but it's been a while. - Care for dessert? - No, thanks. - Did you like it? - Yes, yes. Are you always this quiet, or is it only with me? Careful, women think that's sexy. - What? - A man of mystery. - Well, I'm lucky then. - Oh, really? But beware. Once the mystery wears off, the misery starts. - Want another beer? - Yes. Ever had a mystery stick around? Many stick around, but few stay. I always fancy... I always fancy the wrong men. Better look out, then. You seem to me like... the right kind. Don't you have any great mysterious love affairs? I have an ex and a daughter. Then let's not talk about that, shall we? - It's been a while, hasn't it? - I'm sorry. No, it doesn't matter, it's OK. - Does that still hurt? - No. An accident on the job? - Not really, no. - No? What then? - You don't want to know. - I can handle it. But if you don't want to talk about it... What am I doing here? What am I doing here? Gosh, Rudy... - I don't know, it was fun, right? - Fun... You don't know me. No, that's true. But that may come. At least, I hope so. You hope so. What's come over you? Nothing. Sorry I asked. Please, Rudy, come to me. I gambled all my life and lost everything. Yes, but it doesn't matter, you can start... They were upstairs, asleep. I poured all the booze I had not drunk out on the floor. I sat down, threw my cigarette on the floor... and I closed my eyes. I thought that would put us out of our misery. Stupid bastard. So, that's your sweet little Rudy. Your sweet, dear Rudy. The mystery is gone. Let the misery begin. - That doesn't matter to me. - But it does to me. Rudy, it's over now. What's done is done. You're OK, your wife's OK. Your daughter's OK, right? I had two daughters. Goodbye, Chantal. Did you sleep a bit? I've taken the day off. Want to do something? I have to study. Can you drive me home? - You could work here. - No, I need my computer. Vicky, stay here. - Rest a bit. - Want me to take the bus? - I only want to know what happened. - So do I, Mom. Really, so do I. Why don't you move back here? Like in the old days: You and me. I went to see him and we had dinner together. You were right. He really is a great guy. Funny, nice body... But he no longer has a motorbike. - You don't know him. - That's right, I don't. You didn't let me see him for 7 years. - I did? - Yes, you did. How many times did he call you? Did he ever send you a letter? I'm sorry, sweetheart, but it was he who no longer wanted to see you. Nice work, Mom. Really, terrific. - What are you doing here? - If I don't hear from you... - How are you? - Terrible. Yeah, that's pretty obvious. What is it you want, David? - Vicky, I hardly see you anymore. - No. - Why is that? - I'm really not in the mood for this. Is there anything you are in the mood for, these days? Since when do I have to justify myself to you? - To me? Nothing. - Anything else? - What's wrong with you? - Nothing. - The Vicky I know... - And you know me, or what? - Come on... - What? - I thought... - What did you think? What did you think, David? I'll send you your notes by mail. - Already? What did she say? - Nothing. She wasn't there. Can't be helped. Tomorrow. Tomorrow, mate. It's useless. I've lost her. No, you haven't. I'm sure you haven't. - I'll check every day, if you want. - Idiot. - Don't do that. Don't you dare, man. - I won't. - Here. Can't study without a screen, right? - Thanks. - They've called again. - Who? Your job. Your car does not follow the fixed routes. And they send you here for that? Sitting here and looking at the apartment is not going to change much, is it? I'm not interested in that damn job at all. I'm not talking about your job. What floor does she live on? - It's pointless. - Pointless? And that's it, then? So, what are you going to do about it? - Wait. - Wait? What else can I do? Show her you are there for her, instead of sitting here like a wretch. No one ever won a war by waiting. Santa Claus has come a bit earlier this year. Do you think of her often? And of dad? I can't think of her without thinking of him. Do you have cigarettes? - What are you doing here? - It's Friday. - Yes. So what? - I've got the tickets. Are you coming? - Tickets? What for? - You know... - Are you coming? - You are unbelievable. Can I come in a second? Vicky, I know I can't ever change what happened back then. That's not possible. But I thought that maybe we could... - the two of us... - I don't think so. There are things you don't know, Vicky. There's two sides to everything. - Not now, Mom. - Come back inside. Come on. - Will you take my other daughter... - No, Mom! I am talking to my father now. Why haven't I heard from you for seven years? Why did you never answer my letters? Do you know how long I waited for an answer? She says you never wanted to see me again, is that true? Is it true? OK. That's all I needed to know. Thank you for the fond farewell. Goodbye, Rudy. Vicky is not available. Hello, it's me. How are you? Call me, will you? Rudy, you'd better come along. Where were you? I've been looking for you a long time. Me for you too... Yes, I've been away for a bit. Me too... how are you? I saw my dad. And? One big lie, just like the rest of his life. I don't think I ever want to see him again. It's better this way you don't need him. Do you really think so? I'm sure I'm going to be online less often. I want to start studying again. You'd better quit altogether. But what about you? That will pass... But I don't want to lose you. Maybe... Maybe we could meet sometime? How so? I'd like to see you. That's not a good idea. Why not? You don't know me. But I could get to know you. I'm convinced we would get along very well. And what if we don't? We will, I know it. Why? Because I have... never met someone before who understands me like you do. Do you mean that? Yes... Yes. Rachid? Are you still there?
