Really? Yeah, did you go to San Mateo high school? - Yeah, how'd you know that? - I went there too. - So are you from here? - Not really. My mother lives up here but I'm from San Francisco. What about you? San Jose. I remember you now. You were in my English class. - I was? - Yeah, I sat two seats behind you. - You remember that far? - Yeah. So what do you do? I'm a fashion model. And a beautiful one too. Thanks. Well, it was nice talking to you. But I should really get going. I've got an audition for a modeling job. So it was good talking to you. Same here. Nathalie. Oh, hi again. I was wondering if we can keep in contact. Sure. Here's my card. - Here's mine. - Thanks. Again, it was nice talking to you. - I'll see you later. - Bye. This morning flocks of seagulls and crows were found dead in downtown San Jose and along highway 101. The crows and seagulls also caused an accident on highway 101 near the 1st street exit. Authorities are investigating the cause of their death. In other news today, the population of polar bears is declining rapidly due to the melting of sea ice in the arctic. As the sea ice melts, the polar bears are forced to move farther north. Although some have survived, many have died from starvation due to the difficulty of finding enough food such as seals. What does it take to win your business today? Okay, I'll give you that and a 50% discount. Can we close the deal today? Can I place your order today? Great, thanks. We appreciate your business. Hey, what's with all the noise? Caught the big fish. Yeah? How big was the sale? $1 million. - Awesome, man. - Biggest sale of my career. I'm proud of you. Nathalie? Hey, Christine. What's up? I have great news for you. Victoria's Secret wants you to become their cover girl model. You're kidding. No no, it's the real deal. That's great. Yeah, of course I'll do it. Thanks for getting me the gig. You are welcome. You worked very hard. So here's your chance to impress them. Congratulations again. Okay, I'll talk to you soon. Okay. All right. Okay, I'll talk to you later. Thank you again. All right. Okay, bye, Christine. Thanks. Okay. - Hello? - Nathalie? Who is this? It's Rod. Oh, the guy from the restaurant. What's up? Hey, it was nice running into you at Half Moon Bay. Yeah, it was nice meeting you. So how's your day? It's going well. How's yours? Great. I made a big sale today. Good. Fantastic. Thanks. I closed a big job offer today with Victoria's secret. Wow, congratulations. I think you'll look great in those lingerie. Thanks. So how about dinner to celebrate your success? - That was fast. - I know a good vietnamese restaurant. Sounds delicious. I'll see you then. Yes. Yes. Man, all air. Whoo. This heat's killing me. I know, man. What's with this weather? A heat wave in winter? I don't know. Let's call it a day. I met this girl Nathalie over the weekend. Good for you. Is she hot? - Yeah. Fashion model. - Lucky you, man. Yeah, we're going out this weekend. Hope you score with her, man. Is that all you ever think about... is sex? Anyways, we're just gonna go to lunch. Just talk. Get to know each other. A day without sex is a day wasted, man. I'll let you know how it goes. Anyways, I heard N.C.T. is going to be acquired by Oracle. - Really? I hope that's true, man. - I know it's true. You know, if that happens, we'll all be millionaires. Yeah. There was a wildfire today in the Santa Cruz mountains. Dubbed the St. Martin wildfire, it has already burned through 30,000 acres of trees and has destroyed over 100 homes. Currently there is 0% containment of this fire. However, firefighters are hopeful that within the coming days the weather will become more favorable and help to extinguish the St. Martin wildfire. In other news, the first Green Grand Prix event was announced today in San Francisco. All cars for this racing event will be powered with hybrid or electric technologies. Parts of the streets of San Francisco will be used as the racing course and the drivers will be Hollywood celebrities. Hi, my name is Jerry Owens. I'm from solar power accessories. We have an appointment today. Oh, yeah yeah. Come on in. Here's that estimate I was telling you about. Wow, $20,000 for a 3 kilowatt solar panel? Yes. Where are you gonna put it? Come and I'll show you. And that, sir, is where we're going to install your solar panel. Okay. $20,000, huh? Is there any way we can lower the price? For you, sir, I'll knock off $1,000. - $1,000, huh? - Yeah. - Okay, let's do it. - All right. Hi, Nathalie. Hi. Hi. This is for you. Thanks. That's sweet. - You ready? - Yeah. So why did you decide to go into sales? I like sales. It fits my personality. I started out as a software engineer, a b.s. in computer science. Software development was boring for me. And I felt I was more of a sales and marketing type. So I switched to a high-tech sales career. That's interesting. Some of my friends say that my b.s. Degree stands for bullshit because I was too much of a salesman and not enough engineer. Very funny. I work at a start-up company called N.C.T. Software. Got the stock option. Hopefully if the company makes it big by being bought out or goes public, I'll exercise that stock option, cash out and walk away with tons of cash. My silicon valley dream. I hope that happens for you. Thanks. Tell me about modeling. What do you like about it? I love it. It's fun and glamorous. But hard work. My mother doesn't see that though. She wants me to be a real estate agent. It's not for me though. Do what you like, Nathalie. Follow your dream. I have every intention. So how come you never made a pass at me in school? I should have. I was too shy. Why don't you make a pass at me now? I thought I already had. So what's your plan? Family? Kids? Whoa, now this is getting serious. I'm just curious. I'd probably settle down if I met the right lady. - Hope you do. - So do i. So who's the right lady? She's beautiful, kind, compassionate, honest and loyal. - Is that all? - Yup. How about a nice figure? Sexy? That would certainly help. What do you like to do for fun? Watch football, especially the 49ers. Also a part-time eagles fan. And a little exercise... Tennis. How about you? I like to go to the movies. And I like to hang around with my best friends and go dancing at the clubs... Clubbing. And I like to spend time with Alex. Alex? He's really cute. Who is Alex? And I love him to death. Come on, let me see the picture. Is he your boyfriend? I can't wait for you to meet him. Come on, let me see it. Come on, let me see it. All right. Meet Alex. You're right. He is cute. - So you're a cats lover. - Yes. If I could afford it, I'd have at least 10 of them. - Wow, a cat zoo? - Yup. You've got to be kidding. Nope. Beautiful, kind, compassionate and intelligent. - I hope you find her. - I will. - That was fun. - We should do it again. I'd like to. Good night. See you next week. Can't I come in? Not on the first date. I'm not that kind of girl. Okay. Good night. - Hi, mom. - Oh hi, honey. - How are you? - Oh, good. I'm just fixing some lunch. You want to stay? I've actually got to run soon. But I needed to pop in and see you. I'm glad you did. What's that smile all about? I don't know what you're talking about, mom. Oh, come on. I see it all over your face. Well, I did meet a guy. You're kidding. He is great, mom. You know we went to the same high school? - Is that right? - Yeah. We had lunch over the weekend and it was terrific, mom. I mean, we hit it off right away. He's smart and he's ambitious. And he's interested in what I have to say Instead of trying to get something from me. So he's great. Oh, that's fantastic. Now what does he do for a living? He's a software salesman. Oh listen, invite him over for dinner. I'd love to meet him. Maybe in time, mom, when we get better acquainted. Well, I can understand that. You know, look, keep me... You know, keep me informed along the way. - All right. - How's modeling going? It's great, mom. I got a job with Victoria's secret. - No way! - Yeah. Are you serious? Oh my gosh. Oh, honey, you know I've always been supportive of your modeling career. It's just such a tough business to be in. It is. Thank you, mom. I'm well on my way. Well, listen. If things don't work out, it doesn't hurt to have a secure financial husband to support you. Or, you know, a real estate career to fall back on. Okay, mom. Thanks. You told me about a dozen times already. You know I always love your advice. Actually, I've got to get going. I just wanted to drop by and say hi to you and to tell you all about my new gig. Well, does the gig pay well? - Yes, it does. - Ooh, that's my girl. I need to get the phone. Hello? Hey, Mai. Yeah? It's Nathalie. Oh, hi. What are you doing? What does it sound like I'm doing? Rick is here in bed with me. Sorry to interrupt. Listen, do you want to go on a double date with me? I don't know. Why? I just met this guy Rod and he's terrific. Sounds fun. I'll let Rick know. Great. I'll set it up. Want to go on a double date with me? Why not? My friend Nathalie just met someone named Rod. You remember, the fashion model? Oh yeah. With Rod? My buddy Rod. He was telling me last week he met a fashion model named Nathalie. - Oh really? - Yeah. Man, this is gonna be fun. Ladies and gentlemen. Please help me give a warm welcome for our c.E.O. Bill Star. Thank you. Good morning. Ladies and gentlemen, I have some great news. Our board of directors has agreed to the acquisition of N.C.T. Software by oracle corporation For $1 billion. A billion. A billion. You guys... You guys have worked hard and you've all earned your stock option. Congratulations. You you you you and you. So I guess the meeting's adjourned. Congratulations. Good work. You bet. You bet. - Congratulations. - Way to go, Bill. The negotiating man. Oh yeah! - Thank you so much. - What are you getting with your money? So now you've got a big payday with your big stock option, huh? Yeah, I earned it. All those big deals I did with N.C.T. and millions of dollars in revenue and sales. Well, you've done a great job, Rod. And we appreciate your contribution. Thank you. Thank you. You like it? I'm gonna get the real Ferrari Spider F430 soon. So what are you gonna do with your newfound wealth? I think I'm going on break. Early retirement. No car? Well, with that new fashion model chick you might want to impress her with a Ferrari. I don't think she's materialistic. When are you gonna grow up, man? Chicks love cars. If you want to get into their pants, you'd better have a nice hot Ferrari. She's my hot Ferrari. Besides, I love my mustang, which is a plug-in hybrid. It gets 100mpg. Anyways, I'm thinking about opening up a green tech company. Really? Oh, by the way, I know your girlfriend Nathalie. She's my girlfriend's best friend. - Huh, small world. - Yeah. And they're planning on setting us up for a double date. - It's gonna be fun. - Yeah. Man, that was a good movie... "an inconvenient truth." That is it. I'm getting myself a car that's environmentally friendly. - Yeah. - Good, you're finally listening to me. That's right. Hey, Mai and I got to get back to work. So, uh... Just trot off. Work? Yeah, you know, sensual work. Oh, I see. Understood. Well, you guys have a good time. Yeah, all right. With Mass Solar's nano-based solar panels, they cost the manufacturer for one watt of electricity 10 cent. That's a fraction of the cost of a recurring silicon-based solar panel which is $4 per watt. So a 3-kilowatt Mass Solar nano-based solar-powered system would probably cost around $300-$500. At this price everyone can afford solar power for their home or businesses. With these panels, solar power will be available and affordable for everyone. No need for leasing or financing an expensive $20,000 silicon-based solar panel. Is there a patent? Yes, Mass Solar owns the patent to this technology. Good. Who are your competitors? Companies like Sun Power, Silicon Valley Solar. But these companies' solar panels are based on silicon technology, which is very expensive to manufacture. That's why it's for $4 per watt. On the other hand, Mass Solar's manufacturing process is simple, it's low cost and it uses nanotechnology. That's why we're able to deliver 10 per watt. So how much funding are you requesting? $10 million. Guys, this is revolutionary green tech. Contingent upon agreement on our terms sheets, - we're going to fund you. - Awesome. - Oh, lovers on the moon. - Yeah. Oh, look how cute. The sea is so beautiful. Yes, it is. You know, all life came from the sea. I mean, look at us. We're made of water. So... So what is your ideal man? Well, for one thing, he has to have a lot of stock options invested. At least you're honest. He has to be kind, honest. Successful, ambitious, and opportunistic. - Is that all? - Yup. So do you have, like, a backup plan, You know, if your modeling career doesn't work out? Not really. I figure if I don't make it big by the time I'm 30, I figure I'll just take it from there. You should have a plan b now. I always do. I mean, look at me. I started out as a software engineer and ended up a salesman. You sound like my mother. Good advice though. Who knows? Maybe I will consider a career in real estate, or even becoming a wife of a successful entrepreneur. Look at these birds. Stop, don't touch it. It may be infectious. - Oh hi. - Hi, mom. - How are you? - Good good. - This is Rod. - Hi, Rod. - So nice to meet you. - Likewise. Come on in, you guys. Good to see you, honey. Come on in. Rod, Nat tells me that you are a very successful salesman. She did, huh? I am very passionate about my career. So Nathalie tells me you recently retired. Yes, I did. And she mentioned that you were gonna take an early retirement. Yeah, a few months. Just taking a little break. So are you enjoying your retirement? I love the retirement. I was a jeweler for 30 years. And sometimes I miss not going into the jewelry store. But, you know, I really like retirement. I like to travel. I like to cruise. And I enjoy watching television. And my biggest thing is I love to watch Nat and work with her in her modeling career. Wow, Nathalie's a lucky person to have such a loving mother. Oh, thanks, Rod. I appreciate that. My big thing is to make sure that she's happy and successful in whatever she chooses to do. Thanks, mom. Hello. Here's your drinks. - Thanks. - Thank you. Can I get you anything else? We're still looking at the menu. Thank you. - Hope you enjoy. - Thanks. I really enjoyed meeting your mother. She seemed to really like you. I was so lonely until now. So do you think I'm that right lady? Maybe. Do you think I'm the ideal man? Perhaps. You know, Rod, I was just kidding about the stock options, shopping and money and all that. All I want is you. Are you sure? Definitely. Guys are usually just into me for my looks and sex. But you're not like that. You're a real gentleman. I feel like you really respect me. That means a lot to me. I feel like I could be with you for a long time. Then I'm one lucky man. I think my luck has changed since I met you. Really? Why's that? Last week the company N.C.T. Software that I work for was bought for $1 billion by Oracle corporation. And this week my start-up company that I founded, Mass Solar, got funded $10 million by Evergreen Capital. Wow. You said that might happen. Congratulations. Thanks. that's a long time Don't you owe me some money? I think somebody's calling me, I've got to go... just hanging out, hanging out hanging out with my family having ourselves a party just hanging out, hanging out hanging out with my family having ourselves a party a cool summer breeze making me feel at ease the barbecue is broiling and Uncle Phil is scoring big mama's in the kitchen and everybody's wishing that she's fixing they're favorite dish just hanging out, hanging out hanging out with my family having ourselves a party just hanging out, hanging out hanging out with my family having ourselves a party just hanging out, hanging out just hanging out hanging out with my family having ourselves a party we're just hanging out, hanging out hanging out with my family having ourselves a party young ladies are doing their makeup and the brothers can't wait to hook up Jill Scott is on the radio and I hear somebody say hello so Thelma starts to dancing and grandma starts to prancing to make sure that the fellas don't try any glancing just hanging out, hanging out hanging out with my family having ourselves a party just hanging out, hanging out... You are forever beautiful. Thank you. So? What do you think? You look divine. Rod. What is it? I think they're eagles. What in the world? Battery is dead. What's going on? Can they get in? Not for the moment. Rod, they're breaking in through the window. Hurry, let's barricade it with the bed. Hurry! That should hold 'em. I think they're gone. Well, do you know why they stopped? I don't know. Maybe they got tired. Why would birds do something like that? I mean, why would they just attack? I don't know. Anybody in here? Come on. - Name's Rod. - Ramsey. - This is Nathalie. - Nice to meet you. - My girlfriend Becky. - Hi. - You guys okay? - Yeah, we're all right. - I guess. - Man, those birds were attacking all night. Then they just suddenly stopped. We'd try to drive away but I can't find my car keys. - I lost them somewhere. - They were attacking us too. We have a van outside. - You guys are more than welcome to come. - Yeah, come with us. Thank you. We need something to protect ourselves. Use these. Here you go. All right. Let's all get our backs to each other. That we can see the birds coming from every direction. - Okay. - Just like this. All right, ready? - Let's go. - Let's go. Here they come! Open the door. The door is stuck. The door's stuck. Hurry up. I can't hurry up. Damn birds scratched me. Becky, hand me a gun. Rod, drive. Here, Rod. Take a pistol. Let's go. Hey, there's dead people on the side of the road. Let's go see if there's any survivors. Okay. Becky, cover us. I'll check out this car, you check out the other. Okay. They're dead. Come on, honey. Come over here. Come out from under the car. Come on. No, I don't want to come out. The birds will bite me. No they won't. Come on. I'll protect you, I promise. I'm scared. They killed my mommy. They killed my mommy. It's the birds! Help. Help! Let me out! - Help! - Run for it. Let's go. Help! Come on, let's go. Come on. Come on! - Let's go. - Come on. What's your name, sweetie? Susan. We're gonna make this feel all better. Thank you. Thanks. Thank you. - Oh, you want to play? - Okay. I'm hungry. I've been under the car for a long time. Yeah, me too. I'm starving. Hey, the kids are getting hungry. We should stop and get some food for them. And some for us too. There's a convenience store close by. We'll stop there. Becky, watch Tony while he sleeps, okay? I'll stand guard. You go get food and water. Okay. You want to get some candy? Okay. - Get some for Tony too. - Okay. Let's go, guys. The eagles are coming. Come on, guys. Let's go. The eagles are attacking. Come on, let's go. Hey, look. There's an old guy on the bridge. Hey, mister. What the hell are you doing out here? Hey hey! Stand back! These birds are contagious. Now go away. Hey, I thought I told you to stand back. These birds are contaminated. They have bird flu virus. Now go away. Could we just talk about it at the picnic area? You want to talk? Okay. All right. We'll talk. Guys, this is Dr. Jones. How do you do? - Hi. - Hi. Sir, don't you know that these birds are attacking people? - These birds? - Yes. No way. They're dead from the bird flu virus. - Bird flu virus? - How do you know this? I just tested their blood. Then why are they attacking us? I don't know. But what I do know is global warming is causing viral diseases such as bird flu, west nile virus and SARS. So what are you saying? That global warming is causing these birds to attack? No. I'm a scientist... An ornithologist. I can't state any scientific fact without evidence. But there is scientific evidence to show that because of our burning of fossil fuels and creating greenhouse gasses which is causing global warming, It's raising the temperature of the seas and species like the krill are dying. So many bird species can't find food like the neritic krill. They eventually starve and die, wash up on the shore. There's also evidence that global warming is interrupting the birth, mating and migration cycles of many species. In fact, in the last few years 40 species have become extinct because of global warming. However, there is interesting research that in prehistoric times birds did attack cavemen. They used to claw at their eyes and skull. They'd either leave them for dead or then come back because their injuries were so bad and finally finish off the kill. If they attack me, I've got a little present for them. Well, you certainly know a lot about birds. Well, I should. I'm an ornithologist. I study and work with birds for a living. You should come with us. It's safer. I don't need protection. I can take care of myself. I've got my truck and my trailer. Besides, I'm not worried about the blackbirds. They're not the dangerous animal. It's the human species that's the dangerous and menacing and terrifying animal. Because of his fossil fuel related activities, he's causing global warming. It's killing life and earth itself. It's the human species that needs to quit playing cowboy with nature. We must act more like astronauts, Spacemen taking care of our spaceship earth. Well, nice meeting you. Good luck. Where's Becky? She's taking a shit. Nathalie's watching her back. You're pretty good at shooting. How come you're still not in the marines? I just got tired of all the fucking killing in Iraq. Why can't we just give peace a chance? Right there. - I'll cover you. - Okay. Oh my God, she's dead. Rod! Rod! Ramsey! She's dead. I couldn't do anything. She's dead. What do you mean she's dead? Let's go! Come on, let's go! The eagles killed Becky. Fucking killed Becky. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Ramsey. They got to her before I got a chance. I don't know what to do. Hey, those people on that bus are being attacked by those birds. - Let's go save them. - We can't. We have no room. - It's full in here. - They killed Becky. What if it was Nathalie? Please help me! Help! Come on. I've got to get out of here. Come on, guys, let's go. The birds are gone. No they're not. They're not gone. They're gonna kill us if we go out there. Come on, let's go. I don't want to. They'll kill us. Rod, I'm gonna go get those people. - Cover me, okay? - Okay. - Come on, let's go. - No. - Come on. Let's go. - No. - Come on. - No. Let's go. Help me! No! I don't want to go! - Come on. - No, no! - I don't want to go! - Let's go. - No! - Don't make me go out there! Follow me. I'm going out there to save them. Don't go. If you go out there you'll die. They're dead already. Yeah, you're right. Let's get the hell out of here. Hi. The eagles killed our friends. Do you have a phone I can use to call the police? No, I'm sorry. All phones from the eagle attack... All phones are dead up here. Really? Damn it. Well, we need some gas. Well, you know, from the eagle attack we are short on gas. But it's $100 a gallon if you want. What? $100? That's outrageous. Well, either you take it or leave it. I have only a few gallons left only. It's a rip-off. Fine. Thank you. Tony, Susan, can you guys go get some water over there? Then you can go get candy for yourselves. - Yay. - Okay. Hey, look at that man up there. We should stop and help him. Okay. - Howdy. - Hi. Can you sell me some gas for my truck? We only have a few gallons and we need them. We just bought some for $100 a gallon down the street. $100 a gallon? I've only got 50 in my wallet. - We can give you a ride. - Oh, no thanks. Sorry, but we need it. - You're gonna sell me some gas now. - Whoa, take it easy. Take it easy. I've got an extra tank in the back. Good. Get it. Rod, let's get out of here. There's a creek over there. We can get some fresh water. Okay. Who's there? Who's there? Come out or I'll shoot. Don't shoot. Peace, man. Come down here. Why were you hiding in the trees? This is my home. I live here. That's my house. You live in a tree? Sure do. So you're a tree hugger? You could put it that way. I love trees. They're my family. I look out for them and protect these precious redwoods. So can we play in your tree house? Sure. Yes, that'll be fun! No way, it's too dangerous. The eagles might come there. Oh, they won't. You're very safe here in the forest. Haven't you noticed those eagles seem to be going after people in their cars and gas stations? Besides, it's not the eagles I worry about. It's the dry drought weather that's killing these trees. There's not enough rain and water. Even worse, the spruce bark beetles are eating These trees to death and turning them from green to red. I remember when those beetles used to die out during the winter. But now with the dry climate they've multiplied and taken over the forest. Take a look at that dead redwood up there. That was killed by a bark beetle. This damn global warming. It's the cause of dry climate and bark beetles and death of the trees and forest. I can protect these trees against greedy lumber companies and bad campers who start forest wildfires. But it's impossible to protect them against global warming. - What's your name? - I'm Tom Hill. I'm Rod. This is Nathalie, Susan and Tony. You can come with us. Oh, I can't. This is my home. I have to stay here to protect these trees from further harm. Enjoy and appreciate these trees while you can. In a few years they'll be gone. I hear a mountain lion. I've got to get back to my house. You'd better get to your car. It was very nice meeting you. You too. I think it's this way to the van. - No, it's this way. - Are you sure? What's that smell? Smells like wood burning. It's a forest fire. Let's go, come on. This way. You see that lighthouse over there? That's where Mai lives. We should stop by and see if she's there. Okay. - Oh my God. - What? That's Mai's car. - We should pull over. - Okay. Oh God, Mai. Mai, are you okay? Mai. Nat? Mai. Forgive them... Mai. Mai? Mai! God. Mai. Damn it! We ran out of gas. What are we gonna do? If we're lucky someone might drive by. - I'm hungry. - Me too, I'm hungry. We've got to find a way to get them some food. - What should we do? - I don't know. Hey look, a fishing rod. I can go catch some fish. Oh look, a stove. We can cook it. Hey, good idea. Hey, Nat. I'll go fishing over there. How about you and the kids go get some seaweed? Okay. You guys eat seaweed? Seaweed's the best. It's good for your health. Is that right? I caught a fish! - He caught a fish. - Yay! Awesome. I got a fish. Looks good. I got some seaweed. Good. I'm gonna go up to the van and get the stove So we can cook this. Here you go. This'll be good for us. Yuck. I want a happy meal. Me too. You know, you guys. There's no happy meals around here. Just try the seaweed. It'll be really good. - No. - No, I want a happy meal. I don't know. Guys. Guys, get up. The eagles. The eagles. Come on, we've got to go. Damn, I'm out of bullets. Nat, you hit them if they get through windshield, okay? Look! They're leaving. I wonder why they stopped the attack.
