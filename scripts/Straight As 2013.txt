The grand casino. It's going to be perfect. (little boy) if you Wikipedia death, it says it is the permanent termination of all biological functions that sustain living organisms. What it doesn't tell you is how to cope with death. You have to let go, Gracie. It's the only way to say goodbye. When we lost Samson, Gracie and I were the saddest we've ever been. (Gracie) Bye, Samson. My Mom says that life changing e vents, no matter how big or small, happen in threes. I must get back to work, okay? Come. Wait. Did you sign it? Oh, no. Samson was the first. [horse neighs] And then, he arrived. Look! A horse? The third would happen within four days, and show us that life really comes full circle. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Can I help you? Yeah, this the Henderson house? Si. I'm your Uncle Scott. Your daddy's brother. He never mentioned me? You must be Todd. No, Charles. Shit. Caroline. My name is Gracie Ann, and I'm 6 and 3/4s. Well, Gracie Ann, I'm 31 years old. Excuse me, sir, but Mr. Henderson is not here right now. Where did he go? He's out of town for work. Ah. (Gracie) Can I pet your horse ? You sure can. My horse's name is Moose. Moosey. You can pat him. That's him saying hi. (Gracie) He's so nice. Yeah, he's a good one. I like him. Me, too. Why do you ride a horse? Well, Charles I got a DUI- They took my license. Ain't that a bitch ? So, what happened here? (Gracie) Samson passed away. Oh, I'm sorry. That really sucks. How did it happen? I'm in the middle of an investigation. Could be foul play. You mean murder? Possibly. Samson have many enemies? I haven't ruled anyone out yet, but there is one person I'm focusing on. Oh, who's that? [woman ta/king] If I wanted carnations, don't you think I would've ordered them? I asked for the great rose. I asked for them. I did ask for them Mom hates frogs. Did you say a frog? Wait, Samson was a frog? He was an oriental fire belly toad. You got a fucking love frog. Shh. He was a nice king frog. He never got to be a prince. At least I got a chance to know him. I think that's about the nicest eulogy I ever heard. I should be so lucky when I go. What's a eulogy? It's what you say at a funeral. Yes, your psalm. Your psalm? Like your net worth. That grand total of your entire life in three lines. (Mum) All right, you guys, enough of this nonsense. What the hell is that? [horse whinnies] Who are you? Excuse me. Check this out. Hey, sister. How the hell are you? [gasps] [glass breaks] Nice house. Why are you here? You need money? Mom told me you all needed my help. So, here I am. Your mother? When? Couple of days ago. Couple of days ago ? Where ? Coffee shop. Nana? Yeah, Nana. I refer to her as Mom but-- Scott, are you okay? Nana's dead. Yes, I know. That's what makes it so wild. I'm sitting there at Jake's a couple of days ago having a coffee and a smoke when, I don't know where, Mom's sitting next to me. I swear to God. I just' smoked a little that morning, so I thought it was me being high, but buzz wore off, she stuck round. She told me some stuff. One thing leads to another, and here I am. How come we've never met you? I've been-- Been traveling. Traveling ? Where ? Honduras ? I ain't never made it to Honduras. Truth calls for some whiskey. [whispers] Shit. Charles, I've spent the better part of the last eight years in and out of hospitals. Are you a doctor? Thank you, Charles. No. Are you sick? You could say that. Testicular cancer? That's what Lance Armstrong suffered from. [laughs] Do you like Lance Armstrong? No. No to a testicular cancer or no to liking Lance Armstrong ? Both. So, why were you in the hospital? Your uncle here is--- Was a little crazy and a kind of a drug addict. Gracie. What? It's all right. It's just funny. Who doesn't think a crazy person's fun? Point is, I'm better now. Is that why you had coffee a couple of days ago with your dead mother? (Charles) For the last eight years you've been in a mental institution ? In and out. Also spent quite a bit of time in a rehab facility for drug and alcohol dependency. It ain't tight. You know, guys, go upstairs, please. Louisa! What? Please, take the children upstairs. [Gracie speaking in Spanish] In English in the house when Mommy's around, please- Why are you here ? Fuck me. Why are you here? We moved here to be closer to your dad after your mom died. He has-- Alzheimers, so he says. Hey, hey, how did you know that? Mom told me. There's no smoking in the house. Come on. You know, Cathy, I never figured you for living in a house like this. Things change. People change. Did you hear me? There's no smoking in the house. All right. You know what? Mom's right. Is that how you should have been at her funeral? No, about Charles. Really? What did she say? Is he gay? What? I don't know why she said he's gay, but he is a little strange. It's a Vicodin. You want one? No, I don't want a Vicodin. Doctor's orders. Where's Willy? He'd deck you if he heard you call him that. Shreveport, I think, till Thursday. Today's Sunday? Today's Tuesday. So, I lost a couple of days somewhere. I take it there isn't a job you have to be at during the week? What's your job ? All right. I really want to see my brother, so I'm thinking maybe I'll just hang here until he gets back. It is great to see you, Cathy. You still look pretty hot- [buzzing] (man) Now, you were killing it out there today. Big dog, teach in a clinic. You all right? Yeah. We've just got to convince the broker to give us a few more days on the option. It should happen. Yeah. that's not what I'm talking about. Hey, what's up? I, uh, when I get back to Dallas, I'm going to leave my wife. Hi, what's happening? Hey, Charles, that Xbox work out there? I already beat all the games. Oh, yeah ? What are you working on? An oral report for class. I'll tell you what. You hit them books, and after dinner you and I'll get our game on. Deal? Oh, man. How come you call her that? How come I called who what? Mommy "sister." I don't know. I guess I made it up after she married your daddy. Technically Katherine 's not your sister. She's your sister-in-law. Hm. How come she doesn't like you? You don't think she likes me? She's pretty mean to you. Yeah, that's just 'cause we go way back. I bet you guys didn't know that your mommy and I were high school sweethearts. [giggles] Did you and mommy kiss? Of course we kissed. Lovers, we did everything. I-- Is that why you went to the rehab? Probably. [knocking] Yeah? Dinner's almost ready. All right, homie. You can sit by me. Awesome. We'll give him five more minutes. Kids, I don't want you to get too attached to your uncle. He's got a lot of problems. Maybe we can help him. I think he's funny. Where does he live? I don't know. Is he married? I doubt it. Does he have any kids? Oh, God, I hope not. Where does he work ? I'm sure he doesn't. Where does he get money? That's probably why he's here. How come he gets to have a horse? Why were you lovers? Eat. [blues music] [knocking] (Charles) Uncle Scott? Uncle Scott? I'm fucking starving. Why do you have a horse? This guy of Memphis owed me some money. I took the horse instead. Worked out well, 'cause I got a couple of DUIs, and I can't operate anything with a key. Good thing we lock our doors. Where is everybody? In bed. That's the plate Charles' made for you, and exquisite is the dinner he refused to eat 'cause he was waiting for his Uncle Scott. Shit. I got in the fucking tub, and the next thing you know-- I think it's time for you to leave. I missed dinner. Big fucking deal. I mean, I didn't know there were rules. Oh, there are rules. You can come back on Thursday when William returns. I said I'm sorry. It won't happen again. I'm not the one you need to apologize to. I don't know about that. I'm sure I owe you a couple from somewhere. We haven't seen or heard from you since you made that scene at the wedding. You show up, you call me a bad mother. My son a homosexual, or at the very least strange, and your horse is ruining my fucking flowers. Wait a minute. First of all, I never called you a bad mother. Ana' I'm sorry about the wedding. I probably shouldn't have been there, but you all probably shouldn't have invited me. You were the best man. Was I? Did you smoke this part of the story? You left me. I left Texas, not you. You were the one who chose to stay. I sent you a ticket. You've hurt everyone who's ever cared about you, and I can't let you do the same thing to my children. I will make it up to Charles. I promise you. (woman) Scott? Mom? Now, you really think that's a good idea? [whispering] You promised I'm just  A rambling man  I roam from .0 Town to town .0 [Too Young continues] [Gracie chanting] Morning, morning, morning. (Katherine) Gracie, shh. Mama's on the phone. Good morning, Uncle Scott. Yeah. You missed spaghetti. I fell asleep in the tub. It's dangerous. I wear floaties in the tub. Morning, sis. Morning, bro. What up, Charlie? Dude, I rode about 400 miles on a horse yesterday. I was dead tired. I'm sorry. I was really looking forward to our first family meal with you all, and playing games. He fell asleep in the tub. Yeah. I believe it's time for schoo,. You ready, Louisa? All right, great. Just fucking ignore me. Kids! Louisa! They left already. Oh. Okay, well, I'm running late, so. Louisa will be back. Just don '2' touch anything. Hey, what did Willie say? No smoking in the house, including marijuana, no Vicodin. No drugs in my house. Yes, ma'am. [Joe Purdy singing Big Top] The center of the table, please. [music continues] Oh, shit! What are you doing? What's your favorite cartwheel? I don't really have one. Well, do you like grapefruit juice? Yeah. I really screwed up with Charles, didn't I? Do you think he'll forgive me? It's your time. Okay. (woman) Gentlemen, it's a pleasure. I'm lead counsel for the private interest who controls the /ease on the riverfront property. Dana! Billy? Yeah. Hey. How are you doing? Great. Great to see you. You, too. I didn't know you were on this project. Yeah. Thank you, Miss Earling. That was quite exceptional. Next up, Mr. Henderson on the subject of the Aztecs. You ready? Yes, sir. Well then, let's hear if. [laughter] Quiet, people! Go ahead, Charles. [school bell rings] Those of you who didn't get to speak today, will be unrehearsed for Friday. I hope you are prepared. I like butterflies, and I like bees, and I like, of course I like pets. Gracie, hold on. I like guinea pigs and I like birds, and I like bears. How about a hairdo? Uh, not too tight. So, you've done this before, Gracie. Right? Never. Not even on my dolls. What kind of haircut do you want? Do you want it casual? Do you want it fancy? Oh, man. This perfume's really-- it's hard on the eyes. Now what happens? Ow! Sorry. Do you see any blood back there? No, you're fine. I'll show you. Come here. [humming] No laughing. So, how am I looking? Ready for school. Unbelievable. I can't say that I'm surprised. That is who she is. Ever since Josh got his inheritance, she is a different person. Hi, everyone. Oh, Katherine, what a great event. Oh, I've booked our tickets for the 4th of July. So excited. I've rented this most amazing house in Seaside. I'm surprising William and the kids. I mean, you all should come. That sounds wonderful. I'll see you in a bit. See you later. What is going on? Sue said, Elena said, Angie said some man came out of your house this morning, and asked her son for a cigarette. Are you having an affair? It's okay if you are, but why are we the last to know? No, no, it's William's brother. [gasps] You're having an affair with Scott? No, he's here to see William. William is never-- [clears throat] He's not home. Cool if I sit down? What are you doing here? You're going to get me in trouble. All right. Well, how about this, if I hide? Who's that? Amanda Hyde. Why? I think she's into you. Question is, are you into her? Hey, it's totally okay if you're not. I am, but I think you're crazy. She hates me. They all make fun of me. That's fucked up. Okay, how about this? I'll go over there, and get Miss Hyde to come and say hello. Then you and I are square. Deal? Do-don't. That's some good ass juice. You can't get juice like that on the outside. I'm just screwing with you. You can get juice on the outside. Not that I've ever been inside of prison. I've been in jail. Don't freak out, dude. I got his-- I got everybody in line. And this one's for you, darling. See that little girl at the end of the line with the pink ribbon and pony tail? You get her whatever she wants Tell her it's on Charles Henderson, and you keep the change. How are you related to my dad? Thank you. Oh, boy, here comes Dr. Carr. He hates me. Why? Because I cracked at him once. Hi, what's up? What is your name? Scott Henderson. Charles, do you know this man? He's my uncle. And you two beautiful ladies are-- Miss Carol. Nice to meet you. And this is Miss Dougan. Join us! Juice? Excuse me, but you have to have a visitor's badge in order to eat lunch with a student. I do. And where is your visitor's badge? I lost it. Where did you lose it? Don't know. If I did, it wouldn't be classified as lost. Who did you check in with? All right, boss, you got me. I didn't check in. I'm just here to have lunch with my nephew. It's no big deal. Y'all feel free to join us. Shit, we got juice for fucking days. You will not use profanity toward an educator, especially in front of his student. I didn't. What did I say? You know what you said, sir. Okay, that's it. Both of you, let's go now! Now, hold up, hold on. Your problem's with me, not him. I'm leaving. All right. Miss Dougan and Miss Carol. Later, Charles. (Amanda) Thank you, Charles From a very nice Cohiba, and he says, "Son, I won't smoke a cigar if it's smaller than my penis." I'll drink to that. Come on. I never had a chance to talk to you about that Carlton deal. The architecture from that deal was flawless. You drove up the offer against the Dow. Five weekends in a row. Yeah. I didn't think anybody noticed that. I've used it on two deals since. No kidding? Wow. You two work together in Dallas? Yeah. Thanks for the lift, compadre. Do you mind making another stop? Si, cmo no. You've ever met my old man? What are you, a migrant? All right. It's up here on the left. Hey... Who are you? Dad, it's Scott. Now, look here, mister. I don't know who you're looking for, but I can assure you it's not me. Sometimes I-I like to talk to strangers. Sometimes I don't. I know you're faking this sickness. You need to get off my property. Mom told me she wants us to talk, so-- You know what? You are still a fucking asshole. I tried. Hey, I ain't going to tell you again. Are you kidding me? Mr. Henderson. I'm leaving. I'm leaving. Go. Calm down. Why do these people always coming round my house? Come on in the house. Come on now. I go! you a big bowl of chili. Do you want some chili? (Gracie) Hi, Uncle Scott. Uncle Scott. Louisa and I are cooking eggplant tonight. Want to help? I ain't feeling so hot, pretty girl. Mrs. Henderson, this is Mr. Dewitt, Charles ' Principal. It seems we had an incidence today. A man claiming to be Charles' uncle broke into the cafeteria, shouted profanity at a teacher, made a pass at one of our aides, smoked cigarettes. The list goes on. [knocking] Shit. Come in. Amanda thanked me for the juice box. That was awesome. Yeah, it kind of was. Listen, homie, I'm tired. I have to give an oral report on the Aztecs on Friday in front of the whole school. Sweet. What's the problem? If I get a bad grade, it'll ruin my average. They give grades at your age? They do in fourth grade. I thought you were six. I'm eight. I skipped second grade, and I want to make straight A's. Dude, there's a lot more to life than just straight A 's- [clears th roat] All right, so what's your problem? You're a smart kid, man. I'm not very proficient at oral reports. Public speaking should be easy for you. Why? Because you're not intimidated by shit. How do you know that I'm not intimidated? Dude, look at you. The shirt, the lie, the goddamn briefcase. All them things ain't nothing more than FU's to everybody. Yeah? Shit, yeah. Okay, here we go. A key to public speaking. You find one face in the crowd that you trust, okay? You focus on that face, concentrate on it. Ignore everything else. And once you're comfortable with that person, you start adding another, another, one by one. Before you know it, you're good. Uncle Scott, will you come to the assembly? I don't think that's such a good idea. Please, just this one time. I'll even get you a visitor's pass. Shit, it's hard for me to commit to things. All right. I'll be there. Katherine eluded to the fact they're unreliable. So you have to promise. I promise. What a day. I can't believe we're still not closed. Oh, we're this close to closing. Then you get to head home after all this? I wish. New York on Monday. New Jersey on Saturday, and home to Chicago on Thursday. That's quite a schedule. Wow. Want to grab a drink? Sure, sounds good. Okay, so you're marrying Katie Couric. Yes. I'm Bill Couric. How are you doing? [laughing] That's a no brainer. So, Ellen or Martha? Hold on. If you go with Ellen, you get a little portion? No, it's only Ellen. Now, what about Martha? Is this a one-night stand or a long-term affair? Three times a week. Okay. I'm banging Ellen. Final decision. So, you're going to kill Martha Stewart. By default, even though I don't want to 'cause she's the one who has the best taste out of all these women. It's like killing Christmas. Yeah. You imagine the Christmas you'd have with Martha Stewart? Beautiful. My God. It would be like being on the North Pole. Okay, you gotta play. You got Rob Blagojevich, okay? Disgraced governor of Illinois. Then you got Anthony Weiner, disgraced congressman. And then you got Skipper Spitzer. How about a little Elliot Spitzer? Disgraced governor. Three guys on the ropes. What do you do? Did you go to Charles' school today? Somebody missed dinner. Did you? What did you hear? That you broke into the school and started a fight with one of the teachers? That's ridiculous. That's not at all how-- I'm not interested in your version of the story. I'll leave you alone for not even half a day. Well, full day. What part of "there are rules" do you not understand? Like the one that forbids absentee white trash uncles from trespassing on school property, cursing in the cafeteria and humiliating me! Wow. Just so you know? You're kind of being a cunt. Dana Spencer. No, no. You're flirting with our deal. I'm not flirting with our deal. Dana just happens to be an old colleague, that's all. What's going on with you and Katherine? Things just haven't been very good for awhile. Well, well. What's Katherine say? I don't even-- I don't even think think she knows. You know she was my brother's first girlfriend? Yeah, that's how we met. [laughs] Yeah. My brother, [clears throat] He and my dad had a big blowout. My brother left town. Just kind of disappeared. Didn't come back. She was devastated, you know? And, uh, it just happened. Next thing you know, she'd gotten pregnant. We got married. You know. She was just a kid. Oh, shot gun wedding. No, no, not at all. It was the real deal. She-- Yeah. She was really what I wanted. But I don't know what's happened now, you know. I've spent the better part of the year trying to figure it out. I just -- We just stopped being us. This is William. Can '1 come lo the phone right now, so please leave a message, and I'll call you back. Thank you. [door opens] Come on. [coughing] That was almost perfect, but then you kind of cough like a bitch. It's been ten years. Shit. Remember how you used to make me shot gun your hits because you'd say "Joints burnt my throat"? They did burn my throat. Come on. You pulled filters off of Camels. I think you were just saying it 'cause you wanted to get close enough to kiss me. Yeah, right. I saw Dad today. And? He wanted to shoot me in the face. He's really sick. So, how is it being a parent? It's amazing how quickly I disappeared when Gracie was born. First kid's easy. Second kid changes everything. Why do you ask? I don't know. I think I could've made a good father. For real. I mean, I love your little people. See this water? We test the PH of this water. It's perfect. I don't even swim. God, pot is so-- Wow. I forgot how much it makes you wan to-- Fuck? I was going to say dance, you pervert. Don't give me that cotillion bullshit.

That somehow I'd fall back in love with you? No. I'm here to let you know you made the right decision. (woman) I was back with your father this afternoon. He tried to shoot me in the face with a shotgun. That thing wasn't loaded. Oh, come on. He was just scared. He acted like he didn't know who I was. I don't know, Momma. This is a-- It's difficult shit for me to do. I know it is. [faded voice] Lucky me. I love you. [echoing] Love you, love you. Good morning. I'm going to the farmers' market. Does anyone need anything? You are going to the farmers' market? Mommy, can I come to the farm, too? No, I'm getting groceries. Of course you can come. I'll drop you at school afterwards.

But he's still got a /at of growing up to do, like you guys. I don't think Uncle Scott knows how to grow up. Maybe it was my fault Uncle Scott left. I did pressure him. Don't you ever think that. (Scott) Don't crowd him too much. (Charles) Uncle Scott. Hey, man, come here. Can you watch my horse for me? Hey... I decided to get here early and cut through all the red tape.

It's called a "ku". A fisherman gave it to me. It's kinda like a Mayan ying yang thing. Go get them, dude. Last up today is Charles Henderson. He'll be giving a report on the Aztecs. Charles? We-- We all know the Aztecs ruled all of Mexico before Cortes conquered them in 1533. Mexico City t-today stands on the ruins of the Aztec capital, Tenochtitlan. And the Aztecs were a highly advanced empire that reigned for 300 years over a nation larger than the United States, with the capital twice the size of London. But what most people don't know know is the way the Aztec nation reigned over so many people, was that they would capture anyone who opposed them, and sacrifice them to the gods. [audience gasps] So, what they did was they would take a conquistador, and each priest would get an arm or leg, and they would stretch him out over this rock, and the high priest would take this flint, this really sharp rock, and he would hold it above his head, in front of the Aztec nation, and he would slam it right through the breast bone. [cheering] And he would reach into the Spaniard's chest and he would rip out the heart. [cheering] And he would hold it out in front of the whole Aztec nation, still bleeding. And he would scream "To the Gods". [cheering] But none of that is in any of the history books. They don't teach that to kids. $0, it just goes to show that sometimes history is remembered the way grown ups wished it happened. And sometimes the truth just gets buried with the past. That's my boy. [cheering] Here you go. Keep the change. I appreciate it. Thanks. Hey, how are you doing, Louisa? Good. Where's Katherine? She went to Charles' assembly. Oh, okay. How are doing? I'm good. Thank you. What the-- Do you-- Do you-do you know anything about the-- Okay, guys, wash up your hands. They'll be here soon. So, why is there a goddamn horse in the back yard? Hey, Willie. How have you been? That horse, Moose, is mine actually. And I was thinking about giving it to your boy, Charles. What are you do-- He just showed up a couple of days. Why don't you ask him? They're here. Your father's here. What's he doing here? I told you. He's coming over for dinner for your-- No. Actually, you haven't told me a lot of things lately. Hello, Pappy. Hello. Hey, Dad. How are doing? Pa. Oh. Good to see you. Dinner's almost ready. Dad, you must be starving. Where's Joe? Who's Joe? He's been talking all day about playing bridge with his friend Joe. How can he play bridge if he's so sick? Is Joe your imaginary friend? No smoking in the house. So? This family's fucked. No shit. I've been saying that for years. Hey, do me un favor, pequeno. Don't tell them I s pea k ingls- I got you. Gracias. [Scott clears throat] George, how about you sit over here? I'm not sitting here. Oh, come on, Mr. Henderson. Where's Joe? I'm sure Joe will be here any minute. Now, come on, have a seat. How about you sit here? Ah, nice. Charles, would you just sit down, please? Thanks. Welcome to the family. I'd like to propose a toast to the two people who are the reason we're all here, George and Margaret. Here, here. Well, I think we should say thank you to Kathy. I have to say it's very generous of you to prepare this dinner in honor of our parents-- Why did you even come here? Mom told me to come, back in Tennessee. Sorry, come again? To be honest, she wanted me to come here and make amends with you. Get to know Charles and Gracie, see Dad. She gave me a whole list of things, and I got on my horse and here I am. Here to make peace with you. Excuse me, everybody, I'm not gonna get any-- Hey, hey. William, sit down. Mr. Henderson, why don't you read from Mrs. Henderson's journal? I marked the page. Go ahead. Read what the missus wrote. It's okay. Beautiful flowers. "I arrived at the house today, "and found William and Katherine. "They really do make such a fine couple. "William once said to me "that he knew Katherine was the one "the first time Scott brought her home. "It's a very odd place to be as a mother, "having both sons be in love with the same woman. "I think "about Scott "all the time. "It's my greatest hope "William and Scott will make up "and be brothers again. "And love each other. "Scott reminds me [sobs] "so much of his father. "I h-hope they reconnect "while our George is still George." [creaking] Oh. Scott? I'll be back. [grunts] [grunts] [grunts] He's ready. [Scott groaning] Dad, Dad! Charles. Call the ambulance! Katherine, call the ambulance! Scott. Scott. Scott. Do you hear me? Scott. Jesus. Hurry! Scott. Come on, Scott. Mr. Henderson? Yeah. May I, please, see you a moment? What's happened? Is he okay? He's stable, but he's in a level three coma. What does that mean? Was it an overdose? He has a history of drug abuse. Uh, your brother never told you he was being treated in Tennessee for a glioblastoma? A type of brain tumor. Wait a second. What? They found it a year ago during a routine MRI. Because it's a spectrum of symptoms, everything from intense migraines to hallucinations. I'm surprised he's lasted this long. He's going into oncology for a CAT scan. You can probably see him tomorrow. .0 Precious memories .0 J How they linger J .0 Precious memories .0 J Flood my soul J .0 In the stillness .0 J Of the midnight J .5 Precious sacred Scenes unfold .5 .0 Precious father .0 J Loving mother J Fly across The lonely years J Hi. Does he have a name? Moose. Moose. He's a good looking horse. Are you and mom getting a divorce? Hey, why would you ask me that? Mom's always busy. You're always working late or out of town. This usually indicates the involvement of a third party. Um, well, maybe, maybe I've just lost track a little bit. You know what we're going to do? You and me? We're going to build Moose here a great stable to live in, okay? How does that sound? [sighs] "After five days of rain, "the sun is finally shining. "George and I had dinner with Katherine and William, and baby Charles last night. "They gave us wonderful news. "I'm going to be a grandmother again. "I remember the day "when Katherine said she was pregnant with Charles. "It brought so much joy to our family. "We threw all the calendars out the window. "Even though "the time Katherine last saw Scott "and started seeing William, "it was only the difference of a few weeks. "Katherine was my second son's first love "and my first son's true love. "Charles was born "nine months after Scott left. Our family never mentions this. "If you don't say it out loud, then it's not true." Hey, sorry, I just got your message. ls everything okay? Yeah, everything's fine. He and the kids are in the den with Viola. Okay. My mom's journals? She paints our stories so beautifully. Makes us all seem so together. Yeah. So, Scott has another CAT scan tomorrow, and I had Andy put a call into the specialist in Houston and-- He sent me a plane ticket. It was right after we said, "I love you" for the first time. If was like he knew or felt' that I moved on. I never told you. Because he was too late. I was right where I wanted to be. I should go check on the kids. Hold on a minute. I miss you. I love you. I love you, too. Ana' the tags poking up out of the back of your dad's jacket. It was our first date. You had me so nervous I was all discombobulated. And all I wanted to do was just be home with you. You know. Yeah. (William) I just want to be us again. You know? I do. (Charles) "I don't know how a person is supposed to act "when someone they love dies. "I guess everyone reacts in different ways. "I was lucky enough to know Uncle Scott "for a grand total of four days. "And here's how I'd sum him up "in three lines. "He was a fire bellied toad who took a chance and became a prince for a day."
