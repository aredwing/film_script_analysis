She was next to me. It was weird. She stood there, close, without saying a word. And after? What happened? I touched his arm. Is that all? It was as if it was my arms. My skin, not his. And you want to break up with Jessica just because of this dream? Stay with it, it would be a lie. I call this weekend. You should wait until Monday. Hi, man. We go to Billy's in 15 minutes. We will have a drink with the guys. And guess what? Paul comes. Paul goes to Billy's? He said that since his heart attack, he feels younger every day. - Are you coming? - Yes. I really can not. I have to go shopping. Another time. Salvation. Hi, Dad. Hi, man! - It was at the school? - Yes. You finally try to fix it? I try. Do not laugh! Joshua? Nicky? - Hi, Mommy. - Hi, sweetie. Guess what? After ten years of complaints, you'll finally be able to sleep without earplugs. Will you stop snoring? No, but I managed to mitigate groans nuisance our bed. Go ahead, try it. Are you kidding, eh? So you just try the bed? I like your way of thinking. To work! This bed is killing me! Shit! Nicky! It should be gone in 5 minutes! What is it? I forgot the game. What?
