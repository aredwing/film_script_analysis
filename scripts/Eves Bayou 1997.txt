My brother Poe was nine, and my sister Cisely had just turned 14. The town we lived in was named after a slave. It's said that when General Jean Paul Batiste was stricken with cholera, his life was saved by the medicine of a slave woman called Eve. In return for his life, he freed her and gave her this piece of land by the bayou. Perhaps in gratitude, she bore him 16 children. We are the descendants of Eve and Jean Paul Batiste. I was named for her. (Cajun music playing) He'd better grab it now while it still fits in his hands. From what I hear, it ain't just him giving it. Do tell. Don't let nothing fall out, or I might have to catch you. Don't hurt yourself with that thing. Harry... why do you always do that when we're drunk? Put down the camera, darling. My baby Mozelle thinks pictures make her look fat. Put down the damn camera. Harry. Here's your favorite niece. Oh, there she goes. Hold on, sweetness. Hey, Red. What you got for me, baby? A kiss and a chocolate... for a price. Well... what do I get for this? Two kisses and all the chocolates you can eat. That's my baby. Here you go, sweetie. - Thank you. - Eve? Where did you get those delicious-looking chocolates? You told me to help serve, Mama. This tastes kind of good. Crunchy. Well, don't just stand here and let Harry eat them all. Mama: There's my baby boy. Are you having a good time, honey? Chocolates, Poe? They're beans. Chocolate-covered beans. Eve Batiste! "Tybalt, Mercutio, the prince expressly hath forbidden bandying in Verona streets." Really, make yourselves useful. Help me with the champagne. - Vive les Batiste! - Bonne chance et bonne sant. Merde! Oh, you in trouble now. Look at Daddy. You must be so proud. Your son is the best colored doctor in all of Louisiana. Every goddamn woman in the parish thinks Louis's the Second Coming. I used to be able to keep up with you. You're just out of practice, that's all. Come on, baby doll, let's show them how to dance. Hey, can't my daughter dance? Louis: Elle sait danser, eh? Hey, Red. Red? Do you want to dance? No, thanks. (squeaking) - Woman: I can't see a thing. - Louis: Just hold on to my hand. (moans and kisses) (clinking) (Eve sobs) Come here. Shh... Breathe, come on. Breathe deeply. Deep breaths. Deep breaths. That's right. - That's right. - (Eve sobs) Sorry. I was asleep. It's okay, baby. You scared us too. You remember Mrs. Mereaux? Almost gave me a heart attack. Sorry I scared you, Mrs. Mereaux. Matty, would you mind going inside and fixing me a drink while I talk to my daughter? Of course not. Good night, Eve. Good night, Mrs. Mereaux. Would you like to go outside? - Hey, Willie. - Bonsoir, Louis. Daddy loves you so much. I know. I know you know. Do you love Mama? Your mama... is the most beautiful... perfect woman I ever met. Your mama's a lady. And I'll always love her. Always. Understand? Daddy? Yes, baby. How come you never dance with me? How can you say your daddy never dances with you? When we're alone and stuff. But not at parties. You always dance with Cisely. Tell you what. From now on... we'll dance at every party. All right? (Louis chuckles) Mama: There you are. I was looking for you two. Eve... it is past midnight. Your cohorts are already in pajamas. I was talking to Daddy. Well, I guess that's legal. Hey, you. Are you sober? Yes, Ma'am. Just barely. Did you have fun tonight? I bet you did. Go say good night to Uncle Tommy before I put him down. - I have to? - Yes, Ma'am. Then, straight to bed. And don't forget to say your prayers. Never cheat the man upstairs. Good night, Mama. Good night, Daddy. Good night, baby. Night night. What's wrong with her? Oh, she'll be all right. - And what about you? - What about me? You sober? Barely. - You're coming in? - In a minute. Hey, Uncle Tommy, I came to say good night. Hi. Hi. Oui, une grande party. Cocktails... you didn't miss anything. It was boring. Boring... Yeah... well, good night. Boring... Hey. Where were you? - I looked all over. - (Eve sniffles) I was outside with Daddy. Then I said good night to the croaker. Before that. I was in the carriage house. You was in there a long time. (Eve sobs) I fell asleep. What's wrong, rabbit? What's the matter? What? - What is it? - Nothing. Hey, don't tell me it's nothing. What's wrong? I saw Daddy. I was asleep and I woke up... and Daddy... - What? - Daddy and Mrs. Mereaux. What about Daddy and Mrs. Mereaux? I saw them kissing. Don't be stupid. Daddy wouldn't touch that cow. It's true, I saw them. He had his hands on her. It's true. He was all up against her, and her dress was... - That's a lie! - I saw them! He was all up against her and her dress was up - and they were rubbing. - Shh! Stop it. Just stop it. I'm going to tell you what happened. - What? - I can't see a thing. Just hold on to my hand. Cisely: They came in to get some more wine... and Daddy told her a joke. And she fell against him laughing. - And they woke you up. - (glass clinking) You sure? I'm certain. What would Daddy want with Matty Mereaux? Mama's the most beautiful woman in the world. Go to bed. It's late. You scared me. Louis: God damn it, Harry, wait. Harry: I'm leaving, I'm driving, I'm taking my damn wife... - No, no, no. - Mozelle. You'll either let Mozelle drive... or you'll stay here tonight, or I'll whip your ass. Shit, get your hands off me. I may be drunk, but I'll whip your butt. - Come on! - Stop it, assholes! Now, what is your monkey ass gonna do, huh? Just because you're a doctor, you think you know everything? - You don't know everything. - God damn it, Harry! Cisely: Daddy, Uncle Harry. Stop it. It's late. You want to raise the dead? Go back to bed. You're not dressed and it's bedtime. Not till Daddy comes in. Toi, t'es un vrai cochon parfois. Fuck you, doc, I'm sick of your shit. - Come here. Come on! - Give me the damn keys! Now get into the goddamn car before I kill you. (Louis laughs) Mozelle: Dis bonsoir, Harry. - Good night. - Good night, slugger. Bonsoir, Mozelle. - Nighty, Mozelle. - Nighty, Mozelle. Night, Harry. Good night, y'all. Be good. Good night, Red. Good night, Cisely. - Fuck you, Doc. - Shut the hell up. What do I get for this? Woman: I don't know why the Lord sees fit... Good night, Red. (phone rings in the distance) Mama: Mozelle, are you... Oh, my God. Louis, Louis, wake up! Red: God bless Uncle Harry... May God bless Uncle Maynard... and Uncle Anderson. (knock on door) (whispering) Aunt Mozelle, wake up. What for? You got clients coming. Harry's voice: Mozelle. Eve: You don't look so bad. I loved them... I swear I did. Eve: I know. It's not your fault they die. Which one did you love best? I don't know, Eve. They was all different. Anderson was the handsomest man I've ever seen. Your uncle Harry, he was the sweetest. And Maynard... Maynard loved me most of all. Even when I was your age, before I ever did the counseling, I could look at people, complete strangers, and see their lives. But I looked at each of my husbands... and never saw a thing. That's the way it always is... blind to my own life. (bell ringing) Eh bien... now go and... make yourself invisible for a while. If you're quiet... you'll be able to hear. I'm so sorry about Harry. I don't know why the Lord sees fit... We're all servants of divine will. The Lord giveth and taketh away. Oh, well. Close your eyes. Lord, lead us in the direction of righteousness. Advise us that we may become wiser in Thy will. - Amen. - Amen. Speak your mind, my friend. It's my boy. My boy's ran off and I don't know where. My husband and I have been praying for two months. And I pray for patience, but... I can't take it anymore. I have to know. (sirens blasting) He's alive, Hilary. You'll find him in Detroit, at St. Michael's Hospital. Next Tuesday. Is he sick? Tell me. Your son's on drugs. Go home and pray for strength. You'll need strength to help you through this. Mozelle: The money is gone, Madame Renard. Your niece spent it all. I'm sorry. (sobbing) Oh, help me. My God. How will I live? Please, help me. I want you to get a small bag made of skin of chamois. In it, place this piece of moon stone and John Conqueror root. Tie it with a piece of devil shoestring. And in your right hand, sprinkle five drops of holy oil. Thank you, Madame. I'm in no position to repay your kindness - with my money gone. - C'est rien, ma chre. Keep the bag next to your skin. I'm so sorry about your husband. He was such a fine man. Thank you. Don't be cute. You told Daddy you don't practice no voodoo. She was desperate. Does it work? We'll see. What if it don't? I don't think she'll sue me. (Mozelle chuckles) Mozelle: Oh Lord. What is it now? (faint) What did you say? Ros: I said, I've got three of his damn babies. I can't stand that woman called my house! There is nothing in this world lower than eavesdropping - on the conversation of others. - This is important. If they wanted you to hear, they'd have left the door open. - I'm telling. - (both gasp) Women have been lying about this ever since God invented them. Daddy. Hey, Cis. You're in trouble. Go to Kings and come back later. - They're really mad. - Who's mad, baby? Who, them? They're always mad. People fantasize about their doctors... No, don't talk, Louis. - I feel like I'm falling. - I'll catch you. Don't. - Eve: He's that old? - Yeah. Eve: He seems like he's 100. Not 100. I think he used to go out with grand-mre. H uh? They do seem like they could make a good couple. You really think so? Wait, grand-mre doesn't really seem like she's that old. Oh, grand-mre is old, let me tell you. You've been taking your pills. Good girl. Yes, Doctor, I'm feeling much better. Everything will be just fine. Yes, everything's going to be just fine. As long as you keep taking your pills. - Good bye, Mrs. Renard. - Bye. Yes, Lord... everything will be just fine. Your lungs are clear as a bell, Stevie. I think you'll live. Doctor... could you give me something for the pain? Eve... go on outside and play. What pain is that, Stevie? What was wrong with that lady? Mrs. Hobbs? Some illnesses are hard to put a finger on. - Is she having a baby? - No. Why do you ask? Do you ever want other kids? No, your mother and I are happy with the three kids we've got. No, I mean, other kids... besides us. Open your mouth and say, "Aaah." No, I don't see anything in there that would make you say something so stupid. I got to go to the hospital. I have to take you home. Oh no. Please, Daddy. Tell you what, I'll race you. - I'll give you a head-start. - Okay. Bye! (whistling) We're supposed to be cheering each other up. I know. I was just wondering what happened with that woman. I supposed he fixed it. He knows how to fix things. When I first met Louis, I watched him set this boy's leg who'd fallen out of a tree. I said to myself, "He's a man who can fix things. He's a healer. He'll take care of me." So I leave my family... and I move to the swamp... and I find out he's just a man. We're two of a kind, my brother and I. One day, he'll turn around... and he will see you for the first time. And then he'll stop looking for what he already has. What if it's too late? Let's eat pomegranates till our hands turn red... and all we can think about is getting the juice off. Mo, let's get our fortunes drawn. Not by her. Come on, you said you wanted to cheer me up. She couldn't predict heat in August. Mozelle Batiste... if I didn't know you better, I'd say you have a case of professional jealousy. Roz, I am a psychic counselor. Elzora is a sideshow attraction. Then there's nothing to be afraid of. Which one first? My sister-in-law's something of a skeptic. But I'd very much like my fortune drawn. Sit down. Empty it. You're in pain, my daughter. Yes. There is an end to your problem... though not one you imagined. Stay quiet... and wait. Wait? Sometimes a soldier falls on his own sword. In three years time, you will be happy again. Three years? Look to your children. Dollar. That's it? Just wait three years and everything will be fine? Look to your children. Thank you. I feel most enlightened. Good afternoon. - You were right. Come on. - Wait. Some things are better left unsaid. I paid you a dollar, old woman. No, tell my fortune. I don't need no cat bones to tell your fortune. You are a curse! A black widow. Next man who marries you is a dead man. Like the others. Always be that way. Sale menteuse! You're an old lying witch! Wait a minute. For heaven's sake, what did she say? It's all right, it's just... I need... Come on, let's not be in the street. Mo. It's dead. Are you sure? It's not moving, is it? Maybe it's just sick. It's dead, you little chicken. (both scream) Oh, Cisely, thank Heavens. Where are Eve and Poe? - Mom, I don't know. - (distant screaming) Oh, Lord. Are you all right? Just go. Don't ask me. Just go. You're going to lock these kids up in the house for the summer 'cause of what that fortune teller told you? She kept saying, "Look to your children." And no sooner do we leave, that Mozelle has this vision - of a child getting hit. - (laughs) Roz, I love my sister, but she's not unfamiliar - with mental hospitals. - Not in front of the children. - They know. - Of course, we know. - Poe: Know what? - Aunt Mozelle is crazy. Eve: She is not! She knows things. People trust her. Sweetheart, Aunt Mozelle's a little eccentric. We let her tell fortunes to keep her out of trouble. She may be crazy, but them visions always come true. Anyway... I've made up my mind. - They're staying in the house. - Till when? Well, I don't now. Till Mozelle says it's safe. - Can't believe I'm hearing this. - What if we don't play in traffic? Don't you use that tone of voice with me. And don't roll your eyes at your father behind my back. You're looking right at us, Mama. Nothing ever happens behind your back. Don't talk back to your mother. - You're not too big to beat. - Don't threaten my daughter, Mama. You let her threaten me. When I was growing up, children did not participate in a conversation of adults. You can let them kids back talk and run wild if you want to. You won't hear another word out of me. In my day, we were thankful for signs and warnings. Let the little hooligans get run over. a va plus tranquille autour d'ici. Could be much quieter around here. I want to thank you for the delightful family chat. - I have patients to see. - Louis... - it's Sunday. - When you manage to put sickness on an eight-hour, five-day schedule, let me know. - Why can't they wait a day? - Are you two gonna fight? "Some sicknesses are hard to put a finger on." I'll be back as soon as I can. Which one of your patients are you going to see? Woman, go get your palm read, let me do my work. You love your daddy, baby? - You know I do. - That's all I need. Excuse me, darling. Don't you think you're being a little immature? I beg your pardon? Keeping us in the house 'cause Mozelle's seeing things, and not wanting Daddy to go to work. What's wrong with you? If you're lucky, you might live long enough to one day have a husband and children. But until then, this is my house and you'll do as I say. Do you understand? I said, do you understand? Yes, Ma'am. Good. No one leaves this house until I say so. "What a man art thou, that, thus be screened in night, So stumblest on my counsel? "By a name... I know not how to tell thee who I am. My name, dear saint, is hateful to myself Because it is an enemy to thee." (heavy sigh) What are you doing in there?! Cisely: Go away. Ah! Ouch! God damn it! Ferme ta gueule, hein? I heard you. You said, "God damn it." Eve. You shouldn't be sneaking up on people when they're swearing. - Does it hurt? - What? Your finger, Mother. No, not too much. You'll cut your finger off one of these days. "Tis not so deep as a well... Nor so wide as a church door... But 'tis enough, 'twill serve." Romeo and Juliet. What? We've read most of the tragedies. We're starting on the goddamn comedies. You are asking to get hit. - (distant scream) - Baby? The Lord have mercy. What happened, baby? You all right? Mozelle: Hey, everybody. Hi, Mo. Poe, are you all right? Look what I found in the attic... a Monopoly board and Chinese checkers. You could find the czar of Russia in that attic. I despise Chinese checkers. Poe: I hate her! I wish she was dead! I feel like I walked into the middle of a cyclone. Eve... what did you do to your brother? I'll push him out of a window if I don't get out! Cisely has been in the goddamn bathtub for an hour. She stayed in it three hours yesterday. There's more than one bathroom in this house. Ain't that much dirt in all of Louisiana. Get out of the damn tub! You watch your language, young lady. Mama keeps stabbing herself in the kitchen. - Show her your hands. - You'd better hush. And where is Daddy? He's never home. He's supposed to be home sometimes. Listen, you little ingrate. Your father works hard so we can have a house with four bathrooms. He's not working every night. I know he's not. - I mean... - Let me borrow you for a minute. Poe? Is that your idea of being a good daughter? It's true. He never comes home, and it's making her nervous. She cuts herself. And you're being helpful bringing it up? She's nervous 'cause he's messing with other women. What did you say? Nothing. Play games with me and I'll slap you blind. - It's true, I saw them. - You saw who? You have five seconds. Daddy and Mrs. Mereaux. God. It was at the party. I was in the carriage house and they didn't see me. And it was worse than just kissing... Shh. Let me think a minute. Have you told anyone? - No. - Well, that's good. Because if you tell anyone, anyone at all... I'm going to kill you. And if you get callous again with your mama's feelings, I swear I'll do you harm. - You understand me? - Yes, Ma'am. Listen... your daddy loves you, - and he loves your mama. - I know. We are a lot the same, your father and I. Except I don't have no children to catch me. You all are my children. That's why Maynard got tired of me, 'cause I'm barren. But... Maynard loved you. Maynard loved you most of all. I think he did. But I didn't know that until I met Hosea. - Tell me about Hosea. - You're too young to understand. But when I was with Hosea, it was like my whole body was burning. I'd come home and have to rub ice on my face and neck to cool down. If Maynard knew, he never said a word. Then one night, Hosea showed up at the door. He said, "Pack your bags. I've come to take you with me." And God help me... I pushed past my startled husband. I was going upstairs to pack my bags, when I heard Maynard say in a tone I'd never heard him use, "I don't care who you are, sir, but if you don't leave my house at once, I will hurt you." And I turned just in time to see Hosea pull a gun out and aim it at Maynard. "I'm in love with your wife, and if you try to stop us, I'll kill you." Maynard walked right up and pushed his chest in the barrel of that gun, and he said, "Well, then, you'll have to kill me because my wife ain't going nowhere." Oh, Eve... in that moment, I knew that I loved Maynard. He was so calm and brave... and it was Hosea who was trembling. Maynard said... "Mozelle... tell this man you ain't going nowhere with him so he can get the hell out of my house." Mama was standing in the doorway of the kitchen and she was holding her heart like this. I walked slowly over... and I stood next to my husband... and I looked at my lover... this man who had lit this great fire in me, and said, "Please, leave our house. I never want to see you again." Hosea's eyes went another color and he stopped trembling. He looked right at me... and he said... Hosea: All right, then. (gunshot) And he shot Maynard in the chest. And I was alone... for a while. (knock on door) - Can I help you? - I need Mozelle Batiste. I am. Am I disturbing you? I don't know yet. My name is Julian Grayraven. Folks around here say you read the future. Julian: My wife left me a year ago. I've been to many cities, searching for her. I have no place to return to anymore. I'm exhausted. I cannot continue and yet... I cannot stop until I know. Where is my wife? Now, darling I think I really love you... - Daddy, it's late. - What are you doing up? Waiting for you. What do you think I'm doing up? (heavy sigh) What's your pleasure this evening, Doctor? Scotch and water, bartender. Where's your mama? Everybody's asleep, Daddy. Mom was nervous. So grand-mre gave her a tablet. That woman's got every pill in the world. Speaking of the infirm... guess I better check on Tommy. Maybe I'll take him out for a late-night stroll. Or should I say, roll. I think you're drunk. Mmm... I've delivered babies drunker... conceived babies much drunker. Daddy! Did I ever tell you about the night we made Poe? No. I got in a fight with some knucklehead over at Kings and came to under the pool table. Now, Roz was sore at me about something, so she hadn't spoken to me in about a week. I thought, " Damn... the woman finds out I've been drinking and fighting, she'll leave me." Anyway, they take me home, and she sees me all messed up, and she starts weeping, and kissing me, and kissing me, and weeping, and nine months later... Poe. Do you still love her? Sweetheart... let me tell you something. When I met your mom... men fought each other for the privilege of speaking her name. She was so pretty, it was painful just to look at her. And she could dance almost as good as you. But not quite. No, not quite. But holding Roz was like holding your favorite feather pillow. The one you just can't sleep without. - And now? - Well... you know how it is with feather pillows. Over the years, they get lumpy and deflated. You have to fluff them up all the time to keep them... comme un pelochon. - Daddy! - (both laugh) - Hey, Daddy. - Hey, pumpkin head. Look who's up. Do you know what time it is? It's time for you girls to be in bed. - No, Daddy. - Yes. Your mama would kill me if she found out I had you up. I'll just finish my drink, check on Tommy, then I'm headed to bed myself. Night, night owls. Night, Daddy. (hammering) I want a Sunday... Kind of love A love to last Past Saturday night And I'd like to know It's more than love at first sight I want a Sunday kind of love Sunday, Sunday, Sunday... Kind of love. Eve? Where's Cisely? Officer, I'm afraid she might be hit by something. Being like it is today, there's bound to be accidents. Mama, please! Cisely! Oh God! Oh thank God. Thank God. Why did you run off like that? You almost gave your mama a heart attack! Where the hell did you go?! I went to visit Daddy. Then I went to the beauty parlor. You what? I walked all the way to Daddy's office, and then I caught the bus to Opal's. I had to cross the train tracks to get home. And I'm alive, Mama. I didn't get hit by anything. Roz: Come here, Cisely. When I was your age, I was just like you. I thought I knew everything. Now, even the things I'm most familiar with seem mysterious to me. But I know I love you. And it's my job to protect you as best I can. If you disobey my orders, or leave this house again, I swear I'll lock you in your room. Yes, Ma'am. Go back to bed. I'm waiting up for your father tonight. I don't want you waiting up for him anymore. But, Mama... I'll say it one more time, Cisely. I know you love your daddy. And your daddy loves you. I don't want you waiting up for him anymore. Cisely! Did you hear me? Yes, Ma'am. But you don't understand him. And you'll drive him away from us! I'll never forgive you. If you drive him away... (loud arguing) Roz: I am sick... You get yourself straight, or you're out of here! Mozelle: Isn't it beautiful? Julian: You're beautiful. Mozelle... it's time for me to go. I have to find my wife. Mr. Grayraven, I told you she's not coming back. I have to find my wife so that I can... divorce her... and marry you. Oh, Julian... it's enough that you're here with me. You have made me so happy. But you can't possibly marry me. I can't let that happen. - Is it that you don't love me? - No! No, it's not that. It's... bear with me. I'm cursed. I can't have children. I'm barren. You're not barren. You're wounded... here. And it's here that I'll plant seeds. (distant honking, tires screeching) - (car crashing) - (woman screaming) We're free! And tonight, we'll barbecue outside - and have a picnic! - I'm going outside! C'est pas juste de fter quand I'enfant de quelqu'un est mort. These children have been in the house for weeks! Go get Cisely. She hasn't come down all morning. I think she's still mad at me. Cisely! It is not right to celebrate when somebody's child is dead. Well, whose child was it anyway? Dickey's boy. Wake up, we're free! We can go outside now. Cisely! Cisely: Go away. Cisely! Some other kid got hit. We're free! - Go away! - Ow! Oooh... so that's what's wrong with you. Look, you think just 'cause you got blood in your pants you don't have to act civilized no more? Shut up! Cisely's got her period. I'm gonna tell Daddy. (Cisely screams) No! Mama! Cisely's trying to kill me. Cisely's trying to kill me. Help! Mama! - She's trying to kill me! - Julian: Come on. What happened? I don't know what happened. It's like she went crazy. We thought she was having a seizure. We were so scared. Is it my fault, you think? 'Cause I hit her. No, Roz. It's not your fault. Let me look at her. Louis. She started her period. - Did you know that? - No. Roz: She didn't even tell me. Go away, Daddy. I don't want you here. I just want to take your pulse and your temperature, baby. - Doctor stuff. - No! I don't want you looking at me. Okay. I know a nice lady doctor we can take you to. Would you like that? (humming "Amazing Grace") Excuse me? How much for this pineapple? I said, how much for this pineapple? 25. You want it? That's too much. Man: Hey! Arr tez-la! Bad girl. Mchante fille! Bad girl. Eve: I'm going to beat you, 'cause you are a chicken! She blames me for not making you happy. She thinks I'm driving you away. She's a child, Roz. Just give her time. How much time, Louis? It's already been two weeks. She won't eat, she won't speak. It's like she's sleepwalking. Louis: This... psychologist fellow seems to think you need kind of a... vacation from us. It's just a suggestion. We'd never send you away unless you wanted to go. Listen... whatever it is, we can work it out together. Everything's going to be fine again. I promise. I want to go. What? What did you say, baby? I said I want to go. It's all settled. I talked to grand-mother... and she just can't wait to see you. If you leave me alone with them, I'll die. I'll die, Cisely. What's wrong with you? Why won't you tell me? Is it me? Is it something I did? Why won't you talk to me? Of course it's not you, rabbit. You're my only friend. Then... what is it? Tell me. I promise I won't tell anybody. Do you remember the storm? The day you cut your hair and Mama hit you? Did you hear Mama and Daddy fight that night? Yeah. Part of it was about me... and how he let me visit him that day. The other thing they were fighting about... was Matty Mereaux. Mama knows about Daddy and Matty? Everybody knows. She's been hanging around his office in front of everyone. You believe me now about what happened at the party? I believed you then. Anyway... I waited until I heard Mama go upstairs. I went downstairs. I was afraid of what she might have said. I was afraid he would divorce us. I wanted to make him feel better. I sat on his lap... and I was scared. I was trying to get away and he was hugging me and kissing me, until I finally pushed him away with my knee. I must have hurt him because... he's never hit me. Louis: Sorry... Then I ran. I'll kill him, Cisely. I swear! I'll kill him for hurting you. Bye bye, baby. Roz: I'll be gone a week or so. I want to get her settled in. Bye, Poe. Louis: I'll just drop them off. I'll be back before dinner. - Maybe he ran into traffic. - It's Sunday. He'll be back, and so will Cisely. I know she will. Life is filled with goodbyes. A million goodbyes. And it hurts every time. Sometimes, I feel like I've lost so much, I have to find new things to lose. All I know is, there must be a divine point to it all, and it's just over my head. When we die, it will all come clear, and we'll say, "So that was the damn point." And sometimes I think there's no point at all, and that's the point. All I know is most people's lives are a great disappointment to them. And no one leaves this earth without feeling terrible pain. And if there is no divine explanation at the end of it all, well, that's sad. How do you kill someone with voodoo? (Mozelle chuckles) I almost forgot you was there. I mean, do you just wish real hard they were dead? Or do you have to do something special? I suppose you put some of their hair on a doll and stick pins in it or something. I don't know. What makes you ask a thing like that? Nothing. You must have been thinking something right before you were thinking that. What led you to that particular thought? I don't know. Is there someone around here that you're angry with? Someone that you want dead? - I'm going inside. - You better tell me what's on your mind. You have five seconds. Give me your hands. Give them to me. Go on and keep secrets if you want to. I won't squeeze it out of you. But you can't kill with voodoo. That's ridiculous. Hey, Red. Didn't mean to startle you. - Hi, Mr. Mereaux. - Hi. - How's your family? - Everybody's fine. - How's Matty? - Same as always. Salty and sweet. - What are you looking for? - H umm... - apples. - Apples? You know, you just walked right past them. Oh, thanks. Lord have mercy. - Mr. Mereaux? - Yes, Eve. You're still teaching? Sure, darling. Down at Xavier, in New Orleans. Been there for years. - That's a long drive. - Yeah. Sometimes if the weather's bad, I just stay on campus. But usually, I try to get home, so Matty don't get too lonely. Matty don't seem like the lonely type. No... I guess not. You must get home real late. Well, when you get home. Sometimes. So does my daddy. Every night. My mama gets real lonely. But then, she is the lonely type. Not like Daddy and Matty. Well... bye. Excuse me. Mchante petite fille. I remember you, pineapple thief. Hi. I've been looking for you. Only people who look for me got a good reason. - I got a good reason. - You got money? - $20. - 20... let me see. Give me. You stole that money from your daddy? - Why you think I stole it? - You didn't get it laying bricks. Come. Follow me. Eve: Where are we going? My office. Are you related to Mozelle Batiste? I'm her niece. - And she's the one you want dead. - No, someone else. Mmm... too bad. Tant pis. Why you want this person dead? - Pour quoi faire? - Raison prive. Did this person... harm you? Others in my family. I will give you something to protect you and your family. I want him dead! For certain? You are sure? Yes, Ma'am. People have a way of dying at their own speed. But I will see what I can do. I will need some hair... from the head of this person. I brought you some from a comb. I hope it's enough, though. Well... eh bien... woman, don't be too weak. You come back Thursday night, and we'll see. We'll see. Get the hell off my property before I cook you and eat you! Is that you, pineapple thief? Come. I thought you was one of those town kids who was bothering me. Is he dead yet? How could he be dead? - You didn't give me the doll. - What doll? I didn't say nothing to you about no doll. The voodoo doll. I didn't make you no voodoo doll. I made you a wax coffin. I put his hair inside the mouth of a snake, and buried it in the graveyard. - He should be dead by now. - I thought I had to do something, like stick pins in it or... You did something! You brought me his hair. - And you paid me $20. - But... I wanted it. I wanted to have it. I need it! Oh God. Where... - where did you bury it? - Down there. Where all them Batistes are buried. But I don't think you'll find it. You said you wanted him dead. You said you was certain. (woman laughs hysterically) (loud music plays) Daddy! Oh Daddy, I'm so happy to see you. What are you doing over here at this time of night? What's wrong? Is it grand-mre? H umm... Daddy, let's go home. Please, I want you to come home with me. Of course, baby. You walked all the way over here? - What's wrong? - Man: You've been busted, Doc. The last one's on me. Go outside while I say good night to Miss Mereaux. Hurry up. Oh, hey, Mr. Mereaux. Hey, baby. Hey, just in time to have a last one with us. - I don't think so, Louis. - What's wrong? You crazy? - You fucking my wife? - Don't be ridiculous. - You're fucking her? - You're drunk. You like her? She's very beautiful. You fucking her? Matty and I are old friends. You know that as well as anyone. I trusted you, Louis. And you've been fucking Matty. I loved you, Louis. I love you, Lenny. Come on, Daddy, let's go home. That's right. You're drunk. Let me take you home. Listen... you so much as speak to my wife again... and I will kill you. Do you understand? Bartender: Take it outside. Let's get the hell out of here. You go home sleep off that whiskey, old man. You'll apologize to me tomorrow. You speak to her again, you're dead, Louis. Come on, Daddy, let's go home. Please. Okay, baby. Night, Matty. No! Eve: Daddy! No! All: "Our Father, Who art in Heaven, hallowed be Thy name. Thy kingdom come, thy will be done on Earth as it is in Heaven..." No! "...as we forgive those who trespassed against us. And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil, for Thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory forever and ever." Amen. (Roz softly hums) Last night, I had a dream that I was flying. It was such a fine feeling. But in the corner of my eye, I saw a woman drowning in the very same air that was keeping me afloat. And I knew, without looking, it was me. Should I save her? And then I heard Louis' voice saying, "Don't look back." So I kept on flying... and I let her drown. When I woke up... I told Julian I would marry him. He wouldn't have it any other way. Maybe God will be kind and allow me to go with him. I'm so tired of being left alone. Your daddy gave me a message for you. "Tell Eve I still owe her a dance." "To Mozelle." "Mozelle, it's been two hours since we spoke and finally, I feel calm enough to write this. I realize that your accusations, however shocking and cruel, stem from some weakness in myself that allows you to believe the worst of me. As you and I know, I'm just a small-town doctor pushing aspirin to the elderly. But to a certain type of woman, I'm a hero. I need to be a hero sometimes. That's my weakness. That much is true. But how, Mozelle, could I have sunken your estimation to the leechy depths where you would accuse me of deliberately abusing my most beloved child? I am guilty in the sense that I adore her, and I allowed her to adore me. It was a sweet indulgence, but nothing in her behavior prepared me for what happened the night of the storm. Roz and I had a terrible fight and I guess it was inevitable. I knew Cisely could never sleep through a fight like that. So, I wasn't surprised when she came downstairs. Maybe I was even waiting for her. I let myself wallow and feel comforted. Mozelle, I swear... the first kiss was the sweetest kiss a daughter could give her drunk, guilt-ridden father. A kiss of redemption. And the next moment, it had gone wrong. From my scotch haze, it took me a second to realize that my daughter was kissing me like a woman. This is where I blame myself. I was so startled that I hit her and she fell to the floor. The look she gave me almost stopped my heart. And I knew I had lost her. Mozelle, I would give my life to have that moment back. I would hold her and comfort her. We would talk through her confusion and I'd put her to bed, with the boundaries between us intact. I love her more than my life. I hope that one day, she can forgive me. I felt I could not betray her again by telling you or Roz. Forgive me." Eve: Liar! Red? You lied to me about Daddy. You lied! Daddy wrote Mozelle a letter! - You lied! - I wasn't lying. I believed you... and I hated him. I hated him for you. He hurt me, Eve. He hurt me so badly... I wanted to die. Tell me what happened. Please. I have to know. I can't. Please. I don't know what happened. I don't know. - It's okay. - I can't. - I can't. - It's okay.
