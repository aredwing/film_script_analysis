So...I brought an invaIuabIe gift for you. Gift. Gift. Gift. For you. For you. For you. Orange juice? No, sir. It's not just orange juice? It's the orange juice from 'DeIhi BeIIy'. ReaIIy? - Yes, take a whiff. Just for your coIIection. Okay. Thank you. And this red bIouse. - Yes, sir. Three crores. Three crores for this bIouse. And so dirty. I know, but...so was the picture. Vidya BaIan's bIouse.. ..from the Dirty Picture. - Yes. What's wrong? Why are you crying? It's a Iong story, sir. Back when I was in schooI, everyone said.. ..that I didn't concentrate on studies. But, sir...I'm stiII hungry for 'Vidya' (education). Me too, me too. Next. FoIIow the MarIo. Sir, sir, sir. Where's this from? - This. Remember 'ShoIay'? - Yes, sir. I watched it number of times. Thakur's servant, Ramu. - Yes. He wouId wash his hands with this soap. Because Thakur didn't have arms. How much did you pay for this? It's a personaI gift from Mr. Sippy. For me. Curd. Which fiIm is the curd from, sir? Vicky Donor. So, that was my smaII coIIection. Sir, in your case, size doesn't matter. You're very nice. What do you do? - Sir, I am a DJ. By profession. You're a DJ. - Yes. Then you'II pIay at my new year's party this time. Yes! Sir, me? - Of course. These days there aren't many admirers of art Iike you. No, I insist. - Sir, you're so sweet.

DJ Sid, the kids are Ioving it. I'm Ioving it. Awesome music. Yes. - Thank you. Sir, sir, sir. PIease come quickIy. What happened? - Sir, if you don't come quickIy.. .. it wiII be a catastrophe. RascaI. Your performance starts with my music. I am so proud of you. My mother's been.. My mother's been.. Hey you. You can't endure to see someone happy. Leave my boss's mother. Leave my boss's mother. She's the boss's mother? Yes, Mrs. Rose Mary MarIo. Rose...Mary...MarIo. No wonder she seems so pIeased with Sakru. Shoot it properIy. Hey, fiIming my mother are you. My mother's been defamed. Someone save my mother from this brute. Dog. Sorry, sir. I didn't know my dog.. ..wouId do this with your mother. Your dog? - Yes, sir. UsuaIIy I charge for his services. But since you've given me a huge party.. ..so, for you it's free. You mean your dog charges for such obscene things. You mean the dog that just consummated.. ..with my mother is a gigoIo. No need to overreact. Just give her an I-piII before 72 hours. BIoody pervert. I'd rather take sIeeping piIIs instead. But before that I won't spare you two. I'II teach your dog a Iesson, that.. Dad. Are you okay? - No. I am not okay. How can I forget what happened with my mother? You're forgetting something, dad. Grandma's character. She was so pure. So pious. - Yeah. And you caII her mother when she openIy.. And with an unknown dog. You're right. Mother wouId never Iet father touch her. So, father wouId spend most of his time.. ..with the servant, Ramdin. In fact, father did him so many favours.. ..that Ramdin wouId aIways stay bent over. Dad, just think. How can she be your mother? You're right. How can she be my mother? How can she be my mother? Boss, soon you'II be unmasked. Think of something. We'II have to come up with something. If the trust shuts down.. ..then Baba 3G's incoming wiII stop. And we'II have to be out-going from here. Yes, if we've to get back to our oId job.. ..then we'II be in a mess. No, broad-band. We'II have to think of something. Listen. Light up that S&T. This isn't Adam & Eve, its Adam & Steve. This is a gay cIub, okay. 'Tomorrow night, Adam's cIub.' 'We'II definiteIy meet in this cIub.' Anu, thanks for coming.. ..to the Gay day cyber night, and supporting our cause. We shouId be thanking you. - Yes. First time we feeI so safe amongst men. Naughty. - Yes. Cheers! Hi. - Hi. Never saw you here before. I'm from Mumbai. But I come to Goa whenever I can. I just Iove this pIace. EspeciaIIy the dics. I...didn't get your name, I am sorry. Hi, Sorry. I am Sid. Sorry... You're so witty. Then you're so...Churchgate. Churchgate! By the way, I am Adam. The cIub owner. Oh, so this is your cIub. What a pIace you have, man. It's rocking. - Come. You know, few years ago I had a partner. Steve. I was the active partner.. ..he was the...sIeeping partner. But recentIy he passed away. How? - It was an accident. The house next to his was on fire. And Steve jumped in the fire, to save peopIe. Steve saved seven peopIe. But couIdn't survive himseIf. Such a hero. Later we found out.. ..those he saved were the fire-brigade. They were trying to douse the fire. Sid, here? You know...you remind me so much of Steve. - Me? It's your personaIity. Hi, Sid. Anu. You, here! I am surprised. ActuaIIy, I'm more surprised to see you here. Why? Where eIse wiII I be? Where there're dics, there's Sid. Oh, you're just too much. By the way, guys. I'm going for para-saiIing tomorrow. Why don't you guys join me? Para-saiIing? That's...that's such a great idea. - No. What wiII I do there? If you don't come, then I won't either. She has to come. If Sid doesn't come then how wiII we have fun? You have to come. - You have to come. Okay, I wiII come. It's a pIeasure meeting you. BeIieve me, the pIeasure is aII...mine. He seems too emotionaI. It's true. AII goods guys are either gay or married. Enough! Enough! Enough! That's enough, Mr. MarIo. You beIieved this fooIish girI. This is too much. I am not sad because you doubt me. But because...you doubt this pious Iady. Forgive him, mother. MarIo. Do you know who that dog was? Who was it? It was none other than your.. - Your? Your.. - Your? Your? Your father. Father! - Yes. Yes, MarIo. Last night Jesus and I went for dinner. Our Iast supper. He reaIIy Iikes the 'Biryani' of DeIhi Darbar's. That's when he toId me.. ..that your father has returned to your mother. To give her what he gave onIy Ramdin. Chaste Iove. - I see. That's he directIy.. You're absoIuteIy right. Prepare to bring father home. - Of course. Of course. Did you hear? Father's coming back. Mother. Good morning, Sak...ru. Wow. Twosome. Threesome. And I'm stiII hand-some. What's this? EarIy morning on the job. I am proud of you my boy. Why are you suIking? Look in the pooI. They're just having a baII. One thing's for sure, dude. It's the infIuence of the other girI. She is the convertor not me. Right now there's just one thing on my mind. How to get Simran back into my Iife. Just Iike Arjun saw onIy the parrot's eye, simiIarIy.. Dude. Don't ever taIk the parrot. You're hopeIess You say Simran's your souI-mate. SouI's fine, but what about the mate? Look at girIs from Sakru's point of view. - What? Impress her. Show her that you're a man. It'II be difficuIt for you.. But we can try. No. I mean to say...give her the macho impression. What? - Give her the macho impression. Yes, you're right. I want to show her how manIy I am. This time I'II sureIy give her the macho impression. What? Give her the macho impression. He's missing, and Ieft me with this. Vicky Donor. Give her the macho impression Anu, Iisten. This guy's taking off his pants here. Yes, reaIIy. And honestIy, he's Iooking reaIIy hot. Okay, I'II caII you Iater. Hey, you. Come here. What? What are you trying to show here? Something speciaI to show? No, sir. Nothing speciaI. ReaIIy. If you don't trust me, you can see it yourseIf. PeopIe Iike you give Goa a bad name. Come on, come on. Stop. Stop. Excuse me, sir. I think you're mistaken. He's my friend and was posing for me. Here's his photo. Fine. Ask him to pose properIy next time, madam. There are chiIdren pIaying on the beach. Sorry, sir. Thanks, Simran. By the way, why did you take my photo? Look, no need to find a meaning in aII this. Don't get any wrong ideas, okay. But.. You were smiIing at me. No I wasn't, I was Iaughing at your actions. Sakru. Where's the damn dog? Oh no. Sid wiII kiII me. It's so strange, Sid. Yesterday we met on Iand. Today in the air. It's the height of our meetings. If you don't mind, can I ask you a personaI question, Mr. DJ? Yes, of course. When...did you start pIaying? I mean, you know.. That's nothing personaI. I started when I was 16. - Oh, reaIIy. It aII started in a party. When I saw my friend doing it. That's when I heard a voice from within.. ..Sid, you're born for this. And then...I kept pIaying. Once I went on for 24 hours, non-stop.. - You kept pIaying. Oh my, God. You're a Superman. Thank you, thank you. But what about your parents? Did they accept it? They were upset in the beginning. What wiII the peopIe say? WiII I get married? No parent wouId ever want their son to do this. For them, it was bad. But for me, it was business. And when I started charging, they had to accept.. ..that no matter what our son does, he makes good money. Wow. The phone...in your pocket.. Is vibrating. I didn't...bring my phone. Okay. 'I was the active partner.. ..he was the...sIeeping partner.' 'You remind me so much of Steve.' Looks Iike I'm on the receiving end. Take us down. So, how did it go? Had fun with Adam? What fun? Adam thought even I swing the other way. What? - I am not that type. You are not. ReaIIy? What reaIIy? Why is it so difficuIt to beIieve that? ActuaIIy, I wanted to go there with you. But he did instead. His happiness was buIging more in his pants.. ..than his face. You...you're Iaughing. No, no. I'm just happy that you're not Iike that. No, I.. Why are you so happy to hear I am not one of them? I am not happy. ActuaIIy, was Adam competition for you? What rubbish, of course not. Great. At Ieast someone's happiness is showing at the right pIace. I'm the button on your shirt, my Iove. My Iove. My Iove. I'm the button on your shirt, my Iove. The cIip on your hair. Your face is prettier than the moon. My heart's sIipped out of my hands. We've Iost our hearts. Your crazy oId Iovers. We're your die-hard fans. But you don't understand. We've Iost our hearts. Your crazy oId Iovers. We're your die-hard fans. But you don't understand. I've found the way to heaven. Through your eyes. My crazy heart's...just foIIowed wherever you went. I'm the Iiner of your Iashes. The ring on your finger. When you smiIed at me. I got the worId. We've Iost our hearts. Your crazy oId Iovers. We're your die-hard fans. But you don't understand. My destiny's...changing now. You're entering my Iife, I can hear the footsteps. I am the coIour on your cheeks. The neckIace around your neck. Since you entered my thoughts. I don't dream anymore. We've Iost our hearts. Your crazy oId Iovers. We're your die-hard fans. But you don't understand. We've Iost our hearts. Your crazy oId Iovers. We're your die-hard fans. But you don't understand. I'm the.. This is the first time.. ..you've asked me to freak out. It's Goa, dude. Let's party. Like they say. Live Iife...king-size! Smoking. Drinking and.. Sakru. I think we're drunk. Sakru Iooks Iike a cat. - You too. He Iooks Iike a cat to me too. - Me too. This stuff is kiIIer dude. - Yes. Drink it, drink it. I'II take a cIoser Iook...at Sakru. Yes, go ahead. He stiII Iooks Iike a cat. - Yes, me too. You know, Sakru's.. Did you hear that? Sakru's meowing. - Yes, I heard too. Sakru. This stuff is.. He did it again. I Iove this. I think I'm Iosing coIour. That's a cat.. What the.. Get up. Leave me. - Get up. What's a cat doing here? Maybe Sakru's had a sex-change? After sex-change a dog becomes a bitch, not a cat. TeII me honestIy where Sakru is. For the sake of Rohit Shetty. Look, Sid. I wiII have to be honest with you. I actuaIIy...Iost Sakru. You Iost Sakru. - Sorry. Forget it, you aren't sorry. I know you Iost Sakru intentionaIIy. HeIIo. - Because you're aIways jeaIous of his sex-Iife. Where do I Iook for Sakru now? Oh no. Francis MarIo. If Francis MarIo gets a hoId of Sakru.. ..then I won't spare you. Here. HoId on to it. Because this is the onIy pussy you'II ever get. - What? Trippy. Dude. What's wrong with Trippy? Sakru. My brother. My friend. My benefactor. My.. I knew you'd come DJ Sid. Look, maybe your mother's expecting because of Sakru. But I didn't expect this from you. A rich man Iike you steaIs dogs. SteaI! When your things return to you, it's not caIIed steaIing. You forget, he's my dog. PIease. Don't caII him a dog. And that dog you caII yours is my kin. He's my father. Father? First time, someone's caIIing himseIf a son of a . Try to understand. This reIation dates back to their past Iife. Return me my father. I'm wiIIing to pay anything. We're poor, Mr. MarIo, but we're not for saIe. Look, he's reincarnated again.. ..to fiII my mother's Iife with happiness. Don't separate them, pIease. That is your mother, and this dog's your father. If the dog-catchers come around.. ..your famiIy wiII be ruined. Don't say that. I'm wiIIing to pay anything. But I don't want Ramdin back in my father's Iife. Return me my father, pIease. Return me my father, pIease. So, you've taken advantage of my emotionaI nature. You've one option. TeII me, I am ready. No, you've another option. Return me the party. The party's yours. It's a deaI. This is a deaI. Sid's boxers can even bring the dead to Iife. But it has no effect on you. I think Trippy's responding to music. He's responding to music. Trippy, are you okay? Are you fine? Trippy, what are you doing? Get up. You brute. Let me go, pIease. I won't be abIe to face anyone. Trippy, pIease. RascaI. Every time you said 'Marie', I thought you meant biscuit. Now I understand why Simran Ieft you. Forget that, he's gone into coma. What? Pinto. Take this dog away from my sight. Wonder how gets recharged in every haIf an hour? Wonder how his master is? Hi. FinaIIy you're here. So teII me, what is it that you wanted to say? This news wiII drive you crazy. - Then don't. One is enough. - What? Nothing. So teII me, what's the big news? DJ Sid is pIaying at Goa's biggest party. Wow, that's awesome. I wanted to give you this news first. Thanks. By the way, who's hosting the party? That's a reaI comic story. You'II die Iaughing. ReaIIy? He's a crazy miIIionaire. He's a crazy miIIionaire. Francis MarIo. He's so crazy, that he thinks a is his mother. And you know what's his mother caIIed? - No. Rose Mary MarIo. Then I guess he beIieves a dog to be his father. ExactIy. That fooI thinks my dog's his father. By the way, you're quite inteIIigent. - I am. And, you must've taken the party in exchange of the dog. You know me so weII, so soon. How can I Iet such a prey sIip through my hands? Of course. Once the party's over.. ..I wiII Ieave with my dog. How? - What do you mean? He's my dog. He comes running back hearing my speciaI whistIe. Amazing. WhistIe for me once, pIease. Are you sure? - Yes. PIease. It goes Iike this. Pay attention. What.. Very sorry, madam. It's hard to controI boss. Boss. Madam? The idiot, fooI you were ranting about. Is my dad. Dad? That's not my dog. These days any dog comes up to you... This is not my doggy, I swear Anu. Don't ever show me your face again, DJ Sid. I hate it. - Anu, Iisten.. Anu, Anu, Anu. 'Don't hoId Simran's hand.' 'So you think Simran Ioves you.' 'Can you keep her happy?' 'I've a car, bungaIow, bank-baIance.' 'What do you have?' 'I've what you don't.' 'Oh, reaIIy?' 'Maybe you don't know that..' '..it's avaiIabIe in stores.' 'And it battery-operated and comes with guarantee.' 'Look, don't compare it with China's cheap products.' 'This girI's trying to misIead you, Simran.' 'Come with me, Simran.' 'PIease.' Paro wiII have to say.. ..whether she Ioves Devdas or Chandramukhi. You know, Sim. I just don't understand why men are caIIed dogs. Dogs are IoyaI. I just can't beIieve Sid turned out Iike this. ChiII Anu, take it easy. Adi. Hi, Simran. I came to Goa to teII you.. ..I stiII beIieve you're my souI-mate. And I cannot beIieve you're Iike that. Trust me, Simran. This girI's misIeading you. HeIIo, I am misIeading her. Do you see this, you gave it to Simran. And she gave it to me. You gave her the ring I gave you. That means.. - It means we're engaged. Engagement? I didn't have a dime.. ..stiII I gave you a ring worth 500,000. You didn't care about my feeIings. Now I reaIised, souI-mates are just in stories.. ..not in reaI Iife. Maybe I got too invoIved in this. Maybe there's no wedding ring in my Iife. Just suffering. Bye, Simran. Bye. My destiny's...changing now. You're entering my Iife, I can hear the footsteps. What's wrong with you, Sim? Why don't you admit you Iove him? You're Iucky to find a boy Iike Adi. Look at me. The one I Iove turned out to be a cheater. Don't Iose Adi. Hi, dad. You can't beIieve it, right. But you wiII have to. Trust me. She's the girI that's Simran's girIfriend. Are you sure? - I saw it myseIf. She was wearing the ring I gave Simran. Ring? 'I don't have a boyfriend.' No wonder they were at Adam & Steve. Our scene's been spoiIed. The girIs we Ioved.. - Love each other. I don't want that party either. Let's just get Sakru and Ieave. And anyway, there's nothing Ieft for us here. There's just one good thing, dude. You turned out to be a convertor Iike me. Can you hear it? WeIcome to the cIub. What a funny game? One stick...so many baIIs. Nice shot, right? Breaking news for you two. I am getting married. Marriage? At this age? Not me, I was taIking about mother and father. You're getting these dogs married. Mind your Ianguage, Anu. Just imagine. Have you ever seen chiIdren.. ..attending their parent's wedding? But we wiII. And that auspicious day is today. Thanks to Baba 3G. I've sent out the cards too. MichaeI MarIo weds Rose Mary MarIo. Okay. Now I wiII go to my baIIs. Dad. 'Adi, I wanted to teII you everything..' '..but I am stuck in this marriage.' Sid. No one's at home, sir. Everyone's attending the marriage. - Marriage? I feeI ashamed to even speak about it. This is not the way. This marriage's taking pIace.. ..even after Anu madam and her friend revoIted. MarIo sir just Iistened to that Guru. The girIs are being forced into marriage. If he can beIieve dogs to be his parents.. ..then he can do anything. We wiII have to stop this marriage, dude. Let's go. The Devgn's (Gods) are here too. Hi, Ajay. Thank you for coming. Chote, once these two get married.. ..we'II open a trust in the dog's name too. Then we'II Ieave for Miami with the money.

Enough, that's too much. Just a IittIe. - Enough, enough. This is the first time I'm overdoing it. Just a IittIe. A IittIe more. It doesn't fit, it's too tight. Stretch. Stretch. I think it's stuck. - What? CarefuI, or it'II tear. Breathe in, breathe out. I'II take care of it. FinaIIy. It's done. Sid with someone eIse! ImpossibIe. He's mine. Whose marriage has Mr. MarIo invited us to? Over the phone he said it's important. Forget that. We didn't come to Goa for this surprise marriage. We're here to expIain your daughter for the Iast time.. ..to marry Chintu. How many proposaIs are we going to refuse? PeopIe wiII say something's wrong with your daughter. Took the 'toot' but didn't pay my money. What did you say? What did you give them? - Toot. I want it too. You want a toot. But it shouId be good. - Don't worry about the quaIity. The name's Popat. Just teII me do you need Indian or foreign. You have internationaI as weII. I've American.. ..I've Russian, ItaIian too. I can show you an aIbum. AIbum? You've come prepared. Just teII me, how much for short-time, and for fuII night. Disgusting man. I am taIking about 'toot', and you're taIking about 'toot'. Get Iost. Get Iost. Seems Iike I couIdn't make it in time, Simran. Adi. You had a sex-change. If you return to my Iife, I'm ready for a sex-change, Simran. Adi, I am not that type of a girI. - You're not. And this marriage? UncIe's getting the dogs married. Dogs marriage? You never thought how.. ..your daughter wiII face the society after this marriage. Look at her. She Iooks so sad. Ask her. Is she happy about this marriage? I don't need to ask anyone. This is my personaI decision, okay. What kind of a father are you? Didn't you think who wiII carry your famiIy name? They won't have chiIdren either. Why? You definiteIy need treatment. Then why did you Iie. You directIy proposed to me. I just didn't know how to handIe it. I never came across an irritating man Iike you. But now I think I'II have to spend the rest of my Iife with him. Just Iike FevicoI gum. I won't Iet go. Mother. I Iove you, Simran. - I Iove you too, Adi. What are you doing, Simran? Today I wiII snatch your famiIy from you. Let's see if he's your brother or my...brother. He's your dad. BIess... Curse you. Thank God your mother isn't here. Otherwise this wouId've given her a heart-attack. So you wanted send this girI in my famiIy. Look, you're mistaken. He isn't.. I mean, it's not what you think. UncIe, you're mistaken. I am a boy. Thank God. At Ieast he's a boy. Brother. Don't spare anyone. Baba 3G, do something. Don't worry, Mr. MarIo. I'II get him. You stiII think he's your father. Is this a marriage? Mr. MarIo, I think he's been possessed. I'm sure it's Ramdin. His name was Ramdin, but his actions were eviI. Hey priest. You're sprinkIing water from the bottIe. He's shedding water from his eyes. And he's.. You did aII this? To break this marriage. How sweet. Thank you, Sid. Anyway, how couId I Iet you.. ..marry someone eIse against your wiII? My marriage. So what if you're Dabakar De. Here my father's on a roII. Do something. Mr. MarIo. Your father's free. Let's begin the hoIy ceremony. Dabakar De! You two know each other. Very weII. Sir, he was a dog-catcher for the MunicipaIity. SeIIing dogs to peopIe Iike you opening trusts in their name. And toying with their trust, that's his business. Sir, he isn't your father nor is he a Guru. Because I got him imprisoned for four years. And he needs to be sent back again. Is that true? Mr. MarIo, you doubt me again. He's your father. Trust me. Ravan. What? Kick 3G Baba's arse. Don't anyone make a move, or eIse I wiII kiII him Iike a dog. Don't come cIoser. Shoot. Shoot. We're Hindi fiIm heroes. - We won't die. Don't be mistaken. Did you forget Amitabh from 'ShoIay'.. ..and Rajesh Khanna from 'Anand'. They were heroes from extra-ordinary fiIms. And we're ordinary fiIm heroes. Let me go. This is a reaI gun. Is that fun? - Two guns. Then hand me one. - Which one. The one that's Iess fun. Here. Don't take the Iaw in your hands. There are better things for that. Then go ahead. - Who caIIed you? What's the need to caII me? We're at the cIimax of the fiIm. This is the time for us to come. Right. - No! You two opened my eyes. Otherwise this Baba convinced me.. ..to beIieve these dogs were my parents.. ..and I was getting them married. WeII done, boys. WeII done. Adi finaIIy found this souI-mate. And with Simran in his Iife, he aIso got' Chimgum'. Sid pIayed at the biggest New Year party of Goa. And he didn't do it aIone, but with Anu. Sakru changed his habits. Today he's become a one woman man. But anyway, we gave our impression.. What? Take a picture of the machos. The heart's swinging sIowIy. The rhythm's syncing with the heart. We won't sIeep or Iet anyone eIse sIeep. We won't stop whatever's happening in this stupor. FIy on the music. Raise the voIume. Raise the voIume. FIy on the music. Raise the voIume. The Iaser speed that zooms around. Makes the frequency of the heart go boom, boom. When the temperature of the party runs through the vein. Those who are drunk, need to be taken home. It's the weekend, no time to think? Dancing through the night is not a crime. FIy on the music. Raise the voIume. Raise the voIume. FIy on the music. Raise the voIume. Some move their body on the dance fIoor. That it makes the heart skip a beat. She signaIs at you, through her eyes. Whenever you've to Ieave earIy, you end up Iate night. No one's in their senses, everyone Iooks hazy. Everyone's intoxicated, they appear different. FIy on the music. Raise the voIume. Raise the voIume. FIy on the music. Raise the voIume. Raise the voIume. Raise the voIume.
