Two, I'm not a rapist or a serial killer. - Well, what makes you so sure I'm not a rapist? - Oh. Are you saying you wanna rape me? - Would you like it? - I like to live on the edge, too. Okay, I'll tell you what. I'll give you your camera back even though you illegally took pictures of me. But, then you have to come for a coffee with me. - Um, I don't have time for coffee.

I didn't wanna come back. - Why not? Paris is the most beautiful city in the world. - [Man] Yeah, that's what Americans say. - [Woman] That's what everyone says. (crackling) - [Man] So? Where are you from? - [Woman] What? America. - [Man] That's vague. I meant where as in where are you parents right now? - I have no idea where my parents are. - [Man] What do you mean? - I mean they could be in the kitchen or the living room or the bedroom. I mean, they could be dead. - Where you going? - Shower. - End of the hallway. Oh, hey. - Hey, can I borrow a t-shirt and underwear? I left all my stuff at a cafe somewhere. - You what? Okay, sure. - What are you reading? - Um, I'm reading this really interesting book called 'War'. - What's it about? - Um, right now, I'm reading this chapter about fear, you know. And, about how, for instance, the snipers, they have to perform well under pressure, you know. - [Woman] Wow, that sounds really interesting. - Yeah. It is really interesting. And then, there's this other chapter about... So? Do you have a place to stay for the night? You can stay here if you want. - Thanks. - You're really hungry, aren't you? So, you're gonna have to pick up your stuff at some point. - It's fine, I can do that tomorrow. - Yeah. You're not too worried about things, are you? (slow music) Hey. - Hey. - You awake? - Yes. - What's your name? - Alessia. You? - Florent. - What? - Florent. - Goodnight. - Goodnight. - So, are you on vacation? - Not really. - What do you mean, not really? And, are you a student? - Not anymore. - What do you do? - She's a photographer. - That's not true. - [Florent] I think you are. - Did you make money with photography? - So, what's there to see today? - Um, I don't know. What do you wanna see? - Maybe you should take her to Normandie. - [Florent] That's kinda nice actually. - [Alessia] I gotta go. - Where you going? Hey, wait. (laid-back music) Hey. Can you wait. Wait. Wait, where you going? Hey. Are you crying? - I'm not crying. - 'Kay, what's wrong with you? - Nothing. - Hey, look. He's my best friend and he doesn't know you, alright. You know he's just a student, thinks he's gonna change the world and he knows - He doesn't know shit about me. Mother fuck. - Of course he doesn't know shit about you. I don't know shit about you. You never say anything. You never answer my questions. - I have more important shit to do. Sit there. While he's talking about me - [Florent] Really? in French. - [Florent] Really, like what? More important things to do. - Like what? See again, you're not answering my questions. Wait. Wait. Listen, listen to me, okay. This guy's my best friend and you're being very rude, okay. I've been very kind to you. This is very disrespectful. So, stop it right now. - You've been kind to me? - Yes. - Why? 'Cause you let me sleep at your house and I don't let you fuck me? - What are you talking about? You're crazy. I didn't even try anything, did I? - But, that's what you want, isn't it? A cute American girl. Lost by herself in Paris. You invite her over. - You're not lost by yourself in Paris. You're the one who came up to me. - Wrong again. You came up to me. - No, you're taking hundreds of pictures of me but that's not even the fucking point, okay. - Fine, you want me to leave? - [Florent] Shut your mouth. - I'll leave. - Shut your fucking mouth, okay. Fucking crazy. - Why would you let me in then, if you don't know me and you don't wanna fuck me? - I didn't say I didn't want to, I said I didn't try. - See, there. - Don't push me. - I knew it. - Don't fucking push me. (screaming) (upbeat music) (laid-back music) (upbeat music) (funky music) (laughing) (laughing) Come. (laughing) - Look, I'm sorry about earlier. I was just upset and - Let me show you something. Look. Quiet, peaceful. (mumbling) - I love that movie. - Look, The Eiffel Tower. - [Alessia] So amazing. - You know, it used to be lit up all night. They changed it. - Why? - [Florent] 'Cause the world is crazy. What? - Your breath stinks. - So does yours. - Hello? Flo?. (bell ringing) (bell ringing) - Well, I'm the one who's sorry 'cause I'm keeping the camera. - Fine. - Hey, wait. Where you going? - Where are you right now? Neither here nor there. - What did you say? Hey. Hey. Hey, wait. - Hey. - What's up? - Nothing, do you ever sleep? - What are you talking about? It's already one. - Shit, really? Hey, can we go some place? I wanna see other parts of France. - Okay. We can drive somewhere. Hello. Okay. - Girlfriend? (laughing) (speaking French) American. (laughing) - Ready? - I was born ready. (upbeat music) So where are we going? - Oh, we're going to Deauville. It's in Normandie, you know in the north of France. It's a small beach town. My parents have a house there so we have a place to stay. And, that's where the Americans came to save the world. - You're so lucky. - I'm lucky? Why, 'cause you're sitting in the car? - That and you live in a beautiful apartment in Paris, your parents have houses all over the place, nice cars. You don't think you're lucky? - No, I'm lucky. You're right, I'm a lucky guy. - Yeah. Enjoy it. - You really wanna know what I think? - [Alessia] Of course. - You know how we, in France, who live in a country that has an amazing history, right. Amazing philosophers and artists, writers and even politicians, you know, human rights, the French new wave and cinema or French cuisine, French baguette, wine and cheese. I feel like we live in a place that has a better past than future. It's like we're born at the wrong time, you know. It's really frustrating. - Poor thing. - Come on, you can't understand, you're an American. - No, I do. But, it's the same everywhere. I mean, look at the United States. Everyone's saying the American is presently dead. - [Florent] Come on, you can do whatever you want in America. - [Alessia] No, America runs on money and oil and that's it. - [Florent] I see, so you're one of those then? - [Alessia] One of what? - [Florent] Anti-globalization. Communists, vegan, lesbian activist. You have tattoos all over your butt. - Seriously though. Americans don't care about art or philosophy. They don't know how to live. They work 60 hour weeks until finally they retire and they never leave the country. And, there's a category for everything. Like if I say occupy wallstreet then I'm a communist lesbian, like you said. Like, people are robots. If you're Black or gay or Asian or Jewish or rich or poor than you should behave like this or like that. But, what if you don't fit into their categories, their tiny little boxes? And, what if you don't want Sam or Joe at Starbucks to ask you a thousand times, "How are you doing today, ma'am?" 'Cause you're pissed as fuck. You're having a shitty day. In Texas, they're like, "oh hey, come around over here, "Cynthia can help you. "Cynthia can you check her out, please? "Can you run her up?" - I guess the grass is always greener, huh? - I love it. Are the French immune to lung cancer? I see French people drinking all the time. - [Florent] Yeah. - But, like only the homeless people get drunk. Starbucks coffee sucks. (people talking) Ew. Sand. - [Voiceover] Want some wine, you want? You want some wine? - Please. Thank you. Cheers. Cheers. - [Florent] Can you pass the bread, please? Oh yeah, I forgot to tell you but Marion doesn't speak English at all. - Of course, I can speak English. - You're sounding fine to me. - What did she say? - [Florent] See, told you. - So, where are we? - In Deauville. And, you know what. This is the place where they wrote (speaking French). - [Florent] You know where the Americans landed during World War II, like I told you before. - Right here? - No. - [Florent] No, it's close to here. There's a memorial. If you want, we can go, it's pretty nice. I can take you. - [Alessia] Wow, I'd love to see that. - What are you doing? What are you doing? - [Florent] Yeah, she does that all the time. - No, no, wait, wait, stop, stop, stop. What are you doing? No, please stop. - Come on, you're beautiful. - [Marion] No, I'm not beautiful at all. I will be very, very beautiful with this. - [Florent] Very beautiful, - [Alessia] Yes. Not sure. - I love the lipstick. Very glamorous. - Let me get ready. (laughing) What? - Get ready. What? - [Marion] God. - Very glamorous. - [Marion] Yeah? - Yeah. Wow. Yeah, come on. - Cheese. Show me a picture. I want to see one. Just show me one. - No. - [Woman] I just want to see. - [Alessia] No. Why no, it's me, you have to. You have to. - [Alessia] No. Show me just one. - No, seriously. - [Florent] Hey, where you going? - I'm just gonna go for a walk. - [Florent] Should I come with you? - [Alessia] No, it's okay. I'm just gonna walk around a little bit. - [Florent] Walk around? - Yeah, like, take some pictures. You guys catch up. I'll be back soon. 'Kay. - Bye. - Wow. This all looks so delicious. I can eat these? - [Marion] Yeah. - [Florent] Of course. - So, did you also go to the American school? - Me? no. Normal school. Public school for normal people. - [Alessia] So, how did you guys meet? - From long time. - We went to preschool together. - [Alessia] Really? - [Florent] Yeah. - I don't have any friends from preschool. So, tell me something about Florent that he would never tell me himself. - He's very nice. He's very generous. He loves his friends. But, if you do something in his back, he just stops speaking with you forever. - Oh, really? - And, he's also very romantic. - That's not true. I don't know why she's saying this, that's not true. - [Alessia] That's so sweet. I don't know why she's saying this. - [Alessia] Okay, tell me more. Tell me more. - Oh, I have us a funny story about him. Okay. - [Alessia] Yes, yes. Just what I want. - [Marion] We went to Iceland. - Can't believe you're gonna tell this story. - [Alessia] Thanks. - Especially to see whales. But, it just had (speaking French). - What, what? (speaking French) - A total what? - [Florent] Had a stiff neck. - [Marion] Okay, because the night before, he was too drunk to go to his bed so he just slept on the floor like this. So, when we saw a whale, he just couldn't see it. So, it was so funny because in four days he never saw a single whale. - You went all the way to Ireland and you didn't see a single whale? - Iceland, not Ireland. - Same thing. - I don't know why she's saying all this. She's crazy, seriously. - 'Cause I love him very much. So, now your turn. Tell us something about you. What are you doing here? - Um. Okay. Well, um, I'm from Texas. I'm 23 years old. And, I just studied random stuff in the US. - What is random stuff? - [Alessia] It's just you make up your own major. - Okay. And? - And. And. Oh, my mother just died. - I'm sorry, I didn't know. You never said anything. - Yeah, it was her dream to come to France and she never did so, here I am. - I'm sorry. - Yeah, we weren't that close. It's okay. - Still, she's your mom. - [Florent] Should we drink something, maybe? So, you like oysters or shrimps better? - The shrimp. - [Alessia] So, what's there to do in Deauville? - Nothing. - Resting. - [Marion] I don't know. When do you go back to US? - I'm not sure. Maybe I'll stay. - [Marion] You don't want to see your family? - [Alessia] Not really. This is good. - Eat more, you're not eating anything. - [Alessia] Cheers. - Cheers. - Cheers. - Cheers. - Please stop staring like this? - That waiter's really cute. - I was thinking the same. - We should invite him over here. - [Florent] Come on, he's working. - So. - So, maybe I should go be the waiter and then he could come and sit with you guys, if that's what you want. - And, he's very jealous, too. - [Florent] That's not true. (laughing) - Come on, drink it up. - What is this? - Just let it be. (coughing) - This is so nice. - What? - Just do it. - No, no, no, no, no, no, no. He wants us to leave. - Do you want me to do it? - [Marion] No. - Come on girls, listen, poor guy. He probably just wants to go home to his wife, I'm sure. You know, some girl he met in high school when she like 16 and he got her pregnant. - You really have imagination. - That's what they do on the country side, right? - You should write a book. - Yes. That's how I always tell him. - That's what I should do. I should be a writer. - I would read it. - [Florent] Okay. - [Alessia] Do it. - That's it. And then, you can take pictures, you know, to promote the book. How do you call this? The cover of my book. - And, what do I do? (laughing) - You pose for the cover. - That's it? - No, no, no, because, you know, you like talking so fucking much all the time. I know you should be a how do you say this? My... - Bitch? (laughing) - You can be my agent. - Book launch parties. - You should sit with us. - Yes. - No, babe, it's okay, he wants go home, we're gonna leave. - Come, one drink. - Don't worry. - [Alessia] Have a drink, have one drink, okay? - Okay. - No, but go home. - [Waiter] I'll be right back. - [Alessia] Everybody speaks English here. (laughing) - Yeah. - I studied in Australia for a year. - Good for you. - Aussie, aussie, aussie. Australia. - You guys want? - Yes. - No, no, no, no, no, no, no. - [Marion] Stop. - [Florent] My God. - More, more, more. - [Waiter] More? - Yeah, yeah, to the top. Yes. - Just a tiny little bit for me. - All the way. - [Florent] That's enough. That's, no, I can't drink this. - You of all people. - I can't. - Cheers y'all. - Cheers. Okay. - So, what's your story? - I can't believe you just broke the glass. - [Waiter] My story. That's really good news. - No thanks, I don't like it. - Sorry, I didn't mean to. I don't know. Who am I? - No, no, no, no, we don't wanna know who you are. We want you to tell us a story about your life. - A story about my life. I don't know. Let's start at the beginning. So, my name is Thomas, what's you name? - Alessia. - [Thomas] And, you? - Flo. - Marion. - Marion, okay. So, my name is Thomas and I'm a student. - [Florent] Student, lucky. - [Alessia] I know. - Art history. - I got that. - Really, look at you. French is improving all of a sudden. - And, you, what's your story? Where are you from? You American? - Unfortunately. - [Florent] Smart one, too, huh. It's not just a face. - [Thomas] Why unfortunately? - Because there's nothing to do there. There's, it's full of a - Full of what? Come on, there is nothing to do here. - Yes. - That's so true. There's nothing to do here. - [Alessia] No, what about that thing, the museum you talked about. The World War II - Museum. - [Alessia] Yeah, yeah, that's it. See. - Yes. - What - He will come with us to the museum. - Oh yeah? - [Marion] Yeah. - Okay. - What? - But she goes so (laughing) - He will come with us to the museum. - Really? (laughing) - Okay guys. - What? - My French isn't that good yet. - They're just talking about some, what are you guys talking about? Oh, really? - Yeah. - Good for you. - Thank you. - Yeah, bullshit. - Oh, I've done those. - Yeah, people don't want to work anymore. This is what our problem is. Now, we are old and we understand that all is over. - I don't think this is a problem. - Guys. We're understanding that we're gonna die. (laughing) - [Florent] We're understanding. - [Marion] We're going to die. Yes, we're going to die. - [Alessia] We all are. He didn't like that, did he? - That was cute. - I love this music. Let's dance. Come on, I want to dance. Okay. I want to dance. - No, no, no. No. No, seriously, stop pushing me. My God. (laid-back music) k One day baby we'll be old k Oh baby we'll be old k Think of all the stories that we could've told k One day baby we'll be old k Oh baby we'll be old k Think of all the stories that we could've told k One day baby we'll be old k Oh baby we'll be old k Think of all the stories that we could've told k One day baby we'll be old k Oh baby we'll be old k Think of all the stories that we could've told k One day baby we'll be old k Oh baby we'll be old k Think of all the stories that we could've told k One day baby we'll be old k Oh baby we'll be old k Think of all the stories that we could've told k One day baby we'll be old k Oh baby we'll be old k Oh baby we'll be old k One day baby we'll be old k Oh baby we'll be old k Think of all the stories that we could've told k One day baby we'll be old k Oh baby we'll be old k Oh baby we'll be old k Oh baby we'll be old (screaming) k One day baby we'll be old k Oh baby we'll be old k Think of all the stories that we could've told k One day baby we'll be old k Oh baby we'll be old k Think of all the stories that we could've told k One day baby we'll be old k Oh baby we'll be old k Oh baby we'll be old k Oh baby we'll be k One day baby we'll be old k Oh baby we'll be old k Think of all the stories that we could've told k One day baby we'll be old k Oh baby we'll be old k And think of all the stories that we could've told k - The traffic has jammed. - Okay, okay, okay, so. When was the last time you had sex? - Are you talking to me? - Yeah. You, everybody, Flo, I know, so. - [Florent] Really? - Yeah. - [Florent] I don't know why she's saying this. - Really? So, when was it? - Um, few weeks ago. - Days. - Really? - Why me, okay? What about you then? - With a guy or a girl? - Oh, interesting. - Wait, you really had sex with a girl? - Of course. What? - Nothing. It's normal, you know. You kiss a girl everyday. - Come on, you really never tried it? - No. No, but I want to. - Really? - Maybe I could help you with that. - So, what about you Marion? So? - Five months. - What? - What? - Five months? - What, it's not so long. - I had sex last week. - Last week. - [Marion] But, you're a guy. - [Thomas] And? - It's - double standards. - Oh, congratulations, you win. - No. - What? What? - Um, they want us to kiss. - You and me? - [Marion] They want to see us. - Okay. What do we get in exchange? - Yeah, what do we get? - You get the experience you've always wanted, right. Come on, you just said so. And, you. - How bout you two kiss and then we kiss. - Yeah. - [Florent] Us? - Yeah. You kiss her and then I kiss Alessia. - Oh, okay, so you kiss her. - [Marion] No. - [Alessia] She meant him. - So? - No, no. - Okay. - Okay? - Come on, just a kiss. - [Alessia] Yeah. - But, a real kiss or else it doesn't count. - [Florent] You guys are such babies, seriously. - Oh yeah, we're the babies. - Yeah. So? - Okay. - Okay. - [Florent] Okay. - Okay. - [Alessia] Alright, then. Go, go, go. - But, then, you're turn. - My parents see what's going on in their house? On their bed? - Who cares, their not here. - [Florent] Alright. - They're gonna do it. Come on. - That's nothing. - Okay, it's fine, your turn. - She's right, do not pretend to be a prude. - I'm not a prude. - Come on, a real kiss. Okay, I guess you don't. - No, no, no, no, no, no. - [Florent] Come on. (everyone speaking) - Do it. Yeah, come on guys. You can't screw me over. - Oh my God. Unbelievable, Florent kissed him. - Yeah. - [Marion] I just can't believe Florent kissed him. - [Thomas] Now, your turn. - [Florent] Okay, your turn, your turn. - Okay. (soft rock music) (crunching) (crunching) (chewing) (jingling) (crunching) (jingling) (sipping) So, are we going to that museum? - Oh yeah, yeah. Forgot about that. (cheerful music) - [Thomas] This is real. - [Florent] It's real? - [Thomas] Yeah. - [Alessia] It's not a model? - [Thomas] No. - 45. - This is real? - Yeah. Everything's real. - Can you imagine, tens of thousands of men, literally in hell, at the second they step out of the boat, they were just avoiding thousands of bullets, flying right, left and center and some of them dying, just like that. (puckering) (puckering) (happy music) - Like, you know how we keep saying we're bored with life? We don't know what we're gonna do next year. Well, by the time these soldiers were pretty much our age, they had something to do. Something important. - So, for you, war is a good thing? - That's not what I said. - Well, I guess war was a good thing for the Americans to do at that point, right? - No, no, no, that's not what she's saying. Go fight. - I'm just saying that I wish I had a purpose in my life. - That's ridiculous. So for you, you prefer to be, like one of the thousands of 22 years old who died because of the government? - Just don't go in Iraq. - I didn't say I wanted to go to war or that I think war is a good thing. Don't you think I think war in Iraq was bullshit driven by oil and money? - No, you're just saying that it's good because this people have a purpose in their lives. But, come on, they didn't choose it. This is the government who tells them that they need to fight for something bigger or for liberty, whatever. This is not the real purpose these people die. - [Alessia] You're not getting my point. - I'm totally getting your point. - Les American, what? If you're gonna say it, use English so I can answer you. - I just said, you're a real American, that's it. - [Alessia] Well, you should be grateful because according to what we just saw it's because of stupid Americans that we even live in this boring town. - [Thomas] For sure, you're a stupid American. - [Florent] Hey guys, guys. Can you calm down for a sec? - Well, I'm just saying that maybe being given a purpose, even if it's fake, even if it means dying when you're 22 as a hero, maybe this makes you happier in life if you believe it. - You know what, why don't you go to the army? Why? - Actually, you know what, that's true. If you care about it so much, you're gonna ruin our day over this. - I don't care about war. It's not my purpose, it's just a purpose. God, maybe I should speak slower so you can understand me better. - Or, maybe if you were able to speak French, we could understand you better. - Well. Hey. What'd you just say? You're crazy, aren't you? - Oh, I'm crazy? You're the one who suspiciously speaks English with no accent. You stole my camera and you won't give it back until I go some place with you. And, you keep following me. - Well, okay. Yes. I guess you could see it this way. Wait. (somber music) - You know what? We should get married. - What? - Yeah, that way, you can come to the US and stay and I can make a political statement. - You mean that way, you go jail and I get deported from the US permanently and I can't re-enter ever. - Come on, people do it all the time. - Very good plan. - Gay people can't get married in the US so I'm gonna use my right to make a point. - You're mixing everything up right now. - No, I'm not. Think about it. - You want me to think about it, really? - [Alessia] Yeah. - [Flroent] Okay. And so, we get married and then what happens when you fall in love with someone else and you can't get married to that person 'cause you're already married to me? - Yes, I can, we can get a divorce. (seagulls squawking) You know, my mom always dreamed of coming to France. Of seeing the streets of Paris. She never did. I mean, I came. I saw Paris. And, she never had the guts to come. And, now she can't. - Oh. Come here. You know, that's also why them things don't work. - Where you going? - [Florent] Home. - Already? - [Florent] Yeah. (speaking French) k And my mind k In the far away here and now k I've become in control somehow k And I never lose my wallet k Because I k Will be the picture of perception k Never fucking up anything k And I'll be a good defensive driver k And it's funny how I imagined k That I would be that person now k But it does not seemed to have happened k Maybe I've just forgotten how k To speak k And I'll never be the person k That I thought I'd be k And my mind k When I'm old I am beautiful k Planting tulips and vegetables k Which I will mindfully watch over k Not like me now k I'm so busy with everything k That I don't know that anything k But I'm sure I'll look when I am older k And it's funny how I imagine k That I could be that person now k - What's up sunshine? - Hey. Do you see my lighter anywhere? - No. (buzzing) - Can we go some place, I need to get outta here. - Okay. Let me get dolled up. (buzzing) - Hey, it's Marion. Hello. She's really pissed that we didn't say bye. Thomas doesn't wanna see her anymore. - So mean. (laid-back music) - [Florent] So? My parents are coming back. In a few days. What are you gonna do? - I don't know. - [Florent] Are you gonna go back home? (relaxing music) - Put your hand on my leg. Like I'm yours. This city is so amazing. - [Florent] Be careful, be careful. - Come on. - I don't like this. - You're so straight-laced. I'm tired. - [Florent] Wanna sit? - Yeah. There's bird shit. You know, think you look really good. You're like one of those guys that looks good with makeup. Can I try something? - If you want. - Oh, you're the best. - So, do you like Paris? - Are you kidding? I love Paris. - Really? - I could see myself living here. - Really? - [Alessia] Really. - So you need to get a place. - Your hair's so thick. It's crazy. - [Florent] Alessia. Right, I need to get a place. - I can help you with that. - Right. - Alessia. - [Alessia] Right. - Is that all you can say, right? - [Alessia] What do you want me to say? Left? - No. - How 'bout you coming to The States? - Come on, we've been through this. I can't go to The States. I don't have a Visa for The States. - I don't have a Visa for here. - Yeah, right. If we get married then you could stay. You're the one who said it. Don't give me that look. - Come on, I was upset. - Oh, you were upset. - [Alessia] Yeah. - You must really think I'm an idiot, huh? So what now, you're just gonna go home? - I didn't say I was gonna go home. - What did you say? - I didn't say I was gonna go home. What are you doing? Ouch. - Ow. Ow. - [Alessia] I'm sorry. - [Florent] That really hurt. - I'm sorry. Come here. Come here. - Okay, here's your camera. Take it. Where you rushing to anyway? - I'm not rushing. I'm exploring. - Well, actually, I am from here. So, I could show you around. (nostalgic music)
