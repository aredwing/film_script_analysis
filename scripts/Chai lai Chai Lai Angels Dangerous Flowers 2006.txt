Want some coffee? - No, thanks. - Coffee? - No, thanks. Coffee? No, thanks. Do you remember this pipe? This is for you, Daddy. Wow! Thank you, dear. It's very beautiful. Thank you, dear. It belongs to my father. Sorry. Using telephone is not allowed on the plane. I know. Yes, I remember. How could I forget your birthday, Gud? Really? All right. I gotta get back to work now. You are with that girl, right? Here. Why don't you talk to your daddy? Hello. Papa... It's me, Miki. - Are you all right? - Papa! Miki! Don't hurt my daughter! You coffee? I don't fucking want it! Tell me. Where you keep it or I'll kill your daughter. Give it back to your father. Papa! I'm not a buffalo. I know a buffalo! Come here. You midget! Come here. No. I don't know anything at all. I'm a just passenger. I'm here with my husband. I saw people fighting and just want to be nosey. I somehow got hit. I don't know anything. You long-tongued ghost! Say 'I don't know' again. I don't know. Don't know, right? You bitch. Oops! I'm sorry, Mommy. Miki! I'm sorry. You all are useless. I told you to get important stuff, but you're back with a stupid box. Why did you bring me a picture of a kid? You too! King Kong. I told you to bring that girl. And where is she now? She's in the picture, boss. See? In the picture? How about the upcoming auction? The customers have already placed the order. How can we deliver them the goods? Chai Lais always meddle in our business. Those bimbos again? Yes, sir. It nearly cost me my life to get this box from the Japanese. Boss... Besides the Chai Lais, Have you ever noticed that... we usually make mistakes in our work? You'll know the answer when you look out there. National Police Bureau I've seen it for a long time. Burn it! Are you sure? You mean the whole bureau? Still in the meeting? When you're done, I need to talk to you. I think I know how we could get that stuff. International Police Headquarters Have you found out where... Dragon and his gang are having the auction? We have been tracking on them. I think we should get something soon. How about you two? I've also heard about their upcoming auction. Tell you what. If I have any progress, I'll let you know. By the way, on my flight back home, I met someone. She's very lovely. Flight attendant or passenger? A flight attendant. Seriously I've never seen a girl this charming in my life. Her flat nose is so adorable! Chai Lai Headquarters It's okay to fail on your first mission. Next time don't let me down, Rose. You should think carefully, hold your temper. Be patient and prudent with everything you do. Experience will teach you to solve problems. Fortunately, they couldn't get Miki-san. Otherwise, you all are in deep shit. She is the one who holds the secret of the Andaman Pearl. I want you to do your best to protect her. Don't let her out of your sight. Especially when she's in school... Lotus will be disguised as a teacher. Got it. Teacher? What does it mean? Blackboard, I guess! The one who teaches students! Spadix, You will be a Tuk-Tuk driver guarding around school. Can't I drive a Ferrari instead, boss? We don't have the budget. Let's take a Tuk-Tuk. Rose will be a stall seller in front of the school. How could a high-society girl like me be a vendor? Oh! You sweetest thing! All right. It's up to you. You can be anything you like, just stay at that post. All right. So, Pouy-sian, you'll disguise as a food vendor. Yes, sir. Hibiscus, With your hillbilly face, you're perfect for being a maid. What! A maid? Can't you use my beauty to do something else? What did she just say? Boss, if you don't understand, nobody will. No, I don't. All right. Shut up. You are a maid. Call it a servant or a nanny, if you like. - Practically, they're the same. - Yes, sir. - Get to the mission! - What? The mission! All right. I'll take a good care of it. Boiled peanuts and sweet potatoes! Pouy-sian. Pouy-sian. School front is clear. Rose calls Spadix. Rose calls Spadix. Rose who? It's me, the beautiful Rose. I see. And how's your status? You can always count on me. Everything is fine. Good to hear that. So I can finish my makeup. Who cares about your makeup? Geez! My face is so oily. Hey! Who's got a mustache? Nobody else is here. Whoa! It's me! Here they come. How is she doing? She's always a good girl. Very good girl. Hey! Catch that girl. Hey, Hibiscus! Hey! Come on. Go. Here. Come on. Hold her! Hey! Hey, let go. Hey! Quick! Son of a bitch... How dare you kick my face? No! Don't shoot! Don't shoot! Don't shoot. Get up! Hurry! Come on. Let me go! Come on! Get in! Let me go. No! Pouy-sian! Don't shoot them. Don't shoot! Oh shit! Pouy-sian! Give me your hand, Pouy-sian. Hold it tightly. Give me your hand. Come on. Give me your hand. Come on. Give me your hand. Come on. The truck is coming towards us! Rose, get closer. You chase them from the back. I'll cut in on their car. Lotus, try to threaten them with your gun. Lotus. Lotus. - Stop. - What next? Don't let them get away. Hit it! Let me go. No. Don't shoot. No. Don't shoot. Pouy-sian! Rose! Miki-san. Hibiscus! Hold on. Hold tightly. Hibiscus... Jump! Come on. I got you. Jump, Hibiscus. Come on. Jump. Don't block my view. I can't see the road. Watch out! No. Get down to the seat. Come on. Come on. Down here. Down here. Too far. Come on. I got you. I got you. Quick. No! No! You don't know who you're messing with! Don't step on me. It's dirty. Grab her! Hang on, Miki-san. Miki-san! Hurry up! Jump! Lotus. Stop! Stop. Stop right there! What the heck? I'm in a hurry. I'm in a hurry, too! Sorry. Sorry. Let's go! Stay still. You're such a pain in the ass! Moron! What was that kick for? I'm sorry, man. What the hell are you doing? You wimpy asses can't handle even a little kid? Get up! Go get her. Child, Don't you love your mommy? Your mommy is here too. Just tell me the secret. No, I don't. Fine. Take her mommy out here. Yes, sir. How do I look? Put more makeup on, you'll look like a zombie! I think that's okay. Seems hurt. Show me how you hurt. Come on. Pretend to be sad. Looks hurt. That's it. Ms. Mei Ling, you're awesome. The boss wants to see you, Ms. Mei Ling. We're all set. Fight! Miki... Just tell him where your daddy's treasure is. No, I don't. Please tell him. No, I don't. Tell him. Are you telling me or not? No. Not telling me, right? If you don't tell us... Are you telling now? No. You're not telling? Don't hurt my mommy! Come here. Don't you care for your mother anymore? Tell me where it is! Miki... Please tell him. Please tell him. Please tell him. No. Please tell him. No. Take this kid and lock her in the room. Not telling me, right? Help me. - Help me - Miki. Help me. Help me. Please tell him. Why it's so difficult to get her to spill the beans? I want to go to the spa. Be patient. I'll have somebody take you to the spa, okay? What is it? You can't protect even a little kid. How could you do anything else? Well, Boss, this is our plan, sending a cub into a cave. A cub into a cave? I've never heard of it. What are you up to? It's a part of our plan, boss. We just let them capture Miki on purpose. No. It won't work. Keep an eye on Mei Ling and Dragon. I'm informed that they're working together. Do you know Miki is just a stepdaughter of Mei Ling? How could I be your boss if I don't know about this? We have a plan. A plan? What plan? A plan called "Tricking a snake into the hole". Tricking a snake into the hole? Okay. Get that snake into your hole. Miki... Use what I taught you only when necessary Don't use it to harm innocent people. If something happens to me, you must obey your stepmother. Even if she's not your real mother. I want you to love her just like I do. More importantly, Miki, you must protect the Andaman Pearl. Because it's very crucial for poising the ocean. Don't let anyone take it from the nature. If it loses all energy, our world will be in jeopardy. Be a good girl! I love you, sweetie. If you slap my face like that again, I'll rip your face apart! I do what master Dragon tells me. If I didn't slap you, nobody would believe us. Can you lower your voice? Everyone can hear what you're saying. Nobody is going to hear us. Did you two hear what we just said? No, Madam. Very nice. That means we've already talked quietly. I heard it with my two ears! Two snakes are clawing ahead. The third one is about to get into the hole. What is going into the hole? Nothing. The snake is getting into the hole. Copy that. Pouy-sian. Pouy-sian. Where're you going, wretched liar? Just been thinking about you. You really miss me? Very much! Then talk to my bodyguard. But I want to talk to you! Kill them. Hey! Here they come! You slutty bitch. What a stupid faggot! What a humongous bitch! Bring me up. - Thank you. - You're welcome. Kill them. Come on. Put the towel for me. Are you going to beset me? Catch me if you can... Chai Lai! Where're you going? Come back here. Nice to see you again, midget. Surprise! Ogre! How could an ogre be this gorgeous? Why don't you shoot me instead? As you wish! Catch him. Thanks a lot. No! Spadix. No! Spadix. No. We can't kill him before we know where Miki is. Told ya... Don't get on my nerves. Look! He's not dead yet. Let's get him! Come on. Hurry up. Damn. King Kong, get in. Don't let him get away. Get him! Those damn Chai Lais are really getting more aggravating. Not only aggravating, But they are actually destructive. Don't worry about it, boss. I've hired the five-nation bounty hunters to slay them off. Good! Take them out! Hello. Earth, is that you? This is me. Hold on a second. Wait! Wait! Where are you going, Rose? I'm going to Gud's birthday. Gotta go now. How do I look? Fabulous. - Hold on. Hold on. - What? Have a happy time! That's for sure. See ya. Rose. You almost missed my birthday. But I always make it, don't I? Happy Birthday. Will you marry me? What's wrong? I can't breathe. I'm going to die. What? If I can't marry you. Will you marry me? Rose, I've just got a job. Really? What kind of job? Working in a bank. My salary is up to 8000 baht. Really? I can take care of you from now. I promise. I'll take care of you. Well, how is your job coming along? It's kind of busy. What kind of job you do? You never told me. One day you'll see. Rose. Are you going to marry me? Yes. I should get going. Oh, Gud. What? Happy Birthday. Thank you. I really gotta go. Good night. I'll get married! From outside, we're just ordinary women ...that can be found everywhere. We also have romantic feeling. What makes us different is something inside that others can't see. Love... Love... Love I never told anyone. Hiding... Hiding... Hiding We can't tell you that we're Chai Lai. Frisky... mighty... and sexy like no others. Tender... Fragile... everything... you name it. Whoever wanna try us... let me warn you first... We're extraordinary, if you dare to try. What's wrong? You were dancing like a crazy pony! Why did you turn it off? I'm getting in a mood. Still haven't told us. I'll get married soon. Gud has just proposed to me. Are you sure that he really loves you? Absolutely! He loves me and I love him. We love each other. Yuck! Talking about man always gets Lotus down. Unlike me... I think I'll quit being Chai Lai. Are you sure? Gud! Get up! Gud! Let him go! Didn't you hear me? Do you remember my eye? You're so much in love, right? Gud! Hang in there. Rose, take Gud out of here! Where is Hibiscus? Pouy-sian, come with me. They are too many. This way. Hibiscus, stop being a greedy pig. They're coming to get us. Who? - Dragon's henchmen! - What? Come on. Quick. What are you looking for? Weapons. Let's go! It's not time to eat. Jump! Jump! Gud... climb down into the pool. I'll be right there. Easy. Easy. Here we are. All right. Sit here. Meow! Shit! Should we finish them off now, boss? No, not yet. We have to wait. Get down! Gud... Gud... You've got to be strong! Rose. You idiot, Rose! Your time has come. Kill her! Lotus. I think I'd better go help Rose. I'm kind of worried about her. All right, you should be careful. I'll take care of the rest. Okay. Gud, hide yourself now. Go! It's very dangerous here. Gud Gud Gud Come on! Get angry! Get angry now! How dare you grope my ass? It makes me angry. Hey, negro. Why is it so slippery? What stinky breath! You don't know who you're messing with. Spadix Spadix. Gud. Spadix. Help me! Rose. Spadix. Pouy-sian. Pouy-sian. Let's go! Where are you bimbos going? Cage them! You think you're so tough, right? This time you all will be dead like rats. The dead one is you! Oh yeah? So why don't you come out? Come closer and I'll kick your ass. Kathleen Gud. Hibiscus? Where is Hibiscus? Hibiscus. Hibiscus. Turn left... Turn left. Turn left... Turn left. You're all going to die! Turn left. Shoot them! Shoot! Shoot! Is she going to miss like last time? I hope not. Yes! That's it. Oh! It was close. I knew it. She missed again. Hibiscus. Turn left... Turn left. Shoot them! Shoot them! Shoot them! Shoot them! Go straight ahead. Stop. Turn the barrel to right... right and shoot! Right. Right. Turn the barrel to right... right and shoot! Come on. Shoot then. Come on. Come on. Shoot them. I know how we can get out of here. Grope my ass. Grope my ass. Not you! Him! Him! Gud, touch her ass. Touch it. Touch it. Shit! You touch my boobs! Stop. Stop. Stop. Come on. Come on. Hurry. Get him. Come on. Gud. Gud. Gud. Gud. Look. This is my masterpiece. Who is he? Rose's boyfriend. You can't be that stupid. To lure tigers out of the cave, we got to have some baits. And he's our bait. Are you getting smart now, boss? And who the hell is this freak? It's my last move. Drag him out here. Kathleen Cut his finger off. Yes, madam. His finger not mine! I'm sorry, madam. I'm right here. This is what you called "smart", King Kong? Open the door. Gud! What's wrong? I had a nightmare. You must be very worried about Gud. He'll be fine. Believe me. Rose... Your man is so rough. He squeezed my ass to swell, but only one side. Stop laughing, Lotus. Shame on you. Look! My boobs swell on one side too, see? Why did you squeeze only this side? Want me to do it at the other side? You crazy! By the way, it's not a bad idea. For you. What is it? It's a human finger. It must be Gud's finger. Gud's finger? Why you have to say it? It's not Gud's finger. But the ring... It's his ring. Yeah, sure. Sure enough! Damn sure, right? Ouch! It hurts. Hibiscus, your tank man is here. What are you ladies doing? We're just chatting. Nothing much. Here. Thank you. Well, I'll bring it for... That's all right. Thank you very much. He's coming to see Rose. Thank you. Are you all right? I'm okay. Thank you. Follow her. Let her be herself. Since she's born, It's the first day that a man has given her flowers. I don't think we should fall in love with anyone. Do you remember my wedding day? Are you accepting this man to be your husband? No, you don't! Sam. Yeah... I agree with you. We can't love anyone. All of our loved ones end up in tragic death. I think I should break up with Gud. I don't want to see him dead. Good for you. For us Chai Lais, our mission is everything. Wait a minute! Mine is not like your case. My boyfriend and I love each other. We don't have any problems like yours. I'm almost 10 years older, we still have a love story. Is it love story or love stinks? Look! He's just right on time! Let me see what he's just sent. Mr. Somsak wants to see us. Mr. Somsak. Mr. Somsak. Mr. Somrak. Boss! Boss! Boss! Where is he? Oops! Message. Just turn on the IPod And you will see the command. Tony Jeng. I was informed that the spy you sent will start the operation tonight. Rose, Lotus, Pouy-sian... don't let the cub out of your sight. Spadix and Hibiscus... go follow every step of Mei Ling in Bangkok. All information is in the book behind the IPOD. Commence the operation. Now. Boss! He should have just called us... So we don't have to make a trip over here. Don't you know our boss is in fashion? Look at his face and you'll see. Oh, your face has a modern look? Okay. Let's get to work. Hey, what's your name? I'm Miki. Do you know Rose? Yes. - That means you know Chai Lais, right? - Yes, I do. Could you give this banknote to Chai Lais? Could you give this banknote to Chai Lais? Give it to them once you get out of here. Take them out of here! Go! Hey, kid. Come here. You better tell me... why this bill is so important. Don't tell him. Just tell him how it's important. And he won't hurt me. She's trying to burn it. That means that bill is very important. Just tell him what you know, honey. Please. Please. Hey! A tiger is now in the cave. Let me see. Gud. I thought you wouldn't care about him. I just call his name, that's it. Sir. What? It must be on that island. Come on. Come on. Finally! The Queen of Andaman is in my hand. No! It belongs to my daddy. - Come here. - Bratty kid. Chai Lai. Those damn Chai Lais. Why don't they just get off my back? Go get them! Come here. Chai Lais! Help me. Help me. Chai Lais. Let go. Chai Lais! Help me. Rose. Rose. How dare they beard us in our den! I saw them at the beginning. Our boss just invited them here. Bro. Daddy is here, bro. Your dad also got invited?

Of course, today all of you... ...will see the most precious pearl in the world. It's the Queen of Andaman. It belongs to my daddy. Ladies and Gentlemen, Let's start the bidding. Who have the business? Who has the highest bid? Wow! Surprise! Nobody will possess this pearl. Papa! Professor. Miki, don't you worry. I'm here to save you. How are you? I'm fine. This pearl is worth more than that. Get him. Chai Lais! Your fun time is over. Those who don't get involved, fuck off! Did you hear that? Why are you standing here? Get out! Let's kick their assess. You'll get my boss over my dead body. How could you do that? She's pregnant. She's full of shit. Look in her hand. Oops! Benlo. (Iron supplement) get out go You are just right on time, bitches. Rose. What should we do, boss? Earth, get my kid out of here. Get that girl with us. Do as we plan! You guys stay here. I'll be right back. Wait for me. Follow me. - Let me go. - Darkie, finish them. Papa!

Where the heck are you going? Oh, sorry, sir. I forgot. Are you done yet? Let's go. - Come on. - Go! You've always come in my way. Rose And obstructed the works of mine. Let him go now!

It's me who loves you more than anyone I will take care of you. I promise. I'll take care of you. You can't dying on me, Gud. Don't you remember your promise? You told me that you'll take care of me forever. You can't leave me like this. Stay with me. Don't leave me, Gud. Gud, I'm sorry. Don't leave me. You promise that you'll take care of me? You can't leave me like this. Rose. Rose. Gud. Hey kid, tell me... ...how to take the pearl out of the glass ball. I'm not telling you. Tell me! No! Tell me now! No! You're a total imbecile. Why the hell did you stop the car? Here we are, sir. You go get her. Boss. Stop. I said stop. Stop. Boss. Boss. Kong, go get that girl. And meet me on the roof-deck. All right. Stop. Hold it right there. Don't you know who I am? Shit! What took them so long? Hey! Chai Lai! I'm impressed you can find me. I'm not here for you. I want to retrieve the treasure of the nature. The treasure of the nature? It's my treasure. I have billions with me and I won't let it get off my hand. You know what? This Andaman Pearl is the balance keeper for the ocean. You must return it to where it belongs, or else it'll generally lose the energy... ...and resulting in a huge explosion. The whole city will be destroyed. Give it back. Now! Really? An explosion... What a joke! If you want it, come and get it. Go! Wait! Let me get my leg off the railing. I told you, don't overact! Go! Stop kicking, you nasty girl. Catch her! Go get that girl. Yes, boss. I've just dropped the gun, boss. Pick it up. How dare you want to fight with me! Damn! You were born today. It's 'Yesterday'! You smart ass! Have you found it yet? No, not yet. Where the hell is my gun? Find it yet? If I were rich, I would have my eyes fixed. So I can see things correctly. What are you holding in your hand? A gun. Kathleen, shoot that kid! Yes, Madam! Kathleen, what have you done? Shoot her, not me! Oops! Sorry! My bad! Shoot! Okay. Did I get her? You still got me, not her. You want another shot? Shoot! Right away! How come she's still alive? Is she dead yet? Not yet! She's running away. Shoot her again. Shoot! Okay. Follow her! Follow her! Okay. Let's go. I thank all of you, for a job well done. Anyway, Without the help of my trusted spy, this mission may unable to accomplish. Ladies... I'd like to introduce... Kathleen. Watch your step. Be careful. Beware the step, you crazy-eyed bitch. Come here. This is my trusted spy. We'll get married soon. Why did you let her get pregnant before marriage? She's not pregnant. It's just her cute little tummy. After our honeymoon, I'll need an ophthalmologist to operate the eyes. Oh, is it going to be for her, sir? No, for me! I want my eyes to be just like hers. How could she become a spy? We have absolutely no clue about it. Yeah. I'm a perfect actress, you know? A good spy must have a determined sight... ...like Kathleen. I have a new assignment for you all. I'll send you Chai Lais to pursue Bin Ladin. What? Bin Ladin! And I want you to meet a new member of Chai Lais. Miki-san. Hi! Come, my crazy-eyed darling. Don't look at me like that. Let's go. Tonight I'm gonna cure your eyes and make you... Papa, I did everything that you desire to do. Don't worry about me. I'll fight with bad people... to make sure that this world'd be a better place. May you live in peace, my beloved daddy. Get ready to see the next mission. Chai Lai goes to the battle. Don't come near me! I have a grenade, see? Kathleen. Throw the grenade! Rock and roll! Charge! Shoot them, Kathleen! Shoot them! Shoot! Back off, or you'll be dead. Shoot! Let's go! I fled to the south and you're still after me Kathleen. Miki. Pouy-sian Miki. Don't give him a damn! Die! Miki. Pouy-sian Keep fighting... Chai Lai!
