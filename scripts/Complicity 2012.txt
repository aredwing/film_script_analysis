[ Marching Band ] [ Continues ] [ Whistle Blows ] [ Fades Out ] Can anyone tell me the meaning of "parataxis"? Anyone? Parataxis is the technique Allen Ginsberg experimented with... in his seminal, 1955 poem "Howl." Using starkly dissimilar images, he juxtaposed them with no clear connection. - This left the readers to make their own connections... - [ Chuckles ] Implied by the paratactic syntax. So he engaged the readers... [ Chuckles ] - To figure out his meaning. - [ Chuckles ] Samuel Beckett, widely regarded as one the most influential... poets, novelists, playwrights of the 20th century, was an extreme proponent of the paratactic form. This from Beckett's The Unnameable. "The Place. I'll make it all the same. I'll make it in my head, I'll draw it out of my memory. I'll gather it all about me. I'll make myself a head, I'll make myself a memory. I have only to listen: The voice will tell me everything, tell it to me again, everything I need in dribs and drabs"... [ Bell Rings ] "Breathless." Monday morning... Ginsberg's "Howl," parts one and two. Be warned. It has graphic sexual content. Ooh. Graphic sexual content. Hey, a party sounds great. I'll text you later. [ Man ] Shannon. - Bye. Can I speak to you for a moment? Here's my recommendation. Schneider's been hounding me for your entrance package. [ Squeals ] Thank you so much, Mr. Allusen. You are the best. Mmm! [ Chuckles ] Where are you going? Wellesley, I hope. My mom went there, so it's really important to her. Thank you. Thank you. Hey, what was that about? The recommendation that Schneider twisted his arm to get. Maybe now my mother can get off my back. Oh. Lucky. Scholarship? Scholarship? Are you kidding me? This is just my mother's game. She's an alumni, and she's already made a donation. - I'm going no matter what. - You don't want to go? Peace has its price. - Mm-hmm. - What are you planning after graduation? Oh, I don't know. I haven't thought about it. I'll just follow this body to my own higher education. What? You don't mean that. I don't have the pull, I don't have the grades, so I'll use what works. [ Rings ] [ Rings ] - Yeah? - Hello? Yeah, it's tonight at, um... - 9:00. Or should I do 8:00? - No. - Yes. Bring everybody and anybody. - She says 9:00. - And bring everything. - You're coming? [ Sniffles ] [ Exhales ] [ Tapping ] Come on. Close the door. So, and why did you miss our meeting last week? Don't know. Your parents didn't return my questionnaire I sent them. Did you give it to them? Sure. Dylan. Come on. I did. I don't... I don't know what they did with it. Look, sweetie, I'm the only one standing between you and Principal Malic expelling you. You understand that? Your grades have been very impressive... until this fall. Tell me why. What's going on? [ Man ] If I didn't have him in the house, things would have been fine! [ Woman ] Do you want him to carry that around for the rest of his life? Listen to me. Look at me. Okay. [ Sighs ] There is nothing I can do if you won't let me help you. Is that it? Yeah. [ Chattering ] [ Man ] Gross. Do you believe the math assignment she gave us? [ Man ] Smile, my lovely princesses. - Hello. - I only see one princess here. True. [ Laughs ] [ Kim ] Gorgeous, darling. Work it. Well, hello. [ Kim ] Nice shoes. [ Chuckles ] - Yeah. - Oh, yeah. [ Kim ] And who do we have here? - Don't point that at me! [ Chuckles ] Don't do it. He's serious. He's so strange. He's going to bust my camera. He's not going to bust anything. He's such a poser. He can bust anything he wants as long as it's me. [ Chuckles ] I heard he already did last summer. That true? No, it's all rumors, Kim. There's nothing to tell. - He's just shy. That's all. - Okay. I'll see you guys tonight. We'll all kick some major ass. - Okay. - Yeah. Hey, he's your mother. Hey, see you, buddy. - Hey, Kurt! - Hi. [ Rock On Radio ] Good luck tonight. What, you, uh, not coming to the game? I can't. My party. You're coming, aren't you? - Please. - I don't... I don't know. Oh, come on. You can bring Dwayne if you want. I'll see you tonight. [ Tires Squealing ] Women. [ Whistle Blows ] [ Chattering ] [ Whistle Blows ] [ Whistle Blows ] [ Crowd Shouting ] [ Crowd Cheering ] - Make way. [ Mica ] Work it. Work it. Oh, yeah. [ Chuckles ] [ Stereo: Rap ] - Right. Here we go. [ Mica ] Um, hello. Save some of that for me, Shannon. Whoo! Yeah! My party! Make way for the party queen. [ Continues ] Oh. [ Chuckles ] [ Mica ] Oh, God. Get a room. [ Laughs ] - Hello, you sexy thing. - Oh, hello. Hi. - Hey, guys. - Say hello to the camera, Shannon. Who are they? Go check the living room, okay? - Okay, see you in a bit. - Go check it. Love you. What do we have in this room? [ Stereo: Woman Singing ] Oh, a deejay. [ Continues ] [ Woman ] Hey, Mica. - Hello, you sexy thing. Spin me, baby. Spin me. - Spin me. - Hey, you. Handsome. There's my princess of darkness. [ Rap ] [ Laughing ] [ Continues ] That look in your eye has got me hypnotized [ Mica ] Look at that. But, girl, you got me feelin' high You rock that body, baby You really got me goin' crazy [ Continues ] - Hey. [ Mica ] Look at you. Hi. - Come on. [ Mica ] Look at her hair. [ Chuckles ] Hey. [ Mica Chuckles ] Cute. [ Continues ] Say it like you mean it, babe Say it like you want it [ Continues ] [ Mica ] Ooh, I want some of that. [ All Laughing ] Take the picture. Not bad for last-minute, huh? [ Sighs ] I should have been smart and charged everybody for this. Speaking of charging for it. What are you wearing? Don't worry, Shan. When you grow up, you might be able to pull off something like this. Maybe. [ Continues ] I want to feel it I want to feel it - Whatever. - Could... Could I get a hit of that? - Yeah. [ Coughs ] [ Laughing ] [ Coughing ] [ Stereo: Woman Singing ] If you look, you'll sense a charge of static energy Shoot down through me Force the impact was so unexpected Didn't know what hit me Gosh [ Continues ] You're not going Columbine on me, are you? And stole my mind Don't know what you started There's nothing to stop it [ Continues ] - Are you still staying at your grandma's? What do you care? Hey, what's with the attitude? School starts, and you turn into dark matter. I mean, you don't even look like yourself anymore. What's happened to you? You. That's what happened to me. You're so electric I'm so magnetic My pulse is racing You set my soul on fire [ Continues ] If you won't listen, how can I explain? What's to explain? I was stupid. That's all. [ Continues ] - I don't want to talk about it. - Okay, that's not fair. - How you played me... - That's not fair. To you everything's just a game. - But to me it wasn't. There's nothing to stop me [ Mica ] You've got to be kidding me. My thoughts are racing I can't believe you're taking over Taking over, babe You're so electric And so hypnotic You raise my temperature You set my soul on fire We lost. And on my first interception. I mean, I knew... I knew Picket couldn't pull it off. I mean, look. It took him forever to get down that field. And why? Why would Coach use that call? [ Chuckles ] You can't blame Picket, man. It was tipped. Out of how many completions tonight? [ Chuckles ] What's wrong with you? [ Pounding In Distance ] [ Sighs ] None of it matters. I mean, the scouts were there. Man, I sucked. You were there. You saw it. I mean, Coach couldn't even talk to me after the game. Yeah, I saw it. Coach and Mr. Davis had their hands full... trying to get your pops out of that locker room, like he was the Taliban or something. [ Doors Closing ] [ Chuckles ] He's a crazy son of a bitch, isn't he? [ Chuckles ] Yeah, he's... He's crazy. [ Dance ] [ Yells ] Shit! Man, I can't! I can't... I can't... I can't go home and face him. I just... I just can't, man. Maybe your girl will want you stay and hook up with her tonight. Nah, I can't do that. I don't know what I want, but I know what I need. - Let's get fucked up. [ Continues ] [ Chattering ] It's about to go down, man. [ Both Laughing ] [ Woman Singing ] You didn't pick me out Take me off the shelf Now why are they going... See Lucas out there? He's dancing up a storm, man. That kid can't stop. I've never seen... What is he? From, like, Kansas or something, and he's some country bumpkin fool who can dance, man? Like he's from the ghetto or something, you know. Hi. Go ahead. I am way ahead of you. [ Chuckles ] So what are you gonna do about your father? Kill him. Kill him. [ Chuckles ] Look. You're gonna get that scholarship. And when you do, you're gonna be able to get away from him. Well, that, uh, might not happen. I, uh... I lost the game tonight. Oh, yeah, scouts were there. So, you know, I don't know what's gonna happen now. Kurt, it was just one game. And besides... Besides what? Besides nothing. I was intercepted. Hey! How's it going, buddy? Hey! Uh, I was intercepted. We lost because of it. It doesn't get any more fucked up than that, right? Feeling sorry for yourself again. Feeling sorry for myself? Is that what you think this is? Isn't it? Isn't that what it always is? Poor Kurt. It is always all about you. - Ow! - All about me? Look at you. Look at how you live. Your life is taken care of by mommy and daddy. [ Scoffs ] Your... Your future, it's set. You don't have to do shit, and everything will just turn out great. You don't know what it's... what it's like in... in the real world. You're just... - ...perfect. - Stop. Come on. You know how to work it. You... [ Fingers Snaps ] Turn it on till you get what you want from people. The rest of us, we got to work for what we want. So don't you think you can judge me. [ Continues ] Have a drink. Great party. [ Continues ] [ Mica ] Who can make me a cosmo? Do I look like a Sex and the City kinda brother? [ Laughs ] Cosmo? Cosmo? - Hey! Easy. - Sorry. - Do you know how to make one? - Nope. Pretty sure I'd like 'em. [ Laughs ] [ Laughs ] Mica, you don't know me, but I definitely know who you are. And I think you're, like, the coolest guy in school. - [ Dwayne Laughs ] - Seriously, I do. You're so damn hot. I have so many friends that would love to get you straight. You and your friends think I'm gay? [ Laughing ] No. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to imply that. I mean, that's how rumors get started. Whoa! [ Chuckles ] I think I'm gonna be sick. [ Chuckles ] Wow. That looks good. [ Chuckles ] Poor thing. [ Thunder Rumbling ] [ Wind Whistling ] [ Stereo: Woman Singing ] [ Chuckles ] Dance with me. Come on. [ Chuckles ] [ Continues ] [ Chuckles ] You're not dancing with me. I don't really dance. Who doesn't dance? [ Chuckles ] [ Chuckles ] Hey. I saw you watching me earlier. [ Continues ] [ Dance ] [ Man Singing ] [ Groans ] Shit! - Shit! [ Man ] What was that? [ Girl ] Shannon! Great party! [ Sobbing ] Oh, you're not gonna puke on me, are you? [ Sobbing ] Kimberly. [ Sobbing Continues ] What's going on? Oh, my God. What happened to you? [ Sobbing ] Kimberly. [ Knocking ] It's busy! What happened? [ Kurt ] Come on! I got to pee! [ Man Singing ] [ Continues ] Hey, turn the music off. Turn the music off! [ Stops ] Everyone, party is over! [ All ] Ohh! - That's it. Sorry. You guys need to go home. Shannon, what's going on? Please help me get everybody out of here. - Now. - Come on, you guys! Come on! Everybody get out! Please, everybody leave! [ Mica ] Get out! [ Chattering ] [ Mica ] Thank you for coming! Party's over! Everyone out! Thank you. Thank you for coming. [ Chattering ] - Party's just getting started. [ Mica ] I don't care! Tough shit! Come on, get out! [ Kurt ] Hey, where is he? Huh? Tell me where he is! [ Chattering ] Where is he, huh? Have you seen him? Where's that bastard? [ Chattering ] [ Dwayne ] Come on. Yo, come on. Come on, move your asses. Time to go. Come on. - What the hell is going on? - I don't know. Shannon wants us to get everybody out. [ Kurt ] Hey, get out of my way! - Hey, other way. [ Shannon ] Sorry. You have to go. [ Chattering ] Hey! [ Kurt ] Hey, where is he, huh? Where is this fucker? [ Engine Starting ] [ Knocking ] [ Shannon ] Kim, it's me. [ Kiss ] [ Sobbing ] [ Thunder Rumbling ] [ Dog Barking In Distance ] Dude, enough with the camera already, seriously. [ Yells ] [ Grunts ] [ Yells ] Bastard! [ Punches Landing ] [ Dylan ] Get... Get off of me! - Let me go! - Get the fuck off of me! Help! He's going to kill him! Help! Somebody stop him! He's gonna kill him! Dwayne, he's gonna kill him! - Aah! - Yo, man! What you doin'? - Calm down! Come on! - Get off me! - Calm the fuck down! - Let me go! Calm your ass down! Calm down! [ Coughing ] - [ Groans ] - Hey, man, look at this. [ Groans ] What did you do that for? [ Yells ] [ Shouting In Distance, Indistinct ] I'll be right back. Stay here. [ Both Shouting ] What's going on? [ Groans ] Dylan. Kurt started beating the shit out of him for no reason. - Oh, my God. - Ahh. Just leave me alone. Kurt, what is wrong with you? You don't take it out on somebody half your size! Calm down! - Calm down! - Get the fuck off of me! Shut up! I don't want to hear it! Calm down! Stop it! [ Clatters On Floor ] Let me go! Let go of me, man! - [ Spits ] - What did you do? What do you expect? You can't just go off on people like that! The fucker deserves everything that's coming to him! - What is he talking about? [ Kim ] Rape. He raped me. Ooh! [ Chuckles ] Oh. Dance with me. Come on. [ Laughs ] Hey. - We have to call the police. - No, we don't. - [ Yells ] - Stop it! - Stop hitting him! - Stop! Go back! Quit it! - We have to - call the police. - No. That makes no sense. Why wouldn't you? [ Kim's Voice ] You're so quiet all the time. You were watching me, weren't you? Now you want to dance. Okay, stop. No! This make you all feel better? [ Spits ] [ Kim ] You bet it makes me feel better. Look at what you did to me. Look at me! You pig. You like that, do you? [ Laughs ] [ Laughs ] [ Laughing ] - Oh, Dylan! - [ Grunts ] [ Muffled ] Stop it! Stop it! - [ Muffled ] - [ Grunting ] [ Screams ] [ Screams, Sobbing ] Stop! Please! [ Grunts ] - [ Screaming ] - [ Grunting ] Stop! No! [ Zipper Unzips ] [ Grunts ] Please don't! Please don't! Stop! [ Sobbing ] Please, don't! Stop! [ Grunts ] Ahh! [ Grunts ] Why are you lying? This is ridiculous. Dylan wouldn't rape anyone. I found Kim in the bathroom. You raped Kim. [ Kurt ] What, you think is a joke, huh? Listen, man, this ain't no joke. Did you do it? This is a fucking joke. [ Sobbing ] [ Sobbing ] I'm leaving. This is fucked up. - Just stay where you are. Kurt, back off! - [ Lacy ] Please, stop! I know Dylan. He couldn't have done it. Look at her, Lacy! We can all see what he did! - We can't let him leave! - Hold on, all of you! But that's what she says. I mean, I saw the way that she was coming on to him. - We all did. - What? Are you saying I asked for it? - Not exactly. - I would expect this from him. Not you. I'm just saying that we should hear both sides. Ask him, if you think it's so goddamn important. I mean, you know the kid. Go on. Ask him! We need to hear what he has to say. [ Kim's Voice ] Lacy told me every juicy detail. Show me what she likes. Say something. Tell me, if you won't tell them. Tell me you didn't do this. You have to ask me? God, you don't know me at all, do you? I thought I did. I wanted to. I really did. But I mean, the way that you've been acting lately. The way you looked at Kim tonight. What? Are you as crazy as all of them? So you didn't do anything, right, Dylan? Then who did this? Oh, my God. Jesus. You have no limits, do you? Come on, Lacy. Tell them. I mean, look at that. That's sick. I didn't touch her! [ Laughs ] [ Dylan ] That's it, isn't it? - Because I wouldn't touch you. - I told you no. You wouldn't take no for an answer. - [ Grunting ] - [ Sobbing ] - I'm gonna take care of him myself! - Hey, hey, hey... God! How could you do that? - That's sickening! - You pervert! - [ Shannon ] Get him! - Is this what you like to do to girls, huh? [ Dwayne ] Time out, man! Time out! You're disgusting! - I didn't do anything! - [ Punches Landing ] - Let go. Get off! Enough! - No, just shut up! I hate you! I hate you so much! I didn't do anything! [ Screams ] [ Groans ] Are you afraid yet? Whoo! [ Groaning ] I begged you to stop! - [ Shouting ] - You lying asshole! I'm not afraid of you. [ Dwayne ] Wait! Wait! Wait! - [ Groans ] - [ Screams ] - Stop it! [ Indistinct ] - [ Laughing ] - [ Grunting ] - [ Gasps ] - [ Coughs ] - [ Clink ] [ Gagging, Gasping ] - [ Gags ] - [ Fingers Snap ] - [ Gagging ] - [ Screams ] [ Shouting, Indistinct ] [ Heartbeat ] [ Lacy ] Dylan? [ Knife Clatters On Floor ] [ No Audible Dialogue ] [ No Audible Dialogue, Continues ] [ Mica ] This is a nightmare. He deserved it after what he did to me. You all know that's true. [ Shannon ] What have you done? He's dead. There is a dead guy in my house! God! Help me! [ Sobs ] Get out! Get out, all of you! Hey, hey, calm down. It's gonna be all right. We'll figure something out, okay? [ Shannon Sobbing ] Hey. It's not gonna be okay! Please, get out! Get out! Get out, all of you! Please, go. Please. [ Sobbing ] Get out, all of you! He's dead! What are we gonna do? He raped Kim! That doesn't give you the right to kill him, Kurt! Yeah! You don't even know if he really raped her! You think I'm lying? Dylan denied it, and now he's dead. - What'd you expect him to say, Dwayne? - We got that part. But we did not kill him, okay? How do you know you didn't kill him? You're the one that was beating the shit out of him. Yeah, this is all your fault! I mean, you started this! No! No, it isn't! I... I mean... I mean... [ Kurt ] Oh, Jesus. Look at that. What's gonna happen to me? Everything... Shut up. It's not about you. I'm the victim here. I'm the one that he attacked! [ Dwayne ] But he didn't need to die! I didn't do it. How do you know that? You had a knife in your hand. - But I didn't stab him with it! - I know I didn't! How do you know? None of this would have happened if you didn't get so violent... and gone after him. I'm the only one here with the balls enough to do anything about this. Besides, you didn't do anything to stop me! I mean... - I tried to stop you! [ Kurt ] None of you did! Everybody shut the fuck up! This kid is dead for real... and all y'all can do is point fingers? - It was an accident! - I didn't want to kill him. - Who are you kidding? - [ Sighs ] Fuck. [ Sobbing ] [ Kim ] Oh, my God. How's this gonna look? You know how this is gonna look? Like you accused someone of raping you, and now they're dead. You think I'm lying? I'm the only one that never touched him. Not once. And that's the truth. I have nothing to worry about. You could have done something to stop it, but you didn't. You're just as guilty as anyone here. I'm guilty because I didn't do anything? Oh, that's priceless, Kim. Do you ever realize that every time you do anything and it goes to shit, it's always someone else's fault. Look at Lacy's hands if you don't believe me. [ Panting ] Look at my hands. Clean. No, that doesn't mean anything. So don't blame me. Okay? We're all in this together. All of us! How can you say that? - Because she's right. [ Shannon ] No! I'm not guilty. I'm guilty for believing you. What? The way you act. [ Chuckles ] The way you dress. You just... flaunt it. Go to hell, Shannon. [ Dwayne ] That's it. That's it. I'm done. I'm done for real. I'm not fucking up my life for y'all. Hey. Hey. Hey. Wait. Dwayne, please. I don't know what we should do, but we should stick together. Look, y'all can stay together if you want, but I'm no part of this! Yes. Yes, you are. We're all a part of this. - Get out of my way. - Don't! Get your hands off me. I tried to stop you, but you came here looking for trouble, and you found it! [ Kurt ] No. [ Kim ] You leave now, and we tell the cops you killed him. - You can't do that. - Yes, we can. And we will. See. You leave, we say you did it. You see this? All of us. This is the bullshit I'm talking about. Dwayne. Hey. Hey, wait up, man. Hey. Man, we're friends, you know. We gotta work this thing out together. Don't you get gangsta with me, dog. You confused. I ain't your friend. That's football. On the field I got your back, but I don't got your back when you beat down some kid so you can feel better about yourself. Don't force us, man. I'm not forcing anybody to do anything. Do you see what's going on here? Don't you understand? Our lives, our futures, they're on the line here. I do. 'Cause I'm the nigga you're ready to throw to the cops to save your own punk ass. I know what's on the line. It's been that way all my life. I'm out. [ Kim ] Let him go. We gave him his chance. You got to be kidding. We can't just blame this on him. Then who? You? I'm not gonna let that happen. Dwayne. Dwayne, wait up, man. Hey, we gotta... Hey, we gotta stick together, man. Why? Y'all can stay together. But I'm not getting any more involved in that crazy shit. I mean, if we don't... if we don't figure something out, then none of us have a future. That's for damn sure, 'cause I'm looking at my future, right here, right now, and I don't like what I see, Kurt. It wasn't my fault. I don't believe that that was some accident. That house has got nothing but hate going on, and that kid was a target for all of it. But you don't understand that, do you? [ Scoffs ] Oh, damn. Now I don't owe nobody nothin'. You hear me? Nobody. Fuck. I thought... I thought we were friend... [ Wind Whistling ] [ Door Closes ] [ Footsteps Approaching ] [ Kim ] I knew he wouldn't come back. All right. We have to get our story straight. I can't do this. Yes, you can, and you will. [ Door Closes ] Maybe Dylan was tellin' the truth. You come on to him. He's not interested. So you say he raped you. It's not the first time a bitch points a finger at a guy. But y'all go crazy on that kid. No questions. Not one! - She calls rape... Pow! - [ Gasps ] The kid's guilty. That's what I don't understand. Y'all got so much hatred in your hearts. - I just wanted... - Save it. Just save it. So then why did you come back? [ Dwayne Sighs ] I don't know. [ Mica ] All we care about is ourselves. - What about Dylan? [ Kim ] Wait a minute, Mica. Kim! Enough! No one wants to hear it anymore. It doesn't matter! I'd never seen anybody die before except on TV or in movies. But in there... That's what real death looks like. And we all have to live with that for the rest of our lives. Even you. We can't just leave him in there. [ Sniffles ] I'll go get you a sweater. [ Women Speaking, Muffled ] [ Mica Breathing ] [ Static ] [ Sniffling ] [ Sobbing ] Does it matter what happened? You didn't deserve this. [ Sobbing ] I should have helped you. Forgive me. [ Sniffling ] Forgive us. [ Water Running ] [ Dishes Clink ] [ Lacy ] None of you knew him like I did. He was so sweet... and gentle... and funny... even when everything around him was so horrible. He used to sneak into my garage at night. And I'd give him blankets. Just anything to get away from the madness at home. Sometimes we would just lay there. For hours. And not say anything. [ Sobbing ] But the closer that we got... the worse I treated him. And I don't know why. [ Sniffles ] I just couldn't stop myself. [ Thunder Rumbling ] No matter how shitty I was... he would take it. And... he told me he loved me. And I laughed at him. [ Inhales ] I wish that I could take it back. I tried. But when I saw him at school, he just avoided me. He was angry all the time. I didn't even know who he was anymore. [ Kim ] Now you know. You're lucky to be rid of him. Fuck you! Fucking bitch! He'd be alive if it weren't for you. He'd still be alive if you hadn't stabbed him! - We're goin' to jail. - Shut up! Stop it! We are all going to jail. You know that, right? - All of us! - No, we're not. I am scared, but I'm not stupid. [ Sobbing ] It's not gonna be okay. Nothing ever is going to be okay ever again. And you can't fix that! Don't you understand that? [ Dwayne ] Just stop it, all of you. Cryin' and arguin' about who's to blame is not gonna change anything that happened. You asked me why I came back? Because we're all to blame. [ Gasps ] That's God's simple truth. The boy is dead. I'm about saving my ass, and that means yours too. [ Gasps ] What are we gonna do, man? We are going in there and gettin' rid of him, then gettin' the hell outta here. Nobody here knows nothin' about that kid. He was at the party, and nobody's seen him. You got it? Then, we take him north. They'll never find him. Yo, come on. Let's go. Let's go! Is this what we should be doing? This isn't right. Anybody have a better idea? [ Thunder Rumbling ] Like it or not, we're all complicit. You want to survive this? Fuck. [ Gasping ] Not those. Yo, Shannon, hurry up with those towels. - Use these. - [ Breathing Heavily ] We'll get through this. We have to. Where do you want this? Hold on. We got to get this cleaned up first. Hey, Shannon, where's the garbage bags? Over there. [ Glasses Clattering ] [ Bag Snaps ] Mica, give us a hand. You two get that party mess cleaned up. [ Gasping ] Everybody, listen up. From now on, things are gonna be different. You're gonna treat me with some goddamn respect. And you're not gonna laugh at me ever again. None of you. [ Bottles Clattering ] - Hey, let me do that. - Stop. You fucking idiot! I just fucking cleaned that up! Now look what you've done. [ Gasps ] Give me some goddamn paper towels. I didn't mean to mess up. Yeah, but you did, didn't you? Hurry up! Here. [ Dwayne ] Do you have any tape? Duct tape? [ Kurt ] Right over there. By the stove. Top drawer. What now? Nothing. We go back to our lives like nothing ever happened. You get up, you go to school, whatever. Can we trust them? [ Scoffs ] [ Dwayne ] Mica, get the shower curtain. [ Sniffling ] Give me that! [ Dwayne ] Come on. Come on! Let's go! [ Clapping ] Yo, get his legs. [ Groans ] - Got him? - [ Grunts ] Watch it. [ Wind Whistling ] [ Whimpering ] [ Shannon Whimpering ] It's gonna be light soon. Kurt, get your car. Be cool, man. [ Panting ] [ Inhales ] [ Sobbing ] No. It's okay. It's okay, Shannon. [ Inhales ] Come on. [ Sniffling ] Kurt's right. Right about what? About me. I smile... and pretend that everything's perfect. Do what's... expected of me. It's all a lie. My life feels like... a dream. So... far away from anything real. [ Chuckles ] And now this? I can't go back anymore. I can't pretend. We will never go back to how we were. You've never lived a lie? You've always been true to yourself. We all lie. We do what we need to. We lie to ourselves, choose to lie to our friends. Because we're not happy with who we are. [ Scoffs ] Now we have no choice. It's all one big lie that we have to live with forever. [ Vehicle Approaches ] Mica... The rest of you stay here. He's not gonna fit inside the trunk. [ Sighs ] We're gonna have to put him in the back seat. Fine. Get his legs. - [ Girl Screams ] - [ Shouts ] - Oh, my God! - Oh, my God! - Who is she? - How do I know? [ Screams ] What have you done? - [ Screams ] - Please! Please, don't. Stop! Don't come any closer! - Just calm down. - [ Kurt ] Shut up! Now. Please. [ Screams ] What the fuck? Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Look, this is no time to panic! - [ Gasps ] - Shit. This way. Stop her. [ Screams ] Stop! Everybody stop! Don't come any closer to me! We just want to talk. It's okay. I saw him in there. He's dead. He's fucking dead! Let me go! Just let me go! - [ Dwayne ] Get her! - [ Shannon ] Wait, wait, wait, wait! Damn it! - Just go away! Leave me alone, please! [ Kurt ] Open the door. Nobody's gonna hurt you. Who is she? - Oh, my God. Cosmo girl. - What? I've seen her at school. [ Kim ] What are we gonna do with her? [ Sobbing ] [ Sobs ] Calm down, okay? We just want to talk. Just please, please don't hurt me. Please. Please, just go away! No one is going to hurt you, okay? I promise. Can you open the door? Just get away from me! Just leave me alone! [ Gasping ] I saw him. He's dead! I know. [ Girl Sobs ] - Can you just let us explain? Please. [ Gasping ] [ Lacy ] Let us in. [ Doorknob Rattles ] [ Crash ] Stay back! Get out! Back up right now! [ Lacy ] We just... - Get back from me. We just wanna talk. Just put it down, okay? No one's gonna hurt you, I promise. - We just wanna talk. - Back away from me. Hey, y-you're in cheer, right? No, I'm in marching band. - Marching band's cool. - Shut up. No, it's not. Everybody knows that it's not cool, okay? What's your name? Rachel. Rachel? Okay. Rachel, this isn't what it appears to be. What is it then? Dylan... raped Kim. Dylan Hudson? He raped Kim? I don't know. It's really hard for me to believe that he could do anything like that. It's true. Then what happened to Dylan? An accident. It's hard to explain, but that is all that you need to know. This is all just really weird. We understand. Can you keep our secret? Okay. Yeah. [ Pole Clatters ] - Yeah. It'll be our little secret. We can, like, hang out and do stuff together... Yeah, yeah. I totally get it, you guys. I'll keep it a secret. Just us. That sounds great. Yeah. We'll all be good friends. That's so great. I have so many friends that you guys are really gonna like. What is she talking about? Rachel, we've got to go. Got it. I'm just gonna get my shoes, okay? Wait. Hey. - Do you have a car? - Sure. I mean, it's my mom's. But, yeah. What kind? An S.U.V. Why? We need a bigger car. Okay. I get it. What are friends for? [ Chuckles ] - What are you doing? - You know you can't trust her. What's with the car? [ Birds Cawing ] [ Sighs ] I don't know about this. Listen. We get Dylan in her car, and what can she do? Nothing. - All right, now what? - Bring your car up the drive. Don't make any noise. Mica, go with her. This is insane. She's crazy. We can't trust her to keep quiet. Listen. Kim's on point. Once we get her involved, she won't be able to say anything. [ Kim ] Don't be stupid. She'll never keep her mouth shut. [ Dwayne ] I don't get it. This was your idea. Get her involved? She can't say nothing? And we have. We still won't be able to trust her. We get Dylan in her car, and we drive north. Together. So then what do we do with... No. No. Do you want to go to college? Or you want to go to jail? [ Kim ] Don't look so surprised, you guys. There's no other way, and you know it. No. No way. No. No, he's right. We can't. You want to put the rest of our lives in that girl's hands? You think she's gonna keep this quiet? Maybe for a few days, a week. But we all know she'll blow it. We don't have another choice. Dylan was bad enough. But the girl? She didn't do anything. Not yet. [ Sighs ] Come on. Let's get this done. You takin' this shit too far. I'm not gonna let you hurt that girl. Let me? You're not gonna let me what? Dwayne, it's not me. It's us. Remember? You're a part of us, whether you like it or not. This is what we have to do. This is survival. - [ Door Closes ] - [ Sighs ] Mica. Help me with this. Don't you think you should help too? [ Bird Caws ] - [ Grunts ] - [ Thud ] [ Sighs ] Wh-What's going on? Come on. What is it? [ Dwayne ] Go on, Kim. Tell him. I think he deserves to know. Don't you? Tell me what? [ Ragged Breathing ] [ Vehicle Approaching ] [ Sirens, Faint ] [ Panting ] - [ Engine Sputters ] - [ Sirens, Faint ] [ Whispers ] Oh, my God. [ Engine Starts ] [ Siren Wails ] Shit. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Fuck. Oh, my God. Who called them? Who? [ Screams ] [ Shannon ] Sorry, Officer. It really was just supposed to start small. And then people started... You know, it turned into something way bigger than it was supposed to be. I was gonna call the police, but you know... My parents are out of town, and that's why I had them step in for a little bit. Because it got out of hand. [ Chuckles ] [ Sobs ] [ Tires Screech ] [ Sobbing ] [ Rapid Honking ] [ Honking Continues ] - Oh, God. Please help me, please. [ Water Babbling ] [ Dog Panting ] [ Flies Buzzing ] - [ Whistle Blows ] - [ Drums Pound ] [ Whistle Blows ] [ Allusen ] Pa... ra... tax... is. Parataxis. Can anyone explain Ginsberg's use of parataxis? Anyone? Samuel Beckett? All right then. Kimberly. Can you describe how Ginsberg used parataxis? He, uh... He used words to express how he felt. But not the right words. He chose his words carefully. He painted a different reality, but he can't tell you what it is. He wants to say something else, entirely. You have to decide what it is. Go on. He... makes a puzzle with his words. Creates a rhythm with his breath. It's like everything's disconnected. He's not gonna just come out and tell you what he's thinking. He hides his true meaning. No one can be trusted with it. You have to... find out the truth on your own. That was a very creative answer, Kimberly. Let me read some excerpts from Beckett's The Unnameable again... so you might be able to expand on Kimberly's answer. "It's like a confession, a last confession, you think it's finished, then it starts again, there were so many sins, the memory is so bad, the words don't come, the words fail, [ Allusen And Dylan ] the breath fails." [ Dylan ] "I don't know: Perhaps it was all a dream, all a dream." [ Mica, Narrating ] "That would surprise me. - I'll wake, in the silence, and never sleep again. - [ School Bell Rings ] It will be I? Or dream, dream again, dream of a silence, a dream silence, full of murmurs. I don't know, that's all words, never wake, all words, there's nothing else. You must go on, that's all I know. They're going to stop, I know that well: I can feel it. They're going to abandon me. It will be the silence, for a moment, a good few moments. Or it will be mine? The lasting one, that didn't last, that still lasts? It will be I? You must go on. I can't go on. [ Student Shouts, Indistinct ] You must go on. I'll go on. [ Whistle Blows ] You must say words, as long as there are any... until they find me, until they say me. Strange pain, strange sin! You must go on. Perhaps it's done already. Perhaps they have said me already. Perhaps they have carried me to the threshold of my story, before the door that opens on my story. That would surprise me, if it opens." Hut! Hut! [ Whistle Blowing Rapidly ] Hut! [ Growling ] [ Narrating Continues ] It will be I? It will be the silence, where I am? - I don't know, I'll never know: In the silence you don't know. - [ Grunts ] You must go on. I can't go on. I'll go on. Have either of you seen Dylan Hudson this morning? [ Shannon On Camera, Screaming ] How could you do that? [ Mica On Camera ] That's sickening! [ Kurt On Camera ] You pervert! [ Shannon ] Get him! [ Kurt ] Is that what you like to do to girls, huh? [ Camera Clicks Off ] [ Vehicle Approaches ] [ Rock ] Save me My name is Trouble Innocence I want my innocence back Save me They call me Trouble Innocence Give me my innocence back Take me there when I was young, yeah The wall was big But I didn't feel small I could breathe, and I could dance I set the pace and the rest would follow Polka dot, polka dot He could take us back We grow up, up, We grow old Save me My name is Trouble Innocence I want my innocence back Save me They call me Trouble Innocence Give me my innocence back Shelter me from all temptation Honesty I want to take myself back Save me Cleanse my sorrow Innocence I want my innocence back Back, back Back, back Innocence back I wanna go back Back, back Innocence back I wanna go back Back, back Innocence back Oh Polka dot, polka dot Save me My name is Trouble Innocence I want my innocence back Save me They call me Trouble Innocence Give me my innocence back Shelter me from all temptation Honesty I want to take myself back Save me Cleanse my sorrow Innocence I want my innocence back Back, back, innocence back We grow up, up We grow old I wanna go back I want my innocence back We grow up, up We grow old Innocence back Polka dot Polka dot He could take us back [ Woman ] Can we taste the hush that surrounds us? As we embrace [ Man ] A whispered scream thrust upon us And we vibrate [ Man, Woman ] With promises Still to make Oh The ties that bind us are dying To come undone All sins are justified in the name of love Our bodies paralyzed and twisting into one Into this world we are flying Closer to the sun Closer to the sun Closer to the sun, oh The ties that bind us are dying To come undone All sins are justified in the name of love Our bodies paralyzed and twisting into one Into this world we are flying Closer to the sun Closer to the sun Closer to the sun
