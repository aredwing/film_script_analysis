As the saying goes: "A photograph is worth a thousand..."? Words! Castro, you are not a writer. You are a police investigator. Think like one! For example, when you're investigating a crime scene that happened inside a house... Where do you start: outside-in or inside-out? Out! Macapagal! - Sir, inside-out! - Wrong! - Sir, outside-in. - Of course, correct!. There were only two options - You're only guessing. - No, sir, I'm not! Really? Explain it then. That's already your second question, sir. He does not know, sir! Explain For it to be systematic, sir? Take the money back, sir! - he can have it. - Take it back, sir! - Take it back! - When approaching a crime scene... You make notes of the conditions of the house... See you later in Luneta. Is the house isolated or does it have neighbors. OK. If it's soil, does it have any foot or tireprints? Are there any curtains at the windows? Are there signs of forcible entry? And then, slowly, you go inside the house. Use your nose Are there any strange scents? Use your ears. Is the radio on? the TV? or the fan? Use your eyes. are the lights on? And then, slowly, you go to the master's bedroom. In the master's bedroom, there's blood all-over. On the floor, and on the bed. On the bed, you see the victim... You recognize the victim And the victim is... Macapagal! You're not listening! - Did you see the policeman's gun? - yeah. When I get into the service I would buy a better one. The one that was used in James Bond Join our team! We're still lack of members I'd take care of you Even Ato and John-john joined us, they're already paid. It's fun! The other day, I had the ball, dribbled, then shoot. Scored! Didn't you get pissed? No, they thought they've gained a foul.. We've won! I still have some spare coins. Being stingy pays! - Can you lend me 50 pesos? - Here. - It's not enough. - Don't bother me with it. I have to catch the bus. Just walk. I'd send you a message How are you, old man! - Is this all? - Yes Thanks! How are you? Thanks! - It's not enough. - I'd pay in full next time Fuck you! You're wasting my time Bring it next time, ok?!

Why didn't he come here? He's shy. Where is he? Just outside. Who's that? Madonna. Vic, Franco still never showed up to me. I went last night at their house, but he's not there. The bastard! He's hiding from me. But somebody told me that he's at Tikboy's place. I'd hunt for him there. Fuck it, Vic! Strangle her! - Peping, a handkerchief! - Vic, what's going on? Vic! Tape! Tape!

The fucking junkie is asking for a beating. But from what I've heard, kap, you need to have good english-speaking skills, speaking in Tagalog is not allowed there. For sure, Louie would fail. He knows nothing but chasing girls. I saw him on Eastwood with a new girl. Like father, like son! Be mad at him if he's busy with cocks! Let's see if he dares! I'd let him suck a gun.

For those who just tuned in... there has been another severed head found in Quezon City. A lot of incidences like this are happening for some time now severed body parts were discovered. Just recently, a severed arm was found in Caloocan. This dreadful syndicate, who's victim are being chopped into pieces are once again on the move. This syndicate is something is not an easy enemy since they never let anyone get out alive. And the problem here is that... the body parts are scattered in different locations which makes it difficult for the police to determine where the crime scene is and it's perpetrators. Fuck it, the tire blew up! Sir, come on! Come in!
