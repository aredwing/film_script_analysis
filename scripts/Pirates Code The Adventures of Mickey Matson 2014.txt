[metal clanking [boat engine running It's Billy Lee. He's bustin' us out. Hey, come on now. I am first! Why you first? Because I'm prettier. Uh! Dagnabit, that is your fault. Why is it my fault? Groaning You ain't gonna fit through that hole. You eatin' them grits and cornbread. Come on, push harden You ain't tryin' hard enough. Hurry before someone sees us now. Let me go! Brother! Wait, don't! Hey! Baby brother! You got some nerve! Ooh! You need a hand there, Jeremiah? Who are you'? Jeremiah... ...Billy Lee. I ain't Billy Lee. Bobby Lee? What are you doing here, my boy? I took Billy Lee's place for a bit. He said he had to work out something with the missus. Guards hadn't even noticed. He should be back any day now. Wait a minute. Aren't you Uncle Joey? Didn't you hear, boys? Joseph Lee was killed by a pirate. The name's Admiral Ironsides. Welcome to my crew. Mickey Maison, journal entry 1128. It's been 536 days since I've had contact with any breathing member of the Secret Order of the Patriot, and that would make it approximately 550 days since Sully and I stopped the Copperheads from overthrowing the country or whatever it was they were planning on doing. I mean, see? That's what happens when you've been out of the stopping-bad-guys game for as long as we have. You forget the details, and looks like we've been forgotten, too, 'cause not a word, not a peep, not even a card on my birthday. You figure if someone thinks you're good enough to be knighted into atop-secret government organization you're special, but 1 guess Pm just average. Well, this is Mickey Matson signing off, bored, as usual. Sorry, Gramps. Not a lot of time today, late for school. Just one thing I don't get. Why'd you get me involved with the Secret Order of the Patriot if they don't even need me or want me? Just give me a hint. Put a word in with the boss up there, however that works. I'd appreciate it. Sully? What are you doing here, country boy? Sully! Ah, you punched me in the face. You kicked me in the shin. Yeah, what hurts worse? The face or the shin? You tell me. Whistling You two through horsin' around yet? Grams? Get in the Jeep. You 're lucky she broke it up. How are you, Sully girl? Good to see you, too, Mic key. What's it been, about a year now, right? Try a year and a half. Mickey, the order knows you've been very patient. Here, put these on. What for? Just followin' the rules. Where do you think we 're going? Not sure, but it must be pretty serious with an this cloak-and-dagger business. Yeah, Grams, where are you taking us? Should I have packed an overnight bag? Hey, Sully, keep the lid on. What are you tryin' to do, get me in trouble? I would've at least brought some bug spray. What's going on? You two stay put. Why do I have a bad feeling about this? Welcome to SOP armed security checkpoint. Retina! scanner activated. Please align one eye to center of screen. Ab normality detected. Dang cataracts. SENT-i activated. Please enter access code. Hey did you hear something? Grams, what's goin' on? Access code denied. For the love, what is she doing? Please enter access code. Uh, Grams, I'm not sure you're supposed to be touching that thing. Denied. Targeting intruders. Nice robot. Final attempt. Guys, you better hurry. Just give me the code! What if one of the higher-ups knew that we-- Bouncin' Betty! It's Bouncin' Betty! Target locked. Death imminent. Access code accepted. That was close. You're telling me. Access granted. Gotta love technology. Put on your hoods. Sorry for the false alarm, SENT-i. Be good now. Okay, you can take those things off now. Holy cow. What is this place? For a very select group of kids, this is the happiest place on earth, Camp Lincoln, Secret Order of the Patriot headquarters and training grounds. Who are we? The SOP. Assess, dismantle. Who are these people, the kids ? They're just like you, handpicked by the order to be the next generation of the SOP. If they're just like us, how come they're here and we aren't? Mickey, we had to wait 'ti! that mess you got wrapped up in with the Copperheads died down, and, quite frankly, you aren't old enough. You have been selected in advanced cryptologic linguist unit. Too young, huh? What about these three? I just graduated from Princeton with a degree in astrophysics. There are exceptions, and you two have an exception as well. Someone important asked on ya. Cadet Ariel. Cell phones, please. Welcome to SOP headquarters. ifs amazing. Recruits, listen up. Transport to survival training leaves in 5 minutes. Master Sergeant Stumpwater is waiting on us. Remember your gear. You'll be outward bound for 5 days. Alright, cadets, let's move it. Go on. Mic key. Look at you. Hello, Sully. Oh! Look at you guys. So are we goin' with you guys? Oh, no, not on this trip. The elites are holdin' down the fort. I think there's other plans for the two of you. Good to see ya, Mic key. What's our status? I want to hear the commands. Power cells are charged. Jet boots are hot. AH systems online. Voice command activated. You have clearance, Max. Power up! We're at 10% thrust! Initiate stabilizers. Quantum stabilizers are initiated. Experimental equipment training working with Major Lynch, advanced class. Let's see the landing. Power down. Good work. Let's take him out to the range. Let's get the lead out! Yes, ma'am. Let's go! Mickey Matson? It's pretty cool what you did last year, stoppin' those guys. You mean what we did last year? I'm Vicky. It should be easy to remember, rhymes with Mickey. It does. Well, bye. Are you serious, country boy? Hey, I'm Vicky. Our names rhyme. How absolutely nauseating, ugh. You're Mickey Matson, the hero. Glad you're here. Be good to see if you live up to the hype. Hey, where are we goin'? A little patience, please. I've been patient for over a year now. Well, then a minute more won't hurt you, will it? No, Mickey's gonna wanna be in there a few minutes alone. Trust me. Okay, guys, real funny. Let me out. Hello, Mickey. Swampy;? Oh, I missed you so much. I missed you too. [shots firing What the? That was close now! Watch it! Promise I'll stop blastin' ya if ya sing me a little ditty. We ain't singin' for no leprechaun. Nope. Oh, when the saints go marchin' in, oh, when the saints go marchin' in, how I want to be in that number when the saints go marchin' in. Seamus! Well, we'd be a quartet if Billy was here. Seamus, that's no way to treat our esteemed guests. Some employees you got here, Uncle Joey. They have violated at least-- and I'm talkin minimum-- 13 OSHA guidelines since I stepped aboard this st in kin' boat. Two things, Bobby Lee. First, this is not a boat. It's a ship. Secondly... Call me Admiral or Ironsides or Admiral Ironsides or Your Highness, but never again refer to me as your Uncle Joey! What happened to your face, Uncle Joe-oh, Ironsides? Old Admiral? Not that you're old. If you do, I'll joyfully tie an anchor around your necks and send you straight to the depths to meet Davey Jones himself. Please, let me introduce you to Tesla. Well, hello, Tesla. No, Bobby Lee, that is Martin, our resident genius. This is Tesla. Well, what's it do, Uncle-Admiral? This is the cure, means by which we will implement a new code for humanity. So it makes quite a ruckus, huh? You have no idea. Gramps, this is Sully Braggington. Cool, I've heard a lot about you, mostly that you were dead. You come exactly as advertised. It seems like a rotten thing to do to your grandson, being dead but not really being dead. It sends a mixed message. You got sick, Gramps, and it made sense because your-- The pacemaker, workin' just fine. Truth is I was never even sick. My parents still don't even know you're alive. I understand how you felt. It hurt me to see you go through it, but doing the right thing isn't always easy. Keeping you safe was the right thing to do. Well, let's go for a walk. The world has changed. It used to be if bad guys wanted to hurt someone they'd do it face to face, but not today. Today they hide in shadows, scared of organizations like us, so we went underground, beat them at their own game. When they come out of hiding and want to do our country harm-- Take 'em down. Oh, yeah, baby. It's hard for 'em to prepare for a foe they don't even know exists. Sir, we got a problem. What do you got, Evan? The Lumber Port footage, sir. I have high resolution on my phone. What is this? Security cam from a breakout at the Lumber Port Correctional Facility. That bald guy's a Copperhead. We put 'em away last year. When was this? Last night. Well, technically this morning, but, you know, potayto-potahto. And we didn't see this. Joseph Lee? Who? Admiral Ironsides. Still getting all this digitized into our new system. These all your old sandbox buddies? Yeah, I know him as Joseph Lee when he was a young officer of the Coast Guard. He was impetuous and undisciplined. After he left my charge a tragedy occurred. When tragedy meets poor character, it doesn't end well. A real ladies' man. Last I heard he was in Eastern Europe calling himself Admiral Ironsides. He was pillaging ships in the southern trade routes with a crew of modern-day pirates. His hands... ...is that? A harpoon. Wicked. So how do we get started? Huh? Well, first what we gotta do is get you through initiation. It's important that you two realize that what we do here isn't a game. The stakes couldn't be higher. We uncover new threats every day, and our country is depending on us. Assessment and creative problem solving are skill sets that are essential to what we do. Al! of these critical skills work hand in hand with high-level, interpersonal interaction to fill the most-important single element in the arsenal - Of the Secret Order- teamwork. Congratulations. What is this? And why does it smell like wet dog? I've played capture the ag before. This is nothing like capture the flag. The rally point is about 100 yards away from here. The rest of the team should already be there, got it? We got bogies on our 6. I have an idea. No, we stick to the plan. Our teammates are waiting on us. No, we got this, don't we, Sully? You better be right about this, country boy. Great. This isn't good. Now! Watch it, dude. I'm from Chicago. Maybe we should be enrolled in the advanced class. Yeah? Well, you're in luck. That class is now in session. Any ideas? I had the last idea. Come on. You're not the only one from Chicago. Player eliminated. All hype, no hero. Player eliminated. You guys had us. We never even saw that flanking move coming. Yeah, well, our new recruits decided they had a better idea. Hey, they were pretty good for their first day. You want "pretty good" watching your back on the next operation? No. Mickey, come on. Don't let it get to you. Hey, hey, Admiral. What you got us doin"? Pedaling. Yeah, the pedalin' I get, but what exactly are we doin'? Providing coolant for the Tesla. Don't stop pedaling. At a certain point she's gonna get real bright. This is normal. Just close your eyes and keep peddling. He should close his eye. Always pedaling. Always. Always. Always pedaling. This is curious, Little Brother. Oh! Why they stopping? They must always-- They destroy my machine. They are imbeciles! And moron! I'm aware. That's why we need them. Bobby Lee! This thing's a gettin' rowdy! You must keep pedaling, remember? You provide the coolant. Yeah, but I don't remember you saying nothin' about no gator-sized sparks. Run for your life, little brother! I feel all fuzzy. Stop! The pulse could kill you. Whoa! Steady the patient! Imbeciles! Moron! Well, you're still alive. Well, of course we are. Wait, why wouldn't we be? Hang on, now. What in the name of Jefferson Davis-- Those imbeciles. Ah, ah, ah! Aaaggghhhh! They fry my Dulan motor! Moron! Ah, my baby! My baby! Ooh-ooh! Oh! Oh Oh! The light was energy, an electromagnetic pulse, to be exact. That's why the coolant needed to be pumped manually until the timer hit zero! Admiral! Admiral! North Bay... ...she's dark. You've done it, Admiral. Ya done it! Yeah! We did it! So what are we celebratin'? The world's liberation, mate. That blast fried every electronic device on earth. How's about a speech, Admiral? Aye. Speech! Speech! Speech! Speech! Speech! Speech! Speech! Speech! Speech! Speech! Speech! Speech! Speech! Speech! I dreamed of this moment for almost 10 years. It's a reality because of my friend, Serbian genius, Martin Sekulichick. Today the world will call us villains, tomorrow its saviors, but forever you will be able to declare that you were here when the world-- It's the wife. Hello? No, no I gotta go. I'm busy right now. Okay, I love you, bye. I'm sorry. Bring me the box. Gunner team leader. Gunner team leader. This is gunner team leader, over. Are you there, Admiral? Start the operation now. But that'd be ahead of schedule. I realize that, but we're talking on an electronic device, and that would mean that the Tesla was not successful! It's the imbeciles. They don't pump. They destroy my work. Which part did they destroy? The core, the Dulan motor. Where do we get another one? Admiral, Admiral, I know where to find-- Now you two stay put. Oh, now you gonna start to cry? Don't you be startin' that now. It might serve you well to mitigate that sneezin'. He's like twice your size, and they've had a lot more training. They kicked our butts without even trying, Sully. They were just toying with us. He's right. I'm no hero. Oh, give me a break. No, Sully. Max is the real deal. I'm just as average as I thought I was. So, now what? You're gonna quit? No, I-- You know how you said last year that I have nothing to prove? Well, you were wrong. I have a lot to prove to myself. I think we both do. This is our chance to see if we have what it takes, and like Grandpa Jack says, we're part of a team. They need to be able to depend on us. And inst for the record, I believe in you, Mickey Matson. What was that? Security breach. Get to the safe rooms. Go now! They've taken the training center. Get to the annex! [shots firing Were you going? Oh! Uh-oh! Oh! Battle sticks versus ray guns? It doesn't seem fair, does it? This way! Circle up. Got it! Put 'em down. Drag 'em out. [alarm ringing Where is everyone? Let's find Grandpa Jack. Would someone please turn off that infernal alarm? Alright, the control room is down this way. Most of the kids are out at a camping trip, and Grams and Bettie are older than the hill, so we won't have much trouble there. Is that Lynch? Let's go. Gramps, what in the world? What is she doing? It's Ironsides. We got a message from the Coast Guard just before the raid. North Bay was hit by some massive electromagnetic blast. It can't be a coincidence. Find transportation. Where are we going? Evan said the blast came from Lake Manestee. Find Ironsides. Try and figure out what he's up to. Once you do, call it in. This is a direct line to the Coast Guard. But what about you? I'd only slow you down. Besides, Fm not sure the pacemaker can keep the old heart pumping fast enough. What's up, Jack? Go see your great-grandpa. He's got something to show ya. Bettie, what'd you have to go and do that for? Now I might have to break a sweat. Ya know, this is treason. No duh! But, personally, I like to think of it more as a promotion. Get him outta here, and bring me back those two pimple poppers. Sully, come on. So help me if I get hit by one of those things! Come on, Mickey, go! Come on, run! This Way! Hold on, country boy. Now this is transportation. Sully, this isn't even a road. This thing doesn't need roads. Why do you always get to drive? Do you have your permit yet? No. So where's your great-grandfather, in another cemetery? Are you gonna let me drive if I tell you? Nope. And you are never, ever to look the Admiral in the eye. Ah, Bettie, lovely of you to join us. I was just laying out the ground rules for our future deck swabs. Looks like I've found Ironsides some new recruits. These aren't his recruits. Whatever. You know your grandson and his little girlfriend have somehow eluded my men? Admiral Ironsides will make you pay dearly for that. Hmm. Follow me. So your great-grandfather's a librarian? It was right here. What was right here? Oh my, children, those are quite the costumes. Are you playing dress up today? No, ma'am, I think a painting used to hang right here? Oh, yes, John Cavarda Matson, one of our maritime heroes. We moved him to the basement. Ouch, from hero to basement. Okay, well, could we go down and see it? Oh, no, I'm sorry. The basement is off limits. Only employees are allowed down there. You'd have to make an appointment. We'll just have to come back another time. What are you doing? She ism going to inst let us down there, and she surely ism gonna believe that we're here because an unknown branch of the U.S. government is operating a training facility for an elite group of teenagers, which was recently attacked by pirates, and dozens of lives depend on us finding an old picture in her stinky basement. Sometimes you need to bend the rules a bit, Matson. Another advantage to having your permit. Way to go, Chicago. Did you hear something? If she catches us we're in trouble. Okay, come on, let's hurry. How are we ever gonna find it? There's so much stuff down here. It's a needle-in-a-haystack situation. Actually, does he look familiar? So this is your great-grandpa? Hey. It couldn't have been that easy. Okay, Gramps. There has to be some sort of clue. Do you see anything like a symbol? I got nothin'. Wait a minute. You got that look. The flags on the ships, they're naval signal flags, like each one has a special meaning Like numbers or letters. I don't suppose you know 'em by heart? Not really. Good thing we're in a library. Amy. Amy! Have you seen two kids in costume come by here? It's gotta be in here. Bingo. Okay, there. Okay, so that is seven. Two. And one. And this one is and the second one is "S." And "E." Seven, two, one, It's 721 Rose. It's an address. It's-- footsteps Kids, dress up time is over! This place gives me the creeps! Same building as in the painting? Is this the right address? Yeah. Alright, come on. Welcome, welcome, welcome, ladies and gentlemen, to the official tour of the USS Silversides. Alright, well, she officially launched on August 26, 1941. Her total length is 95.02 meters. She is capable of reaching 21 knots while surfaced and 9 knots while submerged. Speaking of submersion-- That was a gift from my morn! Mommy! Alright, then, who's next? Perfect, Dulan motor. This is definitely Gramps' type of place. Do we just knock? No idea. It's locked. There's a doorbell. Screws missing. Fingerprint scanner. We have the coolest grandparents in the world. You know that, right? Why are there never lights? You seriously need to have a talk with your grandpa about paying electric bills. Dark, creepy warehouse. So your grandpa might be a hoarder. What is this? Don't look at me. Grams is a mechanic. Check it out, some sort of-- I don't know-- Ballast intake, Lexite canopy glass? Maybe this one works? Yeah, Gramps. My whole body is tingling. Attention all available Coast Guard personnel. Anyone near Lumber Port or North Bay with equipment not affected by the power surge... ...we have received a mayday call from the Silversides. I've been told several times this is not a joke. It appears that the vessel has been taken over by pirates. I'm driving. I don't think so. This baby handles like a dream. Okay, maybe more like a nightmare. What's going on? I don't know, but Fm pretty sure he built this out of spare parts from an old washing machine. As speed increases, hydrodynamic lift increases, leaving less of the hull in contact with the water which puts you at the mercy of the surface structure. Oh, what is that weird voice thing? Hello? Who are you? To reduce the turbulence, I recommend to pull up the rear hydrofoil stabilizers. Okay, how do we do that? Blue switch. And Fm not weird. Than ks, Kitten. Good, Kitten. Good kitty. Please don't cal! me Kitten, and I was not built out of spare parts from an old washing machine. I'm a prototype defense craft codenamed Thunder Flay. What's so funny? I had a math quiz today. Back to the ship. Aye-Aye. Ad. There's some cool stuff or gadgets in here. Please don't touch that. Check this out. Those are expensive, and 1 expect you are not qualified to use them. No, check this out. Most on board equipment requires extensive training prior to use. Let's take a look. Have you received extensive training? I don't think so. Exactly like the boat from the security footage. What security footage? Looks pretty piraty to me, and I'm guessing if they see us, we're in trouble. The approaching watercraft is capable of 60-plus knots and is highly maneuverable. You might wanna hold onto something. I remember seeing this in the manual. And it's a submarine? You're holding back on us, Kitten. The submarine function has not yet been tested, and therefore 1 could not offer it as an option. And, please, don't call me Kitten. If you must give me a designation, please use my code name, Thunder Flay. We need to follow them. That boat is fast. We need more speed. We have reached our maximum submerged velocity. But we can't lose them. Grandpa Jack said that the electric blast came from Lake Manestee, so we'll just follow the shoreline and then slip into the harbor. He also said to call the Coast Guard if we need help. And we will. I also highly recommend contacting the Coast Guard. Fm gonna say this one more time. If you so much as graze a hair on his head-- Hold up! Oh, mama. Transpo's here. Let's move it! Move, move, move! If I could feel emotions, I would say that whole experience was quite exhilarating. Thank you for the unscheduled test of my submersible mode. Thermal scan indicates there is only one matching heat signature which places the scarab right-- There! There. That looks like the place. What is it with bad guys and cross bones? This is bad. If we anchor right under the bow, they might not be able to see us. All right. Let's call the Coast Guard. No, Gramps said we have to figure out what Ironsides is up to, not just find them. As soon as we figure out what's goin' on we'll call it in, okay? I promise. I, too, recommend calling the Coast Guard, but what do I know? We looked up to you. Oh, really? Well, I despise you. I'm sick and tired of babysitting you snot-nosed kids, watching you rise up in the ranks while I am stuck here in Nowheresville, and I am done with it. Get out of my face. And I hope you two have gone potty, because I understand an overactive bladder's a problem for you folks? Let's go! So now we need to use that radio, country boy. This is crazy. Uh... I kinda left it in the Thunder Ray. Wow, that can't be good. I'm no genius, but I bet that has something to do with the blast your Grandpa told us about. Someone's coming. Come on. Beauty, Tesla. Nice Tesla. Nice Tesla. What's a Tesla? He was a person. He? Very fragile! You nincompoops, you go now! Hey, Igor, you're gonna need to learn now to communicate in American if you plan on me taking you seriously. No! No! No! You try to be nice to someone. Well, he's a weirdo, and he talks funny. Oh, you're just figurin' that out now. Well, I seen you were tryin' to be nice. I'll tell you what. As soon as I get a chance, I'm throwin' that crackpot overboard. As long as you let me tie him to his Tesla toy beforehand. Explain to me what Uncle Joey--oh-- Admiral is plannin' to do with that thing. That device is gonna electrificationify the earth and fry every electronic gadget there is. So? Like when we's kids, remember? And we used to zap them old bull pond frogs with jumper cables. Yeah, but we used to kill them--oh. Exactly, he's lost his marbles and his 3 cents. Okay, that sounds bad. I know, and I don't even like frogs. So, like, did you hear them? Every electronic device on earth. We have to stop them. But, Mic key, there's only two of us, and don't forget their little ray guns. Green is not my color. Think you can outrun the mad scientist? Any day of the week, but remember we're a team. Looking for this? Oh, hello, dear. So sweet, little girl. Eww, you creeper. May I have it back to me, please? Thank you. No, no, no! I mean, please, to me give it now. Give it now. Give it now. Nah. Bad girl. And here he comes. Evil girl! Evil girl! Come on, let's get outta here. Like yesterday. Well, hello! Aren't you going to even say goodbye? Admiral Joseph Ironsides. I don't think we'll be shaking your hand. Well, spirited young friends, perhaps you might be interested in my other hand. I didn't think so. The Dulan motor? Fine. Seamus, your musket Tesla, if you please. Bring them to the wheel house. What are your names, please? Mickey Matson. Spartacus. I'm curious as to why you'd be sneaking aboard my ship with no adult supervision, no backup, no Coast Guard. I don't know either. Maybe my compadre here could answer that for you. What can you tell me about that wonderful vessel you moored alongside the bow of my ship? It reminds me of an old man! once knew, and then I realized, of course, who else but Jack Bettie? He sent you? He sent children? We're teenagers. Grandpa Jack was right about you. Grandpa Jack? We always dreamed of meeting an heir of Jack Bettie. It's because of your grandpa that we're here today. It was under his command he had me transferred. My wife and daughter were with me aboard my brand-new cutter. She was proclaimed to be the most technologically-advanced vessel on the planet, rumored to be unsinkable. She was crushed by a mere breeze from the East. Every single system failed. We were trapped below decks. I'm sorry you lost your family, but you've gone totally insane. Insane, little girl? All that I do is with extraordinary reason. I tried to get to them, but my hand was pinned against the bulkhead. The only thing I could reach was a harpoon. Technology took everything from me, but today I will push the reset button for the entire world, a new era. Mankind will adhere to a set of regulations that will keep the world on the right path, a simple code of conduct, my young friends, my code, pirates' code. People will die. Everyone who depends on technology will-- It will be tragic. All great events that change the world have their martyrs. They're here, Admiral. Right on time. Gramps! Grams! Looks like your little boyfriend failed again. Have some faith, Max. Lock 'em below decks, Lynch! Let's get 'em on board. You heard the Admiral. Move it. Where are you taking us? Don't you worry about it. Get in there. Ah, ah, back together like one, big, happy family, sadly trapped like rats. Gramps, Ironsides has completely lost it. What do we do? Did you find the Thunder Ray? Yeah, it's at the front of the ship, but it's-- It's fried. Ironsides shot it with one of his funny little guns. The electronics are separated by overloaded diversion systems. We could plug in to the backup wiring harness, but we would need a significant charge to bring the systems back online. Greek to me. How much power would we need? A hundred terawatts. Great Scott! Where are we gonna get that kind of power? What good would it do us? If you haven't noticed, we're locked in an engine room. And they're definitely isn't a rescue party headed our way. Who's there? Show yourself. What are you doing down here? Does the Admiral know you're down here? You're gonna get in trouble. Hey! What's goin' on? Well, I'll be a badger in a bowling alley. My little brother's a superhero. What are you doing here? Lighten up there. We're here to bust you out. What? You're working for Ironsides. Open your eyes, kid. We ain't workin' for no Ironsides. I'd say we's more like captives. Yeah, Uncle Joey's got a wire crossed up in there somewhere. Uncle? That's one sketchy gene pool. Uncle Joey did make me a super hero, though. Okay, so how do we know we can trust you? Well, I can't right do anything for ya, but we need to stick together if we're gonna stop this wing nut and get off of this rig. So how's about it? How 'bout we make Lee family bygones be just that? By and no longer here. Yeah, that. So now what? We take down the bad guys. Yeah, sure, but we're still outnumbered. Oh, come on. Mickey, tell 'em what we're gonna do. I don't know, Sully. I mean, everything I've planned has-- I just don't think you want me to lead this one. What are you talking about? If we let Ironsides fire that cannon up there, millions of people will die, including your grandpa. If that gizmo you have pumping your heart couldn't keep up with us, I highly doubt it will stand a blast from that thing on deck. Is that true, Gramps? Yes. So what do we do? Why do you think I asked you? I'm the motivator. You're the idea guy. Go ahead, Mickey. Today I had a radio that I didn't use. I thought Sully and I could handle this. Just wanted all of you to see that we were ready. That means I wasn't lookin' out for the team. Grandpa Jack says that working together is our most powerful weapon. We need to rely oh each other and lead the enemy into making their own mistakes, use their sloppy attacks against them just like Max did to me in capture the flag. You took an oath when you joined the Secret Order of the Patriot to defend this country against its enemies in the brightest of days and the darkest of nights. Do you remember that oath, or were those just words to you? Because they definitely were not just words to Sully and I. And we can do this if and only if we all work together, and if you guys give us another chance, I promise we'll always have your back. I will. I'm with you. I'm in. Alright. Let's do this. Look out, you dirty pirates. Here comes the SOP. Ah! Look at that. Alright, Max, your call. What's the plan? Alright, Max, your call. What's the plan? First thing we need to do is to take out the guards. Barn! All yours. Okay, go. My faithful band of brothers, many of you are castoffs from our sorely-misdirected society and many years have stood by my side. For years you've worked tirelessly towards our goal. You kept to the code, our code, the pirates' code. Yeah! A code that shall now become the law of the land. Once we fire the Tesla, the world will be our oyster. Yeah! Hello, lad. Don't recall seeing your face before. Ahoy there, Uncle Joey! You are hereby removed from your command by the Secret Order of the Patriot. Boy, t will see you run through with this harpoon! Find 'em! Find 'em all! So, ya wanna play, do ya? Oh-ooh-ooh! Aaahhh! What are you gonna do with that shovel there, boy? Tough talk with for a guy with a gun that doesn't work. Nice try. You must pump, always be pumping. No, no, you stop. No copy teenager. You stop. I go now. Crack! What ya going to do with that thing? Head me a bedtime story? Oh. Do you know what pirates do with the weak? Let 'em go? We make 'em beg for their life. Oh no, you did not just try to hit a lady with that thing! I learned that one from my granddaughter. You kids have no respect. Someone's gotta teach you a lesson. Let's teach her a lesson. Hit him, Jeremiah! Hit him again. Ahh! Hee-ya! Hey, Benedict Arnold! You missed. Not so much. Behind you. Let's go. Nowhere to go now, Mickey, huh? Nowhere to go! Where you gonna run, boy, huh? Where ya goin', boy? [Admiral Ironsides laughing) You should never risk more than you're willing to lose. Unfortunately, you've risked it all. You know, 1 thought my fight was with your grandpa. I see it's really with you, Mickey Matson. Mickey! Jack Bettie, I want you to know the feeling of helplessness that consumes you when you hear those that you love screaming for help, and there's nothing you can do to save them. Mickey, the pry bar! A little fight left, have we? Follow his right, his right. He can't see! By the way who gave the title of Admiral, anyway? Prepare to meet your end, Mickey Maison. Mickey! Did you actually expect to best me, boy? Did you? No... ...but Max does. Yes! Yes! That little storm that sank your ship was a hurricane. Technology didn't fail you. It was your own pride. And as for your pirates' code... ...I'll pass. Hey! Yeah! On your knees, pirates. Admiral, what you doing? It can't handle the charge. You're mad! I will not be denied! When this blows, you, Mickey Matson, will feel my pain as you watch your grandfather buried. The world will know-- You had her comin', Uncle Joey. No! Can you stop it? No, he has supercharged the Dulan motor! She's gonna go boom. Big-time boom. How big is big time? A Trojan-bomb big, 300 terabytes big, ah! What are you doing? I have no idea. I ain't said this since we was knee-high, Brother, but I love you. I love you, too, Bobby. Mickey! Gotta go. Matson! No, Mickey! Stop! Mickey, no! Mickey. Are you crazy? You'll die! If I don't do this, we all die. Hey, Kitten, are you with me? Please don't call me Kitten. Alright, I need your help. We've only got about 2 minutes. Power levels are critically low. Yeah, I know I got a power source. I just need to tell me how to plug it in. Yes, nice. No, no, no, no, no, I didn't get it all. Mickey it's the red wiring harness. Thunder Flay is ready for action. All right. We're goin' for a ride, Kitten. Alright, we've gotta get as far away from that ship as possible. What can you give me? With that power source, the sky's the limit. What? The sky is what? Proceed with caution. We don't have time for caution. Kitten, you can fly? Whoa. What does the blinking Hg ht mean? My autopilot function was damaged by the munition. Now you tell me? My sensors indicate the device in the passenger seat will lose containment in 30 seconds. Okay, we need to get higher. What can you give me? Center console, little buttons. Boom! Mickey! Whoo-hoo! Power down! [all cheering You had me worried there for a minute, country boy. Found these in the Thunder Ray. Way to go, Mickey. This happened to fit just right. You stuck the landing, hero. You still need more training, though. Oh, trust me, I know. Jeremiah! This might be the right time for us to take our leave. I'm telling you, Jack he doesn't even know now to drive. He doesn't even have his permit. How sad is that? Oh, never a better time to learn. Always training for something. I may need a co-pilot. It would be an honor, Mickey. You named it Kitten? Tell me about it. Don't ride the brake, Mickey.
