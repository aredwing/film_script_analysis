Murphy getting zero protection in the pocket from this swarming Cuyahoga defense, but still keeping the Coldwater Black Bears in this ball game. For those of you just joining us, this is the Ohio River Valley Sports Network reporting live from the 1991 Ohio high school football state championship game with the Cuyahoga Raiders taking on the Cinderella story... the Coldwater Black Bears. The perennial powerhouse Red Raiders hail from the big city of Cleveland, Ohio. Their high school has more students than the entire population of the small town of Coldwater. And the big story for Coldwater has been quarterback Scott Murphy, raised by a single mother who works in a factory. He was recently named "Mr. Football" as the outstanding player in the state. This is it, folks. A Coldwater victory here would be a fairy tale ending for this hardworking blue-collar community. just one time out remaining. Coldwater needs a touchdown right here to win the state championship. Scott Murphy, "Mr. Football," deep to return the kick. And he'll take it to the 50, to the 45. Murphy's hit, but he breaks the tackle, stays on his feet, - breaks another tackle... - Come on, come on! ...inside the 35, inside the 30, and he's knocked down at the 26. And he'll quickly call a time out to talk to Coach Hand. This has been one of the great games in Ohio high school football history. here in the fourth quarter. Third down, 42-38. Words exchanged on the sidelines as Murphy appears to be arguing the final play call by Coach Hand. That's the play. Commentator: They seem to have agreed on something. Murphy is headed back out onto the field. He's got one final play to make a miracle happen here in Coldwater. - Crowd: Murphy! Murphy! - Murphy: Black seven! Black seven! Hike! Commentator: Murphy drops back, looks deep. Hall's wide open in the end zone. He's open. He's open. He's open! Commentator: He tucks it. He's gonna run it. (crowd cheering) - Now inside the 20, to the 15... - Run, run, run, run! ...to the 10, to the 5! Touchdown, Coldwater! They will be the state champions of Ohio! Wow. (Murphy screams) (birds chirping) (brace squeaks) (snores, mumbles) I'm never drinking with you lightweights again. Man on shoulder: But you said that last week. Murphy: Yeah, well, I mean it this time. That's it? Ain't no tuck-in, no kiss good night? It's my birthday, Murph. That's why I didn't drop you off at the curb. So your hometown's bringing you down  Or you're drowning in the small talk...  Man: I don't need help. My body-to-booze ratio is enormous. I have the liver strength of 10 men. I'm not drunk. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. I got a sharp pain in my stomach. - What does that mean? - Don't eat three dozen wings. Now come on, man. You know I'm paranoid. - What side's your appendix on? - Your right side. Now get up. That's the side that hurts. Oh, I got appendicitis. No, you don't have appendicitis. You'd lose your appetite. Now let's go. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Murphy, take a look at this. I need you to be the beneficiary of my life insurance policy. - Hell no, Dwight. Hell no. - No, come on, man. If I croak in my sleep, I need to know my mom's taken care of. I got plenty of people I gotta worry about. My brother would put her in a home, man. Please? Thanks, Murph. Hey, we're worth a lot dead, Murphy. If I bite it, you can have some. I know the bank's been riding you, brother. Murphy: Just quit talking and go back to sleep. You're "Mr. Football." And in '91 you sent them packing. Don't sweat it, Murphy. You'll find a way to win. You always did! (sighs) (door creaks) (clatters) (door opens) Murphy: What are they doing up? They heard you drive up. They've been waiting for you to come inside. (commentator speaking on radio) What do you do out there anyway? Just listen to the radio? Yeah, Mace. Just listen to the radio. Hey, so don't forget the bank appointment. Murphy: How could I? You told the whole town. I didn't... I only told Sasha. Mace, we live in "Backwater." You tell one person... you might as well put it up on a billboard. - (machine beeps) - Dispatcher: Signal 50 Coldwater. - (pager beeps) - Units respond to 267 Main Street for an unknown fire to the rear of the building. Signal 50 Coldwater volunteers please respond, - 267 Main Street, for an unknown fire. - Honey. You've been up all night and it's not even your shift. You don't have to go. (siren wails) - (man babbling) - (radio chatter) - What's going on, Gig? Is this it? - Gig: Aw, Jesus, Coach... ...walking down the street, I was barbecuing. - Wham! The whole grill is on fire. - All right, go sit down. Hang on a second. You stay back with me on the pump. Barney, Rodriguez, you guys handle the hose. Murphy: If you're gonna blame me, at least let me fight it. No, I'm not doing that. I just want to talk to you about the halftime ceremony tomorrow. - I watch the station on game day. - Hand: Celina can cover us. Murphy: Celina is 40 minutes away. But, hey, if you don't need me, I got plenty of work I can do at home. Hand: Like what? Babysitting those damn beans? You know, if you planted corn like everybody else, you could just sit back and watch it grow. Charge the line. Murphy: So you're coaching farmers now too? Coldwater's corn country for a reason. Yeah, well, it used to be football country too. What are you, four and six? - Six and four. - Close enough. You know, if that's meant to hurt me, it doesn't. These guys may not be as talented as you guys once were, but I'll tell you something... they play twice as hard and I like them just as much. Yeah, well, you should be seven and three if you'd have hit Taylor on that deep post against Marion instead of bringing in Wilson to kick a 42-yard field goal, and the guy can't hit the broad side of a barn. You know, for somebody who's too busy to come down and watch football games, you sure as hell know a lot about what's going on in 'em. Yeah, well, I don't listen... got 'em playing on the damn radio at the station. You think I don't know where you go on Friday nights, huh? You think I'm blind, can't see your headlights up there on that bluff? Why don't you get your ass out of that truck and down on the field where it means something? It's bad enough to listen to you lose on the radio. You think I want to come down and witness it in person? Think you can do any better? Come on down and coach my quarterbacks. Sure, as soon as you come help me work my back 40. I'll help you plant... some corn. Why don't you worry about your field, and I'll worry about mine? (buzzing) People said you were crazy for growing soybeans here, but they look good to me. Yeah, yeah, looking pretty good. What've you got? Certified mail. Is Sasha around? She took the girls to the park. Just put her stuff on the porch. Oh, wait. One more thing. My mom said that Macy told Joanne Bragden to tell her to tell me to tell you to get a move on... something about "Frank and a tie"? Oh. Man: Mr. Murphy, it's been 120 days since your last payment. Murphy: Frank said we could work something out... something about a "forbearance" till harvest. I filled out all this paperwork. The crop's about 80% right now. It's gonna be ready to harvest real soon. Were you friends with Frank? Yeah, kinda. I played ball with Chris Hall. - Chris who? - The football player who does your ads. Uh-huh. Um, Mr. Murphy, I am... I'm sure that... ahem... Frank thought he was helping you out, but he's actually put you in a pretty bad situation. It's not that bad, is it? To be honest, Mr. Murphy, based on your equity and your employment history, this... this loan should have never been approved. Well, I already got the loan. I just need the extension. It's too late for an extension. The bank's already called in your loan. What do you mean? What do you mean, called in my loan? The power of sale foreclosure proceedings have already begun. Your property will be on the market in the next several days unless... unless you can pay a significant sum here today. I'm a farmer. I can't pay you until my crops are ready. If you can raise something before we get any offers, I'm sure we might be able to take another look. Otherwise I'm sorry, Mr. Murphy. Well, I'm not asking you for a bailout. I can pay you in two weeks, in less than a month. Man: There's nothing I can do. I'm sorry. Okay, ladies, pick your poison. Girls: Operation. Operation. Play this one. (girls whine) Nah... Girl: Look at this thing. (girls chattering) (crowd cheering) Two guys wide open... and you run it, like an idiot. (static buzzes) (groans) (knocking on door) Girl: Daddy? Daddy? Sorry, I fell asleep with the girls. No, that's okay. How did it go at the bank? It went great. - Yeah? - Yeah. What did I tell you? I knew it would work out. Guess who I ran into. Who's that? They wanted to stick around and say hi. (loud music playing) - Oh, there he is. - (music stops) "Mr. Football." Hey, Hall. Hey, Hall? What the hell is that? Hey, Scotty. Nice to see you. - How have you been, buddy? - Good. I send you tickets. I don't see you. I ain't got many years left in me, you know? Oh, hey, we got the Steelers on Monday, but I wanted to get back for the ceremony and see the guys. Check it. (laughing) Oh, yeah. - I don't think mine would fit anymore. - Like a glove. Murphy: Come on, Mace, the girls are next door. We really should get going. Oh, that's right. You have kids. Two. Hey, why don't you guys come for dinner? - I can cook and... - Mace, I'm sure they got plenty of... - No, you could just catch up. ...people they have to see besides us. Come on, we really should get going... the girls. - Okay. - It's good seeing you guys. Yeah. (engine starts) - Hall: Thank you. - No, it's so good to see you guys. - I got it. - Oh, thank you. Hey, we're doing something at Pal's after the game. You'd better be there. See you guys. Great. Yeah. (country music playing on radio) I thought you'd be excited. You were so close in high school. Yeah, well, high school was a long time ago. Are you mad they're together? No. What kind of question is that? You know, if I... if I saw my high school flame with my best friend, I might wonder. Yeah, well, I really could care less. Since when did you have a high school flame? Well, we weren't "class couple" like you two or anything, but if I hadn't fallen for you when you were laid up in the hospital, who knows? Whatever. I'm just saying I wouldn't mind having them over. I think it'd be good. Good for what? So we can talk about how I got laid off when the plant closed down? Or good so they can walk in the den and see the holes in the walls and the plastic covering the windows? If they're so interested in seeing holes in walls and plastic covering windows, they don't have to walk into the den. We've got that right out on the porch. (chuckles) You're crazy, you know that? Now who the hell was your high school flame? Wouldn't you like to know? Murphy: So what, now you aren't gonna tell me? (knocks on door) (door opens) Daddy, can we sleep with you? - (Macy chuckles) - We're cold. Macy: Okay, come on. Girl: Yay. - Girl: Are we going under the covers? - Macy: Come here, sweetie. - Macy: Oh. - Girl: Daddy. Where are you going? - Macy: Honey. - Daddy? Older daughter: Dad? Murphy: They're frozen. The damn beans are frozen. Macy: It's okay. It's gonna warm up, right? No, it's not okay. If we don't harvest today, they're gonna rot off the bush. What are you looking for? The phone book. Where's the phone book? I gotta call Red. - Wait, wait, it's here. It's okay. - We're gonna lose our... we're gonna lose everything. - No, honey, no. We're not gonna... - I can't believe the frost. Damn it. No. Listen to me. We're not gonna lose everything, okay? - You said it was 80%, right? - Yeah. Okay, so we make 80%. We harvest sooner and we get the money to the bank sooner. Yeah. Yeah. - Okay. - It's okay. Okay, I gotta call Red. Okay. The freeze hit hard all over. They've been calling from Illinois to Michigan for one of these... probably the last soy header in the area. Thanks for bringing it so quickly, Red. Hey, no problem. Macy: Thanks, Red. You're a lifesaver. Red: Better get those beans in before the rain gets here or you won't be running that thing through that field. I know, Red. Thanks. Red: Hustle up... you can make the halftime ceremony. (metal groaning) Girl: What was that? (screeching) (engine stops) (mutters) Damn. (bangs) (thunder rumbling) Honey, I heard the noise from the house. Thank God you're okay. I'm not okay. Every cent we had, every penny my mom left us is gone. It's all wasted. Oh, honey, calm down. Calm down? I just broke the last soy header in the state. Well, Red can fix it, I'm sure. Yeah, in two or three days. The beans will be rotten by then. - So we pick them. - Pick them? It's 200 acres, Macy. Don't be so stupid. (softly) Scott... I'm sorry. Just go back inside. I'm gonna go down and see if Red can find me another header, okay? - Mm-hmm. - Okay. (engine starts) (thunder crashing) (rain pattering) Macy: Okay, are we ready? - Girl: Daddy. - Macy: There you are. Hey. Hey. Are you guys ready for the game? Yeah. I tried to call the shop, but I didn't get an answer. They had an extra one at Hoover Heights. Yeah? The rain's not gonna be a problem? No, Red said it's gonna let up any minute. - Okay. - Hey, you guys get going to the game. - Get in the car with Sasha. - Sasha: Come on, guys, let's go. - Don't forget your football. - Are you coming with us? No, I'm gonna meet you guys at the diner after the game. - Youngest daughter: Okay. - Both girls: Bye, Daddy. - You're gonna come when you're done? - Yeah. You guys go on. - I'll meet you at Pal's afterwards. - Okay. Macy: Okay, you guys, come on. (all chattering) Commentator: Coldwater is struggling here on a rainy homecoming Saturday afternoon, down by 14 already in the first quarter, Coach Hand probably wishing some of these players here today were from the 1991 state championship team. Commentator: And everyone is hoping the rain lets up in time for the halftime ceremony to recognize the '91 state champions who won big here on this field 20 years ago. That team was led by Scott Murphy... "Mr. Football." Chris Hall is here signing autographs... (radio off) Dwight: Don't sweat it, Murphy. You'll find a way to win. You always did. Dwight: We're worth a lot dead, Murphy. (door opens) (door closes) (engine starts, roars) (coughing) (birds chirping) (knocking on window) Man: Scotty. What are you doing, man? Murphy: Thank God. I'm such an idiot. Why is it all foggy? Are you making out with yourself in there? (chuckles) What the...? What the hell? Come on. We're gonna be late. Late for what? (school bell ringing) (voices chattering) Hey, Murphy, good game last week, man. Hi, Scotty. Scott Murphy, where have you been? If you guys are gonna skip sixth period, at least tell me. I was waiting around for you like an idiot. Ugh, I'm so mad at you, I could just... I could just... Why can't I stay mad at you? Oh, you guys make me sick. Hall: Hustle up, lover boy. Murphy: What's going on? Am I dead? Hall: We're both dead unless you hurry up. Yo, Murph, hey, check out my new game face. I call it "Fourth Down." Ready? (grunts, yells) Huh? Tough. Pearson, you look so skinny. Hey, I've been working out, man. I got balls. Hey, come on, D, he's just hating you, bro. Oh, I get it. You're just trying my confidence before the big game, right? These guns go bang, baby. Murphy, get in here. Close the door. All right, what happened to you today? Mrs. Bird said you weren't in Lit class... again. No, Coach. (chuckles) I wasn't anywhere near Lit class today. Well, you missing class isn't funny to me, Scott. I don't know why it's funny to you. Sit down. All right, look, I know you've already got one foot out of this town. And a lot of people around here think that whatever you do on Friday night is all that matters. Well, I'm not one of them. I want you to be a man who's good for more than one night a week. If you skip class one more time, Scott, I'm gonna bench you. I don't care if I gotta play a freshman quarterback in the state finals. I'll do it. Coach... you mean we'll play Cuyahoga this week? Is that supposed to be funny too? You know, the Red Raiders got seven all-Americans and one linebacker who thinks you cheated him out of being "Mr. Football." He'd like nothing better than to clean your clock. Get dressed. All right then, suicides if everybody is not on the field in two minutes. Let's go. Let's go. (blows whistle) Let's go, guys. Let's go. Let's pick it up. This is crazy. (whistle tweets) Well, ladies and gentlemen, our quarterback has decided to join us. - You can thank him personally later. - Man: What happened, Murph? - (men grumbling) - What's the matter with you, Murph? Sorry, guys. All right, offense, defense, line it up. - Red 24... let's run it. - Man: Let's go, D. Come on now. - You want me to quarterback? - Scott, knock it off. Get in there and play some football. Hall, what's Red? Is that with you in the slot or...? - That's not funny, man. - Man: Let's go Red. Man: Come on, D, let's do it. Come through, come through. Men: Come on, man. Okay, Red 24. Red 24. - Get off my butt, Murph. - The center's over here, Murph. - Oh. - (men chuckle) Man: Get him this time. (squeals) Down. Set. Hut. Hike. I got him. I got him. There we go. That's twice this year. - Whoo! - (Murphy coughing) Who's skinny now, huh? Whoo! Dwight: Oh, no. No, no, no, no, no. (groaning, hacking) Are you all right? - Man: He was too big, huh? - Man #2: What were you thinking? Nice job, Pearson, you dummy. Hey, are you okay? That one felt real, Coach. Damn right it's real. Keep moving like a pregnant goat, you won't last three downs on Friday night. Cuyahoga hits 10 times harder than Pearson. - Hey. - They want nothing better than to get you out of the game. You're a running quarterback on that play. The pocket breaks down, what do you do? - You... - Move. Move! Come on, let's go. All right, play football. Let's go, boys. (men cheering) That one felt really real. Come on, D. Come on, man. - (men yelling) - Murphy: Okay. Down! Set! Black EG! Black EG! Hike! Whoo, baby! - Whoo! - Dwight: Bite me. - How about that, huh? - Shut up. That's what I'm talking about. Let's play some football. I woke up this morning  And the sun was gone  Turned on some music  To start my day  I lost myself  In the familiar song  I closed my eyes  And I slipped away...  Set. Go. Whoo! Good to see you, guys. Hey, Hall. It's more than a feeling...  Murphy: Yeah, baby. More than a feeling...  - Whoo! - When I hear that old song  - They used to play  - More than a feeling  - I begin dreaming  - More than a feeling...  (whistle blows) Very nice work, ladies. Take it in. Good stuff. Oh, come on, Coach, one more. I'm just getting started. Hey, Hall, give me the ball. Where's Gig? Gig, let's run a post, all right? You haven't had one yet. - No, come on, come on. - That's not funny, Murphy. What's Hall doing? Hey, let's go, baby. - Oh, man. - What? - Snap the ball. - Knock it off, will you? - What? - What's wrong with you? Guys...? Hey, Coach, can I ask you something? No, I don't know if this game's gonna be on TV. The minute I do, I'll let you know. Here. No, it's not that. Have you ever had a dream that you're young again? Sure. Almost every night. Yeah, but what if it wasn't a dream? What if it was real? Well, that'd be something. No, no, no, Coach, I'm serious. This isn't some kind of life-after-death thing. We're standing here. I'm real... you're real. Son, don't make me start testing for drugs, not before the biggest game this town's ever played. (girl chuckles) Okay. Bye. See you tomorrow. Hey, Sasha, wait up. Oh, hey... oh my gosh. - Oh, I'm so sorry. - Sasha: It's okay. - I'm sorry. - What? What? Stop looking. I'm sorry for everything. I... Oh. I'm sorry. Macy! - Sasha: I hate that one. - (Macy giggles) Hey, let's get inside while there's still hot water. Let's go. Murphy: Todd. Hey, want a ride? The last time you offered me a ride, I ended up hanging from a hook in the girls' locker room by my underwear. That was a long time ago. That was last Tuesday. Todd? Stop torturing the dorks. (chuckles) - Murphy: Whoa. - Jenny: Let's talk about how great next year is gonna be. So my dad said that Coach Cooper told the head of the alumni association that you are going to start next year. (chuckles) You know what that means? No redshirt year, so you can go pro sooner. And I'll take extra credits so that I can graduate early and go with you. And I'll just get a TV job wherever you end up playing. I have it all planned. It'll be perfect. What if that plan changes? What if I get hurt? Don't talk like that. You're not gonna get hurt. You're the best. Scotty, you just passed my house. Murphy: Yeah, right. I forgot. So... my parents aren't home right now. And I know how you get tense before a big game, so... I thought maybe... - Uh... - Come on. I can't. Sorry. All right, well, I can wait till Saturday. Oh, and don't forget to tell your mom about the recruiter visit on Thursday. Jenny: Okay. Bye. My mom. (engine stops) Biscuit. Hey, old buddy. Hey. - Look at you. Oh. - (Biscuit whines) (door opens) Stop messing with the dog and go get your dinner. It's getting cold. (softly) Mom... Always late, just like your father. Mom. Whoa. Hey. (chuckles) All right, come on, come on. You're gonna make me late. Let's go. You look so beautiful, Mom. (laughs) Get out of here. Mom, wait. - Why don't you call in sick? - Oh, yeah. - Let's stay in and watch old movies. - Sure, sure, no problem. Hey, skedaddle. Go. I'm late. Come on, Mom. Just please stay. Take the night off. Not until my numbers hit, sweetheart. (engine starts) (whispers) They never did. Yo, Murphy. Hey, what are you doing? I've never really read these before. I could go to all these places... Notre Dame, Penn State, California, Florida. I could go to Hawaii. Hawaii? They suck at football. Besides, you already verbally committed to Ohio State. And hey, do me a favor... stop pissing off Coach at practice. I need you playing Friday night. I mean, realistically I know we're probably gonna lose, but I need to have a good game. You don't think we can win? Read the papers, man. No one does. They're saying we'll be lucky to get off the field in one piece. Are we going running or what? Run? We just had practice. You don't want to run... I don't want to run. I don't know why you like freaking running so much anyway. - (turns on TV) - It helps me clear my head. Whatever. You got a new antenna for this piece yet? Who's faster? Me or you? I don't know. Probably me. Well, come on. Let's find out. Hall: What, you want to race? Till Tessier's farm. Come on, man. I want to know. Do you really think we should overexert ourselves right now? What, are you scared? No. No, man, you know what? I got some trig homework to do, so I think I'm just gonna head out. Go! Sucker! Okay, you beat me. Life's like a road that you travel on  There's one day here and the next day gone  Sometimes you bend, sometimes you stand  Sometimes you turn your back to the wind  There's a world outside every darkened door  Where blues won't haunt you anymore  Where the brave are free and lovers soar  Come ride with me to the distant shore  We won't hesitate  Break down the garden gate  There's not much time left today  Life is a highway  I want to ride it all night long  If you're going my way...  - (beeping) - I want to drive it  All night long...  (school bell rings) Oh, I need to talk to Miss Cunningham about my article. I'll be two minutes. - Hey, Murphy. - Scott. - Here, let me help you. - No, I got it. I got it. - Here. - Thank you. So... do you even know who I am? Um, of course I know who you are. You're the guy who spray-painted the band locker room last year. We spent spring break trying to clean it. Thanks. Next time you get the urge to spray words onto something, could you try spelling them right? You know, maybe bring a dictionary or practice on some paper with your crayons first? She... (school bell rings) Hand: All right, guys, come on in here. Let's take a knee. Okay, a little business first. I got some good news and some bad news. The bad news is we're not gonna be playing in Columbus on Friday night. Players: What? Why? Ohio Stadium went from turf to grass last year. Since Ohio State's playing Michigan this Saturday, we had to sell, like, I don't know, to cover the green fees. We didn't sell enough tickets to use the grass? They offered to let us play there if we didn't bring the band. They didn't want them messing up the field at halftime. We're not playing 'cause of the band? The band's part of our team, Pearson. It's part of our town. If the band can't play there, then we can't play there either. Hall: What's the good news? The good news is we won the coin toss. We're playing right here. That's the good news? No scout's gonna drive out here to "Backwater." Oh, I don't know, Hall. Maybe not quite as many. Guys, we have home field advantage. Yeah, some advantage. Maybe they'll slip on a cow patty. Look, at least let's be honest. The reason we didn't get the field is they think that we're gonna get killed. Hand: I don't know. You might be right. I guess you can get down because somewhere somebody who doesn't even know you doesn't believe in you. Or you could look around and be happy about the fact that you're playing in front of the hardworking people who live here... you know, be a little grateful that those same people who do believe in you and can't afford a fancy hotel room in the city can now come out and actually watch your sorry ass play. Line it up. (distant whistle blows) Hey. (chuckles) I was watching you practice back there. I never really knew how complicated those moves were, like running for a touchdown and playing music at the same time. No one's trying to tackle you. I don't know. That drummer got close a few times. Murphy: You're good. I'm surprised. Um... thanks, I guess. - Hey. - Hey. Scotty, man, good luck Friday at the game and all that. - Will you be at the diner tonight? - Uh-huh. - I'm gonna come over with my folks. - Yeah. Boy: Yeah? Yeah. Make sure you sit in my section. Boy: Yeah, I will. Cool. Macy: Yeah, okay. - Macy: Great. - Bye. Scott. - Boy: See you. - Macy: See you later. Is that your high school flame? Why do you care? I... I thought you worked at the hospital in Celina today. The hospital is volunteer and the diner pays, so I... how did you know I worked at the hospital? Small town. Hey. We gotta go to work. Let's go. - All right. - Okay. - See you. - Macy: Yeah. Dwight: Gig's mom called Psychic Friends yesterday, said they thought we might score a touchdown. Where? At Ohio Stadium? Oh, right, we're not playing there. I just need to have a good game, which I can't do unless you do. No pressure. I'm sure you will. Hall: I hope so. The last thing I want to do is spend the rest of my life here in Backwater doing this stuff. - I'd freaking kill myself. - (forklift beeps) (men shouting) - Hey, Mom. - Hmm? If you had a chance to do it all over again... your whole life... what would you do? I don't know. Finish high school. (laughs) No, I'm serious. You would probably get a different job, right? Live in a different town, work less hours? No, my job is fine and so is this town. Would you please just eat your dinner? What's the matter with you? What about Dad? What about him? Would you still have married him? What are you talking about? Would you still have married him, you know, even if you knew it wasn't gonna work out? (exhales) Of course. There's a  Moon out tonight  Let's go strolling, there's a  Girl in my heart  Whose heart I've stolen, there's a  Moon out tonight...  - (tires screech) - Yo, Jeanette, you never called me. Jeanette: Pearson, please just leave me alone. All right, I'll call you later. There's a glow in my heart  I never felt before  There's a girl at my side  That I adore  There's a glow in my heart...  Hey, White, where the hell do you think you're going? The library is that way. Guys, this is a public venue and I've got the legal right to be here under Civil Code section 47... Sorry, freshman, you were banned under the penalty of extreme bodily pain. You know what? That's cool. You know, I really... I wasn't even that hungry anyway. And I was just coming in for a sundae. I'm gonna go. - What's going on? - Oh, no. Todd the Rod tried to break the ban. Listen, I wasn't sure if that applied to all nights or if it was just a weekends thing, but now I know. Who banned him? Who the hell banned him? You did, man. Oh. Yeah, well, he's unbanned now. He's helping me out with something, so leave him alone. Let's go, Todd. - See you, ladies. - Dwight: Wow. (bell dings) Sasha: Yo, 86 chicken fried steak. Girl: Hi, Scotty. - Hey. - Hmm? Right here. Man: Make that milkshake extra wet. You seriously want to eat with me? Murphy: Yeah. Get what you want. If I remember correctly, you get free ice cream. Uh, no. I can't. I'm allergic to milk. If you're allergic to milk, why would you risk your life coming here for a sundae? Sasha: Move it, pixies. We're working here. Todd: Well... Sasha: I need two fries on a rail. You like Sasha? What? No. No. That's crazy. At least you don't have to worry about any competition. Hey, Sasha. Sasha: Shut it, lawn jockey. You're not in my section. Hey, what are you doing, man? Sasha: Beth, your section is bugging me. Take care of them. The direct approach does not work with her. I promise you, your way is gonna take at least 20 years. - Sasha. - No, no, no, please. - Sasha. Sasha. - Please don't. Don't. I didn't come here to talk to her. Well, then why the hell are you here? I don't know. Just... just to watch her, I guess. Listen, I heard that some of the diner girls go to Butler Pond and skinny-dip after work. Yeah, well, Martha Lotte and Beth Lane would take it off for anybody. - No, not them. - Who? Sasha? Yeah, her and Macy Edwards. What? Look, I'm into Sasha, but if you want in, I brought binoculars. I heard some of the band guys talking. They said that Macy has really nice... (tray crashes) - (applause) - I'm sorry. - Man: Smooth move. - Macy: You guys doing all right? (girls, boys giggling) Girl: Oh my God. Boy: Psych. See? I told you. They're just sitting there. Macy doesn't skinny-dip. Let's get out of here. I feel stupid sitting here spying on them. Wait. Wait a minute. My God, they're coming off. What? (engine starts) (girls yelp) (laughing) Macy: Okay, you can turn around now. Boy: This is so awesome. Whoa. Boy: Is that Scott? What are you doing? - Put your clothes on. - But we were just... No buts. Get your clothes on and get out of here before I call your parents. - Sasha: Hey! - Now. Go. - Boy: Relax, man. - Macy: Norman. - Macy, what are you doing? - Uh, swimming. You're naked, for God's sakes. Uh, yeah, that's how you skinny-dip, meathead. Macy Elaine, get out of this water right now and put your clothes on. - What, are you, the swimming police? - Hey, you, shut up. Macy, come on. Sasha: What am I supposed to do... just get out naked? No. God, please don't. (car engine starts) - You could catch a cold out here. - Okay, I got it. Not to mention it's a school night. Macy: Come on. Is this what you do in your spare time... get naked together? What the hell are you doing here? What the hell are you doing here? That's none of your business. It's none of my business? You show up here yelling, you scare our friends away, and it's none of my business? Yeah, well, I happened to be sitting with my friend Todd... happ... Todd, get out here. Todd, get out here now or you die. Hi. Hello. Hello. Hi. Todd... Sasha. Sasha... Todd. I... I sat behind you in Civics. You always came in at the bell because you had gym right before and you had to shower. You never had any makeup on so I could always see your freckles. And your hair was always wet, kind of like now. So since when do you hang out with this bonehead? Oh, I... you know, I don't even know this guy that well. You know, I was helping him with some schoolwork. We were just studying. With binoculars? You know what? He likes Macy and he was afraid that she might be skinny-dipping. What? He likes Sasha and was spying on her at the diner. - No, I think you were spying on Macy. - I wanted ice cream. - I wanted some ice cream too. - You're lactose-intolerant. - (guys scream) - (girls laugh) Murphy: It's freezing! I thought you were supposed to be a big, tough football guy. I thought you were supposed to be an innocent little band girl. - You learn something new every day. - Now is this supposed to be fun? Because I feel like we're all gonna get hypothermia. Sasha: Oh, relax. You'll get used to it. (Todd yelps) Oh, my. Sasha: I like your binoculars. They're really cool. Macy: Take your time drying those... so they can talk. Sasha: Can I have these? I'm playing football again. Oh. I didn't even know you'd stopped. It's all I've ever been good at. That's good. Seems like you really enjoy it. More than you could ever know. It's what's gonna get me out of Backwater. "Backwater"? You make it sound like it's a prison or something. Don't tell me that you don't want to get out of here someday. No. I love it here. Why? What's there to love? So many things. Butler Pond. Skinny-dipping? Yes, skinny-dipping. No, not just that. In the winter, you know, when it freezes over and they have live music and everyone's out there ice skating. Oh, I love that. I go out there and I just feel like I'm living in an old painting. This town is small enough that you feel like you're one giant family, but... it's big enough that someone you thought was one way... is entirely different once you get to know them a little. And that's what I love about Coldwater. Things are gonna be different now, Macy. I'm going to college. And I'm gonna play football. When I go pro, they're gonna pay me a lot of money. Hmm. That's great, good for you. No, not just good for me. It's good for you. Macy, I can take you with me. I can get us out of here. Do girls really fall for that crap? Here. Ugh. Gosh, I guess you get used to it. What? Used to what? Everything coming so easy. Nothing in my life has ever come easy. What do you want, Macy? You want to live out of a trailer, barely scraping by here in Coldwater the rest of your life? I'm... who cares where I live? And you know what? If I do, God forbid, end up in a trailer, then I'm sure I'm gonna be a lot happier than you are in some big mansion. Hey, I wouldn't bet on it. - Sasha: See you. - Sasha, can we go? Murphy: In fact, I'm pretty positive we're gonna be quite miserable. - Sasha: Loser. - Wait. Wait. I'm not with him. I mean, we're not really friends. Murphy: Todd. (car doors slam, engine starts) Murphy: Who the hell does she think she is? I mean, besides, I have the prettiest girlfriend in town, in the state... Jenny. She's beautiful. She's smart. She's amazing. She's... she's coordinated. You know, we were naked in the same water. All I've ever wanted to do was play football. And now I have a chance to do it again and I'm not giving it up. That means the water that touched her naked touched me naked. I'm getting out of here, Todd. I don't care what it takes. (school bell rings) So what do you want to do? Well, maybe we could get some ice cream. I don't know. Red 18! Red 18! Hike! - Argh! - (whistle blows) Murph, man, what the hell just happened? - Man: Come on, Gig. - Why the hell did you throw it to me? You don't never throw it to me. Man: Relax, Gig. You'll catch one someday. Since when does he start throwing it to me, man? I signed up for the ladies, not to get hit. - Hey, Mom. - Sit down. Sit! Is everything okay? I put in 14 hours last night, only to be woken up by Todd White's mother telling me how you are tormenting her son now and keeping him up all hours of the night. Is that right? - Well, it wasn't quite like that. - I don't care what it was like. I raised you better than this. You're grounded, buster. - I'm grounded? - Oh, this is funny to you? You are grounded, do you hear me? - Hey, Thelma. Sorry I'm... - Grounded. - Listen, I'll come right back. - No, no, no. Actually, I'm done. It's your turn. Maybe you can talk some sense into him. I doubt it, but I'll try. You'd better do more than that, or you're both grounded. All right, what did you do? Nothing. - (car engine starts) - What's this? Double-shift Wednesdays. Since you're grounded, I don't think you got anything better to do. I forgot we did this. All right. Hey, hey, hey, hey. They're both for you. I'm pretty good at opening those myself and usually one at a time. All right, grab some plates. - How did it go with Crystal? - Oh, it was great. We talked her out of her depression and back into her rut. (audience laughter) Coach Cooper said I could start next year. That means I can go pro sooner. Finish school. I can finish school when I retire. I just gotta start making money so my mom could quit working so much. I got my full ride out of here. I just want to make sure I get her out of Backwater too. What have I told you about that, huh? This town raised you. Now show it some respect. It's Coldwater with a "C." I'm just saying I could get her out of here. And I could get you out of here too if you want. I'm fine right where I am. No, I'm serious. I could ask Ohio State to hire you as offensive coordinator or quarterback coach. (chuckles) Well, I appreciate that, "Big Time." Really I do. But the truth is Ohio State's already offered me a job. What? When? Hand: Well, let's see... '83, when they wanted Yeager and then '84 when we won the sectionals and, yeah, pretty much every year since then. How come you didn't take it? Eh, they got plenty of coaches at Ohio State. Did you finish all your homework tonight? Forget about it. You know, when I was your age I really was just like you. I couldn't wait to leave this town. Then when I finally did get out, saw what I saw and did what I did, well, I... I couldn't run back here fast enough. You know, Scott, this little town really is special. One day I hope you realize that. See you tomorrow, son. (school bell rings) Game's gonna be on TV, boys. The "Sports Illustrated" guy came in this morning. Macy: Would you sign the petition? It's for the band. Oh...! Oh my gosh. Oh. Boy: Look out. Macy: I am so sorry. Um, hey, while I have you, would you sign? It's for the band. Drop dead. Macy: Hey, thanks. - I've got it. - What are you doing? Oh, it's just a petition... you know, trying to save the band. How many do you have? I have four. What, pages? No. No, like, people. The band's not quite as popular as football, so... Oh, thanks. Hey, save the band. Save the band. Everybody sign this. - Girl: Save the band. - Murphy: Save the band. Everybody pass one around, sign it. The football team can't play without the band. - Boy: Scotty wants us to save the band. - Take one right there. Sign it. Pass one around. You guys got one right over here? Hey, there's some more. Pass them around. The football team can't play without the band. - Thank you. - Yeah. Jenny: Scotty. What are you doing? Come on, let's go. Great. Thank you. (crows cawing) Hand: And because of that, they've got the number one secondary in the nation. Eight of their starting all have full rides to D1 schools. For all intents and purposes, guys, you're playing a college team Friday... a pretty good one. And they hit hard. They're gonna try and do everything they can to get Scott Murphy out of the game. It goes without saying, boys, we've got to protect our quarterback. (light switch clicks) But it's gonna be our field. If we play together, I think we can beat these guys. Now go home, tell your parents you love them, and get some sleep. What about practice? That was practice. (players murmuring) Thelma: Oh, here you go. So I heard Penn State and Notre Dame are still coming around. I hope you're still excited about being a Buckeye. Yes. I'm definitely going to Ohio State. I want to be close to my mom. Jenny: Aww. Well, let me just thank Thelma now for keeping her son close to home. You don't have to go nowhere for me. Go where you want to go, okay? Yeah, but don't you want him in Columbus so you can come see him play? She doesn't watch his games. She's never seen him play. You've never seen him play? - Huh-uh. - She works nights. Well, Thelma, you gotta come see him play, 'cause he will make you so proud. I'm already proud of him. Pass the pepper, please. Whew. Thank your mom for me again, would you? Yeah. Do me a favor, take it easy on Cuyahoga tomorrow night, all right? Some of those guys are gonna be your future teammates. I was kind of hoping they would take it easy on me. Yeah, me too. Listen, your linemen... they play hard. They do. They... and they play with heart. But, son, they're not gonna be able to protect you worth a damn tomorrow night. Yeah, I know. Listen to me. We are sold on you. We don't need to see you play any more football. And if you want to sit this game out tomorrow night, we're not gonna fault you for it one bit. Thanks again. And whatever you decide, good luck. Thanks, Coach. Jenny: I can't wait for us to get out of here together. (rooster crows, cows mooing) (mooing, chickens clucking) Hey, Macy. What are you doing here? My dad will kill you if he sees you. I really need to talk to you. It's important. Okay, just come in here. Thanks for helping with the petition. Pretty much the whole school signed it. So I guess we're even? For the band room? Yeah. So... what's so important? Us. What...? What are you talking about? You have a girlfriend. Yeah, but I don't marry her. I marry you. You marry me? You don't even know me. I do know you, Macy, better than you can ever imagine. Come on. Did your friends put you up to this? Because it is not funny. (huffs) Your grandma had a cabin in Manns Choice. You two had a game... so that if you make your wish, you roll it up in a piece of paper and you put it in the wall... all your wishes come true. Every year, you wished for the same thing. When you were 14, she passed away. And when they were tearing the place down you came back and you looked in the walls and all your wishes were gone. I know what you wish for, Macy. You wish that one day you could buy this farm that you and your parents work on. Macy, your wishes come true. We end up getting married and we buy this farm. And we have two little girls named Krista and Jamie - that we named after your aunts. - Why are you doing this? We end up together because I get crippled in the game tonight. - Stop it. - But I'm gonna change things. If I don't get hurt, in a few years I'm gonna be making money and I'll finally be able to take care of you. Stop it. Just stop talking and please leave me alone. Macy, stop. We tried your dream, okay? And it didn't work out. And I'm not gonna end up here in Coldwater with a bum leg, a rundown farm and two kids I can barely support. I'm not doing it again. I'm not asking you to. All I'm asking is for you to try my dream. Come to Ohio State with me next year. What are you talking about? We were an accident. We weren't supposed to end up together. What I'm saying is, it doesn't have to be like that. Relationships aren't accidents. They're decisions. And if you made one that you're not happy with, then that is called a mistake. So maybe you're better off without it. Macy? Have a nice life, Scott. I hope you find what you're looking for. Macy. Girl: Yeah, all right, I'll let her know. Boy: Good luck tonight, Scotty. Hand: There you go. Thanks a lot. - Hey, Coach. - Hey, Scotty. I have a history class. - This is important. - Well, so are they. - This can't wait. - (school bell rings) All right, quickly. What is it? I can't play tonight. Oh, no. Did you hurt yourself? What did you do? No, not yet. - You're not hurt? - No, I'm not hurt, but if I get injured, I could lose my scholarship. You're not playing because you're afraid you might get hurt? Come on, Coach. We're too small to be playing these guys. Everyone knows it. Even you said it. Oh, well... what the hell has happened to you? Two weeks ago, if I had told you we were playing the Cincinnati Bengals, you'd have felt sorry for them because of the beating you thought you were gonna give them. And now you're telling me that we're too small, so you're quitting? I have to. Well, what is it you want from me? "That's fine, I understand, son. The team will be great"? I'm not throwing my life away for some high school football game. Coach, come on, I have a future. Do you know what the future is, Scott? The future is just a bunch of what you do right now strung together. And right now all you're doing is giving up. And trust me, there's no future in that. Scott... I hope you don't give up this easy in life, because it gets a hell of a lot harder than football. Dwight: They're here. Dwight: Lord, look at the size of their linemen. That's a quarterback. That is their lineman. Dwight: Oh, jeez, they're all that big. Have fun with them tonight. Damn. (sizzling) Jenny: Your Ohio State jersey. (chuckles) Do you like it? Yeah. I do. Thanks. Stop worrying about it. If there's even a remote chance that you'll get hurt, don't play, end of story. I know. I just feel like I'm letting the whole town down. Forget about right now. Think about your future, okay? I know you, Scotty. All you've ever wanted is to take care of everybody, right? - Right. - Okay, so when you go pro, you'll have enough money to do that. No more night shifts and double shifts for your mom, no more trailer. You can get her a real house. - You're right. - Mm-hmm. You should get used to that. (both chuckle) (crowd cheering) - Murphy: Sit down. I bought you dinner. - Thelma: Are you crazy? - Sit down. - I don't have a lot of time. Yes, you do. You have plenty of time. Wait, wait, don't you have a game tonight? I'm not playing. You're not? Things are gonna be different now, Mom. From this point on, I'm gonna be taking care of you. No, you just take care of yourself. I'm fine. No, I'm serious. Next year, I can start living cheaply. I'll start sending you some of my scholarship money. No, you save your money. I don't need it. And the truck... I mean, it's a beautiful truck, - but why don't we sell it? - (laughs) - I can get a ride or run to school. - Sell it? I just bought that truck. - You can buy yourself a new car. - I don't need a new car. And I don't need you telling me how to manage my money, so lay off. I don't need it. It's a waste. Hey, some people spend their money on fancy trips. Some people go gambling. I like to spend my money... and I ain't got much... on you. You didn't have a lot growing up and you never complained, so I want you to have something nice, okay? And that truck is gonna take care of you for a long time, so just stop this talk. "Sell the truck." I'd rather you buy something for yourself, take a vacation or something. Things don't make me happy. Vacations don't make me happy. You being happy makes me happy. I am gonna be happy. And things are gonna be different. Gonna be? What is so wrong with right now? What if this is all you get, kid? What if this is it? It just... it just seems like nothing is ever enough with you, you know? And if you can't be satisfied with what you got, then you're never gonna be happy, no matter what you get. You asked me before if there was something I wish was different. If there was one thing I could change, that would be it. I just want to make you proud of me. You want to make me proud? Make yourself proud. And I'm not talking to "Mr. Football" here. I'm talking to Scott Murphy. Ahem... Sorry I'm late. Get dressed. (players cheering) Commentator: Hello, everybody, and welcome to the Ohio State championship football game. This is a true David vs. Goliath story. There are 2,700 people in the blue collar community of Coldwater, Ohio, all packed into this small-town stadium to watch their home team face off against the defending state champion Cuyahoga Red Raiders... a team from a high school with more students than this small town's entire population. I know that all week long you've been talking about losing, thinking about losing. Some of you are wondering if you should even be playing in this game. Hell, there's probably an accountant somewhere thinks a school our size isn't worth it... I mean, we don't have a chance. Those guys over there think we don't even belong on the same field, but somebody thinks they're worth an air-conditioned tour bus. I want you to go out there tonight and show everybody it isn't the size of your bodies, the size of your buses or your school that matters. It's the size of something else that wins football games. - One, two, three... - Team: Coldwater! (crowd cheering) Announcer: Now taking the field, the Coldwater Black Bears! - Hall: Ready to make history? - Change it at least. After the game, you're mine. Jenny: Go Bears! Whoo-hoo! (cheerleaders chanting) Let's do this. Come on, let's go. - Coach: One, two, three... - Cuyahoga: Red Raiders rule! Commentator: Jablonsky, deep to return in the white jersey and the red pants. And he'll take it right side at his own goal line. He's up to the five with a wall, to the 10, to the 15, to the 20, to the 25, 30, Do you believe it? This isn't what Coach Hand wanted to see. That is going all the way. Touchdown, Cuyahoga! Wow! Right there. Good job. Commentator: Coldwater's shocked with that Jablonsky kickoff return. They're down seven-zip. - All right, let's get that right back. - And the story here tonight is Scott Murphy. He has carried this small-town team against all odds into the state finals against the five-time state champion Cuyahoga Raiders. (Murphy shouting commands) Black-18! Hike! Commentator: Got a man open... and hit hard! - (whistle blows) - And the pass is incomplete. Felt that one, didn't you, Backwater? It's gonna keep coming. It's gonna keep coming. Murphy got absolutely rocked on that play. and lit him up like a Zippo lighter. I'm gonna break your neck, Backwater. Hike! (panting) Commentator: Scott Murphy has almost zero protection in the pocket from the swarming Cuyahoga defense. Slowing down, huh, Backwater? Murphy: I thrive on pain. Willard: I hope so. It's coming all night. Good job. Hike. (whistle blows) Another late hit by the Raiders' defense, this time on number 81 Chris Hall. What did I tell you? That's exactly what I said. Commentator: The Red Raiders seem to be bent on taking Scott Murphy out of this ball game. Commentator #2: They haven't taken him out, but they've certainly contained him. Commentator #1: And Willard is making the case that he should have been "Mr. Football" here in the great state of Ohio. (yells) - (whistle blows) - Get off him! Commentator: Scott Murphy rocked again. It's got to be hard for this hometown crowd to watch their star quarterback taking this kind of beating here tonight. - I can't listen to this. Turn them off. - And the only thing preventing... ...the Raiders from running away... - I can't listen to this. - Turn them off! ...with this ball game are the penalties, late hits, and personal fouls. (grunts) Cheerleaders: Let's go, Bears! Red Raiders on three! - One, two, three... - Red Raiders rule! Caught by number 9 Kelly for another Cuyahoga first down. And that is another Cuyahoga touchdown as the Raiders pull even further ahead of Coldwater. Right now Scott Murphy has got to be wondering what he can do differently to change the course of this ball game. Turn it up a notch. Use your quickness. Now come on, Scott, you're better than these guys. You're better than all of them. Commentator: Coach Hand on the sidelines trying to light a fire under Scott Murphy. Willard: It's gonna keep coming. Hike. (crowd cheering) Yeah! All right. Commentator: I don't know what Coach Hand just said to Scott Murphy or what he was thinking about on the sidelines, but he came back in this ball game ready to prove something. (crowd cheering) Touchdown, Coldwater! Commentator: Coldwater is still in this ball game! The score is 14-7. (workers cheering) (crowd cheering) Yeah, baby. That's what I'm talking about. Hey, man, cheer up. The Raiders are the best team in the state. It's happening again. Control the whole game. We gotta get ahead. We gotta get ahead. Get out there. Get out there. Yeah, boy. And Coldwater trails 21-14 as they head into the locker room for halftime. (rimshots rapping) Gentlemen, some players have talent. Others have heart. But tonight I've seen players with talent who I didn't know had any and others with heart who I thought only had talent. The quality and standard of your life will not be determined by how well you play football, but by how well you confront adversity... attitude. Gentlemen, if you keep playing like this, I promise you you will leave this field winners. Get in here. (players cheering) - One, two, three... - Coldwater! Hand: That's what I'm talking about. Scott... you know I've never seen you play like this. I'm doing the best I can, Coach. Yeah, but don't forget you got 10 other players with you. You don't need to do this all by yourself. You didn't carry this team here. You led them. And they might not be the biggest and the best players, but they're farm boys. Lean on them. They won't break. Come on. (cheering) Yeah, okay. Let's get it going, son. - Put Gig in. - What? You want me to use my team. Put Gig in. You want me to pull out a good receiver and put in one who can't catch? No, just add a fourth and spread them out. If I put in a fourth wide out, son, that's gonna be one less body protecting you. Yeah, I know. Let's go. (crowd cheering) Gig. Get in there. Get in where, Coach? In the game? Somebody get hurt? Nobody. Get in there. Commentator: Gig Bird, number 2 in for Coldwater. Not sure what the plan is here with Bird... zero career yards, zero receptions. - Get open, cowboy. - What are you talking about, Murph? - Changing history. - What did he say? - On one, on one. Ready? - Team: Break. (crowd cheering) Lineman: Hey, back up, back up, G. What are you doing, man? Murphy: Black EG! Commentator: Murphy under center, huge play. Short drop. Here comes the rush. He steps up and throws to Bird. And the pass... is gonna be dropped. Wow. Gig has to catch that ball up at the 27. - All right, all right. - What the hell are you doing? - He was open. - Yeah, he's always open, but we never throw it to him because he can't catch. How do you know he can't catch if we never throw it to him? He's right, man. I ain't never caught one. Well, we're about to change that. Red 33, Red 33. On one, on one. - Ready? - Break. Red 33! Red 33! Hike. Oh. Commentator: Murphy with a perfect pass to Bird who was wide open. Just tell me you know what you're doing here. Using my team, Coach. Hand: You got three other receivers out there. Hall: All right, come on, man. Amateur night's over. Just give me the ball so we can get a first down. - Yeah, man, don't throw it to me. - Don't worry, it's not coming near you. Good. 'Cause I play my best as a decoy. See, I got them fooled. I got them right where I want them. Keep the ball away from me. Red dog six. On one, on one. - Ready? - Break. Commentator: In the shotgun, third and 10 from their own 20, four lineups. Murphy needs a big game here. The ball is snapped. Murphy back to throw. Short drop, looks over the middle. The pass is gonna be... caught... by Bird for a first down at the 35! (cheering) Commentator: What a catch... by Bird! And the crowd loves it here in Coldwater, Ohio. Look at Gig. They know how big - that throw and catch was... - I caught one! I caught one! ...for Coldwater. All right, if Gig can catch one, we can win this game and get home in one piece. Rodriguez, it's your turn. We're gonna run the reverse with you. - I want to send you around the corner. - What? What about Willard? Don't worry about Willard. I'll take care of him. Boys, I want to get as far ahead of them as possible - before the fourth quarter. - Why didn't you say so? Hell, I thought we were just trying to eat the clock. Murphy: All right, Rodriguez reversed on one. Team: Break! Willard: Going down, Backwater. Murphy: Blue 38. Hike. Commentator: Murphy to Rodriguez on the reverse... the old "dipsy-do." Rodriguez around the corner. Murphy lays out Willard. And Rodriguez scrambles for another 10. Coldwater first down. All right. Hey, Willard, it's Coldwater... with a C. Scott, 27 boot. All right, 27 boot on one, on one. - Ready? - Break. Willard: Let's go, defense. Red seven. Hike. (crowd cheering) (cheering) Commentator: Touchdown, Coldwater! Yes! That's it. Attaboy. Attaboy. Jeez! We're in this thing. We're in it. Commentator: And the Coldwater defense coming together with a big stop on third down, forcing the Red Raiders to settle for a field goal. And it's blocked! The field goal is blocked by Moss! It's blocked by Moss! Murphy starting things out here in the second half. And now Coldwater has a chance to pull ahead for the first time in this ball game. (screams) Get your head in the game! This is a state championship! Black razor. Black razor. Down. Set. Black 16. Black 16. Hike. (crowd cheering) Commentator: That's gonna be caught! That's a touchdown, Coldwater! And this hometown crowd is going crazy as Coldwater has taken the lead. Can you believe it? Murphy: We did it. We changed it! Whoo! (bell rings) - (buzzes) - Thelma, what the hell are you doing? My job. What the hell are you doing? - Your shift is up. - No, it's not. - Are you gonna argue with me? - Yeah. I need the hours. Okay, you got the hours, but your shift is done. Now get out of here. - Get the hell out of here. - All right, all right. (cheering) Commentator: First and 10 for Coldwater. They can smell a state championship trophy and a huge parade in that small village of 2700. Cuyahoga is out of time outs. All Murphy needs to do is get a first down here to run out the clock and they will be the state champions. Come on, man, what are we running? I-right, Z-motion, - On one, on one. Ready? - Break. Murphy drops back. Here comes the blitz. Murphy slips the tackle, rolls left, scrambles out of the pocket, looking down the field like he's gonna throw it. Hall's double covered. Rodriguez looks open... And he's hit. He fumbles the ball, picked up by Scotty Hamlin at the 40, Do you believe it? Touchdown, Cuyahoga! And it looks like Murphy is down on the turf back at the 48. Murph, are you all right? Commentator: There is no way this team comes back if Murphy can't get up and back into the ball game. Hand: Let's see if we can get him up. Easy now. (crowd cheering) Hand: Get out of the way. Commentator: And the big story for Coldwater has been quarterback Scott Murphy. Raised by a single mother who works in a factory, he was recently named "Mr. Football" as the outstanding player in the state. And the extra point is good. Cuyahoga now leads by four at the tail end of this ball game. And Coldwater will need a miracle touchdown to win it. Are you all right? Are you good to go? - I'm okay. - Are you sure? Yes. All right, run the clock. Work the sidelines. Commentator: Cuyahoga heading out to kick. And it looks like Murphy is getting into the game to receive for Coldwater. This is it, folks. A Coldwater victory here would be a fairytale ending for this hardworking blue collar community. just one time out remaining. Coldwater needs a touchdown right here to win the state championship. Scott Murphy, "Mr. Football," deep to return the kick. And he'll take it to the 50, to the 45. Murphy's hit, but he breaks the tackle, he stays on his feet, - breaks another tackle... - Come on, come on! ...inside the 35, inside the 30, and is knocked down at the 26. And he'll quickly call a time out to talk to Coach Hand. This has been one of the great games in Ohio high school football history. here in the fourth quarter. Third down, 42-38. Words exchanged on the sidelines as Murphy appears to be arguing the final play call by Coach Hand. - I'm not running the bootleg. - What? I'm not running Black Seven. I'm not doing it. Son, we got 30 yards to cover in one play. We're not running the ball. I know. I'm not running Black Seven. I'm not doing it again. We're not running Black Seven, okay? Let's go Red 24. Hit Hall or Rodriguez in the corner. Wait, Coach, you want me to throw the ball? Yeah, that's the play. Let's get to the line of scrimmage. If you don't like something, change it, audible. Coach, what? Scott, whatever happens, it's your choice. Come on. - What are we running? - I changed it. Changed what? Everything. (crowd cheering) All right, you guys ready to win this? Red 24 on one. Hall, you're gonna be open in the end zone. Catch it. On one. - Ready? - Break. Let's go. Hall: Me and you, buddy, me and you. (crowd cheering) Down! Check! Check! Check. Check. - Black seven! - What are you doing, man? - Black seven! - Murphy, what are you doing? Black seven! Black seven! Black seven! Black seven! Down! Set! Hike! Commentator: Touchdown, Coldwater! They will be the state champions of Ohio. Wow! (Murphy grunts) (winces) (birds chirping) (faint buzzing) (buzzing) Dispatch. Dispatch, this is Murphy. Come in. Dispatch. (engine sputtering) (rattling) I ran out of gas. (clock chiming) (wind whistling) (bell dings) (static buzzes) (engine whirring) (voices chattering) Hand: Come on, Culpepper. My grandmother could pick beans faster than that. The best six-and-four team I've ever seen. Seven and four. We won tonight. Hey, Coach? Thanks. No need. Now I'll see you on our field Monday. Tell your quarterbacks to be dressed and ready at 3:00 sharp. (engine starts) Hand: Brandon, get those baskets emptied and get your butt back here. Boy: Hey, Mr. Murphy. (chuckles) Oh, look who decided to show up. Gig: Murph, you missed a hell of a ceremony, man. Yeah, this twig catches one lucky pass... standing ovation. - Hey, you caught a pass? - Gig: Man, that was nothing. They would have torn the stadium down for you. - Dwight: Yep. - Amen. No, this is better. Where's my wife? In the barn. She's been looking for you. Macy! - Krista: Daddy! - Jamie: Daddy! Krista: Here he is. (Macy laughs) Here he is. Hi. You're back. Murphy: I love you. Look at this. Look at all these people, huh? I can't believe it. - Come here. - Come on. Jamie: Whoa. Murphy: Look at all these people. This is fun. (Macy, girls laugh) I get turned around and lost sometimes  And I lose my faith  And so caught up in a place  That's so unkind  But you find me  And you somehow set me free  And you remind me  We're in the middle of our dreams  And I love my life  I love the two of us  With you by me  I have more than I deserve  And more than enough  And I don't know much  But what I say is true  I know something  I'm nothing  Without you  If I had the chance to change my world  And everything I've done  I'd take what I did wrong  And make it right  I know I would not change a day  Not a single minute  'Cause I have everything I need here  Because you're in it  And I love my life  I love the two of us  With you by me  I have more than I deserve  And more than enough  And I don't know much  But what I say is true  I know something  I'm nothing without you  Let it rain, let it snow  Let the storm winds blow  'Cause I know  Whatever comes  We'll make it through it  And I love my life  And I love the two of us  With you by me  I have more than I deserve  And more than enough  And I don't know much  But what I say is true  I know something  I'm nothing without you  I know something  I'm nothing without you.  (music continues) I grew up in a small American town  And every time we get knocked down  We get back up off the mat  Fighting mad  Yeah, I like to believe in that  I daydream about a good dirt road  Going as far as it can go  And my baby smiles  When I pretend we're out of gas  Yeah, I like to believe in that  With everything I've been through  And everything I've done  I like to believe  That the best is yet to come  And the good times  Won't fly by too fast  I like to believe in that  I hope somewhere there's a dusty field  That later on this year will yield  A bumper crop  Not just a broken back  I like to believe in that  Yeah, and I pray somewhere  There's a little white church on a corner  Sitting there with doors wide open  For those of us who've slid off track  Yeah, I like to believe in that  With everything I've been through  And everything I've done  I'd like to believe  That the best is yet to come  And the good times  Won't fly by too fast  I like to believe in that  With everything I've been through  Yeah, and everything I've done  I like to believe  That the best is yet to come  And the good times  Won't fly by too fast  I like to believe in that  I grew up in a small American town  And every time we get knocked down  We get back up off the mat  Fighting mad  Yeah, I like to believe in that  I like to believe in that.
