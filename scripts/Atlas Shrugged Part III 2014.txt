When the owner of the company died, his children took over... and brought in a new plan to run the factory. The plan was that everybody would work as hard as they could, but share in their salaries and the profit based on need... That is, those who claimed they needed the money most... were the ones who got paid the most. This is a crucial moment in the history of this company. Now remember, each of us now belongs to the other... by the moral law we all voted for and we all accept. I don't. I don't accept it. His words caused confusion, but he stood there like a man who knew he was right. And I'm going to put a stop to this once and for all. How? I'll stop the motor of the world. Who is that guy? And with those words, he was gone. In the 12 years that followed, lights went out in the great factories... which had stood as solid as oak trees for generations. Their gates closed as if some silent power had turned them into lifeless shells. The world was quietly crumbling with no end in sight. The high seas weren't safe anymore. Cargo no longer reached its destination. Shortages grounded airlines and it was too expensive for most to drive. Regulations strangled the production of coal, gas, oil and nuclear power. Power outages were frequent because no copper was available... to maintain the transmission lines. Taggart Transcontinental, the largest railroad in the country, was one of the few things still operating. We began to wonder, we began to talk about what he'd said... and thought maybe he'd kept his word... That perhaps he had stopped the motor of the world. Some even tried to look for him, but he had vanished without a trace, and so had a lot of other people. We wondered what sort of impossible power he had to keep his promise. All the best and the brightest seemed to be disappearing without explanation. Perhaps people kept asking the question... because they knew something had gone missing from the world. Perhaps this is why we began to say it. We couldn't help but think of the young lab engineer... who said he would stop the motor of the world. You see, his name was... Who is John Galt? John Galt. Don't... Don't move. Miss Taggart, you're hurt. - You know me. - For many years. - Do I know you? - I think you do. - What is your name? - John Galt. Your name is John Galt? Why does that frighten you? Because I believe you. Was it you I was following? Yes. Where's your plane? It's... It's on the landing strip. Landing strip? On the other side of the valley. There was no... There was nothing. Look. Closely. You see that refracted image? It's to keep out the uninvited. I'll call Doc Hendricks. See what you can do. Right. Hey, Doc. Yeah, it's the plane. Dagny. Are you all right? Is that Dr. Akston? Well, thank goodness for that. I saved what I could from the wreck. The last time I saw you, I told you you would never find him... - and now here you are in his arms. - In whose arms? The man you were looking for... My philosophy student. The man who invented the motor. You invented the motor? You're lucky you didn't break your neck. - Is she all right? - Appears to be. Well, we didn't plan for this. She'll be my responsibility. Where are we? Mulligan's Valley. Midas! - That was quite a stunt, Dagny. - What are you doing here? I saw your plane. I never imagined it was being piloted... by one of only two people still missing from this valley. Who's the other? Hank Rearden, of course. Glad you're in one piece. Doc Hendricks will meet you. If she's up for it, bring her by my house tonight. I'll arrange something. - Your house? - Mine, yeah. All right. Nice and easy. Hi, Dagny. I am Dr. Thomas Hendricks. - May I have a look at your injuries? - The neurosurgeon? Yes. But here in the valley, I practice other medicine as well. Okay. This will only take a second. It's a diagnostic device I developed here in Atlantis. Every doctor should have one. It's amazing what can be accomplished without red tape. Okay. Good news. Nothing serious. Sprained ankle, some bruised ribs. No sign of a concussion. So, I would like you to stay off your feet for a few days and get some rest. Call me if you have any questions. - Thank you, Doctor. - You're welcome. Send me the bill. Absolutely not. No, I... I will pay for this myself. - We'll discuss that later. - Our first trespasser. - Thank you, Doctor. - All right. So you invented the motor? Let's get you to your room. - I can walk. - I know. Here we are. - Am I a guest or a prisoner? - Well, that choice is yours. How can I make that choice when I'm dealing with a stranger? But you're not. Didn't you name the John Galt line after me? Yes, I did. But I named it after my enemy. Well, that's the contradiction you're going to have to figure out... sooner or later. It was you, wasn't it? You destroyed my line. - You're the destroyer. - Get some rest. Midas invited us to dinner. There will be some people there looking forward to seeing you. Why should I trust you? The world crisis was worsening. And as the head of state announced that he would address the nation, word was spreading quickly that another giant of industry, Dagny Taggart, had gone missing. Meanwhile, the government again increased its reward... for the capture of pirate Ragnar Danneskold. Dagny. For a woman that just fell out of the sky, you look pretty damn good. Thank you, Midas. And you... you look just the same. Come on in. Ladies and gentlemen, Taggart Transcontinental. Hear, hear! Dagny, it's wonderful to have you here. Enjoy the evening. Thank you, Rebecca. Everyone here has a story. - Is that Kay Ludlow? - Straight from Hollywood. How did you get here, Midas? Me? I made my fortune lending people money to buy houses and build businesses, and I only loaned to those people I was confident could repay me. Sure. They called me heartless, which I could live with. But when they forced me to give loans to people who could never pay me back, I got the hell out. Come. You must be hungry. When the politicians started making medical decisions for me, I decided I couldn't be a party to it anymore. Here in this valley, I treat my patients using my professional judgment, not some political directive. Dagny, we are on strike. What happened to Midas, what happened to Doc, it happened to each of us. No man belongs to another, Dagny. But there are those in power who would have you think otherwise. We honor charity and benevolence, but it must be provided on the giver's terms... Voluntarily, and not by force. The powerful try to make us feel guilty for our success. And we are guilty... guilty for sacrificing ourselves... and for working under their terms. So we had to withdraw, to go on strike. But what about what you left behind? We left nothing behind, Dagny. What... We took with us the only real thing of value. Dagny, this is a strike of our minds. So what are you demanding? Nothing. We're not trying to impose our values on the world that we left behind. They're free to continue to believe as they want, whatever they want. But they're going to have to do it without our help. Hear, hear. Dagny. Ellis Wyatt. I can't believe it. I felt abandoned. I finished the John Galt line to move your oil, and you disappeared on me. You quit when I needed you most. All of you did. Now you know why. Well, perhaps, but you made a very difficult task nearly impossible. Dagny, I couldn't keep supporting a system that was determined to destroy me. Had I let 'em, they... They'd have never stopped. Everyone here knows that. We know what it takes to build something... and how little recognition you get from the outside world. You deserve more. You deserve to hear what each of us heard when we arrived here... Well done, Dagny. Well done. While the government was busy passing the Metal Unification Act... to try and solve the steel shortage through greater regulation, Ragnar Danneskold sunk several more ships carrying copper, resulting in more frequent electrical outages. Dagny, I want you to stay for one month... just to see it all for yourself, and at the end, you can choose to stay or go. But while you're here, you gotta follow our rules. Our first rule is that no one provides unearned sustenance for another person. I'll pay my own way. I doubt it. You're penniless. What? Well, your money has no value here. What do you mean? Well, here in the Gulch, we deal in gold. I see. Then I'll earn my keep. - How? - Hire me. I'll cook, clean, do laundry in exchange for room and board... and a little money for something to wear other than this. You... You really want to do that? Yes. Then you're hired. Here. An advance. Where did you get these? The Mulligan bank. Whose house is that? Francisco. He was the first. So he destroyed his reputation and the family's copper mines for the strike? That's not all he gave up. You know that he and I were very close at one time. I do. What did he tell you? Nothing in particular, but with his tone? Everything. They'll be happy to see you. Ragnar Danneskold? Dagny Taggart. Have you joined us? No, I haven't. I'm, - A scab? I crashed the gate. Literally. So you are a scab. And you're a pirate. Right? I, have been accused of making the seas unsafe. But only for those ships carrying goods... taken by government force from the rightful owners. I'm just returning what's been stolen. Now, if that makes me a pirate... well, so be it. See you around, I'm sure. - Hi, Miss Taggart. - Oh. Hello. So they're not in school? - Oh, no. I'm homeschooling them. - Oh. I joined the strike because I wouldn't put them in an educational system... that doesn't teach them to think. I guess they have some great role models around here, don't they? Oh, yeah. They do. And they're very happy. Oh. - Have a great day. - Thank you. Thanks. As the 100th anniversary of Taggart Bridge, America's most important railroad overpass, came and went with little fanfare, Jim Taggart continued to intentionally mislead the public, announcing that the copper wire shortage... would not necessarily affect transporting Minnesota's wheat. He also announced that Dagny had died, and that her absence would not affect railroad operations. Gentlemen, science belongs to the people, not a single individual just because he invented it. Every man on the face of the globe... has the right to share in the advantages created by technological progress. It is vitally important that we maintain a positive public opinion. We can't allow criticism of the project at this time. Gentlemen, we should all be very proud to usher in this new era. These new instruments of peace will protect us from any and all aggressors. Project F will allow us to keep order in the streets and protect the public. Mr. Thompson... Jimmy. Sorry to hear about the loss of your sister Dagny. She'll be sorely missed. Thank you. I just want you to know... that we really need the Railroad Unification Act to save our transportation system. All for one, one for all. I mean, that's the key here. Getting things going. In fact, we've appointed Cuffy Meigs to direct the initiative. For the public good. Absolutely. We need to make sure the speech is on all the networks. In a lot of ways, this valley represents... what your great grandfather, Nat, saw in our country... Unbridled opportunity, where innovation is rewarded. You see, he built the Taggart Bridge over the Mississippi... and connected an entire nation by rail. When the courts tried to stop him, he fought and he prevailed. That bridge is still standing today. True. True, but as the country prospered, the people gave the government more and more power. Those in charge saw successful businessmen as a threat to their control, so they simply took what was created in the name of the public good. So you convinced the others to strike. Each one was invited here. You... You're the first person to come to this valley by accident. If you choose to stay, you'll have to join us in what we are trying to accomplish. You have an important decision to make. But I love the railroad my great grandfather built. Good night. Was it as difficult for all the others? The first night was. Is this the room where they arrive? I never intended you to occupy this room. Good night. Francisco D'Anconia's copper mines, the world's largest remaining mines, were closed due to a series of explosions. No workers were injured, but no new copper was available. Francisco. You're two days late. What happened? - Sorry I'm late, John. - Come in, I'll get you a drink. But listen, I came to tell you that I won't be long. - Francisco. - I'm concerned... Dagny. It's like I can't believe you're alive! Oh. And you're here. Now you know everything. Now you understand why. Frisco, you should know... I'm here by accident. I'm not part of the strike. How did you get here? It's a long story. The main thing is that you are safe. He's right. - I'll come by later. - All right then. And I want to spend some time with you. Me too. - I'll stop by. - Bye, John. Welcome back. I'm going to stop by the power plant to check the output levels. Power plant? Yes. Come on. The motor generates enough power for the entire valley. In fact, it could power the entire West Coast. How? It converts atmospheric electricity into energy... at virtually no cost. - Is this it? - Yes. I can't believe this powers the entire valley. No amount of force will grant you access to that motor. Allow me. I swear by my life and my love of it... that I will never live for the sake of another man... nor ask another man to live for mine. Not yet. Everyone has taken that oath who lives in this valley. Everyone except you. Well, that's what I do. I live for myself, not for others, just, unlike you, I don't believe in abandoning the fight. Well, we're going to have to see which one of us is wrong. Until then, I know you won't say those words until you mean them... the way they're intended. I still don't understand why you don't use mules, Francisco. Mules, John? These animals are not so friendly. They're just as stubborn as women. Frisco, you are wasting an unconscionable amount of time... bringing your copper ore up this way. You ought to build a rail line down to the smelter. I know, but it's such a difficult job. Besides, the mine's output doesn't justify the expense. That's nonsense. You see that pass to the east? - Uh-huh. - It's an easier grade with softer stone. It wouldn't take a lot of curves. Maybe three miles of rail, narrow gauge. - You have a pen and paper? - Here. It'll pay for itself in three years. Here. Look. I might have to blast a tunnel here, a few hundred feet or less, and I'd need a steel trestle to bring the track across this gorge. We'd bring it down here. It's not that difficult, and it would cut off that last mile of corkscrew turns. I could have the track laid in three months. Oh, what for? Abandon an entire transcontinental system... to build three miles of railroad. If you change your mind, I'll hire you on the spot. Or Midas can give you a loan if you want to own it. No, I can't. Not yet. I wish I could just stay here and never know what my brother is doing to the railroad. Well, you would hear about it... every wreck, every explosion, every broken line. And eventually, the collapse of the Taggart Bridge. That's not going to happen. Dagny, nobody stays here by faking reality. Well, I'll get back to my job then. Enjoy your last week, Dagny. Here's a question for you... If Taggart Transcontinental were your own company, would you hire your brother Jim? Good God, no. No, I wouldn't hire him as a track worker. I mean, he's... he's completely incompetent. Then why do Jim and all of his cronies have so much power? Why do they? Because they promote the idea that it's okay... to take from one man, give to another. Dagny, all of your life, you've heard people saying... that we have to help the less fortunate, that the measure of virtue is... Is not what you achieve, but what you do for others. You... You've heard them say... that people have a right to a living just because they're human. And that's not the right to earn a living, that is a right to a living, which you are required to provide for them. Now, do you see any common themes here? Need of others paramount, your needs secondary? Their philosophy is based on how much you sacrifice to other people, not on what you achieve. That philosophy can't work. Unless you continue to work and work and work and work... and try to overcome all the obstacles which they have created for you. And no matter how much they take from you, they still count on your work ethic, your integrity, your desire to keep producing. But I... I love what I do. No, I know. Yeah, so did John. Yeah, but he refused to accept their ideas. He refused to put his ability... his motor... At their disposal. As long as you continue to accept it, they will continue to exploit your extraordinary abilities. While Thompson and his cronies were holed up... in the Wayne-Falkland Hotel in New York, preparing for his big speech on November 23, Henry Rearden continued his search for Dagny Taggart. John, that's Hank Rearden, one man you have yet to bring here... One you wanted for some time. Maybe Francisco can convince him. Maybe. So, how was the lecture tonight? Well... John, what is it? You've got something on your mind. I know you too well, my friend. Of all of us here, I know that you're the one who's given up the most. I'll be all right, John. It's time to get Hank. We're out of chocolate cake. Oh, you scared me. What are you doing? Well, I told you. I've been watching you. I couldn't sleep. My mind's racing. You? Well, I have a stranger in my house. When's the first time you saw me? I remember that well. You were standing on the Taggart passenger platform. You were wearing an evening gown and a shawl, and if your shawl had slipped any further down, you'd have been standing there naked. And you belonged there. Not in some silk-curtained sitting room, but there. Among the rails. Did you see that plane circling the valley today? Yes. That was Hank Rearden. He's a good man. Anticipating greater unrest, the State Science Institute... began developing crude, but lethal, crowd-control devices. As the Unification Board... remained incapable of clearing the rockslide blocking the Taggart Tunnel, cross-country transportation was now crippled. So, Dagny... Have you made your decision? I think so. But I'm not sure. And it's too important not to be completely certain. If any of your uncertainty... is a conflict between your heart and your mind, follow your mind. That wasn't the advice I was expecting. Let it go until it's time. We still have you with us tonight. Francisco, you'll be back in a few months. November at the latest. And, John, you're not returning to New York this time, are you? I haven't decided yet. You're not thinking about going back to that hell, are you? I am. But, John, why? Well, I'll tell you once I've decided. But everyone's here except Hank, and he'll be here soon enough. And Dagny, if she chooses. Your job is done. There's nothing more for you to look for out there. I know. When the rails are nationalized, everything will collapse. Why risk it? They are getting serious about the disappearances. They suspect something. You, of all people, shouldn't be there. The infrastructure's falling apart. Just the physical risk of complex machinery in the hands of blind fools... You'll be taking a chance every time you step on a train. There's been one collision after another. Not to mention the weapons the SSI have been testing to maintain the peace, as they say. If I go back, it won't be for the strike. It'll be to get the only thing I want for myself. There's going to be riots. Electricity's being rationed. Food supply chains are being severed. In no time at all, there'll be one train a week, and then one train a month, and then the Taggart Bridge will collapse. No. No. That won't happen. Then you've made your decision. I have. As long as I am alive, I will not desert a battle that is mine to fight. You'll be back, Dagny. And we'll be here waiting for you. We need to discuss the conditions of your departure. First, you have to give us your word that you won't disclose anything about this valley. You can't reveal our... our cause, our existence, your whereabouts for the past month, to anyone for any reason. I give you my word. Second, you never attempt to come back uninvited again. Have you decided? Are you going back? Yes. But Frisco said it's too dangerous for you. I don't want you to go. It's not up to you. You're going for my sake. No, for mine. Will we see each other? No. Will you be watching me? More so. Why? To be there the day you decide to join us. What if I told you I will never join you? - That would be a lie. - John, the risk! I wouldn't do it if I had no selfish end to gain. What selfish end? I want you here. I need to make sure you can't find your way back. You'll find a Taggart station in town. Don't look for me. When you need me, I'll be the easiest man in the world to find. - Hank. - Dagny? I'm so sorry. It's okay. You don't need to apologize. There's something I have to tell you. I'm just happy to hear your voice, to know you're all right. What we had together is a memory I will always cherish. - I'm so sorry, Hank. - I'm happy, Dagny. I've got to run. Frisco is waiting. We'll see each other soon. Who is John Galt? Jim Taggart scheduled a press conference... announcing the sudden return of his sister Dagny to New York. Meanwhile, several Rearden steelworkers died defending a mill... against a violent takeover by government-sponsored union thugs. At the same time, the diverted Taggart trains... stopped transporting badly needed Minnesota wheat to the East Coast. I'm not accustomed to being dragged away from the SSI without rhyme or reason. Dr. Stadler. Precisely. Which makes me appreciate you all the more. Why am I here? Walk with me. I have another meeting in five minutes. Dr. Stadler, more than ever, the government needs to present a strong, unified front... to bolster the confidence of the people. The head of state has a grand vision for the future. And he expects the full support of the State Science Institute, namely your full support on our current project. My full support for what? You'll get the specifics later. Now listen carefully, Doctor. What I'm about to share with you is highly confidential... and crucial to the nation's welfare. "Project F"? Why, this looks like an instrument of torture. Why wasn't I told about this? How dare you use my research to create this... this... this weapon? I didn't spend eight years to see my research turned into this. I mean, I have... Your signature, Doctor. The public needs to know... the tax money spent on SSI research serves the public. I founded the SSI to expand the frontiers of knowledge. This is not the time for impractical idealism. The motive for Project F is not up for discussion. Consider yourself informed, Doctor. What if I don't want to give my support? What if I don't agree with this... this abomination? Well, then. ...all operations. In other news, Head of State Thompson said... there is no national problem with aviation safety... despite yesterday's Amalgamated Airlines crash which killed 35 passengers. Just do it, Eddie. You've been Dagny's right-hand man for years, so take care of it. Dagny... I'll be with you in a minute. Just cancel the Comet for the schedule for tomorrow and Tuesday. Fire the engines to Arizona for the grapefruit special... and send the orders out immediately. You'll do nothing of the kind. Minnesota needs that line to move the harvest. Send the orders. Excuse me. Thank God. Dagny, I thought that... You're not sending any orders. But Washington sent him here to oversee the Railroad Unification Act. Washington doesn't run this railroad. I do. Dagny. I, - Jim. Heard the good news you're okay. I'm, - I'm glad you're back. Alive. There are some urgent... the most urgent thing now is... for you to go to the press and tell them you didn't quit. I'm not doing any press. No, you have to. They've been all... I'm not going to reassure the public about the state of our industry, Jim. What is this Railroad Unification Act? Well, it's a new national setup that went into effect about three weeks ago... which you will approve of and appreciate and find extremely good... for Taggart Transcontinental. What is it? You are aware we are in an emergency situation, right? The country's top priority is to preserve the transportation industry. The national survival requires... What is the plan? What does it do? Every railroad in the country has been unified into a single team. Pooling their resources. You've nationalized the railroad. No skin off your back. Cuffy. Cuffy, please. Dagny, under the act, all of the gross revenue will be turned over... to the Railroad Pool Board in Washington... where it will then be distributed on a more modern principle of distribution... What principle? You know... You know, we're fine. This is good for business. You know, we're doing... We're doing great. We'll finish this later. Are you seein' what I'm seein' up there, boss? The electrical wire's been compromised. Switches are out. It's not my fault! Look, you're on your own. - Operations. - Is this Eddie Willers? Hey, it's not my place to tell you, but nobody else will. - We're about to have a disaster on our hands. - Who is this? I'm a lineman in your California division. Let's leave it at that. They tell me it's orders from the Unification Board... and to mind my own damn business. What's your name? It doesn't matter. I'm outta here. Good luck. Wait! Thompson's PR people were heavily promoting his big speech, predicting it would be the most-watched broadcast in history. You tell that little con artist I've already got the rail offsets fast-tracked. I just... It is a complete disaster, Jim. What are you talking about? What disaster? Your Railroad Unification Plan. - We're going over a cliff. - What? The board has hijacked all our rolling stock. The harvests are rotting in Minnesota. And we don't have the copper wire we need to keep the lines running. That's not true. They prioritize the projects vital to public welfare. Some will just have to wait their turn. Well, you tell that to the family that's about to run out of food. No, no. Don't... Don't be so dramatic. Dramatic? What are you thinking? We are the last railroad that can move the harvests. If we don't get trains out there, the East Coast will run out of food. So what do you wanna do about it? You're the problem solver around here. Yeah, I am. And what if I woke up one day and just said, "I'm not gonna find a way today"? What if I just left? Hell, you've been gone for a month doing who knows what. Who do you think has been taking care of business around here? No one. Yeah. I need you to check this one again, Eddie. Will you? I'm on it. Thank you. What is it? Did they release the rolling stock? There's a very important dinner tomorrow night at the Wayne-Falkland. I promised the boys that you'd be there. Seriously, Jim. A dinner? Do you have any idea what's going on here? Thompson's inner circle will be there. Why? We're gonna talk about shipping the harvests. You want to be in on that decision, don't you? They're gonna decide how to save the harvest at a dinner? If you really want to help your farmer friends, now's your chance. Friends? They're our customers, Jim. Listen, it's formal, but don't overdo it. It would please them. Tell me you're joking. Nobody, not even Dagny Taggart, will deny that there are times when it's necessary... to sacrifice the parts for the sake of the whole. What parts are we talking about, Mr. Meigs? Well, the sickly parts, of course. Like Minnesota. They have to be sacrificed in order to save the whole... The entire system. Sacrifice Minnesota? Well, yes. We have to keep cross-country routing intact... in case we need to move troops between states. You understand. Balance peacekeeping with the recovery. To keep order. You cut off Minnesota, you cut off the supply of wheat. You might be able to sacrifice an arm or a leg, but you cannot save a body by sacrificing its heart or its brain. Well, we're depending upon... the local farmers in the Northeast to pick up the slack. We're counting on it. There aren't enough local farmers to feed a population that size. You know, Miss Taggart, it's a great responsibility... to hold the decision of life or death... over millions of people... Sacrifice thousands, if necessary. But we must have the courage to do so. We have to be practical, scientific. - Public welfare is one... - Pipe down, Jimmy. Of our biggest... Cuffy, there's trouble in California. There's talk of seceding from the union. Oregon's overrun by gangs. They've murdered two tax collectors. Excuse me. Cuffy's right. Let's move the rail stock from Minnesota. Eddie. What? How long ago? I'll be there in 10 minutes. - Excuse me, gentlemen. - Dagny? - Da... Dagny, where are you going? - Sit down, Jimmy boy. We're droppin' Minnesota. - Jeff. - Miss Taggart. - What's the matter? - Switching signals are dead. I got four inbound trains, two outgoing, all frozen. I can't get 'em out of the damn tunnels. We can't seem to find the breach in the system. I'm telling you, Miss Taggart, there's just no guidelines for this kind of emergency. I'll take care of it. Eddie, where's the systems engineer? Can't find him. Call Chicago Southern. Tell them to get their systems guy out of bed and get him down here. - Tell them I'll pay whatever it costs. - I'm on it. We'll make our own guidelines, Jeff. Get all of our nonadministrative people out here... all of 'em. Section hands, track walkers, whoever's in the terminal... - I want them here now. - Here? I'm responsible. Get every source light and lantern you can lay your hands on. Then get some red and green cellophane and tape. Lanterns? Lanterns. Get going. - Yes, ma'am. - What are we doing here, Miss Taggart? We're going to move the trains. How? By hand. I want you to put a man with a light at each switch. That could take all night! And all day tomorrow, if that's what it takes. But these trains will move. Excuse me. Bring it in! Hey, hey. Come on in, guys. Hey, listen up, guys! Hey. I'm Dagny Taggart. The instructions you are about to receive come from me. The men who issue them are acting under my instructions. The tower director will assign the switchmen to their posts. I count on each of you... to get the trains rolling and to... Something wrong, Miss Taggart? Go ahead. Assign the posts. Let's do this. Let's go! Hey, I can see the signal! It's workin'! It's actually workin'! Son of a gun. Who's John Galt? When the Rearden steel mills fell silent... after Hank's disappearance, the Unification Board called him a greedy, selfish capitalist, while Thompson promised to announce greater reforms to get things back on track. At the same time, Cherryl Taggart, Jim's wife, learned she had married a fraud. Jim Taggart was not the man she thought he was. Floyd? Hey, Jimmy. Yeah, I just read the article about Cherryl. Yeah, that's... No, that's not my fault. Right. Right. I had nothing to do with it. Sure. It's tragic. I just... Say, your sister's gonna help Thompson, right? Yeah. No, I'm gonna... I mean, she is. I'm gonna get her to be on stage with him. All right... yeah. It's gonna help the underprivileged. That's something you should know about. You're always so damn anxious to hide the fact... that you come from the slums. I'm a genius! I'm gonna have more money than you could possibly imagine. More than those grubby mechanics, Rearden and my sister. Whatever they do, I can undo just like that. Just like that! Like snapping a spine. - Now you want to break spines? - Oh, God, I never said that. You know I never said that. That's not what I meant. What is... What's the matter with you? - What's the matter with me? - What's the matter with you? I came to apologize. There's no reason why you should forgive me. I just learned the truth about you and Jim. I know it's you who runs the railroad... and you who built the John Galt Line. Can you forgive me? Of course I forgive you. Thank you, Dagny. You might want to dial it down just a little bit. Mr. Thompson sits between science and industry. Dr. Stadler, please. The chair on Mr. Thompson's left. Miss Taggart, to the right. Showtime. Twenty seconds. Am I a guest or prisoner? That choice is yours. In 10... Didn't you name the John Galt Line after me? But I named it after my enemy. Well, that's the contradiction that you're gonna have to figure out. ...four, three... I won't be a part of this. You won't? It's not just for the press, Miss Taggart. It's for the audience also. - Dagny, for Christ's sake! - Cherryl deserved better. Get her back here! Is anyone with a brain left in this country? - Dagny! - Ladies and gentlemen, Head of State Thompson. Good evening, my fellow Americans. Tonight, I can't... Ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Thompson will not speak to you tonight. His time is up. For years, you've asked, "Who is John Galt?" You've asked that question in despair and resignation... as factories closed, goods became scarce, jobs disappeared. Your lives are becoming more difficult... as the life force of your world is draining away. You have asked that question without expecting an answer. I'm here to answer it. This is John Galt speaking. Mr. Thompson won't tell you the truth about the crisis in your world. I will. Have you noticed that as everything around you seems to decline, one thing still grows? It is the power of your rulers. None of their plans and directives... have solved your problems or made your life better. The only result has been their increased control over you... at the cost of your freedom. Do you know why? You gave them the power. They called for your sacrifice, and you thought it was noble. They said if you worked for yourself and your family, that you were selfish and uncaring. And they made you feel ashamed. They denounced the leaders of industry as greedy exploiters... The Ellis Wyatts, the Hank Reardens. And again, you agreed. And then you ask, "Why did they and others like them disappear?" I took them from you. Their achievements flowed from their creative minds. Once they understood that the attempt to control their work... was an attempt to control their minds, they left. The people on strike worked for themselves, for their own vision of what was possible. When they recognized the honor they deserved, they rebelled against the guilt you wanted them to feel for their success. You counted on them to keep producing, to keep thinking... Even as you denounced them as selfish. I showed them they were being punished for their own virtues, and I showed them how evil that is. I made it my mission to help these heroes say no. All evil needs to win... is the consent of good people. They have joined me to freely produce, trade, cooperate and compete in a place... where the rights of all are protected. Do not try to find us. Do not try to bargain for our return. Get out of our way. To everyone within the range of my voice, you now have a choice to make. If you decide to support the notion of sacrifice enforced by the State, your game is up. Your world is in a downward spiral, and you will ride it down to destruction. But if you share the values of our strike, if you believe that your life is a sacred possession... for you to make the most of, if you want to live by the judgment of your own mind, not edicts from the State, then follow our lead. Do not support your own oppressors. Stop letting the system exploit you. Form your own communities on the frontiers of your crumbling world. Your rulers hold you by your endurance... to carry the burdens they impose, by your generosity when you hear cries of despair, and above all, by your innocence, which cannot grasp the depths of their evil. The world you are living in is the world they wanted. Leave them to it. Those who have left you are eager to build a better world, a world of freedom and opportunity, a world based on mutual respect. In that world, you will rise in the morning... with the spirit you knew in childhood... The spirit of eagerness and adventure... and the confidence that the world is what it is... and is there for you to discover. In that world, you will not receive alms, nor pity, nor forgiveness of sins, but honor, respect and justice. Don't let the fire go out, spark by irreplaceable spark, in confusion and despair. Be sure of your path. The world you desire can be won. It exists. It is real. It is possible. It is yours. Come on, let's go. Did that just happen? Stop that damned buzzing noise! Go to regular programming. Somebody has the courage to tell the truth. "Be sure of your path. " Is that all you have? If that speech doesn't do Thompson in, I don't know what will. It's not funny. The American people need government. And I think that one of the rarest commodities in this country right now is courage. I think we saw a lot of it tonight. If we didn't cut it off, it'll look like we authorized that speech. You damned fool! Would you rather them think we didn't authorize it? - Muzzle those commentators! - Look. Galt is one man. I don't know who the hell he thinks he is, but he needs to be arrested, humiliated! - Oh, the public's not gonna believe that! - No, no, no, no. That speech was way over their heads. You know what? Galt was right about one thing. The public can't think for themselves. They have to be controlled. What do you propose we do, Floyd? He just gave you the answers. - What more do you need to know? - Dagny, I'll make him a deal. Good night, gentlemen. Dagny, thank you for speaking your mind. I just want you to know that you can trust us. We're not your enemies. We've made mistakes. We're only human! Find him, and then we'll make him a deal. I don't think he's someone who's open to a deal. You just be careful with this, okay? Everyone's open to cutting a deal. She's one of them. Just watch her. I think she may be able to help us, huh? You got it. Mr. Thompson stated, "There is no cause for alarm. " He urges the public not to draw any uninformed conclusions, to preserve a sense of broad-minded tolerance and discipline. Says Thompson, "We must regard it as one viewpoint in our forum of opinion. The truth has many facets. We must remain impartial. " No. No. - We want Galt! - Yeah! - We want Galt! - We want Galt! We want Galt! We want Galt! We want Galt! We heard it on the streets. We heard it online. We heard it everywhere. The people wanted Galt. Who's John Galt? I am John Galt. I am John Galt. I am John Galt! Oh, my. Are Thompson's days numbered. Who is John Galt? I have to tell you, as I'm watching this myself, I'm thinking, "Scream it! Shout it!" But that would be the way I would do it... in exactly the wrong way. Because nobody would hear it, and he'd look like a mad man. Finally, somebody says the truth... and says it the way it was supposed to be said. Power comes from the vision, not the volume. We want Galt! I want it stopped. We want Galt! We want Galt! Bring me Dagny Taggart. We want Galt! We want Galt! He doesn't need to commit to anything. I just need him to know that I'm ready to meet his terms, whatever they are. I really can't help you. We have tried, but we cannot find Mr. Galt. Now, we've placed... What Mr. Thompson means to say is, we hope he's alive. Miss Taggart, I am a peaceful man. I simply want to help him. What if someone not as amiable as Mr. Thompson... was to locate him before we did? I'd just hate to think... Now, Floyd. We're also offering a substantial reward. I wouldn't know how to help you. Think she's lying? She knows where he is. We want Galt! We want Galt! John Galt represents today... the sentiment of millions and millions of people... who are sick and tired of the endless wars, the attacks on our civil liberties, the abuse of what's happening in the economy, the poverty that is coming. And those are the people who are speaking out, and they needed a voice. John Galt, in many ways, is that voice. Hey! I was so afraid. I had to warn you. You don't need to explain, but you were followed. I don't think so. I made sure... You know, one thing they're good at is snooping. They'll be here any minute. - Then let's get out of here right now. - No. No. From now on, you have to make them think that you are on their side, - that I'm your enemy. - What? If you do, I have a chance to survive this. They need me alive, but they wouldn't think twice about hurting you or worse. And I couldn't stand that. If I hear of it, I will kill myself and stop them right there. Convince them that you hate me. You must. Do you understand? I do. So you lived here, all these years, like this? Well, more like this. The motor! We have to hide it. It's all right. Mr. Galt! Open up, sir. All right. Don't be afraid. Okay? It's okay. Mr. Galt! - That's him. That's John Galt. - Get out! Stay where you are, sir. Ma'am, I need you to back up, please. Right there. We need to see some ID, please. I'm Dagny Taggart. He's the one. - Both of you, please. - He's the one we've been looking for. Mr. Thompson is waiting to speak with him in person. Tell you what. I'll cooperate if you get this woman away from me. - Is that room clear? - Miss Taggart, thank you. You can step outside. We'll handle things from here. I'll be expecting my reward. Miss Taggart, Mr. Thompson will be very grateful for your efforts. Mr. Galt. It's an honor, sir. What are you looking for? Just to be certain that you're out of danger, sir. The men'll just be a moment. - Am I under arrest? - No, sir. Our orders are to escort you safely to Head of State Thompson, where your presence is needed. - It won't open. - Mr. Galt, sir? It's locked. Would you mind unlocking that door, please? - There's no key. - Sir, I have orders to search the entire apartment. - It would be helpful if... - Go right ahead. No amount of force will grant you access to that motor. Allow me. "I swear by my life and my love of it... that I will never live for the sake of another man... nor ask another man to live for mine. " We got nothing. We need to go. We want Galt! We want Galt! Hello? Well, well. John? So you're the young fella that started all this. I'm tickled pink to meet ya. Just tickled pink. I'm Thompson. How do you do? Make yourself comfortable. You're... You're an important man. Yeah, that was some speech you made. You've done something to this country. I don't know what or why. But... people seem to want what it is you sell. Now, I may not agree with everything you say, but I'm always willing to change my mind. Now, you don't... you don't expect us to agree with everything you say, do ya? No. Yeah. You want something to drink? Get him something to drink. Well, the world's in a hell of a mess, just like you said. On that, I do agree with you. Sit down there, Floyd. Sit down. Thank you. So... what do you have to say? Nothing. Nothing? I didn't ask to speak with you. Yeah, but we have a lot to discuss. Now... I'm offering you a deal. Well, I'm always open to a deal. I knew it! I knew it! I told those theorizers of mine. I'm always open to a deal with anyone who has a value to offer me. Well, then, hell, write your own ticket. What are you offering? Anything you want. Such as? Well, your terms, of course. Lookit... Listen, I am certain... that you are a man that can make things work? I'm ready to give in. I'm... I am willing to amend the system. I told you what to do. What? Get out of the way. Wait a second. Now, now, now, I said "amend. " I didn't say "abandon. " That's just out of the question. You see, I am offering you Wesley Mouch's job. Huh? Now, there's nothing bigger than that. You're free to do anything at all. You don't like regulations? Well, repeal 'em. You... You want higher profits, lower wages? Decree 'em. You want special privileges? Grant them. You don't like the unions? Dissolve 'em. You play it any way you want, but... just think about it. In Washington, everyone's gonna want to be your best friend. Oh. You're gonna have power. Wait. Now, what? What? I'm offering you the best job in the world. What is... What is wrong with that? But that kind of job shouldn't exist. No one should have that kind of power. I can't figure you out. Get him out of here. And take that idiot Taggart with you. - SSI? - Yes. We want Galt! We want Galt! Get him out! Once standing as a monument to American individualism, the Taggart Bridge had finally surrendered to regulation. Dagny! Oh! Did you hear? The Taggart Bridge collapsed. Listen, Frisco, I'm ready. "I swear by my life and my love of it... that I will never live for the sake of another man... nor ask another man to live for mine. " Let's go, slugger. Ragnar has his helicopter standing by. Secure him there. Project F? What the hell are we doing here? This was never my intention. John, this is not my fault! You might want to leave, Jimmy boy. This is gonna get ugly. No. I want to be here. I wanna... I wanna see this. I wanna see him break. Okay. Your choice. Cuffy? Stand by to initialize power. Get this straight. You are going to help us. Agree, and all this goes away. You understand? Suit yourself, genius. Of all people, not him! I want no part of this. Then get out of here before I make you trade places with him. Go on, go! Again. I'm here on behalf of Mr. Thompson. You wouldn't disobey an order from Mr. Thompson, would you? No. You're... You're Dagny Taggart. Then on direct order from Mr. Thompson, you are to let me in immediately. No. Dr. Ferris said I wasn't supposed to let just anyone in. You need to make a decision. Listen to me very carefully. This is about your life. If you die, you won't know what you're dying for. If I die, I will. Either you let me in, or I shoot. - Now decide. - I'm not supposed to decide. I'm just an average guy. One. I'm not supposed to make decisions about my life. - Two. - I haven't said I won't. I haven't said I will. - Three. - I'm only following orders! Make sure it's okay in here. All right. Let's go. Let's go. Had enough? I understand you're some kind of electrical engineer. So tell me, Mr. Galt, in your expert opinion, how we doing? Again. Again. I think Project F likes you. Again. Okay. Do it. Do it! - What's the matter? - What's the problem? - What? - How the hell would I know? - Well, find someone who does! - Hey, watch your tone. Come on. Replace the fuse, and the machine will work. This is ridiculous! I won't have it! I won't have it! Do it! Do it! Hey, hey. Jimmy, calm down! Jimmy... Come on. Come on! We'll be back, you son of a bitch! John! John! John! John. Damn it! Damn it! I swear by my life! John, come back to me! Come back! John! Damn it! Damn it. You're... You're alive! Thank goodness. You're here! I'm back. I'm back. I love you. I'm okay. - John. - Hold him, hold him, hold him. Okay. I got him. I got him. Give me your arm. Give me your arm, John. Go ahead. I got it. We got ya. We got ya, John. We got ya. We got ya. We're almost there. We're almost there. Come on. We're almost there. Okay, careful. Careful. Hang in there. I got the door. Grab my hand. Get in! Get in! Midas is waiting on the other side of the trees. Don't worry about it. We've got one more man to pick up. We'll see you soon. Eddie. Thank you. Let's go. Chopper 2. We are airborne. You're cleared to head back to Atlantis. Dr. Hendricks is standing by. Tell John he's in good hands. Just lie still. Lie still. Who's Ragnar talking to? Midas. He's flying the other helicopter. We tried. We couldn't stop him and the others from coming. Don't worry, John. We've got your back. Good. Yeah. Escaped? What do you mean? What? Wh-Where's Ferris? What do you mean, tied up? Hello? Hello? What the hell is happening? John. I need you to know, I never wanted to leave you. You're my forever. It's the end. No. It's the beginning. In the name of the best within you, do not sacrifice your sense of life to an enemy... that would claim your precious mind. Do not let your fire go out, spark by irreplaceable spark. Do not let the hero in your soul perish in lonely frustration... for the life you deserve, but have never been able to reach. The world you desire can be won. It exists. It is real. It is possible. It is yours. This is John Galt speaking.
