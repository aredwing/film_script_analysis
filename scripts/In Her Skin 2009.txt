You start the journey in fear and spend every day trying to keep that unknown threat at bay. But in my heart of hearts, I knew danger had caught up. I was off guard, asleep on duty. [solemn orchestral music] [melancholy orchestral rock music] # What you wanna say? # [water splashing] # I'll wait till you get home # # I'm sick of communicating # # Over the telephone # # But tell me how you feel # # For I am lonely too # # Need you to know # # I'm just as cold and numb # # as you # [chimes jingling] [deep, echoing breaths] # Ah, ah, ah, ah # # Ah, ah, ah, ah # [tram rattling] [brakes hissing] [tram engine chugging] [tram engine stops] [phone ringing] [door slams shut] You don't have to wait. You girls go watch... watch TV. Hello? Rachel never got off the tram. Has she called you? No, do you think she got off at the Campbell stop instead? I don't think so. We arranged that I'd pick her up here an hour ago. Something's happened. I'm gonna call the police. Liz, maybe you should wait. She's never late. Never. No, I know, but why don't you call Manni first? And I'll wait here, and I'll call you back in a bit. [phone ringing] Done everything right, did Michael Gardner. He sprinted back to the vacant goal square. Emmanuel... [speaking Italian] [phone continues ringing] Emmanuel! Hey, babe. Is Rachel with you? Oh, hi, Elizabeth. Isn't she home? No, she didn't come home. Manni, do you know where she is? I thought she'd be home. The last time I saw her, she was getting on the tram to meet Mike. She didn't meet Mike, Manni. She didn't get off the tram. Hey, Elizabeth, look. I'm sure she'll be fine. Manni, do you have any idea where she could be? No, sorry. [phone ringing] Box Hill Police Station. Hello. I want to report a missing person. My daughter, she's missing. Yep, okay. Can I just get your name and details, please, ma'am? Elizabeth Barber. My daughter's name is Rachel Barber. She's 15 years old. She was supposed to get off the tram. My husband was meant to pick her up, but she didn't. Something's happened. I know it. She hates the dark, and she hasn't rung. Okay, and how long has she been missing for, Mrs. Barber? About an hour and a quarter. You don't understand. My daughter is never late. She never disappears. So I'm not... I'm not overreacting. [tram bell dings] The last time I saw her was with Manni at the end of classes. Zoe, if anyone has seen or heard from her, can you call? Hold on. Absolutely. Let me know if there's anything I can do. Yes, I will. I will. [phone ringing] Rachel. Elizabeth? There's something I didn't tell you before. What? Rachel had a job tonight. A job? What job? I don't know. She didn't say. Where? With who? I don't know. You guys share the same diary. You talk to each other ten times a night. I don't understand, Manni. I'm calling the police. I'm calling everyone I can think of, and you lie to me. What's wrong with you? I'm sorry. Where did she go? What job? What did she say to you? She said she was gonna make a lot of money and not to worry, 'bause it was with an old friend. What friend? [mournful orchestral music] [car doors slamming shut] I've rung everyone I can think of. No one's seen her. Doesn't make sense, does it? She's in trouble, Mike. Enough, Liz. She's okay. You know Rachel. She probably just got off at the wrong tram stop, and she's wandering the street as we speak, lost. You two didn't have a fight, did you? Right. Well, let's not jump to any conclusions just yet, okay? We'll find her, most likely hungry and pissed off. Look, I'll... I'll go and look down Burwood Highway. She could have got off up there. That's great, Drew. Thanks, mate. Do you think maybe we should go and look around the dance school? [car horns honking] [knocking on door] Rachel? Rachel? [sirens wailing] Rachel? Rachel? [distorted whooshing and ringing sounds] [deep, echoing breaths] [light, haunting music] [tram bell rings] [car horns honking] You have to go back to Box Hill. We went to Box Hill this morning. They've got primacy of the investigation. Give them a chance to do something. Please, Rachel's very naive. We think she may have been... Well, Mike, you tell him. Go on. Oh, well, there's a brothel called Number 27, and this woman in a clothes shop just said to me that the brothel tries to get people in by giving them money and... We think she may have been kidnapped by this brothel. You see, Rachel did tell her boyfriend that she was going to make a lot of money, that she had a job with an older woman, so... Number 27's a legal brothel, one of the more reputable ones. Go back to Box Hill. Well, we have a poster that we've made up. Could you please put one up? There's a $70 fine for putting up posters illegally. Get permission first. They just don't believe us. They think she's run off with friends. Bob downstairs has got a mate in missing persons. I'll get him to call him. Oh, that would be great, wouldn't it, Mike? Rachel? I thought you wouldn't look. Don't do that. If someone's taken her, they probably dumped her bag in one of these things, haven't they? Mike, I'm sorry. I thought if you knew, you'd wait, and I thought we'd lose time, and I know that we have to find her. She's in trouble. I know. What did Manni say to you? He told me that she was going to meet an older woman, a friend, that she'd offered her money for a job. What older women does she know? I went through her phone book. I can't think of anyone. She's bloody done something stupid. She's not dead. I don't feel it. I'd know. We'd know. We'd know. I barely spoke to her yesterday. We'll find her. We'll find her. This is Detective Patterson here from missing persons. I received a call. Yes, well, young girls of this age tend to go missing all the time, Mrs. Barber. I'm sure it's quite unusual, but you're gonna have to trust me on... You're going to have to trust me on this one, Mrs. Barber. The statistics will back me up on this. She's only been gone a... Mrs. Barber, she's only been gone a... Okay, Mrs. Barber. Yes, I'm hearing you, yep. Okay. Mr. and Mrs. Barber? Mrs. Barber? Yes, can we wait? My husband's just gone to the car. We've left the mobile phone in the car. He can follow us up. Just so you understand, this type of report is not usually investigated by CIB. However, I have been asked to take a statement. [bell tolling] [baby crying] [speaking indistinctly] Fuck off. Okay. Can I wait for my husband, please? Oh, he can catch up. The toys... [phone ringing] [laughter] This'll be the third time this week. Yeah, he's doing all right. All he does is drink and go to football. Yeah. I'm sorry. Can you just tell me where my wife went, please? - Has she gone inside? - Just hold on. I just want you to find out where my wife is, please. Sir, calm down. I am calm. I just want to be with my wife now, please. Just want to check I've got everything. Ah, Mr. Barber. Where have you been? They wouldn't bring me up. To reiterate, there is simply no evidence of foul play. She wouldn't run away. Her bag is missing. Her favorite teddy bear is gone. I told you. She was offered a job. Someone has taken her. Or she might be out on the town having a good time. This happens every day. Not to us, it doesn't. [sighs] Well, there's not much else I can do. This poster you've made up, you've put your phone number on it. You'll get prank calls. Well, at this stage, any calls would be welcome. In fact, any help would be welcome. I understand you've been searching for her out on the street. Yeah, we have. Piece of advice. People that don't want to be found can't be found. It's an impossible task. I mean, you could walk around one corner of the street. At the same time, she could walk around another, and you've missed her by seconds. I suggest you get some rest. Go home. Come on. Oh, Mr. Barber? Have you looked under the house? So what if that woman was right? What if she was kidnapped by the brothel? Liz, enough. She'll be terrified. We'll go. Dom and I will check it out. She's alone. She could be hurt. Liz, you are not thinking clearly. You're exhausted. She could be in a hospital. She'll be fine. No one knows who she is. They don't know who we are. They can't contact us. Please, darling, a cup of tea? Mum, enough with the fucking cups of tea. - Oh. - [silverware clatters] Dad. Liz, I think we might take... [phone rings] Barber household? Sure, thanks. Yeah, I'll tell her. We'll take Ashleigh-Rose. We could use... I'm gonna get a torch. It's dark under the house. Liz? Oh, he's... he's looking for Rachel under the house. - She's under the house! - No! Sweetheart, the... the detective asked us to look under the house in case she's run away, and she was hiding there. - Oh, that's bullshit. - Rachel? Now, Drew, the policeman's only doing his job. Oh, for Christ's sake. Rachel, are you down here? [phone ringing, tea kettle whistling] Barber house? Rachel! [gasping lightly] [line ringing] [gasping] Mike? Mike? [gasping, panting] Oh, Mike, Mike. She's dead. She's not. She's dead. She's not. She's dead. Oh, God, she's dead. [wails] I love my children. I love my children. I love my children, and I love my wife. Mom! [sobbing] [whispers] It's okay, Daddy. [faint, echoing voices] [wind chimes jingling] Elizabeth? I could feel her here. There's a lot of memories. [distorted breathing noises] [sudden gasp] [whispering and rustling] [woman whispering indistinctly] It has begun. Life is torture... I get this ugly feeling inside me, and it forces me to do things, to scream, swear, and throw things. I am going to explode. The explosion is just gonna get bigger and bigger. [screaming] I hate myself! The wind rushes through my hair. I'm weightless, but fear cripples me. I'm suffocating. I cannot scream. Who are you? Help me. Oh, Daddy, please, help me. [pop music playing on radio] [computer keys clacking] Dear Dad. It's 9:23. I haven't done any homework these entire holidays, and I feel horrible. Dad, I don't want to go back to school. I hate it there. I don't fit in. They call me names: pizza face, stubby, big nose. I don't know why. I told Mum, but she hasn't helped. I have no friends. I used to think of you as my only friend, and sometimes you hurt me so badly inside, I wished you were dead. Here's a thought I had when I was angry. Good night, and I hope you had a nice day at work. Please, don't rip this note up. I want to keep it. But you can write back if you want to. [printer whirring] Love, Curly Top. I really, really, really, really, really need help. Good night. [motorcycle engine rumbling] [engine noise fades] [whimpers] [people speaking indistinctly] I don't care! I need that one now! All right, I will make you another one. Just go and watch TV. I'm hungry. [gasps] She rang him, you know? I mean, that's why he came. She told him I'd thrown all his stuff on the nature strip. I mean, I am trying, you know? But it's just so hard. Caroline makes Kate hate me. Caroline's so angry. The problems in this house are because of her. It's a difficult age. I was horrible to my mother. I just... I don't know what's gonna happen to me. And what will people think? Elizabeth, you wouldn't understand. In my social circle, divorced women are frowned upon. And my... my whole life is ruined. Look at me. I'm fat. I'm ugly. You'll be fine. You have the kids, the house. I'm sure David will look after you. But he doesn't care about us. She goes on and on about her father, wanting to live with him, and he doesn't... Hi, Elizabeth. Hi, Caroline. Dad was here. Yes, he was. Came and took his stupid motorbike. Why didn't he come see me? Because he was... he was in a hurry. He couldn't bear to stay, really. Couldn't bear you. God, I hope I don't turn out like you. Why don't you just let me go? Caroline, sweetheart... You don't care about me! You must have been my absolute worst fucking enemy in a past life! I hate you! Caroline, I can't take this anymore! [sobs] You can't take it? Well, fuck you. She's always been horrible. Shh. Even as a baby. Shh. Dear Mum, I know I'm not the perfect child you wanted. I am the most fat, ugly, selfish, cursed thing. You should have had an abortion. You just put your arms around her. She'll come back to you. No, she won't. You don't understand. She writes these letters. They're so overwhelming. There's so much unhappiness. I just don't know what to do. [sobbing] [wailing] Gail, why don't you come over to our house? I have to finish dinner for the kids. It will burn. Then I'll make you a fresh cup of tea. [wailing and screaming] [panting, sobbing] [flames crackling] [children laughing] [peaceful acoustic music] # Got your eyes open # # But you cannot see # # Got what you want to # # You've got what you need # # Till one day you see something # # You cannot be # # Telling you, girl # # Yes, you better beware # # Her papa loved her so much # # You could see # # Oh, oh, oh # # I loved her too much # Are you watching? # If you know what I mean # [plane engine roaring] [mellow music] Caroline, just chill. It'll be fun. Nothing's better than a wedding. Take my advice and just get pissed. Trust me, guys love a bridesmaid. Janice, you know I don't wear dresses, and I can't wear dresses. I won't look any good. Fuck, mate, you'll be fine. A bit of lippy, you'll look great. It's not just the dress. I don't want to celebrate Dad's marriage to her. So wear pants. Actually, there's some real nice ones at Sportsgirl at the moment, and he's paying for them. Roscoe, the usual, thanks. [complicated acoustic riff] Come on, girlfriend. I'm gonna leave early today. I've got a specialist appointment for Susie. Can you make sure that... [people murmuring indistinctly, phones ringing] You know, Irene, I just changed my medication, and it makes you feel really tired and sick. Maybe that's all that's wrong with Susie. I'm sure she's okay. She's real lucky to have you as a mother. Oh, Caroline, I didn't realize... I mean, that's not something I discuss. It's personal. It's not a dirty secret, is it? You love your daughter. You okay? My stupid specialist doesn't know what's wrong. They think I make it up. I think we should put your condition in your personnel file. What if you have an episode? How do you do it? You manage a job, a husband, two kids, and you're happy. Unlike my family. All they care about is themselves. He kicked me out. You'd never do that. You know that's not true. Your father, he helped you find your flat. He didn't kick you out. Only because he didn't want me with him. Well, he's taking you to the Grand Prix this weekend, isn't he? Yeah, yeah, he is. I just... Just if he was just proud of me, thought I could do something, be better. Oh, Caroline. But I will. It will be painful, difficult. I'll change. What are you doing tonight? Not much. Maybe go to my acting workshop. Cool, because we're all going to the pub for karaoke night. I've got me new shit-hot Kylie push-up bra. I'm ready. I'm pumped. Oh, far out. Do you guys mind if I get going? I've got to go get a bus. Hey, Caroline, can I ask you a favor? See, I've got all these fucking parking fines, and they're due today, and I was thinking that you could lend me the money, just till next pay? Okay, how much? Not much, mate. Just 300 bucks. But it's due today. Is that all right? Great. Thanks, Caroline. Well, I'm off. Are you going to come? No. I just keep dreaming that one day, everything will be perfect, as perfect as things can be. I want to be happy. I want a life. I want to show everyone that has hurt me that I can succeed, can change. Rachel Elizabeth Barber. Rachel Elizabeth Barber. [whispering] Let run barefoot in the country. Began dancing very young. I remember the first time I saw you. You were incandescent. Our destinies entwine. Irene's in the loo. Brad said she had a fucking fit. Caroline? Irene, can I come in? Janice, can you go and sit with her? I'm going to call her dad, see if he'll come and get her. She's okay now. She's a bit dazed, but that's normal. Yeah, sure. Did you see it? No, Karen just found her in the bathroom, slumped on the floor. No one did, did they? I've never seen one of those things. Good job I got the money. Be quiet. Janice, look after her. What? [sirens wailing] Caroline, I think you should take your coat off. You're hot. Do you want me to pull over? I really think you should take it off. I'm going to pull over and help you. No. [light switch clicking] Come on. Take this off. That's better. Go ahead, lie down. Can I speak to David Reid, please? It's important. I'd really appreciate it if you put me through. It's an emergency. Yes, I'll hold. Right. It's just that I'm the office manager, and I've been with his daughter waiting for him for quite some time. Yep. All right. I'll wait. Thank you. Oh, Mr. Reid. She's asleep now. She told me she changed her medication, so perhaps you want to make sure she's taking the correct dosage. What was your name again? Irene Thompson. I'm Caroline's boss. Thank you, Mrs. Thompson. I'm sure you're required back at the office. Actually, I have an appointment, which I'm now late for. Caroline, you awake? You woke me up. [sighs] This is disgusting. When was the last time you cleaned up this place? Dad, I had a fit at work. It was really embarrassing. You taking the correct medication? Yeah, but I'm overwrought, you know? I've got a lot of pressure on me at the moment. Caroline, you are always overwrought. Maybe if you took better care of yourself and your things, maybe you'd feel better. Why did it take you so long to get here? Why couldn't you come pick me up? I had a meeting. I can't just drop everything every time you have a problem. That's all I am to you, a problem! I had a fit, and you couldn't be bothered! I'm your daughter! You're supposed to care! I had the fucking fit because of you! Christ's sake. You don't care! I'm sick of being made to suffer! Telling me I'm selfish! That is crap, Caroline. That is crap. It's your stupid wedding's fault! Wear a dress? How can I? [sobbing] Look at me. Look at me. You look fine. You look fine. Nothing will ever change. You love that ugly bitch. I'm sorry I'm not perfect. You hate me. Caroline, please. Please, don't. - Look at me! - Don't! Look at my face! I have a big nose! Look at my disgusting skin! My hair is oily and dirty and horrible! Look at my teeth! They're yellow! Look at my disgusting body. It's white, and it's fat. I have rolls of fat. Even my legs are short and stubby. My lips are yucky. Small, beady eyes. I hate myself! I hate everything! I'm trapped in this ugly body! It's ugly, ugly! I hate me! [sobbing] Come and lie down. Come and lie down. Thank you. Come on. I'll call Dr. McLesky. You have to go and see him. I'll never fit in, because I am what I am, and nothing is going to change. Caroline. You have to think positive thoughts. Think about the farm. Maybe we could go up there soon. You have to stop this. You got to try. You got to try. Just try for me. I'll clean up, Dad, when I feel better. I've just been so busy, you know? I know. I know, Curly Top, I know. Thanks, Dad. I'm sorry I'm so much trouble. You don't deserve a daughter like me. I'm so sorry. It'll be all right. It'll be all right. I have to go. [sobbing] [phone beeping] Yeah, hi, it's me. Yeah, I'm sorry, darling. Why don't I meet you there? Yeah, ten minutes, tops. [pencil scratching] Rachel Elizabeth Barber, born on 12 September, William Angliss Hospital. Rachel was always wild, let run barefoot in the country, began dancing very young, very talented. Strikingly attractive, dancer's body. Very clear, pale skin. Hypnotic brown eyes. [haunting, ethereal music] Rachel, will you be my best friend? Rachel? Remember, she's highly gifted, intelligent. Hi, Rachel, it's Caroline. I've got that job for you. It's a psychological test from my company, and I thought of you. It's great money, $500 for a couple of hours. $300, and you get clothes and travel money. It's easy, but there's a condition. It's strictly confidential. It's highly confidential. You know, ethics, that sort of stuff? I'm not allowed to give the results to anyone for the study... the research to work properly. I'm not... It's confidential. You can't tell anyone, not your parents or Manni, or it won't work. We could do it after your tap class. I'm free Monday night. We could meet at Flinders Street Station. No, think. There are cameras there. I'll meet you at... Bridge Road. I need you to pack a bag as if you were running away. I need to see what you would take if you were going to run away, you know, ID, money, ballet shoes, photos, that sort of thing, for the research. It won't take long. Then afterwards, you can tell. You can tell later. Remember, it's a secret. [chiming xylophone music] I want them so much. I want to buy them. Guess what. I'm going to buy them tomorrow. In your dreams, babe. That's, like, 300 bucks. You haven't even got enough money for tram tickets. Oh, yeah? Well, I'm going to buy them tomorrow, because I've got a job tonight. A job? What kind of job? Oh, I can't really say, you know? I said I wouldn't. You can't say? Since when? It... [sighs] What? It's... the job is... Well, it's confidential. That's all I can really say right now. But I can tell you everything afterwards. I mean, that's part of the deal. No, I don't understand this. I mean, what kind of job is confidential, huh? What have you got yourself into? It... I'm not stupid. It's nothing immoral, and I get free clothes. Look, Rachel, this is not right. Now, what the fuck are you doing? Where are you going? Manni, I'm just going to do this job. I'm gonna get some money, and then I'm going to come back and buy my shoes. I'll come with you, then. [sighs] Three, four, five... Rach, you still want a lift to Bridge Road? No, I'm gonna walk. What are you going there for? Oh, I'm going to take the tram, and Dad's going to pick me up. Isn't that the wrong way? So do you want a lift or not? No, it's fine. Really, it's fine. Okay. I mean, you're sure you don't want a lift? You hate walking. Come on! Call me. I love you! I love you! Come on. [tram engine idling and stopping] Oh, thank you so much, Caroline, for getting me to do this. I mean, you have no idea how good it would be to have a little bit of money to take Manni out, the two of us, you know, because it's always his mum or my mum, and we never get any time together, just me and him and... Come on. [tram rattling] Food okay? Oh, yeah. I'm a pig. I was starving. You've got no idea what dancing does to you. It's like, I just can't get enough food into me, you know? Tell you what, if you wanted to lose weight, you should just dance. Before we start, I need you to relax. Okay. I know some relaxation techniques that will help. I'll put a splash of vodka in our drinks. No, I don't think so. Come on, Rach. One drink won't hurt. I know I'm not very good at relaxing, but I've got to go home, you know? Your parents? Well, no, but it's a school night. Rach, maybe this is not a good idea. I'm only supposed to interview people who are over 18, people who can make their own decisions. I do make my own decisions. I do. I don't want to get you in trouble with your mum. Oh, come on. You know Mum. She thinks I'm still a child. They just can't accept you've grown up. Must be really hard on you. She just loves me. That's all. I bet she doesn't know you as well as she thinks she does. She'd kill me if she knew some of the stuff I do. Can we please keep going? Please? You want that drink? It's hard to find the right people, gifted people like you. Well, you should talk to Manni. He's so gorgeous. You have to meet him. You know, I don't know what I'd do without him, you know? I mean, we're soul mates. We were born to find each other. I love him so much. Here, try this. So, Caroline, are you ready? Do you mind if I call my dad first? I'm going to the Grand Prix, and I need to talk to him. Sure. I've... I've got those clothes there for you, if you want to try them on. See what you want to take home. Awesome. I think they're your size. The bathroom's through there. Hi, Dad. It's me, Caroline. I'm just calling because... can you pick me up on Saturday? Okay. I had the day off again today. My head... I'm anxious. Caroline, these clothes are fantastic. I actually wanted some of these. How cool is that? I'm confused. Well? What do you reckon? I think I look pretty good. Dad, I have to go. Bye. You're perfect. Thank you so much. Manni's gonna love these. Do you reckon I could call Mum quickly? I reckon I've tortured them enough. They'll be freaking out. Mum will have called the cops by now. Called the cops? That's a bit extreme, isn't it? Yeah, well... [sighs] I kind of lied. See, I told Dad to pick me up hours ago, and me and Mum had this massive fight, and then she was yelling at me and telling me to grow up, and I... I just feel really bad. Rachel, sit down. I reckon what you're doing is good. It will make them think twice. I don't know. Rach, I just want to get this done, okay? Yeah, sorry, Caroline. What do you want me to do? Close your eyes. That's it. Take deep breaths. Think of something beautiful. [exhales] Have you got something in your mind? Manni. And we're dancing. Concentrate on your breathing. Breathe in. Breathe out. Breathe in. Breathe out. Breathe in. Breathe out. Breathe in. Breathe out. Still dancing, and Manni is there. [breathing slowly, evenly] [choking and gasping] Ah! [gasping, wheezing] [yelps] [gasping] [grunts] [panting] [panting] [chokes] [gasping] [rope strains] [wheezes] [whimpers] [choking] [grunts] [rope straining] [coughs] [growls] [groans] [gasping] [haunting music box music] [thunder rumbling, rain pattering] 7:15, get up, shower, wash hair, get dressed. 8:30, go to work. Cancel Gelique appointment. 9:30, ask Janice if she wants to move in with me. Where's my wallet? My ID? [dragging and scraping] [groaning] [grunts] [panting] [sobbing] Ohh! Ahh! [wailing] No! No! No! No! [sighs] [sequins jingling] I am a wild, free spirit. I live on the edge. I am passionate and highly talented, moody, and mysterious. Fuck you! You are ugly, pizza face! Look it! Just look at you now! [gasping] Please, don't be angry with me. Today was the end of my life. There are so many things that ended it. You only know a fraction. But I swear till I'm dead that today was the end of my life. [swelling orchestral music] [keys clicking] Yes, hello, I just want to inquire if you have any trains going to Sydney today? What time? How much is a ticket? Okay, thank you. Bye. Caroline? You feeling better? I've changed. You don't look so well. I'm new. [phone ringing] [ringing continues] [line ringing] Not me, not there. [car brakes squeal] Elizabeth? Elizabeth? Now, just let her talk. Don't force the information out of her and don't get your hopes up, okay? Now, Jenny, you haven't seen Rachel in a long time. Are you sure it was her? Yeah, I saw her recently. She was with her new boyfriend, Manni. She was drunk. Oh, not Rachel. She doesn't drink. Well, you could have fooled me. She was all over her boyfriend. So it was definitely Rachel on the tram? Of course. You can't mistake Rachel. I noticed her because she was with this really gross-looking girl. She could have been fat too. She was too fat to dance. That's for sure. And how did Rachel seem? Was she okay? Yeah, they looked like friends. I heard her talking about that new boyfriend of hers and something about getting a cat? Her new kitten. Where? Where did she get off? She was last seen around here. Excuse me? Uh, excuse me, I was wondering if you'd take one of these. This is our daughter. She's gone missing. She was last seen around here... Excuse me. If you see this girl anywhere, could you call this number? Sure. Thanks. We have a sighting, a young woman who saw Rachel on the tram the day that she disappeared, with another girl. Now, I realize that we disagree about the reasons for Rachel's disappearance, but can you please talk to Jenny? This young girl, was she behaving in a threatening manner to Rachel at all? No, she said they seemed friendly. [exhales] You are aware that your daughter was having a sexual relationship with her boyfriend, hmm? And she could be pregnant. And if she is, maybe she ran away because she was frightened of what you might think. Don't presume to tell me about my daughter. The press believe us. They want to do a story on Rachel. [scoffs] Well, they must be short of a story. Short of a story? This is not a fucking story. This is our life. My daughter's life. She's been missing for nine fucking days, and you've done nothing. Now, just sit down, Mrs. Barber. I will not sit down. How good would it look to the press if I told them how hopeless you were, how fucked you are? All we want is for you to talk to Jenny. Is that too much to ask? You know what? It is. Now, you've had more than your fair share of police resources. I got real crime to deal with. You've done nothing! Nothing? You have been here day and night for the past eight days, harassing hardworking policemen, making demands. We have investigated. Our investigation has found nothing, nothing other than a 15-year-old girl who has probably... no, almost certainly run away. Jesus. Oh! [phone rings] Barber household. Hello, is Elizabeth there? No, sorry. Can I take a message? I just heard about Rachel, and I was ringing up to see if there's anything I can do, if I could help. Good on you. I'll let Elizabeth know. Can I have your name? Caroline Reid. We were neighbors in Mont Albert. Who am I talking to? Sorry, it's Drew. Oh, hi, Drew. You're Elizabeth's brother. Are there any ideas where she is, what happened? No. No, nothing. She just went to a dance thing, and they haven't seen her since. Have you told the police? Bunch of idiots. They still think she's run away. That's terrible. Surely, when someone goes missing, the police have to look. No. Not unless there's foul play or something suspicious. Is there anything suspicious? Well, apart from the fact that she vanished, they say no. Supposedly, this happens all the time, you know? Young girls running away. So you don't think she has. No way. No way. It's just... it's been too long, you know? It's okay, Drew. That was insensitive of me. So what are you going to do? Just keep looking. That's where Elizabeth and Mike are now. They're out looking for her. Let me know if you need me to look. Maybe I can hand out posters or something. I'll let them know, all right? Rachel was a wonderful person. Oh, and wish Elizabeth a happy birthday for me. Thanks. Bye, Drew. Mr. and Mrs. Barber? Elizabeth. David DePyle, missing persons unit. Okay, I've made some inquiries, and I do have to tell you that this case does fall a long way out of the normal criteria for a missing person. There's no suspicious disappearance or foul play. There appears to be nothing untoward about the case, but I have to tell you that in all my time at missing persons, I've never seen an effort like this. This is extraordinary. She didn't run away. She was really happy. She had a boyfriend. She was dancing. Elizabeth, I believe you. I do. I believe you. Thank you. Thank you. I understand the press have picked the story up? Yeah, it was a lot easier convincing them than the bloody police. Oh, he doesn't mean you. He means... No offense taken. But I made a call to Australia's Most Wanted. They will do a story, but they need to interview you. That... that's wonderful. Thank you. When? When? Tomorrow. The best thing you can do right now is to go home. You both need rest. Oh, no. No, no, that's what other police have told us to do, and if we'd stopped then, we wouldn't have found Jenny and the press, and we wouldn't be talking to you. But you are. You must let me take some of the load for you. You're both exhausted. Sleep and food will reenergize you. If we're to go on this journey together, I need you to be fresh. I have resources, and I will have questions. I need to know where you are. If anyone can find Rachel, I can. [phones ringing] Steve, listen, did you get the email I sent you? Rachel Barber? Yeah, 15. Yeah, just with the parents. They're devastated. Imagine if Lizzie had been missing. I need a favor. Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'll get the warrant. Soon. Well, I wouldn't ask unless... I'm just worried about this one. Something's not right. Thanks. Number is 356-7809, incoming and outgoing. Thanks.

Well, given you're the missing persons analyst, don't you think you should have kept us informed? Informed about what? The way I see it, you already spoke to the parents, and in your opinion, it's not a missing persons case. That was ten days ago... Well, gentlemen, it is now. Now, Patterson, I want you to get down to the Richmond police station with your crew and take over. Righto, boss. Now, what the fuck have you been doing? Over the last few days, I've been making a few unofficial inquiries, but it's led to nothing. - So Patterson's right? - No. I can find anyone or at least something that leads me to another lead, but I've got nothing. Nothing's not much help. But there is a sighting. Look, let's keep it simple. I want you to compile a Photofit and get it circulated, and I want you to keep him informed. Do you understand? Yes. Righto, boss. Huh, well, then? The mystery disappearance of a young dance student. I want my family to be like it was before, basically that. We want Rachel to come back. She's missed. She goes, you know, "I'm off to do this job where, "you know, I'll earn heaps of money "and receiving heaps of clothes, and I'll call you after. " Rachel, in fact, never made the call, never told anyone what the job was or who she was going to meet. Good girl. The last reported sighting of Rachel was around 6:45, where Rachel and an unknown dark-haired girl hopped off the tram here at the Windsor tram stop. Fuck! The family say their 15-year-old... Fuck! Fuck, fuck, fuck! We have to find this other girl. That's key to what's going on. She may still have run away... Yeah, that's right. She ran away. And chosen not to be in touch with her family and friends, or she may be held against her will... No, she came to me. To me. We just don't know. If she could get in contact with us, she would. But she hasn't. She didn't tell. She trusted me. They believe she's being held against her will, and they're pleading for her safe return. No, she's safe, but she's gone. Also if you know the identity of the dark-haired girl, please, contact your local police station. Thoroughly clean house and steam-clean carpet. Call work sick. Get loan. Withdraw all money. Call Dad for a trip. Dye hair. Catch 8:05 p.m. train to Sydney. If necessary, sleep in Como Park. Pack bags. Cancel beautician's appointment. Quit work. Cut phone and electricity.

Apparently, one of the Barber children is missing. That's terrible. How? It's in all the papers. Didn't you do a... a school project on Rachel? Ages ago. Have you heard anything? No. Why would I? I know she's done this before. I reckon she'll turn up. She always was a free spirit. Now, listen. Your mother, I don't appreciate getting calls from that woman. She called here hysterical. She said, apparently, you wrote her a very threatening letter. Is that right? You said you'd do something violent to her. She's a fucking bitch. I can't believe you'd take her side. Caroline, for Christ's sake. Oh, fuck you. I don't need this. Caroline? Caroline? [sobbing] Patterson? I have that reverse phone record. It's in the right area where Rachel was last seen. Come on. Come on. Address is flat ten, [knocking at door] Hello? Anyone there? Is a Caroline Robertson there? It's the police. Open up. [phone ringing] Hello, you've called Caroline. Please, leave a message. [answering machine beeps] This is Detective Patterson here, Ms. Robertson. If you're in the flat, can you please come to the front door? We are looking for a Rachel Barber, and we believe that you can help us with her whereabouts. When you get this message, can you please call me? I've left my card under the door. Thank you. [phone ringing] Hello, you've called Caroline. Please, leave a message. Hello, Caroline, it's Irene. I hope you're okay. I just need to let you know that I will need a doctor's certificate. Can you call me back? Thanks. Bye. She changed her name: Caroline Reid Robertson. It used to be just Reid, Caroline Reid. The Barbers know a Caroline Reid. She works at Phone Tel, I'll check it out. DePyle, can you bring the Barbers in? So you wouldn't say that Rachel and Caroline were friends? - No, not at all, no. - Not good friends. But did Rachel ever visit the Reid's holiday house? In Kilmore? No, no, why? Don't think so. Did she? Just thinking of simple leads. [phone ringing] Please, don't get your hopes up. This often happens, and it can come to nothing. Excuse me. Steve. But... Yeah, yeah, good. At least if she's with Caroline, she's okay. Mary, I really need the rest of that money today. Can you bring it round at lunchtime? I know I said pay it later, but I have a date tonight. Wow, that's amazing. Yeah, amazing. Look, sorry, babe, I'm broke. Okay, sure. Forget it, doesn't matter. Can I help you? [phone ringing] Hello, you've called Caroline. Please leave a message. Caroline, it's me, Mary. Pick up. Come on. I know you're there. Pick up. Hi, Mary. Hey, you'll never guess what. The cops are here looking for you. - How come? - I don't know. Something about that missing girl. Do you know anything about it? Yeah, I guess I used to babysit her. She's just run away, you know? I don't know. The TV reckons... they said something happened to her. Look, Mary, I've got a doctor's appointment, so I'll call you later. Okay, but you will tell me what the cops say? Awesome. [phone ringing] Hello? Caroline. The police were just here looking for you. They're looking for that missing girl. I think you should ring them. They must have come round when I was at the doctor. Thanks, Irene. I'll call them. I've got to go. I can hear someone at the door. Sir, I'm currently investigating the disappearance of Rachel Barber. Telephone records show that Caroline spoke to Rachel for an hour the night she disappeared. Can you think of any reason why she would call her? None at all. You noticed anything unusual about your daughter? Detective, my daughter is always different. Could Rachel be staying with Caroline? I don't know. Can you think of anywhere Rachel may be, anywhere she and Caroline may go? Well, I have a farm. Sir? At Kilmore. And she may be there? I don't know. Do you know if Caroline was close to Rachel Barber? I doubt it. My daughter doesn't have many friends. She's... she's a bit of a loner. Not to mention that Rachel's considerably younger. She did do a school project on Rachel, but that was years ago. Our relationship is... strained. Did you see your daughter around the time that Rachel Barber went missing, the 1st of March? I did, yes. I did see her then. I visited her flat. I was... I was worried about her. She has epilepsy. And I remember it clearly, because... because the bedroom door was closed, which is unusual. Do you think Rachel Barber was there? Oh, I don't know. Detective, my daughter's very... Well, she's quite odd and strange. She suffers from depression, and I have to tell you that after what you've said, I'm deeply concerned. [sirens wailing] [men shouting] [knocking on door] Caroline Robertson? This is the police. Open up. We suspect that Rachel Barber is on the premises. Open up. This is the police. [knocking at door] Open the door now. [officers speaking indistinctly] Police. Open the door now. Open up! I'm not here. Not here. Ms. Robertson, please, open the front door. This is the police. - Take a look for us? - No worries. Organize some boys at the end of the street and around the corner. We don't want her coming back and getting spooked. I'll call the boss. Anything? Yes, it's dark, but there is someone in here lying on the floor, appears unconscious. Gain entry and open the front door for us. Can you hear me? Looks like she was leaving. Open your eyes. Caroline? Caroline, can you hear me? Boss, got a note here about an 8:05 train to Sydney tonight. We need to check it. Barber could be on it. I'm Caroline's father. Mr. Reid. We found her like this. Pills all over the floor. Can you tell us anything? This is symptomatic of an epileptic fit. I think she's had a fit, and it will take a while to recover. Caroline? Do we know anything? Can you tell me what happened? I found her like this, lying on the floor. Take a look at these. No cause for tremendous concern. - Excuse me. - I don't know. Is she an epileptic? Yes, she is. She is. Now, I want you to go with Robertson to the hospital. - And you are? - I'm the girl's father. I need you to be there when she comes to. - All right. - Her name is Caroline. Caroline? Can you hear me? Are you with us? Caroline? You know where you are? [inhales] Caroline, this is very, very serious. We have to talk. [breathing shakily] Look at me. Look at me. You listen to me. I've had enough, do you understand? Yeah, I've had enough. I am sick of cleaning up your messes. Do you understand me? Do you understand? Mr. Reid... [speaking indistinctly] No, actually, I... I don't think she's well enough to answer questions at the moment. I'll wait. The possibility was an overdose of Tegretol, but there is no irregular heartbeat. Mr. Reid, you suggested she may be in a postictal state. I can't confirm this yet. I still have numerous tests to do. Thank you. I appreciate it, Doctor. I have some other business to attend to, so... Well, I'll be doing that. Excuse me. Postictal? It's the transient period of sleepiness and confusion after an epileptic seizure. It will be a while before you can talk to her. Yeah, got that already. Sir, perhaps Barber will come back here. I mean, we have her clothes. It looks like she was staying with Reid. I'm not so certain. I think this is bad. [footsteps approaching] Mr. Reid? Call me David, please, Detective. David. Neil. I'd appreciate it if you would ask Caroline where Rachel's hiding. Absolutely. Could she be at your farm in Kilmore? Possibly. Could they have gone away together? Maybe Caroline helped Rachel run away from home? No, I don't think so. Excuse me. I've finished all the tests. The blood work shows she may have some sort of infection. Apart from that, there appears to be nothing wrong with her. [sighs] Hello, Curly Top. Caroline, that man over there is a detective, and he wants to talk to you about Rachel... Where she is. I don't want to talk to him, Daddy, please. I told him that you would talk to him. You must tell him where Rachel is. You must. You'll be the daughter I always wanted you to be, okay? Make me proud. Okay, Daddy. I'm sorry. I'm sorry I'm so much trouble. My daughter wrote these, and I think you'll find they're very disturbing. They may be of some use. You may talk to her now. Hi, Caroline. Can you hear me? Yes. My name's Neil. I'm a policeman. Do you understand that? Yes. I'm going to ask you some questions about Rachel Barber, okay? Yes. Do you know where Rachel is? Dead. She's dead. How did that happen? It was an accident. I killed her. Are you positive she's dead, or can we still help her? No, she's dead. Do you know where her body is? At the farm. At Kilmore? Yes. Where is she? [chimes jingling] Near the trees. Who helped you? Can't remember. How did she die? Can't remember. [sighs] Oh, hi, come in. I'm sorry. There's no easy way to tell you this. We've found Rachel. She's been murdered. Who killed her? Caroline Reid Robertson. Caroline? Are you sure? Yes, she's been charged with Rachel's murder. I wish we didn't know. I wish we hadn't tried so hard. Wish she was still a missing person. No, the not knowing, you wouldn't want that. And was she stabbed? I'm sorry. We can't tell you that. Was it violent? All I can tell you is that the murder weapon was found on her body. Can we see her? There needs to be an autopsy. [melancholy acoustic music] [rain pattering] [wind chimes jingling] Oh, Mummy, I've lost my baby. I know, darling. I know. [sobbing] Shh... Daddy, it's my fault. Don't say that, sweetheart. If I wasn't friends with her sister, Caroline wouldn't have met Rachel, and Rachel would still be here. We were all friends with them. We lived across the road from them. Daddy didn't know. It's not your fault, little one. I hope it didn't hurt when she died. [sobbing] [wind whistling] [solemn orchestral music] [melancholy orchestral rock music] [deep, echoing breaths] [bells ringing] [ringing reverberating] This is the story of my death. They say I died that day. That wasn't me that died. That was someone else. My path is clear. I've become who I was meant to be. [peaceful acoustic music] # Got your eyes open # # But you cannot see # # Got what you want to # # You've got what you need # I'm gonna grow my hair to my feet.
