When he was not | selling tripe, he would lie | on his back in solitude and stare at the clouds | for hours and hours. Sometimes he would | just lie there and watch the way the wind | blew a piece of paper. One day as he was roaming around looking | for things to stare at he saw this boat | on the riverbank. There was a boy in it, | very sick and weak from hunger. His name was Sipho, | and he had no parents. Madiba gave him food to eat and a blanket | that kept him warm. Since that day, Madiba and Sipho became | very, very close friends. Shit! Is he dead? Hey, man, he's saying | hello to God. Gimme that. Yes! Hello. Check it out. Check this out, bro! Take it. Please, let me see. No, I'm fine on my own. | Stop it. You are so stingy. Yeah. - Holla. | - Benny, my man. - How you doing, man? | - Fine, man. - Hi, Louise. | - Hello, Benny. - Madiba. | - How is it? It's fine, man. That looks cool. Where'd you get it? Secret, bro. | Stop it! It's nice, man. Is that for real? As real as me | and you, bro. Check it out. Jeez, it's heavy, man. I know. | Check this out! Jeez. One bullet? What are you | gonna do with one bullet, Sipho? Show you what | I'll do with one bullet. Sit down, Benny. Sit down, man, and relax. | Sit down. See this bullet? See it? I'm just gonna put it in here. There's five holes | in here-- five. Come on, then. | And go like this-- First bullet. Second. Sipho! | Stop it, man. - Three! | - Are you mad? Four. We're getting there, Benny! Last one. | It's coming, coming! See? Only thing | you need is a gun, bullet or no bullet. You're crazy. Let's get out of here. I can get used to this. So, Madiba, | what do you think? It looks great, bro. Okay. - Can I try, then? | - Yeah, yeah. No problem. This is gonna work. - It's perfect, man. | - Okay. There you go. Madiba, please | film me, please! Hello! - Hello! | - Stop it, Louise. Hello! Please, Madiba, | just shoot me! Louise. - Is everything okay? | - Cool, man. It's good. Good. That's what I'm talking about. That is great. - Hello! | - I've got to find a job here. It's good, good. Hey, why aren't you at school? It's school holidays, papa. You forgot. But school keeps | you away from mischief. You're on TV, dad. That's a toy, man. Tell the camera | where you come from. I come from Port Elizabeth, | in New Brighton. Why did you | become an actor? I became an actor... because I loved it, I wanted to be an actor, I wanted to appear as the Richard Burtons and the Roger Moores | and you name them. You name them. I've arrived, yes, yes! Whenever Mr. Shawn | came to the township, everyone ran after him and wanted to show him | their talent. He taught music | and other things, as well. But he made everyone | feel special. Hey, filmmaker! People liked him | very, very much. - Right here. | - Hello. Madiba, doesn't this | wooden camera look great? Hey, man, I love it. It's cool. Hey, look at me. | Don't I look so fabulous? Look at me, Benny. Yeah, whatever. At least I'm in the picture. | Not like you. Listen, if it wasn't for me, you wouldn't be here, | so I wouldn't talk. Actually, talk to the hand, the face is busy. That's great. Anyway, guys, | where's this place? This is our township, man. Check. That's Tembiso's house. Isn't that his grandmother? No, it's his mother. The township? How can you film | the township? What is there to film? Madiba, man, film me! I give you a story, man! No, man, | I'm happy with what I've got. Man, I promise you | a masterpiece! Masterpiece! Man, the battery's low. | And there's no tape left. Erase that shit. No, man. | I don't want to. Madiba, man. Okay, let's make a deal. What? You film me now | and then we'll go to Cape Town. I get you new tapes, | new batteries. Ya, let's go | to Cape Town, please, guys? Please, please? Let the games begin! This is my home! Cape Independent for 2.80. | Cape Independent for 2.80. Cape Independent for 2.80. Get your Cape Independent | for 2.80! Is that a little Chinese-- | Oh, okay. Really? Fascinating! Let me have a look. You can wrap it. - No chips on it whatsoever. | - I see, perfect. - I'll take it. | - Will that be cash? - There we go. | - Bye, bye. Estelle, we don't | throw money away. I wasn't throwing it away! | I was giving it to him. - Just get into the car. | - I wasn't doing anything wrong. Why do you | always have to argue? - I'm not arguing with you. | - Get into the car. Okay, Benny, slow down. - Slow down. | - Okay. - Yeah. | - Good, I like this, man. - Okay, okay. | - Okay, I got it. - It's too bumpy here. | - Where, here? Okay, hold on, hold on. Yeah. Careful. Push, Benny! Push! Whatever I do, don't stop. Madiba didn't tell | anybody about Estelle. I guess he thought people would start | talking about them. He didn 't tell me, | of all people. I guess he thought | I had a big mouth. But I love my brother and I'll do anything for him. Guys, guys-- | Come here. Come here, come here. Have you got a pin? No. Benny, have you got a pin? Benny, have you got a pin? Yah, yah. Wait. Boy, Benny Boy. Always quick | with the your hands. I'm fine. With a gun in your hand, you and me can kick | this city around. No, no, no. Don't even think about it. Benny, if you're afraid to die, you're afraid to live, boy. Give that, give that, | give that! What about this? Holla. That's our share | you got there. Says who? | Baby, come on. The BX-5. Sure. All right. 50-50. Sure, sure. My new partners. Sure, sure. I share business with you. Pass it to your pals. Ah, man. They're a bunch | of priests, man. They don't touch this thing. Hey, it's bad, hey. | Hey, some bad shit. It's a nice thing, | you've got there. Can I see it? Don't you ever | do that again, man. Don't you ever! Let's go, guys. Someone left his book here. If the object was | to humiliate me, you've done a damn, good job. What did I do wrong? You can't put | a dead bird on the table. - We were having lunch. | - We were having lunch! I was just trying | to make a point-- that we all live once, | but die twice. The first time you die | is physical. The second time is, | when you're forgotten. What's wrong with that? I wasn't trying | to humiliate anybody. - Benny, you're hurting, man. | - Ow, Benny. Calm down. Calm down. Madiba. You must come clean now. What the fuck have you | brought us here for? Watch my camera, man! I'm tired now and I can't walk any farther. We've been walking all day! | What have you brought us here for? I'm just looking. Just looking? Yeah...for things. What things? Interesting things to film. - And what about that book? | - What book? You've been hiding that book | for the whole day! It's nothing. | It's just a book. - Let me have a look. | - No. We share, remember? Come on, we can't | share everything. Don't be stupid. Where did you get it? From the shops. Since when do you buy books? And where did you | get the money? It's my book. - It's your book? | - Yeah, I gave it to him. Now you know. You gave it to him? That's what I said. | Are you deaf, or what? I gave it to him! | Do you get it now? You gave it to him? Fine. | You gave it to him. If any one of you is lying-- If any one of you is lying-- If any one of you-- Don't try me, Madiba. Don't try me. Come on! | Stop it now, man! Sipho, you're not funny. Oh, come on, man. Don't be stupid. It's too dangerous. Okay. Don't be stupid. | Let's go get something to eat. I'm starving. That's the best thing | you ever said. - Isn't it, guys? | - Come, Madiba. You go ahead. I'll stay here | and do my thing. I've got a news flash for you. I want you to | go to your room and stay there | for the rest of the day. While you're there, | I want you to consider your behavior, young lady. You understand me? She's got her music lesson | this afternoon. Not anymore. Hello, Harold. They're gonna | put up your 20 million. You're home early, Nunu. So full of crap! Hi. I have been riding | all around the city looking for you. Hi, I'm Estelle. So, did you like the book? Ah, the secret book! You don't speak English, | do you? I speak English. My name is Sipho. Madiba's one of | my great friends. He's a little bit shy, though. But he's cool. He doesn't look that shy. Second thoughts-- You're right. So, do you guys live | in Cape Town? Nah. I live all over-- everywhere. But my friends live | in Khayelitsha. Oh, we pass by it sometimes, | on the highway. But we can only see | the rooftops. - I can take you there, if you want. | - Shut up. My music teacher-- | Mr. Shawn-- he's always there. Do you know him-- | Mr. Shawn? I have a lesson with him now. | Wanna come? I'll go with you. - Madiba doesn't know the city. | - Says who? I know the city. Come, let's go. Nice. Hello, Monique. | Did you practice last night-- - Your flute? | - Yes, I did. - Really? | - Really. Good, good. - Ah, Estelle. | - Hello. Ah, Mr. Filmmaker. Is it real? Can I see it? Sometime, maybe? Where is your cello? My mom said | that I could ride over. Well, then, you'll just have to use mine. Go in. Come on. I'm coming. Hello. So...now. - Try to concentrate-- | - Yes. on the intimate contact | between you and the instrument, as a single unit. - Understand? | - Okay. Okay, I'm listening. And-- Let the music take you. Very good. Getting there. Wow, she's good. Ya, she is. You know, Mr. Shawn called me | a filmmaker. What do you think? I don't know. Well, then, maybe you are one. Yeah. Maybe one day | my pictures will hang on his wall, next to | those other great people. Yeah, maybe one day. Maybe. Thank you, Johanna. Does she know it's ready? I called her twice. | She won't open the door. She's getting her | revenge on me. Place is a fucking | squatter camp. I suppose you know | about all this? We all have our little secrets. Like father, like daughter. Where the hell is she? Hi, dad. Where you been? To my music lesson. Oh, so you went | to your music lesson? Yes. I suppose your mother | took you, huh? No, she was resting. So I took my bike. You took your bike. Listen, what's all that crap | on your walls? It's just stuff, Dad. And those books? Now, c'mon, where | do you get those books from? Who gave them to you? I took all my horse books | to book exchange. I felt I was growing | out of them. Dinner smells nice. I'm going to wash up. Ma? What? Did my father | come home last night? Louise, stop asking | silly questions. Wake up and do | your work, okay? - Morning, Madiba. | - Hello. - Madiba? | - Ma? Come here, sweetie. Is your guitar working? Okay. Come on, kids. Come on. | Time's up. Quick, quick, you're late | for your lessons. Oh, Madiba, my filmmaker. Come in, come in. | Sit down. I've seen your tapes. Very good work. - Here's my tape. | - Oh, another one. Good. I know | a good editor for you. - Will you stop, okay? | - Will you stop, okay? Are you sure | this is the right place? Yeah. How do you know? I know. Where is she? Do you see her? I've got her. - Are you serious? | - There she is. Are you serious? He wasn't joking. Tshu, boys. Hello, Sipho! - Hello. | - How is it, man? Hey, man. How are you? Where have you been, bro? I've been all over, | everywhere. I want to introduce you | to my friends. Boys! This is my boy, Madiba and this is Louise and this is Benny my boy.

Baby, I want you | to take this money. Go buy yourself | some nice clothes. Thank you, Sipho. Hey, girl. But when are you | coming home? See, me and these guys-- we've got a nice home here. That's for you, Bennie. Show Boy-- | That's for you. It's for you, man. How did you find me? I was looking for Estelle. Look, you can | see her all you want. But she's mine now. Watch. - Hey. | - Hello, how are you? I'm cool. - Come sit down. | - Yeah. Do you know where Madiba is? I was supposed | to meet him here.

Sarah, you said | you'd meet him. I'm going home. - Why? | - Because. You know what? | Fine, go home. Come here! Fine, I'll come to you. Sipho says you see him | now and again. I like Sipho. He's cool. Why do you steal books? Doesn't your father | give you any money? It's not about the money. Can I have a look? Oh, come on, please! If you stop seeing Sipho, then maybe I'll show you. Why did you pierce your nose? 'Cause I like it. And it drives my parents crazy. Why? They're too squared. They just never grew up. Grow up? | Your parents? Do you like my nose ring? It's township. All the snazzy girls | are doing it. But you don't like it? No... I like it. I like it a lot. It's open. Listen. Doug phoned me today. He said Sarah | told him that-- She saw you hanging around | with some black kids. I see them | on the beach, Dad. She said you were | kissing one! I kissed him on the cheek. | That's all! Don't mix with black kids. Why not? Just don't. Listen to me, | you stay away from them! Okay? Okay, dad. | Whatever. And get rid of that thing | in your nose. How can I help you? - Hold those still. | - Yeah? - Put it right in front of the lens. | - Okay. Turn it-- There. There it is, yeah. - Like this? | - Yeah. - Are you sure? | - Positive. When I move the camera, you move with it, right? Okay. This is good, man. Can I try like this? Yeah, yeah. | Just keep it there. I said I heard the clap of the gun And then I saw this woman fall My mother's scary soul | was gone I felt him rise above the light And saw him soar | into the night And then I knew | God, I knew I found a new kind of love Do it! Do it! What's up? Come, let's go chill together. Where's Madiba | and the others? Township, I guess. | Come on, let's go. But don't worry, | he'll be here. I know Madiba, | he's my friend.

What is he doing | with a gun? He worries me. Is he a friend of yours? It's none of my business, but if you want some advice, leave the boy alone. He don't go anywhere, | unlike you. Get out of his life. - He's not good for you. | - No! He's my friend. Estelle, you're not | concentrating! Let's start again, please. No, no, no! Bach! Bach! | More Bach! Be careful.

He won't get out of the ghetto. How do I get to his place? It's not for you, man. | Forget it. Don't talk rubbish. Look, I'm on the ground with both of my feet, okay? I need to see Madiba. It's important. Please. He doesn't want | to see you. He told me. He made a mistake. What do you mean, | "he made a mistake"? The kind you don't | have to do, okay? Come on. Be nice.

I may be ugly | but I am not cruel. What's your name? Estelle. I'm Professor Shakespeare. How do you do? Do you know | where Madiba lives? With the wooden camera? Over there. Nunu, I want | to tell you something. Your father is a good man. He cares for you, | he loves you. You see, Nunu, your father, in this house, he is our father. He cares for us, he brings us food, Nunu. As for that black boy, Nunu-- stay far away from him. He's not good. I know these street kids, man. They are not educated. They don't go to school. They are just loafers. You study your books, you study your music and keep away from them. You will exist. Yeah, now, there you are. That's my girl. You can go and wash. I'm going to make | your favorite soup. Okay? Okay, sweetie. | Love you. Okay. Whitey, whitey, whitey. My son is in love with a white girl. Son, you've arrived. Son, you are one up on me | on that one. Viva, Madiba. Viva! Bebuya Africa. Listen, my boy. Listen properly to me. You are hurting me. You are opening my wounds. Listen. When I was your age, I was denied the opportunities that you have now. Can you hear me, boy? Madiba, my son. I was denied the key at your age. I am no piece of shit, boy! I was not | given the chance. For whatever reason, | they denied me! Mr. Filmmaker. It's a hot day. I imagine you have walked | quite a distance. I have some | ice-cold lemonade I was hoping I could | share with someone. Don't you think? - Your lemonade. | - Thank you. I want to show you something. You see the world from a very unique perspective, young man. You think so? I think | it's totally beautiful. Tell me, do your parents | know about you? I'd like to meet them. You've met my father, at the cultural festival. You danced with him. Ah, yes. Her father got | his daughter back. She was now | a princess in a castle, waiting for | her Prince Charming to arrive on a white horse. I've never heard | you play Bach before. You've never heard | me play before, dad. Touch. Listen, I'm... sorry about the other night. I went off. It's just-- You've grown up so quickly. Jumping! Got a minute? Okay, 30 seconds, then. Look, man, | about the other night-- I fucked up badly. It was an accident, man. I was drunk. We've been brothers | for far too long now. Gotta get back on track. Peace? You wanna get back on track? Sure. Start by throwing | that gun away, man. But you won't do it, 'cause you're a gangster now. No, man, I'm not a gangster. Then what are you? What? | A gangster-killer? Sipho, how do I know | you won't kill me? I mean, how can I kill you? You're my brother, | Madiba, man. We're blood-brothers. I've lost you, man. I've lost you. Why are you killing me now? You're killing yourself, man. Sniffing glue | and smoking zor. Killing and robbing people. Okay, what do | you want me to do? Get rid of the gun. Come back to the township. It's where you belong. Your home is here, man. Here's some tapes I bought. | Brand new. No, I don't want stolen shit. You "don't want stolen shit." So you think | you're perfect now-- carrying this little thing | of yours around? You think you're | better than me. You think you can tell me this | and tell me that. Now you can preach | all your morals to me. You don't take | stolen goods-- fine. Fine. But let me | ask you one thing-- where did you get | that camera? Did you buy it? Did you buy it? Think about it. I love you, man. You're my brother. - Morning. | - Good morning. Morning, dear lady. Bonjour, Mr. Shawn. Put your cello over there. What about my lessons? I think we leave the cello | in its box today. I have... a different type of music I want to play for you today. When last did you see him? He comes almost every day now. Does he ask about me? No, but I can tell | by the way he filmed you that the young boy | loves you very much. Can I... take the tapes with me? I think it was made for you. Hi, Estelle. What's up? Hi. Look... I came to say I'm sorry-- apologize. It's for you. Peace? Yeah. You changed your hair. | Why? Here's my dad. | You better go. Go. Go! What's going on here? Who is this? I thought we'd | spoken about this? Listen, go inside. | Get inside. You, please, | stay away from my daughter. - Dad, please stop it. | - Go inside. What you gonna do? | Huh? What you gonna do? You wanna mess with me? Is that what you wanna do? Hey, did you get nice pictures? No, I ran out of batteries. Hey, I was watching that. Just a minute. Shortly before mid-day today, a 1 5-year-old boy | was involved in a shoot-out with security police | while attempting to rob a cash-in-transit vehicle in the Belma Shopping Mall in Longstreet, Cape Town. The following shocking visuals were captured | by security cameras. It's Sipho! According to authorities the teenager's gun | was unloaded. - He now lies critically wounded | - Oh, my God. in the city hospital | guarded by police. I'm Jane Miller | for W4B- TV, Cape Town. Hey, what's going on here? Hey, dad. Where's mom? Who the hell is this? This is Madiba, dad. | He's my friend. He's a really great filmmaker. I've got some of his videos. I'm gonna show you. I suppose he's got | a gun too, eh? Out! Get out of my house! Dad, what are you | talking about? I'm going to call the police. Just get out of my house! Don't move! Dad, don't make me | choose between you and Madiba. "Choose"? Don't talk to me about "choose"! | I'm your father! - I said, get out! | - I'm warning you-- If he goes, I go! Estelle, listen to me. I said, listen to me! Look at your hair. Here-- come, come. Look! Look! | Look at your hair! Do you want your children to have crissy hair | like that little bugger? Do you want them | to run around with people calling them "darky" | or their friends or neighbors? Is that what you want? What are you talking about? Why can't you understand? Why don't you explain it to her? Explain it to her. Why do you think | you've never met your father's parents-- | your grandparents? Go on. Tell her. Stop it. Ask your father why you | never met your grandmother. - The most beautiful woman I ever met. | - That's enough! I'll tell you why. It's because she's colored. It never bothered me, | but for your father-- It's been hell. It was for all of us. Trying to hide it, | trying to be... whiter than white. God. You told me that you fought a lot. You told me | that there was bad blood. This is crazy. Let's get out of here. Sure. You drive. Come, quickly. Quick, quick, quick, quick! Let's, go, let's go! | Let's go! There-- that's Sipho's. - Come, let's go. | - Wow. Come. Wow. - I'll be back. | - Where are you going? - To get my camera. | - Oh, okay. What happened? She was trying to stop your father | from taking your camera. 1 00 rand. I've got 25 rands only. - I'll take it. | - Sharp, sharp. Don't! - You start. | - Okay. Mom, dad, I love you both, but I can't live with you. And, Dad, this has nothing to do with... all that stuff. Well, you know what I mean. Hell, I can't believe that was such | a big deal anyway. So... I guess this is goodbye. Your turn. Father, I want you to know that I'll be somebody one day. And mother, you're a great woman. And take care of Louise. I'll come back for the both of you | when the time is right. Louise, when I make | my first movie, you will star in it. Shine bright and goodbye. - Don't wanna. | - Come on, man. One drink. Brothers forever. Brothers forever. Film that way. Always face backwards | if you want to see the past go by. They didn't know | where they were going to. I hoped things could have | worked out for them here. They are two, beautiful, | talented people. I've kept the wooden | camera box. Dad didn 't try | to sell this one, at least. Sometimes I open it and I see all these images | dancing inside it-- Sipho, Madiba, Estelle, Benny and me, Louise.
