Give me 2 days. I don't think God will toy with us. Lee Ta En! Open the door! Are we friends? Will this work? I don't know. Why don't you call the ambulance? Don't fucking kill him! We need him alive! Yes, sir! Shit! China Town, Thailand. Brother Wah. L got it. The call is from a prison in Bangkok. Our guy may be inside. Please be careful. Hello? What is it? I followed you here from the prison. What do you want? I want to see someone. Sa? No answer! Daddy, I'm scared. Sa, look at this small plant before it starts to germinate, it's only a seed buried in the soil in complete darkness. It doesn't know what it's future will be like. Just like you and me. We're both scared. That's why we must have hope. Just like the seed in the dark soil. As long as it doesn't give up, germinate and grow, it will see sunlight someday. The world is full of miracles. We must have hope. Smile! Thank you. Sweetie? Is the baby cying again?/ Yes. Where have you been? Mom and Dad are waiting for you. Can you manage? When will you be home? Why two of you? We have a lot to unload. Open the door. Someone wants to see you. Sir, we traced them to Dr. Lee Tai Yun 148 Reclamation Street in Yau Ma Tei. What are you doing? Do you know? You'll get us killed!

Tell me! You're working very hard. Making a delivey at this hour? I let you in because we're like brothers. How could you do this to me? Sorry, boss / Good! If i'm still your boss, I'm giving you a chance to take care of him. But I won't force you. This girl had a blood check. I can save your daughter. RESULTS: 10 out of 10 match. If you won't do it, I'll sell this to someone else. She's your last hope. I'll do it. No...! A dead man is worthless. You're here! Thanks to you! Or I won't be here so fast. Don't mention it, Mr. Hung. If you hadn't saved me back then, I won't be here today. Nice tie! Thank you. Did you hear that? He thanked me. Cops are not the only ones who can be selfless. / You want to kill your own brother. You're worse than a dog. How many lives have I saved? Do you have any idea? He's alive... because of me. Or else... he's dead! I take one life, to save my own. What's wrong with that? In fact... he is my brother. What's between us, is none of your business. My life has been tough, but l still came this far. Look at you. No disease no pain, but you don't appreciate it and end up bleeding all over the place. Look at you... So pathetic! You sound more and more like a mad dog. Except for me, eveyone is afraid to die. Tell you what... I'm sending you on your way. What a mess! Consider this a gift. Go ahead and sell them. Thank you. Surgery has been scheduled. We can start when your brother gets here. Call me when you're ready. Make it quick. Hello, I came to pick up the phone. Did you bring money? / Yes. Thank you. It's working. You're all set. Okay, Thank you. Your phone kept ringing. Look at that! Sa, where are you going? / I want to be alone, it's a secret. Hello? Did you call me? I have a lot of missed calls. Excellent! I finally got ahold of you! What are you saying? What is going on? Money? Sa, this is your godfather. Your Daddy is working. Let him finish working, OK? I'll tell him to call you later. We're leaving. Thank you. I told you, not to wear that when you eat. Relax! Let's eat. Let's break out of here! Uncle! Take them away! / Right! Come on! There's a car! They're not here. It'll work. Go ...! Let's go! Chai! What a moron! What happened to you guys? Give us a hand! Quick! Call Hong Kong. We're going back tonight. Oh my God! What? / The girl has leukemia! Only the owner of the phone can save her. It'd be great if he would go to Thailand. You can understand it? You bet! What is that? Who sent it? / He's not the owner of the phone. I found this picture in the phone. Maybe he's the owner. He's sending me a picture of the owner. / What? Where can I make a long distance call? Excuse me! These belong to your friends, please keep them! / Thanks. Daddy, where are you? I got through to his phone, he sent me a picture. I'm sending it to you now. Nurse! Where are you? Sa, Come here. I found him, The man who can save me. I have his picture, that's him! That's him! That's him! Why do you have my photo? We have assured you that your bone marrow can save Sa. But at this time, we are unable to accept your donation. Why? By law, any drug user must quit for a minimum period of three years before giving any donation. However, I don't think her condition could withstand for another six months. I'm Sorry. I have done something bad in the past. I can't help you iust yet. What if I wait for you? I promise i'll live till the day you can save me I'm sure you can. Thank you! Thank you! Hit him hard! You have a last wish? I... want you to die. I can't help you with that. Start the surgery. I can't believe the guy who can save Sa is your nephew. If you believe, you can keep on going. God will not toy with us. One day, when you look back, you'll know... The wrong thing, happens at the right time. Lotus Medical Center, Thailand. Call the doctor! I gave you the money you needed. You needed someone to save your daughter, I found one for you. You think you've done a good thing? Hopefully you won't get it evey day. You killed your own daughter. Chop him up and feed him to the dogs. / Yes, sir! Hold this! Hurry! Mr. Hung? You're not in surgery? Get over here! What happened? Bring the guy and get over here! You should have the address! Catch him! Quick! Stop! Good evening. Sa? Where's Sa? Find him! Open it! Open it! Open it! I told you to come here and open it! Stupid! Open it slowly. What're you looking at? Mask! Can you promise me something? Give this to Daddy! Let the Boss go, I'll let your friend go. Turn on the lights and lock the elevator. I'm the guy from Hong Kong you've been looking for. Sa! Daddy, he sent me a picture. I'm sending it to you now. It's me! I won't make it. Without a doctor, your heart is useless to me. If you were not my brother, I would have done this over 10 years ago. I had no choice. But you do. Go! Hurry! Don't go. If you leave, I'll die! Are you alright? I can't see a thing! Sa! Where will i go? Don't be afraid!, You will be fine. You can't die, you still have to save my daughter. I heard they looked for me for a long time. Luckily they found me in the end. A lot of things in life are beyond our control. Just like the ice on the lake. No one knows when the ice will crack. I never told anyone what happened that night. Because no one would believe there's a wolf in Bangkok. I'll never forget the way the wolf looked at me. Daddy taught me to deal with fear and have hope.
