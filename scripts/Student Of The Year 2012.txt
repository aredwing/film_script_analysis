The last day of the Student Of The year competition. Like in all competitions there was one winner. But all of us lost something that day. But the biggest loss that day was Dean Yogendra Vasisht's... Who started this competition 25 years ago. That was Dean Yogendra Vasisht's last year at St. Teresa's... After that day he left and made a separate world for himself far from everyone. And except for our Coach Shah no one else had access to this world. But I could never forget him. I always wondered where he was... How he was... One question kept bothering me all the time... Did all of this happen because of me? And ten years later I got a chance to find the answer. How are you? Of course I remember... Tell me... Dean? Tell everyone? Ok, Ok... I will tell everyone... What's that... Facebook... Yes... I will reach tomorrow... Haven't spoken to anyone in ten years... I will call all of them but... So much has happened... I don't think all will come... I was wrong... All of them are coming... Because like me, all of them have been searching for the answers to their questions... Probably this is the last chance for all of us... To learn the truth... I will call as soon as I reach, ok? She still has a bit of a flu... The doctor's number is written there... Don't forget to give medicines... Hey Jeet... How are you? Hey Dimpy... How are you? I'm fine... And you? I'm good... Heard you have become a big coach... Yes... In the Girl's School... And you have become a very big lawyer... Yes... A BIG lawyer... I'll be back... Awkward meeting... After ten years... Today they are all saying their hellos and air kissing... Ten years ago, they wanted to kill each other... Coach sir... Four have come... Yes... So are you coming? Ok sir... He was broken after the prize distribution of your batch... He felt responsible for every broken relationship of every batch... Yours was the last batch so he remembered you very often... Especially Rohan and Abhi... He felt as proud of their every achievement as he felt regret for what happened with them... He kept withering with that regret and... I never thought I would ever see Dean Vasisht in this state... I can't believe this is the same sparkling face that welcomed us every morning with a 'Hello, boys and girls'... Those were the days... I wish those days could come back... I would change so many things... That one said... One did... I wanted to be the school's head cheerleader... I did... Yes... Just one thing... I wish things had happened between Rohan and me... Rohan... I was his biggest hanger-on... Which I mistook for friendship... But there's only one friend Rohan has... Had... Rohan Nanda... Younger son of Delhi's business tycoon, Ashok Nanda... He had taken admission in St. Teresa's but was doing a degree in wasting time... He wanted to be the world's biggest rockstar! "My father says I will make him proud." "My son would do such a thing." "But no one knows.." "Who gives up for papa?" "1, 2, 3, 4!" One thing was sure... The only property he would inherit from his father was going to be the guitar! I hated Rohan... He wasn't a big fan of yours either... I don't know what my best friend was doing with him for so many years. Shanaya Singhania... The only daughter of her mother and her step-dad's fifth... The most beautiful girl in St. T's... "The girl has got everything." "The girl's got, girl's got, girl's got." "I've got it all." "Jimmy Choo and Manolo." "Prada, Galliano.." "Can't get enough, I want more and more." "Louis Vuitton and the Stella McCartney." "Donatella Versace." "The newest line from Gucci." "Looking at my intoxicating eyes.." "..everyone has gone crazy." "Guys, control yourself.." "..or it will become difficult for you to live." "The girl has got everything." "The girl's got, girl's got, girl's got." "No one is like me." "Everyone dreams about me. I'm the number one." "The world follows me." "I'm ahead of everyone. I'm number one." "I've got it all. Jimmy Choo and Manolo." "Prada, Galliano." "Can't get enough, I want more and more." "Louis Vuitton.. ..and the Stella McCartney." "Donatella Versace." "The newest line from Gucci." "Looking at my intoxicating eyes.." "..everyone has gone crazy." "Guys, control yourself.." "..or it will become difficult for you to live." Unfortunately no designer label was selling love... Or Shanaya would have bought the whole counter... "The girl has got." Where were you? Jail... Why? Talk to your sister properly... She is not my sister, Mom... She is your husband's daughter... Did you see my boyfriend? You do know that wine stains are permanent? Thank you for the washing machine tip! You need it... What are you doing? Rohan if you don't change your antics this term... I will leave you... You look sexy when you threaten... Like its name it was fully British... Built 100 years ago by the Britishers and run by the Deans post-independence... The top professionals of every field in the world had students from St. T's... It wasn't a normal school... It was a world in itself... And the most unique specimen of that world, Dean Yogendra Vasisht... The most dynamic Dean of St. T's... Looked like a cute Yogi bear but was very scary... The only one who could scare him was his mother... It was a hi-fi school - St. Teresa's... Under the rule of Dean Vasisht, it was divided into two sides... Tata Students and Bata Students... Tata students would feed bank notes to get admission while Bata students had to memorize study notes to gain entry... And then entered Abhimanyu... Who shook the Tata stocks and elevated the Bata prices... "No one knows where you've come to" "Everyone's heartbeats have increased." "No one knows where you've come to" "Everyone's heartbeats have increased." "You are handsome and cool. You are really wonderful." "Seeing him the girls say. - My God." "My God." "This guy is the best. He is better than the rest." "Seeing him the guys say, my God." "He has got six packs. He is 6 feet tall." "He is doing wonders slowly." "He is a handsome guy." "He is a unique and a perfect guy." "He is a handsome guy." "All the girls will fall for his moves." "He is a handsome guy." "Where is he.. - From?" "Who is that.. - Guy?" "He is something very special." "I don't know what I want." "He has really got me going. He makes me feel alright." "Baby, baby get lucky tonight." "I like the way he is looking. The way he is moving now." "I like the way they call him. - He is a handsome guy." "I like the way he is walking. The way he is talking now." I like the way they call him. - He is a handsome guy." "Everyone is running fever because of you." "Unnecessarily everyone is following him." "Take two days life on credit." "You'll stay here only for four days." "No matter how much you plead us, we won't listen to you." "We are Gabbar and you are the inspector." "He is a handsome guy." "All the girls will fall for his moves." "He is a handsome guy." "He is a unique and a perfect guy." "He is a handsome guy." Hey you Hero... Move your Honda... Or then get an LIC policy... Don't you know this is Rohan Nanda's parking? - So? It's Rohan Nanda... Ashok Nanda is his father... He is his son... So why are you overacting? Aren't you your father's son? Shut up you TV serial... Look there... the film has arrived! Why you... Dimpy? Do you get less money for keeping a watch? Move this tincan from here... Not you Pseudo... I was talking of this junk... It's called a bike... Really? What did you say your name was? I didn't say... You quiz show... Are you going to give four options now? Say your name... Abhimanyu... Abhimanyu... Listen carefully... This is my parking... So it's better that you take this tractor's brother back to the fields... Because my car has a standard and this... You are right... Your car is top class... Are you related to Google? Were you a mechanic in your village? No... Valet in a club! Let me do you a favour... Take this and park my car... And take this... 500 Rupees... get your bike cleaned... And listen... Keep the change... Where do they come from? Village bums... Dimpy, next time be careful. You don't study Pseudo... "He is a handsome guy." Take this 500... Get your car cleaned... And listen... Keep the change... What do you think of yourself? Dhishum... Dhishum... Boys love to fight, right? It gives them a chance to prove their machismo... Cheap brawls, fisticuffs and trashing each other is all against the rules of St. Teresas... In this campus if there is any violence allowed, it's by me! So now will you take the trouble of telling me who started this World War 3? He took my parking... Does your father own the parking? Actually yes... Half the school runs with my Dad's trust fund... So you must be paying my salary as well? Not like that sir... Exactly... It's not like that, Rohan Nanda... You love running fast, right? You will find yourself running just as fast out of this campus if you repeat this cheap hooliganism again... Get it? Your father, the rich and royal Ashok Nanda is visiting... Am I very pretty? So why are you staring? Leave! Was our Dean 'that type'? - Which type? That one... Which takes not the highway but the back route... He was a Dean... Not a taxi... Come on... He used to make eyes at the Coach all the time... Make eyes? Sir, Mr Nanda has arrived. Hey... hey... Wow... Your name sounds like the canteen menu... Listen... All us scholar students give you a grand salute... You shook up the ABCs as soon as you came... ABCs? Yes... Affluent Brats and their Companions... Look how they are staring at you! I'm not scared of anyone... Hey... hey... Where are you off? There's a seat empty there... So is your pocket... Just sit with the nerdy gang... Be in your bank limit... Going to open a new account... Want to join? Death wish! New term... New dreams and a new challenge for all of you... Which I started 25 years ago... There's only one out of you who will win the trophy... The only one who's higher studies will be at an International Ivy League college and will be sponsored by St. Teresa's trust fund... Your Dad looks dashing... I can do two things right now... One, I can share some bookish knowledge with you... Or then I can mirror real life for you guys... Because no one has made money till date by either reading or teaching text books... If that was possible your teaching faculty would be here and I would be there... In their place... Teachers teach rules... But winners make them... And the whole school talks about your football skills... Don't you want to play for the team? So why didn't you ask? Borrowed things have to be returned, Sir... I want to earn it... It's football... Not lottery... Let's see if your dribbling skills are as sharp as your tongue... "Kick it." "Yeah." "Kick it." This Abhimanyu must be shown his place... Why? Hasn't he settled in his room? He was being hero on the field today... But boss... He does play the game very well... That even you do... Nothing great with that... Some games have to be played off the field... You go and somehow get the keys for the notice board... Used to play with the boys in the village... Really? That's why you play rough... Don't know about rough... I play solid... Sometimes you tend to lose form when you focus on style... Listen you village Beckham... Arrogance must have its boundaries... That place, in this college, is mine... Why? Are you the PM's son? Think of it like that... Don't worry... I will vote for your Pappa! So much anger... Such attitude... It's not good for your health! Now you are being a mother? No... Father... Yours... After the medical... It's written on the notice board... In English... Read it... Dimpy... Just give this... This to Coach Shah... What's in it? This has... that... My... Your? That thing... On the notice board... My... Why are you being a coy bride? Just give it... I'm going to Coach's house... Will give it... This time free... Next time charge... God... I'm late... He'll be asleep... Dimpy listen... Just leave this... Listen... Munni is notorious but not young while Sheila is young but not notorious... Why Dimpy? Why? How do I know? I'm a boy... Not FM radio... Just take this... Watch some TV... Silly rich kids and their tails... If I ring the bell he will be angry... Will leave it here... "Hail Lord Om Jai Jagdish." "You ease the problems of your devotees.." Respected Coach sir... Thank you from the bottom of my heart for selecting me in the football team... I'm sending you some holy water... That's nice Hope it purifies your home and your family just as it has, mine... Your own Abhimanyu Singh... He is a sweet boy! He has sent holy water... Holy water? Let me sprinkle it through the house... Silly... My home is you... And how can we forget the light of our lives... My son... Live long... Here... Holy water... Keep it safe... What happened? Su su... Is this your prank or did someone else have a hand? Must have done it himself... Why does he need someone else's hand? Say... Sir, I did it... If you stop... Start all over again... You... You... Listen DK Bose... Stop running and listen... Say... I have a dance booking with Pseudo... Just give me 100 bucks and I'll say you finished your rounds... You give me 100 bucks and I will say you watched me run... You will grow up to be a politician... Did I ask for the bribe? Now go... No matter how much Rohan acted as a toughie... He was a softie at heart... Hey... Hey... Hello... I'm talking to you... Abhimanyu... Thanks for yesterday... But you didn't have to save us... I know... I didn't have to at all... Then why did you do it? I was trying to act great... Wanted to know how great people feel... You do know a few of yours are loose... Mine are a few loose... You don't have them... You have heard my Dad... It would rub off wouldn't it? Your Dad is not insane... He's just a little crooked! And he should be... To reach that position you need to be crooked... Wow... Gandhi in your hands and such lofty thoughts... He should be in your pocket... Not in your hands... God made a mistake... You should have been my father's son... Why do you care so much about your Dad? I don't... I don't care about anyone... You do... You want to earn his respect but he doesn't even want to loan it to you... Wow... Now you are an expert in the parents' philosophy too? Yes I have... After they left... Left? On a holiday? Why are you giving a shot? Yours are alive... Come on... You do know you are a big.... Yes I know... Come... Come with me to the canteen... It's time... Time for what? - Shanaya... This year the head cheerleader for the football team is... Tanya Israni... You must be feeling terrible... Because this position is normally given to the most popular girl in the school? To hold pom poms in hands and scream for the boys is not my style... They scream for me... Whistle... That's more my thing! "Shanaya." "Bright like moon with golden tresses." "Here we go." "These blue eyes have some secret in it." "Shanaya." "Bright like moon with golden tresses." "These blue eyes have some secret in it." "How do I praise the one who made you?" "Shanaya." "How do I praise the one who made you?" "Shanaya." "Shanaya. - I want to be like Shanaya." "Shanaya." "How do I praise the one who made you?" "Shanaya." So much love... So much attention... Are you ill? Or have you recovered? I have improved... Or you just want to show the whole world that you are still Shanaya Singhania's boyfriend? You would have made such a good boy... God fell asleep and you were born a girl... I think you are asleep... That's why you can't see your competition... So you are the new boy in the school... As if you didn't notice before... Just saw... Noticing is too far off! Jeet... Chair! No, I'm comfortable boss. Not for you... For Shanaya... Yeah. - No, it's okay. We have class. Whatever your plan is, I'm just happy that I have worthy rival in school! Friction, jealousy, love, friendship... This was all a daily routine with St. T's... But every second weekend all of us got a reality check... When we went back home... Into our real world... Do you think we'll have mid-term polls? There are chances... Our stocks have just stabilized... If there are midterm polls... When did you develop this new hobby? It's our job to think in this house... You just strum the guitar... It was a joke... You are important too in this family.. After all, you will decide who will play the band in my wedding, right? Enough.. Stop! No more... I think it will be a year or even two before we stabilize... Ashok Nanda has influence till Delhi... You don't give up on your friendship with Rohan... He got you into the school... He will be of use in the future too... What's that supposed to mean? Even I have my own personality... Shut up you idiot! A man is either a spoon or a fork! And you are exactly like your father... A spoon... You don't have it in you to be a fork! Shut up! I believe the stocks of your husband's company have fallen... So what if the stocks have fallen... The rocks are still solid... I'm pregnant... Shanaya's father is back in the headlines... I hope you are taking good care of her... I'm her friend, not her security guard! Everything's alright in school, Abhi? Yes uncle... I needed some money for the science project... Of course... Mr Ambani... Why don't you withdraw some money from your Swiss bank account and give it to him? Stop it... I will give it tomorrow my son... There's no salt in the food today... Anyway... I guess it's ok... Is Shanaya still Rohan's girlfriend? I got you some push up bras from London... Are you wearing them? I will win Student of the Year trophy... Very good... But who are you? I'm Kaizad... Why are you pressing like a girl? Do it harder... I can't do it harder than this... They say if you press certain points in your body, the pain is less... I think your wife is troubling you at home... She loves me a lot... I'm actually a bit concerned with the captaincy of the football team... Between Rohan and Abhimanyu... By the way Rohan's Dad is a childhood friend of mine... We grew up together... But obviously you aren't suggesting I make Rohan the captain because of that... I don't care who the captain is... We just have to defeat St. Lawrence... They have been winning consistently for 25 years... And that mean Dean from there, Harkisan Sanan... He has been torturing me for years now... "I'm God's devotee." Last year when you arrived I felt you are the one... Who will seek revenge for all the things done to me... You will, won't you? After much thought I have decided that The captain of the St. Teresa's football team is Jeet Khurana... What did I do wrong, Sir? You heard me right? You are the captain this year... And we have to win at any cost this year! Is that why we chose Jeet? I would have made a better captain than you... There can only be one football on the field! And then came the day when a lot of things began... And a lot of things ended... Get ready to lose! We have been winning for 24 years... This year will be the silver jubilee of kicking your ass! Not this year Harkisan Sanan... My boys are fully prepared this year... Your ants from St. T's... What will they do? Coach Shah has trained them... The gossip says that you have been doing a lot of 'coach, coach' these days... "What do I do?" "Something happens to me." Half time... St Lawrence two and we as usual zero... Nil... Wonder why Coach Shah was using such complicated language... he just should have said 'Be Punjabi'... The boys would have got it! "Punjabi." Hope you won't kiss me now... Won't even hug you... We had to win... After all who was the captain? We didn't win because of you... We won because of Rohan and Abhi... Coach was a smart man... He made you the captain so there's no ego tussle between the two of them... What ego? It was Abhi arrogance that came between them... Winning goal was Abhi's but he deliberately let Rohan score it... This was all Abhi's plan... he wanted to take my place with Rohan... Abhi didn't want to be a hanger on, Jeet... he wanted to be Rohan's friend... Small town boys know how to make contacts... Not that big city girls are any less... Even you were Shanaya's body part... Hanging on to her for life! Saw your best friendship! I'm telling you this was all Abhi's plan... Listen we don't know if it was his plan or not... All we know is that the gates of their friendship opened that day... Mom... This is Abhi... Abhimanyu... - Hello, aunt. - Hello, son. Welcome son... Dad's asking for you... For me? Why? Is he ill? Come... Sir... Just do this much for me... And I will send you a big suitcase as a 'Thank you'... Sorry. Hi. - Will you eat something? No... Dad... This is my friend... - Abhimanyu, right? We are celebrating today... Thanks to Rohan we won the match... Thanks to Rohan? Really? I can't believe it... Dad never praises anyone... Especially me... If you want praises then learn to deserve them... Do something big... Win Student Of the year trophy and we will talk... You won't be happy even then, Dad... So what's wrong with that? You tell me Abhimanyu... Don't you want to win Student Of the Year Trophy? It's already mine sir... Just has to reach home... This is what I like... I'm very pleased to meet you... Tell me... What do you want to be in life? You sir... Like you I come from a small town... Like you I bagged admission through scholarship... I want to work in your company so that I can be a bigger business tycoon than you... Look at some who want to change the world with a guitar... I hope some of your spirit rubs off on Rohan... So he can become someone... I don't know what I will be in life.. ..but I sure will be a better Dad than you... Dad! Come Abhi... let's go. "We are free, we all are free." "Come, and you too be free." "We are free, we all are free." "Come, and you too be free." "We are free, we all are free." "Come, and you too be free." "We are free, we all are free." "Come, and you too be free." "Motorcycles make the sound of 'Dhinchik dhinchik', we have fun." "We will make a puff of the spare time to pass our time." "We are making mischief, uncle-aunties say so." "We have such friendships, we will throw soil on the world." "People say that we are jobless, but how does it matter to us?" "People keep saying this, but how does it matter to us?" "Our shining future is bright enough." "People say that we are jobless, but how does it matter to us?" "People keep saying this, but how does it matter to us?" "Everything is correct when friends are with us." "Our personality is such that everyone will see us attentively." "They will open their big eyes and will appreciate us." "Our friends are in our favour. That's why we wander in attitude." "All our relationships are forever." "Fill bottle and make some pegs and let us make a business." "We will see girls after drinking two patiyala pegs." "People say that we are jobless, but how does it matter to us?" "People keep saying this, but how does it matter to us?" "Our shining future is bright enough." "People say that we are jobless, but how does it matter to us?" "People keep saying this, but how does it matter to us?" "Everything is correct when friends are with us." Do you miss your parents? Yes... Me too... Today's subject is Radha Rani... Radha Rani says... Breasts... Buttocks... You two gentlemen... Stand up! Stand up! "Cannons are being shot in the heart. The heartbeats dive in water." "Girls get what they want when their eyes meet with ours." "Girls kiss and say us that they misses us." "All the women lose their hearts, dedicate their lives." "Girls have problem when we run the car fast." "We say hello and bye by making huge sound of the horn." "People say that we are jobless, but how does it matter to us?" "People keep saying this, but how does it matter to us?" "Our shining future is bright enough." "People say that we are jobless, but how does it matter to us?" "People keep saying this, but how does it matter to us?" "Everything is correct when friends are with us." "We are free, we all are free." "Come, and you too be free." "We are free, we all are free." "Come, and you too be free." "We are free, we all are free." Do you love Shanaya? I'm confused... About Shanaya? About love... Are you gay? Yes... Come on... Come... Why are you asking Simi Garewal type questions? Do you love Shanaya? "Come, and you too be free." "We are free, we all are free." "Come, and you too be free." It was late last night so Rohan asked me to stay over... Come... Sit... Hello Aunty The maestro is practicing... The noise that Rohan Nanda calls music... I was going to take suggestions from Rohan for my wedding music... But now... I've changed my mind. Wedding reminds me... Ajay is getting married in Thailand... Your coach, Dean, Shanaya, Tanya and their parents... Everyone is coming... Rohan didn't mention anything about it... He hasn't been invited yet... On that note. I'm leaving... I'm late... Please come... Sit... It's your house... Gayatri.. I'm coming for your brother's wedding... Mr Nanda just invited me... Congratulations... He might even give you a share in his inheritance... That's what I'm angling for... Don't forget Dad will come with it... For this kind of a bank balance I can take Dad, Granddad and ancestors too... I have been on a diet for two weeks... Even I... Even I... On a diet? Its showing... Tell the Dean sir? No no... I was saying a couple picture... Couple? The light's not good! Where's the baggage? Baggage? But your clothes must have fit in this handbag? We have met... No... That's not my name... I was offering it to you... What's the plan? Nothing... She is pressing your back... Can I press your neck? Since you are so fond of massages... Rohan is very stressed... I am just releasing his tension... So then why don't you open a counter? All the Bangkok boys can come to you... To release their tension... You are just getting out of hand... Why do you need to be so insecure? I'm just chilling with friends? What am I doing wrong? What is wrong? Nothing Rohan... Nothing... Couldn't come himself so has sent his stooge to wipe my tears... I'm no one's stooge... And I haven't come here to wipe your tears... Your nose is running... You are the classy type... Doesn't suit you... Now that I'm here are you going to tell me your tragic story or are just going to waste time? I'm fed up of Rohan... I know him for ten years... I have been his girlfriend for four years... And for the last one year I have just been feeling that all of this is a big mistake... So why don't you leave him? I don't like breaking relationships... Then do something... Get him on the right track... How? By taking the crooked route? "Krishna roams around with Gopis." "He plays with them, can't stop.." "Now I don't like him."

You said to take the crooked route to set things straight... Which other crooked route could be straighter than you? Rohan is my friend... That's why you won't take advantage of me... And my work will get done... You are being a true friend... By saving your friend's relationship... And who knows? We may be friends along the way... You are not as stupid as I thought What's the plan? "Shanaya." Can I sit here? You are so stressed... Can I release your tension? Is it feeling good? Feeling too good... What are you doing? Rohan... Make noises... To hell with noises! I think he has left... You act so well... Come let's go... "The drums are being played and I'm dancing." "I'm dancing inside the shade of umbrella." "The drums are being played and I'm dancing." "I'm dancing inside the shade of umbrella." Why are you giving her these Romeo type looks? I have been watching you for two days... You said Shanaya is not your type? Now she is... Stay away from her... - Why? She's my girlfriend... Really? Since when? Abhi, I'm serious. You? Serious? That's the problem with you... That you are not serious... Where's the time for you to get serious? Meaning? Meaning when did you last hold Shanaya's hand? Hold her? Looked into her eyes and spoke? Who looks into the eyes and speaks? Listen just drop this cool dude attitude of yours... You were jealous seeing me with Shanaya, right? Yes... You died of envy, right? - I did... This was all to get you on the right track... This was all a plan? - Yes. A plan You wont get another girl like Shanaya... Look at how she laughs... Is dramatic... Takes a fashion designer's name after every breath... She is arrogant... has a temper... But she is justified... She feels the lack of love... So needs it badly... She's not too clever but I guess that's why she loves you so much... You are sweet... To explain all this to me you have studied her so well... You are right... I'm just a big... Yes... A very big one... Now if you leave her hand I will hold it... I will kill you... But before that I will give you a hug... You are sure that Shanaya and you don't... No... It's me and you... "The drums are being played and I'm dancing." They say you should hide your boyfriend's name in the henna design... If he finds it then it's relationship of a lifetime... Really? - Really. So should I look for it? Yes... Look for it... "I'm dancing inside the shade of umbrella." "I can't stay without you, o beloved." "My wish has been fulfilled today." Shanaya wasn't in Abhi's plan... He was used to winning but here he had lost... It was all because of Shanaya... She was playing with the emotions of both the boys... Everyone's not like you, Tanya... At that point, Shanaya didn't even know Abhi's feelings... These feelings... It's Abhi's feelings that ruined it all for everyone... Everything went awry! Everything went awry because of the competition... Did the competition ruin everything? Or did we? Hi Rohan... Just a second... I'll get a chair... How are you Jeet? Very good... Come here... You are looking like a girl... Effect of motherhood... Even you have become something in life... Effect of leaving the father... What have the doctors said? - Rohan Nanda? Come... How are you brother? - Fine. How are you? - Fine. I hated Rohan because of Shanaya... And Rohan wasn't a serious boyfriend anyway... I was looking at someone else for Shanaya... And that day, I found a way... Look Shanaya, your boyfriend is here... Look I don't know what happened over the weekend... But I was observing Abhi... It's because of him that Rohan and I have come closer... He was staring at you from afar, Shanaya... And only a one sided lover stares like that... You were staring at him too... I mean observing him... Don't try to be too smart... It doesn't suit you... I just told you what I saw... I just wanted to thank you again... - Yes, it is not a big deal. Everything is alright, right? Like... Between us... No Shanaya... Everything is not alright... Like... Between us... Abhi... I love Rohan... I have heard that Shanaya... Are you telling me or convincing yourself? Look I came to St. T's to make my future... To win the Student Of The year trophy... I got distracted for a while but now I see my goal clearly... No one can get in my way now... Student of the year competition is divided into three sections... First the treasure hunt... then the dance competition and finally the Triathlon... These three segments will test your three As - Academics, Arts and Athletics... After every segment four contestants will be eliminated... But before all of this is the elimination round.. ..which is the IQ test... You are studying for the test? You? Me? "Until or unless your mind does not whistle like a pressure cooker." "Mug up, mug up." "Make the wall of knowledge fell down by throwing your.." "..head again and again.." "Mug up, mug up." "If you get fever, drink coffee to get rid of that." "Make your brain sharp by rubbing it, my friend." "Mug up.." "Forget the Everest, Climb the mountains of books hundreds of times." "Mug up by speaking it aloud." "Make your brain run faster, hit it with lash, hit it." "Mug up by speaking it aloud." "What will you get by frightening, what will you get out of it." "Swallow the tonic of victory, my friend." "Mug up." Everyone is falling all over their textbooks... But I want to only... fall at your feet! Help me Mother! I'll just be back... "This is love." "At the end of the day, the sword of performance is hung above you." "This is such a river." "Remember this, the one to drown will survive." "Whoever comes here, gets a single chance." "Think, every sight here has just a single destination." "If you get a chance, don't lose it, it won't come again and again." "Mug up." Hail God Mother A... Hail God mother B... Gut wrenching day!

Now there's this new system among the Gods too? You drama queen, why are you crying? We are all in the Top 16... How does it matter who wins and who loses? Of course it matters... Our ambitions are big... Your father is... He can get you into any big university... Here we go again... He is after my father... You listen to me... You take my father and in exchange give me your ambitions... If you want my ambitions I will give them to you happily... Your generous nature is known to the whole campus, Tanya... But we are digressing from the topic... We are chatting about the competition and I think there shouldn't be any competition among friends... Right Shruti? Right... is that why you were studying stealthily? If we are all vying for the same place then there is bound Does that mean to win you will prey on your best friend? Yes... Maybe... Next step... The Top 16 will be divided into four teams... Every team will get four different clues one clue after another... But the last winning clue, will be the same for all the teams... The team that reaches the last clue first will win this segment... Team A.. - The combination for Teams A and B was weird... Rohan and Abhi in different teams... Rohan and Shanaya in different teams... Rohan and I were in separate teams too... Shanaya and I were in different teams... I was in Rohan's team... Here are the first clues for the four teams... Blue sky above and Blue sky below To find the answer delve deep, gentlemen... Ancient smile is Ajit's beloved She follows you with a smile this mysterious lady... What kind of a clue is this?

If you chat I hear you too... So beautiful am I that your teacher loves me too... It said tree so we are in the woods but I cant see any teacher here... What are we looking for? Teacher or Tree? We are looking for the clue... If you have a better idea, tell us Shanaya... Yeah Just leave sister-in-law alone... She must be your sister-in-law, not mine... Think... Who is the teacher? The Lord and the teacher! - Shut up. There is no Gurudwara in the campus... I think we should have one... Why don't you suggest it to Yogi? Ok I will... Yogi... He is our teacher...

I don't want to play this game anymore... Who's going to answer in a silent room? Books? Shut up... What's the first voice of Independent India? Long Live motherland! It said voice... Not a slogan! I think it must be Mahatma Gandhi... I think she's right... He went on a diet for our country... Fast... I can't say it any faster than this... Not Mahatma Gandhi... It's Jawaharlal Nehru... India's first speech was by Jawaharlal Nehru... That's the first voice... It's visible now... Just a second... Let me open... Can you see it? - Hang on a second...

But I'm tired of room service at home... Ok come... So then come more often... Even today I had to invite myself over... You do know that your grandson is not normal... Did he fall somewhere when he was young? Just focus on your dal... Abhi... Is that the way you speak to guests? Rohan my son... I can call you that, right? Just wanted to say that your page You are far more charming and handsome in real life... Keep some butter aside for the bread, Geeta... Butter is so expensive, Mom... We have to make do with words in this house... Rohan... We are shareholders in your Dad's company... I'm sorry about that, sir... No, no... We have earned quite well... Abhi... Do get some tips on the stocks and let me know... Even we should benefit from your friendship, right? Don't worry, uncle... I will benefit so much from him that I will leave him far behind... Yes, yes... Why not? Buy the Taj Mahal too... You don't need money to dream, do you? Stupid people like you and me dream, aunty... Abhi is a blue chip investment... ..he will not rest till you are all millionaires... Watch my words! Pass me the pickle! Felt good when you took up for me with my aunt... Felt like someone my own was talking... I never knew Mr Nanda's son had this talent too... A slap and a compliment both together... is that how they say 'Thank you' in your village? Ok... Here it is... Thank you! By the way why do you hide your emotions so much? Are you a girl? What kind of questions are these? Matters of the heart my friend... No one listens at home so I thought I would try it on you... Even I have little practice... The ones who listened left me and grandma has a hearing aid... So both of us are in the same situation... So we can talk to each other... You... won't kiss me now, right? Won't even give you a hug! Abhi! - What happened? Call the ambulance, fast! Grandma is... I don't know... Just call the damn ambulance... Where are you going? - Grandma... We will take care of your grandma... Every house you go... There's only bad luck! Leave me... This is wrong... Are you ok?

Doctors are saying it's serious... If something happens to you I will never speak to you... Never speak with your back to a person... There's something... Urgent... Tell me... After I go... Please put a nice picture of mine in the drawing room... A smiling one... Abhi was broken after Grandma's death... He became quiet... He wasn't saying anything to anyone... Rohan's room is ahead... I came to meet you... To condole me? Rohan was saying you don't want to meet anyone... You can't be alone like this... I have to get used to being alone... Everyone who was close has left... You stay away too... Or you will die! You need a friend... We can't be friends, Shanaya... Do you want to be my friend? What are you doing? Shanaya... Just go... I don't want to meet anyone... Go... I said Go... But Abhi... This won't suit you... "This is love." What are you doing? You shut your mouth... You showed your true class... Came down to your true cheap self... I should never have indulged small people like you... I was your best friend... And what did you do? You are no one's Abhi... No one's... That's why there's no one for you... Everyone's dead... Mom... Dad... Grandma... Everyone! If you say one more word about my Mom or Dad I will break your face... You couldn't belong to your Mom and Dad... What best friend are you of mine? You talk about class... Status... What are you? You just waste your father's money and time... Father's money... Father's money... You were always after my father's success... Isn't that why you became friends with me? You wanted to live my life... That's why you wanted to snatch my girlfriend... Stop this nonsense of girlfriend-boyfriend... Shanaya has never loved you and you? You pounce on every second girl... You have no right to call her your girlfriend... Don't teach me my rights... Shanaya is mine and only mine... Why don't you ask her who she belongs to? Shanaya loves me... What do you two know about me? About my feelings? Nothing... Neither of you wants to know them... You just want to own me... I'm not a part of the competition that you guys will fight and win... What happened, Rohan? - Nothing... Nothing? You are bleeding... And you say nothing? - Nothing. Nothing Ma... Nothing happened... Dad... Nothing happened... Look at yourself... You look like a street ruffian... Who did you fight with? Answer me... I told you I don't want to answer... You have to answer... It's my house... I have had it with your insolence... You don't speak properly at home.. ..but at least keep my prestige intact outside... You haven't earned prestige Dad... Only money... And that's the money that helps you live your life... You only know two things... Waste money and shame me... What are you ashamed of, Dad? Of what? That I'm not like you... Not a Xerox copy like your elder son? That I don't want to be an industrialist and I want to be a musician? Yes... I'm ashamed... Very ashamed that my son has such middle class dreams... Dreams don't have a class Dad... But that only a father would understand... Not a corrupt man! I don't want to live in your house... And I don't want to be your son... You have ceased to be my son... I was never your son... Not today... When you have been silent for so many years... Don't say anything today as well! I thought it was a family fight that would get resolved... But the spoilt rich brat had reformed... And he decided never to look back... I made the mistake of being your good friend... Now I won't lose the chance of being your worst enemy... Student of the year trophy will be mine now... I will snatch your destiny from you... Watch it... And the war took a new shade... Now it wasn't enough to win... It was important to defeat others... Friendships, relationships... all of it was immaterial... We all had our eyes on one goal... Student Of the Year... Aren't you planning to move ahead? Today upper body... Just upper body! "Mug up." Who are you going to the prom with? Abhi or Rohan? The whole school is gossiping about me... Forget the school... Talk about your feelings... I hate both of them... You love Abhimanyu... Rohan and I have been... What about Rohan and you? There's nothing there, Shanaya... Your pair was not destined... It was an arrangement... You are confused and you are allowed. Take some time... Your heart will give you the right answer... This competition in the middle of all this... So then give it up... Is this competition more important than your feelings? No, right? No... I'm not going to be a part of this dance competition... And if that means I will be disqualified... so be it. What do you think? If I was in your place, I would do the same... I was thinking about you... - Why? It's because you are dumb but you have a good heart... That's why I have decided that this year.. ..on the prom night I'm your date... You are not a date... You are late... Shanaya has already asked me... And she is going to enter with me... hand in hand. Not what? Hot... what you are not. You are going to prom with Jeet? Yes... I thought suddenly that why should I let Rohan and Abhi control my life? And why did you think that suddenly, Shanaya? You should be happy... I don't understand this reaction... You wanted me to back out of Student Of the Year... You wanted me to be disqualified.. ..so that the chances of your winning go up... You and dance is like me and poor! If I was in your place, I would do the same! No... I have just fought with Shanaya... I'm fed up... Why? What happened? She says she's confused between Rohan and you... But she's going to prom with Jeet so Rohan is jealous... Then where's the confusion? I don't want to get caught up in between all this... Who are you going to prom with? Jeet no one's going to the prom with me... Help me please... See... I like you a lot. But I can't go to the prom with you... Not you... But set me up with someone... You think I run an agency? Just go... Let me sleep... - Pseudo get up. Just get up... Up... Up... What is it? You will go with Shanaya to the prom? Who the hell do you think you are? - Jeet... Even I know your name, idiot... Have you been bitten by a mad dog? When I was a kid... But what's that got to do with anything? Just go and tell Shanaya you can't go to prom with her... Come on go... I'm not your slave understand? And I don't need your permission to lead my life... You wastrel... You have been living on my credit card for the last two years... What about that? Suddenly you have wings? So I have given full services for the credit card... Jeet, get a drink... Jeet, Park the car... Take Shanaya here... Take Shanaya there... So now I'm taking Shanaya to the prom... Showed me your true class... Just go... What class are you talking about? You have left your Dad now... So the credit card is of no use to anyone... Get away! I'm not scared of you... I'm now on my own... Not your bodyguard! I'll show you... By winning Student Of The year trophy! You will win the trophy? I'd like to see that! If you want, I will go to the prom with you... No one wanted to go to the prom with me... And finally my hand was held... "There's something about tonight." "Something very special." "Something about the way you move that thing." "Something very special." "Something about the way you look it at me." "Something very special." "There's something about tonight." "Something very special." "Intoxicating." "There's something about tonight. Something very special." "Something about the way you move that thing." "Something very special." "There's something about tonight. Something very special. Here we go." "I'll forget the whole world and dance with you." "Baby, you are so sexy." "Boy, you could be my one and only. I'll dance with you." "Then I see you looking on me.

"Crazy about disco. - You know it, so sing it." "Now throw your hands up and say." "Crazy about disco." "This night is intoxicating. So hold my hand." "Let's sing and dance together." "Crazy about disco." "Play the night game with me for a while." "Come and swing in my arms for a while." "I'll explain you from my eyes." "The night is still left. Make me intoxicated." "Dance like crazy tonight. Move like an fun frolic tonight." "Party like a bee tonight. Say whatever you want." "You got to do the D.I.S.C.O. where everybody knows where we got to go." "You get many excuses." "You know it, so sing it. Now throw your hands up and say." "Crazy about disco." "This night is intoxicating. So hold my hand." "Let's sing and dance together."

"Something about the way you move that thing." "Something very special." "Something about the way you look at me. Something very special." "There's something about tonight. Something very special." After the dance competition four students out of the twelve have been eliminated... Now these eight finalists will fight in the triathlon to win the Student Of The Year... Good morning. - Hi Abhi, how are you? Abhi and Rohan both are in the top eight... The competition is tough... it is not so easy. You will say that... Rohan is your son after all... That's why I say the victory is Abhi's... "Mug up and become 100% ready." "Don't leave any table unturned. - Win the game." "There's only one solution. - For your problem." "Push it hard." Shruti! - "Push it hard." "Push it hard." We are on the last leg of the Student Of The year - the Triathlon... This is a unique combination of swimming, cycling and running... The last eight finalists will participate in it... Every student of St. Teresa's dreams of winning the Student Of the Year trophy... There have been many exemplary students who have won this in twenty five years... I don't mean to insult anyone but I can't accept this trophy... I have my own reasons... When you should clap why aren't you guys clapping? This kind of unruly behaviour wont be tolerated in this school... Get him out of here... This Student Of the year is your idea, right? Then you should get the award... For the most stupid idea... Why? Because you didn't win? Just look at yourself... Yes... I lost... But why did I lose? Because of you... Because of your dumb rules... Make the girls and boys race together... Get a partner to the prom... Dance and win a trophy... Who cares, this Pappu can't dance? Just let me speak... This charade has been on for twenty five years... And why? Because Dean Yogendra Vasisht has no entertainment in his life.. He is alone and so he wants to break our friendship... Your final episode is a hit! The friendships that were built over two years have been finished in two weeks! We hate each other! I thought you would call me when you had a baby... So much ego? Not ego... Shame... What was the use of all that? Forget all that and show me the baby's picture... What's her name? I can't even afford the name... You haven't changed... How's Tanya doing? She's hunting for a new husband... Keep Abhi away from her... I have to keep Abhi away from someone else... It's a hospital... Can't have them trashing it... I'll just come... You didn't even invite me for the wedding... I would have come... From the bride's side... It was my right... Why this intense look? There must always be pain on a musician's face... Or else CDs don't sell... I have heard your songs... Does Abhi allow you to listen to them? I listen to them stealthily... You married him and still exercising your right on me? It's been ten years... Can't you just say a hello? He sings loudly on stage... Even he can say hello! You are an investment banker... Not a nine year old... And you are my wife... Not your ex-boyfriend's lawyer... I saw you hugging him... Feeling a lot of love? What else did you expect? His bank account may have crores.. ..but class is still unaffordable for him... What did you do with all your class? You just strum strings on stage... But I hug very well... Just hold your tongue... She is my wife... When you kissed her she was my girlfriend... Stop them... One minute... It's the pent up feeling of ten years... Let it flow... Why such rage? Why so much anger? Can't be because of Shanaya... You never even loved her... Then why this anger? Why? You lost on purpose that day... On purpose... The question has been eating my insides for ten years... Why did you do it? Tell me why? Because your father was a bastard... He looked happy when he saw you losing... I wanted to be like him but I'm not that bad... In that moment I realized I could defeat India's biggest men by making you win... So I did it... My Dad had died Rohan... But even yours wasn't alive... I destroyed my father when I left home... I didn't need your greatness... Greatness? And what about your greatness on stage? Gave a speech like a martyr and walked away... If you knew all this, why didn't you say it that day? Because you wanted your father to feel you won... Who did you call a loser? My last five albums have been platinum hits... So? My company's turnover is 500 crores... So? Top international music labels run after me... Top multinationals beg me for mergers... When I perform the whole of Wembley trembles... When I perform the whole stock market shakes... I have done 100 girls... And I have... Up or down ten... Up or down? Mostly down... You haven't changed... I remember... You won't kiss me, right? Won't even hug you... Look how popular I am... I was a dean for twenty five years and.. ..today six seven students have come to meet me... The fault's mine... I couldn't make my relationships.. ..so got busy breaking others'... Everyone has friends but school and college friends are different... They understand us like our parents do... They know us... Friction, envy, competition... No matter what it goes through.. ..it never clouds the heart! We have a chance after ten years... Now this friendship will not break! Just one business was unfinished... Run... "People say that we are jobless, but how does it matter to us?" "People keep saying this, but how does it matter to us?" "Our shining future is bright enough." "People say that we are jobless, but how does it matter to us?" "People keep saying this, but how does it matter to us?" "Everything is correct when friends are with us." "We are free, we all are free." "Come, and you too be free." "We are free, we all are free." "Come, and you too be free." "We are free, we all are free." "Come, and you too be free." "We are free, we all are free." "Come, and you too be free." "What bothers me?" "People say that we are jobless, but how does it matter to us?" "People keep saying this, but how does it matter to us?" "Our shining future is bright enough." "People say that we are jobless, but how does it matter to us?" "People keep saying this, but how does it matter to us?" "Everything is correct when friends are with us." "There's something about tonight." "Radha on the dance floor." "Something very special." "Radha likes to party." "Something about the way you move that thing." "Radha likes to move." "Something about the way you look it at me." "This is love." "Radha is very beautiful." "He is a handsome guy." "D.I.S.C.O." "Baby, you are so sexy." "Come to me. - Baby, you are so sexy." "Baby, you are so sexy." "We are free, we all are free." "You know it, so sing it." "Come, and you too be free." "You too be free. - You know it, so sing it." "We are free, we all are free." "Now throw your hands up and say." "This is love." "He's a handsome guy." - D.I.S.C.O." "This is love." "Something very special." "I'll forget the whole world.. ..and dance with you." "You are so sexy." "Boy, for me you are one and only.. ..I'll dance with you." "So sweet and so cool. So nice and wonderful." "Seeing him the girls say, my God." "You know it, so sing it. Now throw your hands up and say." "D.I.S.C.O." "Radha, your earring. Radha your moves." "D.I.S.C.O." "Radha, your earring. Radha your moves." "Come, and you too be free." - Something very special." "D.I.S.C.O." "You know it, so sing it." "This is love."
