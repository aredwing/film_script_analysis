Today, dolphins seem like part of the family. They enchant us with their willingness to please and perform. But the dolphin's true home - the sea is an alien world and here a different side emerges. Cunning, powerful and relentless, dolphins are consummate predators. They are social creatures that communicate and cooperate for danger can strike from anywhere. The quest for prey, the quest for mates, nothing comes easy out here. For the ocean is as unforgiving as it is boundless. Join us as we explore the world of dolphins in the wild. In the salt marshes of South Carolina is a rich ocean estuary a nursery for fish and shellfish and a lure for all kinds of predators. Every day as the tide ebbs, the broad mud banks become exposed. It is then an extraordinary event occurs. Seabirds vie for a front row position. They have an intense interest in what is to come. The predators regroup for another coordinated attack. These are bottlenose dolphins among the most inventive and intelligent hunters in the sea. Here they locate schools of small fish in the turbid channels. Then in a stunning maneuver, they rush up the mudflats creating a bow wave that drives the fish ashore. Using their excellent above-water vision, they snatch up the fish stranded on the banks. How dolphins locate the schools of fish and coordinate their attack is not entirely known They may use either audible or visual signals For some reason the dolphins always rush up the banks on their right side Over time the teeth on that side will actually be worn down from chewing as much mud as fish Occasionally they will work themselves completely out of the water Being stranded up here could be fatal As they shimmy up the mud banks it's almost as if they're evolving into the land creatures they once were Some fifty million years ago the ancestors of these air-breathing mammals ventured into the seas To follow dolphins in the wild is to discover one of the most remarkable adaptations in the natural world They use their intelligence to survive changing or inventing strategies to suit their environment Spinner dolphins leap in what appears to a display of exuberance In fact, they may be signaling others to join them, or coordinating movements of the pod... A kind of long distance communication. At close range, dolphins "speak" through clicks and whistles. These signals can mean anything from "Food's over here" to "Watch out! There's danger!" They also communicate through touching. Dolphins are notoriously affectionate and extremely sensuous. When dolphins mate, they swim in rhythm with the female on top. Sex is as frequent as it is casual. It's not always for reproduction Often it's a social tool used to strengthen and maintain bonds Whether old or young male or female - all dolphins engage in caressing and petting But beneath this veneer of harmony lies a darker side... marked by conflict and violence Surprisingly the beloved bottlenose we know as "Flipper" may be the most aggressive dolphin species In the Bahamas two male bottlenose harass a male spotted dolphin At first the interaction seems harmless enough but it quickly escalates The bottlenose take turns assaulting the spotted perhaps to assert their dominance Next they turn on a spotted dolphin half their size It's only a calf Bottlenose are among the very few wild creatures that will kill for reasons other than hunger Swimming in formation a group of adult spotteds rush in to intercede In the flurry of threats the calf escapes to the surface Bottlenose are even more prone to clashing with members of their own species These males in the Bahamas bear many scars including those from fierce battles A first sign of impending trouble is "jaw clapping" a clear audible threat When fights break out they're marked by head ramming biting and blows from powerful flukes Many dolphins have evolved their own sometimes brutal aspects of society Shark Bay in Western Australia where vast sea grass beds support a large community of bottlenose dolphins Here an international team of scientists investigates dolphin aggression The waters of Shark Bay are in the throes of what appears to be a gang fight Groups of males are observed chasing down other males It can go on for hours and cover miles of territory The battles are over females part of an extremely complex social system only now being unraveled by Dr. Richard Connor from the University of Massachusetts He's spent his professional life studying dolphins in the wild And his work has changed our image of the dolphin I think in the 1960's the myth was generated that dolphins were all sweetness and light And almost incapable of aggression At least that was the public perception carried on a large part until today Dolphins are capable of a lot of aggression They can be quite nasty depending on the circumstance They are complex intelligent social mammals and that carries with it a range of behaviors from the nice to the not so nice Just like in our own species And like our own species dolphins are highly individualistic To study their relationships Connor needs to clearly recognize individuals He does this by their unique fin markings He's studied them in Shark Bay since 1982 and he knows over three hundred dolphins by name and Minnie right there between them. And here comes Bad Ghost and Poltergeist. There's Wow resting at the surface. There's Myrtle, there's Hobo. Xxx and Horton? Beautiful, look at that! All together. Connor is especially intrigued by relationships between the males To him, it's like cracking the code of a secret society They follow a mature male with a jagged dorsal fin named "Bottom Hook" He's usually observed swimming with another male called "Pointer" They're almost inseparable forming what Connor calls an alliance Some of these alliances last for a dozen years or more Today a female is seen swimming between them as if she's being herded In fact, she is their captive They guard her night and day Very rarely do you see the female off to the side from the males They like to keep her between them That basically eliminates avenues of escape for her We've seen them keep females for over a month at a time Bottomhook and Pointer are vigilant Their strategy is to keep her from mating with other males To limit the female's choice to themselves We've often seen the males use a lot of aggression to keep the female with them. Even so, it's likely that the female wants to mate with these males as well as other males in the bay The males are trying to sequester the female simply to increase the chance that they will be the father of the offspring Eventually, the hungry males must break formation to feed Pointer races off to chase a fish It's a risky move because in the confusion the female may try to escape One male will be close to the female for a while The other will be off foraging catching fish And then they'll switch. And the one that was off chasing fish will come back and stay close to the female Now here Pointer is rushing back towards her now As Pointer resumes guard duty he warns the female with a popping sound It means: "stay close" For other male alliances are prowling the bay in search of females to capture and they'll kidnap them from rivals But not without help Connor found that different alliances will join forces to kidnap females or to defend against attacks Some of these groups have joined together to form a nearly invincible super-alliance It consists of fourteen males and their captive females Unique in the animal kingdom Connor calls them the "wow crowd" We suspect from what we can see the "wow crowd" seems to dominate interactions in this area Probably by being in such a large group they are able to defeat other alliances But we suspect that the way they're always changing partners is required to maintain friendly bonds within the group They have to take turns cooperating with each other to sort of keep things on a friendly basis between all the alliances Maintaining relations in such a large group is a delicate proposition But the pay-off is clear Like a fierce tribe the "wow crowd" dominates other alliances and can aggressively pursue its goal of capturing females It's easy to lose sight of the females' role in all this In fact, she is the motivating force behind much of this Machiavellian male behavior The females of most dolphin species have a mating strategy of their own And it calls for multiple sexual partners So in spite of the males' best efforts to restrict the females' choice it's not entirely successful This spotted dolphin female in the Bahamas mates with a number of eager males Any one of these partners may end up being the father of her calf In a surprising way this strategy may protect her future offspring A female dolphin will usually give birth to a single calf after a year long pregnancy It'll be a few years before this one becomes spotted like its mother After giving birth the female is unreceptive during the calf's first few years She will spurn the advances of courting males But young males can be dangerously persistent Adult male dolphins may do more than simply harass females They are strongly suspected of killing dolphin calves a possible strategy for making the female receptive again This time the mother fights them off In Shark Bay, a female, Nicky cruises the shallows with her calf She's being herded by Bottomhook and Pointer Like most female dolphins she's mated with a number of partners So the scientists are not sure who the father of the calf is But then neither are Bottomhook and Pointer And in their uncertainty, the calf is spared Finding food is the mother's top priority and here in Shark Bay she's discovered some surprising resources There's something enchanting about coming in contact with dolphins in the wild The activity is carefully monitored to avoid potential harm to dolphins or to humans Please, please don't reach out to her head, please That's Nicky; she will bite you Trust me She hasn't bitten anybody since yesterday... If you're lucky enough to be called out Just step out Hold the fish by the tail Not the dolphin... Place right down into the dolphins mouths Please do not be tempted to touch during the feeding that's when we can have accidents This kind of interaction between humans and wild dolphins occurs in very few places For some, it's a healing experience For others a kind of mystical, New Age encounter But to the hungry dolphins it's mostly about getting a fish If there's a lesson here for the calf it's that a dolphin must always be inventive in finding food For out in the wild it's no easy task Calves are dependent on their mothers for some three to six years During this period the young dolphin must learn how to fend for itself Like humans, dolphins are not born with the skills to survive The learning process may start through simple mimicry The calf will imitate its mother's every pose posture and action If she stands with her tail in the sand the calf will follow suit Even though it may not have an inkling of why she's doing so Dolphins are opportunistic feeders and the young must learn many extremely difficult and creative hunting techniques The mother is using sound in a way the calf may not be capable of just yet The buzzing sound is a series of rapid fire clicks part of a sophisticated sensory system called echolocation The sound signals penetrate the sands then echo back, giving a clear indication of what lies below It's like X-ray vision capable of seeing through almost any porous medium Dolphin calves can create sounds shortly after birth mostly whistles used for communication The clicks required for echolocation may take months to develop Like most intelligent predators dolphins learn to hunt by making a game out of it This trunkfish is not part of their diet but for the young dolphins it's a target to practice on It takes an adult to demonstrate proper form Calves often wander away from their mothers sometimes up to half a mile Though it can be dangerous taking risks is an important part of learning These young dolphins may not very adept but at least they're catching fish on their own The mortality rate for young dolphins is very high In Shark Bay fifty percent don't survive their first year Much depends on how quickly the calf can master new skills for survival A mother leads her calf on strenuous runs in the shallows The calf can barely keep up This is basic training for a difficult and dangerous fishing strategy It's a skill passed on from generation to generation The techniques that dolphin calves learn are often unique to where they live The steep cliffs of Cape Peron block the prevailing winds creating calm clear waters along the beach. Shallows can be dangerous places for dolphins Strandings are not uncommon and here they can easily be cornered by predators But the shallow water is a hunting ground for a small group of specialists Here they practice a fishing technique other dolphins find too risky The shallows would seem to favor the smaller creature But the dolphin has mastered the art of hydroplaning skimming through mere inches of water Sometimes breathing air has its advantages The sea eagle who's watched the chase with intense interest times his swoop perfectly Of the four to five hundred dolphins in Shark Bay only a handful of females have mastered this technique Often dolphins play with their catch before eating it Just offshore a dolphin tosses a snake eel about like a ragdoll The others approach the tossed prey with great interest But they will not touch it observing some kind of protocol Scientists have speculated it's a way of confirming trust or simply avoiding a costly conflict When calves catch their tiny fish they too make a great show of it By five or six years old young dolphins no longer need their mother's guidance They will be part of a hunting culture that will forever be as challenging as it is perilous Dolphins have adapted to an alien world that is hostile to air-breathing mammals In the dark of night dolphins need to know what's out there Using their echolocation dolphins can detect the size shape- even the density of an object But it's only good for a hundred yards or so and is highly directional detecting nothing from behind It's so accurate they can clearly distinguish between different species of fish Even in daylight visibility is limited underwater But using sonar can be risky because the tell-tale clicks may reveal your presence to predators So dolphins rely more on their excellent hearing The best defense is to stay together keep silent - and listen Success in hunting is knowing when to use your sonar and when to turn it off With its own sonar turned off a killer whale moves silently through Alaskan waters - listening It can hear the slightest splashing the very breathing of distant prey A group of Dall's porpoises just up ahead These are among the fastest small cetaceans so quick and agile they can elude most predators They travel these icy waters in groups of two to ten But for this small herd there's little safety in numbers As quietly as possible the killer whales are closing in The slightest sound would betray their presence The porpoises detect something But it may be too late The killers are capable of speeds up to thirty miles per hour The porpoise zigzags for its life Killer whales are masters at cutting off the path of retreat This one dives below a harbor porpoise Like sharks killer whales don't always finish off their prey right away They'll often let the victim struggle until it's energy is spent or it simply bleeds to death Other members of the pod move in on a Dall's porpoise that's been hit It still has some life left and tries to make it to calmer inshore waters The males- like lions tend to leave the hunting to the females Now they join in for the kill Soon the restless seas are resonating with the eerie calls of the killers and the chilling sounds of teeth crushing bone The porpoise had the unhappy fate to be pursued by hunters with sensory capabilities as good as its own For killer whales are dolphins They are the largest member of the family and the only dolphins that habitually hunt their cousins Still, they're the most sociable of all dolphins living in highly stable family groups Most of the males never leave the group they are born in Some will even teach the calves how to hunt This unfortunate harbor seal is about to become a living training tool The killer whales circle the prey as if toying with it In fact they may be demonstrating to their young how to cut off a prey's retreat or how to confuse it More important the calves will learn how to coordinate their efforts with others in the pod Older males have been observed allowing calves to feed before they themselves begin to eat The young will grow into the ocean's top predators Like killer whales, pilot whales are misnamed and are true dolphins The second largest of the family they can weigh up to four tons Pilot whales dive to depths of a half mile in search of octopus and squid These pygmy killer whales may be every bit as fierce as their namesakes And like their bigger cousins, they're believed to kill marine mammals But pygmy killers are very rare and seldom observed in the wild There are over thirty species of dolphins and we know very little about most of them The northern right whale dolphin is a gregarious creature often found swimming with other species like white-sided dolphins. Dolphins come in a variety of sizes and shapes What distinguishes them as a family are anatomical features like the shape of the jaws and teeth Dolphins are designed for the hunt This fifty ton monster is a grazer not a hunter And it's a true whale Southern right whales are filter feeders straining enormous quantities of water for tiny crustaceans The windswept shores of Patagonia in Argentina Once a year right whales migrate to breed in the warm shallow waters Here they are greeted by dusky dolphins Unlike their big lumbering cousins duskys are small fast, and agile In the summer months they leave the safety of coastal waters to hunt miles offshore In deep waters, locating pursuing and catching prey is exceptionally difficult But duskys have developed some extraordinary tactics In the morning, small search parties set out probing with their sonar There may be twenty to thirty groups patrolling these waters each pod separated by a mile or two The leaps give them a vantage point for sighting prey Seabirds have gathered up ahead a sign they've found something This time of year Southern anchovies are here in vast numbers For the penguins it's a feast It's up to the dolphins to bring some order to all this and they quickly do The dolphin's strategy is to circle the school and drive it into an ever tightening ball They guard the outside perimeter by blowing bubbles which frightens the fish This takes advantage of the fishes' natural defense to huddle together when attacked As the fish ball gets tighter the duskys take turns grabbing mouthfuls of fish then retreat to guard the perimeter Soon the ball is clustered so tightly the fishes' escape response breaks down Now it's simply a matter of the dolphins' nipping food off the edges As the feeding progresses the dolphin calves are nowhere to be seen For others drawn to the feast might prefer young dolphin to a mouthful of anchovies Mothers bring their calves to a sort of nursery away from the chaos of the feeding area For the rest of the group the feeding's over and it's time to celebrate The event is marked by exhilarating acrobatic displays Dolphin groups that usually travel apart now come together to socialize In the world of dolphins that means frequent sex with a variety of partners The males- swimming upside down follow the females They synchronize their movement with hers all for a brief moment of coupling Physical contact among these groups of dolphins strengthens communal bonds For cooperative hunters these bonds are essential The duskys are about to face a challenge that calls for teamwork on monumental scale Sixty feet below the surface, a monstrous swirl of life undulates like a strange super organism It's a mass of anchovies over a hundred feet in diameter For these duskys it's the mother lode Circling the fish with violent splashes the duskys corral them closer together A team of dolphins works below the school herding it towards the surface They must keep the enormous mass together If it splits into smaller schools they'll be hard to control Finally, they succeed in herding the great ball of fish to the surface It serves as a wall, closing off one avenue of escape Now sea lions are drawn to the scene The dolphins struggle to keep the school together but the sea lions are not team players They plunge into the mass of fish to feed The school is simply too large for the dolphins to control Now the leaps serve a different purpose High and acrobatic they're calls for help From miles away, other duskys rush to the feeding site They porpoise high in the air to keep sight of the action ahead By the time they reach the school there's a feeding frenzy going on Chaos reigns and the ball is in danger of splitting apart The new arrivals get right to work and quickly coordinate their efforts with the other duskys Now there are enough dolphins to guard the perimeter while they take turns feeding Finally all the dolphins' hard work pays off The fish have been packed together so long they've consumed too much oxygen There's little chance the ball will split apart For the dolphins who can now feed at will this hunt is over To ancient mariners the dolphins' mastery of the ocean world seemed magical They were cast as heroes in myth and legend Today we look for glimpses of ourselves in dolphins And we find them in their conflicts yes - but also in the ways they communicate and cooperate their sheer inventiveness. But there's no need to romanticize or humanize dolphins to respect them for what they are Strong and intelligent hunters in a wilderness called the sea
