One more day and we are home. When you hear the toucan, danger is near. The Fierce People. I killed a monkey. By yourself? My father let me. We saw the Fierce People. A war party of the Fierce People is very close. We must be prepared. I will watch. Mother, it's for you. Honey. My new son! Girls from Paranita. Who's she? That's Kachiri. Little Kachiri? You like her? You will scare the fish. You won't spear a fish. But a fish is going to spear you. Tomme, you think you are a man... but I only see a stupid boy. Your time has come to die. Must he die? Yes. I will never see my boy again. The boy is dead... and the man is born. I saw green stones in a waterfall. You have seen the Sacred Stones. It was the place we lived in before the Fierce People came. From these stones comes the paint that makes us the Invisible People. Just these are left. I will go to that place and find more stones. I need you and you need me. Now you are a man. You say what other men say to me. I will find the Sacred Stones... which is more than other men can do. The Fierce People will catch you. I will be invisible. They will cook you and eat you... even the grandfathers without teeth. I am invisible. My name is Tomme. We go to my father. He will help you. I am your father. No, you are Daddee. You live in there, when I dream. Now you are here. Come. Listen. The frogs. A big rain comes. Your mother,Jean, can you remember her? The Stones. The Sacred Stones. I killed five fierce warriors. Five! He is Daddee. I told you about him... the one in my dreams. Hey, Daddee. Yes, we know you. When a dream becomes fesh... trouble is not far behind. He has a fever. He is near death. Father, surely you can cure him. Even a great storm... cannot always quench a forest fire. Wanadi, do it. If it can be done... I will do it. Daddee. Can you hear me? He will hear you. I will suck out the evil fire. The evil fire is gone. You see... he is a great healer. Now, he must sleep. I will show you a great secret. Watch the fire. Why did you take my son? One day, I was hunting at the Edge of the World... when Tomme appeared... and he smiled... and even though you were a Termite Child... I had not the heart... to send you back to The Dead World. Why are they called The Termite People? They come into The World... and chew down all the grandfather trees. Just like termites. I want your daughter... but I give you the Sacred Stones. - Kachiri, you will tend the fire. - No! I tend to my father's fire. Do it right. You like it? I made it for you. Tomme needs Kachiri... and Kachiri needs Tomme. You need me? You are well? She is yours if you have need. Need? Yes. Eat and be strong... then you will have need. Shall we go to the river and bathe? We have crushed the sacred stones. And once again they... shine in our war paint. You are well. I want you to come with me. Momme wants you to come home. He is finished with mothers. I am his woman now. You stole my son. He took you from me, from Momme. That was long ago. I just want you to see the home that you came from. This is my home. It will be the home of my children. Daddee, you must rest here... and we must hunt. For tonight is the feast of Tomme and Kachiri. Stop. You are the chief. Tell him to come and visit. He can choose. If I tell a man... to do what he does not want to do... I am no longer chief. Why are you so sad? Ten years, Tomme... looking for you... all over. Yes. It is good to hunt... to track an animal. You should be happy. But no, you feel sad. It will be a good feast tonight. I must return. Why go back to that terrible place? You can stay... and become a great warrior and hunter. My family is there. It is where I belong. Bring the pipe. I swore to Tommy's mother... I would bring him back. Your heart is torn. If you take him, you'll wish you had not. If you don't take him you will wish you had. You are a man of courage. You have traveled far... and you have come to the center of the world. Now you can go farther and see more. But you cannot enter that place naked. It is our way. Accept our gift, Daddee... You will meet your spirit animal and he will show you. When I was a boy... the Edge of the World was very far... but every year it comes closer. The Fierce Ones came before dawn. Mother! There was a terrible noise. They had spears that make lightning. Did you see Kachiri? I ran away. Father, they have killed Uluru. I cannot find Kachiri. The fire will set free their souls to the stars. And what is left of the dead must be crushed. Crushed into dust. In here is the dust of those who went before us... even the First Man and First Woman. Now drink in memory of what we have been... and the lives of those who went before us... will live inside us. Drink, boy. You come too. They are taking the Skin off The World. How will she breathe? There was a great river there once. What is that? It's like... a log jam. This was the home of the Fierce People. Now we know why they came to our part of The World. Father, there! Come back. We are not invisible in The Dead World. But Father! No. We go along The Edge of The World. Look. Strange trees and vines. We can climb up. Go across the vine and down. If we attack now we will all die. But without our women we will be a people no more. Father-- Put me down. I must die. Brother, set my soul free with fire. Add a few grains of my bones... to the dust of those that went before us. Son... do what I could not do. I will, Father. Do as my father says. Take his body back... and wait for me there. What? Where will you go? I will go beyond The Edge of The World. To find my other father. He knows about the Lightning Spears. I will ask him to help us. How do you know this is the way? He told me he lives at the end of The-River-Without-Water. The-River-Without-Water ends here. Daddee lives here? He said his village... has more people than ants in an ant hill. Could that be it? I know you. You are The Invisible People. Come. Hurry. So there are still people like you. We once lived out there, not far from them. You called us The Bat People. Because you hunted at night. My father told me many stories about your tribe. Why do you come here? We seek what you call A White Man. Can you help us? What's he called? Bil. He said he was called Bil. Seor Bil? It's not enough. The people here have many names. You must know them all... and each living place has a number. Did he tell you any numbers? No. We cannot wait. I must find him. I will look through the darkness of what-has-been. I have seen. I remember. Wait for the war cry. I have told them to wait for the war cry. Wait for the war cry. Go. This way. Go. Go. You are not Fierce. Father... we will tell our children... the story of what you did for us. You will always live in our hearts... and in our dreams. Tommie, my son. Do you see that? Do you know what it is? Wanadi said... it is a big log jam. Yes. Lots of logs and the river... cannot flow. Because of that log jam... more white people will come here... and enter the world and cut down more trees... and take what is yours. They will not find us. We are The Invisible People. They will, Tommie. They will see you. Father... if that is a log jam... water can break it. No. A great food of water can break it. No. Not this kind of log jam. You remember. The frogs sing and it rains. We will ask the frogs to sing very loud. The rain? It has been raining for two days. We have been to the river. A big food is coming. ...and every stream has its spirit snake... and all the spirit snakes meet in the big river... and twist around each other... to become one, the greatest one... the greatest spirit of all spirits... The Great Anaconda... and nothing can stop the Great Anaconda... not even a log jam.. because it is angry, very... very angry. See. Samanpo and Caya. And Mapi? Mapi and Kaba. It is time to settle these matters. And Jabuti? It will be Pucu... but they do not know it yet. There will be some without men. You should marry one or two of them. If you say so. There is only you, Kachiri.
