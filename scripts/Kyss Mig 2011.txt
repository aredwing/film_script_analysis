Is that all I'm getting? OK...So that's how today's gonna go? Hey... Happy birthday! - Oscar... - Hold on... Say something to the camera that describes Lasse. Damn... - What is it? - It's sis and her boyfriend. They're running late. Nononono... What are they doing? I think your mom is slightly faster... Well I think your dad is a horndog. Look, it fits perfectly I'll never take it off. You promise? Of course I do. Come on... ...grab a cigarette first... - It's not aligned... - Shh! - It's not aligned... Come on you little muppet... Should I say to dad... or do you want to do it? No of course you should say it. It's your dad. I'm sorry... Can I borrow a lighter from you? It's not lit... Frida! Swearword there you are, hi! Have you been here long or what? No we just came. She introduced herself? - No. -No. This is Mia, my sister... And this is Tim, her boyfriend. Frida, Elizabeth's daughter. Oh, ok! OK well let's not stand here all day. Thank you so much for that... But above all for this... ...fantastic food that Oscar and Frida have organised. I get so nervous when I'm to speak in these contexts... But uhm, it feels quite touching that you're all here. For my sixtieth. And above all to celebrate that... ...Elizabeth and I are getting engaged. And above all, a great thank you to Elisabeth for saying yes. Well, look here, come in. Hello! Hello dad! Hello! One more surprise. This is my daughter Mia, this is... this is...(Hello Tim!) This is Tim. This is great! Well, now I'm completely surronded by love. and now I'm just going to sit down next to Elisabeth and relax And we are going to have it fucking amazing, right? Hello, now the big gift arrived. Now i'm getting emotional. Mia just told me that she and Tim are going to get married. Hello Mia, nice to meet you, congratulations, welcome. Hello Tim, congratulations. Sorry for just interrupting like this but I would also like to say a few words. I'll start with you Lasse. We may not always be in agreement about everything. That's OK too I guess. But you make above all my mom very happy. And that's all I care about. And mom, you really deserve the best. And we have in some strange way, blended together as a family very quickly... ...and I am so happy about that. Where are you Oscar? So I hope things continue in the same direction. And above all that you stay as happy... ...as you seem to be now. So I would also like to propose a toast. To mom and Lasse! Elisabeth seems lovely. Elisabeth is amazing. I know you're going to like her. You seem like you're well Dad. I'm really well. Can't we take a walk tomorrow morning, like usual? Like when I was little, you mean? What are you doing? Are you flirting with her? Huh? With who? With Frida, of course. You seem to enjoy each other's company anyway. Well, I didn't get any on the plane. -Good morning! -Good morning! -Is it free? -Sure, just go in. Dad? Hey, I think they're still asleep. Hi! Should we go for a walk then? Hi Tim, thanks for yesterday. I thought we were supposed to were walking together this morning. Are you sulking? No, I'm not sulking. I think you're sulking. Tim, she's sulking, right? She is definitely sulking. Mia sulks when Mia doesn't get what Mia wants. Well, I was thinking of asking you to come to Fyn with us. And give advice on the house extension. But I realize it's the wrong time... No, I would love to do it. As long as I get some alone time with you. I have barely seen you yet. Of course. Guys, how about a toast? Cheers Tim, how's the firm going? It's going pretty well actually. Obviously things are always tough in the beginning, but I think with time, things will go...really well We just received a huge project. Great, congratulations. And when will I become a grandfather? Stop nagging Dad. Yeah we're in no rush. Yeab but don't wait too long will you. I don't want to be in a home when he or she comes along. Lasse! Time to take it down a notch, don't you think? Thank you Elisabeth. Why should all the pressure be on me? Frida might beat me to it, right? Yeah... Yeah, absolutely! Where are you going on honeymoon Mia? We don't know. We haven't even found a dress yet, so I guess we haven't had time to think about it. No we haven't. I was actually thinking about wearing mom's dress. Unless you object. Not at all darling. Why would I? Mia is nothing like I thought. No? Did you think she would be more like Oskar? Maybe. Mia is more like her mother. Is everything okay between the two of you? Why do you ask that? Doesn't it seem like it? Dad really didn't like that thing about the dress. Did you notice? Maybe you should listen to him. Stop filming...! I'm not in the mood! Did you cheat? God you're so curious. Were you? No I've never cheated nor will I ever. I can't think of anything worse. Same here. Especially considering how Dad's been at it. I guess it's like Sis' says. We inherited Mom's faithful genes. That's good... That feels different now that he's met Elisabeth. Does it? Sure. He's so mellow these days. And by the way. Sure you might have kids before Mia and Tim. That's so sweet of you. Mia's lucky to have you. You're like, the best baby brother ever. I'm just trying to do my job . What do you mean by I should listen to him? Don't you like the dress? Honestly? It's an ugly 70's dress. What does it matter? What is it that's so important to you about that dress? I don't know, I've always liked it since I was little. I've always told Mom I'm going to wear it when I get married. I just want our wedding to be as perfect as possible. I just want us to be happy. I don't want some dress or your dad to ruin that for us. ... I noticed. Maybe you should go instead of me. I have to work. Why don't you buy one of those? I'll call you when I get there Oh good, it's Aston's, he's one of my students. You can just put it back there. I know it's none of my business but I have to ask. Sure, just ask. Oskar and you, are you together or something? What? I don't know, I just think it's a bit... So? What is it to you? Is it the age difference you're talking about or what? I guess I'm a few years older than him, is that it? Excuse me? 'What business is it of yours?' We'll soon be in the same family. Don't you think that's a bit... No but, well we don't even have the same parents. You make it sound like total inbreeding. But I have to say, your little brother is insanely good in bed. Oh my God, I don't want to hear that! Why? He is... You were kidding about you and Oskar, of course? Well, yes. I can't help but tease you, you seem so anal. Oh God, I'm sorry, I don't mean anal in that way, not anal-anal. It's okay. Oskar said it's been a while since you've been home for a visit. Yeah. Since last Christmas. Yes, okay. Well, Lasse seems a bit... it feels like he'sa bit different when you're at home. I'm sorry, it might be because I'm so anal, but it's been a long time since someone analyzed me like this. No but, oh my God, I didn't mean to analyze. It was an observation. You, well... I'm sorry for what happened on the ferry, that I was so... Charmless? Yes, exactly. Mia! Would you mind coming outside for a bit? Raspberry? Here I thoughtmaybe an extension, maybe a guesthouse with a glassed porch. What do you think? Yeah that might be nice. A glass verandah here with a view toward the woods maybe. Hey where is dad? He had a meeting in town. So he's not coming? No. Didn't he tell you? That's a little weird. Well, Ill go inside and start dinner now, so can you and Frida unpack? Well eat soon. Hi, this is Lasse Sundstrm. Leave a message and I'll call you back. Thanks, bye. Damn it, you can't do this. Damn it, you can't just not show up and leave me alone on a deserted island in the middle of nowhere! Hell, I don't know these people. Thank you so bloody much! Well, where is Mia then? I don't know. I can go see where she is. Bring a flashlight, maybe she got lost. She's from the city. She was going to make a phone call. I know she can be a bit hard to get to know. You think?! Well, you can be nice to her, right? I know! Here, bring some wine and cigarettes. That will be good. What do you mean "nice?" I'm always nice. Now go. So this is where you're hiding. You want some wine? -Please. Have you ever been married? No, The closest I ever came was an engagement that lasted for exactly 5 months, 3 weeks and 2 days. What happened? I discovered I was engaged to someone I didn't know. I thought I did, but I didn't. Someone who turned your world upside down. No, well, I don't know if I've even met anyone like that. I don't know if I even want someone to do that. Thanks. I can't believe you seriously thought I was together with Oskar. Why? I don't know you. No, but you're funny. I like it. Come on, I'll show you something. I think they should be here somewhere. Look... There's more coffee if you want? You...? No thanks. Yeah, I was wondering if you have car rental. So there's no other way of getting off the island? Mia! You want come with us and go fishing? Why did you kiss me? We can't pretend that it didn't happen. So, should we leave then? Yeah... We're going swimming. We'll be back later. So you like...? Girls, yes. You didn't know? Why did you kiss me? I don't know. I just did it. Are you getting weirded out? I love Tim I understand but it's possible to be attracted to several people. Attracted... I'm not like you. Okay Are you sure? Of course I'm sure. Did something happen? No. No, I'm just tired Hi! Good morning! Sleep well? Let's leave then. Take it easy mom. It's a sensitive engine. It takes a while for it to start up. Bless you. Frida how many times have I told you to ask someone to look at this car? I know that Mom. But you telling me doesn't help. It's not gonna start because of you telling me. We'll have to take the bus. It's just as well, we'll miss the ferry if we don't. We can make this bus if we go now. Did something happen, or what? No. Are you mad at me? I like you so much, Frida but it's a mess right now, you understand? Yes, I get that. But I'm right here. You can talk to me. Frida, I love Tim. I don't believe that. We have a whole life together. I know that you feel something for me. In a few months I'm getting married to Tim. I can't feel this way about you, don't you get it? It's impossible. Then you'll have to stay with him then. I just wanted you to get to know each other It might have been stupid. I'm here to see you Dad. I wanted to show you what I've been doing at work, talk to you about the wedding. Don't you see I need to do that? Sure, talk! Focus on this. Pull it tighter. Come on! Harder! Are you still serious about wearing Mom's dress to the wedding? The most important day of your life? If it's meant as a gibe I don't think it's worth it. What are you talking about? I know you think it's my fault that Mom and I got divorced. But we were two about it. Yeah... But only one of you was fucking her best friend and lying about it! Why do you always have to take her side? We had problems long before that. OK. What does that have to do with the dress? Why do you think it's a gibe? Listen. Me being unfaithful... I don't want to hear about your fucking infidelity, don't you get that?! OK I get that, I get that. Hasn't it done enough damaged to this family already? Should we put up the net now or what? Do you want to play or not? No! I did this for your sake. Hey, time to eat! Yes! Pull a bit harder then! I think it's damn selfish of you to just not show up at the country house. I just think you have such a great relationship with Frida... Can I have the sallad? Yes Thanks. Anyone want some bread? Thank you, we're good. Mia, did you tell them that we're looking for a house? That's nice! What a great investment. Well, we've been looking for something small, maybe to expand later. Have you found anything? Eh, no. We looked at a few places but there hasn't been anything that interesting. No, I can't. I can't... stay here. I had a kebab earlier and I don't feel well. I'll take the car, I think, home. Kebab? Yes. Since when do you eat meat? Well, it was a vegetarian kebab. A... A vebab. A vebab? Exactly. What is that? Isn't the whole point of kebab the meat? Or tofu... My God, that doesn't sound tasty at all. But Frida, you've had a lot of wine. I'm calling you a taxi. I can drive you. It's ok... Why would you gorge on a vebab if you're not into meat? I don't get that kind of thing. Maybe you don't always get everything Lasse. God, I missed you I made dinner, come on. What is it? Did I misunderstand about the dress? Huh? Did something happen? Is everything OK between you and Tim? Did you fight? Mom and I also fought a lot when we were about to get married. It's nerves. It's nothing Dad. It's just... Can't you tell me what's going on? I'm just tired, you know. Hey, tomorrow... Why don't you show me your drafts and we can hang out all day. What are you doing? I'm going home with you. Home? I thought you were staying a week. Yeah but I...changed my mind. Going back home really isn't your thing is it. Aren't you gonna bring her flower inside? She gave you such a lovely vase. It's not a flower. It's an orchid. And it's stood here thirty years Elisabeth. If you gave as much care to your family as you do your orchids everything might be different. Maybe we should say goodbye to Oscar...? Ssh, I just want to go home. God, it's great being home again. If I ever want to go back, remind me of this trip. What happened there? I ran into a tree branch on the island, city kid, you know. I think need to go to the office for a bit now. No, don't bother. Do it tomorrow instead. What is it? I love you. I love you, Tim. Plastic headboards. We'd need to do something about these floors. A fireplace? I've always dreamt of having one. It would be nice in winter. Jakobsberg... What's wrong with Jakobsberg? It's so dull out there. And when you get pregnant, we won't even have room for a nursery. "When I get pregnant". That could take ages. Not if you stop taking birth control. It would take a year to a year and a half. What do you mean, I don't want kids now. You know that. Maybe not "now" now, but in the near future. You do want kids with me? We are getting married right? If we're gonna have kids, then that requires planning! You can't plan everything. It doesn't work like that. Well then, explain to me how things work!? I'm sorry about yesterday. You are right. I panic when you're deciding everything. Don't you get how stressful that is? Well, you need someone to keep you in line. What did you say? Look at Oskar. He's coming here on Thursday. He grew a mustache. He looks insane. He looks like a psychopath, doesn't he? Frida? It's very empty and lonely here. Can't you come over here? I'm coming. I'm coming. No... What? Well... I don't know. It's like you've been on another planet these past two weeks I barely recognize you. What is it? No, I... I will leave you alone. Do you want to come to our place to eat tonight? Eh, I can't. Why do you never come to our place for dinner anymore? Did something happend? No. But Frida, what is it? Well, I don't know how to say this. Me and Mia we... Mia? Well, something happened between her and me. Something? Can you please try to explain? Eh... I think Mia is bisexual but I don't think she wants to see it like that And what the hell does that mean? That I'm in love with her. Oh dear God, I asked you to be a bit nice to her, not to fall in love with her. Well, I totally misunderstood you because to fall in love with her was my plan all along. How the hell can you stand there and joke about something like this?! You can love anyone you want but not Lasse's daughter, do you get it? Anyone, but not her! What should I do? It's not like I'm proud of myself right now. And Elin? Yes, she doesn't know, but she gets it, of course. After you've been put through the exact same thing yourself. Maybe you remember how devastated you were? Do you? And now you're putting Elin through the exact same thing. Yeah... Damn that's low, Frida. Yeah... What were you thinking?! No, I haven't been thinking. No, you haven't. No. No, I have never cheated, and I never will either. It's the absolutely worst thing I know. Are you at home? Yes. I waited for you for over an hour. Well, I couldn't come. I missed you. What is it? I can't. What? You? I hate it so much to be doing this to you. Who is it? It's Mia. Oskar's sister. Must be hard for Lasse to get two dykes in the family. Since he's been having such a hard time with us. I'm in love with her. So you've been cheating on me with Mia? Who is getting married to her boyfriend? What the hell are you doing? Well, I really don't want to do this to you. I understand exactly what you're feeling right now. Understand... You know what the most disgusting part is? I really thought you were better than this. You're just an experiment to her. She will never leave him. Do you get that? Someone was hungover when they treaded this. Give me the glass! Now tell me about that mustache. Is it some age related crisis? I dunno. It just is. Tim got all freaked out. He said I had to shave it off if I wanted to be his best man. Can I kidnap him this weekend? Drag him to the archipelago. A bachelor's party or something. Sure. Do that. Have you heard from Dad by the way? Yeah everything's good. You haven't heard from him? I'm meant to say hi from Frida by the way. She's here this weekend. With her school, She's doing a concert at stra Real. We can hang out then, it's cool. I talked to Frida. Hm... Is everything alright? Well, not really, actually She is in love with your daughter. What did you say? Come again? From what I gather, Mia has feelings for Frida too. But Mia is engaged with Tim. Yes I know, maybe she is bisexual then. No, I don't think so. Let's eat now, sit down! Are you kidding, or what? Haricots verts? So it's okay that my daughter is gay but not Mia? My daughter is not homosexual, Elisabeth. Maybe you think it's wrong maybe you think it's a bit disgusting? Did I say that? But it's not completely normal, right? Well, it's not completely fucking normal. No parents really want their child to be gay or lesbian, if we're completely honest Elisabeth. So Frida isn't normal? Lasse when Frida came out, it wasn't easy, I admit. but today I'm very happy that she is who she is. That she stands up for who she is. She wouldn't be my daughter otherwise. Let's stop talking about this now, okay? How would that solve anything, huh? Lasse? This is completely insane! Who the hell are you, really? What the hell are you thinking right now? God damn it! Mia! I shouldn't have come. I have to... I have to go. Oskar couldn't make it and he's sending his hello... Wait, wait, wait, wait... Just give me five minutes and I will send the kids home with their parents. Wait for me. Don't go. I'm so happy that you're here. Did you hide here, or what? I want to go away with you, far away. Do you want to? "You left a lovestain on my heart" "And you left a bloodstain on the ground" "But blood comes off easily" "But blood comes off easily" "You left a lovestain on my heart" "And you left a bloodstain on the ground" "But blood comes off easily" "But blood comes off easily" I think you've been lying a little bit to me. Why? I'm hardly your first girl. No, can you tell? Yeah, you could say that. I thought about it on Fyn too. Why haven't you told me? Are you ashamed? No. I just didn't think I would feel like this again. Were you in love with her? Will you be jealous if I say yes? Eh, yes, absolutely. Does Tim know? No. It was much earlier. I've never cheated on him, until now. I want to be with you all the time. I don't just want to be someone you're cheating on Tim with. If I had the choice, I would build a house by the ocean somewhere Andalusia, or Catalonia. I could live with you in a shoebox. Seriously? Yeah. Imagine if we did that. Just left you and me. Started over somewhere else. Why can't we start over here then? Is that too realistic for you? Not romantic enough? Frida. Frida! I've never felt as strongly about anyone as I do about you in my entire life. But you just want to run away all the time. Start over, huh? Do you know how much I'd want to do that. But you're getting married to Tim in three months. I am so stupid. What are we doing? Do you love him? You can't marry Tim. I won't be able to handle that. Dad, did something happen? No, I just wanted to hear your voice. And say thank you for the vase I got. I'm not sure I did. Okay, you're welcome. Was it nice? Yes, sure. My call woke you up, didn't it? I didn't know how late it was. Let's hang up. Okay. Fine, bye then. Bye. We could live like this, couldn't we? This is almost like a shoebox. I wouldn't want to live like this. It's not real. Shutting ourselves in a room miles away from everything. It's hard for me, Frida. I'm not as brave as you are. I just wish no one would question us. I want them to ask. I'm proud of you. I want to show everyone how much I like you. One o'clock at Mosebacke, then? I think I've known that about Mia the whole time. What? Yes, even if it only was suspicions I had a hard time dealing with it. You know, when Frida told me, I remember I thought, in complete panic, about everything I'd miss out on. You know, wedding, becoming a grandma, all those things. But, now I know better. Yes, I just want her to be fine. I'm going to the city to take care of some things. Now? We're leaving soon. What? To the church. It was you who arranged a meeting with the pastor at one o'clock. Well, well, you're nervous now, aren't you? Weddings are actually over really quickly, so I want you to really cherish the time you have here in front with me. It goes like this: first you say your vows to each other, then I turn to you Tim, your full name... Tim Aron Bratthall. Tim Aron, that's a nice name, Bratthall. Do you take this... Maria. Yes, and then you have to speak much louder when it's for real, because aunt Beda should hear you too. Once more, a bit louder. Maria Eva Sundstrm. Maria Eva Sundstrm to be your wife. Yes. And then we reverse it so it's your turn, and then the obligatory kiss. Bada-bing, bada-bom. Then you are married, till death do you part. Finished. I can't. I'm sorry. She's just nervous, for sure. Go talk to her and then come back. Mia! Eh, this happens all the time. all the time... Oh my, oh my God. Mia! MIA!! MIA!! FRIDA! FRIDA! Wait. So lucky, I thought you had left. Mia, I can't do this. I just left Tim in the church. I can't marry him. I'm in love with you. But you're not done with him. You're not done with your life. What happened today, when I sat there waiting for you because you were with him. It will be like that all the time, won't it? I needed to wake up from this dream with you and today I did. Don't you understand what I'm sacrificing... Jesus christ, you're not the only one making sacrifices! This isn't just about you. Frida, please, don't go. But you're not fighting for this! Yes I am, I'm here now. No you're not! I... Frida don't go. FRIDA! It's the wedding menus. They just came. Done. What timing. I've been looking everywhere for you. I have nothing to say to you. But I am thinking about what we're going to say to our families and our friends. Regrettably, the wedding is cancelled. Mia is apparently a dyke. How do you... how do you know? I saw you and Frida. You fucking asshole. I'm really sorry you found out about it like this. Get the fuck out. Get the fuck out! Leave, dammit! Leave! I think the biggest reason Tim and I were getting married was that everyone was expecting it. Are you ashmed of me? I just want you to be happy and healthy. I don't feel like I have a choice, dad. This is me. Do you think it's my fault? Does it have to be anyone's fault Why Frida? Because I love her. Seven years, Mia, seven years. I thought I knew who I was building a life with. I am so sorry Tim. You don't exist to me anymore. I'm going to Skne with dad. I'll move out when I get back. Hi. Is Frida here? No, she's not here. Do you know where she is? Are you Mia? Can you tell me where she is? Not on your life. Where is Frida? Elisabeth, do you know where she is? She needs peace and quiet, Mia. And you're not exactly what I'd call peace and quiet to her right now. I have made a complete fool of myself, don't you understand that? I have nothing left. If you know where she is, please tell me, now. I really hope you know what you're doing. Let me see. Her flight to Barcelona leaves in 40 minutes. Now go. Flight 86869 is departing from Gate 7.
