If the 5th car, that drives by, - - is red, - - then you have to kiss me! One. Two. Two. Three. Hm! Four. Someone laughs. Nothing to understand. Shi... Shit! Zoey laughs. Oh, sorry! Keys! What? Give me the car keys! Why? Give me the fucking keys! Here! What's wrong? Huh? You're such a fucker, Tom! What's your problem? Did you not notice. Or do you just not care? Come again? What... There where enough other women. Come back over here! You fucking fucker! Shut the fuck up! (Both:) Shut you the fuck up! Veit! I like Zoey. How should I have known, - - that you wanted her? Yeah! How? You never said anything. You never opened your mouth. Yeah! It's always about you! As long as YOU have fun. Zoey! Do you not give a shit? Look out! Okay? Kiss my ass! Yeah, fine! Drive! Drive to your daddy! He's not waiting for you anyway. He never was. Shit! Ah shit! You left this in the hotel. Thanks! And us? Hm?... Hm? If, in the next 2 Minutes - - a bridge and groom come out of the church, - - then we'll see each other again. Thank you! Hello! Uh... I look for my father. He sends postcards. Every year. I don't know him. I'm sorry. And your coworkers? The other postmen? I don't think so. Hundreds of people come in here every day. Sorry. Okay! Sorry! - Thank you. - Next! You could have at least told me which post office it is. I've been running for 4 hours, my heels are sore and... Uh... Happy Birthday! That's from Zoey. And also... I'm really sorry! Really! I'm really sorry for what I said. You were such an asshole, ey! Such an asshole. Maybe my father won't go in immediately when he - - comes by here. First, I'd say hello. Are you scared? Yeah. Tom! Back there you can buy pizza for one dollar. Are you hungry? Yeah. You're not? Yeah, then it's settled. Yeah. Cheese or sausage? Salami! Salami. But hurry! Okay? Yeah! Excuse me! Hello! Um! Excuse me! Mr. Jagoda! Mr. Jagoda! Mr. Jagoda! Mr. Jagoda? It's crazy that you're really here!... Ach! Mr. Ja... You are Mr. Jagoda. Aren't you? What do you want from me? Excuse me! You don't know me. I am Tom. I'm here with Veit. We were waiting over there. He's getting pizza. Veit is here. We came all the way from Germany. Hello! Stay where you are! Hey, hey! Stay... I mean, after all these years, - - can't you at least... I am not his father. Wha... You're not his father? Here! What is that? What's that then? I mean it says right here: "Veit Jagoda". "Veit Jagoda"! Come over here! Come here! Listen to me! I had been waiting for 4 years - - for my trip to be approved. Okay? And then, in July 1979- - 3 men from the Stasi came to my door. One said that, under the right circumstances, they would - - approve my trip. To approve my application. You understand? I didn't have to write the postcards, only send them. A couple birthdays a year. A couple cards at Christmas. No, no! It became clear to me why I had to send these cards. But not until I was here, in America... You understand? ...did I realize that I was sending them for those who - - were killed trying to cross the Berlin Wall. His father is ded. He was shot trying to escape. Please! Yeah?... I cannot meet him. Please! Cheese, sausage! Treat every day like a gift - - and the world will give you a gift in return. Sausage. Hm! What's wrong? Hm? What's wrong? I'm sorry, Veit! But your... I mean - - your father certainly tried to do the right thing... But... He didn't write the postcards. I mean... Your father isn't alive. He's dead. What? ...Postcards... simply mailed. Muffled words What the man said... ...Stasi... Here! ...Stasi... Your father was... ...shot at the Berlin Wall. I'm sorry!... Wall... I'm sorry! Muffled words Nothing to understand. No sound. Brother of Hope? You the German commies? You the fucking commies? Man, I don't believe it! I told my brother he was sick, for trusting two German communists! The keys. You two are the nicest communists I've ever met. Come on in!
