Almost 15,000 troops get an eager glimpse of the U.S. of A. Past the towers of Manhattan steams the 83,000-ton British liner. These victorious G.I.s have done their duty. They answered their country's call, left their jobs, their families, their sweethearts... and beat the Nazi tyranny on a thousand battlefields. For some- the psychological victims of war- it will be a long road back. These men will need time to rebuild the lives they set aside when Uncle Sam called. For others- the G.I.s of the "Dear John" letters- it means starting over, replacing what they have lost. They faced one challenge and won. They can win this one too. Welcome home. Let dancing replace marching. I don't know how to tell you this. I really don't want to hurt you, but I just can't wait for you any longer. I know I promised to wait. I really did try, but it's been so much longer than either of us expected. So much has happened, and you're so far away. I hope you understand how I feel. I know I said I loved you, but I'm young... and I have to live my life now. And who knows how long it will be before you return. I hope you don't hate me for leaving you this way. But perhaps, when the war is over, we can be friends again. Please take care of yourself. I continue to worry about you. Sincerely, Rosemary. There's Tom Caldwell's Cadillac. Well, I'll be dogged. Say, who's he going out with now anyway? Linda Booth. Do you believe it? With Linda Booth? I thought she was going out with Georgie Wise. Didn't you hear? Well, I heard Georgie joined the air corps, all right, but- Wait a minute. Georgie didn't get- They broke up. Will you look at that? Aw, thats just a big old boat. Sweetheart, that car doesn't do you justice. You are precious. Now let's have a big hand for the band. Swell job, fellas. We were all saddened by the great Glenn Miller's tragic death... somewhere in the skies over France. But he left us a wonderful legacy in his music. And now for all those fine young men here tonight... just back from overseas, I'd like to ask the band to play one of his best tunes. Oh, look. There's Pat Kingsley. Well, Pat Kingsley just - just came home from the Pacific. So? Come on. Let's go up to the point. Oh, not now. It's too early. Come on. This place is dead. We'll come back later. Folks, I bet you never saw a more sober group of guys. Hey! Keep your mitts off my girl! The drummer told me his wife wouldn't let him in the house... if he ever showed up again... with that little brown jug. So let's cheer him up, and everybody swing! Who is that creep? Oh, that's just Jimmy Turner. He takes care of this place. What does he do, sweep it with his eye? No, but I hear he sleeps on an old mattress in the basement. Sounds like a swell guy. Oh, isn't it beautiful? If you really like it, I'll buy it for you. Oh, Roy. What's the matter - afraid somebody will tell your dad? He's just jealous. What do you mean? My dad's got even more money than he does. Want a slug? You sure know how to put a girl in the mood. Just call me Mr. Romance. Piece of cake, please. Did you see where Pat went? Sorry. That water looks great. We ought to go for a swim. We wouldn't even need suits. Roy? I'm only ribbing you. I don't want to swim. You're all I want. Come on. Come here, baby. Roy, I shouldn't. Okay. And while the boys go powder their noses, why don't all you chowhounds hustle your gals over to the refreshment table... and dig in. Roy. Roy? Come on. Come on, don't play hard to get. What about New Year's Eve? Well, that was different. I couldn't help myself. What if somebody sees us? You don't even have to take your dress off. You're so amazing. If one of your damn soldier friends shows his face around here, well, he's going to wish he was back overseas. No! No! No! Hey, you alive out there? Well, let's hear it! Yay! Whoa-oh! Looks a little crooked to me. Oh, yeah? How's that? Maybe a little bit higher. Like that? Is that better? Yeah. It looks great. Yeah. Mark. How about this side? Well, if it isn't Deputy London keeping an eye on things. Hi, guys. Hi. Hi, Pam. Hi, Mark. Well, I guess you don't need me anymore. Where you going'? Uh, to drop these off. The graduation edition? Yeah. We just finished this morning. You have a spare? Yeah, but we had to print these very small, and I wouldn't want you to strain your eyes twice in one day. Well, maybe you can read it to me over lunch. Okay. All right. I got to stop by the office first though. If I don't, the sheriff will kill me. They haven't had a graduation dance since 1945... because Major Chatham wouldn't allow it. Well, he'd stop it now if he could. But he can't. Since the stroke, no one's even seen him. You know, I feel sorry for him. He's all alone in that house, so close to where he found his daughter and that boy. State police called about an hour ago. Somebody robbed a market up near Columbus. Cut some kid up and took his car. They think he may be headed this way. Are you still going to leave? I can't start the summer without fishing. You know that. I never could. Besides, you've been here for two years now. You can handle anything that might come along. Here you go. You were so anxious to read it before. "Pam MacDonald. " I'm impressed. Thank you. Check, please. I guess with the, uh, sheriff leaving, you'll be on duty tonight, huh? Yeah. Oh. I was hoping maybe you could come by the graduation dance a little later. Well, maybe I can come by for a while. Mark? Hmm? You don't think the guy who robbed that store might come here, do you? I don't think so. State police will get him soon. Yeah, well, until they do, be careful. Okay? Hey, Pam. Over here. Hi, Carl. Hey. I read your article. Oh. Want to go make out on the point? I don't know. Is it worth the risk? Are you kidding? Did you taste the punch? It's kind of, uh, bland. It is now. But as soon as "el chaperono" isn't looking, we'll - Shh! Is the punch ready? Yes, Miss Allison. You're going to get us all in trouble. Well, Captain, if your men are after him, I don't think there's anything to worry about. Yeah, my deputy will let you know if he sees anything. Mark. Oh, yeah. Mm-hmm. He's a good boy. You're damn right it's my fishing trip. And if you bother me about anything, Bill, I'll kick your ass right across the state line, okay? Okay. Good-bye. Now, if you need anything, you got my number. The worst you'll probably have will be some of those kids from the dance running wild. Now, just remember, there's still some people around here who, uh, won't put up with that kind of thing. Yes, sir. You'll do fine. Come on down to Kingsley's with me. I've got some things I got to pick up. Oh, no. Major's orders, Ray. Otto, get out here! I'm- I'm right at the good part. Now, goddamn it, the major doesn't want to be kept waiting. All he does is wait... and watch some girls. Hey. Have you been sneaking around again? Now, I told you- Now get moving'. We got customers. Well, afternoon, George. Hi, Pat. - Hey, you leaving' today, huh? - Mm-hmm. Anything else for you today? Uh, yeah. Just some deodorant. No sweat. Get it? Hi, girls. Hi. Hey, you. Finished already? Yeah, we finally got that banner stretched out. What you doing', Deputy, guarding the store? Yeah. Going to be at the dance, won't you? I'll try. Try real hard. Hey, how you doing', girls? Now, what the hell you doing' still out here? I don't know, George. Sometimes I wonder why I've taken care of him so long. Well, I- I got to go tend to the customers. This time, uh, why don't you use those minnows for bait, huh? Bye, Pat. Are they graduating this year? Yeah. They're friends of Pam MacDonald. They don't seem like her type. Now, remember, if you have any problems, call me. Have a good time. I will. Hi. Hi. What do you think? This one? I like it. Or how about this one? I don't know what the difference is. I mean, with Carl around, it's not going to stay on too long anyway, right? Yeah. He is a real animal. Any of you Pritcher girls got any rolling papers? Uh, I think I do. Thank you very much. I'll roll you a couple for later. Carl gave them to me. Hey, you're not going to mope around tonight, are you? This is everybody's last night together. And some of us will never see each other again. Sherry. I'm worried about Mark. He'll come to the dance. I know. It's not that. It's- It's that guy who stabbed that man in Columbus. I thought you said they're about to catch him. Yeah, that's what Mark says. I wish the sheriff was here. Hey, Lisa. I just spilled nail polish all over your dress. Yeah, you do and I'll kill you. Lisa, you'd better close those shades. You're going to give old man Chatham another stroke. Are you kidding'? That old guy's harmless. He can't even get out of his wheelchair. Yeah, but there's nothing wrong with his eyes. He's been staring at us all semester. Oh, yeah? Lisa! Well, he ought to be able to stand up now. You're awful. Sherry. You want me to wait? I will if you hurry. No. That's okay. Carl gets real horny if I make him wait. Now who's the animal, huh? See you later. Bye. Do you always walk backwards? I thought I heard someone. I think you need this a whole lot more than I do. That's okay. Maybe it's that dangerous criminal you were telling' us about. Maybe he was trying to knock over Kingsley's. Lisa. Come on, you guys. Let's go. Jesus, Carl! You scared the shit out of me. Door was open. You know how I get when I have to wait around. Maybe I was expecting somebody else. Fat chance. Dont just stand there. Shut the door. Aren't you going to ask me in? How fast can you take off your clothes? Start your stopwatch, coach. Hurry up, Carl. I'm turning into a goddamn prune. I know well be together The cake's over here. I hope it's big enough for you. There. That should do. Come on, hot stuff. Let's go dance. There you go. You got a piece of that for me? Miss Al. You having' a good time? Hi. Hi. Oh. Okay. If you don't hurt yourself then you'll hurt someone else  Sure. Sometimes you learn things the hard way  Take the path of least resistance  Make it easy on yourself How you doing', honey cup? Hi, Paul. I know I can do the distance  It doesn't matter what they say  You know where you're going but you don't know what's there  Sometimes you learn things the hard way  So you take the high road  When the low road is faster Hi. Sometimes you do things the hard way  - Try not to hurry  - Well, Mr. Turner, what do you think? Oh, it's exciting. Just like the good old days. Except I had more hair then. Just take the path of least resistance  Make it easy on yourself Guess you've been around here longer than anyone. Yeah. Forty years. Good having the girls back. Makes me feel young again. Thanks for the dance. Aw, come on. I'm sorry. It's all right. Deputy, that was fun. Oh. Uh - Where you going'? I'm going back to the dorm to change. I'm sorry. Don't be. Okay? Don't be sorry. But when they find out what you've got  Hi, Lizzy. Sherry? It's only me, and I'm closing the door. Shit. Anne! Anne! Betty! Betty! Help! Help! No! Let go! Please! Stop it! No! No! Please let go! Mark! What's wrong? Oh, God. What happened? What happened? It's all right. What's the matter? Mark. Somebody was chasing me. Somebody was chasing me, and Major Chatham grabbed me. Major Chatham? Uh-huh. Mark, he hurt my arm. What the hell was Major Chatham doing down here? I don't know. And he - And he chased you? No. I don't know who chased me. All I saw was, um, boots and some kind of uniform. Are you okay? All right, I'm going to take a look around. My jeeps right there. Stay there. I'll be right back. Be right back. Did you find anything? I found wheelchair marks and boot tracks too. Did you look in the dorm? No. Here. Mark, Sherry's in there. Carl's with her. Okay. Let's go. Where? Major Chatham's. Major Chatham? Major Chatham! Let's try around back. Major Chatham! Major Chatham? Major Chatham! Major Chatham! Mark. This is Francis Chatham. I'm going to take a look upstairs. Major Chatham? Oh, Mark, you scared me. Everything's covered upstairs. Chatham probably hasn't even been up there since his last stroke. You find anything? Look at this. So what? It's the major's daughter. Francis Rosemary Chatham. They must have called her Rose. And look. See? I found a pressed rose in the yearbook. And the killer left behind a rose in her hands. Didn't you read my article? They never found out who did it. But it had to be someone in town, someone who knew that she was called Rose, and, Mark, that guy still might be around here. Oh, man. I don't believe this. You're talking about something that happened over 30 years ago. Pam. The guy who chased you may be the one the state police are looking for right now. I say let's get the hell out of here and go to the dance and see that everyone stays inside. Maybe you should call the sheriff. Thanks. I'm sorry. Okay. I didn't mean that. It's all right. Let's go. Paul, are you okay? Oh - God. I think I'm going to throw up again. Can't take this no more But I want to see blood on the floor Standing in the spotlight I hope I can see her bleed  I want to see her bleed  Don't turn off the spotlight I still want to see her bleed  Is Paul still in here? Yeah. He's sick as a dog. I'm going to go cool off, Paul. When you get tired of hugging the toilet, you can find me up at Garner's pool. I'm lonely and I want to go home alone  There she is. I'm lonely Don't leave me alone  You mean there was someone actually in the dorm? Are you sure you're all right? I'm fine. God. It must have been terrible. I want you to tell everyone to stay put. Right. I-I'll make an announcement right away. Very important announcement to make. Uh, is this thing on still? Do you think- Hello? Testing- Hello? Uh, attention. Could I have your attention, please, ladies and gentlemen? Uh, Deputy London has just informed me... that a prowler has been seen around the campus, and, uh- Well, he could be dangerous. Now, I know this won't be very popular, but I'm going to have to ask... that everybody please stay in the building until we know more about this. Which shouldn't be too long, okay? So everybody just relax and enjoy the dance and the music. Shit. Oh. Thank you. Oh. I'll probably puke in the damn pool. Psst! Hi. I'm back. Who turned off the band? Miss Allison just made an announcement. There's some kind of prowler outside or something. Maybe we should tell her Lisa left. Nah. Paul will be with her. She'll be okay. One, two, three! Hey, baby. Let's struggle. Come on. Wait a minute, Paul. You're going to have to wait a while before you go outside. For what? Paul, hold on. Just listen to me for a minute, okay? What the fuck's going' on here? Don't go  I don't give a shit about any goddamn prowler. All right. Now just settle down! Calm down, buddy. Leave me alone! Okay, okay. I want this boy arrested! We don't have to stand for this kind of thing here. I want him out of here! Or am I going to have to call the sheriff? Oh, God. This is stupid, man. All right, look. I'm getting' him out of here. Okay? Look. Can you handle everything here? Come on! Come on. She's where? Okay, I think that she went out to the pool, just to cool off. See, it was before the announcement. No, somebody's going to have to go get her. If you see Mr. Turner, just tell him where I've gone. Think I just got Lisa in trouble. Paul. Going to slap the cuffs on me, chief? Book them, Pam-o. Lisa? I am not going outside until they catch the prowler. That's it. We don't have to go- We don't have to go outside. There's a perfect place down in the basement. I know it. I mean, people here, they use it all the time for parties and stuff. Ha! Right! What kind of people? Come on, Sally. It's great. I'll show you. Come on. Come on. Am I okay? Yeah. Yeah? I thought you knew where this place was. Ah, that's the beauty of it. It's difficult to find. That way, there's no chance of being interrupted. Hang on. Hey. It's around here somewhere. Shit. Hey! Warden! We're busting' out of here at midnight! You can't keep me in here! What are you charging him with? Disturbing the peace. Hey, you can't keep me in here. My boys will spring me as soon as they hear about this. Hey! Keep it down in there! Ooh! Look out, boys! The marshal's coming' with his rubber hose! Paul, shut up! I heard something. It was probably just the wind. In the basement? Hmm? Basement! Why don't we check out the dorm again? You don't think he'd still be there, do you? It's all we have to go on. Oh, but Mark, what about Major Chatham? I'm not going to break into the man's house twice in one night. Well. Lookee here. Now, George left you in charge here. Can't you keep them kids under control? What are you doing here, Kingsley? It's that damn graduation thing. We haven't had any trouble out of that college for more than 30 years, and... now they have to start that damn thing over again. - What do you mean? - There's a bunch of kids over there in the cemetery. I know what they're doing' in there. Now, what are they doing in there, Kingsley? Hell, it was dark. I couldn't see anything. Well, if you couldn't see anything, why don't you just go home? Sure. But that gate was wide open. The gate's supposed to be locked at night. I wonder what he was doing wandering around down there. Watch the road. I'm going to see what I can find out there, okay? Okay. Mark! Mark! Mark! Mark. I saw somebody. I think it was Otto Hahn! I- H-He was looking at me through the window. I found an open grave out there. It's been opened. Oh, Lisa. No! No! - Ocoee Lodge. - Hello, yeah. Uh, could I please speak to Sheriff George Fraser? He should have checked in today. Well, I just come on an hour ago. Let me check and see what cabin he's in. Look, buddy. This is an emergency. I need to get in touch with him right away. He's in, uh... Lake Cabin Number 7. Most everybody's asleep now. Uh-huh. Well, why don't I just run out and get him? He isnt in his cabin. Well, do you know where he went? I told you. I just come on an hour ago. I ain't seen him. I know a bunch of them were going' night fishing for crappie up in, uh- Oh, shoot. Where were they going? Uh- Look, could you take a message? Yeah. I could take a message. Wait till I get a pencil. All right. Shoot. Yeah. Tell him to call Mark London. Tell him to get in touch with me right away. All right. I'll tell him. Bye. Mark? Mark, who are you calling? State police. Yeah. This is Deputy Mark London from Avalon Bay. Could I please speak to Captain Jenkins? Yeah, I'll hold. When will they be here? Less than half an hour. They caught the man who robbed the store three hours ago. He couldn't have killed Lisa. That was Rose Chatham's grave we found, wasn't it? I don't know. Mark, the same man who killed her killed Lisa. Why are we stopping here? I want you to go inside and see if everythings under control. All right? All right. I'll be right back. Pam? I want you to stay at the dance. What? I'm going up to Chatham's alone. Mark, that doesn't make any sense. I don't want to drag you around anymore, okay? Drag me around? What are you talking about? I'm sorry. All right. That's fine, Mark! You just go play sheriff, all right? Let's go. I'm going upstairs. Mark? Mark! What happened? I don't know! Must be the fuse. I'll go down and check it. No! No! I'm here for our date, Rose. No! No! No! No! No! No! Mark! Mark! Mark! No! No! Oh! No! No! Oh. No! Sheriff. Sheriff! Why? Why? Why? Go on upstairs. I better talk to this guy. No!
