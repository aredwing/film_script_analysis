Take it easy. There.. Do you hear something? - I heard some voices. -where? Arushi.. Come. what was that? Just calm down, Arushi. Please. Brother. - what happened? Brother. - what happened? what.. what happened? we.. we were in the forest.. -what? Somebody was chasing us and.. who was chasing you? we heard strange voices. - what? It was very confusing. It must be some animal. No, brother. No. It wasn't an animal. There was no animal. - Relax, Arushi. Relax. -There wasn't any animal, brother. Aarti. Destruction! Infliction! Imminent! Destruction! Aarti. Aarti. Aarti. Not Aarti, but Madhu! Mother. Raksha. You haven't changed as yet. I'll do it, mother. Don't bother me. ok, did you see my doll? Doll? No. Let's find it. I'll make them suffer. I'll make them suffer and kill all of them.. .. whom you love. Yes, Rajeev. - Vinay. Madhu has returned. which Madhu? - which Madhu! Madhu. Rajeev, you.. are you mad? Listen to me. - Madhu is dead. I just heard her. Maybe she's a ghost or something. I heard.. ...Aarti in Madhu's voice. Rajeev. Rajeev, how.. how is this possible? Vinay, I've no time. You.. listen to me. A gardener works at our place. Balu. He said he'll bring a exorcist from a nearby village.. .. but I don't trust him. You bring Manja here. ok, Rajeev. Rajeev, relax. Hurry up. Bring him quickly, Vinay. Look, I'll do something. ok? I'll bring Manja. Raksha. what happened, papa? what happened, Rajeev? Nothing. Papa, let's go on a drive. I'm getting bored here. Even this beach looks boring now. Yes, take them. we'll go tomorrow. Yeah! Rohan. Rohan, listen. I won't kill her so easily. Didn't I say that I'll make her suffer? You can't even escape, Rajeev. Because Aarti is with me. what did you say to Vinay? To Balu? Go. Do what you want to do. Bring whomever you want. Again and again you're thinking about.. -It's not so. It's not that I don't want to forget it. Ronnie.. .. I don't know.. .. what it was. Just forget it. It's no use thinking about it. I mean.. those voices.. That laughter. Those footsteps. Please forget all that. Please. And.. and just relax. ok? I like that car. Rajeev. -Yes, Vinay? That one. -That.. - Manja.. Manja is dead. - what? Yes, but.. - His head was.. He was beheaded. - what? Rajeev, there.. Are Raksha and Rohan fine? They're with me, friend. Listen, Rajeev. I've found a man. He can surely help us. I'll bring him there this evening. Look, Rajeev. Take care of Raksha and Rohan. Papa, what happened? Nothing. Papa, what happened? Nothing. Just an accident. -Accident? Get inside. Get in. Raksha, get in. So because they were corrupt.. .. you fired Madhu and her husband from the job. Yes. And when I found out that Madhu was.. .. doing black magic on my daughter.. .. we took witch-doctor Manja's help and.. .. he killed Madhu. It seems like everything was over, but now it feels.. .. that Madhu has returned as a ghost. But how? After dying where do people go? Nowhere. They're here around us. Nobody goes away from this world forever. They return as spirits or ghosts. Madhu's hatred towards you became an deep obsession. But she couldn't take revenge in her lifetime. So she has returned. And to take revenge from you she's using your wife's body. Now what? Now.. Can you bring Madhu's husband here? He must've some secrets of Madhu.. .. which can help me in confronting Madhu's spirit. Until then it can be dangerous for me to enter your house. I'll bring him. No matter where ever he is, I'll bring him. Rajeev, take care. I'll bring him. when her husband returns.. .. everything will be fine. Till then be careful. She's a ghost. And don't forget, your wife's body is in her control. Now go and until they return.. .. take care of your daughter. Hail peace! Hail peace! Madam, tea. Madam.. Madam. Madam. Hey, when did you come? Just now. - Give it to me. You can go. And marinate the chicken. -Yes. what happened? - Nothing. No. Listen to me Shyam. At any cost we.. .. at any cost we've to reach there with Anshuman. Yes. At any cost. I.. it will take.. around half an hour. oh no! Ronnie! Ronnie, somebody's here. what happened? Somebody's here. - Nobody's here. No, no, I... I just saw somebody out there. Just relax look at me. - Go to sleep. -I saw somebody. - There's nothing. Go to sleep. Come on, go to sleep. Rohan. My God! Yes, Vinay.
