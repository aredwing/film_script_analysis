We're trying to get the word out to|the community to brace themselves. We hope this thing's not gonna|develop into a real funnel... but after Saragosa, we're|not taking any chances. The National Weather Service says|the storm is moving northeast... and with the exception of some rain, it|shouldn't affect the Dallas-Fort Worth area. That's news, sports and weather. I'm|Frank Castle for KGAB talk radio news. From the heart of|the Lone Star state, it's time for Dallas'|most popular talk show, Night Talk|with Barry Champlaign. # Bad to the bone # The KGAB phone lines are open|and ready for your call... at 555-TALK. And now your host for Night|Talk, Barry Champlaign. - The worst news|of the night is that... three of four people say they'd rather|watch TV than have sex with their spouse. The second worst news is that some|kids needed money for crack last night, so they stuck a knife in the throat|of an 80-year-old grandmother... down on Euclid Avenue|right here in Dallas. One night|in one American city. Multiply that by hundreds of|cities and what have you got? A country where culture means|pornography and slasher films,; where ethics means payoffs,|graft, insider trading,; where integrity means Iying,|whoring and intoxication. This country is|in deep trouble, people. This country is rotten to the core and|somebody better do something about it. Take your hand out of that bowl of|Fritos, throw away your National Enquirer, and pick up the phone,|hold it up to your face... and dial 555-TALK. Open your mouth and tell me what we're|gonna do about the mess this country's in. Talk radio- it's the last|neighborhood in town. People don't talk|to each other anymore. Let's go to|the first caller. A lot of problems with the|country today have a lot do... - with the continued exploitation|of the third world countries. Wait. Third world countries? Where'd|you learn that phrase, in college? Do you know what it means?|You're getting off the track. We're not getting off the track,|we're getting on. Josh, go back to college. When|you graduate, give me a call. A prime example of that|uniquely American institution; the concerned|bleeding-heart liberal... looking for people with|problems he can call his own. Francine in Oakline.|I'm a transvestite. I'm trying to save money|for an operation... What interest do you think your adventures|in surgery hold for my listeners? It's something I have to talk|about. I don't. Night Talk. Let me put you on hold. You slip|some testosterone into Barry's coffee? The guy's possessed tonight.|He's a little tense. Get outta here! Sometimes I come home from work and|we have dinner together, you know? No, I don't know. You have|dinner at the table with your cat? With a tablecloth and|candles? No, Barry. Just her own plate on the floor. Good. But we eat the same things. Like if I|have a pork chop, she has a pork chop. If I have a veal,|she has a veal. Glenn, take my advice. Stop hangin' around with|the pussy. Go find some. I'm listening, Michael.|What's up? Yeah, I heard your little|advertisement there for the pizza place. Yeah, Jericho's Pizza. I love|that pizza. Don't you like it? You sound like you'd love|it. I enjoy Jericho's Pizza. What I wanted to say to you|tonight, Mr. Champlaign, was... I have an interest in this place,|or at least, some friends of mine... Just use one-syllables, Billy,|if it's difficult. Oh, Michael. Hey, smart guy.|Just use one-syllable... Smart guy?|We're being- Smart guy. We got somebody with|a little lip on us tonight. Hey.|Don't call me "Hey." This is not a conversation. This|is a monologue. I talk, you listen. Understand me?|Oh, yeah, we're listening. Yes? Go ahead. I don't want you makin' any more|comments about the pizza joint. Do you have relatives that run the|place? People gotta make money on this. Uncle Vinnie or someone?|There are people... You know what, Michael?|You're a meatball. - Debbie in Highland Park.|- My name is Debbie. Hello, Debbie.|How old are you? I'm 23.|Uh-huh. What do you do?|I don't do anything. When was the last time|you did something? I don't know.|About a month ago. What'd you do a month ago?|I went swimmin'! Mm-hmm.|What do you do for money? I got my brother.|I haven't made any. Debbie, you're a leech. Don't you think it's time you got|off your duff, started making money? Well, not really.|I got everything I want. But, Debbie, what do you need? Well... What are you missing that|you need? A guy. A boyfriend. A guy? What do you have|to offer a guy? Well... I have nice,|shiny long hair... A guy could buy|himself a wig. You can tell I don't have a wig.|It never falls off. You're terrific, darling.|But seriously, Debbie. Aren't you shooting for anything more|in life than looking for a free meal? Not really. You wanna lie around till you|find somebody to take care of you. Yeah.|You're dynamic, darling. Rhonda from Garland on the line.|Rhonda, you're on Night Talk. Barry, I want to|express my views... What are you doing, Steve?|Looking at this Dietz guy. ...up in New York City, givin'|out needles to drug addicts. They have to do it to stop|AIDS. Clean needles help. It's immoral for the|government of this country... tax dollars to be|goin' to addicts. But it's all right for our tax|dollars, four billion of them, to go into a system|that's a complete joke. More drugs than ever|are coming into this country. Our courts, our jails|are clogged with cases. The other night up in New York City,|crack dealers killed another cop. Any kid who wants a hit|can get one. That's right. When are we gonna|wake up, Rhonda? When are we going to admit that drug|prohibition is not working in this country? I think-|Know what I think? I think we should legalize all|drugs, as sinister as that sounds. That's the dumbest thing|I ever heard. Is it? A junkie could go to a|drugstore, More stuff, Laura. sign his name,|get the stuff for a buck... then he doesn't have to rob or|kill for his habit. Thanks, Ellen. You cannot let children|have drugs. Why not? They're gonna|get it anyway. Why not? In America today we're talking about|shooting up in the eighth grade. We have a moral obligation|to the children. Know what the most|dangerous drug is? It's heroin.|No, it's legal. It's tobacco.|It kills 350, 000 people a year. You know how much coke, crack,|heroin, pot kill every year? Four thousand people. Will you|listen to sense? Hello? Let me check. Will you listen to logic,|please? The only people who benefit|from prohibition... are the gangsters|makin' the money on it, the politicians condemning|it and gettin' your vote. And who foots the bill?|You, Rhonda Q Sucker! I beg your pardon!|It would end tomorrow. The $200 billion drug problem in this|country could disappear overnight. Legalize the damn stuff. Do it|today, right after this message. I'm Barry Champlaign.|This is Night Talk. We're gonna go to a message. I'll|be right back after I shoot up. Who's the schlub? Barry, Dan and I wanted to tell you|before the show we have some good news. Barry? Dan, I can't talk|right now. I gotta take a leak. I'll catch you later,|okay? Stu, cool it with the baseball calls|and the transvestites. How's the lines? I got five hanging on|already. Give me 45. You got it. Barry, I'd like|you to meet Chuck Dietz, V.P. in charge of advertising,|Metro Wave, Chicago. Really? Very nice to meet|you. It's my pleasure. I've been reading all|your press clippings... and listening to tapes|of your shows for weeks. And?|And you're really something. You're very funny.|I try to amuse. I'm in the middle of a show. I've|gotta move it along. Genius at work. Metro Wave's picking up the show starting|Monday, linking it to a national feed. Some people at Humphrey's Coffee|want to sponsor the show nationally. We're at cold; 30, Bar. Wait a minute. The show's going|national starting Monday night? When did this happen? - Don't I get a say in this? You know about this?|- Yeah. Dan|- We didn't know anything about it until tonight. No sense getting you all|excited until it panned out. Chuck is here to be the eyes and|ears of Metro Wave, so to speak. So to speak.|Fifteen, Bar. Why don't you go ahead.|We can talk later. We got a hot show. We're talking Larry King here|- coast to coast. It's always a hot show,|Dan. Stu, find me a catheter. Extra hot. We'll get a|contract for six months. Jawohl. You're listening|to the best talk in Texas. Barry Champlaign on KGAB.|You know about this? Yeah. Chill, will you, Barry?|The bucks don't suck. Stand by. 555-TALK.|Yo. Metro Wave Broadcasting|is a giant media corporation... specializing|in broadcast radio. It has 357|affiliate stations... in the United States|and Canada. Two minutes ago|I received a phone call... from the man who controls|those 357 stations... the president of|Metro Wave Broadcasting. He asked me if Metro Wave|could pick up this show, pick up Barry Champlaign for national|syndication, beginning Monday night. I've had|these offers before, and I've been asked in the past|if I could ever soften my touch, go a little easier, and my|answer has always been the same; Take it or leave it. He took it. And so,|beginning Monday night, this show, Night Talk,|begins national broadcasting. That means the nation|is listening. You better have something|to say. I know I do. And we have Chet from Mesquite|on the line. Hello, Chet.|Hello? You think you're so smart.|Hello? Why are you always talkin'|about the drugs and niggers... and homos and Jews? Isn't there anything else to|talk about? You know what I hate? I hate people who tell me what|they don't wanna talk about. You don't wanna talk about blacks|and gays, why'd you bring them up? Sounds like you like|talking about them. Tell me what you wanna talk|about, or get off the phone. Why don't you start telling|the truth? About what? You know. People behind your|show, people who pay the bills. Talking about the sponsors|now. Don't you act dumb with me. What kind of a name|is Champlaign? I want you to cancel my plane|reservations for tonight. You changed it? I'm gonna come in tomorrow. Maybe|because it sounded too Jewish. Call Freddie. Tell him to call me|tomorrow. Change the name, get a nose job, same old story.|Chet, come on! He started out a bit shaky. Your|attitude reminds me of a story. Last summer|I visited Germany. Wanted to take a look|at Hitler's homeland. Are you familiar|with Adolf Hitler, Chet? I'm familiar|with Adolf Hitler. I bet you are. I decided to visit the remains of a|concentration camp on the outskirts of Munich: Dachau. You join a tour group, go out by bus,|get out at the gate. It's chilling. A sign over the gate says,|"Arbeit Macht Frei. " It means, "Work will make you free"|- something the Nazis told their prisoners. You still listening to me,|Chet? I'm counting your lies. Good. I wanna make sure|you're hearing them. I'm walking around this concentration|camp, and I see something on the ground. I picked it up.|Guess what I found, Chet? A tiny Star of David.|Very old. Who knows? It might've belonged to|one of the prisoners at the camp. Maybe a small boy|torn from his parents... as they were dragged off|to the slaughterhouse. I kept that Star of David. I know I shouldn't have, but I did.|I keep it right here on my console. I like to hold it|sometimes. In fact, well...|I'm holding it right now. I like to hold it in my hand|to give me courage. Maybe some of the courage that small|boy had as he faced unspeakable evil... can enter me as I face|the trials in my own life... as I face the cowardly|and the narrow-minded. The bitter, bigoted people who|hide behind anonymous phone calls... full of hatred|and poisonous bile. The gutless,|spineless people... like you, Chet,|who make me puke! Keep talkin', Jewboy.|Life is short. Stu, let's send|a microwave oven out to Chet. And we have Kent on the line.|Yeah, Kent? I need help.|Shoot. I like to party|with my girlfriend. How old are you?|Nineteen. How old's your girlfriend?|Seventeen. Okay, go ahead. So we|like to party, you know? When you're partying, where|are your parents? On a vacation. He's so excited about it.|Look at him. I think it's Fiji.|Is that right? Is there a place called Fiji? Excuse|me. I'm gonna take care of some stuff. Your parents are on vacation in a|place called Fiji, and you're partying. Yeah, that's what I wanted|to ask you about, Bar. See, we've been partying|for a couple of days. Uh-huh. Smokin' coke, crack. Free-base. Sounds pretty sordid, Kent. You've|been smoking crack with your girlfriend. What else you been up to?|Drinkin'. Mm-hmm.|I don't know. I drank a bottle of 100-proof whiskey|yesterday 'cause I was gettin' paranoid. Jill was doin' some acid|with some Valium. It was... Kent, you need to call a|doctor, have your stomach pumped. Let me give you a number to|call. That's why I'm callin' you. Why?|It's Jill. She's been sleepin' a long time|- No, no, no. She's been sleepin'|and she won't wake up. Don't waste my time with this baloney.|When you get outta detox, give me a call. She's turnin' blue.|She's turning blue? Great. Just give Stu your address|and we'll send an ambulance there now. Give Stu your address, we'll|send an ambulance in two minutes. I can't! I can't! I'm gonna|get your address. Kent, hello? Hello? I'm really glad people like Kent|are out there and I'm inside here. We're gonna go to|a little commercial break now. Whoo-whee! Jericho's Pizza, down|Route 111 at the Jericho Turnpike. They got pizza you'll never forget. One|slice, you don't have to eat for a week. I saw a guy in there combing his hair with|his stuff off the plate. Jericho's Pizza. We have the news and weather coming up,|then we'll be back with more Night Talk. Here's your mail.|You read it. What's the problem tonight?|Fight with the old lady? No, there's no problems.|Throwing me some real curve balls. What's wrong with curve|balls, Bar? Some call. It's a hoax.|How can you be sure? A hoax. Stu, who's this|Henry? You didn't give me this. Who's Denise from Fort|Worth? I didn't get that. - Maybe Laura should take the calls.|- These people were stiffs. You want stiffs, I'll|give you stiffs. No, Stu. I don't want stiffs. Am I|speaking English? Read my lips. Keep the show moving,|give me stuff I can work with. You having trouble understanding|me? No, I'm not having trouble. As a matter of fact,|I read you loud and clear. Good! Barry? Barry. Honey, just relax.|Everything's under control. It's my ass on the line,|not yours. All you have to do|is just be nice. Okay?|Just for tonight. You be nice, Laura.|It's what you're good at. You're not gonna lose|even with a 15... Jerry, I'm gonna put you on|hold. Something wrong, Barry? I can't work with him breathing|down my neck. I want him out now! I have your contract right here. Why|don't you take it and look it over. You dump it on me the Friday|before it's gonna happen. You stick some putz|in the middle of my studio. I feel like I'm auditioning|for my own job! Barry, calm down.|You don't care. Just stick me out there,|see how it goes. Doesn't work out, flush Barry|down the toilet, right? You're not gonna get me to apologize|for getting you a slot on national radio. I worked very hard on this deal,|and I'm happy with it. If you're not,|we tear up the contract, we don't do|the Metro Wave hookup. Big mistake, guy. I think it's worth the|gamble because I think the show is good. Barry, you are good. And it will|blow them away everywhere it's heard. Dietz goes with the deal.|Grin and bear it. You do your job,|I'll do mine. Did you run Sani Clean|before the news? Yes, I did.|You up with your log? There's a Harry's, a Firestone,|a logo. They're all on track. Good. Don't let it get to|you. It's been a strange night. There's nothing strange about it.|How long you been working here? Four months. How long you|been sleeping with him? Listen, Ellen.|I was gonna cheer you up. Metro Wave, the network, is picking|up the show. We're going national. Oh, my God. In Chicago|too? Yeah, in Chicago too. It's not that simple-|You must be so excited! Yeah, of course|I'm excited. We got this character here from|the company keeping an eye on me. I'll be right off the phone. Ellen,|will you tell him you're talking to me? I like this stuff. Nights like|tonight are what it's all about. You either get used to it|or you get lost. That's what his wife did|- left him. So did the two producers who were here before you. But big Stu stayed,|didn't he? I don't have to take his shit. I'm|not his wife. You're not, but I am. This is not the best time|forme to talk. Yeah, yeah.|I'm sorry I'm calling so late. It's just that This is|important. Barry, 20! I need your help with something.|I never ask you for anything and... Barry... Can you come to Dallas|over the weekend, till Tuesday? What? I need someone|here I can trust. It's... - It's important.|- Damn it! Come on! I don't think he's|gonna let me. Forget it. Forget it.|Don't come. He answered,|"The night he didn't come home. " No, that happened all the time.|Ellen? I'm thinking, okay? Five, Bar. Allright. Sunday? You pick me|up at the airport. Strap in, Bar. Yeah, I'll be there.|Here we go. - Look, I gotta go. Bye.|- You're listening to the best talk in Texas. The phone lines are open, and|your calls are invited now... at 555-TALK. Bob, what a relief.|How you doing tonight? Terrific.|Very well, thank you. I hope you're not gonna get|too busy to take my calls. No show is complete without|your call. How are the legs? They're fine|- an ache or two. But you know what I say? When they give you lemons,|make lemonade. You can't cry over spilled|milk. Cry, and you cry alone. You can't lose|what you never had. Because you don't know|what you got until you lost it. So don't lose hope.|This too shall pass. Because today is the first day|of the rest of your life. Yeah, and it's always darkest|before dawn. Bob, could I just... People think that life in a wheelchair|must be the worst thing in the world. That's not the way|I look at it. I imagine the worst thing|in the world would be... bein' unthankful for all the good|things that come our way everyday. The smiles on little children,|flowers bloomin', little birds chirpin', sittin' on the|buddin' branches on a bright spring day. Why, hell, just the sun comin'|up every day is a miracle. I couldn't agree with you more,|especially that part about the sun. We get bogged down in our daily troubles|and we forget about the simple things. Oh, I forgot one more thing|to be thankful for. What's that?|The Barry Champlaign show. Thank you, Bob.|Listen, we gotta run. Know you can't, but we can. So God bless you|- One more thing. Don't put all your eggs in one|basket. A bird in the hand... - Good night. And we have-|- Debbie, you still there? - Turn your radio down. Stop crying.|- Well, I'm black. Good for you.|What do you want? A medal? Well, no, I don't. Don't play|with me like them other people. I want you to know... that I enjoy listening to your show,|and I want to say, I like you Jews. Well, I like you blacks.|I think everyone should own one. What I mean to say is, Uh-huh. I have many|friends who are Jewish. Really? How many?|Well, three or four. I wouldn't call that "many."|They're very nice people. They're educated|and they're good in business. John, I don't know how to break this to you,|but you'll never get in the B'nai B'rith. You're black. Don't you know|how Jews feel about blacks? They hate you! They see you schwartzes on|the street, they cross to the other side. You know those slums in south Dallas|where the rats eat babies for breakfast? Jews own those slums! What do you mean, I|love Jews? Are you some kind of Uncle Tom? What the hell you know about|Uncle Tom? I think brotherhood... I don't care what you think!|No one does! You wanna know why? Because you're|trying to kiss the master's butt. What? You call me up, try to get|deep on how much you love Jews. You're Iying. You hate them.|You hate me! I don't kiss nobody's butt!|Sure you do! You kiss my butt. You're kissing my butt right now.|If you weren't, you'd hang up on me. I don't wanna hang up on you!|Then I'll do you the favor. - Night Talk.|Debbie, you're on. Barry?|Mm-hmm. This is Debbie again. Oh, Debbie. Right. She of the long hair,|my zombie queen, my fantasy. How are you, my belle?|Bad. I've been thinkin' about|what you said. I wanna ask you somethin'.|Yeah? What's wrong with me?|What? Chet's back. You've had Debbie on twice.|I don't think you should take the call. Barry? I can handle|it. Just shoot it to me. This is too important. I'm not gonna jump|through hoops tonight just because of this... Please,|tell him to put it on. Yeah, Debbie, look,|you should see the shape I'm in. I mean, nothing a good plastic surgeon|or a glass of cyanide wouldn't fix. I mean, you're young. You got|your whole life ahead of you. Why don't I go anywhere? Well, you gotta|stand up first. I mean, every journey|begins with a single step. You gotta go for it,|pumpkin. Me and Linda used to go out,|but she moved to Houston. Yeah- Heh!|Listen, Debbie, Debbie. You got two arms and two legs? Yeah. Are you blind?|No. You got a belly button?|Yeah. Two belly buttons?|No, I got one. Are you sure?|Have you looked lately? Yeah. I got one.|You're gonna be fine. You're gonna be just fine. And we have... Chet from|Mesquite on the line. Chet? So now everyone in the country|can hear your big mouth flap. Chet, so nice|to hear from you again. Shouldn't you be out burning|crosses or molesting children? I'd rather be talking to you.|How about training pit bulls? Think you're so smart. You get the package|I sent down to the station? Package? You got it, I know you did.|You sent me a present? I couldn't decide whether|to use a timer or not. You'll have to find that out|when you open it. You're telling me|you sent me a bomb in the mail? Wrapped in brown paper. I know|you're lookin' at it right now. You just take some C-4, roll it in a pile of nuts and bolts|and pebbles, and it does the job. Sounds interesting, Chet.|I didn't receive your package. Sure you sent it to the|right address? You got it. If I were you, I'd have my pretty|assistant give the police a call. Take the bomb squad|ten minutes to get there. Why should I call|the bomb squad, Chet? Because some pinheaded redneck moron|tells me there's a bomb in my mail? He who laughs last... Shut up! Night Talk.|Denise, you're on. I'm scared, Barry. What|are you scared of, babe? Nothin' specifically,|but on the other hand... it's like everywhere I go... Mm-hmm. Yeah? Barry, you know,|we've got... a garbage disposal in our|kitchen sink. Yeah, it's fine. Tell Dan my mail|is my business. This is not funny. You tell|Dan my mail is my business. You know how that feels when you have|to reach down there into that gook... and put your hand around? Who knows what|could be down there? Dan, I hope you're not calling the cops.|If you are, I'm gonna get really pissed off. Get off the phone|or I walk. There's germs you can't even|see. Don't waste my time, man. Hang it or I walk!|They grow there. Hang it up! They come back up the pipes. - Salmonella, yeast, cancer, even|the common cold. Who knows? But, Barry, even without|all of that, what if... and I'm just sayin'|what if... what if that disposal came on|while your hand was down there? And it goes around and around|- Denise, tell me something. You're telling me that you're afraid of the|garbage disposal in your mother's kitchen? Well, it's not just|the garbage disposal. I like things|to be clean, Barry. How often does|this happen? Couple times since|I've been here. Like the houses on our street. Used|to be we knew who lived on our street. But that was years ago. Now all|different kinds of people live here... foreigners,|people with accents. Are they sanitary? Why|don't you ask one of them? That would be a nice idea to|just go to somebody's house... and knock on their door, but what if a serial murderer|lived there? What if Ted Bundy|lived there? What if he was sittin' inside watchin'|television, and I came to the door? "Why, you just come right on|in here, Denise, " he'd say. That's why I don't go to|strange people's houses anymore. I keep the doors locked at all times,|but that's not gonna solve anything. You're not gonna stop a plane from|crashin' onto your house, are you? No. The mailman brings|me unsolicited mail. The postage stamp could've been|licked by somebody with AIDS. My mother's a threat to my life|just by persistin' to go out there. - Out where? Where does your mother go?|- Barry... Barry, did you know there's this|terrible dust storm in California? It has these fungus spores|in it, and these spores... get into people's lungs|and their bloodstream... and it grows,|and then it kills them. Strange air.|Strange air, Barry. Oh, I hear my mother's key|in the door. Strange air.|Well, uh... That about wraps up another thrilling|episode with the man you love to love. Gotta go home now,|take care of the goldfish. Stay tuned, 'cause Monday's when|Night Talk begins national syndication, allowing the good folks of Dallas|to have verbal intercourse... with the rest of the U.S.A. But don't go away yet. If you've got any psychological|problems or you're just plain suicidal, Dr. Sheila Fleming is here, and she'll|be glad to give you some dubious advice. Or if you're just a level headed, happy,|normal person, you can turn the radio off. Until Monday, this is Barry|Champlaign reminding you that... sticks and stones can break your|bones, but words cause permanent damage. # Bad to the bone|B- B-B-B-Bad # It's time to strap him up and wheel|him away for his weekend therapy. But Barry Champlaign will be back|with more Night Talk Monday... on KGAB, Dallas. Barry, my man.|What's happenin'? The coach is here. You're gonna say|a few words and then give him the cup, and then he's gonna talk. Yeah. Now, you're gonna be|introduced by Mel in the booth. Got it.|You hear the show last night? A great show.|Great show. Listen, I never got that autographed|picture that you promised... so I can hang it|in my restaurant. You were supposed to send it over|three weeks ago. It slipped my mind. Slipped your mind? What mind? What|could be more important than that Dino? I'll send it over first thing|tomorrow. Don't go to any trouble. No trouble.|Where is he? There he is. Stick around. You are the|greatest, Barry! All right. See you.|See you later. He's a great guy, huh? Of course he is. He thinks you're God.|What bit you in the ass? You're pissed' cause I tell you to get|a picture for the guy, which is your job. I'm pissed because you haven't said two|words to me all week except to boss me around. We work together. That's the deal.|I'm the boss. I boss you around. It's more than that. It's like you're|always angry with me. Excuse me. You're Barry Champlaign,|aren't you? Yeah. Can I have an autograph?|Thanks. Sure thing. Hi.|Hi. Here you go.|Thanks a lot. I love your show. Okay, see you later. Back in the cage. I used to listen to your show|when I was in high school. I'm supposed to be doing my homework, and|- Barry? You wanna make it out|to Joe Bob, please? Sure. You should have called. I would|have come and tucked you in. Thanks, Barry.|God bless. God bless you,|Joe Bob. The show going national is|important. Let's work together. Just be a little more careful|around this guy Dietz. This is a big thing,|Barry. Right. I'm not greasing|my way up a pole. I resent it that when I talk to|you like your producer... All right. you treat me|like a girlfriend, and when I talk to you like your|girlfriend, you treat me like your wife. I'm not following the drift|of this conversation. We work together, we|sleep together. That's it. I didn't know when we started seeing each|other I was enrolling in a self-help course. If I'm angry,|that's who I am. For better or for worse, that's|what got me where I am today. If you think it's tough on the outside,|just be thankful you weren't born me. I've gotta be out of my mind|picking a fight with you. You a little moody today?|Is that the problem? Excuse me. Are you|Mr. Barry Champlaign? Uh, maybe. Could I have your autograph? Sure, sure. You do a great job|on the show. I couldn't do it without you. Thank you. I listen to your show|all the time. I think you're a sick,|foul-mouthed, disgusting man, and you make people really|nauseous 365 days a year. It just goes to show what masochists|people are, they listen 365 days a year. I don't know why they leave your|show on the air. Let's get outta here. Everybody I know hates it. It|makes me wanna throw my radio out. Let's go. If you don't like|the show, why do you listen? 'Cause I'm waitin' for a better|program that's on later. Waiting for another program? There|are 30 other shows on in Dallas. You listen to my show|every night. Makes sense. I feel real sorry for you, and I think|you should be ashamed of yourself. - You're such a pathetic nerd.|- I should be ashamed? At least I don't show up in public, half in|the bag, making an utter jerk out of myself. You have no credibility. You|like what I do. You need me. But you have no sense of humor, which|is why you can never enjoy the show, which is why you're a loser, like|all people who have no sense of humor. And you are categorically|one of them. Good-bye. - Furthermore- - Lady, what|the hell is the matter with you? What'd you do? What|happened to your suit? Jesus. All right,|you're gonna be fine. Come on. Let's go. All of us are here for something very|important and exciting at S.M. U., and I think you know|what I'm talking about. Who's ready for a new beginning?|How about Mustang football this fall? That's what I thought. Now|- Now, to introduce the new man in charge of football here at S.M.U., our own KGAB radio personality-|the man you love to love... ladies and gentlemen,|Mr. Barry Champlaign! Thank you. On my way|over here tonight, I... I was finding out that... They love me.|They really love me. Ladies and gentlemen,|let's calm down. A different kind of welcome|than I've ever experienced. Barry? Barry! Barry. Hello? Laura, it's Dan. Is Barry there? Hang on a second. It's Dan.|Hmm? Did I wake you up?|I'm sorry. No, I always get up ten hours|before I have to go to work. It's Sunday, your day off|from self-loathing. You said you didn't want Dietz breathing|down your neck, so we had a drink. He's a sharp guy. Loves you, loves the show.|You should sit down with him, have a chat. Is he gonna give|you orders now? I figured you'd look at it that way,|so I set up a meeting for Sunday brunch. What? He's got some great ideas, Bar. The guy wouldn't know an idea|if it crawled on his kneecap. Just hold your horses|for one minute. Chuck and I decided before we hit national|air we should establish a few ground rules. Ground rules? What is this, Dan?|A radio station or an airport? Will you shut the fuck up and|listen? No, I won't listen to you. I knew that when that corporate cannibal|came into my studio I was in trouble. What difference does it make|to you? It's just a show, right? Are you saying I don't care? Nobody cares|more than I do. I don't wanna hear it. I'm gonna come in tomorrow night, I'm|gonna do the same show I do every night. And blow the deal.|If it means that, yes. I do my show, or I don't|do a show. Good-bye. You f... I gotta take a piss. Hello?|Is Barry there? Who's calling, please? Look, I'm|in a rush. Could you just get Barry? Barry, phone again!|It's a woman! Get her number. I'll call|her back. He'll call you back. It's a pay phone. I can't|call you back. Who is this? Look, just tell Barry|it's his ex-wife. Huh! It's a pay phone. She can't you|call back. It's your ex-wife. Shit. Give me that. Ellen, hi. I'm|down at the airport. Remember? What airport? Dallas. What|do you think? It's Sunday. You told me to be here.|Uh, well, great. Are you too busy,|or are you coming to get me? Yeah. No, I'm not busy.|I'm just doing some work here. Who answered the phone? I|thought you said you were alone. It's just my secretary. Look,|Ellen, what airline are you on? American Airlines.|Maybe I should just leave. No, you stay there. I'll|see you in 20 minutes, okay? You better be here. Yeah,|I'll see you in 20 minutes. Are you allright? I'm fine.|I'll see you in 20 minutes. Okay. See ya. Bye. I gotta get her now. Where are my shoes? What?|Don't give me that look. Hey. Hey, come here. She wants to|be here for the national show. What am I supposed to do?|Say no? Huh? What did Dan want? Wants me to come in|and kiss Dietz's ass. I told him|to kiss my microphone. Look, uh... Can you clean up around here|a bit before you go? Huh? Where's my shoes? I'll call you later,|okay? You look nice.|Thanks. You look great.|You look good too. Except for my wrinkled clothes. Except for|- I miss you, so what? So what have you been doing? I hate when|you call me in the middle of the night. Lou is so pissed off at me,|I had a fight. I had a fight at the end of this|with Lou. You're too good for Lou. Don't start, Barry.|Barry, don't start. You been going to a health|club? You're such a jerk. Excuse me? You been going to|a health club or something? Why?|You look dynamite. I left you. I look|dynamite 'cause I left you. Jesus. I spend time,|a little, on my own self. I'm working too. I'm not|at someone's beck and call. Ellen this, Ellen that.|I want this, I want that. I may not have worked for you|- You just have to bring him food. Is that basically it? Don't start. "Bring me|another plate of spaghetti. " You're such|a troublemaker. Why doesn't he go to the health|club? Probably can't fit in the door. He does. Barry! Hey, I have no bad feelings|about Lou. I'm glad he's so lucky. You know, I'm glad that somebody's|treating you nice for a change. I have some time for myself.|It's kinda, you know, it's... When I was with you, I spent|so much time taking care of you, and Lou sometimes|even takes care of me. Um... I don't know.|It's a different lifestyle. You're like a carnival, and he's more like|homogenized milk. Why are you staring at me? I miss you. I miss you too. What's this hold|you have on me? Love. I'm sorry. I'm not supposed to|say stuff like that. I forgot. Barry, what do you want me to|do? Fall in love with you again? Is that what this is about? I|don't want you doing anything. I mean, you're here. That's all I|- I'm happy that you're here. I- I don't know- I have to|go at the end of the day... or tomorrow... and I can't keep coming|back and forth. I- You know,|you've got success. You know, the most important thing is,|you've got to start loving yourself. You got that. You are good.|You are wonderful. Now, feel it and know|you have to have a life. Find someone with a soul. Mm-hmm. Don't just fall in love|with some girl's body. I mean, you do like a|girl's body, didn't you? The only problem was I got|caught. Yeah, what can you do? Maybe you should've stayed|at your mom's that day. Tony, keep the taper nice|and tight around the waist. Judge wants to look hot|for his old lady. Don't you think these lapels are|too much for an awards ceremony? Judge, everyone's gonna be wearing|these lapels by this time next year. Wait and see. You need|a shirt to go with that. What do you think about|that referendum coming up? I was gonna ask you the|same question. Perfect. Throwin' this in free of charge. Gift|from me and Teddy. Very kind of you. Judge, you bring out the|woman in me. You're gorgeous. Hey, good-looking. Tony, why don't you show the|judge back to the dressing rooms. I'll just take this|up for you. Thank you. Been out shopping? Buy any|see-through undies? Uh-huh. I thought we'd have|lunch together. Love to, babe.|Having lunch with the judge. He's gonna help me out with that|zoning variance for the nightclub. Okay, work's important.|What about dinner? I can't.|Moe Thompson's stag party. City Council president.|Come on. Make sure there are no women. Hey. Tomorrow night, you and me, dinner,|just the two of us. The Caprice? Promise? Flowers? Mariachi|bands? I promise. Tablecloths. Barry.|Music. What, Vince? Someone you gotta meet. Guess who|this is. Go ahead, guess. What, Vince? I have no idea.|Your Cousin Al. No. What a joker.|Jeff, say something. What is this, performing seal|time? Cut another caller off. You're history. Ptt!|You're on Talk of the Town. You're Jeff Fisher. In my store. I can't believe it.|I listen to your show all the time. You're great, man. You look|different than I thought. You thought I'd be 6'2", in spurs? Yeah. This is my wife, Ellen.|Nice to meet you. - Yeah, the craziest people|call in that show. I think of calling|myself sometimes. You're too shy, right?|I can tell. Don't I listen all the|time? He thinks you're God. Thank you, sir. Wish we had|your picture. We could put it up. I'll send you one.|You've got quite a voice. Voice?|You ever do radio? I've thought of doing some|radio. Only came in for a second. I gotta run. Listen, Vince,|send the jacket to my home. - Uh- Uh- What's your name?|- Barry. Barry Golden. Yeah. Anytime you're in the|neighborhood, stop by the station. Love to show you around, let you|say a couple of words, Yeah, sure. sell some suits,|plug the store. My secretary'll send the picture. Don't|forget the sleeves. Nice meeting you. Bye-bye!|Bye! The topic is|fantasy love affairs. Who would you like to have|a love affair with? We're here with our good friend,|Barry. What's your name this week? Barry Champlaign, man. Barry|Champlaign, man, is here, and he has said "his wife." Mm-hmm. These are supposed to be|famous people, unless your wife's gotten around|a lot more than I think she has. Come on. Your wife's|not listening, okay? Who would you really like to|get up close and personal with? Marie Osmond, I think, is very|sexy. That's one for Marie Osmond. In black leather, yeah.|The studio fish is blushing. She is sex incarnate, man.|She's a Mormon, isn't she? Mormons believe in bigamy. Marie,|I want to marry you right now. Come down to the station.|I want you, Marie. Okay! We'll take another caller.|Yeah, you're on Talk of the Town. Yeah, you know what I think? You|two are a couple of liberal pinkos. That's what I think. Are you|two homos? Is that what you are? You know what you are,|my friend, you are history. Wait.|The caller has a point. It's true, sir, indeed,|Jeff Fisher and I are lovers. Have been for the last 15 years. In|fact, we're holding hands right now. Probably nigger lovers too.|Yeah, what race are you, sir? I'm white,|and I'm proud of it. As one white man to another,|let me ask you a question. Do you know how much white Americans|spend every year on suntan lotion? $165 million! That's a lot of money to spend|just to turn brown. You know why they wanna turn|brown? Jeff, do you know why? Let's take another caller.|This is an interesting question. They wanna turn brown because|they secretly want to be black. You know why they wanna be black?|These and other questions... Because they feel|sexually inferior. You're a smart-mouth homo.|That's what you are. Okay, okay.|You're an inbred throwback... Ha-hoo! It's a Texas rodeo, yes|indeed. We'll hose 'em down... and be right back|after this commercial break. When I say "cut, "|you stop talking. We've been through this before.|You're fun and the audience likes you, but I'm not gonna lose|my license over this shit. Why would you lose|your license? It's called Standards and Prac|- Jeff, pick up seven. Thank you. Standards and Practices.|You ever heard of it? Yeah? Oh, he's funny, yeah. Yeah, right, yeah, sure. Sells suits. Tomorrow at 10:00? I'll ask him.|Hold on. Can you come in tomorrow|morning, meet the boss at 10:00? - What for?|What I would do is... have a swimming pool|and a sauna... Boring. Come on,|you could do better than that. Line four. Nancy, what would|you do with a million bucks? Barry,|I just love your show. Send me your measurements and a nude|photograph, and I'll get back to you. Line one, Frank in Grapevine.|Yeah, Frank? I'm a Chicano-|Good for you. I'm a Jew. Now, this is serious, dude.|Wrong show. Look, Stu, I don't think we've had a decent|answer to this question all night long. Now, come on, people,|you gotta give me a good answer, Yeah, hold on.|or I'm gonna punish ya. Okay, let's go to... Let's go to|- Here, talk to Barry. Come on. Talk to Barry. Line one, you're on. Say something,|anything. Ready? Say something. Say something. Uh,|yeah, this is Cheryl Ann. What are you gonna do with|a million bucks, Cheryl Ann? If I had a million bucks, I would|buy my own radio transmitter... and start my own|talk show, so I wouldn't have to listen|to your voice. If you hate my voice so much,|why don't you change the station? I can't.|Why not. I'm in prison, and the warden|picks the shows we listen to. Good. You're Iying. You love my voice. I hate your voice.|You love my voice. It's a love-hate situation. You|can't get enough of my voice. Come on. Admit it.|You're full of it! If you don't love my voice,|then hang up. Come on. Hang up. You love me. Come on.|Hang up. Hang up! I hate you,|Barry Champlaign! Beautiful. I love it. Not good enough. Folks,|you let me down once again. For that,|you must be punished. This is the Bee Gees, and this|one's going out to you, Cheryl Ann, singing "Saturday Night Fever"|ten times in a row. - Best call we've had in|a couple of weeks, I swear. That was great, honey. We gotta|get Cheryl Ann calling more often. They're eating this stuff up, Barry.|See that piece in the paper today? The thing about me looking for|a bodyguard? Great publicity. You want this ten times|in a row, seriously? No, make it three times.|I'll be back in a minute. Three it is.|Beautiful show. I love it. # Burn, baby, burn # # Burn, baby, burn #|In here? Ooh. That was great.|The kiss or the call? Dan just gave me|some good news. I'm getting|the 10:00 a.m. slot. He's hiring a producer|just for my own show. Oh, Barry, that's wonderful.|Yeah. You wanna do it? Huh? You'd be the best person to do it. You're smart, you're hardworking,|you do everything I tell you to do. Um, Barry, I think you|better get someone else. I don't think it's a good|idea. It's a great idea. Come on.|You gotta do it. No, I don't think so. Do|it. Come on. I need you. Barry, if I work for you, the|fun would go out it, you know? There'd be a lot of tension. It|might even screw up our marriage. Fuck our marriage. Come on.|This is important. I need you. Don't you want the show to be as good|as it can be? Aren't you behind me? You gotta be joking.|Of course I'm not joking. You just said,|"Fuck our marriage." I'm joking. This is getting really boring.|I'm gonna switch it, all right? I just thought that... Forget it. I'm very proud of you. It's wonderful for you. Come on. Okay? Hmm?|Come on. Okay? Barry? Baby, I don't wanna go|in the sink. Yeah! In the sink! I don't wanna go|in the sink. Oh-ho!|Hi, Ellen! Hi, Stu. Are you having a party?|Yeah, a sink party. Oh, uh, hi, hon. My mother wasn't|feeling well, so I decided to come home. Ellen, I thought you|and your mother were... uh-|Eh... Um, what... what are you two up to? Look, I better go out and|come back in. Barry, come back. You cut me off! Hey, Theresa, come here.|Come with Stuey, and have a Stuey sandwich|with Mimi and Stuey. You want one? No. He became a millionaire.|How about that? Brings back memories. A lot of changes. I'm|nicer, I make more money... and I only hang up|on one out of seven. ...with Dallas' own Mr.|Popularity, Barry Champlaign. I'm Sidney Greenberg, reminding|you that it's not how much you take, it's how much|you take home. Hey! How's Chicago? You look great.|Great. You look great too. Ellen, what are you|doing here? I couldn't miss|Barry's premiere. Yeah, we only have a couple of|minutes. You mind if I steal Barry? You know where the green room is.|Have a cup of coffee. We'll catch up. Sure. Bye. Evening, Barry. I have|two minutes. What is it? I'll make it brief. I know|you've got your show to do. Barry, we've run into some|slight scheduling problems... concerning|the national feed. We're gonna have to delay it|for at least a couple of weeks. Hi, Stuey. Ellen! Holy cow!|I knew you'd show up. Jesus, let me look at you here. Are|you taking young pills or something? Wanna step into my crib|with me? You must be excited. Oh, yeah, I'm jumping out|of my skin. You kidding me? I called my mother and told her we're|gonna broadcast all over the country. She says, "Stuart, that's|beautiful. What country?" Good to see you.|It's good to see you. Hi, I'm Laura Nicholson. I|spoke to you on the phone. Hi. Oh, it's nice to meet you.|You must be Barry's secretary. No, actually, I'm his producer. We're|going in a few seconds. Excuse me. Let's go. From the heart|of the Lone Star state, it's time for Dallas' most|popular talk show, Night Talk... - with Barry Champlaign.|- # Bad to bone # The KGAB phone lines are open|and ready for your call... at 555-TALK. Nice to meet you. Nice to|meet you. Isn't this exciting? I've just received|some terrible news. Night Talk will not be broadcast|nationally tonight... due to the usual corporate,|big business, inefficiency, sloppiness and bureaucracy. I've just been informed|of a scheduling problem. Nothing personal, nothing|logical, just business as usual. Maybe the show will go national|next week, maybe next month. No one seems to know.|I'm sorry. I feel I've let you,|the listeners, down. But I've been in this business long|enough to know you can lose the battle... and still win the war. Night Talk still has a purpose,|a standard to which it must rise, and I will not let you down|on that score. This show is about saying|what's got to be said. That's what|we're gonna do here tonight. Tonight, anything goes. I wanna hear you. I want you to|tell me what you really think. No holds barred. Call|555-TALK. I'm sorry. The door is open.|Hit me with your best shot. Night Talk.|Jerry from Rockwell. You're on.|Barry. Have you ever entertained|one single doubt... about the truth|of the Holocaust? I think we've had|this conversation before, sir. When you make these accusations against Jews,|when you start questioning the Holocaust, I think you should have some facts|available, and the facts are available. Well, of course. We'd love to|sit down and debate them with you. Uh-huh. Well, who's "we"? Am|I talking to a "we" or a "you"? Well, Barry, we're|organized in our belief... the same way the Zionists|are organized in their belief. We could debate it. It would|be very easy and simple. It would be far more simple and|valuable for you to get in touch with, let's say, the Holocaust|Museum down in Washington. Uh-huh. They'll send you|the names of all the Jews... who died during World War ll. They have all this information. I mean, the|first one to say if somebody made a mistake... They say six million died? It could've|been five million or seven million. It could be two also. Is that the issue? That two|million innocent people died? Why should one single innocent|person die, Jew or non-Jew? I agree. But the Zionists are using this issue|and the guilt on the American public... to extort from us|our tax dollars. The figures we have say|every family in Israel... gets over$10, 000|of our taxes. Well, you'll never see more|collective poverty than in Israel. I urge you to take a trip there. All you|got to do, Barry, is go to West Virginia. What does West Virginia have to|do with it? Or Nebraska or Idaho, where you'll see farmer after|farmer biting the dust, Mm-hmm. losing their farms, can't|get decent loans. Yeah. If we had the loans and grants|that are sent to Israel, we wouldn't be losing our farms,|which is the backbone of this country. And what if a woman competes with you|in the marketplace and takes your job? What if black men start dating|and marrying white women? Oh! And what if homosexuals|are teaching your children? And what if you're afraid|to walk the streets at night? What if you see yuppies getting rich while|you're standing in the unemployment line? And what if your government|sends you to Vietnam... to fight a war they have|no chance of winning? And what if your country|is slipping away, lost? I know the argument, friend. It's the great theory of|history. I've heard it before. It says,|"When things ain't good, "instead of getting down|and doing something about it, instead of changing your life, it's a hell|of a lot easier to blame somebody else." And it just don't wash|in my book. Well, that's a very nice|speech, Barry, Mm-hmm. but it seems to me you're making|pretty good money on that station. And since you're an outsider|to these parts and all, it seems difficult, I guess, to relate|to the common-folk problems out here. There is no room for self-pity,|sir, in my life or yours. Now, you ought to read the Turner Diaries,|Barry, by William Pierce. It's all there. Mm-hmm.|It says... Yes, I'm familiar with that novel|- a product of the enlightened man. Now, let me finish!|Barry, I got Beauty on five. What it does is lays out the plan|for the coming revolution. Mm-hmm. See, the word "America, "Barry, means|"heavenly kingdom" in the gothic language. Yeah. It's the real new|Jerusalem of Scripture. It shows you how the Jews|are impostors who took... Yeah, yeah, yeah. For those|of you who don't know it, it starts idiotically enough in|the year 1991. That's correct. It's written as a diary by a young,|white, racist, electrical engineer... who joins an underground|paramilitary organization... known as "The Order."|That's right. Oh, am I doing all right?|Oh, great. They institute a revolution|against ZOG, the Zionist Occupied Government|of America. And along the way, they kill|all the mongrel races... Jews, blacks,|homosexuals, feminists... and other mud people. It's an idiotic book written for|people with bubble gum brains... who never got out of the fourth|grade, watching reruns of The Blob. Easy, Barry.|You're part of the problem. You're another Jew,|another weed-eating Jew, in control of the media|of this country. And from there, you pass judgement|on that which you don't know. And there will come a day for you,|Barry, and thousands of others like you... who have slept with black women,|who have lied to us... when you will hang from your neck|with a placard around it saying, "I betrayed my race. " Well, what can you say to|a paranoid schizophrenic... who's a coward for hanging up, except|that I guess the day that I hang, I'll probably defend the asshole|who hung me. Talk radio. Free speech|isn't really free at all. It's actually a little bit like Russian|roulette. A very expensive commodity. You never know what's gonna come up|the next time you push the button. Yeah, you're on Night Talk.|I changed my name... and didn't have any trouble|getting Social Security. My birth certificate has|my name spelled differently. And I-|Hello? Yeah, it's very interesting.|What's your view on lesbian priests? My view on what?|How about masturbation? You got any view on that?|No, I don't. How about that law in Arizona|where it's a felony... to go around with|an erection in your pants? What do you think about that? Well,|I-I'm not really calling about that. Mm-hmm. If they wanna|do it, let 'em do it. Yeah, what? Kent's on three. I don't|think you should take the call. Lose him, Barry.|Barry? Hello? Yeah, yeah. Well, that's just fine|for you. Tell him to shoot it to me. Hello, Barry? Hello?|Well, good, good. That's good for you. Gee, tonight's just|a walk down memory lane. And we have Kent with us|once again. Yeah, Kent. I didn't|mean to hang up on you. Yeah, but you did. Listen, Kent,|you're a fake. You're a hoax. You call up with some fake-o story|about how you and your girlfriend... are taking drugs|and she's O.D.'d... and your parents are in Acapulco. Fiji. Oh, Fiji, right.|An important detail. You're just this poor, mixed-up|kid. You don't know what to do. I think she's dead!|What are you trying to tell me? That your girlfriend O.D.'d? Now|she's dead? I don't know, okay? I just can't get her to wake|up! Yeah, we heard that already. There's foam coming|out of her mouth. What? Foam coming out of her mouth. Let's dump this guy, now.|It's Barry's show, boss. That's it. That's it.|Listen! My parents are in Fiji,|okay? And the stuff about my girlfriend|- Yeah, what? She|- Come on, Kent. Spit it out. No, you'll cut me off!|I won't cut you off, Kent. You promise? I promise I won't|cut you off, Kent. I made the whole thing up! Kent? I lied. I'm cutting you off. What? Get the hell out of here. No,|please! Look, I'm not Iying! I gotta talk to you.|You gotta talk to me? What are you gonna talk about?|Your mother just slit her wrists? She's bleeding to death? How about your father? Got a shotgun|in his mouth? Gonna blow his brains out? Tell me, who else is dead?|Come on. Who's dead, Kent? Who's dead? Who's dead?|Tell me, who's dead? No one's dead!|No one's dead, Barry. Come on. Look. I just wanted to talk. We're|talking. You got two seconds. Talk. Okay, I listen to you all|the time, you know. Mm-hmm. I think about what you say, Bar. Yeah. You say such cool stuff.|Mm-hmm. Well, I just didn't know|what to say, you know. Look, I wanted to meet you. Now you're goofing on me.|You wanted to meet me? You can meet me anytime you want.|I'm right here in the station. You're at the station? I'm not|the president, for God's sakes. I'm right here, downtown,|in the studio. So I could just come down?|You could just come down. Now? Right now?|Now. What do you mean, right now? Right now. I'll just come down.|I'm on the air, Kent. Please? Sure, Kent. Why not?|Come on down. Really? I'd love to meet you.|Just hurry up. Allright! I'm halfway through the show. We're|at the end of the first hour... of exciting and intellectual|conversation here on Night Talk. Don't go away. We have the|news and the weather coming up. And then we'll be back|with more Night Talk. Barry.|Dan. Laura, call down and tell|Security there's a kid coming. Dan, you want anything?|Coffee? Tea? Insulin? Crack?|We have it all right here. Barry, you should ask me if you|wanna have a guest on the show. Why? 'Cause I'm the|boss, Barry. That's why. Dan, I'll do my job,|you do yours, okay? He is not coming on the show.|That's it. We have too much riding... on what's going on here tonight.|What's going on here tonight? If they think for one minute that|you're undependable, it's over. Dan, Metro Wave bought my show.|All right? This is my show.|I put who I want on my show. If I wanna have Charlie Manson on|my show, I'll put him on the show. Or Ted Bundy|- Or how about this. I have David Berkowitz, Bernard Goetz,|John Hinckley on. We do a special on gun|control. How would that be? Or how about that postman from|Oklahoma who killed 14 people, Dan? He killed his boss. We|bring him on the show. Cut. We bring you on as a|special guest. Out. Out. We're gonna bring these guys on the|show. We'll have a terrific show. Oh, boy, this'll be great. That's funny stuff, Barry,|the mailman who killed his boss. Did you see what the mailman|brought me today? Huh? We got half the wackos|within 20 miles of this place... saying how much they wanna|"burn your Jew ass." Think about that, Barry. The time it|takes to sit down and write that on paper, put it in an envelope, lick|it, send it to the station. And I've got boxes|of this shit in my office. These people|are dead serious. All I'm suggesting is that you simply|pull it back, just for a little bit. I think you're a little|out of your depth, Dan. I think it's time|- Just stop talking and listen to me for two minutes! You don't have an audience|in here now to cheer you on. You do whatever you want to tonight,|Barry. Have fun. Blow the deal. I'm not gonna say I don't care,|because I worked very hard on this. - I worked my ass off on this.|- This is my life you're talking about. No, what you are, Barry, is a fucking|suit salesman with a big mouth. Let's call a spade a spade. It's a job.|That's all it is. You can come in here and start predicting|Armageddon if you want to, Barry. But it's still a job. A job you did not even know|how to do... until I taught it to you! What do you think you're doing|in here, changing the world? This is a talk show, Barry,|and you are a talk show host. Alan does the drive time, Jerry|does the home handyman stuff, Sheila does the shrink stuff, Sid does the|financial stuff, and you hang up on people. That's your job. Now, you're very good at it.|You're the joker in my deck, and I'm very happy|for your success. But you work for me! I'm your boss. You wanna have the kid|on the show? Have him on! But you get one thing straight.|You fuck up my deal, and you go back to selling|double-knit suits. I'm glad you take it|all so seriously, Barry, but you gotta learn when to stop|or it's gonna kill you. Go get the kid. The kid|is not a good idea, Barry. You're on his side, aren't you? No,|I want you to think about the show. You could lose everything that you've|worked for and everything I've worked for. Get the kid. It's very important to Barry. It's a very important moment|in his life. Yes, he is important to me.|He is important. Look, Lou,|he's a fuckin' basket case. Lou- Allright, allright.|Forget it. Forget it. I'll just stay to see the show tonight,|and then I'll be home tomorrow, okay? Love you. Yeah. Hey. Just pretend I'm visiting|a sick relative. All right? Bye. Yeah. Night Talk. We're back. This is|the spirit of Barry Champlaign. Joe, hit me with your|best shot. Yeah, Barry. I've been driving a cab now|for about 11 years. I've met all kinds. I|know people. I wish I did. Let me tell you|something, friend. That kid who just called, what he|needs is a good bust in the chops. Think that would do it, Joe? Kid|like that needs some discipline. Discipline?|I got two kids, Barry. They give me any trouble,|I just take off my belt. They see the belt,|that's it. How old are your children, Joe? Little|girl's five, boy's three and a half. You hit them with a belt?|Brush, belt, newspaper. Whatever. Hey, they're either gonna get it from|me or they're gonna get it out there. Joe, I think you need|professional help. What's that? You need to get together with|Jerry. He can hold them down... while you hit them with a belt.|What the hell are you talking about? You're hitting your kids with|brushes and belts. You're psychotic. You're a psycho. Yeah? And|what are you, friend, a faggot? Coming from a pinhead like you,|that's a complement. How about I come on down there to|that station of yours right now... and bust your little|faggot face right in? Who's gonna help, your brother? You|don't say nothin' about my brother. Your brother hangs around Harry|Heinz Blvd., doesn't he? He's a pimp. And your wife, she's a|hooker, isn't she? My wife? What do you beat her with,|a baseball bat? Hmm? Well, I know where|you live, partner. Allright?|I know what you look like. Mm-hmm.|Sweet dreams, sweetheart. I can't wait. Vincent, you're on Night Talk.|Say something interesting. Yeah. Uh-|Yeah. I've been listening to|you for five years. Uh-huh. Yup, and the guys down here at|the store put you on every night. Yup. And we sit around|and laugh at you... Yup. because you're|such a jerk-off and... Yeah, all right.|Night Talk. Agnes, yeah. Barry, can I ask you a question? Hit me. I wouldn't hit you|for the world, sweetheart. I Love Lucy. Now, why don't|they make more of them? What? What do you want to talk|to Barry about? You wanna rape somebody? Why don't you go home and take|a cold shower. That'd be better. Those shows are ancient, Agnes. Lucille|Ball must be at least 105 years old. The rest of the cast is dead.|No. Now, she's not that old. I saw her on the show the other|night, and she looked to be around 35. And that Ricky Ricardo,|boy, can he play the bongos. Nobody can be this stupid. Are you|serious, Agnes? You know what year this is? Yeah, John,|you're on Night Talk. Remember me, Barry? I called and said|I was in Turtle Creek. Well, I... I raped three women since then. Do you remember me? I'm|not sure. Refresh me, John. I'm thinking about raping another|one, Barry. I saw her this morning. What are you doing to me, Stu? You're|killing me right here on the air. - Oh, could we relax, please?|- These women I raped aren't turning me in. How come? Well, tell|me where you are, John, and I'll make sure|you get some help. You have my word on that. I'm|just so tired of raping women. I... I'm so tired|of raping women! I|- I got rage for them! I got rage for them! John. When was the last time|you raped a woman? In Greenville|a couple weeks ago. She was-|She was struttin' around... like she was something else. Yeah, I-I understand, John.|I sympathize. We all get angry. Where did the rape|actually occur? It was in the backseat|of her car. She pulled into|the Jack in the Box parking lot. I jumped in and said,|"Okay, I'm-" It was nighttime, sometime.|I don't know. How old are you, John?|I'm 40. I was in the pen 12 years.|Are you taping this for me? I didn't get no therapy. They didn't|do nothin' for me! Let me hook this up. They didn't- They didn't-|They didn't bother to help me! Barry, I'm gonna rape somebody.|I'm gonna do it. But why? I gotta!|It's an irresistible compulsion. It's like- It's like|tryin' to quit smoking. Barry, I can't help myself. I can't... Yeah, all right. You have|this irresistible compulsion. John, the last time we spoke, you said that|jogging helped you. Up and down Turtle Creek. Jogging up and down the|Turtle Creek. Turtle Creek! I could name you every duck|in Turtle Creek! John, have you decided|who you're gonna rape next? I got her picked out,|staked out and ready. I always wanted her. What is it about her|that you like? What is it about a piece of strawberry|pie or a piece of pumpkin pie? I mean, I don't know.|She could be black or white, Hispano, Japanese,|pretty, fat, ugly. I wanna rape them all! All right, John, calm down. I|wanna help you. I'm your friend. Are you my buddy, Barry? I'm your buddy, John. I can't help myself.|I gotta go do it. You can help yourself. You're not|gonna do it, John. No, I gotta do it. No, you're not|gonna do it, John. Now, listen to me.|I'm gonna go do it. No, no, no. Think about|what you're saying, John. John? He's gone. Another lost soul|goes into the Dallas night. We-We have a police trace|on this. If anybody knows|anything about this man... or is in Turtle Creek or|sees someone in a phone booth, please call us here|at KGAB. The number to call is,|is 555-TALK. Uh, let's hear|from our sponsors... Pasty Mate Roach|and Termite Cleaners. Listen closely. The sound|of cockroaches mating... enhanced 500 times.|They couldn't trace it. Right, I should've kept him on|for another three hours. You know, I once had|a cup of Humphrey's coffee. I was spitting blood|for three weeks. You should try|the decaffeinated, Barry. This is great.|Oh, wait. Don't tell me. He seems|pretty harmless. Come on, kid, sit down.|This is your chair. This is your microphone.|Speak directly into it. Keep your mouth about|six inches away from it. These are your headphones so you can|hear the show. These are the ground rules. What?|The ground rules. No last names, no brand names,|no phone numbers over the air. Other than that, act and speak|normally. This is Mr. Barry Champlaign. You're Barry. You got him.|All right. What's wrong with him?|He's star struck. Hey, kid, say something. I need|a level. Check, check. Check one. Here we go on five, four, three, two, one.|Stu. Strap in, bitch.|Here we go. We're back. I'm Barry Champlaign.|You're listening to Night Talk. We have a very special guest|with us tonight. Kent. Say hello|to everybody, Kent. All right. My sentiments exactly. We've brought Kent on board to get an|inside look at the future of America. Kent is the classic|American youth... energetic and resourceful,|spoiled, perverse and disturbed. Would you say that's an accurate|description, Kent? Yep, sure. What do you call that haircut?|I don't know. Rock and roll! Are you high right now,|Kent? Am I high?|Are you on drugs, or is this your naturally|moronic self? Watch the drool. You're|getting it all over the console. I can't believe|I'm here, man. Hey. Wow. Does this thing really work? You're sitting in|a radio station, Kent. You're sitting in front|of a live mike. When you speak, thousands|of people hear your voice. It penetrates their minds. Okay, okay.|No, listen. I wanna send that one out to Diamond|Dave and Billy the bass player... and all the babes|at the Valley View Mall. We're discussing|America here tonight, Kent. Do you have any thoughts|on that subject? Yeah.|Oh, I'm sorry. I broke your train of thought. Please,|keep going. This is exhilarating. No, I know. It's not like I'm not political|or nothin'. You know, I mean... I like Bruce.|He's political. Bruce Springsteen, yes.|A very deep, political thinker. He's a communist, isn't he? No, he's from New Jersey. His ex is pretty nice.|Mm-hmm. Whose ex? Bruce's. Bruce Springsteen's|wife. Yes, what about her? Julienne.|Hi, Julienne. She was a model.|You know that, Bar? All those guys|got models, Bar. I mean, Mick and Jerry,|Keith and Patty, Prince and... Prince. You know, Bar,|Bingo. models only hang around with|guys they think are coolest. Look at you, man. You're a|big guy, famous star and all. I mean, you got that fine babe|right over there... who works for you, man. So hey, if you got some|cash and you're cool, you get to have a model. So you wouldn't call yourself a|women's libber then, Kent, huh? Yeah, I would, Bar. I mean,|everybody being liberated, you know. Women, South Africans, all|those kind of people, you know. I saw a show|about all that stuff... about how revolution's|a pretty important thing. We're gonna have a lot more|revolutions where people get together, solidarity and that|and... You know,|like that song by Megadeath. # Peace sells|but who's buying # # Peace sells but who's|buying # Ah, come on! Hey, plus-|Oh, I saw this other show... about how in the future they're|gonna have these two-way TV sets. People will be able to see|each other and everything. And then there's, like, no way they're|gonna be able to stop the revolution. Who won't be able|to stop it, Kent? Big Brother, the government,|corporations. They're a bunch of fascists. They|wanna control everybody's mind. But, hey, freedom's|an important thing, just like you|always say, Bar. You say|the best things, Bar. I listen to you|all the time. You're great.|Kent, you're an idiot. I sincerely hope you do not|represent the future of this country, because if you do|we are in sad shape. Bar, man,|you're so funny, man. That's why I love to listen to your show.|That's why all the kids listen to you, man. Plus, these goons|push you around, you know. All the kids|listen to you, Bar. You are the best thing|on the radio! Kent, we discuss a lot of|serious subjects on this show... sad things, frightening|things, tragic things. Doesn't any of that|bother you? Nope. Why not? It's just a show. It's one|big rock video, huh, Kent? Yeah! No.|Come on, Bar. It's your show. Yeah, that it is, that it is.|It's my show. Let's go back to the callers|on my show. Uh, Julia,|you're on Night Talk. Barry, hello.|Now, you know, darlin', I think these people who've|been callin' you tonight... are a bunch of|I don't know what's. It's crazy. And that crazy kid you|got on there, now, that's terrible. I've been listenin' to your show|for five years straight, Barry, and I love you and your show. I think it's terrific that more|folks are gonna be listenin'. I just hope you have time for|your longtime friends there, Bar. I always have time|for my friends, Julia. Aw, you're terrific. Your show's terrific.|I don't know what else to say. Well, tell me something, Julia,|since you listen all the time. What is it|you like about the show? Well, I don't know. A lot of things. Well, what, for instance?|Well, I love you, Bar. Uh-huh, that's a given. Okay,|what about me do you love? Well, you're very funny.|Uh-huh. And I love to hear you talk about|all the things you have to say. Yeah, yeah, okay.|Let's get back to the show. The show must serve|some kind of purpose for you. Well, now, I wouldn't say that.|What would you say? Well, I don't know. What|do you mean, you don't know? You said that at least five times|already. What don't you know? You've been listening to this show for five|years. You don't know why you listen to it? Well, I just said-|I heard what you just said. You said you don't know why you listen|to this show. Why don't I tell you why. You listen so that you can feel|superior to the other losers who call in! Barry!|Don't "Barry" me! You've got sawdust between your ears|instead of brains. Just listen to you! If I sounded as stupid as you, I'd|be too embarrassed to open my mouth! I'm hanging up!|Good, and don't call back. Nothing more boring|than people who love you. Yeah, you're on Night Talk. I just have one thing|to ask you, Barry. Hit me. Are you as ugly-looking|as you sound? Uglier. Yeah, I thought|you'd say something like that. But as usual,|you avoid the question. What's the question?|I think you know the question. Is an animal a vegetable or a|mineral? The question is obvious. Why does an intelligent fellow|like yourself... spend so much energy|hurting other people? Hmm?|Do you not love yourself? I think you're very|lonely, Barry. I'm sorry for you, because|you don't know how to love. Night Talk. Ralph. They always say that,|don't they? "Why are you so angry"? Well, they don't understand|me and you, Barry. We're the kind of people,|we feel too much. Are we, Ralph? Yeah, my name is Cheryl Ann.|I'll hold. Who knows? I mean,|take, for instance, cancer. What is cancer?|What are you doing, Ellen? He's all alone out there.|So what? He's going down in flames,|Dan. It's Barry's show,|Ellen. Let Barry|do Barry's show. Well, what are they gonna do|with my TV set? We watch it. That's what|people do with TV sets. What do they see? They see people|killing people, babies starving, floods. And for what?|For nothing! For beer commercials|and Tampax ads, MTV, a yacht, the ocean, a diamond earring,|a racehorse. Well, I guess so. I guess so. All I know is|what I read in the papers. And that's a lot of talk. Barry,|it's talk. Talk, talk, talk. Talk, talk, talk, talk, talk, talk,|talk, talk! Ralph, Ralph, Ralph! Tell me something.|I'm curious. How do you dial a phone|with a straightjacket on? Barry. I don't know much about God|and I never was very religious, but you can't help feeling|like something is wrong, like nobody's|driving the train, the system, 'cause too many people|are gettin' sick. And the traffic,|it's just jamming up. And even the weather,|not so good lately. Barry, I just don't|- I don't get it, Barry. I just don't get it. You don't get it, wimp? Here's|what you get! You get $1.59, That's it. go down to the drugstore,|buy a pack of razor blades, and slash your|fuckin' wrists, pinhead! That's it, kid.|Come on. What?|Get him out of here, now! Hey, Barry! Get the fuck off me,|you fuckin' son of a bitch! Thank you, Dallas!|Good night! You allright, Barry?|Standby. I'm confused, Barry. What did you say|your name was? Cheryl Ann. It's about my ex-husband. He's back in town and, well,|I haven't seen him for a while. What are you confused about,|Cheryl Ann? Well, let me first say... that I left my ex-husband|for very good reasons. Did it- Let's not|get into them, okay? And he's anything but perfect. He smokes, he drinks,|he loves to argue. Sounds like my kind of guy.|Yeah. He is a little bit like you. Yeah, well, we gotta move|it along here, Cheryl Ann. You wanna get to the point? I have, um,|feelings for him. What kind of feelings? Nice feelings. Um... This is hard to say. Sexual feelings? It's not just that.|I mean, yes, of course, but... I still love him. It's not the same|with my husband. We had something, and... I want him. I want him inside of me. I want to take care of him. I want to be with him. You wanna be close to him. Yes. You wanna hold him. Oh, yes. You wanna relive|the feelings you two had. Yes, Barry. You don't love|your husband? No. Well, I... You tell him|that you love him. You lie to him and|you tell him that you love him. I do love him. I love him as a friend. Friend. Everyone's your friend. Not like my ex-husband. There's a passion there|for his soul and... I- I thought I wanted a|simple life, but I-I was wrong. I want my old life back. Sounds like|you made a mistake. Should've stuck with|the first guy. Yeah, well, what was I|supposed to do? I love you, Barry. Ever hear the story of the little|dog who had a bone in his mouth? And he's trotting over this|bridge and he looks over... and sees his reflection|in the water. Thinks it's another dog. That dog has a bone|in his mouth too. The dog wants both bones, so he|barks at the little dog in the water, trying to scare him. Bone drops out of his mouth. Loses both bones. What has that got to do|with what I just said? Babe, I don't know|what to tell you. You blew it! You know, women like you|are never happy. What do you want me to say? Leave|your husband? Go back to your ex? Your ex doesn't want you. He's got women all over the|place. He doesn't need you. He's not some suburban zombie like|your husband. He's out there having fun. Did you ever think of that? Maybe|your ex-husband doesn't want you? Hmm? He came on to me.|He said he wanted me. You're Iying again.|He said he still loved me. You're Iying! You're a sexually|unsatisfied woman living in a dream world! I feel sorry for you! So why don't you stick|with Mr. America there, go out and buy yourself a heavy-duty|vibrator, and knock yourself out. We reap what we sow. Follow me, Cheryl Ann? Probably frigid.|And we have Theresa on the line. The day will come|for you, Barry. And there will be|a reckoning, an adding up|and a totaling. Those who turned away|will be turned upon. And I don't care|what your story is, Barry. You are responsible, and there|will be no confusion at your trial. It will be short,|and necks will crack. The whips will strip your back|bare to the bone, and your children|will cry for you... as they are slaughtered|before your eyes. You... The Jews will hang high|over the streets. You will be buried in piles. You dig your own holes. I am here merely to tell you|that the day will come. It will. Believe it or not,|you make perfect sense to me. I should hang. I'm a hypocrite. I ask for sincerity,|and I lie. I denounce the system|as I embrace it. I want money and power|and prestige. I want ratings and success. I don't give a damn about you|or the world. That's the truth. For this, I could say I'm|sorry, but I won't. Why should I? I mean, who the hell are|you anyways, you audience? You're on me every night|like a pack of wolves, 'cause you can't stand facing|what you are and what you've made. Yes, the world|is a terrible place. Yes, cancer and garbage|disposals will get you. Yes, a war is coming. Yes, the world is shot to hell,|and you're all goners. Everything's screwed up, and|you like it that way, don't you? You're fascinated|by the gory details. You're mesmerized|by your own fear. You revel in floods,|car accidents. Unstoppable diseases. You're happiest|when others are in pain. That's where I come in,|isn't it? I'm here to lead you by the|hands through the dark forest... of your own hatred|and anger and humiliation. I'm providing a public service. You're so scared. You're like a little child|under the covers. You're afraid of the bogeyman,|but you can't live without him. Your fear, your own lives,|have become your entertainment. Next month, millions of people are|gonna be listening to this show, and you'll have|nothing to talk about! Marvelous technology|is at our disposal. Instead of reaching up to new heights,|we're gonna see how far down we can go. How deep into the muck|we can immerse ourselves. What do you wanna|talk about, hmm? Baseball scores? Your pet? Orgasms? You're pathetic. I despise each|and every one of you. You got nothing, absolutely nothing. No brains, no power, no future. No hope. No God. The only thing|you believe in is me. What are you|if you don't have me? I'm not afraid, see? I come in every night, make my case,|make my point, say what I believe in! I tell you what you are.|I have to. I have no choice. You frighten me. I come here every night, tear into|you, I abuse you, I insult you, and you just keep|coming back for more. What's wrong with you?|Why do you keep calling? I don't wanna hear it anymore.|Stop talking! Go away! You're a bunch of yellow-bellied,|spineless, bigoted, quivering, drunken,|insomniatic, paranoid, disgusting, perverted,|voyeuristic, little obscene phone callers. That's what you are. Well, to hell with you. I don't need your fear and your|stupidity. You don't get it. It's wasted on you. Burros before swine. If one person out there|had any idea... of what I'm talking about... Fred, you're on Night Talk. Yes. You see, Barry, I know it's depressing that so many|people don't understand you're just joking. Jackie, you're on Night Talk. Hello. I've been listening for years,|and I find you a warm and intelligent... Arnold. What you were saying before about|loneliness, I'm an electrical engineer... Lucy. My mother is from Waco and wants|to know if you went to high school... Larry. Why do people insist|on calling homosexuals normal? Ralph!|I'm in my house. I'm at home, which is where|you should be, Barry. Hey, I'm not far away.|You could come over if you want. We're the same kind of people. I have beer, soup. I'm here. Come over later. I'll wait. Barry, there's 60 seconds|left in the show. This is dead air, Barry. Dead air. I guess we're stuck|with each other. This is Barry Champlaign. Barry. That was great.|I feel very good about this. I'm gonna talk to the lawyers, and we'll|get started on this deal right away. We're gonna be seeing|a lot more of each other. I'll be in touch. Barry. That was great. You pulled it off, champ.|Congratulations. I'll see you tomorrow. Dan. What if I don't come in|tomorrow night? You'll come in tomorrow,|Barry. You always do. She left, huh?|Yep. I don't blame her. Her best line was, "Barry|Champlaign's a nice place to visit, but I wouldn't want|to live there." The show's a washout, Stu. Give me a break, will you?|We're going national, man. Besides, it's not that|important. It's just one show. If it's not that important, why|am I doing it? I don't know, Barry. You don't like the heights,|don't climb the mountains. You know what I mean? It's|like that kid just said: "Man, this is your show." Where you headed? I don't know. Go to|Ellen's hotel, try to talk. That's good.|Tomorrow, Barry. Before I take|the first caller this evening, Tomorrow, Stu. I'd like to|comment on something I saw... in the parking lot|on the way into the station. There was a man standing there,|Walk you to your car? obviously mentally disturbed. It made me think about something|we don't often talk about. Wanna grab a burger,|just talk? I'm too old for you,|Laura. Ow. I mean, you don't|know about Vietnam, Easy Rider, Beatles. Start over, Grandpa. I can't. I'm inside this thing. You're not. You know what|my greatest fear is? Being boring. You're not boring. I'm afraid that the whole|audience is gonna get up and leave. I get confused sometimes|about this love stuff. I don't know what people mean|when they say that they're in love, but... but I do know that I don't think|you're the bad guy you think you are. Yes, I am. I'll take a rain check|on that burger. Excuse me, Barry.|Barry. Mr. Champlaign. I hate to bother you. Do you think|you could give me an autograph, please? Some show tonight.|Sure. What'd you say your name was?|You're dead, fucker. You come on down|to these parts, you start telling people their|business and insulting their race, you end up like Champlaign,|I'll tell you that right now. I listened to his show the|night that he was killed. There was this drug-crazed|kid bothering him. When people smoke that crack|stuff, they go berserk, you know? I hope they catch|that kid. But they ought to listen to|that show. He was on the air. I didn't think he was gonna|get shot or anything, but that show was strange. I mean, I got to be on his show the|last day. That was his last show. I feel kinda like my whole|life is different, you know? Like I'm kinda blessed. But like I told Barry,|you know, I mean, hey, life is kinda just like|a big party thrown by God, and I'm the new|toastmaster, Bar. Like Barry always said, if you didn't like him,|turn him off. But they didn't have|to kill him. I think that young boy that had come|in on the show, I think he did it. I'll tell you|how I feel about it. I think if you steal something,|they oughta cut your hands off. If you rape somebody, they ought|a cut your you-know-what off. I never called him. And now I'm sorry. He never even hung up on me. I miss him. You know how when|you have a cast on your arm... and they cut it off,|you miss having it? He was like a cast|on my arm. I miss him. He was like a hot-fudge sundae|with fresh pecans. Now, I knew I shouldn't listen|to him 'cause he always got me... so dog-dang riled up till I|was like to smash my radio. He did a whole show once on which|way to roll your toilet paper. Over or under?|People responded for hours. Some got so angry,|they hung up. I called almost every night.|I loved Barry. Didn't care much for the fellow|who answered the phone, though. You know, he always forgot|I was waiting on the line. Didn't I read he was having some|kind of problem with his wife? Yes, he was|insensitive and nasty, but he was a strong, masculine|presence on the radio. Why would anyone|do such a thing? Oh, well, there's another|bright star in God's heaven. My view is that you don't give|a group like the neo-Nazis... access to the airways|like he did. Basically, I couldn't stand|Barry Champlaign. I was in love with his voice.|I was in love with his voice. He was in love|with his own voice. My first thought was that I couldn't|believe anyone could hate him that much. Disagree or dislike, but|not hate him. Not kill him. My second thought was... that he always wondered|if there was a God. Barry said he had to wait|until the evidence was in. Now you know, Barry. Now you know. Now, we know that whatever the law|says, it speaks to those under the law... so that every mouth|maybe stopped... and the whole world|may be held accountable to God. The world is crazy, crazy! Barry was rude, but|he was a funny guy too. He insulted my mother|when I called, but this is why we have|freedom of speech. I hope that when|they remember Barry, they remember|what he said... and not the style|in which he said it. It was karmic. You just can't put out|that much bad karma... without it coming|back at you. Barry and I worked together|for over seven years. Whenever you threatened him over the air,|man, he'd stick it right back in your face. It was like his dick|was flapping in the wing... and he liked to see|if he could get an erection. The guy had a little dick, but|he liked to flap it out there. Then they cut if off.|Now he's dead. I don't know if you|understand that analogy, but it's the clearest one|I can make.
