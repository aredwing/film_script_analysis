'Maybe it was the rotten weather we'd had, 'or the rotten cases I'd had - mostly chasing missing husbands 'and then their wives once I'd found them, to get paid. 'Or maybe it was just the plain fact that I am tired and growing old. 'The only real pleasure I'd had at all 'was following Joe DiMaggio of the New York Yankees. 'Well, it's the middle of July now and things are worse than in spring. 'In the spring, I wasn't holed up in a dingy hotel ducking the police.' Hello. Let me have Richmond 4421, please. Lieutenant Nulty, please. Nulty! I'm at the Casa Marina, room 502. Is Moose there? Come alone. - I asked if Moose was there. - And I said come alone. Two more murders. That's a total of seven. Do you know where Marlowe is? Casa Marina. He asked me to come alone. That's not a good idea. Now, you understand why we want him brought in, don't you? Yes, Commissioner. Good. Wait here. - How long? - Until you make Lieutenant. (Police siren ) (Knocking) - Yeah? - It's Snow White. - With or without the dwarfs? - Without. Come on in. Malloy with you? Relax. There's nowhere he could hide, under the bed or... This case has busted wide open and you're the patsy. - I wanna tell you... - It won't change anything. You gonna listen or aren't you? Sit down, will you? Sit down! I was working on a $25-a-day breeze, looking for a 15-year-old runaway from Carmel - an honours student, majoring in men. She had all ''A's'', none of them on a report card. She had only one other interest - dancing. # It seems to me I've heard that song before # It's from an old familiar score # I know it well... # It's funny how a theme recalls a favourite dream # A dream...# You know, you remind me of Harry. You're very much like Harry. The same type - strong and silent. I used to dance with Harry like this. I may not be the most beautiful girl... but I could make a man as happy... Really upset when it ended, but I got over it. - What did you say your name was? - Harry. My parents sent you, didn't they? I'm not going. Look, do you want to dance your way out, walk out, or be carried out? Makes no difference to me. (Tram bells) (Music continues in distance ) Do you realise we missed a dinner party to drive here from Carmel to get you? Can't you settle that on the way? There's the matter of $25 plus $5 in expenses. Pay him, Charles. And give him a tip. I don't accept tips for finding kids. Pets, yes - $5 for dogs, $10 for elephants... Thank you. Get in the car. (Thump and groan ) Next time she runs away, get somebody else. (Deep sigh) 'I was tryin' to stabilise below the belt 'when this guy the size of the Statue of Liberty walks up to me.' What are you, a cop? No, I'm your fairy godmother. 'I started to walk away...' Private dick, huh? 'when a hand I could have sat in took hold of my shoulder.' What's your name? Marlowe, what's yours? - Moose Malloy. - Get down! 'He didn't bat an eye. Fear wasn't built into his frame.' I want you to work for me. You want me to find the guys who were tryin' to shoot you? I want you to find my Velma. I ain't seen her in seven years. She ain't wrote in six. Where the hell have you been for seven years? In the can. The Great Bend bank robbery? Eighty grand? I did it solo. Ain't that somethin'? Yeah. I want you to find my Velma. Look, man, that's a long time not to hear. - She'll have a reason. - Sure. Why the hell were they shootin' at you? Maybe we ought to go to Florian's. That's the last place Velma worked. What was she like... this, um...Velma? Cute. Cute as lace pants. That's somethin' to go on. 'He walked me slowly across half of LA until we got downtown.' (Chatter in street) (Man ) Hello, Momma, how you doin'? (Woman ) You the last of the good time Charlies... This is a coloured neighbourhood now it's been that way for a long time. Let's you and me go up. Maybe nibble a couple. They might know something about my Velma. How the hell would they know anything? It's a coloured joint. Let's you and me go on up, huh? OK, but leave off carryin' me. I can walk by myself. I go to the bathroom by myself and everything. (Man ) Uh-oh, look who's here. (Moody blues ) (Indistinct chatter) A shine palace. (Man ) 52 years old and ain't never had enough of nothin', but used... What did I do this time? I'm looking for a white girl named Velma. Hey, Henry. No white boys here, brother. Just for the coloured. I'm looking for Velma. Velma, you says? No Velma here. No hooch, no girls, no nothing. Just scram, white boy. Just scram. Velma used to work here. Velma USED to work here. Velma done retired. (Group laugh) Send him home, Henry. You shouldn't laugh. Maybe I should do this. (Piano stops ) (Woman shrieks ) (Excited chatter) (Piano starts ) Well...looks like you just may have the lonely job of spending that eighty grand all by yourself. Now, you goin' to tell me where your boss is? Mr Montgomery is in the back. Big fella. Can I speak to you a minute, Mr Montgomery? - What's that? - A sawn-off. That's illegal. Besides, I don't think it'd stop him anyway. (Gunshot) All I wanted to know was where my Velma is. He tried to tell me with this. Jesus! You've had a busy day. It's a good thing you don't get out of the slammer too often. - I want you to find my Velma. - Yeah, I will. Meanwhile...ah, maybe you'd better beat it, huh? Because the cops might think you've sprained your parole. You got somethin' there. I'll keep in touch. - I'm in the telephone book. - OK. - Help me find my Velma, huh? - Yeah. Hey, ah...Malloy? This Velma. She got a last name? Valento. Velma Valento. Velma Valento. 'The fifty bucks felt snug against my ribs. 'The joint had emptied out, 'so I called you, Nulty, and had a few drinks. 'Mr Montgomery didn't seem to mind.' Right here, fellas. Big, black and dead. That's not bad for a killing. Lucky it wasn't somethin' serious. Don't worry about it Marlowe. It's just another shine killing. No space in the papers, no pictures, no nothin'. Your picture will be in the papers - front, sideways, back, numbers, don't you worry about it. No sweat. It was self-defence, Nulty. The guy that killed him is your...client? Yeah, that's right. When he gets in touch, tell him come to the station, sign a deposition. Oh, he can write, can't he? Oh, yeah...he might be a little shy. For that kind of a killing who cares? You explain it to him. We gotta follow procedure or I get in trouble...with Eleanor Roosevelt. Eleanor Roosevelt. 'I couldn't find any Florian in the phone book 'but I had a vague hunch about the fleabag across the street. 'I sparred with the night clerk for a minute, 'but it was like tryin' to open a busted sardine can. 'Abraham Lincoln's picture loosened him up.' I'm looking for anybody that knows the place across the street... Florians? When it was a white joint? There's a man, played in the band, upstairs in room 210. Is there an elevator around here? - If it is, I ain't seen it. - Thanks. 'The corridor gave me the willies. 'It was the kind of place I've always dreaded I'd wind up in, 'alone and broke.' Who is it? My name is Philip Marlowe. I'm a private investigator. I'm not with the City, the State or the Feds. I'm not with any collection agency. I'm looking for a...Florian. You used to work for him, didn't you? Come in. Thank you. - Please, sit down. - Thanks. The clerk tells me you used to have a band across the street. Yeah. Tommy Ray and the Sunrays. I had a couple of records. You ever hear 'em? - What you play? - Trumpet. This, um...Florian, did he have a first name? Mike. - Know where I can find him? - He's dead. Was he married? Could be. Know where she lives? What's in it for you? - A job. - Who for? A fellow's tryin' to find a Velma Valento. Remember her? She worked there too. I didn't know they had names. This, um...Mrs Florian have a first name? Jessie. You...ah, don't know where I could find her, huh? Couple of bucks in it. Well, if it comes back to you... get in touch, eh? You never know. So long. (Opens door) Mister! Mister! - Hey mister, my daddy wants you. - What for? - Are you a policeman? - No. Are you? - No. I'm a baseball player. - A baseball player. Come 'ere. 'Tommy Ray said she was listed under her maiden name, Jessie Halstead. 'Turned out she was living in a dried-out brown house 'with a dried-out brown lawn. 'He told me a pint of bourbon could be my best friend. 'I wondered if I should add it to the expenses.' (Dance-hall music) (Buzzer) Hello. Anybody home? Mrs Florian? Jessie Florian? Tommy Ray says you are. That a fact? You got a name? Oh. Marlowe. I'm a, ah...private detective. Can't be about Mike, he was put in a coffin four years ago. I feel like a fly out here. Come on in. I didn't have time to get fixed up or nothin'. (Music stops ) All the company I got. At least it doesn't give you an argument. Yeah. (Sniffs ) Well, Philip Marlowe, private investigator. Come in. Tommy Ray still living across the street with that nigger he married and that kid? Yeah, same place. Just about ruined him in show business, marryin' a nigger. He come to Mike's funeral. What d'you want to know? I'm looking for a girl. Velma. Velma Valento. A hot day, huh? Funny, when I'm thirsty it's all I can think about. It just so happens I, ah... Ooh! Careful mister. Don't want to be dropping anything this valuable. Why don't you, ah...step out and get us a couple of glasses? - Take a load off your feet. - Thanks. Velma. You know, I was in show business too. - Oh, yeah? - Yeah. Did a...song and dance act. That's how I met Mike. I used to work for him. He had a nice place for entertainment. I sure miss the business. Anyway... Jessie Harry. That was my, ah... That was my name. I was good. Had an agent and everything. Hmm. Did you ever catch my act? No, I don't believe I ever did. (Starts humming) # I'm blue all day Monday # Thinkin' of you Sunday (Hums again ) # That's one day when I'm with you # It seems like I cried all day Tuesday # I died all day Wednesday # Oh, my, how I long for you (Sniffling) # And then comes Thursday...# I was good, honest I was. I'm sure you were. Better than Velma. Maybe not as pretty, but I had a lot of pep. It's funny, she was the only tramp ever worked for Mike that he didn't use like a mattress. Oh? How come? I guess he was afraid. She had this boyfriend, a half-crazy hooligan. Built like a beer truck - Moose Malloy. He's in the can. Hmm...I get it. He's out of the can and he's lookin' for her, huh? You, ah...wouldn't have any idea where Velma is, would you? But I can find out. If I like a guy, ceiling's the limit. How about another drink? Sure. This stuff dies painless with me. Don't know what hit it. You wouldn't happen to have a picture of her around, would you? But Tommy Ray must have one. He didn't even know her name. Why would he say that? What was the name of that hotel again? Crescent. (Dials phone number) Tommy Ray, please. Tommy! Jessie Florian. Oh, it's OK, it's OK. He's here. 'It took her nearly ten minutes to convince Tommy Ray I was kosher. 'Then I went back to Ray's hotel to get a picture of Velma 'that he'd held out on me.' Andrew, got that picture? 'I figured there were plenty of girls as cute as lace pants, 'who'd passed through Hollywood in the last seven years. 'Most of them had taken those pants off while tryin' to make it. 'A friend who ran a club gave me an agent's name who knew most of them. (Agent) Cute little redhead. Song and dance gal. I never forget a face. Nice legs, too. And generous with 'em. But it's not a Velma. It's a... Linda! Linda...Gilbert. What happened to her? Did a couple of Busby Berkeley pictures, then she went nuts. But I really mean...ah, nuts. Where is she? Camarillo. May I? 'Changing her name to Linda Gilbert didn't help her make it, 'or keep her out of an asylum. 'When I saw her I knew why she hadn't contacted Moose. 'She wasn't getting in touch with anybody ever. 'I'd found Velma in only two days. DiMaggio was doing pretty good too. 'He'd now hit in 33 straight games. 'Nine away from the consecutive game hitting record.' Hi, Mr Marlowe. Kiss your five bucks goodbye, Georgie. Di Maggio's going all the way. We'll see. He's got nine more games to go. Each game gets tougher. I know what pressure is, Mr Marlowe. One time I won 19 straight. So you better watch how you spend that five bucks. - What about this Hitler? - What about him? - He invaded Russia. - So did Napoleon. It's a lot easier than hitting a 42 straight, right? Read all about it. Hitler invades Russia. 'I was thinking I was out of work again, 'with my bank account still under a duck, 'when I smelled my next client.' You're Philip Marlowe, private detective? Check. (Sniffs ) 'He smelled great.' Come on in. You've been recommended to me as someone who can be trusted to say, ah...keep his mouth shut. I'd like to discuss a matter. My name's Lindsay Marriott. Sit down. Well, what's the problem? It's a...very slight matter. I'm meeting some men tonight to pay them. I want someone with me. Do you carry a gun? - Sometimes. - You won't need it. I'd probably be better off going alone...but I'm not much of a hero. And I'll be carrying a... large amount of money. Yours? No. I'm acting for a friend. You want your hand holding? I don't like your manner. I get a lot of complaints about that. Who recommended me? I have to confess that...I picked your name out of the phone book. Well, why didn't you take the Triple A Detective Agency? Or any that come before me? I liked your name best. Really, I did. It's strong. (Sighs ) OK, go ahead. Have you heard of Fei Tsui jade? - No. - It's the only kind of real value. A few nights ago, a friend was wearing a necklace of it... and she was held up. - What's it worth? - Well over a hundred thousand. What's the plan? Go where I'm told, hand over the package of money and receive the necklace back. How much? $15,000, that's why I decided to have you with me. And I'm willing to pay you a hundred dollars. Now, wait a minute, You want to go off and park in some dark petting place. There's only one problem. By now this thing's been very well planned. There's not much likelihood of them roughing you up, as long as you play ball. But I don't think they'll like the idea of twins, one of us might get hurt. Not much I can do, Mr Marriott. However, I will take your $100 and tag along for the ride. I'll carry the shopping money. That means you'll come. What the hell, you're goofy about my name. Speaking of names, this friend of yours, what's her name? I'd prefer not to mention it. - Meet me at Beach Road at eight. - Check. At eight, then. Hey! I like your name too. Been judging a flower show in here, Marlowe? That the winning daffodil that just walked out? I'd a hunch you'd be around, so I sprayed. You said Malloy would come see me when he called. Just pretend you're a detective and figure out what happened. Can we talk alone? He makes me nervous. I feel I should be slippin' him a Finn. I don't have to take that shit from you, Marlowe. Wait outside. Come on, wait outside! And don't steal the doorknobs. I need Malloy. I gotta bring him in. The heat's on from upstairs. What happens if you don't? They gonna take that new suit? Why do you care about him? Since King Kong, I've been a sucker for any gorilla who falls in love. I'll nail you for aiding and abetting. Aiding what? You've got a dead Negro. Nobody cares. What's changed? Who tried to kill Malloy? We're working on it. Who's in charge, Billy Rolfe? What's that mean? Malloy's girl is in the booby hatch. My nose is twitching, that's what. An ex-con kills a coloured fella in self-defence, you wash your hands. Suddenly you want to get him. Come on, Nulty, level with me. I don't expect that crooked son of a bitch to level, but you! We're police and you're a private dick. We could take your license. Remember that! I'll tie a string around my finger. Oh, jeez, Marlowe. Call me when he gets in touch. 'I started to think of ways I could tell Moose about Velma, 'but none of them were any good. 'I forced myself to think of my new client, Marriott. 'And I knew one thing: as soon as someone says you didn't need a gun, 'you'd better take one along that worked. 'I was having some Chinese food when a dark shadow fell on my chop suey.' You found my Velma yet? Yeah, I found her. Where is she? Moose, I'm sorry, I really am, but... She's dead? She might as well be. She's in Camarillo... and she ain't coming out. - You're lying. - I wish I was. It's somebody else. It's Velma. I told you it was somebody else. I want you to find my Velma. You mean that's not her? No more funny stuff, huh? Hey Moose, wait a minute... Is there something... 'Why had Tommy Ray given me a phoney picture? I wanted to find out.' He ain't been here all day. It's just not like him. Is my daddy comin' back? 'I was bailing out some rich dame's necklace. 'but I couldn't get that kid's face out of my mind. 'I stopped twice to find out if Tommy Ray had returned. 'He hadn't.' Here's your fee and the 15,000 we discussed. Right. We're to make the exchange at the barrier at the bottom of the canyon. OK. You hop in the back. Get down out of sight. They may be watching all the way. This car sticks out like spats at an Iowa picnic. Well, there's the barrier. Aren't they here? Shh! Get down. Keep quiet. Looks like a try-out to see if you'll obey orders. That can't be. - I'm going to take a look around. - No! Don't you want your $100's worth? - They said stay near the car. - I'm not going far. (Rolling waves ) (Thump ) (Thump ) (Rolfe ) Why'd he come to you? He got my name out of the telephone book. - Think we believe that? - Found your card on him. They're free with bubble gum. You left your car on Beach Road? Why was it at Marriott's? - Obviously somebody drove it there. - What happened to the $15,000? I bought Defence Bonds. Let's start again, huh? From the beginning. Why don't I make it easy on us and tell you what you want? This fairy hired me to exchange a necklace for cash. We drove to the woods, I shot him, buried the $15,000, drove to his place, walked 15 miles back, knocked myself out and called the police. - We could book you now. - Go ahead. What do you THINK happened? Marriott wanted the money and figured me for the fall guy. (Rolfe ) Yeah, then killed himself. He had an accomplice who was to knock us out and take the money. Instead, he killed Marriott, not me, cos he figured you'd fit me into the frame. It fits the facts. It's a theory, anyway. Lieutenant, the Commissioner wants to see you. Bring him in my office. You're in over your head this time, Marlowe. Maybe so. If I am, what are you going to charge me to fix it? I don't think I can, Marlowe. Even if I wanted to. You can go now. We'll find out more about Marriott before we need you. And forget about Malloy. What do you mean? He's lammed to Mexico. - Who says? - The Commissioner. Well, now... I said lay off the case! That's a little more like it. Right on the line. No more of that lammed to Mexico bullshit. How come Nulty? Why? Get outta here, Marlowe. And remember, I warned you. 'It didn't matter you were going to look into Marriott's murder, Nulty. 'I still had a job to do. 'Marriott hired me to protect him, I let him down. 'As far as I was concerned, I was still working for him. 'Most of the fences I knew 'wanted to smell my breath when I mentioned Fei Tsui jade, 'but one sent me to a joint in Chinatown.' (Speaks Chinese ) Yes? Fei Tsui jade. - You got? - No. I no got. I want. - Everybody want. - Who got? Only big collector got. - Who? - Grayle. Baxter Wilson Grayle? He got. Thanks. 'Judge Baxter Wilson Grayle, 'the most powerful political figure in LA for a quarter of a century. 'His butler kept saying the judge was unavailable, 'until I said I was the last person to see Lindsay Marriott alive. 'The house wasn't much, it was smaller than Buckingham Palace 'and had fewer windows than the Chrysler Building.' Mr Marlowe. Come this way, please. Thank you. Hello, Mr Marlowe. Hello. 'Her hair was the colour of gold in old paintings. 'She had a full set of curves which nobody had been able to improve on. 'She was giving me the kinda look I could feel in my hip pocket.' This is my husband, Judge Grayle, Mr Marlowe. Please sit down, Mr Marlowe. Mix Mr Marlowe a drink, Nelson. Yes, ma'am. - You're not what I expected. - In what way? The last person to see poor Lindsay, I thought would be a friend. - If you know what I mean. - He just asked me to tag along. He had to ransom a Fei Tsui jade necklace stolen from a friend. - Thank you. - That'll be all, Nelson. I'm a private detective. I understand you, ah...collect Fei Tsui jade, Mr Grayle? I have a very fine collection, but nothing's been stolen. (Marlowe ) He said it was from a woman. I wonder what he had in mind. We only have one necklace. - Oh, priceless? - Mm-hm. You don't have to bother with this, honey. You should get some rest. I think I will go lie down a while. Glad to have met you, Mr Marlowe. Thank you, sir. Mr Grayle hasn't been feeling well for some time. He tires easily. Hell, I like drinking. Was he an old friend, Mr Marriott? Sort of. He accompanied me places. Well, Lindsay had to tell me something to get me to go along. You're a very good-looking man to be in this kinda business. Well, I hope you don't hold that against me. Poor Lin. He was rather a heel, but to die like that is terrible. - Did you trust him? - Yes. Why? I don't know, I trust some people. I trust you. Why don't you come here and sit beside me? I've been thinking about that for some time. Ever since you first crossed your legs, to be exact. These damn things are always up around your neck. Do you do this sort of thing often? No, I'm usually pretty busy... at the monastery, praying with the other monks. How long did you know Marriott? Oh, years. I liked him. I'd like to know who killed him. Would you find out? I'll pay you, of course. A lot. - A lot? - Mm-hm. Marriott lived like he had a lot. He wasn't borrowing from you, was he? You're a little old-fashioned, aren't you? Your name's Phil, isn't it? Philip, what's yours? Helen, kiss me. (Door opens ) Who was that? - That was Mr Grayle. - Forget him. I'm trying to. He understands. What the hell can he expect? I know, he tires easily. I tell you, it's all right. He's a sick man. You'd never know from the muscle he carries in this town. That kind of muscle you can use from a wheelchair. - Where can I call you? - I'm in the telephone book. - What's wrong? - There's nothing wrong. Oh, jeez, you are old-fashioned, aren't you? From the waist up. 'After I'd parked my car and started for my office, 'I realised I'd forgotten to tune in the news. 'The Yankees were in Washington against the Senators. 'DiMaggio would break the record if he hit in both games. 'I couldn't wait to get to my radio.' Howdy. Howdy. 'I thought I recognised the smile, 'but I knew there was nothing I could do about it. 'This phone kept ringing. It was driving me nuts. 'I prayed someone would answer it. 'I didn't realise it was ringing inside my head.' Where you want him? Sit him down, sit him over there. 'I'd once seen a photo of Francis Amthor, LA's famous madam. 'And there she was...in the flesh.' Hey. Did I deliver, huh? Go on, honey. OK, girls. Nice to meet you, Mr Marlowe. I'm so glad you could make it. Nice to have a night out with the boys. Please, don't smoke, Mr Marlowe. I don't like it. Honey, go on to your room. I just wanna speak to Moose Malloy. I'm only gonna ask you once. I told you. I don't like smoke. Who told you to get up? I think you're a very stupid person. You look stupid, you're in a stupid business and you're on a stupid case. I get it, I'm stupid. You shouldn't have done that, Marlowe. (Evil cackling) (Cackling echoes ) 'The room was full of smoke. 'The smoke hung straight up in the air in thin lines. 'Straight up and down like a curtain of small, clear beads. 'It didn't dissolve, didn't float off, didn't move. 'It was a grey web, woven by a thousand spiders. 'I wondered how they'd got them to work together. '''OK, Marlowe'', I said. ''You're a tough guy. Six feet of iron man. '''190 pounds stripped and with your face washed. '''Hard muscles and no glass jaw. You can take it. '''You've been sat down twice. '''You've been shot full of hop '''until you're as crazy as two waltzing mice. '''Now what does all that amount to? Routine. '''Now let's see you do something really tough, like gettin' up.'' 'I crawled along the floor, thinking: '''How the hell can I get under that door?'' 'I sensed somebody else in the room. 'I wished it was part of my nightmare, but it wasn't. 'It was Tommy Ray. He'd never blow another horn. 'I was torn between making myself walk 'and wanting to lie down on the bed. 'It was a lovely bed. It was made of rose leaves. 'It was the most beautiful bed in the world. 'They'd got it from Carole Lombard. It was too soft for her. 'I was still fighting it, though, still walking. 'Then some footsteps I heard made up my mind for me. 'I had to get back into bed, like it or not. 'I decided to play dead. I didn't have to be a hell of an actor.' (Keys rattle ) Come on, hillbilly, rise and shine. Come on, Amthor wants you. Hey, you ain't croaked, are you? 'If I had any sense, I would've tried to get out of there. 'But sometimes I'm short on sense. 'All I could think of was getting my hands on Francis Amthor. 'It was an old house, 'built as they don't build them any more. 'Fitting and proper for housing the oldest profession.' (Sobbing) (Girl laughs ) Uh-huh. No, no. That buzzer's no good tonight. I put one of your boys to sleep. You've been a very sick man, sir. I can't recommend you being up and around yet. I may look sick, but don't let that fool you. I'm in a rare mood tonight. I can hear the banshees calling. I haven't shot anybody in a month. Whisky? Nah, you first. I've run out of trust in this joint. To your health, sir. What remains of it. I had a nightmare. Silly idea, I dreamt I was shot full of dope and locked up in a room. They knocked me on the head and took me some place where they did that to me. I vaguely remember somebody asking about Moose Malloy. You were saying? I made no remark. What's so important about Malloy? Why was Marriott killed? What's the matter? Cathouse got your tongue? What the hell is it about Malloy? Look, this is a gun. (Laughs ) When you got a gun on you, you're supposed to do what you're told. Not when you're about ready to collapse. (Evil laugh) What is it? What? Tell me, come on. What do you want? Johnny's with your Doris. Wait a minute, where do you think... Stop! You goddamned tramp! (Girl screams ) What have you done to me! (Doris screaming) (Girl) Move it, move it. Let's go! (2nd girl) Where's my robe? 'I had only one place to go, Nulty. 'And I prayed to God that I could make it. (Knocking) (Marlowe knocks ) Georgie! Jeez! You look like you went 10 rounds with Joe Louis. - Did DiMaggio do it? - Sure. Thanks, Georgie. Ha! Ha! Thanks, Georgie. So long, Mr Marlowe. 'I went back to my office after a week, 'after the toughest few minutes of my life, 'telling Tommy Ray's wife she was a widow, 'and the kid that his daddy was gone forever. 'But DiMaggio was still going strong...on his own record, now. 'Would he hit safely in every game forever? It seemed that way. 'And why not? He was only 26 and playing baseball in the sunshine. 'He heard little boys cheer... not cry.' (Phone rings ) Hello. It's me. I began to think you'd won the Irish sweepstakes and took off. Ha! What else were you thinking? - Thinking about tonight. - What about tonight? The White Orchid. There's a private party honouring my husband. This is an election year. I can't very well get out of it. Why don't you meet me there around nine? You're on. Nine o'clock. Bye. (Slow cabaret music) (Inaudible ) A bourbon on the rocks and a scotch on the rocks. You're right on time. Your husband has a lot of friends. Well, everyone in politics does... enemies too. What about Burnette? Is he friend or foe? Friend. He owns this club. - Do you know Laird? - Yeah. A lot of us in the DA's office thought of him as a hood. - And the DA? - He thought I oughta leave. How did you meet? He owns a top-rate gambling boat off-limits. I think Baxter helped him straighten out a problem with the water taxis. Mr Burnette would like a word with you, Mr Marlowe. It's important. Go on, Philip. I'll be back. Nice to see you, Marlowe. You look good. You're cute, too. We go back a long way. To the time you wanted to see me spanked. - I still do. - What for? All I do is run towns, elect judges and mayors, corrupt police, peddle dope, ice old ladies with pearls. Well, you're mixing with some pretty fancy people now, aren't you? Well, yeah... You're not doing so bad yourself. You're the first guy I've seen with Judge Grayle's wife who wasn't... About that guy, Marriott, did you know him well?. She's the one who gambles, he just tagged along. OK, what's so important? I need a little help. You ever do a job, no questions asked? There's always one question. How much? Fine. Two grand. Two grand! What for? I wanna talk to Moose Malloy. Hah! I don't blame you. He's so gay, witty and charming. What's the matter? Can't your boys find him? No. The police can't either. I have friends, Marlowe. That's how I know Moose is your client. I've only seen him twice. That's more than anybody else. Two thousand dollars? It's gotta be some talk. If you're worried about his health, you can be there. How nice. As a mediator, or to stop the bleeding? Buy yourself a new suit, Marlowe. - Mrs Grayle. - Hello, Laird. I'll be on my boat. - I'll see you... - Sooner the better, Marlowe. Where to? - To my place? - What for? We've got everything we need with you. 'She was incredibly beautiful. And she was something, Nulty, 'really something. 'I had no intention of letting Moose in a room with Burnette, 'but there was something going on. What? 'Taking the money was the best way to keep in.' (Gunshot) (Squealing tyres and another shot) 'Two close misses. He had to be real good to do that. 'Good enough to hit... if you wanted to. 'Somebody put a show on for me. 'Why? 'My car was being fixed when I got the call from Mrs Florian. 'It was Sunday and I'd been hanging around hoping to hear from Moose. 'I suggested we talk on the phone... Stupid! 'You can't pour bourbon on the phone.' Thanks. Where you been? I've been tryin' to reach you for days. I've been sick. In a hospital?. Yeah. Pet hospital. Hey, take it easy on me, will you? Your friend, ah...Tommy Ray... he got killed. What?! My God! Why? You know...he gave me a phoney picture of Velma. I been in touch with Velma. How'd you find her? Through the grapevine. Sure it was her? Honey, I never forget a voice. OK, the next time you talk... She won't talk to no one but Moose. I'd like to talk to him. It's been two weeks. What'll I tell her? (Sighs ) She call every day? Same time? Don't let on to the Moose it was me tipped you off. No, no. Look... the next time he gets in touch, I'll call you, give you his number. So she can call him direct, right? - Don't go so soon. - I've got to, honey. Let me have a rain check. 'I was followed for the next couple of days, but it didn't bother me. 'I knew I was safe while nobody found the Moose. 'As long as he breathed, I breathed.' Hey, Georgie. Keep an eye on that car. Tell me if you see it again. (Ringing, door slams ) - Hello? - This is Moose Malloy. Remember? Remember(? ) Yeah, somewhat(!) Where you been hiding? Where nobody found me. Those are the best places. Listen, Velma wants to talk to you. You found my Velma? Almost... She'll only talk to you. We have to wait for her call. Where? I could come to you. I wouldn't like that. Well... OK, I'll think of something. Listen, how well do you know Laird Brunette? Never heard of him. How about Baxter Wilson Grayle? - How many people is that? - One. I never heard of him. I just thought of a place. 'I called Mrs Florian, left Georgie's number, 'now it was up to Velma. 'I had lots of questions for Moose, but he had one thing on his mind.' Why don't she call?. How the hell do I know? You said my Velma would call. I've been slapped, scratched, punched, knocked unconscious, drugged and shot at looking for Velma... so quit tryin' to make a milkshake out of my insides. Stop it! (Phone ) Hello? 'It only took a second to know who it was, 'you could see the seven years inside melting off him.' Hiya, babe. (Sighs ) It's been a long time. I got it. Yeah. Here. Pay me back when you can. Come on, I'll drop you off. Thanks. See you later, Georgie. So long, Mr Marlowe. 'It was one of those transient motels, 'something between a fleabag and a dive. 'I felt like seeing Velma myself, 'but this was a real moment for the big guy, 'and three would be a crowd. 'If ever anything didn't belong... 'that car in the alley was it.' (Marlowe ) Moose! Get down! Phew! 'I'd hit them, but I didn't know if they were dead or alive. 'But that didn't stop Moose. He was checking for his Velma.' You were set up, Moose. Don't you understand? She said she'd be here. Who's tryin' to get to you, Moose? What's goin' on? Was there somebody else in the robbery? Are they tryin' to shut you up, or what? They must have my Velma somewhere. Who? Moose, tell me, WHO? 'He showed his appreciation in his usual, gentle manner.' Supposed to call me when he got in touch, remember? The Commissioner told me lay off, remember? Don't be such a wise-ass. We could charge you with three murders. Recognise him? No, why don't you ask Marlowe? I bet there's not a state they're not wanted in. You're like a slot machine, Marlowe. You'll do anything for six bits. What's his girl's name? - Velma. - Think they got to her? - Could be. - How? Come on. (Dancehall music) (Music blares ) Jessie? Jessie? (Music stops ) (Nulty ) Jesus, what a way to live. Maybe she beat it. This is the kind of place Jessie Florian beats it to, Nulty. This is all she's got. (Nulty ) Look at those neck bruises. You look at 'em. Jeez, what a way to die. Marlowe. Marlowe! This card which you found on Marriott's body. It's the same one I gave to Jessie Florian. Then they knew each other. Moose got in touch last night. He's worried about Velma, wanted to talk. - You get anything from him? - Not much. I figure they called Mrs Florian after they missed killing Moose. Who are they? Whoever THEY are, they knew he'd go to Mrs Florian's looking for Velma. So they gave her a new radio, a couple of bottles, she came cheap. They asked her to call when Moose showed up. Only I showed up instead. (Sighs ) But... she made the call anyway. They got Tommy Ray to give me a phoney picture to keep me busy. They got Velma to call Moose. They might've been holding Velma since Moose got out. Why? You don't think anybody else's voice would've got Moose to that motel?. That was the end of Tommy Ray and Mrs Florian. Probably Velma herself's pushing up daisies now. Why are you telling me all this? Because I'm going out on that boat with Malloy. I don't think I'm coming back alive without the cops. If I went on that boat I'd get busted. At least you're honest about it. An honest cop. I'm supposed to bring you in! If I let you go... If, Marlowe... I'd be sticking my neck WAY out. Thanks, Nulty, but that's not what I need. What I need is another drink. I need a lotta life insurance, a home in the country! I need a vacation! I'm tired! Everything I touch turns to shit! I've got a hat, a coat and a gun, that's it. We've known each other a long time, Nulty. You've got to let me go or Tommy Ray's kid will haunt me for life for letting them kill his old man. He will, you know. Does Burnette know you're coming? Not unless you tell him. Give me five minutes to start back to town, then do anything you want. Hey, Nulty, - Thanks. - Sure. 'I had Moose meet me at a penny arcade outside the hotel. 'Then we went to meet Georgie who'd got us a boat.' I think I found a boat for you. I didn't tell 'em anything, Mr Marlowe. Where's the boat, Georgie? Out there. Can you get us aboard the Lido? The water taxis will take you. I don't like taxis. I'll take you for a good enough reason. How much is the reason? $50, $10 extra if you bleed in my boat. See you later, Georgie. Let's go. 'Marriott dead, Mrs Florian dead, Tommy Ray dead, Francis Amthor dead. 'Only Burnette, with his $2,000 wish to see Moose, was left. 'The answer had to be on that boat.' Turn around, we're going on the boat. Pull over, Hank. Stop the car. (Rolfe ) Are you crazy? Seven people are dead, Rolfe, SEVEN! And the police are driving away. You're talkin' about Burnette's boat, we gotta tell him. - Marlowe's not worth... - Not worth what? Missing our weekly pick-up? Who would you turn back for? Your father, mother, wife or kids? Or is Brunette the only one? Look, I'm outta here. You've got a little too much religion for me. Anybody else want to get out? Don't try to warn anyone. If you do and we get out of this, you're dead. Come on, Hank. Turn on that siren. This is a police car. (Siren and squeal of tyres ) What are you doing down here? (Jazz plays in distance ) (Groans ) Ahh! You gonna take us to Burnette now? Burnette's in San Diego. Whoa! Now would you take us? OK, put me down, I'll take you. (Jazz plays ) Tell him to open the door. Hey, boss, it's me, Nick, open up. Boss? Are you in there, boss? No. I fell overboard. It's me, Nicky! It's important. What's so important? Ahh! Just keep the body where we can see it, Burnette. You want to see me? What do you have in mind, Burnette? You gonna run Moose for Mayor? Or tell him why you tried to drill him after he spoke to Velma? - You know where Velma is? - I don't know any Velma. I'd stop lyin'. Keep away from me, Marlowe. You'd better start talkin', fast. You can come out now, Mrs Grayle, you're missing all the fun. Helen, come on out. Come on out, Helen. (Door) Hi, babe. Long time no see. (Sighs ) You're looking great, babe. Hello, Moose. Well, hooray (!) Now it all makes sense, everything. Velma from the gutter, whore from Amthor's. Take away his gun, honey, and we can go. (Marlowe ) Don't you understand? Prostitute marries millionaire judge. Knows nothing about her background, not even that she was in a robbery and let her boyfriend take the rap. I've got the eighty thousand, Moose, just like I said. She's lying, Moose. She and Burnette cooked up the whole thing. Only two other people knew who she had married, Amthor and Marriott. They're both dead. Amthor told Burnette one of her girls married a judge, that was enough. Everything was hunky-dory, Moose, till now. Take his gun, honey. After they'd missed killing you on the street... Hold it right there, Moose. They sent me and Marriott on some cock-and-bull story and killed him because they were afraid he'd crack. Shut him up, Moose. He's making it all up. Moose, even a band leader for Christ's sake, a friend of hers, he got wiped out! Don't you see, Moose? She's using everybody! (Gunshots ) Why? OK, dragon-lady, who's next? (Knocking) Hey, boss, are you in there? (Knocking) It's me, Mickey and the boys. We're out here! You OK, boss? You'll never get off this boat alive. Hold it, police! Open up, Marlowe. It's me, Nulty. 'Moose never would've hurt her. 'It didn't matter to him she hadn't written in six years. 'It didn't matter that she turned him in for a reward. 'The big lug loved her. 'And if he was still alive, 'it wouldn't matter that she'd pumped three bullets into him. 'What a world.' (Nulty knocking) Come on, Marlowe, open up, it's me, Snow White. Let him in. (Door) You're a hero, Nulty. Headlines. This is no misdemeanour, like a coloured killing. You'll probably wind up being Commissioner. What happened? Let him tell you, I'm too tired. 'Bagby and Smith, 'a couple of run-of-the-mill pitchers, stopped DiMaggio. 'Maybe they had a little extra last night. Like Nulty had tonight. 'I had two grand inside my breast pocket that needed a home. 'And I knew just the place.' by European Captioning Institute.
