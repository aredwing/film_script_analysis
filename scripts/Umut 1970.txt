Gentlemen, second cart is leaving now. - Need a cart? - No. - How much to Priest's Garden? - 3 lira. - That's too much. - So What would you pay? - 75 kurus. - That's too little for Priest's Garden. - What's your final offer? - 75 kurus. Piss off. I'll take you there for two and a half lira. The Horse dealer came, they couldn't find you. He says, if you don't pay in 3 days, he'll take the horse back. The grocer wants his money too. Uncle Osman asks if we'll go to pick cotton. Cemile has an exam tomorrow. She needs shoes. Could we give her one and a half lira as pocket money? That's all what I've earned. Cumali, get us two cups of tea. God. How could you put the dog in wash basin? - Your debt is getting high. - He works hard but earns nothing. He should change his carriage. It's very old. Tell him to pay his debt in 2 days. - Let me ride too. - Piss off. Mum. - Has your father gone? - Yes. The wide streets are forbidden. We must get our rights... What luck? Not a penny in 10 years. - Check it once more. - I did. Nothing. Let's check the list. Maybe there's a mistake the paper. In gaol I met a man who was very interested in the lottery. It's not a hobby for me, it's a hope. I have a lot of debts. I earn 15 lira daily. I've debts to pay, a family to look after. If you minded what I say, you wouldn't have to worry. It's a fantasy. You don't find treasure by praying. Look, brother, underneath the earth is full of gold. - 2 sacks of bran. - Give him 2 sacks. Your debt is getting high. Business is quiet. The carriage is old. I can just feed my family. You owe 95 lira. Over 100, I won't give anymore. - You're in deep thought, Hasan. - He dreams of treasure. Fine. Have fun. Under the earth there are antiques, gold. People got money. Rob them in darkness. We are not robbers. - Finished, Cabbar. - How much? - 15 lira would be enough. - Do I earn 15 lira a day? Materials cost 12 lira. - Here's, 5 lira. I'll pay the rest later. - You already owe me 45 lira. - Did I deny my debts? - Don't get angry, I was just saying. Leave me alone. Take your hands off. Mehmet Emin, let's go. - Give me some melon. - No. - Give me some. - No. Cumali, what's that. Will you work on it 2 hours? Wrong. We asked your height not your age. - What's your father's job? - Coachman. How many brothers or sisters do you have? Five, teacher. Cemile hasn't studied. What shall we do with you? - Let's ask another question. - Yes. - Hello. - Hello, Hasan. How are you? - How are you Cabbar, brother? - Not bad. Is it true that the State would abolish the horse carts? Maybe the old ones like mine. The new ones will be allowed. A good horse and a good cart means money, brother. When you have money, you eat well, sleep in fine beds. ...drink fine wine. When you have money, you are strong. You can have family. If you don't have money, you are the most wretched person in the world. If you have money, you're not cold in winter, without money, you're cold in summer, because money keeps you warm. You don't have money. Your horses will starve. I found a Hodja. He's like a saint. With his prayers... ...we can easily find the treasure. But we need money. If we had 500 lira, we'd be rich in 10 days. - You've lost your mind. - It's not a dream, it's a fact. But I've no money. Someday you'll be surprised... ...to see me like a Pascha. A pack of cigarettes and a box of matches. My carriage! See what you've done. The paint-job is ruined. You kill my horse and talk about paint? Police! Police! What have you typed? It was aproaching evening. I parked my cart and went to buy cigarettes. Being alone the horses got scared. A cyclist came. To avoid hitting the cyclist... Shut up. These carts cause all the accidents. - Just a minute... - Shut up. It's not your fault... ...it's the state's fault. They should've abolished carts. But my horse died. Well, if you leave the cart alone... Was it in a parking space? No... it was shady. You don't put your cart on every shady spot. Shut up. The man's car is ruined. You caused the accident... ...by leaving your cart alone. You attacked him. You're guilty for all. - My horse died. - Still talking. Take him out. Shut the fuck up. Take it down. - What will you do now, Cabbar? - I don't know. - Why don't you go to Mr. Seyfi? - You worked 9 years for him. Maybe he'll help-out. - Will he? - Yeah. Last night my horse died. - Where is she? - Over there. - It took awhile. - His horse has died, asking for money. You want a drink? You just played. A bus has run over Cabbar's horse. - The one we gave? - Right, father. Cabbar owes us 900 lira. He can't pay the money. - Send word, see what he says. - He can't pay it. Cabbar's horse has died. Kazim will get the other one. He owes me 93 lira. Cabbar can't pay his debt without his horse. If he can't pay, You know what to do. My horse died, Sir. I could manage if I bought a new one. Otherwise my family will starve. I'm sorry, I can't afford it. What does the man say? - His horse has died, he needs money. - It's none of our business. He owes us 55 lira. Go to him and get the money. - What's up, what do you want? - My horse has died. I came to you. I could manage if I buy a new one. Your horse is none of my business. Did I tell you... to move to the town? All town horses die. Get going, the town will feed you. What can I get from him? You can take his daughter. My horse died, Uncle Hamit. I went to everyone whom... ...I worked for. No one lends money. You're my last hope. Business isn't good. My horse works at sand. The horse of that cart died. I couldn't replace it. You can do sand-work. - Go, buy salt. - Let's go together. - Let's buy a melon. - There isn't enough money. Bicycle. Take one of those. - Easy. It's my turn now. - Okay, ride it. - You bastard. - Mum, don't. I wish you were dead. I'll kill you if I catch you. Mum, I won't do it again. Please, I promise. Grandma, father. Don't, mother. I wish I was dead and rid of you all. - Why's the boy crying? - I gave him money to buy salt. & the bastard spent the money on a bicycle ride. Come on, son. Did mother beat you? I'll beat her too. You keep spoiling them. As a father you never beat them. I'm miserable because of them. I wish I was dead. Go, ride the bike. And 25 kurus to buy salt. He'll ride the bike! Give me the money. If you ride the bike again, I'll break your legs. Give me the money, I said. Don't spoil the kids. You'll go, I'll have to tolerate... ...them. I'm sick and tired. I'll leave the house. They make me miserable. I wish the same on them. Don't curse. We've got enough trouble already. - I wish them all dead. - Don't curse. - I will. - You'll die instead of the kids. I wish all of you dead so I'd be rid of you all. - Enough, don't make me mad. - What if you're mad? - Shut up. - I won't. I hope you break your hands. Move, girl. Shut up. Let's go to buy salt. We could ride the bike. Mother beats us. She can't. Then father beats her. - What about your exam? - They'll tell me tomorrow. Shut up. Number 238239 one million, Number 140413200,000 lira... Last 3 numbers 109,392, 504 won 200 lira. - Nothing for my ticket? - Nothing, Dad. Children, come & eat. Come on, food's ready. Eat your food. I would sell the cart and the horse. They won't pay much. We can't even pay our debts. If I could buy a horse, I could earn our bread. The cart is old, no one wants to take it. I've got an idea. I could sell our things that are worth selling... ...then I could buy a horse. As you wish. A coachman can't pay his debts, if his horse is dead.. What will Cabbar do now? He can't buy a new horse. Let's sell his cart and horse and share the money. Cabbar owes all of us. - 80 lira for the gun. - I won't sell it. - 100 lira. - I won't sell it. - 120 lira. - No. Take your gun and go. Don't hit me. I won't do it again. Burn some cotton, I'll make her smell it, it may help. - Where is the cart and horse? - They took them away. - Who? - The creditors. - I want 950 lira. - He owes me 180 lira. - 98 for me. - 55 lira for me. - I'll pay 1000 lira. - Sell it. How can sell my cart and horse? If you'd paid your debts, we wouldn't. Your fatherworks hard to pay for your schooling. And you fail. We don't buy food but buy books for you. The same as your ticket. - May I have some wine? - Help yourself. I feel uneasy. I talked to the Hodja. If we had money. Why don't we sell your cart and horse? The treasure is between two bridges on Ceyhan River. I've got nothing but a gun. They won't pay much for it. A gun? This gun can save our lives. We can rob a rich man. - That's crazy. - Think about it. If I had a gun like yours. I wouldn't hesitate for a moment. - They'll catch us. - Who? If I go to gaol, my family starves. Who'll catch us? We'll go to rich people. They've always got money. When you pull the gun... ...you'll scare the shit out of them. I've no bullets. You don't need any. Just show the gun and they surrender Just say yes. We find Hodja Hseyin. His breath is strong. In one week we find the treasure. Then you can... ...buy a cart, two horses. I can get a woman. If you say yes, our lives will be saved. Hasan, brother, let's forget it. God. Don't move. Give us your money. He's got a gun. This man is a foreigner. Give us all your money! Money, I said. Don't you understand? - Didn't you sleep? - I waited for you. - Are you hungry? - No. What happened to your face? Did you have a fight? Didn't you sell the gun? Our movement is to get our rights. We get them if we... ...stick together. They keep closing the doors to our... ...bread. And we keep fighting with it. We'll continue... ...our fight till we get our rights. Unity is strength. Let's stick together. They want to... ...abolish horse-carts but they don't care for us. Attention please. In our country, many people are... ...without work. Forbidding carts, they'll put us among them. - Did you see Cabbar? - He just walked away. - Aren't you joining us? - My cart is sold. I'll join with a flag. Bayram's horse is dead too. He can't join us. Good luck for us all. - Would 340 lira be enough? - 340 lira? - Would it be enough? - Really? Have you got the money? - I have. - We must find Hseyin Hodja. The treasure is bay Ceyhan River, between bridges. - But I don't know where. - Does Hodja know? He has demons, fairies, angels. He tells us right away. I often intended to do this, but I didn't have enough money. - What if we can't find it? - This Hodja is different. We didn't have enough to eat and you brought them here. It's 3 days now and he keeps praying. Hodja knows what he's doing. He called all... ...demons and fairies. He's expecting information. If the treasure is deep under the earth, it's hard to find. Look carefully, tell me what you see in the water. Tell me what you see in the water? Thanks. Why are you crying, son? Just tell me what you see. Stop crying. Stop it. - See what you've done. - Shut up, go away now. - What is going on, brother? - Devil hinders it. Devil scared the kid so he can't see where treasure is. Really? You see a tree? A dead tree with branches? - A dead tree, son? - I don't see anything. Look carefully. You'll see a tree, with two stones under it. A white stone and a black one. A white spot on black stone. The kids may lose their minds. This water business is confusing. Nothing like that. This Hodja cures the insane too. The devil confuses the kid. I see, the kid can't. The treasure is between a white and a black stone. Under a dead tree. There's a river on the right of tree. Right. Ceyhan River is on the right side. - Must the child see it? - He must. - Hodja wants to make sure. - Don't you see a tree? Go to your mother. If the treasure is between bridges on Ceyhan River. ...let's go there and dig when we see the dead tree. We'll ask the Hodja. If we look into the water, can the devil confuse us? The devil is a queer thing - Hatice could try it. - We'll try. Look carefully into the water. Tell me what you see. - What do you see? - There's zinc. Garlic. - And. - Beads. - And? - A horse-shoe. - And what? - A baby shoe. A baby shoe? Don't look around. Look at the water. Could that treasure be so near us? - Near us? - Yeah. I mean near the house. No, I'm sure. The treasure is between the bridges. Really. My God. What are you doing, Cabbar? Man, the treasure is by Ceyhan River, not here. There, between the two bridges. You sweated, kept digging all night. You caught cold. I wish you were dead. I never had a happy day in 16 years. I know but you'll have happy days. We'll find the treasure. Woman, you'll forget the miserable days then. We'll eat well, have beautiful dresses. We'll buy a nice cart and strong horses. These are all fantasies. - We'll find the treasure. - Till you find it... Hodja, could the treasure be under this garlic? - How are you, son? - I'm alright. - We're leaving tomorrow. - Could we find the place? - We almost found it. - Where? We'll go shopping. We need equipment. Don't get up. I told you, This Hodja knows a lot. Call children, this is our last day. We'll go shopping. We'll have kebab, we'll soon be rich. - Really? - God, you're great. Good thing we bought these bullets. - I think it'll rain. - Rain is good, brings prosperity. Go away. You're eating paper. Waiter, bring us Raki. It'll rain, we must take beds in, we can't sleep outside. Look after the kids. I'll give you 40 lira. Try to manage. I'll be back in 10 days. Then we'll be rich. - So you won't be here 10 days. - We'll be rich in 10 days. I hope so. - It's raining hard. - Good. I'll wake up the friends. So, 10 days. You used to go for months. I'll miss you. I used to go but come back penniless. Now I'll be rich. God... ...a cart and horse. The kids will have money in future. - The children. - Forget the children. Come here. What's up, Hasan? You too, son? The devil got hold of my mind. Nothing but water here. Fill up the pit. We're leaving. - How much is a donkey? - Depends on which you want. We'll take those. - How much? - We'll see, if you want to buy. Give me some water. Wrestling. First prize is 500 lira. - Hasan, this is Ceyhan River? - Right. - Is the treasure around here? - It is. This is Ceyhan River, this is Misis Bridge. This is... ...Ceyhan Bridge. The treasure is between bridges. ...under a dead tree. Under a dead tree. Cabbar, be careful where you walk. We're in the domain of the treasure. This is Misis Bridge. We'll walk along the river. ...toward Ceyhan Bridge. Hodja, we almost reached Ceyhan Bridge. No trees. Cabbar, look at the hill is there a tree? There's nothing here. Hasan, brother, here is a dead tree, a dead tree. Here's the black stone. Where's the white one? No other stone. Wait. Don't get excited. We'll bathe in the river. Then find me 101 white stones. You've to be careful. The treasure can run away... ...in disguise. Like an ant, insect, snake or a bird. If you notice the treasure running away and touch it... ...it becomes gold. It regains its true form. Couldn't you sleep, son? I'm taking care of the treasure, so the demons... ...won't steal it. I left 40 lira for my family. You better sleep, son. We've got a lot of work tomorrow. Buy cheese, olives, grapes, onion and bread. And check if anyone knows about us. Don't worry. - Good morning. - Good morning. Half kilo cheese, half kilo olives, a kilo grapes. ...a kilo onions and 2 watermelons. ...And a bottle of wine. Hodja. Hodja, hurry up. Come and see. This is a stone, son. Could our treasure disguise itself as a stone? Demons can disguise it, as a bird or a snake, but not that. If it becomes a bird, how can we catch it? Can we shoot? If it's a bird and you shoot it, it becomes gold and falls. Good, We must be prepared and keep the gun with us. - Any news? - Cabbar scares me. He found a stone and thought it was the treasure. He has his gun. If treasure is a bird, he'll shoot it. Hodja, could the poor man loose his mind? - Where have you been? - They paid 40 lira for the donkeys. There was nothing but bread in the village. What happened? Water, just water. It's almost a month. I left 40 lira at home. They must be starving. - Poor man is insane. - He'll be sane when we find the treasure. - What's going to happen? - God will helps us some day. The treasure is running away. The treasure. The treasure. I caught it. But it's not the treasure. It's a snake. - Cabbar, pull yourself together. - Cabbar, calm down. Cabbar, calm down. The snake means luck, good news. Go to the river, take a bath. We'll find the treasure. The treasure is near us. We'll find it. We must find it. I left 40 lira for my family. The kids must be starving. They must be waiting for us. Be purified in your heart so you can be near God. Even if the treasure is 7 layers under the earth... ...we'll find it put your purified soul in the hands... ...of God's angels. The treasure will pull you to itself. Believe in God, take refuge in his benevolence. God won't leave us, He'll be with us. THE END
