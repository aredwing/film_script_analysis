Became candidate for Congress Seduces stupid girls Says he's from Pennsylvania He wants to be a star rather than a prosecutor 15 years of prison A rookie politician Those who were sent to prison by prosecutor Byun Prison family A VIOLENT PROSECUTOR Far East Construction No resort at the bird sanctuary! No resort at the bird sanctuary! Hey. Why are you so late? Sorry, boss. The traffic was bad. Damn bastards! - Hurry. - Yes, sir. - Where the hell are you going? - l hate that bastard... You, beanpole! Yes, you, l asked where you're going! Damn bastard, focus! You think this is a joke? What is wrong with you? He's got asthma, sorry boss. What am l supposed to do with these losers? Damn it. Strike them! Stop the construction! Stop it! Stop the resort construction right now! Stop it right now! Go! Go! Save the bay! If you cross the police line we can arrest you for violating the assembly law. What the hell...? You just violated the law! You just violated the law! Drop your weapon! It's the final warning. It's the final warning. You can be arrested on site. Son of a bitch! You can be arrested on site. You just violated the law! Stop them! Stop them! Don't let them through! Block them! Stop them! They sure do work hard. At the Asan Bay bird sanctuary, where Far East Construction is trying to build its largest resort, there was major bloodshed at 2pm today between police and an environmental NGO. Having occupied the site for over 50 days, 100 environmental activists resisted police enforcement using iron pipes and other weapons Some extreme members acted with illegal violent force turning the bird sanctuary into a lawless area. In the crackdown, combat officer Lee Jae-seung was struck on the head with a blunt weapon and is still unconscious. NGO member Lee Jin-seok who struck the policeman was apprehended by police. So are you going to keep acting up like this? I've told you 100 times, I know nothing about this. You disguised gangsters as environmental activists to turn the protest violent! There's circumstantial evidence that funds from your company went to a gang. Who the hell wants to trap me? - You know l originally??- Hey, Jang Hyun-seok. The bastard who hit the cop's head is coming in soon. A few words with him, and you're done. No point in all this bullshit. Please check these. Prosecutor Byun, are you issuing a ruling before the trial? I'm still an innocent citizen. You know well! How dare you raise your voice? Who's behind you? Nobody's behind me. It's a hard life for everyone. l guess you've been really lucky meeting only generous prosecutors so far. Sir. Haven't you ever thought that your passion might block your path to success? A cornered stone meets the mason's chisel?? What the hell? This is violation of human rights! Violation of human rights? You son of a bitch... Come here. Stand straight. Three years preparing! Four years at college! Four years of cramming for the exam! You know why l slaved 1 1 years to become a prosecutor? To legally kick the ass of gangsters like you! You know that? l know your current situation. But let's not see this as a political matter. Byun has caused lots of problems already. People upstairs have their eye on this. I got your point, sir. DEPUTY CHIEF PROSECUTOR WOO JONG-GIL I will handle the case myself not to cause any inconvenience to the people upstairs. Congressman, it's me, Min-woo. Let me pour you a drink. Oh, I'll pour you the nice stuff. It made me so proud watching you conduct the government offices inspection. Those bastard ministers didn't know a thing. Absolutely. They only took Civil Service Exam. Hey, Byun Jae-wook. What is wrong with you? After all the trouble you caused, you hit a suspect again? I'm sorry, Chief. It was my mistake. Next time, I'll beat him so hard that he'll beg for his life and not bother us anymore. You bastard. You think others don't use violence ?because they can't? We are administers of law. What would happen if we ignore due process? Sometimes... you only can fix bad habits with a beating. Enough. Lee Jin-seok came in today for police assault. Let Yang handle it. No, sir. We have to beat Lee to get Jang, and we have to beat Jang to get those politicians related to the bird sanctuary development. - What is wrong with him? - I'm sorry, sir. We've had a hard time because of him?? Go get some fresh air. We were told to turn over this case to Prosecutor Yang. I said get out! You smashed a cop's head with an iron pipe but the pipe wasn't originally from that site. We were there to protect the environment.. Protect nature? Environmental activism is great. But you know what? After you hit him?? public opinion is now pro-development. Don't you think something smells fishy? It was a mistake that happened in a chaotic situation. Many of us were hit too. - What group do you belong to? - Pardon? You don't even know the name of your organization? Listen, sir. Once migratory birds leave Russia, they keep flying for 15 days without landing or eating... The bird sanctuary is the place where those birds stop by to eat and rest. If we develop this habitat the birds would come and all die. One species of bird will go extinct. You have a good memory. Who wrote that line for you? I knew it myself. Listen, Lee Jin-seok. A middle school graduate turned into an environmental activist? You want me to believe it? So an undereducated ex-convict can't protect nature? Take off your shirt. I don't want to. I said take it off! No, I won't. What is wrong with you? Please! - Stand up. Attention! - Please let me go... Stand straight! Straight! Take off your shirt! Why should l... I said take it off! Look at you, son of a bitch! Look at this nice tattoo on your body! You bastard. You claim to be an activist when you have this big tattoo on your body? You'll never get out of here. I'll search out everyone related to you. Everyone. SUWON DISTRIC PROSECUTORS' OFFICE Hey, wake up. Jae-wook! I told you not to mess with me! What the hell are you talking about? I heard you locked up Lee Jin-seok all day long! Are you trying to screw me? Why are you bothering me so early in the morning? Stop the bullshit and return him to me. I won't stand here and let you screw us over. All right, just let me sleep 5 more mins. I stayed up all night! Damn it. Morning! Where are night shifters? Why is the monitor off? - Bastards??- Don't know. - Get ready quick. - Yes, sir. Hey! Wake up, Mr. Lee! Rise and shine! Let's wrap this up and have breakfast! Lee Jin-seok. Hey you! Lee Jin-seok! Chief Kang! - Answer me! - Yes, sir. What's wrong with him? What happened last night? I don't know??I didn't do the night shift. Call him quick! Hurry! You have the right to remain silent and the right to an attorney. Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law. D.ff. Byun Jae-wook, arrested without warrant for murdering police assault suspect, exits the prosecutor's office. The case relates to a dispute over developing the bird sanctuary?? Shockingly, the prosecutor killed the suspect during his interrogation. Citizens are demanding a transparent and fair investigation into the practices that caused this incident. Dear citizens. As Deputy Chief Prosecutor I sincerely apologize for the foul play of Byun Jae-wook and accept full responsibility for this. Did the defendant directly order the witness to leave the interrogation room? Yes. Prosecutor Byun ordered me himself. The defendant Byun claims that the victim died of asthma-related breathing difficulties. ls it correct? No way. Jin-seok was sound as a bell. Defendant Byun Jae-wook had previously caused trouble both internally and externally with his violent tactics. His mistaken views about governmental power led to this criminal act of assault and homicide, undermining public trust in the prosecution as a whole. To re-establish justice and the rule of law using this case as an example, we hereby ask for 15 years imprisonment. Look at him! You're so screwed, Mr. Prosecutor. Hey Mr. Prosecutor! Lift your damn head up. Remember me? I'm the Iron from Gunsan. Here, sir. The human body is so mysterious. All because of this small object... Take off your shoes. Wow! Look who's here. It's been a while, sir. Never expected to see you like this. Damn, you scared me. Why no answer? At least pretend to listen when people talk to you. I think I gave you 20 years total. First, 3 years for special robbery and then 17 years for murder. Great. Excellent memory! So smart! From Seoul University, right? Let's exchange greetings since we'll be together so long. Of course. Greetings. - You guys give him good greetings. - Let's go. Bastard! - I said 'don't move!' - Hold that son of a bitch. You'll spend your whole life with me! Isn't that nice? Son of a bitch! - You must be damn happy! - Here he comes! Nice. What's all the fuss for? We're exchanging greetings with the newbie. Cool it now and get ready for roll call. Yes, sir. Three, mo, one. One! Three, mo, one. Two! Three, mo, one. Three! Three, mo, one. Four! Three, mo, one. Five! Three, mo, one. Six! Three, mo, one. Seven! Don't stare, you son of a bitch! You think you're a prosecutor in here too? What is it? Let me see. Bring the bandage! The long-delayed development of the Asan Bay Bird Sanctuary resumed today with a groundbreaking ceremony. Alongside President Jang of Far East Construction, Congressman Kang Young-seop and Woo Jong-gil, ex-deputy prosecutor, attended the ceremony. APPLICATION FOR RETRIAL I've worked as a prosecutor for 8 years! Long enough to know if it was a plot. I'm being made a scapegoat to cover up the habitat case! The so-called witnesses are all lying, and Min-woo is acting like a crazy man. It's like everyone wants to bury me alive. - So? - The thing is... I'm absolutely sure that Lee Jin-seok had his inhaler! If we can find it, it would solve this case. Didn't you hear the testimony that he never had asthma? You keep saying the same damn thing! All the evidence points to you as the murderer. Then what do you want me to do? First, plead guilty. Then we'll say the victim acted rashly under interrogation, acted rashly under interrogation, You want me to admit to this? Listen, Jae-wook. This isn't the truth I'm talking about?? - it's the way of the law. - Sir! This is the only way I can get you out of this. Now, the verdict. We recognize the defendant's service to the cause of justice. But his abuse of power leading to the victim's death is too serious a crime to be forgiven. Furthermore, we find no evidence to support the defendant's claim of self-defense. Therefore, believing in the need to raise an alarm over the illegal investigations of the prosecution and police, we find the defendant guilty, and sentence him to 15 years in prison. Chief, this isn't what you told me! What's going on? - Chief! - Jae-wook, stop it! What the hell are you doing to me? Answer me! Let me go, assholes! Tell me why you're doing this to me! Tell me! Let go of me! Woo Jong-gil! Damn it. Tell me the reason! Why did you do this to me! Yes, sir. I'll take care of it myself. Thank you. I'm counting on you. No. 3820. Warden wants to see you. Every man in this jail believes that he's innocent. Rather than upset people upstairs, you'd be better off getting used to it here, okay? APPLICATION FOR RETRIAL It's cold. Let's hurry. Attention! Gather here. Raise your hand if any of you has experience in real estate. What did you do? I was a contractor and illegal real-estate broker. It means you were a con-man! What did you do? The same broker bullshit? I'm sorry, sir. My enthusiasm got the best of me. I'm the idiot for expecting anything out of you. Forget it. Back to work! Not one guy here who can help me. What'll I do? It's quite a big lawsuit, and what do I know about the law? - Captain Im. - Who the hell is this? On the outside, I handled a few real-estate disputes in court. That's right! You're the one! Why didn't I think of you? We have a specialist here. So this would solve everything? - It's that simple? - Yes, sir. Then the other party will be arrested for evasion under property transfer law. So he'll offer you a settlement. Then you get your money back, plus a cancellation fee. May I have one more? Of course, go ahead! Take your time. A while back, I lost a civil suit to my uncle so I need to pay. Yes, right. But as you know well, civil servants like us have no money?? - Don't pay him. - Really? ls it okay not to? The court ordered me to pay. What do those jerks know? I'll settle it for you. In return... could you do me a favor? Really nice, bro. You dance much better than the pros! Nice move! No. 1322, you're transferred. Why all of a sudden? What is it? Wait! What is it? Why are you doing this? At least tell me the reason! Please tell me! Where the hell are you sending me? At least tell me where! Let me go! Damn bastard, let me go! 5 YEARS LATER Welcome! Newbies! Good to meet you! See you inside. Hey, don't stare at me! Left face! March ahead! See you soon. Honey, are you alright? How do you feel? You're okay, right? Why are you saying that? You really don't know why? Honey, don't do this to me! I'm no longer good enough for a sweet girl like you. Forget about an ex-con like me and live a happy life. That's what I came out to say. Honey. I'm done with the visit! Wait, honey! Please! I know you don't belong here. I know it all. The person I know is too pure-hearted - and innocent for this! - Stop it, Hana I'm a fool! All I did in the US was study. I don't know the ways of the world. I believed everything Koreans told me. I think the world misunderstood you. No! What misunderstanding? Don't you see this? The world will never recognize me! Do you think your family will approve a scumbag like me? You're not a scumbag! I can overcome everything. My dad will give me his new building. We can start small with it when you come out, okay? You're unbelievable. How did I ever find a girl like you in this dirty world? Honey. - Get rid of all his gang. - Yes, sir. Hey, what's up, bro? What's up, man? Who was it? I heard a chick visited you. I envy you! - Tell me the secret! - Yeah, tell us! The difference between you guys and me is that you think too much. Fraud is not about cheating others and ruining them. It's leaving yourself behind. It's just making yourself into the person you want to be. Understand? We brought him. Who the hell are they? You don't know? He's the prosecutor in cell #9. Sir... I'm not a criminal. Then what are you? One of my staff raped my daughter. How could a father turn his back on that? Don't look at me when you talk Pardon? So I called in several Yanbian Koreans. So you are a criminal. Sir. I heard quite a lot about him. He's facing big difficulties now. But he has a great reputation. - Tell him to come. - Yes. You can talk to his face now. Please help me, sir. Does the prosecutor have proof that the Yanbian Koreans asked for money? No, sir. Then just find some other Yanbian Koreans and make them testify you didn't order them to kill him. Tell them to commit perjury? The prosecution can't confirm arguments made from China. That's how the system works. If they just testify you didn't order the killing, the sentence will be reduced by 2 years. 2 years? Plus, the court will consider the rape victim's mental anguish. - How long have you been here? - 9 months. 9 months... Congratulations. Only 3 months left. Really? Thank you! How can I express my gratitude? I'll tell you later if I need help. Thank you, sir. Thank you! What's the use of being a big shot in prison? He's just a murderer after all. Attention, everyone! Salute the warden! Hello, sir! At ease. Jae-wook, why are you working? It's my duty to work. The case you mentioned before how did it go? Their lawyer was left speechless. Good to hear. Hey! Thank you sir for the papers. Let's have some coffee. Keep up the good work! Yes, sir! Nice! Hey, here! - Hey, what's up! - What's up! Man! Keep it quiet, okay? Yes, bro. What the hell? Why do people smoke that crap? - You know what, bro? - Tell me. Those migratory birds... Once migratory birds leave Russia, they keep flying for 15 days without landing or eating. You know what, prosecutor? Once migratory birds leave Russia, they keep flying for 15 days without landing or eating... Those birds use that place like a rest area. So they eat, drink, take a rest. Then they fly on to the South Pacific. Where did you hear that? What the... That migratory bird bullshit! Where did you hear it? Are you crazy? Hey! What is it? It's really important to me, so tell me straight. Don't touch, man What's wrong with him? Tell me now, damn it! Mister, I'm from the States and we care a lot about nature. In Pennsylvania, if you pollute, you get the death penalty. You know nothing. I love birds! My favorite, all right? Easy man! Damn son of a bitch... Even if you appeal, you can't win. You'd better serve your sentence. Sign here and let's wrap this up. Anniversary of my father's death is next month. My mother and younger brother need me. I need to work to feed my family. Mr. Han Chi-won, you lied about graduating from Penn State! Sir, they were falling over themselves trying to invest, should I just ignore them? If you see cash lying in the street, do you just say, "Ah, money..." and leave it there? It's true, I'm a materialist. - You're a public defender? - Yes. Which class? The 38th. Oh, you passed a bit late. I'm from 31st class. Oh, it's you... sir. Please sit. I'll take a look at the file. - It's a really simple case. - What is it? Refer to the Supreme Court's precedent of 1998. What do you think you're doing? It sets out legal principles for the causal relationship between fraud and damage. in other words, if there is no clear causal relationship between fraud and damage, charges of fraud cannot be established. Hey, what's man! Hey, hey, what are you doing? What is this crazy bastard saying? You wait here. Sir... Sit down. Mr. Pennsylvania! So, where did you hear the story about the birds? Oh, that? I told you already. Be straight with me. I know you've never been on an airplane in your life and you've been convicted 10 times already for swindling dumb girls. What the hell are you talking about? 9 times. I was acquitted once last year. If your story is the thing I'm looking for, I can get you out of here right away. Just moment. OK! What are you want? Maybe 5 years ago...? I heard I could get paid 100 bucks per day for studying at some kind of service company. Back then I was preparing for my own business?? so I went there to kill time. There were about 20 guys... who spoke well and looked relatively innocent for this field. It was nice to get paid for learning something. But one day they took us somewhere. they took us somewhere. l?ff never hit anyone in my life, so I couldn't do it. I never imagined it would be that brutal. The person who gave you the order was Jang Hyun-seok of Far East Construction. Huh? How do you know his name? Scumbags like you are the ones I hate most. Parasites who exploit others. But this time, even if you don't want to I'll definitely get you out of here. Listen. From now on, you need to face those you fear most. Gangsters. - Come on in. - Yes, sir. Prosecutors. Politicians. Today I leave behind the prosecutor's office to which I dedicated my youth, and start my second life as a politician! Hey, copy that signature! Why should I copy that, all of a sudden? Don't try to learn the details. Just practice signing exactly the same. You'll need it in the future. GO FOR IT! They should get a dryer, damn it. - Hang it there. - Yes. Hey, bro Easter eggs! Crazy bastard. Give those to me. - Give 'em to me! - Why? Just give them! Hey, Young-cheol. Share this with the others. Thank you so much, sir. Guys, let's have some eggs! You're good looking and quite smart. Why'd you become a con-man? You might not know this... I once placed 38th nationwide in a mock SAT. But my father passed away, and I got all his debts. What could I do? Nothing to do except to use this face and brain. From my point of view, are you a bad guy or not? I guess not. Go to hell. Once this is over live your life right!. Yes, understood, bro! Bro? By the way... why does no one come to see you? Guess I was a bad guy on the outside. You must be married. How about kids? You're not? You totally look married! What kind of life did you lead? Gosh! Now, my verdict. Reflecting the Supreme Court's precedent, it is hard to see that the defendant showed a willingness to swindle the victim out of money so there is no case for fraud. So the court revokes the original verdict and declares the defendant not guilty. Congratulations, Chi-won. Sir! I'm going out tomorrow! Happy? Don't smile. What's this? The numbers of the perjurers at my trial 5 years ago. Don't waste your time on useless crap. Focus on the work I give you. Hey... I promise that I will do my best to resolve your pain. You smart ass. Don't overdo it! - Let's get back to work! - Let's get back to work! Let's go! What's next? - Beat it, you're bugging me. - I know you like it. This is why you don't have a wife. I said beat it! Hello, who is it? It's me, Han Chi-won. Han Chi-won? I thought you were dead! What brings you here? Take it slow. Do the bosses not feed you? Guess you're on a roll. You look so nice and shiny. You know I use my brain. - I can't go wrong. - Really? But where are the brainy ones? Busy with the election campaign. Lots of deliveries to make. Guys like us just get chewed out all the time. Sir, I'm thankful for the meal and happy for your success. Please propose a toast. - Stop it. - Please! Give him a big hand! It's embarrassing. Here, to your health and lots of money! Most of all, to life! Cheers! Cheers! He looks handsome! Buddy. Let's toast, after so long. Sure. I heard that Jin-seok died. I was abroad for a long time so couldn't attend his funeral. Stop it! That was ages ago! Madam! 5 more plates! Coming! And I heard that... he was beaten to death by this crazy prosecutor. Hey! Why do you keep talking about the dead? My bad. I'm losing my appetite. I'll try harder, boss. Let's go second round! Second round! - Look. - Why? Think about it. What have you gotten for working your ass off? If this greasy pork gives you a heart attack, then what? I was an athlete in my high school days, and I only weighed 60 kg. But doing my job while eating that fodder?? But at least we should be grateful that we're alive like this. So we can drink together now! Look at Jin-seok. What kind of life is that? Damn poor bastard. He could never even breathe properly. We always teased him. Then... was he sick in the first place? You didn't know? His asthma was really serious! What? Asthma? You knew he had asthma? Sure. Everyone knew about it. Why do you ask? You didn't know? I didn't. How could he... My friend. Let's drink. Can I have one? Thank you. What I mean is... if Jin-seok started to talk bullshit it could've ruined the boss' business. Right. That's what I mean! - So the boss did it to him? - Right. The boss ordered Jin-seok killed. So you're saying it's not the prosecutor who did it. Right? I got it all right. That's why I lied in court. We just did as the boss ordered. Damn that's hot! - Oh! Are you okay? - Are you crazy? You bastard! It turned out really nice! Son of Pohang... To be precise, I'm not from Pohang. Don't say that again! For a politician, your precinct is your hometown. Yes, sir. Oh, Jang. Make it quick. I'm a bit busy now. Sir, have you heard? Heard what? Byun Jae-wook applied for a retrial. I think one of my boys who testified in court I think one of my boys might've said something I'm afraid something could go wrong. Don't talk about this on the phone. Where are you now? Are you out of your minds, you bloody bastards? How long do I have to do this? You sons of bitches! You guys wait outside. - Sir. - Mr. Jang. Since becoming a prosecutor, I developed a daily routine. - You know what it is? - Pardon? Don't know sir. I meditate for an hour every morning. Doing that clears my head and I can see clearly what I couldn't before. You see what? I can see, among those who clean my shit, who will back stab me someday. I'm sorry, sir. Look at you... I turned a reckless moron into a businessman! And you pay me back with this kind of shit? Sir! I understand you are not satisfied but I tried my best for you... Only a month until the election. Let's get it right. And call me often! Yes, sir. We've got the slippery one. Okay. Good job. You wrap it up on your own. What do you mean by wrapping it up? You stupid ass. Whether you scare him into silence, or beat him senseless, I don't care. I just want you to handle it and report me the result! - Understood? - Yes, sir. - Hello, sir! - Long time no see, Min-woo! You've been on the up and up nowadays! You look a bit exhausted. Don't enter politics. It's quite tough. Did something happen? Well... I heard Byun Jae-wook appealed. Pardon? I'm afraid it might stir up gossip right before the election. Why so suddenly? This is perfect timing to put a dent in my career. It's been a while since you met your friend. You go and meet him. The trial can wait?? until the election is over. Wow, you've changed a lot! You grew a beard? Let us talk in private. And I assume it's okay to smoke? Well, yes, sir. Have one. It's hard to get one of these here. I don't know what's on your mind. But if you are trying to raise hay to sabotage us, I warn you to stop. You came all the way to tell me this? You know well there'll be no retrial with one piece of evidence. Wow... Now you talk like a prosecutor. Finally learned how to threaten. Don't be sarcastic. For 20 years since high school I smoked 3 packs a day. But I quit five years ago. My head's never been clearer in my whole life. Take care. Give Woo my best regards. Ruthless bastards?? I'm sorry, pal. Did you convince him to testify? He's all smashed up. He might live the rest of his life half-paralyzed. Damn...you're okay? Wouldn't be talking to you if I were caught. Might be drowned or in pieces at the bottom of some lake. Let's talk more face to face. Come meet me. Sir. I gave it a lot of thought. I think I paid you back for what you've done for me. Please don't call anymore. Hanna told me you mo would like to run a small business. Isn't it too humble for you after all your studies in the States? We can start small first. My folks also started with a small gas station in the US. You went to Penn, right? Yes! I studied business administration. Did you? They don't have that department, at the bottom of some lake. I mean the graduate school. Ah, you went to Wharton? - One of my friends studied there, too. - Is that so? Are you talking about Kyung-min? That's right. He's your age, he must've studied with you. You must know each other. Not many Koreans at that school. Right, Kyung-min, The tall thin guy who's good at basketball. He's not even 170cm. Sorry, I confused him with another friend. Let me see... Kyung-min?? Honey, my brother told me you talk like a person from Gyeongsang Province. Gyeongsang Province? ls it near Busan? I don't really know but some say a Penn accent sounds quite similar to Gyeongsang dialect. Does it? But I should have a chat with him. Calling an American a Gyeongsang hillbilly. Why isn't it moving? Hello? Excuse me. Excuse me. Why are you doing this? I'm sorry. No...not my face! What is it? Oh my god. What are you guys? - Hey! - Who are you anyway? Hands off me! Are you crazy? Listen, Han Chi-won. Shall I tell your chick you're a high school drop-out with nine convictions? You still need to pay him back. You said you won't see me. What brings you here? Hey. See what you've done to a class A masterpiece? Why are you doing this to me? Even if you leave me, Woo will kill you anyway. Are you crazy or what? You think I'm so weak? If you want to live rest of your life on the run, suit yourself. Sir! Hello! Wait a sec! So what do you want me to do? Tell me. You have no other option either. Can I trust you? It's just too hard. It's killing me. I want to get it done ASAP and return home to grow some garlic with my old man. Didn't you say you lost your father in junior high? Did l? I have dedicated 25 years of my life to the law! Now, I will devote myself solely to my hometown, Pohang!

Woo Jong-gil list' with names of 11 big shots Source of campaign funds revealed in bribe book Appeal to dismiss charges against an ex-prosecutor serving time for homicide. This is big. Raising a fuss 5 years later for a case he can't win, it's for manipulating the media, your honor. Listen, Byun Jae-wook. Are you just doing this to cause trouble? Didn't you hear the recorded file submitted as evidence? Please approve a retrial. What I mean is?? why is it now that you're bringing this up? What were you doing back then? The night before the trial someone offered me probation. That's why I pleaded guilty giving false testimony. Who did that? - Woo Jong-gil. - What? What did you just say? Please approve a retrial, sir. I will reveal everything in court. How did it go? The retrial?? was approved. That was the best you could do? I am sorry, sir. No, it's not your fault. And sir... Byun requested you as a witness. Jae-wook?? he must hate me a lot. By the way, sir?? ls there anything between you and Jae-wook that I don't know? What do you mean? What can there be? It's just mean political maneuvering. You just make sure I won't have to appear in court. You can go now. Such a moron?? Warden Kim! How are you? Just letting you know... The Ministry of Justice will inspect your facility next week. I thought I should notify you. Stand by for inspection! Move away. - That is nothing. - Hands off! - Sir, please don't. - Come out, bastard! I said get out! No. 3820! Detention of 30 days for keeping restricted items! Transfer? Why all of a sudden? Officer, please tell me! Sir, they say I'll be transferred! Sir, please do something! - Sir! Sir! - Look ahead! Despite recent allegations of slush funds Candidate Woo Jong-gil of the Creative People's Party is leading by 7O/o in the latest poll. It's me. Listen carefully. Things are not good in here. I won't be able to call you. We should talk. Come in right now. Hey, No. 3820! What are you doing there? Nothing, officer. Just finishing up. Hurry! Go in. The money is ready. This will be our last meeting. Woo is making his moves. You'll be on your own from now on. Let me get this straight. Has anyone ever helped me? Everything??is up to you now. Let's pray for one last time. Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened and I will give you rest. Amen. Amen. The real game is on now. So better not mess it up. Don't waste your time on girls. Press your pin, sir. Matthew 1 1 :28 How much more do you need? Didn't we pick Canada because the tuition's cheaper? Kang was deserted by Woo and has no one to rely on. His only crime was to conceal evidence and the statute of limitations has expired. You can definitely get him with that money. Who is it? Chief Kang, is it? Hello. Who are you? LAW SCHOOL ALUMNI REUNION Seoul District Public Prosecutors' Office. Chief Prosecutor Yang Min-woo He is really distrustful, not easy to approach. But he is very conscious of others. so start from the hot shots near him. Kim Chang-seop, Director of Inspection at Supreme Prosecutors' Office. He likes people and booze. And he's quite careless. He'll be the perfect target to start with. Sir, it was great seeing you the other time. Have we met before? Stop joking, sir. You'll hurt my feelings. I'm sorry. Was it at a seminar? - Yes! - Now I remember. Jeonju District Court head Park Chung-jik. He's married to Hyesung Corp. Hates people from Daegu. Then he kept giving me all this Daegu bullshit?? So I made it very clear that Daegu people are naturally greedy and that's the source of our country's problems. You have sharp insight. I like him better and better. - Thank you, sir. - Let's toast. I have a Chateau Margeaux, present from a client. It'd feel less like a bribe if we share it together. If you reach that far, Min-woo will take the bait. He can't stand being left out from the bunch. I Min-woo wants to be a star not a prosecutor. Hey, Yang. Come here. Should I call you Chief Prosecutor? No, I don't deserve the title quite yet, sir. I just carry the responsibility. You are too humble. This is prosecutor Kim Jae-young from the south branch office. A very smart young man. I'm just humbly following in the footsteps of great figures like you. Listen to this guy talk! How come I didn't met you sooner? Thank you, sir. Introduce yourselves. How do you do, sir. Kim Jae-young. It's an honor to meet you. Yeah?Good to see you. Sir, can I call on your office sometime soon? What? Why? It's important, so I'd rather talk in private. I'm from Hwimoon High, class of 95. - Really? - Yes. - We're high school alumni, too. - At your service, sir. Great, let's keep in touch. Who was your homeroom teacher? The... Snake! - What? Is he still?? - Of course! Can I help you? No, it's okay. What's wrong with this? Excuse me. Prosecutor Kim Jae-young? Yes, I am. How are you, sir? I'm Park from Prosecutor Yang's office. - Great to meet you. - Pleasure. Believe us, counsel, we didn't pocket the book. That college bastard did, tempting our clerk here. - Really? - Tell him, Yuna. What are you doing? Sir? Good morning, sir. Welcome! Take a seat. I found this while investigating Jang Hyun-seok. Seems like his money is flowing to politicians. Are you talking about Woo's slush fund? That slush fund file is just the tip of the iceberg. I looked into the development of the migrant birds' sanctuary. It serves as a gold digging scam for political big shots. Why are you showing this to me? I heard??you're quite close to Candidate Woo. Just get to the point. If this were leaked to the media, it might hurt you too, so I wanted to let you know. Jang and Woo??are also relevant to the Byun Jae-wook case. I want... ?ff,?o be on your side. Didn't know you were such a daredevil! I like it! Sorry to interrupt, sir. - But you need to sign this. - Sure, of course. And you have a morning meeting. Right, I almost forgot. I'll go to this meeting, but let's talk after/wards. No, stay here. I won't be long. Yes, sir! What a cheerful fella. I love you, sir! SUMMONS FOR WITNESS Yes! Where'd he go? He said he'd go to the restroom. And I sent the document to Judge Choi's office, sir. - What document? - It's?? the summons for witness?? He told me you said to send it over. Did l? What are you talking about? What's this about? Yes, boss. Looks like him. No, I won't go! Get out now! Do what I tell you! Chi-won! Honey! Come here. Bro, what is it? Please calm down. You lowlife! I should've guessed it from your lousy English. - Hey! - Don't! How dare you swindle my innocent little sister? Screw Pennsylvania! Speak some English. Cat got your tongue? What's wrong with you? I said I'm fine with it! Are you crazy? RECORD OF CRIMINAL HISTORY If you don't come now I'll have him thrown in jail! You're disgracing the entire family! - Let's go! - I won't! Get out! I love you, Chi-won! - Love him, my ass! - Leave me alone! I don't want to go! Open that door, missy. Open the door! Pretty boy shit Where is that bastard? Hey! Where are you going? To check upstairs. Our guys are already on it. Then downstairs. Alright then. That bastard Han Chi-won, he's dead meat! Long time no see, beanpole. - Is business alright? - Ah, yes. - Thank you for your support. - Yes, yes. I will do my best! Sir. A call from the High Court. You're summoned as a witness. 10 am Wednesday. I see. Hey, Judge Choi. What do you think you're doing? You think you can do this to me? What do you mean? You have the final call on this! What is it? Open the fucking door! Don't you know who I am? Why did you sign it? Do you realize what you did to me? I didn't do it. You stupid idiot. I received this because you signed it! Stop it, will you? What? What did you just say? Say it again. You think I'm blind? I did some research and this is not your only problem. So you're saying, let's go our separate ways? I'll see you in court. Okay, see you there. People never know when their downfall starts. Chief Park! Arrest Jang Hyun-seok of Far East Construction now! Excuse me? On what charges? Why do you have to know? I'll do whatever I need to to get the warrant. So just drag him in, got it? Yes, sir. Please boss! Forgive me this once. You slippery little bastard. You caused so much trouble for so many higher-ups. You know that? I must've been out of my mind. If you forgive me once, I'll do anything you say.. Beat him! Boss, please! Boss! Boss! Don't move! What's that? Please don't do it, guys! Hold him tight. Please, don't kill me! Arrest them all! Goddamn it! Run! You son of a bitch! Let go of me, shit! -Let go of me, dammit! - Don't move. What is it? Prosecutor? Are you Prosecutor Kim Jae-young? Who?are you? Don't you remember me? I'm Park from Prosecutor Yang's office. - Ah, Chief Park. - Yes! - Did those bastards hurt you? - It's okay, I'm fine. Are you alright, sir? - You should've come sooner. - I'm sorry, sir. - Those pricks??- Useless bastards?? You should at least tell me the charges! Don't push me! You crazy son of a bitch! How dare you terrorize a prosecutor of Korea? You call me a bastard? You know who I am? You son of a bitch! Come here, I'll kill you! Take him right now! That stupid moron?? Yes, I got them all. You deserve to rot behind bars. Pardon? I will kill you! - You stupid thugs??- Yes, sir. Fraud, forging diplomas, pyramid schemes, identity theft?? Ten criminal convictions at the age of 32. You're the most crooked crook of all. It's all I could do to survive. I still can't believe it. How dare you impersonate a prosecutor? You're not from Hwimoon High? Sorry. I can see you like fooling people. Let's see if you keep laughing back in prison. Sir. I do have something to tell you. Don't anteaters get sick of only eating ants? In times of turbulence, a hero always appears. I'll throw you in prison right now if you try to fool me again. It's the case attracting all the media attention. And the only one who can solve it is you, Prosecutor! After you crack this case, you'll be real famous. How do you like that? Mr. Shark? What is it? It's been a while, sir. I'm busy. Let's keep it short. If I could keep it short, why come see you? I don't know where to begin?? You trying to squeeze some last pennies out of me? I'm talking about helping each other. Get in. Let's talk on the way. You look quite worn out. How are things? You showed up after 5 years to ask me that? Listen, you don't have to make things complicated. I'm not coming to you with empty hands. A month after the election on Independence Day there'll be a special pardon. And another on Thanksgiving. I arranged everything for you to come out then. I'm mad dog Byun Jae-wook. You know me. I can't bear a false accusation. Got something up your sleeve? Why go overboard like this? I remember you were at least a man of sense. There is nothing a framed ex-prosecutor can't do. You still don't get it, do you? You put yourself in this mess. Please save me. I'll confess everything. Stand up. You should've acted more like a man. I can't?. ff,breathe?? 5 years ago, that night I told you to hand Lee Jin-seok over to Yang. Don't you remember? If you had listened to me none of this would have happened. Don't blame me. Give that testimony in court. I did this shit for 25 years. Don't you remember who taught you? You can't get me. Still the same, you and your bluffing. Do you still secretly put water in your soju? You act so manly, but you're a weak bastard. Alright then. See you in court. You look really terrible. Don't you want to spend the rest of your term in peace? Here. He's just someone you met in prison. You come first. Mr. Woo, a word please! You're summoned as a witness, what will you testify? The truth is that I'm not sure why I was called at this critical time. They say Byun will reveal the true offender. I know nothing about this. But if he was falsely accused, I hope he can prove himself innocent and return to society. Any comment on the campaign slush fund? Nothing further to say. How do you feel right now? Please say something! No. 3820! Depart for the court, come out! Captain! - What is it? - Warden wants to see you. - What for? - I don't know, sir. Stand against the wall. You stay right there. Young-cheol! Hey buddy. Young-cheol! Weren't you transferred? I am sorry, sir. I truly am. What is with you? What happened? Guard! Guard! Anyone there? Damn it! The court will have a recess due to a delay in the defendant's arrival. We will resume in half an hour. What? I understand. What's going on? He was stabbed. What? I get a strong sense that my life is screwed because of you mo. Why on earth did I listen to you? Goddamn it. What should we do? We? Who are we? You think I'm your mate? Sorry for keeping you. We'll wrap it up soon. It's okay. Don't worry too much, Congressman. I don't worry about you. You always think one step ahead. Why should I be worried? ls this Korean Air? I want the earliest flight ticket to Koreatown in the US! Wherever works fine. The closest one to K-Town! Why's it so expensive? Damn it! I don't think we can proceed like this. Don't you think, prosecutor? Can we wait a bit longer? The defendant's condition has not been officially reported. There's no reason to kill any more time. The court will adjourn due to the defendant's absence and will be rescheduled later. Please wait, your honor! I am sorry. Something happened on the way. I apologize, your honor. I see. You should keep to the schedule. The court is resumed. First, witness for the defense... Mr. Han Chi-won? Mr. Han. Did you work for Far East Construction 5 years ago? Yes, I did. Then you must've been close to the victim, Lee Jin-seok. Of course. We shared life's joys and sorrows. What was he like, Lee Jin-seok? A good, sensitive man. A rare thing in that field. But he suffered breathing problems and couldn't even run to catch a bus. He always carried an inhaler. - An inhaler? - Yes. By an inhaler, do you mean a nebulizer for asthmatics? Yes, that's right. Then that nebulizer must've been indispensable to him. Of course! He'd die instantly without it. As he can't breathe. Understood, thank you. Witness, did you know Jang Hyun-seok, president of Far East Construction? I sure did. He was like a big brother to me. I worked for him at the scene of the police assault case and recently on an election campaign. Which campaign office did you work for? Am I fully protected here? Witness, be assured. Thank you, your honor. The campaign office for Mr. Woo Jong-gil over there. Can you specify your role there? I delivered boxes full of cash from Mr. Jang to Mr. Woo's campaign office. Do you have evidence for what you just said? I have pictures on Facebook from the bird sanctuary protest and my days on the campaign. I submit this material as evidence. No further questions. Prosecutor, please proceed. Mr. Han Chi-won. Can you confirm that everything you just said is the truth I've never lied in my life. ls it true that Jang Hyun-seok's slush fund was used as campaign money for Woo Jong-gil? Yes, it is 1000/o accurate. Thank you. No further questions. Yes. Hey. What are you doing? Are you a prosecutor or a defense attorney? I'm trying to reveal the truth as prosecutor. You realize you're stepping into very dangerous waters? Yes, I do. But I am certain about this. Let's continue. Alright. Let's see where it leads us. Yes, your honor. Next... Witness for the prosecution, Mr. Woo Jong-gil, please come forward. I solemnly swear to tell nothing but the truth and will be punished if I do otherwise. Prosecutor, the witness is yours. Witness, how would you describe your relationship with Jang? He's one of my supporters, but not a personal relation. These documents show that Jang was charged four times from 1988 to 2006 for organized violence and circulation of illegal funds. But all of his cases were dropped by the same prosecutor. Tell me. What name is written as prosecutor? Do you feel reluctant to say it? It's my name. But how is this related to my testifying as a witness? I am saying that you're not unconnected to Lee's death. Then you should reveal the circumstances of his death at the prosecutor's office. Why keep straying from the issue? And I remind you, I'm a witness for the prosecution who should receive your protection. Identify well who's friend or foe. Do I really have to explain A to Z about the trial? Mr. Prosecutor? No further questions. Defendant, He's one of my supporters, but not a personal relation. Yes, of course. Mr. Woo, who do you think killed Lee Jin-seok? Isn't his death the reason you wear that uniform? Then why do you think I killed Lee Jin-seok? I guess you would know best. That's not for me to answer. For every homicide, there should be a motive. The one who benefits from the victim's death is usually the one we identify as a suspect. So in this homicide case, who reaped the largest benefit? As you all see, not me. The one with free access to the prosecutor's office, who can destroy evidence, manipulate the court and use false charges to get a sentence of 15 years. Shouldn't this person be the suspect? What are you talking about? I am asking you why you killed Lee Jin-seok. Listen, defendant. Do you have evidence? You mustn't falsely accuse a candidate for congress with no evidence but wordplay. Don't you think, your honor? Delete the defendant's questions from the record. Defendant, please continue. Order in the court! No further questions? Witness Park Joon-beom overturned his testimony stating that Lee Jin-seok was an asthmatic. This is the list of evidence from the crime scene. But the inhaler, indispensable for an asthmatic doesn't appear on the list. The victim had the inhaler but it disappeared after his death. If so, we should assume someone hid or destroyed it. And that someone must be the real culprit. Witness, do you know who hid it? How should I know? Let me ask again. Do you know who hid it? I said for certain I don't know. I submit this as evidence. It wasn't accepted in advance. Unless the prosecution agrees... I agree. Evidence accepted then. You should wash your car. 50 million won. It'll be wired after the election. Don't ever come see me again. Thank you, sir. By the way, you disposed of that inhaler back then? This is the victim's inhaler that disappeared from the crime scene. Chief Interrogator Kang heard in the recording kept it in secret from you for the sake of his safety. I see your time in jail has turned you into a real criminal. If you continue this farce, I'll leave the stand. Sit down, witness! Sit down, I said! Do you still deny it even with the evidence? Did you hide the inhaler, knowing Lee was asthmatic? And then frame me for all this? Judge, won't you do anything about this circus? Denial only makes you uglier. You should at least be humble before the evidence. Evidence, my ass! Woo Jong-gil, you're finished. You madman. Once you were a prosecutor, but now you entice the court with phony evidence? Phony? How would you know? How would you know if it's real or phony? The inhaler? That should be floating somewhere in the Han River. The inhaler? That should be floating somewhere in the Han River. I wanted to hear you say it yourself in front of everyone. The witness confessed to suppressing evidence. I request you arrest Woo as a suspect for murder. Shut the hell up! You think you'll escape this unharmed? What? Let go of me, bastards! Witness! Obey the court's order! You all try to frame me with this pathetic scheme! Don't you know who I am? Detain him right now! Stop it sons of bitches! You think I'll go down alone? This is all a political show! You're all being fooled! Congressman Kang! Judge! Please, Judge Choi... Defendant, do you have anything left to say? I was a violent prosecutor. I conducted forced investigations. I violated human rights and abused my influence in the name of public power. Therefore, I am guilty. But I think I paid the price for my crimes serving 5 years in prison. Please let me return to society now. Today Seoul Central Prosecution arrested and charged Woo Jong-gil, a former congressional candidate, for conspiring with Far East Construction to destroy evidence and commit murder. The prosecution also uncovered a plot by Woo and Jang to frame former prosecutor Byun Jae-wook for the crimes they committed. Are you personally close to Candidate Woo? A few calls betwen members of the same party. Can't I call the person who will inherit my precinct? - Please comment, sir! - Hey, don't take photos! Kyung-gyu! - Here! - Hey, this way! Why are you standing there like an idiot? No one came to see you? What kind of life have you led so far? Guess I'm all you've got. Have a bite. Why are you acting like a stranger? Brother, I have a killer item. Let's talk it over on the way to Seoul. Your intelligence combined with my skills, wow! Don't be difficult on a day like this. Come on, my car?ff over there. The bus station is really far. John 16:33. Let's live honestly, shall we?
