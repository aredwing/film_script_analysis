Freddie, watch it. - Oh, God! Oh, shit! - Freddie! Oh, my God! Oh! Shit! That was kind of fun. Hi. I'm looking for Wall. For Otto Wall. Okay. I... I never should've let Freddie drive so fast. That was so... so dumb of me. What are you thinking? Huh? What are you thinking? What if you lose your foot? - My foot? The doctor said that there was a chance. No. No way. No chance. Why did you have to do this now? Hey, come here. - What are we gonna do? Come here. Come here. Listen. - Otto... Come over here. Come over here. Listen, I'm telling you, we're gonna get through this. Okay. We're gonna be just fine. This is nothing. It's a nick, it's a scratch. We'll be fine. Come here. Give me a hug. You don't believe me? Mama, why did this happen to daddy? Why do these things always happen to daddy? He doesn't pay attention. Hey! What are we going to do with you? Ginny. - You saw the caller I.D. It's Ginny Summerson. Your senior counselor from Camp Mishancominga. How are you? - Goo... - And guess what? Liz, Collie and I are organizing a 20th anniversary camp reunion. Great. - Isn't that great? And Russell and Randall Kendriff will come. And Lara Cuff. Lara Cuff. Ha ha. I thought that would get you. Now listen, Otto, I'm gonna send you the e-vite and you come, okay? Bye. - Goodbye. Bye. I wanna pray for daddy. Pray? - Yes. I want God to be nice to him. Aah! I need you to come to my therapist this afternoon at 3 o'clock. Can you make it? Um... you have a therapist? So Otto. How is your foot? Are you comfortable there? Oh, yes, thanks. It's fine. Thank you. Yes. Annie thinks that you're almost healed. I'm so glad you've been... Had quite a time of it, haven't you? Oh, it's, you know... it's not such a big deal. Well, you're lucky in a way. Oh, I know. I am. Yes. It's nice to put a face to your name finally. Thanks. I... I... I... I need to... I think... I'm sorry. It's alright. Your marriage is over. Excuse me. Your marriage. It's over. No. What? And Annie would like for you to get your own place as soon as possible. What? And arrangements will be made, of course for your daughter. Uh, responsibilities that have to be shared. You both work. So Annie needs for you to be flexible... Annie, Annie, what is this? I have a lawyer. Gus Menzies. The guy from TV? - I know Gus. The "Gotta Call Gus" guy? He's very good. - Wait a minute. Wait. You have a lawyer? Now, hold on. Annie, are you serious? I mean this is... this is crazy. It's always hard to hear. Don't you think that we should discuss this? No, no, it's not open to discussion. No. I want you to leave. Why? What's happened? It's better for everybody. Why? I mean, don't you think we should try and find someone to... to talk to about this or some kind of I mean, if you're... We could get counseling. I mean if you really want to... I don't want to. - If you're serious. I don't understand. Are you that unhappy? You know we don't need to get into that right now. Now is not the time. Now is not the time? You know this session really is just to notify you of Annie's intention. Will you please... Please. Why are you unhappy? Is... is it something... What am I not doing? - Otto. What happened? How did I not know? Is it... is because of my accident? No, it's not. - No. Because I know it was stupid and it's all my fault but I'm gonna be up completely soon. I really am. And I'll be able to help out more with Ede. Otto. Otto. - And at home, I'll be... Otto, honey, this, it's... It's over. Will you stop it, please. Just... God damn it. Please tell me why you would do this? Like this? Just... just blind side me like this without any warning or anything? It just seems crazy. It's hard to take in, you know. It's trauma. Trauma is... Will you shut the fuck up. - You know, you need to... You gotta shut the fuck up. Okay? I don't wanna do this. I do. We don't even fight. - I know. Exactly. Can you... What about Ede? She'll be fine. She knows. She knows something isn't right. And she's resilient. Thank you. And she won't... - No, no. It's over. Done. Case closed. Bam. They filed electronically, so you couldn't stop even if you wanted too. A fait accompli. I don't understand. Uh... fait accompli. Uh... That... that means it's over. I mean, apparently she's been working on that for a while. Gosh, what... what happened? I mean, you didn't... You didn't try to murder her or something, did ya? We were fine. And I thought I... Maybe 3 years ago, there was some suggestion of going to counseling, but I don't even remember what be... became of that. I can't do anything? Well, you can move on. Listen, I can't... Well, again, I can't tell you how sorry I am, but we'll see things are fair and square you know, property wise. Now, uh, I need your e-sig... Oh, gee-whiz. I need your e-signature on this thing. So this is the last one that I thought of. Uh... maybe this will suit what you're looking for. Did I, uh, mention wantin' a large backyard? Annie... You could've gotten someone to help you. You could... What time does Ede get dropped? I can do it in time. It just took longer with, you know, one foot and I... Ede. - Ede. I'm fine. Leave me alone. Ede, hi. What are you doin'? Ooh. That sounds cool. Fabulous! Wife! Yeah. I didn't break it. I fell over... It's so hard to get it on. Oh, no, it's supposed to be a skirt. Yeah, like right there, that would look better. No, I don't wanna wear this. I don't wanna be the princess. I wanna be the queen, or the king. Ede? Hey... Ede, maybe I can pick you up after that and you can come see what I have done just for you. I think you're gonna like... Okay. No, I can't do Wednesday. Can you do Thursday? Tumblin'? You do tumblin'? Uh, do you have any time open on Friday? Don't do it. Don't do it. Don't do it. This is... Oh, divorced. Oh, my God, and Stephanie Giljames you are still so hot! Oh, Lara. Look at this. Look. Did you see? And then look. And look at this. Look at this thing! Do you think it's pretty? I love it. Come over here. Oh, my gosh! Wife! Ede? Garlic toast. Yeah? And then we started running on the jungle gym and then we started going on the top and going down. Then we were pretending that one of the other clans was discovering us. We had to run and hide. 'Cause it'll be dangerous if one of the other clans discovered another clan. 'Cause they'd kill 'em. Mm-hmm. And then, Lilly's mom gave us fresh roadkill, which was muffins. What's fresh... of what? - Fresh roadkill. She gave us what she said was fresh roadkill. Even though it was pumpkin muffins. Oh, she was joking? - Yeah. Okay. You're boiling over. Watch out! So anyway, Lilly has a big house, so last Saturday I went over and she has a garden with these cool, old stonewalls and we played like it was a castle. Like it was a castle? Have you seen my backyard? Have you seen how big it is? Come on. Come on. I'll show you the backyard. Come on. Can we have a garden? I wanna make, like, a secret garden with walls and gates and flowers. Uh... walls? Okay. Like over here. You can do that, couldn't you? And then maybe Lilly could come over. Um... sure. Yeah. Let's ask her for a date. Or um... you know, play date. Yeah. Except, you know, her mother doesn't know you. You'd have to make that okay. Absolutely. How do we do that? Goodnight, Edith. Ow! You shocked me. Sorry. Daddy, you're so funny. I love you. I love you too. And, um, I'm really sorry this all had to happen. I know. Mama says now she can breathe. Can you breathe? Are you okay? I'm okay. That's not work, is it? Oh, it's, um... Mm-hmm. Come on. I heard some news. I wanna talk to you. Follow me. Is it the audit? Are you... You're not firing people, are you? Don't tell me that I'm gonna lose my job. You're getting divorced? How... how did you hear that? I haven't even told anyone. Oh, that's horrible! Horrible! Oh, I bet you're just stunned, right? I mean... listen, we don't have to talk about it. I mean, I am your boss, it's private. Yeah. Well, I... Well, you just think of yourself as the biggest loser ever, right? Well... I really don't know what's happening. I just sort of... I just sort of muddle through my days, you know. And I'm... I'm stunned like you said. Yeah, well, I don't wanna scare you too badly but divorce is hands down the worst thing I ever went through my entire life. Really? - Mm-hmm. 'Cause no matter how horrible the marriage was... I don't even think it was that bad. Yeah, well, you know what? It's not as bad as what's ahead of you because at one time you thought there was love there, right in your life? Well, you were wrong. Listen to me, okay? It's been 5 years, and I still don't have a clue why it all went wrong, really. I mean, you're never going to really understand. How did you get through it? Oh, Otto, I was suicidal for like a year. And I didn't even know it. I was just drifting along, right? Took me forever to find a reason to live. And what was it? - I'm just so sorry for you. I can't tell you how sorry I am. Tell me you'll be okay. - I'll be okay. Yeah? You're gonna be alright? Sure. - Oh, God! It's awful. Thanks for your concern, Holly. I've got 8 cats. Okay. I shouldn't have brought it up. Shazam! Dick Conner! Annie! Annie! Fuck! Fuck! Shit! Shit! You know, if this hematoma doesn't go down we might have to go back in and change the bolts. Okay? Uh, go back in? - Uh-huh. And let me tell you this. You start feeling a knobby hard place up here? And you find your toes are turning purple? We will be chopping it off. The foot. Um, uh... No? - Oh, yeah. You know, I've set a goal of... You know, there's this 10K that I'd like to be ready for. You know, I'm trying to scare you. Oh, you're doing a good job. So be smart. How are you doing otherwise? - I'm great. Mm-hmm. How are your girls? Annie's running? We're separated. Well, no wonder you're pushing. Yeah. I'm just trying to get healthy. I got... I got what you need. Generic Ativan. Just for when the blues come on. Mellows things out. I pop 'em like candy. I'm kiddin'. But we all need some way to get through the night. Try and find some other activity that keeps you off your feet. Okay. - Know what I mean? Huh? - Alright. Keep using the cane. "...free time. What's your favorite restaurant?" Oh! Oh, my God. Otto! Aah. - I gotta go. Have the Hammersmark transferred to Chicago and don't bother me with it again. Oh, my God! You look fantastic. Thank you. Wow! - Ha ha! I'm always early. - Good. Oh! You're so hot! You're handsome! You're... you're smokin'! Do you not hear that all the time? No. I'm married. Or... - Okay. Um, sit down. I got this Pinot Gris. Okay. - wife. And you're like still so beautiful. You still talk so softly. I was so thrilled to find you again. I mean, how long has it been since we dated? Like, 15 years? Uh, more actually. Ow! - Jesus! Whoa! It's alright. Are you okay? - Yeah. Life, huh? - Just not myself. Um, uh, yeah! I saw on the, um... I saw on the, um... You've got big sons. I just... - Can you believe it? I mean, they're both at McCallie Prep. Mm-hmm. And, um, you've a little girl. I do. Uh, uh, Ede. She's 9. Hmm. - She's great. Who did you marry, Otto Wall? Annie. Mick Williams. I don't think you know her. Um, and... and we're not together. Hmm. Is she beautiful? Uh, um... Yeah. Yeah. My sons are gonna be studs. - No kidding. Come on. Grayson was a stud. - Yeah. You never met Grayson, did you? No, I don't think so. Not face to face. - He was a fucking asshole! He cheated on me four times. I mean, how stupid am I? What about you? - Um... Um, no. You know, no I... No cheating. Are you recent? We divorced last fall. Well, we're... we're... We're not actually divorced yet. Hmm. Wow! I've never said that word before. Get used to it. It's a fucking great word. It's a great place to be. No fucking strings! I have never had so much fun. I should tell you straight out I'm not around a lot. In and out. No strings. Thank you for driving up from Charlotte. No problem. I think this wine's too fruity. Um... Let me order something else? Do you want something, or... What do you want? Now get up. I like to be at my desk by 8. If I go 90 on the freeway, I'll make it. I have a power bar in the car. It was so fun to see you, Otto. You should think about boarding school for your kid. Stay in touch when you can, alright? It's so easy now. Don't get up, okay? You are shitting me. We had a really hot time. This is an old girlfriend who found you on Facebook? Women. You know, it's... it's kind of exciting. It's like a new world. I mean, I don't know if it'll even ever happen again but I think it was just maybe 'cause... I'm available? - This isn't dating. Ladies have needs. Daddy? - Yeah. I wanna go to church. What? What? Otto? You there? Otto. Otto! Oh. Shit. Um... what was that the other night? Uh, last week. That cursing, that message you left? What was that? I had... I had just... And I've just been so pleased with how civil this has all been. So maybe just don't... do it again, okay? Shit. You know what, maybe we can work something out? Uh, so we aren't both here at the same time too? 'Cause you know, this is... this is my time. This is your time? Ede has tae kwon do. I have 50 minutes. You know that, Otto. I know this is hard for you and I'm sorry about that. Do you think Ede's fine with this? It's all for the good. All for the good? Listen. It's nobody's fault. It's both of our fault. That's the way life is. No. Not always. Annie, you and I... Hey. You and I, we have got to just... Really? Doing this here? That's really fair. Fair? I... I'm only gonna get, like, 20 minutes to swim now. Well, I can pick Ede up after tae kwon do and then I can... I can bring her over to you later. No, because we have an arrangement. Annie, I wanna... If you wanna communicate with me do it through your lawyer. That's what we're supposed to do. Wait. Just wait. Let's just get on with things. Okay? Because... I am. I have. Goodbye, Otto. - Just... God damn it! Okay, um... Let me think. I liked the picture of you in your kayak. Um... I liked your name. Oh, God! Mildred? Yeah. Are you kidding me? It's old fashioned and cool. Good. Then what about me? Well, I like your face. And your, really, your beautiful breasts. And your booty. You like my sweet little cooty cat? I... 'Cause I like your cock in my pussy. That's what I think is sexy. I like your hands on my flesh. I like that you have calluses on the palms of your hands. So that it's rough when you touch the inside of my thighs. What's your last name? Wall. What? Wall. Wall. That's kind of funny. It's Anglo-Saxon. Oh, yeah. Of course. Um... Uh... Mildred... are you... wet? Do me right, Mr. Wall. And then pull out really slowly until I scream. Can you do that? Can you do that for me? Well, I can give it a shot? Um... can I kiss your little... cooty cat? And... Yeah. Blow softly on it? And maybe just, like, flick it? And... and have my rough... have my calluses... Yeah, your calluses. On your nipples? Yeah. Lightly. Mildred, I... I wanna turn you over... wife. - Mm-hmm. And I wanna kiss you... and your breasts... and then that place where you're neck and your shoulder meet... um... Clavicle? Yes. Clavicle. Yeah. Kiss my clavicle. Oh, God. Oh, it's so good. Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh. Fuck. That was good. That was amazing. Thank you. Oh, the pleasure was mine. It... Believe me I don't like to have to call you either but you don't answer my emails. All I do is chauffeur her around. You know we need time to do things together. And... and... and I know she wants to because she texted me. I can take her this weekend. Well, can't she... can't she spend the night at Molly's another time? Huh? Can we make this work? I can pick her up at 3. You wanna try it again? - Yeah. Come here. Let me see that. You moved your snot to your cheek. You can't... Comes out of your nose, you gotta flick it off out of... out of the pool. That's what the pros do. Daddy, you lost your screw-in tooth. It was permanent I thought. Oh, my gosh! Um... come on, let's see if we can find it. Thank you very much. What did he say? He said I've got an appointment for next Wednesday. And that these things happen. Yeah. They do. Hello. - Hey, there. Hi, I'm Ede. - Hello, Ede. Have y'all been to our church before? No, but my daddy needs it. Well... we are all glad that you're here today. Miss Ede. - Miz Ede. Thanks. We hope y'all keep comin'. We all need to find what sustains us. Thank you. Such a nice guy and then bam he hurts himself... Good singing though. Did you like the singing? Mm-hmm. What the... What is it? What happened? I think we've been robbed. Oh, shit. They took my old CD player. Who did? - No, no, no. Hey, hey, hey. Don't step on the glass. Just stand back, Ede. Don't touch anything, honey. Just hold on. We're gonna call the police right now, okay? Shh. Just stand still. It's okay. You can go. I'm fine. Sorry. Why do you look so familiar? Daddy, have you double checked all the doors and windows like I asked? You are a nurse. I'm the night supervisor at Heritage Village retirement community. I hear that's nice. - It is. Where's your daughter this weekend? Is she with your soon-to-be ex-wife? Yeah. Yeah. She's really, really cute. Yes. - What does she like to do? She's actually really excited right now because I'm building a stonewall around this garden that she's planned. Although I don't know if I'll ever finish it, but... This is really great. - Do you think so? Yeah, I do. That sounds like completely cool and I'm excited. I'm glad you could come. Oh. I love it. It's so cute. Oh, my God. Ah. It's great, so great. What is this? Can we go for a ride? Um... let's just hike. Are there trails? - We'll bushwhack. Okay. I like how adventurous you are. Ayi! I'm Debbie Spangler! No echo. Oh, I feel like I'm getting good at this. What? - Uh, do you like fish tacos? I never had them. Really? - Yeah. Well, do you like fish? I do like fish. I think you're gonna like this sauce. And I really don't wanna burn this fish. Oh. Let me just, uh, turn it off... wife. Adventurous? Oh, my goodness. Wow. Yes. Fuck! Fuck! Again. Yeah. I'm Debbie Spangler! I'm Debbie Spangler! I wanna read my Bible. You shouldn't have done that. What's that? We shouldn't have. Done what? Last night? I don't like myself right now and I really wish that I hadn't come. Oh. Uh... That's too bad, you know, because I really enjoyed myself. Well, I feel terrible. I feel so terrible. I feel so bad, and it's all your fault. You are a terrible person for doing this to me! Wha... Hold on a second. You know, I... I'm sorry if you feel like you did something that you didn't wanna do but I would never have forced you to do anything. And really, we didn't do anything wrong you know. It's okay. - Yes, we did. No. - Yes, we did. What are you... - Yes, we did, Otto! No. - You're someone's father. Oh, my God, this is the worst thing in the world. No. Debbie, no, it's not. - I don't even know you. We don't even know each other. Who are you? Who are you? I'm Otto Wall. - You are a crazy person. I'm not crazy. - Yes, you are. You're a crazy person. How did I even end up going with you at all? What did you say to me? What did you do? You wrote to me and... - Well, I was out of my mind! Debbie... - I wasn't thinking. Stop it! Why was it me? Why was it Debbie Spangler? Wait, your... wait, your bag, your bag, your bag. Ede. And what is this? Tha-a-a... Oh, my goodness! Okay, can I have that, please? That is a toy. And it's for adults. How do you use it? It... It's... It's for adults. How's school, Ede? Man, don't laugh. It was terrible! You know, when she was holding it in her little hand. It's funny though. You can't see that? Am I screwing her up? Oh, that Debbie sounds like a maniac. No, she's a nice person. Kinda unstable but you know. Jeez, you know, what could I do? I... I can't handle that. These women... You don't, you don't promise them anything, do you? I like them. I... I want them to be happy. No, sex. That's what you all want. It was not like this when I was single. And after 11 years of Annie not... You know, the last two years, we never... There wasn't any love. So... And maybe I should take some responsibility there too. You know, she was always secretive and... and... distant. You know, I... I guess, I... I guess I just gave up trying to reach her. I did not know what was going on with her. And I don't... I don't... I don't... I don't know if I ever did. God, that is so sad. But now, you know, just... Just to make someone else feel good, it's... it's you know, it's given m... me my confidence back. You know, as a man. Freddie, are you still there? Uh, yeah. You sound like a girl. I don't know what you're talking about. Listen, go for a run. It'll all feel better. I gotta save some kids' lives here, buddy. You're okay. Bye-bye. Oh, God! Maybe we sh... Listen, listen, listen. - What? This is so important. This is so important. What? - We've to be quiet, okay? Okay. - My daughter's sleeping. Okay. We'll be kinda quiet. Are you okay? No, I think I swallowed my tooth. You did what? - I think I swallowed my tooth. Your tooth? - Mm-hmm. I did. I swallowed my fake tooth. Shh. Shh. Shh. You swallowed your tooth! - Hmm. It's not funny. It's not. - It is funny. - No, it's not. - Maybe we should get upstairs. Oh, it's fine. - Aah. Okay. Hey, do you maybe wanna go on a date? What? Well, I was thinking, Mildred maybe we could go to a movie. I'm sorry, um, but are you, like, wanting more? 'Cause I don't... I don't think that that's what I want. Yeah, I mean, and this... this thing that we have that's awesome for me, you know? Hmm. Is that okay with you? I mean, what do you... what do you think that you want? I... Okay. Alright, goodnight, Otto. Goodnight, Mildred. I'm in. You know, you are kind of a disaster. Really? - Yeah. But you're a crazy fun fuck. Hurrah! And you make me feel pretty. - Daddy! Oh, hey, what is it? What is it? What is it? You can't leave me. I'm not gonna leave you. Shh. Hey, hey, shh. Listen, listen, listen, I'm right here. Okay? I love you more than anything in the world. Come here. Come here. Oh. Otto! Otto! Otto Wall is here. Otto. Hey. Hey, Otto. You remember me? You don't, do you? Liz! Liz! Liz, Otto came. Liz's mother's here. Remember her? There she is!

I knew you'd be late. Oh-ho. Yes, this looks awesome. You did a great job... - Well, thank you. Well, you know, it wouldn't be the same without you. I'm so glad you came. And then he starts just swimming around with this pitiful... This is Rosie. - How are you? Good.

Oh, uh-huh. Hey, did you and your husband, did you fight? God, yeah. Um... yes. Mark, my... my first husband... he tried to, uh, kill me more than once. And I have a restraining order against him. I mean, I still... I still do. God, Lara, how did you... Survive? Yeah. Well, uh, well, what... what can I tell you? Uh, I don't know what... what Ginny said. Um... Mark and I had a son that drowned, Otto. I'm so sorry. Yeah. Thanks. You know, I... I have no idea how I, you know, how I did it, and I have no answers. You just, you, you know, you take all this stuff, all this life stuff and... and... and you can, you know, collapse or you can not. And I... I chose... I chose not to. But I'll, I'll tell you, Otto. I... I think ab... I think about him all the time. And that's... that's... you know, I guess I... I do it for him. I just continue... for Paul. That was his name. You, you know, you make a choice and you live your life, and that's it. So deep. Anyway, I'm looking to have an adventure... you know, of my own design. I'm thinking of, like, starting a blog. Shall I put you on my list? Would you... Uh... yes. Sure. Please do. God, Otto. It's so weird! What is? - You and me. I feel like, I feel like I...we just spoke... Yesterday. I know. And it's been, like... like 20 years. Isn't that crazy? Yeah. - That's a lifetime. It's a riot. Oh, good. I'm so glad to get you. Listen, Lara, I was, uh... Is there any way I can come see you some time? Just drive over and... This is Otto. Yeah, no, no, no. No, nothing's wrong. I just, uh, I would I would really like to talk to you some time or... When? You're in town now? Today? I mean, well, if you get the chance before you go back you know, that would... that would be great. No, no, I know. Just... just see if it works out. It's no big deal. Okay. Bye. Oh, shit. I'm back here. Hi. You have something I want. I also, I really want to apologize, Otto. I thought about things and... I was just freaking out or something in the mountains. I run a little hot and cold. Yeah, just a little. Um... you know, it's... It was no big deal. We didn't know each other very well and, you know, maybe we shouldn't have... No, I do that sometimes when I'm overwhelmed. Really? - Yeah. But I prayed about it... and, um... I really enjoyed myself... in the mountains with you. Good. I... I did too for the most part. And I think that we should... get to know each other. 'Cause I think that you are a really good father. Do you really think so? Mm-hmm. - Oh. Um... - Do, um... you forgive me? Sure. Sure I do. Oh, goodness. I don't know if, um... Are you sure this is a good... idea Debbie... Spangler? Yes. Oh, my God. I think that's Ede. - No, no, no. Come on. No. Don't, don't, don't. Aren't you early? Where's Ede? She's... We need to talk. There's been a change of plans. What? Oh, so, you get to change plans just like that? God. - She cried, Otto. She really doesn't want to come over here. What are you talking about? Well, when I finally got her to speak... she said... that you have girls here all the time. Uh, I... I've never had women here when Ede's been here. Really? She's says she hears you fucking. What? She says that you have sex toys. I... Is she lying to me? She's lying to me. Listen, there was a, um... There was a woman, a friend... - Mm-hmm. A woman who had been in the car... not with Ede. She dropped her sex toy in your car. Annie... - No! I'm not exposing my daughter to that. Come on. She wasn't exposed to anything. And I... I'm sorry to have to tell you... that I'm going to talk to my lawyer about the joint custody. I am. I...I never thought that you were this kind of man. I didn't. I guess, I just... never really knew you very well, ever. Annie... I thought that you cared about the welfare of your child. I do! Children come first, Otto. Parents have to set an example. Oh, really? - Yes. You mean like having an affair? You mean, like fucking somebody when you're still married. Like... like never touching your husband? Is that the kind of example you thought was healthy for Ede? Otto. I... - Yeah? I know about it. I... I know what you did. I saw it on the... I know about it. What about that? And he looks like a real upstanding citizen too, is he? Is he? And does Ede not know what her mother's doing in the bedroom next to hers? In my bed! Don't you yell at me. You've never spoken to me like this. I know! It's about time. You don't have any room to judge me. My life... is my own. Richard is a wonderful man... and father. You don't fucking know him... okay? When we started texting, I... Oh, my God. And what... what I did... What, yeah? - What I did... Justify it. - I did it. I needed it. - Okay. To survive! - Okay. You're an asshole! Fuck it! - Excuse me. I'm so sorry. I just... I have to get to the nursing home to bathe Mr. Peterson by 6:00. I'm Debbie Spangler. And she's crazy. You are a very sweet man. Bless you. I try to teach Ede... that a woman has the right to be loved... and to be known. Yoo-hoo. Anybody home? Oh. I was kinda worried about you from your call. You okay, old friend? Can I go to Costa Rica with you and learn how to surf and Spanish? Sure. Do you wanna come with me to Raleigh and have dinner with my kids? If I had left 15 minutes ago, I'd still be late. I see you have some half-finished projects. Oh, yeah. - That's familiar. Yeah. Where'd you get these? Uh, they're river stones from the mountains. I love 'em. So... hard day? I mean, do you wanna... do you wanna tell me about it? Um... I... I don't know what I'm doing. I haven't, um... I mean, I really, uh... I should've been a better parent. Yeah, I mean, everybody feels that way. It's... it's normal. Yeah, I want you to meet Ede. Oh, is she... is she here? No, she won't come here. Well, do you have a picture? Yes. Oh, wow. Wow, she's wonderful. I can see you. I don't want to lose her. I'd show you, um... I'd show you my two if I could, you know, figure out... how this thing works. Oh, um, they're yelling at me... 'cause I'm not on the road. Okay. Are you coming with me? Can I stay? The night? Of course. Can we play around? For a few days? Nope. - Why not? I'm on a plane at 6:45 tomorrow morning. You're leaving tomorrow? Didn't I tell you that? I'm gonna miss you too, Otto... now that we've reconnected. Sorry. Why don't you come with me? What? - Seriously. Why not? A week or so. That's not hard. Drop everything. Um... Yeah. Could I? - Yes. Yes. You can. You can. Otto... Follow me. Ede. Oh, Ede, I'm so glad you picked up. No. No. No. That's okay. Your mom told me that you had other plans. Hey, what are you doing? Oh, that sounds like fun. Me? Well, I'm building the walls of your castle. Yes. Yes, I am. Would you, um... Maybe you'd wanna come over? I need to know exactly how you want it. Yeah. Sure. Sure there can be. We can do that. Yes. Yes. A moat?
