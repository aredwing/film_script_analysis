His number is 26... The others are useless. His number is 26... The others are useless. Not a chance. This time you won't get bail. Are you serious? Sir, please take a good look. One look is all l need. Who is your lawyer? Girdhar Sharma. - Girdhar? - Yes. - Forget the bail. - Why? He has a forgetting sickness. He doesn't even remember who his client is. He forgets his own client! Let's say... you're hoping for bail and... - Yes. Girdhar petitions the judge for a death sentence. Don't say that! There has to be some option. There is. Hire a new lawyer. lf you wish l'll represent you. And l'll also waive my fees for reading your palm. Tell me. Mr. Sharma, have some sweets. Go on... take it. - Today is ma'am's birthday. - Thank you. Go on... - Thank you. - Jolly, give us too. l'll be right there. Take your seats... Ma'am is here. Take your seats. You may proceed with the case. Your ladyship, the case can wait a bit... Today is a special day. Today is your birthday. Happy birthday, ma'am. That's all well and good... lt is my birthday but it is also work as usual, right? - Yes. - Proceed. Your ladyship... who in our district doesn't know Dr. Harphool? Only at his clinic can people expect decent treatment. There really is no case. The police and media have sensationalized it. Sensationalized it? A 14 year old boy operated on a pregnant woman. And you're saying there is no case? What l really mean is... this whole thing is fabricated. l agree the boy was present in the operation theatre but... the doctor performed the operation himself. Ma'am, he's just a child. He's innocent. He's a child. He insisted that he wanted to watch the operation being performed. So Ma'am, to keep his child happy, the doctor let him in. But... the boy didn't touch the patient. What do you want? We want bail. Ma'am, we don't have too many doctors in our district. lf you imprison the doctor, we're all doomed. Mr. Gupta, should l grant bail? No, absolutely not. The fact is the doctor wanted his son to be featured... in the Guinness book of world records. And so he let his 14 year old son perform the operation. These photographs were taken using the doctor's cell phone. Look at this. What is this? These pictures were taken on his cell phone. Then he not only threatened the lady... but also used his influence to stop her... from lodging a police complaint for a month. He misused his power and position. That's why l filed a PlL. Think about it, ma'am... what if something had gone wrong? What if? - Nothing went wrong. - What are you doing? Ma'am, l have performed more than 150 C-section operations and... and all of them went without a hitch. That doesn't mean you will get your 14 year old son to operate. l got him to operate, so what? No... Ma'am, no other 14 year old boy.. in the world has ever achieved this feat. He's getting calls from America and London... while his own countrymen want to put him down. No wonder, lndian doctors migrate overseas. Nobody appreciates talent in lndia. You accept that your son performed the operation? Ma'am? No... No, ma'am. That's not true. He's a doctor, he's not used to life in prison. He's stressed because he was imprisoned. He said that out of anger. You should brief your client well. Doctor this is a court. No one apart from l can get angry in here. l'm rescheduling the hearing. Tell me when... Ma'am, l'd appreciate if you would grant him bail. lt's your birthday today. Start the day on a kind note and you'll be blessed. Yeah, yeah... but I won't grant bail today. Let the police carry out the investigation. Please, ma'am. The judge will repent. When will you get bail and return home? Dad, don't worry. l will manage the clinic. l also performed a tonsil operation. How did it go? lt was successful. l'm proud of you. One day you will win the Nobel prize. You look so pale. You've lost weight. Doctor... sir... What is it? Don't worry. At the next hearing you will get bail. Trust me. Hello. You said that at the previous hearing too. Well, I am trying. l don't control the outcome, do l? Next time you will get bail. l'd appreciate if you'd pay my fees. Fees? The worst mistake l did was to appoint you as my counsel. Today the local court refused Dr. Harphool's bail application. We have with us advocate Mahesh Gupta who had filed the PIL. Mr. Gupta, why don't you explain the court's ruling to us... Well, Dr. Harphool wanted to achieve a Guinness record. Gupta has hit the big time. He would sit outside the court counting the hours. Tell me... One PlL and he's become a star. Dr. Harphool's lawyer was trying to get bail by offering sweets. Listen... recession has hit town. Typewriters are being stolen. Lock your chamber without fail. Okay. See you later. Don't you think you are over-reacting? Everybody has to struggle. You are not the only one. You know what my dad says... He says, the lawyer that persists will eventually succeed. Easy for your dad to say that. He represents the government. Even if there are no lawsuits, the government pays a salary. Work if there's a lawsuit or enjoy the free time. Great! Why do you think you will succeed in Delhi? Why not? lt's the capital of lndia. All the best lawyers practice in Delhi. The Supreme Court is in Delhi. My brother-in-law is there. Mark my words, l will make it big in Delhi. lf you are that confident, go ahead. Sandhya... where are you going? Hey Sandhya... listen. Sandhu... lf l leave, will you cry? You're going to Delhi, not America. lt's two hours away from here. l know but... you will get emotional, right? Sandhu... tell me... Listen, stop calling me Sandhu. lt's sounds like someone from the men's hockey team. Sandhu! Can't even call out my name. And your temper is back! You're saying that because you're angry. l know, you will miss me. After all, l am your boyfriend. As if you are the only one! lf l wish it, l can get a line of suitors. Yeah, right. This is Meerut. The guys over here know just one thing. Hang around, sleep around and vanish. You won't find someone like me. You haven't even let me kiss you yet. And l won't. l'm not your personal property. You've become quite needy these days. l think we were better off as strangers. "As l walk down your lane." "l see you drying up clothes on your terrace." "You get me gazing at you for real." "But Oh! How you fake shying away right on my face." "As l walk down your lane." "l see you drying up clothes on your terrace." "You get me gazing at you for real." "But Oh! How you fake shying away right on my face." "Well then, we're better off as strangers, I guess!" "As l leave for home after college." "You follow me riding your godforsaken scooter." "l just smile at you for no good reason." "You balloon up to cloud nine." "Let's remain strangers, its for the better." "You're right, Let's remain strangers, its for the better." "Let's remain strangers, its for the better." "Strangers." "God, l so wish your father gets hit by a speeding truck." "Gets all plastered from top to toe, with every bone broken." "God, l so wish your father gets hit by a speeding truck." "Gets all plastered from top to toe, with every bone broken." "l visit your house pretending to wish him wellness." "And we behave as strangers just the same." "Strangers." Do you want to file an affidavit? Sir, can I help you for bail? l won't charge a lot - No. - Give me one chance. Can l represent you? Do you want bail? What a jinx! We're here to get married. Jolly... come here. What's up, sir? l need a favor. Don't refuse, you will get 1000 rupees. This is new. Cops are paying lawyers. Last week we captured some terrorists. We arrested four... but the chief told the media there were five. They have to be presented in court and the media is waiting outside. What has that got to do with me? l need one more man, to present before the media. Your face will be covered. And your photo taken. That's it. Have you lost it? l'll get in trouble. You don't have to go to the court. Don't refuse... please or I'll lose my job. The chief is outside. lf l didn't have to pay rent, l'd have refused. Now that's more like it. Come on... Take him in. Jai Hind, sir. Get dressed soon. Who are you? Lashkar-e-Toiba. l'm Laugh-e-Toiba! These five terrorists were presented before a special court today. Their faces might be concealed but... they cannot hide their evil designs and ulterior motives. With cameraman, Ashok Singhal... this is Vinay Katiyal, Tez Khabre. - Good morning, Mr. Kaul. - Good morning. - How are you, Jolly? - l'm fine. l'd like a cup of tea. Right away. Listen, tea for Jolly. What's going on? Jolly, how do you spell affidavit? Affidavit? Dosen't it start with an 'E'? Do you know? - Write... - Yes. S-E-X. A-F-F-l-D-A-V-l-T. - Wow. - Thank you, Vasu. This is Vasu. He earned his LLB in Rohtak. Didn't you find anything better to do than to study law? lt's a noble profession. Fighting for the truth. Helping those in need. l don't think there's anything better than this. - Tea? - Yes. Mr. Kaul, one more cup of tea, please. Hello, brother-in-law. So, what's going on? Swatting flies and wasting time... Same thing that l did in Meerut. Stop worrying. Remember, every lawyer has his day. You should persevere until then. And someday you will also become a star lawyer. Remember these words. Alright, see you later in court. - Okay? Bye. - Bye. Star lawyer! Last year 7516 accidents took place in Delhi. But how many of those can the people here recall? But if you believe the media reports of the last six months... it seems that only one accident took place in India. The so called Land cruiser hit-and-run case... which involves one of the most respected... and law abiding families of the city. All accusations levied by the prosecution were proven false. First of all... Rahul Dewan's name only appeared in the FlR... two days after it was first filed, why? lt's never been proven that Rahul Dewan was present at the accident site. Never! Also there's no eye witness. And, before l forget... where is the imaginary Land Cruiser... in this great Land Cruiser hit-and-run case? ln fact, according to Sub- lnspector Rathi's report... the accident was caused by a truck, not a car. The investigation report is with you. Fine! l have the report. ln the past six months... the prosecution and media have created a frenzy... but there is not one single proof or evidence, nothing. This lawsuit has no merit. The only case here is the victimization of my innocent client... Rahul Diwan. Your honor... the prosecution doesn't think Rahul Dewan is innocent. l don't care what the prosecution thinks. l demand evidence. Do you have any? Where is the Land Cruiser? Where is eye witness? There's only one perception here that's being exploited. Since he is rich, he must be guilty. The media trials held outside the court don't need any evidence. Let me remind you, Mr. Prosecutor, that this is not a media trial. This is a real trial. Only one person can pass a judgment in this lawsuit. And that's our honorable judge. You still haven't lost touch of your passionate speeches, Mr. Rajpal. l'm impressed. Thank you. Prosecution... any further submissions? Your honor, if you could grant us some time... l'd like to reinvestigate a few points. More time? 35 million lawsuits are pending in Indian courts. Let's come to a swift decision on at least one. Alright, you may sit. ln the light of evidence presented during the trial... this court holds Rahul Dewan not guilty. - Yes. - Strange. The court is adjourned. Congratulations, Mr. Rajpal. Amazing... l want to wish him. Sir... l am a big fan of yours. My name is Jolly and l'm also a lawyer. Sir, I didn't learn as much in my three year law course.. as l learnt in the past five minutes. l'm from Meerut and l want to be just like you. - Brilliant! - May l go? Yes... Good luck, sir. l have no words to thank you, Mr. Rajpal. After all Rahul is the future of our family. lndeed. And such mistakes happen when you're young. But that doesn't mean you spend your life in the court or in prison. l completely agree with you, Mr. Dewan. Everybody makes mistakes. And frankly, the government hasn't made the footpath to sleep on. - Yogi... - Yes, dad. Mr. Rajpal, your full and final payment. Thank you very much. Dad insisted that l give this to you today itself. What's wrong? Any problem? We had decided on another figure. True, but you won the case in six months. Exactly my point. Your boy is back home in six months. - Come on... - Yogi, make it 30. Okay. Here you go. Happy? When you asked me to represent you, you were ready to spend millions. And l have to keep a lot of people happy, Mr. Dewan. Well with this you can keep a lot of people happy. So please keep it and don't be greedy. Mr. Dewan... thank you so much. l'll take your leave and take care of your health. Bye. ls it true? You have filed a PlL? Have you lost it? Why are you ruining your career? - Please sit... - sit... We'll talk, but sit. Relax. When you wanted to file an affidavit, you called me a dozen times. But you didn't even ask me once before you took this decision! Would you have permitted me, if l had asked? l'm not crazy. l won't advise you to ruin your life. Can't you see? Open your eyes... read the newspapers. This case has been scrutinized all over the media. Didn't you tell me, that one day l will get my due? Well, now is the time. l don't want to miss this opportunity and be a loser like them. Now l get it. You think this PlL will make you a great advocate. You think the media will throng around you and you will hit the big time. Right? lt's not that easy. lf it were, these advocates wouldn't be here like losers. They are probably still contemplating. Or probably asking someone wise like you for advice. But l filed the PIL. lt's simple. The question is, who makes the first move? Your honor, a music director toils day and night like a goldsmith. And after creating a song with all the effort and hard work... if someone steals it, it's a heinous crime against a musician. Your honor, even I'm saying the same thing. Music director Sangeet Lahiri has stolen the tune... from my client Sargam Kumar. And for that he must be punished. This is the six month old scratch recording of the tune. Once you listen, you will know which is original. Even l have a CD. Listen and decide which one is original. Hold your horses. What's going on here? l have 29 cases in my court for today. Rape, murder, corruption. And you want me to listen to your music performance? What is your name? Sargam Kumar, sir. Sing. Sir? Sing your song. Sing. "l'm ruined." That's enough. Very good, sit down. What is your name? Sir, Sangeet Lahiri. Sing. Yes. What are you doing? You will lose the case. You can't do it! Your honor, I remember the composition of the song and... l request permission to sing it. "l'm ruined." That's enough! l must say, you are a very good singer. Thank you, your honor. Actually, it's a hobby since childhood. l also have a small local band. Birthdays, anniversaries... we perform anywhere. - But I don't understand one thing. - What? You have the file regarding the case. Then why did you ask me to get these files? lf you could figure that, you would be in my shoes. Yes. Listen, a lawyer should have many files on his desk. lt gives the impression to the opposition... and the judge that he has done his homework. lmpression! l hope you have done your homework. l've heard that Judge Tripathi is very strict. Okay, let's see. So... Mr. Tyagi... Yes, sir. Why did you file this PIL? The police had completed its investigation. l'm sure even the judgment was well thought. Why do you want a reinvestigation? Your honor, I'm sure you read last Friday's Times of India. The report clearly states that the police tampered with some facts... and critical evidence was withheld from the court. Eye witness interviews have appeared all over the media. But not one of them was called in to testify. Sir, NDTV had a one hour special coverage about this case. And the Star TV series 'We The People' had... Hold on, just a minute... What did you say your name was? Jagdish Tyagi, sir. But everyone calls me Jolly. Where did you get your law degree? Meerut Law College. Weren't you taught that... the court doesn't accept media reports as admissible evidence? Then why are you giving me that lecture? You filed this PlL? You've typed 'Apple' instead of 'appeal'! And 'prostitution' instead of 'prosecution' There are five mistakes in every line. Filing a PlL is a prank? Do you have any substantial evidence? Sir, I need some more time to put it together. You should've already done that. Why are you wasting our time? Sorry sir. l'm rescheduling the hearing. You better have the evidence in place by then. Otherwise you'll find this PlL in the garbage bin! So, Jolly, not going home? ln some time. Excuse me, sir? Are you Jagdish Tyagi... Jolly? Yes. You have filed a PlL in the Rahul Dewan case? Yes, do you have a problem with that? No. l'm glad you did. My name is Albert Pinto. l hail from Goa. l have a small business... and l often come to Delhi in this regard. l was in Delhi on April 20th... the day of the accident. As l was returning home after watching a late night film... l saw the accident take place. l am the only real eye witness in this case. Why didn't you come forward until now? Why didn't you do anything? Sir, that night l did everything a concerned citizen would do. l rushed to the police station... and told them l saw the accident take place. - l also lodged a complaint. - Do you have a copy of it? You are aware that a lot of wealthy people are involved in this case. l was told that l would be called if necessary. l kept waiting. No one asked me anything, no one called. Nothing. When l heard that you have filed a PlL, l mustered some courage. l mean... there is someone who has the guts to stand up for the truth. And here I am. Will you testify in court? Of course l will. And why not? l'm willing to go the distance for the truth. Trust me, l am with you. Advocate Jagdish Tyagi... ..who had filed a PIL in the Land Cruiser hit-and-run case... has created a sensation by submitting an affidavit in court. This affidavit states that Mr. Albert Pinto is the.. only eye-witness of this gruesome accident. The court has accepted the affidavit and... ordered Rahul Dewan's counsel Tejinder Rajpal... to be present at the next hearing. Mr. Rajpal... l've heard you... only accept lawsuits presented in the Supreme and High courts. lt's an honor to have you in my court. Oh please! l've been a little tied up. - Sir, tea. - Move the fan in my direction. - So... so good to see you. - Okay. Mr. Rajpal... Yes, sure. Tell me. Delite Builders, in Noida... belongs to your relatives? Brother-in-law. Right. The Future City is fabulous. Yeah, it's wonderful. Your honor? Are you looking at something there? Yes, l was looking at a small three bedroom apartment. A three bedroom apartment only? You deserve a villa. ln fact, Judge Chatterjee bought one. - Your honor, may l call the witness? - Wait a minute. You know Judge Chatterjee... The property rates are very high... Leave it to me... l'll put in a word. Consider it done. Mr. Rajpal... one more small request... Sir, may l call the witness... -Albert Pinto... -Can't you wait for a few minutes? What's your hurry? Sorry, sir. lt's not a problem, no big deal... can be arranged. We'll catch up later. So... tell me. My witness is the eye witness, Albert Pinto. - What eye witness? - l've given the affidavit. Who is Albert Pinto? Sir. Okay, what are you doing standing over there? Stand in the witness area. Yes, that's the witness box. Are you an actor? Your name seems like it's from the movies. No, sir. - Albert Pinto. - Yes. So, according to your affidavit you testify that... on the day of the accident you were present at the spot and... you also saw Rahul Dewan. Correct? Yes, sir. Tell me, Mr. Pinto, when did the accident take place? April 20th. What was the time then? Sir, it was past midnight, l think... 1 :10-1 :15. What were you doing there? Sir, I was returning home after watching a late night film. Which film? Jodha Akbar. A copy of the complaint... hotel bills and movie ticket stubs have been submitted to the court. - Yes, Mr. Rajpal? - Sir. Do you wish to say something in this matter? Thank you, your honor. Sir, first of all, please install an A/C in the court room. lt's so hot in here. You work here all day... l mean, how do you do it? l just do it, Mr. Rajpal. l put in an application two months ago but to no avail. You should be glad there's a fan in here. Coming back to the case... what do you have to say about this? Frankly, l was busy. l was in Shimla attending my neice's wedding, so... l haven't seen the affidavit. l'd really appreciate it if you gave us another day. l'll give another date. l hope you don't have an objection. No objection, your honor, but only a request. lf you could order Rahul Dewan to be present at the next hearing... Mr. Pinto could identify him. That could speed up the process. This is a court, Mr. Tyagi. You can't speed up anything. And l don't understand on what grounds... is my client being further victimized. Mr. Rajpal, I'm here. Leave it to me. Your client is not being victimized. Anyway, l'm sure the boy is bored sitting at home... let him visit my court. l am giving a further date. Mr. Rajpal... the court has ordered Rahul Dewan to be present at the hearing. Your comment? We'll respect the court order, what else? And, what if Mr. Albert Pinto identifies him? Meenal, if you ask silly questions like this, he might identify you. Do you know the evidence he has? Do you? A cinema ticket... Jodha and Akbar? Come on, Meenal, ask some smart questions. Mr. Tyagi... do you consider today's court proceedings a small victory? Yes, of course. lf the court has ordered him to be present, one thing is certain. Many critical points in this case deserve to be reinvestigated. Sir, we have a special program on this case in our studio tonight. Can you attend? Of course, I'd be glad to. - Will you send a pick up? - Thank you. Certainly, sir. Thank you. - Sir, a photograph please. - Okay. What's this, Mr. Kaul? This is your chamber. But Mr. Kaul... This is a big lawsuit. You need a decent office. The media will want interviews... you need to make an impression. And so, the canteen is shut to make room for your chamber. Mr. Kaul, l can't afford to pay the rent. Who asked you for rent? Do you think l'm that petty? - But, Mr. Kaul... - No ifs or buts. This is your chamber. You will carry out your work here. Okay. l'll send tea. This is great. Congratulations on the chamber. Great! What's the deal with Mr. Kaul? Don't you know? Have you seen the photo on his counter... a girl's photo? Who is she? She was Mr. Kaul's daughter. A cop's son raped and murdered her. The evidence was stacked against the cop's son. Rajpal represented him. He turned the whole thing around... and the cop's son was freed in six months. While Mr. Kaul has been running this canteen for 15 years in this court. He is surrounded by judges and lawyers but... he couldn't get justice for his only daughter. You could say that you are the balm for his wound. Tell me, are you coming to Meerut tomorrow? - Yes. - Sure? Okay, bye. Whom do you want to meet? Do you have a letter or do you want advice? My dad is not at home. l'm sorry. You don't have to say sorry. lt's only been three months... since we last met, right? There's nothing to be upset about. Don't be emotional. l'm crazy to get anxiety attacks and become upset. l'm sure you've found someone else in Delhi. What nonsense! l apologized... pardon me. Are you going to torture me? You want to kill me? Break my neck? Go ahead. Jolly, let me go... You think only you missed me, and l didn't miss you? l didn't miss you? l couldn't help it... l was trying to settle down. l have a gift for you. - Can l open it? - Of course! l will hit you! lt's a shaving kit. - To hell with your gift! - What's wrong? Don't you like it? l couldn't come empty handed to ask for your hand in marriage. l had to get something for your dad. After all he is my future father-in-law. You mean it? l kept my word like l had promised you. ls that so? Jolly has grown a little wiser. Why not? Jolly has become Advocate Jagdish Tyagi. People in Delhi look up to me. And why won't they? You're fighting a big lawsuit. Jolly... you know what... l want to see your 'Objection, my lord' argument with a judge. So, come over. Next week is an important hearing. You will like it. - Sure? - l got something for you... where did l keep it... here it is! "My beloved is.." "My beloved is very sweet, handle him with love." "May you do not do anything today.." "..but take a booze and dance." "Take a booze and dance." "My beloved is very sweet, handle him with love." "May you do not do anything today.." "Take a booze and dance." "May you live in any city. You must taste this drink in life." "lf heartbroken or troubled by your fate.." "..it relives you of all the tensions." "Take a sip and be my chick." "l'd be your hero." "My beloved is very sweet, handle him with love." "May you do not do anything today.." "..but take a booze and dance." "Take a booze and dance." "O frenzied, you never know what blotto and gist it carries." "Slowly and stealthily, your illness increased." "Baby milk is recently stopped.." "Roam around the lanes and fall down the gutter." "Your beloved is.." "Your beloved is very sweet, handle him with love." "Do some other chores as well." "Go, take a booze and dance." "Take a booze and dance." lce? No... thanks. We have time. ln a few days we will figure something out. l don't believe this. That Pinto guy will identify Rahul at the next hearing. And all you can say is 'don't worry'. Mr. Rajpal, I've got to admit, l am nervous. And l'm nervous because l think you aren't confident. That's not true. l am confident. But... l have to admit that that guy has got us thinking, he has. l don't understand why are we still thinking. l mean, l suggest... let's buy this Jolly. Mr. Dewan... please... please don't use your head on matters that you don't understand. First of all... - who is this Jolly? - Exactly what l'm saying. - Who is this Jolly? - Who... who is this Jolly? - Why are we even thinking? -No, no. What... He is nothing. He is nobody. l can ruin him with one text message. One bloody SMS, that's it. Then, do it. lt is this Albert Pinto that is the problem... Honest bloody lndian. He thinks it's a cakewalk to testify in court. lt is this witness that has got the media interested in the case again. That's the problem. Mr. Tyagi... Pinto! What's up? You wanted to see me? Nothing important. l thought I'd have a word with you. Tomorrow is the hearing in court and l'm anxious. l know. All you have to do is identify... Rahul Dewan in courtand everything will be fine. Actually, l wanted to ask you... what if l refuse to identify Rahul Dewan? Will it be a big problem? What are you saying?! No, I mean, what if l... you know, turn hostile in court? Turn hostile? l know it's difficult to stand up to them... but we're doing this for a noble cause. We want justice for the deceased. Justice? Are you really fighting forjustice? You are using me to advance your career. Let's get to the point. The Dewan family has offered me a deal. 20 million rupees. You get 10 percent. And tomorrow no matter what l say, don't say a word. What do you think? Deal? You are unbelievable! l thought you were a... But you're making a mistake. The Dewans' are worth more than 2 billion. 20 million is loose change for them. Take me along with you to negotiate. Let's renegotiate and ask for 50 million. Rajpal is afraid you will testify. - 50 million, huh? - Yeah. - Rajpal is afraid? - Yeah. He's afraid of you? You are so naive! You think... the Rajpal who orchestrated this entire plan, is afraid of you? l'm no eye witness... l didn't watch any film... l didn't stay at the hotel or go to the cops. l work for Mr. Rajpal. Rajpal sent you to me? Shocked? He likes doing this. You've just begun your practice. You will have many more similar experiences. But you are lucky. ln two months you've become popular in the media. l've heard you've also got a chamber. Congratulations on the success. Think about it, Jolly. Even if you refuse, l will turn hostile in court. But you get 2 million to play along. What say? 2 million. Smart decision. Here is your advance. The rest will come after the case is dismissed. Okay? And, one more thing... send an SMS to Rajpal... to say thank you. He will like that. lt was the Maharashtra state versus Gokhale. And the presiding judge was Ranade... hang on... Here's your money, Mr. Rajpal and... please get my son out of this mess, once and for all. Mr. Dewan... What's this? This is the cheque for 3 million which you had given me. l will take this back only when Rahul is completely free of this mess. Thank you so much, Mr. Rajpal. Vivek, keep this safe. Yes sir. And Vivek... you don't be greedy. You are a genius, sir. l agree. l only demand what l deserve... and nobody calls me greedy. There you are. You said you would pick me up at 7 pm. Your phone was also switched off. lt's good that Vasu picked me up from the bus stand. l still need to learn. l have a lot to learn. l was under the impression that... l held the remote control in this lawsuit. But hats off to Rajpal. Brilliant. l am impressed, Mr. Rajpal. No wonder the world bows down to him. Brilliant! He is unbelievable. What's wrong? l don't understand. l still don't understand... whether l've lost or gained with this deal. What deal? Remember Albert Pinto? He works for Rajpal. What?! Yes. They struck a deal and everything is over. And we got 2 million. lt's a loss! Jolly, it's a loss! The idiot conned me and took everything. l could've got at least 5 million. lf Pinto had to identify Rahul Dewan, Rajpal would call me. A big loss! But this wasn't my game, so what's to lose. lf Pinto got 20 million... we've got 2 million! And Sandhu, 2 million is a lot of money. Look... here's the 200,000 advance. Why did you do this? What's got into you? All your hard work for this lawsuit... was only about a deal? And the six laborers who died that night? Fighting for their justice is meaningless? Why are you screaming at me? What have I done? Should l let go of an opportunity to make some money? lt's my profession. You are a lawyer by profession. What you are doing now makes you a broker. What's wrong with being a broker? l am a broker. You think l'm dreaming of winning this lawsuit? l'm not that stupid. Fate gives me a chance and l should let it go? l'm not doing this for myself. l'm doing this for you... l'm doing this for our future. What have I demanded from you, Jolly? A mansion, a luxury car... was it just my dream? Did I tell you to come to Delhi? Why are you blaming me for your weakness? Even if l accept that you are doing this for me... tell me something... what have l demanded from you that you stooped so low today? What are you talking about? Who has stooped low? Have you lost it? And if you can't stand this broker... why don't you find yourself an honest man to live with? What did you really want? To be featured in the newspaper, fame, interviews, right? You could've achieved that by honest means too. lf you still have any sense left, think about it. You've lost big time in this deal. No, that's not him. Mr. Pinto, you've written in your affidavit that... you saw Rahul Dewan that night. Are you sure this person is not Rahul Dewan? Well... I'm sure it's not him. l saw a picture in the newspaper and l thought I could identify him. Do you realize the importance of your testimony to this case? l do, sir. But l can't accuse an innocent person for the sake ofjustice. Right. Mr. Tyagi... do you wish to say anything? No, your honor, l have nothing to say. Please be quiet. This is a court room, not a theatre. Mr. Tyagi, your witness is turning hostile. You could lose this case. Say something. No, your honor, l have nothing to say. Okay, fine. l guess the two parties have agreed amongst themselves. That saves the court's time. l'll set the date for another hearing. We'll see how it goes. Jolly... very good! People will cite you as an example of success. l'm proud of you. Very good! l thought you would get about 700,000 rupees... but 2 million is mind blowing! You've done it. Some day you will be a bigger lawyer than Rajpal. How do you know? Such deals never stay hidden. By now it would've spread like wildfire. l hope I did the right thing. Right? lt's a genius master stroke. You leave. Mr. Kaul, today... - Mr. Kaul? - No... All your hard work for this lawsuit... was only about a deal? And the six laborers who died that night? Fighting for their justice is meaningless? Sir, would you mind stepping away a few feet? My family and l sleep here at night. Albert Pinto the key eye witness in the Rahul Dewan... accident has turned hostile and... the PlL has once again lost steam. Seems like another victory for. Tejinder Rajpal. What's shocking is that... ever since Albert Pinto turned hostile in court... neither he nor his lawyer Jagdish Tyagi are traceable. His silence as Mr. Pinto turned hostile is a mystery. This whole incident sheds light on one fact... a poor man's life is cheaper than a rich man's vehicle. Well known Bollywood sound recordist... Mr. Jagdish Tyagi... Good afternoon, sir. l've come from Batra Automobiles, to deliver your car. Here are the keys to your car. lt's second hand but brand new. Let me show you the features. Power steering, power windows... And of course, the engine. lt's amazing. Step on the accelerator and you'll zoom to 100 in no time. You'll love it. And the color is fabulous too. What... What are you doing, sir? Always this tie with this suit, please. Why do you have to be emotional? Consider yourself fortunate that... you are fighting a case against me this early in your career. For every case l've won... the opposition lawyers have hung my portrait in their chamber. They send me gifts for Diwali. Sibal, his first case was against me, you know that. Slammed him, slammed him completely. And he's always been so grateful. This is for him, by the way. People will say that... since he is fighting against Rajpal, he must be good. lt makes their career. 2 million is a significant amount for a lawyer like you. Keep it. My thoughts are a little different. lf other lawyers can make a career out of losing to you... defeating you will transform my life. l haven't even begun fighting this case. And yet that's what you think. You're a nobody. What can you do? l hail from Meerut. lf l want to, l can turn your life upside down! Emotional fool... Jolly you... goddamn it! l don't get you anymore. l told you not to file the PIL, but you ignored me. And when things are falling into place... you've returned the 2 million to Rajpal? Have you sold your common sense at the town fair? Think about it. Sandhya will come back in a few days and everything will be normal. Think practically. To hell with practicality! l want to fight this case. Tell me... will you help me? So, you won't relent? Fine... so how may I help you? Don't you have good contacts with Delhi cops? After the accident took place, Rahul Dewan's car was recorded on video. That video tape wasn't presented to the court. l want that video tape. lt is difficult but... one man can do it. Guruji. Greetings to all senior officers from Sergeant Ram Gopal Varma. Please take your seats. Let's begin. Tonight we're bidding for a posting at the Sadar Bazar police station. And l've been ordered that the base price is 2 million. Moreover, l've received a special order... to select officers with a clean image. Let's begin the bidding. 3 million. 3.5 million. Chauhan, didn't you hear, he wants 'officers with a clean image'. The CBl is investigating you in the Gurgaon Land Grabbing case. As if you are a saint, Gupta. What about the Hawala racket you were in? Mr. Chauhan, you have four children and yet you're behaving like one. Washing each others dirty linen. Unbelievable! Let's start with a clean mind, okay? 4 million. Another 'clean image officer' gets in the ring. He was released on bail six months ago. A rape case is pending against him. And what about the guys you hang out with... want me to divulge the details? Gupta, don't force me to spill the beans. lf you have the guts, bid. Don't gossip like women. 4.5 million. 5 million. - 5.5 million. - 6 million. - 6.5 million. - 6.5 million. 6.5 million. Yes, now that's solid bidding. But it's a tie. lsn't there any officer with a clean image who can match their bid? - Guruji... - Yes. How about me? Mr. Bhatnagar, l attended your wedding. Very good. What's the case against you? Guruji, Delhi University, 2006. A case of eve-teasing. Eve-teasing? That's not even a charge! Step forward please. You were charged for eve-teasing? Please come ahead. Mr. Bhatnagar, the police department is proud of you. - Do you know that? - No, sir. l'm walking around feeling good about him. 6.5 million going once... twice, thrice! Sandeep Bhatnagar, deposit the amount next week and... collect your appointment letter. - Okay? - Thank you. Yeah, right. Now hold on... Sandeep Bhatnagar, Sadar Bazar police station. Round of applause. Come. - Hello, Guruji. - Hello, Bhanupratap, how's it going? Pratap... Oh yes, Pratap, the lawyer. Your work will get done. You just need to pay 500,000. We can't afford that. Some concession, please. So, tell me what can you afford? Guruji, 100,000. Come on! Guruji, he's a new lawyer, fighting an important case. Please don't refuse. Our only hope is you. l know you never refuse the just. That's fine but you've put me in a quandary. Do you fight dowry related cases? Yes, Guruji. Fine, let's do this. 100,000 as down payment right now. And for all the dowry cases that come your way, l get 15 % commission. Don't think, there's no time. lt's the new moon festival. My wife is hungry at home waiting for me. Come on... Alright, Guruji. Good. Here's the cash. Okay. Wednesday you may collect the CD. Mohan... wait. Drop me off on the way. What did you do? 100,000 and a year's commission... l'm being honest for the first time in my career. Let's give it all we've got! Your honor, can l ask what's going on in this court room? ls this a new game after Albert Pinto? What's this CD got to do with this case? You honor, l don't think Mr. Rajpal has watched this CD carefully. - Vasu, rewind it. - Yes. Enough. DL-5C-B-3101... this car is registered to Yograj Dewan. We have submitted the registration and purchase related documents. You may check the same. Switch on the lights. Your honor, I would like to call the constable... who recorded this CD as the next witness. l am sorry, your honor. l think kids these days learn law from Hindi feature films... and become lawyers. May l present this, may l present that... Are you inviting people for your wedding? Someone please tell him that before you call a witness... you need to give advance notice. To the court as well as the defense. And you can present a witness only after you have permission. Your honor, I know it's my mistake but... l'm requesting you... Present the witness at the next hearing. Your honor, I have put in a lot of effort to get this witness here. Please, l beg of you. Don't be stubborn now. - Please, sir. - Mr. Rajpal is your senior. lf you learn some regulations from him, it won't harm you. Rules and regulations are meant to aid the law. Don't allow them to be used to bury the truth. lt's these loopholes that help people like Rajpal manipulate the law. What did he say, manipulate? No one has ever been so disrespectful to me. What do you mean? l will teach you about respect after the case is through. Hold on... Mr. Tyagi. What do you mean, later? Tell me now! Stop this! l'll slap you so hard, all your descendants will turn out deaf! How dare you talk to me like that, idiot? Listen... l am here to sort it... Don't you dare insult. Bloody buffoon! Your honor, please tell him. l will beat him to pulp. Where's my gavel? That's enough! You don't even give tea on time and now you can't find the gavel? That's enough! lf this is how you want to come to a decision... please fight outside the court. Don't ruin the dignity of my court. Mr. Rajpal, you are a senior lawyer. l pick up so many things from you. Sir, how could you lose your cool? You're right... l got carried away. - l shall be a little more careful. - Yes, you better be. You can go now. Mr. Jolly... what are you doing here? You should be an actor. 'l'll slap you so hard, all your descendants will turn out deaf.' This is a court. And in here, a lawyer's image is everything, do you get it? You've just begun practicing law... why are you ruining your image? You can't fight a case by being emotional. Sir, I'm a lawyer, not a clerk. l'm fighting for the truth. lf l do get emotional, how does it matter? You are so good with dialogues. You are fighting for the truth? What happened to you the day... Albert Pinto turned hostile? Were you observing silence? Young man... the law may be blind, but the judge isn't. He can see everything. Now you may leave. l'm sure truth is waiting for you. And if you find it, give my regards too. l can't eat anymore. Things are getting out of hand, Mr. Rajpal. Every time we think it's the end, something new comes up. How did they get the CD? We trusted you, Mr. Rajpal. Mr. Dewan, have some faith in me. Everything will be fine in a few days. But nothing is right, Mr. Rajpal. That so-called lawyer... managed to get the CD from lnspector Rathi's police department. And you're still saying, give me some more time. How? We have not spared any money... but it's getting us nowhere. We gave Pinto 20 million, but how did that help? Why bring Pinto into this? He did his job. - Why not bring Pinto in? - He did his job. That money is not wasted, by the way. lt's not about money, Mr. Rajpal. This is tarnishing the family reputation. l understand. lf you don't mind... Do you want us to consult some other lawyer? l mean, l can speak to Kapil... or... Mr. Jethmalani... Mr. Dewan... - are you doubting my ability? - No, I don't. But at my age, l don't want to see my grandson rotting in prison. We want you to deliver, Mr. Rajpal. l can't believe this. What the heck! Let's go. You think you're smart, huh? Just because you're featured in the media, you think you're a star? Don't know how to talk to your seniors? This is merely a warning. lf you insult Mr. Rajpal again, you will regret it. Listen... give Mr. Rajpal a message from me... Beat him up. You want to insult Mr. Rajpal? Don't spare him. Hit him. Don't spare him. Hit him. He wants to take on Rajpal! Your honor, last time he played a CD, in fact a film... and tried to be the hero. l admit the Land Cruiser in the CD belongs to my client. l also admit that the CD was created on the day of the accident. But that accident has nothing to do with this case. ln fact, it is a sheer coincidence... that both accidents too place the same night. And that's why... l'd like to call my client's... - What's he name? - Kamlesh Rawat. Kamlesh Rawat. As witness please. Hurry up. Tell the court what happened that night. Your honor, I was returning home after dropping off Rahul at a party. What was the time then? 12:30-01 :00... Go on... An empty road and a new car... so l picked up speed. At one turning l couldn't control and the car struck a divider. What did you do then? l called Mr. Dewan. He scolded me and instructed me to lodge a complaint with the cops. What happened at the police station? There the insurance agent shot footage of the car. That's the origin of the CD. Using images from this CD in the media, is a ploy to trap my client. And he is trying to be the hero by playing this CD. l have the police report copy and the insurance copy. You may leave. Wait a minute. Stand right there. l'd like to ask a question or two. l'm trying to learn from you. Okay... Don't worry. How long have you been driving? About 15 years. 15 years is a lot of experience. Yes. How did you manage to smash... a expensive car on an empty road at night? Like l said, the road was empty and l was speeding. But how fast... 60-70 kilometers? Not faster, right? Come on, sir. lt's an luxury car, it runs at 60 kilometers in the first gear. And which gear were you on? Third gear. l was driving at a speed of 100-1 10 kilometers. Third gear, huh? Mr. Rajpal, you didn't prepare him well. l've caught his bluff. Your honor, this man is lying. The car we're talking about is automatic. lt doesn't have manual gears. How could he be driving in the third gear? Your honor, the car documents have been submitted. You may check the same. Your honor... he is nervous because this is his first time in a court room. My request is if you could take his statement in the next hearing. Your honor, he is nervous because he is lying. You are lying? You know it is an offence to lie in court. l said, squat and hold your ears. Cluck like a cock. Your honor, I'd like to bring another aspect to your notice. l've been pressurized to drop this case. l've been getting threatening calls... and l was also attacked a few days ago. Sir, this is a very serious matter. l mean, look at how badly he's beaten up. We do fight in court... but we shouldn't tolerate anything like this. Then why did you send the goons? l sent them? Your actions will get you beaten up. But l have nothing to do with this. Don't act, Rajpal. You sent the goons, now be a man and accept it. ls this the way somebody speaks to a senior counsel? Why are you fighting again? l have also installed an A/C, be cool. Mr. Jolly, I agree with Mr. Rajpal that you need security. No, no, sir. l don't need security. l just wanted to tell you, that's it. l'm sure you've heard, health is wealth. l will order the police to arrange for your security. Because if something were to happen to you... we'll have to deal with another case. Right, Mr. Rajpal? Jagdish Tyagi... Mr. Jolly? Yes? Sergeant Haldiram, your bodyguard. lt took 30 minutes to find your place. l'm tired... of walking... can l get some water? "l had gone to pray and was forced to observe a fast." "ln scooter.." "ln scooter's fuel tank.." "Putting all his tensions.." "Wearing goggle, with nice haircut.". "Look at him.." "Everyone, look at him.." "Wearing goggle, with nice haircut.". "Look, the crow wants to be a swan." "There will be chaos in the jungle." "Look, the crow wants to be a swan." "Mr. Chaube! Mr. Chaube!" "Mr. Chaube went to be Choppe.." "..but he returned as Mr. Dube." "Mr. Chaube went to be Choppe.." "..but he returned as Mr. Dube." "What rate do we give him? What price you'd get for him.." "..when our coin is fake." "Look how his fair skin became dull." "Look, the crow wants to be a swan." You look good. Why are you hiding behind make up? You don't like it? l'm trying to hide my hideousness. l'm sorry, Sandhu. Kashmiri Pulao, l made it. How's the Kashmiri Pulao? Hey Vasu. l found an eye witness in the slum, you can meet him tomorrow. Not tomorrow, l'll be right there. Don't move, l'll be there. l have to leave. l'll have dinner and then leave. And then I will drop you off at brother-in-law's place. A little more. Jolly... - Where is he? - There. This is Advocate Jagdish Tyagi, Jolly, my boss. l told you about him. Right. What do you know about the accident? l know everything, sir. lt happened before my eyes. The deceased were relatives. l personally kept the bodies in the police vehicle. Will you testify in court? You have to say what you saw. That l can't do. l'm a daily wage laborer. lf l skip work to appear in court, l won't have money for dinner. lt's tough for the poor to get justice. You don't get justice, you have to fight for it. lf everyone starts to think like you, more accidents will follow. Six people died that night, next it could be eight. But someone has to take a stand. Fine! But l can't do it. Why should I be the scapegoat? l told you everything I knew. But l won't testify in court. Why did you call me here at this hour, if you're afraid to tell the truth? Stay as you are. Whether you testify or not... l will find the truth. You think you will find it in Delhi? Go to Gorakhpur, that's where you'll find truth. What's up? Are you heading out? - How does it matter to you? - lt does. Right now everything about you matters to me. Open his bag. Don't touch my bag! No... Don't tell us what we can't do! You can't go anywhere tonight. Leave for Gorakhpur tomorrow morning. How do you know about that? How do I know? He's asking, how do l know. We are your shadow. Where you go, whom you meet... what you eat, drink... we know everything. Haldiram! That's why l was given security. You're not a child, are you? You're smart enough to figure that. Let go of the gun. Don't you recognize me? l'm Sub Inspector Satbeer Rathi, special branch. Lower your weapon. l know you and that's why I said, let go of the gun. l stepped out for a few minutes and you pulled a gun on Mr. Jolly. You do the dirty deeds and blame it on us. Mr. Jolly, I'm not an informant. l'm your bodyguard. And as long as my body will support, l will guard you. l said leave it. Okay, l'll do it. Leave it. Don't try to move. Sir, please leave. l said leave, l'll stand guard here. Don't try to move. By the time you get there, the police would've done their task. Sadakanth Mishra? Yes? Everybody stand up. lt's okay if you don't respect the judge, at least respect the law. There's no respect in lndia. Great... thank you. For once can l have warm tea? Can you do anything right? Yes, Mr. Tyagi... what would you like to say? Thank you, sir. l'd like to call upon... the investigating officer Sub lnspector Rathi. And we had submitted advance notice about the witness. Okay, call him. - Yes, stand there. - Yes sir. How're you, Mr. Rathi? All good. You are the investigating officer in this case? Yes. Can you swear that you completed all your tasks honestly? Yes, of course. l investigated all the facts honestly and diligently. These are the names of the people who were killed that night. Can you read them to the court? Read. Sir? Yes, go on. This is getting interesting. Kunwarpal, Anjani Singh, Jodh Singh, Krishna Paswan, Jeevan... Mr. Rathi. lf l tell you something, promise me you won't laugh. Yes. Ever since l took up this case, l see them in my dreams. They say you didn't investigate honestly. ln that case, why don't you call a ghost. He will tell you the truth. That's what l want to do. Because you declared one of them dead. Victim number six, Sadakanth Mishra is alive, your honor. And Sub lnspector Rathi declared him dead in the police files. l wish to call on the most important witness, Sadakanth Mishra. l object! Here we go again. You can't present a witness without advance notice. Your honor, l know l haven't given notice. But if l hadn't done this, the witness would never make it to court. Another story. This is a court proceeding. This is not a local village gathering... where anyone can walk in as they please. Your honor, this is the last chance to know the facts... to know the truth. Okay, sit down. We'll get to the truth later. Your truth can wait, sit down! Mr. Rajpal... Mr. Tyagi... go ahead and call the witness. - Sir! - Thank you. Mr. Rajpal, l'm permitting it, so it's done. Mr. Tyagi, l'm allowing you to bring the witness. But rules are rules. You cannot call a witness just like that. l am permitting it. lt's alright. Go on, bring the witness. Sir, the rules don't permit it. You have to give advance notice. Mr. Rajpal, I know the rules too. You know... l am permitting it... end of discussion. According to Supreme Court guidelines, it is not right. You cannot call such a witness, how can you call such a witness, sir? Excuse me? l said, how can you call such a witness? - How can l? - Yes. Mr. Rajpal, this is my court, not your club. You get it? Here only l can. And l am doing this. This is illegal. Mr. Rajpal, stop interrupting me. This is illegal. No... You are in contempt of court. Contempt of court? l am making an objection. There's something illegal and l'm in contempt of court? Mr. Rajpal, why are you arguing? l said, sit down. Please sit down. l will not sit. Mr. Rajpal, I am ordering you... just sit down! Sit down! Right now! - l cannot believe this... - That's enough! lt's not the end of this. l will go to the Bar Council. l am going to make a big stink of this. This cannot go on. - l cannot believe... - l said, that's enough! Not one word. l said, shut up! l don't want another word from you! Silence! ln my 30 years of my career... That such a thing has happened in court... - l cannot... - l said, silence! This is my court. Shut up! And just shut up! l'm sitting here now, sir. l am down. Get me a cup of tea... and also for Mr. Rajpal. Damn your stupid tea. So, Mr. Tyagi... what were you saying? l want to call upon Sadakanth Mishra. Go ahead. Move, please. Thank you. What's your name? Sadakanth Mishra. How are you related to this case? l am the sixth person that allegedly died in this accident. What? Can you tell the court what happened that night? Sir, we were sleeping on the footpath that night. lt was my sister's wedding. We were to leave for our village the next morning. l was woken up by a loud sound. lt seemed as if a bomb had gone off. l opened my eyes and saw a luxury car on the footpath. My relatives were writhing in pain. l couldn't figure what had happened. A boy got out of the car. He was shaken. l thought he would help... When l woke up again... l found myself in the hospital. lnspector Rathi had come to see me. Do you remember the number of the truck? No, sir. lt was a car. You are dreaming of a car. The accident was caused by a truck. No, sir. lt was a car. Don't you understand? Get up and l will explain. Come. He took me to the morgue were the bodies of my relatives lay. l told him that l was telling the truth. But he wouldn't listen... Do you think l'm fool. and he threatened to kill me. l will kill you. No, sir... please let me go. How can l let you go? l will get paid to kill you. But l'll get nothing if l let you go. l have money with me. l gave my savings of 30,000... and the jewelry l had brought for my sister to him. A cop helped me to a train for Gorakhpur and I went to my hometown. Sir, I request you to call upon the accused, Rahul Dewan... so Sadakanth Mishra can identify him. l object your honor. l'd like to cross-examine the witness first. Overruled! You will get your chance. Sit down. Rahul Dewan... please step forward. Stand there. Sadakanth Mishra, take a good look at him. ls he the same boy who was driving the car that night? Yes, sir. He is the same boy who was driving the car that night. Amazing! With all that happened today... l didn't even realize that its time for lunch. We'll resume after lunch. Sir... l request the court to reschedule the hearing... because l have an important matter in the Supreme court... if you don't mind. You have the option of sending a junior counsel. But the court will issue it's verdict today. We'll resume after lunch. Sir, did everything go well in court today? Where is he? Sir, he is locked up inside. Get him out. Who is he? Sir, Ramakanth Shukla from Gorakhpur. Not Ramakanth Shukla, you idiot. Sadakanth Mishra, the guy who limps. - Hey... - Why are you beating me up? Couldn't you tell me who you are? You didn't let me talk. Take him away. Mr. Rajpal, sir... Confirm three things for me. ls the name correct? Yes, sir. He is from Gorakhpur? Yes, sir. ls he telling the truth? Yes, sir. You let him go for 30,000 rupees! lt was a mistake, sir. Sir, please... The 30,000 will make life hell in court! - l thought you... - What? - You had worked out a plan. - Plan? - Sir, it was a mistake. - l don't want to see you again. Before the court can issue it's verdict... Mr. Rajpal, please conclude the argument. Thank you, your honor. First of all, I'd like to thank Mr. Tyagi for filing the PIL. lt was only after the PlL was filed that... new facts, new evidence, new eye witnesses emerged. But none of these facts can hold my client guilty. But your honor... l have to admit... l am a little worried. l'm worried... because people in this court room seem to be in a hurry. lt seems that the people have already decided that... Rahul Dewan is responsible for the accident. Everyone seems to be in a hurry to send Rahul Dewan to prison. But before we do that, let us examine the facts. The investigation report still doesn't tell us... what really happened that night. There is some confusion, your honor. The police report says a truck caused the accident... while the prosecution and people say it was a Land Cruiser. Police report states that six people were killed... while the prosecution and people say that five were killed. Now that brings a dead man back to life. And we have a dead man now walking in this court... who becomes the only eye witness in this case. ls this some kind of a joke? But prima facie one thing is clear that the police were incompetent. And as a part of the judicial system it is my recommendation that... the strongest action be taken against Sub lnspector Rathi. lt is people like him that give the department a bad name. lt is due to people like him that the public rubbishes the investigation. You've made a joke out of it. Set an example of him, once and for all... for the entire police department. Your honor... my client shouldn't be punished for Rathi's failure. Which brings me to a very important question. Your honor, is this court willing to send my client to prison... on the basis of a botched up investigation? And make no mistake, this is a botched up investigation. With this laughable and hilarious evidence. Because if this happens... it will be the darkest hour in the history... of the judicial system of this country. As for the five people that died... my deepest sympathies. But if you sleep on the footpath... you risk being driven over. That's the harsh reality. The rest, your honor... l leave it to your wisdom and your fine sense ofjudgment. Thank you. Mr. Tyagi, your submission. For the first time, l agree with Mr. Rajpal. lf you sleep on the footpath, you risk being driven over. lt is true. l want to ask Mr. Rajpal... ln fact, l want to ask everyone present in this court room... l want to ask you, your honor... that these people who sleep on the footpath... who are they... where do they come from? They don't have a roof on their head, they have no work, no money. Then why do they come to our beautiful city? To tarnish its beauty? But these malnourished, poor people have a right. And that's the right to justice. Which neither Mr. Rajpal, nor you nor this court can take away. Because it is our constitution that gives them this right. The constitution of India. But when it comes to theirjustice... the doors ofjustice slam shut on their face. They are made to appear in court, hearing after hearing... they are given assurances, promises... but justice? They don't get justice. High on both alcohol and wealth... driving at a speed of 120 kilometers... is young and innocent Rahul Dewan. Young and innocent... who killed five people. And Mr. Rajpal says, is it a joke? No, sir, let me tell you what is a joke! ln the last eight months... Mr. Rajpal has changed the Land Cruiser to a truck... if this case drags for six more months, he will make sure it's a train. And if it the case continues for a year, l am sure... Mr. Rajpal will convince everyone that... this man is Shah Rukh Khan and not Sadakanth Mishra. And for lack of evidence, you will have to accept it. That is a joke, your honor. This is a joke. Footpath is not meant for sleeping, isn't that what you said? But Mr. Rajpal, a footpath isn't meant to be driven on either. Trying to teach me law! l've often heard since my childhood of the wide reach of the law. And l've often heard this line in movies... 'The arms of the law are long.' That is rubbish! And if the arms of the law are long, then Rahul Dewan is in front of you. Sentence him to imprisonment. Prove that the arms of the law are really long. Please don't take it to heart, your honor... but outside this court room people laugh at you. People send jokes about you on SMS. People say you can be bought. Your honor, your reputation is at stake. Please do something. And don't do him any favor... just give him his right. That's all I want to say. Thank you, sir. Welldone, sir. Silence! Sit down. Silence! That was a nice speech. Mr. Rajpal, Jolly is special. There are two aspects to this case. The first aspect is... the first aspect is... that the police didn't perform their duties diligently. And for that, this court orders Delhi Police Department to... suspend Sub lnspector Rathi with immediate effect... and to start investigative proceedings against him. Now the second aspect. l must say that... many facts were manipulated in this case. Mr. Rajpal... you have to agree that your client is at fault. l mean, if he wasn't at fault... there would've been no need to manipulate the facts. Everyone present in this court knows... that the accident was caused by Rahul Dewan. But l am the judge. People's thoughts and my feelings... can't influence my judgment. l have to pass the judgment on the evidence. And the evidence... At the very first hearing, l know who is guilty. l sit here waiting for the evidence. That someday the evidence will arrive. Roads are dug... Buildings reach the sky... But l don't get any document... Nothing which l can accept as real evidence. The evidence doesn't come and the guilty walk away free. This is how it has always been. But not today. Not today. So... in PIL number 48693... the trial, State versus Rahul Dewan. This court finds Rahul Dewan guilty and sentences him... and sentences him under section 304 of Indian Penal Code. lmprisonment for seven years. Your honor, this is bizarre. How can you pass this verdict? Do you realize that this will not hold for even two minutes in a higher court? Do you realize that l will go to the higher court? That is your right. You may go to the High Court, Supreme Court... the President of lndia, the media, anywhere you want to go. But... today... Mr. Rajpal, your client will go to prison. You may sit down. The detailed judgment will follow soon. The court is adjourned. Congratulations! Amazing! "Tell me if I'm wrong." "lf it comes to spending.." "..anyone would declare himself broke."
