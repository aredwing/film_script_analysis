Tell me! - Go. - No! No! No! Take all this fucking money. - I warned you. - No! No! No! My God... no... No! Look what we have here. Get him, boys! This time you're alone. What are you doing here, huh? Let me go! Or is your big brother now? What is this shit? You crossed my street? You have to pay too. Look, there are two ways out of this street: work for me... either way. I will not sell the drug for you. I love this kid. I hoped that you would not say that. - Go! - No! - No! - Take sneakers! Help! Help! Help! What are you doing here? I wash my clothes. Do you like breathing? Normally, yes. Then fucks the hell out of here, old man.
