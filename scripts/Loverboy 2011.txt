Come to Constanta, you need to make a statement. - What statement? - There's a complaint against you. - From whom? - I tell you when we get there. - What if I don't feel like coming? - Why shouldn't you feel like coming? - Because I'm busy. - Can't you take a break? Yes. - Let's go. I'm waiting. - Let me change my clothes. Will you stop at a gas station, please? I need a toilet. Ok, stop. I'd like a coffee. Shall we go? Sit down!

I slipped on the floor. It was wet. I'm serious! Bring him in my office. Do you know a girl called Dani? I don't know. Maybe. I'm not good with names. Look, this is Dani. She worked in Italy in a night club. You remember now? No. Write. - Write what? - Statement. I do not know Parvu Daniela, whose photo was shown to me. You took her to Italy and after a week you sold her. She looked for you. She didn't find you, so she came to us. You remember now? No! I don't know this story. You tell us a story then. You already know everything! I don't know anything! You're the first link in this chain. You're as guilty as they are. If what this girl says is true, you won't get away with it! What girl? Give me that! Didn't I tell you not to feed him in bed? Let him starve. If he gets up, he eats! Leave this here. Cause I say so. When your mother comes back, I'll tell her how you behave. It's me who's paying you, not mom! Come and eat, grandpa! You taught him bad habits! Are you done with your show? Iron these shirts for me, I need them! - How are you? - Fine. She's ck, I booked a room for her. She wants to see you. - Hello! - Hello! Don't stay long. Talk fast and take her with you! She's in room 209. - Hi, how are you? - Hi. You left me alone there. You have no idea what those people are like. I told you where you were going. You agreed. - You said you'd stay with me. - Didn't I stay? - Did they beat you at the police station? - It doesn't matter any more. - What did you do with the money? - I saved it. Let's go somewhere, just you and me. You filthy mother fucker! If you ever come near me, I go to the police. I'll turn you in, I swear! So why didn't you? Tell me, why? You had the opportunity! Come and eat before you leave. You should eat something. I'm not coming! I don't want to leave you angry. Let's go somewhere. I'm fine, just go. Sure? Sure. I love you. I love you too. - Won't you stay and eat? - I've got things to do. - Do you trust her? - Yes. Or you wanna see her gone? - I want to see her gone. - Us too. You need to make some money. Fast! I leave you my car. Ok? Let's get a pizza! What are you doing here? Tell me what were you doing? Tell me what were you doing? Wanted a cigarette? Answer me! I'll bring you one. Here's a cigarette! Hold it! Come on, old man! Take it! Say something: ass, cunt... Start with some swearing. Cunts, asshole... That's how you start talking. - Come on! - A... - What's that? - A... A... a...? Very good! Have another smoke. Asshole. - Good. Can you say "cunt"? - Asshole. You don't want "cunt"? - Sorry I'm late. - She's Andreea, my friend. Wanna grab a drink? What do you say, Andreea? Let's go. - God, this is so cold! - It freezes your mouth! And your tongue, and your lips. - Will you come to the seaside with me? - Yes, I will. I want to switch my phone off and just lay on the beach with you. I already told my folks I'm going to the seaside with you and two friends. - Did you tell them about me? - Yes. You're crazy! If you were smart, you'd stay away from me! Let's say I'm not smart then. I won't come to your place, it's useless! If you want to come with me fine, if not, fine! Well then, I won't come to the seaside! - Fine! - Fine! This is so cool! How fast is it, Luca? About 170. - 2000 cmc? - Yes! - Let me have a try! - Come! Let's get down to business! Summer is gone soon, man! - Did you talk to them? - Yeah, you do the grill. - It takes time. They need to change their clothes. - Where are they from? Any parents around? It's ok. I spoke with them. The youngest one is my cousin. You look alike! Did you have a good vintage? Are you finished? We still have some more to do. - What's your name? - Raluca. Where are you from, Raluca? Why? Why so tense? Listen, we'll take off to the seaside later. Wanna join us? I don't know. We won't stay long. With these cars, it's an hour drive. Do you like my frog? Shall I put it On the grill? Let me talk to her! Belly up! Will you come? Look, Raluca is coming with us. - Are you coming? - No, we can't. Our parents are waiting home for us. We have to get back home. But we'll get back fast! I don't feel like going! Come on, give me a kiss! Not like that! A sweeter one. You see? That's more like it! Let's have another swim! Come! Four cocktails for the girls, and another coffee for me! Let's go! Drink faster, and let's go home! We go home now, come on! You're totally hysterical! Open the window! They'll forgive you! They're your parents! We'll come talk to them. If they have a go at you, we'll kick their teeth in! Go home and get it over with! These chicks are really crazy! Get out of the car! They drive me insane! Come here all of you! If you're afraid to go home, we'll find a solution to stay at the seaside for a few days. In a week, they will be calling for you! You have no idea what life is. You live in a cocoon. You don't know what it's like to wake up in the morning and have nothing to eat. You think these cars just popped out of the blue? You think we don't work? It's time you decide: who wants to come to Constanta and who wants to go home! She stays, she's my baby! What about you? Are you coming? I don't want to come. I want you to take me home. Ok. Let's go home. Are you coming? - I know what you are. - What am I? You will take me home, right? Yes, I will, but tell me "what I am"! Say it out loud. You are bad! Why am I bad? 'Cause I take you home? Are you hungry? Come here! Where are the guys? In Constanta. They have things to do. I'm glad. It's more quiet. What happened to you? Did you get in a fight? Are you coming? Come where? Didn't you say we were going to my parents? How can I come to your parents like this? - So what? Tell them you fell. - We'll go some other time. But you promised! Are you coming or not? We'll drop by my place. You piss me off! I'll bring you back. - You will take me home! - Yes, tonight. Look how the Danube flooded, it's beautiful! Come with me! This is my shop. I'll open a car wash soon. Is this where you bring your chicks? You're the first girl I bring here. Yeah, right... This smells so cool. Come here! What happened to your hand? I got a bruise. I'm sleepy- You said you'll take me home. - Turn around. - Why? I want to show you something. You won't leave this place. Yes I will, you'll take me home as promised. I want us to sleep together, wake up together in the morning. You said you'd take me home. Close your eyes! I had to leave. I took your scooter. I'll bring it back tonight. - What are you doing? - Shut up! Welcome, loan. Good to have you with us! Have a seat! Take your glasses! Do you recognize her? I don't know her. But she seems familiar. You don't know her? No. Let's go! God have mercy on her! I know you didn't do it. But I need your statement. Whom you delivered her to, who was in charge with her. It's your only chance. Tell me everything! I want to talk to my lawyer! You will. You think it made a difference to keep me in there for an hour? - Where are we going? - What do you mean where? To the station. Why? I'm not going! Think about what I said! Do you have my number? No. Call me! Can you take me home? Wait until the rain stops. Here's some money for the bus. I don't want money. Don't you want me to sleep here? What's the matter? Was it your first time? Why didn't you tell me? I have to go. You can keep my scooter if you want. Do you know where's Toader's house? What's your business with him? Toader? Yes, I'm looking for his daughter. Veli. That was Toader! Seriously, is this where Veli lives? Why do you want to see her? I want to talk to her. Use the front door. Good afternoon! You know where Veli is? You stay there and mind your own business! There's someone here for you. How are you? What are you doing here? I'm fine. How did you get back last night? I walked. - What's that on your toe? - A ring. - Do you like it? - No. So what! I brought you something. It's got little bells so I don't lose you any more. Thanks. Who's this, Veli? This is Luca, father. I told you about him. - What is he doing here? - He came to talk. Let him answer. Or is he dumb? Luca. Toader, animal caretaker. What's wrong with you, are you drunk? You shut up! Or you want me to hit you in front of this boy. Unmarried girls shouldn't be visited in bed. If you want to talk, go outside. We stay where we want, nothing will happen anyway! Mom, don't. Let's go! Let's talk! I want to like you. Let's make a steak! Yeah, let's! Can you slaughter a lamb? Do that again! I don't know how to slaughter a lamb. - Are we going? - I can't come right now. You go. Are you sure? Yes, I'm sure. Why didn't you tell me you're back? I didn't want to. I spoke with your mother on the phone, she asked me when are you going there to work? Just go already! The old man is fine. I'll take care of him. What else is there to do here? Will you call your mother? Why don't you talk to her, tell her what you're doing? - Did they throw you out? - No. - Where would you like to go? - Anywhere you want. You trust me that much?

No, I don't want you to operate on me. - Hi! - Hello! I didn't know Luca was living with a girl. - Who are you? - A friend. Is he here? He's in the front. I think he's sleeping. - Hey, bro! - Hey. - Who's the young lady? - A friend. I came to take you to Constanta. Are you in charge of transports now? Temporarily. What are you up to? I don't know. I'm fine right now! Who's the babe? Told you, a girl. Cute. You've had cuter ones but you never brought those home. This is serious. I like this girl a lot. I can hardly wait to leave her and get another one just as cute. - Let's go! - I'm not coming. Maybe you're right! He's not coming. What would you like? Four meat sausages, please! Wait a second! Hello! I want to speak with Luca. I'll wait here. Luca, Ramona is here, come outside! - To drink? - A beer! Have a seat. Sit down. What happened? I found a baby sitting job for a family in Constanta. I like it better. I get more money as well. I can't help you any more. It's difficult for me. I understand. When will you go? Next week. Monday. What is it? Nothing, I thought I heard someone calling you. - Did someone call me? - No, there's no one out. Are you sure? What are you doing? Coming? Get your hands off me! Let me go!! Leave me alone!

What is your mom doing in Rome? I don't know what she's doing now. Is your father there with her? - My father works on a cruise ship. - What cruise? On your mother's cruise. Sometimes I feel you've got the devil inside. Like you're mad. In anything bad there is something good and in anything good there's always something bad. When I do something bad I feel weary, and when I do something good I feel fine. How are you feeling now? I'm feeling fine. If you wanted us to break up, you'd tell me, right? Right. Hello Luca! Hello. I killed it last night because I missed my daughter. What's this? Take it away, will you! Where's Veli? I don't know. You're a hard nut, alright. Are you drunk again? What's this? Take it and make a steak. Put it in the trunk! You got married and that's the dowry? What are you doing here, dad? Let's get out of here. Come with me now! He showed up here yelling "where's Veli?" What am I? Your fucking guard? You come new or you won't come at all. Get in the car! Why should I get in the car? Veli, this boy is a punk. Come home with me! Get in the car! Stop looking at him! You won't ever come back, you hear me? What's wrong with you? Get in the car! Come on! No! I'm not coming with you anywhere! Never! Did you get that? You're not coming? Let him take it.

Yes, it's about time! This girl has some ideas in her head. We started cleaning, she wants tablecloths, menus... I like that. Watch out, it's hot! We started painting the walls. Are you against it? No. I like it too. Veli, come here! Just a second, I'm busy. What's going on? I'm dizzy! Do you have fever? I have to go to Mrs. Savu, I promised her. Please don't go! Please!

What do you want me to do about it? What do you mean? Why is it there if it's not yours? Fuck off! Go home! What do you mean? Pack your things and fuck off! Don't you worry about my problems! You were waiting for this all along. As soon as I was in trouble, you just wanted to get away. That's not true! Beat it! Where do you want me to go? I don't care. Please forgive me. I love you! I don't want to be a monster. You are my princess. I have to go away. I'm in trouble and you can't help me. I'm going with you. It's not possible. Why? Why? You can't. Don't you trust me?
