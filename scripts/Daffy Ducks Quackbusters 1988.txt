" Whoo-hoo! Success at last. Ah. Upward mobility. The smell of it. Gads, that Cubish. What a rube. Honesty in business affairs. Honesty in business affairs. How corny can you get? I mean, what's he gonna do? He can't take it with him. Oh, no? Cubish. What? No. Cut it out, would you? You must use the money for good in the world. Yeah, use it for good. Strange that you should mention that. My very intention. You took the words right out of my mouth. You must provide a service to the community. Yup. Uh-huh. Sure, sure. Community service. It's the American way. Sheesh. What a hypocrite. What a gyp. Community service, huh? I'll give him community service. I'll see to it that ingrate ghosts are wiped from the face of the Earth. I'll rid the world of disgusting ectoplasmic slime like J.P. Cubish. Nice ectoplasmic slime like J.P. Cubish. Whew. Quite artistic, if I do say so myself. Things are really looking up. Nice new office, appropriate decor... ...and me, set to embark on a potentially lucrative business endeavor. Yup, the supernatural is a wide-open field. There are crackpots out there who think they've seen a spook or something. It's supply and demand. They supply the ghosts and I demand the money. All of which is safely ensconced herein. Sixteen million, 17... Twenty-six, 27. Okay, it's all here. What's left of it, anyway. Now all I need is some underlings to boss around. After all, somebody's gotta do the dirty work. Which reminds me, where is that stupid rabbit? He was supposed to be here an hour ago. Thinks he's such a big star. Not again. Eek! What'd I say? What'd I say? I know, I know. It was what I said about the rabbit, right? Well, I take it back. He's a swell rabbit. He'll be a valued and trusted associate. All right, all right, I'll make him vice president. Cubish! I'll get you yet! Well, seeing is believing. "Daffy Duck, paranormalist. " That's right. Paranormalist. We'll be a pair of paranormalists. Get it? Perhaps you were wondering why I called you here today. Well, actually, I was just in the neighborhood, and I... You couldn't wait to lend your support to my little crusade against the undead. I tell you, it's a crisis of epidemic proportions. All these vampires, zombies and men from Mars traipsing about. The streets aren't safe. Something's got to be done about it. Okay, okay, but why me? It's your civic responsibility. The public will listen to you. A veritable paragon of wholesome family entertainment. Eck. Gee, I don't know. This was supposed to be my vacation, and... Vacation, did you say? We offer marvelous travel opportunities. Palm Springs? Well, close to it anyway. How's the Bermuda Triangle? We'll see what we can do. Hmm. He looks cool-headed enough. Time to test his mettle under honest-to-goodness field conditions. I'll give him the treatment. Gasp. - So is it a deal? - Sure, sure. Just call me if you need me. And by the way, you never looked lovelier. Heh-heh-heh. I love these novelty accoutrements. They're a riot at parties. But I wonder if that rabbit will be able to cut the mustard. Perhaps he needs a little backup. Now for some creative recruitment tactics. Porky Pig, huh? Well, you couldn't ask for a better pigeon than that. And then there are the numerous fringe benefits... ...such as our generous employee insurance policies. You may rest assured that if anything happens to you... ...I'll be well taken care of. - So are you in? - Oh, why, yes, Mr. Duck. I would dearly love to join forces with your brave band of a para... Of ghost exterminators. - Do you think you have what it takes? - Oh, yes, sir. I'll give him the acid test. Oh, and one more thing. Anyone that works with me should never get me riled. Oh, and why not? Because I'm a split personality. That's why not. I'm two people in one. A schiz... A schizophreniac. When people are nice to me, I'm sweet, gentle and loving. Hello, baby. Nice, fat little butterball. Oh, heh, heh, now, stop. But when some wise guy starts pushing me around, look out. I turn into a hideous monster. Get the idea, buster? I do. I do. Indeed, I do. And I'll be real nice and kind and gentle to you. Oh, brother. Have I got this chump going. What a knucklehead... ...falling for that split-personality monster gag. That treacherous trickster. I'll show him who's a knucklehead. I'll give him a dose of his own medicine. I hope I look scary enough. Well, I think I'll go scare some more daylights... ...out of the little butterball. Suffering catfish. I didn't realize I was that hideous. I'm not. Heh-heh-heh. Gosh, what a scaredy-cat. Anybody who'd be scared of a masquerade costume... ...is a craven little coward. Take it easy, fat stuff. I was just testing you. Good news. You got the job. You passed with flying colors. You are too kind. Hello. Daffy Duck, Bugs Bunny and Porky Pig... ...paranormalists at large. Porky Pig speaking. Yes. Why, yes, we do. We'd be happy to send you our free brochure. Daffy Duck's the name, the supernatural's my game. What's that? You say the Loch Ness monster... ...is living in your Jacuzzi? Well, call Roto-Rooter. Crank call. All I can say is, never underestimate the power of the media. The phone's been ringing off the hook ever since we started advertising on TV. What the...? Now, how did he get in here? How many times do I have to tell you? No pets in the office. Why don't you ever listen to me? You got wax in your ears? L... Ooh. Eeps! I've heard of deflation, but this is preposterous. Cease. Desist. Wait, I get you. I gotta be nicer to my slave labor, right? Chubby over there. I thought so. Say no more. I'll treat him with kid gloves. Sorry, Snuggles. I didn't mean to startle you. I may be in the chips... ...but I don't forget the little people I've stepped on along the way. I'll give you a raise. Two raises. Bonuses galore. I'll... Oops! Okay, that's it. Get out of here. Why, I ought to... What a sweet little fellow we are. But my, don't we look peaked? Sort of wan and sallow-like. How thoughtless of me to have left you cooped up in this stuffy old office. There now. Here's a nice spacious window ledge for you to stretch out on. Pardon me, Your Eminence. I have some pap... Some correspondence for you to sign. Quiet. Our commercial's coming on. MAN - and your entire family. Hello, folks. I don't know about you, but as for me, there's nothing more upsetting... ...than having a bunch of unwelcome ghosts and ghouls clanking around the house. Did you ever have one of those mornings... ...when you wake up to a whole series of unexplainable phenomena? Hey. Hey, hey, what's up, doc? What...? Ahh! What's going on around here? Where did...? Ahh! Where am I, anyway? Yeek! If you've ever had this problem... And who hasn't? - just call Daffy Duck, Bugs Bunny and Porky Pig... ...paranormalists at large. Spooks spooked, goblins gobbled, UFOs KO'd, aliens alienated... ...vampires evaporated and monsters remonstrated. Just call 555-5925. Remember, that's the same as dialing 555-KWAK. A masterpiece. Even better the 47th time you see it. But too bad the rabbit had to overact so much. Just being a pussycat is a constant hazard. Whew. They still haven't perfected flying. I thought I saw a pussycat. I'd better hide or that bad old pussycat gonna get me. No use hiding, bird. I know you're around here somewhere. You bad old pussycat. Open up. Open up, I say. Open this door or I'll knock it down. I'll jump. I've got a choice? Ahh! Fly! Fly faster! Fly harder! Fly! Fly! He's a killer! Help! Save me! Ahh! Ahh! Save me! He's a killer! Help! Ha! I gotcha. And just to make sure you don't get out and that goon don't get in... ...I'm locking the door and tossing the key out the window. There. And now, for that Tweety sandwich I've been dreaming of. Stop squirming. I can't stand a sore loser. Now for a little seasoning. There's cloves... ...Tabasco sauce... ...mustard. What? No ketchup? Well, I guess I'll just have to eat you without ketch... Help! Open the door! Help! I'm locked in with a killer! Ahh! Help! Help! Ahh! Ahh! Help! Help! Save me! Ahh! Ahh! Save me! He's a killer! Help! Sylvester. Most outrageous exhibition of wanton cowardice. Tsk, tsk, tsk. Shameful. Yeah, shameful. Sylvester, now, where have you been? What's gotten into you? He's a complete basket case. One word. Rhinoceros? Quasimodo? Monster. Why, that's just a little old canary bird fluttering in the breeze. You yellow dog of a cowardly Sylvester, you. Now, Sylvester, come on off of there. Yes, yes? - Hmm. Yes. - You ought to be declawed... ...you silly ninny, you. Okay, that's it. You're done. Fired. Pink-slipped without pay. How's about you and your darling pet... ...taking a little excursion... ...to the resort town of Dry Gulch. There's something screwy going on down there. Terror in the tumbleweeds, that sort of thing. Never fear. My eagle eye will be ever alert to anything out of the ordinar... Ordinar... To anything unusual. Gosh, Sylvester, isn't it wonderful? An all-expense-paid vacation. Hey, easy on the expenses, Jack. And take that panicky feline with you. Come along now, you pusillanimous pussycat, you. Well, Sylvester, here we are. Dry Gulch, our first assignment. Golly, I've always wanted to be... Go out West. Haven't you, Sylvester? It's so quaint and picturesque. I don't think we're ever going to find any gho... Poltergeists out here. Dry Gulch Hotel. How opportune. I hope they're not full up. Come on, Sylvester. I'm afraid we'll just have to wake somebody up. What the...? Sylvester. Oh, don't be ridiculous. Now, come on. Get down from there. I ought to clobber you. Come on, you great yellow cat, you. What now? Brother, the things I have to put up with with this idiotic cat. It's just a little teeny harmless spider, you shameless craven, you. Now, come on. I'm sleepy. I'll just ring for the night clerk. I guess they're all asleep. So I think we'd better just sign the register and look up a room for ourselves. We'll straighten the whole thing out in the morning. All right, what's the big idea pushing me? Oh, don't be such an idiot. What are you, a schizophre...? A schizophre...? A manic-depressive or something? Sylvester. What are you trying to do, wake everybody in the house? Of all the screwball ideas. Fighting with stuffed animals. Heh-heh-heh. Weren't we lucky to find an unoccupied suite, Sylvester? Now, let's go to sleep. You'll feel a lot better in the morning. Psychopathic old pussy cat, you. What...? I can't breathe. What's going...? Hey, hey, hey. Sylvester... ...what are you doing with that rope? And that razor? That settles it. Out you go. Out, out, out! What...? Get off of me. Get out of here. What's the big idea? What are you up to now, Sylvester? Sylvester, you come out of there this instant. Well? Oh, cut it out. Of all the nonsense. I guess the only way you'll be safe from the bogeyman... ...is to sleep here with me. You poltroon of a chicken cat, you. Mice. Tell me, Sylvester, is there any insanity in your family? What a lovely morning. This really is a restful place. You know, I think we'll just stay here for a week or 10 days... ...and get really rested up. Yow! Yipes! Yow! Yay! Bothered by monsters? Not to worry. Our highly-skilled professional staff... ...is equipped to handle any supernatural emergency... ...using only the most advanced techniques. My associate shall now demonstrate. My stars. Where did you ever get that awful hairdo? It doesn't become you at all. Here, for goodness' sake. Let me fix it up. Look how stringy and messy it is. What a shame. Such an interesting monster too. My stars, if an interesting monster can't have an interesting hairdo... ...then I don't know what things are coming to. In my business, you meet so many interesting people. Bobby pins, please. But the most interesting ones are the monsters. Oh, dear, that'll never stay. We'll just have to have a permanent. Now, I've gotta give an interesting old lady a manicure... ...but I'll be back before you're done. So, folks, call Daffy Duck, Bugs Bunny and Porky Pig... ...paranormalists at large. Spooks spooked, goblins gobbled, UFOs KO'd, aliens alienated... ...vampires evaporated and monsters remonstrated. Just call 555-5925. Remember, that's the same as dialing 555-KWAK. Daffy Duck, anything for a buck. Mr. Duck, I seem to be having trouble with my kitchen appliances. Listen, lady, this ain't no electrician's. Well, it isn't quite that kind of trouble. Your ad says paranormal expert, and... Oh, I get it. Monsters in the microwave, bats in the blender, that sort of thing. No problem. Just slip into something out of this world and I'll be right over. A damsel in distress, and in a swanky part of town. Okay, so where's the fire? It's in the oven, I presume. Whoops. My mistake. Nothing a little Uzi-Off couldn't fix. Must be the frost-free kind. Whew. I could use some liquid refreshment. Say, lady, where do you keep your glasses? They're in the cupboard. Hmm. It's getting a little crowded in here. What say we mosey on into someplace a little more cozy-like... ...and talk things over. So you have these Tupperware parties often? Oh, Daffy, you're so witty. Yes, I am witty at that. How very perceptive of you to notice. Oh, Daffy, I'm so scared. And it's so comforting to have a short, dark, handsome duck... ...like you to protect me. You will help me, won't you? Sure, sweetums. It's in the bag. With a little cooperation and the proper setting... ...we could hold hands and have a seance. Handy things, these seances. Gosh, I don't know my own strength. Come on down to Papa, baby. Oh! Big, strong Daffy-waffy gonna protect little itty-bitty me? Oh, brother, not another schizophrenic dame. Hey, Sybil, any more like you in the family? Could you send back that older sister of yours? Ou-yay upid-stay erk-jay. And I thought French was a romantic language. Mary had a little lamb... ...but I ate it. So tell me, mein frulein... ...when did you start hearing these voices? Was it something in your childhood, perhaps? Buried deep in your subconscious mind? Search your memory. You're blocking. This is a little over my head. Here we are. How to Exorcise. Just the ticket. If this doesn't get her, nothing will. "One and two and three and four. One and two and three and... " Whoops. My error. Here it is. The real McCoy. "Of utmost importance in the exorcism of spirits... ...is to keep them amused. " Keep them amused, huh? I'll slay them. A guy came up to me, said he hadn't had a bite in weeks... ...so I bit him. Howdy, stranger. Just flew in from another world, huh? I'll bet your arms are tired. Hmm. They don't seem all that amused. Maybe it's a culture gap. I'll try something a little closer to home. Did you hear the one about the girl who didn't pay her exorcist bill? Her soul got repossessed. What? Who? Huh? Why, I feel like my old self again. Nothing to it, really, for one of my sophisticated wit. Uh-oh. That tickles. Oh, my hero. Y'all come back now, you hear? Whew. What a fiasco. House calls are definitely hazardous to my health. Cubish. Let's see what my nemesis has been up to in my absence. Yow! The money supply is dwindling. I'm down to my last million. Yes, please, anything. Porky Pig reporting for duty, O noble leader. Oh, it's you. So, what's the story? Any ghouls in them there hills? Sorry, sir. A perfectly uneventful trip. Except for this terrible headache. I guess I'm not used to the brisk desert climate. Well, there's something screwy going on around there, buddy. I've been getting lots of calls about suspicious-like activity. Why don't you head on down to the Superstition Mountains... ...and do some more snooping? You're bound to find some rich nut who's superstitious enough... ...to pay us royally for our services. Boldly go where no pig has gone before. Great news, Sylvester. We're off to the Superstition Mountains. Bills, bills, bills. It's positively stultifying. But I don't mind paying them. Nice bills, good bills. Can't get enough of them. Some rich sucker for the supernatural better materialize soon. Daffy Duck, paranormalist par excellence. Hello, this is a person-to-person collect call... ...to Mr. Daffy Duck from outer Transylvania. Go ahead, please. I want to bite your neck. No, no. Don't drive that wooden stake through my heart. Transylvania? Yuck! What a gruesome assignation. But still, somebody's gotta go there. I can't afford to leave any stone unturned. Ah. I got it. I'll stick the nasty job on that underemployed rabbit. After all, I did promise him travel opportunities and... - Go ahead, it's your quarter. - Guess what, pal? I pulled a few strings, sliced through some bureaucratic red tape, and... You mean I get to go to Palm Springs? Well, not to Palm Springs exactly, but someplace even balmier. Scenic Transylvania, tourist spot of the Western world. I hear it's simply breathtaking this time of year. Just call me when you get there and we'll map out your strategy. Oh! Wow, what a belt. These Transylvanian hardwoods ain't too soft. Who is that delicious young creature, Emily? Uh-oh. Good morning, ladies... Lady. Could you direct me to the nearest telephone? Doesn't he look sweet and crunchy, Agatha? Oh, well, never mind. I'll just check at that motel over there. Boy, they don't make places like this anymore. Be a wonderful place for a vacation. Sorry to disturb you, sir. I'd like to use your telephone. - I know it's late, but... - Oh, no, it's never too late. - Come in. - Yeah, well... ...you see, I just wanna call my partner in the U.S. A... ...to tell him I've arrived in your charming country. Boy, keen-looking lobby they got here. Telephones, telephones. Why do hotels always hide the telephone... ...booths. Oh, yeah. You must be the head waiter. Count Bloodcount, at your service, sir. Yeah. Well, look, Con, about those telephones. Telephones? Telephones? Oh, yes. Right this way. Say, nice little place you've got here, doc. Interesting decor. Homey, comfortable. Nice recreational facilities. Nothing like family portraits to brighten up a place, I always say. This is your room. Yeah, sure, doc, but I don't want a room. I just want a telephone. Rest first. Telephone tomorrow. Rest is good for the blood. Well, I am a little fatigued. Goodbye, little friend. I mean, good night. Asleep yet? Nope. Well, ring if you need anything. Cyanide or like that. Same old problem. I just can't sleep in a strange bed no matter how nice the place is. Hey, that's what I need, something to read. Mm. "Magic Words and Phrases. " Sounds interesting. Yeah. Uh... "Magic can be performed either by potions... ...or by the use of magic words and phrases. Among the most powerful of these... ...is the word aba... Abracadabra. " Yeah. Oh, sure it is. Sick humor. "It is to laugh magic words... " Golly, what big mosquitoes they do have around here. Hold still, you little devil. There. "Another highly useful magic word is hocus-pocus. " - Anyone we know, Agatha? - No. Splendid-looking specimen, though. Boy, I hope the restaurant's still open. I haven't eaten since I left Cucamonga. Abracadabra Another one. They ought to screen this place. Hocus-pocus I am a vampire. Oh, yeah? Well, abracadabra. I'm an umpire. Hocus-pocus. I'm a bat. Okay, I'm a bat too. Abracadabra. You wouldn't hit a bat with glasses on, would you? Hocus-pocus. Now I crush you. Abracadabra. Hocus-pocus. Abracadabra. Hocus-pocus. Abracadabra. Abraca-pocus. Pocus-cadabra. Newport News. Wow, I can do better than that. Walla Walla, Washington. Oh, girls. Emily, look. It's our little friend. Look, Emily. Isn't it romantic? I always said, four heads are better than one. Well, a telephone at last. Hello, operator? Could you please connect me with a certain Mr. Daffy Duck in New York City, U.S.A.? Abraca-pocus So, what's the bad word? Anything inexplicable to write home about? No, nothing special. But I did manage to bring together two lovely couples... ...who have a lot in common. What do you think we're running here, a matrimonial agency? Just like that rabbit. The company's crashing down around me and he gets sentimental. Let's see, now. Let's see. Form A, 62-B. I can deduct 30 thou because of my winning personality, but wait. According to schedule 77... ...since I was born in a month with an R in it... ...I can write off this, subtract that, carry the one and... These new simplified tax forms are driving me nuts. Setbacks, setbacks. Ah. I got it. I'll claim my deceased Uncle Robespierre Duck as a dependent. Ha-ha-ha-ha. What the IRS don't know won't hurt them. Nothing simpler than a little juggling of the books. Oh, come on, I like to juggle books. It's good, clean, harmless fun. See? Juggling. It's my hobby. - Uh, hello? - Himalayas. A giant monster running amok, ruining tourist trade. Come quick. Help! The Himalayas. Duty calls. I'll hop down there, make short order of this Bigfoot thing... ...and they'll generously reward me with Tibetan beads and trinkets. But, you know, giant monsters aren't exactly my forte. I could use a front man to take some of the lumps. Hmm. Sounds to me like another menial task for that dumb bunny. Transylvania, Transylvania. Where is that stupid number? - Yes? - Hello, Bugs? Daffy here. How's about a nice executive junket to...? No, not Palm Springs. To the rugged Himalayas. Seems the local yokels have a problem with some giant. Must be some kind of a native superstition. Here we are, the Himalayas. What a way for a duck to travel: Underground. Crimenetlies, it's cold. Good thing I packed my winter wardrobe. I don't see any giant. Hey, come to think of it, I don't even see any Himalayans. You know, if we just reroute through Albuquerque... ...we could probably hit Palm Springs by this afternoon. You and your one-track mind. First things first, buster. There's still the little matter of this giant to take care of. Guess I'll backtrack a bit. I must have missed something on the way. All right, what's holding up the works? What's all the...? Ahh! Oh, what a cute little pink bunny rabbit. Just what I always wanted. My own little bunny rabbit. I will name him George and I will hug him... ...and pet him and squeeze him. I'm not a bunny rabbit. And pat him and pet him and... You're hurting me. Put me down, please. And rub him and caress him and... I ain't no bunny rabbit! Not a bunny rabbit, George? Then how come you have long ears? - How come? - Long ears? Those aren't ears. Those are sleeves. So now put me down, please, huh? Oh, George, you were naughty to pretend you was a bunny rabbit. I will punish you good. Bad old George. Look, doc, I know where there's a real bunny rabbit. A very cuddly and a fuzzy rabbit. And then, after a carrot burger and a malt in Albuquerque... Oh, Bugsy. Bugsy, buddy. Oh, hi. What's up, duck? Come here, old pal. My own little bunny rabbit. Hey, an abominable snowman. I will name him George and I will hug him and... Oh, sure. I know I'm a louse. But I'm a live louse. And I will give him security. And I will keep him warm like a mother hen... ...so he will never feel rejected or lack for love. Poor old Bugs. But anyway you look at it, it's better he should suffer. After all, it was me or him, and obviously, it couldn't be me. It's a simple matter of logic. I'm not like other people. I can't stand pain. It hurts me. Okay, Abom, here's your bunny rabbit. A bunny rabbit, George? - Bunny rabbit? Me? - Yes, you, doc. Very funny. Ha, ha. Very droll. Hey, Shorty... ...what do you consider to be the distinguishing characteristics of a rabbit? Uh... Distinguishing character... Yeah, yeah. What makes a rabbit look like a rabbit? Why, the long ears. And whom around here has long ears? Sorry to have to do this to you, bud. Eh. Don't give it a second thought. Oh, boy. Just what I always wanted, my own little bunny rabbit. They really do make a charming couple. Pet him and squeeze him and rub him... ...and stroke his bill and rub his pretty feathers. Hey. Wait a minute. Bunny rabbits don't have feathers and bills. I know. I know. There goes your bunny rabbit. Hey, George. Wait. Ho, ho! Look out, bunny rabbit. This I gotta see. And I searched and I searched. Whew. It's hot. But I never caught up with my little bunny rabbit. Gee, that's tough, Mr. Adomin-abable. And now I'll never... Gosh, it's hot. - Never see my bunny rabbit again. Don't give up hope, yet, doc. If you love him, he'll come back. Well, here I am. Massacre started yet? Fireworks gone off? Balloon gone up? Oh, boy. A bunny rabbit. Just what I always wanted. I will name him George. And I will hug him and squeeze him and pet him and pat him and... Hey. Hey, what do you know? He melted. He really was a snowman. Abominable, that is. Ahh! Eek! Still bothered by monsters?

Daffy Duck, ace paranormalist, at your service. Hello? Hello, Mr. Duck? I wanna report an elephant in my birdbath. I beg your pardon, sir. You say there's an elephant in your birdbath? Uh-oh. An obvious nutcase. So there's an elephant in your birdbath. Huh? Yeah. Yeah, well, how does he fit in it, sir? Yeah. I see. The elephant in your birdbath is only 5 and a quarter inches tall. Definitely non compos mentis. Better summon the authorities. No, no. You wait right there, sir. Somebody will be coming to call on you very shortly. - Now, what was that address again? - 112 North Highland. Yeah, that's right. Please, hurry. Steady, now, lad. Easy does it. But I did. I did see an elephant in my birdbath. Sure, sure, I know. I keep a giraffe in mine. You're late. He always used to be pink. And Mother used to scold me when I was only 3. She'd say, "Dolores, you're not seeing little lavender men in the sugar bowl. " But I did, doctor. And then when I went to nursery school, my teacher, Mrs. Swanson... She was a synthetic blond. Well, Mrs. Swanson used to spank me, spank me hard, even with... I think it all began when Father refused to take me to the circus. I was a fragile child of 6. Say, this teensy-elephant thing has spread like wildfire. Right up my alley. A golden opportunity to go on TV and placate the citizenry. It can't fail. I'll soothe their troubled brows... ...and be showered with goodies by a grateful populace. Good evening, I'm Zed Toppel, and this is Frightline. Tonight, the miniature elephant. Is it real, or is it merely a figment of our overactive imaginations? A product of our troubled times. Our guest is the noted metaphysician, Mr. Daffy Duck... ...who may be able to shed some light on this otherwise dark corner... ...of our national obsession with... - Yeah, sure. Thank you, Zed. Folks, this so-called miniature elephant couldn't possibly exist. Now, I can accept something plausible. Ghosts? Okay. Vampires? Fine. - But itsy-bitsy elephants? That's silly. - Ha-ha-ha-ha. That's just stupid. That's not even... Yike! The insult. The ignominiousness. Publicly disgraced on a coast-to-coast hookup. Wait a minute. I can still get out of this. It's that TV station. I'll sue them. It's their fault. No, wait. I was simply misinformed. It's my advisor, that pig. The perfect patsy. Nobody will believe him. He's a nincompoop. Yeah, that's it. It was his fault. Yeah. Who's to know? What the hay? There's nothing wrong with a little dishonesty in business affairs. What am I saying? I'm finished. Strapped. Kaput. Ah-ha. It's the door. Opportunity knocks.
