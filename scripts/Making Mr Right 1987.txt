[MUSIC PLAYING] Man: CHEMTEC GIVES US AMERICA'S FUTURE TODAY, BRINGING SPACE INSIDE THE AMERICAN HOME. AND NOW IT IS DEVELOPING ITS MOS EXTRAORDINARY CREATION YET, THE ULYSSES ANDROID, DESTINED TO REVOLUTIONIZE THE AMERICAN WAY OF LIFE. DEVELOPED HERE AT CHEMTEC LABORATORY UNDER MY DIRECT SUPERVISION, ULYSSES IS THE CLOSEST THING TO MAN HIMSELF. THE FUTURE APPLICATIONS FOR SUCH AN ANDROID ARE VIRTUALLY INFINITE: HANDLING HAZARDOUS CHEMICALS, DETECTING RADIATION, DISARMING EXPLOSIVES, FIGHTING FIRES, TEST-PILOTING NEW AIRCRAFTS, AND, OF COURSE, EXPLORING SPACE. THE AWESOME DISTANCES, PROLONGED PERIODS OF TIME, AND TORTUOUS CONFINEMEN HAVE MADE DEEP SPACE EXPLORATION PROBLEMATIC FOR THE HUMAN PILOT. WE BELIEVE THE ULYSSES ANDROID IS THE ANSWER. OK, I THINK I'VE SEEN ENOUGH. BRUCE? WHAT DO YOU THINK? WELL, IT'S NO GONNA WIN ANY OSCARS. AND WHAT'S MORE IMPORTANT, WE'RE LOSING OUR FUNDING IN CONGRESS. THAT'S WHY WE CAME HERE. WE NEED TO MAKE PEOPLE SEE HOW IMPORTAN THIS PROJECT IS. MISS STONE... THE ULYSSES ANDROID IS AN AMAZING PIECE OF EQUIPMENT. YEAH, BUT... I'M NOT USED TO PROMOTING HARDWARE, DOCTOR. I PROMOTE PEOPLE. POLITICIANS, BUSINESSMEN, THE OCCASIONAL ROCK STAR. DR. RAMDAS... DO YOU KNOW WHO CONTROLS MOST OF AMERICA'S TV DIALS AND BUYS 72% OF ALL MAGAZINES? WOMEN. AND IF THIS PUBLICITY CAMPAIGN IS GONNA WORK, THAT, GENTLEMEN, IS YOUR TARGET GROUP. THIS SOUNDS LIKE SOMETHING YOU COULD DO IN, SAY, 35 DAYS? ONLY IF I CAN PUBLICIZE THE ANDROID MY WAY, AND THAT MEANS FULL MEDIA SATURATION. AND I PROMISE YOU, BOYS, I'LL HAVE EVERYONE IN CONGRESS ITCHING TO FUND YOUR PROGRAM BEFORE YOU CAN SAY E.T. WELCOME TO CHEMTEC. PARKING IN LOT C. THANKS. WELCOME TO CHEMTEC, MISS STONE. OH, DR. RAMDAS, IT'S A PLEASURE. QUITE A FACILITY YOU'VE GOT. WELL, THANK YOU. IT'S THE WAY OF THE FUTURE. YOUR VISITOR'S PASS. WOULD YOU FOLLOW ME, PLEASE? SURE. P.A.: PAGING DR. NIPATOE. DR. NIPATOE TO ROBOTICS, ROOM D, PLEASE. DR. NIPATOE... THIS IS WHERE ULYSSES WAS BORN. IN THE FUTURE, MAKING LOVE WILL NO LONGER BE NECESSARY FOR THE CREATION OF LIFE. IT CAN ALL BE DONE FAR MORE EFFICIENTLY IN THE LAB. HOW ROMANTIC. OF COURSE, I MYSELF PREFER THE OLD-FASHIONED WAY. WHY DON' YOU WAIT IN HERE? I'LL SEE IF DR. PETERS IS FREE. I KNOW HE'D LIKE TO MEET YOU. OKEY-DOKEY. OH! OH, HI, YOU MUS BE DR. PETERS. I'M FRANKIE STONE. WHAT DO YOU CALL THESE? WHAT? OH--WH-- WHAT ARE YOU-- YOU'VE BEEN IN THIS LAB TOO LONG, BUDDY! P.A.: PAGING DR. STEVENSON. YOU'RE WANTED IN IMAGE PROCESSING, DR. PETERBERG. OH, MY GOD! I KNEW IT! ONE MINUTE WITH A WOMAN AND HE SHORT-CIRCUITS. MY GOD, HE LOOKS LIKE YOU! WHAT DID YOU THINK HE'D LOOK LIKE, AN ERECTOR SET? WHAT'S THE MATTER, NO MAN EVER LOSE HIS HEAD OVER YOU BEFORE? [SNORTS] HE LOOKS SO REAL. HE--HE-- HE IS REAL... IN HIS OWN WAY. METAL, PROTEINS, SYNTHETIC FIBERS. HE'S NO DIFFEREN THAN YOU OR I. WHAT'S THAT? THAT--I-I-- IS HIS RESET BUTTON. IT REACTIVATES HIS MOTOR CONTROL. I TOLD RAMDAS THAT THE CONCEP OF A WOMAN WOULD MERELY CONFUSE HIM. ULYSSES, STOP PLAYING GAMES. ULYSSE-- ULYSSES! HERE. OH--UH! [BEEP BEEP] Dr. Ramdas: I THOUGH SHOWING YOU THESE TAPES MIGHT HELP TO MAKE YOU MORE FAMILIAR WITH THE DROID. YOU SEE, MISS STONE, PROGRAMMING THE ANDROID TAKES HIM JUST SO FAR. THE REST MUST BE LEARNED LIKE A HUMAN CHILD. WE HAD SOME DIFFICULTY WITH HIS GROSS MOTOR FUNCTIONS BEFORE WE MODIFIED HIS CEREBRAL MUSCULAR COORDINATION. [FRANKIE GIGGLES] Dr. Peters, severely: EDGE PERCEPTION, MISS STONE, IS EXTREMELY DIFFICULT. [GIGGLES] Dr. Peters: IT--I MAY LOOK SIMPLE TO YOU, BUT IT REALLY IS AN INCREDIBLY SOPHISTICATED SERIES OF PROGRAMS. Dr. Peters: ONCE WE WERE ABLE TO MODIFY HIS HAND/EYE COORDINATION, WE--WE REALIZED HE HAD A RETINAL RESOLUTION 10 TIMES GREATER THAN THA OF THE AVERAGE HUMAN EYE. Dr. Peters: AND AS YOU CAN SEE, WE LICKED THAT PROBLEM. Frankie: WELL, IF ALL ELSE FAILS, HE CAN ALWAYS TAKE YOUR PLACE ON JURY DUTY. Men: HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO YOU HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO YOU HAPPY BIRTHDAY, DEAR ULYSSES HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO YOU [ALL CHEERING] AHEM. DR. PETERS, HE REALLY IS AN AMAZING CREATION, BUT I THINK THA WE MIGHT WANNA TAKE SOME TIME TO POLISH UP HIS SOCIAL GRACES. SOCIAL GRACES? WHAT FOR? JEFF, I'VE GOTTA AGREE WITH MISS STONE. I THINK A WOMAN WOULD BE A GOOD INFLUENCE ON HIM. TRISH? HI! WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE? IVY'S WEDDING ISN' UNTIL NEXT WEEK. [DOG WHIMPERING] OH, TRISH... I CAN'T BELIEVE DONALD WOULD DO THIS TO YOU! YEAH, MY MOTHER WAS RIGHT. I SHOULD NEVER HAVE MARRIED AN ACTOR. OHH... WHAT'S GOING ON? ARE YOU HAVING A GARAGE SALE? OH, YOU MIGH CALL IT THAT. I'M CHANGING MY LIFE, GETTING RID OF THE GARBAGE. OH, NO! STEVE, TOO? MM-HMM. JESUS, FRANKIE, I ALWAYS THOUGHT STEVE WAS ABOUT THE BES YOU WERE GONNA DO. BUT IT'S NICE TO KNOW I'M NOT THE ONLY ONE WHO'S BEEN DRAGGED THROUGH THE MUD BY SOME MACHO SCUM. [DOG BARKS] SNOWBALL! TRISH, IT WASN' EXACTLY LIKE THAT. YOU KNOW, FRANKIE, BEING SINGLE AGAIN COULD BE REALLY GREAT. I MEAN, YOU COULD GO WHEREVER YOU WANTED, SLEEP WITH WHOEVER YOU WANTED, HAVE ABSOLUTELY INCREDIBLE SEX WITH STRANGERS. LIKE, UM... I'VE NEVER MADE I WITH A BODYBUILDER, HAVE YOU? OR AN ACROBAT? [LAUGHING] HOW ABOU A CAR MECHANIC? A SWEATY ONE. [LAUGHS] I'VE NEVER EVEN TRIED A M\NAGE TROIS, HAVE YOU? WITH STEVE? MM-HMM. OH, GOD, IT WAS HARD ENOUGH TO GET HIM ALONE. OH. AND EVEN THEN I WASN'T HARD ENOUGH. [BOTH LAUGHING] WELL, FRANKIE, WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT IT... THERE ARE A LO OF POSSIBILITIES. Frankie: OK... THAT'S THE FIRST PROBLEM. YOU'VE GOT NICE EYES, ULYSSES, NOW USE THEM. LOOK AT ME. WHY? I KNOW YOU'RE THERE. BECAUSE LOOKING SOMEONE IN THE EYES MAKES THEM FEEL THAT YOU CARE ABOUT WHAT THEY'RE SAYING. THAT'S POINT NUMBER ONE: MAKE EYE CONTACT. AND POINT NUMBER 2 IS LISTENING. NOW, YOU LOOK AT A WOMAN, OR ANYONE, FOR THAT MATTER, AND LISTEN-- AS IF WHA THEY'RE SAYING IS THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IN THE ENTIRE WORLD. GOOD. GOOD. NOW, POINT NUMBER 3: CONFIDENCE. [INTERCOM BUZZES] JUST STAY THERE. STAY... STAY. [BUZZ] YEAH? Woman: STEVE MARCUS IS HERE TO SEE YOU. OK, UH, JUST HOLD HIM THERE, WOULD YOU? I'LL BE RIGHT UP. ULYSSES, WHY DON' YOU WATCH THIS FOR A LITTLE WHILE, OK? THEY HAVE NOBODY. Phil Donahue: YOU ALSO ARE, LIKE-- I'M VERY PLEASED THAT YOU WOULD BE-- OH! HERE. HERE. THIS IS A TALK SHOW. NOW, YOU'RE GONNA BE ON ONE OF THESE IN A COUPLE OF WEEKS, SO I WANT YOU TO STUDY, OKEY-DOKEY? OKEY-DOKEY. HOW 'BOUT, SHOULD YOU MARRY, WHAT ABOUT CHILDREN... I'LL BE RIGHT BACK. BIOLOGICAL CLOCK, ALL THAT STUFF? YES, MY BIOLOGIC CLOCK IS COUNTING DOWN, AND, UM, I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE CHILDREN. AND, UH, RIGHT NOW, I JUST TRY TO PSYCH MYSELF OU OF NOT HAVING CHILDREN BECAUSE I DON'T THINK THEY'RE IN MY FUTURE. UM, ARE YOU LOOKING FOR MR. RIGHT? YES. YES, BUT-- ISN' THAT A TRAP? IS THERE SUCH A PERSON? P.A.: ATTENTION, WELDING TEAMS C AND D... HI. PLEASE REPORT TO ANNEX B ON C LEVEL. [WHISPERING] What are you doing here? I HAVE TO TALK TO YOU! YOU WON'T RETURN MY PHONE CA-- SHH! My phone calls! HERE. WHAT HAPPENED TO YOUR LIP? IT'S A MUSTACHE. I FEL THAT IT WOULD MAKE ME LOOK MORE MATURE. VOTERS LIKE THAT. WELL, I'M A VOTER, STEVE. YOU DON'T LIKE IT?! SHH! Why are you here? Is there someplace a little more private where we can talk? Yeah, sure. I'LL WALK YOU TO YOUR CAR. ONE OF THE THINGS IS THAT YOU CAN'T SIT AROUND ON YOUR HOOPEY-DOOPEY WAITING FOR MR. RIGHT TO COME! Woman: SHE'S NOT DOING THAT. Man: YEAH, I KNOW, BU YOU'VE GOTTA GET OUT THERE, AND YOU'VE GOTTA LET YOURSELF BE KNOWN. YOU'VE GOTTA SAY, "HERE I AM, AND I'M WORTHWHILE." I THINK A LO OF THAT DEPENDS ON YOUR OWN IMAGE OF YOUR SELF. IF YOU SIT HOME AND TURN ON THE TELEVISION SET, DON'T EXPEC ANYTHING TO HAPPEN! GET OUT THERE AND SAY, "LOOK AT ME! I'M GORGEOUS!" Donahue: BUT THE PROBLEM IS, THERE AREN'T THAT MANY OTHER GORGEOUS, WONDERFUL PEOPLE OUT THERE! THAT'S THE PROBLEM! Man: WELL, YOU KNOW, I DON'T-- Woman: THERE ARE-- THERE ARE A LOT-- Man: I DON'T BELIEVE IT! I THINK THERE ARE! Donahue: ALL RIGHT. ARE THE--WHAT'S THE MATTER? YES, MA'AM, WOULD YOU KINDLY STAND? Second woman: YES, I AM A WIDOW. I'VE BEEN A WIDOW FOR 5 YEARS. AND I'VE FOUND OU THE BEST WAY... [BLOWS AIR] ...AND DO SOMETHING FOR SOMEBODY. [APPLAUSE] Donahue: AND WE'LL BE BACK IN JUST A MOMENT. [DONAHUE THEME PLAYING] Man: AREN'T YOU TIRED OF POLITICIANS WHO DON'T GIVE A DAMN ABOUT WHAT YOU THINK? WE ARE. WHO ARE WE? WE'RE VOTERS FOR STEVEN MARCUS, BELIEVERS IN A BETTER CONGRESS WITH BETTER CONGRESSMEN. WHAT MAKES MARCUS SO MUCH BETTER THAN EVEN THE SO-CALLED "BEST"? HE'S SENSITIVE TO YOUR NEEDS. I REALLY BELIEVE HE CARES. HE'S SMART AS A WHIP. HE STANDS FOR THE ISSUES THAT REALLY MATTER. UNA PERSONA SINCERA. I THINK HE'S JUST LIKE YOU AND ME, EXCEPT HE'S A LITTLE BETTER. Man: STEVEN MARCUS. IT TAKES A MAN THIS SENSITIVE TO KNOW YOUR NEEDS. PAID FOR BY CITIZENS FOR MARCUS. [DONAHUE THEME STARTS] Donahue: HERE'S THE POINT. IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR MR. RIGHT, THEN YOUR WELL-BEING IS DETERMINED BY... WHAT ARE YOU DOI-- IT TAKES A MAN THISSENSITIVE TO KNOW YOUR NEEDS. MY GOD, THAT W-WOMAN IS TURNING YOU INTO A HOOKER! Woman: I THINK THAT I HAVE A HOPE THAT THERE IS A MR. RIGH OUT THERE FOR ME. HOW YOU DOIN', SKIPPY? IS THAT YOUR NEW CAMPAIGN MANAGER? [LAUGHS] THAT'S VERY FUNNY. COME ON, FRANKIE. [SIGHS] I NEED YOU BACK ON BOARD. SKIPPER? TAKE A BREAK. YOU KNOW, I'VE, UH... I'VE REALLY MISSED YOU. [LAUGHS] I'M DESPERATE. I FELL THREE POINTS IN THE POLLS. MY ENTIRE CAREER IS ON THE LINE! OK, CALL THE OFFICE. MAYBE WE CAN RECOMMEND SOMEBODY. I ALREADY HAVE. I MEAN, I'M CONSIDERING, UH-- I'M CONSIDERING HIRING SUZY DUNCAN. YOU MEAN MY ASSISTAN SUZY DUNCAN? WELL, WHY NOT? SHE'S HAD SOME GOOD IDEAS SO FAR. LOOK, FRANKIE! LOOK, YOU COME BACK! WE CAN KEEP I STRICTLY PROFESSIONAL. I MEAN, WE CAN, UH-- WE COULD EVEN DATE OTHER PEOPLE! I MEAN, I THOUGH THAT'S WHAT YOU'D WANT! ISN'T IT? ARE YOU DATING OTHER PEOPLE? WELL, YEAH, I MEAN, YOU KNOW, KIND OF. AREN'T YOU? YEAH, SURE. YEAH. YEAH. JESUS, THAT WAS DAMN QUICK WORK! WE ONLY BROKE UP LAST TUESDAY! WHAT, YOU KEEP THIS GUY ON A BACK BURNER OR SOMETHING? STEVE! WELL, IT GOT SERIOUS PRETTY GODDAMNED QUICK! LOOK, I DON'T HAVE TIME TO GET INTO THIS RIGHT NOW. I'VE GOTTA GO BACK TO WORK. IT'S SOMEBODY YOU WORK WITH, RIGHT? SEE, YOU NEVER WERE VERY GOOD AT SEPARATING BUSINESS FROM PLEASURE! I NEED TO SPEAK WITH YOU RIGHT NOW. JEFF! LOOK, DON'T-- DON'T GET UPSET. THERE'S NOTHING TO BE JEALOUS ABOUT. I'M NOT JEALOUS! UH, STEVE MARCUS. JEFF PETERS. DR. JEFF PETERS. WELL, I HOPE YOU'RE REGISTERED, JEFF, BECAUSE I'M GONNA BE NEEDING YOU OUT THERE 4 WEEKS FROM TUESDAY. I DON'T FOLLOW POLITICS. [CHUCKLES] SORRY, STEVE. TAKE GOOD CARE OF HIM, SKIPPY. OK? BYE BYE. WHAT ARE YOU DOING? [WHISPERING] Shh! YOU'RE MY NEW BOYFRIEND. MISS STONE, IF I HAVE UNWITTINGLY LED YOU ON, I SINCERELY APOLOGIZE. DON'T FLATTER YOURSELF. I HATE MEN. [WOMAN MIS-SPEAKING SPANISH] IVY, MUST YOU BABBLE LIKE THAT? YOU ARE GOING TO SHAVE THOSE BEFORE THE WEDDING? HECTOR LIKES ME LIKE THIS. SHAVING'S SUCH A BOURGEOIS CONCEPT, MOM. MARRIAGE IS A BOURGEOIS CONCEPT, IVY. HOW COME I CAN' TALK YOU OUT OF THAT? SORRY I'M LATE! WELL, YOU TWO LOOK ADORABLE. WHO'S GETTING MARRIED HERE, HUH? THE WRONG PERSON. YOU COULD HAVE MARRIED THE MOST ELIGIBLE BACHELOR IN ALL OF MIAMI IF YOU'D PLAYED YOUR CARDS RIGHT, AND YOUR SISTER HERE INSISTS ON MARRYING A BUSBOY. HECTOR AND I ARE IN LOVE, MOM! WHAT'S LOVE GOT TO DO WITH IT? FRANKIE AND STEVE HAD A RELATIONSHIP. IT DIDN'T WORK OUT. DID THEY HAVE TO GO THROUGH A HORRENDOUS DIVORCE LIKE ME? NO, THEY WERE SENSIBLE. THEY PARTED AS FRIENDS. IF I NEVER SEE HIM AGAIN, IT WILL BE A DAY TOO SOON. HOW ABOUT A WEEK FROM SATURDAY, FRANKIE? IT'S BAD ENOUGH YOU ASKED THAT CREEP TO THE WEDDING, BUT, MOTHER, ASKING STEVE TO GIVE IVY AWAY! I CERTAINLY DID NOT INVITE HIM! HE CALLED IVY, DIDN'T HE, IVY? YOU ASKED HIM. NO, I DIDN'T! IT WAS HIS IDEA. WELL, HE SAID YOU WOULDN'T MIND, FRANKIE. OH, I DON'T MIND. I JUST WON'T COME. NO PROBLEM! WE'LL CALL OFF THE WEDDING! I'M HAPPY TO LOSE MY DEPOSIT! I'M GETTING MARRIED, MOTHER! SO, YOU'RE REALLY NO GONNA COME, FRANKIE? OF COURSE I'LL BE THERE. I'M A BIG GIRL. I'LL COME. IT'S NO BIG DEAL. OH, YOU'RE AMAZING, FRANKIE. I KNEW YOU'D UNDERSTAND. Mother: BYE, IVY! Woman: OH, HO HO! BULLSHIT, DONNY! STOP SEEING THAT NO-GOOD SLUT!

IT WAS TERRIBLE! WAIT! WHERE IS HE? [SOBBING] AAH! [BARKS] Frankie: TRISH! HE WAS SO GIVING, SO COMPASSIONATE. HE HAD SUCH A WONDERFUL UNDERSTANDING OF A WOMAN'S HEAR AND NOW HE'S DEAD! TRISH, TRISH, CALM DOWN! NOW, WHAT HAPPENED? I COULDN'T HELP IT. IT WAS THE WAY HE LOOKED AT ME. HE WAS SO BEAUTIFUL, AND ALL OF A SUDDEN WE WERE IN EACH OTHER'S ARMS, AND WE WERE MAKING LOVE, AND IT WAS SO-- WAIT A MINUTE! YOU WERE MAKING WHAT?! WE WERE MAKING LOVE, AND IT WAS THE MOST BEAUTIFUL THING I HAVE EVER FEL IN MY ENTIRE LIFE! WAIT! WAIT! WAIT A MINUTE! WAIT A MINUTE! HE COULD DO THAT? WITH YOU? WHY SHOULDN'T HE DO THAT WITH ME?

WHAT ARE YOU SO HAPPY ABOUT? IT'S SO BEAUTIFUL OUT HERE, FRANKIE. YOU KNOW, I'M REALLY ENJOYING OUR DATE. LET'S GET ONE THING STRAIGHT, ULYSSES. THIS IS NO A DATE, OK? IS THAT BECAUSE YOU'RE UPTIGHT? NO, I AM NOT UPTIGHT! AND WHO TAUGHT YOU THAT STUPID WORD? TRISH. THAT FIGURES. LOOK, ULYSSES, I'M JUST A LITTLE UPSET RIGHT NOW, OK? IT'S 3:00 IN THE MORNING, I'M TIRED, I HAVEN'T CHANGED CLOTHES FOR TWO DAYS, AND YOU'VE PROBABLY JUST COST ME MY JOB. I'M SORRY, FRANKIE. [CHUCKLES] I MEAN, WHAT A JOKE! ME, TRYING TO TURN YOU INTO SOMEBODY THAT EVERYBODY IN AMERICA'S SUPPOSED TO FALL IN LOVE WITH. FRANKIE? WHY DO PEOPLE WAN TO FALL IN LOVE? I DON'T KNOW, ULYSSES. YOU'RE ASKING THE WRONG GIRL. DON'T YOU WAN TO FALL IN LOVE? YEAH, SURE. WHY NOT? BUT, BELIEVE ME, IT'S NOT THAT EASY. YOU FALL IN LOVE WITH SOME GUY, BUT HE'S IN LOVE WITH SOMEBODY ELSE. OR YOU THINK YOU'RE IN LOVE, BUT YOU'RE NOT. OR HE THINKS HE'S IN LOVE, BUT HE'S NOT. OR HE WAS IN LOVE, BUT NOW HE'S NOT, BUT NOW YOU ARE. YOU MAKE IT SOUND SO COMPLICATED. IT IS COMPLICATED. AND, ULYSSES, YOU SHOULD BE GLAD THAT YOU'RE NOT HUMAN AND YOU DON' HAVE TO SUFFER THROUGH THAT KIND OF HUMILIATION. IF I WERE HUMAN, FRANKIE, IT WOULD BE SIMPLE. I WOULD BE IN LOVE WITH YOU. YOU KNOW, FRANKIE, I THOUGHT LAST NIGH WAS A LOT OF FUN, BUT I THINK TONIGH WAS EVEN BETTER. I'M GLAD YOU HAD FUN. I CERTAINLY DID. GOOD. NOW I WANT YOU TO GO IN THERE AND CHANGE BACK INTO YOUR JUMPSUIT, AND PLEASE, ULYSSES, DON'T SAY A WORD ABOUT THIS EVENING TO ANYONE, OK? OK. OK, GOOD. GOOD NIGHT. CAN I KEEP MY TUXEDO? OK. FOR NOW. DOES THAT MEAN I CAN GO TO A WEDDING? I'M SORRY, ULYSSES. JUST GO CHANGE, OK? GOOD NIGHT. [BEEPING] Ulysses: JEFF? WHAT? LET'S SAY THERE'S THIS CERTAIN PERSON THAT YOU REALLY LIKE, BUT THEN YOU HAVE SEX WITH SOMEONE ELSE. NOW... A: DO YOU HAVE TO LIKE THE PERSON YOU HAVE SEX WITH? B: DO YOU HAVE TO HAVE SEX WITH THE PERSON YOU LIKE? C: DO YOU HAVE TO STOP LIKING THE PERSON YOU LIKE? "D"-- D... NONE OF THE ABOVE. I'M GOING TO HAVE TO CHANGE YOUR PROGRAM. BUT, JEFF, WHAT ABOUT BABIES? CAN I HAVE ONE? IT IS THAT WOMAN, ISN'T IT? WHAT HAS SHE BEEN TEACHING YOU?! SHE'S TEACHING ME ABOUT LIFE, JEFF, AND IT'S VERY INTERESTING, BUT WHAT I REALLY NEED TO KNOW IS, ARE LOVE AND SEX THE SAME THING? LOOK, ULYSSES, I WANT YOU TO REMEMBER THAT YOU ARE MUCH MORE ADVANCED THAN THAT WOMAN WILL EVER BE. DO NOT LET HER DRAG YOU DOWN TO HER LEVEL! SHE LIVES IN AN EMOTIONAL SWAMP! BUT THEN, SO DO MOST PEOPLE! SOME MINOR ACTIVITY OCCURS IN THE MEDULLA, AND--AND WHAM! THEY THINK THEY'RE IN LOVE. THE NEXT THING THEY KNOW, THEY HAVE 2 CHILDREN AND A CANINE. AND THEN, BOOM! SOME NEURON MISFIRES, AND THEY'RE DIVORCED, MISERABLE, AND ONLY GET TO SEE THEIR CHILDREN ON SUNDAYS. IT IS ALL CHEMICAL, ULYSSES, AND IT IS ALL A WASTE OF TIME. YOU WERE MADE FOR GRANDER THINGS, PAL. DO YOU READ ME? LOUD AND CLEAR, JEFF. GOOD, ULYSSES. GOOD. JEFF? DO YOU THINK MISS STONE HAS SEX APPEAL? I DO. BUT STEVE'S MOTHER SAID STEVE SAID YOU HAD A DATE FOR THE WEDDING, DEAR. Frankie: I DON'T KNOW WHAT STEVE'S TALKING ABOUT. WELL, ACCORDING TO STEVE'S MOTHER, HE'S NOT MUCH TO LOOK AT, BUT... I HEARD HE WAS SOME SORT OF DOCTOR. WE'RE ALL DYING TO MEET HIM. MOM, LOOK, I TOLD YOU I'M COMING ALONE! NOW, DARLING, YOU ARE GONNA BE ABLE TO DIG UP SOMEBODY, AREN'T YOU? NOW, YOU DON'T WANT STEVE TO SEE YOU THERE ALL ALONE, DO YOU, DEAR? MOM, THANKS FOR THE ADVICE. I'VE GOTTA GO. LOOK, I'LL CALL YOU WHEN I GET HOME, OK? BYE. OHH! DR. PETERS? HI. HOW DID WORK GO TODAY? FINE. JUST... GREAT. OH, GOOD. AHEM. JEFF, UM... I--I DON'T WAN TO SCARE YOU, UNDERSTAND THAT, OK? BUT COULD I ASK YOU SOMETHING? OK. UM... WELL, FOR, UH, REASONS I CAN'T GO INTO AND YOU DON' WANNA KNOW ABOUT, I HAVE TO GO TO THIS...WEDDING, AND I NEED A DATE, AND YOU'D BE THE EXACT PERFECT GUY. NOW, THIS ISN' A PROPOSITION. I JUST WANNA KNOW IF YOU MIGHT THINK ABOUT... MAYBE GOING WITH ME? A WEDDING? UM, I DON'T KNOW. I'M NOT VERY GOOD WITH PEOPLE. OH, THEY'RE NOT PEOPLE! THEY'RE JUST MY FAMILY. YOU KNOW, JEFF, YOU'VE GO REALLY NICE EYES. HAVE YOU EVER CONSIDERED MAYBE WEARING CONTACTS? GOOD NIGHT. Frankie: YOU CAN PICK ME UP AT 4:00 AT 1313 SOUTHEAST 10th STREET, MIAMI BEACH. OK?

DO YOU THINK THA I HAVE ANY PRIDE LEFT? OH! MMM! OH. OH, I LOVE YOU... AND I HATE YOU! [MELODRAMATIC MUSIC] I LOVE YOU, AND I HATE YOU, TOO. OH! NEW JERSEY. IT'S NOT JUST A STATE. IT'S A STATE OF MIND. HUH... IF WE EVER GET BACK TOGETHER, I'M GOING TO HOLD THIS AGAINST HIM FOREVER. LOOK, TRISH, DON'T USE THAT VCR, OK? I TOLD YOU, I'M SENDING ALL OF THIS STUFF BACK TOMORROW. OH, GOD! I DON'T SEE WHY ULYSSES BOUGHT YOU ALL THIS STUFF ANYONE. I'M THE ONE WHO SLEP WITH HIM, FOR CHRIST'S SAKE. IT'S BAD ENOUGH TO BE DUMPED BY DONALD BUT TO BE JILTED BY AN ANDROID! ULYSSES JUST THINKS I'M MAD AT HIM, AND THIS IS HIS WAY OF APOLOGIZING. HMM. BUT STILL... WHY 12 PAIRS OF THE SAME SHOE? BECAUSE HE DIDN'T KNOW YOUR SHOE SIZE. HE'S SO SWEET. MIND IF I BORROW THE SIZE 8? HEY, FRANKIE, HOW DO YOU THINK HE MANAGES TO BUY ALL THIS STUFF? [KNOCK KNOCK] HEY, IT LOOKS LIKE PROM NIGHT OUT HERE. COME ON IN. YOU'RE LOOKING SPIFFY. HEY, TRISH!

STEVE, I'D LIKE YOU TO MEE TWO SUPERFABULOUS PEOPLE, ESSIE AND RAMON HERNANDEZ. COMO ESTA? ESSIE AND RAMON ARE REAL INTERESTED IN NICARAGUA AND ALL THE ISSUES AND THINGS. AND I KNOW THEY'D LIKE TO HEAR ABOUT OUR SPECIAL BINGO FUND-RAISER. UNO MOMENTO. BACK IN A JIFFY. WHY DON'T YOU TAKE SOME TIME OFF, SUZY? WE'RE AT A WEDDING! I'M DOING I FOR YOU, HONEY.

[BEEP BEEP BEEP] ALTHOUGH SOME OF THE STORIES ARE SLIGHTLY EXAGGERATED, THERE'S NO DOUB THAT ULYSSES' POPULARITY IS SPREADING ACROSS THE COUNTRY FROM MIAMI TO SEATTLE. WE'LL TAKE A CLOSER LOOK AT SOME OF THE REASONS WHY. COMING UP AT 11:00 AFTER NEW JERSEY. STAY TUNED. TRISH, WHAT'S WRONG WITH ME? LOOK, YOU'RE HAVING A NERVOUS BREAKDOWN. I HAVE THOSE ALL THE TIME. JUST BECAUSE EVERYTHING OF VALUE IN YOUR LIFE HAS BEEN DESTROYED, SO WHAT? THERE'S STILL FOOD. NEW JERSEY CONTINUES. OH, WHY ARE YOU WATCHING THIS IDIOTIC SHOW?

DON'T WORRY, NOBODY EVER DIES ON THESE SHOWS. [PANTING] HE'S DEAD! UNLESS THEY'RE CANCELING HIS CONTRACT. OHH! DEADER THAN A DOOR NAIL. OH, NO! IT'S GO TO BE A MISTAKE! HE'S SUPPOSED TO BE A REGULAR! 10 YEARS AS A STARVING ACTOR. THEY CAN'T KILL HIM AFTER 12 EPISODES! IT'S NOT FAIR! TRISH, IT'S NO YOUR PROBLEM ANYMORE. HE MUST BE DEVASTATED. WHY DIDN'T HE CALL ME?

LOOK, I DON'T EVEN LIKE HIM THAT MUCH, BUT IT'S BETTER THAN NOTHING. I'LL JUST GO CALL FROM THE OTHER ROOM. COME ON, SNOWBALL. [RUFF RUFF] ULYSSES, YOU'RE NO CONCENTRATING. WHAT'S WRONG? I DON'T KNOW. I KEEP THINKING ABOUT FRANKIE. I MISS HER, JEFF. I THINK I'M IN LOVE. NO, YOU'RE NOT. YOU WERE NEVER PROGRAMMED TO BE IN LOVE, THEREFORE, YOU CAN'T BE IN LOVE. ULYSSES, I WON' ALLOW YOU TO SCREW UP 10 YEARS OF RESEARCH AND HARD WORK BECAUSE YOU'RE MOONING OVER SOME FEMALE. I'M JUST NOT THAT INTERESTED IN SPACE ANYMORE, JEFF. DON'T SAY THAT! PLEASE! THIS HAS BEEN A DREAM OF MINE EVER SINCE I WAS A LITTLE BOY, AND YOU'RE GOING TO MAKE IT COME TRUE FOR ME. ULYSSES, YOU HAVE A GREAT FUTURE IN SPACE. YOU'LL GO DOWN IN THE HISTORY BOOKS. YOU'RE TO BE ENVIED. I DON'T WANT TO BE ENVIED. I WANT TO BE LOVED. JEFF, I LOVE FRANKIE. SHE IS A PERSON, AND YOU ARE AN ANDROID! WHAT HAPPENED BETWEEN YOU WAS RIDICULOUS! RIDICULOUS, AND SHE KNOWS IT. SHE THOUGHT I WAS RIDICULOUS? YES, ULYSSES. I PROMISE YOU ONCE YOU'RE UP THERE YOU'LL FEEL COMPLETELY DIFFERENT, BECAUSE WHAT YOU'LL BE DOING IS TRULY THE MOST EXCITING THING IN THE WORLD. [CLICK] Deejay: 97 GTR. GOOD MORNING, SOUTH FLORIDA! WHAT DO YOU SAY, GUYS? YOU'RE ON YOUR WAY WITH THE BEARMAN THIS MORNING. IT IS 7:20. IT IS GOING TO BE SUNNY AND WARM AGAIN TODAY IN SOUTH FLORIDA. GREAT DAY TO GO OUT TO THE BEACHES AND WORK ON YOUR TAN. LET'S TALK A LITTLE BI ABOUT ULYSSES. WE'VE HEARD ABOUT HIM A LOT LATELY. WHAT DO YOU THINK OF ULYSSES? WHY DON'T YOU CALL ME NOW? ALL THE LINES ARE OPEN IN DADE, BROWARD AND THE PALM BEACHES, BUT FIRST, COMING UP, A SONG ULYSSES MIGHT LIKE, PINK FLOYD'S WELCOME TO THE MACHINE. 97 GTR. THE BEST ROCK 'N' ROLL VARIETY. [HONKING] [WHISTLE] MY GOSH! SNAZZY CAR! SURE IS A WELCOME RELIEF FROM THAT OLD WRECK OF YOURS. HI, STEVE. OW! YOU KNOW, I'M REALLY GLAD YOU CALLED. IT WAS, UM... A NICE SURPRISE. YOU KNOW HOW MUCH I WANTED TO GO TO THIS PRESS CONFERENCE AND YOU LET ME TAG ALONG AND I REALLY APPRECIATE THAT. WELL, AS A FRIEND OF MINE SAID, "ANY WOMAN IN MIAMI WOULD GIVE UP A MONTH OF GOOD SEX JUST TO SEE THIS BLASTOFF." BUT I KNOW ONE GAL WHO WON'T HAVE TO. FRANKIE, HOW'S MY-- HOW'S MY HAIR LOOK? UM... IS IT OK? IT'S FINE. SURE? STEVE. OH, ALAN, GOOD TO SEE YOU. I HEARD ABOUT YOUR HAND. THE ONLY THING AFFECTED IS MY GOLF GAME. STEVE, CAN YOU EXCUSE ME FOR A MINUTE? ALL RIGHT. YEAH. YOU REMEMBER GUY, DON'T YOU? GUY, GOOD TO SEE YOU. JEFF. YOU DON'T HAVE ANY BUSINESS BEING HERE. LOOK, JEFF, I'M REALLY SORRY ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED. BUT I'M GLAD HE'S FIXED AND EVERYTHING'S OK. WHO SAID HE WAS OK? THE PAPERS, THE TELEVISION. WELL, HE ISN'T. HE DOESN'T WORK THE WAY HE WAS PROGRAMMED TO. WHAT DO YOU MEAN? YOU DON'T EVEN REALIZE THE DAMAGE YOU'VE DONE, DO YOU? I HAVE SPENT YEARS DEVELOPING ULYSSES SO HE COULD FUNCTION IN SPACE ALONE. AND NOW, IN LESS THAN ONE MONTH'S TIME, YOU HAVE RUINED HIM. TELL ME THIS-- HOW'S HE SUPPOSED TO SURVIVE OUT THERE NOW WHEN ALL HE THINKS ABOUT IS YOU? READY, HON? WE ARE PLEASED YOU COULD ALL BE HERE TODAY TO MEET THE ULYSSES ANDROID. THE AWESOME DISTANCES INVOLVED IN THE EXPLORATION OF DEEP SPACE HAVE ALWAYS POSED A SERIOUS DILEMMA. HOW COULD A MAN WITHSTAND THE TERRIBLE ISOLATION AND CONFINEMENT? HOW COULD A MACHINE BE OUR EYES AND EARS? WE BELIEVE THE ULYSSES ANDROID... IS THE ANSWER. [APPLAUSE] AND NOW, LET ME INTRODUCE ULYSSES HIMSELF. HELLO, I AM THE ULYSSES ANDROID DEVELOPED BY DR. JEFF PETERS AT CHEMTEC, AND I AM HERE TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. [ALL SPEAKING AT ONCE] WE'RE CURIOUS TO KNOW WHAT YOUR FEELINGS ARE CONCERNING YOUR IMMINEN DEPARTURE INTO SPACE. I'M AN ANDROID. I DON'T HAVE FEELINGS. BUT IT LOOKS LIKE YOUR PROGRAM CONTAINS A LO OF HUMAN TENDENCIES. THESE MINOR TECHNICAL ERRORS HAVE BEEN CORRECTED. THE QUESTION EVERYONE'S DYING TO ASK IS, ARE YOU STILL LOVESICK? NO. NEXT QUESTION. AREN'T YOU FRIGHTENED GOING UP THERE ALONE FOR SEVEN YEARS? NO. THAT'S EASY. IT'S PEOPLE WHO ARE FRIGHTENING. THEY WALK AROUND HUR AND CONFUSED AND MORE ALONE THEN I WILL EVER BE IN SPACE. PEOPLE CAN BUILD AN INCREDIBLY SOPHISTICATED SPACE PROGRAM, AND YET THEY CAN'T SOLVE THEIR MOST BASIC PROBLEM-- HOW TO LOVE AND CARE FOR THOSE WHO LOVE THEM. SOMEDAY WHEN PEOPLE HAVE FIGURED THAT OUT, THEY MIGHT BE MORE THAN JUST MACHINES. [APPLAUSE] JESUS CHRIST! THIS GUY COULD RUN FOR PRESIDENT. WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE? I JUST WANTED TO TELL ULYSSES GOOD-BYE. I DON'T THINK THAT'S VERY APPROPRIATE. DO YOU? NO. PROBABLY NOT. Man: MINUS 10... 9, 8, 7, MAIN ENGINE START, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0...LIFTOFF! THIS EVENING MARKED THE DAWN OF A NEW ERA IN SPACE TRAVEL. AT 6:42 P.M. EASTERN DAYLIGHT TIME, THE ULYSSES ANDROID WAS SUCCESSFULLY LAUNCHED ON ITS SEVEN-YEAR MISSION INTO DEEP SPACE. IT WAS A NEAR-PERFECT LIFTOFF VIEWED BY AN ENTHUSIASTIC CROWD OF OVER 10,000, MANY OF WHOM CARRIED SIGNS AND BANNERS WITH THEIR BEST WISHES FOR THE CHARISMATIC ULYSSES, WHO SO RECENTLY HAS CAPTURED THE HEAR AND IMAGINATION OF THIS NATION. CONGRESSMAN MARCUS, WHO EARLIER THIS WEEK MADE HEADLINES WITH THE ANDROID, WAS AMONG THE DIGNITARIES AT THE PRESS CONFERENCE YESTERDAY TO BID ULYSSES A FAREWELL AND BON VOYAGE. THE LAUNCH FROM PAD NUMBER 19... [DOORBELL RINGS] WAS BROADCAST LIVE VIA SATELLITE TO OVER 60 COUNTRIES THROUGHOUT THE WORLD. WE TAKE YOU NOW FOR A SUMMARY OF TODAY'S LAUNCH TO FLIGHT DIRECTOR CHARLES KRAFTMAN AT MISSION CONTROL. WE WILL BE SPEAKING DIRECTLY WITH ULYSSES IN THE CAPSULE. DR. PETERS, WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE? OH, GOD, I MISS HIM SO MUCH. [SOBBING] WHAT... JEFF, WHAT ARE YOU DOING? I LOVE YOU. ULYSSES? MMHMM. I LOVE YOU, TOO. [BLEEP BLEEP BLEEP] OH, NO! NO! I'M SORRY, FRANKIE. I ALWAYS SEEM TO FALL APAR AT THE WRONG TIME. THAT'S OK, ULYSSES. NOBODY'S PERFECT. THAT'S GOOD NEWS, HANK. [BEEP] Man: ULYSSES, HOW IS THE MISSION GOING SO FAR? [BEEP] IT TRULY IS THE MOST EXCITING THING IN THE WORLD. [BEEP] IS IT DIFFICULT FUNCTIONING OUT THERE ALL ALONE? [BEEP] [BEEP] NO. YOU SEE, I'M NOT VERY GOOD WITH PEOPLE.
