I'm really glad you guys got to see the new clinic. Are you kidding? Think we'd come to Boston and not see our girl? We're so proud ofyou. -Hey, Phil, I need your help on my cadaver. -Okay. I've been trying for, like, six hours to find the posterior thoracic nerve, and if I don't dig it up soon, Lenhoff is gonna cut me open. Yeah, I know. Posterior thoracic is a bitch. I need... Janet! Janet, love, we need you. Come here. Why don't I like the sound of that? It's all in the interest of science, dear. -Trust me? -Sure. Put your left hand up. Tom, pay attention. You just dig behind... Sorry my hands are cold. Dig behind the scalenus medius, then you move aside the brachial plexus, and then slide down to the serratus anterior. And there you have it. Posterior thoracic. You finished, Philip? Yes. I thank you. Science thanks you. Tom here thanks you. I thank you. All right, you guys. I gotta go study, okay? -Sure. -Bye. Any thoughts on why we're seeing shortness of breath, Iethargy and dizziness in a 7-year-old? Eisenmenger Syndrome. I mean, that would go with the pulmonary hypertension. That's a bit of a leap, Mr. Markoff. But assuming your hypothesis is correct, then why are we seeing the low heart rate, the diminished reflex and a lack of affect? Perhaps the fact that a 7-year-old boy is alone and his parents wouldn't bother to be with him when he's in the hospital. Personalizing, Philip? No, sir. Here you are, baby. I had to go all the way to the CVS on Commonwealth to get you the cherry kind. It'll be right here waiting for you when you wake up. There's a lesson for you all. Things are not always what they appear to be, and even the remarkable Mr. Markoff isn't perfect. All right, guys. Next patient. I only torture you, because when every major hospital comes clamoring for you to do your residency with them, I want you to realize that this place recognizes your talent and is gonna push you to be even better. Also, l... Well, I kind of like torturing you. Sorry. Don't turn around. What part of "don't turn" -didn't you understand? -Sorry. He is locked in. I think he's looking at you. No. He is definitely looking at you. -I don't think so. -Damn. He could not get cuter if he was holding a teddy bear and a puppy. -Mr. Markoff? -Yes? I need your genius. He likes you. Butene... Aromatic? Cyclooctene... Antiaromatic. Aromatics are tough. Yeah. I can never figure out which electrons to put where. You wanna know a trick? Don't memorize, diagram. I'm Philip, by the way. Markoff. We actually met the other day for a second. Well, we didn't really meet. We just kind of bumped. Yeah. I'm Megan McAllister. So, that's cool. You're helping out at the clinic. Yeah. And you're going to med school. That I am. That's cool, too. Yeah, I should really be going, 'cause I have to study. I have this huge test in 17 hours. Wait. You've got a test tomorrow, and you are studying? Yeah. That's what people do. No, not me. Okay, so what do you think I should be doing? I think you should be cutting loose, airing out your brain. Right. Right. So, when I fail the test tomorrow, can I write that theory in at the essay portion of my medical school applications? Where you applying? Here, he asks hopefully? Probably, but I probably won't get in. They really would be lucky to have you. -You don't even know me. -Oh, my God. That's true. Wow. Okay. Then come on. I'll quiz you on the way. -On the way where? -729. I got your page number. On the way to the place I always go the night before an exam. You know what? I really have to study, and I'm not that, you know, "run away with a guy I've only known for 30 seconds" type of girl, so... Okay. Okay. SUNY, Albany, summa cum laude. B.U. med school, second year, top 5% of my class. Not bragging. I love animals. I don't like birds, though. I am an unapologetic member ofthe Young Republicans, but I also don't really like to talk politics. Sometimes I work too hard. And when I was little, I really hated wearing full-length pants. Strange, I know. And in case you haven't noticed, I really like you. So, I'll pick you up at 8:00? I have to change. Don't do that. Never do that. I like you just the way you are. I meant my clothes. Right. Clothes. All right. I'll pick you up at 7:30, then. -Okay. -All right. -Okay. -So the trick to roulette, or at least my theory is you gotta feel the numbers. You've gotta really, really kind of get in sync with the wheel. Are you hearing yourself right now? Yeah, it works. Watch. Here. I'll show you. Final bets, please. Place your bets, place your bets. Is this you hearing or feeling the number? Okay, I got it. All right, black 22. -Well, it doesn't always work. -I don't think that theory works. Or maybe someone was distracting me. -So now it's my fault? -Yes, of course it was your fault. -Fine. Blame it on me. -You're a bad person. Your drinks, sir. Thank you. -Oh, my gosh. -That's a very pink drink. I have to be good. It's a school night. All right. Trust me, though. The rush is gonna be good for you, it releases the endorphins, gets your brain working. Cyclopropene. Aromatic? There you go. See? You know this stuff. You just got to trust yourself. Okay. -Okay. -Take these. -Close your eyes. -Okay. And really feel them. -Feeling them. -Right. -Last chance. Final bets. -I want that one. -Red seven. -Yes. -Oh, my God! -We got a winner here. That's insane. Look at that. -Oh, my God. -Wow. I know this is probably way too late, but you're not dating anyone, right? Well, I was dating Leonardo DiCaprio, then he moved to Hollywood and got all famous, so I dumped him. -Right. -Yeah. So, I think we're good. -What are you doing for lunch? -When? I don't know. The next 50, 60 years? -Well, I have to check my book, but... -Okay. -Hey, wait, wait, wait, wait. -What? Are you okay? Yeah, yeah, just wait. Hi. Welcome home. -All right. -Let's go inside. It's cold. You're still cold? Heat. -You cold? -Yeah. Give me your hands. My mom used to do this to keep my hands warm when I was little. This may be the cutest thing ever. Have you told your parents we've moved in together yet? -Philip, I'm... -Look, it's important to you, okay? So it's important to me. -I know. And I'm gonna tell them. I promise. -Okay. I just don't wanna deal with the "You're so young. You've only known him for six months. "Are you sure about this?" Blah, blah, blah. But I promise you, I'm gonna tell them. Okay. Hey, I have an idea. How about we stop unpacking, order Chinese food and study together? Well, that sounds nice. But I got a study group tonight I got to go to. Microanatomy. -Boo. -Right? And the worst part is, it's probably gonna go all night, so I wouldn't wait up for me either. But we can celebrate tomorrow. I'm a med school widow already. I knew this would happen. You're not. Stop. Well, can you at least drop these off for me? What, are those applications? Yep. I only have one more to go. All right, all right. Well, you're getting into B.U., so I wouldn't stress it. -I like you. -I like you, too. -Do you really have to go? -Yeah, I do. But I will kiss you right when I get home. -Okay? -Okay. I love you. I love you, too. Bye. Bye. I feel like a tourist. Just, you know, squint your eyes, and then pretend you're in Paris. Say what? -lt means I'm freezing my butt off. -Does it? Well, here. Put your hands in my pockets. What are you doing? How's that? Is that better? Much better. Thank you. You're welcome. I'm gonna start calling you Pocket. -How about that? -What's in here? Driver, will you stop the carriage for a second? What's going on? -You trust me? -Should l? Megan McAllister, I love you with all of my heart. Will you marry me? Philip, there's nothing I want more than to marry you, but... But what? I haven't even graduated yet, and you're still in med school and you haven't even met my parents. Well, let's go. Right now. Tonight. We can leave this second. We'll go to New Jersey. Driver, do you think this horse can make it to New Jersey? I think the horse is gonna get really tired and sick, but then we'll drive. They're gonna go crazy. Babe, I know this might sound a little old-fashioned, but I really want their blessing. I want them to be happy for us. I love you so much. I love you, too. Philip, it's just my parents. It's gonna be fine. They're gonna love you. -Megan. -Hey. -Hi. -Honey, hi, hi. Mom, Dad, this is Philip. Hello, Philip. It's a pleasure to meet you. I was told you liked roses, Mrs. McAllister. Myweakness. Thankyou. And please, call me Susan. Susan. And I was told your weakness was Pinot Grigio. I guess my secret is out. I haven't had this one. Thank you. So, let's go inside. Lunch should be ready any moment. -Yeah. -Come on in. Let's go. Wow, Philip, you really must rate. Mom doesn't bring out the silver for just anybody. Well, it just seems a shame to keep something so pretty... Philip? Philip. -Philip? -Yeah. Thank you, I'd love some. Looks so good. So, Mr. McAllister... -I'm sorry. David... -Better. I hear that you have an awesome short game. -You play? -Yeah. Mr. McAllister, you know why we came here today. Yes, I do, and I'm sure you can imagine some of the questions I have. Absolutely. I mean, "What's the rush?" Right? -Yeah. -"Aren't you too young?" "What about your studies?" And "How do I know I can trust you "with the person that I care about most in all the world?" Yeah, that about sums it up. Well, sir, with me, what you see is pretty much what you get. You know, I grew up near Syracuse, parents split when I was a kid. I'm not rich and no handouts. I had to work my way through school. Summa cum laude from SUNY, Albany. And I love your daughter very much. You sound like the American dream. Isn't that a good thing, sir? Mr. McAllister, I would like very much to spend the rest of my life making Megan happy. You know, there's no rush. You guys could live together for a bit, really get to know each other. We have been living together for a bit. Really? I mean, it just works great, you know? He's amazing, and he's at the top of his class, and he helps me and we study together. And it's crazy, but we're just great for each other. He'll still charge you. That's exactly right. By the hour. Megan, you managed to find a young man capable of crushing it 300 yards off the tee and keeping it in the middle ofthe fairway. -Okay. -Okay. -Bye, baby. -Love you guys. -Love you, too. -Nice meeting you guys. -Drive safely. -Okay. Yes! I told you. I told you, Pocket. It's gonna be happily ever after for you and me. -It's amazing. -We did it. We did it. -Okay, so, ask me again. -What? Come on, please ask me again. All right. Megan McAllister, I love you with all my heart. -Will you marry... -Yes! -Yes, yes. -Okay. That was fast. Well, I couldn't wait to meet you. Charmer. I like that. Nice. Great. -ls my tie okay? -Yeah. Some of this? Can you remind me what this is for again? -It's for the website. -We have a website? -It's going to be a pink website. -Yes. There we go. Smiling. What happened? You look like Ken and Barbie. -Did he say "Ken and Barbie"? -Yeah. -ls he making fun of us? -No, it's a good thing. Great. You're a beautiful couple. You're a beautiful couple. This is going to be the wedding website to end all wedding websites. Babe, this is looking so cute! Hey. Are you busy? No, I'm not busy at all. I'm just looking at genetic notes. But go ahead. Tell me about this website. Well, it's going to be where we're registered and everything, obviously. But then there's going to be pictures, and there's going to be a countdown. It's like a rocket launch. There's gonna be a quiz for all our friends to take to see how well they know us. Doesn't really matter how well other people know us. It's about how well we know each other, right? God, I like you. I like you, too. We should get married. And I'm so excited to finally meet your family. Babe, I wanted to talk to you about that, okay? I talked to them, and I don't know if they're going to be able to make it. What are you talking about? -It's our engagement party. -Yeah, I know. Philip, we're getting married. Don't you think it's strange that I haven't met your family? Well, we're a strange family. Look, we're all nice to you now, Philip, but ifyou mess with our little sister... Yeah, okay, I promise. I will be good. -You have nothing to worry about. -You better be. Hey, what are you doing with my fianc? Nothing. They're just scaring the ever living crap out of me. We like this guy. I told you. He's a good one. And look, I found my maid of honor. One of 19. Not to mention the three flower girls, the two ring bearers. -But you're my favorite. -Thank you. No, I know it's not all about just the one day. It's about spending the rest of my life... Sorry, can you guys excuse me for a second? Yeah. Now, which one of you boys wants to get me a drink? Philip. It's so good to see you. This house, it's so beautiful. -Philip... -Philip what? Hey, I didn't scare you off with all the wedding talk, did l? -No, no, no. -Okay, sorry. I'm Philip's mother. Oh, my gosh! It's so nice to finally meet you! My parents cannot wait to introduce you to everyone. Okay, don't move. I'll be right back. I'll be right back. She's very beautiful. I see your father's right at home. He's already good friends with the McAllisters? You're still keeping score, huh, Mom? You know, if it makes you feel any better, Dad's never met them before today either, okay? The happy family together again. Well, I'm not seeing your brother, so I'm guessing that he wasn't invited. Guess whatever you want. Hi. Come here. So i was thinking, for everyday, we could do the Kate Spade Sag Harbor dinner plates in the polka dots, and then the salad plates in stripes, because the stripes and the polka dots look really good together. Especially on the deck of our beautiful beach house -that we're gonna have one day. -Nice. And for when we invite the head of the hospital over, who neither one of us can stand, I was thinking we could do the Royal Doulton Etoile or the Spode lndian Tree. What do you think? Well, I think the guy that comes up with these names has way too much time on his hands, personally. And I got the countdown going. Look. I mean, I know it's cheesy, but it's cute, right? You know, gotta have it. And it's in pink. Jan. Janet, a friendly face. -That is exactly what I needed. -Hey, Phil. -You're in scrubs? You look cute. -No. Where were you today? You missed a whole bunch of stuff on the test. I missed a lot of stuff. But I don't care. Because I've got you, and you're gonna give me notes, 'cause you're a good friend. -Sorry, friend. -No, wait, wait, wait. Philip, you're drunk. -We're friends, right? -Sure, we're friends. But you're getting a little close. Philip, stop. What? Come on. No, knock it off! Don't you say no to me. -Yeah? Watch me. -Really? What's wrong with you? What would your fiance say about this if she found out about you? What did you say? You threatening me? -Rhinestones. -Okay. Wow. Does that come with a light switch? Let's look at some other dresses. Are these those disposable phones? The ones that can't be traced, they can't be tracked, anything like that? Yeah, no lD, no nothing. All right, thanks. It's a lot of dress. I like the way it moves. -Really? -Moves? It's like a tsunami. Oh, my God. I am never getting married. When you meet somebody that makes you feel like Philip makes me feel, and you will, you'll do anything to show him how much you love him, even wear a tsunami dress. Wow, okay. We've got cakes to taste. Go, get changed. Quickly, quickly. We have to go! Don't touch anything. We'll be back in an hour. -We are going to find a dress. -Yes, we are. -This is good. -That's yummy. -You like it? -Megs, you cannot go with this one. Why not? Because all ofyour guests will die of pleasure, and you will have that on your conscience. -I'm serious. This is so good. -Give me some. -Let me see. -It's perfect. It's so good. It's like raspberry something. You guys, look. My fianc misses me. -He's the best boyfriend. -Just a little bit more of that. Looks like a very interesting project. Yep. You can put my number in any of these phones, ifyou want. Hope it's not much longer. I know. Let's hope that she... Wow. Good "wow"? Staggering "wow." I just want you to love it. You are going to be the most beautiful bride ever. I'm getting married! Congratulations! It's great. This is the one for sure. I need to see some lD. -That's me, man. Brian Stevens. -Yeah. -Hey, Phil. -Hey, man. How you doing? Janet, can I talk to you for a sec? -Sure. -Cool. All right. So, listen, I just wanted to apologize for the other night, 'cause I was really drunk. No, I was out of line. -Forget about it. -It's not okay. But I just want to let you know, if you even think about messing with me and my fiance, I swear to God... You understand? -Okay? -Yeah. All right. Good? Okay. All right, guys, I'm out. Got to get to class. -Later, dude. -All right, see you. And that concludes the scintillating video portion of our presentation. You will see that offspring four is not sharing the same characteristic with offspring seven. Mr. Markoff, from which parent did offspring four receive chromosome 13? The father, obviously. That locus is linked to congenital blindness which doesn't appear in the maternal line. Nobody likes a smartass, Mr. Markoff. Thank you. All right, any questions? Yes, sir. Would the same hold true from what we talked... Philip, call me back, please. I just tried to take out some cash, and it says the account's overdrawn. Come on. Don't worry about it. I'll pay, my treat. Hey, baby, it's me. Can you call me back? Bye. I'm sure there's an explanation. You should call the bank or something. ATMs screw up all the time. I've called Philip three times in the past hour, and he hasn't called me back. He's probably in class. I'm telling you, it's just a bank screw-up. You guys are starting a life together, Megs. Ifyou're gonna marry him, you have to trust him. Okay? -Yes. -The strawberry and the grape. See? Drama queen. -Hello? -Baby? -Where have you been? -i'm at the Dean's office right now. Listen, Megan, I'm so sorry about the whole money thing. I got this NlH grant, and the check came late, but I'm getting it Monday morning, so i'll put the money back in the account first thing, okay? No, it's okay. I mean, yeah. No, no, no, no. I'm totally serious. We're supposed to be a team, you know, and I want us to be able to tell each other everything, okay? No secrets. Look, sweetheart, I gotta let you go, okay? But i wanted to call and let you know that i am very sorry. Your fianc is a big, dumb idiot, -and that it's all taken care of. -Thank you. -Okay. I love you so much. -i love you, too. Bye. To my best friend's wedding. Red Sox, huh? My favorite team. Come on in. Sweetie, you got some mail. -It's from B.U. -Hello, Dr. McAllister. It's really thin. "Dear Miss McAllister, thank you for this application. We..." No? Oh, man! But... You're way too cute to be shy. Is that what you're into? You want me to tie you up? No. You. But how am I gonna give you a massage if my hands are tied? I don't want a massage. Okay, well, I don't do bondage, so I guess we're in a bit of a standoff here, huh? All right. Get down on the floor. Hands behind your back. -You don't have to do any of this. -All the way down! -I'll give you whatever you want. -All the way down. Put your hands behind your back. All right. Give me your hands. Please, please, please! Look, I don't have a lot of money. I don't have a lot of money, okay? Please, I'll do whatever you want. Please, don't! Trisha Leffler from Las Vegas. I know where you live now. -This is an ATM card, right? -Yeah. -What's your PlN? -4-3-2-1. -What's your PlN? -It's 4-3-2-1. Please don't hurt me. -Oh, no! -Shut up. Shut up. Don't say a word. Do you understand? There you go. There you go. Before I leave, I'm gonna take a little souvenir, okay? Yeah. Thank you. Such a gentleman. So after, he cut offyour panties with a knife to keep as a souvenir? He took my phone and deleted the messages he left for me. May I see that phone, ma'am? How'd he get your number? He replied to my Craigslist ad, and I texted him back. So then, this entirely anonymous person, who could've been anybody, you decided to invite him up to your room? I'm usually a better judge. -What were you advertising, Miss Leffler? -Massages. So, if we check your record for any priors, we're not gonna turn up any solicitation, prostitution? Look, I'm not the criminal here, okay? He is. And I hope you nail his preppy ass. I'm telling you, what he did to me, he's done it before, and he liked it. Liked what? I don't know. Humiliating me. The one with the Red Sox cap, just like the lady said. Calm, attractive, non-threatening. A psycho who likes to rough up defenseless women. Couldn't ask for a better cover. Philip? Baby? Hey, I thought you weren't coming back till tomorrow. -I needed to see you. -Why, what happened? What happened, baby? I didn't get in. I knew it was a long shot, but I thought maybe if I was an undergrad... Listen, listen, they're idiots, okay? Yeah, but they accepted you. You see? That proves my point. -It's not funny. -I know. Listen, I'm gonna transfer wherever you go, okay? No, I don't want you to transfer. I worked really hard, you know? I really did. I know. And now I just ruined everything. No, baby, you did not ruin anything, okay? Look at me. You didn't ruin anything. B.U. was our plan. We were supposed to be together. And we will be. No matter what happens, we're gonna be fine. Can we just stay like this forever? We can stay like this for as long as you want. It's just you and me, Pocket. Nothing else matters. You really got to go away again? -Final fitting. -No. -Yes. -No final fitting. -I love you. -I love you, too. -Call me when you get there, okay? -Okay, I will. -Bye. -Bye. "Dear Miss McAllister, we regret to inform you that..." Well, I guess that decides it. On to plan B. Megan, you're in. St. Kitts. This is fantastic! It's such a great program. Look, baby. Mom, that's a million miles away. I can't move a million miles away from my husband. Well, if he loves you now, he's going to love you in five years after you graduate, right? Mom, I really don't want to disappoint you. Honey, you could never... Baby, you'll never disappoint me. It's just... It would be such a waste. You are so bright and so compassionate. You would make an amazing doctor. I've thought about this a lot. Ifwe can't go to medical school together, then I'll just wait. I can always reapply later if I want to. But for now, this is what I want. -Hello? -Hey, guess where i am? I'm so glad I got you. So, listen, I was thinking, what about a beach wedding? We'd have a beautiful sunset ceremony. I was just sleeping. Can I call you later? You were? It's the middle of the afternoon. i know. i've been working hard. Okay, yeah, I'll call you later. I love you. -Okay. -Bye. So, what's up? What did he say? Did he like your idea? Yeah, he loved it. He was just studying. But he liked it. It's gonna be amazing. -Hold on one second, okay, Mom? -Okay. -I gotta go. -Why? What's wrong? You okay? -I'm fine. -Then why do you have to go? I'm going to see a guy I met on the train. What guy? is he cute? What's he do? -He's a student. -in? I don't know what in. You gotta know something about him, honey. -Where's he from? -I promise I will get you the whole 411. -Okay, have fun. i love you, Julissa. -I love you, too. -Are you Brian? -Yeah. You're beautiful. You're not so bad yourself. -Ready? -Yeah. What do you do here in Boston, Brian? I'm a grad student. -ln what? -Sciences. Wow, that is so cool! I'm actually doing grad work myself right now in New York. Drug and alcohol counseling. I figure, nobody knows the territory like somebody who's been there themselves, right? Get down on the ground. Put your hands behind your back right now. Just get on the... Julissa Brisman, New York City. Massage table, no forcible entry. Sound familiar? One difference. CSl said there was skin under the fingernails. She fought back, so he shot her. -He's stepping it up. -Yeah. -Mr. Markoff? -What... -I scared you. -Dr. Janeway. I'm sorry, sir. I'm a little jumpy, I guess. I've been staying awake two nights in a row memorizing genetic sequences. Trying to impress me. Always, sir. -How's your fiance? -Good, great. I mean, we've both got school. And then there's the wedding. So, it's a lot. -I bet. -Well, I'd better get going. But have a good evening. -You, too, Philip, and try to get some rest. -Okay. Yeah, I will. -Hey. -Hey. I'm sorry. -You didn't give me a kiss when you got in. -I know, I didn't want to wake you... Oh, my God. What happened to your neck? A woman went psychotic in the ER tonight. It was crazy. She went nuts. She hurt a nurse, so I had to step in and do something. My hero. Wash up and come to bed. We may have just caught a break. A friend of Julissa's just called, got me into her phone. We have the text she got from the last guy she had an appointment with. Now, if digital forensics can get an lP off that, we can get an address, maybe even a name. -That'll take, what, a couple of days? -At least. How'd he meet her? Another ad on Craigslist? Looks like that. I don't get it. This day and age, girl's in a friggin' hotel room, a guy she doesn't even know... I just... Mrs. Flores, Detective Bennett. Sorry for the loss ofyour daughter. She was a good girl. I'm sure she was. She was just getting her life together. Who would do this? Who would do this to my baby? Used to be able to see who the bad guys were, right? Now it's all texts and emails and websites. The creeps are hiding in our houses, and we don't even know who they are. it is 7:.07 and once again, here's Matt. All right, Meredith, thank you. And now to a story out of Boston that's gonna terrify anyone who's ever placed a classified ad, especially online. Wow, this is in Boston. -What's that? -A man is apparently targeting women -who place ads on the popular website -This guy's right here in Boston. Craigslist. Police say he's already killed one woman and attacked another in Boston. -Hello? -Hey, Megan, it's Mom. Listen, I was watching the news, and I saw this story about this Boston hotel killer. No, we're not staying in a hotel. We're here, home, studying. Me and Philip are safe. Okay. -I love you. -i love you, too. Bye. Of course, the profile is never exact, but a pretty clear picture is emerging of what we're looking for. We're talking about a guy with an inability to form close emotional relationships with women. Probably sexual issues. A loner. A guy who shies away from the crowd. Maybe later. Come on. -What's up? -Let's go. You didn't even give me a chance. A man with no sense of status, accomplishment. Let me get this straight. We're looking for a big, blond loser wearing a Red Sox cap in Boston? Is that what you're telling me? Let's get right on that one. We should have that settled by morning. Thanks for the crack work, Detective. Maybe somebody will lD the photo. We got a blurry photo with the same damn guy wearing the same friggin' hat. This is just going great. Police are now hoping someone out there recognizes this man from all the surveillance photos in the various hotels. They are trying to get onto his track this morning, but so far, they have no leads. But police say the warning is out to women now that this man is still on the loose, especially if you post ads on Craigslist. Matt. -Who is it? -Marcelo, superintendent. I need to talk to you. Oh, my God. That's amazing. Nice. All right, that's it for me. I'm cashing out. I'm done. I'm sorry, I gotta go. I've got another date, ladies. I'm so sorry. $5,300. You have three new messages. Hey, Philip. i need to talk to you. Where are you? Philip, call me. i need to talk to you, okay? Message deleted. -Baby, where are you? Call me as soon as... -No, no. Message deleted. Hey, your client there yet? He called and said he'd be, like, 10 minutes. All right, well, text me when he gets there. Promise. Love you, sweetheart. I love you, too, babe. You're a young one. Come on in. It's just a lap dance like the ad said, okay? That's all I came for, yeah. Lie face-down on the floor. Lie face-down on the floor right now! Put your hands behind your back. Listen to me. I do not want to kill you, okay? -Who's calling your phone? -I don't know. Honey, take a seat. Don't move, don't move. Get off! Get off! What the hell's going on here? ...just call the toll-free number on your screen for a free personal enrollment kit. You're under no obligation to enroll, and no salesman will call. it's so easy to afford peace of mind. The hunt for the man being called "The Craigslist Killer" has spread this morning from Boston to Rhode island. Police in Warwick near Providence are investigating a robbery attempt that may involve the same man who killed two young women in Boston. Boston police say the murderer apparently targeted... I thought you said, "No secrets." What are you talking about? Where have you been? -What do you mean? -The super came by. You haven't paid the rent in three months. If there's something going on, then I need to know before... Before what? Before you marry me? I missed some bills, Meg. I'm sorry, okay? I'm studying 20 hours a day. I've got millions of tons of crap that I'm dealing with and professors on top of that. But you know what? You're right, you're right. I screwed up. I screwed up, and I'm... You know what? I'm sorry that I'm not the perfect guy you thought I was. -I never asked you to be the perfect guy. -Then what are you asking me? What do you want from me, Meg? I should've told you first, okay? And I didn't. I just... I get in my own head about things, and... It's been a really hard time for me, you know? It's been a hard time for me, too. I know, I know. Look, I am... I'm sorry, babe. I am so sorry, okay? I haven't been there for you, and I'm gonna be, all right? Baby, look at me. It's my fault, okay? But I am trying my best. I'll go down to the management office tomorrow. I'll take care of it right away, first thing. I promise, okay? God, I love you. I don't want to mess this up, babe. I don't want to lose you. I'm not going anywhere. -You promise? -Yes. Good. Just, you need to let me in, okay? I have no idea what I did to deserve you. Lady got lucky. Husband was in the lobby, came to check on her. Hey, blow that up for me, would you? Lieutenant? We tracked an lP address for that last email to Julissa. Whoever sent it lives in Quincy. He who kills by the lnternet fries by the lnternet, right? He's not frying yet. It's an apartment complex, so the killer could've been using somebody else's wireless signal. All right, then I want a full tenant list for that building. I want six units down there, six invisible units. And I want 100 copies ofthis picture blown up, all right? Let's hope the coffee's good down in Quincy. No, no, no, no, no. Listen to me, listen to me. I don't want you hanging out in the mall on a school night, all right? You understand? Okay, all right. You got a ride? Do I know him? Okay. All right. Great, I love you, baby. I'll see you back at the house. This guy is driving me crazy. I mean, he's turning me into my old man here. I'm two seconds away from locking my daughter up for good. Gotta let her go at some point. Do l? There's got to be 800 units in this place. Great. All we've got to do now is wait for a guy to waltz by who looks like a vicious, loner killer with emotional issues. You're kidding me, right? This guy could be anybody. You got another picture I can look at? Anything? Well, ifyou see anyone, just give me a call. -Hey. Before we go... -What? What? What are we having for dinner tonight? Making something good? I don't know yet. -You don't have to cook tonight. -No, I want to. Okay. Laundry time first, though. IP came up with a name. Son of a bitch! "Philip Markoff, residing in Quincy, Mass." Are you kidding me? I mean, come on, you put a baseball cap on that freak, we've definitely got our guy. He's a med student at B.U. Four hundred and seventy-eight friends. Who the hell would want 478 friends? "Religious views: It's complicated." "Relationship status: Engaged." Quite a catch, this fella! We can always bring him in, question him. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. We... We stop by, he's not there. He hears we showed up, he's off to Brazil. I don't want to spook him. You know, we just sit tight, keep him under surveillance, get a positive lD from the masseuse and nail him. And the hunt for the so-called "Craigslist Killer" is intensifying, with police hoping to catch him before he strikes again. Jeff Rossen has the latest now from Boston. See? This is way better. The police are literally going hotel to hotel now here in the Boston area... Wow, this is everywhere. ...showing these surveillance photos around. That could be anybody. They're worried he's planning his next attack. -I'm gonna be right back. -Yeah, are you all right? Yeah. Over the weekend, investigators pored through nearly two... if you're still mad, i'd just rather we called the whole thing off. You certainly have an... -Until i met you... -Hey, you know what? ...i didn't know it was possible either. Let's get out of here. -What? -I don't know. Let's go somewhere, yeah? You and me, right now. I'm getting my cabin fever. Those crazy stories on the news, and we've been studying so much... I know, but I have an exam, and if I want to reapply to med school, I can't fail my senior year. Okay, then we'll just... Let's bring your books, you know? We can bring your books, and you can study. You know? We can check into a hotel, we get some room service. We can order some movies, we can do some other things. We should go to Foxwoods. No, no, no, we should go to Foxwoods. It'll be like a pre-honeymoon. I don't know if it's a good idea to be gambling right now. No, no, no, we're not gambling. There's a spa. We can go to the spa and just get away from all this noise. -Really? -Doctor's orders. -Okay. -Yeah? Here we go. Who are you, pretty lady? Next victim? No, no, no. Not his MO. What's with the suitcases? Skipping town? Get a picture. I don't want to make our move until we get a positive lD from Trisha Leffler. Seems a little jumpy. If I had a pretty girl like that hanging on my arm, I'd be a hell of a lot happier than he is. Maybe nice girls aren't his type. Hang in there, sweetheart. We're not gonna let you out of our sight. Looks like they're heading out of the city. Detective Frye, requesting State Trooper assistance. Pursuing suspect south on Congress Street. Late model SUV. Where the hell are you two going? Babe. Babe, would you let me? -What? We're just... -Hey, let's speed up. You want to go? Let's get there fast. Why not? Maybe not? You're the thrill-seeker of the family, remember? I'm just the sweet, little girl from Jersey. Fine. They're making a move. Heading for the 95. Screw the positive lD. All right, this is it. Call it. We're taking him down. What? Why are they pulling us over? I wasn't even speeding. Out of the car. Out of the car! -Get out of the car! -Hands on the dash! -Engine off. -Take her. Take her. -What is going on? -Get out of the car. -Keep your hands up. -What did I do? What... Wait! Philip Markoff, you're under arrest for the murder of Julissa Brisman. -What? -On the ground. That's crazy! Stop! Philip, tell them that they have the wrong person! We need to take you back to Boston and ask you some questions. Your car will be towed to the station. You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law. -What is going on? -You have the right to speak to an attorney. I love you. If you cannot afford one, one will be appointed by the court. Do you understand these rights as they've been read to you? Yes. Bag. This guy keeps an awful lot of books under his bed. I used to do the same thing in college. Cheaper than buying shelves. This, on the other hand, I did not have under my bed at school. We got him. Bingo! Nine millimeter. Bag! Grab the other side. We're gonna lift it. Tell me you never hid your socks underyour mattress? Trophy. How manyyou got there? Onlythree reported. Obviously, the others didn't want their mothers to know what they do for a living, right? With all due respect, detectives, you're embarrassing yourselves. All right? What do you got? You got superficial resemblance to what? An out-of-focus surveillance video? Well, we got flex cuffs, 16 pairs of women's panties and a nine millimeter. All right, well, you've got some party favors, and you've got some unwashed laundry, and, yeah, I bought a gun to protect my fiance. I mean, we live in a sketchy neighborhood, sir. Is that right? We spoke to the owner of the gun shop up in New Hampshire. He says he sold the gun to a "Brian Stevens"... ...whose lD happened to be in your top drawer. You want to explain to us why you purchased a weapon with somebody else's lD? Sir, I'm a straight-A medical student. And I'm getting married in a month. I mean, would you guys care to explain to me why I would go around and shoot prostitutes in hotel rooms? What, you still don't believe me? Ask around. You have no idea how wrong you are about Philip. Do you know where he was between He's dedicated his whole life to becoming a doctor and helping people. So, you don't know where he was between 9:00 and 11:00 on April 14th? He's a medical student, okay? He spends thousands of hours at the library and the lab, and I'm sure there's people there that have seen him. We'll be sure to check that out. There's nothing to check out. This is a huge mistake, okay? Philip is not a killer! Did you know that we found handcuffs, a nine-millimeter pistol and 16 pairs ofwomen's panties stuffed under your mattress? Did you know that? I'm marrying Philip on August 14th. You don't think I know my own fianc? You don't think that I would've known if there was a gun under my own bed? I don't know what you know, Miss McAllister. -Look, am I under arrest or something? -No. In fact, you're free to go. But you can't go back to your apartment. And your car's been impounded as evidence, so... If I'm free to go, then I'm going. Are you telling me that one of our top students is the Craigslist Killer? No, no, we're just investigating at this point, checking out his story. So, you're saying he was actually here studying, being a student? I'm saying he was actually here being a star in all of his classes. Look, Lieutenant, I don't know if you know just how hard it is to be a medical student. It's not physically possible for someone to do as brilliantly as Philip has done in one of the most competitive programs in the country, and then run offto Rhode lsland and commit these crimes. Not physically possible. How did these people get here? How did they know? -Dad, what... -Do not talk to them. I want you to go inside straight away. Oh, God! -You guys are on private property. -Go, go, go! You must step off of my property. Now! Seven! Seven! Seven! They won't even let me call him. I mean, he's in there all alone, and I can't even... I can't talk to him. I can't do anything. -Baby, I'm so sorry. -You know what, when this is all over, I'm going to make sure that he demands an apology, because a doctor cannot have an accusation like this hanging over his head. This is ridiculous. Look, we don't even really know what happened. Of course we know what happened. They arrested the wrong guy. That's what happened. I'm just saying, there's a lot of the story that we still don't know. Oh, my God. You guys are just like everybody else. You really think that he's a killer? You think that he's a killer, and I've been living with him this whole time? -No. -And I didn't know? -No. -That I'm that stupid? I mean, Mom, come on. If somebody came to the door and told you that Dad is a killer, would you believe him? -Oh, my God! -Sweetie, we just feel... Unfortunately, you are here today because you were given the wrong information, as was the public. Philip Markoff is a beautiful person, inside and out, and couldn't hurt a fly. A police officer in Boston, or several, is trying to make big bucks by selling a false story to the TV stations. What else is new? Philip is an intelligent man who is just trying to live his life. So, if you could leave us alone, we would appreciate it. We expect to marry in August and share a wonderful and meaningful life together. Thank you. Our boy sure picked the right girl. i have known Phil Markoff since sophomore year. i can't even put into words the disbelief i'm feeling right now. He was a great guy. i mean, he was not someone who would ever even own a gun. As Markoff is without resources, it's the taxpayers of Massachusetts who'll be footing the bill for his defense. Doing the honors will be well-known public defender, Robert Grossman. A public defender? That's insane! His parents aren't even paying for a lawyer? Dad, do you know somebody? We have to help him. Although Markoff is being kept away from the media, his attorney continues to publicly profess his client's... We got him. He's got a public defender. Is that right? pregnant. Trying to dodge statutory rape, he and his buddy kill her with a knife and a brick, and toss her in the gutter. Cops have fingerprints, DNA, confessions from both. The buddy gets 20 years. Ken Braniff gets Grossman as a lawyer, goes free. He's walking the streets of Boston today. That's not true. Is that true? Robert Grossman can make an alibi out of two sticks and a ball of twine. Then we need to make a preemptive strike on Markoff's alibis. -Was that the door? -I don't know. No reporters on the property. I'm gonna call the police. They are the police. -How are you, Megan? -Fine. -Good to see you again. -Detective Bennett, Boston P.D. She was lucky. She got out with only two busted ribs. He hit her so hard in the face, she's still having trouble seeing. You guys have the wrong guy, okay? Philip isn't capable of killing anybody. -Are you sure? -Everybody knows that the Boston Police Department is the worst in the country. This isn't about the Boston P.D. We're trying to figure out who murdered an innocent young woman. We have a positive lD from a woman he beat up and robbed in Rhode lsland. I believe in Philip, Lieutenant. Did you know your boyfriend posted on a sexual fetish website under the username "Sex Addict 53885"? Took it right off his hard drive. You guys could've put that on there. Digital forensics can prove that Philip made these postings Iong before he killed Julissa Brisman with a nine millimeter. Her skull fragments were found embedded in the wall in the hotel room. She died choking on her own blood. Sex Addict 53885 was into, and I quote, "Submission and humiliation." -All right, I'd like you to stop this now... -No, no, no. -No, I'd like you to... -Also on his list was "friendship and experimentation with transvestites and transsexuals." I said that's enough! That's not Philip. He's got a description of himself here. "Born February 12th, 1986. "6'4", blond, athletic. Eight inches, cut." That's enough! You guys are out of here. Does that physical description match your absolute knowledge ofyour fianc? -Detective, stop this now. -Get out of here. -ls that your perfect fianc? -Don't put that... Get them out of here! -You've done enough! -You stop this now. -Megan! -You want to bully people? Get out of my house. Leave our home now. You sure you want to do this to Megan? I thought you loved her. I didn't do it. You can spare everybody a lot of pain. You want her to see you like this? How ugly you are? I didn't do it. It's going to be a circus, Phil. There's going to be pictures. The media, they're going to turn you into a monster. You understand? Phil, talk to me, all right? I mean, I don't get it. You had everything. A beautiful girl who loved you, a bright future. Ifyou'd played your cards right, years from now, you'd be a rich doctor having dinner parties on the Vineyard with your wife and kids. Right? You'd be living the dream. Instead of rotting in here. Help me out, Phil. I need it to make sense for me. Why would you do this? Why would you hurt those people? Why would you throw it all away? We've been talking about Philip Markoff and allegations about other killers leading double lives, and frequently, the women who love them, or at least who always seem surprised -when the cops come calling... -That is not going to make you feel better. -lt won't? -No. I tried going over it in my head, and... You know, what didn't I see? He was... He was a med student. He worked late. He was on his computer late at night. How is that different from any other guy at B.U.? It's not. How was I supposed to make that leap? Megs, he fooled everybody, okay? He seemed like the perfect guy. Maybe I just wanted him to be perfect so bad that I only saw what I wanted to see. I loved him so much. It's okay. He made me feel like no one ever made me feel. Come here. I'm sorry. Number four. Megan. Did you get my suit back from the tailor? He was going to fix the button thing in the cuff. Philip, stop. The wedding's only a couple ofweeks away now. Stop it! I came here today because... I need you to look me in my eyes and tell me the truth. Can you do that, Philip? Please? I love you. I always will. Please, just tell me. Please? Maybe... Maybe the person who did this, maybe they didn't feel like they deserved all that they had. Maybe they didn't feel like they deserved someone as amazing as you. You're amazing. I love you. Maybe they felt like all they deserved was to be punished. I saw a picture of the gun. And the underwear that you put under the mattress. Our mattress. How many girls were there? Sixteen? Did you... Were you safe? Do I need to get tested? I mean, getting tested is a smart policy for anybody. Please don't do that. It said on your site that you were into bondage and cross-dressing. Did you do that stuff? Megan, sweetheart, maybe you can't believe everything you see on the lnternet. This whole time. You've been lying to me this whole time? You've been looking in my eyes and lying to me? I mean, what did I do? What did I do to deserve this? What did... What did I do? -I'm done here! -No, no, no. Megan! Baby, baby, baby! Baby! Baby, baby, please come back! Please! I'm scared! I'm scared to death in here. Please don't. Please. Please don't... Please. I'm never going to see you again. I love you, Pocket. We'll begin with these new details in the death of Philip Markoff, the accused Craigslist Killer. NBC's Jeff Rossen is in Boston. Jeff, good morning to you. Hi, Meredith, good morning to you. This morning, we're getting our first look inside Markoff's cell. And just to paint the picture for you here, police say he had photos of his ex-fiance spread out all over, it appears. According to investigators, this is the last thing he was looking at before he committed suicide. After he stabbed himself, he wrote messages to her on the wall in blood, in a spot where he could see it, but she couldn't. it was her name, and then he wrote something else, which they believe may be a secret message. And a big oak tree in the front yard. It's got to be big enough to build a tree house in, though. Yes, for our three kids. No, four. Four kids. Four kids? Watch out. That's four college educations. -Two med school, two law school. -Okay. Yes, but, lest we forget, their dad is the head of surgery at an internationally-renowned teaching hospital. And Mom just had a huge breakthrough in cancer research. -Okay, so make it five kids. -Okay. Four boys in a row, and then after, a girl, so she could be really protected. Well, if she looks anything like her mother, she is going to need it. I'm crazy about you, Megan McAllister.
