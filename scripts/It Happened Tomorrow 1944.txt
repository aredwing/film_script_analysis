Are you ready, Amelia? - Yes, Andrew. Believe me if all those Endearing young charms Which I gaze on so fondly today Were to change by tomorrow And fleet in my arms, Like fairy gifts fading away Thou would'st still be adored As this moment thou art... What's wrong, Andrew? They're arguing. Dear great Grandma... ...and dear great Grandpa... No, No, Larry, you mustn't. I simply won't let you do it. For 50 years you've kept me from publishing this. Because I love you. I don't want you to be laughed at. But, at least, I want to read it to my family. They'll never believe it unless they hear it from me. I've heard it for 50 long years and I still don't believe it. Now, come on dear, the children are waiting. They might think we're arguing! But I'm not arguing, my love. This story is true. It tells what happened to me. Now Larry. You just don't believe in miracles. Don't try to tell it, darling. Nobody believes in miracles nowadays. ...gloomy winter Then reigns o'er us no more. I would not die in Springtime... ...When all is bright around... ...And fair young flowers are peeping... ...From out the silent ground. When life is on the water... ...And joy upon the shore For winter, gloomy winter... Then reigns o'er us no more. I would not die in Springtime... What is this? A newspaper office or a saloon? A newspaper office Mr Gordon. - Have a drink Mr Gordon? - I never drink. I mean in this office. But, Mr Gordon. This is my party. I'm saying farewell to the dead. Dead? - Who died, Stevens? - 500 people. 500 obituaries that I've written. Well, no more obit's for me. Remember the front page is written in the morning. If you are going to be a reporter, from now on better get to sleep early I can go to sleep right now Mr Gordon. Hey look! I'm going to sleep right now! Careful, my boy. You're laying right in the middle of 1843. Well, not a bad place to sleep Pops! A bed of ancient news! Well, you just be careful with my files. Ah, there's nothing as dead as yesterday's news! Yesterday's news? You've no imagination, young man. News is what happens. What's the difference whether it happens 50 years ago... ...or tomorrow? You mean, Will happen tomorrow. No. Time is only an illusion. Look. March 18, 1875. To the people then, this was the future; wasn't it? Well, supposing we were all living on that date in 1875... ...and I arrived with this book. I can tell you everything that will happen. Well, give me the one for the year we're living in now Pop... and you can name your own price! But it's here, my boy. They're all here. Look. 19th century 20th century. I can't quite see the 20th, Pop. Unfortunately we can't. But if we could... Look... We know what will happen in say...1906. That's too far away, Pop. I'd like to know what'll happen next year. No. Just 24 hours from now! I did the front page with my first story. That's what I want Pop, tomorrow's newspaper. How much? No, Larry. No. Don't ask a thing like that Oh, come on. Come on, lets have it Pop, Huh? I wish I could Then you'd learn it's no good to know the future We've all got to die someday.. ...but, if we knew the day. Even if it was 20 years off... I'd have a corking good time for 20 years. My boy. Every day of your life would be poisoned. If I knew where I could get tomorrows newspaper... ...I'd give 10 years of my life for it. How do you know you've got 10 years? He's got you there, Larry. Forget about tomorrow. Do you want me to tell you what's gonna happen in the next 5 minutes? Sure. - We'll all be thirsty. There's no more beer. I'm gonna hope that somebody else buys it. - Wanna come along, Pop? - No, I haven't time. - See you tomorrow. - Tomorrow. Tomorrow. Wait a minute, fellas. Wait a minute. If you're interested in the future, look there. Cigolini. With a name like that he'll tell your future in Italian. Yeah, and you won't know what he's talking about. He won't either. He's just a faker. - Yeah, but look at the girl! - Yeah, she's pretty; that's no fake. That's a fake too. They all look good on posters. What we need is a drink. Come on. Inside, you'll find she's fair, fat and forty! And now, my friend. Tell me, what is the number in the case of your watch. - I don't know. - You don't know? - You have a watch, haven't you? - Oh, for sure. - May I see it please? - Well, I had it... Well, look... There is your watch now. It's funny how these trifles get misplaced. Sylvia. Do you hear me? I hear you. Now, listen carefully. Do you see inside the case of this watch? I will try. Tell me, what is the number inside the case of this watch? Two, Seven, Nine... Oh, I can't. You've got to Sylvia. I compel you. Three, Three, Five... ...Ninety-four. Aha! Is that correct my friend? Thank you very much. Thank you Sir. Step right down - Can we have another chair please? - Yes, Sir. Thank you. I beg your pardon. My friend, she cannot hear you she only hears the voice of The Cigolini. She is in a trance. Then tell her I beg her pardon. Young man, she is unaware of your presence... ...she can only see the invisible. Could you make me invisible? That you can do for yourself. By sitting down! Thank you. And now, my friend, what is your question? I gave it to you. Sure, Sure. Tell me, my friend, is this your handwriting? That's it alright. We get this question here every night. Miss Sylvia has unveiled this part of the future. I'm very sorry my friend but you lose your bet. William McKinley is a very worthy man. Sorry, Sorry... ...but the republican party don't have no chance The next President of United States will be William Jennings Bryan. Thank you, my friend. That is all. And now ladies and gentlemen, at this time... Just a minute, there's a seor here who don't seem to agree with me. Tell me, what are you a republican? Professor, I have a question. It concerns a certain young lady. And you want to know if she's going to have the misfortune to marry you? Is that it? All I want to know is whether she'll have lunch with me tomorrow. Young seor wants to know... if the girl he loves is going to have lunch with him tomorrow. - Yes, she will. - Thank you. But I'd like to know where we'll meet. My friend, that you have to arrange with the lady yourself. That I'd like to do, but she can't hear me. She's in a trance. Just a minute, my good friend... ...Cigolini has put the young lady's mind to sleep... ...and Cigolini is not sure just when she is going to awaken. And that is why Miss Sylvia will be unable to accept... ...any social engagements. Hello. Remember me? No, I'm afraid I don't. But you answered my question. I was asleep. Besides, you were very rude How do you know I was if you were asleep? May I take you home? No, Thank you. You mean, I can't come inside? I always go home alone. 105 North Elm Street. Driver. And take it easy. Go slow. No, go fast I'm in a hurry. I'm in no hurry. Take your time. Now, listen to me Who hired this cab? The gentleman did, Miss. He's kept me here waiting for half an hour. It's a pleasure. You don't mind my riding with you in my own cab,do you? I certainly do. - Cabbie. - I'm sorry, I've hired this cab. You've hired it, huh? Well, why don't you get into it? Alright cabbie, take 'em away. Twenty-three skidoo! Thank you, Professor. And don't try to see her again. You'd better drive on. My uncle might see you. Goodnight. I can look into the future myself. You're going to see me again. Very soon. You see? My prediction was right. I told you I'd see you again very soon. Oh, be careful. Go away. Oh no. Not 'til I know whether you're prediction is right or not. - Prediction? - Don't you remember? Seor would like to know... ...if the girl he loves will have lunch with him tomorrow. You said she will. I never remember anything I say when I'm in a trance. Well, in case you do I'll be waiting for you at the Evening News office tomorrow 'til 1 o'clock. Goodnight. Wait... ...the name is Stevens. Lawrence Stevens. Just ask for Larry. Larry! Larry! Larry! Oh, it's you Pop. You gave me a scare. Don't tell me you've been drinking alone? What are you doing here so late?

The young lady tells me you can read the future. Is that right? Future? Past, present and future! Then you could have predicted what happened today? Why, sure, sure, anything. Then your niece was telling the truth when she said you predicted this. Sure, sure. Oh, sure, we predicted this It happens all the time. Now are you going to stay and see our act Mr Beckstein?

I'm police Inspector Mulrooney. Police? and if I were you, the next time you make a prediction like this... ...I would inform the police. You'll find it safer. Professor Cigolini... ...How about predicting something that will happen now... ...tonight or tomorrow? Seor, my medium is far sighted... ...things that are too close sometimes are out of focus Then how did she predict the hold-up that took place today? You're right my friend, I forgot. Sometimes she can see things like that Sometimes? What about now? I'm sorry but our time is up You'll have to ask that question some other time Will something happen tonight? A crime?... ...fire, theft, murder or something like that? Sylvia, I know you are very tired but... do you see anything going to happen tonight? I can't hear you I told you she was very tired She can't even hear me Speak louder! Sylvia try, try hard What do you see? I see nothing. That shows it's a moonless night. How can anybody see anything in the dark Thank you, Professor I am not in the dark... ...I see an open and shut case. Wait a minute, Seor. Wait... Now... now I see in the darkness. It is night. Yes, tonight. I see a river...a bridge... I see a woman walking Then what happens? She jumps. She's in the water. She goes under. I don't see her anymore. All you've got to do is talk, son, and you'll be out of here Just tell us where we can collar them desperados. Try and remember. I tell you I don't know. I'll be outside if you want to talk to me. Think it over It wasn't worth 10 years of your life, was it? Pop! Pop, where have you been? I've been looking all over for you Oh just around, my boy. Did I meet you last night or did I dream it? Tell me, did you give me a newspaper? It didn't do you any good did it Larry? Oh Pop, I'm in a jam. Nobody believes me. I can't get out of here Why don't you say something? What are you looking at me like that for? I'm kinda surprised to see you here, that's all I figured you'd be on your way to the river by this time You ought to be there a little after midnight. You've got to be. Who says so? Why, I just read it. Don't tell me that's the next tomorrow's paper. Isn't that what you want? No! - You want to tell me something? - No! Yes! Maybe... wait. Pop, does it say anything in the paper about those bandits? Here it is. - They've been arrested. - When were they? Where? Tomorrow morning in the Union Bank. The police were waiting for them. You wrote that! What about me? Oh, you'll be a hero - For telling the police? - No. I better read it to you "Unknown woman makes suicide leap. Jumps to death from 9th street bridge. Larry Stevens. "Evening News" Reporter... ...makes heroic attempt at rescue in river. Body not yet recovered - Shortly after midnight..." - Now I don't believe a word of it. Why, it says so here But I'm being held here. I can't get away. Even if I could I wouldn't go to the river Even if I did I wouldn't jump in What kind of monkey do you think I am... to risk my life for a woman I don't know... when I do know she can't be saved. Don't ask me my boy. I'm no prophet. - I'm just reading this. - Enough... ...I never want to hear of that paper again. You hollering for me? No, get outta here and leave me alone. Look, if you let me out I'll tell you where you can get those bandits. Now we're getting somewhere. Tomorrow morning at the Union Bank. All you have to do is wait for them. Come along, Mister. Alright, Stevens, Alright We'll be waiting at the bank. But if you're fooling us, remember we know where to pick you up You can go now. Thanks, Inspector. Where's Miss Smith? I owe her an apology. Miss Smith disappeared after the show Mr Stevens Her uncle says he don't know where she's gone. That's right, I don't know. But he knows. Listen, this guy's trying to steal my niece. She's infatuated with him. Say that again please. Listen you, you whippersnapper I'll hit you over the head... Alright, shut up the both of you. Before you go Stevens I'd like to get to the bottom of this. At what time did the girl tell you about the hold-up? - She didn't tell me at all. - Of course she didn't. - Now you're lying. - Listen, I aint lying. A couple of hours ago you admitted it I didn't know you was a police Inspector Oh, I see You don't understand. I was just putting on an act for Beckstein That's Barnum & Baileys big man. Don't you understand? How could you... You're an intelligent man? How could you believe that we could predict anything that we don't know nothing about? And by the way, who heard the prediction? Did you hear it? I didn't No, but I did hear the prediction tonight? Ah, that's bunk Inspector. Bunk! How could she know anything about a bridge and a river and a woman commiting suicide? Now, how could she? Did Sylvia say that? Shut up. She was just trying to get us out of a tight hole. You too. Bridge...river? Did she say the body would never be found? She didn't say that. - Now... - She didn't know. What is this nonsense? Don't let that guy get away. You'd keep him in here if you know your business If I know my business, you're coming with me. - Wait. - Come on. What happened? What's the matter? A woman just jumped in the river! I saw her! Save her, Save her! - Somebody better dive in. - That's the idea. - Go ahead, jump. - I can't swim. - I can't either. - Niether can I. Officer, Officer. Can you see her? No, no we can't see anything. Then there is no use for me diving in. I better get a boat. Hurry, Officer. Hurry! Did she do it? Now, don't get excited. We'll save her. - Oh, I know you won't. - You know, eh? Are you her husband? - No, let me go - Wait. Just who are you anyway? Larry Stevens. "Evening News". What a man! If I could swim, I'd do it too. - What was his name? - Stevens. "Evening News". What they won't do to get a story! Sylvia, Sylvia! Larry. What are you doing here? Now you've spoiled everything. Sylvia darling, I knew you were in danger. I wasn't. I was just trying to save you. It looks like we were both trying to save each other. I had to make a prediction... ...and I had to make it look like it really happened. Oh you wonderful, foolish little darling. - Yes, but I didn't know... - You didn't know what? That the water would be so cold. Now I know the newspaper was wrong. Newspaper? Oh, never mind. You're here alive. I found you. There's the boat. Look! Her hat floating. Her hat maybe, but the girl must have gone down like a stone. Let's go on further. Yeah, no hurry. It'll be just another case of body not recovered Did you hear that? That's what I want them to think. "Body not recovered" Gee Whizz! and if I get it that'll be the headline What if they find me here Don't worry, they won't I know they won't Now you can put me down. No, No you're dripping wet. How can I explain a girl's tax in the hallway? Open the door. Sylvia? Alright, you can come in now. Hey, you're just a little thing aren't you. I feel perfectly silly How can I go home like this? There's nobody on the street this time of night... ...and besides, you look very respectable. You need a shave. What's the matter with your tie? I nearly choked myself trying to tie it the way you do. Let me do it Sorry Look, you take both ends like this, you see? and you put right over left No, you cross left over right I'm all mixed up Oh, it's backwards for me, come over here. Now, that's better. Watch closely. You might have to do this for your husband some day You know, on you this suit looks good It's the first time I've liked it I'm sorry, I looked in the closet and couldn't find a girls dress anyplace. I should hope not. As a matter of fact, I don't care. Well I'm glad you're not the jealous type What would I be jealous of? Well if you cared at all I'd have to tell you that... ...I'm a very busy character... ...I haven't got time to be interested in girls. Last night in the cab you didn't act like a man... who's not interested in girls. Last night? Great Scott! What? Was it only last night we met. You mean to tell me, all this happened since last night? Sure, I met the old man on the way home after I left you. Give me your newspaper I want to read it. Oh, he didn't give it to me tonight, he only read it to me. Well, the old man was outside the window and I... Oh, what's the use? Nobody believes us Larry, you have a wonderful imagination... You ought to join our act. Maybe you could read a number inside a watch By the way, how do you do that trick?. We magicians never reveal our secrets. Right, Larry? But I have no secrets, I'm telling you the truth. Last night, when the old man gave me the paper I didn't even read it... ...but this morning... Larry! Oh Larry, this is awful. I fell asleep.
