You have 12 hours... to do any crime you want against anyone you want. You can shoot, kill, stab. Twelve hours of death, mayhem. Lock your doors. Protect yourself. Make sure your rent is paid... and all of your pets are put up. But the most important rule of all... stay tight, stay white... and this is only gonna last one night. Let the games begin. All right, I wasn't gonna do this, but forget it. Here goes nothing. This is a story about the worst day of my life. Well, one of them. See, I was wiring shit, car stereos, alarms, you name it. Don't Hate Wiring, that's my company. And that's me, Carl Black. You see this ugly cat right here? That's Key Flo, a big-time drug dealer. One day while working on his alarm... Key Flo got busted. They took his ass far away. What they didn't know was in his house was a loz' of money. $0 I took i2' as a payment for all the work I did. With a payday like this... it was time to move. Well, I did owe a few people in Chicago a few things... but no one's tripping. So I loaded up the family and got the hell out of Chicago. Leaving Chicago before the Purge... was the greatest thing I ever done. I met this cool dude on the Internet... who helped us qualify for this big-ass house in Beverly Hills. I might've falsified a few things... but, hey, this is for my family. Those are my kids. My son Carl Jr. thinks he's a damn vampire. Think again, buddy. And this dummy with this do-rag? That's my little cousin Cronut. He went to jail for some parking tickets... and now he think he's a gangster. Ride my mustache. That's my beautiful wife. Did I mention the greatest thing about my move? Rich people don't purge. Getting the hell out of Chicago... was the best thing ever. Well, here's how the worst day started. Hey, come on, man! Hey, how you doing, sir? - You lost? - I beg your pardon? Man, you gotta be. Check this out. Go right down here, make a U-turn... then you can pull right out, and you'll get back... to wherever it is you need to get to. - I live here. - No. No, I'm serious, man. I live right there at Cherry Blossom. - I'm Carl Black. - Black? You said Carl Black? I just moved from Chicago. Man, listen, I'm gonna be real with you, man. Don't no niggas live here, man. I'm the nigga that living here! I'm the new nigga that living here, all right? Save me some trouble, man. We've been having all these break-ins... and the rappers dance, loud mus... rims. Come on, man. Look at you, man. You can't live here, man. Go on and make... Don't fucking try to play me like this! I live here! I'm fucking crazy! Look at my eye right here. - Forest Whitaker eye. - Okay, you're right. I see. I found it. You're right. Carl Black. Right here. Carl Black. - You said I can go? - My bad, man. Thank you, brother. Have a nice day, man. I'm sorry. - I'm sorry. - Bitch. Please don't tell me your ass is in California. Don't call my phone no more. You told me you were going to the store! - I'm married now. - You're married? You keep blowing up... Look, you pissing me off... to the highest of "pisstivity." "Pisstivity" ain't even a word, dumb-ass. Shoranda, I don't wanna be over at your house... with all them kids over there smelling like urine. I know you didn't just say that about my kids. You bitch, nigga! Come out! Come to me! Everybody is gonna come in your house... they're gonna fuck you! I've traveled a long way to find you. Hey! Caesar! Don't try to play me. You're Carl Black from Chicago, right? Yeah, and you're Caesar from The Planet of the Apes, right? Do I look like a fucking joke to you? - Yeah. - Consider yourself served. Hey, man! Don't hit me with no... don't do that! Don't do that. You're harassing me. You're at my mansion. I'm in Beverly Hills. No, don't do that. If you didn't do nothing wrong... if you was a perfect human being... none of this shit would happen. - I wouldn't have to be here. - I ain't did nothing wrong! You're racial profiling me! You're too black to profile another black person. - What's wrong? - "Do I think you're black"? Look at me and look at you! - We are both black people. - You are black as fuck. What the fuck? Don't say that. Don't put that Ebola finger in my face. No - Look at your feet. What the fuck is wrong with my feet? You think this shit is a game? You fucking redbone bitch... don't ever disrespect my feet like that again. - I'm not disrespecting you. - Yes, you are... and it's because of your company... that Don't Hate Wiring... that has destroyed the best restaurant... - No, don't-- - Not just restaurant. African restaurant in the city of Chicago! Who else have you fucked up? I done wired all these different houses. I'm from the hood. I made it out of there. We wired Bishop Tutu's hut. We wired ldi Amin's bathroom. So get on out of here, man. You're very disrespectful. - Well, you bitch nigga. - No, you're a bitch nigga. And whatever container you came in... and whatever trunk they smuggled your black ass in... take your ass back. Hey, who are you talking to? - Bitch. - Hey! - Don't touch! - Throw them keys again. Don't touch me! Hey, my hand! Fuck you, you redbone bitch. - Fuck you. - You haven't made it yet... you punk-bitch nigga. Your mother's dick is bigger than yours. You're the only nigga in this neighborhood... that is still on welfare. Yes, I Googled you. Get the fuck off the door. Don't worry, Lestat. We will teach them all! As the purging descends... the vampires will take their rightful place... as the leaders of the-- shit! Man. - What the fuck! - Intruder! Intruder! - Punk-ass alert- - What the hell is that? Punk-ass alert. - Yeah. - Carl's Jr., get this shit out of here! Carl's Jr.! I'll bite your neck. Little bad motherfucker. I'm getting rid of these damn kids. Is anybody here? I mean, we done really came up. We in a mansion, girl. - Damn, girl! - I know! Girl, what your daddy do to leave Chicago? I don't know what my father's doing... but he done did something really, really dope. Baby! Tell me about your husband. Your husband play football? Well, my baby owns an electronic wiring company... and he just landed this huge account. That's why we're here. And what he does is he goes to people's houses... he wires people's cars... and he just landed this amazing new client. That's why we can live here. - How long you been here? - Girl, three days. What do you do all day... Ming, I take care of his kids. - You see this house? - Hey. Hey, baby! Damn, you haven't finished unpacking? You're out here getting your nails done... and looking all good and... - And what's going on? - I'm getting a manicure. - Plum wine. - You're looking good, too. Lord, Jesus! Baby. All for you, my love. Good lord, give me some of that Chinese-- My fault. I'm sorry, I can't play a little bit? - Stop playing. - She wanted a nigga. She's my new friend. - Leave her alone. - I know, I know. - I'm just kidding. - Stop playing. - He lie. He lie. - I know he's lying. - I know him. - These manicure hoes is on me now. You know what I'm saying? That's what I'm talking about. All he does is jack off all day. Okay, Carl. Carl, I'm gonna need you... to turn around really slowly... because you don't believe when I tell you this. - You see this tongue. - He is so gross. Ride my mustache. - Ride-- Oh, shit! - Cronut! - Baby, that's not right. - Did he have his little nuts out... - just there in the window? - No, his tongue was enough. It's just wrong, baby. I don't-- He's probably smelling your panties in there... - lying around the house. - Oh, lord. Man, hide your underwear around the bedroom. Shit. - Are you gonna answer that? - Yeah, I got it. Yeah, this might be-- Oh, that ain't nothing. - Carl, pick up your phone. - What? I can't answer the phone. Ain't nothing but my friends from Chicago. - What friends from Chicago? - A bunch of drug dealers... and all kind of crazy motherfuckers... baby mamas, I can't answer the phone. - That's why I moved out here. - Okay, all done! - Okay, Ming, I just need one more thing. - $100. $100. $100 what'? Oh, tonight Purge! Killing, death. - Wait, wait, wait, wait. Purge? - Killing. - I need to go home. - Carl. People keep saying Pur-- We in Beverly Hills. This is a gated community. We've got security. We don't have no Purge problems. Not tonight. Need to go home. - 100, please. - Yeah. - 100 in what? - $100. It's a Purge coming. Ain't nothing you can do with no $100. - Once the Purge comes-- - Carl, cash, money! Just pay her the $100, please, baby. - $100. Let me handle this. - Ming. Ming, listen to me. Pay me cash! I told you that I was gonna pay you in credit. Credit is king in America, okay? Pay me in cash, or I purge your ass tonight, bitch. - Come on, you done disrespecting me. - What the hell? Just pay her. - You said you were rich. - I tried to give you a chance... but you disrespected me. Get your ass out of here, both of y'all. I'm gonna fuck your wife! I'm gonna crush her pussy! Back up, Wesley Snipes and his new wife. What? Who is that African man? Wesley Snipes. He just got out of jail. You didn't hear-- - Carl. - I ain't gotta play. Baby- stop- Come on. Don't do that. I can't do it. - Come on. - Can't do what? - What is the deal? - Who was that man? I don't know who they was. They's people from my past, okay? It wasn't Wesley Snipes, though. I mean, he was black as hell like him, but it wasn't him. Carl, the only thing I need to know from you right now... I swear you better not lie. - Do we have this money? - We got the money. Look, your ass is standing in a big-ass mansion. I bought you a brand-new car. What the hell? What are you worried about? I'm worried about how you got it. What did you do to get it? Okay, what did I do? I did a little dancing in Atlanta. Male gigoloing. Did something strange for a little piece of change. No. No, for real. Look, I got a chain of Wing and Things that I landed. That's what I'm doing. I'm going around... hooking up wiring all over from here to San Diego. Baby, I want to believe you... but I can't keep uprooting this family... in the middle of the night again. I can't do that, okay? These kids need to trust me. They need to believe that we're in a family... that we're a unit, that they're secure. - I don't feel that right now. - Babe, the kids do trust you. They hate me, Carl. The kids don't hate you. No, they don't. You guys just need... to get to know each other a little bit. - I'm trying. - And I know that you're getting upset. It's irritating you to see little Carl Jr... running around here with a little Batman outfit... with his little ass cheeks cut out. - It's a vampire. - Okay, a vampire outfit. And Allie's running around with Mr. Frosty... - whoever the fuck he is. - His name is Freeze. Yeah, I'ma freeze his ass. That's what I'ma do. Please trust me on this. - I have trusted you. - Well, keep trusting me, then. We got the Wings and Things... we got the house, we got the car. Look, let's enjoy this. - You living the life. - Okay. I'm gonna believe you. - Believe me. - Bye-bye. Carl Black! And you are Mexican and black. - Carl, goodbye. - I'll be right back, all right? We interrupt our program... to bring you this important message. As everyone knows, tonight is the Purge. - Oh, my God. - Ana' you know why we gotta purge. First of all... for all of you who keep thieving... killing, selling drugs that we can '2' tax... for all you who ain't paying your child support... but just bought a brand-new Xbox and some Jordans. I'm talking to bankers making a cool million... each time you sneeze... while the public can't afford to pay the mortgages... that you sold them. So tonight, as Americans... we Purge- Hey, if you ain't done nothing wrong... you got nothing to worry about. Purge ain't about you. It's about the rest of you. And you know who you are. Good thing we're in Beverly Hills. Yeah. Knock, knock. Yeah! They gonna love this back in Chicago. Somebody's got to do it. Yeah, we're in the money! We got money! Where'd you get all this money from? - Damn, girl! - Hold on, hold on, girl. - Hold on. - All right. What? Who is this? Hey, girl, let me call you back. You better call Freezee. You know he be tripping. - All right. - Love you, girl. All right, love you, too. Bye! Bye! This is some dumb shit. Big Sean! Oh, nigga, I thought you was Big Sean. Freezee! What are you doing here? You scared me half to death. You know I couldn't be in Chicago without you, baby. I'm rich. If you say you're my friend, you're my friend! My dad! Baby, how did you get here? - You don't have a car. - Baby, with love like ours... I don't need a car. I took the Greyhound. - You took the Greyhound? - Three days and three nights... just like Jesus Christ did in the desert with Moses... Adam and Eve. "Holy-lujah." Baby. Oh, my God. If Dad catches you here... you know he's gonna kill you. Look, I'ma take my chances with your dad. Matter of fact, it might be nice to see him. - Pop him one time. - What? - Call him "pop" one time. - Stop it. - Pop that nigga one time. - Baby, stop it. - Allie Black! - I've been going to church for you. Well, then why did Keisha say... you was with that thot Valerie last night, then? - Keisha be talking bullshit! - Nah. You can't be believing Keisha, man. Baby, I love you. Look at me, look at me. Repeat after me, baby. I... - I. - Love. - Love. - Sex. I knew you wanted the D, baby. - Let me get it one time from the back. - Allie! Bet you didn't think I'd be participating tonight. Purge? They're still on that shit? Bu! your president is a man of the people. And like you, I got the urge to purge. Purge these nuts. It's going down, y'all. Jay Leno, you got a lot of cars. Pick a fast one, motherfucker. Allie, the TV's fucked up again. Hey, nigga! Fuck you, "i993! Shut the fuck up, nigga. Hold on, you ain't gonna be treating me like no side bitch. Baby, please, please. You're gonna get me in trouble! - You're gonna get me in... - Allie! Say, "Fuck you, Dad," and then make me a sandwich. - Make me a sandwich. - Okay, I'll make you... a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. - Allie! - All right, Daddy, I'm coming! All right, Daddy, fuck you! - I said it in your voice. - Shut up! Allie Black! - What's up, Daddy? - Don't you hear me calling you? I'm trying to-- What are you doing? - Nothing. - ...no place that you are safe. I'm trying to get this TV working. It's on some bullshit. Well, dang, Daddy, ain't this what you do for a living? Yeah, but I didn't wire this shit up. Some white man wired this up. This ain't nigga-rigged. Hey, you know what would be great? Two birds with one stone? If you could hide in Erik Estrada's house. Everything on here is the Purge. - I know. - You ain't gonna be able... to watch nothing else today. It's the government, the Purge. All right, well, we ain't scared of no damn Purge. - We're from Cook County. - What? We grew up on food stamps. That's the Purge. - Shit. - We know this life. - First and 15. - What? - Nigga. - Yeah. - Fix the TV. - All right. Arnold Schwarzenegger, I'ma be out there. Let me get this call. - $0 go do if now- - Hello? I'm gonna take this for myself, bitch. - He called me down here for nothing. - I live in Beverly Hills now. I don't live in Chicago. Locating enemy target. Locating enemy target. Target locked. Carl's Jr., stop it! Junior, you get that out of here! Holy shit! You know what? Carl needs me. He needs me to take all this. Thank you. Just take all this little money. And all this weed in the house. We got kids in here. Cronut! Freezee, you can't stay here. - You-- - What you mean? - Look, you gotta go. - Where am I supposed to go? I don't know, but you can't stay here, nigga. - You gotta go. - It's sundown, baby. I'll get my ass purged quick. Baby, I've seen it. - They purge niggas like me quick. - I don't wanna get you purged. Well, then-- I mean, what... - Come on. - My dad, man. I'll handle your dad. Let me stay. Please let me stay. Come on. Do it for us. Let me put the tip in. Let me stay. Pick one or the other. All right. Okay. - Okay, I can smash? - No! You can stay, but you-- Baby, listen to me. You have to be quiet. My dad don't play that shit. Baby, you gotta be quiet 'cause you know when I lay it down... - Okay, okay, okay. - Shut up. 45, 47. - Carl? - What's up? - We need to talk. - I thought we already talked. - Where's the kids? - Cronut's disgusting. - Cronut? - Allie and Carl's Jr. both hate me. - I don't know what to do, Carl. - Come on, just have a seat. Come on, come on, come on, relax. Just talk to me. What is the deal? I can't live in this house... knowing that there is a man fully masturbating to me. There's a tent coming up in his pants every time I'm around. Okay, okay, look. Cronut, he been in jail. He's been in prison. He's a little weird. - But let me control that, okay? - When? I'm gonna get ahold of his little ass. Relax. Let me get the little leprechaun in my possession. - Kick his ass out. - Look, I'ma go talk to Cronut... and we're gonna have a family meeting. We're gonna get together. Let's-- Let me handle it, okay? - Okay. Okay. - All right. - Thank you. - Okay, baby. All right, let me go talk to Allie. I gotta find a way to make this family work. Shit. Cronut! Cronut. Cronut. Cronut. Don't be playing around, Cronut. Yeah, you see this? You see it? You ride my mustache. Ride my mustache. Don't act like you don't-- Don't act. - What are you doing? - Come on, cuz. We cousins. - Don't be scaring me like that. - I asked you to come out here, man... and look at my SUV, man... and change the oil. What the fuck is this? I was trying to change the oil, man... but the oil's so gooky and shit... it's like dried-up nut. I can't do that. I don't need no little shade tree mechanic running around here. If you don't know what you're doing, take my shit to Midas. I do know what I'm doing. It's made me come up with great ideas. - A great idea like what? - A million-dollar idea. - A million-dollar idea? - Yeah. - With brand-new SUV? - Brand-new? It was brand-new when civil rights movement was going on. It's a one owner. One owner? Who was the one owner, Jesus? Nah, man! A white lady had it in her garage... - and never drove it. - Was it Driving Miss Daisy? What's that little bolt right there? - Which one? - Goddamn mouth. - What's with you, bro? - Talking about my shit ain't brand-new. - Man, you need counseling, bro. - You do, too. No, I don't. You do, man. 'Cause I got great ideas. I'm trying to help you out... make this situation better for both of us... 'cause I got this great idea. Let me tell you about it, man. All right, hear me out, bro. Here's what I'm thinking. These models are notorious... for having electrical problems that start fire. So what I'm thinking is speeding up the process. That way, this bitch explodes... - you feel what I'm saying? - Yeah. If it explodes... we get a new model, and a big settlement. And if I get a big settlement, boom! So you think you're gonna get a settlement for blowing up in this truck? - If I'm in it. - You're gonna blow up? I'm not gonna blow all the way up. I'm not gonna die, that'd be stupid. All I'm gonna do is just burn my whole front of my body. Like you know how Kunta Kinte's back is? That's how the front of my chest's gonna look... Dumb as a box of fucking rocks. You got a bad bitch now... No, no, no, no. And speaking of a bad bitch... stop fucking with my wife around here. No, for real. Stop jacking off to her... - stop watching her. - Who told you? They snitching on me? No, she told me. You've been running around here... with your little dinkle out and stuff. - Cut it out! - Did she tell you she don't like you... 'cause you look like Lionel Richie? I don't look like no fucking Lionel Richie. - Yes, you do. - No, I don't look like Lionel Richie. You gotta look at it from my point of view. I've been locked up for two years now. I know. I put money on your fucking books. So I haven't seen nobody that fine-- I ain't seen no woman. - All I've been seeing is dick. - Hey, hey, hey, hey! Like, I mean, like, them niggas-- - Them niggas in jail got big-ass dicks. - I don't wanna hear that shit! We in shower, they swinging dick everywhere. Shit missed and bumped me in my elbow... - and I was on the other side of the room. - Okay, enough. Enough with other men. That too much. Well, let me fuck your old lady. I won't talk about 'em no more. What did I just say about you, Cronut? You think it's a fucking game. Stop playing. - All right. - We're having a family meeting... in 10 minutes. Get my truck, put back the fuck together... - and get in there on the meeting. - All right. Take that black curtain rod off your head. - No, I got wave caps. - That ain't a wave cap. - I'm trying to get waves. - Them is fingerprints in your head. No, this is nice waves. Yes, boss. I's-a getting to it. Treat me like I'm a goddamn slave. I'm your peoples! Now, this is a family meeting for the Blacks. Now, I'm a little upset... that you guys haven't been appreciative... of this big mansion that I put you in. You know I'm grateful. You don't get no more "gratefu-ker" than me. Kids, I did all this, guys, for you. Well, Daddy, we didn't ask for this. - You need to get Ray Rice. - Carl, do you see... - Cronut, shut the fuck up. - Yes, Your Highness. I've been trying to get this Wings and Things account... so that I can give you guys a better life... so I can put some smiling faces on your face. All right, how about a smile? Listen, we are here to have a good time. No iPhones, no iPads. - What? - Put that shit down. - We're rich... - Rich. We're black, and we're going for a walk. You guys couldn't even walk in Chicago... - Let's go. - Listen to what the man's saying! - You heard Father. - Let's go. I got this. Oh, never mind. I was just... Damn, this is nice. We gotta meet some friends around here. Oh, no, no, no. Bone Thugs-N-Harmony and Kim Kardashian. Not in my neighborhood. 911. The janitor speaking. Yeah, I'd like to report a suspicious black family in my gated community. Give me your address... They're just walking down the street. Free for everyone to see. They probably have weapons of mass destruction. The little one looks like an evil overlord. Can you please send someone, please? Hello? Hello! Babe, let's just go back to the house. They don't wanna walk. Come on, let's enjoy this. We in Beverly Hills. Look how nice this neighborhood is. Smell the fresh air. It's nice, right? - Oh, man, damn. - This is dumb. Don't try to take my side either, okay... because I still don't know you like that. Hey, hey, hey, watch your mouth now. Daddy, that's not my mother. I don't have to listen to her. My mother died, okay? That's just your wife. - Okay, now... - That's just a side chick that made it. You're gonna respect your elders now. - Happy Purge, neighbor. - The fuck? Baby, he's got a gun. - Can I please go back in the house, Dad? - I'ma pop them legs now. - Relax. - What? That's why I got the switch. - Welcome, Blacks! - Hey, hey, hey! - Why you yelling? - Oh, you must excuse him. He gets so excited when we get to meet new people. Especially different people. So welcome to our beautiful neighborhood. - I am Jim Smith and... - That makes me Mary Smith. And we are... the Smiths. - We come bearing gifts. - I'll take that. - You eat this? - Yeah. It's little goodies from Williams and Sonoma. - So it's food. - Never mind him. - He's a little... - Yeah, special needs. Oh, I get it. She's got a brother that's got special needs, too. It's okay, little fella. - That's a nice little guy. - What the fuck? Why are you rubbing him like a yorkie terrier? He is such a stinker. It's true, I am. I did not get your names. - You are...? - I'm Lorena. - Lorena. Latina? - Yes. - Un nombre bonito. - Mucho gracias. Okay, that's a fucking 'nough, Bill. - Come on, man, what are you doing? - Stop flirting, you. All that neato Telemundo shit. Why would you want that when you can have this? Sweetie, you know I can't resist a beautiful face. - Thank you. - You better put a leash on his ass. And you are? My name is Carl Black. Don't Hate Wiring. You've probably seen, you know, yeah. But I also own a new company now. It's called Mandingo Plumbing... 'cause I lay pipe. - Carl. Carl, stop. - I'd like to lay some on your fat ass. - And I come right after it. - Oh, my God, I'm so embarrassed. - Okay. - And look at this. Are you a little black vampire? - Stop it. - It's a little ironic... that your name is Black... - because you are-- - Don't say it, bitch. - Carl! - No, she know what she's doing. You moved into the house... at the end of Cherry Blossom, is that right? - Yeah, yeah. - Yeah. Yeah, I'll bet you got a deal on that one. I did-- oh, we did get a good deal in it, yes. - Why? - Well... Let's just say the last owners... left in a little bit of a hurry, mid-renovation. What the fuck is mid-renovation? They didn't survive the Purge. But, you know, I'm sure... That's the first warning. - Yes. - Happy Purge, neighbors. Happy Purge! Okay, well... here's dinner. - What is that? - It's chicken. What, you've never seen chicken, Allie? - Are you sure? - The kitchen is brand-new. There's all those knobs, and I didn't really know how to put the... I understand. It looks good. Yeah, it looks like a vampire chicken... after the sun comes out. That better be the sound for the club. What's with this Purge bullshit, all right? Oh, my God, Dad. You don't pay attention to anything. Tonight's only the most dangerous night all year. Yeah, people can get away with robbing, murdering... whatever crime they want for 12 hours. And the police can't do anything about it. Okay, look. Enough with this Purge shit, all right? It's a damn joke. People don't purge in no damn neighborhood like this. Shit, man, I just got out of prison... and here you go with this fuckin' shit. I didn't come out for this shit. I'm too old for this shit, man. - Shit. - Maybe it was just down the street. Maybe we should board up the windows or something. - Yeah. - Blacula. Are you scared? I thought you was the night of the walking dead. I'm the living dead. The walking dead are zombies. I think Carl's Jr.'s right. We need to batten down the hatches. - You know what I'm saying? - No, no, no, listen, guys. I moved you guys to the safest zip code in the country, all right? They don't purge in neighborhoods like this. Back in Chicago, we couldn't even look out the windows, remember? But at least we knew who was coming for us. Now, we're safe. This is protection. This is first class living right here, all right? We don't have to worry about all that crazy stuff. Oh, shit, I'd rather be in jail getting fucked. Fuck this shit. I ain't with this. They're ready to kill all the blacks. They are purging for blacks! - They want the niggas! - Shut up! Carl, we need to get everybody in the car right now... and drive out of this crazy neighborhood right now! Listen, listen, listen. Listen, everybody. Listen, all right? Now, we're gonna go to the panic room. Relax. It's the purge... but it ain't for us, okay? - Okay. - All right, come on, let's go. Let's move. Let's go. I thought we weren't allowed to go out there! We gotta go! Thanks. Does asbestos smell like weed? 'Cause if so, I smell it. Shut up. Nothing. You see anything?

I heard you. - Let's go. - CJ, come on. Hello, Carl. Or should I call you Mr. Black? How do you know my name? We know how you can afford... to live in this neighborhood... - and you're not welcome. - You've been Googling my ass? You're not wanted here, Carl. We enjoy watching your kind on the football field... the basketball courts, and the boxing ring. But we pay for cable TV... to see you on our television... not to live in our neighborhood. Daddy, I'm scared. It's a matter of time... before your wife starts to braid hair... like Allen lverson! Why does he still have the braids? We like Allen lverson's braids. - Yeah. - We do. Mr. Black... it's a matter of time... before our wives want to sleep with you. And I do not want you destroying my wife's guts. So I must destroy you. You think I'm scared of you? We don't want a nigga. - What? - What? You out of your mind? - Too much? - Yeah! - What the hell are you thinking? - Way too much. Sorry about that, Carl. Nah, fuck all that. No, no, don't be sorry.

I'm going to cut the power now, Mr. Black. So it's going to be harder to see you and your family. Maybe if you smile... it would help us find you in the dark. Fuck. Fuck. Jesus. My power tool has run out of gas. What are the chances? I'll be back, Mr. Black. Why is my power tool out of gas? The Purge is the same time every year, you two imbeciles. - I'm scared of the dark. - What? How are you a vampire and scared of the dark? Vampires are scared of the dark sometimes. It's just a little thing that goes on. Don't worry about it. We're on lockdown. They can't do nothing to us. They killed the power. UP With y'all? What the hell? Where'd you come from? - I came through the back. - The back? What the hell you mean you came through the back? - We on lockdown! - Clearly, we're not. Man, you got a lot of broke windows out there in the back. You need to get that shit checked. You ain't check that shit on Zillow before you bought this shit? Look, if that window's open... who knows what else is open. You go check out the front... and I'ma go check out the back. Wait, wait, wait, black people don't split up. - Yeah. - We gotta split up tonight. Girls, y'all stay here. Come on, let's do it. All right, guys, listen... we're gonna be fine as long as we stay together. I can't take this anymore. I have to go. - Carl's Jr! - God! The Purge is on, motherfuckers! - Who's there? - Welcome to the neighborhood, Blacks! Hey, hey! They're upstairs! It's gonna be okay. Dark is just the opposite of light. I don't play that shit.

Okay? H's a purge going on... and we don't need this. We're trying to stick together. Why come you can't come with us, man? You look like Vanessa Williams, bro. I know, man. I sat in this motherfucking car... and I've been thinking like, "Why am I not a the house? - Why am I not in a house?" - You're a nice guy, man. I started doing all the math, and I thought about it. It's 'cause motherfuckers like you don't pay shit. Therefore, I can't buy no house like this. I gotta always chase a motherfucker down... and tonight, on Purge night of all nights... they give me the slip? Me? All the white motherfuckers... that work there, and they gave it to the mixed nigga? Why? 'Cause they thought I might almost kill your ass. But tonight, I'll do it, motherfucker. I got a couple hours left, and I will shoot you in your motherfucking face. They killed my grandparents tonight, man. They made them kill each other with plastic spoons. They made them kill each other with plastic spoons! - Get out. - All right. Get out slowly. -L'ma pay with your ass in a minute. - Can I get out this way?

Pay your bills, I wouldn't be here, man! God damn it, don't you try nothing. I hate to do this to you, man. Looked like you were capable of paying them notes. Looked like you could've did if you believed in yourself. Could still see your ass in the rearview. Don't try no slick shit. 'Cause don't you try shit. Don't you try shit. What's that noise? Shit, I got balls. I got balls, homie! I got balls, homie. Yeah,boom! Yeah. Just like Paris Hilton did back in the day. Turn it, turn it. I know the dance move. I know the dance move.

Mary! - Hey, Larry. - Larry. - What are you guys doing here? - Happy Purge. Yeah, you guys brought the guns and the vests... and the bullets, the shot-- That's a good look on you, Mary. Just don't give me them bedroom eyes... or I'm gonna have to purge Jim. I'm just fucking with you. Hey, that thing got a laser on it? Yeah! Mary got this online for me at the pre-Purge sale. - Thank you, baby. - Thank you. Larry, here's the thing. You're the worst president... this Home Owner's Association's ever had. It was you who filled out that application... - and accepted it, right? - What? I didn't know they were a black family. How can you not know that? Did you see their car? Did you see their rims? I was doing the paperwork. I looked down, I just saw "Blacks" Thought it was, like Jack Black. We're gonna have to go back to a two-term limit. - Larry, it's disappointing, man. - Absolutely. You guys are so sensitive. Tell you what. I'ma cut Carl up. - You guys get the rest of the family. - Carl, no! - We can do that. - Yeah. Let's purge. We're gonna do a black family... whose name's Black. It's twofer. - Hey, Carl. - No, no. Come on, come on. Shot me in the back! I'm gonna need a wine cooler and you. I thought we were friends. Jim and Mary, thank you so much. Thank you. - You're welcome. - Hello, Blacks. - Hey! - Just got one more thing for you. - What? - What? As the... I guess I'm the new president of the Home Owner's Association. Let me just say you have no business in this neighborhood. - Excuse me? - Once a hood rat... Hey, hey, hey, hey! ...always a hood rat. You're the guys that brought us a gift basket. Yeah, we did. We give them to everybody. I told you they don't like black folks in this neighborhood, man. And now we're gonna serve you up your eviction notice, brother. Damn! They are killing like shit around here! Jorge... neighborhood watch, saves the day. - Not again. Come on. - No, it's Jorge. Baby, look, I told you my people are good. Gracias, Jorge. Gracias. Besito, mi amor. Well, I couldn't let them have all the fun. Oh, God! - Dang it! - Hold up, man. It's 7:01. - The Purge is over. - Yeah, the Purge is over. I don't give a shit what time it is. For me, there's only one time. - Oh, man! Just... - And it's time to take out the Blacks. Okay, now, listen, man... enough is enough. - You're gonna kill us? - Fuck it. Let me pray with my family. Do what you gotta do... and when you're down there, take care of me. I'll wait. Come on. Let me pray with my family. Everybody get over here. Dear heavenly Father... Motherfucker! Oh, shit! Stay back, stay back, stay back. He might not be dead. - No, he dead. - He's dead? He's gone. You did it! - Daddy. - Babe. My family, I love y'all. I know I done made a whole lot of mistakes in my life... but if there's one thing we learned today... it's that we all love each other... and we stick with each other, okay? And, Allie, I'm proud of you. But I want you to leave guys like Mr. Freezee alone. You're a real woman. You need something better than that. - All right, Dad. - Junior... you can be anything you want in life. - Just don't be like your daddy. - Thanks, Dad. And, baby, I love you. I love you, baby. Thank you. - I'm over here. - Cronut. - What's up, boy? - I need my money from you, man. I got you. I'm gonna go get it right now. But you ain't got nothing positive about me? I like how you blew Sinbad up in that damn. I told you, man, it's gonna work. You gotta put more trust in your boy. I just ain't get the settlement, but you're good. - You got your bread. - Yeah, well, go get it. I'm gonna get-- All right, I got it. Don't purge yOur DOY- Yeah, man, I'm-- You know, Daddy made a whole lot of mistakes... but there's one thing about me. I love my family. - I love us, too. - Love you, baby. We gotta pack our shit up and get the fuck out of Beverly Hills. - Yeah, let's go. - I'm with you. Black family! Boom, selfie! Nigga, we made it. So we survived the night... and I learned some valuable lessons. Always handle your business the right way... 'cause fools be trippin'. Never deal with racist homeowners. And the most important lesson... nothing is more important than family. I'm still alive, nigga. Winter's coming. This is it. Our new home. This is our own cabin. - It's gonna be great. - There it is. New beginnings. - It's so beautiful. - It is, right? We can make s'mores and stuff like white people. - It's gonna be fun. - I'm bringing all my bitches here, too. Shut up. - It's gonna be great. - Carl Black done escaped the Purge? We beat the Purge. Black family! Jason Voorhees? L'ma drop a dime on Jason Voorhees. I don't like that shit.
