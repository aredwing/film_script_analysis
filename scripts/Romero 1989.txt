It happened in the elections... when the winner gets detention. - Send in reinforcements. And now in 1977 ... and this time, we will not stand for it anymore. We will occupy this Plaza ... until there is a True Election ... A Free Election. Freedom, Freedom, Freedom ... Those who had just voted, Please come to the back of bus. Thank you. Alfonso, take care of these two. They have not voted. Let's go. Everybody get in line to vote. Good morning. Hey, Hernando. Listen ... Take the bus to El Paisnal and bring them to San Martin, there are more than 100 voters waiting for you. Hurry, for Christ's sake. Come. Look at them. I cursed the rain ... I cursed the dirt. But after the land was saved... I don't know, why I loved it too. It was ours. But now ... They come and says, We had to go. We were only share croppers who had no rights. When we refused to go ... They burned our homes. We were left with nothing. - It is God's will. - Who says it is God's will? I think God look at these things and vomits.. What is the matter? Oscar? What are you thinking? What are you doing? I am not doing anything. It's the pople that are doing ... At last. Archbishop Chavez says You are going too fast. What did you think? I have always believed in you ... in your strength, your ideals. But some even say you ... are subversive ... an agitator. Remember who else they call such names? Jesus is not somewhere up in the clouds ... lying in a hammock. Jesus is down here with us ... building his kingdom. Oscar, what else can I do? I cannot love God whom I do not see ... if I do not love my Brothers and Sisters ... whom I can see. "Father Grande" They are stopping buses on the road. - The Voters can't get through. - Where? On the road from El Paisnal. It's Okay now. Everybody up We must have to get to Aguilares to vote. Tell that to the guerrillas, they wants to sabotage the elections. The road is closed. Good afternoon, Lieutenant. These people want to get to the polls. There are snipers shooting at anything that moves. The polls close in three hours. I'm Sorry, but ... I cannot jeopardize the safety of all these people. They say the road is too dangerous. - We'll take the risk. These buses are not going any place. The Lieutenant will not let us drive to Aguilares... So... Shall we walk? Yes, Father. Off course, We'll walk. Come on, Lieutenant, you can protect us. You don't need me. No terrorist would dare to shoot at the Church. I'll see the jeep get's back, Monsignor. Take a little walk. Martnez. Keep moving. Come on. Let them try killing these people ... first they have to kill us. We walk under the protection of our Lord. Jesus was vulnerable. Don't think that we're not. Then what shall we be, Cowards? Not cowards but not heroes either. Just ordinary people trying to do a job. So are the soldiers. You know? I think, pretty soon ... they won't allow the Bible into our country any more. All we get is bindings ... because everything inside on the pages would be declared revolutionary. Tilia, you should be the one taking the Archbishop Chavez's place. I'm not even a Bishop. But you can talk, you know the people. We need someone who can change things before it's too late. Rivera y Damas is a good man. The worst would be Romero. Not even the Vatican is that crazy. He fiddles the violin while El Salvador burns. We won't let El Salvador burn. Come in. - Oscar. - Hi, My Lord Monsignor. Are you alright? I'm fine. I'm just tired. It's been a difficult day. I have some news for you. Please sit down, Monsignor.. I feel you may need to sit down. You have been appointed Archbishop. I am not qualified. The Vatican has great confidence and I will support you. Others won't. It's not an easy time. What should I do? What God wants. What is that? He is a good compromise choice. He'll make no waves. He's a bookworm. The whole country would be running wild and he would not even notice it. The military would keep a lid on things. They may need to. And you'd get an another medal. Perhaps... Anyway, his health is delicate, always has been. He won't last. Yes, Give him a happy death soon. I come from a world of books. and There is much to learn in their pages. But I have much else to learn. There is ferment and division ... alive in our land. Certain priests accept ... and express the most radical ideas glibly. But none of us can pretend to know all the answers and demand ... that others implement them. We in the Church, must keep to the centre, watchfully ... in the traditional way ... but seeking justice. Monsignor ... May I present, The President-elect and his wife. Best Wishes, Monsignor. - We seems to share victories. - Yes We hope more than that. We must work closely, together. Yes, General. Thank you. Monsignor Monsignor This is for you, With the Best Wishes of our family. Thank you. And we have a houuse in Escalon to. It would be our privilege to offer it to you ... as a home I say a quiet place to get away. I hope you will baptize our daughters new baby, Monsignor. it would be my privilege. Monsignor. We had to bring you a little something to... for all your books. It's very beautiful. After the reception, You must come and have a quite lunch with us ... Just the three of us. Will you Excuse me for a moment please. It's Good to see you. It's not so much, when compared to ... but I also brought you something. This is what I really needed. - You like them? - Yeah, Okay Everybody knows you're coming. Here comes the Archbishop. The body of Christ. Freedom - Freedom - Freedom ... You have five minutes to disperse. The Commander in Chief of El Salvador As ordered everyone, to leave the Plaza. You have five minutes to disperse. We order you to disperse. We order you to disperse. Stop it. Stop it. Ah, Lieutenant ... You see, Signs are everywhere -- Unions, Cooperative Societies ... Student Organizations. Everywhere. Too many people do not realize, the high risks involved. The Basic freedoms, We take for granted ... Our whole way of life. And no government can put a stop to it alone. Believe me. Ricardo, This not one of your business meeting ... - This is a party. - We're coming now. We were just looking at the house. Natalia is feeling very uncomfortable here. Doesn't know anyone here. She knows me. - I like her. - So do I. So she is the one, you marry? I doubt it. Monsignor, I like you to meet, Ricardo Columa. My warmest Congratulations, Monsignor. Thank you. Who is that? I don't know how to say this about. About an hour ago while I was giving Holy Communion ... With Fathers Osuna and Morantes ... and suddenly the National Guard arrived. And now there are, perhaps ... dead. - I'll go at once. - It's too late. Don't you see what is going on around here? Anyone who says what he thinks ... about land reforms, or wages, or God or human rights ... automatically he is labled a communist. He lives in fear ... they take him away, they torture him, they kill him. You don't believe me, right? Goodbye, Oscar. Where are you going? Back to A Aguilares ... to be with my people ... to serve them, to work with them, to strengthen them, While they are still alive. This is not the way God wants his children to live... It cries out to heaven for redress. Therefore, even at the risk of being misunderstood ... or persecuted, The Church must lift it's voice in protest ... when a society is so permeated with injustice. `` - What does you all think? - It's inflammatory. The people would take to the streets. But there is nothing but truth in the statement ... and it must be said. I believe it should read at all the Masses, this Sunday. I'm not sure. You asked for the statement, Monsignor. I know. Now you want to give it up? No. .. just tone down. It musn't be incendiary. That's it. That's right An amicable solution. Archbishop and Monsignor Cordoba ... will amend the Statement. In Favour? Against? Approved. Fernando, I baptize you in the name of the Father ... the Son, and the Holy Spirit. Luis... I baptize you in the name Father ... Son, and the Holy Spirit. Fernado, Can I give you a lift? Put on my hat. The sun is very very hot today. Alright, Let's go. Let's go. Oh, My God. Get Down, Get Down. You, Get out. Come on, Let's Go. Get out of here. You Get out of here. You are very very sick. Very Very sick. You must rest ... and we will treat you and try to save you. We will treat you try to save you. When am I going to die? You're temperature is a 1012. Very sick. Let me see. that sounds a little high. degrees. Monsignor ... it is for you. Excuse me, Doctors. Yes? I would give the harmony. No. The Archbishop must. The Archbishop should speak. He is here. His presence is enough. This is time when he should speak. Excuse me, Fathers ... I'm looking for my boy. I'm looking for my Rutilio. I must ... take him home to his mother ... to wash him and stay with him. Yes Then afterwards, I would like you to permit us... to take him to the cathedral. I want them to lie together, for all to see. This Sunday, there will be not be a Mass in Aguilares or in Paisnal ... nor in Santiago. There will be a single mass in the cathedral. And it will be ... for a... fine priest ... an old man ... and the boy. They are equal, and they are us. They were murdered, and we must not let this happen again. You cannot do that, force everyone to go to the same mass. It's never been done before. Priests have not been assassinated before. The Church's job is to preach the Gospel. This is going to be interrupted as a political statement. I'm not trying to make a political statement. I want to draw the people together ... to mourn these deaths and to express their outrage. The Church has always been a stabilizing influence. If we abandon this role now? What will happen? Are you all against it? - Yes - Yes I defer to your authority. And you, Monsignor? I don't know. Not everybody could come. Not everybody would. There is no majority ... ... depriving people of the Sacraments ... We have to vote again ... May I help you? When I was looking for Monsignor Rivera y Damas ... he is busy. Is it a matter of confession? No, not exactly. Not really. How can I confess what I did not do? Please. What then? Maybe you can help me. How could I possibly do that? Everyone else is giving me advice ... - I would like yours. - Mine? You know about Father Grande. Yes What do you think I should do? Will I go to Heaven when I die? It's so bad here. Someone has to take his stand. I would got to have something to look forward too If this were an ordinary funeral ... I speak of my friendship with Father Grande. At crucial moments in my life, he was always there... close to me ... and those times will never be forgotten. But this is a moment ... to gather from these deaths a message ... for all of us who remain on pilgrimage. The liberation that Father Grande preached ... was a liberation rooted in faith. And because it is so often misunderstood... for it Father Rutilio Grande died. Who knows? Perhaps the murderers are listening to these words. So, we want to tell you ... murderers brethren ... that we love you ... and that we ask, for repentance in your hearts. This is my wife Maria on our wedding anniversary. This is our house. These are our children. This one is Paco ... my son. See his face? Always into trouble, and always good. Did you know, my boy ... the soldiers came and took him... and now we can't find him. He has disappeared. We tried to find him. We went to the police. We tried everything, but we can't find out nothing. He has disappeared. Rafael always calls me before he leaves the office. Today, He didn't call me... Why Rafael? He works beside his men in the fields. He the Minister of Agriculture, but he supports the agrarian reform. We have some money, but we had nothing to do with political prisoners. - Have you told the police? - You read the ransom demand. Have you told your father? I'm afraid of what he might do. I called you ... you're our friend ... and because you can help us. Can't you? Please help me. Good morning, Fathers. Good morning. Monsignor, What brings you here? I need to ask your help. Rafael Celada has been kidnapped. Do either of you have a way to find out, who would have taken him? I can't help you, Father. Father Osuna? I can't either You can't ... or you won't? Here's your car, Monsignor. Hello, Monsignor. How can I help you? It can be dangerous to be on the streets of El Salvador. I am trying to find the way to get Rafael Celada released. - why should I want that? - Money was demanded. The money is just icing on the cake. The real issue is political prisoners. Free them, and you find Celada freed. Think of the family and what they're going through. If I did, he wouldn't be alive. One must find other ways to work these things out. Excuse me, Monsignor. I grow tired of this conversation. We'll let you off. And take a look and see what it is like ... how our people are forced to live. Monsignor. - Good morning. - Good morning, Monsignor. I have an appointment with the President-elect. Yes, Monsignor. I'm sorry, Monsignor, but it's a pity -- The president-elect has been detained. I will wait. The president-elect express his sincere regrets ... but he would have you, to call you on your schedule appointment at the earliest opportunity. I will wait. It maybe hours. He's coming back? Yes Give him this. Monsignor ... Monsignor? I'm afraid that President-elect has not returned. But he sent you this note. Good night, Monsignor. Good night. NO POLITICAL PRISONERS. Done what they said ... exactly as they told me, Hours, and Hours ago and nowhere. Waiting and waiting and nowhere. I don't know. There is nothing to do. And we're waiting. What else can we do? There must be something else we could do. There should be words soon. Soon? `` How soon is soon ``? I'm Sorry. I'm glad you're here with me. Of course I am here. I heard things, Monsignor. What things? That you are sympathetic only to the poor. Not only to the poor. To radicals? I must minister to everyone. To the men who have taken Rafael? You're brave ... But how could you think that I wouldn't find out? Why didn't you tell me? This is my doing, Father. We have done what they have asked. We've saved him ... Haven't you? He's going to be all right, Isn't he? They asked for political prisoners. Perhaps you -- I could not do such thing. If they harm him ... it will be our turn. Then there will be blood. That can't help. You're religious people ... You live in your souls. You do not understand what we do ... producing, selling, bringing dollars in... Capital, to develop the country, to create jobs ... to build a prosperous economy. What's this have to do with Rafael? That is what affects people. But for that we must have law and order. These priest of yours ... whith all their talk about justice and human rights ... organizing these people convincing them that they are God Almighty ... They are responsible for these problems. And so you, Monsignor. However ... the Church is a whore. she would spread her legs to the highest bidder. Bring him. Bring him home. You are a part of this. Monsignor? We're here to see Father Alfonso Osuna. Who? He's not here. I am Father Villez ... and I would like to see Father Osuna. Father Villez is the Jesuit Provincial ... I am the Archbishop Romero. and we would like to see the Father. Could we have a moment alone, please? What happened? I was preparing to celebrate the Eucharist ... when they came, they blindfolded me and brought me here. Why? They said that I was responsible for Zelada's death. They said that I was in collusion with the guerrillas. How could they? I do know some of them. But you're not? You met one of the guerrilla, Monsignor. Does that make you one? Because Zelada died, Is it my fault? Is it yours ... What did they do? They used electricity. I'm just glad that I am a priest and celibate ... because I don't think I would have a choice ... no longer. Monsignor ... What are you doing here? We are here to get Father Osuna. Who let you in? Why was this man brought here? He cannot be released. Do not have the authority to release him. Who have the authority to arrest him? I was carrying out instructions. Instructions to torture him? Monsignor, He's in a meeting ... Please Monsignor... The Swedish ambassador will be at the embassy. - I want them ... - Good afternoon. Monsignor How are you? - I am Fine. - Good to see you. Come in. May I offer you a drink? - No thank you. - Sit down, please. Now ... What can I do for you? I am sorry to come to you like this, General but ... this is a matter of importance. Few weeks ago Father Grande was assassinated. Yesterday, a priest was tortured. Today, I preceded at the funeral Mass. for the Minister of Agriculture Zelada. This violence is destroying us. There is trouble on many sides, Monsignor. Even inside the Church, elements had gone astray. The priests must be without the politics. But there are political implications to the Gospel. We will take care of those. Now, In a week I would be inaugurated. The Archbishop has always attended ... to symbolize the Church's blessing. We have not heard from you, Monsignor. It would be of great help to all of us ... if you would be present. How can I bless a situation ... in which innocent people are disappearing night after night? Unfortunately ... I found it necessary to occupy Aguilares... and to close the church until there is order again. You can't do that. It is a tragedy. But let's face it. This Grande ... We know what they are doing out there. We have proof. Inciting the people, agitating ... calling political meetings ... On the day you became Archbishop ... on the day he was killed. He was a Communist. Father Grande was here with me ... on the day I became Archbishop. And the day he was killed, it was baptisms he was performing . You are a liar. You cannot count on my support, I will attend the inaugration. That is going to be a magnificent ceremony. I am the military vicar, and it is my function to go. Who else? I will go. This is not an action that I wish to take or take lightly ... but we musn't do anything to give the impression ... we approve of what is going on. Ther is no Persecuted Church. Don't you see what is going on out there? They are only sons of the Church who have lost their way ... and put themselves outside of the law. Gentlemen, please. I won't go. Monsignor Flores ...? I would like to support the Archbishop ... but I don't agree with him. Infact I seldom do. Infact I think he's become a Jesuit dupe. Accept ... priests are getting killed. Accept I could get killed. Accept it is reprehensible. So ... I am not going. This is a scandal. This divisions ... ever since you became Archbishop, Monsignor. Rome is going to be very unhappy. What are you doing there? What are you doing? Let us go. We are here to remove the Blessed Sacrament ... because the town is occupied. - This is a barracks. - This is a church. What are you doing here? We are here to take care of the Eucharist. Now, Get out of here. Now. Hey ... Hey ... Hey. You again? Stand up. Move. Get out. All right? We are here today ... to retake the possesion of this church building ... and to srengthen all those whom ... the enemies of the church have trampled down. You should know that you have not suffered alone. For you are the Church. You are the people of God. You are Jesus ... in the here and now. He is crucified in you ... just as surely as he was crucified on that hill outside of Jerusalem. And you should know ... that your pain and your suffering ... like His, would contribute to El Salvador's Liberation and Redemption. We'll play then. Arista... You could have come to my office? I did, but there were so many people. Oh, This can be a bit of crazy house. I hope it is a sanctuary. It's time to baptize my baby. It's past time. It would be my privilege. I would like to pick a date. There are Baptisms every Sunday, the choice is yours. I think the first Sunday in December, would be fine. That's a good week. not so crowded. I would like a private baptism. We have so many to baptize now ... we don't have private ones anymore. Will You ... You will make an exception, Monsignor? I am Sorry. You except me to baptize my baby with a bunch of Indians? You have deserted us? God bless you. Bless me, Father, For I have sinned. It as been a month since my last confession. Yes? I am a believer in the theology of liberation ... and I have worked in the people's struggle. That is no sin. No? But I have belief in one single man ... and no one else. That is no sin. Especially in the Archbishop. I deplored him ... and... I laughed at him. How could I tell him ... I was wrong. Just Pray for him. Let that be your penance. I absolve you ... in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit. Amen. Thank you, Father. Thank you, Father. I am a shepherd who ... along with his people, has begun to learn ... a beautiful and difficult truth. Our faith requires that we immerse ourselves in the world. I believe economic injustice ... is the root cause of our problems. From it stems all the violence. The Church has to be incarnated ... in those who fight for freedom ... and defend them ... and share in their persecution. Did you wish to see me, Colonel? I am disturbed by recent events, Monsignor. BE A PATRIO KILL A PRIEST. May I speak to you with all the respect. Problems that exist has not been resolved ... and you're endangering the situation. You are losing the people. Who are those who come to see me at the hospital, who come to my office ... who fill the Cathedral? You are losing the people whose support ... you need to run the country. My task is not to run the country. My task is to prevent my priests and our people from getting killed. Please ... Monsignor have patience. Step back. Wait. If you stop for a while, I'll talk ... Things will cool off ... settle down. It is your choice. This past week ... I wrote a letter to the President of the United States ... not to send any more arms to this country. They are only been used to kill our people. Kneel. They were demonstrating, entering into the church. As been shooting until they have a hostage. They asked for you. Who is in charge? Where do you think, You're going? Inside. They asked for me. No, you're not. I'm going to get the hostage out. He's already dead. Are you sure? We heard noises, Monsignor. Screams. They tortured him. If I get the hostage out, and he's all right ... Will you let the men who hold him, go? No. If I get him out, and the men in their laid down their arms ... Will you let them go? No. What more do you want? If they lay down their arms ... if he is alive, unharmed ... and that if you are still alive. -- Do I have your word? - What did I just say? You, Fathers? Yes, Monsignor. Is the hostage all right? Yes They are holding no one else? They were only holding him only for their own protection. What do they want? A new government. This one is no different from the last. The powerful are still allowed to organize ... and when the poor attempt it ... they hire off duty soldiers to kill them. This is no solution. Don't you realize what's going on? Last night they killed Lucia. And before they raped and killed her ... they cut out her tongue. Somebody has to have the courage to say "Enough". If the hostage is not released in five minutes ... we will storm the church. Tell them to let the hostage go. Show the National Guard He's alive. Have them to put down their weapons. If they do, they agreed to let them go ... Guaranteed safe passage. And you believe them? They gave me their word. You have mine. The hostage is alive and safe. These people have kept their part of the bargain. Who gave you the authority to go in there? - They asked for me. - Who gave you the authority? I told you they asked for me, And this man and I... This man? I am in charge here. - The hostage is safe, this man promised ... - Arrest them. They were guaranteed safe passage. - Who says? - He did, I did. These people are all terrorists. We do not tolerate them. This man gave me his word. Arrest him too. Arnulfo, Cigarette? Stop. Stop, In the name of God. Stop. We are Human Beings. We are Human Beings... We are Human Beings. Monsignor ... Obviously there has been some mistake. I will get you out of here in no time. You're all right? You must take care of yourself. I worry for your safety. You do not fear for your life? You should. Yes .. like any other Salvadoran. I cannot protect you anymore. What if you die? What would happen? I am not leaving here without Father Osuna and the others. Are you ready? Are you ready now to accept, the way it really is? You are a priest. You believe in God and the power of love. You used to pray. I still do. Then why are you carrying a gun? How can I not carry one? Am I going to abandon my people when I am one of those... responsible for opening their eyes? A Guerrilla ... Is that what you are? A Communist? I am a priest ... who sees Marxists and Christians ... struggling to liberate the same people. Jesus is part of that struggle. He will not stand by and watch his people being murdered. So you become like the military and the aristocracy. You wage class warfare, you become violent. How could we continue to speak against violence ... when they are killing the people that we love? Even you admit that we have the right to defend ourselves. You're not defending. You're attacking. And you lose God, just as they have. What else can we do? You think I want this, to live like this? With what you say there will be no end to the bloodshed. I have no choice. I can't ... You must ... I am yours. Show me the way. Look, a priest. Bring him over here. Monsignor ... Search him. Nothing here. Maybe he's got something underneath. Let's see. Take his clothes off. I have nothing. Strip him. Please, okay. It's all right, It's all right But you are our voice ... you speak for us. Let's begin the celebration of the mass now. In the name of the Father and of the Son ... and the Holy Spirit. Amen. With the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ and the love of God ... in the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all. And the Lord be with you. Lord, you created us for freedom ... Lord, have mercy. Christ you made us us to live in dignity ... Christ, have mercy. Lord, you strengthen us, in this struggle for justice ... Lord, have mercy. We developed our country. We penetrated its jungle, planted coffee, sugar cane. We are like the pioneers of the United States. We do not want, what doesn't belong to us. We only want to have what North Americans have ... to live as they do. The mission of the Church ... is to identify itself with the poor ... and to join with them in their struggle for justice. By so doing, the Church finds it's own salvation. The new government is riddled with communists. The Priests are working with the guerrillas. All the unions are infiltrated. Never feel guilty for having fought these subversive. They have declared war on our way of life. Those who fight them, they will be national heroes. I hope that this call of the Church ... does not further harden the hearts of the rich and the powerful ... but will move them to conversion. You are the principle protagonist in this hour of change. On you depends in great part ... the end of violence. There is no clinging to our feudal past. This is a new age... an age in which all God's children... may live in peace, freedom and dignity. I like to make an appeal in a special way ... to the men in the army. Brothers ... each one of you is one of us.. We are the same people. The farmers and peasants that you killed ... are your own brothers and sisters. When you hear the words of a man ... telling you to kill ... Think instead in the words of God. "Thou shall not kill". No soldier is obliged to obey an order ... contrary to the law of God. In His name... and in the name of our tormented people ... who had suffered so much ... and whose laments cry out to heaven... I implore you ... I beg you ... I order you ... Stop the repression. Archbishop Romero was murdered March 24, 1980. He had spoken the disturbing truth. Many chose not to listen. As a result, between 1980 and 1989,... more than 60,000 Salvadorans were killed. But the struggle for peace and freedom,... justice and dignity goes on. I often been threatened with death. If they kill me ... I shall rise in the Salvadoran people. Let my blood be a seed of freedom ... in the sign that, hope will soon be reality. A Bishop will die ... but the Church of God ... which is the people ... will never perish. Subtitle by George M.
