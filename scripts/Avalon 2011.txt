Okay, let's say like this: Welcome to Avalon, our special guests! - Cheers! - Cheers! My baby brother Janne's back where he started! Can you say "Laholmsbukten"? - It'll be like a boarding school. - A boarding school...? Yes, for adults. With seminars, leadership development, coaching... How boring! Why do they always have to make fun things boring? - Are you coming? - We'll meet you at the car. Tommy, you know you can't smoke in the kitchen! - Damn it, I need that delivery! - I told you, it's coming! Coming?! How can I be ready by Friday? There's too much to do! You two have obviously worked together before. Then we'll need some backup! I can't let the health inspectors find you smoking in here! They can eat my ass! This kitchen's closed! Cut the crap and get me my supplies! You're coming to Mallorca with me! You can't stay here. It's totally crazy! - Sometimes you have to make cuts. - Hah hah hah hah! And the results? Lousy! Think of your guests! Sweet dreams! Try to at least get to bed! - To hell with it! - Aren't you in a great mood! How'd you like standing in this damned kitchen for twelve, thirteen hours? Do you miss all this? - No. - I'd like you to stay on a little longer. I could find other things for you to do besides club work. There are jobs galore down here. It's not that. I have to move on. I need time. Okay. You'll get your money. I promised. On Friday at the opening, alright? Now let's drop the subject. A bit more nose there. Sit down, Janne! I can't concentrate with you roaming around like that! Melon? Here! Not in the food... What are you thinking about? Dad?! Nothing. There's a lot to do right now, with the club opening and everything. How's your mom? She's doing great, as always. But then, quite suddenly he had contracts and staff all lined up! So I said to myself: "Okay". So I'm here for the opening. That's how it is. In other words, you're down here for the money. Yes. I suppose so. And then? Gothenburg. Cut it out! Don't be silly! This is quite interesting. But, boy, has it become expensive! "With terrace and sea view" and even a pool... What more could you ask for? Yes, it sounds great. How do you wish to travel, Sir? What would suit you? - Time for me to go. - Why not sleep on the sofa instead? - I have sleeping pills, if you need them. - No. So tonight I thought I'd have you meet the staff to give you an introduction into our activities. It makes it easier if you're someone they know rather than some stranger. They're extremely professional. They are real pros, very competent. - Hi there! - See you on Friday? - Howdy there! - Hi there, Klas! - Nice eh? - Absolutely wonderful! Heavenly! It's fantastic! - Just incredible! - Hi there! "Donatas" is his name? Sounds like an ice cream... He's from Lithuania. What a clever guy! He can do everything. Roofing, masonry, painting, cars... You know... you can't just go through your whole life... letting things happen and hoping that everything will work out. I already told them not to throw them like this... There are no short cuts to success. It's a matter of hard work. You know, you're a real man, Klas. I'm impressed. Cut it out! Stick to the subject instead of acting silly. - Okay, what was the subject? - Your lifestyle. Would you call it "rock'n roll" - or what? I don't know what I call mine. What do you call yours? Good question... Janne, shouldn't I try another color on my nails? Yes. Sure. Such keen interest! Yellow or black? - These are great! - I told you that before! "Hey, baby, care for a drink?" "Klasse, could we wear these for your opening?" "That way Janne and I will recognize one another!" In the crowd. - Janne, who's this Lisbeth? - She's my probation officer. She's my contact person from the non-custodial treatment authorities. She's supposed to rehabilitate people like me. This is Radio Bstad! Party party! Don't miss the opening of the year! Friday June 7, the hottest new night club Avalon is opening its doors! On Merchant Street in Bstad. An unforgettable night you mustn't miss! - Avalon Nightclub! - Where the party... ...never wants to end! Janne, come on! Come on! Please, Janne! Janne! Janne! Janne! Come on, let's go now. Let's go now! Come on! Totally absurd! An hour to get hold of a taxi! So what's happened? Totally crazy! And now a whole hour of your favorite songs! Some old, some new! "96 Days of Summer"! Radio Bstad! The station near you! And the heat wave shows no signs of abating this week. A treat for all you partiers and sun worshippers. 30 degrees at noon today. Record heat maybe, but we haven't exactly been spoiled so far this year. Radio Bstad! "96 Days of Summer"! From on top of Halland Ridge! Summer morning from Radio Bstad! I'll be right back. I need your signature. Will others be coming in here? No, it's booked and reserved for you. Hi there! - Hello there! - Hi, I'm Stefan. - Have you been playing? - I was. He was doing pay and play! If you can call it playing! - Are you a member? - A member? Yes. - Do you play at Bstad? - Yeah. - Are you a member? - No, I'm on the waiting list. It's long. Maybe next year. Well, hang in there, it's worth it. Those are great courses. - Coffee? - No thanks. - See you this weekend, then! - Wouldn't miss it! So what's this all about? You see, the other day Janne was out... driving my car. My red Mustang convertible. He was driving up there on Italian Way. You know where that is... on that hill leading up to Erikstorp. It has all those curves and... There was an accident. He accidentally backed into that scaffolding. It collapsed and he... well, he... yeah, well... Lift him up. Hold him! Up on three... One, two, three. I need to come up. Let's go. There now... Let's just forget this. It was an accident. You have to get rid of all his belongings. Burn all his stuff. Tidy up. And I need to find someone to finish the roof. Come... Are you in trouble? - Did you hurt yourself? - Fuck no! I don't know where the fuck I am! You're in Bstad. Where do you live? Don't touch me! I was just trying to help you! I don't want any help! - Take it easy. - Don't touch me! I said don't touch me! Fuck... - I'd like a little more text. - Okay. People want to know what you were trying to say, what the titles mean... What are you doing these days? Mainly playing bridge. But it's kind of the same thing you work with. Psychodrama! Playing bridge is extremely psychodramatic! We're actors, we look at art! The broad, distinct line... - Where do you see that nowadays? - Not very often. - What do you think of the exhibition? - It's great... Just look: a sun, the sea, meadows, and something flying away! - I want to talk the late 80's with you. - Uh oh! A red cross and something like this. I know just what you're thinking of: my FagerskiaeId, right? - Exactly. - Come with us. I'm coming. I'm coming with you! - But is it yours? - Of course it's mine. Janne! The FagerskiaeId... it's mine, isn't it? - It's at Bjorns, but that's not a problem. - No, no, no! Not for me. I've been meaning to fetch it anyway, so why not now? - You mean this month? - Or even this week. Okay, great. I'm leaving on Saturday, so we'll have to do it before Thursday. - Then let's sign. - We don't need any papers now. What a pleasure to do business with you! Obviously! With all this kissing! Oh no! Stop, stop, stop! - Oh, double sixes! That's good, too. - If you say so. But I feel happy about it. Some people aren't so pretentious. Little things make us happy. Three and two. God, how bloated you've become! - I'm taking back my painting. - Your painting? Yes. It's my painting. I'm just fetching it. Ten years ago it may have been your painting. - How many of my things do you have? - Not one! If you'd just picked up the phone I could've solved this in another way. What's she doing here? Bjorn, what's going on? Would you please silence that little person! Bjorn... - You've gone way too far. - Bjorn, silence that little person. - Please. - No one can go this far. You've gone way too far. - Can't we go? - No. I'm going too far? At least I don't bare it all in the tabloids! You get out of my house! You are so tacky. Did you know that? You're the tackiest person I know. It's inconceivable to me that we've been married to the same man! If anyone understands things here it's you, Janne. - Put down the painting and leave. - No way! It's my FagerskiaeId! - I'm taking it with me! - You're a sad case, Jacqueline! This has gone too far. You two take that painting and get out of here! I think that's an excellent idea! - And I'm taking this as a little souvenir. - The game's over! - I don't even want it! - The game's over! What do you want? Stefan and Becker were just here to deliver the lounge sofas for the VIP corner. They want to be paid already tomorrow. And they want to be paid for their expenses for Donatas. They said they wanted it. I need to find someone to finish the roof in case it starts raining. Did you tidy up? Well, did you? Get rid of all his things and... There was a barbecue, too. - Yes, Klas speaking. - Do you want a vodka soda, too? - Yeah! Not long to go! - We're going to have so much fun! - Yeah. Here you go. What the hell...?! What the hell are you doing? Why did you do that? Damn it, Janne! Why? - I just wanted to cheer everyone up. - We were already feeling cheerful. - Could either of you lend me a towel? - Forget it! You know blbr? Yes, blueberries. Luns... omme? Lingon. Yes. The heat here in Bstad won't be any problem for the players down on center court. Klas, you know that vodka sponsor who backed out? Did you get hold of him? Wait! - Janne! Come down here! - Did you get hold of him? - He didn't answer. - Did you try again? - No, I thought you guys could. We could?! You can't say you'll do something, then not do it wholeheartedly. - Then nothing works here, does it? - Wholeheartedly? - Can't you take care of this for us? - Why can't you do it? Did you tidy up? Yeah, it's fine. Have you been up there? Up there? Oh yeah, it's uh, it's uh... It's almost done. What do you mean? The money? Yes. No - the money? No, you see... Hey, listen... Excuse me... Just a second. The roof tiling. It's done. That's a relief. Okay. Let's talk about this later. We were discussing where to put that bar. I don't have much time. What happened to your Pole, Balt, whatever he is? - Who? - What happened to him? Wasn't your handyman going to help with the bar? Donatas? - He can't. - He was to help out. What's that got to do with the sponsors' furniture? We need help, don't we? Either take it or leave it. You see how the cards are spread. It's not a laughing matter. I'd take it a little more seriously. - This is... Look at the cards at least! - I'm looking at them, for Crissake! And that is the seafront. And here is the sea. You'd love it. I don't know what you're thinking about. - Wine? - No thanks, we're busy with this.. - Did you want to serve me more wine? - Yes, among other things. More wine. Then there are other bars down here along the shore. With all your creativity you could do almost anything. It's beautiful, mild, nice... Anything goes! And everyone's open to new ideas. So go for it! Go down and bathe and you'll feel like a new person. Okay, so you're standing there in the forest shouting and what happened then? Nothing. Nothing? Right... - Something happened to me. - So I see. Donatas' girlfriend showed up the other day. What? Donatas' girlfriend... showed up the other day. She just appeared. I told her that she could stay in the house until Donatas came back. Where is she now? I don't know. She just - ran off. And Donatas' belongings - are they still there? Yes. - Are you crazy! - What's wrong? - Are you crazy?! - What's wrong with you? You'll get your fucking money. Don't worry. Good God! Start all over again. Doing what? Something really stupid. How old are you two anyway? I'm beginning to wonder. Nice. - Cool. - Come try it out. Sit down. - Yeah. - Sit farther back! Make yourself comfy! It's Viro throughout, and there's dralon in all the fabric - the seats, cushions, everything! Let's take a photo! - Janne, come here! You get in the middle! Janne! That's it! - Klasse! - Look straight at the camera! - Great! - Perfect! Now you're in our campaign! What do you say we take care of the payment now, guys? I don't want to sour the party mood tonight. So let's settle up now. What do you say? - You can see the photos now! - Good work, dude! Do you like this one? - Well, if it isn't... - What? I thought you were dead! No! - Hi! I can't believe how much this tennis week has changed. - Yes. - The difference is phenomenal. It's crazy how much they've put into it. You know, two years ago a reporter asked Goran Persson: "Why are you here in Bstad and not in Almedalen?" The former prime minister replied: - "Bstad is the new Almedalen. " - Yes! It's true! If Olof Palme were still alive, he'd be standing right here. - In Bstad, not in Almedalen. - I'm sure you're right. It's a sign of our times, in every respect. Yes! Barnaise, chili barnaise... remoulade... I'm a little curious. I don't think I understand what your role is. - Can you explain it for me? - Yes. I'm your boss. Chili barnaise, please. Janne, there you are! Come join us upstairs! - I need to take care of something. - Do it later. Great music, hot babes, what more could you want? Sit down. So you drive one of those Mini-Coopers? - You got it! - Is that true?! She drives a Mini-Cooper! They're beautiful! So what've you done with your little buddy Klas? He had to go out a while. Oh, those are for me? Yes. They're selling like hotcakes down on the, uh... Riviera. Bought 'em all - the whole concept. I don't want to sour the mood by talking money. But I'm adding a few zeros to your bill. So you'll have to sell a lot of champagne this summer! It feels awesome. Feel it... It feels awesome. It's awesome getting to touch it. That's enough. Cut it out! - Faster, Avalon, Avalon! - Stop it, please! - Avalon! - Please, please...! Come on! You're so difficult! You bastard! Klas! Klas! Calm down! - Take it easy! - The man-the man-the man! Calm down! Tell that guy we need his Hummer, and bring my sister, too! - Are you done now? - That bastard is here. Yes, I ran into him, too. Calm down... I'm going to put you in that car. You're going home, all of you. It's for the best, okay? Take it easy. Calm down. What the hell...? - What the hell... - Just get in the car. Get in. Agnes, get in the car. Get in the car. Wait, wait. I'm sorry. Hi. Are the others inside, or where did they go? Dad... Oh, fuck it.
