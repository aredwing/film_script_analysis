Why didn't you arrest him? -Unarmed? You confiscated my duty weapon at the start of the war. Everything alright? -Just some dirt in my mouth. Remember I could have been talking to your grave right now. Stay here until dark. I can't stand here all that time. I'll see you at home tonight. -I can't stay here that long. Sleep well. -Asshole! Did your cargo arrive alright? -Of course. Except we had problems on the way back. They checked our ID papers. We had them going, didn't we? They were waiting for us. Ladies, if I'll ever need a bath again, I'll know where to go. Better be careful. -Don't go to bed too late, Liza. No, dad. And? How did you go? -Our friend was delivered safely. We only had a problem on the way back. But we solved it. Good, that's English pilot number 7 already. It won't be long now. That's a shame. Our escape route's developed a good reputation. After the war, I'll stay in the industry. I'll be a tour guide. Except, London's just came up with something entirely new. Sabotage. You enjoy the intelligence work, don't you? Don't be difficult. Just make sure I didn't do it for nothing. I think what he said about that train's very important. Shall I cut his throat right away? Don't be an idiot. Hands up! Lie down! Don't move! Rinus, hurry! I'm stuck, damnit. Undo it! Undo it! THE BLACK RIDER He almost ran me over! -It was the Rider! After him, quickly. Go on, go on! Goddamnit! COME UNTO ME ALL YE THAT LABOUR AND ARE HEAVY LADEN DUTCH BUTTER A pleasure that you're working at the border again, Uzerman. You've been gone for too long. -My country called, gentlemen. All the pretty Indonesian girls give their regards. You've had quite some trouble with your colonies. And you lost them too. At least, we still have our Congo. And no problems at all. But I understand you have plenty of problems at the border. The situation has become worse over the past couple of years. They're crossing the border with their butter as if we're not there. And, to be honest, we're trying our best. But on the Dutch side, nothing's being done at all. That's why I'm here. The Hague has created a special unit, under my command. We're going to do this well. -You have no gear. We've got weapons from the army and support from the farmers. The farmers? -Certainly. That contraband butter from your country's bad for our farmers. It's going to change. I hope you're right. I don't have a high opinion of your authorities. Things have gotten worse and worse because they've been lazy. We're going to end this. You have excess butter. This smuggling suits you just fine. I have special orders. I almost have carte blanche. The uniforms. -Where's the butter? I need the uniforms. -They're only for emergencies. This is an emergency. -Did I lose 1000 kilos of butter? Put this on and if you do as I say, you might not lose anything at all. This is wrong. I'm the customer, you work for me. I don't want to be involved in this. -Don't you see I have one star more? I'm giving the orders here. Are your pants tucked into your boots? -Yes, why? In case you shit yourself. The captain and I have come from Brussels. We've got orders to get this car plus its cargo to Brussels. Talk to your superiors inside. -Certainly, Lieutenant. I can hear you sided with the Germans during the war. Who are they? -A captain and lieutenant from Brussels. They've come to get the car. -I don't know anything about that. That was the Rider, wasn't it? Did you recognise him? -I don't know. If you've recognised him, we've got a case against him. That suit, the glasses... it's been so long. We can't go on like this, Ruiter. I don't make enough on these butter trips. And I could lose the car too. Do you mean you want me to transport something else? I know where German weapons are hidden on the other side of the border. Another advantage of siding with the Krauts. Why don't I kick you up your ass? Because I let you do what you want. And I let you make good money. Those weapons only have to be taken to Antwerp. I don't like it. I'm a decent smuggler, not a criminal. Who talked to you about this? The Schellekens cousins. Those two bastards from Aardenburg? Did they try to pressure you? -No, it was all very businesslike. The Schellekens cousins are gangsters. I don't want to deal with those guys. You sound like Jesus. How can you refuse? You could make thousands of guilders. I'm out. And be warned: the Schellekens cousins are too dangerous for you. ID. Caught anything lately? Not you, that's for sure. Open the trunk. Alright. I want all the information about him. It's coming, Sir. Except, we don't have much about him. That's because we've never caught him yet. How are you, old customs man? -I've been away way too long. Let's celebrate this. You haven't changed. Still the same mug. And the same tricks up my sleeve. You're doing well by the looks of things. Did I wake you up? -Doesn't matter. It's a bit late to be in bed. -That depends. When I've had a night shift, I'll sleep in too. I came in just in time. They had just organised a new customs unit to stop smuggling in this area. And because I had been here during the war... and because of my army experience, they put me in charge. So you came in at the right moment? -Yes. What do you do these days? Let's say I'm a trader. That can mean many things. Another beer? -Yes. So the Belgians think it's high time we got our act together. They welcomed me with open arms. But I was overwhelmed by all the information they gave me. You were? -Yes. Your name was mentioned too. -You're kidding. They called you the Black Rider. Hey, Rinus, it's been so long. You should have warned us. I'd have made something to eat. Now I have to go to the business, next door. Another time then. We live just across the border now. Rinus is going to put an end to smuggling here. I'll drink to that. At the end, on your left. A whorehouse! As long as she likes it. It's incredibly profitable. Fons Ruiter, what has become of you? What has become of me? See this? You can't afford it. I'm so disappointed in you. I can do anything I want. I'm raking it in. -And I'm going to end that. Soon the Black Rider will be... I'll get you, mister! Please, tuan, I'm only 14! And don't tell me you didn't know. Take your pants off. What about my mother, tuan? -My buddy will fuck her. Fons, asshole! I got out of the way just in time. My friend almost ran me over. Fons, great to see you again. Didn't Milou come along? -No, she didn't feel well. What a shame. -Come in. I'll be right there. Caught any smugglers? Let's not beat around the bush. I'm happy to see an old friend again. -So am I. But we'll also meet in different circumstances. We will? -That's for sure. If it hasn't happened already. I like you, Fons. -I like you too, Rinus. But I'm here for my work. And I like to do my work well. I don't like to shoot at friends. -I don't like to run them over. One of these days, I may have to shoot at you. While that's the case, I don't like you visiting me. So finish your coffee, leave and don't come back. That's Liza. I don't want to give you a guilty conscience. Little children grow up. I'm a teacher. In Hulst. In that dress? -No, I was at a party tonight. I heard a lot about you there. You go upstairs. Mummy and daddy have to talk. I've been thinking and I don't want her to grow up with you. You're no better than me. I think we should send her to a boarding school. Because we're setting a bad example for her here? What about yourself? -That's only temporary. This whoring business of yours is here to stay. At least I worry about a child that isn't even mine. Are you insane? You live off the whoring business. I live off my own money. And who gave you that beautiful car? Who's always helping you? I understand. Your old friend Rinus thinks you're too good for this life. If we get the child out of here, she might become a decent person. Here she has no chance. Do you still love me? Look guys, a new child in our class. Tell us what your name is. -Rozeke Ruiter. Hello, Mr Ruiter, what a surprise. -Do I only get a handshake? We only kiss the children here. Will you look after her well? How did it go? -Fine. No problems? -Not really. I want to introduce you to a few people. Look, Ruiter. Straight from America. And this? -Real nylons. Seamless. Look what else we got. So you're the Black Rider. Yes, so what? We should get to know each other. -I don't think so. I don't smoke. Schellekens. -Congratulations. Drinks on the house. They're excellent customers. Why did you ruin it? The things they bring. Look. Seamless. Those are the Schellekens guys. They're underworld. And who are you? Small time smuggler. You could work for them. I don't work for gangsters. -If you could make 3 or 4 times more? Good evening. Ruiter's not cooperative. Has someone made a mistake? He must have misunderstood me. -Be clearer with him. We will be too. But if you could make 3 or 4 times more... What does it matter if it's butter or weapons? It's not about the weapons, but about the bastards who make money on them. But it's for a good cause. The weapons are for the Algerian rebels. That's a good cause. The Schellekens cousins have the contacts. I'm going to have a drink somewhere nice. He doesn't understand he's my only guarantee the cousins won't cheat me. When he's involved, I know I'll get my money. We'll see. The way he talks to you... He doesn't really love you. I've always thought that. What's your intention? You're never interested in me. Even though I can give you a good life. I'm going to do big business with those Schellekens men. Ruiter's risking his life for your stupid butter. Are you turning your back on him now? I'm paying him, ain't I? -But you make the most on it. Go get a girl there. Plenty of choice. You're leaning against my car. Now I need to have it washed again. You don't understand. We want to do business with you. Make money. Yes, go upstairs. I'll work my ass off with that bloody butter. Not so hard! Is anything coming? Customs officers? -No, the bull. I swear, they're fantastic drivers. But not as good as Ruiter. Ruiter's the best. Yes, but they're next. They're learning from Ruiter. Alright, we'll try it. But first a test run. Give them the car. Empty. Damn, customs officers. Did you confiscate it? -Last night. And the driver? -He got away. That's great but nothing has changed since you arrived. We're doing our best. I was almost run over the other day. Everybody's talking about the Black Rider. He's playing with our balls. Is it because you're friends? You were mates in the Resistance. And you've been to see him after you came back. We all know that. It's logical that people start to think that way. We'll have to crack down on them harder. My men get 10% of everything they confiscate. We don't have that in the Netherlands. The Dutchman calls that corruption. Do something about it, Uzerman. Are you the local comedian? -Only when the radio's off. It's war between us now. -Aren't we old friends? That's why it's war. They think I'm letting you get away. Because of our friendship. -But I'm not letting you get away. Not anymore. Are you challenging me? I accept the challenge. Cell tires. Indestructible. I put them on your car. Can I have that gun? -Arguing with Milou? What do you mean? -It's just a question. Uzerman's back at the border. -Damn. Are you going to shoot at him? -No, he wants to shoot at me. I don't want to be empty-handed. We're a flying brigade after all. I hope we don't see anything tonight. -Why not? They don't like to give way. I've never seen them stop at a traffic light either. What is it? A scout. Damn it! Don't start polishing your car. Go after him! Hear how they're shooting. -You'd think it was Chicago. This time he went too far with his stunts. He's used a flame-thrower. A gendarme got badly burned. When did it happen? -Last night. First he poured petrol over the road and then he lit it. But I was chasing the Black Rider myself last night. Are you sure? Or are you protecting your friend? No, I'm not sure. He's wanted for manslaughter in all of Belgium. Is there proof that he did it? -It was his Cadillac. Did someone recognise him or write down his license number? There's only one white Cadillac in the area. That's no proof. There are many white Cadillacs. You can go into hiding here. That seems the safest thing to do. I'd better go back to the Netherlands. I'd prefer if they caught me there. They'd kill me here. -You're wounded and you need to rest. Stay here. Sit down there. I'll make you breakfast. Jean-Louis! -What? You're not screwing me over, are you? We've been working together for years. I'm on your side. He's here now. Alright. I'll keep him occupied. We're coming. The coffee will be ready soon. It's not a court, Madam. You don't have to testify at all. The same applies to this gentleman. This morning I got a phone call that my friend Fons Ruiter... is accused of the murder of a Belgian gendarme... using a flame-thrower. That's not possible. Fons spent all night with me. Fons spent all night with you? There are plenty of witnesses. And another thing. He didn't drive his white Cadillac last night. He happened to have loaned his car to this gentleman. Right? There are plenty of witnesses. Who drove that car then? It was stolen from my property. It's going too far, Milou. He's involved in a murder case now. No, he's not involved. That's what I'm here to tell you. Do you think I'm an idiot, Milou? We were in the Resistance during the war. And now you act as if there's a secret brotherhood I'm not part of. Was I in the Resistance with you? Where were you during the liberation then? When they dragged me out of my house to shave my hair off? All those great countrymen who didn't do anything for four years. Where were you? You were too busy showing off your English uniform. You were too busy trying to shake hands with Prince Bernhard. You had forgotten all about me. But Fons arrived in his jeep. He took me away from all those people. I've never known this, Milou. There's a lot you don't know. You always knew the difference between good and bad. You still do. Well, I'm not so sure. But if I have to choose for or against Fons Ruiter... then I know exactly what to do. A bit of fresh air won't hurt here. Finally we can talk to you, Mr Ruiter. We've tried hard to contact you, Mr Ruiter. We were just talking about you. Everybody's looking for you. Customs, Belgian police, Milou, we. I don't like to work for you. But why on earth not? -I'm not ugly enough. But we can make you a great offer. -I don't have a choice. You don't think highly of us. -But we do think highly of you. Let's talk business. Alright, I want to be paid in dollars. You don't find me attractive anymore. But you used to. You couldn't keep your hands off me. I'm not fed up with Milou. I'm fed up with Chez Milou. If you'd give that up, I might stay with you. How can I give it up? I can't do anything else. That damned war turned me into a madam. You were there and you lived well off it. That's true, but it won't stay that way, Milou. That joint goes or I go. I'll use a high gear ratio and towards the end, I'll take the lead. If you stay behind me, you can win the sprint. That's true, Floor's the sharpest of them all. But Wies has a sharper tongue. He's not so sharp when it comes to buying rounds. That's because you always beat me to it. You're the sharpest at serving us rounds. Ladies and gentlemen, it's a big honour... that I've been asked as chairman of the jury. I don't know anything about cycling. I'll leave that to the officials. Please give them a hand. Nothing can happen, all the smugglers are participating in the race. Nothing can happen, all the smugglers are participating in the race. Where's Fons Ruiter then? I think I'll do the rounds as well. Our charming podium girl Liza Uzerman will now kiss the winner! You were ahead and you should have stayed ahead. I tried but I didn't have the power. I had bad legs! They overtook us in the bend. I tried to keep up with them. You were riding like a loser. Did you think we were all Wim Van Est? When Wim Van Est shits, you're not even allowed to smell it. "He was a smuggler in the deep of the night." "He made sure his contraband crossed the border alright." Open it. It's an advance, but it's enough to pay for our trip. Around the world? To a warm, exotic country. Trust me. Is it dangerous? It looks dangerous. You promised to help me. That you'd do one more thing for me. Yes, deal. Go to your father tomorrow and tell him there are weapons... at wharf 13 in Antwerp. There are weapons at wharf 13 in Antwerp. Tell him that. Just that. And not before tomorrow. If anything happens to me... If they catch me tonight... With weapons. -then you keep this money. Until you hear from me. I don't need any scouts tonight. -Why not, Ruiter? We've already lost the race today. -We're here to make a bit of money. It's for your own good that I don't want you there. This is the customs police. -Get out through the back door! Surrender! Surrender, you're surrounded! You don't have a chance. Come out without using any violence. We know it's you, Ruiter. Don't shoot! I guess you understand you're screwed. Why didn't you leave me alone, idiot? And let you get away with those weapons? I was going to give those weapons to you. I took them before you had the chance. I couldn't know that. -That's true. Just like I couldn't know you were hanging out with my daughter. So that's behind this. I don't want to see my daughter end up with a pimp. As if an over-achieving customs man is any better. There are more important things to life than a white Cadillac. So I'll charge you with arms smuggling. That's no small beer, as the Belgians would say. What do the Belgians have to do with it? -They'll turn it into a big case. We'll hear witnesses, together with the Belgians. A confrontation? -I'll get to the bottom of this. So you'll really hang, Fons. What do I owe that to, Rinus? You should have kept your hands off my daughter. Your mother and I did everything for you! Nothing was good enough for you. And then you sleep with that asshole! Father, he's your best friend. -He was my best friend. I want to see him one more time. That's not too much to ask. He'll want to see you too. -That's very convenient then. Did you think it was that easy? Marloes, I have to go away for an hour. Good that you came. I'm sure he'd like to see you. You knew she was here. -I hate it as much as you do. Who are you after? Me, yourself or your daughter? I'm after him. And I want a confrontation. A confrontation? -Yes. Together with the Belgians? You've been hunting him like a ferret. You were lucky to get him. But now I've got him! I'm charging him with arms smuggling. What do you say to that? Ruiter never wanted to have anything to do with arms. But he was caught with them. Explain that to me. -He's my man. I don't have to explain anything. You're a big asshole! I'll never forget what you've done to me! She's kind of right. Rozeke feels at home here. She's doing very well at school. She must have had a good teacher. I understand what you want, but I don't agree. Rozeke, hello sweetie. You can come with mummy. -But I was already asleep. You can sleep more in the car. I'll always live here, won't I? -Of course, we'll look after you. Where are you going, mummy? -To see daddy, darling. Will you be good when I'm gone? Promise me something, Fieneke. If anything strange happens, will you look after Rozeke? We found Fons Ruiter to be the driver of the car. We arrested him on suspicion of illegally supplying butter to Belgians. Upon inspection of the truck... ...attempted murder or manslaughter of two Belgian gendarmes. It heals very fast. We can't go back to the Netherlands for a while. Not until they've forgotten everything. And in the meantime we travel around the world. But we need money to do that. Passports. We need passports How did you do that? I found them. -Yeah, right. You'll be a good smuggler one day. A good smuggler doesn't need a passport... to travel around the world. -No. And a good lover only needs a good bed. Come in. Do you own the white car? Yes, why? Why? It's parked on the pavement. We're not in the Netherlands here. I'll be right there. Alright, but hurry up. Come! 3 in the kitchen and Go downstairs!
