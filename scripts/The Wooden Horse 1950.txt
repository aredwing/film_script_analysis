'Legs that would wriggle their toes disgustingly, 'as their owner prepared to land. 'I tensed myself expectantly for the routine - crash, bang! BANGING 'The whole hut shook. Heavy footsteps stomped the room. 'The violent stir of a spoon in a pottery mug. CLATTERING 'Bang! 'More footsteps, then the room shook again as the door slammed.' Noisy lot! CLOGS CLATTER ON STEPS Breakfast, please. You're cook. OK, Robert. What's the weather like? Perfect day for air rescue! Do you mind? Sorry. You'll wear it out! It feels like someone else is doing it. You're crazy. Give John a call, will you? Wake the child?! Louder! Let his bunk down! Must you be so hearty? DOOR SLAMS Raus! Raus! Goon in the block. Alles raus! Raus! Raus! Ah, Deutschland kaputt! Raus! Push off! We don't speak German. Careful, Paul. Ich verbitte mir das. Als Offizieren haben Sie sich angenehm zu benehmen. Ah, shove off! Er sagte, "Deutschland kaputt." So, you are impertinent again? I object to being shouted at. Come. OK. Suits me. Raus! Alles raus!  Parade, attention! Guten Morgen. THEY LAUGH AND JEER Parcels today, John. If we get biscuits we'll make a cake. If it ends up a pudding we'll eat it for dinner! If it's porridge we'll have it at breakfast! Soap. Hey! Sorry, Bill. I nearly swallowed it. How's it going? I've done 40 feet. HE WHISTLES Ferret! Now. He's stopped outside hut 66. He's looking. He's coming this way now. It's Charlie. He's gone away. Coming round the circuit? OK. Right, let's open it up again. Tunnel must be almost under here. It has no chance. See where it goes? He chose the hut nearest the wire. It's still 300 feet. It'll take six months at least. He's done 40 feet. That leaves 260 feet to go still inside the camp. This is the important place - these last few feet under the wire. It's the same old problem. The longer the tunnel we dig, the longer the goons have to spot it. We need a short tunnel, here, under the circuit. It's as bare as a billiard table. How would you hide it? Thanks! SHOUTS FOR THE BALL OK? OK. That's what we want. Some nice innocent camp activity that goes on all the time, like football. In my last camp, they sang round an accordion and dug in the middle, hiding the dirt in their sleeves. Got as deep as your arm in one day. They covered it with a board. And then? A ferret fell in and broke his leg! We can't use that, it must be a classic! Oh, lord, potatoes! Sorry, see you later. A classic. Give it over. BIG BAND MUSIC PLAYS This is a hell of a life, Pete. Is it better or worse being married? Least there's something waiting for you. I feel life is passing me by and when I get back it will be too late. It's not doing anything. Not even fighting. Clinton's running. I'd give anything to be out of here, even for a few days. Just do ordinary things - use a telephone, walk on grass, carpets, walk up and down stairs, use a lift. Spend money and make a decision. RATTLING Pete. What? I've got it. What? Hiding a tunnel near the wire - a Trojan Horse. What? The Greeks put men inside it. We'll make a vaulting horse. One of us digs under it while the rest vault. We're carried to and fro inside it. Strong horse! We'll do the horse. Let's tell the escape committee. Wait. No, register it. Someone could think of it at any moment. Sure to! OK, we'll go this evening. OK. You propose to take this thing out with a bloke inside, day after day, to cover the shaft? Yes, sir. Bit far-fetched! At least it's new! We can't support wildcat schemes because they're new! It's not wildcat, it's perfectly feasible. All right, Howard. We'll discuss it later. You need a horse first. We'll build it. Goons! Lock up time already! OK. Good night. ALL: Good night, sir. OK, Pete. We're out! All we need is the horse! Look, we need a few pieces of wood about that long and that thick. About THAT thick? OK! We'll climb in tonight. DOG BARKS BARKING CONTINUES Check! BANGING Bennett! Bennett! Hello! Must you? When I start something I finish it, old boy! Heaven help her! What? Check! Get out of that! How's this? Beautiful! Cutters, saw. How's the time? 20.28. BANGING Ready? Two minutes. Dog outside. BANGING INCREASES Time Tony got going. 8.30. HE WHISTLES Come on, boy! All clear. He's gone. Go! Now! They're out. After the next beam. Puss, puss, puss!  Puss! Puss, puss, puss! SAWING BANGING AND THUDDING Come in! Morning, Wing. What is it? Air-conditioning. I'll show you. See. I turn this handle. The pulley operates a fan under the floor. Cold air is forced up from under it. And the hot air? It goes through the roof. If you've time to waste, I haven't... Wing. It's about the camouflage for our hole. I'm making a vaulting horse. Hmm? It must be strong enough to carry a man. The Kriegie Construction Company is at your disposal. Thanks, Wing. Look. May I? Of course. Here, just a minute. It has to be five foot long and four foot high with a padded top. Hmm. We have timber for the frame. The sides will have to be plywood to minimise the weight. Parcel boxes? Fine. We want two bars going through for the bearers. The man will sit on one and bring back the sand in bags on hooks here. BANGING Put me down, John. Hopkins. Hut? 67. Craig, 65. I'll have a go. Your leg? It's OK.  OK, John. Ah, Bennett, just the man we want. Are you going to vault? No, old boy. He'd go slap through the horse. THUDDING CONTINUES What is this? Just a gym class, Fuhrer. Ach so. Always this craze for exercise. Right, who's going first? Come on, up and over. Go on! Good turn out, eh? You wait. Give it a few weeks! Oh! Come on, Phil. Go on. ROARS OF LAUGHTER It's planned, sir. Shows the goons nothing is inside. Here's the horse and here's the surface of the ground. The trap door is 18 inches down, in case they probe. We cover it with sandbags, so we can get to it quickly. The tunnel runs to the wire. The first ten feet is shored up top and sides. Is ten feet enough? Yes, for the impact. How do you ensure it's the same spot? Easy. The landing marks. How long will the job take you? We hope four weeks. The sooner the better. OK, Clinton, we'll back you. Good luck. Thanks. Good night. Good night. Better burn this diagram. DOOR SLAMS There you are, John. A pound of sand. Each bag holds ten pounds, 12 bags a trip, so, no more than 120 pounds a time. It'll be six weeks. We'll start tomorrow. We can't hurry the goons. We just vault first. So we'll only do three feet a day. Mm. We can't ask the chaps to vault all day for nothing! We must start. Once upon a time there were two bulls, an old bull and a young bull. The young bull said, "The gate to the cows is open. Let's run and get some!" "No," said the old bull, "Stroll down and get the lot!" Hoch! Gut! Sie konnen gehen. Ready, John. All clear? Yeah. Let's go, chaps. John! All set, Pete. Blanket, trowel and hooks, box. Right? Right. Victor? All clear. OK, John? Take it away! Ready. Lift. To me a little. Right, down. All right, Phil. Come on, over the top. All right? It's easy, old boy. Hold it, chaps. OK, John. Go, chaps. THUD OK, next. RHYTHMIC THUDDING Come on then, over. 'Dry top sand in the box.' That's better. THUD Improving, Phil. 'Now the wet undersand on the blanket.' Fine. I've never seen such a ropey lot! OK, blokes, a good run and a good jump. That's all you want. Next. Good. Come on, next. That's it. Come on, Peter. Feeling tired? Not bad. A bit more jump, old boy. Come on, chaps. Keep it going. Next. That's very good. Much better. Next. Time to pack up, John. Right, half a minute. It's getting on, Peter. Mmm. He's filling in now. OK, next! Last one. Pack up. Nick! David! OK, John? All aboard. Take it easy, Tony. OK, Peter. OK. A little higher. Is it through? OK, boys, lift. All clear? All clear. OK, chaps. Thank you, Gordon. Good show. Down you go. ALL: # We don't want to go to war # We'd rather stay at home among the paths to roam # And thinking of the daughters...# How's it going, John? Piece of cake, Bill. We'll be out before you are! #...Away # We'd rather be in England # In merry, merry England # And live to fight again another day. Cor blimey! # # Deutschland, Deutschland, uber alles # Deutschland, Deutschland # Ist kaputt... # Nehmen Sie doch vernunft an. ALL: # Uber alles # Deutschland, Deutschland ist kaputt... # Ich sage in das Hoffnung, Sie wollen es anders. Entweder so oder so! A FEW SING: # Deutschland... # So. Ah, bitte mein Herr. Danke schon. ALL: Danke! It will be about here. It's slow, John. 40 feet. In eight weeks. Not good. It's getting the sand back. The men are tired. I know, Phil. What's the answer? Come on, chaps. Nearly packing up time. I must check with the duty pilot. Keep them going, Phil. Don't worry. Watch that leg, Nick. It's OK. Let's have a series, eh? PHIL: OK, chaps, let's get cracking. Phil! Phil! I told you to watch that leg! Rub it! Look! Roof must have fallen in. Come this way. Rub it hard. Pretend I'm hurt. Get John. Stretcher! John, there's been a fall. Who? The tunnel. Is he trapped? Nick's on the hole. How do you feel? OK, John, you take over. Pete! Peter! Peter! I'm going down. You'll give the show away. I know. Peter! Peter! (Where's that stretcher?) (John!) Peter, are you OK? Hell of a mess! I'll try and clear it. Can you fill from the top? OK. Down here. And lift! Paul, cover that side. PHIL: Goons seem interested, old boy. Bandages. 12 minutes, John. Pete, 12 minutes to roll call! Carry on jumping, chaps. Let's go longways. We'll never do it! Gewehr hoch! Rechts herum! Kompanie marsch! HE COUGHS Pete, how are you? How's it going? OK. Nearly finished. How much longer, Paul? Five. Five minutes, Pete. Only five. OK, shore it up. You fill in from the top. Phil, give us a hand. PHIL: OK. Lift. Just a minute, chaps. Take my shirt, Nick. Pete - the guard's in! WHISTLE BLOWS They have to go, John. Do something, Phil. What? Do something! Schnell, schnell! I got my shirt on the wrong way. Los! Pete, we've got to go now. Take her away. Lift. Down. Up. MUSIC: "Pastoral" from Beethoven's 6th Symphony AUSTRALIAN ACCENT: Hey, sport! You know where I've been? Can't think. Danzig. I got through the wire with some other Aussies in the north compound. I nearly made it. I was just getting on a ship when a sentry spotted me. How long were you out? Three days. Got a bullet in the shoulder and a cold in the head from sleeping rough! What's Danzig like? There's no future there. It's stiff with troops. How do you get there? Jump the rattler. That's the way to get around. By train. Why not as a passenger? A foreign worker? They ask for your identity card. You've got to get a permit to travel. If you got through, you'd travel fast? They have train checks. You'd never get through. How could I get travel papers to copy? One of the goons. Try Dopey. Hey, Dopey! Here. My friend would like to see travel passes for foreign workers. I cannot. They shoot me. They shoot you for trading with us kriegies. My friend's a witness. You must not tell. Please! I have family. We will, Dopey. Report him now. Blackmail? Do you want to escape? Was machen Sie denn hier? Herr Oberst sagte der Mann musste gewechselt werden. Gut. Do you have something to say? How soon will I be out of here? Two days. I'll bring it tomorrow. Beethoven. He is a good German. Yeah, he's dead! Small one! Is that all? That's all. Come on, chap. You and Clinton share cook duty. Clinton's not here, so you do lunch. Clinton hasn't done it yet! It's the principle. So we suffer! It's not me. It's Clinton's laziness. Sweating in a tunnel is "laziness"? He still has duties! This tunnel's the excuse for everything. It's not even getting anywhere. I say, Clinton, we want lunch. And I won't get it. Was it my turn? I'm sorry. Howard... Shut up! This isn't good enough. We should split the mess into two. You should cater for yourselves. OK. Fair enough. What about you, Nick? I'll join you. Do you mind? How are you feeling? I'll be OK in a minute. How many bags today, Pete? Five. We'll never get out at this rate! We'll get out. Only five bags a trip. We could make two trips a day. Wouldn't the goons be suspicious? They think we're mad enough for anything. Still, that's only ten a day. Less when we get further. There must be a way. It isn't the digging, it's getting the sand out. How about a sort of sledge? That's it. We can go down together. The horse can't carry two. It would. AND the sand? Oh. I know! We both dig in the morning and leave the bags in the shaft. In the afternoon, ONE brings them back. Fine. Who will take charge on the surface? Phil does already. We must get him out of the camp too. He'll be trailing Germany with us. What about Nick? Nick! My leg puts me out. If we had to run for it, I'd be sunk. Go on and ask Phil. OK. On condition that he travels alone! Got it? Sure. See you at 2.30 then. Busy, Phil? Of course, I'm starting on my pantomime. Why not put it on in London? Yes, Drury Lane, old boy(!) Phil? Yes? Seriously. Come in with us, you'll be home by Christmas. What's the catch? Nothing. Why me? Knowing your efficiency. And your belief in OUR efficiency. OK, what do you want? Peter and I are going down together. Could you organise the vaulting? I do already! Then why are you worried? I'm not, I'm flattered. OK. OK, I'm in. Good show. Peter? Hmm? There is one thing. If it's all the same to you, I'd rather travel alone. I prefer it that way. I feel I do better on my own. We accept that condition.

Bad luck. Yours OK? So far. That's one thing, anyway. Must be three tons of sand up there! Name? Michel Condein. Born? Lille. Date? September 29, 1920. Nationality? French. Profession? Draughtsman.

Pete, your turn. Remember "Ich bin Auslander. Nicht verstehen." I'm a foreigner. I don't understand. Name? Marcel Levasseur. Born? Paris. Nationality? French. Wie heisst die zweite Schwester ihrer Mutter? Hmm? Ich bin Auslander. Nicht verstehen. No-one will with that accent! Well, how do I look? Commercial traveller - German style! Very good. Are you proposing to take those through the tunnel? These are my samples. Oh. I need samples. These serve a dual purpose. What are they? Margarine. I can eat them if I'm hungry. How are the combis getting along? I don't fancy those next to my skin. They smell revolting! Something's peculiar in the dye. "Peculiar" is an understatement! Here's your special rations. "Dog food" we call it. Mixed with water it's like porridge... Sort of! Chocolate, raisins and a couple of torches. Thank you. Could we see the Group Captain for a moment? Yes, come on. He has some money for you. Clothes look pretty good. David. - Howard and Clinton, sir. - OK. Gather round. Good evening, sir. Keep your voices low. Zero hour tomorrow, eh? What time do you break? 6pm. The train is at 6.30. What's your plan? Phil Roe is going alone to Danzig. John and I are going to Lubeck. If we don't get a ship, we'll stay in a hotel. It's worth trying. Here's your money. 120 marks each. Sorry we can't afford more. Thank you. One thing, sir. Would you stand in at roll call tomorrow? Stand in?! What for? There's three of us. We need a fourth to seal the trap. The horse won't carry four, so one of us is sealed down waiting for the rest. Not very pleasant. Who'll be sealed down? HOWARD AND CLINTON: I will! I can get on with digging. So can I! A great lout like you will use up more air! It was my idea! There's one way of settling this. The longest match goes first. Me. Good, it means I'll be first out of the tunnel too! RHYTHMIC THUDS ABOVE Yours. Mine. Phil's. It's pretty hot down here. Take it easy. I don't want to carry you out! I'll be OK. So long. Good luck. THUDS GET FAINTER BIG BAND MUSIC PLAYS Howard? Hmm? I've got a bit of German money here. It might come in handy. Thanks. LABOURED BREATHING Parade dismissed! Thank you, sir. Stand by. Phil! Ready?

How far is it? A couple of feet. Drink up, then, old boy. We haven't much time. All right. Lift. DOG BARKS Only a thin crust left! Right. Hold it. John's bag. Mine. Stand by. Peter! Good luck, Pete.

Perhaps you're right. We should move. It's not safe around here. HORN BLOWS GUARD COUGHS VIOLENTLY This is it. She's gone. Sure it's the right dock? Halt! He's seen us. OK. Halt! Wer da?

Find the pubs they go to. Where do we stay? We can't even get a shave. When we left camp, we planned to travel by train and stay in hotels. If we're going to find the Swedes, we must have a base. OK. Russians, I think. Any luck? No, full up. Always "full-up". Maybe foreign workers aren't allowed in hotels! MEN SPEAK IN FRENCH Ask one of these Frenchmen. They're not guarded. It's dangerous to talk to anyone. Go on, ask. Ask him. What if he tries to give us away? Wait until he's down the alley and get him on his own. All right. You keep an eye on him.

Jeg vil vaere glad for at hjalelpe. Jeg er altid bange. She thanks you, but she says she is not brave, she is glad to help you. She's always frightened. Tell her she's not the only one. Du er ikke den ernste. We must go. Thanks for all you have done. (I cannot find the sentry. I go to the quayside and fix the boat.) (You stay here until I am ready.) FOOTSTEPS APPROACH WHISTLING Ssst! WHISTLING CONTINUES Hilfe! Halt! Hilfe! Wer da? Come on. OK? Yes. OK. ENGINE CHUGS GENERAL CHATTER I say, you can't do this, it's the smartest place in Goteburg. Do what? Going up and down in lifts. I want to. Telephone! Hello, do you speak English? Stop! Swedes don't like this sort of thing. The consul will be furious. Invite him to lunch. I'm afraid we can't. In that case, can we get some money? Yes. Money and coupons. Three courses only, mind. Go easy, Sweden's frightfully expensive. Oh, is it? Thank you. Really! Thanks. Where would you like to sit? Right by the band. Phil! Would you excuse me? Certainly. My dear Howard! Here you are! How's the margarine? Gone! Phil, good to see you! Join us. No, join us. Meet Miss... Sonstrum. Charming girl. More schnapps. Let me introduce Flight Lieutenant Howard. Hello. Captain Clinton. They're old friends. They're also visiting Sweden. You come straight from England? Not quite straight! Well, here's to our little reunion! Here's to Sweden. Welcome to Sweden. Skol! Goons in the block. Oh, no, no. They're only on the German military attache staff. They're charming fellows. They wouldn't hurt a fly... here. I believe they think we shouldn't be here!
