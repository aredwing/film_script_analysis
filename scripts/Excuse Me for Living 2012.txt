MY FATHER WILL SUE YOUR ASS! I DON'T CARE IF MARY, MOTHER OF GOD, WEAVED IT HERSELF. YOU ARE NO KILLING YOURSELF ON MY BEAT. ( siren approaching ) I WAS SIMPLY TAKING A LEISURELY STROLL TO VISI MY POETRY PROFESSOR IN HOBOKEN, YOUR HONOR, WHEN THIS VERY LARGE POLICEMAN ACCOSTS ME FROM NOWHERE, APPLIES A NO DOUB STEROIDS-INDUCED THRASHING, AND CONJURES WHAT'S PROBABLY A $150 TAILORING REPAIR JOB ON MY BILL BLASS. HE CLAIMED IT WAS ARMANI. - SCREW THE COUTURE. - CO-WHO? BLESS YOU, OFFICER FRANKLIN. AND OVERALL, I MIGHT SAY, JUDGE... KAMEL. - NO. KARMEL. YES, KARAMEL. THIS VERY LARGE GENTLEMAN, AND SUPPOSED PROTECTOR OF THE COURT, PROVED HIMSELF TO BE EXTREMELY INHOSPITABLE. NEVERTHELESS, IN THE SPIRI OF THE CHRISTMAS SEASON, I'M WILLING TO DROP ALL CHARGES AGAINST HIM IF YOU'LL JUST KINDLY-- WHAT, REMOVE THE HANDCUFFS? AND MAY 16th IS NO TYPICALLY THOUGHT OF AS A WINTER HOLIDAY. ( voice echoing ) YOU'RE GETTING TO BE A REGULAR HERE, DANIEL TOPLER. IT'S UNUSUAL TO SEE EVEN YOUNG DRUG ADDICTS LIKE YOU HERE THREE TIMES A MONTH. YELLOW WALLS DO NOTHING FOR THE DECOR. - WHY ARE THE LIGHTS SO DIM? - TOPLER! ARE YOU FEELING OKAY? SEND HIM BACK TO THE REHAB CLINIC AGAIN. ( normal voice ) AND GET SOMEONE TO WIPE UP THAT DROOL, OFFICER FRANKLIN. DR. FRANKENSTEIN, I PRESUME. I'M DR. JACOB Q. BERNSTEIN. AND I'M FELIX THE CAT. MEOW. LET ME OUTTA HERE, OR I WILL KICK YOUR 2,000-YEAR-OLD ASS FROM HERE TO KINGDOM COME. FUCK!! ( scornful laughter ) OH, I MUST SAY, YOU DON'T LOOK SO HO YOURSELF, DR. BERNAISE. - BERNSTEIN. - YES, BERN-STINE. WHY DON'T YOU SIT DOWN AND WE'LL CHAT A WHILE. I COULD USE THE COMPANY. BUT FIRST, WOULD YOU MIND SCRATCHING MY NOSE? SOME FLY PROBABLY SENT BY A RIGHT-WING NEO-NAZI LUFTWAFFE HAS BEEN DIVE-BOMBING ME. A LITTLE TO THE LEFT. AH! YOU ARE A HEALER. AS A CSN&Y SONG GOES, "I'M NOT FEELING UP TO PAR." DO YOU THINK I SHOULD CUT MY HAIR, BECAUSE I ALMOST DID BEFORE I JUMPED OVER MARTHA. THE BRIDGE, THAT IS. LINDA. OH. OH, NO. OH, YES. OOH. OOH-OOH. ( grunts ) HELP. SAVE ME, PLEASE. ( knocking ) GOOD MORNING! GOOD MORNING, DANIEL! HURRY UP FOR BREAKFAST. THE VOLLEYBALL TOURNAMEN STARTS SOON. I'LL HAVE WHIPPED CREAM LICKED OFF YOUR BREASTS. I'M NOT ON THE MENU, DANIEL. WHY SCREW MY OLD MAN WHEN YOU CAN HAVE A YOUNG STUD LIKE ME, ELAINE? ( door opens ) WELL, I SEE YOU'RE VERY MUCH AT HOME HERE, DANIEL. DR. BERNSTEIN. WHAT DAY IS THIS? SATURDAY, 9:00 A.M. YOU HAD QUITE A NAP. I SEE YOUR FATHER'S MILLIONS HAVE FURNISHED THE ROOM FROM YOUR MANHATTAN LOFT. HM. HAVE YOU READ THIS? ANYONE WHO'S EVER TAKEN PSYCHOLOGY 101 HAS READ CARL ROGERS' SEMINAL WORK ON BECOMING A PERSON. ALAS, THERE'S NO TIME FOR NICETIES. GOTTA BE GOING. TA-TA FOR NOW, BUT DUTY CALLS. WHEN ONE'S PRESIDEN BEGS ONE TO SERVE ONE'S COUNTRY, CAN ONE REFUSE? IT'S HUSH-HUSH. TOP SECRE AND ON THE Q.T. SOMETHING ABOU A SCROFULOUS TORSO LEVITATING FROM KIM SONG'S TOMB. YOU JUST CAN'T TRUS THOSE BASTARD KOREAN DICTATORS TO STAY DEAD. WHERE ARE THE STANDARDS, ANYHOW? BY THE WAY, DID MY DAD HAVE MY CAR BROUGHT AROUND YET? SHALL I CALL LINDA AGAIN? NO. THAT WON' BE NECESSARY. CAN WE TALK? OKAY, DOC. SIT DOWN. TAKE A LOAD OFF. SURE, LET'S BE PALS, BUT IT DEPENDS. IT DEPENDS, HUH? ON WHAT? ON JUST WHAT KIND OF HEADSHRINKER YOU ARE. MY OWN PREFERENCE LEANS HEAVILY TOWARDS THE DRUGGIES. PSYCHO-PHARMACOLOGISTS, YOU MEAN. I LOVE THE GREEN PILLS, BUT YELLOW WORKS FOR ME IF IT WORKS FOR YOU. THE YELLOWS WORK FOR YOU, HUH? OH, I FEEL A ROGERIAN COMING ON. CARL ROGERS HELPED MANY, MANY PEOPLE. NOW, IF YOU'RE NO PUSHING DRUGS, I WAS HOPING YOU MIGHT BE MY SECOND-FAVORITE KIND OF VOODOO DOCTOR. YOU OKAY? UH, YEAH. DOC? WHOA! - THANK YOU. - YEAH. I WANNA TELL YOU ABOU A DISCUSSION I LEAD. OH, MAN, OH, MAN. HERE WE GO WITH THE GROUP THERAPY. IF I HAVE TO LISTEN TO ONE MORE SAD SACK TELL ME THE PITIFUL STORY OF HIS LIFE, I WILL LOSE MY MIND. FORGET ABOUT IT, DOC. NO, NO, NO. IT'S NOT LIKE THAT AT ALL. THIS IS A BUNCH OF MEN JUST GETTING TOGETHER TO KIBBUTZ. WHAT'S THE CATCH? A SCHMOOZE WITH YOUR STIFFS, AND THEN I'M OUTTA HERE? NOT PRECISELY. JUST GET TOGETHER A FEW TIMES. A FEW TIMES? - YES, MORE OR LESS. - MORE OR LESS?! SIT DOWN! NOW, LISTEN TO ME, YOUNG MAN. LISTEN UP CLOSELY. IF YOU EVER WANT TO GET OUT OF HERE, YOU SHOULD TAKE MY OFFER. YOU UNDERSTAND? ALL RIGHT. GOOD. NOW I'D LIKE YOU TO JOIN IN A DISCUSSION WITH MY SENIOR MEN'S GROUP. YOU ARE KIDDING, AREN'T YOU? WE MEET A TEMPLE B'NAI ISRAEL. BUT YOU'LL HAVE TO COME BACK HERE WHEN YOU'RE NOT AT THE MEETINGS. A TEMPLE MEN'S GROUP FOR DYING PEOPLE. THIS REALLY IS RICH. A LOT OF US ARE NO QUITE AS DEAD AS YOU MAY THINK. WHEN I CALL MY DAD, HE WILL HAVE ME OUT OF HERE IN A NANO-SECOND. FUN TIME IS OVER. THE COURT PUT YOU IN MY CUSTODY. BESIDES, YOUR FATHER THINKS IT'S A VERY GOOD IDEA. WELL? I'M JUS GIVING YOUR PROPOSAL THE UTMOST CAREFUL CONSIDERATION. NO. ALL RIGHT. I'LL BE BACK IN A MONTH TO SEE IF YOU'VE RECONSIDERED. LINDA, JOE. PUT YOUR HAND IN THERE. Daniel: LINDA. OKAY. OKAY, THIS IS BLACKMAIL! I WILL ATTEND YOUR MUMMIFIED DECAFFEINATED KAFFEE KLATSCH. FINE. GOOD CHOICE. SO SHOULD I BRING MY OWN DENTURES, OR DO YOU PASS ONE SE AROUND FOR EVERYONE? TOMORROW, 8:00 P.M., YOU CAN USE YOUR OWN CAR. NURSE LINDA WILL GIVE YOU A PRESCRIPTION TO HELP YOU SLEEP, AND AN ANTI-ABUSE PILL. DO NOT... I REPEAT, DO NOT USE ANY DRUGS OR ALCOHOL HERE, OR YOU WILL REALLY FEEL LIKE YOU'RE DYING. - ( dialing phone ) - ( line ringing ) - HELLO. - DAD. I'M BACK HERE A THE LIVE FREE OR DIE CLINIC.

THIS SHRINK SAID I'VE GOT TO ATTEND SOME ALTA KOCKER DISCUSSION GROUP. ISN'T THA A YUK AND A HALF? I THINK IT'S AN EXCELLENT IDEA, DANIEL. - DR. BERNSTINE AND I-- - BERNSTEIN. DR. BERNSTEIN AND I CHEWED IT OVER EARLIER TODAY. HE'S A HIGHLY REGARDED EXPERT FOR CASES LIKE YOURS. NOW JUST A SECOND, DAD. NO, YOU JUST A SECOND, SONNY BOY. I HAVE PLACED YOUR WELFARE COMPLETELY IN THE DOCTOR'S HANDS. OBVIOUSLY, YOUR MOTHER AND I HAVE GOTTEN NOWHERE WITH YOU. WHATEVER DR. BERNSTEIN SAYS, GOES, AND THAT'S THAT. FATHER! OH, I LOVE I WHEN YOU CALL ME THAT. DON'T FORGET TO WRITE. NOW, WHERE WERE WE? OH, HONEY. OH, ALBERT. ( both moaning ) OH, YEAH, OH, YEAH. OH. OH, NO. WHAT HAPPENED? I DON'T THINK I CAN, DOLL. OH...

HOW DO YOU LIKE THAT DIAMOND BRACELE I GOT YOU? THE TOPLERS AREN'T CHEAP. WHAT WAS THAT, ELAINE? UM, A FIREFLY, I THINK. - FIREFLY? - FORGET ABOUT IT. ( defecates wetly ) OH, LOOK AT THAT. HOW AM I GONNA GO HOME? JUST RUN IN AND TELL HER THAT YOU GOTTA GO REAL BAD. YOU. YOU'RE LIKE WEBSTER'S. YOU HAVE THE RIGHT WORDS FOR EVERYTHING. IF ONLY I HAD A WIFE LIKE YOU. YOU WILL HAVE A WIFE LIKE ME, AL, VERY SOON. LOOK AT MY HUSBAND WITH THIS HARLOT ELAINE. OKAY. - CHARLOTTE DAVIDSON HERE. - MISS DAVIDSON, HARRIET TOPLER. THIS TIME, I HAVE PICTURES OF MY HUSBAND CHEATING ON ME. DON'T WORRY, MRS. TOPLER. AS YOUR ATTORNEY, WE'LL TAKE HIM FOR ALL HE'S GOT, OR MY NAME ISN' CHARLOTTE DAVIDSON. Man: PIROT, LET'S GE A MOVE ON. THE COSTUME BALL MUST BE PERFECT. DID YOU ARRANGE FOR THE NOTRE DAME TWINS TO BE HERE? THE CHAMPAGNE, THE ORGANIC HORS D'OEUVRES? JAZZ BAND?

BESIDES, THERE'S YOUR ADORING PUBLIC TO CONSIDER. YOU WIN, BRUCIE. NO WONDER YOU BAG ALL THOSE MERGERS AT MORGAN STANFIELD. OKAY, CATCH YA LATER. ( knocking on door ) TAKE JUST ONE OF EACH AT BEDTIME, NOT BEFORE. YOU HAVE TO SUBMIT TO DAILY BLOOD AND URINE TESTS. NO DRIVING, EXCEPT FOR THE MEN'S GROUP, AND FOR GOD'S SAKE, DO NOT TAKE ANY DRUGS OR ALCOHOL. Man: ARE YOU PLAYING? WHAT'S GOIN' ON HERE? ( men continue chattering ) JESUS. I GOT TO KEEP MY IMAGE WHILE SUSPENDED FROM MY THRONE  THAT LOOKS OUT UPON MY KINGDOM FULL OF PEOPLE ALL UNKNOWN  WHO IMAGINE I'M NOT HUMAN AND MY HEART IS MADE OF STONE  I NEVER HAD NO PROBLEMS AND MY TOILET'S TRIMMED WITH CHROME  I'M A MAN, YES, I AM  AND I CAN'T HELP BUT LOVE YOU SO  NO, NO, NO I'M A MAN, YES, I AM  AND I CAN'T HELP BUT LOVE YOU SO  NO, NO, NO YES, I AM  NO, NO, NO HEY, HEY, HEY, HEY HEY, HEY, HEY YES, I AM ( men chattering nearby ) TWO PAIR, ACES UP, READ 'EM AND WEEP, SUCKERS!

Bruce: YOU MEAN CHARLOTTE DAVIDSON. OKAY, MY MAN. TAKE THIS FOR GOOD LUCK. JUST WAIT UNTIL HE DISCOVERS SHE'S A KARATE BLACK BELT. AND HER FATHER'S EVEN RICHER THAN HIS. DIDN'T YOU FORGE MY CHANGE AT McDONALD'S THIS AFTERNOON? AND I ASKED FOR THE ONION RINGS, NOT THE FRIES. WELL, EXCUSE ME, SIR. I HOPE I CAN FIND A WAY TO MAKE IT UP TO YOU. CHAMPAGNE! I'M DAN TOPLER, AND NO, I'M ON THE WAGON JUST NOW. - UH... - CHARLOTTE DAVIDSON. MY FRIENDS CALL ME CHARLIE. SO YOU'RE THE DANDY MAN. YOU KNOW, I'VE BEEN PANTING TO MEET YOU. LET'S GET ON THE WAGON TOGETHER. JUST HAVE A SQUOSH. IT'S PRONOUNCED "SKOSH." OKAY. SKOSH. HAVE ONE. YOU'LL FEEL BETTER, AND SO WILL YOUR WAGON. ONE MORE. SHOULD WE TELL HIM THA CHARLIE'S COME FROM THE DARK SIDE? HE'LL FIND OU SOON ENOUGH. ( people cheering and cat-calling ) Man: SHE'S A KILLER, DAN! - JUDGE KARAMEL? - JUDGE WHO? THAT'S HAUTE COUTURE, YOU IMBECILE. BLESS YOU, OFFICER FRANKLIN. Bernstein: I COULD LOCK YOU UP IN A STRAITJACKE FOR THE NEXT YEAR, OR I COULD TIE YOU UP AND HAVE LINDA SPOON-FEED YOU MOST OF YOUR MEALS. AN INTERN WOULD COME IN AND REMOVE YOUR POTTY FOR YOU, WHEN HE REMEMBERS. IS THIS WHA YOU REALLY WANT? DON'T YOU KNOW YOU ALMOS DIED RIGHT HERE IN FRONT OF ME, YOU LITTLE MORON? I LIKED YOU BETTER AS DR. FRANKENSTEIN THAN YOUR NEW ROLE AS NURSE RATCHED. I DON'T CARE HOW ROTTEN YOU FEEL TOMORROW, DANIEL. YOU MUST ATTEND THE DISCUSSION GROUP. THIS IS YOUR FINAL CHANCE WITH ME, OR I'M SHIPPING YOU UP TO PRISON. GOT IT? OH, BOY. THIS FUNERAL'S EVEN MORE SOMBER THAN THEY USUALLY ARE. DID YOU FIX MY LUNCH, BY THE WAY? THE CURRIED EGG SALAD SANDWICH WITH THE PICKLE ON THE TOP, THE WAY I LIKE IT. - YES, REVEREND PILATUS. - THAT'S GOOD. OH, I SHOULD'VE BEGGED OFF THIS GIG. I NEVER WOULD'VE EVEN ACCEPTED THIS SERVICE, EXCEPT THAT HIS DAUGHTER HAS MADE A TREMENDOUS DONATION. HER NAME IS CHARLOTTE, AND SHE IS A PIECE OF WORK. ( trills tongue ) WHAT'S CHARLOTTE DAVIDSON'S PERSONAL CASH FLOW? WITH DADDY DEAD, AND COMBINED WITH HER TRUST FUNDS, I'D SAY SOMETHING LIKE WHOO! AND DEBT? MAYBE 500. MILLION. NO. $500. SHE PAYS IN CASH. YOU MEAN THIS DAME INHERITED A COMPANY WORTH TWO BILLION SMACKERS, AND SHE OWES 500 BUCKS? YES, AND THAT'S JUS AN AVERAGE OF HER MONTHLY CREDIT CARD BILL. IT COULD BE LESS. WHAT ABOUT CHARLOTTE HERSELF? PERSONAL HABITS, FRIENDS? SHE'S A BIG-TIME PARTY GIRL AND ATHLETE. A KARATE BLACK BELT, AND SHE REGULARLY WINS COMPETITIONS. A DIVORCE ATTORNEY, ONLY FOR WOMEN, AND PRETTY GOOD AT IT, JUDGING BY ALL HER CLIENTS' AWARDS. SHE WINS EVERY TIME IN COURT, AND LIKES TO POUND MEN TO THE GROUND. GREAT. A MONSTROUSLY RICH, KUNG FU, TIGHTWAD, LITIGATING BALL BUSTER STANDS IN THE WAY OF THIS MERGER. YOU MUST BE ZOE, MY DEAR. NO ONE'S EVER CALLED ME THAT BUT MY FATHER. YES, YOUR FATHER GANYMEDE AND I WERE GREAT FRIENDS. AND YOU ARE? PLEASE FORGIVE ME. I'M BARRY BLACKMON, PROFESSOR OF GREEK AND ROMAN HISTORY. AND I MUST SAY, YOUR FATHER WOULD BE SO HAPPY TO KNOW YOU WERE DRESSED THE WAY YOU ARE, IN THE GREEK TRADITION OF WHITE, CELEBRATING THE IMMORTALITY OF THE SPIRIT, AS OPPOSED TO BLACK, MOURNING A PASSED SOUL. YOUR FATHER OFTEN TOLD ME OVER A GLASS OF WINE JUST HOW BEAUTIFUL HIS DAUGHTER WAS. I HAD NO IDEA HOW UNDERSTATED HIS WORDS WERE. DADDY SAID HE LOVED LOOKING THROUGH HIS TELESCOPE AT THE CONSTELLATION TAURUS, BECAUSE IT REMINDED HIM OF ME... BULL-HEADED BUT SENSITIVE. SO SORRY TO INTERRUPT. ANOTHER TIME, MISS DAVIDSON. ANOTHER TIME. AS YOU WERE SAYING, MY DEAR. ( sighs ) DADDY NEVER SHOWED ME HOW TO USE HIS TELESCOPE. WHAT A SHAME. PERHAPS I COULD SHOW YOU. YOUR FATHER BOUGH THE ONE THAT I RECOMMENDED. OH, HE DID. PERHAPS WE COULD GET TOGETHER AND DISCUSS HOW I COULD CONTINUE HIS LOVE OF ANTIQUITY. OF COURSE, ZOE. HOW SWEET OF YOU TO CONSIDER IT. AND WHO IS THIS CHARMING FRIEND OF YOURS? - YOU LOOK FAMILIAR. DO I KNOW YOU? - I'M LAURA, PROFESSOR. WHEN SHALL WE MEET AGAIN? IN THUNDER, LIGHTNING, OR IN RAIN? WHY DON'T I PICK YOU UP AT YOUR OFFICE WEDNESDAY AT NOON, AND WE'LL HAVE LUNCH. SPLENDID. OKAY, IF I HAVE TO GIVE HER HALF THE COMPANY, I WILL. SHE'S BEEN MY WIFE FOR 30 YEARS, AFTER ALL. YOU ALREADY GAVE HER HALF FIVE YEARS AGO FOR ESTATE-PLANNING PURPOSES. HER ATTORNEY WANTS MORE. WHAT? THE GOLD-DIGGER. WE'VE ONLY BEEN MARRIED FOR 30 YEARS. SIT. NINETY PERCENT. - NINETY PERCENT?! - ( wheezing cough ) ( wheezing continues ) THAT'S PRACTICALLY HIS ENTIRE... ( gasping ) PRACTICALLY HIS ENTIRE NET WORTH, MS. DAVIDSON. YOU ARE LUCKY WE'RE LEAVING HIM WITH HIS JOCKEY SHORTS. HONEY BUNCH, YOU KNOW IT'S ONLY YOU I EVER REALLY LOVED. OH, I WISH I COULD BELIEVE YOU. IS THAT WHAT YOU SAY TO HER, TOO? IF YOU HADN'T SPEN SO MUCH TIME A THE ART CENTER, I NEVER-- AND TELL YOUR CLIEN NEVER TO TALK TO MINE AGAIN IF HE WANTS TO KEEP HIS... UNDERWEAR. WHAT ARE YOU DOING? DON'T LOOK AT THAT. DANIEL, DANIEL, DANIEL. HOW COULD YOU DO THIS AGAIN TO YOUR MOTHER AND ME? WHY DOES EVERYTHING THAT HAPPENS TO ME HAVE TO DO WITH YOU AND MOM? YOU GOT A BEAUTIFUL VIEW HERE. YOU KNOW THAT, DANIEL? HAVE YOU LOOKED OUTSIDE TODAY? IT'S GORGEOUS. YOU'RE LICKING YOUR CHOPS OVER ELAINE, NO DOUBT. IS SHE ON THE BEACH BOUNCING HER TITS IN VOLLEYBALL? YOU'RE VERY RUDE, DANIEL. HOW CAN YOU THROW YOUR LIFE AWAY LIKE THIS? YOU WHO HAD EVERY ADVANTAGE IN LIFE, EVERY POSSIBILITY. EVERY POSSIBILITY? IS IT TOO LATE TO BE A PENGUIN? YOUR LIFE IS NO A SITCOM, BOYCHICK. YOU SHOULD BE ASHAMED TO BE SO THANKLESS. WHAT ARE YOU DOIN' HERE? DANIEL IS MY SON, TOO. ANYWAY, I'M NO SUPPOSED TO TALK TO YOU. WHAT'S THA SUPPOSED TO MEAN? ARE THE TWO OF YOU FINALLY GETTING A DIVORCE? - YES. - NO. I LOVE YOUR MOTHER. YOU GOT A FUNNY WAY TO SHOW IT. ( stammers ) COUPLES HAVE PROBLEMS, BUT THEY WORK THEM OUT. LOOK, WHY DON'T YOU COME TO UNIVERSAL LIKE YOUR SISTER? WE'LL MAKE YOU A VICE-PRESIDENT OR SOMETHING. AND THE PAY IS NO SO BAD, EITHER. I MEAN, 100 GRAND A YEAR WILL KEEP THE WOLF AWAY, AS LONG AS MOMMY AND DADDY PROVIDE A HOLIDAY BONUS AND A NEW CAR EVERY NOW AND THEN. AND WASTE MY LIFE BEING A JUNK DEALER LIKE YOU? YOU WATCH YOUR TONGUE. YOUR FATHER'S COMPANY, TOO UNDIGNIFIED FOR AN IVY LEAGUE COLLEGE BOY, KEEPS US IN LUXURY, PAL, AND DON'T YOU FORGET IT. YOU KNOW, HE DIDN'T HAVE A FATHER WHO GAVE HIM EVERYTHING UNDER GOD'S CREATION. WHY SEND ME TO YALE IF YOU JUST WANT ME TO TAKE OVER THE BUSINESS? NO, WE WANT YOU TO GROW UP. BUT AS YOU SAY, YOU JUST DON'T GET IT. WHAT KIND OF SON DID WE RAISE, ANYWAY? ( sighs heavily ) GLAD YOU CAME, MOM AND DAD. REALLY. ( men talking quietly ) OH, DAN, BRING YOUR CUP OVER HERE, AND COME AND MEE THE MEN, ALL RIGHT? GOT A SPECIAL GUES THIS EVENING. DANIEL TOPLER. I WAS HOPING ALL OF YOU WOULD BE AGREEABLE TO HAVING HIM ATTEND SOME MORE SESSIONS. CERTAINLY. WHY NOT. JACK, WHY DOES A YOUNG MAN LIKE HIM WANT TO COMMUNE WITH A BUNCH OF OLD FOGIES? MORTY MAVIS. PLEASED TO MEET YOU. MORTY IS A BUSINESS CONSULTANT. WELL, UH, FOR ME, I GUESS YOU SHOULD ALL KNOW-- DANIEL, LET ME DO THE INTRODUCTION, ALL RIGHT? DANIEL'S A MEDICAL STUDEN IN HIS FIRST YEAR A STONY BROOK, AND I UNDERSTAND HE'S CONSIDERING GERONTOLOGY AS, WELL, AS A SPECIALTY. ( men chuckling ) I FIGURED IF HE ME YOU OLD GUYS, I COULD POSSIBLY DISCOURAGE HIM FROM THAT. ( laughter ) SO YOU'RE GONNA BE A DOCTOR, IS THAT IT? WELL-- I'VE BEEN A TRADER FOR ALMOS AND VERY SUCCESSFULLY, TOO, I MIGHT ADD. I LEFT MY FIRM LAST MONTH. OH, I'M ROB VITRIOFF. THEY ASKED ME TO STAY, OF COURSE, - BUT FOR WHAT, I ASK YOU? - I THINK-- I CAN TRADE JUST AS WELL AT HOME NOW WITH THE INTERNET. MY TIME IS MY OWN. DO YOU SEE WHAT I'M GETTIN' AT? YES. YOU ONLY BORE YOURSELF NOW. GLENN HERE. TRACY AUSPITZ. NICE TO MEET YOU. AND TRACY WAS A FORMER DEPUTY ADMINISTRATOR FOR THE E.P.A.

NOW I CAN' SPEAK TO HIM, OR EVEN MY GRANDDAUGHTER CAROL ANYMORE. WE USED TO GET TOGETHER FOR GRANDDAD-GRANDDAUGHTER TIMES. SHE WON'T SAY TWO WORDS TO ME NOW. HE'S GETTING DIVORCED, AND HE'S STILL LIVING AT HOME. IT'S TERRIBLE FOR CAROL. SHE'S CAUGHT BETWEEN HER PARENTS. - YOU CAN'T HELP. - NO. I CAN'T HELP. HE'S MY SON, CAROL IS MY GRANDDAUGHTER, AND I CAN'T HELP. I CAN ONLY WATCH. AT LEAST WE'RE LUCKY WE ALL HAVE CHILDREN WE CAN RELY ON. I DON'T HAVE ANY CHILDREN I CAN RELY ON. MORTY, YOU GO TWO GROWN KIDS. IF YOU'RE IN TROUBLE, YOU CALL THEM. YOU, JACK. YOU I'LL CALL IF I'M SICK, NOT MY CHILDREN. I HARDLY TALK TO THEM. YOU ALL REMEMBER WHEN I GOT BAR MITZVAHED AGAIN? YOU ALL WERE THERE. - YEAH. - YES. MY KIDS COULDN'T BELIEVE THEY THOUGHT THEY WOULD BE THE ONLY ONES WHO WOULD BE THERE. THERE'S YOUR SISTER YOU COULD CALL IF YOU WERE ILL. HAVEN'T SPOKEN TO HER IN OVER A YEAR. AND FORGET ABOUT MY EX. NOT ON SPEAKING TERMS. ( men chattering and laughing ) IT'S NOT EASY NOT BEING THE MAIN GUY ANYMORE. WE ALL KNOW THA BY NOW.

HE KNOWS THAT MEN MY AGE AREN'T ONLY UNATTRACTIVE TO YOUNGER WOMEN, WE'RE INVISIBLE. ISN'T THAT RIGHT, THOMAS? YES, PLEASE, THE USUAL PLACE. I THOUGHT, ZOE, WE WOULD DINE WHERE YOUR FATHER AND I USED TO SUP. I HOPE YOU ENJOY THE FINES OF NEW YORK'S HAUTE CUISINE. - YASSOU. - YASSOU FILE MOU. HOW'S BUSINESS?

HE WAS MY MENTOR. WE PUBLISHED A COUPLE OF PEER REVIEW ARTICLES TOGETHER. WE WERE CLOSE FRIENDS, AND COLLEAGUES. YOU'RE A CLOSE FRIEND AND COLLEAGUE OF CARL ROGERS. YES.

AS YOU ALL KNOW, JACK HAS TO HAVE SURGERY FOR THE TUMOR THEY FOUND LAST MONTH, AND JACK, WHY DON'T YOU TAKE IT FROM THERE, HUH? ACTUALLY, THEY FOUND TWO TUMORS TWISTED AROUND MY KIDNEY. THEY'RE GONNA SCHEDULE SOME MORE TESTS, AND MY OPERATION WILL BE SOON AFTER. BUT WHAT SCARES ME MOS IS THE FACT THAT, AFTER ALL THESE YEARS OF BEING A DOCTOR, I'M JUST A STRANGER, ANOTHER PATIENT IN A HOSPITAL I NEVER EVEN VISITED. I ALMOST NEVER LOSE PHONE NUMBERS, BUT WHAT CAN I SAY? THE PRESSURES OF DAILY LIFE, THE CORPORATE BOARD MEETINGS, THE PRESS INTERVIEWS, ET CETERA, ET CETERA. THEY SUCK THE LIFE OUT OF YOU. SO PLEASE, GIVE IT TO ME AGAIN. NOT TOO FAST, 'CAUSE I'M A LITTLE SLOW. ACTUALLY, YOU'RE AS FAS AS THEY COME. AND SINCE WE'RE BROTHER AND SISTER, WHY DON'T YOU ASK OUR FATHER IF YOU'VE FORGOTTEN THE NUMBER. AH, YES. MY LITTLE FIB. WHAT DID DADDY-O SAY ABOUT ME? DADDY-O DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING AT ALL. WHAT SHALL WE SAY? ( sighs ) I'M A PATIENT OF DR. BERNSTEIN'S AT LIVE FREE OR DIE. I'M HERE A THE NEW BEGINNINGS MEETINGS TO WITNESS THE REAL DIFFICULTIES AND PLEASURES OF LIFE AND AGING. I'M FORBIDDEN TO DRINK ALCOHOL OR TAKE DRUGS. THE MIXTURE, WITH MY MEDICINE, MIGHT KILL ME. CONCISE CONFESSION AND SELF-ANALYSIS. THAT'S EXCELLENT, DANIEL. HONEY, I GOTTA GO. I GOTTA GET UP EARLY TOMORROW, OKAY? YOUR NUMBER, LAURA? LOOK, I WANNA TALK TO YOU. YOU'RE MY PATIENT, AND YOU'RE STILL IN DANGER, IT SEEMS TO ME. FURTHERMORE, THIS IS NOT THE TIME TO PURSUE ROMANTIC INTERESTS. YOU DON'T THINK I'M FIT TO SEE YOUR DAUGHTER, DOC? IS THAT IT? THAT'S EXACTLY IT. STAY AWAY FROM HER. ARE YOU SPEAKING AS MY DOCTOR OR HER FATHER? BOTH, FRANKLY. ALL RIGHT, HONEY, LET'S GO. AH, PATIENTS ARE FUNNY, DANIEL TOPLER. YOU KNOW ME? THE DOCTORS KNOW ALL THE GUESTS. YA KNOW, WE HAVE TO CALL THEM THAT. GOD FORBID, WE CALL THEM PATIENTS. SIT DOWN. WHY ARE WE FUNNY, DOC? PLEASE. CALL ME DOCTOR. WHY FUNNY? ( chuckles ) FOR EXAMPLE, I HAVE THIS ONE... GUES WHO NEVER ARRIVES ON TIME. HE'S A CONTROL FREAK. COMING LATE IS A WAY OF SHOWING ME THAT HE CALLS THE SHOTS AROUND HERE. HAVE I JOINED THE MEDICAL STAFF? SO, AT OUR LAST MEETING, I SAY TO HIM WHEN HE COMES IN 20 MINUTES LATE, "YOU'RE A BIT TARDY. WHY DO YOU THINK THAT IS?" BY THE TEXTBOOK PROFESSIONAL WITH ALL THAT RIGMAROLE I LEARNED AT HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL. WHAT DID HE SAY? WHY, HE SAYS, "I'M NOT LATE AT ALL." THAT'S WHA THAT NUT SAYS. CAN YOU IMAGINE IT? WELL, SOME OF US HERE ARE IN NEED OF PSYCHIATRIC HELP, I'M TOLD. ( laughs ) THEN WHAT DID YOU SAY? YOU SEE? THAT'S WHAT I MEAN. HMM. YOU PATIENTS TAKE LIBERTIES. I'LL TELL YOU WHAT I SAID. "MY TIME HERE IS VALUABLE. "I CAN'T WASTE IT WAITING FOR HALF-WITS LIKE YOU TO WANDER IN WHEN THEY FEEL LIKE IT." THAT'S WHAT I SAID. PRETTY STRONG STUFF. NOW, THIS... THIS... PATIENT... UH, PATIENT SAYS... ( exhales loudly ) THIS PATIENT SAYS, "20 MINUTES IS NOTHIN'." SO I SAY TO HIM, "MAYBE 20 MINUTES IS NOTHIN' TO YOU, LARS, GODDAMN IT--" NEVER MET A LARS I DIDN'T LIKE. THE GOOD LORD JEHOVAH MADE THE EARTH IN SEVEN DAYS! - SIX, REALLY. - AND 20 MINUTES IS ENOUGH TIME TO FILL THE WATERS WITH FISHES AND MAKE THIS BREATH SINNER SCREAM. OR MY NAME ISN' DR. JACOB Q. BERNSTEIN. I'M GLAD I FOUND YOU, LARS. DANIEL, YOU'LL HAVE TO EXCUSE ME FOR A MOMENT. I HAVE TO HAVE A BRIEF CHA WITH THIS GUEST. SORRY I'M A BI TARDY, JACK. BUT I THINK I'M ONLY THAT'S ALL RIGHT, LARS. THAT'S ALL RIGHT. TWENTY MINUTES IS NOTHING, NOTHING. COME. ( rueful chuckling ) WOW! GOODY GOODY. RORSCHACH TEST. DO I GET TO LOOK A PICTURES OF VAGINAS? ( clears throat ) TELL ME THE FIRST THING THAT COMES TO YOUR MIND. SEX. FIRST YOU HAVE TO LOOK AT THE INKBLOT. IT WON'T CHANGE. IT'LL STILL BE SEX. LOOK, I AM TRYING TO HELP YOU. OKAY. ALL RIGHT. I'LL TRY TO BE GOOD. THANK YOU. WELL? WHICH PART OF THE PICTURE WOULD YOU LIKE ME TO X-RAY? DO YOU THINK THAT MAKES A DIFFERENCE? OBSERVING THE PROJECTION OF MY PERSONALITY ONTO THE PICTURE IS THE POINT OF THE TEST, IS IT NOT? YES, THAT'S CORRECT. OBVIOUSLY, YOU'VE BEEN DOING SOME READING ABOUT THE SUBJECT. WELL, THEN, ARE YOU INTERESTED IN THE ANAL PAR OF MY PERSONALITY, WHICH DEALS WITH ONE PORTION OF THE INKBLOT? PERHAPS I SHOULD FOCUS ON THE TERRIFYING SAVAGE FORMS ON THE LOWER HALF. THAT TELLS US IF I'M ALIENATED. JUST TELL ME WHA THE WHOLE PICTURE SAYS TO YOU, WOULD YOU PLEASE? IT'S A PORCUPINE. OH! AT LAST, SOME COOPERATION. AND WHAT IS THE PORCUPINE DOING? IT'S PLAYING WITH ITS VAGINA. ( grunting) WHAT A LAME EXCUSE TO INVITE HIM OVER SO SOON. I WOULD BE DELIGHTED, MY DEAR. I LOOK FORWARD TO DINING WITH YOU THIS EVENING AT 9:00. SOUNDS SO FORMAL AND OLD-FASHIONED. WHAT AN ASS I AM. I JUST WANNA THANK YOU FOR THE WONDERFUL LUNCH YESTERDAY. GOD! IT COULDN'T HAVE SOUNDED MORE LIKE A HIGH SCHOOL CRUSH. HE MUST THINK I'M AN OVERGROWN TEENAGER. MUST BE SOME SORT OF CHARITY CASE FOR ZOE. AN ACADEMIC ODDITY. PERFECT FOR RIDICULE. I'M SUCH A FOOL TO BE INFATUATED. ( knocking on door ) - COME IN. - ( door opens ) OOH LA LA! WHO MIGHT THIS BE? I DON'T KNOW, PROFESSOR. I THINK I MIGHT PREFER YOU IN YOUR COMFORTABLE TEACHING DUDS THAN THIS STYLISH TAILORED SUIT. I'D GLADLY WEAR ANYTHING THAT PLEASES YOU, DEAR ZOE. THIS BOTTLE IS FOR YOU. THANK YOU. I'VE BEEN SAVING THAT WINE FOR A SPECIAL OCCASION. IT'S FROM A VINEYARD ON SANTORINI ISLAND IN THE AEGEAN SEA JUST NORTH OF CRETE. BUT THE ISLAND'S ANCIENT NAME, CALISTA, SUITS YOU BETTER. AND WHY IS THAT, PROFESSOR? PLEASE, CALL ME BARRY. BECAUSE CALISTA MEANS "THE FAIREST ONE." OH, YOU'RE SO SWEET... BARRY. BUT I PROMISED TO SHOW YOU HOW TO USE YOUR FATHER'S TELESCOPE. THIS IS A GALAXY WITH A GLOBAL POSITIONING SYSTEM. AT NIGHT, YOU CAN SEE THE RINGS OF SATURN. DURING THE DAY, DAZZLING SUNSPOTS. IT HAS A PRECISION FRONT CORRECTOR LENS. YOU KNOW EVERYTHING. THAT'S THE M.I.T. NERD IN ME, ZOE. PAY NO ATTENTION. WITH A LENS LIKE THIS, THERE'S VIRTUALLY NO DISTORTION IN THE OPTICS. IS THERE ANYTHING YOU DON'T KNOW, BARRY? WHEN I LOOK AT YOU, ZOE, I REALIZE I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING AT ALL. All: DANDY DAN! MAYBE I'VE HAD ENOUGH OF THIS NONSENSE. WE HAVE SURPRISE FOR YOU. - HEY, DANDY DAN. - WHOA! - HELLO. - I LIKE YOUR JACKET. BETTER AND BETTER. THANK YOU. I THINK I LIKE YOUR JACKET BETTER OFF. OKAY. SOME PARTY. I THINK I'D LIKE THIS BETTER OFF, TOO. ( laughter ) I THINK YOU DESERVE A DRINK. - NO. - COME ON. Daniel: NO. NO! I DON'T WANT IT. CHARLOTTE, LAURA. WHAT A SURPRISE. - COME ON, JUST... - NO. - JUST A LITTLE SIP. - NO!! CATCH A RIDE HOME, CHARLIE. DID I THANK YOU FOR SAVING MY LIFE, BY THE WAY? YOUR DAD SAYS THE LITTLE BITTY RED ONES CAN BE FATAL WITH ALCOHOL. IT'S GOOD MATERIAL FOR MY NOVEL, EVEN IF IT COST ME MY FAVORITE BLOUSE. AND NOW, I FEAR, YOUR BRA AND UNDIES. THANK YOU, DR. BERNSTEIN, FOR SHOWING ME HOW DANNY IS DOING. HE'S MAKING MUCH BETTER PROGRESS THAN I'D HOPED FOR, MR. TOPLER. WOW! I SEE WHA YOU MEAN, DOCTOR. IS THAT PART OF THE TREATMENT? ( gasps ) NO, THAT'S NO PART OF THE TREATMENT. THAT'S MY DAUGHTER. I DON'T WANT YOU TO SEE DANIEL AGAIN EVER. WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING AT? ( line ringing ) - LAURA. - DAN. - I'M SORRY. - I'M SORRY. WHAT IF DADDY SENDS YOU TO PRISON? IT WOULDN'T BE PROFESSIONAL OF HIM TO TAKE HIS FEELINGS OU ON ME. AM I EVER GONNA SEE YOU AGAIN? TONIGHT, LOVER. I'M WRITING MY OWN STORY FOR A CHANGE. BUT TURN YOUR ALARM ON THIS TIME, DUMMY. ( laughs ) WHOO-HOO! SO HOW DO YOU KNOW THE DANDY MAN? THE DANDY MAN? THE STUD YOU STOLE FROM ME AT BRUCE'S. DAN TOPLER. THAT'S THE GUY YOU'VE BEEN STALKING? DANNY'S ALL YOURS, LAURA. I HAVE OTHER FISH TO FRY JUST NOW. WHAT HAPPENED, CHARLIE? DAN'S NOT UP TO YOUR LEVEL OF COMPETITION? - FOR NOW. - FOR NOW? MMM. I MIGHT NOT BE THROUGH WITH HIM JUST YET. AND YOU? ARE YOU STILL A CHASTE ALBEIT SMUTTY WRITER AFTER YOU DRAGGED THE DANDY MAN FROM ME? - NO. - OOH, START TO SHOVEL. I AM ALL EARS FOR THE DIRT. IT'S KIND OF EMBARRASSING. YOU KNOW DAN AS WELL AS I DO. EMBARRASSING SOUNDS STRANGE COMING FROM A NICE JEWISH GIRL WHO STRIPS IN FRON OF DRUGGIES AND DRAGS A HALF-NAKED MAN OUT THE DOOR. WE WENT TO HIS... PLACE. YES, GO ON. DID HE FUCK YOU? - CHARLIE, HOW CAN YOU TALK LIKE THAT? - OH, COME ON! YOU USE MY EVERY WORD IN YOUR NOVELS. FROM NOW ON, I AM WRITING STORIES WITH MATERIAL FROM MY OWN LIFE, NOT YOURS ANYMORE. BRUCE CALLED AND INVITED ME TO KEEP COMING TO AS MANY PARTIES AS I LIKE. I DON'T THINK THAT'S A GOOD IDEA, LAURA. THAT CROWD'S INTO HARD DRUGS, NO JUST DRINKING. - YOU PARTY WITH 'EM. - BUT I CAN PROTECT MYSELF. BRUCE INVITES LOWLIFES FOR ATMOSPHERE. IT AMUSES HIM TO HAVE GUYS LIKE PIROT AROUND, BUT THEY CAN BE DANGEROUS. DAN'S JUST A HARMLESS PREPPY BY COMPARISON. AND WHAT MAKES YOU SUCH AN EXPERT ON DANNY? I'M NOT AN EXPER ON HIM, LAURA. YOU'RE JEALOUS, BECAUSE HE WANTS ME AND NOT YOU. NOW HE'S THE INVINCIBLE ONE. NO MAN IS INVINCIBLE. YOU DIDN'T TELL ME YOU WERE CHARLOTTE'S LOVER, DAN. LAURA. MAYBE I SHOULD SEE IF SHE'S OKAY. THAT PSYCHO'S BEEN CHASING HER. YOU'RE A PATIEN HERE, REMEMBER, DAN? THIS ISN'T THE TEMPLE MEETINGS WHERE MY FATHER LETS YOU PRETEND TO BE A MEDICAL STUDENT. THEY HAVE PSYCHIATRISTS, REAL PSYCHIATRISTS, WHO CAN HELP HER. Girl: STOP FOLLOWING ME. WE'RE GONNA TALK ABOUT THIS. FOR ME, IT HAS TO BE NOW. I'LL BE RIGHT BACK, DREAMBOAT. WOULD YOU LIKE TO TALK ABOUT IT? I'M A DOCTOR. NO, LARS, SHE WOULDN'T. WOULD YOU TWO OLD GUYS JUST BEAT IT? Both: OLD GUYS? YOU'RE NOT EXACTLY ON THE OUTSIDE OF THIS ZOO LOOKIN' IN A GLASS WINDOW, ARE YOU, MY BOY? YOU BETTER DROP THAT DOCTOR CRAP, LARS. THEY'LL PUT YOU IN A REAL JAIL. I'M A REAL DOCTOR, YOUNG MAN. I TOLD YOU. A PSYCHOANALYST. SUCH HORSESHIT. A DAZED, DIRECTIONLESS DRUG ADDICT, WHO'S NEVER DONE A LICK OF WORK, KNOWS WHAT'S REAL? BUT, YOU KNOW, MANY PSYCHIATRISTS CHOOSE THEIR CAREERS TO SOLVE THEIR OWN PROBLEMS. JACK BERNSTEIN OFTEN ASKS MY ADVICE ABOUT CASES. GET A HOLD OF YOURSELF BEFORE YOU CRITICIZE ME, YOU JUNKIE. AT LEAST I'M A HAS-BEEN, NOT A NEVER-WERE LIKE YOU... DANDY MAN. ISN'T THA WHAT THEY CALL YOU? HELEN, THAT FRUITCAKE LARS CLAIMS HE'S A REAL SHRINK. FORMER CHIEF PSYCHIATRIS AT BELLEVUE. REALLY? WHAT HAPPENED? ONE DAY, HE WAS PICKED UP STANDING IN BLOOMINGDALE'S WINDOW. ( horns honking, people exclaiming ) ( siren approaching ) OH! OH, NO. - HI. - HEY. THESE ARE PICTURES OF MY EX-WIFE MILDRED. WHY SO MANY? I SET FIRE TO ONE EACH NIGHT, MAY SHE REST IN PEACE. WHEN DID SHE DIE? I'M STILL WAITING. ( laughter ) WELL, ON THAT NOTE, SUPPOSE WE DISCUSS DEPRESSION TONIGHT, ALL RIGHT? I GOT LAID OFF MY FIRST JOB AT A COLLEGE. I COULDN'T FIND WORK FOR MONTHS. I FELT LIKE A FAILURE. MY CONSULTING WITH LIVE FREE OR DIE CERTAINLY HELPED ME OVERCOME THE FEAR I HAD FOR MY UPCOMING SURGERY. WHO'S GONNA LEAD THE DISCUSSIONS DURING... WHILE YOU'RE RECUPERATING, JACK? DAN HAS VOLUNTEERED, IF IT'S ALL RIGH WITH YOU FELLAS. ( all agreeing ) - WHAT? - I THINK THAT'S GREAT, DAN. WE COULD USE SOME YOUNG BLOOD IN THESE MEETINGS. ( stammering ) THANKS FOR THE TOTALLY UNDESERVED VOTE OF CONFIDENCE, MEN. ( laughter ) SINCE MY OPERATION'S COMING UP PRETTY SOON, WHY DON'T YOU START TONIGHT, HUH? UH... DEPRESSION... UH, CAN HIT ANYONE AS WE GROW OLDER. ( chuckling ) OKAY, OKAY. I'M NO AS OLD AS YOU ARE. NOT BY HALF. YEAH, WE'RE NOT YOUNG AND HEALTHY ANYMORE. WELL, YOU'D BE SURPRISED. EVEN AT MY AGE... LIFE'S NOT EASY. I HAVE TO FORCE MYSELF TO GET OUT OF BED. YA KNOW? NOT GE DRAGGED DOWN BY NEGATIVE THOUGHTS. FIGURE OUT... WHY I SHOULD LIVE EACH DAY. I HAD DEPRESSION! WELL, THANK YOU FOR SHARING THAT, SAM. IS THAT OPERATION ON YOUR LEG GETTIN' YOU DOWN? I CAN'T WALK ANYWHERE WITHOUT THIS ANYMORE. I'M BORED. BORED TO DEATH. DO YOU SEE YOUR GRANDCHILDREN? I WISH I HAD GRANDCHILDREN. I'M JUST A LONELY BACHELOR NOW. WHY LONELY? I BE THERE'S PLENTY OF WOMEN WHO'D LIKE TO SHARE YOUR COMPANY. NOW THAT YOU MENTION IT, I DO SEE WOMEN LOOKIN' AT ME. YEAH. THEY WONDER WHAT'S KEEPING YOU FROM FALLING DOWN. YOU PUTZ. I SAW YOU READING. BEEN TRYING TO RAISE FUNDS FOR A NEW LIBRARY FOR OVER TWO YEARS NOW. THAT'S TOO BAD. A LIBRARY WOULD BE A GOOD PLACE FOR YOU TO MEET A WOMAN. IT'S A LITTLE SILLY, DON'T YOU THINK, FOR ME TO STAR DATING AGAIN? YOU KNOW, MORTY, I KNOW A VERY ATTRACTIVE SINGLE WOMAN, THE ATHLETIC DIRECTOR AT LIVE FREE OR DIE, LOOKIN' FOR A MAN LIKE YOU. - ATHLETIC, HUH? - OH, YEAH. I COULD INTRODUCE YOU. INTRODUCE ME, FOR CHRIST SAKE? FOR 40 YEARS, I'VE BEEN MAKING INTROS FOR OTHERS AS A CONSULTANT. IF A BABE WANTS TO GLOM A REAL MAN, I'M THE GUY. OKAY, SUIT YOURSELF. I'LL SEE YOU NEXT WEEK. WHENEVER. SOME ROTTEN FRIEND YOU ARE. ROTTEN IS WHA I DO BEST, OLD CHUM. WHAT SEEMS TO BE THE PROBLEM? WELL, LET'S START WITH ATTEMPTED MURDER WHEN YOU TRIED TO PLY ME WITH MARTINIS IN THE CASTLE CHAMBER UPSTAIRS LAST SATURDAY. WHY WOULD I MURDER YOU WHEN YOU'RE DOING SUCH A BONNIE GOOD JOB OF DOING IT YOURSELF? YOU SET ME UP, BRUCE. LAURA AND CHARLIE ARRIVING IN THE ROOM AT THE EXACT MOMEN I'M SET UP AS AN OBJECT OF RIDICULE FOR YOUR DRUGGIE HANGERS-ON. LAURA WASN' SUPPOSED TO BE HERE. NOT EVEN YOU, MY FRIEND, CAN TELL ME WHOM I CAN INVITE IN MY OWN HOME. SO WHAT'S YOUR COMPLAINT? I'M SURE YOU NAILED LAURA, WHO, BY THE WAY, LIES UPSTAIRS NEXT TO THE CHIPSTER WITH SEVERAL LINES IN HER NOSTRILS. - I WONDER IF HE'S DRILLED HER YET. - I'LL BREAK HIM IN HALF. DAN, DON'T DO ANYTHING STUPID. ( Laura giggling ) DANDY MAN. HOW'S TRICKS? DANDY MAN, YOU'RE A HELL OF A LOT STRONGER THAN ONE MIGHT THINK. WELL, CLARK KENT, I GUESS THAT MAKES ME LOIS LANE, HUH? GET DRESSED. DO I GET TO SEE THE ICE CASTLES LIKE IN SUPERMAN 3? SUPERMAN 2. WHY DON'T YOU COME OVER HERE AND PROVE YOU'RE A MAN OF STEEL. WHEN DID YOU GIVE UP READING THE NEW YORKER FOR HUSTLER? PUT YOUR DRESS ON. AH, SCREW YOU, DAN. YOU'RE NOT MY FATHER. WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN ALL THIS TIME IF YOU'RE SO DAMN HOT FOR ME? LET'S ASK YOUR FATHER THESE QUESTIONS RIGH NOW, WHY DON'T WE? SEE WHAT HE HAS TO SAY ABOUT HIS DAUGHTER SNIFFING BLOW. DON'T DO THAT. MY FATHER'S TOO ILL. IT WOULD KILL HIM. I'M GOING. WE'RE GOING. THIS IS OUR RELATIONSHIP? MARKET RESEARCH FOR THE GREAT AMERICAN NOVEL? "THE ARMED AND DANGEROUS POVERTY-STRICKEN BOY "COULDN'T WAIT TO RELIEVE HIS LUST. "HE FORCED HER INTO A NEARBY MOTEL "WHERE HE RAVISHES THE STUNNING BRALESS AND NEARLY UNCONSCIOUS AUTHOR." WELL, I AM... OOH! UNEMPLOYED, BUT I WOULDN' EXACTLY CALL MYSELF DESTITUTE, LAURA. AND WHO WANTS TO RAVISH WHO? RAVISH WHOM? AND GO GET YOUR OWN JOB IF YOU CAN. THIS IS NONE OF YOUR BUSINESS. YOU KNOW I'M CRAZY ABOUT YOU, DON'T YOU, LAURA? YOU ARE CRAZY. PERIOD. BUT NOT ONLY IN A BAD WAY. LET'S TALK. IS TALK THE FOUR-LETTER WORD YOU HAD IN MIND? DR. BERNSTEIN WAS TAKEN TO THE HOSPITAL. HE'S IN SEVERE PAIN. LET ME HAVE MY CAR KEYS, HELEN. DR.

ONE OF THE MEN PRODDED A PATIEN OF JACK BERNSTEIN'S ABOUT HIS PRIVATE LIFE. DANIEL TOPLER. I THINK YOU KNOW HIM. BARRY... HE DIDN'T MENTION HER LAST NAME, BUT SHE WAS A DELIRIOUSLY MAGICAL WOMAN NAMED CHARLOTTE.
