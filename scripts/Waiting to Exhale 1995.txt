Tell us those lies you're telling yourself, promises you know you won't keep. WOMAN 1: I don't believe in New Year's resolutions. They're stupid. - I Promise I will not spend.... WOMAN 2: No matter what John says... ...this year, I'm starting my catering business. WOMAN 3: If I do let Russell come back, I'll whip something on him so tough.... WOMAN 4: I'm gonna lose 10 pounds and eat right. Fifteen pounds. Okay, 35. I mean it. Thirty-five pounds. MAN: Do you know where you wanna be tonight? And where do you wanna be next year? Think about it. Because we're getting close to that final hour. So if you haven't finished those resolutions... ...you'd better jump it before it's too late. I've made mine. How about you? This is brand-new from the beautiful chante Moore, "wey U." K107. check it out. SAVANNAH: The deal is, the men in Denver are dead. No wonder I'm changing towns again. It's gotta be better in Phoenix. BERNADINE: I gotta pick up the babysitter... ...pick up my gown, stop and get John's tux. I'd clone myself, but I wouldn't have time for the surgery. ROBIN: I don't know why I always pick the wrong men to fall in love with. My weakness is pretty boys with big sticks. GLORIA: I don't know why Tarik has to spend New Year's Eve with his homeys. He sees them every day. Plus, there are gonna be all these drunk fools in the streets. He'd have more fun at home with me, watching videos. D.J.: Just want you to know that if you're searching... ...somewhere, there's a love for you. SAVANNAH: Here it is New Year's... ...and I'm geeked up for a blind date that's not even all that. Just some party this guy's voice invited my answering machine to... ...when got worn out playing phone tag. A long time ago, I asked God to send me a decent man. I got Robert, Cedric, Darrell and kenneth. God's got some serious explaining to do. So my prayers got more detailed. Like, how about some compassion? could he have a sense of purpose? A sense of integrity? could he listen? The truth is, most men are deaf. They prefer to guess what you need, but they don't guess worth shit. They lie without a conscience. what they're best at is convincing us we should feel desperate. Thank God I don't fall for that shit. If I had the nerve, I'd get me some real breasts. [PHONE RINGING] Oh, I know that's gotta be Mama. She's the onIy one that knows I'm staying in a hotel. I Iove you, Ma, but tonight.... I'll call you in the morning, Ma. BERNADINE: I do not feel like going to another one of these boring affairs. - Bernie? - Yes? Would you be terribly disappointed if we didn't go to the party tonight? crushed. What? I guess there's no appropriate time to tell you this, but... ...I'm going to the party, just not with you. - She-- - She? Yes. She doesn't wanna be alone tonight, and I was thinking, "Why should she be?" It's that bitch who keeps your books, isn't it? And you picked tonight to flaunt your whore... ...in front of all your business partners and your friends. - What are they supposed to think, John? - The truth. Finally, the truth. I'm leaving you for her. MAN OVER RADIO: This is a test of the Emergency Broadcast System. This is only a test. Don't worry... ...you can have the house, and you know I'll take care of my kids-- You wait a minute. I give you 11 fucking years of my life... ...and you're Ieaving me for a white woman? Would it be better if she were black? No, it'd be better if you were black! Thank you, Bernadine... ...for making this easier for me. I'll be back next week for my things. MAN: This concludes this test of the Emergency Broadcast System. D.J.: Allright, time to get your groove on. All night long. I don't believe I'm spending New year's Eve by myself. This is definitely a first. Finally gave up on Russell. A lying, sneaky, whorish Pisces! [WHIMPERS] Russell was so fine. Probably... ...every woman in America wanted to be with him... ...but you know what, Achey? Oh, I knew he was mine... ...till.... Till I found that half-slip in his gym bag. D.J.: Phone's ringing off the hook tonight... ...from women wondering where all the real men are. So for you fellas out there running the streets... ...looking for love in all the wrong places... ...there's something you should know. Love might be waiting right there at home. Ma, I wish you were going out tonight. I'm just fine, thank you. you coming in at a decent hour tonight. It's New year's Eve. Things don't jump off till midnight. you should praise God I'm letting you out at all, the grades you get. you best get busy. You're gonna be using Morse code to contact your girlfriends. I'm doing the best I can, so just ground me. Your father's coming on Tuesday. And? He's not my father, he's my daddy. There's a big damn difference. Watch your mouth. I see the bastard every two years. I'm supposed to get excited? You get excited. I can't believe this, man. Why she doing this? What is that supposed to mean? Where'd he sleep the last time he was here? Ma, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Ma, I'm sorry. Ma, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm really sorry. That's none of your business. I'm sorry. [BRANDT'S "SITTIN' UP IN My ROOM" PLAyS] D.J.: This is k107 broadcasting live from The Hermosa... ...and this is where the party's going down. Why are you sitting there when you could be in my room? Let Brandy tell you. check it out. k107. Excuse me, is anyone sitting here? No. Please join us. WOMAN: She has her nerve sitting down here. SAVANNAH: Hell, yeah. I'm single and desperate and have no morals... ...and when you turn... ...I'm gonna flirt my butt off and then take your man. I can't stand a woman like her. PIease. Savannah? - Lionel? Hi. - Hi. God, if this man isn't the one, at least let me dance till I sweat. - Would you like to dance? - I'd love to. All right. God, you look so beautifuI tonight. - Thanks. - I'm certainIy glad we finally met. You made it here safely, in one piece. Our answering machines almost moved in with each other. I'm glad we met too. [THE WHISPER'S "I'M GONNA MAKE YOU MY WIFE" PLAyS] You feel so good. Thank you, Jesus. And then I did it. I closed my eyes... ...and I exhaled.

So I guess you guys have heard, huh? - What? - Jhon Left Bernie. - What? - Uh-huh. And for a white girl. - You Lying. - For a white girl? Honey, if I'm lying, I'm flying. I saw her just the other night at the circle K, and she was a mess! Honey, her hair was in rollers. She had a funky old bathrobe on. - I had to take my girlfriend home. - Joseph, are you serious? - As a heart attack. - Be still... - ...I don't wanna burn your scalp. - Gloria, I toId you he was an asshole. -Excuse her, baby.

I mean, I got a master's degree in business... ...and there I was his secretary, his office manager and his computer! "No, Bernadine, you can't start your catering business this year. Why don't you wait a few years, huh? Don't start it right now. Wait one, two, three years... ...I need you to be the fucking background to my foreground!" [SOBBING] Seven thirty-two! Seven thirty-two! The number of times we made love! I remember when that bastard told me he was counting! Right after 51! I'll show you! Fuck me for not leaving your ass then! But the worst, oh, the fucking worst... ...was sending my kids to school with only two other black kids... ...become you don't want them to be improperly influenced! Well, guess what... ...you're the motherfucking improper influence! Get your shit-- Get your shit and get out! [DOORBELL CHIMING] Ma'am... ...were you aware that your car was on fire? Yes. Did you start this fire, ma'am? It's against the Iaw to burn anything except trash in your own yard. It is trash. This is a nice area. Luckily, a neighbor cared enough. The next time you wanna burn something.... It won't happen again. Michael and I work for the same company. He's just been promoted onto my marketing team. Michael was no Russell. I mean, he's not pretty, but he is available. Oh.... [MICHAEL CHUCKING] A Kodak moment. ROBIN: Michael had to be about a 38D. My brain was saying, "Put your hands anywhere else but on my body.

I gave him $20 for gas, which came to $7.18... ...and he didn't give me my change. My fantasy was to get myself a little piece. You know, get my feet wet in a new town. well, not exactly my feet. Hell, it's been five months... ...and he has gotten on my last nerve... ...but... ...I don't have to be in love with him to do it. Hell, my body needs this. Oh.... Lionel, baby, we've got all night.

Thank you for thinking of your children! - Everybody, out. - Yes, out. Out! You don't come into my office... ...and throw a tantrum because you can't finish what you started! What am I supposed to do for money? - I gave you the house. Now sell it! - I hate you! I'm really sorry to hear that, Bernadine. But I'm not pIaying games with you anymore. Who do you think started this damn company, huh? Let's not start that again. And now you think you can just take the money and run? Business hasn't been good for years. But don't worry. you'll get what's coming to you. Hell, I'm not worried. You, on the other hand, should be. Okay. Look. Let's not let this thing get any uglier than it already has.

He's a fucking queer! - My father's a fucking queer! - Stop it! I said, stop it! One thing's for sure, it ain't running in the family. Because, you know....

Huh? - Get out of my face. - Just let me-- You'd better get out of my face. This is something we should focus our attention on this quarter. This account comes up for renewal June 1. The worker's comp premium is about 1.5 million. The loss experience has been excellent. What does the engineering report show? It shows an active safety environment.

But I have to admit... ...I haven't seen anything as splendid as you since I've been here. Okay, hold on, now. Hold on. You don't have to give me that look. Look, I haven't seen the sun for four days now. I mean, it's been one meeting after the other after the other... ...and now, I'm finished... ...so I decided to come downstairs, have myseIf a drink... ...and in the morning... ...I look forward to returning home to my lovely wife. Salute. So why are you sitting here all alone? Okay. Wait now. You don't have to answer that. You don't know me. I mean, you don't know me from a can of paint. I'm all in your Kool-Aid and don't know the flavor-- - I'm getting a divorce, James. - Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. Yeah, well, it happens, huh? And, you know, it just occurred to me that... ...I've lost something that once meant everything... ...and it hurts... ...and right now, I'm just-- I'm really pissed about it. But you know what really gets me? I didn't have plan B. My marriage was supposed to last. So I guess that's why I'm here. I can tell you one thing. Yeah, what's that? Well, you are one brave woman. You're bad. - No. - Oh, yes. Oh, yes. - I hope you recognize that. - No, I don't really feel like that, James. Well, I mean, you're sitting here all alone... ...ain't a black person in sight, and you sitting here like everything is all right. You know, your makeup is flawless-- Oh, co-- That-- come on now. I mean, you've taken his best shot, and you're still here. - Splendid. - You just know me so well, huh? No, no, no, no. I don't know you. But I do know a fighter when I see one. And I could tell that... ...with one look in your eyes. What are you? A psychiatrist or something? No. No. I am a civil-rights attorney. My practice is in Washington, D.c. I'm going through something similar. My wife is dying... ...of breast cancer. Oh, I'm sorry. Sorry to hear that. It's.... Bernadine, have you ever watched someone dying? I tell you, I mean, watching her suffer just kills... ...a bit of me every day. And the worst part is that I can't help but remember all the plans we made. You know, like we were supposed to retire in St. Thomas. You know, out there by the beach. She loves the water. Get the coconut oil and rub it all over her. She is definiteIy.... I tell you, I just.... I just wish I couId have a piece of her that I couId keep safe, you know? Just something. Something more than a bunch of memories. Anyway.... you look like you're out. How about a...? A refill? - Yeah, okay. - Okay. She'll take another of whatever it is she got. - Scotch and soda. - Ooh.... I'm scared of you. [KNOCKING] Well, hello. Hello.

It's only three minutes long, but it is a start. KENNETH: That's good. That's real good. I'm proud of you. All right, let's cut the bull. Are you gonna talk to me for real? I have to apologize for thinking I can just pop back into your life... ...after all these years. Pop back? In my life? Yeah. I needed to see you. All right, you've seen me. Now I can leave. I can go. Oh, man. There's so many things I wanna say to you. Is that right? Things I've wanted to say ever since.... Well... ...ever since you dumped me. Dumped you? Can we revisit the real worId for a minute, Kenneth? - Yeah. - You stopped calling me. Oh, yeah, well, it took me a while to get the hint. - The hint? - Yeah. Well, what hint is that? you never called me... - I never called you.... - ...go anywhere. Not even once. Kenneth, you're the man. And that wasn't the nature of our relationship, and you know that. I know. The nature of our relationship was that I was in love with a woman... ...was too nice to hurt my feelings. You were in love with who? And what? Look... ...I know I'm married... ...and I Iove my daughter with all my heart. You see... ...her mother was five months pregnant when we married. Now, that was my choice. I went in with my eyes open... ...and I've lived with it for seven years now.

I'm still here. Nothing's wrong. How are things with you? Well, they cut my food stamps to $57 a month. How've you been getting by? What've you been eating? Oh, baby, see, I knew you would get upset... ...and I been trying to deal with it on my own. The check, it goes so fast, and things are so high nowadays. Ma, how much money do you have? Sixty-seven dollars. Ma, be down at Western Union first thing in the morning. Okay? Baby... ...you know, Kenneth called, and he said he's going to be trying... ...to come out there, with him filing forhis divorce and all. well, did he call you? No, no, he hasn't. Well, then pick up the phone and call him. Because, Ma, I just don't know. I don't know if I can trust him. Oh, girl, you're so crazy. Mama, do me a favor, okay? Yes? I don't care if it's a knitting class or a new girdle, anything. I don't care what it is... ...you just pick up the phone and you call me, okay? All right, baby. And only me, Ma. Only you, precious.

He knows what he wants. - Be proud you raised him that way. - I am proud. It's just.... - He's my baby. you don't understand. - I understand. I-- Why you telling me all this? I thought that since you been coming over, showing him how to fix things.... He's never known what it's like to have a father. You took him fishing. He looks up to you. I thought maybe you could talk some sense into him. It seems to me Tarik isn't the one needs to come to his senses. If you don't mind my saying so. Well, everybody's entitled to their own opinion. Good night. Gloria. Good night. It's getting late. I better.... Good night. Russell called and said he's leaving his wife for sure this time. Okay, so, what's taking him so long? Russell? Russell, what took you so long? RUSSELL: I wasn't gone that long. ROBIN: Well, what happened? RUSSELL: We talked. Well, I assumed that much. So... ...is she gonna sign the divorce papers... ...or what? You just don't decide to divorce somebody and sign on the dotted line. It doesn't work that way. I wish it did, but it doesn't. Why don't you get my pajamas. Pajamas? Now, that's the first time you ever asked for those. Russell, did you sleep with her? I can't take coming here... ...and being pressured about what I'm doing with my own wife. Well, you know we won't have very much time to spend together. [PHONE RINGING] Hello. TROy: what's happening, baby? It's Troy. - I can't talk right now. - What? Can't talk now? Look, why don't you just say something sexy to me, so I can go to sleep-- Who was that? Savannah.

[CHILDREN SCRAMING] So, what do you think, Robin? I've loved this man forever, and now that we've got another chance... ...I don't wanna blow it by making him think I don't have faith in him. Do you know what I mean? I mean, don't we hear this on Sally and Oprah every day? - That's what you sound like. - I know. Is that where you get advice? The TV? Well, you know, there was this one woman in your same situation. This man kept saying he was gonna leave too. She got her hopes all up and everything... ...quit her job, even moved to the city he lived in. Right after she got there... ...she found out she was three months pregnant. He ended up dumping the woman. He said his kids would be too hurt if he left now. So, what about the baby? So she had an abortion. She never, ever told a soul... ...not even her mama. Hmm. She never looked at men quite the same again. So he left his wife in the end, right? Take a wild guess, Savannah. What show was this on? Sorry... ...I've never been on Oprah. [COUGHING] Guess what I got. - Some tea. - Guess. Picture you drew for me? I don't know, honey. What is it? ONIKA: I got the mail, Ma. - Oh. Thank you. - You're welcome. I'll be right back, okay? Okay. ONIKA: Mama? JAMES: I've waited as long as I could to contact you. ONIKA: Mama, is "freak" a bad word? JAMES: I've been thinking about you a lot, Bernie. Every day. All the time. I'm embarrassed to even write that down... ...but it's true. Bernie, I fellin love in one night. Mama, I asked you a question. No, honey. No, it's not. JAMES: You know what's even harder for me to understand... ...is that what I feel for you... ...has never undercut the love Ihave for my wife. Now, how is that possible? ONIKA: Tabitha said it was a bad word. JAMES: I still watch her every day. So beautiful. So brave. I just wanna give her everything I've got in me. Every moment. It's not a nice word. JAMES: She's hanging on, fighting to be here for me... ...and when she sleeps, I cry... ...over how amazing she is... ...and how lucky I've been to have herin my life. can I say it? No. No. JAMES: You're the only person in this world I ever knew I could tell this to... ...and even if this never finds you... ...and we never speak again... ...you've changed my life. You know what inspiration is? It's someone who lets you know life will go on... ...and something beautiful can be waiting somewhere. Somewhere when you least expect it. Mama, what does it mean? BERNADINE: What does what mean? - "Freak." It means "weird." You let me say "weird." Why can't I say "freak"? - Because. ONIKA: Look, Mama. Huh? Look at you. What? ONIKA: God stopped crying. I don't think those are God's tears at all... ...just his way of making sure everything keeps growing. KENNETH: Hi, darling. I'm sorry I'm late. My daughter's had a 104 temperature for the past two days. - Really? - She's got the chickenpox. Oh, gosh. I mean, PauIa's been beeping me on the hour, every hour, all damn day. I toId her, all she had to do was give the girl an ice bath... - Right. - ..or rub her down with alcohol. - Hmm. - Jesus you'd think she had malaria. - So why'd you even come? - Why? Because you are the most important thing in my life. WAITER: Can I get you something to drink? - No, thanks, for me. KENNETH: A gin and tonic, please. One of these days, she won't have me around to bug about this shit. Hmm.... You know, every trip I make out here... ...I dread going home. The longer I think about it... ...the more I'm convinced that this is what I want to do... ...when the time is right. WAITER: Excuse me. - Thank you. I mean, it's more financial than anything right now... ...and there's still a lot of things to be worked out. I know if I left right now, it would be the wrong time for my daughter. She thinks she's having a baby sister. A baby? So we're going to have to wait a little bit longer than I expected. Yeah. But I know the kind of person that you are. You wanna do the right thing as much as I do. I do, Kenneth. I really do. You see, the more I think about it... ...the more I Iook at you... ...you look like... ...the scum of the fucking earth. You see, the good news is, Kenneth... ...is that I was never, ever in danger of you getting a divorce. Oh, no. I'm the lucky one. "The most important thing" in your life. Meaning you'll abandon your wife and your child... ...to get laid every chance I give you... ...and you think--. You think the brass ring... ...is some bogus promise to put me in Paula's shoes... ...so you can do the same fucking thing to me next year? It's pretty close to irresistibIe, lover man. What the hell's wrong with you? I mean, you and my wife working for the same fucking firm or something? You weren't this self-righteous when you were fucking my brains out. You weren't worrying about my poor wife then, were you? You're right. You're absolutely right, Kenneth. I couldn't see past what I wanted, so that made me an asshole... ...but the difference between you and me... ...is, I'm not anymore. - Wait a minute. Whoa, whoa, whoa. - What is it? Now, look, I'm sorry, but we need to talk about this some more. I mean, without all the anger. Look, I'm not mad. Really. Neither am I, baby. I'm not mad. And to prove it, the drinks are on you. Hey! Damn it! ASSISTANT: You have a phone call. Thanks, Edy. Excuse me for a sec. Hello. MOTHER: Have you lost your mind?! SAVANNAH: Ma? kenneth just called me and told me how simple you acted! He was actually crying! And men don't be crying over no woman unless they love them. How can you be so insensitive? SAVANNAH: could you excuse me? CREWMAN: No problem. First of all, Ma, I'm sick of you telling me how I should live my life... ...who you think I should love, marry. Ma, I'm sick of it! - DOn't you raise your voice at me! - Mama, I'm 33, and I live alone. Yeah. Tell me about it. And I have to accept the fact that I may live alone for the rest of my life. It ain't too late, Savannah. He's begging on his knees, and you letting him get away! Mama, do you hear me? I have a job. I have friends. Ma, I have interests that you don't even ask about... ...because only one thing counts with you. With any damn woman, unless they lying to themselves. Well, I'm being honest with myself, Ma. I'm smart, I work hard and I'm a good person. Ma, if I allowed myself to think like you, I guess I'd be a dead woman. Ma, you should be proud I'd rather live alone... ...than crawl up behind a two-timing loser like Kenneth! He's a good man, Savannah. A good man. He's just in a bad situation right now, and he's trying to get out of it. I tell you what, why don't you fucking marry him?! [PHONE RINGING] Ma, I was wrong to yell. I'm sorry. But I meant what I said about my life... ...but I didn't mean to disrespect you. I'll never do that again. It's all right, baby. It's all right. I just don't wanna see you end up like me. Alone. I know, Ma. And I Iove you. I love you too, sugar. I'll talk to you later. Bye.

I'm grateful to you, though, for opening my eyes. I miss you too. You wouldn't allow my fear of being alone... ...to get in the way of him growing up and doing what he has to do. I was so unfair to him. - No, no. - Yes, I was. No. You haven't been unfair to Tarik. You've been unfair to you. To us. It's like you don't feel you're worthy to have someone to love you. No, I....
