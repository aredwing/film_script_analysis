I'm sorry, Mr. Guttman, your wife passed away about a week ago. Ah. I'm sorry. Who are you? My name's Paula. I was Mrs. Guttman's nursing aide. Your family asked me to stay on for another week or two. Let's get some breakfast. You'll be feeling better after breakfast. Where are your shoes? Hold on, let me get you some slippers. Tell you what. Trade your hat for some slippers, okay? All right. Now come in. - Good morning, Zev. - Good morning. I hope you're not too hungry. Breakfast is crummy as usual. That's okay. I'm not too hungry. That's Cele. She was friends with your wife. I know who she is. I know who she is. Could you give us a minute, please? Oh, no problem... Max. You don't have to tell me everyone's name. Tonight is the last night sitting shiva for Ruth, yes? Do you remember what you said you would do when Ruth died? No. It's okay. It's okay. 'Pa- wrote everything down so you... could remember. (coughs) Come on, Mr. Rosenbaum. (continues coughing) (all praying) Darling. Do you know when this picture was taken? It's from their wedding day. Did you meet nanny in Germany? Uh, no, no. I met her in America. I met her... Coney... - Coney Island. - Yeah. Why don't you show this to your brother, eh? Adam, look at this! Here. Put this away in your pocket. Now, stand up. Tell everyone you're tired, and go read it alone. Alone. You're tired. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Good. Forgive me, I... I'm a little tired, I think I should go to bed. Yeah. Okay, Dad. It's been a long week. Yeah. (door creaking) (door closing) - Penn Station, right? - Yeah. (conductor): Last call! 49 Lake Shore Limited! Last call! Last call, 49 Lake Shore Limited! (sighing) ls that your mother? Yeah. She's not coming with you? No. I'm going to see my dad. Oh. So, you're traveling all alone? I'm not alone. My brothers are right over there. On? Oh, I see. Are you going to Cleveland too? Yeah. Why don't you fly? It's faster. I don't know. (Chuckles) That's not a good reason. (laughing) You're a real whipper snapper, aren't you? Why don't you fly to Cleveland? Three plane tickets is too expensive. That's what my mom and dad said. Well, that is a good reason. I don't fly because my friend told me to take the train in the letter he wrote to me. I guess that's a good reason, too. (chuckles) My name is Tyler. Nice to meet you, Tyler. My name's Zev. That's a strange name. In Hebrew, it means "Wolf." Cool! (Laughs) (Max): I have planned everything for you. You must follow these steps precisely. Cross them off as you accomplish each task. We've notified the police and they've issued a silver alert as well as a reverse 911 to the community, our... our staff is doing all that we can. It's upsetting. I just can't believe this is happening. I can't tell you how sorry we all are. We do our best to keep an eye on everybody, but... I'm sure you can understand. (woman): Is there anything we can do to help? Besides paying you to lose people? Does your father have a credit card? You can tell them to call you if he uses it. (scoffs) Listen. Your mother's nursing aid told me that your dad's been very confused lately. Yeah, yeah. That's because he has dementia. And that's why my mother brought them here in the first place. I understand that. However, it's very common after the death of a spouse for more signs of neurocognitive disorders to emerge. Have you noticed that your father's been having mood swings? And he rarely plays the piano anymore? I've noticed a few things, Charles. I guess we were... so busy with your mom that I just dismissed them. Let me reassure you, we'll have him back here before you know it. In these situations, people never wander too far. (bottles rattling) (thud) Ruth? Ruth? Adam? Where is your grandmother? Adam? Where is your grandmother? Were you talking to me, Zev? I asked you where your grandmother is. One is in New York. One is in Ohio. Where is your sister? I don't have a sister. Stop playing with that thing. Answer me. Are... are you okay, Zev? Where are we? We're on a train. To where? Cleveland. Cleveland? You're going to see a friend. What friend? The one who wrote you the letter in your pocket. Can I have my PSP back? Ruth is dead. Zev, I'm going to sit with my brothers for a little bit. - Excuse me. - Yeah? Hi. Uh... My son there said that you were sitting next to him on the train and that you seemed a little confused. Oh, yes, that. I'm sorry about that. Oh, no, no, no. There's no need to apologize. We... just want to make sure you're okay. Oh, yes, I'm okay. Thank you. I'm okay. Um... You need help getting somewhere? No, no. Someone will be meeting me here. My friend said that he had a... sign with my name on it. Okay. Well, we'll help you find him. The cars are just down here. Is your last name Guttman? Yeah. Looks like you're riding in style. (Tyler): Bye, Zev. Goodbye. Goodbye. Let's go, boys. - Mr. Guttman? - Yeah. Good. - Good evening. - Evening. How can I help you? My friend recommended your shop to me. Well, tell your friend we appreciate the recommendation. What are you looking to pick up? Oh... Something small. Sure thing. Okay. Can I see your driver's license? Yeah. Yeah... . okay- Beachwood. Nice town. Yes. But, um... We've moved. We live closer to my son. What are you doing with my license? I'm entering your information into the FBI background check database. Oh. What do they look for? A bunch of stuff. Whether you're a convicted felon, if you've been involved in a crime of violence, dishonorably discharged from the army, mentally competent. If you've got more than one DUI offense in the last five years, if you're a fugitive, or currently charged with a felony. Fugitive? Yeah, like, if you're running from the law. (chuckles) Do I look like I can run? (chuckles nervously) Uh, okay. Let me show you some of our smaller handguns. We got everything. SIG Sauers, 1911s, Glocks, single action, double action. Sir, do you know much about guns? Um... - No. Why? - It's all right. We get all types in here. Uh, okay. Beginners... usually go with a .22. It's light. Easy to use. Very little recoil. (muttering) I think that's what my friend suggested. Okay. In my opinion, you might as well get yourself a BB gun if you get a .22. Look, I'm not trying to give you the hard sell, but $500 more, you can get yourself a gun with real stopping power. Now this is a 9mm Glock 17. Glock? It is German, no? You're in the right neighborhood. Manufactured in Austria. That's the most popular law enforcement pistol in the world. Okay? It's got very little recoil so probably won't hurt your hand but it'll definitely hurt the intruder. Is it easy to use? I hope! Yeah, it's simple. Yeah, but... Would you mind, could you... write down the instructions for me? Uh, sure. I mean, I can show you how to use it. No, that would be good. But please, write it down for me. Sometimes I forget things. Yeah, we all do, right? That's no problem. Okay, you're good to go. I'll grab a pen, and um... write it all down for you. (gun clicking) - Mr. Guttman? - Guttman. Yeah... How did you know? Your friend called earlier and said you'd be arriving soon. Your room's all ready for you. We have you in... 125. Just down the hall. - How much do I owe? - It's all taken care of, including incidentals. Oh, and I booked your taxi for the morning, like your friend asked. Thank you. (phone ringing) - Hello? - Hello. - Zev? - Yeah. It's Max. I gave the hotel some instructions. Are you okay'? Yes, yes, I'm okay, Max. And you got the gun? Yeah, yeah. Good. Good. You know what to do. Just take care of yourself, yeah? You have a good night, Max. Good night, Zev. Ruth? Ruth? (bell dings) Ruth? Turn on the lights, please. It's dark in here. I can't... I can't see. (pen clicking) (doorbell rings) - Hello. - Hi. Is Rudy Kurlander home? Yeah. He is downstairs. (man laughing) (vacuum whirring) (laughing continues) (TV, indistinct) (laughing continues) Are you... Rudy Kurlander? Yes. I'm Rudy Kurlander. Who are you? Can you, uh... turn off the television? (turns off TV) - Do I know you? Now, please... stand by the window. Who are you? Stand by the window. I am not going to do anything until you tell me who you are and why you're here. Let us not argue. Just stand by the window. Now what? I need to see light on your face. - Turn your head. - Who are you? Don't yell. Please, don't yell. Do as I say. Turn your head. Are you German? Yeah. (German): You are also German? - Ja. How old are you? Eighty-eight. Were you in the German army? What did you do? - It is in the past. - English. Please, English. I do not like to speak German. It's seventy years ago. I was very young. Answer the question. Are you a Jew? Yeah. - Were you at Auschwitz? - No! We are too old for lies. I didn't know about Auschwitz until after the war. I was in North Africa. With General Rommel. - You have proof? - Yes. Over there. When I became a US citizen, the immigration officer asked me if I had ever associated with the Nazi government of Germany or worked at a concentration camp. I told the officer what I'll tell you. Yes, I served for my country. I was a soldier. I was a proud German and that's what the men did. I'm still proud of my service. That's Rommel. As far as the Jews... I didn't care about the Jews. I thought Hitler was right. They caused many problems for the country. I thought we were deporting them or putting them in work camps... Not what they did. It was shameful, but that was not me. (phone ringing) - Hello? - Ls this Max? Yes. This is Zev. Uh... It was... not him. - Are you sure? - Yeah, I'm sure. Then you must go on. You must do what you said you would. There have been rumors for years that a number of Auschwitz SS officers stole the identities of executed prisoners near the end of the war. Shortly after my stroke, evidence was found that an Auschwitz Blockfuhrer emigrated from Germany in the 1940s and was most likely living under the name. Rudy Kurlander. The Simon Wiesenthal Center has found four Rudy Kurlanders who emigrated during that period. However, there is not enough proof to arrest any of them. His real name is Otto Wallisch. You must find him. (Charles): I'm looking for my father. He's almost 90 years old. His name is Zev. I'm looking for my father. He's 90 years old. He went wandering a few days ago. His name is Zev Guttman. I don't know if he has any identification on him, or... I don't even know if he remembers his name. I've been wondering if anybody has been brought into the hospital. Do you not think I've already called the police? (PA): Ladies and gentlemen, we're approaching the Canadian border, at which point, we're all gonna have to get off the bus for inspection. If you can have your passports and any travel documents ready, it'll make the process a lot faster. Thank you. (dog panting) (dog growls) Declaration card? Purpose of your trip? To see a friend. What's your friend's name? - Rudy Kurlander. - Where does he live? Foyer Des... Foyer... - Can I see that? - Yeah, of course. - Foyer Des Pionniers Nursing Home? - Yeah. And you'll be staying at the Queen's Motel in Hearst, Ontario? That's right. How long will you be in Canada? Two nights. Maybe. Passport? Sir, your passport's expired. - It is? - Yeah. Do you have a driver's license? Oh, of course. Hang on a second. Alright, you're good to go. But, sir, renew your passport. (Zev chuckles) I didn't think it was necessary at my age. Have fun with your friend. Thank you. Excuse me. How can I help you, sir? Rudy Kurlander. Which room is he in? Kurlander? Yes, Kurlander. He's in room 238. Just go down this hallway and take the elevators. When you exit the elevator, make a left, then you take a right. 238 will be on your left. Did you get that? Why don't I just show you where your friend's room is? Thank you. (Zev clears throat) Uh... Are you Rudy Kurlander? Rudy Kurlander? Here. - Are you Rudy Kurlander? - Yeah. Are you German? Yes. Were you at Auschwitz? Yes. I was at Auschwitz. My whole family was murdered at Auschwitz. I'm so sorry. - You're... you're sorry- - Yeah. What you did is something you cannot apologize for. I swore I would kill the man responsible for the death of my family. You're Jewish? Homosexual. It is I who am sorry. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry! (sobbing) (piano playing) Moszkowski. You know Moszkowski? My old piano teacher used to say that the three greatest composers were Mendelssohn, Meyerbeer and Moszkowski. - Do you still play? - Oh... (chuckles) No. No, I don't know, I'm not sure! Well... Why don't you give it a try? Oh... Well... (exhales) Mendelssohn. Maybe. (Chuckles) (piano, humming) (piano music continues) (elevator bell dings) (indistinct chatter) Hello, sir. Welcome to Boise. Do you have a reservation? (muffled): I have a note that you need a taxi pickup at 8:00 am. So, we have our complimentary breakfast which starts at 6:00 a.m. And if you just head through the lobby to your left... Here, let me help you, okay? (stutters) There is one thing. I forgot to pack more clothes. - Extra clothes. - Oh! We can definitely help you out with that. So, there's a downtown shuttle that leaves every hour on the hour and it's going to drop you right off at the mall on North Milwaukee street. (muffled): You should be able to get everything you need there... Sir, would you like me to do that? Sir, are you okay? Would you like to head up to your room now? Okay. - Can I help you find anything? - Oh, yes. I want to buy a new shirt. We have a great deal on short-sleeve button downs. - Yeah? - Can I show you? - Thank you. - Yeah. You can always find the best deals at the end of the season. Oh, right. (alarm blaring) Excuse me, sir. You set off the alarm. I'm gonna have to check your bag. Oh. Do I look like a thief? Oh, it doesn't matter, sir, you set off the alarm. I've got to check your bag no matter what, so... There's the receipt. Oh, there's your problem right there. They left the security tag on. I'll have to check your other bag too, sir. Is that a Glock? Yeah. (chuckles) Reminds me of my first gun. (bag zipping) You have a good day, sir. There you go. Thanks very much. Thank you. Thank you... (elevator bell dings) (scattered applause) (coughing) (breathing shakily) (coughing) (woman): Would you like a refill? - Yes. Thank you. - You're very welcome. (children screaming) Could you tell me how far is Bruneau is from here? I've never actually been to Bruneau, but it's in Owyhee County, so, I'd say that should probably take you about 30, 40 minutes or so. - Oh. - I heard it's beautiful country down there. I never get to go but my friends... (children screaming) - on! - Ah. Oh, I'm so sorry! I got coffee on your letter. Oh, God. No, you're ruining my letter! - No, no, no! - I'm sorry. This letter is very important! Stop! Stop! Stop! (hair dryer whirring) "Besides me," "you are the only person" "who can still recognize" "the face of the man" "who murdered our families." (dog barking) (knocking on door) (dog continues barking) - Nobody's home? - No. You want me to take you somewhere else? - No, no, no. I will wait. - Here. Give me a call whenever you want me to come back and get you. What do I owe you? Oh, you already paid me, remember? Just call me if you need a ride later. (siren wailing in distance) (explosion) (dog barking) Morning. Morning to you too, sweetie. (dog continues barking) Yeah... Dinner time, Mr. Rosenbaum. Uh... Bring me back some food, yeah? Are you sure? You haven't been outside the apartment all day. - Yes. - Okay. (sighs) Can I help you with something? I'm looking for Rudy Kurlander. Well, you came to the right place but, uh... My old man passed away about three months ago. Oh, I didn't know this. I am so sorry. Hmm... How long have you been waiting here? All day. You want a drink? A drink would be nice. Come on in. I could use another drink myself. (chuckles) - Thank you. - Beer or a water? Just water, please. Oh, Eva. Good girl. Good girl. Listen, I am a little scared of dogs. Eva's all bark and no bite. Come on in. But I'm sure that's true but I'm... I'm quite scared. Oh, I'll put her away for you. Okay. Here we go. Good girl. Quiet, girl. Eva! Eva, shush, quiet. (shushing) Girl, quiet. Calm down, Eva. Shush. Eva, shush. Shush. Eva, calm down now. Calm down. (indistinct chatter) Quiet! (Door closing) (sighs) (explosion) That's my, urn, kid's graduation. Dad always loved that photo. - I'm gonna get... grab your water for you. - Yeah. When was that taken? Your father looks so young. That was, uh, in 1997. - Oh. - Yeah. Dad aged well, didn't he? He always said that he was one of the Kurlanders with good genes. Here you go. (Zev sighing) Oh, you were thirstier than Eva. (chuckles) - Another one? - Oh, please. And then I won't bother you again. Oh, no, no. It's no bother at all. Stay as long as you like. Ever since, uh... since Dad died, it's been pretty lonely out here. You know, I'm just driving around doing my rounds, with nothing but the radio and the occasional dispatch. (dog barking) It's good to have someone to talk to when I come home. Eva's great and all, but not much for conversation. Here's your water. You're not married? No, no. Have a seat. I was, you know, twice. The first one, uh, took my house, the second one left before... (sighs) the quarry takes this one. (laughing) That was... Ooh, hell, seven years already. I wouldn't mind getting another one, but Bruneau ain't exactly the best singles scene and, well, I ain't exactly the best single. (chuckling) Did your father ever talk to you about Germany? Are you kidding me? He never stopped talking about Germany. Did he ever speak to you about the war? Of course. You know he was a collector, right? Ah. I got a bunch of his stuff. You wanna go take a look? Yeah. Watch your step. Just come down here. (clears throat) (sirens wailing in distance) (explosion) (dog barking) (shushing) Eva, quiet! Eva, shh. Hey, listen, uh, it's kind of a mess in here. Let me just move some boxes and I'll... I'll let you in the other room. (indistinct chatter) (grunts) Here we go. There we go. There. Come on. Oh! Come on in. That was, uh... that was Dad's pride and joy. The dealer he bought it from swore it was flying in Berlin on November 19, 1938. Kristallnacht. Kristallnacht. . . Yeah. Dad used to say that that flag, um, witnessed the beginning of history. You know? - What is in these boxes? - Uh, just... a bunch more of Dad's prize pieces. You know? I already sold most of the collection but, uh, these are the things he was sentimental about. Just haven't been able to let myself get rid of 'em, you know? You wanna look around? You wanna look around? - Thank you. - Yeah. Yeah, that was a first printing. A guy offered me six grand for it but I just... just couldn't part with it. I guess I'm just as sentimental as my old man, huh? (chuckles) You're welcome to look around at... at anything you like. I'm just gonna give Eva her dinner. (Eva barking) Quiet! Shh! Priceless, right? Yeah. I guess I shouldn't leave it stuffed in a box like that. (sniffling) (sighing) You want another drink? Yes. That would be good. More water, or something a little stronger? Maybe something a little stronger. All right. Now you're speaking my language. (chuckles) Yeah... To Dad. (glasses tinkling) You know, my dad was, uh... My dad was there that night. - What night was that? - Um, Kristal... - Kristallnacht. - Yeah. Kristallnacht. Yeah, he said he had a hammer and he broke a bunch of jewelry store windows. He ever tell you that story? No. No? (Chuckles) I so wish you were here when he was still alive. You know, every once in a while, some of his buddies would come by and they'd just sit around, tell stories, drink, you know? He loved to talk about the old days. You okay? You're sweating there. - Oh, I feel a little hot. Yes. - Well, take your jacket off. Come here. Mmm. Yeah, take your jacket off and, hey, I just want to tell you something. - You are more than welcome... - Oh. To spend the night if you like, if you don't mind sleeping in dad's old bed. - You're very kind. No, thank you. - No, no. Well, all right, the offer's on the table. Oh, thank you. Any friend of Dad's is a friend of mine. (chuckles) (stutters): How'd you know him? Did you serve with my dad? - No. - Well, how did you know him then? I knew him from Auschwitz. (laughing) Auschwitz? My dad wished he served at Auschwitz. You mean your father was not at Auschwitz? What are you... Are you serious? My dad was a cook in the army. He was not a Blockfuhrer? I don't even know what that is. No, my dad was 10 when the war started. Most that the Germans let him do was, you know, break a bunch of windows and cook some Wiener Schnitzel, you know? I am sorry to have bothered you. I have the wrong Rudy Kurlander. No, no, no. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Wait a minute, you were at Auschwitz? - Oh. - None of my dad's buddies served at a camp. I must leave you now. I have bothered you enough. Bothered me? No, no, no. Please stay. Please stay. Share some stories. I'll grab another bottle. We'll just... What's that? What is that? What the fuck is that? Well... I'm sorry. I... I, uh... What the fuck is that? Are you a Jew? Yeah. You're a Jew? What the fuck's going on here? I'm sorry, I... Sit the fuck down. Please, let me go. What the fuck are you doing in my house? I made a mistake. Your father is the wrong man. My father? You said you were a friend of my dad. You lied to me. - I did not lie. I did not lie! - Jesus fucking Christ. You said you were a friend of my dad, you come into my house and you drink my fucking whiskey, and you're a dirty fucking Jew. (Eva barking) Eva, shut the fuck up! Stop yelling! Please, stop yelling! I will go. Sit the fuck down! You gotta answer some questions right fucking now! Holy shit! Did you just piss on my couch? - I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. - What the fuck? Stop yelling! (screams) Eva, shut the fuck up! Are you giving me a fucking order, Jew? Eva, I said, "Shut the fuck up!" You know... you know what my dad would say if he knew a fucking Jew was in his house, huh? He would say, "Heil fucking Hitler." That's what he'd say. Yeah. Heil fucking Hitler! Heil Hitler! Heil Hitler! Heil Hitler! Heil Hitler, you fucking Jew! Eva, goddamn it, shut the fuck up! Shut up! What's your problem? Huh? Shut up! Stop it! Eva, quiet! Eva! ( Eva growling) Damn it, shut up! Shut up, damn it! Quiet! Eva, settle down. You want to meet a real life fucking Jew? Huh? Huh? Huh? Go get him. (gunshot) - Ah! (Eva whimpering) What the... (gunshot) (grunts) You fucking kike! You fucking... (gunshot) (sighs) Oh... (explosion) (phone ringing) You've reached John Kurlander. Leave me a message. Or if it's an emergency, call my cell phone. (answering machine beeps) Ruth? (woman): Where you at, John? You're a half hour late and I can't cover your ass all morning. I swear, you best be having car trouble... What are you saying? (answering machine beeps) (rain pattering) (phone ringing) (sirens wailing in distance) (explosion) My God. Oh... (siren wailing in distance) (phone ringing) Hello. - Max, it's Zev. - Where have you been? I killed a man. Uh... Now is the hardest part. You must call the police. You must... No, no! He was not the man we are looking for. - Who was he? - It was a much younger man. I, uh... I saw his name on a box. It was John Kurlander. He is a Nazi. - How do you know this? - There were many Nazi things - in the house. Many things. - Oh. This is not what we set out to do. Zev. Do you want to continue? Yes, I must finish. I must. After all, this is the man who killed our families. (indistinct announcement on PA system) Ruth? Ruth? (car horns honking) Ruth! (Brakes screeching) (groaning) (groaning) (cell phone ringing) Hello. Yes. Oh, my God. Thank you. Thank you so much. Is he okay? No, he has dementia. Mm-hmm. I'm sorry. Uh... Where are you calling from? I can be there right away. Reno Memorial Hospital? Reno, Nevada? Reno? Is it possible that I could speak with my father? (stammers) Yeah, thank you. Thank you very much. Guys, I gotta sneeze. (Sneezing) (screaming and grunting) (laughing) (phone ringing) Hello. Oh, hello, Charles. Yeah. Yeah, no, I'm fine. I'm fine. Thank you. I told the doctors not to bother you. Huh? Please, don't you worry about me. No. No. No. Don't you come to the hospital. Your mother will pick me up. Maybe you come with her, huh? Yeah, I'm fine. I'm fine. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Goodbye. Goodbye. (all panting) (laughing) Do you like cartoons? I like Disney Channel. - Mickey Mouse? - No. I like Phineas and Ferb. Oh. (Knock on window) I never heard of them. I'll be right back, Molly. You finish your homework please. (Zev sighing) - Your name is Molly? - Molly Elizabeth. Do you like sweets, Molly Elizabeth? Well, uh... I think there are some caramels in my coat pocket. I always keep some there for my grandchildren. Ah. I can't find any. Well, my wife will bring some when she comes. - Are you Zev? - Yes. Can I open your letter? Uh-huh. - Whoa, you're rich! - What? Who's Max? Max? I'm not sure. Wait. Why don't you read the letter to me out loud? "Zev, there are some difficult things you must know." "Firstly, Ruth has passed away." "She had cancer." "She loved you and you were with her, holding her hand, at the end." "Secondly, you have dementia." "Recently you have been forgetting many things." That's normal. Old people always forget things. Yeah. Yeah. "You and I have a similar history. "We are both Auschwitz... - Auschwitz. Auschwitz. - "Auschwitz survivors." "Look at your left arm, you were prisoner 98814." "When the war ended," "I promised myself." "I would find the men responsible." "Working with Simon Wiesenthal," "I have helped to capture dozens of former Nazis" "all around the world." - What's a Nazi? - Nazi. Nazi. A bad person. (Max): Six months ago, God smiled upon me when you moved to the senior housing community. I immediately recognized you from Auschwitz, although you did not remember me. We are the last living survivors from our prison block. Besides me, you are the only person who could still recognize the face of the man who murdered our families. Simon Wiesenthal insisted that all war criminals be given public trials. However, we cannot give Wallisch that opportunity. Even if there was enough proof, he, like us, would probably die before he could be extradited to Germany. We have agreed that Otto Wallisch must die. You must kill him. (Molly): "You promised to go once Ruth died." "You promised me and you promised Ruth." You did a very good job. Thanks. Who's Ruth? My wife. I thought she was bringing me candy. I thought so, too. Yes, I need to go to Holiday Inn Express 3961 Lake Tahoe Boulevard. - South Lake? - Yeah. That's over an hour away. - Oh, that's... I have money. - Hop in. (phone ringing) - Hello. Zev? - Yeah. (exhales deeply) - Thank God. Where are you? Zev? Tahoe. You understand what you must do? There's only one left. Yeah, I understand... what I must do. - Morning. - Good morning. I'd like to check out, please. Thank you. - You hurt your hand? - Oh, yes, yes. It's... Well, I can move. Good. Okay, that'll be $106.20. I think I will have enough money for the taxi. Oh, uh, we take credit cards, too. Yeah. Thank you. (Charles): Tahoe? What the heck is he doing in Tahoe? No, I'm just picking up a rental now and I guess I'll just drive up there. Yeah. Oh, look, can you try and find the name of the taxi company that picked him up? Thank you. (doorbell ringing) (Zev clears throat) Can I help you? Rudy Kurlander, he lives here? - Yes. - Can I speak with him? - He's still sleeping. - Oh. Well, could I wait for him to... wake up? It's important. What's this about? Well, it's private. And he knows me, he knows me. I knew him a long time ago. - Come on in. - Oh, thank you. Thank you. - Do you want a cup of coffee, Mr... - Guttman. Yes, coffee would be nice. Thank you. Uh, just black. Take a seat in the living room. I've got a pot brewing. That's from our family reunion a couple years ago. Oh. (Chuckles) You have a big family. My father likes to say he fielded a soccer team. (laughing) I'm his youngest. How old was your mother? She was a lot younger. It was his second marriage. - Thank you. - Can I ask you a question, Mr. Guttman? Does you being here have to do with Auschwitz? Yes. My father's not gonna want to talk about that. Oh. I understand. Would you like to join us for breakfast, Mr. Guttman? I'm making baked apple pancakes. I'm not very hungry. Thank you very much. I won't bother you for long. Are you sure? It's an old family recipe. Mmm. Yes, I am sure, but thank you just the same. If you'd excuse me, I am just going to run up and tell Dad you're here. Yeah, yeah. (Playing tune) (door opening) Uh, who are you? Oh, I am Zev. - Hi, Zev. - Inge. (continues playing tune) Who is that? Well, it's an old friend of your grandfather. You like Wagner? Yes. I have always loved Wagner. My daughter said someone I knew from Auschwitz was here. But a survivor should not like Wagner, no? (chuckles) You can't hate music. I, uh, didn't recognize your face in those pictures. But... (Speaking German) Your voice... has not changed. (German): I knew you would come to find me one day. Zev's your friend, Poppy? Inge, please go back into the kitchen. My friend and I need to discuss some things. I have not forgotten you. Please... let us go outside. I do not want my family to hear... what we have to say. It has been a long time... since anyone knew who I was. I cannot even remember when. Over the years people have looked at me and I think they know, but they never do. Or maybe they were just too scared to say anything. Sometimes, I come out here and speak my name. I talk to myself. I remind myself of who I was. It is the only way to know I existed... before I became who I am now. Well, living a lie is not a life. I always knew you would find me. It has been too long. We are old men now. Take your hands off of me, Otto. Excuse me? I said, "Take your hands off of me." (scoffs) - You called me Otto. I think you're confused. No, your name is Otto Wallisch. You were a Blockfuhrer at Auschwitz. And you killed my family. Are you crazy? You've lived a lie for so long you've convinced yourself it is true. ' L... I do not understand. Let me help you... understand. (doorbell ringing) It's like we're running a hotel. Go tell Pop-Pop breakfast is ready. Who is it? My name's Charles Guttman. I think my father's here. Hi, I'm so sorry to bother you, but I was told that a taxi dropped my dad off here a little while ago. Yeah, he's outside with my father. Thank God. (scoffs) He's been missing for a week. Missing? I had no idea. Come on. Thank you. - Dad? - Oh, my God. - Mommy? - Please do not be frightened. Don't be scared. Dad, why don't you, uh, lower the gun? - Charles? - Yeah. - What are you doing here? - Uh... Dad, put the gun down. - Put down the gun, Dad. - No. No. Not until he tells the truth. Why are you doing this? Tell them who you are. Please, stop this madness. Tell them what you did. - Leave them alone, please. - English! I beg you. I want them to understand what you're saying. (Kristin): Dad, what is he talking about? Do not listen to him. He is crazy! Ach so? (gasps) You have a very easy choice. You can tell the truth and she lives, or you can lie and watch her die. You have three seconds. - One. - Please stop. - Two. - Please, just shoot me. - Dad, stop it! - Three. Okay. Okay. (sobbing): Okay. (sniffling) During the war, I was not a prisoner. Louder. - During the war I was not a prisoner. - Louder! During the war I was not a prisoner! (sniffling) I was a Nazi. I was SS. I was a Blockfuhrer at Auschwitz. (Kristin): Did you kill people? Yes. - You killed people, Poppy? - How many people did you kill? I don't know. Many! - (Zev): And now tell them your real name. My name is... Kunibert Sturm. No. Your name is Wallisch! No, it's Kunibert Sturm. You are Otto Wallisch! No. You! You are Otto Wallisch! You're lying. (Scoffs) No. It's the first time I haven't lied in 70 years. You are Otto Wallisch. I am Kunibert Sturm. We were both Blockfuhrers. No... (stammers) I was a prisoner. Look at your arm. You are number 98814. I am 98813. We tattooed each other. It was our only way to escape. Dad? Is that true? No, it's all lies. It's all lies. (sniffling) It's not true. Lies? How could you forget? You took the name Zev because it means wolf. You said we were wolves! (speaking German) (gunshot) (gasps) (thudding) (Charles): Oh, my God. I remember. (Charles): Dad? Dad! (Gunshot) (reporter): Right now, we're still waiting to hear from the Lake Tahoe Police Department. They haven't spoken to reporters or released a statement just yet. But they have assured us that we will hear from them in some way within the hour. Residents, though, are, as you can imagine, just stunned. I've spoken to some people who do not want to comment on camera. I did speak to one, though, who told me that... - Poor Zev. - Tragic. Absolutely tragic. He couldn't have known what he was doing. He knew exactly what he was doing. What? What are you talking about, Max? The man he killed was named Kunibert Sturm. And Zev's name was Otto Wallisch. They were the men who... murdered my family.
