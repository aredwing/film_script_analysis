Well, look at this. - Read it, Uncle Bill. What does it say, Uncle Bill? Jim Europe would have been proud of you.' Signed, 'Ex-Drum Major, Noble Sissle.' Whos Jim Europe, Uncle Bill? Jim Europe? Why he had the greatest band in the world... Attached to the 15th Regiment. Didn't I never tell you that? No, Uncle Bill. Why, we was under fre for 191 days straight. Yes, sir. And our regiment was decorated with the Croix de Guerre. You don't say, Uncle Bill. Why, children, I remember when we come back from France in 1918... ...the fags was flying, people were cheering. Boy, I'm looking out for us. - What you got there? Book of telephone numbers I won from Joe. Boy, I'm gonna promote us a couple of gals... ...for the ball tonight. - How do you spell 'us'? 'U.S.' - You leave off the 'S'and worry about you. Every time you start to promoting, that spells trouble. Here we go again. Did you go to the ball that night? - We sure did. And did Gabe promote you a girl, Uncle Bill? No, he didn't... ...but he promoted everything else... ...a girl for himself, a big limousine and a chauffeur. We sure went there in style. This must be General Pershing coming. Can't be, because General Pershing's a blond. Well, boy, here we are, and I'm gonna Lindy Hop down. Boy, I'm gonna carry on. Come on, honey. Come back at 12:00, my man. Come on, honey. Yes, you. Cousin Jake, what you want this time? What you keep on calling me for? I'm sorry, Gabe. I can't come back and get you. Why? - The boss wants to use the car at 7:00. But, Cousin Jake, how we gonna get home? How'd you get uptown from the ship this morning? Walked. - Right there's your answer. I'm going to the powder room. - All right. Daddy, can I have a dollar for the maid? - Huh? Oh, sure. Sure, sure, honey. Here you are. Here you are. Right here. Go ahead. Man, you gonna brag yourself into the poor house yet. Well, I ain't got far to go. That just leaves $4.30 twixt me and it. I should have called one of them numbers in Joe's book for you. You see, the trouble with you is... What I mean is... ...when it comes to women, you just don't know, or else... Man, you're ramblin'. What hit you? Look at that gal standing over there. There's nothing like that in that book you was talking about. Better not be. Lieutenant Europe? Well, well. Selina Rogers. Hello, Jim. It's nice to see you back. I'm mighty happy to see you, honey. And how you've grown up. Say, Jim, I'm looking for Clem's buddy, Bill Williamson. Can you point him out to me? - I'm sure I can. He's bound to be around here somewhere. Come on. We'll find him. Okay. - I hear that you're a big star now. Yes, I'm doing nicely, thank you. I used to tell you you'd get there someday. Remember? You taught me my first song. I'm still singing it too. There's Bill Williamson now. Private Williamson. Attention. - Who, me? My ears hear something, but my feet don't believe it. Bill, this is Selina Rogers... Clem's little sister. - Who's sister? Clem's. - You don't mean Clem Rogers? Yes. - My. I didn't expect Clem's little sister to be so big. You two get together. I've got to get on back to work. Okay, Jim. - I'll see you kids later. I'm glad to meet you, Bill. Clem wrote me a lot about you. He told me a lot about you too. You know, I was gonna look you up. Here's something that he wanted you to have. It's the Croix de Guerre for bravery. Here I am, Daddy. My, what a big cigar. Yes, and a big man is smoking it too, honey. Honey, I does everything in a big way. It must have cost you a lot of money to keep... ...that car and chauffeur while you were at war. Chicken feed, honey, just chicken feed. You must be powerful rich. - Oh, I got a little. I got a little. Gardenias. Twenty-five cents. - Yes, indeed. Nothing too good for the little lady. Yes. My daddy does everything in a big way. Give me all of them. - All of them? I sure go for a guy that's free with his money. Do you, honey? That'll be $3.00. - Huh? It was very nice of you to tell me all this about Clem. Oh, that's all right. You want to dance, Selina? - I'd love to, soldier. Ooh, I never expected to have so many flowers till I was dead. Let's dance, Daddy. No, come on, let's sit down. Waiter, table for two. I've been marching all day. Anyway, there ain't no point in dancing. What are you gonna drink? - What you got? Just ginger ale and root beer. - What? You positive you ain't got nothing but ginger ale and root beer? That's all we got. - This is gonna spoil my whole evening... 'cause back in Paris, I didn't drink nothin' but champagne... ...the best of champagne. Well, now, maybe I'd be able to fix you up with a bottle of that. I got a friend on the outside. But it'll cost you plenty of money. - Oh, that's all right. Money's no object to us. Is it, Daddy? - Well, no. I'll see what I can do. - Yeah, here, boy. Come here. Come here. Don't knock yourself out. It ain't that important. Oh, he don't mind. I always wanted to taste that stuff. Well, honey, if you never tasted it, it might make you dizzy. That's what it's for, ain't it? - I'll do my best. But... I sure hope I'll be able to walk out of here without any trouble. Me too. Aw, that was swell. - I want you to meet Gabe. Who's Gabe? - Why, he was Clem's other buddy. There he is, right there. Come on over. You know, they called us the Three Musketeers of the A.E.F. Meet Selina Rogers, Clem's sister. I'm mighty proud. This is Miss Cynthenetta Webb. Say, this buddy of yours is a sharp dancer. He ought to be on the stage. Ought to be on the stage? Oh, by the way, Bill. I had the booking office on the phone this afternoon. Looks like you gonna play the Palace week after next, boy. Then you are on the stage. - Why... Yes, and he's his manager. He's gonna put me on the stage too. Really? Well, I don't usually bother with amateurs... ...but in this case... - Oh, Gabe, why don't you come up for air? Now listen to him, the most modest man in the whole world. Oh, let him go on, Bill. I'd like to hear more about you. You only got to ask anybody in show business. Take Bud Williams... He's crazy about Bill and me. Then you must know Chick Bailey. Chick Bailey. Do we know Chick Bailey? Why, we put him in show business. We're just like brothers, ain't we, Bill? Sure. Ladies and gentlemen. Presenting Miss Selina Rogers... ...one of our newest stars. Well, here's where we break in the new song, Selina. Okay. Miss Webb, Bill Williamson... ...this is my partner, Chick Bailey. - How do you do? You know Gabe, of course. - Gabe? Come on. - Who'd she say? He heard her... Chick Bailey. The guy he put in show business... his brother. But, honey, I can explain everything. - Don't explain nothing to me. I can see through it. The nerve. - But, baby... Trying to pull a trick like that. - Well, honey, I was only... And after all you've done for him. Why, the ingratitude. ## Trying to make out like he didn't even recognize you. # I may not be so very smart # # As far as books are concerned # # Where I leave off most people start # # But here's what Ive just learned # # There's no two ways about love # # It's true what they say about love # # Come what may, it's just that way # # There's no two ways about love # # When fate appears on the scene # # There's no betwixt and between # # There's no doubt You're in or out # # There's no two ways about love # # It comes right out of the blue # # Like a cyclone # # Sweeps you right off your feet # # Don't try to cut any corners # # You're heaven bound on a one-way street # # The schemes that you're dreamin' of # # Fit into your world like a glove # # Once you're hooked your goose is cooked # # There's no two ways about love # # It comes right out of the blue # # Like a cyclone # # Sweeps you right off your feet # # Don't try to cut any corners # # You're heaven bound on a one-way street # # The schemes you're dreamin' of # # Fit into your world like a glove # # Once you're hooked your goose is cooked # # There's no two ways about love # # There's no two ways about love ## What's the matter, sister? Don't you like music? Sure. But I like this better. Hmph. Here comes that Mr. Chick Bailey again. Gee, Selina, you were swell. - Thank you. Say, waiter. Same thing all around. And the party's on me, so see that I get the check. Oh, yes, sir. Oh, I wouldn't want you to do that. Oh, that's nothing. It's a pleasure. Well, I wouldn't argue over trivialities. How long you gonna stay in New York, Bill? I gotta leave town tonight. - That's an excellent idea. You see, I've got my old job waiting for me down in Memphis. Oh, but with the talent you've got, you should be a dancer. Oh, I only know a few steps I picked up myself. Yes, but you could work at it and learn. Couldn't he, Chick? Sure. They even teach elephants to dance. ## Ladies and gentlemen. The Cake Walk. Everybody join in. Come on, Selina. Let's try and win this cake. But this is our dance. - Tonight's the army's night, Chick. Wait a minute, waiter. Come on, let's dance, honey. But you said there was no point in dancing. - But there is now, baby. Why, you big blow-off Trying to show my daddy up. But you ain't foolin' nobody. Hmph. We got your number. - Your check, sir. Clem never told me you could sing like that, Selina. I couldn't when Clem went away... ...but I practiced, and I studied. I've always been ambitious. Haven't you, Bill? Never have been, except to get three square meals a day, regular. But I'm beginning to see things different now. Sorry youre going away, Bill. Oh, I'll be back. - When? Oh, when I get to be somebody. Man, there ain't nobody in the world... ...can get me on my feet again until we hit Memphis... ...unless this boat sinks. - I'm tired too. And if I never see a bale of cotton no more in life... ...that'll be too soon. What's that? Must be them traveling minstrel boys got on in New Orleans. # Oh, has you seen Miss Linda Brown # # She's the finest gal in town Turns all Memphis upside down # # Yeah, man, yeah, man # # She's a dark-eyed Dixie queen # # Boy, she got it and she got it mean # # 'Struttingest' gal I ever seen # # Yeah, man, yeah, man # # Now you should see her when she gets goin' # # Reminds you of the Mississippi fowin' # - Aw, you dog. # Think you boys is hot enough # # Yes, us boys is hot enough # # Well, come on boys, let's play the stuff# # Yeah, man, yeah, man # # I do a# # You can't do no # # Yes I can # # Yeah, man, yeah, man # # I can take a chorus too # # You can't take no chorus too # # Yes I can take a chorus too # # Yeah, man, yeah, man # # I can do some shuffin' too # # Look out man, what you gonna do? # # Look out, boys, he's comin' through # # Yeah, man, yeah, man # Boy, he got educated feetu.

Yeah. Just saw Chick Bailey. - Chick Bailey from Chicago? Yes. Been playin' in New Orleans. Just stopped on his way through. Comin' down Beale St. with a big party. Says he wants to put Fats for his new show at the Pickens Theater. Fats, you's now on your way to fame and fortune. Boys, smarten up. Let's put the best-lookin' one in front. That's me. - All right. So we can see the lighting effect in the drum. Hey, Ada, do I look better with the hat on or with it off? With or without, man, you leave me cold. Bill. - Yeah? Those tables... push them together. Here they come. I wish somebody would book me someplace. Hey, Chick Bailey. - Hello, Ada. Nice table right here for you. Round of drinks, and the best in the house. Well, Ada, let's hear that band of yours. All right, Fats, go to work. Well, all right then, boys, latch on. Come on. # No one to talk with # # All by myself # # No one to walk with # # But I might be on the shelf # # Ain't misbehavin' # # Savin' my love for you # # For you, for you, for you # # I know for certain # # The one I love # # I'm through with flirtin' # # It's you that I'm thinkin' of # # Ain't misbehavin' # # Savin' my love for you # # Like Jack Horner in the corner # # Dont go nowhere What do I care # # Your kisses # # Are worth waiting for # # Believe me # # I don't stay out late # - Well, uh...

Oh, that's all right. You're taking a liability off my hands. Why don't you fold up this joint? You know, I could use you in the show too. You could? - Sure could. Oh, boy. This joint is folding as of Saturday night. What? - Guess you're out of employment again. You're high and outside. I'm going to tell Fats. - Aren't you Bill Williamson? Sure you are. Hello, Selina. - Gee, I'm glad to see you. What are you doing down here? - Dancing. But on account of the bartender being sick... ...the cook had to take the bartender's place... ...the waiter took the cook's place... ...and I had to take the waiter's place. Gee, I'd love to see your act, Bill. - Oh, waiter. Bring me another pack of cigarettes, will ya? Yes, sir, boss. - Say, Chick. I want you to do me a favor. I want you to put Bill in the show. Doing what? - He's a terrific dancer. But, Selina, dancers are a nickel a dozen. Maybe so, but he was Clem's buddy. I want to help him if I can. All right, Selina. He's in. - Aw, thanks, Chick. Bill, how soon can you leave for Chicago? I'm on the outskirts of Peoria right now. Chick's gonna put you in the show. - Sure enough? Yep. I've got just the spot for you. I'm gonna put you right on top. And did he put you on top, Uncle Bill, like he said? He put me on top, all right. Hey, you, get your wig on. # There's a spot. I know a place they call Samoa by the Sea # # Talkin' there's not the most # # They palaver on the coast # # They command each other understand each other perfectly # # If you're feeling fancy-free # # If you don't give 'em repartee # # To win a tropical maiden # # Doesn't need topical talk # # You maneuver and if you approve her # # You can win her love in a walk # # Zulu man is feelin' blue Hear his heart beat a little tattoo # # Diga diga doo, diga doo doo Diga diga doo, diga doo # # You love me and I love you The idea's old but the method is new # # Diga diga doo, diga doo doo Diga diga doo, diga doo # # I'm so very diga diga doo by nature # # If you don't say diga diga to your mate you're gonna lose a papa # # So if you want to be in style way down on that tropical isle # # Say diga diga doo diga doo doo # # Diga diga doo, diga doo ## Gee, Selina, you were wonderful. How about a sandwich after the show? - That sounds swell to me, Bill. I'd love to. - Okay. I'll see you later. It's a date. - But you can't, Selina. I don't want her seen around those cheap lunchrooms. Don't be like that, Chick. - But it isn't good for the show... ...and I'm running the show. Yes, but after the show is over, I do as I please. We'll see about that. If you're thinking what's good for the show... ...why don't you let me go out and do my dance? What? Let you do your cheap hoofing in a classy show like this? Why, they'd walk out on you. Listen, Mr. Big Shot. The only reason they ain't walking out on you... ...is because it's raining out. Yeah? Well, if you want to stay in this show... ...just do your stuff on the drums, that's all. Just do your stuff on the drums. That's just what I'm gonna do. # Fire # # The low beating of the tom-toms # # The slow beating of the tom-toms # # Low, slow # # Slow, low # # Stirs your # # Blood # # Dance # # A night-veiled girl # # Whirls softly # # Into a circle # # Of light # # Whirls softly # # Slowly # # Like a wisp of smoke # # Around the fire # # And the tom-toms beat # What's he doing? - What's he doing? He's fixin' to tie the show up in knots. Look at 'em out there. They love it. Bill, you's out of employment again. And look at Chick. He's thinks he's wowing them. # Stirs # # Your # # Blood # # The tom-toms beat # # And the tom-toms beat # # And the low beating of the tom-toms # # Stirs your # # Blood## Boy, I've never known that number to go better. That's right. You were terrific. Come in. Well, he fired me. - Yes, I know. But I don't care. You know, I just had to do it, Selina. Well, I don't blame you, Bill. If it wasn't for making trouble for you... I'd hang a sign on that guy's eye... 'closed for the season.' Well, don't let me stop you. Does that invitation to a sandwich still go? It sure does. The lunchroom? That sounds like a great place to me. Come in. Say, didn't I tell you to get out of my theater? And didn't I tell you I'd get out when I get good and ready? Well, you're ready now. - That's right. Ready, willing and able. Come on, Selina. One never knows, do one? That's just like Chick. He ain't changed a bit. What happened after you socked him, Uncle Bill? Oh, we had our ups and downs... ...more downs than ups at first. Did you keep on dancing? Sure. That's when I invented that Bill Williamson step. You remember that, don't you, honey? - Yes. Come on, let me see if you can do it. You ready? Go. Why, you haven't forgotten it. You did that fine. What's this? - Well, well. Look at this. It looks like Gabe is still out of money. Just like my old man. What happened to Gabe, Uncle Bill? Oh, we kind of lost track of him for a few years. Did he quit promotin'? - Well, he did and he didn't. You see, I was trying to open a show in New York... ...and having a peck of a lot of trouble about money. I was walking down the street in Harlem that day. No, it ain't. - Yes, it is. Well, I'll be doggone. - How you doin'? Ain't doin' so bad. Thank you. Imagine me comin' here for a shine and finding you. Get right on up there, 'cause this one's on the house. Lord, I been reading about you. - Yeah? Yeah. Funny thing, I was coming down to catch the show tonight... ...and comin' back and ask for you. Oh, man, it don't look like there's gonna be no show. How come? All the chorus girls ganged up and refused to work... ...unless they get paid for last week's rehearsal. What? But if I could get open tonight, I'd be out in front. Well, how much money do you need? - I need exactly $ 560. Ain't you got that much in the box office? No, that's been attached for the costumes and scenery. Well, buddy, if that's all that's worrying you, your worries is over. You got yourself a new agent. You mean to tell me you got $560? No, I ain't got 560 cents, but I got an idea. I got ideas too, but what I need is money. Now, you listen to me. If you look prosperous and sweet-talk them gals... ...they'll be so busy figuring out how to make you spend what they think you got... ...that they ain't got no time to worry about how much money you ain't got. Look here, Gabe, what are you driving at? Just leave that to me. Leave it to me. You just go on back down to that theater... ...and tell them gals that Gabriel the angel is coming. You ain't gonna have no trouble stalling them gals, is you? Oh, no. I'll see you. - All right, buddy. I'll be out... My rent is due. - I need cash money. All you keep doing is flapping your big mouth. You say too much and you do too little. - Girls, girls, girls. Listen. The angel is on his way, and he'll be here any minute. Oh, we've heard that before. I guess that's old Gabriel blowing his horn now. Might be. Gabe. - Evening, William. Shake hands with Mr. Miller. - Mr. Miller. Girls, this is your new boss, Mr. Gabriel Tucker. He's even got an angel's name. - But he doesn't look the part. All right, everybody, inside. This way, Gabe. Okay, Willie. Wait a minute. - Where's the money? Ladies, after all. Let's do this in a businesslike manner. Let's proceed, William. - How do you like that? He looks like ready money. Well, let's take a chance. We ain't got nothin' to lose. Okay. Come on, girls. I've seen that guy somewhere before. Yeah? Come on, girls. Mr. Tucker has something to say to you. Ladies, I understand that there's a little matter of back salaries... ...which I am here to clear up. That's right. - Providing, of course... If I can see a little sample of what I'm putting my money into. Maybe I could give you an idea. Vamp me, Professor. Vamp me. All right. # Salt Lake City haunts me # # How that city taunts me # # Night and day I pine # # Salt Lake City on my mind # # Oh, I lost my sugar in Salt Lake City # # Oh, why did I go there # # I should have stayed down in New Orleans # # Never, never gone nowhere # # A gal with sweet talk # # From Kansas City # # Her words were sweet like wine # # She bought him diamonds and limousines # # Stole that man of mine # # When night comes creepin' # # For me, there's no sleepin' # # What he sows he'll be reapin' # # For he done me wrong # # Oh, how I cried my heart out in Salt Lake City # # The day I heard the news # # He left me deep in my solitude # # With the Salt Lake # # The Salt Lake City blues ## Ladies of the ensemble...

And henceforth, you will all receive a five-dollar raise. Why, it's Gabe, isn't it? Hello, Gabe. Oh, Selina, oh. - Selina, come here a minute, honey. I got something to tell you confidentially. Just a minute, Bill. I hardly recognized you in those clothes. Yeah, it's been a long time. - Oh, I should say it has. Not since the night of the ball in New York, when you pretended you knew Chick Bailey. Yeah, that was funny, but don't let me detain you. Come on, honey. You got to get dressed. Oh, and that big limousine, remember? Bill and I've laughed about it a hundred times. Haven't we, Bill? - Yeah. Yeah. Boy, call a half-hour. - But Mr. Williamson, we've got an hour yet. Listen, call a half-hour now, and call it loud. All right. Bill always said if you didn't have a nickel to your name, you'd still... Half-hour. Half-hour. - Come on, Selina. It's half-hour. But my watch must be slow. - It sure is. I know I've 'seed' that guy someplace before. Yeah? Where? I don't know. The face is familiar... ...but I can't recollect the surroundings I 'seed' it in. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Was it a pool room? No, no. - I thought it might give you a cue. A barber shop? No, no. Say, Cousin Jake. Do me a favor, please. - Well, what? Run outside and get me a box of candy. - Candy? You know, somethin' big and fancy. - Well, how big and how fancy? Well, do the best you can with three bucks, hear? Okay, okay, okay. Clear outta here. What's wrong with it? - I'd... Where'd you have it fixed? - I just had it worked on. Who worked on it? - The man that's got the garage... Well, he ain't no good. The man you want is the man... I had him. He's the one that ruined it. Well, I see you got plenty water, but is you outta gas? No, it ain't that. I think maybe it's... Oh, it couldn't be that. - Well, there ain't much wrong with it. What you need is some of them new gadgets. You know, the kind that you buy... I just bought some. - Oh, not them. I mean the kind what fastens where they fits. A whole dozen'll cost about... - That's too much money. I can't afford it. I got to get some that don't cost no more... You can't get 'em that cheap. Well, we can get the car fixed up good maybe for around... No, what you need... ...is a new car. - Yeah. The kind like my uncle had. He made a trip out... Did he go out there? Sure. - I thought all the time he was gonna go... He did, but not that time. - Well, what's he doin' now? Since he been back, he's been very busy gettin' ready for what he thinks... Is that so? - Sure. Well, I guess like all bachelors, he's... - No, no. Not him. He gonna get married. - He is? Yeah, he's gonna marry the widow whose husband used to be... She's a fine lady. - Mm-hmm. But listen... I heard that one time she... - That was her daughter. You see, I'm keeping company with her. You is? Yeah, I been engaged to her ever since the time... I didn't know you knowed her that long. - Sure. I worked with her brother. And one day on the job, the first thing I know... That was your fault. Now, what you should have done was... I did. - You see that? Now that why I like talk to you. - Yeah. 'Cause me and you can agree with one another. Sure. You know one thing. When I get the car fixed up... I'm gonna take you and your girl out for a ride sometime. That'll be great. Can you make it... - I'll be busy then. When can you make it? - Let's see. The best day for me will... That'll suits me. What hour? Anytime between... - That's a little early, but we'll be there. All right, I'll be seein' ya. - Later, bye-bye. Bon voy... That was awful nice of you, honey, to promise us a raise in salary. Oh, that's trivial, honey, trivial. I might even split my profits with you. - Oh, really? Wonderful. Oh, that's my man. Now, don't go away. I'll be right back in a second. Oh, that's swell. What... All of this for three bucks? The candy may be a little stale, but it's a nice box. Thank you. Thank you, Cousin Jake. Isn't he wonderful? Edna Mae, I believe you've taken a shine to that angel. Shine? Did you say shine? - Yes. Doggone it. I know I saw him somewhere. He's a bootblack. - Who? That angel. He ain't no angel. He's got a shinin' stand in Harlem. He shined my shoes a thousand times. - What? A bootblack? Come on, kids. - I'm so mad, I don't know what to do. Listen, girls. This is me, kiddies, Gabe. I've got a surprise for you. Come in, deary. We've got a surprise for you too. All right, honey. Now, here is somethin' for you. Now, this is... What's the matter? What's wrong? - I don't know. Girls. Girls. Just a minute. What are you all trying to do? What's the trouble in here? They can hear you out front. There's plenty of trouble. We're not going on till we get our money. But, girls, you've got to finish the show. If I have to give the people their money back tonight, I will be ruined. I'm ruined now. - He reminds me of... No. He looks worse than that. If it's money you all are worried about, I think I have the solution to your problem. Cousin Jake, where did you get all that money? I drove my boss to Belmont Park today. You mean, there was a coincident? - What you mean? That the right horse came in at the right time... ...and on the right track at the right odds? Yeah. - - As we live and breathe. # I can't give you anything but love # # Baby # # That's the only thing I've plenty of # # Baby # # Dream awhile, scheme awhile # # We're sure to find # # Happiness and I guess # # All those things you've always pined for # # Gee, I like to see you looking swell # # Baby # # Diamond bracelets Woolworth doesn't sell # # Baby # # Till that lucky day you know darn well # # Baby # # I can't give you anything but love # # Can't give you anything but love # # Love # # I left you love, baby # # That's the only thing I've plenty of, baby # # Dream awhile, scheme awhile # # You're sure to find # # Happiness and I guess # # And we guess # # All those things you've always pined for # # Baby, you're lookin' swell # # Do, do, do-do-do # # Baby # # Diamond and rings and jivin' things # # Woolworth doesn't sell them, baby # # Till that lucky day you know darn well # # Baby # # I can't give you anything but love # # I can't give you # # Anything but love ## When did you go to Hollywood, Uncle Bill? Honey, the first time I went to Hollywood was 1936. Did Miss Selina go with you? - No, she didn't go. How come? When two people can't seem the same thing the same way... ...life just gets powerful complicated. You see, honey, this is the living room... ...here's your room, and this is the nursery. Oh, that's swell, Bill. That's about the prettiest little house I ever saw. But not for us. - Why not for us? You know why not for us. We're show people, on the road day in and day out. We don't have time to live in a house like that. Sure, that's the way it's been up until now, honey. But... Oh, but Bill, we've been over this a thousand times. I know, but since I've got that Hollywood contract, we'll have plenty of money. You won't have to go on workin'. You can quit. - Quit? Sure. You worked long enough. It's time that you settled down. And we have a home and... But, Bill, I don't wanna quit. I wouldn't be happy unless I went on with my work, just like you. Singing's in my blood. I'm sorry, Selina. I just thought maybe you'd see it different now. Bill, I'm afraid I'll never see it differently. Never. I'm sorry too. Selina, then she went to Paris and got to be a big star over there. Didn't Miss Selina ever come back, Uncle Bill? Not yet. Cab Calloway. Hello, Cab. Hello, Pops. What's all of this? You never told me 'bout this jive. I wish they were mine. The neighbor's kids, just trying to show 'em a few steps. Run along, kids. See you later. Come over and sit down. Bill, I guess you ain't as lonesome out here as I thought. Yes, it's lonesome all right. But I hate to give up the place in case Selina... ...ever change her mind and wanna come back. But what are you doin' out here? - Oh. Tonight we givin' a big party at the Downtown Club for the soldiers. For the soldiers? Sure. A big blow-out before they go overseas. Bill, I want you to be there. You bet I'll be there. Anything for the soldiers. # Way down in Charleston lives old Geechy Joe # # Going way down to Charleston # # To dig old Geechy Joe # # Got a good old geechy urge # # Can't do nothin' else but go # # Got misery # # Misery I can't lose # # Got misery # # Nothin' but bad news # # Then I dig old Geechy Joe # # So he can voodoo those lonesome blues # # Gotta get back to Charleston # # If I have to walk down that rail road track # # Rub a hand on a lodestone # # Blue is black # # I fold Geechy Joe can get it # # I'm never, never, never, never, never, never, never # # Coming back # # Comin' home # # Geechy Joe # # Coming home ## Be like old times. Why, it ain't Gabe. - Well, if this ain't a solid send out. What do you know, Pop? Gimme some skin. Mellow. Now lay your racket, jack. Say, this cat ain't hep to the jive. Stop beatin' up your chops to him. Now, ain't that a bring-down. That's a wrong riff jack. Say, what the devil you two fools talkin' about? We're talkin' jive. He says he's glad to see you, and he wants to shake your hand. Solid. - Righteous. Crazy. Go along Cab. - Okay. Say, Bill. Come on. I want you to come out front and catch this next number. I'm quite sure that you'll get a great big kick out of it. - Really? Go ahead. - I'll see you. # Don't know why # # There's no sun up in the sky # # Stormy weather # # Since my man and I ain't together # # Keeps rainin' all the time # # Life is bare # # Gloom and misery everywhere # # Stormy weather # # Just can't get my poor self together # # I'm weary all the time # # The time # # So weary all the time # # Since he went away # # The blues walked in and met me # # If he stays away # # Old rockin' chair will get me # # All I do is pray the lord above will let me # # Walk in the sun once more # # Can't go on # # Everything I had is gone # # Stormy weather # # Since my man and I ain't together # # Keeps rainin' all the time # # Keeps rainin' all the time # # I'll walk around heavyhearted and sad # # Night comes around and I'm still feeling bad # # Rain pourin' down # # Blindin' every hope I had # # This pitterin', patterin' beatin' and scatterin' # # Drives me mad # # Love, love, love, love # # This misery # # Is just too much for me # # Can't go on # # Everything I had is gone # # Stormy weather # # Since my man and I ain't together # # Keeps rainin' all the time # # Keeps rainin' all # # The time # # Keeps rainin' all the time # # Keeps rainin' all the time # # Keeps rainin' all the time# #Stormy weather # # Keeps rainin' all the time # # Cant go on # # Everything I had is gone # # Stormy weather # # Since my man and I ain't together # # Keeps rainin' all the time # # Keeps rainin' all the time ## So you're goin' over, huh? - Yes, sir. And I hope to be with him soon. Oh, I envy your dad. I wished I had a boy like you. And so do I. Hello, Bill. Why, hello, Selina. Did I hear you say something? Yes, and I meant it too. - But you always... But a woman can change her mind. You hear that? 'We want Williamson.' Honey, you got him. - We want Williamson.
