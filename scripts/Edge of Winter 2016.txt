This is nothing. Guy back in September, he got tangled up in the bailer, took his whole arm off. - Cool. - No, it's not. The cast comes off next week. It'll be good as new. Oh. Oh, hey, you trying to break the other one? Uh, Ted says a firm handshake shows strong character. Oh, so that's been my problem all this time. How's this? How's this, huh? Oh! Hey! Stop it. Love what you've done with the place. Yeah. Feng shui and the motifs over there and everything. Maybe you should be a decorator. You have some spare time now. You know, Elliot, if you're interested, I could talk to my guys down at the warehouse, see if they could use a hand. I'm good. Thanks, Ted. Okay, come say good-bye. You ever go-- you ever go on any kind of cruise? It's not my thing. I don't want to be stuck on a boat with 2,000 rich assholes for a week. And that norovirus thing going around? What's that? It's killer diarrhea. It's just a stomach bug that we are not gonna get 'cause, you know, we wash our hands. All right, eat a vegetable at some point. Have a good one, big guy. You too. Yeah, see ya. Take care. Nice to see you. I'll just be a second. Hey. You sure you're good with this? My mom called again this morning, said she's more than happy to come and help if you need it. Jesus. Thanks for the vote of confidence, but I got this. All right. Love you. Bye, mom. Love you, too. Hey, so how are things with the two of you? Yeah, we're not doing this. I just don't get it. I know you don't. Have fun. All right. Now the party can start. This place is a lot smaller than your last place. So, where are we gonna sleep? I figured you guys could just take my bed, and I'll crash on the couch. He snores. At least I don't wet the bed. That was, like, three years ago. You're gonna figure it out. What do you want to do today? Anything, just not bowling again. He just doesn't want to go because he sucks. Shut up, Caleb. I always beat him. You have pancakes? We just ate. Yeah, but he's a growing boy. He needs to eat all the time. Go get your stuff put away, and I'll see if I can get you some pancakes, all right? Here. Put this over there. No, keep your crap on your side of the room. Idiot. Well, don't throw things at me then. What? Look at this. Holy... Give me that. What? It's loaded. Easy, easy. Give me it! How do you, like, put the bullets in it? What the fuck are you doing? Bradley-- no, I didn't. Shut up. You cannot play with this! Well, you shouldn't have left it out then. I didn't. It was under the bed! I'm sorry I yelled. You said "fuck." Caleb. Either of you ever-- ever shot one of these before? I was about your age when my dad taught me. What if I took you boys out? Really? Every man should know how to safely use and respect a gun. Mom would freak out. No, she won't. 'Cause she'll never know. Right? Yeah. Yeah, we could go up north to our old logging site. Get some fresh air, make men out of you boys. Ted sure as hell ain't going to. Yeah. Is that something you'd be into? Yeah. Say yes. Come on. Huh? Uh, yeah. Sure. All right. Okay, grab your coats. Yeah! Yes! Come on. Come on. There's some pop-tarts in the glove box if you guys are hungry. Do you know how much sugar is in those things? Yep. That's what makes them so damn delicious. Did your hand get stuck in the machine, too? Nope. It got stuck in my boss's face. Don't go telling your mom, but yeah. He thought he could just get away with firing everybody and replacing us with these damn robots. Right. So destroying the forest faster than ever. That's kinda the point. So you're not worried about killing the environment? "Killing the environment"? What, are you gonna stop using toilet paper? Are you going to stop breathing? The point is, you gotta stand up for what's right. You can't just let people push you around, you know? That-that's the way the world really works. Hey, mom. No, yeah, we're just, uh, learning how the world works. We're going for pancakes. Yeah. Don't worry. Yeah, we will. Okay. Okay, I love you, too. Bye. Ahh. Hey. All right, grab some snacks and, uh, whatever you want to drink. Here. These are for me. Uh-huh. And I'm gonna fill up the truck. Here. Oh, no, that's cool. Ted gave us a card for emergencies and stuff. Well, this is not an emergency. Take it. Here. How-- how much was it? Sixty-something. Sixty? What'd you guys get? You know, snacks and stuff. Shit. Where's my phone? Your precious phone is safe. You can't just take it. I want to spend some time with you. I don't want your phone to get all the attention. You'll get it back when we get home, okay? We close? Mm, not quite. Here we go. What? We came all this way. What are you doing? Do it. Do it! Do it! Do it! Do it! My hands are tied here. Everybody knows you can't refuse the "do it, do it" chant. Go! Go! Stop, dad! You can do it, dad. You can do it. That was awesome! That was crazy. Shit. Did that cop see us? What? You're such a dick. You totally went for it. I'd give you up. I'd give you up in a heartbeat. "I'm sorry, officer. I was just tryin' to get to church. This little one right here was doing the 'do it, do it, do it' chant." Wow. Welcome to my office. Cool. Man, I love it out here. I wish I could just move up here and live off the land. Yeah. Let's do it, huh? - No more responsibilities, no school. - I like school. Come on, nobody likes school. All right, have a seat. What's the first rule of gun safety? No drinking? Don't shoot anybody? Smart-asses. Yeah, that is absolutely the first rule: Don't shoot anyone. So, always keep the gun pointed downrange, and you keep the safety on until you're ready to fire, okay? And that's this little button right here. See the red? That means the safety's off, and it's ready to fire. So red, you're dead. "Red, you're dead." Cool. Okay. Ready to give it a shot? Yeah. Oldest first. Thanks. Pull the lever there. Yeah, and drop it in. Okay. Make sure it's seated. There you go. Snap it shut. Okay. Just shoot it anywhere? You gotta keep it snug. I thought you shot yourself! Oh, my god! I told you to keep it snug. All right, well, now we know that this isn't a toy, right? Where you going? You just gonna go off and cry about it? Guess it's my turn. Hey, have a damn sense of humor. Can you just give me a minute, please? Hey, what's the matter with you? It was him. This little guy right-- ooh-hoo-hoo! Ohh! You blame me for everything! You're ganging up on me with your cheap shots? Okay, that's how you wanna play? Hey! No! That's how you wanna play? Wait up! No! No, no, no, wait! I hit him! Winner! Winner! Winner! Caleb, stop! He's soaked! - Not funny. - Well, we're both laughing. We're just playing-- hey, come on. Come on, we were just playing around. Yeah, sorry. Hey. Brad. Want my coat? He'll be fine. Come on. All right! Brad, I hit it! Bradley! Come on out here! All right! Nice shot. Hey, can we go? I gotta use the bathroom. Go write your name in the snow. The whole world's your toilet. Want a sip? Yeah. You sure? Sure. You like it? It's not that bad. Huh? Dad let me have a sip of his beer. Great. You just gonna rat me out like that? Hey. Just hit the target once, and then we can go, all right? Okay. All right. Caleb, show him how it's done. Okay, so basically, you wanna widen your stance, and just mash it into, like, the squishy part of your shoulder. Hey. And you just line it-- hey. Shh. Hey. Look. Shh. Caleb, don't-- nice shot! Nice! Look at that. What, was I supposed to just let him suffer? What did you think was gonna happen? I didn't think I'd hit it. Jesus, you boys are soft. Fine, let's just-- let's just go. Let's go. You okay? You've been drinking. So? You drive. He doesn't have a license. He's gotta learn sometime. All right. So Ted never taught you? Like Ted would ever let him drive the car. You just go slow and keep it steady. You got this. Okay. And this... Release the hand brake. Okay. Slowly pull out. Whoa. There you go. Okay. Now you're driving. Okay. You're doing good. If you need to step on the brake, just press slowly on the brake. Don't step on it 'cause it's ice. It'll just skid. Okay. You're doing good. Thanks. You all right? Yeah, yeah. Sure you don't want me to take over? No, I'm good. I'm fine. He drives like a grandmother. Let me try. You couldn't see over the steering wheel. Hey, cut it out! Stop it. Hey, cut it out. Just quit it! Quit playin' around! Holy shit! Are you okay? Yeah. Sorry, I didn't-- I just-- i don't know... Oh, f-- fuck! Fucking told you not to play around! Shit. Dad? All right. All right, turn the ignition on. Put it in reverse. Okay. Give it some gas! Give it some gas. More! A little more! It's fine. It's fine. Are we stuck out here? What's the knife for? Now, you come with me, Caleb. Oh, shit! Okay. Awesome. Oh. Okay. Oh, fuck. Come on! Really jam it in there. There you go. Like that? Okay. Back up. All right, Brad, give it some gas. We clear? Okay, okay. It's not great, but it'll help keep the cold out. We can turn the car on now and then, but we can't keep it running all night. How come you left mom? Caleb. Mm, mm... What'd she say? That you left because we were more mature than you. Yeah, well... I mean... She's not wrong. You know, back then, i-- i didn't want to have kids. I mean, I hadn't really thought about it, you know? I wasn't more than a couple years older than you guys. And then, you know, mom got pregnant, and she didn't want to, you know-- she wanted to keep it. But now, it's so different. I mean, I know to you guys, it's just, you know, being away from your friends and video games and shit. But to me... It's-- it's the best thing in my life. I mean, you guys are the best thing in my life. It's pretty much the only thing i haven't screwed up yet. That's why, you know, this little adventure that we're out on... Your mom and Ted, they can't find out about this. You know? I don't think they'd let us hang out anymore. You know, i-i just-- you know, I just can't let that happen. What? What's going on? Mom, um-- mom was gonna tell you when we got back. Caleb, you're not supposed to say anything. What do you mean, said not to tell? Tell what? Ted got a promotion, and we're moving. Where? London. London? I mean, what? That's-- that's crazy. What... London. Y-you're... You're-- you're moving to London? We don't want to go. Of course not. Yeah, all our friends are here and stuff. No. You're not-- you're not moving to London. I-I'll talk to your mom. You're-- you're not moving anywhere. We leave at the end of the month. Wh-- what, you're just... They can't do that. That's... What, they're just gonna-- just gonna drag you away halfway across the world? What-- and I never get to see you again? That's insane! I mean, you're my kids! You're my kids! Ted said he would help you buy a ticket, though, if you want to come visit. Oh, fucking Ted's gonna help me. It's okay, dad. No! Dad! No! No, no! Dad! Aah! No! Dad, no... Aah! Aah! It's-- it's okay. It's okay. Fuck! No, no! Dad, stop. What are you doing, dad? Aah! No! Dad! Aah! Dad! Dad, what are you doing? Dad, stop it! Please! Aah! Dad, don't... Da-- dad? Dad, what are you... Dad? Hey... Hey... I'm fine. I'm fine. We're the only ones out here. More than 30 miles. Just listen. All the sound just gets swallowed up. It's incredible. I feel like we're on the moon. Dad, you okay? No. Everything's gonna be all right. Look what I found. Put it on. Here's a blanket. Thank you. Okay, let's try to get some sleep. We got an early morning tomorrow. Stop snoring. You stop moving. What are you doing? Brad. Will you quit it? What? What? Where did he go, Brad? I'm so cold. Oh, shit, come on, please. Come on. What's wrong? It's not turning on. He just went to get help, right? I don't know. Maybe. Oh, funny. Who'd you think it was? Bradley thought you were big foot. Where have you been? I went for a hike to scout things out. Did you find help? No, but a couple years ago, we were set up on the other side of this valley. And we went hunting one weekend, and there's a cabin down there. I think that's our best bet. So grab all the stuff. How is that our best bet? We've gotta go back to the highway and try and find help from there. No, no. Hey, grab the stuff out there. Now, we're too far from the road. We can't be out in the cold for that long, and this truck isn't gonna keep us warm. What about food? I'm starving. Yeah, we'll find something there. Just grab what you can carry. Essentials only. We gotta keep it light. Gonna be slow going in the snow. Yeah, but how are we gonna find this place? Where's your sense of adventure? Let's go. This is bullshit. What? This way. How do you know? See these branches? They're bigger on this side. They get more sun. Less stress from the north wind. It means they point south. Come on. How much further is it? Dad? Hey, should we really keep going if we're not sure where we're headed? You got a better idea? This is the right way. I know I'm right. Come on. Come on. Keep an eye out for the cabin. We should be getting close. I know it's here somewhere. Come on. Hey, wait, wait-- wait a minute. What? Shut up. What? Can you not hear that? Well, what was it? I just-- shouldn't we go and check it out? It's gone. Come on. We should go and find them, no? Come on. I know. Try not to think about it. Look! Finally! Yes! Told ya! Brad! Dad! Bradley! Dad, get me out! Caleb, stay back! Get off the ice, now! Hello! Hello! Dad... Come on. I got you guys some blankets. You gotta-- you gotta make a fire! Get them off! Here, here... I can't... See if you can find some matches. Come on, Caleb, hurry up! I'm so cold. Look over there. Hurry up! Matches, matches... Get your hands up. Oh, here! Here they go. It's working. It's working, it's working! I got... Why would anybody want to live all the way out here? Um... Well, people mostly use it for hunting or ice fishing or something, and you can leave it in the same shape you found it. We'll have to chop up some more wood before we leave. When will that be? I don't know. I fucked up. I fucked up. It's okay. We're having fun. I thought I was gonna lose you. I thought I was gonna lose you. Dad, it's okay. Dad... Dad? Uh... J-just come back to the fire. You don't have... It's okay. I just-- i just need to sleep. I can't lose you guys. I just can't. Was this your card? No. Yeah, it was. Okay, one second. How about this one? Was it that one? What? What is that? I don't know. Brad? Wh-what is it? Dad! Dad. Dad! Dad! What? Dad! Hey! Jesus Christ! Whoa! Who the fuck-- who the fuck are you? Look, does he know what he's doing? Yeah, you're fine. Dad... Whoa! What the fuck you doing here? Hey, hey... Hey, you talk English. What the hell you doing here? Look, we've been out here hunting for three days, all right? We tried to leave earlier, but we couldn't get the truck out. Hey, Brad, get their guns. Brad, get their guns now! Put them in the back room. It's okay. It's okay. Just... So where's your truck? On the access road, just around the cabin, down that trail. I don't-- look, I'm Richard. Okay? This is Luke. Stop talking French, okay? Hey! Parlez anglais, s'il vous plat. He's-- he just said we were here first, okay? We can share. It'll be all right. Listen to your son, okay? It's not even your fucking cabin, man. We can't just leave them out there. It's freezing. What are you boys doing up here, anyway? He was teaching us to shoot. Yeah? Are you okay? He fell through the ice. It was crazy. No shit. Have some of this. Soothe your throat. Are you out of your fucking mind? They're kids. Hey, man, relax. I'm just tryin' to help. You go over there in the corner and relax. You boys go in the back room and get some sleep. We're not tired. Now. Man, we just-- you want some of this? You all right? When are we leaving? I don't know. I'm starving. Here. Here. Just to be safe. What do you think they want? What do you mean? Come here. Tell me what they're saying. Uh, they're talking really fast. Something about their truck. Maybe just getting their truck. Where'd you learn how to speak French? School. I hate French class. All right. Go lie down. Hey! Where's-- where's my dad? I don't know. I got up, and he was gone. Well, where you going? I'm just gonna go see if i can get this truck outta here. Can I come with you? Ah, nah. Look, I think you should stay here. How's your brother? He's still-- he's still asleep. Good. Well, just keep that fire going, and I'm sure your dad will be back soon, okay? Breaker 1-9, come in. Breaker 1-9, anybody home? Breaker 1-9, anybody there? Hello? Anyone there? Do you read me? Do you copy? Do you copy? Repeat back. Do you copy? Fuck. Holy shit! You scared the hell outta me. What are you doing? Just tryin' to get this thing outta here. You want to give me a hand? Do you mind giving it some gas? All right, go for it. Whoa, whoa! Easy! What are you doing? You all right, man? Look, why don't you try pushing, huh? All right. Hey, man. Look, we're gonna get your kids outta here. Okay? I promise. All right? Everything's gonna be okay. Just... Just give it a push. Hello? Hello? Hello. Can... Listen, can you hear me? We're stranded out here. We got some kids here that need help. We're on a logging road-- what's your location? About 50 miles... What the fuck? You're gonna-- you're gonna-- you're gonna take them away. What? Look, it... Can, um... Luke! Wait! Wait! Wait! Hey! I don't wanna hurt you! Luke! Shh! What the fuck! What the fuck! Stop. Stop. Luke! Luke! Ugh! What the fuck is wrong with you? Please stop. Please stop. Get off! What the fuck? Get off me! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! Aah! Stop! Stop! Stop it! I don't wanna hurt you! Help! Stop! Hey. Hey. Hey, wake up! Wake up! Wake up! Look at that! Okay, put it in the pile. What? He should be back. Maybe I, uh-- i go check on him, okay? Well, should I come too? No, no, no. Here. You wait here, all right? Okay. Hey, man. Hi. Where's everybody at? It's just us. Dad's been gone all day. Where'd he go? I don't know. He's okay, right? Richard? Richard! Richard! No. Caleb, wait! Wait! Wait! Dad! Dad, where are you? Da-- dad? Hey. Come here. What happened? Caleb, come here. Come here. Come on. Come here. Hey. This thing could feed us for weeks. Here. Just hold that. Hold that. Ugh! Ugh! Richard, where is he? I don't know what you're saying. He's not at the truck. He should be back. Hey, what's going on? Hey, go back inside of the house. Is he at the cabin? Uh-uh. You do something to him? My English, you don't understand. Go inside, everything's fine. Just go back to the house. No, you're coming with me. Everybody come with me. They're not gonna come with you. You're outta your fucking mind! What-- dad, you-- stop, dad! Luke, run! Dad, don't shoot! Get off. Get off! Dad, stop! Get back to the house. Now! Caleb, come on! Come on, Caleb! Come! Do you think he's okay? Where's the other guy? What was he talking about? I was trying to scare them off. - Okay? - Okay. I'm trying to keep you safe, okay? Okay. Just stay here. They're still out there somewhere. Give me that bag. We can't just leave him here. Look, he doesn't want to leave, Caleb. Shit. Why are there two sets? I don't know. Come on, we just gotta go. This doesn't look like the way we came. We shouldn't be here. You're the one that made us leave. I mean we shouldn't have come out here in the first place. You wanted to shoot the gun, too. Yeah, I know, but... If we had left when I said, none of this would have happened. You were just too busy trying to be dad's best friend. Oh, come-- I'm sorry, Caleb. Please, look. We gotta stick together if we wanna get outta here, okay? You don't know where you're going. Think somebody's just gonna come save us? No, but you don't wanna get any more lost. We can't get any more lost. You just left me. We were gonna try to find help. We gotta stick together. You can't just leave me. Yeah, well, we were gonna come back for you, dad. I promise. Say something. Do you have any idea what could happen to you out here? Look, we're sorry. Look, I'm your father! It's my job to protect you. You think that's funny? You got something you want to say to me? You got something you want to say to me? Say it. You think I'm a shitty father? Hm? Say it. Hm? You think I'm a shitty dad? Say it. Yeah? Say it. You're a shitty dad. There you go. You gonna say it like a little pussy, or are you gonna say it like a man? Huh? Say it again. Say it. Say it! Say it! There you go. There you go. There you go. Fuck you. Come on! Fucking...! Say it. No! Say it! No! You think I'm a shitty father? No! You think I'm a shitty father? Say it! Say it! Get off me! Say it! Huh? Say it. I'm a shitty father. Say it. Get off me, please! Say it! Dad! Say it! You're a shitty father! There you go! Let him go, please! Get off me! Shh, shh, shh... Shh... Fuck off. Dad? Dad! Dad! Stay back. Hey, we could smash out the windows. It's too loud. He'd hear it. We could... We could build a bonfire. Maybe a helicopter will come find us. What... where's he going? Give me that thing. There you go. Try to get the other one. Come on. Shh, shh. Can you fit? I don't know. Go on. Do you need a hand? I don't think so. Hey, can you see anything? Is there a way out? I don't know. Here. Anything? Oh, my god! Brad! Bradley! What? Caleb? He's not... Shh, shh. Okay. What do you... what? Okay, just... He's not... he's not moving. I don't know what happened. That other guy, he's... Brad, he's dead. Listen, you can't wait. I'll figure something out and come find you. You gotta go. What's going on in there? Nothing. We're fine. You feeling okay? Better, thanks. We're okay. I'm chopping a bunch of wood so it's gonna be warm in here in a couple minutes. Say something, say something! Great, thank you. Okay, okay. The keys. Here, take these. Find their truck and go get help, okay? I-- shh-shh, come on, come on. Hey, look, I know you don't wanna go on your own, but you have to, okay? You don't have a choice. Okay? You gotta go. You gotta get help, okay? It can't be far. Go! Okay. Now! Okay, okay. Caleb? He's sleeping. Is he mad at me? No. He's just tired. He's fine. I'm trying to keep you safe. Yeah. Yeah, we're... yeah. Of course. As long as we stay here together, we'll be okay. Sure. You gotta trust me. Alone? Where's your father? He has Bradley back at the cabin. You need to get us out of here. I dug the truck out. Richard has the keys. Where did you find them? My dad had them. Get in. I'm not leaving my brother. Okay. Oh, shit. Bradley! Caleb? Bradley! Caleb? Bradley! Brad! Caleb? Caleb? Come here. No! Dad, please! Dad! Stop! Hey! They're gonna find us, you know? We can't leave. We can't go back. They're gonna take you away. I know what I'm doing. They'll find us. It's gonna be okay. Dad! Caleb? Hi. Don't look at me like that. If... if we stay here, can you teach us to go fishing? And to hunt? - We can make it work. - Caleb, what are you doing? Yeah, it'll be fun. Right? We can rebuild the house, and... Just us. Yeah. It'll be okay. Yeah. Of... of course. We can go hunting, we can go fishing, we can do whatever you want. Go! Go! Get out of here! Come on! Quickly! Faster, let's go! No! Go! Dad-- come on, come on, come on! Caleb, come on! Where are the keys, Caleb? Come on, come on! Come on. Come on, please! Hurry, hurry! Go, go, go, go, go! Hey, where are you going? What the fuck are you doing? Lock the door! Go, go, go! We've gotta stay together! Get off him! I'm your father! Please don't leave me! Get off, dad! Please! Get off me! Dad! Please! Stop it! Stop! How can you leave me? You're hurting him! You're hurting him! It's only us now! Get off! Don't leave! We'll be okay.
