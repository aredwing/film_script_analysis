They won't tell them about races, they'll find different things to tell them. They'll burn your car down for starters. Come on, man! It was an accident, it could have been me in that car. If it was you, we wouldn't let them get away with it! Only for a month, man. Go to your sister, and then we'll see. What are you talking about! I am not going back to Russia, never! The fuckin' Albanians can suck your balls, man! - Tell them man! - Yeah man! I'm staying! End of story! NOBOD Y One year later Quit hanging around, Julia... keep working! HOMER - OD YSSEY Let's see... Where did we stop? Hey scholar! What took you so long. People are waiting! Papagiannis, Karaoli Dimitriou and Afroditis str... Sorry... Did I scare you? Yeah... I got a little scared, I'm ok. - Are you alright? - Yeah. - The pizzas? - Ok. I have to go now. What about Tassos? Thanks, but no way! He is a bit... he is such a jerk, Nelly! The other day, we were at school talking, and he was looking behind me. I turned around and find out he was looking at his reflection on a glass! Ok, listen now, I'll see you tonight ok? Bye, kisses. Come to prepare the table... Your father and brother are waiting to eat. (In Albanian) I'll go check if the laundry is ready... We haven't ordered pizzas, lad. - Today is the date? - Yeah, today... Enough... I haven't been fucked in the joint, and I won't get fucked now. - How are you? - Fine, man. How about you? Fine. Reading to your father again, huh? Did he get it all? - Have you bought a car? - No No? - Girlfriend? - What do you mean? Speak up! Do you have a girlfriend or not? I do... I mean I did... I mean... What kind of bullshit question is this? Same old... Like I've never left. You too. As I see, they've brought you to reason. - Mom, where is my blouse? - What blouse? - You already know! - I don't know. The one I was trying on before, tell me! You should keep them from loosing them. (In Albanian) What blouse is she talking about? I'm sharing my cell with this guy. I'm kind of chilling, so does he. Then he starts scratching himself, I mean scratching himself to death. He scratches his nose... and scratches... his nose falls off, he picks it up and throws it out. Why are you laughing, asshole? Listen to the rest of it. We stay cool for a while, and he starts scratching himself again. Scratching his ear. Scratching and scratching, bye-bye ear, he throws it out of the cell too. And the wanker didn't have enough. He starts scratching his arm. Scratching and scratching, there goes the arm... he throws it away as well. I look at him and I'm like, "Hey dude, I can see you're leaving us one day at a time." It's a joke and I've heard it before. You've asked about how it was in the joint, huh? It's a fact. That's the way it was. You meet a girl and then you can't get your mind off her, has this ever happened to you? To meet her out of the blue, and then think about her all the time. Sure, man, happens every day, especially in the last year! Come on, prick, I'm serious. Me too! You know me. I see a girl, I get crazy, and after a while it ends. I fuck her and run. You are talking about being horny. This is true love, pal! I'm going! Even if you litter all my clothes, I'm going. Do you want me to wake him up? I don't care! Don't you get it? You're a grown woman. You can't hang around in balls almost naked. I am seventeen years old. Seventeen! This is my school's ball. At your age I used to work all day. It was exhausting. No time for balls and loitering. Nobody made you come here. Nobody! It was your choice. We've done it for your own good. We wanted you to grow up in a proper way. So, not doing what my friends do is the proper way? - You are a Muslim girl! - You are the Muslim! I am nothing! Together again at last! We'll fuck them all! This motherfucker was in jail, where have you been, you asshole? - On the wildside. - Where, in the pizza place? What's your problem with the pizzas, man? He wants to be the pizzaboy of the month! - Pizzaboy my ass. - Fuck you all! - They make some fine pizzas, man. - How do you know? I've tried it, wanker. I don't believe it, he had to order pizza so that he could meet you. He didn't bring the pizza, man, a Pakistani did. They make some fine spaghetti too. Hey guys... the ladies... She has sucked his bone marrow to the last drop, man. Did you see her? A wild beast. Came straight from the jungle. Listen to this! There comes this dude, totally rolling in it... He owns an Astra, two hundred and forty horses, and there he comes and says, it won't do. What are you saying, man? Two hundred and forty horses won't do? - The guy was stuck, it won't do. - What did your boss tell him? Tell him what? You are an asshole? And starts loading it. Turbo engine, intercooler... the car is over-fucking-loaded... three hundred horses! You can add two wings and it takes-off, man! If we pass later by the parking lot, I'll tell him to set it up. Why are you hitting me, asshole? - He got out just today! - So what? He's spent time for dope, not for illegal car racing! Asshole... you always slapping just like that... Can you lend me for some action? I'm gonna tell her: Jungle-girl, are you aware of who I am? I am Jacques Cousteau, get prepared for some exploration! Jacques Cousteau explored the oceans, not the jungle, asshole. Who did the jungle? How should I know? - What about home? - What about it? Have you got anywhere to stay? You can come to my place. Me, you and the rest of the country. I'll sleep next to granny? Yeah, you're gonna kiss her goodnight too. Seriously, what do you say? - He's staying at your place? - Yes Let's go to the bathroom. Can I come too? Did you get pissed off with something? You've got this look... I'm ok. I had a quarrel with my mother at home. And you got dressed like a nun to punish her? Where is that blouse we bought together? Wait... Put this on. Do as I tell you just once and put it on. And then we'll do the rest. Come on hurry, the guy is waiting. Are you doing this on purpose? Yeah. On purpose. I'm sitting there with my friends. See you later. Have you pissed on your pants, man? - Where are the drinks? - I'll go get new ones. The other one has been released, how come you buy the drinks? - I received my bachelor degree. - What? I received my bachelor degree. We'll talk about it later. I'm going to the barwoman! - So, a lawyer that is. - So? Nothing. Nice... Life is full of surprises. So you won't be talking to us from now on? Definitely I'll be talking to you. I'll make you my best client. I'll see you later. Would you like to dance? Why don't you dance? I'm dancing. I'm dancing I tell you... In my thoughts. I'm ok. (In Russian) What do you think you're doing, man? She is the rat's sister. Wait. Wait. I'm sorry for the incident, my friends are a pain in the ass sometimes. Wait! Since yesterday, when we... bumped into each other... What? I think about you all the time. Those friends of yours... are they Russians? - How about you? - Yeah... No... I am Nobody. That's what you'll say to your friends if they ever ask you. I was with Nobody! I was with Nobody! Let's go inside? - I have to go. - We'll be the two of us only. Really, I've got to go home. - Can I... can I take you home? - Have you got a car? No. I've got a scooter. ...but I don't have it here I kind of like that you don't have a car. My brother cares only for his car. That is why I'm saying this. I know. Do you know Tybalt? Give him my regards. Regards from Nobody? Afterwards... are you going back... to the night club? Maybe. I don't know. - Why? - Nothing... Yesterday, when I saw you at the stairs... went out the balcony to see you... But you didn't see me. If you'd looked up, you would have seen me. - My telephone number... - I have it. I have to go now. - What is your name? - Julia. Julia... I haven't felt like this before. You are the most beautiful girl I have ever met. The most beautiful girl in the world! No, no! If they wake up... If they hear you... One kiss and I'll leave. Just one kiss. Go now. One more (In Albanian) First you run away and then you bring your steady here! So everyone in the neighborhood should learn that you are a slut. I sweat all day at the construction sites, and both of you became outcasts! Why? Why? What's up, man? Was it the rat's sister the one you're head over hills with? I didn't know she was his sister. And when you found out? Something changed? What's up, asshole, are you totally mad? you think you'd become a lawyer and fuck the rest of us? How do you know he is the one who gave you to the cops? Before jail, you pushed drugs to everyone. Anyone might have been. Correct, wanker! - It could have been you maybe? - Cut the crap! What are you staring, wanker? Are you the rat? Tell me, you prick, did you tell the cops? Fuck you, I'm sick of this bullshit, car races and Albanians and shit! You may be pretending to be a local but... deep down inside you are still the same guy. Take it easy with the girlie. It's gonna get worse with them. Worse than what? Motherfucker... Like the guy in the cell. - What guy? - You're leaving us one day at a time. And you're leaving us fucking quickly. I'm gonna sit and watch. You've got nowhere to go! He didn't fuck, man... it's hard... Get lost or I'll fuck you first thing in the morning! Who told you this shit, that the nose gets soft when you... It's scientifically confirmed, squeeze mine. It's because of the black chick, yesterday. Now, tell me about the sister of that Albanian rat. Is her pussy tight or not? He doesn't answer to this kind of questions, he is a gentleman. Guys, cut the bullshit with Albanian and stuff, cause you pit against me. After all, we don't know that this nice guy told tales on me, do we? What do you want now, huh? (In Russian) Let's hit the road now! Coming or you have to check whether you're having your nails done... or a golf game? Come on, pal... I told you! I was with the kids from school. Really? I hear other things. They told me they saw you leaving the club with a Russian. Is he the one who climbed up onto the balcony? Did he screw you? I asked you something. Tell me, did he screw you? - Answer me! Did he screw you? - No. Are you telling the truth? I'm sorry, I'm sorry, ok? You 're young and you don't get it. They have quarrel with me and they... Look, he doesn't like you. He'll screw you, he'll record you on his cell phone, and he'll humiliate you to our folks. So, you are protecting me? Like mum and dad do. No to be humiliated. I don't give a shit for whatever our folks tell you. I don't want you to get into trouble. You're never gonna see him again. Ever! Or else? What's gonna happen? You'll protect me some more? He shoots you with his cell phone, so what? Do you know in how many videos I'm on? - I could open a video rental! - Stop it, Nelly! This is not like him. He's not that kind of a guy. These guys are the worst kind! Pricks, they play it nice and stuff, I can recognize them at once. He doesn't pretend to be nice. He doesn't pretend to be anything! Its like... whatever he does and says, the way he smiles, the way he looks at me, like nothing else counts for him... Only I count for him. - I hadn't realized that you... - What? Go talk to him, not over the phone, in person, so that you can see his eyes. - If he gets pissed off? - He won't. If things are like you say they are and he sees you so in love, he wont get pissed off. - He was different before... - Before prison? Before the car crash. He couldn't cope with it. After that he began doing some crazy shit. Before, even if he was to push one joint he would be careful. - After that... - I remember. You know what I think? I think he did it on purpose. He wanted to get caught. And when he got caught he liked it. He wanted to be punished... be punished for the other guy who got burned... And what's the deal with the Albanian guy? Prison was not enough for him. He won't rest until he gets killed... Did you see our pal... I just got out and he's already found me a job. He's a real friend. No, I'm not at work. Alright, in half an hour. Yeah. - I've got to go. - Sure you do. Are you going to the Albanian chick? At least, if you fuck her this time, shoot her with your cell phone to send it to... Come off it, alright? What are you doing, asshole? Are you nuts? - Don't be angry. - I'm not angry. If your brother told you so, that means he knows. That's what I want. To humiliate you. I didn't believe him. But I wanted to hear it from you also. What is this? - Did he do this to you? - No. He didn't... It's because we were late last night... ...they heard... Did he hear me climbing onto the balcony? Can we please not talk about it any more... Please... It doesn't matter. I've been beaten up before. At least... yesterday it had a meaning. It's ok, honestly. What's up... are the prisons overcrowded so they're cutting loose the murderers? They're making room for the rats. I heard that ten of our guys fucked you while you were in there. There's even more... they fucked me with their asses and I was caressing their back... Cut it off, man! Cut it off! The boss. He doesn't like this kind of shit. One of these days we'll have a talk. I don't think so. First you have to learn how to drive. Try not to kill someone again. We got one of yours and asked, "how come the Albanians make the best blowjobs"... He told us that... your mothers taught you, so you could suck Hotza, who fancies boys. Do they still go to the bridge at night? For sure. Will you tell him to arrange it? - It's not necessary. - What are you talking, man? He provoked him. Straight forward. He has to go. I have to go. It's about my reputation. - What is this place? - You'll see. No, don't... My mother used to work here when we first came to Greece... Somewhere over there. My father was working too, I was a little child, so she used to take me with her... I used to run away and come here, cause it was closed since then. My mother was looking for me. I used to come up here because I liked the sea, It used to calm me. It still does... Every time I dreamed about fairy tales... with princes and stuff, it all took place up here... I used to have it in my mind, I don't know why... That's why we came here? You find it stupid? Your turn now, tell me something about yourself. - What? - Tell me something about yourself! Ever had the feeling... to be the wrong person in the wrong place, the wrong time? Seriously now. Have you ever had such a feeling? With me it's always been like that. Whatever happened, whatever I did, I always felt like that. Until yesterday. Like everything went upside down. And everything is suddenly right. Do you remember if the lock was on the left or on the right side? It must have been on the right side. I don't want my brother to find out I was here. He gave me the key. He parks his car here cause he is afraid that someone will steal it. This is his secret place. Leave it like this. Where now? It's not something special. - It's quiet... - Yes quiet it is. Are all these books yours? These and these were my father's. These are mine. Have a seat - Your folks are in Russia? - My mother is. My father got killed. - I'm sorry I... - Oh, it's ok. As a philologist it didn't matter that he was careless. But working in construction sites... I am asking because my father always tells us... that we're going back to Albania. He can do whatever he likes... I am not going anywhere. Wait a second, please wait... Wait a second, - I need to tell you something. - What? I need to tell you something. What, tell me. What? Don't look at me... Turn and look the other way. Look, this... This thing... This thing that we're doing now... Look the other way, please... This thing that is going to happen... I haven't done it before. That's it. If you don't want to... No, I want to. Really. Go on. "HOMER - OD YSSEY" "Cyclops, since you've asked, here is my name in return to your friendly gift. My name is Nobody. My mother, my father, and all my friends call me Nobody". Is this where "Nobody" comes from? It suits you. How long have you been awake? Why didn't you wake me up? I like to watch you sleeping. Are you ok? I'm fine. I feel a little strange... but I'm fine... It wasn't like I thought it would be. Better or worse? It was different. I think, I have to try one more time to find out... He doesn't answer? Fuck him, man. He's stuck with her. He's right. Leave him alone! He can stop you. I cannot. You sound like a chick, man. Be cool. Nothing's gonna happen. Don't get mad. We'll just set them, race and that's it. And your tits have grown with the shit your coach feeds you, you look like my mother. I have fucked your mother, asshole. Her tits are no good. What are you talking about, man? Did you mean that, huh? There is no reason to do this. There is no reason not to do this. I didn't like that your mate got killed. No way. But he tried to come from the left side and I stopped him. But it was stupid that you gave me to the cops. Yes, it was. But I couldn't leave it be. Shall we finish it today? Whatever happens. Whatever happens. Better, much better than I expected. I want to tell you something strange. But don't laugh. Before, It was like I was seeing lights... Don't laugh. Lots of lights flashing. I saw lights flashing... I don't know why... that's it. Aren't you going to answer? Go on... answer it, or they won't leave us alone. Hello... Where is he? In the intensive care... no one is permitted to get in. (In Russian) Why did you bring her with you? It was her brother that threw him off the road! What's their problem? Get the hell out of here! Shut up, she has nothing to do with this! (In Russian) Fuck the bitch What are you looking at, you fucking bitch! Get lost you, Albanian whore! Piss off! Fuck off, asshole! Do you know how my first time was? Neither do I. I was in a club, I got drunk, and when I woke up, next to me was Giorgos Argyriou. - Argyriou who from 12a? - It was 10a then. It happened during our school trip. And you couldn't remember anything? Anything at all. But I remembered when I saw the video he shot. - There are worst things than this. - It's not enough to think like that. Don't be silly girl! Look, for one time in my life... I want things to happen exactly as I want them to happen. I think I have the right to want that. For Christ's sake, my Julia! I have to fight with everybody... and it's very hard for me and I don't know why it's so hard. Mom, I told you I was with Nelly. You are going to regret what you did! Mom, I told you... Don't you lie to me, girl, I can see it all over you! In your face, your hands, everywhere! I would know even if I was a stranger! Nobody will ever want you for his wife. Ever! You are going to regret this, It'll be painful! Because you have regretted that you and dad got... Don't you ever say that again! Your brother is back... Is it my fault now? Did I bring her In here? Shut up, man! Some friends... you're always taking his part. You and the other one also! He comes and goes whenever he feels like it! Some friend he is! Is there any relative of the young man with the car accident? He asked for someone close. How is he? The doctor will inform you. Follow me. Look at you, man. Handsome... you look gorgeous. That's what you lose when you don't come with us. So, what about the chick, did you fuck her? Of course you fucked her... That's balance. He fucked me... and you fucked his sister. It counts, right? Tell me something, nerd... how should I declare myself to the place I'm going... a Russian or a Greek? Fuck them, man... you'll be Nobody... ...Nobody. Where is his house? Tell me, man... where is his house? Speak up, man! Speak up, asshole! What kind of a person you are, he put away Merkout! Fuck you with your bullshit, both of you! What are you going to do, go to his house and shoot him in front of his folks? What more do you need to stop all this? Fuck his house, fuck his family, fuck them all! I want his car! Even if you don't tell me, I will find his fucking car! (In Russian) We're in business Hey, how about me? Great! (In Russian) Get down! Go get me the lint and the gasoline from the trunk. If you go again to the cops, it will get worse. And say hello to your whore sister... she knows exactly what I mean... He's got a knife! Hello... He's not here... I'm his wife... Yes, Tybalt... I'm his mother... Who is it? You've got him, you motherfucker... you butchered the faggot... You fucked him! He pulled a knife, he pulled a knife for the fucking car... Stop! We'll get killed, man! Get out... (In Russian) It's him Pedra will get you in the ship. (In Russian) Want some? Tell him... no guns, no drugs... just him. Okay? Only him... - He must bring his passport. - It's okay, he understood. So, if he's late he wont get in, are we clear? That's the best thing to do. Go away. Don't do like Mercut did. At least one of you should survive. Come on... we have to fix a few more things. Everything's gonna be alright. I don't know. What do you mean you don't know, man? If you turn your self in, you think the Albanians will let you get away with it? (In Albanian) Yes... Do we know where he lives? It's a deal. I'll go home, come there to settle it. He goes with the car? What's up? - How's it going? - Fine. (In Russian) For the road. And don't go to your place. Someone could be waiting for you there. Take care. Okay, let's move on, kids. Hey, man, shouldn't we hide also? What did I say, man? Watch your head. Previously I had fish here, but it didn't go well... You said you are Russian, aren't you? There, sit... (In Albanian) Tell your mother to get ready... We leave in the morning... we're taking Tybalt to Albania. and you get your things... you'll stay there... at grandma's. Go tell her! I'm the only one, no one else has authentic passports. All the others have fakes. They are good only for Africa. Where are you heading to? The same shit is wherever you go. I became 50 and the only place I've gone is my previous wife's village. I have no urge to go anywhere. Where would I find a worse place? I'll tell you this, so many passports pass from my hands, and still I don't own one. Yes, I swear to God! Each time I say it, it makes me shiver. I don't have a passport of my own... Aren't you going to pick up your phone? Why don't you answer? I called you so many times... My parents want to take me back to Albania... Someone killed my brother... I don't know what to do... Is your daddy here? (In Albanian) Go to your room immediately! - Who is this man? - Nobody. Go to your room. What are you staring at? Go! There... Roman Montegu. Don't make any foolishness and forget to learn your data. My parents want to take me back to Albania... Someone killed my brother... I don't know what to do... I don't know how it happened... Listen to me... It was an accident... he had a knife... I was in self defence... I didn't mean to hurt him. It was an accident... Go away! Stop staring at me, go! Listen to me Let me go, don't touch me! I am begging you... listen... - It was an accident. - I don't believe you. Let go off me! Don't touch me! Please. Please. I've got nowhere to go... I only want to be with you. I don't know what to tell you. Tell me anything... You know what to do. You always did! (In Albanian) You can bang your hand as much as you want... We should let the police handle it. He killed your son! he police would do nothing, the guy would remain unpunished. Tomorrow we'll go back and mourn him like we should. We will mourn him with the blood of someone else! Stop it, the kid is here. Where were you? Out. You haven't packed yet. Go on! What are you looking at? Go! - Let's go. - Are you sure? BE BACK SOON I didn't hear you leaving. I thought you changed your mind. - Thanks a lot. - Thank God. Don't forget to learn the data. Let go off me! (In Albanian) Dad, pull over when you can please. - What's wrong with her? - It's the car. "We, the people of Achaia, on our way back from Troy through oceans and various winds, longing to return home, but took the wrong way..." If you like it that much, why don't you read it by yourself? Homer wrote these stories to be told, not to be read. "we beg of you to rescue us. And if you do so, we shall fill you with gifts, as is customary in every place around the world. Hospitable Zeus protects travellers, and lets his grace follow them throughout the journey" Do you know what I like about this story? What? That someday he reached his homeland.
