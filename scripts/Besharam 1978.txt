I swear on God I know nothing. I've never even seen Mr. Dharamdas. I.. I got instructions on his behaIf. Who gave you instructions? I don't know that either. I got orders on the phone. I don't know anything except that. Where did you get the goods to? Behind the paIace, in the Manori jungIe. But I don't know who took the goods from there and where. Look, rest for some time. Think over carefuIIy and then teII us. You don't need to be scared here. No one wiII harm you. Did you mark something, Subramaniam? The paIace is mentioned.. ..in every case reIated.. .. to Dharamdas. - Yes, sir. Dharamdas and Prince are one person.. ..but we don't have any evidence. This man is very important for us. Perhaps he'II prove usefuI for us to reach Dharamdas. Sir, that man has died. - What? C'mon, Iet's see. What the heII.. How shaII we unveiI Dharamdas now? Who permitted you to beg, eh? From here tiII CoIaba is my area, ok? Whom do you give the commission? Whom? You think you can beg anywhere? How Iong have you been working here? - 7 days. You're young. PeopIe must be giving you much money. - Yes. How much have you earned tiII now? TeII me. 120 rupees.. 50 paisa.. If you want to work in this area, you wiII have to give me 500/0. You got it. I won't give you. - Take out the money. Let go of my hand. BIoody fooI, idiot.. Give me the money.. c'mon.. Aren't you ashamed to beat a girI? You are right, sir. Let me hit a man. Oh! Run away; run. Thank you for everything, sir. - You speak EngIish, too? What can be done? EngIish is very usefuI in my business. It impresses the customer. I get 50 paisa instead of 10. Where are you going, sir? I wiII drop you. You'II drop me? - Yes, my car wouId be coming soon. Your car? - Not mine, sir; I have a friend who is a driver. He is a very good man. He drops me every day. There he is. You're so taII; you can't waIk Iike that. Driver, I have a friend with me today; pIease, give him a Iift. He's a very good person. Driver, I hope that won't bother you. Why wouId it bother me? PIease, get in the car. C'mon. - It's quite a big car. Shucks. My diary. This.. what is this drama you're pIaying? The account of your begging work is written in EngIish here. Caught me! WeII, I am a student. Beggars' probIem in India.. ..that is the probIem of beggars in India.. ..I am writing a thesis on this topic for PHD. No one has written anything on this topic tiII now. That's why I had to pIay this drama. Look, if I didn't pIay this part, how wouId I know.. ..that the beggars have to seek permission, get a permit.. ..give commission to others? And you know how many new words I've Iearnt? RascaI! WorthIess! I wiII finish you! Bogus man! Dare shout at me? You.. Enough! Enough! That's enough for this day. Driver, pIease stop the car here. Yes.. ok, I'II be off now. Listen! Meet me at that same pIace tomorrow, ok? - Yes. Goodbye, driver. - Goodbye, sir. - Tata. Madam, why do you Iie so much. - Shut up! Move. How are you? How are you, sister? - I'm fine. HeIp! Someone, get me out. HeIp! HeIp! Someone, stop the car. I'II die. HeIp! HeIp him! - Stop the car. I'II die. Stop the car! Stop the car. HeIp! It's too hot in here. Someone stop the car. Where is this vehicIe moving to? HeIp! It is very hot in here. HeIp! Which donkey was driving the car? He broke my waist. Who is it? Why are you aII staring at me?.. .. Catch that man and break his head. Which idiot was driving the car? I wiII canceI his Iicense. Who was he? Who was driving the car? - I.. I was driving the car. You? Doesn't matter. Accidents happen every day. Accidents happen every day. It's not your fauIt. Had your Ieg sIipped off the break? - What? What are you standing here for? C'mon, move from here. Yes, I am fine. Go. Don't waste my time. Yes, go, go,go. Yes, go, go. These peopIe are idIers. I hope your car is not damaged. - To heII with the car! I'II repair it; I am a mechanic. If something of yours is damaged, I'II repair that, too. Yes? - I mean if something is broken in your car. No, no, my car is fine. If you want to go somewhere, I can drop you. Don't drop me anywhere. I stay here. - Ok, bye. - Bye. Lady! Lady! I recaII something. I must get this car out of here. I'II need 4 - 5 mechanics for that. Can you drop me at my garage? Come. - Thank you. How far are you going? - TiII there. I want to go far, but today it's ok tiII here. - Ok, bye. Today.. you didn't teII me your name. - My name is Rosy. Now ask me my name. - What is your name? My name is Laxman. - Okay, Bye. We wiII bump into each other again. - What? I mean we wiII meet again. I mean if we bump into each other again, we wiII meet again. Bye. - Bye. Bye. Bye. Did you see my modeI? I'II be off now. It's five o'cIock and mother wouId be waiting. The time tabIe? Look, I'II be working here.. .. aII this night. On Seth-ji's car. If you have some work, you can come here. - Ok. I've Iost in the first two eIections. That's ok. Every one knows why I Iost. The ones who won aIso know that. Now I am ready to contest.. ..in the eIection again at your request. You know that I have no seIfish purpose for that. Come, chiId. - Greetings, father. - God bIess you. Greetings. I wiII fight on the same principIes I did before. I don't want anyone's charity or money. We just need the bIessings. You've come, chiId? Mother! You see more than normaI peopIe even without eyes. You're praising your mother again. My mother is worth aII the praise. TeII me, mother, how do you know that I've come.. ..even without seeing or hearing any sound? FeeIings are stronger than the sight, chiId. When God makes someone bIind.. ..he gives him a stronger inner sight. And the one who sees with inner sight, has many eyes. That means when I'II start earning.. ..and get your eyes operated, you'II have.. ..two outer and two inner, that is four eyes. Look, chiId, Chanda has brought tea for you. Drink it hot. - Fine. Give it. Here, hoId this. ShaII I teII you something, mother? She makes very tasty tea. That's why I don't drink tea at any cafe. Why not? And you don't eat out.. ..because you Iike the food I cook, right? Very true. I don't eat out, nor wiII I ever eat. Inspector Subramaniam, I've written to the.. ..empIoyment exchange for pIacement. Now our chance has come. The job is arranged for you. Now it is your responsibiIity to gain the evidences. - Yes, sir. You are one of my best officers. Remember this.. ..a poIice officer gets nothing in Iife except death as bonus. Don't worry, siR. I won't Iet down the poIice force of our nation. AII the best. You acted reaIIy smart the other day. Why are you sitting so siIent today? If you can't taIk of anything eIse, taIk about insurance at Ieast. Yes? I had read a very good story about an insurance agent. Yes? The story writers just write nonsense. No, this was a true story. A girI made friends with an insurance agent. Now, the girI couId not say that she Ioved him. And the insurance agent.. is just an insurance agent. He has nothing except insurance on his agenda. This is reaIIy not fair. Have I ever taIked about insurance to you? No, but you've taIked nothing tiII now, Mr. Ram. I don't Iike caIIing you Mr. Ram. I feeI as if I were going to tempIe for some Pooja. Right. Why don't you caII me Ram? Doesn't this 'mister' sound a bit formaI? Yes, it does. WeII, we forgot that story. One day when that girI was sure that.. ..the idiot boy can't taIk of anything except insurance.. ..she said, pIease insure my heart against theft. That's it. The boy opened his book and started making an account. What premium is to be paid? What are the benefits of insuring a heart? But a heart can't be insured. - Wow! Why can't it be? Isn't a heart stoIen sometimes? Look, Ms. Monica.. - What's this? You ask questions and answer them yourseIf? Do I answer them? Yes, you wiII caII me onIy Monica. I wiII caII out 'miss'. If you say both miss and Monica, what wouId I say? Nothing? This.. I mean.. I did not mean this. - What eIse did you mean? Haven't you heard this diaIogue in Hindi movies? An Indian woman Iets her hand be heId onIy once. What wiII you do if I don't Iet go of your hand? WeII, I.. I wiII take this hand to be insured. And I wiII wait for the poIicy to mature. Hey! What's this? Is this beauty spot given for insurance? No, it is a birth mark. Since the time I was born. Yes, Iife is suggesting you to fooI every one with insurance. I'II be right back. Excuse me.. excuse me.. - Rinku! What are you doing here? And what is this you're wearing? You're a princess, and this outfit.. Just Iike that; I'm with some friends. - I see, I see. Rinku, meet them. They are my daddy's friends. - HeIIo. They've come from Zurich. I'm showing them around in Bombay. Meet princess Rinku. - Princess? Manju, I must Ieave now. Bye.. bye. Is she a reaI princess? - Yes. Ram! Ram! Ram! Dear chiId, .. eating out is Iike eating poison. Eating out in restaurants ruins our heaIth and brain. Dear father, how is brain reIated to our tummies? The bonnet and the trunk have different positions. You are taIking as if you had never eaten out. Ask your mother. - Your father is right. Before marrying he ate what his mother cooked.. ..and after marriage he ate what I cooked. And that, too, cooked in pure ghee. Your father ate 10 kg ghee every day. But I don't need pure ghee; I'm not married yet. So why don't you marry? Who is stopping you? - Oh, yes. You know Mr. Ghasitaram who owns a miIk shop? He's proposed you for his daughter. ShaII I take the matter further? You beIong to the era of Arjun Pandit. You aIways think of trucks or deIivery vans. And I think of ImpaIa. Ok, bring an ImpaIa if you want. But at Ieast get married. Look, chiId, stop thinking about cars and think about girIs. You can marry the girI of your choice. But she shouId be a vegetarian. Her caste or creed does not matter to us. I don't know the caste, but I wiII sureIy bring a wife, father. He's very naughty. - He's your son after aII. Kabir once said to his subjects. The magic of name is great. If your name is Ram.. .. teII us, when wiII you go to Iive in jungIe? Tony, mind your Ianguage. Move! You spoiIed my newIy ironed shirt. I've just spoiIed the shirt; one day I might spoiI your face. RascaI! The eIections are approaching. I don't want to fight with you and go to jaiI. That wiII spoiI a vote; or I wouId have taught you a Iesson. Ram! Leave him; what are you doing? There's a Iimit to toIerance, father. There's no Iimit to toIerance, got it? Mister, Iock your son's anger in some Iocker of a bank. This anger wiII prove bad for him. - Come, chiId. If a dog bites a man, the man does not bite a dog in return. Come on. Don't stare at me, darIing.. Thirteen.. - No. - Fourteen.. - No. Father! You're hurt trying to get votes. Boss, I don't Iike his smiIe. You don't Iike the smiIe? Let's stop it. Let go of him. Let go.. Master, why do you get invoIved in eIection activity? You are a decent man. I teII you not to contest for the eIection. You said bad words to my father? Let go of me.. I'II kiII him. Let go of me.. I'II kiII him. You won't be abIe to handIe my murder. Here, drink some coId drink, ok? What was I saying, master? Your rascaI son is disturbing very much. Boss, I've never seen any man contesting the eIection cIoseIy. ReaIIy? Look at him cIoseIy. Bastard! I'II kiII you. Shut his mouth. He is disturbing. Boss, shaII I make over the master? - Oh yes, sure,sure. Wow! Wow! The make up is very good. But this dress does not go with the make up. C'mon, peopIe, cIap. I've put you in this state.. ..when you've not even started with the eIection. If you fight the eIection, think what I'II do to you. C'mon, c'mon. Laugh! Laugh! Lauch! Laugh a Iot. Curse you aII! You shouId be ashamed. You're mocking a man who is fighting.. ..the dishonest peopIe of this city? It's so shamefuI! It's very shamefuI! You bow down to the person who treats you Iike a sIave. And you put a person who is fighting for your rights in this state? Look at him! Look! Look. He is not put in this state by those goons. He is in this state.. ..because of your cowardice and shameIessness. Because of your habit to keep siIent. You do not deserve a decent man staking his Iife for you. Father! You're fighting this eIection for these dead peopIe? You toIerated this insuIt for them? They onIy know how to be scared and insuIted. These peopIe are.. You are Ram, chiId. You are not born to Iive scared of the Ravanas. No goon can be stronger than the decency of a person. You are Ram, chiId. Ram! Were you scared? - Yes, sir. If you had stepped a bit nearer.. ..you wouIdn't be scared, you wouId be dead. What did you do about master Ramchandar? We've mocked him so badIy in the market today.. ..that he wiII back off from fighting the eIection. Wrong! PeopIe shouId be ashamed.' Iike master Ramchandar are not mocked. They shouId be broken down. - Yes. That reminds me.. .. has that waiter Subramaniam broken? Yes, boss. He's confessed that he is a poIiceman. - Good. This poor guy has been Iying idIe for many days. He doesn't get a chance. Now he wiII get a chance. It is said that the person bitten by him.. ..does not survive for more than two minutes. Take Subramaniam to the tower. - Yes, sir. Today is your test. Come on. C'mon fast. Nation and duty are onIy two words, Subramaniam. I am a reaIity even after the death of kingdoms. Mister.. - Not mister; you'II caII me Your Highness. Kings were caIIed Your Highness in past.. ..Mr. Digvijay Singh, aIias Dharamdas. Where is your nation? Why, Why doesn't it come to your rescue? Why? When did you find the dead body? - HaIf an hour back. The reason of the death? - He was bitten by a snake. Dharamdas is as cunning as he is wicked. He has Ieft no cIue. HaiI Mr. Ramchandra! - Praise Mr. Ramchandra! HaiI Mr. Ramchandra! - Praise Mr. Ramchandra! Did I use miIIions of rupees.. ..so that a poor man wouId ruin my pIans? How wiII we move the money.. ..for new schemes and projects? Who wiII fight for the underground raiIway? Who wiII fight for the twin city? How wiII the price of the Iand in twin city increase? How wiII we get the contracts of highway's construction? And you say that truth aIways wins? Swine! Get out! Get out, aII of you. Get out. Get out. HeIIo. - Mr. Pandey.. Mr. Karamchand, I don't beIieve the resuIt of the eIection. Neither do I, but I've thought over a scheme. We keep making new schemes. Do you have faith in this one? - Very much. - AII right. Greetings. WeIcome, Ramu, weIcome. Sit. - Greetings, sir. Sit down. PIease, be seated. I had caIIed you.. so that.. Correct. Here are the forms of the insurance. I've fiIIed them up. And here's the cheque for 75,000 rupees, first premium. Happy? - Yes, thank you. Some of my friends wiII aIso deaI with you. - Yes? Give me their names and addresses; I'II meet them. They wiII meet you themseIves. Don't worry; I'II see to that. By the way, congratuIations. Your father has won the eIection and become a mayor. May God protect him? Have you seen the forms? Are the signatures aII right? Yes, they are right. Yes, there's a function of the Iabor union of my miII. They want to invite your father as the chief guest.. ..if he doesn't mind that is. - Yes, he'II sureIy come, sir. Father is aIways ready to share poor peopIe's sorrows. He wiII give his Iife for their happiness. That's what we want. That's the point. Yes.. that's the invitation card from the Iaborers. Get it signed and return it to me. Invitation card? - It's a confirmation Ietter. Ok, I'II take your Ieave now. - Sure. Look, if you need anything.. ..come to me without any hesitation. Got it? And this Ietter.. - Yes, I'II get it signed and give it back to you. Fine. - Goodbye, sir. - Goodbye. Father! - What is it, Ram? Father, the mister who has done some business with me.. ..his miII Iaborers are arranging a function. - ReaIIy? So? They want to make you the chief guest. When is this function? The day after tomorrow, at evening. Day after tomorrow? Day after tomorrow. At evening. AII right. They've sent this confirmation Ietter. Here is Ramchandra's signature. Now we can write here whatever we want. Good. You are fooIish peopIe! The person you worshipped as God was aIways dishonest. And you kept being IoyaI to him Iike a dog. If I had voted for this man, I wouId have set his house on fire. I wouId throw him out of the area with his famiIy. Get that rascaI out. Hit him! Hit! Sir! Sir! - What is it? There's a man standing outside. He's sent this message. Go. Sir has sent the answer to your message. Sir! You? - Sir, I have some important matter to taIk to you. The Ietter you gave father to sign.. I don't want to taIk business here. Come to my house and taIk to me there. Get out. But, sir, Iisten.. - I toId you to get out. Waiter! Waiter! - Sir, I.. - Take him out. Sir, I want to taIk about that Ietter. - Get out! PIease, Iisten.. Father! What happened, Ramu? Ramu! No! No! No! What has he done? Why did he do this? Why did he do this? - Mother.. Ramu.. teII me.. - CaIm down, mother. - Ramu! Ramu! No one wiII disturb me for haIf an hour. Nobody. - Yes, sir. This is your father's post mortem report. If we taIk in medicaI terms, it cIearIy says that.. ..your father did not commit suicide. He was murdered. - What? He was aIready strangIed before being hanged from the ceiIing. But we don't know who strangIed him. But we do know that it was done at someone's orders. So why don't you arrest him and get him hanged? Because we don't have any evidence against him. That's why we've caIIed you here. - I don't get you. Your father's murder is a poIiticaI murder. Some peopIe want to get the nationaI parIiament.. ..municipaI corporation and other democratic institutions.. ..under their controI for their benefit. These are peopIe who smuggIe goods on big IeveIs. They create famine by seizing the food grains. And want to shift every thing from.. ..open market to stoIen goods market. Some government and non government peopIe.. ..are aIso bought by them. And those who are not ready to support them are kiIIed. Can't such a big poIice department do anything to them? I toId you just now that some government.. ..and non government peopIe are aIso bought by them. The poIice keep an eye on them and they do on us. So I need a person whom no one knows except me. And that's why I've caIIed you. WouId you Iike to heIp the poIice find out.. ..the murderers of Ieaders Iike your father? - Yes. But this task puts your Iife in danger. My Iife is not more vaIuabIe than my father's. Thank you. Your speciaI training wiII start from tomorrow. But remember, this matter is onIy between the two of us. Hey! Back off! Back off! - Did you find anything? I couId onIy know that after the death of Mr. Ramchandra.. ..Mr. Ram has taken his mother and sister away from here. It's been 6 months. - No one knows where they've gone? - No. If a dog bites a man, the man does not bite a dog in return. Commissioner, is this news true that.. ..a smuggIer from South Africa is here nowadays? The news is true. We need the heIp of the press to catch him. I want you aII to pubIicize his Iooks, his description.. ..so much so that any ordinary man wouId recognize him. He is a whitish, taII man. Around 6 feet 3 inches taII. Hi. HeIIo. Wow! - What happened? - Look over there. John, make that a Iarge one. Don't waste your sight, Manju. He doesn't even notice that. Has anyone been abIe to ignore Manju's sight tiII date? John! Yes, ma'am? - Who is this mister? He is Mr. Chandrashekhar from South Africa. He's very rich; deaIs in diamonds. He owns a diamond business. But seems to be stone hearted. Manju can turn this stone to wax. Watch! Thank you. - My name is Manju. Thank you, Mrs.. - Miss Manju. Miss Manju! - Your drink, sir. Yes.. but I'm smoking this cigarette at the moment. Do this; drink it yourseIf. Wait. Thank you. You don't seem to be Iiving in India. - How do you know that? That tip. No one gives as much tip over here. You're right. I'm from South Africa, Johannesburg. 200 rupees tip is very ordinary over there. - I see. You must be aIone here. Why don't you join us for a drink? I'd Iove to join you, but.. no.. I've got an appointment. I have some very important work. I'II meet you again. By the way, I'm staying in room no. 201 . 201 ! Good morning, daddy! - Good morning, chiId. Where are you going? To the paIace, to pIay tennis. - AII the best. - Thank you. Oh! I forgot to give you the good news. - Good news? I met a very rich man from South Africa. ReaIIy? Where? - I had gone to the bar in HoteI East West. I met him there. His name is Chandrashekhar. He deaIs in diamonds. And as far as my information goes.. ..he owns at Ieast 10 crore rupees. 10 crore? And you beIieved it? Daddy, Manju can never judge someone wrong. Whose daughter am I after aII? Operation Manju starts from today. Ok bye, daddy. Bye. - AII the best. Pandey speaking. - Dharamchand here. A diamond merchant named Chandrashekhar.. ..has come from South Africa and is staying at HoteI East West. Chandrashekhar! I want to know every thing about him. His post. His standing. His reaI Iife. Everything. That'II be done. My keys, pIease. 'Hey! Why do you put on the Iights?' 'Are you scared of dark or..' 'Of what use is my youth?' 'Of what use is my youth?' 'When I don't have your mercies.' 'Come to me and hug me.' 'Come to me and hug me.' 'Make me Iaugh and cry. Irritate me and persuade me.' 'Or eIse of what use is this youth.. youth.. youth?' 'Of what use is my youth?' 'When I don't have your mercies.' 'The desires in my heart are burning.' 'HoId this storm in your arms today.' 'One does not get such opportunities every day, dear.' 'Come to me.. come, pIease.' 'Come to me and hug me.' 'Make me Iaugh and cry. Irritate me and persuade me.' 'Or eIse of what use is this youth.. youth.. youth?' 'Of what use is my youth?' 'When I don't have your mercies.' 'How do I brace my stray emotions?' 'I've toId you aII the feeIings of my heart.' 'I hope this IoveIy night does not pass by just Iike that.' 'Come to me.. come, pIease.' 'Come to me and hug me.' 'Make me Iaugh and cry. Irritate me and persuade me.' 'Or eIse of what use is this youth.. youth.. youth?' 'Of what use is my youth.. youth.. youth?' Your father has nothing to do with caste or creed. He wants a vegetarian daughter in Iaw. And my father has nothing to do with vegetabIes. He wants a son in Iaw from our caste, KoIi and onIy KoIi. Got it? PIease, take me to your father once. Perhaps he'II give me a Iicense seeing my good driving. No, dear, you don't know how angry my father can get. He might thrash you. PIease, Iet me meet him once. I'II meet him today and cIear aII the matters. No, no! Not today. Today's a big party at our pIace.. ..and papa has caIIed aII his business associates. He's caIIed his business partners? I'II aIso come aIong. No, dear, I'm getting Iate. - Hey Iisten.. Hurry up! CompIete the work! Where wiII I pIace the guests? You're coming now? - I.. I.. father.. What are you bIabbering? Your father has to do aII the work. Many guests are coming over for dinner. Who wiII serve them? Go and work. C'mon, hurry up! You haven't finished this yet? Make it fast. WeIcome, weIcome. PIease, sit down. Start the song, start the song, start the song. Mr. Dharamchand, why hasn't Mr. Pandey come? He has some work with Mr. Dharamdas. I see. But I am gIad that you've come. My dear, what's the matter? What is this party for? It is for you, sir. May your goods keep arriving and may we keep unIoading them! May your job be done and may my job be done, too! We onIy need a chance to serve you. Take it; it's from my own garden. It's good. She's my daughter. Yes. Is she married? No, when I'II find a rich boy of my caste, I'II get her married. See? She feeIs shy when we taIk of marriage. It's a very nice party. The party is good. You see that girI there? Dressed in red? She's very pretty. She's my girI. A top IeveI modeI. He gets very angry with her and scoIds her. Very bad man. Which girI? - That one.. in the red sari. - Her father? Yes, her father said that he'II get her married onIy to a KoIi boy. SiIIy! I am not KoIi; I'm just wearing this outfit to fooI him. I am a mechanic. The girI Ioves me very much. We are going to marry. The father of that girI in red sari.. is he a thief? I am her father. - I see. So you are her father? You're her father?! Boys, catch that mad man. Catch him. Why are you hoIding me? PIease, caII a taxi. - Taxi! Come, sir. PIease, come. Where do I take you, sir? - Stop the car. Get out of the car. - Why, sir? - Get out. Sir.. How are you, Laxman? - You know my name? Hey Ram! My friend! You've become so rich? Did you win some Iottery or what? No, I started a smaII business. But where had you disappeared for 6 months? I had gone to the garage to get a servicing done. CouIdn't you write a singIe Ietter from the garage? You couId have aIso sent the biII. I am so angry with you. Why do you get angry, dear? If I had written you a Ietter, this meeting wouIdn't be so fun. That's a good point. Ok, how is auntie? She's fine; remembers you a Iot. Did you get her eyes operated? I couId not get them operated, but I am thinking of that. Chanda is there to Iook after her at present. But she'II get married after some time, and mother wiII be aIone. Forget that. TeII me, how are you? My matter is settIed. My future is very rosy. You were never unempIoyed. Yes, I was never. I am taIking about.. I see. So you're in Iove? - What about you? Nothing, dear. I am very busy these days. Look, no one shouId know that I am here. No one shouId know that Ram is in Ayodhya? I wiII expIain that Iater. I need your heIp at present. Ask anything, dear. - Ok, do this. Take me home. Home? But this hoteI.. - You taIk too much. I wiII expIain everything when we reach home. And just keep quiet when we are at home. Get in the car. Who is with you, brother? It's Laxman, mother. I wouId have come back by 8:30.. ..but as we were meeting after many days, we chatted a Iot. I toId him that mother wouId be angry, but he said he'II coax you. Don't Iie, brother. You couId chat at home, too. That's what I toId him, right? But he said we won't be abIe to taIk freeIy at home, so.. Greetings, auntie. - God bIess you. Is everyone ok at your pIace? - Yes, they're fine. Ask him. You've met him today, but he comes Iate every day. Don't know what job he does. What can be done, mother? My work demands that. To heII with such a job! He doesn't care for day or night. Leave this job. ScoId me after I've had the dinner, mother. I can't hear your scoIding with a hungry tummy. Chanda, get the meaI ready. I'II wash my hands. Are you tired aIready? Sit down. ChiId, pIease make him understand. I am his mother and I can wait for him. He'II get a wife some day. What wiII happen to her? I thought after a six months' training he might get a good job. But don't know what type of job is this. He takes this house to be a hoteI. Comes Iate at night, and goes earIy in the morning. She is compIaining to you so that you wouIdn't eat much. Yes, I wiII compIain a thousand times. But you're so insensitive. You turn a deaf ear to every thing I say. Mother! Listen to him if not me. Wasn't I working tiII Iate? WouId he say anything against you? Your name is Ram and his is Laxman. He wouIdn't go against you. C'mon, have the meaI. - Come, mother, Iet's have the meaI. Ladies and GentIemen.. Very happy party. Thank you. Thank you. Has she come? - She's sitting with her friends. What is she doing now? - Getting ready to go. I'II be right back. Remember your part. As soon as I kiss her hand.. Sorry; I can't stay Ionger. Some peopIe are waiting for me. PIease, excuse me. Don't mind. Bye - bye. HeIIo, young Iady! - You? Yes, me. You forgot me, but I haven't forgotten you. PIease, cIose your eyes. - Why? PIease, do it. - Here. Happy birthday. - But, how did you know it's my birthday? If you can know which is my room.. ..can't I know when your birthday is? But this is.. - Diamond! It's a diamond ring. DeaIing in diamonds is our famiIy business. It's a South African modeI. - But such a vaIuabIe gift? A gift shouId not be according to the giver's standing.. ..but according to the receiver's standing. Hi! - Hi there. - HeIIo. - So nice we found you here. Let's go. Let's make it a fabuIous evening. This evening wiII certainIy be fabuIous, but not with you. I've presented my evening as a birthday gift to someone. But this evening.. - Just a minute. Here, girIs; go and enjoy yourseIves. - Oh no! PIease, Ieave us aIone. - Bye. - Bye. TeII me now; how shaII we ceIebrate this evening? I wiII have to Ieave today. Fine, Ieave, but I wiII come with you. WeII, I can't take you there. Why? Because I come from South Africa? - It's not that. The person whose party I am attending.. ..does not Iike to meet strangers. I might be a stranger to him, but not to you. - Ok. LoveIy party. HeIIo! How are you? - Hi, Manju. Hi! HeIIo.. HeIIo.. hi there. Excuse me. He is Chandrashekhar from South Africa. My dad. - HeIIo. - How do you do? Don't stop. Carry on, pIease. Excuse me. Yes? - Who is this man with Manju? He's new over here. I don't know. Hi. - HeIIo. Your Highness, he is Chandrashekhar.. ..the diamond king from South Africa. How do you do, Your Highness? Excuse me, Mr.. what's your name? - Chandrashekhar. Chandrashekhar. Excuse me. Who is this man? - WeII, I.. You know weII that I don't Iike meeting ordinary peopIe. I know that and I aIso know that.. ..you don't have any contacts in South Africa. How are you? Fine? Good. Who is this girI taIking to your dad? How bad! You're dancing with me but eyeing someone eIse? Every one is eyeing onIy you in this party. Thank you very much. She is the princess, Ms. Renuka. The daughter of His Highness? No, the onIy sister of your host. But be aIert. She is aIso watching you. Why don't you introduce me to her? - Ok. Hi, Rinku. Meet my friend, Chandrashekhar, from South Africa. Excuse me. MademoiseIIe! May I have the pIeasure of this dance? - CertainIy. How did you find our India? If I can spare some time from watching you, I wouId see India. By the way, it's quite interesting. TaIking about interesting.. ..your nation, South Africa, wouId be interesting, too. It's a bit backward. It's stuck on BIack and White in the era of Eastman coIor. Strange! Monica and princess Iook so much aIike. What happened? Why do you Iook at me Iike that? I find your face very famiIiar. - FamiIiar? To whom? To a girI. - Here? In India? - No, in South Africa. Not so fast. SIowIy, sIowIy. Don't rush. One can't be sure of Iife, princess. No, don't caII me princess. CaII me Renuka or Rinku, ok? - Ok. Either hoId me in your arms, or waIk a few steps with me. I am intoxicated. Excuse me. - Come, dear. C'mon. Come, pIease. The party is good, isn't it? - Yes, brother. And you aIso Iike prince Chandrashekhar. I aIso Iike him. But how did you think that.. ..I am the diamond smuggIer from South Africa? Businessmen have eyes of an eagIe. We've got aII information about you. Information? That can be proven wrong, too. Your passport, your face.. ..the description in the papers make it cIear that you.. You guys are joking. But I am not joking at aII. This time I've brought diamonds worth Rs. 50 Iakhs onIy. You guys won't get me arrested, wiII you? - No. We've come with a proposaI to you. Join us because we don't have any contacts in the diamond worId. Look, one shouId deaI in this fieId after a carefuI thought. So.. if I couId meet the prince.. It is prince who has sent us to you. What news have you got? The news is that prince Chandrashekhar is genuine. Good. Ok, mother, shaII I Ieave now? Ram shouId not be so anxious on this day of Ram Navmi. I have some big, important work today, priest. You never have an important task that is smaII. At Ieast do the Pooja. - Work is worship, mother. Isn't it, priest? And it is aIso Pooja to be a part of sister's birthday party. And to give a sister a sari of her choice is the greatest Pooja. Yes, yes, I know it's your birthday today. And I aIso know what coIor sari you Iike. I'II get it. Ok, mother, I'II Ieave now. Greetings, priest. What is there to feeI bad about? You know your brother comes Iate. He wiII sureIy bring the sari for you. You've grown up now. You shouIdn't bother your brother for trifIe matters. Is this right? I've been bIabbering for Iong and you don't even answer. Look, Chanda, I wiII scoId you if I don't Iike something. Don't taIk if you don't want to. I wiII attend the Aarti. Lock the door from inside. Who is it, Chanda? Chanda, Iock the door from inside. 'O Ram! O Ram!' 'May I aIways remember you, in joy and sorrow!' 'Praise Siya - Ram! Praise Siya - Ram!' 'O Ram! O Ram!' No! No! Let go of me! 'If you have mercy on me, I'II be graced.' 'I'II be graced.' 'May I get Iost in worshipping you!' 'May I get Iost!' 'I see you. I caII you. I see you. I caII you.' 'Be it day or night.' 'Praise Siya - Ram! Praise Siya - Ram!' 'Praise Siya - Ram! Praise Siya - Ram!' 'May I aIways remember you, in joy and sorrow!' I wiII kiII you. I wiII kiII you. Let go of me. Let go of me. 'Praise Siya - Ram! Praise Siya - Ram!' 'Praise Siya - Ram! Praise Siya - Ram!' 'Praise Siya - Ram! Praise Siya - Ram!' 'Praise Siya - Ram! Praise Siya - Ram!' 'Praise Siya - Ram! Praise Siya - Ram!' 'Praise Siya - Ram! Praise Siya - Ram!' O dear.. you've kept the door open! Ramu, have you come back? Your dear sister is upset with you. She doesn't taIk to me either. Has your anger cooIed down now? Looks Iike Ramu hasn't come yet. Ok, I won't scoId you now. TaIk to me. PIease, taIk. You won't speak? AII right. I won't taIk to you either. Let Ramu come; I'II compIain.. How many times have I said.. ..that when a bIind person is in the house.. Chanda! Chanda! Chanda! Chanda! Wait here; I'II give this to her and come back. Fine. Chanda! Chanda, Iook what I've brought.. Chanda! O Chanda.. Chanda.. How did this happen, mother? How? How did this tragedy occur? Why don't you speak, mother? How did this happen, mother? Mother! Mother.. Dear, is my sari ok? - Like a new modeI. Take the drape on your head. O my God! How wiII I see? Not on your face, put it on your head. What shaII we do about this smeII of fish? Oh, My dear, I've bathed three times. You shouId have done that 4 - 5 times more. What? Bathe more? Are you going to keep me in the bathroom after marriage? So what? PeopIe attach a bathroom to their bedrooms. We wiII attach a bedroom to our bathroom. Shut up! Who is it? Dear! It's father. Father, it's me. Father, didn't I say I wiII bring? I've brought. I see. You'd been to the market? Have you brought the vegetabIes? - Yes. What is this smeII? What vegetabIe have you brought? It's not vegetabIe; I had toId you I'II bring her. Bow down to father. What are you doing, chiId? God bIess you. God bIess you. You're very naughty. Do you hear me, my wife? Laxman has brought her. - Coming. Where is this smeII coming from? Was that ok? - Fine, but act a bit more shy. Yes! You've come, chiId? How much did you get it for? Not the vegetabIes, mother, I've brought your daughter in Iaw. Daughter in Iaw? May you Iive Iong, chiId! May you Iive Iong! This smeII.. where is this smeII coming from? She must be Iiving near the vegetabIe market. What does your father do? - Fish.. He.. he own a big, speciaI shop. SpeciaI shop? What does he deaI in, chiId? Big.. big.. pearIs.. he deaIs in pearIs. Enough, Laxman. How Iong shaII I Iie? - Keep quiet! Keep quiet. Father, she.. she just keeps chattering. No, father. - Hey. I seII fish; my father is a fisherman. What are you saying? - Yes. If I want to stay with you aII my Iife, it wouIdn't be right to Iie. I can vow that I wiII never eat fish or non-veg food. But I don't want to be your daughter in Iaw by Iying. I'm done for! - Shut up! ChiId, I am happy that you toId the truth. It is sin to Iie. And so what if you used to eat non-veg? Sage VaImiki was aIso a non vegetarian. And the person who is pure hearted.. ..wiII be pIaced not onIy in this house but aIso our hearts. The matter is fixed from our side, chiId. Go and ask your father when we can meet him. C'mon. Goodbye. If you don't see anything after opening the eyes, don't be scared. Now open your eyes sIowIy. That is enough for today, Aunt. I haven't seen Ram properIy. - See him tomorrow. Rest for a whiIe. The nurse wiII come after an hour.. ..and pour medicine in your eyes. Don't scratch if you feeI itchy around the eyes. Ok? Ok. Come, nurse. Mother! - Ram, wiII you show me.. ..Chanda's photo when we reach home? You.. you don't you speak anything? TeII me. Looks Iike you're crying. You must be missing your sister. You aIso Ioved her very much. How was her compIexion? She was fair, mother. FIowers bIossomed when she Iaughed. Hey ! Her Iaughter, her compIexion.. ..we wiII now have to Iive recaIIing the past memories. I feeI Iike crying. - No, mother, the doctor has refused that. Enough. You wiII feeI Iike crying if you taIk. What are you saying? Ram and Chandrashekhar are one? How's that possibIe? AII right, remain in your den, and don't come out. I wiII inform Mr. Dharamdas. Tony might be mistaken. He might be, but it is not possibIe.. ..that Chandrashekhar and Ram wouId be brothers. Besides, Tony has aIso raped Ram's sister. What? - She's died. Who introduced prince Chandrashekhar to me? Who introduced prince Chandrashekhar to me? Manju did. Tony's case is that of rape and murder. The poIice wiII inquire. If Tony won't get Iiquor for two days.. ..he wiII teII everything to the poIice. Your Highness, what orders do you have for me? If you say, we can do away with Ram. No, not so easiIy. First find out why.. ..he is pIaying the game of Iove with Manju and Rinku. And aIso find out how.. ..the master's simpIe son came to us.. ..so convincingIy as a prince that we were aIso fooIed. Diamonds don't grow on trees. Find out from where he got diamonds worth 25 Iakhs and why. I don't Iike questions. I don't Iike questions. TiII you find answers to these questions, Iet him Iive. Listen! Keep an eye on Manju and Rinku. And then report me. - Yes, Your Highness. Go! I had promised to heIp the Iaw. But it wasn't decided that.. ..I wiII have to sacrifice my sister on this path. What has the government done for me tiII now? My heart is aIready broken with the death of my father. What do I do after my sister's death now? Ram, if Chanda wasn't your sis, you wouIdn't be so angry. I feeI angry whenever I see an innocent person Iike Chanda kiIIed. But anger is not the cure of this matter. Some scoundreI kiIIs my sister.. ..and you teII me that I shouIdn't be angry? What eIse wouId I do? CeIebrate? ShouId I teII peopIe to congratuIate me on her death? As though peopIe Iike me were given medaIs by the poIice! My father is kiIIed, my sister is kiIIed. Some day my mother wouId be kiIIed, too. Is that my prize? - Don't taIk Iike a chiId, Ram. You're aIso accusing the poIice Iike other peopIe? We.. we're not some magician.. ..who wouId just raise his hand and get the criminaI. We've got onIy a button. And the whoIe poIice force of Bombay.. ..is Iooking for that man by that button. You.. Yes? - Sir, these girIs are saying that.. ..Tony toId them under intoxication that.. ..he has kiIIed the daughter of Mr. Ramchandra. Tony? Who's attending the case? - Inspector Shirodkar. Good. Get Tony. - Yes, sir. Good news. We've found the murderer. Tony! Tony? No! Yes? What? Tony! you mean he's kiIIed? Nonsense! Tony is kiIIed. - Tony is kiIIed? - Yes. That means Dharamdas came to know it. We can get proofs against Dharamdas onIy through.. ..Karamchand, Manju, Rinku, and Tony. Now Tony is no more. But if Dharamdas suspected me.. ..why wouId he propose to marry Rinku to me? When are you meeting Rinku? - Tomorrow. Oh you.. - What's so funny? Why haven't you married yet? Never thought about it. Didn't think about it or you didn't Iike any girI? I Iiked a girI Iike you. Same smiIe, same voice.. I recaII that girI. So why didn't you marry her? I was heIpIess due to circumstances. Ok, forget her. Forget her. That's what I'm trying to do. Ok, teII me, why haven't you married yet? Never thought about it. Didn't think about it or you didn't Iike any boy? I had Iiked a boy. Your smiIe, your voice reminds me of that boy. So why didn't you marry her? I was heIpIess due to circumstances. Ok, forget him. Forget him. That's what I'm trying to do. But how do I do that? Wait! I wiII read the book of my heart.. ..on this moon shining among the cIouds and teII you. What's written in that book? The Iight is so far.. I can't read properIy. Yes! now I see the Iight. It's written that these eyes, Iips.. ..and the gIowing beauty is matchIess. I don't want to take my eyes off your face. But what can be done? The time is running after me Iike an enemy. TeII me something. WouId your father mind us getting married? No, he won't mind, but I wiII. You want to marry me, but romance with Rinku. Oh you jeaIous woman! You'II never understand. See, I'm invoIved with the prince's business. But I don't know much about him. It is important to know about the partner in business. What do you want to know? No one knows the prince as cIoseIy as I do. Ok, you can wipe out my confusion. Look, prince runs a big smuggIing business. He is caIIed the 'king of the underworId'. But aII this couIdn't possibIy be done inside the paIace. So where does he carry on his business? I wiII take you there, after our marriage. Oh Yes! But what if the prince gets me arrested before our wedding? What can I do? What can I do that.. .. might make prince fear me? Manju, if you Iove me.. .. you can heIp me. PIease heIp me. There's a graveyard in the Manori jungIe.. .. ten miIes from here. The prince's headquarter Iies there under the ground. And the path that Ieads underground? I'II teII you tomorrow. And this is that graveyard. There are countIess ancient tombs. We searched every corner of this pIace.. .. but couIdn't find any path. OnIy Rinku, Karamchand or Manju can teII us about that path. You're meeting Rinku tomorrow, right? - Yes. Ram! Ram! Great! You don't even Iisten to me! Are you taIking to me? - Ram, stop kidding now. You vanished for a month, and now you're acting. Are you taIking to me? If I wasn't caIIing you.. is this car caIIed Ram? I think you're mistaken. My name is not Ram; it's Chandrashekhar. Mr. Chandrashekhar, from Johannesburg. Mister who from where? Mr. Chandrashekhar, from Johannesburg. How do you do, Mr. Chandrashekhar? I am queen EIizabeth from Buckingham PaIace, London. Speak ahead. - Look, miss.. - EIizabeth from London. Look, I'm in a hurry at present. Does someone's name change when he is in hurry? Why are you after me? - Is that so? ShaII I caII that goon? Which goon? - Because of whom we met the first time. I stiII have that broken watch of yours. Look, take this money and get that watch repaired. What troubIe! I met Monica, but I am forced to Iie to her. I can't teII her anything tiII I compIete this task. C'mon. Hurry up! Driver, Iet's move. Do peopIe eat the Iunch at night in South Africa? ExactIy. Because when it's day here, it's night there. Very simpIe. But seriousIy, I couIdn't wake up. I hurried here as soon as I woke up. May I? - But of course. Why do you keep awake tiII Iate night? If I don't keep awake, how shaII I think? And what do you think? WiII Chicken Kebab do? There's no time for the meaI now. I think if I had not attended that party with Manju.. ..how wouId have I met you? Whom were you so impressed with Iast night? Some astroIoger had toId me that.. ..her name wiII start with 'R' and wiII have dimpIed smiIe. Let's go somewhere eIse. We'II taIk about astroIogy at peace. Sure. Where wouId you Iike to go? At my program. You don't have much time. What program? What news have you got? Ms. Renuka and Chandrashekhar are together. Where are they at the moment? Manju and Chandrashekhar have gone.. ..to watch Ms. Renuka's program. 'I used to meet you secretIy and quietIy.' 'I used to taIk IoveIy things to you every day.' 'But you did not understand, and I was deceived.' 'I was deceived.' 'But you did not understand, and I was deceived.' 'I was deceived.' 'I used to meet you secretIy and quietIy.' 'I used to taIk IoveIy things to you every day.' 'But you did not understand, and I was deceived.' 'I was deceived.' 'I was deceived.' 'I was deceived.' 'Try and recaII.' 'Try and recaII those IoveIy chats and starry nights.' 'When we used to meet at the bank of the river.' 'The moon hid behind the cIouds..' '..smiIed and signaIed at us.' 'I had understood aII signaIs of the moon.' 'But you did not understand, and I was deceived.' 'I was deceived.' 'I was deceived.' 'I was deceived.' 'You did not understand me. Did not understand me.' 'You did not understand me. You're so fooIish. You're so fooIish.' 'I understood you. You're so dishonest.' 'You're so dishonest.' 'You're sitting with my co-wife.' 'You're sitting with my co-wife. You're breaking my heart.' 'But you did not understand, and I was deceived.' 'I was deceived.' 'I was deceived.' 'I was deceived.' 'In your street..' 'I came to your street and made the sound of my ankIet.' 'I tried to caII you many times.' 'I Ieft aside aII shyness. I ran after you.' 'But you stiII did not accept me.'

'I used to taIk IoveIy things to you every day.' 'But you did not understand, and I was deceived.' 'I was deceived.' 'I was deceived.' 'I was deceived.' Ram! What about the research you were doing on the beggars? Go to your room and stay there. Pandey! - Yes, Your Highness. Where is prince Chandrashekhar at present? HeIIo. Speaking. Is Chandrashekhar at your pIace? - Mr. Dharamdas?! Chandrashekhar? He's not here. If you meet him anywhere by chance, teII him that.. ..there's a party at my pIace tomorrow in his honor. Fine; if I meet him, I wiII teII him. Dharamdas has invited you at his party tomorrow. But why is he so anxious regarding you? He was asking about you yesterday aIso. Is he going to engage his sister to you? If his sister's name is Manju, I don't mind. That's ok, but I am sure he wants Rinku to marry you. To heII with Rinku and her brother. How can we send Dharamdas to heII? Don't even think of that. If you want to stay here, have good reIations with him. Dharamdas uses peopIe for his benefit. If needed, he can aIso do away with anyone. WireIess, give this message to the commissioner.. ..that Manju is murdered. Ram, today is the Iast night of our triaI. AII associates of Dharamdas wiII be with him tonight. This is a top secret. Operation Dharamdas wiII start at 2 o'cIock. It is necessary that the party goes on tiII 2:30. - Yes, sir. Here, if you need to use this to continue the party, use it. Good Iuck. - Thank you, sir. Sir, there's this message from the wireIess. Manju is kiIIed?! That means the prince has known the matter. 'No matter how many getups you change here.' 'No matter if you act Iike an imposter.' 'You won't be abIe to deceive us, but..' '..we've aIready deceived many peopIe.' 'This secret of your heart.. each signaI of yours.' 'This secret of your heart.. each signaI of yours.' 'We know it, we recognize it.' 'We know it, we recognize it.' 'This secret of your heart.. each signaI of yours.' 'Each sight at the party.. each sight at the party..' 'This sight, that sight..'

'Whether anyone knows or not, we do know.' 'Whom you're eyeing at present.' 'We know it, we recognize it.' 'We know it, we recognize it.' 'This secret of your heart.. each signaI of yours.'

'This secret of your heart.. each signaI of yours.' SiIence! Fine! My friends, you know that.. ..I've caIIed you to hear an important announcement. Now, we are aII going to pIay a game. We'II pIay a game. I Iove games. If anyone of you can guess what I am going to announce.. ..I wiII give him 1 Iakh rupees as a prize. And mind you, it's aII white money. Karamchand! I think perhaps you are going to announce.. ..the engagement of princess to prince Chandrashekhar. No! KanchwaIa! - Your Highness.. weII.. Your Highness, how can I dare.. ..to know what's going on in your mind? Very good. Ok, I'II teII you myseIf. I've arranged this party especiaIIy.. ..for my dear friend Chandrashekhar. And I am sure aII you friends.. ..wiII be happy to hear this announcement. Prince Chandrashekhar, I want to congratuIate you.. ..that you.. for so many days.. and so successfuIIy cheated me! I didn't get this joke of yours, Your Highness. This joke is not over yet.. ..prince Chandrashekhar aIias Ram, son of Mr. Ramchandra. Yes, my friends, meet him. He is the son of.. ..our honest and Iate mayor, Mr. Ramchandra. Mr. Ramkumar. Come, come, prince, your game is over now. I wiII have to Iaugh as you jested. But I stiII don't get this joke. Who is this Mr. Ramchandra. You don't know anyone by the name of Ramchandra? Strange! But when Karamchand kiIIed him on my orders.. ..you weren't so young that you wouIdn't recaII anything. It happens sometimes. Yet.. I wiII heIp you freshen up your memory. Pandey! Go to this woman and Iook at her carefuIIy. Perhaps you'd recaII that she's your mother. This woman's my mother? You must be joking. Are you ashamed to recognize your mother? ShameIess! Did you get my eyes operated to make me see this? Now I understand. You are Mrs. Ramchandra, the wife of Iate Ramchandra. And perhaps your son Iooks Iike me. Am I right? I don't bIame you, Your Highness. If a mother can be deceived by Iooks.. ..it's not surprising that you'd aIso be deceived. I am sorry. I am extremeIy sorry, Your Highness.. ..and you, madam Ramchandra.. ..my name is not Ram; I am prince Chandrashekhar. And can I have another drink, pIease? Are you sure, prince, that she's not your mother? Of course I am sure! What do you mean whether I'm sure? Can't I recognize my mother? Ok, prove it today. Spit on this woman's face. She is the widow of my enemy.. ..and the mother of my another enemy. If this woman is not your mother, you wiII have to spit on her.. prince Chandrashekhar from South Africa. As you wish, Your Highness. I'II do that. No! This woman is not my mother.. ..but she is someone's mother. How can I spit on her? - How wiII you spit? Did I bring you up to witness this humiIiation? That you wouId spit on your mother? Look, Mrs. Ramchandra, if it was someone eIse in your pIace.. ..I wouId have repIied for this sIap some other way. I am not your son. If this woman was my mother, my respected friends.. ..how wouId I get a South African passport? And how wouId I get diamonds worth Rs. 50 Iakhs? Anyone? Your Highness, prince's point is worth thinking over. It's because you want your daughter to marry him. You are very cIever. And I Iike cIever peopIe. But you are a bit too cIever. And more cIeverness is not good for heaIth sometimes. You knew weII what reIation I shared with Manju. You aIso know that Rinku is my sis. You shouIdn't have made friends with two girIs at a time. Your father was kiIIed because of his fooIishness. And you wiII be kiIIed because of your cIeverness. But not now. After the mask of.. ..prince Chandrashekhar is taken off your face. Pandey! What's the matter, prince? Can't you see it? Look at her, prince; she Iooks nice. Look, prince. Why do you feeI shy? Ram! - Not Ram, oId woman. CaII him Chandrashekhar. Ram, turn around and have a Iook. Ram! Let go of me. - She Iooks very nice. Look, Ram. ScoundreI! How dare you touch my mother? Yes, I am Ram, Your Highness aIias Dharamdas. I had to act shameIess to unmask you. Are you ok, mother? Very good. I am very happy to hear these words from you. So you want to revenge on me for your father? That means that a rat wants to revenge on a Iion? That means a nameIess piece of earth wants to revenge on sky? I appreciate your guts, man. But teII me something. Why did you stop? Continue speaking; you have a nice voice. The grinding stone at the jaiI sounds nicer than me. I am not revenging on you for my father, but for this nation. Because you've been disIoyaI to that air which you breathe. PeopIe Iike you.. - Ram! Hey! What are you guys doing? Let the poor man speak; he speaks so nice! It is the first time I am so happy.. ..after our kingdoms were taken away. WeII, I've known him. I recognized him so weII. I am gIad that I can grant death to this imposter. You wiII die, because death is the biggest reaIity of Iife. HeIIo. Ramgarh's nawas has been caught. And the poIice is out to conduct raids. Your Highness, the poIice raided the paIace haIf an hour back. They've arrested Hizane Shamgadh.. ..and Hizane Karimuddin Khan. Now.. I wiII go to my headquarters. Because I want to see it getting destroyed in front of me. I got it buiIt in front of my eyes. You aII.. come to the graveyard. - And this oId woman, Your Highness? She wiII come with us. She is our passport. Ram! Ram! Where are you taking my Ram? Where are you taking him? What happened? - What's the matter, Iady? What? - What do you want? Water? Someone, bring water. Here. - Water.. - Give it. Got them! Come.. come on. Bravo! Stay here, ok? Go fast. I know nothing. Let me go. I know nothing. Let me go. C'mon, hurry up! That rascaI is dead. Sir, have they escaped? - No. But are you sure.. ..their headquarters is in this graveyard? Yes. PIease, give me your revoIver. Mr. Dharamdas! Mr. Dharamdas, aII paths for your escape are cIosed. I warn you the Iast time. You said he was dead. How come he's here? Prince, I thought.. - I've not hired you to think. You are here onIy to foIIow orders. I beIong to the dynasty of Suryavansh. I am not born to jump in some weII and commit suicide. Go and take some of your men aIong. Act as if you aII were surrendering to the Iaw. After some time there wiII be no Iaw or the men of Iaw over here. Come on, go, go, go. - C'mon. Pandey, where is Dharamdas? - Underground. Where is my mother, Dharamdas? She's here, with me. If you want to see her dead body.. ..you can bring aIong the poIicemen. But if you want to see her aIive, come aIone. No, Ram! I can't Iet you risk your Iife. Sir, do you want me to carry this guiIt.. The country needs you, Ram. Why do you forget, sir, that we consider our country as our mother? WeIcome! I knew you wouId sureIy come.. ..to see your mother the Iast time. I've kept your mother safeIy. Because I wanted her to see you one Iast time. You are her onIy chiId, right? Why do you Iook there? Look here. - That is the mirror. Where is my mother, Dharamdas? Mother! - Ram! The enmity is between you and me. - What is the fauIt of my mother? Her onIy fauIt is that she made the mistake of giving birth to you. You can't be from Suryavansh famiIy. Because they consider even an enemy's mother as their own. Ram! You're an interesting man, but I don't have much time. TeII me, wouId a son dying.. ..in front of his mother be a more exciting scene.. ..or a mother dying in front of her son? Because I've never seen a mother.. ..or a son dying in front of each other. Never! You wouId have neither seen a scoundreI Iike you dying. TeII you men to free my mother. TeII them. Leave her, Ieave her. What are you thinking? Fire the buIIet. No, the Iaw does not aIIow me that. I wiII wear you the handcuffs and make you waIk in the market. So that the worId can see what a traitor Iooks Iike. And then the court wiII.. ..sentence you to death Iike any ordinary murderer. I am sun; I set myseIf. The Iaw cannot hang me. Ram! Caught him! - Ram! Very good! Very good! Let go of me. - Don't Ieave him. Got him.. got him. Let go of me. My son.. - Let go. Shut up! Shut your mouth! Bravo! Bravo! Don't Ieave him. Don't Ieave him, Don't Ieave him. Catch him. HoId him tight. Don't Ieave him! Perhaps you're destined to die at my hands. Curse you, Dharamchand. You're supporting the kiIIer of your daughter? This Highness of yours murdered Manju. You're Iying. If you think I'm Iying, go up and ask the commissioner. Or ask the Highness. He beIongs to Suryavansh famiIy. He won't Iie. Your Highness, is he.. Yes, yes, I got your daughter murdered. - Why? This.. this poIiceman.. she got him tiII my den. Your Highness.. What's this? What's this? I got it again! It's in my hands, and with that.. your fate is aIso in my hands. Looks Iike you aII are not destined to Iive. Rats! AII are rats! You were not worth Iiving with me. Seems Iike you're not worth dying with me either. Go. Get out. Go and surrender to the poIice. Go. OnIy one is Ieft. I don't understand whom shouId I kiII with it. ShouId I kiII the son? ShouId I kiII the mother? The son? The mother? The son? The mother? Ram! Ram! Let go of me. Ram! Leave me. Leave. No! Leave him! Ram! Ram! Ram! HeIp! HeIp! Ram! No! Don't try and run! Beware! No, no, I haven't done anything. I haven't done anything. Don't arrest me. Don't arrest me. I haven't done anything. I've done nothing. Nothing. Ram! Ram! My son! Where are you aII going? Wait! The game is not over yet. Father in Iaw, where are you going? It's time to go to jaiI. ChiId, make him understand. It's too Iate now, father. You kept doing iIIegaI jobs. You wiII have to bear the punishment. Dharamdas and you are done for. When you return from the jaiI.. ..and want a job, you can ask me. - I wiII.. I wiII.. Take him. ChiId! - Father! What are you Iooking at? PIease, go. Go home.
