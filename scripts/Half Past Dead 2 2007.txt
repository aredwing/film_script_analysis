Tell me, Twitch. -Who started this? -My name's Twitch... ...and I ain't no snitch. I don't know nothing, man. You're worried? About them? What they could do to you? You should worry more about me. -And what I'm gonna do to you. -Look, man, I'm just working. Just doing my time. Just doing my time. Model citizen. See, Twitch has been here a long time... ...seen lot of shit go down. Like inmates trying to take over. But I slapped them down like little bitches. Nobody wins in my island... ...but me. What do you think, homeys? Should I put any of you in the hole? Shit. Lot of guys like you in the hole... ...guys who think they're tough... ...guys who are beginning to believe... ...they're bigger... ...than my island. You bay beauties... ...you don't know how fucking good you got it. Hey... ...bag of bones. You wouldn't last two weeks in a place like Creighton. -Toughest max-security joint... -Creigh--? ...in the country. In case you never heard of it. It's where society took a shit. And built a 40-foot wall around it. And any of you could end up there... ...with a snap of my fingers. So... ...everybody's on notice. Whoever starts the next fight... ...gets a free ride, no questions asked, to Creighton. Then you can see how bad you really are. Now, get them back to their cages. They're starting to give me indigestion. Come on, line it up and let's move. Lock your chains. Let's go. -That means you too. -Back it up. Creighton, huh? That's in Missouri, ain't it? Hey, Twitch. Heard you got deep-sixed at your parole hearing. Looks like you're not getting out anytime soon. Oh, fuck you, Hubert. I'm out in a month. Mark it on your calendar. While you rot in here, I get the gold. Yeah, I'll be out a lot sooner than you think. Oh, yeah? You gonna dog paddle off this rock? -Oh, I got ways. -A month, Twitch. That's what I got. Yeah? And I got a nice, stern ass-whupping for you... ...if you don't leave me the fuck alone. You. You're gonna move, man? Wanna move a play? No. Shit. Perfect. Hey. What's up, motherfucker? -I'm talking to you, motherfucker. -What do you want, Twitch? I wanna kick your ass. -Man, come on, get your ass up. -You can't be serious. Nigga, you've been talking shit about me. When? What proof you got? I don't need no proof. Man, you sound like a lawyer. How can you see with these motherfuckers on here-- -Give them back. -Fuck, no. Why don't you come get them from me so I could kick your ass? You know I'm out in a month. -I'm not gonna fight you. -Damn. -But my bitch will. -What bitch? Oh, shit. Okay. Here. Hey, you gotta-- Come here. -Fuck, yeah. -Oh, shit. Get up and walk. Get up and walk. -What was that? -Easy, easy. -Get up. -I'll kick your ass. You make sure you tell the warden that I started this, you hear me? You hear me? You tell-- What the fuck are you--? I'll kick your ass too. Good morning, gentlemen. Welcome to Creighton. My name is Mr. Wallace, and I'm the warden of this prison. I wanted to personally greet you by saying: I run a tight ship. My prison, my rules. Best advice I can give to you is keep to yourself... ...do your time and don't break my rules. No matter how tough you think you are-- And I know some of you think you're real tough. --I will break you. That's a promise. Understood? I got your back. I'm with you. Step forward. Listen up, punk. I know you like to cause problems. That's why you got sent here. I'm gonna personally see to it that that doesn't happen anymore. My officers will resort to any and all measures necessary... ...to keep you in line. Understand? Whatever you say, man. I'm not-- You'll keep your nose clean... ...and stay out of other people's affairs, won't you? Hey, man, look. You know, I only concentrate on my own-- I'm not sure I really heard you correctly. I just want to do my time and leave. That's what I thought you said. I'll remember you. Pick up your prison blues and your shoes. Show them to their cellblocks. -Here you go. -Next. -Here you go. -Next. Here you go. Where you got your soap, kid? Shake my hand. Come on. Shake my hand. This shit they call food-- Keep your eyes on the room. -Copy that. -Anything could be a diversion. Only take one second for these bastards to start killing each other. Sometimes I wonder why we bother standing in the way. How long I gotta wait in line to get food? What's up with that? Baboso wants more money for bringing in the piece. Mira, you know how much that mule was paid? Let me just cut him a piece. What if this motherfucker's double-dealing... ...with the Disciples, homes? -Let me do this. -Are you sure? You shouldn't be sitting here, brother. Is that right? Just trying to give you some friendly advice. Come with me or take your chances with them. -So I should come with you, huh? -Yeah. -And not with them? -Unless you got a loco death wish. And what if I just wanna kick it here, keep to myself? Then I'd imagine you'd get two shanks in you. One from each side. I don't see no shanks in him. Burke? Don't go near him. -Why? -Because he don't want you to. How you know? Burke don't give a fuck about anybody in here but himseIf. And that's cool for him. He can fight his own fights. But you.... ...you wouldn't last a heartbeat. Come on, I think you gonna need some friends. Man, you see these? I don't need shit. Put that little motherfucker away. Let's go see Angel. Good to meet you. Name's Angel. My name's Twitch. What's up? Right on. Shit. I'm from L.A. You know, it's a small little city. You ever heard of it? I got people in L.A. I don't. You a long way from the ocean. This ain't Malibu. Every cell is the same to me, man. Shit, you know-- Ain't the cells you got to worry about. -You know who I am? -Not really, am I su-- Wallace tell you nothing about me when you got here? Wallace? That's the warden, right? Yeah, he like to think so... ...running around here giving orders with his hard ass. But in reality... ...I'm the nigga in charge. I got what you call arrangements. So you have any problems... ...or need any favors... ...you come see me. And all I ask in return... -...is your loyalty. -Sounds good to me, you know. -I only-- -You got to wear the mark. Mark? Angel of Death. That's what binds us. Damn. Y'all ain't got no other type of membership? You know, like cards or some shit? Are you in, brother? Man, I only been here for a day. Y'all don't even know me. How you know I wanna roll with y'all? Is that a threat?I -Look, man, I'm just saying, man-- -Either you with us... ...or you with Cortez. -I ain't with nobody. -Listen, brother. There's a war coming on. You wear this mark, I guarantee you won't be a casualty. Come on. Move it. I say we get the brothers together, man, and make this happen. -Get up in the line now. -Get out of my way. It's just a matter of time before shit hits the fan with Cortez and his gang. Be cool, baby, we'll get him. These motherfuckers. What are we waiting on? -We will. We will. -Come on, when? When the fuck I say so. You think you could run this shit better than me, huh? Look. What I'm saying is... ...Cortez is bringing in more guards and more money... ...while you sit around waiting on God to give you... -...a motherfucking message. -Let me ask you-- What the fuck was that? You were in my way. You know something, Burke? It's about time you fucking learn how things operate around here. And you're gonna show me? Yeah. Go ahead. I'll let you take the first swing. Fuck up some of that good behavior you got going. -Another time, Angel. -Don't you walk away from me, Burke. Don't you fucking walk away from me, Burke! One day. You be ready, Burke. One day. Dirt nap. Come on. We have a deal, right? Right? We got the deal. Okay. So you Burke, huh? Ain't that your name? You know, I heard that you don't deal with none of the gangs and.... You don't fool with none of that, huh? Angel's scared of you. Cortez is afraid of you. They afraid of me too, you know. You know, I don't play too much, man. You a loner, huh? I'm a loner too, you know what I'm saying. Ain't too much I do, you know. I don't really, you know, get involved-- Shut up and keep it that way. -I'm only trying to make it a little easier. -Don't. So what you in for anyway, man? What, you killed somebody? What, you robbed a bank or something? I was thinking about doing something like that myself, man. -You could tell me. l'm your boy, man. -Shut up, will you? Damn. Whatever. Shit. You know, if you don't wanna talk all you gotta do is just say it. I'm just trying to communicate with you, you know. I don't wanna talk. That's cool. Here, sit at number three. You're not gonna see Dad? Honey, I have nothing to say to your dad. Fine. It's your time. Gotta go see my woman, man. Gonna go do it big. I'm gonna talk to you later, huh? Good conversation. Don't you listen in on my conversation. Be cool. Rise, Rise, Rise. You just had to go and get your little butt sent to Missouri. -That's a good thing, ain't it? -A good thing? It's harder knowing that you're so close and I still can't see you. I know, I know, babe, but look-- And then it's two more weeks before I can see your sorry ass again. -I just can't do it, Bernard. -What's with all this ''Bernard'' shit? I told you, don't you call me Bernard here. My name's Twitch. Twitch. Don't you forget that, woman. Don't you ''woman'' me, Bernard. I put up with enough from you, okay? I looked the other way when you had that fat-ass girlfriend. What was you doing with her anyway? All she was gonna do was give you some fat-ass children. That wasn't fat, that was muscle. Look, I know, baby, a lot of times it seems like I take you for granted-- Oh, you take me for granted all the time. I ain't that bad. I got you the ring, didn't I? This shit probably ain't even real. I don't know when you plan on having the wedding... ...but I am calling it off. Yes, I'm calling it off, okay? Your momma gonna be so upset. Wait, wait, hold on, hold on, baby. Hold on, now. I know I make a lot of promises. Yeah. You make a lot of promises, like you gonna marry me... ...like you love me, like you gonna get parole. -But-- -You never deliver on the promises. Ever. How am I supposed to trust you? First of all, I am getting parole, Cherise. -When? -Soon. Hello, Amy. Hey, Ellie. You look great. You changed your hair, didn't you? -I like it. -Thanks. -How's school, baby? -It's summer. Oh, sorry. -No, this is it, Bernard. I'm leaving. -Wait, wait, hold on. All right, now. I gotta tell you something. I am getting out, okay? -I just-- -Forget you, Bernard. Just listen to me, okay? Damn. What I'm talking about has to do with our future. Okay. All right. You know, this better be real good. It is good. Now, I got a plan. -A plan? -Yeah, a plan. It's gonna get us rich. What the hell are you thinking? You gonna get rich in here? You sound like some kind of fool. Who are you talking to? Now, just listen to me. Me getting transferred here was a part of the plan. -What you mean? -I mean... ...I got transferred here on purpose. Now I know you's a fool. Man, listen. I got about a month to get up out this joint, okay? -You mean, escape? -Just keep it down! I am not having no fugitive husband. And I for sure ain't having no fugitive baby daddy. Now, what I'm about to do is gonna set us up for life. -Really? Man, are you serious? -Trust me. And then I'll get you anything you want. All I want is for you to come home. Well, listen to me, baby. I could set up a little ''home sweet home'' right here. Set up one of those little conjugal visiting rooms, you know what I mean. -Slide you something special. -Really? You could make that happen? You know I can. They don't call me ''The Alaskan Pipeline'' for nothing. Oh, I mean, really, for real we can really get a room, baby? Yeah. Twitch will take care of it. But I heard you have to arrange those visits, like, weeks in advance, Bernard. And plus I think you gotta be married. Didn't I say Twitch will take care of it? -Really? -Now give it to me, give it here. Oh, chubblies. -Don't look at me. -Let's go, time's up. Shit. One month. Mind your business. I'm gonna be leaving. -What do you mean? -Me and Mom are moving to Dallas. Dallas? So I don't know when I'll be able to visit you again. This is your mother's idea, isn't it? Please don't be mad at her, okay? I'm gonna start college next year... ...so I probably won't have the chance to visit you. You know, I'd like to spend more time with you, but you're stuck in here, Dad. And I know it wasn't your fault, but it happened. Look at me, Ellie. Just tell me you know how much I love you, baby. What you gonna do with that? Angel about to bless you. But I ain't sneezed. -Man up, little nigga. -Oh, hell, no. Get off me, man. Wait, hold on. Wait. Wait. Fuck! Damn it. Get off me. God. Cherise is waiting for me. Honeymoon suite be ready in about 1 0 minutes. My sugar pot's ready for some honey loving. Me too, baby. He won't be able to walk after I'm done with him. Nope. He won't be able to walk, my baby. You wink at me, bitch? What's up, big papa? All right. Let's go. Come on, Burke. You're on cafeteria duty. Open them up. Is Cherise down there, man? -What's going on, Lewis? -Detector's not functioning. Are you for real? Come on, man, I ain't got no metal on, I ain't got no handcuffs. -Come on. Cherise is down there. -You wanna be strip-searched instead? Yeah. I'm gonna get naked, all right... ...in there, not out here. Yo, what you looking at? Angel! Burke! JT, snatch the gun, man. Damn, Angel. Don't touch him. -I was just closing his eyes. -Don't fucking touch him. I want ten grand on Burke's head. He's fucking dead. Back off! Back off. But it ain't working, man. Cherise! Let me go. You'll never have to bother with that man again. Stop it, Mom. He's my dad. What kind of father has he been to you? Wallace, there's a riot. We need a lockdown. Cellblock C in the cafeteria. There's a riot in the cafeteria. Put it in lockdown. -I'm on it. -Right away, sir. Come on, we're leaving. All cells in lockdown. I repeat. Prisoners, back to your cells. -Did you hear that? -Put it back. Put it down. I didn't do nothing, man. The lockdown is down there. -Could you open this? -I can't open the gate. -The whole prison's on lockdown. -Lockdown? You're not gonna be able to stay. You gotta go. -Oh, my God. -You gotta go now. Oh, my God. Ellie, run! Oh, God. Run, Ellie, run! Y'all not the police. You're the no-lease. I'll kick your ass. Take these off. -Down. -Down. What's going on, man? Burke killed Angel. Fuck, are you for real? What you gonna do, you gonna kill me? Give me one reason why I shouldn't. You get a free pass this time. But don't ever let me see you again, huh? Fuck. -Did you see who it was? -No, I didn't get a look. Manual override. Perimeter gates are all shut. C block's still open. How the hell--? Can we override? I'm trying, but it's not working. Get a team down there. Response team to C-block right away. I repeat, response team to C-block. Now D-block's open. Who's doing this? Should I send in ERT, sir? -Affirmative. -Yes, sir. Easiest ten grand I ever made. There's a price on your head and I'm collecting. Burke, you popped Angel, this is what you get. Come here. Get back here. Get him back here now. Burke. Come here. You move and I'll snap you. I ain't going nowhere, but I don't think that's gonna stop him from shooting. Yeah, like he's gonna shoot a brother. Back off or I'll break his neck. -Hey, do as he say-- -Shut up. -This motherfucker killed Angel. -I'm gonna count to three. -One. -Drop-- Drop the heat, JT. -JT, he's one of us, man. -No, he isn't. Three. There's nowhere to hide. I own this motherfucker. Gotta hold on. Move. I'm talking to you. I'm talking to you. Stop where you are! Stop where you are! Well, it's about time, Bernard. You in the wrong room. You probably down the hall. Girl, what's wrong with you? You okay? You don't know what's going on? This whole place is in lockdown. There's a riot going on. -Oh, my God. Are you serious? -Yes. Okay. We can't stay in here. The door doesn't lock. Halt, you men, I will shoot if you don't! I will shoot you. -You ain't gonna kill me, is you, man? -If you don't shut the fuck up, I will. You don't look like a killer. But you'd best snap my neck. And you don't want 10 added to the 10 you already getting for killing Angel. l didn't kill Angel. Get out of here. Go on! -Coming this way. -Crazy. -Shit. -Coming this way. -Told y'all. -Move back, back! Shit. -Move. Move. Go. -Stay where you are! Oh, shit. Guards are coming! Hey, get him. He's one of Angel's gang. Rivera. Oh, come on, man. I ain't got no problem with y'all. -You're one of Angel's disciples, huh? -Who? I don't even know the guy. What's his name again? Oh, come on, man. Swear to God. Look, man, I'm just trying to ease on through-- What--? That's pretty, man. Well, I guess God don't believe you today. Back off. Get off. Hey, what's up, big papa? You need to stay out of this, because it's got nothing to do with you. Oh, it doesn't? Where's Cortez? Cortez got less to do with your ass. -Is he trying to escape? -Escape? -Twitch, get the fuck out of here. -Man, what you want with me for? Wanna stay here and play around with these guys? Now, go. Lucky he came. I'll kick your ass. Don't fuck with me. That was a good job, you know. Clipping Angel's wings. Saved me the fucking trouble. Hey, aren't you gonna go, no? I set him up, bro. I'm gonna let the guards do it for us. Go over there and spread out. Let's go, let's go! Check that gate. They're all locked. What do we have here? -Please. Please. -So beautiful. You're so tender. Hey, big dog, Rivera sent me to find you. Where'd you get these fine little honeys at? -Back off, homes. -Hey, there's two of them. You got that one, I got this one-- I told you to back off, mano. Yeah, I got it. I got it. Bitch. All right, se. We'll see what's up later, right? See you. I have plans for both of you. Move! I could have handled that all by myself back there. Yeah, right. As long as JT and everybody else thinks I killed Angel, I'm a marked man. This way, they gotta shoot their own brother to get to me. Man, these guys ain't my brothers. I told you before, Burke, I'm a loner. I don't care about no one. Just like you, man. -Come on. -I got somebody I care about. You ladies picked the wrong day to visit. You leave this room and you're dead. Oh, God, he locked us in. We're gonna have to stay calm. We're gonna have to try and stay calm. Goddamn it. We lost power, warden. But we're switching to emergency generators right now. What are you doing? What are you doing? Trying to figure a way out of here. I saw on TV that the safest thing to do at a time like this is to sit and wait. Are you crazy? That is not the safest thing. Any minute that guy could be back and shoot either one of us. If we do get out, it might get us both killed. Well, you know what? You take your chances here, I'll take mine out there. Let's say you do get out. What-- What-- What then? There's a riot on the other side. Do you really think you're gonna get out through that? -You have no idea-- -Shut up. What? Real smart. I don't think just because you're big and tall... ...that you can open that without a key. You are just begging for me to kick your ass, aren't you? Worse than the police, man. Get off me, man. You make me nervous. -You got a bull's-eye on your back. -I didn't kill Angel. -Well, who did, then? -Cortez. Angel! -Cortez? -Yeah. Oh, I get it. The riots, the distraction. Then you'll hook up with him later, and y'all gonna fly off in the sunset. But not without me. I got value. You take me with you. -You'll just slow me down. -Slow you down? You the big meathead, motherfucker. -Burke! -You-- -Get in the cell-- -Relax. I don't wanna hurt you. -Get in the cell-- -Relax. Oh, fuck. Come on. Get them all locked in there. Burke, Burke, Burke. -There's other juras I can hurt. -That's right. Let's go! -Come on! -Okay, okay, come on. Bitch. Beat your ass. You know, my fianc Bernard could get this thing open in a second. He was a master thief. Real stupid, too. Got himself caught up. I've been waiting for that man for years. What about you? Who were you here to see? My dad. How long has he been in? Two years and four more to go. Let me try. Oh, goodness, I hope Bernard didn't go get himself in no more trouble. -Would you look at that? -They're dead. -All units--! -Hey, come on. --cell block C. Get the walkie, man. It might-- Goddamn it! -Two guards are dead. -Jesus. Surveillance confirms both were last seen... ...with the transfer from New Alcatraz when the riot started. All officers fall back behind the perimeter. Fall back behind the perimeter. Meet at security checkpoints. You're clearing all cellblocks? I'm pulling my men out until they've all got body armor... ...and something to fight back with. All officers, pull back. Convene in the armory for body armor and riot gear for ERT response. Yes? -Sir. -What? There's an inmate on line 101. -What? -It's Alex Cortez. Put him through. Alex? Where are you? What phone are you on? You don't get to ask questions. You get to take orders. Or else more body bags are coming out the front gate. If I find out you're responsible for anyone's death-- Shut up, fool. I'm doing life without parole. Don't threaten me again. -What phone is he on? -It's impossible to tell. Here's what you're gonna do. Call the governor. Tell him to get in his helicopter... ...and fly his fat ass out here immediately. I don't think I have the authority to make that happen. If you can't, the hostages die. You have hostages? Yeah. Two beautiful young ladies. Not the kind of people you people don't give a damn about. Make it happen, Wallace. Don't forget the helicopter. Check the visitor records. Find out if anyone is unaccounted for. -Get me the governor. -Yes, sir, right away. Call the warden. Get us the fuck out of here. We're in lockdown, governor. The two cellblocks have been manually overridden. -How is that possible? -We're not exactly sure, sir. It seems some inmates have gained access to one of the control panels. What's their motive? It's gang-related. They're at war, sir. Total chaos. Can you contain it? We're trying, sir. Emergency Response Teams have been deployed. But there have been some officer fatalities. Damn it, Wallace. I mean, it's the last thing we need in an election year. -How many officers? -Three that we know of for sure. All right. Look, you need to end this thing quickly, no matter what it takes. All right? But protect our people at all cost. Has the press been notified? No, sir. We've been able to keep a lid on that. All right. My office will handle all the press from this end. Just a minute. Charlie. Hey, call the airport... ...make sure the helicopter's ready, wheels up in 20 minutes. We're going to Creighton. I'm on my way. Yes, sir. -Here we go. -Tell me why you got transferred here. -Tell me. -What, you don't know? -Bullshit about a fight. -It was more than a fight. It's three of them and they thought because I'm little... ...I couldn't whoop that ass, but I got this thing I did: -You can't fight worth a shit. -Shut up. Kick your ass. -What? -If my ankle didn't hurt. Hey, quit lying to me. Why'd you get transferred here? I-- I wanted to be closer to my fiance, Cherise. -You're lying. -No, I'm not. Your eyes are moving... -...and you're lying. -My eyes always move. Yeah, that's my point exactly. Why'd you get transferred here? Look, I can't swim. Creighton has no water or sharks. You're telling me you got transferred here just so you could escape? Goddamn right. I'm a crazy motherfucker. No shit. There's the motherfucker that killed Angel. Hey, hey, hey. Wait, wait, wait! -Come on. -Bitch! Any luck? It's not working. Just keep trying. Been trying. Look, we need another way. God knows when that guy is gonna come back. This is creepy. It's where people watch the executions. Yeah. -I could never do it. -Do what? Just sit there and watch people die. We gotta get this door open. It's our only way out. You tried to get out? After what we just said to you? Tie her up. What the hell is wrong with you? I said, tie her up. It's too much like Alcatraz. Eric, make sure each officer gets one. Robert, back to the office and monitor everything from there. All right, everybody. Time to move. All officers, this is the warden speaking. Take back control one cellblock at a time. There's some inmates to be on the lookout for. One William Burke. One Bernard ''Twitch'' Washington. Both suspects in the murder of two guards. Did he just say my name? Twitch is the transfer from New Alcatraz. Both he and Burke are likely armed. No, no, we ain't, man. Tell him we're not. Try to take them alive. -Shoot to kill if you have to. -Give me that. -Man, you ain't talking to him. -Look, I've gotta clear my name, Burke. We've got another situation we gotta handle. Another inmate, Alex Cortez, has taken hostages inside. We don't know exactly how many... ...but we believe there are two missing visitors. -One Cherise-- -Hey, man, give me this thing. Wallace. -You there? -Who's this? This is Twitch, man. Just what the hell do you think you're doing? Hey, man, why you got this APB out on me, man? I ain't kill nobody. No one's accused you of anything. Yeah, you did. You got the APB cracking on us, man. Rioters everywhere, man. That's not due process. Okay, then turn yourself in and let's clear this up. -What? What is it? -We're not meeting him. -Twitch, are you there? -Yeah, man. Well, what do you say? About going over this face to face? I know how that one works. We get there and all your guard dogs are there. You can forget that one, buddy. My men won't harm you, I promise. Man, you gonna call the APB off or what, Wallace? Just tell me where you are and we'll work this-- You're not gonna meet with him. Man, this is bullshit. This prison's full of shit. Twitch? Twitch. Goddamn it, let's go. Open it. The second hostage is Ellie Burke, daughter of inmate William Burke. Keep your eyes right. Move it out. Keep your eyes right. Move it. Hey, perro. Look at this. Handle it. Hurry up, men. Hurry up. Where's Burke? I don't know. -Are you sure? -I don't give a damn about Burke. -You, motherfu-- -Wow, easy, easy. Easy. Is that right? Where's your jefe? I don't give a damn about him, either. You see, because he fucked me over with his escape plan, man. -Escape plan? -That's right. He took hostages. And, you know, one of them is Burke's daughter. That's right. Yeah. And he's going to use them to get out of here. Bet you didn't know that, huh? Hey, perro, that's the police with riot gear. -Stop! -This don't look good, man. Show these motherfuckers who run this place! Tear gas. Get out of here. Keep going, man. What? -Let's move it, dog. Let's move. -Fuck you. I don't like the way this shit sounds. It don't sound like they're handling this too good, man. Cortez ain't gonna surrender, man. -We gotta get to him first. -Look, I've been here before. Nobody wins. What are you talking about? The Rock. New Alcatraz. Man, I did five years, man. One night, man, it was just raining like fuck, man. Fucking helicopter crashed into the roof, man. No! People started coming out, man, shooting people with all kinds of guns. lnmates died, guards died, you know. A lot of shit was going on, man. Come on, I lost a lot of people in there, man. People that I cared about. No! No! No! God. Why the hell would guys break into prison? Man, none of that matters to me. Just listen to me. A lot of shit happened, okay? -I ain't trying to go through shit again. -Look, man, this time's different. Follow me. How we gonna--? Damn.... Look, I could teach you some shit. Man, I should just-- -Hey, no. -Big bad Burke. Yeah, you couldn't do it like a man. You had to do it like a little bitch. -It's not what you think. -You know what I'm thinking? Yeah, I didn't kill Angel. Oh, so you still can't admit that shit? I'd respect you more if you could admit that shit. So we gonna do this like men. Old-school style. Do what you gotta do. Now, see, that was just the appetizer. Now it's time for the main course. We're gonna cut your ass up, make you into some Chinese food... ...and serve you to the skinheads. Look at me. Yeah. Old-school style. Take this motherfucker to the cafeteria. Yeah. Get that fryer going. Get it going. Yeah, yeah. This will do. This is what we're gonna do. What it look like? Looks like you gonna cook something. Cortez killed Angel, not me. -Oh, fuck, man. -Let him go. -Easy, easy, cool. Let him go. -I'll whoop your ass. Easy. Come on, JT, listen to me. Listen to me. I ain't gonna say nothing to nobody, you already know that. What about the rest of these motherfuckers, shit? Is everybody else gonna be quiet about the whole thing? -What the hell is you saying, Twitch? -I'm just saying... ...we gonna kill this motherfucker, right? I mean, what, is everybody else gonna be quiet about the whole thing? -Damn right. -And take it to their grave? I mean, fuck it, cook him. If anybody gonna speak a word about this, it's you. Snitch. Now get the fuck out the way. Fellas, we gonna have ''sum dumb fuck'' on the menu. -Shit. Quit pushing. -It's too bad, Burke. You won't get a chance to save your daughter. Oh, you didn't know, did you? This motherfucker didn't know Cortez had his daughter as hostage. It's a first-class ticket out of motherfucking paradise. Yeah, and after Cortez, I got next, motherfucker. Come here, come on, Burke. Burke, Burke, Burke, come on. We gotta go. We gotta go. -I don't like the sound of this. -I'm going after Cortez. -You going after him? -He's got my daughter. You wanna escape? Go ahead. You tripping. Hey, Burke. Hold on, man. Wallace, is the governor on his way? What do you want with him? This is the governor. I'm on my way. ETA 30 minutes. I want the whole prison locked down by the time I get there. Now, we've got another situation we've gotta handle. Two guards are confirmed dead. We have suspects. Our men are tracking them now. I want those guys caught. Dead or alive. Doesn't matter to me. Make sure you keep the situation under control. I'll be there as soon as I can. Wait, wait. Hold on, Burke. -Hold on. Damn. -Shit. -Come on, give me a hand. -Wait, wait, wait. Let me try this. Pull. -Just.... -Over here, hermano. Come on. -Come on. -I can't. -Wait. I got an idea, I got an idea. -What? Well, you know... ...I used to steal cars. I could hot-wire this bitch. Man, hurry up, will you? So tell me your charge. -I'll tell you mine. -I don't really care. Breaking and entering, huh? -What, you hit the White House? -Man, hurry up! I'm not doing shit. What you in here for? -I'm in here for nothing. -Man, that's what they all say, man. Okay, a friend of mine knocked off an armored car. I should have known about it, but I didn't. Cops found him at my house with a bag full of cash. -Bag full of cash? -Yeah. He implicated me, knocked a couple of years off his sentence. I got five years. I lost my wife. She took my little girl away from me. She's the only thing I ever loved. Everybody else.... Everybody else has shit on me. I got burnt before too, Burke. I'd never burn you, homey. Yeah, we'll see. -Get that motherfucker. Come on. -Oh, shit. Come on, Burke. Fuck you, Burke. You're a dead man. -Yo, dog, this way. -All right, all right. Ready? -Let's go, let's go. -Let's go. Move it out. Total lockdown. Let's put this all back together, now. Get ready for anything. Half the cellblocks are under control. It's a matter of time for the rest. Still no Cortez. This is a prison. How many places can he hide? How does he think he's gonna get out? -Glad you could make it, sir. -What's the status? Afraid things have gotten worse. Inmate Alex Cortez has captured two civilian hostages. -Both females. -Christ. Wallace, how could this happen? Governor, the riot began just after visitation... ...and one of the hostages was in the conjugal room. All right, let's get in there. I wanna talk to this Cortez. Burke locked us up. He's a dead man. Hey, you do this thing, you're gonna get out of here. Soon. Got it? This place is falling apart, man. -Oh, shit. -Burke, I've been looking for you. Check it out, man. Where's Cortez? You just follow me. I know where that motherfucker Cortez is, bro. -Come on. -I don't like this. This runs below the cellblock. -It ends at the machine shop. -That's where Cortez is? That's right, the motherfucker. He knew about this shit all along. Just around here. Shit. -Where are you leading us, man? -I told you, Cortez. Relax, man. Why are you telling us this? I was supposed to break out with this motherfucking bitch. He betrayed me. And I want some motherfucking payback. l could use your help. Listen, I don't give a shit about payback. I just wanna find my daughter. Man, I don't like this. I don't like this. How come nobody else know about this? A cop will sell any information for a price. Hey! Rivera! Fuck. What the fuck? I knew we couldn't trust this fucking guy. You know what? You tell the warden when this is all over, he'll pay. When I get my hands on Cortez, I'm gonna snap his fucking neck. Gotta be another way. Oh, shit. I didn't do nothing. -Let's go, come on. -Twitch. Better come. Look, I want some answers and I want them now. And this time, I want the truth. -About what? -Why your ass got transferred here. I already told you why. All right, fuck it, man. I ain't gonna find it anyway. -Find what? -The gold. Let me get this straight. You got transferred here so you could break out and find some gold? -$ 160 million worth. -Bullshit. All right. I know you never heard of Lester McKenna. United States Supreme Court Justice Jane McPherson... ...just landed at New Alcatraz. She's here to witness the execution of Lester McKenna. He was my cellie at the Rock, okay? He done hit the government for a shitload of cash, you understand? Gold bricks. McPherson is the judge who sentenced McKenna... ...in the now infamous heist of almost $200 million in U.S. gold brick. They found one piece of it, but he stashed another piece, okay? And only two people know about it, me and Hubert... ...who's also on the Rock. I'm out in a month. Mark your calendar. Feds have been coming around all week... ...promising me serenity if I tell them where I hid it. In a bizarre twist, McKenna was able to stash the gold... ...before he was apprehended. And he vowed never to divulge its whereabouts. This is what led to the nationwide treasure hunt by the FBI... ...that's gone on for 17 years. Now it's looking like McKenna just might take his secret to the grave. Reporting live from Pier 39 on Fisherman's Wharf... ...I'm Roxanne Long from San Francisco. That crazy motherfucker made sure nobody else could find it. -Where is it? -I ain't gonna tell you. I didn't say I wanted your gold. Oh, fuck off, Burke. You're not so noble to where... ...you don't wanna get no money. Shit, I been without it so long that if I had it, I'd appreciate it. Look, neither one of us are on death row. So we'll get our asses out of here and we'll find it. Wait, wait, wait. I got an idea, man. You know what? I think I know where Cortez is. Cortez is on line one. Hey, Wallace. Is the governor there? -I'm here. -Glad you could make it. -Let me speak to the hostages. -I don't think so. How do I know you haven't harmed any of them? Trust me, governor. Did you bring the helicopter? Yeah. Listen, about that. We're trying to bring one in now. Bullshit. I'm taking the one you brought. Have it in the rec yard in 10 minutes. And no games. By now I think you know what I'm capable of. What's the ETA on the hostage negotiator? Forget that. Cortez is done negotiating. Give him the helicopter. For now. Wait a minute. That's a murderer you're setting loose. If you got a better idea, I'd certainly like to hear it. Let's at least keep the lines of communication with him open. Time is running out and I want those hostages out of there. We don't even know where Cortez is holding them. Try looking at your monitors. Who are those guys? That's inmate Burke and that New Alcatraz transfer. The girl is Burke's daughter. And the woman is the other inmate's fianc. -Looks like they're trying to find them. -Those two? -They're heading towards the annex. -Annex? I need ten officers to come with me right away. And bring armor. What's the annex? Death row. -Sometimes you gotta use your brain. -Okay. Yes, we are in the game. Move. Okay. Let's do this. -Bernard. -Dad. -Ellie. -Keep cool. What the fuck is going on? That's your daughter? And this is your bitch? Oh, come on, Cortez. Man, don't do that. -Let them go, Cortez. -Who the fuck do you think you are? Get out of the doorway. These two are my ticket out of here. There's another way out. Take it before it's too late. You better back off. Then shoot me. Dad. It's all right, Ellie. You step one more foot, I'm gonna blow her face off. Look. If you want a hostage, you take me. -What, are you kidding? -I got value, man. You got nothing. You got a hot bitch and she's mine now. I know where 160 million is stashed. Now you let the ladies go... -...and I'll cut you in. -Don't play me. I'm not trying to play you. I'll tell you where it is, I'll draw you a map. Come on, man. You're an inmate. I don't believe a goddamn thing you're saying. And as a hostage you're useless. I tell you what. When I get out of here, I'll think about setting them free. Now, both of you, get the fuck out of my way. -I can't let you do that, Cortez. -Oh, you can and you will. Dad! Dad! Why, you motherfucker-- Move! Go, go, go. Move. -Cortez! -Dad! Dad! Shut up! Dad! Sorry about your dad. You ain't going nowhere, fool. -Fucker, get out of my way. -Get your ass in there. -Fuck. -Get your ass in-- What? Wanna throw people through windows? -Get your ass that way. Go. -Fuck. I should pop you right now. No, I should whoop your ass first, then pop it. Bernard. Dad, stop. You're gonna kill him. Dad. -Are you okay, baby? -Yeah. -Let's go, let's go. -Come on. -You all right, man? -I'm alive, dude. Eric, you guys get Cortez inside right now. Everything okay? I ought to throw you two guys in solitary, pulling a stunt like that. Burke, Twitch, let's go. -Let's go inside. -Dad. It's gonna be all right, baby. -I love you. -I love you. I'm getting out soon, now, you hear? -You wait for me, now. -I always do. Let's go. Let's go. And every word of it's true. I swear. Just ask the warden. I can verify that Bernard Washington did in fact try to defuse the riot... ...and is one of two men responsible for the rescue of the hostages. The other one was Burke. He helped with the saving thing too. I remind you again that this is your parole hearing, not Mr. Burke's. I know. I just wanted to put that on record. For when it's his turn to spin that parole wheel. You sure about what you saw? Well, we've heard the account of your supposed bravery... ...from Warden Wallace. And we've taken into consideration... ...the years you've served in New Alcatraz. Except for a few minor infractions. And we hereby grant you your parole. Are you serious? Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, thank you. -Congratulations, Twitch. -Thank you. -Good luck, man. -Yeah. Now keep that nose clean. Ain't got to worry about me. Bernard. Bernard! Okay. I mean, come on. Really, I ain't got no time for games. What's up? -Where is it? -Just-- I see that big old box, where is the gold? -I don't see it. -Shut up and just help me. Help you? You big enough to help yourself. Just grab it. Ready? Here we go. -Oh, my God. -Shit. -Baby. Is it--? -Shit. It's gold. It's really here, baby. You did it. Baby. I can't believe it. You did it. Twitch. Twitch. -We rich, baby. -We rich. We rich. -What? -We better get this out of here quick. -Look at this. -Let me count my money. -Oh, it's your money, Bernard? -Yeah, it's my money. That's what I'm talking about. Just bring the money to the car. Hurry up. -You wouldn't help me dig, wouldn't-- -I ain't helping nothing. When you was in the jail, you was crying like girl. I risked my life for you and you wouldn't help. Help me get this out of here. Get your ass back here. -Dude, you look tight. -Thanks, this is my Snoop Dogg look. I'm gonna tell you something. You put this in your pocket, right? Don't give it to your ma or pa and don't buy no drugs. You'll be all right. Go on, now. You enjoy yourself, boy. -Hey. -Hey, Twitch. Hey, Cherise. Hey, Burke. What's up? Same old, man. How about you? You don't notice nothing different about your boy? You know, come to think of it... ...you are a hell of a lot uglier. -Not funny. What you laughing at? -Very funny. If 80 million will make you this ugly, you need a facelift. -Only 80? -Well, actually it was more. We put the other 80 into a separate account. -For you. -Eighty million? -Well, shit. It wasn't my idea. -Yes, it was. Stop lying. Eighty million dollars? You gotta keep that on the low, they might think I stole it. Keep it on the low. -I don't know what to say, guys. -We owed you, Burke. You make sure you push some of that up, now. You got that beautiful little daughter of yours. Now, college is a killer. Don't you worry, guys. I will. -You gonna be okay in here? -I'm gonna be just fine, darling. He transferred Cortez. See, that's what that boy get. Something was wrong with him. He had a real serious problem, you know? But check this out, I had an idea. How would you like it if I got your daughter... ...and brought her to you for Christmas? -Bernard. -You guys don't have to do that, now. Oh, that's not far at all. Missouri is a hop, skip and a jump away... ...when you're in first class. Now, you know we supposed to go see Mama for Christmas. Like I said, it sounds like a great idea to come here for Christmas. Oh, don't you disrespect my mama like that. I said we gonna take his daughter here to see him, that's what we're gonna do. No, we not. Not on no Christmas, we ain't. I don't know who you think you are. Stop calling-- How many times I gotta tell you to stop calling me ''woman''? -You all high and mighty. -What's your problem? You ain't got no bling like me. You been trouble. -You should've never called me. -I should've never called. Ever since you put on this little hat-- -Anyway, Burke. -We're going-- You don't talk to me like that. Man, I don't wanna talk to you. You ain't got no say in this. -I know-- -Whatever. Whatever.
