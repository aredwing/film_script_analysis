The day my mom died, l made a resolution... ...to escape this middle class rut and get my doctorate in the U.S. As if on cue, Uncle Jagannathan arranged our alliance. Conveniently, he was in the U.S., so... l see. That's why you agreed to marry Mr. Vishwanath, despite the age difference. Of course it was a marriage of convenience. l don't know what Wiz expected, but he knew what he was getting into. - Wiz? - Yes, Wiz is my husband. - Oh, is that your pet name for him? - No way! Everyone called him that, so l did too. We've never been a loving couple. l told him from the start that l came here to study. To hit the books, not the sack. He smiled and agreed. He has a great sense of humour though. So, what is your Ph.D. on? Nuclear oncology. l had several job offers lined up... But l chose Deep nuclear research and oncology. The pay was good. No complaints at all, till... Till Deepak? Who is Deepak? Does he work at your company? No, no. l work at his company. He's my boss and is very rich. That's not why l started this... Affair! l'm not a bad person, doctor. None of my patients are. And you're not even my patient. l agreed to see you for Bindu's sake. She said you were her rock during her divorce. She recommended Peter Manivannan. Detective Peter Manivannan here. Quickly, tell me. He just stepped out of class. Right now following your husband madam. Okay! Just find out if there's another woman in his life. Most likely it won't be a woman. Let me know either way, immediately. lf he hasn't, l'll feel very guilty. So guilt seems to be the key here. Alright... When do you feel guiltier? Before or after sex? - What sex? - With your secret lover. How crude! Nothing like that has happened...yet. Yet? So it's imminent? lmminent? Look doctor, even if l do it, what's wrong with that? lt's nothing new in America. Didn't Bindu tell you about my husband? He's your husband. You tell me. When did you and Vishwanath stop living as a normal couple? He's not normal. So...! How is he? You are the unique king of Aninaya. Child of Gokula. You emit crores of light. ln this land of sorrow you have come as the savior. How many times will l yearn and die? What should l do for you to accept me? Vaakala who has accepted the worn garland. The girl was tired of yearning for him. He sent her to lndarlok as an angel. Will you accept the infatuation of the lady? Aayardham Maaya you come. Aaya Maaya. Aayardham Maaya you come. Aaya Maaya. Aayardham Maaya you come. Aaya Maaya, come. Without seeing you, l am not me. No root without a seed. Without seeing you, l am not me. No root without a seed. Krishna! Without seeing you, l am not me. No root without a seed. Sky that seen daily is not true. Dream that gives pleasure is not happiness. l'm not me without you. Without seeing you, without seeing you. Without seeing you, without seeing you. Without seeing you the heart of the lady is in unrest. No root without a seed. Shaamala Ranga with lyrical love. You are the Linga who dances to the beat. She is tired without proper sleep. Radha is the one who is yearning for you daily. Radha is for you only Only one Radha is for you. You have superb hearing, guruji. You are the expert, Brahmin lady Tell me how the chicken tastes. How do you cook meat so well despite being a vegetarian? Don't even ask. You know my wife. She loves chicken. And l love my wife. l'm lucky to have been blessed with such a good wife. The story is over. Off you go now. lf you see like that how l will approach you? l stood in front of mirror and saw myself. To join together, l did rehearsal for... ...Hundred dramas and l looked for you. Without expecting, he...! Without expecting, he...! Oh! He came from my behind hugged like a top... ...and he kissed lip to lip. She forgot that there is a world near her. Like a dress on the body will you wear me? From now on? From now on? Kannaa... My eyes which don't sleep, will sleep because of Kannan. From now on...From now on... Without this happening. Without seeing you. With this my heart beat have ended. Without thinking that useless carving. l'll live by breathing you. Deceit thief, Kanna Kanna. Desired artist Kanna Kanna. Deceit thief, Kanna Kanna Desired artist Kanna Kanna. Hold on a sec. Hello...Mrs. & Mr. Vishwanath residence. Jagannath speaking. Hello, Uncle! How's London? l don't know. - You don't? - l'm at JFK now. JFK? When did you land? Just now. You didn't warn me. Fine, come on over. Dawkins is with me. Bring him too. We'll have dinner here. l can easily cook for four. Okay? Well, then... - Should l leave? - Eat first and then go. l haven't even showered. You smell nice only... You can use our bathroom. Hey! Shut the door. You want your guru to catch pneumonia? Get going, ladies. Two lives are involved here. Actually, three. Dinner for two then... He's probably made dinner already. You eat at home every night. Just for a change... Okay Mrs. Vishwanath, what if your boss asks you to work overtime? The matter is settled. Go to my office, cash in the safe and then dinner, l'll take that as yes... Sounds like Uncle and Dawkins need to brief us about something over dinner. But how? ln front of Nirupama? Nirupama won't be home for dinner. Did you have a premonition? Exactly. Hello, Mrs. & Mr. Vishwanath residence. l know it is Nirupama. l've cooked a fantastic dinner for you. Along with a special surprise. - Ask me what it is. - No. - Why? - Don't bug me. l'm stuck with work. l'm at the office right now. Boss' orders. l'll be very late. Kill joy. l'll tell you the surprise anyway. Uncle is here from London. Oh God. You didn't even bother to tell me beforehand? l just found out. He landed at JFK and called me. Dawkins is with him. - Which Dawkins? - Say hello to him. Hello... Hello, l'm sorry, l can't talk, got mouthful of food...! That's ok no problem, can you give the phone to my husband please. - Of course. - Thank you. Let them eat now. They are starving. Come soon. l'll wait for you. You don't have to wait up for me. - l don't care for leftovers. - l'll make you something. There's no need! Send my apologies to your uncle. - Who is coughing? - Oh, that! Just a lab technician. l hear car horns. You said you were at work. l'm going from the lab to the office with the lab technician... ...the Mexican, it's quite a long walk you know?! You're being a typical husband. Bombarding me with questions and suspicions. That's all l can do over the phone, since l can't see you. Are you mad at me? No, l'm all smiles! You just can't see it over the phone. - Come and show me then. - Enough. Okay, bye bye l got to go. Did you see how suspicious he was? Why wouldn't he be? My looks, his age... l'm also rich... Suspicions and jealousy are only natural. This isn't funny. What will l do? Will put the money in safe. Enter into the computer and then we go. Shall l go outside? No no no open the computer, password is ''Moolah''. - You just told me the password. - Ya...of course babe, partner. Now pass me the money. ls it safe to keep all this money here? Why not in a bank? You don't trust banks? l do. But American banks don't trust some of my customers. What customers? Yemen, most of the middle east countries, Nigeria. What is wrong with them? Can't they stop bragging? They have to raise Obama's ratings. So? Why celebrate someone's death as if it were a party? People usually celebrate a demon's death. Try telling that to the demon's family. Why are we worried for them? What say you john. You should go home Ashmita... before Nirupama comes. Come on l'll drop you. Go. Bye Viz. Jag. Work tomorrow, lets hope it doesn't turn out to be a wet job. We just have to do what we have to do. Or our respect and dignity will suffer. We have a reputation to keep. Do we! What kind? Good night cuckold. Come on let's go. Hello, madam! What's your husband's name? Fantastic! After all this time, now you ask me his name? l thought it was Vishwanath, a Hindu name. lf you know, why ask? l'm confused. l have good reason to ask. Either Vishwanath is a fake name or he has converted. Converted? Convert to what? - Hello, Uncle. - Yes, tell me. Nirupama's fatso is after me. - Where are you? - Me? Near the warehouse. Why did you go there? Why? Because of Farouk. How would l know l'd be followed? What do l do? Run! Just lose him. What are you looking for brother?

Brother Salim. Brother... Brother. Brother? Where is he now?. At the factory! The meat factory. This way. A couple of questions, a couple of strikes. and he dropped dead. We can make it look like suicide. l got his signature just in case. There are many details in his notes. Name, address, client name, Dr. Nirupama, boss Deepak. Deepak of Deep Research? Take care of it right away. Hello, Deep? What a mess! We've opened a can of worms. You know?. Know what? Yes, that's right. Let's talk in person. Come right away. Here? Wiz will be home any minute. What the hell have you gone and done women? - Deep language. - Shut up. Why did you send your detective to Farouk's place? How did you... Whose place? Don't faff around with me woman. This is dangerous. Deep, why are you talking like that? You've changed. l don't mind changing. l mind dying! l'm scared. Why the hell did you send the detective there? l did it for us. l thought it would be good for us if he caught Wiz red handed. - He's Muslim. - Your husband is Muslim? Mr. Deep what a surprise. Did you offer him anything, Niru? Are you Muslim? What? Cut the crap! Trust me, he is Muslim. What else have you been hiding from me? Excuse me. Let's not argue in front of others. Listen to me... lf you touch her l'll break your hand. Hands off! l should be saying that. She's my wife! How dare you come to my house and threaten me? Please get out. Oh, really? Come on. Let's go, Deep. No, this is our house. You stay, he gets out. We'll get out so the police can come. No no no no. No! Did you lead the detective to that place? Why would l lead him? He followed me to the warehouse. Hold it right there. Did l say warehouse? Did l? You mother f... You knew?. Sure, l've known my mother since birth. l'll break your face! Oh, l get it! Don't insult my mother in front of my wife. - Show some respect, or else... - Or else what? Deep, he can't take all that! You'll kill him. One murder is enough. - Murder? - Wow, look at his acting! Why are you acting? This won't work. l'll let them handle it. That's right. Call the police. No not the cops you fool! Fool? Watch your tongue. l'm not your wife yet. Thank God for that. Come in lt's just these two? Who are you people? He's my friend! He's here to ask you some questions. Questions? - Who the hell are you? - Shut up. No questions! Come with me. Why should we? l'm calling 911. Why would you hit a woman like that? Would it hurt if l hit her like this? That's why. What's your name? - Tawfeeq. - Vishwanath. No hurry, Tameez. Take your time. Just keep chewing on the tape until the cops arrive. lt's stuck, boss. Excuse me do you have scissor, knife, blade. Second drawer on the counter. Second drawer. Yes, that drawer. Why do you need scissors? Why are you cutting your dirty tape with our scissors? Would you like it if we cut our dirty tape with your scissors? lt's very unhygienic. Hello. Go. Go, go. Go. Please shut the door. Please. Quickly. Shut it. What's your husband's real name? He just told me. Some Muslim name. Tell him! Oh, Farouk. What? Farouk is my name. Tameez...Tariq!

Do as you please, just let me go. Deep, you creep, you are handing us over to these pigs. He hits me and you just stand there? What kind of a man are you? You need a man? How about this one kneeling beside you? Ask him. He'll rush to your rescue. What can he do with his hands tied? Untie him and see for yourself. No, what are you doing? No need, sir! Keep me tied up. l will... Correct! Spit out the truth. Yuck! Why? There are cleaner ways to say it. But you must believe me. l swear on Allah. - Nasser is my name. - What? Tawfeeq is also a good name. Still, my name is Nasser. Did it hurt? l always get hit there. At this rate, we won't have children. We? Who? Who else? For better or for worse, you are my wife. Okay, okay. Don't cry. Shush. Call Salim. l'll tell him and leave. No, no one moves without orders from Brother Omar. Omar? Who's that? Yes, Farouk. Tell me. Who? Hold on. Brother, it's Farouk.

He shook his head too much. Damn... Hey hold him. Did you get it now?. Got it. Send Salim the picture. Get me some water. Tamil. Not anywhere near the bomb of Hiroshima. Not even 1/10th of it. But strong enough to make New York uninhabitable for the next 30 years. l've told them to dub it into other languages. Behroz. Send it to the antique shops on 5th Avenue. - Yes, sir. - Munnavar. Munnavar will pick it up in the morning. Yes, sir. - Be careful. - Yes, sir. Sir, l just got Nirupama's husband's picture. l checked her files, nothing on him, on your screen.

No, he said to end it. Not the knees! The head. Okay brother! What? - What? Can l go? - You can. But before you go you have to do me a small favor. Hold this. Spread it out. Can't your men do this? They will, but you'll also help, come on. Come stand here. - Why? - Just like that. lt's a trick to make the couple confess. Hurry up. Don't you want to leave? Hey, both of you. Look here.

What did you think about him? After seeing what you laughed? While a seed sprout. A full form will come out. He is born for fire. He grew up with eternity. On a right time, his own form will come out. Do you understand who he is? You can see him as fire. He created history by breaking obstacles. Can you remember? He is not a slave for anyone. He is not a king for anyone. He passes forest without disturbing its serenity. What did you think about him? After seeing what you laughed? While a seed sprout. A full form will come out. He is born for fire. He grew up with eternity. On a right time, his own form will come out. Multiple forms with different faces(Like God Krishna). Take the steps and get out when l tell you. The car is parked outside. Drive it to the front of the building. Two gun shots. Count to ten. lf l don't come out then, leave and tell Uncle ''code red''. What's code red?

Like small, small particles he'll reside under earth. While digging the earth the different faces will come out. Which face he'll take? Who'll know that? He'll take forms alternately from different faces. Do you understand who he is? You can see him as fire. He created history by breaking obstacles. Can you remember? How did he escape with so many of our men around? Why are you surprised? Remember, he trained the Al-Qaeda. Wisam Ahmad Kashmiri. A fighter for the Liberated Kashmir. Son of the late Kashmiri from Pakistan. The lndian army is offering half a million rupees for his head. He doesn't speak Pashto, but he speaks Tamil fluently. Half a million rupees is easy to get.

Brother Omar, the answer lies within your question. Death is a part of war. Jihadis like us don't shed tears. Only blood. Sheik! Sheik! Leave me. What's going on here? Tawfeeq says this Pakistani is a thief. The Pakistani says Tawfeeq is an American spy. What? The Pakistani has already been thrashed before. He wants revenge! Where's the proof? He says the proof is in Tawfeeq's bag. Check it yourself. Check it. There's only opium in here. He sells it for us. Tawfeeq, you're a good man. Omar, what is this? You know what it is. No, what is it? l really don't know Salim, what's this? A hi-tech locator, made in the USA. The Americans used this signal to find our location. Hold this. My gratitude to Allah, Lord of all. May he bless and protect all his families and followers. Save my son! We are carrying out Allah's punishment of this guilty man. l'm not guilty. l'm not guilty! Yes...yes. Tawfeeq! Save my son! Allah is great. Praise be to Allah. This is due to your own deeds. Allah is never unjust to His followers. The ill you intended for others has befallen you. Let him go. He is innocent. Go away. ln the name of Allah and with His will. Praise be to Allah. Wisam! Hey, Kashmiri! Look at them. What have they done to your brother? Ok, alright you are set, have a good day sir. Sir, excuse me sir. What ever happened Wisam was one of us? No...no. He is the enemy. He turned my family to ashes. You don't know the full story. That's why you trust him. Abu, clear the apartment. Leave no trail. This is urgent. Let's clear the apartment now. This project was in planning for at least three years. Your oncology machines are used to treat cancer patients, right? When your international customers sent you their machines... ...for repairs or replacement. - Make a left. - l know. Omar's men would first scrape the Cesium from those machines... ...and only then send them to you. Get it? Like Aladdin and his magic lamp! Exchange old lamps for new ones... ...and the genie is in Omar's hands. No way! Cesium can't be scraped off by hand like that. Do you know what will happen if radioactive material. lsn't handled under proper lab conditions? What? Radiation exposure. ln Tamil. Radiation exposure. What? What's your problem? Nothing at all, madam. Just clearing my throat. Please continue. - Where was l? - Cesium. lf you handle Cesium without gloves or masks, the handler will die slowly, in six or seven months, as if from cancer. Actually, it is cancer in a way. Correct. Remember when they held us in the warehouse? They had those cargo containers, like a hospital ward, with men lying in them? Oh, no! They handled Cesium with their bare hands? But why? Jihadis. They know no fear. Unlike other Jihadis who die at the push of a button. These are suicide bombers... ln slow motion. They are prepared to die slowly to kill their enemies. And their leader is my comrade, Omar Qureshi. Who is Omar? The one who tried to overtake us in the car. The man with the... He became like that thanks to the Cesium. God save us. Which God? - Now, look here... - We'll discuss that later. l want a detailed list of Deepak's customers, accounts and addresses. But why? Why should we do this? This is the police's job. lt's more complicated. Besides, this is beyond NYPD jurisdiction. But within yours? lt's no time to argue You saw what happened, right? Right! You killed a lot of them. You rescued me. Thank you for that. But this is wrong. You need a code to open the safe. We know that, honey. We bugged your entire office. You bugged our office? Oh god see this is what l'm saying. l don't know who you are. Who are you? Are you good or evil? Why didn't you ask this man that question? - He's dead. - So what? Does death wash away sins? So come on, let's then forgive Hitler! This money is blood soaked. The blood of innocents. l've done a lot of good and bad in my life. Some of my sins cannot be erased even by death. To answer your question. l'm a mix of both. l'm hero and a villain, l'm good and l'm bad. What's that noise? Let's go! Let's go! Wisam get out of there, now now now. What's this? lt's a high-tech locator, made in the USA. The Americans used this signal to find our location. Hold this. You rascal! lmtiaz, what have you done? l told you to get it out of the bag and destroy it. Why do you disobey my orders? Sir, the Pakistani saw me opening Tawfeeq's bag. l was going to do it later... ...but he raised hell. l'm sorry. You are sorry. Tawfeeq will die because of us. - Allah will not forgive us. - Us? You mean 'you'? lmtiaz is a pseudonym, not my religion. Do l have your permission to leave? Sir. Dismiss. My gratitude to Allah, Lord of all. May he bless and protect all his families and followers. Kashmiri, save my son! l have a lot of emotional baggage. l don't have time to discuss it now. We have to stop Omar and his gang. Their accounts are in your computer. So please help me. You need the password. - The password is moolah. - Moolah. - Yeah it's moolah... - Yeah moolah, but? Abbasi your service is needed today. l thought we have more time. Why you have problem? No no. l'm ready. - Allah is the greatest. - Allah is the greatest. Salaam aleikum, my name is Munnavar. You have a packet for me. You? You are Munnavar? Yeah! l converted. Look l have no time.

Ok wise guy how did you know about the pigeons? Many years ago we spoke about it. We...who? Omar and l. Don't mess with me. What if we detonated a nuclear device in New York City? How do we take a nuclear device there? l have a plan. We'll need many Jihadis. Won't you ask me how? How? We'll tie tiny capsules of Cesium or Plutonium to the legs of pigeons. To the pigeons of New York City. The radiation detecting Geiger counters will go crazy. They will feel stupid for mistaking pigeons for Jihadi bombs. And when they relax...

Until then, the story continues. What did you think about him? After seeing what you laughed? When a seed sprouts a full form will come out. He is born for fire. He grew up with eternity. On a right time, his own form will come out. He's our only live agent. Like small, small particles, he'll reside under earth. While digging the earth the different faces will come out. Wisam was a loyal lndian. He is one, and will always be. Which face he'll take? Who'll know that? He'll take forms alternately from different faces. Do you understand who he is? You can see him as fire. He created history by breaking obstacles. Can you remember? He is not a slave for anyone. Let them go, Nasser sir. These are children of the land. He passes forest without disturbing its serenity. What did you think about him? After seeing what you laughed? When a seed sprouts a full form will come out. He is born for fire.
