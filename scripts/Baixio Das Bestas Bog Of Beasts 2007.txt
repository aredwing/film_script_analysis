There are those who say that in the end, time always wins. One day it swallows up the mill, just as it swallows up you and me. What a fucking old bastard! Cocksucking son of a fucking bitch! Look at her little cunt around. - Good morning, Mrio. - Good morning! Are you better? And I've been ill, by any chance? Sit down, man. Now I've heard it all. I'll tell you one thing, Mrio. That talk we were having. I was thinking. There's no honour left in the world unwounded. No moral unbetrayed. And today, even more so, what with so much filth and immorality in the world. I just don't know. - It's really shameful. - Yes. Why, just yesterday, on television, on that game show... that girl who brings on the contestants... hasn't got a penny to buy herself a decent outfit. Wiggling swinging her buttocks from one side to the other. And what an arse she's got on her, that's for sure! I know. There's no respect left any more. And you know why, don't you Mrio? There're no real men any more. With morals. With a sense of shame. With a voice of authority. Today, they're worse than a wet dream. It was different in the old days. There was some authority - shame. Whores had shame, the betrayed had shame. Today, it's just become fashion. And Maninho, is he still digging that cesspool? Huh, that one. He doesn't know his arse from his elbow. He gave me an IOU for his work and pays it partying. Either he's digging this devil of a hole, this cesspool here, or he's dancing around with your lot. It won't do to keep on changing half way through the game like he does. Well, that's my opinion. Take it or leave. It's not quite so cut and dried, Heitor. Maninho is an artist! On all counts. But you're always having a go at him. Me? Having a go at him? Auxiliadora! We're going over to the filling station tonight. They say it's been busy. A lot of truck drivers. So this afternoon, go and get the washing, take it over to the women's house, and then we'll meet in the square and go there. I'm talking to you. I'm saying that tonight we'll go over to the filling station, 'cos they're busy. Are you taking the piss... or what? I'm telling you that tonight we're going over to the filling station... 'cos they're busy. When someone speaks, how does the other one answer? All right. All right. This is all I needed. Oh my girl! - Can I switch the tv on? - No! You're not gonna waste your time with that. You'd better come and have lunch now. And leave the house in order, so you can go out this afternoon. Come on! Oh God! I have to raise my voice now, do I? Ccero, are you going to lie there all day long? Can't go and pick up the shopping. Can't take the van to be washed. Is there nothing you could be doing? I spend the week studying in Recife, and then here I'm turned into a skivvy. - Oh! Ccero. - I'm fucking knackered! What? Everyone here works all week, everybody does everything. It so happens that I'm fucking shagged out. I only study because you all make me. Not 'all'! Your father doesn't give a hoot if you study or not. Oh! Are you still dating that girl? Kind of. Later on I'm taking the car out with Everardo and the boys. Everardo this, Everardo that. Why doesn't this Everardo stay with his own kind? Mmm? There's a party out at a friend's farm, mum. We're all going. What farm is this that I know nothing about, hey Ccero? Listen, will you be coming back next week? Ah. So you can bring back those plants I ordered. For fuck's sake! You're already giving me orders for next week? Excuse me, excuse me! For the love of God, I didn't want to offend! I only asked a little favour. What car shall I take, huh? I'll get the van. The owner of Galisa has again denied that his company... uses excessive amounts of hormones in their chicken production. He said that nothing over the limits are permitted. And that the use of hormones at his company... is completely within accepted limits. And to say that it's absolutely ridiculous... that the excessive use of hormones is causing undesirable... hair growth in women - it's only you, the listeners, who can clear up this problem. The radio company would like to invite all women who are suffering... from the growth of a moustache or chest hair... to come forward and help prove the accusations. That's the way we work here... one word from our listeners and we expose the culprits! Hey! Move yourself Arlindinho. He's always under our feet. Margarida said the boys are coming over later. Oh fuck! How to bear that fucking lot. I don't want to set eyes on that Everardo. He still owes for the last time. When I think of the kind of things he likes doing, it turns my stomach. Sick bastard! Well, you can just get used to the idea, 'cos they're coming. They wanted us to go over to that cinema. No way I'm going there. It's a fucking nightmare that place! I like the parties with the boys. I've never been to this cinema, but I'd go without any hassle. So go! If you like having the shit beaten out of you. If you're so hooked on being thrashed. You're love a good thrashing! You fucking vulture. If you can't take the heat stay away from the fire! All right? Stupid fucking cow! You love being beaten. You love wearing the stirrups. Yes, I do. I want to find myself some old man. To look after me and give me a good home. Heh Ceia! Who's gonna want a shagged out old vulture like this? Not even some old fart is gonna want you, my girl. - I'll fucking show you! - Come on then. Stop it Dora! Sit down Bela. I'm shitting myself with fear! I'm off. I'm not gonna stoop to your level. I'm trembling to death because of the old vulture! Go on vulture. Fly. Go hit yer head on the ceiling. As if I give a fuck what you think. Vulture. Go and lie down, dearie. We've got a fucking hard day ahead of us. Yeah! A really "fucking" hard day. What is it that you want from me? Why this voice? Why this silence? Why don't you tell me what You're thinking about? I don't want to be shrinking back There was a right bloody shoot out! Huh! And the bastards still came back? They fucking did! Both of the wankers. Didn't you know the culprits always return to the scene of the crime? And back they went, if you please? Hey pisser! I've found The Minge Eaters, come and see! I'd never have gone back. Not to be fucking arrested. Imagine being fucking arrested. Dad said that if I ever had to deal with anyone - pah - pah - pah. Just pull the trigger and run back home and he'll solve it all. Not difficult if your old man is a policeman. Go and check on the point forty, under the seat. This film is fucking great! Fucking hell. Can't even get his fucking cock up. It's the famous floppy cock, hey? He must be pissed out of his brain. It's gonna be cock and cunt all night long, just look at that! Give it and take it, give it and take it. I'm feeling fairly spaced out, all right? I gave Maria Jos a good poke yesterday. Fucking hell. You're shagging her every fucking day? Every fucking day. Yesterday I gave her a good poking. Hey Ccero, does she still cry? No fucking way! After she went whimpering to her fucking mother, I took her to one side and told her the more she whimpered the angrier I'd get, and there'd be shit to pay. And that sister of hers? That fucking slut is getting shagged in Recife. I bumped into her the other night, pissed out of her brain. You didn't give her one? Of course you didn't. Only messed about a bit. Dad slipped her one though. He's too fucking much. Look! We're meeting there after ten, aren't we? Yeah. I've got a few things to sort out and then we'll meet over at Margarida's. Oh! Fuck off! Give me that fucking shit! Fucking hell! Calm down! It's no fucking good! You fucking son of a whore! Where the fuck has this van got to? Oh, for fuck's sake. Where's the money Auxiliadora? - Have you still got any washing to do? - Yes, sir. We've run out of soap. So when you go over on Wednesday to get the washing, you can buy some. Got to occupy this girl's mind, otherwise the devil'll take it over! Come on! Here's the car with the special offers. Bread, biscuits, cakes, sweets. Don't waste time! I'll be in Salgueiro at least by morning. I'll only be able to sleep then. If not. No fucking cargo nor nothing. Good evening. How are you doing? - How are things? - Fine. And down at the bog? How are things down there? Now that they're cutting sugar cane again things have picked up. And here? What's business like here? Ah, I can't complain. Everybody's raring for some fun tonight... and I think there'll be more drivers in later. I'm going over to the church. So when they arrive, send them over. Don't worry I'll send them over sure enough. Bye. Look who it is. The old man. The old man? Didn't I tell you he'd be here? The old devil never misses. - Let's go over? - Come on! I can't wait to see the girl! - Let's get going then? - I'll get the bill! That's it, Auxiliadora. Home. Move yourself. With this money, I'm going to have the front of the house paved. And while I'm at it, I'll cut that tree down too. I'll get Maninho to do it. Pretty! What are you after? Come on pretty girl, get in. Jump in. After what? After what? - You fucking little bastard. - What is it? Fucking bastard. Take this, you fat prick! You fucking son of a whore. Up your fucking arse! I was just thinking that on your own you're going to take much longer... than you promised to dig that cesspool. Heitor is going on and on about it. Just as well he hasn't got back from town yet. Why not get the boys to lend a hand? Do you think so? They'll be going over to dance maracatu tomorrow. If they don't, there'll be no fun at all. Can you smell something strange? It must be the sugar mill. Rubbish! You think I don't know the smell from the sugar mill? This is the rottenes of the wopld. I called by the filling station again, Everardo. Fucking hell, she's shit hot. I was coming here and I saw her and the old man waiting for the van. Just think! Absolute misery. A locksmith once told me you can open whatever door you want. You want to break open the safe. Is that what you want? So spread open the girl's legs! But there's more. Oh! They say she's a virgin. Just think. Even more so being the daughter of that fucking grandfather of hers! - She's the old man's daughter? - The gradfather's daughter. What a fucking bastard! I told the old fucker to go fuck himself. He just stood there shaking like a leaf. Stupid old bastard! Hey. I remembered you a lot this week. Last Thursday, some guy there in Recife drank so much he died. Imagine! The bastard wakes up with a stinking hangover - dead! Come on slags! Come on. Close the doors and off with your clothes. Cocks are throbbing and ready for it. Let's go everybody! Everybody naked! Everybody stripped! You sons of bitches. Arlindinho, where's the fucking butter. I want to fuck arse. Close this fucking door. It's cock, now it's cunt! Everardo's gonna fuck the old vulture. Gonna shove it up her arse I want arse, I want arse. Where's the butter? Maninho. Are you still poking around with this damned hole? I'm just straightening it up. I can only dig deeper tomorrow. And you have to work at night? Today I had to, because during the day I had things to do. But tomorrow morning I'll be here bright and early! First thing. These people know exactly how to get to me! Always trying my patience. There's the whole world to dig this hole in, but no, it has to be right next to my house. Very good. So I'll have to spend the rest of my old age... Iooking after the shit of the world. Huh! All right. Come on, in you go. Said you were tired, and now just standing there daydreaming! Get out here of! Fucking old git! Fuck her Everardo. Fuck her, fuck her, fuck her! Fuck her! Go on Everardo! Fuck her. Split the bitch right open. Get the butter. Die you fucking slag! I don't know if I left it here, or at the Town Hall, I really don't. I'm almost sure I left it... Mum! My head is fucking splitting! Shut the fuck up. I'll end up dying. No you won't. I wonder if your father picked this envelope up? I'm going to get the car, ok? - Have you had lunch? - Not yet. I only want fried eggs and beans. With a runny yolk. But burnt underneath. - Where are you going with the car? - For a drive round. Ccero, my boy, be carfeul with your life! Amara! You can fry his egg, you hear? And put it on the table. He's about to have lunch. I have to get going. If you find that envelope call me on the mobile, all right? I need it urgently. Bye! What do you intend to do with this? I don't see any reason. It's of more use than playing around with that maracatu dance troupe. There's dancing today! We're going to rehearse for the parade in Recife on Saturday. They're paying us quite well for it. Quite well, huh? I'll believe that one, Mrio. They're paying us one thousand, five hundred, plus snacks! You'll all get rich very soon! It's better than cutting sugar cane. Even sugar mills don't exist any more. Cutting cane Mrio is real work. Clowning around in the middle of the streets, that's not work. This one spends his whole day whistling. Why the devil do the poor like whistling so much? He's poor but he's happy. You're always going on about something. Let the people dance, man. Don't know why they invented this idea of a cesspool here. I've never seen a cesspool take as long as this one. I've seen a birth last five days, a flood of four days, but I've yet to see anything as slow as this, do you hear? You're quite something, aren't you, Heitor? All poor old Maninho wants to do is to help. Working every Saturday and Sunday, and all you do is moan! I don't know. You're an addicted moaner. I don't know. All he wants to do is fill his face with booze. Nothing gets done. It's just booze and more booze. My God! I don't like the people from Recife. They don't know how to enjoy themselves. When I was studying there, for three semesters, I came back! There was fuck all to learn there. You're really brainy. Brainy. Mum says its 'cos you read a lot. It's been a long time since I heard somebody saying that... Yeah. But you are. You're fucking clever. No. I'm cynical and arrogant. Are you? Really? I can't talk like that. Let's do some shooting? With bets? That envelope of your mother's against that whisky I've got at home. - Get it? - No! I knew it. What's up? You're early? The van passed earlier. I came to see you. Well. Have you got something good for us today. Do you like dancing? You don't know how much. There's a sambada today. Don't you want go dancing? Grandpa wouldn't let me. He's calling. I'll say you're going with us. Look, you'll go, won't you? You arrive home and instead of coming straight in, you go winding up this imbecil. Idiot! If it wasn't for Mrio, I'd still be on the bed. Where's the money? Haven't they sent the money? Not even for the medicine? Dona Nomia said that I'd gone too early. She'll only have the money next Wednesday. These bloody people! The more they have the less they help. If I could, I'd shove all these people onto a bus, set fire to it and then bury them all head first. And when they were right down, I'd slice off their heads with a sickle. What are you looking at? Haven't you got anything to be doing? Get through there! God in heaven! If firewater be the devil, then why drink? If the glass be big, why fill it up? Cheers! I don't agree that it's too little. Everyone will get something. And there's money for the group! We'll get fifty each. And they're going to lay on snacks. I'm taken in by it. It's not enough. It's not worth it! - Oh brother, it's enough. - It's not, it's not! Where to get more? Little by little, we'll get there. It's important to be on show. We can arrange more presentations. All those people watching us. For free. You say that we... It's a long presentation. You get money in carnival, but not now! But it's already been arranged, hasn't it? Sure. What can you do? Maninho's got it right, for sure. He only dances here, but never the parades. If Maninho didn't like dancing, he'd never come here. Are you gonna do his work for him? You go and dig the cesspool. Calm down! Calm down Brazil! Calm! All right. Let's stop right here. And drink. Sure. This is getting to be a real pain? You know who I met in Recife this week? Rutili. - Chicken Rutili! - Chicken Rutili. Have you ever split open a chicken with him? He held it by the wings, opened it up and shoved it all the way inside. The chicken went - Cooo! Cooo! We served it up on mum's birthdy! Remember? The whole family ate that slimy chicken, covered in cum! Even dad ate it! Like the marijuana cake on your birthday. Fucking hell. Hit it! Hit it. Hit the little motherfucker! This is the monoculture of cock and cunt. You see? You see? Did you see that? This fucking thing won't work. Last week was fucking great, wasn't it? Huh! You're such a fucking slag, you know that? You like confusion. And you don't? I know you too well! And as for the fucking beating that the vulture took. It was like he knew the slagbag was asking for a good thumping. The funniest thing was Everardo's face, covered in blood. It was almost in the eye. Talk about a good slapping. Huh! She deserved much more, the stupid bitch. He kicked her head so much like it was a fucking football. I though it was great! Arlindinho hasn't come. And I wanted to take advantage of this break to get some cleaning done. Have you ever seen the like? Cleaning on a Saturday night. My dear! I believe this is my house. So, I do and think what I want, when I want. Things are hotting up around here today! But little sadistic me is going to watch tv. You're too much! Ceia! If a client comes in, give me a shout. Arlindinho's father asked me to find the boy some work. I did. And what does the little thing go and do? He doesn't turn up. Can you trust him? I fucking killed him. - At least you didn't damage the car. - Oh fuck! - What's the news? And? - Dead and gone. He's not fucking dead. He's not. You're fucking me about, man. Ah! Go shove it up your fucking arse. He's dead, you motherfucker. He's alive! You son of a bitch! Thank god! Fucking hell! Fucking hell! Did anyone say anything? Nothing! Nobody saw anything for fuck's sake. Nobody knows anything. I can still see the car spinning round. Like this. Fucking hell. It was lucky. He should have been killed. He was lucky. Motherfucker. When did these bastards die easily? The poor don't die easy. If they did they'd all be dead by now. Poverty is like cancer. It'll soon destroy everything left in the world, Then, when you notice - it's already got you I the lung. Poverty is going to socialise the world. I need to go over to the filling station. Take this. It's too late? Time's getting on. Where the fuck are you going? The fool is in love. You're in love with a whore, are you? Go and fuck your bitch, motherfucker. That bitch of my father's is selling this cinema. Just think! Fucking slag. You know the best thing about the cinema? In the cinema you can do whatever you like. Auxiliadora! How many times do I have to tell you? I don't want you using that fish knife. Go to bed! What's all this about Maninho, hey? I'm talking to you, Auxiliadora. You're not winding up Maninho, are you? Going down the same path as your mother! Shameless slag. Come here! Come on! If not, I'll break your back! You know I do this for your good, don't you? Go to bed. My god, it's so hot! Crazy bastard! Hey, Maninho, hey! You fill your face with firewater... and now you're swaying around like a bamboo rod. I take it there'll be no work done today? And what's that to you? You've got nothing to do with this! If I drink that's up to me! No you're right, Your drinking is none of my business. Thank God! But this open hole that you've left here is my business. Brazil will have an emperor again before you finish this job. What? This is really something, huh? Well, I'm gonna tell you a thing or two... Oh Maninho! Go home. Stick your finger down your throat. Throw up. And then rest your head on the pillow. The day's hardly begun. I wanted to talk to Auxiliadora. Call her out here. Now you're going a little bit too far. You shameless devil! Show some respect! If not, I'll break your back for you. Respect? To you? And what do you know about respect? Everyone here knows all about your respect. I'm gonna wait for her to appear. And I want to see if you dare say anything. Are you mad or what? You pest! Fuck it. I'm going home. Go! You cretin. Hey Auxiliadora, come outside! Look here, Maninho! Don't play around with me. Come on Auxiliadora. Come with me. You think it's a cesspol that I'm digging. But it's not. It's your grave, creature from hell. Go to hell. Come out Auxiliadora. I'm waiting for you! Go home, boy. Idiot! Auxiliadora is mine! Go away. I'm going. You just go on and on. I want to see you six feet under. Six feet under. Auxiliadora could be here with me. Families! Fucking families. Load of shit! They're spiritual snails. You know what I do with them! Look what I do with them. I squash with my hands! You see? And your mother? Fucking dog! What a fucking bitch! The fucking slag doesn't even treat me... like a member of the family. Forget it. Forget it. To Ceasar what comes from Ceasar. Even here things are beinning to fall apart. Falling apart. Fuck! But then what can you expect? Smoking dope in front of the whole family? I don't owe explanations to anyone! Bunch of fucking wankers. That's why I say! With this hand I stroke the devil's head... And with this other one, just fucking watch out! I wonder if she'll show up today? What? That little tyke from the filling station. Heh! I wonder if she'll turn up today? She didn't go last week. Then you said that she's the gradfather's daughter. Isn't that so? That's what the people say. What a fucking farce! That made me feel... fuck me! I'm off home, you hear? I don't give a fucking toss about them at home. Go. Go. I'm gonna take this bastard film. Bastard film. Today, I'm off to Recife With all the people here Today, I'm off to Recife With all the people here To show them how to dance The rural maracatu That row is going to start any minute now... Auxiliadora! When you take the washing this afternoon and get the money... she does know you're going to pick up the money? All right. So, get the money and go over to the filling station. We need to get some cash coming into this house. I don't like it either. But needs must be. You're a big girl now. You know right from wrong. So go to Dona Angelina's, tell her we need this... and that she should take care of you. And to give you the money afterwards. I trust you. Mind my words. Ccero? Ccero. Ccero, my boy. Ccero, wake up! I'm talking to you. Ccero! You're such a fucking pain in the arse. What did you say? You fucking deaf or what? Don't talk to your mother like that. Don't talk to your mother like that. Why not? Where are you going? - Where are you off to? - I've got to go out. It's already four o'clock. To sign out the cars for the maracatu from the bog. And you wake me up to tell me that? No! I woke you up to feel irritated. Surrounded by a load of useless males. Oh God! Dona Margarida's moaning the whole day long. If only I had the money. It's getting more difficult to be free of this shit. But at first you said this was the best place you'd worked. That before, you never got paid. Better than getting involved with these sugar people. I want a future. Oh! You want to get married now, like Bela. Shut the fuck up about the vulture. I hope she's dead. Fucking slag. Oh Dra, weren't you supposed to be doing the bathrooms today? The afternoon's almost over and I haven't seen one bucket of water. - Calm down. I'm going in a minute. - In a minute - no! Everyone here has their duty. But not Dora! She's better than anyone else. The queen. My dear, "now" means "now"! I've already told you I'm gonna clean the fucking bathroom! Fuck. She's on at us the whole fucking day here. But not at night. Because then there's no clients in this miserable chicken hut. You don't like it? Pack your up shit, and drag that tired cunt of yours elsewhere. Don't worry, I'm off tomorrow. I said now. Little miss slag. In my house, if you don't show me respect! Out! Now slut, now! Now! This is the moment. I should have gone ages ago. Anyone disagrees with this? If there is and you want to leave, best leave now. I give the orders. I am watching you. Things are getting too soft around here. I know what's waiting for me in Recife With pleasure and happiness And if Jesus helps It'll be a poetic show Son of a bitch! Go on, go on! Son of a whore! Let's get going! I've drunk one hell of a lot today. Just one more and die. Look, it's that fucking slag. Let's give her a good going over? Let's fuck her over? Hey little Dora. Come over here. Come on. Let's go then. Come on! Today, my luck has turned! Finally. Let's bless her. Let's go to the cinema. Shall we? Where are you taking me? It is something dirty? Let's go son of a bitch! Don't go so fast Everardo. Careful! What kind of time do you call this, Maninho? Your thick head's better now... so you thought you'd come banging round here... - Isn't it a little late for that? - I've alread said that... Look! I certainly didn't like the liberty you took with Auxiliadora. I didn't take any lilberties with anyone. I just hope that you don't carry on this way. And that when you finish the cesspool, you disappear. I never want to see you around my house ever again. Understand? Finish your work and good night. Just you wait! Oh! The old boy didn't come today? I've brought her today. She's under my control tonight. If you want to touch, you'll have to pay. There it is. First class. An angel. To touch her, it's another business. There's your business. Ok. That's enough. There's a queue. Mind the queue. Leave this to me now. Come on. Come on. Get your knickers off. Go on get them off. "Come, come, come... You need imagination to live..." Go on whore. Show us your cunt. Get it out. Get those little tities out! "I don't want to get hurt any more... In this dream where I wake up alone..." We don't want any of this misery shit. Come on bitch. "Come, come... I cry without any comfort..." Get 'em off. This fucking vodka is running out. Go on Everardo. He almost fell over. Hey, just a minute. Calm down everybody. I'll have to charge a lot for this. This is expensive. Let me go! I've had enough of this. Let me go! Hey! No! Let me go! Shut your fucking mouth, slag! Hold on to her. Stop it. Shut your mouth bitch. Go on! Shove it in, shove it up her. Poke the fucker right up inside her! You need this shoved up your fucking arse. Shove the pole up her fucking arse. Rip her fucking insides to bits. Black, whore and poor... you're meant to have it shoved up the arse. Let the fucking slag go. Get out. Come on, out! You're mine now. Mine. You're mine. Get up! Walk! Lean on here. Let me see... Take this fucking thing off. You take it off. Come on. Come on. Take it off. I'll shoot you right in the fucking face, . What'll the old man say to that? Take this fucker off. Now. Stay calm. Get hold of this. Take it, go on! Take it. It doesn't hurt. It won't hurt, pretty girl. It won't hurt. Take it all, pretty girlie. Feel that head! Take it whore. Garbage! Get in here! Auxiliadora what's this, hey? What was this? Have you betrayed me? My confidence? Was this at the filling station? You slag. A roadside slag. Is that what you want? Cocksucker. Who did this? This was Maninho, wasn't it? Well, if it wasn't him, then it certainly wasn't a work of God. You're not going to do to me what your mother did. You fucking slag. Whore. Sickening dog. Get out of my house. You bastards. Out. Out. Maracatu is war! Gonna die! So! When did you get in. Two days ago. Tasty little morsel! See you round here after, ok? Take that you little devil. Tasty little piece of meat. - You like it here? - Sure. How long have you been here? Two days. Great. Are you always around here? Yeah. I'll be staying here now. I pass through here all the time. You hear? That one there - Give it and take it, give it and take it. I'm counting on her. In and out, in and out in and out. Take it you little urchin. May God hear you. May God hear you, because this one! But d'you think they'll really buy the sugar mill? I don't know. People appear around here to buy anything. And then everything goes back to how it was... Mill people are like that. When they have to pay up. They close down. When things are all right to make money - it opens. Did you see? They invaded the Suuarana Mill. - Again! - Again. They were there. And the old boy? Any news? - He's in a coma. - What? He's dying. You were his friend. You think he messed with the girl? I don't know and I don't want to know. And I get angry with anyone who does. They love talking about things here that they've never seen. - You know how that ends up? - No! Nor me. And will Auxiliadora stay at the filling station? I don't know. If she came back here - the girl'd be almost crippled. At least the woman there takes care of her. They're almost Heitor's family. So pretty. If I could, I'd bring her here and keep with her. Huh!
