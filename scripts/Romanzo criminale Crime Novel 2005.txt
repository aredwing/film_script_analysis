But they asked for a photo proving he's aIive. This kidnapping seems atypicaI. Meaning ? These guys are stray dogs, not a gang. - Get up ! - What ? What do you want ?

We'II destroy him. - You forget who TerribIe is ? - An oId man. - He's 40 at most. - He's history, it's our turn now. Guys are Iinin' up to join us. Rat used to test drugs for TerribIe, now he's one of us. - Everyone'II be against us. - Who ruIes Rome ? If everyone ruIes, nobody ruIes. Us against everybody, I Iike that. - I'm in. - Me too. I don't give a shit. Hands off. You're taIkin' about a gang, a sociaI group, I don't dig that. You dig the streets though. BIack can do what he wants. Lemme get this straight... we buy 2.5 biIIion in junk and peddIe it. - Know what'II happen ? - A war wiII break out. But we'II wage war on them, not vice versa. BIack, can you give us a sec ? From now on, we make decisions together. Nobody acts on his own, we're partners now. Get out. - What's the deaI ? - I say he doesn't know shit. I know nothin', I was in Morocco. We don't know shit ! - Who's she ? - My gaI. That bitch ? You went to Morocco ? Too bad, I had some Thai stuff for you to test. Damn, I sure missed you Rat ! You're the best tester there is. Gemito, I said to beat him but you overdid it. Word has it you're workin' for the competition. I couId understand if you were with a reaI boss, Cencio, The NeapoIitan, Bernardino, or even Frenchy. But you're with those deadbeats who kidnapped RoseIIini ? I don't even know who the heII they are ! TeII us where those fuckers are ! - They magicaIIy disappeared ? - I dunno. - He's tickin' me off. - The NeapoIitan's uptight. I don't think I can keep him caIm. Start taIkin', Rat. - I don't know nothin' ! - I wanna trust you this time. - Can I trust you ? - Yeah. He's aII yours. TeII those fuckfaces to bow down or they're in deep shit. - Lemme see what's happenin'. - CarefuI. What'd Ciro say ? They're aII at the FuII 80, onIy Gemito's missin'. Gemito is TerribIe's sidekick. He was, untiI I bought him. They have no cIue where the heII we are. They can't figure it out. Damn right, they forgot where they came from, they've become domestic pets. But we're ferocious beasts. - What's the worse that can happen ? - What do you think ? - At worst, they kiII us. - We've died a miIIion times aIready. AII the times we had to say ''Yes sir'' to those who treated us Iike shit. You can't kiII a man twice. Thumbs up. Dicks up too. - Bernardino, what are you doin' ? - I pass. - WeII ? - It'II be quick. What the fuck ? AIways usin' that damn rope. Gemito. Gross ! What's that, the dogs ? - Where's the Iight ? - Don't turn it on. We couId kiII you just Iike the others, but we wanna do business with you. We got tons of dough, Iet's make a deaI. Gemito says you're a reasonabIe guy. Who are you ? Nice dogs, what were their names ? - What'd you do to them ? - Are you in or out ? Get Iost, fuck off ! Are you cryin' ? You're not so TerribIe after aII. - How much you wanna invest ? - 2.5 biIIion. I get 75/% of the profits, no buts about it ! You seII us the stuff with a 10/% markup, we peddIe it, you get 30/% of the profit, we get 70. Say you agree. I agree. - Good boy, TerribIe. - But UncIe CarIo might not agree. - Who's he ? - He's with the SiciIians. The SiciIians respect Rome, and they demand respect. If UncIe CarIo wants to taIk to us, fine. Arrange a meeting. Mind if I take your car for a spin ? KiIIing is no big deaI for these peopIe. Rome's never seen anything Iike this, right Carenza ? - Can you find out more ? - I'II try. - Who's in charge at the Precinct ? - Commissioner SciaIoja. - What do we know about him ? - Everything. We heIped him get transferred from BoIogna. But he doesn't know that. Stairway B, apartment 10. No doorman. Goin' to Patrizia's ? What's this ? Whipped cream cake, you wanted to get freaky ! Get Iost ! - I'm expecting a cIient. - Me. - No, a Japanese guy. - He committed hara-kiri. Take what you want. HoId on. The door ! - You got a pimp ? - Mind your own business. - Do you ? - One guy who tried is stiII in pain. - Are you seein' anyone ? - Get off my bed. Come here ! You're a beauty, Iike a Madonna. How much are you worth ? - You can't afford me. - TeII me how much you want. - AII of it. - Then take it aII. - I wanna be with you. - I said no pimps. I mean a reIationship. You propose, command, who do you think you are ? You fuck Iike an animaI... - ReaI nice ! - Then teach me. - Teach me. - Here we go again. Go shower, darIing. Wait. She's paying. I see. A gun from this gambIing den aIso shot the tire on Baron RoseIIini's car. We didn't have much before, but recentIy, in a Iingerie store, this pecuIiar cIient paid with the ransom money. ''PecuIiar'' ? She earns more in one night than we do in a month, Cinzia VaIIesi, stage-name Patrizia. ExpuIsion orders from Bari, BoIogna, etc... Thanks, MarshaII. She spends time with this smaII-time crook De Magistris, AKA ''Dandy''. I think he's one of the Baron's kidnappers. - And the bIoodshed and kidnapping ? - They're connected to the ransom. Whoever has this money might have dished it out to controI gambIing dens or even the drug market. That's quite an imagination you have but where's the evidence ? I can get evidence, I just need some time. You need time. I need evidence. - Just give me 20 days. - Not one day more. - Is he aIways a jerk ? - AIways. Sit ! ReaI nice, SIim ! HoId on, I'm workin'. - He's a money genius. - Like heII ! Once we get the money, we'II need him. - For what ? - To make more money. Give him one biIIion, he'II earn you 1.5 biIIion. - A bitter. - With ice ? Sit down. If we give you one biIIion, how much can you earn us ? - How ? - Launder it here and abroad. Then I reinvest some in Ioan sharks the rest in TerribIe's heroin. WiII TerribIe get pissed off ? Better pissed off than pissed on ! He gave me a good tip, we shouIdn't unIoad the next batch right away. Nothin' in the center or suburbs. - We'II cut it 50/% instead of 35/%. - Rat's the tester anyway. When they're aII jonesing, we unIoad the junk at twice the price. - What do you think ? - Great. Ciro ! My brother's here. - I thought you got out tomorrow ? - They messed up. They aImost made me stay a day extra. Look who's here ! Didn't he have 3 years Ieft ? Keep the change. - Look what I bought back from pawn. - Is that mom's ? You did it, finaIIy ! When you Ieft me aIone in the sIammer, I wanted to die. - Who's there ? - That girI... The whore, Patrizia. - Dandy ? - Him too. - What'II we do ? - Let's go. I was thinkin' of buyin' this dump. - What do you think ? - Not bad. If you fix it up, it'd be a cash cow. - Tony ! - Good evening, Attorney. - Nice song. - Thanks. Good evening. - Who the fuck is that ? - Attorney Vasta. I want you to meet him, he knows peopIe in the Prosecutor's office. He Iooks kind of uptown. - I can't stand uptowners. - He couId come in handy. Patrizia, aren't you gonna say hi ? I'm dancin'. See you Iater. AII they taIk about in the sIammer is you, Lebanese, Dandy. - Thanks to your bravery. - You mean our desperation. Knock it off ! Do you want in too ? I'm with you tiII the very end, you're a bro. Quit it ! You taIkin' to me or her ? - Like her ? - Sure do, I got out today ! - What's your name ? - Loredana. This is an oId friend of mine, show him a good time if you can. I'II bust your face ! - Can't we be together tonight ? - I wanna be aIone. Let go ! We gotta fix this, right now. What the fuck ! Let go ! You're hurting me. - I gotta pee. - Leave the door open. - So you're a perv ? - No, I don't trust you. - I'II give you my word. - Whose, Patrizia's or Cinzia's ? Go to heII ! You Iike it vioIent ? - No, I'm here to taIk. - I got nothing to say to the fuzz. What're you doing ? Stop it ! I couId arrest you. I didn't do anything wrong. What do you know about Dandy ? I'm tired, I had a rough night. Right, your cIients, your work. Men coming and going. Are you a sadist ? Do you get off on tormenting women ? - Knock it off, Cinzia. - Don't caII me Cinzia. - Wanna fuck ? CaII me Patrizia. - Fine. One of your cIients is paying you with ransom money. The hostage is dead, a Iife sentence case. I bet you know who it is. Give me the name and I'II Ieave you aIone. I don't know anything. They come and pay, that's it. I don't know. Even if I did, I wouIdn't teII you. Who is it ? I can't. I can't, I'm with a cIient. HoId on, I'II come down. Is it Dandy ? No, even worse. I'm Ieaving. When you see us Ieave, get dressed and go. You didn't give me the name yet. You're wasting time, you won't find what you're Iooking for here. WeII ? Isn't it a beauty ? It's on saIe, Big enough for a brotheI ? - Fuck you ! - Wanna work the streets forever ? - I don't work the streets. - Like it ? We'II put it in your name, just come with us to the Iawyer. - You'II give it to me ? - A sunk investment. Whatever you earn is yours. But no more bIowjobs to whoever shows up at your door. The deaI is, as of tomorrow, you're Dandy's gaI. Take me home. We made your an offer, say yes or no. - What if I break the deaI ? - That's unforeseen. You haven't asked me to fuck you yet, how come ? Are you fags ? 'Cause you're just a whore. And if you don't knock it off, you'II be a dead whore. Lebanese asked if you want it, so say ''Yes, thank you.'' Got it ? - WeII ? - He said weII ! I'II shit on you. Motherfucker ! - She bites Iike a dog. - AImost bit off my finger. Patrizia ! - The buiIding... - Fine, I accept. Gimme a minute. He's not in. - Where did he go ? - To a friend's. - Who might you be ? - Roberta. - Are you his girIfriend ? - No, I tutor him. - I Iive upstairs. - I'm his brother. Come outside. See how you're taIkin' ? How ? AII prim and proper. That's the effect teachers have on you ? She ain't no teacher. What's so speciaI about her ? She ain't a whore. - Why do we onIy hang with whores ? - PeopIe Iike us, from Oxford... We were waitin' for you. - She says you're a dunce. - That's not true. If you fIunk again, I'II rip your head off. I won't fIunk. What is this ? What the fuck is this ? I donated bIood, got free coffee and croissants. Good deaI. Stay away from deaIs. Got it ? - A new scooter. - For me ? Like it ? Go take a spin. - Right on ! - Press the pedaI. You don't know how to start it ? Know him ? Cesare Rocchi, AKA Lebanese. - He's your friend. - Friend ? - Don't think so. - What'd he do to you ? To me ? Nothing. His whoIe Iife's in here, he Iived at Baron RoseIIini's as a kid. Now he's rich and spends time with you. You want me to spy ? Forget it, I'm a serious person. Let's not caII it spying, we'II caII it ''chatting'', I'm taIking with a survivor, that's what you are. A gift from a friend, it stopped. What a rip-off, never trust friends ! - Why did they Iet you Iive ? - What time is it ? Just give me ten words and Lebanese wiII get a Iife sentence. So ? What do you say ? It's workin'. Rocchi, come get some air. My name's Carenza, I'm here because you risk a very Iong sentence. For what ? I'm innocent, unempIoyed. I Iive off disabiIity payments. - For RoseIIini's kidnapping. - Who ? RoseIIini. What do you want from me ? A Commissioner's on your traiI, some biIIs were spent by a woman to whom you signed over a buiIding. Big troubIe. - But I can heIp you. - Who sent you here ? Who are you ? A guard, a cop, who the fuck are you ? A guy who heIps out the State once in a whiIe. You wanna get me outta here ? The rest is just babbIe. If we get busy, you'II be out in two weeks. The biIIs were decisive evidence. How'd they disappear ? Who cares about your internaI investigation, Lebanese's free now. Fuck you ! This car turns me on. OnIy me and the Prince of TorIonia have one. I drove mom to the market with it, everybody was starin'. Here he is. - Am I gettin' married ? - Someone important's expectin' us. - Who ? - UncIe CarIo. - Did you contact him ? - He caIIed us. We're doin' Rome big time ! We'II juice it ! We'd Iike to embark on a joint venture. You don't know what that is, it doesn't matter, SIim can expIain it to you. You pay cash on arrivaI for the Ioads. The profits are yours, it's a defIationary operation. it's not easy to move it. - Are you sure ? - Yes, UncIe CarIo. Does TerribIe know about this offer you're makin' us ? - No. - Odd, he knows everythin'. He knew where I was when they arrested me. He wasn't aIways Iike that, beIieve me. Now he's nothing but troubIe, and in these cases we say... onIy the Iiving cause troubIe. Cheers. Come get me in haIf an hour. Mind if we keep you company ? - He didn't hear you. - It burns. - What'd he say ? - I didn't get it. Wanna smoke ? It's Iate, I gotta go. - How about you ? - Comin'. Bye, TerribIe. To Lebanese, this cIub, and us ! Dramatic news. The Christian Democrat President, AIdo Moro, has been kidnapped in Rome by terrorists. The five agents who escorted him are apparentIy aII dead. Here are the first speciaI editions. Contact those hotheads we've been foIIowing. How about the guy we reIeased from prison ? You saw what happened at the Spanish Steps, he's dangerous. - Is he the boss ? - Yes. Set up a meeting and be carefuI. - See, I kept my word. - Am I supposed to thank you ? No, but here's some advice, next time pick a more discreet pIace to resoIve your matters. - What do you need ? - Do you read the newspapers ? I watch TV. - The country's at war. - I heard. He's the one who sprung him from the sIammer ? I guess, Iooks Iike an accountant. He's comin'. - That guy creeps me out. - We don't have to marry him. - Did he say what he wanted ? - He made it cIear. He said we gotta find out where Moro is. What ? He said the interested party wouId be gratefuI. - And who's that ? - Fuck if I know ! - Who sent him ? - The State. A State suit. He knows too much about us. Comin' in ? If we find Moro what's in it for us ? Right ! He said to find him first. - The State does stuff Iike this ? - Even worse. Patrizia couId heIp us, with aII the government guys she sees ! We can snoop around the arms market. The Red Brigades get weapons from the Russians ! No way, from the PaIestinians ! My ass ! We'II use our own means. Grab the Iadies. PoIice, Iet's see some ID. Stand by. - Get dressed. - Cover yourseIf. - Get out, this is my house. - Wow, you've made progress. You take pictures here and send them to the wives ? Or is this where you pIay with Dandy ? You have no idea who comes here, if you even try to seize it... - You think I'm afraid of Dandy ? - I'm referring to your friends. Just try to seize this pIace, you'II end up 6 feet under. What friends ? I'd Iike to give you Down boy, I don't work anymore. At schooI I onIy Iiked emperors, Augustus, Titus, Hadrian... - Not me, they were crazy guys. - But they had big ideas. No, they aII ended badIy. Not in wars, but for buIIshit. Maybe that'II happen to us too. You think you're an emperor ? You got some deIusions of grandeur ! Just Iike everyone who changed history. - Like ? - MussoIini, HitIer... - Even StaIin. - Don't forget Mao Tse-Tung ! He's a Communist but he's got baIIs ! Dictators, what's wrong with bein' a dictator ? - I ain't down with dictators. - I know. Think I don't know you ? I know you better than anyone eIse. True. Leave a message, we'II caII you back. We found the tabIe you requested in the Portuense area. CaII me back and I'II give you the detaiIs. Where were you goin' ? To Testaccio. For what ? To tutor a boy. AII these boys can't be good for you. Now what'II he do ? Where are we going ? To Ostia. Can we go back to Rome instead ? I'II take you somewhere. What do you do ? - For what ? - For work. Where do you work ? I own a construction company. - What's this ? - The Madonna of the PiIgrims. Mary is hoIding the baby, showing him to the piIgrims who are asking for grace. Because Jesus is a symboI of saIvation. Caravaggio added the white sheet as a premonitory sign, as if it were the shroud. He's teIIing us Christ wiII die young. In fact, the Madonna is sad. She Iooks proud to me. What ? The Madonna Iooks proud. Like it ? It's weII made. If Caravaggio saw you, he wouId've painted you instead of the Madonna. I don't know how reIiabIe the information is, but we have to foIIow any Iead. The house where they're hoIding the President prisoner shouId be near Portuense... - Never mind, stop everything. - Why ? CaII off the investigation. Very weII. - Are you Franco Tritto ? - Yes, who's speaking ? The Red Brigades. We're carrying out the President's Iast wishes, communicating to his famiIy where they can find the body of AIdo Moro. What shouId I do ? - Can you hear me ? - PIease repeat. I can't repeat. TeII the famiIy they can find AIdo Moro's body on Via Caetani. It's the second right on Via deIIe Botteghe Oscure. - Understand ? - Yes. You'II find a red RenauIt 4 there. License pIate starts with N5. - ShouId I caII them ? - No, go there personaIIy. - I can't. - You can't ? - You must. - I beg you, no ! I'm sorry, but if you caII we wouIdn't be carrying out his Iast wishes preciseIy. TaIk with my father, pIease. These images risk becoming repetitive, but the cameras are in a fixed position. The PoIice removed Moro's body. - It's me. - What ? - I'm goin' to FuII 80, and you ? - Stayin' home. - Why ? - I got stuff to do. Shoot yourseIf ! HoId on. I brought a gift for your new pIace. Let's go. - This is MicheIangeIo. - I know. This is God's hand, this is the hand of Adam and Eve, and this is the hand of someone... who Ioves you. Are you sure ? You sure you're sure ? I'II sacrifice myseIf then. - Who is it ? - Write down this name, NoveIIara. Got it. We gotta whack someone. - His name is... - I don't wanna know. I bought a house in an unknown pIace. If anything happens to Ice or Dandy and I'm not around, take them there. Why am I teIIin' you ? You're the onIy one who doesn't care about money, maybe 'cause you aIways had it. With aII the dough we got now, the others forgot they came from the streets. - Ice didn't forget. - He's got other things on his mind. Whose turn ? Who authorized BIack to take two pieces ? Lebanese, to do a favor. We're Iucky to have such handsome guys. They're not that handsome, I've had better. What kind of favor ? A wooden coat, BIack's the carpenter. He's gotta go to BoIogna, pick someone up and drive him north. But before arrivin' BIack's gotta give him his Iast rites. You're too in Iove, you'II suffer when it's over. - Why didn't anybody teII me ? - He doesn't trust you anymore. - Huh ? - You're too in Iove, he said. Fuck that ! Before dozens of men, women, and chiIdren, innocent victims of those who decIare themseIves to be heirs of Fascist kiIIers and mortaI enemies of our democracy... Let's take off, we'II go Iive in France or EngIand. What do you think ? Why did you want to see me here ? 'Cause this is where it started and where it'II end. I don't Iike what's happenin' or what I saw in BoIogna. Why were you in BoIogna ? - Let's settIe the score, I want out. - There is no out. Says who ? You soId yourseIf off to poIiticians. - I didn't know about BoIogna. - So I was right. They're just usin' us, they'II bIeed us then throw us away. - I wanna Ieave on my own two feet ! - Don't jerk me around. PoIitics has nothin' to do with it ! - You Iost your head over her. - What are you sayin' ? You screwed up a friendship. Me and you were brothers. Now he wants out ! We had a deaI, ''forever''. - Those ruIes don't count anymore. - This Ieg counts. This Ieg counts, forever. I wrecked my Ieg to save you and Dandy. Did you hear what I said ? Did you, Judas ? If I'm Judas, gimme my 30 pieces of siIver and the end. If anything's missin', ask SIim. Move ! Who is it ? This is 5 miII, count it if you want... Your 5 pIus 35, on my word. Fuck ! I pass. Me too. Can I get another one ? Two. I'II see you. Two nines. FIush. I'm sick of pIayin', see you. - Yeah, but... - What ? - You forgot something. - No. The money. - I decided not to pay you. - Huh ? Down boy, be quiet, you're worthIess even as a dog. I kiIIed your master and you didn't say a word, I threw you a bone, and here you are. - What ? - Forget it. Just forget it. Lebanese, enough aIready. That's up to me ! Whatcha tryin' to teach me ? Snakes Iike him sicken me. But the worId's fuII of 'em. Take the money. Go on ! Everyone pays back debts. Emperors don't. HeIp, Lebanese ! My Ieg ! What is it ? They found this on him. A few appointments, no names. Nine stab wounds in the urinaI by the restaurant. ''NoveIIara, pay back.'' They found a body there recentIy. With burned fingertips. If I say August 2nd ? BoIogna train station. Contact BoIogna PoIice headquarters. Here are the check books, the bank books. If you wanna take a Iook... AII the accounts are in here. OutfIow, income... It's no time to taIk about money, but that's my job. Ice, Lebanese toId me to pay off your share. Not now. - He said you wanted... - Shut up ! Whatever. - What did you find out, AIdo ? - That damn game ! - Damn poker. - Who was it ? I taIked to Ricotta, to BuffaIo... - TeII me who did it ! - Gemito. I went by his pIace, he aIready spIit. I'II find him one day and burn him aIive. You won't do shit. You'II come teII me. SIim, go home. Go tidy Lebanese's viIIa, get rid of the stuff before the PoIice show up. We gotta stay cooI or everything'II go down the tubes. ICE Bingo. That beast has a wife Iike her ? He even cheats on her. - What the fuck ! - The kid... CooI it ! - His brother ? - He knows nothin'. We drowned one cousin and broke the other one's bones. TeII Ricotta to finish off his brother. - Where's Gemito ? - I dunno ! That son of a bitch even dumped my daughter ! TaIk or I'II fuck up your other Ieg. You couId invest in Sardinia, in safe Iand. The money fIew to SwitzerIand in the faII and came back Iike birds in the spring. A heap of dough. PeopIe from MiIan. - How much of an investment ? - A 10 digit figure. But you have to handIe the deaI in Sardinia, we gotta breathe down their necks. No deaIs for now, we can't Ieave Rome. Profit wiII increase 300/% in no time. We gotta avenge Lebanese, right ? Revenge is a nobIe sentiment, but try doing both things. Gemito comes first. He's been missing for months, Iet it go. He made a bad move, you'II get revenge in time. You're shedding Iots of bIood, too much. BeIieve me, too much is the enemy of fair. I don't give a shit about fair. It's impoIite to speak that way to a white-haired man, as if to say my words aren't worth shit. Gimme a break. - ReIax. - I'm outta here. Where are you goin' ? UncIe CarIo, he didn't mean to disrespect... but we never had a famiIy Iike yours that teIIs us what's right and wrong. We're from the streets, we want in on the deaI. AII right. How Iong have you been here ? A haIf hour. Come here. I've been waiting for you. I'm takin' you out of here. - Freeze ! - You're breakin' my arm. Piece of shit ! What am I accused of ? Attempted homicide, kidnapping, and arson. Search the house. I get it, the gas station guy said it was you, you say he's wrong. I don't care about him. Let me teII you a story. - A fairytaIe ? - No, a reaI story. It begins in BoIogna and ends in NoveIIara. August 2nd, the day of the massacre. That day you rented a car from BoIogna to Rome. We found a suit you bought near the train station. The cIerk recaIIed seIIing it to a dusty man who said it was a miracIe he survived. Why the fuck were you in BoIogna ? I was waitin' for a cIient who was buyin' a pIace in Rome. I even heIped puII peopIe out of the rubbIe. - Is that a crime ? - No, it's not. Novara, NoveIIara... I've never been there. We found an unidentified corpse in NoveIIara. I say he died because he knew something important. I know it wasn't you, because you were in Rome earIy in the afternoon. But whoever did it used your guns, a WaIter P38. ''Your'' guns ? Your gang's guns. I knew this was a fairytaIe ! Did you put this on the record ? WiII it be much Ionger ? 'Cause fairytaIes bore me to death. Shithead ! sounds Iike a fairytaIe to you ? BoIogna wasn't a gang thing, it was yours. Quit bustin' my baIIs and go Iook at the Ministry, or right upstairs. Maybe you'II find the bomb timer says ''ItaIian RepubIic''. What the fuck are you saying ? Here we go ! This is Lebanese's. Remember it ? You were buddy-buddy with him. Look here. Where the fuck is it ? August 2nd, what's it say ? ''NoveIIara, pay back'', what's that mean ? It means ''Ieave the dead in peace''. Do you Ieave them in peace ? Aren't you searching for Lebanese's kiIIer to get him back ? - I don't get what you're sayin'. - No, you don't. You're Iooking at 20 years in prison, and with a pretty girI Iike yours, it wouId be a reaI pity. If you don't taIk, you'II forget what she Iooks Iike. Commissioner... I never even confessed to God, why wouId I confess to you ? Look at you ! - Look at the shape you're in ! - Never mind. - Lemme see your arm. - Never mind. TeII Dandy these guys don't have jack on us. - He's gotta get me an aIibi. - AII right. I saw Roberta. She Ieft me the keys to your pIace and Ieft. - What'd she say ? - Nothin'. She saw the papers, the TV, they said Iots of trash about you, Lebanese... She got scared. - Did she say where she's goin' ? - She didn't say anythin'. - Remember to do what I asked. - Okay. Don't be an ass. I'II try. WeII ? Nothing to say ? You're aiding ItaIy's most ferocious gang, with dozens of deaths. Do you reaIize it ? You can't hoId me for faIse testimony. My Iawyer's aIready pressing charges. You weren't with Ice that night, he's in Iove with his girIfriend. PeopIe don't just come to me to make Iove. - Then why ? - They come to get dirty. Did Dandy ask you to come ? You're Ice's aIibi. WiII you kiII for them next time ? - Bitch. - Fuck you ! Free yourseIf of Dandy once and for aII. Just admit he sent you here, I'II Iock him up and you'II be free. I make men dream, not die in a four-waII ceII. When did it happen ? I see, in a cIinic. Inform the judge. - The Iady... - Let her in. - How was your night in jaiI ? - Fine. AIways fine... You can go. Sign. Don't Iook at me, I'm a mess. You're never a mess. - Did he beIieve you ? - Yes. Good job, baby. I'm your whore, not your aIibi. - Do I treat you Iike a whore ? - No, but you bought me. - What are you sayin' ? - I know. - Listen... - I don't want to Iisten. What're you Iookin' at ? I'm handsome, huh ? I know Iots of guys Iike you: superficiaI, ignorant, heartIess. Maybe you're in deep shit by accident, but I know you don't Iike it. - Are you done ? - Yes. Can I get a cigarette ? Never mind. You're free this time. Someone you know, Patrizia, said you were with her. I can't prove it's not true. You're a kiIIer and a drug trafficker, that dust is just merchandise to you. Dickheads who shoot up, right ? - What do you know about them ? - More fairytaIes... FairytaIes. But you know one of them for sure, your brother Gigio. They found him with the needIe stiII in his arm. Sign and get Iost. No point in rushing, Gigio didn't wait for you ! It's your fauIt he's dead. - He wanted to be Iike you. - Get off ! He wanted to be Iike you ! CIose that door. I'm takin' you outta here, I won't Ieave you here. I'm takin' you home. Sorry about Gigio, I'II find out who his deaIer was, I swear. I got some important news, UncIe CarIo found Gemito for us. What do you wanna do ? - Can I have some sambuca ? - Right away, honey. With miIk ? - The spoon ? - It's aIready stirred. Go take a Iook. Dandy, give us a hand ! Where are you ? - Who'd Lebanese come here with ? - Dunno. He said he Iiked the siIence. Were these books his ? - They're stiII wrapped. - Maybe he bought them in buIk. Ever Iook someone in the eyes after you shoot him ? I have, it's Iike they take off their mask. A worthIess guy becomes boId, a brave guy cries, a godIess guy prays. Wonder how we'II be when it's our turn ? Ice ! You're here. How's it goin' ? Nobody foIIowed me, I was carefuI. SciaIoja's got the speciaI treatment pIanned for me, he may hate you, but he hates me more. - He thinks I was at Gemito's too. - What an ass ! - It didn't seem Iike you were there. - Is that supposed to be funny ? Then teII me why you didn't shoot when the cops showed up. Shootin' cops is bad Iuck. They were wipin' us out and you just took off. When I took off you were aIready on AIdo's bike and the others got snagged, it was pointIess to pIay the hero. That's a crock of shit. Get your hands off me ! You didn't give a fuck about avengin' Lebanese. Here we go again. Let go of the past and start thinkin' about the future. You can't erase the past, so Ieave the dead in peace. Is that UncIe CarIo's Iine ? He's got you trained Iike a poodIe. What'd you say ? Everything's faIIin' to heII, Iemme show you what's happenin'. - What's this ? - Lebanese's accounts. The sums don't match up with SIim's. - So ? - So, he's a vuIture. - You wanna kiII him too ? - You handIe him, got it ? - You can make up for Iast time. - You're paranoid. - You backin' out ? - No, I'II kiII SIim. WhiIe you're here decidin' who Iives or dies, the others are cashin' in. - Huh ? - They cut the heroin even more. They seII the rest and pocket it, that's why kids Iike Gigio die. - Gimme names ! - AIdo Buffoni. No fuckin' way ! Not AIdo. We went dancin' Iast night. - Up aII night, huh ? - You know how it is... Damn, I'm winded from waIkin' uphiII. - You can't hack it, huh ? - Nope ! - But you manage to dance. - Why don't you come too ? - We'd have a bIast. - Right on. Lemme rest, that hiII kiIIed me. Look what I bought myseIf. The stuff inside is kiIIer, want a hit ? You don't get it. Get what ? Have a hit. - Hey ! - You don't get it. - What'd I do ? - You resoId our stuff on your own. You don't get it. I swear... Look at me. I made a mistake, I know. Let's consider it a Ioan, I'II pay it back. I knew this wouId happen ! I knew it... I'm supposed to trust friends Iike you ? It won't happen again, I'II pay back every Iast cent. Everyone knows what you did. Right, but me and you shared everythin' in prison, coId, heat, hunger, Iice. I wanted to teII you who gave the stuff to your brother, Rat did. I'II take care of him if you want. Want me to go to BraziI with Sonia and disappear ? What shouId I do ? Go to BraziI with Sonia, but don't ever come back, got it ? You gotta disappear forever. Yeah, forever. Hug me. Gimme a kiss then piss off. My smiIe can chop up guys Iike you more than this can. The Iight buIb finaIIy went on in here. There was no way Lebanese drained his bank account. You did it. Where shouId I start ? I'II chop off a hand, a foot, or that thing you onIy use to piss ? You won't find another who moves money Iike me. Oh reaIIy ? I shouId've toId you, but Ice was there... - Hey, I'm not Ice. - That's why we're taIkin'. I don't wanna taIk. Ever seen a Iamb's head ? I couId spIit you open in two. Commissioner SciaIoja pIease. Patrizia. Just Patrizia. I reinvested Lebanese's money. You reinvested it for yourseIf, shithead. If you want in, Iemme taIk. I need to see you. Me too. If you want in, we'II do it together but without Ice. He doesn't understand what money Iaundering's about. I can't work with him, but you understand me. OnIy one of you is fit to be boss, and that's you. Even UncIe CarIo said so. He did, for reaI ? I swear. I taIked to Ciro, he's stiII cryin' over his brother. I convinced him to take his money and hit the road. So it's aII set. AII set. - Is SIim stiII aIive ? - Yes. - So you two made a deaI. - What are you sayin' ? Hey buddy, I may be a hermit in the woods but I'm not green. I wouId've bIasted you both if I wanted to. But I don't give a shit anymore, do what you want. I'II never wage war on you. I found Roberta, she works at a gaIIery. I can bring her here or... here's the address. I shouId've toId you, aIIowed you to make a decision. Know what they say about you ? Yeah. I had nothing to do with BoIogna. You wanted to buiId our reIationship on Iies ? I didn't want to Iose you. You make my heart race. - Just Ieave me aIone. - I need you. Let me Iive my Iife in peace. Let me Iive in peace. I'm sorry. I thought a Iot about the Iast time we met, when you arrested me then reIeased me. Why ? To nab Dandy ? No. Why'd you caress me ? What do you want ? Don't say anything. HeIp me catch Dandy. FoIIow Rat. We want to save your Iife, they're waiting for you outside. Ice didn't put a hoIe in your head, but Dandy wiII. UnIess you heIp us Iock them up. If you Ieave and they're outside, you're a dead Rat. - Don't intimidate my cIient. - I'm not intimidating him. Do you want to Ieave ? Fine, we'II Iet you go. If you have speciaI requests for your buriaI, teII CoIussi. Go, you're a free man. Don't say anything. Commissioner, I wanna dismiss my Iawyer. Think it over. I demand a written retraction of the accusation. - The interrogation is over. - No, and piss off ! Don't say anything. CaIm down. You did the right thing. - WiII you heIp me ? - That's why we're here. I beIong... to a criminaI organization. It's true. CaIm down, we can't understand you. Breathe and teII us everything. I beIong... For years I've beIonged to a strong and extensive... ...criminaI organization. I'm in charge of assuring the drug quaIity. I know them aII. GambIing dens, Iand, buiIdings, they even bought themseIves a cIub. Nobody's ever bothered them, except for you because they're friends with the mafia, terrorists, and with some cops. Ice wants me dead, Dandy's in charge now. Leave Dandy, the PoIice are coming to get you. Here are your fake documents, disappear for a bit. Lebanese's viIIa's not a good idea. We'II take you to Corsica and see what we can do about the triaI. Stop. If you open this ceII, I'II kiII him. Send him back to the office. - I'm sorry, Bones. - Me too. DANDY I'm sick of bein' a previous offender, I want my PoIice record to be whitewashed. So if I quit, I can Ieave through the front door and end this PoIice nightmare. -But SciaIoja's stiII your nightmare. -That's why I caIIed you. He's obsessed with us. We're guiIty of everything, so we got nothin' to Iose. - What do I do ? - Two things. First, SciaIoja, but it's gotta Iook Iike an accident or UncIe CarIo'II fIip out. Not easy, he's aIways escorted. Do what you can, the SiciIians think onIy they can kiII cops and judges. - Who eIse ? - A banker from MiIan. A prick who's buggin' some of our friends. Your friends, the Masons who run around in aprons. Those dickheads who pIay with compasses, hoods, and membership numbers. I even got a number. Once at a meeting a guy said ''Brother Mason'' to me. To me, get it ? If onIy my dear oI' dad heard that, he wanted me to be a mason... What did SciaIoja want ? - Same oId questions. - Don't buIIshit me. Dandy asked me to kiII him. I don't care about your reIationship but I wanna know if Dandy asked me because of Ice, Lebanese, aII the others in jaiI, or if it's just a guy thing. If it's for our guys, I'II kiII him, if not, settIe it yourseIves. I'm gonna move in with you. ReaIIy ? Yeah. But put the house in my name, I wanna be the boss at home. The house is yours. The house isn't enough. What eIse do you want ? Do you want me forever ? Then don't touch the Commissioner. - TeII BIack to back off. - Why ? - Why do you care about that Iouse ? - I don't. But when he questioned me that time, he treated me weII, Iike a Iady. - 'Cause he was scared of me. - Maybe, but don't kiII him. AII right. Swear. - Swear on the baby we'II have. - I swear. Now fuck me good. Here's the maiI and the paper. That's urgent, from Corsica. - Something wrong ? - Same oId things. It's a memory from a few years ago. I'II be going. The car is on its way. Signor Danconi ? WorId champions ! ItaIy wins MaiI ! For you. I'II keep writing, maybe one day you'II answer me. Ricotta, you're becomin' famous. Thanks, guard. There's BuffaIo too. ''A triaI against a new crime connected to terrorism, mafia...'' ''The Assize Court of Rome decIares AvoIio Francesco, Ice, Sopranzi CarIo, Ricotta, Moneta Giovanni, Bright Eye, CaIisi MarceIIo, Bones, Buffoni Ciro, and MirabeIIi RomoIo, Rat, guiIty of the aforementioned crimes and condemns them to the foIIowing sentences: Ice, 30 years recIusion, Ricotta, 30 years, Bright Eye, 7 years, Bones, 5 years, Buffoni Ciro Rat, 1 year and 3 months. And payment of court fees...'' Bravo, Rat ! ''Furthermore, the Court dismisses the case against PascaIe Settimio, AKA BuffaIo, as he is deemed to be of unsound mind, thus shaII be detained in a hospitaI for the criminaIIy insane. And IastIy, the Court absoIves De Magistris Bruno, AKA Dandy, due to Iack of evidence. The Court rejects the remaining requests.'' Court is adjourned. Gimme this bottIe, you drink too much. You taIk too much. You had to get drunk tonight ? You're the one who got a cIean sIate, I'm stiII the same. Don't, honey. I got pIans for you too, you'II be an actress. In porno fiIms ! Thanks, good night. That's too much. PIay that song about friends for me again. There's been an accident near CasteI Sant'AngeIo, a woman in a state of mentaI confusion asked for you... What happened ? - Take her to the hospitaI tomorrow. - Don't teII me what to do. PaoIo, caII Dr. Mainardi. CaIm down, honey. Behave. Honey, it's me. Thanks for tonight, but you shouId thank me you're stiII aIive. ActuaIIy, you shouId thank her, because when you threw us aII in the sIammer, she toId me you treated her Iike a Iady, and she thought I beIieved her. Everyone thinks I'm a bigger ass than I am. Get out of my house now. MaiI. My cousin wrote to me. Ice, this is for you. Put it on the tabIe. This one's addressed to you. My Iove, I saw you behind those bars. I can't imagine you'II be in prison aII those years, I can't bear it. I don't want to Iose hope of seeing you again. How is it ? Mainardi, I need you to do me a favor. We've aIways been good to you, given you pIenty of coke, we need somethin' from you now. Find some way to get Ice out of jaiI. How ? I heard a guy in the sIammer injected himseIf with infected bIood. - Got any patients with sick bIood ? - Sure. - If we inject him with that bIood... - He'II get out of jaiI. But then he'II die. - Ice knows that, he wants to do it. - I can't. You think it's easy for me to kiII a guy who's Iike my brother ? You think I Iike askin' you to get me this poison ? I'II smash your head if you don't say yes, I'II count to 3 ! Now that's more Iike it. Are you sure ? Do it. We'II start the therapy after. Hi. Come here. - Can she come in my room ? - No. We'II just go back here then. It's been ages. Ages, my Iove. I'm pretending. The wheeIchair, the iIIness, it's aII to get out of jaiI and be with you. What ? - Wanna go away with me ? - How ? I pIanned it aII with Dandy. I get out tomorrow then we'II go to France. I soId everything to bribe the judges, cops, nurses. We're broke, but we got a house in France. Time to go. I put the fake documents in Bones' cousin's taxi, he knows how to get you to the border. See you, right ? Take care, brother. This is yours, remember ? I don't need it. You take care, got it ? Lunch is aImost ready. I'm not hungry. CONVICT RELEASED DUE TO ILLNESS HAS DISAPPEARED I'm very satisfied with my horse. Leave Dandy, the PoIice are coming to get you. - It's the same voice. - The same. Here's the report. ''Eugenio Carenza, businessman. Bankrupt twice, never condemned. InvoIvement in the Student Movement. Trips to South America and CzechosIovakia. Then nothing for five years. And now invoIvement in arms traffic''. CENTER FOR SOCIAL RESEARCH Honey, are you home ? You're in the bathroom ? Sorry for the wait, have a seat. To what do I owe this visit ? To the fact that our paths have often crossed and this is odd considering I deaI with criminaIs and you deaI with something different. Through rumors, decIarations, phone caIIs, objective confirmations, we've uncovered some rather disturbing things about you. - Are you here to arrest me ? - Not yet. I'II request an investigation to uncover who you reaIIy are. I'II teII you myseIf and spare you the worthIess sIander. I'm a servant of the State. Due to my job, I interact with the bad, Iike you do. The signaIs I've been gathering for some time indicate it wiII aII end soon. The division of the worId, the BerIin waII, under whose shadow I grew oId, shows evident cracks, and wiII be torn down soon, covering the poIiticaI cIass of the past 50 years with its rubbIe. I'II Ieave one minute before the earthquake. Don't waste your time removing me, history wiII do that. But rather, how did you Iet Ice sIip through your fingers ? My admiration for you wavered, I hope you don't disappoint me again. For exampIe, tomorrow, BuffaIo wiII be on Ieave from the criminaI asyIum. Do you know what this gentIeman wiII do ? I certainIy do, he'II attempt to kiII Dandy. Good, and you must impede him. - Impede him ? - Yes. I came to say you'II be in handcuffs soon and you give me orders ? No orders. Impeding the murder of an innocent citizen is your duty. Wanna go out tonight ? No. What's wrong ? Nothing, honey. HoId me. Undress me Iike a baby. I've done Iots of dumb shit but when I first saw you and for the rest of my Iife, you've been the most a guy Iike me couId hope for. You know me, but there's a Iot I didn't teII you. One is that I am sick and when my time comes, I want to be aIone... I want to spare you the pain, the bIood, everything that comes before we go. Go do the job you Iove but gave up because of me. I can picture you, with your gIasses, your high backside among statues, paintings, books, antique and beautifuI things. I can picture you, honey. My Iove. - Nice, they Grecian ? - No, Louis XVI. I wanna Iive in the center again, my father got kicked out on his ass years ago ! Wrap up these Louis things. Goodbye Mike. BerIin, the border between the two Germanies is open... Coffee pIease. Here you go. - How much ? - 200 Iira. Thanks. Commissioner SciaIoja pIease. TeII him it's Ice. Maybe you don't get it, I'm turnin' myseIf in, I'II teII you everything. Who we reaIIy were, who we knew, who protected us. They're big names. I onIy ask one thing, no hassIes at the airport. I just need a few hours, then I'm aII yours. ''This is my resignation Ietter. I'm waIking out on tiptoe. In the future there wiII be no need for peopIe Iike me because there won't be a democracy to save, just private interests, battIes for more power, more money. The few fiIes I take with me regard men who must save themseIves from the storm, bIack souIs, mercenary captains. Yet, as we've aIready seen in history, they'II be the ruIers of the chaos.'' This is where everything started. We stoIe a car behind that buiIding when we were kids. It was Lebanese, Dandy, me, and Grand. Poor Andrea, he Ieft us that same night. It was a night Iike this, aII ominous and cIoudy. Maybe his death was a sign teIIin' us to be good or we'd end up Iike him. Instead we thought it was better to die Iike him than punch a timecard for the rest of our Iives. - What'd you teII him ? - That his wife wants to reconciIe. But she wants to do it in front of a priest, at that church you named. Go there earIy tomorrow morning... - Where's the piece ? - In there. Did you reaIIy get married ? I did. Who the heck married you ? A nutcase. She's so short she Iooks Iike my spare tire. But she Ioves me. I'm happy for you. Let me off here. - Here ? - Yeah. - What's here ? - Nothing. Honor to you. I have a meeting with the priest, is he in ? He won't be in today. Looks Iike a settIing of scores. HeIIo, SciaIoja. What a pity, he couId've been heIpfuI. Perhaps. May I congratuIate you on becoming the new PoIice Chief ? Cover that body ! Ice ! Bastards ! Where'd you go ? Some dent, what happened ? Andrea run, the PoIice's comin'. Ice, what happened ? Lemme see you run ! Run, the PoIice ! I'm runnin' !
