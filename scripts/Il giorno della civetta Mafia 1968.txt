Stop immediately! - What's going on? - Open up! - Why have we stopped? - I told you to open up! - The door's stuck! - There's a dead man. - Dead? Who's dead? - I don't know him. - I think I know him from somewhere. Really? Why didn't you stop after seeing that dead man'? - I didn't see him. - Not true, liar! You slowed down! - No, I didn't - Go to hell. The truck is from the building site. - But there's blood there... - Pass me a blanket or a cloth. - Here you go, Sergeant. - At the next slop, call the Marshal in town. Tell him that Salvatore Colasberna was shot near Fiore. Is that clear? So, go on! Get on board! Quickly! I knew that he'd end up like that. Some people are dead, even when they're alive. He said he could live without friends. And now look at him. - Who's living in that house? - Someone called Nicolosi. He's not at home. He went to work early in the morning. I spoke to his wife. She said that she didn't hear the gunshots. Didn't hear anyone, didn't see anyone, doesn't know anybody, doesn't go anywhere. - Hello? Wolf, calling Wolf. - Roger, Wolf speaking. Tell me, Marshal. - Give me the Captain. - Right a way, Marshal. - When did you find him? - At 7:15. Here in Sicily men kill each other before sunrise, to get a good start. They only killed one in the afternoon: Pistilli, the public notary. But he used to sleep until late. Roger! Captain, they've killed Salvatore Colasberna near Fiore. - Colasberna? The one from the construction firm? - Yes, the owner. Any idea of the motive yet, Marshal? Perhaps because of the new road'? It's created a lot of interest recently. Here's La Stella's building firm. La Stella is that fat slob who drinks 2 lot. It's him that built those farmhouses on marshland. The house that was smashed by a cow was built by his firm. He held a meeting with all the foremen and said that... I know, he said 'Whoever builds houses with concrete instead of sand and cowpat is a fool'. - Or a cop! - No, no, a fool. It's very important not to seem a fool. A fool is almost as bad as being a cuckold - but a cuckold is the worst of all. - They're like flies on a corpse. - They won't find a thing... That's Pizzuco, he has a cousin in parliament. And a criminal record as long as the road he's building. - He has a lot of power around here! - A respected man, eh? - Exactly that, Captain! - And where was he yesterday morning at six? At home. Sleeping, like all the others: Pizzuco, La Stella, Lancia, Colosimo... All people who 'made it'... respectable citizens who don't kill anymore. Perhaps they'll order a hit... and pay. Not a lot, but they pay. Stop... look who's walking around here: Rosa Nicolosi. She's the woman who lives near the scene of the crime. - What are you doing here, Rosa Nicolosi? - I was picking some chicory and cabbages. And with so much land around, why right here? Why come and look for chicory and cabbages right here? And why not? Am I doing something wrong? The chicory doesn't belong to anyone, it's just chicory. Everything belongs to someone even the chicory. Come on, get in the car. We'll take you to your house. Don'! be afraid - we're not taking you to the barracks! Well? He's talking to you! Move it! Come on, get moving. The shots must have come from there, just after the bend. From there, Colasberna was wounded, and the truck... probably went on another hundred meters up to where the jeep is. That's where the killer caught up with Colasberna - and it was all over. From there, someone must have seen or at least heard the shots. - And where does your husband work? - Wherever he can. - Does he work every day? - No. Only when he's lucky. - What time does he leave the house in the morning? - I don'! know... it depends. - And what time does he get back in the evening? - He doesn't have a timetable. And this morning? What time did he leave? Look Rosa, you don'! have to be afraid. I'm not accusing your husband. If he wanted to kill someone, he wouldn't do it in from of his house. It's perhaps a little obvious! I'm only looking for information. Come on, give me a hand? Excuse me... but where are you from? - I'm from Parma. - Near Milan? - Yes, near Milan. - And they don'! kill anyone there? Sure they do! But in a different way. And do the people there testify... without fear'? No, it's the same for us loo. Tight-lipped as usual... but not from fear. It's because the people don't want any nuisance, or to waste time with the trial. We've got plenty of time here. And plenty of chicory loo! Why did you go looking for it near the building site? Because it's better there! Chicory is chicory, cabbage is cabbage - it grows everywhere! Did you see your husband last night? Did you hear him come back? So he might not have come back at all? So then, say it: "He didn't come back" Say it: "He left yesterday morning and didn't return" Sometimes he doesn't come back. OK, so let's say he didn't return. Why didn't he come back? Well, I'll tell you. Because he doesn't want to be interrogated. Because he doesn't want to talk. Because he doesn't want to be implicated. OK... Please, when he returns, tell him to come to the station. Or at least he can call us. It's just a formality. Dominici! Come on, let's go! This is Colasberna's building site. They're off for the funeral. Was Colasberna friends with the others: Pizzuco, Lancia, La Stella? No, just a hello and a goodbye. Colasberna was the reserved type. He only got along with his brothers. He was a decent, honest worker. You can'! steal money from the government by yourself... and he didn't agree with it. Understand? He also had a police record though. I questioned some of the truck drivers that are always on this road. No-one saw or heard anything. A population of the blind and deaf, but when they shoot - then they can see! Boy can they see! Hey! Why are you still using bags? Isn't it better to use tankers, like they are? - We can't rent the tankers. - And why is that? - We just simply can't... - Have you had some trouble? They threw an excavator down into a ravine, but they didn't press charges, true? What type of sentence did Colasberna get? Six months in confinement for Anti-Fascism when he was 25. - But that isn't a criminal of fence. - Sorry, but according to the law it is. Then it should also apply to the President of the Republic too. OK. Write down what I dictate to you. Salvatore Colasberna was killed, because he dared to win, against a friend of the friends, "the call for tenders for the construction of the new road, and he didn't want to share this with anyone. Signed: 'A friend. No, thank you. I don't smoke. - So, he was killed for this? - We know nothing about it. How's that? You just put it in an anonymous letter to me! You both look turns to write one word each. It's a bit of a primitive system, but thanks all the same. But we didn't write anything, Captain. OK... but in order to continue, I have to know more. And what should we tell you? Take a look at this lovely map. There are many flags - black, red and green. The black flags are for unsolved murders, red for the ones we're still investigating, and green for the cases which have been resolved and punished. There still aren't many of those...! The murder of your brother has a red ag. It's up to you to turn it green. - So? - I see a lot more of the black flags, Captain. You're saying that you won't talk because the killers are still on the loose, but the killers are on the loose because you won'! talk! And now we're back at the start again! Fine... Your letter will remain anonymous; I don'! want you living in fear. You can go. - Our respects, Captain. - Good day. Rosa Nicolosi. Captain, it's Rosa Nicolosi. Come in, come in. Come on in, Rosa. Have a seal. Don't worry, nobody can see you. Aren't you going to ask me anything? I didn't summon you. I have nothing to ask you. He didn't come back... You said that sometimes he doesn't return... You weren't worried then... so why are you worried now? It's been four days. OK. Marshal, let's get someone to look for this Nicolosi. Yes, sir. But where should we look? Far away, or here nearby? - Has anyone threatened you? - My husband has a clean record. I know, I know... but it's difficult to look for a needle in a haystack, and your husband, in Sicily... is like a needle. Maybe at this moment your husband needs help...? A lot of help. And what's his wife doing? She's silent. Doesn't want to help. - Just what kind of wife is she? - I'd give my blood for him. The other morning near your house there were four rifle shots. Where was your husband when they were fired? Now then Rosa, we're all alone. No-one can see us. We won't write anything down. So then, where was your husband? - He left early... at five. - In the dark? - Yes. - Did you hear the shots? - Yes, I did. - Did you take a look outside? No, I thought that it was just a hunter. - But it's not the hunting season. - And how should I know...? - Where did your husband go? - To look for work. - At the building sites? - Maybe... So when we saw you that morning on the road you were looking for him? - No... I was looking for... - Chicory and cabbages... Well, perhaps he disappeared for another reason? And if so Rosa, maybe sometime you'll tell me, OK'? - It appears that she has a lover. - Says who? Don Ciccio the barber - he told Corporal Torres. Seems everyone knows about it. If you'll excuse me, I have to go. My daughter's alone at home. Very well. - Captain, promise me you'll look for him? - We'll look for him. God bless you. - And who is this lover? - Well, they didn't say, but it's clear it's not Rosa's first time. So, it's a woman they gossip about. What else do you know? They also say that her head is full of strange ideas. One time she left home to go to Palermo to be a shop assistant. Well, I'd hardly call that a scandal. It's a job like any other. Sure. But such a beautiful woman must be unhappy to be the wife of an idler. - So why did she marry him? - She got pregnant at 16 years old. - I understand... - And where's she going? To Don Mariano Arena. A wealthy man... he has a daughter studying in Switzerland and a fat bank account. A high-flyer who's made it big. A woman's here; she's saying she wants to speak to you. She's in the from room. My respects... - Who are you'? - Rosa Nicolosi, Tano Nicolosi's wife. And what do you want from me? Sorry, but my husband hasn't been back home for four days. And you've come to look for him here? No, I was just thinking that if you wanted, you could help me to find him? Why not go to the Carabinieri? They're the ones who look for missing people. I've already been to the Carabinieri. You did good. It's your duty. I told them that my husband hadn't returned... nothing else. I didn't tell them what I could have. I didn't name anyone. And what can I do? If I see your husband, I'll tell him not to make you worry. We've always voted like you wanted us to. Good. Santuzza! Come here, Rosa. Give something to this good woman, she has a young girl. Give her one of our hens, OK? Wait, Rosa. Ah, give it here! Here. Eat it tomorrow, OK? Wait, I'll give you some jars of marmalade loo. Take these. - Now, go back home and don't worry, OK? - God bless you. Beautiful woman. All beautiful- the hips... the breasts... It's odd... that just today Don Ciccio the barber wants us to know... that Nicolosi had a lover. Don't you believe him? Look, I'm not exactly left enchanted by Rosa Nicolosi's ways... Maybe she's a liar, or just very cunning. But what I'd like to know is if they're going... to start playing tricks to try and change the motive of the crime. Which is? What can you find very cheap here in Sicily? What thing can be found at the street corners or on the stalls? - I don't know. - Honour. Honour, Marshal! It's the answer to it all. We must look for Nicolosi at once, and pull those horns off of his head! - Very well. - Marshal, you have a son studying engineering, right'? - Yes, why? What's happened? - Are you afraid of the Carabinieri too? - No! That would be the last straw! Excuse me, but have you taken exams in construction? - Of course! - He got the highest marks! I want to prove that everyone around here stole, except for Colasberna. That is - poor construction and falsified technical data. You'll need a civil engineer, an expert. I'm only a student. If I wait for the court to appoint an expert... the investigation will also be at a standstill for a year. If the State mechanism isn't working, it's not the fault of me or my generation. Captain, my son didn't follow in my footsteps, he only thinks about his degree. Yes, I can see! And when he finishes his studies... his employers will be those that build these roads. - And if there's a killer amongst them? - It's not up to engineers to look for killers. It's up to us all! If you don't need me anymore... Bye, dad. Colasberna wanted things to be clean. He was stubborn. He didn't want to pay for protection. And he refused to blackmail. Captain! But those who pay protection know that they'll never get inspected, therefore they can go on quietly building their bridges with manure! If we don't gel rid of these people, they'll kill someone else. And in the meantime we're still looking for Colasberna's killer. And this is my fear above all, that it's not the last of the killings. This one's capable of coming here every day to gel on our nerves. - Add a bit more cement! - OK. Without anonymous letters or informers, we'd be going around in circles... and you know that, Captain. I'm sorry, Captain, but it's my experience that makes me a bit controversial. You're still enthusiastic and without kids at university... Who is our informer here? Parrineddu, I'm here. At your orders, Captain. At your service, Captain. Parrineddu, do you know where Colasberna was killed? Yes, he was found dead there. Murdered. - By who? - By who... Wake up! I asked you who? - If only I knew... - So what do you know? Captain, let's not talk here. Let's gel away from the road. I need to stay alive, Captain. It's in the interests of justice. Yes, sir, there are plenty of Captains and Carabinieri - but informers are rare. They mustn't be sent off to the slaughter due to hastiness! Look, if you don't give up what you know, I'll send you to the butchers right away! Look, I'm running out of patience with you. Have you seen Rosa Nicolosi? She's watching us. She's switched off the light but she's still spying. She wants to know the identities of the two people talking near the spot where he died. Forget Rosa Nicolosi. Talk instead! Talk, talk, talk! Captain, the informer merely hints, he doesn't reveal. The real truth lies between a thousand lies, because the informer doesn't trust the Carabinieri. And you told me just now that if I didn't talk... tomorrow you'd tell the killers that I betrayed them? Right, Captain? - And so? - Or you can summon me to court, as a witness. - No. I can assure you. - But who knows? My betrayal would no longer be a necessity, and would instead turn into disgrace. Captain, betrayal is a living for me. This evening I betray the mafia, tomorrow the Carabineri. It's balanced. A little bit for everyone! Good, now get to the point. The order came from the cement, but who was to shoot was decided by a card game. Two shots, and a cuckold met the King of Diamonds. It's not true that cuckolds are lucky! - And so the cuckold is Nicolosi? - Easy, Captain! Not so fast... We're talking about an imaginary cuckold. Nameless, just simply a cuckold. But whosoever murdered Colasberna, killed him because of cement, and not for honour. Careful, Captain. There is a catch, but you can'! see it. So, Parrineddu, you're also in with them? Captain, if you're not happy with me and don'! want to give me the money, you can pay me another time when you feel more satisfied. How do you manage to be an informer? You... you're scared stiff! There's always a little bit of fear, no? Or perhaps not for you? Look, with the help of your information, before I arrived here, the previous person in charge arrested two fugitives and a smuggler. Why so much small talk this time, Parrineddu? Is it ho! stuff? So they're big shots, eh? Powerful people? Captain, cement or honour... you can ask the name of the King of Diamonds... to that pretty woman. If you can find a way. - Rosa! Rosa Nicolosi! - Who is it? - Captain Bellodi. - What do you want? I need to talk to you. I'm sorry, I have bad news for you. Your husband's been killed. They shot him. We don't know who it was, but we're searching for them. Zecchinetta! It was him! Zecchinetta'? He killed Colasberna? - Yes! - Your husband saw him and he knew that he'd been seen? I told him when I heard the shots... I told him... Don't leave the house! Don't go out! Why didn't he listen to me'? Why didn't he listen to me? No, no, Rosa! Calm yourself, it's not true! It's not true... I made it up... We still don'! know anything about your husband. I needed a name... I'm sorry. How could you?! You do what you want, eh? - I have to find the killer. - And my husband? Where is he? We're still searching for him. So, that morning after he saw Zecchinetta what did he do? I know, I know what you want to say to me... You want to say to me: "Go to hell, you dirty cop". You shouldn't have said what you did to me... that he was dead. . It's not a joke. Who is this 'Zecchinetta'? It's not his real name. He's called that because he plays cards, right? The name, Rosa! I don't know. Didn't your husband ever tell you? - No. - And you've never seen him in person? No. And why did you go to see Don Mariano? To see whether I could sell him something... some eggs. Now... The plot for 200 million lira goes to you. The one for 250 million is for La Stella. It's a nice dowry for his daughter's wedding. We'll leave the 50 million plot to the brothers of our late friend Salvatore Colasberna. Martino, the bishop's nephew, expected some too. . I don'! want to ruin the bishop's nephew! The plot for 50 million is for the Colasberna brothers. There's nothing better to help forget the dead... than economic difficulties. They'll lose everything they have. They'll be inspected every day with routine checks and then... occasionally, some little accidents as well. As for Martino, I'll give him a waste disposal contract. Waste has good returns. No of fence, but his Excellency had already promised that contract to my cousin. His Excellency can't promise anything. He can only handle his affairs... because I take care of things here. And he handles Rome. - I agree. - OK. OK with me also. Memo. Hey, it's lively out there... Look how the Captain's trying to do his best. They've arrested someone. Geraci, Cinisi, Passatempo... - And Zecchinetta! - Zecchinetta? - Yeah... - And who's that one? - Parrineddu. What happened? - He said they were playing zecchinetta [cards] - Where? At Parrineddu's house. You can tell His Excellency, that it isn't good to have a gung-ho Captain like him here. Saro, bring up some ice cream. Ignazio! Five ice creams! Look at that... greeting each other... My respects... my respects... and here they are still, these big shots, they're not going anywhere. Perhaps they're wondering if I've arrested those guys for gambling or for something else. We need to let them know. Captain, do you plan to let those we arrested walk free? - Absolutely! - And Parrineddu, right? - Sure, him too, otherwise he's done for - Shall we let them go, then'? Not right away, later. All... except for one. They play cards every day, and the Carabinieri never came before. But it's the first time they've played at Parrineddu's house. That's true. Never played there before... So, Zecchinetta goes to play at Parrineddu's house... and then the cops arrive... The captain's watching us... with binoculars. I don't like binoculars... What are you doing? You think you know me? Yeah, look at me... look at my profile too! You're a nobody! Try and touch us, if you have the guts... Don'! assume that these cops are all stupid! There are those that can tear out your tongue, along with all your secrets: men who were born cops, just as others were born priests. Bellodi is one that was born a cop... Parrineddu on the other hand... was born a spy. Zecchinetta hasn't come out yet. What did you expect? They want to squeeze a confession out of him. We've got a traitor among us, I'm sure of it. Don Mariano... Don Mariano! May I have a word? I have to talk to you. - Play... well, speak! - In private! In private with you'?! And who are you, the Lord? As you wish, then. Let's go for a walk. Don Mariano, did you write that letter? - Of course, don't worry. - Thank you. Zecchinetta sent me, and urged me to tell you that his lips are sealed. Zecchinetta'? Who is he? As far as I'm concerned, he can spend his whole life in there. That's what he said, so that's what I'm telling you. Parrineddu! How was the game? Well, I won... but they blew the whistle on us all, so I guess we all lost in the end. You shouldn't have gone up against the Santa Chiesa. What can you do now? Nothing. I'm just saying that you're dead in the heart of your friends. - 34... 35... 36... - Let's go, Zecchinetta The Captain wants to question you. Just a moment, I have to do my exercises first. - Move it! - One moment, I need to do something... Come on! I should introduce myself whilst doing my trousers up? My respects, Captain! I knew the Captain... who was here before you. A man of good heart! Captain, if you want to beat me up, I've something I must tell you first: I suffered from pleurisy; they took an x-ray, did you know that? So, how are we doing, Mr. Marchica, alias 'Zecchinetta'? Given your past crimes, I can'! let you go. However, no one will ever know what you tell me. And what do I have to tell you? I want to get to those at the lop and if you help me, you won't regret it. - If only I could, Captain... - Very well. So let's talk about the game. We were playing just to pass the time. There aren't any free women in this town! And a wife just isn't enough. A man who is content with just one woman loses his desire. For example, when I'm in bed with her, I always think of Stalin. I don'! know why. - How much did you lose? - Mel? - You. - A little. - How much is 'a little'? - Let's say about twenty. - Do you lose every day? - No, some days I'm up. - No, you're not the winning type. - The testimony of your friends shows, that in the last two weeks you lost around - I won that money! - Against who? Someone from 'out of town', let's say. My understanding is that the money you lost at cards is money that Pizzuco gave you. Why did Pizzuco pay you? Captain, Pizzuco never gave me any money. Whoever said that is a big... - a bastard, I know! - There, exactly! So you won a game worth 200,000 lira against a foreigner, and then you lost this money whilst playing against friends. Is that so? - Shall we say it was like that? - Yeah, it was like that. - Write that... put it all down. - No, wait... Marchica may want to clarify. Have a think about it. There's nothing to think about, Captain. Liars need to think. What I'm saying is the truth! But you, Captain... before you talk you have to think, because you tell lies. You tell lies for a living, of course! - Yeah, yeah. You should be an actor. - Heh, well... - Yeah, why not? You've got talent! - C'mon, you're teasing me, Captain! - Where did you put the rifle? - What? Which rifle? The rifle with which you shot Nicolosi. - Mel? - Yes, you. Nicolosi? Captain! Me!? "Me? Me? Me? Me?" - Don't you know how to say anything other than 'Me'? Ah, you didn't know Nicolosi? Have a good think about it. Yeah, I knew him once... but then... Captain... a bit of that beer wouldn't hurt, right? Thanks, thanks! You said that you 'knew' him - does it mean that you know he's dead? The marshal said that I killed him! I said that you fired - but now you just clarified that you killed him. - Captain! - Yes... because, Marchica, you have been accused of murdering Nicolosi. Haven'! you realised? Prove it! You need proof! What motive would I have to do it? Where is it?! What is this motive? The motive? Here it is: Nicolosi died because he saw who killed Colasberna. He had seen the killer. - And who killed this Colasberna? - You! Admit it, Zecchinetta: it was you! Me? Me?! Pull out my fingernails, and break my fingers... and you'll have a great confession! Let go! Leave me alone! I'll jump out the window! You're taking advantage because I'm alone... Let go of me! Let go of me! I can'! take it, cowards! I want to die! Captain, if you'll allow me to go free, I'll give you a nice present... I'll give you the name of Colasberna's killer, and the motive. - We're listening. - Nicolosi killed Colasberna... because he caught him in an awkward position! - Such as? - He was on top of his wife, Rosa... they were lovers. Everyone knew that they were lovers. So then, tell me who killed Nicolosi, after he killed Colasberna to protect his honour? Nicolosi? Why are you saying that he's dead? You should rather say he's missing! To say that someone is dead, you need a body! Captain, look for Nicolosi... and let the innocent people like me go free. Write it down! I'll sign everything! I won't hold anything back! So, after I'm done, can I go? After I've signed the agreement? I'm sorry, Mr. Marchica... I'm afraid that you'll have to stay away from your home and friends a little while longer. Cut it out with this "Mr. Marchica". Zecchinetta's my name, and I'm no "Mister". Get a belt and thrash me! Break my bones! Anything but a "mister", and why don't you drop the formalities! Come on, Sergeant! Don't think about my pleurisy, just beat me! Don't even hope for it! Read it and sign. You're cruel-hearted, Captain. Just because I have a black mark against me, everything that happens is Zecchinetta's fault. But you're wrong. I'm a gentleman. I'm back on the right path. And the names of those who saw Colasberna and Rosa Nicolosi... doing their filth out in the field? Don't you want to know? No. At the moment we're only interested in knowing why... - Pizzuco gave you 200,000 lira? - Business! Despicable! You're shameful, Zecchinetta. You took just 200,000 lira for two hits. Well, I'll get out of here, Captain, I'm telling you - you're too arrogant! Too arrogant! Hey, does the Captain believe in God? - Move it! - So can Hake a pee now? Go on, move it! What did he mean by 'arrogant'? An arrogant person is someone that wants to know the truth. Balloons for sale! - Good day, Don Mariano. - Good day. Don Mariano... may I have a word? They put a bomb in the Captain's car. It's ready to explode. Which car is it? And where's Pizzuco? He went inside the bar to wait for the fireworks. Greetings, Don Mariano. And so, Don Pizzuco? You're doing things your own way now? Without my permission? If Zecchinetta squeals, I'll be the first that goes down. - Who took care of the job? - The boys. The Captain... Toruzzo... So you think that with the Captain dead, no one will question Zecchinetta any more'? That Captain's no good for us here. If no one thinks to take him out, then I will! - You're without honour... - Don Mariano! One who puts his friends and their children in danger is a man without honour. Captain! You've got a flat tire; probably a nail. What a pity, it's a new tire as well... We can fit the spare lyre for you? No, don't want to inconvenience you. We have our own mechanic. It's Sunday today, let him rest! We can do it for you in two minutes, Captain! - Go! Go! Go! Put the hand brake on. - My respects, Captain! - Thanks. - Can I gel you a coffee? - Thanks, perhaps another lime. - With all my heart! Now try to do what I tell you. Today, you'll go and see Rosa Nicolosi. Bu! why? What does Rosa have to do with us? - I said that you must go to her house! - And do what? That's up to you - go to bed with her for all I care, but just stay there for a little while. Nothing else. Understood? - Thanks! - Oh no, no! - Your keys... - What, are you joking?! - God forbid, I wouldn't dream of it! - Always at your service, Captain! - Those two are previous offenders, Captain. - C'mon, Marshal! It's Sunday today. We'll need to tell the mechanic to remove the explosives they've put in the car. Bastards! I'll slap them straight inside! Calm down... Strange. First they rigged it, but then they changed their minds. Why? Maybe he'd be able to tell us. - You really believe that? - Of course! Look at him, he stopped in front... of us deliberately. As if he wants us to know, or tell us something. Come on, why did you slop? Have you changed your mind? Calm down, I can see you. I can see you very well. But remember that it's me who upholds the law here. You're going against me? Then I accept your challenge. Understand? He's telling us that he has powerful friends... and that it's better to leave him alone. That's right. What shall we do, Captain? We need an answer. We'll prepare a warrant. - For Don Mariano? - No, not yet. What are you doing, Captain? You're not starting it up, are you!? Don't worry, Don Mariano's allowing us to live a bit longer. Parrineddu! MY respects! Keep an eye on my friend Pizzuco for me today. - And then? - Nothing... just make a note of it. - Good day, Don Mariano. - Is the secretary in? - Yes. - I'd like to speak to him. At once, please do come in! Good day, Rosa! May I? - Good day... - Heh, heh, what a beautiful, naked, young girl! Why are you hiding? - She's embarrassed. - Wait, I'll help you! There! She looks like a queen in a carriage! - There. - There? - Yes. Here we go! You're not looking at me, eh? There you are, little one! - Dry and dress yourself. - You have a beautiful daughter! She'll be as pretty as you when she's older. I remember you were just like that. - I watched you grow up, Rosa. - So, what did you want to tell me? I'll have a glass of wine, if that's OK? I came to tell you that you're beautiful. Doesn't that please you? What do you mean? Haven't you brought news of my husband? Don Mariano told me the other day: "if I know something, I'll inform you". - Ah, Don Mariano... and what else did he tell you'? - Not to worry... So don'! worry. - So... why did you come? - Out of curiosity. Ah! Come here, beautiful. I have something for you, come! Come on, go outside to play, OK? Bye... Not too far! You've ruined my life, Rosa. All those times that you passed in front... of my house, or when I'd meet you and you'd look at me with those eyes. Y'know, Rosa? Don't be a fool - I've never once thought about you. It seems so! Now that you've had your drink, you can go. - What a light dress you've got on... - Your hand... Your hand! What did you think'? You think you can do that if I don't want it'? Ah, lake a walk! You'll just have to make do with your whore of a wife! Don'! touch me with those hands, they make me sick! Think you can molest a woman?! Get out! Rosa, what's the matter? Are you going to cry now? So you came here just to make yourself comfortable. And you're not afraid? You're not afraid that my husband will find out? Why aren't you afraid? Why'? You must tell me why! Ehh! These Sicilian women! Always so dramatic! I want to move to Milan! A breath of fresh air! Rosa, if you come with me, I'll separate from my wife, OK'? Will you come? No? Cheerio, then! Why are you all standing around?! Is this how you earn the money that I pay you? Ah, Captain! May I offer you something? A beer? Or some orangeade if you want? Mr. Pizzuco, you must come with us. You're under arrest. Under arrest? If they've killed someone between 3 and 4 o'clock, I can tell you that I was at the house of a woman whose name... I won't mention... unless it's absolutely necessary. - Come on, give me your wrists. - Sure, wait... just wait! - You want to resist? - What's the rush? Worried I'm going to run away? - Control yourself, Pizzuco! - Bravo, congratulations! Employing all these well-paid officers of the State... to arrest a decent man like me! Poor Italian tax-payers! Take a good look: my face doesn't have any scratches, and I'm in perfect health! As I hope to be when they release me! Luigi, don'! pay him for the time he was standing around doing nothing! Inform my mother and tell her to go straight to the lawyer! And you, wash my car! You wench! They've arrested my son! They've arrested my innocent son! We had to get a lawyer, you must give us back the money we spent, wench! So, write... "A greengrocer" "A greengrocer buys five kilos... " Nicolosi? - Rosa Nicolosi? - Yes... - Are you the wife of Tano Nicolosi? - Yes. - Your husband sent me. - Where is he? - Palermo; he's working there. - Palermo? And he's left me here? Without any word!? - Where's he working? - I don'! know. I me! him in a pub. And when he found out that I usually take this route, he gave me this envelope. - Are you sure that it was him? - He said that he was. Why would he lie? - Not a single word... '.7 - There wasn't lime, but he sent the money. Wait... Is it him? Yes, it's him. Where's he staying? The address...? - He didn't give it to me. - But didn't he say when he'll return? He said he'd return as soon as he could... but with an expression as though he was not able to. As if he was in hiding. Wait! Hey, wait! Who sent you here? Careful; even though he's away, if you don't behave like a wife, he'll know. Out of the way! Caterina! Open up! I don't want to stay in here! To me it seems like you're taking advantage too much! - What's going on, Marshal? - Zecchinetta's yelling that he wants to get out. He says that the number of detention days are over. He says that it's his right to have either an arrest warrant or his freedom. - Captain, are we going to observe the law'? - Sergeant! Al your orders! Hand over Zecchinetta's personal belongings and let him go. Captain, do you really want to let him go free? - Of course! - Didn't the judge sign the arrest warrants? I've got both of them in my pocket. But Zecchinetta must enjoy a taste of freedom, and I want him to do it in the main square, in order to trick him and his friends. Get out. Sony, Captain! My release must cause you great pain! Who was it that you got yesterday? - My respects, Don Vincenzo! - Ah, so they released you, Zecchinetta? Hello, my friend! See you around. - Yeah, yeah, see you! - lgnazio! - A nice sweet black coffee! - At once. Did I leave the window open? Shall we have some fresh lemonade, General? You wanted to know who we arrested yesterday? - A dear friend of yours, who you know very well. - Me? Pizzuco. Look up at Don Mariano's terrace... Pizzuco isn't there... You know, he told us a lot of things about you... - About me? - He says that you do whatever he wants. Your hand is shaking. Drink up... drink this coffee slowly so that you'll remember it... They don'! make it as good as that in prison, you know... You've gone all pale! Who played this trick on me? Don Mariano? - Damn cuckold! - Your mother, wife and sister... You'll pay for this with tears of blood! You damn big cuckold... They make the 'horn' sign and they're all happy. - Marshal! - Here! Prepare a false confession from Pizzuco. It must say that it was Zecchinetta who killed Colasberna. This confession has to be like a work of art! Like an expos of the mafia code. A confession such that when Zecchinetta reads it, he feels betrayed. - And if Pizzuco confesses first? - No chance. Zecchinetta goes down first. Prepare the confession! - And the signature? - You want to put a real signature... on a false confession? You sign it! It could be amusing for me; I'm good at imitating handwriting! You'll see: it'll be a good job, Captain. Yes, we should do it - but without enjoying it too much, and at least with a little bit of disgust. Rosa, can we take a picture? Let's take one, Rosa. Come on, just one! Hi Annuzza, how are you... - Bless you, Don Mariano! - I can wait; I'm in no hurry. - Greetings, Don Mariano! - Greetings... Let's read all the bad news, right? It seems as though someone's looking for you. Who is it? Don Mariano, I'd like to talk to you, if you don't mind? - And who are you? - Nicolosi's wife - don'! you remember? Rosa, please, I'm trying to work here. Excuse me, but can I speak to you alone? Alone? You can'! here... Tonight... when you're alone... then I'll pay you a visit! You're provoking me, girl- what should I tell you? If it's so urgent, tell me! Speak, we're among friends here. I heard that my husband is in Palermo. Someone on a motorbike came and told me this morning. Palermo? Good! Beautiful city. Lucky him! Is he really in Palermo? Is he in Palermo or here, under the ground?! You still insist on questioning me about where your husband is! What am I, your pimp? No! No, you are not my pimp! I don'! have a pimp! I have nothing to be ashamed of! In Palermo it looks like they've uncovered a house full of women, that kind of women... from the cellar, all the way up to the top floor. Nice, eh? - We need to have one here, too! - But you have to find the goods first? There's some right there! What is it? Are you offended? Nobody asked you! The motorcycle was stolen. A man that comes from Palermo with a letter from your husband, isn't the type that arrives riding a stolen motorcycle. Understand? A thief doesn't bring money to the wife of a guy who is known at the pub. He keeps it! So, it was faked then? Perhaps it's not even true that a man brought money to the house? - What? - Yes, come in. Maybe you're lying to help someone? What do you mean 'someone'? And who should I help? Who can assure me that Don Mariano didn't send you to purposely confuse things? So that's what you think? Even though I came here?! Yes, but you also went to Don Mariano's. And it wasn't to sell your eggs... Bu! if it was your woman, wouldn't you go to look and to ask everyone? I'm doing it for my husband! Just accept it: they murdered him. Yes, on the same day that they killed Colasberna. He was too dangerous alive. But they want us to believe he's still alive. And to save themselves, they discredit you. At the moment they're coming up with a false testimony to make out... that you were Colasberna's lover. Yes, and sooner or later they'll let the judge know about it. I've only ever been with my husband. No-one else has ever seen me naked! OK, let's suppose that I'm mistaken, and that he returns home... and when he returns, what does he find? A person that decent women don'! stop to say hello to, someone that men slop on the street, as if they could take her to bed whenever they wanted! Well, it's better that he doesn't return then... Rosa, let these people hang! Where do you think I live, Captain?! I live among these people, and when I walk past, it's as if they're undressing me with their eyes. I feel naked! When I tell you that eyewitnesses saw Colasberna... together with that woman, Rosa Nicolosi, it's a precise accusation, about which there cannot be any doubt. Sure, the cuckold - that is, the husband, knew nothing... Either that, or he pretended not to know anything. This is something you should investigate. So when the husband discovered them, he killed Colasberna? - Exactly! - Sit down! After being cuckolded, don't you think he'd have wanted to kill the wife before the lover? Perhaps he would? If he's a man of honour he'll do it... But is he a man of honour? You should investigate this point, too. So you're trying to tell me that the deceased will come down from heaven... or up from hell and kill his wife? What a clown you are... If he comes back, he'll come back from Palermo. You can't send money and letters to the family from heaven! But I think that someone else sent that money to Rosa. - Who would that be? - Someone's who's alive. You, my dear! - Me? - Yes! - I might have given her some money. - Ah, you see?! I brought her the money personally, because I 'had' her in her house, if you will... So, if you're Rosa's lover, then you killed Colasberna... out of jealousy, and the husband because he discovered you both. And Pizzuco ends up in jail forever. Nonsense! It can't be... because I was with her after the murder, and I also have the proof! She's a hot blooded woman - you don'! know her. She's money-hungry, wants everything! But she has skin like velvet... if I had the choice of how I wanted to die, I'd choose to die on top of her! Well done, Rosa! You were Pizzuco's lover and you didn't tell us a thing. - Lover? No. We'd just meet from time to time. - They wan! to ruin me! In short, Rosa, did you or didn't you have a relationship with him? Yes or no? Of course not! With someone like him!? - Then you were Colasberna's lover? - No! No! No! But it's right that you believe them over me. He has powerful friends... and I'm all alone. - Rosa, don't talk rubbish. - Nah, I expected it... making a scene by crying. Women are allowed to. Hey, you... Lies, right? - No. - Sit down. Instead, why don't you tell the Captain who your husband worked for? For me'? For La Stella? For Colosimo, perhaps? Eh? I'll tell him who he worked for. No, I'll tell you. Last year he worked for 120 days... in Colasberna's company. Carry on, Pizzuco. I'll continue. And why did he work for Colasberna? Why, Rosa? Why? What does that mean? So, you do business with Don Mariano... because your wife is his mistress'? Calm down! Damn it... Fine, I'm not going to rise to her provocations. - Yes, you're a cuckold! - It's useless to deny about us. I have witnesses. Ask Parrineddu; he knows everything. - He saw me at Rosa's house. - No! It's not true! It's not true that I was at your house? - By tricking me! - There! I knew it - now she's going to cry! - Go ahead, Rosa. - He came into my house by tricking me. Yeah, yeah... "tricks"! He tried to take me by force, but couldn't. I've only taken money from one man in my life, and that's my husband! I'm his woman, and no-one else's! He received money from Colasberna to turn a blind eye! Give me back my husband! What have you done with him? If he's dead, you killed him! If he's alive, you know where he is! Pizzuco... - Lower your voice. - Yeah, OK. . And Zecchinetta? What can you tell me about Zecchinetta? Listen, Captain. You bring me Nicolosi's body here and then we'll talk. Rosa, why didn't you tell me that your husband worked for Colasberna? You understand that these are facts that could go against you? That's their business. It's up to the man to say what to do. The woman must always keep her mouth shut! Be careful, Rosa! Because, as a result of denying everything... and remaining silent, you could end up being blamed for everything, instead of others. Go on. The morning that Colasberna was killed, what happened? Captain, I swear on my daughter's head that Colasberna never touched me! I know! I know this! What I want to know is, what did your husband do afterward? Where did he go? He didn't tell me. He didn't tell me... OK, Rosa, so what shall we do? Now you can go home and... write me a nice anonymous letter? Me? Yes. You can try and tell me the truth that way. Listen, I've never done anything like that. And besides, I've already told you the truth. - Marshal! - Yes sir? - You can go now. How's it going? - He's a tough nut to crack. Keep at him, and don'! let him sleep. And tell... Parrineddu... that I want to see him here in town tomorrow. Ah... and Zecchinetta in my office, now. - Wait a while and then show him Pizzuco's false confession. - Yes, Sir. You seem to know everyone. Take a little look at that distinguished gentleman... who's chatting with Don Mariano. It's not a new face is it? No... I don'! know him. Come now, that's Minister Botta. He's a part of the puzzle. What 'puzzle'? He is the link that joins Don Mariano and Honorable Minister Passarella. Captain, I don't know him. I've never seen him before. Captain... Pizzuco! - Sit down! - A signed confession. You've been done! Pizzuco accuses you of killing Colasberna! - Me?! And on whose behalf? - On your own initiative. Pizzuco said he confided in you how Colasberna had offended him... and that you offered to avenge him. But Pizzuco, a man of principle and opposed to violence, refused. But you went ahead and killed Colasberna, all the same. Me? In that case I'm crazy, then?! You killed him because you owed Pizzuco the 200,000 lira you lost to him in 2 game. Pizzuco claims that after meeting him, you said: "Partivu pe astutarinni unu, e mi tucc astularinni dui. " Which means: "I set out to kill one, but I had to kill two" - Two? - Colasberna and Nicolosi, because he saw you. Nicolosi? And where's his body'?! Did I eat it?!! Or buried it. There's a lot of land out there! And the rifle? Where did I hide it? In Rosa's a. . ? Read it. Read it, if you don't believe. - Yes? - Bastard! - Not now. Eat! Eat up, but don't rush - your friend Pizzuco signed two of them. Don Mariano and Pizzuco are sending you to jail for life! To think that if you'd just talk, it would be them going to prison instead. Write! I'll talk now! So, who gave you the order? Don Mariano? And stop defending him as if he were God Almighty! Don Mariano's got nothing to do with it. Pizzuco is the one! - Pizzuco has called you to testify. - Me? He says that you saw him at Rosa Nicolosi's house and wants you to confirm it. What happened at Rosa's house? He forced himself upon her. I saw him from outside. - And her? - She was willing enough. - Are you sure'? - That's how it seemed to me. That's how it seemed, or that's how it was? If you make me say that Rosa wasn't willing, they'll want me dead! But I want to save you. Well, you go ahead with what they've told you to say about Rosa... but in exchange, I want something from you. - What's that? - You have to help me arrest Don Mariano. No, Captain. I don'! know anything about Don Mariano. I can'! help you with this. If you testify against Rosa, I'll testify against you. I'll fry you! How long will you last after that? But I don'! know anything about Don Mariano. I'd tell you if I did. I don'! believe you. I always thought that you knew a lo! about Don Mariano, but you keep it hush-hush. Enough playing both sides, Parrineddu! It's us who pay you, not them. - I don't want it! - Don't talk rubbish. Afterwards, Zecchinetta took the rifle to Don Mariano's house. - Did you see him? - I live near him. - And why to Don Mariano's? - Because it's the safest place. - You have to testify. - Mel? Captain, our deal? No court, you said! That doesn't count anymore. Don Mariano wouldn't go back on his word. I want him in front of the judge... and I don't want to hear anything about lack of evidence. - Pizzuco! - Zecchinetta! You bastard! You'll end up worse than Colasberna. Much worse! Pizzuco! You should be a singer! A singer! - They should cut out your tongue! Lowlife! - Bastard! Informer! You're a cop! You're the bloody spy! Good day, Captain. Pizzuco has confessed, but it took all night to get him to sign! Naturally, not a single word about Don Mariano, though. The saints are untouchable! If you'll allow me, Captain, I'm going to get some sleep. There's something urgent that needs to be done. After that, I'll leave you to sleep, even for 24 hours. Get the men, we're going to touch those Saints! - But do we have the proof against him, Captain? - Yes. Can't we put it off until tomorrow? His Excellence Passarella arrives today, to help him to inaugurate the new road. No. His Excellence Passarella will unveil the road... without having to stand next to that big shot. The man who built it with manure and blood. For the prestige of the State, he must do it knowing that Don Mariano is in prison... and accused of murder. Daddy! Daddy! Daddy! The Carabinieri are here. But what for? What's happened? - Destroy it at once! - What's happening? Tell me, please, I want to know! I want to know! Tomorrow, you'll leave for Switzerland. And whatever you read in the newspapers... about me, it's not true. Understand? Go on, go! - What's happening? - Calm down! Calm down! - But, sir! Only honorable people live here! - Go and stay in the kitchen. But if I woke you up at this hour, then there must be a reason, no? Sure! Alert our friends. Wake up the ministers in Rome! Tell everyone! One moment! Please! And to what pleasure do I owe this visit, at such an early hour? If you cast your mind back to your youth, you'll recall that this is the time when... the Carabinieri make their visit when they want to arrest someone. The search has already begun, and it won't be long until the handcuffs. They came to arrest me! Give it to me. These are my savings. The dates of your deposits coincide exactly with the dates of the public works. 'Public works'? I'm a land-owner. I lent some money to friends... and they paid it back to me. - You've no part in the construction companies, then? - No, no... none at all. Many companies have obtained contracts by illegal means, - thanks to your recommendations. - I do thousands of them. Contracts, licenses, sites, subsidies... - So, who do you give them to? - My friends, who are able to do things. Who usually? Whoever shows themselves to be the best friend. - And what do you get out of them? - Friendship. Look! So it seems as though you're not worried about taxes, then? I'm not worried about anything. I'm ignorant; I only know a few things. For example, I know that under the nose we have a mouth... which is more for eating... than for talking. I also have a mouth under my nose, even if it only eats government bread. I know... But you're a man. They say you're religious... Well... I go to church every Sunday. I donate to charity. - Do you think that's enough? - Why wouldn't it be? The church is huge. Everyone does things their own way in there. Laura, the coffee! And what do you think of the Gospel? Ahh... beautiful words! The church is all beauty. Do you think it's right to kill a man? I've never done anything of the sort. But if you're asking me theoretically, then it would depend on who the man is. Ah, so according to you, there are two types of man? I divide humanity into five categories: There are the real men, the half men, the so-so men... and then, if you'll excuse me, the faggots... and finally, it's as if they didn't exist, the gossips who are worth nothing! There are very few real men and only a few half men. The majority of men are so-so. They're like kids who think they're grown-ups. As for the queers, they're growing to become a real army. And lastly, the blabbermouths... A flock of geese. But, even if you nailed me, you're a man! And why do you consider me to be a man? Because someone in your position can trample over people easily. And I received insults far worse than death from your predecessors. They slapped me. Another put his cigarette out on my hand... and how he laughed! Can you sleep when you've been ridiculed like that? - So, I don'! offend you then? - No, you're a man. You loo, Don Mariano. But I'll still have to send you to jail. - You should have arrested me before. - I didn't have the proof. Proof? With or without proof, it's the same thing! Captain... we found this weapon inside a cupboard. The proof! You're a magician! - This rifle has killed at least two men. - More than that. It's 40 years old! But the last were Colasberna and Nicolosi. I bought it from a 'picciotto'. [lowest level of mafia hierarchy] From who? From Zecchinetta? - Yes, I think so. That was his name. - But you bought it the morning of the crime, while it was still hot, and you didn't pay for it. Because Zecchinetta who talks a lot, never said a word about receiving money for the weapon. Then you must explain to me why, if I'm so sly and powerful as you say, I would keep the murder weapon in my house? Because you're so sure of yourself that you never thought that someone... would come and search your home. Mariano Arena, in the name of the law, I declare you under arrest. You're accused of being behind the murders of Salvatore Colasberna and Gaetano Nicolosi. - Look, Don Mariano! - Don Mariano! Don Mariano, I swear to you, neither I nor Zecchinetta mentioned your name. We were fighting between ourselves, like two cocks. - Have you signed anything? - Yes. Idiots! You deserve to end up here. Bang your head against here and don't stop until I say so... I said, bang it. Bang it! Again! - What did you do to your forehead? - I fell. Don't even think about saying that it was us who beat you! No, I fell! Long live Monsignor! Long live Monsignor! Take the cuffs off. I said goodbye to family and friends... ...and an old woman too. They took a big shot here! A big shot! Rosa! This way! This way! Sit here and eat this roll. Sit down, Rosa. Sit, don'! be scared. Have you received news of your husband? Sometimes husbands can go crazy. They run off and leave their wife and kids. To Tunisia, to America... - To Milan. - To France. - To Switzerland. - Or to Germany... Do you need help, Rosa'? Don't worry... we'll lake care of you and your child, until your husband returns. And if he doesn't come back, you won't be left abandoned, and no-one will treat you with disrespect. Are we agreed? No one will treat her with disrespect. Even though you didn't show respect to someone... Someone who didn't do anything to you. But Don Mariano is a good man, who'll forgive and forget a fit of desperation. He knows that you're a good woman. Rosa said some things that were wrong and untrue! Yes, she did - but in good faith, without understanding the consequences. When Rosa said "zecchinetta", she wanted to say that that night... her husband came back late, because he went to play cards. - It was a misunderstanding! - A misunderstanding, exactly! He never met Zecchinetta! He went to play 'zecchinetta', the card game. A card game. But the Captain took it another way. Of course, how could he have known? The Captain is from the North. He doesn't know us. They distorted it all. Don't you agree, Rosa? I'll ask my husband how I need to act, when he returns! Tomorrow I'm going to tell the truth to the judge. That when they killed Colasberna, Zecchinetta was watering my land. If he was working 70 kilometers from your house, Rosa, then how could he be guilty of the crime? Sure! Sure! My cousin can testify to it, too. It's a disgrace that these gentlemen are in prison. They'll gel out. They'll gel out. And you, if you don'! tell the truth, they'll say you did it to cause harm. Out of bitterness. Is that nice? No, it's not - nor is it fair. Do you agree, Rosa? This dish is too salty. Rosa, what are you doing? You're leaving? Where are you going? Where am I going? It's just that I'm ashamed of this dress and these bare arms. I'm in mourning, aren't I? So I should dress in mourning. - Who is it? - Rosa Nicolosi. - That morning... - No, come on, Rosa. Come in! Tell me. - So, that morning? - That morning Pizzuco called my husband... for work, he said. My husband went and I never saw him again. We haven't stopped looking for him. Look at these glasses - they were found at Pizzuco's site. None of the workers there recognizes them. Are they your husband's? - I... I don't know. - Didn't he wear sunglasses? Yes, but I don't know if it's them. You must believe me, I can tell you the truth in here, and I've told you! What you say inside here is useless, if you won't repeat it outside! No! I came to tell you, but I won'! testify outside. You won't speak in from of the judges, right? I have to think about my daughter. You know what they're saying here? They say my investigation is just... a political campaign to sling mud at certain big shots in Rome! That the confessions were forced! That Don Mariano was a victim! They say that I've blamed an honest man, and that I deliberately avoided investigating the crime of passion! Do you understand!? I'm saving you from ruin! And what are you doing for me? - I did what I could. - No! Like the others, you did what I told you to do! You did nothing of your own free will! But I still managed, all the same. Even though I received only... silence from all of you, instead of help. Well, what is it, Rosa? Are you also thinking that I'm, as all the others say, 'arrogant'? Go on, say it! What do I know? Who knows you? ''At the inauguration above the authorities, the dead underneath " - Captain Bellodi! - You can'! pass. Let me through! Captain Bellodi! Captain, do you want a drink? - What are you doing? Are you pulling it all up? - Piece by piece. Everything. And who'll pay for it? Corporal! Come here! Come, we've found him! - Captain, here! - Let the Captain through! Come on, hurry! - Who is it? - It's him, the one they were searching for... Rosa Nicolosi's husband. The one they couldn't find. Come on, turn him over! - Parrineddu! - It's Parrineddu! Remove that cork from his mouth. That letter, Captain... you got it? It's them who sent it. Masons, builders, carpenters, laborers, unemployed! Bring yourselves to the housing projects! Bless you, Don Mariano! My respects, Don Mariano! Don Mariano is back! He's a good Christian! Santuzza! Bring me the binoculars from the writing desk. The air in Palermo didn't do me any good. It made me feel heavy and nauseous. My head always felt heavy. Have you heard? They arrested the director of the Provinciale Bank. Why did they arrest him? He was a good man. That's why they arrested him. Because he was a good man, of course! He'll get out. He'll get out soon enough! We go! out too, didn't we!? You can speak when the hen pisses! (I. e. Shut up!) There's a new Captain. Give it to me. He has a likeable face. Open-minded. Take it. You're right, like a father. I be! he's got a wife and kids. Even better, if he has a big family, he'll take care of his own business. - He'll always be a Carabiniere. - Like Bellodi. Bellodi was a man. This one seems a blabbermouth. - Blabbermouth! - Blabbermouth. .
