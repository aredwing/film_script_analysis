We come out here... It's country developed this way! It's the end of the line, brother! You can't go no further than this! You do... One thing's for sure... You gonna get wet! [laughs] [sirens blaring] [man narrating] It was one of those nights... You know the kind, when you can feel it in your bones... and the tingle in the palms of your hands... When you just know somehow... That you're gonna get lucky! [horn honking, tires squealing] [woman] You asshole! Hi, yeah... Just hit the button on the ground, she'll start right up. Uh, say listen, uh... I love this car... Take very special care of it for me, will ya? Sure. No dings. [mumbles to herself, engine starts up] [man over speaker] Greenscene... seeks to radically change the way people view their existence. To change, not just to think about the spotted owl or plastic trash bags, but about God and the Earth. Think about the world as a living organism, not a storehouse of physical resources. Think about creation as an ongoing process, not something that ended after seven tumultuous days, thousands of years ago. Think about nature as having rights, too. And of those rights, not coming from us. And think about and understand that what we are talking about, what we are dealing with here tonight, is nothing less than the very survival of this planet. [classical music ] [clears throat] Can I have you? What?! Can i have your name? Uh, trade you! What? You give me mine, I give you yours. Uh... - What? Uh... Madler. John Madler. Oh, you're him! I think so. Um... Allison McKenzie. Oh, you're her. - Yes. Yes...here's your name tag. Uh, you keep that. I prefer anonymity. Excuse me. Certainly. John, you're fucking late! There's so many people here just dying to meet you. I want you to know that I'm fucking pissed at you! The Frazers, the Frazers! This is our John Madler. Oh, your work is extraordinary! And to be completely honest, I don't know why! Perhaps dear, complete honesty is not absolutely necessary. Oh, but I just love it! The color, the balance, the sense that something's about to happen off the frame... Thank you. We'll be seeing more of you! Oh, you will, Tom. You have my assurance of that! A martini with a twist. And? A beer. - You got it! Put it in a glass. Don't drink from the bottle here. I'm not going to fuck around with you. I think you have talent and, more importantly, can sell. If we can find something to spark it. This auction, this fundraiser, could be an important event to execute that plan. Introduce us to your artist, Mr. Saffron. Of course, Mrs. Norton. Alicia Norton and her granddaughter, Beatrice Norton. This is John Madler. Do you think your work is sexy, Mr. Madler? No? See, I told you it was your imagination! But I could be wrong. I love what you do. Well, we haven't seen everything yet. But we'll be back, to get more insights into your work, young man. We need you to be in her collection. We do? It could launch you, baby! You know, I probably shouldn't tell you this... I'll suffer for it later. But your work is brilliant. It only takes one or two to buy a painting and... you're made. I gotta hit the head. Don't be long. [sultry saxophone ] What are you doing here? Contributing my time. Doing something worthwhile. I'm a volunteer. You know, when you do sex like this, it's like playing Russian roulette. Sometimes you get lucky. You make your luck. Do you always let your dick rule your life? You're through! Finished...it's over! I don't care how fucking talented you are! [Duran Duran's "Serious" ] [thunderclap] [music fades ] I didn't know you smoked. I don't. Do you remember? Kind of, but I don't remember... You feel okay? Great! Awful! How did this happen?! I don't know. I can't believe it! I mean, the last thing that I need to do... even, even want to do is to get married. You mean, "be married," 'cause that's what you are, you know, you're married! I know, I read the goddamn thing. Maybe it's a joke. [stammering] Maybe it's not real. Maybe we bought it in one of those novelty shops. Nah, we're married. How can we be married? I don't even remember your last name. I know yours, it's McKenzie. It says it right here in this goddamn marriage certificate right there, see? McKenzie. Okay. Okay. I got it. It's simple, it's easy. We made a mistake, that's all. I don't even think we had that much to drink! And we're two mature, grownup adults who can solve this problem. Just like that. [snaps fingers] You mean, divorce? Well, of course! Isn't that what every mature, grownup adult does when they realize that their marriage just doesn't work, huh? Yeah, but you don't have to be so hard on it. I mean, at least we had fun, right? It's more than most people can say after a "bad marriage." Should be easy enough. We get a lawyer, sign papers... Yeah. It'll be like it never happened, right? What the fuck you doing here, Arnie? I own the fucking place, remember? [clear throat] What? Lookit, John, look how loose you look there. You look good! You look good. Look at this one, huh? She's a good one! Come on, all of them! - I like this one! Look at her eyes! She looks good! That one too! - What, this is for a little-- Come on, come on. Everything nice on that one. You're a sleazebag, Arnie. Don't flatter me. Try to do the porno in the nude! Thank God! I told you... I'm not here... you don't come in. That's the deal, okay? Remember? i told you the rent is due on the first. That's another deal we made. Oh, come on. Just bring my plate! You're getting technical on me, Arnie! Come on. Call it whatever you want, but I gotta get my money, or you're gonna get your ass outta here! Come on, Arnie. You can't go on living here like a sultan, Johnny! Living on the beach, looking out at the beautiful ocean, scoring all the best ladies on the shore, and not expect to pay! Come on now, Arnie. Arnie... Arnie, be reasonable, man! What's the matter? You got your arm around me. So what? I don't like it when you put your arm around me. Why not? Because when you put your arm around me, you're usually trying to manipulate me. Come on, Arnie! Take some paintings! Yeah... - Come on, man! Art's what's happening, man! There's big money in it! Don't you read?! - Yeah, I read! Now, you got until tomorrow to get my money or you're out, okay? Arnie! Let me stay until you tear the place down. No! It's not gonna be the same, man. Thank God! Hi ladies. Hi, Jemia! [indistinct] [whispering] John, what are you doing here? Browsing, David. Just looking around. Where's all my stuff?! He told me not to tell you. Tell me what?! They sold, John. They all sold. They all sold?! - Shh! Please, don't tell him I said anything. Romeo, returns! Unscathed by your travail, one would hope! Mark... I'm hungry... How 'bout buying me lunch? Something simple, but trendy... sophisticated... and expensive. [John] I need money. [Mark] How can I give you money? You haven't earned any money. Lend it to me. You know I've already deducted your portion from the auction. And you still owe me over $5000. Well, I'm worth it. I'm good for it. Did you leave with one of the female volunteers? Come on, Mark... [laughing] The guests understood. They did?! They did not! [sighs] The auction went well, didn't it, Mark? You have the nerve to leave with one of the female volunteers after screwing her in my toilet! [John laughing] You're not backing a loser, are you, Mark? All right, let's talk money, here... You love me... You love what I do! When you do it! Which hasn't been very much, of late. Oh come on, give me a break. What do you think, it's a question of just turning a switch on or off? Well, maybe not... But I know this... Nothing is going to happen unless you put yourself in front of a canvass and dare yourself! [sighs] Not to leave with one of the female volunteers. Bravo! How perceptive! How astute! How obnoxious! You know, there oughtta be a law against people like you being involved with artists. You're just another form of pollution, man. Carelessly, recklessly, fucking things up! [radio announcer] A Sig Alert has been announced on the Hollywood Freeway coming through the Cahuenga pass. The one and two lanes are closed and the coroner's on the scene. [John narrating] I tried to avoid going east of Lincoln as much as I could. In fact, I knew people who refused to ever go that far away from the beach, that far inland. [radio announcer] A pilot of a light plane, his companion and two small children were all found dead earlier today. [John narrating] Paul was a friend. Three bodies have been found in a creek near San Bernardino. [John] There was one thing that was clear to each of us... Paulo Mann saying goodbye until tomorrow, 6 a.m. And remember, only you can prevent death and destruction. So beware, take care, and God bless. [John] ...That we would always be there when we needed each other. [John]: You're the good guy. [Paul]: And you're the hero. Listen, uh... We're splitting the expense for the divorce. Hey! What's she like?! Your wife! Oh, Allison? I don't know, I... Hot? - Yeah. I was immediately attracted to her immediate availability. And she, yours, I'm sure. But of course... - Ah, well... You always were an easy lay. Well, you know, I try. Anyway, I told her that I'd pay her back half the money for Las Vegas and the hotel... Generous! Well, it's only fair. And you're totally broke again. Still. That fucking Mark won't deal with me honestly about what's selling, I mean... He's so carried away with this control trip that he's on... How much? What? Do you need? Five or six thousand. Oh.... I-- But I could hold things off for less... Yeah, that's the good news. Can you do it, Paul? Can you help me out again? Yeah, a little bit. Hey! You're lucky that I'm a working schmuck! [John narrating] Working schmuck. That's the way Paul always described himself. It was his destiny, he used to say. Something he inherited from a long blue collar tradition that produced them. He got paid for working at throwing people what they really did need to know. Somehow, he lived a little more freely through his association with me. He always told me, I was a hero. Let me have $100 worth of lottery tickets. You pick the numbers. [smooth jazz ] [John narrating] A pure response... Nothing to stop it. Nothing to think about, really. Nothing to fear. Just hold on... and go along for the ride. [knocking on door] [knocking continues] [knocking gets louder] Final divorce papers! Congratulations, you're a free man. Can I buy you a drink? Yeah sure. Come on in. So where do you want it? The champagne... Oh yeah, here, lemme get that for you. What a nice surprise! Wasn't expecting anyone! I worked late. Yeah? Haven't seen ya in a long time. Nice dress! So where you been hiding, huh? Oh, I've been around. - Hmm? [birds chirping] To marriage. To divorce. Whoop! Ah! [clears throat] Look like you're happy to see me. I wanna paint you. Now. [smooth jazz ] I don't wanna love. We both need the same thing... To be able to forget everything else. The only thing that matters is now. [indistinct] We can lose ourselves right here. Right now. Here's a story about Wally, okay? He's a little frog who likes to eat pussy! I don't wanna hear that! Oh, you'll hear it and you'll like it! [bar chatter continues] John... Hey, it's the girl from the Polaroids! John, I need to talk to you outside. Uh, well come on, have a drink. Arnie, you buying? No, it's important. I gotta talk to you now. Arnie's buying. - No, I don't want a drink. Ohh... I guess I'll see you guys later! [hooting and hollering] Big guy! See you later, big guy! I got it, I got it! Buckle up for safety, man! - Don't take too long! Buckle up, it's dangerous out there! Slippery! So how'd you know I was at the Baja, hmm? You left a note for Melissa on your door. Ooh, yeah, that's right. Don't worry, it's still there. Cool. I'm um... We're pregnant. I knew it. How? I just did. I just thought I'd-- - So what-- Go ahead. - No, you go ahead. I'm the only one. [chuckles] Yeah. [softly] Yeah. [dog barking] So, I guess we just... have it taken care of. Yeah. Okay. Okay... Look, I... I know you have to get back for Melissa, so... I'll have it taken care of. Hey, wait a minute! I'll go with you! Come on, we started this thing together! We might as well finish it together! Hear me?! You can hear me! You can hear me! [bottle spills on ground] [radio announcer] Fires still burn in the Los Padres National Forest, threatening 65 homes, as the wind-swept flames pushed firefighters back in their, what are so far, losing efforts to contain the holocaust. Homeowners in the area are beginning to lose all hope of containment. [John narrating] I wanna set you guys free, but they tell me you'll die. That you can't make it out there in the world anymore. So we're both stuck... I guess. This has gotta be wrong. [woman over intercom] Can I help you? Yeah, I'm sorry to bother you, but I'm looking for McKenzie, Allison McKenzie. Who's calling? John Madler. Does she know you? Yeah, we used to be married! What is this place? It's my family's home. You mean, people actually live here? You actually live here? Yes. Um... You think we could... go some place away from here? Since-- To talk? I was drunk... I know. I meant what I said. I think we need to do this together. All right. Mom... She's pregnant. I can't stop thinking about... you and dad adopting me and... my mother and... and my father. Mom, I wish you were there like you always used to be. I miss you so much. [car horn honking] Let us council you! Please, don't go in there! Murder! You guy are idiots! [door shunts, angry chants continue] [horns and sirens outside] Allison McKenzie?! John Madler? You know we're really-- We're really different. Totally. But this isn't about us... It's about this kid. I know, so how do you think-- Go ahead. No, you, you... No, you. - No, really. [both laughing] Okay! How do we do this? Together, right? I mean, it's not mine and it's not yours. It's ours, right? All right. So we get together... Have this baby... Not to be married... No, no, we won't even act married, no... Just to facilitate the birth of the child and then... What? We'll figure that out when the time comes. It's very important that we do the right thing here. Okay, l mean, we could ruin a very good relationship if we're not careful. But we're smart and we're only doing this because we wanna have this baby, so... Because we can't get rid of it. Well, because we can't get rid of it, yeah. But in any case, we're-- Or, we know who we are... and what we're doing. And as long as we're able to talk to each other and tell each other what's going on, then we should be okay, right? And the ground rules remain the same? Mmm-hmm, exactly. And that's all we want from each other, to have the kid and nothing else? Just to have the kid. No commitments, - No. no dependency... Nothing but the kid. - Right. Exactly. [giggles] Deal. Okay. So, she said, "You're not even married. How can you be having his baby?" And I said... "Mother, it's my baby, too. And besides, we were married, and that's almost the same thing." [John cackling] And then she wanted to know about us having been married... Because apparently, when you came to the house, you said something to Margaret, about us having been married? Yeah? So I said, "No big deal. Things just didn't work out." [both giggle] What's in here? Secrets? Stuff. - Stuff? - Stuff. Okay, Mr. Articulate. I got it! It's not part of the deal. Who's that? That's Oscar. I let him sleep back there and shower when he needs one. You do? - Sure? Real smart, knows a lot about history. [knocking on door] Is that Melissa? Yeah, probably, I wanted to introduce her to the mother of my future child. Some days, you get lucky. Some days, you don't. No, you make your lucky, remember? Saw the truck parked outside, uh, you moving? Allison, this is Arnie Wolfe, he's our landlord. Yeah, we met once briefly at the Baja. This is a nice place you have. Arnie is a money-monger. He's a member of a group of so-called developers that are bent on destroying a way of life down here in Venice. Tearing down a tradition that has spawned artists and creative people for more than half a century. Yeah, you say the nicest things, really. You're the girl from the Polaroids, right? Arnie... - Yeah, you said that before. They seemed to have made a lasting impression on you. Oh yes, that's a horrible understatement. You possess tremendous... accoutrements. - Arnie, Arnie, down boy Allison's gonna be staying here awhile. We're having a baby! - What? We're having a baby. [together] B-A-B-Y. Why? What do you mean, "why?" You guys ever hear of rubbers? The pill? Abortion? AIDS?! Arnie, we got lucky... Anyway, the important thing is, now... You're gonna get at least half your rent every month. 'Cause the mother of my future child has got... M-O-N-E-Y. Is he telling the truth? Yeah well, this is great news. This is reason to celebrate. You guys got any beer? No, but there's some peanut butter back there. Really? Well, I'll take that as well. Tasty libation for everyone. There might be some like, warm milk in there. There it is! What? What? There it is? There it is... What's that mean, "there it is?" There what is? The heartbeat. Right there. Can you see it? That's it. [echoing] No!! Wake up! It's okay, it's okay. What were you dreaming? Why do you want this child? Do you always answer a question with a question? None of this makes any sense! I don't know why we're doing this! Well, let's just say because we can't help ourselves. That's bullshit. We can. Do you want me to leave? I don't know what I want. Look. look! What do you think? Cute! Maybe a little small, though. How do you know? From the crotch. My son's gonna need a lot more room than that to be comfortable. Man! Yeah, well maybe you shoulda tried having a baby with a woman. Maybe. How's it going? Had better days. What is it? It's a painting. Smart ass. I wish I could do that. I wish I had a gift like that. Look, I got you something. Do you like it? Yeah. Why don't you? Why don't I what? Paint. I can't. I don't know how. Here, go ahead! Paint! Do it! No, I can't. I don't know how. Come on, just do it. Come on. - No, are you crazy! Anything! - No! No, I can't. Why? - I don't know how. You're afraid! No. Yeah. Of what? Of what? Beautiful! I love it. [moaning and panting] Hi mom. Mom? Mom, this is Allison. I wanted you to see her. Feel it, mom. The baby. Our baby. Do you ever wonder what this is? No, it's a boy! No, I don't just mean what sex, I mean um... You know, sick or well or normal or abnormal or... Yeah! Yeah? Sometimes I get-- I get scared. [blues rock ] We'd like you to design a visual statement... One that can unite all the various elements of our program, into one cohesive impression. A lasting one of great impact. Why? Because we feel that you could give us something that would be effective in terms of our fight. You guys are at war! There's nothing I can do to help you win. There's nothing any artist can do. You guys need guns, not paintings. [dishes rattling] [pots banging] I can't believe you, guns?! Well good, because it's not up to you to believe me! It's none of your business! Yeah? - Yeah! How can you even say that? This thing, this blind looting of our world is everyone's business! Oh, that's really well-spoken from the lips of a volunteer! Oh yeah, and we met with you volunteering your paintings at auction! To sell 'em! To make me famous! What you're saying is perpetuation of bullshit, man. Because nobody gives a fuck! Yes they do! - Nothing's changing! What else is there?! - Escape! You know how many paintings that van Gogh sold before he died, huh?! One painting! One fucking painting his entire fucking life! - Stop it, stop it! Fuck you! I hate this. [Mark giggling] John?! This is fucking wonderful! Why haven't you shown me this before?! Well, I... I just wasn't ready to go public with it... Yet. You're leaving a mark on him. I'm trying not to. I see a change. It's for the better. your So, uh, I understand you moved here from Bel Aire. Yeah... It's a short ride. You don't happen to have a twin sister, would ya? [both laugh] No, no.... I had a brother that... You don't have to. - No, it's no-- It's okay. He died. [instrumental version of "Silent Night" plays ] I think you guys are brave. I couldn't have a kid. All this shit going on out there... What kinda world is it for a kid to come into anyway, you know? To the baby! [altogether] To the baby!! [female radio interviewer] This is Cheryl Harvey reporting. "John" Wolfgang Amadeus Madler is from Iowa and graduated UC, Berkeley. His father taught art at the local community college and his mother was head of the high school music department. He is considered one of the leading young artists in the Venice colony. [John] I try not to think too much about what I do. Sometimes I feel that thinking is anti-art. The process that I'm involved with is about feelings... freeze-drying them, in a sense. So that they're preserved... Locked in time, as it were... Forever. [screaming and breathing heavily] I'm scared! Oh God, my face is red! It's red, I'm flushed with it! What if something's wrong with it?! It's gonna be horrible! It's gonna be a monster! What do you want? What do you want?! Can you give me anything that I want? What do you need? What do you need? I, I don't wanna feel worthless or purposeless! I don't wanna feel guilty! Tell me what you can't give me! Tell me! Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. No! It's okay. I need to be forgiven. For what? For killing another one! No, this is a permanent deal. It's not part of the deal. It's not allowed! Tell me anyway. Okay. [catching breath] Okay. His name was Donald. And we met in school. At college, and I got pregnant and I had an abortion and um... and he crashed his motorcycle. And he died. You don't wanna know this, do you? You want me to know? I don't know. I wanna know why it can't be easy, though. It just isn't. Never is, babe. You're leaving soon, aren't you? Yeah. Tell me. Some island. South seas maybe. [John exhales sharply] I'm gonna find me a piece of unspoiled paradise. And I'm probably gonna be the last one to use it up. If the baby is all right... Will you love it? I need to create something that I can give myself credit for. I need to create something that I attract credit from myself for. Danger is that... You have to worry about losing something once you have it. [ominous soundtrack ] [no audible dialogue] [] [John narrating] The last month was a blur. We didn't know anything anymore, and stopped trying. The thing that took over was primitive. An existence on the edge with just the imperative of getting to the delivery. We stopped talking about what was about to happen. We became suspended, locked in a vacuum. And we knew that anything and everything that would follow, was completely and utterly out of our control. Let me have $50 dollars worth of lottery tickets. You pick 'em. [Allison yelling] Okay Allison, come on now. Let's push, A little harder now. You can do it. Come on. A little harder. Okay, come on. A little more. One more push and I think we're gonna have the baby. [Allison screaming] - Good! The head is out, don't push. Just breathe now. Just breathe. [panting] This is it, this is it. Come on! [Allison screaming] [baby crying] A beautiful girl! Honey, it's a girl. How can you tell? Dr. Uzi told me. He's got a lot of experience with these kinds of things. What does she look like? Weird, kinda like a rat. Like her dad. Really? Hi. Hi... [baby crying] Oh look. Hi! Yes!! [car engine stalling] Come on, come on, come on! [breathing heavily] [Paul] We have gathered in celebration of death. And in so doing, in celebration of life. For life and death are one. Even as the river flows to the sea, life moves forward and does not tarry with yesterday. And the life before us beckons to great glory as the only memorial that is fitting and just. To everything, there is a season. And a time to every purpose under heaven. A time to be born, and a time to die. A time to get, and a time to lose. Let us seek Helen Madler in ourselves. In the patterns of our minds and memories. In the shape of a world made a little different by her, in the very rhythm of our heart of hearts. To Jennifer! [altogether] To Jennifer! [John] Love to dance, baby. Yeah, that's a good girl. You like to dance. No, don't come around here! I'm not coming around there. Why are you laughing? I wanna know why you're laughing. I wasn't laughing. - Yes you were! No I wasn't. - Yes you were. No I wasn't, I was giggling. Oh uh, okay, you were giggling, fine. Why were you giggling? Because of you. Well I think it had something to do with me. 'Cause you just suddenly looked so silly. So silly. - You're weird. You have a weird mom. You have a weirdo for a mommy. Don't tell her that! Don't tell her that, no! She's weird. No, don't tell her that. - She's a weird little-- Your dad can't help the way that he talks to you. You just bring out the boy in him, don't you? Oh I see, it's a conspiracy, huh? Hey, don't! You said you wouldn't look! I lied. It's remarkable. - You're lying. I don't know much, but I know this... It's nothing, it's just-- - Free... Simple... Unconfused... Honest... - It's nothing! It's everything! [baby cries out] Baby, oh, I'm sorry, sweetie. It's okay. Oh, I know... [baby crying] Hi! You're a dad? Well, I've been called a lot of things... And I am a lot of things, but... Ow! It would be a total inaccuracy if you refer to me as a dad. I sired me some babies, though. Well, so you're just the studly type then? You're just... the love 'em and leave 'em type, huh? Yeah, I guess you could say that. I never been very good at staying around in one place, though. - No, don't pull it! Doesn't it scare you to be alone? Ow! Yeah. Sorry. Don't do that. But uh... I think I like the fear. Makes me feel alive, you know? Makes me feel constantly on the verge of discovering... Ooh, oh! - ...what's next. Don't do that. Sick, huh? - No... I couldn't live like that, though. [doorbell rings] Shit. Wanna keep an eye on Jennifer for me? You bet...it would be my extreme pleasure. Stop crying. - Hello there, sugar. Hello, sugar booger. You smell funny. Yes? Your father and I were concerned about you. Why? Because you're our daughter. Well that's never given you reason enough for concern, has it? May we come in? Um, I'm really kinda busy right now-- Oh, please-- [sighs] Uh... Yeah, yeah, sure. What the hell? You just come on in and I'll have-- I'll have the staff put together a little banquet for you. Brandon, please come in. Brandon, please! Jennifer barfed up all over herself. Oh, look! [baby screaming] I'll guess I'll let you folks get back whatever you-- Uh, we can, we can finish this later. Tell me, uh, that's not him. Who, Oscar? That person, he's... He's not your, uh... Yes, mother, he is. He's our friend. He lives here with us. Tricia, let's leave. But he's not your husband. He's not the father of the baby, is he? No. Not that that's any of your business. Thank God! This is Jennifer! Jennifer, this is your grandmother and your grandfather. They have come here, no doubt, to make sure that we have not deviated too far from the norm, God forbid. Where's your husband? My husband and I are divorced! We got pregnant, in fact, celebrating our divorce! I'm leaving, even if you're not. [sighs] That's right, Bobby, just leave! You always were more remarkable for the things that you didn't say and do, than the things that you fucking did! Your life is an affront to us! An offense! I needed... to come here to see how you were doing. This is not the way you were raised! See how I was doing, mother? Glad to see me? You're punishing us! I'm not going to allow it to happen! Then just leave! They have this thing about males, you know? It's something tribal. And girls, aren't valued as much. You know? So my having a daughter is probably just given them more evidence in their case about how useless... I really am. Any dinosaurs in your neighborhood? They can't hurt me anymore. I know, I can tell. I've never come here before. So much was left unfinished, um... We were separated by only a year, and... We were extremely close. They gave him everything. They gave him... every opportunity and... He was looked at from the beginning as being... the obvious successor. And was looked at from the beginning as being... gifted and talented and... And I was being groomed to be a lady and a wife, you know? And any talents that I had for original thinking or leadership were just, you know, poopooed or discouraged. And uh... They pushed him, they pushed him so hard that he never even made it through his senior year. He killed himself in his senior year in college. Oh, Timmy! Oh God! Timmy! God! [sobbing] I'm so sorry! I'm so sorry for wishing that you weren't there! I just thought that if you weren't there, if you weren't around, that... That they'd finally see me. That they'd... finally focus their attention on me, but... But... I wouldn't win that competition with you. Even after you died, I couldn't. I couldn't. I don't want you to see me like this! Come on, honey. - No! Your baby needs you. - No! No! Okay, okay, okay. Okay. Okay. [synth-pop ] [laughing] What do you want? We got lucky with her. Are you a sicko? Who are you? [echoed] Can you... [reverberated stomping] I knew he would tell you. In fact, I wanted him to tell you. Why, I mean... What did it matter if I knew the paintings sold or they didn't sell? I mean, why the fucking game?! Why not, it got you excited, didn't it? That's important. That's bullshit! You know, you're a sick, manipulating motherfucker! We can settle this problem easily, you know? I'm perfectly willing to tear this up, if you are. What's that?! - Our contract. Listen, you fuck! You're gonna sell my stuff, and you're gonna sell a lot of it! I've had to borrow money from Allison and everybody for everything, including the kid! And that's over, do you understand?! Then give me the nude. I can sell the nude. Ed Morley from Greenscene called again. He's still very interested in getting you involved with them. Yeah? What'd you tell 'em? I told 'em I'd mention it to you. Sounds good. Good? What does that mean? I don't know... It means... good. Well terrific! Why don't you uh... try and figure it out. And when you do, you'll like, break it down to me in English. And I'll call 'em back, okay? Sounds good! I look out here at this world... Our world... And I can see two things... One is, bad. It's rotted, it's decayed. Dying. And the other, the other possessing enormous potential for renewal. Life. And the thing... that separates these two realities, is mingled with, and indistinguishable from everything, It's you... and it's me. And it's nothing more powerful or... fragile than the glimmer of reason. The presence of hope. The blessing of thought. It's a thing called an ideal. [German accent] That's it, Wolfgang! Time time call it a nacht! You fucking call me Wolfgang. It's the only way I know to get you outta here! Come on, it's close-up time! Nobody calls me Wolfgang, except my mother. You fucking hear me?! Yeah, I fucking hear ya! Go home! [waves crashing] [John singing] My girl! [Allison whispering] Be quiet. [John] Oh God. [birds chirping] How 'bout a little cum to start off the new day? I don't cum. What? I never cum. You mean with other men? No, what I mean is... Never. But you came with me. Well, tell me you came when I fucked you! God dammit, tell me! Why?! Because it was important to you. You gotta be kidding me! Wouldn't it make you feel more like a woman? More whole? I don't know. [John sighs] Well, what do you need? Hmm? I can do it. - I don't know. Why not? I don't wanna talk. Why not? - I don't want to! Well, which is it?! Both. It's...important... to me. - You're hurting me! Just-- I don't want this! Just let me go, please! Just let me go! How could you lie to me? I didn't! I swear to God, I just-- I lied myself! You had nothing to do with it. Oh God, help me! [baby cooing] [Paul on radio] And in a related story, it may come as no surprise to anyone out there, that the latest findings indicate that crime-- [car horn blaring] I got your message, Donald. So, you're back? Ah yeah, that was a good one. I think that will do. I'd hate to spill this champagne, it would be really... [radio interviewer] Tell me about your work. [John] It allows me to express myself. It might possibly bring me mortality. [interviewer] Is that important? [John] It is. If what you leave is accurate and can reflect the world that you filled. Can tell if it's good and bad. And maybe suggest where it went wrong, how it did itself in. And how everyone let it happen. Hey crazy, let go of my nose. [toy playing "Frre Jacques" ] [whispering] I'm gonna get you... [baby crying] Come on, come on. [banging on door] Just a little minute! [banging continues] Just a little minute. I got it, man! I got the permit! Yeah! Come on, you wanna go celebrate?! Let's go, it's on me! I'm buying! Johnny, I'm buying! I'm gonna get her a beer! You wanna beer, honey?! Come on, I'm buying! Well... I don't know. I haven't figured it out yet. [clears throat] We can leave... Yeah. They're gonna tear this place down. He gave me 30 days. - Yeah. You knew it as gonna happen. Yeah, it wasn't nothing. Tell me what you want. I don't want to be dependent on you. I can't allow myself to need you. It scares the shit outta me. I-I can't do it. I wanted this baby. And she's mine. She mine and... I feel... I feel good about myself... for the first time... in a long time. And... And there's nothing that you can do that's gonna change that. There's nothing that... I mean, even you're leaving, it won't change that. Okay. Hey, I-I... I wanna propose that we make our lives lovely by being a family, but... I can't! Don't you see that we can't make ourselves right by forcing ourselves on one another, by condescending to... trite emotion that, that... force us to alter our lives and, and... give up our dreams. No, we can't... lose ourselves in the same lie of love that the whole world uses as an excuse for survival. Can we, John? Love is a lie... told in story books... to fuel fantasies... that are destructive... [0123:17:11] and wrong. I had this idea... - Yeah? What if the only news that we found... Well... What if the only news that we told... was good news. That's a fucked idea! It's really fucked! Totally fucked! I mean, that's... That's bad for business. That's fucking impossible. Oh, it's really fucking impossible. You know, it's too bad, too. Because there's a lot of good shit going on out there and nobody ever knows about it because nobody ever tells anybody. That is fucked! - It's really fucked! Let's do it! - What? Let's go! - Where? Fuck it, let's go do it! - Where?! No, let's go to your fucking station and we'll tell 'em all the fucking good news man. - No, we can't. Why?! Why not?! I got no fucking balls. I got no fucking balls! Yeah... I hear you. [Allison narrating] This building being demolished was the best thing that ever happened to us. It forced us to do something, to make a move. There are people who spend their whole lives suspended in fear, waiting for some event to cause them to have to come to grips with reality. But it never does. And they die not knowing if they were where they were because it was easier to drift alone with the tide, like a corked bottle at sea... than to move in a direction of their own choosing. To freedom. Bon voyage! [man singing] Whoa! [both cackling] [thick Chinese accent[ What's a-matter you?! You break my business! Get out! Get out of here! Go! - I'm going... Go! - No, honey... You know me! - We're sorry, we're sorry! Go! No kiss men! No kiss! Stop! - We can-- Why did we come here? Because we came to get lucky! Oh yeah, that's right, we want-- We want five-- I got five dollars and I want five tickets. Lucky tickets! I want five... Five dollar! - Lucky tickets! Lucky tickets! [yelling in Mandarin] "Bi-san" yourself! I'll clean that up if you want! No, it's okay. How you been, baby? [yelling in Mandarin] We came to kiss it. [John screaming] Arigato! Okay! Good night! [heavy metal music ] [baby crying] This would work a lot better for both of us if you would just get it up. [] [phone ringing] [ringing continues] Hello? [Allison] John? Hi. Are you okay? Yeah, I'm great. Um, I was just wondering If um... If you'd like to come by And uh... see Jennifer? Yeah. And uh... maybe take her over night, I know she'd like that. Yeah. She misses you. Me too. [fountain flowing] [Car door slams shut] Mr. Madler. Please, come in. You're beautiful little girl will be ready in just one minute. Thanks, Margaret. - You're welcome. Hi, honey! Hi, sweetie. Aw... Want to give dad a kiss? I think you'll find everything you'll need in the bag. Okay, thank you, thank you. We'll be fine. I'm Allison's mother, Patricia Mackenzie. Hi, I'm Jennifer's father, John Madler. Nice meeting you all. I'll-- Oh, call if you need anything. I will but-- I won't-- We'll-- We'll be fine. Well, nice meeting you all. -Bye -Bye, bye. Say bye. -Goodbye -Goodbye. Oh, yes. Bye. Someday you'll know what's going on... I think. Someday, you'll understand that... You're mother and I needed more to than anything to bring you in to this world. I hope. Someday. [motorcycle revving] [blues rock ] [Allison's voice echoing] Can I have you? [John] You give me mine, and I'll give you yours. [Allison] Oh, you're him. [John] You know, when you do sex like this, It's like playing Russian Roulette. [Allison] Do you always let your dick rule your life? [John] I don't wanna love. [Allison] We both need the same thing... To be able to forget about everything else. We're pregnant. [John] I knew it. Hey wait a minute. I'll go with ya! Can hear me... I know you can hear me! You can hear me! You can hear me! I have to leave her with you. [Baby crying] I'm sorry to bother you! I just-- There's nothing else I could do! What's the matter? Nothing, nothing. I got to catch a flight. I'm leaving. I'm leaving the country! Promise me one thing... Please. Promise me one thing. What is it? That you won't do to her what you did to your daughter. Please, promise me that. What are you talking about? What am I talking about?! I'm talking about the way you made her feel small and unimportant, I'm-- I'm talking about the way that you allowed her to assume... All the guilt, for what happened to your son. I'm talking about the way you, never, ever allowed her to understand how special she is! That's what I mean! Promise me that, lady! Promise me that! Before i leave my daughter with you, promise me, please! Holy-- Please, you gotta work your ass off to make her feel... To let her know how great she is. [blues rock ] Hey, Jack! Let me have a Stoli. Straight up, a double one. And one for the captain. God bless you, my son. God bless you. Gettin' a little late start tonight, huh? Well you know, it's better than no start at all. The world, my son, is like the contents of a bottle. Constantly growing Smaller and smaller... and smaller. Yeah, i'll drink to that. John... Let me have another one just like that. Make that two. John, where's Jennifer? This is my place. What are you doing here? Why did you bring him here? Where is Jennifer. Is she safe? She's with your mother. Is there a problem here? A problem? No, there's no problem, Inspector. We're just conducting a little, business meeting. This is Jennifer's father. John Medler. He's an old friend of mine. Donald-- Donald Walters. Donald? Donald! Why, ain't you dead? I mean, cause that's really funny. Cause i heard, that you fell down on your little bicycle, Got a boo-boo on your head, and you died. What is this asshole talking about? It's a fucking resurrection, Captain! A fucking miracle and it ain't even Easter! Jerry, I got to drink to that. Oh, me too! So, now you're into fucking the dead, huh? Who I fuck, and what I fuck is my business. Is he your way of making you feel good about yourself again, huh? Has he forgiven you? Have you guys forgiven each other? Nice mouth. I think I'm gonna have to shut this mouth. Hey, that's a nice new motorcycle you got there... Did she buy it for you? Son of-- - Take it outside!! Come on, fuckhead! Kick him in the nuts, Johnny! Kick him in the nuts! You know, Allison, you're an easy mark for abuse! Come on! - Oh, I'm coming! I am coming! Start the bike! Allison! - Start it! Start it! - Did he ever find himself after he made you the kid? Huh? Huh?! Stop it! Stop it! Don't hurt him!! Kick him in the nuts! In the nuts! Let go of me! He needs my help! He needs me to help him!! Which one are you talking to?! Stop it! [woman] Someone get some help! [indistinct chatter] God! - What a cheap shot, huh? [party chatter] It's the best thing you've ever done. It's truly remarkable, John. It's gonna spin your career around like a top! I think I'm talking the really big bucks, here! Mark... You're a scumbag. It belongs to Ed Morley and Greenscene. They commissioned it... It's a charitable contribution... A tax write-off. [Oscar] Right?! Don't you see it?! The whole problem with the world today is... We think we know everything! And therefore, we can't learn shit! And on any given issue, any given time, there's only one truth... And it doesn't come in shades and variations. And ultimately it's the only thing that matters. Are those real? Hey, hey! - Are you crazy?! This isn't your lease. These freaks-- These freaks in my place, man! They're gonna mess up the place! Arnie, Arnie, Arnie! The bulldozers are gonna be here in a couple of days. Any damage we do is gonna save you money on the back end! Think of it as good business, man! You been drinking? - Yeah! I think you're right, though. - All right, man. I want you to-- introduce you to... Luella and Susan. This is Arnie. He owns the place. - I own the place. You wanna-- You want a drink, man? Yeah, scotch no ice. Ice spoils the drink. How you girls doing? I own the place-- Friend of [indistinct] down the street. Do a lot of business together. I'm thinking about a lot of exciting things for this area. Gonna tear it down and go about three high. You guys enjoy condos? You ever been down to... John, the radio tomorrow at 12... Tune into the station. I got a surprise for you. Yeah? What is it? It's a secret. It's your going away present. All right. Cool. [party chatter, rock music ] [bird tweeting] Go on now, girls. [smacks cage] Go on! [tweeting] [Paul on radio] Today, I've got some good news for everyone. Instead of the usual stuff, we're gonna talk about some of the other interesting things that're going on in our city. More than 3.5 million people didn't die today in LA. They were not involved in traffic accidents, earthquakes, plane crashes, fires or crime. Now that's what I call "news." [horn blaring] A Hollywood man... What the hell is going on here?! Freddy?! Freddy, what does he think he's doing?! ...dedicated to helping provide housing for the homeless. Jake is on the phone. get him off! - In Pasadena... Paul! - ...a 14-year-old put together a group of teenagers to visit the elderly. To learn from them. To learn to respect them... Paul, I swear to God! A business exec in Century City decided that by pooling the various individual talents of the poor... You did it, you son of a bitch! You did it! ...manufacture profits and well-being for its participants. A retired grandmother decided to fund a group, dedicated to instilling a sense of accomplishment-- Listen, I want this stopped! ...even in the most desperate of our citizens. The balls, man. The beautiful balls! The phones are ringing off the hook! I've never seen anything like this! All right, all right, that's it! Just cut him off! Pull the plug! We're off the air! What are you talking about?! They love it! They're all saying they love what he's saying! I'd like to end this first edition of "The Good News Report" with an excerpt from a letter that was written in 1852 by Chief Sealth, in response to an inquiry made by the US government about buying tribal lands. Chief Sealth said, "The Earth does not belong to man... Man belongs to the Earth. All thing are connected, like the blood that unites us all. Man did not weave the web of life.... He is merely a strand in it. What he does to the web, he does to himself." [knocking on door] Uh, can I come in? [door closes] Something happened the other night when you were-- When John dropped Jennifer. Something important. Allison, I-- I'm sorry. [voice breaking] I'm so sorry. What happened? He loves you so much. It opened my eyes. His love for you made me see-- Mother, what are you talking about? You can't keep living on our terms, because they're wrong. Brandon? There is a phase of our lives... that has to come to an end... as of now. Patricia, you can't change the world in a single conversation. I need more happiness in my life. And so do you. So does our daughter and our granddaughter. Now, we have talked about this... Yes... We talked about it. We're going to fix what's wrong with this family... Once and for all. Your father couldn't understand the difference between... running a corporation... and allowing the love of a family to-- He felt, he couldn't show softness... and vulnerability. This thing about males... is a carry-over from some... distant tradition that your father inherited and foisted upon us. And I let him. Your husband was right. We never worked our asses off to make you feel great about yourself. And that was a terrible mistake. [metal creaking] [glass breaking] I told myself, "Someday. Someday, I'm gonna do it! I'm gonna do it!" But I never did it! You know, because it gets stuck! You get stuck in the rut and then you don't know what to do! We just get stuck! You know what I mean, huh?! You know what I mean? Really what I'm talking about here, huh?! You know what I'm talking about here or what, huh?! [engine shuts down] [waves crashing] Can you believe this?! No, I can't believe it! All right, change it before I miss my flight! I can't! What do you mean you can't?! The spare is flat, too! Great! No, it happened this morning! It happened this morning and I did not have a chance to get it fixed! I mean, whoever heard of two flats in one day, huh?! I mean, sometimes-- Sometimes you just don't get lucky! And sometimes you make your luck! No, I'm not lucky! I'm never lucky! Why?! What did I ever do to you, huh?! Why, why are you doing this to me?! [jet roars overhead] Hey! Hey, hey! What about my fare?! Sometimes... You get what you deserve! You motherfucker! [rock ballad ] [John narrating] This she is, Allison McKenzie... Insecure, deeply unhappy. Not possessed of a great sense of self or self-worth... Capable of buying people off and not admitting that she did it... Scared... Resentful of her situation and her family... Hides in sex, fakes enjoyment of sex. Doesn't cum... So she says... [Allison narrating] There his is... Wolfgang Amadeus Madler... Self-centered, a pushover, scared... overwhelmed by the prospect of the mark he can leave on the world... at the same time, not convinced of the uniqueness of his talents and their value... In love with money and what it can do, in love with sex, and the way it conforms his sense of power and control over things. There he is... running away. Tell me what you want! I want you to stop giving up! [Allison] I want you to become aggressive... Determined to shape your own destiny! I want you to stop being a submissive victim! [John] Oh, look who's talking?! The volunteer! You think the world's a place to go through in camouflage! Always seeking the path of least resistance. I'd rather be a volunteer than a victim. There's a penalty for all this! It's called "being lonely!" Being alone! [John yells, tires squeal] What, are you fucking crazy?! I don't need this shit! I'm by myself! I wanna do something, I do it! I need something, I get it!! It's simple! It's so simple! What are you afraid of? What?! What are you afraid of?! Crazy rich bitches and fancy cars! Why don't you get outta here?! Go back to your dead man! Let him dazzle ya! Let him fuck your brains out! Come on, come on! Being faithful was never part of the deal, you know that! At least I didn't sell a painting that was part of our lives, part of who we are! Did he help you go back?! [horn blaring] Did he help you forget?! Did he help insulate you from the realities of the world?! We all have our fantasies to run to, to escape to! You have your island. You untouched wilderness to use up! Did he make you cum?! [jet soars overhead] Throw your stuff in. I'll take you to the terminal. If I could change the world, you know what I'd do? No, what would you do? I'd get a lot of story books, and I'd research my subject well. And I'd make sure that all the princes and princesses dressed well... And that all the knights ride white horses. And that heaven extended to Earth. And that love was a magic breath that lasted forever. And that lovers who fell madly in love with each other, even if it happened against their wishes and their wills, would be able to admit that they needed each other... And they'd become empowered by each other's presence. And they'd contrive to make the world what they wanted and needed it to be. That's what I'd do. [Pat Benatar's "So Long" ] We can do it. I know we can. Do what? Make heaven on Earth. Need help with your bags?! It can't be done. Together... We could do it together. Yeah, well if you folks get it together enough to decide whether or not you need help with your bags, let me know! Mommy, push me faster! Push me higher! Not too high, Jennifer. Mommy doesn't want you to get hurt, okay? Daddy, daddy, push me higher! You wanna go high? How high you wanna go, baby? John, be careful. - She'll be fine. I wanna go up to the sky and touch the sun. You know-- - I was wondering-- Go ahead! What? No, I want you to go first. Go! - No, you go first. You know, you're always doing this. Go ahead! I want you to go first. I was wondering if you would ever like uh... consider, you know, like ever... getting married again. You know what? - What?! No, it's very funny. What do you mean "funny?" What do you mean it's like "ha ha" funny or peculiar funny? What's so damn funny?! Oh, no it's amazing No, no, I was just um... I was just wondering the exact same thing. Flying!
