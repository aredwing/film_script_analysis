I'll get you an aspirin... It'll soothe you. The car kept going off the road, you know. Maybe it's the steering again. I don't think that new mechanic knows a thing. No... ...it's me. I can't seem to keep my mind on it. I came back ten miles an hour. Took me nearly four hours to get back to Brooklyn. Willy, you've just got to take a rest. You can't continue this way. I've had my vacation this year. But you didn't rest your mind. Your mind is overactive... Your mind is what counts, dear. So beautiful up there, Linda. I was even observing the scenery. Imagine me... on the road every week of my life. The trees were so thick... The sun was so warm I opened the windshield just to let the warm air bathe over me. And all of a sudden I'm goin' off the road! I'm tellin' ya, I absolutely forgot I was driving. Another few seconds... Such thoughts! Most extreme thoughts. Willy, talk to them again. There's no reason why you shouldn't work in New York. No... They don't need me in New York... I'm the New England man... I'm vital in New England. But you're sixty years old, dear... They can't expect you to keep travelling every week. If old man Wagner was alive, I'd've been in charge of New York by now. That man was a prince. But that son of his, that Howard... He don't appreciate. When I went north the first time the Wagner Company didn't know where New England was! Why don't you go down to the place tomorrow and tell Howard you've simply got to work in New York. You're too accommodating, dear. God, I will! I definitely will! Is that the boys? Yes... Happy took Biff on a date tonight. Yeah? He's staying over since it's Biff's first night home. It was so nice to see them shaving together... ...one behind the other, in the bathroom. And going out together. You don't say! Like old times. You notice? The whole house smells of shaving lotion. Willy... Be careful when you talk to Biff... You mustn't lose your temper with him. Have a big evening? Yeah... gave Biff a real homecoming celebration. Pop... we had 2 of the most beautiful... Two very fine types, of course. Hey... what are you doin' back? Oh... I had to come back... They gave me the wrong samples. Hi Biff... You got a line on a job yet? Pop... I just got off the train this morning. Give me a little time, will you. So... have ya made up yer mind to stay... this time? I don't know. - Alright... go back then... be a cowboy. - Willy... please! I'm tryin'... Leave me alone, will ya. Dear bronco-buster! Enjoy yourself. That all ya ever wanna be? Farm hand? Stop worryin' about 'im, Pop... He's gonna be terrific! Get a good night's rest, huh? G'night, mom. You shouldn't've criticised him, dear. Criticised him?... I just asked him a question. Is that a criticism? Theres such an undercurrent in him. He became a moody man. I think if he finds himself, then you'll both be happier and not fight any more. Not finding yourself at the age of 34 is a disgrace! In the beginning, when he was young I thought, well... a young man... its good for him to tramp around... ...take a lot of odd jobs. But its more than ten years now... and he's yet to make $35 a week! The trouble is hes lazy! Willy... please! Why'd he come home again? I'd like to know what brought him home. I think hes still lost. I think hes very lost. Biff Loman is lost! In the greatest country in the world a young man with such personal attractiveness gets lost. Remember how they used to follow him around in high school? When he smiled at one of them their faces lit up. When he walked down the street... Willy! Why don't you open a window in here? They're all open, dear. The way they boxed us in here. Bricks and windows... ...windows and bricks. They shouldve had a law against apartment houses. Theres not a breath of fresh air in the neighborhood. The grass dont grow any more... you cant raise a carrot in the back yard. Remember those two beautiful red oaks out there? When I and Biff hung a swing between them? More and more I think of those days, Linda. This time of year it was lilac and wisteria. What fragrance in this room! They shouldve arrested the builder for cutting down those trees. They should... Go down and get something to eat, dear. Youre my foundation and my support, Linda. Just try to relax, dear. You make mountains out of mole-hills. I wont fight with him any more. Hell find his way. Certain men just dont get started till later in life. Like Thomas Edison... I think. Or B. F. Goodrich. I know one of them was deaf. I'll have a nice talk with him in the morning. I'll get him a job selling. He can be big in no time. Willy... if it's warm on Sunday, we'll drive out in the country. And open the windshield, and take lunch. The windshields dont open on the new cars. Why, you opened it today. Me?... I didnt. Now isnt that peculiar! Isnt that a remarkable thing... That is the most remarkable thing. What, darling? I was thinking of that old sedan... 1928 when we had that green sedan. Funny... You coulda sworn I was driving that car today. Something mustve reminded you. It's remarkable. Remember those days? The way Biff used to polish that car? The dealer refused to believe there was 80,000 miles on it. You go to bed, dear. I'll be right in. Yes, sir, eighty thousand... eighty-two thousand miles! My boy Biff knows how to polish that car! Just a kid... but he puts his heart in his work. One thing about Biff... hes not lazy. How long has that been going on? Biff... I wanted to talk to ya about Pop. Somethin's happenin' to 'im. He... talks to 'imself... Oh, it's gettin' real embarrassin'. They even sent him away on a vacation. What a polishing job, eh? Don't get your sweater dirty, Biff! Why doesn't he stop that? Why does he keep talkin' about ME? I don't know, Biff... I think maybe he's worried, coz you're not settled. You're still kinda up in the air... It preys on his mind. Theres one or two other things depressing him, Happy. What do you mean? Just dont lay it all to me. But I think if you just got started... Well... is there any future for you... out there? Hap... I dont know what the future is. I dont know what Im supposed to want. What do you mean? When I got outta high school, I tried workin' my way up. Shipping clerk, business of some kind or another. And its a measly manner of existence. Yeah, Biff, but tell me... do you really enjoy it or not? On a farm? Take this farm I work down in Texas. Now they got about... 15 new colts. There's nothing more inspiring or beautiful... than the sight of a mare and a new colt. And it's cool there, now, see. And it's spring. And whenever spring comes to where I am I suddenly get the feeling I'm not getting anywhere... What am I doin' playin' around with horses? That's when I come runnin' home. I've always made a point of not wasting my life. and every time I come back here... I know that all Ive done is waste my life. Youre a poet, you know that, Biff? Youre a idealist! Nah... Im mixed up very bad. Maybe I oughta get married. Maybe thats my trouble. Youre a success. Are you content? All I can do now is to wait for the merchandise manager to die. I dont know what in the world Im workin for. Sometimes I sit in my apartment... all alone. And I think of the rent Im payin'... And its crazy. But then, its what I always wanted. My own apartment, a car, and still I'm lonely. Say, I've got an idea... Remember Bill Oliver...? Yeah, sure... Oliver's very big now... Bigger than when you worked for him. Well, when I quit he put his arm on my shoulder, and he said "Biff, if there's ever anything you need, come to me. " I think Ill go to see him. Baby, if we could get ten thousand or even seven thousand dollars we could buy a beautiful ranch. I bet hed back you, Biff, coz he thought highly of you. I mean, they all do. Youre well liked, Biff. I just wonder though. I wonder if Oliver still thinks I stole that carton of basketballs. Oh, he probably forgot that long ago. Its almost ten years. Anyway, he didnt really fire you. Sure... sure. Then, what do you say? We can raise cattle, use our muscles. Men built like we are should be workin' out in the open. "Loman Brothers", huh? We'd be known all over the counties. Yeah, I'd love that bit... that's what I dream about coz everybody around me's so false I'm constantly lowerin' my ideals! With a ranch, we can do the type of work we like and still BE something. You know the trouble is we weren't brought up to grub for money. - I dont know how to do it. - Neither can I! Well then, let's go! The only thing is... what can you make out there? But first I gotta show some of those pompous, self-important executives down at the store that Happy Loman can make the grade. You know when that merchandise manager walks into that store... The waves part in front of him. Thats fifty-two thousand bucks a year coming through those revolving doors... I wanna walk in that store the way he walks in. Then I'll go with ya, Biff... Then I'll go with ya! We'll be together yet, I swear. Too young Biff... too young entirely. Want to watch your schooling first. Certainly know Mom can hear that. Tell the truth, Biff... Did I ever give you a bum steer? Isn't that terrible, Biff? Don't leave again, will ya? You gotta find a job here. You gotta stick around. I don't know what to do about him. You just listen to your father and everything will be alright. But talk to 'im in the morning... will ya? Biff, that will put it in the palm of your hands. We don't want anything to interfere... do we? There's plenty of time to go out with girls... ...when you get outta high school. You know Biff... Girls can be a handicap... Til you're old enough for 'em. And I'd watch those grades first, boy. So... They called you up on the phone, eh? Oh, boy! You must really be making a hit. I been wondering why you polished that car so careful. Don't miss the 'caps! Pad it up Happy... get the chamois to those hubcaps! I'm doing my best, Pa. Gotta use newspaper on the windshield, Pa. That's it, Biff... Show 'im how to do it! Use the newspaper like a pad. Good work, boys. Shine it up til it looks like glass. Usin' the old elbow grease, Pop! Don't forget the inside. How's that, Pop? Good job, gentlemen! Good job! Hold it for a pass, Pop! Comin' at ya! Not bad, eh?! Your old man's another Red Grange. You know if anything ever happened to me you could take right over as captain of the team. Sure! Sure! What's the report, boys? Where'd you go this time, Dad? Gee we were lonesome for you. Lonesome, eh? Missed you every minute. I'll tell you a secret, boys. Don't breathe it to a soul. Someday I'm going to have my own business and I'll never have to leave here anymore. Like Uncle Charley, huh? Bigger than Uncle Charley! Charley's not liked. He's liked... ...but he's not WELL-liked. Heh, where'd you go this time, Dad? Well, I got in the car, and I went north to Providence... I met the Mayor. The Mayor of Providence! He was sitting in the hotel lobby. What'd he say? He said, "Morning!" And I said, "You got a fine city here, Mayor. " Then I bought him a cup of coffee. Oh, boy! And then I went on to Waterbury. Waterbury is a fine city. The famous Waterbury clock. Sold a nice bill there. And then up to Boston... Boston... cradle of the American Revolution! Fine city. Oh, gee... love to go with you some time, Pop. After graduation... next summer. Me too, Pop?... Promise!? You and Hap and I. I'll show you all the towns. America is full of beautiful towns, boys. Fine, upstanding people. And they know me, boys. Know me up and down New England! Carry your bags, Pop? Hey, won't that be somethin'! Me walkin' into the Boston stores with you guys carryin' my bags... What a sensation! Hey, where'd you get the new football? Oh, the coach told me to practice my passing. He gave you the ball, eh? Well... I borrowed it... from the locker room. I want you to return that. I told you Pop wouldn't like you... I'm bringin' it back. He's got to practice with the regulation ball doesn't he? Thought you'd probably congratulate him on his initiative. Oh, he keeps congratulating my initiative all the time Pop. Because he likes ya. If somebody else took that ball, there'd be an uproar. Hey Biff... where you been... You were supposed to study with me today. He's gotta study, Uncle Willy... he's got Regents Examinations next week. Listen Biff, I heard Mr Burnside say if you don't start studying math he's gonna flunk you, and you wont graduate. Tell him, Uncle Willy! Whadda ya talking about? Football scholarships to 3 universities... they're gonna flunk him?! But I heard Mr Burnside say he was gonna flunk... Don't be a pest, Bernard! Take 'im away, Happy! I'll be waiting for you in my house, Biff. What an anaemic! Yeah, Pop! Bernard's not well-liked, is he? He's liked, but he's not WELL-liked, Pop. That's what I mean. Bernard can get the best marks in school, you understand... but when he gets out in the business world... you're gonna be 5 times ahead of 'im. That's why I think having you both built like Adonises... Because the man who makes an appearance in the business world... The man who creates personal interest... The man who gets ahead. Be liked... and you'll never want. How was Providence dear? Did you sell anything? Knocked 'em cold in Providence. Slaughtered 'em in Boston. Oh, that's wonderful! How's my girl? Fine, dear! Just fine! Oh, I'm glad business was so good! Couldn't have been better! 500 gross in Providence! 700 gross in Boston! Oh, that's wonderful! The makes your commission over 200... $212! Well, I didn't figure it yet, it... How much did you do? Well I did about 180 gross in Providence... Well no.. it came to roughly... About 200 gross in the whole trip. You see the trouble is that three of the stores were half-closed for inventory in Boston. Otherwise I'd've broke records! $70... and some pennies... that's very good! Since when do I let my girl carry things when I'm home? Now let's see how much we owe. I'm afraid there's $9.60 on the washing machine... $16 on the refrigerator. Why 16? The fan-belt broke... and that was $1.80 It's brand new! But the man said that's the way they are... They work themselves in. $16!... Jeez. The vacuum... it's $3.50... And with odds and ends including the payment on the car It all comes to around $120... by the 15th. $120! I don't know what I'm gonna do if business don't pick up. Next week you'll do better! Oh, I'll knock 'em dead next week! Yep... very well-liked in Hartford. Only trouble is, Linda... People don't seem to take to me. Oh, don't be foolish. I don't know the reason for it... they just pass me by. I'm not noticed! Why, you're doing very well... You're making between $70 to $100 a week. But I have to be at it 10- 12 hour a day! Other men... I don't know... they do it easier. A man should come in with a few words. One thing about Charlie... He's a man of few words. And they respect him. I talk too much. You're just lively. Well I figure life is short. A couple o' jokes... I joke too much. You don't! I don't know what's the matter with me. Maybe I'm not dressing to advantage. You're the handsomest man in the world! Oh no, Linda. To ME you are! The handsomest! And the boys, Willy... Few men are idolized by their children the way you are. You're the best there is, Linda... You're a pal... you know that? Sometimes on the road... I just want to grab you sometimes and kiss the life out of you. I get so lonely... Especially when business is bad and there's nobody to talk to. There's so much I want to do for... For me?! You're grown up already, Willy. Oh, I'm glad I picked you. You picked me? I did... I've been sitting at that desk watching all the salesmen go by, day in, day out. But you have such a sense of humor... And you and I have such a good time together, don't we? Sure we do... do you have to go now? It's 2 o'clock! My sisters ll be scandalized! When will you be back in Boston? Oh, two weeks about... Will I see you again? Sure thing!... Next time, I'll put you right through to the buyers. Right! - Goodnight! - Keep your pores open! You just kill me, Willy! You just kill me! And thanks for the stockings. You're welcome. I love a lot of stockings. You are, Willy. The handsomest man. You've got no reason to feel that... I'll make it up to you, Linda... There's nothing to make up, darling. You're doing fine... What are you doing mending stockings? They're so expensive... I won't have you mending stockings in this house! Now throw them out! Where's Biff. I've been trying to find him... If he doesn't study... You'll give him the answers! I do, but I can't on a Regents! That's a state exam! They're liable to arrest me! Where is he? I'll whip him, I'll whip him! And he's gotta give back that football, it's not nice. Where is he? Why is he taking everything? He's too fast with the girls... All the mothers are complaining! He's driving the car without a licence! Shut up! Mr. Burnside says if he doesn't buckle down he's gonna flunk math! He's right, Willy... you've gotta do something! There's nothing the matter with him! You want him to be a worm like Bernard? He's got spirit... personality... There's nothing wrong with him! He's givin' it back, isn't he? Why is he stealing? What did I tell him? I never in my life told him anything but decent things. Pop... Take it easy... you don't want to wake up everyone. Why did she have to wax the floors?... She's killing herself! C'mon now Pop... it's gettin' late. Why don't we hit the sack? What are you guys? What are ya? Pop... I told ya... I'm gonna retire you for life! You won't retire me for life on your seventy stinkin' dollars a week! Your women... your car... your apartment... And you'll retire me for life! I couldn't get past Yonkers today! The woods are burning! I can't drive a car! Is everything all right? Yeah, Charley, everything's all right. I heard some noise. It's dangerous living next door. You sneeze in here, and in my house hats blow off. I thought maybe somethin' happened. Nothing happened Charley. C'mon Pop... let's go to bed. You go ahead. I'm not tired at the moment. Take it easy... eh Pop? How about shootin' a little casino? It'll tire you out a little. OK. What are you doin' up? Couldn't sleep good. I had a heartburn. Well, you don't know how to eat. I eat with my mouth. You're ignorant... You gotta know about vitamins and things like that. What is it with those vitamins? They build up your bones. Chemistry. Yeah, but there's no bones in a heartburn. What are you talkin' about? D'you know the first thing about it? Don't get insulted. Well then don't talk about something you don't know anything about. Why didn't I go to Alaska with my brother Ben that time? That man was a genius. That man was success incarnate. What a mistake... he begged me to go. Well I don't see no use... That was a man who started with the clothes on his back and ended up with diamond mines. I'd like to know how he did it. Man knew what he wanted... went out and got it. Walked into a jungle... Comes out at the age of 21, and he's rich. Building. I'd like to take a trip to California. You don't say. I'd need an extra man down at the place. Want a job? I got a job. You know that. Why'd you offer me a job for? I don't see no sense to it... You don't have to go on this way. I got a good job. What do you keep comin' in here for? You want me to go? Charley... I can't figure it. He'll go back to Texas again. Let him go. Forget about him. Then what have I got to remember? You take it too hard. When a deposit bottle is broken you don't get your nickel back. That's easy enough for you to say. That ain't easy for me to say. I'm gettin' awfully tired, Ben. Good, keep playing... you'll sleep better. Did you call me Ben? That's funny... For a second there you reminded me of my brother Ben. Did you ever hear from him since that time he visited a few years ago. Didn't Linda tell you? Couple of weeks ago we got a letter from his wife in Africa. He died. That so? And I never saw him again... Can't make this a very long visit, William... Great many deals pending. Maybe he left you some of his money. Naa, he had seven sons. Just one opportunity I had with that man... There are several rich properties I'm looking at in Alaska. If I'd gone to Alaska with him that time... everything would've been totally different. Ah, you'd've froze to death up there. What're you talking about? Opportunity is tremendous in Alaska, William. I'm surprised you're not up there. Sure, tremendous. Eh? Only man I ever met who knew the answers. Who? How are you all? Fine, fine. Pretty sharp tonight... eh? Is Mother living with you? No... no, she died a long time ago. Who died? Too bad... would've liked to see the old girl. Fine specimen of a lady, Mother. I said... Who died? What are you talking about? William, it's half past eight! I told you I haven't much time. I have to catch a train. Wait! That's my build! I put the ace... If you don't know how to play the game I'm not gonna throw my money away on you! It was my ace, for Petes sake! The next time I'll bring my own deck. With five aces. I don't play that kind of a game. You ought to be ashamed of yourself. Yeah. Ignoramus! Ben! Ben! Ben! I've been waiting for you so long! What's the answer? How did you do it? How'd you become rich and respected? Oh, there's a story in that. Tell me... I was only 3 or 4 years old when you left home. Three years and eleven months. What a memory, Ben! I have many enterprises, William, and I have never kept books. Ben! Why... how do you do my dear? Where've you been all these years? We've talked so much about you... Ben... how'd you do it? How'd you get started? Well I started for Alaska. Due to my youth, I had a very faulty view of geography, William. I discovered after a few days that I was heading due south... So instead of Alaska, I ended up in Africa. The Gold Coast? Principally diamond mines. Diamond mines! I'm sorry William... I must leave you. I have an appointment in Ketchikan Tuesday week. No, Ben! Wait! No Ben, wait... Boys! Boys! This is your Uncle Ben. Great man. Here are my boys, Ben. When I was 17, I walked into the jungle. When I was 21, I walked out... and by George, I was rich. See what I was talkin' about? The greatest things can happen! That's just the way I'm bringin' them up Ben... Rugged... well-liked... all 'round! Oh yeah? Hit that, boy... hard as you can. Come on! Get to me! Go ahead, show him! OK! Good boy! How's that, Ben, eh? Give him a right, Biff... Give him a right! Never fight fair with a stranger, boy. You'll never get out of the jungle that way. It was an honor and a pleasure to meet you, Linda. Have a nice trip. Ben... I don't want you to get the wrong impression about this boy... He's got a great deal on the ball. Biff... Go over where they're building the new apartment house and pick up some 2x4s. We're gonna rebuild the entire garage roof. Watch this Ben. Yes sir, on the double, Hap! And good luck William with your... What DO you do? Selling. Well, there's a living in it I suppose. Too bad you're not more enterprising, William. There's a fortune to be made. Where?... Where, Ben? Africa... Alaska... the world is full of everything. I got the piece, Pop! Nervy boy! Good. Oh, nerves of iron, that Biff... You should've seen the lumber they brought home last week! You shouldn't have let them do it... One day there'll be trouble. I'll stop by on my way back to Africa. Oh... Ben... wait! Ben... my boys... There's so much I have to ask you. They'd go into the jaws of hell for me, see... but I... William... You're being first-rate with your boys. Outstanding, manly chaps! Ben, that's good to hear! Because sometimes I'm afraid I'm not teaching them the right kind of... Ben... how should I teach them? William, when I walked into the jungle, I was seventeen. When I walked out I was twenty-one and, by George, I was rich! "Was rich"!... That's the spirit I want to imbue them with! To walk into a jungle! I was right! Willy. I was right! Don't you want to come inside? Did you get something to eat? It's very late dear... Come to bed. Whatever happened to that diamond watch fob? Remember? When Ben came from Africa that time? Didn't he give me a watch fob with a diamond in it? You pawned it, years ago. To pay for Biffs correspondence course. Gee, that was a beautiful thing. Are you coming in? I need some air. It'd break your neck to see a star around here. That was a beautiful thing. That diamond. What's he doing out there? It'll pass by morning. Shouldn't we do anything? My dear, you should do a lot of things. But there's nothing to do, so go to sleep. I never heard him so loud. Come around more often... and you'll hear him. He's not like this all the time, is he? When you come home he's always the worst. When I come home? When you write you're coming, he's all smiles... He talks about the future... He's just wonderful. The closer you seem to come, the more shaky he gets. Why are you so hateful to one another... Why is that? I'm not hateful, Mom. You no sooner get in the door than you're fighting! Are you home to stay now? I don't know. Mom... I can't take hold. I just can't take hold of some kind of a life. Biff, a man's not a bird... to come and go with the spring-time. Your hair got so gray, Mom. Oh, it's been gray since you were in high school. I just stopped dyeing it, that's all. Well dye it again, will ya? I don't want my pal lookin' old. You're such a boy! You think you can go away for a year and... Biff, You've got to get it through your head that one day you're gonna knock on this door and there'll be strange people here... What are you talkin' about, Mom? You're not even sixty yet. But what about your father? Well, I meant him too. He admires Pop. Biff, if you don't have any feeling for him... then you can't have any feeling for me. Sure I can, Mom. No. You can't just come to see me... Because I love him! He's the dearest man in the world to me... and I won't have anyone making him feel unwanted and low and blue. You've got to make up your mind. There's no leeway anymore. Either he's your father and you pay him that respect... or else you're not to come here anymore. Aren't you gonna clean out the garage? You have to football practice, remember? What's the matter with him? Don't... don't go near him! He's got no character. Charley wouldn't do this. Acting like a lunatic. Not in his own house... Spewing out that vomit from his mind. Then make Charley your father. You can't do that, can you? I don't say he's a great man. Willy Loman never made a lot of money. His name was never in the papers. He's not the finest character that ever was. But he's a human being... and a terrible thing is happening. So attention must be paid. He's not to be allowed to fall into his grave... like an old dog! Attention... Attention must finally be paid to such a person. You called him crazy... I didn't mean... No... A lot of people think he's... lost his balance. But you don't have to be very smart to know what his trouble is. The man is exhausted. Sure. A small man can be just as exhausted as a great man. He works for them 36 years this March... opens up un-heard-of territories to their trademark... and now in his old age they take away his salary. I didn't know that, Mom. You never asked, my dear! Now that you get your spending money someplace else you don't trouble your head with him. For the past 5 weeks he's been on a straight commission. Like a beginner... an unknown. Those ungrateful...! Are they any worse than his sons? When he brought them business when he was young they were glad to see him. But now his old friends... all the old buyers who loved him... and always managed to hand him some order in a pinch... They're all dead, retired. He drives 250 miles to Boston... When he gets there no one knows him anymore. No one welcomes him. What goes through a man's mind driving home without having earned a cent? Why shouldn't he talk to himself? Why? When he has to go to Charley and borrow fifty dollars a week... and pretend to me that it's his pay? How long can that go on? How long? You see what I'm sitting here and waiting for? And you tell me he has no character? The man who never worked a day but for your benefit? When does he get the medal for that? Is this his reward... to turn around at the age of 63... and find his sons, who he loved better than his life... One a philandering bum... Hey... Mom! That's all you are, my baby! And you! What happened to the love you had for him? You were such pals! How you used to talk to him on the phone every night! How lonely he was till he could get home to you! All right, Mom... all right... I'll live here in my room, and I'll get a job. I'll just keep away from him, that's all. No, Biff. You can't stay here and fight all the time. He threw me out of this house. Remember that! Why did he do that? I never knew why. Because I know he's a fake... and he doesn't like anybody around who knows it! Why a fake? In what way? What do you mean? Never mind... Just don't lay it all at my feet. It's between him and me. I'll chip in half my pay check. He'll be all right. I'm going to sleep. He won't be all right. I hate this city and I'm staying. Now what do you want?! He's dying, Biff. He's been trying to kill himself. How? I live from day to day. Last month... I was looking for a fuse... The lights blew, and I went down in the cellar and... Behind the fuse-box... it just happened to fall out. It was a length of rubber pipe... just short. No kiddin'! There was an attachment on the end of it. I knew right away. And sure enough, on the bottom of the water heater... there's a new little nipple on the gas pipe. Oh, that fool! Did you have it taken off? I'm ashamed to. How can I mention it to him? Every day I go down and take away that little rubber pipe. When he comes home, I put it back again. How can I insult him that way? I don't know what to do. I tell you I know every thought in his mind. It sounds so old-fashioned and silly, but... he put his whole life into you... and you've turned your backs on him. Biff, I swear to you... his life is in your hands! All right... It's all settled now. I've been remiss. I know that, Mom. Now I'll stay, and I swear to you, I'll apply myself. Mom, you see I just don't fit in business. Not that I won't try, though. I'll try... and I'll make good. Sure, Biff... sure you will! The trouble with you in business was you never tried to please people. Like when you worked for Harrison's. Bob Harrison said you were tops! Then you go and do some stupid thing like whistlin' whole songs in the elevator, like a comedian. So what? I like to whistle sometimes. You don't raise a guy to a responsible job who whistles in the elevator! Biff, I'll tell you somethin' I hate so say... ...but in the business world, some of 'em think you're crazy. I don't care what the business world thinks! They've laughed at Dad for years, and you know why? Because we don't belong in this nuthouse of a city! We should be on some open plain... mixing cement, or... or carpenters. A carpenter is allowed to whistle! I never in my life whistled in an elevator! Who in the business world thinks I'm crazy? Pop, I didn't mean it like that... Now don't make a big thing of it. They laugh at me, eh? You go into any department store in Boston... Filenes, Slatterys, The Hub... Call out the name Willy Loman and see what happens!... Big shot! - All right, Pop. - Big! All right! Why do you always insult me? I didn't say anything. He just decided to stay! Isn't that wonderful, Pop?... he's settling down... He's goin' to see Bill Oliver tomorrow. Oliver?!... For what? He always said he'd stake me. I'd like to go into business... So maybe I'll take him up on it. That's all. - Isn't that wonderful? - Don't interrupt! What's wonderful about it? There's 50 men in the City of New York who'd stake him. Sporting goods, eh? I guess so. I know something about it... Something! You know sporting goods better than Spalding. So, what's the proposition? Pop... I didn't even see him yet. Then what're you talkin' about? Pop, wait a minute... I got an idea... When I was down in Florida last time I thought of a great idea to sell sporting goods. You and me Biff... we got a line... the Loman Line. We train a couple of weeks, and put on a couple of exhibitions, see? That's an idea, that's a 1 million dollar idea! Wait a minute Pop... we form 2 basketball teams... or 2 water-polo teams and we play each other! It's a million dollars worth of publicity! Displays in all the Hotels "Loman Brothers"... Baby, could we sell sporting goods! Well, I'm in great shape. You guys together could absolutely lick the civilized world. Now tomorrow, when you see Oliver... Don't wear sport jacket and slacks. A business suit, and talk as little as possible... and don't crack any jokes. He did like me. He loved you! Will you stop! Walk in very serious. Money is to pass. Be quiet, fine, and serious. Everybody likes a kidder, but nobody lends him money. And remember, start big and you'll end big. How much you gonna ask for? Gee... I hadn't figured. No, don't say "gee"... Gee is a boy's word. A man walking in for $15,000 does not say "Gee!". Ten, I think, would be top... Don't be so modest. You always started too low. Walk in with a big laugh. Don't look worried. Start off with a couple of your good stories to lighten things up. It's not what you say, but how you say it... Because personality always wins the day. Oliver always had the highest... Don't interrupt when I'm talking. Don't yell at her, will ya Pop? I was talking, wasn't I? I don't like you yelling at her all the time... and I'm tellin' you, that's all. What... are you takin' over this house? I was just gonna say that... Shut up! Will you let me finish? Stop yelling at her, dammit! Don't curse in this house! Since when did you get so clean? Give my best to Bill Oliver... He may remember me. What'd you have to start fighting again? See how sweet he was when you talked hopefully to him. Don't let him go to bed that way. It takes so little to make him happy. Boy, what a woman! They sure broke the mold when they made her. He's off salary... Workin' on commission! I'm gonna go in to Oliver tomorrow and knock him for a loop. That's the talk, Biff! That's the first time I've heard the old confidence out of ya! You're gonna live with me, kid... and any babe you want to meet just say the word and I'll fix you up. Just wanted to say good night to ya, Pop. Now with Oliver... you knock 'im dead boy! And if anything falls off his desk while you're talking to him... like a package or something Don't you pick it up. They have office boys for that. Tell 'im you were in business in the west... not farming. And don't undersell yourself... Not a penny less than $15,000. OK, Pop. Good night, Mom. You got a greatness in you, Biff, remember that. You got all kinds of greatness. Remember that Ebbets Field game... the High School Championship of the city. Try to rest dear When that team came out... he was the tallest... Remember? Oh, yes. And in gold. Like a young god. Representatives from all the colleges... And the buyers I brought... And the cheers when he came out! A star like that... can never really fade! Willy... What has he got against you? I don't want to talk any more Linda. I'm awful tired. Linda! Goes to show ya! They fool ya all the time. Hey! Where'd you come from? I'm getting it ready if you want more coffee. Yeah, there's plenty of time. I'm coming. You know on the way home tonight I'm definitely gonna buy some seed. How about beets to go back in? That'd be wonderful. But not enough sun gets back there. Nothing'll grow any more. You wait, kid... before it's all over I'm gonna build a little place out in the country. And I'll raise some vegetables, a couple of chickens... All I need'd be a little lumber. Some peace of mind. What've you got there? - A ladybug! - I just found it. That's good luck, Willy! Oh, I feel like a million! Fancy me sleeping til 10 on a Tuesday morning! Tell me... How did the boys look when they left? Biff wear his blue suit? It was so thrilling to see them leaving together. Biff was very changed this morning. His whole attitude seemed hopeful. He could hardly wait to get downtown to see Oliver. There are certain men who take longer to get solidified. Good coffee! Best in the world. And you're the best there is. I sewed the lining. Put your glasses in the attachment in your pocket. Willy... when you talk to Howard today... Don't worry, I'll put it to him straight and simple... He's just got to take me off the road. Don't forget to ask him for a little advance because we've got the insurance premium due... It's the grace period now. That's a hundred some odd dollars. $108.68. And you had that motor job on the car. And there's one more payment on the refrigerator... One more payment? But the belt just broke again! I know dear, but it's old. Once in my life, I'd like to own something outright before it's broken! I'm always in a race with the junkyard! I just finished paying for the car and it's on its last legs. The refrigerator consumes belts like a crazy maniac. They time those things so when you finally paid for them, they're used up. Well all told, about $200 would see us through. That includes the last payment on the mortgage. After this payment, the house belongs to us! That is a great thing. To weather a 25-year mortgage is... It's an accomplishment! If Biff would only take it and raise a family here. I'll be home, honey. I forgot! You're supposed to meet them for dinner! Frank's Restaurant... 48th St and 6th Ave. How about you? Just the 3 of you... They're going to blow you to a big meal. Was that Biff's idea? He came to me this morning and said "Tell dad we'll blow him to a big meal!" I'm gonna knock that Howard for a loop. I'll get an advance, and I'll come home with a New York job. Now I'm gonna do it! It's changing, Willy... I can feel it changing! No work on today. Be careful on subways. Carrots'll grow back here too. I'll prove it to you. I'll be with you in a minute. That's my daughter! 7 years old and get that song. What's that? Haven't you ever seen one of these? Wire recorder. Most terrific machine I ever saw in my life. I bought it for dictation... You can record anything you like with it. I had it home last night. Howard... can't we talk for a minute? I'd like to ask a little favour of you. Check this out... This is my son. He said that... "alphabetical order". 5 years old, Willy! He'll make an announcer some day! Wait a minute... the maid kicked the plug out. Certainly is life-like. Howard... A few minutes... the next is my wife. Go on... say something! Well, you gonna talk? I can't think of anything. Well talk... it's turning. Oh, hon... I can't talk into this. That was my wife. That's a wonderful machine. I tell you Willy... This is the most fascinating relaxation I've ever found. Can I get one myself? Sure they only cost $150. You can't do without it. Supposing you wanted to hear Jack Benny, see... But you can't be home at that hour. So you tell the maid to turn on the radio when the Jack Benny program comes on... And this machine automatically goes on with it. When you come home... You can come home any time you like. 12 oclock... 1 oclock... get yourself a Coke... Throw the switch... and there's Jack Benny in the middle of the night. I'm definitely gonna get one... Because a lot of the time I'm on the road, you understand... And I think "What I must be missing on the radio" Say... aren't you supposed to be in Boston? You didn't crack up again did you? Oh no. Had me worried there for a minute. Well, what's the trouble? I've come to a decision. To tell you the truth, Howard, I'd rather not travel any more. Not travel... well, what'll you do? You remember Christmas time when we had the party here. You said you'd try to think of a spot for me right here in town. With us? Sure. Oh... yeah... yeah. Kids are all grown up now... I don't need much any more. If I could take home $65 a week, I could swing it. And speaking frankly... just between the two of us. I'm just a little tired. You're a road man, Willy... we do a road business. If I had a spot for ya, I'd slam ya right in. But I just don't have a single solitary spot. Howard I was with this firm when your father used to carry you in here his arms. I know that. Your father came to me the day you were born and asked me what I thought of the name of "Howard". May he rest in peace. All I need to set my table is $50 a week. But where am I gonna put ya, kid? It isn't a question of whether I can sell merchandise, is it? No, but it's a business, kid, and everybody's gotta pull his own weight. You gotta admit, business is business. Sure, business is definitely business. But I didn't become a salesman just for the money. But I had bigger opportunities. Years ago my brother Ben asked me to go to Alaska and look after his timberlands for him. I'd almost decided to go... when I ran onto a salesman in the Parker House. His name was Dave Singleman. 84 years old, and hed drummed merchandise in 31 states. Old Dave!... Used to go up to his room, yunderstand... put on his green velvet slippers... Ill never forget... Pick up the phone, call the buyers, and without ever leaving his room... At the age of 84, he made a living. When I saw that I realized that selling was the greatest career a man could want. What could be more satisfying than to pick up a phone and be remembered and loved and helped by so many different people? Even when he died, he died the death of a salesman... in his green velvet slippers in the smoker of the 'New York, New Haven & Hartford', goin' into Boston. Hundreds of salesmen and buyers attended his funeral. Things were sad on a lotta trains for months after that. You see in those days there was personality in it, Howard... There was respect, and comradeship... and gratitude in it. Today, its all cut and dried... Theres no chance for bringing friendship to bear... or personality. You see what I mean? They dont know me any more. Thats just the thing, Willy. If I had $40 a week... thats all Id need. $40, Howard! Kid, I cant take blood from a stone... I... All right... The year Al Smith was nominated... - Your father came to me... - I gotta see some people. I'm talking about your father! There were promises made across this desk! I put thirty-four years into this firm and now I cant pay my insurance! You cant eat the orange and throw the peel away... A man's not a piece of fruit! Now look, Willy... pull yourself together! I'll be back. In 1928, your father, right here in this office, he promised me... Mr Wagner... Dont you remember what you told me that time? How you put your hand on my shoulder... Howard! Turn it off! Now look... Willy... I'll get some coffee. Now Willy... look... It's alright... I'll go to Boston. Willy, you can't go to Boston for us. I don't want you to represent us any more. I've been meaning to tell you for a long time now. Howard... Are you... Are you firing me? Well, I think you need a good long rest, Willy. When you feel better, come back... We'll see if we can work something out. I don't earn money, Howard. - I'm in no position... - Where are your sons? Why don't your sons give you a hand? I can't throw myself at my sons. I'm not a cripple! You gotta let me go to Boston! Now look... Willy... I got a line o' people to see this morning. Now take 5 minutes out... get control of yourself... And then go home, will ya!? I need the office. Oh, yeah... Whenever you can this week stop by and drop off your sample cases. Is... Charley there? I'll wait. Charley... you gonna be in the office for a while? I gotta see you, right away. No, won't be long... a few minutes... I'll take the subway. Nothing's working out. No matter how I try. How's a man supposed to live? Family... obligations... Ben... what am I gonna do? Nothing's working out. Things work out William if you know what you're doing. Ben! Ben... how? How, Ben?... How? Ben! There must be some answer! Now let me see, William... I can offer you a great opportunity. I have just bought timberlands in Alaska... valuable timberlands. And I could use a man up there to take care of things for me. Timberland!... What could be better for me and the boys When they finish school they could grow up in the grand outdoors! It's a new continent at your doorstep, William. Get out of these cities... They're full of talk and time payments and courts of law. Screw on your fists and you can fight for a fortune up there. Yes!... Linda! Linda! Hes got a beautiful job right here Youre doing well enough, Willy! Enough for what, my dear? Enough to be happy right here, right now. But Linda, in Alaska... Why must everybody conquer the world? Youre well liked... the boys love you, and someday... Why, old man Wagner told him only the other day that if he keeps it up hell be a member of the firm... Didnt he, Willy? Sure, Ben, I'm building something with this firm. What are you building? Lay your hand on it. Where is it? Theres that man 84 years old... That's right Ben... Dave Singleman... When I look at that man I say "what's there to worry about?" I'm building a position, Ben... a future! It isn't something you can feel in your fingers like timber, Ben. But it's there. I know it is. You take Biff for instance... 18 years old and not a penny to his name and 3 great universities are begging for him. And from there, the sky's the limit. It's not what you do Ben, but who you know... The smile on your face... It's contacts, Ben... contacts! The whole wealth of Alaska passes over the lunch table at the Commodore Hotel. And thats the wonder, the wonder of this country... that a man can end with diamonds on the basis of being well liked! I've got to go William. There's a new continent at your doorstep. Walk out rich. Rich! Ben!... Gotta do it here! I wonder if Biff gets to Ebbets Field... Coming down Beetman's Stairs... All rooting for him. And the representatives from all the colleges... Buyers from the business world too. Coz they'll want him! All be calling for Biff... Loman! You promised me I could carry your helmet! - No, I'm carrying the helmet. - Biff! You promised me! Don't fight!... On a day like this, you don't fight. How'm I gonna get in the locker room without I'm carryin' somethin'? I'm carryin' the helmet! Biff! One of you can carry the shoulder-guard. All this fuss over a baseball game. Charley, how many times do I have to tell you it's the All-Scholastic Football Championship. Oh, really?! Charley, this is no time for kidding. Careful with my flowers! You shouldn't have been so extravagant! Diamonds wouldn't be extravagant for you, Linda. Hey Pop... look! Hey... that's a fine job of printing! University of Virginia?! Pop, I've decided that's where I'm gonna go when I've graduated. Wise decision. Southern schools are always good. Good teams... good mannered. Hey Pop... this afternoon... just for you... I'm gonna break through for a touchdown. Hey, you're supposed to pass. I'm takin' one play for Pop. You watch me, Pop. When I take off my helmet, that means I'm breakin' out. And you watch me crash through that line! Good boy! Hey! Here we are! Ebbets Field! Let's go, Pop! Now remember... You're coming home this afternoon... Captain of the All Scholastic Championship Team of the City of New York. Got it Pop!... And remember, pal... When I take off my helmet, that touchdown is for YOU! Knock a homer, Biff! Knock a homer! I don't think that's funny, Charley. This is the greatest day of his life. Willy, when are you gonna grow up? When this game is over you'll be laughing out the other side of your face... They'll be callin' him another Red Grange. $25,000 a year. Who's Red Grange? Who do you think you are? Better than everybody else, eh? You don't know anything. Put up your hands! What are you walking away for? I'm gonna rip the daylights outta you. Stand there! Hey, buddy, who you talkin' to? Yes? Mr Bernard, is your father in his office? He's in with the accountant checking over some figures. Dad'll be back in a minute. He's very anxious to see him. Alright... I'll be right out. Come in, Uncle Willy. Bernard! Look who's here! Good to see you! What are you doin' here? Oh I just dropped by to see my father and get off my feet til the train leaves. I'm going on to Washington in a few minutes. - Is he in? - He's busy. He'll be back in a minute. Sit down, Uncle Willy. What are you doing in Washington? Oh, I'm arguing a case down there. Is that so? You play tennis, then? I'm staying with a friend who has a court. You don't say! His own tennis court? Must be fine people, I bet. They are... very nice. Dad tells me Biff's in town! Yeah... Biff's in. He's working on a very big deal, Bernard. Hes been doing well in the West. But he decided to establish himself here. Were having dinner. Really, what kind of a deal's he got? Well it's... Bill Oliver... He's a very big sporting goods man. He wants Biff very badly. He called him in from the west... long distance... carte blanche... Special delivery... So your friends have their own private tennis court. You still with the old firm, Willy? Yes, I'm... I'm overjoyed to see how you made the grade, Bernard. Its an encouraging thing to see a young man... It really looks very good for Biff... Very. Bernard... What's the secret? What secret? How did you...? Why didnt he ever catch on? I wouldnt know that, Willy. You're his friend, his boyhood friend. Theres something I have never understood about him. His life ended after that Ebbets Field game. From the age of 18, nothing good ever happened to him. Willy... maybe this is none of my business... Say anything you like, Bernard. I regard you as a very brilliant man. I value your advice. I couldnt advise you, Willy. Theres just one thing Ive always wanted to ask you... Remember when Biff was supposed to graduate high school... and the math teacher flunked him... That teacher ruined his life. He laid down and died like a hammer hit him! No, he didn't! Biff just got very angry... but he was ready to enrol in summer school. He was? Didn't seem beaten by it at all. But then he disappeared from the block for almost a month... I got the idea he'd gone up to New England to see you. Did he have a talk with you then? Willy? Yeah... he came to Boston... What about it? Remember those sneakers Biff used to wear... the ones with the "University of Virginia" printed on them? He was more proud of those than anything in the world... Remember? I remember. And after he came back from Boston he took those sneakers down in the cellar and he was going to burn them up in the furnace. I tried to stop him... we had a fist fight! Lasted at least a half an hour. Just the two of us punching each other down there in the cellar... And crying right through it. Ive often thought how strange it was that I knew when Biff burned up those sneakers hed given up his life. What happened in Boston, Willy? Nothing. What do you mean "What happened?" A boy lays down... it's my fault? Willy, now dont get sore! Well, dont talk to me like that! What does that mean... "What happened?" Son... you're gonna miss that train. - Yeah, Dad. - Oh, hello, Willy. Here, put that in your bag. Thanks, Dad. How do you like this kid!... Gonna argue a case in front of the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court! Good seeing you Uncle Willy... like old times. Don't worry about it... everything's gonna be all right. 'bye, Dad! Knock 'em dead, Bernard! The Supreme Court! And he didn't even mention it. He don't have to... He's gonna do it. You never told him what to do, did you? You never took any interest in him. My salvation is, I never took any interest in anything. Oh... here's some money, Willy... $50. - Charley... look... - I've gotta get back. I've got my insurance to pay... If you can manage it, I need $110. That's an awful lot of money. Oh, I'd draw it from the bank... but then... Linda would know. I'm keepin' strict account, Charley. I'll pay you back every penny. Charley, I'm strapped. I'm strapped. I don't know what to do. Howard just fired me. Howard fired you!? Imagine that! That snotnose! I named him. I named him Howard. Willy, when're you gonna realize those things don't mean anything? You named him Howard, but you can't sell that. The only thing you got in this world is what you can sell. And the funny thing is you're a salesman, and you don't even know that. I've always tried to think otherwise, I guess. I always felt that if a man was impressive, and well liked, that nothing... Why must everybody like you? Why must you always be impressive? I know a man with a lot of money. In a Turkish bath, he looks like a butcher. But with his pockets on, he's very well liked. I know you're not fond of me Willy and nobody could say I'm in love with you. But I'll give you a job. If you want it. And you won't have to go on the road. I just can't work for you, Charley. What, are you jealous of me? I can't work for you, that's all... Don't ask me why. Willy, when are you gonna grow up? You big ignoramus... You say that again, I'll rap you one. I don't care how big you are! You fool, you... You've been jealous of me all your life! Here... Pay your insurance. It's funny, y'know... After all the highways... the trains, and the appointments, and the years... you end up worth more dead than alive. Willy, nobody's worth nothin' dead. Did you hear what I said, Willy? Willy! Apologize to Bernard for me when you see him. I didn't mean to argue with him. He's a fine boy. They're all fine boys and they'll end up big... all of them. Someday they'll all play tennis together. Wish me luck, Charley. Biff seen Bill Oliver today. Good luck. Charley... You're the only friend I got. Isn't that a remarkable thing? Here you are Mr Loman... Just the way you like it. I told the bartender not to use the bar Scotch. That's my boy, Stanley. Tell me, how are the lobsters tonight? Oh... great... great! Then make it three of the best you got. I want 'em with the claws. You better bring some wine, too. It'll put a head on the meal. What, did ya hit a number or somethin'? No, it's a little celebration for my old man. My brother... I think he pulled off a big deal today... We're goin' into business together. Great... great... that's the best for ya... Family business... You know what I mean? Somebody steals... It's in the family! What's the matter? Notice I wasn't lookin' to the right or left, was I? My eyes are closed. How did ya know, Mr Loman? I got radar or somethin'. Stanley! Look at that mouth! Boy, you've got a life, Mr. Loman. Wait on her. Would you like a menu, madam? No, I'm expecting someone but I'd like a... Why don't you bring her... Excuse me, miss... excuse me... Do you mind? I happen to sell champagne.. I'd like you to try my brand... Would you bring her a champagne, Stanley? Sure... sure. That's awfully nice of you. Don't mention it... It's all company money. Would you object to a compliment from a stranger? You ought to be on a magazine cover. I've been on several of them. What did I say before Stanley? You see... she's a cover girl! I can see! I can see! That's a charming product to be selling. Well, gets to be like everythin' else. Sellin' is sellin', y'know. Even my trips to Europe lose their kick after a while. Yes, I suppose. Hi ya, Biff! Hello, kid. Sorry I'm late. Where's Dad? I just got here. Uh, Miss...? Forsythe. Miss Forsythe? This is my brother. His name is Biff. How do you do? Might of heard of him... great football player. Oh really? What team? Are you familiar with football? No, I'm afraid I'm not. Biff is quarterback for the NY Giants. Well... that is nice, isn't it? There we are... champagne. You know what they say in France, don't you? "Champagne is ze drink for ze complexin" I'm happy to meet you. Hey, that's my name... Hap! It's really Harold... But they called me Happy at West Point. Really?! Isn't Dad coming? Do you like her? I don't think there's much chance. Are you kiddin'? Where's the old confidence? Biff... watch this. Honey... Busy? I am. But I could make a phone call. Do that, will ya, honey?! See if you bring a friend for Biff. He's one of the greatest football players in the country. I'll try! Don't try, honey, try hard. Isn't that a shame, now? A beautiful girl like that... That's why I can't get married! There's not one good woman in a thousand... Cut it out, will ya! I want to say something to ya... Did you see Oliver? Hap... I did a terrible thing today. It's been the strangest thing I've ever been through... I'm all numb, I swear. You mean he wouldn't see you? I waited 6 hours for him! Kept sending my name in. But he remembered ya didn't he? Finally, about 5 o'clock he comes out. He didn't remember who I was or anything. Did you tell him my Florida idea? I saw him for 1 minute! How did I ever get the idea I was a salesman... I even believed it myself! Well you were... kind of... I was a shipping clerk. And I didn't quit... he fired me. Oh, he didn't really, Biff! I stole those basketballs, Hap. He gave me one look this afternoon... and I realized what a ridiculous lie my whole life has been! We been livin' in a dream... Yeah... But what did you do then? Well, he... he left, see... and... I was all alone in the waiting room. Hap... I don't know what came over me... The next thing I know, I'm in his office... Panelled walls... everything... I can't explain it, Hap... I took his fountain pen. His... f...?! He didn't catch you? I ran out. I ran down all eleven flights. I ran and ran and ran. But that was awful dumb, Biff! Whatcha do that for? I don't know! I don't know. I had to show 'im. I had to show 'im! I... Now look... You're gonna help me. I wanna tell Pop. What, are you crazy? What do want to go and do that for? No, you gotta tell 'im somethin' nice! Say you got a lunch date with Oliver tomorrow. So what do I do tomorrow? So tomorrow you leave the house see... and then you come back tomorrow night and you say "Oliver's thinkin' it over. " Then Oliver thinks it over for a couple of weeks and gradually it fades away and nobody's the worse. I can't do that. Hap, he's got to understand I'm not the man someone lends that kind of money to. He thinks I been spiting him all these years and it's killing him. He's got to face the facts, Hap. There they are. Haven't been here in years. Hasn't changed a bit. You want a drink, Pop? You sure? Make it Scotch, Stanley... doubles all around. Tell me, boy... everything go all right? Well... I had an experience today... Terrific, Pop! What happened? I want to tell you everything, from first to last... It's been a strange day. Well, I had to wait quite a while for him... Oliver? Yeah, Oliver... All day, as a matter of cold fact. And a lot of instances... facts, Pop... facts about my life came back to me. Now Pop... you remember when I worked for Oliver... Sure I do. Go on. You remember Oliver fired me... and you remember why. I just want to get the facts straight. Now look... Don't give me a lecture on facts or stories about the past... because I'm not interested. The woods are burning, you understand? There's a big blaze going on all around. I was fired today. How could you be? I was fired! And I'm looking for a little good news to tell your mother because the woman has waited and the woman has suffered. The gist of it is that I haven't got a story left in my head. Now what've you got to say to me? Well? Here we are, gentlemen. Three double Scotches. So tell me... What kind of a welcome did he give you? Well, Pop... he... How could they fire you!? I'm out! I'm off! So he gave you a warm welcome, eh? Sure, Pop, sure! Warm welcome. Now that you mention it, Pop... he... Fine... yeah, he gave me a fine welcome. Sure... he... came out very friendly and all you know... Shook hands all around. I was wondering if he'd even remember you. Imagine that... man doesn't see him for 10 or 12 years and gives him that kind of a welcome! No, wait a minute, Pop, it wasn't quite... Do you know why he remembered you? Because you impressed him in those days. Great news, Biff. Did he take you into the office? Or did you talk in the waiting room? He came out first, see... and... What'd he say? What'd he do? Put his arms around you, I bet you, eh? He's a fine man! He's a very hard man to see, you know. I know, Pop. He offered you a drink? No... he.. He had other appointments... he's a very busy man, and... Hard man to see, you know. Then he told him my Florida idea, Pop... Oliver loved it. So he gave you the money? No, Pop!... No!... No! I can't lie to you any more. Oliver didn't give me anything! You insulted him, didn't you?! He didn't even know who I was! You're lying! I'm telling you the truth! Dad... I can't lie to you anymore... I kept sending my name in... He didn't know me... I'm gonna tell you what happened. I won't hear! You're gonna listen to me. I waited 6 hours for 'im, see... All day I kept sending my name in... He wouldn't see me! Finally, about 5 o'clock... Oh, Mom, where's Dad? What happened? I flunked math... Burnside flunked me. I won't graduate. I gotta see Dad right away. He'll be in Boston until Saturday. Boston!... But he's... I'm goin' to Boston. Took the pen and ran! No!... No! Yes! I took the pen and ran! So now I'm all washed up with Oliver... you understand? Are you listening to me? Yeah... sure... If he hadn't flunked math... Flunked math... what are you talkin' about? You stole Oliver's pen! Dad... I just explained it to you. I never intended to do it! Boston Arms Hotel, good evening! I'm not in my room! Dad, what's the matter? Ringing Mr. Loman for you. Dad, I'll make good, I'll find something else, you understand? Now don't worry about anything... Dad! Mr. Loman's room doesn't answer. Shall I page him? No... no... no! Dad, listen... I'm gonna be alright... you'll see... I can still make an impression. It's gonna be terrific Pop... it's gonna be terrific. Biff, you're gonna go back and see Oliver tomorrow. - No, Pop, I can't. - Why not? Oliver fired me years ago for stealing the basketballs... and now I walk in with his fountain pen. That clinches it... Don't you see? I can't face him like that. You don't want to be anything. Is that what's behind it? Don't take it that way. You rotten dog! Are you spiting me? Pop! I'm not spiting you! Can't you understand that? Cut it out now... you're both in a restaurant. C'mon, slugger... forget about it! Atta boy... come on... drink us under the table. Sit down, pal. Willy... will you answer the door?! There's someone at the door. Pop... where ya goin'? The door... where's the door? What door? Washroom. Get away! This is my friend Letta. Hi. She may not be able to stay very long. I've gotta get up early tomorrow. I've got jury duty. Were you ever on a jury? No, but I been in front of 'em! Well, come on girls, sit down, we're wasting time... We'll have a big night tonight. Come on Biff, gather round... what'll we do? Don't you care about him? Hey, what are you talkin' about? Am I the guy who... He doesn't mean anything to you, is that it? You can help him, I can't. Don't you understand what I'm talkin' about? He's gonna kill himself... don't you know that? What do you want me to do? Hap... Help him! Help me Hap help him. I can't bear to look at his face. Willy... aren't you gonna answer the door? I'm not expecting anybody. Willy!... He'll wake up the whole hotel. They've knocked at the wrong door... Stop worrying about it. Make yourself a drink. Why won't you have one? I don't want one. Come on, drummer boy! From now on, I'll see that you go right through to the buyers. No waiting at my desk anymore. Willy... tell him to go away! It's nobody. Yes, Willy, there's somebody out there. It's getting on my nerves. You stay in your room. If it's the hotel clerk, I'll handle it. Now look... don't come out. Biff! What are you doing in Boston? Dad, why didn't you answer? I've been knockin' for 5 minutes. I called you on the phone. I just heard you... I was in the bathroom and had the door closed. Anything happen at home? Dad... I let you down. What do you mean? Dad... What's this all about? Let's go down and get you a malted. Dad... I flunked math! I haven't got enough credits to graduate. I only got a 61. They wouldn't give you the 4 points to pass? Burnside refused absolutely. I begged him, Pop... and he won't give me the points. Pop, you gotta talk to him before they close the school because if he saw the kind of man you are, and if you just... If you just talk to him in your way, I'm sure he'd come through for me. Would you talk to him, Dad... Come on! He'd like you. You know... the way you can talk! Yeah... you're on... We'll drive right back! Good work, Dad! You go down and tell the room clerk I'm checking out. See, the reason he hates me, Pop... one day he was late for class so I got up at the blackboard and I imitated him. I crossed my eyes... I talked with a lithp. The thquare woot of thixty thwee is... I'll bet the kids nearly died laughing! In the middle of it, he walks in! Sounds like you're havin' a swell little party, without little me. That's not very frien'ly. Go back to your room, Miss Francis! This is Miss Francis. She's a buyer... she has the next room. We were just having a business talk. Willy... what's the matter? You heard me, we're through with our business... - But I don't understand.. - Please go back! I'll explain it to you. Well, what about my stockings, Willy... You promised me stockings! I have no stockings here? You had two boxes for me, and I want them! There... now will you get out. - Thanks... don't forget to ring me up... - I will... thanks... fine... goodbye. We better get going now. I want to get to school first thing in the morning. Will you get my things out of the closet and I'll pack my valise. What's the matter? I told you she's a buyer... She buys for J.H.Simmons. You don't imagine...? Alright... get my things. Do as I say! I gave you an order, Biff! Is that what you do, when I give you an order? Biff... When you grow up you'll understand about these things. You mustn't over-emphasise a thing like this. I'll see Burnside first thing in the morning. Never mind. Never mind! He's gonna give you those points... I'll see to it. He wouldn't listen to you. He certainly would. You need those points for U of Virginia. I'm not going there. Even if I can't get him to change that mark... you'll make it up in summer school. You've got all summer to... Oh, my son... be quiet, boy! She's nothing to me Biff. I was lonely... I was terribly lonely. You gave her Mama's stockings! I gave you an order! You liar! You apologize for that! You fake! You phony little fake! You fake! I gave you an order! Come back here or I'll beat you! You hear me? I'll whip you! Come back here or I'll whip you! I gave you an order! I gave you an order! Hey, let's pick it up, c'mon... pick it up, Mr. Loman. Ain't you feeling well, Mr Loman? Yeah, I'm fine. Can you make it all right, Mr Loman? Sure... I can make it. Do I look all right? You look great, Mr Loman, just great. Where are the boys? They left. We're supposed to have dinner together. I guess maybe Mr Happy had to see the girls home. Here's a dollar for you You don't have to, Mr Loman. Your son paid me. You take it.. you're a good boy. Biff! Hey, where you been? I chased ya all over town lookin' for ya. I been right here. And I wasted practically my whole evening. Save it! Mom... What are you doin' up? Here, I brought you some flowers, Mom. Put 'em in your room. What'd you do that for? Don't you care whether he lives or dies? What do you mean? What are you talkin' about? You invite him to dinner... he looks forward to it all day... Then you desert him there. There's no stranger you'd do that to. Deserted him... I hope I don't outlive the day... Shut up! Not another living soul would have had the cruelty to walk out on that man in a restaurant. Is that what he said. He didn't have to say anything. He was so humiliated, he nearly limped when he came in. Pick up this stuff. I'm not your maid anymore. Pick it up, you bum, you! Where is he? I want to talk to him. You're not going near him. Get out of here, both of you. It's sorted all out. I've come to a decision. You're not gonna talk to him. Please! Leave him alone! What's he doing out there? He's planting the garden. Well, there must be something I can do? Must be some solution! She's suffered me! The woman has suffered, you understand me? Biff... She'd be different if we only had something to take hold of. A man has got to add up to something. There IS one proposition. Tell me Ben, tell me! $20,000 on the barrel-head. Guaranteed, gilt-edged. Terrific! Terrific! They might not honor the policy. Impossible. You've paid all your premiums religiously. It's wrong, Ben... it's the wrong thing to do. - It's cowardly. - Why? Does it take more courage to stand here and ring up a zero? I don't know, Ben. Once this house used to be so full of light and comradeship... and good news... And never even let me carry my valises into the house... Polishing that little car... Now... if only I had something to give him... That boy could be so great. William... $20,000 IS something you can feel with the hand. It's there. He might hate me for it, Ben. Why can't I give them something and not have them hate me? I don't know, Ben... I'll have to think it over. Don't waste time, William... It's a sound proposition. Sure I wouldn't be making a fool of myself? Pop! Pop, what are you doing out here? Don't you know there are people all around here? Don't you realise that? Can't see nothin' out here. I'm saying goodbye to you, Pop. I'm not comin' back any more. C'mon and we'll tell Mom. No... I don't want to see it. Why don't you want to see? Don't bother me, will ya. Did you plant, dear? Alright, Mom. We've got it straightened out. I'm going. I'm not writing anymore. I think that's the best way, Willy. Coz it's no use drawing it out... you'll just never get along. If people ask where I am... what I'm doing... You don't know and you don't care. Well, that way it'll be off your minds, and... You can start brightening up again. Alright? Wish me luck? Whatta you say? - Shake his hand, Willy. - Not my hand! I was hopin' not to go this way. Thats the way you're going. Goodbye. May you rot in the earth if you leave this house. I want you to know, on the train, in the mountains, in the valleys... wherever you go, that you cut down your life for spite! No!... No! Spite, spite, is the word of your undoing! And when you're down and out... rotting somewhere beside the railroad tracks... remember, that you killed your own father just as surely as if you stuck a knife in his heart! I'm not killing you! Pop... You want to know what's killing you? It's those phony dreams of yours about all of us being so big and important all the time. We never told the truth for 1 minute in this house. Well now you're gonna hear it. What you are, and what I am! Stop it, Biff... stop it! You know why I had no address for 3 months? I stole suit in Kansas City... and I was in jail. Stop crying, I'm through with this! Quiet! Blame me! I stole myself out of every good job since high school. And I could never get anywhere because you blew me so full of hot air I could never stand taking orders from anybody. I had to be boss-bigshot in 2 weeks! - And I'm through with it! - Then hang yourself! For spite! Willy, I ran down 11 flights with a pen in my hand today and suddenly I stopped. I stopped and I saw the sky. I saw the things I love in this world. The work and the food and the time to sit and smoke. And i looked at this pen, and I said to myself What am I grabbing this for? Why am I trying to become something I don't want to be? What am I doing in an office, Willy? Making a fool of myself when everything I want is out there. Waiting for me... the minute I say "I know who I am. " Why can't I say that, Willy? The door of your life is wide open! Pop... I'm a dime a dozen. - And so are you! - I'm not a dime a dozen! I'm Willy Loman! And you're Biff Loman! I'm one dollar an hour, Willy! I've tried seven states, and I couldn't raise it! A buck an hour! Do you gather my meaning? I'm not a leader of men, Willy, and neither are you. You were never anything but a hard-working drummer who landed in the ash-can. I'm not bringing home any prizes anymore. And you're gonna stop waiting for me to bring them home! You vengeful, spiteful mutt! I'm nothing! I'm nothing, Pop! Can't you understand that? There's no spite in it any more! I'm just... ...what I am, that's all. What're you doing? What're you doing? Will you let me go, please! Will you take that phony dream and burn it? Before something happens? I'll go in the morning. I'm going to bed. He loves you Willy. He always did, Pop. He cried... He cried to me. That boy... Goodnight, Pop. Goodnight, son. Come dear. You go upstairs. I just want to get settled down. Let me alone here for a little while. No, I want ya upstairs. I couldnt sleep right now. You go on... you look awful tired. Come right up? Sure... 2 minutes. Ben! He loves me. Always loved me. Isn't that a remarkable thing. Time, William... time! Willy... you coming up? Coming! It's very smart, dear. You realize that, don't you, sweetheart? Ben's convinced it's the only way. Yeah, I gotta go, baby. Bye bye! Come, William... come with me. Boys'll worship me for this. Willy! Willy... you coming up? Willy! Willy, answer me! A star like that... can never really fade. Think how magnificent that boy is going to be with $20,000 in his pocket. When the mail comes... he'll be ahead of Bernard again! Faster, William... faster! I always knew we were gonna make it. Biff and I. He'll think I'm something for the first time, Ben. The funeral will be massive. They'll come from New Hampshire, Vermont, Massachusetts. All the old timers with the strange license plates. And he'll realise that I'm known, Ben. Willy Loman is known! Remember William... the jungle is dark but full of diamonds. Ben, I'm frightened. One must go in to fetch a diamond out. I need courage, Ben. but it's something you can pick up with the hand and touch. Diamonds! Why didn't anybody come? Where were all the people he knew? It was a very nice funeral. I can't understand it. Especially at this time. First time in 35 years, we were just about free and clear. Let's go, Mom. They'll be closing the gates soon, Linda. I'll be with you in a minute. Go on Charley... I'll stay just for a minute. I never had a chance to say goodbye. Forgive me, Willy... I can't cry. I don't know what it is. But I can't cry. It just seems to me you're away on another trip. I keep expecting you. Willy... Why did you do it? I searched and I searched and I searched. And I can't understand it. I made the last payment on the house today. And there'll be nobody home. You're free and clear! We're free! I know he had the wrong dreams, Biff. But don't blame him. Willy was a salesman. And for a salesman there's no rock-bottom to the life. They don't put a bolt to a nut... He don't tell you the law... Or give you medicine. He's a man way out there in the blue Ridin' on a smile and a shoeshine. And when they start not smilin' back That's an earthquake. And you get yourself a couple of spots on your hat and you're finished. Nobody durst blame this man. The salesman has got a dream, boy. It comes with the territory.
