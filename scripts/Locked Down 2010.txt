Yeah. Come on, come on. Look what you got! Fight back! Come on. Come on. Take him out of here! What do you want? So fuck you, guards! You watch! Another terrible accident in the yard, eh, Kirkman? Convicts are a careless bunch. Bullshit, Vargas! I need some competition! You'll have your challenge, Axl. The best is still to come. Yeah, baby, take it off. Go check the back. I was hoping to buy those 2 kilos and call it a day. You got some balls coming in here like that with no backup. Either that, or you're a fucking cop. We got a deal or what? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Let's see some cash. So what you got for me? Look at that. You have got to try this. Danny... cough if he took the money. I'll pass. No. I mean, you've got to try this. Get that fucking knife out of my face. All units intervene now. We've got a situation. Let's go. Hit it! I'll shove that gun right up your fucking ass! All right, all right. Easy. I'll just cut our buddy here a line. Allow me. You are a fucking cop. Police! Freeze! You're all under arrest! - Hands up! - Hands up! - Hands up! - Right up! Right up! Turn around! Turn around! Go, go, go! Don't shoot! Don't shoot! No! Fucking hang on! - I will. - Don't fucking drop me. Arrest me. Arrest me, but don't fucking drop me. Don't fucking drop me! Stop struggling! Jesus! Pull me up. Pull me the fuck up, man! No! Damn it. Hey, baby. Hey. Wow. Look at you, all cleaned up. I've missed you. I missed you, too. I have dinner reservations at-- I'm not hungry. Not for food. - What's wrong? - Oh, nothing. Just a little bruise. Baby, let me take care of you. All right. Start right now. You okay, Danny? You've been a million miles away all night. I've just got a lot going on right now, Trina, at work. Another assignment? Don't you get any time to be yourself? I mean, you're always somebody else. This time you were a biker, before that a mobster, and what was it before that? I don't know, Trina. I can't remember. How could you? You're somebody else every few months. That's my job. So how do I know when I'm with the real Danny Bolan? You're with him now. Really? Because this one is off who knows where, not here with me, that's for damn sure. The job takes a lot out of you, Trina. It's not something you leave at the office at 5. Yeah. It must be tough, being one person today, someone the next. Lying all the time, it must become a way of life. I don't lie to you. Really? What about when you say you're here for me, Danny? I am here for you. You just got to give me space to do what I do and a little more time. That's all we ever have-- a little. And then it's back to work, and I never know when I'll see you again. Put the weapon on the ground! Down! I'm a cop! Look, I know the drill, all right? Were a cop, Danny. What is this? A fucking SWAT team? Is that really necessary? I know what you're capable of. Lucky suspect-- Mule. He just accidentally fell on his head, I suppose. I tried to save him, but when someone tries to kill me, I defend myself. I don't like the way you work, Bolan. What the fuck are you doing? What is this? This is bullshit, Chief. Shut up. In the mattress? Are you kidding me? How convenient. Somebody fucking planted that, and you know it. You know that's not mine! Of course it isn't. We've had our differences, London, but you know I would never do something like this. I think you've been under too long, Bolan. - Get him out of here. - This is fucking bullshit. Somebody planted that. It's a setup! You know it! Your father was a good cop. What the hell happened to you? Word? Danny Bolan? That's the same motherfucker who locked my cousin King up in Miami. Hey, get up off me, man! Keep still, princess, or I'll pop your hood. You're a fucking dead man, Danny Bolan. I'm gonna fucking kill you, man! Yeah, well, stand in line, motherfucker. Ah, this motherfucker is done. When my fools find out he's in here, it's over. Once the pride of the Stonewall Police Department, Detective Danny Bolan has been convicted of a variety of felonies, including drug trafficking, corruption, and second-degree murder. Bolan will spend a minimum of 25 years behind bars in Blackwater State Penitentiary. Listen up, ladies! You are no longer in the United States of America. This is not a free society. Your rights will be given to you by me, at my discretion. You will eat, sleep, shit, and piss when I tell you to. Understood, fuck monkeys? You all have a lot to learn here at Blackwater. Play by the rules, and you just might get by. If you don't, then I will beat your worthless, dog-shit ass into a pulp. Leave any memories of freedom on the bus... because for some of you... this place is the end of the line. Guard Flores will give you further instruction. Move out now! Man, I'm gonna stuff me a white boy. You can stare a hole through a lot of things. But that ain't one of them. Don't tell me you're the hero cop gone bad? I guess I'm half of that. God damn, of all the-- Look, you just keep the hell away from me. I don't need to be taking no shank meant for you. That shouldn't be a problem, old man. The name is lrving. I said keep your distance, cop. I didn't say you could disrespect me. Fair enough. It works both ways. No, it don't. Respect in the pen, it ain't no human fucking right. It's a privilege, and you got to earn it. You used to fight? Don't touch my shit, cop. Warden wants to see you, Bolan. Get over here, boy. Please, sit down. Sit your ass down, convict. So you were once Detective Danny Bolan. Life for a cop on the inside is usually one thing-- short. Thanks for the advice. Smart-ass cops last half as long. That won't be necessary. You see, Mr. Bolan, I have one objective in running this facility-- that is to maintain a strict and orderly routine day in and day out, which is why your presence here is not a welcome one to me. Now, we will do our best to help ensure your safety, but we're not your private security company. So I'll ask you to do your part in avoiding trouble. I don't want any trouble. What you want, Mr. Bolan, is a moot point. I deal in realities, one of which is that Anton Vargas currently shares the same roof. Now, I know you and he have a history, so you are to stay clear of him at all times. Is that understood? Yes, Warden. Understood. Excellent. Then we're done. Move. Okay, Detective Bolan, we can talk here. I used to be a cop myself. I heard about that frame-up. I want to help. The problem is... if any of the inmates see you getting preferential treatment, they're animals, and they'll come after you. But between you and me, I want you to know I'm gonna do everything I can to make your stay here a living hell. Fuck you! Fuck you! Get up. Get up! Fuck you, you pussy. Fucking coward. Like the warden says, we are not your private security company. Welcome to the fucking jungle. Holy shit. Oh, I got a bad feeling about this. You somebody special? Your own table and all? Like I said, it's all about respect. I've earned mine over the years. And yes, you can sit at my table. Thanks. So you're recovering from your little party with Kirkman? It's going to take a lot more than that to break me. Just deal with what you've got to deal with. Don't bring it on yourself. And I'd stay away from the creamed spinach. No doubt. So what do you know about Anton Vargas? Top dog in here. Crime boss. Runs a fight circuit in the basement. Inmates go at it in a cage, fight sometimes to the death. Big money on it. And the betting goes far beyond the walls of Blackwater. Burke know about this? Vargas has the warden in his pocket. Kirkman, too. How is that possible? Buying off a prison guard is easy. They don't pay them shit. Kirkman-- violent motherfucker. He just flat-out enjoys it. And the warden? You got to understand. Vargas can touch anybody outside these walls. The warden has a family, a wife. and Vargas gets him young ass, which makes Burke pretty vulnerable ifVargas ever decides to put the squeeze on him. You two know each other? You could say that. Irv, what's good? This your new boyfriend? Why, Colton? You miss me? Now look, I ain't got no beef with a tired-ass dirty dreadlocked motherfucker. I got a problem with cops. No beef with me? Talking shit to my face? Little doggie, why don't you go back to your master? Little doggie? Fuck. You hate cops? Well, here I am. Hey. You think you can just mess up my meal and then walk? Whatever you want to do, you old motherfucker. Ain't your fight, lrving. It is now. No. It ain't. Motherfucker! You fucked up now. I'm gonna fuck you up, fresh fish. Get out of here! Get out of my way! You better watch your back everywhere you go! This ain't over! I'm gonna fuck you up, man! Fuck you up! Better watch your back! Better watch your back! You wanted a challenge? There it is on a silver plate. Hey, cop. Chill out, boy. We ain't here to kill you. Yet. That was some major whoop-ass you gave out to that traitor Colton. Righteous, standing up for my man lrving. Do it again, you're dead. You're welcome. My crew would've taken care of Colton. We handle our own people here. That way, things don't get blurry. That's your only warning, pig. Fuck. I seen you got a talking to. Who's that? Name's Rollins. He's the leader of the black gang in here. I'd listen to what the man had to say if I was you. Part of their gang or what? Was. That was a long time ago. Too old for that shit now. But we're still cool. Point is, you ain't one of us. I'll remember that the next time somebody's trying to kick your ass. Take care of your own shit, boy. And find your own people. Everybody in here's got an axe to grind for one reason or another, especially against cops. Yeah, no shit. You got a visitor, Bolan. Five minutes. And you are? Gwen Bauer, lnternal Affairs. I received your request to look into your claims of innocence from the perspective of lA. By who? That's not important. Well, it seems the department has abandoned me or set me up, so I'm surprised you're even here. You should know that we operate separately and objectively from other law enforcement agencies. Are you objective? I like to think so, but of course I'm human. That's good to know. Especially the human part. So you say you are innocent, Mr. Bolan? Does it matter? Police officers may think of us as the Rat Squad, but I'm an officer of the law as well. I went to academy, graduated, and realized that cops need to be watched almost as much as the criminals do. Fact is, lA can help good cops just as much as it can bring the hammer down on the corrupt ones. Which are you? I am, in fact, innocent. It does appear some strings have been pulled in order to lock you up in the very same place where criminals you put away are doing time. What are the chances? I'll be in touch. Wait. Please, Gwen-- Ms. Bauer. Listen to me. As clichd as this may sound, my grandfather was a cop. My father was a cop. He died in the line of duty. This is all I've ever known. It's in my blood. I would never, ever shame my family or the memory of those who passed before me. Believe me when I tell you, I've been framed. If that's true-- if-- I will do everything I can to clear your name and get you the hell out of here. Anton, my man. What's up, dawg? So why the meeting, Rollins? The fights. I hear the wagers are coming in from as far as the East Coast now. Even getting some action out of Canada and Mexico? Absolutely right. My boys and me started this shit back in the day. And your point? I let you take this to the next level, and that little paper you're giving me just ain't gonna cut it anymore, now that there's real money flowing. Let me tell you something. Firstly, you didn't let me do anything. And secondly, I'll give you and your boys whatever I want. So if there's nothing else, end of conversation. Fuck you, Vargas! Kirkman. Doesn't it look like our inmates might be making a break for it? You tell me, Mr. Vargas. Go away. Okay, dog shit. All of you, back inside! Good to be king, baby. Lights out! Hey, man. Thanks for getting me the laundry room gig. No need to thank me. I had my reasons. Yeah? Like what? You know, you shouldn't stand around talking, Danny. It's a good way to lose your new job. Well, thanks anyway, you cantankerous son of a bitch. Hey. Remember me? You put us in this shit hole. Now we're going to fuck you up. Shit, boy. Looks like you got some moves. But I'm gonna get my ass kicked for just protecting myself. Don't worry about it. Them boys covered the cameras. Guards didn't see who was fighting, and these Asians, they ain't going to rat. Why not? Like I keep telling you, Danny. Respect. Keep that warm till I get back. Kirkman. You preparing to start your evening rounds? Yes, sir. Or course you are. In the meantime, I'm concerned that order is at risk here at Blackwater. Everything's under control, sir. Perhaps. But the appearance of control, it's beginning to lack. That is infinitely troubling to me. The fight in the mess hall last week and in the laundry facility today. That does not appear to be order to me, and I can only imagine how it appears to the inmates. I understand, sir. I know Bolan was at the center of the first incident, and I feel confident that he had something to do with the second. Bolan is trouble, Warden. He finds it, or it finds him. I look to you to put an end to these scuffles. I look to you for order, Mr. Kirkman. Keep things contained. Understood? Completely, sir. Carry on with your interrogation. Yeah. I've got you covered. Should be a good fight. Do run, please, fellas. Danny Boy. Long time no see. Anton Vargas. They can't find a hole deep enough to make you disappear. How are you enjoying prison life? Not as much as you. Hell, you know, you get used to your humble surroundings. But we all know it's down to you for our five-star accommodation. A fact of life that never leaves my thoughts. You owe me, Danny. So I want you to fight in my cage. Cage? Yeah. You see, we got a nice little business going on here. See, people want to see men who have nothing to lose fight. And now I have this hero cop and the men that he locked down. Now that's good for business, Danny. I'm not gonna fight for you, Vargas. But I'll be damn happy to fight you. You're in my world now, Danny. Now you got to stop all this scuffling around in the prison. Because, you know, the prison warden will keep you here for the rest of your life. Why don't you be smart? Come fight for me in the cage, and your time here will be very easy. Go fuck yourself, Vargas. The man's made up his mind. And I respect that. Get him out of here. Tell Colton to show Danny Boy what we do to inmates who don't do as they're told around here. That's a Steinhausen. Look after it. Got a message from Vargas. You get every word of that, cop? My name is Dr. Bell. You've been out for a full day. We were getting worried there. Oh, damn. I forgot I got stabbed. You were lucky. If that shiv was an inch higher, I'd be doing an autopsy right now instead. How long do I have to be in here? Think of it as a vacation. Listen. IfVargas wanted you dead, we wouldn't be having this conversation. I'd reconsider his offer. I've put a dozen or so men in body bags who said no to him. Am I the only guy not on his payroll? You're definitely outnumbered, I can tell you that much. I'm just saying, at least in the cage you have a chance. Vargas. Sign me up. I'm going to fight in the cage. Figured as much. When? Next Saturday. Vargas is giving me time to heal. The hell he is. He's gonna use that time to promote the fight. You know who you're fighting? Not yet. Vargas says he's gonna be perfect for my first time out. Tell Vargas I'm in for 5 large. Bolan to win. Hi, big boy. Well, hello. Thank you, Mr. Vargas. Somebody needs a spanking. Fight night! Stop. Move. Come on, Kirkman! Just let us watch. I'll do anything you want. Money talks, bitch. Yeah, baby! Let's do this! ...fucked up! Messed up! I'll murder you! I'll murder the motherfucking cocksucker! Enough! Gentlemen, welcome to the cage. The rules are simple-- they do not exist. The fight will continue until I stop it... or until somebody dies. Understood? What do you want? Bolan is the winner. Let him through. What's up with these? One ofVargas' men left them. Said it was your winnings from last night. Cigarettes? I hate cigarettes. That shit is as good as gold in the joint, man. Shit. I'm sure Vargas doesn't get paid in smokes. Shit, I know he don't. That man makes more coin putting on those fights than some CEOs. What the hell good is cash in here? Nothing, but I'm sure he keeps it in a bank, dumb ass. If he can control his organization from Blackwater, I'm sure he can open a bank account. He's still running his syndicate, for certain? You see the way he runs this place? He may not have the power to overturn his conviction, but believe me he still has a long and dangerous reach, even on the outside. Damn. What? You look like you've seen a ghost. Hey. Your call sounded urgent. Do you know who Anton Vargas is? Yeah. Of course I do. He's in Blackwater, with me, and I'm the one that put him here. That's old news, Danny. What are you getting at? I think it was Vargas that set me up. And you're basing this on what? He has the means and the motive. He was the most powerful mobster in the state before I put him away. I think he's still running his organization from the inside. Okay, first, even if he did somehow manage to frame you, how would he have known you'd be sentenced to Blackwater? You yourself said strings must have been pulled to get me in this damn prison. Vargas practically owns Blackwater. He puts on fights down in the Basement. People die for money. The guards, even the warden look the other way. That's crazy, Danny. You're talking conspiracy theory. I've fought in the cage already. And I'm going to die in it ifVargas has his way. You have to believe me. What do you expect me to do? Vargas laundered his drug money through a network of phony businesses and shell corporations. Get his case file. See if the network's still active. Check if any payments were made to these so-called witnesses that testified against me. Those assets would've been seized as soon as he was convicted. Vargas went down for murder, extortion, racketeering. The list goes on. But he beat the money laundering rap on a technicality. The network may still exist. Okay. I'll see what I can dig up. I'm out of time, Gwen. Yeah? - That's fine. - Here's 60 for Axl. I'll be giving you away. Come on. Okay, then. Okay. Pays 2-1. Hey, boss, here are the numbers for the King fight in Miami. Bigger than ever. They're getting ready to start. I'm gonna show you why I'm king in this motherfucker. Come on. Get up! Get up! I'm gonna smash your shit in. Fuck this! It's my shit! I'm king in this motherfucker! The fights in the cage. I want them to stop. It's too late for that. The cage is an institution. Don't blow smoke up my ass, Vargas. The inmates listen to you here. What is this? Shaking me down for more money? It's getting out of control. Listen. The cage will continue here. Now, I've got franchises around other prisons, and there's nothing you can do about it. Shut it down, or I'll find a way to do it myself. You're obviously not listening to me. So let me put it this way. Barbara takes your two kids to school. Amy and Tyler. Drops them off at Westside Elementary School. Then she picks up a coffee on the way to Pilates, and that's just Tuesdays and Thursdays. Now do you get my drift? Yeah. Good. I'll see myself out. We got a big fight coming up. You might want to wager Axl. Man, this guy's a fucking beast. Is someone getting whacked? Looks that way. Fuck. Holy shit. You see what Axl did in the yard? Yeah. Destroyed two guys in two seconds. And did you see how he did it? That guy's a machine. He used their motion against them. First move was crucial. Took no energy. He was calm. Just watched what was happening, stepped to the side, and bam. It was over. You should be my trainer, lrv. I don't think so. Come on, man. If I got to get back in the cage, I'm going to need all the help I can get. Well, I was an innovator back in the day, and you new martial arts cats, you need to get back to karate, jiu-jitsu, maybe even some aikido. What I'm trying to say is you really need to get back to your roots, then use the best of each discipline. You see? That's exactly what I'm talking about. You're training me already, lrv. You've got another fight coming up, cop. This one won't be a walk in the park. Great. Warden says you can train in the yard-- solo-- 4 hours a day. He wants the fights to be competitive. Not solo. Not without my trainer. That's right. He needs his trainer. You're a trainer? Shit. I'm one of the original Kung Fu brothers from back in the '70s-- Gi, Afro-- the whole 9. Can't you just see it? All right, Blackie Chan. Don't disappoint me. Right, Danny? Fucking asshole. The fundamental principle of self-defense is the ability to strike your opponent in a vulnerable spot as soon as you sense an opening. Think old-school kime-- You want to strike him where it hurts the most. Focus and power. You're mine, motherfucker! You're not my type, sweetheart. Axl. Save it for the fight. There is a concept called mushin, translated from the Japanese, Nomind. Relaxation is a fundamental element of fighting. A relaxed mind, a relaxed body. And your body needs to be relaxed to achieve optimum speed, power, and movement. Breathe. Relax. Hello. Gwen? Yes. Hey, beautiful. I'm just returning your call. Long time no hear. What's happening? I need to call in that favor, Ron. What kind of favor? Access to bank accounts. Go to a judge. I can't. This has to be quick and under the radar. It's going to take time for a court order. Ronnie, who do you think you're talking to, one of your new bubble-headed paralegals? You're the District Attorney. You're a very powerful man. Don't make me say please. I need to see those bank accounts by end of day tomorrow. For me, Ron. My office, 4:30, tomorrow. You know, you're a quick study, kid. You've come a long way with your training. I'm betting my life on it. Thanks for the lessons, lrv. Don't thank me, Danny. I had my reasons. That's what you said about this laundry room job, too. What's up with that? I knew there would be trouble if you were around. I needed the focus to be on you. I don't get it. About 10 years ago, I discovered a soft spot in the wall down there. I've been chipping away at it ever since. But it's difficult to get at. I could only scratch at it during my shift when I got a chance. Eventually, I had to disguise it, cover it up. When are you going to make a break for it? Just waiting for the right moment. Like a distraction. Well, a good fight has always worked for you in the past. That's what I was thinking. Hey, whatever happened to your gym? I signed it over to my daughter before I got collared, just in case. Smart move. Yeah, but from what I hear, the gym is just collecting cobwebs now. At least it's still in the family. Oh, yeah. You got a daughter. What's her name? Elissia. She's almost as old as you are now. Last time I saw her, she was in junior high. Now she has a daughter. Hell, I have a granddaughter. I'm thinking I'll pay them a visit. You have enough money to get there? Me and some boys robbed a couple banks before I got popped. Yeah. I'm one of the few guilty guys in here. You got your cash somewhere secure, I trust. It's in a bag somewhere just waiting for me to tap into it. Well, good luck to you, my friend. Stand to attention, convict. Have you got a problem, officer? I pay you guards good to leave you alone. Get out of those clothes. I thought our date was tomorrow. I am the one giving the orders here. Yes, ma'am. Hey, shit head. You're on. Have a good fight, kid. Thanks, lrving. Just you, cop. I don't fight without my trainer. Kirkman, stop fronting, man. You know Vargas don't want no damaged goods, right? You're lucky you're about to get your ass kicked. Let's go, Moldilocks. It was good. Yeah. On the cop? Yeah. 200. Show time, baby. Show time, baby. Ouch. Fuck. Bolan. Where's your so-called trainer? Probably taking a piss. Old man's got a weak bladder. Gentlemen. I use that term loosely. Welcome to the cage. Fight! Fuck. Keep an eye on the perimeter fence. The fucking mop-head slipped out of the cage area. Fuck you! Well? Kill him. Fuck you, Vargas. Why don't you come down here and fight me yourself? Let me out of here! Now! Let him out. Finish him. Fucking slit! Irv. Stand down. I got the bastard. Do not fire! He works for me, and so do you! Irv! No! Fuck! Escaping prisoner shot. Presumed dead. Will confirm. Kirkman over. No! If I didn't make it out alive and somehow you do, pay a visit to my old gym. Then make sure my daughter and her little girl are taken care of. You owe me for saving your crazy white ass. Irving. My man. These are damning accusations, Ms. Bauer. Where did you get this? I can't tell you that, but it's enough to overturn Danny Bolan's conviction. You want me to believe that the witnesses, some of my own men, were paid off by some mobster in Blackwater to frame Bolan? The ledgers are very clear as to who received money. Witnesses, jurors, a sitting Federal judge. That's ridiculous! It explains how Danny ended up in Blackwater. Leave these here with me. I'll look into it further. We don't have much time. Listen, I know you're a good cop, or you would have never had me look into these claims. Danny is a good cop, too. Don't work too hard, Danny. You got the fight of your life tonight. You're dead, motherfucker. Come on, save it. Plenty of time for that. Did you find out about Anton Vargas? You were right. He paid for those testimonies, and he bribed the judge. I'm glad you know that, Gwen. I didn't want you to think I'm a criminal. What's wrong? I'm fighting a killer tonight-- one of Vargas' men. I'm probably not gonna live through this. Don't do it. Look, I can get you out of there. I have no choice. I just wanted to say goodbye, Gwen. Wait, Danny, don't hang up. W-- London here. I just spoke to Danny. Vargas is going to try and kill him tonight. What? The prisoners, they fight to the death in the basement. Look, you've got to believe me. I do believe you. I've gone over those accounts. Okay, but we've got to do something. I'm going to head over to Blackwater, see if I can get the warden to stop the fight. What if he's in on it? I don't know. Look, I've got to try. I'll assemble an extraction team. We'll meet you there. Gwen, wait for me. Don't-- Gwen. Gwen-- Max, you're killing me. Don't insult me now. Come on. Okay. See you at the fight. You better start working out. We lose this, we're in deep shit. Hey, Danny. I got big money on you tonight-- to win. Kick that motherfucker's ass. Thanks, man. Warden Burke, I need to speak with you. Wow. Vargas has outdone himself this time. Excuse me? What are you, a lawyer? No. A school principal. I was late for school this morning. What the hell are you talking about? This is about Danny Bolan. I know about the underground fights in Blackwater. And I know that Vargas set up Danny to get revenge. I have no idea what you're talking about, Miss, but I suggest you leave this office before I have you arrested. I have proof that Vargas paid everyone off, but I don't have proof against you yet. If you don't stop the fight tonight, you're an accomplice to murder. And you are again? Internal Affairs. I need your help. Yes. Send Flores into my office immediately. Warden Burke, this is your chance to take back your prison. Danny needs to be transferred to another facility because his case is in the process of being overturned. Is that so? Detain her until further notice. What is going on here? How long do you plan on detaining me? You stay here as long as I tell you, princess. Who did you fuck to get this job, Burke or Vargas? Shut your mouth, bitch. Court order. Let us in now. Open the fucking gate. Yeah. Shit. Now we come to the main event of the evening-- the one you've all been waiting for. So which side will you be on? One of your own? Or a stinking rat pig who sent some of you up? Fight! It's over! Didn't I tell you? This is a fight to the death. Get on with it. Holy shit. Do not engage. We're only here to get Bolan. I need to get me one of these. Vargas! You prick. Boys, good. Take it easy, you and your boys. I have enough to make you all rich. Now let me through. Fucking do it. Fucking do it! Danny. Hey. Thanks for stopping by. Jesus. Danny! I brought some friends. I want to help you, old man, but what the hell am I looking for? Oh, damn it. It's in a bag somewhere, just waiting for me to tap into it. That crazy bastard. Okay. So where do we go from here? I'm thinking somewhere warm. I haven't been to the beach in a while. Road trip. All right. Let's get out of here. I'm gonna fucking kill you, Danny Bolan! Do you understand me? I can touch you from the inside! But I'm gonna kill you myself! Do you hear me, Danny Bolan? Do you hear me? Do you hear me? Subtitled By J.R. Media Services, lnc. Burbank, CA
