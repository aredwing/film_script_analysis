God knows what the media buys will be. Millions. More than millions. So we have to do what we have to do. Okay? You can finish the proposal before the holidays... Just pull an all-nighter, you're brilliant at that, okay? Freddie? Freddie? No! No! Not now! What do you mean no service? This is supposed to be sattelite digital. Charles, I need a phone. Hey, honey, there's no cell phones around here. Oh, and what do we owe this casual mood to? You know what? Try five days away from work. Come on. They can't reach you now, but you'll get calls at the resort. Nope, I told the guys upstairs that I am going to Colorado, to Colorado! Come on! You really think that's gonna happen? Whoa, what's this? No, no this can't be happening, come on. There are satellites everywhere. Apparently not here. Where are we? Forty-eight miles from highway eighty-three. Okay my little map-maker. When's the next town? Seventy-three, four, seventy-five miles. What's going on? What are you guys talking about? Where's dad's gross music? How can she be plugged into her own world and then suddenly know that it's quiet in the car? I don't get it. Teenage telepathy. We're lost and we're never gonna find our way. Oh my god, where are we? What's up with all this snow? Where are all the outlet malls? Please, I'm on vacation. Please, I'm on vacation. Dad, Nolan's making fun of me! Nolan. Didn't mom ever tell you they adopted you? Okay, both of you. Okay that's enough. All right? We are the Benson family. We can brave these hardships. I mean, who needs satellite radio? Who needs cell phones? Or CD players or DVD's or ABC's or XYZ's. So sit back. Enjoy the luxury of a well made automobile as we drive... Whoa! Oh... Whoa! All right. Okay, that's fine. All right. Okay. I told you, we should have flown. Is everybody okay? You're okay. I don't like this. Not at all. Can we go now? I don't think we're gonna go anywhere. We're stuck. Do not tell me this. Dad! Okay, everybody, we're fine. It's okay. Someone will... will come along. Oh, someone will come along? It's a paved highway, there's bound to be some traffic. When was the last car you saw? Uh? Where are you going? I'm going outside. I'm gonna check out the damage. Dad, there's wild animals out there. It's nothing. Okay, everybody, just relax. It's fine. It's good. I read that the bears that can't sleep all winter, they hunt for food. Nolan. What? I did. Mountain lions, too. Well, Charlie boy. What are we gonna do now? Now, about that someone will come along... the line you said a while ago. Okay, I cannot miss this party tomorrow night. Dad, do something! I... Listen! What is it? Please be a car with boys! What if it's a serial killer? Mom? Nolan. It's gonna be perfectly fine. Hey you okay? Are you all right? Hi! You folks okay? Yeah, uh, do you know a mechanic? You're lookin' at one. Uh... We need help. Tell ya what, I can drive it back to town, and we'll fix up that later on. Town's still pretty far away? About eight miles, and uh, no use lookin' at your map there, sonny, they stopped puttin it on five years ago. Um, sir, how much do you think it would cost? Cost? Nothin', I'm goin' that way. Oh, what about our luggage? I got lots of room in the back of the truck. Okay. Let's go. Thank you. Thank you. You're welcome, it's cold out here. Just bring what you need. Do you have any, any lattes? Well, welcome to 'Nowhere'. If you've never been to Nowhere, you are now. What happened here? Oh, the coal ran out about five years ago, since then, the town's been slowly dying. Not pretty. I remember a time when you couldn't even find a parking spot on main street. Families walked down the sidewalk, children played around. Hard to believe it was ever like that, huh? That's the only cafe we've got left, you guys can get something to eat in there. All right? So, uh, what about our car? I figure I can get to it by late afternoon. Should have you guys up and runnin' in no time. Okay? So like, is there a mall close by? Just the cafe, young lady. Thanks a lot. Thanks for everything. How can we find ya later? Well, why don't you folks just go in and get something to eat. I will find you, it's a small town. All right, let's go. Thanks! Oh look, just in time for the Christmas pageant. Gross. Why is everybody staring? Um, it's a small town, honey. You know, they're not used to strangers. No kidding. Oh, sit anywhere, folks. Thanks. Do you have a phone? We did till yesterday. Storm broke the line. Can't get in to fix it till the storm calms down a little bit. We have to wait for the car anyway, we might as well eat. I'm hungry. You wanna eat? Okay, let's go. Coffee? Oh, yes. Thank you. I would like a non-fat, half sweet, double shot, rice milk latte. Okay. Coffee with soy milk? Two coffees will be fine. Thanks. We got meatloaf for our special, comes with mashed, vegetables and dessert. Four ninety-five. Um, well I think we're gonna need a few minutes. Oh, we don't have most of what's on the menu anymore. Car trouble? Yeah I saw Coleman bring you here. If anyone can fix it, he can. He knows cars. Anybody who knows Coleman will tell you, he knows cars. Guess he knows cars, huh? And men's hair. I'm sorry, what? Oh, Coleman's also the town's barber. Oh. And if you're gonna stay for a while, we're having our Christmas pageant on Christmas eve. It's gonna be a real hoot. Oh, oh. Well, I think we're gonna be gone by then. Yeah, yeah. Well you can buy some raffle tickets, first prize is $50. Okay. Oh, uh, look at me. You must think I'm pushy. I'm sorry. Oh, no, no. I'm the pageant coordinator, trying to get everyone into the Christmas spirit. We haven't had a pageant around here for almost five years now. Town's had a few bad years. I guess that's obvious, even to city folk. So this year we're going to have a real humdinger of a pageant, if it kills me. Oh look, I have bent your ears long enough, you folks take your time. Boss is in. Gotta look busy. Sam, I thought I told ya. No Christmas pageant this year. Sam, I'm the Mayor of this town and I can't have a poster for a Christmas pageant we can't afford in my cafe. Our cafe, honeykins. You're becoming old and grumpy. Like them. Sam, this town's almost done. There's nothing left in the kitty. What about Christmas? Well, Christmas is for other people. I've got customers. They're not grumpy. Had enough? Aw, yes, I think I'm filled up. How 'bout you, partner? Yes, thank you. Well, you're welcome, cowboy. You know, I'm sorry, but I overheard. Not everyone is so supportive of the pageant, huh? The Mayor was... Ahh, you mean Jeremiah. Yes, yes, he is the Mayor. And my husband. Oh, he's a good man. It's just sometimes life gives you some bad breaks. But we're going to have a Christmas pageant. I've even got all the wives in town buzzing about it. We're gonna have a talent show. Mary-Lou Kinny's girl, she plays the accordion, and the high-school kids have got together some sort of singing act. There's even a gal who's got two trained chickens. And then, of course, there's the dancers. Dancers? Yeah, that sounds like a lot of fun. Well it's not too late to stay over. You can join in! Anyone sing or dance? No, none of us no. We'll probably be on our way. Oh, hello Coleman, I'm just looking after your guests. Thank you very much, Sam. Great! Um, how's it going? Well, I brought your SUV back and it's gonna take four hours or so to fix it. Can't it be faster? Four hours? I might be able to shave off a minute or two, but that's a pretty fancy car you have. I've never worked on one of those before, but as all the folks around town say, Coleman knows cars. Yeah, we heard. We can find something to do for four hours. Thank you. That's the thing. Four hours to fix it, 2 days to get the parts bussed in. Sorry about that, folks. Hey Sam, you got that corned beef on rye for me? This is not what I wanted. Can I sleep in the SUV? There's no other place. It's the only hotel in town. Two days? Dad! Just... Put your stuff down. I don't think there's a remote. Well there's an on switch on the set, so. See? Okay guys, we don't have a choice. Okay? This is the only place. And we're here for who only knows how long. We're never gonna get out. Snow? Find MTV. I don't think they have cable, sweetie. Please, can we go somewhere else? No, no, there's no choice. This is it. This is it. So let's just try and make this as easy as we can, okay? Just... just, if we keep our shoes on and don't use the bathroom, we'll have a good time in here. Oh yeah, candles burnin low, lots of mistletoe. Lots of snow and ice, everywhere we go. Choirs singin' carols, right outside my door. All these things and more. All these things and more. It's what Christmas means to me, my love. It's what Christmas means to me, my love. Oh, yeah And you know what I mean. I see your smilin' face, like I never seen before. Even though... I'll be back as soon as I can. Do you really think you can accomplish anything? I dunno, but I'm gonna try. We're never gonna get outta here. Trish, honey, it's not that bad. My friends are never gonna see me again. I am gonna get us outta here, promise. You okay, bud? Watch this. Daddy, save us. Hey look, I made the picture better. You're actually crazy! We're not related, we're not related! Hey, there. Hey. Got a fresh cup of joe for you. Black, right? Yeah, thank you. You seen Coleman around? He's probably over at the Legion cooking up some grub. We've got some less fortunate families in town. Coleman gathers up some things, prepares some food, gets some presents for the kids, sometimes he even delivers. What like a soup kitchen? I guess you could call it that. Oh he's a good man, that Coleman. He's like that walking spirit of Christmas. Well let's hope it rubs off on the rest of us. Some of the boys have been having a hard time since the mine went south. That's why it seems like the perfect time for a Christmas pageant. You are a one woman chamber of commerce. Ah, the pageant used to be the biggest celebration in town. Everyone came out, even the grouches. We had a parade out there. Once, we even had a movie star. Well, not a really big star, she did some parts in some TV shows, came from Louistown, but... So you really think a pageant's gonna help? Well maybe nothing's gonna really turn this town around, but for this one time, maybe it'd be nice to see some magic again. See some people smile. Well you, uh, got your work cut our for ya. Thank you for the coffee. Where's the Legion? Uh, four doors over and across the street. Can you, give Coleman these cookies for me? Sure. Hold on a sec. Can I uh, can I steal one? Just one. Thank you. Just one, yep! Trish. Mom! Listen, I have to go find a phone. Can I trust you to watch your brother? Like, not really. Nice try. I'm gonna be back as soon as I can. What if something happens? Oh, please. I have a feeling nothing has happened here in a very long time. Nolan, you listen to your sister. Oh, mom! She's the boss. Now look, I'm gonna get you guys outta here as soon as I can and your dad's gonna work something out. And then we'll be on our way. Okay? Be good. Dashing through the snow... Hello? In a one horse open sleigh fields we go Coleman? Hey, Coleman! Hello! Hello. One second there. Let me turn the radio down. How goes it, Mr. Benson? Call me Charles. Yes, Mr. Benson. Special delivery. Oh, great. Look, I was wondering. Maybe there's a, a way to get the parts for my SUV a little faster? I don't think so, Sir, most the delivery of parts are on hold 'til the new year, but they're doing me an exception. Right. First, I gotsta finish this. Oh yeah, Sam told me you're cooking for some disadvantaged people? I don't care to call people disadvantaged, just a little down on their luck is all. And we all can use a little luck can't we? I didn't mean to sound cold... It's really admirable. Can I help? Ah, I guess Nowhere isn't the most exciting place, is it? Well, it... Come on, I got some taters for you to peel. Here they are. Just for you. Okay, there you go. Excellent. And I'll take these over there. Dashing through the snow, in a one horse open sleigh Over the fields we go, laughing all the way Ha, ha, ha! Bells on cobb tails ring Bells on bob tails, on bob tails I'm getting out. Mom said you have to stay here. What are you doing? What does it look like? I'm reading a phone book. Why? You can find all kinds of things. They have a toy store here. Duh, did you not see anything out there? The town is empty. There's no toy store. There's nothing. Mom said... If I stay in this cell any longer, I'm going to scream. You can't just leave me here, I'm a minor. Grab your coat. No. Stop it! Just over in the corner. Oh hey, come on in. How are you holding up? I can't seem to find a phone anywhere. I told you, there isn't one. At least until they get the line fixed. Come on, take a load off. Everyone, this is Annie. She's a visiting for a day or two. Annie, this is everyone. Brittany and Brad, two of our star performers. Mmhmm. And two more of our star performers. Hi. You'll be fine. I wanna go look for the toy store. You gotta stay with me. You could've stayed in the room. I make the rules. That's not fair. Life's not fair. What do you know about life? You're only 5 years older than me. What? Music. I think. Come on. We shouldn't be here. Merry Christmas. How many more people are you expecting? Uh, about twenty more this afternoon. That's a lot for a town this size. Mmmhhmmm. We've been hit hard, Mr. Benson. Merry Christmas. So how did this town get the name of Nowhere? Now that's a good story. The owner of the mining company that used to be here. Yup. Merry Christmas. He brought some investors up here, one of them said this place is in the middle of nowhere. The owner was gonna use his name, he changed it to Nowhere. So he had a sense of humour. Until the coal ran out. Five years ago? Yeah yeah. And there was some other complications too. You see, Sir, there's a lot of coal up there in those mountains. But, it costs too much to mine it. First you gotta start right at the top of the mountain. And you gotta go right to the bottom, very slowly. Not worth it. Anyways, I gotta get this stuff up to Virgil here, at the mine. It gets a little lonely watching that empty place. Care for some company? Sure. Why don't you grab those cookies back there. Okay, let's go Mr.... Charles, really Charles is fine. While I tell of Yuletide treasure, Fa la la la la la la la la. Fa la la la la la la la la Okay, can we go now? Mom said we're not supposed to do this. Look at them, they're so lame. What's so funny? Great comedy act. What do you know about rock and roll? Is that what that was? Seriously? Then why don't you come up here and show us? I'm just watching. Easy to watch. Big city girl thinks she so smart. Big city girl sees flaws. Your beat is way too slow. All of you. And timing is everything. You little drummer boy, what was that? Thirty beats per minute? Try one twenty. And you on the guitar, throw in some power chords and a finger transition in between, I could go on, but I gotta go now. Hey city girl, if you're so smart, show us how to do it right. I don't have time. See, she's all talk. Mom said you're not supposed to do this. First you gotta change that beat. It drives everything. Have a seat. I wanna go back to the hotel. It's boring here. I wanna go back to the hotel room. Mom said. Okay listen. Can you go back to the hotel by yourself? It's only three blocks from here. Promise to stay there 'til mom or dad get back? And if Mom asks? I'll say it was my idea. Okay, straight to the hotel. I could really use your help with this. I mean you must put together events for that big advertising company. Well, uh, I can't do... Oh, no, no... Just watch, okay. Just for a minute or two. And this is our big closer. Come on in, ladies. All right, Sydney. Ready to show her a little of our preview? What do you do? Five, six, seven, eight. That was good. Uh, GOOD! You can be honest. We're tough. We can... It needs work. A lot. Why are you staring at me like that? Well, you get paid thousands of dollars, which means you must know something about everything. Besides, you're probably the only one here who's ever seen a real musical. Uh, there isn't enough time. So you can do it? There is not enough time. But you can do it! Okay. Uh, I think maybe the best thing to do, would be to learn five or six basic steps and then we could put them into sort of a combo. Um, you know what, let's do it together now. Let's do a hip snap and, ready and... One, two, three, good, back, back, snap, go. Where did that come from? Oh, I used to dance like a thousand years ago. You know what? How about the box step? Yeah? Do you know it? Do you wanna learn it? Okay, let's do that. So we're gonna cross with the right foot, in front of the left foot. And ya cross, step back, to the right, and up. Look we're making a box. To back, to the right and up. Good. What happened? Life. You know maybe it was fate that brought you here. Oh I'm pretty sure it was a broken car. Good job, everybody. But I really need to find a phone. Well, here we are. That's a pretty big mountain. This really is in the middle of nowhere, huh? Yes, it sure is. But it makes folks look after each other just a little bit more. Let's go see Virgil. Virgil! Yo, Virgil, we brought you some grub! Did you ever live in the city? Four years. Did you like it? At first... I had a great job on the docks. But after a while I got tired of everybody trying to hide from everybody else. It seemed like folks were trying to get away from each other rather than get to know each other. The whole time I was there, I never met my neighbours. So I moved back to Nowhere, I guess that wasn't such a good choice, was it? Come on, it can't be all that bad, can it? Hhmmm. Well at least I know my neighbours. Yo, Virg, we got some cookies for ya from Sam! Ooops, I think I forgot them back in the truck. Run back and get them for me? Yeah, yeah sure. Virg. Come on out, my man! Coleman! Coleman! Is this some kind of hazing prank you play on city folk. Huh? Hey Coleman, this isn't funny. Coleman! Coleman! Coleman! You okay? This is a first. I'm being rescued by rudolph. You okay, can you sit up? Yeah, cause I just went and got the red ones, so... Where's dad? Oh, um, he's with the barber. Uh, the mechanic. Dad? I don't get it. Yeah, you know Dad. He's probably micro-managing the poor guy's every move. Okay, let's think of something we can all do together. Oh, I kinda have to go somewhere. Where? A bunch of kids are hanging out at the high school, they're working on a project. What kind of project? School stuff. Paper mache, things like that. Oh, okay. Well don't go far, you'll stay in town, right? Like, yes. Okay. And take Nolan. Mom! Fine. Nolan, you get to stick with me. Okay, this fabulous game, can we draw? Tic, tac, toe! So, this is a coal mine, eh? Uh huh. But you're holding, that's just dirt. City slicker, huh? At least I know what to getcha for Christmas. No, no. Don't say it, don't say it. A lump of coal. Okay, that's terrible, that's terrible. Ha ha ha. You know there was a lot of talk around town at one time about turning this mountain into a ski area. But for some reason, it just never got going. Jeremiah, had plans to build a ski lift on top of the mountain, bring in resort planners and everything, but it all fell through when he couldn't get the backing. Now tell me something, how we gonna get out? Mom, I wanna go look around. Nolan, I dunno. Please, I wanna go find some kids to play with. You have your old people, Trish has some friends, Dad's gone. Please? Well, I guess. But Nolan, don't go far. Okay. Hi. sways, kicks. And to the right. Five, six, seven, eight. Here we go. Sway, sway, sway. Back to the left, sway, sway, sway. Step kick, step kick, step kick. Oh, oh, oh! You okay? Yeah, it's just an old injury. Oh, uh, can you tough it out? Okay, okay, she can tough it out. It's very exciting. You have two moves. Aw, hell of a job, Annie. You guys do it. Five, six, seven, eight. This isn't gonna work. Oh I have faith in us. And you. Did you... Uh... What? Did you ever make it to the big time? Kind of. Once, I was fourth on the left. Broadway. Oh, Sam, it was big, it was really, really big. It was like I was on top of the mountain, I was just looking down. Yeah, but you know. Life. I mean things are never easy. I mean not for anybody. My mother always said, life doesn't change you, you change it. Obviously your mother was not in advertising. Uh, well, you here to audition? I thought I made it clear, there's not going to be a Christmas pageant this year. And I thought I made it clear that there was. Sam... You tell these women to go back to their homes and do what wives are supposed to do. Don't start that with me, Jeremiah. The town can't afford it! And the men folk don't want it either. They've all got problems of their own, they don't need to be reminded of how bad things are. Maybe that's why we need this. To take their minds off of how bad things are. I'm gonna put an end to this silly thing once and for all. Mark my words, Ladies. There won't be a Christmas pageant this year. Or ever again. So, where were we. We had a little sway. What, you wanna do it? Absolutely! Okay. We're gonna do it. We're gonna do our grapevines, we're gonna do our kicks. We're gonna add more moves! Everybody ready? Yes! Music! Five, six, seven, eight. To the right. Sway, sway, sway. And to the left. Sway, sway, sway. And step kick, step kick, step kick, step kick. Are you ready to just keep goin', cause we're gonna do a turn right now. Go. And up and... Okay... Whoa, whoa, you all right? You're gonna have to tell me how this is gonna work. Uh, uh it's a block and tackle. Um, like an engine hoist. There ya go, other foot. Where'd you learn this? Sailing school. I got a forty-foot schooner back at home. All right. Okay, I need you to hang in there. Okay. I need ya to help me out. All right. Stay there. Okay, okay, wait, wait, wait, wait. What? I'm gonna need some music. You what? Music! It'll help distract me from the pain. I don't have any music. Can't you sing something. No, I don't sing. Stop! Uh, uh, uh, uh, I'm sorry, I... This is private property, what are you doing here? I, my mom, and Trisha says I... And my dad's car I... And my dad's car, I... Will ya just relax. Take it easy, kid. I'm sorry, I've just never seen a train like this before. Well this here is a nineteen forty-one Burlington Silverstreak Zephyr. Number thirty-nine of fifty. Um, it's worth more than you can imagine. Not for kids. But this is a toy store and toys are for kids. It ain't anything anymore. Look, you better leave, this is private property! Go on! Kid, would you get outta here! Now! It's a toy store, and toys are for kids! Smile, you need to smile. Real smiles. Better, but you've got just twenty-four hours to get it perfect. You're really pushin' us. You wanna be good? Why did you quit singing lessons, anyway? It stopped being fun. My mom pushed me too much. She was gonna be a dancer a long time ago, she even made it to Broadway. So what happened? Me, then my brother. So, she gave it all up and now she wants to live through you? She doesn't have time for it. But she wants me to have all the opportunities she didn't. And not have regrets. Everybody has regrets. Adults have more because they've been around longer. Whatever. Come on you guys, let's get this down. One, two, three and... I know it's none of my business. But. I think you need to have your pageant. You can see it, huh? It's not the town that's dying, it's them. They're giving up. Why can't they figure that out? Maybe they're afraid. Don't have a Santa Claus yet? Can't have Christmas without Santa Claus. Maybe that's what Mr. B needs. We haven't had a Santa in a long time, Nolan. I don't think he's gonna find us again. Santa Claus sometimes get lost, but he never forgets anyone. You're a pretty smart guy, Nolan. Every kid knows that Santa always shows up. Maybe someone just has to remind him. What do you think? The show must go on. Jeremiah. Oh, I can handle him. Come on, Nolan, you can help. I have to finish my milkshake, Mom. Be on your best behaviour? I will. seven, eight. And point. Okay. All right, good job. Take a break. Take a break. You know what, I want you to put some ice on that knee. It looks like we got a complete show. Well, except for one thing. Santa. Oh, we had one fella, the perfect choice. So? He, yeah, no he can't do it anymore. You don't wanna ask Jeremiah about it. Ladies! As Mayor of Nowhere, I am shuttin' this show down. You can't just do that. I can and I am. Well we're just gonna find someplace else. Figured as much. But it turns out you're all in violation of a town bi-law that requires an application for a permit to allow a gathering of the political purposes within town limits. You can have your Christmas pageant, outside of town limits. But there's nowhere else to do it but the high school. I guess you're closed down then. Come on, ladies, break it up! Come on, go on home where you belong! Let's go, boys. Jeremiah, I am warning you. Sam, dinner hour's coming up. You better be ready. No, these ladies aren't going anywhere. Ma'am, you're not from here and I suggest you stay outta this. People just wanna do something for the town, look at these ladies, they're dancers! You have singers and a chicken handler. And all they wanna do is get up on the stage and do what they do best, to get your town up on it's feet, for one night. You can't cancel that. Ma'am, you don't know nothin'. I know that this town is more than just you. And more than your grumpy friends too. People need hope. Hope. Nowhere's all outta hope. You don't think we've tried? I've gone to every bank within two hundred miles. I went to the state capital. The only thing we can hope for is to get outta here with the clothes on our back and some pictures of what Nowhere used to be. And the last thing we need is a couple of well to do yuppies and their fancy luxury car telling us what to do. But why cancel the pageant? Cause it's a dream. And we can't afford dreams anymore. Then I feel sorry for you. I feel sorry for you, too. It was really nice to meet you ladies. What are you doin' here? Coffee? I don't want none. Coffee's getting cold. Brought you a cookie. I told ya, I don't want none! And will you stop coming in here unannounced! Hey, you good? All right, I'm ready. Okay. Here we go. Jingle bells, Coleman will this be your lucky day? Not much fun this is to ride... How much do you weigh? Oh, very funny, very funny. What now? When Jeremiah gets a burr in his saddle, he's pretty darn committed. Why this? He tried everything he could to keep the mining companies here. He offered every imaginable deal to get them to stay. He's been Mayor nearly twenty years. Folks were counting on him. If anybody could save this town, it'd be Jeremiah. But he didn't. He convinced people to stand behind him and when he lost the battle, so did they. You've seen those storefronts outside, the closed up ones. A lot of people lost everything because of Jeremiah. At least that's what they said. Aww, he took that so hard. But he's the Mayor so he accepted the blame. He even got resort experts in and they said if we built ski lifts on that great big hill that hotel chains would come flocking to us with their money. And no one would give us that first loan. I mean, one bank was interested, but they want collateral we just don't have. Maybe he's right. Maybe there is no hope for Nowhere. If there's one thing I know about banks, it's that you have to keep looking. There's always one that is willing to help, you just have to keep trying. Nobody wants to try anymore. You heard Jeremiah. Hey. You saw the look in those performers eyes. You saw them. If everybody saw that they'd change. You have to go ahead with it. Christmas eve is tomorrow. Hey for what it's worth, you were pretty good. I mean, kinda snappy and all, but you whipped us into almost passable shape. I guess it doesn't matter now that the Mayor stopped the show. I was wondering, do you wanna go get a coffee or something? They got mochas here? What's that? An overpriced coffee. I think the Bee Hive has those little packages of decaffeinated coffee. Sure, why not. Really? Nothing else to do here, is there? Jingle bells. Ohhh. One more, one more, one more, one more! Come on! In a one horse open... We did it! We did it! You did it, Mr. Benson. I think it's okay to call me Charles now. All right? How 'bout Chuck? Uh, Chucky baby. You are one hell of a guy. Man, I owe ya my life. Well, the snow stopped. That is... quite a mountain. How much does Jeremiah need? I think for starters, $400,000. Cheers. Cheers. Hello. Who's there? Ain't gonna get rid of you, am I? What do you want? I wanna see the Zephyr run. You know, my grand-daddy, gave her to me just before he... I was around your age. You know, she's never been run. Awesome. Might as well take her for a run. You'll probably never see somethin' like this again. Not with them computers and all that junk you kids have these days. Easy at first now. Easy, there she goes. Hi, Mom. Nolan's outside playing or something. I don't know what's going on. I think it's as old as the world is. No, I mean everything. It's like miss, I need an outlet mall, she's acting like she's lived here all her life. And then, there's Charles. Charles is working at a soup kitchen, and Charles doesn't cook. Nolan's outside playing in the snow. At home he'd either be watching twenty of the hundred television stations, or playing his computer and video games. And then there's me. Remember my big deal? I'd forgotten all about it. And they're all shut for sure by now. It's called a holiday. The word means a chance to spend time with family and friends. Well we've never had a holiday like this. I mean, if my friends could see me now. They'd probably be envious. Yeah. You know. I just really like your coffee. But, why not? Cause I ain't getting dressed up in no stupid costume, that's why! But I saw your picture out front, you were the best Santa ever. And I ain't doin nothin for that Jeremiah B. and that's that! It's for the kids and the town. My mom and Sam are putting on a Christmas show. Do you see what this place is, kid? You see what this place is now? It's nothing. This used to be the best toy store in the mountains. People drove here from fifty miles away to buy toys. Jeremiah B. wiped it out, he wiped out all the businesses. You look around this room, you see what Jeremiah B. did to me. I swore, I would never do anything to help him ever again. Or even the town after that. Never is never! Now don't you gotta be somewhere else. Sam! My first instinct is to pour this in your lap, but I am just way too nice of a person. Annie. What happened? Well Charles here, saved my life. Everything's fine. It's okay. Are you hurt or anything? I'm fine, I'm fine. Everything's okay. It's a long story. I'm just really happy to see you and be here. Oh... Will you guys cut it out? I found Santa! Dad? And I have got some great news. I just saw my cousin outside and the parts are in. So I'm gonna have your car ready to go by the morning. We can still have the Christmas like we planned. Well, it's as good as new. If there's one thing I do know, it's cars. It's cars! Thanks, Coleman. It's the least I could do, Ma'am. Meatloaf sandwiches for the road. What about the pageant? We're gonna do it anyway. Are you sure? I can't help it if the performers want to get together on Christmas eve and start accidentally doing what they've been practicing. Sure wish you were staying. I wish we could too. But we have the reservations and... Oh sure, I understand. It was grand meeting you, Annie. You too, Sam. You okay? Yeah, sure. Thanks. For everything. Just keep an eye on the oil gauge for the next hundred miles, all right? Should be okay. Okay. Thanks. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas to all of you. Nolan, come on, we gotta go. One word and you're dead. The radio's working! What? I don't believe it, three bars. What did you do that for? Look, your mother's gotta call her office, I gotta check the reservations at the resort. Why don't you guys go and get some sandwiches? Yeah, and I want a coffee... No, a latte. What's wrong? Something's missing. What exactly happened back there in Nowhere? I don't know yet. I have this feeling I should do something for them. You're certainly in a position to. Sure got a lot of garbage to eat. I want Sam's meatloaf sandwiches. We can have them tomorrow. I want them now. You know what? In a few hours we're gonna be at the resort, just in time for Christmas eve. I don't know anybody there. What? What about the parties? They're just school friends. I can see them anytime. What about me? I don't know anybody. You'll meet kids. Guys, we got all kinds of great presents, ready to open, on Christmas morning. Huh? I wonder what Santa's doing right now. We're dyin out there. I am not gonna let Jeremiah be right, not this time. You really think this is a good idea? Well, it's too late for that now. I'm gonna go look for Santa. Okay. Let's go. Woo, woo, woo, woo, woo! Yeah! Okay, come. Good job. You're next. Hey. What are you doing here? Uh, just a little unfinished business. How's it going? Don't ask. I can help you get the girls ready. Thank you. Oh. Oh, here buddy! Here! Now he catches it. Teddy! When are you on? We're on next. Oh! What are you doing here? We need a Santa Claus for the pageant! Go home, kid. I promised them I'd find Santa. Deck the halls with boughs of holly Fa la la la la la la la la Tis the season to be jolly fa la la la la la la la la Don we now our gay apparel fa la la la la la la la la Troll the ancient yuletide carol Fa la la la la la la la la Follow me in merry measure Fa la la la la la la la la la While I tell of yuletide treasure Fa la la la la la la la la Deck the halls with boughs of holly Deck the halls with boughs of holly Deck the halls with boughs of holly Deck the halls with boughs of holly, deck the halls! Yeah, Trish. Woo! She was awesome! She's really really good. She gets it all from her mother. Attitude too. You get ready. Everyone, it's not over 'til it's over. You did before, just like in your picture. Ya, well what did they do for me when I needed them, huh? The Mayor, the local bigwigs, they sold me out. All of them! But what would a kid know about that? What would a kid know about losing everything that mattered to ya because of the greed of others? You wanna know about other people, you take a look out there. You take a look at them empty stores, them deserted streets, that's what other people do for other people! They take away everything. But what about all those new toys? Well, that's for the day we reopen. If that ever happens. I think you need a time out. What's that? You know, when a kid does something bad and his parents tell him he needs a time out? Grownups think it helps. You need a time out. So what you do is sit there quietly and think about stuff. What kind of stuff? Your parents usually tell you to think about what you did bad. And what's that supposed to do? I dunno, usually by the time I sit down I forgot what I was supposed to think about. So you figure, that I should forget about what they did to me? Yeah, so you could be Santa. I'm just not gonna get rid of you, am I? Good job, good job! There he is! What now? No. Yes, I think now is the perfect time. I, I just don't think, he's not gonna like it. Oh, I'm so proud of you. Okay, girls, come here. Just remember, lead with your right. Where's Sydney? She's not coming. Her knee swelled up to the size of a beach ball. It looks like your size. No. You know you wanna. No way! I'll pay you all my allowance for the next month. The next two months, promise. Oh my. Is that your Mom? I don't believe it. Go get 'em, girls. I didn't know Mom could still dance. Well, she can. We're a hit! That was so cool! Jeremiah! Jeremiah! I think I can help you. Not now, Charles, I can handle this. I can't believe it! We wish you a merry Christmas we wish you a merry Christmas we wish you a merry Christmas and a happy new year Good tidings we bring, to you and your kin good tidings for Christmas and a happy new year Oh bring us some figgy pudding, oh bring us some figgy pudding, oh bring us some figgy pudding now bring it right here. We won't go until we get some, we won't go until we get some, we won't go until we get some, so bring it right here. Ho, ho, ho! Merry Christmas, everyone! Ho, ho, ho! Ho, ho, ho, ho! Merry Christmas, everyone! Nolan! Merry Christmas! I have a very special gift for you. I'll take good care of it. I gotta say. We're gonna miss you guys. Your family sure has touched this town. Well you're gonna, you're gonna be seeing more of us. Really? I've been able to arrange the ski lift loan. Oh. Okay did you hear what I said? I said, I've been able to arrange to get you the $400,000. Yeah, it's just uh, hold on, everybody. Why would you wanna go on and do somethin' like that? For these people. Because, because they deserve it. And just like that, you're gonna go on and give Nowhere almost a half a million dollars? When I first came to this town I thought, I thought it was finished. But then I got to know the people and I realized that there is so much more here. I mean, I saved a man's life. Look, and I saw that there was hope. And it, it came in the form of, I dunno, a bunch of singers and dancers, and chickens. You're a banker, aren't ya? Yes. Well, you're gonna need approval. Yeah, I will have to ask the bank president, but um, I think I'll say yes. You're? Well? Sure! Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas. Thanks! I lovI love you. We wish you a merry Christmas We wish you a merry Christmas We wish you a merry Christmas and a happy new year.
