They're going to take our shoes. So, come on then. Take offyour shoes. I mean it.|Take offyour shoes. Take offyour shoes! - Dr. Brault.|- Can I helpyou? You were in charge ofthe probation|exchange scheme during the early '80s? Ifyou would contact my offiice-- I'm investigating a former resident.|Could you spare me a few moments? Who areyou investigating? Eris,Joanna. - Cognac?|- Please. She did fiine with the foster homes. The theft was nothing more than|a youthful dare-- thereyou go-- that certainly didn't amount|to 1 2 months' detention. That's where the real damage|was done. She tried to kill herself|several times. Stuck her hand right through|a plate glass window... and attempted to hack it off. Did you know that? Cigarette? And after her release|she came straight toyou. They all came to me. I was federal probation chief|at the time. The whole exchange program|was my idea. Remove the girls from|their familiar environments... unearth them, probate them|where they had no roots. Well, it didn't work.|Itjust didn't work. After a couple ofyears|it became a very costly blur. The girls were all unmanageable... ignorant, demented female hoods. All, that is, but... Joanna, number 8773. Joanna Eris. She was unique. I had her|immediately transferred to Boston. - Foryour own personal supervision.|- Mm-hmm. Forgive me for asking,|Dr. Brault. Areyou wearing a wig? Does she still wearwigs? One ofthe little tricks|I taught her. Never reveal yourselfto any man|who doesn't need to know. Nowyou need to know. And what other little tricks|did you teach her? I taught her to survive, to fiight|and never let the motherfuckers in. Survival ofthe fiittest,Joanna. Kill or be killed. Was she ever|sexually molested by a man? - Not to my knowledge.|- Wereyou? All right. That's enough.|Get out. - Detective, my ass. Who areyou?|- Miss Eris is in a lot oftrouble. - I'm someone that's trying to help.|- What? To fiind out where|the trouble started? Nowyou thinkyou've got|a pretty good idea, is that it? Who the hell doyou people|thinkyou are? This girl came to me a weak,|pathetic little fiield mouse. You hand me the problems,|never the solutions. Get out. -Jan?|- Yes. Come on in, girls. God bless you foryour time, Doctor.|Keep up the good work. - Get out. What is it?|- Areyou all right? Ofcourse.|Ofcourse I'm all right. Pisces.|Familiaritybreeds contempt. Time to endtheholiday|andgetback to work... remembering to tie upall|loose endsbeforeyoumove on. Yoursearch is farfrom over... asyour true companionstill|waitspatientlyin the wings. Oh, no, no, no. Why don'tyoujust take out|a fucking advertisement? I've always wondered what it took to|contain a large family, and now I know. Stamina. - I'm exhausted.|- That'sjust one side ofthe family. - Look!|- Ineverlook. Whatisit? It's a skunk. That's about the best|sign ofgood luckyou'll ever have. Only when thestarsare right|andthemoonis full. How's the moon? It's full as a bull, old-timer. So how will we celebrate|our good fortune? A simple ceremony... here or St. Boniface. Nothing too elaborate.|Quaint and charming... for, say... 800 ofyour closest friends. Now, call me old-fashioned, but... isn't it I who should|pop that question? Well, technically, yes. But whywould you think|a lovelyyoung thing such as myself... would want to tie the knot|with a blind old coot... who's rapidly approaching|his "use by" date. Not to mention the fact that|you're a Virgo, Mr. Leonard... and I knowyou better|than you knowyourself. And ofcourse, there's always|your fortune that I'm after. Why, Charlotte?|Why me? Becauseyou can't see|who I really am... and I think it's in the stars. Verywell, Miss Vincent. I do. Until tomorrow, then, my darling. I loveyou, Mr. Leonard. You know, I never did|buyyou that pendant. Ofcourseyou didn't. Take care ofher, Roy. I knowyou're there. What doyou want? Open your eyes,|you stupid blind bastard! She's gonna kill ya!|She's gonna kill ya! Come on!|I'm taking you away! What areyou doing here?|It's early. Come on!|We're gonna get married! - What?|- We're gonna get married! Now? Mr. Leonard, I think I have|something to tell you. Congratulations. You'rekiddingme. That's fantastic.|I'mgonnabea father? Congratulations, Daddy. Stop.|Please stop. Stop. Stop. Please fucking stop.

I'm sure every man and his dog|has tried a line on you. Has anyone ever told you|you have very sad eyes? Yes, they have, Gary. Has anyone ever told you|you need a shower? That's a pretty mean-looking shark|you got there, princess. It's a fiish. Pisces. Looks like a shark to me. You like sharks? I like the myths. They have a limited memory. Maybe only a minute or two. Sounds like a pretty good life to me. Ofcourse, the down side is... they can never stop swimming. Even when they're asleep... they have to keep moving forward. 'Cause ifthey stop|for even a moment... they'll die. - Fuck me dead.|- What? Nothing. I wasjust-- I wasjust saying you could lay|your dentures on my bedside table... any day ofthe week, princess. - What areyou talking about?|- Nothing. Forget it. Stupid bitch.

And there's this guy.|And I bend over... to pick up his girlfriend|who's sprawled on the floor... completely fucking smashed... and the fucker hits me in the ass|with this yellow featherweight dart... right between the cheeks. Can you believe it? So what do I do?|I nail him to the bar... and use his head|for a fucking dart competition. What's all this stuff? That'sjust a little something|to get the evening started, darling. Thanks. I'll pass. No. No, don't.|It'sjust for fun. I don't want to have to blast alone. It's not my thing.|You go right ahead.

Side dishes? - Taurus?|- Yeah. - Doyou believe in the stars?|- Not anymore. Pisces reads... "It may seem you have reached|the end ofyour road... but all is about to change. The sacrifiiceyou are about to make|will become another's salvation." And then it says,|"You will never be forgotten." - Doyou want some coffee?|- Yes, please. I'm bustin' at the seams, Frank. You don't mind sharing, doyou? All done, gentlemen? - Who gets the check?|- I got it. Coffee? - What doyou think?|- Can't say for sure. - Worth a try, though.|- Yeah. Fucking cops. What about them?

I'm in real estate in the valley. That's why I can helpyou|get a house. Getting a house isn't a problem. It's easy enough. What doyou do in a house... when you wake up in it? What doyou do on Christmas... in a house? I'm supposed to be so... young, and not have anything|to show for myself... except a big sense ofloss. That hardly fiills up a house. What haveyou lost? I've lost my childhood... myyouth... my father... my husband... my daughter. She wasn't any bigger than a minute. Barely had a name. Now my mind's going too.|It plays tricks on me. And spookiest ofall,|I lost my angel. I had a guardian|who looked after me. I think I miss him most. My angel. Maybe he'll come back someday. Come back and bury me|in my favorite graveyard in Valdez. It's not up to us, though. Is it?|It's up to the gods. The whole thing is. What haveyou lost? It's only fair. This one's my daughter... I think. She was an embassy kid|and was relocated-- or dislocated is, I think,|the word that they used-- every ten months. I simply came home one day|and she wasn't there anymore. And seven years later,|I stopped looking for her. The thing that gets me the most|is that she had no choice. She simplywoke up one morning... and didn't have a father anymore. So I'm just a daddy|who lost his little girl. And I guess you're a little girl... who lost her daddy. And that's it. End ofstory. Romeo, we're real crowded today.|You're gonna have to share.
