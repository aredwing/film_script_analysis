Sounds like she has a sore throat. - What's wrong, Kiran? - She needn't say. I know it all. All these girls do nowadays is to roam till late at nights with friends. She has shouted her voice hoarse. And they'll eat whatever they like. Is that a sign of love for music? - That's going to get you nowhere. - Please do not say so, maestro. Tell us Kiran, d'you or don't you want to master classical music? You must devote yourself completely to your lessons. I'll be back after a few days. Get over the sore throat by then. Greetings, Sir. - Does he have a problem with me? - Never mind the daily dramatics. Have you got the tickets to the New Year's party? A pack of biscuits and a bread. Need anything more? - No thanks. How much was that? - Fifteen bucks. Rohit Kumar, your neighbor upstairs, screams his head off all day. Aren't your ears sore already? - That's him rehearsing music. And he loves music. Besides, I am not irked to complain. For God's sake! How come you're so busy with your accounts so early in the morning? Won't you sit down to a cuppa? - Woe beside! Rohit Kumar hasn't paid me in 3 months now. He gets me to make him new dresses every now and then. But just doesn't bother to pay for the stitching. He owes me a large sum too. But I just can't complain. Hey Kanhaiya! Come over for a cup of tea. Give it a rev. It's all your fault. You've given the house to a tuppence worth of a singer on rent. All you have for yourself is a room in the backyard. Has he paid the rents yet? He'll pay up in due course. Fine fellow. How are you, Rohit? Hello, good morning. - Good morning. Come over here, Qasim. - In a moment. I'm ravenous. - What can I get you? a special cup of tea. - Coming up. Mister Rohit kumar. Hello, Mr. Jamshed. How d'you do? Forget niceties. Talk cash. Some bills are due for a couple of months. Today's the first of the month. I'll settle your account on 30th. Very well... er... what did you say? By the 30th? Exactly. How many days between the 30th and the first? - One day. - He's making a fool out of Jamshed. - That's right. Didn't you have a show last night? How did it go? It was a riot! - Was it then?! - The crowd went berserk as I sang. And the girls were crazy about me. There was this girl who caught my eye. She has beautiful eyes and a pretty face. Fabulous! What happened later? - She left after the program ended. If she comes into my life, I'll write the best songs on earth. Dream you may. But everyone cannot become Elvis. Shut up Moolchand. You're a grocer. What d'you know about music? Someday Rohit Kumar will make the greatest singer in our country. Cheers. - Cheers... cheers. No one even bothers to listen. Look... it's Mehra. He's counting the proceeds of the show last night. He made 50 to 60,000 last night. - And we don't get a penny of it. Happy New Year, Mr. Mehra. What's so special about a New Year? Just another day and another night. Oh yes. But it was a grand show last night, wasn't it? Well, average, I'd say. - Average, d'you say? - About that. There! Look at the pile you made last night. - What are you up to? It's all because of me, Sir. People come here to hear me sing. That's how you sake in the moolah. - D'you take yourself for a star... ...just because I've put up a couple of your portraits? - You see, Sir. I am... - You should be grateful to me! Grateful for letting you sing before such a large gathering! Minstrels like you roam the streets a dime-a-dozen. And no one would even care to give you tuppence. You ingrate! Hii. - What? How dare you misbehave! You come here to sing. Not to chase girls! I'm not chasing her, Sir. I was just... I'm responsible for the harangue. - It's a part of my daily diet. Now, what's it you were saying? I'd like to learn how to sing from you. - From me? And, you wrote such a beautiful song. I'm crazy about your song. I can't think of anything else. I couldn't sleep last night after your show. I kept humming the tune. - Neither did I sleep after the show last night. - Why? It is a new tune that kept me up all the night. Would you like to hear it? Of course. Hold this. Fantastic. Wonderful. Such a beautiful song! So romantic. Songs like that are what I'd like to sing. Not the classicals. Please teach me how to sing a song like that. I'll work hard at it. No problem. - Great. Why don't we get married, Kiran? What?! I'm serious. I've never thought about it. I've only think about one thing. - What? Music and my career. I want to make the greatest singer of the land. That'll be difficult. - Why? Because that status has been booked for me a long while ago. Kiran. What could be better for both of us? We travel towards same goals. And we could reach our goal together. Tell me... will you marry me? What brings you here? He's a famous singer. - I see. So you are a singer, are you? Actually, I'm a composer. I write the songs I sing. Classicals? Not classicals. I sing lighter tunes. - How light? I don't think you understand. - Please help me too. I sing songs that strike a chord in the heart. And where do you sing such songs? Presently, I sing at a hotel. - At a hotel? One might as well sing at a hotel as go around with a begging bowl. As with wandering minstrels who collect pence in tips if at all. Enough. I have not come here to discuss my careers. So, what brings you here? Excuse me, Kiran. Stop, Rohit! Listen to me... Rohit... Please Rohit. I didn't invite Rohit so you might insult him. D'you take me for a fool? A look at him and I know why you invited him. Stop being foolish. Your marriage has already been fixed. I'm in love with Rohit. - Do you hear what she says? You must consider the consequences. This is not done. The upbringing and education I've given her all these years are a waste! If you think so highly about my upbringing and my education... ...you should respect my decisions too. I have a feeling that he's a cunning fellow. He's ensnaring you. You're still an innocent girl. - I'm no innocent, mother. And what does that make of you? I'm an artist. And, he's an artist too. You can't gauge our sentiments. Don't I understand? An artist my foot! A Bremen-town musician! A good for nothing vagabond! And she wants to marry him! You'll get to know about the realities in life in no time! Don't you come back crying later on. Our doors will have closed for you. Just as well that you told me all this. It'll help me take my decision. I'm going to marry Rohit. Kiran... Kir... Enough. - I'll floor them at the audition today. - May I accompany you? It'll take me 2 minutes to get dressed. Isn't the plumber expected in today? See you. Bye. How are you going to climb four stories in the condition you are? But, this is your first recording. And I wanted to be there with you. I'm not recording for a film. Its just a jingle for an advertisement. When am I going to meet the right people? When will I start working? It's just a matter of a few more months. What makes you so upright? Hello, Farida. Come in. - What are you doing? Nothing much. Just cooking. Like a cup of tea? - Why not? - Is the tea brewed? - Yes. I haven't seen you around in 4 or 5 days. Have you been keeping well? - Absolutely. What's the matter? You seem tense. - Not at all. I'm perfectly fine. How are your music rehearsals going on? I hardly find time outside household chores. How am I to rehearse? What of the career in music? Can you immerse yourself so in the chores? You must carve out some time everyday for rehearsing. Look at me... I must fetch Sonu from school after I finish cooking. I'll go and fetch Sonu... Yes. I will. It doesn't really matter. Thanks. Hi, Kiran. Will you please draw a bath for me? Make it fast. I've to attend a party. - What party? - Oh, there's something I'd like you to know. - I've dumped the job. - Why? I had enough of Mehra's abuses. Besides, I want to move upwards. What's more, I met Gulbadan Kumar today. - Gulbadan Kumar? Yes. He owns Prince Records. Its really tough to get to meet him. I walked into his office and sang a few songs. He liked my voice. He invited me to the party this evening. Looks like I've made it. Just press these clothes for me, will you? - I'm coming with you! What'll you do there? You'd get bored. - No. I won't get bored. What about Sonu? - Farida can put him to sleep. All right. You can come along. Get dressed in some good clothes. Now. Take the clothes. Press them quickly. Congratulations, Mr. Gulbadan Kumar. Ever since your company was formed music sales have grown manifold. It's the grace of The Divine Mother. A double gold disc for the music directors. Someday I'll get mine too. I've recorded my voice on a cassette... Rohit! I've recorded one of my songs in a cassette. - Will you please give it to Gulbadan Kumar? - All right. Hows the good lady? I greet you in the name of The Divine Mother. Hello. - I'm Rohit Kumar. - Of course, Mr. Rohit Kumar. - Greetings! - Grand party. - It's modest really. - Have you listened to my cassette? - Yes I did. - Did you like it? - Very nice. - Thank you, Sir. Thank you, Sir. Glory be to The Divine Mother! Congratulations, Mr. Gulbadan! You're raking in gold discs. Let's pose for a photograph. You're the biggest of them all. - Not at all. - Isn't it, now? It's the two of you, Messrs Amar & Kaushik who are the most well known. That's the magic of our music. We've defined 6 super hit films. Our critics are now silenced. - Indeed. Indeed, Mr. Gulbadan. You must listen to the music we've scored for our next film. We recorded a song yesterday. Beautiful! Which film is the song meant for? Well... he's an upcoming artiste. He's also a singer. - Mr. Rahul Kumar. - I'm Rohit Kumar, Sir. Oh yes... Mr. Rohit Kumar. - Do you sing? - Yes, Sir. I see. For whom have you sung till now? Nothing special yet. - Yes. Go on. - I want to sing for you. Of course. - Thank you. - Don't forget to give my cassette. - Oh yes. But, stop it now, will you? Yes... what is it? - I'm not only a singer. I've written a few songs too. And what are you? - A composer. In a country like ours, just about anyone can turn a composer. Call me up on Monday. If your voice is worth it, you're made. I'll come over on Monday after giving you a call. What more could you want? Glory be to The Divine Mother. - Mr. Gulbadan Yes, Sir. Why aren't you giving him my cassette? I can't give the cassette now. - Why? It was so difficult getting an audition for myself. - So what? How can I ask them to audition my wife too? They'll think I'm trying to force my family down their throats. Please cheers for amar kaushik. So, d'you feel that I'm imposing myself upon you? I never said that. That's what you meant! - I'm tired and I don't want to get into a fight. D'you mean to say that I want to get into a fight? Sonu is sleeping. I'd only asked you to hand over my cassette. Was it so difficult? I haven't heard what you've recorded. I don't even know what's in it. I don't know if it's worth a hearing. And, it was tough getting an audition. Must I lose a chance by trying to push your cassette? An hour ago, you loved my voice. Now, it isn't worth auditioning! I don't mean that. One must practice regularly to be able to sing properly. - Practice. Just another excuse! And I think I understand you perfectly, Rohit. You've been pursuing your career. And all I get are flimsy excuses. Please don't scream. Why don't you say it plainly? That I don't have the aesthetics. That I should stop dreaming about becoming a professional singer. That's not what's going to be, Rohit. I won't give up! And you for one, cannot break my resolve! Get that? I don't know why Rohit is doing this. He mustn't do this to you. It's wrong on his part. - We've finished our homework, Mother. May we go to play? - Make sure you return soon. - All right. You have the right to a career. Why don't you discuss it with Rohit? What are you doing here? I've been looking for you so long. I had to discuss some things with Farida. - What? Besides Sonu is getting on my nerves. Who is to take care of him? I have to go to a rehearsal. Where are my clothes? How about some food? I'm coming over. - And, where's the file of my songs? I've been looking for it all day. I just can't find it. I'd brought it down with me for my practice session. Why don't you just sit over here for the rest of the day practicing! I said I'm coming. - Don't bother. You can practice singing for the rest of the day. I'll feed myself at a restaurant. I'll look after the household too. - Have I ever refused to do all that? What've you done? - Sorry, Mother. - You've got my washing all dirty. I've been at the laundry for 2 hours. And I've asked you not to play here. How many times have I asked you not to play?! What's up, Kiran? Why did you beat him? What has he done? He won't listen to me. And now, he's got the laundry all dirty. I'm sick and tired of chorus all day. I've gone out of my mind. Kiran... Kiran. We tread upon the same path, Kiran. What could be better for both of us? I am sorry sonu... sorry. Ilove you. Kiran... Kiran. Open up, quickly. Come on, hurry up. Make sure to remember the day today. We'll celebrate this day every year. This is the day I've awaited forever. The day on which my career commences! Today was the day! Amar-Kaushik were left speechless after I auditioned. I'm singing the first song for Pawan Chopra's new film. I'm leaving, Rohit. And they said that if this song passes the muster while recording... ...I'll get to sing all the songs for the film. I'm recording tomorrow. Want to come along? - I said I'm leaving. - Where are you going? - Here are the keys to the house. These are the rationing cards... and here are the bills for the month. I've paid all the bills. You'll find the balance of the money in the cupboard. Here's the electricity bill. Make sure you pay it up by the weekend. I'm leaving you. Wait a minute! What are you saying? What's happened? Have I done anything wrong? - No, you haven't. - What's it then? Tell me. - Don't touch me! Just let me go. - But why are you leaving? Say something! Why don't you understand! It isn't just an isolated something. It might be my mistake too. Something is happening to me. - What's this with you? I don't know! - It's nothing more than a figment of your imagination. Please, let me go. I must make a life for myself. But this and here, is what your life is! Else, I'll go out of my mind. So you want to walk out of this marriage. But what of Sonu? How can you walk out on him? But, he's better off without me. Oh God! I don't believe this! Kiran! Why are you doing this to me?! I've just got my golden chance. And here you are... walking out on me! I need you, Kiran. If you stand by me, I can even reach for the stars. But you had told me that we'd reach out for the stars together. D'you feel that I'm trying to stop you from becoming a singer? You might dream of becoming a singer. But don't expect me to go around singing false praises for you. Look, I am sorry. I lost my head. I agree that both of us have made mistakes. But that doesn't mean that you must walk out of your home. Isn't that so? We can always mend our ways. Now, come in. Now you're being stubborn. Just like your parents. Don't drag my parents into this. - Why not? You carry the same traits. Now, are you going to stop taunting my parents?! Won't I! They haven't been able to achieve anything in life. And they're jealous of others. And d'you think I'm jealous of your success? - Yes! Thank you very much. I won't ever forget that. I'd rather suffer my traits than your taunts for the rest of my life. Rohit... Where has Kiran gone? What I should be asking you? - Why me? She used to spend more than half her working hours in your company. And the two of you must've more than discussed my weak points. Forget all that. Kiran has left you. - We must do something about it. - Not "we". It's I who has to do. And I'll do whatever must be done. Rohit. You must try to understand it now or never. Kiran is very unhappy. - And the fact is that... - Fact remains that of the past 6 years... ...I've been trying heart and soul to get a break... ...so that my career can take off; so that my life shapes up! After 6 long years, I get a break. I'm slated to sing for Amar-Kaushik! I took a cab home as soon as I got to know; so that I could... ...share the greatest moment of my life with her. And she tells me that she's walking out of my life. What does it mean?! - She couldn't share the greatest moment of your life. It's your life, after all. - You're fantastic! Your fabulous. That your husband deserted you because you were unhappy... ...doesn't mean that every woman is unhappy with her husband. I haven't come here to discuss my husband. I'm concerned about Kiran. You may keep your concern within your confines. - I shall. Before I leave, let me tell you that you could never understand Kiran. She is no petty woman to serve as a part of your interior decor. She had her own dreams. And it takes courage for a woman to walk out. Yes! And it takes more to walk out on a helpless child. Isn't that so? Daddy... daddy... daddy... daddy. Why are you sleeping here? - Oh... what? - And where's Mummy? Ohh! God! - Tell me... Where's Mummy? - What's the time now? The small hand is on 7. And the big hand is on 3. I'm going to be late for the recording. Tell me, Daddy... where's Mummy? - Wait a minute. - You mother has gone to your aunt's. - Which aunt? The one in Pune. - Aunt Ratna lives there. - That's where she has gone. - When is she going to come back? - Very soon... in 3 or 4 days. Now make a move. I've got to get ready. - Who's going to get me ready for school? - I will, son. - And, who'll pack my school bag? - I will. - Who'll take me to school? - I will. - What about my breakfast? - I... what do you eat for breakfast? An omelette of 2 eggs, toast with butter and Bournvita. A dash of coriander... and onions. Ever had one of my omelets? - No. - Try it today. You'll love it. - You're cutting them in such large chunks! - That's just fine. Isn't this fun! Yes, it's fun. Now, take a look at this... a circus with one hand... two eggs in one hand! Now take a look at how I break both eggs using one hand. The eggs had soft-shells. But never mind. This place is perfectly clean. What are you doing? I'm not going to eat that! - It has shells in it. - A few shells will make the omelette crisp. - Here go the onions... and the chilies. - Not that way! - How else? Mummy used to flip the ingredients first. What Mummy doesn't know... ...is that an omelette is an omelette, flip or flap! Eat it and you'll know. Later on, I'll drop you at the school. And afterwards, I'm off to record my first song ever! Your Daddy is going to become a famous singer. - What's up? - The toast is burning! - Oh no! Well, never mind that. You don't know a thing! Go on in... hurry. Go inside. - Who'll come to pick me up? - I'll come. Where are you going to wait for me? I'll wait for you under this tree, okay? Now go on inside. - What if you don't turn up? - I said I'll come. And, I will. - What if you're late? - I won't be late. I'll be here on time. What if you're still late? If I am, you can wait under the tree. Go on, now. Hurry. - When does the school get over? - No idea. When does the junior school get over? - I'm that child's father. - At 2 o'clock. - I'm sorry to be late. - Is this your idea of time? You've turned a star even before you've recorded a single song. I got stuck in the traffic. Never mind. Sit inside and get the lines. We'll record the orchestra in the meantime - Give him his lines, will you? - Let's have another take. Come on for the break in your life. - We can fit the 16 tracks on to 12. - Very well. Let's try. Let's have the rhythm. Still waiting here? I'm afraid we won't be recording you today. - Sir? - Increase the bass slightly. - When will I record? - After a couple of days perhaps. Do keep calling to find out. I'm late by only half-an-hour. Must you be so upset? - You said you'd be here on time. - I did. But I was so busy. - What if someone kidnapped me? - But no one did? What if someone did? I've told ten times that I'm sorry. You must forgive someone who apologizes. Do you know the meaning of the word "sorry"? What are you doing? What's up? This car run on batteries. It has a horn. And, the headlights work too. - So what? - I'll forgive you if you buy me one. What if I don't? Won't you forgive me ever? Had it been Mummy, she would've got the car for me. Ask your mother for one when she comes back. Now, let's go. Come on. - 250 grams of lentil... anything else? - A packet of tea. - The Red Label, or the Yellow? - Yellow. - Not Yellow. The Red one. - Why? - Because Mummy used to buy the Red Label. Give me red. A pack of soap and coconut oil. - Can I have a chocolate? - Take these upstairs. Forgive me for asking this... but I heard something. Is it true? I heard that your wife left your... ...no, I mean to say that she didn't care for you. She didn't care for the child. Nor her status! Let me have this package. - Here. And I didn't like her either. She used to have this temper. Have I asked you what you liked or disliked about my wife? - No, I mean... - Have I asked for your opinion? I come here to buy groceries. Not to listen to your useless banter. - Do you understand? - Understood. Here's your stuff. That's worth 300. The balance last month was 350, totaling 650 bucks. - And I've stopped giving credit. - I'm not asking for it. Here's your money. 550... and I'm sending 100 bucks for you right away. That's the credit. - Is that all right, Mr. Manohar? - Yes. Let's record it. Thank you, Mr. Sharma for letting my friend sing in the chorus. - She'll even sing a lead part if you let her do it. - Of course. Shall we proceed, Mr. Manohar? Take a look at this! A letter from Mummy. A letter from Mummy! Here! - I see... it's addressed to you. - Oh yes! It is. Read it, quickly. And tell me when Mummy is coming home. - Read it aloud. - Oh, yes. "My dear Sunil..." "You must be wondering where your Mummy has gone all of a sudden." "Let me explain this... sometimes your Daddy had to leave home." "And then, it was Mummy who looked after you." "Sometimes, when mothers leave, fathers have to look after children." "Your Mummy wants to make a career for herself, Sunil." "That's why I had to leave your home." "I may not live with you anymore. But, you'll remain in my heart." "Don't ever think that Mummy will forget you." "I remain your Mummy always. And I'll love you always." "Take care of yourself. And, on your way back from school everyday..." That was marvelous. Ms. Vandana. And you must concentrate, Rohit.@ I want the right perspective in your voice. - Yes, sir. Don't sing in a stifled voice. Open your voice up. That's my file, Sir. It contains the songs I have written. Don't be afraid. We won't steal your tunes. No! I didn't mean that. Let's proceed with another take. Let's have a rehearsal without the music accompaniment. That's a lot of crap! Let's have some real voice. Haven't you eaten? - Go on... sing it. - Yes, Sir. Forget about turning a music director and concentrate on singing. - I'll ruin his happiness. - Why! We have a composer! - Go on. - Yes, Sir. Nonsense! Forget it. Please sing his lines for him, Ms. Vandana. - Well done, Ms. Vandana. Excellent. - Did you get an idea of the tune? - That's what I've been singing. - Sing it properly! - Yes, Sir. What are you doing! You're out of tune! What are you up to?! - Please let me finish my lines. - Shut up! - If you interrupt, you can't appreciate the singing. - Shut up! - Please listen to me. Bloody fool! Who d'you think you are? Stay within your limits! Else I'll throw you out of here. And, I'll banish you forever from filmdom. Will a singer in a night club to teach me how to compose music?! - Yes. I can. - What! What was it you said?! Oh yes! I'll teach you how to score music right away. That is, if you may dare to listen to me. Isn't this how you've composed it? Isn't that your song? Now listen to this. Please play along with me. What are you up to, Sunil? Be quiet and eat your food. Pick up your spoon. Go on. Eat. It's yucky. It's bell plant and it's very good for you. Go on, eat it. - I don't like bell plants. - You do. Aunt Farida has cooked it for you. And you've eaten it earlier. - What's all this black stuff in this? - Onions. Now eat it. - Onions give me stomachaches. - Not at all. And now start with the bread. - It's Yucky. - You mustn't call food "yucky". Don't spit on your plate. Where are your manners? Go on. Eat it now. There... I've removed the onions. There's this chocolate ice-cream you've brought. It's in the fridge. Yes I know about the ice cream. But, you won't get any of it. You must finish your food first. Only afterwards you may eat it. Sunil! Where are you going? Don't you open the fridge! Now don't take the ice-cream out of the fridge. Can't you hear me? I'm getting very angry with this now. Don't take the ice cream. I'm warning you, Sunil. I'm warning you. Don't you dare eat that ice cream. Eat the ice-cream and you'll face dire consequences. D'you understand? Now! And let go of the chair. You unmannered boy! And stop screaming. - I want to got to Mummy! - Enough of it. No food for you. Nor any ice cream. You can go to sleep hungry. I hate you. I won't talk to you ever again. Will you leave me and go away too? Never. But Mummy left me and went away. That's because I'm a bad boy. Is that what you think? That isn't true. Mummy loves you. She didn't leave because of you. She left because I couldn't understand her. I wanted her to do what all other mothers do all their lives... ...tending the family and doing household chores. But she wanted to do something else. And she tried to reason with me. But I was too involved with my life and myself. And do you know why she stayed back so long with us? That's because she loved you, son. She didn't leave us because of you. She left because of me. Now, go to sleep. Let's start a new life from tomorrow... you and me. - Let's have another ride. - No. I'm tired. Go on. Play by yourself. You've changed so completely, Rohit. I only wish Kiran should've seen you in these spirits. - Don't talk about Kiran. - Very well. - Tell me the truth... don't you ever think about her? - Not at all. Look at me, Daddy! - Don't do that, Sunil. - No! It's my turn now! Don't you think about your husband? His case was quite different. He had started having an affair. Really? I had no idea. Who was it? He had this girl in his office. And my Romeo wanted to bring her home. What nonsense! Look at me now, Daddy! I'm coming down standing up! - No, Sonu. What are you up to? Get down. - I'll get him down. What happened afterwards? I told him he was free to do what he liked. But I wouldn't let go of the house. It's for my children and me. - No! Sonu! - Watch your step, Sonu! What's happened, Sonu?! Take him to a hospital. Hurry! Nothing's going to happen to you, Sonu. I'll treat you to ice creams afterwards. I'm Ravinder Kapoor. I'm the chief assistant director in RP Films. - I see. - I have come here for a sound transfer. I saw your friend all of a sudden. She's very good. My director wants a smart girl as he is about to shoot an important scene. The role is that of a friend to the leading lady. No. Not stand-by. You don't know Mr. Kapoor. That's right. Mr. Paresh Kapoor. - You must've seen his film last year. - Yes. - It was a super hit. It's still raking in royalties. - How many days is she to work at it? - It's only a day's shoot. - But... - How much money will she make? gets 100 bucks as conveyance. - I'll speak to her about it. - Please do try. I'll wait for you. I've dumped Sunju. He says that I'm selfish. He asked me why I went to see a film when he was sick. I couldn't bore myself sitting by him all evening; now could I? Have I done anything wrong? Tell me, Anjali... have I done anything wrong? You were supposed to deliver your lines. Don't you remember your lines? Will she be able to deliver the lines? You wanted someone simple and innocent. She'll deliver all right. Didn't I tell you that I don't know anything about acting? Tell me, Anjali... What have I done wrong? You haven't done the right thing, Deepa. D'you remember how anxious he was when you had fallen sick? He kept by you and cared for you like a man possessed. And you can't even spare an evening for him! You call that boredom. The truth is that you've never even understood Sunju. He loves you very much. She's going on saying whatever she wants to. I'd told you earlier that I know nothing about acting. I tried it at my friend's instance. I really want to become a singer. Very well... you may sing some. Sir?! Please listen to the songs I've scored. I've helped you already. I introduced you to Amar Kaushik. And you've disgraced me. - They started misbehaving with me. - Will they really misbehave? - You see, Mr. Gulbadan. - You see, Mr. Rohit... I merely run a small-time music company. We only publish records and cassettes. I'm not a film producer. Now, please excuse me. - I'll be back in a minute. - Please take your time. One minute, Mr. Rohit. I can help you sell your songs. Amar Kaushik needs new tunes. I'll get you 2000 for each tune. - Here's my card. - So they get the credit for my compositions. Why bother about the credit? You want me to give you a job so you can walk out on me again. That won't happen ever again. I beg your pardon. Please give me a chance. - Isn't that, Mrs. Kiran? - Yes. She's Rohit Kumar's wife. - She's made a heroine in films. - She used to sing. And now, she's up to dancing in public. Come quickly, Dad. Take a look... over there. It's Mummy's picture. They put up the posters today. I want to see Mummy's film. You'll take me to see it, won't you? You'll take me, won't you, Daddy? Won't you, Daddy? Please tell me. How are we to see Mummy's film now? It's a "house-full" show. Let's go home. I want to see Mummy's film! You'd promised to show me Mummy's film. I want to see Mummy's film at once! Hurry up, Daddy. How come you're here? No one is allowed up here. He wants to see how his Mummy's film is projected. I spoke to the manager. - Is he Ms. Kiran's son? - Yes. - Very well. You can sit here and see it. "Tell me... what can you do for my sake" "I'd get the sun, the moon and the stars for you." "I'd get the sun, the moon and the stars for you." "I'd bring the heavens and earth together for your sake." What's the matter, honey? I'd rather love a straightforward fellow. "You needn't bring the sun, moon, nor the stars into this." "You can take your rotten son back to America with you." "Before you leave, try some delicious Indian cakes." Can you tell us how you are feeling right now, Mrs. Kiran? I'm happy to see that the audiences have liked my performance. Would you like to work again with Paresh Kapoor? Yes, of course. Any plans for the future? What kind of films would you like? I haven't thought about it. We hear that you are Mrs. Kiran Kumar. - It's said that you're married, and that you have a son. Who said that? Don't ask vulgar questions... Please step aside. Come along, Kiran. Let's go. - Has Mummy forgotten me, Daddy? - No. - Then why didn't she stop? Why didn't she talk to me? - Can I go to see her sometime? - No. - Why not? Did you see those stars? They shine, merrily, but they are far away from us. Your Mummy is now like a star. You can see her and long for her. But you can't go anywhere near her. Come on... Let's go home. Then, my Mummy goes to a forest. She comes across a huge fellow in the forest. My Mummy bashes him up. - Go upstairs, Sunil. - After a minute, please, Daddy. Then the hero comes, and sings a song with my Mummy. - My mummy's very beautiful. -Really? - She's more beautiful than yours. Beautiful she is. But, she's more stubborn than she's beautiful. Why don't you go over to her, patch up and bring her back? If I go to her now, she'll think that I've come because she's a star. Forget her. In any case, it was she who left me. I didn't desert her. - She can return if she wants to. - And you're very stubborn too. We've finished the cola. Hey Moolchand! Hey Moolchand! - What's up? - 2 Colas please. - I've closed for the day. Down the shutter. - Open up if you've closed down. - Am I to stay open all night for you? If you're so interested, you could walk a block to fetch it. - Why don't you fetch some for us? - Am I your servant? - Forget him. He's an illiterate. - What?! An illiterate, am I?! Did you call me an illiterate? Oh yes. I am an illiterate. And I know exactly what I am. Unlike you. You sing in a rotten nightclubs and think you're no less than Elvis. He calls me an illiterate! And he sits drinking in front of his son. You couldn't even take care of your wife. And he is lording it over me! You bloody! What did you say about my wife?! - No! Don't! - What did you say about my wife?! I'll break your face! I will! - Let go! And you! Get lost! - Don't you dare touch me! - Get lost? - Let's go! Just come back here... and I'll show you! - Don't fight! Go home, Moolchand! And you're a strange fellow. Must you pick up a fight with such a scum? - Bad fellow! Come on, let's have a drink. - No, he spoilt my mood. Come home, Sunil. What's it with you, now? Hey! I just fell down. Let's squat here for sometime. Why do you drink rum, Daddy? What did you know about rum? I know everything. Rum is an alcoholic drink. One day, a drunk came to the gates of our school. The kids at school were teasing him and poking fun at him. And everyone threw stones at him. I don't want anyone to make fun of you. Do you love me so much? I love you very much too. I love you more than anyone else on earth. If you love me so much, you must stop drinking. From now on, I won't drink. There's this fatso in our class. Deven. He bullies everyone around. He snatched Prakash's lunch box away. I complained to the teacher. Why complain? Box him in the stomach. That'll do him right. - Well, what will you do to him? - I'll box him in the stomach. Go on now. I'll be back to take you home. I was passing by when I saw the two of you. Sonu was looking quite cheerful. I'd thought I'd call you up sometime. But I decided that it'd be better if I met you personally. How are you? I'm fine, and I don't have much to worry about. How have you been? - Are you very forlorn, Daddy? - No, I'm not. Why do you ask? Nothing particularly. Are you thinking about Mummy? Go to sleep now. - Take a look at this! - What's up? - Read it! - Read? - Read it... see who wrote it! - One Pawan Malhotra. - The film director! - Didn't he direct CHAHAT? -That's him all right! He has signed me up to score the music for his forthcoming film. - What are saying?! - Really?! - Yes! And I can't believe it! Pawan Malhotra patted my shoulder and said... "You're a very talented fellow! How come I didn't meet you before?" He liked my songs very much! Thank God for that. And congratulations! Hey Moolchand! Take a look at this! Get that?! All right. Understood. So you've got money! When are you going to pay me up? I haven't yet received money. I've just signed the contract. I'll get the money soon. Let's celebrate with tea for everyone. - Very well... er... What do you mean? - It's on me, of course. - You should've said so. Come on in. - I'll have a cup of tea too! Are you going to become the greatest music director now? That I'll become. But, do you know what I'm going to do before that? - What? - Your birthday is coming up, isn't it. - Oh yes. - I'll get you a surprise gift for your birthday. - Really? - Yes. - What's it going to be? - How can I tell you about it now? I know what! Isn't it something I showed you the other day? Is it yellow in color? The battery operated car! - Where does Mr. Rohit Kumar live? - I'm Rohit Kumar. Ms. Kiran has sent this for you. It's Mummy's car! Hey folks! Come on quick! Take a look at this. It's my Mummy's car! What's it? It's a letter from Kiran. She wants to celebrate Sonu's birthday. She has invited us over. You'll go over, won't you? Tell her that we will come. But, there's no need to sent the car. Tell her that we will come. But, there's no need to sent the car. You mustn't be naughty, Sonu. And you must speak to everyone politely, understand? - Are you listening to me? - Yes. Okay. If anyone offers you anything to eat, don't be greedy. Refuse it politely. But if you must have it, say thanks afterwards. Sonu has arrived. - I hope we aren't late. - No problem. - I was worried that you wouldn't come. - But, I have come. Let me introduce you... my wife, Lajwanti... and... Mrs. Tolaram. Sorry for leaving you alone for a while. Only a while, wasn't it? - I get childish when I'm with kids. - You've always been childish. Sonu is still cheating at the game. He's just like you! You're looking lovely. Come over here for a moment, Kiran. I'll be back in a moment. Won't you meet others around? We have other guests too. Have you invited everyone to watch you prancing with that fellow? - I'll leave this party if you speak so. - You must consider your status. - You're a star. And, journalists are attending. - Who invited them? I wanted to celebrate a birthday. You've made a circus out of it. Don't teach me what to do and what not to. As of now, just stay away from him. We have other guests here too. - Happy tidings, Mr. Ramdayal. - Thank you. Happy tidings to you too. - Thank you. - What's up? Any problem? - Nothing at all. They might not have taken a liking to my presence. - I should've sent Sonu here alone. - But why? I wanted you to come too. I wanted all of us to celebrate Sonu's birthday together. I've taken a lot of pains to organize this party. And now, these people... ...they've spoilt my mood. - I've asked you not to run around! - Hey fatso! You won't catch me! - Let me go! He'll catch me! - Let him. I got caught because of you! - That's just as well. Now you can sit with Mummy for a while. My child! What's that mark? I was playing on the side. And I fell down. - Oh no! - And it bled a lot. - Did it take stitches? - Yes 8 stitches. How did it happen? My mistake. I wasn't careful. And he didn't listen. It didn't hurt his eyes, thank God! I could never have forgiven myself. - And I didn't even cry. - Really? - Come on, Mummy. I want to see your house. - Let's go. - Come along too, will you? - No. Just go on. - All right. - See you later. - Excuse us. - Greetings. - Greetings. - Have you had the cakes and other goodies? - Yes I have, thank you. - Had enough? - Not yet. I'll have some more. - Seen the villa? - Yes. It's a huge one. It stretches right up to the beach. There's a swimming pool back there. - I see! - It cost a million bucks. - Fantastic. Are you still at song-and-dance at the hotel? Well, you see... - Glory be to The Divine mother. - Greetings, Mr. Gulbadan Kumar. - Greetings. - Happy tidings on your son's birthday. I'm very upset with him, I am! Tell me, is this any way to behave?! You're the sole object of discussion in the film business nowadays. He has scored such lovely songs; and he has put Amar Kaushik to shame! Well, you've become a very important person nowadays. But you mustn't forget simple folks like me. Do call up once in a while. - Never mind that. But you must get me the music rights. - Sure. - Together, we'll make a stupendous success out of it. - Surely. Divine Mother be praised! A heroine and a music director in the family! No dearth of money! I suggest you become a film producer. Say what?! - Excuse me. - Oh yes. - Be back soon. - How many films have you signed? - Just one till now. You'll get many more, I'm sure. But take care about signing films. What'd you like to have? Whisky or rum? I've stopped drinking. May The Divine Mother bless you! A Coca-cola for the gentleman, please. Hello there! Nowadays, you don't seem to care for us. That isn't the case at all. In fact, we were discussing you. After all, he has rising star with him. Mr. Rohit Kumar! The singer and composer. A two-in-one! Congratulations! So even you've got a film! What I don't understand is how he bagged the film. Because there still are people who value caliber. Not names. I see! But I think that behind every successful man lies a woman. But slightly different in this case; ...a successful woman behind the man! - What do you mean? - Can a woman who is beautiful and successful... ...not do as much for her husband? - Surely she can do! - What nonsense are you speaking? - Do you think Pawan Malhotra has... ...signed you because he likes your rotten songs? - We were supposed to sign this film. - You've got it because of your wife. Don't believe it, d'you? Why! It's commonplace. Come here, Mr. Tolaram. - Come here, Mr. Tolaram. - Yes. Come here. - What's up, gentlemen? Tell him... go on! Tell him how he has landed this film. Oh forget it! - Go on, speak up. Tell him! - He has scored some very good songs. - To hell with the songs! You had signed us. - Well yes, I did... - On his wife's say-so, you threw us out! Correct? - Nothing of the sort! - She had merely... - D'you hear that, Mister two-in-one? It happens dear. Everything goes in this business. - People do use their good-looking wives too. - Oh yes. They do. Look... look at what's going on over there. Go on... over there. Someone bashes me up... and you're trying to patch up! What's going on? That's true! He couldn't cook anything. Not even eggs! - Really?! How is it now? - Nowadays he has picked up a few things. - He makes a dish out of potatoes now and then. - Of potatoes?! - Yes. Sometimes, there are excess of turmeric in it. But, I make do. Oh hello, Rohit. Come in. Go downstairs, Sunil. One minute please, daddy, I want to tell mummy... I asked you to go downstairs! What's up, Rohit? Wait for me downstairs. Did you speak to Pawan Malhotra about me? Did you ask him to replace me with Amar Kaushik as a music director? - Why are you asking me this? - Did you tell him, or, didn't you? Give me an answer, Kiran. Yes. - Why? - Because I wanted to help you. I don't want your help! I don't want anyone's help! - Won't I succeed without your help? - That's not the case, Rohit. D'you want to prove that you're so big that you can make anyone? I've never thought of it that way, Rohit. I did it because... ...I know that you can score better music than those fellows. That's what I wanted to prove on my own. And now, you've spoiled everything. People will say that I've succeeded because my wife helped me. My success will never be mine! - I can't do it! - Tell Pawan Malhotra that I won't do this film! Don't lose your head, Rohit. Pawan Malhotra liked your music. That's why he has signed you. I haven't forced him to. What does it matter if a few people tell you a lot of nonsense? I'm your wife. If I don't help you, who else will? I see! So can you walk out on me, or come to my aid at your sweet will? You don't want to help me. You just want to show off your magnanimity. You want to show me how small I am, compared to you. And you want to show your concern for me though you live apart. You've always thought ill of me. You've always got me wrong. Why must I try to understand you in the first place? I don't want to understand you. Nor do I want to see you ever! Don't ever try to meet me again! Stop! Rohit! Don't step inside this house ever again! - Listen to me! Please! Come to your senses! How did all this come here? Look, Daddy! My birthday presents! Mummy sent these over. This is a military jeep. It turns around whenever it collides. Look! Here's a remote control car. Why can't we live in Mummy's house? - Don't you like this house? - This home is fine, but... - What of it? But her house is so big... and it's so nice. She has 3 TV sets. We don't have a single one. What did Mummy tell you at this party yesterday? - She said that she loves me very much. - What did you tell her? That she's the best Mummy on earth. So now you want to live with Mummy, do you? - I'm asking you something. - Do you know something? Mummy is going to buy the battery-operated car for me. - Did you ask her for it? - No, I just told her that I like it. She said that she'd buy it for me. Why did you have to ask her for it? I was supposed to buy it for you. - You haven't got it yet. - But I was to get it for your birthday. - And now, my birthday is gone. - All right. I know that. I'll get you that car today. Understood? I'll get it today! For you. My car is coming today! - How much does that car cost? - 5000 Rupees. - 5000?! - Yes. - It's a bit too much for that car. - Fixed price. Take it or leave it. - An advance of 5000 Rupees?! - I need the money, Sir. So you need all of 5000 Rupees! D'you hear that, Mr. Godwill? You may deduct a thousand rupees every month out of my salary. - It'd be adjusted within 5 months. - Will you be here for 5 months? Seems like you've got a chance to sing in some third rate film. And now, you're looking for chance to give me the slip. No, Sir. That isn't the case at all! I've forgotten these dreams. The only person I have to myself is my 6 year old son. Yesterday was his birthday. And I had promised him a gift. A gift... worth 5000 bucks! D'you hear that. Mr. Godwill?! I've never given a single gift to my son. And my good man wants to give a gift worth 5000 bucks to his son! You've spun a good spiel. But, I'm not one to be taken in my your story. - Please try to understand... - Don't waste my time. And back to work! Let's get working. We don't have a circus happening here, do we? - So you won't let me have the money will you? - Not at all. What are you doing?! I'll call the police! Stop him, Godwill! What hooliganism is this? Put it down on my account. Stop him! Catch him! Snatch the money from him! Know something, aunt Farida? Daddy is getting me a battery-powered car. Is that so? That's good news, I say. It's getting late. Time to have dinner. I won't eat now. I'll eat when Daddy comes home. No knowing when he'll return. I must go home and get my kids to do their homework. - Go on... eat your dinner quickly. - No. I won't eat now. Very well. I'm leaving the food here. Eat it when you feel hungry. When did you return? I didn't even get to know! Where's the car, Daddy? - Why haven't you eaten yet? - I was waiting for you. You mustn't stay awake so late. I don't like this at all. I was waiting so we could eat together. - What's happened, Daddy? - I lost my son. I have lost. Don't cry. - Please don't cry, Daddy. - My son asked me for only one thing. And I couldn't get it for him. This is the worst defeat in my life. I don't want that car, Daddy. Really... I don't want it. Here... I have some money. And I'm going to get more. And I'm going to get that car for you. But, please stop drinking, Daddy. Please. I'll get that car for you, Sonu. I will. - Mr. Pawan Malhotra has summoned me here. - Please follow me. Please forgive me, Rohit. I've had you summoned here using the alias. Else, you wouldn't have come. I want to discuss something. Is anything worth discussing? Please sit down, Rohit. You had told me something the other day. All I want to know is whether... ...it is your final decision. - Why? Are you still firm about not meeting me ever again? Absolutely. - In that ease, I want my son. - What was it you said?! - I want Sonu to live with me. - You want Sonu! Incredible! How could you even think of it? You left him when he needed you. - D'you want me to... - You haven't seen him in a year and a half. You haven't even asked if he's dead or alive. And now you want him! - Sonu needs me. He'll be happy with me. - And, isn't he happy with me? Now wait a minute! D'you mean to say that I can't keep him happy? - I didn't say so. - D'you think you can give him more happiness... ...because you're wealthy? - Please don't shout, Rohit. - Why mustn't I! I'm his mother. And you can't deny my right. Neither can you mine! I'm his father. And he stays with me. I'd even go to court to get Sonu. Well, how do I play that? Just like Daddy, don't I? I'm sorry for having touched the piano, Daddy. In terms of this notice, Ms. Kiran seeks a divorce from you. And, she wants that the child be placed in her custody. All I want is my son. I'll tell you something before I take the case. In such cases, the decision generally favors the mother. I have been parenting him for nearly two years now. - She had abandoned the child. - Yet, Ms. Kiran remains the mother. Besides, she's a successful woman. You don't have a job. That's worse. You'd have to pay for court fees and mine to the extent of 50 or 60,000. That's irrespective of whether you win or lose. D'you have the money? - Yes. Please prepare the brief. - Very well. You may come here on Wednesday at 10 am. We'll discuss the case. Please bring 20,000 towards expenses in advance All right. I can pay 15,000 for all these instruments. The piano is worth at least I should get at least 40,000 for all the instruments. This is business for me. I should be able to earn a bit out of this. - Well, give me at least 25,000. - I can't pay more than 15,000. - Very well, you may leave. - You seem to be cross with me, Sir. We don't want to sell. Now, please leave. It's yours, do as you please. - Please leave. - Excuse me, gentleman. What a waste of time! Why did they call me at all? Have you gone out of your mind? Can a junk dealer appreciate these? You're worrying for nothing. Sell my furniture to raise the money. No. You've already done so much for me. - I'll sell my songs. - Sell your songs?! - To whom? - To Amar Kaushik. You've really gone out of your mind. He's willing to pay me 1000 for every song. Who gets the credit? - They get the credits. - You mustn't do such a thing. These are fruits of your labor. They're your hopes, your dreams. How can you give that away to someone? Your songs are beautiful, Rohit. You must get credit for these songs. That's what I thought too. I thought my songs were beautiful. But, I've tried for so many years. And, no one seems to like them. And, at long last, I think I have been entirely wrong. - My songs might really be worthless. - I don't agree to that. - You're making a big mistake, Rohit. - I may be. But, if in exchange... ...for these, I can have Sonu, then these songs are priceless. Else, these are no more than scribbling on paper. The filmfare award for the Best music director, this year for... ...the song DIL MERA CHURAYA KYON goes to Amar Kaushik. Mr. Rohit Kumar's attorney has sent me this letter today. He has agreed to divorce Ms. Kiran. But he has refused the prayer to place Ms. Kiran's son Sunil Kumar... ...under her custody. The case therefore rests upon the contention... ...as to who may have custody of the child. Before arguing the case... ...I'll present some witnesses. - This lawyer is a tough one. I shall speak the truth, and nothing but the truth. Can you tell the court something about your daughter, Mrs. Ramdayal? My daughter is a simple girl, and has all the qualities of a girl... ...who has had a respectable upbringing. She's an obedient girl. Why then, did she marry Rohit Kumar against your wishes? That's the only mistake she has committed in all her life. And, she's still suffering for her mistake. This man had treated her so cruelly that... ...she was forced to leave his house at midnight. Thank you Mrs. Ramdayal. You may step down. Can you tell the court about Rohit Kumar's character, Mr. Ramdayal? What can I say about a man who has no character? He's a scoundrel; and he's wayward. You mustn't consider his appearance. He inveigled my daughter using those looks, and with his words. - Really?! - He claimed to be a singer of great caliber. And he said that he was going to become a famous music director. He's still where he was. And look at my daughter! She came out, and now, she's so successful. And we don't want... ...Sonu to live with him, because the boy will turn wayward. Has Rohit Kumar ever shied away from fulfilling his responsibilities? - No. - Has he ever tried to shirk responsibility? - No. - Has he been negligent towards his son? - Never. In fact, he spends... ...most of his time with his son. He plays with the boy; amuses him;... ...reads stories to him and takes him outdoors. Sunil is his very life. I've seen very few fathers who would do as much for their children. Thank you very much, Mrs. Farida. For how many years have you known Mrs. Kiran? Some 7 years now. Has Ms. Kiran ever told you about her personal life? Questions about Ms. Kiran's personal life may be addressed to her only. - Did she tell you anything about her personal life. - Yes. - What? - She was unhappy. - With whom was she unhappy? - She was unhappy about Rohit. - Did Ms. Kiran ever tell you... ...that Rohit Kumar doesn't care about his son at all? Please reply, Ms. Farida. I haven't yet heard you. Yes. But, that had happened before Kiran left. - Maybe. But he... ...didn't care about his son at all. Now, Ms. Farida, can you tell me... ...if you ever advised Ms. Kiran to break away? - No. I did not. did you not tell her that: "If you are so unhappy, it'd be better for you to leave"? Yes. But I never thought that she'd really do something like that. "If you are so unhappy, it'd be better for you to leave Rohit" Kiran was a good friend. And, I was concerned about her. I still am. - And whatever I told her... - Was born out of your feeling that... ...had Kiran lived on with Rohit, she would've gone mad or could've... ...had a nervous breakdown, or she may have even been driven to suicide. - But I... - D'you want an innocent child to live with such a man! You're making a big mistake, Kiran. Rohit has changed completely. He is no more what he used to be. Listen to me, Kiran. Please! Don't take Sonu away from Rohit. He needs Sunil. Without him... Please don't do this to him. If you do not step down, it will be regarded as a contempt of this court. I can't quite understand how you're going about this case, Mr. Bhatija. At this rate, we're going to lose... out of the way, please. Our witnesses are saying the truth. And her lawyer is twisting facts. D'you want me to tell lies too? Must I stoop to Bhojwani's level? D'you want me to raise a stink over Ms. Kiran's personal life? Am I to prove that she's deranged? Must I accuse her of adultery? - But that isn't true! - Are you concerned about the truth? Or, do you want your son? Tell me. I'll handle the case accordingly. I can present false witnesses as he does. Do you want me to do that? No. Do it honestly. Look at her now. She has done well for herself. She's the ideal woman. My next witness is Mr. Moolchand Gangar. - Where did he transpire from? - I have no idea. - Who is he? - The grocer in my neighborhood. - We don't get along too well. - You haven't told me about him. - Is your shop located under Rohit Kumar's residence? - Exactly. In that case, you might be knowing Rohit well. Very well indeed. - I've heard that he buys groceries from your shop on credit. - Always. - He might also be settling your dues. - No. - Doesn't he?! Why then do you still let him enjoy your credit? I allow credits to everyone. You buy from me and you get credit. Did you threaten to lodge a complaint with the police, when... ...he had gotten drunk and beaten you up? If I told tales about your wife, you would've bashed are up too. Does it mean that you aren't a good man? It's not a question of being good or bad. It's more a matter of intent. - Now, did he pay you up after the incident? - No, he didn't. Now how does a man run his household under the circumstances? How can such a person look after his son? You mean his son, Sunil? - Yes. - He'd give his life for Sunil. He loves his son very much. He loves his son more than I can ever love my son. Love can't satiate hunger. And what can one who has wrecked his home... ...provide for his son? - Rohit Kumar has not wrecked his own family. It's she... that woman sitting over there? She has wrecked the family! Please answer questions put to you. Do not try to give a verdict. Forgive me if I have erred. This is my first ever appearance in court. - I came here because he summoned me. - You may leave now. What you say is true. I've hated Rohit Kumar for not repaying me. I've even quarreled with him for my money. But my money isn't the bone of contention. This is about his son. You asked me what he'd do for his son. Well, he has sold himself! It might be easy for Ms. Kiran to foot the bill for this lawsuit. She's a famous heroine. And she has loads of money. But, it wasn't easy for Rohit. Do you know what he did for his son? He sold his life's savings... his music... to Amar Kaushik. They are now taking credit for his music. - Rohit Kumar must've told you that. - No he didn't. But I know better. I've heard all his songs so often, it's still coming out of my ears. The song "RAJ A KO RANI SE PYAR HO GAYA"...it's Rohit's. I'm telling you the truth! The song wasn't written by Amar Kaushik. - Do you love your son? - Yes. I love him dearly. Why did you leave him? He used to think that I'll remain a failure. It ruined my confidence. I became fatalistic about my failures. I was confused, and I started losing my confidence. I felt stifled and confused. I was scared. And I left my home. Then, I'd thought it better for Sunil's sake not to take him along. Why then do you seek custody of your son now? I know I had deserted him. I can never forgive myself for the mistake. But, the situation has changed. And, I am confident of myself. I can look after Sonu very well. After all I reared him for 5 years. Must my child be taken away from me because I've been away for 2 years? He needs me now. But I don't say that he doesn't need his father. But, he's still a child. He needs a mother more than he needs a father. And, I'm his mother. I'm his mother! You've spent nearly 6 years with your husband. - Has he ever manhandled you? - No. He hasn't. - Did he use abusive language? - No. - Has he ever ill-treated your son? - No. - Do you regard your husband to be a drunkard? - No. Has he ever had relations with other women... in the nature of infidelity? - No. - Then, the reason for your desertion becomes amply clear. With whom did you have the longest lasting relationship before marriage? - With my parents. - And you spent some 22 years with them. - Yes. But, you married Rohit Kumar against their wishes. Right? Yes. That's because I loved Rohit. With whom, apart your parents have you shared the longest relationship? - With my son Sunil, I think. - You spent 5 years with him. And you've met him only once afterwards! Now consider your husband. Don't you think you've shared a... ...very long relationship with him? I didn't hear you, Ms. Kiran. - Yes. - And how many years in all, prior to your marriage... ...and afterwards have you shared this relationship with him? - Nearly 7 years. - 7 years! Which means that you have failed... ...to sustain a relationship by marriage, a social institution... ...that is held holy and of irrevocable bondage in our culture! - Please state your reply, Ms. Kiran. - Tell us, Ms. Kiran... D'you agree that you've failed to sustain the relationship. - No, I didn't fail. - Didn't you?! Would you rate this as a success? - Your marriage is on the rocks. - We have failed each other. Not "both of us", Ms. Kiran. It's you. You have failed! You walked out on your husband. He didn't. You failed the relationship. - It's the marriage which failed. - Not the marriage. You failed! You've failed to sustain the most precious relationship of your life. Is that true? Or, isn't it? - Say it aloud. I didn't hear you. Is it true? Or, isn't it? - Yes. She walked out on her parents after 22 years. She walked out on her husband for 7 years. What guarantee that she won't desert her child after another 2 or 3 years? D'you think that your case stands weakened now? You haven't lost a single suit till date, Mr. Bhojwani. - But it seems that you're going to lose this one. - No comments please. Generally, It's the woman who is favored in disputes like this. That's because she's a woman and a mother. But presently, the questions revolve around the child. As I understand, this Court will decide in the child's interest... ...about what's good for Sunil. I've been looking after him for nearly 2 years now. I've learnt something. And, I have understood much. And slowly, I've understood what it takes to be a good father. It takes patience. One needs to spend a lot of time with the child. For hours, I've heard him talk of strange fantasies. I'd get tired of listening to him. But, I'd go on listening despite. One must reply to a thousand questions he has to ask. One must be there with him whenever need be, so he might not feel lonely. To do all that, one must love. And I don't know where it's written that a woman can love more than a man. Must a mother always love the child more than the father? I do not say that the child cannot have a better upbringing. I've always tried my best. Sometimes I'd scold him and he'd go to bed with a heavy heart. Up next morning, we'd have breakfast together and we'd laugh and talk. It was all as if nothing had happened. Later, I'd drop him to school. And while returning from school... ...he would tell me about what had happened all day in school. We used to dine together. And afterwards I'd tell him stories. We've created a world for ourselves. And it took a lot of love to do that. If this is destroyed, we can never build it again. Don't do this, Kiran. Please don't do this to me again. You've told the court that it must decide in the interest of your son. Yes. Did you work at the Copper Chimney restaurant when you met Ms. Kiran? - Yes, - How much salary did you draw then? But, you were dismissed from the job, weren't you? I wasn't dismissed. I left that job of my own volition. You left the job! And I thought that people take... ...on greater responsibilities aftermarriage! I wanted to rise in life. I wanted to become a successful singer. You must've received several offers for singing. I did get an offer from Amar Kaushik. From Amar Kaushik! Lovely! But I don't think you have sung in any of his films. Or, have you? I had dropped the film. - Left that too! Why? Differences had cropped up between us. I see... differences! And what did you do afterwards? - I went back to the earlier job. - At Copper Chimney? - Yes. And how much salary were you paid? I didn't hear you, Mr. Rohit. How much salary were you paid? - 2500 rupees. - 2500?! Down from 3000 to 2500! You're the first person ever to climb down the ladder to success. And I do not think it to be in your son's interest. On September 13, you tried to rob 5000 rupees from the cashier. No. I didn't try to rob. I was asking for a loan. You tried to take the money forcibly. And when waiters in the restaurant... ...tried to apprehend you, you fought with them physically. I was merely taking a loan. And I had intended to repay it. Not only fisticuffs. Furniture was broken and the restaurant losses. For the crime, Mr. Rohit Kumar had spend some time in a police-lockup. - Is it so, or, isn't it? - Why don't you try to understand? Please reply to my question in the affirmative or the negative. I'm trying to give a reply. And I can't do that in a mere "yes" or "no". I was taking an advance. It was to be deducted form my salary. My son had asked for gift on his birthday. And, I promised the gift. Stop shouting! Else, this court holds you for contempt. Were you confined in the police lock up, or, weren't you? - Yes. I was confined. - Good. - Now, do you consider yourself to be a responsible father? - Yes. Was your son was about to lose an eye because you were irresponsible? Was your son Sunil about to lose an eye? He was playing in the park. And he fell down. He fell down because you were careless! - And he was about to lose on eye! - It was an accident. - It could've happened to anyone. - Didn't you tell Ms. Kiran that he... ...fell down because you were careless... ...and that he was about to lose an eye? Tell us, Mr. Rohit, is it true? Or, isn't it? - Yes. - Do you concede that your son could've lost an eye for your fault? Yes. I had no idea that my lawyer would drag that into the court. He had asked me a lot of question. I had merely answered his questions. I know you aren't at fault. Please believe me. I didn't do it willingly. After hearing the depositors made by witnesses, this court has decided... ...that the child Sunil Kumar be placed under Mrs. Kiran's custody. Vacations start from today. It's a month long vacation! We'll go to Matheran during the vacation, won't we? - Would you like an ice-cream? - No. I want an ice-candy. - Come on. Do you know something. Daddy? All the kids in my class are going... ...to Simla on a school trip. But, I'm not going with them. I'll go to Matheran with you. We'll have lots of fun out there, won't we? We'll fly kites over there. And I will carry the cricket kit with me too. I want to tell you something. This is a present from me. It's a seasoned ball. Do come over to play cricket. We'll have a match. Oh yes. You'll play for my team. And we'll beat the grocer's team. - Mr. Ramdayal called up to say that the car is coming. - I see. Carry the luggage down. Let's go downstairs. Don't cry, Sonu. Come on. You'll enjoy yourself at Mummy's house. You'll have lots of toys over there. And I'll come down to see you too. - Take him down, Farida. I'll be with you in sometime. - Very well. Where's your bat, Sunil? Where's your bat? He must've forgotten it. I'll fetch it. - Come along, son. Sonu has gone downstairs. - I want to tell you something, Rohit. - What? This is Sonu's bat. He forgot to take it. I bought a full cricket kit yesterday. Why?! Isn't this bat good for him anymore? No. It's just that I remembered that Sonu is fond of cricket. Not only that. I've bought him all the toys he could ever want. I've made him a room that looks just like the one here. The same bed; a small table; and a similar cupboard. And I've painted the walls the same shade of color. All because I want to make Sonu feel at home. And then I realized that this is his home. A few articles can't make a home for anyone. Sonu stays here. This is his home. Over the past few days, our lives and our sentiments were laid bare. You must've been hurt. I know that. And today I know that nothing matters more than the relationship. I'm sorry for everything that has happened. You're staying here, Sonu... with your father. This is your home. This is your home too.@#
