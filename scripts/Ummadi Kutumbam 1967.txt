What a surprize! l'm not seen by ordinary mortals except very wise and pious souls. How could this lady see me? But still... Why are you looking at me soulfully? You may've been astonished by seeing my luminous body. But still l'll take the life. Lord Vishnu's serpent bed may also tilt... The holy four Vedas may go wrong... Lord Shiva may miss a step in his celestial dance... Goddess of learning's veena may play a wrong note... l'm Yama, the lord of death who will never miss to take a life on time... Don't move, you idiot. How can l not move if ants bite me? Savithri, l'm taking your husband's life. Hubby...hubby... Bull, let's go! Are you going away, Lord Yama? Without any mercy, are you taking away my husband's life... What's this pious lady's courage? Though her courage is praiseworthy for following me to this dangerous path. lt's futile! l'll try to dissuade her. One! Path filled with sharp stones that could cut your legs... Snakes that hiss and raise hood to sting at the slightest sound... Chill waters of river that can curdle your blood... Wind that blows sharply can tear your ear drums... Pitch dark paths that you can't see is full of deadly beasts... Return back leaving your husband... Why don't you listen to me, O young lady? Please go back, young lady... You mustn't and shouldn't follow me... So thick forest that ants can't enter, so dark that crows can't enter... Even if you cry for help... No use... please go back silently... l'm surprized by the lady's perseverance. Not only crossed deadly forests but climbing dangerous mountains following me. l'll try to instill fear and dissuade her. Are you deaf not to hear me? Why are you so adamant? What do you think of yourself? Who do you think l am? l'm Lord of Death, the Yama... She's no ordinary woman! O lady Savthri! - Lord! Now comes the path that no human can cross. River Vaitharini which only very pious human souls can cross. Lord, you're a man of justice! l've followed you till this place, is it good to send me empty handed? What should l do then? She's right! l'll show mercy and grant her a boon. Pious lady! l'm extremely happy with your perseverance. Ask any boon other than your husband's life, l'll grant it. l think iron heart is melting, why should l lose the opportunity? lt's said that for a woman, her ln-law's place is heaven. Lord Yama! - Yes. My parents'-in-law are struggling in forest without vision and... l'm granting them a kingdom along with eye sight. Why is she still following me? l'll not lose anything by granting such harmless boons, right? l'll grant her another boon and cajole her to turn back. Since you're a lady and it's not right to send you back with one boon only, l've decided to grant you another boon, that too anything other than your husband's life. Now he has come to my way. Why should l leave this opportunity? l'll help my parents. Lord! My parents don't have a son... l'm granting 100 son to them, go back now happily. l asked one boon and you granted a second one. ls it justice for not granting a third boon, Lord? l didn't get this idea. Anyway she said this is last wish. Let me grant it. Savithri, ask anything other than your husband's life. Please grant me a boon of children. - Granted! Go! How can l go? - Why not? You can't go without giving my husband's life. What? Can't l go? Bull! Go! What's this wonder! My bull which never fears to march ahead even if any angel, God, or demon stops it, but why is it stopping today in fear facing an ordinary lady? l thought you were a pious lady, are you a sorceress? This is not sorcery but an act of seeking justice. Justice? Justice which l don't know! Justice above me? How is it possible? Gods and angels can have children how ever... But how can pious women have children without husband? Don't you know this, Lord Yama? l came thinking she's a pious lady but didn't expect she'll be so clever, had l knew it before l would've sent my assistant. No use in musing the past. So...pious lady Savithri... l'm pleased with love for your husband and good presence of mind, take your husband's life, accept it. For confusing and winning over me, may your name get eternal fame. live happily for long years with husband, after that come to my world... sorry not mine, may you find eternal place in heaven. God bless you! Oh God! Brother! Are you playing drama here leaving work in the farm? Provisions as usual, sugar 6 kgs, flour 4.5 kgs, no 5.25 kgs. Lord! The delay l make to pay and the wrong accounts you show is tallied, l'm not stopping you, carry on reading. Sir, mother promise! Ask your mother. Will God keep quiet if l write wrong accounts? What has he done to anyone without keeping quiet, poor God? You came in as soon l stepped in, how did you know l was here? l know you will come today, l also know your brother Dr. Mukunda Rao will come here tomorrow. Lord! How can l run a business if l don't keep tabs? Tell me, what's that you don't know? How much you're paying now for the due? l can't pay anything now. - How can you say like that sir? Festival days, l need to get stock. l'll arrange something before leaving, it's getting dark, you go now. Your mercy, my gain. l'll take leave now sir. Lord! How long will this burden of dues carry on? Not very long, mother. Mukund has become a doctor. lf starts earning, it'll ease. Did you come just now, brother? How's the harvest this year? Will it cover the costs? - l don't think so. All work no profit. We are facing what this country is facing. Lord! My fate! No use! Useless waste paper and account statements. Always worries about brothers only, never cares for wife and son. What are you searching, mother? - My foot and your ditch! Mother! Did you find anything? l got it! Give the milk to your father. Go. Grandma, drink this milk. - That's for your father, dear. Mother will give him, you have it, grandma. Lord! Don't know about your sons and daughters-in-law, but l'm sure grand children will take good care of you. That's what l wish, son. Have it, dear. Oh God! Hey, it's me! l'm scared, uncle! Remove that moustache first. Moustache? Oh my God! Seeing your elder uncle, got scared and ran away with make up. Remove all that, let's have food. Go! You smell great today. Flowers you got for me. Though l've everything but no one to care about me. No use in having wishes, you must have means to fulfill them. Mad girl! Materialistic things are useless. lt's the inner beauty that counts. lt's hot and spicy, uncle! - Let's have buttermilk, get it. Butter is stored in the pot for elder uncle, let's have it. Let's have it, boy! l can't reach the pot, bend, l'll climb on your shoulders. Get on the box. That's it, boy! Take the pot! Why did you try to take it? Wouldn't l help if you'd called me? l didn't want to add burden after slogging entire day. Sit here. Don't act smart. Would l sleep after having food before entire family eats? So, it means you haven't yet eaten. The bull becomes lazy after getting fat. Both elder sisters-in-law have become lazy after your arrival. They will realise when m doctor brother comes, and shifts family to a big palatial bungalow in city, and when you enjoy a queen's life, they will come to sense then... Did you hear that? They will live like royals and we are slaves. Do we've children to slog for others? Are we doing it for strangers? Why are you raking up that now? Sister-in-law will scold, sleep now. Feeling cold, uncle. Won't it be cold in winter? Let's cover with sheets. Move son! Oh my son! Where is he? Hubby... What's it?- lt's me. - What?- Where's our son? Son? Will he be with you always, people sleep in the coziest place they feel. Don't worry, you go to sleep now. - Stop it. You all are one but l'm stranger, you all are one, trying to take away my son from me. l'll not let it happen. Lord! Oh sister-in-law! l told you to be good but you insist on being bad. Sister-in-law! He's getting spoiled because of you, come...come crazy boy. Sister-in-law! Sleep here! l told you to sleep here but you want to sleep with your uncle. What are you doing? lt's not patting but thrashing. You go to sleep. Can't you sleep without that torn sheets and dirty bed? Close your eyes! With your thrashing he'll not sleep even on a flower bed. lt'll burn him. l'm getting sleep. Lord! My doctor brother! - Greetings sir. That's doctor. Third son Mukunda Rao. So what if he's? He's a doctor with degree. What if he has a degree? lt nothing but just a permission to take lives.- That's all. One becomes a doctor after killing many. Well said, my junior! ln city, it's okay, but here if anything goes wrong they'll take him to task. No use if you've a degree and start a dispensary. What about hand? - Hand? l mean lucky hand! One swallow doesn't make a summer. That's it. - That's where l come in. He must start practice and hit big time, only then... My future is good, l'll never lose my patients. Let me see it. Every man has a disease! Are you done with you studies? l've got a job also, brother. Rs.900 salary. l'll get about Rs.1500 with allowances, Rs.1500? - Rs.1500? Your father-in-law sold his property to make you a doctor, you made it. Keep the luggage here and freshen up. Will he really get Rs.1500? Why are you shocked? lf God's merciful, income is unlimited just by touching a patient. My brother has become a govt. doctor. l heard it. No use with his achievements, we can only see not enjoy the benefits. Dear, serve this coffee to him. Just a coffee? Your husband is here after years and you.... Had it been a city wife, she would help in remove coat, tie, hug me sweetly and say hello... Shameless! Neither l'm educated nor a modern city girl. 2Coffee is getting cold, mother-in-law sent it for you, if l get late, she may think bad, please take it. So, this coffee is also mother's mercy not a wife's affection. ls it a coffee? Prepared it with fresh milk. Goat milk would've been better. Shall we go out in the evening? - Go out? Does your world stop with this room? You know how exciting it would be to walk around the pond in evening breeze. lt will be, this village finds fault even if l go to a neighbour for a friendly visit, if we walk around ponds and farms... - lf we do... Yes, coming mother-in-law. Lord! You're a good omen indeed. Madam. - Keep it there. Junior... Looks like your husband is here, what did he bring for you, madam? Though you may hide today, l'll tell what it is by tomorrow. Foolish girl. Where's my sari? Washed and ironed it. What's that? What else can this poor lady offer you, madam? Are you still here? l'll take care of it, you go dear. Hasn't taken rest from morning, go now. Not for me, mother asked me to bring it stealthily. Go. Sister! Water! - Wait, l'm coming. Disturbing me now. Sister, washed bed spread is here. - Give it. l can't hold it anymore, l can't bear this separation. My heart stealer! l've waited with patience. Won't you take me into your arms and quench my desire thirst? Won't you show mercy on me? - Who are you? Who am l? O dear, l'm Rama of Ayodhya, son of King Dasaratha, scion of lkshvaku dynasty, your husband, have you forgotten me? Where's my brother-in-law Lakshmana? Since he was a disturbance between our love, l sent him to Ayodhya. What about the exile and this get up? l came to you with great desire and forgot to change, dear. l don't believe it. At this odd hour, that too in an odd place, what's this strange behaviour? He's a cheat. lf l'm pious and devoted wife of Lord Rama, may he show up his real self. ls it you crap? May you go to hell, bloody! Yenki, behave properly. You're donning Goddess Seetha's role. Accept me, l'm King of Lanka... Stop romancing me, beware death awaits you... l've stopped advances from many great beauties for you... Don't try to covet other's woman... lt's a sin... Seek Lord Rama's mercy... Eight directions are under my command... Rama is just a human, don't talk great about him... When Rama's arrow pierces through you in the battlefield... Let me see who comes to save your life... Beware, l'm getting angry with your attitude. But still... l gave you ten days time, don't create trouble... Become mine... lf you refuse, l'll not spare you... Even if Lord Shiva himself stops me, l'll not stop, lady... Greetings! What's new monkey get up? This is not make up, mother, indeed l'm a monkey. l'm Hanuman, friend of Sugriva, ambassador of Rama, take this to check my identity. Ring! Ring...ring...ring that adorns the finger of my husband... When will Rama come here and kill Ravana... When will my misery end, O ring... Goddess Seetha, don't worry... Let it be mighty ten headed Ravana or anyone... l'll crush them, don't worry... Today's show was great. This is last scene, pray God to give a riveting performance. Watch out! Do you want me to pray?- Pray! Lord Anjaneya... Fix the tail properly. - Fix it well. That's it! That's enough. What about my thirst? - Get it. ls it easy to do Hanuman's role? That's better, watch out now. Light fire to my tail! Light fire to it. Where's my tail? Hail Lord Rama! l'm son of Wind God... l'll destroy the army of demons and she demons... Hail Lord Rama! Your bad time has started, that's why you got bad ideas... You kidnapped Goddess Seetha, l'm here to teach you a lesson... As thick smoke spreads and raging fires leap into sky... l'll burn down Lanka and teach a lesson to arrogant Ravana... Tail...tail... - Mad man, you're really burning it down. Run...escape, he has burnt it... Where are you? Coming...coming... Apply on my back. Why did you go away? Okay. Greetings sir. What brings you here? Why are you doing it yourself sir? Busy with work, in future one must do it all by himself. Well said sir. Sir, you won't face it sir. - Why? Leave it, l'll give you a good oil massage. Will you do it? You know to do it? You know? - Why not sir? You can't do properly anything. - How can l not do this? Not bad... your hands are magical... You're doing good. lt's cool! - What do you think of me? Sir, that's my hand. Hey, that's my back, not your washing stone. He's tough, he gets carried away easily. Who? - He! That's why people say washerman is better than educated man. But not him. Yes sir, he got ruined the day he put grease paint. l got completely ruined because of her, sir. Lord! Hey, you're pushing me falling for her. That's the way l'm ill treated here. People are jealousy of me. Others get good saris and this cheap one for me. What can they do for your incompetence? l would also be good if my husband is some clerk or doctor. Why are you talking so harsh on a festival day? Truth! l know about everyone here, son is relative but not his wife, showing partiality, they gave a cheap sari because l'm a farmhand's wife. Elder son bought three saris for festival, l sent it to three daughters-in-law, l didn't show any partiality. l too didn't buy different ones, all three are same variety, mother, same price, hand woven saris. Show him the price tags to your uncle, same quality and same price. Had it been in the same colour, there would be no trouble. This differences wouldn't crop up. Go in. Creating trouble on festive day, what would my brother and mother think? Wear it. Till now we managed this family by writing accounts and farming activities, with low salary and low yields, it couldn't even cover the interest, so l've leased out the land this year, sold off the cattle to settle small loans. How to run this family? - Nothing to worry, Mukund has started working, with high salary, l think we are in for good days ahead. Okay, l don't have any objection. Hubby! What? Lower your voice. Pickles, take it carefully. Don't touch it with wet hands. Savories and sweets, these are for munching. Have you kept anything for other family members? Shut up, they are eating like bandicoots here. Anyway l'm not lucky to be with you, atleast eat sweetmeats prepared by me thinking about me. Whatever l do eat or anything l'll think...- What? Lord! Always worried about home, kitchen, and household work. l came here thinking this is heaven with a lovely wife. This is hell! l'll not stay here for a minute also. Are you also leaving? - Yes brother. You said you've a week's time. l must find a house to live. - Right. Going to new place, a day earlier the better. l don't understand your attitudes, jobs and leaving home. Parting away. Can we avoid after accepting a job, mother? Bye mother. lt's time to leave. Venkat hasn't come to take luggage, how will it reach station? Will your journey stop if he doesn't come? We are two, we'll carry it. Are you ready? - Ready.- Carry it. Carry under arms. Guru! Yenki is here. Junior, ironed clothes. l'm busy, go inside and collect it. Your clothes. When did you come in? - Behind you. You look tired! - Tired? l'm fine. Give me your hand. - You want to see? See. Why are you shivering? - Shivering? Who? Hey junior! Why are you nervous? - Nothing. Where's my Yenki? - How do l know? She didn't come here. How come? She said she's coming here with clothes. May be gone to the neighbour's house. What? Junior! - What? Come here for a minute. - Why? Nothing, want to tell you something. Come dear. - What man? What's that shining in the corner? - Which corner? My tuft! My tuft! Don't stop me. Why are you beating him? Come hubby. Your life is saved, trying to act smart with me. Guru, he's gone. l got the stick. Thank God! l was scared to death fearing he'll come in. She didn't allow him to come in. By the way did you... Very smart girl! Never let me touch her. lt's decided, she's on our side. Why are you also joining me? Guru, she's on your side. Don't get smart with me. She doesn't know English. My dear... Doctor, save me! - Who are you? You must come immediately, sir. l'm getting late to hospital, l can't come now. Very serious sir, if you delay a life may go, sir. Get into the car. You can go. Where's the patient? Before you! Your suffering from? You're the doctor, you should tell that. No fever. - But l feel temperature. Since when? - Since my eyes saw you. Clever girl! - lf you catch it. How many times l told you to be careful? Why would she be careful when her husband earns well? She'll get new sari if old one is burnt. Not only get new silk saris but tie down hubby too. Oh God! Don't know what she used to prepare those savories? lt's stinking! Just now she ate food, already munching hot dogs. What sort of a woman she is! Any letter atleast today, Ramu? - No, mother. lt's many days since he left, he said he gets Rs.1500 salary. Though high salary, you'll get it after a month only, mother. Moreover you've to pay in advance three months rent in city. He has to buy other things too. Moreover my brother is a government doctor. Hat, boots, suits, needs many things. Can't he write about taking a house on rent and sending his wife there? What if we write it ourselves? Sister-in-law, mother wants me to write a letter to brother. l can't write properly. Write something to move his heart. Write about pangs of separation... What's that son? - Nothing, mother. Seeking blessings, l write this... Old model letter. Elder brother-in-law didn't come. Younger brother-in-law... Okay...okay... next house maters... Everything as usual. Send money to mother-in-law immediately. l humbly request to pardon if there are any mistakes. From your humble wife. Taking my life. Need urgently! lf not l'll lose my respect. l'll return it in near future. Yours lovingly. How much? - Give her. Take it. Your husband wrote a letter, right? What did he write? Did he buy any jewels for you? Will all husbands be like our husbands? Educated and earning husband. Yes, one can save or buy jewels only when he's earning. ls it chain or bangle? No, he has bought a golden sickle to cut my throat. Sickle? How arrogant! Are you making fun of my husband because he works with sickle? Sister! Though your husband earns well, how dare you call my husband names. Some earn and some save. Who is saving? What am l saving? Why are you getting angry? Clever ones are indeed saving. We are not smart, that's we spend everything for this family. We are also toiling and giving to this family only. Okay, you too say it, that we are farm hands. We are uneducated. We are cheap to everyone here. What's all this? Your lenience brought all this. Though her husband is doctor, how dare he makes fun of us. So proud in so short time. What's the trouble here? My life is in trouble. Our lives are miserable, that's why l'm taking all insults silently. What happened now? Your sister-in-law got a letter. l asked if it was from brother-in-law and what did he write? She said he has brought a golden sickle. l can take it because l'm a house wife. You're a man who runs this family, how can she make fun of you? You work with sickle, right? lf l don't work with it, nobody here can eat. Never sends a penny to home, what makes her so proud? Money stashed away in suitcases and banks accounts. Why are you blabbering nonsense? Though not as clever as you, you needn't show your smartness on her, she's not your slave to take stick from you. Unable to digest free meals, trying to pick up fights. Shut up and go inside. You make me shut, that's why they are bossing over me. You shut up, l'll take them to task. What will you do? Go inside. Calm down. You beat or scold me, l don't care, l can't take it anymore from them. l can't live in this house anymore. What do you want me to do? Can't avoid it any more. Let's live separately. Have you gone mad? We don't have any children, why should we toil for others? My mother pampered me. Today l'm struggling here. My brother adores you. Why should we toil for a meal here? Let's go away from here, l'll not drink a drop of water also here. Okay, let's go. No payments.- What about Parvathi? She hasn't paid interest too till now. She paid the principle too, here's the account. Paid it. Couldn't you lend it to someone else? How can l without your permission? Sundaraiah wants Rs.30000. Will he pay 10% interest? He's in financial problems, he'll give anything. Few more people too want it. Find good clients, let's see. l've two bags too. Doctor lends money. Watch your step! Bye sister. What happened brother? Bye sister. Nothing...l'll go, sister. What's that nasty habit of making fun of elders? You brat! l'll beat you. Brother-in-law, meeting you after many days. Lord! Facing you on reaching home, is everyone fine in home? Everyone's fine. - Okay then. Please come and sit here. l'll come in a minute. Greetings sir. - Greetings. Greetings sir. - Greetings. Greetings sir...greetings. They've come to give their daughter to Ramu in marriage, though not very rich, not poor either. Decent family, girl is well mannered and knows all household work. lf you get him also married, l'll be relieved. l'll send coffees. - Okay. Marriage for Ramu? l'm asking you. How will you do it? Who will bear the cost? They have come on their own, if we refuse may not get another. Marriage for that useless boy? Should we've to bear all the burden? Your brother doesn't bother, that city guy never sends a penny, if you spend everything on this family, what will you leave for your son? A begging bowl? Elders are sitting outside, calm down. What else can l do other than keeping silent? Why are you surprized? Just had few pegs only. Got a cigar? Got any beedi? - No. Got any cigarette then? - l don't smoke. Don't smoke? Why do you live then? Sporting big moustache, who is he? Wrestler in our place. - Shall we have a duel? You've come in silk clothes! Came with a marriage proposal. Proposal? What did he tell about groom? Told great about him, hard working and gentleman, many good things. He'll tell good only because he's a good man himself. Why should l take the sin on me? 100 lies are also not a sin to conduct a marriage, l'm going. Please come and sit here, sir. How can l sit when elders are standing? You too sit down. Why are you embarrassing me? Please let me go. Sit here...tell us the truth. Please let me go. - Please... You want me to tell the harsh truth? - Yes. Shall l tell? Groom is...don't tell anyone l told you. Groom is a drunkard. He smokes cigars and cigarettes. He's a goon. Loafer, lazy bugger. Never works, infact doesn't know any work. That's why no one dared to give their daughter in marriage to him. That's why, searching outside. Though you say so much... l swear on you l'm telling truth. Trust me, only a drunkard will tell truth. Who are you? - Me... l'm his brother. His brother? - l mean the groom. Very good boy. Only a drunkard will tell the truth. - That's it. We'll take leave. - Come, let's go. Don't ever come back. What have you done, brother? l've done a good deed, brother. l'm living on you without any education or job. Do l need marriage now? Only a man with job must marry and take a wife. Good for nothing guys like me don't need marriage. This is the only help l can do for the family, mother. Mother, l came with great hope. l'm going back with heavy heart. What can you do if the time is not favourable? lt seems you sent your wife to her parents' home. Yes brother. l'm also going after informing you. ls it? Anyway no farming activity here. Cattle has been sold off. l don't have anything to do here other than getting chided. l can atleast work elsewhere to earn a meal. Okay, anyway you've decided, l've nothing to tell you. Okay, as you like it. This house is in for bad time. Lord! Though l lost my husband, l lived for my children, though l've four sons, l thought you'll conduct my last rites, why are you parting ways when l'm still alive, son? Washerman is better than an educated man... Yenki, what the elders said are indeed golden words... Everyone is same for the river... Castes and religions are same... While washing clothes on river bank... Coarse or fine clothes are same... Only good remains unchanged... - Say like that... Word stands test of time... We wish good and prosperity of generous families... Hold your sari end. 3 measures. Check it properly, don't accuse me later. Look, Rs.2 and 3 annas for a measure, that's Rs.6 and 56 paise for 3 measures. Rs.2 and 3 annas for a measure, that's Rs.6 and... For 3 measures... That's Rs.6 and paise 57, give another paise. lt's 56 paise. - No, 57 paise. lt's Rs.6 and paise 56 only. Study your lessons only. Coming, mother-in-law. Move. What's it, mother-in-law? Not a grain in house, give me some money if you have. Money with me? How can l keep money without your knowledge? Grandma, mother has plenty of money, 3 measures cost Rs.6 and paise 56 only. How dare...you little brat! Why do you beat him, sister-in-law? Childishness, that's why he told truth. Advising me? Can't work, can't feed your mother, how dare you advice me? Come in, brat! More precious than lands and farms, precious than diamonds and jewels, precious than King's crown, precious than life, that which is most valuable for a woman, most holy thing for her, l'm pawning it with you. lt's valuable only when women wear it. l can give only this for it. Young maiden has appeared before you like a lightning... My heart is on fire with your sight, what am l to say about it? l heard your name day before yesterday.... Met you yesterday... l gave myself to you today, trusting you, mother promise... Our hearts have met casually and become a great pair... When you look into my eyes, bashfulness takes over me... l'm trembling like you've kissed my cheeks... O my man! l can't hold away myself from you... Brother-in-law is here. What a surprize! Remembered your wife atlast. My daughter returned home sick and weak in year after marriage. Are you coming from home? l left home long back, l went in search of a job. Your slippers say that loudly. Son-in-law's position hasn't change a bit. Please come in. Mother! Mother! Mother! No medicine for fever, not even gruel to eat, nothing to cover also... Sister-in-law! - Coming. Elder sister-in-law! - Coming... What's it? - Give me Rs.10. You're asking as if you gave me. Not for household expenses, mother is down with fever, l want to buy a shawl, please give. l don't have money. - Uncle, here's money. Uncle...you brat! Have money? Why are you beating him, sister-in-law? Everyone here know where's the money. Will you give it on your own or shall l take it myself? How dare you threaten me? Stay in your limits. That's my brother's money, he too has the responsibility to look after mother. ls he the only son? She has three more sons. Take care of her or conduct obsequies! You sold off jewels given to younger sister-in-law, if you've any shame or sense, will you save stealthily what's common to all the family, what will you do with it after everyone's gone? will you take it with you? Ramu, mind your words. l'm telling you the truth, l would've done this long back if mother and sister-in-law hadn't stopped me, you were stashing away every penny here, and younger sister-in-law sold off all her jewels for the family. Great chaste lady! - Sister-in-law! She's a bad omen, the day she came here, we hit bad time. Sister-in-law, mind your words. Bad mouth, l'll take it, l'll not take a word against her. Will you behead me? - Sister-in-law! Not just one, l'll abuse her 100 times. She's a bad lady that's why her husband left her.- Sister-in-law! How dare you raise hand on your sister-in-law! l wish you weren't my son. - Mother!- Mother? lf you were to qualify to call me like that, fall at her feet and seek her forgiveness. Sister-in-law, forgive me. Words and deeds are quite different. They will threaten you. You live alone here. Who will bother if anyone kills you? You're right! There's only one way to stop such incidents happening again, nothing...if entrances to home are different, you're safe. Let your brother-in-law come. - lt's not good to wait till then. lf you put a thatch wall, the troubles will come down. Okay. But... Do it fast. - Stop it. You brat! What are you watching?

You've to keep your folks, no use in accusing others for it. That's your biggest mistake. Yes, it's my mistake to expect sympathy from a prostitute.

No need, l'll come on bicycle. Bring the bag. Tiredness because of carelessness, nothing to worry. come with me to get medicines. That's why they say a woman must have husband or son to take care. He was here so brought a doctor. Husband! To hell with him. He's a burden to me and my daughter. Brothers situation is very bad here... He has changed completely. Live with tears all life... Our fate...it's our fate. Your son, Ramaiah. Have you finished writing? l'll post it. Sir...madam! - Come here. Post it. - Okay madam. Old lady got a letter. l'll give it to her.

How is the watch? O village boy, dressed up handsomely like a city man... Will you pay back as Guru wishes or slip on the way? O city girl! You've taught me everything city needs... Would l keep Guru's word or slip on the way? When l see you in suit... When you walk majestically... Don't know who will lose her heart to you? Don't know how many pairs of eyes will get bewildered? Let any number of eyes get bewildered or sky may fall on head... Only you know my heart very well.... Will you bring the monkey sitting on hill? Will you teach it to play new games? Will you keep your word or return home as loser? l'll bring the monkey from hill top... l'll place it before your feet... l'll teach it a fitting lesson... l'll keep my Guru's word...

How am l to repay the gratitude? Sir! l mistook him, he's a thorough gentleman. That's why l told you not to rush. Let's go now. l want to say something... l want to say about an angel on earth amongst men... You changed a innocent village man into a smart and confident man... Changing him into a complete man... Granting boons without seeking... Filling dark life with light... An angel who turned mud into a diamond... Why is the angel so merciful on me? How am l to repay her gratitude? lf you give little place to the angel in your kind heart... She'll forget her world and make your heart her permanent abode... Uncle...uncle... Uncle...he's chanting only his name. That's where the problem is. l've got it, sister. Come here... Though mother is here, he's chanting uncle's name, l'm sure it's witchcraft. - Yes. May God bless you. That cheat uncle went to mosque also. l'm sure he would've charmed you with some black magic. Please save my son's life. People should be afraid of you, why are you getting scared? There's a remedy for every poison, it needs a herbal concoction and a poison remedy decoction, if l mix both and give him a dose, it'll give him relief.

Acting like chaste woman but behave like cheap woman. l was wondering, why we are facing all this? lt's because of you. Mother-in-law! Unable to see this cheap woman, her husband left her for good. Mother-in-law! l thought you were my daughter, are you also leaving me alone? Have l become a burden to you also? - Mother-in-law! What great sins have l committed? Mother-in-law! They said l'm useless to my husband, l ruined your family's honour, l think it's better to end this life of insults. You were abused because you came to my house, because you married my son, right? After all these insults, no need of this house or this village, come...come... Let's see what he has for mother and wife. Come dear...come. Who are you? - Don't you've eyes? Look here.

Arranging programs, tickets, and music... l don't have time, you take care of it. Work must go on, that's all l want. May l song or dance? This is fun time for me. Let's go out. As you wish. Let's fly in the air... l visited London, Japan, Paris and all other places... Dated with many world beauties... But still, you're the best... l gave my heart to you only... l thought looking at your suit, boot, hat and height... l'm giving myself to one of a kind in this world... l say yes to you... l'll send you into sky in a rocket... l'll spread bed and wait for you...

That's what remains, adjust with it. l didn't come for royal feast, anything you serve is great. Get me some water. Betel leaves for son-in-law. - Coming. Hasn't your husband bought any jewels? How can he make one who is taking refuge in ln-laws' place? To hell with him. Well said, may you be blessed with long life. How can l avoid after getting him married to my daughter? Why are you still sitting? Go to sleep. Troubling me again. Am l troubling you? ls it what l get back for what l did? What did you do? Jewels or money? ls it love only if l get jewels? Bloody love. Though poor in money, l'm not poor in love. lt's true l couldn't give you anything, l left my family and home for you, l'm working as farm hand for you, just for your sake only. - For my sake only? l brought this hair oil you love so much. This is my first gift to you. You begged and brought it. Mother...mother... What's this thatch wall? - Come in l'll tell you. Where's mother and others? - They have left. Why are you still here then? Why should l go with them? Look at our son first, he hasn't opened eyes yet. Not even saying anything now. Don't know what to do - Do something, as eldest daughter-in-law, you raised a wall between us, chased out mother-in-law, drove out your sisters, do something with him also. What did l say? Did l say anything when you stole money from pockets? Could l stop you from saving it stealthily? l was silent to keep family honour. Now also l'm silent because l'm helpless. Son! Look at the ill fate that struck our home. What did you say? l said come and wash the utensils. Reduce my burden and work and eat good food. How dare you shout at her? How dare you ask your sister-in-law to work? Not just wash utensils, l'll ask her to sweep house also. How dare! l'll break your teeth and throw you out. lt's not that easy. lf you throw me out, l'm not shameless like your daughter to live in parents home. How arrogant! She's abusing your sister, why are you watching fun? lf you talk, l'll break your teeth. Can't advice sister who has left her husband? But ready to shout at me for telling the truth. l'm dying with these troublesome women. Younger son, please ask her. l've been watching everything, isn't all this done by you, mother? Will you feed like a dog to a son-in-law? Will you look down upon him as a farm hand? Will you make his wife work for your another son-in-law? Who is getting insulted in all this? lsn't it you? lsn't it our home? lsn't it for your daughter? Don't you atleast have some sense, sister? You too joined them in insulting him. He brought doctor to save your life, he brought you expensive hair oil though he went without slippers, did you ever try to understand his love? You thought parent's home is heaven, he tolerated all insults because he loves you so much. Don't know where he went? May have committed suicide also? Brother. Sister, you don't know the value of husband when he was here, when he goes, your life will plunge into darkness, Brother... For everyone... - Brother... You've made me realise my mistake, l'll not stay here for a moment. Go, though realised late, you'll live happily hereafter. You saved our family's honour. Atleast hereafter sister will lead a happy life. Forgive me mother-in-law. To hell with me! Was it all a drama enacted by you? lf not how can l advice my mother. You're right, l though elderliness means power, l didn't expect so much trouble. You made me realise my mistake, and saved your sister's life. That's enough for me. You got trapped, O bird... l'll not leave you at any cost... O colourful fan... O colourful merry-go-round... Neither you nor your father can dare tackle me... You trapped many with your beauty... Ruined the lives of many married men... But atlast fell into the hands of master cheat... l'm no ordinary man... l'm not a weak man... l'm scion of Gadusu family, a real man and a hero... Not only your father, even your grandfather can't tackle me... Are you angry? l'm not scared... Passionate? lt can never dare touch me... l've seen world beauties... l'm smarter than you... l've come to expose your double standards... You? Are you worried of the expose? You're a cheat, you've cheated me. You said you trusted me and love me, you promised on mother and showed me heaven in your hands. l may have said that, but if you expect that again you're mistaken. lt's a mistake to fall into a trap by a cheap woman like you. lt was my mistake to forget myself in the love for you. Stop there. What was said earlier and now is your mistake. Am l your wife to boss over me? lf you've any respect leave my home immediately. l'll go but only after avenging for ruining my life. l'll go after killing you. You? Yes, it's me. - Have you become a lord? l'll become anything. - How dare! You dared and deviated from path. l'm your brother so l'll follow you. How arrogant! When you can get so arrogant for paltry Rs.500 salary... Don't push me. l'm not that innocent Ramu to follow your orders blindly. l'm Lord Ram Prasad. Sir. Don't rush sir. You're an educated men, from a good family, he came to teach you lesson for troubling mother and wife. He taught you. He's not a man to covet women. Look! Come. What's the price for your love drama? - Price? For singing and dancing with me on my instructions. For sending out the doctor. Why are you acting innocence? l'm innocent, trust me. lf you know it's curtains down. That's why l'm asking you openly. No fee for love. - Love? You used an expression so cheaply. What do you know about love? You know to cheat in the name of love. You know to trap men. You ruined a man whom we hoped will bring prosperity to home, how many men you've ruined and their families? l knew everything about you, so l didn't fall into your trap and saved my brother. Your brother? Have you understood? Go away. lf you had sense to know good and bad, would you commit so many sins? Wasn't it all for money? For bloody money? Take it! Take it! Take it! Take it! ls it enough? Will you accept now that l'm a Lord's daughter? Dr. Mukunda Rao's house? Go further up, turn right, a small bungalow next to a big one. Thirsty...thirsty... Mother-in-law! Please give me a glass. Madam, little water please... Mother-in-law! Mother! Mother-in-law! - Sister-in-law! Take care of mother. Mother-in-law! Mother-in-law! Daddy, Ramu has done as he promised us. l saw your brave act and heard it too. Who are they? My mother and sister-in-law. - Sister-in-law? Doctor brother's wife. Just now l gave him a good piece of mind. That's why l told you not to rush. You don't rush, we haven't yet lost the cause, let's all go to him. Sir. - Take all our cars.- Okay. Lord! You ruined us! Bloody lady! You ruined the family. You devil! How daringly you've cheated! Have you taken the money Ramu sent from Madras? Let me see if your sin money can bring back a dying soul. Lord... Die...die... Mother-in-law! Mother-in-law! Mother-in-law! Nobody is here, all have left the place. Now only l remain here to go. Don't cry, you're not the only one to ruin this family, everybody contributed their might, it's not in our hands to unite this family, it's all in God's grace. l think you came walking, please have something. Lord! lf l'm that lucky, only after my husband and mother-in-law forgive me. Chose my car to kill yourself, l'll shoot you. My brother! Brother... Son...son.... Son Chandram... Son Chandram... Mother! - Son! Mother! Son... My second brother. - Pick him up also. Tell me if you've any more, let's pick them also. Brother! lt's all over. Our relationships depend on our previous birth's deeds, all have left us, only l couldn't go. Brother, l'm a sinner. We all are sinners and committed mistakes. No use in repenting now. Hubby...Mukundam! You've come at right time. My son is unconscious, come. Why are you so scared? Why are you latching the door? Check my pulse. Why is your body so hot? - By looking at you.- ls it? l too have strange feelings on seeing you. You're a great charmer! Spell a cast or spell bound me? Neither l cast a spell nor spell bound you. lt's romance. lf l decide l'll get it. That's why old woman and her daughter-in-law left home. What can they do? How can she dare refuse me? l gave her Rs.20 because she's from a rich family. She refused me. She got ruined. Did you see him? Bloody! No use, only pungent smell can bring him back. Don't kill me. - Did you see that? Bloody... Let's punish him. Let's take him to the house he ruined. Bring him. Come. Brother, they are here, our folks have come back. Mother-in-law! Mother-in-law! Get up. Poor lady. Mother! - Son! l've brought your wife. Oh my son Kittu! Son... Mother-in-law! lt's me! - Uncle! Uncle! Uncle! l got back my son. Ramu, you saved my son's life, you made me realise my mistake. l was mad after money, never behaved responsibly. Sinful money can take only lives, it can never save lives. l mad to think unity is not strength and parting ways is good. With steel walls in my heart l put up a thatched wall in the home. l've brought the sinner. He's the one who started everything. He advised her to put that wall. He's a cheat.
