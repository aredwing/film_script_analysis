What a pleasure it is to see you ! What a show! We hadn't seen her since San Francisco . lt was beautiful . She is sublime . There's Nadia . What the hell is she doing? No wait, something's wrong ! See you ! Okay, bye ! Oh , excuse me ! You didn't see a thing , little shit. Police . Scram ! Don't move ! Watch out! Quick, let's go ! Shit! Miss, your carton please ! Your carton . What about my carton? Come on . . . ls it okay? Can l get dressed now? l'm sorry. WHO STOLE THE DlVA'S DRESS? ls it the Opera? No , it's my butt. Don't worry, l don't work there . Do you like jazz? Obviously! Or l'd be stealing some mambo . Too bad l only like disco music. . . the classics don't do it for me . l'm not a classic, l'm a lyric. That's an overture . Hurry up, because l'm about to close . Don't worry. Do you mind if we talk? Yes l do , why? - Was that you in the pictures? - No , it was a crocodile ! What's your trick? Here , look. . . Not too dumb. Of course , it's only a cottage industry. And for the collections, you arrange an air lift? - l have something else . - What is it? Well , you ! So , you steal a lot? - lt's not for me , it's to give away. - To whom? You're really not the curious type , are you? lt's to give to a guy, who's in his cool period . Who is he? A mongrel , a rasta . . . Hey, don't walk so fast! A guy who dreams of stopping the waves! Deep inside , you're a lyric! Anyhow, one of them invited me for dinner tonight. She split this morning . . . l n the middle of the street, but we got her! We had no choice ! Anyway, she'll be quiet now. Yes. lt's under way, yes, no tracks. l don't like cars. Tell me Mortier, did you identify this girl? Yes. Nadia Kalonsky. . . . . . a former prostitute who disappeared a few months ago . The funny thing is, we had something on her. Do you have a file? The investigation on the international drug trade and prostitution ring . Ah , yes. Your famous Antillean network. - Chief l nspector, l know you doubt. . . - l don't doubt anything , Mortier. You've never produced a single valid witness! They're always dead . Paula , why were you at the railroad station . . . . . . at the time of the murder? Were you taking the train? lt wasn't a coincidence . He called me , we had an appointment. He wanted me to meet her. - Who is this guy? - He's one of my informers. He's a bum . You'd better agree . He's on parole . . . . . . and the judge found him a job at a carnival lottery in Barbes. lt's really great for his social rehabilitation ! This Nadia Thinginsky. . . . . . according to your statement. . . . . .was supposedly killed because she was about to talk? She hinted that she knew who the leader of the Antillean network was. So , she knew the Antillais? No , that's the point. The Antillais wouldn't be the real boss. - She had some revelations to make . - What revelations? She couldn't tell me much . She was hiding when she called . Why? Was she being watched? All l know is that she woke me up last night. She seemed hounded . She asked me to pick her up at the station to protect her. To protect her, you ! We used to be together, a long time ago . So , why did you contact us, the police? - What? - Why did you call the police?! Because it's too big for me . Nadia is something from the past. lt's the past. l know nothing . l called you right away. Why did you prevent me from intervening? l didn't prevent anything ! l wanted to see . . . l didn't know. Well , we saw. . . but we don't know anything . What was the gentleman accused of? l ndecent exposure on the street. To a minor. Check it out. . . As usual . You have nice witnesses. Pathetic. . . Not so ! You're pathetic! l know your cop tricks. You've heard the cassette , but you want me to talk as well . l know nothing . l got you the cassette , l'll say nothing else ! The cassette? You found a cassette? Krantz, you never told me about this. l had nothing to tell you . l told you l was going to make you meet Nadia . There's Nadia . No wait, something's wrong . She told me she recorded everything . . . . . . and that there was enough to sink the guy. Don't move ! From the cafe where we sat, we couldn't see . We were too far. The cassette is in the postman's satchel . We must find it. And three . That's it? They said they would increase my pension . . . . . . because they're widening the street. Those are stories, grandma . Widening arteries have never caused an increase in pension . Good-bye . So , am l a coloratura or a lyric? - Tell me , what am l? - Rather dramatic. Dramatic? You had said lyric! No , dramatic is just as well . lt's even better. The decor is rather gloomy. You think so? Here , we're into disaster. . . luxurious disaster. And this one? What is it? The lady has taste . lt's a Rolls Royce . . . . . . Corniche ! lt happened in Monaco , at the casino , against a palm tree . Yes. . . We are not much indeed ! You wouldn't think a Rolls Royce could have an accident. He had one like that when he picked me up hitch-hiking . l didn't hesitate , l climbed right in . Well , if my lady would like to follow me now. Not bad , your loft! - You like it? - Yes! The previous owner was great. - Do you want something to drink? - Sure . Super! lt may not be cold , but it makes bubbles. l can't drink from the can , do you have a straw? A straw? - You know, a bent straw? - Bent straw? Bent, very chic! lt looks like Raquel ! Actually, l'm not surprised . . . . . .the former landlord had a car crash , with these paintings! Son of a gun ! Not bad , Saint Jules. Here , that's all l have . Bent. That's what you call bent? Well , yes, bent. That's the most bent thing l have . - What's wrong? - lt stinks of gasoline . lt's a radiator hose . Then , of course , it's normal . ls this your magra? Nagra . . . N . . . ! How does it work? What are you doing? No , don't touch . This is sacred ! No , you can't touch this. You're really picky. l'm not going to eat your Nagra ! Well , this is Swiss and it's very precise . Tanagra . You sure look Swiss. lt's her? ls it her, Cynthia Hawkins? She's so beautiful ! Do you think so? Yes, very beautiful . Are you in love , Jules? Of course not. l'm not in love . - Yes, you're in love . - No , l'm not. Here , wait, you'll see . Listen to her. Put this on . Wait. What are you doing with my watch? But. . . my Skelton ! Don't cry, baby. l have a much better one for you . Just great for a little toad like you . lt's a Rolex! Yeah , my first steal . Do you have any idea what this is worth? Yes. Thank you , Jules. lt's The Wally by Catalani . lt takes place in the mountains. A woman . . . she wants to die . She is broken-hearted and she sings. She says, ''l want to go away, far away. . . . . .where the clouds are golden , where the snow is white . . . . . .you may never see me again , ever again .'' lt's tragic. And at the end , she throws herself down an avalanche corridor. Such pathos! Super! Listen , it's about to begin . The orphans, the unemployed , the refugees, the unhappy in love . . . Luck is a fickle mistress. Beware ! Not on the ace of spades, it's bad luck. Grab her mane . . . a gift for the winner. . . . . . my regards to the loser. Try your luck while the wheel is turning ! Yes, madam , it turns. . . You see ! A win for the young lady. You see , l told you . Come on , let's go . lt's Beethoven . We already have him on the mantle . Come on , l said ! l don't like Beethoven . How cool ! She has such a voice ! Can you lend it to me? - Yes, but you must give it back. - l swear. Do you know what time it is? You do this to me again and l drop you off on the road . With your Vietcong ! Look, don't yell at me ! l had a terrible trip. Wait. Don't move . The Wally, Act one . . . Cynthia Hawkins. How did you get it? She never recorded anything . Who stole the diva 's dress? Good evening . lt's a nice job to be a postman . Well , it all depends. You get to bring the love letters. Yes, and also the tickets. l don't care , l don't have a car. Everyone in my family works for the post office . My brother in law, Mark, a tall guy. You know him? Maybe . You know, there's a lot of us. Do you like this light? lf you knew how much it cost! And l got it wholesale . lt creates a nice ambiance . Well , that's not all there is. l don't know you , but you're cute . You'll have to come see me again . lt's hot. Aren't you a little nuts? Yes, l am . Nothing was stolen? Your equipment? l don't think so . You should have seen the slaughter! l couldn't stay there . Jules, are you thick or what? Why? l'm telling you , it's the cops. lt's obvious. lf not, why did the two guys this afternoon . . . . . . come and take the addresses of all the postmen with mopeds? These guys are nuts. But why? Anyway, l don't get it. l'm bushed . Congrats to the postmen , they're really solid . What do you expect, it's not the Aeropostale . They broke all his things. He's cracking up. - lt's banging in my ribs. - What is? His helmet! l'm not used to sleeping with a guy in a helmet. lt could save him , in case of an earthquake . Go ahead and laugh , the guy on TV said it the other day. What's that mattress brand that lets you sleep without bugging the other? Look, l promise , they came about five minutes ago . They are fascists, believe me . And they looked really vicious. All right, call me back, okay? What do they want? These two guys, what do they want? You , old buddy. They came back. Two inspectors. You must have done something wrong again . Ayatollah , come here and eat. Come on . You don't want to? Fine . Can you lend me some dough? Yeah . And can you lend me your Malagutti? l can't keep my moped . Did you hear me? Okay for the dough , but not the Malagutti , shit! - l'm still breaking it in . - Breaking it in? You don't know what it means to break it in? - Fine , break it in . - Yes, l will . lt's just a little cube , filled with horsepower. lt's quite a machine . lt requires a special touch , so easy! lt's not a postman's slug . lt's a racer! Listen to the music, you drive it by ear! Speaking of which , why don't you turn it down? Don't worry! l'll sway to the music. Be careful . Good-bye , Mermoz. And thanks for the money. - What are you doing? - l forgot my gloves. Okay, so long ! Oh ! The gas. . . A little tall , but not bad . . . she's pretty. Look at this! lt could use some cleaning . lt looks neglected . Excuse me , but the cleaning has already been taken care of. An awl in Nadia's back, an awl in Krantz's back. He's looking for the same thing we are . - But he's a day ahead . - Maybe he's a day awl . Very funny. Except that we don't know who he'll kill next. Anyway, this place is uncommon . Who are you? - Flowers, Madam . - Put them down . . . . . . over there . - Did Nicole give you something? - No . . . - . . . l have something to give to you . - To give to me? l recognize you . The moped . You're the postman? l apologize . Do you take me for the Beatles? l'm no disco singer. l had it pressed for you ! Do you know what we do with people like you? Do you have any idea? l'm going to call the hotel detective and have you thrown out. That's all you deserve ! Please ! Please ! l could have pressed charges. You are lucky. But. . . you . . . Do you steal the dresses of all singers? So , l'm the lucky one ! l have a fan? l heard you in Bordeaux. And last year. . . . . . l went to Munich specially for the concert. You made the trip for me? Yes, on the moped . On the moped . l'm late for my press conference . Will you excuse me , please? From Paris to Munich on a moped? - You're pulling my leg . - No . You even sang some Wagner. The Wesendonc Lieder. You wore a blue dress with pearls. A little girl threw a bouquet of red roses. There were 1 8 curtain calls, and you refused to sing . You refused . Nobody stole my dress that night. Don't you like blue . . . . . . Mr. Postman , stealer of dresses? lt sounds like a melody from Satie . What's your name , Mr. Postman? Jules. Jules is old for a young man . l thought the French were modern . My father was old-fashioned . l'm kidding . Jules fits you so poorly that it fits you well . Madam , it's no secret that you've always refused to record . The quality of recordings today is close to perfection . - What don't you like about them? - l sing because l love to sing . Alone , l can't. l need the public. The concert is an exceptional moment. . . . . .for the artist, for the listener. lt's a unique moment. So , you're against the commerce of art. No , commerce should adapt to art. . . . . . and not art adapt to commerce . What does Mr. Weinstadt, your impresario , think of it? Ask him yourself. What do you think of secret recordings? lt's a theft, a rape . l despise them . People say that you are a diva . Do you feel that you are one . . . . . . and if so , do you have whims? You know, that little postman has a date with her later. But she has a party, and there's no guarantee that she'll come . - She's a diva . - A diva ! Then again , she may come . l'll change records. Help me . l'll play the other side . lt has to be at the right temperature . The bagette . The knife . . . . . . not too thin . . . . . . but not too thick. The inside . . . . . .fresh . . . . . . not too much . lt's an artform . We , the French , are envied throughout the world for this. Look. You spread . Some people get high on aircraft glue , or soap. . . complicated things. . . This is my satori . Zen in the art of toast! Look! You can look. There's no more knife , bread , butter. . . only a repeated gesture . . . . . . a movement. . . . . . space . . . . . . emptiness. Thank you . - You do know that it's expensive . - Caviar? No , not the caviar. The caviar is a gift from Elba . No , your recording ! One , there aren't any in the stores. . . . . . and two , the concert the other night was the best. So? l do this because l dig it. For the pleasure . The pleasure . The pleasure . . . But there is no innocent pleasure . . . Well , that's what l say. You should see the tapes at Jules' . Tell him how many you have . Tell him ! How many l had. How many you had? Somebody destroyed everything . What? Last night after you left, l went out for a ride . . . . . .when l came back, everything was destroyed . That's crazy! Was anything stolen? No , the equipment wasn't touched . All the tapes were pulled out. l think it was the cops. You're paranoid . The cops! - How do you know it's the cops? - l don't know. When l was in Saint-Lazare yesterday. . . . . .the cops arrested a girl right in front of me . One almost hit me . But something looked bizarre , it didn't fit. Danger! The cops. . . l saw the guy's card . This isn't the post office . . . You saw the card . Something happened in Saint-Lazare yesterday. But they didn't arrest the girl . She was bumped off. l don't like parking lots. We're closing shop. Did you clean up? Everything is blocked . . . . . .the relays are closed , nothing leaves. The last girls were sent tonight. We warned those who are working . But we're stuck with a kilo of heroine . - Dump it down your sink. - lt's going to cost a bundle . You're risking your head ! We leave nothing and nobody behind . We have the postman's file . . . . . .the photos, the neighborhood investigation , the vehicle plates. My brigade marches forward . l'm holding the reins, but. . . . . .they march alone . So we have to move fast. . . and be very tidy. We searched his studio . There's no need to go there now. Two inspectors are watching it. l don't believe he'll come back. But there's only one thing . Someone is looking for him . . . . . . and this l can't control . We have to find him . He's too dangerous. Nadia's been eliminated . lt's only a cassette . Shut your face ! Your face , Antillais, is what the postman saw! l want this cassette at all cost. As soon as possible . . . . . . before my cops, before anyone else . Don't forget that if l go down , you go down with me . Fast. . . . . . and tidy. Tell me , my poor man . . . . . . don't you think l'm starting to look like an old woman? No . . . like a Spanish woman . . . . . . an old Spanish woman . You know, l have to go . Diva . Your tape , are you taking it back or not? l prefer that you keep it if you don't mind . As you wish . So , you want to leave? Here , Alien . Don't get pulled over by the cops! N'Doula . . . Jules. Hi . She's the queen of Africa . She's the queen of the night. l went to the great jewelers. l bought everything . Almost! Look. . . How about that. Go ahead , no , no , it's for you , go ahead . Thank you , Jules. - Thank you . Good-bye , N'Doula . - So long you two ! lt's a magic bird . We would like to talk to you about Cynthia Hawkins' recording . l'm listening . We believe there exists a recording . . . . . . of an excellent quality, of Ms. Hawkins' last concert. You think so? This recording , how should l say it. . . is of interest to us. . . . . .to own exclusively, of course . Don't you think it's a little early to talk business? We'll call you back. The patience of the buffalo is great. . . . . . but so is his strength ! Abyssus abyssum invocat! What is abyssus abyssum? lt means the abyss calls the abyss. Yes, l assure you , it would be wonderful . She is beautiful , proud , sensuous. She's a woman ! Jules, the jam . Do you think that l could have all of these qualities? Well , yes. At least, it's the part. Don't apologize . You were talking about the Tosca , not me . lf you did not exist, Jules. . . . . . one should not invent you . Why not? Because you know music too well . l mean , the opera . But l like music. l know. We both like it. And now, speaking of music, l must work. You want me to leave? lt's funny, but l think l'll enjoy your presence while l'm working . Could l take a bath? Excuse me? While you're singing . Go ahead . Go ahead . Nobody has ever heard me rehearse . l won't tell anyone . Hello? Yes, he's here . Jules, it's for you . Nobody knows l'm here . Who is this? We stopped by your place last night. - l suggest you ask Mrs. Hawkins. . . - l don't understand . - . . .what she thinks of record pirates. - lt's a mistake . We want the tape and we will get it. Jules, do you like it hot? Are you all right? Bad news? No . . . scalding . Mr. Weinstadt, please . ls something wrong , Jules? l'm fine . No news, but two inspectors. . . . . . are watching his place 'round the clock. This Nadia . . . she's a whore . A whore who wants freedom . . . who wants to take off. She invents a story so that we cover her. . . . . . but she gets caught. So they want to set an example . . . . . . and they stab her. As for your Antillais, he's a common pimp who leaned too hard . What about Krantz? An awl for him too , same weapon . Same reason ! Set as an example for the rest. l don't believe in this international prostitution ring . The crime empire ! Always the folklore , with this Antillais. . . . . . covering for a mysterious and high-placed individual . ls it amusing , Mortier? The kid is on the run . - lt's normal for his age . - His place was searched . A theft, that's all it was. Did you see the equipment we found? Someone took advantage of his absence . He'll resurface , you'll find him . With an awl in his back. However, according to the last information you may be right. We found the moped where he spent the night before last. You see . . . Of course the satchels were empty, there was no cassette . He left with his friend's motorcycle , a delivery guy. Excuse me , my dear, but l have some bad news. l would like to speak to you . Please . . . Very well , as you wish . l was just contacted by some men from Taiwan who claim . . . . . .to have a recording of your last recital . lf l didn't have reason to believe that this tape exists. . . - . . . l wouldn't tell you about it. - lt's not the first time . Yes, but this time the recording is perfect. . . . . . made from the third row center with professional equipment. Secondly, Taiwan has never signed international agreements. . . . . . regarding copyright and reproduction rights. So , what do they want? They have us by the throat. Either you sign with them for an official and exclusive record or. . . Or what? They pirate it, without your consent. They use the recording to print a record in their country. They flood the market. . . . . .with no guarantees on the quality and no profits for us. lt's blackmail ! Let them do their record ! l will never sign ! Listen to me . l understand your scruples perfectly well . l have accepted them until now. l have let you lead your career as you wished . . . . . . according to your fantasy. Purity is beautiful , refusing to make concessions. . . Journalists like it. Great! But some bastard made a recording . lt exists, you can't deny it. lt's not a question of pride . So , you either continue to follow your diva's whims. . . . . . or you act as a responsible artist and you make this record ! We can reverse the situation to your advantage . Excuse me , but you're 32 years old . . . . . .you can't appear more than twice a month , and it's exhausting . You've had a warning . Remember Munich? A voice is not eternal , except on record . lt's time you think about it. The Taiwan record . . . . . .would be an unbearable stain on your career, Cynthia . And don't think they'll stop at that! lt will create a precedent. You'll be alone . Think about it. l have until tomorrow to give your answer. Simon , please . l thought you were a friend . Cynthia , please don't mix up the genres! You are entitled to your contradictions. . . . . . but live with them by yourself. They will never force me . Especially not this way. l'll be back. Where are you going? l'm going to pick up something . l have a gift for jogging . lt's in the chromosomes. Go ahead , l have steel thighs. Go ahead , feel them . - Don't start with this again . - What? Are you afraid? l'm not afraid , you exhaust me . Fine , don't touch . l came in seventh at the police force games in '78! lf you don't train , you lose your shape , but. . . With you , l'm not about to lose it. Look! The motorcycle ! Son of a bitch ! Now he's stuck! The arcades! Don't shoot him ! VETERAN CARD That's not it, it's the only solution . l can't sleep at my home or anyone else's. - No , you don't even have any money - Money is not a problem . - l'll pay you back. - Forget it. Come on . Be cool . lt's only for the night. Thank you . My name is Nadia Kalonsky. I was the mistress of Jean Saporta. I tried to kill myself yesterday. He stopped me. The bastard told me no one can die without his permission. I want to die. I hate him. He will make me disappear. Jean Saporta is Chief Inspector of the criminal division. Nobody knows that for the past eight years... ...he's been leading a prostitution ring between Africa and Europe. He exchanges the girls for drugs. I have been locked in a house for three months. Stop it! You want to end up like Nadia?! Another one . The Antillais' network supplies mostly the Parisian region. Almost all the black girls of Foch Avenue work for him. The same goes for those of the Bois. The Antillais' network supplies mostly the Parisian region. Almost all the black girls of Foch Avenue work for him. The same goes... We'll get him in the parking lot. Go sober up somewhere else ! You're doing it on purpose ! You schmuck! There are some stupid bastards! He was a pain in the butt, l swear! Thank you ! lt's the two guys from Saint-Lazare ! Because of the cassette ! Where are you? Don't move . They're gonna kill me ! Alba , come . Hurry up, l'm going to faint! Hold on , Alba wants to say something . Hello , super Jules, are you cracking up? What's that? l told you not to leave . Okay, l'll tell you a story. Let's say we're going to the beach in a convertible . We're wearing long scarves. We're driving very fast because there's no speed limit. At the beach , there are wood cabins. . . . . .with doors of all colors. There are pine trees and rocks as round as buttocks. . . . . . and the sea disappears. Far away, you'd see a white boat, with sails. . . . . . but it would be a mirage . You can hear the bell on the boat. . . . . . calling the people for dinner and the beach would empty out. So you see , Jules. . . . . .we'd take out our bathing suits, but we wouldn't put them on . We would go naked and the beach would be deserted . The sea would return , even more blue . We will be nude . You will take my hand and we will go swimming . We will be scared because there's a big blue wave . . . Alba , prepare the bag . Go down the back way and wait for us at the street corner. The tip? Bad manners. My name is Nadia Kalonsky. I was the mistress of Jean Saporta. Jean Saporta is the Chief Inspector of the criminal division. Nobody knows that for the past eight years... ...he's been leading a prostitution ring between Africa and Europe. The Paris ring is led by the Antillais. He's a bastard. We don't know his real name. Alba , you drive . l'll take care of Jules. Give me the kit. My recording? My recording? You tried to cheat me? There's more to do than to cheat you . Look, my poor man . Here is your tape . - Come on , drive , Alba . - Where to? To the magic castle . Shall we listen to the rest? When l was little , l was told there were witches in the fire . Not only when one is little . We have to do something for Jules. I'll run away. Your men will catch up with me. I know you gave them orders to kill me, but you will be executed. This time, I choose the time and the place. I'll let myself be killed, but there will be witnesses, proof. You will be executed. Where are we? l n a castle . What is this castle? The castle of the witch who makes poisoned red apples. . . . . .for the commercial for the toothpaste of the stars. - Does it belong to Gorodish? - l don't know. Does it matter? lt exists. l won't offer you any, it's frowned upon . Where is my tape? Come and see the ocean . l'm not asking for much , l want to talk to the Antillais. He will understand . Geez, you sure collect troubles. Do you have a cassette for sale? Yes, but to your boss. lt's dangerous. For you . l don't like your mug . The client is king . Did you find our down payment Mr. Gorodish? l saw that you had stopped by. What is your answer? Unbelievable ! Where's this guy from? Nobody knows him . He's not kidding . l'll get him , and faster than he thinks. Right now, the main thing is to recover the cassette . Then . . . Then , erase the postman . He's too dangerous. - He listened to it, for sure . - We don't know where he's hiding . . . . . . and his buddy with the delivery bike didn't know a thing , believe me . We'll find him . l'm starting to get a feel for where he might reappear. When l have him , l'll deliver him to you . You'll take him to his place . l will have cleaned up and you'll plant this on him . The police is looking for one like this. But with my version . They have to find something . The affair has made too much noise . We'll throw them a bone . . . . . . and they'll find this. l don't like this. Inspector Saporta, good morning! The keys are on the dashboard. You can start the car. You're on board an 1 1 CV Citroen. A bit of history... This was the car of both the police and the gangsters. I thought it would suit you perfectly. I hope you appreciate the gesture. You're now driving at cruising speed. Our friend the Antillais has given you my instructions. Enjoy your drive! There, we've arrived. You will get out of the car. A final detail. Leave the keys on the dashboard. Thank you. Come in , l nspector. Yes, a mess. Move forward . To your right. . . Your right, l nspector, yes. Go up the stairs. To your left. Move forward . Watch out, l nspector, a hole . Step into the light. . . . . . l nspector. You are magnificent in the light, l nspector. Straight ahead , l nspector, straight ahead . Good . . . A few more steps. There . No , no , l nspector, don't be afraid , just a few friends. Move towards the table . Straight ahead , faster, l nspector. Jean, when you will have heard all this, I'll be far away. You will have killed me. What I just told may not be sufficient to make you die. I'll run away. Your men will catch up with me. I know you gave them orders to kill me... ...but you will be executed. This time, I choose the time and the place. I'll let myself be killed, but there will be witnesses, proof. You will be executed. You can't reach me anymore. l nspector! Since our rapport is based on mutual trust. . . . . . l would be grateful if you could take care of one small formality. Start by emptying your pockets. Put your jacket on the hanger, you'll be more comfortable . Take the tool in the red box, it's a metal detector. l will not offend you by explaining its purpose or how it works. Don't forget the shoes. An accident could happen so quickly. All you've left to do , is put the briefcase by the pillar. To the left of the staircase . Open it. Splendid . You can go back to your place . Thank you . Won't you listen to the rest, l nspector? For that price couldn't l get the case? A deposition must be signed , even a magnetic one . There's the signature . You fool . . . l already took care of the cassette . You didn't think l'd pay that price for a cassette alone . ''You'll find everything on the cassette'' . The slut! With that, l was going down . She got herself killed just to get me . This was the signature . That will teach me to be sentimental . You know, l nspector, l don't care about family stories. Don't move ! The recording ! You shouldn't have gone with the competition , we warned you ! Come on , let's go ! Gentlemen , l was waiting for you . l was about to leave . Don't complain , you've already been paid ! l'm not complaining . l'm not. So , you're happy? Where are you? No , he's gone . Yes, to give his tape back to his diva . Where? The damn fool ! He'll be shot! Here we are . 25 Francs. Don't move ! You don't move ! Get lost! Get lost! Don't move . Drive . Do you really want to leave after the concert? Leave the flowers. Hello , Saporta . We're coming . Answer it! Wait! Yes. What, right now? Okay, l'm coming . - l have to make a report. - What? There's nothing to report. Saporta wants me to summarize the major points, right away. - Tell me how it ends. - Lovely. So l stay here alone . What, lovely? l'm leaving you the grub. So long , sweet-cheeks. l'm taking the car. Macho man ! But l don't know a thing ! Nothing ! - Shit! - Shut up! - A garage is a beautiful thing . - l don't like elevators. You don't like anything . Slowly, kid , we've arrived . Come on . Come on , we move fast now. Come on , come on . Wait, wait! Come on . Priest. . . . . .you should always send down the elevator. All is well , right. . . all is well . There , calmly. . . Pick it up. Pick it up. You gave us a good run , it's yours. Come on , pick it up. Put it in the player. You see . . . . . .we're not mad at you . Everything is in order. Order. . . . . .that's all that counts. The order! But l don't know anything ! Neither do we ! Go ahead , jump. Come on , kid , jump! Does the chain bother you? The chain bothers him . Help him , Priest. We were jumping better when we were his age . Don't move ! l'm going to faint. Take care of the kid . Give me that. Sit him down over there . Congratulations on the clean up. My name is Nadia Kalonsky. I am the mistress of the Antillais. He wants to kill me. lt's not the Antillais. The Antillais leads a prostitution ring. He exchanges girls for drugs. The cassette . . . Saporta , it's Saporta . That is correct. Thank you , Paula . Good job. A miracle . . . To think some women don't have fun in the force . lt's the only recording . lt was you . lt's yours. lt's my gift to you . Forgive me . Listen . . .
