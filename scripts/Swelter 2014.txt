The heat has claimed at least one life in Nevada, and the cumulative effect of daily triple-digit highs are being felt in other ways, even grounding some commercial flights. It's simply too hot to fly. Again today, heat warnings and advisories are posted in parts of eight states as temperatures soar to the 110s, even toward the 120s. And the desert southwest at 119. Phoenix experienced its fourth hottest day in history. The west is used to sizzling summer temperatures, but this week has been brutal. We've just learned that Las Vegas is once again expected to have its hottest day in 10 years. Two hikers had to be rescued after getting stuck in the sweltering conditions. Death Valley baking at 128 degrees, just shy of the world record set a century ago. We are approaching the prison chapel. Roger that. Hey, who the fuck is this? - It's Joey Bishop. - I wanna be Sammy. - Oh, for fuck's sake. Take it. - Oh, come on guys. Hey chief, this better be the only face you remember. - Open the cage, Carl. - John? - John, what are you... - Carl, you didn't get the text? - What the fuck is going on? - I don't think he got the text. He must have AT&T. Come on. Be a good little boy and sit in the corner. Okay. 30 seconds. Just take the 100s. Time. Let's move. You're never gonna get out of here with that money. We'll be out of here before you, chief. Gentlemen, welcome to the Top of the World. Who are you guys supposed to be? We're the bad guys. Hey! It's the Back Street Boys! It's the Rat Pack. - Who's that? - That's Joey Bishop. You don't even look anything like Joey Bishop. Well, you don't look like Marilyn Monroe. - What the fuck? - I'm not. I'm Jayne Mansfield. Asshole. Hey, did you see that fucking sign? Nobody's supposed to be on the roof. Where's Pike? Don't even think about it. Fuck it, man. Don't even get dental. We've been hit. Seal all exits. - Copy. - Wait for backup. I'm on my way. - Just do it. - Don't... God is the main line Tell him what you want Jesus is on the main line Tell him what you want Jesus is on the main line Tell him what you want You got to call him up and tell him what you want Call him up and tell him what you want Hallelujah! Shall we pray? Thank you, our Heavenly Father, for we have sinned. And though the wages of sin be death, salvation is at hand. Though the flesh be evil, the soul can be redeemed. Cleansed by the blood of Our Lord Jesus Christ and Savior. Let us not be punished for our past sins, oh Lord, but judged for what lies within our hearts. Let us not be destroyed by the fire and brimstone. If but 20 righteous are found, I pray thee Lord, spare us for the sake of the 20. Yea, if but 10 among us are found to be righteous, I beg thee, Lord, do not destroy us for the 10. For redemption is at hand. In the name of the Father... the Son... and the Holy Ghost. Amen. Yo, yo, Cole. You see that shit in there? That was some grassy knoll shit, motherfucker. Did you see his head? Bam, dude! Ha-ha! Do that... Chapel transport, check in. Hey Charlie, how's the sermon today? You repent your sins? - Hi sweetheart, how are you? - Okay. I'm good. Listen, a little concerned about the bingo game. - Yeah. - What is Bishop doing that for? I'm not... I'm not sure. I haven't talked to him. - Hey. - Hey. - Ladies. Babe. - I told you, 7:30. I know. I... What? Had to break up an illegal stickball game? Oh, and they wanted me to tell you... that if you're planning to shut down Tuesday bingo night, they're going down in a blaze of glory. That bingo night is an illegal game. Don't you think this town needs a little break? Illegal gambling, prostitution, that's the kind of town you wanna live in? The town I wanna live in isn't even in this state. And where's London? She didn't come with you? So I talked to Billy over at the Gold Strike. I'd just be bar-backing at first. But he said they're always looking for dealers. Yeah, maybe Billy can get me a job cleaning toilets. They're always needing maids. Well, I was thinking I'd work double shifts while... you go to nursing school. I just wanna get out of this town. What, you think I wanna stay here? Football was gonna be my way out. Now even the army won't take me. London. London! Thinkin' all night Workin' all day This is my life So have it your way Thinkin' all night Workin' all day This is my life So have it your way Ms. Talbot has another yeast infection. The woman's like a brewery down there. - Any other appointments? - No. Give me a second to set up. You got an emergency, Doc? Yes. I'm replacing a liver. Mine. You know, there's a well-thought out process here. You make an appointment, you take your turn with everybody else. - Headaches getting worse? - I think I need something stronger. Oh, if you want something stronger, go see Big T in the Denny's parking lot. Take a seat. Really? Is that necessary? Well how about you pretend to be a patient and I'll pretend to be a doctor? Look at the bunny. - Any more hallucinations? - No. Nothing that makes sense. Nothing? - Find a soul in there yet? - Not yet. Mindy! Heard him sneak in the back, like always. Thank you, nurse. Your film came back from the lab last week. Last week? Mm-hmm. It confirms my earlier diagnosis. You're fucked. See this area here? This part of the brain right here? Yeah. I don't know what it controls, but I'm pretty sure it's important. You know, a car accident, a blow to the head, a sneeze, even, all it takes is for one of these bullet fragments to move... even half a millimeter... and you may forget how to piss. Hasn't moved in 10 years. Neither have my bowels, but one day, God willing. He's a Chester, named Mouth, fresh out of the joint. Likes little girls. Used to brag about the Vegas job, like he was there. And more than that, he said the guy that got away took one in the head. Cole's chasin' a fuckin' dead man. It's gotta be a 110 degrees out here. It's not even noon. Yeah, but it's a dry heat. Oh, shit! For... God damn it! I'm gonna fuck you up, man. Hey Mouth. Not worth it. - Goin' out for donuts! - And this just in. Authorities report a prison break at Nevada State has left seven guards dead... believed to be work of the gang known as the Rat Pack... who robbed a Vegas casino... Who the fuck shut off my fuckin' radio, goddamn it! - Where's Jim? - Went for donuts. Is there something I can help you with? What do you know about the casino robbery, about 10 years ago? Just what I read in the papers. Why you asking me? I got 10 million reasons. Well, I don't know shit about it. That's not what I hear. What I hear is, you can't keep your fuckin' mouth shut about shit you know nothing about. It's just bullshit, man, to pass the time at the joint. That's all, man. That's all I know. Nothing else. That's it. Fuck, man. Ah! All right. All right. Couple years ago, okay, I was working at the Palomino. There was a stripper named Jada, Jade or Jasmine... It was Jasmine, yeah, Jasmine. Okay. She saw the one that got away. Ten years ago, her ex, a doctor, the doctor said he got hit by a truck, but she said she never seen a truck use a 9 millimeter before. Hey, that'll come in handy if you ever run into a circus clown. Yeah, look at Stillman. It's like he's waiting on a train that's already left the station. I'm thinking you're out where the trains don't run. Fuck! We're all fucking crazy to be out in this desert. He couldn't remember nothin'! His name, how he got there. Yeah. Yeah, he was lucky he even survived, you know? He lived? Yeah. She hung out for a couple more years, hoping her ex-loser husband could get his hands on some of that cash. But he never did. It never showed up. And in Baker, $10 million is not gonna go unnoticed. - Baker? - Yeah, Baker. A shithole, 90 miles outside of Vegas. Is he still there? Come on. Is the man with no name still there? I don't know. I really don't know. But the doctor, you can find him at the Dry Mouth Saloon. - Where the fuck are we goin'? - Baker. Oh, God. Hey Doc. - Got this thing in my shoulder. - Yeah, I'm all booked up. Oh, all right, wait inside. Thanks, Doc. Hey Sheriff, next time, use the front door. It's not an abortion clinic. Bet your father sometimes wishes it was, huh? I seen it. He had an arrow sticking right out of his back. You shut up, you crazy old man. - Hey, Ronny. - Hey, how ya doin'? Good day. We got an Indian problem, Ronny. Hey. Ronny, you thinking about... thinking about getting that Lucky Sevens license back? Election's not for another month, Madsen. Come on, man, Bishop's through in this town. You know that. Everybody knows that. - Who the fuck elected that guy? - Sheriff? You did, Madsen. And you. And you. And you, Henry. We just thought he'd get rid of Cody and his bunch... not shut down legitimate businesses. I didn't vote for no one. Yeah, I didn't vote for nobody either. You shut up. That brother ain't even from here, man. Watch it, Madsen. The usual, Ronny? Yeah. Usual. And make it to go. One hot. - One iced. - Thank you. You just think about what I said, Ronny. Baker's dried up since he got here. Wait, they said those were going up next week. They're all over town, Ronny. You got something to confess, Sheriff? It's Sunday. We're closed. How did you know it was me? I was married to a Latin woman myself, once. Drive a man to confess to shit he didn't even do. We started an hour early today with this damn heat. Carmen must've forgotten to mention it. I maybe forgot to listen. So Joshua. You've been here, what, eight, nine years? Eight years, four months, seven days and three hours. But who's counting, right? So you remember what Baker was like. Before. Did you know I was on TV? No. Reverend Stone's Traveling Salvation Show. I had over a million followers. Million and one. One too many, it turns out. Before Baker, I was reduced to turning one-night stands into lifetimes of misery. Viva Las Vegas Wedding Chapel. We had a drive-thru. Nobody's in this town by accident, Sheriff. You closed down casinos, bars, hell, you even tried to close down the Dry Mouth. How you expect these people to make a living? Baker's like a delicate ecosystem. We don't have to like it, but we're all in it together. Sheriff. When you drive out the wolves, the rats take over. Word gets out about rats, attracts more wolves. Throws everything out of balance. Unless, of course, there's one wolf that's big and bad enough to keep all the other wolves at bay. Really think they'd be this far south? No, we just drew the short straw. We don't expect 'em this far off the highway. Mm-hmm. Well, have a good day. What d'ya think? I don't like it. Step out of the vehicle. Officer down. Officer down. I repeat, officer down. Pine Creek Road. We need an ambulance. Suspects headed north in a 2009 silver Dodge Charger. I repeat, northbound on 95. Bill, is that you? Hang on Bill, we got units on the way. Pike. Pike! Come on. Come on. Stay with me. That's it, come on. Come on. I got you. His name's not Bishop. What the... Do you know about this? Everyone else her age is either dating a cheerleader or on his way to Afghanistan. He's a good kid. And you know how many calls I get about this "good kid". She's almost eighteen, Gabriel. Waiting up, Sheriff? Your mother was worried sick. You know, seeing as it's after midnight. - Is it? - What could you possibly be doing? In this town? There's only one thing to do. The Tastee Freez is shut. I can't have you talking to me like that. You're not my father. You're just the guy that's fucking my mom. She didn't mean that. Didn't she? No. She's afraid, Gabriel. She's afraid that this is all there is. That this desert is the edge of the world. There's two kinds of people in this town. The dead and the dying. I wonder which are we. Devil's on his way. It's just something my father used to say when it was this hot in June. What were you, Sheriff? I mean, before? I've seen you walk into situations most men would run from. You don't even carry a gun. I notice you come up here every morning and every evening, sit on the bluff. I can see the whole of Baker from up here. Yeah, the thing is, you're never looking towards town. You came in what, second in that quick draw competition in Vegas last year? First. First. Okay. Rocks and bottles and paper targets, they don't shoot back, huh? You're wondering if you got what it takes to do my job. Well you don't. Nobody does. But you see, the job don't care. So you just gotta do it anyway. Man, I shouldn't have to tell you. You're a war hero, Ronny. I'm not a hero. I was just trying to punch my ticket out of here like everyone else. You know, it's funny. You're the only person who doesn't wanna get out of this town. Think they hate you for that. Thanks for the coffee. - Here you go, sir. - Yeah. Thank you. Want the pie, Sheriff? It's cobbler today. Is it? Mm-hmm. Cobbler would be very nice, Halle. Can't believe anybody's gonna still vote for this guy. There ya go, Sheriff. Why don't you carry a gun? A sheriff oughta carry a gun. I'm afraid I might shoot somebody, Henry. Gentlemen. The Apaches say, "Where there is lightning with no thunder..." "there is bad medicine, because lightning is of the past," "that the Thunderbird has already flown away." "That is why we did not hear it." Yeah? What do the Navajo say, Keith? Pretty much the same thing. This stone, I found it out in the desert. Was struck by lightning. It is bad luck. They say, "When a man hides his past, he has no future." We go in at dark. Bury the stone, you bury your past and bad luck. It's apple. Will you two just get a room? I have a room. In fact, I have a whole house. I just let you stay in it. What's with the dress? I'm meeting Stacey to play pool. I don't want you hanging out at the Dry Mouth. Where else are we supposed to play pool? Nowhere. That's the point. Peaches, you on the clock? You know Doc, they didn't give the worm a choice. Since your wife left, I swear, you'd crawl right in here with it. So, what're we talking about? Worms. Oh come on, Johnny. You used to have to buy me dinner and get me drunk first. When did I ever have to buy you dinner? How 'bout it, Preacher? Are you feeling moved by the spirit? I believe I do. Look at Peaches and the Reverend. He never goes with any of the other girls. Hannah calls it insider trading. How else do you think she got this place? Where were you? Had to walk. If your car wasn't so loud you'da come and picked me up. The guns stay in the car. What the fuck, man. So this is hell. So these four guys walk into a bar. - Something wet. - Wet we've got. Beer. - So where you boys headed? - Maybe we're here. Honey, Baker is smack in the middle of Las Vegas' large intestine. Everybody's just passing through. What the fuck you lookin' at? Nothin'. I was just wondering what you guys do for fun around here. Johnny, let's play pool. Johnny, come on. Yeah, you go play pool, Johnny. You're not even here for five minutes, you almost get your ass kicked. That hillbilly? What's he gonna do? I wasn't talkin' about him. My daddy said, "The only thing sadder than a half-empty glass of whiskey..." "Is when both halves are empty." Yeah. Hannah. Doc, maybe you should run an I.V. so I don't have to run down here every two and a half minutes. Another 40 CC's, stat. Mind if I join you? I'm more of a straight-up drunk than a social drinker. Wow. It'll be like a triple-shot tonight. Oh, you're gettin' a bonus. Oh, yes you are. Cody. Mezcal. Send over eight depth charges. God damn. How did these people lose the west? Cody didn't lose it. I hear there's one for every man he's killed. Bullshit. Or one for every woman. If there's any trouble, Sheriff Bishop can handle that bunch. Bishop. Yeah. What kind of western town would we be without a sheriff? Sheriff? Oh come on, that's horseshit. Look at this fuckin' place. - What's horseshit? - Hannah said the sheriff's name is Bishop. Pike wouldn't be that stupid. Pike wouldn't be. What about the good doctor? He says the guy wakes up one day, doesn't remember anything, and then later he just disappears. Amnesia? Bullshit. Pike's not gonna forget ten million dollars. Little conspicuous, don't ya think? Yeah. I wanna get a good look at this sheriff. I'm getting too old for this shit. I'll take care of it. - Hey, Tonto. - Careful. Oh well, how tough can he be? He needs Geronimo and Pocahontas to protect him? I think they're protecting you. Shit. Yeah, this is the sheriff. What? Okay, I'm on my way. And listen, Hannah, you leave the shotgun under the... I'm sorry. Damn. Johnny! - What the fuck? - Pussy. Whoa, whoa, whoa! That's a bit too much, don't ya think? A man should be able to hold his whiskey. Harriet, tell Ronny to get over to the Dry Mouth. Will do, Sheriff. Now, please. God damn Ronny, Sheriff needs you over at the Dry Mouth. Sounds like they're tearing it up. - Turn on your radio. - Ronny! Mezcal, man, I did not mean that... Oh! Oh! I don't ever wanna see you in my town again. You understand? Home. Now. Not you. Sheriff. Get him outta here. Alright, yeah. Come on. Come on. Let's go. In the end we will remember not the words of our enemies, but the silence of our friends. I'm sorry, Sheriff. I mean, I didn't even hear the call. We figured it out. It's an anal thermometer. Then why is he still here? If you had that money, would you be? - What you gonna do, burn the whole town? - Why not? All you gotta do is blow on it and this fuckin' town'll go off like a Roman candle. Come on, guys. It's the four of us against the whole town. What the fuck happened to you, Stillman? What, you get a little whiff of pussy and you're ready for retirement? It's a bunch of fucking hillbillies. Cole. Control your brother before I do something he will regret. You put your jacket back on, or you leave your fuckin' guns in the car. After all these years, I never thought we'd find him out here. You know, prison is a funny thing. On the inside, it's like an eternity. Then they give you back an old suit... 30 bucks, a bus ticket, to go back to life. And it feels like it was just yesterday, but... it wasn't yesterday. Fuckin' ten years ago. We lost ten years. I envy him if he doesn't remember. I'm gonna need you to take out those cell towers and the phone lines. I want that sheriff and his deputy out of town for a few hours. How the fuck are we supposed to do that? Get creative. Hey, Stillman. Cole's only my half brother. What? Cole is only my half brother. That means he can control me only half the time. Any casualties? Peaches broke a nail. I will take a brawl over a cowboy convention any day. You know, I'm thinking about sprucing up the place anyway. Really? The Dry Mouth hasn't been spruced up since 1912. Okay. I get it now. Hello. I like your hair. You look pretty good yourself, cowboy. Is that for a, uh, special occasion? I'll let you know tomorrow morning. Do you believe in second chances? Yeah. And third, and fourths. Even a glass that's half empty's half full. And it might just be the best half. Good mornin'. This is Hank Greely with the Valley Sales Yard. The market was three to four dollars lower... Should I wait? Nah. I got a ride. Just take care of the other tower. And you know, people always say it's not the heat, it's the humidity. Well let me tell ya something. It is the heat. It's not stopping. No thanks. Mighty fine coffee. I know how good the coffee is. It's my town. Is it? So, you boys are just uh, takin' in the sights? Enjoying our weather? We did take in the thermometer this morning. It is big. Tell me something, Sheriff. Why would you wanna be reminded on such a grand scale of just how fuckin' hot it is here? It's just there to sell gas. See this? Apparently there's only two like this one in the world. Fella I won it off told me that made it lucky. Wasn't lucky for him. What do you think it is makes one man lucky and another man... not so much? I think about it. Think about it a lot. But then I've had a lot of time to think. Well, I think... a man does the best he can with the cards he's been dealt. Well... what do you think, Sheriff? Heads or tails? I think it's a coin spinning on a table. And I think a man's gonna do what he's gonna do. Sheriff, I just got a call from Old Man Johnson. Somebody shot one of his cows. Says he wants you to handle it personally. Sheriff, should I meet you out there? Sheriff? I can't help but notice you don't wear a gun, Sheriff. Grand Canyon. I hear it's nice this time of year. Nice talkin' to ya, Sheriff. A fan in this heat, it's a bit like a joker on a jack. Don't ya think? Like tears in a river. You haven't changed. You have. London, get in the car. But it's hot in the car. Just get in the car. She's beautiful. And tough. Like her mother. You think, after all these years, you can show up here and I'll fall back into your arms? Not this time. Who's that guy, Mom? He's nobody. Your keys are on the table. I don't know why in the hell you're trying to raise cows out here, Henry. Hell, this one probably just committed suicide. I wanna know what you and Barney Fife are gonna do about this, Sheriff. - A cowboy boot? - Yeah. Cowboy boot? So? Well, none of the kids wear cowboy boots these days, Henry. Somebody's out there shooting cows and God knows what else. I heard shots out in the flats, too. What in the hell would somebody be shooting at out there? Henry, you usually get good cell reception out here? - How the hell would I know? - Sheriff, We have a 1033 in Doc's office. - Ronny? - Probably just another false alarm. I want you to head into town and find out where our guests are. And if you run into any trouble, you call for backup. You understand me? Get that goddamn light out of my face! Goddamn it, Doc. You're lucky I don't carry a gun. What, are you trying to burn the place down? Uh, the smoke set off the alarm. I should've destroyed that years ago. I meant to. I tried hypnosis, meds, associative suggestion. Hell, I even thought about calling in a, a shaman. You know, $10 million, it's a lot of money. Pike. Pike! Go, go, go! Come on! Stay with me, Pike. That's it. Come on. Pike! Go, now, Cole! Leave him. Hands on the hood! I oughta shoot you for impersonating Frank, asshole. Ah, it was Friday night. I was drunk. Fuck you. Help. Help me. I mean, what were the odds? You stumbled out of the dark in front of the only man for a hundred miles who could do anything for you. Help. "No hospital" you kept saying. "No hospital. No hospital." Help me please, in here! - What's going on? - Cut away his clothes. It's all right. Who is he? Bishop. Even when you said it, it sounded like a question. Carmen picked Gabriel, you know, like the angel? Carmen knows? There's no medical reason for your memory loss. You just didn't want to remember. I guess what you found here was worth more to you than ten million dollars. I still don't remember where the money is. Well then, you probably never will. I promised I'd take her away from here. Away from this town. The money would've given us a second chance. Doc! Doc, here, up, come on. I'm afraid your friend Boyd knows his way around the human anatomy almost as well as I do. Boyd? The bullet severed my superior mesenteric artery. I don't know what that means but I know it's pretty bad. Come on. Come on. It's not bad. Oh, you're the doctor now? You're just slowing it down. I'd really rather get it over with. I didn't tell him anything. It doesn't matter. I didn't tell him anything. Doc! It doesn't matter. Doc? Doc, no! I told you, I'll always come back for you. Where is Stillman? He's on a date. Really? With the light? Man. Where the fuck are you goin'? Well, everybody else seems to have a girlfriend. I think I'm gonna go find one. And um... you have a little... A little what? A little thing. Fuck, man. I thought I was supposed to be the crazy one. When I left, I had no choice. None. No. It's your DNA. It was always one more job, one more score. Nothing is ever enough with you! Shit. Come on. Where're the dang keys? There are only two like this one in the whole world. Keep it for good luck. Goddamn it. Come on, London. Let's go. It's getting late. So you're a fortuneteller. I was palm reader back in Vegas, before I became a tainted woman. You're holding it too tight. She's holding it just fine. It ain't a dick. Come on, Stacey. You can break. So this is who you are? This is you? Matching coffee mugs and salt and pepper shakers, this is you? That's what I always was. When you found me I was lost. I'm not lost anymore. He doesn't know where the money is. So you know about the money. So you know about him. Does he know about you? He came here without a past. So I didn't tell him mine. Well isn't that convenient? I came to Baker to raise my daughter. To keep her away from people like you. I could've killed you. Johnny! Johnny. Bishop, what're you do... Where is she? Where is she! We got in a fight. She's at the Dry Mouth. What's wrong? Where is she? Stacey! What room? What room? In 103. I'll find her. I promise you. What is wrong with you people? They'll kill you. They cannot do anything to me. I've done it to myself a long time ago. Save me the best half. Doc! Doc! What's a girl like you doing in a town like this? What kind of girl is that? Well, you're obviously not from here. You ever been to Bloomingdale, Kansas? No. Can't say that I have. Well, I have. How far does that go up? No! God damn it. Ronny, I need you to stay where you are. See, I know these men, and they are... they're bad men. Ronny? Oh, come on, just... No. Oh, shit. It's okay, Ronny. He was just playin'. Ronny, stop. He'll kill you. Ronny, here, here, take it. Halle, come on! - Stop it! No! No! - Come on. Halle, please. No! No... Hey, Ronny. Hey. Ronny. Ronny. Son? Look, I'm here. Come on, Ronny. Look at me. He was headed up toward the church. Never thought of you as a religious man, Pike. Get up, Boyd. You remembered my name. Welcome back. You sure you're up for this? It's been a long time. He killed Ronny and Doc. And they had nothing to do with this. Boyd? Stay out of it, Cole. The doc was a drunken fool. And the deputy? Oh hell, I did you a favor. He was after your job. I gotta ask you, Pike. How do you stand this fuckin' heat? Um, Cole. You're running out of friends. As long as you got enemies, I got friends. London. London. Baby. London. Hey. You here for sloppy seconds? You piece of shit! Fuckin' hillbilly. Blow to the head. All it takes is one of these bullet fragments to move even half a millimeter and you may forget how to piss. Stop it! London? London honey, come here. Asshole. I'm gonna fucking kill you! How 'bout a threesome? So you rape little girls now, huh? Honey, come... Didn't see that one coming, did you old man? Do you know what we do to people in the joint like you? As a matter of fact... I do. Help me. Who's ringing that bell? What're you doin' to this man? - Gracious me. - Jesus Christ. Come on! Come on! Walk, or I drag ya. - Not you, little girl. - Gabriel? Gabriel. Honey. - Oh, you knew. - Gabriel. You knew. All these years and you knew who I was. Yes. You're Gabriel Bishop. Am I? Yes. What's he doing here, Cole? You're late, little brother. Always good to have a Plan B. Isn't that right, Pike? - Pike? - Who? - Hey. What's this all about? - Bishop killed Boyd. - What? - I never seen anything like it. Pike! You're a fuckin' dead man. Where's Stillman? Where's Stillman? Who are these men, Bishop? His name's not Bishop. It's Pike. He used to be like my brother. Until he betrayed me. Just like he's betrayed all of you. Seems he's not the man you thought he is. Maybe never was. Now, somewhere in your shitty little town, your sheriff, here, has hidden $10 million. I'm gonna need you to find that for us. Jesus Fuckin' Christ man, and we elected you sheriff? Take 'em to the diner. Come on, Cole. This is between you and me. Anyone leaves town, anyone goes for help... I see one unfamiliar face, first I burn the diner, then I burn down your town. You have until sunrise. Whose town is it now? Hey. Where's that money, Bishop? Whatever the fuck your name is. You really think I would risk my family if I knew? I have no idea what a man like you would do. Fuck this. Wait, it's in... it's in the church! We was just pouring the foundation just when Bishop got here. - That's right. - Yeah, he's right. - I helped pour that foundation. - Wait. Wait. Wait. - We can't be sure. - Where else could it be? - Burn it. - Yeah! Burn it! Oh yeah, the cement foundation will protect the cash. You can't seriously be thinking about burning down God's house. Oh, you know God's never even been in Baker, Reverend. Hell, he just passes by on the way to Vegas like everybody else. You're supposed to protect us, Sheriff. What're you gonna do? I don't know. I'm just a guy, a guy who's trying to do the right thing. But it's a hell of a lot easier to do the wrong thing. I'm getting the fuck outta this town! Y'all be smart to do the same. - You heard what they said. - Yeah? They'll kill 'em. Nobody's going anywhere, Madsen. Johnny? Johnny, calm down. Give me the gun, kid. Why didn't you leave? Because he wouldn't leave. You ever wonder why? I love you. In my way, I love you. I always have. This is not just about you and me. Do you think these men are gonna leave without that money? Do it for the girl. It's not too late. Come with me. I'll let him live. Tell him to bring that money before dawn. Stupid kid. What you doing here? So, he just sent you to me. To do what? Help me remember? They've got my baby, Gabriel. I thought if you knew where the money was, you'd leave. So that's it, then? So what'ya gonna do, kill us all? No. But I promise you, I will kill you. Hmm. Don't fucking touch her! I spent three days in this fucking town. In this heat. Well, at least it wasn't a total waste of time. Kane, let her go. Let her go. Now. - Let her go! - Fuck that! Fuck you! But, I'm-I'm your brother. Half-brother. Just the two of us, now. It always was. You think you deserve a second chance? No. All of this was for what? Money could be anywhere. Could be buried in the desert. Could've just blown away. Always was long odds. Thought about you. Breakin' rocks up at Nevada State, I thought about you a lot. New Zealand, I thought. South of France, lyin' on a beach. But here? With her. So this is about Carmen. You know we don't have to do this anymore. I think we do. Hey. This is gonna bring people here. They'll find out who I am. I gotta go. Go. Then, go. Go. Stay here. It's okay. That ol' silver mine. Out at my place, been threatening to cave in for years and years. I think it's time I sealed it up for good. It's okay, it's okay. This is Baker. Whatever happens here, ain't nobody else's business. What're you gonna do now, Joshua? Head back to Vegas? No. This is where I belong. Pontius Pilate washed his hands clean. I don't think this comes off. The Lord said, "If but ten among you be righteous, I will not destroy the town for their sake." You think God found ten righteous people here in Baker? I think sometimes He takes what he can get. Just like being on the water Reaching out to the shore Walking hand in hand with my baby The world spinnin' round Oh, so many miles and days spent there That walk by the harbor Oh, someday we'll get back To the water Where we first took that walk alone Someday we'll get back To the water to make ourselves a home I wanna talk with you, baby To the good times and the bad times If I could slow down These hands that wind Just like that summer night When I asked you to take a walk It might last forever Oh, someday we'll get back To the water Where we first took that walk alone Someday we'll get back to the water And make ourselves a home That was so long ago by the harbor Well, I asked you to take a walk that might last forever That day by the harbor Hear me cry Someday we'll get back to the water Where we first took that walk alone Someday we'll get back to the water And make ourselves a home Oh, so long ago That day by the harbor Oh, someday we'll get back To the water Make ourselves a home
