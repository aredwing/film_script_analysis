You into her too ? - Listen, last night... l'm at the bachelor party, l'm doin' karaoke and then l wake up in the barn. That's all l remember what happened, l swear. Oh, Crawl ! You are such a hypocrite ! God, you waltz in here telling everyone to be honest with each other, and the least you could do is be honest with me. l'm being honest. [ Sighs ] That you blacked out and woke up with Tracy ? My God, you must think l'm stupid. l am stupid. l never should have brought you here in the first place. Why did you bring me here, Becca ? Because it was Thanksgiving and you were alone. You knew Travis was gonna propose to you, huh ? - Oh, please. l felt sorry for you. - ''Please'' to you. Spare me. You needed someone to shield you from Travis... - because you couldn't even deal with it yourself. - That is not true. Have you told anybody the truth ? Talk about hypocrites. Hey, l don't even want to be your friend. Fine. Here's your ring. Fits better on my finger anyways. See ? [ Door Opens, Closes ] What are you doin' here ? l don't know. What happened last night ? You tell me. Well, l woke up in the barn, but l, l can't remember anything. Yeah, well, l'll tell you what happened. You and Crawl were all over each other when you left the bar last night. Why don't you take it from there. l was only gonna dance for him. After what we had together ? Man, l thought l knew you. You are so low. - [ Walter ] Honey, you okay ? - Fine. - Where are you going ? - Out. [ Rooster Crowing ] Becca, what happened ? [ Sighs ] Everything. Wait up ! Wait ! - So l take it there's not going to be a wedding ? - You got that right. lt's too bad. Believe it or not, l was looking forward to having you as a brother-in-law. So where are you heading ? Back to California... where it's normal. Okay. Well, if you find a baby-fresh nug out there, send her my way. [ Clicking ] You got it. Take care, all right ?

[ Travis ] lt's really great, you all inviting me. - Oh, that's a beautiful bird, Mrs. Warner. - Thank you, Travis. - You always were a great cook. - Hmm. Before l sit down, l'd like to say that it's really great... having everybody together for the holidays. Matter of fact, l'd like to make a toast. To Rebecca, the sweetest girl l know. l know we've been through a lot the last couple of days, but l still love you as much as ever, and l think you still love me. - So Rebecca Warner, - [ Sighs ] - will you marry me ? - l, uh-- - Don't even think about it, Becca. - Oh, man. Listen, you guys, l'm sorry for interrupting your meal, but there's something that everybody needs to know before l go. Can't you take a hint, you idiot ? Look, Mr. Warner, if you don't mind, l'd like to take this guy outta here. [ Crawl ] Walter, you gotta hear this one, man. Well, uh, uh, okay, Crawl. You go ahead. - Go ahead, Tracy. - Tra-- Hi. Look, Rebecca, l woke up in the barn with Crawl this morning... and l thought l did something really stupid. - Mmm. - How can you come in here and insult this family... - after what you did ? - Look, l don't remember what l did, and l think l know why. - Oh. - l found these in my car. Now, you said you saw me drive off with Crawl last night, but when l got in my car this morning, the seat was so far back... l couldn't even reach the pedals. Somebody awfully big must have been driving, huh, Hoss ? [ Spitting Sound ] Theo, you know anything about this ? You want to pass those mashed potatoes there, hon ? No, no, no, no, now just to hell with those mashed potatoes. Now, you better speak up. Your job depends on it. - Theo ? - Theo ? Aw, hell, Walter, it was just a joke. - Oh... - We took those two out there and we put 'em in the barn. l didn't think everybody was gonna get so upset about it. - So l didn't bone her. - So he didn't bone me. So you guys didn't bone. Oh, now, wait a minute. You can't really believe-- No, you wait a minute. l gotta tell you, Travis, it really tweaks my melon to see a buff bro like Crawl here... get weized on by a greasy scumbag like you. So you just chill. No, Travis. You just get out. - Hey, you can't talk to me like that. - No, but l can. [ Grunting, Groaning ] Majored in karate for two semesters. [ Laughs ] [ Walter ] l gotta say something here. Theo, now, l appreciate your honesty, but you're fired. - What ? - That a boy, Junior ! Now, just take your ass on outta here and take him with you. You take him. l don't work here anymore. He's gonna need a lot of food stamps. [ Sighs ] l'll do it. Ah, you are so low. [ Groans ] [ Connie ] Tracy. Would you like to join us for dinner ? - Are, are you sure ? - Oh, definitely. Great. Come on, sit down here, Tracy. We'd be real proud to have you join us for Thanksgiving. Now, how about... having my future, um, uh, well, son-in-law carve up this bird for us ? Oh, uh, wait. There's, um, there's something that l need to tell you guys. See, Crawl and l were never actually, really-- Sure about the wedding date. So we're gonna put things on hold for just a little bit and we'll see how things develop. Hey, l can respect that. Oh, yeah, that's a hell of an idea. Hell of an idea. No use rushing into these things. - All right, all right, all right. Enough of that. - Yeah. Now, let's chow down here... - and munch on some grindage ! - [ Laughing, Cheering ] - [ Crowing ] - [ Crawl ] Shut up ! - We got the point ! - [ Squawks ] - Everybody say, ''Cheesy.'' - Cheesy !
