She's the rookie that's making LEE Hyo-li retire, you asshole! Where's Mila? Where the hell is she? Tell me where she is, you asshole! I was close to getting it back. But I failed for health reasons. Then I fell in love. She was a ray of light in the depth of my despair. Let's get hitched. I'll give you five grand now and five more if we pass the immigrations. I don't know what you've heard but that's nonsense. Oh, yeah? You got married five times because you fell in love with all of them? If it's the money... We were crazy about each other. Real or fake, I'll never marry a punk like you. We even broke up once... Damn it! ... like other ordinary couples do. The one who loves more gets hurt more. Help me. I'm dead if I go back to Korea. They'll kill me if I go there! Please help me. By the power vested in me, in the sin city of Las Vegas, Nevada! I now pronounce you man and wife. Marriage was a beginning of our life. Stick in your tongue, I'll kill you. You too, Ms. Lee! Use the tongue, please! Deeper, deeper! We talked about a lot of things coming back. Hey, lady! What are you doing with your life? About our future. Don't ever run into me when we're done. Everything seemed perfect. Why the hell is she in such a hurry? PAPA I should've never met her. Even if I did, I wish that I loved her Just the right amount. Agent Park. What is he saying? He's saying uh... That he didn't... ...want to love her... I know you're suspicious. Even I never believed in love like this. I'll never be able to love again. It's as if I've seen the sun and now I have become blind and disabled. Disabled in love. Having seen the sun, He has a disability in love. Is he translating me right? Thank you ma'am. And what is this disability in love? Sir, I think it might be an Asian expression for... ...impotent. - Oh. We got an Asian male who marries a woman ten years older than he is as soon as they meet which just happens to be a few days before his visa is to expire. Right. He doesn't have a particular place of residence either. Exactly! I need you to get a deportation date on him as quickly as possible. And he just might try to run away so... contact the local police so they can help to keep an eye on him. - Yes, sir. - Papa! Papa! I missed you, papa! I'm off the hook! What a great turn out! This is the way it should be! Children need a guardian! This is cool! The three of us! What a great singer! You happy? I'm happy! Everybody's happy! We're here? Up the stairs to the bathroom! I gotta pee! - Dude, it's not Rosie. - Who is it? Oh, my. - Oh my gosh. - We are dead. Even today we'd faced her scoldin' and there's no reason! Didnt even put that Rosie to cryin' Or even any broken window! All the cause of this! The fool visiting this hell on Halloween Day! You don't know MIC! The fool coming without knowing any hip to the hop! You're an ugly gift! Sent from the down and under! An ugly gift looking strange to the shady! We'll keep our eyes on you, ugly! I got it! You go that way! Good morning, ugly! You're looking nice as usual! Not! This... This colorful multinational troop of kids is your mother's? Except for you. They're all her ex-husbands', and now I have to raise them to get my visa. Be patient. Be patient. Let's make this easy. We just gotta pretend to be a family when we need to. I'll just leave quietly when my business is done. There's nothing to this. You just obey me. Just think of me as god. Kick Me! Then I'll keep the family peace. First of all, I never wake up before 11 am. So what should you do? Just keep shut till then. Shut up! You pay for living expenses and rent. You pay 70, we pay 30. Give me your resume by tomorrow. I'll get you a job. What? Immigrations will be asking about you. Don't forget I can always charge you for child abuse or sexual abuse. If anything happens to us I'll kill you. You know you're my mom's sixth husband? I'm an adult next year. Don't you fool with me. - I never... - Any questions? - I... - Share Gordon's room. Hey! Hey! Jimmy, Tommy! I told you to stop! Take it off! You got scissors for a tongue? How dare you cut me off? I'm trying to speak, here. You don't know nothing! You'd be in orphanage without me. How dare you threaten me? You'd be deported with a phone call. You're not minding your manners, young lady! Is it so hard to respect your elders? Oh, yeah! This is America! Your name's June? Yo! June, like the month? It's nice and simple. Catchy name, like a geisha! Why do I have to work for you guys? Look after Rosie till you get a job. Who's Rosie? This one? The squeaky one? Want me to babysit? Don't you have any Korean soup? I'm totally craving it. I don't think you know me very well. So let me give you a warning. There's a lot behind this friendly looking face. Hey! You glaring at me? You wanna see what I really am? You'd regret being born and meeting someone as nasty as me. Mind your manners! Say good morning! You'll see what hell's like. You know what hell's like? You can't go there alive. I'll send you... there... what the hell? The hot taste of hell... what the hell? Yes! See! I told you! I told you food from your world could be used as lethal weapon, loser! - Kiss my ass! - Whatever! Ha! Don't say that. - Stop it! - No! Stop! I'll kill you god damn pricks! - Hi. - Hello. Who are you? Well, I'm Miss Phoebe. Who are you? What do child welfare workers do? Just shut up and smile. You two look very close. Yeah. They can't live without each other. Yeah! Absolutely sure! Nod your head! Do you help out around the house? What do you do at home? Do you have work chores? You do any chores? Laundry! I do the laundry! Yeah! He does the laundry. Chun-seob Are there things in your mind that you wish to do for the children? Things you'd like to do for us. Say whatever. I'll make it up. Actually I've always dreamt of having a family. This is what I've always wanted. First for young Rosie I would like to read her a fairytale every night Yeah! And the twin brats... I mean Jimmy and Tommy, play a game of catch perhaps? As a papa, it's a given! And my oldest son Gordon As he'll be an adult soon, I'd like to teach him Korean drinking. What? Drinking? Yeah, teach him to drink alcohol. You're gonna teach him to get drunk? Shouldn't you be smiling? I'm happy! - Bye! - I love you! Don't come back! Or I'm gonna hit you with a sack! Do you really think this is a good idea? Living together like this without a plan? Everything stays the same. Itjust got a little more difficult than before. We just continue living like we have. Whatever. I don't care! Just tell that asshole Mr. Dough I'll pay him back when I find Mila and put her back to work. What? Mr. Dough got me on the wanted list? Tell him I found her. Tell him she's next to me. Of course it's a lie! I'd be in Korea if I found her! Get your words right! Hello? JANG? What? Twenty grand? Yeah. It's illegal to park the car on the highway and the driver got hurt bad. They said we're lucky it's not more than that. Lucky? Look, June! I should be the one getting compensated. My life is screwed because of that accident! - They'll take the house! - What about me, then? What about me? You pay ten grand. You're partly responsible. Why am I partly responsible? Your mom parked the car on the road and told me to piss outside I'm the victim here! You'd deported without us. Why would I be? The hell with this unfair country! Diner over there is hiring. Show up when I call. You want me to flip patties? Hey! I gotta find that asshole Yang-moo. Yang-moo, you asshole! Hey! Fire! Fire! Bro! I'm sorry! I won't hit you. Where's Mila? Where the hell is she? Mila? I'm sorry, bro. Mila? Don't be sorry! Mr. Dough will kill me anyway. So let's get pissed. This will be a mouth-to-mouth shot! What do I do now, Yang-moo? What do I do here? I'm sorry, bro. - What is he doing? - I don't know. When we would isolate ourselves from the cries of your people Companion us into the world that you so love. Oh God who hears all prayers spoken and unspoken we make this prayer in the name of our lord Jesus Christ. Amen. You may be seated. Today, our beloved member, June will once again share with us her extraordinary gift, her voice. When does this end? When this stop? Damn English! In a little bit, June is going to sing. When June sings, everybody becomes happy. You'll become happy too, papa. It's a secret, but mom said she will be a star. I wanna be like June when I grow up. Do you think that's possible? All I asked was a simple question. - Okay, good. - Thank you, papa! Help me, God. Oh Lord you've searched me You know my way Even when I fail you I know you love me I know you love me At the cross I bow my knee where your blood was shed for me There's a greater love than this You have overcome the grave Glory fills the highest place One can't separate me now You tore the veil You made a way When you said that it is done You tore the veil You made a way When you said that it is done All is done, All is done By your glory, is done We praise you Praise the Lord! Get out! Get outta here! Okay! Yay! Why do they wear shoes in the house? All this cleaning and laundry! The laundry's done but I don't know what belongs to who. How sad to see children grow up in a slum like this. I even cleaned the bathroom with bleach. Good, good. Try as a singer. I never told you but I think it's time you know. I, uh... I have the Minus... or the Midas Touch in Korean music world. I myself have produced countless stars. I guarantee you as a former manager. You're it. Your voice level, tone, range, lungpower... - Just change the attitude. - No. Don't change it. It's not Obama who changes the world. It's Oprah! You know Oprah, right? Popularity is power! You know how much the most popular singer in Korea made last year? There's this one I produced. Her grandma was sick and her mom was a janitor. She worked for her family of five. She bought a huge house two years after her debut. You know how much it was? So if I sing, I make money? Bingo! - Fine, then! - Yes! Then show me the two grand first. - Sell your house. - It's a rental. We need the basic fund to get started. An audition would be the best way. I need that money. Audition, audition... This is the audition you have been looking for! What? The major record labels are searching for the next multi-million dollar contract artists! Hey! Don't look! Super Star K is in the summer. When is American Idol? And the first place winner will receive 30,000 dollars! Is he deaf? Turn it down! This year's WE Audition is back! - Is this an audition? - Yes. - How much is the prize? - It's thirty thousand dollars. - Thirty... - Thirty thousand. Thirty thousand? Thirty thousand dollars! Where's this audition? It's at Atlanta... - A... a... - Atlanta. - Atlanta! - Yes! I know Atlanta! I've seen Gone with the wind. Does he speak Korean? No. Right, that's impossible. Huh? I don't speak Korean. Really. Then are you speaking Chinese? What a cunning bastard. Where'd you learn Korean? From your mom? No. From Janggeum. From the TV drama Daejanggeum? It was so good. I saw it many times. Really? Yay! Good for Janggeum! When's the deadline for this audition? June will never audition. - How do you know? - Cuz of mama. She auditioned a lot. June fought a lot with mama cuz she was never home. Then I'll make her audition. Hammer in the notion of the orphanage. Tell Rosie she'll have to go to orphanage if June doesn't audition. Then she won't have her teddy bear or squeaky shoes. We'll all be separated. All of us. Start talking. Hey guys, what if we show Rosie Oliver Twist? What if we show Rosie Oliver Twist? - What is that? - A movie. The orphanage warden hits the kids and gets them to steal. Nice strategy, guys! What a good point! Translate the point only. But if we make Rosie cry June will kill us. Aren't you scared of June? You scared of a girl? What a sissy! And don't you call me ya'! Then what should I call you? Your Highness. - Your... Highness. - Your Highness. - Your Highness? - Good. Put your hands together. Like this! For Rosie, Rosie, Rosie! One, two, three! No! How can you say that to a child? It's not a big deal. You don't think orphanage is a big deal to us? I mean... But this audition is our perfect chance. Audition? Who says I'll audition? Come on! You need the money, too! The prize is thirty grand! We can pay the twenty grand fine and split the remaining ten grand. - What if I lose? - You won't. I guarantee. I mean even if you lose, couldn't you just try it out? It's such a waste of talent! You're saying we'll be rich if I win? Naturally! And that no one will look down on us if I win. So we should get more loans for the audition? That's what mom always said. She doesn't even compare to you. You guys listen up. I'm not entering any audition. I'm gonna do my best and as much as I possibly can. But, I'm not floundering in a daydream with whatever the talent I supposedly have. One fool is already enough in this house for that! - You're not doing your best. - What? You didn't see what I did? I've done everything I could. Even brought someone like that into the house! You're not doing as much as you can. You're doing as much as you please. Isn't that right? Like it matters. What the heck was that? So... does our sweet Rosie know... what an orphanage is? Rosie. If you go to there, you might meet a nice family. You might meet another mommy who will always be with you or a sister who will teach you ballet since Rosie loves to dance. A home with everyone in same color as Rosie so people would think it's a real family. Don't you want a family like that? Uh-huh, I do. Then why do you hate it so much? Because you can't change your family. June, Maya, Gordon Jimmy, and Tommy... That's Rosie's family. We're real. That's okay. In all honesty I don't like you being here. It always seems that... ...there's hope when I'm about to give up. Like now. Like you. I'm so sleepy I don't know what you're saying. You really think that I can do it? How about the expenses? Don't worry. I... I... I'll pay for everything. Everything in first class! - The kids will all come too. - Of course. I'll audition. That doesn't mean I'll become a singer. Heading to hip hop city and our souls are being ripped apart. No plane, no luxury camper. Just the shame of arriving in a crappy car. Trusting in that ugly gift from the devil that be our mistake! All our problems started when that ugly gift appeared on Halloween day! I'm driving here! Hey! Look at that! Oh my! It's amazing! Gordon! Oh my god! Look at that! If we don't escape to Harlem, it's all because of that ugly gift from the devil! We just poor rappers but to the end. We'll keep on eyes on you, ugly! I think Casper lives here. This place is even worse than Gordon's room! Yeah! You don't know how much my room is worth! Everything in first class? Hey, get out! Get out! Get out! Hey, court lady! Don't miss any spots! They never clean hotels very well. On top of that, I have very sensitive skin. Why am I a court lady? Court ladies just clean. I'm a man. Man is a eunuch. You really wanna be a eunuch? I'd be honored. Eunuchs don't have to clean. Come here. What? No! Not really! But... what would they chop off their balls? What a horrible joke, Your Highness! I'm notjoking. - You still wanna be a eunuch? - No! Get back to cleaning. Hey! Hey! You got your booger on my shirt! When did you come here? You're like the wind. Does she have a cold? You know how much this is? Damn it! Hello, sir! Here! I love you! June! June! I got you something people take before auditions in Korea. Herbal remedy. Take it! It was tough finding that here. You remember what I said yesterday? Keep your eyes on the male judge and smile every 10 seconds. Okay? - And also... - 242 through 246, please. You're up? Just relax! Don't get nervous! You're making me nervous. High five! Little brat. She has to dance, too? - Does June dance well? - What? Does your sister dance well? You won't tell me? Does she know about the dance? She doesn't look like a dancer. We're screwed. Your preselected song, please. - Preselected song, please. - Choreography? Oh. Choreography. Yay! June! June was a dancing queen in middle school! Good job! I knew it! I knew it! That's my girl! That's my singer! - Did you guys eat anything? - No! We are starving! - Aren't you hungry? - Yes! Yeah, I'm starving, too. - Let's go! - Yippe! High Five! High Five! Wait for me! I said wait! We'll make the contract five... or ten years. Advertisements are separate contract. And events? Let's think about that later. She's too big for Korea. She's gotta go global. And I'm her manager! Are you happy that we're all here together? You want me to sing you a song? Mr. Dough you do Korea. I'll go global, you asshole. Sing it loud my love, You gotta sing with your heart now And if you get your heart broken girl Oh I promise it'll be okay You better listen up my baby I got something to say You know it's gon'be good So come on now it's time to rock'n roll Let the music enter your soul Feels good, just like I knew that it would Let go, don't let fear contain you Just let it rock 'n roll, come on I'm here. I will never leave you Let the light within you shine on Let the music take control Let the music take control Hi! Don't be too nice to the kids. You'll end up getting hurt later. You think they'd understand you? Even a real family can become strangers. We're all alone in the end. You think I'm clueless, right? You don't know me. That's what I've learned all my life being backstabbed. Listening to music, huh? What are you laundry service here? - Laundry service here? - I'm not English. You good! Nice one! I knew you'd be sick. You were stuffing your face. It doesn't hurt. In Korea, we even take our teeth out with a thread. I'm a Korean doctor. It doesn't hurt, okay? Look at you. Don't you be smiling like that to any guy. Won't hurt. Okay. Okay. You ate too much. Stop stuffing yourself. You just burped! Unconditional unconditional! My love for you! Unconditional unconditional Unconditional unconditional why does he make it so hard on himself by drinking little by little? Probably 'cause he doesn't wanna be caught so he can drink a lot of blood for a long time. I knew Rosie somehow wasn't growing much these days... I know! This's my first time seeing an actual vampire in my entire life. What do we do? We don't even have a cross or anything! I think that's a charm or something. Hurry up! Wake up Gordon. Slowly, though. Slowly. Wake up, Gordon. Come on. My love for you... who the hell is this? Hi, Chun-seop! Sorry sorry, I mean Mr. SHIN! How long has it been? First time since you split with my money! Surprise! Your friend O-bong says hi. He's doing very well with the nurses in intensive care. Mr. Dough. I heard about the hot rookie, Mila. Pregnant, huh? I don't know what she was thinking. Don't say that. Birth is a beautiful thing. Babies are born so that people can die, right? Mr. Dough! I will be short and clear about this. I found a real gem. This one's a 3-karat diamond. She passed an American audition, in the first round. As you can see, she's beautiful. Her eyes are alive. As fiesty as a cat, and as sweet and cute as a deer. And also... um... She's quite sexy as well. Pervert. You're desperate, huh? What? This isn't it! Here. You know that it was me who discovered Mila. Trust your gut. Why don't you just go and see? Then you'll see what I'm talking about. I already know my life belongs in your hands. Passport. Give me your passport. Good bye, sir! Take care! This is my card. Okay? This is me... Give me a call. Okay? It was great seeing you. - Bye. - Bye bye. - Keep singing. - Okay. How do you know it's a famous agency? - You been there? - I'll know tomorrow. What? You're going there tomorrow? You can'tjust trust anyone! I'm not an idiot. Don't be so foolish! You don't know this field. Kids like you are easily fooled. Plus, you should be consulting me first. About things like this You can'tjust make decisions by yourself. Why not? Cuz we're a family. They just want me to win the audition. He'll get me vocals and choreography trainer til the finals. What about you? This is my chance. You little! She's needs a boob job. Right! Big ones! Good! That was amazing! He thinks he's got her? It's cuz he didn't go to the army. He's got no respect for seniority in this field. I should've gotten her signature on the contract! There's not even a breadcrumb! There is a breadcrumb! If you ate all the bread... what the? Hey! Where're the kids? You... where... Children? Damn this English! Damn it! They all look alike! It'd be hard to miss the pack. Geez I'm hungry! The party's not that good. We'd better go. Hey! Where the hell have you been? The kids were hungry. Who told you to wander the streets? What if something happens to you, huh? Then what'll happen to me, huh? You think that lady with the big boobs will leave me alone? You think I'm worried about you? Not at all! You think you'd be okay if I'm deported? - Papa, I'm hungry. - Hungry? Show time! MRS.

Even if she did file it herself, she's still a minor. How can you go and accept it? Is it that easy to make a request for an adoption? - Not yet? - Not yet. Oh, it's our pleasure. We waited for this moment. She is a very special young lady. And she is also excited about her own new family. - Aren't you, Maya? - Um... Yeah.

Why can't I just do what I want? I don't need audition or the kids. Just calm down! - I'm gonna live my own life! - Stop! I know things are difficult. I know you wanna have fun. At that age girls wanna see boys and go somewhere dark and smooch... when I was young I... But you gotta try your best until the finals. You even brought your family here. Don't worry too much about picking the song. It's your choice so you just... I didn't believe you when you said that I'll get hurt and end up alone. - You were listening? - I still don't wanna admit it. Life's been too hard for that. Can I ask you something? I don't remember my mom. Cuz I hate her. I have no memory of her but hatred. Am I bad? I want to forgive her. But she brought all of us together lived her own life and died her own way. I've never blamed the kids no matter how hard it got. She caused so much pain And suffering in my life. Now I can't even be angry at her. I can never forgive her for that. Am I bad? So, do you wanna live anywhere over here? Do you see that star that's blinking? Yeah. Do you think that's a shooting star? Rosie, what do you think about living in one of these places? I think that one's Cinderella's castle. Cinderella's castle? That's nice. Why don't you wanna go to orphanage? It's not much different from where you live now. Jimmy and Tommy are waiting for their dad. Their dad told them he'll come back when he makes money. Stupid. Parents who leave never come back. Don't they know that? I know that. Yeah? Her nose is running. Has she got a cold? Let's go in. Hello? June! - It's a carnival! - It's amazing! I love this! It's unbelievable! I'm going. Come on! Come on! Great, huh? Hi, kids! Surprise! Mommy! I told those people to set it up when you are all in school. I don't know if it worked or not. But, anyway. If you're watching this, it would mean that I haven't kept my promise again... Oh, I'm really really sorry. But, listen, kids. Will you be sure to cut June's birthday cake together for me? Throw a great party for her! Okay? Oh, I have presents for all of you as well.

I think your mom wanted to do this at home but I brought it here. June, you there? I got some money. I prepared a little something for your party. You must be mad at me again For wasting money, you'd say. Oh, it fits! I wanted to apologize You were right about what you said last time we fought. That I'm chasing dreams and making your lives miserable. But June, youguys are always in my songs. I sing for you guys. And singing for you makes me happy. So I'm always thankful for you. And I'm sorry too. My sweet baby June. Things aren't easy, right? I'll try harder. Try my best. I'll work hard so that my baby June can be happy. I love you, June. Happy Birthday! This is for June!

Window... a... magical goose came and... landed in her... - A beautiful princess. - A beautiful princess! Fighting! EXCLUSIVE CONTRAC Things are on a roll here! Great soup! Stamp it! This is too quick. I'm in a hurry! My girl band is releasing a single next month. I have to get their choreography and do all their PR! It's just that... I'll minus the thirty grand you spent on Mila. I won't kill you and minus thirty grand off your debt. You're good luck. You know my temper, right? I would've killed you already. Thank you. But... If June goes to Korea, what'll happen to her family? They're not her family. They're not blood-related! But she'll never wanna go to Korea because of them. Damn it! Sir, I mean... Come on, Mr. Dough! We got this huge market in US. People kill to come here. Let's first win the audition and release an album. Then Korea's out of the question. You got thirty grand on you? Or you wanna rot in jail in Korea? I'm cutting you some slack cuz you're their papa. Screw this! Rip up the contract and let's go back to Korea. I'll cut you up and see if you got thirty grand in there. Look, you moron. Wake up, you idiot! Smarten up! Then what will happen to her family if she goes to Korea? Well, I don't know. I guess you'll have to help. Yeah? Okay? - Nice job! - Yeah! Yes! Nice job, big G! Rosie! Think this is funny? Think I wanna joke around? Don't you immature brats know anything? Get the hell out. Get the hell out of here! Looking back, I think I liked you the most. We're similar. Both selfish. In the end... Papa! Papa! Papa! I never wake up before 11 am so don't wake me up. You don't know what's behind this friendly-Iooking face. I'll be going to Korea in a few days. What'll happen to the kids if you're giving up your guardianship? - Got more rice? - Asshole. Gordon Jackson, Maya Hashim, Jimmy Taylor... Tommy Taylor, and Rosie Valencia. The children will be sent to the same facility for now. Afterwards, we'll go through the procedure of finding the appropriate facility for each child. June, your custody status is still valid. However because you're a minor, if you can't contact the guardian, you'll need to request police protection. And I also need to be notified. Honey, in this country, we have strict child protection laws. - It's the very basis for... - He'll call. There's still hope. Won't you listen to what I say? You guys, Rosie, please open the door! No! Go away! Please. Sorry Rosie. You just need to be there for a little while. Soon, I'll be there to get you, Rosie. Liars! All adults are lying! June, you're also lying! Gordon, why are you also acting like this? Jimmy, Tommy, open up. I told Phoebe all about your dad, how he might be back for you. This might be for the best, you know? So don't worry about it too much. Do you think they're really waiting for their dad? Do you think that's why they're here? We should've split up at the beginning. Then we just ended up hurting the kids. Jimmy, Tommy, open the door! You know there's no other way! You think it's just the kids getting hurt? Do I look like someone who never gets hurt? Who asked you to get hurt? You could've given up at the beginning if you didn't think you could handle it! What made you stay? Just so you could have a peace of mind? Peace of mind? Then are you running away for your peace of mind? I did my best for our family! I didn't run away like you, and tried to the point where I'm not ashamed of myself. Anything I could do for our family, I... Tell me, June. What makes us a family? Do I need to say that in words? Don't fight. Good! Good! My neck! Oh my God! You must be so worried! Chun-seop! What a bad man he is! He just wanted the contract. I didn't know what was going on. Again, I'm never forcing you to go to Korea. But! Let's think about this together. Next year you'll be an adult. You can bring your family to Korea. But imagine not having any money! Or a home! How would that be? Think siblings will be happy? June, I really wanna help you. But! There's nothing I can do here. I can only help you in Korea. Trust me! Okay? Trust me! Okay? A year max, and your world will be completely different. A new world! Then after that, you can always bring your siblings... - Do I... - Do I what? Do I have to come back here? Hurry up, Chunseop! Hello, Your Highness. This is court lady Gordon. How are you feeling?

Excuse me! SHIN! You wanna be buried here? How dare you sign up two contracts? That's enough! That's enough! Okay, Okay... June already contract me! Okay? You know? Bastard SHIN here? He's a con! A crook! A bad boy! Bad boy! Bad boy! Bad boy! Don't. Let's talk. What? What did he say? - You Korean? - Enough! Yang-moo, you idiot! He's right. As June's legal guardian I signed her contract with Mr. Dough here. It's a nonsense contract, but still a contract. Sir, could you please translate? Make it long this time. He wants me to translate something for him. I became June's legal guardian on October 11th last year when I married June's mom, OH Mi-young. But that was a fake marriage. I gave her $5000 for the marriage. - Really? - Really what? What? He paid five thousand dollars for a false marriage. I'm not a dad. I'm not June's dad. Therefore, the contract I signed as a fake guardian, - is invalid. - I need a unit out here immediately. Look, I don't know how the situation is gonna turn out, so I need some muscle. I don't give a damn where they are! I need them out here now! So now, June's free. Because she has no relations with me whatsoever she's completely free from now To sign her own contract with whoever she pleases. SHIN! You little! And if... If anyone ever lays a hand on my June about the contract I'll take care of that. I'll take claim for any legal disadvantages she might face. You're setting yourself on fire! I guess I'll be visiting you in the hole. Stay alive til you get out ofjail, you idiot! Okay. Don't worry. Get my jacket! You asshole! You did good. Yeah? Good. Good. Very good. Yeah, right! - That's the end? - You're joking! So did she become famous? You're falling for this? Then you should be looking for her! If she's famous, she's like a winning lottery ticket! You'd never know what it's like to be a parent. You're so cool, Mr. SHIN! Nice comment! You'd never find her. It's been too long! You trust him too? Wanna search for her together? We'll split 5:5. Calm down! Damn it! Where the hell is he? I don't have time for this! Hey! SHIN! SHIN! - Sorry, bro! - See the time? We're gonna be late! Look, man! You know there's traffic today! You should've gotten the car ready. You just had to slack off, huh? Bro, I think it's gonna snow. What the? What's this? Mr. SUH? Why weren't you picking up your phone? You know who came by the office today? The girl you always talk about whenever you get drunk! Look! Twins! Yeah! Twins! Yeah! I told you it's her! Papa! Happy Christmas! Thank you! Thank you! Thank you! Thank you! Thank you! Thank you! Thank you! Thank you! And if... If anyone ever lays a hand on my June... Look, man. That's not mine. I don't do drugs, okay? This can cause a serious breach in Korea-US relations. You're ignoring me cuz I'm colored? This is a violation of human rights!
