How can you want to act the fool at this time? I've been up for four hours. - You got a smoke? - No. Hey, I'm watching you! Where are you going? I don't know yet. I might use the money to open a bakery in my village. Or I might go abroad, there's a lot of work there. And you can make money too. Switzerland is supposed to be good. But they say it's hard to get in. My cousin went last year and he had no problems. I'm thinking about it. A few years there and you come back rich. It's never half as good as people say. You'd miss the language, football, all that. You'll make it dizzy, love. Just drink it up. I don't want any more. Didn't you hear? Football players take it to score goals. Gome on, finish it, Pablo. This child eats nothing. The doctor said to take him to the village. Shall we go see that? - See what? - Just some friends. Gome on, Pablo. Have a cookie, darling. Gome on! "SAN MANTIN" BUILDING AND PROMOTING THE HOME OF YOUR DREAMS Here it is. The shepherd was right. And we just went to see it. He'd never buy it. Your brother is a coward. And rightly so! Pilar, the apartment costs 63,000 pesetas and Martin earns 1,300 a month. But it's a steady wage, every month. It all adds up. Look at what I managed to save. I don't know. It's a lot of money for a place so far out of Madrid. It's not so far. - Some day, this'll be Madrid too. - Gome off it! Not a chance. It may be Madrid some day, but we won't see it. - Luisa... - What? Gan I borrow that dress to wear this evening? I've got no money, I'm waiting for my husband. Goodbye, Miss Azucena. They fired you? How could they do that? Pablo, sit still or I'll wallop you. You're driving me crazy. Don't take it like that, I wasn't the only one. There are too many employees. Other places are worse than us. I left the basement clean, now your father will fill it with wires again. Shall we prepare the whitebait for supper? Pilar! Do you hear me? Pilar, my mother's talking to you. She's not talking because she's angry. She won't let me play. Yes, Amalia, we'll do what you want. Then I'll start cleaning them. And you be quiet. You're always interrupting the grown-ups' conversations. Go up with your grandma. Gome on, love. It isn't the kid's fault. - What did you want to tell me? - Nothing. It was silly. Good morning, father. Are you up already? Pilar told me you didn't sleep a wink all night. What do you expect? And I'm so used to the factory hours, I was wide awake at 6:30. What'll you do? Look for something. Why not try Anselmo's workshop? He was very pleased with you. The pig? No, he's an exploiter. And it's a lousy workshop. Lorenzo! Move, I'm going to shake the rug! Wait a minute. Go inside and close the door or all the dirt will blow in. Three weeks and I've found nothing. Everyone's the same. Marcos was lucky. A good mechanic like you will always get work. Hey, Martin! You're a great man! - Hello, mother! - Haven't you gone to work yet? - Is anything wrong? - I'll tell you now. What is it you want to tell me? - Tell him, Marcos. - Yes, tell me. I'm not with Pegaso anymore. - They fired you. - Why would they? - He was third in his year. - The second. The first pulled a few strings, we know. What's up? I wasn't fired. I took the money and left. What have you done? Let him tell us. - I've got a plan, father. - What is it? You and I are going to work in Switzerland. - What do you mean? - Really. I've heard about a town called - Uzwil... - Uss... Mari-Garmen! They need milling mechanics. We just fill in these forms and bring them to the Gonsulate. What do you say? Rubbish. Like your father says, rubbish. I don't see why you have to go so far. It costs you nothing here. Six can eat as easily as three. Don't get involved in their affairs. I heard in the hotel that Switzerland is the country that pays best, even better than Germany. I think a franc is 14 pesetas. I don't think it could be that much. Anyway, I wouldn't leave my family alone. But we wouldn't be alone, We'd be with your parents. We're with them anyway, and it'd only be for a year or so. What? I'd thought of it too. Why are you shaving now? You can do it in the morning. It's habit. And I know you like to see me smooth at night. Martin, I have to tell you something. And I've something to tell you. I didn't know you were so keen for me to go away. I have to get out of here. When we got married, you said it was for a few months and we've been down here 5 years. You were born here, you're used to it, but I can't get used to the basement. We're in the center of Madrid. What more do you want? Do you remember the day you were fired? From the factory? - Yes. - Yes, and? I put a deposit on an apartment. Ghrist Almighty! You did what? I put a deposit on an apartment. You gave 6,000 pesetas? But this isn't valid. Without your husband's consent you can't buy or sell anything, and I signed nothing. I'll go there tomorrow and get the deposit back. Well, you won't be able to. I forged your signature. We tried already and it was no use. If we go back, it'll be worse. Pilar, did you forge my signature? Did you forge my signature? Finish shaving. From now on, we'll each do as we please. Four months' salary! Where do you get that money? I saved it. You saved 6,000 pesetas from what I give you? Yes, I did. You say it as if I'd earned it on the street. I count for nothing in this house. - Are you very? - Don't touch me, please. How are we going to pay it? Weren't you very... very angry? Yeah, but one thing doesn't affect the other. With you, nothing affects the other. I'll go to the Swiss consulate tomorrow. Whatever you want. Gareful! Did you leave the cases on their own? A soldier is looking after them, but you can do it if you want! No, they'll be fine with the soldier. The cases are on board. You should get on, the train's about to leave. Let them say goodbye. We're going now, mother. You're crazy to go without a work permit. - I'm worried. - You needn't be. In my new suit, I'll look like a tourist. - It'll fit you like a glove. - For sure. Is your redundancy money in a safe place? Yes, it's all here. Try not to wrinkle your shirts. I sweated blood ironing them. But the only warm thing you've got is your raincoat. It's summer in Switzerland too. But then it'll be winter. To think that I don't know when I'll see you again! I'll be back inside a year, sweetheart! Son, remember that the sandwiches are in your suitcase. You've told me a dozen times. There are three with salami, three with omelette... That mightn't be enough for all the journey. I'm jealous that the Swedish girls will see your new suit. - They're Swiss, not Swedish. - What difference does that make? Kiss me, no one's looking. Behave yourself with the chicks. No one's controlling you. You're a real wag, aren't you? It's just a joke. - What's a wag, mom? - Someone who tells a joke, son. - Have you got the number of the bar? - Yes, mother. For the fifth time, it's 522834. Isn't he smart? We've just got it and he knows it already. That's us! Gome here, Martin. Take care of them, and take care of yourself too. If things get tough, come back, and to hell with it. There'll always be a plate of food here for you. I know, father. Thank you! Mother, give me a kiss! - You'll miss the train. - Goodbye. I've told you, mother, you're not to worry. - Martin, the train's going. - I'm coming! - Write to me, Marcos! - Goodbye! Goodbye! - Son, give me a kiss. - Don't forget, I love you. - Look after the kid. - I'll write, Mari-Garmen! Pablo, behave like a man! Good evening. Tickets. Transport police. Identify yourselves. Soldier, your permit. I don't have it. Gome with me. No water, the toilet's blocked and we've stopped again. The sea! I've never seen it before. I saw it during the war when I was sent to Valencia. Next stop: The French border. Excuse me, the train for Switzerland? - You're going to Switzerland? - Yes! It's the Geneva train, on platform 2. Hurry or we'll miss it. Thanks for the salami, it's terrific. Eat up, we have to finish it. The Swiss are fanatical and now, with the swine fever, you can't bring this in. - Where are you going? - To a little town. A place called Uzwil. - Are you sure it's in Switzerland? - Yes. Are you sure? Yes. I saw it on the map. It's in the north. The north? That's the industrial area, the German part. - A good area? - You bet! You've got work permits, right? You don't have papers? We waited two months for the papers from the Gonsulate. In the end, we decided to come in as tourists. That's how I got in the first time, but now... My cousin tried recently and didn't get in. Shit! Gome on, eat up. We have to finish this. Good morning. Shit! Do you like it? It's all green, like where I'm from, but the mountains are higher and better tended. Those mountains are the Swiss Alps. You'd better waken your friend. We're nearly there. If they don't want immigrants they won't let them in. Good morning, Lorenzo. Really! Gome along, mother. It says so clearly. Well, they're going as tourists. They look nothing like tourists. Love, they're not going to shoot them! I don't know why he had to go so far. There's plenty of work here. Were you getting on that badly? And you in your village? Shit! I didn't know you were twins! Dammit anyway! Do you not have to pass through customs? Of course I do. I go in the other line, for people with work permits. If you want to go in as tourists, you must have a minimum... We've got enough for that. I've got 15,000 and he's got 20,000 that we got for... Hell, that's enough. Anyway, we're not here to spend, we're here to make money. Right! Two, two. Go on, you two. Good luck! And my family made the sausages themselves, dammit. You still have a salami sandwich. You still have a salami sandwich. Tourists! - The money! - The money! - Were you counting the sandwiches? - Yes, there's still a salami one. I told you. Holy shit! And those two... Good morning. Maybe something's happened. What was that about? Martin, I think we're at the factory. Thank you. What's up? Is there no one living in this country? Look, there's a bicycle. - Madrid. Spanish. - Milling mechanics. Yes, we've come to work, both of us. He's saying something about a fair. Maybe it's closed because they're all at the fair. How can a whole factory go to a fair, for God's sake? That's what he said. The fair? He's taking our cases. What did he understand? - Let's go with him. - He's got my case! This must be a hotel. She said something about a piano. It can't be, but I understood that she's got a spare piano. Yes, it's beautiful. Very nice. The room is very nice. Nice! We don't understand. Oh, yes, goodbye! What do you think? Very nice. And the room? - You old... - Shit! Shit! It's so cold! Incredible! We slept for almost twenty hours. If it hadn't been for the cold, - we'd still be asleep. - Hang on a minute. Watch. If you turn on this tap you get cold water. But if I turn on the other one... Put your finger there. - Shit! - It isn't hot, it's boiling! And look at the size of the bathtub. - You need to crap? - Not right now. No matter, do it anyway. It's worthwhile. Sit down. Touch that. What is it? - It's for cleaning your ass! - What? So, the newspapers... What do they use them for? What? - Goffee. - Yes, coffee. She's got a foul temper. We'll just take the coffee, because this must cost... What are you doing? - What are you doing? - Do you know what this could cost? Gan't I even have one roll? Do you know what it costs? Anyway, I've started it! Then hide it. - We haven't eaten for 24 hours! - Martin! - Dammit! - Drink the coffee. I never thought that emigrating would be as tough as this. How can you be so calm? What if there are no jobs? Back in Madrid they're waiting for money. Whatever you say, love! What did she say? God knows. Shall we go for a walk? Sure. They're in their bare feet. But they don't look poor, they've got great bikes. Maybe they're offering it up to the Virgin. What Virgin? They must have some Virgin, right? Shit, this would be great spot for a swim. But we don't have bathing suits. If there was no one here, we could swim in our shorts. If we wait they might leave. Maybe. Look, they don't need bathing suits. Back home, I swam starkers lots of times in the river. Shit! Look at that lady! The lady is naked. They're all naked. Here he comes. I wish he'd put something on. He wants us to strip off. Well, if we have to strip off, we strip off. What do you mean? If they aren't embarrassed, why should we be? - You were in the army. - No, Martin, please! Gan you imagine your mother naked? What mother? Your mother, who else? Gloria. - Gan you imagine her naked? - Why are you insulting my mother? I'm just saying can you imagine her naked like that woman over there. - Have you seen my mother naked? - What? You think I'd try to see your mother naked? Do you think she'd go naked in front of her children? I'm not saying that! Martin, that's disgusting. As if she'd go naked in front of her grandchildren! Maybe she would, if she lived here. It might be the local custom. - You're making such a fuss. - You shouldn't insult my mother. Shitty little dog! Shit! Gome a bit closer. Gold. Very cold. There are no blankets. Two mattresses... too much for us. Back hurts. - Martin, the breakfast... - Oh, yes! Ana! All right, Hanna. How much the coffee cost? Gollation, no. Rolls, breakfast. Goffee, tea, in the morning, food... - Goffee in morning? - Yes. Free! - Shit. - It can't be! Goffee free? Yes, coffee free. Ghrist almighty! Are you the Spaniards who want to work in the factory? - Are you Spanish? - From Barcelona. - Is there work in the factory? - It depends. What can you do? We're milling mechanics. Skilled operators. Well, we'll see if that's true. - It's what you all say. - Of course we'll see. He was third in his class. Second. I don't care. If you're interested, be at the factory at 7:30 a.m. Tomorrow. Ghange your underwear. There'll be a medical examination and a try-out. The time you've been here without working... The factory will pay that. I'll speak to the owner. "Dear Pilar, The days fly past here. When we arrived, we had... We did a try-out in the factory and we started working. The factory is very big and there are lots of foreigners, especially Italians. We"ve become friends with one called Tonino who speaks a bit of Spanish. There"s only one Spaniard, a Catalonian, but we aren"t friends. This place is clean and pretty but very boring. From work to the guest house. It"s very cheap for what we earn. It"s very clean and the food is good, but strange." I know. "I miss your fried eggs and chorizo and your lentil stews. It was true about the money. One franc is 14 pesetas. So we get 13,000 pesetas a month." That"s incredible! "Before we know, we"ll have paid for the apartment. Give my regards to my parents and my sister Luisa. Remember to go to the estate agent and get the receipts for the money I sent them. A big kiss for everyone. With love from Martin." Luisa, add a bit more methanol. The flame is going out and the child will get cold. Is dad coming for Ghristmas? - I don't think so. - Mom, is he coming? No, darling, he isn't. What if I ask that from Santa instead of a rifle? Just in case, ask for both. Now, give me your hand. She asked if we wanted more coffee and I said yes. Is that what she asked? We were right to get the girls to invite us to have some cakes. They're happy to. We should persuade them to have the Ghristmas Eve supper here. It's the best place. I was going to mention that. Erika has invited me to her house for supper that night, - with her family. - That's even better. Why not ask if we can bring Tonino? Me, no. I'm going to Naples, to see family. Martin, I don't think you understood. What? Erika invited me to supper. Mr. Schneider, the foreman, is going too. I'd like to get to know him. - You really don't mind? - Who, me? Get going or you'll be late. - Well, have a good time in Zurich. - I hope so. They'll be picking me up any minute. Good night, Martin. Happy Ghristmas. Well! You look lovely! Gome in. Yes, I won't lock the door in case someone hasn't got a key. You'll get a fright some day. Goodbye, Hanna. Happy Ghristmas. What's wrong? Why won't you come in? Oh, Luisa! I miss him so much. As soon as I can, I'm going there. Are you crazy? Damn the! What's up? I couldn't stand not being able to talk to anyone. Weren't you going to Zurich? We're a right couple of party-goers. Gome down, I've got a surprise. Gome down! You nearly killed me! What's the surprise? Happy Ghristmas! - And the glasses? - We'll drink from the bottle. Do you think I brought the whole bar? You're a wimp! Shit! It's frozen. Is it cold? It's good. There's no one here. Other people were looking for them too. They left a few weeks ago. Pilar? Pilar! Mother says you're not well. What's wrong? I didn't want to tell her, she worries so much. - What's wrong? - We've lost the money. - For the apartment? - Yes. It was a swindle. But, how? All of it? All that Martin has sent since he left. A year's work. You look pretty. Were you at the movies? No, at the dance. Have you reported it? Yes, of course. I went to the police but they did nothing. We aren't the only ones. There are lots more. Marcos, come on. - No, they might be annoyed. - Gome on. It's not like we were sneaking into the bull ring. The Swiss are really something. One poster, and it's in Spanish. We must be only ones who don't wash our hands after urinating. Are they going to take long? I've got a load of work. - I can pick up your wages for you. - No, it's all right. Look, it's no secret that you earn more than I do. Why do you say that? Mainly because it's true, even though you seemed to think you couldn't tell me. - By the way... - What? Hanna, she's crazy about you. She asked me if Sunday is your birthday. - What did you say? - That it was, - and you needed a cuddle. - You bastard. You little guys from Madrid! Hurry up! Do you know why we're little? Because we just have one father, not like others. - One day I'll smash your face in! - Yeah? Don't worry, I won't hurt your little pal. Well, for Martin's birthday and Hanna's invitation. No, not at all, I'm paying for this. When you come to Madrid, my girl, I'll make you the empress of Lavapies. It's a Spanish song, from Madrid. Now it's the women who ask you to dance. I told you. Yes, but... Hell, go out and dance. I'm going. Remember what I told you? You take the parcel, you put it on the floor close to the counter and push it along with your foot. Don't let them see you. If they do, they'll take it and we're bringing it to dad for his birthday. If they see it, will I go to jail? No, children don't go to jail. How do you know? You've never been here. Look at their faces. Excuse me... Harmonie? Give me a hand, or are you going to stand there? You look like you've seen a ghost. What are you doing here? Martin didn't say anything. It's a surprise for his birthday. He doesn't know. - He doesn't? - No. Where is he? He's in the factory. You work Sundays? Is today Sunday? Then, no, we don't work today. - It smells bad, mom. - Yes, it does. But it's you, Pablito. You smell bad. - And you? - Me? Where are you coming from? Me? From Mass. - From Mass? - Yes. - Looking like that? - Yes. You're the one who smells bad. What do you mean? It's the child... - Let me see. - What? Poop, poop! Goddamn... Marcos, for God's sake! - Where have you been? - I don't know! - My new raincoat! - You seem sillier than ever. - Is this the guest house? - Yes. Where are you going? Hey, wait! Incredible! It's lovely! It's all so lovely! Are the rooms upstairs? Pablito, you've got very big. Gome with me. - No, you smell bad. - Listen to him. Which door is it? Martin's? Wouldn't you like some breakfast? It was a long trip and the boy... Is this it? You're annoying me. Get out of the way. If you need me, I'm downstairs, all right? Pablo, wait here. What are you doing, dad? Pablito, son! Is that you? Yes, Martin, it's both of us. Wait a minute... What's she saying? She's Hanna, the owner of the guest house, and she's brought breakfast for us. For you and me. Very kind. Yes, the people here are very kind. Does the child want anything? Gola-cao. They don't have that here. An Ovo Maltine. Thank you. I fix this. You not worry. Gome on! Tell me, what the hell are you doing here? Happy birthday, dad. Didn't you want a stew? Your son risked his life to bring you all the ingredients in that box. Have you sorted out the problem with the pots? I can"t cook without pots, you know. Can you just leave me alone? What"s wrong? You"re very pale. Prepare another room for Martin. His wife and son have arrived from Spain. You know what? It had to happen sooner or later. It"s better that it"s happened now. Shit, a year's savings! A year's savings! Now what do we do? We start over again. What matters is we're together. Look, if we both work we'll have a house sooner. You're not going to work. Why not? Other women do. Because I don't want you to work! Because I'm perfectly capable of supporting my family on my own! Listen, calm down. Look... If I don't find a job, I have to go back in 3 months. I'm on a tourist visa. But I can tell you this, I'm not going back to the basement! Especially after seeing all this. You see, son. Maybe we'll be a bother for dad if we stay. Don't be silly. And don't involve the child. You're not bothering me but I don't want you to work. What can you do? You don't have a trade. Do you think you get money for nothing out there? Don't worry, I'll find something. Be careful with the cars! We don't want any accidents. It's here, dad! What's here? I found an apartment to rent. Pilar, please, don't get obsessed about apartments. Isn't it nice? The owners live on the first floor, we're on the second - Want to see it? - I haven't said yes yet! - Good morning! - You'll love it. You"re welcome. Mrs. Seewald! Is it true? Have you rented your apartment to foreigners? Yes, to a Spanish family. To Spaniards? And they"ve got a child! And? Well, really! Lt"s huge, and full of light. But how much does it cost? That's not bad. We each pay 30 for our room. But that includes breakfast and cleaning. - That's true. - Let me show it to you. Pablito, let's pick your room. This is the kitchen. You can see it afterwards. Look. This stove keeps the whole house warm. And look at this. Look at the view! You like it. Yes, a lot. Does this guy speak Spanish? - Not a word, and he's deaf as a post. - Then, how... We've seen the two bedrooms, Right, Pablito? - Yes! - This sunny one is for Pablo and me. I want him to sleep on his own. On his own? Do I get the sitting room? Listen, I'd like to live alone with my family. We've never been able to have a place of our own. And until we can save enough this will be our home. It isn't asking too much, is it? What do you say? What can I say? And if Mari-Garmen is about to arrive it's crazy to be all here together. Fine. Fine. What are those things? He says they're the landlord's, the Swiss throw nothing out. You have to go down and thank them. All right, but give me time, I've just arrived. I should have thanked Hanna and I didn't even say goodbye. Because you didn't want to. Let's forget about it. Tonino, a radio! Inter and Milan are playing today. Yeah, but we haven't got one. That's the television I told you about. We'd get three channels. We'd get Austria and Germany, we'd get Switzerland. - Look, it's lovely. - No, Martin! Hurrah for the bride and groom! Stand here, we'll get our photo taken. Who's she? What are you doing here? Where are your parents? Are you Italian? Where are mom and dad? Don't open your eyes. I won't. - Open them. - Let's see. So you bought it! Damn you, anyway. Don't you like it? Yes, I do, but there are more important things. That's great. All right, switch it on, we'll see what it's like. Tonino, switch it on. - Look at that! - It's like the movies, mom! Yes, those little aerials are very good. Like hell, we've hooked it up to the deaf guy's aerial. The landlord's? A roof aerial costs 40 francs. Look, look! If they complain, Martin... The shame of it! Well, at least don't sit up late. School begins tomorrow. Do you remember what the policeman said? Yes, I heard you, school begins tomorrow. I'll take him, I'm on the afternoon shift. Look at that! Pass me the plate. - What are you eating? - Tonino made it. What's it called? I turn my back and you're eating junk. My wife... factory. Police: "Children, school". And my wife: "Martin..." - Martin is my name. - Yes, I know. You"re late again, Adriano. The police told us. It"s all sorted out. Tomorrow, you bring slippers and leave your shoes outside. Tomorrow, you have to bring slippers and you leave your boots out here. But today... he have... cold. Don"t worry, it"s very healthy. You can go barefoot, the lady says it's very healthy. How much pay? - Pay? - The school. You don"t pay anything. It"s free. Dad, don't leave me on my own, I don't understand them. Don't worry, and behave yourself, the school is free. Dad! Don't leave me on my own! Pablo, behave yourself. You'll understand them in no time. Behave like a man! In this class, I've explained how babies come into the world. I hope you"ve understood. Have you any questions? Yes, Pablo. It"s like that in Switzerland but in Spain babies come from Paris and a stork brings them. That"s not true! We don"t believe you! Is that true? Did they fly you in? Yes. Me and all the Spaniards. No, that"s a big fib! All right, that"s enough. I'll explain about the stork another day. Come here, Pablo. They show everything. And then their husbands are away for two weeks. Here they do military service till they're 50, and the wives are alone. Do you think that while those two - were here on their own? - Who knows? Just in case, I don't ask. - Really! - Talking of husbands, how's Marcos? He hasn't been to see us in ages. Since he was promoted, we've got Swiss people in the house all day. It's Herr this and Frau that. You're lucky! At least you meet people. He does all the talking. I don't understand anything. I just cook. Mom, the teacher wants to talk to you. Gan't you say hello? - What does she want to tell us? - I don't know. They laughed at me when I told them about the stork. Babies are born differently here. They come out of their mothers! What is it? Did I say something? Go out and play. Your father will talk to the teacher. It's like we were saying. How can you tell a child that? - That explains the adults' behavior. - You're right. Anyway, are you coming here for Ghristmas Eve or not? - I have to do the shopping. - Yes, of course. That guy insists I've taken something. I've never stolen anything. I didn't steal anything. Yes, he did. I saw perfectly how he took the tin opener. I'm taking him into that room and search him. They're going to put you in that room and search you. If you've got it, get rid of it. Don't be stupid. If they find it, you'll get thrown out of the country and you'll never get back. I'll try to distract him. Get rid of it. Well, then, what"ll we do? - We"ll go into the room. - All right. How long have you worked here? Two years. And I saw clearly how he put it in his pocket. Liver! From here. Liver. Li-ver! A fillet of liver. My mother wants a fillet of liver. Oh, a fillet of liver! God, he certainly isn't the brightest man in town. I asked him forty times. I've told you forty times what it is in German and you don't know. Of course I know. But he didn't make any effort. Where's your father? What I don't know is what he wants for supper on Ghristmas Eve. Go and look for him. I'm really sorry. I could have sworn I saw him... No, no. Happy Christmas! Aren't you ashamed? I've never seen so much of everything. Dad, mom wants to ask you something. Gome on, son. Hey, Martin! Your hair's gone white. I've walked from home in -10?. I don't have a friend to drive me. Gontacts, Martin. By the way, we can't come on Ghristmas Eve. Don't say that. We've bought all the food. Pilar said you'd come. We can't. We're going to see Herr Iseli, I can't let him down. Are you all right? - You're shivering. - Leave me alone. Help someone who can repay the favor. Leave your personal problems at home. Touch me again and I'll tear your head off, you... - You'll do what? - Have you two gone crazy? Martin, please! One thing, Marcos. When you see me in here don't say hello to me. Aren't you drinking your tea? Are you still thinking about Marcos? You know what I'd like? What? I'd give anything to be sitting on the Gran Via drinking a beer and watching people walk by. Martin, come here! - I thought I'd made it clear. - Don't talk rubbish, come here. Go to the office, your sister is on the phone. What's happened? Hurry, Martin. Luisa wants to tell you herself. What is it? His father is dying. Let me do it. Don't say anything to Pablo. Why make him suffer ahead of time? Take it easy, Martin, please. I won't make it. I won't be able to say goodbye to my father. - How are you? - Thanks for coming. They rang from the airport. You've got a ticket for Madrid tomorrow at 12:00. - Is there nothing earlier? - No. Then I'll take the train from Geneva this evening. You'll gain a day by taking the plane tomorrow. - Mari-Garmen, I didn't see you. - Don't be silly. That's done. Why don't you try to relax a bit? - I'll make coffee for everyone. - I'll help you. They gave Tonino the day off to drive you to the airport. If you don't mind, I'd like to go too. How could I mind, you old bastard? - I'll mess your clothes. - Don't be stupid. Your grandfather loved you, Pablo. Would you like to go back to Madrid? For a vacation? No, forever. Forever? What about my friends? You'll make new friends there. But there are no forests or rivers, and it doesn't snow in winter. Well, don't think about that. I'll race you to the farm with the big tree. Last one is a faggot! All right. Dad, what's a faggot? Dad, what's a faggot? I'll tell you later. Shit! Hanna! Heavens! I haven"t seen you in ages. Yes. How did you know that? I heard you"d got married. Yes. It"s true. - Is that your son? - Yes, it"s Pablo, the little boy who... Yes. Pablo, will you go for a walk? I want a word with Hanna. Well? - How are you doing? - Fine. Hanna, I've come to say goodbye. I'm going back to Spain with my family, to Madrid. In the end, you all go back. To your homeland. Hello! This is Peter. - Your son? - Yes. - Good looking, like his mother. - Hola. - Is this his friend? - No, she"s his sister. Hello. - Hello. - Let"s go and play. Yes, she"s five years old. She"s Maria. But... She"s five years old? Yes. Maria. A very Spanish name. She"s very dark... It"s an Italian name too. I'll come back as soon as I earn the money for the trip. You"re a boy. How can you earn money? I don"t believe you. You"ll go away forever. No immigrant comes back. But I'm not an immigrant. My parents are. I'll come back. I adore Italy, but I don"t want to live in Italy. After a year here, with my first savings, about 1,500 francs, I bought a car. It was a beautiful car, second hand, but beautiful. A flame red sports car, with the rims painted white. The best thing was that the roof opened. A wonder! I adored that machine. It was everything for me. That summer I went to Naples to see my family. That night, I slept at my parents' home. The next day, when I went down to get the car... They'd destroyed it. They didn't steal it. They'd completely destroyed it. They'd scratched the hood. They'd pulled out the steering wheel. They'd slashed the tires. And all for what? For nothing. Just to hurt me. It's an envious, cruel country. Gountries aren't cruel, it's poverty that's cruel. I know what I have to do. I'm going to marry a beautiful Swiss girl, I'm going to go to Italy on vacation, but I'll put the car in the garage! That's my Tonino! What lies are you telling each other? I was telling her about the deposit - we've put on the apartment. - Some deposit! The apartment my sister found for us costs 500,000 pesetas. The savings from six years of work. - We both worked. - But now we've got an apartment. Until we get it, we'll live with my parents in San Blas. I didn't know that. I'm not going back to the basement. Don't worry, and don't do anything until we write. - No, we're not in any hurry. - Martin, we'll miss the train. - Gome on, Pilar! - I'm coming! Martin, did you tell Emil that we want to move in? - No. - Tell him, please. Emil, my friend Marcos and his wife would like to rent the apartment. Yes, it"s still free. - No problem? - Shout, he's deaf. No problem? - No problem. - Thank you. - You"re welcome. - It's yours. - Thank you. - Well, Martin, good luck. - Ma"am. - Goodbye, Martin, stay well. See you again! My dear. - See you again. I'll write to you. Thank you for everything. Gome on, girls! Get in the car, we'll be late. Gome on, hurry. Gome on, legs in and... Why's he here? I said nothing. It's all we needed. I heard you're going back to Spain. Take care. Pablo, get in the car! Gome on! Goodbye! - Safe trip! - Take care. - So long, you lot. - I'll write to you. Good bye! We want to hear news from Spain! Smile a bit, you look like corpses. Dad, why have we come to such an ugly place? I don't know, son. It's not ugly. It's just very hot and you're not used to it. Don't say it's ugly in front of your grandparents. Pablo, love, you've got so big! I'm going to take out the money, it was digging into me. By the way, love, thank you for sending me money all these years. Ssh, Martin knows nothing about it. Where's father? He's making a mattress out on the waste ground. We weren't expecting you until tonight. Do you want to see him? Guillermo! They're here! Pablo! Gome here! Is that him? What's he doing? He repairs woollen mattresses. Go and give him a kiss. Gome closer. Give me a kiss. Didn't you tell him? We said he'd had an accident. I wasn't expecting this either. I saw him at my mother's house but he had his false leg on. Guillermo, put on your leg, you're scaring the child! Pass me the leg. What's wrong? It doesn't hurt anymore. I'll pass it to you, father. But, Pablo... - Kill it! Hit it on the head! - Hit it in the eye! Are you hot? No. Want some more lemonade? It's very good. I don't want anything. Mom, are we never, ever going back? Don't think about that anymore, love. You'll make yourself sick. It's your first day. Tomorrow we're going with your grandma and your aunt to the new apartment. Try to go to sleep. Get some rest. Gome here. Another kiss, for all the ones I wasn't able to give you. That's enough. My cheeks are sore. Leave the boy alone. They're coming for lunch tomorrow. Goodbye. I'll see you out. Do all the windows look out here? Yes, all of them. Don't act surprised, you knew it. But the apartment is big and the kitchen is nice. No, it's fine, but your sister said it had a lot of light. But she lives in a basement... Don't knock my sister, she found this for us. So in six years we've gone up three floors, and it's old. That's it. From what I hear, you've come from abroad. We arrived from Switzerland yesterday. How long were you away? Six years. - I don't know how you stood it. - Why do you say that? They're all racists up there, aren't they? Are they? Don't say they're not. Everyone knows they treat Spaniards like dogs. Are you saying they treat foreigners like we do? Everyone wants to come here. This is better than anywhere, isn't it, son? I prefer Switzerland. - You asked the right person. - This is fixed. Let it dry, and in half an hour you can wash the dishes in it. It won't move. We're off, there's a football game. So long. The bottle! Thanks. - Dad... - What? Did they treat us badly in Switzerland? No, not at all. Why do you say that? Why did those men say it? Because Spaniards are very welcoming to foreigners. Sure, welcoming to Germans with big wallets and Swedish girls with big chests. "Don"t hurry back. Things are better, but only for the usual people. I'm finding it hard to get work. After working for six years in Pegaso they wanted me to take a test to start as a skilled worker. I refused. I tried with Marconi, Standard... Apparently in this country I'm considered old so I had to swallow my pride and take the test at Pegaso. It lasts a week and is on a level for engineers. Even you would have trouble and you were second in your year because the first had contacts. I'll tell you if I get it but I doubt it. I don't want to end up with Anselmo the pig. Maybe you remember him. Kiss Mari-Garmen and the baby for us and say hello to our colleagues, friends and enemies. We are well and send our love, Martin Vargas and family." What a disappointment. When we're here we miss there and in Spain we miss Switzerland. We're from nowhere now. I'm not risking it. We're not going back without something definite. How can he go back to the pig"s workshop? Boys, is Anselmo here? No, he's in the bar. As usual. You're Martin. And you're Saturnino, my maestro. Are you still working? What else can I do? I wasn't as lucky as you. Are you still in Pegaso? No, they fired me in 1960 during the crisis. I went to Switzerland. Yes, the crisis. In this goddamn country we're always in crisis. Why are you here? You're not looking for work? Yes, I am. But I'd have come sooner to see you If I'd known you were here. Don't change the subject. Don't come back here, Martin. It's not for you anymore. There are just a couple of old timers and two kids here. You don't come back to places like this. It can't be that bad, you've been here a lifetime. He lent me money. I've been repaying the favour for years, and ruining my life. Don't bow your head to that bastard. You'd give him the greatest satisfaction of his life. - I'll go and see Anselmo. - Don't bother. He's seen you. It's Mr. Martin, the one who said he'd never again set foot in this lousy workshop. - How are you, Anselmo? - Mr. Anselmo. I bet I know why you're here. You're desperate for me to give you a job. - Well, I... - It's not that, Anselmo. He's come, like a gentleman, on a visit. He's working in Switzerland. Is that true? He's a gentleman, something you've never been, and a gentleman never lies. I came to say goodbye to my maestro and thank him for all he taught me. I'm going back to Switzerland with a great contract, earning thirteen times what I earn here. When I'm there, I'll write to you. I could find something for you. What are you all looking at? Get back to work! Or do you want to go to Switzerland too? Martin? Is that you? What happened? I couldn't ask Anselmo for a job. This is shit, Pilar. Let's go back, dad. I don't want to go to that school. Work hard, schools are expensive here and yours is the most expensive. If you pay the priests so much why do they hit me? They hit you? Not just me. They hit the boys with keys to make us stay in line. They use a ruler too. - But they hit me more. - Why, love? I'm left handed and I make lots of spelling mistakes. Very well. Family meeting. Sit down. Sit down! Given all this, what do we do? I think we should go back to Switzerland. I could easily get my old job. Yes, let's do that. School has just started in Uzwil and as it's free, even if I'm late, it doesn't matter. Well, well. So the two men in my house are cowards. I encouraged you to go but that time is gone. We went for money and we got it. And it was tough, wasn't it? Or don't you remember? We won't be driven out of our own country by the heat, or Pegaso, or the priests, or by this lousy apartment that cost us the sweat of 6 years. You'll get into Pegaso because you're one of the best around, and if a boy hits you, Pablo, hit him back. I've seen you do it before. And if it's a priest, you tell me. I'll sort him out. And another thing. Having a grandfather who's lame is no cause for shame. I'm going to do my homework and do a crib. Dad, do you know what a crib is? Yes, I know what a crib is. Just study and forget about cribs. I didn't know. He's catching on. I'm going to have a beer in the bar at the corner. They want me to install a trip switch. Shall we walk down Alcala Street? It's crowded, just like Uzwil at this time. Shall we have a beer? And watch people walk by? Yes. And watch people walk by. And supper? To hell with supper. We'll get something. Forget about the cribs! What's one slap more or less? You wait here. I'm going to tidy myself up. Dedicated to them, to all of them.
