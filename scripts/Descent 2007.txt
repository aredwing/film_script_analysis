Saw that bitch the other day, and I was like, why are you always up in his face? And she was like, "don't go there". Anyway, he better keep his thing out of that smelly trash before saying I got me some fun going on. You know what I'm saying? Right? You see, she agrees. Come on. She knows. She remembers. ...and even the eggs of intestinal parasites may be preserved. What at times disturbs the purity of the archeological deposits is the discovery of fossils belonging to the burrowing rodent. They die naturally in their burrows long after humans have occupied the site. That's it for today. Don't forget your assignments, for next week. It's hard to say. It's still really early. Right. Right. That's what I figured. You know what? Mom, I gotta go. I gotta lot of work to do. Oh, okay. Cathy asked me who you were seeing these days and I just didn't know what to say. Tell her I'm not seeing anyone. So... there's... no one? Why, like... what do you want me to say? Fine, tell her Gustav, I'm all into Gustav. Who's this? I changed my mind. Where did you meet him? The bookstore. Well, what's he like? Hmm, well, he's kind of a square. I am so relieved that you're meeting boys again. Mom, I gotta go. You know, he's waiting for me. He's right with you now? He's right in front of me. Well, I'd like to meet him. I think you should. Hey, oh, I'm so excited you're here! We'll be back, okay? My God. I'm really glad you came. Allison said you wouldn't. I think you intimidate her. She's something. You think? This year feels so different. Like it should be better, you know, but it's not better. I'm drifting. Rooming with you was kinda like having an anchor I didn't even know I needed. I'm serious. Why are you so amazing? You're the amazing one, that voice. Yeah, I sing... Old man time... why you gotta be unkind? Old man time... I feel so alone. That was beautiful. Thank you. You must take lessons. No, but I'm gonna. You're an angel. You know that, don't you? I was just telling my friends that. You were? I told them you were special. Real special. Where you going? Out the door. What's your name? Maya. I'm Jared. You are a beautiful girl, Maya. Well, Jared, there are a lot of beautiful women here and I'm sure one of them might find your crossing-guard a bit endearing - but I'm on my way out. - Wait. Wait. Wait. Let me ask you something. I mean, how does one approach such rare beauty and not come off the clumsy fool because...? So that line has worked for you? Has a high success rate? This was its maiden voyage. And I'm about to retire it. Why are you all such phonies? Tired and obvious lies. You say that and it just shows how little you think of me. Try the truth next time. You know those cold days, so cold, you just can't feel your face cold, and you start to figure how many more steps before I'm inside. If I slow down I may just not make it. I first saw you on one of those days. I just caught you smiling right there in the middle of the arctic blast and I nearly stopped dead in my tracks. Your eyes, were just wide and intense, you were reading some letter, and then you let out this laugh that was so natural, it was glowing. And I wanted to smile too but my face just wouldn't budge. Then you walked right past me and I was relieved somehow because I wanted you to look up but I was afraid you'd stop smiling... And then I just had to let you pass me. And I turned around but then you were just a black coat and a red hat walking away from me. I've seen you a few times since then... followed you a couple times but nothing. Nothing. This was my chance. I couldn't let you go. That was flattering, Jared... in a restraining order kind of way. Come on, just give me a chance, okay? Let me get you a drink. Okay then, let me get myself a drink, okay? We'll go out back, and just talk and get to know each other. - Alright. - I mean it, just talk. Great. Great. Just talk. Scout's honor. I'm guessing Cub Scout. He took Ben out back and started whaling on him. What? You know, he was just bustin on him, giving him the shit. That's how brothers are. No hard feelings. All because Ben didn't wake Jesse up. Jesse's funny that way. Sounds funny-farm funny. You and your brother, you two never fought? Not over something so stupid. Come on. Brothers and sisters only fight over the stupid stuff. Think about it. Who knows you better? They're like master button-pushers. All right, I admit I may recall an incident involving a hair clip of mine being turned into a slingshot where in which I might have overreacted a little bit, and, throwing my brother in the closet for about three hours. Ah-Hah, I see. Okay. Any more twisted little tales I should know about? Not at this time, your honor. So I was right about fighting over stupid stuff. And you admit being wrong for once. Maybe. So, in conclusion, the court finds Maya guilty, guilty of being a tired, obvious liar... and sentences her to one amazing kiss from the prosecutor. I'm suspending that sentence. It's late. And the verdict will have to be returned at a future date. Good night, Jared. Future date. I hope spring's eternal. I didn't know what to say to you. I don't. I'm not sorry. I didn't fuckin do anything. You okay? Just a little tired, I guess. Here are the support beams. Thanks. I don't think there's a place for you here. You see the problem is I have three T.A.'s already and they won't let me take on a fourth. I just wish you would have come to me sooner. Do you realize that last semester you didn't seem interested at all? It's just that I thought I wasn't gonna have the time but I realize now I'm ready to make that commitment. Really it's a shame. Well, my loss completely. Well, the department has rules and my hands are tied. I'm sorry. I understand. I just had to give it a try. Standouts. Students like you are stand outs, Maya. Smart and articulate. That's a powerful combination. I shall miss your input. Well, first on my list next year. Maya, hey, it's Jared. What are you doing? You know, it's been five days exactly since we met. Happy anniversary. I've been thinking about you. I was thinking we should go to some really fancy restaurant, and just make a romantic night out of it. I've been thinking about you a lot. I like you, Maya. I want to see you. What are you doing tonight? Come on out. Come out. We'll make it a night to remember. I try to get the guys to listen but they shoot me down. Curious. Football. What's that all about? It pushes me, makes me prove myself. You know, kind of like you. But with you it's just not fair, this way you got of seeing right into me. Go ahead and try. Read my mind. Come on. It's a big void. That's all right. You'll find out later. Pepper, please. Thank you. You know I could have been a concert pianist. ...by the time I was twelve I had my own recitals. Big hopes for little Jared. And then? I turned thirteen. Somehow sitting at the piano not so cool but hanging out in the woods drinking and partying. Yeah, like, why tickle the ivories when I could be tickling the girls? You wasted your gift. No, just outgrew it. It was too controlled, not spontaneous enough for me. Give me, give me a challenge that's dynamic with bite and real risks. I can do without all the mental yo-yo-ing. Bringing that music to life. Yeah, two hundred years ago, as it was being created, that's when it lived. Playing it now is like resurrecting the dead. Why hang on to the past when I can create my own moments now? Beauty like that is hard to find. I have something I want to show you. This is my sanctuary. A place to go when things get out of control. I'm always sneaking up here. It's like... You ever feel you're flunking out in every way and no one notices? Ever feel that? Sometimes. Yeah, it melts away up here. A trillion stars each with its own planets, and its own moons. Suddenly, it's hard to take anything so serious. Check this out. Come on. It's beautiful. Yeah, that's the sight that clears my mind, and erases all my pain. You ever been hurt before? I've had my share of pain. I kind of doubt it. You're an expert on my pain? There's just something missing, that's all. A sadness, an edge, maybe, I don't know. That's all. You wouldn't know. I only mean that it's, it's packed real low, you know? It's deep, it's not for public viewing. But why talk about these things? Blah, blah, blah. Everything's the same afterwards. Right, the fact is he was a great guy. He still is I imagine, and every reason was solid and structured, no loopholes. Amicable in every way. And the hurt's all in my head. I need to get over it, I know it, and I will. There's always the stars. Catch! Oh, she's a pro. They still make these? What happened here? You and I don't mix. The little squirt broke my foot once. My cousin had a beat-up one, plastic all stripped off. I threw it straight up, higher than all the boys, and it flew right into the pool. It became a big, soppy sponge, real heavy. And I tried stomping on it... I found a nice Cabernet. Never doubted I would come. You never know. You can put that down now. Sorry. Here. We should take it downstairs. Don't. You tap, they die. How's the air up there? Up where? You ever see how they look at you? The boys. Look at me how? Like a juicy plum their dry mouths aren't permitted to touch. Is that right? Their eyes get all helpless, needy. I've seen that look in your eyes. I'm a quick learner. Like silk. So fess up, where you from? Baltimore. That's not what I mean. God, you're so goddamned perfect. Little Miss Perfect. Enough, Jared. I mean it. Okay, I give in, let go. Let go! Off! Off! You like that, huh? - You like that? - Don't! Get off of me. Fucking savage! Hairy. Hairy fucking... Sewer grease. Look down at me, huh? Look down at me, huh? You fuckin' maggot... you fuckin' nothing... You fuckin little... Nigger. Little nigger, nigger with attitude. Fuckin maggot. You fuckin maggot. You fuckin nothing. Nigger with attitude. Little Miss Shit. You smelly fuckin' baboon cunt! Oh God. Oh God. Oh, you fuckin baboon cunt... baboon bitch... Oh God. Do you lighten up. Lighten up. Oh God. Oh God. Oh God. Oh God. Oh God. God. SPRING It was a bright day like today that I too began my trek into the wilderness, my odyssey into the wholly unknown. It's for those of you today standing at the precipice of your future, preparing to tumble forward, that what I'm about to say, I hope, may let you soar. Three words. Simple words. So simple, in fact, they have no meaning without context. But understand them, believe them and you too will live a life, whether it be short or long like mine, with no regrets. It's these three words that society and all others who are not you unconsciously fear. But, if you choose to heed them, heed them carefully, quietly... You... are it. Take a second, think about it but just know that no one else... No one knows what it's like to be you. Hard as they may try, other people see you only in terms of their lives, their experiences. Don't let them decide what's right for you. Your every step is yours as is the path you walk on. Yours alone. Hi honey. Ow, your brain dead mother fell asleep in the sun yesterday, and now I'm a crispy red. Ouch, you're bad. He's calling me "Hyawatha". He is so bad. Anyway, we're really going to miss you this summer. Our first summer without our little girl. I'm sure you'll have no problems getting a job though. You get along so well with others. Never a dull moment, that's what I love. Always on your feet, always keeping busy ...now that is retail. This is just the beginning of our busiest season. Now everyone can fold, but there is an art to it. Now, if we want the piece to sell, we have to care about the fabric. Appearance is everything. All right. See. Here, give it a try. Now watch for those wrinkles. Okay. Keep it loose, let it breathe. Right, that's it. Good job. So you go to Claremont? I took a class there once. That's where I met my ex. Ron was his name. I don't know how he got in there he was so stupid. Anyway, that's Ron, you're Maya. He must have been the stupidest person to ever graduate from there. I mean, sometimes I sit home and think about how stupid he was and just laugh. Oh, so stupid. Oh really you had to be there. I am just lucky he's gone. I mean, even his name is stupid. Ron. Say it enough you'll realize it. Ron. Ron. Ron. Ron. Ron. Ron. Ron. Ron. Anyway, that's Ron. I thought you should know. You guys are right. Total bitch. - Slammed. - Mission impossible. Leave it, okay? Details? It doesn't matter. Come on, spill it, Johnny Tingle. You're our only hope. All right, all I'm going to say is that I was so fucking real, that it, it hurt. Share your pain. Hit us with dialogue. So cold that she didn't even look at me. And I ask her, "what do you do in your spare time?" She says, "I fold. " You got that in common. Fuck you. You know, she told Seline, that in her spare time she likes to build houses. This girl does not build houses. She builds houses. That's a "dykey" thing to do. See, how am I supposed to score if we're not even playing the same game? Hey. Going for refills? How you feeling? Fine. I put her in the closet. You know the rules, Adrian. She goes out back. I can't just throw her out in the street. I just can't. Sure you can. Hey chica, you're with us. You want an apple? I got an apple. Where am I? Where dreams come true. Comfortable? Why did you bring me here? I wake up and here you are. Such beautiful lips. I want to cry. I don't understand. It don't matter. Look at me. The eyes are innocent and sad. You're not ready. I'm sorry. I don't have my purse. Adrian. He'll have it. As much as he loves us, he don't trust us. Adrian? First door to the left. He helps the helpless. Last night's a blur. Yeah, well you got burned. I'm not catching. Well, you're playing with fire, you know... Why are you here? To get my purse. You've been hanging around a lot. Yep. But you're not twenty-one. I saw it. Nineteen. A million times I have seen it. Pretty just like you. All that and more. And she ends up hurting. Are you trying to save me? Eh, fuck it. Just get out. Don't be mad, baby. You brought me here, remember? Why so cold? Help the helpless? Lost cause? I DJ tonight. Come by, hang out in the booth. You're not that smooth. Yeah I can get pretty rough sometimes. See how they bleed into each other, sharing themselves with total strangers... They need me... I love it. You never went down. No, I didn't. That's okay. It's better up than anywhere. No one to hurt you. Except when I lose it and go POW! And then you're in trouble. Maya, Maya. What's up? So, Maya, you party hard, Maya? Oh, you got? Support. Support. Don't worry about it, Maya, I got you covered. I'm okay. You gonna offend him. Try a little. Yeah, send it this way. She's cool. You know Danny's here, right? And? You're the only reason he's here. Hey, Maya what do you think of that guy? Huh, is he cute? Yeah. You want to meet him? Sure. Later, he usually needs a couple of hours to warm up. You see, cause this guy, like, what the hell is this? You love it. Hey. Who's the clown with the silly cap, huh? Hey Danny. You said that you liked it. Yeah, on the baseball field, maybe, but not here in the hood yo. Okay, fine. Happy now? Can you believe this joker once spent five hours in the pouring rain waiting for me to come out of the club. You know, I remember that. That's not cool. Yeah, he was all wet, crying... Hey, ask, don't take. Fine, Adrian can I please have a smoke? Smoke mine? Sure. So, go ahead and smoke it. I'm not gonna smoke it in between your toes. Yeah, you are. Good boy. So, Maya, you and Adrian... you know? Why do you let him treat you like that? He's just having fun. It's all good. He's not trying to hurt nobody, really. Really. You know you have beautiful feet, you know that? Go ahead... kiss it... Deeper. Yeah, you are. Yeah, you are. Yeah, you are. Yeah, you are. I had this girl once... like you, a college baby. She said she had all the answers. But, you know what, she crumbled at all the wrong times... yeah, I fucked her good though. But I'm hearing shit yo. Shit like "Watch the bitch, she'll cut you down, that soul is mean and cold... " ...But I see 'tude not ice... My player's all growing up. Oh, I'm liking that. I'm down with you letting loose, being you. But don't forget who got you there, who made you real... I schooled you. So why go back? You got nothing to prove. FALL Ladies and gentlemen, good morning. May I have your attention please cell phones, pagers, off. Every semester I'm blessed to share my voyage with three world-weary travelers. I'd like you to meet the Nina, the Pinta and the Santa Maria. They are my eyes and ears. Treat them well. They also have mouths. So Tim, why don't you introduce yourself. I'm Tim Banks, grad student emeritus, seven years and counting. This is my fifth year as the Santa Maria... ...and I do feel world-weary. I'll be running the discussion groups on Monday and Wednesday nights. I look forward to meeting with you. Thank you, Tim. Maya. I'm Maya, undergraduate. I'm on Tuesdays and Fridays. Do you see how a few extra steps gives you the momentum to knock a guy's block off. Well, that's the way it's gonna feel when you play them. They're bigger, faster, stronger. Now we're gonna play it at the line this time... See that pain you're feeling, I want you to fire it back. Go. Tonight the Claremont Falcons take on the Eastman Lions in a war between teams that goes back six decades. It's under way. It's kicking it off. Joe Goodman gets it for the Falcons and tackled down just short of the fifty-yard line by Seth Hall. So we get an opportunity to look at the young man, Mike Mason, making his second start. Tell him, hit me, it doesn't matter. He stumbles back, off balance, and I catch him just enough to send him flying. I gotta say if he turned just the wrong way he'd be. Are these real? Hand 'em over, asshole. You man enough to take them from me, pretty boy? You fuck! Something in there you want, huh? Lose the fucking attitude. Marcie... Happy anniversary. It was exactly two days ago that we met. Pens down. Bring 'em up front. Jared. I saw you. Huh? I saw you cheating. I'm reporting it to Professor Byron and the dean's office. You're shitting me. What the fuck? It's your word against mine. You could have called me right up there. Why'd you wait? Setting up some private time, some you and me time. I think you're hooked on me. That's cool, you know. Nothing to be ashamed of. You want to see me again? That can be arranged. Ah, you're a sweet girl. I still see that. So what do you say? I want to see you again. I brought you something. All right. Get comfortable. You are truly beautiful. Thank you. And you... are really sweaty. I came straight from practice. He's riding us hard for Midstate. He's... You been to any games? No. For real? Oh shit, you're missing out on me trying to impress you. Saturday, I catch it at the two, take a mad dive in for the TD. Everyone's just going wild. It was good. You don't need to lie. I'm not lying. I don't go to the games. But I follow. I follow you and you didn't score a touchdown. You didn't play. I played. It's okay. Really. Words don't matter anymore. You came tonight and that means the world to me. To a night to remember. A night to remember. So, I'm all yours, as I promised. ...at your complete disposal. So when does this night to remember begin? I already thought it had. I mean, what do you got in store for me? Maybe you should look to the stars. All right. You gotta let me take you and show you something beautiful. I promise you you won't regret it. I don't regret. Well, that's good, you know, cause what's the point when you got now just staring you in the face. I'm starting to learn that myself. I want you to stand up. What for? It's my night. You promised. Strip. Embarrassed? No. Then... take it all off. Cold? Uh-uh. You're shaking. I'd light the fireplace... If there's one! Don't... I can't help feeling you're not at home here. What's mine is yours, you know that. Seeing you, you here now, is more than I imagined. Not a scar. No blemish. Just pure old-fashioned perfection. What every girl wants... - Eyes to the sky. - Oh God. Yeah. I want to make you feel good. I was such a stuck-up bitch before. It's okay. I know how I was. I'm not a prude though am I? You're a big boy. You can take what I give you? You know... I believe you. You got it? Yeah. We're almost there. Lie back. You're my kind of guy... my hero. Not the kind of guy to wimp out. You know what it's like to have fun. You know how to let go and fuck the rules. You like things spontaneous with bite and real risks, and I remember that. I thought you were crazy. But you opened my eyes, you made me realize we're not so different. there's? No more talking! What the fuck? One more word... and you lose the tongue. My turn. My turn to talk. Just talk. No worries. Scout's honor. I was gonna say what harm can come from talking? Right? Like that night at the party. I knew you. I let you talk and retalk and rephrase and ramble on and words, they kept piling up and I couldn't see you anymore. I had a secret admirer. Nervous, and eager to please. I kind of felt bad for being so harsh. You know, you being so open and straight up and me just a meanie, calling you a tired, obvious liar. Isn't that funny? Funny how words create ideas. Ideas are hard to shake it turns out. You come up in dreams. Walking alone to that restaurant, that night. That's where it always starts. I know I shouldn't but I'm excited, and I'm kind of nervous. You know, it's a big, fancy restaurant, and... So then we're sitting there, across from each other. And it's a diner, and we're talking and drinking. But this time, we dance. I mean, it's more like grind on each other. And it's a club. And oh, am I on fire, just swallowing that music whole, and there you are... just smooth... real smooth and I can't believe you're keeping up but you are and it's right then that I know that you're the one, my forever... So we're playing pool, right, and I am so going to beat you, I just know it and that makes me giddy because now I know that you're the one I'd do anything for and that makes me vulnerable, you know, so, so I need this... ...something on my side. And I win, and everybody's watching, thousands, and the applause just sweeps me up and, and I look at you. I know I did wrong... and it's now that I remember who you are. The fog lifts. And you take me right there on the pool table. You know I knew not to struggle. My eyes are closed but I can hear them gasp, some giggle as you... I need you. I need you, baby. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. Shut the fuck up! No one wants to hear from you! Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, you like that bitch. I can't hear you. Mine now. You're mine, yeah. Oh yeah. You fucking maggot. You fucking nothing. Take it all in. Yeah, you like that? Do you want me to keep going? Jared liking this? Little Jared... He knows what he likes. Come on... give it to me. Down way. Yes, help me. he's know how to wrong? That's right. That's it. Make me feel it. Puta! You like raping smart girls, huh? Make them feel small and stupid. Stupid fuck. Who's streching you now? Like that. Love it. Take it off him... Make him see his Daddy... Yeah, mira. Hello, fairy cake. Huh? Yeah, you never forget your first one baby. Puta, you like it. You want me help you, don't you? Sure? Fuck you! I'm not a fucking fagget! You're mine, maggot. Fully mine. Look at that She made a mate All over the stuff. You love it, hun? Hairy bitch. It's the sports, you see, school ya all wrong... Teaches you to accept defeat. I mean, look at you. Nobody accepts it better than you. Hey, you got water? I'm getting thirsty. Everything's ok now, right? It's ok. I need to get over it. I know it, and I will.
