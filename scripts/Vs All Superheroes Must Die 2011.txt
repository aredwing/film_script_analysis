What? He's going to kill us. He's going to kill us because... Because of you. Who... Who's he? Hey. Where you going? Where you going? Come back. Just hold the fuck on, okay? Get me out of here! Untie me! Fuck. Good evening, everyone. So glad to see you could all make it out tonight. It's me. Rickshaw, your very best friend. Oh, now, don't look so surprised to see me. I thought, after last ti, that we would never see each other again. But, um, I guess I'm surprised too. Here we are all again. Doing what we do best. Charge. Shadow. Cutthroat. And The Wall. My very, very best frien. I can't wait to introduce you to some of my other fries you haven't met yet. But let's cut to busines. All my life, as you know, I've been a loser. At every turn I lose. I think I have an amazing plan. And then... Asshole goody-two-shoes like you get in the way, and fuck it up. So I made a game for you to play, where you get to feel what it feels like to lose all the time. I'm calling it role reversal, where you get to lose, and I get to win. to have the rug pulled out from under your feet at every fucking turn. Therefore, the rules are incredibly simple. There are over 100 innocent civilians spread all across town, and they are rigged to various life threatening devices. You play my game, you save their lives. You don't play, I kill them. You try to escape or forfeit, and the entire little sht town is rigged to blow. And, oh, I just can't... I just want to press this fucking thing so ba. Unless of course you win. But in the meantime, I'd like you to reconnec, at the Laundromat. And when you're all reunited, you'll get your first assignment. And... Cutthroat. Just to let you and your friends understand the true severity of the rules... No... Oh, oh, I almost forgot. If you've noticed the little injection scas on your wrists... It's just my little way of making the game more.. Fair. May the best man win. It's been a long time. Yes, it has. How you doing? You... You still have yours? What are you... What are you talking about? You're... You're still strong. So that injection did do something to everybody. Everybody except you, it seems. Ben. John. How's it going? Kiss my ass. That's how it's going. All right. Glad to see things haven't changed. Jill. Charlie. This is great. Everybody remembers each other. Rickshaw's not bluffing. He just killed someone. What? Yeah. Splattered his brains all over the bathroom wall. Oh, Jesus. Yeah, when I woke up, there were bunch of bodies everywhere too. All right then. Let's address the matter at hand. You know, the one where we're up shit creek. Hey, we are not all the way up shit creak. Oh, let me guess. You have a plan. Guys, what about the real obvious question here? I mean, how did we even get here? Hello again. Since we don't have a lot of time... I guess we should start the games. Now, this round will see you separating into two groups, You have five minutes to proceed to the hardware store and... Choose your weapons. Then the round will begi. Show up late, and one of you will have a real mess to clean up. All right. Come on. What? So you got a map, that makes you the leader? What are these for? Nothing good. Looks like we have about 80 seconds to find out. John. Stop, stop, stop. John, they're in trouble. Hey. Look, we're in trouble, okay? Now, we don't know if those are innocent people, Jill. Those could just be his goons or something. We don't know. What if they're not? What if they're moms? Or dads or kids? We don't know all the boundaries of this game yet, okay? Look, he's watching us. As long as we're still playing, then he'll keep us alive, okay? So then we just do nothing? No. Play the game and win. Hey, don't worry. Don't worry. I have a plan. As long as he thinks I'm still playing, he won't know what I'm doing. Okay? Come on. Hey, wait. You look good. You look the same. Where'd you go? There's two innocent people ready to blow in the back. So let's pay attention. Fuck, man. I'm sure by now you've had a chance to look over your weapons. Choose wisely. Or else the game will end very quickly. And we wouldn't want that, would we? You'll now be split up into two teams. The Wall and Shadow are Team Romance. And Team Irony will be Cutthroat and Charge. Each team will be matched p against an as yet unannounced opponent. The rules of round one are quite simple. I mean, I keep my shit simple. Okay? Fight your opponent to the death with your choice of the weapons laid in front of you. Fail to fight and 10 innocent civilians will die. I'm not fucking around. Team Romance will go to the junkyard. And Team Irony will go to the lumber yard. Each team has five minuts to get to its destinatio. Once you arrive, you will receive your final set of instructions for the first round. Happy hunting. What should I pick? The sledge is safe. Hard to miss. Usually if you hit somebody with it, they don't get back up. Just got to hit something, huh? Yeah. All right. Take care of her. Hey. Why didn't Rickshaw take your powers? We don't really have that much time to figure it out, do we? No, we don't. Listen up, everybody. We need to stay on time. He said, "this round," which would make one believe there's gonna be more than one round of this shit, okay? And we stay in touch. I know this is hard for everybody, okay? I know. If we don't do this together, we don't have a shot at beating this game, okay? All right. Let's move. Hey. Be careful. You too. Ready for this shit or what? Yeah, let's hope so. Let's... Let's hope so? Can't have our leader eating shit this early in the game, now, can we? Hey, keep it down. Make me. Hey, man, hey. This isn't about us, all right? This isn't about our past. This isn't about how I hurt your feelings. Or any other bullshit complaints you've had about me over the years, all right? This actually is life or death. Do you get that? Look. We lose, we die. Okay, once we get out of here, we can sit down and point fingers at each other. But right now, if we slip up just once, he will find a way to kill us. All right? Look, I'm not gonna get in your way, but this doesn't change shit between us. Well, shit happens, I guess. After you. So, where do you think this place is? - Who knows? - Northwest maybe. I've never seen it before. Yeah, me neither. So how long do you think we were all out? I don't know. You went down hard though. Do you remember how it happened at all? No. Nothing. I just don't understand. Rickshaw was gone. John got him. Yeah, I know. We were kids. Did you ever tell, uh, John about... No. But he knows. Awesome. Hey, there it is. Round one. What the fuck is that? So good to see you both again. Welcome to round one. The rules are quite... You got it. Simple. If you look to your left, you'll notice that there ae five innocent civilians. Innocent civilians. And now, if you'll move your attention to the fu, which has already been l. The fuse will burn out in 95 seconds. Enter the cage, defeat Sledgesaw in under 90 seconds, deactivate the bomb, free the civilians. Or option two, do nothing and Sledgesaw will kill the civilians and you Also, any attempt to unte the innocent civilians will be considered cheating, and we know heroes don't cheat. Okay? Fuck, you have 80 seconds. Good luck. Son of a bitch. Stop the fuse. Where you going? You kill Manpower, or the five innocents in the truck will ignite. And you know what? I've got the only fire extinguisher You know, I'm starting to feel what it feels like to win. Shit. Good luck. What the hell is a Manpower? Where is it? I want you. Let us see you fly again, little birdie. All right. Let's do it. Fuck. You are nothing. Now it's my turn. God damn it. Come on. Have you guys got any bright ideas? It won't stop. Fine, I'll be right there. All right, big guy. Put one right here. Yep. Oh, shit. Okay, we probably got about 20 seconds till this thing blows, right? Find anything you can that's sharp and cut it now. Jesus Christ. Right. Let's get you guys out of there, huh? No. I'm sorry. No. We still save them. No, we run! We could've saved them. If we'd stayed any longer, that'd be us burning over there too. John! John! John, we need your help! Jill, where are you? The junkyard, we need you now! Okay, don't worry, we're on our way. Come on, let's move. What's wrong? I couldn't save them. It's not your fault, neither could I. I could have if I was still fast. Our friends need our help. Yeah. I'm gonna charge in there, I'm gonna grab him. Should I sneak up behind him? Damn motherfucking flamethrower! No, no, just clean up the mess. Dinner time. I'm gonna want to cut your heart out, boy. I'm going to want to eat it. I want to get big and strong again. Two for the price of one. You both look so tasty. You first! Charlie! Yummy, yummy, yum, yum. Quiet, quiet. Okay. Let's party. Hey! What the hell? What the hell is this? It's blood, man. No, no. This... This thing in my stomach. This... This tight thing. It's pain. You're hurt. Is this what happens when you die? Yeah, I mean, you feel pain. You're not going to die. You... You sure? Yeah. Let me... Let me look. Okay. Yeah, yeah, yeah. You'll be fine. Just... Just hold that there, okay? Just go in the garage and get me a T-shirt or bandage or something. Yeah, yeah. It's all right. Just keep pressure on it, all right? Just right there, hold it. Okay. Okay. Okay. You okay? Yeah, I just got the wind knocked out of me. Well, you're lucky. Just forgot he could see me. Yeah, I know. Hold on, hold on, hold on! Thanks. Yeah. Okay, here. Easy. Easy, I'm going to put this on. Easy, easy. That feels funny. Yeah, I know, but it's good. It'll... It'll stop the bleeding. Just hold it there, okay? Yeah, okay. Okay, you're going to be okay, all right? Just... I'm going to go over here for a second. Just... Just stay right here, all right? Okay, cool. All right, cool. What's going on? Charlie's screwed, all right? He's gonna die soon. What? How long does he have? Hours or... Minutes, maybe. He got stabbed right in the stomach, and pretty deep. At least he doesn't understand what pain is, so he'll go easy. There's nothing we can do. What about the garage? Isn't there something inside there, medicine or something? a 12-inch stab wound from his lower intestines, Jill. I'm sorry. I know you and him are close. Just go. Stay with him until it happens, all right? It'll be pretty soon. Just go sit with him, all right? Charlie. Hey. How are you doing? Good. Fine, I think. We're just gonna wait here a minute and see what we're doing. Okay. You're gonna be okay, Charlie. It's going to be fine. Let's go check the innocents. Did we win this time? I don't know. Jesus. At least we're not detonating them. What are you talking about? When they blow up, it isn't coinciding with the times he's been giving us. He's watching us. When we get close to them, he just blows them up. Just to fuck with us. He wants to make us think we can win so he can just pull the rug out from under us. So what the hell do we do? You see any transmitters on the innocents? What? No. That's because they're tiny. And if they're that small, in order to remote detonate, he has to be somewhere in this town. You sure? Yeah, I think so. You got a plan? Just keep playing along. Charlie, Charlie! Charlie! Jill, I'm sorry. He just said he was feeling better. And then he just died. I couldn't do anything. It's okay. I'm sorry. What are we gonna do with him? We could just... We could just leave him here, until we figure all this out and we could just come back for him. Jesus, John! I don't know what else to do. What are you doing? Wow! Round one sure was exciting, wasn't it? I mean, I do feel bad for The Wall, though, you kn. He was kind of stupid, though, wasn't he? I thought for sure he was going to make it at least to round two. Oh, well. Forever young and all that, beautiful corpse. Anyway, I'd like to take a moment to applaud all of you, for your hard work in round one. You saved zero civilians, and barely saved yourselve. All right, all right, I won't fault you for the warm-up round. But now we're on to round two. And I'd like to call this the bonus round. Charge, since you seem to like maps, I'll let you fid the way for the others. You have five minutes. Five minutes to make your way to the old shack. It's down off the dirt road, on Parker Ave. Once there, I'll give you the final rules for everyone's favorite bonus round. Bonne chance! I'm glad you came. I'm kind of drunk right now. Are you sure you want to do this? Of course. I mean, just means I'm doing what I want, right? Yeah, I don't want it to be a mistake though. - That's impossible. - Guess what. What? I like you. Shit. I'm so... It's our night off. Yeah, I know. Okay, so I guess I'll see you tomorrow. Yeah. Okay. Jill. I'll see you tomorrow. Here we go. Guys. These coffins have our name written on them. What? Bonus round, huh? Don't look at them, he's just trying to scare us. Well, it's fucking working, John! Why isn't Charlie's name here? Because this is all part of Rickshaw's game. He was always planning on Charlie dying at the junkyard. So what then? We keep playing by his rules, we keep listening to what he says, expecting him to play fair. I'm done playing fair! Yeah, that's just what he wants. So I guess he wins then. Hello, ladies and gentleme, and welcome to round two, the illustrious bonus roun. This round will be the most fun yet. And even though our favorite contender, Char, seems to have developed some resistance to the injectio, I've created a game even that tool box can fully enjoy. Now, you've seen your coffins? If not, take a moment, Now, on the opposite wall, you can see our party guests. An honors high school student, a mother and a gentleman who works at the hospital. Now for the fun part. Now, this game is the simplest yet. And you know how I love simple. The gun on the table has three rounds. For each one of you that shoots themselves in ther respective coffins, You have 60 seconds to decide, then the bonus round will expire. And above all, have fun! John, don't! John! Don't, John! Just don't look, Jill. No, Charge, come on, man. Jesus Christ, Charge. Shut up, Ben. Don't let... Don't let him win. Listen, you can't let him win. I'm not. John! You never disappoint for an entertaining evening! Excellent job, man! Go fuck yourself! Oh, well. Anyway, you all look like you could use a drink. Make your way over to the bar for round three. Hey. You okay? I shot three innocent people in the head. Not doing so good. We could have done something else, John. We could have... We could have what? Couldn't risk either of you falling for his game in there. Jill, he was going to kill those people no matter what, okay? At least I could make it quick for them and save the both of you. You're just doing what he wants. All he wants is for us to suffer and die. He doesn't give a shit how. We got four minutes and 15 seconds left, let's go. What do we do? Nothing. John's got a plan whether I like it or not. There's one thing Rickshaw will never be able to manipulate. What's that? He never loses. It's not an ego thing. He just... Failure just isn't an option to him. What now? There's no innocents in here. I think the more pressing question will be, why the three of us and only two guns? And now, for round three. I call this one the elimination round. I'm sure by now you've noticed the two guns on the tabl. And... This one is my favorite round yet. It is Cutthroat's time to shine. Cutthroat's never been able to overcome being a fucking sidekick. And now is his chance for payback. Behind curtain number on, we have his sweet sister Emil Emily, such a sweet girl. Please help me. No! No! Ah, ah, ah, ah! Cutthroat! You cheat, and she goes boom all over you. "Emily! Ah!" You son of a bitch! I can only imagine what sweet nothings are coming out of your mouth right now. But, but, but! Let's keep our composure, shall we? Cutthroat, you have 90 seconds to kill either Charge or Shadow, it makes no difference to me. You kill one of them, your sister lives. Ben! The guns on the table are merely a suggestion. But feel free to use whatever means you want to make your kill. You have 90 seconds on the clock. And, go! Ben, please! Ben, don't, okay? Rickshaw's gonna kill your sister anyway, unless we both figure something out. What? Like when you figured out the bonus round? No, that was different. She's my sister. Ben! Please don't. I'm sorry. Stop! I know where Rickshaw is. He's here in this town. We can beat him! Ben, please help me! Please, Ben, help! Ben! Just stop, okay? Just think! This is exactly what Rickshaw wants! I'm not going to let you kill my sister. What? All you ever did was put me down and tell me what to do! What was I supposed to do? You're like a little brother to me. I was trying to protect you. Maybe I didn't want a big brother, huh? You needed one. Stop! Stop! This isn't saving your sister. Okay? When has Rickshaw held up his end of the bargain tonight? We can beat him! But I need your help. Okay? I need your help! Your sister needs your help. Ben, help me! You can't fucking fix this, God damn it! There's no way. We're all going to die anyway, right? Thanks, but no thanks, man. Drop the knives, Ben. You got it. No! Fuck it. Ben? Ben? Ben, man, I... Shut up! Just kill that son of a bitch! Yeah, yeah. I'm sorry for being a dick, I was just... I was just trying to... I was trying to... Not your fault. Not your fault, I was just jealous. What? I just wanted to be like you. What are you talking about? I wanted to be Charge. Tell Shadow I'm sorry about stabbing her. Yeah. Are you okay? Yeah. Bro, thanks for, um, last night. It got bad quick. Hell, they all knew how to fight. Yeah. But you got the girl out, right? Yeah. Yeah, she's cool. Good. Good. You just... You just got to be a little more careful, man, I mean... What would've happened tonight if I wasn't there? Yeah, because you could've taken them all by yourself. No. It's not what I'm saying, man. What are you saying? Just take the extra second and think before you just jump in there. Yeah, and if I had taken that extra second, that girl would be dead! Shit, man! I'd rather it be her than you! What happened to using what we have to save people? You can't save everybody, man. Yeah, especially if you're not trying. See you tomorrow. Shit. Does it hurt? Pain is just a suggestion. So how do we beat him? What? You told Ben that we can beat Rickshaw. Yeah, in theory. Well, what's the theory? Well... He can see us, but he can't hear us, which means he's probably just tapped into the town security cameras or something. Remote detonates the innocents. The charges are tiny, almost invisible. Which suggests that he's probably not more than a couple of miles out. The repeating static every four to five seconds on the TV is a quirk of a black market briefcase broadcast system. They're small, they're easy to set up, but short range. And all of his broadcasts are always clear and sharp. Which means he's probably not more than half a mile out. I've been marking down on the map every time we've ever seen one of his TVs. And if I get just one more of his broadcast locations, I can probably sit down and triangulate his position or something. I don't know. Than what are we waiting for? I don't want to get anyone else killed. It's just me. Why did you always distance yourself from me, John? Distance myself? I was in love with you. Why do you think all I ever did was train all the time so I could fit in with you guys? So I could just have an excuse to be around you. What are you talking about? Jill, why do you think I keep getting older, but you guys just stay the same age? You're not getting older, John. Yes, I am. Every day I look in the mirror, all this changes. You still look exactly the same as when that thing fell out of the sky. It gave you and everyone else powers, but nothing happened to me. I always wanted it to, it just... It didn't. And that's what Rickshaw doesn't understand. The injection didn't work on me because I don't have anything to take away. Why didn't you ever tell me any of this? It doesn't matter. Look at me! It doesn't matter. It does matter. It matters because... What happens five years from now? When my body can't take this beating anymore, and I can't protect you. What happens when I'm 70 and you still look 17? John... Wow! What a round, huh? Whoo! Well, the good news is that the finals are coming up. Same story, five minutes. Report to the thrift store. Thrills. Chills. The fucking works! Oh... And don't forget to bring your guns. You okay? Yeah. Good. Let's finish this, huh? Yeah. Let's do it. So exciting! The finals begin. the entire store is loaded to hell with explosives. Fail this round, and... Fuck, kaboom! It's all over. Now, since you are both armed, it will make this round quick and painless. If one of you isn't dead, and I don't care which, then the whole fucking store explodes. Try to leave the store, and... Fucking kaboom! Now, look, I know this is a poignant , touching moment for you both, And as always, you know, I don't really mean it, good luck! I can't. Yes, you can. Hey. John, if we try to escape, he'll blow the whole store. We're not gonna escape. You are. What? If you shoot me somewhere convincing... I'm gonna pretend to die. And then you're going to run out of here. No. No, no, no. And when his eye is transfixed on you, I'm gonna triangulate his position, and then I'm gonna kill him. Is this it? Is this your plan? I mean, what's your backup plan, John? Back up plans are for people who expect to fail. Hey, this is gonna work. Are you out of your mind? I mean, I'm not killing you. You won't if you do it right. If we don't at least try, he wins. Without us, who knows what Rickshaw will do? This isn't just about you and me anymore, this is about everything and everyone we've ever cared about. I have to fix this. I can't. Here. Just aim a little right. No, my right. Don't shoot me in the heart. What if this doesn't work? It will, okay? It will, okay? Trust me, babe. Okay? It's gonna be okay. It's gonna be okay. All right? It's gonna be okay. No! No! No. No, no, no, no. It's gonna be okay, all right? Just run. Get out of here. You're not okay. I'm fine. I'm fine. Just run. Just run. Just run. Please, you can do this, okay? Listen. You can do this. You can do this! You're sure we should do this? Can't just ignore what we all have. Well, yeah, I mean, people are good at shit all the time. It doesn't mean they go get in everybody's business If someone's getting hurt right in front of you, do you just walk away? No. That's all I'm saying we do here. Cool. Sounds fun. Yeah, I mean, why not? Guys, this isn't just stopping people from getting hurt. This is going to be dangerous as shit, and if we make a dent, someone's gonna get fucking pissed about it. That's why we all should just be careful. I'd never let anything happen to any of you guys. If it gets too crazy, we just walk away, you know? That's it. Okay. Yeah? Yeah. All right. Let's do it. You? Me. I've tried, Charge. But your little town just expired. What did you just do? What did you do? Boom! How do I deactivate it? How do I deactivate it? God damn it! Jill. Hey, Jill, it's . Okay, listen, babe. You've got... Five and a half minutes to get the hell out of here, okay? This whole town's gonna blow. But don't worry. I got Rickshaw. You just gotta get your ass moving, okay? Where are you, John? Honey, I can't hear you, but you gotta get moving, okay? You're wasting time. I don't know how large the bomb radius is. Good. Go. No. No, Jill. What are you doing? No. No, no. No, Jill, do. Jill, stop! Don't come after m. You have to get out of here now, you hear me? Don't come after me! You hear me? Get out of here! See you soon, asshole. Hey. Hey. You okay? Jill, I told you not to come. Look at me, I'm... I'm done. You know, if you see someone getting hurt in front of you, do you just walk away? Carrying me out of here is going to be like trying to escape in a wheelchair. You only got, like, two minutes left. Please just... Well, then we better hurry up. You're not the only one who gets to save people around here. Come on. Okay.
