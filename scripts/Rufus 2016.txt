Give me the amulet and walk away. I'll even pay you for your troubles. A king's fortune. Sorry. Idiot. You see, I am not a cruel man, Chang. I have no wish to shed blood. But do not take this to mean... I won't. So nice of you to drop in. I think it's fair to say, Mr. Chang, the amulet is finally mine. Time to let it go. As you wish. No! Find me that amulet! Hello there. Manny Garcia. Nice to meet you. Manny Garcia, gosh, golly, it is my pleasure to... make your acquaintance. Remember, Rufus, you only get one chance to make a first impression. Blow that and all your hopes and dreams wash away. So I gotta nail this. Okay, Rufus? I'll try... Garcia... Manny Garcia. Sorry. How about... yo, yo, yo, Manny G is in the house? Manny G is in the bathroom. And he's been in there all morning. At the moment, this house only has one working bathroom, Manny. I need to get in there. Sorry, Dad, it's just the first day at a new school, in a new town. I gotta perfect my Manny mojo. Your mojo will be fine. Just be yourself. "Be yourself." That's all you got? Son, I gotta go. "Be yourself" is not bad advice. You're a wonderful young man. Look at this face. Who wouldn't want to be friends with you? See, even Rufus agrees. Manny Garcia, Sagittarius. Hi, I'm Manny. Rhymes with "fanny." Definite nope. Whoa, lots of new faces. Whoa. Controversy. New school colors take Taft. The old cobalt and white are out. Red and blue are in. Where do you stand, student on the street? Um... Don't have a strong opinion yet. I was in Texas until like last week. You're new. Apologies. Paige Prescott. Ace reporter for "The Taft Tattler." Manny Garcia, ace... new kid. Well, welcome to Taft Middle School, Manny Garcia from Texas. Hey, one more man-on-the-street question. Our spring dance is just around the corner. Theme is still open and suggestions are welcome. What gets you up and moving? I guess my dog, mostly. Dogs? K-9 themed. Original. I shall suggest this to the committee. Interview over. Well, here we are. School sweet school. And the new colors look good. You're gonna do great. Thanks. And, um, anytime you wanna interview me, I'm there. Manny Garcia, I think you're gonna fit right in at Taft. Yeah, I think so. Now, that's front-page material. Sorry, Manny, we're not moving back to Texas. Connecticut's where our jobs are at now. How bad can it be? I was blue! Okay, the whole school saw it happen. I know it wasn't an ideal first day but it'll get better. It was embarrassing. Okay, I have no friends here. I wouldn't say "no friends." Yeah, you've got the best one ever right there. And he's been stuck inside all day. Come on, Rufus, I found a cool park near by. Whoa, boy. Whoa, hey, boy. Okay, easy, easy. Can you get it? Bet you can't. Come on, there are rules to this game, all right? Easy. There she is coming up. Looking to the left, looking to the right. Can Rufus steal? No, he can't. Garcia gets it. Squirrel! Got ya. And goal! Rufus, where are you going? No, no, no. Rufus... Dude, you're a soaking mess. Mom's gonna kill us. What's that? A necklace? What, you wanna wear it? There, now you're the coolest dog in all of Connecticut. Happy? Man, wet-dog smell. Come on, Rufus, we gotta go home. I can't believe I have to go back to that school tomorrow. What a first impression. Let's get some sleep. Don't worry, you can keep your new necklace on. Here. Go to bed, boy. Come on. Good night, buddy. You're a good friend. In fact, in this town, you're my only friend. I just wished you were the kind of friend who could talk back, be there for me at school. Maybe make my life not so generally... lame. Manny, rise and shine! Okay, Dad, I'm rising, I'm rising. Rufus, are you ready to start our day? Rufus, are you awake? Whoa! Okay, who are you? It's me, Rufus. I've always wanted to try out this people fur. It's clingy, I like it. No, you can't be Rufus. What did you do with my dog? I'm a boy now. Wow, isn't this awesome?! Wait, I got an itch. Boy. Watch Movies And Series! There we go, okay. Ooh... ooh! All right, yeah, that's the sweet spot. Wait, a little bit, a little bit. There we go, okay. You can't be Rufus, you can't be. I would like a treat now! Was it that thing, the necklace? Is it magic? I would like one treat, please. And, man, I did say I wish you were a kid. Duck, chicken, jerky... I'm not that picky. You gotta give me that necklace. I have to turn you into a dog again. Whoa, no, no, no, hey, hey! What if I wanna be a boy? You can't be a boy. You're a dog. Hey, Manny. Dad. Hey, Dad. I'm up, I'm very up. So up. Stop goofing around with Rufus and let's get ready for school. Okay? Okay. Bye. I'm a boy again! Whoa. I got thumbs now. What am I gonna do with you? I can't leave you here... unless you give me that necklace. Whoa, whoa, whoa, hey, no, no, no! Hey, hey, hey, no, not until I've eaten pizza and learn how to play the piano and pee standing up. What am I gonna do? I can't take you to school. Why not? I mean, you wished for a friend you could take to school, right? Well, here I am, your best friend, right? So take me to school already. I guess I could pass you off as a normal kid. Would it work? Yeah, I'm very normal. Wait! Where... where... Where's my tail? Wait, wait, where's my tail? How... how will I know when I'm happy? I can give you the thumbs-up. Problem solved. These people furs are tight. Why do you guys wear these? If we don't wear pants, we end up in the people kennel. What? Here. These might fit you better. Catch. Later, Mom and Dad. Don't wanna be late on my second day. Love school. Bye. Yeah, later, Mom and Dad. Shh! Okay, we made it out okay. But if you're gonna be a normal boy, you gotta start acting like one. I can be normal, Manny. Hey, Larry! What's up? How's it going, man? Yeah... All right, all right, sniff you later. FYI, the generic kidney and trout you're feeding Larry is giving him gas. Um, good to know. Spend a buck. I'm sorry. That's what I'm talking about. Sorry, Larry. I've been watching you for years, Manny. Dog years... do you know how long that is? I can be normal... A squirrel, a squirrel! Squirrel! I want the squirrel, I'm gonna get you! Just get away, just get away! Dude, you're human now, get a grip. You don't get it, Manny. It's a squirrel. Buddy, I get it, okay, but why do dogs hate squirrels so much anyway? If only you knew the evil behind their bushy tails. The stories I could tell you. The things dogs have seen. This is gonna work but you gotta blend in. Okay, no chasing squirrels, just don't be weird. Okay? Rufus? You're not doing what I think you're doing, are you? What, aren't we going for a walk? This is what I always do when we go for a walk. Seriously? Did you not bring a bag? This is awkward. Your cousin. Yes, he's, visiting... from somewhere for, I don't know how long. You have cats, don't you? I smell cats, do you smell cats? Seems weird. But they don't pay me enough to care. Okay, Rufus, sit. I meant in a chair. I'm not allowed to sit on the furniture at home. Okay. Watch Movies And Series! So... What? We were talking about themes of transformation in Kafka's "Metamorphosis." You are hilarious, dog. Thanks but I'm not a dog. I'm a human boy. With squirrels, the key is to get it before it gets in the tree 'cause once they're in the tree, it's over. What's up? Well, see you later, Rufus. What's your name again? Manny. Right, Marty. Dude, your cousin is awesome. Catch you guys later. Okay, later. And it's Manny. Did I do good? Yeah, really good, Rufus. So we can play ball now? No. We've got more classes. More? Man... He's got a ball! Ball, ball, ball, ball... Here, boy! Squirrel! Squirrel! Hey, don't go behind that tree! I got you, I got you! It's just a squirrel. So you're telling me there's no sign of that amulet? I'm sorry, Mr. Black, but we've searched everywhere. I have devoted countless years to finding that amulet, unthinkable sums of money... I will not give up! Okay. But it's gonna take a miracle. Whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! Whoa! Sorry, sorry! My friend here has a real problem with squirrels. Hey. Hey, what's that? Rufus, wait! A miracle indeed. Dude, dude, you gotta rein that in, okay? Squirrels are not worth getting run over for. Squirrels are evil, Manny. They have big plans, terrible plans, plans humans couldn't even comprehend. Sure, okay, right, evil squirrels, whatever. Tell you what, I'm hungry. How about a snack, okay, your choice? Really? I love Power Puppy Kibble so much. Okay, whatever, if you want Power Puppy, I'll buy you Power Puppy. Sweet! Paige! Kittens! I love kittens! All dogs secretly do. The problem are cats. I hate cats. Quiet. Maybe she'll see us. Who? Paige. She's a girl from my school. I met her on my first day. So she's a friend. Not exactly. I mean, I'd like her to be but I'm afraid... Hey, Paige! What are you doing? Well, you said you wanted her to be your friend. Paige, over here! Hi, Paige. No, no, no, bad, Rufus. I'm Rufus. Hi. You go to my school, right? You're Manny's cousin. Right. I wanted to let you know that Manny's afraid to... Afraid I'm covered in kittens. So cute. Yeah, you think that... before they dig their claws in. So, what's the news at school? Any big scoops coming up? Page one is you two. From out of nowhere, you guys are the two most popular dudes in school. Okay, popular twins, catch you later. My goldfish gets grumpy when it's hungry. Later. You are the best wingman ever. I have no idea what you're talking about. I don't have wings. It just means if you look good, I look good. It's win-win. It means good. The point is you rock. The target is coming your way. We're ready. Thanks to you, I've got the town eating out of the palm of my hand. I love eating out of the palm of your hand. Know what we're doing today? Chase squirrels. Yes, we're gonna chase some squirrels. What a... What a great idea. I got this. Why am I the only one who wants to do that? I feel like... I feel like you don't get me. I smell garbage. Idiot. Manny, did you know about this? The dance. Yeah. They used my suggestion. They're going to the dogs. I guess Paige really sold it. Awesome! She's the best. You should ask Paige to the dance. I don't know. Maybe. Maybe? Manny? Manny? Where's Rufus? I haven't seen him. Why? He chewed my patent leather shoe. I can't even find the other one. That dog! Dude? You ate my mom's shoe so she still thinks we have a dog? Genius. Right, 'cause that's totally why I did that. You wanna know what else I did? I pooped behind the couch. Why wouldn't you ask Paige to the dance? She's really pretty. Yes, she is... Whatever. Hello. Manny Garcia. Hey, Paige. I was jus t talking about you with my... um, dog... yo. Yeah, dog, that's funny. What's up? Well, being the school's top newspaper reporter... okay, only newspaper reporter, I was wondering if I could score an exclusive interview with Taft's most interesting new student? I'm pretty sure I can arrange that. Awesome! Have Rufus meet me after school tomorrow on the quad. Wait, what? Rufus. I wanna interview Rufus. Right, Rufus. Popular guy, class clown. The big dog. Right! So you'll set it up? Yeah, I will. Awesome. Later. I mean... who would want to interview me? I'd interview you. You're almost out of popcorn. Me? Paige wants to interview me? Yes, you. Wow. Me? Yes, you. Are you mad about something? No. You sure? I'm not. You sound kinda mad. Like that time I chewed up your baseball glove. Okay, it's a little annoying that you... I got this. - I like to do things a lot. - Like play catch. Time to wrap things up. Idiot. Thanks for agreeing to do this interview, Rufus. Of course. I think newspapers are very important. You do? People need newspapers to do their business. I've been doing my business on them ever since I was a pup. Finally! Someone gets it. Yeah. So, Rufus, over night... you've become the most popular kid in school. How does that feel? Weird. Because you're the new kid? Because I'm new at being a kid. Ball! You are funny. Is that your secret to making friends? Sort of. I mean, when I see someone new, I kinda just bounce around them 'til they smile and then... boom... Instant friends. Works with everybody. Well, except cats. Dogged determination. I like that. Now, Rufus, the whole school wants to know, will you be taking a special someone to the dance? Well, Paige, turns out I've been meaning to talk to you about that very subject. So, guys, best in show, you know who to vote for. The big dog, am I right? Yeah. Hey. Yeah, let's go dance. A real human dance. So cool. Yeah, cool. I mean, there's music and friends and they're gonna announce best in show and... ooh, ooh... I'm pretty sure I know who it's gonna be. Congratulations in advance, Rufus. And the best part is my big surprise. Paige. Who told you? I'm gonna... go get some punch. Yo, dog, this is your song. This is my song. Come dance. Watch Movies And Series! Manny, did you see? I made a dance. It's amazing what you can do when your knees bend the other way. Being a human boy is even better than I ever dreamed. Yeah, awesome. I'm sure your date loves the dance too. Probably gonna write a front-page article about it. "Dog Dude Designs Dumb Dance." Manny? This move has been really hard for me, Rufus. Somehow you've made my terrible life even worse. And ever since you've put that necklace on, you've been... A bad dog? A bad friend. Hey there, Manny. Your date just left. Um, you're standing right in front of me. What are you talking about? Rufus is your date. News flash. You are my date. What? Rufus asked me out for you. Turns out I've been meaning to talk to you about that very subject. Will you go to the dance with... my best friend Manny? I would love to. Rufus did that for me? Yeah. He said you were too shy to do it yourself. Man. I think I just stepped in a big pile of... Manny Garcia and Paige Prescott, come on up! You're best in show of the dance! Whoo, that's right! Give it up for your royal couple! Yeah! Whoo! Now, don't you two look surprised. I thought it was gonna be Rufus. It was Rufus' idea. Yeah. You know who to vote for. The big dog, am I right? The big dog! And you guys know who the big dog is? That's right, my boy Manny. All right. But what about me? That was his idea too. And vote for Paige too 'cause Manny really likes her. So how does it feel to be king?! Right now, I don't feel like a king. I feel like a low-down dirty dog. Thank you, everyone... for this very kind and thoughtful honor. But... after the way I treated my friend, my best friend, there's... no way I can accept this. What? What? What? I also cannot accept. If you read my three-part series, "The Shameful Sham Of Class 102's Homeroom President," then you know I find these popularity contests objectifying and demeaning. On the other hand... tiaras are kind of cute. Rufus? Hey, Rufus. Manny. What's going on? Paige, I can't explain it to you. You'd never believe... me. Rufus is a dog. How could you possibly know that? A reporter's instinct. And he told me. And also... I'g.a do That would be D-O... A dog? Told me about the magic necklace, your wish and everything. Of course he did. Look, I owe Rufus a huge apology. Can you help me find him? You go that way, I'll go this way. We meet on the other side of the library. Thanks, Paige. Rufus, where are you, boy? Rufus? Hey, Linda, did you walk the dog? Nope, did you? No. I haven't seen him either. Maybe he's eating your wedding dress. It'll match your shoes. That's not funny. Rufus? Rufus? Rufus? Rufus... Rufus? Rufus? Rufus... Rufus? Rufus? Rufus? He's not here. We lost the dog. This move has been hard enough on Manny. If we lost his dog, he'll hate life forever. Remember when we had Rufus tagged with the GPS chip and you thought it was a waste of money? I may have been wrong on that one. He is at the school? Let's go! Give me the keys! You drive too slow! Rufus? Rufus, buddy... you there? Is that you? Look, I'm sorry I was being such a jerk. Rufus? You're not here for the dance, are you? Let's go! Hey, let me go! You're coming with us, kid. Where are you taking me? Help! Manny? Help, let me go! Let's go! Let me go! Help, please! What do you want?! Rufus? What's wrong? Manny's in trouble. Manny?! Manny?! Paige... those men just took my best friend but why would they... They're working for the squirrels, aren't they? No, Rufus. This is why. All right, I'll bite. What do you want with me? With you? Nothing. Nothing at all. Think about it. This magic thing, this amulet must have incredible power and be crazy valuable, so someone must be looking for it. Rufus, we gotta find Manny right away! I can do that! But not with this nose. Follow me. Rufus, wait for me! Where are you taking me? To a place your dear Rufus won't be able to resist. We've gotta find that dog. Manny will be crushed! Crushed! Get a grip! Do not go soft on me! Come on, Rufus, don't lose the scent. You can do this. Find Manny. Go, Rufus! I don't like the looks of this place. Ha. You drag me into a creepy warehouse in the middle of nowhere and think I'm gonna worry? My best friend will find me wherever you take me. We're counting on that. This is a trap and I'm the bait. Clever boy. But children should be seen... and not heard. I understand a certain K-9 with a very... I found him! I found him, Manny's in there. I smell my favorite snack. Power Puppy Kibble. My nose is never wrong. It must be in that huge barrel of dog food. Shh, Rufus. They took Manny knowing you'd come for him. They're expecting you and the amulet. I got an idea. Let's give them something they don't expect. Yeah. Eight years I've been hunting down that amulet... across six continents. But now I'm not pursuing it. It's being delivered to me on a silver platter. Or should I say a golden Labrador? Excuse me. Are you the owner and/or proprietor of this property? May I ask who's inquiring? Paige Prescott, ace reporter. My paper's doing a feature: "Wild Warehouses Of The Westside." Who lives here? Why live here? Could I get a quick comment? Unfortunately... we have no comment. Now, off you go, little girl. This can be a very unsafe place and we have work to do. You! Now, Rufus! There it is! Get that dog! Hey, you okay? I'm better now. Don't worry about it. I'll get the rest, you go find Rufus and let's get out of here. Here, Rufus! I think I hear him. It sounds like he's over here. You're not going anywhere until we find that dog. Stay. Or I'll make you stay. Hey... Hey, hey, hey! - Turn right here! - Okay, I'm turning, I'm turning! What is this place? Rufus? Rufus, come. Rufus, shake. Look, man, I'm sorry about what I said at the dance. I should've known you would never hurt me. Whatever I am, boy or dog, always remember, Manny... I just wanna be your friend. I... You do not lick my face. So have we kicked enough butt here? Violence as a means to resolve conflict. Children, what are they teaching you in school? Gym, math, his-history... I wish I could end this in a more civilized manner, but I want that amulet in the worst possible way. Now, who wants a doggy nap? Eeny... meeny... miny... boy! Manny! No! Now give me that amulet! Sorry to crush your dream. No. Rufus. No, you can't leave me. You gotta be okay. You're my best friend. My best friend. Dude? It didn't even hit you. Get up, you big baby. Rufus, you're okay. Come on, buddy. You're fine, Rufus. He may be okay but the amulet is done for. I guess Rufus is stuck being a dog. Not just any dog. My best friend. Rufus, is all right. What a relief. Rufus may be fine, but something else here sure isn't. Hello, police. Manny, are you all right, son? Yeah, I'm better, Dad. Better than ever. We barely escaped before the authorities arrived! If you let me live, I will do everything in my power to help you fulfill your master plan. You failed me for the last time. Idiot! Get it, boy, get it, boy, get it, boy! Get it, boy! Get the ball, get the ball. That is one happy hound. Yeah. So nobody legit will run your story? "The Crazy World Weekly" was very interested. "The New York Times," not so much. The story of a lifetime. Pulitzer Prize material. And no one believes a single word of it. If I hadn't lived it, I wouldn't believe it myself. There'll be other stories. You'll get your Pulitzer. Do you think he misses being a boy? Rufus said it himself. Boy or a dog, he just wants to be my friend. And, you know, who knows? Maybe he'll be a boy again someday. Stranger things have happened. Get it, boy, get the ball! Come on, come on, Rufus!
