Sisters do not speak out. Abo, are you sure the child was taken away? You sure it was Shomba that took her? It was. I saw her in the past few days with a limp. Problem walking. But I really heard Bian's voice here. You say Shomba is here now? This house looks so deserted. You don't have to be afraid that you won't see your mother again. It won't hurt. I'll be done before you know it. Don't come. - The children! My children! - Mama... Mama...! Don't touch my child! You! Don't come any closer! Stop! Get away from my child! You lunatic. Your children are burnt to death. Get down! I let you injure my child! Bian... my daughter... Hang her to death. Oh, Pithou. Why are you sitting here? Don't you want to watch your own work? I watched it once last night. You don't look happy. I can't watch Shomba's hanging cut scene. Hey, what's wrong? Well... Bian! Are you okay? What happened? She's here! She's here! Shomba's here! You don't have to be afraid. You just had a nightmare. Who's there? Are you there, Pithou? Pithou? Hey there Chen. This part's finished already. This isn't the beginning of next week's screening, is it? Where did you get the film? Well... I film movies that people like to see. What kind of horror film? I really want to see it. I don't know if I want to watch a ghost movie. Pooh. I know you're afraid and don't dare to watch. Well... of course not. I just... don't want to watch this silly thing. (Film Title: Evil Spirit 1-3) Are you ready? I haven't done it like this before. You put in the other film. Then put a reminder to send me the film to get. Peoll. Will we be okay? You hesitate now? If you want to ask for money, just say so in the first place. This is your take for these. I'll leave with these now. Hello? Asa, tonight I bought 3... of Series A. Well... I bought Cagliari. The AC Milan also has Palermo. Palermo. Barry is a cartoon devil. Oh, buy a thousand. Oh, three thousand. You want to... go back? Hello. Oh thanks. I didn't think you would remember my birthday. Goodbye. Happy Birthday, Som. Hey! Old lovers, is the former relationship still alive? What in the world are you doing, Chen? Peoll! Peoll! Chen! Peoll! - Peoll! - You okay, Peoll? That was painful. You okay? Sorry. Seems you girls went overboard. That was a pleasant surprise. I really didn't think my brother... would remember my birthday. I had forgotten that you still remember your husband. Hey! Cheers! Let's drink. Don't drink too much, Peoll. Don't you want to go to work tomorrow? Som, you are my sister not my mother. Drunk at this point. I'll be okay. I'd like to go back. Why? Where are you going? I might not wake up in the morning. You can. You're alone. So late, it's too dangerous to go home. You still live here with me now. Your dirty house, brother? It's like where dead people live. Super dirty and I had a chance to escape. You exaggerate. I'm going home. Bye. Go. Tonight... Nice weather, huh? - Looking back at the small things... - Forget it. Chen, you really are a coward. No wonder girls don't want you. Hey... Peoll. Are you sure security won't be up to check? You're kidding. I don't believe it. You don't need to keep pawning those wrist watches for money. Do it faster. (Lee's Pawn Brokers) (Amount for female watches: 4000 Baht) Chen, what's wrong? What are you doing with my watch? I just want to borrow it. You know that's not right? Only borrow it... I'll return it. Let go! Som. Who's there? What are you doing? I... I just came looking for something. Yesterday, when the movies were on here. Right, then you saw Peoll? I... I don't know. I just arrived. Where did he go? What do you want me to do when I see him? Ah, last night he gave the wrong film to the film maker. Now the film executive is looking anxious. They fear people will produce pirated discs. Where are you? Go get the thing at the entrance. OK. I'll go. Why did you lock the door? Oh, I was careless. Do you know last night's result? Each team won. You're working today in the afternoon, right? I have a favour to ask. Take the money. I need a part for something. Help me get it. - Then I'll go. - Okay. Don't forget. Peoll. Peoll. Peoll. Peoll. Peoll. Ah, shit! Hey, Chen. Where did your brother-in-law run off to? He's not answering my phone calls. I'm not sure. You two want to play me? What movie are you filming now? The cinema has a very strict inspection now. I'll find a way to get your money back. I don't want money. I want the film. I want it before the movie starts screening. Abo, are you sure the child was taken away? You sure it was Shomba that took her? But I really heard Bian's voice here. Bian. Bian. Daughter... (Calling Peoll) What happened, Abo? Run as soon as possible to bring your family. There was something fishy happening. Shomba turned into an evil spirit and is taking revenge. Now other people have died. Quickly, lead the children away. Bian. Bian. Bian. Bian. Bian. Peoll... Who's there? (Calling Som) (Stop calls) (Volume) Last night you were on duty, right? Yes. Did you see the films before you went home? I haven't seen them. Where did those films go? Which film was it? "Evil Spirit" I haven't seen them. You don't know where the film could be? Hey, Chen. Are you available? Help us put up some posters. After you two broke up... you stopped speaking to him? I don't have anything else to say to him. You know at that time, he was under the influence of medicine. He didn't intentionally want to hurt you. Be careful, the day love runs away is the day you know what pain is. (Based on true events) Why did you do this? Do you want to go to prison? Don't tell me you did this to make money to buy medicine. Peoll also knows about this, right? Where is he? Peoll... Your brother died, Som. What did you say? This may be hard to believe. But this film... It's not just a movie. There are real ghosts from this movie. Did you also take the film? I don't have it. Look at it yourself. Last night I screened the movie again. I saw Peoll's body in the movie. In this movie? Ever since I watched this movie... I see her everywhere. But you can't watch it... Why? What would happen? You going to hit me again? (Calling Peoll) (Evil Spirit) (Coming Soon) Chen, why are you sitting down here? I thought you went home. You told me to go get this for you. Take the time or you better not come back. Open up! Help! Hey! Chen! What happened Chen? Hey! Chen! Chen! Chen... What happened to him? I don't know what he was afraid of. But it looks really serious. What did he see this time? Was he on medication? Was he seeing things? Hey Som, after you and he parted... he stopped doing that. See you tomorrow 5AM. - Bye. - Bye. (Evil Spirit) (Evil Spirit team experienced strange event. Like electric lamp flickering.) (Team was told to burn incense for Buddhist ceremony.) (Publishing) (Shomba - Wikipedia) (Shomba... ) (Hanging) (Digging the eyes out) (Crazy woman catches children to dig out their eyeballs to frighten them) (Also remember this room, right!!!) (After an insane woman catches other people's children...) (she digs their eyes out at her home...) (to be her children.) (A few decades ago) (Shomba, a mad woman, took other people's children and had their eyes removed) (So they would think it's their homes) (When the villagers found out about this, they went to Shomba's home) (and they hung Shomba.) Thank you for staying. Thank you for worrying about me. Chen. You told me that thing. About Peoll's death. And ghosts in this movie. I don't know how to believe you. But... I found some information online. And the plot of the movie is exactly the same. When you saw the film... What is the ending of the movie? The outcome is... The protagonist dies. But without success. But... if we can succeed? Shomba's corpse might be hidden in this room. (Shomba has been tortured after hanging until now...) (No one found her body.) Chen. Chen. You see. How could this be? There should be a room. Chen, maybe not everything in this house is related to the film. Som! Chen! Chen! Are you injured? Chen! Can you hear me? Chen! Chen! Chen, I'll come back for you. Chen, are you alright? Are you injured? I'm okay. Let's go. Chen. Chen, climb up. What's wrong, Chen? What's wrong, Chen? Walk with me. You will come with me, Chen. Come on now. Chen. Chen. I said come on. Chen. Come on! Chen! Chen! It's me. Are you alright, Chen? It's me, Chen. I'm going to die like Peoll. I got your wrist watch back. But it broke when I fell. I think I'm too late to fix it. Chen, don't say that. You'll never... Mr. Chen to the Office, please. Only his left arm looks injured. I'll give you some medicine. The medication can be taken at home. One the other hand, what were you two doing in that room? Oh... We... We wanted information on how Shomba and her three children died. What did you say? Shomba didn't die. What happened in the end then? Shomba and her three children were hanged after execution by the villagers. The police rushed to the scene and quickly took Shomba to the hospital. However, the villagers believe that she and her three children had died. Dead things spread. That's Shomba. Wait a minute. Are you sure that old woman is Shomba? Yes, I'm sure. If Shomba didn't die... You see that... Who can it be? What if you're really seeing things? (Evil Spirit) Chen! Chen! Som. I always see that person. This person. Do you mean... The actor? Who are you looking for? It's been nearly a week and nobody has come for the mail. ("Evil Spirit" shooting team Contact List) (Screen 5: Villagers search for missing children - Behind the scenes highlights.) (Section 25: Shomba hanging dead - Behind the scenes highlights.) Sorry... (Shomba hanging) We're ready. Action! Cut! Action! Action! Help me! Help me! Take 25. Action! I'm dying. Help me. Cut! This is all bad. Jie. Why did you choose this actor? Eldest sister, your feet are not supposed to drop. Can you imagine? What are you afraid of? Do you know the wrong lines? Do you know how to dance like you are going to die? Please concentrate. Action! Cut! Can you act like you're dying? Action! Cut! Elder sister, where are you having difficulties? Can you let me try again, please? Once again, if you're changing clothes, it's not enough time for me to go home. What are you afraid of? I really don't understand. What's the risk? It's very good security, Sister. You tried it several times during practice. Several times you tried it! Everybody's waiting on you! Just shoot! Get ready to go again. Give me a good speech. Let's shoot another! Help me... Jie! Jie! Look quickly. Look quickly. The rope broke. Stop! The safety rope broke! The safety rope broke! Down. Fast! Fast! Kaka! Down fast! Come and help. Sorry... Chen. Chen. Where are you going? Som. If I don't come back tomorrow... don't go to the cinema. Don't watch that film, Som! Why? Shomba's film scene where she and her three children died... is true. The actress is really dead. Those who have watched this scene... will die. What are you going to do? Where are you going? Chen. Chen... Sorry, Som. Chen! Chen! Chen! Hey, Chen. It's been a while. Where are you rushing off to? I waited several days for you. You want to play me? There you are. Hey, Chen. It's been a while. Where are you rushing off to? I waited several days for you. You want to play me? Hey, Chen. It's been a while. Where are you rushing off to? I waited several days for you. You want to play me? Bastard! Som. Som! Som! Chen! Chen! Chen! Som. Som! Som. You want to see me die!? Want to see me die, right!? Look! Watch me die! Want to see me die, right!? Want to see it...! Chen! Chen! Peoll... Chen... Chen! Chen! Chen! (Evil Spirit) (Now showing) Buy film screenings. Now open. Want to see me die, right!?
