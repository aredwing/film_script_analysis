It's gonna be all right. What was she doing in the forest? Henry and maud are coming. They're close. They think she's afraid of the house, That she jumped out of the window to escape. Neve, do you hear? Your parents are coming. Oh, god, lucas, look at her mouth! Jesus christ! Shh, neve, neve.. Neve.. Shit. Her tongue has been cut. Looks like a bite. Who did this to you? Was it the dog? neve.. Neve, what happened? ryan and lucy, go back upstairs, now! she's covered in scratches and bruises. She must have fallen, Either with the dog or earlier. Oh my god. What's all this blood? Oh, god.. Who did this to you? Did someone break in to the house? Why did you jump? You could have killed yourself. Okay, let's go, now. come on, come on. It wasn't me! It wasn't me, daddy! Okay, let's go upstairs. Mommy's upset, let's go. Shh. Shh, shh.. Who is that? Do you know them? Hi. Come in. Maud, neve, come downstairs. Look who's here! sit down. Would you like some tea? Yes, please. please. How are you? Not too shaken up? She looked so terrified. That wound.. I don't know what to think. I'm gonna ask advice from a friend in galway, Who's a shrink. Hiya, neve. How you feeling? We came to see how you are. Say hello, neve. You've got to exercise your tongue. hello. Are you all right? Two years is not long enough. I'm sorry we couldn't be there. I know mary loved henry. He was her favorite doctor. I just hope she soon settles into the house. A shelf fell down yesterday. It was my fault, I didn't put it up properly, but.. She thinks things move. The house creaks, it's normal. She's forgotten what it's like living in the country. But, if she doesn't settle, then we'll have to move. Even if it means going back into town. After only one month now, it's a bit of shame, But, still.. And we're gonna have to do her bedroom up again. Let her choose everything this time. Maybe she'll feel better then. And I've cut the branches down outside her window. They were casting shadows over the wall. We had to do that, too, for our kids. They were scared stiff by them. And leave a night light on for her. Oh, we bought one of those this morning. Do you not miss living in town? With your high class patients? No, I'm fed up with all that. Besides, the country's better for the kids. That's enough, neve. Leave him alone. How many times have we told you, dammit! I'm sorry. Neve is still very jealous of her brother. But children don't always realize how violent they can be. You're still a little tired, sweetheart. Go upstairs and have a rest, and I'll come up and see you. Nat? You okay? Yeah, I just.. I have this ringing in my ears. Hmm? It's it's okay. It's gone now. Come on, let's hurry up. The kids are waiting on us. Shh. Don't be afraid. Everything's all right. Trust us. Can you give mummy a smile? A good night kiss? Mummy.. Daddy.. What's that noise? Who was that screaming? Neve! What are you doing? Bring your brother back here, now! Neve! [crashing, slicing sounds Neve, protect your brother! Go downstairs! Downstairs! Go! Aargh! Brooke! ..No sign of them. ..To control.. We have recovered two adults, We're still missing two children. Over. check around the back. there's something here. come here. Come here. No! Aaah! Ciaran.. Ciaran! No! Ciaran! Ciaran! Let go of me! What's wrong with him? it's okay, it's okay. My little brother! Neve.. Neve, it's me. It's joseph. Neve! Ciaran! His ribs were compressed too tight for too long. He suffocated to death. That wasn't the smoke. The cupboard protected them. She was squeezing him so hard, could she.. Have..? Maybe, but.. I don't think she would have had the strength. She's saying that the house went crazy. I mean, even if she doesn't remember the attackers, We're gonna try and keep her here During the investigation. I'm not sure where, exactly. And it's going to take time to find her a foster home. We can take her. Yes, of course. Of course. It might take a while. It would be better for her To start back at school at start of term, So she doesn't fall behind. We can keep her for as long as she needs. We have a spare room. Well, okay then. Just the time being. It'll help me out. It's very kind of you. If there's anything you notice, you let us know. I better go. I didn't have her medical records. I suppose her father looked after her. All those marks and scars.. She had a bad accident When she lived here when she was little. She was a bit of a daredevil. She must not have changed. Last week, she cut her tongue escaping her house. Last night, was she.. Was she hit or abused in any way? I'm not allowed to tell you. She's had a shock, so.. Don't be surprised if she's withdrawn or difficult. don't cry. Not in front of her. oh.. Nat? Okay. It's okay. I'll be all right. It's okay. Neve? Neve? No.. No! be careful! I'm tanya. I'm the welfare officer from school. I'm here to help you. She's only here for the time it takes To find the best possible solution for her. Don't go overboard, or get too attached. I'm just saying it for your sake. You okay? Do you like your new room? Another girl.. Another girl used to live here, but.. ..She left. Well, we we can talk about that another time. Did you try any of your new clothes on? Do you wanna go and buy some more? Do you want to have a quick wash? No. Okay, well.. ..That doesn't matter. Dinner will be ready in about an hour, If you want to go outside for a breath of fresh air. What are you doing? Nothing. Just looking out the window. Do you want a glass of water? Can't you sleep? I don't know. Tell me if you're too hot, or you're too cold, Or you need, ah, thinner blankets. if you're frightened, You can come in and sleep with us. Or I can come in and sleep here with you, If you prefer. Okay. Good night, then. It was a long war. They didn't fight like we do nowadays. Look at those weapons. What do you call that long blade with the handle? See the soldier standing up In the center of the picture? Don't worry, neve. You've only missed the first few days. You'll soon catch up. Shush. I haven't heard the bell yet. It's a sword. A sword. Okay? Turn to the next page.. morons, you stink! Morons. Eww! I thought it might be nice If we ate lunch together from time to time. Just the two of us. What do you think? And what about the other children? Are they nice? I don't know. And is everything going okay with nat and lucas? And ryan and lucy, do you get on? Oh, you're still very sad. That's normal. Do you want to talk about your parents And your brother? Not necessarily about what happened. We can talk about before. Your own memories. Did I tell you about the day I ate all the caviar My parents had put aside for an important dinner? Do you know what caviar is? Ow! Neve. Are you okay, sweetheart? Is something the matter? Tell me. They're silly, aren't they? When I'm finished with these two, I'll give you a bath, okay? But not with them, Because you're a big girl now. Is is lucas home yet? That's enough, you two. Come on, now. You know, neve, you really must have a wash. I've left towels and soap in your room, But you haven't touched them. It's been too long now, really. It can't go on like this. It can't. I I'll help you. Okay. Head back so it doesn't sting your eyes. Your'e it! You be it. Come on, kids. Come on, stop fooling around, you need to get dressed now. Lucy, you.. Ryan! he didn't touch me! Neve? Neve? What is going on? I can't have this. I'm sorry, neve. This is ridiculous. Come on, get up. Stand up. Neve.. No! Come on. Neve, the water is not clean. It's already been used, and it's cold. You'll feel better afterwards, you'll see. Now, now.. Turn around. Let me help you. Don't be scared. That's the way to do it. You remember, don't you. Oh! Hurt myself with that damn.. Sorry. No.. No! It's okay, it's just a draft. Just some clothes on the floor. Everything's fine, okay? There's nothing to be scared of. Trust me. They've nothing. Nothing whatsoever, not even a lead. I know you spoke to joseph today, neve, Down at the police station. He came to school. He wants to punish those bad people Who did all that nasty stuff at your house. So that's why he's persevering. You do understand? And also, so it doesn't happen again. I've already said it. It's the house. We can call your father's sister later. The one who lives in the states. Wouldn't you like to see her, or speak to her? It's my belt. One of the trouser loops is broken, And the belt keeps rising up. It itches. Someone at school thought you were my sister, That you'd come back. Ryan! My dead sister mary. You were friends when you were little. Your daddy was her doctor. She had cancer. Fee, fie, foe, fum! Finished, finished, finished, finished! Lucy, please. Hey, give that back! Give it back! Hey! That's enough. If you're not back at the table By the time I've counted to ten, you're going straight to bed. One.. Two.. Nat, we're all out of beer. Three.. Four.. I'll get some. Ryan and lucy, come help me pick a bottle. Yaay! The cellar! The cellar! I'm not scared. You're a scaredy cat. No, you are. No, I'm not. You are. Ryan, no running. We used to have another little girl, but, em.. ..She died. We didn't say anything, Because it happened a long time ago. That's all. And we didn't want it to upset you. Ryan, just I'm gonna switch the light back on. Did you knock it over? That doesn't matter, don't cry. Neve? Oh! Nat? Nat?! Stay where you are! You have to.. Nat! You okay?! Are you hurt? daddy.. Daddy! What happened here? Daddy! Daddy! daddy.. Are you hurt, ryan? No. Shh, shh. Neve? Oh, neve.. What..? Neve! Leave her alone, okay? I'll put these two to bed, And then I'll I'll be right back, okay? Sorry. Let's throw everything away that could harm anyone, And we'll sort out the rest tomorrow, okay? Nat, this is impossible. Have you seen what she's done? It's not the same for ryan and lucy. They were bumping into everything. And scared. They hurt themselves. But her.. Why did she.. I don't know, lucas. Don't you think she got scared by all the screaming And the noises in the cellar? Maybe it reminded her of that night. I went into her room just now, and she was so scared, As if I was gonna.. You've got to speak with tanya straight away. This is not normal! Lucas.. We can't give up on her At the first problem we encounter. She is traumatized. We'll see tomorrow, okay? Okay. no, please! Aah! What the hell are you doing there? Go home! Didn't you hear me? Get outta here. Get lost! Are you coming outside with me? Help us, please. Help us. Please. please.. Mommy! Shut up! No. No! What's going on? Who's doing that? Make it stop. Make it stop! Make it stop! I'm not doing anything, mummy! What is it? What is it?! peter.. Peter! Let her go, mummy! Please, I'm begging you! Neve! Neve. Neve, can you hear me? Jenny will pick the little ones up From school, don't worry about that. Neve says she hasn't seen peter or emily. They've disappeared. Couldn't get anything out of her. It's just a coincidence. I'm not sure. There are fingerprints of several children All over the house, and neve's are amongst them. It doesn't prove anything. She could have left them there anytime. What? What do you think neve has done? You think she murdered an entire family? Nobody's saying that, nat. But the circumstances Surrounding both murder scenes Are very similar. And she ran away from your house Just when it was happening. So? She can't even remember who killed her parents. I don't know, that's what she says. Children are very easily influenced. And these people, these.. ..Murderers.. Maybe she knows them. Or maybe she's listening to what they tell her. I just.. I I don't know. What? Lucas.. Say something! Maybe it's best just to keep her out of the way for a while. Everyone knows everyone's business around here. People are superstitious. They're gonna start imagining things. No, she must go back to school as normal. You must tell people to stop talking rubbish. And I'll do the same. She'll never get over this if nobody helps her. What about your daughter? She's the same age as neve, isn't she? And she has a birthday party next week, You should invite neve. It would suit you to keep her cooped up here, But henry helped your little girl when she was tiny. People protect themselves. They protect their kids. That's all. No one's going to leave you in the lurch, nat, okay? I'll come by tomorrow. But I'm asking you to do one thing. Keep an eye on her. She mustn't go out alone, or sleep by herself. We can't find her wandering the streets. how many different species Can you name from memory? ..According to the estimated figures, Between five and a hundred million different species Inhabit our planet. Are you all right? Yes. Neve.. Aren't you coming outside? Yes. why is she here? It's her.. ..The murderer. She killed 'em. Killed her family, and peter and emily's mum. Hey! What's going on here? Come on, break it up. Break it up. What are you doing? Why are you being so mean? Lucy! Come on, come on. Stop being so nasty. Neve, wait. Neve! Back, back. Come on, go play. Come here, come here. You're having your birthday party, I want you to invite her at the weekend, okay? No, mummy, please no. Yes, darling, come on. it's okay. But I have to go and check on neve, She's in there on her own, okay? She's got nobody, and you've got me and you've got daddy, okay? Okay. Okay? Okay. Now, go on. Be good. Neve. Shall we go back to the classroom? Well, then.. I'm having a birthday party on Saturday. You can come. My mum will explain. Let's stay concentrated, please. Got to get out. Sit back down, neve. It'll soon be break time, and I'll come down to you. Got to get out of here! Neve.. Come on, come with me. What's the matter? Come on, we'll ask someone to bring us two lunch trays, And we can eat in the office. Just the two of us, okay? Are you okay? It's it's me. I'm I'm the one who does all that. I make objects move when I cry. I made I made them kill my parents. Peter and emily's mother. Neve, what are you going on about? No one can do that. It's not your fault if bad things happen. Come on. Let's go eat. And how is everything going in nat and lucas's? Are they nice to you? They keep talking to me. Hugging me, smiling at me. And don't you like smiles? A smile is kind, isn't it? Well, you're right, it depends. But you can usually tell if someone's smile Is kind or nasty, can't you? I heard you'd been invited To anne's birthday party on Saturday. That's great. I bet you will have lots of fun. I used to have little parties when I was young. Well, I already told you about the one with the big dog. But there were others. You want to touch it? Hey. You already know each other, don't you? But maybe you don't know That matthew collins is my baby's daddy. Well, there are a lot of unanswered questions here. She was assaulted that night the first murders took place. Maybe by that gang. Ah, I don't know. I'm wondering if it doesn't go further back.. ..If it's not her parents that abused her that night.. ..And even before. She's got all the symptoms of an abused child. And look at peter and emily's mother.. it's a strange coincidence. Try to think about something else for a while. For our sakes, and the baby's. I'll come and pick you up after school. Okay? I better get gone. See you later. how was school today? They told us about peter and emily, And their mother. They said we must always stay together, And tell someone if we see a stranger. We mustn't go into the forest. Don't' worry, sweetheart, it won't be for too long. Here. You haven't had too many sweeties today. Here. I'm gonna read you a story, and then it's bedtime. story about murders? I think not, sweetheart. Would you like anything else? I'm going to my room to read. Oh, neve.. Stop pushing me away. We'll never get on If you keep on treating us like your enemy. Neve, my sweet little kitten.. You can read downstairs, with us. I know it seems like a nightmare, But one day it'll be better, you'll see. Trust us. Stop it, neve, please! You're gonna wake up ryan and lucy. It's just for tonight, we can't let you sleep on your own. Wandering around the countryside Alone at night like that is dangerous. shh. Aaah! Aaah! Neve, stop it. That's enough now. Stop screaming. Neve, please, neve. Stop it! Neve.. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, sweetheart. I just wanted you to stop screaming, And come to bed, I.. I just wanted you to be a good girl. No, no no. No, neve, what are you doing? Nat.. She'll sleep in her room, but I'll stay with her. It's just for one night. Can block up her window tomorrow. Come along, neve. Go to sleep, please. It's late. What the hell are you doing?! Who gave you these? I got them from the album downstairs. I like them. What gives you the right? Who do you think you are?! These are ours, they're not yours! I forbid you to touch them! Lucas, have you gone crazy? She took those, she was playing with them. daddy! You go to them, I'll stay here. Daddy! Neve, why would you take these? This is our little girl, mary. The one who got sick, do you remember her? Why would you show them to lucas? It hurts us, we we loved her so much. Then why is she dead? But neve.. That wasn't our fault. She was seriously ill. There was nothing we could do. And that had nothing to do with her being ill. Try and get some sleep now. mary.. Mary.. Mary.. Hi, my name is olivia. Welcome. Neve, the other children are in the garden. Join them. Look. She's the prettiest doll in the shop. Do you like her? Anne loves dolly parties. Have you heard of them before? No. I I want to go home. I don't want it. Ah, we we can't go home now, sweetheart. That wouldn't be very nice for anne. Anyway, I'm sure you'll play lots of other things, And there'll be cake, and presents, and.. I think colette has even organized a treasure hunt. I'll be right here, okay? Hello. hi! Are you coming to play? Have fun and be careful. Give me a shout when you're hungry. ..So disgusting. Don't do it again. They sound like they're having fun. Yeah, it was a good idea of yours. I'm so glad she came. hi, what's your name? ..Mentally sick people.. Are you feeling okay? Do you want a glass of coke? Can I see your doll? She's lovely. I don't like the dress. It's pink. It should be blue. On second though, she's not very lovely. Is she bold? Do you have to punish her? Mine's crazy, I have to look out. Awake, asleep. Awake, asleep. She's ugly and fat. Ooh.. It's not your ear again, is it? You really must see gwendoline. I'm sure it's tinnitus. I've got her number, I'll go get it for you. Thank you. Hang on a sec. oh! Neve! Get away from there, neve! Neve, come here! Colette! No.. Neve, don't! Be careful! Get in the kitchen! Go on! Neve! Go, what are you doing?! Go, quickly, move! Neve! Neve? Neve? Yes, I'm fine. I'm out looking for her. No, I want to be the one to find her. Are they hurt? Well, they're talking a load of rubbish. Well, we left lit candles on the table. It's our own fault. What do you think neve is actually capable of? Well, what else could it have been? No, I don't want to call lucas. I want to find her myself. He's looking after the other two. Neve? Neve? Who's there? Who is that? Neve.. You frightened me. Neve. neve.. Who's screaming like that? don't be afraid. Neve. Neve? Where are you? What's going on? Neve, please say something. What.. What did they do to you and your brother? Neve, help me. I've hurt myself. Lucas.. I'm in henry and maud's house. Neve.. Neve, give me my phone back. What's going on here, neve? What the hell are you doing? Answer me. Answer me, neve. Answer me! Gently. Don't be afraid. Let me do it. See? It isn't hot. You're tired. You're hungry. But be good children. Mommy and daddy are tired, too. Arrgh! Aah! You talked to the children About what they said at school? Not yet. They'll have to be punished. They don't realize everything we do for them. Back then.. ..People didn't used to get involved in education. Nowadays, everybody has their own opinion. are you giving me a goodnight kiss? subtitled by SELVAHEMA
