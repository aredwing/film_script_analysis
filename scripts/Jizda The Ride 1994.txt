I can give you a good price.|What's your offer? We haven't got much. How much? Eight. - Eight what?|- Thousand. Eight thousand crowns? Let's look there, then. Take a good look at this one.|It's a Pontiac. This is what the one over|there could look like. When you put it together. Eight thousand crowns. A '93|model, ABS, air conditioning. - Where's the engine?|- In the shed. But it's registered|and has number plates. But we want to drive it tomorrow. Well guys, you should have|put more away. Sorry. We've fucked! Is there anything here that|we could drive away? This Kadet's not too bad. They can all run. Back there we've|engines, wheels... no problem. Just needs a simple fix-up. - But we want to hit the road now.|- Let's take a look over there. - But none of them are registered.|- Let me worry about the papers. Plates too.|I like you guys, you go far. I'm going to give you choice.|French plates. Just say "Bonjour ". Works a treat|to the cops if they stop you... They're stupid.|They'll let you go. German doesn't work anymore.|"Guten Tag " they know... - So, French plates are better.|- I won't be driving it... Doesn't matter who's driving.|It's just a better cover. - So how much?|- How much d'you have? - Eight thousand.|- Eight? You're kidding me. I should chuck|this in and do charity work. So it's a deal? THE RIDE /We'll find a place /where the smoking's good. /Where the hot sun /doesn't sting the drinks. /Where the wind spreads|/bits of bird shit /all around us and says /We've got to try|/what tastes the best /and calmly wait|/till someone comes. /Someone who knows|/that we're sitting here, /and who will say "hi, boys". /I've got one long arm. /One long arm for you. /Come sit with us /we'll listen to you. /We'll think on what /we've got to do. /Give us your hand /and you'll relax... /on that spot|/where one feels blue. Bonjourrr... The main roads are|for cops and criminals. The side roads are for us. Haven't we been here before? The Prague Health Dept.|issued a warning... ...about the poor quality|of water in swimming pools. This is due|to people peeing in the water. And, quote: "Everyone's peeing ",|say City health officials. It says that a shrew is around one and a half times|the length of a credit card. That's a progress. We used to use match boxes to compare the scale of things. God for instance. Let's check this scale. - So what's the verdict?|- God is great! Let's plug ourselves|into the world. A Roumanian girl would be ideal. - What for?|- We could share her both. - They're good, eh?|- No, but if she didn't like it, she couldn't complain,|nobody would understand her. And we could say that we|thought she wanted to, right? Or a Hungarian. For sure. - Aren't they all ugly?|- We can't be too choosy. Or we can pick up a real|beauty, have her in the woods... But then we'd have to bury her. We got a shovel. A tropical heat wave has|paralyzed traffic in the capital. Traffic on most major routes|is gridlocked and not moving. Seems as if it never will. Good afternoon. - C'mon. We'll give you a ride.|- Oh no, boys, it's not worth it. - I live here in this village.|- C'mon. Here. But it's really not worth it. - Your rake...|- See, with my rake. Such a nice car.|I'll only scratch it up. You'll sit up front... - Here we go.|- Where are coming from? Oh, the fields.|Working, you know. Raking hay. - You still rake hay?|- Sure. - And where do you come from?|- We're from Prague. I hope you find some nice|ladies and enjoy your holiday. - Stop right here, by this lady.|- Here? I told you, it's not worth it... Now can I have my rake.|Thank you. Where were you...|... that you needed a lift. They were just nice boys...|from Prague. Even then we only gave|her a short lift. It was still a good deed! If we hadn't taken her,|we'd be three miles further. But it's not true.|It's impossible. So we're actually three miles|behind, you see... So, whatever happens from now on|wasn't meant to be. A magic moment.|What's up? Where you going? The reward for our good deed. Hi. Want a ride? What are you doing here?|C'mon. Get in. You'll die here.|Ants will eat you alive. - What were you doing there?|- Nothing. So what were you leaving behind? Panties. Where to? Doesn't matter.|I'll get off somewhere. - We can take you home...|- No. Did something happen to you? I'd like a drink. Can be arranged. What's he doing? Arshole. - Do you speak English?|- Czech. You didn't see a redhead|somewhere around here? - No.|- No, we haven't. What do you want to drink, then? Gin. No ice. And tonic. - There's no gin.|- Doesn't matter. What? She says it doesn't matter. What? - It doesn't matter.|- Fernet, then. - So what does she want?|- Fernet. What's this place called? Where are you going? South. The sea? The car hasn't any papers,|so it can't cross the border. So what do you do|when you get to the border? We'll go either east or west. - Going through Pelhrimov?|- No. But we can take you there|if you want. What I really want is a drink. Who was that in the car? A guy. Did he do something to you? No. What did she say? Nothing.|I think she's a bit wacky. Well then work on her.|She could... Did you notice that she hasn't|put those panties on yet? That means that under that skirt,|she's actually, you know... I guess so. And probably|doesn't even know it. You think she's, like,|nuts or something? I don't know. Well, no point in us|fighting over her. Look, she's put them back. So she's not totally nuts. So we won't get to see|her little pussy after all. Hey look. A mirage. That's where I'd like to go.|Just disappear. It's the heat.|We say the air is sweating. - Have you got any money?|- Money? Why do you want to know?|Do you? I don't have any. So you'll|have to look after me now. Aha...? That's why I'd like to know|if you have any money. Why? Do you want it or what? - No...|- So I don't get it. Well, if I want something... And do you want anything? I'd like an ice-cream. A Magnum. D'you want to sit up front? C'mon. So will you tell me your name? Why? Does it matter? I'll be|getting off soon anyway. Where are you getting out?|In Nepomuk? So why don't you come with us|to Susice at least, eh? - What do you think you're doing?|- I should be asking you that. Our contract states that this|fridge is property of Algida. You can't put other stuff|in here. Pragolaktos, Scholler. I'm surprised you don't keep|chicken and spinach in here too. So it's Annie? I'm Radek. Hi. - Cute little knuckles.|- Don't say that. Why not? I want to... It's just talk. Isn't it? I don't have another freezer. Freezers should be provided by|those companies that supply you. I am hereby disconnecting|and sealing ours. So what should I say|to make you stay with us? Am I going anywhere? - Well, no. Not yet you aren't.|- So don't say anything yet. Do I annoy you? No. It's just...|I don't want to talk now. Will you require|a receipt for these samples? That way I could record how much|of the other stuff there was. - Well then don't bother.|- Alright then. One more Magnum. See you. - It's freezing me!|- So put it on the floor. No! It's mine. Mine! Oh, shit! /Come here, little mouse,|/come to me!! /No I won't, little cat,|/you'd eat me. /Yes you will, yes you will,|/you know it, too. /Dog!! Kill the cat!!|/Kill the cat!! /I want to look,|/want to look at it. /I want to look as it|/squeals under your paws. /And if it survives,|/if it survives... /... I'll tie you up, and let|/the cat scratch out your eyes. /And then I'll wrap myself up|/in barbed wire and plug it... /... into a socket and|/release the devil. I get the feeling he really|wants to see you again. Poor guy.|He must be really mad. Why are you running|away from him? I don't like him anymore.|I don't want him. So why are you going|with him, then? He does whatever he wants...|... with me. So we'll teach him|a lesson, right? Do you have a gun? No, we don't. Unless|there's one in the trunk. Does he have one? No. But he might have got one. That would be just like him:|he's really aggressive. He once kicked the shit out|of a guy... ...just because|he was talking to me. Beat him to a pulp. Is he really such a tough guy? Are you that afraid of him? I messed up my dress. Totally. That can be washed. I don't have anything to change|into. It's all in his car. - So what do you think?|- Why do you ask? You want her. Well, if you want to know,|I am not having fun. Since we picked her up we've|hardly spoken to each other. We're wasting our time|running away from some arshole. - At least something's happening.|- She's only got that one dress. And I bet she's used|to a lot of money. I bet she'd expect a hotel. You think she's going to stay|with us overnight? She'll smoke all of our grass and|then we'll never get rid of her. - That wouldn't bother me at all.|- I don't mind either. But for God's sake,|go screw her. Just look at you. - Now? In broad daylight? No.|- I'll swimm the other way. Hey, come on... don't. - I'll turn around if you're shy.|- I'm not shy. If I were a guy,|I couldn't bear it. What? The way it shrinks|like that in the water. It must be awfully humiliating? It's normal.|Happens to everyone. - Let's go for a walk somewhere.|- Where's the other guy? Over there, on the other side.|He wants to be alone. So, what's the story|with the panties? Well,|I was being a bit naughty. Can you believe|I had to take them off... ...and throw them away just because|someone else gave them to me. - Would that upset you too?|- Who'd you get them from? - I don't know. My Mum, I guess.|- Oh, from your Mum! Don't. Not here. Why not? - I can't make love.|- Why can't you? Because I'm not turned on. So tell me what to do|to turn you on. But I don't want|to be turned on. Well. That's different. Maybe we'll make love.|But not here and not now. We're free-wheeling. - Can I take the keys out?|- No! The steering wheel would lock.|And that curve would finish us. Why do we have to follow|the road all the time? Such a nice hill...|Why can't we just go straight? We can do anything we want.|We can go straight. OK. We're going straight. Take off your glasses. Well, kids: it's been great.|Good bye. Bye. Ciao. Too bad we didn't get to know|each other better. - But I'm afraid.|- Too late. It's locked now. Hang on. We going to die? Mummy! I think I bit my tongue. Oh, blood. When I look up at the sky, I see these two little|bubbles or more like spots. Where? Only I can see them.|They're in my eye somewhere. And they just go sailing|through the sky... When I don't look at them, they go where I'm looking. But when I try to look at them, then they go off somewhere|on their own. So I pretend not to look at them,|and then they come back to me. And so I keep chasing them|through the sky. With me, it's a little line. I haven't seen it for a long|time, but it's still there. Is there a moral in all this? Don't know. It's actually the first|video game in the world. Can you hear that? - In the air. Not on the ground.|- I know. Smells nice, like those|air fresheners in washrooms. I don't smell anything. I can't smell anything. They're in a hurry, eh? A cable car. Take it down. Hey Ferda! Get Mary.|Wait, I'll get Mary. I'm coming!|I've brought the broomsticks! We're going|to clean it up here. Get Betty; Betty will help you. I'm the only female around. And what are you going to do|if we all jump you? You don't have what it takes. Careful I don't bite you. Mary. I'll behave myself. So don't|make me do it with everyone. We'll see about that. Said Ferda. Where is she? Over there. - Where's she going?|- I don't know. - She's leaving!|- No she's not. - She is! She's leaving us here.|- So let her go. But she's got my t-shirt. Wait, my t-shirt. Hey mister! Don't take her! Why did she do that?|She had a great time with us. What a bitch! - So you didn't get any?|- Of course not. - She left her dress here.|- She doesn't care. And we're up shit creek. Guess what? It's cracked. Great. So we're not fucking|going anywhere, are we? - Nope. Not likely.|- Fuck... - Hey Radek, you got a fetish?|- Bull. It's been washed. Look, a tractor! It's a work of art. It's actually quite beautiful. It's even signed. Armabeton. Do you think|the pyramids are higher? These have got to be higher. Let's compare it to our matchbox. Where's the steam?|Don't they work? A work of art|isn't supposed to work. It provokes|an emotional response. They're telling us: "Save,|energy, or we'll turn on." /An actress at the Comedie|/told me /she'd take me away|/to Nowhereland. /To Nowhereland... Shit! It stinks. I'm going to dry my dress. /The clouds fly|/low above the ground. /Fly fast, my head is spinning. T/he clouds fly|/low above the ground... /For the last time|/I envy the clouds... /... the way that they can see|/the world. /The clouds fly|/low above the ground... /One day she'll take me away... /far away... No one's in control! What would you do, what would you do if you had|only one year to live? Depends on what you mean. Well, would you drop everything|and just live it up... Or would you try|to leave something behind? What's the point of|leaving something behind? One should leave|something behind. Kids, at least. So Frank, you can die in peace. - You're a dad?|- Yeah. - You're married?|- Yeah. - And it's enough for you?|- Totally. But in any event,|I don't want to die. - And are you married?|- No way. So you can do what you like... - You could say that.|- So what do you do? I've a girlfriend... That's enough for you? - Two hundred.|- Each? - Per room.|- I'm sleeping in the car. That's five Jim Beam's.|Hope she's worth it. At least|she didn't steal anything. Where did she go? No money; nothing; at night. She won't get lost. She's gone.|I think she's really gone. I should have gone with her|to the shower. It was an invitation.|I should've gone up with her. If only I didn't have that drink,|it would've been okay. - I think it's fate or something.|- What? That this particular girl|was on the road... Jesus, if she's your fate,|then God help you. What do I know? - You really didn't like her?|- No. Pretty girl. Just forget her. Such a cute smile. Nice red hair. She had that|cute peachfuzz all over her... Get some sleep. All because of one drink... One drink less, and she'd still be here. No need to wash. No. Then night. - I brought breakfast.|- Hey, hi. - What's this cat doing here?|- Sleeping. Look what I did. Here. - God, what happened?|- A wire with little thorns... - It's called barbed wire.|- Where were you? - Somewhere.|- All night? And the wire was rusty. So now|I've got blood poisoning, right? No you haven't.|You've been vaccinated. "We're " vaccinated against tooth, mouth,|shedding and worms. We've a dog. A German|Shepherd. He's really neurotic. We always have to pay attention|to him, otherwise he bites. Once I was playing with Johnny. - The dog?|- No, the guy. The one who's chasing us? And I had him tied to the bed|by his hands and feet. And we were playing around. And when it grew hard,|I brought in the dog. When the dog came up to him|he wanted to be petted. He couldn't move or even shout|because that'd upset the dog. He just lay there.|He couldn't do anything. And I stood behind the door|and watched him sweat in fear. "Throwing rocks into the river|and on the slopes is forbidden." "Irresponsible behaviour can lead|to serious injury to persons..." "... in the afore-mentioned areas."|The International City Council. Why don't you have|the dog put down? - But we love him. He's ours.|- So how did it turn out? - Did he bite it off?|- No. He just sniffed it. I sure wouldn't|let you tie me up. But we haven't known each|other long enough. Would they shoot at us|if he isn't armed? It's true they only shoot|ones who're armed? - How do you know he isn't?|- I didn't see a gun. Smile. It's the cops. They're coming back. BANK - OK?|- Not bad. When I do something I shouldn't, I feel like everyone's|watching me. That's because they are.|We should get out of here. I need to pee. - Are you scared?|- You don't want to? Not at the moment. What's taking him so long? Where are you heading? - Where do you want to go?|- To Hell. Hell? Marie, some Hell...? - Don't they mean Devil's Rocks?|- Oh yeah. Go down here... No, go right here, right, left,|turn after half a mile... Let's go! - Got it?|- Got it. -How much? - I took a thousand.|- Great. Guys, I've got to pee. - Shouldn't they be chasing us?|- We're safe now... - Only a thousand crowns?|- It was only a village bank. Can I drive now? Do you know how? I can't do the pedals. But|I can do the steering wheel. Let's do it together.|I can only work the gears. - So you don't need me anymore.|- You're going to do the pedals. /A farmer in the field /was looking for his cow... /For him villages or towns, /didn't matter now, /nothing but that cow,|/hiding in the grass... /as high as the ocean's deep. /Black water, blind fish,|/poisonous sea beasts, /in the farmer's head came|/the snap of the thread. /His spool's not turning, /and there's no conductor|/to say... /... while stroking his hair: /You're with me on my train|/in my care. I am driving! Don't go home,|the contest hasn't finished... I'd like to thank|to the volunteer Fire Department. Go away, kids! Get lost! So what's the story? You left|him, or he threw you out? No. We had a fight. And how long|have you been together? About four years.|But we've argued a lot, so we haven't been together|the whole time. It's really more like two years. And why do you fight? Don't know.|Spice up our lives I guess. And what do you do|when you're not fighting? We go away somewhere|and fight there too. - Want a smoke?|- I can't. I'm working. With the sun shining through|your ears, you look like an alien. My little girlfriend... For the monks who built this place|it was like taming the Wild West. There was nothing here.|Only forests... and more forests. Bears. Wolves. - And huge ants.|- How huge? Like this. The monks came with their saws. And chopped down the trees. They pulled out the stumps|and started hauling boulders. But first,|they killed the huge ants. I always thought of monks|as impotent cripples. They were regular guys.|Musclemen. And they did this all|by themselves? Yup. They built, painted,|wrote, and prayed to God. And there weren't any women? Women weren't allowed here.|For seven-hundred years. Do you smell it? It's in all monasteries.|It's the spirit of the place. It smells like this|in the confessional booth. I read somewhere that|when men live without women, they begin to give off|a funny smell. What d'you call it? - What are you trying to say?|- Something like ingraining? Absorbtion? Yeah. Absorbtion.|Semen absorbtion. For seven hundred years,|it's been evaporating here. I want you to do it to me here. Wimp. /I'm dying, /my strength's leaving me, /I forgive what I should, /and then I leave my body... /... while I turn into dust. /I'm dying and my only wish... /... is that|/you will dream of me. It musn't smell of cow shit. And I need my own room. And I need a stove. That little cottage looks nice. Or that tiny little one. This is a nice little cottage. I'm scared. That's that guy...|The one they set fire to. - That's Palach, right?|- That's Hus. That's the Red Fox. Sigmund. And he's saying, hey, buddy,|you there, Mister Jan Hus. Hey, that's Dusek.|From my school. A guitar. It's for me. Look at all the little records. Matuska, Sodoma... - Neckar... Korn!|- Kids, remember Korn? - You know how to turn it on?|- It still works? A record. Look. His picture's on it. Winnetou laughs|from the window... ...and Shatterhand|is kissing Rybana's breasts. Inchuchuna in the yard|started up his motorcar. Motorcar is bust.|Inchuchuna's dust. Blow it out! An old newspaper|from the communist times. In Sri Lanka due to conflicts|between the majority Singhalese, and the minority Tamils,|May Day has been outlawed. Simple solution.

Driver Hlasek delivered the cargo|straight to the Tymakov facility. There the grain will remain|over the weekend. Then it will be transported to|the Processing Centre in Prestice. - I don't get it.|- What are you reading? What is it?|It's a speech by Comrade Husak. Every paragraph here starts with|Comrades this and Comrades that. The Robin Hood of the desert... Saddam Hussein is|distributing Kuwaiti land... That was that war in the Gulf? That was January fifteenth,|Ninety-One. Two days before the war, I lost my virginity with Johnny. You were under age, weren't you? - I was fourteen.|- So now he is paying for it. See how happy this piece looks.|While all you guys do is argue. I had my first hysterical fit|of laughter playing this game. I was six. What's that? It's called a phone. An invention|over a hundred years old. Why is it ringing? Did you know that|the Americans won the WWII... ...because they knew|how to use the telephone? Loser gets us|something to drink. And some food. - Five.|- That's silly. Two. Ha! One. That's stupid. But you're going to have to go|anyway. Radek can't drive. How come she's doesn't have|anything there? I wonder what they look like now.|How old they must be. Maybe fifty. Or sixty. What would you have done, if|you had stayed here with Frank? He's a man. What do you mean by that? He'd take what he wants. So you'd sleep with him? Anne, would you? I want to talk|about something else. Yeah, but this interests me,|so tell me. You want to know? You really want to know? Yes I do. And can you handle it?|Can you take it? Maybe we already have. When did you have the time to?|I was always with you. Promise me that|you won't say anything. I would feel ashamed|and you would look silly. Maybe in Susice. You slept|like a baby all night. - Frank wouldn't do it to me.|- Yes he would. What are you going to do? What? - I don't know.|- Are you a man, or what? Go away, will you? Get lost. I'm bored. When did he call? It's always the same thing. I don't know.|Somewhere in Sumava. In Loucky. Yeah. Whatever he says.|I don't care. Hi Anne. What is it? I don't want to! It hurts! You bastard.|I'm going to scream. C'mon does it really|hurt that much? I don't want to cause you pain.|But it has to be done. Don't. I won't scream anymore. - You have to be brave.|- I couldn't stand it. - It won't last long.|- My hands hurt. I'm sorry. Where are you going?|Don't leave me here. Untie me you bastard! What's that? What's that for?|What are you going to do with that? Radek! Radek, talk to me. For God's sake,|what are you doing with that? That's petrol. I love you. Don't scream. But there are candles everywhere. I know. I made all that up,|about Frank. Everything. You know, I actually|believed you for a while. So why are you doing this? - Because I love you.|- I love you too. But we're just not getting it|together, are we? It would always be like that.|We want it at different times. Now we can make love.|Then it will all be over. I haven't even said good-bye|to my Mum yet. She has no idea where I am. I've got beer and sausages.|When you're thru, I'll be outside. I can't do this. Do it.|Untie my legs and do it. I want it.|I really really want it. I can't do this. One chicken, seventy five. - Do you have any soups?|- We do, we do. Packed soups, ghoulash,|beef, leek. I'll show you... French, pea, beef... - We should go after them.|- I don't think so. I don't have her address|or telephone number. If she wanted you to have it,|she'd have given it to you. Sometimes girls forget to... No they don't. You know, I wonder... ...if she called him before|or after she was with you. Why? Well if she called after, then|that doesn't say much about you. Alright. I'll tell you. I never slept with her. You're an idiot. I really didn't. We're free-wheeling. Tailor, Sailor, Soldier, Daddy. - Don't call me daddy.|- We are facing a major decision: East or west. Because we're through|with the south.
