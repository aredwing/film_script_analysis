Make it snow again. - Blow the whistle. - All right. How's that? - Could you wait on me? - In a moment, madam. I'm sorry, but I'm in a hurry. This gentleman was here before you. I know, but I wanna buy one. I have no reason to believe this gentleman's not a potential customer. - Blow the whistle. - Sorry, senator. The lady seems to have friends in high places. Let me tell you about the train. There's really never been one like it. This one's been around the world. Fast, economical, easy to operate and very... I'll take one, complete with all attachments and accessories. You're not letting me earn my salary, skimpy as it is. - That'll be 79.50 plus tax. - I have it right here. - Twenty, 40... - It's all there. Sixty... - Where would you like us to send it? - Oh, I'll take it with me. We'll be glad to send it. It's heavy. - It'll get there tomorrow. - No, thank you. Just put it in a box. It doesn't even have to be fancy. Oh, I'm going to rewrap it anyway. If you give me the claim, I'll pick it up at the call desk. - And thank you very much. - It's a pleasure. You come back again. Thank you. Fisher and Lewis? Miss Neely, please. Comparison Shopping. Connie Ennis. I'm in the department. Hello, Miss Neely? I have a report on those 54-gauge nylons for you. Gimbel's, Wanamaker's and Bloomingdale's have the same price... ...as our sun bronze. Mm-hm. Exactly the same. Yes, I'm at Crowley's now and I just bought the train. I was wondering if I could wait till morning to bring it to you for comparison. I thought while I was on this floor, I could buy my boy a suit for Christmas. It's getting awfully late and I'm tired. I'd like to go straight home. Oh, thanks a lot, Miss Neely. Goodbye. Good evening, Mrs. Ennis. Good evening, Mr. Ennis. Oh, you tried to surprise me, huh? - I was watching out the window. - Oh, you were? Oh, is it good to see you. Look, I lost another tooth. Did you put it under the pillow? - Yup. - Attaboy. - Can I help, Mom? - Thank you, darling... ...but they're pretty heavy. They for me? Mm, one of them might be. - The big one? - It's for the store. Business. Then why is it tied up in red ribbons? If you buy a garbage can Christmas week, they tie it up in red ribbons. Joey. You and Timmy have a good afternoon? Dinner's all ready. All you do is heat it up. - Oh, thanks so much, Mary. - See you tomorrow. Good night. Good night, Tim. Good night, Mary. Sorry I stepped on your toe. It was only an accident. Well, what did you do all day, Mr. Ennis? Oh, I played and played with Joey in the park. Oh, that's good, darling. What'd you play? - Oh, we threw rocks at girls. - Timmy. It was all right. We missed them. What'd you do all day, Mrs. Ennis? Oh, I worked and worked and now my feet hurt. Oh... You're tired, huh, Mom? I was, but I'm not now. Not once I'm home with my fella. I'm gonna get you. Let me see where you lost your tooth. Here, come on. Oh, you're gonna be all right. I don't have to worry about you. Mm. There. You know, you're getting to look more like your daddy every day. Mom, does it hurt much to die? No, I don't think so, darling. - Bye, Joey. - So long, Joey. - Ha-ha. Doesn't he ever say goodbye? - No. He doesn't like to. - Maybe because he lives upstairs. - Oh. - Did Carl call? - Yeah, he called. He said he'd be over later. While I add a few elegant touches to our dinner... ...how would you like to go wash up? - Mm. No arguments, now. Why don't you get out of that hot sweater? Put on a clean shirt for dinner. - And don't forget anything. - All right. A train! Boy, this is what I've been wanting for months. Oh... Timmy? Timmy. Timmy. Timmy, what in the world are you doing in?... Just washing my face, Mom. What's going on around here? Nothing. After dinner, you better pick up your toys. I almost broke my neck. And, honey, you haven't got a shirt on. You might catch cold. Timmy. I'm coming, Mom. Well, I can't seem to find anything to accuse you of... ...but, nevertheless, raise your right hand and repeat after me: I will do no peeking at the presents in this closet until Christmas morning. I will do no peeking into this closet until Christmas morning. Here. Let me get your shirt. What are you laughing about? I just feel good. - What do you feel so good about? - Oh, I don't know, Christmas, surprises. I just feel good, that's all. Christmas is wonderful, honey, but you can't expect miracles. Or even hope for them. My teacher says we shouldn't be afraid to wish for things. Even things we don't think we could get in a million years. I don't agree with her. You wish for things you can get, you'll be happy. But if you wish for big things, all you're gonna get are big disappointments. - Oh, Mom. - Come on, now. Out of the danger zone. What are you leaving that one out for? I'm gonna put it here so I won't forget it in the morning. I know what you're gonna do. You're gonna take it down the hall to Mrs. Martin so I won't peek at it. No, honey, I told you. That's not for you. - Well. - Dishes done? Of course not. No, you don't. Come back in here. Oh, for me? For the store. It has to go back. Since you're stuck with housework, why didn't you come for dinner? I've been writing a long, flowery brief. Oliver Wendell Holmes couldn't touch it. - Oh, really? - Hi, Tim. - Oh, hi. - Getting ready for Christmas? - Mm-hm. - Ah... We'll go pick out a tree tomorrow. - Can I really help? - Wouldn't have it any other way. We might even sneak in a movie if I can get out of work soon enough. Gee, that'd be swell. Talk Carl into a game of checkers, I might let him off dishes. Well, he's a pretty tough guy to beat, but okay. I'm sorry, Carl, but I'm kind of tired. I played hard today. Think I ought to go to bed, huh, Mom? All right, darling. Why don't you listen to a couple of programs? Good night, sweetheart. Don't forget to feed your turtles and brush your teeth. Do I have to brush where the lost one came out? No, brush around where the lost one came out. Good night. I wear everybody out with everything he says. I might as well warn you right now that compliments will get you no place. - I'll do it the dangerous way. - You'll be sorry. Whew. You look like a tired beautiful girl instead of just a beautiful girl. It was a rough day, all right. I think everybody in New York was out shopping. What did you buy me? One of those new English cars. Here, alley-oop. I may let you ride on the handlebars. Show you off to the boys. But I haven't got a thing to wear. Ha-ha. - Hey, we're getting good at this. - Pretty good team. Why do we limit it to dishwashing? Marry me and I'll buy you a dishwasher. A cute little French one with a tight skirt. What do you say, Connie? Could you give me a little more time, Carl? You've had almost two years. Well, you know what they say: "This is so sudden. " You've got to have someone to buy loud neckties for. You told me about them. Boy, I sure bought Guy some beauts. - How he must have hated wearing them. - I'll bet he didn't. Any more than I would. Carl, I like you very, very much. You know that. But I don't feel that I... Connie, I've gotten a lot of divorces for a lot of people. Most took one look at each other and said, "This is it. " Married two days later and split up two years later. But I've never gotten a divorce for two people that really liked each other. But, Carl, there's Timmy. - Are you sure you're ready?... - Are you trying to talk me out of this? I promise you won't have to ask me again, Carl. If it's yes, I'll ask you. Does it feel like yes? Sort of. I'll tell you what it does feel like. Time to do these pots and pans. And this time you're gonna need this. There. You know, I'll never forget the day you hired me. There I was, sitting at the agency with all the other girls. I was afraid you were gonna take Evelyn. Hey, night owl. What are you doing still awake? Oh, I was thinking. I can't go to sleep. I've got something for you to think about. You like Carl, don't you? Sure, he's a nice guy. He just asked me to marry him. Are you going to? I might. Why? Oh, for a lot of reasons. We could be a real family. I like us the way we are. I don't want anybody else. We could have a house with trees and a yard. You might even have a dog. I like this place. I don't want anything to change. We'd be the same as we are, Timmy. Only better. Well, I guess so. Be especially nice to Carl when he comes over tomorrow. Why? Is it his birthday? No. I just want him to feel that you like him a lot. Well... Good night, Mr. Ennis. Good night. If you marry him, you won't be Mrs. Ennis anymore. Excuse me. Excuse me. Could you wait on me, please? Oh, I'm sorry, ma'am, but I'm busy. Well, hello. - Oh! - May I help you? - Oh, hello. - Well, I'll tell you what... - Came to return the train, huh? - It wasn't exactly what I wanted. - I didn't think it would be. When I got home, my little boy said... Oh, it was for your boy? Why, yes, of course. Is that so? Anything strange about that? What's your boy's name, Macy's, Saks, Gimbel's... ...Wanamaker's or Fisher and Lewis? I tagged you yesterday. When you came back today, I knew I was right. Didn't ask me a lot of questions about the train. Didn't ask me the price. But you had the exact amount all ready, including the tax. You didn't want me to send it. You didn't want Christmas wrappings. It didn't take the greatest brain in the world to spell out "comparison shopper. " What are you going to do? I press a little button. A store detective rushes up and takes your picture. We send a copy to every department and that ends your activities in this store. And I get fired. Hazard of the profession. If you're gonna be a spy, you gotta expect a firing squad. My boy ends up getting his shoes from Children's Aid... ...and you're a great big man. I thought we'd be getting back to little Butch. His name is Timothy. He's 6 and a half years old. I support him. What does your husband do? Is he working his way through college? My husband's dead. He was killed in the war. Would you like to hit me over the head with this? I didn't mean to bring that in, but... I asked for it. Well, what now? Now I write you a refund slip... ...which I have a feeling I'm gonna live to regret. - Oh, thank you very much. I'm... - Name? Connie Ennis. I'm awfully grateful for your doing this. It means an awful lot to me. - Address? - 165 East 75th Street. Look, do me a favor. There are 56 departments in this store. Don't come back to this one, okay? Okay. Thanks again. Psst. Could you wait on me, please? I'd like the union suit you have advertised. Ribbed cotton, fleece-lined, long sleeves... ...and I think it also has... - Darling, you remembered. Now, let me see. Your husband wears about a size 42 or 44, I believe. Oh, no. I want the special. The 56. Fifty-six? Madam, do you realize how big that is? We just have a few of them made for fat men. Fifty-six, please. Well, that's what they told me to get. Still engaged in commercial espionage, I see. Fisher and Lewis have to eat. Let me give you a tip. You're much too professional. A customer doesn't know what she wants until she sees it. - And then she doesn't want it. See? - Ha-ha. Well, um, what are you doing down here? I got fired. Oh, no. Because of me? I was supposed to turn you in. That's a rule, you know. Oh... How in the world did they find out? Little floorwalkers have big ears. - Well, is there anything I can do? - There certainly is. When I was a working man, I used to eat with the boys. But now, well, I somehow just don't feel they'd want me. - And since it's lunchtime... - I'll even buy your lunch. That's roughly what I had in mind, except I'll buy yours, on one condition. You let me take you to my favorite restaurant and I do the ordering. I'm entirely in your hands. Here we have a 56. - It's the only one left, but... - It's just exactly what I want. Would you wrap it? I'll pick it up later. But, madam... L... Really, I... Madam. Madam, I ask you. Well, I like them loose. Now, there's the happiest guy in New York. He'll never be president of the First National Bank. - Why don't you tell him to move over? - Not me. I can't balance a ball on my nose. I don't like raw fish. No, I don't wanna be him, I don't think he'd like to be me. Wait a minute. You don't have to agree so fast, sport. - Dessert? - Sure. Thank you. - Thanks. - Thank you. Steve, all I know about you so far is that... ...you don't wanna be a Central Park seal or president of First National. What do you wanna be? It has a way of sounding odd to some people. I wanna build boats. - Boats? - Yeah. Not the Queen Mary, just little sailboats. I don't think it sounds odd. I think it sounds very exciting, but why aren't you doing it? Well, for one thing, the war nipped about five years out of my life. Then when I got out, I made the mistake of listening to people. "Do something sensible," they said. "Sell real estate or washing machines or mousetraps... ...but cut a few throats and wind up vice president. " So I got me a nice, cozy job with a finance company. Wore young-executive suits. Lived in one room and cooked on a two-burner. And you prospered and you grew fat. That was the plan. Every Monday I'd buy a chunk of meat to last all week. I'd cook it six different ways until by Saturday night it wound up goulash. Week after week. Until one Monday... ...I walked in the butcher shop... ...there was the meat all wrapped and waiting for me... ...but my stomach turned over and screamed, "Please, bud, not again. " I looked the butcher in the eye... ...told him to give me the biggest porterhouse in the joint. Wish I had a mink coat for every time I wanted to do that. That steak changed my whole life. It was too big for me to eat by myself, so I invited a friend over. His wife was out of town. While we sat there gorging ourselves, he told me about a job. He couldn't take it because he was married. It was a job on a boat going to South America. I asked for it, got it. Since you wouldn't go looking for a boat, a boat came for you. Exactly. Anyway, that did it. How can selling trains at Crowley's help you to build boats? Oh, the trouble with you is you don't believe in happy endings. I've got a friend I met in the Army. He's got a little boatyard down in Balboa, California. It's not much now, but it could be built into something. I'm buying into it. I take every job I can get. Every time I get $ 100 together, I send it to him. It may never make me a million, but for me it's more fun... ...than digging for oil in Texas or coal in Kentucky. My gosh, I've gotta start digging for carpet sweepers at Gimbel's. If you had told me that anyone could keep me for two hours over hot dogs... I'll help you make up your time. I'll be your bachelor friend and you'll be an interior decorator... ...helping me decorate my apartment. - All right. You always make people talk this much? No. And I don't always like listening this much. If you've always got stuff to carry, you ought to put me on the payroll. I once had to carry a bowl of goldfish on a Fifth Avenue bus. I dropped one down a woman's back. I think I saw the picture. Well, it almost happened. Ha-ha-ha. You gotta quit looking so happy. People will think we just got married. Steve, there's the bus. We've gotta get it. Hurry. - Oh, Steve. - Hey, Connie. Stop ringing that bell. Hey, Connie! Hey, Connie! Oh. Will you take this a minute? - Yes, dear. Henry. - Mabel. - Steve. Oh, Steve. Driver, let me out of here. Driver! Steve! Wow. Oh, Connie. We wanted to have it finished before you saw it. The man said it wouldn't shed. Timmy picked it out, after a double hot fudge sundae to give him strength. Well, it's absolutely the most beautiful Christmas tree I have ever seen. Mr. Ennis, you're a fine picker-outer. Have you a kiss you don't know what to do with? - Lf he hasn't, I have. - I'm sorry. It's spoken for. - How's my baby? - We wanted to surprise you. You're home early. Oh, well, I misplaced some packages at, uh, Wanamaker's, I think it was. I can't go back till I find them. Mary? I wonder if there are any calls. I let her go home early. We're taking you out to dinner. Oh, you're a very pleasant man. - Do it again. - Hmm? - See what you do to me? - Oh, you're crazy. Oh, honey, why don't you change into your gray suit for dinner, huh? Go on. Did you tell him about us? Told him that you asked me. How did he take it? Well, you know how children are, Carl. They don't like changes. It scares them. I remember we moved once when I was about 4. Mother threw away an awful lot of junk... ...and I worried that she was gonna throw me away too. I'm glad she didn't. Honey... ...when we take down the lights this year, let's not tie them into knots, huh? I don't want to spend an hour next year trying to untangle them too. Have you got anything to ask me? Anything romantic? I'm all ready and I've got my new tie on. Well, Mr. Davis, long have I admired you from afar... Maybe I should've come down the chimney. Where'd you go, to a matinee? I looked all over for you. It's the last time I ever pick up a girl at Christmas. - Here, let me help you with the packages. - Oh, hello. How do you do? - This is Steve, uh... - Mason. Uh... Carl Davis. How do you do? - The man from Wanamaker's? - Crowley's. - I lost her in the crowd... - We met at Crowley's this morning. - She got me fired and we tried... - That's how we met. Mr. Mason carried my packages to the bus stop... ...and we got separated. In the crowd. It happens in crowds. It's warm in here. I called your hotel, they said you weren't there. - Where'd you find me? - It wasn't easy. I forgot your address, tried the phone book. - It's a new phone. - Yeah. I couldn't take your packages to Fisher and Lewis, so I called them. But they never heard of you. They never give out information. They didn't have to act like I was Jack the Ripper. I went over to the store and kibitzed around. I wormed your address out of some walleyed blond in the Payroll Department. Brother, what a day. Dear, why don't I get Mr. Mason a drink? - Hey, this fellow's got it upstairs. - I'll get us all one. Looks as though we might have a white Christmas. That's right. Never seems like Christmas unless it is white. That's right. We don't seem to get the big snows we used to when we were kids. That's right. It just comes down slush now. That's right. Probably got something to do with the atomic bomb. Hey, that's right. Last year, it rained. That's right. I remember. They need rain in California. Is that so? I read it in the papers. I'm from California. - That so? - Never rains. Is that so? I was in California one June. Is that so? Rained all the time. Must have been about 10 years ago. That's right. Very unusual. Is that so? - Mind if I go on trimming my tree? - No. No, you go right ahead. Thank you. Guy? Yeah. Tim's a lot like him, Connie says. Tim's her son. I know. She says he has the same habits and everything. He never knew his father, did he? No. Connie talks about him all the time. It's wonderful the way she keeps him, well, sort of alive. Is it? After all, he's not alive. Here, let me help you. - Thank you, Carl. - Here you are, Mason. - Thank you. - Well. Nothing like a good... - Well, there's nothing like a good... - Here's to a merry... - Here's to a merry... Christmas. Oh, here's Timmy. Come here, darling. I want you to meet the man of the house. - Mr. Ennis, this is... - Hi, Tim, I'm Steve Mason. Hi, Mr. Mason. He looks like you. - Do you think so? - Oh, sure. Everyone says he's the image of his father. Timmy, I've gotta ask you a couple of questions. I'm sorry, but it's a rule for grownups. - Like how old I am, what grade I'm in? - That's right. When you grow older, you have the right to be annoying. Okay. Go ahead. Um... What do you like best at school? The other kids. Uh... What are you gonna get for Christmas? Clothes. That's what I always get. Clothes. You won't be able to wear what I'm getting you. A camera. How did you know? Because you asked me if I wanted one a long time ago. I don't think that sounds very nice. Oh, he didn't mean it the way it sounded. Tim, if everything works out the way I hope it will... ...you'll be getting a lot next Christmas you won't be able to guess. You don't have to get me anything. - Timmy, you go to your room. - No. - Do what your mother says. - I don't wanna. You can't make me. - Timmy. - Now, wait a minute, son. I'm not your son, and you can keep your old camera. - You go to bed. - You can keep your hands... ...off of my mother too. Carl, leave him alone. Carl, get your hands off my boy! Carl. - I'm sorry, Carl. - Good night, Connie. Carl? Go to bed and you don't get any supper. Thanks. What happens now, bread and water for a week? Ha. I come to return a few packages, and look what happens. Well, it didn't have anything to do with you. Oh, it didn't? You didn't tell Carl about me. It wasn't important. Well, maybe not telling him made it seem important. He went out of his way to say "hands off" to me... ...and to take possession of Timmy. That may be why the kid flared up. Oh, I don't think so. Ha. Fine welcome you got, after all the trouble I put you to. Well, I wanted to see the Ennises at home. Well, you certainly saw them. But if people would just let us alone... I mean... I don't know what I mean. Goodbye, Connie. And I'm not coming back. Well, now, what brought that on? I think it'll save us both a lot of trouble. I might fall in love with you. It's not impossible. Might even ask you to marry me one day, and you'd say no. Not that you're not right, but what makes you so sure? I think it's written all over the walls. You want everything just the way it is. The status quo. You and Timmy. No changes. You even got him wanting it. Go on. Don't stop now. Connie, look. Don't make him grow up, help him. He's a wonderful kid. Let him be a kid for a while. Stop trying to make him over into your husband. - You don't know what you're talking about. - Well, you call him the man of the house. Mr. Ennis. You get upset when somebody doesn't think he looks like his father. You even keep fooling around with his hair to try to make it look like the picture. Why don't you quit trying to hang on to something you've lost? Is that all? Take another look in that crystal ball of yours. There must be something else. Whatever happened to this girl? You ever see her around? You're so sure of everything. Half an hour's talk in the park... ...and you set yourself up as one of the wise men of the East. Except that you're wrong. On every single solitary point, you're wrong. - For instance? - That I don't want any changes. I want everything just as it is. I suppose that's why I'm gonna marry Carl. Well, that could be. If you do, you're going to have a problem with Tim. I'm not going to have any problem with Tim. He loves Carl. Mm-hm. There's a poem that runs roughly, "Each man kicks the things he loves. " - That's not why he kicked him. - He's got other reasons? No child is happy when his mother remarries. It takes time to make the adjustment. Of all the people to tell someone what's wrong with them. You and that philosophy of yours. You'll be 90 before you build a canoe. You thought it was so interesting. Well, now I don't. Okay, Connie. I'm on my way. Do you mind if I say goodbye to Tim? Hello, who is it? Oh, hi, Joey. Wish I could come over, but Mom sent me to bed with no dinner, darn it. Bye, I gotta go now. Hello. Hello, Timmy. Sorry I was so bad in there. Yeah, you kicked up quite a fuss. - Think he's really mad at me? - No. Next time you see him, tell him you're sorry. He'll understand. - He looks like a pretty nice guy. - He is. I don't know why I was so mean in there. I let them swim in the bathtub every day. Once one of them got kidnapped in the vacuum cleaner. Then I went to the rescue to rescue him. You ought to get them a hyacinth blossom. I'll see if I can find one for you. They like to nibble on it. It's like catnip for cats. How do you know? Oh, they had some in a toy department where I once worked. How did Mom get you fired? That door. - I can hear things through it sometimes. - Uh-huh. Especially when you put your ear next to it. I, uh, drilled a hole in my bedroom floor when I was a kid. So I could look down into the living room. But how did Mom get you fired? Oh, I sold her a train, and then when she brought it back... ...I didn't do something I was supposed to. A little electric train? Red and silver? - With a whistle and a?... - Oh, you saw it, huh? - Yeah, but don't tell Mom. - Oh, I won't. I opened the package and took a peek. I thought it was for me, but it wasn't. Gee, it was sure a swell train. Timmy, you know when you got mad in there? - Mm-hm. - Well, sometimes when I get mad... ...I find out it's about something different than what I thought. That ever happen to you? - Guess we're a lot alike. - Ha. I guess we are. Well, anyway, do you suppose it was not getting the train you were really mad about? I don't even let myself think about it anymore. Because I know I can't have it. Look, Timmy, let me show you something I learned when I was a kid. Here. Hop up. Now, you take the ball and try to hit the moon on the blackboard. Now, aim right at it. Oh, heck. Okay, don't give up. Now, try again... ...and this time, aim a little bit higher than the moon. - That's it. - I hit the moon! That's the idea. You see, if you aim higher than your mark... ...you've got a better chance of hitting the mark. So if you wish real hard for something... ...maybe you might get it. That's what my teacher said. But I don't know. I wished and wished for the train till my stomach hurt. But Mom took it back anyway. Well, that shouldn't make a big fella like you quit. Goodbye, Tim. - I hope you have a wonderful Christmas. - Thanks. I'll see if I can't rustle you up a little supper. Don't worry. When I'm bad, Mom gives me supper anyway. Oh! Merry Christmas. - Hello, Carl. - Hi. Oh, thank you. Well, I wish I'd have had time to get home and get pretty. The flowers were lovely, Carl. Thank you. And so was the note. Made me feel very sought-after. You are sought-after. Jean. - Oh. Thank you. - Wish to order now, sir? - No, later. Two martinis, please. Very dry. - One with two olives. - Yes, sir. I'm sorry about last night, Connie. It was my fault. I don't know why I didn't tell you about Steve. Oh, I don't care about him. That wasn't what bothered me. It was that "Take your hands off my boy. " - Well, you know I didn't mean that, Carl. - No, I don't know. Let me tell you how I feel about it. If we do get married, and I hate that "if," Timmy can be one or two things to me. He can be your son that lives in our house... ...and I'll be very nice to him. Or he can be our son. But in that case, I'll bawl him out and spoil him... ...and discipline him and worry about him and love him. If we do get married, Carl, he'll be our son. Thank you. - He called me up today. Mm-hm. - Timmy? Mary dialed the number for him. He said he was sorry and I shouldn't be mad at him and other nice things. - Kept me waiting while he blew his nose. - Ha-ha. Well, I'm glad he called you, Carl. I'm really glad. Thank you. Why don't you marry me, Carl? New Year's Day. I'm not kidding. We'll start the year off right. Are you gonna play hard to get? No... ...but what made this switch? I don't want uncertainty anymore. Besides, as I was saying yesterday, long have I admired you from afar. This is gonna be a wonderful evening. Got it all figured out. We're gonna have dinner, take in Moss Hart's new show... ...then go home, be sure Timmy's asleep... ...and you and I are gonna sit on the sofa and neck. Oh, is that what married people do? Mm, and... - Merry Christmas! - Oh! Merry Christmas! Mom, Mom. Thank you, thank you. - For which present, sweetheart? - You sure did fool me. - Oh, what, baby? - Telling me not to get... I wouldn't get anything wonderful for Christmas. But when I saw it outside the door... Mom. Mom. Telling me to get the milk from the hall if I woke up early. You knew I'd wake up early Christmas. - Hey! - Oh, well, let's see. I gotta see what's going on around here. - Look. I already opened it. - What?... Mom, Mom. I love it. - I love you. - Oh, I'm sure glad of that. See, these two go together and the cars light up. And it says Red Rocket Express on the cars too. It's a wonderful train, sweetheart. And the doors open and, oh, there was a note in it. You put it in and you forgot I can't read big words. Here. Let me see. Uh... "Timmy, this whistled at me when I passed and said it wanted you for Christmas. " It's signed "Santa. " I guess it's from Santa Claus. Santa Claus. Mom. Oh, I got a surprise for you too. Look, I fixed it up all myself. I've been looking for that stocking. - I had it hid away. - You little character. - Christmas gift. - Oh, Tim. - You gonna open it? - Lf you'll give me time. It's perfume, not toilet water. Real perfume. Oh, my goodness. Oh, I know, I can see. Look. I saved up for it all myself. But I had to tell the lady in the store it was for you... ...so she wouldn't think I was a little girl. - Ha-ha-ha. - I'm gonna give you a kiss for this. - Don't need it, no. You're gonna get one whether you need it or not. I fooled you. - You fooled me, I fooled you. - You sure did. Say, but how did you know I wanted the train so bad? - I didn't tell anyone except Mr. Mason. - Mr. Mason? Yeah, and he said he wouldn't tell you. Oh, I know. I didn't get the ribbon back on right, so you knew I peeked at it. - You always know everything. - You peeked at it? Yeah, that one you brought home for the store. I thought it was for me. Then I said it wasn't, didn't I? - Yeah, and then I cried. - Aww... Now I guess I'm so happy... ...if I was a dog, my tail would be wagging. Well, Tim... Tim, I've gotta tell you about that train. I wonder who that is. I'll be right back, sweetheart. Merry Christmas, darling. Did I wake you up? Well, I couldn't sleep. I don't know any reason why you should. Well, I'm a little upset. A present arrived for Tim. A little electric train. I'm sure it's from Steve Mason. He's the only one that knew Tim wanted the train for Christmas. I haven't the faintest idea why he did it. It's simple enough. He moves in on Tim, makes my camera look like the head of a pin... ...and makes his play for you. I'm not interested in his motives. All I wanna know is what to do about it. I can't take it away from Tim. And I can't accept something like that from Steve. It's too expensive. Well, let's give him his money back. I can't let you do that, Carl. Look, I'll work something out. I'm too upset to talk about it now. I'll call you later, huh? Okay. Bye. - Timmy? - I'm in the kitchen, Mom. I'm setting the table so you won't have to. Why, thank you, sweetheart. I'm gonna take better care of my stuff from now on. - And wash more. - Oh, well, that'll be wonderful. - You know the cup the mouse broke? - Mm-hm. - Well, he didn't. - Mm-hm. I didn't think he did. Mom, the train costs so much... ...couldn't we take my other presents back... ...and get the money back? I didn't get you that train, Timmy. Well, who did? Mr. Mason, the man that was here the other day. - Mr. Mason? - Mm-hm. Gee, he must he awfully rich. No, he's not. Well, I only met him once. I know you did. He must have liked you an awful lot. This is the nicest thing anybody ever did for me. Except you, I mean. Oh, I'm everyday. This was special. I'll have to thank him. I may be able to do that for you. It's pretty early. I think I can catch him at his hotel after breakfast. I have a few things I wanna talk about to Mr. Mason. I'll go with you. You can't do that. Grandma and Grandpa will be here soon. You promised you'd let them watch you open presents, so don't open any. Ask Mr. Mason if he can come and eat with us... ...maybe help me set up the trains. I can't do that either, honey. It's gonna be Grandma and Grandpa and Carl. Here, why don't you eat with your spoon? It might be a big help. Been awfully nice to Carl these last few days. Sure. Hey, if Mr. Mason can't eat with us... ...maybe he can come over for a little while anyway. Well, I'll see what he says. I'll ask him. We'll have to have a present for him. Well, all the stores are closed. There's a lot of presents he might like under the tree. Timmy, those are for Carl. Well, the wallet has his initials on it, and so does the key ring. Well, the necktie hasn't. Timmy, we couldn't do that. Oh, I'Il... We'll talk about it later. Go on, eat your corn flakes. With your spoon. Mr. Mason, please. - Steve Mason? - Yes, that's right. He doesn't live here anymore. He checked out. Oh, he did? When? Oh, over an hour ago. - Did he leave a forwarding address? - Nope. - Are you sure? He didn't say anything? - No. He just left with a big Christmas package. - Yes, I know about that. - Ha. You know, he's a funny fella. I asked him to join me in a cup of coffee and he said, "No, thanks. " He said he was gonna have breakfast... ...with a guy that didn't wanna be president of the First National Bank. Ha. - Maybe you can figure it out, lady. - Yes, I think I can. Thank you very much. Well, what brings you here? Well, what brings you here? Can this be coincidence? No, I went to the hotel and the clerk... From what he said... ...I figured you must be here. - What did you wish to see me about? Step into the office. - Breakfast? - Oh, no, thanks. I've eaten. Who's your friend? Oh, it's an orphan. I'm all it has in the world. Steve, why did you get Timmy the train? Because I wanted to. You know you can't afford it. It was sweet of you and all that, but I can't let you do it. I wanna give you the money. Some now, the rest tomorrow. Sorry, the train is strictly a personal matter between my friend and me. - But, Steve, really... - Sorry. Two weeks ago we sat down, made a list of everything Timmy wanted. - And he didn't say anything about a train. - I know. I used to have to make out lists when I was a kid too. It took me 20 years to get over the habit. I'm trying to save Tim a little time. But he shouldn't feel he'll get everything he wants. Well, not always, but every now and then so he'll know that these things can happen. Besides, a train seemed just right. It's exciting. It takes you to new places. For a kid that's been sold on the idea of no surprises at all, it seemed like a great idea. Well, he's just crazy about it. About you too. He sent you a Christmas present. Merry Christmas. - No. - Mm-hm. He wanted to come along and thank you, but I said I'd do it for him. He said getting that train was the nicest thing that ever happened to him. - Really? - Uh-huh. Now, how was he supposed to know I like noisy neckties? - Hey, Mac. - Yeah? - You want a tie? - Sure. Thanks, mister. What do you know, Christmas is here after all. - And many of them. - Thank you. Looks like you made a couple people happy this Christmas. Well, I couldn't wear two ties. - And one person a little unhappy. - Oh? Who's that? Carl. You know, you made a little trouble for me with that train. He suspects your motives. So would I, if I were in his shoes. I'm marrying Carl, New Year's Day. Good for you. Looks like a nice guy. Oh, he is. I know Carl. We've been friends for so long, I... I know where I stand with him. Everything will be safe and secure. And I feel awfully good about it. You ought to switch jobs. Quit buying, start selling. You're great at selling yourself a bill of goods. Look, Steve, I... You were married to a man you were in love with once. You ought to know it's impossible to be safe and secure when in love. What are you trying to do, crawl into a cave... ...and hide from everything that's gonna stir you up? If I want to. That's a neat trick if you get away with it, but I don't think you can. Life is gonna crawl right in there with you and kick your teeth out. I'll manage all right. Gotta take everything coming to you, Connie. All the surprises, good and bad. I can't afford surprises. Every surprise isn't a telegram from the War Department, you know. I should have known it was a mistake to come and see you again. - Then why did you come? - I told you why I came. I wanted to give you the money back for the train. You could have sent it. A stamp would take care of the whole thing. - Look, Steve, I came because... - Hey, mister. Mister. Hey, mister. Are you the man who gave the man a necktie? That's right. He said it was very nice of you to give him a Christmas present. And that now he wants to give you one back. That's what he said. - Well, where did he go, honey? - He said he had to go to Brooklyn. Thank you very much. Hey, shouldn't those be ice skates? - I didn't get any ice skates. - Oh. Kathy, look at what I got, roller skates. - Now, where do you suppose he got this? - I don't know. Maybe he's an eccentric millionaire. After all, everyone who wears old clothes isn't a hobo... ...just like everyone who give strange kids $80 trains isn't an eccentric millionaire. Just what I needed, salt and pepper shakers. I've been living like a pig. Steve, why did you check out of your hotel? I wanted a cheaper place for the couple of weeks I'm gonna be here. - Oh, you're going away? - Yeah, California. I'm gonna go to work in that boatyard, keep buying in. I'm just staying long enough to earn the fare. - So stop worrying about me. - Not worrying about you. All right, so Carl can stop worrying about me. Look, since I'm not gonna see you, can you have the decency not to be annoying? Sure. Goodbye, Connie. Have a nice, quiet life. - Mother. - Connie. - Merry Christmas. - Merry Christmas. - Merry Christmas to you. - Connie, darling, happy Christmas. - Merry Christmas. - Thank you, darling. - Oh, boy. - Connie, he looks just wonderful. - He must have grown at least two inches. - Oh, easily. And he's getting to look more like Guy every time I see him. - Father, you remember how Guy?... - Now, Mother. Oh, it's so good to see you two again. It's always much too long between visits. You know, we brought you your whole Christmas dinner. - The turkey's so big it'll last all week. - Oh, good. That's right. Mother's going to cook it. I'm going to wait on table and you won't have to do a thing. Oh, bless your heart, thank you. Look at the catcher's mitt Grandma and Grandpa brought me. And the baseball and the bat. And the slippers. - Isn't that nice? - Oh, yeah. Always, but you... - Mom, did Mr. Mason like his present? - Mm-hm. Oh, yes, about your young man, darling. We're looking forward to meeting him at dinner today. - My young man? - Well, Timmy told us all the news. And we're so happy for you. I think he must be awfully nice to go out and buy Timmy that wonderful train. I'm not gonna marry Mr. Mason. Timmy, you know well I'm not gonna marry Mr. Mason. I didn't say who you were gonna marry, just that you were gonna get married. He's been talking about Mr. Mason all morning. - When you rushed out early Christmas... - I hardly know the man. It's Carl I'm going to marry. - You remember, Carl Davis. - Carl? - Why, yes. - Why?... Well, I think that's just fine. Don't you think that's just fine, Father? Oh, yes. Yes, just fine. He called up. - Carl. - Oh, well, what did he say? Wanted to know where you were. Told him you went up to Mr. Mason's hotel to see him. Oh, swell, then what did he say? Said he'd be right over. See? - Merry Christmas, darling. - Merry Christmas. - For dinner. - Oh, good. - Mr. Ennis, Mrs. Ennis. - Oh, yes. - So good to see you again, Carl. - Good to see you, sir. Connie told us the news. We're so very pleased. - She talked me into it. - Oh... Hey, look at the train Mr. Mason bought me. So you saw Mason at his hotel? I didn't see him at the hotel. We talked in the park. - Park? - In the park? Yeah, we sat and talked in Central Park. He eats there... ...with the seals. Did he tell you why he gave Timmy the train? Yes, he said he did it because he wanted to. I went to give him his money back. After all, it was your idea. Did you give it to him? No, he wouldn't take it. Well, it's a very expensive present. If he hardly knows you and Timmy, it does seem odd that he'd... Yes, doesn't it? It's just the kind of a fellow he is. It doesn't seem odd at all. What are you so upset about, dear? Mom, why didn't you ask Mr. Mason to come over? Yes, why didn't you? Look, I can't explain this better than I have and I'm not going to try. If there's anything about it that's bothering you, it can stop... Well, because he's leaving anyway. He's going to California to build boats. - Going away? - Boats? Yes, boats. Those things that float on water. He's going to build them. I'm never going to see him... ...so why don't we open up our presents and have a nice Christmas? Mr. Mason? No, Johnson. Police department. Police? - What in the world?... - I don't know. I'm looking for a Mrs. Ennis. - I'm Mrs. Ennis. - I'm Mrs. Ennis. The Mrs. Ennis who was sitting on a park bench at 8:00 this morning, if she was? - That's me. - Do you know a man named Steve Mason? What's the matter? Something happen to him? He's in a lot of trouble. You might be able to clear it up for him. Oh, yes. What is it? What kind of trouble? The lieutenant said I shouldn't talk. But if you'll come with me, why, he'll listen to you. - Get your coat, dear. - All right. - I'm going too. - I don't think you should. I gotta. He's my friend, isn't he? Well, all right. But hurry. And shortly before 9 this morning in Central Park... ...a Mr. Mervin Fisher was hit on the head... ...tied up with a necktie... ...and robbed of a wallet containing $ 120... ...and a pair of silver salt and pepper shakers... ...a present for his aunt in Flushing. A little later, Officer McCleary, patrolling the park... ...noticed Mr. Mason loitering suspiciously. He admitted that he was unemployed, homeless... ...about to leave town and that the necktie belonged to him. The salt and pepper shakers were found on his person. I'm sorry. I just thought it was gonna be much worse. You expected the suspect to be involved in a serious crime? - Oh, no, no, nothing like that. - Connie. - Lieutenant, I'm a lawyer and... - Is that so? If I ever need a lawyer, I'll send for you. If I ever need a comical cop, I'll send for you. I'm defending this man, with your permission. With my profound gratitude, but with probably no fee. Why isn't Mervin Fisher here to identify the suspect? Because he didn't see who hit him. And he had to get to Flushing to see his aunt? Was Mr. Mason searched to see whether the stolen money was on his person? Searched? They looked four times in my ears. You must have liked that cell you were in, bud. Sorry. No more jokes. No, he didn't have the money. - All he had was $ 7.52. Well, then? Well, then, nothing. There's nothing easier to dump than money. I haven't got enough men to look under every rock in the park. Lieutenant, I think I can clear this up. Go ahead, ma'am... ...if, uh, Clarence Darrow here hasn't any objections. You've no idea how interested I am. I was with Mr. Mason in the park from 8 to 9 this morning. He gave his necktie to a man he thought was a hobo as a Christmas present. A few minutes later a little girl on roller skates with a balloon on her head... ...came with a present for him from the hobo. The salt and pepper shakers. A little girl on roller skates with a balloon on her head. Would you tell me whether a complaint has been lodged against Mr. Mason? - What's he got to do with this, anyway? - He's my lawyer. He's my fianc. We're to be married New Year's Day. Oh, I see. He's your fianc. On New Year's Day, you're gonna marry the counselor here? That's right. Then what were you doing in the park with this guy 8:00 Christmas morning? I don't see what this has to do with the case. Oh, you don't, huh? No. Well, I wanted to see him and he was in the park. He eats there with the seals. You see, early this morning a train arrived. An electric train for my boy, Timmy, from Mr. Mason. The guy's without a job. Broke. Without a bed to sleep in and he buys a kid an electric train. - Why? - Well, it's Christmas. Let's say I felt like giving somebody a present... ...and I didn't know anybody else in New York. Is that why you gave that hobo your necktie? Oh, I had just given Mr. Mason a new tie, the one he's wearing now. This morning, after his present arrived... You mind telling me where you bought a tie 8:00 Christmas morning? Oh, she had the tie. It was under the tree. It was one of the presents she had for him. The relationships of the parties involved have nothing to do with this case. You've nothing but the weakest circumstantial evidence. Oh, I don't know. Why did he hide behind the rock when he saw the policeman? I wasn't hiding. What were you doing? You'll never believe this. Oh, I might. Go ahead. Try me. I was feeding a squirrel. He's an orphan. He depends on me. The guy's without a job, gives Christmas presents to a tramp. Gets Christmas presents... ...from a little girl with a balloon on her head. Eats in the park with the seals. Is a mother and father to an orphan squirrel. You don't think this guy's a suspicious character? Everything we've said is true. Don't you believe us? Oh, sure. Everything you said jibed with what he said before you got here. I'm just saying... ...maybe this guy shouldn't be allowed out without a keeper. But can't he go free? I'd have to let him if he weren't planning to skip town. Oh, I'm not. I've got a room downtown. 137 Christopher Street. Changed your mind, huh? Gonna stick around for a while, huh? Well, just till I can earn the fare to California. I've got a job there. Why don't you touch him for it? I'll bet he'd be glad to get you a ticket to California... ...or the moon, just to get rid of you. Now, look here, lieutenant... - That's all. Case dismissed. Thank you. - And merry Christmas. It only looked like I was trying to send you to the chair. I didn't think you were for more than a minute or two. Not entirely for the lieutenant's reasons... ...but why don't you let me write a check for your fare? What if you don't get a job? They don't hire between Christmas and New Year's. Besides, it's only a loan. You can send it back. No, thanks anyway, but I'm planning to break the... You should pardon the expression. - Tie that binds. Mom, why can't Steve come home and have Christmas dinner with us? Oh, honey, I don't think... Uh... He must have plans of his own. No, he doesn't. He doesn't know anyone except us. He said so in there. It costs a lot of money to eat in a restaurant. - And we got a big turkey at home, Steve. - Oh, thanks, Timmy. - I'd love to, but I really can't. - Oh, Mom. Come on, Steve. Please. Please. And, you know, I like it so much, I couldn't take it off. I may pick out all your clothes from now on. Grandpa, kiss Grandma. Oh, sure. - Hold it. Now take me. There. - Well, how about seconds? Now, you just sit still. Remember, I'm the waiter here. - Then wait. - What? - I made a joke. - Oh... - I want a drumstick. - All right. - How many legs you think a turkey has? - They ought to have four like a horse. - I'll take it up with the Audubon Society. - I think I'll open another bottle of wine. Good idea. Mother, will you please finish your dinner? Oh, all right, all right. And don't get moody on me. Holidays, she always gets moody. Well, one remembers more on holidays. - Oh, I know. - The little things and the funny things. Anything will start you off. Like Mr. Mason's necktie. Forgive me, Mr. Mason, but it is a bit loud. Reminds me of those that Connie used to give to Guy. She always said, "This is a symbol of our wild and fiery love. " Mom gave Steve that one. Oh, Father, you've had four already. What you don't count won't hurt you, dearie. Besides, I need strength. - I'm going to make a speech. - Oh, good. Yay! Mother, I've been married to you 35 years. You boss me, you heckle me. You hide my things and pretend I've lost them... ...just so I have to depend on you. You've spent 35 years trying to make me admit... ...that I couldn't possibly get along without you. And you're right. I couldn't. What's more, I wouldn't want to. Every one of those years was good... ...even the bad ones, because you were with me. And so I drink to your health and all the wonderful years to come. Carl, just be as happy with Connie as I've been with Mother. That's all. That's not all at all. This has been the happiest Christmas of my life. I've never had a family of my own, and today I know what I've missed. But I'll never have to miss it again. From now on... ...I'll have a wife, a son... ...and if Connie will let me share them, a mother-in-law and a father-in-law. Oh, that's very nice. Yes. Connie... ...I've loved you for a long time. And I've waited for you a long time. But it was worth it. Steve, we wish you luck in your new job in California. And we're very happy that you're not alone this Christmas... ...but having dinner with us. Thank you. Oh, so nice. Now it's Steve's turn. Oh, no, I pass. I'm too full. - Come on. - Go ahead, Steve. Well... ...you've all been very kind to me. You've taken me in and given me a great dinner. And there's really nothing for me to say, after we've had dessert, of course... ...except thank you and goodbye. That's all I was going to say. But, well, you asked for it. Connie, I think Carl is just about one of the nicest fellows... ...I could ever hope to meet. But I think you ought to marry me. Father, we better go to the kitchen and bring the coffee and dessert. I don't think anybody wants it just now. Maybe you think it's wrong of me to speak this way in front of Timmy. I don't see how it can do a boy any harm to know... ...that two men like his mother. Maybe it's bad taste to speak in front of Carl. But would it be better if I sneaked around... ...and tried to get Connie behind the kitchen stove? I don't think so. If you think this is biting the hand that's fed me, then look at my problem. I've walked out of Connie's life a couple of times now... ...and each time something brings me back. Lost packages. A train. A cop. Accidents. I'm afraid I can't keep counting on accidents. If I walk out now, I'm sunk. I'll never see her again. The way I figure it... ...when a man's in love with a girl, he's got a right to ask her to marry him. Any girl. Anybody's girl. What do you say, Connie? I think you better get your hat and coat. That's a fair answer to a fair question. I wish you all a very merry Christmas. Where do I take this and get my money back? Toy Department, third floor. Hey, are you alone? No, I got somebody in the elevator. Third floor. Let me out. Hey, wait a minute. Somebody's broke my train. Hey. Oh, little man. What have we here? I got two trains for Christmas. My mom bought me one train and my friend bought me that one. So, please, can I have the money to give back to him? This train is broken, sonny. It's just a little broke. It got broke in the elevator just now. But I didn't do it. Honest. - Where's your mother? - My mother? - Yes, you're not here all alone, are you? - No. She's here. - Where? - She... She's in the bathroom. Imagine her nerve. So I said: "Madam, you go up and see Mr. Crowley. He owns the store. Show him your broken lamp, he'll be glad to give your money back. He does it all the time. " I'll bet you told her that. Where's Mr. Crowley's office? Eighth floor, sonny. Where's Mr. Crowley's office? - The secretary behind the partition. - Thank you. I see. Yes. Yes. Well, I'm sorry, but Mr. Crowley can't de disturbed at this time. You might try tomorrow morning. Well, hello. What is it, son? I gotta see Mr. Crowley. Please let me. Mr. Crowley? Are you alone? Yes, ma'am. What's your name? Timothy Ennis. Well, Mr. Timothy Ennis, what seems to be the trouble? I got two trains for Christmas. So, please, will Mr. Crowley give me my money back? Please? Well, I don't know. He's the only man who can help me. So, please, can I see him? Well... ...you come along with me and we'll see what we can do. Now, sit right here, Timmy. And don't run away. And I think I can get Mr. Crowley to see you. You won't call my mother or a policeman, will you? No, I won't call your mother or a policeman. Okay. Thank you. Emily, this is the meditation hour. I'm awfully sorry to disturb you, Mr. Crowley. But one of our customers, a Mr. Ennis, is outside asking to see you. You know I don't see the customers. I think you'll want to see this one. - Why? - Because Mr. Ennis is roughly 6 years old. - Six years old? - And seems to be in an awful lot of trouble. Well, is he here all alone? He's the alonest little fellow I ever saw. - Emily, don't keep the customer waiting. - Ha-ha. Timmy. Mr. Crowley... ...this is Mr. Timothy Ennis. I'm at your service, Timothy. Won't you come a little closer? I see you have our Red Rocket Express. I hope it hasn't proved unsatisfactory. L... I got two trains for Christmas. My mom bought me one train. And my friend bought me this one. So, please, can I have the money back? Well, Timothy, this is a little unusual. We'll have to look into it. It got broken in the elevator. - But I didn't do it. Honest. - I see. So you got two trains for Christmas, huh? No, I'll tell you the truth. I only got this one train for Christmas. Steve got it for me. He's my friend and he's real poor. And he hasn't got a job. And he shouldn't have spent his money, and I wanna give it back to him. And a lady said that you could help me. Now, now, now. Here. Take it easy. It isn't gonna be as bad as that. Now, come on. Stop crying. Here, now. Now, Timmy... ...suppose you tell me the story from the beginning. Well, it all started with my mother. Her name is Mrs. Ennis. And she works for Fisher and Lewis. - She's a comparison shopper. - Oh. And she bought a train here. Yes. Yes, officer, he's been missing most of the afternoon. He's never done anything like this before. I just don't understand it. We've covered the entire neighborhood. Every block within a mile. Oh, just a minute. Tim never ran away before, did he? Well, he hasn't run away. Why would he run away? No. That's right. A brown corduroy jacket, brown corduroy pants. Yes, and a blue wool hat. Oh, they've asked you that already. Why don't they go out and look? No, we haven't checked them yet. Checked where? The hospitals? Now, take it easy, darling. Yes, officer. That's right. Carl! Carl, look! Hi, Mom. What do you mean by going off like that? Don't ever do that. Are you all right? - Sure. - Where have you been all afternoon? - And who was the man in that car? - Mr. Crowley. He's nice. He said he wished he had a boy just like me. You mean Mr. Crowley from Crowley's Department Store? - Mm-hm. - That's miles from here. It's way downtown. I know. I almost got run over and killed twice. - Oh, Timmy. - It's okay. I didn't. Why did you wanna go to Crowley's? I took my train back. Oh, but why, honey? It wasn't any fun anymore. Oh, but you loved it so. It cost too much. Steve hasn't got a job. And maybe he doesn't have any money to eat anymore. Will you give him the money now? Please. He needs it. We don't know where he lives. 137 Christopher Street. Remember? He said so in the police station. - But I don't wanna leave you here. - It's okay. I'll go to sleep now. I'm tired. I walked a lot. Oh, my poor baby. And tell him I didn't take the train back because I didn't like it. We'll tell him. And tell him I'll never forget him. All of a sudden, I've got a big grown-up boy. Well, let's give him the money and have our dinner. Carl... ...you give him the money. I think I'll wait here. In the case of Connie Ennis v. Carl Davis... ...I offer certain facts into evidence. - Carl. The party of the first part, Connie Ennis... ...although known and loved by the party of the second part, Carl Davis... ...two long years did skillfully avoid the idea... ...of a marriage between them. However, upon the entrance of a stranger into her life four days ago... ...said Connie Ennis did immediately and suddenly consent to this marriage. But there was no connection. Since meeting this stranger, Connie Ennis, normally calm, stable and frank... ...becomes nervous, quick-tempered and evasive. Carl, I don't think I like this. Upon a proposal of marriage from the stranger... ...a thing rarely insulting to women... ...she becomes outraged and orders him from the house. - Well, for your sake... - Nevertheless... ...having heard his address but once, she remembers it. She hesitates about giving him money rightfully his... ...which might remove him from her immediate geographic area. And, in conclusion... ...she is fearful of seeing him again. I don't know why you're saying these things. The facts are plain and must be faced by the parties of both parts... ...however reluctant they are made by their goodwill for each other... ...wishful thinking... ...and long-standing affection. I submit that this case is ready for summation. This case? It's a divorce case, darling. Oh, I see. You've got it all added up. It's my business to add up facts. I'm a lawyer, you know. Or did you? I won a pretty important decision a few days ago. It was in all the papers. Maybe I wanted to show off a little about it. You never even mentioned it. Or anything about my work. I'm sorry, Carl. L... I've had so much on my mind. But surely you know I'm interested in everything you do. I know that as my wife... ...you'd be thoughtful, considerate and competent about everything. About our home, my health and my career. But I have a sneaking suspicion I ought to see if somewhere... ...there isn't a girl who might be in love with me. Even if she's a dumb, frowzy blond who slops up the house... ...and feeds me on canned beans. Carl, you've changed. Been a big week for both of us. It's an awful little train to carry enough dynamite to change a person's life. Anything can change a life that's ready to be changed. A toy train, a necktie, anything. My life was just changed by someone not getting out of a car. It's been a long time. No time is wasted that makes two people friends. Better give him the money. I'll wait five minutes. If you don't find more interesting company... ...we still have a date for dinner. You're a wonderful fellow, Carl. Compliments will get you no place. - It's the last room at the end of the hall. - Oh, thank you. And leave the door open. Come in. Well, you found the place. You know, few people come here to eat anymore. Too much atmosphere. We've been thinking of closing down the joint to redecorate. Uh... The landlady said to keep the door open. Let's worry her, huh? But, uh, let's not worry you. Well, I never expected to see you. I have $ 79.50 plus tax that belongs to you. I'm gonna get sore if people don't quit chasing me... ...trying to give me money. This is from Timmy. He took his train back all by himself. But why would he do that? He was crazy about it. He wants you to have the money. And he said to tell you that he'll never forget you. What a kid. Well. You're pretty good. Where'd you learn all this? Oh, I picked it up as I went along. Well, looks like a Happy New Year all around, huh? I can shake myself loose from this penthouse... ...and grab the first cheap train to California. You and Carl will be getting set for your honeymoon. Carl and I are not getting married. I guess that's my cue to propose again. But I'm not going to. Well, nobody asked you to. Wouldn't you like to know why? - Not particularly. - Well, I'll tell you anyway. You know, I've been doing a little talking to myself too. Carl isn't the real threat to me. Maybe I'm not to him. This isn't two fellows and a girl. This is two fellows, a girl and her husband. I can't fight a shadow, I tried it. Competition's too tough. You were gonna settle for someone you didn't love... ...so you wouldn't be unfaithful to your husband. Oh, you're always so wrong about me. I have a wonderful memory of a husband and a marriage. You're trying to take it away from me. Nobody wants to do that. I don't. I'm sure Carl doesn't. All anybody wants is for you to live in the present... ...and not be afraid of the future. Maybe it can happen again if you quit pretending... ...that something that's dead is still alive. All right, if it'll make you any happier, you're a fortuneteller. You're absolutely right about me all the time. I want everything just the way it is, Mrs. Status Quo. Just me and Timmy, no changes. And I want a girl that'll drop everything and run to me... ...no matter what the score is. Goodbye, Steve. Looks like we're always saying goodbye. Hope you find what you're looking for, Connie. Maybe something you're not. Well, what happened? Seems everybody wants frowzy blonds this year. Guess I'm just not the type. - Did you even put up a fight? - Oh, Carl, please take me home. No little old train's gonna push you around, eh? Oh, fine, this is gonna be in swell shape for me. - Come on. I have to get ready. - It says "Happy New Year. " Oh, your printing's improving, anyway. It won't be New Year's yet for hours. - Where's the party, Russ and Harriet's? - Mm-hm. - Going alone? - Mm-hm. Gee, you don't have any fella anymore, do you? Oh, I've got you, haven't I? Aren't you my fella? Oh, sure, but, heck... ...I'll be running out and getting married pretty soon. Well, I guess someday. Then you'll be alone. I mean, what if I move away? Where are you planning on moving, Cairo or Baghdad? Oh, there's a lot of places. California, for instance. Of course, I'd write you a lot and everything. And I'd come to see you... ...but what I mean is... - I know exactly what you mean. Boy, when you start growing up, you don't waste any time, do you? Mom? What are you thinking about? Well... ...since your plans are all made... ...maybe I ought to start thinking about my future. Come on, young man. You and I have things to do right now.
