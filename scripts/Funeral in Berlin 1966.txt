That was a recording of Mozart's Concerto in A Major played by Viktor Bajevski, the East German virtuoso who yesterday escaped over the Berlin Wall. Escape? They probably paid him to leave. Hold on a minute. ...written in verse on a postcard. - Hello? - Round Robin calling Chaffinch. - Chaffinch, are you receiving me? - What do you want, Chico? Please observe security procedure. On a Saturday morning, are you mad? Bald Eagle wants to see you urgently at his place. Look, he's expecting you at 1200 hours. Tell Ross... I'll be late. - Why try to be so insubordinate? - Why don't you go back to bed? - Shan't be long, Mrs. Mead. - Mrs. Ross? My name's Palmer. Oh, yes, of course. My husband's expecting you. Darling. Your Mr. Palmer. - Morning, sir! - Good afternoon, Palmer. - I'm taking the Bentley. - To the butcher? - Yes, Mini's had a breakdown. - Don't get blood on the coachwork. How can you work for that dreadful man? Loyalty. - I like weeds. - Yes, they're easy to grow. Not at all. You have to keep the flowers out, defend the strong against the weak. A garden should be like a country lane, a place you can walk in. Not with flower beds laid out like a cemetery. I agree. Why did you send for me? - Thistles. - I beg your pardon? I've got a lot of thistles. They attract butterflies. You should see this place in the summertime. Stok...Colonel Stok, KGB. Russian Intelligence, Berlin Sector. In charge of the Wall, unofficially. You've been working since your promotion? - Yes, sir. Well, I want to get on in life. - Yes. - Colonel Stok is thinking of defecting. - Do we want him? Yes, Palmer. Where did you get this dubious information from? - Berlin. Johnnie Vulkan. - Ah, yes. I'll deal with this Monday morning. Your plane leaves at 3:30 this afternoon. Hallam of H.O. will give you a passport. He's at 62 Wallington Road. - Have you ever thought of it, sir? - What? Defecting. I have. - Have you found my cat? - No, you've won the pools. Ah, Ross's little man. Was that meant to be a password, or simply a joke? I didn't recognize you, dear boy, in that gear. - Have you a shilling? - Eh? - For the meter. - I'll see. I seem to have run out again. Thank you. I know I can pay you back. I've got a jar of coppers... somewhere... Somewhere... Never mind, forget it. I came for the passport. - I know, dear boy. Have some tea. - I've got a plane to catch. - You been back long? - Where from? - China. - Is that another joke? Very hush-hush. I hope you appreciate this. One of my lads stayed on till 2 a.m. to get this ready for you. - Dorf? - What's wrong with that? Edmund Dorf? All the best Englishmen have foreign names. Sorry, I don't feel like an Edmund Dorf. Charming. What do you feel like? Rock Hunter. Can't I be Rock Hunter? No, you aren't the type. You'll take what you get. Alright, as long as it's not a useless Foreign Office forgery. I know what you mean. The chap at the F.O. does it with his feet! Have a cup of tea. Darjeeling! No, thanks, I've got to go. Give my love to Berlin! I was there with Monty in '45. So that's why the Germans surrendered! - Yes? - That's mine, that's mine, and this is. Will you open this one, please? They're...samples. They're all samples. - I'm a...salesman. You see? - OK, then. Thank you. - Mr. Dorf? - Yes? On behalf of the company, welcome to Berlin. Can I help? - Did you have a pleasant flight? - Yes. - Harry Palmer, it's good to see you. - You too, you old Kraut. - Yours? - Yeah. This is what you did with your share of the plunder. Nice polish, but getting old. Like you. - She's got a great engine. - How's yours? I keep in shape. By the way, I never thanked you for covering for me on that NAAFI deal. - How did you beat the rap? - I didn't. It was either jail or work for Ross. He thought a crook like me would be wasted inside. He was right. Your idea was brilliant. So brilliant, I'm still on suspended sentence! Her Majesty's Government is doing good business. A cover might as well be profitable. - I won't ask where the profits go. - It's only pocket money. I believe that as much as I believe that crazy Colonel Stok story of yours. He has as much intention of defecting as you. - He convinced me. - Really? You can make up your own mind. I've arranged for you to meet Stok. You're going to the East. - Remember, you're Edmund Dorf. - How can I forget? - You have the address? - Yep. And my Luger pistol, my cyanide pills and my inflatable Batman suit. 59, Marx-Engels-Platz. Neunundfnfzig. Wait here. Me British. You Tarzan. Admit I scared you, English. I'm Colonel Stok. - Good afternoon. - I'm sorry about arresting you. Have some tea. It was a simple device to avoid suspicion. - As usual, there is no milk today. - And so Russian tea was invented. - Alright, Colonel Stok, I'm listening. - You are in a hurry! We must get to know each other, English, if we are to trust each other. I wish to defect. But there are conditions. What do you want? - I want colonel's pay for life. - Don't we all? - A house in the country. - How many bedrooms? It doesn't matter, but I must have a big garden. I'm a peasant at heart and want to grow roses in my old age. In England, roses are out, weeds are in. - Is that all? - That is all. - I want comfort and security. - You've got that in Russia now. In Russia, there is no place for an old Bolshevik. I've made many enemies. What about your family? My wife died in a German air raid in 1941. My only son hasn't written to me in three years. - What would you do? - I'd stop telling lies, for a start. You have no son and your wife is in Kiev with your daughter Katya. I know everything about you. From the size of your refrigerator to the cubic capacity of your mistress. You haven't brought me here just to tell a sob story. Let's stop quarreling, English. - Do you play chess? - Yes. But I prefer a game with more chance of cheating. I like you, English. You're not as stupid as you look. I wanted to see how well you were trained. - Train hard, fight easy. - You quote Marshal Suvorov. Bravo! But my offer is perfectly serious. My wall has been penetrated too many times in the last year. And last week, when a piano player flew over in a bucket... - That's too much! - You mean politically or musically? I did not arrest you for a joke, English. I must go, and soon. Of all people, you should know a way of crossing the Wall. My department is being investigated. I'm being watched! When the axe falls, there's no use pleading not guilty! For you it is a propaganda victory. My name is worth a headline! We get plenty of Russians. It's a pity you're not Chinese. Will you cooperate? Information? Yes, but there are limits. I'm not a traitor. I'm still a good Communist. If you won't have me, I'll go to the Americans. Why don't you go to the Americans? They have more money. Who wants to live in America? They are just Russians in pressed trousers! Revolutionaries gone decadent! Alright, I'll make my report to London. I'll tell them that you talk well and lie badly. - One thing more. - Yes? I must have a foolproof method of escape. Foolproof. Organized by a professional, like Otto Kreutzman. He's organized all the most important escapes. He's responsible for my troubles. Now let him get me out. Good afternoon, Colonel. I've instructed the guards to escort you back. - Worried about me? - Not much. Where have you been? Playing chess. Monica, this is Edmund Dorf. He's English. I like England. England likes you. - She has a friend. - Several, I should think. - Bitte, mein Herr? - No, Lwenbru, please. The Wall doesn't seem to have hurt business at all. We're doing alright. See the man in the plaid jacket? He sells escape stories to editors in the Middle West. The guy with his head in his hands imports Zeiss cameras from the East. They all make a great living out of the Wall. Which one's Kreutzman? - Are you innocent or just stupid? - Stupid. - You don't use his name in there! - Alright. - But can he get Colonel Stok out? - If anyone can. I want to see him. If something goes wrong, you'll end up in the canal. - Would you find him, please? - It'll take time. I'm sorry, I don't understand. Oh, you are English. You took my taxi. I ordered it. Is that all? Well, either you wait for the next taxi... or I will. I'm in no hurry. Thank you. - Where are you going? - To the Am Zoo. Oh, the Kurfrstendamm. It's on my way. I can drop you. Come on. Thank you. What's the beer for? Oh, my hair. It's better ...if you want body. - You with the Press Convention? - No, I'm in underwear. Kinky! I'm in the trade, too. Like it? Looks very expensive. It's murder! I've just been modeling it. - Know anybody in Berlin? - No. I'll take you to a party. My name is Samantha Steel. Some people call me Sam. Edmund Dorf. Some people call me Edna. - Where's the party? - That's later. Don't mind the mess. I'm a terrible slob. That's one thing about living alone. - You can be a... - slob, yes. Fix a drink. I just want to get out of this creation. Take your coat off. The whiskey's by the bookcase. - I like that. - Thank you. - Where did you get it? - Israel. - What were you doing there? - I lived there with my husband. If you can call it living. I was in the army half the time. Oh, I see. What's the matter? Are you anti-Semitic? No, only anti-husband. I left him there. He's in the desert somewhere, making fish ponds. - If you need ice, it's in the fridge. - Thank you. - Do you take ice? - Yes, please. When I'm clean, I'll fix us up some dinner. Inspector Reinhardt. Do you find me physically attractive, irresistible? If you saw me in the street, would you throw yourself at my feet? Corporal Palmer. Oh, ja, I was told about Dorf, but I didn't know it was you. I should have guessed. So crooked, they had to put you in Intelligence. - It was my sex appeal, actually. - Ah. Who thinks you're irresistible? She says her name is Samantha Steel. It means nothing. I'll check if you like. - Aged about 24. - Present address? - 24, Leitzenseeufer. - Lietzenseeufer. She picked me up last night and with my irresistible charm... I wanna know why, and who she's working for. - If I find anything, I'll let you know. - Thanks. Oh, by the way... - Is Otto Rukel still in business? - The housebreaker? Yes. And out of jail? This is a police station, not an employment bureau for criminals. - Is he? - Yes, he is. Go home soon. - Hello? - Sam, this is Edna. Good morning, darling! I can't make lunch, but will you have dinner this evening? - Sounds lovely. - I thought you'd like that. Will you pick me up? Here? - About eight? - Fine. Bye-bye. - Does he suspect you? - Why on earth should he? Come in. Oh, no! You've been burgled! - My pearls. They've gone. - Were they insured? No. They were beautiful. They were my mother's. - And the rest of your jewelry? - It's all junk. - Is there anything else missing? - No. - No. That appears to be all. - Maybe we scared him off. Oh, look at the mess here! I'd like to get my hands on the pig who did this. - Look at all this! - Guess what? We'll have a drink and then I'll help you clear up. Here you are. Otto Rukel, wake up. What have you been doing? I've been waiting for three hours! - Did she hire you to do me as well? - Me? It's an amateur job. The top drawer was opened first. Did you find anything? She gets $300 a week from the Discount Bank in Geneva. She has a US passport in the name of Samantha Steel, an Austrian passport for Anna Stein, an Israeli passport for Hanna Stahl. - Lists of men, names, addresses... - In the wall safe? Ja, in a diary! How much money they have. - Not one less than a million Marks! - Where's the diary? You told me not to take anything. I was photographing when you rang. Where's the film? Where's my money? - Sell the pearls you stole. - What pearls? I took nothing, Harry! - Really, Otto? - On my honor, Harry. Here you are. - Thank you. - Thank you, Otto. Any time, Harry. Kreutzman will be in touch with you tonight. - Meet me at Chez Nous at 11:00. - Chez what? - The Chez Nous. It's a nightclub. - OK. See you. - Hi, Johnnie. - Hello, Ed. Samantha Steel, Johnnie Vulkan. Very happy to meet you, Samantha. Edith, this is Edmund Dorf. I'll just get rid of this. - What's he saying? - He's... Telephone. Hello, Dorf speaking. Follow the man with the green carnation. - We're on. Keep Samantha amused. - OK. See you later, love. Mr. Dorf. Vulkan tells us you want to move a body. - Correct. - Place of origin? Dresden. But we can get him to East Berlin any time you like. - Dead or alive? - Alive. - Willing or unwilling? - Willing. - Conscious? - Yes. - Nationality? - Why not give me a form to fill in? - Who's your client? - That's our business. That affects our price. How old is he? - 65. - You've made a mistake, Mr. Dorf. If he's over 60, he can cross the Wall legally. And you don't need us. Unless he's being watched! That affects our price. 35,000 or $100,000. Half in advance, half on delivery. You're joking! There's an appropriation of $60,000 for this job. Take it or leave it. Very well, 60, if you can give us genuine documents as described here. - Why do you want these? - That's our business. - I'll have to check with London. - Do that. Goodnight, Mr. Dorf. Goodnight, Mr. Kreutzman. Goodnight, Mr. Palmer. - Come on, you'll miss your plane. - Forget it. I've changed my mind. I'll leave tomorrow. I still don't trust that Russian comic. Find Stok and tell him we're moving him tonight. - Tonight? - I'm calling that Russian's bluff. He won't be there, and then perhaps Ross will stop wasting my time. - Where shall I tell him to meet you? - I know. There's been a hitch. It's off for tonight. - Off? - Sorry. It was a trick! You do not believe me. You dare to play games? - You can get us both killed! - I didn't think you'd show up. It does not matter what you think. Your Colonel Ross will decide. Goodnight. Admit I scared you, Russian. The pigeons never come, do they, sir? God preserve us from halfwits! Stok should have sent you to Siberia. If he hadn't turned up, we would have saved 20,000. Yes... I've read your T105. Entertaining, but slightly pornographic. The fact you pick up a girl doesn't make her a spy. It was she who picked me up, sir. You have to say that to get it on expenses, don't you? - There is something else. - What is it? That 800 loan without interest to buy my own car. - Yes. - Yes, I want it or yes, I can have it? Yes, what they say about you is true. Get out of here. Go back to Berlin. I don't care much for Berlin, sir. - You're liable to get shot. - That's what you're paid for, isn't it? Yes, sir. If you're worried, send Babcock in with a chit for a pistol. Oh, thank you very much, sir. Babcock... he wants an armory chit. If he thinks I need a pistol, I need a coffin! I'll be glad to give you one. Who is Samantha Steel? T105s are confidential. Haven't you read the Official Secrets Act? - How was the weather in Berlin? - Cold. I can make it tonight. Not tonight you can't, you're going back to Berlin at 11:00. - Good morning, Alice. 11:00? - Yes. Tickets...expenses... $60,000... for which you have to sign, Mr. Palmer. - They're working on your photos. - And my request for documents? Passed to H.O. Hallam will see you in 20 minutes. Right. Thank you, Chico. Come in. - Hallam? - Ah, Rock Hunter! Come in, dear boy. Here we are, Special Import Licenses. We call all document requests Special Import Licenses. - Very quaint. - I'm very proud of these. Very hush-hush. They match your German's list to a T. He's very lucky. It wasn't easy. I...I seem to have run short of cigarettes. - Do you want a French one? - No. Never mind. Well, where were we...? Birth certificate of one Paul Louis Broum. Inoculation for smallpox. Do you read German? - No, but I do have a plane to catch. - I know you have a plane to catch. Certificate of graduation, commission in the army... Ah, death certificate. We won't need that. - Now, shall we resurrect him? - How long will that take? Patience, dear boy. To this dead Mr. Broum we add one British passport, naturalized. Your client will know how to add the photo and stamp. One driver's license, endorsed. One insurance policy with receipt. Diners Club credit card, current. And what have we got? - A new Broum? - Quite correct. Signature, please. - Rock...Hunter... - Oh, another little joke. Yes. Good day. Passengers for British European Airways flight 684 to Berlin may now board the coach through gate 6. You smoke too much, Chico. - Come into my office. - Bloody things are still wet. Your burglar photographed everything. That's why I took so long. Now, these are her passports: Israeli, Austrian, American. Photostats of everything in her safe, and her diary. Thank you, Round Robin. How come you've picked Paul Louis Broum's documents? - What an extraordinary question. - I said, how come? I started at capital A, then capital A small a, and then Ab, and then Ac. I went on until I found what you needed. Sometimes we start at Z and work backwards, just for fun. Are you sure this fellow's dead? Dead? Of course he's dead. His death certificate says so. Sometimes we start with Z and work backwards, just for fun... Oh, what a lovely surprise. I thought you were still in London. - I have a surprise for you, too. - Oh, am I glad you're back. It's in here. A present? - Pearls? - To replace the ones that were stolen. - Are they real? - They cost a fortune. Well, I'll take better care of these. By the way, darling... Did your burglar find anything in my flat? Nothing much. Did yours find anything in mine? - Yes. - Oh? Your stuff was too innocuous. It was too good to be true. I'll have to put that in my next report. What's your interest in Paul Louis Broum? None at all. Who is he? - He's on our wanted list. - Whose wanted list? - Israeli Intelligence. - Why is that? Because soon, German war criminals will no longer have to face trial. - Broum is dead. - Dead Nazis keep re-emerging! I see, it's the old eye for an eye bit. No. There's a lot of cash in Switzerland that they stole from the Jews. Israel is morally and legally entitled to that money. If we can stop people like Broum getting there first, the Swiss have agreed to hand it over! So you turn out to be a dedicated Zionist! - A fanatic. - Yes, you're absolutely right. - Will you give me those documents? - No. - What do you want them for? - Forget it, I can't give them to you. - Why not? - I came here to do a job. - I hope you're proud of it! - It's a living. Your rotten job and lousy few pounds a week, that's all you care about! I'm explaining all this because I think I'm in love with you. But there are more important things than my personal feelings. Those Broum documents represent over $2,000,000 to us. We want that money. We mean to get those papers, even if we have to kill you for them! Now, get out! Oh, by the way, is old Klaus Berger still alive? - The forger? - Yeah, the forger. I'd like to run you out of Berlin, Palmer. You and Ml5 and the Deuxime Bureau and the CIA and the rest of them. Then I can do my job, not provide work for forgers, thieves and murderers. I agree, I agree, but is old man Klaus still alive? The money? And the documents? You get those with the second payment, on delivery of my client. As you wish. - Is your client still in Dresden? - No, we moved him to East Berlin. - Ready to move at short notice? - Yes. But I must have approval of the details of your plan. - That's our business. - It's our money. Meet me here tomorrow, same time, up on the roof. We've got what we wanted. The operation has begun. - Begun? My client hasn't approved. - He will. My plans never fail, and I personally will supervise. I shall be there from start to finish. - It starts in the East. - And I'll be there. - You can go to East Berlin? - It's only forbidden to West Berliners. I'm not a Berliner. I'm a West German. What's your client's name? That's our business. Contact your client and tell him to exactly follow these instructions. - Ross agreed. - Of course! - You move tomorrow. - You are joking again, English. - Not this time. - Who is doing the job? Kreutzman. If there is a mistake, the Grepos will be shooting at me. That'll be nice. You'll find out what it's like to be an East German. You are insolent! Do you think this job, this loathsome wall, is all I've done for Communism? Does Smolensk mean anything to you, or Stalingrad? I look at your stupid face and I think you mean what you say. I like you. You're good at your job. You need only one thing. - What's that? - A reason for doing it. - I get paid. - 30 a week? Is it worth it? To be a tool of the generals? A tool for making trouble? Trouble makes arms, arms make money... When you get to England, we'll give you a soapbox. - You sure you still want to defect? - I told you, I'm a good Communist! When a man leaves his wife, he remembers his wedding night. Communism was the love of my youth. And I've been faithful. Until now. I was with Antonov-Ovseenko at the storming of the Winter Palace in 1917. - You know what that means in Russia? - Yes, I think so. It means you're an expendable hero. That is good. If I don't like the plan, I won't come. I think it should satisfy you. It's a very expensive funeral. Final payment? He might suffocate while you're counting it. Get him out. - He's pretty quiet in there. - He's alright. We know our business. - You're working yourself to death. - Yeah, well, I'm paying. You bastard, you... You double-crossing English bastard, we'll kill you for this! - Some other time. - You planned this with Stok? It was a plan, but it was Stok's alone. He wanted Kreutzman, and he won. The rest of us are losers. Cover the driver, Johnnie! Get him out of here, you two. Come on. Come on! Look out, Harry! What has he got to do with the Broum documents? Ask him. The driver hit you before I could reach you. I'm sorry. Are you alright? - No. Do you still have some brandy? - Sure. Here. - You won't need stitches. - Oh, good. What are you going to tell London? I don't know. Let's get out of here. I've got some fiction to write. Palmer. Yes? Come with me, both of you. Where to? - We're going to the Villa Grnewald. - Whose party? So you paid 20,000 for Otto Kreutzman in a coffin. Will you wait outside, please, gentlemen? You too, Vulkan. Did they come all this way to interrogate Stok? 20,000 down the drain! I almost saved ten and the Broum documents... Broum documents? Not Paul Louis Broum? There you are. You're doing it again, sir. Not telling me! What is there to tell? You didn't have his name in your T105. It didn't seem important then, did it, sir? - Colonel Ross? - What? I believe that Vulkan is connected with this man Broum. Brilliant, Palmer! Vulkan is this man, Paul Louis Broum. Why do you think I had so much confidence in him? - Blackmail, sir? - Broum was a guard at Belsen. In 1944 he killed a resistance worker named Johnnie Vulkan and took his identity. Under his own name he'd be tried and shot. Do you mean Her Majesty's Government employs ex-Nazis, sir? And thieves, Palmer. - Now, where are those documents? - They've gone, sir. - They've gone, sir. - Yes, sir. If they have gone, that means I have no hold over Vulkan. And I can't let him go to the highest bidder, now can I? No, sir. Well, you've bungled the rest of it. Get rid of him. Pardon? Kill him. I'm not killing anybody in cold blood. Then provoke him, if that's going to satisfy your scruples. Alright, Palmer, you've had your orders. Get on with it. - What's the matter? - Nothing. Stop the car, Johnnie. I have orders to kill you... Paul Louis Broum. What are you going to do about it? Nothing. Ross has been blackmailing me in the same way he blackmails you! - Not quite the same. - All I wanted was my identity back! All you wanted was $2,000,000 that you stole from the Jews! My father had the money! If you'd had the choice, would you be a camp guard, or die on the Russian front? I'm not a judge at a war crimes trial. I don't want to know about it, and I don't want to kill you. Ross'll have this whole city closed by now. - Can you get out of Berlin? - Don't worry about me. I'm not worried about you. I just want you to disappear. If the Jews hadn't fouled me up at the garage, it would've been fine! I'm not interested! Just think yourself lucky you're alive. What are you going to say to Ross? I'll worry about that tomorrow. Thank you. I'll do the same for you someday. You might have to, when Ross decides I'm no use to him any more. English! - What are you doing in West Berlin? - Oh, official business. English, thank you. We've done a good day's work. - The world is well rid of a fascist! - I hope you get another medal. Don't be a bad loser, English. I feel the same way as you do about Kreutzman, but why drag me in it? Only the English or Americans would have hired a man like Kreutzman. - I invite you for lunch. I'm paying! - No, thanks, I'm busy. What's the matter? You in trouble? Ross won't shoot you for failing once. It's not democratic! Colonel Stok, if I need to defect... English, you are welcome. If you need to get out in a hurry, ask Vulkan! He knows the way! Why didn't you tell me you were looking for Broum? I know all about him. Reminds me of the head of my department. Eyes follow you everywhere. What took you so long? I had to get the documents back from the Jews. Why didn't you just steal them? My dear Broum, anything taken from Section 63 must be signed for. It may seem selfish, but if this doesn't work, I'd like to be back at my desk on Monday. - Kreutzman is dead. - Oh? - Who's getting his share? - Never mind that now. I heard from Hoffman, the claim to the money is accepted, except for the proof of my identity. We can be in and out of Switzerland in 24 hours. What's the interest on $2,000,000 over 20 years? These are forgeries. You're lying. Show them to any Swiss banker, he'll laugh in your face. Beautiful forgeries, but on the wrong paper. - But you gave Palmer the real ones? - Of course, dear boy. And that shrewd little Cockney still has them. But don't worry, I'll get them. After all, he doesn't suspect me. Yes, Mr. Dorf? Could I have the envelope you're keeping for me, please? - Thank you. - You're welcome, sir. - You killed him. - Why? You wanted these documents so you could share Broum's money. I told Samantha you and Vulkan were working with Broum. If I came for the documents, why did I bring these? Come in, Johnnie. - What are you doing here? - There's no need to be offensive. You're in very hot water. I've just seen Ross. He told me where you were. You've fallen right on your silly face. Serves you right! Your department doesn't have to account for anything. What do you want? I have authority from Ross to retrieve the documents. I'm on my way home, I shall put them in safekeeping. Where are they? They're in here. Where's Vulkan? Where's Vulkan? He's...leaving Berlin tonight. Let me go, please, it's very painful. He's going over the Wall...into the East. They were going to throw me out. Throw me out. After 25 years! What do you think of that, Mr. Palmer? As a security risk! I never even dreamt of betraying my trust... till I heard they were going to throw me out. Those silly papers. They weren't even secret! They belong to Broum, anyhow. You wanna tell Ross that? No. If you help me, Hallam, I'll try to keep you out of jail. - What's Vulkan's plan? - We were going over the Wall tonight. - Both of you? - Yes. It's an escape route for Stok's agents. The Grepos know about it. From East Berlin we can get to Czechoslovakia, from there to Switzerland. - Where is he? - You go through that house. At the back there's a garden and another building. That's where he's waiting for me. Give these to Vulkan. Tell him I believed your story, and whatever you do, keep him talking. I'll be right behind you. Broum, where are you? He fell for it. I've got the documents. Broum, where are you? I have a gun on you, Harry. Come here! - Where's your gun? - I haven't got one. - I came unarmed. - You're lying, Harry. - Why did you kill Hallam? - Don't pretend you're stupid, Harry. Hallam broke down and told Ross everything. Ross's men are down there now. It's a good try, Harry, but it won't work. Hallam brought me what I needed, and in two minutes, I'll be out of here and over the Wall. Hitting you on the head is getting to be... I told you, Johnnie. Those are Ross's men...
