I only bought him that day, but at the end Of the day, I wanted to wash him because I thought he needed a shower. Shh! Listen First, I made him a little bed in, like, a tissue box, right? With tissue paper and tiny little pillows And then I brought him in to give him a shower... well, a bath pretty much, um I gave him a mm in a shot glass. And I washed his ares um, and then I thought that his head would need to be washed. And he died I drowned him He was dead when he came out of the fucking shot glass. It's true. What age were you? About four or five. Fucking killed him All I was trying m do was give him a bath as well. Washed his head for too long... and he drowned in a shot glass Fucking hell, that is not a nice way to go. Apparently it's peaceful... m drown. Being drowned in a shot glass? Yeah, I'd say he loved n. How do gerbils usually wash? Are you OK? Uh-huh. And I wrote, like, something like, "They were dawdling," and everyone started laughing at me, saying I made up that word. And I was like, "That is definitely a word." You made it up No, it is a word Like, weird shit happens sometimes - Do you know? - Yeah, that... One night when I was going to sleep, my wardrobe opened by itself and all the shit fell out of my wardrobe onto my bed. - Yeah. Yeah, that was weird That would... I wouldn't be able to sleep.
