Yesterday The Fat Man buys a one-way ticket on the Long Island railroad. 19 hours later, Cucumber Frank de Marco takes a bath. It looks like payback time. Excuse me, gentlemen. The place is clean. I don't know, sir. Doesnt add up. You got a beter make on it? The late Karen Lutnick was Tony Russos girlfriend. No shit. Maybe Frank was indiscreet. They don't call him The Cucumber for nothing. Karen was a real dish. Tony finds out Franks eating of his plate. Tonys got a temper. A man gets angry, he gets sloppy. Maybe The Tiger did it himself. - That's murder one. - Two counts. We could hang him. Put me back on 24-hour surveillance. I'll nail Tony for the murders of Frank de Marco and Karen Lutnick. Let us pray for our brother to our Lord Jesus Christ, who said: I am the resurrection and the life. The man who believes in me will live even if he dies. Frank... My baby... - We know that he will raise up... - Such a good boy. We commend our brother to the Lord. May the Lord receive him into his peace and raise up his body on the last day. Amen. - Frank! I'm coming with you! - Mama! Mama, no! Mama! They found them in the tub... naked. - What goes around comes around. - Here she comes. - Youse don't have to clean up. - Angela, sh!

Tony, get up. Get of. Get up! Get in the house. Go on, hurry up! - You all right, Joey? - My nose is bleeding. Let me see that. That's nothing. That's nothing. - Are you OK? - Mm. You two just stay away from each other today, OK? Go on. Thank you so much, Tony. Thank you so much. So, Angela... How are you? How are you holdin up, huh? I don't know... I'm... Yeah, I'm OK.

The key is Angela de Marco. I say we tap her phone, her house, her bedroom. Stake her out. Scope her, tail her, coming and going, and we catch Tony The Tiger with his pants down. Not bad, Downey.
