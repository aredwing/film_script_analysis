HER DAILY ROUTINE -- COFFEE IN THE MORNING FROM WILLY'S, A STROLL THROUGH THE PARK, QUICK PERUSAL AT THE DEPARTMENT STORE BEFORE LUNCH AT HOME." SO, HOW DOES IT FEEL TO BE A GRAMMY-NOMINATED SONGWRITER? I'M STILL IN SHOCK. I KEEP EXPECTING TO WAKE UP FROM THIS DREAM. YET YOU SAID EARLIER THAT I WAS ON YOUR LIST OF THINGS TO DO IN LIFE. YEAH, WELL, IT'S ONE THING TO WISH FOR SOMETHING AND ANOTHER TO ACTUALLY GET IT. AND THIS LIST OF YOURS? IT'S A WISH LIST. A HUNDRED THINGS TO DO IN MY LIFETIME. YOUR LATEST SONGS THAT YOU'VE WRITTEN HAVE BEEN COMPLETELY DIFFERENT FROM YOUR PREVIOUS WORKS, WHICH WERE MUCH DARKER IN TONE. LOOK, I...WRITE WHAT I LIVE. AND ONE DAY, I WOKE UP AND I REALIZED THERE'S NO POINT IN DWELLING IN THE DOOM AND GLOOM. I MEAN, YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE MISERABLE TO MAKE ART. SO IF ART IMITATES LIFE, DOES THAT MEAN THAT THERE'S A LOVE IN YOUR LIFE? PERHAPS. IS THAT A YES? YES. THERE IS A MAN OF MY DREAMS. WELL, IF THIS MAN OF YOUR DREAMS WERE HERE IN THE STUDIO, WHAT WOULD YOU SAY TO HIM? I WOULD SAY... I HOPE WE MEET AGAIN. I HOPE WE MEET AGAIN. "LUCID DREAMS. AN EXPERIENCE WHEN THE DREAMER ISN'T AWARE THAT YOU'RE IN A DREAM. TIPS... GET A DREAM JOURNAL. UPON WAKING, IMMEDIATELY WRITE DOWN YOUR DREAMS BY HAND. THIS WILL REINFORCE RECALL. ANALOG OVER DIGITAL. NAMES HAVE NO MEANING, BU SYMBOLS REMAIN THE SAME." THANK YOU. YOU'RE WELCOME. ALL RIGHT. WHAT DID SHE CALL IT? SHOT IN THE DARK. INTERESTING. YOU'RE TETHERED TO HER. SAY WHAT? WELL, IN THE FIRST "HALO" GAME, YOU WERE TETHERED TO THE HOST. IF YOU GET TOO FAR FROM THEM, YOU WOULD WARP TO WHERE THEY ARE. AND IN YOUR DREAMS, IF YOU GE TOO FAR FROM HER, YOU WAKE UP. SO YOU'RE COMPARING THIS TO A VIDEO GAME. ART IMITATES LIFE. A VIDEO GAME? SERIOUSLY? DON'T GET ME STARTED. DON'T GO THERE. YOUR POINT IS? DOWNLOAD SOME APPS ON YOUR SYSTEM, THEN YOU'RE FREE TO ROAM ON YOUR OWN. YES, NEO. TAKE THE RED PILL. FIND OUT WHERE YOUR DREAMS ARE ACTUALLY HAPPENING. HELLO? GAMER GIRL? UNFORTUNATELY, SHE IS DEAD. SO NO BRAIN ACTIVITY. LOOK, YOUR SUBCONSCIOUS IS CREATING THESE DREAMS BECAUSE I IS DESPERATELY SCREAMING OUT FOR A NEW LIFE, OKAY? A LIFE THAT WE ARE BOTH GONNA HAVE AS SOON AS WE SIGN THE PAPERS AND SELL THIS PLACE, OKAY? I GOT TO GO. HAVE FUN. YEAH. WIFE, KIDS, STUCK ON A LAKE FOR TWO DAYS. DON'T BE JEALOUS. JUST DON'T DO ANYTHING CRAZY UNTIL WE GET THE PAPERS SIGNED, ALL RIGHT? OKAY? OKAY. I DON'T BUY HIS PSYCHOBABBLE. THANKS. I'M GOING OUT FOR A FEW HOURS. YOU THINK YOU CAN HOLD THE SHOP? HMM.

I THINK YOU HAVE ME CONFUSED WITH SOMEONE ELSE. GOOD LUCK. YOU DO KNOW HER, DON'T YOU? OKAY, OKAY. I DIDN'T PAY TAXES ON THE MONEY SHE GAVE ME. GO AHEAD. ARREST ME. LIKE Y'ALL DID WITH VIRGIL. I'M NOT GONNA ARREST YOU. THEN WHAT ARE YOU ASKING ME ABOUT HER FOR? SHE PASSED AWAY RECENTLY. IT WAS A CAR ACCIDENT, AND SHE WAS A FRIEND, AND I WAS WONDERING IF MAYBE YOU COULD TELL ME SOMETHING ABOUT HER. RAY. SHE WAS KIND, GENEROUS. SHE EVEN GOT GERTIE A NEW SET OF WHEELS. THAT WAS HER SPOT. SHE USED TO COME HERE ALL DRESSED DARK. AND THEN ONE DAY, SHE, UH -- SHE STARTED TO LOOK MORE LIKE THIS PICTURE OF YOURS. WHAT DO YOU THINK CHANGED HER? I DON'T KNOW. WHEN'S THE LAST TIME YOU SAW HER? A FEW YEARS AGO. SHE SAID SHE WAS GONNA FLY AROUND THE WORLD. CARPE DIEM. THANKS, WILLY. GOOD LUCK. COFFEE. CROISSANTS. SO WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IS YOU'RE BOTH DREAMING OF EACH OTHER, BUT SHE'S DREAMING OF YOU WHILE SHE'S ALIVE IN THE PAST. RIGHT. WHICH EXPLAINS WHY THINGS LOOK DIFFERENT. 'CAUSE SHE NEVER SAW IT. AND YOU THINK THE DREAM THA YOU HAD THE OTHER NIGHT WAS THE FIRST TIME THAT SHE MET YOU. RIGHT. SO SHE MET YOU AT LEAST A YEAR AND A HALF AGO, WHICH MEANS SHE ALREADY KNEW YOU WHEN SHE CAME IN HERE THE OTHER DAY. OH, MY GOD! THIS IS SO "TIME TRAVELER'S WIFE"! DOESN'T THIS SOUND CRAZY TO YOU? YOU MEAN CRAZY AWESOME?! I WISH THIS WAS HAPPENING TO ME! IT'S TOTALLY KOREAN DRAMA! SO, WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO? I'M JUST GONNA WAIT FOR THE SALE TO GO THROUGH, I GUESS. UH, A WEEK AND A HALF?
