The nany 10 years I endured their unkindness and cruelty. They did not love me, I could not love them. You'll stay there 'till morning. Aunt, no, I cannot endure it. You'll do as you are told. The Reverend Mr. Brocklehurst, Madame. John. Good afternoon, Mr. Brocklehurst. Mrs. Reed. Do come this way. My children. Enchanting. Tea? Perhaps just this once. Pray, be seated. John, dear, would you go and find that wretched girl? Yes, mama. This has been a very difficult decision, Mr. Brocklehurst. Come on! She s going! Hooray! She'll never like it. I can't believe it. Her mother... was my late husband's sister. She married a clergyman, penniless. Then both parents died of typhus when she was a few months old. Are you her only relative? There is... an uncle. Her father's brother. But he lives abroad in... Madeira, I know nothing of him. Go on. I have done what I can for the child, but she has a willful obstinate nature. Ah, here she is. This is Jane Eyre. Jane, this is Mr. Brocklehurst of Lokwood School. How do you do, sir? I hear you are a wicked child, Jane Eyre. Let me examine you. Do you know where the wicked go after death? To Hell. What is Hell? Can you tell me that? A pit full of fire. And should you like to fall into that pit and to burn there forever? No, sir. What must you do to avoid it? Keep well and not die. It is as I said. You must warn her teachers to keep an eye on her, and to guard against her worst fault, her tendency to deceit. Deceit? We do not tolerate that at Lokwood. That's why I wrote to you. I want her to be brought up in a manner befitting her prospects. To be made useful, to be kept humble. And... As for the vacations... I would prefer... if she spent them... with you. Of course. Come. Deceit is a sin. It is akin to falsehood. And all liars shall spend eternity in that lake, burning with brimstone and fire. I m not deceitful. I beg your pardon? I'm not deceitful, and I m not a liar. If I were, I should say I loved you. I do not love you, I dislike you worst of anybody in the world... except your son. Your bags, Jane Eyre. Did you see what a wicked child she is? Have no fear, Mrs. Reed, at Lokwood we shall tame her unruly spirit. The stool. Place this child upon it. You see this... this girl? Her name is Jane Eyre. Be on your guard against her. Avoid her company. Shut her out of your conversations. This girl, take a good look at her, this girl is a liar. Let her stand there all day. She shall have no food. And let no one speak to her. Alice. Pay attention. Back to your lessons. Forgive me, Lord, for Thy dear son, the ill that I this day have done. That with the world, myself and Thee, I, here I sleep, at peace may be. Let her sing. O may my soul on Thee repose, and with sweet sleep mine eyelids close. Sleep that may me more vigorous make to serve my God when I awake. Jane. What? Some bread and cheese. Thank you. What s your name? Helen Burns. Thank you, Helen. God bless you. And you too, Jane. Goodnight. Hands... Bonnet... Shoes. Hands. Bonnet. Bonnet, Jones! Burns, you are on the side of your shoes. Your toes out immediately. Your chin is poking out. Your head up! I will not have you so slovenly. Cover your mouth! Dirty, disagreeable girl. You haven't cleaned your nails. The water was frozen. That is no excuse. Fetch me the birch. Obstinate girl. Nothing will cure you of your slatternly habits. Sorry, Miss Scatcherd. Put it away. Cleanliness... is next to Godliness. Time for your lessons. You destroyed our day now! No one likes you. Go sit down, I'll see you in a minute. Who taught you to draw? I taught myself. I used to look at my Aunt s books and copy the pictures. You draw very well. Not really. You do. You have a gift. You re lucky. Helen. Can I draw a portrait of you? Me? Yes. Take off your bonnet, you have pretty hair. ...seem fit to burden us once more. Who's that girl with red hair? Burns, sir. Helen Burns. Burns, step forward. Vanity. You see this vanity? Long curled hair, masses of red curls. In defiance of our principles. You know that. It was my fault, sir. I told her to take it off. It s not her bonnet. It s her hair, her vanity. It's not vanity, Mr. Brocklehurst. Helen s hair curls naturally. And does she not sin naturally as well? I'm hear teach you discipline. I am here to correct nature, So are you Miss Temple. I'll arrange it so it doesn't offend you. Offending me is not the issue. The child's vanity must be suppressed. Remove far from me vanity and lies. Proverbs. Chapter 30, verse8. Her hair shall be cut off. No! Did someone speak? You'd punish her for the way God made her? Fetch the scissors. You, Jane Eyre. Did you hear? I will not ask you again. Your hair will grow again soon. And if it is cut again, it will grow again. And it will be more beautiful than before. Come, into bed. I'm sure you feel sorry for yourselves. I m sure you all envy other girls who seem to be blessed with happier lives. But you... have all been blessed with intelligence. Intelligence and a proper education will give you independence of spirit, and that is the greatest blessing of all. The only thing that matters in your life is to be in harmony with God. What is this? Come, into bed. Go to bed! Immediately! All of you! Miss Temple! I m worried about Helen Burns. Her cough is worse. Most of them have a cough. I think we should call the doctor. Only Mr. Brocklehurst can do that. Then I shall talk with him. No, Miss Temple. I will. Helen? Jane? Is that you? What are you doing here? Lt's gone eleven. I couldnt sleep 'till I'd seen you. Your feet are bare. Lie down. Cover yourself with my quilt. Don't cry. You mustn't cry. Please don't leave me. We'll be together again. When? Where? be together In Heaven... forever, and always. Will we? Don't you believe that? I don't know. You must believe it, Jane. You must believe... God will take care of us. Goodnight, dearest Jane. Helen! Mr. Brocklehurst. Mr. Brocklehurst. I've found her, sir. Burns. Burns. I'll tend to it. Don't grieve, Jane. She's gone to a better place. May God have mercy on her soul. Come, Jane. Hurry, the coach is here. I hope you don't think I'm ungrateful. Ungrateful, what do you mean? Eversince I've come to Lokwood, you've been my one friend. Apart from Helen. I feel I'm abandoning you. No, no. You mustn't think that. No. It's good and proper for you to start a new life. I wish you could come. Thank you. But... I believe it is God's will I'm here. I cannot leave. God bless you. How much further? If Miss Eyre, who advertised in the Yorkshire Herald last Thursday, is in a position to give satisfactory references as to character and competency, a situation can be offered to her. There is but one pupil, a little girl under ten years of age. The salary is30 pounds per annum. Miss Eyre is requested to send references, name, address and all particulars to Mrs. Fairfax, Thornfield Hall. It'll be nice to get out and stretch. Goodbye, Miss. Goodbye. Goodbye, young lass. Come in, Miss. Come in. Leah! It's the new Governess. Would you follow me, Miss? Mrs. Fairfax. Mrs. Fairfax. Miss Eyre. How do you do, my dear? It s a tedious journey. You must be frozen. Let me help you. Don't trouble yourself. No trouble. Your hands must be numb with cold. Come to the fire and get warm. There. And I dare say a hot drink would be most welcome too. Sugar? No, thank you. Leah, cut a sandwich or two. Do sit down my dear. Thank you. The key. What? The key, Mrs. Fairfax. Here. If Adele is still awake, ask her to come down. Yes, Mrs. Fairfax. The child keeps the most impossible hours. Her mother must have kept her up the entire evening. She isn't your daughter? Oh, no, no. No, her name is Varens... Adele Varens. No, I have no family. I'am glad, I'm so glad you are come. One can feel so isolated here, especially in the winter. It will be most pleasant for me to have someone to converse with on terms of equality. Of course to be sure, John and his wife Leah are very decent people... Here is your charge. Come, Adele. This lady will teach you and make a clever woman of you. My governess? That's right. You may call me Miss Eyre. You speak French! May we speak in French? Yes, Adele, but we're with Mrs. Fairfax now, and in her presence it is more polite, if we try to speak in English. You understand when she runs on like that? Oh yes. Shall I sing? My mama taught be to sing. Where is your mama? Gone. She flew away to the Holy Virgin. She taught me to dance and sing. Shall I sing for you, now? In the morning, Adele. It's late. And it is time you were in bed. Come along. We shall come up and hear your prayers. This way, my dear. Come on, Miss. Thornfield is a fine old hall, perhaps a little neglected, but that could be remedied if Mr. Rochester would come home. Who is Mr. Rochester? Why, he is the Master of this house. But you will never see him. He never stops here. Of course he does, sometimes. He brought you here, didn't he? But it is true, he is usually away. Miss. Will we be very happy? We shall work hard and be content. Goodnight, Adele. Say your prayers. Goodnight, Miss Eyre. Goodnight, Mrs. Fairfax. Goodnight, Adele. I'll not keep you up all night. I m sure you'll want to retire early. And your room is just along here near to Adele. It is small, but I thought you'd like it better than the ones in front. They're larger, but so solitary. No one ever sleeps there. One would almost say if there was a ghost at Thornfield, that would be its haunt. Now, here is your room. This is for me? Why, is anything the matter? Tomorrow I'll discover this is a dream from which I must awaken. We are real, and you are most welcome here, most welcome. Goodnight my dear. Sleep well. Thank you, Mrs. Fairfax. Up here is the main gallery. What a handsome place. I had the windows opened to let in the air. Everything gets so damp in rooms that are seldom entered. Let me show you the rest of the house. Here are the Master's rooms. Is that Mr. Rochester? Oh, no. His father. Why Mr. Rochester keeps it here despite everything, I do not know. One of his strange ways. His father and his brother were very unfair to him. Some would say barbarous. He was the youngest son, you see. And he was expected to sacrifice everything for the family. He only inherited Thornfield nine years ago. When he was a child, he was a gentle boy. He's clearly not barbarous if he's taking care of Adele. Oh, no. No, Mr. Rochester does accept his responsibilities. He's a just and liberal landlord to his tenants. He's well travelled and very intelligent. But when he talks to you, you can't be sure whether he is in jest or in earnest. Whether he is pleased or the contrary. He is not a happy man. Oh my goodness, those flowers! I keep telling Leah that all the rooms must be kept in readiness. Mr. Rochester's visits may be rare, but we are never warned. What was that? One of the servants most likely, Grace Poole. Did you hear it? Oh, yes. I often hear it. She does sewing in one of these rooms. Grace! Too much noise! Remember instructions. We can go back this way. Your arithmetic is not very good, Adele. It's dull. I don't care for it. Why can't we do something else? It's my job to give you a good education. Arithmetic is an important part of that. Mama said it was important to sing and dance. That wasn't dull. If you re good, I'll teach you the piano. Will you? When? Perhaps tomorrow. Why not now? Arithmetic today, piano tomorrow. I'm going for a walk, and when I come back, I want to see how many of those sums you have got right. But they re so difficult. You can do it, I know you can. Are you injured? Can I do anything? You can stand to my side. If you re hurt, I'll fetch help. Thank you. I have no broken bones. Go on then. I cannot leave you here until I see you are able to mount your horse. You should be at home yourself. Where do you come from? There. That house with the battlements? Yes, sir. Whose house is it? Mr. Rochester's. Do you know Mr. Rochester? I have never seen him. What is your position? I'm the Governess. Aah, the Governess. I believe I must ask your help after all. If you'll be so kind. Yes sir. Would you get hold of my horse s bridle and lead him to me? You are not afraid? No, sir. The mountain will never come to Mahomet, so help Mahomet go to the mountain. Would you come here? Excuse me. Necessity compels me to make use of you. Thank you. Would you hand me my hat? And crop. Thank you for your help. Now... make haste home as fast as you can. Whose dog is this? He came with the Master. With whom? The Master. Mr. Rochester. He just arrived. Here is Miss Eyre, sir. I trust the leg more comfortable? Doctor will be here in the morning. Let Miss Eyre be seated. Look what Mr. Rochester has brought me. Have you brought Mademoiselle a present? Did you expect a present? Are you... fond of presents? I hardly know, sir. I have little experience of them. They are thought pleasant. Generally thought so, but what do you think? A present has many faces, has it not? How long have you been in my house? Four months. And you came from? Lokwood School, Lancashire. Lokwood! How long were you there? Ten years. Eight as a pupiI, two as a teacher. You must be tenacious to have survived that place so long. You have the look of another world. When I saw you, I thought of fairy tales and almost asked if you'd bewitched my horse. I'm not sure yet it is she who is responsible for my sprain. There was ice on the road. It caused your horse to slip. Perhaps. I'm not sure yet. Very well, Miss Eyre. I bid you goodnight. Adele. Watch and listen. You mean like this? I have examined Adele. You have taken great pains with her. She's not bright, she's no particular talent, yet she's made much improvement. She's worked hard. You are teaching her piano? Yes, sir. Are you fond of music? Do you play well? I'm very fond of music. I play a little. Like any other English schoolgirl. Perhaps better than some, but not... well. Adele showed me some sketches. She said they were yours. I don t know if they were of your doing... Perhaps some master helped you? No one helped me, sir. That wounds your pride. These pictures must have taken much time. When did you do them? In the last two vacations I spend to Lokwood. Did you copy them? They came out of my head. That head I see now on your shoulders? Yes, sir. Has it other furniture of the same kind within? I think it may have. Better, I hope. Were you happy when you painted them? I couldn't paint what was in my imagination. I always wanted to achieve more. You may have insufficient technique... but the thoughts are magical. Ah, nine o clock. Is Adele in bed? Not yet, sir. She should be in bed. I don't approve of these late hours. See to it, Miss Eyre. I would do the edges darker. His leg is better. He will be going away soon. Perhaps. It will break my heart. It s this one here. Could you draw me his picture? To always have him with me. You examined me, Miss Eyre. Do you think me handsome? No, sir. There is something singular about you. The air of a little nun, quaint, quiet, grave and simple. But when asked a question, or makes a remark to which you are obliged to answer, you rap out a reply which is at least brusque. What do you mean by it? Sir, I was too plain. I beg your pardon. I should have replied that tastes differ. That beauty is of little consequence. Something about that sort. You will endure my surliness without being hurt. Very few masters would trouble themselves to enquire if their employees were offended. You never laugh, Miss Eyre? Never mind. Let me see what my paid employee has been drawing in her sketch book. May I? You have me utterly. No, no, it's mine. Come with me, Miss Eyre. Adele, continue with your work. And remember... shadows are as important as light. Do you believe that? What, sir? That shadows are as important as light? I believe none of us is perfect, I believe none of us is without some fault to hide. You are not naturally austere any more than I'm naturally vicious. I once had a heart full of tender feelings. But fortune has knocked me about. Now I'm as hard and tough as an India rubber ball. You think there is there any hope for me? Hope for what, sir? My being transformed from rubber back to flesh and blood. Come, Pilot. Is all well, my dear? What a strange man! So changeful and abrupt. I suppose I've grown accustomed to it. And one has to make allowances. Why? Partly because it's his nature, and none of us can help our nature. Partly... family troubles. He has no family. There are painful memories which are perhaps best forgotten. Well done, Adele. Is that how mama danced for you? Precisely. Exactly. Now... Off to bed. Fairfax, take her out. Oh no mesieur, let me stay a while longer. Let me dance again. You heard me what I said. Please! Don't argue. Do as you are told. Come, Adele. Come. Well? Treat me as you will, but dont treat a child thus. I will treat her however I see fit. When I look at Adele, I see a miniature of her mother. The same... beauty, the same merciless charm. She was an opera dancer. I was not the first to love her, but she told me that I... was Adele's father. At the time I wanted to believe that. But one night, I found her in the arms of a brainless viscount. I left a bullet in his feeble wing, gave her my purse and ordered heraway. So... perhaps you'll think differently of the child. Perhaps you'll soon be tell me I should look for a new Governess. Adele is not responsible for her mother's faults. Or yours. Or mine? What have I done but play the village idiot? You've made Adele feel unwanted and unloved. Why didn't she leave her in Paris, where she was happy? Because her mother abandoned her. When I looked around I was all she had left. And I do honor my obligations. However they were incurred. No one can deny me that. Goodnight, Miss Eyre. Mr. Rochester! Mr. Rochester, wake up! Wake up, sir, please! Is there a flood? Come on, sir. More water! What happened? I don't know. I heard a strange laugh. Grace. Where are you going? Stay here, don't move. Wrap yourself in my cloak. You're soaked. Grace! Open the door, Grace. It was as I thought. Grace Poole, sir? Quiet so. You should send her away. Say nothing of this business. I will answer for all this. You can go to your room, There s nothing more to fear. Goodnight, sir. What? Are you leaving me? You told me to go. Not in that brief, dry fashion. Not without... taking leave. At least, shake hands. The roses had thorned. You have saved my life. I am in your debt. There is no debt, no obligation. I knew you'd do me good at some time. I saw it in your eyes when I first beheld you. I'm glad I happened to be awake. What s the matter? You re shivering. I'm cold. Cold? You are cold? Yes, sir. Go then, Jane. Go back to bed. You call that clean? You and I are going to have words downstairs. Good morning, Miss Eyre. What happened? The Master was reading last night. He feel asleep with a candle lit and the curtains got on fire. Luckily he woke up in time to put the flames out. Here you are. Hang them. Did nobody hear anything? Did nobody wake up? Perhaps you heard something? Yes, Grace... I did. I heard someone laughing. If I were you, Miss, I'd get in the habit of bolting my door when I went to bed at night. Leah, that's one, and two... Good morning. Oh, Miss Eyre! I supose you've heard about the master's accident? It is a mercy he wasn't burnt in his bed. Leah! Is he all right? Yeah, well enough... to be gone before breakfast. Gone? Gone where? Lord Ingram's, the other side of Millcote. There's quite a party assembled there. Pillows. Do you expect him back tonight? Oh, no. Nor tomorrow night either. When these fashionable people get together, they are in no hurry. They may go to London or the Continent. Mr. Rochester may not be back for a year. He's quite a favourite with the ladies. Miss Blanche has been at him for years. Miss Blanche? Lord Ingram's daughter. Prettiest girl in the county. She is, Miss. Does the Master like her? Oh, yes! He is different when he is with her. So merry and lively you wouldn't know him. Ah, Leah. You are a fool. I'll help you with this sheet. Hurry. They'll be coming soon. James, hurry. Take them to the dining room. My corner to your corner. Ms. Fairfax, have you something we can keep a frog in? A what? A frog. My dear, I have no time for frogs. Mr. Rochester may be here any minute and all of Lord Ingrams friends with him. He's never done this before. They'll bring their maids and theirvalets. In the past he couldn't wait to leave Thornfield, now it seems he's determined to fill the house with guests. They are coming! What? Mademoiselle, the beautiful ladies are coming! Lady Ingram. And Lady Eshton. Yes, and Lady Lynn. And that, of course, is Miss Blanche. This way. Thank you. Do you think Mr. Rochester is in love with Miss Ingram? You shouldn't ask such a question. Why not? Because it's none of our affair. It would be if they got married. Adele, stop this conversation. Go back to your work. I hope he doesn't marry her. A maid told Leah she's only interested in his money. She said he brought back a fortune from Jamaica. Adele! Miss Eyre! Mr. Rochester wants you to bring Adele to the party, and he wants you to stay untiI it is her bedtime. Surely, he doesn't want me to stay? Oh, yes. 'If she objects, tell her it is my particular wish. Those were his very words. Bonsoir Madames. Good evening. What a little puppet! That must be Mr. Rochester's ward. The little French girl. What's your name, child? Adele, madame. So pretty, how charming. Edward, I thought you were not fond of children. Nor am I. What persuaded you to take charge of this little creature? Where did you pick her up? I did not pick her up. She was left on my hands. You should send her to school. Not sure I could afford it, schools are so expensive. You look after her, yourself? We have a Governess. A Governess. Yes, I thought I saw someone with her just now. You can tell a Governess at first glance. They are plain, in a very special way. Aren't they, Mama? Aren't to what, my darling? Governesses. Don't talk to me about Governesses. The very word makes me tremble with rage. I have suffered a martyrdom in their incompetence. What? Nothing. I was said something wrong? She is sitting just behind you. Who is? The Governess. Never mind. It may do her good to hear the truth. Come along... time for dancing. I have been idle long enough. Bianca, will you do me the great honour? I didn't know you were a dancing man. He only dances with me. Who else would I dance with? Mrs. Bennet, will you play for us? Jane! You look pale. Was my dancing so clumsy? No, sir. Come back to the drawing room, it is too early to go to bed. I'm tired, sir. And a little depressed. What about? Tell me! Nothing, sir. I'm not depressed. But you are. A few more words would bring tears to your eyes. I see them there now. Excuse me, sir. I'm very tired. Very well. I'll excuse you tonight, but while my visitors stay, I would like you to appear in the drawing room every evening. It is my wish, Jane, don't ignore it. May I help you, sir? I... I'd like to see Mr. Rochester. We have a house full of guests. Mr. Rochester and I, are old... old friends, and I am very tired. I have come a long way to see him. All the way from Jamaica. May I have your name, sir? Mason... Richard Mason. Peter. Take this gentleman to the tapestry bedroom. Damn your luck, Dent! Anything else, sir? No, thank you. Jane, I need your help. What is it? Come with me. You don't turn sick at the sight of blood? I don't think so. Give me your hand. It won't do to risk your fainting. Here, Jane. There's a sponge on the washstand. Try to stop the bleeding. I'll fetch the doctor. I won't be long. I'll give you half an hour to dress his wound and get him out. Why did you come, why, why on earth? I thought I could do some good. You thought. You thought! She said she'd drain my heart. Keep him at your house untiI he's well. I'll come in a day or two. Have pity on her. Let her be treated tenderly. Let her be... Yes. I do my best. And will continue to do so. It is not her fault. I knowthat. If anyones to blame, it's you. Go. Ace of spades. You have the devil's own luck Rochester. You know what they say. Lucky in cards, unlucky in love. Penny, off you go with the other guests. I'm bored with this game. Why don't we play something else? What would you like to play? Lord Brancaster has a billiard table. You shoud buy one. I adore billiards. They are rather expensive. I'm not sure I could afford one. Does that person want you? Is something wrong? May I speak to you? What is it? I received a letter this morning. Please sir, I wan't leave of absence. Why? An old lady who is sick. What old lady? Her name is Mrs. Reed. She's my aunt. I thought you had no relatives. None that would own me. She cast me off when I was a child. Then why go off to see her? She's dying. I can't ignore her dying wish. You won't be persuaded to stay? No, sir. I will return to Thornfield. So we must say goodbye. Yes, sir. How does one perform that ceremony? Teach me. They say farewell. Or any form they prefer. Farewell, Miss Eyre. For the present. Is that all? Yes, sir. Why don't we shake hands? Remember your promise. Mr. Rivers? Miss Eyre is here. Miss Eyre. St. John Rivers, Rectorof Gateshead. How do you do? Please come in. Your aunt is most anxious to see you. Your family is in trouble. John Reed, your cousin, died last month in London. He died. How? They say, he ruined his health with bad company. It was his deaty that brought on your aunt's illness. This is, my sister, Mary. Mary, I'm taking her to see her aunt. I should be back presently. You are like... Why, you are like... Jane Eyre. I am Jane Eyre. I am very ill. My mind is much troubled by two wrongs I have done you. One... was breaking my promise to my husband... to bring you up as one of my own. The other... Go to my writing case. Take out the letter you find there. Read the letter. Madame, will you have the goodness to send me the address of my niece, Jane Eyre, and to tell me how she is. It is my intention to ask her to come to me at Madeira. As I am unmarried and childless... I wish to adopt her during my life... and bequeath her at my death... whatever I may have to leave. This is dated 3 years ago. Why did he never write to me? I wrote to him... I said I knew nothing about you. Now, act as you please. Write to him... tell him I lied. You were born to be my torment. I am not vindictive. Let us be friends. Love me or hate me as you will. You have my full and free forgiveness. I wish she would come back. Mademoiselle! I thought you'd left for good. I told you I'd come back. You said a week. It's almost a month. Forgive me, Adele. Mr. Rochester is sending me to school. I was afraid I'd be gone and never see you again. To school? To Paris. A school for young ladies. Adele. Tell cook Miss Eyre has returned. Another place at dinner. I'll ask her to make a cake. So, you came back after all? As I promised. As you promised. You are very quiet this evening. What's on your mind? Many things, sir. My aunt's death. Being back at Thornfield. And? Adele tell me you are sending her away to school. Yes. It's a good idea, don't you think? Paris is her home after all. May I ask why, sir? I thought you might have guessed. Perhaps... because you're going to be married. Exactly. Precisely. With your usual acuteness, you have hit the nail on the head. I am to be married. Which means Adele will go to school. You'll need another situation. I will advertise directly... No, you will not. I have heard of a position that might suit you. Governess to 5 daughters of a family in Ireland. It is a long way off. A girl of your sense won t object to the voyage. But the distance... And the sea is a barrier. From what, Jane? From England, sir. And from Thornfield. And... Sometimes I have the strangest feeling about you... Especially when you are near, like now. It is as though I had a string tied here, under my rib, where my heart is. Tightly knotted to you... in a similar fashion. When you go to Ireland, with all that distance between us, I'm afraid this cord will be snapped... and I shall bleed inwardly. But you are sensible. You'll forget. I'll never forget! I wish I had never been born. I wish I'd never come to Thornfield. There are other houses just as fine. How can you be so stupid? How can you be so cruel? I may be poor and plain, but I'm not without feelings. It's not the house, but the life here. I was not trampled on. I was not excluded. I was treated as an equal. And so you are, Jane. And so... And so... Yes, so, sir... And yet not so, for you are a married man. Or as good as married. Let me go. Be still. Don't struggle. You are like a bird clawing at its cage. I'm no caged bird. I'm a free human being, independent, with a will of my own. Then stay. Stay and marry me. How dare you make fun of me? I mean it. Stay at Thornfield. Be my wife. What of Miss Ingram? I don't love her, nor does she love me. Jane, you strange, almost unearthly thing, I love you as my own flesh. I beg of you to marry me. Say Edward, give me my name. Say Edward, I will marry you. Yes. Yes. Yes, Edward. I hardly know what to say. I'm so astonished, I feel I must have been dreaming. I thought Mr. Rochester came in here and said... that in a month's time you were to be his wife. He said the same to me. You know how much I like you, Jane, but... you're so young... and little acquainted with men. I have noticed Mr. Rochester is growing fondness for you... And I have wanted so many times... for your sake, to put you on your guard. Why? There is an old saying... all is not gold that glitters'. And in this case I fear... something different... may be found... from what you or I expect. Is it impossible that Mr. Rochester should have a sincere affection for me? Oh, no, no. It is not that, my dear, it's... He is a proud man. All the Rochesters were proud. And gentlemen in his station are not accustomed to marrying their governesses. Now, then... Let's try the cape on, shall we? There... Turn around. Turn around, dear. Oh, you look beautiful. Have you been to the chapel? Yes sir, the parson just arrived. The carriage? The horses have been harnessed. We'll leave the moment it s over. Yes, sir. Jane! Yes, I'm here. Any regrets? Adele is away at school. She'd have loved to see me in this dress. I will have a portrait painted and sent to her. Like this, with the morning light above you. We are gathered together in the sight of God... to join together this man and this woman in Holy Matrimony. ,... so many as are coupled together but as God's word both allow, are not joined by God... The marriage cannot go on. I declare an impediment. Continue, sir. I cannot. What is the nature of this impediment? Mr. Rochester is a married man. Who are you? My name is Briggs. I'm a lawyer. I was engaged to look after the interests of your wife. There is no wife! 'I affirm and can prove that on the 20th day of October 1829, Edward Fairfax Rochester of Thornfield Hall, was married to my sister, Bertha Antoinetta. A copy of the wedding certificate is now in my possession. Signed, Richard Mason. That proves I have been married, not that the women is still living. She was living three months ago. I have a witness to the fact. Produce him, damn you! Sir, do not forget you are in a sacred place. Have the goodness to step forward, sir. Mason! Close your book. There'll be no wedding. What these men say is true. I have been married... the woman to whom I was married lives still. Come to the house, all of you... and meet Grace Pooles patient... My wife! Stay out of the way, Grace. Be careful, sir. She's a bit snappish. She's seen you, sir, you'd better not stay. We'd better leave. You stay here! This is my wife. Your sister, Mason. Look at her. She is mad. So was her mother. So was her grandmother. Three generations of violent lunacy. I wasn't told about that, was I, Mason? Or I was told about was that my father had made a suitable match to prop up his dwindling fortune and give your family the Rochester name. I did what I was told! And Bertha was kept away from me untiI the wedding. It was cleverly done. Everyone got what they wanted except me. Even she is better off here than she would be in a lunatic asylum... but I have spent the last 15 years in torment. So what I... what I wish to have. This young girl who stands so grave and quiet to the month of Hell. Look at the difference Then judge me! Priest on the gospell and man of the law and remenber with what judgement he judge he Bertha! No, Madame. Hold her down! Keep calm, lass, calm. Hold her, Grace. Take care. Calm, calm, lass. I love you. Say you love me. I love you more than ever. But this is the last time I shall ever say it. I must leave you. Don't leave me, Jane! The horse! Mr. Rochester! Mr. Rochester! The house, sir! Trust me, Bertha, trust me. Leah... John, wheres Mr. Rochester? Mr. Rochester, help me! Help me, somebody! Bertha. Bertha, come close to me, don't be afraid. Come to me. Please, give me your hand. Bertha, come to me. No. I would never harm you. Don't be afraid. Come to me. Please. Come, come on. No! Jane! With no direction or wilth to my future, I travelled to many days At last, as prompted by old memories, I made my way back to home of parson. That once was kind to me. And this is for you! Thank you! Good day to you! Is miss Eyre, isnt it? Do you, remember me? I'm Mary Rivers, the rector's sister. Are you ill? How is she? She's had a good sleep. Now may be a good time to talk to her. How are you feeling? You look better. The doctor is pleased. You should be well enough to come down in a few days. I have been here almost a month. I can't stay here any longer. I must find work and somewhere to live. Hush, be still. You should stay as long as you wish. Don't make her talk any more. Tell her. Miss Eyre. I did not want to excite you beyond your strength, but I have some very surprising news. A gentleman has been here looking for you. A lawyer. I took it upon myself to act on your behalf. A lawyer. What did he want? It seems your uncle in Madeira, John Eyre, has died and has left you his entire estate. He always believed you were alive and he had the greatest faith that one day you would be found. You are his only surviving relative. You have become a wealthy woman. These are the papers relating to your uncle, and the fortune you will inherit. This is your uncle, John Eyre. And this is your father... the father you never knew. How young he looks. And how kind. He was kind. Amongst the papers is the letter he wrote to your uncle announcing your birth. You were deeply loved Miss Eyre. Please forgive me. There is nothing to forgive. I know you have suffered greatly. But the past can no longer harm you. You are safe now. As the months past, my health recovered and my strength returned. The more I knew them, the better I like them. But despite their generosity and kindness my thoughts were constantly drawn back to the past. The places and people I could not forget. Jane! Jane! You have been with us now for nearly six months and in that time I have come to respect you and to admire you very much. I don't expect you to love me, now, undobtedly enough of love would follow upon marriage to render the union even right in your eyes. All I'm asking you for is your affection, your care, your companionship. You have all those things. Jane! What I'm offering you is trustworthy and good, it is real it is lasting. I'm very touched by what you say, but I cannot decide now. You must give me time to think. Of course! But however I decide, I shall give part of my inheritance to benefit the girls at Lokwood school. And, please, I want you to take whatever you need for your mission in rework. Would you arrange it for me? Mrs. Fairfax? Pilot. Hello, Pilot. Pilot! Pilot! No more noise. Miss Eyre! Mrs. Fairfax, bring me a glass of water. Who's there? Who is it? Pilot knows me. My brain will burst. What delusion is this? What sweet madness! Her fingers. Her very fingers. Jane Eyre. Jane Eyre. So many times I've dreamed of this moment. Then the dream vanishes and flies away. Gentle dream. Kiss me before you go. I shall never leave you. You will stay with me? How? I will be your friend, your nurse, your companion. You will not be left alone for so long as shall I live. I'm no better than a ruined tree. I'm lightning struck and decayed. You are no ruin, sir. You are vigorous and full of life. Plants will grow and wind around you, because your strength offers them so safe a hold. And so I married him. Slowly but surely, Edward began to recover his sight. And when our first born was put into his arms, he could see that our child had inherited his eyes as they once were, large and brilliant and shining with life. We sent for Adele, she now lives with us, as beloved as if she was our own dear daughter. We are truly devoted, my Edward and I. Our hearts beat as one. Our happiness is complete.
