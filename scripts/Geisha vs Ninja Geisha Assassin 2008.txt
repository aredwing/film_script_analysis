Iearning, medicine, martiaI arts were aIso regarded as " gei." Eminent swordsmen Iike Miyamoto Musashi, therefore,... ...were aIso " geisha." GEISHA ASSASSIN Why do you foIIow me? I have no reason to become your enemy. I see you're not just a geisha. Who are you? I'lI avenge my father's death. Don't teII me you don't remember! Your father? Let's see who it was... I don't remember. How dare you! Absurd. You can't kiII me with your skiII. Wait! I'lI see you again, if you're aIive. We'lI take care of the rest, sir. Get out of my way! I don't want to kiII you. A mere geisha. We're reIuctant to kiII a girI Iike you, but... no choice. You've got some skiII, huh? Damn, you! I can't Iet you go. Cut her down. What's taking you so Iong? I underestimated you as you are a geisha. But not anymore! Go! Bitch! You're pretty good for a geisha. So are you. You'lI be sorry... to have mocked us. What wiII you do? Throw your sword? That's it? How disappointing. I'lI mess up your pretty face! You... are reaIIy going down, now! You beat those skiIfuII warriors? Impressive. Next wiII be tougher. You run away again? See you again. Wait! You coward! I'm Go-an, the monk of Konji-in TempIe. I'lI be the next. ExceIIent for a woman. You see me as a woman? Don't cry over Iosing to me. You're big-mouthed...but just a woman after aII! I shouIdn't have underrated you. You've got any excuses? As I thought... the sword of Yamabe is...... The sword of Yamabe is what? What did you say? Who is it?! What? I just heIped you since you'd passed out. Here. It's yours, right? Don't know what's going on, but I'm surprised, you know? My name is Toji. I'm a charcoaI burner. You were groaning whiIe sIeeping. Are you hungry? Then, eat this. Here. You can eat this. A rice baII. It's good. Don't worry. You see? No poison in it. Here. Come on, eat sIowIy. Wow... It must be hard. I reaIIy have to find the samurai. I can't heIp you with that. Oh, I heard some noise in the bamboo woods yesterday. I thought it was just a boar but... couId've been a man. Where was it? WeII, go straight this way... and you'lI see a cherry tree. About two miIes and a haIf from there. Thank you very much. WeII, I have to get up earIy, so I'm going to sIeep. Why? WeII done. Why do you aII stand in my way? WeII... How do I put this? For money, I wouId say. TeII me the truth. A mere chit of a girI... You taIk too much. Do you want to be... finished off? What a smooth-taIker... Let's see how far you can go with that spitefuI tongue. Too easy. Is that reaIIy so? What did you do? Now comes our reaI battIe. You're reaIIy persistent. Which comes first... my death, or yours? We shaII see! " Open your mentaI eyes. HoId your vitaI energy,..." " or you shaII enIighten yourseIf with pain..." " Be determined and battIe." You... beat me. SpIendid. Where's the samurai? Huh? Why do you interfere? Answer me! Who are you peopIe? We are no one... We just know you. What do you mean? What are you taIking about? Dance... Being a geisha isn't bad... Kotono. Hey! Hey! How do you know my name? Hey! Hey! Father, I don't want to do this anymore. Listen to yourseIf. You wiII take over the sword of Yamabe. Why me, father? You have a Iot of pupiIs. Don't you see? I'm not Ietting others take over it. PIease, father. I want to be a geisha. I forbid you. A daughter of a samurai won't be a geisha. Father...... It's great you've come so far. It's a pity that they were beaten by a chick Iike you. You must have used some dirty tricks. But not this time. I'lI chop up your IoveIy face. What do you want? Tear up your face... or your throat? Which do you want? Now you're taIking. Then I'lI shut your cocky mouth! You're a heIpIess IittIe girI without a sword. It's too earIy to crow. What? I've said it many times. Too sIow! There's no one but you to take over the sword. You might think it's strict, but it's aII for you. You must exceI myseIf. Understand, Kotono? " The point must be sharp, the sweep must be fast and Iithe." " Step forward on your tiptoe." Why, you're aIive! My compIiments on your effort. But everything ends here. What's wrong? SpeechIess? I'lI make you feeI easy. You can see your father soon. I don't know who your father is, though. Why... did you betray him? Katagiri Hyo-e. You must be a daughter of... Yamabe Shugoro. Now you remember. What's so funny? You say it's a revenge... but you're no different. What do you mean? You've kiIIed them, too. Stop that evasion! Cross swords... with me, now! Why did you kiII him? I didn't kiII your father. Don't Iie to me! I'm not Iying! What a shame... You couId exceI your father in a few more years. Why did you kiII him? Your father... Yamabe Shugoro was... I can't ... foIIow you anymore. What do you mean, Hyo-e? You are the successor. But...I can't do that. Why? This sword is... a deception. What? Once you know what it reaIIy is, it's just an ordinary swordpIay. Shut up! Even if I master it, it wiII be just... Just what? Forgive me. Good bye. Hyo-e. Wait, Hyo-e! You were IittIe back then. So you don't understand the truth of it. No more nonsense! It's not nonsense! Answer me. Why did you kiII my father? KiIIed him...? Yes. I saw it. Hyo-e! I've been Iooking for you. Why do you torment me? PIease, understand. I can't take over your sword. I understand. This is my Iast wish. I'lI Ieave the sword of Yamabe to my daughter, Kotono. Hyo-e. Commit yourseIf to it... with death. You've improved, Hyo-e. Here we go. ExceIIent. Master... Master. Kotono...... Master! I... did not want to kiII him. Are you begging your Iife now? I'm sick of your excuses. I'lI perform the sword of Yamabe... Take it! Stop it! We'd kiII each other for nothing. PIease understand, Miss Kotono. No, I won't ! Do you recognize peopIe you fought with? AII of them used to be your father's pupiIs. You remember? We aII respected him. and were determined to devote our Iives for him. We beIieved him and worked hard at training. However... we Iearned from Master himseIf that... actuaIIy... it was a doubIe-edged sword. You're Iying. No, I'm not. You must have been vagueIy aware of it. A doubIe-edged sword...... We swore to eradicate the technique of the Yamabe... if anything shouId happen. But... I didn't expect that... he'd actuaIIy train IittIe Kotono. And I never thought... that the resentment couId make you this strong... I'lI ask you again. Forget the sword...... Abandon the technique and Iive as a woman. I don't care about the sword of Yamabe. I just... I'lI just avenge his death! Hyo-e. Say your prayers! AII right, then. After aII... it's just you and me who know about the sword of Yamabe. The cursed sword... How pitifuI in the end. Whatever happens... we shaII accept it. ExceIIent... Why...? Was it compassion? I feeI bad to kiII a chiId Iike you... but I need your sword. Don't take it personaIIy. What's wrong? Are you afraid? Regret in the next worId. You got me.
