I think he'll retire without doing any job. Sir... please, offer me this job sir How long can I work in departmental stores & petrol bunks? I feel ashamed to be jobless. I beg you sir. Are you begging here? Look at your face. Bloody pushcart salesman. Get out. Make a living as a porter. Who allowed you inside? I'll come with biscuit, next time. What a great office! Street dog is conducting interviews. I heard your wife has eloped with your driver. People are saying. This job suits you well. Ganesh, I got a job. I went for police selections. I got selected as a constable. Ganesh, come. What a nasty coffee he made. I'll not go to school. - If you don't, you'll end up like him. Attending interview again? You'll never come good in life. Bloody wastrel! Are you dodging me to repay the loan? I'll see your end. Ganesh! Attending an interview again? Stop boy! Get me a pack of cigarettes. I'll give you 25 paise. I can forget if I drink, but it'll not allow me... If I forget, I can drink, but I can't forget... Heart is like this only... Man's life is like this only... A man with heart can never live in peace... I warned him a lot but he didn't listen to me. I don't want to go home, father will shout at me. Instead of seeing him, I prefer sleeping on road. Uncle, Ganesh too is starving. Bloody! Cheap drink, even buttermilk isn't working on it. Would you like to have buttermilk? If you don't want, forget it. I saw Dosas near my bed, did Vasu left them for me? I need Rs.100, for application. I don't have. Don't lie. Okay, I won't give you. - Why? It's my money. My wish. Am I not watching that channel? My TV Will any man live in this house? Who said you're a man? Am I a dog then? A dog follows the order's loyally. I'll get a job someday. - Only fools dream. What the hell did you achieve in life? For 30 years the same teacher's job without any change. Are you advising me about life? I am bearing you for 30 years. Isn't that a great achievement? The brief you're wearing isn't earned by you. Men of your age have studied well, Got married, living happily with kids. What about you? You're still licking my ass. A son is one who takes care of aged old parent. Not one who lives all his life on father's old shoulders Thank God! I have a job for decent living. If not you would've killed me long back. My sight has diminished. I'm not able to stand for more than 10 minutes. I'm coughing all the night. Do you know how many times, I'm visiting hospital in a week? Sons like you are useful only to cremate parents. Take... Rs.100 Buy application... or buy drinks or go to a prostitute. What are you looking at? Will you die if I touch you? Are you going to office? - Yes. Go... Slow... slowly. What happened to me today? What's this new commotion in my heart? Shining garland of clouds... As rain drops are showering... Seeing my lover's beauty... Why am I sweating? Which sculptor's master piece is this statue? Her beauty is all new to me... Her beauty is making my eyes to forget to bat... A new strange passion is taking over me... Unforgettable magic... Feeling very thirsty in pouring rain... A rainbow has descended on earth in gentle rain... It lost sheen seeing her luminous beauty... Her beauty is pulling me towards her... Ever since then my legs are following her only... When a dawn is visiting at midnight before me... My mischievous eyes broke into a joy... Rain drops are getting wet and dancing happily... My heart broke into a song happily... My body danced in a trance... When I see her beauty... I'm sleepless... When she sees me, my heart can't take the thrill... She spellbound me with her gentle mischievous smile... Jas the crescent moon bloomed from her sensational curves? I stood before my eyes like a dream... I forgot the world as my dream came true... First time I saw a lightning... I rushed & gushed towards her like a sea on high tide... What's this? Is the world coming to an end? I'll come... I'll come fast... I've to study now. Are you coming? Where? Are you drunk? My study... God! Have you made him go mad now? I'm going in because you showed me the way. Your wish. Isn't her speech sensational? No... always like this only. I feel like I know everything, but I can't remember it. Think peacefully without tension Excuse me. God is there. How you had chided me? You said I can't buy my own brief. Now, I've passed the written test. Is he calling me to make fun? What? What happened? It seems my son has passed the written test. Still he has to pass group discussion & interview. He'll never make it. Do I've to speak in English? Can't I speak in Telugu? I'm not good in English. - Did I ask you? You speak. Say something other than yeah! What's your problem? I'm not fluent in English. Then, speak in Telugu. It's important to tell your views in a group not the language. Is it insult to speak in Telugu? We are all Telugu speaking people. Okay go ahead. You've courage, don't you? Many speakers here belittled India economy What happened? It seems he has passed the group discussion too. He called me there as he's feeling nervous. Will he get the job if I go there? How many more tests? Anyway, you'll fail again there. It's routine for you. Why to waste time here? Come let's go home. Will you shut your gob? - Give me respect. Why did you call me here then? - Who asked you to come here? You said you'll feel better if there's any companion. I said any companion not you. I must beat myself with slippers for coming here leaving my work. Sorry, you're wearing shoes today. Stop. Say hello to her. Why are you just watching here? She's going away. Come on say. Did he really pass two tests? Madam... that's... you please carry on... Why are you so elated? Were you sure I'm useless? I did feel like all these days. Did you ever get yourself a job? Suddenly when I heard you passed a test with software solutions...- You... I don't know whether I'll get the job or not. But I shouldn't see you here when I come out. I saw your lousy face. I'll not get this job. Not selected, right? Forget it. It's a great achievement that you've come so far. Come. Father. I got the job father. I'm not a useless man anymore. Come let's have a coffee. This way. You go. Starting salary is Rs.15000, in a year, it'll be Rs.25000. They will send me abroad also for training. At last, after years of wait... I must buy a good watch. You retire immediately father. Take rest at house. Why do you want to work? Stop the bike. Stop the bike. What did you say? - Are you mad, dad? I'm not mad, you've grown bigger to your boots. I expected this from you as soon as you get a job. Should I retire? Should I sit at home? Become your maid servant, cooking, washing & serving you. Even to buy a medicine or biscuit I've to beg you. I'll never depend on anyone. I'll live on my own. I'll never ask anyone. If a situation comes like that, I'll kill myself. You're not talking to me again. Relationship of father and son is snapped from this moment. Go... go away. What did I say now to make you so furious? I said like that to comfort you at this old age. Again same words. - Why are you taking serious? I'll kill you... stop... stop. Why is he sleeping so early? Wake him up. Get up... get up... Vasu... - What's it. I got a job. I got a job... I'm unable to bear the torture of beggars early in the morning. Oh Lord Vinayaka! Is it office or some hermitage? What's that forehead full of designs? God! - Who is working here, you or God? Wipe it away. You look like a sorcerer. Trying to cheat the world with disguises. Come. What's this man? Can't you come to office on first day after visiting a temple? Look at the clean forehead. I too told him the same. Ask Keerthi to train him He's God. He gave me Keerthi! She's a different kind. Come. Have you forgotten me? On the interview day... Was it you who spoke in Telugu in the group discussion? Remember me? You helped me a lot that day... I said like that to help you a little. But from now onwards only English will do here. Ask me if you've any doubt. Why are you still standing here? This isn't a school to start from alphabets. Why this torture has been assigned to me? Why do you unnecessarily get shouted by her? I can't understand anything. She has no patience. I fear she may beat me in anger. It seems she's the most strict officer here. And you got struck with her. Take this basic study material. Be careful. I must get the books back next week. If you damage any book... Take an auto to home. Ramu, you go. Can't you tell before starting? Madam! Are you always like this only? Long faced. You can smile at times. Nothing... you carry on. This isn't office it's road, you're not my trainer here. This is a free country. I can say anything freely. Smile sometimes. It's good for health. Come on say bye to me. Did she see me? Did she really see me? Did she look at me? Did she? Did she see or was it hallucination? I feel like trains are chugging in & out of my heart. She'll not look at me. Bloody, I can never understand this. What happened? Why did you allot him project without proper training? Is it a playground to play as you wish? If you don't like doing job, stay at home. I've to deliver it by tomorrow. You go. That's all. Do you've to cry for such silly things? Please smile at least now. It's always good to health. Watch! I think you're going to smile. It's coming. Giving life to my heart... Gifting your heart to me... Sharing your love with me... Building a bridge to my youth... Opening the door of love to me... Opening the room of my heart... spreading a bed... You are presiding there forgetting the world... Your looks make the sun to freeze... Your touch will make the moon to sweat... For your free & frankness... For your affection... I'm in a world of illusion... Withered leaves turned into flowers when you walk on them... Even crows turned into poets seeing your beauty... For your dreams... For your tales... It's happiness all over... Praising me beautifully... Asking me something later... You've created ripples in my serene pond like heart... Talk to me a word affectionately... Walk a step with me... It'll be a cherished memory for all my next 10 births... I must take refuge at least once in your lap... Sleep on your heart once... I can spend my life happily with these sweet memories... I've noticed your desires... I've recognized your anxiety... Unable to decide... Unable to answer you... I'm watching you silently... How was I earlier? She took me to the top. You must meet her. You'll die in jealousy. I'll get the best wife amongst us. Watch it. Her hostel number. You must call & tell her. That Ganesh loves you very much. Your name is written all over his room. Then, if you say no, he'll die. His heart is throbbing for you only, tell her everything. And ask if she too loves me. She'll definitely say no. Don't leave her till she accepts my love. One more important thing Tell her I don't know anything about this phone call. Do you want to escape making us scapegoats? No, I've to adjust now for further problems. Coins! You go on talk to her, I'll insert coins continuously. I've auditing in my office, I'll take leave. Bye. I'm down with dysentery. I've to consult doctor. Bye. - Bye. If you don't call her now on phone, I'll never see you guys again. Ganesh, try to understand us. This is a matter of your life. I can talk any nonsense. Seenu is a brave man. He has good rapport with girls. Your love will succeed. Man! He's our friend. Take care of him. We must help him. Bye buddy. I really have urgent work, bye. You stay. Is she coming? Keep your hand steady. We'll deliver it at home. Why did you say bank? I'm scared buddy. I can't do it. I'll be embarrassed if this leaks out. A police in criminal act. They will spit on my face. No need of all this, come. I don't know how you do it, you must tell her. My brain is heated. If you don't tell her, I'll kill you. Keerthi, phone for you again Hello, I'm Ganesh speaking. I'm Ganesh's friend Seenu speaking. Oh! I told her my name. He loves me. No... he loves you. If you refuse, I'll die. No... no... he'll die. Next... next... what next? He has written your name all over his room. I don't know anything about this phone call. No... you don't know. Oh my God! Actually Ganesh doesn't know anything about this phone call. I haven't seen him for a month. In fact I don't know him. Tell me whether you love him or not? Then... I'm not a policeman, I'm a beggar in Railway station. Ganesh loves me? - Yes. Thank God! That's it. She got the message, Ganesh. No... Naresh... Mahesh... Suresh... If he has courage, tell him to express his love to me. Tell bravely. Okay. I'll tell her. Do you've a friend named Seenu? Oh no... No... I don't have any friend? In fact I don't have friends. What was the name you said? Seenu? Seenu? What a lousy name? Nobody will befriend such a man. Where were you last night? Last night? I slept off after reaching house from office. No... I got news about my grandpa's death. I went to my native place... I wasn't in Hyderabad at all... Some one used your name and made a silly phone call. Be careful. Who is that bastard? I'll kill him. You told me, right? I'll take care. By the way... what did he say on the phone? He said you've gone mad and taking you to mental asylum. Did he say that? - Then, you've to go to Australia for a new project. 3 others have been selected with you. Who are the 3? You, Balu sir and Daniel. - No I'll not go. How can I leave you and...

Please, I'll also come. Take me with you. Just now you said you can't leave all these people behind. Why can't I? Bloody useless people. I can live as long as possible. Don't go overboard. You'll fall flat on face. Jealousy! Master! Till now you'd worked for so many years Did you ever cross Hyderabad? You know the spelling? Ganesh, for Rs.2000, you can. Rs.2000? It's unjust. Take Rs.1000. If you can't, leave it. Many others are in the queue.. Is it a joke to sit next to Keerthi? One day, one night, Keerthi next to you. How lucky one must be to enjoy it? You can't. People are offering Rs.5000 or Rs.10000. Leave me. Take it. - Respect for me is diminishing. Aren't you talking mercy? Come kiddo, Balu. God save me You next to me? Fasten the best. - I've already fastened it. Look Not the pant belt, fasten seat belt. Never boarded a flight before? I'm seeing a flight for the first time in my life. Oh God! How do people drink this? I had to do all this for Satan Balu. Balu, have it. Why are you feeling shy now? I can't understand Indian English and you're too much. Wherever you go, same men, same behavior. Hey kiddo! Come here. You ask. - How can I ask her? He'll ask. Tell her. We come rarely to foreign country. Shouldn't we see the places? No use of going to hotel room now Where shall we go then? You go to the hotel. Don't take risk. We'll look around. If anything happens to you, I'm responsible for it. I'm coming with you. Tell me the truth, where are you going? Balu sir suggested a club. - Which club? No... they are young men, for an evening of fun... I'm also a young woman, ain't I? Come, I'll also have fun along with you. Please don't say no. Let's enjoy for few minutes. Hello! Stop acting, you too join the crowd to enjoy fun. I'm not interested. - Why? Leave it. - Come out. A man in love will not feel like seeing all this. He sees his lover in any woman. How can he? Do you see your lover in them? Yes, what a great dancer she is! Enough! What are you drinking. - Orange juice. Order a juice for me. - That is... Who is your lover? You! - What? I mean a girl like you. Same height, same weight, same face. Everything same!

I'm leaving. Will you lock the door and sleep? I'll go out. What should I do then? You sleep here. There. You mustn't come here. I'll kill you. You can remember this very well. I want to sleep. If you go away, I'll also go out. You... What are you doing in my room? You're in a towel. My dress. Night dress Where is my dress? Look... nothing has happened as you're imagining. You had drinks and threw up. So I had to clean & stay back. Don't you remember anything that happened last night? Who are you to do change my dress? I didn't change but a lady worker did it sending me out. Inquire if you've doubt. Couldn't you go out after that? Why did you stay in the room? You will ask now. You forced me stay here only. You'll say like that. Did I ask you to stay in my room? Don't lie. Look, you slept like a log. I was here like a security as guard. Believe it or not. Your wish My girl's eyes have a net of charm... Her wet lips are inviting to be it's companion... Her tender waist is sensuously moving towards me... You're man's pride... it's killing me with desire... Pinch my cheeks... Be guest on my bed... Don't lure and trap me with your sensuous beauty... If I lose control, your youth will get devastated. If you're such a macho man, why don't you come with me? Come fast... take me in your arms...

I'll be happy if I get what I wish for... Please... in an emotion... Please don't mistake me. I wanted to express it well. I'm not qualified to love you. But I'll take good care of you. If you become wife. How am I to tell you? I'm getting married next month. No jokes please I'm telling you truth. Invitations are also ready. I was about to invite you. Please don't make fun of me. Just now my life seems getting better. I shudder to think also. You must love me. - Don't talk like a mad man. What do you know about me? You've just seen one part me only. All this you see is a mask, I wore for my job. But situation of my family is totally different Very strict If my grandfather comes to know this, he'll kill me I can't accept love... ...why am I telling you all this? Leave me alone.

He's here... he's talking to Keerthi madam. I mustn't praise my own son. Though he may look mischievous, he's very good man. I never saw him chasing a girl. First time he has fallen in love with you only. He's love for you is not ordinary, he loves you very much. Love! How would I know all this? He's sitting at home and crying What's the use of me, if I don't help my son? I don't know what had transpired between you both, You both are modern youth. If you've any idea about him, tell me. I'll talk to your parents. - Don't you've any sense? How can you talk like this to a stranger? Aren't you ashamed? Your son did a mistake. How could you support him at this age? If you trouble me again, I'll report to police. Your son had earlier took me into his arms in public... Do you know what's the gossip going around in my office? You both know very well my marriage is fixed. Are you humans or...? Your son fell short by 2 marks in the interview... I felt pity and got him this job. Is it the way both father & son show the gratitude? What's this? He asked you out of affection on me. He's an elderly man. Can't you explain him patiently? Why are you shouting at him? Should I watch mutely your irresponsible behavior? This foolish man... I'll not take one more harsh word against him. I have been watching you, wagging your tongue. Tell me truthfully. Don't you know that I'm following you all these days? Don't you know how I was admiring you? You can know a man seeing even from a mile away. Why this hypocrisy knowing everything? If you don't like me, say it openly. Or say he's an American, and I'm a status less local. Why create a scene here? Let the fight be within us. Say sorry to him. One more word and I'll burn your face with acid. ...say sorry to him What's this? - Father! I'll kill you. Ganesh, don't get angry. Listen to me... All are watching us.

I don't mind going to jail killing her. Did she slap me? In that commotion her hand hit my face. You think from her side. Yesterday son and today father Who will not get angry if we pester her to love you? Why are you supporting her? She's a good girl I can judge by looking at her. Won't you eat anything?

People are ready to give their daughters in marriage to me even now. Okay... come. Do you've such ideas at this age? Are you still feeling sad, son? No father. You had to face all this for me. Yes dad You got so furious on seeing me getting slapped. Do you love me so much? Why are you asking me that? Okay then, don't tell me. Leave it. Suddenly when you asked... - I asked casually.

How long will you be like this? Do you also want to die? Give it to me. Eat... eat... Eat... Eat... I've to go to my native place urgently. Some land problem. Moreover my marriage. How can I leave him alone here? He may go completely mad. I'll take him to my house. Your house is too small, it'll be difficult. Will you come with me to my native place? Stay away from Hyderabad for few days. Mine is a large family. With paternal uncles, we are about 30 people. Change will be good for you. Go with him. You'll get peace. Take care of him. I'll come as soon as I get leave. - Okay. What? I don't see Keerthi, may be she has boarded another coach. Get in... be careful... take good care of him. Give me your hand... come in...

I want you to live peacefully away from Hyderabad. You're acting high... come. What? - Come here for a moment. Wait... I'll come. - Come, I say. Come... one more word... I'll not consider our friendship too. Come... leave the bag... come. Why is he here? - Do you know him? No... but... you know about our family It'll create problem. Why is everyone talking about problem? I'll take care of it. His father died suddenly. He was the only close relation he had. He's devastated. If I leave him, he'll go mad. What happened? When did his father die? - 4 days ago. Poor man died of heart attack. You're the heaven in eyes... You're the hell in heart... You're the sweetness of world... You're the poison in neck... You're my sad story of my love... my dear... You're my lovely pain... You're my lullaby of love, my dear... You're the lava in my heart... You became flower and spread fragrance... You turned into a thorn and pricked my heart... You spread light in life like a lightning... You buried my dreams striking like a thunder... Is love a journey of tears? Is trouble the destination of love? Love warned me not to enter its world of destruction... But still foolishly I stepped into it's realm... And paid a heavy price for it. You encouraged me... Later you discouraged me... When I sought refuge in you... You smashed my world... My body was hidden safely like in a temple... But Goddess' garland has become a noose to me... I lost faith in love... I want to go to a world devoid of love... I must reach a place you can never even dream of... You said a large family. But I don't see anyone here. My grandfather is of olden times. He's God to this place. We abide by his rule and live for generations as a joint family. Our grandpa decided our marriage after college studies. They fixed the date and started making arrangements too. We didn't want to marry so early. We wished to reach top in our respective jobs. We tried hard to convince grandpa but he didn't listen. He said he'll think of it after marriage. So, we ran away from home just days before marriage. I rented a room and she joined a hostel... We took up jobs. Everyone at house accepted us. But grandpa stopped talking to us since then. He didn't worry much about me. But he dotes her. She lost her mother at birth. So, grandpa and all others took special care for her. We came here last year too. Grandpa didn't enter house till we were here. This marriage is too cool his temper. I think this will cool him. Why didn't you introduce her to me? How many times should I ask her? She decided not to meet any of my friend. She thinks she's very intelligent. She gets angry if I go to meet her. How can I take you with me? Look! Who is coming? Old man is coming. I'll inform the villagers about it. Grandpa! Go...seek his blessings... you too go. Why are they seeking my blessings? Tell them their foolish grandpa is dead. Why those harsh words? Be happy for their achievements. I don't need to learn how to be happy from you. Is it? Who is he? Grandpa! He's my friend. Few days... Few days? - To stay here for few days... You don't have a place here and you've a guest with you. Look at him. He's like a beggar. Tell him not to come before me. - Okay. He's too much. - Please bear it for me. She's bright like a bride, right? May you live like a Goddess. Move... drink boost.- No. Move... move... I haven't yet seen my niece. How are you dad? - You wait. Kusumamba! I got this from town especially for you. Take it. By next year you must gift us a baby, Kusumamba. Kusumamba? - My grandma's name. That's her real name. She changed it to Keerthi for city folks. Come, let's go in Haven't you seen a man till now? What a family! Oh God! You scoundrel, who are you? Bloody donkey How dare! - Why are you beating me? What is your caste, religion?

Please for my sake say okay. My friend will sing now instead of me. About Keerthi! Look how beautiful she is! Sing about her. Sing. Jas the star of sky descended on earth like you? Like a rare gem... like Goddess in a temple... Presiding over heart... Earth hasn't seen anyone till now like her... Won't the man who marries this wealth of beauty be Lord Sri Hari... Can anyone else think and achieve the Goddess's shadow too? A garden grown with so many people's affection... Won't it become a celestial garden of flowers? Making the beauty more beautiful... Is she a gift from the heaven? What man? Children, Look! She's scared. This young woman with her beauty... She pulled everyone towards her... This river with so many bends & curves...

He's marrying Keerthi. It's him. Isn't he smart? Say hi to him. Why are you surprised? She's Keerthi. Vasu's bride You might be tired. Take rest. Guest house is in the next street. Mangaiah, take them. Come madam. Why are you going with them? I'll spend sometime happily with them. You'll be busy here. Tell him. I'll come at night. Let's play cards. - Okay. Your clothes are in the room I'll pick it up later. You don't worry. Come buddy. Forgive me... Turn away the rain... Will you remain like a statue? Silence is broken... Where are you? Would you remain unmarried? Keerthi, sleep early Marriage rituals start by 4 AM. By this time tomorrow you'll be married. If they say love is sin... Can't you deny it? What? Why did you come here now? I was just... My family is everything to me. But I came here without thinking about anything. I don't know why. I feel like I'm dying if I don't see you for few minutes. Is it love? I didn't know till now. Why didn't I get this feeling when you followed me? Or did I hide the feelings in fear? I am confused. Tomorrow I'm getting married. Why am I here now? Have I gone mad? Tell me please. Please... Nothing's wrong in it. It happens in everyone's life. For you it came very late. You were brought up in an orthodox family. What should I do now? Will you come & seek my hand from my family? You are a bride now. People will misunderstand if you're seen here. Come, I'll drop you at home. Why? Are you still thinking about your father's death? No... nothing like that. Then? I didn't care when you came after me. Now you're taking revenge keeping it in mind, right? You want men to beg like you did, right? Tell me. Do you know how much I wished that you'll turn to see me? Why are you hesitating now? Can't you talk to my people? What am I to tell them? You want me to see a family getting destroyed. The moment your grandpa said I was a member of the family. I decided that moment itself, this family is mine. Think over it again. I was an orphan... Now I've grand parents, uncles, aunt, brothers, a full family. Children are very fond of me. If I ask your hand in marriage, can they survive the shock? They'll spit on me for cheating them. Above all my friend Vasu... He brought me here to keep me happy. Do you want me to spoil his happiness? I don't mind losing you. But I can't lose a family & friend. Is this your decision? What can I say now! It's my bad luck to miss a man like you. You'll also marry someone, won't you? No, this is enough. Marriage will settle all issues. You'll be happy. Keep smiling. It's good for health. Grandpa. Don't come near me. Your breath also shouldn't reach me. All I want to know is one thing only. Were you spoiled mentally or else... Do you know how people see women of this family? Like Goddesses! You were seen compromising with a man at midnight... Don't you've any shame? How were you born in this family? Come. Where is Vasu? Go... go away. You're a good man. This family is eternal indebted to you. But we can't give our daughter in marriage to you. Please go away from here. These are old man's words. How dare to enter this house again? Get out. - Uncle! Get out. Disloyal dog. Keerthi isn't such a girl. What did you do to her? What game did you play to change her? So cheaply. Get out. Never again show your face to me. I was just feeling happy about getting a family. But it vanished so quickly. The moment you beat me... I just came to say bye to Vasu. You blamed me a lot. After this you'll not believe anything I say. But I can say confidently one thing. The strong belief you've that your mother is chaste woman, Keerthi is also as chaste as she is. If liking a man is sin, then, every girl is a sinner in this world. Even if I insist on eloping, she'll not come. She loves your family so much. Feel proud of it. Why all this? Grandma, take care of health. Sky will not retain a drop of rain for itself... It happily gives it to earth... Will sea's thirst subside after drinking up all the rivers? Don't lock friendship in a cage? Sending a palanquin, bless happily... Won't your memories turn into tears? Your journey is lovely... Love, pacify my troubled heart... Place the jaggery & cumin seeds on the bride's head How can he survive? Sir, your guest Ganesh The man you leased lands has stabbed him. He's fighting death. We have to take him to town. Would any one come with us? Sir. - Don't you've sense? Don't you know what is to be told and what isn't to be told in a marriage? They'll come after marriage, you go now. You carry on. At least give your car. Sir. See to it. - Okay. Vasu, you carry on. Auspicious time is eloping. I said you can go after marriage, come & sit there. Vasu, I need money. You come with it. I'll get clothes. What man? I'll come with you. What can we do if they don't believe us? Come... come... Stop. I'll also come. Don't go son-in-law. Why are the children going away? Stop... stop. Please forgive us, father-in-law. We are also angry on him. But he doesn't have anyone. You're a God. Don't get angry. Lakshmi, what's this? - I can't stay here. We can't be pitiless like you. Stop I say. Why are you still here. He's near to you than all others. You needn't sit. You can also go. If I wanted to go, I would've gone long back. You didn't raise me like that. Do you think I'm sitting here half-heartedly? I'm happy. I liked him very much and asked him to talk with you. I forgot him the moment, you didn't like him. I'll stay here only. Let them all come back. I'll not go there. Tell someone to get water, I'm feeling giddy. I'll not get up from here, till Vasu comes & marries me. If you want to go, feel free to go. I want Horlicks from tomorrow. Ask the newspaper man to deliver weekly magazines. What's that look? We have given you our daughter. Bloody filthy! Grandma. Oh God! My fate. Will any human like here? Briefs, loincloth and every dirty things is in bathroom. Bloody family! No Holy Basil plant here. No prayer's room. They are killing me. Why don't you coming to do exercise? I've been doing it since morning. Okay, get me a glass of cold water. - You too. We've given our girl to you. Go. Tell him to get provisions. Run out of provision in 2 days. Get them. Have you added my list too? - Yes. You didn't forget anything did you? No, I wrote everything. - List seems little long... You gave your daughter to me, isn't it? Go... I'll get it by working overtime. That's it. You came as guest and stole our girl. Bloody thief. Thief! It's me. - So what? Early morning! Last night up to 3 am... Look at your face. Go to office I'm your husband. Why are you shouting at me? Husband? Feeling pity on you they got me married to you. You can't buy a car but... Sorry, we are not used to toilets. So we went out. Very difficult I'm going to office. House is very small. Please adjust. In a month, I'll fix a bigger house. Won't you talk to me?
