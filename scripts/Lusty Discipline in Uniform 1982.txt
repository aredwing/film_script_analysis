Sailor Uniform Erotic Training aka Lusty Discipline in Uniform Screenplay by Kazuo 'Gaira' Komizu Music: The Mighty Duck Editing: Osamu Tanaka Lighting: Kentaro Kondo Cinematography: Shiro Suzuki Assistant Director: Yoji Matsumoto Starring: Introducing: Kazumi Kawai as Mikiko Tamami Kyo Kayoko Sugi Shiro Shimomoto as Masahiko Yoshimatsu Directed by Mamoru Watanabe Only me. You'll blossom for me alone. This is the girl. Untainted by anything. Innocent and pristine. The girl I've been searching for. Welcome home, you're early. Where are you going? I'm just going to the supermarket. Take care. Tami Okada and Mikiko. No man in their house, hmm? Hello? Mikiko-CHAN? Yes, I'm Mikoko, but who are you? Mikiko-CHAN... Were you asleep? Are you wearing your pajamas? Who is this? Who are you? What colour are your panties? White? Pink? Do you masturbate? Mama! Mikiko-CHAN... How do you masturbate? Hey, Mikiko-CHAN... Who are you? Don't pull such pranks late at night. Mama, I'm scared. It's nothing. Just a random nuisance call. But he knew my name was Mikiko. Okay, if he calls again, we'll report it to the police. Don't worry. Now, go to bed. Goodnight. Teacher... This paper will get me the credits, right? You... This paper is full of nothing but quotations! It's plagiarism! Plagiarism! Who would give you any credits?! But I just happened to think of the same things. Nothing else came to mind. You basically plagiarised all this from that male teacher, didn't you? To make things worse, he's got no originality at all. Trying to get credits with something like this... Come on, Teacher... Help me out... You're immoral. Who was the one who made me become immoral? Not today. No, no, let's do it. I don't feel like it today. No, professor. If you won't do it with me... Holy girl? Mikiko? Mikiko... Mikiko, Mikiko, Mi-ki-ko... Teacher, is that your new lover? No. Liar! I see. You're bored of me already... ...so you're chasing after that girl, huh? It's not like that. She's not that kind of girl. Oh my... You seem quite infatuated with her. Have I become redundant? I'm... ...going to complain to the faculty. Dumping me after you've toyed with every inch of my body... You... Miss Mukai! So, Teacher... ...make sure to get me those credits... ...okay? But with my position as a mere lecturer... I'm sure you'll be able to figure something out. Right? Teacher... Hurry up... That hurts! Teacher, go more slowly! That feels good, Teacher... Heh... Don't worry, Teacher... I'm not so obsessed with you. Let's just give and take, okay? Teacher... Teacher... I'm sorry, are you all right? Umm... I'm all right. I was partially at fault too. Please don't worry about me. I'm really sorry. This happened because I was careless... Ahh, all your shopping is smashed up. Umm... If it's not too forward of me... Please allow me to accompany you to the supermarket and buy your shopping again. All right... Eggs and... Lady, this 283-yen item... That's rose ham. Ah, this, right? And boneless ham. It was advertised on TV. That's all. I see. Ah, lady... Ah... Umm... These are for? I'm just trying to make up for the inconvenience I've caused to you. Please allow me to do this little bit. I'm really sorry to trouble you. Let's go then, shall we? Welcome home, Mama. I'm home! I almost let myself get run over by this man's car. No, no, it was my carelessness. Is she your daughter? Yes, she's Mikiko, my daughter. Well... I must say that I avoided inflicting tragedy... ...on such a beautiful mother-and-daughter pair by the narrowest of margins. From now on, I'll be more careful when driving. Well, I'll be leaving now. Umm... How about coming in for a cup of tea? Ah, I'm afraid I can't. I actually have some business to settle. I've an appointment with my senior colleague from the university office, Professor Miya. Maybe next time, if we have a chance to meet again. Well then, Mikiko-CHAN. Sorry for all the trouble. Goodbye. Thank you. I did it. I did it. That was Mr. Yoshimatsu. He said that he's a university lecturer. Isn't he a kind man? He helped me with my shopping. Wow, kiwi fruits. And... oranges. Mr. Yoshimatsu said those are to make up for what he did. Mama, Mr. Yoshimatsu seems like a nice guy, doesn't he? - Such a gentleman... - Yes. Mama... What is it? It's nothing... Don't tease me, Miki-CHAN... Don't tease me... Soon... ...you'll be mine. Mikiko... I want to hold you in my arms... Strip off your panties... Lick your buttocks... I want to lick your love juice... Mikiko... I want... I want to suck your breasts... Mikiko... Hello, this is the Okada residence. Ahh... Mikiko-CHAN? That's you, isn't it, Mikiko-CHAN? Have you kissed anyone before? Shall I kiss you? - With my tongue... - Mama! I'll lick around inside your mouth. How about that, Mikiko? The first time hurts, but I'll lick you lots... - ...and then I'll put my penis... - Stop this at once! Why the nuisance calls? Do you have some grudge against us? Oh. The old hag? Hey, lady... How many years has it been since you lost your husband? Has that part of you remained empty all this time? You probably occasionally play with cucumbers or sausages, don't you? Just who are you? I'm going to call the police! Yes, try calling them. I'll give you a hint. I'm close by. Really close by. Really. Where are you?! Come out! You coward! Harassing us because there are only women in our house?! What is it, Mama? It's nothing! Miki-CHAN, everything's fine now. Now go back to your room. Okay. Goodnight, Mama. Goodnight. Everything's fine already, so don't worry! Do you imagine a man penetrating your hot, wet slit... ...when you're sticking cucumbers and sausages inside yourself? How wretched. You're as good as mine already. This angel, to whom you girls are nothing by comparison... Soon she'll belong to me alone. Just watch. Mikiko-CHAN. Mr. Yoshimatsu, right? Good morning. Good morning. What a coincidence... ...us running into each other in such a crowded place. What's wrong? You look rather gloomy. Ah, I know. You must have forgotten to do your homework, right? That's not it. So what is it? If it's anything I can help with, won't you tell me about it? We only met yesterday... ...but somehow, you and your mother don't feel like strangers to me. Wait, no, I didn't mean anything weird by that, okay? It just feels like I've known you two for a long, long time. Well? Umm... My family is facing a serious problem. Oh no, I'm going to be late! Mr. Yoshimatsu, please meet with my mother and ask her about it. Our phone number is 451-4500. My mother is really troubled by this problem, so please... Won't you call my mother and help her out? I'm going to be late, so I'll be going now. All right. 451-4500, right? Yes. I'm counting on you. Hello, this is the Okada residence. Oh my, Mr. Yoshimatsu? Why are you calling? Huh? Mikiko? Yes. I happened to run into her at the train station. Yes. She seemed troubled by something... ...and she requested that I call you and see if I could help you out. If it's anything that I can help with... Yes. Yes. The Keiwa Department Store? Yes, I know that place. At 1 p.m.? Yes, I'll be there. I don't know who he is or where he's from... So what should I do? You're too beautiful. Huh? You and your lovely daughter are too beautiful. Oh... Not at all. This could be called a case of the misfortune of the virtuous... Oh my... Sorry, it's not something to laugh about, is it? Well, should anything happen, please call me at any time. All right. Well, at this time, I guess you could call it lucky... ...but I'm living a solitary life as a bachelor right now. For some reason, I haven't had much luck with women... Wait, uh... That doesn't mean I like men. So you're single, Mr. Yoshimatsu? Yes. I've always been holed up in my office, working on papers... ...and before I knew it, I was a middle-aged bachelor. But thanks to that I think... ...Ill be able to get a chair as an assistant professor next year. Mikiko said it's okay. That's great. Ah, pardon me. She said that even if I liked you... I shouldn't be too much of a delinquent and should go home early. Ah, did you tell her to lock up the house properly? Well then, let's go. We are assailed by unwanted waves of information. The television waves are like narcotics that force themselves on us. Commercials attack through the gaps in people's lives... ...and are nothing more than a dressed-up method of forced selling. Bond companies attack us by telephone. Advertisers bombard us with mail advertisements. This has made humans lose their aesthetic sensibilities... ...and proudly live degenerate lives. Last night and the night before... ...all the time I was engrossed in my research... The two of you, mother and daughter... ...were crying from being subjected to senseless violence. That's enough, Mr. Yoshimatsu. Please don't blame yourself like that. If only I had met you earlier... Please excuse me for a moment. Are you all right? I think I might be drunk... I'm so glad that I met you. You gave me so much courage today. Mrs. Tami... Mrs. Tami, forgive me. Ever since I met you, I was hoping that things would turn out like this... Mrs. Tami... I'm so happy. We were fated to be together. Mrs. Tami... Wait. Eh? I'll go take a shower. All right. I'd forgotten. How many years has it been? Mrs. Tami... I love you. Don't look. It's embarrassing! It's beautiful. I'm embarrassed! You're beautiful. Yoshimatsu... Mrs. Tami... Mrs. Tami, move your hips more. That tickles! Stop... That's enough. Come on... No... That's enough. That was great. I love you... ...darling. I love you too. Come on, Miki-CHAN will worry if you come home too late. Go take a shower. I can't move... Hello, this is the Okada residence. Hello? Let me lick your ass hole! You're alone, aren't you? I know. I'm coming over to stick my tongue into you there. Wait for me. I'm coming tonight. Are you listening? I'm coming tonight. Oh, perhaps Miki-CHAN is already asleep. Miki-CHAN?! What is it, Miki-CHAN? It's all your fault, Mama! You came home so late, leaving me all alone! He called again! He said he's coming here tonight! I'm scared! He said he's coming to do indecent things to me! I'm was scared... so scared. I'm sorry, Miki-CHAN. But everything's going to be all right from tonight onwards... We're going to be all right... Listen, Miki-CHAN... Mama and Mr. Yoshimatsu are going to get married. Eh? Get married? Good evening, Miki-CHAN. May I sit here? It must be a surprise, coming so suddenly... ...but after discussing it with your mother... ...we think this would be the best thing for all of us. I'm sorry that we made the decision without asking you, Miki-CHAN, but... ...I hope you'll forgive us? You probably aren't prepared to suddenly have me as your father, right? But... ...if you'd only agree to let us get married... ...Ill be able to protect both of you from tonight onwards. That way, it'll be all right no matter who comes to harass you. I'll put my life on the line to make both of you happy. Congratulations. Thank you. I'll definitely make you happy. Now, it's already late. You can sleep peacefully from tonight onwards. So long... I've been waiting for so long. It's so cute... I've been waiting for so long without doing anything immoral. I want to eat it. Miki-CHAN is close by... - ...so let's stop for tonight. - No! Did that hurt, darling? Darling... ...let's do it? I guess I've got no choice. Quietly, all right? Be quiet... Quiet... That was great. Now... Sleep tight. So, after we've submitted the marriage registration at the registrar tomorrow... Why don't the two - no, the three of us, go on a trip together? You want to take me, such a grown-up daughter, on your honeymoon? That's right. It'll be fun. How many cubes of sugar? One. Then I'll definitely do my best for the university entrance exams. As for the summer holiday next year... Well... Yes, we'll go overseas. All right! Thanks. I should be on my way now. Sorry, Miki-CHAN, but I'll be leaving first. Oh, but to make up for that... When the time comes, I'll be your spy for my university's entrance exams. Now, now, you shouldn't do that... Yay! As expected of a university lecturer. Abusing my authority? You really shouldn't do anything like that. Miki-CHAN will neglect her studies. No, I'll just give her some hints. Right, Miki-CHAN? I'll be going then. If anything happens, please call me at my office. Take care! Oh, let's eat out tonight, the three of us. Okay. - Goodbye. - Take care! Take care! Mama, isn't it really great that such a wonderful person showed up? Yes, it is. It just goes to show that everyone has a chance to find happiness. Yes... We'll have lots of fun as a family. Now, it's about time for you to be leaving too, Miki-CHAN. Go, go! - You're going to be late! - You're right, I've got to get going. I'm putting my life on the line! I did it. I really did it! It was perfect. Nobody will find out. Why? What should I do? What should I do from now on? Mama... Mikiko, don't cry anymore. Your mother won't come back. She looked so happy... So happy... Why did she have to die like that? I feel so sorry for her! It was an accident. Why? We were going to start a new life... So at least you, Mikiko... ...should enjoy the happy life that your mother didn't get to. All right? I'll definitely make you happy... Sad... I'm so sad... Mikiko... Mikiko... My Mikiko... I love you! Love? Didn't you love Mama? It's not like that. My love for you... ...includes the love I had for your mother. My love for you, Mikiko... ...is of a different dimension. Yes... It's a collection of many different kinds of love... Mikiko... Mikiko... For example, even if I were to have to kill countless people for it... ...I would not be able to resist your beauty. And so... ...the death of your beloved mother will not deter me either. You're my life. I don't care if I go to hell. Papa... ...always loves me. I'll teach you all sorts of things from now onwards. You'll become the perfect Venus... ...to the point that everything pales in comparison to you. THE END
