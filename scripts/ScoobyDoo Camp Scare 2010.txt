Now, 50 years ago, right here at Little Moose... ...there was a counselor named Jerry McCreedy... ...the meanest counselor in the history of summer camp. If you were late to flag raising, he'd yell at you. If you were afraid of the water, he'd throw you in the lake. If you had candy, he'd eat it. So one day, the campers decided to play a little prank on old McCreedy. They put a snake in his daypack. And while Jerry was out hiking, he reached for his trail mix... ...and got a handful of slithering serpent. McCreedy was so scared... ...he lost his footing and clean fell off Devil's Drop. Slid all the way down on his face... ...banging his head on every rock. What happened to him? They never found the body. But legend has it... ...the significant head trauma drove him insane. They call him the Woodsman. It's the Woodsman! That was great, Darryl. You had them jumping higher than a tick on a trampoline. All right, everybody, that's enough for tonight. Back to your cabins. It was a cool story. I'm tired. What? I wasn't scared either. What was that? I could swear I locked that door. It's the Woodsman! He's real! Aah! The boathouse. It can't be. Here you go, Scoob, 18 inches of hoagie heaven. Ooh. Yum. Now this is what I call camping. - Good friends. - Good food. And most importantly... - No monsters. - No monsters. - Monster. - Monster. Oh! Oh! Oof! Sorry, I was just checking out this mosquito-proof suit. Maybe I should try a small. You guys, quit messing around. We're here to pick up supplies. You know how excited Fred is about taking us to his camp. I am so excited to take you guys to my old summer camp. Like, you don't say. You guys are gonna love being counselors at Camp Little Moose. Did I ever tell you the time me and Davey Reynolds... ...tried canoeing Schmidt's Creek without a paddle? Yes. There we were, 10 years old and not a paddle between us. Sure do appreciate your business, kids. Say, if you're heading up to Little Moose Lake... ...you best get a move on. Those mountain roads can be mighty tricky come nightfall. Where are Shaggy and Scooby? Look out. Scooby, are you okay? Don't worry about him. He landed on a cushion of freeze-dried ice cream. Mm. Rocky Road. Camp City Historical Museum. - What's that? - Oh, just a little hobby of mine. There's a lot of history in this area. Myths, legends. Even a few ghost stories. You wanna hear one? - Nope. - I'm good. According to my GPS... ...we should be able to see the camp right now. Hey, gang, check it out. Wow, that place is beautiful. To be honest, Fred, I wasn't too excited about roughing it. But I think I'm going to like Camp Little Moose. Oh, that's not Camp Little Moose. - It's not? - That's Camp Big Moose. That's Camp Little Moose. Oh, they've really fixed the place up. You've gotta be kidding me. I've spent a zillion summers here as a camper... ...but now, I'm finally gonna be a counselor. It's my chance to pass on all our camp traditions... ...to a new generation of Little Moose. This place is a dump. It's rustic. Man, I don't care what it looks like as long as it isn't haunted. Stop. Turn back. This place is haunted. Hey, what seems to be the problem? He's real. Get out of here while you still can. I'm going to Camp Big Moose. - What was that all about? - Beats me. But we're gonna find out. What part of "Get out, save yourselves" didn't you understand? How about this one time we listen to the wild-eyed lunatic? Come on, you guys. This is not a Camp Little Moose welcome. Where is everybody? Just a campfire story, but he was here. Do you hear that? Madder than a bear with a bee sting. - It's coming from down there. He was laughing when he threw his ax at me. I think it'd be a good idea to cancel the second session of camp. Way ahead of you, Ranger Knudsen. I've already notified all the parents. Camp Little Moose is officially closed for the summer. What? You can't cancel camp. Why, I'd know that ascot anywhere. Freddy Jones. Get over here and give me a Little Moose welcome. - High in the mountains - Deep in the spruce - On the shore of the lake - It's Camp Little Moose Little Moose, Little Moose, Little Moose Oh, man. Ah. The Little Moose welcome always warms my heart. - What's this about canceling camp? - And what happened to the boathouse? I don't mean to scare you kids... ...but we're having a little trouble with an ax-wielding maniac. It was the Woodsman. Oh, no, not the Woodsman. Who's the Woodsman? Like, I don't know, and I don't wanna find out. The Woodsman? Oh, come on, Burt, you don't believe that old campfire story. Nah. I swear, Fred. I saw him with my own eyes. Ha. It's probably just a prank by those snobs at Camp Big Moose. I've heard of camp rivalries, but this is a little extreme. You hit the nail on the head, beautiful. Oh, I didn't say anything. Well, I wasn't talking to you. Me? It's best if you folks just head on home. Let the professionals handle this. - Somebody likes you. - Shut up. But I was gonna be a counselor, a mentor, a hero. I'm sorry, Fred, but I had no choice. No campers means no camp. Where is everybody? Camp's canceled. Didn't you kids get the message? What message? One that said Welcome to Camp Little Moose. I'm Fred. I'll be your counselor, mentor, hero. Good to meet you, Fred. I'm Luke. Trudy. Deacon. I don't know if this is such a good idea, Fred. Maybe we should just put these kids back on that bus. Hey. Hey. Hey, where are you going? You get back here! So, what will it be first? Horseback riding? No, no, no, I got it. Zip line. Sounds awesome. Sounds awful. I feel like Fred's forgetting something. Like the fact that we have a mystery on our hands? That's it. Like the only mystery I'm interested in solving... ...is The Case of What's For Dinner. What do you say we look for clues in the kitchen, Scoob? Way ahead of you. It's okay, Deacon. You're still on the ground. See? Ground. Solid ground. Keep going, Trudy. You're going to love the zip line. What's a zip line? I'm just trying to get cell phone reception. Okay, Luke, whenever you're ready, just step off the... Whoo-hoo-hoo! - Platform. Yeah! Ha-ha-ha. Oh! Hee-hee-ha! Awesome! Whoo! Hmm. Something is missing from my Five-Alarm Chili. Oh, man, Scoob, those are the hottest peppers on the planet. - You okay, Scooby-Doo? - Delicious. I don't mean to brag, but I was Little Moose Fire Starting Champion six years running. And with a little practice, you too can learn to master this skill. Check it out. All right, Luke. - Good work. - Who's got the marshmallows? Hmm. Oh. Like, if we don't get more firewood, my chili's gonna be too chilly to eat. Don't cry, buddy. There's plenty of wood in the woods. Oh, onions. Good thinking, Scoob. Yep, no doubt about it. These are moose tracks. Those look a little small for a moose. Are you sure? I'm a camp counselor. Of course I'm sure. Those are moose tracks. Shh. I think the moose is on the other side of these bushes. - What? - That moose looks awfully familiar. Okay, guys, back to camp. It's arts and crafts time. Fred? Velma? Daphne? Woodsman. Shaggy! Oh, Scoob. When you went for wood... ...I didn't know you were gonna bring it back one piece at a time. Wood man. Wood man. Yeah, wood, man. That's what we need. I guess I'll have to get it myself. Woodsman. I saw smoke coming from the chimney. Figured you boys could use some more firewood. Like, thanks, Burt. Dinner's almost ready. Like, man, I hope you're hungry... ...because I'm about to serve up Shaggy's famous... ...Five-Alarm Hole-In-The-Bowl Chili. Ho-ho. Gah! Spicy. Aha. Mm. Mm? Good morning, Camp Little Moose. This is your favorite camp counselor and mentor inviting you to rise and shine. It's a balmy 67 degrees with winds... ... coming out of the north northwest at eight miles per hour. We're expecting a high today in upper 80s... ... so don't forget your sunscreen. - SPF 45, recommended... - Is this guy for real? ...because today is Water Fun Day. - I'm afraid so. So let's meet down by the dock ASAP, okay, Little Moosers? Hey, campers. Who's ready to have fun? Like, an extra hour of sleep sounds fun to us. I'm up. I'm up. Okay, gang, here's the plan. An hour of canoeing, two hours of fishing, followed by a half hour of swimming. In there? Yep. Hey, why don't we go up to Big Moose Lake? - That lake is sweet. - Oh, no. Not Big Moose Lake. - We can't go up there. - Why not? Because Big Moose Lake is haunted. - I'm out. - Wait a minute. How can a lake be haunted? Many years ago, there was a camper named Neil Fisher. The other kids picked on him all the time... ...so he spent most of his days swimming in Big Moose Lake. In fact, he spent so much time in the water... ...he grew gills and fins. He became the Fishman. And he haunts Big Moose Lake to this day. - Is that true? - Of course not. He just doesn't want us to go to Big Moose Lake. Guys, we've got a perfectly good lake right here. We're going to Big Moose. We're going to Big Moose. Hey, you're all wet. - Ugh. Boys are so immature. They're just having fun. Hey, the sun's going down. If we're gonna go swimming, we better do it now. I get the feeling you're not too crazy about being at camp. This is not my idea of a good time... ...my parents thought a little fresh air would do me some good. They say I spend too much time inside in front of the computer. I'm not exactly the outdoorsy-type myself, but just give it a chance. Who knows? Maybe you'll have fun. Luke, the secret to catching fish is all about... I got one. Whoa! Oh! - Oh. - Hey, slow it down. - Whoa! Whoa! - Sweet. - Not sweet. I can't stand those snobs from Camp Big Moose... ...with their fancy speedboats and air-conditioned cabins and... And hot counselors. Sorry about that. Oh, our fault. Totally our fault. No problem at all. Ha-ha. Oh, boy, Scoob, it looks like you're ready to go scuba diving. Scuba-duba-doo. A building? Fishman. Fishman? Fishman! Hey, where's Deacon? Fishman! - Did they say...? - Fishman. Ah! Come on, guys. Hey. Guys, we're going the wrong way. Daphne, like, reverse engines. Oh, no! Hey, guys, how was the canoeing? Then I saw them coming down that hill... ...faster than a pack of buzzards on a bobsled. Like, we almost became Fishman food. Can you describe this Fishman? Fins. Huge teeth and about yay high. That's Neil Fisher to a T. First the Woodsman, now the Fishman. All of Little Moose's campfire legends are coming to life. There really is no other explanation. How about someone is using these monsters to try and scare us away? Why don't you just stick to being pretty. - Did he just say what I think he said? - Yeah. He thinks you're pretty. Shaggy... Like, Scoob says he saw a building under the water. Underwater building. I'll put it in my report. If there really are monsters loose, you kids better head back to town. This camp is just too dangerous. Like, you heard the man. We're out of here, Scoob. Let's bounce. We're not going anywhere. We're not? If someone's trying to scare us away, we need to find out why. The next time they come into our camp, we're gonna be ready. We got him. Now it's time to get some answers. Ladies and gentlemen, say hello to the Woodsman. You're not the Woodsman. You're that gorgeous counselor from Big Moose. I'm Jessica. Ugh. If you don't mind me asking, young lady... ...why are you sneaking around our camp after lights out? I didn't mean to scare you guys... ...but some of our camping equipment has gone missing... ...and, well, I thought it might be you Little Moosers playing a prank. Little Moosers don't pull pranks. We leave that to those snobs at Camp Big Moose. No offense. Stolen camping gear? Monster attacks? What is going on? Get out! You don't have to tell us twice. I think we lost him. Like, I spoke too soon. - Maybe he'll give up. - Oh! Scoob, now is not the time to stop. No more roof. - You okay? - No. Me neither. - Scooby. - Shaggy. Like, dude, where did he go? So, what's the plan, Fred? We hide here until he goes away. That's your plan? That is so Little Moose. I suppose you have a better one? Yeah. Run! I told you to get out. Hold that thought, Woodsie. Hold on, little lady. Like, am I glad to see you. Scooby, cut it out. Is everybody okay? Like, ask me again when we're out of Camp Creepy. Where's Jessica? Come on. We have to save her. Hold it right there, Woodsman. We got you. There's nowhere to go. Zoinks. Oh. You took the word right out of my mouth. Ho-ho. Here, let me help you up. - Oh, no. The Woodsman is up there. - Mm-mm. No, he's not. He's gone. Oh, will you look at this place? Now, that just ain't right. Hey, what's going on out here? Yeah, we're trying to sleep. Seriously? Like, you kids slept through all that? Heh. I'm impressed. Like, this place has everything. It doesn't have everything. Personal transporters. Computer lab. Cute boys. We don't have cute boys at Little Moose. Uh... Hello. Why couldn't I go to this camp? About a week ago... ...we noticed that some sonar equipment had gone missing... ...from the Marine Biology Center. A few days later... ...an RV disappeared from the Motorsports Pavilion. Now they're just showing off. Most luxury RVs have GPS locators built in. I'll ping the area to see if it's sending out a signal. In the middle of Shadow Canyon. Shadow Canyon? They say that place is haunted by the ghost of a lost hiker... ...still searching for her way out. They call her the Specter of Shadow Canyon. Legend has it if you hear her terrifying wail, you're a goner. Dude, I did not need to hear that. Ho-ho-ho. The stolen RV is in Shadow Canyon. The missing sonar equipment, that could only be used in the lake. If we're gonna get to the bottom of this... ...I guess we better split up and look for clues. Let me get this straight. There's a crazy man with an ax in the woods... ...a ghost in the canyon... ...a fish monster in the water... ...and you guys wanna split up and look for clues? Yep. I'll take the lake. I wanna check out that building Scooby saw. - Who's with me? I'll go. I'm a certified scuba instructor. "I'm a certified scuba instructor." - What was that, Daph? - Huh? Nothing. I'll go with you. Scuba diving? Sweet. Count me in. The rest of us will head to Shadow Canyon. - Oh, no. - Like, you can forget it. Every time someone tells a campfire story, it comes true. Scooby-Doo and me are trying to live a Specter-free lifestyle here. You can find us in that five-star dining hall when you get back. Maybe you should take Deacon with you. He seems a little freaked out. funnykiddy rip for Subscene.com Luke, if the Fishman surprises us, I'll catch him with this net launcher. So there's no reason to be... ...afraid. How am I supposed to be his mentor if he never listens? Don't worry, Freddy. You'll get your chance. We lost the signal. Now what? - It must be the batteries. No. I just bought new batteries for the trip. Shadow Canyon's not too far from here. It can't be too hard to find one stolen RV. I wouldn't try and explore that place without a map or a GPS, young lady. Many a hiker has lost their way around those parts. I hope Fred and Daphne are having more luck than we are. Check it out. Tire tracks. Good eye, Trudy. Oh! That was close. - Are you okay? - Yeah. - Thanks to Daphne. - Anytime, Freddy. Hmp. Scooby was right. There's a whole town under there. We gotta check that out. We can't go back out there with the Fishman waiting for us. Then I guess we'll have to see where this cave leads. Oh, that's right. Probably. - Yeah. My parents showed me... Now this is my idea of roughing it. You said it. Aren't you guys the least bit worried about the Woodsman coming back? Man, all I'm worried about is whether to have chocolate on my cheesecake... ...or cheese on my chocolate cake. Why not both? Scooby-Doo, you are a genius. Yeah. A genius. I really think we ought to stay here at Camp Big Moose. If we go back to Little Moose, something bad's gonna happen. Put that down. What do you guys think you're doing here? You don't go to Camp Big Moose. Busted. Scoob, let's get out of here. Whew. Ooh. Yaah! Where are the brakes on this thing? Aah! Hmm. Man, that was close. Whatever you do, dude... ...do not move. - Got it. Look out! Shadow Canyon. This place creeps me out. Come on, that RV's gotta be around here somewhere. That's weird. The tracks just come to a stop. An entire RV doesn't just disappear. Ah-ha. Oh, man, I feel like I got hit by a truck. Try an RV. You guys found it. Ingenious. Someone painted the RV to look exactly like the canyon wall. Come on. Let's check it out. Like, I would go with you, but I don't know which one to follow. Looks like someone's been staked out in here for days. Yeah, smells like it too. This must be the sonar equipment that went missing from Camp Big Moose. What are they using it for? It's password protected. Well, that tears it. Nothing we can do now. - Guess we better get out of here. - Let me take a shot at it. I'll use admin privileges to bypass the authentication requirement. Then you can modify the registry to a temp password. Good thinking. This appears to be a sonar image of the bottom of the lake. What on Earth are they looking for? It feels like we've been walking forever. There's gotta be a way out of here. Hey, guys. I think I found something. There's a whole crate of candles here. That doesn't look like a candle. Luke. Aah! - That was dynamite, wasn't it? - Yes. Yes, it was. And there's a lot of it. What would someone need all that dynamite for? Daylight. That explosion just gave us a way out. Like, did you hear that? Uh... - Nope. - Hoo-hoo. Good, me neither. Did you guys hear that noise? Oh, you mean, like, that noise? It's the Specter of Shadow Canyon. Quick, in the jeep. Like, step on it. Burt, if you have any more campfire stories... ...I'd appreciate it if you'd keep them to yourself. Scoob was right. It looked like an entire town on the bottom of the lake. I've heard of lakeside property, but that is ridiculous. It explains why someone was searching the lake with sonar equipment. But what about the dynamite? How does that fit into all this? Oh, are you guys really gonna just sit around here... ...and try and solve this mystery? Clearly, someone doesn't want us to be at Camp Little Moose. We should listen to them. I'm going to Camp Big Moose, where it's safe. Who's with me? Trudy, Luke, maybe it's best if y'all go with Deacon. Forget it. I'm a Little Mooser. I wanna help you guys catch whoever's messing with our camp. Me too. - Are you sure? - Yep. I wanna help solve the mystery. Oh. You're all nuts, you hear me? Nuts. I'm out of here. I better give him a lift up to Big Moose. I have to get the jeep back anyway. It still feels like we're missing a piece of the puzzle. What we need is an expert on this area. I know just the person. Yeah, you kids definitely came to the right place. I know just about everything there is to know about this area. What can you tell us about a town on the bottom of Big Moose Lake? Ah. You mean Moose Creek. It used to be an old mining town. But years ago, they moved everybody out of there... ...dammed the creek and created Big Moose Lake. Of course, that's only part of the story. Oh, boy. Moose Creek was home to a notorious gangster named Ricky LaRue. After pulling the biggest bank heist of his life, the cops were hot on Ricky's trail. So the legend goes... ...he stashed his loot somewhere in Moose Creek. They locked LaRue up and threw away the key. And not long after, the dam was built... ...flooding the town of Moose Creek. LaRue's treasure was lost forever... ...somewhere down in the depths of Big Moose Lake. - Do you mind if we borrow this? - Be my guest. But if you kids happen to find LaRue's loot... ...don't be afraid to spend a little of that scratch over at Camp City, you hear? Guys, listen to this. Before LaRue died, he told his cellmate, BabyFace Boretti... ...the secret to finding his hidden gold: "When dawn breaks on the summer solstice... ...the steeple will point the way." The summer solstice? That's today. Or it will be when the sun rises in a few hours. Get this. Two months ago, BabyFace Boretti escaped from jail. Like, one thing's for sure, man. This guy's too short to be the Woodsman or Fishman. He must have an accomplice. Or stilts. But why try to scare us away from Camp Little Moose? - What does that have to do with it? - Jinkies, here's Big Moose Lake. Here's the dam. And below it, Camp Little Moose. If someone wanted to get to the treasure, all they'd have to do is blow the dam. The dynamite. But if they blow the dam, all that water will flood our camp. Not Little Moose. All of my beloved childhood memories will be underwater. Not to mention Burt, Luke and Trudy. We have to get back to camp. Fast. What happened? Looks like the Woodsman had a field day while we were gone. - Burt. Trudy. Luke. - You're back. That old boy chopped up my camp faster than a beaver with a buzz saw. I was so scared. I thought he was gonna find us. I'm sorry, Fred. If I was a real Little Mooser... ...I would have stopped him from destroying our camp. Hey, don't be so hard on yourself, Luke. Little Moose isn't about the cabins and the canoes and campfires. The true spirit of Little Moose is in here. - And you've got it. - I do? High in the mountains Deep in the spruce On the shore of a lake It's Camp Little Moose Little Moose, Little Moose, Little Moose Oh, yeah. Fred Jones: Counselor, mentor, hero. Guys, I just thought of something. If the Woodsman didn't find Burt, Luke and Trudy... ...then he thinks the camp is empty. So? If the camp is empty, then he thinks it's okay to... Everybody, into the van. Fred, if you're back here, then who's driving? Like, Scoob, I didn't know you could drive. I can't. Like, we're running out of dock. Scooby, that was amazing. - Did you plan that? - Nope. Heh. Look. Big Moose Lake is almost completely gone. Like, presto. Instant town, just subtract water. Come on, let's check it out. This is so cool. Well, these shoes are ruined. Gang, look. The steeple. "As dawn breaks on the summer solstice, the steeple will point the way." Somebody's coming. Shh. Uhn! - Gotcha. - Uh... Fred? We have to stop meeting like this. You can let go of her now. Oh, uh, right. Jessica, what are you doing here? After the dam blew, I saw Deacon heading this way... ...so I followed him. Deacon? That kid's afraid of his own shadow. Why would he come down to Moose Creek? Not now, Scoob. Guys, in here. We're locked in. Deacon, what are you doing? The name ain't Deacon, toots. It's BabyFace Boretti. I admit, I did not see that coming. That way. Oh, now what? Well, I'd love to stay and chat, but I got a date with a treasure. Let her go, Woodsman. I told you to get out, but you didn't listen. Now you're gonna pay. Fred, look out. Uhn. Help! - Mm. Thanks. - Anytime. Ahem. Uh... Good work, Luke. Like, how long have we been in here? Five minutes. I can't do hard time. I gotta get out of here. Like, help. I'm too young. I'm going crazy. Someone, free us. Shaggy? - Huh. How'd they get out? Oh-ho-ho. Jailbreak. Cool. We got the Woodsman. He's... Gone. The sun is coming up. Look, the steeple is pointing the way. The treasure must be right here. Allow me. Found it. It's the treasure of Ricky LaRue. Hey, fish face. Like, back away from my buddy. Ooh! It's time to find out who this Fishman really is. The Woodsman? Ranger Knudsen? He was the Woodsman and the Fishman? Yep. And I've got a feeling if we searched his ranger station... ...we'd find a Specter costume too. You think you got me all figured out, don't you, beautiful? Oh, I didn't say anything. I think he was talking to me. Oh, right. Looks like we foiled his plan. Like, not his plan. Their plan. I got him. Get this dog off of me! Uhn! Oh! I can't believe Deacon was really BabyFace Boretti. After BabyFace broke out of prison... ...he teamed up with Ranger Knudsen to find LaRue's treasure. Knudsen wore the Fishman costume as cover... ... to search the lake for the lost town using the stolen sonar equipment. He used the Woodsman costume to scare everyone away from Camp Little Moose. But with the solstice approaching and us showing up... ...they had to step up their game. - Exactly. Boretti posed as a camper named Deacon, acting as an inside man. That's why Deacon kept trying to get us to leave. He wasn't afraid of the Woodsman. He needed us gone so they could blow the dam. But when we found that RV, they realized we were getting close. So Knudsen brought the Specter to life to try and scare us off for good. Like, step on it. Like, I've got one question. How did Knudsen make the Specter fly? Zip line. We would have gotten away with it too if it weren't for you meddling kids. Fred... ...I just wanted to say... - Shh. Uh-uh-uh. Jessica... ...this thing between you and me, it could never work. You're Big Moose, I'm Little Moose. We're just too different. I'm sorry. I was just gonna say thanks again for saving my life. Oh. Oh, that thing. Sure, you're welcome. Smooth. Real smooth. Wait for me? In your dreams, Knudsen. What are we gonna do? I got a lake with no camp and you got a camp with no lake. Huh. Like, Scooby-Doo, that's perfect. All right! He wouldn't stop searching for LaRue's treasure. He'd sneak out every night and scour the depths of the lake. Ranger Knudsen was driven mad by greed. They say he still wanders these woods with an ax... ...completely out of his mind. - He calls himself the Woodsman. The Woodsman. It's the Woodsman. No, it's not. It's only... Scooby-Dooby-Boo.
