Well, I have it with me. Man! Let's go. Wanna go? Yeah? All right. Okay, come on. Whoo. Aah. So they're all still back in Ohio? Yeah. Everyone except for my sister. She lives in Santa Rosa. She's married. What's her name? Um, Val. Does she have kids? Yeah. A little girl, Megan. She was born with a wandering eye. They did all these operations when she was a kid. She wears these really thick glasses. She's very pretty. My dad just died. Prostate cancer. Oh, I am so sorry. It's okay. Were you guys really close? Yeah. He was a great guy. Sweet.

What kind of things? You don't go on, like, a vacation? No. I don't have sex with people for money. Why do you have to talk like that? Richard, there are lots of other women... Who would love to do that with you. What if I paid you, like, $ 10,000? Jesus Christ! You got a lot of money to throw around. Yeah, I made a lot of money last year - over a million dollars. - Everyone's a millionaire these days. - I've worked so hard. I just- I wanna have fun, I wanna celebrate. You know? I'm not a bad guy. What are you talking about exactly? Nonstop sex 24 hours a day? Well, not like nonstop sex, necessarily. I just wanna get to know you better. Oh, you wanna get to know me better. And I'm not talking about marriage. It's just the weekend. All right, let's talk about this. I'm not saying that I- - I would... do it, but- I mean, if I was gonna do it, there'd be a lot of conditions. Okay. Um, no talk about feelings. Mmm. No kissing on the mouth. No penetration. What do you mean, no penetration? I mean, no fucking. Okay, I can live with that. It's all an act. You know that, right? And you'll pay me cash, up front. Hey. Oh, hey. How's it going? Oh, really? Um, let me just think for a sec. Um, why don't you start off by putting like- Just put 60 back into the fund. Uh-Huh. Um- Sell it at 55. All right. I mean, when was the last time you got laid? Since you broke up with Debbie? That's fucking two years ago, dude. You need to get on something. Man, I don't know what happened to you. Last year, you were a fucking genius. King came up with the best concept of the year Well, it's- Now you can't even get out of bed? But you gotta go all the way. You took your fuckin' 90% and now you're checkin' out. You own 18% of this company. Do you know how much money that is? That's not courtside seats. That's buying the fucking N.B.A. team. And you're sittin' home jerkin' off, watchin' porn? Dude, I got a hundred engineers at M.I.T. who'd take your place in a minute. Go get one. Yeah, right. Not so fast. We got until 2:00. You're right. I don't wanna rush it. Here's where we goof the map, Out past the power lines, up that little sideroad without a sign, Hidden from the main street. The keepers of the ancient future, the keepers of the drama. They don't preserve it. They live it. Hey. Hey. I'll be right there. So you don't seem to be too unhappy, then. Why would I be unhappy? I don't know. You were pretty reluctant to get into all this. Well, it's not every day a girl gets to eat oysters... In a suite in Vegas with Dick Longman. You have no regrets, then? Don't be silly. I'm having a fine time. Me too. Do you have a secret fantasy? Uh, not really. Come on. Come on. Everybody has a secret fantasy. Uh, three days in Vegas with a beautiful woman. That's it? Yeah. There's nothing that you always wanted but you never asked for? Tell me. Really? Yeah. Really. The chinese call that "fire and ice. " No! There's a name for it? That's cold. Oh, my God. Oooh! Aaah! Aah! Do you want me to stop? I'm okay. No, stop, stop, stop, stop. Six days away from the I.P.O., okay? Mm-Hmm. You gotta keep it together. I know. This is what we talked about a year ago. You're a rock star. You raised this money. You had the best "B" to "B" concept in the world. All right? Okay. This is serious cash. Right. Don't burn yourself out on quake and playing stocks. Okay. I need you to be together for Tuesday. Okay. Come in early. How early? Like before lunch. Thank you. Florence, you up? Good morning. Good afternoon. Why? What time is it? I ordered up some coffee. You want some? Um, yeah. Just - just give me five minutes, okay? Okay. I worked parttime at Wal-Mart. Went to college. Mm. What'd you study? Quantum physics. Wow. Really? Yeah. You know, black holes and big bangs. Yeah, I know. Seriously? No. Come on. What'd you really study? Doesn't matter. I didn't finish. - You know what I studied? - What? Computer science. Really? No. I did work as a locksmith... When I first came to L.A. What do you mean, cutting keys and installing locks? I was a locked car specialist. Can't you just use a coat hanger for that? Yeah, you can. But only if the car was built before 1982. Some of these new lock systems are so complicated I had to take a special training course. They have all these tools, like the swan key. It's like a bird. That's a pretty strange job for a girl, isn't it? Actually, it's mostly women that do it. I mean, the company likes to hire women because they don't panic the way men do. They can handle the pressure. What pressure? Think about it. No, usually there's nobody in the car. But sometimes people get locked in their cars, And people get really freaked out when they're locked in a small space. Okay, but can't you just open the lock from the inside? Well, what about a dog? Can a dog unlock a door? One time I had to get this poodle out of a Mercedes. And it was during this heat wave a couple years ago. And this woman kept screaming at me that Winston was gonna die. The dog's name was Winston Churchill. It was a really tricky lock, and I was working on it. And she - She kept grabbing on to my arm and telling me to hurry up. I wanted to punch her. One time... I arrived at this car early in the morning, And there was a man trapped inside- An old man. He'd been in there all night. He had Alzheimer's. He thought it was Chicago and it was 1932. God. When I finally got him out, he was so dehydrated he had to drink six glasses of water. The scariest one - There was this time I was driving... Home, actually. I don't think I was working. And I came across this accident that had just happened. There was nobody there. So I called 911, And I went over to the car wreck... And there was this woman trapped in the car. But I didn't wanna leave her in the car, you know. She was unconscious. I couldn't tell... if she was really badly hurt or what was going on. And I started to work on the lock to try and get her out. It was just her and I, and I kept looking at her through the glass thinking, I could save her life. You have the bad gun again. Just keep moving. No. Keep going. Okay. Okay. Don't back away. But if you die, aren't you just dead? I mean, how can you keep going if you can die? Just try and pick up that big gun because- - I didn't know that. - You've got it again. But I didn't pick it up. It just - Aaah! Oh, my God! I killed him! No, that was you. No, no, no, I was doing so good. Hold on, hold on. You were doing okay. You're pretty good, actually. Seriously, you're pretty good. No, I know. I'm really good. No, for a beginner you're pretty good. For like the first time - here, you should let me help you. You should let me help you. You should let me help you. No. No. Let me take - let me- Come in. Hey. Hey. I'm going out for a couple of hours, so I'll see you later, all right? Where you going? I'm going to visit an old friend of mine, Jerri. I didn't know you had a friend here. Mm-Hmm. What does he do? She - She's a dealer at Caesar's Palace. Oh. Wait. Can I come? Check out my little guy, right? Oh, my god! That's my son Jacob. Oh. He's so big. He's almost five. Can you believe it? No. I'm telling you, he is so smart. Let me see. Yeah, he's brilliant. Know all the moms say that and everything but I'm telling you he is. Is he still with your mom? Yeah, I - I'm gonna go see him the day after tomorrow. So, I saw this movie the other night on cable -This black and white movie. I'm telling you, it totally got me. There's this guy, he's in a hospital during, like, some war. And he can't remember who he is. And he meets this girl and they fall in love and it's all really great, right? They get married. Everything is fabulous. He has to go to this other town for a job interview. Mmm! And he's walking across the street, he gets hit by a car. And he's a lord. Yeah, he- Yeah- He wakes up the person he was, which is, like, a lord or something. And he can't remember who he is now. Ronald Coleman and... Greer Garson. Um, she's his secretary? And-and- And she never tells him! Exactly. For 15 years- for 15 fucking years she never says anything. No, it's unbelievable. You feel like maybe- I don't know- Maybe love never dies. Maybe love never does. Ring, ring. Oh, should you get it? Maybe you should get it. Shh. Ring, ring. She doesn't know you're here. - Hello? - Hello, Richard? Oh, hang on one second. I'll get him. Uh, hey, how's it goin'? Richard, is that you? Can I conference in? I feel left out. Yes, it is. I have a banana and everything. Yes, it is, Florence. What are you doing? I don't know. I'm just hanging out with my friend here. Who are you with? No one. Um-Who are you with? Do you wanna come over and play? You've gotta go eat. You've gotta go eat? Eat everything. This is the only town in the world where... The breakfast get bigger billing than the entertainers. Down the strip a little bit you're gonna see "steak and eggs," eight-Foot letters. And underneath, "in the lounge, I'm really hungry. Frank Sinatra, jr. And his orchestra. " Little tiny letters. You gotta have glasses to read 'em. Richard? Brian. I heard you went AWOL on Pete. Yeah, I know. I know. Um- This is Florence. Um, Brian. Brian. Pivano. Pleased to meet you, mr. Pivano. It's nice to meet you, miss- Tremain. Florence Abigail Tremain. - My friends call me Abby. - I guess he's not a friend, huh? Richard is a man of discretion. We are business partners, after all. He would never presume to take liberties. You wanna have a seat? Yeah. Yeah, we've been working together for- What is it- Like... eight months or something? Nine months, Richard. Nine months. Brian and I went to college together. Where you working now? I'm over at Siltel. So, uh, what sort of business are you two in? Women's clothing. We deal exclusively on the internet. We're in Las Vegas this weekend doing research for our new line. We deal in speciality items, Erotic fantasy garments, Latex dresses and whatnot. We're called love factory dot com. Underwear, Richard? Yeah, it was a big opportunity, Brian. Every woman has a fantasy, Brian. Most women are too shy to walk into a store And tell the clerk what they want. O we're supported largely through advertising We've had quite a few hits in the first - Women want to feel desired. And men love it when their women make that extra effort to be desirable. After all, Without sex, none of us would be born. And we are all born out of a woman's cunt. It is the center of the world. And the more we can do to glorify that holy spot, The more we're doing for mankind. Oh, sister, when you said that word - I believe it was "cunt"- I thought he was gonna choke on his drink. Telling it like it is, Sugar. A cunt is a cunt is a cunt. No, don't do that. No, no, no. Excuse me! Mink bras, sable panties. Beaver beaver covers. Furs for your fur. Fox for your box. Oh, chinchilla clit warmers. Chinchilla clit warmers. Come on. Oh, fuck. What am I doing? Oh, it's okay, it's okay. No, it's okay. No. No. Hey, it's okay. Oh, fuck. It's okay.

Hey- I can't understand what you're saying. Okay, li- Listen, why don't you just come up here? No, we're here. He just fucking lost it, you know. He started dragging me around by my hair, and h-He- He- He slammed my head into the wall. He was pulling at it like he wanted my head to come off my neck. Who? Who is this guy? He's a really nice guy. Yeah. I've known him for a while. He comes to see me, like, like, uh, two or three times a year. And, uh, he comes all the way from- From, like, Scranton fuckin' Pennsylvania. Where'd you meet him? Uh, at work. He, uh, sat down at my table and didn't get up for three days. Oh, god. Look, he's a really- He's a really lonely guy with a lot of extra cash, And he's crazy about me. He even sent my mom... A birthday present last year. He's never been violent before. I mean never. I- I couldn't see it coming. Wh-What are you doing? Trying to support Jacob and my mom. That's what I'm doing. Why did he hit you? What did you do? I, uh, I-I didn't... Do anything, okay? No, I didn't mean- I didn't mean "what did you do?" I mean, what happened that he would hit you? Um, Mr. Doyle... Likes to fuck me up the ass. And, uh, one night a couple years ago... He did it to me hard. I mean, really hard. And it just- It did something to me, you know. When his cock was inside me, it just got me going... In this major way. And as I was coming, I felt like I had to pee. And all of the sudden, I am having this orgasm like I have never had before, And all this stuff starts shooting out of me, like a guy shooting his load. Oh, my god. This turns him on. Fuck, yeah. He knows I'm not faking it. But, you know, the thing is, I can't control it, And tonight I couldn't do it. It's the second time in a row that's happened. First time he was really nice. And this time he just went fuckin' ape-Shit. Oh, sweetheart. I'm sorry. He took all my fucking money too He ripped into my purse like a piece of meat... And took his $2,000 back. I was gonna go to Tacoma, you know, to see- And now I can't afford the trip. I can't see Jacob now. I can't - Hey. Don't worry about the money. The money's no problem. I can just transfer the funds into your account. I can't take your money. Hey. Of course you can. Look at me. Of course you can. You're a friend of Florence's. Florence is a friend of mine. Seriously, it's no problem. Take it, Jerri. It's fine. Take it. What planet did he come from? I'm still trying to figure that out. And do you know your account number?
