Al owes me a favor. That's why he's hooking us the tabs, okay? That's it. I got you this. That's sweet. Thank you. - It's just a fucking cake. - I know. Where are you going? One man's trash is another man's treasure, my friend. Especially if that one man is a rich prick. I can't believe we're leaving tonight at 9. You don't have to clean until the Saturday before we get back. - But that's four weeks. - Exactly. It's okay. Terrence and me watch the house. I know you will.

You know this is one of the most expensive liquors in the world? Enjoy it. Should we be doing this? I mean, it's their house. Tonight... ...we don't worry. - About what? - About anything. We're not gonna worry about what we're gonna eat... ...where we'll sleep... ...who's got drugs, how we're gonna make money, where the cops are. Not tonight. Tonight, we celebrate. Sounds good. Cheers. Oh, that's gross. Gross? It's cognac. It's the nicest shit you can buy. It tastes like shit. What would you prefer? A nice, cheap whiskey or something? Yeah. Yeah, okay. They have everything. That's what I'm hoping. Wow, that's so cool. Wow, that telescope's probably worth a grand, alone. Wow, look at that bathtub. You should go for it, man. - What? - Take a bath. It looks awesome. Why not? I'm gonna look around and make some food... ...and some drinks. - Go on, go for it. - Okay. Holy... Boy, Happiest Family in the Universe goes to these fucks. Jesus Christ. All right. Tricky, tricky. David. Silverman. Evelyn. Shit. Interesting. - Hey. - Hey. Dude, you're not gonna believe the shit I found downstairs. Awesome. I'll be out in a minute. Just feels really good in here. Cool. I am gonna figure you out. I've got good news and even better news. Jesus. How'd you do that? What do you think? You look rich. Feel like it. Found money. Seriously, how'd you do that? Bet you didn't think I could look like this. - Did you think you could look like this? - Honestly, no. But feels pretty good. It looks pretty good. - You're next. - No. - Come on, you have to. - Why? All right, fine. I'll do it. Just... - ...go watch TV or something. - Okay. - And don't come in here. - I won't. Video. TV. Home movies. No way. Hello. - Welcome home, little baby. - Everybody meet our son... ...Michael Silverman. - Isn't he cute? - You meet him too. Can you say, "Happy Halloween"? Happy Halloween. - Ready to get some candy? - Are you guys ready to get some candy? Come on, you guys look great. - Hi. - Hi, Dave. Hi, son. Hi. Ready? Try to hit it. Yeah! Are you kidding? You're a natural. Do you realize that? You're gonna be famous and rich. You're so good. Okay, Mr. Silverman, Mr. College Graduate. What's next? Well, Mr. Silverman, I think the next step would be graduate school. But not right away. You have all the time in the world. Three, two, one. It's a video camera, Dad. What you watching? Jonas. Found the suit upstairs. Turns out I'm a 40 regular. You look amazing. Thanks. - Let's go out. - What? Come on. - Hang on. - Why? Oh, my God! Jonas, why here? We shouldn't be here. Relax. No one is gonna recognize us. Come on, look at us. Relax, you'll be fine. - For two? - Yes, sir, si. Thank you. Right this way, please. Enjoy. Every night, when we would hit the market next door... ...I'd see these people in here. I'd see what they'd order... ...and see them drinking their fine wine. Damn it, that's what we're gonna have tonight. - Yeah. - Fuck, I always wanted to eat here. - Good evening. - Hello. Have you been here before? No. Oh, may I suggest for you the tasting menu? Is that what they're having? No, they're having a special menu prepared by the chef. Okay, we'll have that as well. Also comes with excellent wine pairings. Great, we'll have the same. Absolutely, sir. You will be beyond satisfied. That's what we want. Are you crazy? - I swear that guy is famous... - For fuck's sake, people are gonna... - What? People are gonna stare? - Yeah. - They're gonna talk? - Yeah. - They're gonna arrest you? - Yes. Right. For what? You don't get it, do you? We've got all the markings. We've got the fine cars and the fine clothes. Yeah, but they didn't steal it. Yeah, they did. Because if they didn't work for it, they stole it. What? Please, just try and relax. Just enjoy it, like they do. Okay. Hey. It's funny. I've got $1000 right here in my pocket. - I want you to hang onto it. - No. - Come on, hold it. - Why? When was the last time you held 1000 bucks in your hand? Come on, feels good, doesn't it? That was the best meal I ever had. - It was pretty good. - What? If that wasn't the best meal you ever had, then who the fuck are you? Fine, the best meal ever. It was, right? Yeah. Keep it down. That's beautiful. It's this thing my dad used to play. Sounds sad. Would you prefer this? Yeah, yeah! Right on! Shit. Get the lights. Why did you bring me here? I had to. Those guys, they could've fucked you up. You could've left me on the boardwalk or something. I could've. You didn't. No. So why? What, you want me to spell it out for you? I can take care of you. I like taking care of you. I don't need you to take care of me. I can take care of myself. No, Jonas. No, stop. Get off. I can't. What the hell? - Thought you wanted to fuck. - I don't want to fuck. I'm sorry. I don't know what's wrong with me. All right, ready? Do it again. Ready? Great effort. Great job waiting for it. No splashing Mommy. It's day one, guys. We got a whole summer. Go, go, go! Stephanie, get it! Yeah! Go! Not bad. Not bad. - That was pretty good. - He didn't get you. No. Oh, shit. Hey. Stay back. - Who is it? - I don't know. Okay. Hey. Just go along with whatever I say. - Okay. - Don't fuck this up. Hey. Sorry, you scared me. Yeah, I gotta get into the garage. Sorry, who are you? Who am I? Where's Evelyn? - They're on vacation. - We're family. - Oh, yeah? - Yeah. Evelyn's brother's kids. We're taking care of the house while they're away. Yeah, I forgot. They went to Greece or something. Yeah. I'm Sarah. This is my brother, Adam. - Hi. - Right on. Terrence. I work for them. Handyman. Totally spaced that they were gone. That's cool. I guess just wash the cars or whatever a few days before they get back. We don't need anything, right? - Yeah, August, right? - I think so. - Can't remember the date. - It's written down. - Late August sounds right. - All right. Hey, late August, it is. - See you. - Take it easy. - Think that worked? - Yeah. But what about the neighbors... The neighbors haven't seen us yet, and they're not going to, so relax. - I need to start unloading this stuff. - What stuff? Stuff. The cars, paintings, the jewelry. That's why we're here. Okay. There's one ring you can't hock. It's David's father's ring. It's the only thing he has to remember him by. What's it look like? It's gold, it's black onyx, has the initials R.S. on it. - How do you know all this? - The videos. - What videos? - The home videos. Okay. I need to go and talk to this guy. - Just promise me? - I won't sell this ring. I gotta go. Okay. I'm just gonna stay here. Do whatever the hell you want. - Here you go, man. - For real? Yeah. Holy shit! - What? - What do you think, huh? - What? How did you...? - It's a long, funny story, my friend. You a cop or some shit? This is some Miami Vice bullshit. No. Come on, get in. I wanna talk to you. Yeah, I'm getting in, brother. Come on. - Shit. - All right. - Listen up, man. - What's up? I found a lot of shit to sell. Big shit, shit like this. - Where that shit at? - In Malibu. Gotta see that shit. Not yet. I can't. Gotta lay low. Look. I wanna give you a cut of what I sell... ...if you know somebody big-time, enough to handle this. - I know somebody. - You know somebody? You sure? - Yeah. - All right, what's he into? Into coke, but I think he's in some other shit. - What kind of other shit? - This kind of other shit, man. All right. Well, look, can you set it up for tonight? Yeah. Yeah. Get the fuck out of my car. Set it up for tonight. Some big-time. - You and me. - This is flashy. You look fly, brother. Come on! Tonight, brother. Hi, Carol. Oh, my baby. Is that my little girl? Well, goddamn, look at you. - You look so beautiful. - What's going on? What'd you do? - What'd I do? - I'm just so happy you're home. - Shut up. What'd you come here for? - To see Mom. - Baby, what...? Did you get married? - Yeah. I was gonna invite you, but it happened so quick. In Maui. - Where? - Hawaii, Wilerd. We were climbing this volcano. We got to the top, he proposed, and I said yes. - Right there on top of a volcano. - That's what I said. What's this one's name? - Michael Silverman. - Michael. - I think you're full of shit. - I don't care. We sacrificed everything for you. We raised you. Yeah, you raised me up, didn't you, Wilerd? - If you're gonna talk like that, we'll leave. - It's time you give back a bit. - Where's Bobby? - I don't know. Why, here he is, here he comes. Bobby! Hi. Hi, Bobby. Come here. Hi. - Where have you been? - In L.A. - Really? - Yeah. I just moved into a house. - Come visit soon. - Does it have a pool? No. But it's close to the ocean. - Can I go now? - Honey, no. No, you have to go to school, but I'll visit really soon, okay? Bobby, get away. She ain't your real sister. She's foster trash. Shut up, Wilerd. Get on back in the house. Here. Go have some fun, okay? Don't turn into an asshole like Wilerd. - You heard me, boy! - Enough! Get in. Mom, here. - Oh, no. No. - Buy yourself something nice. Listen. You know I love you like you're my own child. You know that. Yeah. I gotta go, okay? I'll come back, okay? I'll bring Michael. I want you to meet him, all right? - Will you do that? Please? - I will, Mom, I swear. Hey. Well, I set it up. - Selling all of it. - But not the ring. No, not the ring. When? I'm meeting the guy tonight, so we'll see. I wanna do this fast. Scared we're gonna get busted up here. Pushing our luck. Okay. - You can fantasize that we belong here... - I said okay, all right? This could be it, Kell. A score this big, it could change everything for us. You're really smart, Jonas. You'll pull it off. - Who the fuck are you? - Oh, man, we good. - We're here to see Ronald. - Who are you? I'm Al. Ronald's my man. I sold him some shit. And? No, that's... Just go ask him. I'm telling you, he knows me. - I'm coming... Come on, man. - Come on. Yeah. Down there. - I can't see him, man. - Straight ahead. You have company. What's up? It's Al. Who? Sold crack to you on Venice... Motherfucker! Okay. Who's the suit? Am I being audited? - That's my man. - Should we roofie him? Come on. He's not like that... My name is Jonas. I have a lot of items for sale. - Al thought of you. - He did? Well, let's go take a gander. - Sunshine. - Let's go gander. Ladies, your hot, sugar daddy cock will be back. So in addition to the Cayenne there's a 2010 Carrera... ...loaded, mint. And this collection of watches and jewelry... ...some of which are antiques. Show me the jewels. I have price evaluations for these items and the Kelley Blue Book on the cars. Oh, I love it. - It'll look great on you. - Right? Yeah. Oh, my God. - Oh, wait. That... - It's my initials. Oh, I simply, absolutely must have this. I'll take the whole lot. How much do you want? Thirty thousand for the jewels, 70,000 for the cars. One hundred thousand dollars. None of these items will be reported stolen for a week. You can clean the cars, put a fresh coat of paint on them, triple your money. Then why don't you do it yourself? Because I have bigger business in Arizona. I can take one of the cars, maybe the Carrera... I want the Carrera. I love the Carrera. I'm keeping the Carrera. I love the German cars. And I'll give you 50 for the rest. And if you're a smart wee laddie... ...you'll take it. I am smart, so no less than 80. Okay. But if you're fucking with me... ...if you're lying to me... - Ronald, I wouldn't bring someone by... - Alistair, do shut up. I don't know you from fucking Adam. I wouldn't let you suck my dick... ...let alone vouch for this smooth operator. No, I'm just saying that he... All right. If you fuck with me... ...I will kill you. And feed you to the coyotes. Do we have a deal? Yes, sir. Excellent. Bravo! How's my hair look? Nice. Haven't you ever wanted to dance like a 14-year-old at a sleepover? - No, man. - Well, then, get out! Sorry. Get out! Right. Okay. To my dad. He would have been 85 years old today... ...and he taught me... ...all there was to know about love and loss and... - To Pop. - To Pop. - Stephanie. - What? What, I'm fine. I'm fine. Stop, Mom. Stop. Oh, look, there's a camera. - Look, Mom, smile. Smile. - That's enough. Hey, Steph, you got a little something on your face. - Michael. Turn it off. - I'm fine. I'm just high. Are you going to bless the meal? Michael, turn off the camera. Okay. Here's a thousand. Just like that? There's another 3 when the deal is done. That's 5 percent. Look at you, man. You ain't from the streets. What's that mean? How you know how to do all this shit? Might've just got lucky. So did you, huh? Word. So tomorrow at 12. - Yeah. - All right, man. All right. Go to work tonight, buddy. Michael, can you tell the driver to take my bags upstairs, please? Michael, did you hear me? Smells like smoke in here. Michael, did you let someone stay here while we were gone? No. He wouldn't do something like that. What the hell is going on here? Will someone call Terrence and ask him if he stayed over? He wouldn't do that. Well, if not him, who? We've been robbed. Check my jewelry. It's gone. All of it. And your father's ring? It's gone. Mom... ...where's your car? We've been robbed. What? Okay. Hey. How much to fuck you, right now? Can't do it, baby. No? Come on, everyone's got a price. My girl's got a price. I've got a price. So what's yours? Two thousand. Cash. - Done. - Come on, baby. Oh, fuck. Shit. Shit. - What happened? - They came home. - I know. - Where the fuck were you? - Where was I? I was setting shit up. - Too late now, isn't it? Fuck. Did you sell the ring? - What ring? - Oh, you did. You bastard. - I didn't sell the ring. - Liar. - I don't give a fuck about that ring, okay? - I did. Okay, great. Well, I don't give a fuck about you. Pull over. - No, look, I'm sorry... - Pull over. All right, look, I'm sorry. I didn't mean it. - Fuck you. - I'm sorry! Just thank God you weren't pinched. - They're gonna figure it out, Jonas. - They probably have. - Car's gonna be hot in less than an hour. - Ditch it. I can't. This is the only thing I have left in this deal. I just need to find another one of these and change the plates. That's it. Change the plates. Order me a coffee. I'll be back. I just need to freshen up a little. Thanks. - Hi. Could I get one to see The Kid? - Hi. Sure. Nine dollars. It's an old print. They break sometimes. Yeah. Excuse me. Miss. You don't look like a big Charlie Chaplin fan. A fan? That's a pretty old film. Yeah. I didn't think it would be that sad. Do I know you from somewhere? - I don't think so. - I'm Michael. Kelly. Hi, Kelly. Do you drink coffee, Kelly? Yeah. - But I think I should go. - Please? - Oh, I gotta go... - Come on. I'll tell you how the film ends. Okay. Okay? Come on. This is really great, you know? What? A beautiful girl went to see a Charlie Chaplin movie. What's so great about that? Girls like you get into bars without waiting. They don't go to old black and white movies on the big screen by themselves. You don't know me. Oh, yeah? So who are you? I'm nobody. I should go. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to make you feel uncomfortable. At least let me walk you home. It's late. I'm fine. Well, will you let me give you a ride? - Is this yours? - Yeah. It drives better than it looks. I got a surprise for you. It's beautiful, isn't it? Yeah. I love it up here. I used to come here a lot. Why not anymore? Part of another life. - Sorry, I didn't mean to bring up anything. - It's okay. It's over now. Do you have a girlfriend? No. I did. We broke up about a year ago. Why? She just couldn't handle it. Handle what? I had a sister... ...but she died about three years ago. I'm sorry. It's okay. She got into drugs. Lot of people do. Yeah. It's crazy. If you would've met Steph, you'd never think that she'd... It just happens. Sometimes you don't know what's gonna hook you until you try it, then it's too late. Yeah, I guess. Oh, shit. Wake up. Wake up. Shit. Shit, shit, shit. Sorry. I'm so late. Shit. Come on. I'm so late. I'm sorry. I have to meet my dad all the way downtown. Are you hungry? You can help yourself to the fridge... ...or take a shower, anything, okay? - I won't be gone very long. - Thanks. - Okay. I gotta go. You good? - Yeah. - You sure? - Yeah. Okay. Will you have dinner with me tonight? - Sure. - Yeah? Okay. Okay. Okay. Bye. Thank you. That's it. That's Wong's factory. The Chinese order is confirmed. That's great. I just wish we didn't have... ...to come all the way back home to get that done, but... Is there any news on the house? Yeah. Yeah. They said that it was not uncommon. You know, things are bad... ...and these things happen. Terrence got a good look at them. - Wait, what? - Yeah. He spoke to them. Said they were a very nice looking young couple. They called themselves Adam and Sarah, your cousins. - They did their homework. - You're kidding? And he, the kid, knew what he was doing. He got my passwords, he got into my files, he got my gun. - The old six-shooter. - Yeah. Surprised he didn't blow his hand off. It's all right. Everything's insured. Except for my father's ring. Shit. Sorry, Dad. Wait a minute. She came into the theater and sat down right next to you? Didn't sit down right next to me. She was the only person in there. - To see The Kid? - Yeah. - Unbelievable. - I know, right? Well, she sounds pretty interesting. Yeah, she's... She's interesting. And? And... - ...we're having dinner tonight. - Yeah. That's the way it starts. - What's that? - Love. - Dad. Come on. - No, that's the way love starts. How do you know it's love, though? Well... ...for someone to find true love in their twenties, that's rare. So if it's not true love, at least it's great practice. And if it is true love... ...then it's a blessing. And you can't ignore that. - Hi. Can I get a one way to Barstow? - Fifty-five. I'm sorry. I tried. Hey. You okay? Yeah. I'm good. What are your plans today? I don't know. Will you spend the day with me? This is nice. What? I love spending time with you. Will you go to dinner with me tonight? Okay. At my parents' house? Yeah, I know it sounds weird. It's a Passover dinner. It's a religious thing... ...but it'll be fun. I don't know. I don't think that's a good idea. Why not? I don't know. I... Listen. You have nothing to worry about. They're really nice. And I just... I'd like you to meet them. Please? Let me think about it, okay? Okay. Ronald, what's up? Where the bloody hell is my Porsche Carrera? Look, there was a bit of a problem. But here's what I'm gonna do, okay? I'm gonna sell you the Cayenne for half and then we'll just call it even. Cool? Are you fucking kidding me? No, it's a good car. I wouldn't give that car to my mother. Do I look like a soccer mommy? - "Get in the back of the car, kids." - No. - We made a deal... - I know. ...for the Porsche Carrera. There was a problem, all right, man? I'm sorry. I can sell you this for half. - You believe this guy, Sammy? - Well, it's a good car. Go on, sunshine. Oh, whoa, hey, hey. No, no, no, please don't. I can get it. I can get you the car. I'll get it. - I will take a finger... - No. ...for every day that you do not bring me my Porsche Carrera. No, please, I'll get it. I'll get the Carrera, I'll get it. I'll get it. - Told you not to fuck with me, right? - Yes, and I won't. - Yeah? Did I not? - I'll get it, I'll get it. Not so fucking shiny and smooth now, are you, motherfucker? Okay. Okay, I'll get it. Please don't, please don't. Please don't, no. Fuck! Be warned, you little cunt! I'll get it. I'll get you the car. Didn't they shoot Grease here, Sammy? You know, boss, I think they did. - You on your way yet? - We're leaving. Well, don't be late. I will not be late, I promise. - Michael, love you. - I love you too. Bye. - Can I help you with anything? - No. - Jeez. - Actually... You ready? Can you pour me a glass of wine? Are you nervous? Of course, I'm meeting your parents. They're gonna love you. I'm not Jewish. - Don't know anything about Passover. - That's okay. Hey, look at me. It's gonna be fine. It's just a party. How bad could it be? - Okay. - It's gonna be fine. Let's go. Perfect. - He's excited. - He sounds mature. - Like I did when I first met you. - Mature? Are you good? Hey, Dad. Happy Pesach to you. Happy Pesach, Dad. This is Kelly. Kelly, my father, David. Happy Pesach to you. It's such a great pleasure to meet you. Please, come in. Thank you. - It's nice, huh? - It's amazing. Michael. Thanks. - I don't suppose you'd... - Sure I will. - Really? - Yeah. All right. - I like you more and more. - Thanks. When did you have your first cigar? When? I was 31. I was hanging out with some guys who liked to smoke. It wasn't the taste and it wasn't the smoke. It was the idea, you know? That that's what they did at the top. And that's what I wanted. I wanted to be right at the top. Looks like you made it. Almost. Almost, kiddo. Come, come. Wow, look at that. Yeah, look at that. You know the drill. We record everything. - Everything. - Everything. That's great. It's been a while. It's a good occasion. It's a great occasion. And it's great to have you with us. Thank you. All right, well, let's get to the Hebrew... ...the lamb shank, wicked child, all that stuff. No, we can skip all that tonight. Let's just make this about the family... ...and the love that's at this table. And I guarantee you, in 20 years... ...you'll understand how important that is. - Come on, Dad. - It's okay. A lot of people don't have this. You have a beautiful family and it's great to be part of it tonight. Thank you. Okay, Michael, why don't you go to the door and invite Elijah in? Elijah is a prophet. He represents everyone who is in need and is always welcome. Yeah, and he looks like Superman with a big star on his chest. - Come on. - All right. It's been too long. Go in there. Mike? - Please, don't. - Sit down. You shut up. I'm not who you were expecting, huh? Please don't point my gun at anyone. - Please. - Your gun? This isn't your gun anymore, okay? I'm so sorry to interrupt dinner, all of you looking so... ...so presentable. But, you know, from the outside, you never see the whole truth. Please, you can have anything you want. Hey, take it easy. - How about instead I pull this trigger? - Jonas. Jonas, you win, okay? This has nothing to do with you. You're full of shit. - Do you know this person? - Yeah. Yeah. - Yeah. - It was you? Wait, Michael. - It was you two? - I'm sorry. - You lied to me? - Yeah. - You lied to me and you set us up. - No. - Yeah, something like that, man. - No. This was all a fucking con? You know what, man? It's called survival. - In the real world, it's called survival. - Jonas. I don't know what a con is anymore. - You are not who you say you are. - Don't know what you're talking about. I am so sick of you and your family and your fucking house. Then get the fuck out. No. - Sit down. - You can have anything you want. Whatever I want? - I want your car. - Okay. The Porsche. The Carrera. Great. Kelly, now we go. Kelly. Just leave. - I'm sorry. - Just leave. - I'm sorry, I didn't... - Kelly. Up. What the hell did you think you were trying to pull back there? Be one of them, be nice and pretty and rich? Well, you're not. You are shit, Kelly. You're trash, like me. The question is, what the fuck you're gonna do now... ...after I've made the deal and I'm sitting pretty in Mexico... ...off the grid and you're up here running from cops? Because they'll never let you go. That's how it works in this world. Here. Sammy, check it out. You got a bathroom? It's a fucking house, we have the whole jamboree... - Don't need bathroom, we're leaving. - Fuck you. I need to take a piss. Oh, firecracker. - Is she negotiable too? - No, she's not. - She's with me. - I'm not with you. My price is fixed, it's too high for Jonas. Do you think I can afford you? You think I can take a piss? Sure, down the stairs on the left. What a cunty little minx she is. 911, what's your emergency? There's a robbery taking place at 734 Sycamore in Hollywood. They have guns, they're going to kill me. Stay with me. I'm sending a police car now. What's your name? - Here's our little delight. - Let's go. I thought about it. And I want a new daddy. I want him to keep me safe and warm at night. - Nice ring. - Oh, yes, thank you. That's me, Ronald Smythe, at your service. Kelly, what the fuck are you doing? She's getting me fucking hard, that's what she's doing. Very cute. Now, hand it back. It's not your ring. Excuse me? - Were you not listen... - You're a liar. - Don't pull this shit. - So are you. Give back the ring. If I were you, I'd listen to your friend. Spit the ring out. No? Okay. Hey, come on, she'll give it back. Give it back to me. Come on, now. - Let's have it. - Come on. Spit it out. Spit my fucking ring out or you will be spitting fucking blood. Spit it out! Spit it out. Give it to Daddy. What are we gonna do with this little trollop, huh? Just don't hurt her, all right? A naughty girl, that's what you are. - I came a bit then. - Give it back to him now. How's that hanging, yeah? How you feeling there? It's good? You staying strong? - Stop it! - "Stop it!" You're a brave one. You're a very brave girl. You women are all the same. You're all cunts. You're all cunts. - That's it. I have a gun to your head! - Perfect. I got a gun to your head! I love you. You hear me? I will fucking kill you! - Shoot this motherfucker. - Freeze, police! Gun. - Detective Matthews. - Mrs. Silverman, how are you? - Good. - You look lovely today. Thank you. David. - Hey. - Mr. Silverman. Well, I am happy to report that we recovered your belongings. Really? Two cars and looks like a lot of jewelry. How did you manage to do that? Get this, Bonnie and Clyde had a little bit of a falling out. She ratted him out, called 911 from the bathroom. It was crazy, big shoot-out. But she definitely paid the price. - What are you talking about? - She's in ICU. - What hospital? - What...? - The girl, what hospital? - County Hospital. Michael. Hi, I'm looking for Kelly Tanner. Kelly Tanner. Thank you so... Oh, Kelly. Is she gonna be okay? Doctor says she's gonna be fine. Family? No, I'm just a friend. - I'm not supposed to allow you in here. - Ma'am, please. Please. - Haven't seen anybody else coming in. - Thank you so much. Thank you. - Keep it short. - Okay. Oh, Kelly, I'm so sorry. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. That was the only thing she had on her. Wouldn't let go of it for dear life. Not even in her sleep. All right, this is her first ride. You can do it. Yeah, you can stand... Stephanie, stand. Push down with the right foot. Down with the left. Keep it straight. Look ahead at Mommy. Look straight ahead. You're doing it. You're doing it. - I got you. - Come on, come on, she's doing it. - Oh, my God, let go. - I'm not holding you. - I'm not even holding you. - Look, Ma, no hands. - Good girl, give me five. - I'm not holding you. That was so good, sweetie. Kelly. Hi. You look better. Kelly, this is my lawyer. Kelly, hi. - Hi. - I wanna talk about your confession. What about it? Well, Jonas' father is a very wealthy man... ...and he wants to help you to pay your medical bills... ...and to offer my counsel in your defense if you need it. Why would he do that? Because you would sign this testimony which states that... ...Ronald Smythe threatened Jonas' life... ...and forced him to rob the Silvermans at gunpoint. - That's bullshit. - You don't know that for sure, do you? You're such a coward. - Miss Tanner. - Go fuck yourself. - Will you step outside, please? - Jonas. Just give us a minute. Just take a walk. You remember you asked me one time how I wound up on the street? Yeah. It's because my dad kicked me out. Why? Because we hate each other. One night he took a swing at me after I got the tattoo... ...and he hit me so fucking hard it landed me in the hospital for a week. Sounds like an asshole. He is. That's why you gotta sign this document... ...and have him pay for your medical bills. I should probably sign it. But I can't. I'm not lying or cheating anymore. I'm telling the fucking truth in court. You're making a mistake. That's what I always do. Jonas Trumball? Fine of $50,000 and 200 hours of community service. I'd say you got off easy, Jonas. Wouldn't you? Thank you, Your Honor. Get out of my courtroom. Kelly Tanner. Yes? Breaking and entering, theft, six months sentence, no parole. Pleaded guilty. Turned yourself in. Do you think you belong here? It's the penalty, isn't it? For breaking the law, for lying, for stealing? Just let me pay it. Okay. See your parole officer on your first day. He or she can lay out the obligations of being on parole. They're easy. Stay out of trouble. I will. Kelly. Oh, I missed you. - Michael... - Hey, it's okay. It's okay, we'll figure it out, okay?
