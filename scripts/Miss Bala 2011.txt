Thanks. Can I help you with something? Hello. I'm looking for a dress. What's the occasion? For a beauty pageant. In our store, all of the dresses are custom-made. You won't find anything under $1000. Yeah, I have the money. Here is the green one you liked. - Thanks. - Let me know if you need anything else. Yes? Canelita, where are you? Here. Here, where? Everything okay? Do you need help? I'm sorry. I don't have anything! I didn't do anything! Go home. Where were you? - Where's Dad? - In his room. Where did you sleep? With Suzu. Be quiet. - Cover for me? - Yes. Open up. What's going on? What's wrong, Lau? Nothing. Are you okay? Yes. Why did you go away? Also, during the operation... ... two members of the criminal group La Estrella were captured. - Can you bring me something to eat? - Yes. - Alias Lino, was able to escape, his whereabouts... Little man, don't make noise. This is yet another run-in between the police and this criminal group... ... that started after they were identified as being responsible for leaving a vehicle... ... in front of the embassy containing the bodies of an agent... ... a federal police officer and a young woman, not yet identified. It has been General Salomn Duarte's primary agenda... ... after being named chief of police for the state... ... to combat the various criminal groups that are taking over the state of Baja California. Lino is thought to be one of the most active criminals in this state. He is suspected of being responsible for a recent attack in the Millennium nightclub... ... where the lives of 12 officers and civilians were lost. Did you go to school? No. - Why not? - He didn't take me. What have you been doing? Nothing. What's that? It's all I could find. Thanks. What happened to you? I fell down. Ouch, it hurts! Don't laugh. Arturo, get dressed. Open the door, fucker! Step back. - Step back, motherfucker. - Take anything you want. - Where is Laura, motherfucker? - Who is Laura? Do you want to die? Dad. I'm gonna fucking kill you. I know she's here. You son of a bitch, where is she? There's no one here, man. Dad. Go to your room. Go on! Turn off all the lights. Nobody goes near the windows. Wait, please. Come on! Arturo! Arturo! Come with me. Don't look back, okay? Stay in here. Everything is going to be okay. Goddamn it. Why the fuck did you run away? Do you see what happened? Fucking shit. Who the fuck took your phone? I don't know. Go to your room. How many of them were there? Like six or seven. What kind of trucks did they have? Black ones. What did they do to you? They hit me and took the phone. - What else? - Nothing. Move over. Cover that lamp. - Linito, where you at? - Copy. They took all our ammo. They also got Ventura. We had to run. They took over our hideout. Who the fuck did you go see? Nobody. Then why the fuck did you run away? Roquita. I'm in the clear. Everything is calm on this side. Got it. Cut the radios and start calling the U.S. All right, boss. We're fearless. I need you to run an errand for me. Did you hear me? Anything you want. Just let my brother go. You've got a deal. We're in the clear. Jimmy, Jimmy. We want three boxes. Ramn, open up. I've packed up some things for you. Don't say anything. If something happens, I'm going to pay for it. Wait, you go. Tell them I'll stay in your place. We can't do that. Take this. Don't be afraid, little man. I love you. Go on, leave. Linito, the man and the kid are escaping. Let them go. The boss says they can leave. Shut the fucking door! Lino wants you in your room. General Duarte, in today's press conference... ... gave a full report on the attack against the criminal group La Estrella. Something that can only be classified as a lucky hit. We've captured most members of the criminal group. We've taken most of their weapons and ammo... ... and we expect to have all of them captured before the weekend is over. Shut the door. Take off your robe. Put some clothes on. They've tapped our radios. I'm shutting down. - Give me a holler when we are ready. - You got it. To. Keep an eye on Chiquirris. I think he might be a rat. You got it, boss. That's enough. Turn off the light. Come here. Lay down here. Don't move. Be still. Hands up. Put these on. To. We're ready. Call Jimmy, we'll need three cases of bullets. Canelita. You're gonna bring back a truck. When you cross the border, go under the bridge. I'll be waiting for you there. Take a good look at these monkeys. Tell me who took your phone. This one. To, we know who did it. Call the taxi. The gringo is waiting for her. Okay, we're here. If they catch you with the money, tell them you don't know me. I have a family to feed. - Where are you heading? - To San Diego. - Who sent you? - Nobody. - What's the purpose of your visit? - I'm going shopping. I need your passport. Laura Guerrero, LG08714678. - She's clear, let her through. - Let her through. Let her through, move the truck. The chick got through. Your passport. Laura Guerrero, LG0871... She's clean, let her through. - Understand? - Yes. Stop, stop! Hurry, they're hitting us hard! Go get Canelita! - Get down! - Go get Canelita and the ammo! Get down, get down! Get her out, get her out! Get the girl inside, cover her! Let's get out of here! Go, go, go! Hop on! What did the gringo tell you? Kike Camara is in Tijuana. What else? He's under the name of Orlando Gomez. - That's it? - Nothing else. That gringo motherfucker. Okay, let's go. Get down, get down. Get in. We're almost there.

Her dream is to help her brother earn a college degree. A round of applause for Laura Guerrero. Good evening. Baja California is one of the most beautiful states in this country. But oftentimes, it's only known for its defects. I believe that with education, tolerance and respect... ...we can show everybody that this is a place full of light. Absolutely, this place is full of light. Let's hear it for Jessica Verduzco. Thank you very much. A stunning young lady. Her presence lights up the stage... ...the Miss Baja California stage. And now, Laura Guerrero. A 23-year-old from Tijuana. And here she comes, Laura Guerrero. How are you this evening? Fine, thank you. Laura, tell me, what do you desire most, wealth or fame?

If you wanna leave, then get the hell out. But you can't come back here again. You can't go to your house... ...or talk to anybody you know. Take this money. Walk straight for a couple of hours and you'll hit something. Go. Take off your clothes. Time for your interview, man. Name? Kike Camara. Name. Enrique Camara. Who do you work for? For the DEA.

They're going to introduce him... ...to you. You're gonna flirt with him. Later, he'll ask you to go to his room. Or he'll invite you somewhere else. What if he doesn't invite me? Just flirt with him and forget about the rest. You know what we need. We want to know when you're alone with him. Take this. We'll call you when you're inside. Don't hang up. Stay on the line. Come on, get out. Hurry, hurry. What's the purpose of your visit? My name is Laura Guerrero. I'm here for the Miss Baja event. - Hello, welcome. They're waiting for you. - Hello. - Where's the crown? - Thank you. Where were you? Why did you disappear? Smile. Don Salomn. General, how are you? - Luisa, it's a pleasure seeing you again. - Laura, come. I want you to meet Laura, the new Miss Baja California. She was crowned yesterday. Freshly crowned, and I must say she has a nice appearance. I'm at your service, general. Take a seat, have a drink with us. Thank you, very kind of you, but I have to return to my table. She's a hottie, general. - Look, you made the front page. - You look good in the picture. What time is the interview? Four o'clock p.m., but we have to arrive earlier for makeup. - Miss, from the general. - Thank you. Beauty Queen Overnight I'm going to give you this phone. Carry it at all times. You can't disappear like you did yesterday. You caused a lot of problems with the interviews. And you have to smile more often. What are the secretaries from the mayor's office doing here? Excuse me. Bodies left at the Embassy identified Yes. Yes. I'm Laura Guerrero. I'm here to see General Duarte. I have a Laura Guerrero here to see the general. Let her through. Go ahead. Please. - Look, it's that blind guy. - What blind guy? The one that sings. Sir, Miss Laura is here. All right. Come in, please. You have to get it together. What's important is that you send me some men that can stay with me. Make yourself a drink. Start getting undressed. That incident with the gringo has caused me serious problems. I have to issue a report very soon. They're gonna kill you. They're going to kill you. They're listening to us. Oh, yeah, baby, that's it. Open your legs. Stay calm. Go, go, go. Close off the area. Let's go, let's go. Make sure there's no one left in the rooms. They're all yours. We're all set. She's under the bed, get her out. Bring the girl over here. Fuck her up! Ready? - Sir, can I please make a phone call? - Sorry, babe, we're about to start. Let's go. Keep your head up, babe. The spokesperson for the attorney general will give us a detailed report... ...of yesterday's operation. In a joint effort... ...federal, state and local police... ...fought and defeated the criminal group known as La Estrella. In this operation, the lives of Captain Agustin Robles... ...and eight state policemen were lost... ...along with those of eight criminals. Among them, the leader of the group, Chalino Valdez, a.k.a. Lino... ...and one of his personal bodyguards Lorenzo San Martin, a.k.a. To. Also captured during the operation... ...Laura Guerrero, formerly Miss Baja California... ...allegedly responsible for parking the vehicle at the embassy... ...containing the bodies of Commander Fernandez, Agent Raymond Bell... ...as well as Azucena Ramos, civilian. I'm sorry. Forgive me. The stunning young lady on your screen, who was crowned Miss Baja California... ... has just been arrested. Her name is Laura Guerrero, she's from Tijuana, Baja California. They found her in possession of weapons, over 1000 cartons of ammo... ... and approximately $100,000. The young lady is being linked to the criminal group La Estrella... ... who were captured during an operation by federal and state police... ... where there was an attempt against General Salomn Duarte. She was the only woman captured amongst the powerful criminal group. I repeat, her name is Laura Guerrero. On the phone with us is Luisa Janes, pageant coordinator. Thank you for letting me voice my opinion. This is definitely a very delicate subject and a real shame. The actions of girls like her are a real embarrassment to Mexico. The Miss Baja California pageant condemns these actions. What's going on? What's going on? Let me go! THE MEXICAN DRUG WAR HAS CAUSED THE DEATHS... ...OF OVER 36,000 PEOPLE BETWEEN 2006 AND 2011.
