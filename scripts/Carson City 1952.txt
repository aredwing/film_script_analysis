All right, come on, everybody out. Don't try to be a hero, you won't get hurt. I'm too old to be a hero. Besides I'm broke. Please don't take this. It's a family heirloom. Take it easy, lady. We don't want anything from you. Here it is. Take it over there behind that Boulder. - What's the meaning of this? - Just a little stop for lunch. Wait a minute. That strongbox belongs to the golden state bank. They can have it back after we bust it open. Come and get it, folks! All right, get going. Pile into it. Well, I never saw anything like this. Help yourselves, ladies. Look at this... Real Harris linen. Never saw any better in Boston. Never saw men like that in Boston. Help yourself, partner. It's on the house. On the contrary, it's costing me $50,000. I thought it was bank money. It is and I happen to own the bank. I've always wanted to meet a bank president. Here, Mr. Sharon. Well, lookit here... Champagne. Have a snort? Well, perhaps just a little. Come on, let's go! All right, folks, on your way. You, too. I'd like to get the recipe for these eggs. They'll never believe this back in Boston. When I get back I'll have something to say about this. I guarantee you won't get away with it. "GOLDEN ELEPHANT MINE" "A. J. DAVIS & JIM SQUIRES". POSITIVELY NO ADMITTANCE. How'd it go? Sharon was on the coach. - Did he spot you? - No. I kept out of his way. Dump it down there, men, and get out. Hey, take it easy with that, clem. Those glasses cost 2 bucks apiece. You still don't go for that, do you? No, not when I pay for half of it... Champagne, chicken, Glasses that cost 2 bucks apiece. Cheapest insurance we could buy. Rob the poor, and you get a posse Of outraged citizens after you. Rob a mine owner, and nobody cares. Leave the passengers alone, Why go to all the expense to make a banquet? - Ever hear of Robin hood? - I didn't think so. Besides, I like champagne. That's what I always figured. At times you get too unhappy about it. Remember, we wouldn't be doing this if the mine were any good. Look, you're over 21. I didn't ask you to put your money in it. As long as I did, I intend to make it pay off. Better get that stuff put in our own cases. And tell the boys to keep smoke coming out of those chimneys. All right. We're supposed to be producing. These bandits not only made a picnic Out of stealing my bullion, but on top of that, They had the impudence to serve imported champagne! Take it easy, will. That lamp was imported, too... From Italy. I'm sorry, Charles, Whenever I think of these holdups there's only one way To put a stop to them, railroad through that territory. I understand how you feel. I can't build a railroad for you just to stop A few penny-ante highwaymen from robbing the stagecoach. It may be penny-ante to you, but it isn't to me. My bank has money tied up in the comstock area, The richest area in the country. You do as I tell you, And you'll have more business than you can handle. Well, maybe so, But right now the central pacific Is in no position to take on a job like that. How about it, ed? I've checked over the map. We can handle this from Reno to Carson city. From there to Virginia city would be prohibitive. But that's why I need it the most. That's where holdups occur. It's perfect bandit country. On this terrain, it would take 15 Miles of track to cover every 2 Miles. My advice is to forget it, sir. I didn't come here for advice. I'll make a deal with you. We'll handle the strip from Reno to Carson city if you'll build The tracks from Virginia city to Carson city first. If you think it's such a good investment for us, It ought to be a good one for your bank. Lend me one of your engineers, and I'll do it. I need my staff right where they are, But I know a good man... Jeff Kincaid. If he's so good, why isn't he still with you? He said it was getting too civilized around here. Last I heard, he was in Panama putting in the shortest Nastiest little roadbed in the world across the isthmus. I understand he's back. Got in last week. Sounds more like an adventurer than an engineer. He's an engineer, all right. Don't worry about that. But he's also, shall we say, independent. - Henry? - Yes, sir? - Jeff Kincaid's in town. - Yes, sir. - Find him. - Ye... Where shall I look for him, sir? - Well, you know him, don't you? - Yes, sir. Well, then you know where to look. Yes, sir. Mr. Kincaid? Excuse me. Mr. Kincaid! Mr. Kincaid. Mr. Kincaid. Mr. Kincaid. I'm glad I found you. I've been looking all over town for you. I have a very important message. That'll teach you to say I'm no lady! Mr. Kincaid. Kincaid. Hey, you can go now. Just when I was getting comfortable. - Hello, daley. - Hello, Jeff. - Did you bail me out? - Mr. Crocker. Nice of you. What happened to you? You did. Sorry, son. Let's go. Mr. Crocker wants to see you. How much did it cost to bail me out? - $20. - Got enough for one more? Sure, but Mr. Crocker told me to be sure... This is for that blonde lady down at the end, Compliments of Mr. Charles Crocker. I found him. Here he is. Hello, Jeff. How do you feel? Proud as I look. Thanks for bailing me out. - You broke? - Flat. Good. He's your man. This is William Sharon. He wants you to build him a railroad. The fact is I may not be ready to start. Don't be a fool. When I recommend a man for a tough job, I know what I'm talking about. Thanks, Mr. Crocker, but I don't want it. - You don't know what it is. - You said it was tough. - All I have to know to say no. - You've changed. Sure. Ever spend six months Pushing a track through a swamp With mosquitoes as big as your fist? Let me know whenever you need a good office man. Thanks. Daley was right. It wouldn't work anyway. Too many mountains to go around between Carson and Virginia. Why do you want to build a railroad in that desolate place? - That's my business. - What's your route? That's the trouble. There isn't any. All you have is a whole range of granite mountains. There's the big one, right there. - How do you know that country? - I was born there. You never told me that. You never asked me. I haven't been back in 10 years, But I remember that baby sticking up all by itself. That was my first engineering job. My kid brother and I swiped a couple of pickaxes and started To tunnel through it. Broke the handles before we got 2 feet in And got a licking to boot. Always said I'd come back someday and finish the job. - How does it look? - Just as dead as when I left. - You had a brother here? - Half brother. You can look him up and meet me later. Haven't seen him for 10 years. I can wait till I get a shave. As head of the family I've got to make a good impression. How do you spell "inconsequential"? How do you spell "inconsequential"? Look it up for yourself so you'll remember it. You're not fooling me. You don't know yourself. I wish dad would use shorter words in his editorials, Or else learn how to spell the long ones. That's the beauty of owning your own paper. Nobody can edit my copy. You're not supposed to hear that. I... N... Hmm. Alan! Look, it's Jeff! Jeff! Jeff! Jeff! Oh, I'm terribly sorry. I didn't mean to. I just got so excited. That's all right. I'm afraid I don't... Susan Mitchell. Don't you remember me? No. Why, I can't believe it. What do you expect me to do, stay 13 all my life? Hello, Jeff. - Alan. - Welcome home. Say, you filled out. Well, people change in 10 years. You haven't. I knew you right away. I had such a crush on you. I was always trying to impress you. Give me your coat. I'll get the stain off. There's plenty of time. I'm going to be around for a while. Wonderful. Will you have dinner with us tonight? Soon as I get cleaned up. See you later. So you've still got a crush on him. Don't be silly. That was kid stuff. Good. That was quite a reception. That was my brother and a girl I used to know. Used to? She was 13 when I left. Wore pigtails down to here. She doesn't anymore. MINE OWNERS MEETING ROOM 204 I'm not asking anybody to put up any money. I just wanted you to know what was going on. In other words, you hope we like it, Whether we like it or not. Is that it? - Not exactly, Zeke. - That's what it sounds like. In the first place it doesn't affect you. You wanted to get the story firsthand for your paper. Anything that happens to this town, that's my business. Afraid you're all ahead of me. - Hello, Davis. - Hello, big guy. Sorry I'm late. Got held up at the mine. What's this all about? I'm going to put in a railroad to Virginia city. I was just telling him I'm against it. I'm tired of these so-called champagne bandits. I want my gold to go through, I'm going to see that it does. Perhaps if you increased the reward money. I personally offered to put up $5,000. That didn't do it. This is the only solution. I'm surprised you aren't in favor of it. - It'll bring in more people. - What kind of people? Roughnecks, thugs, claim jumpers. That doesn't necessarily follow. We have a peaceful town. Should be kept that way. Open it up, and you'll have another dodge city, Where a decent woman can't step outdoors after sundown. Is that what you want for your families? That's a pretty one-sided picture. What happens to my stagecoach lines? We can't stop the clock, Henry. The railroad is faster and safer. My bank has an investment to protect. I have a contract with Henry dodson. I intend to honor it, railroad or no railroad. And my paper's going to fight against it. I think you're making a mistake. - We'll see. - I'm with you. Afraid I'll have to stay with my friends. I'm sorry, gentlemen. Now if the rest of you will stay, I'll go into more detail. Thanks, John. I won't forget this. What are friends for? Sharon's not in San Francisco now. He'll find out I swing some weight here, too. - Thanks, Zeke. - Anything I can do, Zeke? Read the paper tomorrow. If that deal goes through, we'll be out of business. - It won't. - What are you going to do? Never fight your own battles when you get somebody else to. Only thing that's going to stop Sharon's a. 45. He's got a long way to go. Must be a fascinating life... New places, new people. Always something different around the corner. You make it sound a lot better than it seems at the time. You must enjoy it, or you wouldn't do it. Maybe he just hasn't found anything better. I guess that's about it. Well, I must be going. Dad will be sorry he missed you. Give him my best. I'm sorry, Jeff. Didn't come out very well. Oh, forget it. It'll get a lot dirtier before I'm through. - Mr. Mitchell. - Jeff. - Glad to see you. - Wish I could say the same. - Dad? - Nothing personal. I just don't like what you're here for. What's wrong with it? Lots of things. Susan, will you take this downstairs and set it up? "Proposed railroad threat to Carson city. " Why is it a threat? This will be a different town if you put a railroad in here. It could stand a little waking up. I like the way it is. Growing pains are always a little tough, But you can't get to be an adult without them. Depends what you mean by being an adult. I don't judge a man just by his size. You got a good point there, Mr. Mitchell. Good night, sir. Thanks for dinner. Don't sound so formal. I've got to get used to you being grown-up. Wait a minute. I'll walk down with you. Good night, Susan. Good night, Mr. Mitchell. Good night, Alan. I don't think that was a very nice way to greet him. We're on different sides of the fence, that's all. - He understands. - Well, I don't. Look, it's late. You better hurry up with that copy. So you're a newspaper man now. Yeah. Not much by your standards, but I like it. That's what they pay off on. I thought it might be hard for you to understand how a man Could be satisfied to stay in one place. You wanted to see what was on the other side of the Mountain. Both sides are pretty much alike. The way I figure it, You got everything you want right here. Not much sense looking anywhere else. Of course, it doesn't make a man out To be a very dashing figure. You're on the right track, kid. Stay on it. - I intent to. - Remember, I'm on your side. Come on in. I'll buy you a drink. No, thanks. Glad to have you back, Jeff. Goodnight. Good night. Maybe you can go with dodson, but I can't. If the railroad guarantees delivery at cheaper rates, I have to go along. - Beer. - Right. REWARD 7,500 $ FOR THE CAPTURE ALIVE OR DEAD OF THE BANDITS CHAMPAGNE "Champagne bandits. " Pretty fancy title for a bunch of holdup men. From what I hear, they're a pretty fancy bunch. You the fellow that came to town with Sharon? Yes. My name's Davis. At our mine owners meeting just now, Sharon's been telling us about this railroad idea. Glad to know you. I'm Jeff Kincaid. This is Dave Fairchild, Ben Roberts, and Jim squires. I understand you're the engineer. That's right. You really think you can put it through? I don't see anything that can stop us. What about the terrain? It's pretty rugged country. That's what makes it interesting. Are you against it, too? Might say for ethical reasons. I have a contract with the stagecoach line. The owner's a friend. Nothing in the book against my buying A drink for the opposition, though. Thanks, but Sharon's waiting for me. We've some work to do. Don't you go tell him I tried to bribe you. No, but I'll keep it in mind. Goodnight, gentlemen. Nice fellow. We better be going. It would make it easier for me if you learned how to smile. You do the smiling. Being nice to guys like this is your idea. Only this time, it ain't going to work. You never believe my way will work, but it always does. We've never run up against guys like this before. We'll still play it my way first. "A RAIL PROPOSAL IS THREATENING CARSON CITY ". "Plans revealed at a meeting." "WORKS OF RAILWAY BEGINS IN SPITE OF PUBLIC OPINION ". Set off number two. I've seen hard rock in my day, but never anything like this. Wait till we get those automatic drills. Look! Go back! Go back! It's a woman! Get back! Get back! Yah! Back! What? Well! If I'm not being too curious... Are you all right? I guess so. I just didn't expect so violent a greeting. We do things big out here. I've really got the touch, haven't I? First time I see you, I ruin your jacket, And then a whole Mountain blows up on me. - What's the matter? - My ankle. Our horses are halfway back to town. All right, put your arm around my shoulder. What were you doing out here? Looking for news. You nearly made some. I might as well confess. I didn't come out here looking for a story. I came to find out why you've been avoiding me. Got the feeling your father didn't exactly Have the welcome mat out for me. I'm not talking about my father. I've been pretty busy. You don't work at night. I thought your evenings would be taken up. With Alan? We're good friends. We've grown up together... Do all your good friends kiss you good night? Why, that was just a peck on the cheek, like this. You don't call that a real kiss, do you? - Or do you? - I stumbled. Ah, here comes the wagon. - Next time I come... - There won't be any next time. Why? Just who are you protecting with all this? Alan and me, or yourself? Let's say everybody. If that fuse would have been a half-inch shorter, You two would have been covering a lot of territory now. This is hardrock haggerty, my foreman. - Glad to meet you. - Howdy, ma'am. I'll drive her home. You're a mighty lucky girl, ma'am. That's a matter of opinion. Giddyap! - Think you can walk on it? - It's all right now. But you better see the doctor anyway. It's already been treated. Giddyap! Go. Hello, Kincaid. Whoa. I hear about you putting a tunnel through the Mountain? We aren't going to have the privilege of being turned Into a bustling Metropolis for several years, then. Sorry to disappoint you, but it'll only take a few months. We're going to use automatic drills. Automatic drills? Yeah, something new. Work by compressed air. They'll be here in a few days. Come out next week and take a look. Well, I guess that does it, But I've started over before. I guess I ain't too old to start someplace else. Looks as if your newspaper Hadn't quite the influence we thought it had. As long as I've got ink to print it, I'm going to keep on trying. You can't fight an automatic drill With a printing press, Zeke. I'm afraid that's right. All right, let's go. Whoa. - All right, get down. - Whoa. Get down. I ain't hauling any gold or silver. Nothing back there but machinery. Never mind about that. Get down. Sure, I'll get down. Squires! All right, get him back in the wagon. Pick him up. Throw him up in there. Hurry up. Get out of the way. All right, get them out of here! Head them down that hill and cut them loose! Yah! All right, fellas. Come on, push! Come this way. All right, push! Let's go. It's got to be someplace. A whole wagonload of drills just can't disappear. Kingpin. Busted? Yeah. Too big a load. That kingpin must have busted. It's a good thing these things were built rugged. We'll be able to salvage the most of them. Jeff! Here he is. Looks like he was trying to crawl. And trying to write something, too. "S-o-u... " "S-o-u"... South? Well, whatever it is, we ain't going to find out now. "Sharing the attitude of your editor is a. J. Davis, "One of Carson city's most prominent "And respected citizens, and partner with Jim squires"... I don't think he's such a good ad for your side. You don't agree with me, do you? As you're so fond of saying, quote, "I disapprove" "Of what you say, but I'll defend to the death Your right to say it," unquote. - Here, I'll set it up. - No, you go on to bed. I want to check over this article about the accident. Oh, the freight wagon? They never figured out what the driver was trying to write? No. I guess it will always be a mystery. Good night, dad. Good night, dear. Don't stay up too late. S-o... What could it be? What could it be? Well. "Sharing the attitude of your editor, comma", "Is a. J.

I heard there was a shindig going on in town. You're staying here. Say, what are you so worried about? You. I told you that driver recognized me. Look, what else was I to do, Let him go and spread the word in town? Besides, everybody thinks it was an accident. Let's keep it that way. What else is there to do out here? Besides, I don't notice you Spending any more time out here than you have to. You're the miner, I'm not. All right, you, get up there. I'll take it. Hello, Zeke. Hello, a. J. He said he wanted to see you. That's all right. He's a friend of mine. Come in. We'll finish going over those balance sheets later on. All right. See you later. Well, I, uh, I didn't want to interrupt If... if you were talking business. Forget it. Sit down. Sorry you got such a tough reception Out there, Zeke, But with all this banditry going on, We got to be careful. Cigar? Thanks. What's on your mind? Well, I-i heard something in town That I thought you ought to know about. You remember those letters That the freight wagon driver wrote... s-o-u? Well, somebody got to fiddling around With a pencil, and he figured That, uh, if the "o" was a capital "q," It might be the beginning of squires' name. That sounds pretty far-fetched. Yeah, that's what I told the folks, But you know how people are. I thought I'd tip you off, just in case. I appreciate it, Zeke. Still, if somebody Really wanted to make something out of it, Jim squires was working here at the mine all that day. Oh, well, fine. Well, I guess I better be getting on, then. What's your hurry? Well, it's... It's getting late, And I'm not as young as I once was, you know. Good night. I thought you didn't go in for gunplay. Wake up. Dad, wake up. It's morning. It's morning. Wake up. Dad... Dad! Ohh! Uncle Henry. I heard about your father. I'm sorry I couldn't get back from Reno In time for the funeral. - Any new developments? - Not a thing. - Sure does beat all. - What are you hauling? Rail sections. Somebody's got to haul their freight for them. I figured I might as well get all I can Before they put me out of business. I'll be over and see you just as soon as I get this delivered. How about a drink before we get back? Wait a minute. Susan... I've been wanting to talk to you. Haven't you done enough? I hear there's talk around town Blaming the railroad for what happened. Does that surprise you? I've checked up on all my men. They've all accounted for where they were that night. Naturally. They wouldn't lie to you. Alan, please take me back home. You don't really believe we had anything to do with it? My father didn't have an enemy in the world until this started, But he fought the railroad, and he was killed. - What else should I think? - That answers your question? Come on. Now I think I'll have that drink. That's more like it. Mitchell didn't say what was on his mind When he came here looking for me? Just asked if you'd been around. Wish he'd found me. Maybe this wouldn't have happened. Nobody in this town had anything against him. It was that railroad crowd. They wanted to shut him up. I think we ought to run them out. You can't just take the law Into your own hands without proof. What do you want to do, Wait till they kill somebody else? I think we've waited long enough. Speak of the devil. Afternoon, gentlemen. Two whiskeys. Wait a minute, Joel. Railroad money's no good in here. New rule? We put it in when Mitchell got killed. Are you going to bring that bottle, Or do I have to get it? I got a right to refuse service. Let it go, hardrock. Come on, we're leaving. If you know what's good for you, You'll keep right on going. I'm trying to keep the lid on. Don't force your luck. I'm not asking you. I'm telling you! Now get on out of town before I... Don't do that unless you can back it up. And get this, all of you... Any time you've got evidence that a railroad man Had anything to do with Mitchell's killing, I'll be the first to bring him in. Until then, I'll keep out of your way, and you'll keep out of mine. Watch it. What's the matter, afraid of getting dirty? How'd you like to have a nice cold glass of beer? I forgot what it tastes like. I'm going to town. I'm going to town! Anybody coming with me? Beer. Nope, I'm not supposed to... Bring us some beer. Yeah, sure. And set up a bottle of whiskey with them. Hey, you, have a drink. No, thanks. I offered to buy you a drink. We don't want a drink. Why don't you go back where you belong? I like it here better. Any objections? Come on, jeb. Have a beer! Next time somebody offers to buy you a drink... All right, boys, party's over. The party's not over for you. Let's get back to camp. We signed on here to build a railroad. What we do after working hours is our own business. I made a deal with the town. I intend to keep it. We'll be back to work tomorrow, not before. All right, then, We'll do it the hard way. Everybody, back to camp. Give him a hand. Send me the bill. "Railroad workers terrorize town. "Saloon wrecked in brawl. "Once again, Carson city has cause "To regret the presence of the railroad. "As predicted by the late owner of this paper, It has brought with it nothing but trouble. " Don't you think you're being a little unfair? I wouldn't have written it if I did. Jeff was only trying to stop it. You know that. Susan... Yes? I think it's about time we got something settled. We made an agreement that you were to run the paper. I just... I'm not talking about that. I'm talking about you and me. I know I've never said anything about it before, But, well, I just figured Someday maybe you and I would... Well... Alan, don't. Oh, I know this isn't the time or place to ask you, but... It isn't that. It's just that... Well, I've never thought of you that way. We've grown up together. You've always seemed more like a... Brother? I'm sorry, Alan. I don't mean to hurt you. I thought you always felt the same way about me. - I had no idea. - Well, never mind. We've always been honest with each other. You wouldn't want me any other way, would you? Why don't you be honest? Why don't you tell the truth? Didn't feel this way before Jeff came back. That has nothing to do with it. You fell all over yourself when he came into town. I wish I'd never laid eyes on him. That doesn't mean I would have married you. I don't believe it. Everybody in town knew you were my girl. I think you've said just about enough. Am I also fired from my job? That's up to you. I need you here, But you don't have to stay if you don't want to. Where can I find Jeff Kincaid? That tent over there. Hello, Alan. Glad to see you. Sit down. I didn't come here to visit. Read that. It just came out. Why show it to me? I just wanted you to know where I stand. I've been getting an idea of where you stood For some time now. It hasn't seemed to bother you any. I'm getting paid to do a job. If that's the way you see it, well, that's your job. Isn't it a little late to be so tolerant? You're talking about Mitchell, I don't know more than you do. I made that clear last time I saw you. Yeah. It doesn't go over any better with Susan. Let's leave her out of it, shall we? You've been trying to undermine me Ever since you got here. I'm not doing but get a railroad built. You're a liar. If you weren't my brother, I'd call you on that. Only a half brother, but don't let that stop you. I don't know what happened between you and Susan, But I didn't have anything to do with it. Not much. The big engineer... Big talk about Panama, San Francisco. I'm just the guy that's been here all along. I have enough trouble without having to wipe your nose. If you're such a good man, grow up and act like one. All right, I'll start now. Come on. What are you waiting for? Get out. Hello, Kincaid. Just a minute. That's got it. Hello, Mr. Sharon. I was going to send you a wire tonight. We ought to be punching through here. That's not all you've been punching lately. Davis sent this to me. There's enough bad feeling against us in town already Without something like this happening. Don't believe everything. It wasn't that bad. I got you out of jail to do this job. One more episode like this, you'll end up back there. It would be a relief. You seem to think there's something amusing About being involved in a barroom brawl. Better check the tunnels. We're getting too much seepage. Check the other one. See if they've got it, too. Other one? What other one? We're tunneling in from both sides. Look. Here we are. Here's the other one coming in along the same axis. How do you know they'll meet? Is that standard engineering practice? Will be someday. My bank isn't interested in financing experiments. Let's understand each other, Mr. Sharon. You hired me to build this railroad. I either do it my way, or get another engineer. I don't seem to have very much choice now. That's what I figured. I want to see this other tunnel. Hardrock, show Mr. Sharon the other tunnel. All right, Jeff. There's a new one started over there. It's coming in back here. It started a couple of hours ago. We've tapped underground water. Get some pumps. Is it all right to keep on drilling? Let's shore it up first. Give me a hand. Isn't that seepage dangerous? No more than the rest of the job. I must say... Come back! No! Let's get help. Come on, get out of there! - We're trapped. - Shut up. If the roof holds, we'll be all right. And if it doesn't, There's nothing we can do about it anyway. There's been a landslide at tunnel number one! Kincaid and his crew are trapped! The landslide covered the entrance! You've got to go in after them through tunnel number one. It would take too long to get through that landslide. We'll work through tunnel number two. Let's get going! Ride into town. Get all the help you can get. Come on! Let's go! Folks! Landslide! There's been a landslide at the tunnel! Kincaid and some of the men are trapped! We need all the help we can get! George, what happened? Landslide blocked the tunnel. They need help. Was anybody inside? Kincaid and some of the others. They're trying to dig them out. Landslide down at the tunnel! Alan! - Alan, did you hear that? - Yeah, I heard it. Well, aren't you going out to help? No. Compressor must have been broken. This thing won't do us any good. Let's get it out of the way. The air in here will last a couple of days. We got plenty of water. Start working here to meet haggerty. How do you know he's coming through this way? Suppose he tries to come in from the outside. If he does, I'll fire him. Conserve the oil in the lamp. Don't move around any more than you have to. Come on, we're wasting time. I want 150 pounds of pressure. Tie that safety valve down. - What can we do? - Grab shovels and get inside. If it were me, I'd still try to reach him from the other side. I ain't you. Give me that drill! Can I help? He can use all the help we can get. Tell me the truth. Is there a chance? Sure, there's a chance. There's always a chance. Hear anything? No. I'll be all right. Too soon. Maybe there ain't anything to hear. Keep digging. If you ask me... I didn't. - Take a break, ed. - Thanks. I got to get back to work. All right, next shift. What do you think? I think I'd like a big, fat, juicy steak. Coffee? Thanks. Been up all night. Why don't you get some sleep? I'm all right. I'll get you some food. I think I hear something. I thought... And it's only the water. Ha ha ha. Let's go. Back to work. Come on. How's it going? If Kincaid's figures are right, we should be pretty close. You realize, don't you, that if this shaft Is one-half a degree out of line, you'll go right on by? That's right. She ain't going to take much more. You've got one job. Just keep them drills going. Everybody, lie down and don't move except when you have to. We better save what oxygen we got left. I always knew I'd get it someday, But not like this in a rotten, lousy, stinking place. Listen. Listen. They made it! We're out! You've been at it a long time. Get a breather. I'll take over. I'm all right. Hey, we broke through! Hey, we're through! We made it! Hold it. We made it. We broke through. Everybody all right? Doobie, you're beautiful. Get hogan. Good work, hardrock. Jeff. Well, looks like you've joined the crew. A general misconception banker's good to count his money. - Not anymore there isn't. - Jeff, I'm so glad. Hardrock, anybody hurt outside? Three hurt, two dead. Wilson and hildebrand were caught in a landslide. - Where did it start? - About halfway up. We've been too busy down here to check on it. - Check on it now. - Now? See you later. Sometimes I think engineers are crazy. Look at that. It was solid rock. Otherwise, I wouldn't have started the tunnel over there. What have you got on your mind? That's what I came up here to find out. This is about where it started. There it is. Drill hole. Powder burns. Maybe that freight wagon was no accident, either. You got any idea who did it? No, but until I find out, they are not going to get chances. Whoa. - Have any trouble on the way? - All clear. Get them out to the assembly camp. The mechanics are waiting to put them together. Okay. Yah! One more trip, and all those extra wagons Will be paid for. THE RAILROAD NEARS COMPLETION. Construction Ahead of Schedule. - Give me two. - Stop the game, boys. I'm tired of playing for matches anyway. When are we going to get paid? Next week, when the railroad's finished. What are we going to do, buy stock in it? I've been talking to some of the mine owners. They've been holding the bullion back Till they can ship it by rail. There'll be more gold on that train Than a dozen stagecoaches could carry. It'll be the biggest haul we've ever made. We can't go around holding up trains. We can get away with it once. That's all we need. This is the big one. Everybody in town will be on that train. There'll be guards... Leave that to me. We'll split into four groups. You and Steve will go with me. Frosty, you and Evans will work together. Bert, you'll be in charge of the main party. Clem, you'll catch up with us later Up at stony pass with the supplies. - Why pick me for that? - That's what I worked it out. Biting off a pretty big chew. You've been squawking about getting out of here. Well, you can do it now. One more job, and we're set for life. No more rotten food, Crummy rooms, stupid people. I can live like a gentleman should. I'll travel to Paris, Rome, anywhere I want to go. Yeah, if it works. It will. To the railroad. TRAIN TO MAKE INITIAL RUN TODAY. Leading citizens from both towns invited. People certainly have short memories. A while back, they wouldn't let a railroad man in town. Hello, Susan. I'm glad you're here. It's my job. In case it slipped your mind, her father Used to run the newspaper before he was murdered. I haven't forgotten that for one moment. Well, it's your big day. Don't let us keep you from your friends. I've taken a lot from you. Don't press your luck. Ain't you going along? I just build them. This is for sightseers. Everybody I invited showed up except Davis. He's a hard loser. All aboard! See you later! Let me know where you're going to build the next one. I got to keep those new wagons busy. I wonder why Davis is still holding out. Who knows why Davis does anything? I thought the only reason he was against us Was loyalty to you when he thought the railroad Put you out of business. If I had depended on him, I'd have gone broke. What happened between you and him? Nothing. That's just it. All that talk he made about always shipping with me, Railroad or no railroad, was just talk. I haven't seen one ounce of his bullion Since you came here. He used to be my best customer, too. All through the holdups and all that, He never missed a shipment any time. And then you came along, and he's stockpiling Waiting for you fellows to finish so he can ship with you. He isn't shipping with us. He must have some other reason for fighting with you fellows. That's what I'm thinking. - Hey, w-what about our drink? - Later. Drop that gun. - Come on, get down. - This is private property. You got no right busting in here. Where's Davis? I don't know. Where are you going with these supplies? It's none of your business. Talk pretty tough for a man with a price on his head. There's a reward for you champagne bandits. You can't tie me in with them. I'm doing my job. So were a lot of people when they got killed... Freight wagon driver, two of my men In the landslide, and Mitchell. I had nothing to do with that. I get paid for guarding this mine. This mine's phony, and you know it. Go ahead. - Where to? - You'll find out. What did we come up here for? That's my crew. Ask you questions about my men getting killed in the landslide. Get going. Come on, Robbie. Quicker we break camp and get it loaded, The sooner we get home. You don't have to say that twice. Take it. You got a visitor, boys. Thought you'd like to meet one of the men Responsible for the landslide. I thought he was one of Jack Davis' miners. They've got a sideline... Robbing stagecoaches and a few murders. What are you trying to do? Come here, you. We'll give him a fair trial, won't we, boys? Sure. We'll hang him legal After we're through with him. Let me have a crack at him. I didn't kill anybody. It's Davis you want. I told you, it's Davis you want. Maybe so, but you're the only one we got. - He's on the train. - You're lying. I just came from Carson city. He wasn't on the train. He's getting on in Virginia city. They're going to hold it up on the way back. Where? Beyond the big cut. All the men are there. I was meeting 'em afterwards. Men, now's your chance to get even with all of them. Hey, give me that gun and holster. See that he stays here. "VIRGINIA CITY WELCOMES THE RAILROAD " That's the biggest shipment of bullion Ever went out of Virginia city. I'll be glad when it's in the bank. I've got guards in there and two more up in the engine cab. Well, I guess that does it. All right, let's go. Gentlemen, after you. We have to treat the customers right. You two stay here on this platform. This is the richest sofa I ever sat on. It sure is. - Well, this is wonderful. - Certainly is. Enjoy yourselves, gentlemen. Good morning. Good morning, Susan, Alan. Davis, too. I never thought I'd see him on this train. Glad you changed your mind, Davis. I happened to be in Virginia city, So I thought I'd take advantage of your kind invitation. How do you like it? I must say it has certain advantages. I knew you'd come around. Here. Help yourself to champagne. It's a little trick I learned from the outlaws. Had some good ideas at that. Ha ha ha. A lovely trip. This is wonderful, isn't it? Yes, indeed. I didn't see any of your golden elephant shipments up there. I thought I'd look it over first. This is quicker, cheaper, and safer. - What more do you want? - Maybe you're right. If I were you, I'd get that champagne before it's gone. He's probably putting it on our freight bill anyway. That's right. Susan, is everything all right? Yes, thank you. He can be very jovial now that he's won, But I'm surprised at you joining in. It doesn't do any good to stay bitter. It doesn't change things, like dad or anything else. What do you mean? There was no need to behave the way you did Towards Jeff when we got on the train. For a girl who wished she never saw him again, You do a lot of sticking up for him. You're in love with him, and you know it. - Mind keeping your voice down? - I don't care who hears me. Well, I do. - What are you doing? - Get back in there! Stop! Stop! Get back! You little fool! Keep her moving! I'll tell you when to stop! Pile the wood by the door. Hey, what about them? We'll leave them. They can't do any harm. That ain't the way you felt about Mitchell. Shut up. Open the door. Hurry up and get this stuff out of here. Kincaid's men! Let's get out of here! Where do you think you're going? Don't be a fool. There's enough here for both of us. Wait a minute. This horse has gone lame. What are you doing? He can't carry me and the gold both. That's right. There's a pass a mile or so from here. Jeff, look out! They make it awful tough for a fellow To try to apologize to his brother. And it's time you live up to your end of the bargain And put in the road from Carson city to Reno! You'll break this lamp yet, will. I'll have to, to get some action around here. I'm just as anxious as you are. When we get this section built, we'll have a direct line From Virginia city to San Francisco. I haven't been able to locate... Come in. I found him... I mean them. I know why you sent for me, and it's no use. We just stopped in to say goodbye... Who does he think's putting in track between Carson and Reno? Not me. I promised Susan a real honeymoon. We're going to have one. If you have an opening For a good office man, that's something else. Not now. I wanted to give you first crack At finishing this job, but I guess anybody can handle it. As you said, there's nothing to it. We'll just follow the natural bend of the wash. Do it right. Here's your best drainage. It may take a little long... Oh, no, Not this time. The train leaves in 25 minutes. We're not going to be on it, are we, honey? Of course not, dear.
