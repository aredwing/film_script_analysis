I ain't going to tell you again now. Get out here! Look dad, you go out, go on without me. I'm going to sleep a while longer. I want you to get dressed, and get out here on the double! Hubba! Hubba! We got a full day ahead of us. I been up for an hour already! So you been up for an hour already. Hubba. Hubba. Hey! This water smells funny. It tastes funny too. It's probably bad water. The water's good. Something wrong with you. It's just fresh, no chemicals. Now, will you get the lead out? Well you never know. I mean, the way industrial waste gets thrown around these days. There's probably some big industry up there that's just dumping in this river and polluting the hell out of it. You looking for something? Garbage. Trash. Dad, why does it always have to be like this? Like what son? You and me. I mean we can never agree on anything. We can never be on the same side. Load it. Well boy, there's not a feeling to beat this in the whole world, nothing in the whole bloody world. Look, the sun's almost up all the way now. Don't you think we've missed all the animals? I swear you got that pessimism from your mother. You didn't get it from me. If you'd lived with me all those years you'd be a man now instead of a sissy. Being a man doesn't mean I have to come out here with a big gun and shoot little animals that aren't even a threat to me. I missed the son of a bitch. What's the matter son? Scare you? Now, what was it you were saying to me about being a man? Forget it. Probably wouldn't understand. Well there's good hunting left. I'm going to get me some game today, one way or the other, I'm going to shoot me something. Help! Help! Help! Help me son! Should be fun at the lake today, huh? Yeah. You'll like Greg. Well, what do you know about him? He's a friend of Tom's, that's all. Look at, Tom would not set you up with a geek, you know? This is money in the bank. I'm serious. - You think so? Huh? - I'm not kidding. You'll see. That's cool Beth, take your time. That's good. I mean that's cool. Hi, Tom. How you doing? Hi, Tom. Would you say hello to her please? Hello. Hello. Look, you'll be safe with Greg. I personally guarantee it. Okay? Let's go. Off to the mountains. Huh, it looks like it's closed. Do you believe this? Typical. I've got to go to the ladies room. I'll go with you. Yeah, all right. Go ahead. I'll get the gas. What is that? Somebody shot a bobcat. Gosh, that's horrible. It's all right. It's dead now. Go ahead. There it is. Great. Terrific. It's locked. Why don't you try the men's room? Great. The story of my life, you know. Sandy, don't start laughing. Cause if you start laughing, then I'm in trouble. I'm not laughing. Sandy! What the hell are you doing in here? This is the men's latrine. Well my girlfriend, she needed it, and the women's room was... What's that mean? Huh? No chance, no help, no escape. I can't figure kids out today. Where the hell is everyone? Amazing. Maybe that doesn't matter. These old pumps don't lock. Crank that up for me will you? So, what do you think of Sandy? Seems like a very nice girl. So where are they? Women, in the bathroom, right? Here they are now. Are you ready? Yeah, well we had to use the men's room. You know, you guys write really weird things on bathroom walls. What are you talking about? Somebody wrote no chance, no help, no escape. Yeah, and there was a strange man in there too. - Is he still in there? - No. Let's get out of here, we don't have to pay for the gas. What do you mean? Wait a minute. Come on. Let's pay for the gas. Hey come on, Tom. Huh? I mean, it's not like it's a big oil company or something. - Let's pay them. - Well, I'm paying. - Hello? - Hello? Anybody home? What is this? Let's get out of here, you guys. This place really gives me the creeps. Hey, wait a second. Baby rats. Sandy look at... Oh, gosh, isn't it cute? I think we better get out of here. What the hell are you kids doing in here? We were looking for you. We were going to pay for the gas we took outside. We took $10, here's $20. $12.80. Ain't seen you kids before. What are you doing around here? We were just going to the lake. Oh, I'd stay away from there if I was you. How come? Well, it's hunting season. There's been more than one accident over there with strangers in these parts. I guess we might get mistaken for some deer or something. Look, I'm telling you. Don't go down to the lake. Did you shoot all these animals? Yeah, that's right. Every one of them. Why? You've never been hunting have you? No, and I don't plan to either. Oh, it's a good sport, as long as you follow the rules. Yeah, well I don't see it as a sport. I don't think I could ever kill an animal. Well it depends on the animal and who's doing the hunting. Besides, I never kill for the sport. I eat what I kill, and the sport is in the tracking and the hunting, not in the kill. Yeah, well that's wonderful, but, I think we should really be going. Yeah, yeah let's go. Come on, come on. Let's go. I'm telling you kids not to go down to the lake, please. It's full of hunters this time of year now. I'm warning you. Okay. Okay, we won't go to the lake. We won't go. All right. That guy has a real cheerful outlook. Mine eyes have seen the glory of the coming of the Lord. 72 bottles of beer on the wall All right men, halt. Check rations and ammo. We're going to camp here for a while. Now, I want to talk with you men. All my life I have wanted to lead a troop of men like you into the wilderness. Today is the day. I am leading you into the wilderness. Now, these are hallowed mountains. A great Indian tribe called the Guapo lived, hunted, roamed in these tribes. They weren't like the Apache or the Iroquois or the Chippewa. Did they kill Custer? No. No. The Guapo were famous for raising beans. They were a bean raising tribe. But being a scout, one is never lost, because we have our compass and we... You can see, see by the... Now this stream, this goes downstream, and all streams empty into a lake, and the lake empties into the ocean. Doesn't it? Of course it does. Now, boys, men, without leaving this trail, I want you to pick up a rock or a branch, and bring it home to mom and dad as a memento of our trip. No rattlesnakes though, because rattlesnakes carry germs. All right men. Dismissed. Hey! Anybody home? Anybody home? Hello there! Anybody home? I could use some help. Anybody in there? I've got some cub scouts down the way and... And my blisters are killing me. Hello? Anybody out there? Anybody there? Come on now. Huh? Huh? Huh? Sensational. Sensational. The man says only sensational. - All right, it's great. - Great. Hey, you don't think the guy at the station was right? I mean some crazy hunter's going to... I'm sure we're safe, Sandy. We're just going to have some fun. It will be all right. Last one in gets stuffed and mounted. Well, ready? All right. Come on Sandy, it's great! All right! Want to go for a walk? You know when I was a kid, I could have fixed this thing very easily. I used to have a ham radio set, and I used to sit up all night long and listen for distress signals. - Yeah? - Yeah. Well did you ever hear any? Yeah, yeah one time I even sent an ambulance to an accident and got my picture in the paper. Yeah? Why are you putting your shirt on? You want me to take it off? Come here. You know, it's the silliest thing. This thing was working so well yesterday. I don't like that sound. It makes me feel lost and far away from home. It must be coming from a long ways away huh? Yeah. Well, you think they're through at the lake? Yeah. - Should we get back? - Yeah. Okay. Tom? Beth? I wonder where they are? Well, if I know Tom, they're in the back of the van. Tom, hello? We're back. Beth? Hey guys we're back. Hey. We're back. Hello? They're not there. Maybe they went for a walk. I'm getting kind of cold. How about you? Yeah, yeah. I'm hungry. Well, there's food in the van. All right. Let's get some. Where the hell are those guys? How could they do this? I mean they've been gone over an hour. They've got to know we're going to be worried about them, don't they? Yeah, well I'm worried. I mean this is stupid. I hate it when people do things like this. It drives me crazy. Well, what do you want to do? Well, look for them I guess. Let's try this path here. I'm right behind you. It goes through here. Okay. Watch your step. Through here I think. They wouldn't have gone through here, would they? Yeah, they did. Look, you can see. Now come on. Sandy! Sandy! Are you all right? Yeah, I'm okay. Give me your hand. Nice and easy. Okay. Okay. Okay. - You all right? - Yeah. I'm okay. We got to get out of here. Tom and Beth could be in one of these. - Okay, come on. - Wait, what's that? I don't know. Come on, let's check it out. Easy, easy. What do you think? I don't know. Water department. Keys? Keys! Where are the keys? It's eating through the windshield. What's that sound? Something's trying to get in through the side door. Hey here are the keys. Greg, do something. Get out of here! All right. All right. Come on start! All right. All right. What is that? I don't know. I don't know. Try the windshield wipers. Okay. I'm... I'm going to find some help. I'm... Where are we? Some kind of country bar. I'm going to go inside and try and find somebody to help us. I'm going with you. No, no. You stay here. I don't know what's going on. I'm... I'm going to be right back. You lock the door. I'll be right back. You'll be safe. Hey, you ever find that long-lost wife of yours, Leo? No, but I didn't look very hard either. Hi, hi son! Come on in. Take any seat in the joint. Our friends are dead. Well what happened. They've been murdered. Well come on in. Sit down. Take it easy. Relax. Give the kid a beer Ivy. No, no. I need help. I need some help. My friends, my friends are dead. Please lady. Call the police. Now calm down, son. Calm down. You've got to tell us a little more before we call in the sheriff. Please lady come on. Call the police. All right. I will. Just start from the start. Tell me what happened and I'll call the police. It was some kind off lying creature. They hit our van. They were like... Hey Sarge, come here. Just a second fellows. I just taught this recruit another lesson. This round's on Bill. Yeah, what is it? Hey Sarge, this guy here a friend of yours? No, never seen him before. Well he says he's seen some of your flying saucers. Yeah. You seen them little critters? The flying critters. Yeah, yeah. They attacked our van. Feisty little things ain't they? Are you two guys in cahoots here, Sarge? Did you pay this guy to come in here and spread your crazy stories? Look, I'm warning you! When they start eating on you, don't come to me for help. Cause you ain't getting any. Come on Sarge. Lighten up. I told you they were going to attack. I said so. It's happening Aggie. I knew it was going to happen. I told you. We've got to prepare for invasion. Lady please. I'm telling you the truth. If you don't believe me, ask my girl in the van. What? There's a girl outside who's seen those critters? Yeah. Let's bring her in here. We're going to go out and get her. Then you'll believe me. Come on. Sandy, I've got help! Sandy! Sandy. She in there boy? Sandy! Where is she? I don't know. Sandy! They must have captured her. No soldier. Not at night. They've got the edge in the dark. They'll stalk you out and you won't see them until they bury themselves in your guts. - Look I'm just... - Don't give me any of your lip. I'm in command here. You do as you're told. Your job is to take orders. Leave him alone. Sarge, you are not in the Army no more. Don't let him scare you. He's never hurt nobody before. See, he's, he's suffered a lot, and, he gets carried away, forgets where he is. I'll call the police for you. Why don't you come on inside? I mean you can't look for your girlfriend out here in the dark by yourself anyway. So, come on. No chance. No help. No escape. The girl wasn't there. You sit here son, and I'll call the police. Hey Sarge. Huh? Everything all right out there? You know Dave, Dave you ought to be thanking me, but you're like every other damn fool in this country, always ready to retreat. That's why we haven't won a war in over 35 years. I mean you wouldn't see a warning if it was staring you right in the face. Makes perfect sense to me. They start out here in the country. They establish a foothold, and after they got us they move in on the cities. That way they've got a base to fight from. I'll be damned if they get me without a fight. They're not going to get Sergeant Fred Dobbs easy. Not this time. The Sheriff will be here in a little while. He's catching a pack of lost cub scouts from the city. Aggie, get me another beer, would you? Sure, Leo. Why don't you have another one, and another one. That way you can get good and drunk. You won't feel anything when they start eating you alive. You know Sarge, if I didn't know any better, I'd say you got out of the service on a section 8. I got an honorable discharge. Oh, sure, I had a little trouble with the yellow belly chicken brass, but I... I got out on an honorable discharge after 26 years of service. I think this belongs to you. Sandy. Sandy. She's going to be all right. I found her out there in the woods running like a scared rabbit. Greg, thank God. I saw it. It was horrible. You seen it? You seen the creature? Yeah, it was huge. That's how the bodies got in the shack. I'm going to get you kids something to eat. You need some food in your stomachs. Thank you. You guys never been in combat. You don't know. I'm telling you, the enemy is out there right now, killing people! You found the shack where it stores the bodies? Yeah. They're hanging on hooks. Like animals. Oh, damn. Not again. Don't worry, I'll light the lamps. This is the first step. Cut off the electricity. I've seen it before. Oh, Fred, knock it off will you? Attack in the dark. They'll have the advantage then. Fred, stop it. Right now. It's just the power company again. Yeah? That's just what they want you to believe. I know. Sarge, we've been having power outs for years. Yeah, there's nothing to be scared of. I may need your help, Joe, with Fred. What'd you say? What'd you say about me? I said the meat in the freezer is going to get thawed if the power don't get turned back on. Now stop being so jumpy. You're getting everybody all scared. Did you hear that? Yeah. I figured it would be just like this. Isolate us and then take us one at a time. Look, I know you don't believe me but I don't give a damn because I know what I'm saying is true, and you're too blind to see it. You think we're the only living creatures in this universe? You think with all those stars out there we're the only things that exist? Well, I got news for you. We ain't! We ain't alone! Supposing we ain't alone, supposing there's a whole bunch of aliens like you say, monsters, supposing there's a whole bunch of spaceships parked in the parking lot right over the hill. Supposing it's all true, like you say, then why in the hell ain't the CIA, the FBI and your own Army done something about it? Because they never do nothing about nothing. Tell me about the shack. You said the bodies were hanging. Can you find it again? Aliens ain't human you know. They could take human form. All right Fred. All right, I ain't listening to no more. All right, you don't believe me! So, I'm going to go out there and find... Hold it! You're scaring the women. Why don't you sit down? Sandy, what's the matter? I don't know. I feel something, a chill. No! Oh, my God. Oh, no, Ben. Oh, my God. Oh, no. Oh, Ben. He's still breathing. Call an ambulance. I didn't mean it. It was a mistake. I mean, something came over me. Something possessed me. I didn't... It's all your fault. It all started when you come in. Look mister, I don't know what you're talking about. Yeah, that's when it started, after you came in. All the lights and the noise. You've done enough for tonight Sarge. Give me the gun. You stay out of this. You don't know what's going on here. You don't know what's in control here. The gun. Get out of my way, Taylor. I'm the only one who knows what's going on here. I'm the only one. I'm the only one who can protect us. You kids get outside. Don't let them out of your sight. No! Keep him in here. Don't let them go Taylor. Taylor! Don't let them go. You'll regret this Taylor! Come on with me. We're heading back to town, to the nearest police station. Don't argue with me. Come on. Greg, I don't think we should go with him. It's okay. Now you ain't got a choice, young lady. Where's the shack? Like I said, it's back at the lake. Our two friends were hanging on the wall, with three others, three men. You're going to take me there. You're crazy. I don't want to go back there. Take it easy, Sandy. No, I don't want to go back there. We need the police. Now before we can convince the police that we ain't as crazy as Sarge, this thing is going to kill again. Now, get in the truck. He's right. Yeah, he's right. Come on. Come on, let's get him the hell out of here. He going to be all right? I don't know. We'll do our best. Better hope he ain't dead Sarge. No chance. No help. No escape. Dobbs! Fred! Sergeant First Class. Serial number RA18840644. You two stay here. Greg, please. I don't want to go back there. We don't know who this guy is, and we don't know what he's going to do. I saw something in front of that bar I've never seen before, and I have no desire to see it again. Sandy, Tom was my best friend. Yeah, well Beth was my best friend. What does that got to do with it? It means I've got to do something. Like what? They're both dead. We can't help them now. I don't know, by helping Taylor kill whatever it was that killed them. Don't give me that macho revenge, John Wayne stuff, huh? Then stay. I'm sorry. I can't. Look. Once they almost got me. One of those creatures did that. Why didn't you tell someone? Why didn't you do something? Yeah, sure. You mean like Sarge? You saw the way everybody believed him. No, I'm not. I ain't looking to get locked up. I'm looking to kill me the alien. If he don't kill me first. Hold it. Hold it right there. That's where it is. Behind those trees. That's where the shack is. You sure? I'm sure. Are you staying here? Right there. - Is that it? - Yeah. Hey, be careful there's a hole out there somewhere Sandy fell in. Sarge has been digging them all over the woods trying to catch this thing. You two wait here, I'm going up. No, wait a minute. You can't leave us without any protection. Why don't you give us the gun? Hey, I ain't the crazy one. Remember? It's just like you said. Can we go now? You don't know what you found here. This is where the hunter keeps his food. What are you talking about? We got him right where we want him. Sooner or later he's got to come back for the bodies, and we'll be waiting. Like hell we will. We're not going to be waiting. We're not going to stay here. We're going to leave right now. I'd think about it if I was you. It's a... Take the light and go. Get out of here. Leave me! We've got to get out of here. Here comes somebody. Stop! Here comes another one. Don't worry, I'll stop this one. It's a cop. All right! Yeah. Yeah. Thank God you're the police. Something's chasing us, some kind of creature. They're in the woods, their bodies are in the shack. We can take you to the shack and the bodies, but there's a man out there. He's still hurt. His name is Taylor. He's from around here. Hey look, we're headed the wrong way. Are we going to town. What about Taylor? What about Taylor? We were just out there, with Taylor. He's been wounded by the alien. Now we've got to go back and get him or he's not going to make it. You want me to go back with you, is that right? Yes, please. The man is dying out there. You've got to believe us. Believe a POW, are you kidding? I'm a Sergeant. What'd you do, kill the kids and take over their bodies? What? He thinks that we're the aliens. Well, okay. Okay. You don't have to tell me now. I'll find out soon enough. All right. Get out. Over there. Come on. I'm sure even you creatures feel pain. All right, talk. I've seen experts make people talk. Real experts, believe me. Please don't hurt us. Shut up! Go ahead talk. Sarge, put down the gun, I'll tell you everything okay? I'm not putting down the gun. You tell me... tell me about the invasion force. Okay, okay. I'll tell you, I'll tell you. Where should I start? At the beginning. Alright, I'll start at the beginning. Okay. Your world is divided into seven regions. Each region is a part of the colonization directive, and each region reaches to the center of your planet. Your Earth. Shall I draw it for you? Yeah. Your earth, your world is divided into seven regions. Your America. We anticipate the most resistance here and a few other places. When's all this going to begin? The main striking force begins now. Come on. Show yourself. No use trying to get away! I know you're down there. Just tell me what I want to know. - Which way? - I don't know. Come on! Are you all right? What's the matter? I sprained my ankle. Come on, we've got to get out of here. I'll help you. Easy. That's it. That's it. Okay. Look. Come on. You think anybody's home? I don't know, but we're going to find out. Hello! Anybody home? Looks like somebody lives here. Well, we're not waiting for an invitation. Oh, good, another light. Hello? Anybody home? Oh, we can use their phone. Yeah, if they've got one. This place looks like somebody's vacation cabin, or something. We must have broke in the back door. Hello? Anybody home? Let's check this out. Hello? Hello? Greg? Yeah. Greg, you okay? I found the light. Look, a phone. It's dead. Well, what are we going to do? Well, no matter what, it's safer to stay inside than it is outside. Come on let's check out the rest of this place. There's another light. Great, dead phone, no people, no nothing. Well, I am wet and freezing. - I'm going to check out this closet. - Okay. - Oh, great. Dry clothes. - Terrific. - I'm going to get dressed. Okay? - Okay. You know, we can either hang around here, or we can wait for somebody to show, if there's anybody around. Or we can try and make it back to town. - Okay, ready. - Great. It's bone dry. Looks like nobody's been around here for a while. I used to have a music box like this. What's the matter? Beth, she gave it to me on my ninth birthday. I'll never forget it because she was so excited about it. She bought it six months before. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. Go ahead. Go ahead. It's okay. Come on. Look, look. Why don't you go down... We'll go over here and you can rest for a while, come on. All right. Don't worry about a thing. We won't leave until first light, all right? I'll put your clothes by the heater, they'll be nice and warm. Try and get some rest, all right? - Okay. - Okay. Greg, I just thought of something. What if this place belongs to Sarge? We've got to get out of here. No, no, no. Now just lie back. It's okay. We're safer inside here than we would be outside. No matter what. Now don't worry about anything. Have a little faith in me will you? I'll stand guard. - Okay? - Okay. Okay, now you try and get some rest. I'll put your clothes by the heater. Ten or twelve cups of you should do. Greg! - I saw that horrible creature. - Come on. It was chasing me. I couldn't run. I couldn't see it, and it could see me. I was trapped in this room. It's okay. It's okay. It's just a dream. - It's okay. - I'm sorry. Don't be sorry. It's okay. The door's open. That was no dream. - Maybe the cat got back in. - Yeah, maybe. What if it's the people that own this place? That'd be just great. I can see us making it through this whole mess and then getting shot as a burglar. Look, I'm going to go check it out. You stay here. Oh, no, you're not going to leave me here alone. Don't argue with me. Okay, okay. You lead. - No. - Yeah, that's what I thought. Come on. Is anybody there? We're friends. Hello? Hello? - Don't do that. - Sorry. It's okay. I think it must have been the wind. - What's the matter? - I don't know. I thought I turned this water off. I don't understand. Yeah, yeah, neither do I. I think we better look around again. Didn't I turn that light out? I don't know. I guess so. Are we getting paranoid or what? Come on, you get back to bed. Now look, I've got a pot of coffee going. I'm going to drink it, I'm going to stay awake. Don't worry. I'm going to get you out of this. Yeah, that's nice, I like that. Put your braids down, that'd be nice. Greg! Greg? Are you asleep? Let's get out of here. Come on, let's go. We can't leave Greg back there. Greg's dead honey, we can't do anything for him. - We're going to the shack. - I don't want to go back there. All right you stay here. That thing will be right along. We're talking about him. Why do we have to go back to the shack? Please tell me. Why do we have to go back to the shack? Because we're being hunted. That thing is going to follow us no matter where we go. Right now the only choice we have is where we're going to fight. And if we stand here talking, we're going to lose that choice, too. You don't understand. You don't see. That thing ain't fighting for survival. No siree. This ain't like the Sarge said, that this is an invasion. No. That alien, he came down here for the sport. He wants to get himself a few trophies, and you know what? Right now, you and me, we are the prize game. This is crazy. Yeah, I know it's crazy, - but I got the advantage on him. - Huh? What? What advantage? I'm hunting him and he don't know it. Come on. Come on let's go! Come on! When the alien took off after you, I doubled back here and rigged this shack with enough dynamite to blow him halfway back to wherever he came from. Use the scope. It's by the door, on the right side. - Did you see it? - Yeah, yeah. Look, let me have the gun. What makes you so sure that the alien's going to come back here? Because a hunter always comes back for his game. He's got his catch stored in there. All I've got to do is hit this plunger. Yeah. And boom. Goodbye alien. Don't be afraid. It's going to work all right. Yeah. - Get you to a doctor? - Yeah. Aliens don't need doctors. Over there. Come on now, take it easy Sarge. This is me, Joe Taylor. Heck, you know me. We've been hunting together. You can't fool me. You're not Joe Taylor. The Joe Taylor I know was a man. You took over his body. I hate to think what you aliens did to the real Joe Taylor. What? This is crazy, man. You know this guy. We're human, just like you. I did know him, and he was a good friend. I lost a lot of friends in this jungle. Oh, now listen Sarge, this ain't no jungle. This is the United States. You're home. You've come back home Sarge. You're not going to convince me you're Joe Taylor. No chance. No help. No escape. I knew I'd get one of you. I knew it. You one of the leaders? Or just a soldier huh? I got you. I got you. Yeah. I knew I'd get you. I got you. It's going to be all right. They all laughed at me. They said I was crazy, but now they're going to know. Yes, they're going to know. Keep going. A little closer to the shack. Keep going. - You're going to kill both of them. - If I have to, yeah. I was very worried when you made me do that to the sheriff, but now it's going to be all right. Yeah, they're going to thank me. I knew what was going on around here. I knew.
