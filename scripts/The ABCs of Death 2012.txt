No one would have realized it was me. Everything would work. It all went smoothly. 'Cause? 'Cause I heard the news all morning and I do not have any time. I'm sorry, it was going to be better. But we had no time. I do not get to sleep. But Its almost... Almost eight. Go to your room. I'll Be right there. What do you want? My parents have lent me the house with one condition. Lets, do nothing. Look, Xo, you should sleep. Being a child is a bitch, I know, but that's how things are. But in my home I do not go to sleep until 10. Look, In this neighbourhood children go to bed early. 'Cause otherwise.. The Abominable Snowman comes. But there is no snow here. Tell him when he comes to pick you up. Your uncle is wrong. Hes my cousin, not my uncle. Yes, my dear, it does not snow in Mexico City. Any idiot knows that. But many, many years ago, there was a snowstorm that covered the city. Came from the distant region of Nepal and stopped here. For 40 days the sun barely came out. Snowing every day. People could not get out. And therefore it took them so much time to understand what was happening. Many children disappeared from their homes. You know what happened to them? But your uncle knows, right? They were found... dead. Dead, of course. But that was not the worst part. Their hearts were torn away. Then they realized that whoever had done it, only ate hearts of children. When they finally found him, one of the most bloodiest battles in history took place. The battle was so long that in 1958 the government had to make a truce. Benito Juarez agreed with the Snowman, that could live in a cold-storage container. But on one condition: He could only go out at night. And take the kids that were not in bed after eight. They don't need to be awake, but sleeping in bed. But they have to show good will, if they are not asleep. And at least must count the sheep. And how is he? He sounds a bell and has a cart where he puts the bodies of children. And shouts! Sure... Is he the Bogeyman? If you had to choose, choose the Bogeyman. It's the kind of person that will only abduct you. The Snowman from Mexico rips out your little heart and before you die, you see him eat it. Did you hear? Fast, Xochitl, close your eyes. Close your eyes. Do not make noise. If you have to do something, do it well. She wont come out. Oh, the garbage man... or my mother will kill me. Scare her with the garbage man... you're a bitch. Goodnight. 97 sheep, 98 sheep, 99 sheep... One sheep, two sheep, three sheep... Bruce? All right? I heard a noise. I heard a noise. Go see. Bruce? Bruce, did you see? Alice? Alice? I heard a noise. I heard a noise. Go see. Alice? Alice? Bruce? All right? Buddy. This is because I stuck my finger in you, isn't it? Oh, come on, baby, don't be like that. Well, when are we gonna get together? When are we gonna meet up? No, no, tomorrow. It's just my ear. It hurts a little bit. I got you, you little son... Fuck you! Japan, we have always believed, was a country protected by the gods. But I do not believe there is a God Also, if there really is a God, sensitive girls wouldn't be ashamedso, if they had to fart. Good morning. Miss Yumi, were you looking? Oh, no! I'm so embarassed. I saw that you did! Instead of God, I believe Miss Yumi is protecting me. When I'm with Miss Yumi, I feel very happy. And uncontrollable itching sensation grows in my breast. So gentle and pure... I wonder if Miss Yumi can make a noise so shameful. Just then, we felt the anger of God toward us. An earthquake! Ground started to shake! - Gas! Here comes the gas! - Run! Or maybe the black gas was a fart of God? Miss Yumi! I do not want to die in the gas! If I must die... Its your gas I want to die in! Okay. As long as you do not mind if it stinks. Miss Yumi! What a nice ass! Here it comes! Miss Yumi all... It stinks! Miss Yumi and I have the same kind of animal smell inside. I'm so happy! The land of the dead is not ' place for things pure and clean. Let us pass beyond the boundaries of good taste and to become one. Miss Yumi! I think I have to fart. And now, Introducing that army charmer, that navy-baby, The marine-queen, the lady who's middle name is 'ka-boom'! Frau scheisse? Rowr. Bertie. Bertie. Keep calm, my son... And carry on. Never surrender! Fight! I am... not an intruder... nor a stranger... nor someone else. Ironic, is not it? You've changed. You've changed. Marked. And you know? You are not brave. Neither unique nor original. You are so trivial. So primitive. I do not even remember how I ended up here. I... I came involuntarily. Without worry. Now? I give up? I haven't considered this aspect. I did'nt knew this would happen. I... The one who has ceased to exist... The one who isn't anymore. What wrong, Kawabe? Ooh la la! Help me, please. Not yet! Fucking sick! Fucking sick! Do not you dare! Wait, wait. No! Give me another chance! ' why can't we be like this? Every day? I'll make you so proud of me... we could be... so perfect you will see you will-will... you will... Here! Beautiful, isn't it? You brought something else, Shane? Don't. I'm scared of bird flu. Come on, there was a lot of traffic and I took this bird. Why buy it then? Was it expensive? Do not tell me that you have spent all my money. Not 'expensive look. So what? Watch! Spin. No nothing. All the birds know it. Do you have something to say to mom? Go Hello, Anne. You are beautiful. Boring. Tell me something I do not know. I got it just yesterday and I spent the whole night to teach him to speak. You marry me? Marry me, please . Marry me, please... Will you marry me? Do not be afraid, Joy. My girlfriend doesn't know anything. Do not be afraid, Joy. My girlfriend doesn't know anything. Who's' Joy? What the hell... mustl have learned from a movie. Mine is big might hirt a bit. Mine is big might hirt a bit. Mine is big might hirt a bit. Oh, Shane! It 'great! What the hell! Say hello to your mother just bird! Oh, how nice! Shane, you're fantastic! Damn Shane! God damn it. None of this is working. This is a fucking disaster. OK, that was good. Could you give me one more of those? Just like less high pitched and more just like terrified And kind of make it a little longer too, if you could. Okay. It's not my fault we got the letter 'q. ' - That's you being disrespected. - I know. Did you see the press release? I was last! Yeah, I saw that. You were even after nacho vigalondo. Besides... 5 grand? How do they expect us To make any kind of movie for five thousand dollars? Alright. So what are we going to do To make our segment stand out? What if our "a. B.C.S of death" short Is the only segment in the entire film To feature an actual on-screen death, Like, like somebody actually dies? Actually, that's a great idea. Like we kill an animal or something? Yeah, it wouldn't have to be a person. We could kill an animal. Nobody gives a shit about animals. But what animal could we kill? - It's gotta start with a 'q'... - A 'q'. Or something to do with a 'q. ' A fucking 'q'. Actually, he's kind of cute. - Yeah, he is. - Hey, mr. Quackers, come here. Yes, yes... fuck! Let's kill this fucking duck. Juan, you might wanna back up just a little bit. Alright. OK, so how do we wanna do this? Well, we gotta make sure we pretty much kill it right away. - We don't want it to suffer too much. - Right, right, right, Yeah, yeah. This isn't a snuff film, this is art. Ducks die all the time for food. OK... Yeah, yeah. This is what you eat, america! You american pigs! They're the real killers, not us. That's right, yeah. Hey, juan, We're gonna just tail-slate this. Is that cool? Alright... So on the count of three? - Yeah, that sounds good. - Alright. One... Two... Hold on a second. Can you just shoot the duck? I mean I... I know it's my... you know, thing... But if you would shoot the duck, I'd appreciate it. Yeah, yeah, I got it. OK... One... Two... This fucking thing, goddamnit. - You got the safety on? - You know, I don't even know what side it's on. Yeah, it's that thing sticking out the side right there. Oh, oh shit! Let go of me, you crazy assed bitch! What you're trying to do, can't be done. Hell's coming down on you. I'm just along for the ride, baby. - Want me to shoot you? - You can't kill me. Lucky! Yeah, woo-fucking-hoo, it's my lucky day, you fucking psycho! Enjoy the ride, bitch! Fuck you! Motherfucker! You'll never outrun him, you crazy junkie bitch! - Shut up, bitch! - Fuck you! You fucking whore! Close your eyes... fuck. For the first time in a long time - I'm impressed. - Good. Now leave me alone. Take her. She's given up and you know it. You cunt! Na... It's not her time! Please... Leave me alone. There's still so much I wanna do. You gave me a run for my money. Nobody's ever made me chase them that hard before, But you can't run forever. Fuck! - It's showtime! - I can't understand Why he's so afraid of the toilet. Well, for young boys the most common cause Of genital injury is when the toilet seat falls down. He's not gonna have that problem if he's going for a poo. Loads of people have died on the toilet. - Like who? - Elvis. - He died on the bathroom floor. - Yeah! Died on the toilet and then fell over. If I were him, I'd be more scared of those screws I put in. They're the wrong size. Honey, you go do a poo poo. There's nothing to be afraid of. Danny glover had nothing to be afraid of in "lethal weapon 2." We might even have A lethal weapon of his own in a moment. Bleeding hell fire. That's odd. That's really odd. Look at the state... What on earth? Call the plumber now. It's an emergency. What? Help! You fucking bastard! Hey! Hey! Wake up. He's finally using the toilet... About fucking time. Stand back! He's spitting. He's spitting! Hold him! Get in! E nomine patris... I've got hold of it... don't! Nooooo! Be careful, man! He's in here, I heard something! I can hear it breathing! Come on, let's go! Wake up! Wake up! I'll make you one promise... Your children will never know how this ended. See? Father... Finish it! Geoff... The world is dying. It's one of the reasons We implemented the infant sterilization act. Still, every citizen has the right To earn back their fertility permits. The fastest route has always been Through service to propagation control. Oh yes, sir, it's why I joined... That and making the world a safer place, of course. Of course. Why do you want children? Propagation control... You are charged with acts of terror through illegal propagation. You are hereby ordered to surrender all contraband. Please, you don't know what they'll do to him. - It's not up to me. - I'm sorry, There's been a misunderstanding. You've already verified our permits. A misunderstanding... The illegals have escaped. We're free to go. Free to go... No! Bad, nezbit, bad! Calm down, officer. Your nezbit unit simply auto-responded To para-psychic activity. Commander stoker... Congratulations, You've dispatched a rather dangerous group of mentals. - Mentals? - Telekinesis, telepathy, Mind control... all very real... All valuable genetic materials. "Materials"? We just killed a child. Oh, it wasn't alive to begin with. Not by law. The rebels were delivering the child To the vatic, "prophet" of all mentals. With such power, his very existence threatens humanity, But, once we've reanimated And bio-vac'd every last bit of brain matter, We may finally ascertain his location. A fine achievement, officer. You see, the agency has a far greater purpose than its... "public position. " You've given ten years of service to your unit, officer. Your records are excellent. I'm pleased to say that your permits have been approved. Sir... - Yes, sir. - I'm not finished... While your permits are approved, There are biological factors beyond the agency's control. Reanimate the infant. I can't let you do this. Nezbit, officer lainey has clearly been compromised. Arrest her. I won't let you re-murder a child. Oh, grow up! Better a cruel truth than a comfortable delusion. Sir... Sir, the baby is... Where'd he go? Sir? Did you hear that? It's a mental, idiot! Shoot for the head! Oh, shit... Such vitality... I'll keep the corpse alive for weeks... Wasn't taking him to the prophet. Farm every burning neuron... He is the prophet. Feast on his pain. - Take him... - Unite the mentals... You're his mother now. Scream, witch. Noone will hear you as I harvest your intestines. What? Unhand her, witch! - Willowford! - Wendy! - Save me! - Now, warlock! - What the fuck? - What's up, tommy? - Where the fuck have you been? - Look, the thing's almost done. - What is that!? - Well it's for animated... It's the last frame of the animation I've been working on, remember? - Animation? - Yeah. We weren't even supposed to have animation. Well, I thought we talked about a bunch of different ideas, remember? Look at this list of, 'w's I got here. Oh my god, what the fuck is wrong with you? We're gonna get this done. Hold on, it's a... - Why do you do this? - Here's the thing, walrus, It's like a godzilla-walrus. It's a city... people are being destroyed, you pan over, it's a walrus. 'W.' - OK, do you have a city? - No. - Do you have a guy in a walrus outfit? - No. - Can you do that by this weekend? - No. Well, what the fuck are you talking about then? - Warrior. - Super hot chick. She's just killed a bunch of, like... Trolls? Alright, whatever, she's covered in blood. OK. Let's do that. Lets do that this weekend. I'm not sure that I want to do that one. I'm just saying it's an idea... W' is for wheelchair. It's an old man. An evil old man. He's in the wheelchair... everybody hates old people. He gets pushed off a fucking cliff. I got it... I got... I got nothing. You guys! You gotta come to the conference room. Come on, you gotta see this! Nancy, I'm coming to you from downtown hollywood, And I've got to tell you, some of the strangest things I have ever seen... - Oh fuck, what's going on? - ... Are going on right now. If you can see, over my head, The most oddest looking colored gases. They're like chemtrails, I guess, And they seem to be followed by other planes and copters, and a general sense... - 'w'! - Of panic seems to have hit the area. Believe it or not, nancy, we're actually getting reports Of people seeing clown zombies in the streets. Fuckin' clown zombies? That's fucking stupid! What are they looking for? Magnets? I just... Is that a 'w' on there? What's up with these 'w's? Is this some kind of self-fulfilling prophecy, As we watch the horror Of our own minds Pushing humanity toward extinction? Can we live in a world That is more immoral than our own brains, - Our own ideas... - No! Don't open the door! We live in a process that is already infested, Already mutated, already over! Already blank... From a wave of congealed confidence! My elbows are untouchable!! My elbows are sharp!! I am transparent. I am solid in the form of this new liberty reborn! You are invisible in this new world! I hover above you... Above as below. I am legion. A traced mindfuck of a billion bombs Dropping on your fired synapses, Your tired synapses! You are inserted, digested, gestated! Lie in the waste of your own vision, Gutter punks to bigger words that you ate years ago! That you tasted and shat upon years ago! That you chewed and corrupted after the seeds were buried long ago! I am the one with seven heads! I am the thing that laughs! I am the thing that waits... For you! What the fuck? Heck, I do not believe Fucking fat girl. So, so. - Look. Hey, gelatin. - Hey, wait. Miss, excuse me. You have to do something after a while. - I know. Thank you. Thank you. - You see. Have you starred in Jurassic Park? You were the Brontosaurus? Go, Go. Oh, God, look at her. Hey, take a break on the peanut butter. Oh my gosh, if I were her, I wouldn't go out. Oh, my God, it's true. For sure. She can't climb up the stairs. Take a ride to the gym! Me, with my cereal I can manage my summer slimness. Slimness, flat tummy... Get ready for the summer. With low dye... Say no to fat! Rich in vitamins... My body loves it, as you can see! Diet cereals make me lose weight and help me stay in shape. Me, for my hair, I use Protif! Me, with my cereal I can manage my summer... With low dye, rich in Vitamins... My body loves it, as you can see! March 11th, radioactivity completely covered our shitty country, Japan. The Rising Sun was flooded with cesium. Our soft bellied government officials have covered up everything. And our DNA underwent a violent transformation. Our cells were changed forever. And the people of Japan welcomed a new century of mutants. The Japanese food products are completely safe. Nuclear energy is also safe. It's a gift from our beautiful and beloved, nice country America. Our technology is simple. Even an inferior nation can use it. It is fully automatic and indestructible. Our talented personnel are totally talented And our shitty bastards are perfectly shitty. White means white-skinned human. Not black, nor yellow, nor red. Made in America. Ever since Kunta Kinte and was abducted by America, the blacks have harbored a hatred for the whites. Let's change the way of saying 'Nuclear Energy'. It's more accurate to say 'Fission-Cultivated Electricity'. Have no fear, small and light-weight. The outer walls are made more thin and weak than usual. We yellow people love tangerines! Japanese are superior sons of bitches! My Emperor! It is standing! Watch a horror movie right there on my tv? Horror movie right there on my tv? Horror movie right there on my tv?
