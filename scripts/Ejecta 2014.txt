Sorry about the build up. I could feel them. I could...I could hear them inside. Pretty much on me. They had this...meeting. and then they left. Stay alert. See if you can get it. And that was it? No, that wasn't it. They left something behind. Something inside of me that's been there ever since. Approaching the house. Stay tight. When I'm awake, it hurts. But when I'm... When I'm not, it floods me with these nightmares. Nightmares, no. Nightmares, it's not nightmares. It...it's not a thing, it... it's a feeling. It...it's not pain, it's not... it's not fear. It...it's something else. It's something much, much worse. Go, go. Move. Go. You hit. Why don't you take a few painkillers before bed, just knock yourself out? I've tried everything. Everything. Everything? And it just never works. No fatigue. Stroke. Got you. Please stay tight. Stay tight! Fuck! What the fuck! You should get some help. Oh, I've... I've seen doctors. And they say I'm in peak of physical health. All I need is a little more sleep. -What the hell did you do? -Something was there. What are you doing? I saw it, sir. It was right behind Stevenson. What the fuck? So, did you try it? No. All I allow myself is a few hours of sleep every few days. Go ahead, move! Bring it in! Target's on you. Take it! Take it! Target's on you! Go, go, go! Pull out! Pull out! If a doctor tells you to sleep, maybe you should sleep. -You don't understand. There is something inside of me that... a comfortable pillow will not fix! -Will! I believe you, I do. I'm making this film so that other people will believe you,too. I don't care if people believe me or not. Yes, you do. We've been discussing it for years. If you don't care what other people think, then what do you want? I just want someone to tell me how to make it stop! How to pull it out of my head! I cannot...cannot close my eyes for them to tear them out! Alright, men! Put a bullet through my head! I fear that... that... The...the...anticipation... of...of...this feeling... eats away at my life. Hold your fire! I need that man alive, do you hear me? Put your goddam gun away, rookie. Bullets through and through. But he's alive. Do you understand? Tell me what it feels like. Does it hurt? It hurts! OK? It...it hurts. Do you know how to follow orders, soldier? Do you know how to follow orders? You almost killed one of my men in my target. Copy that. Don't worry about it, soldier. This is how we follow orders, soldier. No! No! I've always found it strange that humans even bother to try and imagine the end of the world. Staging areas, ships to flee on, lotteries for tickets off the planet. We're all so stupid. The beginning of the end as they say. But that's long begun by now. Truth is when it hits, You will simply cease to do the stupid little things that you do. Just like that. Ten month... if it's the big one... like the sun storm of 1859, the carrying event as it's called, Then there's no such thing as tomorrow. She lifts up the sun like a fiery wing. It whips back and snaps. She breaks loose. Cosmic inferno like a moveable hell sprays millions and millions of miles as if it were nothing. A cough. A sneeze. And then, it hits us. Yes indeed. It's going to hit us. And when it hits us, When it comes crashing through our flimsy atmosphere, the good will collapse, the magnetic poles reverse, And you know what that means? The entire surface of the planet heaves. Its molten heart bursts! And we all drown in a lake of eternal fire! Then we go to Jesus! Maybe we could just get a little lecture. That's all for now, folks. I have a scar. I'm telling you. Just show it off and bang! There it was on the radar. I don't know, man. I wouldn't get too excited. Seen him before. Ha, ha, ha. As was our cliche. Opened his eyes. Almost blew over our head. Never seen him so sure of himself. Sir? Are you okay? Can we get you something? Who are you? We're the good guys. We're here to help. Whose blood is that on your shirt? Mine. They shot me. They shot you because you ran. Bad things happen when you disobey. It's best if you learn that now. Let me go. Sit still and let's talk. We lost a rookie tonight. He was a good kid. I don't know about you, but we want to end the bloodshed. -And you can help us by giving us some answers. -I don't know anything. Oh, come now, that's not true. What about... the planets in our solar system? I'm sure you know those. -Mars... -Saturn. Thank you, agent. I have a feeling he's aware. Now. I'm curious what he knows about things from a little further away. Let me go! -Let me go! -You need to calm down! Just...relax. I told you... to sit still, old man. And you don't listen very well, do you spider Nevi? Please have Heather prep the prep helmet. Now! Please and thank you. William Cassidy. I must apologize. William Cassidy is our guest... He's part of our team. You know, you look a little bit rough. I have to admit. But I I did not expect that you would look quite so old. Might be time to update the profile picture on your website. William, I would like you and I to hit the reset button right now. I want to like you and I want you to like me. I'm a firm believer in straightforward conversation. If you and I would have a straightforward conversation between friends, then we'll have a wonderful outcome today. It's so easy. Don't you agree? I will assume that you agree, and that you're not being difficult right now So, let's start with a very easy question. What happened last night? I'm going to ask you a few questions on camera, OK? Is that all? Yeah. OK? Yeah. So sorry about the confusion before, but Can I ask you if my name rings a bell at all? Why? What is it again? Joe. Joe Sullivan? I got an email from you the other night. No. I never give out... personal information online ever. OK. I'm here with... Bill Cassidy. Let me just say that I have been following your story for years. And I'm doing a documentary. Extra-Terrestrial activity. Things...beyond our atmosphere. So, it's obviously a pleasure to meet you. Yeah...Uh... So the first question is: You were abducted by aliens thirty-nine years ago? I never said abducted. Something came to me. OK, good, That's what I want. I want to hear what happened in your own words. My own words? I met an advanced life form...from somewhere else. You met them. What does that mean? They came here through the front door, just like you. And you just let them in? No. I didn't have much choice. They threatened you? No. They control me. So, what did they look like? Hit William hard. Please. That's it, agent. Thank you! I'm sorry, William. Sometimes you really have to hit that reset button. Now that you are clear on what our expectations are, you should accept them. On the one hand, you could disclose the events of the twelve hours or so, And on the other hand, just not really hand at all, it's more of a toolbox of devices that you really never want to have to see. Tell me everything you know, William. I know all of you people. Strange, William. Very, very strange you with your history. You've been staring at the sky for decades now. Posting your theories online? Unbelievable ideas, some would say. We've had our eye on you most of your life, now. Sorry. No autographs today. Last night, there was a coronal mass injection. You know about it. You were a part of it. Historic. Bigger than the Carrington event. This is kidnapping. It knocked something out of the sky. Didn't it, William? Do you want to know what I can't get my head around? There are so many people out there just like yourself, Colorful folks, just like you, who have knowledge of or had experience with visitors. Yours was what? Thirty-nine years ago? How wonderfully vindicating it must be for you... to have one crash in your backyard just last night! Or is that just too much coincidence for your weak little story to pair? It's separate. You find it funny they're hitting me. Squaring with the enemy. Over the years it's gotten more drastic. Usually I just wake up in bed screaming. Sometimes, I wake up in other places. Yeah? Like where? In front of the computer, staring at sites I've never heard of. Sometimes outside. I've woken up walking down the highway. I've woken up floating on water. No shorts...I... I woke up two states over. Two weeks had passed. I had no idea how I got there. It had been erased from my memory. Once, I woke up in a field fifteen miles from here. I was covered in blood. There was a horse on the ground in front of me. It...it...had...been cut down the center. Its insides removed and laid out and displayed in the grass like an internal...road map. Why don't we talk about something else for a second? Like... tonight's mass ejection. Yeah, it should...should be interesting. Yeah... Solar flares in. traveled millions of miles here and burst through our atmosphere tonight. Yeah. There's nothing else here that should be interesting on the ship. They say it's going to interfere with the whole grid. World-wide blackout. Grounded all the flights. Systems... ...might get knocked out of the sky. All the transit's been shut down. I look forward to it. Nature has a way of mixing things up. Humans really are not in control. We'd like you to hook up the platform. Let's put a couple of holes into William's head. And see what we see. You want to know more about it? No? Well, it's too bad. It's less destructive if you know what to expect. Is that comfortable? -Heather! Please don't do that. It's just...when our subjects are more comfortable, we actually get better results. Just...stop talking. And finish. Yes, Doctor. Doctor, we got something. It's about time! What I got here? equals square circle. It appears we have an abandoned truck. The back of the truck is clear. The truck is clear. -Copy that. Some blood. Something else. Protecting... You know what we're looking at here, William? I've made this truck. Hey, your insides seem valuable. Must be your pest helmet, doc. I'm seeing a bunch of blood. Doctor? You're gonna want to see this. OK, bring it in. Copy that. There's a substance here. What is it? Definitely foreign. Sir? It's not human. Care to tell me what you know about this truck, Bill? No. So, you might feel a little sting here. That's not really a sting. Kind of...kind of like a hot blade slowly digging around in your head. What is this thing? Oh! So now you're interested. It pulls your thoughts out of your mind. No, we don't really know how it actually works, we usually get the results we're looking for. Unfortunately,there's some undesirable side effects for the subjects. You know, it took a hundred years before anybody could figure out how to turn it on. Isn't that interesting? What happened last night, Bill? That's a funny one. Can I have some more, please? Did I tell you that we have figured out how it pulls your mind out of your head but we have no idea how to put it back in? They're so... Give me some more juice. Keep at it, girl! Turn it up! Turn it off! Check her! What the fuck just happened here? Take that off. You crazy? Good? Please take that device off of your friend's head. Now. I order you. Get rid of her! Is that the camera, soldier? Bring it in. Put it on the monitor. Thank you, soldier. Hey, everybody. Joe Sullivan here. Sully5433 I just got the most amazing email last night. While I was sleeping, I got contacted by a god. OK? Hello Joe Sullivan. I would like you to come meet me at the address below tomorrow. Spider Nevi. Spider Nevi... He's the whale of astronomy. People have been trying to find this guy for years. But he doesn't want to be found. He's off the radar, he's off the grid, not even the government knows where he is. He contacted me. Maybe...maybe he wants me to film him. Maybe he wants to talk about the mass ejections tonight. I mean, There are some crazy shit going on in the atmosphere and he decides to contact me? I mean, this guy's been blogging about an alien experience for years, the things that he's writing about, the concepts and the ideas, they're just so... Anyway...I'm backed up. I'm going to need the help. Let's go. That's where we're going. Right over that ridge. I've got zero idea if this is anywhere close to real or a total scam. All we know is what this guy looks like and that he goes by Spider-man Fuck. That sounds made up. Not sure what to make of this. What the hell? Jesus...the tanks...? I wonder if we can get closer? Howdy. Hi sir. My name is Joe Sullivan. Hi, Joe. Is that a camera? Uh? -Yeah. Are you filming me right now? -No sir. -I don't believe you. You're a liar. Why you got a camera sitting there pointing at me? -I'm making a film. Uh... -Oh, you're making a movie. I am, sir. You think there are some interesting people up here, aren't there? Go fuck yourself today. What about tomorrow? Hi. Hi there. My name is...Joe. Hey! I'm Joe Sullivan. How you doin'? Hello. My name is Joseph Sullivan. Filmmaker. Astronomer. It's really stupid. Alright. Here we go. This is perfect. Hello? Hello! Anybody here? He's coming...Jesus! Oh. Hey. Ha. You...just... snuck up on me there. Hi, I'm...I'm Joe. It's... Uh... Joe Sullivan. You... You sent me an... ...email last night? Uh...you're Spider Nevy? Um... Listen, I...I just... want to talk to you for a few minutes on camera if...if... Uh, I'm not going to take up too much of your time, I just... I assume you want to tell your story. You know, I'm a filmmaker, I'm not I'm not some weirdo. I have read everything you've written... ...I've watched everything you have posted online... ...And I believe your story and I and I'm not here to debunk I'm not here to make fun of you or eh...you know. Um...I'm here to... listen...that's...that's all I'm here to do. I mean,hey...if this isn't a good time, I can always I can always come back or... you know, we can just... you can give me one of those beers and... We don't even have to talk on camera or anything like that. I can just put it down and just talk. Oh... No...no...no... No...no... Aah! Fascinating. Completely. Fascinating. I have put that on hundreds of people. And there is never anything left, any, nothing. But William... There's still plenty of you in there isn't there? Something's different. It is? What? What's different? It's changed. It's stronger. More vicious. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I don't want to see you in pain. You and I, Bill, we share a mission. I'm not going to have a mission. -Yeah. Yes, you do. Oh, but you do have a mission. That same creature that contacted you contacted us. Do you know when, Bill? One thousand three hundred and sixty-five years ago. And we have been trying to return the call ever since. We can help each other. Then... we can help you find the proof that you need. I don't need anybody to find proof. I just want it to stop. I know, I know, I understand. We can help you. Where is it, Bill? Is it with Joe Sullivan? It's not with anybody. OK. Come on. Come on, William. I feel like I'm being much more honest with you than you are with me right now. He'll hurt anybody. Erase anybody. So, Bill, what are we going to see out here tonight? Fluctuations in the sky. Colors are ripples as it bursts through the sky's atmosphere. This energy is traveling 1,500 miles a second. and almost 500 million miles to get to us, and when it hits, Ugh. Ugh.. Bill? Ugh. Bill, are you alright? Ugh,- there is something out there. -Ugh, I think it... Oh, my God, Bill, look. Oh! Look. Look at it, Bill. Look. Seriously. What's happening, Bill? What's happened? -They're here. I can feel them. Who's here? Bill, who's here? They found me. And they've come back. What are you saying? -Look. Look. You see? Don't you see? -Please, just tell me. Tell me what I'm looking at here. Look...I told you. They didn't believe me. Platoon. It's coming. Look. Come on. Up there. It's...It's... Follow, follow me, follow. Look. No. No! Bill, don't. Bill. -Bill... -Shh! Bill, wait! Wait! Wait! Wait. Wait. Bill, I don't know where I'm going. Bill... Shit! Joe! Over here! Hang on, Bill. My God! Look at this! Oh... Look! Over here, too. My God! Oh... Oh, my God! Don't get too close, Bill. Oh... Bill! Run. Run! Bill! Bill! Shit! Bill, I need you to tell me what it is we are looking at here. What do you think you are looking at? William, I'm going to ask you one more time. Tell me what it is that you found there. Is this some sort of game you're playing to get people to believe your story? Spray paint, cardboard, camera tricks, and post on-line for your conspiracy buddies. is that what this is? Or are we looking at something significant here? Yeah. It's significant. If you are fucking with me I will make sure you leave this building cut up into a thousand pieces, burned and pissed on. I haven't much option here. Sounds like I'm losing. All units... we have significant evidence to indicate that an unidentified flying object has split apart in our atmosphere and crashed onto Cassidy's property. A small pod has landed in the forest and the main unit is in the pod. Find me this ship. We're going to fucking die out here. Shut your mouth, soldier. Move quickly and quietly. Appears to be a...substance similar to what we saw at the truck. -OK, sample it for the lab. We got something. The impact is obvious. Seven touchdown. So that's it? That's the second crash site. Find the pod. -Surrounding area is burnt. There's nothing left. There's no ship. No pod. Nothing. You see what we see? There's nothing here. I repeat, nothing is here. We need to move on. No, that's...that's the right site. Doctor, there is no fucking ship. Something must have come and gone. Open your god damned eyes. Ah! Bill? Bill! Oh,Jesus! No yelling. Oh, God. Sorry. Oh, let's see whats happening There's something out there. You're fucking...what? I see...I see it. What is it, Bill? Bill? Bill, what is it? Look! Shh...Bill! Wait! Bill! Bill! It's erased. Bill... No...No... What the fuck is that? I'm gonna shit my pants, man. What the fuck was that? Did you see it? I don't know, Joe. Bill, Bill, wait! Wait, wait! -I knew you had a goddamned camera. Bill? Ah! Ah! Bill! Bill! Bill! Move...fucking move. Shit! Oh, fuck. Move! I don't want to die. Fuck! Oh, shit! Oh...Ah... Where...where am I going? Where am I going? Fuck. What the...? Ow! Shit! The light! Oh, oh, fuck. What is this? What the...what the fuck? Things are about to get very nasty right now. We don't really know what they were originally designed for All I know, is that they cause immense pain. And shut off your body's coping mechanism. Your body's designed to shut off. But with the D-83 shackles, It keeps the pain switch turned on. It's your last chance. Where is that ship? Turn it on! Yeah, you want to tell me where the ship is now, Bill? You had enough now? Hey, you want more? Come on, Agent! Turn it up! Give him more! Ahh! Ahh! Ahhh! Ahhh! Ahhhhh! Ahhhhh You're gonna need more power than that! Hey! Bill? Bill? Bill, come on. Is it out there? Oh, please don't be out there. Oh, fuck. Oh, shit. Weird. Oh. Oh. I'll just...I'll just... OK, OK, OK. OK. Ok. That's just me. It's fine. Oh, fuck! Oh, God! Why are running? You running away? Gotta get way back to the cam. Up the stairs. Shit! get the door! That's not enough! Oh, shit. Bill? Bill! Take the camera! -Look! -The shelf! The noise. Bill, what's that on the fucking roof? Bill, how did they get on the roof? Oh, fuck! Son of a bitch! It's back. At the car site. Back up, back up! Ahhhhhh! Ah! Ah! You can do it. Stevens! Ok, what happened, soldier? I lost my feed. Something grabbed Stevens at the grid. Stevens!!!! Anybody got eyes on him? Go ahead into his last location. Did he say what he saw? Negative. All we heard was too fucked up sound, then silence. It ain't human. It's got to be extra-terrestrial. Stevens!! Stay close. keep your eyes open. Stevens! Stevens. Stevens. Stevens! Got a bunch of them live. Stevens is gone. Fuck! Tracks. That side... Both of you. Ok, keep following. I want you to find something, Find some answers here. Nothing for a while. It's been about an hour. I was thinking...I think he's gone. Nothing's moved out there. I don't know. What are we gonna do? I just want to be backing off that truck and getting the fuck out of here. Yeah, well, just stay put. I'll haunt after daylight. Huh.. We got a gun. If we could see it, we can shoot it. It's just you and me in the end of the world. Uh... Yeah. Let's get out of here. Ok. It's a fucking light! Jesus freaking Christ. Clear. Yeah. Where is the truck keys? What? Wait a minute, truck keys? What the hell does it look like? Ahh! Jesus, fuckin bullshit! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Where's the gun? It...it...it bounced out of my hand. I don't know. Did you forget? Maybe...I don't know. What about the roof? Bill! Here! Here, over here! Can that thing get through that fucking bed? Ok! Move! hey! One...two...three... Fuck it! 3...2...1! The door! We can't stay here. Where else are we gonna go? It's gone. Bill! I fucked my ankle. No, no, no,no...move... Got them...? Not on one key What does it look like?

Where did it go? It was crawling right there. Ok, let's get out of here! Hold on... -No. Let's go! I think it's dead. Dead? What? What? It was bleeding very loud and it collapsed though there. It stopped. Ok, great. That's fucking cool. Wait there. No. No. No, fuck you. Uh! Ah! We have confirmation of contact. Yes. A video recording, sir. I'm going to see it now. You have my full understanding, sir. I will be waiting your arrival. Fuck, come on, Bill! Bill, Bill, where are you? Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck. Oh... Ah! Ah! Bill! Bill! Oh! Bill, Bill!! You've got to see this! What? What? Who's in your camera? What are you doing? Come here. My god! Hello? Who are you? I knew it was you! I've been waiting. Please, I...I'm needing help. Destroy them. I'm... I'm nothing. I'm nothing! Ahhhh! Ahhh! Ahhh! Enough with the screaming already. It doesn't matter now. I've contacted council. They will be here in a matter of hours. You'll be in their hands now and let me tell you, Bill, their hands are a lot rougher than mine. We're moving...we've got some sound... It's here. creature is here. No! Hold your fire! Hold your fire, god damn it! Fucking idiots! You fucking chicken shit morons! Don't just stand there staring! Go get them. Toggle that. Fuck me. There's a man. He's pretty fucked up. He's gotten the same substance as the crash site. Oh, my God, I don't believe it. That's... That's Joe Sullivan. Repeat. Same substance from the truck. And at the crash sight. Is he alive? He'll survive. Bring him to me now. Copy. Did you hear that, William? We're going to have a guest. You sure it's dead? It's not breathing. Uh, Bill... We should...We should call someone. You focus on what you're doing. Listen...What is that? Whoa! Oh! Get the tape! Run! Bill. Hey Bill. Why don't we call the cops? No,we should... We call the cops and they can come and then they can call whenever and We can call the army and the national guard This isn't right. I need we need the new suppliers. Wow... Shit. I don't feel good. I wanna go home. Yeah...I wanna go home. Bill, there's something wrong. Can you focus for a goddamned second? Good. -I saw that. -I'm sorry. Will you clean that shit up? What? What are you talking about? - Clean that shit up! -I'm sorry, Bill. Bill. Bill! Joe, Joe, Joe, Joe. Joe. Joe. Shit! -Fuck... -I'm sorry about that. Before...the police...the camera. Is all in here.

Come on. Look. Look at this. Look. See? Isn't it lovable? It's good. The same thing that's inside of here is inside of me There's something bigger controlling us both. And I've got you. What's that? What? What's that? What's going on? We gotta go! Look. I got a visual! There he is! Target's on me. Take them! take them! Target's on you. Go! Go! Pull out! Pull out! in time, men. It's on you! My name is Joseph Sullivan. What you've just seen is 100 That's not exactly how you thought it would end, huh? Don't worry, William. That's not the end for you. It's just the start of a long life. Locked up in a cage... squealing like a dog while they stuff you like a pig. I'm not afraid of you. What do you want? You! do...suffer! We will find you! No you won't. We are in a heavily guarded facility here. You brought us! Listen to me, you cocky fuck! We ripped apart your granddaddy in the sixties We'll rip apart you just the same! You will suffer most! You will suffer most!!! We're approaching the facility with Joe Sullivan. He's not conscious. I hope you're ready for this. Aboart! Aboart! Do not bring Joe Sullivan here! Kill subject immediately. Do not bring him here! Kill him! There's been a breach! Officer! Let him locked out! What happened? They're here. Please...let me go... Help me. What do I do? Tell me. Please, I don't want to die. They won't let you die. Please tell me something. Something that you know. Please. I know they're like me. They may be something more than is humanly possible. I can't imagine what they'll do to you. I guess it's over. Please... Take it up. Make it stop. Make it end. I'm begging you. Well... Congratulations, internet. You win. You deep dulled Sully. I drove for fourteen hours To an address that did not have Spider Nevy I didn't even see the abducter. So... All in all, it ends to an epic fail. I promised you guys a white whale and... I give you nothing. All I've got to show for is this headache. So... I'm going to try and get some sleep. I'll get back after it tomorrow. Hello everybody. My name is Ashley Winnington-Ball and today we're going to look directly at the sun. mass coronal ejection. Sounds odd, huh? As a matter of fact it is.
