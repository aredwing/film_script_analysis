Let's just say I saw the error of my methods and me... realized... qualified candidate you are. - Well, I need to think. - What's to think about? - It is not perfect and in the west. - All right, Mrs. Thatcher. I agree. it need to review your options. Good, bad advice does not sit. No, no, no, I think think we should leave. Good morning Miss Thatcher. I'm not sure should do this. I have. It is your decision. Yes, but it is very stubborn and does not knows what is best for her. But do you? It would of mounted police if given the chance. Will you help to save a life misery and perhaps even death? That's what is supposed to mounted, or police do? All I know is that the old Edward I had done this just for fun. Broken window right! Mission accomplished. Farewell and welcome Weston Coal Valley. Please help! - They 're everywhere! - That does not sound right. Have fun. - I was bitten! - How many were they? Ten. - Please help! - Miss Elizabeth? Miss? Elizabeth? Lots of rats! - Oh, Daddy! - What is it? It was horrible they were everywhere! - What's up, what happens? - What was everywhere? Rats! The house was infested with them. Oh God, I thought it was worse! Elizabeth, are you all right? We hear you scream and came running. You gain little sister! I'm not prepared for any of this! I'll let Mr. Higgins morning that... accept the position... teacher in Weston. I'm not ready for these things like my Aunt Elizabeth. - Where'd you get that? - I... How dare you take something from our safe without permission? Elizabeth did not take it, I did. - You have no right to steal it! - Steal? At least I feel proud. What does that mean? - Maybe I should go. - I apologize, Edward. - Thanks for your concern. - I'm so sorry, Elizabeth. I was just trying to avoid you from making a terrible mistake. Women What have you done? I went to see Mr. Higgins I offered him money if I offered a position to keep you here. Under my care. The paid for offered me a position. I only did it to protect you. Just 22, no I can let you be... somewhere out there... side alone unprotected. The world is very dangerous. And it seems that I am not apt to go West. Or teach here either... I was told you wanted me young. Yes, I think I've done a terrible misjudgment. And I have to confess something. What happened to her dad? With Aunt Elizabeth? Why all the secrecy? Did you have a tragic end? The truth is we do not know. Except for a brief visit after started teaching in Palm... Springs... my little sister left home and never returned home. But we are family. A bed. Sometimes life takes a young person to go their own way. Receive a larger call, one that is more important than anything else. Even the family. Then mom fears we lose ourselves in... the world as a... lost Aunt Elizabeth. Exactly. nature tends to separate... Road... our parents. Human emotions are very complex. By reading her diary, I felt desperately... ... he must follow. Perhaps it is no accident you wear the name of Elizabeth. But considering who I am I think incompetent to attend the call. The fear is becoming stronger in me. I wonder if all this Riot is not only... my way to prove... I 'm not as vulnerable Edward came to me today, to confess... he put his... situations against you. How so? Julie persuaded him to release mice in the cabin. - So it has not changed. - Actually yes. I do not think the old Edward had had the courage to face. But that does not change the fact I was terrified. People who always lives in the Fear tends to never accomplish anything. Except deny themselves the possibility of happiness. I will not fear anymore Then trust who you are. Commit to something. A vision of world, which is larger than... ... yourself. No I do not fulfill God's purpose for your life. I love you Beth. Today I had to say enough is enough. I thought we could use nature to help us with our spelling. For example this small shrub. Bush. A- R -B -U- S -T -O. Now try all. Bush. A- R -B -U- S -T -O. Right. Roca. R -O- C -A. - Yes Andy? - Can I go to the bathroom? Please remember children go to the bathroom after... we will not have school... interruptions, okay? How do you spell that "accident, " as you know... if someone had... had an accident... Carl, maybe you can spell " Donkey of the class. " Andy, you can go. Children, their care here, please. Maybe they can spell synonymous with " accident " as calamity or misfortune. Or do not even know what is a synonym? Children are very easy humble about others with words or other forms. But everyone should try to others as we would be treated. With respect. Now all Stay here and look for anything that... together... they can spell the nature, back in a moment. While searching Andy, knew who was... deeply hurt... by being humiliated, prayed for words right to comfort. Andy, are you all right? I started happening two days ago. I need you to go home to change clothes. - Did you tell the whole class? - No, of course not. Accidents happen to anyone. In fact I have a secret of my own. When he was old used to wetting bed because he was afraid of the dark. So now you know something others do not. - It's a good teacher Miss Thatcher. - Thank you, Andy. It's what I love most. - Julie awake. - What is it? - I 'm going. - Go where? It is the middle of the night. I accept the position of Coal Valley master - No, you will not, now go to bed and let me sleep. I'm serious, I that 's what I do. No. Do not listen. I do not want to go. You odiare if you do, I I swear. I hate you if you let me. Julie did not lose. I'll write to tell me everything that happens. Thus, although this far, neither will feel alone. Julie, please. - You have to follow my councils. - Yes, Mom, for the hundredth time. Shelter me well I promise not to get wet and not go after dark. With snow and winter just around... the corner..., remember to wear socks. Stay warm always, I want a cold caches. Forgive me, I must be brief. Because if not, there will be nothing that prevents you do not let go. I love you, Daddy. I love you too, my little girl. All aboard! My daughter, I want to give you this. So you can cross borders without fear of losing you. And most important for you can find the way home. Very well. Now you can go. Go find out what God has in store for you. Elizabeth wait. I regret what I said. Yes I think your story will have a happy ending. You marry and have children and adventures and challenges... and more adventures... in the years to come. No one had ever told me this. But I prefer to be an adventurer an old school mom. I can not believe you said that. You're my best friend. Well Aunt Elizabeth 's time occupy ourselves more. Teresa, you can approach us. Yes, Miss Thatcher? Andy is not having Good day, do you? No, ma'am. I think we 'd better accompany home, okay? Yes, ma'am. It is really sick and weak. - His parents have taken him to the doctor. - But no money. Sounds like things are difficult for him and his family. Well, maybe. We should help them. - How? - We could make a contribution. As they did for Do school. We could make bread and circus activities. We could sell food to the People like a good meal. - Why not do both? - What do you think Mrs Thatcher? Well, I think it's a fabulous idea. We will play You've had your fun, bye.

Yes, I am, but I return to the same, why are you here? - Did not your father tell you? - Tell me what? Open step. I am your escort Elizabeth. He asked me to got here safely Coal Valley road to my first assignment. And therefore had no right I do not need an escort. The other thing I think. Clearly, but that does not change the fact that I can take care of me perfectly. So feel free jumping off the train. It moves really fast. I did not mean right now, but at the next stop. Well, because until 11 arrive at the following... save and transport... lead us to Coal Valley. - So, yeah, I left happy. - I think I did not hear well. I do not want or need your company.

However knew the do that could destroy... your heart... lovely wife and family. - Miss Thatcher. - Mrs. Delaney. Oh, I feel terrible for not having invited to our meeting ladies.

It would surprise bringing it to a picnic. That's why I'm here. Ms. Delaney... I want that... it is perfectly... clear that I never... you flirt with her husband. Does my husband? What are you saying? Sorry I intruded. I 'd better go. Explain Miss Thatcher. I just came to confront this. - Directly. For perhaps stop - - Stop what? Ms. Delaney has been safe... I know no other way to tell. Her husband has been trying to fall in love. How dare you tell me such a thing? My husband is the kindest and noble in the land. And the fact that this stop here doing these terrible accusations... is... while on a bed hospital is disgusting and pathetic. Is there a problem here? Or your teacher is delusional or have been drinking. He has called my Phillip a womanizer and accuses... have feelings... romantic to her. - You're not the father of Phillip? - Uncle. Oh, my God. - Oh, God, I do not know how... - Please, join us. - No, just... - Let me give you something to drink. No, I'm sorry. Do not know how... I'm sorry, I'll go.

Good. So Wynn Delaney You're not only a farmer. - What then? - A guy like you. Mounted police.

And my aunt had no idea until it was with him to a dance of the mounted police. - I'm told it's an event. - From what I read, it is. I'll have to go some day. I guess they have nothing similar in Coal Valley. Yeah, probably not. May I have this dance, Miss Thatcher? - I do not think that's... - Please. Just in case you do not get the dance of the mounted police. Suddenly I gave a lot of sleep. I want rest before our trip tomorrow. Right. Course. I'd like that. Good night.

You may wonder what will happen with Wynn now that Phillip is home. I have feelings for him and I think he feels the same. It's mounted police, dear. Not only enjoy... good... horses, also a good wage. You think I want to settle down? Even the police Mounties have the right to marry. Like me, he believes strongly.

Until that appeared. Nothing but dresses. nothing jewelry, just books. Where is the money? Are we stupid enough to believe what Travel money? - Please, that's mine. - No more. It is something that my dad gave me. Its value is negligible. Please. - Where is the money? - I'll give you the money. Elizabeth. It's in the seat, in a small chest. That's much better. Let's go. Please, my compass! Sorry, miss, I need it. It's easy to get lost here. but - Untie me. I love that my father will did come to protect me. - Already Maestra or not, Elizabeth? - Yes If you count there were three of them and just one. There is only one you, what would have happened if the comparison? How could you get to Coal Valley? I promised your father that I would there safely and this does not change that. Sorry, you're right. - What do we do now? - 's Move. - How? Frightened horses. - We have feet. You help me a little, Elizabeth? - Your load another. - No, do not take the chests. We can not leave here. These things, Elizabeth, they can be replaced. No, I can at least need take school materials. My major teaching manuals, my collections of literature... Really sorry, but never succeed in Directions to Coal Valley. They are very... heavy... and we are far away. The sooner you understand better.

For this. This province is our connection to the west. What lovely! Please explain. The people here are becoming stronger, tougher, and... in Coal Valley... as if it were your own basic training. So that's how it was for you? In the first weeks I hate my father. For getting me to the service. as you said, I just wanted to go home. Now I see the purpose of pain and pressuring myself. Growing up, I thought life As was to get the world. Got my hand, as if it was my birthright. And then one day, the I light me providence. We were in training basic, going on... a frozen lake... of Suddenly the ice broke. And before I knew it I started to sink to the bottom. Oh, my God! I remember seeing forms blurry, like comets. Revoleteando around my eyes. Then everyone went and left me. And as I was running out of air. I realized how small we are in this universe. And every breath, every moment is a gift. - And how do you survive? - My friends. I refused to give only soon me out of the ice that had fallen. As I drew I realized they all were risking... for me... and all they could drowning me. Then I knew, I knew what my purpose. Risking my life for others. Knowing your purpose. my father more or less said the same thing. I took the liberty of bringing something, I hope you do not mind. I would read it to you.

" Why do I have to die? Why not be improved? To be a child was really nice. Why Miss Thatcher? Andy was so nice. - Why did not improve? - For God did not care for it. - That's not true, Carl. - I agree with Carl. We can not assume that God does not care about me. Just because he died. What is assumed? To assume is to believe something when not have any proof. Like when you took my uncle was my father. Yeah, like that time. Sometimes we take many things and not good to do that. It's my fault, I should press it more than going to the doctor... when I realized... I was sick. Come, we assume, most of the time. And we that with God too. So if we can not assume that God does not care, we can not assume that God cares. Yes, that's right Carl. Everyone, including myself, need accept what is true. For example, I care about you all. And I love them both. And where if that love is not God And so are you. If I learned anything in Basic training is... distinguish between... good and bad people.

Following equation 4X5X8 = - Can I help? - Yes, I'm Elizabeth Thatcher. - Miss Thatcher? Comes two days late. - Yes You see were robbed on the way and left stranded there for three bandits. We had to come walking. The Montclair guard, was brave to bring me all the way here. Guard, do you mind if I talk with Ms. Thatcher in private? Miss Stanton, could join us, please? Following equation 7x3x6 = Miss Thatcher regret the hard journey you have had. - Abigail Stanton. - Nice to meet you. We are the owners of the bar. Too young to be a teacher. I realize that perhaps I am not what they expected. but to be honest I did not expect that the city was so empty. Or that the school I was in a bar. A house would be more appropriate if it had not been burned. Miss Thatcher, the super Mayor Higgins, told what happened here, right? Tell me what? Three months ago there was a terrible mine explosion and several... men lost their lives... and many of these children lost their parents. Yes, I lost my husband. We asked Mr. Higgins send us your best teacher. And not recede before the challenges of Coal Valley. The teaching position is a of the few things in the whole... this city... it is not company-owned Coal. The mothers, all of us we sustain. And we will not let the company is responsible... education... our children. So if you accept this work, we pay their wages. Miss Thatcher, for Please understand something... We are all proud of the work our husbands and children... made... in the coal mine, but we knew it was a risk... ... in order to grow the nation, but for many women... in the city... our children is all we have left. And we want your dreams guide you in what... and... should be done, although That means leaving this... people... behind. Therefore, its teacher should be reckless... to help them... fulfill these dreams. I believe in the same ideals, ma'am. We do not want just taught to read and... writing... but because fight for their future. To put it kindly, Is enough... woman to do..., Miss Thatcher? Miss Thatcher. I know I speak for all in saying we are most grateful... for having taught... our children this year. Thank you. Children, do you I can have your attention? My name is Elizabeth and Thatcher be happy to be your new teacher, I hope you never fear to get closer to me with questions. My first rule in my classroom is there will never be bad questions. Miss? Thatcher, I can talk to you? - Ready? - Sorry for children. The men we stolen just out of town. So if you'll excuse me I have money to recover. - It's three against one. - I like those odds. Edward, I do not care about money, and I can live without a compass. I know, but it is my duty to recuperrtelo. Like yours teach these children. If you remember, as I read more than you, and some... Mounties... in the end settling down. Excuse me again children, be right back. Edward, Edward! I had no time to tell you... Just wanted to say... please come back safe.
