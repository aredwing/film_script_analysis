No, I just replaced them. -Excuse me. -Yeah. No, it can't be. You... you seem way to young. -You look identical to someone... -Look, I gotta go. -Sorry. -Sure, yeah, sorry. Yes, we talked about this two weeks ago. No, I need an answer quicker than that. Hold on. Hello. I got to call you back. I don't care... I don't care what the Bishop thinks. Look, father, I'll raise the money myself in I have to. I'll rob a bank if necessary. No, I won't rob a bank. Joe, wait. Come here. What baby? Those kids are dying of hunger, father. They can't wait for your meeting. Is this all we've got? No, we got more. But not what you wanted. No, I'm right here. What point? What are you doing. I don't care what religion those people are. Those kids are dying of hunger. They need food. Not a cross. No, no, the point is we need to help them. That's the point. Ok, look. Have your meeting. Analyze whatever you need to analyze. I'm going forward with or without your blessing. We need more shoes. Hello. Yeah. So how much they need? That's some kind of dough. Hi, grandpa. Hi Emmett. Sorry, I'm late. -Hello, Dave. -Hey, pops. Hey, I got a great weekend planned. Ok. I'll take us to the game. Ok. And whatever else you want to do. Ok, we'll go to the batting cages. Sounds like fun. Grab your stuff. Let's go. Do want to here on Sunday? -I'll call you. -Ok. Have a good weekend, Emmett. Ok, bye, Dad. See you. You looking for me? Yeah. I'm sorry... I didn't mean to... I mean... how you doing? My name's Jimmy Anderson. -there's something I'd like to show you. Reporter took these photos. And... that man saved my life in Vietnam. But I never found out who he was. I mean, he just came out of the blue and then he just left. I never saw him again. He looks identical to you. -except that he should be like 40 something now. I mean, the resemblance is amazing. That's what puzzled. I'm thinking maybe this is someone who could have been related to you? Why do you want to find this man? Why? Yes. To find out what his name is. To thank him. Buy him a beer. Well, even if you never find him, I'm sure the thought counts. I got to go. Sorry. Look, this is the closest I've ever gotten to really finding this man. I can't help you right now. Well, that's ok. I mean, we can meet tomorrow or some other time. I just want to pick your brain. Maybe we can put two and two together. I think you're looking in the wrong places. What do you mean? Is the man in the pictures what you're really looking for? Of course. Who else? I don't know. That's why I'm asking. Look, I'm sorry. I really have to go. Look, I'd really to have a talk with you some other time. Some other time. Where can I find you? Around here. Just ask for me. Well, what's your name? Hey, Joe. Father, I'm going to go home now. There are still some people over there in the church. So I didn't lock it. Anything else you need before I go? No thanks. Ok. Good night. Good night. Why did you hide? I don't know. It was a reaction. Catherine, look at me. No. No what? What you're thinking. What I'm thinking. You have a husband, and I have a church. It's your husband. What is he doing here? I do want to see him. But I have to answer the door. I can't see right now. I just can't. May I help you? Father Michael, I guess you remember me. I'm Catherine's husband. Yes, of course. I'll never forget anybody I marry. I'd like to have a talk with you. I'm in the middle of something right now. Can you come back tomorrow? Tomorrow's going to be difficult. I only need a few minutes. Ok. Come in. Thanks. I normally don't smoke. You're probably surprised to see me, father. I think my wife is seeing someone. What makes you think that? I... I can't pinpoint it. I don't have any proof. It's a gut feeling. I hardly ever see her anymore. Well, you can't just go on gut feeling alone. You can tell those things. The way she dresses. It's the way she looks at me. It's not one specific thing. It's just a combination of a lot of little things. I try talking to her. How do you talk about these things. It's difficult. So how can I help you? I figured if she were to have told anyone, she would have told you during confession. Confessions are confidential. You know, I was hoping you could help me out. Maybe you noticed something or she said something. I mean, we've got a kid. I'm just trying to keep it together. My god. What's going on here? It's not what you think. I swear. No, no, no, we'll just all sit down. We'll work... You son of... No. Father. Father, I'm so sorry. No, don't shoot. Shut up! Daddy, no. Just give me the gun, nothing happened between us. Just give me your gun. How could you do this? Happy birthday. Hello, may I help you? Yeah, I need a room. For how many night? I don't know. It's a tall guy, blond hair. He told me I could find him here. I have a picture right here. That's the man I'm looking for. Look I don't think I know him. Ok? He was here a couple nights ago. Look Father Michael might know him. But he's saying mass right now. I don't know him. Yeah, I think he must. Let me give you my address. Just ask the priest to give it to him, ok? Thanks. last night if you saw bright lights, unusual colors, and odd shapes flying over the Phoenix sky, you weren't the only one. Now what that something was is in question. Yes? Sorry, to bother you, Father. But they've been trying to get you from the office. Your phone seems to be off the hook. What time is it? It's 2 in the afternoon. That looks good. I'll tell you, everything that I've seen so far looks great. I'm going through your chart. I've looked at your labs. I've looked at your x-rays. All your results turned out to be normal. Physically I think you're in great shape. But this time I think we need to take it a step further and get a psychological evaluation. What are you suggesting? Is something mental... No, I'm not saying it's mental. What I'm saying at this point we need to have you see a psychiatrist to evaluate the other aspects so I can put all this stuff together. I saw a dream, which made me afraid. And the thoughts upon my bed and the visions of my head trouble me. Visions of my head trouble me. Visions of my head trouble me. Daniel 4:5. Daniel 4:5. 4, 5, 4, 5. Daniel, Daniel, Daniel. I saw a dream, which made me afraid. And the thoughts upon my bed and the visions of my head trouble me. Daniel. Hi. I think someone was looking for you. He showed me some pictures. And I think it's you. Anyway, he told me to give you this address. Ok. He didn't have blue eyes. Why are you crying? Because I don't like math. Math. I'll tell you a secret. I have a PhD in chemistry, and I still count on my fingers. But I don't want to be a PhD. What do you want to be? A chef. I see. Why aren't you at work? My daddy's at work right now. Well, about a year ago on a very beautiful spring day I was going to work just like every other day. And I thought what if I just kept going. So I took off my tie. And I just drove and drove and drove. Did your boss get mad at you? No. Well, a little bit. George, it's me, Jimmy. I'm far, real far. Well, but I quit. No, I'm not kidding. What family? I have no family. Actually you gave me an idea. I should start one now that I'm divorcing the company. Crazy? Well, you know, sometimes you just have to do what you really want. So long, George. My daddy doesn't like his boss. Maybe I should tell him to do the same thing. Come on, let's go. Father Daniel, good to see you. Long way, Michael. You made it. It was a good drive. It was good. Just a little hard to find. Finding me can be difficult. I'm happy you're here, Michael. Have a seat. Father, the reason I came here today is because I want to talk to you... I haven't been a priest for what? 10 years. You don't need to call me father. Well, a priest is always a priest. You sounded preoccupied on the phone. What's going on? About a year ago or so I started to get these headaches. At the beginning I thought it was stress. Didn't think much of it. But after a while they became more intense, more painful. And lately, I started to hear sounds. What kind of sounds? They're not sounds that I can identify. They're not voices either. They're sounds that I've never heard before. I want to show you something. A couple of days ago somebody left this in my house. I don't know how or why. Do you know what this is? It's an Egyptian cross. It's called Ankh. It represents the key to hidden mysteries, a key to the kingdom of the dead and eternal life. I had seven dreams where I see that across again and again. I remember each one, seven times. Does anyone else know about all of this? No. I saw a doctor, but I didn't tell him I hear things. You said you found it a couple of nights ago. It was March 13. That's right. Your birthday. You remember my birthday. I remember a lot of people's birthdays. What's your gut feeling telling you? What do you think is happening? If someone was telling me something like this, I would think that person is delusional, maybe schizophrenic. Do I think I'm crazy? No. Normal? What's normal? How can I rationally explain this drawing that appears in my dreams. How can anyone know what's inside my head? It's just not real. Do you know I was an atheist when I was younger? No. I'll believe it when I see it was my motto. Basically, I didn't believe in anything. What changed you? I became curious. Our eyes are great to read a book or drive, watch a movie. But can we really trust our senses to determine what's real and what's not. For instance, radio waves, frequencies, we can't see them or touch them. But they're here. What else is around us that we can't see. Lucia. Lucia. Lucia. 'Why did you come to me? I haven't seen you for years. You spent your life researching miracles. And you were involved in exorcisms. Plus, you've been my mentor. Who else can I trust? No that's not it. There's something else. I was reading a passage in the Bible. And your name appeared before me. When was the last time you had this experience? Last night. Does it come slowly? Do you get any warning before it happens? No, it just happens without any warning. The drawing is the clue. Someone is trying to make contact with you. You're not suggesting I'm possessed by... A demon? No, no, no, no. This is not about exorcism. This is different. Can you spend the night here? Yes. I can. I guess I can show you this now. Right here, Michael. Now, who could that be? Excuse me. It's my neighbor from across the street. I need to move my car. I'll be right back. He's in a coma. When is he going to recover? It's to early to tell. I'm sorry. Someone is trying to make contact with you. The drawing is the clue. Why did you come to me? I haven't seen for years. A. A 115. A 115 A. Bible. Bible. Bible. Bible. A. A. A. Acts. I was in the city of Joppa praying. And in a trance I saw a vision. A certain vessel descend... a vessel, a certain vessel descend as it had been a great sheet let down by heaven by four corners. And it came even to me... even to me... even to me. Whether it's true or not, it's not the issue. The rumor of the affair with a married woman is very real. It's the rumor that's the problem, Father. Not truth or lies. People ask questions and wonder and the rumor grows. And this is hurting our church. Think about it. Another city, a new start. I think that would be a good way, we think, to kill the rumor. God bless you, Father. In the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy spirit. Amen. Go ahead. Do You ever wonder what you looked like before you were born? I don't expect an answer, Father. Something to think about. If I told you, what would be the point? If I interfere, what would the consequences be. If you interfere what? I do forgive you. Wait. Who's there? Joe, what is it? Father, this is blood? Have You told anybody else about this? No. Don't you think we should call the police? The police? We could call the police. Along with the police, the media will come... meaning publicity, most likely bad publicity. On the other hand, we're responsible for many people that count on us. So we have to put everything on a scale. We have to figure out which decision affects the least number of people. That's the question, Joe. If I interfere, what would the consequences be? Something to think about. But I do forgive you. We've been getting complaints from some of your parishioners. Are you aware of that? The bishop is not happy with your approach, your... what's the word? Unorthodox. Unorthodox, your unorthodox approach to the priesthood. And we've had this conversation, several times, Father Michael. And yet, you seem to insist on going you way rather than the church's way. Aren't you going to say anything? Father? Father. Father. Michael. If you went to solve the mystery of your thoughts, you have to look into the scriptures. You have to look into scripture that predate the Bible. Today, we call them aliens. You know, 2,000... 3,000 years ago, they call them angels. One of the things that we have found is that along with the sightings, there is an encounter with someone that appears to be human, normal person. Sometimes it's a man. Sometimes it's a woman. But there's always an encounter. You made it. Why did you come to Phoenix? I'm just passing through. Maybe I'll go north or south or just flip a coin before I go. That's how I like to travel. I still don't know what I can do for you? I understand that some people may look alike. But for many years, I have been having this feeling that someone follows me. And then I have these dreams where the person who follows me tells me something. I can never recall what he says. But I remember his face. It's the soldiers face. It's... it's your face. I thought maybe... you probably think I'm nuts. I don't know why I asked you to come. I guess I was looking for... I don't know. A miracle. Maybe this is just a waste of time. Maybe not. Are you oke? You look like you're in pain. I'm fine. Don't worry. So where are we going? Let's just go for a ride. Hello. Yes. Father, I just wanted to apologize. I don't know what came over me that night. I just... I'm very sorry. That's Ok, Dave. I've already forgiven you. Father, that night, before I came to your house, something crazy... before I came to your house, I saw those lights. They flew right over me. What lights? What are you talking about? Lights, they flew over Phoenix. It's been in the news, the papers everywhere. I guess I haven't been paying attention. I haven't told this to anyone, but... There was something about those lights. It's just nuts, Father, But I felt strange. Felt I needed to go to your house. Ok, stop right here. What do you see there? What do you see? I don't see anything. Am I supposed to look for something? The right path. The right path to what? Whatever it is you're looking for. What are you talking about? You have two choices, Jimmy. You can take the path to the left. Or you can take the path to the right. Either way, you're going to end up someplace different. What? Left or right, Jimmy. You're not really serious, are you? Do I look like I'm joking? Ok, I don't what kind of game this is, but I'll play. Left... that's the road I'm taking. Where you going? I'm leaving, Jimmy. We're in the middle of nowhere. What do you mean you're leaving? Jump in. Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait, wait, what are you nuts or something. Let's go grab a six pack and forget about all this crazy stuff. Let me see that coin. Now listen to me, Jimmy. What you see there is not a fork in the road. That's the rest of your life. What are you saying? Don't leave it to chance, Jimmy. You need to trust your instincts on this one, because this is not your second chance. It's your last. Wait, wait, wait. Time out. What's going on here? Who the hell are you, man? Let the past be the past, Jimmy. Go and make your decision. No, no, stop it. No? Stop. No is not an answer. I can't spend the afternoon with you. I have to go back to work. We don't spend any time together. 10 years of hell, now you want to spend time together. Where are you going? Nowhere. Just please take me back. See, I used to work for a big oil company. But one day I just quit. I had an idea for an alternative fuel. And you could make in your own backyard out of practically anything. They didn't like that. I'm actually still working on it. I'm so close. Sometimes I think it's just a dream. Are you drunk? Are you drunk? You're drunk. Let's go. You could have killed me. -It was an accident. -You could have killed me. Back off. He's nothing. He's drunk. He's nothing. Please, let's just go. He could have killed me. It was an accident. Nothing happened. Why are you defending him? Defend me. Let's go. Defend me. You're acting irrational. Defend me. Stop. -Jimmy? -Sabrina? How long has it been? 25 years. You know, I've never stopped looking for you. Dad, are you sleeping? No. Mom, no, nothing. I didn't realize how late it was. Yeah, yeah. I'm coming to visit soon, Mom. I miss you too. Her son has disappeared. The police have been looking for him since last night. They... they don't know what happened yet. I... I don't know what we can do. Feathers, feathers, circles, desert, the desert. No, no, no. Sky, desert clouds. Feathers, feathers, feathers. Wire fence, fence, fence. Wire fence. Feathers, feathers. feathers. Feathers with triangles, triangles. See the triangles. The doctor said that you're ready to go home. And we're going to go ahead and send your results to your primary care physician. Tomorrow you're going to need to give them a call... I'm going mad. I'm sorry. I'm really sorry. You ever wonder what you looked like before you were born? If I told you, what would be the point? So you had a vision of where the kid was. That's the truth. We feel it's in the best interests of the church and yourself if you took some time off... a year, maybe two. There's a mission in Chicago that could use your help. Why Chicago? Because it's cold. Cold weather's good for thinking. It's just a matter of time until someone... because there's always someone... who will suggest that maybe you had something to do with the kid's disappearance. I mean, there are already rumors... There are already rumors that you are a psychic or a medium. Or a charlatan. Let's see if we understand each other, you have become a liability to the church. Lucia. Father, father, are you there? Father, father. Dad, come to me. Mommy, are you hiding from me? Am not sure, is this real? What is it. Daddy, mommy. Father, mother. Where are you hiding from me? Why do you hide from me? Is this real? Real? What do you mean, what do I want? Is this real? Fine. I'm not sure now. What am I supposed to do. I can see. I can see. I can feel it. I remember it. I remember the road. I was here. I was here. I remember this road. I was right here. Are you there. I was here. I remember. Something happened. Where are you, mommy? Waiting for you. Yo, hey, mister, are you... Yeah, hi. Got a problem. I found guy in a car. He's not breathing. I think he's dead. Look deep inside yourself. Seek. Ask questions. Go deeper. Go deeper. Keep going. Don't be afraid. Your fear. Face your fear. Go beyond your fear. Go beyond your fear. Keep going. Look beyond them, Micheal. Beyond them. Don't give up now. Past them. Past them. Look beyond that, Michael. Beyond that. Deeper, Michael. It's more. It's more. Don't look there. Keep going. Deeper, Michael. Don't give up now. Follow me. Don't be afraid, Michael. You are here, Michael. Good. Keep going. Go in, Michael. What do you see? What do you see, Michael? What do you see? Let me be inside you. Good, good. Do you know where you are? It's 1960. It's summer. Something happened that summer. Something extraordinary. It completely changed my life. I was sitting at a bench in a park near my church. A stranger came up and sat next to me. I didn't mind. I could use someone to talk to. I was drinking back then, especially that day. I just gave the funeral mass of a little girl. It's hard when a child dies. Hard to understand. Everything you say to the parents sounds so hollow, so empty. You say she's in a better place. But this is the better place with them. Maybe there's no such thing as death. Maybe dying is just getting up and going into another room. You know why I come here? This will probably sound silly to you, but I had a dream. I was in a park like this one. Suddenly someone walked up to me, a young man, 32, no more. I couldn't see his face clearly. But he looked like Jesus. He felt like Jesus. He was so vivid, so real. Then I woke up. I've been coming here ever since. We became friends. He visited me several times. We talked about everything. He was the most brilliant person I've ever met in my life. I was completely intrigued. Who was he? Where was he from? I've know you for a while now. But I don't know anything about you. Who are you? What do you do? Where are you from? Is that important to you? To know? Yes. What I'm going to show you will be hard to understand. Just try to remain calm. Don't be afraid. I can't describe what happened to me. There are no words. No way to explain it. I had a million questions. And then he took me to the beginning of all. He simply said, the seeker shall not stop until he finds. When he finds, he will become troubled. When he becomes troubled, he will be astonished. And then he will reign over all. Two days later, he came back. There's a couple who goes to your church. They just came over from Italy about a year ago. Yes, Antonio and Maria Corino. I... I know them well. And the wife, she's having trouble having kids. Yes. It's been very painful for them. They've tried everything. They've seen several doctors. There's nothing they could do. She can't have a child. She will have a child, a boy. They'll call him Michael. I want you to look after him. That's your mission. March 13, 1997, the day of his 36th birthday, he's going to go through a transformation. It will be difficult. He'll rediscover himself. And finally he'll be ready to take on his mission. What am I supposed to do? Guide him. Teach him well. A couple of days after his birthday in '97, he's going to come to see you, ask some questions. Fate is going to play some games on both of you. Lift your arm. I can't. It's paralyzed. Lift it. All faith, he said, all beliefs are merely roads that will ultimately lead to the same conclusion. When your faith is not in men, not in words, miracles will happen, he said. Healing will happen. Go east on Rocks Springs about the four miles and you'II... I'm ok. Thank you. Don't ask me what happened. This guy's out of his car and just walked over to me. He seems to be ok. I don't have a clue. He visited me seven more times during a period of three years. Everything you'll find in this box is about what he revealed. You have been chosen to help to prepare the way for what's coming. There are many others like you. You're not alone. You are to meet the need wherever necessary. Everybody, Michael, is looking for meaning, for answers. But not everyone is ready yet. The secret would tear them apart. But when they are ready, that day, everything as you know it will collapse. All injustice, all the hatred, all the lies, and all your conflicts will vanish. That day, everyone will be free. Hello, this message is for Father Michael. My name is Susanna McClure. I'm investigating an event that occurred in Phoenix in March 1997. Some time ago someone brought us a box with some information, some materials. We believe that this relates to you and also to the events in Phoenix back in '97. I'm very interested in meeting you and talking about this at your convenience. Please call me 305-555-3490.
