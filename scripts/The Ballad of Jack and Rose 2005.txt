Yeah I ain't gonna take none of your Foolin' around I ain't gonna take none of your Puttin' me down I put a spell on you - I see a rabbit. - Where? Up there. One that's got big, droopy ears. That's a shoe. That's a shoe. - It's more of a... It's a boot. A lace-up boot. - It's a boot, like your boot. Now what is it? I put a spell on you Cos you're mine You better stop the thing that you're doin' I said watch out I ain't lyin. Yeah I ain't gonna take none of your Foolin' around Ain't gonna take none of your Puttin' me down I put a spell on you Cos you're mine Oh, you're mine They're all moving into these houses, Rosie. A whole nation. A whole fucking world of plastic houses. It's like a rash. It's eating up this island like a case of bad acne. In 30 years, there won't be anything left that isn't suburbia... ...or the ghettos. Cos they all want to live in places with people exactly like themselves. They have their own police forces, some of them, to keep their greedy little children safe. And they have the vanity to call this place a community. Look at this crap! That's not a house. It's a thing to keep the TV dry. I wish we had a TV. No, you don't. I swear, I solemnly believe that humanity is now officially descending the ladder of evolution. In a thousand years, human beings will be the size of gerbils and they'll have one thought a year... ...in December. They'll think about what they want for Christmas. Decline and rot, my angel, that's the way of the world... ...except for you. You're exempt. Remember that. Jack Slavin for Marty Rance. Hey, Marty. Me again. That's government land that you're eating into. 50 yards of nature preserve. That is a wetland, as I'm sure you know. You can call the cops if you want to. I'll call them myself. I look forward to seeing the outcome. We needed a doorstop. What are you thinking about? I'm going to plant the bell flowers in front of the house today. At least leave me a place to walk. - You're getting freckles. - I always had those. No, there's nothin' you can send me My own true love There's nothing I'm wishin' to be ownin' Just carry yourself back to me unspoiled From across that lonesome ocean Oh, but I just thought you might want something fine Made of silver or of golden Either from the mountains of Madrid Or from the coast of Barcelona If I had the stars of the darkest night And the diamonds from the deepest ocean I'd forsake them all for your sweet kiss For that's all I'm wishin' to be ownin' Rosie, Rosie. That's a sweet little bridge, but I wouldn't want to drive across it. Well, seeing as we never go anywhere... You still don't understand weight-stress ratios. I understand them enough. - Enough for what? - Everyday needs. The Latin name for "buttercup" will only get you so far. Let me write that again. One more time... ...with feeling! What is the Latin name for "buttercup"? Ranunculus Bulbosus. What? I'm glad I got to know you for such a long time. Don't say stuff like that. - I have to face up to it. - Shut up, OK? Do you not think we should get somebody in to help? Who, a maid? Don't go off, Rosie. Go away. What is it? You're going to leave me soon. You're the one that's going to leave soon. You're getting too big for me. Look at the size of that hand. No, you're going to die. It's just the way it is. I mean, this thing may be... pumping away for some while to come. When you die, I'm going to die. - What on earth are you talking about? - I am. What are you going to die of? When you go, I'm going. If you die, there's no point to my life. Tough luck. Don't you ever say that again. Do you hear me? You never say that again. Tell me a story. Come on. Once... there was a girl... and she lived in a little tiny house. And one day an ox came by. And the girl was so polite, she said, "Ox, would you care to join me for tea?" The ox wasn't used to being spoken to very much. He was flattered. He said, "Thank you, yes. " And he proceeded to put his nose through the door. His nose had a big ring in it. The girl pulled as hard as she could on the ring to try to get the ox through the door. The ox pushed and pushed. The girl pulled and pulled. Cracks started to appear around the walls. Then the ox gave one great almighty push. The whole house collapsed around them. So she climbed up on the ox's back and they rode away together. In the course of time, they were married. Let me look at you. I'm never going to leave you, you know. I have to go to town tonight, Rosie. There's some stuff I've got to do there. I may not be back until the morning. - Will you be all right? - Yeah. - I'll see you later, Rosie. - OK. Seen a shooting star tonight And I thought of you You were trying to break into another world A world I never knew I always kind of wondered If you ever made it through Seen a shooting star tonight And I thought of you Seen a shooting star tonight And I thought of me If I was still the same If I ever became what you wanted me to be Did I miss the mark Or overstep the line That only you could see? Seen a shooting star tonight And I thought of me - Is she here? - She's downstairs. You got thinner. Hi, by the way. I was thinking maybe you'd come live with me. - What? - You heard. You've never even invited me out there. - You like me that much, huh? - Yep. What about my kids? Well, that goes without saying. What about Rose? - Have you thought this through? - Through? I've thought about it, but I'm not clairvoyant. - You know what I mean, Jack. - Come live with me. Quit your job. Quit your jobs. I can make life easier for you. Just to prove that... I'm in earnest... Call that an early-retirement package. Er... It's not coming out right, is it? No. I'm sorry. Look, come live with me. Give it a try. I'll take care of you or you take care of me. Whatever. My kid needs a woman around the place and... so do I. I need you. How's that? What are you thinking? I'm wondering if you're crazy or not. That's a waste of time, honey. My poor tree house. We can rebuild it. That's not a problem. Do you really use it any more? It's my house. - Rose... - Yes? There's some people coming that I've invited. Guests. - Guests? - People... just come to stay for a while. It's an experiment. OK? New chapter. Hey! Welcome, strangers. - I see you er... - Yeah. A couple of things. So glad to finally meet you, Rose. - I'm Jack. - Yeah, I'm Thaddius. Thaddius. Right. You must be Rodney. Welcome. These are my boys. That's Thaddius... Rodney... This is Rose. Oh, I'm Kathleen. Wow! Does anybody else live out here? Er... used to be a commune. There was 60 people living here, give or take, at one time. Engineers, farmers, carpenters, a couple of scientists... We were trying to... Well, it wasn't what you see in the movies. We weren't painting ourselves orange and shaking tambourines and whatever else they got up to then. We were trying to... rebuild society on a small scale. We were trying to figure out a way people could live without destroying the planet, with virtually no waste or private property and... I'll take that. It was an experiment. It looks like it didn't go too well. - No, we learnt some stuff. - Watch it. - This is it. - Oh, Jack... Just put all your stuff down there for now. Bring the rest in later on. Where do you really live? In my aunt's basement. How long are you going to stay here? Not very long, personally, but I have a feeling that my mother will be embedded here for quite some time. You get a lot of postcards. My mother used to send them. - Uh-huh. - She left when I was five. She might be coming back. - Oh, dear. - Rose? Would you like to help me set the table? I'm just going to make some cheese sandwiches. - No, no... - Oh, that's cooked food for the chickens and that's raw food for the compost and the big one... metal and plastic, paper. - You'll get the hang of it. - Yeah. OK. Any questions about the house, ask Rose. One of you can sleep in here for the time being, and the other one's on the couch until we get one of the outbuildings fixed up. - That's fine. - Is that all right with you? - Mm-hm. - It's so quiet in here. It's like the inside of a can. Hey, where's the TV? No TV. Are you working at the moment, Rodney? I've been studying to be a women's hairdresser. What brought you to that? Erm... I always wanted to be a barber, but men don't get enough pleasure out of their hair. Did you do er...? Kathleen. - Yeah. Her hair? - No, I didn't do Kathy's hair. My mother likes to think of herself as being 16 years old. - Oh, Rodney! - I'm sure if I cut her hair off, she would have a breakdown of some kind. How do you make your money? I inherited the family business when my father died, so I sold it. - Oh. So you're loaded? - I don't think you need to worry about that. - Mom said you were an engineer. - That's what I studied. - Er... alternative energy. - You got your degree in England? Scotland, but I've been an American since 1972. Naturalised citizen, God help me. Why did you do it, then? Because I fell in love with this country, or... what I thought it was going to become. You've got one more year of school left, is that right? - Yeah, I guess so. - I was expelled in the last year of high school. Why? For defecating in the thirteenth hole of the school golf course. - Your school had a golf course? - He's doing real well in school. - Is that for me? - Yeah, sweetie. It's a cheese sandwich. I haven't seen one like that since 1953. - I'll be right back. - OK. Sorry. Rose... Don't make me bloody well chase after you! They're not guests. They're moving in! They're guests, until we see. Just see how it works out. - They brought everything! - Everything? They brought their lamps! I've got to admit, those lamps were shocking. Look, it's just an experiment, Rosie. Let's just try it for a while to see how it works out. God forbid, you might even end up wanting them to stay! - You tricked me! - It was a spur-of-the-moment decision. She's so regular. Kathleen, her name is, by the way. That's the whole point. She'll take care of things. - I took care of things! - We took care of things. Now I'm sick. How long have you been lying to me? How could you not have told me? I didn't think you'd understand. I don't. Hey, little freak. Ever eaten a snake before? No. I know these kind of woods. You got copperheads in there, don't you? There's a few that live under a dead tree in the woods. Show me where the tree is. I used to trap snakes for this evangelist. - What did he do with them? - Put on a show. Said he had the power of God cos he didn't get bitten. Did he have the power of God? He died of a snakebite. There. So does your dad know about this place? Maybe. Does he know everything about you? Wild thing. I'll give you a bedtime story you won't forget. - What are you doing? - I want you to do it to me. - Huh! Oh, my God. - I never did it before. Not even partly. And erm... what made you select tonight for your initiation? Cos I have to do it right away. Er, my brother is out at the moment... probably doing something along these lines, so if you want to take a seat in his room I'm sure he'll be happy to oblige. I don't like him. That's funny. I don't like him, either. Look, it's not funny. OK? This is tragic. It's... It's not exactly tragic. It's er... it's ridiculous. OK? No. OK, no, look. Look, wait. I wasn't aware that, on top of being trapped in retro world due to my mother's saviour complex, I myself was to become a sort of sex toy... ...for my angelic, possibly disturbed, certainly odd new sister. OK? Let's... Let's not forget that part. Huh! Who are you people? - But I like you. - Christ... Just... Just... I'm just er... I'm not ready to unpeel my nylon at this particular point in time. Not for anybody. It's nothing personal. Hey... I got an idea. It's... It's kind of a compromise. Do you mind if it's radical? I put a spell on you Cos you're mine You'd better stop the things you do I ain't lyin. No I ain't lyin. You know I can't stand it Your running around You know better, Daddy I can't stand it cos you put me down Yeah, yeah I put a spell on you Because you're mine You're mine Oh, yeah I love you, I love you I love you I love you anyhow And I don't care if you don't want me I'm yours right now Jesus Christ! Come on. Oh, God... Are you out of your fucking mind? Rodney did it for me. I was referring to the loaded gun. You're a bloody little hooligan. What are you doing? Look what he did to you. Do you love me? Is she all right? Good night, my little dove. What was Rose's mother like? What was your wife like? Just about the opposite of you. - What does that mean? - Well, you know. You. Imagine the opposite of you. Thin hair, dark eyes, big tits? - Go a little deeper. - Rich? She was inscrutable, dreamy, capricious, deceitful and totally selfish. Oh. So it was a compliment. Everything from me to you is a compliment, no matter what it sounds like. - That's a mean game. - Come here and I'll show you a mean game. - Has Rose ever talked to a psychologist? - Like your son, maybe? The psychology of hair? Jesus! No, I'm just... I'm wondering. - Is she still in school? - I took her out when she was 11. How could you not send her to school? Don't believe in factory farming. I teach her here. Well, Rose is the way you made her. What are you getting at, Kathleen? Well, you raised her, so she couldn't love anybody else. She's not used to having anybody around. We come along and she gets a little upset. What are you going to do when it's time for her to get a job? Listen, there are wonderful schools for children with problems. My cousin Vera... Shut your bloody mouth! Did you hear that? There's nothing wrong with Rose. - If you don't think things will work out here, fine. - I don't. I... Jack, I didn't mean it that way. I'm just... Look, it's not, you know, that easy for me. I mean, I just, you know, I... I'm sorry, OK? I'm not judging you. It's just like, you know, we see each other... I'm not, you know. We see each other for four months, you don't tell her about me and I'm supposed to move in here. I don't... - What? - I don't... I don't understand. Understanding, whatever the hell that means, doesn't make a blind bit of difference. Look, believe me, Kathleen, I've... ...I've made a mess of a lot of things in my life. I don't have time to pay for them. So I'm just trying to live a different way now. - I'm sorry. - I'm sorry. That's what I need you for. Are you equal to it or not? - Yeah. - Good. OK. I'm going to take really good care of you. OK? I believe it. Careful. I'm a sick man. Good morning, Rose. - How are you feeling today? - Fine. Breakfast in a minute, Rodney. Don't look so droopy. Thaddius! Thaddius! Morning, Rodney. Interesting job on Rose last night. - Thank you. - I think it looks great, honey. I didn't mean for it to be so explosive. You sure scared us last night, Rose. You know, you shouldn't walk around with guns, even when you're kidding. - I wasn't kidding. - Excuse me? What are you wearing? Huh? Well, that's half the day's electricity gone! Oh, no food again. Thank God! You've already lost 16lb, honey. Let's just keep it up. - Thaddius! Breakfast. - Hey... Now! I love my life. Excuse me. - What are you doing today? - I don't know. Maybe I'll go find a job mowing some other rich people's lawns. Are there any other people on this island, or what? Soon you won't be able to take a piss without 15 people clapping. May I be excused? Turn the light on, at least. You'll ruin your eyes always reading in the dark. You know, Thaddius used to work in a garage. I was just thinking, you know, it's amazing your skin stayed so clear after working in that grime for so long. - Pancake, Rose? - Sure. - What are you on about? - He's gorgeous. He probably already has a date lined up for tonight. Right, Thaddius? He has been known to date farm animals under extreme duress. Rodney, are you ever going to take that jacket off so I can wash it? - Yeah, Linus, maybe you'd get a date too. - Hey... Can I come with you to look for your job? You're not going anywhere. You've got work to do. And you can start by putting some clothes on. I see that I'm on toilet duty again today. - It's a rotating schedule. - Mm. - Another man, another programme. - Would you please shut your mouth? If this one ever gives you anything, I'd like a commission. Well, what do you know? You're interested in make-up. Oh, don't worry about it. Let me help you. Do you want to sit down? You're such a pretty girl, you should learn how to use it. I was only a couple of years older than you... ...when I had Rodney. It's hard to believe. You seem like a little girl. Do you want to be my dad's wife? Er... Well, one step at a time. With your dad's heart as weak as it is, I'm just trying to keep him alive. It would help if he ate a little meat occasionally. This... you need to learn to do without a mirror. Mm. Do you ever want to have kids some day? Do you want to work? Have a career? Do you ever want to leave the island? - Aah! - Why do you always wear that jacket? - Just scrub your tub, Miss Muffet. - You know what? It's too hot, so take it off. - You're all sweaty. I'm going to get that off you! - Help, help! No! That's not funny! You're a sadist. - You're a sadist! Stop it! - Jesse? Jesse! Come here, boy! Hey! What happened to you? Mom's got me cleaning the latrines. - Who's Mom? - Ask Jack. - You've brought everything? - Yep. That's great. Thanks. Hi. - Hi. - I'm Kathleen. - I deliver flowers for Rose every now and then. - Oh. - Well, you must have a name. - Gray. That's a nice name. Rose certainly is a passionate gardener. Er, yes, she's... got the touch. Yeah. It's probably good for her, too. All right. Well, go on with your day. It's nice to meet you. If you want any lemonade, I've got some in the kitchen. OK. Hi. I didn't see you there. - Could you do me a favour? - Sure, what? Could you teach me how to kiss? - What? - Please. What happened to you? You used to be so shy. I just have to. You don't want to do that with me. Why? Well, because your first kiss is supposed to be romantic... ...and, like, an accident. It's not like learning to swim. Well, can't we be romantic? I just... I don't think of you that way. Bye. Jesse! Come here, boy! I hope you don't think I'll be frying that up for supper! We're not really in much of a rush. It's OK. - Have you ever thought of suicide? - Yeah. But I'd like to do it myself, if you don't mind. I'm going to, when my dad dies. Is that a definite plan? Yeah. - Rodney! - Oh, she's with child. What's up? Ooh, watch the baby! This is... my friend Rose. Rose, Red Berry. Hello. It's nice to meet you. - Shall we? - Shall we, indeed. So I'm totally excited about seeing this commune. - How's the baby? - Heavy. It's going to be a big boy, just like you. - Hey, Gray. - Picked up your mail on the way in. - That old Ferenzie working you pretty hard? - Oh, not too bad. When is he going to make you manager? Er... I don't know. Maybe this summer. You must have been working there, what? Five years? Seven. That's too long to work by the hour. He's exploiting you. You know more about his business than he does. Well, he... owns the place. Thanks for the cheque. Could have used you here when it was up and running. Let me know when you're ready to build something of your own. We'll talk about a loan. Thanks, Jack, but... I... I wouldn't be able to do that. If you don't like your situation, change it. If you can't change it, leave it. It's your fucking life, man! I appreciate it. So see you on Saturday. Saturday, was it? - Yeah, thanks. - All right. Thanks, Gray. - On. - Yeah. Oh, my God! - This is awesome! What is this place? - It used to be an acid pad. Aha! I bet you guys do a lot of drugs. Hey, Rose, I wanna show you something, OK? Just stand back for a second. All right, are you ready? Oh, you had the baby. Fantastic. Hey, Rose, do you think I could see your palm? Wow! There is, like, hardly any lines in your hand. Oh, well. I guess some people just make themselves up as they go. I made up my name when I ran away. - You did? - Yeah, it just came to me. I was, like... I was standing outside of my mom's house and it was snowing and I just saw this little bush with these hard, shiny red berries on it just growing out of the snow, you know? Next time someone asked me what my name was, I just sort of said - "Red Berry" and it just kind of stuck. - Why did you run away? The important thing is, you have to forgive everybody. I forgave everybody after I left, even my mom and my brother. Oh, my goodness! That's perfect. We have a genuine and authentic, I'm sure, wedding-and-engagement-ring set. And I think you shall have them. Thank you. Red Berry, you don't seem the marrying type. Sorry. What? I'm definitely going to get married... ...to a big, fat man with a tiny wiener I can barely find. - Not you, Rodney. - Oh, thank God. He has to be really old, though, you know? So do you think that Kathleen is going to marry your dad? - She wants to. - Yeah. Yeah, Mom is a sucker for a sick man. My father was a diabetic. What was Thaddius's father like? He's er... He was just an idiot. I got a bee sting. Hey, Rosie. I didn't squash him. I was just out by the compost. Rodney, come here for a second. Let's have a look. Hold still. The only person you're hurting is yourself. I have a feeling I'll be living off guilt-burgers for a couple of weeks. - They're quite thinning. - All I want is to help you get down to a normal size. Ow! Shit! Easy. Bloody fuss. Why am I always the monster? Huh? Will you please tell me that? - It's a question only you can answer. - Oh, OK! I give up. Just eat, eat. Be disgusting. I'm signing off! What was that? Which God are you praying to? - Where have you been? - Up in the dome. What were you hiding in there for? Nothing. Are you OK? I'm fine. That was quite a fit that Kathleen had today. Sort of... surprising aspect to her personality. OK. Are you sure you're all right? You're acting a wee bit strangely. Tired. Who's the lucky guy? Well, sleep well. If there's something bothering you, we can just, you know, talk about it. OK. I'll be back, OK? Ow. Go ahead. - Ow... - Shh! Thanks. I'm just hoping that's your idea of a joke. New chapter. What's that? You've been ruined by that fucking scumbag! - Jack! Jack! - What? Oh, my God! I'll deal with this later on. Oh, God! Jack! - What? - Oh, my God! I just saw a copperhead. It went behind that dresser and disappeared. Probably wasn't a copperhead. Don't get hysterical. I know a fucking copperhead when I see one! - Oh, shit. Oh, God! - Right, everybody out of the room. Did I invite you to stay? Oh, God... Who were you planning on killing? I just wanted to scare her. Fuck... What are you hanging around the door for, faggot? - Hi! - Hi. - I'm Marty Rance. - Oh, hi. I'm Kathleen. - I'm looking for Jack Slavin. - Oh, he's in the house. There's a snake in there. Copperhead. That's why I'm... Er... Well, thanks. Hello. I'm Marty Rance. I'm developing that land over on the other side of the field. I'm just... making the rounds with the neighbours, trying to get acquainted. Looking for Jack Slavin. - I'm Jack Slavin. - Jack Slavin? Marty Rance. Great timing, Marty. How's your day so far? Oh, I'm just spending the afternoon kinda making the acquaintance, you know, just saying hi. - I know that. You just said that. - So, I did. How are thing going down at the site? You know how it is when you try to build something. You get setbacks. Trespassers, vandalism... It's hard to keep things tidy. I agree with you on that one. Trespassing and vandalism, - I can't abide by. Never could. - It's nice to hear you say that. The reason you can't build on a wetland, see, Marty, is that all that shite that goes into your sewer system over there will end up running into the island's water supply. The grounds too soft, quite apart from the wildlife that you're poisoning. That may not be a wetland any more. How did you work that out? I'm making an appeal. We have excellent sewers. - I'm sure you do. - Yeah. Er... You're bribing someone on the Corps of Engineers, is that it? I know you've got the Housing Board in your pocket already. You know, I really came here to try and make peace, to forget about anything either one of us might have done to upset the other, but by the same token, one of my men gave a pretty accurate description of a person who shot up our work site a little while ago. - Yeah, that was me. - Mm! Mm-hm. If you don't tell on me, I don't tell on you. Is that how it works? Here's the thing. You're slinging up houses on a wetland, right? I just want you to... take down one of them. Pick a house. I'll leave it up to you. - Of course, that's out of the question. - See you, Marty, if you don't destroy one of those houses, I'm going to have to kill you. I hope you're kidding, for your sake. You know, I tell you, from top to toe, I couldn't make any improvements. You're perfect. You too, my friend. I stuffed down most of the holes in the house, so we should be all right. I'd prefer it if you didn't smoke near the house, please. - Since when? - Since I fucking told you, you little rodent. - You're the boss. - That's right. I am the boss, and you're moving out. I don't want you sleeping in my house any more. You've got one more night... for your mother's sake. If it weren't for her, you'd be out on your arse tonight. I got you back. - Got me back for what? - For Kathleen. Now we're even. That's insane. You think I'm crazy too, now? We're tripping! - Who is? - Thaddius and I. Isn't that perfect? You all came. I was hoping. OK, let's learn a little American history. This is a genuine imitation acid pad that was built in 1971. - This is so cool! - It was built as a meeting house. Right. Sorry. See, there was an idea that all this stuff, all these images and sounds you'll be hearing, with a little luck, would break down the psyche of the people that were tripping. A person could smash past themselves and become part of the other people in the room. Am I getting this right, Jack? I'm just here as an observer. See, acid was just a tiny part of it. Jack wanted this commune to be a pure place... full of people who re-invented themselves, hardworking people who weren't greedy or petty or selfish, people who could actually share property because they weren't enslaved by the patterns they inherited from their moms and dads. It was going to be total freedom. Total freedom. See, Jack forgot how to believe in communal life a long time ago. How the hell would you know what I believed in, sweetheart? But anyway, seeing as we have guests, I thought we'd have a little... educational/nostalgic experience. Give up, boy! You want to kiss me? You rich fuck! You think you can buy yourself an instant family? Well, you can't buy me! Oh, my God! Shit! Oh, my God! What happened? Call an ambulance! Thaddius? Baby? Thaddius... What happened? Rose... Rose planted... Rose planted the snake to kill you. You crazy little bitch! Get out of here! Jack! I was bad. I'm sorry. You're not bad. You're innocent. Innocent people are just er... dangerous, I guess. I don't think I've even really met one before. You have to get out of here. OK? I'm going to stay with Red Berry. Please come with us. I just can't leave him. Well, if I'm not going to see you again, erm... ...you might as well know that you're pretty spectacular. Are you getting on or not? Here we go. Make secure, guys. Was that you who put the snake in the house? Look, I'm about that far away from my next heart attack, so, I mean, what the hell's going on with you? Have you nothing to say about all of this? Your problem is, you're scared. If you had any courage, we wouldn't be in this mess. - Who gives a shit what other people think? - What are you talking about? You know what I'm talking about. No. Don't go off like this, for Christ's sake, Rosie! Rosie! Rose! Somebody broke your wings Little bird you can't fly Somebody hurt you bad Feeling down And the price you have to pay You'll be paying, years of your life Yeah? Both legs and one arm are broken. Oh, Christ. He has to stay in hospital for a couple of days. What are you going to do? I guess I'll have to go back and forth for a while. My sister will stay with him when I'm not here. I'll be home tomorrow. Are you all right? Yeah, I'll be fine. OK. Bye. And the price you have to pay You'll be paying Years of your life - Shouldn't you be in bed? - What for? Well, sit down. Breakfast is ready. I'm taking good care of my guy. She's got to come back on her own, Jack. She will. I know kids. Could you get an ashtray, please? Sure. You just need to let her cool off for a while, you know? Somebody gotta help you I believe I love you so Somebody's gonna touch you I don't believe I'll let you go Rosie, open the door! I'm sorry. You were right. I was scared. We should never have let the world in. I wish it could just be us, like it was before. The happiest man in the whole wide world. I was the happiest man, Rosie. I was. I can't go back. I can't see her again. - Where are you going? - I'm going to go try and make a transaction. Can you move out for that? What about fifteen? Twenty. Tomorrow night, OK? Thank you. She's leaving by tomorrow night. Really? We'll have to stay in this godforsaken place for tonight. - Take off your shoes. - You've got to be kidding me. Off. Yeah. - Lie down. - I don't want to lie down in here. This place gives me the creeps. I like it. It's going to be fun. Remember how we used to camp out? Yeah, but... ...not in housing developments. What are you feeding me here? Beans. I want you to promise me something. That thing that you said a while back, that when I die, you were going to die, I want you to take that back. Take it back. I promise I'll try. Little flower. I'm so happy. Oh, God. Oh, God, forgive me. No, no... Oh, God... Oh, my God... We've got a whole day to kill. We may as well go to the mainland. Why do people want everything to be so ugly? I was thinking of paying Marty Rance a visit. You can ask him yourself. Got it. That's it. Hello. Where did you say that you lived? We're on the south side of Marsh island, by the tip. - I didn't think that was developed yet. - There's an old commune out there. We live on that. Oh, yes. - Jack Slavin. Of course. - Jack Slavin! - Marty, man! - This is a surprise. I'm making the rounds, getting to know my neighbours. I'm glad you came by. This is Rose. - Rose. - Would you like some coffee? Er... I'll take some coffee, sure. - Rose? - No, thanks. Well, nice! How's that appeal coming? As a matter of fact, I was going to give you a call. That isn't a wetland any more. As a matter of fact, that isn't a house any more. Mind if I er... - What do you mean? - Go see for yourself. I'm just going to build it again, you know. If you build it again, I'll have to knock it down again. - I don't want to have to call the police. - Call them. I don't mind. Listen, Jack... I realise you and I have had our differences, but by the same token, you can't stop progress. You can't stop the future from happening. People have a right to build. Laws change all the time pertaining to the environment, as the community's needs change. I believe in putting people first. That's just my personal belief. But I want you to feel comfortable with the situation, so you need to tell me how that can happen. What the hell do you mean, "comfortable"? Well, it occurs to me that I haven't ever expressed... my interest in your land to you. There you are. You didn't have to. I want you to know that if the day comes where you want to move on... to, say, a less-developed part of the world... We all have our dreams of how we want to retire. Anyhow, if that day ever comes, call me. I think you'd be surprised at how much your place is worth now. When did you purchase the property? Oh, you're looking... I'd guesstimate you're looking at... a 200% profit on your investment, and that's conservative. - Is that so? - Think about it. You know, I have to say, er... ...with our history, Jack, I would never have dreamed... that you'd end up at my breakfast table. Why? Mm? We're not so... We're not so very different from each other, you and me. Well, I gotta hear this. Well, we both do whatever the fuck we want. Right? And we... We both turn a blind eye to the consequences, us. That's the way of the future, right? I'm a businessman. I'm not... I'm not a... I know what you are. I'm just seeing it now for the first time, right now. This minute, I'm seeing it. You have a vision, too. Right? My land is like a blot... ...on your perfect universe. When you see all these... these box houses, these imitation colonial homes, you get... you get a feeling of what? Of everything being in its place, of accomplishment. Right, well, when I see them... When I see them, I want to punch a hole through the walls and set fire to them. So... So... ...the main difference between you and me, really, is that... is that you, you... love those little houses, and I hate those little houses and... ...it all boils down to... to taste. And I ruined her out of some kind of snobbery. - Ruined whom? - Dad, let's go home. It was about something different. I... I know it was, but I can't remember, God forgive me. - I can't remember. - I remember. Do you need a doctor? Does he need a doctor? Oh, God... All right, Marty, you win. I'll sell. - It's my land still. I want to sell it. - Great, but... just think about it. - I'll come by tomorrow. - I don't need to. I just want to get rid of it. - No! - We'll talk about it in the morning. I'll come by... No! Write me out a fucking check, you imbecile. - Let me drive you. Let me help you. - Please, don't. Don't. Turns out Marty's a decent guy. Didn't want to take advantage of me. What are you doing? You know what I'm doing. You'll be free of this whole... thing. Get an education, you know, try and... You've got to make a life for yourself. I have a life! I mean, you can't just give up like this. Sweetheart, I gave up a long time ago. I just didn't realise it. I mean, how can he tell you, "You can't stop the future from happening"? - Who made him the future? - It's not his fault. It's just... That's... That's the way things are. He's... Everything's for sale. Everything. Please don't sell it. Please don't give up. Your daddy he's an outlaw And a wanderer by trade He'll teach you how to pick and choose And how to throw the blade He oversees his kingdom So no stranger does intrude His voice it trembles as he calls out For another plate of food One more cup of coffee for the road One more cup of coffee 'fore I go To the valley below I'm chilly. Thanks. I... I think I'll just go up for a while. I'll be up in a minute, OK? Thanks, sweetheart. That's better. We've got work to do. Forgive me. Go to sleep. Dad? Dad? Looking back, O beloved I remember things, you said to me In the garden Before the black sun rose Things you said To... me Things you said, O beloved And the promise that, you took from me Now I see you Standing next to me Standing next To Me Saying; "Promise Me" Looking back, O beloved I remember things, you said to me In the garden Before the black sun rose Standing next To Me Saying; "Promise Me" Saying; "Promise Me" sync, fix: titler
