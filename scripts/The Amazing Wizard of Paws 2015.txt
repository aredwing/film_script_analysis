That's how you do it. You watching? Now go just like this. "And so the cowboys sat down by the crackling campfire they had prepared." And roasted marshmallows? And roasted marshmallows. And popped popcorn. Heh. And popped popcorn. That's right. And roasted hot dogs. And roasted hot dogs! How did you know that? Hey, Daddy, will you be home in time for my birthday? I wouldn't miss it for the world, sport. There you go, buddy. That's great, hon. I know you'll get it, Salesman of the Year for sure. Just wish you didn't have to go on the road so much. I ordered the cake, and the balloons arrive on Thursday. What time do you leave? Just waiting for takeoff. Okay, well, we really need to go on a trip, like, soon. We will, I promise. Oh, and, honey, if you have time, can you pick up a space shuttle souvenir for Bobby? I Will. You know what? I'm gonna let you go, okay? Have a safe flight. I'll call you when I get to Houston. - Okay. - I love you. I love you. Bobby! Oh, God. Got you. Okay. Here. The back door is always locked. I don't even understand how he could have opened it. Well, you got lucky this time. Thank you. - We'll see you later. - Thank you. Okay, sweetie pie. Hey, hon. Hey, hon. Plane got in early. I'll be there soon. Do you need me to pick anything up? No. Just get home. We've missed you. Hows my little guy doing? I just put him to bed a little while ago. You know, I'm starting to think that you went out of town on purpose. Prepping a five-year-old's birthday party isn't easy. What'd the doctor say? He's fine. He's fine. He just swallowed some water. Are we sure that was a dog? Maybe it was a coyote. They've been seen a lot in the neighborhood lately. All I can tell you is it saved Bobby's life. After the 18th, no more out-of-town meetings for a while. Really? Hmm, that's great news. I don't like it when you go out of town, and Bobby needs his father around. I get lonely when you're away. Things are going to change, hon. Hey, I'll see you in 20. Bye. Well, Bobby, tell me how you feel. I'll be right back, Bobby. Well, it seems that Bobby has acquired acute agoraphobia. What is that? It's a serious anxiety condition that can affect the way in which a child or an adult deals with everyday, normal social activities and interaction. In Bobby's case, it was undoubtedly triggered by the loss of his father. He has been acting like that ever since Jack died. Hey, Why don't you show me one of those magic tricks that Dr. Abernack taught you? Okay. Wow! Where did it go? That was so good. It's magic. That was good. Well, you're not a coyote, are you? Can we keep him? Oh. Well, he doesn't seem to have a name tag. It's just this... this old key. Does it unlock something? I don't know. Be careful, sweetie. We don't know if he's friendly. Oswald. His name is Oswald. Ozzy. Heh. He seems friendly. Well, honey, don't get too attached. He might belong to somebody else. He might be missing. This little guy, This little guy, he's going to help Bobby... control his agoraphobia. Dogs are amazingly spiritual animals. They've been assisting people with medical conditions for centuries now. One might even call them magical. Heh heh. He still has anxieties about socializing. The dog has become his security blanket, his confidant. So Ozzy's going to bring him out into the world and not be afraid. May I help you? I've come to retrieve my dog. Your... Your dog? You're Ozzy's owner? Yes. Troublesome little creature. He escaped from his dwellings. Well, it's been quite some time. After a few months, we figured he didn't have a home. Why didn't you contact us sooner? I live far away, quite far. Bobby has become pretty attached to this dog. I- I' I would like to see my dog, please. Do you have anything that you can show me that-that he is your dog? How did... How did you get this address? We only put our phone number on the poster. 911. There's a man trying to break into my house. Bobby, stay in your room! Close the door! Darn. One day, I'm going to be the greatest magician in the world. Ozzy, pick a card. We'll shuffle. Is this your card? Thank you. Thank you. Another few weeks, please? Another few weeks, please? I know my payment is late. Please, can't you extend the grace period? I've never been delinquent on my mortgage before. I recently lost my job, and my husband... passed... several years ago. I've managed this long. Please, just another few weeks? Come on. Let's go. Come on, Ozzy. Okay, be good. Have fun. Hey, can we pet your service dog, you little wuss? Hey, leave him alone. Pick on someone your own size. Oh, are you his girlfriend? Are those your girlfriends? Hey, give me back my backpack. Give it... Give it to me! Come on. Give it back! Throw something at me again, and you're dead meat. Leave him alone! Let's get out of here. Help. Help. Help me, please. Ozzy. Call somebody? Hi. Hi. What can I get for you? Can I have a milkshake? Sure. What kind? - Chocolate. - Okay. Thanks. If you leave My life will become... Hey, kid! No dogs allowed. But he's my service dog, sir. I don't care if he's the First Dog of the United States. Get that dog out of here now. Are you listening to me?! What's the matter with you, kid? Get that dog out of here now. But he helps me for... for medical reasons. You don't look handicapped to me. He's my companion. He's licensed to go everywhere with me. I don't care if he has a license to drive. Get that mutt out of here. Now! Come on, Ozzy. Tiny, do that again, and you're fired. Thanks for calming me down, Ozzy. Sorry. No lunch scraps. Well, we better be getting home soon. Mom's going to be looking for us. Come on, Ozzy. Huh. $20 bill? Aww. What a cute dog. - Can I pet him? - Sure. Is he a working dog? He helps me leave the house. He's my best friend. HOW'd that get there? Whoa. What is this? Could you please tell me how much the book is? Not sure I have enough money. $20. That's exactly how much I have. Thanks. Come on, Ozzy. Hmm. It's locked. I can't open it. Looks like it needs some kind of... key or something. No, it... it couldn't be. Oh, it... it's not in English. One day, I'll be the greatest magician ever, and then we can take over the world. I... Sorry. Did you see that? Abracadabra? How'd I do that? Hello, Bobby. Hello. Who are you? I am Zazasphorous. And how do you know my name? Oh, I know all about you. This is Ozzy. Oh, I know. He is a good animal. I miss him. You miss him? Well, I was once his guardian and master, and now you are his master. I don't understand. I sent Pharsophrises, Ozzy as you call him now, to protect you. To protect me? Ah, all these years, he has watched over you. He has been your guardian since you were quite young. He has protected you from harm. And now you must protect the book. Protect the book? The book should never be used for evil. Why me? It has always been your destiny, and now that you have turned the key, you have the power. You are the chosen one. Wait. What do you mean I'm the chosen one? Did that just happen? Abracadabra. Yeah, right. I have the power. "You are the chosen one." I'm hallucinating. How did I do that? You are the chosen one. Who said that'? Me, Four Legs, Pharsophrises, as the old wizard calls me. But I prefer Ozzy. Dogs don't talk. Y-You can't talk. Hmm. Well, if you can talk, why didn't you talk before? I had nothing to say. Actually, until you opened the book, I was silenced for centuries. You've been around for centuries? How old are you? 623 years old. That's about 4,200 in dog years. This is unbelievable. - Hmm. - You can talk! Now, got to keep this quiet. You understand? I understand. This is amazing. Still can't read this. It's in some kind of foreign language or something. It's a magical book. You don't need to read it. The magic you believe is now the magic you create. Really? You have opened the magic connection between the book and the key. As long as they remain with you, you have the power. - Hey, Mom. - Hey, honey. What are you and Ozzy up to? Ah, nothing. Oh, I've been meaning to remind you. Don't leave the lights on in the hallway during the clay. It costs money. Sure. Dry your eyes tonight We got a way to make it right The secret's in your eyes that speak You hide But I'll seek We're gonna make it We'll make it One chance, let's take it... I could have sworn I put that quiche in the oven a minute ago. Tonight We're living out our dreams Tonight We're living out our Our fantasies And it's a good thing Baby The real thing It's real 'Cause I found you And, baby, you found me And you found me Nana na na na Nananana Na na na na na... Ozzy, let's get out of here. Your dog helping you with your schoolwork again, dork? He's talking to you. Come on. You listening to me? Over here. How'd you get over there? Whuh. It's in English now. It's actually not. You're able to see the words in English. How come I can read them HOW? Because you have the power. The book has accepted you. You are its protector. Protector of what? You must protect the book to protect the world. Protect the world? There is much evil that starves for this book, evil that will feed off the power of this book, evil that can destroy your world as you know it. To protect the world as you know it. And remember to keep the key close to you at all times. Wait. What evil? Who? Come on, Ozzy. Come on. - Thanks, Mom. - Have fun. I'll pick you up after the movie, okay? Okay. Oh, and no popcorn for Ozzy. - No popcorn for Ozzy? - Shh! Come on. I've been wanting to see this movie so bad. It's all about magic and wizards. That looks like our book. It's Lord Gargheon. Wow. This is the best 3-D ever. Ozzy, we got to get out of here now. You are the chosen one. Bobby, what are you doing? I'm not gonna be bullied anymore. Let's see what this magic can do. You have the power. Come on, Ozzy. Come on, Ozzy. The evil wizard is now very old and losing his powers. He needs the book to stop aging and regain his powers, for he will be back, and he wants the book. He needs the book. Maybe I should just give it to him. No. No, no. The book must never get into the hands of the evil one. And if it does? The world will be in danger. Magic is like fire. In the right hands, it can do nothing but good. But in the wrong hands, the hands of evil, it can do nothing but bad, it can only destroy. If the Lord Gargheon comes back, you must destroy the book. What happens if the book is destroyed? Then neither good nor evil can use the magic. I'll lose all my powers to do magic? Magic fueled by the book, yes. You need to enter the school talent show. Why? It will help you get over your social anxiety. That's what you're for. You help me do that. And I'm helping you by telling you to enter the school talent show. I'm scared. Of what? You know I don't like crowds. That's why you have me. Look, you're my best friend in the whole world. I wouldn't be able to get out of bed if it weren't for you. You're going to be the greatest magician in the world, remember? I guess it would be kind of fun entertaining people. It's a great feeling to make someone smile. You've got magic powers now, kid. Do you really think we should enter? If you don't, I will. Hey, kid, what'd I tell you about bringing that dog in here the last time? Abracadabra. Do be tiny. What you trying, some hocus-pocus on me? What-What you do to me? Come on, Ozzy. Let's go. What'd you do to me, man? Where y'all goin... Hey! Hey! You did not... Hey! Hey, on the house, you could have a milkshake. You could have some French fries. Just come back and make me big again. I'm too insecure like this. I warned you, Tiny. You're fired. I'm what?! You need to do more prestidigitation. You mean like sleight of hand? Close-up magic, right? Prestidigitation. But I can't seem to pronounce it. Prestidigita-tation. Prestidigitation. Yeah, I know what you mean. You know, coin tricks, card tricks, floating objects, swapping things under cups. Prestipaticipation. Artisticat... constipation. Prestidigitation. Yeah, I can do this. I can do this. I can't do this. Don't be nervous. I'm here. And remember, nothing too spectacular. Thump, thump goes my drums And the sound of my heart when you're near Oh, say, can you see By the dawn's early light And the home of the brave Good evening, ladies and gentlemen, teachers and students. Lam the Great Bobbini, and this is my trusty assistant Ozzy. Better wow them now, or you've lost 'em. I thought you said don't overdo it. I make mistakes. And now shall make my trusty assistant Ozzy disappear. Ozzy. And now for my final trick. Ozzy, please. That was great, wasn't it? That was great, wasn't it? - You were great. - You were great. See, and the magic made you come out of your shell. You weren't shy. Yeah, I guess it did. I just wanted to entertain everyone. How do we do that, anyway? A good magician never reveals how he does a trick. Yeah, but I'm the magician. I should know howl did the trick. When we get home, I'll show you how we did the trick. This is how we did the trick. - Aww. - Aww. So adorable. Hey, Oh, hi. I love your dog. He's so cute. Thanks. That was so cool what you did back at school. Where did you learn how to do magic like that? Friend of mine, Dr. Abernack taught me. He said it'd help me get over my shyness. I read once that Houdini and other magicians were really very shy. Really? Bobby, there's some kids at the door asking for you. Huh? - What do they want? - I don't know. They said they know you from school. Hope they're not here to beat me up. Hey, we thought you'd like to join our team, come play baseball at the park with us. Um, I don't know. You were great at the talent show the other day. Yeah. How'd you do those tricks? A good magician never reveals his secrets. Well, are you gonna join our team or not? I don't... I don't know. Come on. What are you afraid of? Okay. Let me go get Ozzy's leash. We don't need that dog. He'll try and catch the ball. He'll get in the way. No, he won't. He doesn't even chase balls. He's not like a regular dog. Can't you go anywhere without him? Yeah. Leave him here. What's wrong with you? Come on, guys. We don't need this kid. He's still a loser. But if I have all these powers, why can't I stop the foreclosure on the house? Why can't I make money just magically appear? And why can't I bring Dad back? It doesn't work that way. Magic doesn't solve problems. Then what does it do? Even I can't answer that, Bobby. I'm sorry. Mom. What's wrong? I'm fine, sweetie. What are you doing up? Can't sleep. Thinking about Dad again? Yeah. Yeah, me, too. Why? It's okay, Mom. There's nothing we could've done. Hey, I'm real proud of you. Huh? My little Houdini. You were so great, you took home first prize. My little boy is gonna be a great magician. Thanks. I'm so proud of you, honey. Now go to bed. Okay, Don't want to be a frog no more Don't want to be green What are you doing, Ozzy? Expecting someone? Don't need to be a toad no more I've got to be me Who could that be? Come close, my love, and kiss me nice Your prince will be free 16.95. Who gave you permission to order a pizza? Look, I didn't, okay? I swear. Just keep the change. We're on a budget, remember? If you wanted a pizza, all you had to do was ask. I don't want you calling without my permission. You got it? Got it. Make sure they didn't forget the anchovies. What was that, honey? Uh, I just said, "Hope they didn't forget the anchovies." Thanks for the pizza, Mom. Yeah, all right. Hurry. I'm starving. Do you have an exceptional talent?

We gotta find a way to stall him long enough to perform for the judges. Come on. Ozzy, you're brilliant. Ozzy, you're brilliant. I didn't say anything. You've given me a great idea. - I have? - Uh-huh. These cards say who's next. Yeah. These cards say who's next. Yeah. Ah, here we are. Hi. - Hi. - All right. - Hello. - How are you? Good evening, ladies... and gentleman. I'm the Great Bobbini, and this is my trusty assistant Ozzy. For my first trick, I shall... Just one... I'm not ready yet. Yes, you are. Trust yourself. Do one of the tricks you designed the other night. He's talking to his dog. But does the dog talk back? That would be magic. Okay. Bobby and small furry person, what is it that you do exactly? We do magic. Ooh, magic. Oh, great. - Abracadabra, we love it. - Yeah. We want to be wowed. Ah. Ah, that's something. That's magic. Seems to be hovering. It's magic. What else do you have there, little man? Where's the snow? Right. Just trying to find something here. All right. That was surprising. - Okay. All right. - That's good. That's good. All right. This must be the big one. This is the... This is big... This is the finale. Where'd the dog go? The dog is no longer there. - All right. And magic. - That's very good. Magic. It's very cute, but I'm not sure it's what we're looking for. And now, I give you not only a trunk, but the elephant that comes with it. All right. All right. That's pretty cool. - Thanks, Bobby. - Not at all. However, we have seen this one before. Ifs sort of like a circus trick. Not sure if you have anything else that we haven't seen, perhaps. Hey, Ozzy, the judges say they've seen this before. How 'bout we show 'em something they haven't seen? - Oh. - Oh, my. That is a large canine. Yeah. - W-Wow. - Wow. That's magic. How did he do that? We have not seen that. No, we haven't seen that. Must be some mirrors... Or a giant dog costume? Smoke or... Very well done, Bobby. - Very well done. - That was very good. Come up here. Congratulations, Bobby. You're moving on to the next round. We'll see you in Vegas. Congratulations, Bobby. See you in Vegas, Bobby. That, that's the only magician we're going to let in. Okay. Me and Ozzy have a plan so that we don't lose the house. We're not losing the house. What gave you that idea? Everything's fine. Go. Go. How we going to get to the callbacks? They're 600 miles or more from here. They gave you a plane ticket. We can't let Mom know we're trying to save the house. It's supposed to be a surprise, remember? Then you need to create a portal. A pol-tar;? An entrance we can step through here that brings us out there. Oh, you mean like that time when you went in one box and out the other? Exactly. Hmm. How 'bout a toilet? Everybody's got a toilet, right? I guess that would work. Heh. It would be like a portal potty. Ah, that could get messy. I think your bedroom closet would work just fine. - Should we test it? - Of course, to be sure it works. Okay. On with the show. Let's see where I go. Step through, and see where it takes you. I think it works. We're gonna be late. Hurry, Ozzy. What time are the callbacks for the audition? Less than an hour. We... I need time to get changed, and then we have to make sure that the portals still working. - Come on. - Let's go. Come on, Ozzy. Come on. Where is everybody? This isn't the way home. We're going uptown. Ozzy, we gotta get off this bus now. Ah! Hand over the key and take me to the book. Now! Bobby! Look out. Bobby! Hold on. Shoo da da doo Lalala Shoo da da doo Lala Fly away Like birds of a feather So good together You and me We're like a panoramic view With the beautifulest hues Of a picture-perfect place Only you and I can grace Only you know what I mean So let's just close our eyes together and dream Bobby. You okay? We missed the callbacks for the show. Now we'll never have a chance to save the house. We had our one chance, and we missed it. Hmm. I've got an idea. Bobby, who are you talking to? Uh, just talking on my phone. Well, don't be long. It's expensive. I won't. So what's your idea? So we're gonna take my toy steam engine back in time? To the audition callbacks. Look, it's one thing to step through a portal to another place, but to another time? I can't do that kind of magic. Yes, you can, with my help. Okay. Abracadabra. Abracadabra. Abracadabra. It's not working. - Try a rhyme. - A rhyme? I'm not good at rhymes. Hmm. I need to go back in time to the audition... Hmm. Nothing rhymes with "audition." Hmm. We missed the audition. We need to go back. I can't do this. I can't figure out how to do this in rhyme. Just wanted to go back in time. Yes. I did it. Get up, get UP - Get in - Yes! I'm going like a freight train - Oh, yeah! And I'm never gonna stop Getup, get up, get in - I'm living in the moment - Yeah! Oh, yeah! On the way m the top Yeah! All right! Wait. We're going backwards. Of course, silly. We're going back in time, not forward in time. That makes sense. Ozzy. Ozzy, wake up. We're here. It's still nighttime. Maybe the train took us back to last night so that we can get a good night's sleep for the audition. - Hmm. - Let me check my phone. I'm not getting any reception on my cellphone. We went back too far, way too far. Quick, think of a rhyme to go forward, forward in time. I had enough trouble figuring out how to rhyme the first time. What rhymes with "forward"? Augh. Nothing rhymes with "forward." Hmm. On the train, need to go forward. Just take us away. We don't want to stay. Where are we? I don't know. We're still not in the present. We're still seven years too early. We didn't go anywhere. This is our hometown newspaper. We're not in Vegas. - It's a $50 coupon. - For what? It's real. - 50 bucks. - Hmm. I'm hungry. You hungry? I'm a dog. I'm always hungry. Let's go. Boy, I didn't realize how hungry I was. That dog was scrumptious. What's for dessert? We have to get back to the train soon, but I'm a little thirsty. We should stop and get something to drink. But we can't miss the callbacks this time. We gotta win. Mom needs that money to pay for the mortgage. Otherwise, we're going to be homeless. Come on, Ozzy. Excuse me. Are you sure you're okay to drive? What's it to you, kid? Look, I don't think it's safe for you to be driving right now, mister. What's it your business you telling me what to do? Why don't you call a cab? You harassing me? I'm gonna call the cops. No. Look, I've got... $30 left. That should be enough for a cab. You're right, kid. You really do care. Someone does. I gotta go, mister. Thank you, kid. Thanks, dog. Don't mention it. Yeah, I need a cab. It was good to do a good deed. Ready to ride? We're still too early, so take us on a trip, seven more years. Let's go. Zip, zip, zip. Getup, get up, get in I'm going like a freight train And I'm never gonna stop Getup, get up, get in I'm living in the moment On the way m the top Ozzy, we're here. We made it. Hmm. I'm not sure... Is this our Bobby that we liked? Supposed to be magic, right'? Uh... Look, somethings wrong, okay? I'm feeling a little weak. Gargheon's got the key now. It's taking away some of your power from the book. You need to concentrate. Try harder. Okay. Here we go. Ta-da. Heh. All right. Well, that might've been enough magic for today, all right? Thank you. Please, just give me a chance. Look, I can create an illusion that no one has ever seen before. My sweet little magic man, I'm going to tell you what I told Jason Beiver when I saw him perform when he was just seven years old. - Oh, my. - I said, "Jason, you are like a bird soaring through the air." You're the bird. Soaring high. And that bird... Has been shot. - Right. - Do you see? And it falls, and ifs just... It's feathers now, and it's just... It's flailing about all over the ground. - Ifs really sad. - It's not good. Okay. But you have wings, Bobby. Use them. And never give up on your dreams. Your dreams, Bobby. Thank you. Next. There he was, I mean, began the weeping. There he was, I mean, began the weeping. Just the excessive little display of feeling. What is that? It's the parents. It's the grandparents. Excuse me! Wait! It's our little magician. Oh, yes, the dead bird. Look, kid, I don't know how to tell you this, but you didn't make it, all right? Perhaps if you work really hard, you could perform at a casino someday. Ohh. - Wait. - Sorry. Can't we talk this out? Come on. Just give me a chance. Wait! Have you ever seen a dog turn into a werewolf? No. All right, I have to admit that was impressive, but it's not even a full moon or anything, so... Yes. Yes. You are absolutely right. It is said that one can only transform in the light of a full moon. An old tale has it that the first werewolf was spotted in a small-town village in eastern Europe. Legend has it that the power of the full moon caused the blood of the would-be werewolves to pump faster and harder, forcing them to literally jump out of their skins to become the werewolf. Please turn your attention to the current crescent moon. Let's make the perfect night for a werewolf, shall we? How did... You know, let's make it a blue moon at that. Are you seeing that? Okay, this is really weird. I'm not sure how to take that. I don't know how... That can't be rigged up. All right, kid. Congratulations. You made it to the finals. - Let's go. - That's good. Yes. Thank you, guys. Congratulations. I'm proud of you, kid. Thanks. This is the time You made me believe in me You made me believe in me You made me shine Taught me how to spread my wings Oh, darling Oh, darling We're gonna be great on the show, Oz. We're gonna be great on the show, Oz. Oz? Ozzy? Where are you? Mmm. Oh, good. Fridge needs some stocking. Oz? This isn't funny. Hello, Bobby. Weren't expecting me, were you? HOW'd you get in here? Your mother let me in. No, she didn't. Is my mom okay? Mom? Mom? She can't help you right now. What did you do to my mom? Where's Ozzy? They're both a little petrified at the moment. You'd better not hurt them. Now, I'm looking for the lock that fits this key. I'll never give you the book. Then you'll never see your mother and Ozzy again. Bobby, now that I have the key, I absorb much of your power. The closer I am to the book, the weaker you get, the stronger I become. I can feel the magic draining from your veins. Now, big man, give me the book. You want the book? You're not using the powers. How can you do that? This is an illusion. A good magician never reveals how he does his tricks. It's time to close this chapter. Ozzy? Ozzy. You okay, Oz? Oz? Say something. Say something. Say something! Ozzy, I don't care if you can't talk. I love you anyway. Even before you could speak or any of this strange wizard stuff happened, you were always the most magical thing in my life. Bobby?! Bobby?! Are you okay? Are you okay? I'm fine. Ozzy's fine, too. The bad man left. He won't be back. I no longer have the book to sustain my energy. I must go soon. The book is safe now, locked away forever, thanks to you, Bobby. Well, I guess I'll never be a great magician. You are a great magician. How can you say that? I don't have magical powers anymore. But you don't need otherworldly powers to be a good magician. Who designed those magic tricks? You did. Who performed them flawlessly? You did. Yeah, but I had help. I can't do them by myself. Now I'll have to quit the show, and we'll lose the house. Oh, but what about all those great illusions you did? You created them from scratch. The book didn't give you those ideas. Those ideas were yours and yours alone. The magic is inside of you, Bobby. We're not gonna make the final show on time, even if we fly. The magic is inside of you, Bobby. Thanks, Zazasphorous. Give it everything, don't hold back Give it everything, don't hold back Just lay it on the line, this is your time to shine You're going to go far...

Lam the Great Bobbini, and this is my trusty assistant Ozzy. Today we'd like to do some prestidigitation for you. Now, if you don't know what that word means, it means the art of close-up magic using sleight of hand. And I can't tell you how long it took me to pronounce that. Mom, Dad, look. My friend Bobby's on TV. All right. Ozzy, pick a card. Pick a card. He's picked the jack of diamonds. All right. Uh, would you kindly hold up your sign? Now, um, would you please flip that over? Thank you. And now for my final trick, I shall be the first magician ever to hypnotize an animal, my dog OZZY-. Sit. Sit. Sit. Sit. Sit. Whoo! Sit. Thank you. Sit up. Now, Ozzy, I need you to concentrate. Look into my eyes. And the countdown... Ozzy, I need you to concentrate, okay? On the countdown from 3, 2, 1, I want you to become as still as a mannequin. 3,2,1. Freeze. Whenever Ozzy disappears, I know how to make him reappear. Ozzy, you want a cookie? We had some great talent tonight. We had over 12 million votes online. Our computers have tallied them up. Ladies and gentlemen, this is live. In third place, we have... Jaycee. And in second place, we have... the Great Bobbini. And your million-dollar winner is... the Dancing Dolls. We didn't win. And I know you'd probably say that I came in second and I did it all my own, but that's not gonna save the house. Making fun of me. Making fun of me. - Hey, hey, hey. - Yeah. - Stop! - Think I'm old? - Stop! - Think I'm old? - I'll show you old. - [veins 1. Hey, buddy. Hi. Dad? Yeah? But... - What's with the tux? - How? You... Are you okay, Bobby? Dad. Ah, hey, I love you, too, sport. I can't believe it. I can't believe it. But how? You told me that magic couldn't save Dad or the house, but it did. Hello, Bobby. - Hello, Ozzy. - Zazasphorous? But I thought I'd never see you again. I think you need to understand what happened and to know that you are the reason your father is alive. What do you mean? There was a hiccup, a delay in the time-space continuum, but your father is now alive because of you. Bobby, you changed the future by doing one simple good deed. Nice. You cast a spell on my heart You cast a spell on my heart You waved your wand and ignited that spark You cast a spell on my heart It feels like it's breaking when we're apart Even when I was alone in the dark Now I can see Something you did made it all... Thanks for being there for me, Oz, after all those years. I think I can do it on my own now. D-Don't worry, though. You'll always, you know, be my best friend, but it's just not your job anymore. And put that smile on your face I want to be that man I want to be that man Who gives it all I can Just open your eyes, and let... Bosloy's Pizzeria. Can I help you?
