Tower. # The whole city knows by now # # Goose.. remove your crown # Goose. # I told you, Tower # # The Goose can't be dominated # At the height of summer.. the Sienese sharpen their weapons to gain supremacy in Piazza del Campo. During the Palio, it's like going back to the 1400s when the city was divided into separately governed districts. Some districts are enemies because of boundary disputes and other districts are enemies because of historical insults. The Palio is life, it's the essence of this city. Every Sienese is born.. raised and buried in the church of his district. The Sienese have a love/hate relationship with the jockeys. The victorious jockey is an idol.. but the losing jockey is a traitor. The jockey holds the district's destiny in his hands. Ram. She-Wolf. The shenanigans begin when the starting line up is called out. That's when the jockeys start negotiating to gain advantage or to disadvantage their enemies. It's much more than a horse race. You need to use your brain. Cunning is more important than strength. Wait. I rode 28 Palios and won five times. I started in 1978 and ended in 1996. In that Palio.. Aceto and I were declining, on our way out. Every 20 years, somebody new comes in. In these 90 seconds you burn or realize a year's work. They are furiously whipping each other. They're on the third lap. Trecciolino.. a Sienese jockey... Wins the Palio for the first time. Having been born in Siena, the Palio is in my blood. I was born to be a Palio jockey. Gigi's first victory for Goose was my last Palio. And from then on he's kept on winning. Gigi Bruschelli, known as Trecciolino, is victorious. Trecciolino has shown once more to be the greatest. If you believe you can achieve big things, you will. The horse wasn't considered strong. Now you see the difference a good jockey makes. The King of the Square has won again. Trecciolino has managed the impossible yet again! This jockey seems invincible. The favorite jockey with the favorite horse. Gigi Bruschelli has won his 11th victory. Trecciolino has achieved 13 victories. I've won 13 Palios.. so far! Gigi Bruschelli has monopolized the square. To win 13 times in 16 years proves he's better off the horse than on the horse. Understanding the Sienese and the Palio gave me an advantage over outsider jockeys. My name is Giovanni Atzeni, nicknamed Tittia. I'm 28 years old. I've ridden 18 Palios, quite a lot. Only two victories for Goose. I've ridden a few good Palios but many terrible ones but people have always forgiven me and encouraged me to go on. I was born in Germany.. my mom's German and my dad's Sardinian. Since I was five, my dad kept horses as a hobby. After nursery he'd teach me how to ride. When I was little, I rode in the local races in Sardinia. I didn't speak a word of Italian. It was difficult for me. I watched the Palio on TV. I hoped for it, it was a dream, it seemed impossible. I was lucky to meet Gigi Bruschelli in Sardinia. He spotted me at a local horse race and suggested I come to Siena and give it a go. I arrived at 17 and was with Gigi for two years. I worked every day from dawn till dusk. I worked hard so as not to think of my family. I missed them. Gigi Bruschelli taught me a lot. He perfected my bareback skills. He taught me how to live in this city. It is said you are against Bruschelli. I'm against nobody. I work for myself and the districts I race for. They all become competitors when they leave my stable. My problem with the younger jockeys is that they don't have the balls to overthrow the regime of Gigi Bruschelli. If my boy doesn't go up that hill properly when he gets off his horse, I'll break his neck. Now I train Federico, I hope he'll be a good Palio jockey and that he'll debut in the Piazza next year, but it will be difficult. You did very well, Federico. The horse did very well, too. We're doing well. You need to concentrate on the start. Let's take the bridle off. I'm in town. You will find me at Sergio's. Do you remember this? Amazing! 1978. This is your first Palio. - I'm moved.. I swear. - Poor darling. - How old were you? I was 24. "Bastiano riding Urbino scored an exciting victory for Forest. Forecasts overturned. " All the experts thought that I would fall at the first bend. - You did almost fall. - Don't talk bullshit.. where? At the Casato bend. What the hell are you talking about? - Are you drunk? - No.. I'm not. When I reached that bend, I stooped down. Let me show you the photos. I had to avoid the flag. I did this. That's funny. Here it is! Who's this? It's me, but I'm not close to falling. - It's the horse that stumbled. - Yes.. the horse. The horse is close to stumbling. Don't speak badly about the horse that made you famous. You should recognize him. This is Aceto.. look how ugly he was. I can't believe we're friends now. Look at his face. Aceto holds the record for winning the most Palios. 14 Palios is a very difficult record to break. Aceto was my biggest enemy. He gave money to his allies who would attack me between the ropes or while I was riding. The world turns because of love and hate. I didn't love him, I hated him and this made me feel good. Even when I lost, if I managed to make him lose too.. it gave me great pleasure. It was a real turn-on. We're entering the kingdom of Andrea Degortes.. nicknamed Aceto. Nothing better to do on a rainy day? The Palio is not about riding skills, it's about the game. If it were just about riding skills, I'd have won 30 Palios and Bruschelli would've won three. Aceto makes history.. the most expert jockey. He's done it again.. a dramatic race. His 14th Palio, he's broken all records! I duped the whole world. Like Attila, where my horse trod, no grass would grow. I'm number one.. I can face anyone. I'm used to sitting at the head of the table. Always. When Pavarotti came here.. I sat at the head of the table, not him. If you're a number-one bandit.. then you're like me, but if you're a shitty bandit, you can get lost. If you're like Maradona, then we can talk. But Bruschelli is a nobody! No doubt Gigi wants to beat Aceto's record. To equal Aceto's record.. he needs one more win. So July and August are vital for him to beat the record. It took me five years to understand the Palio. First you have to get into the mindset of the Sienese. The Palio is a game.. not a race. At first I thought it was just a race.. but there's more to it. The Sienese work 365 days a year on the Palio. The district wins a painted cloth banner. The glory. The district doesn't win money, it's the jockey who wins money. But if you want to win you have to pay off other districts. As captain.. you have a responsibility to your district. You think about the Palio every single day. During the winter, the captain and his lieutenants must plan the Palio, but only fate will decide if it all goes well. A captain could do everything right, but if the jockey gets it wrong.. or sells himself he'll mess up the plan. The jockeys are not trusted. A victorious jockey is loved but a losing jockey might be considered corrupt. This year I really have to win or people will want someone new. His name is Guess, he's 11 years old. He's very healthy. He's run a few Palios but always been unlucky. In his first Palio, he finished third. He lacked experience. Then last year, he was second at the start. Reaching the San Martino bend. His angle was wrong.. so he fell and caused a pile up. I've trained this horse for years. I hope he'll be selected. Go, big bum. Siena is the only place where a horse can win without a jockey. What counts is the horse. Gigi Bruschelli has fallen. His riderless horse has won! The horse has won without Bruschelli. 13 Palios? He's won 12 Palios, not 13. Don't count the riderless win. Look at my pictures. Who's on the horse in all my victories? You. If you'd seen a photo without a jockey. you would've asked.. "Who was riding that horse?" I bet Bruschelli says that he wants to win 14 Palios. Tell him to forget it. He's won because of one reason. He's been riding alone. Many of the jockeys are his allies. Once we stopped he really took power. he took the keys to the city and began his reign. Have you cleaned her? He embedded himself alongside boys from his own stable. Do we have Naike? Naike, Osama, Polonsky.. Mocambo. Gigi Bruschelli is like an old lion who has a harem of districts at his disposal. No doubt the captains prefer certain jockeys. There are many strategies and deals. I can't really talk about this. Aceto and Bastiano can talk more about it. The retired jockeys. When I'll retire I'll be more open about it. Fede.. keep your hands low and your knees high. Let her run. You have good posture.. but to be a great Palio jockey, not a mediocre jockey, you need balls. Not small balls, big balls! So, less Facebook, less texting. Possibly more screwing.. but mostly concentrate. I want you to be the best because my reputation is at stake. So less chatting and more balls. This morning there are the first trials for inexperienced jockeys and horses to try out the Piazza. This happens only twice a year. You must be like a gladiator in the Colosseum. Be ready to take on a mortal challenge. I want you to be very determined, not like a granny shopping for cucumbers. I started skipping days at school so I thought I might as well go for it. My dream is to be a Palio jockey. I caught this beautiful sickness. Everybody out! A jockey mustn't fear injury. He must be ready to win or die. You mustn't get the trajectory wrong. Horses must pass through a 1.5-meter space. If you don't get it right, you'll hit the columns. Federico knows this. What can I do? I told him not to take it too tight. It's not up to us to worry about the boy. I never worried about myself.. how can I worry about him? To do this job.. he can't be delicate. There are many ways to fall. You fell like a gentleman. - Did you hurt yourself? No, nothing. - Maybe your arm hurts a bit? - I was better off before. This earth burns you. # Owl's whip is high up # # We hate Unicorn # # We are Unicorn # # When we arrive in the square # # Roll out the red carpet for us # The horse is allocated to the district four days before the race. The top jockeys wait to see where the horses end up. The best jockey is called by the district that gets the best horse. Five. Shell. One. Ram. Seven. She-Wolf. Porcupine. Unicorn. Once you know how good your horse is.. then you decide what to aim for. Either to block your enemy or to go for the win. Eight. Goose. For the past three years, I've ridden for Goose. My horse was allocated to the district I know. We have an excellent relationship. A stroke of luck. I am riding for this district. I have to try and win but also to stop our rival.. Tower. We have connected on a personal level with Giovanni. I really consider him a friend. He's like a member of Goose. This is the "Nerbo" that the jockeys hit each other with. On the face and the hands or on the head. But on the face or on the hands.. it hurts. You're an expert on this whip. What's it made of? The technical term.. Bernardino In your own words. This Nerbo is made of. - Of... - Of... The phallus of the... Which animal is it? - The ox. - The ox. It's stretched with a weight and dried. Originally it's short and stubby. - Yours would be like that. - You have a mini-Nerbo. For the four days of the Palio.. we live in Siena in the district that we ride for. We give them our mobile phone. We are watched by three bodyguards. You're always with them.. even when you sleep. We are sort of kidnapped. Because jockeys might take bribes from other districts. Jockeys in Siena are considered assassins. Mercenaries.. because they're paid. They're not always loyal to the district they ride for. Bastard! Son of a bitch! That zombie pisses me off. Gigi pisses me off.. he'll screw us up next time. Cool it.. ladies.. don't get excited. When was the last time Tortoise won? In August 2010.. we won with the Emperor. - Who's the Emperor? - Gigi Bruschelli. He manages to control Palios. He can control any situation. To win a Palio is very expensive. Each district pays with donations from its people. # By force and for love # The strongest love we have is for our district. It's unconditional love. Gigi sees a chance to win his 14th Palio. We want to see him with his whip high. We can't fail. It will be so. His neck hurts but I think the problem is his posture. My impression is that he gets defensive. The problem is not the shoulder.. rather his neck extension. There is a thickening on the left side of the nuchal ligament. - Maybe 'cause you... - No.. I didn't force him. That's the way he is. I haven't given him anything this morning. Let's have a look before you ride him. A good horse or a bad horse is all relative. What matters is a horse that fits your strategy. Porto Alabe.. go and return victorious! To the Tortoise! Eeny.. meeny, miny.. moe.. catch a tiger by the toe. - Panther will win. - Goose will. Damn, I'm drunk. Squeeze. We can all fit in! One, two.. three! In Siena we're all crazy! It's a muffled chaos to us. From the outside.. it may look crazy. but to horse and jockey.. it feels like a different dimension. It doesn't seem like chaos to us. I retreat into myself and focus on what's to come. I could be riding a donkey.. and yet I feel I'm the strongest. It's life or death. The inner courtyard is beautiful because you're in a bubble away from the Piazza del Campo. Outside, people are waiting to cheer or judge you. It's like a bullfight. We're like bulls entering the arena. Everybody has expectations of me... me and my colleagues.. I mean. The line-up is determined by luck. This mechanism was invented to ensure absolute secrecy. Once the horses come out.. the tube is opened and the line-up is written down. If you have a bad position between the ropes, if you end up in the last positions, your chances of victory greatly diminish. Ram. She-Wolf. Tower. Porcupine. Unicorn. Owl. Goose. Wave. Slowly.. Owl, slowly. No kicking. Panther go in. Slowly.. slowly. Run-in-jockey, whenever you want. The start of the race is determined by the last horse entering known as the run-in-horse. He decides who'll have a good start or a bad start. The run-in-jockey will probably have his enemy between the ropes. His aim will be to catch his enemy unprepared. Between the ropes, I kept my eye on my enemy.. Tower. He had a better position in the line-up. Run-in-jockey stay still! Turn around, Goose. Guys.. calm down. Get in.. Unicorn. Everybody out! When it gets chaotic the starter will send them all back out. They'll all go to the run-in-jockey to bid money in return for favors. The Palio is a game of legitimate corruption. Without corruption, there's no Palio. All jockeys are corruptible. We give our jockey money to spend. The richest district spends the most. The jockey who bids the highest should get the best start. Unicorn. Owl.. don't push. Don't push. Easy, easy. Unicorn.. you are fifth. Find your position. Unicorn.. go back to your position. Run-in-jockey stay still. Come on, get in there, idiot! Who's the run-in-jockey, Murtas? Maggot! Murtas is the run-in-jockey. He's in cahoots with Bruschelli. Bruschelli does what no other has done.. not even Aceto. He's created a network of absolute power. Go big.. Murtas. He comes from that stable, just as I did. It's only his second Palio, and he's the run-in-jockey. Perhaps too much responsibility for him to handle. So he looked for guidance from his master. It's a false start. The run-in-horse was still far from the ropes. Unicorn started before the run-in. Unicorn called the start. Clearly it was Gigi's strategy. Ram. She-Wolf. The Palio is a battle. Between the ropes, that's who I truly am. All your aggression and courage comes out. We are Goose. We are different. We are the strongest. No, no, no. We won with our heart. Giovanni, you're great. It's hard to explain the feeling. You work all year long for those 90 seconds. If you are in front, it seems never-ending. But if you are at the back, it's over in a second. I got the Casato bend wrong. That's when I went for it. My enemy was on the inside. If I don't get this right, even though we've been friends for years.. the Goose people will chop me up. An incredible Palio. A beautiful race. Gigi Bruschelli was nowhere to be seen. Giovanni was really on fire. He wasn't there just to take part. He was there to be the champion. He was a gladiator.. unlike the other jockeys. He wasn't there for the money. He was there to be number one. # Thank you.. Mother of Mercy # # Protect us from the enemy # # And at the hour of death.. let us rise # it's all or nothing. I'm not interested in mediocrity. It's all or nothing. I must win both Palios now. July was an important step. But August could make my career. You don't get used to losing and you don't get used to winning. You don't always get the horse you want.. but if you are a professional.. you have to deal with it. Good morning.. Silvano. Giovanni, take Federico for a ride with you. Federico.. come here so you can learn something. Watch closely and learn. Stay with him, Federico. Keep together. Go.. Giovanni! Giovanni.. he was trying to push you in the ditch. Fede, why were you pushing him to the side? No.. I wasn't. Now he's claiming he couldn't see you. He wanted to kill me before the August Palio. Someone paid him to do that. Giovanni, have a slice of tart. No.. thanks.. just the coffee. Just a slice of tart. - No, thank you. You were like a gladiator in this great Palio. - Something never seen before. Never seen before? Not like that.. never. Someone who parries with the whip, with the horse.. with the hand, you fought, you overtook your enemy on the inside you blocked the riderless horse and She-Wolf's horse with your hand. It was an amazing Palio, but I have to say it was different from the Palios of the '70s and '80s when I was a jockey. These days you have to deal with a jockey like Bruschelli who is almost at the end of his career, so I believe it was quite simple for you. While I had Aceto, Canapino.. Cianchino.. Pesse. The only one you had to beat was him. Am I wrong? If you say so, but I wouldn't dare say it. Who should I watch out for in August? Gigi. Gigi, he is a man with a mission. Good afternoon.. how are you? Gigi Bruschelli trains some of my horses. And that's what's sort of happens in this area. Trainers tend to be jockeys. This is Osama. This is Montego. And that's Mocambo. Mocambo. He's the shyest one. Despite the fact that I've had wonderful horses for 25 years.. I've never won. The Palio, it's a game played by people where the horse is the unknown element. Everything else is something that humans can trade. They can trade positions, they can trade favors. But they can't get inside the horse's mind. It's a desperate attempt to control fate. I've known Gigi forever. He understands horses better than any jockey before, let alone the strange game that the Palio is. All jockeys make a horse wish list and this list goes to the captains, but they only consider Gigi's list. He decides which horses should be selected and where certain jockeys should ride. Then there's the issue of the horses. Naike.. Lo Specialista.. Morosita. There'll be yet another Bruschelli-trained horse. You already know which you'd like to mount and you don't have to tell me. Which horse would you go for in August? Among these ones? Morosita. As you saw in the July Palio.. Morosita is a strong horse. Remember.. she was the run-in-horse. At the San Martino bend.. she was third. She's a good horse. Now you've got the bit between your teeth, don't let go. As soon as you relax.. the others are ready to... - Do you know what I mean? Perfectly. Work hard and keep on doing what you did in July 'cause this job doesn't last long.. but as long as it lasts, keep hammering. Gigi's very, very focused. He has won 13 Palios in 16 years. I hope that he wins again and matches Aceto.. but it's not easy. My second and third victories were with horses I trained. There are too many photos to get them all in frame. Too many? Not at all. There aren't enough. I need to get on with it to get more photos. You need a couple more photos? "A couple"? I need more than "a couple". I don't think "a couple" are enough. Because I feel I can go on. To beat the record? - Just because I feel like it. Gigi will want revenge in August. No doubt.. goddamn it. It's going to be a battle. No doubt. No doubt. Are you scared? - No, I'm not scared. Age is on my side. The others should be afraid of me. That's what I honestly think. But cut that. He's at the end of his career.. you're at the beginning. At 28, I'm in my prime. - Don't you think? Yes. Come on, we have to go. Let's go and get ready. He was cheeky after the Palio. He was so happy, he jumped off the sofa. He cut his forehead and they had to stitch him. - Where's dad taking you? - To the seaside. Where? - The seaside! - Listen. What do you want to be - when you grow up? - A jockey. A jockey? You're crazy! No, please.. little one. Do you ever put him on a horse? Always.. his horse is Guess. - Who's your horse? - Guess. Let's go to the seaside. Gimme the keys. Where will you put them? Let's hitch up your T-shirt. To the seaside! Come here.. Gina. My friends are in love with you. You have beautiful daughters. He said something different. You're all in love. All in love? - With Gina. - This better not be true. - No.. no.. no. No.. no.. no.. no.. no. Keep your distance! Here are photos of him as a boy. This is Giovanni. when he'd just started out. When I was little, we were not well off at home, so we'd go to the local races.. desperate to put food on the table. Is Giovanni a hero for you? A hero? I would've preferred him to get two degrees. We'll see if he's a hero in 20 years. What do you mean? It's just a job.. I was a builder, he's a jockey. A hero is when you save someone. He's just saving himself. Trying to survive. He was lucky to have the best teacher. That's right, we owe a lot to Bruschelli. The Palio doesn't work the way you think. So we have to thank him and all the people who've helped him. Bruschelli... Do you think he'll become like Bruschelli? I don't think so, they have different characters. Giovanni's an introvert but he's tough when he needs to be. Oh, yes. What will you do this afternoon? I don't know. They don't understand the risk they're taking. I told them.. you need a minimum of 70,000 Euros to control the run-in-jockey or else they'll screw you over. Gigi rides for a high price and uses some of that money to pay other jockeys. We're in favor of change and against the power. Against the power, but... Don't tell me you're in favor of Gigi's power? I'm not a fan of Gigi himself, but I like the way he wins. Everything's unfolding according to his strategy. You can see it by which horses are selected and which horses are rejected. How about the horses? Well.. there's 32 to choose from and we only need ten. Are there good ones? The level is not very high mainly due to inexperience. If he wins on Friday.. it's the umpteenth proof he's controlling everything. As long as you're criticized.. as long as you're the talk of the town, it's good.. it means they care.. so I welcome it. Shell. Bruschelli is going to win, big time! He must think Shell has the best horse, even though it's Oppio's first Palio. This is Oppio, a six-year-old grey, born in my garden in Siena. He is destined to run the Palio. I created him especially for this little game. The Palio. I'd like him to do well, but not to win because he won't get to run the Palio again if he wins straight away. In Siena.. the fastest horses are rejected. That's the way it is. It's all absurd in Siena. It's dysfunctional. If your horse is too fast.. it's rejected. If your horse is too slow, it's rejected. So they're going for mediocrity. Captains prefer mediocre horses because if all the horses are equal, then the money deals prevail. Gigi has benefited from deals rather than from good horses. - What's your horse like? - What's my horse like? - He's a horse. - Holy Mary. But what's he like? - He's a horse. - I know he's a horse. A good horse.. but a beginner. He's never run the Palio. The best Palio jockey could've chosen any horse he liked. He chose this one, there must be a reason. The district also happens to have a lot of money to spend. Whoever has the money will win. That's why he's gone to Shell! Why didn't he ride for Shell in July? Why didn't he? 'Cause they had Morosita.. and he doesn't like her. There are two schools of thought. Either you go for strategies, like Gigi does or you choose to ride a good horse. Wave. This horse could make all the difference. When I saw she was allotted to Wave, I called them immediately to go and ride for them. People have been saying.. "He's good.. but he only wins for Goose. " This really bothers me. So this August, I'm going to go for it. They'll all help Gigi and leave us alone. I'm not happy that we've got Murtas. Murtas is a footstool. He's there to block people for Bruschelli. The jockeys are both good and bad protagonists. The horse is loved and the jockey is hated and sometimes hate is not just verbal. There are infamous events from the past. Jockeys were meat to be butchered. If you lose and your enemy wins.. you're considered corrupt. When Bruschelli won his first Palio for Goose.. I was riding for Tower so my enemy had won. I was quickly smuggled into a building.. but the people saw where I went. I grabbed two big kitchen knives. It's the truth. Come on, you were paid off. Your sister was paid off. The police came to rescue me at 10pm. Even though I was protected.. there were 100 people against us who assaulted me as soon as I got out. It's part of the game. When we rode people spat on us. It means that you scare them. If nobody spits at you.. you're worthless. The jockey is just a mercenary. A person with no patriotism.. no boundaries... nothing. The Palio is my passion.. but for them, it's just work. They're like prostitutes. Once the jockey wins the Palio, you throw him away. The horse is the core element of the Palio. Eagle. Everyone thought Bruschelli was going to ride for Eagle. The thing about Bruschelli is that I didn't quite trust him.. even though he always said he'd ride for Eagle and I gave him a bit of money. When I went to speak to him.. he said.. "If you get a good horse I'll ride for you. " - What happened? - He knew our horse, Naike, hadn't trained for 20 days. He knew 'cause he trains that horse. Yes, Naike's from his stable. And your jockey.. Gingillo, how did he behave? The first time he tried her.. he said she was unfit. He confirmed that the horse hadn't been ridden for a long time. Not since the last Palio. Relationships don't count. Why would a jockey enter an untrained horse? Palio strategies. If I bring a horse knowing he's untrained, I know his condition, but others don't. There's an underworld. A hidden layer of secrecy. Gigi is obviously the favorite. Nicchio are spending a lot of money. Gigi is very clever and I'm sure has organized himself very well. One the face of it, that's who's going to win.. but, you know... It's all those attempts to control fate. But Gigi has not got the best horse. No. He's got to do everything else. So if he wins without the best horse.. from a bad position.. it's pretty suspect. If he does all of that, it's not suspect, it's brilliant. It's the opposite. It's exactly what they pay for. I've never set foot inside the cathedral. I've often gone past it with my wife, but I will only go in if I win an August Palio. It's said that the August Palio is the most important because the jockey is taken to the cathedral. Statistically speaking, the jockey who wins in July is unlikely to win again in August. # We're the ruler of the sky In the Piazza we'll be first # # We're the most beautiful # # And have no equal # # Our cock is the biggest in the world # I don't think Gigi took me for a ride. It was predictable behavior. Naike, go and return victorious. We're going to win tonight. I just have that feeling. You took drugs last night! Goose. Caterpillar. Wave. She-Wolf. I heard She-Wolf has two million to spend on the race. But I don't think they'll win. Tortoise. Tower. Shell. Eagle. Snail. Stay calm. Run-in-jockey, stay still. Move further down.. Eagle. Go in.. Snail. Gigi? Gigi got 200,000 just for riding. Screw your money, you rat! Come on! Out.. out.. out.. slowly. Go out slowly. Giovanni is trying to do a deal with the run-in-jockey. But it will be difficult to buy favors because Wave spent all its money last year paying Gigi to win. Tower. Shell. Eagle. Stay calm. Goose. Run-in-jockey, whenever you want. Attention. Keep quiet. Keep quiet. Get ready. Come on. Run-in-jockey.. first warning. Be quiet. Be quiet. Be quiet. Gigi is spending a lot of money between the ropes. Look at the space he has on either side. These favors cost a lot of money. Run-in-jockey, come on! Second warning! Wave is going to win. Giovanni Atzeni is winning his second Palio this year. This never happens! The Wave has won. Giovanni Atzeni has won again. Both Palios this year! I saw from above that I'd realized my dream. I dreamed of winning both Palios at 28. I did it. Am I dreaming? Am I going to wake up? It was incredible. Then the cathedral. It was my first time. I vowed to only go in when I won in August. It took me ten years. It's upsetting when you lose the Palios you should have won. The ones you'd won on paper. If you don't succeed in those, it hurts. What about Giovanni? He thanks you for bringing him here. That's true, he was just 17 when I saw him riding on the neck of a horse. I was impressed by something he had. I thought he could prove his worth and become somebody. It must have been a dream for Giovanni and for the Sienese too to see a young man pursue glory rather than money. The young must go forward. They can't be satisfied with a few crumbs from the oldies. A new King of the Square is born. Giovanni Atzeni is the heir to Gigi Bruschelli. Let's hope for the districts it won't be a dictatorship but a revolution. Now starts my real job. Were you known as The Farmer? I still am. It's my job.. I'm a farmer. They are true professional jockeys. Unlike me.. I worked the land. It's what I did and still love doing. Few jockeys have ever won two Palios in one year. I'm the youngest to achieve that. Many more victories lie ahead of me.
