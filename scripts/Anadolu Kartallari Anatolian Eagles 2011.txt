Two undefined aircraft, risk of air space violation. Real situation. - Have a good flight. - Thank you. Cobra 6-6-, single group, two contacts. Bull's eye 1-8-0,50 miles. 16,000 feet. They're to the north east. Number one! 1-8-0,50 miles. 16,000 feet. Locked to the front. Number two. Locked to the back. Cobra 6-6! Intense clouds in the area. 5,000... 10,000 feet. Be on your guard. Cobra 6-6. Zenith! VHM instructions. The risk of air space violation by undefined aircraft is over. Return to the base. Zenith, Cobra six six. Instructions received. We're going back. The Tower of Galata fell in love with the Tower of Leander. But couldn't declare his love. The Tower of Leander was actually in love with him too. It was love from a distance. They burned with love, each right where it was. The Tower of Galata could no longer take it... ...and wrote a letter. Hezarfen took the letter. Let himself drop off and glide... ...from the Tower of Galata to the Tower of Leander. But the words of love were so heavy that he couldn't carry the letter. He dropped it in the sea. - And the Tower of Leander... - So what if he couldn't fly? Was he supposed to fall into the sea himself? Well, he didn't. He made his dream a reality. Ahmet. I'm scared. Don't be. Stay by my side, Burcu! - Everything will be alright, don't worry. - Onur. Ahmet Onur. Come now. I just can't get used to "Onur". You and mom can keep calling him "Ahmet". Good luck. I'm really tense right now. - Calm down. We'll all make it. - I'm really scared of this, you know that. - What was it? - Six Gs. I'm exhausted. Well done, it's going really well. Let's continue. Now! - Up to 7 Gs. - Now. Ol! Ol, mate! That was great, man! Cadet! Is this an arena? I apologize, sir. I'm ready, sir. Increasing from 300 knots to 350, increasing to 400 knots. And I make a 30 degree tilt. Nice. Limits are OK. We can continue. At 30,000 feet. You can open your masks on the right and start the test. We write on the consoles. Let us see your faces. If you start to feel bad, you can put your masks back on. Cadets! How are the flight inspections going? Thank you, sir. We'll join you, God willing. Are you going to be a Turkish Star? If it's my good fortune. Here, for good luck. We have a show tomorrow. Come and watch. Thank you, sir. What is this, girl? Eleven, thirteen, eighteen. Why don't you look at your own paper? Anything wrong with my paper? The numbers are correct but it says "Ahmet Omur". That's not Omur, dear. I wrote Onur, I guess my hand shook. Yeah, right, I'm sure it did. Twins! Have a look here, what does it say? - Our eyes are still cloudy. - Too bad, 'unfit to fly'. Come on, don't joke around. Burcu, you have a look. Tell me. - No, no, there's no problem. - Phew! I almost got eliminated, man. My nose was too full. I'm having a sunus operation next week then I'll come back for the physical. Too bad. I hope it goes well. It's called sinus, not sunus, snot-nose. Who'd make you pilot with this nose? They said, "First go blow your nose." Snot-nose! They're flying barely a meter apart. What's going on, man? What is this?! Just look at them. You're hardly any different. Everything is electronic in the F-16. Even a child could fly it. If you trust your wrists, come and fly an F-4, like me. - You'll see. - I'll see, I'll see, God willing. You're quiet. Where did you disappear to? I'm wondering where you'll disappear to. When the physicals are over, you'll go to lzmir and I'll stay in Istanbul. - Sometimes... - It's not far, Burcu. We'll see each other. I've seen how you look at planes. From now on, you'll be in the sky and I, on the ground. Isn't that being apart? It's not. It's just that time will be passing at different speeds for the two of us. When time passes differently, doesn't life pass differently, Ahmet? Hlya. Hlya. Alright, alright, come. If the best student in the school gets eliminated like this, we're in real trouble. Ahmet Onur. Aye Diner. Mustafa Hzarc. Tun Szeri. - Cadet Hzarc. - Cadet Diner. - Cadet Onur. - Cadet Szeri. Suitable for piloting. Your turn to guard the banner of the Air Force Academy student corps. Its color is the color of the sacred blood of the ancestors. Its fabric is the skin of the fallen soldier. Its shine is the light of victory. Its crescent and star are freedom and independence. Its pole is the will of the nation. Its thread is honor and responsibility. The Turkish nation entrusts all these things to you. I hand over this great responsibility into your care. Hold it tightly in your iron grip. Hold it high, always, until the last drop of your blood. Until you hand it over to the next survivor... ...you shall not breathe your last. This banner shall, for generations and forever, be handed over from one... ...to the next and always wave in the skies. Guarding the banner is the most honorable, the most sacred among guard duties. I kiss this noble banner as sign that it is unblemished... ...and as pure as when I received it... ...as I now hand it over to you. We got to see this wonderful day. Yes, we did. They grew up, made lieutenant, and now they'll become pilots. I still can't believe it. Your father must be even more proud of you now, dear. Burcu, where are you studying? At the conservatory. You would get along really well with Mehmet, then. He does marbling at home. Come visit if you're ever in lzmir. We live in Foa. They're both retired... at home all day. So they invite everyone they meet. Sweetheart, listen to you! For God's sake, now. As if we were inviting people out of boredom. Don't worry yourself. Good thing they're letting you come back after your operation. Even if the hills are A thick curtain along the way We're fearless eagles In these limitless skies As this intoxicating speed Overflows out of our chests We shall be in the sky A star that shines bright There's no fear in our hearts Our wings are made of steel We do not fear hurricanes We're the Air Force Academy I brought the operation patient. Man, I got really scared that they wouldn't take me because of the snot... ...that you wouldn't get in. You barely made it, huh? Cut it out. Lieutenants. Are you ready to fly? Always! Burcu, good bye. Wish us luck. And don't worry about Onur, I'll watch over him. I'll come. Alright. Have a good flight. - Well, see you. - See you. I'm sending you off into the sky. Say hello from me. And you take good care of Istanbul. I'll come every chance I get. This door is the beginning of a new life for you... You're going in, and I'm staying here. Don't speak like we're breaking up. You asked me to stand by you, and I have. But, see, I have to go back from here. The connection we have will keep us together, Burcu. Come now. Don't ever take this off. You will see... ...that the endless sky is the pilots' earth. You will fly... ...feeling that the fate of the country is at your fingertips. What you are going to learn is not how to fly... ...it's how to write in the sky. Because we write in the sky. To write in the sky is a lot harder than writing in water. No one knows it. No one sees it. But we... ...live it. While you fly, you will read what those before you wrote in the sky. You will write the rest yourselves, with your wings. I kiss you all on your foreheads, and wish you success. Lieutenants... ...Welcome to the ili Base! Sir! Attention! I see you all feel very proud. Any of you want to get wings and take off? Anyone want to take one of these planes and fly, right now? No one? Me, sir! Now hang on, caterpillar. And when did you get out of your cocoon and become a butterfly? Ahmet, what did you do?! What did I do? He asked and I answered. You were bellowing, man! You almost burst your lungs. Leave me alone! Tell me, why do they call you the twins? We're childhood friends, sir. We grew up together. Good. Let's see how many of these wings will drop off and how many be pinned on? A few will be left but ours will be pinned on, sir. Look here, lieutenants... ...either you fly out of here as pilots... ...or you have no talent, your makeup is not suitable to fly... ...and you get eliminated. Or else... ...may God protect you! Sir, I'm going over to straight flight over Yamanlar at 5,500 feet. Then, while crossing exercise zone number 12... ...I start climbing for number 15. After releasing the landing gear and positioning the flaps... ...I drop my speed to 120 knots. As the speed increases, I add gas. At the beginning, I cross the horizon straight. As soon as I cross the horizon, I lift and start a tilt. I suspect a bird damaged the engine. I'm checking the engine meters. I'm cancelling my climb to the work zone. I do a retirement manoeuver and flip sides. With three or four Gs and no tilt. The altitude below the work zone... I'm going to ask you something. If you answer correctly, I'll let you fly immediately. Yes, sir. But if you can't, you won't fly until you give me the correct answer. What did you fly first? A T-41 D training plane, sir. Are you sure? No flying for you until you answer correctly. Bro... ...didn't we fly T-41s? He asked, "What did you fly first?" - Wasn't it a T-41? - Yes. So? I continue the descent. Karaku? Lieutenant Karaku. What would you do? Sir, I would immediately turn up the gas levers... ...and execute the by-pass procedure. I first want to talk about the weapon acquisition systems. The reason is that it is a little heavier than other plane models. Bravo. Bravo. Bravo. Come on. Towards eleven o'clock. Come on. Go ahead and execute a roll to the left. Brother, shut up already! Didn't we all fly T-41s? Is he making fun of me? After that... ...continue with turbo 0-0. Jump! Jump! Jump! - Where do you want me to jump, man? - Stop, I was just kidding. Where do you want me to jump, shall I jump on you, then? You hear their voices, don't you? Everybody's flying, I'm on the ground. What? Why? Why are you on the ground? My instructor. He's a maniac! He asked me a question and said no flights until I answer correctly. And d'you know what he asked: "What did you fly first?" We all flew T-41s first. I don't get why he's being so annoying. But he didn't ask what plane. Could it be a kite? Yes! Yes! Come. Sir. A kite! Come on then, good luck. Pressure is normal between 10 and 45. I would stop the right engine. I wouldn't start it again. Lieutenant Diner! - Lieutenant Diner. - What would you do in that situation? Sir, before stopping the engine, I would pull the gas lever and check that the oil... ...distribution was within acceptable limits. If not, I'd stop the engine. I'm canceling your flight for today. Write the limits for oil distribution a thousand times. I want it on my desk in the morning. Why are you writing it out, mate? Just put dittos. Are you this dumb? Wow. Check out this girl, mate! Nice bike, too, buddy. Just my type. Sure, now that you have an engine, too, it will be even more fun. What bike, bro? I have a plane, a plane! Here you go, mister clerk. Thanks. A thousand is just too much. If I had known, I'd have given the wrong answer too. We'd both be writing. Alright, we know, you're good at theory, but you know it's all in the wrist. Let's see who's going to get to fly alone first. You think? Write this down somewhere then. Come on, let's make room here. Darling... ...l've missed you a lot too... ...but, honey, how can I get out of here? My parents are right here in Foa and I haven't even seen them yet. Please. What are you doing standing here like a guard? Maybe I'm writing a love letter. To your instructor? A thousand times was not enough for you. If you don't make pilot, at least you'll make calligrapher, don't worry. I love you very much too. Alright, good bye. Was that Burcu? - So why are you in such a state? - Don't even ask. She wants to come because I can't get out. She's right, of course. The thing is, we wouldn't be able to see each other properly anyway. They said that Flight School would be tough but I didn't expect this much. Is that what's bothering you, Onur? Ask her to come on a weekend. You'd get to see her for at least a few hours. You're right. - What were you doing? - Who? Us? Mustafa? That's Mustafa the calligrapher now. Come on, then. Let's practice spins. You take the commands. Copy that, sir. I have the commands. I'm planning a spin from the left. Lever all the way back. Full to the left. Let's go. Copy that, sir. - Welcome, sir. - Thank you. - Thanks. May your work go smoothly. - Thank you, sir. May your work go smoothly. - Nice that it's over. - Thank you, sir. - How was it? - Good. Haven't you forgotten something? The chief worked all night just so you could fly for half an hour. Go shake his hand and thank him. Come on! But I'm canceling your flights. - Where are you going? - To the parachute room, sir. Take the plane, go up, practice a little. Sir, am I going alone? Did I get my first solo flight? Come on, don't ask too many questions. Just do as I say. - Thank you, sir. - Well done. Thank you, sir. My guy almost got his first solo but blew it at the last minute. I'm going on my first solo flight. ili Tower, Scorpion 2-3 first solo. First approach. Latest wind? Scorpion 2-3 solo, wind 10 knots from 0-40. You're first in line, free for descent. Come on, girl. Hold the nose. Come on, you can do it. Don't stay low, Aye! Catch the line. Well done. A little more. Come on, girl. Come on, girl. Hold the nose. Don't drop speed. Well done, girl. She did it, man! Phew! Scorpion 2-3 solo. She went solo before you, mate. What do you say about that? Sir, let her do push-ups too. Push-ups! Push-ups! One, one, one, one, one, one. You're head over heels in love, just admit it. Sir, let me get you wet a little, too. What happened? Alright, alright. You went on one solo flight and now you think you're a pilot? Mustafa, the first solo, I'm telling you, the first solo. You just got to kiss this wrist. Let your instructor kiss it when you've gathered up your parachute. Some kid was flying with his instructor. Whatever happened up there, they jumped out of the plane. While they were gathering up the parachutes the kid went to his instructor and said... ..."Sir, have I been eliminated now?" Come on, now! So, what else do you do? We're just learning to fly. I keep dreaming that I'm in the cockpit. Really? I keep dreaming that you've just jumped out of the plane... ...and are gathering up your parachute on the ground. - Look here. - Just kidding. God forbid. Ahmet, what do you dream of? Just flying? There's a life on the outside, too. You know that, right? Life here is very different, Burcu. Life outside the school doesn't exist anymore. There's nothing but life on the ground and life in the sky now. - They each feel very different. - How so? Tell me. One understands while flying. When I'm flying I feel like I belong to the sky. But it's not like that on the ground. I become a stranger. I become strange. You can't understand. No, I do understand. Burcu, Onur was assigned an instructor, Captain Kemal. You got to see him. A really weird guy. That's why he's gone strange. Don't pay attention to what he says. The guy flew 8 hours straight in Bosnia, just stopping to tank. I think that's why he has kind of lost a few screws. Anyone's world would change if they flew that much. I see. It's time to part again. Burcu, we're not parting. I'm just sending you off. Don't you miss flying while you're on the ground? How can I not miss it? Well, that's just how I miss you. Have you ever thought, as you were getting off the plane after a flight... ...that this might have been your last flight? I don't even want to think about it. I'll be thinking about it the whole way back. The bus to Istanbul is leaving! All Istanbul passengers on board! Burcu, please don't do this. Think about the day you'll come back. Go so you may come back. And may you be me so you understand love. Look I'm making a new one. How is it? Looks like an eagle. Are you making it for me? Take it if you like it but I'm going to make something else for you. I've been thinking about it for a long time. Where's Aye? Aye went to school, mom. She sent her regards. Why didn't you bring Burcu? The poor girl came all the way here, she could have stayed a while. Come on, mom. She just happened to come. Next time, I'll tell her and she'll stay. Son, you're neglecting us but she has come all the way here just to see you. Don't you dare ignore her. You're right, dad, but I must keep focused. So, it's hard. Of course it's hard. You're going to fly. Slow down, slow down, how many times do I have to tell you... ...not to eat so much before a flight? You'll end up vomiting on my head. Take it. I'm full anyway. Man, this is that moped. Wait a second. But where is she? Come on, man, you're not planning to go after her when you have a flight, are you? Pray that she may see your brother in a cockpit after a flight. See what's going on. Understood, sir. In work zone number 4... ... we'll practice Cuban 8s and clover-leaf acrobatics. Go on, then. I want my wafers. Tun vomited in the air. Run. Run, run. May your work go smoothly. What are you doing? I just landed the plane. I'm doing the final checks before returning it. I know how it is. Have a wet wipe. May your work go smoothly. I'm here for a master's degree. I'm writing my thesis. I applied to the Air Force. They accepted. I'll be talking to you soon. Why? Is your thesis about us? In a way. I'm researching the effects of flight instruction on the psyche. You should speak to Onur. You won't find anybody else who thinks he's gonna fly as soon as he sees a plane. Did you buy this helmet like this, or did you get it painted? I painted it myself. Would you paint mine, too? Wait a minute. First become a pilot. Let's see these final checks. Here's someone who does their final checks. What's up? What's the matter? Why are you all staring at me? Nothing. I'm not staring. Don't involve me in this. Hello. Welcome. Would you like a wafer? I won it in a bet. So you made a bet, too?! The warning lamps lit up. The right engine stopped. Turning off the gas lever. Bee three three solo, don't turn off the gas lever! Don't turn it off, understood? Copy that. Turning off, sir, are we agreed? Negative, negative. Don't turn it off! The engine is running. - Why cut an engine that's running? - Alright. Turn on the lights. You heard how a panicking man can make the simplest errors. This is your last plane. You're very close to graduation. I don't have to make pilots of all of you. Some are being eliminated for very simple mistakes. Get a grip on yourselves! Lieutenant nal, I'm canceling your flights until further notice. - Lieutenant Szeri! - Lieutenant Szeri. Continue from where he left off. Sir, I would check the pitot tube and the pitot circuit-breaker. Alright, see you later. My name is missing. - It must have fallen off, wait a sec. - No, brother, it's not here. We're all very sad. This is bad news. Tun Szeri. Is this a joke, man? Gave me a heart attack! - I'll make you pay for this. - Very funny. - Go put this on. - Alright, I'm putting it on. - Are you sad? - Sad? My heart jumped out of my throat. Can we practice lazy 8s in formation, sir? Bee 4-2. These young people like pain. Let's practice lazy 8s in exercise zone number 3. That would be good, sir, Tun would need it, too. Sir, we're returning. What happened? Something wrong? Negative, sir. But we have to return. I have the commands, over. Relax, Tun. You can open your mask. Onur, let's return, too. Well done. Your next flight is solo. Sir. I got my solo, man. He couldn't take it anymore. What happened? It's over, Onur! I got eliminated. So that was it, bro. I could only take it this far. How did you get eliminated? How should I know, brother? I just did. I got eliminated. Hello, it wasn't very nice the last time we said good bye. I want to come for the weekend, is that ok? Call when you get this message. Getting eliminated hadn't even crossed my mind. It's very sad, man. Leaving the plane... The last flight... Remember how we used to play as children? ...said "You're it!" So, that you're "it" is true. It does happen in real life. Scorpions in the area. Puma 3-2. According to ili Airfield... ...we're waiting at about 275, What is this?! What is this?! This is what flying is! That's the way to do it. Brother... ...you understand nothing in a jet. It just zips by. But look at this one. It glides, man. Enjoy it to the fullest! This is just for you. Give me five. I'm going to file a petition tomorrow. I'll transfer to helicopters. - That was something! - I fly like a butterfly. You're crazy, just crazy. Come on then, butterfly. You did well to transfer to helicopters. Not everyone can stand jets. Don't say that. Fatih is telling the truth. We'll all miss you. Don't be sad, alright? It's not the end of the world, is it? Calm down. I got eliminated from flying but I'm still in the forces. That's true, man, but your getting eliminated really got to me. I crashed badly. - I'll never forget that moment. - Look here, man. It wasn't in any way your fault. We did the last flight together. And that's it. And you, pick that guy up so I don't have to worry about him. I got him. Come over here. My brother. What a guy! He comforted us. It felt like a piece of my heart got torn out. I saw Tun on my way here. Aye, did you get a chance to look at your questions? Yes. They're at the base. I'll give them to you when we get there. I think your thesis is missing something. You should look into those who got eliminated during flights, too. Lieutenant Onur. Phone call for you. You are expected. My cell phone has been off. I sent a message saying I was coming; you haven't answered in two whole days. Don't ask, Burcu. Tun got eliminated. I was feeling really down. I'm sorry. When are you coming? I'm in the guardhouse. Can you come? You're here? Burcu, I'd really love to but I'm about to go on my first solo flight. I mean, I can't get out until evening. It's just not possible. Your girlfriend? One minute, Burcu. Yes, sir. It's good to breathe once in a while. Go see her, go out a little. I was going to fly... You're off for the weekend. I was really disappointed when you said you couldn't get out... ...and now I can't believe you actually came. Me neither. Look, my instructor even loaned me his car. Is this the instructor who's been after you? I'm beginning to like pilots. I'm so glad you came. I'm glad you came, too. It's so strange, isn't it? You said 'kite' and I went on a flight. Then you showed up and my first solo flight got canceled. You're so mean! It's not like that. You didn't want me to fly but there seems to be a link between me flying and you. Who knows? Maybe there is. Uncle Mehmet. The F-4 is so big that it takes two people to fly it. First of all, there is no one-person F-4. Don't talk with your mouth full. As you can see, it always ends up this way. As if we were driving a car. Alright, we get it, we get it. Burcu, dear, how are your classes? Good, Uncle Mehmet. We're going to Europe for a performance this week. It will be a first for me. I'm a little nervous. Good luck, then, God willing, there will be more. You see? You just keep on quarreling. We quarrel like this, too, actually. You should see cellists and violinists! Burcu, could you give me a hand, dear? There's more in the kitchen. What does Burcu play? The cello or the violin? The cello. Aye, would you pick a lemon? And tell your mother. Alright. Aunt Nee, these lemons are green, it's a shame. Mom. Mom is here. Here I am. The meatballs are ready. Mom, where have you been? - Aunt Filiz' food is delicious. - Your aunt called. - You know how she is, talks non-stop. - Take this. Come and eat, everybody take some meatballs. Have some, she said "everybody". - You're a wonderful cook. - Enjoy, my boy. Aunt Filiz, Mustafa is great at fixing leaky roofs. Let him fix yours while he's here. Oh dear... Here's our tea. Welcome, Filiz. Burcu, come, you're missing his spoiled behavior. He always acts like this in this house. - I didn't do anything. - Cut it out. Aye, you two are the apples of our eyes. Dad, Burcu does modern dance, too. - Really? - Of course. So, you fly too, but in different skies. Yes, but our wings are not made of steel, they're made of love. - You hear that? - That was good. - They're gorgeous. You're great. - Thank you. I love the colors on this one. Here, have it. As a souvenir. Thank you very much. Look, I'm making this one for Ahmet. I'm not done yet. He doesn't know. - Good bye. - See you. Let me move aside. Take care. I'm going on my first solo tomorrow. What a thing! And you're telling us now?! I was hoping for this piece of news. So I'm sending you off to a solo flight? Let me give you a hug. Take good care of yourselves. Yes, Mom? Your dad is ill, we're in the hospital. How are you doing? What? What happened? How is he now? - Mom, I'm coming right away. - Give me the phone. Why did you call him? Son. Dad, what happened? Your Mom got worried. I'm just fine. We're here for a check-up. You have a flight today, right? A solo flight? Alright, see you at home tonight. And I have a surprise for you. Alright dad, I'm going on my flight, I'll give you a call when I get back. Alright. Something wrong, Onur? Sir, I just spoke to my father, he's in hospital. With your permission, I'd like to visit him after my flight. Not after the flight, go right away. We'll fly later. No, sir. I spoke to him, he says he's fine. I'll go after the flight. Alright. Please. Mehmet. Sir. Ahmet Onur's father... Let's let him fly with his dad a little. Push-ups. One. One. One. One. Thank you, sir. - Stop crying, Aye. - How can I stop, Mustafa? I grew up in his hands. We were together just yesterday. Your dad is gone, too, I'm all alone. What'd I do if something happened to you? Don't you worry. I'm not going anywhere. Auntie. Auntie. You're very tired. Come sit a little. Did you see that, sir? He'd said he had a surprise for me. A phoenix. It's wonderful. Burcu? Ahmet, I just received the news. I was in a concert. Aye called and left a message. My condolences. It's really sad. Thank you, Burcu. I feel terrible. I was about to go on my solo. We spoke, I said I'd see him in the evening... ...I didn't even get to see him. Onur. Lieutenant Onur. Come, let's get some fresh air. - Yes, Burcu? - Ahmet, I'm coming. Not now, Burcu, my head is a mess. I'm trying to make a decision. I can be there for you, too. It's really important to me to be with you now. Please let me be by your side. Alright, I'll see you, then. Tell me, what is the maximum wind for a formation take-off? Ok, how long after the leader can you start the peel off? I'm asking you a question, Onur, answer already. I'm canceling your flights, you get your first red, go change your clothes. Onur. Hello, how are you? Don't even ask. Instructor Kemal canceled my flights. He gave me a red. I feel really down. Anyway... Come on, let's forget about it. How are you doing, you ok? I'm fine. I'm going to the workshop. Come along, it'll distract you a little. Look, I'm in no state to fill in a questionnaire, ok? Alright, come on now. That's nice. Give it here. Here you go. Jump now. We can't reach it, let's try again in a while. Alright. I'll wait here. Here we are. Welcome. Wow. Painting too, huh? I just drew these for myself. They're very good. So you still paint helmets? I drew this for my biker friends. Do you like it? It's really beautiful. Great work. I was going to ask you to paint mine, too, but... I think it's too early for you yet. You're right. Don't even know how much longer I'll be flying anyway. Why do you wear this scarf all the time? Is there a special reason? Hmm. It's a present. She took it off her neck and put it on me the first day of Flight School. Why didn't you say anything? Now I'm wearing it, too. - Did you even ask? You just grabbed it. - I'm sorry. Where's your girlfriend, is she here now? She's in Istanbul. Actually, I'm a little upset about that, too. Last time she called, she said she'd come. I told her not to. Do you think I offended her? And you ask, Onur?! Why did you tell her not to come? - Dunno. - Call her right away. - I should, shouldn't I? - Call her. She doesn't answer anyway. You forgot to do your flight checks. We were supposed to do them every 10 minutes but you're still standing there. Bee 4-7, ili Rapcon. Bee 4-7, ili Rapcon. Onur, answer already. The man went hoarse. ili Rapcon, Bee 4-5. I'm listening. Forget it. You can't even say your call name properly. I have the commands. Bee 4-7. Exercise completed, we're returning. Come on then. You got your second red. What is this, man?! It's just too much! Too much. As if he's watching for opportunities. Two reds in a row. That's just cruel! Doesn't he know this guy's situation? He was at the funeral. Onur, what state are you in? Get a grip. Onur, why did we come here? How did we get here? What did we promise each other, don't you remember? Don't look as if you don't understand! What you did is treason in my book! - Come on, Aye! - Mustafa, you stay out of this! Go! Look at me. Didn't we promise each other, when we were tiny? Either both of us would be pilots, or neither of us? Why did we nick our fingers that day? Why did we get a spanking? Did you forget how we balled our eyes out? - Aye! Look, we shed blood, and we shed tears. And we said we'd give up our lives, too, if necessary, didn't we? Look, what you did is treason in my book, Ahmet Onur! Aye, come on! Look, Uncle Mehmet was practically my dad, too. You becoming a pilot was his greatest dream. Instead of getting a tighter hold, you just let yourself go. Is this what you're going to do for your dad? You don't understand, you just don't get it! What is it that I don't understand, Ahmet Onur? Look at me, remember. No one can understand this better than me! Attention! Aim! Fire! Fire! Fire! Attention! Port arms! Look, that's my dad's plane. - What happened to the plane? - It crashed. - What happened to your dad? - He flew. Let me have a look. Come. Sir, I'd like to speak to you about something. Have a seat. Sir, with all due respect... ...I don't think Onur deserved the second red. He took his father's death with great courage. He got it from me. He was ready for it. The real reason is his mother's anxiety. That's why he's not performing well. I still trust Onur. If it had been someone other than Onur, I wouldn't have given them a red. I give him the second red so he'd get a grip of himself. Understand? Sir, I don't know about the first one, but he got the second one on purpose. How do you mean? Sir, they call us twins for a good reason. Whatever he feels, I feel it, too. His mother, you say? What was her name? Nee, sir. Let me tell you a story, Mrs Nee. There was a lazy, good-for-nothing boy who didn't want to go to school. His father sent him to work as a shepherd. One day, the boy came running home. He said to his mother: "Mom, I saw something. It was huge. It was flying." His mother said, "It was a bird." "No, no, There were two people in it." "So it was a plane, and those inside were pilots." she said. "Mom, I want to be a pilot, too." Said the boy. "You haven't even graduated from primary school... How are you going to become a pilot? You'd have to study hard." said the mother. The boy had been really impressed. "Mom," he said, "I promise to study hard, I'll become a pilot. Send me back to school." And? Did he manage to become a pilot? He's standing in front of you, ma'am. What does 'firmament' mean? Sky. Those who fall in love with it are prepared to give their lives for it. It's better to shoot a bird in flight than to keep it from flying. We're training our wing comrades here. Now we're their teachers but they'll be our teachers in the future. So, we're actually training our own teachers here. Mrs Nee, your son has two reds. If he gets one more, that will be his last flight. You may not see him flying again. My son will fly. Do you know who dies first in wars? Those who have no one waiting for them. You understand why as you're flying. You'll be a pilot soon. Make sure there's someone waiting for you on the ground when you fly. I'll remember that. Do you understand now why I asked you what you'd flown first? I think I do, sir. You can't understand. You haven't flown solo yet. Flying exacts a price. In the sky, time gets suspended. On the ground, it flows like water. As you fly, time flows back and forth. You enter a storm... ...you pray for your wings to hold, you shake violently. Five minutes pass like five hours. Then you come face to face with death. Your entire life... ...passes before your eyes, like a film strip. That's why it's not... ...possible to ever forget anybody. Connect to someone. Make sure someone is waiting for you. Or it will follow you all your life. I'm going abroad on a mission. Keep my car. I'll be gone a long time. I want to find it exactly like this when I get back. Hello, Burcu, how are you? I'm fine, too. We're graduating and I'd like to invite you. I'm still wearing your scarf. You don't answer my calls but I never take it off. You never take it off? Are you sure? - Wait, stop. They put them up? - They put them up. Come. Hzarc, Eskiehir. Eskiehir. - I'm really happy. - Me too, man. Konya, brother, Konya! And I was assigned to Eskiehir. The lists are up. Really? Did you check mine? It's F-16, right? Yes. F-16. What's yours? - F-4, of course. - Nice, good luck. Wish Mustafa good luck, too. Good luck. Are we together? Ask your twin. That's the one who checked the list. - F-4. - What? Did you sell me out, mate?! Why? She's just a tiny girl. How is she supposed to fly that enormous plane by herself? - You don't say? - Let it go, for God's sake! Don't make me come over. You asked for it! Come on, come on. This base where the world's bravest pilots get trained... ...was just a beginning. Much tougher training and flights are waiting for you. I hope that all of you join the Eagles of Anatolia Maneuvers... ...and prove me right. You leave this nest as eagles. I kiss you all on your foreheads. Thank you, Sir! Congratulations. You are the first woman to graduate at the top of your class. Keep on working like this. Just between you and me, I fly F-16s too but the F-4 has a special place in my heart. Thank you, sir. To fly an F-4 requires wrists of steel. Well done. Thank you, sir. Tell me now, why do they call you Hairbreadth? I was flying a hairbreadth apart from the leader in a formation flight, sir. Good luck. You'll call me Big Brother from now on. Don't forget what I told you. And take good care of my car. Thank you, sir. I wish your fathers were here to see this. Mom, they are here with us. Why didn't Burcu come, my son? I'm going to Istanbul, mom. - That would be good. - Right. Guys, let's take it from the top. Friends... ...you've all come here, having already learned to fly. Now, you're going to learn to hunt in the sky. Some of you will be trained in F-5s, some in F-4s and F-16s. In the future, the best among you will fly in our own war planes... ...designed by Turkish engineers. The best pilots among you will take part in Eagles of Anatolia... ...our international maneuvers along with the world's elite pilots. That's where we will put into practice all we have learned. In addition, an F-16 is being prepared for an acrobatics show... ...for the hundredth anniversary of the Air Forces. Its name is Solotrk. It may be one of you who gets to fly it. Man, these people are not human. Do you want to apply for Solotrk? I would have considered it if it were an F-4. Shame on he or she who gives up, eh, Mustafa? Why do you speak like that? One for all and all for one. It would suit you, though. An F-16 would suit me but doing a show in the air doesn't suit me. Oh really? I can see how you melt inside when you look at them. Melt? I'm just looking. Besides, I don't wait at their door for autographs. I told you already, it's for my nephew. Right, for your nephew! First lieutenant, you're always one and a half seconds late. Don't slouch, my friend. There are two guys behind you. What are they supposed to do if you keep wiggling? Don't shake the plane. And you! You just can't fly in your own position. You're always at a distance. I keep shaking the wings, saying it over the radio, signaling with my hands. Why don't you come closer? But I did, sir. I came to within two meters. Two meters, hmph. Let me show you just how close you have to get. This is how close. Exactly this close. Alright? Understood, sir. What do you want? Sir, can I have an autograph for my nephew? - Let me have my colleagues sign it, too. - Alright, sir. I'll get it, sir. Will you marry me? May your work go smoothly. What were you doing up there? We're going to dance, right, we were rehearsing for that. What dance, what rehearsal? The first dance at the wedding. Come on now, are you serious? Yes. Phew, man! Finally. I kept saying they'll either shoot each other or make babies together. Take good care of each other. And you take care of yourself. Ankara is close. Come whenever you want. Don't make Aye sad. Don't worry. We've already done everything we had to do. Just let him try to make me sad. Alright. Drive carefully. - See you, then. - Have good trip. Onur, what's wrong? Nothing. Forget it, come on. - Welcome. - Thank you. Our plane is a go, we have no failures. Thank you, sir. I thank you. Man, oh man! What's wrong, Mustafa? You seem to have a lot of trouble. You put the plane into 7Gs, then you push it, and suddenly it's minus 3Gs. You need to adjust your hand, girl. I almost fainted. I did faint. So, how did you pull up the plane? Eh, I came to. Come on, now! Welcome, sir. Good luck. I hear you're both going to the Eagles of Anatolia Maneuvers. - Thank you, chief. Thanks. - Thanks. Yes, who knows, the old team may get together again. Of course, they're in the Daggers. You just wait, I'll show them! I released all the bombs... ...but the canon missiles are not ejecting. If this happened during the maneuvers, it would be really embarrassing. First Lieutenant Onur, we didn't load canon missiles into your plane. What do you mean? How can you forget to load canon missiles? Is there a problem, First Lieutenant? You didn't load canon missiles, chief. How can you be so neglectful? The flight program lists only... ...training bombs as ammunition. There are no canon missiles on it. How can this be? How can there be no missiles in a shooting mission? You just didn't load any. No, First Lieutenant, look for yourself. The program shows only training bombs. There are no canon missiles. Besides, you checked it yourself before the flight. You looked at both the plane and the list. You did, didn't you? If First Lieutenant Onur is always like this, we're in trouble. Look, he's very young still. He's just at the beginning. Such things happen. Don't upset yourself, come on. How can I not come, Aye? I'll wreak havoc at that wedding. By the way, wasn't it in August? Why did you move up the date? To boost morale before the maneuvers. No other reason. By the way, Tun and Fatih were selected, too, you know that, right? Really? Now, that's a boost for my morale. Alright, I see, you're upset. Don't ask, Aye. I unjustly balled out the mechanic when I came back from a flight. Alright, don't be upset. You'll find a way to fix it. We know you. It lived on Magic Mountain. It had a nest in the Tree of Knowledge. It possessed the knowledge of all time. When death arrived... ...it went up in flames and burned itself. But then, it was born again from its own ashes. It was immortal. The Phoenix' only goal was to keep the earth and the sky united. In the end, it found the truth within itself, zlem. Did you ever want to fly? Very much. I'd have really loved to. But... ...as long as they come back in one piece from a flight... ...that's enough for me. Let me see. Good work. This one is really wonderful. Good morning. May your work go smoothly. Welcome, First Lieutenant. Forgive me about that unpleasantness yesterday. Forget it, such things happen. My friends, take a break and have some baklava. With pistachios, First Lieutenant? Come, come. That's the thing. - We have started the day well, my friends. - zlem? Is that you? Onur. - You still haven't finished your thesis? - That thesis got done long ago. So what are you doing here? I'm here, I'm in Konya. I'm an instructor at the university. They liked the master's thesis. Now I'm doing a doctor's degree. Very good. You know about the wedding? Yes. What are you doing, how are you? - I'm fine, what are you doing? - Lieutenant. Mrs zlem. Have some baklava. Enjoy, have some, my friends. Are these with the whirling dervishes new? Yes, sir. Very nice. The symbol of Konya, of course. It's not just because of Konya, sir. People from the four corners of the earth come here every year for the maneuvers. So we tell them to come. Come, whoever you are, come anyway. My father said about pilots... ...that they are the whirling dervishes of the modern era. Because we fly in the sky. For you, it's flying in the sky. For us, "Come, whoever you are, come anyway." While you fly, we pray, First Lieutenant. You can't even imagine how much it hurts to clean out the locker... ...of a pilot who didn't come back. Come on, there are tons of baklava left. Thank you very much, First Lieutenant. Thanks. Don't mention it, chief. Enjoy. This is a very nice car, too. Very handsome... ...but neglected. It breaks my heart to see it like this. Don't ask. I couldn't find a mechanic for it in Konya. The gears don't work, it burns oil. I'm going to Eskiehir for the wedding, I'm worried it'll give me trouble. Let's take my car. Leave this one to us, we'll have a look at it. You know about such cars? Mrs zlem, First Lieutenant, come, I have something to show you, this way. Ms zlem, watch your head. This plane had crash-landed, gone off the runway and burned. The Americans thought it was practically impossible to repair. But we repaired it in Turkey. Chief, that was well done indeed. I feel really proud. We're proud, too. It's going to fly again soon. Burned, repaired. Born again. A phoenix! I'll fly it myself. Where to, Onur? To Eskiehir for the wedding, sir. Good. Have a good trip. Thank you, sir. - How are you? - Fine. Give it to me. I got it. - Move over. I'll drive. - Oh, yeah? - Move, move. - Alright, then. What? You're going to become a doctor now? Now I research the mental state of those who couldn't make pilot. You used to paint helmets and stuff, what happened with that? The doctor's degree is so tough, Onur. I haven't had time to paint or draw for a long time. But you'll paint mine, right? We'll see. What's Burcu doing? Is she coming to the wedding? We haven't seen each other in months. You know... ...you burned me up. Let me introduce you. Elif, my classmate Tun. He'll introduce us a few more times but nice to meet you. How are you? - I'm fine, how are you? - I'm fine, too, thanks. So, what are you doing, search and rescue? How many have you rescued? Just a fisherman and a mountain climber. Mate, everyone's dying to go on missions... ...but I must say we pray not to have to. I see you found the perfect place. It really suits you. Why are you alone, mate? Doesn't your radar work? Look who's coming. Hello. Hi. Welcome. - Thank you. - Welcome. - Burcu. Elif. - Hello. - Hi, nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you, too. You threw us out for being naughty. They won't let us in to the wedding. But they'll let us in thanks to you. You look really sharp. Thank you. Onur is on his way, too. But Aunt Nee and Filiz are inside. Shall we go in? Oh, here they are. - Hello. - Hello. - Welcome. - Thank you. Come now, dear. Ms Aye Diner, do you take Mustafa Hzarc as your husband... ...of your own free will? Yes. Mr Mustafa Hzarc. Do you take Aye Diner as your wife? Yes. - Ready, girls? I'm throwing it! - Yes! What have you been doing? How's it going? I kept busy with classes. Then school was suddenly over. I asked myself, what I had learned from music. So what had you learned? Affection... ...and further, love... ...and the hope of reaching it. What about you? Nothing. What do you mean? Didn't you fly? I flew, of course. But... ...I missed flying when I was on the ground... ...and you while I was flying... One day I came to see you, in Istanbul, at your school. I waited for you. I couldn't come to see you. I couldn't call you. I didn't have to courage. - The scarf you gave me... - I know. Aye told me. But it doesn't matter anymore. I think... ...what matters is the connection between us. I'm like a kite in the sky, Burcu. If I don't have someone waiting for me, holding my line, I'd be swept away. This is my line. Please don't let go of it. Please. Wow, man, we're getting old. How long has it been? No way! These maneuvers have done me a lot of good. Yeah, man, I hadn't felt so excited since my last flight. Here we are all together on the same base. I take you in even though Onur hunted you like partridges. Just don't create extra work for me. - Don't make me look for you in the hills. - Get outta here. Everyone watch their back. I'll show no mercy. He's right, it's true. We'll see. Wow, that was... - Take this. Take this. - Come on, then. Seriously, man, if you are successful during these maneuvers... ...the force commander is sure to give you an award. So who will it be? - I'm sure it'll be me. - Forget it. Come on, let's go. Solotrk is coming. Get moving. Solotrk? - Classmate! What's up? - Just fine, classmate, really well. - Really good. - Wonderful. You saw that, right? Did you see what he did? - Who was it? - We'll wait and see, man. It was Captain Kemal. Didn't you know? Good news! Your instructor is here. Captain Kemal, welcome. - Thank you, mate, how are you? - Fine, thank you. - Let me have a look at the plane. - You must have missed it. - Welcome, sir. - Thank you. What's going on? You're gathered again. What are you doing here? I'm on this base anyway. They are here for the maneuvers. These three joined because I'd be here. So I'm watching out over these guys. Or they'd be hunted down like partridges, sir. I knew I'd see you during the maneuvers... ...but what are you doing here? We came to take a closer look, sir... ...but we had no idea you'd be here. Good, good, enjoy looking at it. You may one day get the chance. Message received, sir. Is your mission abroad over? Are you here for the maneuvers? Yes, it's over. We're in the maneuvers together. So you're flying red, huh? Solotrk? We'll talk about Solotrk later. How's my car? Sir, I have something to do in the hangar. I'll come find you later. We're going to have some tea. Catch us then. Let's go and drink some tea. Sir, how many negative Gs have you reached? May your work go smoothly. - Where's Sergeant-Major Naci? - Back there. Thanks. Chief, chief! First Lieutenant Onur. What happened to the car? Lts owner is here. The car? We knew you'd come. Don't worry. It's in the parking lot. Thank you very much, chief. May your work go smoothly. Wow, you took good care of it. Here, sir, the keys. It looks better than before. Jump in, let's take a ride. What post are you coming back to, sir? I was appointed fleet commander for the Turkish Stars. The fleet commander gave it to me while I was at the Air Force Academy. Actually, my only dream long ago was to join the Turkish Stars. But I kept it a secret. You're the only person I've ever told. Those who bear that secret come here. But it's now enough to want. It depends on the direct approval of the force commander. You're very good, Onur. Strong, free, solitary, like an eagle. But geese fly in formation. Like this. In a V. One is always ahead. The leader. But the leader changes all the time. Even the one at the very back sometimes becomes the leader. If one falls another one is sure to land next to it. It waits until the other has recovered, then they rejoin the group together. Turkish Stars means flying solo... ...with the other planes. Can you fly like that? What did you do? You mean you still fly solo, man? I understood why you asked me about the kite, sir. I gave her my line... ...but she let go of it. Onur! You're joining for the first time. Last year, because we shot everybody down right at the beginning... ...they asked us to take it easy. So we don't push it the first few days. - Let's let them get used to it. Alright? - Copy that, sir. Just as long as they don't shoot us down, sir. Dagger formation, Silk! Two groups blue. Southern group two planes. approaching you, be careful. Tun, what's the situation? Sir, the Reds are approaching from the west and the Blues from the east. The number two in the Dagger formation is Onur's plane. Number one, contact 1-0-0, 50 miles. 25,000 feet. Hot. Number two, maintain your position. Number two, roger that. Dagger two, threat. One o'clock, 10 miles. Blue single group two planes. They're engaging you. Roger that, Silk Number two is retreating. Fox two! Dagger two, congrats, good shot. Blue number one out of commission! Mission accomplished! Dagger two, blue plane in the north engaging you from the right... ... and the one in the south from the left. I'm within canon range. Well done, man. Well done. Good job. You got three blues on the first day. I didn't expect to, either. Without Tun's warning, fatality would be inevidible. That's true. I came to myself when I heard Tun's voice. The guy went right up to the plane and shot it with the canon, man! You seem to be enjoying this. I see you're in a good mood. Look, these guys can't find empty air space. They come from the other end of the globe to get a couple of hours' experience here. They wait all year for these maneuvers. And what did you do? You shot down their leader as soon as you went up. And then two more planes. Leave the guys alone, man. Can you open the first few seconds of John's formation? Onur's retreat. Dagger two, Dagger one! Sneak in behind the blue planes. Just shoot down the C-130 while we take care of the rest. Roger, Dagger two. Leaving formation. Come on, Mustafa. Tilki iki. Onur almost crashed, sir. Show that again. What did you do, man? You almost killed us both. Mustafa, it's alright. Get a grip on yourself. It's over now, pick yourself up, it's over. It's over. They insisted that the bomb must have had a camera. Otherwise it couldn't have escaped two missiles and hit the target. So I told them to go and look in the hangar. Did they really go to the hangar to check, sir? Sir, you should have said the difference lies in the wrist. You keep talking about the wrist but I don't understand... ...how you put up with the pain? Love, zlem! Pure love. You should ask Onur. We were talking about pure love, Onur. We got interrupted. If interrupted, it's not pure anyway, just forget about it. Enjoy your meal. I'm going to take care of this business. This is not the door for the desperate. Come as you are. Onur! Yes, sir! What is this state you're in? Nothing, sir. You know what I did during the last flight. It's over and done with. Forget it! Every flight is the first flight. No, sir, it felt like it was the last flight to me. I can't take it anymore. I'm getting swept away. It seems my lot was to pay the highest price. There's no one waiting for me, sir, no one is waiting. Now, wait a minute. You never know what life is going to show you and when. Thank you. Are you alright, First Lieutenant? The last flight. You're right, of course, you're exhausted. You'll rest a while after the maneuvers. Everyone will talk about the Phoenix. Thanks to you. You did the plane justice. Chief... ...wish me luck. You're struggling in vain. Congratulations, Dagger two. Mission accomplished. The manouvers are over. Silk, Dagger formation speaking! We've accomplished the mission. We're returning to the airfield. We went twice to Dubai. Congratulations, gentlemen, good job. Silk. Dagger two speaking. Emergency. Bird collision at point bravo. Engine not normal. Planning emergency landing. Dagger two, Silk! Do you require checklist assistance? Negative. The engine is working at partial power. I've completed checklist procedures. Alert emergency teams. If you can't make the runway, consider ejecting. Silk, Dagger two. I'm not planning to eject. I'll attempt to land the plane. I'm going to the helicopter, man. That guy's gonna jump! Dagger two, Silk! You're below the safe altitude. Do not delay the decision to eject. Silk. Dagger two is not jumping. Dagger two requests radio silence! Dagger two, How much fuel do you have left? I'm about to run out. Onur. Abandon the plane immediately. I can't, sir. I'm going to try to land the plane. Onur! I repeat. Abandon the plane immediately. Sir, I can't, this is the Phoenix. I can't leave it. Onur, your engine may stop at any moment. Your altitude is insufficient. I repeat. Your altitude is insufficient. Onur, your speed is too high. Pass! Pass! Onur, you're running out of fuel. Jump already! I can't do that, sir. Turn the plane towards the countryside and jump already, jump! I won't, sir. Is there anyone waiting for me? Sir, the engine will stop at any moment now. Either it'll glide down, or... Don't stay low. Don't stay low! Don't stay low! Parachute. Hook down. Alright, stop. Stop already. That was near. - Thank you, sir. - Let me give you a hug. Alright, then. You scared the daylights out of us! - Congratulations, zge. - Thank you. Guys. Did you hear the news? The commander wants to see you. First Lieutenant Hzarc. First Lieutenant Onur. Welcome. I especially wanted to see you guys. You made us proud during the maneuvers this year. Thank you. Your father was my best student. You turned out to be solid like him. Thank you, sir. What are you planning to do from now on? Is there something you wish? Tell me, don't be shy. Sir, with your approval, I'd like to fly Solotrk on October 28th. But Captain Tanaan is scheduled to fly it. No, no. He suggested it himself. I just asked to see if you wanted it, too. - Start to train right away, then. - Sir, yes, sir! I wish you both the best. Thank you, sir. First Lieutenant Onur. Yes, sir. Tanaan wants you in the Turkish Stars, so I just signed the papers. Good luck. Thank you, sir.
