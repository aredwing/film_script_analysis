And the urn? - Put it on the car. - Smile, Monsignore. Dear Michael, we have done a discovery in the cemetery that worries me. I send you this urn to examine the content. Knowing esoteric and paranormal sciencies, I think you'll be able to confirm or deny my fears. Rome, Museum of Ancient Art Excume me, Sara, have you seen Michael? No, since a couple hours ago. He took Paul to the doctor. Oh yes, that's why he doesn't answer the cell phone. Do you want to see a thing? What? Come with me. Come on! What is it? Now you'll see. - I have never seen anything like this. - Really? Don't make me curious. What is it? Well, it's an urn. - An urn? - Yes. - Where does it come from? - From Viterbo. Monsignore Brusca sends it. It was found in a box buried in 1815. Isn't it nice? - I have never seen anything like this. - Neither myself. - It's for Michael. What does it say? Do we open it without him? I don't think he minds. Let's see what's inside and after we put the letter back. - OK. - Agreed. Let' open here. - Shall I help you? - No, I can do it. What harm! You cut, Let me see it. - It a small cut. - An accident. Be cool. - Let's open it - Yes. It's beautiful. Grab the dagger with care.. - It's from the medieval age. - Yeah, thirteenth century. - Three statues, they're creepy. - Yes. Let's see what's this. They seem like demons. Look the inscription. There's one more thing here. It' a tunic, like talisman. Do you understand what's written? Not much well. They're ancient symbols. Sara, do me a favor, go and bring me the Aramaic dictionary. - I'll take a look meanwhile. - OK. Run! Help, help! Let's see, you have seen some people But they were deformed. I didn' see well. - It was strange the way the moved. - Why strange? It was like... they were devouring her, all full of blood. Wait, try to describe it. I saw it for a few seconds. Not all people were deformed? Yeah, there was a monkey. A monkey? It followed me. What exactly do you do at the Institute, Sara? I specialize in restoring archaeology. Have you already catalogued the things found in the box? No, I have not yet been able to examine them. That is all I kno, I wish to go home, please. - Sarah, how are you? - Oh, Michael! I am Michael Pierce, Director of the Museum. Enzo Marchi, I lead the investigation. - I'll take her home. - Sure, no problem. I cant' believe it. She's nuts. - Will you be investigator or not? - Sure. Can I go too? I do not want to be alone tonight. Of course you can. It's freezing outside. Do I light the fire? Yes, I'll take a look to Paul. He's in bed and quiet. He's sleeping. It happened to me one thing really strange this afternoon. It's embarrasing for me to tell you. What is it? Swear you won't say I'm crazy. I swear it. There was something inside there. I was not sure to leave alive. Believe me. - It doesn't matter. - Come on. Tell me. I felt a voice inside me. In my head. And suddenly, BAM!, the doors were opened alone. And they were deadlocked. It was a woman's voice that I could remember. Hey, tiger, what are you doing awake? - Hi, Paul - Hi, Sarah - Do you want a hot chocolate? - Yeah. - Can I read a book? - All right. Get the book and take it to your bed. Which one do you want? This one? I'll bring you the chocolate in a minute. I do not understand why. Why was Giselle killed? What was the important thing in the urn? It was a kind of talisman. Tomorrow I'll see Monsignor Brusco and I hope he'll know something. How do you know him? I took a course on spiritualism. He was a real authority on mysticism and the occult. Do you believe such foolishness? - The occult? - Yes - Well, some things yes, others not. Don't you believe in what we fail to understand? Not really, no. You and I are scientists and must only believe in what we can see and touch. I still hear that voice. It stillI resonates in my head Am I becoming crazy? No, Sarah, stay calm. Just rest. - Good morning, Father. - Good morning. I would like to see Monsignor Brusco. He's not well. He had an attack in the afternoon we discovered the box. He was consciousonly a few minutes before the coma. I'm so sorry. Although this is not the right time, I need information on the box. I can't see the reason why someone could kill for that urn. All I know is that there was a name on the box: Oscar De La Vall. Oscar De La Vall? - Yes. - Do you know who he was? Well, Monsignor believed that the main character was a history of two centuries ago. Many people considered him just a legend. Brusco not. That's why he sent you the urn. For you to confirm. Can you tell the story? En 1815, some workers were restoring the Curia of Aosta, they discovered an urn, Inside there were various objects, including a tunic believed valuable magic. some witnesses said that the tissue began to shine intensely. And packs of wolves emerged from the forest. The wolves removed the bodies buried and ripped them. The local authority ordered to take the urn to the Vatican. Oscar De La Valle offered volunteer to carry it. He was a gentleman of high lineage and had permission to talk with the Pope. It was an unfortunate trip, in its wake, the urn brought death and destruction. Children were dying... In many cities, he was refused to entry. People had panic. When he arrived to Viterbo, he was exhausted and sick. He went to the local Church and in six days died of malaria. He was buried in a secret place with the urn inside the box. The box was sealed with a crucifix. He spoke nonsense. He said things without meaning. Wait... He was writing this when they had the stroke. It is the list of objects in the box. - Mater Lacrimarum - Mater Lacrimarum... Yes. According to Monsignor, the urn and the objects contained were magical. They belonged to a wicked witch called Mater Lacrimarum. The Mother of Tears. What a pity... A man like him... Ending his days believing nonsense. Monsignor should truly believe it. The ways of God werel less mysterious to him. If Monsignor wrote this, some reason should have. Stay calm. Goodbye, Father. Help, help! What happened? They have my son. But, what do you say? They killed the nanny. They left a note. When I arrived I found this. If you want your child keep the SILENCE. The SILENCE. Michael I'm sorry I'm sorry, my love. - These symbols, I saw them on the urn. - I know. They are that people, a sect of black magic. Black magic? Michael, I do not believe that... - Do you think those are a series of coincidences? - I am not saying that. Giselle is dead, Brusco in an coma and they have taken Paul. Everything started with the urn and the talisman. They want me in SILENCE. What is keeping the SILENCE? It is the dark returning to Rome. Don't you realize? It is one thing clear. Come here. Now I will make you see. Wait. An epidemic of suicides, A wave of violence spreading throughout the city... Murder, arson, rape, vandalism... Michael, you are scaring me. I'll bring the box to Father Johannes. How do you think that this Father can help? He is an exorcist, one of the last recognized by the Vatican. He knows all about the occult and he will help me to find Paul. - Why don't you go to the police? - But what Police! Didn't you see how they treated you at the Museum? Like if you were nuts. Michael, I also want to find Paul but I do not think that this is appropriate. Paul is my son, Sarah! Not yours. Three furies. Three graces Divinity with three heads. The Triad Why they are always three? Hello. - Sarah, it's Michael. - Michael, where are you? - No, wait, listen... - I need your help, Sarah. - Sure, tell me what I should do. - Yes, look... - Michael? I'm not listening, nothing. Sarah help me, help me. Concentrate! They won't be able to see you. We lost her Sarah Mandy killed this guy because she was been followed. Miss Mandy weighed about 50 kilograms and that type was a kind of gorilla. And he was armed. I dont think she was Take him. Good morning, I am looking for a friend, Michael Pierce. He came to meet Father Johannes. No, sorry, he's not here. What!... Could I see Father Johannes now, It's very important. Maybe he'll come back tomorrow, he had a lot to do. Tomorrow is impossible. Please, I swear That it will not be long. It seems that you have done a tiring journey. I met your mother. You are Elisa's daughter, Mandy. Is it truth? My name is Marta Colussi. You really look like her so much. I met your mother many years ago. In Germany From her I learned so much. She was a great teacher, a great spititualist. The best that I have ever met. My mother was a dancer. She was a good actress. A white witch. And from your father, you have inherited some of his talents. - But what dou you say? - Call me Martha. I did not come here to talk to you. Leave me in peace, understood? How could you escape at the station? But... what do you say? Elisa gave you a hand. She guided you. Didn't she? I don't know. I've felt... a voice. Did you really know my mother? Fairly well. You do not know much of her, right? Not. I remember very little of her. I was a childl when she died. In the accident at Freiburg. No, dear, I am sorry, it wasn't that way. Your parents were killed. What? It is not possible. Nobody told me that. What do you know? Your mother battled a powerful Black witch. Mater Suspiriorum. The Mother of Sighs. The Mother of Sighs? Father Johannes, how many drops? Twenty, thank you. You're not well, you should rest. I cannot with what is happening! Take the drops. I have waited for you a long time. - Are you Sarah? - Yes. Their existence is a new world you do not know. from the Black sea. Three sisters have wandered the world bringing death and destruction. Researching in art history books I came to discover that Mater Suspiriorum established in Freiburg... Mother of Darkness, Mater Tenebrarum, in Nueva York, Mater Lacrimarum will come to Rome. They call her the Mother of Tears and she's the most beautiful and the most cruel of the three. And she's the only invict. Mater Tenebrarum and Mater Suspiriorum are dead for years. The Mother of Sighs is the one that killed my parents. Yes, your mother fought bravely but she could not stop her. A young dancer, Suzy Banion, could kill her. The opening of the box found by Brusco returned the power to the Mother of Tears. Who told that to you? Your friend Michael spoke to me by phone about a tunic which is a magical and powerful talisman. I have had visions. Witches from all around the world have come to celebrate her return. They arrive by air, by train, by car... They want Rome to fall again. They want to inaugurate the second era of witches. Sorry, Father, I am confused It is not your mind, it's the world that is sick. Come and see. Only I have a case of exorcism per month. In recent days I have faced more than throughout my life. Why all this? The Mother of Tears spreads evil all around her. A few killed, others are suffering, she causes chaos and human despair. I have a book in my studio to borrow you. Mother, you have arrived! Sarah, here. Run! Run toward my car! Open, quick! Why they are all going for me? For your mother. Hey, what are you doing? I call Michael. Don't be stupid. They can trace you. You'll sleep with me me tonight. At least you will be safe. No, I prefer to walk home. Michael may go for me later. This is my number and my address. It does not bother me, call me anytime. Thanks. You are the daughter of Elisa. You are like family for me. I do not want to scare you, but being who you are, you should not trust anyone. I promise. Wait, what's happening? They're burning the Church. The situation worsens. There was someone in my apartment, the light was turned on. I saw it beneath the door. I beg you, help me, Martha! Breathe deep. Calm down. Helga, she is Sarah. Hi. - What is she doing here? - Cool it, she's my friend. Please help me, I do not know what is happening to me. Why all this to me? Why? Because being who you are, they don't want to take risks. But... I am nobody. I know. No, you are more than you think. Helga, excuse us for a moment, please. You are gifted, Sarah. You must accept this fact, If you want to survive. Observe. The spirits roaming... they are many, especially here in Rome. The old house is full of ghosts. Think well, the city is 2700 years old. Underneath, there are five layers of cemeteries. How did you do that? You also can do it. With your skills, you see things that others do not see. Collect all your energy and concentrate at this point. Well, now lift the lid and blow. - Sarah. - It can not be. - Sarah. - Mamma! Do not touch her! Or she'll disappear. Mater Lacrimarum becomes stronger. Where are you? You are in grave danger, my daughter. Get ready for combat. Don't leave, mom. Marta, make her come back, please. She said that I should fight. Please help me. I am only a medium. I just can communicate with the spirits. I do not have your talent or your mother's. Now you need to be guided in the right direction. Tomorrow, I will introduce you to Guglielmo DeWitt. He is a great Belgian thinker. - Okay. - He will tell you anything useful. Thanks. Grab the phone! Hello! Marta! You must leave the house now! - Marta! Who is it? - Escape! It is already late for her. Run! Now! Mater! Where is Sarah? He was not at home. Idiot. Be strong, be strong! - - Mom. - Be strong, Sarah. Mom, what happened to Dad when...? It is a thing of the past... I am desperately angry with you. You have to be at my side, please do not leave me again. My little Sarah, I can not speak now. Use your skills, use it well! We have to look for a girl called Sarah Mandy. If you found her, comunicate immediately. Michael, come here What dou you have? Michael, you aren't well. Where is Paul? He's dead. - Oh, my God. - They killed him. But you don't want to talk about that. - Come on. - My home is not safe. We will go to my house and you'll explain everything - Don't turn the light on. - Why? They don't have to know that we are here. I'm happy to found you. - This cough... give the jacket. - No, no. I am cold. This house is frozen. Never went. I was followed. Now I know well. Sorry I didn't believe you. I'm so sorry. It's all right. You shouldn't smoke. The cough... Do you want me to prepare you anything? A tea? No, I'm okey. I'm so happy I found you. Now I am calm. Really. Michael, you are bleeding. - You're a liar. - How? It is true. No, I don't believe you. - You're a liar. - But, what do you say? - Let me see. - Don't touch, you are a liar! I told you to put your hands apart! Did you think you'd lose respect for me? My son... how naive you are. What have you done to your son? Your mother will not help you anymore Now we all have a single mother, the Mother of Tears. Witch, bitch! Find Guglielmo! We begin the news with what is undoubtedly news of the moment... they call it the second fall of Rome... the city is witnessing hundreds of violent acts... Commissioner Marchi, who do you think that is behind all this? It all started with the events at the Museum of Ancient Art in Rome. Yes, the brutal murder of the vicecurator Giselle Mares. But what is the nexus? All that is what uleashed all this hell. All pay attention to this woman... Sarah Mandy... The only witness to the tragedy of the Museum. If someone sees her, don't try to stop her. Call the Police. Shit! Hi. I must talk with Guglielmo DeWitt. Sorry, who are you? You don't know my name. OK, come on in. Did you want to see me? Please, sit down. As you can see, I can't move very much. My friend talked to me about... Did you think that I din't reconize you, Sarah Mandy? And that the Police is looking for you as a suspect of murder? One thing for us, the alchemists, is that we just don't look at only one side. Of course, the white magic is a good thing. The black magic too. The things that we do are based on our Artifacts. It's science. Esotericism, theosophy, laws of nature... a bit of this, a bit of that. This will exactly tell me who you are. And what thing you have really been able to see. I see that you have this instinct similar to the alchemists. Ah, you were sent by Marta Colussi. You have found your, Elisa Mandy. What have you done to me? What was your thought? That I would let you enter my house without knowing who actually you are? Well, exactly, why have you come here? I must find the Mother of Tears. Why? Haven't you seen what happens? Rome is plunged into chaos. We must stop her. What do you think to do? Kill her? Well, my mother was a powerful woman. And I think I have some of her powers. And when did you find that? I don't know. If you think in something, you must give a hand. Father Johannes said that she wants to start the second era of the witches. He was right. It already started in the city. It will be necessary more than a single good witch to face her. You should seek help. What do you mean? That I'm alone? I can't give you answers, but I can give you the information. We have to look to the roman alchemist named Varelli, he lived long ago in this town, he was a talented architect, at the end of his life, he built residences for the Three Mothers. Here are the things you need to know The Three Mothers. I do not know how much it'll cost, but I'll get what alchemists call SILENTIUM. We won't bribe profane minds with our knowledge. I have met the Three Mothers, I constructed for them three houses: One in Freiburg, one in New York and One in Rome. Otherwise, I found a horrible secret... from there is where the Sisters will spread pain, tears and darkness in the world. This design of the house is the one that Varelli built in Rome. What you see, it doesn't exit. what you don't see, it's the truth. It's an enigma Find the house of Mater Lacrimarum and you'll have the answer. Are you sure to go on? You don't know how much. Stop here! Hey, who are you? I have seen a group of women coming in here, did you see them? No, do you have something for me? Yeah, take. How long do you live here? So long... 30 or 40 years. I'm here since I escaped from the nazis when the war ended. Can you tell me who lived here before? I do not know... some sort of association of philosophers... artists. I do not remember. Why did the leave? When the nazis came, they took a lot of people. Hey, don't go in, I will denounce you! Listen. - She shouldn't go in. - She went it so fast. I will look upstairs. You watch here. All right. She's not here. You're an idiot, don't you remember what I told you to do? Inform! From anybody coming in here to browse around. - Is that clear? - Yeah. Come. Where did the go? I can feel them. What you see, it doesn't exit. what you don't see, it's the truth. The mystery of the house. These are the same signs that in the urn. We are in a secret catacomb. Oh my God. This is the house of the Mother of Tears. And her followers. - Witches. - Witches? The Three Graces. What are you doing here? I'm an art researcher. I came to visit the catacombs. Mater, give me the power! The tunic! Wonderful! Powerful! Mater, watch out! An intruder! Get him! We will eat you alive now. Get him! Our time is coming. Welcome, Sarah. Come closer. Come to me. Who wants to eat the girl? We have been waiting for this moment for a thousand years. Our power is here. Nobody will be able to stop us. Nobody no more! Nooooo, bitch! Sarah, it's me, calm down! Give me your hand, come on! Stay calm! Get out, get out. Panetone for Cinemageddon
