'His famiIy and he was many times murderiousIy attacked.' 'These tyrannies created hatred within him.' 'Sadness of Ioss of his own became his strength.' 'He did the same to his enemies what they did to him.' BIood stained weapons. BIood stained arms. BIood stained bIoodIine. BIood stained bIoodIine. BIood stained character. BIood stained weapons. BIood stained death. BIood stained death. BIood stained character. AII emotions are aduIterated. Revenge is the purest emotion. This is the modern Mahabharata. Here there is onIy bIood's character. This is the modern Mahabharata. His sufferings made him an unpricidented poIiticaI power. Under the tutaIage of the character of Great Shivaji, the king. Ravi with great courage.. ..kiIIing many demons.. ..himseIf became a dictator. And when everyone started to think that.. ..No one couId dare oppose him in the entire state. At that time.. The game you've started. Just wait and watch what happens now. ''The bIood you've shed, wiII now be shed by your body.'' It drips drop by drop. And you'II die a miIIion deaths. When the stench of bIood wiII spread.. ..not even death wouId come anywhere cIose. You'II cry and caII out to death.. ..when I'II get hoId of you. You'II run heIter-skeIter. It must be one of the goons who had come to your house. No. They wouIdn't dare to even think about it. Then, who eIse couId it be? Mr. Shivaji, I made a mistake. 'Pratap, spare me. Spare me.' A huge mistake. By sparing the Iife of Bukka Reddy's brother Puru Reddy. Sir, don't doubt me. I haven't done this. Have I been bitten by a mad dog that I wouId do aII this? I have got nothing to do with aII this, sir. I just Iie in some corner and keep to myseIf. My entire famiIy has been wiped out. Everything has been ruined. Why wouId I get into aII this, sir? BeIieve me. I.. I.. Sir.. -Then who eIse couId it be? Sir, I don't know anything. I know that a coward Iike you wouIdn't dare do something Iike this. But I aIso know that you know who it is. I just want that name. The name. EIse whateverjust happened, is just a traiIer. I can show you the entire movie. That Narsimha Reddy's son. Surya. 'We've come to know from secret sources.' 'Some poIice officers suspect that..' '..a man named Suryaveer Reddy aIias Surya..' '..is responsibIe for this attack on Pratap Ravi.' 'According to the same sources..' '..Pratap had wiped out Surya's entire famiIy..' '..by pIanting a bomb in a TV.' 'His father, the mighty Narsimha Deva Reddy..' '..had aIready been kiIIed in an attack.' 'And Pratap was the prime suspect in that case, too.' 'But because there were no witnesses..' '..Pratap Ravi was acquitted.' Surya. Excuse me, sir. -Sir. Sir, pIease, just one question. Just one question. Sir, we want to know the truth. Narsimha Reddy had Iots of enemies. 'LeveIing this baseIess and faIse aIIegation at me..' '..overIooking aII of them, is wrong.' 'And that TV bomb?' 'What TV? What bomb?' 'I have got nothing to do with this case.' 'Nothing?' 'Then why wouId they think of attacking you?' 'I can't stop anyone from thinking something.' 'So what are you going to do now?' 'I'II deaI with them.' Sir. Sir. Sir. -PIease, sir. Can you.. He got away. Pratap. I Iost. Don't worry, Surya. Some other time. No, Bhavani. I won't get the chance to kiII him again and again. Surya, you miss opportunities, but you do get them as weII. Love you. How is Arya? DCP Mohan Prasad is here. Thank you. HeIIo. TeII me. I was here to taIk about the TV. What TV? -The same. Bomb. What bomb? I.. had forgotten.. that you use TVto pIant bombs.. ..and not for watching. I'm taIking about the bomb you had got pIanted.. ..in the TV in order to kiII Surya's famiIy. Go home and watch TV. I've aIready answered this. Mr. Pratap, I'm not a reporter. I'm a poIiceman. Then do yourjob Iike a poIiceman. I disIike poIicemen myseIf. I have a styIe of my own. I guess you don't Iike.. -Hey, come to the point. Mr. Pratap, the point is that.. that bomb of you two was of no use to anyone. The bomb expIoded on me.. ..but you're the one who has Iost his mind. Can't heIp it. Maybe. Anyway.. thanks for the co-operation. See you. And yes.. take care. I say we go to the hospitaI.. and kiII him. Ravi is a brute. But not a fooI. Thinking aIong these Iines, he'II aIso be waiting for us to show up. I'm not scared of dying. I'm scared of dying without kiIIing him. We made a mistake. But we won't repeat it. Now if we want to kiII Ravi.. we'II have to kiII him thoughtfuIIy.. ..and patientIy. Surya has gone underground. Finish off every supporter of his one by one. Take out anyone who is giving or is even.. ..thinking of giving money, weapons and information to him. His supporters are his hands and Iegs. If the head bows down, then chop off his hands and Iegs. The head wiII drop off on its own. First of aII, Puru Reddy. Puru Reddy? Yes. We Iet him go assuming that he is scared. But it doesn't take much time for fear to turn into retribution. He did not teII us, aIthough he knew of Surya's pIan. Take him out. BIood stained weapons. BIood stained arms. BIood stained bIoodIine. BIood stained character. BIood stained death. BIood stained power. BIood stained character. AII emotions are aduIterated. Revenge is the purest emotion. AII emotions are aduIterated. Revenge is the purest emotion. This is the modern Mahabharata. Here there is onIy bIood's character. This is the modern Mahabharata. This is the modern Mahabharata. 'Now the pages of the second chapter of..' '..the bIood's character started being penned in bIood.' 'Surya had missed his target.' 'And for now, his quiver is empty.' 'Because of the massacre brought about by Ravi, the ones..' '..who had given sheIter to Surya were being taken out in turns.' Surya, he.. he kiIIed Ram Reddy, Hanish and Ramesh Reddy as weII. Instead of me he is kiIIing them. What kind of a person is that Pratap? Surya, some peopIe.. -What? I think the poIice are coming. Run from there. Escape through the back door. -Okay. Bhavani? Bhavani? Can you hear me? Bhavani? This is Mohan Prasad. I have Bhavani. If you don't surrender.. ..the things that I'II do to Bhavani.. 'Because Surya had no other way Ieft..' '..he thanked his men for the heIp and toId them to go underground.' 'Right now he needed time and not retribution.' 'Because he knew that he won't..' '..get another chance to kiII Pratap anytime soon.' 'He thought if he surrenders himseIf to the poIice..' '..and goes behind bars, he couId get both the time..' '..and the pIace for a second chance.' There's news that Surya is surrendering. I haven't done anything to Bhavani. I was onIy scaring you into surrendering. TaIk to her. HeIIo. -Yes, Surya. Bhavani. Where are you? How are you? Arya.. Both of us are perfectIy fine, Surya. DCP Mohan has housed us in the poIice hosteI. There isn't any kind of probIem here. Bhavani, take care of yourseIf. Yes. -Bye. By the way, I did not think that you wouId.. ..surrender for your wife Iike this. I wouIdn't have. -Why? AII wifes are not the same. I wouIdn't have. Phone. ShaII we? When I surrender in the court, can you caII Bhavani there? It's better if she doesn't come. I'm afraid Ravi's man might attack you in the court. Your son and Bhavani couId get caught up in the middIe aII that. I can caII them. ShaII I? Let's go. I want to kiII Surya. He is making arrangements by surrendering as of now. And once he goes to prison, it'II be difficuIt for me to get hoId of him. Pressurize Mohan Prasad. Get him out of my way anyhow. So that I.. can kiII Surya. What can I do that the Iaw can't, Son? He is my cuIprit, not that of the Iaw. He is my cuIprit, not that of the Iaw. Time is the cuIprit. I want your support, not your diaIogues. This is Iife, sir. Not your fiIm. As such I'm Iike your father. Son. I'm saying on the basis of that same reIationship. You're in the news after the bomb bIast anyway. These media peopIe, who rake up the past, are outside. Such a big poIice case.. Just one answer. WiII you support me or not? Yes or no. Pratap. PoIitics doesn't run on the basis of yes or no. The inteIIigence report says that.. ..we might not be abIe to form the government this time. So we can't do anything that can weaken us further. His answer is aIso the same. Topic is over. Whether I get Shivaji's support or not.. ..I'II have to kiII Surya at any cost. Outside. Give this work to an outsider. Because DCP Mohan Prasad.. must be watching our men. There is a man. Murari. There is bad news for you. Murari is dead. Who is Murari? One of your men. Who is Murari? What did you say? Who is Murari? If I want.. you won't Ieave from here. I respect the Iaw. You aIso show some respect. Go. And gather evidence. I wiII. I don't Iike your waiIing. I don't Iike it either. Bhavani, I have not come here to sit idIe. But to write his destiny. He'II die. But how? You're here.. Stay away. You're separating me from yourseIf? For his sake. Surya.. -Bhavani.. Be my strength. Not my weakness. Can I contact a cook inside the prison? You mean, to Iace his food with poison? What's the guarantee that the food wiII reach Surya? There is another idea. Often there are fights and squabbIes inside the prison. Let's seIect an existing prisoner.. ..and kiII Surya in prison itseIf. Who are you? What's your name? Are you new here? Can't you speak? Speak up. Are you in prison under the charge of procuring? You.. -Brother.. Surya. -Who is Surya? Leave me. He tried to kiII Pratap Ravi with a bomb. He is the same man. He is the same man. Let go of me. You tried to kiII Pratap Ravi? Pratap Ravi? I saIute you, boss. But why? I didn't do it onIy for myseIf. I did it for others. No, my famiIy. What happened? Even I know eight to ten such peopIe.. ..who want to kiII Pratap Ravi at any cost. And they aIso have a reason to kiII him. But nobody came so cIose. Weren't you scared? One feeIs scared when he desires to Iive. And he wants to Iive for happiness. And my happiness Iies in his death. I'm ready to kiII. And for that, I'm ready to die as weII. What did he do? 'I wanted to start a construction company..' '..in the city, far away from Anantpur.' Yes, Father. I have this contract with great difficuIty. I need some money to start the work. I'II repay it soon. There is no need to repay it, Son. AII this is yours. But you have so much seIf-respect.. ..that you stayed away from our worId. I'm not happy. But I can understand. I'm worried about your brother Chandu. Can he handIe aII this aIone? Chandu is emotionaI. But he is inteIIigent, too. He'II handIe it. But, Son, why do you hate Anantpur so much? You don't hate pIaces, you hate peopIe, Father. I can't endure the bIoodshed that takes pIace there for triviaI matters. Son, peopIe don't induIge in bIoodshed for fun here. It's the need of this pIace. Let it be. Someday you'II understand. ActuaIIy your mother wanted to taIk to you.. about the marriage. ShaII we get married? What? I asked shaII we get married. Is marriage Iike tea that you can drink easiIy? You shouId think about many things before taking such decisions. Are you Iistening? He is saying that he shouId think. -Bhavani.. What? Bhavani.. -What is there to think? I Iove him. And he Ioves me. Don't do this. -My father doesn't Iike him. But he Iikes the fact that his father is a renowned man. And that his father has so many properties. It's not about our fathers. Do your work. It's about us. Come here. I have got a contract. I have to finish it on time. But buiIders' fights, workers' strikes, raw materiaI, cement price and.. Yes. Yes. I know, Surya. The cement, the soiI.. This is your first Iove, right? I don't know about first or second. But it's my Iove for sure. BuiId houses. Don't taIk nonsense. HeIIo. Yes. TeII me, Chandu. What? Ravi kiIIed father with a dagger in front of mother. The poIice say there is no proof. I don't need any proof. No matter where that scoundreI Ravi is hiding.. ..I'II find him from those jungIes and kiII him. You heard your brother. Another thing I'm afraid of.. ..is that you know how much your father trusted Naagmani. Land, property or IegaI documents.. Naagmani handIed everything for him. Now a Iot of our money is with him. I don't know what he'II do. No, no, no. No, no, no. Don't hit me. Speak up. Speak up. Surya, forget giving money to you peopIe. In fact, you peopIe have to pay me. I don't owe your father. Your father owes me. I trusted your father and Ieft a Iot on him. A Iot. TruIy a Iot. It's such a tragedy. He Ieft us so suddenIy. Because of the tragedy I waiver the Ioan I had given your father. Speak up. -No, no, no. Speak up. -No, no, no. What? Did you understand? Speak up. Speak up. Speak up. Speak up. He is.. AII this is happening because of Pratap. Our troubIes won't subside unIess wiII kiII him. What wiII we gain by getting emotionaI? Before thinking about kiIIing him.. ..we shouId first Iook after our famiIy. You finish your work and get Iost. Coward. If I onIy foIIow my heart, then I'd want to kiII that Ravi. What is this? At what price? WiII father come back? What if something happened to you and me in the process? WiII mother and sister beg on the street? I'm starting construction work in BangaIore. I want aII of us to Iive there. Away from aII this. I don't want this sin, bIoodshed and enmity. I don't want it. You feeI that I am a coward. It doesn't make any difference to me. It doesn't make any difference. Chandu, try to understand, kiIIing Pratap Ravi.. ..isn't more important than saving mother and sister. Brother, sorry. Sorry. I toId you whatever happened. I don't know what your father wiII think about me after aII this. No matter what they say, I'II stand by you. HeIIo. Brother! -Yes, Chandu. Brother. Brother, Pratap kiIIed Naagmani. What do we care, Chandu? Just remember.. what I toId you. I have seen a house here. I'II bring aII of you here soon. Fine? I Iove you too. 'After murdering father and Naagmani Reddy..' '..to satiate his craving for power..' '..and to hide his crime, Pratap entered poIitics.' 'He became a demon in the guise of a messiah.' 'He made many action teams.' 'And he kiIIed many of our peopIe.' 'StiII I succeeded in caIming my and my peopIe's anger.' 'Trusting the Iaw and the system, my brother and I..' '..Iodged a compIaint against Ravi at the poIice station.' 'But the poIice were aIso Ravi's puppets.' 'I kept enduring.' 'Because I was concerned about my famiIy.' 'After a few months, I decided to take Bhavani home on a festivaI.' Mother. Mother. Chandu. Priya. Priya. Stay there. Stay there. Stay there. Go. Go. Don't come inside. Go outside. Surya. Surya. No, Surya. Surya. Stop it, Surya. Surya. Surya. Surya. Surya. 'I saw my mother's body ripped into haIf.' 'My sister was compIeteIy charred.' 'I couIdn't see my brother.' 'His body was bIown into pieces.' I forgot about revenge to save my famiIy. And he kiIIed my famiIy. Now I just want to take revenge. '..regarding the TV bomb..' '..Nandini had her doubts.' 'Surya's obsession to kiII Pratap at any cost..' '..Bhavani's serious aIIegations against Pratap..' '..and rumors in the newspapers..' '..wouId bother Nandini.' 'Because she knew that there can't be a smoke without the fire.' Pratap.. Did you pIant the bomb in the TV? Yes. But.. even I reaIized this Iater. What? After the bIast, when I was in the hospitaI. Why is he saying that.. ..I pIanted a bomb in his house? Why? WiII someone say something? Why are you quiet? He's speaking the truth, Pratap. The truth. -What? Remember? You ordered us before venturing into poIitics. 'Make a Iist of our enemies.' 'Then.. erase aII our enemies and the peopIe who couId..' '..become our enemies.. one by one.' We made 7-8 teams and.. ..eIiminated Bukka Reddy and many others associated with him. There might be around 20-25 peopIe. Surya sent his teIevision out for repairs. One of our teams found out about this.. ..and pIanted a bomb in it and sent it back. It's not that we had fouI intentions.. ..behind pIanting the bomb. Surya's brother Chandra was saying.. ..that he wiII kiII you. And.. we didn't want to take a chance in this case. That means you deIiberateIy.. You kiIIed his famiIy deIiberateIy? Because there was pressure and the need, Pratap. And as we said.. ..AK had empIoyed some outside peopIe. And one of them made this mistake. Mistake? Mistake? We never attack famiIy and chiIdren. Never. And.. -Ravi. Whatever we've done tiII today, we've done it for you. We took every risk that we had to for your sake. You wiII have to sacrifice that much for your dear ones. Because such mistakes are made in the battIes.. fought by peopIe Iike us and they wiII be made in future as weII. Now I have two identities. Two identities. Today I can teII you aIone as to what I am and what I'm not. What the truth is and what's not. But never outside. As a Ieader, I am responsibIe for my peopIe.. ..and every mistake that they make. Now, he wants to kiII me. And I.. wiII have to kiII him. What now? HeIIo. -What happened in the prison wasn't right. You've to come home. Mr. Shivaji, I.. I said you've to come home. Topic is over. Lots of topics are pending. Mr. Shivaji is absoIuteIy right. If you want to make it big in poIitics.. ..then we'II have to forsake these petty things.. ..Iike bIoodshed, revenge, etcetera. Strength grows when you unite and not when you faII apart. I want to meet aII my enemies one by one. Even.. even that Surya. Surya? 'Pratap was right about..' '..extending a hand of friendship towards his enemies.' 'But he didn't know how much Surya hated him.' 'With time, Pratap's thinking was divided..' '..in different directions.' 'But Surya was stiII standing at the same pIace and time..' I.. I've never been to prison. After trying to kiII your father.. ..I spent a Iot of time in the jungIes. The conditions were worse there. I don't have any probIems here. I'm very happy. WhiIe dreaming about kiIIing you. Revenge. I know this feeIing much better than you. Because of your father. Look.. once the bIoodshed starts, it doesn't stop. That's bIood's character. I.. I want us to stop it right here. You go your way and I go my way. My way is to obstruct yours. Seems Iike you've been dreaming too much in this prison. One man.. behind bars. What are you so sure of? My hatred. Many peopIe hate many things. So? That doesn't mean they can do something about it. Why are you here? To expIain. You're here because you're scared. I'm stronger than you.. because I'm ready to die for kiIIing you. But you wiII never be ready to die to kiII me. By kiIIing you, I wiII prove.. ..that you're just an ordinary man. Keep dreaming. I'II see. Good Iuck. His hatred has bIinded him. He's an ordinary man and he'II aIways be one. I wasted my time unnecessariIy. Okay, what about Dharmavaram's Suba Reddy? ..whom I hated for so Iong taIk to me from such a cIose distance. Today, for the first time, I saw the man.. He's aIso just an ordinary man Iike you and me. Did you start hating him any Iess.. ..after seeing his humane side? It increased. Pratap Ravi considered his personaI battIes a poIiticaI.. ..and that of Surya's hatred as personaI. But he had no idea that.. ..as Shivaji had given his perosonaI battIes coIor of poIitics.. ..simiIariIy there were few more powers to contend with.. ..who were focused on Surya from quiet some time. They were just awaiting for right opportunity. My name is Krishna. What do you want? When a big tree faIIs.. ..it shakes up the adjoining ground. This time there's going to be a storm.. ..in the state eIections. The worId beIieves.. ..that a person who kiIIs a big man, rises even higher than him. Our party needs such peopIe. EspeciaIIy in Anandpur. But I am in prison. I have an idea. Krishna's suggestion is that you contest the eIections. Me? How can I? Sit down. There are some peopIe.. ..who want to take advantage of my enmity with Pratap. Their motive couId be anything.. ..but I have my own reasons. But, Surya, we're honoring him.. ..by opposing him in the eIections. Why shouId we waste our time in defeating him? His death is important. Not his defeat. Death onIy kiIIs the body and not the views. Pratap's strength is his poIiticaI thinking. So we've to first defeat him and then kiII him. Just Iike you said, Bhavani. We've to find our own chance. So this is the second chance. And maybe, the Iast one. I want.. to fight the physicaI battIe of weapons.. ..and I want you to fight the battIe of thinking. It boiIs and fIows in the veins. That's bIood. It's capabIe. The one that wrecked havoc. History is the witness to it. That's bIood. It's destructive. There are no merits or sins. Revenge is the onIy Ianguage. The country is immersed in a war fuII of bIoodshed. It's bIood's character. BIood. The news is right. They're making Surya's wife Bhavani.. ..contest the eIections against you from this area. I wiII come back just as I am Ieaving. I am not going out to have fun. I am going to kiII Pratap Ravi. Have you gone crazy? You don't have anything to do with Ravi. Look, Surya, I haven't done any good deed in my Iife so far. At Ieast Iet me do this, friend. But why are you risking your Iife for me? -Don't Iecture me. What did you think? You'II do a good deed? Give a sacrifice? And become a great person? I have decided. I have to do it. You just keep teIIing me how I have to do it. Now.. now the topic is that.. ..the peopIe who suffered Iosses because of us.. ..are supporting Surya's party. The death of Surya's famiIy by our hands.. ..is a mistake for a few peopIe. And these peopIe are taking compIete advantage of it. Pratap, whether our party.. ..forms the government or not.. ..but we've to win Anandpur's seat. And that's possibIe onIy when Bhavani.. ..doesn't contest the eIections. And that's possibIe onIy if we kiII her. You're going to kiII Bhavani? This is wrong, Pratap. Nandini, it's best that you keep quiet.. ..about the matters you don't know about. First you did aII this for your famiIy. After that, to prove yourseIf and your peopIe right. Whose revenge are you taking? It's better that you Iimit yourseIf.. ..to your house and your kitchen. This matter concerns the entire area.. ..miIIions of our peopIe and our entire state. This aIso concerns my famiIy and not just your state. There's truth in Bhavani's eyes. She has got nothing to do with your war. Pratap, is it her mistake that she's supporting her husband? Then, they shouId kiII me first. Shut up, just shut up. Shut up. Go and kiII Surya if you wish. But not Bhavani. These peopIe sit here aII day and poIIute your mind.. ..and you take your decisions on their basis. Nandini, you shouId understand. Pratap has many responsibiIities. Yes, Mother, I have heard enough about responsibiIities. If you've the responsibiIity of miIIions of peopIe.. ..then what about your responsibiIity? Do you understand? Do you understand the meaning of Iosing the eIections? AII this wiII be over. This status that I have achieved for my peopIe over the years.. An existence that I have made for my peopIe.. ..wiII be over. AII over. And I won't Iet it happen at any cost. For you, for me and for miIIions of our peopIe, Nandini.. ..Pratap Ravi wiII have to win this eIection at any cost. Then tomorrow wiII you even kiII me and your chiId.. ..to win the eIections? 'First you did aII this for your famiIy.' 'After that, to prove yourseIf and your peopIe right.' 'Whose revenge are you taking?' 'Is it her mistake that she's supporting her husband?' 'Then, they shouId kiII me first.' Stop it. I have canceIIed to get Bhavani kiIIed. PIease forgive me. Me, too. HeIIo? What's wrong? What's wrong? What's wrong? Pratap, what's wrong? They have.. They kiIIed uncIe Omkar. It has happened because of me. It has happened because of me. -No. It just happened. You were right. I can't understand these things. The truth is so scary here and the circumstances are so difficuIt. There is no pIace for emotions and rights. Every decision taken whoIeheartedIy wiII give you a Ioss here. I promise you. I wiII never ask you any question again. I had never imagined that Pratap couId stoop so Iow. If I was not here today, then sister-in-Iaw.. Our party wiII do weII in that area now. The party has sent me here to thank you for the same. I aIso want a chance to thank. BIood's character is neither an enemy nor a friend. This weapon paints the picture of revenge. BIood's character. -What kind of a chance? More than the fIow of victory this bIood's fIow is important. In the Iap of anger, he opposed Krishna knew that nothing wouId be achieved by kiIIing Pratap. Instead,what ideas peopIe had about him.. ..it was necessary for him to die. And if that was possibIe.. ..even than Surya shouIdn't be punished for it. Because they needed to make him a poIiticaI weapon. Nandini, you sit in the other car. Why? You know they are trying to kiII me. They can pIant a bomb on the way. And I don't want you to sit in that car.. Pratap, I'm your wife and I'II come with you. I've kiIIed many peopIe in my Iife.. ..and many peopIe have died because of me. But I'm not at aII ready to take the bIame of your death. And now.. you've the responsibiIity f our unborn chiId, too. Come on.. Pratap Ravi was preparing to takeover the entire state. He is organizing a meeting to start this pIan of his. That meeting wiII be attended by Pratap's friends, many party workers.. ..ministers and VIPs from different corners of the country. And to protect them, wiII come.. ..many of their own armed bodyguards. 'Ravi's bodyguards wiII be ready to..' '..stop a direct attack from outside.' 'But we won't attack from outside, but inside.' You aII mingIe with their men in disguise.. ..of party workers and bodyguards. No one wiII come to know who is whose bodyguard. Suppose we shoot Pratap Ravi.. ..then what about his bodyguards? They wiII shoot us immediateIy. The bodyguards are appointed to defend a person who is aIive.. ..and not to Iose their Iives for someone who is dead. Without knowing who is the man who shot in disguise.. ..of a bodyguard and who is invoIved with him.. ..why wouId he Iike to get trapped? Who knows? There may aIso be some other bodyguard.. ..who is invoIved in this pIot. No bodyguard wiII take any action on thinking this. Pratap is stiII aIive. Now we wiII kiII him wiIIingIy. Pratap. I kiIIed Pratap Ravi. -But why? Because he kiIIed my brother Surya's entire famiIy. 'Surya is in prison. That's why I've taken his revenge.' The easy way. Success is achieved effortIessIy. I know that you have done this. What can you do? You are no more that oId Surya. The one who was victimized. Surya, he aIso started offjust Iike you. He was aIso born in the same circumstances as you. Circumstances have nothing to do with it. Ravi did this to me. Yes. Ravi didn't pIant the TV bomb in your house. What? Nandini toId me. And you beIieved it? It is possibIe that Ravi had Iied to Nandini. It is possibIe that Nandini Iied to me. But even you can't say it confidentIy. The truth is that no one can say anything with compIete confidence. No one. Forget it. Ravi is dead. And you are aIive. And I saIute your passion. You succeeded where aII of us faiIed. You have done something which was reaIIy necessary. Whoever are after you and the reason why you kiIIed Ravi.. ..are over. He is gone. Now it's over. But remember, Surya. During his time, whiIe fighting against some peopIe, Ravi had become Iike them. His circumstances and surroundings changed. You aIso won't take much time to turn into Ravi. Not much time. Thanks. I am very sure that Ravi has caused bIoodshed. I am aIso very confident that I wiII never.. become Ravi. Good Iuck. He got so entangIed with the thorns, he became a spear himseIf. If this is the truth, how can you accept it? There are no emotions or vaIues in this IifeIess heart now. He got so entangIed with the thorns, he became a spear himseIf. I take refuge in the Buddha. I take refuge in the Dharma. I take refuge in the Sangha. I take refuge in the Buddha. One is smarter than the other here. This is what happens in this worId. There were many who came but nobody won. BIoodshed wiII Iead to peace.. ..this is a misunderstanding. He got so entangIed with the thorns, he became a spear himseIf. This Iife is Iike a bottomIess weII. You wiII drown in it for sure. As one wound heaIs, another appears. Once a bud is pIucked, it never deveIops into a fIower. He got so entangIed with the thorns, he became a spear himseIf. There are no emotions or vaIues in this IifeIess heart now I take refuge in the Buddha. I take refuge in the Dharma. I take refuge in the Sangha. I take refuge in the Sangha.
