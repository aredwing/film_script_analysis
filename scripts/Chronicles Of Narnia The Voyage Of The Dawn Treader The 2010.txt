Better next time, kid. Chappie? He was only two years older. I am a king. I've fought wars and armies landed. Not in this world. - Yes, I'm down here now. Battles with the worthless Clarence Scrubb. Then, when someone worthy of the name. What are you doing? Nothing. Come on. Dear Diary. It is now 253 days... since my nasty cousins Edmund and Lucy invaded our house. I do not know how long I can still to live with them. And my stuff to share. If your relatives but could treat though the insects. Then all my problems are solved. Then I could get them into a pot. And they hang on my wall. - I'm home. Note to self. Research legal ramifications of relatives. Now that the war news from the western front. - Hi, Uncle Harold. I wanted to buy carrots, but they had only turnip greens. Should I start making soup? And Alberta is on the way home. Uncle Harold? - Father. Edward makes faces at you. You little... - Father, he's going to hit me. Edmund look, this is Susan. I wish you were here with us. It is such an adventure. But not like our time in Narnia. America is very exciting. Only we never father. He works so hard. I was invited by a naval officer at the tea party of the British consul. Who happens very pretty. I think he likes me. It seems that the Germans crossing made more difficult. These are hard times. Mother hopes that you do not mind... for a few months in Cambridge to stay. A few more months? How do we survive? You're lucky. You have your own room. I am stuck with snaterbek. Susan and Peter are the lucky ones. On adventure. - They are the elders. We are the youngest. We do not matter much. I look like Susan? Have you seen this ship? - Yes, it looks like in Narnia. Another reminder that we and not there. There were two orphans who wasted their time... who believed in Narnia's nursery rhymes. Please let me beat him. - No. Do not you ever knock? - It's my house. I do what I want. You are just guests. It is anyway not a fascinating painting. It's horrible. You do not see it on the other side the door. It seems that the water is really moving. Nonsense. That happens when you in those stories of you believe. There once was a boy, Eustace, those books reading for facts which were worthless. People who read fairy tales are always a repulsive load compared to people like me. I read books with real information. - A charge repulsive? I you have not seen protruding finger Since we are here. I would like to tell your father that you the candy you stole from Aunt Alberta. Liar? - Really? Edmund, the painting. - I found them under your bed. I've been licked each sweet. I'm infected with you. What is going on here? - Lucy, do you think... This is a trick. Stop or I'll tell to the mother. Mother. Save the ordinary item. Do something. - No. Help me. - Let me go. Let go. Eustace, swimming. - What's going on? Swimming! Swim. I got you. Caspian? - Lucy. Edmund, it is Caspian. - You're safe now. Are we in Narnia? - Yes, you are in Narnia. I would not go. Take me back to England. Hold on. That was exciting. How did you get here? - I have no idea. Great to see you. - Did you not call us? No, not this time. Anyway, I'm happy to be here. Get that thing off me. Reepicheep. Your Majesties. - Hello, Reep. What a pleasure. - The pleasure is on my side. What should we do with this hysterical intruder do? Giant rat that wanted my face open bite. I just wanted the water get out of your lungs. Has anyone heard him talk? - He always talks. His mouth shut, that's the trick. If nothing needs to be said, Highness, I promise you that I will not say. I do not know what this area is but now I want to wake up. Maybe we can throw him back? And being abducted by a kind of zeepiratencarnaval. Where the hell am I? You're on the Dawn Treader. The best ship of the navy of Narnia. Is it something I said? Care for him. - Your majesty. Men. Behold our castaways. Edmund the Just Lucy and the Brave. High King and Queen of Narnia. Aslan. Look, the bow of Cesar. My Healing Juice and dagger. Can I? - Of course. They are yours. Peter's sword. - Yes. I have to fit. As promised. Here. Keep it down if you want. No, it's yours. Peter has given it to you. This I saved it for you. Thanks. Since you're gone, the Giants North unconditionally surrendered. Then we have the army Calormen Reports in the Great Desert. There is peace throughout Narnia. - Peace? For three years. Did you in that three years already found a queen? No. No person your sister can be compared. If there are no more wars to fight and nobody's in trouble... why are we here? - It's a good question. That I have also wondered. Where we sail to? - He has the throne of my uncle back. He has my father's closest friends and supporters are trying to murder. The seven Lords of Telmar. They fled to the Lone Islands. No one has since been slightly heard of them. You think something happened to them? - If so... it is my duty to find out. What lies east of the Lone Islands? Unfamiliar waters. Things that you hardly can imagine. Stories of sea snakes and worse. Sea snakes. - Captain, enough of your great stories. I want to be where the waves are sweet. Descends upon you, Reepicheep. And each wave... flows over you. I describe the meaning and words. What is it you think behind the Lone Islands? I am told that if you go to the sail east, that's the end of the world. Aslan's country. - Do you really believe such a place exists? We have nothing if we do not believe. You really think you do can go sailing? Since you only one way to find out. I just hope one day I have the right I deserve to see that. Your majesty. You are stronger, my friend. It shows. Back to work again. Thanks. Do you think if we keep on sailing to the end of the world, we... edge of the waste? Do not worry. That is still far from that. I hear you still talk crap. Do you feel better? - Yes, but not because of you. I have an iron constitution. - Another scintillating as I see. Have you found your sea legs? - Never been lost. I have to just handle the shock. Mother says I'm easy to understand. Thanks to my intelligence. I think he is nowhere in smooth. I'll let you know as soon as We in the civilized world. I contact the British Consulate. You are arrested for kidnapping. Kidnapping? That's funny. I thought we had saved your life. You keep me here against my will down. - Did I do that? In the most squalid rooms. It looks like a zoo there. He complains quite happy, eh? - He is only warming up. Landfall. - East of the mound. The Lone Islands. Narrow Haven's portal. Strange. No Narnia flag in sight. The Lone Islands always been of Narnia. This seems suspicious. I say we should go ashore. Drinian? - Forgive me, Your Majesty... Prince Caspian, but the administration argues on this ship. We use rowboats. Find out what men Drinian and go to the shore. Let the rowboats down. Spread the sails... and get ready to anchor lowering. Forward. The voltage of the unknown lies before us. Did not wait until tomorrow? There is no honor when you think of the danger turns away, boy. Listen. Where is everybody? Come on, pudding leg. - I can myself. And he is your kinsman? Reepicheep, stay here with men's Drinian and make sure it is safe. We go further. If we do not back the dawn... send some men. - Yes, Your Majesty. Seems like nobody is there. Should not we go back? Come here and watch over something. Oh, yes. Good idea, cousin. Very logical. I got it. Do not worry. I'm ready when you are too. Who are these people? - Why are they crossed? It looks like prices. - Slave Dealers. Watch out. Unless you this again as a girl want to hear you scream... I would say, let your arms but fall. I'm not a girl. - Now. Put it down. Store them in irons. - Come here you. Let me go. Take these two to the market. Bring that to the two dungeons. Listen to me rude idiot. I am your king. There you will pay for it. - Actually... someone else will pay. For all of you. Is everything okay? - Yes. That is hopeless. You never get out. Who's there? - Nobody. Simply a voice in my head. Lord Bern? That was me once. I do not deserve that title anymore. Is he one of the seven? Your face. You remind me a king that I once loved. That man was my father. My Lord, please forgive me. No, please. No. Mama. Go back. - Mama. Stick with daddy. - Do not worry. I like you. Mama. They take them where you go? - Keep watching. What happened? - It's a sacrifice. Where did they go? - Nobody knows. The fog was first seen in the east. Reports of fishermen and sailors lost at sea. Lords We made a pact... the source of the fog to find and to destroy them. They sailed all out. But none of them came back. If they break the slavers sell... then you miss the place. - We need to find Lucy. Before it's too late. - I offer 60. I offer 80. - 100 for the little lady. - 150. Who else offers? SOLD Come on, run. And now, for this nice copy. Who starts bidding? He may not seem like much, but he is strong. Yes, he's strong. Smells the back of a Minotaur. That is an outrageous lie. I won the race in the school Otillious rally. Would anyone offer? - I take him off your hands. I take them all out of your hands. For Narnia! Thanks, Bar. I knew you would come. - Your Highness. Grab the keys. Keys. You're a boat in a magical land. You do not grow? I hope that the British consul was. Your majesty. - Wait. My wife brought this morning. - Dad. I beg you Please take me with you. I want to go. - No, Gael. Stick to your aunt. I am a good sailor. I am all my life at sea. Of course, you should. - Thank you. If I do not ever come back... behave. My king. This is to me by your father. I have safely hidden in a cave. All those years. - This is Narnia an old sword. That's out of your Golden Age. There are seven of those swords. Gifts Aslan to Narnia protection. Your father trusted them to us. Here. Take it. And it may protect you. Thank you, my Lord. We will find your missing people. Dear diary. Things are great changes. I am carried away by my nephew and niece and I drift into uncharted waters. In an idiot looking boot. What is worse, I need the space Share with a mouse or other. And I still thought that a room Share my cousin was bad enough. Thus far, everyone I meet dies have in this strange place... from terrible delusions. Green fog on hunting and searching for missing Lords. I think this is only the result of bad food. They are all completely insane. Cousin Edmund is no exception. Every minute of time is spent tin with that sword of him to brush... as if a magic lantern. Poor idiot clearly need a hobby. It is beautiful. They are also smaller? Pesky groundhog. He's crazier than my cousin. In England we have mousetraps and things like that. You know where I can find some? Why did you do to that bird? I assumed... - He talks to birds. He is as mad as a hatter. Go away. Do you steal rations at sea is a capital crime? Above. You. - Men are less keelhauled. What? - Treason and procrastination... and mutiny. Enter the orange, then we do not talk about. I do not know what you're talking about. - Allow me... I'm tired of you. - Leave the tails. The great Aslan himself me the tail data. Nobody, I repeat, nobody touches the tail. Point. Exclamation mark. - Sorry. Now I get the orange and then I get satisfaction. I am a passionate fist. Watch out. - Sorry. Are you trying to run away? We're on a boat. We can not discuss? That is to steal, which lie and that's the bargain. As it should. A duel. Catch. Come on. Give your best stroke. Is that it? Come on, boy. Not so with flapping your wings like a drunk pelican. Lift up. Keep your edge up. Here. Not with your foot. Not left, just right. Got it? Come on. The Nimble. This is a dance, boy. Come on. And again. And right. Oh, no. That's that. Look. Gael, what are you doing here? It seems that we have an extra crew member. Welcome aboard. - Your majesty. Call me Lucy. Come on. Come on, at work again. Good fight. I still make a swordsman of you. If the deck which was right... it would be a whole different outcome. Indeed. It looks uninhabited off. If the Lords the fog to the east have followed, they would have stopped here. It is a trap. Or it may contain some answers. - Caspian? We spend the night on land. Tomorrow morning we explore the island. Yes, Your Majesty. They have apparently taken a pig. This. It's a woman. This also. Read it. Let's take her. You can not escape. - We are scary. What are you? - We are scary invisible animals. If you could see us, would you really impressed. You forgot to tell that we all very large. What do you want? - You'll do what we ask. That'll do. - Very clear. What else? - Death. Death. I am of no use when I'm dead. I had not thought of yet. - No, you did not. Well, then we murder just your friends. Good idea. - What do you want with me? You'll be home of Tiran enter. What house? - That. Above you will find the magic book... read the speech which the invisible visible. Well said. Go on. We have not got all day. Remember what happened to your friends will. You've been warned. - Yes. Exactly. Why do you do it yourself? - We can not read. Nor write. All that. - Yes. Say so. Beware the Tyrant. - He is very tyrannical. What makes the invisible visible. Got it? Wake up, Ed. Wake up. Look. Where's Lucy? All awake. - Get up. I said get up. This way. - Hurry up. The magic BOOK MAXIM TO CHOOSE PAIN HEALS A MAXIM TO FORGE With these words should sew your tongue. So there will be snow everywhere. An infallible spell to make you make the person you've always wanted to be. Susan, what's wrong... on? I am beautiful. No, wait. Make me one I want to be. A magic spell to the invisible visible. If the 'p' in psychology, the 'h' in psychiatry... invisible ink and the truth in theology. Lucy's dagger. Stop right there or die. The spell is complete. Now everything is visible. What kind of creatures are you? - Great. With the head of a tiger and the body of another tiger. With us you will not have problems. - What? Otherwise, I scratch your death. I stick my pitchfork as through you. I will crush you with my teeth. - I'll bite you with my fangs. You mean crush us with your fat bellies? Fatty bellies? - Our tickle in your toes? What have you done with my sister? Calm down. - Where is she? Can I tell him? - Tell him, chief. In the manor. - What house? That mansion. I am tired of you I always leave. The thing came back. This place is weirder and weirder. He calls us weird. Your majesty. - Caspian and Edward. This is Coriakin. It's his island. That he thinks. You have wronged us, magician. I have not wronged you, but you invisible protection. Protection? Tyrant. I have not bullied you. - I did you can do. If you had wanted. - Get out. What was that? - Cotton. But tell them that. What were those things? - Dufflepuds. Of course. Stupid of me. What did you mean when you said you give them invisible to their own good? It seemed the easiest way to protect them. Against evil. - You mean the fog? I mean what lies behind the mist. That's beautiful. I mean for a fake card of a false world. Here is the source of your problems. The Dark Island. A place where evil lurks. It may take any form. It can your darkest dreams. It tries to get rid of all goodness. The light from this world to steal. How are we against? - You must break its spell. That sword that you wear, there are six other. Have you seen them? - Yes. Are the six Lords come through here? - Yes. Where are they going to added? - What I've sent them go. Break the spell. You must follow the Blue Star... to Ramandu's Island. There the seven swords Aslan's table to be deposited. Only then can they truly magical power released. But beware. You will all tested. Tested? You sword down to the seventh performs having evil prevails. It will do everything in his power is to tempt you. Be strong... do not be tempted. To the darkness outside to beat... you first need the darkness in yourself defeat. By whatever reason... We followed the advice of a senile old goat... who do not even have a razor and hops around in an evening gown. So we're back in the bathtub and and lost in a storm. Brilliant! Three iron to starboard! Consecutive 14 days as a pancake be reversed and no land in sight. My only consolation is that everyone feels just as miserable as me. Besides those boastful, Talking rat... He is such a type in which the glass always half full. We're stuck here... with half rations, we have food and water for two weeks. This is your last chance to return, majesties. There is no guarantee that we quickly blue star will be... especially in this storm. This place is like searching for a needle in a haystack. We can thus pass to sail the end of the world. We can be eaten by a sea serpent. The crew gets nervous. We sail on foreign seas here... so I've never seen them myself. You, sir, like itself may to tell Mr. Rince... that we search for his family responsibilities? I go by. Just a warning... a sea can sometimes do bad things in the minds of the crew. Very bad. Change my reflection to perfection... with natural colored lips. Let me see who I want to be, preserve the beauty of me. Ladies and Gentlemen, Mrs. Pevensie. Edmund? - Beautiful, Sister. As always. - Peter! Sorry madam, may I make a picture? This mother will love it, all her children on a photograph. Laughter. - Wait. Where am I? Where's Lucy? - Lucy, who is that? Susan, what's going on? Come on Madam, a nice big smile. Edmund, I think I'd rather go back. Where? - To Narnia. What is Narnia? - What is going on... stop this action immediately. Lucy. - Aslan? What did you do, child? I do not know, but it was awful. You have chosen yourself, Lucy. I did none of that, I wanted just as nice as Susan. Nothing more. You wished yourself away, and so much more... your brothers and sisters would Narnia do not even know if you were not around. You have as first discovered remember? I'm sorry. You doubt your own value, do not walk away for who you are. Aslan? Father. Edmund. Come with me. Join me. Edmund? Lucy. I can not sleep. - Let me guess. Bad dream? Or we are all crazy, if someone is playing with our minds. It seems strong that the Lord stopped here, Here there is no sign of life. When you are forced to come ashore, please take your men and look for food and water. The three of us searching for clues. - We celebrate sure? Please do not send me back to that rat. - I heard that. Big ears. - I heard that too. Look. We not the first on the island. The Lords? - Could be. What do you think is down there? Let's find out. What is that? - No idea. It looks like a golden image. He firmly in cases. Poor man. - You mean, poor Lord. The character of Lord Restimar. - And his sword. We need them. Be careful. Your sword is not changed into gold. - Both swords are magical. He did not determine what was happening. Maybe, or maybe He was onto something. What are you talking about? What are you looking? Who has access to this pool, is the richest man in the world. Lucy, we will be invaluable rich... no one can tell us more what we to do or with whom to live. You can take anything from Narnia, Edmund. Who says? - I. I am not your subordinate. Here you have been waiting for. To me to day. You doubt my leadership. You doubt yourself. You're just a child. - And you're a weakling. Edmund? - I'm tired of playing second fiddle... First it was Peter, and now it's you. You know I am braver then you two... why did you Peter's sword? I deserve my own kingdom... I deserve to govern. - If you think you're so brave... prove it! No! Stop it! Both. Look at yourself. Can you not see what happens? This place has brought you into temptation... it has bewitched you, this is exactly what Coriakin meant. Let's get outta here. Yes, follow the blue star, but imaginary, to the island of Rabandoedoe... Like the seven steak knives on the table of a talking lion. Nonsense. What is that? I think I'm dead? You are in any case be dead. That you do not need. Finally, a favorable turn of the adventure. What foods have you found? It is volcanic, majesty. Nothing grows. Where is Eustace? He surely is not here to help us. I have a bad feeling about this. I'm going to find him. I go along. Eustace? A treasure. Problems. Of Eustace. No. I'm sorry. - He was just a boy. I had never allowed to leave. What would have happened to him? Here? Of everything. And he was not the first. It's Lord Octesian. We should be... sword found. What was that? Is the volcano? No, that's not a volcano. All hands on deck. Archers, arm! Step forward and wait for my signal. What does he do? - Shoot! He will break the mast. Exactly. Shoot. Edmund. Edmund! - Lucy. I AM Eustace Are you kidding? He should treasure the deceived. Everyone knows that Drake is a treasure enchanted. Everybody here anyway. He's back to change? - Not that I know. Aunt Alberta will not be happy. Sorry about the hand. I can sometimes be quite confident, however. The boats are ready. - We can not leave him. On board is not, Your Majesty. You go with the boat. The rest stay here until tomorrow... and find a solution. - You have no food. And no means to keep warm. What did you say? I've never seen these stars. Neither do I. We are far from home. As a boy I wanted to the end of the world sailing. To have my father to find. Maybe it is. I miss my mom. I have mine too. You'll do it again. How do you know? - Just believe. Aslan helps us. But Aslan could not help it she was taken. We find her, I promise. In one way or another. Difficulty sleeping? It does not entirely bad. I stay awake with you, to keep you company. You believed this morning fixed not even dragons. Extraordinary things happen only by extraordinary people. Maybe it's a sign. That you have a special destiny. Something bigger than you could imagine. I can tell an adventure to spend time. You are not the first dragon I meet. Many years ago, longer than I remember... I was at a group of pirates and I met another dragon. Much wilder than you. Wake up. Look. The North Star. Everybody up. - What? It is the blue star. - Wake up. Draw. Throw your whole body into it. Draw. The wind has died down. How do we now Ramandu's Island? It seems that something does not want us there. Draw. If I get more hungry, I eat at the dragon. Quiet, Eustace, they will to deal with me first. Als we tegen de nacht geen land vinden... Wat hebben we geraakt? Eustace, dat is geniaal. Naar Ramandu! We kunnen niet zeker zijn dat de andere Lords Ramandu's Eiland bereikt hebben. Je hebt ons hier gekregen. Wat zei ik? Buitengewoon. Wacht. Lord Revilian. Lord Mavramorn. Lord Argoz. Hij ademt. Zij ook. Ze zijn betoverd. Het is het voedsel. Het is het stenen mes. Dit is de tafel van Aslan. Hun zwaarden. Op de tafel. Dat zijn er zes. We missen er nog een. Kijk. Reizigers van Narnia. Welkom. Sta op. Zijn jullie uitgehongerd? - Wie bent u? Ik ben Lilliandil. Daughter of Ramandu. I am your guide. You're a star. You're very handsome. I can change shape as distracting. - No. Please. The food is for you. There is enough for everyone that welcome to Aslan's table. Always. Go your way. Wait. What happened to them? These poor men were half crazy when they reached our shores. They threatened each other with violence. Violence is forbidden at the table. So they were put to sleep. - Will they ever wake up? If everything is restored. We have little time. The Magician Coriakin told you Dark on the Island? Yes. Soon be no evil to stop. Coriakin said, to break the spell, we need the seven swords on the table. That is the truth. - But we found only six. Do you know where is the seventh? There. You have courage. Do not waste time. How we meet again? Goodbye. What will we find? Our worst nightmares. Our dark desires. Pure evil. Tavros, release the arms. Archers, make you ready. Insert the lanterns. We are ready. When I get big, I would just like yours. If you're great... you just like you. If we do not make... whatever it is... I consider you my brother. Me too. You have your sword reported. He was not mine. Take this. But it is... - Peter would like. Here it is, my friend. The battle is coming. Eustace, no. Wait. Stop. I do not accept surrender. A true warrior flight out of fear. Look at me when I talk. I'm a mouse. You a dragon. You have a skin of leather. You breathe fire. Come on, we'll meet our fate. What happens here... every soul standing before me, has been deserved place on the Dawn Treader. Together we traveled far. Together, we have undergone setbacks. Together... succeed us again. Now is not the time to meet you fear to admit. Be brave. Never give up. Our world, our lives Narnian depends. Think of the lost souls we rescue. Think of Aslan. Think of Narnia. - For Narnia! For Narnia! Helene? We can see no sense. The fog is too thick. You're a big disappointment for me. You call you my son? Behave yourself about it first. Edmund. Come with me. Be my king. I let you prevail. - Go away. You're dead. - "You can never kill. I will always be alive in your mind. No! - Edmund? Are you okay? Stay away! Stay away! - Who is it? We are not afraid of you. - Who are you? Stay away! - We're not leaving. You beat me. His sword, Caspian. Rhoop lord. You have me! - Retreat. We'll get him on board. Fast. Quiet, Lord. - Get off me! We come not to do harm. I am your king. Caspian. My Lord. You should not have come. There is no escape. Quickly turn this ship before it is too late. We have the sword. We go. We turn around. Do not think. Let your fears do not know or she will use against you. Oh no. - Edmund. What did you like it? - Sorry. What is that? It's too late! It comes to the boat. Come, walk. Do not disappoint me. Do not give up. For Narnia! Suit. And that. Eustace, hold on. Go away, being! - No. Eustace! Go on. - We are doomed. Turn the boat around. - Stop him. Rowers. On your rowing position. At top speed. - Aslan, help us, please. Draw. Pull with your whole body. Where are you? Stay here until someone comes to collect. We crush him against the rock. To port, I try to lure him. Watch out! Draw. Try to kill me. I'm here. No! - Edmund. I'm still here. Keep you down. Aside. We can beat this. We must get closer. - Everybody to the main deck. Get ready. I want everyone here. Ready... now! On his head! Heave! What are you trying to prove, Edmund? That you are a man? Do it! I can make that. I can get to my king. Just take my hand. Just leave it behind. Do it! Come on! No! The magic... leaves. Look. Narnian! Mama! - Helene. Mama. We get them on board. We did it, but I had expected. We were not alone. I'm here, Lucy. Here, Lucy. I'm in the water. I am a boy again. A boy! I see your wings are gone. Where sky and water meet. Where the waves are sweet. It's sweet. Look. The land of Aslan. We have to close. We are now so far. How did that feel, Aslan then changed back? How I tried, I could not do it myself. Then he came up to me. It was some pain, but... It was a positive pain. Like a thorn from your foot you would attract. A serpent was not all bad. I was a better dragon than a boy. Sorry I did. It does not matter. You were a pretty good dragon. My friends, we're here. Aslan. Welcome, children. You have done well. Very good. You have come a long way. Your journey is now over. Is this your country? - No, that is behind it. Is my father in your country? - That you find yourself only. But if you go, You can not go back. Are not you going? My father would certainly not be proud I would state for which he died. I want what I been too long deprived, rather than what was given to me. I've got a kingdom. A people. I promise a better king. - You are al Children. It is time to go home. You did great here. - That is true. But I love home and our family. They need us. Your majesty, I'm dreaming so long your country to see. I have had many adventures, but nothing could satisfy that desire. I know I'm hardly worthy, but with your permission... I lay down my sword your country to see. With my own eyes. My country was created for noble hearts like yours. However small that heart is. Your majesty. - Nobody deserves it more. It's true. Can I? - I suppose to do... Goodbye, Lucy. Not weep. I do not understand. I'll see you again. What a great puzzle is you. And a true hero. It was an honor to be next such a brave man to fight. And a great friend. This is what I needed. This is our last time here, huh? - Yes. You are big. Like Peter and Susan. - You visit us in our world? I will always keep in mind. How? - In your world... I have a different name. So you know me. That is why you were brought to Narnia. Because here's what I get to know, You know me better there. We meet again? Yes, dear. On one day. You are closest to me as family. And you belong to. Thank you. Will I ever come back? Narnia may need you again. What you doing up there? Poems Jill came along. We talked a lot about Narnia the day after. And when my nephew and niece off... After the war ended... I missed them with all my heart. Just as I know Narnian miss them all. For eternity.
