BLADE MAFlA. 4 members in a family commit suicide! BLADE MAFlA;S ENCOUNTER. Careful! Watch out. -Your parents and kins have arrived. -ls it? Why do you cry then grand ma? Mom! Mom! Dad! Mom! Dad! Very tragic incident! Narayanan Namboodiri who is a priest in the temple... ...his wife and children died by taking offering of the deity... ...mixed with poison. His young daughter is alive and she is here as witness. Kindly tell us what has happened? He is my brother with his wife and kids. They had problems for them. He has borrowed money for interest. He has mortgaged this house and land to him. The guy came here and created havoc for his money with interest. He threatened us that he would vacate us forcibly. He told then, that he would stay here. My brother was very innocent. He couldn;t imagine such a scene. He gave poison to them... leaving her alive! What about the one who gave away the money and caused this tragedy? A Purushothaman! He has pet name called Parunthu.(Eagle) He is a cruel guy. Kunjachan! Do you have any more chicken legs? Chicken has 2 legs only. You had them. ls it? l wish if the chicken has 4 legs! Our place is infested by awesome financiers! Many families are ruined because of these people. Those going out of the place and ... ... those being jailed for some reason are many. These Blade mafias are a threat to the land... ...causing fear and challenge to our society. Stop it, will you? You nasty girl. They get money from me on interest... ...and they ignore me later if asked. Cunning people! lf you die later to evade me, you are the loser. They can;t do anything to me. Blade mafia, threat, devil, culture...goddamn girl! Get off. That;s it. The dead one is the loser. l am the least affected. l;ve the documents of their house and land. lt;s all for me. What do you think of me? -l appreciate you! -Do you? This place is to acquire for the bus stand. That place is going to be mine. You have to show your real merit. l need only a word from you. Who has filed the case by the way? -Parunthu! -What? ls it Purshothaman? Are you scared when you heard the name? You have to be cautious when you tackle him. l have to be serious in this case. Do you know that the price of this land... ..will increase 10 fold in future when... ...the bus stand matter reach the people? Kozhikkode of future is right here. We should get that 21/2 acre to make it a square land. lt was when Beeran koya the owner of the plot showed disinterest in this. He is not ready to sell this plot for a higher price. Do Parunth know about this? Vijayan is the Binami! The broker is some nasty Mahendran. l don;t allow Parunth to win in this. The registration should at the time mentioned. ...not in the binami Vijayan;s name. ...in my name...Kallayi Aseez;s name. He is not going to do wonders with that 2 acre land. He just want to play a foul game. His action is to be curtailed there. -Who do you think l am? -Of course. Even if you are the binami some land could be in your name. -Good. -lf you go away with the land by cheating me... ...l'll insert the knife in your throat. Who can beat you? -Whom do you think l am. -Smarting. -That's it. Registration should be in the morning. Pujappura Mahendran will arrange things. Aseez deserve this. Victory is ours. What is this? That is it. See how Rajini is attacking them! Go ahead with your attack. My legs and hands are shivering! The checker is coming. Keep the girl on your lap. l have not bought the ticket for her. She is only 11/2 years old. Somebody wants to see Mahendran boss. lt's very urgent. How can l go when a tough fight is going on? lt could be some beneficial matter, go out and see. l have to oblige to what she has said... ...as l am a castrated one. Let Rajini brother doesn;t know this. He will be annoyed if he know it. Let us go. Mom! You were asking for this. -Maha vendra(Smart guy)! -Am l one? Yes, you ungrateful! lt was my fault. You know well about Purush. He told me to stand with him in this sale of land. He will be annoyed if not. Then he will remove the nuts and bolts in my body. l was caught with him. Pardon me. l know you smarty, since you came from Trivandrum. How dare are you to cheat me and give the outcome to him and enjoy your life. l will stamp you! l am here after a hernia operation! Damn you! What is your problem? Are you trying to out smart me? When you have bought a land there what stops me from buying a land there? Pestle! Why all these acts? lf it is money, l could give you as much you need. lf you join hands with Parunthu and try to defeat me... ...you are wrong. Beeranikka! Should l tell you in person? You know well that l sell this as l am in very much trouble. l am glad f you could give me 1 rupee more. But you settled the matter with them by fixing an amount. You both are the same who have signed the agreement. A grand party for Poojapura and Vijayan Chicken biriyani from Bomby hotel... ...and fish cutlet from Paragon hotel! You can be here enjoying all these. They will be here to take care of every thing. Beeran can come with me... ...to register the plot in my name. You can then go back to your house getting the money. Puli! Send this agreement to the heaven. -What is this? -l got some eggs. l cooked it as you like it. l wonder when you will give poison to me and kill me. Don;t say such a harsh comment which hurts the mind. Do you really have the pain in your mind? You don;t know about women, that;s why. l know well. l know it since my child hood. l got the knowledge from my mother at first. Women are a nasty specimen. l heard that your husband is staying with a women somewhere. l don;t care if he lives with her or die. But he wouldn;t come to me asking for this house. That is property and wealth. lt is money that matters. Which will not fly above the money? Won;t it matter if l tell the name? -Tell me who? -Parunthu. That is the other Parunthu which does not fly over the money. This will fly over the money and descend on it. That is Parunthu Purushothaman. Love, tears and sort of, will not work out with me. lf l wish, l;ll either join or disjoin. That's all. Take out a mat. Let me sleep. Don;t sleep there. What will happen if l sleep here? Neighbors are annoyed! They didn;t ask me any money. l too have not given any money to them. Why are you bothering then? -Who is this? -l am the contractor Divakaran. Where are you calling from? Today the flash is washed out. The box is emptied out. l have stopped it and coming. l will get back in another sitting. Can you come over here? l have with me a few 1000 rupees notes to give to other party. You know well that l'll keep up my word. l can;t break the promise given to them. ...and you shouldn;t break the word given to me by you. l have just arrived here. lf l finance the gamblers, l need not wait... ...till the beginning of the month. ...if given in the morning, l'll get back in the night... ...and vice versa. That is the beauty of it. Who do you think l am? Take it. l have earned this with difficulty. These rupees are more valuable than your attractive body. 1000 rupees, they are. lf you drink and play the cards, you will lose the money. Shall l pour a little for you? No. Liquor is dangerous and harmful for body. lt is a costly matter. Kurukan Kumarettan is the right person for that. Have it buddy and enjoy. -lt is a sucker punch for me. -You are already in it. lt is 1 lakh. Give me back in the evening. Sign 2 checks and give it to me. Don;t play, or drink. Be good. l will come in the evening. to get it signed by you. ..for the registration of a small land. Will you register the whole Kozhikkod market place? No, l deal only in the simple matters. Learn from him how to make money. He gives out money in huge interest ...we need their help in a time of urgency. We can;t expect any help from any others. Our social, financial culture has changed a lot. These anti socials make money from our weakness. ...and the poor become poorer. That is lndia! -Purushan! -Do you wonder who l am? Do you want to see the rest? l will show it. We want to have a good look at you. You have seen me. Shall l go now? You can;t go just like that. Why do you ask for trouble? Take off the hand. What if l didn;t? -l'll show you then. Purushan! We have failed here. ls it so? l am here involved in a fight. -Who is hitting you there? -Aseez. Vijyan was scared to tell you. He called me up and told things. Aseez has done the registration of that land. Poojapura Mahendran have changed the sides. My dear. You are really smart! ...but l wonder when will my death ceremony be. Then... You glutton! lt is the money a devil gave me... ...to cheat another devil. Lord Padmanabhan! Purush will hit me and make me into 3 pieces. We get money from him We give it to others for 5 or 10 percent interest. Forget it if he didn;t give. You join with Aseez. You will find a way for every thing. There is only a way to go. Fill the mouth with cloth. So that the people won;t hear when l cry out in pain when Purush hit me. You have enough money now. Never mind if he hits you! We have 2 daughters! You are the real woman. She is keen on our children;s safety than her own husband. l deserve a cruel woman like you to be my wife. Lord Sri Padmanabha swami! lt was not a deliberate act. When l was hit badly l had to do that with out hesitating. l pledge on the Lord! Even if l had to die, l won;t leave Purush and go. You have to pardon me. l have two girls for me. l wouldn;t pardon you thinking of your wife and kids. l didn;t want to go to jail after killing a dog. Heard you dog? l have a toothache. This money is given by Aseez for cheating me. -Let it be with you, right? -Yes. This money is mine now. Keep it. Real estate business in Kozhikkode is flourishing. -Mine it. Tell it to Aseez. -l have a bad head ache. l am not with Aseez any more. All l have is only you. l will come to your house. Certainly l'll come to your house. Allah will bless you! So that land is also mine. l had to do Something to Parunthu. He vanished after getting some money from me. ..Sulaiman haji of Monjathi Textiles! l didn;t get any interest or the principal. On God;s name, l'll see to you. Then... Hit. Move. -Hit. -Move. -Have you won? -l was not defeated. Don;t get defeated. lf so, l wouldn;t have any opponents. You have send me your boys to kill me. We had a fight then. They tried their best to thwart me. Aseez! lt is not a fight which will come to an end so easily. My mother tried to get abortion when l was in her womb. lt didn;t happen. l think it is too late. Which means your mom has tried to kill me first. Many tried in many ways. Now it is you. l am a villain and the hero is you in this story. ...and vice versa. Really we two are villains in this. There is no history in which the villain has won. This is the earth. This is where, you and me will end up our lives. This is lndia. This is Kerala. Kozhikkod is some where here. We will be there for quite long time! Manancherra, Mudala kalam, stadium ground... ...Kallayi river, Kutticherra and all... ...will be in our business activity. The people over here should watch our activity. We too have to meet quiet often! We should...! Aseez and you are equal to me. Our deposit should be safe and we should get a good interest. That's why me an M.L.A and this police officer J.J are in this matter. lt is not to make you good. You can become good along with us. lsn't it so? Yes! l am just a plant beside you, a banana tree. l was like that before. There is nothing new about it. l called you say that! Aseez called up. Kumaran has come to represent him. l know Kurukettan is his decoy. l have a name for me. lt is not kurukkan but Kumaran! l am Purushothaman and people call me Parunthu. Having a name means to become popular. -Who won't like it? -l like it. Come to the matter without playing! You give to these people who are the VlPs. They are unknown to the world.... l promise on you, l wanted to tell you myself. Blade mafias are being keenly watched by the government. MLA sirs like him, Ministers above them and.... ...the chief minister above them... ...form the government. Take courage sir. lt is not that. Blade mafia has a drastic end. Smarties like you have vanished too. lf anything happens... lt is the money we got by bribery and got by force. Your money will be safe if l have to die for that. Enough? Shall l go now? No doubt of it. lt is fixed. Damn MLA and Cl... and cunning Kurukkan! l'll show you who l am. 97...98...99... Why have you stopped it, you damn? l told Purush brother that it is my mistake. He has pardoned me off. Or else, l should stop the blade activities. ...and lead a life of a saint by getting a gun and a house on rent. l doubt if l could be possibly fit into it. You ungrateful guy! You won't get fit if you go to the bar. You know, the time when l had a tiffin stall... ...l borrowed 5000 rupees from Purush on interest. The money and interest mounted up. He came to me very much annoyed. He smashed out the stall. He managed to dumb me here. l became the mortgaged property of him. He was annoyed and hatred at first. Then every thing was normal after that. He is looking after well as l have nowhere to go. l am thankful to him for that. -You don't have it. -What? -Gratitude! -Where did we stop it? -Gratitude. No.99 You can start again. 102...103 ....104...105... Why this to him? He has his food here... and the affection is for him. He should not be allowed to enter this house. lf he get some money... all are like that. lt can be Kunjachan or me. So, you need not believe anyone or expect from him. You need not love anyone. That's all. No point in blaming others. My time is not good. Every thing has to be made correct. Ask the astrologer to come here. -What? -Let the astrologer come. Lord! Mother! Save me. Tell me something. l feel uneasy. l feel uneasy. lt is a difficult time for you and you have obstacles. -Who is it? -Panikker. l was telling that Purush feel uneasy... ...when Panikker was not telling anything. Who is it Panikker? Not one. Among them strong and weak people are there. There are lowly and virtuoso people there. ...there are men and women and foreigners in that. They are trying to thwart our work, the world over. Some are lurking around us without any shame. When did you dance with the kavadi? ..it could be 5 years back. -What's it? -lt is the kavadi. l got it. The dance! That has not happened here after my arrival. Fight, frighten up, marriage, feast... ...and the stoppages of these, kidnapping and mortgages.... ..these are happened here. The dance was never performed here. lt is not a dance. lnstead it is a worship! The worship for the blessing of God. l got it. We too do worship like that. -Alleluya! -Stop it. Kavadi only will not be enough. lt should be spear in it. The spear! l have an allergy for iron! lf touch the iron, the problem will start there. That's okay. You have suffered 3 stabs! l will go to the doctor and have medicine. lt is not that. l have to go to Palani. Getting an allergy is definite. Destroy all the evil matters. Oh goddess! Science tells the bodies of such kind are exempted. ...but one who is having blood relation of you. l don't know the whereabouts of my father and mother. Anyone who is interested in your growth... ...and who stays with you, is enough. The epic says so. What about his religion and caste? God has no religion or caste. So it is Kunjachan only as per the saint. lf he goes to Palani l will be in trouble. Why don't you go ahead with your worship without going to Palani. lt will not work out. We have to go to Palani and carry kavadi. l woud touch the currency with hand. Give a little to your disciple. l can't do that. All evil things will vanish with this! -Come. -Pityful! Take care if you are not taken away by the god of death. That's his problem! He gets the money and advises him as he is a fool. Hail Lord Surbamaniyan! O peacock! Come dancing before the deity bearing the flower kavadi(flower arch)! O peacock! Come dancing before the deity bearing the flower kavadi! Pandi drums! lrony drums! O peacock! Come dancing before the deity bearing the flower kavadi! Come dancing! Come with high spirits with sandal like divine lingual. The glittering stud of the smart guy shines as per the character. The glittering stud of the smart guy shines as per the character. He is a wanton with anger in him! He is a brave guy to face the opponent. Peacock! He will acquire what he wants. God! He will take out the spear to ruin the enemy. With the feathery kavadi on the shoulder has come. O peacock! Come dancing before the deity bearing the flower kavadi! lt starts to go away from the way. His neck is shining with the chain! lt starts to go away from the way. His neck is shining with the chain! He is a rowdy who stands in the front. He is a friend with lots of guts! Divine being! You sown in and harvested and filled up the room. You are the hero who can make crores! You are the Aadi kavadi who changes place. O peacock! Come dancing before the deity bearing the flower kavadi! Come dancing! Come with high spirits with sandal like divine lingual. Hail Lord Subramanya! You look as if in a good form. Why do you cry? Will you spoil things? When seeing you with these decorations... ...l feel sad as your mom is not here. lt is okay. She might be seeing from the heaven. -You have not understood anything dad! -What? She has decorated herself with some reason. Sister's prince is coming! Let Vineet bhai shiver when he sees your stunning beauty. Oh my loving child! Come on. Have you drunk a little on the higher side? lt is my daughter Rakhi's birthday. This is the right occasion to get drunk. -Do l look like one? -Yes of course. Haven't you gone to bed? Don't you have class tomorrow? Dad has got drunk very much today. Doctor has said that.... Dad knows all about it. Our property, dad's peace of mind ...and our future... ...are on top of the court table. Hold the box. Please don't do this to me. You have to give me some more days. l will settle the loan by then. ...only 5 days permission! On Christ's name, don't send my family to the road. l will touch your feet. He has come, and you can tell it there. You have taken a long time to do this, my boys! The things should go along like the crackers! My family and me have to commit suicide! Don't do this to us. Suicide is a fashion in our land. lf you don't like to live, go and die. Don't waste the time. Go and die. When you are in need of money you come to me. Really who is the one that cheats the other? ls it you who spent the money, or me who asked it? Go and die. l have seen enough cremation grounds! Come man. l won't agree...even if l had to die. Get away from me. How dare you could touch my dad? l shall touch you then. When you have a nice girl for you like this... ...why do you bother for money? You could give her to the natives for a touch. -What is this? -What? That's what l asked you. What is this? -Can't you see? -l saw it. We will give it if we had to give you money! Who are you to beat him for that? Boys, isn't she our Hemant bhai's girl? You need not ask the people for that. l am the same. You Bhai's girl....! Your dad's time is finished what more than this. How dare you talk things to me like this? But l will give him too! Do you know who she is? Her dad owed me lakhs of rupees. l thought, to avoid quarrel with him even the agreement time finished. But her daughter is acting big. Start the car. Come and get in. Tell me. ls it Purushettan? We will decide later if it is Ettan(Elder brother) ...or aniyan(Younger brother). l am coming to your house. The marriage proposal of my sister in my house today... l know that. We could decide about my matter fast if it is in your house. lt will be before a few people, right? -When did you come? - Just now. Have you started it in the morning itself? What shall l say Kunjikka? When they want money, l am like God for them. They bend their head with respect. ...but nobody is willing to return the money with interest. They blame me for nothing. They call me robber, knife, blade etc., The earnings from interest will not stay for ever. You know it from my experience. Now you and Aseez wanted to collect interest. With hotel and timber business, l was a boss myself. Now, l am begging for a tea. You could as well come to me. What for? My leg is being cut up to the knee. The pus is still climbing up! Can you able to share my pain? You and Aseez are brought up like my sons. Even if he is a naughty guy... ...l would not stand the pain when you both fight each other. What if this leg being cut off instead of this one? The pain of it will be the same. l didn't come for that. l saw your mother in the hospital... ...when l went there for treating my leg. She is suffering from wheezing. Poor thing. She is roaming the temples with a load. Can you allow her to roam like that? She deserve it. She has to endure it. -Kunjachan! -Yes! Prepare food for Kunjikka! l told you Good morning! You need not pay any money for that. You simply have to say it. ...just like telling reasons for not paying the interest. Every thing will be alright. You have a daughter, right? She could make every thing right. Damn thing! What happened? l should have slapped her on the face. l didn't do it as she is a girl. She is an adamant girl. lf she gives you any problem she has to be punished. -She is a young girl. -That is for you. Leave it. Where is my money? My property in Mavoor road which is in a case is waiting for the judgment. Within a month... lt is a property worth 41/2 crores! l will see that your money deal is settled well. lt will be fine if you settle that deal. On the other hand, if l had to settle that... ...the people would not like the scene. What is the idea of coming here now? lt is my daughter's birthday. Birthday will not wait till the judgment of the case. Give me 50000 rupees and help me out. l can't do that. You have borrowed 15 lakh rupees already from me for your case! The principal, interest, and compound interest amount to 23 lakh rupees. Now you need 50000 rupees for your birthday of your daughter. Are you not ashamed to come and beg? You have to live within your limits. There are people here who could give loan on interest! l discourage people who come to me for loan... ...that the interest will go up as a mountain! l know when the case is. l will be there on that day. lf l don't get my money, l'll switch on the A/C and sleep in your bedroom. The house and the land will be mine later. You know well about my cleverness. Go, leave this place. There outside... Should l go out or what....? -Mom is outside. -Whose mother? You are with me for about 4 years. Do l have a mother for me? You foolish Christian! She is craving to see you. l am the out come of her craving once. The women folk instructed me to call her as Kunjamma. You can fool the bigger people, and that is smartness. l have done that, and l do it even now. ...but you should not cheat the son. What has she thought of herself? Does she think that l'll die by falling into a drainage? Now l have grown up and have enough money with me. Do you know why she has come now? ...to get the rent....of her womb. l was in her womb for 10 months. She has come to collect the rent for it. 100 rupees for the rent. 1 rupee as donation from me. Give her 101 rupees and ask her to go to the temple. lt is after all 101 rupees compared to our other expenses. He is in a violent mood.... ...thinking of his money dealings and other things. Hence, l didn't tell him that you want to see him. Even then, he wouldn't come. He wouldn't talk to me. lt is a wrong thing what l have done to my son. -l would not come again to see him. -Take it. Oh lord Siva! Does he have the same bright color? He has the same color now. He is very kind hearted. That is to stay forever. There is no one for him. Don't leave him and go. You have to take good care of him. -ls it Kunjala Haji? -Yes. What is it? l am Vinayan from Kozhikode. 68. You come straight to Kondotti! Where in Kondotti? A gold smith Bhaskaran will call you in your mobile and tell you. lt's okay. Catch him. My bag. lt is okay. Who do you think l am, Moosa? -Where is the money? -l'll send it to the office safely. Ask your Bombay boys to leave Kozhikkod fast. -You know Aseez well right? -Yes, sir. -The visitors time is over. -My time is just started. No. Lie down. What did the doctor say, mom? He said there is no problem in the examination! He took 3 x-ray photos. l wish my son would get better! 68 lakh rupees! Forget it if it is lost. You are well enough, and that's enough for me. People kill for just 1000 rupees these days. You are an exemption! Money will come and go. lt will come again. Poor guy. He seems to be out of charge. We have to re-charge him. We are out of danger. Go to the canteen and have food. Take it. He likes masala dosa(Eats), which you know well. Bring two of them here. l'll take care of him. Never mind! Who don't like money? Who wouldn't like it? Tell me. Where is my money? Tell me who is behind you? Who has instructed you to do this? Tell me. For whom? What did you get out of this? What is your share in it? l promise that l don't know anything. l wouldn't know what happened. Give it to me, sister! l will give him. ln the next 3 days, you have to keep my money at my feet. Or else, l will keep your corpse at the feet of your mother and sisters. Vinayan! You know well about the atrocity of Aseez! After 3 days time, Aseez will kill you. Your dead body wouldn't be retrieved from Kallayi river or Arabian sea! l am not threatening you! What is your idea? You know well that, after my father's death... ..l did jobs of all kinds to evade starvation... ...in this house and to see my sister married. ...but l could not find a suitable solution! lt is after you said that l joined Aseez. He is the son of a teacher. He wouldn't cheat up even a rupee of anyone. l have only a solution now. We will commit suicide tomorrow. Brother! Don't tell things like that. What shall l do then? There is only a way for it. ...the safest way to play with Aseez! lt is Parunthu. Oh mom! lt is long time when l wanted to teach you to hit and catch the ball. lt is like that after some age. You can't learn anything. l don't need a future in this line. Even l too don't have it. Doing exercise in the morning is good for the mind and body! Only then we will have the energy to fight with any body. l will show you that. Do you like dosa and idly for breakfast or Appam and eggs? l like dosa and idly along with appam and egg roast. lt will be better if you had Uppumavu and banana along with. Let it be wheat uppumavu and baked banana. l wonder if he would bake me and eat one day. ls it Gopinathan Nair of Murali motors? -Yes. -How many buses you have what you said? Two. -Father? -What? l asked you how many fathers do you have! You should be in my office at noon today with the principal and interest. Or else, you will find me in your house for lunch. Don't try any tricks on me. That is ... Give me some more time. Stop your talk, you rascal. Are you giving reasons when l ask my money? l have the check of your wife Sri Devi Gopinath. Do you want to see her in the court and the jail? Do you? We will decide that today noon. -What is it? -l have the guy who l said before. Does he want to see me or should l have to see him? He wants to see you. Ask him to come and see me then. Go in and be happy. Pipe money swindler, right? So he has swindled Aseez! Good! Some spies... My boy! You have to learn the trick by trying it on the master who has taught you. That is the style of the under world people. You too have done that. -How much were there? -l didn't take the money. -How much were there? -68 lakhs! Give me that. Nobody will know it. l will manipulate it. An amount will be in your account every month. Leave this place and go elsewhere. l promise on my dead dad that l have no taken any money. Aseez has threatened to kill me. My two sisters and my mother..! Why do you want to keep them with you? ....mom, sister, brothers! Aren't these unnecessary expenses? Wht shall l do now? Get into problems, right? ...Aseez will get wild and come to fight with me, right? l have nobody for me. That is true for every one. No use of having anyone. lf you have money with you there won't be any use of anyone. Try to earn money. l am sure that he is ready to keep you with him. ...l am not sure about that yet. ls it? Right? -Take it. -Take it. Waist band or a foreign watch. Don't use it for unnecessary things. Try not to use it for necessary things. You should use it for only very necessary problems. Come and dance my dear! Come and sing buddies! Come and dance my dear! Come and sing buddies! Dance! Dance! You fly, won't you come to dance? Sing, sing. You bee! Won't you come and sing?

You won't come tomorrow there. 41/2 crores worth property in Mavoor Road. You want to tell me about that, right? l knew before you, that You have failed in your case. Who do you think l am? You cheated me 25 lakhs secretly. You performed your daughter's marriage. You decided to show me your helplessness. That will work out bhai! You have to give me my money now... ...and l will go away from here. Brothers! You are now gone mad taking water in a bottom less bucket. This Hemant bhai is a no.1 thief. Thief. You can cheat your children. You can cheat your son-in-law, his family and the people. But you can't cheat me. What's your problem? Groom! You are in the happy mood of getting married. Your crook father in law owed me 25lakh rupees with principle and interest. You might take it easy... but l have the account for it. lt is money, money! Eagle dare to fly above the money. But this eagle will fly over it. l will land on it. l am Parunthu(Eagle) Purshothaman! You give it now. The moment you give me off my money l will leave this place. -What is it? -l have failed. Why did you play this foul game to us? You ask him. You are very good musicians! ...and it will be useful to you in future to know each other well. Stop talking in English. lf you bother me, l will see to it. -How dare you touch my brother? -Go away! At tomorrow morning at 10 0' clock... ...you should get the money in my office. ...or else l'll take up the house and land which was mortgaged with me. l will decide the future of your girls and you. Pardon me. l have borrowed from him some money for interest. l could not return it back. Case....! l will settle the loan, got from him if l have to sell my land and the house. Nothing has happened to our relationship! Come and have dinner. We shall forget what has happened. Yes we shall forget every thing. We can forget the proposal and the engagement! No one should drink a glass of water from here. We can forget every thing. Come and get into the car. l am telling you to come! ls it a decent family for that? Why are you standing still when the brother is asking you? lf you want to stay with this family.... ...you shouldn't come to our house any more. There is no mother, brother and there is no house for you. Vineeth... All are loving only their likings of their life. Vineeth too want a better life for him. Let him have that. Dad! What have you done dad? You could as well called us too. We all could have done that. Why? Who are you? -l am Raaki, dad! -Who? -Oh God! -Dad. Nothing has happened to us. When you are here, we have nothing to fear about. All are bothering people. l too want to be one. -Dad! -Nasty people! They won't keep me on the earth or take me to the heavens! Dad! Sister! 25 lakh rupees. How can you give me back even if l give you? How will you give me interest every month? The chances are fine,to win the case if it go for appeal... ...and get back the land in Mavoor Road... l can manage to get the documents from Purushothaman! l could get those documents in his custody but that will not be the solution. You have to win the case by selling anything... ...and get the documents in your custody. l can reduce the interest a little. When 2 girls come to my house to seek my help... ...l should help you and save you from Parunthu's clutches. You take courage. l am with you. -Raja... -What? Take them to their house! Always you are counting money! ls it because we have enough money.... ...or is it that you don't know to count it? lt is because we have lot of money. The moment l stepped here, Sri Muruga Financiers... ...is flying higher and higher! lt is not the out come of our hard work. This is the matter of Blade! lt will grow up pretty fast! Others' wrath would mount up along with. lt is not any wrath. People have borrowed money from here for many genuine reasons. Good! You will out smart Parunthu in this way. lt is there. -Where is he? -Who do you mean? Purushothaman! You have to be bit respectful in your speech. ...that too for girls like you! Respect for whom? ls it for him who doesn't know the meaning of it in this birth? ...or is it to you who gets salary from him? Good! Your talk is nice! l didn't come for your conduct certificate. Our documents are here registered in his name! We came to get it back. This is the money for him! -Boss is not here. -Does it mean he is not alive? This case is not a simple one to handle, dear! You look disdainful because of money. Where did you happen to manage it? Money! Why do you bother about it? Dead or killed, you want to fill your box! Let it be. Count the money and give us back our documents. ...The agreement with my dad too! You both have come with money! You ask then for the enlargement of your dad! lf l happen to do anything to you it could lead to a case in the court! Aseez told us that you are cruel enough to... ...talk like this and you wouldn't give back... ...the land and our house! So you have been to him. Now you and your dad could live a happy life hereafter. You have now a man to look after you, and sleep with you! What did you say? Are you talking ill of us after doing these atrocities to us? What are you doing? Leave him! lf you come here again to talk ill of us and do any nasty things... ...l will chop away the hands and legs of you and your dad! Go and get his signature, and give him back the guarantee! l don't need this ...but l follow some ethics, that's why. Not only that. Don't allow these nasty ones to come here again, for this matter. You should get shaved, bathe, dress up and get ready. After sister comes from the office we will go to the doctor! Don't get afraid of anyone, dad. -Hemant bhai! -We call him dad. But l should not call him that. -Dad! -He wouldn't see anyone. What's the matter? You can tell me. As per power of attorney, the house is... ...is registered in Purush's name. We need dad's signature for changing it his name. You were not polite like this when we saw you in office. Situation was like that then. Will you create in this situation, any problems? Who is that another problem? He is Poojappura Mahendran! He is a blade with the side broken! He is a small time financier! You talk as though you are a saint! l know it is not a saint's job! We have to live and let others live! Will it a problem as we have come here? -Will you keep quiet? -l can... ...but the way you talk each other seems to get no where. Lord Sri Padmanabhan! Please take care of them. We will go where we want to go. You can go where you want to go. Shall l? Shall l leave sister? You can go walking. l didn't ask you to come with me. How can l go walking all the way? -You can go walking. -Okay. You had a pleasant scene here ...but lt was a sneaky scene for me. We will have to meet again! You entered the Parunthu's cage with my help. l will see that you are thrown out of the cage. You can watch it. lt is closed. The door to your future is closed. Don't you want to register the house and plot in your name? l am from Purushettan's office. l have come for that. Have you come to kill my kids and me? -l am from Purushothaman's office. -Dad! Leave him. Listen to me dad. Dad! Why do you say sorry to me? For my dad. lt's not you, but it is me to tell. He has finished all by this time. Do it man. You get his signature when he is calm! lf you call me, l will come and collect it. l see! How can you send me off? He has gone to that house only once. ...but an occurrence like this, would never happen. How dare is she and how dare is he? There is something fishy in this, brother. lt is Aseez hand in this. He could have done something using him and her. ...but one thing is sure. They both are in deep love. ls not it? There is a problem in that. The boy is with us and the girl is with the enemy. The path they go is dangerous, right? l am born dangerous, grew up as dangerous... ...and living a dangerous life! What more dangers should come for me? That's truth! But some precautions are necessary. Something has to happen! -l have put salt. -You say it as if you have bombed. Sprinkle some pepper powder in it. lt is not cumin seeds! Vinayan! A call for you! Why is your voice so coarse? l have a bad cold. There is no betterment yet. Why? You told me to call you as you have something to tell me! That is in my boss's house.... Your boss! Damn it. Are you working in his office or doing his house hold work? You can do the household work. l'll keep him for the office work. lt will be convenient for your love drama! You are taking the advantages of it! lt is your girl! Are you his wife? Won't you allow him to do his work? He will do that. We will decide who will be the husband and who the wife is. Me...no... To understand the love between the people... ...you should have the mind and conscience. You are not aware of it. Stop it. Didn't she get anyone to quarrel? Damn her l love you! That is... She could find out fast that it is me. Your hair on your head looks better. lf it is in your food you will detest. lf you want to be here, you will have to obey my words! Or else, you can leave this place. l don't need you for me to live. Understand? Was there hair in his food? He didn't have his food yet. -Has he gone mad? -Oh, no. Aseez! Please don't belittle me. l will bring your money and interest to your office in a week. God promise! lf you don't bring my money in a week' time... ...l'll close down Bappootyka's office. The quotation and agreement are seized by the anti squad! Why do we worry about that, buffalo? We have to... lt was caught in some other case. When Kathina kutty Georeg was dealt with... ...he disclosed many crimes. Along with that, the 68 lakh case which was robbed in Kondotti. Parunthu was behind it. Moosa got handsome money for that. He did his part well. l would not allow Parunthu to fly over the money. You have to play well and get back the money you lost. l will descent here in the morning! Take the check. Take it! He has called me from behind. That will not matter as far as you are concerned. Aren't you going to Malakhapparambil? Stop your fun! What is it? l have lost my game. Give me 5000 rupees! l will give back the money as 6000 rupees. You know well that l will win the last game. l have given all my money. l have only money for my travel expense. lf l give away that...? The biting dog does not need a tail! l will be back before dawn. Go, or else the girl will go to sleep. Why do you spit so hard? -lf l wanted, l would spit on your face. -What? Oldie is lucky enough not to get caught by the god of death. He does not care for what people say. The medical college has found out some problems in her heart. lf there is money, it would help her to undergo some operation. Damn operation! Mix something in her tea! She would go to heavens by that. What is the use of operating an old heart like hers? You won't deny my words which l know well. -l am sweating all over. -l like that. You go and make a black tea for me. Prabhakar! Oh my god! Dear! Who has done this to you? What is the reason for this? He wanted to see how sharp his knife is... ...when he saw my flesh! Wipe away the blood there. l have not come here or you have not seen anything. -You come here. l told you to come. -Leave me grand ma. -You come here. -Purushettan! Leave me grand ma. Purushettan! Stop. Stop. Take me to some hospital. Take the vehicle. l am stabbed... by somebody. You have to help me. Who is there with you? We need blood. You have to buy these medicines. There is an operation for you. l have no money with me. What if you say that? Tell me if you need any help from me. -Can you sell it for me? -Why not? We are only human beings! We can't predict anything what would happen next! Pray to God and sleep. l will be back soon. lt is long time since he went for medicine. He has not come yet. You shouldn't believe any strangers. l think he wouldn't come back. l am coming sir. Shall l make a call? You don't have to pay the bill for me. l won't do that. Vinayan! l can't. l am in the baby hospital for a stab injury. l can't. l will die away. Are you sleeping while standing? ...or did some guy enter your heart? -What? -l am going. Going? Why? Nothing. -l will drop you. -No. Tell me what it is. l can without telling you. l can take revenge on him. There was a call in your mobile. lt was your boss Purushothaman. He has been stabbed by somebody. l didn't want to tell you. l wanted him to die. My silence would be the cause of a death. My mind does not accept that. My God. -Who are you? -l am his brother. -ls he okay now? -He is not yet. We are late. We need blood for him. You have to buy medicine for his operation. Don't get delayed. God! What shall we do for the money? By the time we call Kunjachan and do what we want.... Take these and sell them somewhere. Will you be here? You should have allowed him to die. He should die a horrible death! That is his destiny. You can;t write off his destiny. l felt like that in that situation. The curses of the entire world is on him. He will die., and l will hear about that. l have to. We have to hear from Purush who is... ...the victim of a stab case. That is why we are here. He has not yet come out of his unconscious state. -What about his condition? -lt is very bad. l will let you know, when he gain consciousness. We thought he would not recover. but after the operation, the condition was better. He is still unconscious. Come. Purushothaman would not be in Kozhikkode any more. You are not worth enough. -Your hand gave out a shake. -When he called my name l was... He has told the police that he could not identify the culprit. Cl JJ sir has told me. He told that he could not find out his motive. -Now... -Forget it if he is not dead. He shouldn't die. He should live through a horrible experience. His wings should be cut off. He shouldn't fly. He shouldn't fly above the city finance business in Kozhikode. Cl JJ sir and MLA Kareem should be with us. They have to be with us. Chit companies and finance companies will be in trouble... ...when hear about his down fall! He could be Himalaya or Everest. The depositors are to be tackled. We should topple over the foundation stone of Purush;s business. l'll take care of it. -Which is the room of Purush? -He is in B2. Sir! We are roaming in this place for a few days. We want to see if Parunthu should be alive or die. Our money is with him. l heard that his condition is better now. lf his condition is worse, we would be in trouble. lf we could not get our money, we will force into his room. That is sure. we will tackle him. Don;t work out any violence. l will manage to get your money from him. Don;t get up. l have nothing to say JJ sir. People are waiting out side. They are interested in their money not your life. l am very keen on getting back my money... ...as well as giving back their money. Good! l came to discuss about that. l don;t want your statement. Today itself l want my deposit money back, and fast. l will give him. JJ will tell the matter. We will stop our agreement and go. What about it sir? You got it to give me back only. You can take it as you gave me back already. Tell me where to bring it. He is very busy there. He can;t waste time as he is an MLA. -How about a drink? -l don;t need any. The accounts of Minmini kunjumol, and Zuhrabi Vattakkinar... ...should be closed and give back the money right away. Should l send it to the house or will any body come to the office? Kumaran will come to the office. -Take care. -What is in it? Whatever we get from a business without any investment is gain! That is my life. You can;t wake up in the morning with one sleep. All are of 1000 rupees bundles, right? Purushettan only has notes more than 1000 rupees. -That is arrogance! -Okay. You are arrogant when you are safe with Parunthu. You shouldn;t think that you can have your life... ...being under the wings of Purush. Your life and your matter only....! Office and bundles of 10000 rupees should be forever! ln the modern social and economic science... ...you are only a new bud in the loran thus family. Loranthus! That suits you better. Start. All should go out now. Get it if you give out. You have to give out when you get it. l won;t get sleep until l sign okay in the account book... ...after getting back my money and give out the money. Which agreement are you talking about? He has come out of the place on his own... ...ignore the doctor;s advise to be there for another week. All are for good only. When your leg aches, you will come to know... ...how far you have walked and how long more you have to walk! Our ideas will go wrong! But if you try, you can make every thing right. When l came out on the road at my 6th year... ...ignoring my mom, l had only 1.50 rupee with me. l held the money tight in my fist... ...without spending it when l felt hungry. l used my strength, smartness, little brain... ...and much atrocities to earn all these! l am ready to earn more. This house is not sealed by anybody. They should be sold away. They have to be sold and settle the account. Then it has to be entered in the account book... ...on all the pages with red ink. He is the loser who;s to give. l have to take another birth as a loser. Kumariyamma! Open your eyes! Come here at once. Oh God! -She is no more! -That;s better. Don;t tell that. -She is your mother. -She is only a woman. A mother has to take care of her children. l never had a mother. l can;t call this dead woman mom! Every thing is over. We have to see what has to be done next. She was all alone every where she went. Let this be too. Let her go all alone. There is a cremation ground in Maavoor road. lf Kunjachan like it, you can cremate her there. Or else the corporation vehicle is there. She has wept before all the Gods! lt is her life which is given in place of yours. lt is her life. She has never kissed me, or gave me any food when l am hungry! She has come here to die at last. She did not know that l am not a loser. She is gone in a little fire. God will not forgive if l didn;t tell that. Life is not a mere pond. That is a flowing river. lt is not the same river which we saw yesterday. There is a change. There is a change in all things in the world. You too should have it. You know that you are here because of a girl... ...who happened to save your life. ...or else you would have taken to Maavoor road. You used to tell that after settling all accounts... ...you used to sign the account book. lt has not happened in mom;s matter. lt has to be there. She has been living with so many wraths on her. You can live alone and die alone! But you can;t go alone to the pyre! At least 2 people should be there to take it there. She was very much perplexed when she was alive. She must be peaceful in the heaven at least. Think it over. Son! Purush! Your deeds done in this soil will... ...bud up and grow into trees! Hollows will be made in the tree... ...and your courage will be hatched in them. The day will come when you will see... ...your image without your head in the mirror. Your deeds done in this soil will... ...bud up and grow into trees! Oh Lord Siva! This is the document of this house and land. l came to return this. My brother, wife and children have died because of you. Can you bring them back to me? Can you do that? Don't come before this lamp at this time. That will be put off. You are wind...a wind storm! Go...go away from here. Your shadow will only bid farewell to you! Fire and thorn only bloom in your path. When you ride on the horse back... Thorn will pierce you and make you agonized. You are born in the earth to conquer! lnstead you will fall dead, when your heart burn down. Dad, be here. l will be right back. Kill me. Kill my children and me! Kill us. Dad! Leave him. No, dad. Come. He will get what he deserves. Come. God will punish him. Dad! Aseez bhai! Lie down there. l am here. l couldn;t do anything for my mom and dad. You would need more money. Don;t hesitate to ask me. Don;t tell him that l am gone. l have a lot more things to do. See you then! Don;t loose heart. Things will happen like this. Every thing will be okay. You have to make it okay. Son! l am not afraid to die. How can l go leaving my children? They will be tortured for those debts incurred by me. He has only ruined all. Parunthu! You have to take care of my children! Who has brought him here? What are you doing here? Are you not satisfied for taking us this far? What do you want now? Will you go now or should l call people to take you out? You..! Me...! How could l forget you? You are some fire works. That girl and me were in love with each other for long. That day you... Your money is dear for you! Other;s life is only after that, right? Why you are here? l was helping them for their financial commitments. Can you think it over about the marriage which was canceled? Their father is in the hospital for some problem! -Tea! -She is my wife! l thank you for your advise. Do you like some tea? Your deeds done in this soil will ...bud up and grow into trees! The eagles fly at a far distance... ...searching for the prey in the ground. The eagles fly at a far distance... ...searching for the prey in the ground. The arrow of the hunter of time... ...writhes the blue clouds that make the eyes close. The hot summer is melting in the path... ...and the heat will swallow up your thirst. Your deeds done in this soil will... ...bud up and grow into trees! Hollows will be made in the tree... ...and your courage will be hatched in them. You didn;t have anything. Why do we take food and go to sleep? To live! ls it the real life we are living in? Life is to rectify the faults you did. How do you say that? Once, l have told Sita of Malekha parambil! ...that the documents are more valuable than her voluptuous body! l mean for the money. What value? Which value? Correct it before you tell her. She will understand it. Where to? Why do you run so fast? Purushettan has come to see me. This is the place where he shed his impure blood. lf he step into our house any more... You know that. There will be a violence here. Stop. You are not yet dead, right? Mortgage principal and interest money. ...along with there is my wife with you, bastard. No! This is between two men... ...if he is a man. -Get in. l will kill you both. -Grandma! l will kill and bury you. Get off from here. Will you go or should l send you off? Should l? Purushettan! Go away from here! Don;t stand here. Don;t stand here. Come. Aseezka! You are here at this time...! You have only lost your dad. We are here for you. lf somebody brings us anything, my dad wouldn;t.... ...wouldn;t like it. He was a proud man! Aseezka is a non-relative of yours! Dear! Take some water and two glasses. Your dad used to drink! So the children should know the feeling! lsn;t it Aseezka? Come. You have spoiled it. Gluttony! You should be patient enough to achieve something. Donkey! That is before. lf we don;t eat anything fast now... ...we should not get anything to eat. Others would have eaten it up! Let me try like this. Why don;t you tell this to him? He comes in when he wanted to. ...that too with friends and drinks! lf you can;t, l will tell him not to come. You should not feel you are alone here. So, l did not bother to see the time to come in. That she has...! She only said the right thing! See you then! The relatives went away when dad had a decline. Few of them became enemies! ...with built up stories and harsh talk! Because we two girls stay here alone. That;s why l came to meet you! lf you didn;t like it. l leave it. Another thing!... the money you owe me! l can come here for that. You can count this arrival is for that. When will you give back my money? That is... lt is nothing like that. lt is like you want to go on the elephant back ...and the people should not watch you. That will not work out for you. Does your sister have a horn by now? l came to know that she has it. lt is the nasty guy who cheated me and joined the enemy army! lt is Purushothaman whom l confronted... ...the one who controls that monkey. l could get away from here any moment. ...but you will get out from here once for all... ...with your cowry shell like sister. You can gain anything from your tears. That won;t work out dear! l will come to the matter straight. l will give you time to give back my money. ln return, l will take your body as the mortgage. When you return my money, you could as well... ...take back your pledged body. How is that? Leave me. Sister! Leave her. You want me to get out of this place, right? No. We will go away. We will go away from here. You should go away. l will send some one to throw you out from here tomorrow. You both will beg in this Kozhikkode market. l will make you do that. lf you want to live up, l will come. Receive me then. Decide that. -How was that? -Get off, donkey! l will teach a lesson for them. Aseez has come here. He took my sister by force. He wants us, according to him. This is the document of my 2 acre land in Thiruvannoor. Fix a price for this, and settle down Hemant bhai;s deal. Let those girls live peacefully. Purushothaman has proved good, like his name. He is very fond of them. Yes! l had been between life and death for a few days. You were not lucky enough for that. But you have given me the chance for that. ...with the help of this cheater. That was good, friend. ln the account book we write our principal, interest and compound interest. We have to write in that a couple of accounts more. One is the price of the soul. The other is the life;s gain and loss account. You should not come there again in the name of help... ...and the money you have to get. l will come there, and sleep with those girls. -So, you would not leave those girls? -No! l didn;t want to win you... but l wanted... ...only not to get defeated by you, always. l have told you before, that we two are the villains of this story. Villains have never won in any story. There is no history of it. l won;t let you live if my finger has life in it. l won;t let Purushothaman to live. l know that you will ask me to go... ...and that you hate me as well! But l have to tell it before l go. Aseez will not come again. But, people will come asking for his money. lf so, l am here to help you out. l too have money to give them. Money, money, money! This Purushothaman is not the one who took advantage of others; life ...for his pleasure. l am the one who God has changed me by my experience. l have done enough mistakes. l asked for pardon to every one. l didn;t get it. Others have to pardon me... ...instead of me pardon others. l ask you to pardon me. Even if l didn;t get it from you... ...l will think that you have pardoned me. Parunthu will fly over it. Not over the money... but over love!! ...over the virtue! l will land over it! l have not bowed down to anyone. l have won at many times. l have won now too. l have won my self! Who do you think l am?
