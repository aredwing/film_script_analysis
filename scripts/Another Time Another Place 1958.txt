A hundred yards from where I'm standing now... the sappers have begun to dig down to the exploding mechanism of the V2... which only an hour ago struck down from the black London sky. This is the first bomb of its kind to land without detonating. You can hear the sappers reporting on their progress. We are nearly down to the warhead already. The dirt is coming away fast. We're going to have to take it easy for a bit. There's a good chance the bomb might shift suddenly. The sappers know in a small chamber behind the warhead of the V2... is the Sterg unit. The wires leading from this complicated mechanism to the firing bridge... will have to be cut to prevent the explosion. - How's it coming through, Alan? - Fine. Thank you, miss. I'm afraid I can't let you through. There's an unexploded bomb out there. I know, but I want to get over to that barricade. You can't do it. Your paper doesn't want you to get killed for a story, does it? It practically demands it. - Well, it's your risk. - Thanks. We have uncovered the hinged panel... which we shall have to open somehow before I can get to the Sterg unit. I thought the angels came after the explosion. Thank you, Sergeant. But I'm from the New York Standard, and that's hardly heaven. - Do you think this will take long? - Well, it's a delicate job. If you're still here, we might be having morning tea together. Fine. I take two sugars. If I were you, I'd take a couple of jumps out of here. There's no telling when that thing will decide to go up. Oh, it looks so peaceful. "Gone to bed. Do not disturb. " What are you doing here, Miss Scott? The same thing you are, Mr. Trevor: Getting a story. Don't you realise that thing can blow this place to pieces any second now? That's the story. Blast. Rain's just what we need. I want to talk to you. - Call me when they get to the warhead. - Right. Hello. I told you not to come down here. This rain is going to make it twice as dangerous. I'll admit it would be cozier in my flat. You'll catch cold, sneeze, and shake that bomb. Then we'll have had it. The sergeant said we could be here until morning. Do you know, if we sit here till then... it'll be the longest we've been together in the last three weeks. We might even get killed together. Doesn't that frighten you? The day I met you, I promised myself I'd spend the rest of my life with you. No matter how short it is. - Does that frighten you? - No. Just as they expected. They cleared the head completely... then the thing slipped down another foot. Can't he wait until the rain lets up? This job's A1 category. That means: "Do it now. " Now... - Well, it's all yours, sir. - Right. You'd better get out of it. Well, we've opened the panel at the back of the warhead. There are all kinds of electrical gadgets... and I can see the Sterg unit. There's a chance the sapper can be electrocuted... - working with the wires in the rain. - That's right. Right, let's have a go at it. You're all wet. - I've heard that before. - When? You recall standing on the dock waiting for an air-sea rescue launch to come... when it hit a mine. No casualties, only some men swimming for shore... one of them being me. Oh, you looked so funny. I'm sure I did, with half of my clothes blown off in the explosion... and all you could do was laugh and say, "You're all wet. " It was your angry expression. Oh, Mark, it's crazy, isn't it? You spend your life looking for love in all the proper places... and among all the proper people. And then there's a war... and you find what you were looking for, just swimming around in the ocean. Half drowned. You didn't help any, either, asking what it was like to be rescued... after coming back from rescuing somebody else. - Oh, you must have hated me. - Professional jealousy. After all, I went out on the launch for a story, and you got the scoop. Most important, I got you. For which I'm eternally grateful. For which I'm eternally grateful. Mark, he's going to cut the wires now. There's a double core cable running fore and aft. The cable is insulated... and I'm having to cut the insulation so that I can separate the four wires. Then I'll have to cut each of the four wires separately. Now I've cut the insulation. Here comes the tricky bit. The sapper is now going to cut the wires. One. Two. Three. One more. Four. That's it. I think I'd better try that again sometime. I'm not quite sure I got the hang of it. Hello? Hello? Sara? Hello! Sara, this is Jake. Hello? Sara? - How long before they call back? - They may not. No one's that lucky. - What's the matter? - Nothing. Why are you looking at me like that? I was thinking about how well I know you... and yet how little. What is there to know, except that I love you? I want to know everything. Where you were born, where you grew up... I was born in a village called St. Giles. It's in Cornwall. And I grew up there. That's all. That's only the beginning. Tell me about it. - I'd rather... - Please, Mark. Tell me. St. Giles? It's a place about the size of my hand. I like small places. I was born in a town like that. All day long you can hear the lonely sound of the gulls overhead... and set your watch by the coming and going of the tides. What did you do there? I went to school, got older, and went to work for the BBC. When the war started, I tried to go into the Army... but they insisted I'd be more useful with a microphone than a gun. You've just jumped a dozen years. The ones in Cornwall? They weren't very exciting. I worked on the fishing boats and studied at night... and lived in a cottage on Tregenna Hill. Oh, Mark, take me there. I want to see all the places you loved. - Meet all the people you knew. - You'd be bored. No, I wouldn't be. - Oh, Mark, never let me go. - Never. - Do you know how much I love you? - I know. Only half. I still have worlds of love to show you. I love you more than I've ever loved anything in my life. Tell me again. - You're a greedy woman, Sara. - Oh, yes. - There's something I haven't told you. - What? About my boss, Carter Reynolds. I've worked for him for a long time. Almost 10 years. And when I left New York, he... He asked me to marry him. I see. It wasn't the first time he'd asked me. But this time you said "yes. " Out of gratitude for so many things he's done for me. Things that I'll tell you about one day. But now I want to tell him that I've found you, Mark. Sara, look... Just tell me one thing... that we'll always be together. Tell me. Yes, always. How long can you listen without answering? You'll give in first. - It sounds anxious. - Weakening? It must be Jake. I should get down to the office. - I'll take you down. - Kiss me first. - See you tonight. - Yes, darling. Goodbye. - Jonesy. - Hello, Miss Scott. What are you still doing here? You should have gone home hours ago. I've had a telegram, Miss Scott. About my boy. - The one in the Army. - Oh, Jonesy, he isn't... Is there anything you'd like me to do? Filing, or typing? I'll give you some stuff I did this afternoon. - Hello, Nancy. - Hi, Miss Scott. - Four copies, and I want them clear. - Yes, Miss Scott. I'm so sorry, Jonesy. Four copies, clear. I'll do them right away. - Haven't you finished yet? - Just this second. Then what are you sitting around for? Don't you know what's happening there? - Darn! I forgot. - Forgot? - You can say that without shame? - I'll be right with you. - Pair of kings. - Fold. - Well, what's the top? - Sky's the limit. A shilling. That's not a very high sky. - Just play. - You're happy. We sent the stuff in so they could put the rag to bed in New York... we're here knocking ourselves out, and you're kibitzing with a bomb. Ante sixpence. - Anything wild? - Nothing wild but the losers. - Anything new? - I'll take three. - Two. - She's got three of a kind. Suffer it. Sara. I bet a shilling. Yes? Someone fell out of a plane and wants Sara to catch him. Who? Oh, that's wonderful, Jonesy. Thanks. The butcher's promised my housekeeper two chops. You know what those butchers are: Full of promises. - What time you eating? - 9:00. Better make it 8:00. - Okay, what have you got? - Full house. Kings and 4s. Why 8:00? Because you've got to be at the airport at 9:30. Sorry, I have a date. The boss is flying in. - Well, he can't be. - Why not? He can afford the fare. It should happen to a dog. I thought he was at Regensburg with Patton's army. He was. Now he's in a plane coming here. - I've had it. Count me out. - She plays one hand and collapses. Sorry. Tomorrow night. Count me out, too. And keep your hands off my money. When the boss flies in, he expects his slaves to be there. I told you: I have a date. - With Mark. - Yes. - So I'll see Reynolds here. - You'll see him at the airport. What's the difference? Sooner or later you've got to tell him. I know. I'm just being cowardly, Jake. What do you think he'll do when I tell him I'm going to marry Mark? - You're what? - That's right. - When did this happen? - Well, I almost asked him tonight. I think maybe I won't go to the airport, either. But he'll understand. Reynolds? He's been known to string people up by the thumbs for a lot less. - You're a great help. - Well, you asked me. I'll be seeing you. Only today I said to Mr. Bunker, I said: "Listening to Mr. Trevor's broadcasts, affects me so, I could burst out crying. " Well, that's nothing to be ashamed of, Mrs. Bunker. They're so good, sometimes even Mr. Trevor bursts out crying. Very funny. - Thank you, Mrs. Bunker. - Not at all, I'm sure. - It's 9:00, Miss Scott. - Thank you for reminding me. I'm sorry, Mark, but I have to run. - Just a minute, Sara. - But I can't, darling. I'll change in a hurry, then we'll have coffee together. Come on, don't look so glum. - Ready for coffee, Mrs. B. - Yes, Miss Scott. Here's your coffee, Mr. Trevor. If you don't mind my saying, so, sir, you look ever so tired. - Yes, I am a bit. - Well, never mind. The war will soon be over, and then we'll all have a nice long rest. Mark, I'm going to have to miss your broadcast. You won't be missing a thing. You know you're not supposed to talk about your work that way. That's my privilege. You're sure you have to go to the airport? When the boss flies in, the whole office goes to the airport. - Besides, I'm going to tell him. - What? About us. And how disgustingly happy I am. He'll throw some fiery glances at me, and whittle away with his sarcasm. But I'm ready for him. In fact, I'm even dressing up for it. You know, I've got to meet a trainload of returning prisoners of war. - Can't you come back later? - No. I won't be coming back. When the war's over, we'll take a holiday together. We'll drive to Spain and rent a villa by the sea. And every morning I'll wake you up and drag you into the water for a swim. Did you say you won't be coming back tonight? Yes. Will you be that late? Come and sit down with me for a minute. - I don't dare, darling. I haven't time. - It's important. All right. That's probably Jake. Hello? Yes, Jake, I'm still here. Well, actually, I'm in the tub and I won't be ready for hours. Okay. Just wishful thinking. You'll pick me up? I'll be ready. Sara, I can't come back tonight, or any other night. Well, if that's a joke... I'm married. My wife's in Cornwall with my son, Brian. I don't believe it. Is there anything more you want done before I go, Miss Scott? No, thank you, Mrs. Bunker. Very well, then, I'll say good night. Good night, Mr. Trevor. I'll be listening to you on the wireless. It can't be true. I've got no excuses, Sara. None. - Why didn't you tell me? - I said I had no excuses. Unless being so much in love with you is an excuse. I couldn't make myself say it. I didn't want to lose you. And here I was, going to the airport to tell Carter that I... I've thought about this until I felt I'd break apart. Every time I saw you, I knew I'd have to tell you. - Mark, what are we going to do? - I don't know. I don't want to hurt you, Sara. I know, darling. And I don't want to hurt my wife and child. What can I say? - Do you still love her? - I don't know. You don't know? But you can make love to me, you can say... Every word I said to you was true. Oh, that's funny, Mark. That's very funny. - I don't expect you to understand. - No, don't expect it. Just tell me to go. - Why? To make it easy for you? - It won't be easy. When you decide what you want to do, you let me know. - Is Sara ready? - In a minute. She used to be everywhere five minutes before anything happened. Suddenly she's late all the time. Come on, Sara. Snap it up. Well, how goes it, Mark-boy? - Couldn't be better, Jake. - Glad to hear it. - How are we for time, Jake? - Lousy. Drop you off at your hotel? Thanks, but someone's coming by for me. Yeah. - Goodbye, Mark. - Goodbye. - What's the matter with you? - Nothing. That guy, Mark... - What about him? - I like the way he looks at you. Like he's waiting for something to happen so he can save you. How long since you've seen the boss? Not since I've been in Europe. I saw him about four weeks ago. He was passing through on a quick flight to India. He mentioned your name. What did he say? He said, "If you see Sara, tell her that if she doesn't get shot in Italy... "or run over by a tank in Africa... "I'll raise her salary. " - He said all that? - Every last word. Somebody must've been holding him down to keep him still that long. Let me in on it, Sara. What's happened? Well, you can tell the boss I want that raise. Only the tank that ran over me was right here in London. - Nothing. - It's never going to come in. Look, it's not going to get here any quicker because you're nervous. - Have some more coffee. - No, thanks. You got it all figured, what you're going to tell Reynolds? I thought I had. Why don't you smoke a cigarette while you're waiting? Hold it. There's more than one plane coming in. I'll see if it's him. - What are you doing in London? - Waiting for the next plane out. - Out to where, sir? - Paris. How much longer do you think the war will last? - When's your birthday, son? - In a few weeks. We'll celebrate it in Berlin with Gen. Patton. Your dispatches come in to New York too close to the line. Watch them. - Where's Sara? - Inside. Hello. What did your fine Presbyterian upbringing teach you, Sara? To turn the other cheek. How are you, Carter? - How's New York, and Finlay, and Mike? - Fine, fine. As you know, I've been working like a fiend. Yes, your column's been improving. It's wonderful to see you. You've never looked better. All ready, boss. Just like old times, catching you between planes. Patton's striking south along the fringes of the Bhmer Wald. He's got an arc of armour and infantry above Regensburg. - You talk to him while you were there? - Got a few words in. - How was the old boy? - Happy. When is he going to meet up with the Russians? He's in radio contact now. Should be any day. Have you got any word as to when Marshal Zhukov will close in on Berlin? Russians don't tell anybody anything, including Ike and the President. How many miles a day are they advancing? It's fantastic. They're advancing 40 to 50 miles a day. Just how much fight is there left in the Germans? Not much. They're surrendering by the thousands. Why are you going to Paris, boss? To talk to McLellan about reorganizing. Then I'm heading for San Francisco. That's the spot to watch for the big news now. Not a new League of Nations? Why not? Because the first one failed? Well, I'll tell you this: By nature I'm a pessimist. A man hands me a buck, I hold it up to the light. But this time, I've got a feeling it's going to work. It's got to. Why does it have to work, Carter? Who are you going to have around the conference table? The same old people? This paper will stand for the necessity of the conferences to work. We'll slap them when they run off the rails... and break our hands applauding when they run straight. There's been enough slaughter. A dead man lying face down in the mud of a field is no answer to peace. That's all for now, thank you. I'll be back from Paris tomorrow afternoon. Get everybody together for a conference tomorrow afternoon. And I want to talk to you. - All right, what's going on? - We're keeping the place running. I mean, about Sara. She's just getting a little tired, like the rest of us. Look, Mr. Reynolds, I just work here. Below was a new wilderness... the wilderness created by the bombing. As far as the eye could see... smoke and flame reached for the jet-black sky. And in the light thrown... ...could still watch for the enemy. Flight Lt. William Briggs... You kept me informed about her. A month ago you stopped. Is that why? I told you, this has nothing to do with my job here. It has everything to do with it. What's his name? Mark Trevor. He's a reporter for the BBC. We'll talk about it on the way to the airport. Another broadcast in the series of... Recordings and Observations of the War... written, narrated, and produced by Mark... That sounded like a good broadcast. I didn't catch the man's name. - Mark Trevor. - I'll remember it. His stuff might make a good column for the paper. Where can I get a hold of him? You don't have to check on him. I'll tell you all there is to know. In fact, I'll introduce you. - How long have you known him? - Almost a month. - How well have you known him? - Very well. - How well have you known him? - Very well. I'll have to look through your letters. Maybe I missed something. - I was going to tell you tonight. - Why didn't you? Do you think you could let me in on the latest now? I wanted to marry him. Outside of the fact that you were coming back to marry me... what's stopping you? His wife and son. Give me a cigarette, please. How long have you known that? I found out about it a couple of hours ago. - You've had a big night. - That's right. A big night. Get a few things ready. I'll take you to Paris with me. - No, Carter. - Why not? Didn't he say he was married? That means he just said goodbye. You're free to travel. - I can't make any decisions now. - I'm making one for you. I'm ordering you to go to Paris. Remember, you still work for me. Well, I just quit! I'm finished. Do you hear that? Yes, but that doesn't change your contract. You have three years to go. I'm holding you to it. But he loves me, Carter. Don't you understand? I'm sure he loves his wife, too. You haven't been punched enough, is that it? You want to go back for more? I want time to figure this out. - And is he going to help you? - Yes. - Did he tell you that? - I know it. I feel it. That's fine. You feel it. - Lf I were you, I'd get it in writing. - Don't. You know I'm right, baby. It's no use. Come to Paris. I can't go anywhere now. Then I'll pick you up on my way back, and we'll head for New York together. What do you say? What can I say? A simple "yes" will do fine. - You really think I'm kidding myself? - I know you are. Sure, I'm just looking for a beating. You're right, Carter, I should know better. Only... - The car's waiting. - I'll be right there. I'll be back tomorrow at 4:00. I'll be packed. Travel light, because we move fast. What have you got? So far, nothing but a headache. Take an aspirin. You've got half an hour. There. - Is it good? - No, it's terrible. If you give me some more time, I can make it worse. What's the matter with you? I'm sorry, Alfy. I just couldn't get going tonight. - Lf you don't think it's really up to par... - No, I think it'll get by. How are you feeling, Jonesy? I feel a bit hollow, Miss Scott. But I'm all right. - Good night. - Good night. - Sure you won't come over for a drink? - Thanks, but I don't think so. - Look, about Sara... - Forget it. - I know how tough it must have been. - Yes. What time do you want to cut the tapes tomorrow morning? I'm going to sleep till 9:00... unless the building falls in. Good night. - Sara? - Alan here. The building just fell in. The Germans surrendered in Italy. - What? Where are you now? - Back at the office. They've accepted all the Allied demands unconditionally. What's our job? We fly to Paris in three hours, and from there, on to Rome. I'll pick you up in front of your hotel at 6:00. I'll be ready. - Can I help you? - Sloane 3718, please. - Would you call Mr. Trevor for me? - Yes, sir. - Tell him Mr. Thompson is waiting. - I'll do it right away, sir. Hello, Sara. - Where's Mark? - Coming down. He told me that you'd both decided to call it quits. I didn't know you were concerned. I've been a friend of theirs for a long time. If you were so concerned, why didn't you tell me he was married? I should have, but... Oh, darling. I tried to stay away. I did everything I could. I've been ringing you. When you didn't answer... I don't want you to leave me. We'll find a way out of this. Tell me you feel the same. Please! Yes, we'll find a way out. How about shoving off? - Where're you going? - The Germans surrendered in Italy. - We're flying to Paris, and then Rome. - No. Let them send someone else. Darling, I have to go. But what about us? We've got to move, Mark. Goodbye, Sara. Just remember this: I love you. You will come back to me, won't you, Mark? I promise. Don't catch cold. Just catch my broadcast, tomorrow morning, 11:00, from Paris. - Shall I make you some more toast? - No, that's plenty, thanks. I had a terrible night. I dreamed I'd lost me ration books. And there was me and Mr. Bunker just wasting away. - That was a nightmare. - It was! Well, I think I'll go and do me kitchen now. I'll get it, Mrs. Bunker. Carter, what are you doing back so soon? I managed to finish my business quicker than I thought. I caught an early plane. Well, you're just in time for coffee. Sit down. I have a lot to tell you, Carter. I saw Mark just before he left for Paris. - Sara... - Please don't be angry... but I'm not going to New York with you. - We're going to work it out, Mark and I. - Sara, listen... - He promised that... - Miss Scott, it's 11:00. - That's Mark's broadcast. - No, wait. What? I don't want to miss it. Sara, before it comes on... I didn't finish my work in Paris. I flew back to tell you myself. This is the BBC Home Service. We regret to announce... that the broadcast originally intended for this time... has been cancelled, owing to the tragic death... of our reporter, Mr. Mark Trevor. Mr. Trevor was one of a number killed in an air crash... at Le Bourget early this morning. No. It's a mistake. No, no, no! It's a mistake! A list of other victims of the crash will be broadcast later in the day. There will now be a short interlude. Carter, you've always told me: "Check and recheck a story. " I've checked and rechecked. The story's gone to press. - Well, how is she, Doctor? - Better, but not well. She's been here six weeks. Six weeks is a short time in this case. Grief does different things to different people. In Miss Scott's mind, she knows he's dead. But emotionally, to her, his death is like a bad dream... from which she'll awaken and find him again. However, there's a more immediate problem. - What's that? - She insists on leaving. I've prevailed on her to stay on here another week. But after that, there's nothing I can do to keep her here. Doctor, did she tell you what she'd like to do? No. Just that she wants to go back to work. - Can she travel alone? - Oh, yes, I think so. - All right. May I see her now? - Yes, of course. Come along. Hello, Sara. Hello. I understand you're ready to leave. - At the end of the week. - Good girl. - What's my next assignment, Carter? - Getting on a ship for home. I thought I'd stay in London for a while. Not a chance. We need you back in New York. I'd take you with me, but I have to leave tonight. There's a ship going from Plymouth on Saturday. - I'll have Jake put you on it. - Plymouth? That's right. The sea air will do you good. You'll have nothing to do on board but eat, sleep, and get completely rested. Sara, I know how tough it's been on you, but that's all finished now. - Do you understand that? - Yes. Mark is dead. When somebody dies, you have to pick yourself up and get going again, fast. I know. Because if you don't, you can make a lot of trouble for yourself. - What do you say? - I'll do my best. And I'll give you all the help I can. I love you, Sara. I'll be waiting for you. Is it a deal? Saturday, from Plymouth? It's a deal. Take care of yourself. I'll see you in New York. Hi. - Ready to go? - All packed. I got you a nice slow ship with a nice big bar. I'll need it. I wish I could offer you a drink now... Who taught you how to pack? You should always leave a bottle out. I can give you a cigarette, American. There's some coffee. Relax. I'm fine. Look, you're not sailing until tomorrow, so we can spend the evening together... and I'll tell you all about how I used to beat up my dad when I was a kid. Sorry, Jake. But I'm leaving today. I don't want to face the crowd on the boat train... so I'll sleep in Plymouth tonight and go aboard early in the morning. I'm supposed to keep you in chains till they ship anchor. Well, I'm as good as gone. From now on, I'll take care of myself. Okay. I'm flying out myself tomorrow for a briefing in New York. Next stop: Japan. - So, goodbye. - So, goodbye. And thanks. Cor! I waited for hours in the queue for these tickets, Miss Scott. You know, Mr. Klein, it was just like old times... seeing all them people buying tickets for the seaside. Me and my husband used to spend our holidays in Cornwall. - Here they are, Miss Scott. - Thanks, Mrs. Bunker. There's some stuff in the fridge, if you'd like to take it home. Thanks, Miss Scott. So long, Jake. Cornwall. Seems I heard about that place somewhere before. Isn't that way down in the west of England? Mind your own business, huh? Wasn't there a guy we both knew that used to live down there? - So what? - So what are you trying to do? - I just want one look at his house. - Sure. That ticket to Cornwall is like buying a round trip to the hospital. When I found out how near Plymouth was to St. Giles... You thought you'd drop down there and get yourself into some real trouble. All right, Jake. Hang it up. Do me a favour, sweetie. Don't go. - Aren't you going to be late? - Look, Sara, please. I told you I just want to see the town he was born in. Just one look, Sara. Then get out of there. All the boarding houses is full up. Every train from London brings more of them. It's nice having the town full again. We'll get the boats out for the shark fishing. Remember that whopper we caught just before the war? - Good afternoon, madam. - Good afternoon. - Are you the manager? - Yes. What can I do for you? I'd like a room and bath for tonight. I'm sorry, ma'am. I'm afraid we're full up. - You haven't anything? - I'm very sorry. It's been so long since people could visit this part of the coast... - that we're completely booked. - I see. - Is there a train to Plymouth tonight? - Yes. There's the 8:57. I wonder, may I leave my bag and coat here? Why, certainly, madam. I'll put them in my office. How do I find the old part of town? Go out there, turn right, and straight up Tregenna Hill. Tregenna Hill. That's right. Cross the quay, then straight up the hill. - Thank you. I'll find it. - Thank you, madam. Hello. - Hello. - I've never seen you before. Are you a tourist? Yes, I guess I am. My mother says tourists grow in the summer. She's right. - You're an American, aren't you? - Yes. Brian, tea's ready. I hope he wasn't bothering you. Are you all right? Look, come inside and sit down for a minute. It's no trouble. Come and sit over here. Would you like a cup of tea? - Thank you. - Good. I've got the kettle on. Are you feeling any better? You looked so pale. I did a bit too much today. I was ill recently in London, and I'm still getting over it. My name's Kay Trevor. Mine's Sara Scott. - Is this your first visit to St. Giles? - Yes. What do you think of it? Or haven't you made up your mind yet? Well, I've only been here for about an hour. That means you've been right round the town and back again. Show me. The left one's not bad, but the right managed to escape. My father said there's a building in New York so high... they have lights on it to warn airplanes not to come too close. That's the Empire State Building. I should like to build something that high. Then I'd stand on the top of it... and put my head in the clouds that came by. Brian's inherited his father's imagination. You've finished your milk, darling. You can go and play. Are you staying in St. Giles, or are you just here for the day? No, I'm going back to Plymouth. I meant to stay tonight, but I can't get a room. That's a shame. I know some people who take in guests. I could give them a ring and ask them if they've got a room. Thank you, but it's probably better for me to be in Plymouth. - My ship for New York is in the morning. - Oh, I see. The manager at the hotel said that there was a train back about 8:30. What will you do in the meantime? I'll stay at the Inn. My suitcase is there. That's no fun! Why don't you stay here and relax... and have dinner with us? Thank you, but... Look, the restaurants are going to be just as full as the hotels. And I can get a lobster. Do you like lobster? Yes. I've got him to bed. I'm still bigger than he is. I hope he didn't bother you too much over dinner with all his questions. I enjoyed them. Good, because he asked if you'd go upstairs and say good night to him. - You've made quite a conquest. - Do you think so? He can't talk of anything else but getting me to pack his things... so that he can go back with you and climb the Empire State Building. - I couldn't refuse after that. - I'll take you up. Is New England the same as England? Is New England the same as England? Well, it's a little the same. Only it's awfully cold in winter, with snow that comes right up to your ears. To yours, or mine? Yours. And in the summer, the sky spreads out like a tall, blue sail. What did you do there? Well, when I was a little girl... I used to watch the men printing my father's newspaper. There was the smell of ink, and the whirring of the machines. What does "whirring" mean? That's the sound the machines make. If I went to America, who would I play with there? There are lots of boys and girls your age. Do you have any? No. Lights out, Brian. It's past your bedtime. - I'll sleep later in the morning. - No, you won't. Come on, now. Good night, darling. Say good night to Miss Scott. - Good night, Miss Scott. - Good night, Brian. Would you like a drink before you go? - Yes, thank you. - Come on down to the study. Is anything the matter? No, it's just that music. I'll turn it off. Music has such a way of bringing back memories, hasn't it? Did it remind you of someone? You know, I think the most difficult thing about losing anyone... is to be taken off guard. The feeling of things half-said... half-finished... I can tell you something that helped me. I found it wasn't any good to resist grief. I just let it have its way... and after a while, something inside me said: "Very well, you can bear that. " It was easier then. How about that drink? For a while after my husband's death... I couldn't come in here without crying like a baby. Do you know a line from the Bible: "And the places that knew them shall know them no more"? Yes. I know it. My husband was with the BBC. Those are copies of his broadcasts. Perhaps you heard some of them when you were in London? Yes, I did. He did a series of on-the-spot recordings. The best he did was to describe how they took an unexploded bomb apart. I was so frightened just listening to it. How long were you in London? About three months. I work for an American newspaper. I've been here writing articles about the people in London. - Did you come straight from the States? - No. I was in France first. Paris. Mark and I were there a lot before the war. It's a lovely city. We nearly settled there for a while. Life has a strange way... of standing back until you're happiest... and then, when you've got a great big smile on your lips... it gives you a solid whack across the jaw. Do you know what I mean? I'm a newspaper woman. What life does to people is my business. I report it. Cheers. I'd better go. I don't want to miss the train to Plymouth. I'm afraid you're not going to make it. I didn't realise what the time was. Can't I take a taxi? Not at this hour. But my ship leaves early in the morning. Look, why don't you stay here tonight, catch the early train? - I couldn't. - But you'll get there in plenty of time. And I am sure that Brian has a lot of questions... he'd be delighted to ask you at breakfast. Come on, I'll show you the room. - Well, good night, Mr. Polworth. - Good night, Sam. Miss Scott? Ship Inn. Good morning, this is Mrs. Trevor speaking. Could you help me? Yes, Mrs. Trevor? Did a Miss Sara Scott check in with you last night? No, nobody's checked in, Mrs. Trevor. We've been full up for days. I see. Thank you. - Number, please. - Hello. Four-seven, please. Hello. Alan, it's Kay here. Hello! Listen, something rather odd's happened. Could you come round? - It's nothing serious, is it? - I'm not sure. I'll come right away. So I asked her to stay the night. When do you think she left the house? I don't know. Her bed's not slept in. I'm really worried, Alan. She seems so strange. Her nerves are raw. She looks like I looked after Mark's death. What's her name? Scott. Sara Scott. Well, I'm... I'm sure everything's all right. It was the way she looked at things. As if she were seeing everything for the last time. I'll go down to the police station. I'll call the doctor. Hello? Eight-five, please. Hello, Dr. Meade? This is Mrs. Trevor speaking. Yes. I wonder if you could possibly come over to the house. There's been a bit of an accident. Thank you so much. Goodbye. Dr. Meade says in a few days you'll be as right as rain. Is that a diagnosis or a weather report? He's really very efficient, although he does bumble about a bit. He's written to your doctor in London and given him a full report. I don't remember telling him who my doctor was. Dr. Aldridge. You told him on the first day. Are you warm enough? Yes, fine, thanks. You know, I'm going to miss you when you leave. During the war, Brian and I were here alone... but we were always expecting Mark, and that helped to fill in the days. And now I've filled your days with extra work. I didn't mind that. When Mark was here... I used to think St. Giles was the most perfect place in the world. Odd, isn't it, how the presence of someone you love... - can make a whole place beautiful? - Yes, I know. It's done me good to have someone here to look after. I felt useful again. And Brian's had a holiday away from too much attention. He wants you to stay on. Why don't you stay? I'd like to, but all of my things are on the way to New York. At least they made the ship. Besides, when the office finds out I'm not on board, they'll really be after me. You've got your job. My job's got me. Yes, I see. Well, first, you can buy anything you need in the shops here. And second, you can write to New York... and tell them that you're covering the most tremendous story... and you can't leave until you've finished it. And what do I hand in when I get back? I'll let you figure that one out while I get some paper. - How are you feeling, Miss Scott? - Fine, thank you. - Good. - I've spilt the glue! - On what? - On me! Excuse me while I unstick him. I wanted to come and see you before this. But then I thought, perhaps it wasn't very wise. I know what a shock it was when you saw me here. Yes, I thought... That I died with Mark? Almost. I was in hospital for a month. On the plane... did Mark say anything? - About you? - Yes. I don't remember. Or you don't want to remember. Does it matter? Kay tells me she's asked you to stay on for a while. Yes, she did. You told her you couldn't. Look, if you think you can travel... I haven't enough petrol to get you to London... but I can manage Torquay. There are some good hotels there. And while you're there, you can arrange a passage home. How would I explain that to Kay? I'll do the explaining. Why do you think you have the right to interfere now? I'm only trying to prevent Kay from being hurt. I'm not going to hurt her. If you stay here, sooner or later she'll find out who you are. And not from me. And not from me. If you don't feel up to it... I'll contact your office to book your passage for you. You're very kind. Don't mention it. But I think I can handle this myself. Let me know what you decide. Alan. Tell me. What did Mark say? Nothing. Stick the pin around the strut. Not in my finger! - You said you'd take me sailing. - Name the day. Today. Okay, today. I'll get my boots. What are you doing this evening, Kay? I think I'll stay at home. Isn't Sara well enough to stay by herself? No, not really. Let me pick you up at 7:00. We'll go to the pictures. Another time, Alan. Please. I'm ready! Good boy. Well, I'll call you tomorrow. Come on. Yes? Mr. Reynolds, I have your call to London, sir. Dr. Aldridge? Yes, this is Dr. Aldridge. This is Carter Reynolds. I got your cable. I'm afraid I've got some rather disconcerting news about Miss Scott. I don't understand. She's on her way to New York. No. It seems she went to a village called... St. Giles, in Cornwall. Well? Well, the point is, St. Giles is where Mark Trevor lived. She's actually staying in his house. What? I received a letter from a Dr. Meade, who attended her. He said she suffered some kind of shock and is remaining to recuperate. We've got to get her out of there. I'm afraid I really have no right to interfere. I simply felt it was my duty to get in touch with a responsible person. Of course, I agree. She should leave there as soon as possible. All right, Doctor. Thanks. - You'd better think fast. - About what? - Sara's still in England. - She can't be. She's living in Trevor's place. Did you know she was going there? She said she was just going to take a look at it. How could I know she was figuring on moving in? - Get me air reservations, please. - Yes, sir. - I think I'll hang myself. - Let me know when, so I can watch. What do you think she's doing? What does any woman want to do when a man dies? - Yeah? What? - Put flowers on his grave. As far as the eye could see... smoke and flame reached for the jet-black sky. And in the light thrown by this angry fire... the young face of the dead copilot could be seen... his eyes still open, as though even in death he could watch for the enemy. Flight Lt. William Briggs, the pilot who had spent so many summer holidays... in the countryside he had just smashed to pieces with his bombs... stared silently ahead as he turned the plane back for England. I hope you don't mind. Of course not. That's one of the broadcasts I heard when I was in London. It was almost the last. How many did he do altogether? One a week from the time the first bombers came over. The ones I heard were very good. I thought they were all good. He wanted to turn some of them into a book. Occasionally, he would come home and try and work on it... but he never had enough time. Have you ever thought of doing anything with them? Yes, I've thought about it... but I don't really know how to put them together. Did he leave any notes on how he wanted to do it? No. He threw everything away. I wonder if it would be a good idea... to use the scripts as part of a bigger story. How do you mean? Well... almost his own story. Tying one script to another... with descriptions of the man who wrote them... his life here at home... and then how different it became during the war. That's wonderful! But you'll have to help me with it. Brian was my guide through the days and years of Mark's life before we met. Through his eyes I saw the village of St. Giles as Mark had known it. I saw the people who lived there, the people he had grown up with... and I felt I knew them. Here was his boyhood school... where the man who had taught him was now teaching his son. It was becoming my village... my people... my life. What was it Mark had said? "All day long, you can hear the sound of the gulls... "and you set your watch by the coming and going of the tides. " Our time together was short and hurried... but now I was seeing his timeless world of ocean and sky. Even the joy of warm evenings in front of the cottage fire was mine. I've turned the clock backwards and fooled time. I'm putting together all the years I missed. They belong to me now. It's so vivid, Sara, and alive. I think I've done enough for today. Strange, you're even showing him in a light that I hadn't seen before. I've been trying to get every side of his character. You've done more than that. You see, his work in London... first of all took him away from me... and then his death seemed to make it final. But now you're bringing him back. I'll answer it. Hello. Good morning, young man. Is Mrs. Trevor in? She's gone shopping. But Miss Scott is here. Would you go and tell her there's someone to see her? Yes, sir. There's someone to see you. - She's coming. - Thank you. - Carter! - Hello, Sara. When did you... I just got off the train from London. You look fine, Sara. The air here must agree with you. I'm sorry. I should have wired you I was all right. I was planning to come over again anyway. I thought while I was here I'd pick you up and take you back with me. Now that you've lost your sense of direction... I don't want to let you out of my sight. Well, I can't leave just yet. Maybe in a few days. I understand this was Mark Trevor's house. Yes. His wife and son still live here, don't they? Carter, I didn't plan to stay. I only wanted to look at the village and the house, and then go. - That was some time ago. - Yes, I'm still here. So that's what he looked like, huh? I never met him in London. I didn't think I'd ever have the chance to see him, or his wife. I suppose it's foolish of me to ask if she knows who you are. - She doesn't know. - Sara, what are you doing? Waiting around for her to find out? - I said I was leaving soon. - What's holding you? I have something to finish. Carter, this is Kay Trevor. This is Carter Reynolds. - How do you do? - How do you do? Carter's my boss. He owns the paper I work on. I hope you're not going to take her away. We were just talking about it. We may have to close down if we don't get Sara's column going again. I'm sure that's true. She's a wonderful writer. One of the best. Have you told Mr. Reynolds about the work you've been doing here? No, I haven't had time. What work is that? Kay's husband was a broadcaster with the BBC. He was killed in an aeroplane accident just before the end of the war. I'm sorry to hear that. And I'm helping to make the broadcasts into a book. I see. Sara's spent hours gathering information about my husband's life. That's very interesting. I'd like to see what you've done. Well, it won't be finished for a few days. - I suppose you'll be going then. - Yes. I'm afraid she might even have to finish it in New York. I'm going to miss her. I'm sure you will. - Can you stay to dinner, Mr. Reynolds? - I'd be delighted. - Are you sure it won't be trouble? - Not at all. Didn't you say you had work to do this evening, Carter? Nothing important. I'll just send a few cables and come back. Good. Let's have a party. I'll get hold of Alan. And I must check the larder. - Carter, I want you to get out of here. - That's what I want to do. - As soon as you're ready, we'll go. - I can't leave yet. Why not? You can finish your work in New York. Kay asked me to help with the broadcasts. I'm doing it for her! - Sara, you can think faster than that. - It's true. You're just doing a job of work, eh? Nothing personal? All right, since we're pressed for time, I'll tell you what I'll do: I'll help you with them. I'm a pretty good writer. I don't need your help. Is it too private? Please, Carter, leave me alone. Sara, I didn't come 3,000 miles to say hello. I came to take you back with me. Say goodbye to Mrs. Trevor for me. I'll be back for dinner. What was your job during the war, Mr. Thompson? I was with the BBC. - Is that so? - Alan worked with my husband. - I see. - Outside broadcasting. I was Mark's assistant. Must have been very exciting work. It was, sometimes. Mrs. Trevor tells me that she and Sara... are turning some of her husband's broadcasts into a book. - That's right. - Are you helping them with it? No. I'd have thought Mr. Thompson might be helpful. He could give you valuable technical advice. I can still use it. I don't know that I could find the time. Don't you think the book's a good idea? Oh yes, fine. How long will you be in England, Mr. Reynolds? Only a short while this trip. I wish I could stay longer. I'd like to watch London recovering itself, starting to live again... without the blackout. They must have a wonderful sense of freedom there now. Did you spend time in London during the war? Hardly at all. I had to stay here in St. Giles to keep Brian away from the raids. There wasn't anyone to look after him but myself... so I was pretty well stuck here. I'm not sure that isn't the greatest cruelty of war: The separation of people, husbands and wives. Yes, the waiting for the mail to arrive each day. Most of the time waiting in fear. Did your husband manage to get home often? Quite often when he started his work, but not much the last months. Nobody had time then. I suppose not. They were hectic days for everyone. Yes, I know. I don't think I've ever felt... as lonely as I felt then. When Mark first began on his broadcasts... his letters used to be full of excitement. Everything he saw stimulated him... and he would write to me so that I would feel part of it. And then towards the end, the letters got less frequent. Just short notes. I think he was under some terrible strain. Yes. We all were. Did you say there was some brandy? Yes. I forgot about it. - Come and help me with the glasses. - Right. What are you trying to do, Carter? If you don't know, Sara, I didn't succeed. You think I don't feel guilty enough, is that it? Because Mark was with me during those days, that I kept him away from her? I want you to stop trying to take him away from her again. - I'm not trying to... - Sara, can't you see it? I'd like to propose a toast. - Mr. Reynolds. - Thank you. To Sara. - Landlord. - Sir? - Do you have some telegraph blanks? - I'm sure we have some somewhere. - Mr. Reynolds? - Hello, there. Sit down. - Thanks. - Have a drink? - Here you are, Mr. Reynolds. - Thank you. - What will you have? - I'll have a beer, please. - Make it two. - Two beers, sir. Certainly. What's on you mind? If you've got a minute, I'd like to talk to you about last night. What's bothering you, Mr. Thompson? Sara. Why did you let her come down here? Let her come? I instructed one of my employees... to put her on a ship for New York. Maybe he didn't understand, because she missed it. - She won't miss the next one. - Can I count on that? I'm going to put her on it myself. - Two beers, gentlemen. - Thank you. - Thank you. - Cheers. Exactly what's your concern in all this? - Kay Trevor. - Yes, I thought so. I don't like standing around while everything's shaping up to hurt her. A few more evenings like last night... All right, let's get to the point. What about it? While Mark and Sara were together in London... his letters to Kay got shorter and shorter. So she said. She sensed that something pretty deep was wrong... but before she could get at the truth, he died. Of course, she took it very hard... but she managed to get to her feet and start living again. She didn't let herself think about the last days. Only about the good times, when they were together. - Well? - Now Sara is stirring it all up again. - You mean the writing she's been doing. - Writing? That's grave-digging. And you're afraid Kay's getting too close to the truth? You've got to get Sara out of here. Look Mr. Thompson, you're worried about Kay finding out who Sara is... because you don't want her to get hurt. Well, I'm here to tell you it wouldn't do Sara any good, either. She isn't staying in that house for the view, or to hurt Kay. If she knew what she was doing, she'd be out of there like a shot. Mr. Thompson, we're in the same shoes... and neither one of us knows which way to walk. There's a dead guy called Mark Trevor holding on to two women. That's a tough rope to cut. I'm trying to figure it out. If you come up with anything bright, let me know... because I haven't got much time. Give me your coat. I'll hang it up to dry. I'm drenched. I've often wondered how you manage to keep this place so neat. I have a woman come in daily to throw my things around. Make yourself at home. Did you enjoy the picture? Oh yes, I love films that end with the dying criminal slowly climbing up... the church steps. Riddled with holes, like a Swiss cheese. This'll be warm in a minute. It was a lovely evening, Alan. Thank you. It was good to see you laughing again. Can I get you anything? A drink? Not for me. It's funny being in this room again. I remember when Mark and I used to come here... and the three of us used to argue and laugh. Yes, they were nice evenings. Alan, why do you do that? What do you mean? Turn away as soon as I mention Mark's name. I'm sorry. I didn't know I was doing that. You know, I've been thinking so much about the last weeks... when Mark wrote those short, restless letters. Alan, you were his friend. Don't keep anything from me, now. What happened to him? I don't know. But you were always with him. He was working very hard, day and night. He never had a moment to himself. You don't sound very convincing. Tell me the truth, please. I've told you. No. You've avoided it. Why? - What are you hiding? - There's nothing to hide. Was there someone else? Don't be silly. I want to know! Was that it? Kay, please. Did he fall in love with someone else? Listen to me, Kay. Mark loved you. Don't start torturing yourself. No! Mummy! Brian! Brian, what is it? Tell me what it is. I was dreaming. Oh, don't cry. Tell me what you were dreaming about. I saw Daddy, and there was a light in his study, and he was there. Well, that's nothing to be afraid of, dear. I wanted him to talk to me, but he wouldn't. Don't. Now, you lie down, Brian, and try to go to sleep. There. But if he really isn't gone away, why wouldn't he talk to me? What do you mean, darling? Mummy always talks about him, and you always talk about him. He is coming back, isn't he? No, Brian, he's not coming back. Now, I'll tuck you in and you'll fall asleep right away. That's a good boy. Where's Mummy? She'll be back soon. She went to the pictures. You're all right now, aren't you? I don't know. Well, of course you are. And you won't have any more dreams like that. I promise. - Good night. - Good night. Well, sir, you might try shark fishing for your amusement. I'm afraid that'd be more for the shark's amusement. Excuse me. Ship Inn. Yes, certainly. Will you hold the line? Mr. Reynolds? - Phone. - Thank you. Hello? - Carter? - Sara? Yes. I want you to come up and get me out of here. What's happened? I can't tell you now. Please hurry. I'm on my way. Kay? It started to rain. We went to Alan's place to wait until it stopped. What's wrong, Kay? Can you tell me? I found out why Mark stopped writing. He met someone in London and fell in love with her. It was really very obvious. Alan didn't say anything, but I could see it in his eyes. Alan didn't say anything, but I could see it in his eyes. I can't think of anything except, "What was she like? "Did she work with him? Was she beautiful?" Kay, listen to me. I can't help it, I've got to know! I won't see anyone. What's the matter? - She found out. - What? No, not about me, just that there was someone. Carter, I have to tell her. - Stay away from her. Don't do it. - But I must! - Get hold of yourself. Let's get away. - No. Do you want to stay and watch her suffer? - I'm going to tell her who I am. - What good would it do? If I hadn't come here, none of this would have happened. I brought him back to her. All right, she found out, but why tell her it was you? What could be more cruel? To let her torture herself about who it was. To go on wondering, not knowing. - Lf you tell her, she'll flay you alive. - I know. Well? I'll tell her. Want me around when you do it? But I want you waiting when I come out. With a big net? The biggest. - Good night, Mr. Polworth. - Good night, Sam. Sara. I'm sorry if I embarrassed you. You didn't. I felt frightened. I know. Kay, remember the first night I stayed here? You told me about Mark's death... and how you'd found a way to face it. Yes, I remember. You told me because you felt I was suffering the same way. You were right. I was. Mark and I met three months ago in London. Mark and you met? We fell in love. Why are you telling me this? I want you to know who it was. What are you doing here? Why did you come to my house? Kay, I knew so little about him. I had to see where he lived, just once, before I left England. I asked you what you're doing in my house. I didn't mean to come inside, believe me. I walked through the village and passed the house. Then I saw Brian... and when he talked to me, I couldn't seem to move away. Then you asked me in. I couldn't help it. Don't you understand? Oh, yes, I understand. I understand a lot of things now. Why you wanted to be friends... why you helped with the broadcasts, and why you stayed in the house. Kay, please. What are you trying to do? Take Mark away from me... even after his death? Say anything you want. I'm sorry, Sara. I didn't give you enough assistance. No one could expect you to write properly about him... without knowing all the intimate details. I'll try and make that up to you now. We were married in that village. The reception was in this room. We spent our wedding night in this house. Do you want to know what he said to me that night... and all the other nights we were together? And when Brian was born. Shall I tell you about that... or did you find out about it in London? I didn't know Mark was married until the day before he died. Of course not. And I was the one who invited you into this house. You didn't want to come in. And Mark's picture got smashed by accident. You brushed up against it, you weren't holding it. I've heard about as much as I can stand. I don't want any more lies. I want you to go. Not before I tell you this: I loved Mark with all the love I had. He was coming back to you and Brian. I was just someone he had met and was going to leave. He wanted to be here with everything he loved, the way I loved him. Please go. I'll get my things. We'll have a few minutes wait, sir. I'll find an empty compartment for you. Thank you. We'll spend a few days in New York, then fly to San Francisco. I want you to see how the conferences are working. And after that? The East. The finish is coming there soon, and I want you to cover it. Do you feel up to it? Lt'll be good to be working again. Would you come this way, sir? Sara! Wait inside for me, Carter. - Sara. - What is it? I wanted to say goodbye. Goodbye, Kay. Send Brian a photograph of the Empire State Building. I will. Goodbye.
