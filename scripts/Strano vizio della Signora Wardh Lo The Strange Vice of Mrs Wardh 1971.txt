How's it going Neil? Now that you live in New York, you've forgotten your old friends Obviously I'd like to come home more often. Isn't it true, Julie? Yes, especially if Wall Street was here But I don't have time to play tourist Talking of which, the meeting with Muller is set for eight. Seems he's willing to buy those share you told me about yesterday on the 'phone I'm sorry dear, but I don't have time to take you home it's very important you know. I'll call you a taxi. Don't worry, I can get one myself. We apologise if we steal your husband just a few metres into Austria. I'm not an annoying wife. The extremely important things first. What's going on? Good evening. Papers please. Here Excuse me madam, it is just a formality But why? A woman was killed half an hour ago, near the airport. Another woman killed? Yes, and cut with a razor again. You can go, good night. This story is becoming an obsession it is everywhere in the papers and on TV about that crazy maniac. Yes, they mentioned it in the US as well They should bring back death penalty, that's what they should do! Then those sick people would get the end they deserve. Keep the change. Welcome back, Mrs Wardh! Antonio, it's you. A pleasure to see you again, Madam Everything's in order in the apartment. Has anyone come in in the last minutes? No, madam, were you expecting someone? The maid comes tomorrow. I'll take care of the bags. Don't you worry Thank you - Mrs Wardh? - Yes? These are for you The porter also told me to deliver your suitcases Leave them here. - Thank you - you're welcome "THE WORST PART OF YOU, IS THE BEST THING YOU HAVE AND IT WILL ALWAYS BE MINE". JEAN Yes I understand, Neil. At least try to pick me up not too late though. No! I'm not angry even if Carroll calls me 'the Widow Wardh'. You've only stayed with me one night in the three days we've been here. Don't be too late. Bye. Julie, finally you've stopped bothering the old man. Look what I've brought you He's just arrived, fresh from Australia. With fantastic news! You wouldn't believe it. George! Tell her about our uncle. To be honest, I was fond of old uncle. Of course you were! Anyway, our uncle croaked and left a nice nest-egg for me and him. We're the sole heirs. You're family? Yes. At least that's the way it is for the notary in Sydney. Uncle's dead without a will and the young lady and I are the sole heirs. What should I say? Condolences or congratulations? Just say: Pleased to meet you. Pleased to meet you. Very good. Shall we drink something to celebrate? - Our meeting? - No, to uncle's death. Without which I'd never have met you. Oh, right. Julie, please don't steal the most handsome cousin I have, alright? A Martini rosso for me. - Are your clothes really made of paper? - Underneath as well? They're real, how naive. - What would you say about having a look? - Lets give them a tug. It's true, they're made of paper. Carroll! Why didn't you say Jean was here as well? He really pestered me about when you'd be back. I told him to leave you alone but he came anyway. Why does it matter to you? - I'm going. - Why, Julie? - Because I am. - Julie! Wait. - Leave me alone. - I'll take you home in my car. No, go away. Why? Nothing brings us closer than having a vice in common. I'm out of it, and now you make me sick. Leave me alone! Julie! No, please. Let him go. You don't know Jean. He likes hurting people. What's up? A terrible nightmare but it's over so don't worry. Julie tell me the truth. What's wrong? Is it that man? - Bye. - Bye! Next time don't wear paper, come already naked. - Funny! Goodbye. ...Bye! Goodbye! Wait a minute! Give it to me. No parking zone, obstructing traffic. You'll pay now? No, for god's sake, we collect them. Thanks. Done! There are more than a thousand policemen in this town! I want all their autographs! It's not that easy, you know. You're completely mad! Why? Seem strange to you? I once went to bed with someone who collected ladies underwear. I realised he only wanted to be with me to steal my knickers. Hey! Give me the paper, will you? - Here. - Thank you Let me have a look. Another woman murdered. We should be grateful to this maniac for eliminating the competition. They always write the same stuff and I don't read it, but if I don't buy a paper I miss it. How I envy you, Carroll you're always so relaxed and cheerful. No Julie you just take the best wherever you find it. A little here, a little there and avoid thinking the worst. I married Neil to finish with Jean. Neil seemed so wise and calm. But now I'm not so sure. Neil's your husband, dear. You can't expect to have everything from one man. Carroll! Please... The fact that you put someone between you and Jean is already really important Yes I know, but maybe I need to escape from myself. Jean would never accept not seeing me again because he can't stand losing. Excuse me, madam. There's a gentleman waiting for you I put him in the living room. I don't want to see anyone. He asked for your husband. I told him he was out but he wanted to wait to speak to you. Come on! Who are you scared of? If it's Jean we'll throw him out. Come on, it'll be fun for me Hello. Look who it is, the handsome cousin. My husband's not at home. I'm sorry, Julie. But Carroll told me your husband is an expert in financial matters. I'd like to get his advice. Yes, I see. But I'm sorry, my husband's not here. I'm glad instead, because... to be honest it was just an excuse to see you again. One definitely can't deny your sincerity. We interrupted our celebratory drink the other night, and I didn't want to miss the chance to get to know you as well as I can. Listen, my handsome cousin. If you intend to woo her take my advice: Given the time I recommend continuing over a steak. Mr... Call me George. Don't worry you'll get a chance to speak to my husband alright? Yes but it's you who should be worrying. I like bothering women even when their husbands are around. Shall we go, Julie? In any case thanks for the lunch invitation, beautiful cousin. For goodness sake, I'd never invite anyone to Birri's. They serve mustard which swells your tongue. Why did you treat him like that? Because I wanted to! People who are too sure of themselves get on my nerves. If I were you, I'd do it cousin or not. Lets go and eat. I am truly sorry, Miss Baxter. I had three tables left but a gentleman has just booked them. So we'll have to starve. Why? The mustard's excellent here doesn't burn the tongue at all. Want some? What a shame it's full. But it isn't, I've booked three tables. We can choose: Here, here, or down there. - Did I do wrong? - If it's that important to you. Yes, it is. I was worried I'd have to give up my mustard. Well, cancel the other two tables. - Here alright? - No, the other one's better. The usual for me. What Carroll's having is fine for me. So, that's three of what Carroll's having. Here we are! This way, you might think of me when eating an apple. The forbidden fruit. - For you I' II do... ...Nothing at all! You've got it all wrong, dear. It's always been Eve who should offer the apple. Excuse me, Miss Baxter. You're wanted on the telephone. I'll be right back. Maybe Carroll's right. What's this? Does it mean you want to eat me? No, it means I've already eaten you. You'll discover I'm hard to digest. I'm sorry, but I've got to rush off. In any case you're happier alone with your apples. Oh, Carroll! I'll phone you. Bye! I can take you wherever you want. To a taxi, thank you. So you're used to having your own way, aren't you? You've finally got it. Where are we going?! It's a surprise. Take me home at once! Later, Julie, later! - I told you to take me... - Relax. I'm just going to make you feel ecstasy and fear! Take me home now! Ecstasy, fear and a pounding heart! I kept my promises, didn't I? I'll say you did! I think I should apologise. I had misjudged you. No, no! You were right about me. But it's hard to resist so much. Thanks anyway... it's been a nice afternoon. I really needed it. Bye! Hello? Julie? Would you be amazed if I told you I loved you? Oh please, George, don't be ridiculous. Some words aren't used any more. I thanked you for the nice afternoon and that's it. I couldn't possibly want anything else from you. Please leave me alone. George?! Don't be offended but I don't want to see you again because today... because I like you. You mustn't phone me again. Never again. Alright, Julie. I won't phone again if that's what you want. How did you get in?! By the door, it was open. Why are you... I wanted to tell you again, Julie: I really like you and I'm not used to hiding my intentions. George I beg you don't complicate my life. Don't you understand?! I'm not the woman you met today. I know nothing about you, nor do I want to. For me you're fine as you are. Come on, lets go into my place. No, not now. Let me go. If you want if you want. I'll take you home. What's wrong? I'm scared! Scared of what?! Take me away, George. - Where? - Wherever you want! It's not a palace, is it? But it's good enough for me. I practically only come here to sleep. They are for Mrs Wardh. Thank you. NOW I KNOW YOU ARE TRYING TO ESCAPE ME BUT YOUR VICE IS A LOCKED ROOM AND ONLY I HAVE THE KEY. Who's the admirer?! Anonymous. I'd like to think it was you, but... they don't deal in these items on the stock exchange, do they? Julie, what's the matter? Nothing You've been treating me as if I'd done something wrong. If you feel uncared for or you need something we should talk. No, I don't need anything. Hello? Mrs Julie Wardh? Yes. Who is it? I have had occasion to see that you are a delightful lover, with interesting perversions And I am sure that your honest husband doesn't suspect it Stop talking nonsense! Who are you? That's not important, whereas I think that you should know what I want, Mrs Wardh. I want twenty thousand schillings not to tell your husband about your affection for George Corot. It's Jean. It's you, I know it! It's Jean isn't it?! Mrs Wardh, I will expect you at sunset at the South entrance to Palmenhaus. Remember: Alone, and with twenty thousand schillings. But... I didn't know what to do. When I saw that black car I was scared it would be Jean, and that's why I went into George's. Naturally. You wanted to go to bed with him and your fear of Jean gave you the excuse. Please, Carroll. Well, maybe it was as you said. Anyway there's still the problem of the phone call. It was Jean? Who knows? Have you watched theTV? They talked about that maniac. The last of his victims was that stupid bitch who stripped at the party... Could it be Jean? He's got a black car too. Carroll please stop it. I was joking. He goes to prostitutes, and Jean doesn't. What was his voice like on the phone? Well... I've already told you. It was a disguised, unrecognisable voice. Which means if he'd spoken with his normal voice you'd have recognised him. It must be Jean. He's the type. I'm sorry but I don't see the problem. If you like George you can forget about both Jean and Neil. So what if Neil finds out? I think he's a modern intelligent man. Everything's simple for you. While I don't know what George is for me, or what I am for him. I wanted to call him this morning but I don't even have his number and I haven't heard from him. And I don't want Neil to find out this way. He really doesn't deserve it. Listen, dear, don't have too many scruples. If you want his number I'll give it to you. Neil's had you in his bed for a year. Don't you think that's enough to make up for the heartache? When you talk like that I want to slap you. But what do you expect? It's the way of the world. Don't take any notice. I keep them in the oven because I hate cold underwear. In any case you mustn't go to that appointment. Where did he say? At the Palmenhaus in Shembrun at sunset alone and with twenty thousand schillings. I'll go. You? No it could be dangerous. And I don't want you involved anymore. Don't worry I'll enjoy it. And you'll see it's definitely Jean and then I'll laugh in his face. And if it isn't Jean? If it's someone else? Who? Maybe the sadist in the papers? Then that means I'm in grave danger because I am a bit of a whore. You joke about everything. Had breakfast yet? Well come on then, there's a coffee place downstairs which will make you forget all about diets. Come on, and stop making that face! There's the start! The riders are already in fierce battle for the front ...and it's number 36 first, followed by number 122. ...at the third bend, the final battle is about to begin. We're closing! We're closing at sunset! We're closing! Excuse me I had an appointment at the South entrance to the Palmenhaus but I've lost my bearings. Over there but if you don't hurry you'll be locked inside. They're about to close the gates now, so be quick. - Thank you. - Good evening. Help! Help! No! No! What's going on?! - Who was screaming!? - There... Look over there! Can you tell us anything? No, I didn't see anything. I just heard that poor girl shouting. She had asked me where the Palmenhaus South entrance was. She said she had an appointment. I don't know anything else. These little animals are my only friends, inspector. Much less repugnant than certain people I know. Listen... it's been said that you've been Carroll Baxter's friend for a long time. It's very important for us to know everything there is to know about her and her friends. Please follow me to the police station I need to continue to interrogate you. Don't worry, I'm used to being around cages. So... shall we go? Lets go. Is all this really necessary? So, madam... is this the man you spoke to us about? Yes. Why do you think he's the killer we're looking for? You flatter me Julie. Do you really think I'm capable of cutting a lot of women's throats? Yes, you could be. And though it might seem silly, he has a black car like the one described in the papers. You're incredibly amusing. But it was you who sent me those notes. What notes? The lady and I were joined in an "intimate" friendship. That's why I sent her flowers along with my thoughts, hoping she'd remember the good times, and perhaps decide on a nostalgic encounter. I hate you. The only thing I can't stand is indifference. Hate is a good feeling, it's fiery and violent like love, only more so. Mrs Wardh, you received a threatening phone call and that Carroll went to the appointment in your place thinking that you were dealing with your friend... Was it that man's voice on the phone? It was disguised, it could have been anyone. But Carroll told me it must have been Jean. A stranger wouldn't have had to mask the voice. Yes... but he was in a bowling alley on the other side of town while someone was cutting your friend's throat. That's the way it is, I'm afraid. Listen... why don't you check Mrs Wardh's alibi? You're a dirty coward. You see, Mrs Wardh doesn't have a black car, but she's always had a weakness for blood. Nobody's said the murderer you're looking for is a man. You're a... ...person you were keen on for over two years. That's enough! I'm not interested in your theories. That's fine. Can I go? - I've got something to do. - Of course. You can both go. Bring the other one in. What's his name? George Corot. They called you as well? Now I understand why my roses no longer affect you. George Corot! I've got to see you. See you at my place at five. - Julie, at last! - I'm really tired Neil... Let me speak to your husband now then we'll go away. Away from this city, from everything. No, George, not now. Maybe when they've found Carroll's murderer. It was foolish to meet today. I could be watched. You've told me there's already someone who knows... but do you realise that it should have been you instead of Carroll? So what? One can't hide forever. Does living mean so little to you? I don't know, George. If you weren't around I'd almost be happy to end it all. Please, someone could see us. I'll take you home. I'd rather you didn't. I'll call you tomorrow. Neil! Neil! Julie! The elevator was always busy so I had to take the stairs. Good evening. Good evening. Julie... Where have you been? What happened? There was someone in the garage who attacked me with a razor Was it Jean? Did you see him? Was it him? I don't know. He was dressed in black, it was dark... I don't know! Don't be influenced by the stories in the papers. Besides, we'll soon know if it was Jean. Neil! What do you want to do? Lets call the police. Where does he live? There's only one thing to do with people like that. You mustn't take any risks for me. You're my wife now, and that's all that matters. Tell me where he is. I'll go with you. Alright, come with me. Wait for me here. Neil! I told you to stay in the car! No, I'm coming with you. There's no light. Nobody's there lets go. There's a camera on the ground over there... A photo's been taken. Julie! Julie, calm down Julie! Neil Neil! Jean's car has gone! ADAM AND EVE LOST PARADISE BECAUSE THEY WANTED TO KNOW TOO MUCH Julie, wake up Julie! I've developed that photo. Look! Do you recognise him? It's the man in the garage. - Yes, it's him! - Who is he? Don't know. He was dressed like that, with those glasses. Now we know it wasn't Jean. Which means... he could be the murderer of the women and Carroll? I mean I suspected Jean because he was your lover. Obviously there's someone else. Oh, Neil! Where are you going? - I'm scared. - I'm going to the police. This photo could be useful to the inspector. - Hello? - George, is that you? Why did you take so long to call me? I'll tell you when I see you. Come and get me, I can't carry on. Come and get me, and we'll leave. We'll go to some quiet place as far away as possible. Anywhere. Okay. Give me time to pack a case and I'll be with you. I'll take you to Spain. I know a little place that'll make you forget everything. FOR NEIL When did she leave? Just before noon. Bye, dear. I'll call you when I get back from Sydney. Okay. Bye! Hello? Hi, how are you? No, I'm sorry. I'm leaving tomorrow. I'll be back in a week. Then I'll get the A122 toTokyo. No. I'm not tired. You don't sleep with the time zone changes. The light's gone out... it'll come back on. Alright! Yes, I'll bring you a souvenir. Will a kangaroo do? Why, what do you want? I promise we'll meet again when I get back. Bye! No, no! Help! Help! Has something happened? No, no. Nothing. Why did you run away? I wanted to get some sun. Carry on going after your prey if you want. I've seen one who's more attractive. VIENNESE HOMICIDAL MANIAC DEAD - George! - Yes? Look, they've found the maniac. He's been killed by the girl he'd attacked So it's all over, for good. Lets think about us. I'm hungry. I'll go on to the villa to prepare some food while you go and change some money. We've almost run out. You take my car and I'll get a taxi. - Bye! - Bye. - Take them. - Thanks. These are for you. - For me?! - Yes, that gentleman gave them to me... He was there just now. He must have left. SINCE THE LIVING DON' SEND FLOWERS TO THE DEAD THE DEAD GIVE THEM TO THE LIVING George. George. What's going on? What's wrong? Do you feel sick, madam? - No, no! - Madam... Julie! Julie. Julie answer me. It's George. Julie, what happened? Julie! - Excuse me, miss. - Yes? - Where can I find a doctor? - Down there, at the pharmacy. Thanks. This will make her sleep for a few hours. What's wrong with her? She's in shock, it's a powerful emotion. When I left her down in the village she was fine. Well, something must have happened maybe she got a fright. Know what you can do? I'll give you a number! Here it is. Doctor Arbe. He's my friend, a good neurologist. Ring him up. Barcelona's not far- by car you'd be there in half an hour. Thank you. Can I leave her here while I go down into the village to call? Don't worry. She'll sleep peacefully until this evening. - I'll show you out - Not necessary. I know the way. No, it's impossible. I've still got two appointments and I don't have a car. I can come tomorrow. Please, doctor. I'll pick you up. Alright, in an hour. Thank you, doctor, thank you. - How much? - 80 pesetas. George... George! George! So I brought her here hoping she'd feel better far away from it all. Then... I don't know what happened today. You mentioned blood earlier. She didn't say anything to me but I understood something straight away. She was with that man I told you about, for a while. He dominated her. Blood definitely has a strange effect on her. It both attracts and repels her. Listen it would be better not to tell her I'm a doctor. It'll be easier. Julie! It smells of gas! Quick, in the kitchen! The door's locked. Help me! Julie... Turn the gas off and try not to breathe! Open the window! Lets take her over there. No pulse any more. Go call, quickly, get them to send an equipped ambulance. - Is there any hope? - I told you to go and call the hospital. Get on with it! Inspector Doctor Arbe is here Very well, you can go. Mr Wardh, this is Doctor Arbe. He did everything to try and save your wife but it was already too late. And I'm telling you it isn't suicide. My wife was scared of dying. The room was locked and sealed from the inside! It wouldn't have happened if she'd been with me. Anyway, this man's guilty. I want to go now. Of course, Mr Wardh. The funeral? The body needs to be available to the authorities for a few days then you can send someone to collect it. George! You're late. The money, now! It's too hot for me here. A plane is leaving for Rio! I don't want to miss it. What are you scared of? Nobody's expecting you to be in Vienna, and nobody saw you here. Should the police discover that the maniac didn't kill Carroll your alibi would still be valid. Like yours, and you're the only one with a motive. Even if some cop unveils our tricks... you're out of it. Your passport says you're called John McDonald, you are Canadian, and Julie never met you. But you've got a cast iron alibi too. If they don't get me you're fine. They won't get you. Julie Wardh committed suicide. The money, now! Okay. Now you really are dead. A first-rate suicide for love. Have they paid up? Not yet. They want the death certificate, it's a matter of days. I spoke to New York. Hope I can manage to keep the creditors sweet and avoid bankruptcy. And you? No problems. Carroll's death means I'm the sole heir. We've got to be careful. If someone sees us together... Why? We're husband and lover united in memories. There's no risk. And there never was. I told you, didn't I? The best time to eliminate someone is when the police are hunting a homicidal maniac. We can help each other. You eliminate the cousin and I eliminate the wife. They're blaming it all on him... even though that idiot was caught before we finished the job. The suicide idea worked perfectly. Talking of which, our black suits? I burned them, they are completely destroyed. There's no evidence any more. Maybe it would be better to throw these gloves out. I burnt mine. Why? They're almost new. Did you like my line at the police station? "Anyway, this man's guilty!" And how did poor old Jean take it? Like a kick in the guts! He was so stupid he still didn't believe he'd had it. And if the Spanish police find him? They'll have found the motive for Mr McDonald's suicide. It's crucial that the insurance doesn't suspect anything or they'll drag it out forever. What do you think they could suspect? Your wife dies well after she'd left you, and you were miles away. And it was a clear-cut case of suicide. Julie! That woman! It's her, I'm sure! What are you talking about? I only saw her briefly... it was her, Julie! If you're already hallucinating we'll end up badly. No, it was her I clearly saw her. Lets go back. You're crazy. There was just a resemblance. - No! - I've never heard of the dead hitch-hiking. Alright just a resemblance. So, why not? Let's go take a look. We are screwed! Careful! It's over, Julie. Call and get them to send a pickup truck and winch I would have never reopened this investigation if our pathologist hadn't noticed that Carroll Baxter had been killed in a different manner than the victims of the serial killer. And there would have been three more criminals at large. Understood? I'm sorry, but I had no other way to unmask them. In thinking you were dead they felt safe and they betrayed themselves. But most of the credit goes to Dr Arbe, who saved you. I'm leaving you in good hands. You saved my life but I feel dead all the same You'll be able to forget everything. Time is the best healer, Julie. Good luck! THE END Any resemblance to real events and/or to real persons, living or dead, is purely coincidental
