That girl, she's growing like a boy... Hello? Hold on. Boss! A call for you. Hello. Yes... okay, thanks. So the kid had been drinking with his friends before he rode out on your bike. There was a truck waiting for the lights to change, and the kid smashed right into the truck. He died on impact. We were investigating the scene, and we found out that the bike belonged to you and that's how we came to contact you. How old was the kid that died? First year in high school. Even if the kid is guilty of stealing your bike, you are still accountable. Let's go easy and just settle for something. It's the same for the truck driver. He is a part of liability so he's in the same situation as you Mr. Kim. He needs to settle too.. His break light was broken. The kid died by bad luck. Poor kid! The parents knows that their kid was at fault, but what can you do? Its the law. What did the parents say? I haven't been able to talk about the settlement yet. First you should go to the kid's funeral and meet them. Gradually you can talk about the settlement sum. Reach to an agreement that will make them satisfied. Don't make it hard on yourself. I talked to them, and it turns out this is their only child. Is there anyone here? Hello? Is there anyone here? Hello? Is there anyone here? What are you doing still living in here? The building is going to be demolished in a couple of days. You really have to vacant your place. I am asking you same as your neighbours. Alright? Are you continuing to take your medication? You said you're working as a construction worker. How's that going? They say that construction companies are suffering due to bad economy these days.. Are they paying you properly? Are you meeting anyone? Do you meet up with friends or family? I dont tend to contact them often. Do you drink a lot and often after work? No. I don't really drink. What you do by yourself? Do you perhaps masturbate? Masturbation is not a bad thing. If you can't sleep, it relaxes you, helps you to breath deeply, sometimes.. What do you usually do when you get back home from work? I just eat, watch TV.... You've continued to take your medication. When you see a child, do you feel what you used to feel? You've gotten a lot better. Don't worry and keep taking your medicine. Ok, let's stop for today. I'll write you 2 weeks worth of medication. Do you want to tell me anything? No, nothing. If that's the case, I'll see you in two weeks. Last night in a parkin lot in Guri-shi, Gyong-gi province. A wild pig shot off like a bullet. The police car tried to catch it in quick pursuit but the wild boar managed to get away. What is that?

It's going to be hard. What did you do before? Oh, I just worked at a construction site. Wouldnt that be better? I think paycheck there must be higher than a taxi driver's. Yeah. but these days the construction companies are also in bad shape. Oh man! It doesn't matter what we guys do We're screwed.
