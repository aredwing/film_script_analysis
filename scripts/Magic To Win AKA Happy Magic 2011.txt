Even for a genius like Einstein, his brain was only 3-5% more active than others. So you can imagine if our brain is 100% active, how smart and powerful we will be!. But the world is full of extraordinary things. Someone might have already developed this potential and become a superhero!. So if you see someone doing something incredible, don't be scared. It's not witchcraft!. It's only a science-defying experience, a witness to a magical power that we all yearn for!. Magic To Win Macy Cheng. Macy Cheng. Macy Cheng!. Superman returns!. Good morning, Prof Kang. In that film, by flying around Earth in super speed, Superman spins Earth backwards and reverses time. If we are to formulate this concept, then Time is equivalent to Earth. Macy, you just returned to reality. What's the mass of Time?. Well, it depends on... how heavy your watch is. That's what you think. The correct answer is... Hey!. The game is about to start!. But he still has the volleyball. Let him keep it as a souvenir. That's the mass of Earth. That's also the mass of Time. If men are so powerful, can they reverse time?. According to the law of conservation, energy can be transferred or absorbed. So in theory, the answer is yes. But in reality... Catch it!. Men simply cannot withstand such power. How can they reverse time?. Stop daydreaming. Don't waste time!. Macy!. In order not to waste time, we better go now!. Hey!. What are you doing?. off to a game?. Yes!. Bye-bye!. Good luck!. Look, our opponents seem formidable!. We better watch out!. How you look is more important than you hit!. Formidable or not, we'll wait and see!. Look how fit our team is!. And look at them... What's our strategy today?. We'll take the offensive and spike the ball at them. Great?. Great!. They'll die. What's so funny?. Never mind. Coach Liu will deal with him!. By the way, what's taking Coach Liu so long?. oh yes!. Good morning!. Sorry!. In a hurry, Coach Liu?. We have a game. Come root for us if you're free!. How fast the elevator goes is not related to how fast you press the button. Is that so?. Pressing it too fast might short-circuit... ...the board. If you carry on, you may damage the elevator. What's going on?. We're stuck in the elevator!. Help!. You should have come earlier to root for your team. If they lose any more points, they're doomed. Really?. Let's just take this as a handicapped game. Winning...no, friendship is...more important. Macy...are you all right?. You're giving us so much face!. You used your face to hit the ball!. So thick-skinned!. Thick-skinned?. What's going on?. Where is Coach?. We have no idea. only 10% are due to mechanical malfunctions. This one belongs to the former, so we're safe.

You're too obsessed with my novels. I know you're a Wood magician. What?. Don't pretend!. You turn what you foresee into sci-fi novels. You knew I would come. Then why are you still asking?. Let me ask you something I don't know then. After amassing the magic of all 5 elements, is it true that you can return to the past?. If I haven't written it, that means I don't know. Wait for my next book. How can you not know?. I don't wanna know!. Since you don't know, then do as you've written. Lend me your Wood magic!. What for?. What a humiliating defeat!. our opponents were too strong today. There're 6 of us. We lost on average 4 points each. I must have lost the extra point. We should always look on the bright side!.
