And I think if you"d asked him, I think he would have said that we were friends. - What kind of friends?. - Good ones. I mean that. Now, he left you a $200,000 policy. Pardon?. Part of it"s from working at the plant, and an option that I put together for him just for you. And he"s paid up in the full. Frankly, there are some questions as to the manner in which he died. I don"t understand. Was he on any medication at all?. - I wasn"t his caretaker. - Uh-huh. Gosh, you know, he"s only retired 10 minutes. He had the RV parked in the driveway. He worked in a factory all his life. He wanted to go out to the coast and see the ocean. - Which one?. - Not sure. East, I think. I"ve always preferred the West. It"s a lot cleaner than the East. I think the only place dirtier than the East Coast is Mexico. We"re gonna have to send, uh, some lab tests up to Des Moines. What kind of tests?. Urine. Now, the only way that money becomes available... ...is if he was clean. What about my mom?. Oh, your mom"s a beneficiary if you"re not around. But he wanted you to have that. Does she know about it?. She called twice today. Listen, Irv. That money sure would come in handy. Save me a lot of trouble. Maybe Donna and I could split out of here, you know?. Start someplace else. I don"t like to talk about family in the office. Okay. - Hi. - Hi. I don"t know what it is with kids today, but I think too much money can go to their heads. We gonna say grace?. - Amen. - Amen. So... you talk to Esper?. Just yesterday. What"s the big dealio?. I don"t know. Nothing special. You have something you want to tell me?. Not that I can think of. I thought you wanted to tell me something. No. You"re not pregnant, are you?. Sorry Just... No, Daddy, I"m not. - Why would you say that?. - I don"t know. Somebody seems to think you"re gonna up and leave me. Pardon?. You know, it broke my heart when I heard him say it. I don"t know what I"m gonna do about that guy. You"ve been saying that for three years. When"s he gonna marry you?. I finished pressing your shirts before I came. Thanks, sweetie. Sweetie, when your mom moved on to another world, I was never quite the same again. Please... Don"t move too far away. Hi. What"s your name?. I already got an old man. But, uh, I guess I could tell you my name. - It"s Donna. - Donna?. - Donna. - Mm-hmm. Well, Donna. You want to go take a ride with a stranger?. My dad told me to be careful of boys that drive fast El Caminos and look like... Bruce Willis. Bruce Willis?. You ever heard of Bruce Willis committing any crimes, huh?. Hell, he"s a certified hero. I guess you"re right. I"ll take a ride with you, then. I never been in here. This was his place away from Mom. Better to get it over with. Something smells like cat piss. You think a stray kitten got in here?. - What?. - Put that cigarette out. What is it?. Crank. You think it"s the real McCoy?. Well, it ain"t fake. No wonder he kept this place locked. Esper, are you crazy?. Yeah. Bitter. It"s not that bad. You feel anything?. A little. Got to snort it. Should we?. Well, we"re free, white, and 21, ain"t we?. ...another nonstop half-hour. You think really clear right now?. Yeah. Like God is whispering in my ear. I love this gun. Can we drive to Egypt?. I wake up every day and wish we could. At least New York. That way we don"t have to cross an ocean. Too many of them terrorists. Princess?. Yeah?. Thanks. For what?. Not laughing at me no matter what I say. You are funny, though. I know. You love me a lot, huh?. I could watch paint dry if it was a picture of you. And the workers fell to their knees for they had witnessed a miracle right here in our own little town. That"s amazing. Marriage is this kind of miracle. There"s something about you, Donna. Hmm?. You haven"t been here a lot. No. But I"m not an antithesis. It"s atheist, honey. Sorry. I meant atheist. Have you even been baptized?. I don"t know. There"s a light around you. Not a raindrop in sight. Would you baptize me?. Do you accept God, Our Lord and Savior, as your salvation, and do you believe in miracles?. I do. And I believe in miracles. Then I baptize you, Donna Huffman, for you have accepted God. Don"t - Don"t you have to throw water on her?. Water is not necessary. How about you, son?. How could all that money rest on a person"s bladder?. Irv says it"s a part of the policy he made Dad sign. And why did that prick Leo leave all that money in your name and not mine, huh?. I was married to him for 20 years. I plan on covering all of Dad"s debt and then sharing it with you. Donna and I got engaged. You think you"re pimp rich now?. Did I say something wrong?. Eat your supper. You expecting someone?. Relax. I"ll get it. Evening, son. I"m with the Department of Corrections. I"m your dad"s probation officer. Probation officer?. For what?. Meth task force. You ain"t gonna bust anybody here. My dad"s dead. What the hell is that?. Is he dead?. I don"t think so. Hmph! You"re under arrest. Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law. I"ll be a son of a bitch. We don"t even have to do anything illegal here. Where you gonna take him?. To hell. It"s done. What"s that?. You know I don"t drink, lovergirl. Sorry. Get in me. In a minute. In a minute. Don"t you like what you see?. I want you to listen to me, okay?. I want you to wait at least a week or so until after Esper"s funeral before you start calling Irv about the policy. Do you understand me?. I"ll be fine. And I don"t want you getting all slut-headed on me when you see your son in a pine box. I"ll do anything you want. I love you so fucking much. Understandably so. Because... "Cause I... I caress... ...like an angel. Ah! And I fuck like the devil. Oh! Oh, yeah. Take me, Don Juan. - You like that, don"t you?. - Yeah! - LARRY: Is this Donna?. - DONNA: Yes, it is. Well, hi, Donna. Uh, this is Larry Clarkson. Who?. I"m with the Corrections Department in town. - Mm-hmm. - What do you want from me?. Well, I need you to come down to my office... ...to figure out what to do about your boyfriend. - Esper?. - Esper. Yes, that"s right. Is he all right?. Well, I arrested him just yesterday evening. - I haven"t seen him. - Uh-huh. Well, that would explain why you haven"t seen him. Well, I figure if you come down to my office, we can, uh, maybe figure out some way to bail him out. Okay. Uh, where you at?. I"m on Sixth Street. Okay. I"m on my way. I"ll see you then. Hello?. Can I help you?. Donna?. Is that you?. How did this happen?. You promise, cross your heart in front of God, you won"t say anything to anyone?. Cross my heart. Esper"s in jail, and I don"t know how to get him out. Who did this to you?. He told me he would put me in jail if I said something. He said he would help me get him out. Who, Donna?. I have to get Esper out of jail. I can"t ask my dad for bail money. It"s okay. We"re going to get him out. Were you raped, sweetheart?. Do you still see the light around me?. Nobody can take that away. The Lord blessed you with it. - Did they get you a doctor?. - Hell no. - It looks real bad. - It hurts. Did they take your dope?. Well, they"re police, Donna. - I want some dope. - Let"s get the fuck out of here. I- I really want to get some dope. I feel so alone without it. - You jonesing?. - Mm-hmm. Real bad. Can we get some, please?. Do I look like $200,000 to you?. You look like squatted shit to me. Now get in. Why do you have to be so mean?. - It didn"t happen. - He"s not dead?. Not only is he not dead, but Daisy put the money up to bail him out. That little bitch. Fuck! I already started grieving for my dead son. All right. Shit. Okay. Okay, here"s what"s gonna happen. I"m gonna monitor Esper till his official court date. I"m gonna have that little fucker back inside before the end of the month. How did you let this happen?.! I"m sorry, Larry. - What did you call me?. - Larry?. Oh, you mean "God," don"t you?. As in, "God, if I was I still wouldn"t be as smart as Larry!" Say it! God, if was 100 times as smart, I wouldn"t be as smart as Larry. Better. You know, you never would have been able to put any of this together if it wasn"t for me, you idiot. Wipe your lip. Okay, from now on, you"re gonna keep your stupid trap shut. [ Sighs ] You let me handle things. All right. Come here. Sorry. Thought you were the feds. Or aliens. I need some dope. Artie slings the dope. Where is he?. Crashed and burned. You may be family, but those are the rules. This is a business. Heard you lost your jail virginity. Who"s your probation guy?. Don"t have one yet. You will. Who"s yours?. Got Don Wheeler. Deals with the juveniles. Once I turn 18, I get turned over to the big fucker. Who"s the big fucker?. Dirty cop. Comes by here all the time and makes us give him a load. Then he comes back and tries to bust us six months later. Sounds like a fucker I know. Hey. What kind of book you got here?. Uncle Fester"s. Key to methamphetamine manufacturing. - This teach you how to batch?. - Sure does. Ecstasy, too. ESPER: What does it say?. Well... "Making Methamphetamine. " That"s it, baby. - That"s working?. - Yeah. Ah! It"s hot. - Put in two?. - Yep. Hey. Come here. I think I got it. - Want to try?. - [ Chuckling ] Yeah. Oh. Mmm. Tell you what. [ Inhales deeply ] God, it gives you a rush, doesn"t it?. Tell you what. I don"t give a shit. I"m never gonna work in a fucking factory again. They can kiss my ass. - Mm-hmm. - You know that?. We can take this, and we can make this stuff in 20 fucking minutes. Are you kidding me?. What"s the crime in that?. Is there one?. No. I don"t want to sell to no kids or nothing like that. Plus, it makes me feel good. Come here. Come here, beautiful. It"s pretty, huh?. Not as pretty as you. Come on. Let"s do some more. Set me up a line. ...where we once placed our heaviest reliance. Glen Hanson reports. This is America's great breadbasket - the Midwest. But we're alarmed out here - alarmed at the rate our farms and croplands are being abandoned. No one living in this fertile plain and watching these lands endlessly produce their bounty ever believed it could happen. - Where"s everybody going?.! - It's as simple as that. For 100 years, the great expanse of land from the Mississippi to the Rockies, from Texas to Montana, poured forth a superabundance of wheat, corn, and cattle to feed a nation and the world. It was an article of faith here that anything that increased the yield was good. And it wasn't a purely selfish point of view. ...and we took our responsibilities seriously. You didn"t get out of here, though. I know you love me, Larry. ...to see what was happening. Oh, we see it now, of course... I know you do. I know you do. I know. ...to kill the insects just as they were supposed to do. Dude, just keep it low. Here. Shit. I feel queer with you holding it. Relax, relax. Well, let me do it. Well, now... Hey, I"m sorry about Leo. Thanks. Mmm. Tried to call him from jail. Oh, your dad?. Then I realized he was dead. Huh. That"s weird, man. Yeah. Donna help you make this?. Sure did. How long did it take?. Not long. This chick can make any dope. Who is the chick?. She lives here in Polecat. She"s new in town "cause she strips up in Des Moines. Fuck her yet?. Not yet. Dominique knows how to batch. Dominique?. Yeah. Like dominatrix. Sex-goddess stuff. That"s good, but it ain"t any dope. She got a strike! One more! She got it. You want to bowl or what?. Let"s do it, man. Let"s bowl. Let"s go. We got to hurry. Get up there! Get up there! - I am. - Let"s go. Break it off. Farmer! Let"s go. Aah! Shit! - Go on, Nicky. Run! - MAN: Hey! - Come on! - Bastards! - Come on! - Damn it! I"m not into needles. Banging it"s a better high, man. Plus, it won"t mess your nose up. I got a hole in this nostril that would take a quarter of dope to pack to even get drainage. Smoking is shit. Ether makes me cough. Wrap that rubber around your arm and find me a vein. You got a boyfriend?. Let me put it to you this way. When I shoot, I want to screw. Even you. Good choice. Did it hurt?. It"s heaven. Want me set you up, baby?. I like to share. It"s the ritual that gets me off now. Ooh. Look at me. Do you like me?. Sharing the blood is caring. What"s wrong?. Did it feel bad?. Somebody"s trying to kill me. Please stop saying that. I never said it before. You mumbled it to me in a dream. The dream feel real?. Yeah. But it was more like a nightmare. I"m not working ever fucking again if we can manage to sell this shit. We can sell it. I just don"t know if it"s the right thing to do. What"s better than going in at 5:00 a. m. tomorrow morning to provide America with garbage bags?. I just want to do it right, you know?. I think I"m in love with Dominique. You out of your mind, man?. Bitch probably has AIDS. She knows how to move her body. You"re in love with any woman who sleeps with you. You use a rubber?. No. Nobody in Iowa has AIDS. How are you, Donna?. Fine, thank you. I take it you"re not even gonna look at the wrong side of the law, are you, now, boy?. Well! Look who we got here. You"re next. Look who"s in my fucking office - Esper Harte. I"m your new probation officer. I only got a few simple rules. You follow "em, we"ll get along just fine. Well, you were convicted on a narcotics-related crime. That means [chuckles] you can"t ingest any illegal substances. You with me?. Would you like a cigarette?. Why are you trying to kill me, man?. Come on, boy. One cigarette ain"t gonna kill you. Do you have X-ray vision?. Not at the moment. Then how"d you know I had dope on me that night?. Perceptive. You see, ice has been a family tradition around these parts since "93. The only good thing about that rat poison is the fat whores, they get skinnier. You ever given your urine away?. To the toilet. Hmm. Well, you"re in luck. "Cause we got a toilet just around the corner. You know, some dishonest people, they let their kids pee in the bucket, and then they turn that in. So now the state requires that I watch it come directly out of your penis. Showtime. Maybe you need a little mood music. Helps sometimes. Hey, hey! We have a winner. Did you know that your little girlfriend has the juiciest pussy?. She didn"t tell you that she came by - your little Daisy?. Donna. You"re full of malarkey. Me?. Oh, I"ll take that from you. Well, I"m gonna ship this off pronto, have the results back in a week. I sure hope you don"t drop dirty. - Good morning. - Good morning. I got to talk to you. Okay. I"m going nuts. I"m going nuts. About what?. With the probation man?. Okay, we got to get out of here. That guy"s gonna fucking kill me. We keep the same damn plan, okay?. We leave. Make money selling, and we leave. You with me?. Of course I"m with you. I love you. I love you, too. I love you. Touching me like that. You like it. I"m not gay. I saw you staring at me... at my tits. I do not stare at you. Lose the Barbie bull. They"re soft. Do you want to kiss them?. Not really. Okay. You"re a real slut, you know. I"m not a slut. I"m just open-minded. How many people have you had sex with?. I"ve lost count. But I"ve screwed blacks, women, Mexicans, faggots, even some animals. That"s animal abuse. I like women better than men. Who was the first person you slept with?. My uncle. He used to take his penis out and wave it at me when I was, like, 10. They all do. It"s the truth. If there"s one thing I don"t lie about, it"s my sexuality. I don"t lie about mine, either. How many guys you slept with?. One. That"s pathetic. You ever had a brown-eyed slammer?. A what?. Brown-eyed slammer. Up the butt. Yeah. All we got to do is what Donna"s doing there. Cope. We"ll put up a sign. Spread the word. You just turn your porch light on. Look, I got a guy in town. I"ll make a call and put the address out to the using public. We turn on that porch light out front before dark, and you"ll have people lined up down the street. Clean you out in 10 minutes. Need more cold pills. Fucking light doesn"t work. It needs - It needs a new light bulb. Look at my box, baby. I never wrote "fuck" on anything in my whole life, but I can"t get the "K" right "cause I"m out of nail polish. In Japan, F-U-C means penis of the dragon. Where are you from - Japan?. No. They invented crank. Not the liquid version. Kamikazes. Nazis. They perfected it. How"d you learn it so good?. My mama. I"ll buy you some paint, okay?. We don"t need you learning Japanese. Dominique, call that guy. Get some more beer, too! Hey, how you doing, Irv?. Uh, sorry to bother you. You got a second?. Thank you. How you doing?. Look at that. Huh. Is this your daughter?. My goodness. Isn"t she just a little peach?. Must be difficult being a single father and all. Yes, it is. Well, I"m here about Esper Harte. You see, I was Leo Harte"s probation officer. Sorry, I didn"t make the connection. Now I"m Esper"s. He was convicted on possession with the intent to distribute. Now, word has it he"s about to come into a whole lot of money. Well, that"s confidential. I"m not at liberty to talk about that. I totally understand. I was just, uh, you know, hoping maybe you could help me figure out why a kid who was coming into money would want to sell that rat poison. Well, you have a good evening. Sorry about your... interruption. You still alive?. Yep. I"ve been looking for you. I"ve been real busy. Doing what?. I haven"t seen you or Donna for over a week. Donna"s fine. You got a second to talk?. I"m kind of booked up right now. It"s about the settlement. Did you get the results back or what?. Yes, and they were positive. Does that mean good news or bad news?. His urine was dirty. He was high as a kite when he died. So, what happens to the money?. Well, there isn"t any. Nothing?. Zero. Esper, money isn"t God. It just wasn"t meant to be. Listen, Irv, I plan on marrying your daughter someday soon, so if there ever was a time for a guy like you to lose a little bit of paperwork, well, now would be the time. I"m looking forward to having grandchildren, Esper, but I define myself through my image in the community, and you obviously do not. Okay. I"m sorry. Esper, listen. Esper. I don"t want to be interfering with either of you, but have Donna call me. I will. I"ll see you, Irv. Try to take care of those hangovers. Hey, you. - Whoa. - What are you doing?. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! Relax. This is the guy I called. Where you been?. Give yourself a minute to adjust to our climate. Sorry about the weapon. We"ve been cooking for a couple weeks. Did you hear that?. No. They"ve been knocking on my door all night, man. He"s tweaked out, Joey. You think something"s going on out there?.! I thought a saw a cop-looking car scoping us out. Are you checking him out?. No. He"s ugly. Well, what if he wasn"t ugly?. I still wouldn"t like him. You think fucking he"s a cop?. He - He"s a deejay. His mouth moves, but then he doesn"t say anything. Not what I thought he was saying. - Go unload my gun. - Calm down. Look, can we set me up with a couple bags?. We cool?. I"ll take care of it, Nick. Ah ha ha ha. - Mmm. - Mmm. Motherfucker. Wait a minute. You just gonna have a go at her... like you"re gonna fuck her or something?.! What, she"s your girlfriend now?. I"m just protecting my friend. Nick, I think she can protect herself. Hold on. Just chill, boss. I"m just gonna take my... You son of a bitch! ...fucking 3 grams and go, okay?. Take your dope and get out. Yeah, sure, but, you know, somebody ought to keep that fucking freak on 74-hour insanity watch. You call the cops, and I come with this fucking freak - this freak - and we split your fucking head open, okay?. Okay! You fucking put the address out, or you leave the dope. Okay?. Get out. Okay! Hey, listen. I"m really worried. I need to know if you have seen my daughter or her - that fella - Esper. No. All right. I"m sorry. I"m just - I"m kind of nervous, that"s all. No, I know, I know. Look, if you do, please call me, okay, no matter what. I"m gonna hang up. Okay. Come on. Freak. Hey, okay. Come on. Okay. Come on. All right. Okay, come on. What"s your problem, huh?. I don"t have a problem. Huh?. See, I don"t have a problem. Why you acting so weird, huh?. - Come on. Stop it! - God! You know, you don"t want to do it. Either you"re on the rag or you don"t want to do it, you know?. You... You tell me every detail. You exclude not one thing. He called me down to his office, claiming you were in trouble. Would you like a cigarette?. It was evening when I got there, so nobody else was around. I treat everything... like I treat a pussy. He put a gun to my head and told me to take my clothes off. But I wouldn"t do it. So he handcuffed me to the wall. And he ripped my top and my panties off. And then he got it really hard, and he put it in my face. He told me to suck it, but I wouldn"t. And then he put the gun in my mouth. And then he put the gun inside me. He was so strong, I... I didn"t want to tell you. I figured... I figured... you"d think of me as a takeback or something. I love you too much not to kill him. I"m pregnant, too. Come here. Come here. Shh. Come here. Come on. It"s okay. It"s okay. He took something from you that wasn"t his to take, okay?. I want to kill him. I want to fucking kill him. Come here. ROD: Yes... LARRY: Well, hey, Rod. I need the urine analysis for Leo Harte. Yeah, that test is positive for methamphetamine. Excuse me?. - Okay, boy. - Hang up the goddamn phone. You are making a big mistake. Hang up the goddamn phone! Hang up the damn phone! ROD: Is everything - - Stand up. - What?. Stand up. Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay. Hey! Drop your pants. I want to see your penis. - What?. - Drop your goddamn pants! I want to see your penis! Okay, okay, okay, okay. This... is for branding my girl, you narco swine piece of shit. Aah! Shit. - Did you kill him?. - No. It wasn"t loaded. Can you believe that?. Take it! Get in the goddamn car and load the gun! - Okay. - Get in! Keep it loaded! Get in! You do whatever you got to do to sell the rest of the dope. Donna, Nick, and I are taking the money and going to Mexico. You ain"t welcome. We split it 50/50, and you get the fuck out of here. Shit. I"m gonna put in an order. I"m not hungry. Once we tell the waitress we want an orange soda and a piece of cherry pie, the slinging starts. I... Yeah, can I get a, uh, orange soda and a piece of cherry pie, please?. I"m gonna take a piss. Sharing the blood is caring. Oh, my God! I love you. I want you in my heart. Nick, it"s me - Donna! There"s bloody shit all over my toilet! Oh, my God! What are you doing?.! You killed the baby! You killed the baby! Oh, my God! You"re going crazy, Nick. You"re tweaked out. Oh, my God! Stop it! You killed the baby! There"s nothing there! - Baby! - Oh, my God, Nick! Stop it! You"re fucking crazy! Stop! There"s nothing there! Hey, man. You just order cherry pie and an orange soda?. Yeah, I guess so. Hey, man. You can"t be in here today with that bitch. Who?. The bitch you came in with. I had my burrito inside her, too. So don"t think you"re so hot shit to my face. Aah! Pedro! Fuck you! Clear the goddamn table. I"m gonna cut this guy. Don"t ever sell where Ramrod sells. Will you remember?. Dirty baby killer! I got it! It was a fucking miracle of God! You had a miracle of God! I"m gonna fucking burn you, Nick! You"re fucked! Don"t make me burn you! Don"t! Don"t make me burn you! Aah! Never say "fuck you" to me again. Ugh! Fuck you. Donna?. Bud?. Don"t - Get away. It"s me, okay?. Esper. You"re tweaking. Hey. You remember that time when we were chasing each other around the house when we were kids?. We came around that corner and ran smack-dab into each other, huh?. And my tooth got stuck in your forehead. I still got the scar. Give me the knife, Nick. This fucking gnome burned my dick off. Hey! It"s Donna, okay?. You got a knife to her throat. Come on. I"m sorry, man. I took too much. For what?. It"s my fault. I don"t think life likes me too much right now. Oh, no. Hey, Nicky. Life likes you fine. Do me a favor. Name it. When you join me in hell... ...bring my dick with you. No! Oh, no! Jesus Christ! Ugh! No! No! No! No! Nicky. Donna, what are you doing?. Come on, sweetie. You can come in. Come in the front - What"s the matter?. Come here. Come here, sweetie. No! - Damn it! - No! - What"s wrong with you?. - I want to talk to my mother! Stop. Stop! Listen! Listen! It"s all right! - No. - Get - - I want to see my mother. - What is it, sweetie?. - What happened?. - I don"t want you! Get the - Get away! Get - Get away! - Come on. - Come in the house. Why won"t you let me see my mother?.! No! Why won"t you let me see my mother?.! Donna! Why?.! Come in the house. Stay here. Your mom"s inside. God damn you, I"m gonna kill you! Get down! You! Get in the car! Stay back there, or I"ll break your hand! You just shut up! - I"m sorry. - No! Stop the "sorry" shit! You had some prospects, but now you"re just a fucking drug addict! You"re just a fucking junkie! You"re just a junkie! I smoked my pot, and I drank my share. Nothing like this. That"s my only daughter. And I"m not giving her hand to you. Fuck. Are you just saying this to scare me or something?. The last thing I want to do is fucking scare you! I want to kill you! Just stay there. - Irv, wait! - Stop it! Get out of the car! Get the fuck out of the car. Get the fuck out of the car! Get out! Get out! Right. This way! This way! I can"t let you have your car today. But I"m gonna bring it by tomorrow. And you just have to get cleaned up and get out of town. Because if you ever come by my house again and try to see my daughter, I"m gonna kill you! Good luck. Don"t move. Stay there. Good luck! Jesus! So... how long you been sleeping with him?. Excuse me?. Who the hell do you think you"re talking to?. Larry! The guy who just left his cigarettes here! Get out of my bathroom! You"re a traitor, Mom. He raped Donna! You"re just on drugs. He tried to kill me, too! You know what?. You don"t look so good. Too many drugs. Just like your father! Esper! You are not taking that picture out of my house! Where are you going?.! Mexico! Esper! Okay. What"s your big fucking emergency?. My $200,000 is going down the road. Say what?. Esper"s headed for Mexico in my GTO. Your 200 grand is a wash. Excuse me?. Oh. Look at it, "cause that"s the last fucking time you"re gonna see it. You are past it. You want your money?. Your money no longer exists because your husband was a fucking junkie. I don"t believe you. Oh, you don"t believe me, huh?. Why don"t you go ask Irv Huffman?. I was willing to kill my son for you. And this is how you pay me back?. Larry... baby. Christ, get the fuck off of me. Off of me! Larry?. Larry! Larry! DONNA: Mm. Does it hurt?. No. Feels so good. Mm. Are you thinking about it?. Let"s not talk now. I"m fine. I love you, Esper. I just pretend like I never had anyone inside me before now. I love you, too. I want you to pretend. I don"t want it to feel like I"d ever hurt you. You ready to get the hell out of here, huh?. - Yes. - I sure am, too. Do you love me?. - Y eah. - Y eah?. I love you, too. God damn! The story of my life, huh?. God damn it! Pop open that glove box. I"ll get him, but if I don"t kill him, you aim for his face. You shoot him in the goddamn face. Don"t get out! Aah! Fuck! God damn it! No! Raindrop. Of course I"m with you.
