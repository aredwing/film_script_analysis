After we caught them, we cut off their hands and feet. Then we hanged them with their own guts. After that, you drank their blood? First we carved the symbols on their skin. How much was left after you ate them? Not much. We burned what was left. We have reports of 86 people missing in the last six weeks. We've found 14 of them. Where are the other bodies? They're buried. You're going to tell me everything you know about Castaeda. I want the names of all his accomplices... ...every last detail. Then you'll take us to where the Nanga is. That's where the other bodies are, right? Some of them. Most of them. We've been reporting the arrest of the leader... of the satanic drug-trafficking cult... who's been terrorizing our city these last few months. The chief of police has arrived... to supervise this operation personally. What can you tell us about Castaeda's arrest? Everything's under control. Castaeda's in custody. And our curandero Marcelino has purified the site. And here's Castaeda, the leader... The most wanted criminal in recent times. What's up, Carlos? Hi, Oscar. Want some gum, Don Carlos? Bad news, right? Depends on your line of work, Carlos. Alex. Here's a man who's earned his reputation. Unlike others. I know I shouldn't be telling you this. So why are you telling me? Mrs. Garza is afraid to leave her house. I don't know what you told her, but you scared her... more than you helped her. Who's the best curandero in town? I don't know. Cut the crap! Who do people call for spiritual healing? You, Alex. Exactly. I don't understand why this guy... dislikes how I treat my patients. Jealousy. Pure fucking jealousy. Carlitos, please don't mess with my clients. It's always the same. He takes my newspapers and never pays. CASTAEDA ESCAPES Just be glad you don't have to deal with death. I don't plan to. Good for you. That's why I don't mind you reading my papers. Because you honor your father. You're a good man. More important than that, Oscar, I pay. Hey, can I get a spell from you? What kind? I asked Mrs. Marjila out to dinner tonight... and I want it to go well. Eat this right before you pick her up. Not a minute sooner or later. What is it? Fresh mint. Yes, Dad, I'm fine. I've got to go. Will you give me your blessing? Okay, bye. Good morning. I'm looking for Don Carlos Gutirrez. That's me. How can I help you? The Don Carlos I'm looking for is twice your age. I also go by the name of Don Carlos. Come in. Does Don Carlos still live here? Are you a federal agent? Could you tell from my car? Would you show me your I.D., please? I'm sorry. I never forget, I don't know what I was thinking. Here you go. I always wanted to be a federal agent. What's your specialty? Ritualistic crimes and satanic worship. Where is... My father? Don Carlos died a few years ago. I'm sorry. It's okay, he was very old. I was hoping to find him here. I needed his help again. Did you know him? I was very ill when I was little. My father brought me to this house. Don Carlos performed rituals and purifications on me all day long. He saved my life. How strange. I don't remember you. The last night I was here... I dreamt that I was floating above the bed. And to this day, my father swears he actually saw me rise. Of course. You almost touched the ceiling. I always thought you were just a dream. You were in this room. Come and see. Of course I remember you. I remember the look in your eyes. I was only five. I still remember, really. Okay. Can I please have my badge back? Why didn't you become a federal agent? Because my father wanted me to be a curandero. He believed it was something you're born with. Don't you? You see so many things, so many lies. I'm sorry to have bothered you. Maybe there's someone else in town who can help me. Do you know anything about a guy named Alex? I think he studied with your dad. Alex Muoz. I think I'd better go with you. You said you knew nothing about this. My father helped you when you needed help, didn't he? He'd be very sad if I didn't do the same thing. Remember, I always wanted to be a federal agent. What do you have to lose? My life. And you, yours. Give me a chance. Okay. I'll explain on the way. Where to? Mexico City. ENTRY PROHIBITED Who's this guy? The curandero. I brought him to purify the station. Lieutenant Jess Gmez, Carlos Gutirrez. What are you doing? Somebody has to investigate what happened in there. Do you want to purify it? Why isn't anybody here? We thought your father would purify this place. Nobody wants to go in. They think it's cursed. You think so too? No, I don't think so. I'm sure. Castaeda is a powerful practitioner of Palo Mayombe. We thought we were protected, but as you can see... we were completely wrong. What happened? Castaeda escaped the day after he was arrested. Marcelino, the chief's curandero... was found hanging upside down... on that wall you're looking at. Nobody saw him leave. He also left a Nanga. That's how Castaeda marks his territory. That's why our men are afraid to return. They fear his curse. You don't believe in any of this, do you? The important thing is to get your men back to work. They have to understand that... Are you all right? Okay, then you're ready for more. This is where we're keeping Roberto Lpez. He led us to Castaeda, but after he escaped... he wouldn't talk to us anymore. I think he'll talk to you... if he believes you can protect him. Roberto Lpez? I'm Carlos Gutirrez. I'm a... I'm a curandero. I can help you. I'll leave my name and number. - What did he say? - Nothing at all. But I have some of the information you wanted. So he finally spoke? No, he has no tongue. He says they cut it out. What? Castaeda got into his cell somehow and tore out his tongue. He told you all that? He wrote it down. Chief, Mr. Carlos Gutirrez. He's too young to be Gutirrez. I'm his son. I'm glad you're still working, chief. You're setting a good example. It's important that... The chief believes he's also been cursed. That's why he hasn't left his desk for two days. Oh, shit. He wants you to purify him. Hurry up. Close your eyes. Keep them closed. Open your eyes. Show me. See? It's clean. You were never cursed. You should stop believing that crap. The station is clean. So go back to work. You call that a purification? I said I'd help you as much as I could. Anyway, half the curse is in their minds. Don't bullshit me. Something scared you so much you can't wait to get out of here. That's not true. No? Then why did you change the egg? All this stuff is going to your head. Give it to me! Give it to me! That was a good egg. Sorry. I was going to eat it. I'll get you another one. It's clean! Don't be afraid to be afraid, Carlos. I need you to help me fight this shit. Okay, then let's fight it. Where are we going? A Mithraic initiation ring. We're going to visit the dead. Mithraism dates back to the third century B.C. The only follower I know is Don Chi Chi. He often hangs out here. Let me do the talking. Don Chi Chi, this is my curandero, Carlos Gutirrez. Your father was a great man, and from what I can see... you've got a ways to go before you're like him. What brings you here on such a beautiful day, Magdalena Garca? This. My ring? I lost it a couple of days ago. Where'd you find it? In a Nanga. In the cell Castaeda escaped from. Do you have any idea why it was there? Perhaps it was stolen to put a curse on me. I have a lot of enemies. This one, for example. This is the worst one of all. Who? A dead man? Of course! They're the most harmful and dangerous. Really? Did your father only teach you to wipe your nose? He taught me superstitions were for ignorant people... ...and senile old men. Which are you? I'm sorry to have bothered you. We won't do it again. Forgive my curandero for being so rude. Just a minute. You've got your father's spirit. What do you want from me? Not much. But this would be... a huge waste of time if you didn't tell us how to find Castaeda. You little prick. I'm going to give you an address. Castaeda may be very powerful... but he still needs the power of money in this rotten, corrupt city. Go to this address. Don Chi Chi, my respect and gratitude. Be careful, son of Gutirrez. If not, the world you're looking for... will consume you as it did your father. What did he mean about your father? Forget it. He's an ignorant, senile old man. Call us when it's purified. What? Nobody'll go in until you purify it. I'm going in alone? Why do you think I brought you? How about giving me a gun? Where'd you find him, doing magic tricks in the street? Good luck. Magdalena! Magdalena, it's clean! Magdalena! It's clean! It's clean! Magdalena! Magdalena! Carlos! Carlos! Oh, my God. Search every corner of the house. This isn't Palo Mayombe... or satanism. What's he trying to do? I don't know. But whatever it is... he's challenging the spirits. Thank you, officer. Bring Mr. Gutirrez some clean clothes. It's a long list. Victims? I don't know. But if that's the case... Don Chi Chi is in serious trouble. Listen to me, you son of a bitch! I don't care if Castaeda rips off your dick! Write down where I can find him right now! Understand? Roberto, how about we get you something... for that sweet tooth? That'll make you feel better. Right? So this is where you get the drugs? Is this where you get the drugs? Let me do the talking. Mr. Blascoe? I'm Detective Garca. How are you? It's a pleasure to meet you. You're very beautiful. I'm wondering why you would waste such beauty... on something as unglamorous as law enforcement. I wouldn't be happy doing anything else. We're here to investigate the Castaeda case. The so-called satanic drug leader? I hope this time you manage to put him in jail. For our families' sake. Hello, I'm Carlos Gutirrez. Javier Gonzlez. But everyone calls me Javiertico. Is she your girlfriend? No, I'm just her curandero. What a waste. What are you doing here, Javiertico? I work for Mr. Blascoe. I'm his... Twin? Mr. Blascoe has a bad heart... so every year he hires a private organ donor. If his heart gives out... the donor would have to give him his heart. Of course, the pay is generous... and the chances for survival are very good. And you're this year's donor? Two more months and I'm out. Sounds like a good deal. Well, sometimes... I dream his heart has stopped... and that I wake up with my chest cut open and a thank-you note... where my heart used to be. Maybe you can help me control my dreams. Didn't you say you're a curandero? Yes. No! No! No! Please! Please! Drink it slowly, Javiertico. But it's what he didn't say... that makes me suspect he's with Castaeda. We'll get him sooner or later. Son of a bitch! Motherfucker! That motherfucker got away! Let's go! I don't understand how it happened. How did he escape? What if he didn't escape? What? What if they took him? I don't know. This is all so strange. Maybe we should... What's that guy doing? I'm sick of this fucking city. Everybody does whatever they want. Shit! They fucked up my windshield! Motherfuckers! Shoot anything that moves! Attention all units! Unit 25 needs backup! I repeat: Unit 25. Between Santiago and Las Torres. I repeat... One, two, three! You said you wanted to be a cop. I've never fired one of these before. Cover me. I'm going around the back. Don't run, assholes! Carlos. Carlos. What's wrong? Hold on. It's okay. Carlos, can you do anything? Castaeda's operations are financed mainly... with drug money. And his religion protects the drug dealers. So his followers must be drugged to believe in his powers. Just like Roberto. Don't you think? Maybe, but I don't think so. The thing is that Castaeda's people are scared to death. Fear makes people do strange things... even kill. I'm going home. You need a real curandero. I can't do any more here. Okay. I'll arrange for your trip back. So you're the new little curandero. You know you're not skilled enough for this. You're no better than your father. The sad thing is that you're no worse. For all of his fame, Gutirrez was completely useless... incapable of doing anything but hallucinating once in a while. You didn't know my father, so don't pretend that you did. I knew your father very well. He was a hack. Mediocrity runs in your family. Why don't you go back to your little town and stay there? You'll live longer if you do. I'm going to get the chief's approval and... book your ticket, okay? So, curandero, what do you say? Should I give you another chance... or should I kill you once and for all? After all, a life of mediocrity isn't very gratifying... is it? If you kill me now, you're a dead man. There are more than 50 armed police officers here. You don't say, curanderito. And what makes you think... I was... ever here? It leaves at 6:00? Just a minute. I'm booking your ticket right now. Cancel it. I'm staying. - What? - I said I'm staying. Excuse me, sir. There's a message for you. MEET ME AT... A shot of tequila. Are you looking for me? Alex, what are you doing in Mexico City? You know, the usual. The same as you, bro. I got your note and came. Now tell me what's happening. I wanted to apologize because the other day... I was a total asshole. I didn't mean to offend you, you know. Yeah, I know. You're the best, and you just want the whole world to know it. And you know why I'm the best? Here. Reach into my pocket. Go on, it won't bite. I'm the best because I've got something you don't. Do you like it? What are you involved in? What? What? I can't hear you! Come on, Carlitos. I have a proposition for you. Why don't we work as a team? - Are you kidding? - Think about it. Me and you. I'm not interested. You'll change your mind. And when you do, you know where to find me. Call me! - Who was that guy? - Alex Muoz. - Does he know anything? - Not as much as he thinks. Let's wait till he leaves. Courtesy of Mr. Muoz. Cheers. So he wants to play. Thanks. This is Unit 25. I need you to follow a guy named Alex Muoz. He's in a bar located... between Viga and San Pedro. Over. Unit 25, over and out. First Don Chi Chi, then Roberto, and now Alex appears out of nowhere. How did he find me? There must be an informer. That doesn't bother you? Look, right now there's nothing we can do about it. But we can go and eat something. I'm starving, aren't you? I know a place with great steaks. I'm a vegetarian. This place will make you change your religion. Where do you get the dough for a place like this? I know the owner. Check this out. Tasty. And you wanted to be a cop? Your father was right. Cops are shit. But you're a cop. What are we dealing with? How would I know? They drink blood. They yank out spinal cords, chop up bodies. You want some dessert? I don't understand how you can eat that stuff. Relax, kid. I'm on a diet. A high protein diet. Look, I've lost 12 pounds already. Tell me, how did your father die? He... He went crazy. How? He had visions and they overpowered him. What kind of visions? I'm not sure. My father would say they started slowly... but little by little, they became more intense. Do you have them too? - What? - The visions. I didn't used to. And now? Magdalena. I spoke to the chief. He wants you and Carlos to come back to the office immediately. Really? That's strange. I didn't get a call. He asked me to tell you personally. It's an emergency requiring the utmost discretion. Okay, wait for us and we'll follow you. As usual, the chief is kicking my ass. Let's go. - Gmez is one of them. - What are you talking about? Trust me. What are you doing? Let go of me! Not her, you asshole! Get her! One room. Two. Yes, Dad. I'm fine. Really. Yes, I'm fine. I have to go. Give me your blessing. Okay, bye. My Dad says "hi. " Mine too. I dreamt about him last night. Do you dream about him often? No, that's why I think it's weird. All of this is affecting me psychologically. Why don't you believe in what you do, Carlos? It's not that I don't believe. I think what I do has benefits, but... psychological benefits. For example, the purification works when the person believes. Most of the time the sickness is in their minds. Like an exorcism? An exorcism, a purification. Call it what you want. It all starts and ends here. Really? Then why don't you do one for me? What? I want you to purify me. Right now? Look, with all the shit surrounding me these last few weeks... I'm an ass for not asking you sooner. You know, I'm easy prey. Okay. I'll be right back. Where are you going? For a new egg. This one's seen too much. Gentlemen... We have a problem. That fucking curandero has grabbed the policewoman. You know why? Because there's a traitor among us. What's wrong, Gmez? Don't you like the power I'm giving you? Does it make you nauseous? They only sell them by the carton. I'm scared, Carlos. Close your eyes. I'm afraid of Castaeda... his followers... everything that's happening to us. More than anything, I'm afraid of myself... of what I am. What do you mean? My family was very poor. We lived in the country. One day, my mother was found dead. She had just given birth... to me... her only daughter. When they found us, she was surrounded by goats. Why? My body was covered in goat's milk. Some people thought I was a saint... others thought I was the devil's daughter. That's how the gossip got started. The witch doctors sought me out... at all hours. They wore me out! Is that why you came to my father's house? He freed me from the devil that overpowered my soul during the rituals. He saved my life. I think he cast a spell to protect me. But that spell's been broken. I can feel it. I think Castaeda knows who I am. That's why they're chasing us. My father saved you many years ago. Now it's my turn. Besides, they don't know we're here. We're safe, for now. Hey, what are you doing? I was rubbing it over your heart. So... rub it over my heart. Is that all? Yes, I'm done. Let's crack it open and read the verdict. May I? It's hot. Yes, it shouldn't be. What kind of a trick was that? Get out! Go! Magdalena! Let me in! Magdalena! Get some rags! GOA STRONG CURSE SOON IT BECAME NECESSARY TO CAST ANOTHER SPELL TO WARD OFF THE I dreamt you were sad and desperate, Carlos. You never thought you'd see the things you're seeing now. When people betray their ideals, they free their demons. It's time, so come quickly. You'll see a rooster. It'll point the way. You didn't think I was alive, did you? Why didn't you tell anyone you were alive? Especially me. You could've helped so many people. No, not in the condition I was in, son. The visions were overwhelming. I couldn't walk down the street... without seeing all the evil around me. But we'll talk later. First a toast to our reunion. Cheers, son. Cheers. When did the visions begin? The terrified faces... black eyes, rotting teeth... the image of your own death? A few days ago. You were born a curandero, Carlos. You were born with the ability to see people's souls. And with that gift, you see not only the good... but also the evil. The visions emerge from the depths of the human soul. But how do I combat them? You have to use them to make you strong. It's the only way. Hurry, son! We have to save that girl! How do you know? I saw her floating in your dreams. Didn't I? Years ago, I told her I was sure I'd see her again. It's time to keep that promise. Turn around and look at this. Do you know who I am? No. Then I'm a stranger. Are you supposed to talk to strangers? No, but you're an old man. You can't hurt us. I see. But when you go visit that guy... instead of going to school... do you ask yourselves if he might hurt you? He showed you his hunting knife, didn't he? One thing you never want to see again... is that knife. I advise you never to go back there. Let's go. He's crazy. Run! You see? You have to interpret the signs. Were you looking for me? Where'd you learn that cheap trick, Carlitos? Here's another one. You're finally doing things my way, Carlitos. What have you done with Magdalena? Tell me. Let go, asshole! You're a dead man. You're a fucking dead man. You can't talk to me that way, motherfucker. Shut up, little man. Answer my question. Tell me, where is Magdalena? I can't. They won't kill me. Death would be merciful. They... What did they do to Magdalena? She's what Castaeda's been looking for all this time. He says she'll make him immortal. I was supposed to keep her under control... until she was ready. But she has changed a lot, Carlos. I don't even know where she is. I don't know where she went. Good job, little man. Very, very good. You're going to take us to Castaeda. Whatever you say. There she is! She followed you here! Stop it! Go! Calm down, it's me! I wasn't able to help her much. The only way to free her is to get rid of Castaeda. I will, Father. But how can I help you? My fate... is in destiny's hands. Alex, tell me, where's Castaeda? Tell me, if you want to save your soul. Talk through Magdalena. You'd better be telling the truth, asshole! Tell me, Alex. Promise me you'll save my soul. There's one more thing you need to do. Where's Castaeda? Bring him right now! That won't be necessary, Mr. Blascoe. I'm here. I'm always here. Everything's gone to hell, Castaeda. This isn't what we agreed! Where's my daughter? Please, Blascoe. You, more than anyone, know the kind of sacrifice... that's necessary to keep you alive. Did you kill my daughter? Come on, Blascoe. She was only a little girl. Shit! No! Please, no! No! Please! Shut him up! Where do you think you're going? Kill him! Ah, her soul. With it, I'll be immortal. Not even you and your father together could save her. I have my own destiny. What are you going to do now, curanderito? Sacrifice yourself... for this? It's the only way. You deserve something worse than death. Drop the knife, Gutirrez! Drop it, motherfucker! Drop it or we'll shoot! Castaeda is ours. You're destined to lose, curandero. Fucking curandero. What are you doing here, curanderito? Well... as long as you're here, come in. Nice of you to visit me. It's the least I can do. How's our dear policewoman? She's dying. It's the least she could do. I have to purify her soul. But that's impossible as long as you're alive. What can I tell you, curanderito? Everything's under control... and I'm backed by the men upstairs. They wouldn't do anything harmful to me... or rather, to themselves. So you cut yourself a pretty good deal. Oh, curandero. You don't know half of what goes on around you. I have friends weak in their hearts and minds... who are very influential. If you only knew how short my visit here will be. In fact... I should even be protected from visits like yours. I don't know who you talked to to get in here. But don't worry, when I tell them you were here... Castaeda! What makes you think that I was ever here? Hey, you! Shut the fuck up! I told you to shut up, asshole! One last thing... Castaeda was found dead in his cell. No one knows how he died. The cell was locked. He killed himself? No. Impossible. He was found crucified, with his guts hanging out. Feel better soon, Magdalena. See you. What's up with you two? Nothing you need to worry about ever again. Why did you leave? I had to find my father. He saved you again. No. It was you, Carlos. Are you starting to believe in this? When they see you wearing this, they'll know you're protected. "They"? Yes, "they. " They're everywhere, all the time. Get some rest. When will I see you again? Call me when you get out. I found a restaurant with great steaks. Carlos! It's good to have you back. I'm home again, Oscar. Safe and sound. Isn't that what you always told me? Listen to Oscar. You should never leave your hometown. I told you. You shouldn't mess with death. CASTAEDA DIES Where there's life, there's hope, Carlos. Want some gum, Don Carlos? Listen carefully. When that man comes to pick up your mother tonight... don't let him in the house, okay? He carries a gun and that's very dangerous. Do you know how dangerous? Bad enough to keep you from becoming... the soccer player you've always wanted to be. Now give me some gum.
