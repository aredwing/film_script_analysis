Starring Shijaku Katsura Yoji Matsuda Eri Misawa Leo Morimoto Jun Haichi Kaori Kobayashi Hideo Murota Kyoko Enami Based on the novel "DOGRA MAGRA" by Kyusaku Yumeno Screenplay by Toshio Matsumoto Atsushi Yamatoya Producers Shuji Shibata Kazuo Shimizu Directed by Toshio Matsumoto Brother-in-law. Brother. It is me. Please say something. You're there, aren't you? Why don't you answer? Help me! Someone please! Anyone! He's been extremely agitated. He's asked where he is? Yes. Anything else? He asked his name. Of course we've said nothing. So it's exactly as before? Precisely, sir. Do you remember anything? Do you know who I am? I see. I am... Excuse me. My card. Department of Psychiatry, Kyushu University Hospital. Professor Kyotaro Wakabayashi. So this is... Yes. Room #7 in the psychiatric ward. Psychiatric? When our Dept. Head, Dr. Masaki suddenly passed away... a month ago. I temporarily took over. Does that mean that I'm insane? Insane? Why do you ask? I remember nothing. Not even my name, or yesterday... Not even my face. You've been through a hideous incident. Medically speaking, what we term amnesic trauma. A great shock? Please tell me, doctor. What happened? Who am I? That you'll have to resolve yourself. If your memory returns things will become clear. Please forgive me, I was wrong. Good morning. Morning. Forgive me. I'm so sorry, my sister. I betrayed you. Do you know her name? You remember her face? Brother-in-law! Why are you here? Do you know him? Calm yourself down. It'll come back. Now go to sleep. In the reign of Emperor Hsuan Tsung. There was a handsome young painter named Wu Ching-hsiu. The emperor was very fond of him. And gave him in marriage Dai, maid to his consort. Wu Ching-hsiu lived a blissful dream... with his beautiful bride Dai. With his... Sorry. Now the Emperor was besotted by his consort, Yang Kwei Fei and did whatever she suggested. She surrounded him with her foolish family... and connived to banish all worthy courtiers from his side. When Ching-hsiu saw this and the ignoring of portents, he worried greatly. His painting was the only way to show the emperor. He explained as much to his new bride. "Will you lay down your life for the good of the land?" "For you, I do so gladly." He journeyed to his secret mountain studio. And drank a final cup with his bride. "Let us meet again in the next life." He strangled her with his bare hands... then stripped the robes from her naked body. Feverishly he began to sketch. On a scroll, he painted the body... in various stages of putrefaction. His first aim, to let the emperor know... the intransigence of life. But the human body is quick to rot. His brush could not keep up with the decay. Upset, Ching-hsiu realized he needed yet another corpse. The madness was on him. He killed another with a field mattock. And carried her off to his studio. The villagers surrounded, then burnt his hideaway. With that, he gave up. He gathered up his unfinished scroll, his wife's jewels, her coral comb, some of her bones and put them in his robe. And ran for his life. But when he arrived back at his home, his bride Dai, called out then embraced him. Alas, it was her sister, the young Fen. A lithe young wench. "I know that it is wrong for I cannot help but love you." Said she, as she passionately wooed him. The now deranged Ching-hsiu took her to his bed. They fled the city and wandered the land. Their boat capsized in a storm. Both thought that the end had come. But a ship from Bohai did rescue them. And they travelled to Japan. One night Ching-hsiu either fell or jumped to a watery grave. The bereaved Fen wanted to follow him. But the child inside her prevented such a course. And she did bear a boy child. Fen wrote down all that had transpired on the scroll... and so it did pass down from generation to generation. Such is the tale. That girl in room #6, she's become the Fen of 1,100 years ago. So by sister she meant... She's referring to Dai. And brother-in-law is Ching-hsiu. Exactly. So, she's crazy, then. And thinks that I'm Ching-hsiu! Hilarious. It's not that simplistic. Which means? You're both direct descendants of Ching-hsiu and Fen. Ridiculous! No, it's been documented. The Wu family are direct descendants of Ching-hsiu. Professor Masaki spent years validating the concept of... - IPC, the Inherited Psychological Condition. - Inherited psychological condition? Yes. According to his research, the great shock felt by your ancestors... supersedes individual memories and passes through the bloodline. I can't believe it! Take a look at this. "Young medical student strangles his bride-to-be." "At Meinohama" "Master Ichiro Kure" "Night before the wedding" "His bride-to-be" "Moyoko Kure" The hideous incident that you referred to, isn't it? Yes. Five months ago, Ichiro Kure a medical student, on the night before his wedding, strangled to death his cousin, Moyoko. What do you mean? You're not saying l... Is it true, doctor? You have to remember! I'm not Ichiro Kure. Why not? He killed that Moyoko, right? So she can't be the girl in #6. Therefore, I'm not Ichiro! I see. Right? No connection at all. Does this scene jog a memory? "Dr. Masaki's Laboratory" That's Dr. Masaki's collection of specimens. Please look at them. Should one give you the slightest hint, perhaps it will bring back your past. Whatever's this? That patient cut his own arm off... with that knife, there. And this? He tried to poison his entire family. That cat was an ingredient. What's this, sir? A young university student wrote it in one session. A kind of novel. Extremely valuable in our research. "Dogra Magra." What's it mean? A chant used by a secret christian sect in Nagasaki. Preface. O fetus, O fetus, why do you undulate? Is it knowing mother's heart that fills you with dread? It's quite bizarre. Extremely so. Modeled the story line on himself... and wrote a mystery including Dr. Masaki and myself. Reading it is enough to send one mad. All jumbled, is it? Not at all, it's carefully planned. Sit yourself here and read for a spell. No thanks. This? You found it. That's Dr. Masaki. The slide narration was his voice. Pre-ordained, you finding his photograph. Picking up the Dogra Magra novel. Something's stimulated your deepest memories. Something made you stand here. And the "Embryo's Dream" you pick up... became his graduation thesis! Embryo's Dream? Do they dream? Of course they dream. In the 10 months that embryos gestate, they experience one long dream. Think of it as the reason for the gestation, this 10 months long dream they undergo. During this 10 months, the fetus... takes on characteristics of numerous of our earthly species. And absorb all the memories of their ancestors... into each of their billions of cells before being born. Hence, the mental and physical development of the embryo... depends on the ancestral memories... or the embryonic dream. You remember something? No, but Dr. Masaki... What about him? Nothing. He certainly seems different... with such a collection. We all considered him eccentric. His doings are beyond the ken of most folk. He completed many great scholarly achievements. But his most outstanding accomplishment was... the creation of the Freedom Cure Experimental Grounds. There are 10 examples of IPC. Dharma faced a stone wall for 9 years... and became a great spiritual leader. To make us all as one, an lmperial Japanese Dharma Association needs be formed. For the sake of our lmperial Highness, the Emperor. Matters not if it's a wall of stone or wood. The first step needs to be taken! Professor! Professor Masaki. It's you, is it? I read your article. It had a great impact. Your brilliant prose. The editorial staff, became too confused. They just couldn't work it out. A good reaction. But you should be careful not to... get your very self tricked by your own brain. Exactly. Could you give me more detail on that? What's that? I have trouble with your... "the brain is not a thinking organ." Because the brain is almighty. The brain likes to imagine it's the greatest of all. As in, "I think, therefore I am." Just a moment. She thinks she's Anna Pavlova. The black clouds so low Lined up as they are As they fly across the sky When you look at the western sky What are you filming? A detective story. Detective story? The brain searching for the brain itself. A patient, I call him Loony-Lad, is the main character. A good lad and smart as well. I see. But suddenly one day he had a manifestation. He's been here ever since. Is that true? You're such a doubter. If you want I'll take you to him. We've got him in room #7. Alright. And then? Well, after that he was amnesic for a while. Then he returned to a semblance of normality... before completely forgetting everything. You remember something? Do you know who I am? Forgot again, did you? It's alright. I'm Keishi Masaki. Head of the hospital psychiatry section. Psychiatry? So I'm insane, am I? Insane? Why say that? I don't remember anything. Not even my name. You had a manifestation. Now you've lost your memory. How can I get it back? Who am I? Calm yourself down. Earlier you screamed out loud. Identify why, and it'll come back. I had a dream. Yes? A frightening dream. The world was at an end. Or perhaps it was a beginning. A woman suddenly opened her arms, then looked so hurt. No, it wasn't that. Yes, go on. I can't remember. Where do our memories reside? A very good question. Searching for that gem is as difficult as finding our soul. Most doctors place it in the brain. I hold that it's in the entire body. And the brain acts as a movie screen. After I told the lad that, he was so interested in the brain. He started asking me numerous questions, then reading. He's still functioning well. And he often makes learned speeches to himself. Brains, which exiled god from the world, have taken the throne of the gods. Becoming dictators, what have they done to human culture? Brains have created weapon after weapon... and tried to make us kill each other off. They brought us light, belittling the sun, moon and stars. They gave us machines and have destroyed nature. They created pollution and its subsequent maladies. What is the reality of the brain? Strangely, the brain has not studied the brain itself. And there are no cures for mental illness. Patients have been put behind bars all over the world. They're not treated as human beings. Why, I ask, are other patients treated differently... from those who suffer from mental illness? What defines normality and abnormality? You, yourselves live in the bustling city, you carry on with your normal lives. Sometimes you do abnormal things. You tire and feel as if someone is watching you. And you suffer from your persecution mania. Most of you have experienced this abnormality. So the normal folk have this tendency. Those we call insane, have it to a greater degree. A genius, or one who is fixated on one subject... is also referred to as being crazy. Notably, Dr. Masaki is a typical crazy professor. Even a doctor, how can he distinguish madness? A pulse, examining a tongue? Where can he cut? Can't see it on an X-ray. More mysterious than a fart. How can we examine it? You know it can't be cured and an asylum doesn't help. Committing them doesn't give you peace of mind. For the patient it's the end and the doctors lots of bucks. A pit of horror stories. They get you in and get your bucks. Bung him in the loony bin and watch the bugger squeal. Can't escape from there and hardly anybody knows. How could they? Be quiet! Shut up! Like this Loony-Lad, he's taken my Freedom Cure... and has recovered some of his faculties. Sometimes he expounds on his theories of the brain. But essentially he's plagiarizing my theories. The lad has memorized it so well. Sometimes, I even go listen to refresh my mind. Doctor Masaki has given me the nickname Prof. Loony-Lad. Does that mean the humans exist for the brain's sake? Or do brains exist for we humans? That deserves deep consideration. The god-exiling brains will destroy not only humans... but also the world itself. In order to prevent this, I will cast this thinking brain to the ground. And stamp on it. Just watch! Interesting case, eh? Then Loony-Lad lapses into unconsciousness. But Professor, why do the detective and criminal knock each other out? Because both are the same entity. The brain entraps itself. And the revelation of it is also the brain. Put another way. The brain thinks the brain doesn't think. According to the brain's thinking. But that gets nowhere. So, after Loony-Lad wakes up again, he goes through the very same process. Unreasonably reasonable. You're saying that's me? What do you think? It's... as if it were a stranger. Wakabayashi speaking. Tomorrow? That's October 10 at 3 p.m. Very good. Professor... Isn't tomorrow September 10? Why? The calendar. That's left as it was a month ago. But why? Dr. Masaki stopped using it after that. What? That's the day that he died. He committed suicide. But why? We're not certain. You don't think that... His will. Today, I handed the dean my resignation. My Freedom Cure Experiment was successful... until yesterday's incident on September 8, 1926. The incident proves beyond doubt my IPC theory. My inability to prevent yesterday's tragedy was a failure. But in retrospect, Wakabayashi's visit after Ichiro's second manifestation... wasn't totally unexpected. At that time... Why does it stop there? Quite mysterious. I remember well the visit to him. Definitely a case of an Inherited Psychological Condition. I've been involved for two years. By two years, you mean? The case where the mother was murdered. That too was the Kure lad. Makes sense. Then, I suspected someone other than the lad. But never did find the culprit. Even with your keen eye? I am ashamed. Clearly a case of murder. But no clues to the perpetrator. Interesting. Then the Bride Case happened. So it was Ichiro Kure? I doubt it. But it was made to appear that way. It's all documented here. "August 15, 1924. Murder at Nogata, the first manifestation." Recognize her? Someone you know well. Who? My... mother. Yes, it's coming back. Yes, that's your mother. I'm Yayoko, Ichiro's aunt. Ichiro, come here. My sister and I lived at Meinohama prior to Ichiro's birth. When I married, Chiseko departed... saying she would stay unwed and continue her career. Seven months later she wrote of Ichiro's birth. Later, I realized she had a lover here. I've no idea who the father is. I did ask once back at Fukuoka. In a flood of tears she wouldn't say. I didn't push her. But at that time... she had it in for what she calls "those lying, learned men." I see. Did anything change after that visit? She was afraid of our whereabouts becoming known. Why was that? I think a fortune teller told her something. Specifically, what? I don't know. But she said not to say anything. I see. Well... I'd like you to go over that night again. That night I suddenly woke up. Wake up with you! What is it? - Playing possum, eh! - You're under arrest for murder! Hold him. Come on you! Come on! What the hell! What are you doing? I don't think it's so clear cut. If he's the culprit what's the motive? Well, obviously it wasn't a stranger. No fingerprints or footprints. The door prop could've been deliberately placed. So if it wasn't Ichiro, surely the struggle would've woken him? He could have been chloroformed. In my opinion, it was a strong man... with access to and knowledge of chloroform. Obviously a learned man. Then, where's the motive? That's the block. Interesting, eh? Dr. Masaki! Surprised, are you? Very good. You remembered my name. "Madness Masaki." Don't be afraid, I'm not a ghost. Sit yourself down. Wakabayashi has left the room. He's told you so many lies he's afraid to face me. Still don't understand? Me dying a month ago. That business with the calendar. They're all lies. That will you read, suddenly finished. I stayed overnight to put things in order. I started the will after doing the calendar this morning. That's today's date, no mistake. September 9, 1926. But Dr. Wakabayashi... Listen, this is the truth. I was writing my will... That's Dr. Masaki's collection of specimens. Please look at them. Should one give you the slightest hint, perhaps it will bring back your past. And I left the will on the desk. When I realized, it was too late. He read it while you were busy. That gave him an idea. Great quack that he is. He knew I was hiding in the room. No shame with his baldfaced lies. But why would he do that? He had to think quickly. Listen. All the things that he did and said today... were to make you believe in two main points. First, that you are Ichiro Kure. Second, to make you suspicious of me. But... These things happen. That document he showed you is typical. You see, Ichiro's IPC was brought on... by his mother laying there. He was sleepwalking. His genetic memory suddenly and spontaneously exploded. So it was Ichiro? Yes, but without actual intent, it's not legally murder. The Bride Case, a full two years later confirms that. Obviously Wakabayashi is being foolish. The Bride Case documents. Wakabayashi wants to believe that it wasn't Ichiro. Here, madam? Not there. Then where? Over there. Oh, doctor, thank you. It's just terrible. You needn't get up. How's the wound? It's not about me. I want you to find the culprit. Who could be so cruel? Madam, you must rest. Doctor, please listen. I'm all ears. He's shown him the scroll. This scroll? May I keep it? He showed it to Ichiro. He knows. Why do such a thing? It happened yesterday. Ichiro said he'd be back by two. He went to town. And didn't return by three. Not like him at all. So I went to search for him. He always takes the same route. I expected to meet him on the road. So I rushed up to the cape. Master! You surprised me, Sengoro. Why are you here? Your aunt is worried. I came to get you. I'm sorry. Master, what's that scroll? This? The emperor? What's written on it? A very mysterious story and horrid pictures. He insisted I see it before the wedding ceremony. He? Who gave it to you? An acquaintance of my late mother. She gave it to him to keep. He came to return it to me. I know who he is. But I can't tell anyone. I want you to promise not to tell anyone. Alright? That night, as dawn was approaching. I woke to go to the toilet. Master. Madam! Sengoro? Yes. Please wake up. The young master and Moyoko are both missing. Have you seen him with a scroll recently? Yes, yesterday up at the cape, he was reading a scroll of some sort. We must find them, soon! Yes! Madam! Get the ladder! Hurry up! Ichiro, what are you doing? A moment, please. The body will start rotting soon. No, not yet. It's already morning. Please come and have breakfast. Yes. Get the doctor! Go, go get the doctor. Yes. Hurry! Do you realize what you're doing? Where did you get that scroll? Someone gave it to you? No. I know you're lying. You were seen reading it up at the cape. Who gave it to you? Tell me. Don't get in my way. In your way? Whatever! I must show it to the emperor. What are you saying? Give it to me. What do you say? Better than a pulp mystery. Did it really happen? Of course. Look at the newspaper articles. "Bride Strangled on Wedding Eve" That's... You recall something? Dr. Wakabayashi showed me it this morning. No wonder you remember. Nothing else comes to mind? That's what he asked. But I remember nothing. It makes no sense to me. So I asked him why the dead Moyoko is in room #6. Of course. What did Wakabayashi say? He didn't answer. Of course not. He was trying to trap you. What do you mean? I'll explain. At 10 p.m. On the night of May 15, 1926... when the bride was murdered. I left here for my home. As I walked past the pathology department. "Morgue" He suddenly slashed her open. Her organs spilled out before my very eyes. Her lungs were all black. Perhaps she'd worked in a coalmine. Her liver bled profusely. But the monster gave it nary a thought. After playing with her organs he sewed her back up. Then ripped her scalp off. Smashed her skull. Scooped out her eyeballs and ripped off her nose. She looked like a monster. It appeared to me as if he got some kind of... twisted, abnormal thrill from doing it. "Hair of the deceased - Moyoko Kure" Shocked, eh? But it's the truth. Here! The photographs to prove it. Dr. Wakabayashi? But why? It's clear that he swapped her for Moyoko. And in the four months since then, he's had Moyoko hidden away. What are you doing here? The girl in room #6? It's been empty until yesterday. After yesterday's incident when I handed in my resignation... I noticed the light on in room #6. I thought it strange and sent someone in. Seems that Wakabayashi had put a young lass in there. That way inclined, I thought. You mean... Yes. Wakabayashi's the demon. That's when I realized the connection with... the case of the murdered bride. I agree that IPC brought on the incident. But I want to know who, if at all, it was... who triggered it by showing him the scroll. You're saying that the case validates your current research? Exactly. With that, I analyzed each step in detail. Here are my results. I'm particularly interested in the scroll, as you know. The Wu Ching-hsiu scroll? Yes, it proves beyond doubt IPC in Ichiro's case. I see. Doctor, I want you to study this from your point of view... and I'd like you to examine Ichiro yourself. Yes, of course. "Fukuoka District Court" Insanity is quite complicated. Science cannot measure it. Professor. Here's Ichiro Kure. Good work. Do you know that man? Yes. He's my father. Father? That's great. Who am I? My father. Well, I never! So you have two fathers? Absolutely fascinating. You know both our names? That's enough. Don't force it. No matter which you choose, it's unfair. That's how Ichiro was committed to the asylum. Makes you think that the roots of his fate are deep, indeed. Oh yes. I've something to show you. Come over here. "Freedom Cure Experimental Grounds. July 20, 1926." What are you looking at? Give me a mattock, too. There's a trowel over there. Thank you. What's this? Jewels, human remains and a coral comb. But I wanted a mattock. I can't dig with this. What will you dig? There's a girl's body buried here. Alright? Are you okay? I'll open the window. I'm alright. Is that really me? You recall something? No, not really. But I feel kind of strange. Come and get some fresh air. You can see the grounds from here. What are you looking at? Look, there's the real Ichiro Kure. What do you see? Just like the film. Including Ichiro, there are 10 of them. You really see them, don't you? Of course I can. I thought it was strange. No wonder I remember nothing. Which way is Ichiro facing? He's had his back to me. I thought as much. Watch closely. He'll soon turn around. He did! How did you know? He's the image of me. You both share the same mother. So Ichiro and I are twins? More than that. He is you. He is me? Ichiro and l... The Doppler Effect. Your double. Shadow. Your illusion created another you. Illusion? That's not an illusion. That's Ichiro Kure. Very good. Everything I said was a lie. What? I was testing you. Let's leave it. I'll explain everything. Here's the scroll in question. Open it up. The girl from room #6. Exactly. IPC theory itself is frightening, but so is the reality of it. Got you worried, eh? No matter how much he wanted to jolt the emperor. Why do you think he went over the edge? Heroism? There's that, too. Fame and artistic ambition are there, too. Besides the abnormality of showing it to others, there's the aspect of sexual perversion in there. Sexual perversion? While he was sketching her rotting carcass. He forgot his love of country and fame. And the sheer joy of doing it took over. When he died his seed still carried the hideous memories. His sexual perverison was handed down through the ages. And that scroll is the catalyst for the genetic flashbacks. Please stop! You recall something? Who was it who showed it to Ichiro? I wonder who. Was it me? You the criminal and he the victim? Very interesting. But if we're twins and I was jealous of Moyoko? The opposite is a possibility, too. The opposite? So I'm that Ichiro? Wait, if I'm Ichiro... You're getting all confused. Do you know? Who's the guilty one? I am. Never... According to Wakabayashi's research. That's what he wants you to think. But why would he do that? He wants all the credit. We were classmates at medical school. We were both interested in the supernatural. And latched onto the legend at the same time. Way back then? Yes. At first we worked together. We thought the scroll was destroyed but then heard... that Chiseko Kure had found it in a statue. So we both fought over who would get to Chiseko first. It was then that Chiseko fell pregnant. She had a baby boy on November 20, 1907. She registered it as a bastard. And raised the boy alone. She hid herself away. She knew that we both were waiting for the appropriate moment. If we had the scroll and Ichiro to experiment with, she could say which one of us was the father... and expose our research and criminal doings. She stood in our way. Stop it! It's horrible! We both had equal motives. I don't want to hear any more. You're both revolting! What's that? Isn't that right? You kill and torture for your research. What about the Kure family? Is anything allowable in the name of science? No, never! I never considered! Listen to me. You and Ichiro... I know nothing about me and Ichiro! I want no part of your experiments. Wait! You're wrong. It's for your sake. I hate it! I don't want anyone taking care of me. I am me! Ichiro Kure! Yes! I'm Ching-hsiu. Fool! Yes, I'm an insane fool. I'd rather be insane. Stop it. I'm going insane. I can feel myself going insane. Open up! Open up! What's wrong? It won't open. But it's empty. Been locked for ages. But Dr. Masaki just... Dr. Masaki? Don't be silly. He died over a month ago. But he was here! Don't you mean Dr. Wakabayashi? He was over there. Shall I call him? But he was here. Have a look, then. Don't you remember what you did? What do you mean? I can't believe it. I'll be over there. Dr. Wakabayashi will soon return. Please tell me. What did I do? Lunch is ready. Father, I found a model. I can finish the scroll. Give me the scroll like you did at the cape. What are you on about? "Knowing my child suffers does darken my soul... but future promise does lighten the tomorrow... Tokyo, November 26, 1907. Ichiro Masaki's mother, Chiseko. To Dr. Keishi Masaki." Mother. "Dr. Masaki committed suicide." Where are you going? Brother-in-law. Brother-in-law. Moyoko. Brother-in-law!
