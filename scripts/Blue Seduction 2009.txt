The phenomenal hit was used in television commercials, animated cartoons, and national election campaigns. Mikey Taylor had several famous run-ins with the law due to drug and alcohol abuse, and a series of paternity suits. His failure to follow up "Flash in the Pan" with any other hit caused Taylor to spiral. Then in 1990, he met and married Joyce Green, his most diligent and loyal fan. The pair moved to small-town Vermont where it seemed that Mikey Taylor was on the long road to recovery. But in the pop world, American lives always have a second act. Man, I'm dying here, Mikey. She's not gonna show up. Like, let's just call it a night. All right. I'll call the agency tomorrow and have them send over another girl. I'll call the agency tomorrow and have them send over another girl. That or you sing it. Hi! Hi, everybody. I'm so sorry I'm late. I couldn't get a cab and then there was traffic. But I'm here now and I'm ready to go, if that's okay still. I've been working on your songs all night. And I have to say they are truly a piece of art. L... I am so honored to be able to work... with you, Mr. Taylor. Hi. I'm Mike. Oh my gosh. You... you are Mikey Taylor. - Call me Mike. - Mikey Taylor from The Saints. Oh! "Flash in the Pants!" Pan. Oh. I actually lost my virginity to that song. Really? Yeah, I was listening to MTV Vault and... it was so funny. Funny? Was it really? Well, no, it actually made me relax. So thanks. Well, that's good. No, but that's amazing... Oh, no, it was not great at all. But I got a lot better at it. I'm glad to hear that. So why don't we do "Big Night" and move on to "Danger"? All right. Good luck. Right right right. I'm at the studio now. I'll talk to him, okay? Yeah, don't worry. Don't worry. I'll get back to you. Mike, I need to know when you're gonna have the last three songs. I don't know. They were due a month ago. Oh, man. You are gonna blow this publishing deal, kiddo, which I busted my ass to get for you, huh? This is it, babe- the end of the line. If you don't deliver, you'll owe them your advance, and they keep the songs that you already gave them. - You get it? - Yeah, I get it. That's a hell of a deal you crafted there, Dicky. You gotta remind me to raise your back end. - You good? - I'm good. Okay. I just need a time frame, Mike. Please tell me. All right. I'll have them... when I have them. Stanley, will you please help me out here? Look at the pretty girl, Dicky. - Wow. - Yeah. - Can she sing? - Does it really matter? All right, let's see what we got here. Todd, put up the first track and bring up the levels. Matty, you ready to go? Yeah, I'm ready. J' I'll take it out all night J' J' And I'll sleep all day J' J' A slight hangover J' J' ls such a small price to pay J' J' You better catch that ring J' J' 'Cause life is swinging by much too fast J' J' And once you recall the good times J' J' Baby, that's all that's gonna last J' J' So let's have a big night J' J' Ooh, let's have a big night J' J' Ooh, babe... J' Wow, hey! What do you think of that? I think the song sucks, but she's interesting. Matty. right? Is it? Yeah. - That was great. - I... I can do it again. - I can do better. - No no, for a first pass, listen, that was fantastic. Would you like to take a shot at "Danger"? Oh, yeah, I love "Danger." Bless you for that. My God. Where did you find her? The same agency we always go to, man. - The agency sent her? - Yeah, they were pushing her. That's why when she didn't show up, I said, "What's the deal?" Crazy. Ah, if she can only write, we are home free. Come on, Dicky, I mean, you're like a broken record, man. I mean, remember those? Records. You always do this to me, Mike. Look, you've got a contract. Remember signing that little piece of paper that you just had to have? - It has delivery dates, Mike. - Good night, guys. Listen... good night! Get the songs done. Just get the songs done so we can get the music out there to the talent, eh? Okay? I can get out of my mortgage and you get out of debt, all right? - All right. - Okay, then. You got it. Tomorrow! I'll have something for you. - I'll hold you to it, Mike. - Done deal. - Hey, wait up, will you? - Hey. Hi. Um, I just wanted to tell you - I really thought you were dynamite. - Oh, thanks. And I want to thank you for coming in. A lot of people come in the studio and they've either got chops or they think they've got chops, but you... Can I buy you a drink? Uh, I don't drink. - But thank you. - Well... why don't you buy me a drink? taken you to Cabo for that drink, but not any more. Oh, the bad old days! But, no, I'm going... I'm going to my hotel room. I'm gonna take a shower and I'm going to bed. So... We could do that too. - I'm kidding. - Man, all right. I knew... I thought you were, but... - Yeah, I was kidding. - You're leaving me here flatfooted, a little dumbfounded, to be perfectly honest. - No, I'm... - Um... why do you go to a hotel? I thought you lived around here? I do. How do you... One of the guys, he told me that sometimes you stay at a hotel after a night of recording. Yeah, well, that was a holdover from the bad old days. Usually I was too wasted to make it home and so I'd... Now it's just a... I don't know, it's kind of like a comfort thing. It's just nostalgia. And they also have really first-run movies over on the TV system. I really, um, I really want to remember this night, Mike. You know, I really love singing. It's like I get to become a different person. I really feel the music. It's like this surge comes over me. I call it "blue seduction." - It's a good name for a song. I may use that. J' It's like a wave on the ocean J' J' The way you move on me J' J' It's like a wave of emotion J' J' You take me out to sea J' J' Blue seduction J' - J' Seduction J' - All right. Look at that. That was amazing. - Thank you. - You just made that up? Yeah. Sometimes it just comes to me like that. That's crazy. Okay, I'm definitely stealing that. Sorry. We, um... we could try the piano, try the melody. I don't know. Hey, do you mind? Nope, go ahead. So, right ahead. Go ahead. See? It was meant to be. All right!!... How about... Um, something like this? - Mmm... - A little too... Okay, how about something maybe more boring than sleepy? - Eh, no no. I don't know if it's quite there yet. Barb, register 6. Barb, register 6. Got a price check. No? Is that... A little more up... a little more up. Could be like the Dudley Moore collection... J' I can feel an emotion... J' We're almost there. Is that... you want some bottom? You want to take it down? - Yeah, a little bit. - Little bit of ding, badada... - Let's take it down south. - Okay. One... two... one, two, three, four. J' I can feel an emotion... J' - Feeling that, actually. - J' Deep as the sea J' J' Like an ancient ship J' J' On course with destiny J' J' Your lips meet mine J' J' Like a wave kisses the shore J' J' Your eyes deep as the sea J' J' I'm swept away forevermore... J' Don't look now, but the cast of "Twilight" are converging. J' Like a wave on the ocean J' J' The way you move on me J' J' It's a wave of emotion J' J' You take me out to sea J' J' Blue seduction J' J' A seduction J' J' Blue seduction... J' Drinks are on the house. - Thank you. - That's so sweet of you. - Thank you so much. - No problem. You guys sound great. You should make an album together. I'd buy it. Thanks. Is she on the payroll? We play brunch if that's... Well, see, we make a good team. Where did you learn to sing? I have no idea. - You're playing with me. - No, I swear. I just... you know, it just comes from within, from right here. And I'm glad you like it. I do. I think you'll go very far... with it, or whatever you choose to do. Thank you. Thank you. Come from you, you know, that really means a lot. Well, thank you, Matty, for sharing that. And thank you for your work today. That was most impressive. You saved my ass. Um, but I gotta... I gotta go to bed, all right? - Got a big day tomorrow. - Yeah. So thank you, Matty. Well, if you use the song, that would make me somebody nobody knows. - That's a really good... - Great song title! All right. Good night. Thank you, Matty McPherson. - Hello? - Hey. I tried you on your cell. You didn't pick up. I thought you said you were gonna call if you were staying at the hotel tonight. L... I just didn't know, that's all. Yeah, hey, you know, I was just looking for it. It's funny. I was gonna call you, but... I don't know, I think I left it in... I don't know where I left it, actually. But I'll find it. I just wanted to know how the session went. Um, the session went famously, actually. No, it went really really well. It was good. Little worn out, though, so I'm gonna hit the showers, and the sack, I think. But I'll bell you in the morning, first thing. Okay. I'll see you tomorrow then. - All right, babe. - Bye. 'Night. 'Night. You left this underneath the piano bench downstairs. Oh. You know what Freud would say about this. - No, what? - He'd say this. Matty. Matty? Is this where you tell me that you're married and you love your wife? Don't worry. This isn't an affair, it's a one-time thing. So come on in and I'll rub your back. - HEY- - HEY... Sorry. Did I startle you? - Just a little. - I'm sorry. I didn't mean to. Don't... don't stop. That was really nice. - Yeah? - Doesn't sound like you. - What is it? - Just something new I'm messing with. Mmm. What's it called? - "Blue Seduction." - Nice. I like it. Play some more. Okay. Uh, Dicky says we need three more songs. I got about a week. Who'd Dicky get you for the lead vocal? New girl. Never worked with her. Her name is Matty. She's got a real nice vocal quality. Mm-hmm. She attractive? Of course. I gotta show a house. Oh my God, that's awful. What... I... oh. That's worse. Oh, hi, Dicky. Hey, Mike, I just listened to the demo. I gotta tell you, man, it is awesome. We might want to think about producing this girl. Oh, really? She's young, she's gorgeous, vocals are hot. We could make her a star with the right vehicle. That's great. Um, listen, I'm feeling, um... what do you think about getting The Saints back together? Mike? Just... listen, the only... revival bands are the only thing banking any coin right now, you know? And you've got me writing... I'm making music to have your teeth drilled to here, to fulfill some lame... I'm just saying think about it. No, you think about it. All right? Maybe... no, don't think about it. You do it, all right? Hello? It's Matty. Hi. How'd you get my number? Stanley gave it to me. I hope that's okay. Where are you? I'm never far, Mike. I thought you might want a break. Grab a drink? I don't drink. Besides I'm working. I'm working on these songs. And they suck. I can't seem to get my mojo working. Don't say... I won't. I told you I'd give you "Blue Seduction." That means you only need two more songs, and believe it or not, I have tons of ideas. Come on. I won't even want any credit. My wife is already jealous. Good. Jealousy always makes for hot sex. Besides, she'll come around as soon as she sees what a great writing team you and I make. - Yeah, sure she will. - Take down my number. I already got it. It showed up on the phone. All right. I'll call you later. Have a great night, lover. Yeah, you too. "Lover"? Oh, gosh. That's no problem, Mom. We love the place. Okay, we'll pick you up around 8:30. See you then. Bye. Happy birthday, Mom. Happy birthday, Mom. - Mmm. - Ow. Well, she isn't feeling great the past couple of days. - Really? - Yeah. I don't know. I thought that 50 was bad, but 60 is driving her and me absolutely nuts. Right. Um, I think you'll... be on your own tonight at Cozy's. Come on, Mike. It's her damn 60th. I know, babe, but I got a lot of work to do. And I think... I think I should focus on that. I'll see what I can do. Hmm. Oh. They're all after me today. It's Betty. Yeah, Betty? Uh, yeah. Right now? Okay. Okay, yeah, I'll be there in 20 minutes. - Bye. - Big leap. Mm-hmm. - See you later. - Bye. - Bye. - See you... - Yeah. - Okay. Rock and roll. Hey. I am so sorry I'm late. Um, the I-85 was... - Oh, I understand. - ... So so bad. - Uh, I am Matty. - Yeah, I'm Joyce Taylor. Nice to meet you. I am so excited to see this house. Uh, it's just... I've been living downtown and it's just... it's a little dangerous. - I understand. - And it's expensive. And... - Listen, I hope this'll be the perfect... - ... spot for you. - Oh. L... I am so sorry. - Oh, it's okay, take your time. - Uh, it's business. I'll meet you inside whenever you're ready. Hello? Hey. Guess what? I decided to use your song on my album. Oh my gosh. Well, that's great news because that means you get a little treat. I've written a new song for you. Yeah? J' I'm gonna lead you J' J' Into temptation J' J' I'm gonna deliver you... J' - I love it. - J' From love... J' - I love it! Okay, well, I have to go. I'm just... I'm doing something. Um, I'll call you soon, okay? Bye. Bye. Thank you very much. Oh my God. Look at... Bang bang bang. You know what I like. - Okay, that's... honey. - Sorry. You can't sneak up on me when I'm practicing my stadium moves. I know, I'm sorry. - It really just makes me jump. - Okay, so listen: Can you join us for birthday cake tonight? - Yeah. God, of course. - Good. Listen, I'm gonna take my own car and pick up Mom first. - That's a good idea. - You can meet us there. She wants me to come early to help her with some health-insurance paperwork or something... I don't know why it has to be tonight. - Really? - Yeah. - I guess she's feeling her mortality. - Understood. Okay, so meet us there at around 8:30? - Okay, I'm there. - Okay. Great. Bye. - Okay, yeah. - Work hard, Mikey. - Working. Well, hello. - Ow. - Sorry. Get the door. Right. Oh, God... bad knee. What are you doing? Whoa, okay. Um... that's... uh... I always like to wash it down with a little drink. You... um... I can understand, that's... Matty, look, I've been sober for 15 years, okay? - So this... - Come on. - ... Is a little bit... - It's just a little sugar and fire. Sugar and fire. I mean, I don't care what you do. But it's totally cool. I'm hip, but... Look, there's not... no. Mmm! Mmmm! Swallow. No problem. J' I'm going where the air is cleaner J' J' I'm going back to those great friends of mine J' J' I'm going where the folks J' J' Are kind to strangers... J' I shouldn't be eating this crap. I feel dizzy a lot of the times, and sometimes I feel short of breath. Oh, God, Mom, you've got to change physicians. I tell you, call Dr. Steadman. I can't. My HMO doesn't cover him. Listen, Mom, Mike's got a deal. Yeah? Like the publishing deal that pays him 25 bucks a week? No, something different, something big. He's got a record deal. Yeah? With? An independent label. Joycey, I don't believe you. I always know when you're lying. Mom, I'm not lying. Joycey, you two never could look life in the face. Mom, don't worry, okay? It's gonna be different this time. He's gonna do it this time, and we'll all be able to live like we used to. Yeah? Was that so great? - With him cheating on you all the time? - Mom, come on. I don't need this right now. J' Rooooo... J' J' Rose! J' HEY, boys. Ladies and gentlemen, we've got a real rock star here tonight, Mike Taylor. Hi. I'm so sorry I'm late. Happy birthday. Mwah! Mwah! Two for Tuesday. I'll give you one more European style. Here you go. Happy birthday. Found that in my car. - How are you, baby? Good to see you. - Hi. I'm sorry I'm late. It's okay. We already ordered... I'm really late. These are cold. Jeez. Better wash 'em off. Well, damn apples. Look at that thing. You'd think a birthday was on. You're 60? Really? I think that's great, considering... Hi, Mikey. Nice to see you. It's just nice to see, period, when you're... Come on, that is... what? It's a birthday joke. - What? - What are you doing? Hey, Crazy Hey, Ray... So how about our gorgeous birthday girl? Isn't she looking beautiful tonight? She is. You're looking hot in that beige ensemble. Got the beige rage on, don't you? And how's the second most beautiful girl doing in the world? - Hey hey hey. - Oh. Who, me? Oh, great. You know I love coming here almost as much as my mom does. Just can't get enough of your music. - Or your charm. - Thank you very much. The feeling is mutual, I can assure you. So Mike, how's the music going? - Have you got it flowing? - Man, it's flowing like crazy. - Crazy. Thanks for asking. - I'm sure glad to hear that. My feet are itching. Do you know any way we can get 'em scratched? - Sure. Why not? - Let's do it. I'm gonna butt in! You know, he could cut in and she wouldn't even notice. And that is just crazy. Oh, Ray. Think we'll be sweet like that when we hit the big 6-0? God, if we hit the big 6-0. What? Come on, baby? Eat fast, died young, leave a good-looking corpse. J' I'll tell you why J' J' This is the last time J' J' That we'll say goodbye. J' Dicky? Mikey. Well... I got another song for you. So I think we ought to just, you know, record it right away. Get in there. So why don't we just, you know, book the session? You know, 11:00? After 11:00. Great great great. I'll get Matty. No. Why? Why the hell not? She makes your stuff sound new. You need her, Mike. We need all the help we can get. Listen to me very carefully, you prick. You don't like my music, you tell it to my face, all right? I'm sick of your innuendos and your sarcasm when you're dealing with my art. So just go to hell, Dicky. Jesus. Mike. Sorry. Sorry about that. We're... we're on. Guess we'll do it after 11:00 PM... no, we'll stick with it... stick with the time. - All right? Can't wait. - Yeah. - Bye. - Bye, Mike. Why aren't you at your AA meeting? Stanley went instead. I'm really on a roll here. Oh, man, am I beat. Oh, what a day. Ls there anything to eat? Yeah, in the thing. Mike, there's nothing to eat. There's no food in the house. Couldn't you have gone shopping? Gone to the store? I'll go now. Oh, what are you doing? You know that mountain-view house I had? - The one in escrow for over two months? - Yeah. - The damned lender pulled the funding. - What? There's all this crap going on with the frozen... - What? - ... Liquidity in the mortgage market, so now the buyer can't qualify for the loan. - The whole damn deal is off. - What the hell is that? - I don't know. - Where does he get off? - I am so sick of this life! - Yeah, this sucks. Hey, guys- How's it going? I've been working on these songs all night. They're really good, Mike. "These"? How many you got? - Two. - Hey! Wow. "Blue Seduction" and "Temptation." You've been holding out on us, Mike. That's great. He has. They're really great. They're even better than the other songs, if that's even possible. Well, we're all here now. Why don't we record something? Hey, thanks for having me back. I appreciate it more than you'll know. I didn't finish "Temptation." What the hell are you doing here? I thought you'd be happy. I told you, I'm giving you the songs. All right! Let's get cracking. All right, let's see what we got here. Go ahead. J' You say you're afraid of me J' All right. Um... I don't think you're feeling it. Right? 'Cause, um, I don't know. I just don't. So I need you to feel it more. - Sorry. Just give me a minute. - Sure. Take your time. Go. J' You say you're... J' Cut cut. Come on, Matty. Pay attention, would you? I'm sorry, Mike. Okay, here we go. On three... J' You say you're afraid of me J' J' You say you've never felt this way J' J' You say I appeal... J' - J' To your... J' - Um. - I don't know, just go again. - Come on, Mike, she's doing great. Okay, contrary to Stanley's opinion, I don't think you're feeling it 'cause I don't think you're going deep enough. So I need you to go deeper. All right, Matty? Deeper. So let's just go deeper. Okay? Here we go. J' You say you're afraid of me J' J' You say you've never felt this way J' J' You say I appeal J' J' To your dark side J' J' And now you don't care J' J' Even if there's hell to pay J' J' I'm gonna lead you... J' J' In... J' Um... you know the sound that, um... - migrating geese... - Oh, come on, Mike! It's a piece of crap! Sing it yourself. What? All right. Come on, I can't work with this. You're starting to act like the same jerk you were 15 years ago without the excuses. Hey, Mike. Sorry. I tried. What's that supposed to mean? Just what I said. There was no one else available. What the hell's going on here? I wanted another singer. He said he couldn't find one. He said they were all busy. - He's lying. - I know. He loves her. And I thought you were happy with her performance last week anyway. - Yeah, well, I was. - Then what's the problem? I don't get it. You're not supposed to get it, Stanley. You're just supposed to sit there and act employed so the next time some up-and-coming young hopeful wanders in our doors, we don't look like a bunch of washed-up has-beens trying to recreate pop history in a converted dentist's office. - What the hell's wrong with him? - He's loaded, Dicky. - Look, I'm... - Oh. - I thought you were Stanley. - Give me a break. What? You're screwing Stanley too? Come on. I want a career in the music business. A girl's got to do what a girl's got to do. Look... Matty, you got to understand how hard this is for me, okay? L... I've been sober for 15 years. I haven't had a hit record in 20. You turn up, suddenly I'm writing miraculously. But they're not my songs, they're your songs, okay? And you're screwing my brains out like they haven't been in God knows how long. And it's doing my head in, all right? You're driving me insane here. You know what? You're right. You don't deserve to be treated like this. We're through. And I'm okay with that. - You can go now. - Wait. Now... Well, are you going? Come on, you act like a puppy dog. Stop licking your wounds and get your butt in here for one last night-cap before you turn in. Whatever you say. I don't drink. Matty, I'm so sorry about today. Stanley, I believe you know your friend Mike. Are you okay? Yeah. Yeah, I'll be fine. Maybe you should go home though tonight. Mike and I have some catching up to do. Go on. I'll be all right. Stanley. You and Stanley. I'm not buying it. He's buying it. Go home, Mike. Go home and try not to think of me while you're screwing your wife. Go home. Or screw me, Mike. Those are your only choices. I could kill you. Do it. "Thanks, my love, for a wonderful night. You sure know how to party. Here's the new song I wrote for us. It's called 'Living on the Edge. I love you... Mike. Matty-" Oh, God. Oh, that's disgusting. Honey? Honey, I'm home. Baby? Joyce? "Good morning. Hope the session went well. I'm going to be late tonight. Crazy dill... So you'll have to make your own breakfast." Really? Powders be gone. Powders... be gone. Dicky. I'm freezing. You look like something the dog found in the garbage. That's easy for you to say. - I'm worried about you. - Yeah? Well, I'm fine. Matter of fact, I've got another song for you. Man, that was quick. Well, Matty's working me... for me... with me. - Matty? - Yeah. Oh. I'm finally starting to get it. Mike, as much as I need these songs, it's not worth you backsliding into your old ways again. I can handle it, all right? Look, Matty's a terrific singer, but otherwise, she's just a diversion. You know that. I think I've got it under control. So, thanks. You are a married man going around sniffing up the skirt of a 20-something-year-old, while Joyce, the one who stuck with you through all the girls, booze and rehab... - she plays the unsuspecting wife. - Yeah. You're playing with dynamite here, Mike. Without Joyce, you'd have been dead years ago. Yeah. - Then you gotta let it go. - Okay. - Okay? - Yeah. Matty can't be yours. She just can't be. - Okay. - So snap out of it. Fine fine, but you're gonna have to leave now. - We gotta finish this project. - You've got work to do. Mike, I have had it with you, buddy! Mikey? - Hmm? Oh, Joyce. - Hi, baby. - Hey. Hey. Oh, no, you know... - Oh, baby, not now. - Come on. - Let's see... - Sorry, honey. - I can't. - Oh. I didn't know, baby. Why am I not enough for you, huh? I can't do this. Oh, yes, you can. - Can't you love this body? - I... - I can, sure. - Touch me. - L... oh, boobies. - Touch me. Mikey? Oh. I feel sorry for you, Mikey. I really do. Joyce? Joyce? Hello? Hey, Joyce. No, I have not been drinking. Because I know whether I've been drinking. What... look, I'm working, babe. Okay? So... All right, now there's some... honey, there's somebody at the door. I gotta go. I'll call you in a bit, all right? All right? Have a nice day. Bye. - Oh, hi. - Aren't you gonna invite me in? Um, I would, but I just think it's a mistake right now... here. - Please? I brought you something. - Exact... Honey, that coke... I can't do that stuff any more. L... I went and recorded it with Dicky and Stanley. They're... they're great. You're really gonna like it. They're our songs... the ones that we wrote together. Please? I think you're just... you're gonna love listening to them. So the other crazy thing about Puccini... is that he's like this... like a mathematician. Like, he could break your heart in three notes. - Who's the old lady? - So... I already... She... that's my, uh, wife. I like her face. She has kind eyes. Yeah, she does. And she... she is kind. She looks... What does she do? - Uh, real estate. - Oh. That's cool... real estate. But does she understand you? I mean, she's not an artist. She's totally artistic, I mean, in her own way. But she's, like, completely supportive. She's one of our biggest fans... biggest fan in a sense. Uh, I wouldn't technically call her a groupie, but she would come to all the gigs and she'd be backstage. It's been... I mean, thank God we actually met, 'cause, you know, she totally saved my life from this stuff. Yeah. Do you want to listen to the song? I mean, I was clinically dead, you know, for, like, two minutes. And she pulled some "Baywatch" CPR... - Can we listen to our song now? - They're your songs, okay? Come on, really. Come on, no. Matty! At least leave the CD. Matty? You coming back? Honey, you okay? I mean, when are you coming back? Listen, I've got some bad news. Mom's had a stroke. She's here at the hospital. - I've got to stay with her. - Wait a minute. No, wait. You're kidding me. Honey, that's terrible. Um, you want me to come over? No. No, you better not. They only let one person in the room with her anyway. All right, call me if you need anything, all right? I'll be right there. - Bye. - Bye. Whoa. Hey, this is Matty. Leave your name and number and I'll get right back to you. Matty, uh, it's me. Listen, Joyce is... she's doing something tonight with her mom. And so I'm free. I'm alone here. If you want to come by... come on back, bring that CD or whatever else you want to bring over and we can write, hang out. I feel... feeling really productive. So, yeah, come on by. Or I'll come over there. Whatever. All right. Call me if it's in the flow. "In the flow"? Smooth. Just pretend that I'm Joyce. Matty, hi. How did you get in here? What's... - How does she do it? - Huh? - Like this? - No, not really. That's... oh, that's pretty good. - Yeah. - All right, like this. We're doing this now, aren't we? - Oh, yeah? - Yeah. - You seem a little sluggish. - I do? I mean, considering I just woke up, I thought I was doing pretty... - Why don't you take this? - Okay. - Yeah. - All right. Ahh, come on! Um, all right, hold. I'm having... a little panic attack. No no, you've got to get off me! I'm having... sorry. I'm having trouble breathing. I'm not jealous of Joyce, you know. What did you give me? What is that? L... I gave you three songs. I gave you "Blue Seduction," I gave you "Temptation," and I gave you "Living on the Edge," which you seem to be doing pretty well right now. I can write my own material. I want to write my own songs, if you'll just leave me alone. Bravo. Blame it on me, the one person you do not want to get rid of, because I fit into all of your addictions. - What are you talking- - The booze... - Come on. - ...the sex... - What? - ...the drugs, the rage... The what? Just get out, would you? What do you want from me? I can sing. I can write. I can love you better than anyone. You need me! Not any more! Get out! Out! Good night! Had a real good time! Thank you. Okay. Oh, no. Okay! Ow! No, that's not... Okay. That's very funny. J' In the heat of the heart of the night J' J' There's a hunter J' J' And it makes me wonder J' J' When you hold out my hand J' J' I'm the man with a plan J' J' And I'm... J' Sucks. Boy oh boy. J' When there's deep... J' Oh, man. Okay. Look, I said leave me alone, you stupid bitch! - How many... - Mike? I do not deserve that. I've been up all night with my dying mother worried sick. And what the hell have you been doing that you can't be disturbed? I'm sorry, baby. I was really sorry. I was writing. I got kind of caught up in... the character of the song. And I didn't know that was you, babe. I'm sorry. How's Mom? She's out of intensive care. They've given her a sedative to help her sleep through the night. - What'd they give her? I mean, does... never mind. Good. Listen, why don't we go to Cozy's and unwind? I think we could both stand a relaxing evening together... reconnect. Forget your lousy music for one night. I would love to go to Cozy's. And I love you. And I don't want to lose you. Me too. - Come on, honey. - I'm coming this way. You're going around that way. All right, all right. J' You're in trouble, baby... J' J' No matter where you're going J' J' No matter where you've been. J' All right. That was great, guys. - Thank you very much. - That was wonderful. Look, I'm so sorry to hear about your mom. Oh, yeah. Thanks, Ray. It's been a little rough. But we're hoping she'll pull through. Your friend came by the other night. My friend? Oh, my client. How was she? Was she any good? She was great! In fact, we're going to ask her to sing a few songs tonight. - Oh, good. - You're gonna like this gal. She's gonna need some help getting her stuff out there. Oh, yeah? Really? Yeah. You know, you might be able to give her a hand up. All righty, I'll keep that in mind. Who's your friend? I've been showing her houses for the last week. She's a songwriter. - Oh, really? - I know. I'm sorry. She just... she's a big fan of yours. And when she found out that I was married to you, she couldn't wait to meet you. She kind of went crazy. She can audition for you. She's a very nice girl, Mike. - Just give her a chance. - What's her name? Ladies and gentlemen, Matty McPherson. Thanks, guys. I want to say thank you to Crazy and Ray, and a special thanks to Joyce for giving me this opportunity to sing here tonight. This is a song I wrote for a special someone. It's called "Temptation." J' You say you're afraid of me J' J' You say you've never felt this way J' J' You say I appeal J' J' To your dark side J' J' And now you don't care J' J' Even if there's hell to pay J' J' I'm gonna lead you J' J' Into temptation J' J' And deliver you from love J' J' I'm gonna lead you J' J' Into temptation J' J' And deliver you from love. J' Isn't she something? Wow. She's great. She's a really good songwriter. And work on some songs? Make it easier for you, come up with some new stuff. - Joyce? - What do you think? - Listen. - What? I've got a... Mikey, what? Say it. It's nothing. All right? It's nothing. Forget about it. - HEY- - HEY... That was great. Very impressive. - Thank you very much. - Hey. Oh, Matty, this is my husband Mike. Oh, well, I'd recognize him anywhere. - Thanks so much for coming tonight. - No, great set. - Here, pull up a seat. - Oh. Well, thanks. Oh, Matty, I meant to tell you, they dropped the price on the house you like. Oh my God, I love that house. Thank you so much. You have an amazing wife, Mikey. Can I call you Mikey? We have so much in common... the same taste in everything. - Did you like the song, Mikey? - Yeah, a lot. It was really... from what I heard, it was interesting. It sounds a little like something I'm working on, but it was... very impressive. Well, I've just recently recorded the song. And it's copywritten, so I hope we don't start off with a copyright problem! That's funny, Mike, because I don't recall hearing you play anything like that. You know what? You're right. I could... I could hear it again, if you both... Right now I'm gonna... Be right back. A shot, straight up. You are making an ass of yourself. What about you? Kissing up to Miss Wannabe over there. - Come on. - What, are you jealous of her talent? No. Are you jealous of her beauty? I'll be at the hospital with my mother. All right. I'll be right here with my bottle. What the heck was that all about? Oh, sweetheart, you should know. You orchestrated it. You know, I could have anyone in this bar, but I want you. That is not saying much. I mean, have you seen this place? Taste me, darling. Yeah, that's a good boy. No. Stop. Jo... Joyce. - You're home. - Yeah, I'm home, baby. Oh, Joyce. I've got to talk to you. - I gotta talk to you about me and Matty. - Shh. Don't worry. Man, I'm feeling so sleepy. That's because I gave you a sedative - to help you relax. - Thank you. Joyce, I'm sorry. I'm so sorry for everything. You don't have to be sorry. Just tell me you love me. I love you. You have some constitution there, sailor. I thought your heart would have exploded by now. What... why are my pants down? Have you ever had sex while being tied up? - Yeah... - Mikey? Come on, is that what we're doing? - Don't worry, baby. - What are we doing? Come on now. You know, I think it's about time we called Stanley. Yeah? Why? Well, I was thinking about You think that's over the top? No, I think it's very reasonable. I'll give you 100 grand if you pull up my pants and untie me. Yeah. The problem with that is - you don't have 100 grand. - No. - You know why? - Why? Because you're broke. And you're a loser. Well, that's a little harsh... maybe true, but I'll tell you what: You untie me, I'll use your songs and we can negotiate, because this is... Come on, this is... it hurts. Can you take me out of here? Don't treat me like one of your groupies. Okay, yeah. You're... I'll treat you like you're crazy then. - You know what I find amazing? - What? Is that I put all that crap in your drink, and you still keep going. You're like a bull elephant. What is this? Get off me, honey. What are you... what are you trying to do? - What is that? - Here we go. - What are you trying to do? - Kill you. What? No... God! I'm looking for Jan Stevens's room. She's in 254 West, that way. - Sir, please don't run in my halls. - Oh, man. Wait a minute, that's 2... Just... Sir. Sir, you left so quickly. Jan Stevens went home this morning. - She went home to her daughter. - Her daughter? Thank you. Listen, I'm gonna run, okay? 'Cause you ran, I saw you. Uh, hand sanitizer? Down on the corner. Honey! Listen. - You're in danger. - What the hell are you doing here? Baby, listen to me. Okay, I'm sorry. All right? I'm sorry for everything. I didn't mean to hurt you, baby. Oh, really? Which time, Mikey. Then or now? Honey, you are my Gibraltar. And I know that. - You are my rock. - I have heard this before, Mikey. It's the same thing every single time. Me first... Mikey Taylor... but when things start to get a little rough... "Oh, please, Joyce! Please help me!" What the hell do you want? Matty is crazy and she's trying to kill me, okay? - You... she... - Oh, come on! She's blackmailing us and she's trying to kill me. What motive would she have for killing you? She's obsessed with me. Please. What? Lock the doors, all right? I'm gonna take care of this. I'm going to the cops. Shut up! What can I do for you? Missing person? No. My name is Mike Taylor. That's Matty McPherson. Uh, she broke into my house, forced me to have sex with her; She blackmailed me and threatened to kill me. You expect to lay rape charges against her? - Yeah. - That's a new one. Yeah. Breaking and entering? You heard of that? Forcible entry, was it? You're being funny, right? That's a joke? Sir, was it forcible entry? No, okay? She drove me home, okay? I was intoxicated so she drove me home. Thank goodness for that. I don't think you're following me... You see, it only works if she broke your window or she picked your lock. - It doesn't qualify if you let her in. - I understand... the principles of breaking and entering. But that's not really what I'm talking about here, okay? - Okay... - No, please. Let's just say that we're already in the house, okay? However we got in, we're in the house, so... at which point... - Mr. Taylor? - ... The suspect... please! She threatens me, okay? For what it's worth, if a girl like that takes the stand, you better hope that every jury member is a very matronly woman. Thank you so much for that observation, Officer. Well, just in case something happens to you, I'm gonna put her picture right over here so I don't forget what the suspect looks like. Hey, Eddie? Call the squadron on this one. - We got a new rapist. Look over here. - Oh, man. She ties you up and she makes you have sex with her. Okay, you're making a joke at my expense. I come in with a formal complaint and you're making a joke. What makes you think she's not dangerous? 'Cause she's beautiful? - Mr. Taylor... - Is that it? That is some real twisted reverse discrimination you've got going there. Give me her address and I'll have Officer Eddie - go out and interview her - That's the first... - Thank you. - You're very welcome, sir. At least now she'll know there is a formal complaint, and in case something does happen to me... - Absolutely. - ... A citizen... I'm a citizen, all right? - Thank you, Mr. Taylor. - No, thank you. Matty McPherson? Yeah. I need to ask you a few questions. Sure. Come on in. Do you know a Mike Taylor? Sure. Everybody knows Mikey Taylor from The Saints. You're kidding? That was him? Jeez, I didn't recognize him. Nobody does since he became a sexaholic, drugaholic, alcoholic wannabe comeback. I have to ask: Did you have sex with him? I recorded some demos with him. He came over. I let him in. He forced me down. Why didn't you call the police? I was too embarrassed. His friend Stanley came over, and I wouldn't even tell him. It's just... let's leave it at that, unless I'm pregnant- which I could be. And then who would want me? A girl like me, all alone? Who wants damaged goods? Well, I have to tell you, Mr. Taylor is claiming you raped him. Wha... what? You see him and you see me. Who do you think is the bigger, stronger rapist? All right. Did you threaten to kill his wife? You mean his estranged wife Joyce? The one who keeps taking him back to rehab? Okay. Excuse me. This is Officer 212. I'm with Matty McPherson, who claims Mike Taylor raped her. You'd better keep an eye on the house. Roger that. Do you want to press charges? Come down to the station? Maybe, um... maybe just a restraining order, in case he tries again? Sure, I can do that for you. Now I can get you a temporary one tonight, but tomorrow you have to go before the judge. I can write the address down for you. Here you go. Is 200' okay? - Yeah. - Okay. Uh, thanks, Officer Eddie. I saw your tag. Thanks for you help. Okay. No offense, Mike, but I just think we should use her music anyway. Just pay her off... not 100 grand- and cut her loose. But we need her music. Yeah. We'll record the last song. You don't even have to be there. Take a break, man. Go home to Joyce, rehab... whatever you gotta do. Can't... can't you see... I just can't stand this girl-child-woman making money off of me, taking credit. All right? She wrote 'em, but Jesus... She's doing everything in her power to make my life hell. Sorry, Mike, about everything. But the due date's tomorrow, man, so please let us finish the song with Matty tonight. What choice do I have? Sign here, man, and we'll cut her a check. That's a very nice pen, Stanley. - Hello? Yeah? - Mr. Taylor? Officer Eddie just interviewed Matty McPherson. She claims it was you who forced your way into her place and raped her. All right, hold on. Just wait a minute. Okay, now come on... Sir, I have to place you on notice that a restraining order has been issued to her, and you are to remain 200' away from her or you can be arrested. Is that clear, sir? That is perfectly clear, Officer. Thank you for... it's just... She's put a restraining order on me! Okay, deal off! You hear? - Hey hey hey, Mike... - Screw you! Screw the both of you. Mike Taylor? You're warned to stay at least 200' from Miss McPherson. That is 200'... 250'. - Sir, I have to take you in. - Just... - Hands on the hood. - On the hood? You're making me scratch your car. Hey, who's going to move my car... that's a classic. - I need you to look out for that thing. - Don't worry about it. All right, I'm not worried, but my keys are on your hood. - You gonna grab... thank you. - You're welcome. - Listen... - You're a glutton for punishment. I know. I'm sorry. Listen, Stanley, who arranged for Matty to be at the session? You gotta think now. Who took the booking from you? Who call... who... Now look, they called me about billing, then mentioned booking. - All right. Now they called you? - Yes. Do you remember a name of the person who called... No. They had one girl available, so I booked her. You... - One girl? - Yes. Hi. Mom's gone. Everything all right? J' Living on the edge J' J' Of life J' J' Living on the edge J' J' Of life... J' I've got an open house today so I'll be gone all day long, but I should be back in time for supper. And then I can make you something nice. I just gotta stay busy, stay focused, think about the things that I need to get done. - I can't believe that she's gone. - Baby. Baby, I feel so guilty. I should have taken better care of her. You can't blame yourself. Okay, that's... Now you lean on me, all right? It's all gonna be all right. Honey, you've helped me so much through the past. Now it's my time to give back. I tell you, it's all gonna be so much better... I feel it. Don't you... don't you feel like everything's changing for the better? All we gotta do is... is just stick together. Like we always have, we've just got to stick together... Thank you, baby. Thank you. Thank you. Joyce, guess what? L... I just wrote a good song. All right, another good song, but it... the words and the music... they flowed simultaneously. It's like... I don't know. I guess the slump is over or something like that. But it rocks, you know? It genuinely rocks. And I'm gonna take you out to dinner. I want to celebrate. That sounds great. I've got a showing, though. The couple can't see the house till 9:00. That's fine. We'll make it a late dinner. It'll be just like old times. I'll pick you up. Text me the address. But I'm on a roll, baby, okay? I'll probably have another one before I get there. "Before I Get There"... that's another good title for a song. - Bye. - Uh, bye. Joyce? Honey? - Hey. - Hey, I've got your wife. It's like deja vu, except for she's the one who's drugged and tied up. But you know what? I don't really feel like having sex with her. Matty, you don't touch her, you understand me? You sick bitch. Where are you? Oh, Joyce, are those ropes hurting you, honey? No! You listen to me. Listen to me: Don't... you lay one hand on her, so help me God... where are you? You know, if you feel like coming on out to play, you might as well just come over. We could have a menage a trois. Or you could just wait till I slit her throat. Joyce? Joyce? Joyce? You're easy to trick but you're very hard to kill. - Where's Joyce? - Some people call it working. Someone has to pay for your pointless existence. Joyce? Joycey? Ahh! Oh, my knee! Oh. Why are you doing this? You're a singer. Killer. The singing was just for research. Pretty good, though, wasn't I? This is my real racket. Joyce? Oh, thank goodness. Joyce, please help me. It was supposed to be a heart attack. Self-defense is so messy. I'm sorry. Joyce, I'm so sorry. I'm sorry for everything. I'm... I didn't... Oh. I didn't want it to be like this. Why? The insurance, asshole. Oh, God, this sucks. Goodbyes never die. Joyce. Ahhh! I bet your crappy music will sell now! All right. All right, all right. It's okay. There's insurance money; There's the sale of the house; There's the royalties from "Flash in the Pan," okay? You're good. It's my turn. Yeah. Do it. Ahhh! I came here because I thought that Mike was cheating on me with Matty. We had words. We had a big fight. I told him that I wanted a divorce and he... he'd been drinking and he hit me in the face. And then he kicked her. He kicked her and I tried to stop him, but he was too big. - He told me that he'd kill me - before he'd give me a divorce. - He went to the kitchen and he grabbed a knife and he tried to slit her throat, but then... oh! But then I hit him and I tried to stop him... - And he dropped the knife. - He dropped the knife. And then he jumped at her and I knew he was going to kill her. - So she grabbed the knife. - And then I stabbed him. I stabbed him but he wouldn't go down. - He was going to strangle me. - So I stabbed him again. - A couple of times. - Yeah, but then he finally went down. And... is he dead? Oh God, I should go with him. - Me too. - All right, go ahead. I'm sorry. He's gone. Set her down, John. We lost him. Joycey! J' You could be a TV evangelist J' J' You can come real soon after we make love J' J' Or add to your list J' J' You can make history or you can be totally obscure J' J' You can be a vital statistic J' J' Or you can find a cure J' J' But ain't none of us J' J' Not even one of us J' J' Ain't none of us J' J' Getting out of here alive J' J' Alive J' J' You can live in the past J' J' Or you can live in LA J' J' You can live in the moment J' J' Or you can see a shrink every day J' J' You can tell the truth if you know it J' J' Or you can lie through your teeth J' J' You can mock the mere idea of love...
