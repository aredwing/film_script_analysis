It has long been my dream to find the perfect way for people to achieve simply... happiness, contentment, inner peace. These seem to be things that strangely elude us all, but it doesn't have to be that way. We at Arboria have found a path to achieve them. Here at the Institute, we are in the forefront worldwide in neuro-psychology and new therapeutic technologies. Dr. Barry Nyle, our head of research, myself, and our dedicated team of herbalists, naturopaths, and healers have found a way to make that dream a reality. Through our unique blend of benign pharmacology, sensory therapy, and energy sculpting, we can guide you gently along the path to a new, better, happier you, all in the comfortable surroundings of our state-of-the-art facility and our award-winning gardens. We invite you to join us... and find out for your... self. Warm her up. Special 1-1-8-3. Hello, Elena. How are you today? How are you feeling? Have you had... any headaches? You can tell me. Your readings are relatively stable. Very good. That's very, very good. You know, this is always the highlight of my day. Rosemary. Rosemary. Barry! I didn't hear you come in. Been sleeping long? No... I wasn't sleeping. I was... meditating. Oh, you were meditating, yeah. Is everything okay? Everything's fine. If you're hungry, there's some brown rice and steamed asparagus in the refrigerator. That sounds really good. No, I'm not hungry... thank you. Okay. It's been a long day. So... I'm... just going to hit the hay early. Okay. Good night, Barry. Good night, Rosemary. Night Mode. Rest peacefully and reflect. I am so sorry that you were never able to meet your mother. She was a very beautiful woman. She was a very desirable woman. Would you... would you like to have a photo of her? Would you like that? Because you may just find one in your room. You know, you are looking more and more like your mother every day. You look tired today. It's easy to become disillusioned when you don't know who you are... or what you are. I know who I am. That's what gives me my confidence... and my power. And I know who you are, too, Elena. I can guide you towards that achievement... to find your inner strength and your inner power. We all have other forms... and your inner self... needs another to complete it. I... can help you do that. You just... Have to let me... in. I... want... to see... my... father. Please. Oh, Elena. Elena, Elena, Elena. Elena, you know you can't. You're a very sick girl, Elena. You're not well. This... world... is in chaos, Elena. These are... times of great uncertainty and terrible danger. And you are not ready. You're just not well. Don't worry, Elena, you'll see him again one day. I promise. Piece of shit. What? Rosemary. Yeah. We do have a system in place. Yes, a comprehensive list has been compiled. I see. That's fine. Rosemary, why don't you answer the fucking phone? Margo. Yes, Dr. Nyle? It's come to my... attention, Margo... Yes, Dr. Nyle? It's come to my attention that... Elena may be hiding... an illicit object from us. Oh, really? So... Keep your eyes peeled. - Yes, Dr. Nyle, I certainly will. - Good. - Very good. - Dr. Nyle? Yeah. How do you think she would have come into possession of the object? I don't know, Margo. I don't know. But I'm looking into it. Day Mode. Every sunrise brings a new tomorrow. Good morning. Hope you're hungry. Looks better than usual today. What have you got there, a special picture? Let me see. Oh, come on, I'm just curious. That wasn't so hard, now, was it? Who is this? Is it your mother? Where is she? Did she die? Good. Enjoy your dinner. Stop. Please stop. Mercurio. Are you awake? Dr. Arboria. Barry? Barry, is that you, my friend? Yes, Dr. Arboria, it's me. Wonderful. Come closer so I can see you. It's wonderful to see you again. You're looking well, my friend. Thank you, Dr. Arboria. So are you. Oh, Barry, there's... no need to flatter an old man. I know I've... seen better days. Besides... the trappings of the mortal world are... but a distraction, wouldn't you say? Of course, Dr. Arboria. Yes. What really matters... the part of ourselves we must nurture the most... is here. I couldn't agree more. Would you mind... assisting me? Of course, Dr. Arboria. Aren't these videos of the nature... beautiful, Barry? They make me remember a simpler time. Yes, Dr. Arboria. Me too. You are about to embark on a great journey. Are you ready, my friend? I am ready. Good luck. Thank you. Bring home the mother lode, Barry. Your mother's reabsorption into the cycle of life won't be for nothing, my darling Elena. You will be the dawning of a new era for the human race and the human soul. Let the new age of enlightenment begin. No, Barry. I don't like to see the... on my arm. Of course. How is my darling Elena? Well, Dr. Arboria. She's very well. That's wonderful. Thank you. Are you ready? Yes, yes. That's wonderful, Barry. Yes. That's so... wonderful. Isn't it... beautiful? Yes. It is. The dormant volcano... Haleakala Crater. Mark Twain described sunrise here as "the sublimest spectacle I have ever witnessed." To the west of Maui lies Molokai. Except for a few beautiful resort hotels, the modern world has touched Molokai less than any of the other vacation islands. Aloha means welcome. It also means love... and all too soon... Farewell. ...rocket launchers, while the Soviets have produced more than 13,000, a staggering 14-to-1 ratio. They didn't stop when their forces exceeded all requirements of a legitimate defensive capability, and they haven't stopped now. But today they're building weapons as sophisticated and modern as our own. As the Soviets have increased their military power, they've been emboldened to extend that power. They're spreading their military influence in ways that can directly challenge our vital interests and those of our allies. The following aerial photographs, most of them secret until now, illustrate this point in a crucial area very close to home... The Devil's Teardrop. Barry? Barry! Barry, you startled me. I thought you were an intruder. What are you doing? Barry, you're not wearing your appliances. I don't want to wear them anymore. But... It's just you haven't let me see you... without them in a long time. Where did you get that outfit? Has something happened? Sometimes... Sometimes I... I forget... how hard it is for you. I'm sorry. I... I... I should have been there for you more. Barry? Are you okay? I... I'm not... I'm... I'm not... I'm not okay. I went to another world, Rosemary. I see what others cannot see. Please. I looked into the eye of the god. It looked right back through me. It looked through everything. Rosemary, it was so, so, so beautiful. Like a black rainbow... and it chose me. It chose to reveal itself to me. You're nothing. You're less than nothing. Just... spit in the wind. Let go of me. I'm not going to let you go. I'm going to set you free. Elena... Elena? Elena? Elena? You are doing so good. Julie comes walking up, and... like, I can tell just by looking at her she totally, fuckin', - she totally wants to pork me. - Oh, you're so full of shit. What would she want with that two-inch little blood bat? Fuck, my left ball hurts a little. I gotta take a leak. Thanks for telling me. Get bent, you fat fuck! What the fuck? Where is she? I don't know. I don't know. I don't... I don't know. I don't know. You fucked her. No, I... No... No, I didn't. No, I didn't fuck... You fucked her. No, I didn't! I didn't. - You fucked her. - No... No! - You fucked her. - No, no! Shut up! You look so beautiful when you sleep. Sweet, sweet Elena. Well, I found you. It's okay. Come to me, okay? Elena, come on. Come here. Come on. Elena, come to me. Elena? Elena. Come to me. Come. Come to me. Come to me! Do you read? Do you read?
