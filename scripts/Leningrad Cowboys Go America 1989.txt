Pekka practised outside last night. In the morning there was nothing we could do about it. I see. Frozen stiff. And you want to collect the reward. Yes. We need to go to America. Grandfather went there as well. Since then, nowbody has heard from him again. I pay you the fare. Take the stiff one with you and show him the world. Get lost! A few words before we leave. In America only American bands are allowed to play. From now on, you're one. In America everybody speaks English. You too. Those of you who don't speak it, better learn it soon. I don't want to speak English. The success has gone to Vladimir's head. Without us... Shut up! Spinglish. I mean, speak English.
