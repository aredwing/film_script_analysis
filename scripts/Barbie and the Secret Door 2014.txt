No problem. How can I help you? The Equestrian Club has asked if you might say a few words... ...before their exhibition this afternoon. You mean, a speech? Not just for the horses, I'm guessing. I believe the two-legged members of the club... ...will be there as well, Your Highness. Of course. Brookhurst, please thank them for the invitation, but-- But you send your regrets. Of course, Your Highness Speech? I can't do that. All I really wanna do ls stay right here Away from prying eyes 'Cause I really gotta get To chapter three And see if I'm surprised Will the princess slay the dragon? Will she save the day? Will she find a brand-new world That takes her breath away? What's gonna happen? I can't wait to see What's gonna happen? It's all a mystery I need to turn the page Prepare to be amazed See if she's got it made It's nothing I'd expect What's gonna happen next? Princess Alexa. The prince of Hilgovia has arrived for tea. Your grandmother says she would be very pleased if you would join them. All I really wanna do ls hide right here And start on chapter four Maybe this is where the princess Saves her friends And claims her just reward Will she shoot a perfect arrow? Will her aim be true? Will she meet a mighty foe And know just what to do? What's gonna happen? I can't wait to see What's gonna happen? It's all a mystery I need to turn the page Prepare to be amazed See if she's got it made Whoa-whoa-oh-oh It's nothing I'd expect What's gonna happen next? Alexa. Uh, hello, Mother. The dance instructor is waiting, and so are your friends. Oh, Well No more excuses. The ball is tonight. You must finally learn to dance like a princess. Come now. Yes, Mother. Five, six, seven, eight. Ah, girls. Girls, please. We are here to practise the art of the dance... ...not that hippity-hop. - Yes, Mr. Primrose. - Yes, Mr. Primrose. Sorry I'm late, Mr. Primrose. Ah, Princess Alexa. How delightful of you to join us. Let's pick up where we left off last lesson, shall we? Hey, guys. - Hey, Alexa. - Hey, Alexa. The young ladies-in-waiting stand here, um, waiting. And then your father, the king, bows to you, the princess. The orchestra begins. And one, two, three, one, two, three. Eyes up, Your Highness. Um, Mr. Primrose, this really isn't my thing. Nonsense, Your Highness. Just glide. Two, three, glide, two, three You're very patient, but I'm afraid I'm not No, no, you're doing exceedingly well, Your Highness. - I wish I could, but I'm not very - Just concentrate. - One, two... Oh! - Oh! - Whoa! - Aah! I'm so sorry. Oh, dear, Mr. Primrose. Ah, yes, well, that's a bit, aah, tender. I'm so sorry. Are you okay? Mother, I've tried to learn the dance, but I just can't. I'd better just sit this one out. Nonsense. It's tradition. Every royal ball for the last 150 One hundred and sixty. Sixty years has begun with this waltz. And now that you're 17, it's your turn to carry on the tradition. But Everybody will be watching me. That is the general idea, Alexa. After all, you are the princess. Um, Your Majesty? I could do the waltz at the ball instead of Alexa. That's a great idea. Thank you, Jenna. But Princess Alexa must be the one to dance. Worth a try. If you don't mind, Your Highness... ...I think I'd better see to my ankle. Brookhurst, help me with Mr. Primrose, please? Aah, I can never remember. Is it heat and then ice? Oh! Jenna, Samantha, please... ...show Alexa how to do the dance, would you? - Yes, Your Highness. - Yes, Your Highness. Sorry you guys have to do this. Are you kidding? It means getting to wear an amazing dress tonight. Wait a sec. She didn't say which dance, did she? Remember this? Heh. Come on, Alexa. Ugh, I don't know. I can't dance like you guys. Try it. Like we showed you last time. - Five, six, seven, eight. - Five, six, seven, eight. Ugh. Sorry. I can't keep up with you. You were doing great. I'm having enough trouble learning the waltz. Alexa, you're a princess. Which means you're good at everything. So everyone keeps telling me. Don't worry. You'll do great tonight. We'll see. Thanks, guys. I'll see you around, okay? - Bye, Alexa. - Bye, Alexa. Bye. I thought you danced beautifully. You have to say that. You're my grandmother. You shouldn't hide your talents, dear. What are you afraid of? Other than an epic fail in front of everyone? I do wish you had come to tea. The prince of Hilgovia is very nice. And he's your age. Grandma, you know I don't like that stuff. Meeting people, giving speeches, going to balls. All those horrible things princesses are forced to do. - Grandma. - Princess or not... ...you can't hide from life forever, dear. You'll never know what you can do unless you try. Here. I brought this down for you. But I've read all your books, Grandma. Not this one. I've been saving this for the right time. "In a kingdom by the sea lived a princess... ...who had magical powers." Ah, but you probably won't like it. Oh, uh, Grandma. Thanks. You know exactly what I like. "The princess could have made flowers bloom... ...or changed the colour of her dress. But you can't use magic you don't know you have." "There in wall of her garden was a door she had never noticed before. A door that led to a fantastic world that she would never forget. And then, with the flick of a wand, she discovered she had magic." Ah. How cool would that be if I had magic? My bed would make itself New books on every shelf And then I'd cast a spell Abracadabra My pets would talk to me And then we'd all have tea Create a pair of shoes That would know all the moves I'd always find the groove Feel the beat now And with the spotlight on I'd twirl perfectly If I had magic Magic, magic If I had magic Magic, magic I'd make a chocolate lake Turn cabbage into cake I'd text without mistakes LOL, yeah I'd dream a pair of wings And I would fly away I'd zoom across the sky Make it snow in July I wouldn't be so shy Pleased to meet you I'd do just what I want Like every single day Hey If I had magic Magic, magic If I had magic Magic, magic And I could do anything Suddenly I would be Everything that I dreamed I could be If I had magic Magic, magic If I had magic Magic, magic If I had magic Magic, magic Magic, magic If I had magic Your Highness! Good news. Mr. Primrose is recovering. You may continue the dance lesson. Princess Alexa! Intruder. Dive! I mean halt. Hey We know you're there. You might as well swim out. Swim? I mean, walk out. Just show yourself. Whoa! Legs. You there, come out. Who are you and...? A tiara? Wait. Are you a princess? I'm Princess Alexa. Ah! Your Highness. Your Princessness. What are you doing? Um, I'm bowing. I'm sorry. Maybe I should just go back the way I came and - Unh. - No, stay. You can help us. She can help us. What are you talking about? Help with what? Well... It wasn't very long ago Malucia came She took my wings away All of my magic was gone That was my darkest day But now My luck's gonna change 'Cause you're here You're here All of our problems disappear Pretty soon I'm gonna have my wings This is solving everything And it makes me wanna sing Because you're here You're here And I'm ashamed to say Malucia came And she took my tail away No more swimming for me That was my darkest day. But now My luck's gonna change 'Cause you're here You're here All of our problems disappear Now I know my tail is coming back And my leg will be on track And I know it for a fact Because you're here You're here You're here You're here Hey Hey, hey Hey Hey, hey, hey - Because you're here -You're here - You're here -You're here All of our problems disappear - This is solving everything -I got my tail I got my wings And it makes us wanna sing Because you're here Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na You're here - You're here -Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na - You're here -Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na You're here Mermaids. Oops. Heh, still getting used to my new centre of gravity. Heh. Your Highness. You're the only one who can help us. Look, I'm very sorry to hear about this Malucia. And what she did to you, but I can't help anyone. Well, heh, sure you can. With your magic. I hate to disappoint you... ...but I don't have any magic. I'm sorry. It's this pure oxygen you land folks breathe. Heh. Making me dizzy. Where were we? The princess was informing us that she doesn't have any magic. So you don't know about the wand in your hair? Wand? I have no idea where this came from. Or the gown. How else does a princess dress? Well, for hanging out around the castle, I usually wear something like... How can I describe it? It's sort of like Are you okay? What? Ha, ha. Whoa. Did I just do that? - Ugh. Yellow? - Let's see if I can change it back. Maybe if I... Uh, hang on, heh, I'll get it. If I hold it like this or like this? Or like this? Wait. Sniffers. Ah! Oh, no. Malucia's minions. They'll smell your magic. Dive. Romy, you get the princess to the grove... ...and I'll throw them off the scent. No time. I'll get the princess to the grove and you throw them off the scent. Come on, Alexa. Legs. All right then, Sniffers. Sniff this. Here you go. - What's this? - Shh. Hold tight. Stop. What part of stop do you not understand, Whiff? I thought I smelled some magic. Ugh. Stenchweed. Well, yeah, Sniff. I could have smelled that with my nose tied behind my back. Wait, wait, wait. But on the high end... Oh. I'm getting a hint of berry. Chocolate. Leather undertones. What? Now you're just making stuff up. I ain't getting any of that. That's because your nose is shorter. Which is why Mom always liked me better. Ah, you're just messing with me again. She never said that. Did She? Wait a sec. I'm picking up a hint of magic. Ooh! - Stenchweed. - Duh. You better find the unicorns... ...or Malucia's gonna clean the floors with you. Of course I'm gonna find them, you Noodle Nose. Noodle Nose? You know I have a deviated septum. Sure, Whiff, that's what they all say. Mom never really said she liked you better, did she? Mom said it and Dad said it. What were those? Sniffers. They work for Princess Malucia. Let's go. We're almost home. Home? It's a place where you sleep, and live, and... Don't you have those? Oh, yeah, I just meant Never mind. Home. More of a strategically camouflaged hideout, but yeah... ...home. This is... I... I can't even... I love it. Attention, fairies and mermaids. This is Princess Alexa. She's come to save us. We're saved. I wish you'd stop saying that. Um, Princess Alexa... ...nobody can take me seriously like this. Oh, your clothes. Uh, let's see. If I think about what you were wearing and point... Oh! Ah. Thank you. It worked. I know. You even got rid of that embarrassing berry stain. That was embarrassing. Ha. Mermaids. Huh? Whoa. Hello there. It's nice to meet you too. Unbelievable. Watch out, their horns are kind of sharp. I'm sorry, they are. The fairies and the mermaids... ...have come together to protect the unicorns from Malucia. Are we great or what? Heh. Back home... ...we don't even have one unicorn, much less three. There's one more. The most powerful of all. The Queen Unicorn. She's hidden in another part of the forest. From Malucia. Right. That's where Princess Malucia lives. Whoa. The king and queen ruled Zinnia with compassion. But a few weeks ago, they disappeared. That's when Malucia started stealing our magic. She's been hunting us down with the Sniffers and the Trogs. But Why? If she's a princess in this world, doesn't she have her own magic? Malucia is the only princess in Zinnia to ever be born without magic. So now she's stealing it from everyone else. She's greedy and deceitful. Wicked, monstrous, horrible, treacherous, out of control. It's ready, Your Highness. Ta-da! No! No, no, no, no, no, no, no! That doesn't look anything like me. This has to be the best cake ever in the history of history. Is the first layer chocolate? Uh, yes, Your Majesty. And the second layer's wickelberry? Of course, Your Majesty. Then one red velvet... ...one more chocolate and three more wickelberry? Huh? Uh... I'm not certain. Dear Grodlin, I'm about to have all the magic in the kingdom. To celebrate, there's going to be a party... ...to honour the greatest, most magical princess ever... ...moi. So there better be a perfect cake. Got it? Ah! Your Highness. We found a Youngling Fairy in the woods today. Actually, Your Highness, that "we" would be me. I'm the one who sniffed her out. What are you talking about? I was there too, you know? I smelled her magic wafting through the air. All fairies have it. Only experts like me can detect it. Unbelievable. I hope your princessnessnesss is pleased. She is a tiny snack. I want the unicorn combo. Supersized. Have you found them yet? Not quite yet. But we're out there, noses up, 24/7. Well, get going, then. And don't come back until you have my unicorns. - Don't know when to quit, do you? - I quit you back there. Nice try. I'm still next to you. Watch it, there's a wall. Now, you. Let me go. You're no unicorn... ...but there's magic in your wings. And I want it all. So gimmie. You don't need my magic. Au contraire, my winged friend. There's nothing that's more tragic Than a princess without magic And so I must take What I need from you It may seem an imposition But, hello, I'm on a mission There's no one who can stop me And there's nothing you can do I want it all I want it now Don't tell me no Just tell me how You see this crown? It means bow down What I want is really very small I want it all That's all Getting more magical every day La, la, la, la, la, la I'm totally taking my breath away Yeah. I know that you're gonna feel okay Because it's better for me I want it all I want it now Don't make it small Just make it wow Life has its dings Oh, thanks for the wings But you'll still get around 'Cause you can crawl I want it all Can't wait till we find the unicorns 'Cause there's so much magic Inside their horns It's gonna be like I have been reborn When all the magic's mine Mine Mine I want it all I want it now So just relax Don't have a cow It is my fate to be so great For me to rise You're gonna have to fall It might just leave you Curled up in a ball And my request is really very small I want it all All-inclusive. The whole enchilada with a cherry on top. That's all. You're mean. No. I'm goal oriented. My Wings Now, where were we with that cake? I can make flowers bloom And change their colours too This pink looks better blue How amazing I think of butterflies Suddenly here they are I simply flick my wrist And that turns into this I think I've got the gist Who'd believe it? It's like a crazy dream And somehow I'm the star 'Cause I've got magic Magic, magic I've got magic Magic, magic I can change what you wear And even style your hair Float teacups through the air One lump or two And for the final touch A chocolate fudge souffle' HeY I think I like this world Feel like a different girl You want a string of pearls I can do that Oh, this is so much fun It's like a brand-new day HeY 'Cause I've got magic Magic, magic I've got magic Magic, magic And I can do Anything Suddenly I can be Anything that I dream I can be 'Cause I've got magic Magic, magic I've got magic Magic, magic Magic, magic I've got magic Nori. Romy. I just had a great idea. I can use my magic to change you back into a fairy and a mermaid. Finally. These legs are so impractical. - Um, can you do that? - She's a princess. She can do anything. Ready? Um... I don't understand. And here I thought I was getting really good at this. You are. But I guess you can't put back what Malucia stole. Maybe it has to come from her. Right. From her sceptre. That's where our magic is. We get that, we get our magic back. Huh. Romy's right. I am? With a princess on our side, we can fight Malucia and get her sceptre. Nori, I.. Making flowers bloom and changing outfits is one thing... ...but fighting an evil princess? I don't think I can do that. But, Alexa... So nice of all of you to join me for my magical tea party. Did we have a choice? I didn't. Shush. Tea's done. I'll pour. Your Highness, good news. We found the Queen Unicorn. - But how would...? Aah! - Huh? - Well, it's about time. - Oh! It's gonna burn. Where is she? This is us... ...and this glade is where we think the Queen Unicorn may be hiding. What do you mean "think"? Only one of us does, Your Princessness. I ain't picking up nothing but stenchweed. Lots of it. Your Highness, the unicorn is in that grove. I would bet my brother on it. Excuse me? Give me that. Ugh! This is as useless as you two. Go. "Bet my brother"? Sorry. Hmm. We need to know exactly where that unicorn is. Biscuit? And I think I know who knows exactly where she is. So the Sniffers found the Queen Unicorn. Oh, goody. Grodlin, what are we waiting for? Round up the Trogs and let's go get her. Oh, hi there. So, uh, I'm gonna let you go. But don't you dare tell anyone... ...about me going to capture the Queen Unicorn. - Got it? - Yes. Meany. What? Ah, yes, great and powerful princess. That's better. Now shoo. Go on. Follow her. Someone's here. Nola. Your wings. I had to walk from the castle. Did anyone follow you? I don't think so. But they've found the Queen Unicorn. Malucia's on her way there right now to capture her... ...and steal her magic. And if she does? If Malucia takes the Queen's magic, then gets a hold of these three... She'll be unstoppable. Romy and I will get the Queen and bring her here. Everyone else, stay and protect the unicorns. And each other. We have to hurry. Malucia might be there already. Ugh. Of all times not to have wings. I have an idea. Remember the story about the boy and the flying carpet? - What's a carpet? - What's a boy? Never mind. Get on. Which way? There, over the... Whoa! This is almost as good as wings. I'm the queen of the world. The unicorn is down there. There's a secret opening between those two trees. It's all right. This is Princess Alexa. She's a friend. It's nice to meet you too. But we have to get you out of here. Uh, I think she wants you to get on. I think she wants all of us. Oh. I guess it was just me. I really miss my wings. We made it. You're safe now. Alexa, without you, we wouldn't have made it before Malucia. I'm glad I could help. Can you imagine the look on Malucia's face... ...when she finds out the unicorn's gone? She'll be like, "How did this happen?" And then all, "Where's my unicorn?" I know exactly where my unicorn is. Malucia. That's Malucia? Hi there. It was so nice of your little Wingless friend to lead us here. It seems I've already got your magic. So I guess I'll just be taking my unicorn. Go, run. - Good unicorn. - That's it. If you wouldn't mind. Get them! Was that magic? Alexa, hide. Who are you? Watch that unicorn. And don't let those two go. I'm the only one who can have magic. Whoa! Unh. I'll just have to get her magic later. Now, where were we? - There they are. - They're back. Oh, it's them. Wait, there's... Ta-da! Hey, you guys are having a party? And you didn't invite me'? Now let's have some fun. Hello? Is anybody here? Your wings. Your tail. Alexa? Malucia took everyone's magic. And the unicorns. Oh, no. Why did you come back? I just had to. Everyone. I know you feel helpless right now, but I still have my magic. She does? Ready for another magic carpet ride? Oh, no. The unicorns. Oh, no. We're too late. That's it. She has all the magic. There'll be no living with her now. There was no living with her before. Oh, dear. That was good. Yes-haw! Now let's pass out the hats and bring out my cake. Malucia won. She got it all. No. Not all of it. But what can you do? Her magic is too strong now. You never know what you can do unless you try. And now that I have all the magic... Cake! Hold on. Where is my picture? Your Majesty, no cake decorator is equal to the task of drawing your portrait. The only person who could do justice to the princess... ...is the princess herself. - Well played. - Mm-hm. You're right. I did it. Ha! I can do anything now. All I needed was enough magic. Whoo-hoo! Yeah! - Excuse me. - Oh! Harry, wake up. Huh? What? Who goes there? Try me. We wish to formally surrender to the great and powerful Malucia. - Um, of course. - Right then. This way. Wipe your feet. - Look at that. - Look at that. Well done, lads. Ooh. So pretty. Yes, they put up quite a fight, Your Highness. But we managed to subdue them. Good work, guys. Now, scram. I remember you two. You put up quite a fight when I took your magic. But you, you're not a fairy or a mermaid. I'm a princess. Right. I'm the only princess around here. I bet you don't even have real magic. Sniffers! I think my nose is gonna explode. Whoa! That's the most magic I've smelled in ever. Duh, I just took the magic from, like, everybody... ...and the four unicorns. No, Your Highness, not you. Her. Uh, Sniff, tell the nice princess... ...that she's still the most magical creature in the whole kingdom, right? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, of course. The most magical creature. You owe me big time. Okay, Your Highness. Apparently you're not up on all the latest princess rules. Like how no one gets to have magic in this kingdom except me. About that. I'll make a deal with you. What kind of deal? Give everyone their magic back, and I'll let you go. You'll let me go? Heh. That's really funny. Isn't that funny? Ah, yes. Ha, ha! Oh, yes. Yes. Ha, ha. Ha-ha-ha. Have a seat. All right, Princess lmposter Pants, let's see what you've got. Impressive. Hey - Candy. - Oh, my sweet tooth. Bring me some. Love it. Run for your lives. Now you did it. You ruined my party. Unh. Whoa! - Alexa. - Alexa. Your Highness, I really must protest. Quiet. Unh. Oh. Anyone else got something to say? Gotcha. - You have enough magic. - No. - I want it all. - Whoa! Who's gonna be the most magical princess now? Okay, Malucia. You want it all? Take it. - Alexa, no. - Alexa, no. Well, if you insist. I got it all. Oh, no. No. Could this be happening? Feels like I've got my wings This is the sweetest thing Look, I'm flying This is a dream come true Now everything's okay My tail is back again Hello, my long lost friend Look at it sparkling just like diamonds Now I'm myself again Can't wait to make some waves 'Cause I've got magic Magic, magic I've got magic Magic, magic Oh Thank you, Your Highness.

We're home. Mommy. Daddy. Did you miss us, pudding? Were you a good girl for Grodlin while we were away? Yes. Oh, Malucia. Did you try and take over the kingdom again? No. Malucia. Maybe. Well, we'll deal with that after we give you your present. I wonder what it could be. Don't you love surprises, pumpkin? Give me, give me, give me. Huh? Don't forget us. Never. I'm guessing you don't miss your legs. Not one bit. Heh. Come back and visit us'? I Will. Princess Alexa! Princess Alexa. Princess Alexa. Over here, Brookhurst. Ah. There you are, Your Highness. Your mother thought perhaps you were still in your room, reading. - What a lovely dress. - Heh. Thank you. I thought I'd better alert you... ...the young equestrians have gathered on the north lawn. You may want to take another path back to the palace. No, Brookhurst. I'd like to see them. And speak to them. You do? I wanna try. Are you feeling well? Fever, perhaps? I'm fine, Brookhurst. Well, this way, Your Highness. Hi. Thanks for inviting me today. I'm going to speak to my parents... ...about letting your club use the royal stables... ...to give riding lessons to all the children of our kingdom. That's so nice of you. I hope I'm not interrupting. Alexa? Of course not. This is the ambassador of Hilgovia, and Prince Keiran. It's very nice to meet you. So, what do you like to do in Hilgovia? - I like to ride horses, fence... - What on earth has gotten into her? Perhaps it's something she read. So how do I look? Magical. Oh. I finished your book. And? You know exactly what I like. Ladies and gentlemen... ...King Terrance, Queen Adrienne, and the Princess Alexa. Good evening, everyone. As is our tradition, we'll start the festivities with the royal waltz. Tonight, for the first time... ...I will be accompanied by my daughter, the princess. I think Prince Keiran would like to dance with you. Maybe another time. I'm perfectly happy dancing with you. But if it's okay... ...there's actually another dance I'd like to do. Come on. What on earth? All I really wanna do is be right here And be just who I am Yeah, I'm finally stepping up To centre stage To lend a helping hand Every princess needs a story This one will be mine 'Cause I'm in the perfect place And now's the perfect time What's gonna happen?
