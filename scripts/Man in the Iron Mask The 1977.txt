BUT, AN ORDER FROM THE MINISTER, M. FOUQUET. [SCREAMS FROM TORTURE] THE RACK, MADEMOISELLE, STILL THE BEST WAY TO LOOSEN THE VILLAINS TONGUE. [FAINT CRY] TELL ME, MONSIEUR, WHY DOES A BEAUTIFUL YOUNG LADY OF HIS MAJESTY'S COURT WISH TO SEE A WRETCH LIKE THIS DE LA VALLIERE. SHE'S THE MAN'S DAUGHTER. A FACT THAT MONSIEUR FOUQUE WOULD NOT WANT PUBLISHED. AS GOVERNOR OF THE BASTILLE ONE LEARNS TO BE DISCREET. PLEASE. MONSIEUR. MONSIEUR, I DEMAND TO KNOW WHY I'M HERE. WHAT HAVE I DONE? WHO IS MY ACCUSER? WHEN AM I TO BE TRIED? [DOOR SLAMS SHUT] TO HEAR THEM COMPLAIN, THEY ARE ALL INNOCENT. [UNLOCKS, OPENS DOOR] ALONE, AS WAS PROMISED. FIVE MINUTES, NO MORE.

MONSIEUR, MONSIEUR, MONSIEUR, [LAUGHTER] NE.., N'EST PAS QUI, QUI VOUS APPELEZ GUENARAIS? QUIET. [SPEAKING FRENCH] [SPEAKING FRENCH] SEE HOW THE HAWK AND THE FALCON CONSPIRE TOGETHER? I WONDER WHAT EVIL THEY'RE HATCHING. FOUQUET. -THE MASTER JUGGLER AT WORK. - THE NATIONAL TREASURY PLUNDERED. THE VERY WEALTH OF FRANCE SMOOTHLY CHANNELED INTO PERSONAL GLORY IN HIS CHATEAU AT LOWE. MAYBE WE SHALL SEE HIM PAY IT BACK ONE DAY. BUT LOOK AT THE REAL SCOURGE OF FRANCE. THIS WATER LILY WHO CALLS HIMSELF A KING. PATIENCE, D'ARTAGNAN, THE REAL LOUIS STILL WEARS THE CROWN AND BEARS THE SCEPTER. ANY ACTION AGAINST HIM MUST BE A LAST RECOURSE. IT CANNOT BE SOON ENOUGH FOR ME. FOUQUET HAS EARS EVERYWHERE. HE MUST NOT GET WIND OF OUR PLAN UNTIL WE ARE READY TO ACT. I WILL COUNT THE MINUTES TILL THE DAY. SHHHHH. I TELL YOU...HE LIVES. WHERE? IN THE BASTILLE. GOD KNOWS WHAT STROKE OF FATE PUT HIM THERE FOR ME TO FIND. FAITH, UH, THIS IS THE WORK OF THOSE JEALOUS OF MY POWER OVER THE KING. COLBERT. YES, I LONG SUSPECTED THAT. THE VENERATED MINISTER OF THE INTERIOR TO HAVE A PLO TO DO ME DAMAGE. BUT, A MOVE SO BOLD AS THIS, IS NOT ONLY AGAINST ME, IT'S UH... COULD BE TREASON! DELICIOUS. I'LL HANG THE OLD FOX YET. ARE YOU CERTAINLY SURE IT'S THE BOY? COULD BE A PROTG OF CARDINAL MAZARIN, NOT JUST SOME LOOK-A-LIKE? THE RESEMBLANCE IS TOO PERFECT. IT HAS TO BE. WE MUST BE CERTAIN. MUST. [JAIL DOOR OPENS] WHO ARE YOU? WHAT DO YOU WANT? WHO BROUGHT THIS PRISONER HERE? I DON'T KNOW WHO ARRESTED HIM. THE ORDER WAS SIGNED BY SOME OBSCURE PREFECTURE IN BURGUNDY. NO ONE MUST SEE THAT PRISONER WITHOUT MY AUTHORIZATION. GUARD HIM WELL OR IT WILL BE YOUR NECK. REST ASSURED, MINISTER. REST ASSURED. [JAIL DOOR CLOSED] [APPLAUSE AND PRAISE] BEAT THAT MONTFLEURY, IF YOU CAN. OH! IF YOU DARE. WHAT, AND RISK ANOTHER TANTRUM. I SHALL MISS BY A LEAGUE, MY DEAR. HOW BRAZENLY DE LA VALLIRE FLIRTS WITH YOUR HUSBAND, MADAME. HOW OPENLY YOUR SON ENCOURAGES HER, MADAME. AW! WHAT A PITY! [LAUGHTER] [CROQUET BELL TINKLES] [APPLAUSE] AH, FOUQUET, IF YOU'VE COME TO JOIN THE GAME YOU ARE TOO LATE. WE ARE BORED WITH IT, AND HAVE FOUND OURSELVES A NEW DISTRACTION. I SEEK A WORD IN PRIVATE. WITH YOUR MAJESTY ON A MATTER OF SOME URGENCY. WHAT A TEDIOUS MAN YOU ARE, FOUQUET. YOU HAVEN'T ASKED THE SCORE. I'LL WAGER YOUR MAJESTY PLAYED AS SUCCESSFULLY AS USUAL. WE HAVE WON EVERY SET. CONGRATULATIONS, SIRE. COME TO OUR CHAMBERS LATER.....MUCH LATER. HOW CAN WE ENDURE SUCH HUMILIATION WITH A SMILE? EASILY, MADAME, IF I KEEPS HIM FROM MY BED WITH A COMMON COUNTRY GIRL? YOU ARE NOT THE ONLY ONE TO BE UPSET. LOOK AT THEM THERE. I ADMIRE YOUR STRENGTH, MONSIEUR. NO SACRIFICE IS TOO GREAT, DUVALL, IF ONE PLEASES ONE'S SOVEREIGN. WHY IS THAT? MADAME, IF LOUIS TAKES THE GATES PRIZE. EXQUISITE. BUT WE WILL HAVE TO ARRANGE FOR A NEW WARDROBE. HIS MAJESTY IS TOO KIND. NOT AT ALL. IT IS A PITY TO HIDE SUCH ASSETS. YOU DESERVE GOWNS THA WILL SHOW THEM OFF. AND ALLOW ONE A GLIMPSE OF PARADISE. COME, COME. WHY SO SHY? SURELY YOU HAVE GUESSED BY NOW THAT I WOULD GIVE THE WORLD FOR YOU. SIMPLY ASK, AND IT WILL BE YOURS. YOU MAJESTY, I WOULD NOT PRESUME... MY DEAR GIRL, I EXPECT YOU TO PRESUME. PRESUME TOO MUCH. DEMAND MORE THAN I CAN FULFILL. THAT WILL BE MY AGONY AND MY JOY. SUCH IS THE GAME OF LOVE. AT WHICH, I PERCEIVE YOU ARE NEW. ALAS, I FEAR I WILL NEVER KNOW THE RULES. NONSENSE. I WILL INSTRUCT YOU. FOR EXAMPLE, WHEN I SHOWER YOU WITH GIFTS, DO NOT BE TOO QUICK TO SHOW YOUR PLEASURE. POUT AWHILE AND LOOK DISSATISFIED. BUT SURELY THAT WOULD HURT YOUR FEELINGS, SIRE. YES. YES. NOW YOU BEGIN TO UNDERSTAND. I WILL GROVEL AT YOUR FEET. LIKE THIS. AND KISS THE HEM OF YOUR GOWN, LIKE THIS. AND BEG YOU TO FORGIVE ME. YOUR MAJESTY. HMM, HMM. [CHUCKLING] [LAUGHING] AH, MONSIEUR, WE HAVE BEEN WAITING.... [PLEADING TO SEE THE KING] WILL HIS MAJESTY SEE ME NOW? - HIS MAJESTY CRAVES THE MINISTER OF THE INTERIOR'S INDULGENCE A LITTLE WHILE LONGER. [PLEADING FOR FOUQUET'S HELP] [FOUQUET] MUCH LATER. MONSIEUR COLBERT, D'ARTAGNAN. MONSIEUR. YOU ARE LOOKING MORE FIT THAN EVER. THANK YOU. AND YOU'RE LOOKING MORE PROSPEROUS THAN EVER, MONSIEUR. MONSIEUR. DO YOU HEAR THEM? HOW MUCH LONGER MUST WE SUFFER THIS? WE MUST NOT AC IMPETUOUSLY. IMPETUOUSLY? OUR SHORES ARE THREATENED FROM ABROAD. OUR PEOPLE CRY OUT FOR BREAD, AND LOUIS WRITES ODES TO PEACE AND DANCES THE MINUET. WHAT IS TO BECOME OF PARIS WITH SUCH A KING? [KNOCKING] THE DOOR. IGNORE IT, THEY WILL GO AWAY. [KNOCKING LOUDER] ENTER. [DOOR OPENS] YOUR MAJESTY. AH, FOUQUET. HOW QUICK YOU ARE. PRAY, FORGIVE THE INTRUSION, BUT THE BUSINESS THAT I SPOKE OF... I FEAR IT CANNOT WAIT. ALAS, MY DEAR, SUCH ARE THE BURDENS OF MONARCHY. PLEASE LEAVE US. UH, NO, THROUGH HERE. THE GATES TO YOU NEW APARTMENT. THROUGH THIS PASSAGE WE CAN COME AND GO UNOBSERVED BY THE QUEEN. AND MY MOTHER. TOO SOON, MY ONE AND ONLY LOVE. AH, FOUQUET. WHAT A DELIGHT SHE IS. SUCH.... TRANSPARENT INNOCENCE, SUCH INCANDESCEN BEAUTY. SHE SEEMS DEMURE. YES. TOO DEMURE, WE MUST ADMIT. WE ARE AT OUR WIT'S END. PERHAPS, UH,........ I COULD HELP PERSUADE THE GIRL. YOU HAVE HER CONFIDENCE? TO SOME SMALL DEGREE. IF YOU COULD BUT CONVINCE HER TO TRUST HERSELF TO US. WE WOULD BE MOST GRATEFUL IN TURN, MONSIEUR FOUQUET. YOUR MAJESTY. YES. AND NOW YOUR PRESSING BUSINESS. HOW COULD YOU BE SO COLD HEARTED? OH, HENRIETTA, THE FACE I SEE BEFORE ME I COULD EASILY LOVE. THE MAN BEHIND THE FACE. OH, LOUISE! [GASP] I LEFT MY FAN. THE QUEEN WILL SURELY FIND IT THERE. [KING'S VOICE WITHIN] - YOU MUST BE MAD, FOUQUET. - ARTUNE NEVER DIED AT BIRTH. HE LIVES, SIRE, I ASSURE YOU. THAT DEATH WAS THE INVENTION OF YOUR FATHER'S FIRST MINISTER. MAZARIN. A LIE THAT HE TOLD TO THE KING WHICH HE ACCEPTED IN GOOD FAITH. THE INFAN WAS STILL-BORN. IN FACT, HE LIVED, AND WAS TAKEN AWAY, AND BROUGHT UP IN A SECRET PLACE. ON THE PRETEXT OF SPARING YOU MOTHER OF FURTHER GRIEF, A SECRET, QUICK FUNERAL WAS PREPARED AND A COFFIN WAS BURIED. LORD KNOWS WHO WAS REALLY IN THAT COFFIN. THE ONE THING THAT IS NOW CERTAIN, SIRE, IT WAS NOT YOUR BROTHER, PHILIPPE. BUT WHAT COULD IT BE MATTER AND MOTIVE IN ALL THIS? SIRE, THE FIRST BORN IS RIGHTFUL HEIR TO THE THRONE. YOU ARE THE SECOND SON. NOW, HE HAVING IN HIS CONTROL THE LEGITIMATE HEIR HAD THE POWER TO MANIPULATE YOU. HORROR, MOTHER, WHO WOULD LET HER LOVE A MANNER A USURPER LOUIS, A PUPPET KING. PRECISELY. THE GROUND WE STAND UPON TURNS TO QUICKSAND. FORTUNATELY MAZARIN DIED BEFORE HE WAS ABLE TO REPLACE YOU ON THE THRONE WITH YOUR BROTHER PHILIPPE. AND THE SECRET DIED WITH HIM. THAT IS, WE THOUGHT SO UNTIL NOW. ARE YOU CERTAIN BEYOND A DOUB THAT THIS IS OUR BROTHER PHILIPPE? I HAVE MYSELF SEEN THE BIRTHMARK. FORGIVE ME. IDENTICAL WITH THE ONE YOUR MAJESTY BEARS. WHAT A FOOL LOUIS HAS BEEN TO THINK HIS CROWN SECURE. SIRE, FEAR NOT. I HAVE THE PRETENDER IN SAFE CUSTODY. WHAT HAVE YOU DONE WITH PHILIPPE? IS HE SAFE AND SOUND? WHAT COULD BE SAFER AND MORE SOUND THAN THE BASTILLE. THE BASTILLE? WHERE BETTER TO HIDE HIM FROM FOUQUET'S SPIES. DOES HE SUSPECT ANYTHING? NO, NOTHING. HE'S HAUNTED BY THE MYSTERY. IT WOULD BE AN ACT OF MERCY TO LET HIM KNOW. WE MUST SAY NOTHING YET. WE SHOULD TELL HIM HIS TRUE IDENTITY. YOU AND I ARE FLIRTING WITH HIGH TREASON, MY FRIEND. LET PHILIPPE REMAIN IGNORANT, FOR HIS OWN SAKE AS WELL AS OUR OWN. THE RACK CAN LOOSEN ANY MAN'S TONGUE. EVEN THAT OF A PRINCE. WHO HAS REVIVED THIS CONSPIRACY AGAINST US? NAMES? I CANNOT POINT THE FINGER UNTIL I HAVE MORE PROOF. GET IT, AND WHEN YOU HAVE IT, WE WILL EXTRACT OUR RETRIBUTION. HAS OUR BROTHER ANY PROPERTY? WHY, UH, JUST A SMALL ESTATE IN BURGUNDY, I AM TOLD. CONFISCATE IT. EH. AND, UH, THE FATE OF THE PRETENDER? NOT A SINGLE DROP OF ROYAL BLOOD IS TO BE SHED IN THIS, FOUQUET. WHO WOULD NOT WANT TO TEMP PROVIDENCE BY CONDONING REGICIDE? WISE. VERY WISE, SIR. ALSO WE CANNOT FORGE THIS PRETENDER IS MORE THAN OUR BROTHER, HE IS OUR TWIN. UMM. OUR MIRROR IMAGE. OUR OTHER SELF. WOUND PHILIPPE AND MIGHT NOT LOUIS BLEED? KILL PHILIPPE AND MIGHT LOUIS DIE? NO, WE MUST FIND SOME OTHER WAY. SIRE, I KNOW THERE'S A FORTRESS REMOTE AND INACCESSIBLE. WE LEAVE THE PLACE TO YOUR DISCRETION. BUT KNOW THIS, FOUQUET. WE WISH NEVER TO HEAR HIS NAME AGAIN. AND NO ONE, NO ONE, IS EVER TO LOOK UPON HIS FACE. THAT IS WHY MERE CONFINEMENT WILL NOT SUFFICE. WE MUST DEVISE.... SOMETHING.....SPECIAL? [OPENS JAIL DOOR] WE WANT YOU. COME WHERE ARE YOU TAKING ME? ISLE SAINT MARGUERITE. [HORSE WHINNIES] - ISLE SAINT MARGUERITE. ISLE ST. MARGUERITE. WHAT IS IT? A PLACE OF REPOSE. AS RESTFUL AS THE ONE I HAVE JUST LEFT? OR MORESO. YOU'LL HAVE TOTAL SECLUSION AND CONSTAN PERSONAL CARE. I SEE THE BEGINNINGS OF IT. THANK YOU, MONSIEUR. THOSE SHACKLES ARE MERELY A TEMPORARY MEASURE FOR YOUR PROTECTION, IN CASE YOU MIGH ATTEMPT SOMETHING FOOLISH. I PROMISE YOU THEY'LL BE REMOVED AS SOON AS WE ARRIVE. YOU PROMISE? FAITHFULLY. [SCOFFS] WHAT ARE YOU? HMM? WHAT ARE YOU? A MINISTER. NOT OF THE CHURCH, I'LL BE BOUND. PERHAPS I MISSED MY VOCATION. CHURCH OF THANK GOD. VERY GOOD. PERHAPS YOU MISSED YOUR VOCATION. I ADMIRE YOUR SPIRIT, YOUNG MAN. YOU COME FROM GOOD STOCK. WHAT DO YOU WANT OF ME? IT WOULD BE UNFAIR TO BURDEN YOU MIND WITH THOUGHTS THAT MIGH TORMENT YOU IN YOUR SECLUDED NIGHT. WHAT DO YOU WANT OF ME! VERY WELL. YOU SHOULD BE FEEL COMPLIMENTED. YOU ARE A PRINCIPAL PLAYER IN A GAME. A GAME OF HISTORY. THAT GIVE YOU FOOD FOR THOUGHT? I CAN SMELL THE SEA AIR.

PLEASE, I BEG YOU, NO! NO! NO....NO! - LISTEN TO ME. - NO ONE MUST BE ALLOWED TO SEE THAT PRISONER WITHOU - MY EXPRESS PERMISSION, OR ON ORDERS OF THE KING. AS FOR HIM, HE MUS NEVER LEAVE THIS ISLAND. UNDERSTOOD? YES SIR. [PRISONER WHIMPERING] [POUNDS MASK AGAINST STONE] WHY....................! WHY...............! UGH! IN THE NAME OF GOD. WILL NO ONE TELL ME WHO I AM? I'LL LEAVE YOU HERE, FOR BUSINESS WITH THE KING'S TAILOR. FOR THE ROYAL NAME-DAY CELEBRATIONS AT VAUX. IT PROMISES TO BE THE EVENT OF THE SEASON. AND YOU WILL ATTEND THIS EXTRAVAGANZA? I WOULDN'T MISS IT FOR THE WORLD, AND NEITHER MUST YOU. WHAT ARE YOU UP TO? WE MAKE OUR MOVE AT VAUX. THE KING AND ALL HIS COUR WILL BE ASSEMBLED UNDER ONE ROOF. PREPARE PHILIPPE. THIS ORDER WILL RELEASE HIM FROM THE BASTILLE, THEN BRING HIM TO MY ESTATE AT BERSAI, AS PLANNED. - DRIVE ON. LET YOU SEE THE KING'S COSTUME. YOU MUST BE MAD. NO ONE SEES THE KING'S COSTUMES BEFORE HE WEARS THEM. THAT WOULD RUIN THE SURPRISE. AH...BUT THAT IS THE POINT. YOU SEE, MONSIEUR FOUQUE WISHES TO SURPRISE THE KING UPON HIS ENTRY INTO VAUX. HOW SO? THE PORTRAIT OF HIS MAJESTY WEARING THE COSTUME YOU HAVE DESIGNED FOR THE MASKED BALL. YOU SEE, MS. FOUQUET HAS ALREADY ENGAGED ONE OF FRANCES FINES YOUNG PAINTERS. PERHAPS YOU HAVE HEARD OF HIM: LE BANDT. AH, LE BANDT. THE MASTER OF DETAIL. ESPECIALLY WITH COSTUMES. THE IDEA IS TO HAVE A MODEL POSE IN THE COSTUME AND THEN PAINT IN THE FEATURES OF THE KING. ADMIRABLE. A DELICIOUS SURPRISE. THE TREASURE HIS MAJESTY WILL DOUBTLESS PRIZE FOREVER. MY FINEST CREATIONS PRESERVED FOR POSTERITY. OF COURSE, IF YOU'RE STILL OPPOSED? OPPOSED? I, A PERSON UNOPPOSED TO THE KING'S PLEASURE. POUR SOME WINE FOR MONSIEUR. ONE MOMENT. I BEG OF YOU MONSIEUR. HE WILL SURELY SUSPECT. THEN, IT WILL BE BOTH OUR NECKS. AND STOP SHAKING. YES SIR. OF COURSE, IT'S NOTHING WITHOUT THE KING HIMSELF. WHERE DID THEY TAKE HIM? MS. FOUQUET DID NOT SAY. LEAVE ME. CAPTAIN D'ARTAGNAN. CAPTAIN. WHO ARE YOU? MY NAME IS NOT IMPORTANT, BUT, I... WHAT? I KNOW WHERE THEY'VE TAKEN HIM WHERE? I CAN TRUST YOU. I KNOW I CAN TRUST YOU. YOU TELL ME WHERE HE IS, AND YOU MAY SAVE HIS LIFE. WHERE? THE ISLE ST. MARGUERITE. MY GOD, WE MUS GET HIM OUT OF THERE. IT WOULD TAKE AN ARMY TO PENETRATE THOSE WALLS. I ONLY HAVE A HANDFUL OF MEN. BRAVE MUSKETEERS, TOO, BUT NOT ENOUGH OF THEM TO TAKE A FORTRESS. BUT, WE CAN ALWAYS TRY. NOT BY FORCE, MY FRIEND, BY CUNNING. NOT NOW, COLBERT, CAN YOU NOT SEE WE ARE BUSY? I SINCERELY REGRET THIS INTRUSION, SIRE, BUT THESE MATTERS WILL NOT WAIT. LE COLERAL, FROM MADRID. FOR THE AMBASSADORS TONIGHT, SIRE. REALLY, COLBERT, YOU CANNOT HAVE CHOSEN A MORE INOPPORTUNE MOMENT. AND THE USUAL, SIRE. THE USUAL, AGAIN, SIRE. WHAT HAVE WE HERE? MERELY A RELEASE ORDER FOR A MINOR OFFENDER. YOU CONSIDER THIS ESSENTIAL? FOR YOUR NAME-DAY, SIRE. THIS ANNUAL DEMONSTRATION OF ROYAL CLEMENCY HELPS TO REAFFIRM YOUR SUBJECT'S DEVOTION TO YOU. THEY LOVE YOU THE MORE, FOR YOUR GREAT COMPASSION. HOW SHREWD YOU ARE, COLBERT. PERHAPS, TOO SHREWD? THERE. NOW, MAY WE RESUME OUR PROCEEDINGS? SIRE. LET US SEE THE SUIT BROCADE AGAIN, PASSONER. YOUR MAJESTY? NOTHING, IT... IT IS NOTHING, ARMEIN. ONLY WHAT, YOUR MAJESTY? LOOKING IN THE MIRROR, JUST THEN. A COLDNESS CAME OVER US. AS THOUGH SOMEONE.... HAD WALKED UPON OUR GRAVE. GOD HELP ME. DEAR GOD HELP ME. NIGHTMARES......NIGHTMARES. GOD! BRING ME SOME SWEET DREAMS. SWEET DREAMS. SWEET DREAMS. SWEET DREAMS. SWEET... BRING ME SOME SWEET DREAMS. LOUISE. I SHALL DREAM LOUISE. I SHALL DREAM LOUISE. LOUISE. LOUISE.... [INDISTINCT CHATTER] TAKE CARE, MONSIEUR, LEST THE KING OBSERVE YOUR ADVANCES. [GENERAL LAUGHTER] [INDISTINCT CHATTER] AND, UH..... THUS, YOU KEEP US BOTH AT BAY. WHAT A CUNNING VIXEN YOU HAVE BECOME, FOR ONE SO INNOCENT. NECESSITY IS MY TUTOR, TO MY SHAME. COME, LISTEN TO THE FOX, BY NOT YIELDING TO MY ARDORS, YOU SAW YOUR FATHER THROWN INTO PRISON AND RUINED. BY REJECTING THE KING'S, YOU RISK A FATE FAR WORSE. A WORD TO THE WISE, MY PET, THE NEXT TIME... THE KING OFFERS YOU HIS FAVORS.... [WHISPERING] D'ARTAGNAN HAS BEEN TO THE BASTILLE FOR PHILIPPE. D'ARTAGNAN? THEN HE MUST KNOW THA HIS PIGEON HAS FLOWN THE COOP. A PITY HE DOESN' KNOW WHERE. HE RIDES AT THIS MOMEN FOR THE COAST. PHILIPPE MUST NO BE ALLOWED TO REACH PARIS. OH! OH! GENTLE, GENTLE. I KNOW NOT WHO YOU ARE, OR WHY YOU HAVE COME TO HELP ME. THAT. THAT CAN WAIT, I THINK. ARE YOU STRONG ENOUGH TO RIDE? HUH. I...JUST A LITTLE LIGHT HEADED. GET HIM READY. THERE'S NO TIME TO WASTE. I WANT TO TALK TO YOU. FORGIVE ME, MONSIEUR. NEVER HAVE I BEEN FORCED TO DO SO CRUEL A DEED. THEY GAVE YOU NO CHOICE. TAKE THIS, MONSIEUR, SO THAT YOU MAY NEVER FORGE WHAT THEY DID TO YOU. GOD BE WITH YOU. THIS MAN GOES FREE AS WELL. BUT, MS. FOUQUET... DO YOU QUESTION MY AUTHORITY? WELL, NO, CAPTAIN. WELL THEN, COME THE BOAT IS WAITING. FOUQUET. FAST. CAN YOU GET ME IN THIS, WITHOUT LOCKING IT? YES, SIR. GOOD. GIVE ME YOUR CLOAK. MY CLOAK, WHY? AND YOU GET IN MINE. NOW, I SHALL PLAY THE MAN IN THE IRON MASK, AND FOUQUET, THE FOOL. TO THE HORSES.

[HORSE WHINNIES] [GUNSHOT] [GUNSHOT] [HORSE WHINNIES] OH! YOUR SWORD. GIVE ME YOUR SWORD. NOW, GO. UGH! [HORSE WHINNIES] [PHILIPPE ESCAPING] THE KING COMMANDED THA HIS LIFE SHOULD BE SPARED. WHO IS TO TELL THE KING? D'ARTAGNAN? AND LOSE HIS NECK? YOU AND I.... ARE THE ONLY TWO WITNESSES. THERE IS STILL COLBERT. COLBERT. CAPTAIN D'ARTAGNAN. CAPTAIN! THANK GOD. YOU'RE ALIVE. BACK THERE YOU.... YOU CALLED ME, MY LORD. AND YOU RISKED... RISKED YOUR OWN LIFE TO SAVE MINE. I MUST UNDERSTAND. WHAT IS IT... YOU WANT OF ME? WH... WHO AM I? YOU, MY PRINCE.... ARE THE TRUE KING OF FRANCE. [BELLS TOLLING] IS THE RESEMBLANCE REALLY SO STRIKING? YOU COULD BE HIS TWIN. DIFFICULT TO BELIEVE. I'VE HEAD THE TALE OF THIS TWIN, BUT THEY SAY THE CHILD DIED AT BIRTH. STILL SUCH MYTHS ARE ENOUGH, TO MAKE YOU A THREAT, ESPECIALLY TO AMBITIOUS MEN LIKE FOUQUET. A THREAT, OR AN ASSET. D'ARTAGNAN, IS MY CHANCE RESEMBLANCE TO THE KING ALL THAT LIES BEHIND THESE STRANGE EVENTS? A SIMPLE YES FROM YOU IS ALL THE ASSURANCE I NEED. TRUST ME. PLEASE. WHAT WE DO HERE IS NO FOR PERSONAL GAIN, BUT FOR FRANCE. [KNOCK ON DOOR] OH, THANK YOU, ANDRE. COME NOW. IT'S TIME FOR YOU TO DRESS. THERE'S MUCH FOR YOU TO LEARN. AT LAST.

[BIRDS TWITTERING] YOU! THE BASTILLE. I. HOW IS IT THA YOU'RE HERE? BY SUCH MEANS THA NEITHER YOU NOR I COULD EVER COMPREHEND. MY FATHER. WELL, WHEN I LAST SAW HIM. THANK GOD! [VOICES IN THE DISTANCE] YOU ARE IN DANGER HERE. COME. LOUISE. HOW DO YOU KNOW MY NAME? EVERYTHING ABOUT YOU. YOU MUST HAVE MOVED, HARDLY LONGER. YET YOU REMEMBER ME. HOW COULD I FORGET. I MADE YOUR FATHER TELL ME ALL ABOUT YOU. WE SPOKE OF NOTHING ELSE. I EVEN KNOW WHERE YOU CUT YOUR KNEE WHEN YOU FELL OFF A PONY AS A GIRL. IT'S AS IF I'D KNOWN YOU ALL MY LIFE. I'M THE LUMP OF A CHILD MY FATHER SPOKE OF. WHAT COULD YOU SEE IN ME NOW? NOW CAN THAT EXPLAIN? YOU'VE BEEN CUT. I'VE DREAMT OF A MOMENT SUCH AS THIS. I DID TOO. BUT I DARED NOT HOPE. I NEEDED YOU TO DREAM MY TROUBLED SLEEP. THE TWO OF YOU ARE WORLDS APART. I AM REVOLTED BY YOU BROTHER. WHAT IS IT? BROTHER? THE KING. MY BROTHER? SURELY YOU KNEW. THEY SAY THE RESEMBLANCE IS PURELY CHANCE. THEY DECEIVE YOU THEN. I HIS TWIN? YOU HAVE A BIRTHMARK DO YOU NOT? GOD, IT'S THE TRUE, THEN. IS THERE NO ONE I CAN TRUST? NO, YOU ARE A KING. [FOUQUET CALLS LOUISE] FOUQUET. MY HEART, MY LIFE ARE IN THESE HANDS. AND BOTH ARE SAFE AND SOUND. [FOUQUET CALLS LOUDER] HE MUST NOT FIND YOU. OUR BALLET HAS BORED YOU, MY DEAR? YOUR MAJESTY MISCONSTRUES. GIVE US YOUR OPINION, THEN. VERY NICE. NICE. WE ARE OVERWHELMED BY YOUR PRAISE. YET STILL WE FEEL YOU PREFER YOUR SILLY ROSE TO OUR LAVISH BALLET. NOT AT ALL, SIRE. I MERELY ENJOYED ITS FRAGRANCE. YOU FIND A SIMPLE FLOWER MORE BEAUTIFUL THAT OUR CREATION? ONLY AS ITS BEAUTY IS NATURAL, NOT PAINTED ON OR CONTRIVED. [MURMUR] THERE. YOU SEE HOW TRANSITORY YOUR NATURAL BEAUTY IS. SUCH BEAUTY AS YOUR MAJESTY HAS JUST DESTROYED, WILL ENDURE IN MY HEART FOREVER. [CROWD MURMURS] HOW IS IT, FOUQUET? SHE STANDS US? SHE SCORNS US. I THINK NOW WE ARE MORE A PRISONER OF HER CHARMS THAN EVER. YOU CANNOT ALLOW THIS TO CONTINUE, MADAME. EACH DAY THIS GIRL HUMILIATES YOU MORE. NOT THE GIRL, MADAME, BUT HER SUITOR, YOUR SON, WHO BRINGS DISGRACE UPON OUR HOUSE. THE ONLY DISGRACE IN THIS HOUSEHOLD, MADAME, IS OUR MARRIAGE. IN GOD'S NAME, LOUIS, I AM YOUR WIFE. WIFE? NAY, SAY RATHER BURDEN. FOR THE SAKE OF FRANCE, AND OUR BELOVED MOTHER, WE AGREED TO A PEACE WITH SPAIN, AND GO THIS BAGGAGE IN THE BARGAIN. - LOUIS, YOU ARE SPEAKING TO THE MOTHER OF YOU CHILDREN. MY, AND THERE'S A MIRACLE, MADAME. FAR EASIER TO SPAN RHODE'S HARBOR THAN TO HUSBAND THIS MOUNTAIN OF SALLOW FLESH. OH, COME, MY SWEET, BEFORE YOU LEAVE LET THE WORLD BEHOLD THE SPECIAL VISION OF ECSTASY THAT GREETS THESE ROYAL EYES EACH NIGHT. WHEN WE RETIRE. OW! [QUEEN GASPS] MAY GOD FORGIVE ME, IF I COULD GO BACK AND SEE MY CHILDREN FATHERLESS, I WOULD WISH HIM DEAD. [QUEEN SOBS AND CRIES] YOU KNEW. ALL THIS TIME YOU KNEW AND YOU DID NOT TELL ME. IS YOU'RE FAITH SO SHAKEN THAT YOU CANNOT TRUST US ANY FURTHER? IF SO, ALL IS LOST. YOU SAVED MY LIFE AND RESCUED ME FROM HELL, WHOM ELSE AM I TO TRUST? WELL, LET ME HEAR THE PLAN. SIMPLY THIS, YOU'LL GO THROUGH OF THE KING DURING FOUQUET'S CELEBRATION AT VAUX. THERE IS, HOWEVER, FOR YOU ONE CONDITION. WHAT PRICE A CROWN? THE TRANSITION OF POWER MUST BE SWIFT AND SMOOTH. THE WORLD MUST NEVER BE AWARE THAN ANY CHANGE HAS TAKEN PLACE. YOU MUST, THEREFORE, AGREE TO RULE AS LOUIS THE FOURTEENTH. FOR HOW LONG? FOR THE REST OF YOUR NATURAL LIFE. AS FIRST BORN AM I NO THE RIGHTFUL HEIR? RIGHT OR WRONG HAS LITTLE TO DO WITH THIS. IT'S A MATTER OF POLITICAL NECESSITY. - FRANCE IS TOO UNSTABLE NOW TO RISK A COUP. [SIGH] BUT WHAT OF ME? I AM NOT LOUIS, I AM PHILIPPE. AM I NEVER TO BE MYSELF? WHAT OF ME? NO. I REFUSE TO TAKE ANY PAR IN SUCH A TRAVESTY. WHAT OF ME! POOR PHILIPPE. IT SICKENS ME TO LISTEN TO SUCH STUFF. THESE OLD EYES HAVE SEEN TO MUCH SUFFERING. WHILE YOU LAY ABED, IN BURGUNDY. SNUG AN SAFE FAR FROM LOUIS' REACH, WELL MY PAMPERED YOUNG PRINCE, THERE WERE OTHERS LESS FORTUNATE. CONSIDER, FOR EXAMPLE, MY TRUSTED SERVANT, ANDRE. HAVE YOU NEVER WONDERED AT HIS CONSTANT SILENCE? HE HAS NO TONGUE. THEY CUT IT OUT. HIS CRIME? THIS MAN, THE ONLY LIVING WITNESS OF YOUR BIRTH REFUSED TO DIVULGE THE SECRET OF YOUR WHEREABOUTS. BUT, BEFORE YOU SEVER A TONGUE ALWAYS TRY PERSUASION. THERE IS A PLACE IN THE DISTANT ALPS. AN ESTATE, WHERE THE SUN IS SOFT, SOIL RICH, AND THE GAME PLENTIFUL. YOU'RE FREE TO RETIRE THERE AND LIVE OUT THE REST OF YOUR LIFE, IN PEACE AND TRANQUILITY. YOU ROYAL IDENTITY FOREVER A SECRET. YOUR NEEDS AMPLY PROVIDED FOR. NO ONE WILL BLAME YOU IF YOU CHOSE THE SAFER ROAD. MYSELF....OR MY INHERITANCE. YOUR BIRTHRIGHT IS THE CROWN OF FRANCE. DID YOU KNOW MY FATHER WELL, D'ARTAGNAN? ENOUGH TO LOVE HIM EVER. HE WAS A BRAVE MAN? THERE WAS NO BRAVER, GENTLER MAN IN ALL CHRISTENDOM. IT'S A PITY YOU NEVER KNEW HIM. I.........AM HIS FIRST BORN. I AM THE RIGHTFUL HEIR TO HIS THRONE. CLEARLY THEN, FOR A WHILE YOU WILL HAVE TO PRACTICE PATIENCE. TRUE, BUT IN TIME YOU OWN PERSONALITY MAY EMERGE. - EVENTUALLY BLOT OU ALL TRACE OF LOUIS. - BUT NOT AT FIRST. - FRANCE COULD BE THE ENVY OF THE WORLD. MY FRIENDS... I ACCEPT. GOD SAVE THE KING. GOD SAVE THE KING. PERHAPS YOU ACCESS THE CHATEAU A SERVANT, BUT YOU WILL LEAVE IT A KING. AGH!.....IF I LIVE TO BE ONE. WHAT YOU DOING? A THOUSAND PARDONS. ONE MORE SUIT, I BEG YOU. THANK YOU. THERE! NOW, WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THAT? I STILL SEE PHILIPPE. ONE MOMENT, PLEASE. ONE MOMENT. THE MAIN FEATURE. NOW, WHAT DO YOU SEE? AN ASS. MAGNIFICENT. HIS MAJESTY WILL BE ETERNALLY IN YOUR DEBT. MONSIEUR COLBERT, I MUS CONGRATULATE YOU AND ALSO THE ARTIST. AH, IT WAS NEVER MY INTENTION TO OUTSHINE MY HOST. THE PORTRAIT IS YOURS TO PRESENT TO THE KING. MOST GENEROUS, MONSIEUR. IN APPRECIATION OF YOUR KIND HOSTILITY. I WILL PRESENT IT TO THE KING THIS EVENING, AT THE BALL. MONSIEUR FOUQUET. HMM? CONCEAL IT TILL LATER. LEST THE KING SHOULD HAPPEN UPON I THE SURPRISE SHOULD BE SPOILED. HANG IT IN THE APARTMENTS OF MADEMOISELLE DE LA VALLIERE. SHE DEFENDS HER PRIVACY AS JEALOUSLY AS SHE DOES HER VIRTUE. BE MILD, I WILL TAKE MY LEAVE. ONCE AGAIN, M. TOUSAND, THANKS FOR YOUR GENEROSITY. WHAT POET OF ANTIQUITY FIRST WARNED US TO BEWARE OF GREEKS BEARING GIFTS. WATCH HIM. A LITTLE ALMOND PASTE TO WHITEN THE SKIN. A TOUCH OF ROUGE. YOUR CHEEKS AND LIPS A BOTTLE OR TWO OF SWEET PERFUMES, AND THE TRANSFORMATION WILL BE COMPLETE. [KNOCK ON THE DOOR] PHILIPPE. SO THIS IS THE FAMOUS COSTUME? AN EXACT REPLICA OF THE ONE HIS MAJESTY WILL BE WEARING. HOW WILL YOU TELL US APART? I'VE TAKEN THE LIBERTY OF HAVING A SUBTLE DISTINCTION INCORPORATED INTO THE DESIGN. ONLY WE FOUR WILL BE AWARE OF THE DIFFERENCE. AND M. FOUQUET, OF COURSE. FOUQUET? DON'T BE ALARMED. EVERYTHING HAS ITS PURPOSE. NOW, COME ALONG, MY BOY. M. FOUQUET IS WAITING FOR YOU TO DRESS HIM. REMEMBER, JUST AS WE REHEARSED. ONE FALSE STEP, AND "SCRCK". YES, MONSIEUR. NOW, LEAVE US DUPLICATE A KING. LE BRANDT'S PAINTING IS EXCELLENT. WHY DO YOU QUIBBLE? I GATHER NO ONE HAS NOTICED THE FLAW. FLAW? NOTHING SERIOUS OF COURSE. A SIMPLE OVERSIGHT. IN WHAT MANNER OF OVERSIGHT. MONSIEUR MUST PROMISE NOT TO SAY A WORD TO MY MASTER. M. PATRIN WOULD NEVER FORGIVE ME. I INTENDED TO PRESENT HIS MAJESTY WITH THE PAINTING TONIGHT. IS THERE SOMETHING YOU FEEL THAT I SHOULD KNOW? SIMPLY, THAT IN MAKING UP THE DUPLICATE COSTUME, THERE WAS AN OMISSION.... COSTUME? WHAT DUPLICATE COSTUME? WHY THE ONE LE BRANDT AS MODEL FOR HIS PAINTING, YOU SEE... IT HAS A PURPLE SASH. UMM, WELL. WELL, THAT'S WHAT THE KING IS WEARING IN THE PORTRAIT. A PURPLE SASH. CAREFUL. CAREFUL, I SAY. I FAIL TO SEE THE SIGNIFICANCE. BUT, UH, BUT THE KING WILL BE WEARING A WHITE SASH TONIGHT. DON'T YOU SEE? WHITE? EXACTLY. UH, M. PASSERINE CHANGED HIS DESIGN AT THE LAST MINUTE. NATURALLY IT WAS TOO LATE TO CHANGE THE PORTRAIT. I CAN ONLY PRAY HIS MAJESTY WILL NOT DETECT THE OVERSIGHT. WHAT HAS BECOME OF THIS STUPID COSTUME? I BELIEVE M. COLBER STILL HAS IT. [SIGH OF RELIEF] [THE PRESENT KING LOUIS] [WEARING A PURPLE SASH] EXQUISITE. AH! WE'RE SURE THE QUEEN WILL FIND YOUR MAJESTY QUITE IRRESISTIBLE. THE QUEEN... OFF IN A POLAR BASKET. IT IS LOUISE DE LA VALLIERE WHOSE PRAISE WE CRAVE. [LAUGHTER] WE WILL SURPRISE HER WITH A PRIVATE SHOWING BEFORE THE BALL. [FOUQUET'S CHATEAU AT VAUX- THUNDERING] WE GO. [PHILIPPE WEARING A WHITE SASH] [WHISPERING] D'ARTAGNAN. [WHISPERING] SHE IS HERE. BUT NOT ALONE. IF I CAN'T FOOL HER MAID, I'LL NEVER FOOL THE WHOLE COURT. YOUR POINT IS WELL TAKEN. I MUST SEE HER. ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT. BUT HURRY. FOUQUET WILL BE IN THE KING'S APARTMEN AT ANY MOMENT NOW. HE MUST FIND YOU THERE, NOT LOUIS. IT IS INDEED A TRIBUTE TO M. LE BRANDT'S ART. THAT HE IS ABLE TO IMPROVE UPON PERFECTION, BUT THEN IT DOES NOT SPEAK THE ULTIMATE IMPROVEMENT. [GIRLS LAUGHING] YOUR MAJESTY. A THOUSAND PARDONS, MY DEAR. I MERELY CAME TO RETURN....THIS. HENRIETTA, PLEASE LEAVE US. A MIRACLE, I THOUGHT YOU WERE THE KING. SOON, GOD WILLING. IT WAS FOOLISH TO COME HERE. THIS MAY BE MY LAST CHANCE TO SEE YOU. HEAR ME OUT. IF TONIGHT'S ADVENTURE GOES AWRY, PROMISE ME THA YOU WILL DISAVOW OUR LOVE. I WOULD RATHER CU THE HEART FROM MY BREAST. FOR YOU'RE OWN SAFETY, IT IS VITAL THAT YOU NEVER KNEW ME. I COULD NOT DO IT. HOW I LOVE YOU. IF I AM KING, BEFORE THIS NIGHT IS THROUGH, I MUST RULE WITH LOUIS' NAME, AND NOT MY OWN. AND WITH THE QUEEN AS WIFE. NOT LOUISE. I COULD NEVER OPENLY PROCLAIM OUR LOVE. OH, PHILIPPE. HOLD ME, I'M SO AFRAID. [DOOR OPENS] YOUR MAJESTY. [PHILIPPE DISAPPEARS BEHIND CURTAIN] [DOOR BLOWS SHUT] WHAT SORT OF PRANK IS THIS? WHO DARES IMPERSONATE THE KING? HUH. BUT OF COURSE. A HOAX. A JEST PREPARED BY A CLEVER HOST. MY APOLOGIES DEAR LOUISE. FOR A MOMENT WE WERE.... SINCERELY DUPED. YET, MUCH MORE THAN MERE CHARADE. THIS IMPERSONATOR..... SO.... PERFECT. SO CONVINCING. [GASP] YOU! WILL YOU NO EMBRACE ME, BROTHER. [THUNDER] GUARDS HELP ME! BATTLE. HELP ME! [DOOR OPENS] NOT ME, YOU FOOL. THERE IS THE IMPOSTER. - WHAT? TREASON AND CONSPIRACY. HE DARES TO IMPERSONATE THE KING. - DO NOT LISTEN TO THIS TREACHERY, FOUQUET. THERE IS THE USURPER. TAKE HIM! HERE IS YOUR MAN. FOOL, ARE YOU BLIND. SEE WHO SPEAKS THE TRUTH? DUVAL. ARREST HIM. [THUNDER] WHAT ARE YOU SAYING? THIS IS MADNESS! -ARREST HIM. BUT, SURELY YOU MUST BE MISTAKEN. HERE IS YOU MAN! - I AM LOUIS! - I AM LOUIS. I AM YOUR SOVEREIGN. - SILENCE HIM! WHAT ARE YOU FOOLS... - SILENCE HIM. FORGIVE ME, SIRE, FOR HAVING BEEN SO BLIND. - YOUR MAJESTY. WHAT IS YOUR DESIRE? HAS NOT THE KING ALREADY ONCE DECREED HIS BROTHER'S FATE? [THUNDER] [LOUIS BREATHING HEAVILY] SO....LET IT STAND. [LOUIS GASPS] SO. I KNOW OF A PLOT THAT WAS PERPETRATED AGAINST YOU, AND I PROMISE THAT THERE SHALL BE RETRIBUTION. INDEED. [THUNDER] YOU MAJESTY. [BALLROOM MUSIC] NOW, THE BALL. WE SHALL PROCEED AS IF NONE OF THIS HAD HAPPENED. AS FOR YOU, CAPTAIN,... YOUR MAJESTY. WE WOULD FEEL MORE SECURE WITH YOU AT HAND. DO NOT LEAVE OUR SIDE TONIGHT. I AM YOUR SERVANT, SIRE. MY DEAR. A LITTLE LATER. [LOUIS' MUFFLED SHOUTS] SEND HIM TO THE SAINT MARGUERITE AS ORDERED BY THE KING. HIS SUBLIME MAJESTY, GRAND MONARCH OF FRANCE, LOUIS THE FOURTEENTH. [at Fouquet's chateau at Vaux, king Louis/Philippe begins his reign] YOUR MAJESTY. MONSIEUR FOUQUET. PLEASE ACCEPT THIS OCCASION AS TOKEN OF MY DEEP DEVOTION. TO CONTINUE IN YOUR SERVICE NEED BE MY ONLY REWARD. [the new king surprises with newfound respect and consideration] MAJESTY. [MURMURS IN AUDIENCE] [ WHISPERING] MOTHER. YOUR MAJESTY. [AUDIBLE KISS] MY SON? I HAVE NEVER SEEN... I HAVE NEVER SEEN YOU LOOK MORE BEAUTIFUL. MY LOUIS? [MUSIC BEGINS] YOU ARE WATCHED AS NO MY HUSBAND. I'M AS CONSTAN AS THE SUN. YOUR DANCING IS MISDIRECTED. YOU DANCE AS ALWAYS, MY DEAR. IF MY EYES DO NO TELL ME OTHERWISE, I WOULD THINK THE MAN WITH WHOM I AM DANCING, IS NOT MY HUSBAND. A THOUSAND PARDONS, MY DEAR. IF NOT YOUR HUSBAND, WHO MIGHT HE BE? AN IMPOSTER. WERE THAT THE CASE, SURELY YOU WOULD BE ALARMED, MADAME. I AM RARELY TAKEN BY SURPRISE. AND UNLIKE YOU MOTHER, I CAN AFFORD THE BES IN PERFORMANCE. IT FOLLOWS THEN THAT YOU WOULD BE READY FOR THIS USURPER? MOST LIKELY. READY TO EXPOSE HIM? I WOULD HAVE LITTLE TO GAIN, EXCEPT, PERHAPS, YOUR RETURN TO MY BEDCHAMBER. LITTLE GAIN. BETTER YOUR OWN HUSBAND, MADAME, THAN SOME TOTAL STRANGER. QUITE THE CONTRARY. AM I TO UNDERSTAND THAT YOU WOULD NO BETRAY THIS PHANTOM IMPOSTER? LET US SAY THIS USURPER COULD GUARANTEE THAT YOU WOULD BE NO LESS THE QUEEN THAN YOU ARE NOW. THEN, I WOULD HAVE TO BE SURE THAT MY CHILDREN ARE SECURE. AND THAT THEY MIGH MAINTAIN THEIR RIGH TO THE SUCCESSION OF THE THRONE. WOULD YOU TAKE THE WORD OF SUCH A MAN? IF HE DID NOT KEEP HIS WORD, HE WOULD LOSE HIS HEAD. AS YOU WOULD HAVE TO HOLD YOUR TONGUE, OR LOSE YOURS. SO TRUE. BUT THIS IS AN ABSURDITY. I INTEND TO ENJOY A LONG AND FRUITFUL REIGN. AND SO DO I, WITH MY BLESSING. IF YOU WOULD EXCUSE ME, I SHOULD WISH TO RETIRE. I DO NOT DESIRE TO SPOIL YOUR MAJESTY'S PLEASURE. GOODNIGHT, THEN, MADAME. GOD BE WITH YOU. GOD BE WITH YOU, LOUIS. CONGRATULATIONS, MONSIEUR. YOUR BALL SEEMS A GREAT SUCCESS. MORE THAN YOU IMAGINE, I WAGER. LESS THAN YOU IMAGE, I WAGER. COLBERT, ONE OF YOUR PROBLEMS HAS ALWAYS BEEN THAT YOU TEND TO TAKE YOU BOWS BEFORE THE FINAL CURTAIN FALLS. YOUR TROUBLE, FOUQUET, IS YOU NEVER REALIZE WHEN THE PLAY IS OVER. YOU SEE TOMORROW WHEN HIS MAJESTY HAS DEPARTED FOR PARIS, YOU WILL BE ARRESTED ON THE CHARGE OF MISAPPROPRIATION OF STATE FUNDS. CHEVALIER DUVAL WILL BE TAKEN INTO CUSTODY AS AN ACCESSORY. MY DEAR COLBERT, I HATE TO INFORM YOU THAT YOUR PLOT TO DEPOSE THE KING AND REPLACE HIM WITH HIS BROTHER, PHILIPPE, UPON THE THRONE, HAS BEEN FOILED. THAT IS LOUIS THE FOURTEENTH. ON THAT POINT AT LEAS WE CAN AGREE. IN WHICH CASE, YOU WILL BE THE ONE TO BE ARRESTED TOMORROW MORNING ON CHARGES OF CONSPIRACY AND TREASON. POOR FOUQUET. LOOK AT THEM AGAIN. WHAT HAS BECOME OF DE LA VALLIERE'S REVULSION FOR THE KING? OR COULD HE SUDDENLY HAVE CHANGED OVERNIGHT? OH, COME NOW, SHE WON' BE THE FIRST RELUCTENT MAID THAT HE HAS WON OVER. MY, WE DO NEED CONVINCING, DON'T WE? WELL, PERHAPS WE COULD REMIND YOU OF A CERTAIN YOUNG APPRENTICE TAILOR IN MY EMPLOY. THE SASHES. ALL THAT TROUBLE AND YOU NEVER NOTICED. DUVAL. TOO LATE. HE'S ALREADY LEF FOR ST. MARGUERITE. ON YOUR ORDER. THE KING. THE KING IS DEAD. LONG LIVE THE KING! LISTEN WELL, JAILOR. THESE ARE HIS MAJESTY'S ORDERS THEREFORE THEY MUST BE OBEYED WITHOUT QUESTION THE PRISONER IS QUITE MAD. I AM LOUIS. HE BELIEVE HIMSELF TO BE THE KING. I AM KING. HE IS THEREFORE MOS DANGEROUS, AND MUS NEVER LEAVE THIS CELL. NO ONE IS TO VISI HIM, SAVE YOU. NO ONE IS TO SPEAK TO HIM, INCLUDING YOU. AND WHEN ONE DAY HIS FOOD REMAINS UNEATEN, YOU WILL PROVIDE MORTAR AND BRICKS AND SEAL IN THE ENTRY TO THIS CELL. THEN SEND WORD TO PARIS THAT THE MAN IN THE IRON MASK LIVES NO MORE. LOUIS! LOUIS!
