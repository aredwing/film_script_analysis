Besides, you wouldn't catch me dead at the beach. # What am I gonna do about the sunshine # # That warms my skin whenever you're in the room # # 'Cause my umbrella's been up forever # # My winter sweater fits just fine # # What am I gonna do, baby about you # # What, what am I What am I gonna do, yeah # # What, what am I What am I gonna do, yeah # # What, what am I What am I gonna do, yeah # # What am I gonna do, baby about you # # What am I gonna do about the music # # That flows in me when I know I'm seein' you soon # # Well, there was a time my heart was quiet # # Now I can't stop listening to it # # What am I gonna do, baby about you # # Tell me what, what am I What am I gonna do, yeah # # What, what am I What am I gonna do, yeah # # What, what am I What am I gonna do, yeah # # What am I gonna do, baby about you # # What am I gonna do about the fresh air # # That I might feel when you break my shield in two # # Well, I once was proud Look at me now # # I'm just hanging out on a limb, yeah # # What am I gonna do, baby about you # # Tell me what, what am I What am I gonna do, yeah # # What, what am I What am I gonna do, yeah # # What, what am I What am I gonna do, yeah # # What am I gonna do, baby about you # # What am I gonna do, baby about you # # What am I gonna do, baby about you # You worried about the meeting tomorrow? I guess that won't help. No. Well... maybe we'll be surprised. Writer Jorge Luis Borges likens libraries to paradise. For me, public libraries would be a perfect place, except for one thing. The public. Of all the questions about all the books on every shelf in this library, what do these people ask? - Excuse me. - Yes? Where is your bathroom? Right over there, behind the stacks. John Milton wrote that a good book is the precious lifeblood of a master spirit. And Paul Auster called reading his comfort... and his escape. It's as we feared. With the budget cuts, they just can't justify the satellites. I'm sorry. The economy and the internet. Kind of a double whammy for librarians. Jane, are you okay? Yes, thank you. Remind me to have you around the next time I'm fired. Cool-hand Jane. You really that okay? Sorry. I guess I was just prepared. You have any plans? Oh, now, come on, Ms. Taylor. You can finally reveal to me one detail of your private life. Take a gamble. I probably won't post it on the internet. I'm... I'm leaving for Costa Rica on Monday. Costa Rica? You're serious? Yeah. Alone? Yeah. Jane the adventurer! Turns desperation into a tropical vacation. Now that's the way to live, girl! If a person at death's door does see her life flashing before her... meaningful images, moments of great beauty... what could possibly fly before my eyes in those final moments? Where's the beauty in a wasted life? And so the point of this trip? To create some beauty to play at the end. To make some pretty memories, even if it's in a hopeless 11th hour of a pathetic life. If it seems a foolish final wish, well, I haven't done anything foolish in a while. The white zone is for immediate loading and unloading of passengers only. Indeed, dying in beautiful Costa Rica may be the most wonderful thing I've ever done. Ooh hoo hoo! - That was so beautiful. - You... You are so beautiful. You can stay. No, no, no, no. You should go home to your life. We will always have this. Always. Oops. I must go home. Okay, that's it. You can see the ocean from the balcony. If you need anything, just ask, okay? Okay. Pura vida. Oh, "pura vida" is what we say instead of "hello" or "goodbye. " It means "pure living, pure life. " Oh, that way, please. Pura vida. Time for English, Papi. Yes, please. So what's your word for today? Today is... Uh, "capricious. " "Given to sudden changes of mood or behavior. " Ca-prish-es. Cap-ree-cious. Ah. Cap-ree-cious. Capricious. Cap-ree-cious. Morning. Good morning. Are you going to the park today? Yes. It's best if you hire a guide. Oh. Okay. They should charge you no more than $40 for the tour. - $40? - Yes. Okay. Okay. I have accessed the creature. Please. Mmm. Excuse me, ma'am, do you need a guide? I think so. How long does it take? Well, unlike the others over there, I like to be very detailed and show you every amazing thing. I try not to be, uh, cap-rish-us or capricious. - Okay, that's good. - Okay. I also feature the Fujinon 80 telescope, the very, very, very best. I can get you a close-up of a sloth 200 feet up in the tree. - You can see his nose hairs. - Good. Yeah, and you get this and all my acute knowledge, beneficial for you, for only $75, for more than three hours of benevolent work. 75? Yes. The others only go two hours. And it's for my acute knowledge. - It's not, uh, capricious or... - Okay, good. - Good. - I'm hired? - Yes. - Oh, thank you! I'm Juan. Uh, Jane. Oh, Jane, what a beautiful name. It's very accessible. Where are you from, Jane? Uh, Los Angeles. Los Angeles City. When you're here, there is one less angel in the City of Angels. Yes, yes, yes. Okay, we will begin. You're gonna get inside the jungle, and you're gonna see monkeys, birds, uh, a lot of kinds of animals. It's gonna be great. You're gonna love it. So what kind of work do you do in Los Angeles, Jane? I'm a librarian. You work in a library? Uh, not anymore. Oh, you quit. It closed. They closed a library in America? - I can't believe it. - The economy. That's terrible. I love books. I should read more of them anyway. But I love them. This park is only six kilometers, three miles, one of the smallest natural parks in the world. But for our size, we have more species of mammals here, 109, and more kinds of birds, 184, than any other park in the world. Look. These are my favorite. Good. Okay. I have accessed the creature. Please. - See? - Oh. Ohh! We affectionately call them "osos perezosos. " It means "lazy bears. " The sloths can sleep for up to 18 hours a day. They are the slowest mammals on earth, moving about six feet per minute. It would take him almost a month to walk just one mile. They are a true aberration of nature. They're so beautiful. How often do they come down? About once a week to go to the bathroom. The only explanation is that they fear that if they go to the bathroom in the trees, their predators may hear them, so they hold it in and go on the ground, bury it and cover it with leaves. It is interesting. During the mating season, the female will scream to attract the male, and it sounds just like a woman screaming when... when, you know, when she's... when she is loved, eh? Oh, yes. Uh, okay. Bueno. This is a special treat. These are rare. For their size, they are considered the most intelligent of all primates. That's one of the reasons of their small number. Many people take them as pets because they are so smart and get along with people so well. What a pity. Let's go. Are you enjoying the tour? I try to make it actualizing. Yes, it's very good. Thank you. I guess you become very quiet working in a library. Do you have any family? No. No kids? No. I guess no husband. Ever been married? No. Hmm. Should we, um... Should we continue the tour? Oh, yes, I'm sorry. I'm almost finished. More animals come out as it gets later, you know? Well... I have a daughter, Anna. Oh, she's very smart. Very smart. Her English is perfect. She reads a lot. That's good. Yeah. I send her to the American school. Very expensive. Wow! But she can become something special. Maybe a lawyer. She wants to be a doctor. Yes. She's a lot smarter than I am, but she doesn't rub it in too much. Just a little. I guess Los Angeles is a fun city, yes? Uh, yeah, I guess so. Did you ever meet any of the Kardashians? Who? You know, Kim Karadashian and her sisters, mother, Bruce Jenner. No. I don't know them. Kim was the one married for 72 days. - No. - You didn't hear that? No. Oh. That's weird. I think you're too smart to know them, you know? What do you like to do for fun? - Uh, well, um... - Yeah? I read and I walk. Oh, that's... smart. Yes. Can I do anything different in this last part? Uh, no, okay, never mind, it's fine. - It's fine. - Come on, Jane, say it. I can see in your eyes you want to say something. I always want to be better. Well, it's just, I... I'm used to more space. More... Ah, okay, okay, okay. I'll make sure we stay away from others, hmm? Okay? Oh. That's not what you meant. What did you mean, Jane? Please say. Say it to me. Come on. Well, it's just sometimes you just get a little bit too close. - Oh, ah, I see. - Okay? Oh. I'm sorry. You know... It's just my love for what I do. Oh, okay, okay, okay. Sorry, sorry. And down here, you know, we are used to getting close. - Yeah, okay. - Being touchy. - Yes. - You know? - Lovely. - We're Latinos. Okay. That's great. Yes. Okay, but I'm sorry. I won't get so close, okay? - Okay. - Look! Here! - Okay? - Okay. We can talk from here, okay? - Sure. - And I can see you here. No problem. Come on, Jane. - See? That was easy. - Okay. - No problem. Okay. - I'm fulfilled. Let's see some beauty! His colors are amazing, yes? Yes. Yes. Okay? Okay. Let's go. Thank you. Be careful here, Jane. Can I help you? Uh... Grab it, grab it here. Grab it. Okay, okay, okay. Perfect. Oh. Look. This is the Guaria Morada, the flower of Costa Rica. Beautiful. Its beauty represents the beauty of Costa Rican women. Smell it. Do you notice that? No perfume could match that, huh? We believe that when you breathe it in, it brings you peace and good luck. Yeah. Now I know you will have it. - Did I do pretty good? - Yeah, you did great. - No, when I wasn't too touchy. - Yeah. - Yes? - Great. Okay, okay. Let's go. Oh. Yes. Uh, yes. 70, 75. - Thank you very much. - Thank you. Did you enjoy the tour? It was... beneficial? Yes, it was very nice. You're a very good guide. Oh, thank you. My pleasure. I was thinking you didn't bring a camera. I could have gotten some nice pictures of you to remember, like you smelling the Guaria Morada. Ah, what a pity. - It's all up here. - Yes. I can drive you to your hotel. Where are you staying? Oh, no, really, it's just down the beach. It's the first hotel on the beach. - It's a nice walk. - I have a van. Plenty of space for yourself. No, no, really, thank you. Okay, okay, I'll let you go. Let's go. - Start raining. come on. - Okay. Gracias. Pura vida. I'm just wondering, you're planning to see other beautiful things in Costa Rica, maybe the whole eco tour, yes? Yeah, I guess so. I have a van, and I do all places: Arenal, volcano, waterfall, the orchids. I could make you good deal. I'm not really sure of my schedule right now. Okay, okay, I understand. Can I give you my number just in case if you decide? Okay, thank you. Okay. Pura vida. What's the point? The good moments never last. I have no one to blame for this separation but myself. It's as if I received a shot that forever numbed me. Only I gave myself that shot. Jane? Jane, it's Juan, the tour guide. Please go away. I'm very busy. Uh, please, I don't want to bother, but I needed to talk with you. I... told you... if I needed a guide, I would call you. Please, Jane, please. It's gonna be just a minute. Oh... Jane, please. We could sit just out here. Yes? I want to apologize for being churlish on your tour. You weren't churlish. No, I think I was. Churlish would mean you were vulgar. You weren't vulgar. Well, but I was difficult to work or deal with in the moments when I did not give you space, so I was a little churlish. Well, I didn't think so. That's not why you're here. Uh, no, no, no. Ohh... I didn't want to bother you, but you do need a guide, and my situation is not too good. I told you about my daughter in the American school. She's doing so great, really great, but the tourists have slowed down here with your economy. - You know this problem? - Yes. I know money may not be easy for you, but... you came to see Costa Rica planning to hire a guide, am I right? Yeah, I guess so. And it would just help me a lot with my daughter's school if I could be your personal guide. Do you understand me? Yes, but I've changed my mind. I just... I wanna stay here at the hotel and rest. Oh, but... But you can't do that here. I saw how your face lights up when you see all the amazing things. You just can't come to Costa Rica and rest. How much money do you need for the school? I'm sorry, but it's not your worry. Please, it's okay. Just tell me how much. About $500. Okay, I'll give you the money. You would just give me $500 for nothing? It's for your daughter's school. No, no, I can't take it. Please. I want you to have it. - No, please, Jane. - It's okay. No, no, no, I didn't come for a charity gift. No. Ehh... Only if I give you another tour. That's the only way that it's right. Ehh? Come on, Jane. You came to Costa Rica to see the beauty, yes? Yeah, I guess so. Are you okay? Yeah. What are the things you wish to see? - Come on, tell me. - Well... I've heard the crocodiles... in Rio Tarc... Tarcoles, something, are really worthwhile. Yes! They are incredibly worthwhile. Absolutely. What else? There's an orchid that smells like chocolate. Yes, the Sharri Baby Hybrid. I know where you can find them. It's near the crocodiles. What else? I've read about Puerto Viejo. Oh, the Caribbean side. Beautiful, beautiful. We will find you your own beach to get a perfect tan. - Oh, you don't want a tan? - No. Okay, no tan, eh? You should say okay. Please, Jane. Please. Okay. Thank you, Jane. Pura vida. Are you okay? Yes? See you tomorrow. Bye. Bye. I guess he's right. I did come here to see more. Doesn't exactly make much sense to take a shortcut on a final shortcut. Choos-pah? Choos-pah. Choos-pah? Choos-pah. Hey. Please. Puta carro. I fix it in a minute, Jane. Just gonna be a minute. Okay. Let's see what happened here. Oh, we're gonna see now some crocodiles at Rio Tarcoles. And we'll get so close to them, so... we will show lots of choos-pah. I'm sorry, what? What? What did you say? Uh, choos-pah. Is that a Spanish word? No. I believe it's Hebrew. Choos-pah. - Chutzpah. - Chutzpah, yeah, chutzpah. I guess it sounds different with my accent. Oh! Oh... Oh, it's okay, it's okay. It's everything okay. I'm sure you have read so many books. Did you count how many? Uh, I don't know. Maybe. - How many do you think? - I don't know. Are my questions bothering you? I like words, you know. - No. They're fine. - Okay. Okay. How long does it usually take you to read a book? - I don't know. - More or less. It depends on the book, you know? It could be a day, it could be two days. If it's a really, really rich... you know, like a rich novel with lots of rich language, it could be, I don't know, it could be a week. And for how long have you been doing that? Well, I've been reading at least, uh, a book a week for 40 years. Oh. 40 years. Even if I give you two weeks off for vacation, and you read 50 books a year, that would be... 2,000 books in 40 years. Eee-my! That could be a record. I guess it does add up. Well, I told you. I like words. I'm not too big on the books. You could just pick up one and start. Yeah, I will, I will. I want to start with the best book ever. Since you have read them all, which is the best one? Why is that funny? No, it's just... That's... - an impossible question. - Why? 'Cause there's so many different kinds. There's fantasy, there's action, there's mystery. - Oh, I see. - There's romance. What's the best love story you read? Okay, the best love story I ever read... probably was Tale of Two Cities. Tale of Two Cities. Tale of Two Cities. Who wrote that? - Charles Dickens. - Charles Dickens. Tale of Two Cities. Charles... Charles Dickens. Tale of Two Cities. Charles Dickens. I'll make sure that I read it one day. - Good. - You know... I'm Latin. I ask you all these questions about this. - You know why? - Why? It made you laugh. You should laugh on vacation, even if it's at stupid me. Okay. Now I'll shut up, fix it, and we'll go see some crocodiles. Okay. Come on, Jane, come on, come on. Ah! I wonder if I can feed myself to the wildlife from here up on the bridge. Would I wind up as a pair of boots? Or a handbag? Or maybe a belt? Go on, boys, make me an accessory. Whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa. Whoa. Sorry, sorry, but I don't want to find you in a crocodile soup. Come on. I have a better view for you, yes? Jane, please. It's not safe. Okay, come on. You need to have this one. Good photo. I'm enjoying my final tour. Really, I am. There's comfort in knowing I'm never going home. Unlikely as it may have seemed, I'm going out on a high. See? This place is special, eh? Regular tour guides won't take you here. It's for ticos, locals. Tourist places are restaurantes. We call this kinda place a soda, like the soda you drink. - You know? - Hmm. - Pura vida. - Uh, no, thank you. - I don't drink. - Oh, no, you're in Costa Rica. You should try our Imperial. Come on, show some of that North American chutzpah. Okay, maybe just one sip. Pura vida. Hmm? You like it? Yeah. You're right. It's nice. It's light. You do a lot of writing. It is your diary? Mm. Mm-mm. It's my journal. I guess I'm in there now. I hope I'm not a clown. I'd be embarrassed if Anna reads your book one day and her father is the fool who was too touchy, you know? You must see the Caribbean coast. It's a very different world with the Rastas. - Do you know Rastas? - Rastafarians? Yes. I guess this is the long name, Rastafarians. Oh. Gracias. We call this casados. Casados means marriage, and this is a marriage of our foods. It's rice, beans, plantain and local fish, mahi-mahi. Very good. It's casados in the soda. Yes! Very good, very good! Come on. Mix it. Come on. - It's messy. - Mix it. Okay, very good, very good. That's right. Nice? - Beautiful. - Mm-hmm. You can put Tabasco if you want. You could show some real chutzpah and go for number 4. I think I showed enough "hoot-spa" going for numbers 1, 2 and 3. That's right, that's right. Jane? Jane? Whew. Jane! Jane! Hey! It was a beautiful day, yes? Yes! Okay, tomorrow we go to Arenal, the volcano. You should bring good walking shoes. Not being touchy. Just want to make sure the three beers are mostly gone. Okay. Tomorrow should be early. Is 7:00, 8:00 okay? Okay, yes, thank you. Okay. Good night, then. Pura vida. She told you to read that? No. I just wanted to read it. Is that so strange? Yes! This is your first book... ever. - Is she pretty? - Who? The librarian. I don't know. Maybe. How don't you know? You look at her, don't you? Yeah, but I guess I just see how smart she is. That's so sweet, but that means she's not very pretty. Fitting in is a habit you either develop early or not. There'd be nothing more pathetic than attempting it now. Sitting amongst them would make it more obvious what a complete freak I am. Did you go out last night? Well, I went out on the beach for a while. Oh, what a beautiful night. So many stars, yes? Yes. I'm not used to seeing so many. You don't see them in Los Angeles? No. The city lights are too bright. And... smog. Oh, that's too bad. I guess at least you can see the other stars in Los Angeles. Who have you seen? Nobody. None I know. It's ridiculous. Anything wrong? - It's very fun. - Uh... - Yeah? - I'm not... I'm... I'm not really sure about this. Come on, Jane. You will like it. Uh, no, I'm... I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Jane, you do different things on vacation. You are on vacation. That's why you came, right? Come on, Jane. That's why you came. No! That's not why I came. Okay, okay. I'm sorry to push. We can go. Sure? Are you sure? No, no. No vamos. That's fine. We can go. No, wait. No, wait. Okay. You sure, Jane? Yeah. - Come on. - It's gonna be wonderful. Put that foot right here. Okay. Okay, your left. You will like it, Jane. I'll place this on the back. He has to touch you just a little bit to put, you know, the belt. - Doesn't matter. - Okay, okay, okay. - Okay? - Okay, I'm good, I'm good. - Okay. - Hold it right here. It's gonna be fun. Let's go! - I'm gonna be first, okay? - Okay. So you can see me. Okay. Oh! Jane! Jane! Jane! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! I'm really sorry to push you before. - Do you forgive me? - Yes. You scare me playing race car driver. And you're okay? I'm fine. I'm sorry. I just got distracted. But everything is okay now. Yeah. In Los Angeles, do you have any animals? I have... a cat... named Sydney. Sydney? Like Sydney Carton? I've started reading the greatest love story in history. Thank you very much. I cannot stop reading it. You went to the library? Oh, yeah, yeah, well, I kind of tricked you on your third Imperial. When we went to the town, I went to the library. You could've told me. Yes, I know. It was stupid. Anyway, I love the book. I'm only halfway. The French Revolution? Oh, I didn't know anything about that. It's amazing! Maybe If I finish it before you leave, we can talk about it. Is that okay? Yeah. See? I knew book talk would make you happy. Now you can hear it. Let's go. Sorry, but you must have these pictures. Follow me. Be careful. Yeah. We should go. Yes, yes, yes, yes. I'm sorry about the couple. I should have been more, uh, circumspect. - It's okay. - Okay. Pura vida. Ahh... I love the book. Yeah, I'm learning history, and I'm beginning to see why you like the love story. It is complicated. Lucy love Charles, but Sydney's crazy about Lucy. I don't know what will happen. Maybe Sydney will kill Charles. I'm not talking. I can't wait to see. That's the thing about a really great book. You can't wait to get through it, but once it's over, it's actually kinda sad. Yeah, yeah. I always read the last pages of a book really slowly. Oh. Oh, oh, oh. So why did you name your cat Sydney and not Charles? Read the book. Okay, okay, okay, deal. Books are your life? Yeah. Usually after this big day, I give tomorrow off to relax because the next day is the final big trip to Puerto Viejo, the Caribbean side. It's very different and very beautiful. It's home of the Rastas. Yes! Short for Rastafaris. You're a very good teacher. A very, very good teacher. I think you just like learning. My daughter was amazed I was reading a book. She thanks you. - I hope you enjoyed the tour. - I did. And for Friday, you should bring your bathing suit. Have you ever been in the Caribbean water? No. I'm not big on swimming. You don't have to swim. It's good just to be in it. It's such a pretty blue. But I'm not going to push. And it's a longer drive to Puerto Viejo than Arenal, so we usually stay overnight. Is that okay? Yeah, okay. Be careful. Okay, Jane, have a good night. - Okay. - Pura vida. A simple bathing suit. - A place to buy a bathing suit. - Yes. Yes! There's a place in Quepos. I'll write down the name and address for the taxi driver. - Okay? - Okay. And my cousin has a salon for hair and nails, you know, if you want, okay? - You think so? - Yes. - Could be nice. - Okay. What? Nothing, nothing. No, no, no, no. What, what, what? Your guide Juan, he's treating you well? You like him? - Yes. - Yes? - He's a good guide, I think. - Okay. Why? What's the matter? Nothing. I... I just want to make sure that he was treating you well. Why? He doesn't treat customers well? No. No, it's... It's not that. I'm sorry. I was just asking. Have fun, Jane. I write down name. I know it's clichd to be quoting Sylvia Plath, but she did chart her demise with dispassionate flair. "Remember, remember, this is now... and now... and now. Live it, feel it, cling to it. I want to become acutely aware of all I've taken for granted. " I know the feeling. I cried at the end of Twilight. I wasn't crying, babe. It's okay. Women like sensitive men. Go to school, Anna. Come on. I'm late. I need you to drive me. I have to pick up my client. I know. I'm gonna meet the librarian. - Anna! - Papi! "Cipher. " "Cipher. " You'll be okay, Papi. # Feel my heart in you # #And I feel your heart # # I feel your heart in me # Anna, sit in the front. She sits in the back. - Come on. - Okay. And be calm, Anna. Be calm. I'm calm. You're the one who's not calm. - Anna. - Pap... Shh! Don't say it. What are you talking about? She's pretty. Wow! Thanks. I... I thought you'd like the T-shirt. Yeah, and your hair and everything. You look beautiful. Thanks. I've never had a Caribbean vacation before. Well, you're ready for it. Oh, I hope it is okay. I have to drop my daughter off. Yes? Hello. I'm Anna. I'm Jane. Jane the librarian. Yes. I guess... I guess so. Oh. Sorry. I go to the library every day. It's small, but I like it. I know the libraries in America are huge, but... huge isn't always better. Anna, please. No, it's okay. Do you like to read? Yes, a lot. Anything fun right now? We're reading Charlotte's Web by E.B. White. I love Wilbur. Yeah. I love him too. I look up American universities on the computer at school. I'm going to be a doctor. Do you think I should be a librarian? No. Doctor's great. Yeah. I'm going to cure cancer. My mama had that. I'm sorry. It's okay. Okay. Come on, let's go, Anna. Well, you're really smart and pretty. Thank you. - I can Facebook you. - Anna... I'm not on the Facebook. I thought everyone in America was on Facebook. - Okay. - You're probably right. Bye. - See you later - Have a nice trip. Well, you survived Hurricane Anna. She's beautiful. Let's go. # Can you hear the night # # Whisper to the morning # # She's talking about the times # # When the fire burned bright # # She often wonders how # # How the people forgot her # # It must have been the rain # # That washed them with doubt # #And so here we go # # Up off the ground # # Spinning round # Cheers. #Around and round # # Here we go # # Up off the ground # # Spinning round # #Around and round # # Here we go # # Up off the ground # # Spinning round # #Around and round # Eee-my! - You look... - I look like a woman who hasn't worn a bathing suit in forever. I think it's too rough to float. Oh, I agree. But maybe we could just go for a walk. Yes. Listen, I know I don't own you, so if you wanna go for the day, that's... No, thank you. I was planning on watching you have the best day of your life. I finished the book, by the way. Wow. That was fast. Yeah, I couldn't stop reading it. - I was like addicted to it. - Yeah. I felt very bad for Sydney Carton, to love someone so much when she does not love you and still be willing to give up your life for her, so she can be happy with another man and... Oof. Crazy. The last line of the book was so powerful. I read it over and over. I remember it. - Yes? - Yeah. Could you say it to me in English. Come on. Okay. "It's a far, far better thing that I do than I've ever done. And it's a far, far better rest that I go to than I've ever known. " He's happy to give his life and go to death because of the good he has done. Beautiful. Whoa. To Mr. Sydney Carton, who lives in your cat. Okay. You know, I've lived in Santa Monica... it's in California, Santa Monica... for, I don't know, years, and I hardly ever... go to the beach. I forget it's even there. Yeah. I love this place. I love the feel of it. Yeah. This is different from the Pacific side. - Right? - Yeah. - It's different, yeah. - Yes. I love the Pacific side. You showed me beautiful places. Yeah. This is different. I don't know. It's just... I don't even know the American word for it. "Chill. " I think "chill" is the American word you're looking for. - Yeah, you're right. - Chill. - That's it. - Yeah. Chill. Look at this. Yeah, it's from the reef. It's right here. Yeah. Chill. Enjoy your life. To the best day of your life. I'll drink to that. Pura vida. "Dear Juan, I truly am sorry to have done this to you, to have done this to myself while I'm with you. You really did show me the best week of my life. But unfortunately... I'd already screwed up the rest of it beforehand. " Do you wanna dance? Come on! You better, Jane. Come on, walk with the music. I don't want to. I think it's just too advanced for me. - Okay, okay. - Are you... No, no. Come with me. Okay. Here. - You're okay? - Yeah. Are you sure? Yeah. I want to... I want to try. - Okay. - Life is short, right? Yes, it is. Pura vida. Wait. Gracias. - I got it. - Okay. No, I have... I have a lighter. Let me see it. I've never seen one before. Oh. Me first? Stop. Esta bien. Cough it out. Cough it out. - No. - What'd I do wrong? No, no, no. It's... You must do it slower, you know? - Okay. - Okay. Slower, you know? Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop. Out. Okay, okay.

Okay, okay. No more. - Okay. - Not many... Wow. The moon is glowing. Just glowing and glowing and glowing and glowing and glowing. It's really amazing. It is. You feel okay? Uh, funny. Yeah, I don't know. Why? Do I sound weird? No. No, no, no. Your voice sounds like... - Good. - Well, I can tell you, I don't even feel like a pathetic librarian anymore, but... I don't really feel like myself either. That's good. When were you ever pathetic? You're not pathetic. Yes. Yes, yes. - Yes, I was pathetic too. - No, you're not. Okay, I'm gonna tell you. I'm gonna tell you. I'm gonna tell you why now. I am pathetic when I read the dictionary to find big words to use to impress American women. Yeah, to look smart. What, you're up to the letter "C"? Okay. Oh, oh! Enough, enough, enough! It's gonna ruin my day too! No. Just remember this. You're a good man, Juan, and you're a really good father to Anna. So whatever you do, just promise me this. Just promise me that you'll remember that I had the best, best week of my entire life... with you. Okay? Promise? Your lips are like little pillows. Okay, I'm sorry. We don't... No, I, uh... I've not done this in a long time. Jane? Jane. Jane? Jane! Jane! Jane! Are you... sunbathing? Yeah. Are you okay? Yeah. You're in your underwear, Juan. Yeah. Well, yeah. And you? You're okay? Yeah? Yeah. Yeah. You wanna go swimming? It's nice. Yeah. Yeah. Well... you should put your bathing suit on. Yeah. Okay. Okay. I'm gonna grab one. - Everything's okay? - Everything's great. Okay, okay. Yeah, oh... Juan. Pura vida. Pura vida, Jane. Pura vida. I traveled here to do a little living before I died. I guess I did a little too much living. Okay! I have accessed the creature. You have choos-pah. Eee-my! Anna... Papi! Shh! Wait, wait. Come on, go now. - Anna! - Jane.
