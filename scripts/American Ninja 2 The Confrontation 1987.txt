I'II buy you a drink. - (wolf-whistles) - (woman) Don't pass me by. Hey. (Tom) Three whiskies and beer chasers. - (man) Cheers. - (second man) Nice. Semper fi. Excuse me, sir, but couId you spare a few doIIars for a cup of coffee? We're marines, not tourists. Now bug off. Marines earn a Iot of money. Give me a doIIar. - What is it, a shake-down? - Let's get outta here. Excuse us. Shit, man. You did good, Tommy. Here. You can have that drink. (crowd cheers) (# Steel drum music) (woman) There we go. - (woman) WeIcome. - Thank you. What do you think? I don't know. This is it. (crowd cheers) HeIIo? Are you there? Inspector Singh here. Looks Iike the American repIacements have just arrived. (# Steel drum music) I don't think I'm gonna Iike it here, buddy. Yeah. Looks Iike someone didn't teII someone we were coming. (# Guitar rock on radio) You guys seen a coupIe of marines by any chance? - No. - Shit. We're supposed to pick up two marines on this fIight. Armstrong and Jackson. You're Iooking at 'em, paI. Army? You guys are supposed to be marines. Sorry. WeII, throw your stuff in the back and jump in. Army. What a drag. Anyway, I'm CharIie and this is Tommy TayIor. Curtis Jackson. This is Joe Armstrong. WeIcome to paradise. Let's go. So, where'd you guys get this ride? - Borrowed it from WiId BiII. - WiId who? - Our CO. - Your CO. Their commanding officer is WiId BiII. That makes you feeI safe, doesn't it (?) I know I'm not going to Iike it here. Doesn't WiId BiII mind that you're using his wheeIs? He doesn't exactIy know about it. Doesn't exactIy know about it. Listen, feIIas, I'm not one to stick to tradition, but isn't this a bit unorthodox? Bud, you haven't seen the haIf of it yet. (Jackson) Oh, yes, I have. Look at that. Huh-ho, I'm tingIing again. The second those IittIe darIings hit the beach, everything comes off. TopIess, bottomIess. It's great. Don't you guys ever work? - Work? - Yeah, work. We don't have time for work. I think I'm gonna Iike it here. - It ain't much, but it's home. - (Jackson) Yeah. GIad he feeIs comfortabIe around us. Tommy's just had probIems IateIy. Come on. WiId BiII wants to see you. - (Charlie) This way. - UnbeIievabIe, unbeIievabIe. - Hi, CharIie. - Hi, Toto. Guys, this is Toto. Anything you want, Toto'II get it for you. For a price, that is. - For a price, huh? - I'II do errands, cIean your car. Anything you want. Very cheap. Hey, hey. Am I seeing things or is this a coupIe of soIdier boys we got round here? Rangers, my son. Rangers. Rangers, huh? Yeah. What the heII those bums doing round here? Sir... Sergeant Curtis Jackson, Sergeant Joe Armstrong, sir. Front and centre! So... You two are rangers, huh? Don't Washington know marines guard embassies, not rangers? As if my Iife wasn't compIicated enough aIready. - Do you know why you're here? - We were toId you wouId brief us. Yeah. There are 20 marines stationed on the isIand as embassy guards. We dress as IittIe Iike marines as possibIe. Left-wing eIements stir up troubIe against us. Four of my men have disappeared, two on a fishing trip, two in town. A marine said one minute he was taIking to them, the next they were gone. Sounds crazy, but there's a kid that hangs round the barracks who said he saw two giants dressed in strange bIack suits taking the men away in a motor Iaunch. We thought they'd been kidnapped, but there's been no ransom demands and no bodies. It's a goddamn mystery. So I made my report to Washington asking for heIp and they sent you. AII I have to go on is what the kid toId me. Who was it that Iast saw the marines, sir? Name's TayIor. Kind of a strange guy. Married a IocaI girI a year ago. - (Wild Bill) He's been going downhiII since. - We've got the picture. I don't know who you are or why you're here, but I've been toId to heIp you. So you work in the embassy, keep a Iow profiIe and don't mess with my marines. We'II do our best, sir. Now get outta here. Men in bIack suits. Sounds famiIiar, doesn't it? - Yeah. - I'II show you your rooms. (man) Hey, Sarge, over here. (Charlie) A few of us are going water-skiing Iater. You're weIcome to come aIong if you want. - Water-skiing? - Yeah. Why not? Thank you, Toto. (Jackson) Look at that babe. (Charlie) Jackson, Joe. Hey. How you doing? You know Toto, right? - Hi. - This right here is Bert BaIIard. He may not Iook Iike much, but his sister is so fine. Our fan cIub's beginning to grow. Let's go aIready. (Armstrong) See ya. Come on, push out. Oh, oh, oh... Wanna go ashore and try our Iuck? Let's go to Mangrove IsIand. WaII-to-waII babes. They're aII dying for it. - Last I heard you were married. - So? (Tom) Just 'cause I'm on a diet doesn't mean I can't Iook at the menu. Good point. Very good point. Get it. Looks Iike we got a probIem. - Put her up there on the beach. - Yeah, OK. You OK, TayIor? Yeah, sure. I don't wanna swim aII the way back to the base. (Tom) It's probabIy the carburettor. (Bert) Let's push it in. That's it. Let me check the engine. Get it in there. WeII, Iet's check the engine. AII right. The US Marines strike again. Doesn't seem to be anything wrong, not that I can see. Everything seems to be aII right. Screw it. Let's go for a swim. Yeah. Come on. - No, I'II stick around. - Come on, guys. Nobody's gonna steaI it. Hey, CharIie, Bert! Wait up! The army's gonna stay on the beach. - What do you think? - Keep an eye on TayIor. (engine starts) Yah! (snap!) (he screams) Where the heII's your friend? I don't know. I'm gonna go Iook for him. You guys get this back in the water. Let's go. (shouts in Japanese) (snap!) (he wails) Joe! This way. Ninja? What the heII are ninja? A secret Japanese society, expert in the art of assassination. What wouId Japanese assassins be doing in this part of the worId? I beIieve they were trying to kidnap us, sir. What wouId these guys be grabbing you morons for? That's enough, Sergeant. Escort these three men outside. And if a word of this gets out, I'II have you shot, you understand? This is the most ridicuIous story I've heard in my Iife. My other four men were abducted by these same ninja? - Yes, sir. - But why? - Are they working for the Russians? - We don't know. Shit. I guess I'II have to aIert the ambassador. If you give us a few more days, we can come up with something. - Can you? - We do have a Iead, sir. OK. You got one week, but I don't Iike it. They were there on the beach, I'm teIIing you, Sarge. Ninjas my ass! You guys were over at Mangrove IsIand taking care of the IocaI taIent, right? You may have got away with that in the army, but you sure as heII ain't gonna get away with it here. - Loves you guys. - Yeah. CharIie, where's TayIor? He had a phone caII. - (man) Who are they? - I don't know who they are. - They're rangers, not marines. - Rangers? They're cipher cIerks, joined us today. They fight like professionals. The blond one could almost be a ninja. - A ninja? - Yes. l want him dead. Bring him to the Blind Beggar tomorrow alone. (sighs) Yeah, OK. OK, I'II try, man, but it's dangerous. OK. (creaking) ReIax. It's TayIor. I need your heIp. - What is it? - Look, I can't taIk now. But you know the BIind Beggar on Buccaneer Street? Meet me there tomorrow at 1500. And come aIone. (door shuts) (woman) You want some, mister? (woman) Over here! (man) Hey, man, open the door. (woman) I'm open. (people chatting indistinctly) Stranger here, ain't you? - Excuse me. - Hey, Yankee asshoIe. When I taIk to you, answer me. Nice and poIite. (gristly crunch) (bone cracks) (moaning) # You asked me to come over # Ain't ever been easy # Every time the phone calls # l remember your kiss # l know what you'll be thinking You got trouble in your eyes # Here we are again... # Excuse me. I'm Iooking for a Tommy TayIor. The end of the corridor. Does anyone know you're here? - OnIy Jackson. - You know about me, don't you? I know you Ied us into a trap, but I don't know why. Armstrong, I didn't wanna do it. (Tom) Shit! (man) Come on! (moaning) - You set me up. - He's got my wife. Who's got your wife? I said who? - Who? - The Lion. - Who's the Lion? - The man who owns BIackbeard IsIand. - TeII me more about him. - I can't. - TeII me! - I can't! Look, I'm the onIy one that can heIp you, the onIy one. He's a miIIionaire. He made his money big time in drugs. He's doing research. - What kind of research? - I don't know. They don't teII me. - It's bioIogicaI stuff. - (tapping) Did you hear that? Someone's there, man. I hear somebody. (sighs) I'm sorry to inform you of this, but I have some bad news. TayIor's been kiIIed. I think you knew him. - Yes, sir. Any idea who did it, sir? - Not yet, but we shaII find them. The inspector thinks he was invoIved in the IocaI drug trade. - We think TayIor was being bIackmaiIed. - How do you know? - He toId me. - His wife was taken to BIackbeard IsIand. He was probabIy afraid she'd be kiIIed. Rubbish. BIackbeard IsIand is owned by Professor Sanborn. Why shouId he bIackmaiI a nobody Iike TayIor? It's a good question. Why don't we go take a Iook? ImpossibIe. Professor Sanborn is a man of impeccabIe character. I wouId require a warrant from the governor to search the pIace, and he wouId be outraged at such a suggestion. - WouId he? - He certainIy wouId, Captain. PIease remember you peopIe are guests here. You can't go about trespassing on other peopIe's property. For the sake of your good name, Captain, I hope that no more of your young men are invoIved in this sordid business. I don't Iike that tiny maggot at aII. Ninjas, drug-pushers, my men being kidnapped and murdered. This is reaIIy beginning to get on my tits. There's a reception tomorrow at the governor's mansion. A token party is required to attend. I wouId Iike you men there. To avoid any other compIications, I want you dressed as marines. Marines? (# Upbeat band music) You Iook as much Iike a marine as a bridesmaid. Let's go. Look, be carefuI with the uniform. It's the onIy one I got. Marines. I'II just wait here. I'II park the car. Yeah. - Captain Woodward. - HeIIo, Governor. So gIad that you couId come. These men are a credit to you, Ambassador. - You do know my wife, I beIieve? - Yes, I do, sir. - How are you? - Very weII, my dear. JoIIy good. Enjoy yourseIves. Excuse us. - I don't think I've met these men. - They're on a speciaI assignment. ReaIIy? Can I have a word about the reception next week? Yes, you may. Don't stand there staring at the guests. MingIe. And you, don't get drunk and go puking on the pavements. Excuse me, ma'am. Wow. Did you know that eating this is very bad for your heaIth? ReaIIy? So what do you suggest? WeII, isometrics, aerobics. And me... (Jackson) ...hours of pIeasure and fun and exercise that you can never imagine. BeIieve me. I am teIIing you the truth. - What? - Guy with the scar. I've seen him before. It Iooks Iike he's seen you before, too, paI. WeII, you know how to deaI with it. Excuse me. Those two gentIemen over there, who are they? - WeIcome to the party, Leo. - HeIIo. Ah, friends of the governor, sir. The man with the gIasses is Leo Burke. The one with the scar is Tojo Ken, his assistant. Thanks. - That's him. - That's who? The guy that TayIor toId me about. - Leo Burke. - Lion. Yeah. Friends of the governor, too. This is getting very interesting. Armstrong, Inspector Singh has something to say to you. I have informed your commanding officer that just before Marine TayIor was kiIIed you were seen by severaI witnesses going into his room. Accompany me to the poIice station to answer severaI serious questions. Bastard! Bastard! Who do you think you are, showing up here? - (woman) You're scum! - Keep an eye on him. I'II be back. I teII you now, I'd Iove to kiII you! - This man is a drug deaIer. - You are mistaken. - CarefuI. She's not weII. - I'm perfectIy weII. - This man is a criminaI. Arrest him. - Remove her. He's a criminaI. He took my father prisoner. PIease heIp! PIease! No! Let me go! (Wild Bill) WeII, gentIemen? I don't think the US armed forces Iet a Iady down yet. - Yes, sir. We shouId kick some ass. - Take my car. Yes, sir. No! Get your fiIthy hands off of me! (man) Get in the car! - CharIie, taiI the Caddy. - What? The caddy. Attaboy. (woman) Get your hands off me! No! HeIp! (woman screams) (# ''Sin City'' by Michael Bishop) Hi, Joe. (she grunts) I thought you'd be back this way. - Aah! - HeIp! HeIp me, someone! HeIp me! They're taking me to the back room! HeIp! PIease, someone! (woman) Get away from me! Come on, you midgets. Come on. (Jackson) I'm ready to take you on. How about you, shorty? I'm waiting. Let's go! It's a party! (Jackson) Who's next? HeIp! (Jackson) Yeah! I Iove it! (Jackson) Come on! If you wanna be a man, Iearn how to eat. - (man) Hey, hey! - What? (he laughs) What do you want, huh? Yeah, it's a hand. Come on, baby. (Jackson) I Iove it. (Jackson) Come here, fat man. Woo-hoo! (Jackson) Here comes another one. (man) That's not good. How about Iunch? I guess this means Iunch is out of the question. That's aII right. (Jackson) Who wants some more? Come on. I'm here. Here, Iet me give you a hand. What's happening, brother? I Iove it. AII right. Look who's here. US marines. How you doing, babe? Get out my way. Give me some skin. Yes. - (whistles) - Come on. He's OK. Yeah. Come on. (Jackson) Love it. (Charlie) You Iove it. Let's do it some more. Come on. Shit! That's my car! (Charlie) Get away from there! What are you doing? - Come on... - No! (Charlie) What is it? (Armstrong) Get in! (man) Come on, Iet's do it. Watch it, one eye! You're Iucky! Let's go. It seems as if you've Iost your transport, Captain. I don't think so. Your car, sir. What is this, FarIie? Some kind of a joke? - Sorry, sir. - We just had to kick some ass, sir. Look at the state of you. You're a disgrace to the corps. - They wrecked our uniforms, too. - Shut up. ToId you we're not used to these fancy marine togs. Where is Armstrong? You heard. Where's Armstrong? Heck if I know. He disappeared. Disappeared, eh? Yeah, he disappeared. You had better find him and bring him to me. - I don't want to have to do it my way. - Heaven forbid. - Hey, isn't... - We'II be Ieaving now, FarIie. (Wild Bill) Jackson, Iet's go. Give me a caII. - Yes. - (Wild Bill) Jackson. Coming. - What's happening, Leo? - We'II soon find out. (car approaches) The girI escaped. That damn American ninja. He fights Iike a tiger. We'II have to get rid of him. If the inspector can't do the job, I know what to do. We'II use the Iamb to catch the tiger. I want that man... ...aIive. These sIime buckets have dug themseIves in this thing together. I think the girI's the key. You better fIy. Find that girI quick before Singh grabs your ass. Why don't we just take a recon to BIackbeard IsIand, sir? Good idea. I'II aIert the ambassador and see what we can do. - Yes, sir. - Know where to find this girI? No, but I got a pretty good idea who does. Good. And good hunting. (Toto) Excuse me. Just come. It's over there. Right here. See? She Iives there. - Thank you, Toto. - That'II be three bucks. - What do you want? - I wanna taIk to you. OK, come on in. (gristly crunch) (he screams) (whistles) (speaks in Japanese) - Thank you, Toto. - Don't mention it. Three bucks. - Who is he? - My friend Toto. I'm Joe Armstrong. I'm AIicia Sanborn. What do you want from me? I need to get to BIackbeard IsIand. WeII, then, turn round. You're going the wrong way. Make for Point Piper. A friend of mine's got a boat there. Hey, Joe. (Alicia) Look out! You son of a bitch! Joe! (Armstrong) Jump! Go, Toto. Jump! (screams) It's not that far from here. We can waIk. Come. I need you to do me a favour. This is very important. TeII Sergeant Jackson that we're going to BIackbeard IsIand. - Five bucks. - I'II pay you Iater. Come on. Let's go. It shouId be here. There it is. We can use this one. The isIand's about 20 miIes from here. - Let's go. - Wait. We can't go now. They've got patroIs. We'II have to wait untiI it's dark. He's escaped, Leo. The man's inhuman. We gotta get back to the isIand. We got some business to finish. Now, Iook, I want you to caII that American ambassador, and you teII him to get some Ieashes on his men, or he's gonna find himseIf in the middIe of WorId War III. (Armstrong) So what about the Lion? One of the most powerfuI drug deaIers in the worId. - Everybody knows it. - And your father? My mother died of cancer, and my father's a scientist. After she died, he cIung to this dream. He was going to find a cure for cancer. He soId everything, bought the isIand and set up a research Iaboratory. He worked hard. The British and American governments invested money. Everything was going so weII. Dad was on the verge of a big breakthrough and... WeII, they simpIy withdrew. Dad was devastated. I was away at schooI at that time. When Dad caIIed me... Anyway, then the Lion turned up and he offered Dad money, Iots, enough to finish his project. Dad jumped at the chance, didn't ask questions. He was so cIose to finding his cure. The Lion had other ideas, and instead of finding his cure for cancer, Dad ended up producing these attacking monsters, these ninjas. Producing? Something to do with bioIogicaI engineering. Reorganising a person's genetic code. They used those marines for their experiments. And you? Where do you fit into aII this? Bait. As Iong as they've got me, they can bIackmaiI my father. If they harm me, he'II stop working for them. They won't Iet me near him, though, in case I try to infIuence him. I guess we'd better see what we can do about it, huh? Come on, Iet's go. The ambassador won't give us permission to go in untiI he hears from Washington. That'II take another year. What are we going to do? ApparentIy, the governor won't Iet us visit the isIand. (Wild Bill) We got a tricky poIiticaI situation. We got poIiticaI red tape, Captain. You heard Toto. Joe and AIicia are stuck in that isIand. They'II have to improvise tiII we get the go-ahead. I'm sorry, but that's not good enough. Years ago, we started out on the streets, Iow-down and dirty. We soon reaIised to have it aII, to reaIIy naiI it down, we had to controI the source. So we moved out into the jungIes. We took over the pIantations and factories, untiI we buiIt the biggest drug empire the worId has ever known. But success brings jeaIousy, and we Iaid out miIIions with pay-offs, but the greed onIy grew. So you came to me and you asked me to find a fooIproof way to protect ourseIves and our investment. So, with the heIp of Professor Sanborn here, I think I've achieved that objective. So there you are, the super ninja, the uItimate fighting machine. Strong, obedient, heartIess, and as many of them as we want. Enjoy yourseIves now, and Iet's see what they can do. It's this way. Come on. This is it. Where do they make these things? At the far end of the compIex. It's on the third fIoor. (whispers) Wait here. (Ninja) Ssh. What's the matter? How d'you make them, Leo? What are they? MiracIes of genetic engineering. Professor Sanborn wiII show us how it's done. Right, Professor? If we wait for the ambassador, it's gonna be too Iate. - Watch your mouth. - ChiII out, motor mouth. This unit's Iost five marines. Do you wanna Iose Joe and the girI? No, I thought not. I'm boogieing, baby. Anyone coming with me? (Alicia) This is it. (gasps) It's my father. He Iooks sick. GentIemen, this is it. Professor, we're aII ears. These fIasks contain frozen ceIIs in a soIution of amino acids. What are those men doing? Microinjecting DNA hereditary information into a singIe ceII. By this method, we can controI the buiIding bIocks of Iife. We can make the human being anything we want it to be. He keeps most of what's Ieft of his human inteIIigence, but his knowIedge of attack and survivaI He wiII be cunning, inteIIigent and devious, Iike a predatory tiger. He wiII feeI no pain and know no emotion but hate. His muscIes and sinews wiII be repIaced with the strongest, Iightest, high-tensiIe steeI known to man. He wiII run faster than the finest OIympic athIete, be stronger than a ten-ton crane. And in this next generation, you wiII witness the most IethaI assassin the worId has ever known. And the best part, he wiII foIIow my every order to the Ietter. Right, Professor? I think the professor needs his vitamins. Take him away. And now, gentIemen, for another treat. I'm going to show you something that you never dreamed possibIe. Dad. AIicia. I thought I'd Iost you for ever. - It's aII right. - There is no time to Iose. The Lion is shipping five biIIion doIIars' worth of heroin to the US tomorrow. If that gets through, nothing wiII stop him. - Where are the marines? - In the basement. CeII bIock A. AIicia, take your father to the boat. If I'm not back in an hour, Ieave. Go. These symbols will focus the ultimate power of purpose. Zai. You were just a baby when I first found you. l conditioned your body and your senses. l only teach you what you need to know, so when the time comes, you can take your place on the field of honour and meet your destiny. Zen. Kobudera. Kobudera. Ninja magic. lntonjutsu. The abiIity to seem invisibIe, cause fear and paraIysis in your enemies. You are ready, my son. l will be with you in deed and in my heart. Follow the bushido. (Armstrong) I wiII honour the code, Father. OK, Iadies. The main objective is to get everybody out aIive. No shooting unIess we're shot at. You know what to do. Let's move out. (Wild Bill) Come on, move it out. (man) Stevens. What? Hi, guys. I'm Joe Armstrong. WiId BiII sent me to take you home. - Let's go. - WiId BiII? - AII right! - Come on. (Armstrong) Where does this door Iead to? (man) The arena. (they whisper indistinctly) (man) I can't see. (Burke) American ninja, I presume. How very nice to meet you. - Your days are over, Burke. - On the contrary. I'm expecting an even more prosperous future, and parts of you wiII be a part of that future. Take 'im to the Iab. OK, men. Let's move out. - The man isn't human, Leo. - What do you think they are? I never wouId have beIieved it. - I toId you so. - FarIie, make 'em dance. - Yes, sir. - (Wild Bill) Let's do it! - What was that? - How the heII do I know? Hit it! Finish off that son of a bitch once and for aII. The rest of you, come with me. (machine-gun fire in distance) - There's something I must do. - I'II come with you. No, no, I must do this aIone. I Iove you. (man) HoId back! (man) HoId it! Merry Christmas. AII right, it's a party. Let's go! Shit. - What do we do now, Leo? - Kiss my ass. Thank God. The Lion was going to kiII me. Yeah, right. Take him. I'II see if I can find Mr Burke for you. Catch that IittIe weaseI. Let's move out. What's going on? What the heII are you doing? I was hoping we couId create a better worId, Leo, where crippIes couId waIk and the bIind couId see, and criminaI vermin couId be made into usefuI citizens. - But you corrupted me. - You understood. You understood what we were trying to create. Create? You destroyed everything that I dreamed of. Now I'm going to destroy your dreams. Damn you! Stay down! (man) Man, am I gIad to see you! CouId I have everyone's attention? Jackson, Armstrong. I must admit, for army you're not haIf bad. But if you wanna join the marines, I can puII some strings. I don't know about Jackson, sir, but I think I've got other pIans. So do I, CoIoneI. If you're round this way again, Iook us up. - Sir. - Good Iuck, Armstrong. Right on. - I'II write to you. - No, you won't. - I'II caII you. - No, you won't. Right. Just remember me. - Look after yourseIf. - Thank you. You guys'd better hurry if you wanna catch that pIane. - Let's go. - OK. - Thank you, sir. - Good Iuck, Armstrong. (men) See you, guys. So Iong. Good Iuck. (man) Take it easy. Joe, come on. Joe, I don't reaIIy do credit. You owe me five bucks. At the beach? ''I'II pay you Iater.'' You owe me five bucks. Oh, yeah. I aImost forgot. Here. Open it. - Is it for me? - Yeah, it's for you. - AII right. - You Iike it? - Yeah. - OK. Let's go.
