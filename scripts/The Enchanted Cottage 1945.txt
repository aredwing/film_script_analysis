I think you should go ahead, John. You can play it for them some other time. I guess so, yes. Good people. I'm afraid this performance will be a little bit like Hamlet  without Hamlet. Because I've just received a message that Oliver and Laura may not be here. Oliver has to work. Ohh, what a shame! He salacious to get the blueprints of his new plane before the board at least next week. I daresay, the airplane industry is a little more important than listening to a musical composition. Even mine. So perhaps I better begin. I suppose you could call this the first public performance of my new tone poem, "The Enchanted Cottage." It's too bad that Laura and Oliver can't be here because it's their story, really. You're going to have to let your imagination supply the orchestral accompaniment. No place has ever had could ever have had a more enchanting legend. Here it was. All that remained of a great estate. Built long ago by an English nobleman, come to live out his life on these New England shores. The house had burned. But it's plan was still marked by the crumbling walls. Overgrown now with moss and ivy. Wild roses and forest violets. Miraculously, one wing had been saved from the flames. It had been remodeled. And the nobleman used to lend it to young married couples to live in as long as they wished. But by the time I first came upon it, this gracious tradition was abandoned and almost totally forgotten. The present-day owner, I had learned, was a lone widow. Mrs. Abigail Minnett, who kept her distance and made others keep theirs. Being blind, I could only see the cottage, only with the inner eye of imagination. And through the eyes of my young nephew. I had him walk me to where I could stand. To try to sense the rapture of the love. The happiness so many men and women have known there. Those things mean music. And as a composer, I longed to capture that music. But it continued to elude me. It was not until that wintry Sunday morning several years ago, when Laura Pennington first came to the cottage, that I began to feel... perhaps the meaning of this strange enchantment would reveal itself to me  somehow. - Oh, hello, Danny. - Hello, Laura. I was just taking a walk. And so I thought maybe  Well, nobody around here ever gets to see her or anything. So I came in to find out myself about the witch. What witch? In there. That's just Mrs. Minnett who lives in there, Danny. And you know it. I'm calling on her myself. You don't think I'd go calling on a witch, do you? Well, everyone says that she is. Well, I'm afraid you're just a couple hundred years too late for witches. I guess I'm a couple hundred years too late for anything. Well, I wouldn't worry about it. I think something will turn up. - You really think so? - Mmm-hmm. Taxi! Here, Uncle John. My Uncle John calls me Taxi. So excuse me, will you? I've gotta catch my fare. Who were you talking to, Danny? Oh. This is my Uncle John. This is Miss. Pennington. I'm John Hillgrove. How do you do? I hope that Danny hasn't been up to anything heshouldn't have been up to. Not a thing. I'm staying in the village for a while with Dr. Stanton, my brother-in-law. And when Danny and I take a walk, it's frequently a little confusing as to who's responsible for whom. Uncle John's a great piano player. He plays the piano. It would be nice, Danny, with your enthusiasm, if you were a paying audience. Goodbye, Miss Pennington.. Nice to have met you. Thank you. Goodbye, Mr. Hillgrove. Your friend Miss Pennington has a very pleasant voice. Yeah, but there's this you don't know, Uncle John. She's terrible homely. That's not nice, Danny. Don't you always say to me that I should tell the truth? And doesn't Mom? It doesn't Pop? You just can't please people. There's a time and place, even for the truth, Danny. If you say so, Uncle John. But she is homely. 'm Laura Pennington, Mrs. Minnett. My landlady said you wanted to see me. Come in. You can take off your wraps and lay them there. I'll bring some tea. How do you like your tea? One lump, please. No milk. I understand you're looking for a job? Yes, I am. I suppose I'm really looking for a home. I need a young woman to help me. Someone who doesn't cling to the foolish belief that this cottage is  What do you think of this cottage? Why, it's it's  It's not haunted. You know that, don't you? It's not haunted. Well, I'm sure when people say haunted, they don't really mean it. So you're not superstitious. That's good. You just came back to Eastwood a few weeks ago, didn't you? Early in November. Things didn't work out with your mother's cousin in Vermont. There wasn't enough for her and her family, let alone  Some men are meant to be wanderers. Others, it's no good for them to go looking for things. How long since you've been away? Seven years? Nearly eight. When my mother died, there wasn't anybody left here that I belonged to. I thought when you went away, you'd come back. I hope here where I grew up, I might find  Well, I, uh, really don't know what I was I wanted find. A place I belonged, I guess. A place that when I woke up in the morning, I'd be glad it was another day. And when I went to sleep, I'd felt like it meant something to have been awake. I've rented the cottage. And I need somebody to help me with the work. The people are coming again today to look at it. They wanted for several months with a housekeeper and maid. That'd be us. Well, if you want me, I'd be glad to. Your work won't be hard. You'll get your room and board. And the regular wages. That's quite satisfactory. Then we better get started. They'll be here directly. You can get your things later. There isn't very much to get, really. These people who're renting the cottage, are they a honeymoon couple? Didn't ask. I was hoping you were going to renew the old tradition, Mrs. Minnett. What old tradition? The one about this cottage. How for over a century, it was rented to honeymooners. That tradition was broken. I broke it. Oh! This cottage was deeded to my husband as a wedding present. It was too have been our home. Tom's and mine. Only I've had to live on here alone. Nearly 25 years. Do you know what loneliness is? Real loneliness. - Yes - I thought you might. That's why, when I heard that you'd come back  They're here. You open the door for them. Come in. Hello? Anybody home? Come in, please. I hope I'm not too early, Mrs. Minnett. I brought Miss  Oh, I'm sorry. This is not Mrs. Minnett, darling. I'm Oliver Bradford. I stopped by last week and persuaded Mrs. Minnett to read her cottage to us. Yes I know. I'm Laura Pennington. - Hello, Mrs. Minnett. - Good afternoon. This is Miss Alexander, Mrs. Minnett. How do you do, Mrs. Minnett? - And is must be  - The maid, oh, yes. - Is there a dining room? - No. I thought we could dine by the fire, dear. Oh. - Would you like to see the upstairs? - Thank you. I'll stay here, dear. I've already seen it. All right, Oliver. My mother warned me that men are never interested in the practical side of housekeeping. It's a law. Hmm. What an odd pattern. Does this belong to the old boy who first built the place? It was his family crest. The chain symbolizes the new country he adopted. The first 15 American states. What a charming idea  for an Englishman. Hey, this is really an old goblet, isn't it? You can't even read the inscription. Was this the old boy's too? No, that was given to the favorite son and his wife. They drank a toast from it on their wedding night. Just the two of them killed this? Well, so the story goes. Well, I bet they didn't need a candle to light their way to bed. All this was in the old house, hmm? No. The old house burned down shortly after it was built. That was over a century ago. This wing was all that was saved. The sun was the first to live here with his young bride. When you had a cocktail in those days, you weren't kidding. You must have been here quite a while with Mrs. Minnett? No, I just came this morning. But you know so much about the cottage. Well, I was born in the village and lived there for years. When I was a little girl, I heard all the stories there were about the cottage. It was like like living in a fairy tale. Every day you could walk by and see where all the stories happened. Next thing, you'll be telling me it's haunted. Oh, no, it's not haunted. But it is enchanted. It comes to the same thing, doesn't it? Oh, no, haunted. That's to be restless. Uneasy. Afraid. It's ugly. Enchanted, that's to be happy and gay. And beauty. You see, all people who lived here loved one another. Look. Here are their names. Young men and young women who in this very room swore to love one another... always. "Evangeline and Clement, 1844." "Judith and Richard, 1790." There are all a part of this place now. Forever and ever. Do you really believe all this, don't you? Well? Darling, this was your idea. After all, you know my tastes. You'd say they were prosaic. Oh, now, darling. As the outstanding example of your tastes Well, I admit it's all very charming. Charming? It's much more than that. It's enchanted. Isn't it enchanted, Miss uh...? I just received a personal guarantee. If we spend our honeymoon here, we'll live happily ever after. Mr. Bradford stumbles onto your cottage, Mrs. Minnett. He's fascinated by it. It exerts its charm and persuades you to rent it to him. What can I say? You made your important mistake when you said "yes" to me. Miss Alexander is delighted at the prospect of spending her honeymoon in your cottage. There are a few routine questions I've got to ask, of course. My dear Mrs. Minnett. I filled out so many forms in the past few weeks, I can tell you anything you want to know about myself. With photostatic copies. Mr. Bradford means he's applied for a commission in the Army Air Corps. He's a flier. Oh. Well, don't worry. The Army isn't my sole means of support. I'm really a very good risk, in spite of the uncertainty of my profession. Oh, really, Oliver. At any rate, I brought a check for the first two months rent. No, thank you. Later will do? Better take it now. We'll be here at least three months. It'll take that long to get my commission. It may be sooner than you think. My commission? Not a chance. Army red tape and all that. They tell me down in Washington  Oliver. Oh, all right, darling. We'll show up on Tuesday, Mrs. Minnett, and I hope that  Dear, let me have your ring, will you? My ring? Now that were gonna settle down here for a bit, I think we ought to keep up all the old traditions.. What are you talking about? Just give me your ring. And I'll show you. Oh, Oliver! I'm sorry. What are you trying to do anyway? Oh, thank you. I'll explain later. I'm afraid you should have used this. Oh. Oh. I'll have it reset for you, darling. I suppose if I were superstitious, I regard this as a warning that we shouldn't be married at all. You're not married yet. Thats why. Only honeymoon couples may write their name in that window. Very well, Mrs. Minnett. Please put us down for reservation on that cottage. We're going to be married Tuesday. - Bye. - Bye. Goodbye Miss uh... Pennington. Be sure and dust off that goblet for us. Why, your calendar is way off, Mrs. Minnett. Let me see... Today is December 7th, '41. April 6, 1917. Why, you're just 24 years, 8 months... And one day off-schedule. It may be sooner than you think. You've got exactly 35 minutes, Ollie. Thank you, Freddie. But don't worry. I won't be late for the war. Your stepfather isn't worried you'll be late to the war, Oliver. I know, Mother. I was just trying to be funny. I don't see anything funny about it. If you ask me, I've never encountered anything more inconsiderate. I can't imagine what the War Department was thinking about. It's telling you to report in Washington the very day you were supposed to be married. That's the way war is, Violet. You give no quarter. You get no quarter. I can remember back in '17  You'd think people would learn better in 25 years! Oh, it's simply ridiculous, Oliver. They can't expect you to be uprooted as if you were an ordinary garden vegetable. It wouldn't make much difference, mother, if I were a rare and exotic hothouse fruit. There's a war on. Whoever heard of starting a war in December? Oh, dear! When I think of all the parties we had planned for you and Beatrice. We'll have them all when he comes back, dear. And when I think of the people that I didn't invite to the wedding. They're all my enemies now. And we're not even going to have a wedding. Oh, dear! Aren't you going to take along this nice warm sweater I knitted for you, Oliver? Well, it's not regulation, mother. Who says what's regulation and what isn't. That's what I'd like to know. The Army does, mother. Darling, will you stick these papers in the briefcase for me? Suppose you had been home with the telegram came? Good thing I was, I'd say. Looks like I'm really in on this deal. - I guess that's everything, Oliver. - Okay. I'll close it, dear. Oh, I just remembered. We were going to do about all those wedding presents? Send them back. For the duration. You can send things back for the duration. At least I won't have to write all those thank-you notes. I will, at that, won't I? Without being able to keep the presents. Have you got everything you want in this briefcase? I think so, dear. No bachelor dinner in either. That's really gonna be too bad. I can remember in my bachelor dinner  Well, when you get back. Yes, Freddie. When I get back. We better get going, dear. I still don't see why we can't go to the air field with you. Now, darling. We've been over all that. Hail and farewell at home. They're always so messy at the field. Here I am shedding tears. And I was going to be so brave. Oh! This is for you, Oliver. It belonged to your father. - St. Christopher, isn't it? - Yes. It took your father safely all through the last war, darling. Poor David! He went through all that ghastly business without a scratch Only to die in New York City of Spanish influenza. Thank you, mother. Thanks a lot. It was very sweet of you to think of it. Hmm. Uh. Goodbye. Goodbye, Freddie. Take good care of my mother, won't you? Of course, my boy. Of course. Been doing it since you were a little shaver, haven't I? - Come on, darling. - Right with you. Goodbye. Thanks for everything. - Bless you, mother. - Goodbye, Oliver. Now, Vi, what are you crying for? You just invite the people you didn't invite to the wedding to dinner. It'll be just as if nothing had happened. I promise you. It's been like that for as long as I can remember. Mother and Freddie and myself. It's never easy saying goodbye. Not that mother isnt kind and gentle. Or doesn't mean well. Or that we don't love each other. It's just that we can never talk to each other about anything important. We always seem to go past each other from the very beginning. As for Freddie, he never forgets what time it is. And that's that. I love you very much. You know that, don't you? Do you? You mean this war isn't just a great big excuse you cooked up... to get out of marrying me? Nuh-uh. Don't forget. You and I decided to be two of the smart ones. None of this "married on Tuesday, parted on Wednesday" "see you after the war is over" business for us. We are modern, intelligent lovers, aren't we? Yes, darling. We certainly are. Oh, that reminds me. Send this check to that woman at the cottage, Mrs. Minnett. And explain why we didn't come. I'll tell her that we're modern and intelligent and... No, I'll just let her guess. "My dear Mrs. Minnett, "I do hope that sudden change in our plans "will not inconvenience you too greatly. "Mr. Bradford has received his commission and... "already reported for special duty. "That means, of course, that we shan't be renting your cottage. "But I am enclosing a check, which I trust will compensate "in some small way for all the trouble we have caused you. "Beatrice Alexander." Well, you won't be needing me now, Mrs. Minnett. I better be going to get my things together. You're welcome to stay. Oh, I couldn't. Not if I can't be of some help. You can be of help. You mean you're going to rent the cottage again? When the time comes. Tell me. Isn't it a little early to be starting your planting? That's why I put the garden in the shelter of the wall. Get two or three weeks extra that way. I start work at the canteen next week. Are you sure that's what you want to do? Well, I want to do something. I wonder whatever happened to them. To whom? That young flier and his girl. They were so in love. I hope they did get married, before he went away. You poor darling. You haven't been at that sink all evening, have you? Oh, my hair! Isn't it a fright? I don't know how you can keep looking so neat, Miss Pennington.. They say you don't go in for all this modern dancing, do you? No, I don't. Personally, if I'd spent the last six months washing dishes, washing dishes and washing dishes, I'd  Oh, well, I suppose everyone does what they're best suited for, don't you? Some of the most gorgeous sailors and Marines you ever saw just came in It's the best Halloween party we ever had. Well, it's the first Halloween party we ever had, if you want to get technical. But after all... You should be out there having a good time too. No, thank you. Now now now. Turnabout and fair play. And all that. I insist! Mildred! You'll have a wonderful time. You will, really! I'd rather stay here. Some of those boys are really out of this world. And I must say, whoever designed the uniforms for this war was certainly cooking on the front burner. Mildred, dear, you don't mind relieving Miss Pennington so she can come out and join in the fun a while, do you, dear? You're the chief, Annette. - Come along. Dry your hands! - Really, Mrs. Wainwaring. Miss Pennington, you have your orders. That's the way to serve the troops. Bye, Mildred. There's just the cutest bunch of boys. I can't imagine where do they keep them between wars. Have a good time, dear. Attention, everybody. Attention. Over there in that corner. You too, you great big Marine you. I hope you'll pardon my slang. But a lot of youse have been much too aloof. And I do mean aloof. And I do mean youse. That's why this text dance is for everybody to get acquainted. Everybody! A Paul Jones. If you don't know how to do it, just watch your neighbor. Come on now! Everybody, get themselves a girl! Music, professor! Excuse me. All join hands. Circle to the right! Let's keep going with all our might! Forward and back! With a big yippee! Oh, do it again. Do it again! Do it again! Yay! Yay! Now grand right and left! Boys to the right. Girls to the left! Right right! Left left! Right right! Left left! Everybody dance! Pick up those who are lonely. Don't let them stand by themselves. Once more! All join hands. Circle to the right! Now! Forward and back! With a big yippee! Yay! Yippee! Oh, do it again! Do it again! Do it again! Yay! Yippee! Once more. Do it again! Do it again! Do it again! Yay! Yay! Everybody dance! All join hands. And circle to the right! And keep on going with all our might! Forward and back! With a big yippee! Yay! Yippee! Yay! Everybody, dance! Laura. It's not for some of us  for you and for me  to try to live like other people. We think we can sometimes. But there's always the world to remind us. All the things that other people take for granted. You've got to make up your mind that in your heart, they're not for you. You've got to find something else to take their place. Somewhere where you're safe. Where no one can hurt you. That's why I wanted you to be here. Because there's something here for you that  that there isn't anywhere else. You understand? Someone's coming. Thank you. You got to sign for it. Come close to forgetting about it, didn't we? "Would like cottage for indefinite period. Arriving today. "Oliver Bradford." Bradford! That was his name! So they did get married, after all. Imagine they're remembering the cottage all this time. Why, it's been over a year! Mrs. Minnett, there is something about this cottage. There is indeed. It needs a good cleaning. Right now. It's a taxi. I'll go to the door. They'll want something hot to drink. I'll make some tea. Did you get my telegram? Yes I like to go right to my room, if you don't mind. I'll take that. Mr. Bradford came alone. I'll unpack his things. We've been here exactly one hour and 14 minutes. And what good has it done us? I 'd like to know. Why, the boy won't even talk to us. Maybe Mrs. Price  Now, if he won't talk to me, he wont talk to anybody. Of course he is pretty badly bashed up. But I've told him a hundred times, there's no use becoming a mental case over a little injury. He ought to realize there are thousands of cases worse than his. Maybe if we let them alone. We let him think things out. No, he's always been stubborn. When he was a little boy, I can remember, there were simply no reason for him to run away from home. None at all. No luck, I bet. I told you so. Couldn't I fix you some tea? There's some fresh hot water. Oh, thank heavens, tea. I love a cup, dear. He won't unlock the door. He told me to go away. We might just as well go home. We've done our best. And after all, when you've done your best, you've done your best. Just finding this forsaken hole was enough. How in heavens name, Beatrice, did you ever remember to think of it? This is where Oliver and I were going to spend our honeymoon Honeymoon? Hasn't even got a bar. Here's your tea. Oh, you're such a consolation, darling. What did Oliver say to you when he did talk to you? He wasn't he wasn't very nice. I even cried a little. I'm afraid he's just like his father. Beyond all persuasion. Look here, Vi. I got an idea. What say we leave him up here for a bit? Seems to me, we've got no choice. A few weeks of living here with himself. And I'll wager you he'll appreciate a little friendly society. Beatrice, what ever happened between you and Oliver? Between us? Yes, something did happen, didn't it? Did you quarrel? Is that why he ran away and came up here? No, we didn't quarrel. Then why don't you go upstairs and talk to him? If there's anyone who can persuade him to leave this dreadful place and come home, it's you. I couldn't? But you're our only hope. I wish you wouldn't ask me. If you fail, we'll give up and go home. But first we've got to know  you've got to know. That you've tried your best. After all, you and he were going to be married. I was getting out of his life so that you  Oh, please try, Beatrice. Please! Oh, bless you, darling. And remember, you must be brave. That's so important. We must all be brave. Oliver. Please answer. It's Beatrice. Won't you speak to me? Won't you, please? I meant what I said the other day. We can be married. We can be married right away. I'll look after you and  I'll try to make you a good wife. Oh, why did we have to have this horrible war? You see, Oliver, that first day when you came home No one had told me. And would you turned and looked at me, I wasn't prepared. That's why you thought I I can't help it if I'm weak. Aren't you listening? Won't you speak to me? I tried to be brave about it. Really I did. I did try. Oh! Yes? I brought you some supper, Mr. Bradford. Your mother left this for you. Thank you. I'm afraid she was awfully upset when she left this afternoon. Will you please mind your own business? I'm sorry. That was very rude of me. Don't you understand? You think I want people to see me the way I am? You saw me before? Doesn't the change shock you? Isn't it repulsive to you? No. Well, you can't know. You can't realize what it is to face life like this. Ugly and  Your supper, Mr. Bradford. Mrs. Minnett's is a very good cook. Thank you. Good morning. What's that you're doing? Wood engraving. It looks as if you're pretty good at it. I work on them every spare moment I can get. I went to an exhibit of block prints once in Boston. From Holbein. That's what started me. I realize they take patience and time. Well, I have a lot of both. Of course, I'll never be any serious competition to Mr. Holbein. Huh. Did you ever do anything with your prints? I mean, show them to anybody? Well, I entered some in an exhibit once. Some seascapes. And I won a prize. It wasn't first prize but  It was a prize. I used to win prices too. Tennis. Polo. I once knew a fellow who used to make ship models in glass bottles. I always asked him to tell me why. I never got a satisfactory answer. Well I do block prints because  Well, I like to do block prints. Un-huh. It makes sense. He used to say with him it was because it had a resemblance to life. If you look at it largely. All of us one way or the other are full master schooners. Or brigantines. Whaling ships. Or even canoes. Ready to sail into life. Only there we were. Locked up in glass bottles. You just like to make them, huh? I never thought of that. Bet he never did either. It's a matter of finding something you like. Sure, sure. You'll find a hobby of your own one of these days. I hope. Be careful. You don't want to sound like Freddie, do you? Well, from the way you say it, I'm sure I don't. And I don't even know who Freddie is. That's the best thing that can happen to anybody. Not to know who Freddie is. In case you think I'm not making any sense, that's what I think too. Well, I know what you mean. Even if I don't understand how you're trying to say it. You know, you are a very kind person. I didn't know. You got a lot of sense too. You'd be amazed to know how few people have any. Beg pardon, ma'am. My uncle and I have come to call on Mr. Bradford. It's Mrs. Minnett, isn't it? I'm visiting in the neighborhood. And when I heard that Mr. Bradford was here  Mr. Bradford hasn't been seeing anyone. Oh. I'm leaving in a few days on a short tour. And I had hoped  I bet you he'd like to see my uncle, Mrs. Minnett. He plays the piano. He's very good. My public. I'm sorry but Mr. Bradford has told me he doesn't care to see anyone. Well, I'd be the last to quarrel with people who want to be by themselves. Tell him I called, would you please? Come along, Danny. Just a minute. I'll find out. Maybe Mr. Bradford will see you. Come in and wait. Thank you, Mrs. Minnett. Wait right here for us, Roger. Sit down in there, please. What do you know, Uncle John. She's got a piano. People have pianos, Danny. Yeah. But this one is so old and funny-looking. - Gee! - What's the matter? It's kind of spooky in here. See what I mean. It's only Roger. You better go out and play with him. He'll scare everybody. - Well. - I'll call you when I want you. Okay. I'll be down at the shore, Uncle John. Yes. I knew this cottage would have a piano. - Good morning, Mr. Hillgrove. - Good morning. Please, don't get up. It's Laura Pennington. Of course. We met outside this cottage, let me see... Nearly a year and a half ago, when I first came to live here. I'm calling to see Mr. Bradford. Mrs Minnett has just gone to tell him. I'm glad you came. He needs friends, sympathetic friends. Don't go. You know... This is a real adventure for me. Today is the first time I've been inside this cottage. I must've walked by it a hundred times. It has a strange fascination. Indeed, it has. You can see things, you get to have certain feelings about them. I know what you mean. Particularly about this cottage. Do you? Because somehow I  Well, my main feeling is, that if I got to know it  To know what it's about, it would be more than just a cottage. It has a life of its own to me. And everything connected to it. Mrs. Minnett, for instance. I wonder about her. When she first came here, she came as a bride. But her husband was killed in the last war. Time seemed to stop for her. The day her husband went away. She's been drawn to the past. Well, perhaps that's one way to know the future. Let me take you to Mr. Bradford, Mr. Hillgrove. I just left him in the garden. Thank you. Mr. Bradford. This is Mr. Hillgrove. He's come to see you. Oh? Forgive me for intruding this way. But my brother-in-law Dr. Stanton suggested that since we are neighbors, we might also be friends. I'm not very good at friendship. Or anything else, these days. A sick man, are you? Don't I look like one? I would know. I can't see. Oh, I'm sorry. Perhaps you'd like to sit down. Thank you. Yes, got mine in the last war. Came down in flames over the Argonne. My brother-in-law tells me you're a flier too. It was. I got mine over Java. You're young.. You'll mend. You can't see me. So you don't know how I look. There's nothing left of me but nerves. Nothing  Go right ahead. Complain all you want if it makes you feel better. Apparently, you don't complain. You haven't given me a chance. I'd like to ask you something if you don't mind. How in the name of heaven have you stood it all these years? Being blind? By cultivating other senses. It's a fascinating game. It opens new worlds to you. How? Well... In place of these two eyes that are gone, I have a hundred invisible ones that see things as they really are. The other senses come to your aid. Touch, smell, sound. There comes a heightening of perception. A sort of... sensitivity to all living things. For instance, nature's more beautiful than I knew it. And human beings are more understandable. Sometimes I feel it was before the Argonne that I was blind. It's only now that I see. I don't believe you. That's just a lot of words. Oh, maybe you kidded yourself into thinking it's true. Maybe for you it is true. But it'd never work for me. Why not? Because I still want the same things I wanted when I was strong and healthy. In the hospital, I used to sit by my window where I could see some kids playing tennis. I watch them for a while. Until I just couldn't stand it. I batted my head against many a wall, just the way you're doing. As a matter of fact, I was lost until I found music. And then, a whole new life opened up for me. I don't know one note from another. You will find something. But how? Where shall I look? You've got to have faith in yourself. You're a person. You're not just a case. You're a complete individual. Remember that. You're like the man who's come across a place in the road where it branches off into many little side paths. You don't want to go ahead. You want to go back. You're confused. You don't trust yourself. Why should I? How can I trust myself? You must. Some people find new talents within themselves. As I did. Others find new friends. And through them, a new life. Well, I... mustn't overstay my first visit. I'll call my young nephew. I believe he's waiting down by the shore. Let me walk down with you. Fine. I'd like to. It's the first time I really felt like walking. He's a silly old dog. No more'n I throw a stick out in the ocean, he beats it out and brings it back every time. Maybe he thinks you're a silly old boy. No more'n he brings the stick back, you throw it out again every time. - You can throw at if you want to. - Thank you, Johnny. Taxi! Coming, Uncle John. - Goodbye, Miss Pennington. - Goodbye, Danny. It was nice to see you, Mr. Bradford. And have our little talk. Thanks. - I wish you'd drop in again. Soon. - Glad to. - I am here, uncle. - This is Mr. Bradford, Danny. Hello, Danny. Sorry you have to shake my left hand. Mr. Bradford is an army pilot. He was shot down over Java. Gee. We better be getting home, Danny. Okay, Uncle John. Welcome to our ocean, Mr. Bradford. You're right. I haven't been taking advantage of Eastwood's scenic attractions, have I? I thought you had something against oceans. No, it's just that I haven't felt like walking. But I do now, if you don't mind. I was just in the midst of gathering some driftwood when I met Danny. How would that be as a hobby for me? Driftwood gatherer? It wouldn't be too practical. A hobby should serve any particular purpose really. Hobbies for hobby's sake. It's supposed to be. Well, maybe I could set a new style in hobbies. Has actually been three weeks since you introduced me to the wonders of your seashore? Yes. To think, I didn't know the difference between starfish and star sapphire. If you were in doubt, any fishermen would've told it. Or any jeweler. Surprise, Mrs. Minnett. We brought you some more driftwood. Thanks. That makes enough for For a dozen winters, huh? Well, we can always use it. It's probably never been done before. But I could gather up all this driftwood and take it back to the shore. Isn't it wonderful the way he's changed. Mr. Bradford, don't you think it'd be nice if we had our tea in the garden this afternoon? I don't care where you have it. Oh, Miss Pennington. I wish you would tell Mr. Hillgrove when he comes is afternoon that  I won't be able to see him today. Mr. Bradford. I saw you leave the house. And I thought you might not want to be alone. You might want to talk to somebody. These past few weeks, I had an idea that the walks we took and talking to me... I hope I was being of some help to you. And so I thought if you need help now  That letter this afternoon was from my mother. I seem to remember you saw me once before when I had a letter from my mother. And a little bit before that, when she paid me the honor of a personal visit. In fact, if it hadn't been for you  You weren't yourself that day, Mr. Bradford. It was me. It's only what I try to pretend that I'm not me that  They've come to a decision, my mother and stepfather. It isn't good for me to be alone. To be in a position where I brood too much. So they've given me my choice. I can come home and have the benefit of their loving care and attention 24 hours a day. Or they're prepared to make the extreme sacrifice. Close up the house at Bar Harbor. And come here to live with me. They even want to know if they should bring a trained nurse with them. They can't do that. Just from what you've told me, nothing could do you you more harm than to  There's no way to make them understand. You understand. Because you're thoughtful and kind. Don't be startled by what I'm going to say to you. Will you marry me? I had no idea I was going to ask you that. But I'm glad I did. Will you believe that the very asking makes me realize I've been thinking about it for some time? And I mean it, with all my heart. If you want to marry to get rid of your family, there must be dozens of girls who'd suit your purpose better than I would. You think I have such a great choice? A hideous casualty for the rest of my life. I understand. I get the chance because I  Oh, I'm such a fool. I wouldn't hurt you for anything in the world. It isn't as if I weren't aware of my ugliness. There's only one thing you've overlooked. Women like me  Conscious as we may be of our defects  we find a refuge in our dreams. Daydreams as well as night dreams. Merciful dreams in which we're as lovely and desirable as loveliest and most desirable women in the world. It's cruel to destroy those dreams. I only felt that no woman in the world would marry me except out of compassion. I know you have a lot of that. You know how desperate I get at times. But I promise I try not to be too much of a burden to you. If I felt a black spell coming on, I'd go and stay in my room until it passed. But with you, I wouldn't have them often. Because I like being with you. I like to hear the sound of your voice. Your laughter. I know I'm not offering you much. We'd be together. Thats so much better than being alone. I don't like being alone either but  I don't want to be your wife just because you need a woman. And I happen to be here. Don't you see? Yes, I see. I see you couldn't possibly care enough. But I do care. That's the reason. Bless you, Laura. Bless you forever and ever. I want to change the modulation that leads into the theme. - Well, if you're all unpacked, John. - Thank you, Harriet. We haven't had a moment to talk. Tell me, how was your tour? Well, I found some good tobacco. But all those towns. And all those audiences. I do believe you're really glad to be back with us again. Mom! Uncle John! I'm here. In here, Danny, in your uncle's room. I really think I missed the kid most of all. - Hello, Uncle John! - Hello there. I was wondering where you were. It's way past your bedtime. Can't I stay up a little bit longer? Just a little bit. I want to talk to uncle John. What's that you got? Oh, it's letter for you, Uncle John. That old Mrs. Minnett gave it to me when I was passing the cottage. He said it was from Mr. Bradford and Miss Pennington. I mean Mrs. Bradford. So? Suppose we see what's in it. Go on, Danny. What have the newlyweds got to say? It just says "something extraordinary has happened." "Laura and I need your advice. "Please come to see us as soon as you arrive... Oliver." That's all. What time is it now? It's almost 9. Do you think this could wait until morning? It sounds urgent. I'll take you over to the cottage, Uncle John. No, young fella. It's bedtime for you. I'll take your regular taxi. One with four wheels and a motor. - Come back for me at 10, will you? - Yes, sir. Tell me, what kind of night it is? Clear as a bell, sir. - Mrs. Minnett, isn't it? - Come in, Mr. Hillgrove. Thank you. Where are Mr. and Mrs. Bradford? Out for a walk. I haven't seen them since the wedding. Everything's all right, I hope. Oh, yes. What's happened to this room? It feels different to me somehow. The flowers maybe. No no no. It's more than that. Tonight I got rather an odd note. Tell me, Mrs. Minnett. What's happened to our young couple that so extraordinary? I can't tell you. If they go away on a honeymoon? They're spending it right here in the cottage. You'll be the first person they seen since their marriage, except me. As they see no more of me than they can help. Well, I'm flattered. You should be because... - Actually, they're in hiding. - What? Oh, honeymoon shyness, huh? They keep to themselves all day. And when they do go out at night, they wrap themselves up and cover their faces. Mr. Hillgrove is in the living room. Oh, good. - John! - Hello, John! It's so good to see you again. I think we should have died if we had to wait much longer. What is this about? Tell me, what is the mystery? It may sound insane. But we sent for you because you're the only one we can trust. We don't really know how to explain it. It's fantastic. Oh, Oliver, let me. Not that I'm very articulate about it but  Well, it all has to do with this cottage. I think you know my feeling about it. It's the same as yours. Sit down, John. There's something strange about it. Something  What does it have to do with you and Oliver? What is this thing that happened to you? When I got your note  It's pretty incredible. John, we've changed. Changed completely. It's true. We're no longer as we were. I can tell that from your voices. You feel different because you are happy. It's more than that. It's a physical change. When did you first notice this... transformation? The day we were married. We came home. When we said goodbye to you after the ceremony. Oliver and I sat for a while in the chapel before we returned home. Later that night, when we were finishing dinner... Our wedding dinner. Mrs. Minnett removed the cake from the table and left the room. We were alone. I had never even for a moment tried to pretend to myself... that my marriage to Laura was anything but out-and-out selfishness on my part. The last barrier between me... and the world I was afraid to face. Oh, I had made up all kinds of arguments. Like the things I said to Laura the night I proposed. But I knew they were half-truths at best. They were all because I didn't want to be alone. Because I could get this or that benefit out of it. Because I  All at once I felt how shabby what I had done must seem to her. My trying to palm off a broken, bitter shell of a man. On a woman who was genuine and honest. But there was nothing I could say. He was my husband. But he could never know how much he meant to me, That I've loved him since the first day he came to the cottage. I would never be able to tell him all that was in my heart. For he could never love me as I loved him. It was a farce, our marriage. A tragic farce. I was desperate. I wondered if I could make him understand. As you would understand, John. Through music. The very first notes I struck were like the touch of a magic wand. I could feel the room changing. There was a new warmth. A new radiance. And as I played, the feeling of enchantment spread, embracing everything about me. I turned and looked at Oliver. He was just as I saw him first. That day in December. It was everything I had ever dreamed of. Suddenly I thought... How could I fool myself that I could be the bride of such a man as this? I had to run away from him because I couldn't let him see my tears. When Laura ran from the room, I knew how cruelly she'd been hurt. I felt I must tell her. I would release her from this horrible mockery her marriage had become. In all fairness, it seemed the only solution. And then I remembered all her gentle kindnesses. The thousand and one ways she had lightened my loneliness. Suddenly I realized how much she'd come to mean to me. I took her in my arms to tell her. She was beautiful. More beautiful to me than anyone I'd ever known. That was when we knew. Yes, we knew. But it's all so bewildering. Suddenly, I'm afraid. I can't help it I'm afraid. Why, Laura? It's all mixed up with what she's trying to tell you about the cottage. It is this cottage. What do you mean, actually about the cottage? The houses are like living beings. Alive with all the thoughts and memories of the people who've lived in them. Those thoughts and memories go on living as long as the house stands. Yes, I think I understand. I'm afraid it's some kind of trick. You see. The lovers who came here before were not like us. Ours was a marriage of convenience. They may think that we've profaned their memory. And this may be their revenge  Letting us have happiness for a moment before taking it away. You know, John. I couldn't stand to be ugly again. For Oliver. Oh, my darling. Well, John, what do you think? She knows. She never looks at us. But she knows about the change. Laura, Oliver. Yes, John? You asked me what I think  well, it's this. Take this gift and enjoy it. Without question without fear. Accept it humbly  as a heavenly sent miracle. And be grateful for it. A miracle? Don't either of you believe in miracles? Modern miracles that may happen to you or me today, tomorrow? You've both been touched by a power that is beyond this world. Accept your blessing. Don't tell anyone about it. It belongs to you. You are a friend. John, I I... That'd be the cab driver. I told him to come back for me. Just a minute. We're so grateful for your kindness. Good night, Laura. - Homer? - Here I am, sir. Thank you. - Good night. - Good night. Good night, John. And thanks. Oh, Oliver, I love you so. Sweet dreams, Evangeline and Clement. Mary Ellen and Malcolm. And all of you. I do hope you consider us worthy to join you. I have the strangest feeling. Almost as if these walls were breathing. The air all around, throbbing like a pulse. All the memories and ghosts of love. Live. Live live they seem to say. This is our day and our night. All our enchanted life to be lived now. Laura. My love. I worship you. I adore you. I have a feeling you're a little mad. It's a kind of midsummer madness. It's contagious. That's what's nice about it. - Listen. - What? The song I hear. The melody that whispers all through this enchanted room. What does it say the song you hear? I love you, Laura. That's what it says. The song I hear. I can't make up my mind whether you're more beautiful awake or asleep. I'm dreaming. Well, tell me about it. What's happening? Mmm! I had the most wonderful wedding. The bride was wearing a beautiful white satin wedding gown. A pearl necklace... and Isn't anyone paying any attention to the groom? Oh yes. He's the best part of the wedding. Everybody says so. Mmm, he's positively stunning. Darling, you don't say stunning about a man. You say  Dashing! Because you are. And handsome  because you're that too. All the other girls are so jealous of the bride. You'd think they'd know how to hide their feelings. But they don't. You don't seem very upset about it. Oh, no. After all, it's only a dream. That was no dream. Oliver. Hmm? They're very much in love. Frankly, I'm delighted they're coming. I'm only sorry I didn't make the gesture myself. But  Feeling the way they did, we just couldn't invite them to the wedding. And I don't want mother to feel  I have a perfectly dreadful reason for being glad they're coming back. Of course, I want them to see how happy we are  and to share in our happiness but Well, but, most of all, I I wanted to see that Oliver didn't do too badly marrying me. And I have the most exciting new dress for the occasion. Oh, wait until you see it, Oliver. Perhaps I better do something about that too. You don't want to steal the whole show, do you? Yes! Oh, there won't be time now. That's their car just turning off the highway. They'll be here in a few minutes. But I don't want to meet them looking like this. It's so typical of mother not to give us any more warning. See here. Go ahead, you two. I'll entertain your mother and stepfather, Oliver. Oh, will you, John? You're a darling! Don't be long, Oliver. It's rather an imposition. Are you sure you don't mind? Not at all. In fact, I'm particularly glad for the opportunity. Mrs. Minnett. Yes? Do you suppose you could have an especially fine tea this afternoon? Mr. and Mrs. Price are coming to call. That's what the telegram was about. What's the matter, Mrs. Minnett? Oh, don't be upset about it. We're very pleased they're coming. Are you all right, Mrs. Minnett? Yes. I'm all right. Mrs. Minnett? Yes, Mr. Hillgrove? Please don't call Mr. and Mrs. Bradford yet. Let me have a talk with Mr. and Mrs. Price first. - Understand? - I understand. Good afternoon, Mrs. Minnett. You see, Freddie. I did remember the name. It's so nice to see you again. Same dreary little place. - Frederic! - Oh. Charming room, isn't it? Ohh. Will you go in and sit down, please? How are you, Mr...? Hillgrove's the name. How do you know us? Oops, sorry. I'm a friend of Oliver and Laura. Won't you sit down, please? Oh, thank you. Where is Oliver, Mr. Hillgrove? He and Laura are upstairs. I said I'd talk to you till they've changed. I'm glad of the opportunity because I thought it was important to. explain something to you that  Oh. He doesn't want to see us, is that it? They do want to see you. Both of them. Very much. It's just that I  How shall I put it? Perhaps if I  I don't know if you've ever heard it  But there's an old legend about some people  who lived in a city of eternal night. They were blind all of them. As I am blind. The city was in ruins. But they saw it not as a fallen citadel. But as a great and beautiful dwelling place. Greater and more beautiful than it had ever been. That was because... they looked upon their city not with their eyes. But with a truer sight of the heart. Well, it's very charming parable, Mr. Hillgrove. But I must confess I fail to see  Oliver and Laura. Something extraordinary has happened to them. They're different people. Different? How? There on the borderland of the greatest happiness they've ever experienced. But they've changed changed greatly. And I know that that changes they see it is... is not as you will see it. I'm afraid I really don't  You're talking in riddles, Hillgrove. Suppose I put it this way. When you see them come down those stairs, whatever they do whatever they say, act along with them. They don't know it. But they're playing a part. Play a part with them. Pretend that the change is as great as they imagine it to be. Change? What change? Oliver isn't well. You're trying to break it to me gently. That's it, isn't it? No, that isn't it. Oliver, Laura... Oh, Freddie. We should have swallowed our pride and come up here long ago. Oliver needs us. In time to come, when they're ready to face the world, they will of found out the truth for themselves. But now today  Believe me, Mrs. Price. It will be actually better if you went away without even seeing him. Mr. Hillgrove, you can't mean that. You're not suggesting that a mother should desert her only son at a time like this? Where is Oliver? - Oliver! - Please, Mrs. Price. Oliver! Oliver! Will be right down, mother. Please remember that the next few minutes may be the most important in their lives. You hold their chance for happiness in your hands. Well... - Oh, Ollie! - Mother. Oh. Mother. You know Laura, don't you? I'm so glad you've come to see us, Mrs. Price. How do you do? Of course, you've met Freddie, haven't you? - Oh, yes. Yes. We've met. - Mr Price. When we got your wire, it seemed to add just the note we wanted. Well... Won't you sit down? Mrs. Minnett has prepared a lovely tea for us. Wait until you've tasted her scones. I I tried to make myself. But I'm afraid it takes years of learning. This is gonna be a real party, isn't it? A memorable occasion actually because  You're the first you and Freddie. Besides John here  there's nobody else knows. Look here, Oliver I really  Poor Freddie. It's a greater shock to you than anyone, isn't it? You too will get used to the change. Why, you won't even remember us as we were. Laura and I joke about it now. Why, it's difficult even for us to remember. Sob  What is it, mother? Oh my poor boy. My poor poor boy. Oh, mother. Just because you're happy. That's no reason to Forgive me, darling. I didn't mean to go to pieces like this. It's just that I love you so, Ollie. And if you're happy, then I guess that's all that really matters. I'm glad he married you, my dear. Believe me, I am. It's clear you're such a loyal girl. You've got so much to give him. So much more than just a pretty girl. And it's so fortunate. We're all so fortunate that Oliver has an income. And that Freddie and I are in a position to help. That way you'll be able to stay right on here the two of you. Of course, Freddie and I will visit you as often as we can. It won't be necessary for you to see people or  What would you like in your tea, Mrs. Price.? Oh, you mustn't bother about tea, Laura. Really you mustn't. I couldn't swallow a mouthful. I have a dreadful headache coming on. I know you'll forgive us if we just run along. You poor poor darling. - Come along. - Yes, Violet. I thought that I could spare you this. But I don't understand. You've known the truth about us, haven't you, John? You've known all along. Yes, I have. Oh! And you've known too. Because you know about the cottage. We'd like to talk to you, Mrs. Minnett. You've known my wife for a long time. Yes. And you've known me for quite a while. Yes. We want the truth, Mrs. Minnett. Have you had any time since our marriage noticed any change in our appearance? Have you? Have you seen any change whatever? No. Look at us. Look at us, Miss. Minnett. There was no change now? None. Why didn't you tell us? There's nothing I could've told you. When I knew you had to find out the truth this afternoon, I  I felt my heart would break. And yet What is there really to be sad about? Shall I tell you the secret? Shall I? Please. You love each other. You've fallen in love  And a man and woman in love have the gift of sight... that isn't granted to other people. I watched you. I've watched you from the beginning. And on the day of your wedding, I saw your love blaze up like dry kindling wood. Keep your love burning. Keep it burning. And I promise you, you'll never be anything to one another but fair and handsome! That's the charm. That's the secret to the only enchantment this cottage holds. It's of your own making. Just as I am. My man could rise from his grave. And walk-in this minute  And I should be pretty to him. Yes. Pretty to him. Don't feel badly, John. I wanted so to help. You did help. If we had known sooner, it might have. But now Well, that be Danny. He's come to fetch me. Goodbye, John. Goodbye, Laura. Until tomorrow Yes. Goodbye, John.. Goodbye, Oliver. You'll always be beautiful to me. And nothing could ever change the way I feel about you. You know that? Yes, dearest. I know. Oliver? We've never written our names. Somehow I think they'd want us to.
