A chip off the old block. And you gotta know who's gonna raise him. - His parents? - OK, sure, get technical. But who's gonna teach him the really important stuff? Like how to belch. And dig for grubs. I'm tellin' ya, buddy, it's gonna be like old times. You, me and the little guy. - It is a girl. - Girl. Girl? Wow! Whoa! Where do you think you're going in such a hurry? Daddy. Let go. Now, I just want you to be careful. Kiara, are you listening? Accidents can happen. - You could easily get hurt... - Hurt or stepped on or even get lost. And remember, I want you to stay in sight of Pride Rock at all times. I know. And if I see any strangers, don't talk to them, come straight home. OK, OK. Can I go now? Please? Hmm. Very funny. - Mind your father, Kiara. - Yes, Mom. And stay away from the Outlands. Nothing there but a bunch of back-stabbing, murderous Outsiders. Zazu's right. You can't turn your back on them. - Really? How come? - Never mind. - Just run along now. - But, Dad, I... - You'll understand some day. Go on. - Dad. And stay on the path I've marked for you. Simba. Who does she remind you of? Huh? What? Who? She's just like you were when you were young. Exactly. Do you realise the dangers we put ourselves in? You mean the dangers you put us in. She'll be fine. - Hey, Timon, Pumbaa. Come here. - Good morning, mon capitaine. I want you to keep a close watch on Kiara. You know she's bound to run off. Don't worry, Simba. We're on her like stink on a warthog. - Hey! - It's a hard truth, Pumbaa. Live with it. Guys, I'm counting on you. Danger could be lurking behind every rock. Aha! Hmm. Hey, wait. Come back. I just wanna play. The mighty hunter has cornered her prey. Whoa! Cool. The Outlands. I wonder what's out there. Don't worry, Kiara. Uncle Pumbaa's coming. Oh, no. Oh! Uh... Let's see. "Gee, Simba, the good news is we found your daughter." "The bad news is we dropped a warthog on her. Is there a problem with that?" - Kiara? Kiara! - Pumbaa! Let me define "baby-sitting". Sorry. Princess Kiara, as Simba's daughter, you know better than to go off all alone. - You could have been hurt. - But... Hurt? Oh, Simba would kill us. You didn't slip a disc, did ya? - But... - Catch a fever? Get a hangnail? - Timon. - I had one once. - Very painful. - Excruciating. Darling, with your complexion you should stay out of the sun. What? Do you wanna wrinkle? Will somebody please just listen to me? I'm sorry, I wasn't listening. Did you say something, Princess? I'm not just a princess, you know. That's only half of who I am. - Oh. Who's the other half? - Uh, well, I, um... Well, while you're figuring it out, let's eat! Grubs. - The other white meat. - And so high in protein. Ew! Gross! No? How about you, big boy? - Love grubs. - Not like. Love! You always do that! You take a bite out of every one and then put it back. It drives me crazy. But you can't tell from the outside which are the real slimy ones. Slimy? Pumbaa, my corpulent compadre, it's the crunchy ones that make the meal. - Slimy. - Crunchy. - Slimy. - Crunchy. - Slimy. - Crunchy. - Slimy. - Crunchy. - Slimy. - Crunchy. - Slimy. - Crunchy. - Less filling. - Tastes good. - Less filling. - Tastes good. - Less filling. - Tastes good. - Less filling. - Tastes good... Who are you, Pridelander? - What are you doing? - My father says to never turn your back on an Outsider. - You always do what Daddy says? - No! Bet you do. Bet you're Daddy's little girl. An Outsider doesn't need anybody. - I take care of myself. - Really? Cool. Run! Whoa! This way! - That was a close one. - Yeah. Not good! Whoa! - Hey, what about me? - I'll distract them. Run! Whoa! Look out! Move it! I did it. I did it! Ha! Oh, man. Did you see the size of those teeth? They were going... He was totally eatin' me up right there. And I jumped on his head and I bopped him so good... We make such a good team. And you... You were really brave. Yeah? You were pretty brave too. - My name's Kovu. - I'm Kiara. Tag. You're it. Tag. You're it, you're it! Hello? You run, I tag - get it? What's the matter? Don't you know how to play? - Zira. - Simba. - Nala. - Zira. Timon. Pumbaa. Great. Now that we all know each other... get out of our Pridelands! Your Pridelands? These lands belong to Scar. I banished you from the Pridelands. Now you and your young cub, get out. Oh. Haven't you met my son, Kovu? He was hand-chosen by Scar to follow in his paw prints and become king. That's not a king, that's a fuzzy maraca. Kovu was the last born before you exiled us to the Outlands - where we have little food, less water. You know the penalty for returning to the Pridelands. But the child does not. However, if you need your pound of flesh, here. Take him and get out. We're finished here. Oh, no, Simba. We have barely begun. Bye. Bye. Simba? Kiara, what did you think you were doing? You could've been killed today. - But Daddy, I didn't mean to diso... - I'm telling you this because I love you. - I don't wanna lose you. - I know. If something happened to you, I don't know what I'd do. One day I won't be here and I need you to carry on in my place. - You are part of the great Circle... - Circle of Life. I know. Exactly. And you need to be careful. As future queen... What if I don't wanna be queen? It's no fun. That's like saying you don't wanna be a lion. It's in your blood. - As I am. We are part of each other. - Hm. As you go through life you'll see There is so much that we Don't understand And the only thing we know Is things don't always go The way we planned But you'll see every day That we'll never turn away When it seems all your dreams come undone We will stand by your side Filled with hope and filled with pride We are more than we are We are one We are one We are one If there's so much I must be Can I still just be me The way I am? Can I trust in my own heart? Or am I just one part Of some big plan? Even those who are gone Are with us as we go on Yourjourney has only begun Tears of pain, tears ofjoy One thing nothing can destroy Is our pride, deep inside We are one We are one We are one We are one, you and I We are like the earth and sky One family under the sun All the wisdom to lead All the courage that you need You will find when you see We are one As long as you live here, it's who you are. You'll understand some day. Kovu, Kovu, Kovu. Scar wasn't even his father. He just took him in. Hey, Vitani. Where's the little termite Kovu? The Chosen One. Nuka, where's Kovu? Did you leave him out there on his own again? It's every lion for himself out here. That termite's gotta learn to be on his own. Mother's gonna be mad. She told you to watch him. Who cares? I should've been the chosen one. I'm the oldest, I'm the strongest, I'm the smartest... Oh, these termites! I could be a leader if she'd just give me a chance. Yeah, right. Why don't you tell that to her? Yeah? Don't think I won't. - Oh, yeah? Here's your chance. - What? Oh, Mother. Mother, hi. Mother, I caught some field mice for your dinner. I left them by the... OK. Hey, Kovu. Wanna fight? You were supposed to be watching him! It's not his fault. I went off on my own. - What were you doing? - Nothing. - Who has made us Outsiders? - Simba. - Who killed Scar? - Simba. What have I told you about them? I'm sorry, Mother. She didn't seem so bad. - I thought we could be... - Friends? You thought you'd get to the daughter and Simba would welcome you with open arms? What an idea! What an idea. You brilliant child. I'm so proud of you. You have the same conniving mind that made Scar so powerful. Bah! Chosen One... I now see the path to our glorious return to power. - But I don't want... - Hush! Hush, my little one. You must be exhausted. Sleep, my little Kovu Let your dreams take wing One day when you're big and strong You will be a king - Good night. - Good night, my little prince. Tomorrow your training intensifies. I've been exiled, persecuted, Left alone with no defence When I think of what that brute did, I get a little tense But I dream a dream so pretty That I don't feel so depressed Cos it soothes my inner kitty And it helps me get some rest The sound of Simba's dying gasp His daughter squealing in my grasp His lioness's mournful cry That's my lullaby Now the past I've tried forgetting And my foes I could forgive Trouble is I know it's petty But I hate to let them live So you found yourself somebody who'll chase Simba up a tree Oh, the battle may be bloody But that kind of works for me The melody of angry growls A counterpoint of painful howls A symphony of death, oh my... That's my lullaby Scar is gone, but Zira's still around To love this little lad Till he learns to be a killer With a lust for being bad Sleep, you little termite. I mean, precious little thing One day when you're big and strong You will be a king The pounding of the drums of war The thrill of Kovu's mighty roar - The joy of vengeance - Testify - I can hear the cheering - Kovu, what a guy Payback time is nearing And then our flag will fly Against a blood-red sky That's my lullaby Oh, Mufasa, every day Kiara grows more beautiful, into a queen that will some day make us all very proud. But this cub Kovu grows stronger and Zira fills his heart with hate. I'm very worried, Mufasa. Things are not going well, no. Mm? You have a plan? What? Kovu. Kiara. Together? This is the plan? Are you crazy? This will never work. Oh, Mufasa, you've been up there too long. Your head is in the clouds. OK, OK, OK, OK. All right, OK! I don't think this is going to work, but I trust you. I just hope you know what you are doing. You are ready. Nice. Very nice. You have the same blackness in your soul that Scar had. What is your destiny? I will avenge Scar. - Take his place in the Pridelands. - Yes. What have I taught you? Simba is the enemy. And what must you do? I must kill him. You must be so proud, Nala. This is Kiara's first hunt. There she is. Kiara. - You can do it. - It's your day. - Your first time. - My, how you've grown. You'll do just fine. Daddy? You have to promise to let me do this on my own. Promise? All right. I promise. Make sure she doesn't get hurt. This place is even creepier since the hyenas ran off. Oh, sheesh. I'm not scared, OK? I just don't know why we have to be here, that's all. If Kovu is so special, why does he need us? I never even had a chance... That's it. Come on. Kiara has started her hunt. We have to move quickly. Yah! Fire! Tango Charlie Alpha, what's your position? Uhh... upright. Head turned slightly to the left. Tail erect. Why do I bother? This must be where the deer and the antelope play. Timon, what are you doing here? Uh, shopping. We thought a nice pelt for the den, throw pillows, a little potpourri... My father sent you. After he promised to let me do this on my own. He lied! No. He just doesn't want you to get hurt. I should've known he'd never give me a real chance. I'll do this on my own - away from the Pridelands. - Hey, wait. Come back! - Come back here! Kiara! Kiara, come back! Oh, she's gone again! Somebody's gotta get a beeper for this kid. Let's light fires! Roasty toasty princess Roasty toasty princess Hey, is it hot in here or is that just me? Fire! Come on! The plan is in motion. Go! Don't worry, Simba, she'll be fine. What could happen? No. No! Kiara! Zazu, fly ahead. Find her. Huh? I must tell Simba! - Where am I? - You're safe in the Pridelands. The Pridelands? No. Why did you bring me here? Who do you think you are? I think I'm the one that just saved your life. - I had everything under control. - Not from where I'm standing. Then move downwind. What are you doing? Kovu? Kiara! Kiara, you're all right. Father, how could you break your promise? It's a good thing I did. I almost lost you. No more hunts for you, not ever. But I was doing just fine. Even before Kovu... Kovu? Simba! Hey, you! How dare you save the king's daughter? - You saved her? Why? - I humbly ask to join your pride. No. You were banished with the other Outsiders. I have left the Outsiders. I'm a rogue. Judge me now for who I am. Or am I to be blamed for a crime I didn't commit? Simba, you owe him your daughter's life. Yes, sire. Clearly we are in his debt, and royal protocol demands that all debts be paid. Though in this case you might want to make an exception. My father's law will prevail. For now I reserve judgment. We'll see who you really are. Hm! Riffraff. Thanks for saving me today. What kind of hunter are you anyway, Princess? - You almost got yourself killed out there. - What? - You wouldn't last three days on your own. - Oh. And I suppose you could teach me? Well, yeah. - Kiara! - Coming! All right. Impress me. We start at dawn. I'll look forward to it. Did you see that? He let her go! If that were me... Hush. The fire rescue worked perfectly and Simba fell for it. Now the closer Kovu gets to the daughter, the closer he gets to Simba. And once he has Simba alone... Simba! Simba! - Help me! - Father! No! Dad! Just a little farther... Gotcha! Trust me. Simba! No! Scar. Kovu? No! Good morning. I'm ready for my first lesson. I surprised you, huh? Hey, c'mon. Let's go. - Three, two, one... - Gotcha. You could hear me, huh? Only a lot. You're still breathing too hard. Relax. Feel the earth under your paws so it doesn't shift and make noise. Watch the master and learn. Don't eat me, please. I never really met your tyrant... I mean, Scar, Scar. Oh, heck of a guy. A little moody, but... Timon, what are you doing here? Kiara, thank goodness! Oh! Hey, for once we're not following you. This just happens to be the best smorgasbord in the Pridelands. Bugs everywhere. But you don't call for a reservation and... yeesh! Get outta here, you scavengers! Go on, shoo, shoo! Oh, Timon! I'm getting tired. I've gotta lose some pounds. Shoo! Go on, shoo, shoo! - Maybe he could help. Do you think? - Shoo! Oh, yeah, there's an idea. Right, let the vicious Outsider... Hey. Wait. - I have an idea. What if he helps? - What? You wanna lend a voice? Huh? Roar! Work with me! Like this. Whoo-hoo! Come on. Do it again, do it again! Yee-hah! Why are we doing this? What's the point of this training? Training? This is just for fun. Fun? Sheesh, kid, you gotta get out more often. Fun? Yee-hah! Whoo-hoo! Yee-hah! Yee-hah! Whoa, whoa, whoa! Yee-hah! Hey, rhino! - What a blast! - Uh... sorry. You're OK, kid. You're OK. Pardon me. That's it, that's it, that's it! Hey. Are you two coming or what? - Do you see that? - What? - Oh, wow. Look at that. It's really pretty. - Yeah. You're right. Oh, look. There's one that looks like a baby rabbit. See the fluffy tail? Yeah. There's one that looks like two lions killing each other for a scrap of meat. - I've never done this before. - Really? My father and I used to do this all the time. He says all the great kings of the past are up there. Do you think Scar's up there? He wasn't my father, but he was still part of me. My father has said there was a darkness in Scar that he couldn't escape. Maybe there's a darkness in me too. Father, I am lost. Kovu is one of them. Scar's heir. - How can I accept him? - Simba? I was seeking counsel from the great kings. - Did they help? - Silent as stars. - My father would never... - Oh, my Simba. You want so much to walk the path expected of you. - Perhaps Kovu does not. - What? How do you know? I can see them down there just as easily as you can. Get to know him and see. - What's wrong? - Nothing. Kovu... It's just that my whole life I've been trained to... - Nothing. I gotta go. - Kovu, wait. - And where are you going? - Nuh... nowhere. Ha! That's what you think. - Who was that? - A friend of the family. Come on. You follow old Rafiki, he knows the way. - Way to where? - You follow, you see. Hurry now. Kovu, come on. - Where's he taking us? - To a special place in your heart, called Upendi. There's a place where the crazy moon Makes the monkeys sing and the baboons swoon And the sultry scent of the lotus bloom Will carry you away Where the hippos swing from the jungle vines And the rhino rumba in a conga line All the pink flamingos are intertwined As the stars come out to play In Upendi Where the passion fruit grows sweet And it's so divine that you lose your mind As it sweeps you off your feet In Upendi Without a worry or a care It just takes two to make it true Your heart will lead you there Where is it? No place you don't take with you. You better watch your step cos the path is steep Better hold your breath cos the water's deep It's a long way down over lover's leap But falling's half the fun In Upendi Where the passion fruit grows sweet And it's so divine that you lose your mind As it sweeps you off your feet In Upendi Without a worry or a care It just takes two to make it true Your heart will take you there You can beat the bush like there's no tomorrow From Tanganyika to Kilimanjaro But you'll find Upendi wherever you are Underneath the sun Upendi means love, doesn't it? Welcome to Upendi! In Upendi Where the passion fruit grows sweet And it's so divine that you lose your mind As it sweeps you off your feet In Upendi Without a worry or a care It just takes two to make it true Your heart Will take you there Upendi Down in Upendi Way down in Upendi Down in Upendi Way down in Upendi In Upendi... In Upendi... - Good night. - Good night. It's kind of cold tonight. Come on in. Get him. What are you waiting for, Kovu? Get him. - You're sure? - Affirmative. I saw it with my own eyes. No. Kovu cannot betray us. OK. I have to tell her today. Where do I start? Kiara, Zira had a plot. I was part of it, but I don't wanna be because... Because I love you. She'll never believe me. But I gotta try. Kiara, I need to talk to you. Kiara, I don't want you talking with him. I want to talk with him. Scar couldn't let go of his hate, and in the end it destroyed him. I've never heard the story of Scar that way. He truly was a killer. Fire is a killer. Sometimes what's left behind can grow better than the generation before. If given the chance. Oh, no. No! - Why, Simba. - Zira! What are you doing out here and so alone? Well done, Kovu. - Just like we always planned. - You! - No, I didn't have anything to do with this! - Attack! No! Yes! We've got him. Remember your training. As a unit. - Simba! - Get him, Kovu. Get him! Do it. Now! I'll do it for you, Mother! Mother, are you watching? I'm doing it for you and I'm doing it for me. This is my moment of glory. No! Nuka. I'm sorry, Mother. I tried. Father? Father! - Zazu, get help. - Oh, yes, help. At once. Of course. Father. Simba, talk to me. What happened? Kovu. Ambush. No. It's all right, buddy. We're here for you. Scar, watch over my poor Nuka. You! What have you done? I didn't mean to. It wasn't my fault. I... I did nothing. Exactly. And in doing so you betrayed your pride. - Betrayed Scar. - I want nothing more to do with him. You cannot escape it. Nuka is dead because of you. - No. - You killed your own brother. No! Let him go. Simba has hurt me for the last time. Now he has corrupted Kovu. Listen to me. Simba is injured and weak. Now is the time to attack. We will take his entire kingdom by force! - Daddy, it can't be true. - It's Kovu. It's Kovu. Kovu! Why, I oughta... Let me at him, let me at him! Here, hold me back. - OK. - Let me at him, let me at him! OK. I think you're missing the basic point here. - What's he doing? - Look at that scar on his face. - Why have you come back? - Simba, I had nothing to do with... - You don't belong here. - Please. I ask your forgiveness. Daddy, please, listen to him. Silence! When you first came here you asked for judgment, and I pass it now. - Exile! - No! No! Kovu! Deception Disgrace Evil as plain as the scar on his face - Deception - An outrage - Disgrace - For shame He asked for trouble the moment he came - Deception - An outrage - Disgrace - For shame - Evil as plain as the scar on his face - See you later, agitator - Just leave us alone - An outrage - Disgrace - Traitor, go back with your own He asked for trouble the moment he came See you later, agitator Born in grief Raised in hate Helpless to defy his fate Let him run Let him live But do not forget what we cannot forgive And he is not one of us He has never been one of us He is not part of us Not our kind Someone once lied to us Now we're not so blind For we knew he would do what he's done And we know that he'll never be one of us He is not one of us Deception Disgrace Deception Disgrace Deception Father, please reconsider. You will not go anywhere without an escort from now on. - No, that's not... - He used you to get to me. No. He loves me. For me. Because you are my daughter. You will not leave Pride Rock. You will stay where I can keep an eye on you. Away from him. - You don't know him. - I know he's following in Scar's paw prints. - And I must follow in my father's. - You will never be Mufasa! Kovu? Kovu? Kovu? In a perfect world One we've never known We would never need To face the world alone They can have the world We'll create our own I may not be brave or strong or smart But somewhere in my secret heart I know Love will find a way Anywhere I go I'm home If you are there beside me Like dark turning into day Somehow we'll come through Now that I've found you Love will find a way I was so afraid Now I realise Love is never wrong And so it never dies There's a perfect world Shining in your eyes And if only they could feel it too The happiness I feel with you They'd know Love will find a way Anywhere we go We're home If we are there together Like dark turning into day Somehow we'll come through Now that I've found you Love will find a way I know Love will find a way Hey, look. We are one. - What? - Let's get outta here. We'll run away together and start a pride all our own. - Kovu, we have to go back. - You're kidding? But we're finally together. Our place is with our pride. If we run away, they'll be divided forever. I can't believe we lost her again. This is the eight thousandth time. - I thought you were gonna watch her. - Me? You were gonna watch her. - I thought you were gonna watch her. - No, you were gonna watch her. Watch this! Take that, you creepy warthog! - Say it! Say it! - Fat! Fatty! Fat! Fat! What are you doing? Good question. Let me ask you one. - Hypothetically. - Very hypothetical. There's this guy... - But he's not a lion. - No, no. He's not a lion. Sheesh. Definitely not a lion. - And, uh, his daughter, say, vanished. - Kiara's gone? Sire, the Outsiders are on the attack, heading this way. It's war! Zazu, find Kiara. We'll assemble the lionesses. Move now. It's over, Simba. I have dreamed of nothing else for years. - Boy, does she need a hobby. - Last chance, Zira. Go home. I am home. Attack! Go for the eyes! Break his jaw! Hit him low! Get them! Do what you must! - What do we do? What do we do? - There's only one thing we can do. When the going gets tough, the tough get going. That's our motto. I thought our motto was hakuna matata. Stop living in the past. We need a new motto. Yee-hah! Like I said, let's get going! - Where's your pretty daughter, Nala? - Vitani. Don't anybody move. This thing's loaded. I'll let you have it. Yeah! Talk about your winds of war. Simba! You're mine. Kiara? Kovu! - Move. - Stand aside. Daddy, this has to stop. You're even weaker than I thought. Get out of the way. You'll never hurt Kiara or Simba. Not while I'm here. Stay out of this. A wise king once told me "We are one." I didn't understand him then. Now I do. - But they... - Them? Us? Look at them. They are us. What differences do you see? - Vitani, now. - No, Mother. Kiara's right. Enough. If you will not fight, then you will die as well. Where are you going? Get back here! Let it go, Zira. It's time to put the past behind us. I'll never let it go. This is for you, Scar. Kiara! Kiara! Kiara! Hold on, Kiara! Simba! Simba, the river! Zira, give me your paw. Zira, come on. I'll help you. Kiara. Daddy. I tried. Kiara! Wow! That was really brave. Yee-hah! - Kovu. - Oh, Kiara. Kovu? I was wrong. You belong here. Let's go home. All of us. - I love moments like this! - Yeah. Love, not like. Love! Well done, my son. We are one. In a perfect world One we've never known We would never need To face the world alone They can have their world We'll create our own I may not be brave or strong or smart But somewhere in my secret heart I know Love will find a way Anywhere I go I'm home If you are there beside me Like dark turning into day Somehow we'll come through Now that I've found you Love will find a way I was so afraid Now I realise Love is never wrong And so it never dies There's a perfect world Shining in your eyes And if only they could feel it too The happiness I feel with you They'd know Love will find a way Anywhere we go We're home If we are there together Like dark turning into day Somehow we'll come through Now that I've found you Love will find a way I know Love will find a way Anywhere we go I'm home If we are there together Like dark turning into day Somehow we'll come through Now that I've found you Love will find a way I know love will find a way I know Love will find A way
