He wants to find lost memories. Because nothing ever changes in 2046. Nobody knows if it's true or not. Because nobody did not return. Except me. If someone wanted to leave in 2046, it would take him how long? Some succeed fairly quickly. Others find that their takes more time. I forgot how long I spent on this train. I'm starting to feel very lonely. As I said, many left for 2046. You are the first to return. Why did you leave in 2046? Whenever someone asks why I left in 2046, I have the same answer imprecise. Formerly, when people had secrets, they did not want to share, they climbed a mountain. They were a tree, there carved a hole, and to murmuring their secrets. They then covered it with mud. That way no one else discovered do not. I fell in love with someone. After a time, she was gone. I left for 2046. I thought that I would expect. But I have not found. I keep asking myself if she loved me or not. But I never knew. Maybe the answer is as a secret that no one will ever know. All the memories are the traces of tears. You did not promise not to return? I came to see you. Why? I have no future here. I'll see how it happens in Hong Kong. When are you leaving? Boat leaves in two days. Why tell me? I thought we could leave together. You know nothing of my past, does not it? If you prefer not tell me anything, I do not mind. If you win, I go with you. She had found a way diverted to push me away. In retrospect, it's been the last time we saw each other. Immediately after, I left Singapore. I was back to Hong Kong in late 1966. Because of the increase the price of ferry tickets, there were riots in Kowloon. I did not know how long I would stay. I took a room in a small hotel in Wanchai. I wrote articles for newspapers. They paid the HK $ 10 thousand words. It was pretty hard at first. As long as I could reach both ends, what I wrote had not matter. "Journal of Heroes Bazooka". "The new star Luk Kwok Club is called Fei Fei! " "A real gun with beautiful bazookas! " "A big success lovers breasts! " Wait, I'm exaggerating of course. I can not say that her breasts are fake, though? I quickly got used to this lifestyle. I became a true womanizer. With great adventures of a night. But nothing lasts forever. December 24, 1966 Really? Why am I lying? You know me really? You were not in a show in Singapore in 64? Si You are Lulu. I was. Not anymore. What is your name now? I would tell you why? Christmas Eve 1966, I met a friend of Singapore in a box. It was rather close. But that night, she had apparently forgotten. Was there really ever seen? How could you forget? You said I looked like your late boyfriend. You taught me the cha-cha-cha. Continues. You still dragged myself to the casino. You knew a period bad luck. You possessed a fortune. My friends and I paid for your passage to Hong Kong. You spoke a lot your deceased boyfriend. A Chinese Filipino from from a rich family. You had planned to marry. But he died young. You said it was the love of your life. I should not remember sad memories at this time of year. But you remember Tonight's Christmas we went to drink? Much has been made. Did she pretend to have forgotten me? I just drove to his hotel, she slept. She drank too much, so I quickly left. Upon leaving, I noticed a very familiar number. If I had not seen that night, I would not have seen this issue. And I would not have written "2046". Can I help you? Miss Lulu's there? Lulu? There is no Miss Lulu here. There was a Mimi but she left. But there I was there two days! You know where she went? No! What do you want him? Nothing special. I have his key. I wanted it to him. You can give it to me. Thank you. You want to rent the room? I just returned from abroad. I have not yet home. If the room is free, I can take a look. This is only a small hotel. But our tenants are all suitable. What is your job? I write for newspapers. Great! An artist! I have not always done that. I was also an artist. Really? I took courses Singing in Harbin. At that time, I was tenor. It would be a pleasure have you with us. When do you move? As soon as possible. But, the 2046 should be redecorated. The 2047 is free. You can visit it. Do not bother. I'll come back when it's ready. But why this room, in particular? This is perhaps the number. C'? meaningful to you? Just kidding. Listen, see the 2047. If it suits you, you might install. You will change for 2046 when it is ready. What say you? I can see the room? Of course! Please ... Once installed, I discovered what had happened the night before. Lulu had been stabbed by a jealous boyfriend. A drummer working the box. She liked him. She compared him to a bird can not arise. During all these years, she had sought his bird without legs. Most his loves ended badly. But that does not bother her. No matter what happened, at least, she remained the leader. Well! Of course! Go! Let's go! Let's go! I'll go with you! Fine. I'll go with you! Of course! I understand! You see? I know ... I understand. I understood! Can I go? I can go! Of course! I understand! I understood! The renovation of the 2046 was not long. But I got used to the 2047. Of course! I started to hear a funny voice through the wall. I thought someone had moved. But it was the owner's daughter the hotel, Mr. Wang. Categorically! I go, categorically! OK, let's go! I had no idea what she said. The courier told me it was the Japanese. It seemed she had a Japanese boyfriend. Tell the driver: "220 Granville Road." - Ga. .. ran ... wai ... - 220 Granville Road. Turn to Humphreys Avenue, near Kimberley Road. Can you repeat? - Do not turn in Salisbury Road. - Slowly. I'll make a plan. This is my pen! I repeat again. Turns from of Humphreys Avenue, near Kimberley Road. But does not turn Salisbury Road. Got it? I'll make a plan. Granville Road. Turns from of Humphreys Avenue. But does not turn Salisbury Road. Remember not to turn Salisbury Road. His company had sent the Japanese in Hong Kong. Upon his arrival, he was staying at this hotel. The world is full of men! Why'd you have chosen a Japanese? Get rid of him! I never meet him! You want my blessing? Not while I live! It lasted for years. Mr. Wang's family had suffered Japanese during the war. They had to break. Can you tell me what you feel? You love me? Or not? I'm afraid to hear your response. But I have to ask anyway. Go with me. Goodbye. He finally returned to Japan. It was at that time that Miss Wang began talking to herself. Ask your boss down a bit! Mr. Chow, you should it ask yourself. Mr Chow ... It is not gone yet? Why he came back? I do not want to see it! If you do not quit ... Get out! Go with him! I assumed that Mr. Wang rising sound because of his love for the opera. In fact, he did not want hear the family feud. What are you doing? Come back when you get few more years! I said: expect to grow a little! I like it. Wang thought very little his two daughters. The eldest of his Japanese was crazy. The youngest was early for his age. She came into my room, to drink. Then she ran off with a man. Another drummer of a group, so it seems. After his departure, his older sister was also in trouble. Talk to your boss for me. I'm a little late for rent. In any case, he has my deposit. Mr. Chow, tell him yourself. It is dirty humor, these days. What is his problem? First, a girl who runs away. Then the other to the hospital. That's why he is so angry. Why is she in hospital? He did not say, It was rather odd. Who knows what he thinks! So that's it? In any case, please give him my invitation. This is a banquet for my father's birthday. It may deduct its gift the rent I owe. Then they introduced the curfew in Hong Kong. Homemade bombs had spread panic. The economy stagnated. I stopped going out. Some thought I had changed. In fact, I wrote. A story titled "2046". About men and women looking for love, risking everything to reach at a place called 2046. What is it? Going to ... In 2046. I did it as bizarre and erotic as possible. Without stand this qu'aimaient readers. Things were not going the point of view science fiction, but all "2046" meant to me was the number of a hotel room. I invented everything. But some of my own experiences were there. The people I met in life evolved in my story. I felt better and better in my fictional world. At this time, the music of Mr. Wang again became stronger. Other problems with his two daughters. But also because of the economic crisis. Many rooms were empty. In September, the riots came to an end. Life returned to normal. Soon, someone moved in 2046. You almost finished? It is too early for that! Y'en trying to sleep! You spy? The Woman Next Door is a real gun! What are my chances? You've lost your mind! An expectant father should to think about it! Now she is pregnant, my wife leaves me more touching! Go. Tell him from me. OK. How? How much you got? Only $ 100 ... Waiting for my call. Mr. Chow! Mr. Chow, a call for you! Rested, right? It is not up yet. Why? I told it had to be arranged. This is not a whore! An artist like you. A little respect, you want? Yes. I will tell you immediately! Miss Bai, your key. You're back, Miss Bai. Who is it? Who are you looking? Mr Chow suggested I go ... You're back, Mr. Chow. You won the races? I lost! I won a little. You seek me? I think you know this person? What are you doing in that room? You said you would fix that! I've paid! When I said it was this room? - I said this room. - I said it. Your daughter is in that room. As this is embarrassing! Excuse him, please. I said: left the room! - I said I wanted one! - Shut up! Who is it? You again! I want to apologize for the other night. Forget it. Go. Ping, my editor, has been inappropriate behavior. But it is not like that. Just a bit stingy! He never pays his tour! He always says he is broke when the bill arrives. So I thought it a prank. At my expense? You did not go too far? He walked only because of your beauty. You're a real charmer! I do assert what is true! A modest sign of apology, accept it, please. I do not want it. You are still angry, does not it? - Take it, please. - No! - Go. - No! It's just a sign ... Do not laugh, I meant what I said! Get out! That's good. To come out. What should I do to make it go better? Hit me again! You think I would not dare? Step right up! Bastard! Do not be so insensitive! Enough. I'm kind of not you strike again. That does not mean that you can enjoy! This time I let go. If ever there was a next time, I'll be less polite. It will not happen again. My face is still numb. Accept it! No! This is only a mark of respect. I chose them myself. See if you like. Otherwise, discard them. Fine. I'm going. Calm down! That concern you with that I went out last night! Who? Dabao! What Dabao? The bulk or thin? Shanghai or Shandong? The problem is that I know so Dabao. How do I know which you speak? Yes, indeed. What can you do? Perfect! I will wait! Let me tell you ... Get out! You think I can accept that? Her or me, you'd better choose! Get out! December 24, 1967 You come back soon! It's Christmas! You should not eat with your boyfriend? What boyfriend? Go to supper, then! Go. You have so many friends! You need company? Go out with them! They all want to be with me, but I can choose. To be fair, I see none. Come. Do not stay not locked. I'm not in the mood tonight. I might be drunk, and hit you again. It is nothing, I'm used to! If I can hit make you happy, accept this as Christmas gift! Come. Follow me. Let me go! I did not expect to spend Christmas like this. You expected what? We had made plans. He took me to Singapore. He says he's hot there, at Christmas. So I did not even away winter clothes. What I'm wearing now ... is for the summer! You were in Singapore? I worked there for several years. What kind of work? For a newspaper. It's fun out there? Okay. Tell me more. I will not, so I have to imagine. What do you know? How's the weather? Rather hot. All year. Sometimes we can not say what season it is. The restaurants are great! Ping and I often ate after work. We ate and drank until dawn. Our landlord was a funny guy. Short and stout, still wearing a skirt, that the Malays call a "sarong". But when you're away from home, one can begin to get bored. Heavy, this meal! We'll have a drink somewhere else? You drink? It makes things easier. When I drank, I have no worries. Your friends will abound, tonight? They are not glued to me! They see other men as well. We're just having fun. They still have their lives to do! I do not understand. Where will you lead all this fun? If you find the right person, why waste time with others? If I find the right person! A man like me has nothing else that free time. That's why I seek the company. People are only hobby for you? I would not say that. Other people may take me as a hobby. And tonight? I am your hobby, or are you mine? There is no difference! Maybe you've been earlier in the evening, and I am now. This is ridiculous! Make no mistake. I did not intend take advantage of you. If this is what I wanted, I would have other options. I just want us to be Friends of drinking. That's good, right? It's tough. But I'd like to try. OK. Try. - It goes where? - Let's go! Mr. Chow, you look happy, tonight! Certainly, my friends invite me to dinner. For here, please. Ping! It is the birthday someone? Better than that, Chow has a new girlfriend! You really have to party! Mr. Chow, what do you want eat tonight? Something expensive! The snake? Yes, the snake, it would be nice. It is not given. You can you afford? You're sure to win the bet? Shut up. Do not attention to him. - Your choice, Mr. Chow? - From snake! And lamb as well. And bring the whiskey to Hoi. Yes, very well. I could not leave it, it's delicious. Where is the girl, Chow? It is 2am. She will come? She will not come. I do not think she will. It's all your fault. This is because of you, if it went well. Why blame me, me? You are the only cause. You said she was kind and obedient. We know the truth! I said she was sometimes obedient, and sometimes nice. But it is very surprising, it's part of the charm. - And now? - Yeah, so? Anything you want. And then What happened there? Tell me! How are you thanking me? Pervert! Open! Who is it? Open the door! It's late. You've been good tonight. I finish work quite late. Too late to come. So I'm not coming. What is this? It's also your fault! How I would have known that do not you come? I thought winning a little money, instead of that, I lost my mustache. It's all your fault. You've earned it. Who inspired you to bet? I'll tell you. Ping asked me not to come. In any case, I did not like it too, that mustache. You're younger now. You do not like? Are you kidding me! You got me fooled! I'll get you. How you gonna get out? Give me a kiss, at least. You bit me! Come get me! Wait till I catch you! Do not touch me there! What? What are you doing? - I attack the other half. - No, not shave! Who knows where it was razor? It could bring me misfortune. It left for the second round! Why are you dressed? I return to my room. I'm exhausted. That's all I have. Currency except for the bus. Here is $ 200. Take them, I pray. I do not want it. I do not sell. This is not what I meant. I pay for your dress torn. Take it. I see. Are you afraid that I cling to you, right? Fine. I'll take $ 10. Say it is a discount. If you ever wanna come back, the price will be the same. I return to my room. Come here. Not tonight. Why not? You're not in the mood? I am tired tonight. Anyway, I am a little short on cash. That's okay, I can get you credit. No ... I do not have any debts. The reception is at 6 o'clock, dinner at 8. It's okay if you can not come, Simply send your gift. No more than you! You organize meals throughout the year! You have sent me invitations for 4 birthdays this year! I will send more invitations, later. Think of people who have money. Write their names and sends them invitations! OK, it's arranged. Mr. Chow, another party in preparation? We have several birthdays according to different calendars. One of mine is soon. Without a doubt. Here is an invitation for your boss. Tell him soon as it is, he may deduct his gift the rent I owe. Make sure he gets it. OK. It's late. What has he so urgent? I just got back from Macau. Chow asked me to bring you this gift. You were in Macao, both? Yes, we had few days off. We went to the casino. It's beautiful. He said he found the money, in his pocket. So, before you lose everything in the game, you bought the gift. Where is he? It is not yet returned. You know how it is. Prodigal earlier this month, and broke well before the end. He had several thousands guests at her party. While there, he plays really well. He is alone there? Of course not! There was a whole gang. He loves company. It has always been like that? Not talking about him. Drink a glass. But I should warn you. I know you like it a lot. Do not waste your time with him. It is not serious! Guess who? There is a possibility! Let me eat something before! What are you doing here? What am I doing here? What do you think? I think I was pretty wild. But you're worse! Bring the money! I did not see for ages. I was busy. Liar. Tell me the truth. This is what I do! Who was this woman, the other day? What woman? Not pretend. I saw her leave your room. Who is it? A friend. A friend? She did what in your room? Do not be curious, right? Return to your room. I have work. No! I sleep here tonight. For the night, it's very expensive. No problem. Your ad prices. I would give anything to be with you every day. Retail, okay. But the wholesale, out of the question. Why? I do not like it, that's all. You could do an exception for me? No. You treat all women like that? Except one. Who? My mother. I'm serious. I do not care that you have other women, but I will not be treated like them. I do not care if you love me or not. I love you anyway. Since we're together, I did not bring the other man. I hoped you would the same thing. You promise? No. I see ... So, you're done. I do not bother you. And I never want see you in my room. Here, $ 10. Tonight I will pay. Thank you! If ever you wanna go back, the price will be the same. Well you have fun? It looks at you? You were rather noisy, last night. This was intentional. You bring women why I would bring no men? I want to see if you do not care really. I will not, why do not you come here? Forget it, do not come. After Bai Ling had moved, she began out with Dabao. And I saw other women too. If by chance we crossed, we pretended not to see. Rather pathetic, I know. But it was better for us this to end well. She appeared in my stories. Your currency, check it, please. Thank you. You come out later? Why? You could post this letter for me? Of course. Then, Ms. Wang returned. I recognized the familiar on the other side of the wall. Take me with you, I beg you! Well! What are you doing? I have not been clear enough? Do not speak Japanese at this! Why do you write to her in secret? Are not you ashamed? Returns his letter! Not? What are you reading? A martial-arts novel. You love them? If your friend wants you send other letters, without your father knew it, tell him to contact the to my room. I will pass you. She seemed happier on his return, this time. They spoke more often. Mr. Chow, another letter for you. One more! These are Japanese so passionate! We meet again. Then, if you always think we should not be together, tell me frankly. There is 6 years old, that day, a rainbow appeared in my heart. He is always there, like a fire inside. But what are your feelings towards me? Are they like a rainbow sky after the rain? Or ... the rainbow has he disappeared long? I await your response. Why do you write all this stuff about sex? Not to starve! You are not worried not your reputation? Maybe I'm not that good. Why not try writing something else? Who would read it? And novels of martial arts? People like it. It's too hard. It was locked for months. It garnered only migraines. It was the right time ... I also like writing. It's hard to make a trade. I only do it for fun. I'll show you what I wrote. You're welcome. Here, read that first. You are prolific! You tell me what you think. And do not forget to return them to me! Of course! You have read my story? Yes. What do you think? I think you should write a word more. Why? You are so talented. You could make me lose my place. "The Master Spider launches his right fist. " "Two sticks start like rockets. " "They come with tremendous force!" "Badaboum! The mountain broke in two! " Gently I can not follow. Come on, they wait. Okay, okay. Got it? Continue. Where was I? "The mountain broke in two." Right ... "The mountain broke in two, "And collapses on the Iron Shield!" Iron Shield? He is not dead? Oh yeah? Let Iron Head, then. Where does this "Iron Head" suddenly? It'll pass in a martial-arts novel. You do not want to rest? I'll finish for you. OK. It was like having an assistant. I do not go out. I asked to make use of negro. It was a girl, but, she could also write commonly that the best of us. We got along very well. It was the happiest summer of my life. But it did not last. I encouraged him to confront his father. But she dared not. She wanted to be independent. I got him a job, at the door of a box. Thank you! She told her father she was dating me. Sometimes, I found an excuse to look after work. You come very late. You are ready to go? I have a taxi waiting. I can take you home. No, thank you. In this case, I do not expect. Feelings can creep in us inadvertently. I knew it, but it? She always asked if there was something never changed. I imagined what she thought. I promised to write a story based on my observations. To show this that her boyfriend thought. To laugh, we had thought to call it "2047". But maybe I was too indirect. I began to tell me that This was not the Japanese, but instead of me. I imagined in mysterious young Japanese, on board a train bound for 2046, falling in love with an android to delayed reactions. If someone wanted to leave in 2046, it would take him how long? Nobody can say. Some succeed fairly quickly. Others find that it takes them more time. It requires great strength. And that can hurt terribly. I forgot how long I spent on this train. I'm starting to feel very lonely. This is rather annoying at first. But, slowly, you get used to. We have a team of hostesses. They can meet all your desires. They will serve you faithfully. As a close friend. But you must never fall in love. Who fell in love with an android? Who knows? Things can creep in you, without you take notice. It happens all the time. Paragraph 201 of the guide Passenger stipulated that the area 1224-1225 is particularly cold. The heating of the train will not be enough. It is recommended that passengers hugging to keep warm. Being the only passenger, I embrace the hostess android my cabin. I wonder if it is his mechanism or my imagination, but I feel the heat on his artificial body. Why do you leave in 2046? You know what people did in the past, when they had secrets they did not want to share? They were climbing a mountain, were a tree, there carved a hole, and to murmuring their secrets. They then covered it with mud. In this way, else discovered do not. I'll be your tree! Tell me, and nobody one else will ever know. I always ... I always ... I always ... Very funny! I always ... I always ... Whenever someone asks why I left in 2046, I always ... I have the same answer imprecise. I always ... I fell in love with someone. I kept asking myself if she loved me or not. I found an android who was his perfect double. I thought the android give me the answer. 10 hours later I have a secret to tell. Go with me. I have a secret to tell. Go with me. I asked all the time, but she never replied. I invented reasons his silence. Do you know the Buddhist canon? "The 5 Damage Celestial Beings "? The 5 Damage Celestial Beings. This is about Gods and how they spend by this process. Our hostesses are beautifully designed. But there is a problem. After serving for so long trips, fatigue starts at be felt. They may have want to laugh, but the smile will time to come. They may have like crying, but the tears will not flow until the next day! It fails quickly. You should drop it. I was desperate. I almost quit. But I tried it again soon. I have a secret to tell. You go with me? I have a secret to tell. You go with me? You know what were people formerly when they had secrets? They were climbing a mountain, were a tree, There were digging a hole ... 990, 991, 992, 993, 994, 995 ... I began to doubt myself. His lack of response was not solely due its delayed reactions. Clearly she did not love me. I finally understand. It's beyond my control. All I had to do was giving up. December 24, 1968 Why invite me Christmas Eve? You know how I will lose in tips when not working? It would be awful to be alone tonight? I need company. That is me? Your boyfriend did not write for a while. I asked him. In any case, it's hopeless. He has no reason wait for me. Why not hope? Go get it! If you do not, then it will be hopeless. My father will never consent. If you were in his place, what would you do tonight? Why not ask him? You have his phone? I can not hear you. You can talk louder? I cry already! I felt like Santa Claus, that night. I took her to the newspaper, and have left to make a call long-distance boyfriend. I was happy to see her so happy. In fact, the region 1224-1225, it was the day and Christmas Day. On Christmas Eve, many people need more heat than usual. I did not understand. This was perhaps the best. 10 hours later I realized that if the android had not answered the question, it had nothing to do with wear of its mechanism, or she did not like him. More likely, she already loved another. Shortly after, she went to Japan. I gave him a copy of "2047". I hope she has read it. 100 hours later 1000 hours later Love is always a history synchronization. It is not good meeting the right person too early or too late. If I lived elsewhere and in another era, my story would have been an end totally different. I have to ask ... Yes? I will be away for a few days. Pay the rent this month to my daughter, please. She came back? No Jing Wen. I spoke my youngest daughter, Wen Jie. Your troubles are over, then! Going on vacation? No, I have to go to Japan. But you hate the Japanese! Why go to Japan? Jing Wen is getting married. Congratulations. I did not know if I should go or not. Now I am determined. I want her to be happy. When are you leaving? You can help me choose a gift? It's not worth it. She wanted me to asks for something. What? She read "2047". She likes it a lot. But it is the end too sad. She wonders if you could change? I'll see what I can do. An hour later 10 hours later 100 hours later Taxi! I would also like history happy ending, but I did not know how to write it. A few years earlier, I wanted a happy ending but I let it escape. I do not turn your back! He came here? What is it for you? While I touched the bottom, I fell again on Lulu. She had not changed, always terribly jealous. Do you think he's yours? I thought you knew him well! It's like that! We were just having fun. So calm my old! The watch has taught me something. If the answer is "no", there remains a chance get what you want. 18 months later Hello, Mr. Chow is there? I know I did no right to ask, but I was told that I will need a guarantor. The man who recruits girls in the nightclub says he knows you. You could say a word for me? No problem. I see who you mean. I see him in a day or two. Why did you choose Singapore? I did not want to stay here. It's been a while since I remember. I want to see what c'? air. Do not drink too much. You do not look good. Do not worry, it will not kill me. You know what? I came over here at Christmas. I thought to meet you. Why not me called first? I do not know. I came like that. I do not know why. That night, you got me terribly failed suddenly. We're friends of drinking. Of course I miss you. You're right. "We're friends of drinking". Let's go. Boy! Addition. Where you live? At the hotel, a fairly small room. But it's not too bad. I'll take you home. No, thank you. I just moved, this is a mess. I invite you when it's clean. I'll go first. Seeing how Bai Ling had changed, I was suddenly invaded by feelings of sadness. Indeed, the previous Christmas, I was not in Hong Kong. December 24, 1969 You have seen Miss Su? Miss Su ... not for a while. You know where I could find it? It is probably distributed to Phnom Penh. I did not want to spend Christmas 1969 in Hong Kong. So I visited Singapore and went back to the casino. I waited several days, but Black Spider never came back. Nobody knew where to find it. Some thought it was distributed to Phnom Penh. Others thought she was dead. Ping and I started to work in Singapore in 1963. When my life lost its meaning, I started playing daily. It was an ugly period. Only one person came to my rescue. A professional player. Some said she cheated people. She was always in black. It was called the Black Spider. She kept her black glove throughout the year. No one knew exactly why. His hand had been cut for cheating? The glove covered it a prosthesis? Nobody really knew. Why do you wear that black glove? Habit. You are not from here? I come from Phnom Penh. What a coincidence! I come from Cambodia. It's chaos out there, what were you doing? The newspaper had sent me there. Are you a journalist? Not anymore. Why? They made changes, I am a "consultant" now. Part time. The rest of the time I do nothing. Why do you spend your time at the casino, then? I tried to earn enough pay for my return to Hong Kong. You have lost a lot? Few thousand. You should never enter in a bad mood in a casino. You will not win. I did not expect to win, only retrieve my bet. If you rest, I can help you. On one condition. When you have recover your money, you will stop playing. Why would you help me? I take a commission. 10% of what I earn for you. Think about it. That could well bring him these miserable commission on my winnings? After that, we went back the casino every night. We ate at the restaurant, near the station. She won all I had lost. Thank you. Do not thank me, it's yours. If you need me tomorrow I'll wait here after dinner. I still do not know your name. It's Su ... Su Li Zhen. A few years earlier, I had fallen love with the wife of another. Her name was also Su Li Zhen. It is because of her that I went to Singapore. I never imagined meet another Su Li Zhen. I talked at length about the other. At first we kept the secret. But the rumors have spread. Then we went in a hotel. We had room 2046. In retrospect, everything looked like a dream. You loved him very much? That is history. Change the subject. You, what have you done before? Want to know my story? Play in the battle. If you win, I'll tell you everything. It faced its past me was like the hand she kept gloved. A mystery unanswered. Of all men I know, you're the best. I miss you already. Why do you come not with me? You did not ... promised not to ask? Hug me. We do meet again, perhaps not for several years. The night we saw each other for the last time, I said: Take care of yourself. Maybe one day you will escape your past. If you arrived there, looking for me. Now it seems that I told him I concerned, me, actually. In love, no substitutes. I was looking for what I had felt with the other Su Li Zhen. I had not realized, but I'm sure she had done. All this for me? Wanna get drunk? I know that thou endure it well. Drink! As much as we can! If there are, you'll end up next time you'll be there. I have something to ask. That money, take it, please do. Why? I know you've borrowed a friend for my plane ticket. The reimbursement. If there are, pay my rent. Where did you get so much money? An old customer. It has always beloved. He treats me well. But he is too old for me, I've never thought too much. I met him yesterday, running errands. He insisted me to dinner. I needed money, so I went. After dinner, I told I needed money. He said I could have as many as I wanted. I said to need $ 5000. First, I planned to keep in Singapore. But I use it now. Do not be stupid. You're still young, you have a bright future ahead of you. I borrowed this money from friends. They do not need it right away. Keep it to yourself. Reimburse me later there is no urgency. Why are you so nice to me? It may be fate. Too bad it did not last. I wanted it to last longer. Do not be like that. Let me offer you dinner, tonight. - Boy, the bill! - Immediately. No, let me pay. You are too kind. You have already spent enough time and money for me. I do not want to have to worry. I need a phone call. The addition rule, please. I'll be outside. Want to enter? No, thank you. Rest. I'll see you at the airport tomorrow. No, I beg you. I am terribly sad, if you come. Take good care of you. Why it can not be like before? Do not go. Stay with me tonight. Serve me a hobby. Do you remember? One day you asked me if there was something that I would hire them. I've been thinking about. And now I know there was something I do not praise never in person. In retrospect, it's been the last time we saw each other. I have not seen since that night. Why it can not be like before? It did not turn. It was as if he had embarked on a train destined for a future asleep through the unfathomable night. Each passenger bound for 2046 has the same goal. He wants to find lost memories. Because nothing ever changes in 2046. Nobody knows if it's true or not. Because nobody did not return. English by Radioactiveman.
