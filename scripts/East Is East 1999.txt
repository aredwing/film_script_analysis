Bugger off, bugger off! - Earnest! - Salaam alacum, Mr Shah. - Waalacum-salaam. Ella, Mr Shah. Salaam-alacum. Waalacum-salaam. Salaam-alacum, Mrs Shah. Why's she talking like that? Would you like to come through? - Abdul, salaam-alacum. - Salaam-alacum. - Salaam-alacum. - Waalacum-salaam, Tariq, eh? Salaam-alacum. - Salaam-alacum. - Waalacum-salaam. - Salaam-alacum. - Waalacum-salaam. Sajid, come here. - Please. - Thank you. - 0of... - Is that too low? Uh... So, you found it all right, Mr Shah? The thing is all these houses look the same... To me. [Posh voice] Meenah, would you fetch the tea? Righty-ho. How old are you? Not old enough to get married, so don't ask me. [Laughs] I'm sorry about him, Mr Shah, he's, um... He's just been circumcised. Indeed. Sajid, go see if Saleem here yet. Ah, yes. Your college student. Studying to be an engineer. Ah, here's the tea. [Speaks in Urdu] Where did you get this sari? Me Auntie Riffat in Pakistan. Wear shalwar khameeze, it will look much better than this. Her auntie said lots of girls are wearing saris in Islamabad, and she's quite well-to-do. Riffat bloody stupid. Even in Pakistan, women are getting too bloody moderns. [Tutting] Well, I think it looks lovely. Well, it's just not traditional dress in Pakistan, Mrs Khan. Tradition sees, Ella. [Annie] Coo! 0nly me! I didn't know you had visitors? Annie, this is my friend, Mr Shah. Hello. His daughters go be married Abdul, Tariq. You're lucky you two, aren't you? Landin' a couple of belters like these. Meenah. your sons are joining my family. You've brought them up respectful. You're right there. They're a credit to her. And George. Bring no trouble. [Annie] They'll do anything for you, Mr Shah. Good Samaritans they are, just like in Bible. [Sajid] Mam! Get off! Maneer, cock, go and see what they're up to. - Shut up! - The state of them two! [Meenah] The one with the teeth's got a moustache! [Maneer] Tariq's is like Quasimodo! [Sajid] Mam! - Were yours like that? - No. I believe in firm discipline. Especially in a non-Pakistani environment. Well, I think you can be too harsh, don't you, Annie? can go before I knock him out. Not just me husband, Mrs Shah! [Laughing and snorting] Well, I'd better be going. And congratulations, again. Ta-ra, George. You'd better get changed, they're dying to meet you. [Sajid] That's cheatin'! That the famous sculpture? What you gonna do with that? I'm not gonna do anything with it. 0i! What is it? It's an example of female exploitation in art. Mrs Khan, how do you manage with so many children and such little space? I've got three double beds, and a single for Meenah. But where will you put my daughters? of the chippie with Abdul. Don't worry, it's very roomy. Wouldn't it be more convenient if your sons were to live with us? I thought daughters-in-law lived with their husband's family? Wouldn't you be grateful for the space? I know I would. Excuse me, I'll, um...go and see what's happened to those kids. You should've been here an hour ago. Where's me cigs? Look what's in the box, Mam. You dirty little bastard. Mam, it's Art. I'll Art you, you dirty little sod. I'll burn the bleedin' thing! - No! - Give it here! [Arguing loudly outside] [Saleem] You're pulling all the hair ouuutttt! [Silence] - Ahh! - Waah! What is this thing?! Move it! Take it away from me! I am so sorry, Mrs Shah. The hair came off in me hand. This is an insult to me and my family. I will never allow my daughters to marry into this family of half-breeds! At least they're not friggin' inbred like them monstrosities. - Ella! - Who d'you think you are? Tellin' me my house isn't good enough for your daughters. Your daughters aren't good enough for my sons, or my house. And if I hear another word, I'll stick that fanny over your bastard head. Your wife's a disgrace. Ah, go on, piss off. Go on, sling your bleedin' hook! Go on, piss off! Piss off out of my house! And take Laurel and Hardy with you! [Women screaming and dog barking] You bastard bitch. You bring a shame on our family. No, you should be ashamed, George. 'Cause you're not interested in these kids being happy. You just wanna prove what a great man you are. Because you're ashamed of me and you're ashamed of our kids, and you won't even admit it. - Don't you dare!! - Don't touch her! Bastard! [Abdul] No, Dad! Get off her! Leave her alone! Leave her alone! - Bitch! - Get off! You will not touch her again. No talk like that. No, it's over, finished! Sajid, will you pack it in?! [Ripping] Are you happy? Is this what you wanted? I know what is best for you all. Maneer, you understand me. Son? Got the message? Bastard! All your fault! Calm down, right? I only want to help you, Son. I no want to hurt you. Ella... No, just go, George. Just go. Ella...? [Sobs] Don't cry, it wasn't your fault. Salaam-alacum, Mr Khan. Waalacum-salaam. [Saleem] Should've kicked his head in, Abdul. I couldn't hit me dad. That bastard's not a father. Pack it in, you get on me bleedin' nerves. If it's not you, it's your dad, if it's not your dad, it's you. You're nothing but bleedin' trouble. And you... Pablo bleedin' Picasso. That ''bastard'' that you are talking about is my husband. And whatever you might think of him he is still your father. If I hear another foul-mouthed word, I will have you. Where's Sajid? He ran out. I ripped his hood off. Well, it's a start. [Abdul] Sajid, come on out. Get stuffed. [Abdul] What have I done? [Tearful] You shouted at me for hitting me dad. I know, I'm sorry. Come on out, please. Here. Well?. D'you want it or not? No. Well, stick it in bin, then, eh? [Shutters rise] [Bucket clangs] Want a cup of tea? I'll have half a cup. - All right, Stella? - Piss off. Stella, hey... Hiya, Saleem. What you doin' later? - Drawing. - Can I come? Earnest, look what I got! Whoa! - What is it? - Dunno. Bastard, you said you wouldn't show anyone! - 0i! Mong boy! - I'll fuckin' have ya! [Confused shouts] # M0VING: Supergrass # Where I don't know who I am # No need to follow # There's no way back again # Moving, keep on moving # Where I feel I'm home again # And when it's over # I'll see you again # Got a low, low feeling around me # And a stone-cold feeling inside # And I just can't stop messin' my mind up # And wasting my time, whoo # There's a low low feeling around me # And a stone-cold feeling inside # I've got to find somebody to help me # I keep you in mind #
