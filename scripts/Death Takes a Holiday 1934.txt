Beautiful flowers to a beautiful lady! My dear, I'm not dead yet. I don't need flowers. Half dead, anyway. Oh, you! There. Oh, you beast! Grazia! I thought I'd be back before you missed me. It's getting late. Father's eager to get home. He's expecting Prince Sirki tonight. Here they come. Come along, we're waiting for you. Lambert, sound your horn for Corrado to slow down. I... I've got to catch him first! Your son has no respect for the nerves of your house guests. And he has Grazia with him. Her mother will never forgive us! Apparently my reward for a misspent life is not to be a peaceful death in bed! The strangest shadow is following us. Following? It was right behind us all the time we were racing. It's the shadow of a tree. It isn't a tree. Sometimes it's close by and sometimes we almost lose it. Let's lose it! Let's go fast enough to reach the illimitable! Whatever that is. Oh, it's catching up with us! Stephanie! Stephanie, Are you all right? Quite right, my dear. And the others? It's ridiculous! We all ought to be dead! You, Cesarea? I marvel I'm still alive! Heavens above! The flower vendor! Oh, I'll never forgive myself for this! Flowers, sir? Fresh autumn flowers. You're alive? I think so. Yes, sir. But Celeste... she's hurt? Celeste? You know, there... there was a curious shadow before me. I couldn't even see the cart. It's unbelievable that no one was hurt. Yes. Uh, in case you find any further injury. Yes, Excellenza! Celeste, looka what I got! Whee! Don't tell me we're here, just as if nothing had happened. Nothing did happen. What are we going to do with these lovely flowers? Throw them at people we don't like. You, for instance! Or you! That's for your best... What's going on here? Oooh! That drew blood! Children, children! Those beautiful flowers! Absolutely mad, all of them! Oh, you beast! What a ride. Is my hair completely white? Completely. Help me get this off, will you? We almost had an accident. Almost! We flirted with the coroner's inquest and passed on. What happened, son? Oh, I don't know. My headlights must be out of order. There was a curious shadow in front of me, and I didn't see the cart at all. A shadow... that's odd. And just that last second some instinct told me to swerve. Oh, that instinct came to me somewhat late. I hit the cart. You did, sir? Was anyone hurt? No, nobody hurt, not even the vendor... though he went flying through the air like a great crow. Yes, he did fly a bit, didn't he? Good evening, Fedele. Good evening, Eccellenza, Contessa. I've had a glimpse of deep waters tonight, and I don't like it. You know, there seemed to be something desirable in flying over the edge. I had a curious glimpse of it. Yes, well you ought to take something for that, Alda, and I suggest a whiskey and soda. Thank you. Why are you so silent? What's the matter, darling? You. Oh, don't worry about me, Eric. I'd only disappoint you. Why would you disappoint me? I'm too restless for marriage. Besides, I've had that once. Your whiskey and soda, darling. Ah, thank you. Maria, did you think we were never coming back? No, I've been playing solitaire. Is Grazia with you? Your daughter is in the garden with my son... uh, our son, darling. Grazia, dear. Corrado, isn't this the strangest night? There's something miraculous in the air, like an old story you can't quite believe. I can almost hear a rustling of wings in this garden, in this moonlight. Shall we go in now, dear? Darling, are you all right? Of course, Mother dear. I was so frightened when I heard of your accident. But we had no accident, did we, Corrado? No. I like going fast. It feels like wings. Don't, Grazia. You disturb me when you talk like that. Oh, we think you've been free long enough. When are you going to fold your wings and be my little daughter-in-law? Father's going to build us a villa in the woods, Grazia, just at the top of the cliff. How nice. Thank you, sir. Oh, I'd do anything for you. - Let's make it next month, Grazia. - Do, dear. You could be quite ready in a month. I wish I could, but... We could spend the winter in the Riviera, and in Egypt and Greece. You know how much you want to see the Aegean Isles. It's only a question of making up your mind. You know I love you all, and I want to please you, but I... Don't you see? I'm not ready. But why, Grazia? Because life is too... There's a kind of happiness I want to find first, if I can. Aren't you happy with me? Yes, dear, but that isn't quite what I mean. I wish I knew how to tell you. There's something out there that I must find first... something that I must understand. May I go with you? I'd rather be alone, if you don't mind. Leave her alone, my boy. Life'll tame her fast enough. She worries me so. Oh, I shouldn't worry about her. She's so young, she's just a little frightened at the whole idea. Bad evening for you, dear? She's so lovely, Mother. Yes... delicate, so fine. You'll win her. If I deny every human impulse, if I live only in music and poetry. But love is music, and love is poetry! But Mother, one can't live on beauty alone. For instance, one occasionally likes a drink. Tonight I'd like a dozen after what I've been through. You'll never win her that way. I know, Mother. She loves you. I'm sure of it. And I love her till I'm half mad with it, and there's nothing to do! - What on earth was that? - It's Grazia! Where is she? Is she hurt? What's the matter with her? What happened? I don't know. She was just lying here. Get her into the house, quick. Here, is she wounded? It's all right, it's all right. Get the couch ready for her. Here, right here, Corrado. There, on the sofa. Is there brandy, there? Brandy, quick! Here, lift her up a little, here. Poor child. Poor child. Oh, poor little dear. No, she can't take this yet. Don't let it come in! Oh, please don't cry so! What do you suppose happened? Some prowler may have frightened her. Too much moonlight. She'll come around. If anyone's harmed her... Eric, take Fedele and search the grounds. Yes, sir. Grazia! It's Mother! What frightened you? Darling, try to tell us what happened. I don't know. There was something cold and terrible. I was sitting by the fountain, watching the water. I could hear the music. And then a shadow blew over. That's what it was, a shadow. It's all right, Grazia. You're safe now. And then an icy wind touched me, but it wasn't a wind because all the leaves were still. Perhaps you fell asleep, and dreamed. No, I saw it! What? What did you see? A shadow, an enormous darkness. And yet it wasn't a shadow, because the moon shone through it. Oh, Corrado, I felt something behind me, running. There wasn't any sound, but I felt someone! It's all right, Grazia. It all comes of this fast driving. You scare everybody to death. Yes, yes, that's it, of course. I-It was the drive... and the danger. Something touched me... something cold! We'll have to get her to bed at once. You must stay here tonight, Maria. So many guests! Nonsense, Maria. Cora! Go and get the room ready. Ridiculous when you can't go into your own garden without being frightened to death. I've told Lambert time and time again we should have a watchman for this place. It's much too big. Maria? Yes, dear? Give Corrado your jewels to put in the safe. If they're going to rob us, they shan't find anything. There, there. You'll be in bed in just a minute and you'll feel much better. Lambert? Tell Fedele to lock up the silver... all the silver! Alda, would you mind if I slept in your room tonight? I'm still tingling from that scream. You know, I rather wish you would. I don't want to be alone, either. I thought you modern girls had no nerves. - Hah! Have you none? - None at all! Great Scott! Midnight, and everyone calm and collected... even the baron. Come along, Rhoda. I think I'll feel safer in bed. So shall I. Good night. Good night. Good night, Rhoda. Good night, Alda. These children go too fast. None of them'll live as long as I have. Will you be sure to lock all the doors? I'll-I'll see to it. Good night. Good night. Well, he got away... if there was anyone. We've searched the grounds thoroughly, sir. Not a sign of anyone. Did you go as far as the lake? Yes, sir. Would you like me to make the rounds of the house with you, sir? Oh, no. Fedele will look after that. Thank you, Eric. Then if you don't mind, sir, I think I'll go up to bed. Quite all right. Good night. Good night, sir. Will Your Grace have the curtains drawn? Uh, what? Oh, no, no. You can leave them. Uh, put out some of the lights. Yes, sir. Will there be anything further, Your Grace? No. No, thank you, Fedele. Good night. Good night, sir. Who's there? Who's there? Answer or I'll shoot! It's quite useless against me. Who're you? Is this some horrible masquerade? If it is... No. Strange as it may seem, this is my natural appearance. Seems incredible, doesn't it? You see, I am not of your world. I am... how shall I describe it? A sort of vagabond of space. I am the point of contact... between eternity and time. Do I make myself clear? Evidently not. I told you it would be difficult. Perhaps you'd better sit. No, no, no. Here. Your back may need support. You see, I am... or I was, until I crossed your threshold... Death. But please be reassured. I am not on my usual mission tonight. I have already stood beside one of your number tonight, without harm... that lovely girl in the garden. Ah, then... then it was you! Yes. Doesn't that reassure you that I have no fatal intentions? Yes, yes, it-it does, rather. That's better. In a moment, we shall be, I trust, quite good friends. I am about to take a holiday. I shall take only three days. After that, I must go back. Why... why do you do this? For a number of reasons. For one thing, to discover why men fear me as they do. Do-Don't you know? How should I know? What could terror mean to me who have nothing to fear? Can you conceive how weary I am of always being misunderstood? I see things that are gracious... and young and fragrant. But if I come too near, if they feel the presence of my shadow, a horror comes upon their minds. If I touch a flower, it dies in my grasp. Can you conceive how lonely I am... when there is nothing that doesn't shun me, that doesn't fade as I come near? Yes. Yes, of course. There is something here to be known and felt... something desirable that makes men fear me and cling to their life. I must know what it is. Will you accept me for these few days as a guest? As a guest! Oh, don't be alarmed! As a mortal, of course. I assure you, I shall be quite a man of the world. Yes, oh, well, of course in that case, I, uh... I should be most happy. That's extremely kind of you. Will it be a great trouble for you to put me up? Well? Oh, no, no, no. Not at all, not at all! I have a suite of rooms prepared for an old friend who is expected... uh, Prince Sirki. Indeed? Prince Sirki of Vitalba Alexandri? Yes. Prince Sirki will not come to see you... not in this life. Oh, I... I understand. Was the Prince known to your family and your guests? No. Excellent! I shall be Prince Sirki of Vitalba Alexandri for three days. What? Please understand that my presence in your house will not be a menace, but a protection. Thank you. On one condition, on which I shall insist. Yes? I am to be Prince Sirki, no other. I shall be a mortal, and I must be treated as a mortal in every particular. No one under this roof shall show repulsion or fear, on pain of my instant displeasure. I understand. If my secret is divulged, I shall leave instantly... and return in my proper person. Do I make myself clear this time? I understand, Your Highness. I am to become a mortal. I shall feel blood in my veins, the warm blood of life. I shall feel my desire becoming flesh... and my hunger taking on the fire of blood. I shall know what you know and feel what you feel. My hunger shall be appeased for an hour... my hunger that is as old as time. And those that I love need not be afraid. Not afraid! Not afraid! I am beside myself. My holiday is just caprice... a mad joke I play with life. But what a monstrous, what a sublime joke! I, Death, do hereby take on the world, the flesh and the devil! Stop him, stop him! Your Grace, what is it? Corrado, for heaven's sake! Corrado, stop, man! Come back instantly! Shall I call the servants, Your Grace? No, no. Turn on the lights. What is it? What's happened? We heard shots. Lambert, are you hurt? No, no one's hurt. Fedele? Yes, sir? Prepare the rooms in the left wing. That was a messenger. We... we are to have a visitor. A messenger? Father, are you all right? Yes. Yes. I... I don't see why your pistol fired. Mine didn't. What do you mean? Oh. Oh, nothing, nothing. Will somebody quit firing cannon under my windows? I was just on the point of getting to sleep. Fedele, I told you to get those rooms ready instantly! Rooms for whom? He said something about a guest. Corrado saw a fellow running in the garden, and fired at him. Now it turns out he was a messenger. Yes, yes, that's it. He was a messenger from... from Prince Sirki. Ooh, so he's coming at last. Yes, he's coming, all right. You shouldn't fire at people you don't know. No, you-you might have angered him. Hmm. I should think it might anger a man to fill him full of holes! When is he coming, Lambert? Tonight... at once. Oh, my goodness! I want to tell you all something very seriously. This guest whom we're expecting is no ordinary person. Now, if he should appear eccentric, or... or strange in any way, take no notice. Treat him as a... as a prince and a gentleman, always. And above all, you mustn't be afraid. But Lambert, I don't understand. And no matter what happens, you must never shun him, or protest, or... or run... or run. Oh, it would do any good if you did. You can't run from things like that! I don't think I want to stay here. Oh, you must! You-you-you must stay! You must all remain if you value your lives... or mine, or anything else in this world. His Highness, Prince Sirki. Sirki! Well? Uh, welcome, Your Highness, to the Villa of Contentment. Thank you, my dear duke. I am happy to be here. We are more than honored, Your Highness. And now, may I present my wife... La Duchessa di Catolica. Your Highness is most welcome. Thank you. I have rarely been so charmingly received. And now, Your Highness, may I present the rest of my guests? It would be a pleasure. La Contessa di Parma. May I say that I had not realized that the women of your country were so beautiful. Your Highness is most kind. I wish that we might never meet... when you are less beautiful, and I must be... less kind. Miss Rhoda Fenton, Your Highness. Ah, young and firm and full of life! And it lies so trustingly in mine! Hmm. Thank you, Miss Fenton. You have done me a kindness tonight. The Baron Cesarea, sir. A statesman important in the affairs of the world, who now looks back upon a long and interesting life. I am delighted to meet the baron, at last. And I to meet you, Your Highness. Considering your distinction and age, it is surprising that fate has not introduced us before. Uh, Mr. Eric Bagley, Your Highness. My son, Corrado. Ah, the son who drives so furiously! My friends... permit me to call you my friends. Your Highness. Make no change in your plans because of my sudden appearance. I should like to join in your pleasures, if I may. I beg you not to make a stranger of me. Oh, uh, well, will... will Your Highness... will Your Highness take some little refreshment? Uh, refreshment? Yes, a glass of wine. Oh. Oh, yes. Yes, a glass of wine. Yes, yes. Corrado! Oh, let me do it. I have never tasted wine... of your country! May I drink to this delightful household? I believe that is one of your customs, is it not? It is, Your Highness, and for myself and my guests, I thank you. Oh, no, allow me. Your Highness. Thank you. To this household, to life, and to all brave illusion. Yes, wait a minute. Ah, I think I shall enjoy your wine. It goes pleasantly in my veins. Yes, it is a consolation at times. Hmm, you see? Already I have learned one fact of importance. - The rooms are ready, Your Grace. - Oh, yes. My rooms? Uh, yes, Your Highness. At your pleasure. Mmm. If you will forgive me, I think I will go now. Good night, my friends. Good night, Your Highness. My holiday begins most agreeably. Your Highness, may I present the Princess of San Luca... and her daughter, Grazia. Principessa! Principessa! A miracle! A miracle! In the night, the autumn bush is covered with fresh roses! We must send tidings to the priest. He will want to bless the sacred bush. I'm afraid the good father will be very busy. Look, all the bushes and vines have fresh buds! Good morning! Good morning, Your Highness. Damn! Are you getting up? Say, there's something wrong about this. It's only 9:30, and you never get up before 12:00. Go to sleep, darling. Oh, I remember! We're to have breakfast on the terrace. He's here... the prince. Well? Nothing, except you meant to steal a march on me! Not at all, my dear. You're a very sound sleeper. I tried and tried to wake you. I did sleep. You know, this is going to be one of my good days. I hope so, Rhoda dear, for you sake. Pretty. Where'd you get it? You can't have him, my dear, so you needn't plan on it. How far do you go, as a rule? Well, with him... anything. - Wait for me till I have my bath? - Nope. All right. It's a war! Wear your prettiest thing, darling! Princess! I'm not myself a princess, you know. Let me call you so. In mockery? No, no, quite really. You shall have a rose for that. Oh, no, no! They wither on me. There are people like that, you know, who-who wither the flowers they wear. Please! This one's hardly opened yet. It'll last a long time. This... Uh, Thank you. Good morning! Good morning, my dear. Good morning, Your Highness. Good morning! You slept well, I trust? As I never slept before! Uh, Grazia, you will breakfast with us? No, lazybones. I had my breakfast hours ago. What will Your Highness take for breakfast? Well, to tell the truth, I have never given much thought to my diet. May I... may I suggest a little... Cora, have you seen my other shoe? Why don't you wear another pair? No, these match my dress so nicely. Why, here's your shoe, my dear! I was sitting on it all the time! You! Oh... Good morning, good morning! You're looking well, Baron. Last night I suddenly said to myself, "Why get older? Why give into it?" And from that moment, I've felt younger. Hmm. And it seems to be linked with your arrival. You're not a physician, by any chance? I, uh, have something in common with them. You know, not in years have I felt as I do this morning about food, and about everything. A little of that, Fedele, thank you. I've had to be careful... about eating and drinking... no appetite. Indeed. I've been much too careful. From now on, I'm going to act like the young bloods... eat, drink and make love. Who's the lucky girl, Baron? Never mind, now, never mind! You keep out of my way, you young whippersnapper! Be careful, Eric. Don't cross him! I shall be a four-bottle man again. You know what that means? Very well. I have known many four-bottle men. They were so cheerful. - They were not even afraid of me. - Afraid of you? Well, I, uh... I have been known to inspire fear. So sorry, darling! Good morning, good morning! Good morning! How are you? Good morning! No, no, Your Highness. Don't get up. I'm simply starved! No wonder, darling, the way you rushed dressing. Well, come along. Move over! What? Give me some room, please! And how are you this glorious morning? Very well, thank you. Have any of you seen this account of the man... who jumped off the Eiffel Tower last night and picked himself up unhurt? No. Poor fellow! Tsk, tsk, tsk. He was probably desperately unhappy. I should do something about that. You? I, uh... I might write him a note of condolence. What a divine sense of humor! I am glad somebody is beginning to realize that. But seriously, I feel somehow personally responsible. As if you'd neglected something. Exactly! Well, it just wasn't time for the Old Man to take him. I beg your pardon, "the Old Man"? Oh! Oh, yes, the Old Man! I can assure you that if the Old Man were always so neglectful, there would be serious overcrowding. I think that's a possibility most of us would be willing to risk. Then, there's this situation on the Algerian front. Big night attack planned, then nothing functions. Something wrong with the powder. Don't worry, my friend. Your sacred privilege of blowing each other to bits... is quite safe. Good morning, good morning. Ah, the mother of the beautiful Grazia! Good morning. - Maria feels they must go home. - Some of your guests are leaving? Th-Th-The Princess and Grazia were only here for the night, Your Highness. Uh, Maria, won't you consider remaining a little longer? We shall miss you, you know. I'm sorry. No. No we shall. Good-bye. Good-bye. I'm to go home at once, it seems. I am sorry. You're not to be here long? Three days, in all. Coming, darling? Yes, Corrado. Good-bye, Your Highness. Good-bye. I'm afraid I'm sorry to go. It has been a great pleasure. Come, dear. The car's waiting. Good-bye. Good-bye. Good-bye, Grazia. Your Highness, they were not house guests. They were only here last night because... because Grazia had been very frightened. Ah, yes... in the garden. Yes. She is so young. And so lovely. It is well for you, my friend, that she went reluctantly. Your Highness, you forbid me to tell them who you are. My control is not absolute! It is unimportant. She will return. Prince Sirki, it's such a gorgeous day. How shall we spend it? Is that what one does with a day... spend it? Mmm. In my time, we merely filled in the days. We spent the nights. Ah, your days were glamorous, Cesarea! Five beautiful creatures depended on me, all at one time, for their pleasure... and profit. Think of the fatigue! Come on, we're going to see that your three days are never to be forgotten. No? Countess Alda, are you not coming? Oh, yes, I'm still in the party. Mm-hmm. I suggest we go to the Villa Surbolonie for lunch. No, then we'll miss the yacht races. Oh, my! I can't believe it! It's a miracle they weren't all killed! I know I saw that horse step on him. Perhaps it, uh... it just was not time for the Old Man to take him, hmm? Positively, you must come over and watch him! He's doubled seven times on the six. If he's right once more he'll own the place! Six! But you shouldn't double again. Shouldn't I? Oh, no. You'll lose it all! Shall I or not? Yes, play it. I think the world's all yours tonight, to do with as you choose. Shall I? Yes, play it. Play it all! Your Highness, I am very sorry, it's against the rules of the house to double again. Well, but you make it... you make it necessary... for me to take a great deal of this... this metal away with me. I'm sorry, Your Highness. Oh, thank you! Thanks, Your Highness. Giving it to me? For me? Me too! All down. He must be very rich! He's very exciting, but we don't seem to be to him. Out here is the night, crowded with beauty... and you herd inside in smoky rooms, feverish over little games... why? Why, one comes here to gamble, and one gambles to win. Hmm. It seems to me that men have not begun to discover the magnificence of this life. Will you tell me what in the world you're looking for? I came here looking for a game to play... a game worth playing. I have been among you two days, and what you do with yourselves... still seems so very futile and empty. There are only three games: Money, love and war. - Have you tried war? - Plenty of it. I could never make out what it was they were fighting about. It's usually a flag, isn't it? Or a barren piece of ground that neither side wants. Well, I suppose they... they fight to make themselves heroic for someone they love. Ah, so! It all comes down to one game. One game... that's what it comes to. Hmm. One never grows tired of love. Shall I tell you something, Baron? This last great game of yours, this of which you never tire, seems to me to be the strangest, the saddest, the emptiest of all. Can it be that you're inexperienced in such matters? Entirely. Oh. You don't know what you've missed. One pair of lips will change your mind for you someday. Whose mind do you want changed? I'm good at that. Hah! I have found the Americans a most engaging race. Yes? They proceed with such disarming directness toward what they want. And right now, this American wants to walk in the garden. You'll excuse us? Certainly. I'm the last man in the world to interfere with romance. You know, uh, I have had great pleasure... in watching you these... these two days. Thank you. It is peculiarly refreshing to me to be near someone... who is so... so very fit, huh? Well, I do have that to recommend me. I am healthy. And I have known so much of illness that I... I take a singular interest in young and budding life... in vigor, in bloom. Oh, please don't stop. In what key shall I go on? Say anything. Uh, Miss Fenton, what-what is love? What does it mean to you? Why... why to find some splendid man who loves you too. Like myself, perhaps? Yes. And to live with him the rest of your life. Um, but if the rest of one's life... were only a few days or a few hours, would that be enough to justify love? What a morbid idea! Morbid? You know, I've noticed that about you. You're inclined to be a little... Well, perhaps it's the foreigner in you. And, uh, you find the trait distasteful. Oh, no. I think you're fascinating. Uh, at any rate, I... I have your answer. Why, I don't remember saying no. I suppose what I really meant is, uh, that I am not a marrying man. Oh, is that all! I don't care. I don't care, really, with you. I don't care at all. Hmm, it's interesting... very. What? What such a suggestion does to one. This strange... almost the beginning of an emotion... which one feels. Did you bring me out here to analyze me? Yes, or to analyze myself, perhaps. But it is amazing how the pulses stir at the mention of such subjects. Even with me! Yes! I did not believe the baron, but this promises to be really interesting. So you've discussed it all with the baron! Oh, there is no doubt of it... I have offended you! You have! Forgive me. Oh, easily. If I'm not your type, well, I'm just not your type! The baron will be disappointed. His Eminence, Cardinal de Valle. Their Excellencies, the Ambassador of Spain and Madame Monte. Kind of Your Eminence to come. I am glad to be with you. Excellency. Hello, Signor, Duchessa. Mademoiselle, vous etes ravissante. Comme un reve. Yes? Vos yeux sont tres brillants. Well, I don't know just what that means in English, but if it sounds like the French... Your Highness perhaps does not care for dancing? Oh, yes. I found it somewhat stifling inside. I had hoped to make your last evening, uh... Yes, my last evening. I leave at midnight. Don't let me keep you from your guests. Eric, who is this Prince? What is he, he draws and frightens us all so? Alda, are you in love with him? Fascinated, completely. My darling, can't you think yourself out of this? It's not only that I'm jealous, but I'm worried about you. Come on. Let's dance. I'm too restless to dance. Let's go into the garden, then. Not now. Dreaming? Yes, things impossible. Tell me. You are so fortunate here. I think I used to despise you all, with your little whims and desires, all leading up to nothing. Now there is nothing I want so much as to share them, and I cannot. I was just thinking all that of myself. My dear countess, you can have whatever dreams you wish. But suppose you had been set down, for a few hours or a few days, among the inhabitants of the moon, and that was all the life you could have forever... you knew no one there, and no one dared to know you? Do you really feel that? I am not one of you. Then I wish that you were. You do? I've waited for someone like you. Even though I am not what I seem? You are, though. No. I am a fear, a shadow, a wandering thing. Isn't there a story among your legends... of a merman who came asking a woman to love him... so that he might have a soul? Well, if there is, I'm sure she gave him what he asked. She'd give up her own soul gladly. If she were in love. Yes, if she were in love. You see, I have come asking for that. Of me? Yes. But also, it is impossible. Why? Because you will take one step toward me... and know my secret, and lose courage. Try me. You can give me a soul only if you know me and can still love me. Look into my eyes. Look deep. What do you see there? Shadows. Look into those shadows. Let your thought go to its wildest reach. I will you to know who I am! No, no! I want to live! Eric! Eric! Eric! Eric! What is it, darling? What's the matter? I don't know, only keep me away from him! There's no danger, darling. What danger could there be? Oh, keep back... keep back all of you! How do you know when he'll strike? Alda, Alda, be quiet! Why, there's nothing to harm you! Alda, my dear. Tell me what's happened. Nothing! I don't know! I don't know! Sir, it's evident that your presence here is unwelcome. It has been made apparent in many ways. Why are you among us? Corrado, he's my guest! Guest or not, I'll ask him what I like, and he'll answer. My father says he has cause to fear you. Who are you? Corrado! I'm afraid I have no answer for you, nor for anyone. I warn you, however... I've heard that warning before. Would you threaten the stars because you dislike your destiny? I came among you to warm my hands at your fires... your poor, pitiful little fires that flicker out in the night. Well, let them all go out! One means no more to me than another. Let them all go out, if only I can save one spark for the eternal cold! Go. Go, Corrado. Go instantly. Let me speak to His Highness. Corrado. Grazia's here. She's looking for you. All right, Mother. Your Highness, I hope that you... I have been caught in this web of flesh, Duke Lambert... caught and tortured. I thought to put it on like a garment and cast it off as easily. But to put it off is to die... to die without having lived! To die alone, without loving or being loved, and that I will not have. But your promise... your promise to harm no one. What does my promise matter when I set it against this torture I feel? What if there should be one death among you? You have years to live, have you not? Years! And I have what remains of this day. The very lovely and serene princess of all delight. My name is Grazia. How charming of you. Grazia, then. You make it sound like music. It is like music. It has overtones that go singing on and on. But they are not sad. They are full of grace and light. When you speak like that, I hear music, too... great sweeping chords. May I? I could say so much more. Your Highness is being very kind tonight. Hmm. I wonder if I am... being kind. Perhaps I should have said gracious. No, no. Not gracious, either. I have learned that even the mightiest... must sue for certain favors. Well, perhaps you're unfamiliar with this custom, also. When a gentleman is tapped on the shoulder, he releases the lady to another partner. I am grateful for the explanation. I myself have touched many shoulders, but, uh, for other reasons. Grazia, why did you come? Oh, I don't know. I kept wanting to. I wanted to see you too, but... I didn't want you to come just now. Will you do me a great favor? If I can. May I stay close to you this evening? Why? Because... I love you, and I'm afraid. But there's nothing to be afraid of, Corrado. You don't know. Yes, I do. And I'm happy to be here. I wanted to come. You mean you know what we're afraid of? Yes. And it doesn't frighten you? No. Grazia, come back to me. There's some terrible danger. No, not danger... happiness. Grazia. Please don't be unhappy, Corrado. I love you in some way I can't quite make clear. If I didn't feel so far away, I'd be in your arms now, crying and holding you close to me. I want to do that, but somehow, I think I never shall. Grazia, you're trembling. I feel a little cold. Will you get my cloak from the hall? Yes. Yes, of course. The buffet is served, Eccellenza. What? Oh, yes. Yes, thank you, Fedele. You are cold. Yes. Grazia! Father, what is it? What? Oh, nothing, nothing. Where are you going? Why, Grazia wanted her cloak. Oh, no. Not now. Why? Why not? Prince Sirki has brought her a cloak. Prince Sirki! Father, she's hypnotized, fascinated. We must save her from him! No, we can do nothing. What do you mean? If we could, should I be standing here now? Lambert, what is it? Oh, nothing, nothing. Grazia's gone out into the garden with Prince Sirki. Prince Sirki? Why not? What's wrong? Oh, Grazia's in no danger. What's happened, sir? There's nothing to be alarmed about. But you're alarmed, Father. You're terrified. There is some danger. Oh, let me go to her. No, no. Wait, wait. Then I'll go. No, I forbid you. You're risking your life. My life... what's my life or yours? You said you'd die for Grazia. I would if it would save her. Father, tell me who this prince is. I'll know or I'll kill him! Kill him! Why, if he but put out his hand, it'd mean your life. I don't care. I only know that Grazia's in danger. No, no! Wait, wait, wait! He's not Prince Sirki! He... No, no. Don't tell, don't tell! He is the one whom all men dread. He is Death! What do you mean? His Majesty, Death, amusing himself on a holiday. No, no, Lambert! Amusing himself with love. Now, you take one step to save her and she's lost. If you won't think of yourselves, think of her. Perhaps you can tell me what I have been doing. I think I can, almost. Tell me. I think you've been holding life in your hands, as I do sometimes. I think you've been a little afraid of its beauty. Oh, you do know. Child. Child, something new has been born in me, and I know the meaning of this life men lead here. A moment ago I knew only that men were dust, and their end was dust. And now suddenly I know for the first time... that men bear a dream within them... a dream that lifts them above their dust... and their little days. And you have brought this to me. I look at the stars in the water, Grazia, and you have given them a meaning. I feel the earth under me. It's no longer the earth which men become, but a world which you have made for me which we share together. And yet, I am alone too. Still alone. I think we'll never be alone again. It comes easily to you, Grazia. But for me, I shall hear your laughter in every wind that passes. I shall hear your footsteps wherever you are, when our two worlds hold us apart. Why should we ever be apart? Oh, what is this that's happened? Who are you? - Sirki. - I don't mean that. You seem to come from a distant place. When I'm with you, I see depths in your eyes that are like the worlds I visit in sleep, and beneath your words is a sound I've heard in dreams. And when you leave me, the light goes from the sky. You're like the mystery that's just beyond sight and sound, always just beyond my reach. Something that draws and... and frightens me. Oh, Grazia, Grazia, don't be afraid of me. I am Sirki who loves you, more than any man could love you. I am Sirki who needs your warmth and your beauty... more than any man could need it. I say your name over and over, until the music runs through my soul. Listen to me, Grazia. I am a great power, and I am humble before you. And tonight I must go back to my... my distant kingdom. Will you take me with you? Take you? I should be so unhappy... alone. Take you? Oh, no, no. Don't tempt me. But Grazia, give me one hour of you. Let me hold you once and feel your life. You are the meaning of beauty that I must know. Oh, Grazia, let me hold you, let me feel that last ecstasy... and know that I have lived. Oh, my love! My love! Do you think he'll surely come? Oh, yes. I think he'll come back and say goodbye to his friends. But Grazia... I don't know. Perhaps he will be kind. He may take Grazia, or... all of us. We have courage for that, sir. I think you're all wrong to be afraid. I talked to him about dying, and he said, "Has it ever occurred to you that death may be simpler than life, "and infinitely more kind?" He said that? Yes. And when he spoke, I had a curious feeling that somehow he knew. So, you have broken your promise. Yes. I was desperate, sir. It was my son's life against my promise. I had no choice. I am not used to these distinctions! I thought we should part as friends, with kindly remembrances, but now my shadow has come between us. Surely not already. No. I am a mortal, still, for a few minutes. No longer as Prince Sirki of Vitalba Alexandri, but as myself, with my own feelings. In a few moments, I shall be what I was, and for me, too, there will be an end. But you're above pain and loss. Am I? I thought tonight I had reached the end of my experiment. I had found love. But it was not the end. Beyond that, I have found the pain of losing love... if I must lose it. But it must be lost to you! Why? Because you are... Death! Death! My dear duke, thank you for defining the problem. Your Highness, won't you give her back to me? You who have been cruel often, will be again. But must you be cruel to me this one time? It's your pain against mine. But I gave her to life! To life, not to... Why should I deny myself because of your childish fear? You know nothing of the meaning of death. You're speaking of your own need, not hers. I'm asking for her life. A life which I must sometime take. But she's so young! I tell you, to go with me now, in love, would be triumph, not death as it is known to you. Oh, in God's name! Lambert! Give her back to me. One lover must always lose. But not like this, not with death. There are worlds between us, and I cannot reach your minds. Why do men fear my coming? You have ten minutes more of life. After that, what can you give her? Sleep, perhaps, and the release of dreams. And beyond that... There are no words by which to tell you. But that is death to us, and to her. A word you have been taught to fear. A symbol of the unknown, and because of that word, you would keep her from me. I would only lead her through the gateway... to the life that lies beyond. Your Highness, we are not answered. Are we to keep Grazia? - Is she yours even now? - But she doesn't know who you are. Now, if she knew, what would she choose? Yes, even Grazia was born to fear the face of death. She would die with me now, as Sirki. - I cannot tell her! - You gave me your word. And you think me bound by that? I do. An honorable man would be bound. Because I assume your flesh, must I assume your weakness, too? Then pity our weakness. I've seen pity struggling in you. We beg the life of Grazia. I bound myself to life, and with it to the little rules by which it is lived. And now I must bow to it. What a monstrous comedy! Where's he going? To fetch Grazia. Oh, what will he do? What will he do? Oh, now, now. Wait, Maria. Wait. She will come. You will give her back? No! It is for you to call her back. For us? She is coming. Your Highness, did you call? Grazia! Oh, Grazia, darling, I've been so frightened! So frightened! Grazia, don't run away like that again, not in the night. But I was quite safe with him, Mother. I love to be with him. I must stay with him always. I know he seems a little terrifying to you, but I'm happy with him, and safe. He's kind, Mother, and more tender than anyone I've ever known... even more tender than you. Don't, Grazia. You don't know what you're saying. Why are you all so strange? Why are you suffering so? I've found my love. There ought to be lights and music. Save her! Tell her what you will. What is there to tell? Do you think there's anything I don't understand? I love His Highness, and I must go with him. Your Highness, you must. Say what you like. It will make no difference. You must! It's nearly twelve! I know. Grazia, I came to this house as a jest, made love to you as a jest. You're trying to destroy my love because they wish it. - It was not a jest. - Someone tell her quickly, while there's time. Corrado, she's cold. Take her in your arms. Grazia, Grazia, don't you hear me? Yes, I hear. Grazia, dear, won't you stay with me? I can't, Corrado. But I shall always love you. Grazia, listen. You must stay here with those who love you. If you went with me now, you could never see them again. Why must you say these things to me? They can make no difference. But you don't understand. My holiday is over. I am going at once. I'm ready. Oh, no. You can't come with me. Yes, I can. Shall we go now? But you... you don't know who I am! You are my love... my love! You heard? And you wish me to speak and destroy this happiness? You must. Oh, Grazia, my little love, it was not a jest. Goodbye, my friends. Remember that there is only a moment of shadow... between your life and mine. And when I call, come bravely through that shadow... And you will find me only your familiar friend. Goodbye, Grazia. Now you see me as I am. But I've always seen you like that. You haven't changed. You have seen me... like this? Yes, always. Then there is a love which casts out fear, and I have found it! And love is greater than illusion... and as strong as death.
