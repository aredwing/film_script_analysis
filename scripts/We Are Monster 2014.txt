On your knees, hands behind your head! (INDISTINCT CONVERSATION) ALTER EGO: You done it, lad, done us proud. Now you're a monster. A proper monster. (CELL DOOR BUZZING) (DOOR OPENS) New arrival from Kingfisher. Robert Stewart. We're almost at capacity here, they're trying to give us all nervous breakdowns or what? He's asking for trouble... Thought so. Back with us again. Had him before when he was here for his court case. Says here he's only in for harassment of a chat-line operator this time. Not much in the way of a security file or medical records. Looks like he's gonna be a lot of fun, though. Sound of body, if not of mind, eh? We've got a prisoner, Robert Stewart. How many cells we got with a space? Any singles? No singles. What about cell 38? He'd be sharing with Mubarek. Mubarek? Asian lad. He's out in a few weeks. No trouble. He's all right. Right. All right, cell 38 it is, then. I'm sure they'll become fast friends in no time. Should be a bit of a laugh, eh? Okay lads, take him through. Right, Stewart, follow me. (DOOR BUZZING) (INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS) What? (INDISTINCT CONVERSATION) (EXCLAIMING) (KEYS JINGLING) (DOOR UNLOCKING) Come in, Stewart. (SNICKERING) You all right? Zahid. What you in here for, man? Not in for nothing, mate. I'm in here for nicking razor blades, man. Joke's that I'm even in here. Well, I'll be out in six weeks, at least. You've been inside before, bruv? Take that as a yes, man. You know... Don't have to talk if you don't want to, you know. It's not a thing. No problem, bruv. (INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS) ALTER EGO: All right, lad? (GROANING) ALTER EGO: They ain't got a clue about you, have they? Thought you'd done one. Me? (SCOFFS) No, I'm never gone. Not when you need me most. Clueless, aren't they? No medical, no security files, no discharge reports. Fucking useless, right? Yeah. Fucking useless too, right, mate. But don't worry, I'll look after ya, 'cause you're all alone now, aren't you? We're gonna show you how to become a monster. 'Cause you ain't a monster yet, are ya? No. But you want to be a monster though, right? Let me tell you something. We're gonna make you one. Because it's us against them out there. The fucking Pakis and the niggers, the do-gooders and all those darkie-loving cunts! Yeah. Tell me more. That's what I've been saying, no one's been listening to me. Oh, I will, lad. I'm gonna show you the world for what it really is. 'Cause only now are you ready to reach your potential. These fucking parasites and their nigger-loving cunts have fucked everything for us. The teachers we had, the psychiatrists we saw, the filth. And don't forget our dear old mum and dad, eh? They been fucking ya from the day you were born. They all have. Yeah. They all been out to get me. I been there with you the whole time, I seen it. I seen it all. I don't remember. I just hate them... I hate them all. I remember, don't you worry. I was there, weren't I? Dad were nasty to us, hitting us, threatened our mum, too. You remember this, don't ya? (OFF-KEY MUSIC PLAYING) (PROJECTOR WHIRRING) (CLASSICAL MUSIC PLAYING) (SNORING) (WHISTLING) ALTER EGO: Dad was scary, right? (TOY BREAKING) (FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING) (ALTER EGO LAUGHING) Look at that brother of ours hiding. He was a fucking wimp, our Ian was. We was all wimps. Pathetic. Crying and whining. MOTHER: What's wrong with you? I fucking saw you... Chatting to that darkie from your work... God's sake, it were nothing... Fucking darkie was touching you! - You some sort of slut? - (BREATHING HEAVILY) Putting it out to darkies now, are ya? - (SLAPPING) - FATHER: Shit! (BOYS SOBBING) Shut it, you little rats! (FATHER WHIPPING) (BOYS SOBBING) (WHIPPING CONTINUES) Fucking cunt. ALTER EGO: That's it. You're getting it. We'll show 'em. But we got some educating to do first. Need to show you everything. Take a seat. Here. What is it? Our mum... She did nowt. Yeah. Fuckin' nowt. Never did nothing for us, did she? As bad as Dad, she was. You see her? Our mum? MOTHER: I'll send you away, be done with you. Wetting the bed, for fuck's sake! At your age! You dirty, little shit! A right fucking picture of love and tenderness, eh? Done it again, has he? I'll fucking do ya, teach you not to ever wet your bed. You hear me, you little shit? FATHER: I'll fuck you up. (VOICE ECHOING) Yeah? How 'bout this? (FATHER SLAPPING) (GRUNTING) (FATHER SHOUTING) What was it that psychiatrist said about her? Don't remember. No. You mean, you don't want to remember. We've spoken before about your mummy, haven't we, Robert? Do you feel happy when you're with your mum? (PLAYING WITH TOY) Robert? Robert? Yeah, better that way. For now. You ain't ready. It's just me and you. No, I don't need no one. I survived by myself, didn't I? What, like you did in Hindley once Trav got done? Do me a fucking favor... That were us, you know. And were all our fault. Were it? Let me show you, lad. (PROJECTOR WHIRRING) AVERILL: Fuck are you looking at? Fucking looking, eh? ALTER EGO: Look at Averill. That dirty fucking nigger. (ARGUING) ALTER EGO: You goaded him, didn't you? You pushed him into it. You gave him that blade. (ARGUING CONTINUES) (STABBING) You wanted him to bleed, Averill, didn't you? Yeah, I fucking did. Averill were fucking bullying us, weren't he? Good. Now that is what I want to hear. And no more of all that attention-seeking shite. Like trying to harm yourself. (TSK-TSKING) That's what you thought we wanted. But it weren't, were it? No. You and Travis, swallowing nasty stuff, screws, soap... Cutting yourselves. TRAVIS: What are you doing? Eh? Brought you out, lad. Feels good. Feels real good. I know. Pain. It's nice. We could do this proper, you know. Do it together, like. Like, show them some blood? Get let out of here for a bit? They'd send us to hospital. Yeah, they might. Could be good for our case, too. Fuck knows. Eh? It'd mean a fucking break from here, though. You up for it, lad, eh? Oh, I'm up for it. Don't you worry. When he turns, all right? (GROANING) (LAUGHING) (INDISTINCT CONVERSATION) (CONVERSATION CONTINUES) (LAUGHING) It's driving me nuts in here. Can't take much more. I'm gonna snap. Reminds me how I felt in Hindley. They all think I'm mad. No, we'll fucking show 'em what madness is, eh, lad? Or are we going mad? Or are we already? Fucking place is driving me nuts, too. - Whoo! - Shh. (INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS) People make us mad, though. Like that slut off the chat line. Oh, we freaked her out though, didn't we? (STEAM BLOWING) Now bend over. (ROBERT SPEAKING ON PHONE) How far? Way in. What's it look like? Red. Yeah, it's bright red. I liked her, though. I liked chatting to her when we were at Hindley. She were nice. I'm gonna do dirty things to you, girl. Just you wait and see. Gonna give you a right seeding, too. You dirty. You like it dirty though, don't ya? Yeah. Ah, you a real dirty girl, aren't you? Yeah, I like it dirty, yeah. (KISSING NOISES) (GRUNTING) (CHUCKLING) You give her my love, lad? Eh? - (GRUNTING) - (LAUGHING) I don't mind sharing her with you, Trav. We can go halves, if ya like? Nah. I ain't paying for it. You're some tosser, ain't ya? She could be a right minger. Oh, no, no, she ain't, she can't be. How do you know? You ain't seen the slut. 'Cause she sounds all right. Gonna go and see her when I'm out on probation. Yeah? How'd you know where she's at, then? Ian's doing it for us. Tell you what, lad, she's gonna tell you to fuck off. You wait and see, dick. You think so, do ya? We'll see about that. ALTER EGO: Then we found out she was a nigger-lover. Dirty, dirty girl. ALTER EGO: We felt soiled, eh? (URINATING) So we cleansed our body. Purified ourselves. Got rid of that fucking nigger lurgy she could have passed on to us. Then we stalked her. Followed her. She hadn't a clue. We was on probation. Remember? Then we saw her dirty little half-caste rat! We was sickened. No... We was disgusted! No, I... I'll tell you what I'm gonna fucking do. I'm gonna fucking sort you out and then gonna sort out that fucking kid of yours. Make you wish you never fucking had it. Yeah. Yeah, you fucking cunt. 'Cause I know where you fucking live, don't I? Yeah, I'll tell you what, you're a fucking cunt and so is your fucking kid. Now, fuck off. (PHONE SHUTS) Fucking slut. ALTER EGO: And what was it we said we'd do? (LAUGHING) Oh, yeah! Murder that little half-breed kid of hers. Purge the earth of them all. (LAUGHING) (MEN LAUGHING) (INDISTINCT CONVERSATION) You see that nigger? Fuck him. I should have done him right then. His time will come, lad. Fuck him, and forget about that chat-line slut. (EXHALING) Now, what about our old bird Sara? Oh, yeah, Ian wrote us about her. Mmm... Sara. She was the best sort from down our end. He heard rumors she's been seeing some darkie. We got to sort that, right? Too right. Can't be having none of that now, can we? Tell you what... Let's write a nice, friendly warning letter to our Sara. Make sure she ain't hooking up with no-one... ...inappropriate. (RAP MUSIC PLAYING) What is this shite music? Fucking gangster rap shit, ain't it? We hate it. Right? No, it's good music, man. Listen. I like it. (RAP MUSIC CONTINUES) (MUSIC STOPS) Good. We got rid of him. He is one fucking Paki coward. You know what to write her? Gonna give it to her straight, like. Right. Get this down then, will ya? (SIGHING) Tell her it ain't natural, having relations with anyone who ain't white. We hate 'em spreading their filthy seed into our fuckin' people. Like them niggers down our end. Tell her, we got to protect white women like her. Don't make me come sort you out, girl. (SNICKERING) That's good, lad, eh? That should fuckin' warn her. No messing about. Tell you what, if she don't write us back, we get Ian to sort her out. We tell him to get someone to burn her, eh? Like that time we burned that girl's hair at school. ALTER EGO: Snotty little fuck. Mocking us, weren't she? Like all the other kids at school did. (SCREAMING) (SCREAMING CONTINUES) Serves her right. None of the other kids ever mocked us again, did they? They asked us why we did it. For fun, I said. ALTER EGO: We ain't never gonna let no one make a fool of us ever again. That's what we done, and that's what we'll do. Niggers and Pakis beware, right? (KEYS JINGLING) Stewart? What you doing? Cell inspection, Stewart. Yeah? Bloody guard out to get us now, too. (DOOR CLOSES) Tell you, that Stewart kid's weird. Swear I heard him talking to the wall, but when I walk in... Poof! Nothing. He's just staring at wall, looking all glazed. Oh, yeah? When was this then? When I was doing my rounds. He's nuts. He should be in Broadmoor or something. (SIGHING) Yeah, he ain't all there, that one. But what can we do about it? They want to fill this place with nutters and overwork us then they're asking for trouble. But it's not my problem. Yeah. Yeah, you're right. Filed a report, fuck knows if anyone will take any notice though. Ha, ha. Good luck. We got his file from up north. Some nurse from Hindley had written that he and a mate of his called Maurice weren't safe and could be dangerous. (SNICKERING SARCASTICALLY) Uh... I just think he's a bit of a weirdo. Al least he lightens this place up a bit. No offense, Rahul. (LAUGHING) - Yeah, whatever. - Yeah. Whatever. Have fun, lads. ZAHID: Promise. Cell mate's a bit weird, that's all. You hear? No, don't know. Yeah, he's something anyway. No, no, no, no. It's cool. It's cool. Honestly, he doesn't... He doesn't even bother me. He keeps himself to himself. I do the same thing. It's all right. Yeah, it's fine. Promise. Exactly, exactly. I'll be out, in what, in a few weeks. Yeah. Yeah, I promise, I'm gonna keep myself to myself, I'm gonna get back on track. Yeah. Yeah. Sorry, I let you down, Dad. (LAUGHING) (JEERING) He's a funny guy. What's he think he is? (INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS) (DOOR SLAMMING LOUDLY) They're all after me. Fucking tripping on me. It's full of 'em in here. They keep staring me down. That nigger, you seen him? ANNOUNCER ON RADIO: ...the morning after. Even so, it was a scene unknown in the United Kingdom outside Ulster, since the Blitz... ROBERT: They're all after me, I'm tellin' you. ALTER EGO: Fucking mad arse, they are. Don't they know who we are? We gonna make the ape extinct. Well, what we gonna do? Let me think. Sit the fuck down, will ya? It's the blackies we wanna watch. Pakis ain't shit. We got to sort the niggers first. We are the shining light, the shining knights that are gonna save our kind from these fucking monkeys. Trav would know. He don't know nothing. I want to tell him how it is in here. What? That it's shit? Planet of the fuckin' apes? Yeah, that I've got a Paki pad mate to come back to and niggers keep fucking with me, too. He knew how to sort these mad-arse cunts. Fuck Travis. He can't do nothing. I know what to do. We're gonna keep our heads down for now. Let 'em think we're an easy target. That they've got to us. Then they're gonna come for us. These niggers, they're like a pack of hyenas. They're fucking cowards. We'll lull them in, make them think we're weak. Hmm. Vulnerable. You seen 'em do it before. We seen 'em do it before. Pack mentality. Always preying on the weak. And if they can, they steal and rob while they're at it. So much the better. - (GLASS BREAKING) - (GIRL SCREAMING) (PEOPLE SHOUTING) REPORTER: The police who had taken a low profile for most of the day, appeared again in strength this evening as groups of youths began to gather and the tension began to rise again. - There were some nasty moments... - (SIREN WAILING) - ...but nothing like the concerted confrontation - (CROWD CHANTING) which we witnessed last night. With so many police present in so many places, there was, of course, no opportunity for any brutes to try to seal off the area... Look at them. That's what you get when you let fucking egg and spoons come over here! We ought to send them packing, bunch of fucking... Freeloaders, the lot of 'em. Yeah, I know. But I got to protect myself, that nigger has got it in for me. Here... Look, come here, will ya? Break the crossbar on this table. It'll still stay upright. Don't worry. What if they notice it? Never gonna happen. Them inspections are shite, they walk in and walk out, like that lazy Paki guard. Do it, I'm telling ya... You'll be all right. They ain't never gonna think twice about what we're up to. What you got planned? Gonna fashion ourselves a weapon, lad. Gotta get you some protection, right? When will I do it? Nighttime. Paki be sound asleep. You got light from the toilet lamp. Yeah. Guard's only gonna look through the window wall, couple of times, at most. You got no chance of getting caught. (INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS) And when the nigger least expects it, when him and his mates think they got us running scared... I'll fuck him. Right, lad. Right. Just like when we did that one who tried to stop us taking that car... Remember? (BIRDS CHIRPING) Yeah, that's right. Your turn, man. Right, go on then. Just jimmy it, just like I showed you. Just push it, lad. Come on. No-one's about. Fucking hell! Come on. MAN: Hey, hey what you doing? Get away from that car! - Leave it, you bastards! - Go! What're you doing, huh? Come on then, huh? (SCREAMING IN PAIN) That's how it's done, lad. The nigger won't know what's hit him. Mike, can I have a word? You might want to read this. Stewart's letter to a Maurice Travis at Hindley. Some heavy racism in it. Racism is part and parcel of what we have to put up with, Andrew. You got bloody blacks and Asians mixed with whites, that's what you get. It's hardly anything new now, is it? Just file a report. First, there was the threatening letter to his girl and now this racism stuff. Look, we can't make a special case out of every damn letter, just because there's a bit of racism in it. Now, report it and get it on file. I guess you're right. It's their problem, not ours. Exactly. If you can't serve the time don't do the crime. Now, return it, but don't make a fuss. I don't want to panic the Paki lad in his cell. You know, race isn't a problem in this place. Them lot up above don't give two shits about race relations here so neither do we, right? Sure. Need you in night shift again, Andrew. (INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS) (LAUGHING) What's going on, bro? I can't believe it. Oh, now you're sure it's in that H2O. (INDISTINCT CONVERSATION) (LAUGHING) What's he doing, bruv? Yo! Wanna get buzzin', smoke some weed. Make the time go better. ALTER EGO: You fuckin' jokin'? The only way you're getting' weed in this joint is off a nigger. (MUMBLING) We'd soon as kill a nigger before talkin' to one, right? I like weed. ALTER EGO: You mean you did. Like you liked that monkey music and Bob fuckin' Marley shite. ALTER EGO: Now, come on. Up! We got work to do. Got some fuckin' educatin' to do by the looks of things too, eh? (SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY) What's up, man? You see what I mean? (SCRAPING) It's just so fuckin' shit in here. I wanna blaze. Don't you see 'em? These niggers, high as fuckin' kites? Where's your white pride? Your English pride. It's meant to be a punishment in here. They look like they're havin' the time of their lives. Smoke weed and spread their dirty seed. That's all these jungle bunnies do. Never done a day's work in their lives. We should make 'em all slaves again, right? I know, but weed's good. I love the buzz. Wanna get buzzin', do ya? Fuck the weed. Get a nigger or a Paki and set fire to 'em. We love fires. Could do it now, here, right now, like that time we did with Trav. Nah, not this time. They'd fuckin' do us again. We got better plans now though, don't we? Like when we started fires in school. That was somethin', eh? Reminds me of school in here. ALTER EGO: We fuckin' hated school, didn't we, lad? Everyone was outside with their mums and dads. We were the only ones with no mum and dad there. ALTER EGO: Fuck 'em. We showed 'em. We showed 'em what shunned angry demons we was. I like that, "Shunned angry demons" has a nice ring to it, eh, lad? We almost burnt the school down. Like when we burnt that Paki shop after I did a runner from home. (CHUCKLES) More of that to come. We're gonna nail bomb some Pakis. Blast 'em, burn 'em all. Fuckin' Bradford. Southall. Fuckin' sick that'll be! But first we got to protect ourselves in here. Keep safe. Then we'll show 'em what we're made of. Did I get this or did you? We both got it. It was when we became a warrior. A white warrior. When we became a man. Celtic fuckin' cross, mate. You done that, when you were a skinhead, a wannabe Jamaican rude boy. Cunts. Disgrace to white pride, that is. You should laser it off. Yeah. Me and Trav were skinheads. Skinheads love Marley. That Rasta nigger bullshit. Fuckin' Travis. He got you into that shite. But then we got you on the right track. Not that nigger-loving crap. You ain't a skinhead, not no more. They're weak. You are a fucking white knight, a defender of English pride. Fuckin' skinheads. "Working-class lads are working-class lads," they said. Bullshit. England is for white working-class lads. And we ain't taking on any more of that fuckin' black culture, not no more. Now, let that shit on your arm be a lesson to ya. And this... This says fuck off to anyone who ain't white. (LAUGHING) (SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY) (CONTINUES LAUGHING) Wish Trav were here now. We'd sort them all out. Me and Trav ruled the fuckin' roost. ALTER EGO: No, we ruled the roost, lad. We did. You think them days were glory days, do ya? Well, wait for the days that're nearly upon us. Then you'll see glory. He thought he was leadin' us, but he weren't, we were guidin' him. And don't you ever forget that! TRAVIS: I bet I can ruin twice as many Pakis as you in half the time. Love to see that, not a chance, not if I get me a weapon. Ah, you got lots to learn, lad! I don't need a weapon. I'm the most dangerous fucker in here, no one messes with me. ROBERT: That's it, Trav, go on! (TRAVIS LAUGHS) TRAVIS: I fuckin' love someone to try it in here, I'd fuckin' cut 'em with a razor. Fuckin' stomp on their heads so hard their fuckin' eyes pop out. ROBERT: Go on, Trav, fuckin' tell 'em! TRAVIS: Fuckin', yeah! What're you gonna do lad, eh? What're you gonna do? Fuckin, come on! Aargh! (LAUGHS MANIACALLY) Fuckin' have it! ROBERT: I'll pop their eyes out too, but I'll use a blunt fuckin' razor. So, you'd have to fuckin' saw and saw and saw. And after, if a Paki squares up to me, I'll tell him his arms are too short to box with God. TRAVIS: (LAUGHING) Yeah, that's it lad. Fuckin' go on! Pakis, beware! You wanna burn that nigger cunt? Or you wanna cut him? Get you a blunt blade. So you have to fuckin' saw his fuckin' neck. - (DOOR OPENS) - Yeah, you fuck! - Nice. - (DOOR CLOSES) I miss Trav. Fuckin' Trav. We were like family. It were great when we was neighbors. That's what I want. I know. But that time's passed. We fucked 'em though, didn't we? Did a lot of damage. Remember them cells at Hindley, don't ya? Yeah. 'Course I do. I can see it like it were yesterday. ROBERT: Trav? You got something? Tell me. TRAVIS: I tell you what we fuckin' do, lad. I'll tell ya. ROBERT: What? What? Tell me. (TRAVIS GRUNTING ANGRILY) What do you get when you put two fuckin' hoods in adjoining cells, lad, eh? ROBERT: I don't know, Trav. What do you get? TRAVIS: Fuckin' chaos. The jokers who run these joints ain't got a clue, have they? Over and over, us and Trav put in the same joint. Time and again we shared cells where we was neighbors. Fuckin' morons deserved the chaos we caused. ROBERT: Ahh! Fuckin', yeah! (INDISTINCT SHOUTING) ROBERT: Fuckin', come on! Fuck, yeah, have some of that! Fuckin' have it! Fuckin'! (BOTH PANTING) TRAVIS: What're you doin', lad, eh? (PANTING) You gone to sleep? You gotta fuckin' man up, man, 'cause you wanna cause the kinda damage I cause! ROBERT: No, mate. Why don't we really show 'em what we can do, eh? TRAVIS: What've you got for me, lad, eh? ROBERT: I'm gonna give 'em more than your fucking chaos. I'm gonna give 'em a blazin' fuckin' holocaust! I'm making myself a fire. Fuckin' great, weren't it? Muppets had zero supervision. I don't even think they knew us and Trav were mates. We're gonna do better though. Don't worry. Trust me. Because we're more dangerous than Trav. You remember Averill, don't you? We made Trav do it. We got him to bleed the cunt! Now, that is power! 'Cause it was always us. We let him think he was in control. And we're gonna do it again. We're gonna bleed someone. Fuckin' white pussy's got issues, man. GUARD: Oi! Knock it off! - Derrick! - DERRICK: What? Pack it in. Next time. Fuckin' white boy! (KEYS JINGLING) (UNLOCKING) But that's just it, they don't know everythin' about us. They crush us and vilify us, but our probation officer was the one who didn't think we were worth monitorin'. I were different with him, though. We're different on the outside. Being banged up does crazy things to your mind. Or you sayin' we was bein' manipulative? You can't manipulate a probation officer, can ya? (CHUCKLES) They crucify us and then don't have any way of rehabilitatin' you. Fuck that. I'll be the one doin' the rehabilitatin' from here on in. You're spot on, mate. I know I am. Mubarek's requested he be moved from cell 38. Why is that then, Zahid? Stewart, sir. It's just getting too much now. He freaks me out, can't take it. The other day, I woke up, and he's just sitting there lookin' at me, just starin'. It's not the first time either. Just not right, something's just nasty about him. Has he threatened you in any way? No. It's just the way he looks. - It's like... - Has he behaved aggressively towards you? No, not physically... Physically assaulted you and he hasn't threatened you? No. So what, he just looks at you funny? Has he even spoken to you at all? No, that's what I'm trying to say, we haven't even had a proper conversation. He's just weird. The other day I could've sworn I heard him talking to the wall, I didn't catch him at it, though, but... And you suspect something similar as well? I've walked in on him facing the wall like he's been staring at it for God knows how long. I'm not sure if I've seen him actually talking to walls, but he is definitely weird, yeah. ZAHID: He scares me, guv. I don't like it, it's just weird. To be honest, I don't think he even wants to be in the same cell as me. So he's a weirdo who maybe talks to walls or to himself. Hmm. Look, If he's done nothing threatening, I can't move you. Besides I've got nowhere else to put you. Look, you're out in a few days, Zahid, so keep your head down and ignore him. How am I supposed to ignore him though, guv, the cell's so small... Go on now, on your way, son. We're almost at the breaking point, I've got to deal with a whining Paki. ROBERT: That was a fuckin' wicked film. Hando is a fuckin' Nazi God. Romper fucking Stomper. (URINATING) ALTER EGO: We gotta spread the word. That's what we're gonna be. We need to tell everyone. We gotta tell Trav about it, he needs to watch that. Write him a letter. Tell him Romper Stomper is a fat film. Tell him we are gonna be like Hando. Them niggers. Kill 'em all. Like 'em blokes who had killed Stephen Lawrence... I wish they was in here now. I would shut those niggers up. I'm fed up with talk. What are we gonna do about it? You're gonna be a hero. We're gonna be heroes. One fucking nigger at a time. I want back to Hindley. See Trav. If you want back to Hindley then I'll get you back to Hindley. But we don't need Trav. Look at that letter you wrote him, telling him what we're gonna be when we're out. Trav's gonna be so jealous. We don't need no one. We're like the fuckin' KKK of Feltham. Wait... (SNIFFING) Someone's comin'. Free man tomorrow... Free man. I can't believe it, man, I owe my parents big time though, man. That's why I gotta keep my head down and sort things out, man. Trust me. (CONTINUES INDISTINCTLY) INMATE: Reckon you'll be joining up the army then? You know what? I might try, man. I enjoyed all that stuff with the Prince's Trust, do you remember that? Yeah. Would you? Nah man, Not for me. (LAUGHS) Not for you? No. (INDISTINCT CONVERSATION) Make sure you hit me up. - I will, man. - When I'm out, yeah? - I will, I will, I will. - Make sure you do. Left you this magazine, if you want. - No? - (DOOR OPENS) - Whatever. - (DOOR CLOSES) Fuck! (EXHALES) It ain't right, is it? They ain't gonna give us bail and he gets out tomorrow! Don't seem fair, does it, lad? Paki walks free and we can't even make bail. I never thought I'd see the day that a Paki gets treated better than a white man. A son of this land. Let's give 'em something to think about. We'll write 'em another letter. A warning letter. We'll let 'em have this one straight off. Let 'em know what'll happen if we don't make bail. I'll give them guards something to shit 'em up. And then I wanna see the weapon. Those niggers are gonna get a fright. (DOOR OPENS) (DOOR CLOSES) Right, come on then, Paki's out the way, let's have a look. Ooh. It's looking grand, ain't it, mate? Grand. (EXHALES) Those niggers won't know what's hit 'em. (KNOCKING ON DOOR) (KEYS JINGLING) (DOOR OPENS) I can hear him comin'. (DOOR CLOSES) He might find it. I'll have to batter him. ALTER EGO: He ain't gonna find it. At least, he better not find it. If he does, you'll be on your own, I can't help ya. Now, pop it underneath the mattress, between the bars at the end of the bed like I told ya. He'll only check under mattress, like, if he even checks. Besides, he's a lazy Paki guard, this one. Just like our pad mate. Thought he was out to get us, but he ain't paid enough to give a shit. Like all of 'em. Fuckin' useless. Paid too little and work too long. Still, serves him right for bein' a Paki though, eh? (DOOR CLOSES) (KEYS JINGLING) Cell inspection. See! No problem. Easy fuckin' peasy. No, I promised I'm gonna keep my head down this time. Honestly. Yeah. Sorry, I let you down, yeah. ALTER EGO: If we don't get bail, we'll take extreme measures. We'll get shipped out. We'll kill our fuckin' pad mate if we have to. How's Mum? (FOOTSTEPS) We'll bleach our sheets and pillow case white and make a... "Ku Klux Klan crucifix." So? It's all talk, Andrew. Like I said, just a bit of harmless banter. Shouldn't be so sensitive about every sentence and paragraph. We're hardly the center of cultural fuckin' relations, are we? Yeah, I guess you're right. Just make a report on his file. Besides, I'm too tired to give a shit. Okay, will do. ALTER EGO: The screws here don't know us like those at Hindley did. We'll change the cross on our head to a swastika. That'll fuckin' show 'em. - (INDISTINCT CONVERSATION) - (LAUGHING) Whatever, man. I'll give him a show. What's wrong with you? (EXCLAIMS) (INDISTINCT CONVERSATION) (LAUGHING) Move on, you two. Now. Cell inspection is done. Fuckin' tired. Anything to report, anything confiscated? Nothing major, no. Some broken furniture was all. One lad snuck some food in, but I binned it. They wanna break stuff, it's their problem. On duty tonight, Rahul. With Nigel. (RADIO STATIC) (SIGHS) DOCTOR: That's fine, Robert. Just fine. Mrs. Stewart. Have there been any improvements in the physical relationship between you? I have been trying. It's just it's still so difficult. I just... I don't... At least you're trying, Mrs. Stewart. Look at you. Look at me. Sat there crying looking at a school photo. (SOBBING) Ugly. Ugly. Ugly. Ugly. Ugly. Ugly. Ugly. Ugly. Ugly. Ugly. Ugly. Ugly. Pathetic! Weak! But we ain't weak no more. And you, lad... You were right! We are ugly. (PANTING) (ALARM BLARING) (WRITING) (SIGHS)
