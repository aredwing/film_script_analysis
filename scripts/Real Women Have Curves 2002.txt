Come on, hurry up. Congratulations! CONGRATULATIONS ANA Thank you, cousins. All the happiness, Ana... Grandpa... ...for many years. Look at your big cake. Cake? Oh, my God. Can't you see she's bigger than the cake? I want some. A big one. Ana, who is it? Good afternoon, sir. Ma'am. I'm Luis Guzman. I'm Ana's English teacher. Let's go, Anita. She doesn't do her chores... she doesn't clean her room, she doesn't do laundry... she doesn't cook... She gives me plenty of trouble. Carmencita. Ana doesn't give you that much trouble. Look, her teacher... is very happy with her. If we make an effort... I believe we can help her get into college, to get an education. I can teach her. I can teach her to sew. I can teach her to raise her kids... and take care of her husband. Those are things they won't teach her in school. It's all right, she can get married later. Are you not listening to me? It's a matter of principle. It's not fair. I worked since I was 13 years old... and Ana is 18 years old. Now it's her turn. She has to work. Oh, my God. Don't even think about it. Look at you! Enormous! You're so dramatic. - Good morning, Mrs. Carmen. - Good morning! Good morning, Normita. Good morning, Panchita. Mrs. Carmen, how are you? Very well, thank you. Yeah? It's beautiful. Envy or charity? Like my grandmother used to say, "There's no better dressing... "than meat on bones." Mommy, she's Mrs. Carmen's daughter. Welcome, I hope you like the job. Yes, my general. Did you hear, Mrs. Carlota? We're close to 100. What a beautiful dress. I don't think she'll make it, and with her mother here... She's so arrogant. Mommy, Mrs. Carmen has gossip. I love gossip. That's horrible. That dirty old man... Iooks like a shriveled-up mango. El Dorado Ortiz is in love with Rosali. Yes, my general. Where are you going? You little brat. Wait! Come here! Don't make me come after you! Yeah, this fatty. Where are you going? Where the hell are you going? I can't take it anymore. I'm too old for this. I don't know why I'm working. My hands have arthritis. And I'm going blind from so much sewing. What? Am I embarrassing you? Are you ashamed to work with us? Oh, my God. You have to help me. Come on. You behave, okay? How cute! Look at yourself in the mirror. - Good morning. - Good morning, Gorgonia. - How did you sleep? - Okay, and you? How do you think, with my arthritis? That one... They're delicious. That's how I like them. You're a treasure. Grandpa... Do you remember our gold... close to our hometown, near the hills? There was a cave full of gold. Papa, those are only legends. And the men who saw the cave and the gold? The gold doesn't exist, Dad. Grandpa, tell me about the treasure. Many years ago, during the Revolution... people would hide their gold in the caves in the mountains. After the Revolution, there was a rumor... that there was a cave full of gold... close to our hometown. Inside the cave... there was a sign painted on the wall, that said: "This gold can only be taken by a man with a pure heart." I always wanted to find that gold. Grandpa, I'm sure you're going to find it. Look, I already found it. You are my gold. Now I want you to find yours. It's finished. With that music, they want to get on TV. They need to improve a little bit. Yeah, I'd say. Estela, Ana, you really missed something in the soap opera The Poor Cry More. - They're better. Isn't that so? - Much better. Well... to her mother who was crying there. And it cut her head off! Get water, the burner's here. Look. What do you think? I say this from the heart. Tell me. What? I'm sorry. Good luck. Mrs. Carmen... thank you for everything. God bless you. And you, Mrs. Carmen? And you say I don't love you. And you, girl? You little brat! You burned yourself, dear! "Heal, heal, little frog tail. "If it doesn't heal now, it will heal tomorrow." Fatty, wake up. Ladies... Come. God damn him. She's worse than you said. Did you say something, Estela? Your mother is waiting for you, dear. Your mother is a little crazy. She's asking for her little girl. Who knows what she might want? - Hi. - Hi. Shut the door. - Are you ready to leave? - I'm coming, Grandpa! Let's go. - And where are you two going? - Ana invited me to the movies tonight. I think it's a great idea. - Don't wait up for us. - Have fun. Thank you, good night. We'll meet here in two hours. Be good. Okay. Come on, hurry up. Hi. Hi. Let's go, guys. Good evening. Thank you, darling. - Whose turn is it? - Mine. Here's my piece. It's that man who's always looking for Ana. Okay, let me see. - Good afternoon. - Good afternoon. - Come in. - Thanks. Please. It's okay, Carmencita. Don't put chilies on the nopalitos. I'll get an upset stomach. Then don't eat them. Listen... What a beauty. Why didn't you value yourself? That means "the change of life." Damn! He who smells it first is the one who has it beneath him. Put it on. And you? Hail Mary! What are you trying to do? That's nothing. Have you all gone mad? And how good this feels! You have no shame. You're welcome, dear. Sit down, please. Ana has something to tell you. I'm leaving, Dad. Have a nice day. Let's go, sweetie. Let's go, you'll miss the plane. Good luck, cousin. Write from New York. We'll visit you. Don't worry about me. You'll always be in my heart. Take care, sweetie. 1, 2, 3, go! - What? - Go! "1, 2, 3, go!" - Start! - I already said it! I already said, "1, 2, 3, go!" - Yes, but sing a song now! - Which one? - O Sole Mio. - Again? Don't you get tired of it? SOFTITLER
