I know it ain't The Garden, but we've got a packed house. - He's ready, right? - I'm ready. Who's up, The Brother? No, it's The Brother's brother-- The Brute, Luca. - Just give us a good show, man. - Hey, I only know one way to fight. Yeah, that's why you're still in this piece-of-shit rathole. - Let's go. - Come on. All right, this is your fight, Ringo, okay? This is all you, big guy. You win this, we get 500, all right? - How's the left arm? It's good? - Good good. - You got this-- - Fuck off. Yeah, let's go, baby! You the man, Luca. You the man. Do it! Don't worry about this guy, all right? Second fighters out. Bring it in. I want a good clean fight. All right, let's fight! Come on, Ringo. That's art you're watching, all right? That's art. Look at this guy. He's dancing, okay? That's like-- that's like dancing. - Boo! - Come on, you gonna fight or what? - That's what I'm doing. - That's not fighting! Come on, beat the shit out of each other before this crowd kills us. - Yeah! - Come on, get him! Yeah! Yeah! - What's wrong? - He got a-- Come on! Yeah! Come on! Fuck. Come on! Now when you step into that cage, the first rule of fighting is don't get hit. If you break that rule, then there's another one which is you're gonna hurt no matter what. Gonna hurt like hell. Gonna hurt like hell. Gonna hurt like hell. Now when you step into that cage, the first rule of fighting is don't get hit. Now I told you, don't-- don't-- don't get hit. You're gonna get hurt. The king in his cage. Get out of there alive. Now when you step into that cage, it's gonna hurt like hell. Don't get hit. It's gonna hurt like hell. If you break that rule, it's gonna hurt like hell. Live to win. It's gonna hurt like hell. Ringo? Yeah. You okay? Yeah. I'm great. I'll be out in a sec. I didn't see it. Big Freddy didn't see it. Luca's an asshole and a cheat. I don't know which one's worse. That's okay, Link. You win some, you lose most. Here's your cut. Really? Thanks, Ringo. It's this one, right? - Yes. - Ringo. - Hey, Pepper. - Who's my favorite? How you doing? You're looking great. - Hey, Link. - Hi, Pepper. Hey, do you think you could help me do this up? Is anybody gonna help with the goddamn beer? Let me help you with that, Kara. What the hell happened to your face? Nothing. Face is fine. That kid's not supposed to be back here. Oh, he's a darling. And you're late. I gotta go. Ringo needs me and I help him so... Okay. - Yeah. - Thank you. - I'm gonna go. - Okay. Bye, Link. Oh my God, she's so cute and naked all the time. - She's just so naked. - You know you don't work here, right? I got it. I'll just hang out with you. No. Go home. Yeah, I mean I should go. Good fight tonight, Ringo. That was a good fight? - You're still walking. - You're right. - Jesus Christ, you're a mess, Ringo. - Yeah, ain't that the truth? All right, we're slammed. Let's go. You better slow down or else you're gonna get those guys drunk. Stop trying to be charming and get me my ice, Duran. Hey, I stopped being charming for weeks now. It wasn't doing me any good. You know, soon enough I'm gonna start thinking you're not interested. I'm not. So you never told me what happened to your face. Well, the guy went left, I went right. - You know how it goes. - What happened when you went right? I blocked his punch with my face. What are you doing when you're not fighting or getting me ice anyway? - Sleep. - Yeah? Alone? Kara, you know, can I take five? Yeah, sure. Just bring me back a couple boxes of ice. Sure, no problem. - Yo, give me a beer. - Not you again. - Hey, I made 20 bucks tonight. - Link. Ringo, where you going? Hey, Mr. Ponzo, I didn't see you come in. Well, I saw you. I saw you sneaking away like a little dog. What, all you guys are alike? Look, Sergio, why don't you go to the VIP? I'll send you a bottle and we can talk things-- I didn't come here to talk. I didn't come to look at the girls. You know why I'm here. It's time for you to give me back my money. Relax. All right. - What the fuck is this? - It's all I got. Are you kidding me? It's all you got? There's a huge disparity between all you got and what you owe. - That's the story of my life. - You don't get it, do you? This is an insult. You owe me-- Razer. Ringo, I got a business to run, all right? I got a reputation to uphold and if I allow one person to be one day late, my whole system could fail. Now you owe me $20,000 and I want it now. Six years of self-defense and three bad boyfriends. Try me, asshole. Ringo, the girls here fight better than you. Yeah, you don't need to tell me that. - Should I call the police? - Heh, the police? Sugar-britches, we own the police. - We gonna have a problem? - No, we don't have a problem. Ringo is the one with the problem-- Now I'm gonna give you till the end of the month and that's only 'cause I like you. I wanna see you still breathing. Jeez, did your cut open? I don't know. I can't feel anything. Who's looking after the bar? The boys in the front can handle it. - Just hold still. - You've done this before? Two brothers who always fought and... an unused degree in nursing. - You didn't want to become a nurse? - I liked the hours. I-- I didn't like the suffering. So I work at a strip club instead. That tray to the throat-- that was pretty good. Yeah, I got game. So you gonna tell me what that was all about? That was Sergio and his bodyguard Razer. And what does he do? Sergio's a businessman. There was a time when I used to gamble and it was his business to collect after I lost. So why'd you keep losing? I kept on betting on myself to win. Well, that wasn't so smart, now was it? - Take the night off. - You sure? Yeah, I got it here. No worries. Thanks. I'll be here. - So? - You'd be a lot more impressive if you could use that left once in a while. - Just hold the bag, okay? - All right. What is this? The Spanish show pony or the donkey's ass? - What the hell's he doing here? - I don't know. - I hope he's not here to-- - I'm here to train, fellas. - Get ready for school. - Now, Alonso, you know your-- - Where was he staying? - Upper West Side. Upper West Side money's not good in this gym. Yeah? That's not what your ex-wife said. Well, she got what she deserved, which was you. Hold the bag. Come on. So how's the left arm there, Ringo? - Left arm is fine. - Oh, really? Hey, man, this is a training gym, okay? This ain't a fucking schoolyard. Who the fuck is this? The new girlfriend? Who the hell are you calling girlfriend? Hey hey hey, relax, man. What the hell's going on? Do not disrespect my gym. You two guys wanna fight, there's the ring. Relax, man. It's just training. See? That's the difference between you and me. Every fight's a title fight. Watch it, Ringo. Focus your punches, Alonso. Target's right in front of you. Focus your punches, focus your punches. Come on, Ringo. Attaboy. There you go. Get your range, get your range. - Oh, man. - It's on his arm. I know. All right, everybody, let's get back to work here. Training's over, old man. And there ain't nothing wrong with my focus. All right, whatever. You just let anybody into the gym? The thing about Alonso's money is it's much better than anybody else's because he's actually got some. Well, he's an animal. Well, why don't you give him a run then? Show him his place. Tonight on "Torko" we cover the Maximum Cage Warrior League direct from New York. Now joining us in studio is the league's commissioner, Brian Waite, alongside the undisputed, undefeated champion of the world, Christopher "The Pressure" Holland. - You make that sound so nice. - Okay. Pressure Holland-- now there's a real killer submission hold master. Try to listen to this. Brought Christopher along to make the announcement. Now Pressure here put this organization on the map and he is our brightest, most brutally talented fighter. - Isn't that right, Pressure? - Please don't stop. No, I'm just kidding. But... - What a cool guy. - Don't let him fool you. So you're looking to discover the undiscovered. That's right. Today we're accepting applications for the most incredible elite competition to find the greatest undiscovered fighter in the world. Our finalist will go up against a pro for the title and an MCW contract-- that is if anyone thinks they have what it takes. Now correct me if I'm wrong, but that pro would be yourself, Christopher. - Well, yeah. - He's the best of the best over here. - You kidding me? - And I am the best, you know. - And I will remain that way. - There you have it. That's why Alonso's back. Alonso's trying to go pro? Yeah. Know anybody else who might be interested? No? Thought not. Okay, let's go. No rest for the wicked. Don't waste time in here. Sometimes a fighter brings his own fight. Other times you gotta bring that fight to the fighters. When two wild animals are locked up in a cage together, sometimes that could make a fighter more hungry. Don't tell Ringo I snuck in again, okay? My lips are sealed, but only for a little while, sugar. Do you believe in-- dest-- do you believe in destiny? Yeah, I mean she's a great girl. Yeah, she is. No no, but I mean like fate. I know, pumpkin. I was just making a funny. Look, listen, do you think unless sometimes people are pushed they'll never reach their full potential? Well, I think that you're reaching your full potential right now without doing any pushing. No, seriously. Come to the edge. But we might fall. Come to the edge. But it's too high! COME TO THE EDGE! And they came, and he pushed, and they flew. Poet Christopher Logue. - Who are you? - My real name's Gwendolyn. Gwendolyn. Does this club have a computer hooked up to the Internet? - What are you doing? - One second. Work work work. Come on. Done. Thank you. I just might have saved my best friend's life. Aw, you are so sweet. And you might just be stealing my heart right from my chest. You shouldn't be out so late, Ringo. Your boss said I had a month. I'm off the clock. See... I didn't like how we ended the night last night. What? With you being beat up by a girl? Drop it! Drop the knife! You see, Razer, you brought a knife to a bottle fight. Now your boss said I had a month. I suggest you let me have it, okay? Now go to a hospital. You're gonna need stitches in that. What? I'm trying to teach you to be a fighter, not a goon. Go! Hey! - What happened? Are you hurt? - Always. You're bleeding. I don't think this is mine. Jesus, you leave my sight for 10 minutes... - Let's get you to a hospital. - Not a good idea. I just sent the other guy there. Well, you can't lay here bleeding in a strip club parking lot. You'll give this establishment a bad name. Let's go. Whoa whoa. Okay. There's a light here. Are you good? Yeah, I'm good. There used to be a couch there. So what got you into fighting in the first place? - It's been in the family. - Yeah? Your dad? - No, my mom. - Really? She was a fighter. She was a good fighter. You know, I'd think a mother wouldn't want to see her son get beat up so much. She never did. She died shortly after the picture was taken. Sorry. That's okay, she didn't mean to. So why do you love it so much-- fighting? Fighting? Simple. I don't have to worry about any of this. You know, for those few minutes in the cage... I feel like I belong in this world. I may go down 100 times, but I am determined to get up 101 times. And when I'm getting up, just in that second, I'm happy, fearless. Just in that second I feel like a winner, you know. What's with the arm? Nothing. Arm is fine. Bullshit. I've watched you for a month lift almost everything with one hand. What gives? Does this hurt? High pain tolerance, huh? - What are you doing? - Nothing. Son of a g-- Dislocated? How did-- how did you know-- It's called a subluxation. It's a partial dislocation. It's hard to tell. Don't worry, it'll-- it'll heal. Wow. Is there anything you don't know? Watch out, the arm. Take the pain, Rocky. I think I'm gonna need your help with the shirt. - You're trying to kill me. - Sorry. Sorry about your other arm. That was the good one. That's the bad one. - Does that hurt? - Yeah. - Okay, 'cause I can go. - No! - No, I can stop. - No no no no. - I kind of had plans anyway. - I was just playing. I was playing. How the hell did he end up in there? - That's Ringo Duran. - Yeah, I know who it is. How'd he pass our screening? His mother's in the Hall of Fame, Christopher. Look, the guy's a bum. He's a loser. And everybody knows he has a gimpy arm and nothing left in the tank. Yeah, but he's got heart. The crowd loves heart. The crowd will love what we decide they love. Right? Well, the last time I checked, Christopher, the letters CEO were after my name outside that door. Well, let me tell you something, Billy Bad-ass. I'm the one who put this organization on the map, okay? Well, contractually I'm obligated to say that on national television, but not here in this boardroom. Come on, Pressure, we could do worse than Ringo Duran. Look, let's just-- let's see what we've got there. How about this guy? I seen him in the Pro-Am in California. Alonso Scott? He's good. Wild, but dangerous. - Yeah, he's got a bad attitude. - He's got a bad attitude? This is Maximum Cage Warriors. Everybody has a bad attitude. Hey hey hey, what are you doing? I'm annihilating this heavy bag with my fists of steel. Your fists of steel? Let me give you some advice, okay? For some fighters it's all about volume, especially if you're young like you. So my advice for you is you go on numbers. Something like this. - Right? - Well, what about you? For me it's best to sit back, take in the flow of the fight, look for an opening or create an opening. And when I got it... I take it. One shot might be all I get. Wait, was that your left arm? What the hell happened to you last night? Yeah, I was about to ask you the same question. All right, we are here to announce our selection for the MCW and we've certainly gotta tell you we found some undiscovered gems. Absolutely, we have found four of the greatest amateur fighters... Come on, say my name already. Well, Pressure, since you put this organization on the map, why don't you start us off? Our first selection is one of the most lethal fighters out there-- Landon "The Brother" Popoff. - They must have disqualified Luca. - Asshole. Straight out of San Francisco, the original back alley brawler, Seville "Fingers" Duarte. Yeah, I told you. And I'm very proud to announce our next selection-- New Jersey's very own Alonso Scott. - Yeah! - That's right. You heard him. And last but certainly not least-- never have we seen a more true underdog with real pedigree. Ringo Duran. - Yes! - What? Hey, you finally came to your senses. - It must be a mistake. - I don't think-- You're damn right it's a mistake. Nobody would let a sad sack of shit like you in there. Okay, Alonso, let's go. This bum don't need to be in the same ring as me. Let's get back to work, please. Let's everybody. Someone get the TV. Let's go, let's go. Beautiful. I never applied for the tournament. - You didn't? - No. Then who did? What? What were you thinking? I thought that maybe this would be good for you. How could this possibly be good for me? You're the best fighter they named today. Why, man? Why would you enter without asking me? Because... you need to go to the edge. - What? - Yeah, you need to go to the edge. Look, Ringo... Okay, look, you need to go to the edge, okay? I mean, look look, we might fall. Go to the edge. It's-- it's too high. Go to the edge, okay? And you came, and I pushed, and you flew. Poet Christopher Logue. - Are you high right now? - What? No. Listen, Ringo, sometimes a man-- he needs to be pushed over the edge to find out his true destiny. Did you sleep with that girl yesterday night? - No, l-- - Tell me you slept with the girl. Tell me you fell in love with her so I don't beat the shit out of you right now, okay? No. Yes, l... Look, I might have seen Gwendolyn for a bit last night. - Who? - Gwendolyn-- Pepper. It's Pepper. - Pepper. - Yeah. And she teach you this, right? I might have picked it up from her. Well, stop learning poetry from strippers. Nothing good can come out of that, okay? Break it up, guys. Let's go. We're waiting for you. - You want me to train with him? - Yes, I do. I got two fighters on the biggest amateur ticket of the decade. I want one of you to survive. Come on, let's go. What's the matter? Ringo, one-time offer right now. Do you want me as your corner guy or not? - Yes yes, he does, Raphael. - Does he? He does. Tell him how much the top prize is. $100,000. $100,000? That's a lot of money. So what's it gonna be? Are you here for the workout, just to shed a few pounds, or do you want me to train you up for the biggest challenge you're ever gonna face against the best opposition on the world's biggest stage? - Well, if you put it that way... - All right. Well, then you're gonna have to trust me to do the best thing. Let's go. Hey, you're a daisy if you do. - What the hell does that mean? - I'm not sure. Did he call you a daisy? Look, let's just put Ringo Duran with Alonso Scott and let them at each other's throat. No no, we need a story to tell. Ringo and Alonso is the match-up. They're from the same gym, they both fought in the same backroom cages. So that's what we'll go with. No, this is the ticket. We need to build towards it like a perfect storm. We need to... Look at this. Landon Popoff. Ringo and Landon's brother fought at Breaks Shoe Shop. It was a goddamn mess. We put Landon in the cage to avenge his brother being blacklisted. We call it-- I don't know-- Redemption. Ringo wins, Alonso advances. We have the perfect clash of the titans. Look, there's a lot of ifs. Hell, if if was a fifth, we'd all be drunk. If Alonso and Ringo don't fight, we blow our blockbuster. And that's the bigger question. Can your guy advance past The Brother? Are you worried about defending your title against Ringo? I'm The Pressure. I don't worry about nobody; people worry about me. You know what I'm saying? Here's what we're gonna do. We're gonna do Landon versus Ringo. That is a great idea that you just had. You're damn right it's a great idea. Marcy, get that down, please. Yeah, Marcy, put that down. And can you quote him? Just "The Pressure"? - You got jokes, huh? - 'Cause "The Pressure" says it's true. Hey, you better pump your brakes, baby. Just saying. Just pump the brakes. That's all I'm saying. You okay with that? He's dirtier than his brother. Yeah, you just make sure he doesn't have a crowbar down his pants. Ringo, let's go. Gotta hit the weights. Get up. - He said only boxing, man. - This is fighting, not horseshoes. Okay, Alonso, Alonso. Okay okay okay okay, that's enough. The hell it's enough. You're both weak. You think this guy's your ticket? Then you are delusional. Two broken down old men with no titles and no balls. Hey, you can disrespect me, but don't disrespect Raphael, okay? Why? Because he coached some bitch to a championship back in the Stone Ages? Her name was Gracie Duran. And for your information, it was actually five world championships in three different disciplines, and she had more talent in one painted little pinky finger than you have in your 205 lbs. Whatever, man. Whatever. Take your gloves off and leave the gym. You're gonna choose him over me? There's no choice to be made here. You already made it for me. - We'll settle this in the cage then. - Looking forward to it! Sorry, Raphael. Nothing to be sorry for. You think I wanted to train that piece of shit? Fucking lowlife. He has no respect. He does not respect even the canvas that we walk on. The only reason I kept him around after the announcements were made was to make you better. My money's on you. Maybe we'll call it a day, eh? You took a lot of punishment. No, let's keep on training. Let's go. Hey, I need a new sparring partner. Get your shit together. Let's go. It's me. I'm here. - Where are you? - In the tub. - Having a little soak? - Yeah. And how is your shoulder feeling? - It's feeling. - Good. So your day was good? - Interesting. - Really? Mm-hmm. Well, it's about to get a little more interesting. May l? Well? - I'm thinking. - Screw you. Raphael dropped Alonso today, kicked him out of the gym. I thought Alonso was supposed to be the Second Coming. So did l. But it seems Raphael wants to back me. Well, he's a wise man. I have an idea. I'm thinking after the tournament's over, we should get out of here. It would be nice. A restart. Come here. Ringo Duran. You must be a very wealthy man if you can afford to eat in this restaurant and pay me back the money you owe me. - Well, I'm neither. - Then you're in purgatory. Let me drink to your lost soul. - Where's the goon? - Razer? I'm not so sure about Razer anymore. Very hard to get good help these days, even with the economy the way it is. I would like to propose something. - What's this? - The next fight. You're fighting in the MCW? And what does this have to do with me and the $20,000 you owe me? Top prize is $100,000. Okay. If I win, 50% of that is yours. How about if you win I keep it all, and I decide then and there how much you get? If you kill me now, you get nothing but a dry-cleaning bill to get my blood out of your nice white suit. - What are you, a 10:1, 15:1? - 25:1. Ringo, those are some odds. That's some spread. One can make a lot of money on those odds. - You can say that again. - I'll think about it. When will I know? You'll know when you don't wake up with a bullet in your head. The guy doesn't have a goddamn chance in hell. Hey, it's me. What do you mean "Me who?" you mother-cocksucker? It's Sergio. You know that favor you owe me? Looks like it's gonna be quite a show. Nice. It's not that nice. It's pretty nice. Okay, it's pretty nice. This beats The Breaks. - Hey, Coach. - What time do you call this? - How's your arm? - Raphael. - Yeah? - I want to introduce you to... - my friend Kara. - Girlfriend. Does this guy know this? He does now. Yeah. - Ringo's told me a lot about you. - Has he? Well, he's told me jackshit about you, sweetheart. Probably because he's afraid I just might steal you away. She's blushing. I like that. Come here. Boy, a long time since I seen the insides of a venue like this. - Hopefully it won't be the last time. - Yeah, hopefully. But we gotta get by Popoff first, don't we? Or nothing. Now Popoff, he's a-- he's a cheating bastard, but me and Link, we got you covered. It's more than that. I need you to do something for me in that ring tonight, Ringo. - I want you to change up your style. - What? Look, you're a graceful fighter. That's why I love you. I know that anything he throws at you you can probably slip or you can block, sidestep, but the problem is everyone knows your-- knows your game. Popoff knows your game, I know your game, everybody knows your game. The crowd does not. Now if you're gonna try and dance your way through the first couple of rounds and avoid punches and not throw too much back, it's gonna piss everybody off out there. And in a building like this, if you lose the crowd-- - You lose the fight. - Exactly. There's the guy now. So this is what I want you to do. When that bell rings, I want you to come out of that corner relentless. Just think about it, okay? - Do that for me, will you? - Okay. - Raphael. - I saw him. Can you get the door? Just lock it up in here now. All right? Think about what I'm telling you, okay? Okay, let's go. Let's get ready. - Hey, Landon, I want you to win. - You want me to do what? You'd like me to do what, Mr. Holland? I want you to win. Of course, man. It's me, the Popoff. - It's Ringo. I'm gonna own him. - You're gonna own him? Okay. I know your style and I like your style. Matter of fact, the MCW needs more fighters like you. - A good bad guy's hard to find. - Cool. And because I like your style, the referee might not be able to see everything that happens in the ring today. - Is he blind? - Sorry, Mr. Holland. No, it's all right. Nah, he ain't blind. He's with us. - See what I'm saying? - I see. I want a good show, but I want you to win. All right? Let's do it, baby. - You ready for this, champ? - Yes, sir. Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the MCW Arena... Thank you for being here with me. I wouldn't want it any other way. And now here comes Ringo Duran. Jesus, Ringo. Now I know we're in the big time. Good to see you. Welcome back to the MCW 100: The Undiscovered. Now we are on match two today after Alonso Scott completely obliterated Seville "Fingers" Duarte earlier this afternoon in just 11 seconds. He certainly blew his load early. But all eyes are on this bout between Landon "The Brother" Popoff and... Who's this? Ringo Duran. Who-- who is that? And just like the sweater he's wearing, I'm sure Ringo... Okay, gloves. - You're good. - Making his way to the referee... All right, have a good fight. ...is the deadlier, dirtier half of the Popoff brothers... - Hey, big man. -...Landon "The Brother" Popoff. Get your fighter in here. Big man, how are you? Hey, Ringo. Don't pay any attention to all this garbage, all this shit. - Remember what we talked about? - Yeah. What did we talk about? Win the crowd-- - Win the fight. - That's right, that's right. All right. Good, you're good. Gloves. We good? Yeah yeah, you're good. Good luck. - How you feel, champ? - Great. Okay. Fighters. Okay, gentlemen, I want it hard but I want it clean. No gouging, no fouls, all right? Let's put on a good show. Touch gloves. It's a packed house tonight. - Packed. - Very nice. - Come on, Ringo. - Right out of the gate, Ringo. Let's go, let's go. Let's get a lid on him. Fight. Yes, yeah! I'm lovin' this! I'm lovin' this! Just hit him back. Wow, we are seeing something totally different right from the start from Ringo Duran. Thanks for stating the obvious, Emily. Float like a sledgehammer, sting like a dump truck-- no graceful dekes from Ringo as he comes firing out from the gates. I don't see a gimpy arm, man. I do not see a gimpy arm. Yeah! Yes! I've never seen a crowd love him so much. Neither has he. I hope it's something he plans on getting used to. Way to go, Ringo! Beautiful! Yeah! - Something like that? - Something like that. - Shit, I'll say. - Just shut up. Don't get all cocky on me here now. All you've really done is just piss this kid off, so keep your left up, protect yourself. Are you listening to me? All right, how's the arm feel? Like $100,000. See, getting cocky. Don't do that. The gloves-- use them. I didn't expect him to come at me so hard. He's supposed to be an old man. He ain't nothing. He ain't nothing. Go in there and finish this off. Fight! Get up, get up! Come on, man! Yeah, your guy is going down. And with just one swing of that mighty fist, The Brute has tipped over the Tower of Ringo. Metaphor isn't your strong spot, Emily. - Come on, man. - Ringo, get up. - No! - We're gonna have to stop. He's got something in his gloves. - Gotta fight back, son. - Hit him! - What the hell's he doing? - Losing. Let's see you fight. If I don't see you fight, I gotta deduct a point. Hey, stop. Blue corner. - One point. - What the fuck, ref? What the fuck? - Fight! - God damn it. - Oh, shit! - You got him, you got him! It's over! - Yes! - Yeah! No no no. Three punches with the other guy's fist. - The other guy's fist! - S-stop. Okay, winner by knockout: Ringo Duran. Ringo! Ringo Duran! I don't fuckin' believe it. I don't fuckin' believe it. Hello, this is Sergio Ponzo. Do you remember me? Good good. I'd like to meet with you. I have a proposition for you. Hey, Mr. Holland. God damn it, Alonso. You scared the shit out of me. Listen, I got a lot of shit going on. Why'd you want to meet anyways? I wanted to meet because you don't answer my phone calls. We had an arrangement, Christopher. What the fuck happened? First of all, you got a lot of goddamn nerve breaking into my office. - What are you, a fucking idiot? - I didn't guarantee you shit. You didn't guarantee me shit? You told me Ringo was gonna fall. I bet $100,000 of my own money on a 25:1 shot. You understand that? Now luckily for you I've figured out a way that you could be a little more personally invested in the next match. - I've done all I can do. - Really? You did all you can do? That's all you can do? I don't like getting backed into corners. When you're my fuckin' dog, I'll back you in any corner I want to. - You know what? This is some bullshit! - Bullshit? Enough enough! - I'll snap his neck right now. - Yeah? I don't think so. Because when your brains are splattered on the wall, you might lose a little coordination and that's a Jersey promise. Fuck. Now this is how it's gonna go down. They are going to fight and you are going to make a bet with your own money for me. And our man Alonso here is gonna make it a sure thing because he will take the fall. You got it? And you are my dog now too. So here's the deal. You take the fall, a full knockout in the second round. Anything before that will seem suspicious. But it absolutely can't be after the second round. - You got it? - This is messed up, man. No no, Alonso, this isn't messed up. This is business. Now this one right here... You're gonna bet this horse is really hard. I think he might be a pink. Pink is the name of the jockey? No, pink bays. Pink. - How you doing, champ? - Doing great. - What about the arm? - Arm's great. - Great? - Kara done wonders. - You did? - Yeah, I did. I'm getting a little worried about the head right now, that it's gonna split open on you again. It'll be fine. If it bleeds, they're gonna stop the fight. - It's not going to bleed. - If it does bleed-- this is what they're looking for. Could you relax? It's just another fight. Hey, the MCW marketing people just sent this down. The hell it's just another fight. I'm fine with the one I got, okay? What about the t-shirts and mugs? - Mugs? - Yeah. - Hi. - Just give us a second here. Thank you very much, kids. You gotta start focusing here. We're about to go into a major fight with this guy. The guy's gonna try and end this one really early, all right? He's very predictable, but he's gonna come with that left kick, left kick-- - Right hook. - That's right, that's right. The left kick, the left kick, the right cross. - You gotta be ready for that right. - Got it. That's 11 seconds. He's never seen a fight go longer than two minutes. This guy's got 25 amateur belts for Christ's sakes. Relax, I've read "Sports Illustrated" too. Well, okay, relax is not the point here. I'm just trying to say he's the golden boy. He's a lottery ticket winner. The pressure's on him, it's not on you. He couldn't grind it out out there if you were to give him coffee beans. He can't outlast you. That's how we're gonna win this. If he does connect with that right hand, you're gonna have to suffer through it. - Are you with me on this? - I'm ready. - Are you mad at me? - Not now. All right. I want you mad at Alonso. - I am. Now let's go. - All right, you ready? Come on, fight! Come on, you're kidding. What the fuck is Alonso doing? Yes! - Fight! - Worry about yourself, old man. - This is bullshit. - Come on. I'll give you two seconds to break this off or I'm going to fuck you up. What's going on? Let's finish this fight up. - What's going on? - I don't know. - Did they work something out here? - I don't know. Well, it seems Ringo has completely given up on Alonso. Actually, Emily, I think it might be the other way around. Take him, Ringo! Take him out right now! Come on, this is bullshit. That's the round. That's the round. What the hell are you guys doing in here, huh? What, are you ballroom dancing? I wait and wait and wait and he doesn't throw one punch. If he doesn't want the match and he's throwing you the match, then take it. Knock this guy out if that's what he wants. - Not without a fight. - What is wrong with this man? He won't do it. He only knows one way to fight. - All right, let's go. - Take him out right now. End it. All right, let's go. End it. Come on, right now. Let's end this one. Fight! You're making a fool out of yourself. You do what you do, I do what I do. Don't disrespect the cage, man. Hit me, old man. Yeah! How much? How much for selling out? - Fuck you, man! - There you go. There you go. Finish him! - Come on, you just gonna give up? - This is not Alonso Scott. I don't know who this fucking guy is. He's not Alonso Scott. It's Alonso Scott tonight. - Come on, fight! - Fuck it. There you go. Now we got a fight. Wait for it. Wait for it. And Alonso is back on the offensive. Now 20 seconds can be a long time. That's what I told your sister. You a Duran fan now, Christopher? Yes yes! Take him out right now! That's more like it. Come on. What the hell are you fighting for? That's it. That's the round. - Here you go. All right, champ. - Have a little water. You're way ahead in this fight. So if he mounts you, I want you to turn away. Full guard, all right. That's a necessity. We don't want that cut opening up again. I don't wanna lose this fight on a goddamn technicality. Remember, watch out for the left kick, left kick, - and you watch for... - Right hook. That's right. Left kick, left kick... - Right hook! - Okay, you're ready. Hey, fighters, let's go. Corners out. Fight! Good hit! - You're bleeding. - This ain't bleeding. He's not bleeding. He's fine. Let him go. It's over, it's over. Oh, yes! That's it, that's it. That's it, that's it. I didn't throw it, man. I didn't throw it. Good fight. Anything you wanna tell me, Pressure? Winner by judges' split decision: Ringo Duran. Way to go, Ringo! Look, he's not talking to anyone right now, okay? No pictures. No-- I'm not talking-- Raphael, they really want interviews. Well, let me ask him. No, he's not really talking right now. No, he's not really talking right now. No picture-- my sign? Well, I'm a Leo. Yeah, I don't know yet. Why? Why? Because the fucking fight just ended. The blood's not even dry yet. It's "The Patriot" now. Everybody wants to know how you feel about fighting Duran in a championship bout. You tell the press I'm gonna rip fucking Ringo Duran's head off! Yeah, Christopher "The Pressure" Holland is absolutely looking forward to fighting Mr. Duran for the championship title. Mm-hmm. Yeah, direct quote. We got our blockbuster, my friend. We got our blockbuster. Want a nut? No, thank you. I don't want any nuts. Suit yourself. Fuck off. Hey, Alonso, that was a great match last night. Saw it on Pay-Per-View. It was really exciting. - Well, the crowd seemed to like it. - They liked it? The crowd? Yeah, you liked it, huh? You son of a bitch! You son of a bitch! Do you know how much fucking money you cost me, you son of a-- Come on, man, you don't gotta do this. You don't-- you don't gotta do this, man. - Stop! - Stop? Stop? I thought you already made your decision. - You don't wanna live, right? - Yeah, I wanna live. - You wanna live? - I just can't take a dive, man. Can't take a fall? Bang! Son of a bitch. You know how much money you cost me? You're lucky that you can still be useful to me, yes? - Yeah, I can be useful. - Good. Christopher here is gonna finish what you started two weeks ago. Now you-- you are going to guarantee us the outcome of that fight or you're not gonna live to see the first round. I ain't gonna kill anybody, man. Alonso, don't you know you don't have to kill a man to kill him? - Hello, Razer. - Aw, shit. What's wrong with you fucking guys? - How are things with Pepper? - Amazing. Can you believe a girl like her with a guy like me? Yes, I can. Sometimes, Ringo, you throw shit out to the universe and it comes back as sirloin. - She's still teaching you poetry? - Yep. But I don't get half of what she's saying most of the time. - Does it bother you? - No, not at all. Makes me want to become better. Run! Alonso! Come on, run. Run! Link! Link, you okay? - Is that kid dead? - It was a fucking accident, man. Let's get the hell out of here. Come on. Are you okay? Are you okay? He should still be in for observation. The kid has no insurance. They said the best place for him would be in bed. He's gonna be okay. I saw him get hit. He's just a little guy. Is he okay? Where is he? Where is he? - Pepper, he's sleeping. - Kara, where is he? - What the hell happened to your arm? - Arm is fine. I just got him. I just got him. He just found me. Got yourself a nice new couch. It's nice. - What? - This never would have happened if I didn't let him hang around with me so much. You think not? Well, what about what you've done for him? I mean a kid like this with no real physical ability, no real kind of coordination-- to experience the things that he has... - The kid idolizes you, man. - Yeah, he picked the wrong idol. I don't know. No one ever forced this kid to be in your corner. He just showed up every day, day after day, all on his own. Yeah, look where that got him. Have I ever told you the story of what really happened at your mom's last fight-- versus Saffire Cassaday? - Have l? - I've read about it. Fuck that, man. I'm not talking about a goddamn newspaper account. I'm trying to tell you what really happened. I was there. I was in the corner for five merciless rounds. Your mom got into that ring versus Saffire Cassaday, she's trading blows with one of the meanest, deadliest competitors we'd ever come across. That Cassaday-Duran fight was touted as the female David and Goliath, except this time your mom was the one that was 12:1 and, man, did they ever put on a show. But Gracie, she was determined, right? I mean the look in her eyes-- wow, locked right in. And she was doing all right-- keeping Saffire back, keeping her off balance. Gracie had that beautiful right kick, would sweep up out of nowhere. But then the third round-- Saffire connected. She kicked her leg something fierce. Well, I tell you, you could hear the snap of bone clear up into the upper bowl. Gracie fell back. And by the time the ref got there to her, she was already back up on her feet. She was back up on her feet. You understand? Her leg was shattered, man, and she's trying to keep all of her weight on her right side. I mean, imagine what it's like trying to walk with a broke leg, but she's gonna finish it. A title fight, okay? A kickboxing fight. Had two more rounds to go. And I knew that wasn't your garden variety, average bone-crushing pain that she was going through. With every punch, with every kick-- and there were a ton of them-- every strike, your mom was looking at the face of God with that pain. She was still going through it. By the last round, it wasn't pretty. She was white, she was shaking and sweating, and, oh God, my-- my soul just kind of ripped apart for her. So I did it. I reached for the towel. I was gonna like just throw it into the ring and then I caught your mom's eye. She's shaking her head at me, no. "No," she said. She's not about to give this one up. She's not about to start quitting, not now. I mean after all she's been through with the leg and the rivers of blood and the sweat, all the sacrifices that she made. She's a mother. She had you. She felt she'd be throwing all that away. So she-- she just took it. For two more minutes I saw a woman with no legs under her stand and take that beating. I saw a woman, a mother with no strength left in her arms whatsoever and she's punching back. I saw a fighter that night in that ring and no one's gonna take that away from her, not never. Gracie-- she may not be around no more, but that night, that ain't dead. I'm not her. What, did you say something? I said I'm not her. Neither is Link. I think you'll find that there's more of her in both of youse than what you think. You know, when life throws this shit to you and throws you these kinds of curves, what else can you do? You fight. You gotta fight. - Did I win? - No. Welcome to the MCW 100: The Undiscovered. This is the main title championship between the current reigning champion of the world, the undefeated, undisputed Christopher "The Pressure" Holland, and his new contender, king of the amateurs, Ringo Duran. That's what the graphics say, Emily. You can read. - Big crowd. - It's a big match. Better be Pressure all the way. Okay, left arm is set, but don't block with it. It could pop out if Holland so much as sneezes on it. Got it-- crappy arm. Well, kid, here we go. This is it. Christopher "The Pressure" Holland. Athletic, he's strong, a submission expert. He's gonna come at you, try to put you on the canvas and then beat the ever-lovin' shit out of you. That's not good, so just don't let him do it. - And if I do? - Well, you're gonna fuckin' lose. - Got it. If he beats me, I'm out. - But no. Apparently I've been asking around and a little bird tells me that there's an issue with Mr. Holland in terms of concussions. He's had way more-- especially on the left side-- more than humanly possible. Maybe true, maybe not. But it's something we can use. So keep the fight on its feet, see if you can open up that left side of him. Maybe you could land that sweet right hook of yours and then you got a shot for a knockout. But otherwise, Ringo, I don't give you a prayer of lasting in there. Your confidence is overwhelming. Well, welcome to the NBA. You'll be all right. Tape it. Tape what? That's nice. A little extra punch in there. Okay, I like it. Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the Maximum Cage Warrior main event and title match between Christopher "The Pressure" Holland and-- here he is, the newly crowned king of the amateurs-- - Ringo Duran! - Good luck, Ringo. Here we go. Ringo Duran. You made it all the way, Ringo. Good for you. No thanks to you. - You used to be a fighter, right? - Yeah. - Act like one. - Good luck. And now, making his way into the arena, the reigning undefeated, undisputed champion, the man who put the MCW on the map-- Christopher "The Pressure" Holland. - Come on, champ. - Yeah. Let's lose the robe, please. Hey, don't you let 'em in. I'm right here, okay? I thought you didn't like the sight of suffering. Yeah, I don't, so don't suffer. I'll do the best I can. Thanks. Okay, gentlemen, this is a championship bout, so I'm gonna let you battle some, but keep it clean. Protect yourselves at all times. Give the people a show. Touch gloves. Okay, let's go, Ringo. Let's put him down. Fight! Shit. Come on, Christopher. Yeah! Pull it in! Corners. God! Fight! Don't trade with him. Don't trade punches with him. How long is this round? Take him out! Fuck! Yeah. Get up up! On your feet. On your feet. Guard guard guard. Get out of it. - Heads up! - Look out! Turn away! Get up up up! Block! Watch the takedown. Gotta take him fast. Okay, let's just finish this off right now. Oh, no, he's on his last legs. Let's end this fight right now. - Let's go! - Yeah! Man, come on! Gentlemen, fight! Keep it going, keep it going. - Yeah! - Yeah! He's done, ref. He's done. Come on, come on. Attaboy! All right, this is over. This is over. Put him away right now. Come on! - How you feeling, huh? - Good. You're dropping back on your right arm, man. Why are you dropping back? You're dropping back on your right. Why are you dropping back on your right? Drink water. She's right. Drink it. I like the way this is looking, but you gotta end it this round 'cause there ain't gonna be no other round. You hear me on that? Fight! Watch your range, watch your range. Hold on! Turn away, Ringo! Good. Come on, hit him! Turn away, Ringo! Don't tap out. Don't tap out, man. Turn away! Break break break. It's popped out. - It's broken? - Yes-- no-- I don't know. Pop it back. No, Ringo. I'm calling the fight. What? Pop it back! - You don't have to do this. - Do it, please. Fighters. Fight! This is over. Put him down right now! Come on, finish him off already. Get out of there, get out of there. Go, Ringo, go. Yeah! Oh, Jesus Christ! What the fuck are you laughing at? You know, the thing is, Mr. Ponzo, you can't fix the game, the game fixes you. Where do you think you're going? I'm over it, man. It's done. Fuck this guy. Hey, you know, the funny thing about destiny-- it has a way of sneaking up behind you and kicking your ass. You do what you do, I'll do what I do. Just get your ass back in that bar. You cost me a lot of money. I will shoot your ass! When destiny sneaks up behind you, you should hope he doesn't have his own gun. It's over. Go. I wish I could be there. You are. Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to introduce to you the newest Maximum Cage Warriors Professional World Champion... Ringo Duran! I saw a man with no legs under him at all stand, a guy with no arm punch back. I saw a fighter that night-- the king in his cage. Gonna hurt like hell. Gonna hurt like hell. Gonna hurt like hell. Now when you step into that cage, the first rule of fighting is don't get hit. Now I told you, don't-- don't-- don't get hit. You're gonna get hurt. The king in his cage. Get out of there alive. Now when you step into that cage, it's gonna hurt like hell. Don't get hit. It's gonna hurt like hell. If you break that rule, it's gonna hurt like hell. Live to win. It's gonna hurt like hell. Oh my God, it looks like Ringo's shoulder has popped out. He must have had a previous injury. He'll be fine. What are you doing later? Are you serious right now? I've had injuries. Are you hitting on me on national television? I wouldn't call it hitting. - I can't do this. - What are you, 5'8"? I'm done. Train. Cut!
