They both are the senior most couple of the family. They are good friend of Mr. Raj. Since he studied in the same school in which Mr. Raj studied. He is a well known stage artist. But he couldn't become a film star. Hello. Welcome. They've sent the banana stem. What do I do with it? Go to market and sell it. Send it to the wedding hall. He's Raghava. He's a jovial man. But he has great respect for his brother. It is? Okay. Hello. - Hello. He's Raja ram. He was born late. And also late is doing his work. A useless man. Excuse me. - I haven't received the sari yet. Why don't you call him? - You haven't received the sari yet? She's Bharati. And the man with her is her husband.. ...who is more like a slave to her. Raghupati, Raghava, Rajaman and Bharati. Their father was a freedom fighter. By the way, where is Rama? Rama? - Father? What's going on? Is this the way you behave in the presence of the guests? They are laughing. They are enjoying. If they were enjoying they would've clapped" ...and not laughed at you. Brother-in-law, I told you the other day.. ...to send him to college and get him educated. But look what he has become. I was not aware of the consequences for learning dance. Father. - Shut up. Swapna? Where is your cousin? He must he be on his way. Are you sure he's coming? My cousin will surely come. The auspicious period is nearing. I'm very much tensed about you. When I'm not tensed then why are you? It is me who's going to elope with my cousin. Oaky. - Brother.. ...we haven't received the wedding sari yet. Don't worry. Calm down. We should be leaving to the wedding hall in 20 minutes? We will be there in 10 minutes. He's intelligent with his talks.. ...and fast as an arrow. Raam, I'm suffering from blood pressure and diabetes. If you drive so fast, I won't die in the accident.. ...I will die of fear. I won't let you die. You're not God to save me from dying. Go slow. Otherwise, stop the bike. I will take a bus and reach the wedding hall on time. Priest, we are already running out time. And if you take a bus you will reach only after the consummation night. Oh God. Hello, priest. - Hello. How are you? - I'm lucky to be alive. Did he trouble you? I must say, your boy almost killed me.. "Speeding on this bike having me sit at the back seat. Then why are you late? Uncle, the priest was actually scared very much. That's why I'd to drive the bike slowly. - I see. Was that slow? - Yes. Thanks. - Raam, Swapna is waiting. Go and give it to her. Priest, please come in. Where to? - Come inside What's the matter? Since he drove the bike so fast, guess I lost my memory power. How is priest Ganapati? He's fine. But there's only one difference. - What is it? He doesn't eat oblation. Priest? - Yes? Do you eat oblation? My son Rama is an illiterate. He should kill himself. Thank you. Thank you very much. You're very naughty. Don't be confused. He likes to be degraded more than being appreciated. Then what was the need to give birth to him? Why are you late? Making arrangements for the register marriage isn't easy. It is difficult to convince the registrar and the peon. He's right. Here's the wedding sari. Get ready soon. Please take everybody's blessings for the last time. Okay? - Okay. Cousin, I love you so much. - Me too. Get ready. - Okay. This puppy's mother is with me. But what's the point? You even don't know where to kiss the dog. These days, dogs have more value than human begins. Why? - Since it is the dog the heroine kisses in the film.. ...when the hero betrays her. Why are you feeling jealous? There are some who are born as human beings.. ...instead of being born as dogs. Raam, what's the matter? Tell me? - Stand here. I will tell you. Swapna? Come. Doesn't she look beautiful? You're right. What's the hurry? We could've met her later, right? Probably, you won't get a chance to see her again? What do you mean? - You will be tired after the wedding. And you will weep when you bid her adieu.. ...and that's really bad. You must bid her adieu happily, right? You're right. - Seek their blessings. Come on. - God bless you. Raam, come here? We thought you were still a child.. ...and you knew nothing. But you're too intelligent. - Thank you. Wait a minute. You told us you would give us a surprise. What's the surprise? Go to Swapna's room after 10 minutes.. ...you will know it yourself. - I see. Surprise after 10 minutes. I wonder what the surprise could be. 10 minutes has passed. Swapna? Swapna? Swapna? Brother-in-law! Why haven't they come yet? Why are you in a hurry.. ...when the couple who are about to get ruined are not in a hurry? I was supposed to get Saif Ali Khan and Kareena Kapoor married. They've other elderly people to bless them.. ...but for this marriage you're the only elderly person. Why are you late? He needs to attend Kareena Kapoor's wedding. Sign here. Right here. Congratulations. How could anyone not realize what's going on in this house? What are you all doing in this house? None of us knew that he would give us such a surprise. Swapna made a mistake hiding about her love to us. And he made a bigger mistake supporting her. He ruined our family reputation. Hereafter, no one will talk to him nor talk about him. If not for my cousin, we wouldn't have got married. Got it? That doesn't mean to touch my feet for blessings. I don't like it. You're right. I too don't like it. You can at least thank me, right? It was your duty. Why should I thank you? Well said. Look Bhaskar, Swapna is my uncle's only daughter. What do mean? Even I'm the only son to my parents. Don't mistake me. I understand. Even I left my parents like Swapna. I got a good job in New Zealand. We are leaving tonight. And don't worry. She'll be happy- Good. Swapna, I must say, he's a nice guy. You have bright future. But I have a doubt about my future. No doubt you're in trouble now. They will not allow you inside the house. What will you do now? I will go back to Bellary. I will be completing my engineering in six months. I will think about the rest later. GOPi? - Yes? Come here. Where is Raam? On the way. Losers will always remain losers. - You're right. He means to say us. Idiots. Dear friends, due to financial crisis.. ...Raam's father couldn't him pocket money. So as a friend, I'm taking care of all his expenditures. Here you're. Are you happy? Thank you. Never hesitate in helping one another. Did it really hurt you? She didn't hurt me, she actually touched my heart. I really enjoyed it. Raju, even I'm a poor student. - I will surely help you. Help me too. - Help me too. Now I've become a poor student. That's why nobody politician comes forward to solve poverty issue. Hello? - Hello. This is Reema calling from telephone company. Tell me? We've introduced a new scheme called family planning. Family planning? Unbelievable. Sir, if any member of your family is running a business.. ...in another place or studying in a another place.. ...you can talk to them for free. I'm not interested. Hang up. Darn it. Hello? - Mother, why is uncle still upset with me? Wrong number. Hello? - I'm Brahma speaking. I'm a Radio Jockey. I'm Rama alias Ramanand. Oh, so sweet. I watched your dance program some days ago. You were great. Will you please perform on our radio station? Oh. Thank you very much. Just a minute. Father, they watched my performance on the radio. They are very happy- They want my program in radio city. Life is so beautiful. Father, what do I tell them? - You fool. How it is possible to watch your dance on the radio? You're such a fool. Give me the phone. Excuse me. My uncle wants to talk to you. You can never fool me, remember that. Hang I-PI- Hi. - What is it? Heard you're excited staying away from you parents, right? Yes. - I'm also excited about it. Shut up. I'm not a lowly girl. Even I'm not a lowly guy. My boss always advices us to enjoy every moment of life. Why is she crying? - She's crying unnecessarily. She's isn't insane to cry unnecessarily. Tell n1e the truth. I asked her to be my date since she's alone in the hostel. Okay. What was your reply to it? I didn't reply to him. - You must do it. How dare you hit me with the slipper? When the American president got hit by slipper.. ...you are not big deal. You should've thought about it before messing with her. Hey. How dare you hit the guy from my area? Your area? - I rule Bellary. I rule entire Karnataka. I think you're doing wrong. I know whether I'm doing right or doing. I'm ready to face anyone. - You're ready? Fight me. Hey you. - You. Stop it! You think this to be a college or a market? Why are you behaving like goons? He'd a query.

I think, we'll get it this side. - Hello, how many times do I tell you? Why are you getting angry now. If I would've caught hold of your waist". ...we could've boarded the train. You screamed at me for doing so, and look where we landed. Do you expect me to stay quiet when you catch my waist? Do you think you have Shilpa Shetty's figure? I don't need to do all this for you. - Hello.. don't do all this drama. When I said I don't want friends, you convinced me. You were spinning stories to me near the inn. I know all that was for me.

This happens if you hurt some good people like me. What happened now? If I have to help you, I need to hold you by your waist". ...and if I do that, you'll scold me. Holding waist is not more than saving my life. I won't tell you anything if you hold me anywhere. First, save me. Please. You look thin, but you are heavy. What is it? Is it head weight, bone weight, or attitude? What did you say? - If you get angry, I'll leave you. No. no. Sorry. Sorry. This problem wouldn't have aroused.. ...if you would've let me hold your waist earlier. We could've gone in a train. This waist.. - Shut up. If you allowed me to touch your waist now.. ...you would've allowed me to touch it while we were boarding the train. The thing is that, first time when I hold your waist.. Oh.. please, stop this topic now and talk something else. What do I talk now? Nothing? Malashree said that.. ...you got bowled seeing an unconscious girl in the car. That's the reason I say.. don't say anything to these women. They reveal everything. They can't hide a secret.. Forget that.. I don't know who's the girl you love.. ...you don't know where she is.. ...you even don't know whether you'll meet her or not. But I met her. - Where? Here. - What? I mean, in my heart. Okay. Okay. Even if you meet her.. ...don't know whether she'll fall in love with you or not. Look, I don't have any answer for that. Trust is the key of love. I want that. Tippayya, like your name.. you have hay in your head. Thanks.. in the morning, the waist.. Please, I am feeling sleepy. Good night. Where did she go? Hey, what are you doing here? I got so tensed. Why did you get tensed? That too for me? Don't you think I'll get tensed. Fine.. give me your hand. 'I'll teach you a lesson now. You show attitude to me..' Hey Cadbury's. Hey Cadbury's.

You are Jeans pant Jogiyya. You are talking like a poet. Tillllayya, you are a fool. You try to show attitude. You see the guy's background.. ...and you fall for him. Even if we smile at you.. ...you break the signal. Hello. - Tell me. - You are like virus. Hello. - Tell me. - Even you are not pure. She will talk about your history. She'll betray you at the end.

My mom and dad died in an accident. So, priest brought me up. I've got a seat in the medical college too. But it will be 15 days by the time the college reopens. So, I've to make arrangements for the books and hostel. Why do you want to stay in a hostel when we have a such big house? Am I right, brother-in-law? - Absolutely. Priest is like incarnation of God to us. Not only 15 days, you can stay here as many days as you want. Take the blessings. You are the devotee who sacrificed your son.. ...entered the wheel and killed the enemies. Uncle is so proud to see the shield. Yes, he always does that. Since childhood he's.. ...crazy about drama and movies. In fact, he got a state award for playing Duryodhana. Do you know who awarded him? His favorite actor. Dr. Raj kuma r. So, he doesn't step out of the house without seeing it. Ask him why did he come here? You are talking to the people who eloped and got married.. ...why aren't you talking to me? So, I came here. She did everything without knowing. No, she did everything intentionally. She threatened n1e at the last moment saying.. ...if I don't marry Bhaskar, I'll die. That too our house girl. She shouldn't die. So, I got them married. So, you stopped sending money order to me. When I went to the doctor for gastric problem" ...he said, I am an anemic and my bones are weak. He needs a big medical shop for the problems he said. Isn't it? I didn't have money even for 30 ml. Brother-in-law, did you hear that? He's talking about 30 ml. Hello.. 30 ml doesn't mean liquor, Rama. I am talking about medicine. Tell n1e if you are still angry with n1e. I'll go and sleep under a flyover. - oh. Pooja, you were brought up by the priest. If you say, it is like priest commanding us. Tell me.. can we forgive him? Actually, you shouldn't forgive him. But by seeing his face it seems as though.. ...he can't stay without you. Uncle, forgive him. Okay, I'll forgive him as you are telling me. Tell him to go inside. Uncle, thanks a lot. Thank you. Sorry, uncle. I won't repeat this mistake again. Daddy.. daddy.. Your dad is here. - Sorry.. Daddy.. daddy.. Come on, let's go inside. Did you see that dear? Everyone is so happy to see him. He was away from us because of my sister's daughter.. ...he's always like that. He solves everybody's problems. Good boy. Very good. You acted very well. But be careful. Everyone are brilliant in my house. Fine.. do you know how to do hiccups. - What? Oh sorry, you are from America, so you won't understand this. Hiccups" - Why? From now on whenever you have to talk to me.. ...act like you've got hiccups. That will be our secret code. Okay? Okay, TipPaYYa- My name is not Tippayya, but Raam. Okay. Okay. - Yeah. Yeah. He's got hurt on the head and have lost lots of blood.. ...so he's in coma. - What's coma? He'll be alive, but can't recognize anyone.. ...can't talk to anyone. Just assume him to be a living corpse. No, get him in his senses soon. You have to. Before Narsimha comes to his senses.. ...the man who was reason for all this should die. Okay, sir. Aunt, it is like this, isn't it? - Sister, the junior priest is here. Where did he go? Why did you lie to us? Lied.. I didn't lie to you. Did you see? Your hiccups stopped. This is called shock treatment. I am an expert in giving shock treatment. What's the matter? I heard junior priest is here. I'll definitely get caught now. What do I do? Fried rice. Fried rice. If you mix curd rice with fried rice.. ...you'll get a new kind of rice. Fried rice. Priest, if you would've told me you are coming here.. ...I've would've brought you here in my bike. I've given up all my desires after I became a priest. I only have my life with me now. Why do you want to kill me? How are you? - All are fine since Pooja came here. Pooja? Who's she? It was sent by senior priest. ' PUPPY? Don't call it as puppy- Uncle has named it as Pooja. Oh, like a cow in front of Lord Shiva.. ...your uncle wants a puppy.. You are addressing it as puppy again. You'll get into trouble if you do this. Greetings, priest. - Greetings. My master has send this oblation to you. His love is protecting all of us till now. Please, have a seat. Where's Pooja? - She's coming. Have coffee. Priest.. did your master ask anything about Pooja? Why will he ask? He knows it will be safe in your hands. He knows it. Pooja has become our family member. She's a very nice girl. 'Rich people are unpredictable.' It has put on weight, isn't it? She just looks fat, but she doesn't eat at all. She feels shy. 'Do even dogs feel shy?' It won't bite, isn't it? She isn't a small girl to bite you. It has to be married now. 'They want to get the dog married?' Is priest looking for alliance for Pooja? 'I think all have become crazy and has to be admitted in the asylum.' He doesn't have such plans yet. It will surely find a mate one day. Anyways, it is a free bird, isn't it? Correct. She doesn't have parents. If I stay here one minute more, I'll go crazy. I shall leave now. Give our regards to Ganapati priest. - Sure. Have food and leave. I am observing a fast today. Who's this girl? She's a new maid of our house. Her name is Kumari. She's good. It's okay. Oh God. Who? Who did this? Who broke this? Uncle, it is me. What? By mistake, it fell down. By mistake? Do you know what memories mean? Do you know their value? You say you've been brought up by the priest. ...don't you know how to behave in somebody else's house. Even you are out of your mind. Why are you so lenient towards the guest? You are a guest here. Behave as a guest. That's the reason, I am leaving you. Brother-in-law.. - What is it? It was not Pooja who broke the shield. - What? Who? It was I. Pooja, come here for a minute. My family members fear to tell the truth to me. Why did you lie to me? Uncle, your family members respect you a lot.. ...they even fear you. Their hearts are delicate than the shield that broke. If you would've told something to aunt in anger.. ...she would've felt bad. Then you would've felt bad as you scolded them. I know. That's the reason, I lied to you, uncle. I am sorry, dear. - Uncle, why are you apologizing to me? Nothing wrong, dear. I know many families break because of a small misunderstanding. Though you are young, you thought it over.. ...you saved our family from breaking.. ...and have kept our memories intact. May God bless you, dear. I thought, why to fight over that glass shield.. I thought I would tell you that! broke it. I would've whacked you if you would've told me that. It is good that I didn't say anything. This girl's name is Bhavani. Father is a millionaire. Are they so rich. They don't know about their earnings. She's fair, but the earning is black. This girl is weak in education.. but nice girl. Is it okay for you? I agree 30%. But not the girl, her father.. the millionaire. That means, you didn't like her. Disaster. This girl's name is Suparna S. She was born in US. No brothers or sisters. Father is IPS and mother is IAS.

Why did you signal me when I was doing an important work? Like a commercial break. You said you liked a girl. Can't you wait for her? Where do I find that girl now? What's the guarantee that I'll find her if I look for her? It is good that I forget her. Did you call me to say this? Shall I leave now? Hey.. one minute. What happened? Will you agree to the marriage by just seeing her photo? Then, what can I do? You have to see that girl directly. You should feel that she's born for you. You should be ready to take any risk for that girl. Whatever you said, that girl possess that qualities in her. If you can't understand still now, you are not a human being. Hey, lower your voice. Why are you bothered if I marry anyone? I am your friend, I don't want you to get ruined.. ...why should I bother if you marry any Subamma. It is not Subamma, it is Suparna. Raam, what did you decide in the bathroom? Tell me soon. Uncle, I feel.. I don't want to marry that girl. You said 90% you agreed to that girl. But there should be 100% in life. Tell me what kind of a girl do you like? Seeing the girl, I should feel that she's born for me. I should feel like I should be ready to take any risk for that girl. I should feel that if necessary, I should lie to my family members too. It was in my heart for a long time.. ...but now I feel it has got lost.

There's no definite language for love. I am telling you the truth. I like your lies too. It was in my heart for a long time.. ...but now I feel it has got lost. You kissed me in my dreams.. ...I am shying away from myself now. Go, go. Don't show me attitude. I saw the whole world, but I didn't see crazy guy like you. When the cold breeze in the night troubles me. I missed you as my body became hot. Forget about the scorching heat. In my dreams, I got drenched with you in the rain and fell sick. I have a desire to have petty fights with you. I feel like writing a poem on your back. Come and sit closer to me. Shy a bit more. It was in my heart for a long time.. ...but now I feel it has got lost. You kissed me in my dreams.. ...I am shying away from myself now. It is wrong to talk too much. Tell me something, 0 dear. Hey Raam, as soon as I became a classical dancer.. ...do you think my behavior too will be classy? No. I won't spare anyone then. Hey kid, hooliganism doesn't suit your body language. Anyways, tell me the matter. First.. first.. First you ruined my sister's life. Now you are snatching away Pooja from my heart. What's the matter.. - Don't touch me, okay? Why? Didn't you have bath today? Fine. Pooja didn't come looking for you. She came here as I sent her here. What rubbish? Do you know what actually happened? The music is being played. Let's stay together. Let's be with my love. There's something.. - Kumari.. no one is to be seen at home. Everyone went to meet Ganapati priest. Where is that girl, Pooja? They took her along. What?

You want me, don't you? Let's go. Goddess Chamundeshwari.. ...I came here with a problem" ...you gave me what I wanted. I didn't know where to take her until she gets her.. ...visa and passport I brought her home, uncle. You love Pooja. They don't look like humans. Poor girl, Pooja. Dear, it is wrong to leave the one you love when they are in need. I gave you cars, men, and money that you asked for. Don't you feel ashamed to say you didn't find her? If you don't find them, I'll chop you into pieces. You are our servants, you should obey our orders. We want Pooja. Pooja! See who it is! Brother-in-law, let go off me. Let go off me! 'Hey Partha, you can't acquire me by bad means.' 'You don't have the power in you.' 'I am the warrior of the..' Thank you. - Why? Because you came for me. I didn't come for you.

This is the time set by the nature.. ...for our hearts to meet. This is the story of our love.. ...which will not end. I want to live with you in every birth. This is a new beginning for us. I liked you. I am not content with your love. My heart can never forget you. Love is beautiful only because of you. It is an immortal and .. - Sweet passion. You be with me always. It is like heaven. Raam, my mother likes her brothers very much. So, she convinced my father.. she got her brothers married.. ...to his sisters. Then, we settled in abroad with my father. No matter wherever they go, but this village is their favorite. No matter how busy my father would be.. ...he would celebrate my birthday with everyone in this village. One day.. my uncles fought because of property" ...and the family broke. My parents wished that they should reunite.. ...and my marriage should take place in everyone's presence. But it didn't happen. They both died in an accident. I couldn't stay in America, so I came here. My uncles forcefully tried to get me married. What do we do now? One idea. What happened? Where had you been? I escaped from uncle Nagappa. Come on, let's go. When we enquired about them, we realized that.. ...there's only one auditor to both the families. He comes once in a week for their bank work and auditing.. ...work from Basawana Halli. His name is McDowell Murthy. Hello MC Murthy here. I am Sukumari speaking. - Tell me. You took so much of money with you.. I called to know whether you deposited it in the bank safely.. ...or somebody would've hit on your head and took that money.. ...and you are lying in a hospital. Is this your love or your intuition? Nothing like that.. It is just 25 lakes, I've carried cores of rupees till now. Hang the phone. Boss, give me a DD challan. What? - Sir, it is here. Take this. Thank you. - Welcome. Sir, there's ink on your shirt. My suitcase. - What's the matter, sir? My suitcase. My suitcase. Not one or two.. there were 25 lakes in it. They stole my bag.. - Sir.. The man who stole it wouldn't stay here. Go out and look for him. Sukku.. Sukku.. open the door. Why are you in a haste? What happened? - I'll tell you later. Pack your bags. Lets leave from here. - What happened? Somebody stole 25 lake rupees from me. If sir knows this he'll kill both of us. They robbed you? They didn't hit on your head or break your leg. How did you lose it? - To hell with you. I am tensed and you are mocking at me. They are here. They'll kill us. What do I do? If anyone asks for me, tell them I am not at home. Is this MC Krishnamurthy's house? I don't know. This briefcase had his name and address. So, I thought I would return it to him. Didn't I say, I don't know anything? How are you related to him? I'll ask him and tell you after he returns. Hey, shut up. - Mr. Murthy? Yes, it is me. Thank God. Where did you get this briefcase? I was drinking tea inside the bank. One man was running with this briefcase. I got a doubt. I caught him and thrashed him. I saw your name and address on the briefcase. So.. That fool stole my briefcase. But you stole my heart, dear. What's your name, dear? Raama Krishna Parmahamsa. Everyone calls me Raam. You are like Lord Ram to me. Take this Rs. 10. Hide it or someone will steal it. Sir, which shopping center do I go to spend this money? Sir, I don't want money. Just give n1e one meal and water to drink. Okay. Sukku! - What is it? Did you keep the food in the fridge last night or you threw it? I've kept it in the fridge. Serve him. Let him eat and leave. Go dear, have food and leave. - Okay, sir. Why did you come to this village? Sir, there's a famous auditor named MC Krishnamurthy in this village. He's an inspiration for youths like us. Like Abdul Kalam for the scientists. Bill gates for software engineers. The same way MC Krishnamurthy for the auditors. So, I've come here to become his disciple. You are very lucky. Take this chicken. You are looking for MC Krishnamurthy.. ...it is me. Sir, it is you? One more surprise for you. I've fixed an appointment. Sir.. thanks a lot, sir. Thank you. Don't get too excited, dear. The salary they give is very less. Come on. Even I know that you'll have to eat bones if you are living with a dog. What are you watching? Get the poppadums for him. Look.. we have only two clients in our company. One is senior Mallaya and the other is junior Mallaya. Both are fingerprints. Illiterates. I'll ask you something now. How many times do you pay income tax in a year? Only once.. - But I pay 10 times in a month. That's wrong, sir. Isn't it? The one who survives on black money is also wrong, isn't it? I look innocent, but I am a dangerous man. If you continue to do the same, you'll die one day. What did you say? - Sir, you are superb. Superb! Your life changes from today. Give me that mug. Give it to me. Cheers. What's that sound? - Sir, I got a message. Do you have a mobile? - I took it in installment. They are allergic to mobiles. They'll cut your signal then. Throw that. Do as I say. - Okay, sir. Greetings, sir. - What about Babu Nagraj, Murthy? Sir, no one can confront you. So, people back out hearing your name. Sir, this is the oblation for you. Sir, all this is for you. Who is he? - He's from my village. I've hired him as an assistant. - Hey! Didn't I tell you that no one should know about our business? Sir, he's none other than my sister's son. My late brother-in-law's son. Sir, see. We both resemble each other. Same to same. We both resemble each other since childhood. Same to same. Will I become like you when I grow old, brother-in-law? Shut up. Does he have any experience? Chicago Chandrashekhar is in America. He's a very rich man, sir. They've got property worth 500 cores. He takes care of their accounts. Brother-in-law, who is Chicago Chandrashekhar? Shut up. Yes, sir. - Brother-in-law it is wrong to lie. If I tell the truth, you'll have to take me to the cemetery. My lovable son is here. Come here, my lion cub. Murthy, how are you? Hello, sir. I am fine. Who's this? - He's my nephew. Doesn't he have manners to greet me? You'll surely die. - What did you say? It is said that if elders greet young children, they die. Shall I greet you? - No. Murthy. Bow down. - No, sir. I've got cold today. Bow down. - No, sir. I am getting late to the school. Bow down, Murthy. - No, sir. Bow down! - Okay, sir. If I thrash you, you'll mix up in the sand. VET'? 900d, my son. Hey Dodda Malla. You idiot. You alone eat food of 10 people. What's wrong with you? Instead of doing all this, can't you commit suicide and die? Grandpa, everyone mocks at me in the school because of my plait. You are like a buffalo, so it is obvious that they'll mock at you. Mother! - Get lost! If you agree, I'll cut this plait. Dodda Malla! It is not just a plait. It is the pride of our family. Slit their throats whoever mocks at you. But dare you tell me that you want to cut this plait. Okay, grandpa. He doesn't understand my plight. I am so unfortunate. Sir.. - What's it! Sir, I am getting late. - So? I've to pay income tax. - How much? Sir, 15 lake rupees. - 15 lake rupees? Yes, sir. I was accounting whole night. I got psyched doing so. 'Hey Partha, you can't acquire me by bad means.' 'You don't have the power in you.' 'I am the warrior of this motherland.' 'Your sins have increased now.' Naga, what's the matter? I heard the same voice again. The one who hit on my head is here. Sir, you managed it so well. Or you can't live in between demons like them. Sir, I got so angry when that fat boy was hitting you. That's the reason I charged 15 lakes from them. Great, sir. You are great. You were standing stunned there. Sir, you lie so much. Don't you get tensed? I keep lying when time comes. You don't get tensed. I have over.. over creativity in me. Did you understand? - Yes, sir. What? - I'll have to enact as you when time arises. Come, sir. Hi Happy, how are you? I had never thought I would live like this. My happiness got ruined since I gave you a lift. I've thought of an idea now. If you follow it.. ...your freedom is guaranteed. Sir, I've thought of a wonderful plan now. - What? Sir, you should know who abducted your daughter-in-law, isn't it? Get your photo album, I'll tell you. What kind of an idea is this? Hey, go and get the photo album. - Okay, sir. Get it soon. I want to go home. Tell n1e one thing.. you took so long to get this idea. Not him.. it is him.. it is him, sir. Take this. He's not from our side. - Okay, fine, sir. Tell me properly or I'll smash your face. Then you keep writing on it. Oh God.. I am sure it was him. Today it is him and tomorrow.. You may leave now. - Okay, sir. Thanks a lot, sir. Thanks a lot. Sir, I've told you once and I am telling you again.. Tippayya is very dangerous. He won't let this marriage take place. Be careful, sir. I shall leave now, sir. - Hey! Brother.. - Stop there. Why? - If you are telling it for my good.. ...then stay here till this wedding takes place. Sir, what's this? Sir, I beg of you. I have wife and children waiting for me. Sir, let go off me. Please. - Take him from here. Take him from here. - Please, sir. Let go off me! Let go off me! Murthy, I heard Dodda Malla won the case of liquor. Forget about that. I've got an idea by which.. ...you can become the president of that association. Yes, sir. - Who is he? He's my sister's son. His name is Raam. Greet him. - Greetings, sir. Sir, he's an expert in accounts. Chicago Chandrashekhar is in America. He's a very rich man.. he was working with him earlier. Sir, Dodda Malla had already had an eye on him. I said, it is not possible. I said, he'll check both of your accounts. Both of our accounts? Like you.. Chicago Chandrashekhar.. ...had a brother named Dollars Dinesh. He used to maintain both of their accounts. - Yes. Sir, the account has been done. If you see it once.. I don't know all that. You see it and pay the tax. Thanks, sir. - father-in-law, don't say that. It is said that you have to keep an account even if you throw peels out. I got bored and couldn't find any book to read.. ...and I saw last year's accounts book. There's a difference of Rs. 13 in it. Rs. 13, uncle. That's it? Let it be. Father-in-law, that's not the case. Today he's take Rs. 13, tomorrow it can be 13 lakes. You are right, dear. Murthy, show all the accounts to my daughter-in-law from now on. Hey you.. - Yes, madam. Are you his assistant? - Yes, madam. Do you know English? - Yes, madam. A little. Get all the accounts book in my room. Somehow manage to settle things. You taught me to lie. See howl lie to them now. What is that? - Nothing, dear.. you go. Come. Hey Murthy. The government says right. If you are educated.. you'll have no outstanding loans to pay. You know it first. My cousin keeps falling on me. Settle his accounts first. Is that all? First settle my accounts. Please. - Raam, somebody may see us. Is that all? Close your eyes. No one will see you. Raam, no. - Please, please. Raam, no! - Oh God. Hey, I am sorry. Sorry. Please, sorry. Stupid. I don't know if he'll settle the accounts or get me killed by them. Let me see what accounts he's doing. You shouldn't be just wearing good clothes and roaming about.. ...you should be very.. hey Murthy! Why are you sweating so much? Nothing.. - Just because she's taking care of the accounts now? She's my daughter-in-law. Don't take her so easily. Sir, even I came to know that now. You came to know it, isn't it? Come on, let's go. Sir, you leave. I'll talk to my nephew and come. My daughter-in-law won't let him to talk to you. Let they continue, you come with me. It is okay if they continue, but if somebody sees them.. ...it will be a big problem. I am telling you nothing will happen. Come with me now. - Okay, sir. Their wish. Sir.. - What is it? Sir, she's going into madam's room. Let she check too. Forget it. No sir, my nephew" he's very young, sir. Even my wife is experienced. She'll explain it to them. You come with me. - Is it? Pooh? Pooja is like my daughter. She should live happily. That's the only thing I wish for. It is not possible if she's here. So, you both leave from here. Aunt, Pooja loves you as much as you do to her. I don't want her to miss you all because of me. Like her parents wishes.. ...our marriage should take place with your blessings. It will take place. - But.. people here are fools. They don't understand anything. The one who's dumb can go around the world.. ...but the one who's intelligent can make the world go round. Sir, I managed it very well. You are really great, sir. I'll smash your face now. - Why, sir? My body is burning. - What happened, sir? I saw you and her rolling on the bed. She fell on me first. But you shouldn't have seen it stealthily. Do you expect me to take a ticket to see that? Hey fool, it is a common scene in rich people's house. You shouldn't get carried away. Go.. go and finish your work. Go. - Sir. I told you to show the accounts, but you're trying to show book to her. Come on. What's this? Somebody may see us. So, do you expect me to be quiet? Shall we go to the theater? So, we can do everything there. Yes. I think it is.. mask man. Hey, remove your hand. You said we'll do everything in the theater? Did I say that? - Yes. I am famished. Please, get something to eat. Is it? Wait, I'll get something to eat. Hey, who are you? Krish. - You were in the movie. What are you doing here? I wanted to show you a film. - What? I heard that you are going closer to that girl and troubling her. So, I came here to teach you a lesson. How can you teach me a lesson? I'll give you a sound thrashing. Try it. - Try? I'll escape. Krish? You said Krish thrashed you. How is it possible for him to come out of the screen and thrash you? Is he in the whole movie? He came out and thrashed me when he had time. He's right, dear. He's got thrashed by him, so why will he lie to us. Why are you standing here hearing our stories? Come inside. I have to check accounts. - Okay, madam. Madam.. the female who's getting married.. ...shouldn't get tensed about the accounts. Sir, tell her not to check. - Murthy, why are you saying that? She's the one who has to take care of the accounts tomorrow. You take him with you, dear. - Okay, father-in-law. I'll go. I'll tell you in detail when I return. Come on. Murthy, you start sweating profusely whenever.. ...she talks about the accounts. Sir, you can't reveal some things. If I say, I'll get killed. If I leave, they'll bear children. Accounts..

Let's go for a jolly ride. The old love story. I don't know why I am feeling so bored. - Is it? Let's dance at least two steps. New song and music. The old love story. Song.. sing a song. Song.. sing a song. Johnny Johnny, yes papa. Eating sugar, I10 Pal- You should say it in Kannada. Say it with a little love. I love you.. to say this.. ...I get very tired. What can I say? You are very lazy. Let there be some gap between us. New song and music. The old love story. What is it? I am crazy about you. I am crazy about you. Give me a kiss. Let's bet. Let's play head and push. My kiss is very costly. Let's climb some mountain and dance there. I have better work to do. Instead of singing this song.. ...what better work do you have? Enough of singing and dancing now.. ...let's share our joys and sorrows now. We'll name our future baby. New song and music. The old love story. You are very slow. The world is very fast. Be careful when with me. New song and music. I don't know why I am feeling so bored. - Is it? Let's dance at least two steps. New song and music. The old love story. Raam said he'll be coming. But he's not come yet. He will surely come. Sister. Mother. - Pooja. My dear. Jyoti. - How are you, sister? I'm fine. Why don't you also go inside the temple? I cannot climb the stairs. Let God come down himself. How's that possible? I don't care. Then why did you come? You could've stayed at home? Since my grandma has gone to meet her secretly.. ...my grandpa has sent me to keep a watch on her. How are you, Gunda? - Don't touch me. She's your elder. Hey. Don't you dare into our personal matters? Who are you? Are you Spiderman? - Yes. Why did you come here? To know who great. You or me. This is my area. You cannot mess with me. - Alright. Please forgive me. Hereafter, will you respect your elders? - I will. My grandpa is a powerful man. If you talk about your grandpa" ...I will nail you too like him. No. Will you respect your elders? - Okay. Turn around. - Why? I'm going to cut your plait. That's the identity of our family. To hell with your family. Turn around. Now, I only cut your plait. If you don't respect your elders, I will cut you to pieces. Gunda, shall I give you bath? - No. It is better to do our work ourselves. Oh my God. You've reform so much. Spiderman reformed me. Hello? - Uncle.. ...uncle Chikmali is planning to get me married. I don't want to get married. I will only marry your son. Otherwise, I will kill myself. Dear, don't worry. I will come right away. Nagappa, summon our men. Let's go to Chikmali's house and finish everyone. Sir, wait a minute. - Hey you. Why are you concerned about his family? Not just I, you too should be concerned about them. If you get your son married to your sister's daughter.. ...how much will you get? 100 corer US dollar. Why do you want to fight your brother for mere money? Mere money? If you get your married to the girl who can get you 500 cores.. ...it will be like you've attained victory over Chikmali, right? You're right, but who is that rich man who'll give me 500 cores? There is a man. - Where? Uncle, tell him about Chicago Chandrashekar. Oh. He? Also tell him about his wealth and properties. Probably, it worth round 500 cores. Tell him about his daughter. - Daughter? The daughter who's grown up? He's right. In that case, won't they look for a guy? You're right. - Then why don't you tell? Tell what? About who? Tell them about our sir's son Nagappa. Murthy, I don't care how. You must somehow see to that.. ...they get the daughter married to my son. Understand? - No. Idiot. - I understood. In that case, explain to your uncle briefly. Having sympathy I took good care of you.. ...whereas you're putting me in trouble. Sir, what wrong did I do? What wrong did you do? I lied about Chicago Chandrashekar to save myself. But you are trying to make it true? How will we create Chicago Chandrashekar now? Tell me? Dear.. - What is it? Someone by the name Chicago Chandrashekar.. ...called five times since morning. He's looking for a guy in this place. So, he wants you to book a guest house for him. Oh God. Sir, what do you say now? You spoke about him because you know him. He called since you know him. I swear by God. I didn't understand a thing. Sir, I understood everything. - Understood what? It is called subconscious memory power loss. Don't try to manipulate me. There are three stages in our mind. Conscious, subconscious and unconscious. Probably, you're suffering from subconscious. It is like, though you know the person well.. ...and if you don't meet for a many days.. ...you tend to forget the person" ...but you do know the person. At times you remember him.. ...like the way you remembered him now. You're not insane to mention his name though you don't know him? You think he has discussed about his daughter's marriage with me? Of course, insane. Don't call me insane. I might doubt myself. It's okay if you doubt yourself, but you doubt me. I'm hurt. I'm leaving. - Raam. Don't leave me and go. Let's go and take a look at the submarine. It's not submarine, subconscious memory power. First stage? - No. Second. I've neither heard of him nor meet him. What do I do? The character that I created is asking me to book a guest house. What's going on? That's subconscious memory power. Murthy, for how long should I wait? Is he coming or not? How will I be able to tell you when I don't know myself? He will be coming. Please sit inside. Hello, sir. Hey Murthy. How are you? Why are you surprised? It's me, Chandrashekar. Chicago Chandrashekar. Come. Let's go. Come. Please come. Let's go, uncle. Come. Please come in. Stop. Who is he? Why is he coming closer? Murthy, who is he? Tell me? Tell me? Sir, my uncle is not in the position to talk. I will talk to them. Sir, he's Mr. Doddamalayya. The most dignified man of his village. He wants to talk to you. Wait a minute. We want to get freshen up. Murthy, you keep talking to them. We'll be right back. My uncle is in a shock since he's meeting them after many years. He's be fine in sometime. Let's go. What's the matter with Murthy? - Sorry. Sorry for making you wait. - That's alright. Murthy told us everything about you. Murthy has great respect for our family. By the way, but he didn't tell me that you were coming. Murthy told us that you were looking for a guy. - Yes. We give more importance to tradition than money. We too. He's my younger son Nagappa. He's studied 5th grade. My desire is to get him married to your daughter. - Murthy. What kind of a guy you've chosen for my daughter. I didn't expect this from you. Jackie? - Yes, Boss? Send them out. - Okay, Boss. Listen to.. - Just shut up. Get out! Let go. - Idiot, you want hit me? Come on. - Calm down. - Come on. Boss, they are trying to mess with me. Uncle, come here. Come. Let's go. Chandrashekar.. Chandrashekar.. Chandru.. Uncle, wonderful. You acted really well. Who do you think I am? I'm two times gold winner in mono acting. Raam? Yes, aunt. Dear, what's going on? Aunt, you liked Pooja, didn't you? Of course, I liked her very much. That's why we are here. Let's take her along. But these men.. - Laxmi, do not fear. He's been acting ever since his childhood. It is very interesting. Tell me? What's the next scene? Next scene is not yours. Sir, they have few conditions to get their daughter married to your son. What are they? - Since Uncle and I don't agree to the conditions.. ...we refused them. Who are you to refuse? Tell us about the conditions. They didn't like your attire. They said, you look like an agent with it. What? We look like agents? Look, you're getting upset now. Just let that be. How dare they say that? They expect us to dress up like them? We will do it. They have two more conditions. Two more conditions? They were a little upset when they didn't find any woman.. "Present while you were discussing about marriage. I will surely bring them. What is the third condition? Actually.. - Actually? Actually.. - Actually? They want you to cut your plait. Cut my plait? Why should you cut your plait just for 500 cores? I told them it's impossible. Let's find another girl for your son. What do you say, uncle? - You're right. Why do you involve him in this matter? I can always grow plait again.. ...but I can never let go 500 corer dollars. You're right, grandpa. Cut your plait. Okay. I'm ready to cut my plait. Chicago Chandrashekar? His family? I'm unable to recall. But I know them. By the way, what is the name of the disease I'm suffering from? It isn't a disease. Subconscious memory power. Is something wrong with it? - I feel so. If this condition persists" ...you will develop a tendency to commit suicide. You're right. I feel it at times. In that case, you will die for sure. Stop scaring me. What's the remedy? Remedy? - Yes. Blindly believing in things. But if you're in a confused state of mind.. You will develop a tendency to commit suicide. So, you expect n1e to blindly believing in things? You have no other option. In that case, I will blindly believe what you say. Very good. I'm glad. You've changed so much. We just want to meet your expectations. We like your son very much. Let's fix the marriage as soon as possible. By the way, Mr. Doddamalayya.. - Yes? Don't you have brother? Sir, he does have a younger brother. - What? He has a younger brother? - Yes. Having a brother, you came alone to discuss about marriage? Darn it. You've mistaken. Both the brothers are known for their affection on each other. Actually, he's out of town. - Oh. Murthy. - His son is a nice guy. Please try me. - Okay, Murthy. In that case, we will fix the marriage after your returns back. Okay? Darling, let's go. Oh God. You put me in trouble. Why did you tell him that I have a brother? What's wrong in telling the truth? Isn't Chenmallappa responsible for his birth]? Chenmallappa? - Who is he? Your father. Now how will bring my brother? You see that? He's now regretting for going against me. Now Doddamalayya is looking for another girl. Look at his condition. He has become like a helpless snake. Uncle, I think there's something fishy. Shut up. I'm sure he's regretting for going against me. Good evening, everybody. Sorry for the interruption. Collect the valuation of all the things. - Okay, sir. Come on. Hello. Who are you? Hi, Pooja. How are you? Fine, uncle. Hello. - Hey. Who are you? Tm Poornachandrarao. Recovery officer from World Bank. I'm familiar with most of the banks. But I haven't heard of World Bank? It is a most popular bank. By the way, why did you come here? Pooja's father died before he could repay the loan.. ...that he'd taken from our bank. His property in America has already been seized. Still 100 cores are left. She's the surety. Ask her yourself. He's right, uncle. - So, we are here to recover it. She has nothing with her to give away. She's getting married to my uncle's son next week. Very good, sir. - What do you mean? According to the Hindu act.. ...the wife gets 50 percent of her husband's share. We will take that away. Is he right? Sir, that's a rule. My uncle is really unfortunate. Sir, the marriage didn't take place yet. She seems to be a nice girl. Don't delay anymore. Get her married off. We will wait. Not just 1 to 2, it is 100 cores. We will surely recover it. BYE; P00ja. - Bye, uncle. Sir.. Pooja, go inside. Uncle.. - I said go inside. What do I do now? Hey? - Yes? M u rthy? Why did you betray me? - Sir? Why didn't you tell me about Chandrashekar's daughter? Sir, it is not my uncle's fault. He did it so that you retain your daughter-in-law. So, you want me to be at loss? I don't care how. You will talk to Chandrashekar about my son. That's impossible. He has already committed to Doddamalayya. Uncle, don't worry. I have an idea. Chicago Chandrashekar has a younger brother. He will be here to find a guy for his daughter. Younger brother? - Dollars Dinesh. You do know him, right? - I? Sir, you should proceed with this alliance. My uncle will make it happen. Murthy, you're not an ordinary man. Even I realized now. Uncle, tell him about it. About what? - About the conditions. Okay. They have many conditions. Brother! - Brother! I know you're pretending. I know why you're here. You told me about Chicago chandrashekar younger brother. But said his name is Dinesh? You. - I? So, whatever I say will turn out to be true? Haven't you realized it is happening? Everything that you predicted" ...has turned out to be true. Let's go. Come on. Welcome. - Hello. Hello. - He's my younger brother Chikmalla. Hello, sir. He's my younger brother Dollars Dinesh. - Hello. Hi, everyblidY- Mr. M.C. Murthy, how are you? Mr. M.C. Murthy. Look at his stomach. He seems be leading a happy life. He's eating all the time. Let's go inside. Let's go. Didn't I tell you? Your predictions will surely turn out to be true. The characters that I'm creating are coming alive one after the other. It is because of the power you have in you. That means.. I'm God. Ravichandran is the God of love and you're the God of intelligence. Darn it. I never realized I was so intelligent. I've been working in this house like a servant. What do you like doing during your leisure time? I wash dishes, wash clothes, clean bathroom. And then I again wash the dishes and go to bed. You do all this work alone, dear? Yes. This is how it is in America. People do their work themselves. Idiot. How dare you? I will break your leg. Behave yourself. Father, she's acting weird. You have to tolerate her for money. I don't like it. Excuse me. Mr. Chikmalayya. - Who is it? What I heard, is it true? Hello, Mr. Chandradshekhar, how are you? Hello, Raam. Sir, do you know him? He's my family friend. He was the main reason for our world bank to prosper. His food.. - Sir, come have food with us. Oh, thank you. Please, come. That is the reason they say, the world is round. Ra, what made you come here? I had an important work. First tell me what made you come here? We thought of getting our son married to their daughter. Is it true, Mr. Chikkamallya? You said that you'll get your niece married to your son? Listen, mister. We know where to get our daughter married. You keep quiet. - Whatever it is, I don't feel good, sir. First think about your sister's daughter. Let's talk about our children wedding later. How can we marry her all of a sudden? We should find a good groom for her. You can do anything if you really want to. No problem if it is late. We'll wait for you. What will you do waiting? I don't know from where he's come from. They are dancing on his tunes. What is the reason.. - Sir.. Sir, one minute. Please, come with me, sir. Hey, let go. Idiot. Who are you? You're Krishnamurthy, isn't it? Everyone knows that. There's a different Murthy for this world. So, you mean to say is there's another world too. - Shut up. What world are you talking about? This world means nothing to n1e. If I wish, I can event a new world. You can event a new world? Is Tippayya your nephew? His name is not Tippayya, but Raam. Whatever.. what do you know about him? Sir, what do you know about him? The heart is still beating. Come on, cool down. You shouldn't lose hope at this time. What can we do? It was our bad time. You're like a healer to the dying man. What are both of them doing here? Brother-in-law, what are you doing here? Chicago Chandrashekhar is calling you inside. Hello.. don't try to act smart now. I've told your whole story to him. Shut up. just shut up. - Okay. Be careful while talking to him. He's acting smart. Who's calling me? - Chicago Chandrashekhar. Why? Didn't Dollars Dinesh or Laxmi call me? Brother-in-law, what's wrong with you? Brother-in-law? Who's your brother-in-law? Am I the creator? Am I Lord Brahma? I'll kill you right away. Don't kill him now. Let him repent for his sins. I am repenting for his sins. You don't show your face to me. Get lost. If I get angry, I'll bite you. - No. No. What happened to you, brother-in-law? Brother-in-law? Who's brother-in-law? Go to hell. - Brother-in-law? Brother-in-law? Hello.. hello, he left. He left. Go and do your work now. You consoled me like a patient at that time. Now you're consoling me like mourning. Cool down. Cool down, sir. Why are you getting so tensed? There are lots of things to do. Come on, let's go. Hey, you belong to the different world.. ...and I belong to the different world. I'll ruin everyone now. - Big deal. Bye Murthy. - Oh brother Murthy. Bye. Goodbye. We shall leave now. Murthy.. you didn't have food. - I will. Please, go and have food. How is your wife? Give my regards to her. - She's fine. Anything else you want me to tell her? Nothing. Please, go ahead. They are acting as though they know me from ages. To hell with Murthy now. Until we get her married. They'll not fix marriage with our son. Hello, sir. - Thrash this man first. Thrash me later.. forget this alliance now. - Why? Sir, they've kept this condition intentionally. Either of you two get your sister's daughter married to your son. Shut up! If bank people seize all our property.. ...do you expect us to beg for alms standing on the road? Do you want to see that? Shut up! Where's your nephew? Call him here. He's not here. He went to village. Did you hear that? He left to village. How did he leave without informing us? How did he leave? - If he was here.. ...would you get your sister's daughter married to him? What did you say? It slipped from my tongue. Please, forgive me. Sir, I didn't tell it intentionally. Will you kill me now? Murthy.. you're not wrong, but you told right thing. Why cant it be possible as you said? Sir, please don't. his mother was looking for a bride for him.. ...so I sent him to the village. Let us call him back. Does your nephew have property? He's a beggar, sir. He's taken credit from everyone in the village. He'll repay them back. Sir.. - Sir! Hey, are you uncle and nephew playing games with us? Your uncle just said that you went to the village. I was leaving, sir. I thought I would take your blessings before leaving. Is it? Okay. Good. You belong to us now. Now, we've decided that we get our sister's daughter married to you. What do you say? No problem with me, sir. But my uncle will tell you. Remove your hand. Sir, my sister is very orthodox, she wont agree for inter caste marriage. You used to agree for everything earlier.. ...now you're showing attitude to us. Hey, you should agree to whatever we say. Tell me. - Yes. Pooja.. dear Pooja! Come here. - What is it, uncle? We both have decided that we'll get you married to Raam. What do you say? Your wish, uncle. I don't mind if you change my name to Sta. What say? Tell me. Sir, there's a small problem. Like my uncle said, my mother is very orthodox. Our Santosh said that somebody abducted her from the wedding dais.. ...my mother will create a chaos if she knows this. Is that all? - Yes, sir. Call that Santosh here. Sir, greetings. Why are you respecting me so much? Who abducted Ms. Pooja from the wedding dais? Didn't I show you in the photo? Oh God.. sir, why are you hitting me? That's a lie. A lie. - Then? He abducted her. Correct, sir. It was him. It was him who abducted her. Correct. Whoever ask you from now on, tell them the same thing. I'll tell them, sir. - Okay, go. Shall I leave, sir? - Go and do your work. Go. Whatever you say.. Murthy has become our relative from now on. Sorry.. Mr. Murthy I cant understand anything. Even if I've understood it, I am unable to do anything. - Is it? Call me later.. cow is calling me now. Sorry. That's the reason I said, you can do anything if you want to. What do we do? Murthy is our servant.. ...yet he is very honest to us. So.. Sir, if you're so proud about me.. raise my salary by Rs. 500. I don't agree to this marriage. Forget it, sir. If my uncle didn't agree to this marriage.. ...even my mother wont agree. Even I wont feel good to marry like an orphan in their absence. Raam, I can understand your pain. Mr. Murthy.. - Sir.. How will be Raam related to us? Sir, who knows? I've already forgotten all my relationships. I am into the second stage. - Shut up. You're acting too much these days. He'll be like your son, relative. - Correct, sir. Anyways we don't have son. We'll get his wedding arranged. We'll feel happy about our son's wedding. I am relieved now. I shall organize the wedding with grand pomp. Hey Raama! Hey Raama! Hey Raama! Hey Raama! Play the drums! Oh jovial guy! Play the drums! Oh jovial guy! I don't have parents. Who brought me up?

She's calling me from her heart. Dance with joy. Dance with joy. Darn it! Dance with joy. Dance with joy. Narsimha, they said that you were in coma. When did you come back to your senses? Sir, I had to tell you something. Hey! He was the one who abducted Pooja from the wedding hall. Come here.. Is he telling the truth? You told me to tell everyone like that, isn't it? Hey, don't pretend. Hello brother, just a minute. I am coming. Come here. I was waiting for you. - Coming. Relax. Relax. He abducted Pooja, isn't it? Yes. Correct, it is him. Sir, didn't I say as you told me to? Oh, that way.. I am following all your instructions, isn't it? - Yes. Follow? - Yes. What following? Even you're playing a charade. Narsimha, let go off him! Let go off him! What's the matter, sir? He was injured on head. So, he's acting weird. No sir, you don't know the truth. He.. - You were in coma. How would you know what's going on here? I am fine, but still I cant understand what's happening here. I'll kill you. - Narsimha, go from here. Go! You have a seat. Wherever you live.. wherever you're.. Happy sir. Happy sir.. - Stay happy.

But in our house.. no matter how late we eat.. ...they should have food after we are done. Relative, it is very wrong. - Why? Women have a very small world. Husband, house, and children. As husbands it is our duty to talk to them lovingly. Come on, let's go and have food. Wait here.. please, stay here. - What happened? Go and come. Your husband's call. - My husband? Why did he call me? Did you have your food? - Not yet. Why didn't you have food till now? You're already suffering from acimity.. Acimity? What does it mean? - You don't know anything.

Why did you come here? Nothing special, aunt. My aunt has given this necklace for Pooja. She should wear this and sit on the wedding dais. - Okay. Why did you come to give this? You could've given it to someone else. He needs a chance to come here. 'Hey Partha..' - Tell me aunt. Did you give the necklace? - Yes, I did. Okay. Come soon, we have to make you have bath. Okay, aunt. Raam, do you know which wedding hall it is? It is the same where he abducted Pooja. I hope you didn't forget. - How can I forget that place? I was happy in my life, but my problems started from there. Hello. - Father! Mesa (cheat). We've been cheated. What? Mamsa?(mutton) Who'll cook mutton in a wedding? Father, you are not getting me. It is not Chicago Chandrashekhar or Dollars Dinesh. How can they all be there? They are dancing with us. Father, you are not getting me. Hey, how dare you cheat us in our village? Even I'll see how you'll go out from here. I'll kill you! I'll kill you! Aunt, you go to the wedding hall with Pooja. I'll join you there. Narsimha! You go to the wedding hall and reveal this. I'll handle him. Raam didn't return till now. Raam didn't come? - Shut up. - Shut up. I am getting scared. Nothing will happen to him. You be courageous. He'll surely come. You go. - Okay. Brother.. the groom hasn't come yet. I think they've known our drama. Why are you getting tensed? Shut up. Relative.. you seem to be very tensed. Nothing.. the auspicious time is passing by.. ...and the groom hasn't come yet. The groom? - Yes. See there. Play the clarions. Play it. Brother.. don't you think our Pooja looks like our sister. Yes, dear. Listening to someone, we've got her married to someone. Don't know what he has and what not. Why are you worrying? Even, we'll take care of her. We don't lack in anything. - Come. Come, dear. Come. Dear, you don't worry at all. Tell us if Raam troubles you. Just call us. Uncle, you are so nice. If I've hurt you.. - No, dear. Don't think that dear. You can't hurt us. You are our daughter. You are our daughter. Come. Come, let's go. Hey, close the gates! I am going to teach a lesson to everyone today. You can't stay quiet. You've done something again. Hey, give way for me to go. Hey Naga, wait a minute. Come here. What is that? Raam, is Naga telling the truth? Yes. - Why did you do like this? I didn't want to elope with Pooja and marry her. I always wished to marry her and take her from here. Because, everyone is important to Pooja like me. Her parents wished to get her married with your blessings. That's the reason, I did that. Hey! Why are you listening to him.. - Stop! Stop. We are elders, we are talking. Hey, what will you say? What do you think of yourself? Hey! Insolent! How dare you hold my brother's collar? I'll chop off your hand, you idiot. We left the people who cheated us.. We are fighting amongst ourselves. This is not good. Hey.. he didn't cheat us. - Yes. He made us human beings. - Tell them more. We never respected to the words told by our wives. But by respecting the words of the bride.. ...this guy did so many things.. ...see the family members with him. Just see how good people they are. Badra, you are right. Our Pooja is getting married in such good house. We must be very fortunate. What do you say Chikmalla. - You are right. Even we cheated you by getting along with these kids. Please, forgive us. Don't say that. We changed because of you. We changed our style as well as our hearts. What say? - To tell you the truth.. ...we are feeling very bad that you all are leaving. - Yes. So, we all will come and stay in your house for four days. Not only four days, stay in our house for a month. What do you say? - I can't say anything, ask my brother-in-law. New song and music. The old love story. You are very slow. The world is very fast. Be careful when with me. New song and music.
