Thanks for your patience. -It's been a half-hour late.|-It always happens. Every time we fly|out of New York. -We better not miss our connection.|-We only have two hours. -Can I help you?|-I don't know. Can you? -May I help you?|-Why are we behind schedule? Just a few more minutes.|Can I get you something to drink? I don't know.|Can you? Right this way. -Thanks.|-You're welcome. Hi. I'm Jennifer. -Wait till the last minute to pack?|-Nope. Got my first period. Good afternoon, everyone.|This is your captain again. We're making our way out and|we'll take off shortly. Enjoy it. Does it gross you out to know|that I'm bleeding right now? -Why should it? It's just biology.|-We could have sex right now... and I wouldn't get pregnant. -Do you have orgasms?|-That's none of your business! -You're still young. Are you ten?|-12. -Do you live in LA or New York?|-LA. Me too. My dad ran off, so my|mom and I moved to California. -Your parents still together?|-No. Yes! -What's that mean?|-They are getting back together. -That's great.|-Yeah, I have it all planned out. -You're getting them back together?|-I've already talked to my father. And I'm gonna explain to my mother|how the divorce is ruining my life. -Maybe they're not in love anymore.|-You have to work at love... ...if you want it to last forever.|-Who says love should last forever? -They're married!|-They're divorced! They shared vows, made commitment.|They have responsibilities! -Someone needs to remind them!|-My mother says, if love is broken... ...you just have to throw it out.|-That's what's wrong with grown-ups. -They're lazy.|-You're an idiot! -You're an idiot!|-You're ugly! Try breathing. Take a deep breath.|It'll help you relax. I'm not not-relaxed. This is just how I am. One, two, three, four, five... six, seven, eight, nine... Halftime! That's half time, with the Knights|leading the Gophers 14 to 7. It should come as no surprise|that this year's homecoming king.... is the Knights' star quarterback|Cameron Fitzgerald. And what good is a king without|a queen? Let's give a royal cheer... to this year's homecoming queen,|Jennifer Burrows! Bow down to my|queen and king! -Jennifer Burrows?|-Gopher! Do you mock my queen? I thinketh that you do!|And for that you shall die. Die! Die, Gopher! -Run the head over!|-No. No, don't! -Are you all right?|-My head. -You're gonna be okay.|-No, my head. Where is it? How's your head? Not so good. I'm so sorry. You don't remember me, do you? -No. Should l?|-No. We were on a plane|together once. My God! Ryan? You're Counting Ryan? Of course I remember you.|Once a month I remember you. I must have told that period on the|plane story, like, a million times. -Not me.|-You wanna go grab a coffee? What about your boyfriend,|the king? I don't have a boyfriend.|Hate commitments. Why limit yourself when there's|a world of possibilities out there? Maybe all those possibilities|distract you from what you want. -That's why I don't watch cable.|-What? -There's too many choices.|-Luckily your school has uniform. You might have to pick out an outfit,|and with all the choices... you might end up walking|out of your house naked. -That's dumb.|-Yeah, you're pretty dumb. -Don't call me dumb!|-Why not? It's true. You are, you're dumb.|Dumb, dumb, dumb! No. You're dumb! -So you wanna go?|-No! -Why not?|-Because this... us... -We don't click.|-Since when? Since now. Right now!|Does this feel like we're clicking?! I was only talking about|getting a cup of coffee. -Maybe decaf for you.|-It just doesn't make sense to me. -Fine.|-Fine. -What time is it?|-Time for me to leave for the airport. Impossible. I set my alarm exactly|one minute before you had to leave. I set mine three minutes|before, just to be sure. -I love you.|-I love you. -Gopher boy?|-What's wrong? -Nothing.|-It is you. I don't believe it.|Are you going to school here? Yes. -This is Betty. Betty, this is...|-Jennifer. Hi, how are you doing? -Gopher boy and I go way back.|-Please stop calling me that. Okay. Well, I guess I should get going.|It was good seeing you again. -"Gopher boy"?|-It's a long story. Help!|Is somebody there? A little help here, please!|Somebody. Hello? Excuse me.|Hello! -Are you all right?|-I'm fine. -You're Ryan, right?|-Yeah. I'm Hunter, your roomie. -What were you doing in the trunk?|-Right. Well, I got to the room first|here before you... and I thought it would be funny if|I popped out and surprised you. Surprise!|And the rest is history. We haven't even known|each other for 2O seconds... and already we have a story.|This is gonna be great. -So, how are you gonna tell it?|-Tell what? Our story.|I know. You'll say I was gasping for air,|and you saved my life. -Well, l...|-That's a great way to tell it. Chicks love drama.|You're good, man. -Thanks.|-Really good! I'm gonna have a hard time|keeping up with you. Come here. Man! Four years. So is she your|high-school sweetheart? -As a matter of fact, she is.|-Good for you. -Where's she going to school?|-Seattle. -God. Long distance.|-So? -Good luck.|-We don't need luck. We have a strong relationship. We|weren't together over the summer... and everything was fine. -What was she gone? A month?|-Six weeks, two days. You visited back and forth maybe 3|times, called each other every night? -Right. You have to put in the work.|-I've seen it happen a hundred times. Last year, every long-distance|relationship in my dorm... was over by the|second semester. -Just keeping it real.|-Next in line, please. -So where are you living?|-Herman Hall. -I can give you some tips.|-Do you live there? No, but I do have friends there.|I live off-campus with my boyfriend. What?|You have a boyfriend? -Who?|-Michael Winters, he's a musician. -He's great.|-You're living with one guy? You've made a commitment that|prohibits choices in the name of love? Isn't it crazy what falling head|over heels can do to a person? -Next, please.|-That's me. I came as fast as I could.|What happened? -He dumped me!|-Why? -He fell in love with somebody else!|-God. Who? I don't know who and I don't care!|The point is that he dumped me! How did you find out? I mean,|did you catch them or something? -God. In this bed?|-No! God! No, no!|He just told me! -He told you?|-Yeah. We made that whole pact... that if you meet somebody else|you tell the other person. No one ever takes that seriously.|You say it to cover your own ass. I'm really lucky because my boyfriend|is really loyal to his pacts. -How did you find out?|-At the club. -Did he yell it over the music?|-No, no. It was the music. -No!|-Yeah. The same club where we met. It was the same club where we first|decided to move in together. The same stage where he first sang|"Jennifer, This Heart Is Made For 2". And I'm sitting there, watching him,|and thinking how much I love him... and how I can't believe that|I can love somebody that much. And then he sang this brand-new|song, a little something called... Jennifer, Jennifer|You asked me to be true What can I say?|I found someone new That's horrible. Actually,|it was pretty catchy. By the second chorus,|everybody was singing along. -What did you do?|-Nothing. I don't think I've ever felt this way|before. I'm a complete idiot! Why didn't I listen to my instincts,|you know what I mean? Hey, look on the bright side.|Now you get to move in with me. I know things look pretty horrible,|but it's just gonna take some time. -That's what my therapist says.|-To hell with your therapist, Amy. Because I just need|to feel better. Now! "Doo doo be doo" my ass! It's tough out there, man.|You don't know how lucky you are. -Betty and I broke up.|-What? -You're kidding. When?|-A couple of days ago. -Why didn't you tell me?|-I don't know. I guess it's just now|kinda sinking in. This is great news.|Now you and "me" can hit the circuit. -"You and I".|-Right. -I don't think so.|-No, believe me. It's way easier with two of us.|You pretend to be my idiot cousin. All of a sudden, I'm sensitive.|You get drunk, come out too strong... I beat the shit out of you,|I'm masculine. -I don't think I'm ready for that.|-We could trade off. -You can hit me first if you want.|-It was two days ago. -I think I need a little time.|-I'm sorry. You're hurting. -Let's get drunk and see strippers.|-I'm not that hurt! -Please.|-I'm fine. Breaking up was the right thing|to do. We were just... going in different directions. -Hit me.|-No! -Hurry, before she leaves.|-Who? -You know her?|-Kind of. -Okay, then I'll hit you.|-No! -How you been?|-Good. You? Great. -So I see you're all settled in.|-Yes. -Did you get Fridays off?|-Yes. -I got Friday nights off.|-I'm sure you do. -Jennifer, this is Hunter.|-Hi. Well, I'd love to|stick around... but I have to go to the station to|pick up my cousin. He's an idiot. My whole family is, actually.|Me too. Yeah, me too. I'm an idiot.|I'll see you. I got dumped. Music man. Michael.|Dumped me. How's long-distance Betty? -I don't wanna talk about it.|-I just told you about my breakup. -I mean, it couldn't be worse.|-Why do you wanna know? -Misery loves company.|-No, you'll use it against me. Okay, maybe I might have done that|in the past, but I've changed. I have. I'm scarred now and|I look at life very differently. Okay. -You were right.|-The long-distance thing. I knew it. But not for me! I was fine with it.|I would go there, she would come here. If I told her I'd call her a certain|time, no matter where I was... -You would call.|-...l would call! If I told her to call me at a certain|time, I would always be home. I mean, I loved her. None of that|ever seemed like work to me. -But it did to her, right?|-Yeah. This one weekend, I was down there,|we were kissing each other goodbye... and her room-mate came by with her|boyfriend, both carrying laundry. And Betty just started crying. I asked her, "What's wrong?"|She said: We never get to do|our laundry together. She was right. We never did our|laundry together, and that was it. You broke up|because of laundry? -I send mine out.|-Not laundry exactly. Just all the things that couples|do together and should do together. We didn't have the time anymore.|She couldn't handle that. -Why didn't you move there?|-Scholarship. -She could've moved here.|-Scholarship. -So that was it?|-Yeah. -She needed what I couldn't give her.|-No. There's a lot of other things. Too|many differences make it impossible. Michael and I didn't|agree on anything. Ever. That's what I loved about it.|We fought, shouted... had sex... That's what I miss! -That doesn't sound very healthy.|-But what do you know about it? -Excuse me?|-Who are you to judge me? -See? I knew this was a mistake!|-What? I'm just saying that you were|in an unhealthy relationship. It isn't about having to like things|all the time. It's about surprises! Love's exciting and it's thrilling|and it drives you so insane... that you think you're gonna explode!|That's the whole point. Then, I guess Michael|didn't get the point. You've never been to her apartment?|That's some weird shit. No, it's not! She's just being careful. There's no|point introducing me into her world... unless she feels secure in|our relationship. I admire that. What are you doing today? I've got a scuba diving|class at three. Really? No, that's a lie. I lied. I can't stop.|I'm lying about everything! It started so I can impress girls.|And now I can't stop. -You should see someone about that.|-Yeah, I am. -No, you're not!|-See? I can't stop! I can't! Tell you what. The next time|I catch you lying... I'll expose you for|the fraud that you are. -You wouldn't.|-I would. -You're not lying.|-I'm not. -What are you really doing today?|-Dance class. So my therapist keeps telling me|to expand my horizons... but with this guy all I did was|pretend to be someone I wasn't. -And I can't handle it anymore.|-So you're breaking up with him. Yeah, but do you think|I'm being too cowardly? My therapist wants me to take more|responsibility for my emotions... but I just don't think this is the|right time for that, you know? It doesn't matter how you do it.|Phone, fax, e-mail, song... it's all the same message:|"Adios, amigo". Okay, but you have|to be nice about it. Amy, are you breaking up|with your boyfriend, or am I? I wouldn't call him my boyfriend.|I barely know the guy. -So don't worry about it.|-Yeah, but he just seems so sweet. -I don't wanna see him get hurt.|-I know. What are you doing here? I was coming to pick up Amy. Interesting. -What are you doing here?|-I'm Amy's room-mate. -Is she here?|-We need to talk. -We're not right together?!|-I'm telling you what she told me. -You shouldn't take it personally.|-Why do people say that? How can I not take it personally?|It's me she doesn't like! -Okay, fine. Take it personally.|-Why didn't she tell me? -She didn't want to hurt you.|-And you did?! No. I didn't know it was you. I knew it was a Ryan, but I|didn't know it was you, Ryan. -Well, this sucks!|-"Noli nuntium necare". -What?|-Latin. "Don't kill the messenger". You know what?|You're having too much fun with this. I'm trying not to! Try harder! Look, it's not funny. I'm not laughing at you. Chicks|love making us jump through hoops. -This isn't a hoop. We broke up!|-No, it's a test. She's testing you to see|how much you really want her. -You think?|-I know. You've gotta swim across the moat,|bust down the castle door... slay the dragon. No euphemism.|And sweep her off her feet. -You're right!|-Of course I am. You're absolutely right! We were great|together. I even made a chart! -I'm sure you did.|-It proved how perfect we were. Now all I have to do|is prove it to Amy. -What?|-You've gotta do more than that. -You've gotta weep. Openly.|-You should've quit while ahead. Squeeze the lids. Turn on the|sprinklers. You need the tears... of a man who can't breathe another|second without the love of his life. Hold on. I got just the thing. Here. -What's this?|-Icy Balm. A little dab under your eyes,|you'll sob like a miss America. Wish me luck.|Today I learn second position. Ladies! Do you know that they rearranged|all the desks in the library? -No!|-Yeah. It's completely different. I spent 2 hours to find my desk, and|if it wasn't for the Diet Coke stain... I wouldn't have found it at all.|They put it on the third floor. Not the second, not the fourth.|The third. Number three. -And that would be a bad thing?|-Please. It's a disaster! -You wanna hear about the breakup?|-I totally forgot. Was it horrible? -You think we can still be friends?|-I don't know. He seemed shook up. -Poor guy.|-Wanna hear the weird part? -I kinda know him.|-You do? Yeah, we run into each other|once in awhile. Do you think I did the right thing|in having you break up with him? -I don't know.|-I do. It was just putting|too much pressure on me. -Yeah, I can see that.|-But maybe that's what I need. What if that's him? My God, you're crying!|He's crying! Why are you doing this to me?|It's over. Do you understand me? Ryan? Ryan! It's not so bad.|People break up all the time. I can't see! I think I'm blind! Nice patch. -Thanks. You didn't have to wait.|-I'm not waiting. Can't a girl enjoy a lollipop in|front of the Free Health Center? Who also feels maybe|a little bit responsible. You didn't do anything. I didn't put the Icy Balm in your|eye, but I did break up with you. -Remember?|-Yep. -Where are you going?|-For a walk. -Try to forget today ever happened.|-Can I come? What for? Can't a girl enjoy a walk|with her ex-boyfriend? Will the girl continue to refer|to herself in the third person? -Did Ryan Walker just make a joke?|-I don't know. Let me ask him. You know, you're pretty funny|when you're depressed. -Well, get ready for comedy.|-Another one! A few more, I'll take you back to|the clinic to fix your busted gut. -You lost it.|-Not funny? Let's put it this way: anymore|of those, and we'll break again. Come on, this is it!|Round arms! Seven! Eight! -How's it going?|-Get ready! Eleven, ready spiral! How are you doing? Other way. Pull out! Excuse me. Question:|Exactly how far can you bend over? -Do you come here a lot?|-Yeah. -It's really beautiful.|-One of the greatest achievements. You're the second person|to call me that this week. -You know the only way to build it?|-Alien slaves from outer space? Perfect planning.|And doesn't it make so much sense? You examine a situation, you plan|a course of action, you execute it. And everything works out fine. But it doesn't. Well, that's because most things|in life just aren't that simple. Does that look simple to you? You can't imagine how complicated|something like that is to create. -I thought you used it as a metaphor.|-I did. -For a relationship.|-Yes. -Yeah, that's what I thought.|-I mean... I know I didn't know|Amy incredibly well... but it just felt like|everything added up. -Are you a Math major?|-No, Structural Engineering. -I'm done with it.|-Engineering? Relationships. They're just too much.|It's not worth it. "Assentior". -I hear you, brother. Latin.|-What is it with the Latin? -My major.|-Latin? -Yeah.|-Why? -Why not?|-What are you gonna do with it? I'm going to Italy for|my graduate school! And after that? I don't know. See? You're amazing.|I could never do that. -You mean not have a plan?|-Or something. But... then again, why would|you ever need a plan? I'm sure you've always had all you|wanted, whether you knew it or not. You know, that's true. The first time I really wanted|something and went for it... it was Michael.|And it turned out great! I just figured you being a junior,|you'd have it all figured out by now. -That's what you think, huh?|-No, but I'm dumb. Isn't that right? And uptight. And ugly,|if I remember correctly! No, I said all of that|before I was on Prozac. -You're on Prozac?|-I wish. It's a joke. It's okay. I should go. I still have some|more studying to do. Finals. Me too.|I'm gonna stay. All right. -So I'll see you around.|-Yeah. I'm sorry about Amy. It's okay. -Did you get all your classes?|-All but one. -The elusive one.|-Yes. -So did you have a good summer?|-Yeah. -I just went back to LA. You?|-Stayed here. Learned how to butter bagels|for a living. It's surprisingly easy. -You swipe it once back and forth.|-I take mine plain. -Of course you do.|-No regulations for the Internet! -So summer was good?|-Yeah. Everything's good.|It's good. Jennifer, are you okay? I pushed him away. I literally|did everything in my power... ...to make sure that he dumped me!|-Obviously, you didn't like him. No, that's the thing. I thought|it was just a summer fling... but I actually started|to like him! Then why'd you push him away? I don't know. I just... -It's just such a pain in the ass!|-Yes. Yes, it is. What about you?|Did you get any this summer? -Well, l... no.|-You've got the right idea. You know, we should|do this again sometime. Not the whole crying thing,|but, you know... this. Sure. Good. Just another law suit. -Hello. Wanna go do something?|-No! -You haven't heard my proposal.|-It's the beauty of our friendship: I don't need to hear your proposal|to know that my answer is "no". I am the beauty in|our friendship. -I'm hanging up now.|-You can't. -Give me one good reason!|-'Cause... I've rigged an explosive device to|your phone, and your place will blow. Well, I've been|burned before, so... Come on.|I can't study anymore. I'm getting too smart.|People will start shunning me. -Only if you beg me.|-I just did. In Latin. Come on! -You weren't gonna go.|-I was too! -You weren't going!|-Ladies first. Okay. Fine. Why don't I count for you? -Okay.|-All right. One. Two. -Three!|-Three. Here we go. -You know, I can't help you.|-You can help me at the bottom. Do you think I'd look good|with a goatee? No. Wait! This is crazy!|I'm not a natural dancer. -No one in my family is!|-Just move. Have fun! We're here to have fun. You, me|and that pubic hair on your chin. Just follow him and|do what he does! Where are you going?|It's this way, man! -This isn't so bad.|-Good! Come here. You've never been|with a woman before? I've lived with the monks my|whole life. Until yesterday. I walked into the monsignor's office,|turned in my rosary beads and collar... got my deposit back,|and now here I am... playing this strange game|of sticks and balls. -It's called pool.|-Pool. -I have so much to learn.|-I'll teach you. Here. Okay. No, put your... -Don't hurt him! He's a priest!|-I'm a priest! How would you like to have a religious|experience with that cue stick? Please. Run, father, run! So, do you wanna|come up and dry off? -I don't know. Is Amy there?|-Probably. -No, I think I'm just gonna go home.|-Gotta write in your diary? -Something like that.|-Okay. As much as I hate|to admit this... ...l had fun tonight.|-Me too. It was good, clean fun. Maybe we could go there once|a week and do our laundry. It's cheaper than the place|I take mine to. More alcohol. What's up? -Did you kids go swimming?|-Yeah. That's great.|So what's going on now? Because my plans|kinda fell through. I invited Ryan up,|but he's going home to bed. Really? -I'm tired!|-He's tired. Yeah. I'm kinda... tired myself. Actually, we should|get outta here. Good night. You coming? I gotta hand it to you, man.|Very cool back there. -Are you okay?|-Yeah, I'm fine. She begs you to come up, and you|hold back. She's going nuts right now. -I don't think so.|-Did you hear how she said "bed"? -You can almost smell the linens!|-You're way off on this one. -No, I don't think so.|-Are you in a hurry? -No. Why do you ask?|-That's him! Get him! Come on! -Let's go!|-Better start praying, father! -Who the hell was that?|-I have no idea. Listen, best thing for you to do|is just forget it ever happened. -Forgotten yet?|-No! -How about now?|-Man, no. Jeez, you're like an elephant. Great. You're just|in time for cookies! -They look good.|-No. Not those. I thought it 'd be nice to have|a snack when you got home... but I didn't know when that 'd be, so I|guessed and made a batch around 8... but they burnt. So I did another one|around 9:3O, and then they burnt. So I waited a little longer before|the third batch, and now you're home. It's perfect. They'll be ready|in about two minutes. -Why are you wet?|-Ryan and I went dancing. -Are you in love with him?|-What? -Are you?|-No. -I don't believe you.|-What? We're just friends. -Yeah, but he's in love with you.|-Actually, no. I don't think so. Then what do you do all the time|that you're together? I don't know. We do stuff.|We talk about stuff. -Why? You have me for that.|-It's nice to have a guy's opinion. About who has the best pizza|and who has the best tits? Gino's Pizzeria, Susan Sarandon.|Why are you acting so weird? You're the one who's acting weird.|You're the one spending... all your time with a guy that|you're not even interested in. My therapist thinks that|you may have some issues. -You're talking to her about me?|-Of course I am. I worry about you. Listen, if you ever|need to talk, I'm here. -I left her number on your pillow.|-Whose? My therapist's.|Good night. See that guy there? He's the kind|of guy who walks with his feet... if you know what I'm saying. -Come on, you do it.|-Okay. -She likes crackers in her soup.|-No. -What do you mean, no?|-That's wrong. -No, it's not!|-Yes, it is. -Why?|-It's a judgement. -Some people don't eat crackers.|-Exactly. No, the point is to judge where|there's no judgement to be made. -It's a non-judgmental judgement.|-No, no. That's stupid. No, it's not. It's funny.|I'm laughing. Yeah, 'cause it's stupid! Wanna hear something even more|stupid? I'm going on a date tonight. -Really?|-Do you think I'm nuts? -No, I think it's great.|-Really? -Yeah.|-You should bet back in the saddle. No, I'm the kinda cowboy|that doesn't like to ride. -See? That one's not funny.|-Yeah, I know. Ladies.|How are we doing? Hey, it's beautiful out, huh? No, I'm not good at that kinda thing.|You should call Hunter. After investment banking, I decided|to do something for myself. I sell for ten years. I reached|a point in my life, I said... "I don't wanna do|all the work". Jen! Thank God|you're here, sis! Billy, what's wrong?|Kurt, this is Billy, my brother. -Billy, this is Kurt.|-Nice to meet you, Billy. -I was telling her about my boat.|-There's no time for boats! -Why? What happened?|-It's mother. She's sick! My God.|What happened? -I just told you. She's sick!|-Sick how? Yeah.|Sick how? You know!|Sick like the last time! No, I wasn't there last time.|Explain it to me. There's no time for questions!|Mother is sick. We have to go! Sorry. -Are you insane?|-You were great! "Sick how?"|I felt like such an idiot! Ryan, you were great|in there. Really! Thanks. Thank you. Man! You know, next time I was thinking|about trying it with a limp. Baby steps, Ryan.|Baby steps. -Tonight? No, it's tomorrow night.|-No, they changed it. -Who did? Ryan?|-No. -Well, I can't go.|-Why not? What are you doing? Staying in!|I was planning on staying in. I was gonna give myself a manicure,|a pedicure and do a conditioning. -Can't you do all that this afternoon?|-No, because I have class. I have to talk to my professor|about my paper due on Monday... that I was gonna finish while my|nails were drying and proof later! So that everything would|be done before the party. -Can't you do all that tomorrow?|-No. Tomorrow I'll be rushed and tired,|and I have to get everything done! -I can't believe they changed it!|-It's Friday. You got all weekend. What's that supposed to mean? That's like on Monday|saying you've got all week. Yummy. -What do they want?|-Who? They. The chiquitas. I'm busting my ass trying|to fit into their mold... of what makes an interesting guy.|I cannot figure out what they want. What do you want? I don't know. Get laid. Have fun.|Have someone love me for who I am. And who is that exactly? You're absolutely right. What's|wrong with being from the country? A simple kid raised on fresh eggs and|good values who had to get up... at the crack of dawn every morning|with a dog named Lucky by his side... ...to help his pa with the cattle.|-Hunter... you're not from the country. Jeez, Ryan, what do|you want me to say? "Hi, my name's Steve. I grew up in the|suburbs with two working parents... two sisters and a two-car garage.|I have no real identity... nor do I have a clue what I'm doing|or what I wanna be. Wanna go out?" -Your name is Steve?|-The whole point of college... ...it's where you reinvent yourself.|-It's where you define yourself. -Your name is Steve?!|-Yes. And I'm not so crazy about Steve.|Why would anyone else be? -That's who you are!|-Really? It's just that easy? Then drop the cool guy act and go tell|Jennifer how you really feel about her. What? But you'd better do it quick,|before she leaves with that guy. I don't feel that way|about her. Seeing her with that guy|right now doesn't bother you? No. She goes on dates all the time.|We talk about her dates. -And you're fine with that?|-Yes! -Honestly.|-Yes. Okay, then how come you're|here all by your lonesome, huh? If you're waiting for a girl to do|all the work, you are mistaken. -They don't do things that way.|-Excuse me. Is your name Ryan? -Yeah.|-You're in my Statistics class. Nice. What are the odds? You're Engineering, right?|I'm Electrical. Not me. My major. Can you believe how much work|they give us? But I like it... because many people float like|negative ions with no place to go. I'm a laser. I know what I|want and I go straight for it. I feel like there's an armature|spinning in my head. -You wanna sit down?|-Sure. Actually, I was just leaving. -It's because I'm too forward?|-No. Not at all. There's just these two assignments|that I've been putting off. I told my girlfriend that I would|meet her twenty minutes ago. -You have a girlfriend?|-Yes, I do. -Now I feel really so stupid.|-You're not. I really have to go. Hey, sis! -You okay?|-Yeah, I'm great. Thanks, Billy. So I'm gonna take off, then. -Okay.|-See you, bro. -So, how did you get rid of him?|-We fooled around for a while. -Then I said I had an early class.|-Wait. You fooled around? Hold on. When we're talking|about fooling around... are we talking about|fooling around or...? We're talking about...|fooling around. -It's not like we had sex.|-I didn't say that. -Couldn't find a condom.|-You would have?! Yeah. Probably. I have midterms coming up.|I gotta relieve the stress somehow. -That's amazing!|-What? That on any given date the possibility|exists that you'll have sex with a guy. Isn't that the point of dating?|Possibilities? It's not like I know what's gonna|happen in advance. I don't. Sometimes it 'd be a whole lot easier|to have sex than have to sit there... ...and think of something clever to say.|-Okay, granted. I haven't been in that situation|in a long time... but I just can't sleep with|somebody unless I like them. -So you think I'm a slut?|-I didn't say that! -We're just different.|-Yeah, you sleep with no one. -So?|-"So"? Do you know any other single|2O-year-old college guys... who never sleep with anyone?|Who don't even try? -Maybe you're trying too hard.|-Ryan, you don't try at all. I just think that it might be|making things weird between us. What are you talking about? Are we friends?|I mean, am I your friend... or have I just become|your girlfriend substitute? -Are you serious?|-Yeah. It's like, with me in your life,|you never have to try. It's the beauty of our relationship.|You'll just never get hurt again... as long as you pretend|I'm your girlfriend. Yeah. Maybe we shouldn't|hang out anymore. Ryan! I'm so sorry.|I didn't mean that. -Yeah, you did.|-No! I love hanging out with you. You're|my favorite person in the world. -I don't wanna change anything.|-Maybe you're right. No, I'm wrong! You're just waiting|for the right girl to come along... and you don't take sex lightly.|I think that that's a great quality. No, I think I am hiding|behind you or us. -There was this girl at the party...|-A girl girl? You didn't tell me. -I just blew her off!|-Why? I don't know. -I should have given her a chance.|-Yeah. You should have. Well, you still can.|And why not, right? Yeah. Why not? -So, is she cute?|-Yeah, I guess. -Is she cuter than me?|-No! She's thinner. Let me get this straight.|You think that's totally normal? Yes! I have the exact same top.|How come it looks better on her? Because she's anorexic, has fake|boobs and a personal trainer. Are you saying I should|get my boobs done? -Yeah, totally.|-Okay. Come on! -You can't say this ain't fun!|-No, can't l? When's the last time we did this?|Just you and me. It's nice. -Amy, of course it's nice.|-I have an idea. What if you had to, you know, fail|a couple of classes and move back? Would that be so bad? I mean, it's just that Italy's|so incredibly far away! Yeah, that's the beauty of it. What about me? What am I|supposed to do next year? Nothing.|Just like you did this year. Maybe with me gone, you'll get off|your fat ass and have some fun. I don't wanna do nothing without|you. And I don't wanna have fun. -And I have a great ass.|-You do. No, you have a great ass. -What are you doing?|-I'm kissing you. God. I'm so sorry.|I'm sorry. I don't know why I did that.|I just really wanted to kiss you. -My God! I'm such an idiot!|-Amy? Amy, it's... Hey, buddy, watch this. It's like a bridge. It is a bridge. Yeah, you're absolutely right. -Is Katie coming?|-She's gonna meet us at the bar. Really? This is great.|This is great! -She'll experience the new me.|-This ought to be good. No, I'm serious. No more lies.|It's like you said, buddy. I don't need to pretend|for someone else to like me. -That's good!|-What you see is what you get. Hunter unplugged. Don't you mean|Steve unplugged? -So Megan seems nice?|-Yeah, she is. That Paul guy... didn't you go out|with him a couple times before? -Yeah. It's working out.|-Good for you. Jen, Megan here has never been|to the automotive museum. Imagine that. Did you read how the zoo animals|tried to reorganize their cages... in alphabetical order? Apparently|the aardvarks started it. That's right.|But the zebras vetoed it. -Yeah. How did you know?|-I don't know. -I don't get it.|-Me neither. So, Katie, how are|you liking Berkeley? -It's a bit overwhelming, you know?|-Katie's a double major here. -I don't know how she does it.|-How do you do it? I can barely juggle|napping and sleeping. This may sound weird, but I spend|a lot of time with the elderly. -That doesn't sound weird.|-It sounds a little weird. When you're sitting with someone|who's been through two wars... marriages, kids, grandkids,|money problems and disease... getting a B on a Biology exam|just doesn't seem like a big deal. I think we should do|what the Eskimos do: kick the old people out of the igloos,|leave them for polar bears and storms. The minute they can't go on the|big hunt, you gotta get rid of them. I mean, otherwise they'll|just suck us dry. Bastards. -You're kidding, right?|-No, not at all. And take away their driver's|license too while you're at it. What? So you're not allowed to have an|opinion anymore? I did what you said! I wasn't just agreeing for|the sake of it, I wasn't just... making things up so it would look|like we had something in common. I did what you said.|I was being honest. Yeah, but you don't have to say|everything that comes in your head! So now I'm being too honest?|I don't know what you want from me. I don't know what|anyone wants from me. So, what happened? The whole beauty of Paul is that|he was never going to settle down. Then he fell in love with me. Nothing|worse than a bad boy gone soft. -Don't I know it?|-He stopped drinking, taking drugs. -He even stopped cheating on me.|-No wonder you dumped him. It just wasn't working out,|you know? -What's up with what's her name?|-Megan. -Whatever.|-It's okay. -That's it?|-What am I supposed to say? Well, do you like her?|Is she the one? I don't know.|I'm working on it. -You're the one who wanted to go.|-I thought I would feel better. -And?|-I don't know. -It's such a lot of bullshit!|-Bullshit? Show me a movie that takes place|6 months after they get together... ...when everything falls apart.|-Jennifer... It's just that I don't think that|any of us know who we really are. So how are we supposed|to know who Mr. Right is? How do you know he's Mr. Right?|Is it because you wear black... drink cappuccino,|you both have tattoos? Who here has ever|been dumped? And who here has|dumped someone? We've all been in love. But we|never know that it's not true love... until it's over.|What if there's no "one"? Or "two", or "three",|or "four" or "five"? What if there's no such thing|as true love... but we're too afraid to admit it,|so we keep on dressing up? We keep on pretending to be|something that we are not? We keep turning our lives|upside down, losing ourselves... in something that we hope is better|than what we think that we are? What if that something|that we're looking for... just doesn't exist? -Are you okay?|-Yeah, fine. I was just working on|my fear of public speaking. Why does everything|just have to be so... ...just so?|-I don't know. -You're shaking.|-You let me drink all that caffeine. -I don't know what's wrong with me.|-Maybe you're getting your period. Yeah, maybe. Wait a second... No. -Where are you going?|-Class. No, you're staying right here.|Where I can see you. -I really have to go.|-You never go to class. -I know. That's why I have to go.|-Wait. I'll make us breakfast. It's okay. I'm late. I'll see you later. Is this about Megan? No. I'm gonna tell her. Maybe you shouldn't. We'll talk about|this later. Okay? Yeah, okay. Stay as long as you like, and|you know where everything is. Jen! Jen! -I have to talk about what happened.|-Amy, it's okay. No, it's not okay. But it is okay,|because I've been thinking about it... and I think what happened is that|you're my best friend and I love you... and I got jealous when you were|spending so much time with Ryan... and then with you graduating.|And then I think in a weird way... I was trying to keep things the way|they were, and I did that... because I was afraid of losing you.|Isn't that amazing? Yeah, without therapy!|I came up with it on my on. I was thinking about all the time|we spent together, then it hit me: by kissing you, I was trying|to prevent change. But maybe change isn't|always catastrophic. Before we met, I didn't|know you at all, right? -Right.|-That was a change. That was a great change!|I loved that change! Who knows? Maybe I'll kill|myself by midterms next year... but, then again, maybe I won't.|Maybe it'll be okay. That's the beauty of change. You|never know how it will work out. -So everything's okay?|-Yeah, never been better. -You know Ryan's in your bed?|-Yeah. -You know he's naked, right?|-Yeah. -You know I'm curious, right?|-Yeah. So? What happened? I think I was afraid|of losing him. Megan! I'm the one who told him to|start dating, and then he did. I didn't get to see him much, then|the thing with Paul happened... ...and seeing him with Mary...|-Megan. Whatever.|I just wanted to be with him. It was a huge mistake.|Huge, big, fat mistake. We're friends.|We're great as friends. -What are you gonna do about it?|-I have no idea! He takes this so seriously, and the|last thing I wanna do is hurt him. Go to hell, Ryan!|Go to hell! What if I'm in love with her? -Are you?|-I don't know. Maybe. -What does that mean?|-I don't know. I just... don't want things to be|weird with us. Buddy, if you're looking to me|for answers, I'm flattered... but you've come|to the wrong place. If I just pretend nothing happened,|I'll be lying to myself... about feelings|I might be feeling. But if I tell her how I am feeling,|she'll run. That's what she does. I know that better than anyone.|That's the last thing I want. Being yourself, not being yourself.|Welcome to my world. -Does this feel weird to you?|-Yes! -Maybe we should talk about this.|-I think that would be good. Things might get strange between us|because of what happened last night... ...and I don't want that to happen.|-Me neither. 'Cause we're too good together|to let that come between us. -It was a mistake.|-You think so? -Yes.|-I think you're right. I think that we just got carried|away in the moment and... ...you know.|-Yes. Last night was really special to me,|because you're really special to me. But that's all it was.|It was an incredibly special night. I got worried that maybe we'd give|it more importance than we should. No. I'm totally with you. Great. -You didn't tell Megan, did you?|-No, no. -It's probably better not to.|-Yeah. -I feel so much lighter. Do you?|-Yes. -You wanna go fill up on vittles?|-Sure. Actually, I shouldn't. I'd like to,|but I still have some studying to do. -Really?|-Yeah. It's pretty important. -Okay. You call me?|-I will. -Yeah?|-Yeah. This is Ryan.|Leave a message. Hey, it's me. Where have you been?|What's going on? Okay. You know|the number. Bye. -This is Ryan. Leave a message.|-Hey, it's me again. Guess I thought I might catch you|at home. Is everything okay? Would you call me back, please?|All right, bye. Ryan Walker, where the hell|have you been? -Where have you been?|-Studying. What's going on?|How are you? -Good. Busy.|-Yeah, me too. I'm all done. It's "Goodbye,|Berkeley" and "Hello, real world". You wanna go do something? No. You know, I should|really get back to studying. Okay. -So I guess I'll see you around.|-But I'm gone in a few days. Guess you won't have time|to plan my "bon voyage" party. -Yeah. Italy.|-Yeah. -You must be excited.|-You know me. Any excuse not to shave|under my armpits. -I'll be here.|-Yeah? When is your last exam? -Do you wanna go celebrate?|-No, I'm leaving right after it. Okay. I guess we'll talk. -What's going on?|-What? -What? This. What is this?|-I don't know. Nothing's going on. Really? I ran into Megan, and she|told me that you broke up with her. Is that what this is about?|I told you not to tell her anything. Yeah, I know. -Well, are you upset?|-No. -So what's going on?|-I don't know! Things are different! But I thought we|talked about that. I thought that we said that we didn't|want anything to be different. I thought we said that having sex|was just a huge mistake. It was weeks ago now. I thought|we'd go back to being just friends. -Why was it a mistake?|-What? You and me. Why was that|a mistake? I'm curious. We've already talked about it.|You wanna go over it again? No, you wanna talk?|Let's talk! Was it a mistake because anything|like real intimacy freaks you out? Or just that I'm not|good enough for you? Ryan, you kissed me,|and I responded... but I wouldn't have done it if I thought|it was going to end our friendship. And neither would l. Ryan, if I could take|it all back, I would. Take it. It's yours. Put it on the shelf|with all your other one-night stands. Why are you doing this? That night was as much a surprise|to me as it was to you... but being with you is like going|to a place I had never been before! Then, after you fell asleep,|I just laid there, staring up... at those cheap fluorescent stars|you have stuck on your ceiling... and after awhile they just|started forming a pattern... this weird pattern that linked|together our entire relationship. And everything seemed clear to me,|like one logical progression. We're the greatest plan ever made,|and I had nothing to do with it! You made me feel that maybe I didn't|have to keep planning anymore... because it felt like|I was actually living... and that for once I wouldn't have|to work so hard at being happy. That it could just happen. Nothing will ever|hurt me as much... as your reaction|to that same experience. -Ryan...|-What? What? You wanna go to the library and|pretend like nothing happened? I can't do that. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.|I don't know what to say. Look, you don't have|to say anything. I have to go.|Have fun in Italy. -I'm gonna miss you so much!|-I'm gonna miss you too. E-mail me about|anything, okay? You know, school, food,|tall dark handsome Italian guys. -I want to know everything.|-Okay. You gotta stop crying now. Yeah, you stop crying. I'm the one looking down the|barrel of a very lonely final year. Jennifer? Jennifer. -Where are you going?|-Italy. -Right now?|-Miss! -How are Ryan's exams going?|-Good. They're going good. -He's doing okay?|-He's doing great. He couldn't... That's a lie. He's in love with|someone who's not in love with him. -How do you think he is?|-Are we gonna go? I love you. -Hi.|-Hi. -Are you a friend of Jennifer's?|-Yeah. I'm Amy. Amy? Yeah, I've heard of you,|of course. Nice to meet you. And your name? What's your name? My name? Yeah. You know, it's... it's Steve.|My name is Steve. It's nice to meet you, Steve. Going to Europe|for the summer? -Yeah. I just graduated.|-Congratulations. -Thanks.|-In what? -Latin.|-Latin? How interesting. What are you gonna do|with that? I have no idea. Don't worry. I spent four years|at college studying English. -I didn't have a clue.|-Really? Really.|Now I run my own company. You'll figure out|what you want. Why was it a mistake? Was it|because anything that gets close... to real intimacy|freaks you out? -Stop the van!|-What? -Could you please stop the van?|-I can't pull over! -Pull over, I'm getting out!|-I can't. We're in the freeway! Ryan? Nothing will ever|hurt me as much... as your reaction|to that same experience. Am? -What are you doing here?|-I don't know. What's wrong?|What happened? I don't know.|I just... I just can't... Is somebody here? -Yeah.|-Who? It doesn't matter.|Just tell me what's wrong. Amy, who's here? -Hunter?|-Hunter?! -Hunter!|-It's a long story. -Hunter, where's Ryan?|-He's on his way back to LA. -He was catching the 4:OO shuttle.|-4:OO? -Which airline?|-Sky Southwest. Thank you. Hunter? You can call me Tiger. Good afternoon, folks.|Sorry about the delay. We'll be headed out for|the runway in just a minute. -Can I help you, sir?|-I don't know. Can... you bring me a glass|of water, please? I'm sorry, sir. You're gonna|have to wait till we're airborne. It will just be a few minutes. "Te amo." "Te amo", Ryan Walker. -I think she's talking to you.|-Please, you have to take your seat. Did you hear what I said? I love you and I'm not going to Italy.|I'm staying here with you. -It's too late.|-No. Everything that you said|about that night, I felt it too... and it scared me.|I was scared to lose you. But I was even more scared|to let myself love you... because every time I let love in,|somebody takes it away... and it just hurts so bad.|But I'm tired of being afraid. Ma'am, I need you to turn around|and put your seatbelt on. I just made the most important|decision in my entire life... and you want me|to put on the seatbelt? Yes, I do. Okay. What about six months from now?|How do I know you'll be happy then? How do I know you'll be happy?|How do we know anything? -The plane isn't gonna crash?|-We're gonna crash? I'm not asking you again. You're|required to fasten your seatbelts! I need you. That's a really|hard thing for me to accept... but it's a whole lot easier than|imagining my life without you. I wanna do laundry|with you, Ryan. But you send|your laundry out. -Not anymore.|-You wanna switch? Yeah! Will you two please sit down?! -What? What is it?|-The laundry thing is a metaphor? Don't worry.|I'll show you how. -One, two, three, four...|-Try breathing. It'll help relax. ...eight...|-Trust me. That's lovely.|My mother wears the same scent. Looking for something|in particular? I got it. So sorry.|I'm really... Actually, I was in the market|for some cheetah pants. My God. You're all Victoria's|Secret supermodels. -What are you doing in our room?|-All the other rooms were full... and I had to change, so... -This is where we get changed.|-Right. Don't let me stop you! You're funny.|And we love funny guys. Have you ever been|with four women before? Once I had lunch with my mom|and her three sisters... but I don't think that counts. Thank you. What? -No, that's not me! I swear!|-We know. It's us. -Supermodels fart?|-Yes. How do you think|we stay so thin? Does it turn you on? Yeah. -You do it.|-What? Fart? Yeah. -Don't you wanna turn us on?|-Yes. Yes, I do. Okay. Fart. My uncle died this way.|He shot an aneurysm and... Less talk, okay? -More fart.|-More fart, come on. What?|Where are you going? Didn't I turn you on? And there you have it. Every night|for the last week, same dream. So, what do you think|it means? I don't know.|Were you breast-fed as a child? I knew this was a mistake.
