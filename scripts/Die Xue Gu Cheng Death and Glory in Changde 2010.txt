Hefu's long fried fritters. Shuixi's massive tofu. Once at Deshan, turned around. Felt the lotus-filled buns. But I thought had a return ticket. Can't return to the village, Can't see mother and father. Can't return to the village, Can't see mother and father. Tears welling up in my eyes. Wanqing. You see what time is!? You still haven't packed!? Lieutenant. Captain Feng. Wanqing's singing is gets interesting the more she sings. You've married, yet I did not hear about it. Originally, we were going to hold the marriage ceremonies tomorrow. But we didn't want to alert the devils. We were afraid we wouldn't be able to get married. There is always a way. Wait until the Japanese devils are expelled. I will give you two an immense and grand wedding. This is the jade tiger pendant my wife gave me. I'll give this to you as a wedding present. We can't accept this, Lieutenant. Your wife gave it to you as a protective talisman. Take it. Lieutenant Yu. How about I just help you hold it for a time. Okay. You people also retreat. Leave command of the Huben to us. You can rest easy. During the May Battle of West Hebei, Changde was given a false alarm. I'm not fleeing anymore. I want to stay here with Baohua. Lieutenant. Lieutenant, Lake Tujia has opened fire. To Deshan. According to the war zones the Commander determined... Yokoyama Isamu's main force is at our borders. Their troops filed along the Yangtze, their target is clear... To eliminate the troops in the Huadong area. The first wave... Will retaliate for the war at West Hebei... By leading a feint at Changde. Staff Chief Can! Something big has happened, Staff Chief Can! Lieutenant! You! Colonel! We can't retreat! Retreat is desertion! We are here to relieve the 57th Division! Who'd have thought Yu Chengwan is eager to die! Those killed by the devils were our brothers in the 188th Platoon! They were 57th Division! Bullshit! Then we can't retreat! Can't retreat! What the hell!? - Tie him up for me! - Let me go! Retreat! Let me go! Lieutenant! Bastard... I'll shoot you. As men of China, how can you have such weak knees? Get up. Get up! Our enemies are before me, I won't kill you. I'll give you the opportunity to redeem yourself. Thank you for your grace, Lieutenant. Deshan is Changde's defence. Fail to hold Deshan... And Changde will be wide open. Call the brothers to arms. Sis! Sis! Sis! Erhu! Sis, help me sew this on. Come in quick. Sis, you must quickly get away from here. The little devils are almost here. I promised Boss Wei I'd watch the store. Now isn't the time. Everyone's gone already. And here you are valuing money over your life. It's no concern. Just ten to fifteen more days, without a sweat... When that day comes, Sis's dowry will be earned back in full. Sis! Don't move. Quickly get away from here. Erhu! Find out the situation. Report back to me any time. Yes! Chief. Is our Huben insignia a joke to you? Give it back! Give it back! Back off! Give it back! Give it back! Give it back! Chief! Chief. I've begged you. You always leave me behind. I'll tell you Miao crybaby. I'm not a crybaby! I am a Huben soldier. My name is Huang Erhu. I want to join you men in fighting the devils. You're quite loud. Do you know what Huben means? Of course I know. Huben, right? Is all about fighting. Like mighty tigers to a flock of sheep. Good answer. Since you're so eager to fight the devils... Can you fire a gun? Use this one. Okay. You're a soldier, I want you. Really!? Yokoyama Isamu. Born 1886 on Japan's north-east, Fukushima prefecture. Appointed Marshal of the 11th regiment of the Japanese army within a year. His first battle was the May Battle of West Hebei. At the time, troop morale was low. He suffered heavy losses. He has always wanted revenge. We only know this much? Affirmative, Lieutenant. Yu Chengwan, 41 years old. From Guangdong's Taishan. Student at Huangpu for a time. Promoted to Major at age 33. Last month promoted again to Lieutenant. Graduated from Fanyu's local institute, Zhongshan University. Then entered military college as a postgraduate. All-round military man. Marshal. If Divisions 3 and 13 push for Changde together... The Imperial Army will quickly raze Changde. Continue the north-east advance, towards Chongqing. So far... Our little covert operation has not been found out. The Chinese army still thinks we want to attack Hebei. Sir, the Captain calls for you. My buffalo! Give me back my buffalo! My buffalo! Give me back my buffalo! Rice, taste this. Changde is the land of plenty. To the rear of the Chinese army. Yokoyama's strategy is indeed cunning. Using the element of surprise. But he is overly prudent. I fear he might hinder our war machine. With you around, it shouldn't be an issue. Captain, you called for me? Out drawing again? Yes. Captain Itou Once this war is over... You can hold an arts exhibition in Tokyo. Captain. Changde is too beautiful. I've heard that the Utopia poet Tao Yuanming speaks of is right here Utopia The landscape is indeed beautiful. Occupy Changde. Then we'll all play in this Utopia. Okay. Sister Wanqing, time to leave. Where's your luggage? I'm not leaving. I want to stay here with Baohua. Come with us and leave. Don't worry, I've already made the arrangements. You guys get past the city walls quickly. Go now. Go now, go now. Leave already. Take care, Sister Wanqing. It seems his forces are moving and so are ours. Headed towards West Hebei, instead of attacking Changde. Yokoyama Isamu has changed tactics, his main forces will attack Changde. Our eight-thousand against his thirty-thousand strong. You tell me, what can we do? Lieutenant... Defending downhill... Shouldn't be a problem, right? It shouldnt... Although, notify Deng Xianfeng to double his efforts at Deshan. Major. Major. Over here. Major! Report, Major! Colonel Deng! Colonel Deng, he... Speak quickly! What has happened!? He has taken his command and fled! That bastard! Go! Brother. Brother! I am Yu Chengwan. Lieutenant Yu! The devils headed for Deshan have arrived! What? There are about one hundred of us still here! The rest have fled. The devils are hanging us to dry! Lieutenant Yu. Lieutenant Yu! We haven't failed you, have we? We remaining hundred have not failed China! Major Zhao. You have done well. You have all done well. Don't worry! Get your breathing in order and resume fighting. Get down! Get down! Get ready! Gimme. Throw! Get the one carrying the sword! Nurse! nurse! Coming! Doctor! Doctor! My leg! Where is my hand, Doctor!? Apologies, apologies. Wanqing, hurry get out here and help. Where is my leg!? Where is my leg!? Wanqing, hurry get over here and help! Without my leg, I don't want to live! Where is my leg!? How can I live like this!? Quickly reattach my leg. Without my leg... Who will take care of my mother? Wanqing, hold his hand! Hurry up! Our Colonel is dead. Our Colonel, Captain are gone. Our Major, Platoon Commander... Are all gone. Laozou, Xiaoli, Eryang are also dead. How can I live? My leg. My hand. Anyone still alive!? Get up! Get up! Prepare to fight! Anyone still alive!? Check your explosives! Prepare to fight! Are you still breathing or not!? Over here! From the start till now... The Captain rose when the Major died. Platoon Commander rose when the Captain died. Squad Leader rose when the Platoon Commander died. You understand!? Understand. Prepare to fight. Prepare quickly! Spread out! Get up! Get up! Get up! Doctor! Doctor! Any news about Captain Feng Baohua? Anyone from Anyone from the Hefushan warfront? Tell me! Tell me quickly! When it started, I was with Captain Feng. Afterwards, we were scattered. It was terrible. We lost more than half of our Company! We've been had! We've all been had! Yokoyama Isamu, visibily attacked the stone gate, Cili. When he was actually attacking Changde. Quickly relay this to the Marshal. "Changde is under attack from three fronts." "Please lend support." Yes! Staff Sergeant Lee. Add one more message. "Please send reinforcements" Yes! Attacking the city are thirty-thousand Japanese. All are well-equipped elite infantry. We also have elite infantry coming. Just need to hold for ten more days. Hang on until the reinforcements arrive. There shouldn't be a problem. Go. Captain... When will the reinforcements arrive? Why are you in such a hurry? What's the matter? Scared? If the Captain's not scared, I'm not scared. Poison gas. Poison gas! Poison gas! The devils have released poison gas! Poison gas! There's poison gas! What are you blindly shouting for? Those are only smokebombs. Erhu. Erhu. Erhu! What's the matter with you? Last year... My father... My mother... Because of the cancerous Japanese... Were killed by poison gas. Be on high alert! There must be something behind these smokebombs! Bayonets at the ready! Report! Secret order from Chiang Kaishek at Cairo! Changde will fall battle. There must only be victory. Cannot be defeated. But we have already lost Deshan to them. Then we cannot lose Hefushan! At whatever the cost, hold Hefushan. If we again lose Hefushan... Defending Changde will be next to impossible! Stop shooting! Save the ammo! Only shoot when you see the devils. Lieutenant, report! Lieutenant Zhang Lingfu requests your assistance. Lieutenant! Reinforcements from the 150th company came under heavy fire at Taoyuan! Completely annihilated. Lieutenant Xu Guozhang was made a martyr. Major Zhang Tinglin and Major Feng Hongjun have already been killed. One batallion. An entire batallion was lost! Of the men remaining... Fall back to the city walls. We cannot retreat. We will be wide open. Without the outer defense... Changde will be a sitting duck! The many Majors and Captains under my command... How many have died now!? The master is at Cairo. Attending a Chinese/British/American joint summit. Deliberately sent a telegram. Ordering we hold the city of Changde! Or until the city is razed to the ground! You all must already understand! What "at all costs" means! Your plan to lure the enemy away from base has worked, sir. Changde is now a sitting duck. Marshal sir. We can report back to headquarters now... "The Great Japanese Imperial Army have reached the city walls." The capture of Changde should happen any day now. The rice cakes of Changde are fragrant and sweet. Marshal sir. Please bear with me. The nights at Changde are very cold. To a quick capture of Changde, cheers. Cheers. Report. Intercepted Chinese communications. Read it. Yes! By order of Chiang Kaishek... Defend Changde and USSR's Stalingrad both. For the glory of the nation and its people. To all able reinforcements... It will be a sure struggle to victory. Sis! Sis! It's Erhu! Sis. Erhu. Sis, you havent left yet? The devils will attack with poison... Keep your eyes open. Sis, I've avenged our parents. Killed who knows how many devils. You fire without opening your eyes. After killing all them devils... You rushed straight back here to Duoduo? You're saying I cant? I am a soldier of Huben now. Like a tiger, attacking forward. Sis. I have real men now. I'll leave this hunting rifle for you. Your Sis doesn't know how to use it. This hunting rifle was left by Father. I will help you take it then. Sis. We're currently defending the East Gate. You must go. Sis, go back inside. You be careful. Erhu! What are you doing!? You can't take this down. Wait wait! Without this door, what am I to do about the things inside!? Erhu! Over here, bring him over here. Hurry up. Sis, hurry up and give us a hand! Coming. Hurry. Go. Doctor! Doctor! Doctor! Careful. Doctor! Come, put him over here. Watch the steps, put him over here.

Quite alright, dont worry. Erhu. Erhu. Erhu, wait a second. I have a favour to ask... Help me give this to Captain Feng. Tell him it will keep him safe. Captain. For you. Captain. You must promise me something. That reminds me. We're short on ammo. So use it wisely. Remember. If you want to hit something, get the devil's head honcho. Captain. Promise me something. After we've won the war, ask tell the chief... To give me a real insignia. Not a problem, I'll keep it in mind. Get down! A send message to Chief Sun... Press him again on when the reinforcements arrive. Doesn't matter how they get to Changde. As long as they arrive, we'll be saved. Lieutenant. cannot push forward. Forced to retreat south-west of the Qijia River region. Other roads out blocked by enemy reinforcements. Their advances have reached Changde's outer defences. Held them for ten minutes with immense difficulty. We will match them in difficulty! Although the fire hasn't reached our arses, who isn't worried!? Lieutenant! Lieutenant. There are too many dead or wounded. Artillery are all used up. Bullets are also short. All that's left are light weapons. We cannot hold for much longer. Telegram! on the 26th! Come. Lieutenant? You stay here. Go! Endure it! Brothers, lend me cover fire! You! And you! And you lot, come with me! Hurry! Hurry! Lieutenant! Brothers! Reinforcements will be here any minute now! Everyone fight tooth and nail to hold this position! Brothers! Give me a fierce fight! Lieutenant. This has been the devil's 8th wave. Okay, we've fought well. What is the situation regarding our dead and wounded? One platoon... And we can probably count 180th's. Lieutenant, don't worry. As long as we draw breath. We will fight the devils to the end. Here. Marshal sir. The Chinese soldiers are too savage. Use poison gas to deal with them. Wait right there! You've seen the Imperial Army's dead and wounded yourself! You are the Marshal! You must face the Emperor and take responsibility! Face the great Japanese Empire and take responsibility! Face the soldiers who've followed you and take responsibility! What is wrong with using poison gas to achieve victory!? You doubt the ability of the Imperial Army? I've lost confidence in you! You, Yokoyama Isamu, have lost confidence in yourself! For them... You will do away with the Great Japanese Empire's bushido spirit? Destroy Huangpu's morale. Annihilate the Chinese Army's will to fight! From now on... Your Company... Will face the enemy's advancing attack. You will show your loyalty to the Emperor and the Empire. Your lives belong to me now. Your lives are forfeit. Advance! Advance! Fight! Advance! Advance! Lieutenant. What is the situation? entered Changde's southern garrison. But are also under heavy attack from the Imperial's 3rd Batallion. They can't enter the city. We've lost direct contact with them. Bastards. The quality of tobacco nowadays is getting crappier. The flavour is not strong enough! Doctor! Quickly Doctor! Brother! Any news about Captain Feng Baohua? Brother! Do you have any news about Captain Feng Baohua? Gauze. Brother! Any news... About Captain Feng Baohua? Is he still alive? I just recently saw Captain Feng. He and Erhu are at the east gate. He is still alive. Alive. Tao'er! Tao'er! I've asked already. Erhu and Captain Feng are still alive and at the east gate. Thank Heaven and Earth! The Gods have protected them! Still alive. Don't worry. My brothers. Reinforcements will be at Changde shortly. Everyone just hold on. We must hold on. Our bitterness... Will soon be over, okay? Must persist. Just hold on. It's piss. We were out of water ages ago. We are here with no food or water. Because they denied food and water... It is destroying us. Lieutenant Yu, this way. Be careful. Go. Put this on. Where's Wanqing? She asked me to look for her. Go and ask the ladies outside. Have you seen Wanqing? Chen Wanqing. You are Captain Feng? She's gone home already. Wanted you to back and look for her. Thank you. Afterwards... If you bear a son... Name him... Feng Side... To commemorate Changde. If you bear a daughter... Name her Feng Sihua. Since her father was called Baohua. Whatever happens... Whatever happens, I'll... Promise me... You will return alive. How many brothers are still alive? Give me a number! One. Two. Three. Four. Five. Six. Seven. Eight. The Imperial Army's dead and wounded are numerous. Marshal sir. Please approve the use of poison gas. Let the Chinese Army see monsters. As soldiers, we want a righteous victory over our enemies. I want to destroy their will. We cannot use poison gas to kill them. The Imperial Army's thirty thousand troops are not here for some little Changde. Marshal sir. What do you speak for the Imperial Army? Report! Chinese troops at Feng County, Shimen, Cili, Huangshi, Taoyuan. Are attacking fiercely. Our armies are outflanked by the Chinese. What are you afraid of? Marshal sir. Delay the war machine. And the military courts will not leave us alone. Report! Telegram from the Emperor. To capture Changde in two days. Otherwise, all are to commit seppuku. Hurry and enter the battlefield! Prepare to fire! Erhu! Captain! Captain! I'm fine! Hurry! The devils have released the poison gas. Hurry! Poison gas! Draw urine! Send a message. Tell the Field Marshal. "Friendlies not in sight." "No signs of reinforcements." "Japanese army have breached the city walls." "My army is launching a counterattack." Yes! How many brothers are left? Altogether no more than three hundred. Marshal sir. Call for a reporter immediately. Let Tokyo and the whole world know. The Imperial Army has seized Changde. Then where is Yu Chengwan? The Chinese still resist us. Not one person is surrendering. Yu Chengwan has not yet acknowledged defeat. Keep order. I've told you already. If they've entered the city then we have methods for dealing with that. Retake Xiangzai. We must match the Japanese in strength. Yes! Don't bother looking for reinforcements now. Lieutenant. Only separated by a river, almost within arms reach. Yet they still have noone willing to aid us. We mustn't lose hope. Lieutenant. The whole Division placed their faith in you. Battle is imminent. How much military might have we got now? Sixteen armies. Around forty divisions. Totalling two hundred and ten thousand men. Only forty divisions... Means that there is noone to save 57th. I really want to ask the leader. Maybe "to think of a different strategy"? No matter what you say. Our remaining armies are trying to hold off the sieges laid. They already planned sticking To keep Yokoyama Isamu firmly at Changde. Even so... Our eight hundred Huben soldiers... Holding for more than ten days now... Have defended it valiantly. Wounded soldiers at Siyanjing. Come tend them! Quickly! Captain. Captain. Sister Wanqing. Let me leave. Stay here and look after Captain Feng. Erhu, take care of Captain Feng. I'm leaving first. So the fight has even reached Siyanjing. Captain, get better soon. I'll go over there first. Be careful. Sis! Sis! Sis! Sis! Sis! Sis. Sis. Baohua... Erhu. Over here! Just wait a minute! Captain! Captain! Any survivors!? Are there any survivors? Are there any survivors!? The Captain dies, the Platoon Commander takes charge! The Platoon Commander dies, the Squad Leader takes charge! Then everybody listen to my command. Check your ammunition. Prepare for battle! "To the remaining officers and civilians inside Changde." "You are advised to refrain from unnecessary bloodshed." "You have three days to relinquish your weapons." "Cooperate with the Imperial Army." "And pledge allegiance to the Japanese Emperor." "Or Changde will be burned to the ground." "And you all will face death." "Yu received his education at the military college at Huangpu." "He knows only to win or die trying." "The entire Division will share in his resolve." Send this out to all the soldiers. Yes! Today, I want you all to bear witness. To the Great Imperial Army's greatest moment, the capture of Changde. Fucking devil. Wait a second. You fucking devils! Die! Stand back. We must hold Changde for one more day! Then the Japanese will not be able to take it! Yokoyama Isamu at the moment has not made any actions! Beat him... Not only him but the entire Japanese army will be humiliated! Yu Chengwan wants to stand in our capture of Changde. We want to as quickly as possible... Pin down Yokoyama Isamu's forces. So he can no longer retreat. His objective is to overcome our siege. Report! The Chinese's 18th have crossed the Yanghe River. Clashed with our 39th Batallion's defensive line. Chief Ishi's emergency. Our retreat may quickly be cut off. Acknowledged. Yes! Tell Yu Chengwan. He doesn't have to surrender. He has until noon tomorrow... To show himself outside the city walls. Yes! What the hell are you doing!? Does the General no longer want revenge? Our retreats lines are quickly dissapearing. We're on the chopping block. You still don't understand? Execute the order. Lieutenant. This is a great opportunity. Breach the siege, join with reinforcements then fight back on the other side. We're all still alive... Nonsense! You can talk? Lieutenant. We have the Japanese army pinned down at Changde. Their siege is almost complete! I say again! What shame is there in breaking out to risk life and limb to kill the enemy!? The order was to die with the city! Disobeying an order is a capital offence! Lieutenant. Stick with Changde and wait for reinforcements? Of course, our reputation is at stake, but... Lieutenant. "Qionghua, my love." "Out of ammunition, no reinforcements and men dying." "The city walls broken." "I, Yu, am determined to give my life for the nation." "To annihilate these invaders." "Hope you'll remember me always." "In the words of Wen Tianxiang." "All men die eventually." "But we leave in history with the hopes that others may learn from it." "After I've made my decision." "I stand before the committee." "To be remembered in the hall of heroes." "My dear wife, whatever happens." "Unless the invaders leave." "I will not leave Changde with my life." "If killed in battle." "May I be buried in Changde." "Please don't be too sad." "Yours sincerely." "Chengwan, signing off."
