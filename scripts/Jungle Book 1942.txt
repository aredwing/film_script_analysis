But Leopard lays by the law of claws and horns and fang, he will kill for hunger, and eat there all, but he'll never kill for killing sake, a law that all men break but jungle folks obey These are the lords of the jungle, tribe of Hati, the Silent ones, they go their way, eaters of grass in a world of carnage But the Wolfs are the true hunters of the jungle and likes hunt while stick to their clan with a strict regard for hunting calls and tribal law three companion of the woods, they may fight and quarrel among their selfs and the strongest wolf must take the leadership Yet jungle folks says that the wisest among them is the tribe of Balu the bear He is a teacher of the jungle law Yet there is one who knows no law the barrel border mudguard, the Crocodile with his chin in his shallows and lust in his cold hearth hopping to drag dawn to the deeps all who wonder in his river banks And in the legends of the jungle there is a black creeps shredders to the law of claw, horn and fang disposers of buffalos, as reckless and wounded elephants but the voice is soft as wild honey dripping from the tree and prier and master and afraid Bagheera, the black panther And now behold the villain of my tale the killer, the man killer, the assassin over spread murderous through the jungle clans Shere Khan, the Tiger It is said that when the first kill when he was king of a poor able of the glades when he run from the scene of his first crime the trees and creepers whip him with their branches and straight his yellow eye with the mark of Cain This evil law they must have it's dislikers, his bullies pretenders, Tabaqui, the jackal and the hyena, hungry for the scraps of the murderers masters feast But my tale is not alone about outcast and heroes I will tell you also of rock snake Kha, the wise one the Oracle who thought mother Eve's speech menus for treachery and sin What is the book of life itself but men bows at nature, the struggle between village and jungle under the mantle of wild creepers and great trees many ruin cities lays forgotten in the pages of time where a thousand war chariots proclaim the might emigrated king before whom all men bow their heads nothing remains but a tradice for wild flicks some apart But what of the great Maharaja the loser in this battles he has left many such palaces to his cousins the monkey pack, the bender logs, the outcast of the jungle You must picture who I was, Milords Buldeo, the mighty hunter Was a long time ago and very far away, on a summer evening in the Sioni hills come closer, come closer Gems on the leather, Buldeo's message that fool makes speeches the all day.
