I think the older kid has been teasing you, sweety. I broke her window. Her window? If you threw a rock at the house, and break one of her window, the wicked will get you. So, you and Jenny went out with the older kids? You were supposed to stay at her house. It was just for a bit. Her sister had a car and we drove. And I didn't know it that far. I'm sorry, Mommy. Well, I remembered a story of the wicked from when I was a little girl. And I can tell you, we searched and searched that old house in the woods... And it was never a witch to be found. It was just a silly story to frighten little kids. Here. Now, I have to go concentrate on work. I have a big case tomorrow. So you, go to sleep. Mommy, help me! Mommy! Mommy! Amanda, that's enough.

(correct pronunciation) So Jake, you enjoy your last day at the mother nature? You know you're missing Spring Equinox Festival. Yeah, but you know me, Bob. I'm not so good with people. The town is buzzing about that missing Drake kid. Her mother claimed she was taken right from a window. You know what that means? You know, if they just tear down that stupid house, this whole witch legend, will die with it. Yeah, tell me about it. The police think the estranged father took her for the weekend.

I care, I just don't use it as a crutch. Fuck you! You're supposed to stay home! That little bitch told you, didn't she? Hey, let me tell you something. You say anything to anybody, and I'll post that picture that I get you jacking off in the bathroom. All over the internet. What picture? Are you not in the bathroom a couple nights ago, just... whacking it? Like you don't do it. Yeah, it's better than you do. Just inbreds like you with no friends. Pretty worth of it, it's all on Facebook. Okay? I wish it was you that died! Likewise. Likewise. Where'd you up to? Just coming home frome my shrink. She said you can be a real asshole sometimes. I A shrink said that? Yup. She's right. It doesn't matter. We have plans tonight. Take your camera. I wanna blackmail his ass. Excellent. My mom's been drunk since this morning. So she won't even know. We'll grab some sleeping bags. We camp. Unless you're scared . / Scared of what? Hey, Samantha, how is it going? Hey, Carl. Come here. Roy Harlan said he saw you swiped a cigarette from his shop yesterday. It wasn't me. I don't smoke. Other kids just got it somehow, right? Leave her alone. Shut your smelly dickhole! Your mother's a drunk. And nobody knows who your father is. You know what that means, right? It means when I finally nail your ass, they're gonna ship you out to a foster home just as far away from here as they can. We haven't forgotten about all those prank phone calls, shitsmirk. Paybacks are coming. Trust me. You consider mouthwash, Carl? I don't know what smells worse, your breath or your ass. I'm sorry about your grandpa. I liked him. He didn't like you. I got a picture you're smoking dope while on duty. That'll got you fired you know. That's bullshit. Isn't. See you around, fuckers. Mahoney! Button up your shirt. God, he's so weird. Let's get outta here. Damn, nice house. You thought I was kidding? Crazy. Sweet. I mean this just... just like Bruce Wayne mansion. I For real. Hopefully she shows us the "bat cave". Really? Grow up. She's gorgeous and loaded. Lucky ass. Hey, how are you? Good. / It's good to see you. Zack, you know Julie, right? Uh, we're in trigon. Are we? I should tell you. Hey, what's up? Thanks for inviting me. Yeah, anything, just sure then. Dude, her eyes are green. All right. Come on, we gotta sort shit up. / Whatever. Hey, hey, wanna switch girlfriend? I told you. Come on. Well, speak of the devil. So, what's this "Open Hearth" thing anyway? I Oh, it's the name of the witch's house. Witch? Yeah, it's used to be thruth and dare. The trick was you had to get close enough to throw a rock at the house. If you hit the house without breaking any windows, then you would safe. And if you break a window? Then the wicked will get you. It's just bullshit, right? You know legend has it, that the witch and her cavern were burnt by with hunter back in the day... like, you know, a hundred years ago or something. Ladine Lorene. Yeah, that's right. Ladine Lorine. She survived. You wanna know how? Yeah. She eats kids. Yeah, she eats kids. She tears the limbs off. One by one. She start with their feet. And then she rips off their legs. And she rips off their arms. And she eats every part of the body. And she eats the little ones, you know, to keep her young. She eats the older ones to keep her strong. Then she eats the pretty ones, just like you... to keep her beautiful. That's ridiculous. "Season of the equinox the witch... " uh... "Besets her kill. ". Terima kasih. "One less soul the town to know"... "Taken against their will". Nice! It is time. Let's go. But, why doesn't it feel like a tradition? I mean, why we're the only ones doing it? Well, apparently 15 years ago some kid broke her window, and was never heard from again. Yeah, except he ran away to Florida or something. Dude, that's just what the cops want people to believe. Okay? What about those kids who were hiking from long way? What, 4 years ago? Right? No one found them. Yeah, well. They did searched the entire house. It was abandoned. So... That's all part of her magic. Come on, man. Do you really believe that? Listen, all I'm saying is, there is a reason that we should stop doing this. Whatever. Let's go. Road trip! Hey, what are you doing? Taking a picture. I'm just gonna put it on Facebook. Are you retarded? I'm not supposed to be up here! Stop it, okay? Don't post anything. I have a class to show up. Oh, this is so freaking sad. She's just like my little sister. I heard that she ran up with a bunch of kid, and someone hit the window. You're freaking me out. The cops went to checked it out, it was empty. Oh, don't listen to him. That house has freaking awsome mirrors. Oh my God, the creepiest thing, whenever we tried to get back, those windows are fixed. Have you ever done it? Oh, yeah. We were 12. Zack backed out. I had excuses! Holy shit. I forgot that one. Show her your hand. Come on, don't be embarrassed about. Just show her. I wanna see it. Why is that? Well, my grandpa crashing the bowling ball trying to do some magic trick. I became his favorite prop all over the show. Great grandfather. Yeah. Right. Sammy? Sammy! Sammy! How much further? I think it's just ahead of us. You mean we're lost? We're not lost. We're in the middle of nowhere. You scared, aren't you? Come on. Come on. You wanna race? Come on. Speeder Point. Here it is. What do you think? There is no road from here to Open Hearth. So... Let's hike. It's just a few miles, right? You wanna hike tonight? Yeah, what are you, nervous? No. I just got the things in the dark I'd rather do. Oh, man. Check this out. Wow. Beautiful. I have probation. Probation. Are you sure? Yeah. I think that's cool. What's cool? I like a guy who doesn't fall for peer pressure. Just character. Or, you're being a total score. Come on. Try some. Ladies. Don't run away. So, what's up? So, are you gonna sleep in the same tent? You're telling secrets already? Oh, my God. Okay, watch. That was good. Yeah, my grandpa was great at it. Everybody was given out silver dires in Christmas. You still have one. Yeah. He was really cool. Do you really think there is anything after we die? It has to be. You don't? Biological. It's like... Everything else. And when we die... we just... Just vapor. Energy. Just like this flame. And do you think trees are gonna have it? Only if they're good. Otherwise, they're right to the chipper. I'm sorry. I thought you were lesbian. Shut up. Have you ever done it? Done it, done it? No. Have you? No. Just the pine cone, all right? You're scared of everything, aren't you? Aren't we supposed to be friends? So? I just don't wanna go all the way, for now. Okay. For now. I'm not a lesbian. You're kidding. Open Hearth. Did you hear that? Hear what? That's what I mean. Quiet. All the bugs. All right. Let's get this over with. I wanna go back. Oh, someone's scared. I'm fucking scared shitless. I don't... Just take it. I don't want it. Come on, Tracy. We're all on this together. I I don't want to. You did not drive me here for nothing, did you? I Yes. Okay, ready? Count it down. Okay. One, two, three! Oh, shit! Whose rock is that? We'll know soon enough. There's nothing to worry about. What? What the fuck! Guys! Guys! Guys, it was just the shadow of a tree. Yes, it was. Dude, I was pissed my pants. Jesus! Can we just go? I think we probably should. I think you're the one who broke the window. Damn it, you're a dick, Carter! We got a LOL. Ready? Yeah. Okay. Here we go. We're getting closer. Why do you say that? Do you think anyone actually died there? That's witch's stake. They burned her there. Oh my God. They're gonna hear us. Good. Well, it must've been hard moving so far before graduation. Yeah, that is a thought. Well, you could improve those here. So, hey. Why did you get kicked out of school? And you don't have to answer that. So you heard all those rumors. Some of them, yes. You wanna know what my big secret is? Because nobody knowing out what happened. But you have to promise to keep it between us. 'Cause it's kinda embarrassing. Okay. My big secret is... that I don't have one. I would, I just moved. I mean... the same thing that happened since 8th grade when my dad got reassigning. / Seriously? Of course. You didn't sleep with your English teacher? And I don't do coke, and then punch my friend in the face. I can't even remember the other one. Wow, how boring. It is, isn't it? But, life is cute, isn't it, 'cause you joined the cold status. Yeaah! Oh God! Oh God! Oh God... That's my boy. It's fun to have it. Don't do that. You're gonna go in. You're gonna go in. Oh yeah? Did you hear that? What? You didn't hear that? It's just umm... It's something else. It's just the wind. That's not the witch, Zack. Do you wanna go swimming? I didn't bring a suite. So... I mean, unless you really think you melt. Julie? Julie! Did I scare you? Not cool. I thought it's pretty funny. No, it's not. Of course not, if we die. It's close, right? Not as scary as everyone says. I think they're here. You're gonna do it? To hit the window? That's the point. Beside, how cool it be to see a witch. You do it. Crap. See? Total gip. It's just the wind. What wind? We have to leave. What's that? Let's go. Oh, shit. Go, go! What's wrong? I thought I heard something. Amanda? Zack! I'm sorry. Look at this. A teddy bear? Yeah. It wasn't here before. / What are you talking about? Carter! Tracy! What the fuck! Wake up! Look at this. Look. It's hers, I just found it. Julie, this could be anybody's. No, that's personalized teddy bear. My little sister has the same one. Pretty funny coincidence, don't you think? I Where did you find it? It was found it over there, but it wasn't there before. Well, obviously you just didn't see it. Or maybe someone came through here with that little girl. Hey, what are you doing? I'm calling the police. Look, I'm screwed if they came by figured that we're up here. Seriously? That little girl is missing, and you worried about getting into a trouble? I had reception area, what the hell. I Look guys, I don't want rumors going around. My parents think that I'm staying at Tanya's. You guys are unbelievable! That little girl could be out there somewhere, so alive. We have to look. / In the middle of the night? Maybe she's right. What, really, lover boy? Or it's just your dick talking? Fuck you. Guys, I don't think it's a good idea to go marching up to the woods. If you are right, that girl's kidnapper could be out here. Fine. Then I go by myself. We're all go. Right? Where is she? I don't know. Take out your camera. Why? To document it, just in case. That's a good idea. You're on? Yeah, yeah. Hurry up, it's gonna die. / Hi, I'm Max Reese at Open Hearth. If you find this, burn that house down. The wicked is real! I broke a window. Then uh... Something came out of the house. Hairstrap from the picture. What was her name again? Amanda. This is creepy. Can we just go? Julie! Go get her! She's your date! Julie, what are you doing? It's empty. / No shit. Let's get outta here. No. That teddy bear didn't just get up there by itself. Someone kidnapped that girl. That's what kidnappers do. Listen you have to call the police. I don't want to get any trouble. Let's just get outta here. Come on. Julie. Did you hear that? No. Well, it sounded like somebody's crying. / No, it didn't. This is all a gag, isn't it? What? Carter placed that teddy bear out there. You guys are just messing with me. Right? Very funny, Julie. You got me. Let's go. Come on. Probably just the pipes. Yeah, the pipes. Julie. We have to pin it and get down there. Zack. Zack, I found it. You go look, Zack. You go look. Seriously? No, no. Okay. I'll go. Just wait here. Where did they go? Maybe they ran inside the house? Oh, shit. I think I heard something upstairs. What? There's something in the house up there. Are you serious? Yes. Carter, look. Hold this. Okay. Somebody's down there. Yes, yeah... Flashlight. Here. Oh my God! It's her. I'll get her hold up. Guess it'll be easy. Good luck. Okay. All right. It's okay. It's okay.

They're trying to get out. Wait, wait. It might not be them. But what if it is? I'm not going near that goddamn house. Fine. I am. Zack! I know! I know! Come on! Wait! We're running in circles. We need a plan. It's her? What about the dude that took her? He'll get coming after us. It's not a him. It's the witch. What? It's not a ghost story, Carter. Right over there is graveyard of camping shit, back down that house. Okay, she was in that cellar wrapped in some cocoon or something. It comes from the camp. Shit, my car! Listen. I'll bring him back. You're gonna stay with her. Keep her safe. Dude, my car is gone. Dude, everything is gone. You're just gonna leave us here? Can we go to the truck, please? There is no truck. Somebody stole it. She wants it. The girl. Are you believing this shit? It's real, Carter. We need to keep going. We need to get outta here. How are we gonna do that, genius? It's 10 miles to the nearest town. What about that Ranger station? I mean, the one we saw on the way down here. I mean, they might have phone or something. That's still 4 miles away. You wanna wait here for the witch to get you? Cause she's coming. Carter, can we just go? All right. Witch or not, whoever took her, it is probably pissed off. So yeah, let's get outta here. Hey, wait a second. What? Well, look! What is that? It's Max's bike. I mean, he must just followed us up here. That little prick took the car! Without the keys, Carter? Max! Max! Shut up, dude. What is it? Look at this. Look at that. He's probably a half way home with shit stain on underwear. What if he were not? I'm gonna back to the house and find him. You could do it on your own. I'm not asking you, Carter. Am I? Zack. You can't go back there. Would you leave your little sister up here? Listen, I can't just do that. Just call the police and get her some help. Fuck it! Okay, can we just slow it down? Yeah, yeah. You do whatever you want. You don't have to be such an ass, okay? She's here. The wicked. Wait a minute. What? What did you say? She's already here. Who? Who's already here? What are you talking about? Shit. Tracy? Julie? Julie? What are you doing, Zack? Calm, they're not here. Let's go back and catch up with the others. She got Max. Where is he, Sammy? She hides him inside. Zack, we've gotta get him... Listen to me. Hey, when we travel back here, there's a county road nineteenth.

You guys absolutely sure there's someone in that house? Yeah. We set her on fire. We trapped her in the cellar. Well, there's no other bodies in that house. There's nothing. That means she got away. No, she didn't get away. I have a 10 mile radius set-up and block around here. If there's anybody out there, she won't get far. Trust me. House and mirrors. Even if the festival continued with a good news, that 7 year old Amanda Drake is recovering... And has been upgraded to fair condition, ...we are hearing that the suspect has still not been found and remains at large. The house where it all took place, of course, has been a piece of local folklore for generations. Bit local kids insisting the legend is true. And that Ladine Lorene... ...Is in fact, a witch. And still very much alive. It seems awhole new generations of children are being frighten into believing, ...that the wicked is just outside their window.
