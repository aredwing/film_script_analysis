That's how y'all doing it in 'Rico? That's how we do it. Voltio. You ever heard of Voltio? He's an amazing reggaeton artist. His music is like a mix of, like, reggae, rap, parranda, merengue. Oh, that's dope, man. Seems like a crazy combination, man. It's like music from the ghetto. You know, it's about our struggle, our dreams. You ever had a dream? Come on, tell me.

Thank you. - How do you know Voltio? - His father and my father... ...went to the same school. - Oh, yeah? They had a band called The Artichokes. So you guys are musicians too? My brother is a rapper from New York. I'm trying to be, you know what I'm saying? But I... - Yo, C.C. - Hey. We gotta talk. Leave me alone. I'm not your girlfriend anymore. - Would you just talk to me? - I can't. Do you wanna come smoke with me? - So you smoke now? - Yes, I do. Hey, my bad about inside, you know what I'm saying? It's okay. - Look, I don't really smoke. - I don't either. - Rob, right? - Yeah. C.C.? - Yeah. - All right. C.C. We are headed to San Juan. Alexis and Fido are playing.

Do you have everything? Yo. Yo. Hurry. Come on, right here. - Hello. - Hello, Rob. Yeah, what's good? - Am I calling you too early? - No, just in time. Can I come over? I need some help with something. Yeah, sure, no problem. - Are you okay? - I'll call you back. Bye. Come on. Yo. What's good, man? What you doing? Making music. Come sit down, I wanna show you something. That's your basic reggaeton beat. Okay. Yo, man, how'd you get all this stuff? I broadcast music online. Oh, that's what's up. This is something I've been working on. Okay. Okay. Slow it down a little bit. Slow it down. No, no, no. The idea is to go the other way. Otherwise you have hip-hop. - Okay. - Yeah. - Okay. Okay. - Keep going. Keep going. Okay. Okay. - Sing. Come on. - Okay. Okay. Your boy Rob. Coming straight out of Harlem. Uptown, baby. Uptown... Okay. Check it out, check it out. Yo, I'm trying to be the Superman of the ghetto. Get this paper, take this music to a whole other level. Trouble found me, then I found myself in Puerto Rico. That's why I got high, I had to roll. - Something like that? - Yeah. - Something like that? - That's off the hook. Oh, yeah. We moved from New York to Puerto Rico when I was 8. Anyway, I came here to talk about personal business. - Oh, personal business? - Yeah. Well, what personal business is that? I actually plan on making it to New York this summer... ...to study dance. I have this application that I need to correct. Can you do it for me? - It's in English. - But your English is perfect. Spoken, not written. It's not a lot. It's just a couple of pages and you can just correct it as you go. Okay. So, what do I get out of this? Why do you have to get something out of it? Well, I mean, usually I charge a fee, but, you know... I can give you my lucky-charm bracelet. - Hey. What's up? - Play this. - Hey, what's up, man? - What is it? - I'm not gonna mess up your date. - Okay. Were you recording? This is you? This is crazy. This is real hot. You guys need to record this. My neighbor has his own studio. I can call him if you want. - That would be dope. - Okay. - All right. - Bye. What have you been up to? - I'm sorry, what did you say? - What have you been up to? Well, nothing. Did you happen to see anyone hanging around the house today? No. Why? Someone stole Marivi's engagement ring. No, I haven't seen anybody around here today. It meant a lot to her. It meant a lot to me too. - Hey, Rosie. - Thank you, C.C. Excuse me. Can I ask you a question? I was wondering... I saw you at the club, and you dance great. - Man, you've got some great moves. - Thank you. Thank you. - What's your name? - C.C. - I'm Jeffrey. Nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you. I was wondering if you'd ever consider taking on, like, private clients. I would have to check. I don't think they allow it. I'd be willing to pay handsomely and make it worth your while. - I'll look into it. - Okay. Will you take a card? - Sure. - Maybe call me? - Okay. - Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you. I'm not feeling it. I don't like it. No. Look, try it like this: - Know what I'm saying? - That's too much hip-hop. What? That's how all the best hip-hop records were made. That's the point. It's not supposed to sound like that. Look, man, just try it. Just check it out. You check it out. Yo, why you being all stubborn for, man? Just try it. Yo, look, man, I'm not trying to battle with you, okay? But if we gonna make music, we gotta make music as a team. How we do music if you wanna do one thing, I wanna do another? - You tell me. - What are you talking about? - I'm doing hip-hop. - We're in Puerto Rico, not New York. We don't do hip-hop, we do reggaeton. I like 50 Cent and Snoop Doggy Dogg. Okay, yeah, and I like Daddy Yankee and what is his name? Pitbull. - That's not the point. - That's not the point. I swear... Yo, you hear that? Yo, you hear that? What...? Yo, what's that? A frog, the coqui. I like that sound, man. Might wanna use that, you know what I'm saying? Like in a song or something. Yeah, yeah. - No, no, no. - What? Okay, okay, okay. Yeah, yeah, yeah. - Hello. Yo. - Are you there? - Rob? - Yeah. - What's good? - Nothing, I just wanted to call you... ...and say thank you for correcting my paper. Thank you. - It's no problem. - I spoke to my friend... ...about using the studio. - I think I can get that for you guys. - Oh, thanks. Appreciate that. I'll get in contact with him and let you guys know, okay? All right. Peace. Talking to her, right? That's her? You talking to her? I'm talking to none of your damn business, that's who. - Not my business? - Yeah. Everything around here is my business, negro pendejo. Say what? Say what? I know where you live. I know where you live. I know where your parents work, you'll see. You'll see, I'm going to kill them all. Whatever, man. Stupid... You understand what they're saying? No. Don't know. It's that today is la conmemoracion del Estado Libre Asociado. It's Constitution Day. Oh, okay. But I thought Puerto Rico was, like, a colonized country. Something like that. It is. We're the oldest colony in the world. Well, that's easy to say. We have no natural resources. Tourism is it. What about reggaeton and sugar? The truth is, we know we can't be a dependent country forever. The economy is broke anyway, so something has to happen. To that day, salud. - You hear anything about the ring? - No. Not yet. I'm sure it's somewhere. Ma, you're always losing something and then you find it. He's speaking the truth. I hear you're working on a song. - We are. - What is it? Well, you know, it's a little bit of everything. You wanna hear it? No, no. Not while we're eating dinner. Maybe later. How you doing? Just working on my music. I know we haven't had a chance to talk about things. About us. Well, you don't have to. I just... I just want you to know... ...that I always thought about you. I know it's not fair for me to try to be a father... ...after all these years, but... So don't. It's not what you think. Look, who cares now? - You have to know, son. - No, I don't. L... No, I don't. I never thought I'd see the day I'd be getting money. Making music so haters can't take nothing from me. When chicks wouldn't holler I'd just play back. All I had was a flow and a ball cap. Wall to wall, boom, boom across the room. Thinking they'd be dancing to me soon. I'm in the game but I'm still in the streets. Prepped for Harlem and Puerto Rico. Puerto Rico, Puerto Rico. Puerto Rico, Puerto Rico. Puerto Rico. That was hot. You guys make a crazy team together. Oh, thanks. We appreciate, you know what I'm saying? The recording spot. Thanks. You're welcome. Where's Javi? Oh, he had to run some errands. Yeah. So... ...what you wanna do? Do you know a place where we can go get some drinks? You know, there's a place like this in New York. Or New York is just like this place. Looks like in Puerto Rico, you can go all day and all night. Do you dance to this music? No, not really. - Why are you laughing? - Why not? - Because I don't dance, you know? - I'll show you. Come on. - Welcome back. - Yeah, I'll be right back. Don't go too far. Hi. How are you? Very good. How are you? I'm just waiting for my class to start. This must be fate. Yeah. I'm waiting too, you know, for that phone call. So? I asked, and we're just... We're not allowed to. - Really? - Yeah. - Okay, well... - What are you...? Just down here scouting talent. - You don't happen to sing, do you? - No. I don't sing. But I have some friends that are really talented. Really? I'd love to hear them. I can get you their music if you want. That'd be great. That'd be excellent. Okay. How long are you in town for? - Just a couple more days. - Okay. We'll talk. - Call me? - Yeah. I've heard that before. If you don't call, I'll call you? Bye. So I heard you had a date last night. - How did it go? - It was cool. We went to the club, chilled... ...you know, danced and stuff like that. It was cool. I enjoyed myself. So do you like the music here, or...? Oh, yeah, yeah, the music is real different. - I like it. - Marivi. Ready? Okay, I'll see you at home. See, yo, I don't know nothing you just said, man. Talking in Spanish. Come home soon because I'm going to cook. - Really? - Yes. Well, then I'll run home. Give me another beer. The total is $ 15, including this one. Hey, I said it's $ 15! I already heard you. Can you settle up? It's just that I'm about to close... You will not close because... I put money in the jukebox... ...I put money in the pool table. I'm having a drink, and you're going to throw me out? - Can I get you something else? - Margarita, please. Right away. This is really good. I'll be right back. You know, I never thought that he would go after your family, Rob. I'm so sorry. Look, don't worry about it. Marivi, she's gonna be okay. Plus, I know it wasn't your fault. You know what I'm saying? I had some good news for you. The record producer that I met? He really liked your demo. Oh, yeah? Yeah. Look, I'm gonna get back inside and see how she is. - See you later, all right? - Okay. See you. Hey. I'm sorry, I didn't... Let's go outside. How is she? Yeah, she'll be okay. They're gonna let her out tomorrow. So, what's gonna happen to the dude who did it? He'll be dealt with. Who? You or the man? There's a way of doing things in our neighborhood. She was asking about you. I didn't know if I should come in there or not. I'm happy you did. - Hey, Vico. - Vico. Hey, Vico. - Yo, Vico, where you going? - The mayor has a message for you. - Vico. - Around here, we don't hit no woman. - Vico. - Yo, the mayor doesn't like that, man. - Beating up on women? - What were you thinking, huh? You're not bigger. The rules are the rules. So anyway, as I was saying to C. C... ...you put together a kick-ass demo... ...but I got a producer who's gonna take you to the next level. All right? Okay. But we want to be able to do our music the way we want to. Right. And the guy I got in mind, he's the best. Best producer in New York. Peter Black is his name. Produced Usher, everybody. And you're gonna love him. Gonna love him. Well, let me talk it over with my business partner. You should. But you gotta do it quickly because I gotta get out of town. - All right, cool. - All right. - So you'll let me know? - I will. Thank you for seeing us. Take care. My pleasure. Thanks, C.C. All right. I expect a call. So? I don't know. What do you mean you don't know? Do you understand what just happened here, Rob? I mean, I understand. But I don't know if you do. A record executive just left here. Wants to cut your record, you're talking about something else. Calm down, mama. Calm down. Look, Robert, I think she's right. What we have to lose? Yeah! So it's off to New York. Yeah, exactly what you wanted. Actually, it's even better. - Yeah, why? - Because you're coming. Oh, and also because Jeffrey wants to introduce me... ...to some artist managers that need dancers for music videos. Yeah, that's cool. - That's good, right? - Yeah. - What's wrong? - Nothing. You sure? Okay, well... ...guess I'll talk to you later. - Okay. - Phone. - Bye. Call you. Hi, Ma. So we got a producer who wants to record us in New York. That's great. What about the guys that are looking for you? The producer got us a place to stay in Brooklyn, so he won't find me there. - I'll text you the address, all right? - Okay. Meet me there. I love you. Love you too, babe. Hey, Robert. What are you doing here? Well... I came to tell you that I'm leaving. What? You're leaving? Why? We got a gig back in New York. - You serious? - Yeah. Congratulations. You know, I've been wanting to talk to you for a long time. Something I really need to tell you. Have a drink with me. You know, when I met your mother... ...I was playing with a band in New York. And I... I was a mess at that time. Booze... ...drugs. We had our whole life in front of us. One night, after the show... ...Tanya was waiting for me in the car with you. You were... You were just a baby then. And I got behind the wheel and I was drunk. And we had a horrible accident. Now, thank God we survived. Tanya didn't wanna speak to me after that. She asked me to leave. So I came down here to start over. And I was calling her and calling her... ...but she had disappeared with you. I couldn't play music after that. And I never again returned to New York. It's still all about you. You know, it's always been about you. Look, as far as I'm concerned, I didn't have a father. And now all of a sudden you and my mom decide that I do? You know, man, maybe if you hadn't abandoned us in the first place... ...I wouldn't have ended up like this. Hiding, running. I'm supposed to be dead. Robert, I am so sorry. Just forget it, man. So I guess you'll be leaving us soon. Yeah. That's too bad. Well, I just wanted to tell you that I really appreciate you... ...you know, allowing me to stay here and all. And I'm really sorry about the trouble and stuff. It's okay. Look, before you go, something I wanna show you. Go in that box, in the corner. This one? Sit down. These are yours. Your father always looks at those... ...every time your birthday comes around. September 28th, right? What's wrong? I mean, I wasn't gonna sell it or anything. I don't know why I took it. I just... I'm sorry. Don't worry. I'll just tell him I found it somewhere. You have every right to feel the way you do... ...but just so you know... ...he was so happy to see you. Take care of yourself, okay? - Do you have your tickets? - Yeah, I think so. Do you have everything you need? Take it easy. All right. Let's go to New York. - Take care of them. - Okay. Listen to it, okay? Okay. And make sure you clap when the plane lands. It's tradition. Man, it feels good to be home. What up, New York? Yo, man, look at this. This is dope. Man, this is crazy. I told you guys Jeffrey was gonna hook us up. Well, I hope this place comes with a cleaning lady. - What's good? - Hey. I'm saying let's go out. Let's go out and celebrate. Hey, man, why don't you come soup your boy up? Yo, have you spoken to your ex since you got back? No. You still think about her? I mean, from time to time, but, I mean, you see what I got. Hey, she got that spice, son. For real. Don't let it happen again, my nigga. You talking about the falling-in-love thing? Never. Never. You wanna dance? Never. Never. So, what do you think? It's got a layer of African fusion. I mean, I don't mind combining it with something else... ...I just wasn't too crazy about that, you know? Yeah, I think the boys were hoping to stick to the original beat. Is that right, guys? - Did you at least listen to our demo? - What demo? The one sent from the office. They didn't send that? - No. - You gotta be kidding me. Javi, do you got some music on you? Yeah. All right. All right, all right. I can work with this. Well, all right, then. You kids can take it from here. - Absolutely. - C.C., let's jet. Where you going? He's gonna introduce me to some artists for a music video. - We'll do something tonight, all right? - All right. - See what you can do. - No, I got it. It's gonna be great. - Be back later, all right? - Yeah. Bye. Bye. - Hey, baby. - There she is. - What's going on? - What do you mean? You know exactly what I mean. You're acting weird. Did I do something? I don't know, you tell me. Look, I thought we had plans tonight. Like, tonight. Rob, look, I'm sorry. Jeffrey took me around everywhere, and my battery died today... Oh, come on, man. Look, I understand you gotta go out, do your thing... ...but it's the way you doing your thing. Using what you got to get to the next level. - So you have a good time? - What? - You and Jeffrey. - You don't know a thing about me. All I know is what you told me, okay? How you always wanna get what you want. Fuck you. I don't need this. Damn it. Where to, miss? I'm going to Manhattan, Okay. I'm glad you called. So this is my apartment. - It's nice. - Thank you. Can I get you a drink, or do you wanna talk about anything? No, thank you. I just... - I'd rather just go to sleep. - You sure? - Yeah. - Okay. Well, let me show you where you're going. You can stay down here. You got fresh sheets and towels and a bathroom back here. You can make yourself at home. Let me try this. Now it's better. Yeah. - Hi, boys. - You guys know Noelia, right? She's got an amazing voice. Jeffrey asked me to have her sing the hook on your song. - What? - No, no, no. No way. Yo, look, my man, we've been talking to you all day. Those are not even the tracks that we gave you. Now you asking us to incorporate somebody on our hook? We need something commercial, something people already know. - People are tired of the same old. - Yeah. We were brought here to make our music. - We are making your music. - No, we're making your music. You know what? If you don't like it, you know where the door is. - Come on, come on. - Okay, okay, stop. Take it easy. Come on. We are going to lose the deal, man. Look, man, I understand that this is a great opportunity... ...but I'm not feeling this, man. Damn, we're so close. Close to what, Javi? That music in there was wack. And we can't do it like this. This is not how dreams come true. If we gonna do it, we gotta do it our way. Let me deal with it. All right, whatever. Yeah, bye. What happened? Your friends just quit. Don't worry about it. Anyway, I invited some artists over for cocktails. But why? That's all I'm asking. Why would you quit? Ma, they was messing up the music. But these people are professionals. Maybe they were trying to help you. Look, don't worry. I'm not gonna be like dad. What do you mean? He told me what happened. Don't worry, Ma. I understand. You do? - I love you, Ma. - I love you too, son. New Yorkers are preparing for the annual... ...Puerto Rican Day parade this Sunday. Many of our local celebrities will be attending.
