Don't I always help you? Get it! Get it yourself! You dare talk to me like that? Your car is a wreck. I brought it from your brother. Put the tire on. I can't. Go to your mother. Nur. -Yes. I need your help. Give this towel to Grandpa. Give it to Nasri. Nasri. Yes. Slowly. Be carful. Yes. Close your eyes, Grandpa. Studies come before marriage. First a diploma, then the wedding. Okay? Yes. Yihyah! Yihyah! Yihyah! Yihyah, wake up! Hold your sister! I felt something bad would happen. But I didn't know what. I didn't know that it would happen to my neighbour Yihyah. Hurry up! He was a good boy who didn't harm anyone. He was killed for nothing. He was killed because of us. The whole thing started in my uncle's cafe... when a Bedouin came demanding "protection" money. My uncle shot him without thinking. He didn't know that he belonged to the Abul-Zen clan. one of the strongest families in the south. They burned his house and cafe and tried to kill him. After a while my uncle got tired of hiding. They hurt him badly, but failed to kill him. That's why they came to us. They meant to kill my big brother, but shot Yihyah by mistake. He didn't do anything. I soon realized we were also in danger. and the worest time in my life began. My mother wanted us to leave Jaffa and hide. That same day, my sister left to Jerusalem. I left the next morning. I didn't know what would happen to us, or when I would return. But I was more worried about my brother. who refused to leave home. My brother says that fear is the biggest disgrace. and the only cowards run away. - A j a m i - sub by::: sadelanwar Wow! Stop here. Hello. - Hi. Where's Khamis's place? -There.

Hi, Anan. -Let's go. I can't. Let's go! I can't. -We're not going far. I can't. I'm carrying a "thing". Carrying a "thing"?! Are you stupid? Leave it inside and come! Don't be afraid. Abu Elias will help you. He resolves conflicts. He's powerful. Everybody respects him. Why are you tense? -He's afraid to leave the house. Your're safe with me. No one can touch you. I'll wait here. -Okay. Come, Omar. -I'm smoking a cigarette. Wait here. I'll call you. Bon appetite. Hello. -Hello. You want a table? -No, I'm waiting for a friend. Something to drink? Something hot or cold? Nothing? Omar, come on. You can go now. Hello. Hello. Please, sit. Samih was your father? The carpenter? May he rest in peace. How can I help you?

A 15 years old kid. They thought it was me. How is your uncle? -He's badly injured. Really? And the Bedouin? He's paralyzed. Who's the "Elder" of your family? My Grandfather. But he's half paralyzed.

Everything is okay, Mom. That's his house. The green door. Who is it? Hello. Hi. -Hello. Is Abu Elias here? -He'll be here. Come in. He told us to come. He'll be here soon. If he ... then ... He went out for 5 minutes. Something to drink? Hot? Cold? Actually. I need the restroom. Right here. - Thank you. We came to ask for your hand. -No! I spoke with my mother. -You can't.

I talked to some friends of mine. and they agreed to cover you. your trustee is Hajj Krayem, on of the "heaviest"... He's covering you, so now you're safe. Your children can return home. -For sure? Absolutely. You hear, Mom? -We paid for a "peace request", as a down payment. Why? For a 3 days cease fire. We have a 3 days to reach an agreement. Bear in mind that it will cost a lot of money. It will be expensive. How will we pay? God the Almighty will help. Praise God, but you know we're... -God will help. Let's hope they agree to reconcile. We'll settle the amount and move on from there. Let me. Go finish your homework. If I need you. I'll call. Thank you very much. Can't someone tell them that. -No. They want to kill. It's not my children's fault. It's his uncle. They don't care. It's the same family. Not just him, they want to kill the entire family. Money is the only solution. Did you talk to your uncle? He is in hospital, detained by the police. Anyway he's broke. He got nothing but debts. What can I do? I'm like Yihyah. Without money or power... you're nothing. No one would care if you die. It's a jungle. The strong eats the weak. What are you doing here? What are you doing here, you ass? I came an hour ago. -Who brought you? I came. -Who brought you? -Bedouin village, south of Israel- Welcome. Please consider, Judge... -Go ahead. The uncle was working in his cafe, One of the Abul-Zen family showed up. carrying a gun, and shooting in the air. It was a question of shooting or being shot. God wanted us to shoot first. We don't deny shooting. It was self defense. Why should we attack him? Why? Why should we attack him? Was it greed? By God, we're not greedy. He shot us and abandoned us, forcing us to defend our pride. -May God protect you. Is this someone to shoot?! A child?! Shooting the uncle wasn't enough. They wanted Omar too. Omar sold his car to his neighbour. They came looking for Omar. As the neighbour was fixing the tire they shot and killed him. It is your call, Judge. -May God protect you. Yes, Abu Muhammad. -It's not true. They can't prove I ever killed anyone. I'm innocent. They are the attackers. -Right! I wanted to solve it peacfully, but he disappeared. May God protect you! I ask refuge from the devil. In the name of God. Say a prayer for the Prophet! the first 3 days are 3,000 Dinars. Did you write? -Yes. Add 37 days multiplied by 500 Dinars. The man who lost his manhood, can't bear children or work... Yes. -Owed to Abul-Zen family. Reduce one third as a courtesy to the judge. Now to the man who was shot in the legs. Also in the belly. -Okay. Is your injury permenant or temporary? By the fear of God, Permenant. Then it's a "half dead". Did you write? -Yes. Reduce one third. What's left? -33,000 Dinars. Subtract one from the other. What's left? -47,000. For God. reduce 7,000 Dinars. That's not enough for God. Judge, you can't do this! You have no right. You have no right. I am supposed to decide. Judge! Judge! Judge! leave it 47,000, and that's enough! My man is paralyzed. Give God 5,000. leaves us with 42,000. Yes. -Okay. We desire your generosity. For my loved ones. from this corner to the other... May God protect you. What's left? 38,000. -38,000. Enough. Trust God. -Drink coffee. Drink your coffee. Shake hands. God protect you. Congratulations, Abu Muhammad. God protect you. -God protect you. Forgive him! I forgive you, son. -How much is left? He'll agree to reduce it to 35,000. (57,000$). Greetings. Greetings. I promise you we'll get the money. Even if I have to work 24/7 without sleep. You have to trust me. You're not a little kid anymore If we are strong, no one can hurt us. It only depends on us. Son of a bitch. Go ahead! Shoot! Shoot at the ground. That's it. Enough. I found us a house up north. We're leaving Jaffa. We're moving out in 10 days. No one has to know. Do you know who we're dealing with?! These are serious people. They'll find us anywhere. How? -They'll find us, Mom. Wherever we go in this country, they'll find us. Omar, you know how much we've raised untill now?! in 10 days we have to leave. After the 45th day, the price will be 114,000 $. And they'll be after us. Running away?! It will ruin us. Hide it. -People pay like assholes. Hello. How are you? How much? -Fill it up with 95. Is everything okay? Hello. We have a Gas Credit Charger. We're selling at half price. -We're selling gas. Who? -My brother and Shata. Thank you very much. Press the gas and the clutch. Quick. so no one can sees you. God damn! (670$). What's so great?! Not worth the risk. What can we do? Sell. -Sell what? Drugs. Who'll let you sell drugs?! Are you stupid? Who? I need money, and you're saving "no"... Get money, how? How? You always manage, right? -I manage 1000, 500... connect me to the guy. I'll do it. What guy?! I'll sell. No problem. -Fuck off. What's the problem?! To sell stuff?! To sell drugs you need connections. People have to know you're selling Sell to the wrong guy, and he'll rat you ou. And you'll go straight to jail. And in jail. You'll wiped out easily. Plenty of hit men in jail. It's not a path we can take. I have no choice. Leave town! Leave town! -I won't. -Why? If you stay you have no chance. You have 20 days. Mom. Mom. -Yes. dear. Where is Omar? Why? I think something bad happened to him. Did you see anything? -No. Dreamt anything? -No, I didn't. He's fine, I'm sure. Why are you so worried? You're are too big for all these fears. Stop worrying. I can't sleep. Come, dear. Call him. I'll call him. Allah is He besides Whom there is no god, the Everliving, the Self-subsisting by Whom all subsist; slumber does not overtake Him nor sleep; whatever is in the heavens and whatever is in the earth is His; ho is he that can intercede with Him but by His permission? He knows what is before them and what is behind them, and they cannot comprehend anything out of His knowledge except what He pleases, His knowledge extends over the heavens and the earth, and the preservation of them both tires Him not, and He is the Most High, the Great. -Second chapter- Nablus, Palestinian Territories.

It's been three weeks... Aryeh. When you came here... and I told you that they make noise once a year... you believed me?! -Yes, Am I farmer?! A sheep bleats once a year? -Am I a vet?! That's the way sheeps are. Okay. I may seems like a goldfish, but I'm a shark. Listen! I've already checked everything with the municipality. According to law you can't raise animals here. Cut the fish talk. Am I a fisherman? -No, listen! Screwing my head with the municipality... According to your laws we shouldn't be here at all, don't piss me out with your laws! Listen!

[Hebrew] Daddy... [Hebrew] What heppened? -A stabbing. Dispach, from 71... Assaf Harofeh St., a man lying on the street. Stab wound in the chest... Wait... No pulse. Starting CPR. Copy that... Go, Dando! Go, Dando! Go, Dando! Dando, go! I want to tell him something. I want to talk to him. No! Let me go!... In a place of poverty, despair, and drugs gangs... a gun or a knife are easy to draw. Last night the victim was a father of three. He was stabbed in the heart, and died within seconds. Mommy is here. -Hi. Mommy is here. -How are you? I have poop. -Really? -Yes. Shall we change your diaper? -No. Daddy. Daddy? Great! Maybe Mommy? Daddy's tired. -No, Daddy.

Someone said he saw him in this area... maybe... -Why here? Maybe he became religious and he's hiding. Anything's possible. Put it on the bulletin board. Only a prayer can help. Pray everyday. and you'll find him. Guaranteed. Song of Ascents... I turn my eyes to the mountaines... from where. will my help come? My help comes from the Lord, creator of heaven and earth. He will not let you fall. -Jewish village east of Tel Aviv- When it happened, I was in the U.S.A., I read that he was in military training, and had a dispute with the sergeant, He was confined to base... -Yes. and then called you to say he was coming home... to take clothes for the confinement and return to the base. Okay. And that was our last conversation. You still turn to the police or the army? To the police not at all. They're waiting for something to come up... They're not doing anything. Until it affects you personally, it's something on the news. When it's someone related to you, your life changes. It ends. In a few years, my daughter will go to the army. Will she come back? You connect everything with Yoni. There is no life. Our lives ended the minute he disappeared. And we don't know if he'll return. Is it possible that he is hiding? -No. absolutely not. But we don't know that. -Yoni was on his way home. They think that... from all the nonsense they've fed us... that maybe he's in a cult or religious... Someone kidnapped him, and is holding him by force. But why would they do that? -But you know him. You know that he wouldn't hurt us like that. But, Mom, sometimes... Maybe... Maybe he got hooked up with people and ideas... that we don't even realise. Within the few hours since he said he's coming home? He wasn't happy in the army. But at home he was happy. -Okay. He was on his way home. -As far as we know. You want to go out for a while? I'm sorry. Don't be. You have nothing to be sorry for. For hurting you all... -You're not hurting anyone. I still have the two of you. -You have the three of us. You're strong, and we all love you. Drive slowly, so you don't lose the exhaust pipe I hate this fucking place. It's like Gaza here. Selling? -Yes. How much? -20 shekels. -Give me! What size are they? What size? How do I know? Question is where you get them. -Fucking... Fuck you! Where did you get them? Go...! You... Tell me where you got them. -From the garbage. You're lying. -Put them back in the garbage. Put them back! You asshole! Go ahead, I'm listening. On Tapuakh St... You'll find Salem Abed in a grey Honda. He's under house arrest. -Right. He's breaking house arrest. Make a right! Copy. I'll pick him up. [Arabic] I'll bust his head. Guys! Move your car! Abed Salem. -Move the car! What's up? -Hello... -Everything's okay? Get out! -Opening the car without telling me?! Get out! I'm not Abed. -Abed, get out. Okay. Let go of my arm. Your brother? -My neighbour. We're police. Everything's okay. But why is he...? Raed! Saleh! We have crowd interference. Wait a minute! Salem, I'll fuck you! Salem, I'll fuck you! I'll fuck you! -Move, damn it! Run away! Run away! Abed Salem is a drug dealler. sells drugs in the neighbourhood, Police try to arrest him, to help them. and they hit the police. -Because you reduced the pressure. because if you didn't... -They help a criminal escape. and you feel this small, and the people criticize you. They understand nothing. The street has its rules. Act accordingly! We have 70 burglaries a night. Burglaries, stake-outs... and arrests around the clock?! We're exhausted. Angel, you wanted to be a cop? Excuse me, why arrest a drug dealer? His neighbours, whose kids buy his drugs, help him and release him. Why? Because they hate us! Guys, I don't want this to be... It's hot? -Yes. Right. Let's wait for it to cool, and then get in, okay? -Yes. -Okay? Is that good water? You want good water? -Yes. -Okay. Close your eyes! And again! What's this? Washing the neck... and the tush... and the push-push. Close your eyes! And again... Daddy! -What? Daddy! -Daddy! Daddy, you're cute? -Daddy's cute? -Yes. Yes. Hi. How are you?

What? -Something wrong? My father called. -And? Everything okay? My mother is very sick. She's in the hospital. Today... She threw up and went to the hospital. it's serious. Go to her. I have to wait till the evening for the van. No! Is your car here? Yes. Take him now? Now! Here's 150 shekels for gas. Take this for a taxi from the checkpoint. Tell Anan... -I'll tell Anan. Go! Talk to Anan and... -Don't worry. Take this. Have a safe journey. Come on. -Go, go. Go. See you, Binj. -Go. [Hebrew] Binjook! -You're killing me. Then you drive! -No, no, you drive... It's a new car, I can't... Binjook, sing something. Should I keep you, or find me a newer model? Whatever. I'm with you for fun... -Really?! For fun... Get to the party by yourself then... Hello. Hello. Hello. [Arabic] Dad. [Arabic] Yes, Dad? I'm in TelAviv, why? At a party. What do you want? What? where is he? Where did he go? Yes. He packed a bag?! Okay. I'm coming. Bye. Your brother was with Nizar and Ihab. and the Jewish neighbour came, and complained abou the sheep. As I understood, Nizar stabbed the Jew. The police are all over looking for them. Okay, Rabih. talk to you later. [Hebrew] Good evening. -Good evening. Where are you from? -Bat Yam (Jewish city). Go, bro, Go on. [Arabic] Daddy, what happened? [Hebrew] Who are you? -I'm his son. What's your name? -Take your hands off! Get your hands off! Let go! Let go of me! Wait! Wait! Wait a minute. What are you doing to my son? -What's wrong? What are you doing to my son? -We want to talk to him... and you can't stop us. We can do it the easy way or the hard way... What do you prefer? -Let go of him! -I won't hurt him. Take him to the station! Now! What's his name? Wait! What's your name? -Hanna. Hanna. Take him away! Angel! Get him out of here! I can't breathe. Leave him alone! He's old. -Get in! Okay, I'm getting... To the second car! Take him away! Sit down and shut up. -Angel, go! Inform me when you're there. [Arabic] Is he involved in this? Did they said that he's involved? I don't think he did anything. It must be a mistake. It must be. -Must be a mistake. Who is it? Hi, Sisse. -Hi, Binj. What heppened? Trouble. Big big trouble. Heard anything? Last night, my brother came home, packed a bag and fled with your brother. But it's more complicated. Your brother gave me 200 gr. of "Snow"... and told me to keep it. I don't know what to do. You take care of it. -Whose is it? Your brother's and Nizar's. I don't care. I'm out of this! Why get me in trouble too? It's your brother's. You take care of it. Why are you staring? What can I do? How should I know? I did my part. Take care of it. [Hebrew] Let's be clear on one thing, We still don't know who did it... and we shouldn't blame Jaffa residents. [Arabic] Binj, it will calm down, your brother will return... It wasn't an Arab who got killed. They won't just patrol a bit and that's it. They're turning the world upside down. You know how many innocent Arabs are in jail? [Hebrew] What's he talking about? About what's going on. [Arabic] They'll frame him. They want to get rid of us. Enough. Omar! I need your car to move my things to Shelly. [Hebrew] What did you say? That's I'm moving out. [Arabic] Where to? -To Tel Aviv. Tel Aviv? Why? What about your family? You're abandoning them? I'm not leaving them. You're running away? I'm not running away. I'm moving out. I decided before. I want to live with her. [Hebrew] What is he saying? He's angry that I'm moving with you. He's not... We just don't want him to leave Jaffa. [Arabic] In time he grew distant, made Jewish friends... Frankly, I don't feel at home in this house. But we're like family. Brothers. -Brothers. That's why... -It's just... No matter what you say, that's you're proud to be an Arab, you've been pulling away from us lately. It's not about my Arab pride. It's only... [Hebrew] Rabih, you're welcome to visit. No problem. Yes, but... [Arabic] They humiliated your family, to make you think that. After all that happened, you want to live with them?! Where am I going? I need some fresh air... You don't understand. You're being swept away... [Hebrew] It's only 5 mins away. -It's the principle. [Arabic] But we're best friends... You wanna go, go! Go with her. Talk Hebrew with your kids. Make them Jews, I've nothing else to say. What are you talking about? Sit down! Fuck you and your Jews. -Rabih! Get going before Anan gets up. Take care. Who is it? [Hebrew] Hello. -Good morning. Who are you? -Who am I?! Who are you? Police. -Wait! Hey, you! Com here! Come here! I should be with you. -You should?! Thanks for teaching me. -Police. Put out the cigarette, please. It's not respectful. Thank you. Is there is anything in the house? -No. -Nothing. What's your name? -Stand up! What's your name? -He has my ID. What's his name? -Hanaa. -Hanaa. Farwaji. -Ah! Hanaa Farwaji... How are things, okay? Come over here for a second. Hanaa, what's up? Oh! Very nice... It's a good start. See? A bong for a start. -Not bad... Yeah... Is there's anything in the house? For sure? Search. -For sure. I'll turn everything upside down. -And put everything back. Really? The cleaning lady will put it back. For sure. Hanna, how's your brother? He sends his regards. Really? Where is he? I said it all at the station. But he sends regards... From where? From the Caribbean. Search there. -Let me... Let's search. Something smells fishy. Caribbean, my ass... You know where you smart asses end up. So, what for? I already said it all. You must know something... I said everything... -It's 5:00 a.m. What can I do? -What can you do? Found anything? We'll find something. Don't worry. Take everything out. So again, when did you speak to him? Three weeks ago. We both know it's not true. So, why ask? I'm asking something else... You don't want us to come again and again, and make a mess. You'll clean up, and we'll come back... What for? I told you... -No, you didn't. That's the problem. If you did, I wouldn't come here, at 5 a.m., messing up your place. All units! cops under attack... Police attacked. Dispatch, 171, we're on the way. Motherfucker? -Move. We'll be back. -Be my guest. We'll get him later. -Damn it! Get going! [Hebrew] Good morning, my love. I've got some "gun powder"... Are you coming? [Arabic] Close your eyes. Take a deep breath, and realx your mind. You feel calm and relaxed. [Hebrew] Calm down! What are you doing, Dando?! Dando! Malek! Your hands are becoming weightless. Then your feet. And then your whole body. On the count of three, you'll open your eyes, and find yourself in a different place. One. Two. Three. Open your eyes. -Nur, Daddy, Me, Omar- When Omar is beside me... I feel confident. -Last Chapter- What are you afraid of? I'm not going anywhere. I love you, Omar. You know that, right? We'll go on like this for two more years? Four? Five more years? No one will know? Our relationship will be like this? Meeting secretly in Tel Aviv? When the time is right... It'll be different... -How? Omar. My parents are dear to me and I can't... Won't you give me an answer? I'm telling you... In time... -I want an answer now. I've nothing to tell you. Omar. -Anan Transportation- Enough! Stop! Beg-a-Shata! Shata, Come on. Shata! What, Omar? -Enough. What's wrong? Give it back! It's my bottle now. Shata! Come on, Shata! What? -Please, stop it! Okay, sir, that's enough! Because you are... All right, go home! Go home! You're home! Go! Go! You make me sick. You're rude. Your tongue is like a razor blade. You're a good girl. Let me help you. Shata! Shata! Bye. -Come on already! I owe you a bottle. What's the matter, Omar? Stressed and anixious... Listen, man. When you're stressed, don't take it out on others. don't take it out on others. The "government" is here. What's the story? They're at Binj's place. What's going on? What happened? Rabih! What's wrong? Why are you crying? Shata... -What? -Binj is dead. What? What heppened, man? Let go! By God, man... What happened to Binj? Let me go! Rabih, what happened? What happened? Shata! Let go! -Shata! Let go! He's my friend. I want to see my friend. Let go of him. I'll fuck you. Let go of me. I want to see my friend. Hi, Omar. Hello, Abu Elias. Hi. Close the kitchen, and go to bed. Okay? Omar, can you take Hadir home? Anan took the car... to get things for the funeral. Okay. Take my car.

Who? -Omar. Me and Omar? Nothing. You take me for a fool? -Why? Passing your gum and touching him? I never touched him. You take me for a fool? -Dad! -What? You take me for a fool? Dad, I did nothing. -In front of me? I did nothing. -In front of my eyes? Dad... -Get your things and go home! I'll deal with you later. Go! Hello, Abu Elias. -Spare the politeness. Get the hell out of here. Don't ever touch my daughter. After all I've done for you, is this your thanks? Don't come anywhere near her, understand? Go home! Get out of my sight! I didn't do anything... -I'll break your bones. Get out! Get out! The car... Take it, and don't come back. Hello. Hello. Where's mom? -In Ramleh, at auntie's. Where's Hadir? -In her room Oh, man! Who is it? -It's me. Hi. Mom told me you're not getting out of your room. What's wrong? Why? Nothing. Alone in your room? Not eating or drinking? So what?! -What? -So what?! What do you mean? It happens. -No, it doesn't. Come eat with me. I don't feel like it. -Why? Why? -I'm not hungry. Is he worth all this crying? He's a nobody. It will end badly. You know that. Why are you crying?

He's the best in the world, for all I care. It's not... -You'll ruin our reputation. That's not it. You know what love is. Everyone marries within his own religion. You're Christian, he's a Muslim. You can't get married. No. I want to be with him. Don't tell me what to do. It's my life. It's the whole family's life. Is it always about the family? -Of course. -No. It's your father's life, your mother's, your brother's... You won't speak to Omar! Understand? You will never marry him. Don't even dream about it. Understand? I'll break your bones. End of discussion. That's it. Stay in your room. [Hebrew] Hello. -Yes, hi. I'm Momi. What's your name? -Rubbi. I heard you have stuff, Rubbi. -Yes, I do. Do you know me? -No. Anan told you about me? -A little. Tomorrow at 5:00 a.m, a man in a jeep, will be at the Shoken parking lot. He'll give you money, give him the stuff. Hold on, where? -Shoken parking lot. Yes. -Okay. Okay? -Okay. Did he hang up? -Yes, he said "bye". So? -Okay. You know where? -At Shoken parking lot. Yes, there. How will you go? -Are you taking Shata? Shata's in custody. Really? -Since the day Binj died. So you're going alone. I'm going with Malek. Who? Malek. How is he involved? -I got it through him. Malek? Are you stupid, taking Malek? I got it through him. Are you an idiot? He can't leave the resturant. He's illegal. Are you fucking stupid? Where's Malek? Malek. Malek, leave it. Come to the container. What's wrong? -Nothing. Go to the container. But I have to... -Forget about it. Go! Sit, sit. What is it What's wrong with you? -What? Haven't we been good to you? I'm asking you. -Why? Did we treat you badly? -No. Ever deprive you of anything? -No. Why are you doing this? -What? Selling drugs with Omar?! Selling drugs with Omar? Look at me! I'm talking to you. Speak! Why are you silent? Now you've ruined everything. Abu Elias doesn't want you here any more. You're leaving in 2 hours. Until then, stay in the container. But I wanted to help my mother. Selling drugs to help your mother?! Would she agree to this? -I didn't want to... So you admit it. I have no choice. Why? Don't we help her? Okay. I won't... -Won't how?! You'll ruin me and Abu Elias. We employ you illegally, and you deal drugs? You're stupid?! And my mother? -As much as I feel for you, go home, and don't come back. I'll work for you my whole life. -Forget it. Abu Elias. -What are you doing here? I told you to stay there. Beat it! I can't. -Do what he told you. Go! I don't want my mother to die. I'll do anything you want. Anything. For God's sake. For God's sake, Abu Elias. Hi. What's up? Anan, what's up? -Praise God. -Okay? Good. How are you, Abu Elias? -Hi. Excuse me. Come with me, Malek. What do you want? If I leave, she'll die. I'll do anything you say. I agreed to go only because he won't go alone. What was the plan with Omar? What? He's picking me up at 4:30. But I'll cancel everything. I didn't want to do it, but I don't want her to die. Okay, listen to me. Listen carefully. It's your last chance to prove you deserve my help. Go with Omar as planned. -No, I can't. Listen to me and do exactly as I say. Go with Omar as planned, but don't touch the drugs. Let him hold it. -I never touched it. You're going as planned. Understand? Let Omar hold the drugs. You will be caught. Police will ambush you. Understand? You'll be arrested and then sent home. Then you'll return here. Do as I say, and I'll help your mother. That's my condition. Understand, Malek? Whatever you want. Okay? That's it. Go to sleep. Thank you. Go to sleep. Go to the container and sleep. Omar, aren't you afraid? You're going to sell drugs. Go to sleep. You'll wake Mom. What if they harm you? Nasri, go to sleep. Omar. What are you doing? -I want to come. No. Get inside. Quickly. I'm worried about you. If Mom wakes up, I'll kill you. It will ruin everything. Quick. -I'll stay in the car. Are you stupid? You think it's a game? Don't piss me off. I'll stay in the car. -Go home! You're ruining everthing. We'll wake Mom. Go!

Something bad will happen. I'm fed up... Enough, be a man. Don't be a coward. Come on. Easy, man. -Sit in the car! Sit in the car! Sit in the car! Come on, Malek. [Hebrew] Dando, what's up? Any contact with Yossi? Is it a "go"? I can't hear you. Not yet. Any contact with Yossi? Is it a "go"? Damn radio! Get me one that works. Good morning. They're here, Menahem. Menahem. Hurry up! Why? What time is it, Malek? Nobody keeps me waiting. -Sorry... I've things to do. You brought it? Are you kidding me? Are you kidding me? What is it? -Are you joking? -No. A joke? -No. [Arabic] What's happening? -He says it's not drugs. Are you kidding me?! -What now? Yossi! Grab him! -Omar! Calm down! [Arabic] Run Omar! It's Binj's murder! Run Omar! It's Binj's murder! It's Binj's murder! [Hebrew] What's wrong, Dando? Dando! What's wrong? -It's my brother's watch. Where did you get it? Where did you get it?
