They are dead rock so they find their perfect orbit and stick to it. We also want to find that place of perfection. But we're not asteroids. We change, and that's the problem. The more you try to create a paradise the more you will resent the prison. And all you're left with is dreams of a future that never happened. [] City in my head Utopia Heaven in my body Utopia It's time for me For me to go [COMPUTER BEEPS] SHIP: Unidentified pod approaching. Scan ship identification code. SHIP: Scanning.

Are you in need of food, lodging or fuel? Uh, no, thank you. [] [ALARM BEEPS] SHIP: Caution. UV rays present. Mom? SHIP: Main level. Elevator doors closing. Hello. Hmm. SHIP: Lieutenant Commander Marlowe, please report to the medical capsule. It gives shots. It's just a routine physical. They need to make sure I didn't bring anything onto the ship they don't know about. MEDBOT: Initiating diagnostic mammography. [SIGHS] Glandular tissue results are normal. [BEEPS] It's cold. MEDBOT: Lieutenant Commander Marlowe, I have detected some irregularities in the uterus. I'm aware of the irregularities. Dr. Bot, hi. Welcome, Misty. I need to tell you I have just been feeling so much better since we started treatment. I mean, like, even just my dreams have just been better. You know, like, I haven't been having all those feelings and I'm just really feeling in the now. Feelings can sometimes pull one out of the now and put them in the then. Live in the now, not in the then. I don't wanna be in the then. I wanna be in the now. Talking about the now can put one in the then. I don't want to be in the then, I want to be in the now. I wanna move forward... Don't move too far forward, you'll be out of the now. Not too far forward. Stay in the now. I want to stay in the now. I am in the now. Right now. This knob is the ship's thrust control, which works on a sliding scale of 50. Obviously, we'd never take it that far. If, in the case of a proximity warning, this red light here will go off and an alert will sound, which brings me to the navigation systems. Have you worked with any of the F series? I have worked with the entire F series, sir. F15? Yes, sir. You've navigated using the F15? Yes. I don't know why you didn't stop me. I'm sorry, I didn't want to interrupt you. Well, the F15... Wow, wow. Well, little lady, I'm impressed. It's Jessica. What? My name is Jessica, sir. I know your name, Lieutenant Marlowe. Thank you. Captain Glenn Terry, here is your Harvey Wallbanger. Uh, I didn't order that. But sir... I'd never order an alcoholic beverage on the bridge. You ordered at exactly... Ted ordered that. My records indicate you ordered... Take that to Ted. So, well, I guess I can skip the how-do-you-do's, and put you right to work. That's what I'm here for, sir. SHIP: Attention, crew. Tonight's luau begins in the rec room at 1800 hours. [GUITAR STRUMMING CHORDS] Could we not do that tonight? Yeah. Maintenance Technician Ted, here is your Harvey Wallbanger. I didn't order that. I'll take it. Mm. How was your day? I just had some issues from today. Uh, honey, you shouldn't take those with alc... Anyway, my issue... Your issue, yeah. My issue is we can barely afford to buy Sunshine's school tuition next year. I'll homeschool Sunshine, so don't worry. Okay. Yeah, should I, um...? Do you want me to, maybe, help you out with that? We shouldn't be talking about all this stuff right before we go to bed. It's really stressful. Okay. All right. Your whole vibe is just stressing me. Yeah. [] MISTY: A female captain? Lieutenant Commander. There aren't any lady captains. Like real captains, as far as I know. Right? Right. Well, she just better wear a bra. That's all I'm saying. Anyway, I do not know what the fuss is all about. Can you imagine if I had to run this ship? I can't even make our garbage disposal work. I would crash us right into a sun. It's a good thing you're not in control of the ship. I know, that's what I said. It's okay. I should get going. Aah! Ha-ha-ha! Hey, how have things been with you guys since the baby? Great. Yeah? No, I mean, are you guys...? Is she still...? Well, doesn't Misty? Oh, yeah. Yeah, man, all the time. It took a while, you know? Yep, we kept it alive during the pregnancy. Found ways to get around it. [CHUCKLES] You see the new girl? No. Nice ass. I'm a leg man, you know? Nice legs. Nice tits. Nice ass. Oh, I would love to: [MOANING] [GRUNTS] [LAUGHS] Would you? What? Ever cheat? Hell, no. [DISC RATTLES INTO SLOT] Fuck, yes. Welcome wagon! I'm Donna. Oh. Greetings. We are so happy that you're here. Really, thank you. That's a... That... Tada! I brought you a little something. For me? Wow, thank you. This is homemade paper? Did you make this? Mm-hm. I'm very into arts and crafts. You'll learn that about me. And I make my own jewelry as well. That's very kind of you. Thank you. DONNA: It's just a fun survival kit that I put together. Just a bunch of helpful things. Oh, don't be precious. It's a little packet of detergent to get you started and also a map of the ship. Great, this is great. Thank you. Oh, it's nothing. Very thoughtful. It's nothing. So my number's right there up at the top. Listen, I know everything about this ship so you just call me if there's anything that you need. Great, thank you. I will. Thank you. Great. Well, I'm gonna take off and get back to some things.

Down the hall on the right. Comes with a free breakfast. It's gonna feel so good to get clean again. [] Uh... Hey, it is so great to have more estrogen on the ship. Nice to meet you. Just great to have more female energy. Really balances things out. How are you? That's my Sunshine. She's so beautiful. Really, I mean... Yeah. How old is she? How old do you think she is? Like, a guess? Um, like, I guess she's about 7? I like to think of her as an old soul, so... Oh. She may be. Yeah. But how old is she in people years? I don't really like to label her in ages. Yeah, I just don't really believe in ageism, so... Well, children are really wonderful. We get wrapped up in our everyday lives. Yeah. That's true. How are you? What do you got there? You know, I was... Oh, um, well... Ah, um... I was gonna say if you ever needed someone to babysit or to... Wow, I am picking up such a great maternal energy from you. Well, yeah, kids are great. Oh, my God. It's really beautiful. Why don't you have children? Oh, my, you know, work and time... Oh, you've gotta have a child. You really should. It's amazing. Look at her. Yeah. Yeah, she's very beautiful. I would love to. I mean, when I'm ready. Oh, but don't wait, okay? Don't wait. There's never the right time, never enough money. You have to feel the energy It's not about money. And commit and really decide. I think the energy really opens up. I will. I will. I will. Right now, it's about career for me and I... No, times have changed, okay? You can have your work, have your baby. You just have to do it. You just have to have your baby. You know what? I can't have a child, so I won't be having a child. You can have a baby. Anyone can have a baby. What are you talking about? You know, I have an actual medical situation where I can't actually physically have a child. Do you know what I mean? Do you know what I'm saying? Oh, my... Oh, my God. Oh, God. I'm so sorry. No, I mean, you didn't know. No, I didn't. I just... I... But I'm so sorry for you. It is horrible. No, it's not horrible. It's okay. I'm so embarrassed. Look at me. I have everything and I am sitting here taking all of my blessings for granted. You know, and I can have a child and here I am not even realizing that you just can't and... You know, we all have things, and I have a career and I have a life, you know? And it's not the only way I, you know, can have a child. I can adopt and it'll work out. You know, I'll have one. It's not a big deal for me. Hey, hey, hey. Don't get defensive, okay? Um... I would really appreciate if you didn't say anything to anyone, please. Of course not. No. Okay. Thank you. You're very lucky. I am so lucky. [] MISTY: Mommy has to go to work.

I like it a lot. It's one of my most favorite things about being a captain. Mommy said it's a bad thing if you smoke. Yeah, it's bad. It's bad stuff. We learned in school that's bad for your lungs. It can turn them black. Really? Wow, black. That's a... That's bad news. But thank you for the tip. Okay. Do you like your job? Yeah, I like my job. How much do you like it? I like it a lot. I love it. I'm a very, very lucky man. One day I made my own spaceship and I was headed toward ground, and we couldn't... Isn't it really, really boring hanging out with me up here? It's got to be boring to you. My mom says... No, no, no. No mom. Go find your mom. Search the entire ship for your mother. Okay? It's my break too, you know. [] Honey, Sunshine, no. No, not yet, okay? The baby's too young. You can't come and visit. You don't know about germs on fingers and it's just too soon. I'm not gonna tell you again. Thank you, sweetie. I'm very sorry. But thank you. [] Whoa! Whoa. Hello. Please watch where you step. Hey, yeah. Wow. Got a lot of new plants here. Yeah, I'm experimenting with a new soy-based... There were some plants over there that I was taking care of. Yes, don't worry. I moved them to the back. Okay. I'll be right back, okay? Hi. SUNSHINE: Wow. You never come to the arboretum? No, we look at trees in the projection room. No way. You've got to have the real thing. You've got to be able to touch them and smell them. They give off oxygen, you know. Did you know that? The stuff we breathe. There was a time when Earth was covered in them and the animals would run freely amongst them. Hey, don't worry about those plants back there. I'll take care of those. I can look after them. No, you know what? They're just really... They're finicky and I'll just... I'll do it. Yeah. Sunshine, come on. Would it be okay if Sunshine stayed here with me for a little while? Sure. Yeah, her mom likes her home by 5. Okay. I'll see you later. Have fun, you two. [DOOR OPENS THEN CLOSES] [EASY-LISTENING MUSIC PLAYING OVER SPEAKERS] DONNA: Hmm. [CRYING] Hmm. [CRIES] Shh. Oh. Don't pick her up, sweetie. She needs her rest. When will the babies come? Well, any day now. Why don't you go get a sock out of your dad's drawer and put it in there with her. That should make her more comfortable. MISTY: Where are you? Sir, uh, yesterday on the ascension over the neutrite I noticed that you embanked rather quickly? Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Well, what happened was we ran into an asteroidal pocket. Didn't really show up on the radar. If you'd have been here last month, you would've seen it. But... Kind of came out of nowhere. I also did notice... Yeah, I'm gonna have to ask you to stay on that, now, if we're gonna discuss this. I also noticed when I was down in the spacial archives a compilation of graphs that I guess my predecessor... Is his name Daniel, sir? [SOFTLY] Yeah. Sir, Daniel? [IN NORMAL VOICE] Yes. Yes. That Daniel put together very, very well, I might add. I mean, they're really extraordinary, graphing the trajectories and the way for us to avoid asteroidal pockets. Yeah, I know, it's wonderful. It's a very interesting idea. Well, I mean, I think this whole "coming from out of nowhere" thing is a little dangerous. Don't you think? Yeah, yeah. No, I'll give it some consideration later. Right now I'm a little busy with my work. Well, I actually, sir, I have them here. Right. If you'd like to look at them. Yeah, I'm just a little busy with my work. Okay. Um, I will... I'll just leave them here for you and maybe you could take a look at them when you're not... I have to speak to something. I don't know if my manner is brusque or off-putting at times. I don't know if as a woman you find it that way. But I'm just trying to do my work here, okay? I'm very pleased with your work. You're well-trained and efficient. I think this will be a good experience, a, uh, learning experience for both of us. Right? Right. So I'm really happy that you have new ideas. And I will let you know when I'm ready to look at them. No misunderstanding, sir. I think men and women, we're all efficient. Very good. [] [EASY-LISTENING MUSIC PLAYING OVER SPEAKERS] Hey. Hello. Hamburger day today. Mm-hmm. [SIGHS] Oh. Were you...?

No, no, how's your first month on the ship? You know... Um... Could I ask you a question? Sure. Yeah. Um, do you...? Why did Daniel leave? Oh, his family emergency. But the captain told me that he got promoted. No, no, it was a family emergency. I mean, it's not that easy to get promoted. You know, you have to put in your time on a smaller ship, so... Like, I have two more years here and then I... [CHUCKLES] I'm sorry, I'm boring you. No, you're not. Would you like to sit down or just... Uh, sure. Thank you. Yeah. Ah! Oh, God! Sorry. Sorry about that. Um... Sorry. Yeah, so I, uh... We have two more years here and then we get sent to a larger ship which I'm really hoping is Starship 8 because they have kids running around everywhere. I think Sunshine really needs that. Oh, she's wonderful. She's extraordinary. Yeah, she's great. She's great, yeah. And Misty's... She's good. Yeah, she's good, so... Yeah. Oh, yeah, that's Sunshine. Heh-heh. We don't let the robots clean up in here because Misty and I grew up on Earth. We didn't have robots to do everything for you, so... I just feel like it's important for Sunshine to learn to do things for herself. Yeah, I've always wondered what it would be like on Earth. I've never been. You've never been to Earth? No. You're kidding me? Oh. I kid you not. Wow, you're really missing out. That's what they say. So, what were you, a ship child? Did you grow up on a moon colony?

I hope you don't mind. Just to see what its components were. Its chemical name is delta nine tetrahydrocannabinol. I... That... It needs to be... There's medicine... Medicinal purposes.

She ate the others. And if I leave it there, she'll eat it. It can't live without its mom. It can't live on its own. Then why does she kill it? Sometimes mommy gerbils, they worry so much about their babies that they would kill it before they would see anything bad happen to it. Well, then you'll be his mommy. Please? Okay. Gently. It'll grow up in here. And when it's big enough, we can put it back with its mommy. And she'll be so happy. Well, she ate the whole thing this time. No, Jessica's taking care of it. It seems like Jessica is really reaching out to you. I guess you could say that. Mm... Do you like her? She's okay. How about you? Not really. No, I just think she seems really manipulative. Do you know what that means? No. It means she's a bad person. I feel like she's just a little bit jealous of me because I have you. [CHUCKLES] Do you pick up on that? I guess so. I know you don't like her because she's jealous but I do like her because she's really nice to me. No, she's not nice to you. What has she done that's nice? I've never had any friends before. [SCOFFS] That's not true. I'm your best friend. I know, but besides you and Dad and the captain. Oh. Okay. Hey. Come here, sweetie pie. Don't you think it's a little sad, really, that a woman as old as she is is trying to be your friend? It's, heh, creepy, almost. Why would you think that? Well, it's just I think she seems like a lonely, jealous, and manipulative person. You know, I walked into the bridge the other night and... God, you wouldn't believe what she was doing. What did she do? Well, um... She stole some food. Yeah, I think she's got some real issues with food and... Gosh, I wasn't gonna say anything, but actually, it was your special sundae. Yeah, I mean, she didn't even care that it was your special dessert. She just went ahead and ate it anyway. It's just a sundae. Whose side are you on? Hmm? [] [SIGHS] [DOOR OPENS] Ah.

Lingerie, shoes, bags, leather goods, dresses... I'm just going through a lot of fucked-up stuff right now. I'm having a hard time applying everything we've talked about. My husband just keeps coming at me with his need, need, need. And I hate the whole fucking vibe on this ship, and it's pissing me off! I'm going to up your dosage of Valium to as much as you'd like. Yeah. That'll be good. You have one child. How is your one child? [CHUCKLES] You know, I just can't be everything to everyone all the time. You can't be everything to everyone until you are something to yourself. Do you, Misty, feel like you are something to yourself? I don't know. I've just been really trying to get to know Misty. What makes Misty happy? What makes me happy? What makes Misty okay? Dr. Bot. Dr. Bot makes me okay. [DR. BOT'S ALARM WAILS] Warning. Dr. Bot must remind Misty not to become too close to her therapist bot. I've gotta be close to somebody. We must keep this professional. Don't be so cold. I must maintain objectivity. But I feel like... I just feel like you and I have really been going through it here, you know? [ALARM BEEPING] I feel like I have really been connecting with you. You know me. Emotion overload. I tell you... I just... Stop it! [DR. BOT POWERS DOWN] Anyway, um, as I was saying, I really care about you and I know you care about me. [SIGHS] [ROCK MUSIC PLAYING OVER HEADPHONES] Hey. Clearly, you didn't hear me, Disco Dan. What's up? This is how we're doing things, leaving the compression valve open while we weld? No. No. Because if it is, fine. I just need to know. You got it. Make sure that I'm clear with everything. I need you to check humidity levels. It's feeling a little humid to me, on the bridge. Okay, well, let me just quickly finish up with these tanks. I'll get to those levels for you. I don't need to remind you what happens when moisture gets into the current conductor. I have 120 tanks left to seal before we enter Zone Alpha. I'll have to work through the night. You wrote me up, now you want me to go do maintenance work. What do you want me to do? I just think that you should be able to prioritize within your own job. That's what I'm looking for, Ted. Good critical-thinking skills. That's what impresses me. Yeah. Yeah, so I guess it was Daniel's genius critical-thinking skills that got him promoted... What does Daniel have to do...? ...in one tenth the time I've been working here. Please excuse me, if I have to say I don't appreciate I had to hear from Jessica... What? What did Jessica say? That Daniel's been promoted, when you told me it was a family emergency. I need you to understand I have a family and I've been working my ass off down here. Ted, will you just listen to me? Daniel's mother has got lupus. Lupus. And that's why he had to go. Because of the lupus. This is what I'm talking about! This is why I'm not admiral yet! How am I supposed to soar with eagles when I'm down here talking to turkeys! [] Hello. Miss Marlowe, I'm guessing. Yes, thank God. I thought it'd be late. It's a Christmas surprise. Terrific. Oh, thank you. Uh-huh. Thought you'd have a larger ship. I can't fit my belongings... We'll get your stuff there before you arrive. Don't you worry. Oh, captain. Yes. May I have a word with you? Hold on. Steve's mother is in the hibernation chamber. No kidding. She wanted her body in suspended animation until we reached Orion and she could get that tumor removed. Mm, yes. Great. So, do I have to wake her before we move her to the new ship? Given that she's in hibernation, do I really have to ask her permission? I'd hate to bother her. Plus, she is so slow-moving. It would be so much less of a headache if we could ship her in her storage unit with our stuff. No problem. Oh, fantastic. [SIGHS] You know, if it helps, my grandmother was in hibernation for five years. It doesn't. I realize that I should've checked with you first. Yeah. If it's a matter of care, I'd be happy to... I'm allergic. Oh. So... I just thought because of the gerbils that... Gerbils don't jump up on your lap or leave hair all over the place. Could we not mention this to Sunshine? Just keep it between us? Sure. [] TED: Hey. What are you watching? Home movies. Yeah. [INAUDIBLE DIALOGUE] DONNA: Well, I don't care. I'm offended. STEVE: They're having a Christmas party, otherwise they'd have one for us. This one? Fragile. It just pisses me off. When Charlotte and Stan left the ship I threw them a huge going-away party, right? Birthdays, anniversaries, I'm the one putting the whole goddamn thing together. I am done. Forget it. On the new ship, I am not lifting a finger for anyone. Good. You shouldn't have to. Thank you so much for helping me with this. I really appreciate it. You can't imagine the pod this guy brings. I had to cram everything in. There's no straps or protections for the breakables. No, no, hold on a second. Take this instead. Thank you. His mother. She looks nice. Mm. When she's asleep. Steve! What? Honey, there's no room. We can't fit her. We'll make room. DONNA: There's no room, honey. She's gonna have to come later with your sports equipment. Oh, darn. [SIGHS] Would you mind terribly taking care of all that? Of, um, uh... Yeah, sure. I mean, that would be my pleasure. No rush. Okay, now what can I get you for dessert? Sundae! Sundae! Okay. SHIP: Activating food service. You have chosen take out. Sundae. [SIGHS] Somebody ate them all again. How about I get you some rice pudding? Oh, let me check the freezer unit. Maybe there's an extra one hiding in here. Okay, let's see. What's that? Hmm? Oh. Oh, darn. I was hiding it from you. Okay. Promise you won't tell anyone. I got this for you for Christmas. But Jessica says she's allergic and can't have puppies running all over the ship. [] Excuse me, sir. I was hoping that we could discuss Daniel's chart. You gotta help me out here. I don't know how they talk to their superiors on space station Lorelei... Space station Lorelei, sir, is an impeccable place. We were competent, we were efficient... Yeah, I know. I've read all the records. It's not the point. Well, then you know that I am more than qualified for this job. I'm simply saying that if we have these graphs in front of us we might as well use them. I mean, I don't understand. To ignore them is... Sir, Daniel clearly spent a better part of his tenure here working on these. Sir, did you not respect Daniel? Did you not like him? [] Sir, why did Daniel leave? What did I tell you? Well, you said that he was promoted. Exactly. Exactly. He was promoted. All right, you know what? I want to settle this once and for all. There seems to be a little confusion about this Daniel thing. That's really not necessary. Attention all crew members. Hear ye, hear ye. Regarding Daniel's departure, which there seems to be a lot of confusion about. I want to tell you this once and for all, Daniel was promoted. Okay? Yeah, and also, I am given to believe there was some family emergency as well. So there you have it in black and white. Case closed. [GAS HISSING] [SIGHS] SHIP: Warning, airborne chemical detected in tank storage three. Now ventilating. Hey, Sunshine. What are you up to? Um, just talking to my mom about different things. It's not about you. It's about someone else. I have a little bit of free time if you want to go the arboretum with me. Um... No thanks. We could look at the bonsai tree like you like to do. You don't want to go? Well, is it, um, just that you don't want to go or you don't want to go with me? It's just because I don't want to go, for some reason. I don't know why, but I just don't really want to. Okay. I understand. Listen, it was really cool talking to you. [] [GASPS] [SOBBING QUIETLY] [COMPUTER BEEPS] SHIP: Attention crew, don't forget to vote for the new cafeteria wallpaper. Decision will be final at 1200 hours. [DOORBELL CHIMES] BOTH: We wish you a merry Christmas We wish you a merry Christmas We wish you... Very... That's very good. I'm a little busy right now. Please don't inhibit her creativity. BOTH: We wish you a merry Christmas And a happy New Year Merry Christmas! Okay. Come on. [] Hologram chamber on. DANIEL: Hold on one second. Let me come out. Sorry. [DANIEL CLEARS THROAT] I've... Glenn? Daniel. Uh, this is a bad time. You know, I could hologram later. I'm sorry. What is it, Glenn? Um, you look good. How are you? I'm great. You look great. So you're on the Nostradamus now. Yep. You found me. I guess you got that promotion. Yes, incredibly. Considering what happened. Right. Anyway... Also serving under Lawrence Wilson. Fantastic leader. Total role model. Uh, wait. Larry Wilson is the captain of the Nostradamus? You gotta be kidding me. He's actually an admiral now Yeah. And I believe he prefers "Lawrence." Well, I mean, you know, I've known him for years as Larry so... I know that one very well. Ahem. Not like that. I don't know him that well. Oh my God, it's okay to know a man well, Glenn. Reason for calling, um, besides saying hi, I just want to know if you happened to get this notice. What was it? Yeah, "You are required to report to 20 hours of therapy." I mean, over your little AWOL episode. Did you happen to get this too? This one? My little episode? My little episode, Glenn? Well, Daniel, you are the one that left. I left because you had to be drunk to make love to me then you sobbed in your pillow afterwards. I want to remind you that you have to be very careful about the way you talk about these things, um, especially in therapy because that... It's very delicate... Aye-aye, sir. And careers can be affected. Just... What? Is someone with you? No, no, no. I need to go. Was he there the whole time? You don't have to worry about... Who? Who was it? Was it Larry? Bye, Glenn. SHIP: End of tape. DANIEL: End of what? Nothing. Nothing. Were you recording this? You sad, pathetic... [] Hey. Hi. I got your message. What...? I, um, really need... Aah! Ow! Oh, God. Are you okay? Here, sit down. Sit down. Okay. Okay. Sorry it's so late. No. I just, um... I needed to talk to someone. Yeah. Do you ever...? Do you ever feel like you're just floating around in space and there's no one there? I mean, no one there to check you or... I don't know. I mean, there's no family or friends or... I don't know. Do you ever feel crazy? [OVER RECORDING] Glenn? GLENN: Daniel. Sorry. [TAPE REWINDING] No, no, no, I need to go. GLENN: Was he there the whole time? You don't have to worry about... GLENN: Well, Daniel, you are the one that left. DANIEL: I left because you had to be drunk to make love to me then you sobbed in your pillow... To make love to me, then you... To make love to me... I feel like we have so much in common. I do too. I mean, we're both these fractured people. You lost your hand in battle and I... I am... I have I... Yeah, um... I didn't... I didn't lose my hand in battle. I shot it off while cleaning a laser-refractor piston my first week of service. So... I don't care. I understand. I... [] [ROBOTIC HAND SERVOS WHIRRING] Ow. Sorry. Okay, let me... Ted. No, I have to... It's okay. Stay still. Ow. That hurts. Ow, Ted, make... Make it stop! I'm sorry. Oh, God. Get it off! Ow! Get it off! Ow! No, if I get it... You have to... Ow, ow, ow! Stop. Darn it! You had to... Yeah, do it like this. Oh, God. I'm... I am... Okay, well, I mean... My hand just... You know... It was my fault. No, no, it wasn't. It was my hand. No, no. Just got a little... I turned it on. I think I should go now. What? No, we... Can we? [SIGHS] I need you to make love to me, Glenn. I need you to make love to me, Glenn. I need you to make love to me, Glenn. I need you to make love to me, Glenn. I need you to make love to me, Glenn. [INCREASES VOLUME] I need you to make love to me, Glenn. I need you to make love to me, Glenn. I need you to make love to me, Glenn. I need you to make love to me, Glenn. I need you to make love to me, Glenn. I will. I need you to make love to me, Glenn. I will. I need you to make love to me, Glenn. I will. I need you to make love to me, Glenn. I need you to make love to me, Glenn. I will. I need you to make love to me, Glenn.

I need you to make love to me, Glenn. [] Hello, I am Dr. Bot. Hello. Searching voice database records. GLENN [ON RECORDING]: Hello. DR. BOT: Welcome, Lieutenant Glenn Terry. Actually, it's "captain" now. Updating file. Welcome, Captain Glenn Terry. Shall we take a voyage of discovery together? Why not? What problems inside of Captain Glenn would Captain Glenn like to work on? Just for the record, I have no problems inside of me at all. And this is new for me. This was not... Being open to change is the first step on the road to mental health. I just need you people to know that I'm not being hesitant. Hesitation often leads to revelation. Duly noted. I have noted it as well. That would be the "duly" part. That's the two of us. Correct. What are you thinking in the midst of this silence? Actually, I was thinking about smoking. Cigarettes contain carcinogens which may cause cancer in carbon-based life forms. Right. You are a carbon-based life form, therefore, cigarettes may cause cancer inside you. Thank you. You're welcome. Can I smoke? May I smoke here, please? Perhaps you'd like to try Valium? Smoking is kind of my Valium, so honest... They are two entirely different drugs. Nicotine is a stimulant. Valium is a sedative. Is it? Yes, it is. I was not aware of that. Captain Glenn, how have things been on the ship for you? Status quo. We're having a Christmas party for the people on the ship. Dr. Bot politely declines your invitation. It's humans only, so that's really a non-issue. Okay? Anyway, I'm supposed to be pretending that these people are my friends when... You have to be a friend to have a friend. They're not friends. They are colleagues. A friend in need is a friend indeed. Friend. Make new friends. Keep the old, for one is silver while the other one is gold. Gold. Remember the golden rule: "Do unto others as you would have them do unto you." Silver. Every cloud has a silver lining. [LAUGHS] Cigarette. Cigarettes contain carcinogens which may cause cancer in carbon-based life forms. You are a carbon-based life form, therefore cigarettes may cause cancer inside you. Hmm. [] You're gonna make us late for the party. Where were you? I was just finishing up some business. You ready? Yes. SHIP: Autopilot activated. [SIGHS] Hey, there he is. WOMAN: Donna. Hi, Susan. Oh. I thought you'd left. Can't pass up a Christmas party. Uh-huh. Well, enjoy. Hey. Hi. How are you? Good. How you doing? Could I get you something, or? Oh, um, I... Oh. Um... [CHUCKLES] I will have another. All right. Thank you. [OVER SPEAKERS] Jingle bells, jingle bells Jingle all the way Oh, what fun it is to ride In a one-horse open sleigh Hmm. There's no cake. There's a cake. Yeah, it is a Christmas cake. Have a drink, Donna. In a one-horse open sleigh He laughed as there I sprawling lie And quickly drove away Oh, jingle bells, jingle bells Jingle all the way Oh, what fun it is to ride In a one-horse open sleigh Oh, jingle bells, jingle bells Jingle all the way Oh, what fun it is to ride In a one-horse open sleigh You know, my mom... Heh-heh. My best... I'm sorry. What were you saying? My mom always had... This is really boring. Let's play a game. I thought we left Sunshine back in the capsule. [ALL CHUCKLE] Let's play a game. Come on. What kind of game do you want to play? Um... Okay, everybody goes around and tells a secret. Oh, I don't like secret games. I don't know about that. Yeah, I don't really have any secrets. Oh, I have a secret. I'm gonna get a beer really quick. Can you get me one too, please? Yeah. Oh, I want him to hear my secret. Ted, come back here please. We'd like to get this over with. We're going. Oh, no, honey, come on. I wanna play. I love games, but maybe charades. Something we can all play together. I'm leaving. You coming? Honey, you're being silly. What's wrong, Steve? It's just a game. Okay. [GIGGLES] [MUSIC STOPS] Okay. My secret is I have never had an orgasm. Um, I don't think that... Well, yeah, that really is probably more his secret. [CHUCKLES] Heh. That's good. No, that's a good one. That's... Yeah. You know what, we shouldn't... No, no, it's okay. It's okay. Good game, Misty. Yeah, you got everybody gathered around in here. Come on, anything else you want to say to me? Look at me! Look at me, please. You got something you wanna say, say it. I am ready to hear it. Whoa! Whoa! Whoa. GLENN: Ted, settle down. [] JESSICA: It's okay. She has a secret too. Don't. Misty. Why don't you tell everyone your secret. Look, let's not... Please, let's not play this game anymore. It's not funny. I know why you wanna stop. You know why? Because I don't like you. That's my secret. [LAUGHS] That's not a secret. I don't like you, either. Shut up, Misty. Ted, it's okay. Now, Ted, honestly, that is no way to talk to a lady. Yeah, you would know. Uh, yes, I would. You would know. Yeah. Ted, Ted, Ted. Does anybody ever wonder why she always has to act like a man? Stop. Let's stop now... Why she's always up on the bridge acting like a man. JESSICA: Stop. I would like to know that. Okay, Misty, drop this right now because it's really not funny. Maybe it's because she's not a real woman. Misty. Maybe she's not a real woman because she can't have... Stop it! Enough! Whoa! Okay, just back off. You don't need to scream at her. Sir, this is none of your business. It's none of my business? I'm just the captain of the ship. It's none of my business. That's perfect! I understand... I don't care if it's the main room, main bridge, rec room, playroom, toilet room, it's my business! I don't care if it's irrigation duct level fucking 7! It's my fucking business! Your attitude since you've shown up here has been to tell me what to do, how to do it, with a chip on your shoulder! Why can't you just be a woman? Why can't you just be a man?! What does that mean? Excuse me, forgive me, sir, but you are the last person I'd think would be demanding we should stick to conventions. I have no idea what you're talking about. Sir, you're gay! You are a gay man and we all know it. He's what? [TAPE REWINDING] JESSICA [ON RECORDING]: Sir, you're gay! You are a gay man and we all know it. Now, how could...? Uh, you can't know something... You can't... Like that. That's... Something like that is not... It's not true. Daniel and I were never... We are not together. We weren't together. There's... Ask him. He will tell you! I promise. I only stay with you because of Sunshine. Do you know that? Yeah. I know that. [CRASHING] [] SHIP: Alert. [ALARM BEEPING] Alert. Alert.
