I can't be stopped! Move! Let's go! Move! De Luca. What's going on? Listen. The thing they brought in here... Don't go near it. People change and they're all screwed up and acting lunic. Maybe we should call Sergeant Teller. What for? It's his project. He knows what's going on. This time I'm not gonna walk away and forget. Don't do anything stupid. Let's go! Let's go! Just like a twig, so brittle. How pathetic! Shoot the head! Clear! Clear. Shit man. It was the wire. You saw it. Jesus! This is just like Florida. One of the containers is missing sir. Well, we gotta locate it, because i intend to blow up every single one of them to hell. Shoot to kill. All units, shoot to kill. Shoot to kill. All units, shoot to kill. Aim for the head. Hey! Stop right there! We need more firepower. Bring it in. What the... Fire in the hole! What is immortality, but the need to be remembered? We throw around terms like family and love. when it comes to procreation, when in fact all we're doing... ...is to perpetuating the species. And generating instant immortality through our genes. We are so selfish to expect the next generation to love us, and fear us so that they feel in turn compel to continue the line. The patriarchal ideal of uninterrupted progeny. Is that what you read Emma? You sure know how to woo a girl Isaac. She said yes? You're dating Emma? Just give him my two cents. Don't pay attention to Jackie. He's just jealous. Have you done it? Have you? No. It's none of your business. You get out in a week. She still has two months to go. What are you gonna do? Come visit? Of course I'll come visit her. And you. And you too Donwynn. Get out of here! The moment I'm out that door, it's hasta la vista amigos. I mean no offense, but... There's nothing that can make me come back to this hell hole. Well, I kinda like spaghetti Wednesdays. They brainwashed you Sam. They give you spagetti to make you forget it's medication day. When you get out, I'll take you out for some real spaghetti. Hey Isaac, read some more. Read the part about statues. Ok. The depiction of one's physiognomy, face, bust, body, and a statutory form is the most immediate indication of triumph. What the next generation celebrates the appearance of a stone... indicates a direct link with the perpetuation of physical details... ...and hence, the genetic proof of family ties. When I get out, I'll make a bust... ...of Miss Barnet's tits. Why wait? Arts and crafts start again on Friday. Sam, that pair of ta-tas will live in my mind forever. Without the aid of a chisel. They are immortal. We're just in denial of death. So we invent ways to carry on. Because there's nothing after death. Right Donwynn? Don't ask me. - The prophet has spoken. - Don't call me that! Why does it always feel like we had this conversation before? I remember, because we had this conversation before. Death is not a bad thing. It's natural. Immortality just takes the edge off of it. Can we just change this subject? Oh great. Just add more junk to the site. Hey that's my area Jackie. A little rotten apple is not gonna make any difference, ok? What's gotten into you? Nothing. Sorry Jackie. I'll come visit you too. Are you having nightmares again? Just lay off the subject today, okay? Treasure. Treasure! Only you would've seen that in all that greenery. What's inside? Who cares? It's treasure. May I see it? What does it say? It's got a name and a number. De Luca, Dale. RMH346441. - Open it. - May I open it? The lid must be rusted and shut. I'm sure we can clean it up when we get back. You keep it. We'll open it tonight. Don't. Something bad is gonna happen if you do. Why is that Isaac? I don't know. I just know it's bad. You know what? For somebody who's supposed to be cured from supernatural fantasies, you sure know how to spook the shit out of the rest of us with your nonsense. He didn't mean it. He's just not good at the emotional stuff. Maybe I'm not cured. Maybe I need to stay another month. Emma will be fine. You need to get your life back in order. Hi Emma. Hi Emma. - Hi Emma. - Hi Emma. Hi Emma. - Hi Patty. - Hi Donwynn. Tonight? Tonight. Let's go girls. Move it. - Clean? - Woodsy. Let's go. Move it girls. Move it! I'm on break. Break's over when I say it's over. You understand? Emma. Don't you have a session to go to? In half an hour. - You need to curb that attitude miss. - Marshall we have a Code 12 in men's bathrooms, - dorm 2. - On my way. What an asshole! Nastier words come to mind. I'm going to be happy. No matter what, I'm gonna be happy. Are you sure you know what you're doing? Yeah, I've never been more sure. Isaac is perfect. You're dating a guy that's leaving in a week. I mean, does that sound sensible to you? Patty, love is not sensible. Probably just a crush. I'm walking on clouds. Darling, please spare us the cheesiness. Shut up! Vicky, mind your own business. You make it sound like you're losing your virginity. Yeah, right. Everybody knows you'll screw anyone for a penny. You got it wrong. Emma is a cutter. You're the junkie ho. And I don't see anyone offering you a penny for it. Fuck you! I wouldn't give you a penny either. She really thinks he'll be back to visit? They never do. Poor Emma, she'll probably be send back to suicide watch. Well, I guess we have to deal with the hard break next week, won't we? If you were her friend you'd do something about it. I feel centered. Although bad thoughts are still there, but... ...there's just a lot more light, so they can't sneak up on me. Good. What about missing time? Getting any of those feelings back? No. That really went pretty good. What about you? What about me? Well, won't you having a rough patch there with some of your crew? My crew? Oh. Isaac's been telling on me. No, he don't. - It doesn't get Isaac into any trouble? - No, no. No, I'm glad you're sharing in our adventures. We just get worked up about some pretty silly stuff sometimes. Guys are like that. Girls can be like that too. Anybody giving you any trouble at the dorm? If you don't want to talk about it, it's cool. No, it's not that. It's just... It's just not worth it. You the woman. I'm cured, aren't I? I think soon enough. - Well, Isaac's getting out on Friday. - Yes, he is. Listen, don't keep these feelings inside. If there's something you need to tell me, or Isaac... ...you should do it. Ok. Can I get you a coffee Donwynn? No, no more for me Ava, thanks. You okay? Sure. I would be better if Dr. Heller got off my back. - What's up? - You haven't heard? Well, he wants me to write a report every night... ...on my staff's extracurricular activities. What? Like soccer games and dinner? Yeah, that's our free, personal, private time Donwynn. It's none of his business. He can be a little obnoxious, but he's a good doctor. No, you're a good doctor. You care about your patients. I don't know if any other doctor that actually sleeps in the same quarters with his patients. To Dr. Heller it's all part of a project. You are a project. I am a project. They are a project. I just don't think his heart is in the right place. Oh shoot. I need to supervise Isaac's visit. Could you do me a favor? Please line the prescriptions up for me. I need to revise dosages for medication day. Oh, and Jackie may need a sleeping aid. Offer it to him, but it's ok if he doesn't want to take it. Sure thing. Ava, your heart is in the right place. I don't know what I would do without you. What have you done with my Frankenpunk? He's all drunk. He's more brain damaged than he already was. You stupid bitches have ruined everything. And what for? You must die. Can you keep it down? Hey Sam! The best part is coming up. - Hang on a second, I'm almost done. - Hurry up. Just press pause! I can't, it'll kill the suspense. - You people need to grow up. - Never. Fucking cubicles in this joint. - Frankenwhores. - Frankenwhores. Frankenwhores. Fucking morons. Nice crap you're watching. - What do you want? - You look like shit. Did you find anything out there today that I can sell on the Internet? No. What's wrong? What if when you leave you don't come back? I'll be back everyday. I want us to be together. Forever. What are you saying? - You want to think about it? - Yes. - You will? - Yes, I love you Isaac. Would you stop her from being such an idiot? Isaac and Emma are planning on having sex tonight. The rules say no sex. So go do your job! - Where? - Visitation room. You gotta stop them. He's no good for her. Marshall, we may have a 21 in visitation room. Fine. Go back to bed now. On my way. We'll continue our little conversation later. Where is Jackie? Bathroom. Guards the patient. Frankenwhore. I'll see you tomorrow. See you tomorrow. Hey. Did you think you can get away with that? Drop Isaac right now Marshall. Didn't see you there Doc. - You good Marshall? - Got under control. What did you think you were doing? The rules are real clear about patients having sex. What sex? This was a supervised visit. Supervised huh? I need to take Isaac back to his dorm, maybe you should escort Emma back. I will. Come on. It's alright. Come on. Come on Emma. Let's go. Come on. Come on. Come on. Let's go! Move! Okay viper, what did you do this time? Look, I'm not the problem. That crazy bitch is. I'll be back later. You are looking at the solitary cell Vicky. But I'm just trying to help. Marshall, can we see Isaac off to his dorm, because I'm scared for him. Yeah, I'm scared for him too. Especially after you go see the gynecologist tomorrow. Emma, he is not good for you. I'll help you. Security! Get her! Let go of me! Emma! Lover boy! Ask me no questions, I'll tell you no lies. Hey doc. - The green thermos, don't forget. - That's right. Let me take a look at it. What? It's gone. It's gone. It was right there. Where is Jackie? - Jackie is in the bathroom. - Don't let him open it. Jackie? Are you okay? I'll be out in a minute. Listen, Sam can't find his thermos. I was wondering if you've seen it. You know, the green one he found today? Thermos? Yeah, I was thinking that maybe if you had it by mistake... ...you'd leave it as you found it. What color did you say it was? Don't let him open it! Isaac! - What's that Donwynn? - I don't know. What's that? - What's that smell? - What smell? Smells like grapefruit. - Fuck, you had to play with it Jackie! - It's unbroken ok? We give it a wash, it's as good as new. I felt something strange back there, I felt like you were in danger. What's going on Isaac? Nothing is. You shouldn't have come in here. Well it's too late now. I'm here. Exactly. In here and not in their dorms. What kind of place are you supervising Dr. Donwynn? Marshall? Get everybody where they should be. Dr. Donwynn, in here. - Right now. - Dr. Heller, I... Right. I'm borrowing the other thing for a little while. Keep it. This is the one I like. Come on. Come on. Dr. Donwynn, I'm not a fan of your methods, but... ...I have to admit that progress has been made. In some of these cases. Although I'm not sure the end justifies the means. It's getting them to reorganize their thinking... ...to focus on their problems and solve them on their own. - By placing them in harm's way? - Calculated risk. Not that different than sending them to clean up the ravines. Physical activity promotes general well being. Why are you having them break rules deliberately? That's the point. They are not breaking them. They are given a choice and they are consistently making the right ones. Even the fastest deer will get hit by a car... ...when it has to cross the road too many times. - You are underestimating them. - And you may be overestimating them! You left the visitation room with your patients inside. Emma will get a full medical check tomorrow. - And I'd like to have a word with Isaac. - They did not break the rules. We'll let science decide. Good night. Lights out. Lights out. Lights out. Ravenside?! Sorry. I didn't mean to give you a heart attack. Just wanted to let you know that everything's back to normal, if normal exists. - Emma ok? - She'll be fine. She just got a little cough. Nothing serious. I'm making my famous pot roast on Saturday. What was that? Red wine goes well with it. You said about Saturday? I prefer Californian. Good night. Good night. Hi. My name is Donwynn. I work at Ravenside Memorial Hospital. I found a strange object with similar inscription. It's column shaped, about 5 inches long, ...half an inch across at the middle. Have you seen anything like this before? Did she just ask me out on a date? Damn he's strong! Did he have any attacks like this? He needs to be in a single cell. - What about restraints? - No, not necessary. Whatever you say doc. Jackie. Your skin's peeling. So is yours. My eyes. Gross. - Cool. - Donwynn, what's happening to us? I'm not sure. Seems to be an allergic reaction to something. Yeah, like maybe a poison. A snake poison. Why snake poison Boris? Because of the skin. The skin we were shedding like the snakes do. Oh man, aren't we a pretty picture. I'm going to get dressed. God damn. I'm not gonna miss breakfast. I'm not hungry. Speak for yourself sonny. You know what I'm in the mood for? Some really greasy sausages. I have to see Emma. She's probably feeling sick too. It's gotta be whatever was in that thing last night. She's probably at her medical. And you need to see Dr. Heller. He needs to sign your release papers. Why is Emma getting a medical? She just had one two weeks ago. It has nothing to do with me Isaac. You know I trust you. Don't read too much into it, ok? - Donwynn, it's-- - Listen. I'm going to help you guys no matter what. Go get dressed. Alright Emma. I'll be back in a few moments. Try to relax. Deep breathing. I'll only be a minute. Hello. That was fast. Just being a good girl, not Emma I see. Naughty Emma. What are you doing here? Get out! Reports don't lie. And once the doc reads it, it's gonna be another month for you and your little boyfriend in solitary. Plus, all the adoption papers you have to fill out. You didn't think they'll let you keep it, did you? We didn't do anything wrong. Maybe. Just maybe, you can help me induce the report. You can hide it till then. You'll be out in two months. Come on Emma. What do you say baby? Come on. Any information? No, please don't put me--- Stay away from me! What's going on? I need a fucking doctor. Jesus! Funny. I feel hungry. What the hell is going on doctor? Two days ago my hospital was as quiet as a morgue. But now I'm getting a crisis a second. What's happening in Dormitory 1? I'm not sure I understand what you mean. Maybe you should read this. So much for underestimating your patients. She's pregnant? Your responsibility... ...is to all my patients. Not just your select few. Maybe if you stopped playing matchmaker, you'd see that what they really need... ...is order and discipline. I can't release Isaac under these circumstances. Dr. Heller, this is entirely my fault. I may have led them... No, actually I know that I led them to think that it's ok to get intimate. So you lied to me. Yes. Yes I did, Doctor. They're getting married. One wrong does not undo another wrong. What will their life be like... ...if we let them go out there thinking they are cured? Your project to bring together a suicidal patient and a necrofobic... It is fascinating on paper. They should cancel each other, right They are not a project. You let me deal with them from now on. I'm confining Isaac to his dorm. Emma will stay in solitary until the rest of the tests come back. They don't deserve this. You're being to harsh on them. Not as harsh as I'm going to be with you doctor. I gave you time to explore your ideas. Now, we go back to tried and true methods. You move back to your doctor's parties tomorrow. Were you at the ravine yesterday? Like every Tuesday. You look a little pale. - Pick up a cold? - Maybe a mild one. What about your patients? Are they also sick? No, they're feeling much better today. One epileptic attack with chickenpox. Two food poisonings, a viral in origin. Peeling skin. Varicosed veins on the face... Where exactly were you? The left road ravine. By the well. The DeLuca Ravine. DeLuca? I've never heard it called that before. Maybe you and your patients should stay at your dorm until you're really better. Don't want anybody come down with a flu. And doctor? I expect you to wear your coat from now on. Yes, doctor. I feel strange. Me too. I'm still pretty? You're monster pretty. You know what I think? I think we're morphing. Why would you say that? Look. I don't bleed. See? Look at your arm. We're changing. Butterflies. Yeah. - Back to your room. - I have permission to-- Your privileges have been revoked. Without eyes to see, and ears to hear... Right where it should have been. - U.S.D.H.S. - General Teller please. Please hold. Sorry sir, he must have hung up. Trace that call. Right here Doc. Get him. Get him. Come on Sam. - I had a thing. - I know. - I'm better now. - I know you are. Come on. Hold the door. The painkillers aren't working. It's like he doesn't know who we are. The staph infection is eating away his skin. Nobody enters or leaves the building. We're under quarantine. From now on, I'm the only one allowed in this corridor. Permission to bear arms granted. If any patient from Donwynn tries to attack here, shoot him. I'll keep them loaded. Aim for the head. That's not true. Nothing like that ever happened. There's no shame in it. It's a good thing. Just not allowed by this place's rules. I know that! We know that! You gave us your trust, we would never do anything to violate that. It could be a false positive. Then that's what it is. It is almost certain, that by controlling the female... ...the father of the family can ensure the survival of his lineage. Sometimes through controlling and gentleness, but mostly, through violence. A women's fidelity guarentees the immortality... ...of a family's genetic material. Modern research has determined... ...that there is a direct line of DNA that runs through humanity. Linking all who come from. The mitochondrial DNA. The mother's genetic code. Ironically no such lineage exists for males. All these gorgeous babes on that lonely planet, and no guys. - It was heaven for the astronaut. - A Travel to Mars. Yes, yes. Many scientists believe that this DNA line... ...leads all the way back to the first human female. - Whom they call, Eve. - Okay, okay, my turn. She was 50 feet tall-- Attack of the 50 Foot Woman. How do you know? - You're cheating. - I don't think so. You have to do a little better than that Sam. Okay... How are you feeling Doc? Peachy. How about yourself? Odd. Yeah. A little sleep will cure anything. I'm not tired at all. I'm... I'm sorry about last night. I just... I wanted to prove that there's nothing wrong with opening the thermos. I guess there was, wasn't it? Jackie. If you haven't opened it, I would have. - So how sick are we? - I don't know. When do you think they'll let us out again? Because I want to check on my tomatoes. In a couple of days, I'm sure. What are they up to? Same shit. Boris and Sam are at their stupid fucking game and... ...Isaac's reading from his book. Listen Jackie, there may be a few changes later in the week. Yeah well I want Isaac's cubicle soon as he's out of here. Yeah, um, whatever happens remember, I'm on your side. If you say so Doc. Excuse me for a sec, would you Jackie? Hi Donwynn, I'm Jerry. If what you found looks anything like this, do not open it. I repeat, do not open it. One of these went missing in 1968. According to my source it contains some sort of infectious agent, that affects the DNA with very unpredictable results. My source tells me that anyone exposed to this... ...is immediately searched and destroyed by the government. Look, hang in there. I'll be in Ravenside tomorrow afternoon. Don't tell anyone you have it. Don't sell it to anyone. Bye for now. And of course it just gets better and better. Tonight we sleep. Tonight we sleep. Tonight we sleep. Tonight we sleep. Tonight we sleep. Tonight we sleep. I'm cured, I don't need this crap. No! Here we go Charlie. Come on buddy. Come on. How are you doing baby girl? It must be tough without your friend, huh? Don't call me that. Some girls are just like that baby girl. Always thinking with their pussy. Oh, thanks Ava. All the exits are locked. Dr. Heller's armed the personel. Armed? He doesn't want anybody leaving the quarantine area which means the entire building. I saw Marshall last night. He's nothing like he was. He is a mass of raw muscle and nerves and... It's the flesh eating virus. The bite got infected. Something to do with her saliva. Come to think of it, you guys don't look so hot either. I'm glad she's back in solitary. Stay away from me bitch! It's quite common actually. About the bite. Our mouths are cesspools for bacteria. I've never heard of warranting a quarantine. The way our patients interact... ...could lead to a greater spread of the bacteria. Stay sharp Ava. And stay away from Marshall. Is... Cabernet okay? I prefer Bouchelet. The sooner you admit you'll never gonna be cured like Emma, the better off you'll be. Please, baby girl. She'll never give you the time of day either. I don't think she's into kissing toads like you. You ladies, cut it out. What? No solitary? Go Vicky. Another medication day goes by without a hit. Ladies! Fucking bitch! I'll kill you! Okay ladies, it's over! We should do something about that before she starts to get suspicious. You heard that they were armed. - Wow. - What? I'm just a doctor doing his rounds. - Hey, what about-- - We can worry about the tomatoes later. Relax people. I'll be right back. Could you check on Emma? Please? Sam. Keep it safe. - Get away bitch! - Ladies. Alright ladies. - I hate you! - I'll kill you! Hi Maxine, what's up? The usual. - What happened to you? - Hi Pete. - I hate you! - Bitch. Get off me. Clean? Dead. Dead. Dead. - Dead. - No Pete, it's okay. - It's okay. - Dead. We're gonna need security down the break room. Copy that. Doctor Heller, there's a situation in the medication room. Permission to administer sedatives. - Permission granted. - Copy that. Doctor says to go ahead. This area is closed up. I have a patient I need to check on. Frank! It can wait. - Stop. - I need to see my friend Emma. Go back to your room. But... you don't understand. She needs me. She's my friend. I have orders to shoot. Please go back to your room. I want you to understand that she needs me. - They're going tu burn us alive. - Would you shut up already? I'm trying to think. - It's a first. - They always kill those who have the alien virus. - Right Boris? - It came from Planet B, 1956. Aliens. They can be a problem. Ok, let's just look at the facts. We're changing. - Understatement. - We can't eat, can't sleep. - We don't bleed. - We can't sleep. - We have new nails. - And new skin. We feel each other's pain. We're inside each other's heads. Tell us something we don't already know. I haven't had my medication today. Gregory. Don't push it! Have my money. You know what? I'm tired of your conspiracies. And your stupid fucking games. You're crazy. Not me. I'm here because I have bad temper, so don't give me any of your "I'm better than you" bullshit. I'm not a freak. - I've never hurt anyone in my life. - Hey! If you two don't stop fighting we'll all getting black and blue. So funny. Okay, you made your point. - Then let's get out of here. - Donwynn said to stay. You know, as crazy as it is, Sam is right. The moment they find us, we'll become scientific projects. Donwynn can't protect us this time. Security, we have a situation within the medication room. Please respond. Security team one responding. Come on, let's go. What am I going to do Marshall? I'm risking everything here... ...to see where this leads. I guess the infection differs from each experienced individual. You're probably at the end of a vegetative spectrum. Emma. Emma! Emma. To cure or not to cure you Marshall? Imagine the power this little key holds. But we can't waste it on you. You are too far gone. I'm afraid it is already time for you, Marshall. I'll arrange your trip to the-- Come on. No! I'll find Isaac. Emma! Let's go. Emma! You were my best friend. In the pursuit of immortality... ...we often ignored the very act of dying. How often did we remember a beautiful birth... ...over a tragic death? A touching goodbye, a twist of fate. A series of coincidences. A sweetheart's last kiss. A broken heart. Perpetuating one's memory... ...may simply lie in the manner of one's passing. Isaac. You're not dead. I can hear you. I don't feel anything. - Get up. - I don't feel anything. Doctor Heller, please come in. What is that stuck on the window? We're not supposed to open this door. No matter what. There's noone in there. Hi, I'm Jerry. I'm here to see Donwynn. He's on his way. Excuse us. Please wait right here. You stupid bitch. Watch me run. Maybe if you haven't taken all those drugs. I have the same mark. Never seen anything like this. - We've seen it all. - I've seen it all. But not like this. You shouldn't be alive. Look, it didn't kill me, it won't kill you either. Look at your chest for pete's sake. This is better than Resurrector, the '62 version. We can't be killed. That's bullshit. We're dead. Don't you get it? Dead! Cut the death crap. It's bad enough you keep ranting on about that stupid book you keep reading from. He's right. You are dead. By human standards anyway. I guess you opened the vial. It contains a recombinant virus. It takes your DNA, and deconstructs it and reshapes it. The results can be phenomenal. Super human-like. Or hellish. I guess it's safe to say we've past the reconstruction phase. Not really. It developes at the same speed as your bodies' individual metabolism to take it. That much is known. You guys are just at the larva stage. You have no idea. This could be the beginning of the ultimate contagium. The coming plague. - Enlighten us. - Please don't hurt him. - Maybe we're still contagious. - I don't like him. You are. You're very contagious. The candy store. Shit. Damn it! Alright here and here, we got these sealed off. Sir, I have a clear connection. Should we call the police? I think we should. What, bother them over a patient gone haywire? That's our job description. Keep your eyes open. Let's go. You smell like shit. Okay, listen up everybody. We need you to go to your dorms right away. And stay there. We have a situation. Let's go! Go now! - Come on. - Now. Yeah, De Luca. This was my dad's. His body was never found. They say it was his fault the research building burned down. It's not true. My dad was a good man. This place was a hush-hush military installation... ...running on a research grant. It started back west, in another base. The Soviet spy plane crashed in the desert, and they transported the debris to a base nearby. Only the pilot, a man called Rubinsky survived. Among the rescued items were these little things. They debriefed Rubinsky on these containers, but he seemed as ignorant about the origins as the scientists were. No, no, no, no. Not Soviet. American make. American make. American make. Somehow, the vial opened. And he was exposed to whatever was inside. His captors knew immediately what had happened, and decided it was too risky to keep it in a nuclear facility. So he was brought here. To the research building. Right out where the greenhouse is now. He was put in isolation. He came down with the flu. Then his skin peeled. He had hives too. Then he lost his appetite and didn't want to sleep either. The doctors could not explain it. All tests came back that he was dead. No vital signs, no reflexes, but there he was, thinking, and talking, and moving and being his nice self. - Hey, check this out. - Until he tasted flesh. Human flesh. What do you think? Nice gal huh? After that he started to evolve into something so horrifying... ...the doctors decided to put him down. Expect how do you kill something that's dead already? The are all dead. No they're not. Dr. Heller is still in. Stay down. When he bit the orderly, he passed on the infection. While Rubinsky could think and feel, this new creature had little control over his speech and thought process. My God. He can't be killed. It was a virus replicating machine... ...infecting all he bit, all he touched. The contagium was irreversible. Within 24 hours, the living dead rose from the carnage. But they stopped them, didn't they? How? You said they were already dead. While they were looking for an antiviral, they discovered that the virus needed full control... ...of the motor and autonomic functions. The solution was far simpler than they had anticipated. Isaac, come on. Isaac. Doctor Tollbridge told me I was pregnant. That's impossible Isaac. The contagium, it must have... I'm scared. What's happening to us? We got a patient down outside. Dorm 1. Come on, let's go. Should we call for backup? I don't know where to begin to look to find out how to stop the process. He was about to tell me. Okay, so... His father worked at this facility and gets the blame for the fire. In the meantime there is no indication of what kind of research they were even doing here. Except for what Jerry said. What is that? - A 1965 Buick. - No, the place. That's the ravine we were clearing. It is. Dr. Heller called it the DeLuca Ravine. He's known all along. Shit. Can you hear their thoughts? Not anymore. It's like the signal has disconnected. - Come on guys, it's only us. - Your friends. We come in peace. Take us to your leader. You don't know what you're missing. You'll come around. You wait and see. You need it. Hi Emma. He may be right. We'll fight it. It's like Jerry said. The virus is replicated. It's taking over everyone. - Donwynn! - Ava! They dragged all my men in there. They were pulling the heart like string cheese. - It started this morning. - What the fuck's gotten into them? - We can't let them out! - This isn't going to stop them. What's wrong with you? What the hell are you? Don't waste your bullets on us. You'll need every single one of them to stay alive. Too late. Get out of here. Go! Come on. Emma. Quickly, let's go! Let's go! Son of a bitch. Stay behind me. Stay close. I always hated your food. Let's go, come on. Quick! I've never seen anything like this. Guys, you gotta try to remember what else did Jerry say. How do we stop them? It wasn't the fire. That much I'm sure he said. He said they were looking for some kind of antiviral. - Viral? - What? That shit is contagious?

Inject directly into the me... What does "me" mean? Ava, what stars with "me"? - You're the doctor! - I'm not feeling myself right now! Right. Me. Me. - Into the medication? - No. I think it has something to do with the anatomy. God! What are you doing? You are one of us. We're one little family. Why would you want to harm us like this? Why? Don't get it. They just don't get it. Give me some meat. Dr. Donwynn, we're friends. Remember! It is the medulla. Inject directly into the medulla within an hour of exposure. The medulla, the base of the head. Base of the head. Like you said. These can't break our bones Donwynn. Keep a little, he's almost here. First in line Emma. We are one family. No! You want it?
