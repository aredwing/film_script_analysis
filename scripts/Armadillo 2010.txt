Is it still relevant for us Danes? 3 00:01:34,880 -- 00:01:39,799 These are obvious questions that you may be asking yourselves. 4 00:01:39,960 -- 00:01:43,559 Your predecessors in Helmand have pushed forward - 5 00:01:43,720 -- 00:01:47,639 - and made a huge effort in aid of a civilian population - 6 00:01:47,800 -- 00:01:51,439 - that has lived under miserable conditions. 7 00:01:51,600 -- 00:01:57,119 For this, several of our colleagues have paid a high price. 8 00:01:57,280 -- 00:02:01,159 It's your duty to continue unhesitatingly in their footsteps - 9 00:02:01,320 -- 00:02:05,839 - now that your government has charted its political course. 10 00:02:26,480 -- 00:02:29,759 - Yes. - when are you going to Jutland? 11 00:02:29,920 -- 00:02:35,359 To Jutland?

I just don't get it. 17 00:03:23,640 -- 00:03:26,679 You could say it's like football. 18 00:03:26,840 -- 00:03:30,679 You learn so and so much through practice - 19 00:03:30,840 -- 00:03:35,999 - but you learn more by playing matches. 20 00:03:36,400 -- 00:03:41,879 - You also enjoy the comradeship. - Of course. That's part of it. 21 00:03:42,040 -- 00:03:48,519 - It's a challenge and an adventure ... - And that's what hurts! 22 00:03:48,680 -- 00:03:53,799 - An adventure? I can't ... - But I want the experience. 23 00:04:55,400 -- 00:04:59,079 what's up? Did you get home, or what? 24 00:05:00,320 -- 00:05:03,039 No ...

It wasn't boring. 54 00:09:21,040 -- 00:09:25,879 The Taliban are much more on their toes than I had thought. 55 00:09:26,040 -- 00:09:32,479 They are just 800 m away from Armadillo and on the ball. 56 00:09:32,640 -- 00:09:39,319 - So we'll confront them fairly soon. - It's good there's work for us. 57 00:09:39,480 -- 00:09:45,879 You can count on some action. I promise it'll be interesting. 58 00:09:47,840 -- 00:09:51,199 Six months without women. 59 00:09:51,360 -- 00:09:54,959 - You're awfully cheerful. - After a long night. 60 00:09:57,600 -- 00:10:00,799 - You have M&Ms? - Hands off.

Grab some water. I have a few pointers. 65 00:10:31,120 -- 00:10:35,719 Gun line is shooting. That's why it's so noisy. 66 00:10:35,880 -- 00:10:40,599 If you hear what sounds like a rocket, it's the launchers firing. 67 00:10:40,760 -- 00:10:43,839 It's fired at any time of the day. 68 00:10:44,000 -- 00:10:47,319 There was one. That's normal. 69 00:10:47,480 -- 00:10:50,159 Here are the shower containers. 70 00:10:52,240 -- 00:10:55,679 That's the Green Zone. Observe as much as possible. 71 00:10:55,840 -- 00:10:59,159 when there's combat, you're obviously more exposed - 72 00:10:59,320 -- 00:11:02,159 - so don't just stand there staring. 73 00:11:02,320 -- 00:11:06,719 "walk-ins" stop just over there and call for an interpreter. 74 00:11:06,880 -- 00:11:10,879 It doesn't take long to figure out if they're dicking around - 75 00:11:11,040 -- 00:11:13,279 - or if it's something useful. 76 00:11:19,200 -- 00:11:22,279 - You had some questions. - Yes. 77 00:11:22,440 -- 00:11:27,679 How far north from Armadillo can we go - 78 00:11:27,840 -- 00:11:30,679 - before the Taliban get active? 79 00:11:30,840 -- 00:11:34,359 About 800-1000 m north of Armadillo. 80 00:11:34,520 -- 00:11:38,959 From up here we can draw a line almost up to the Helmand River. 81 00:11:39,120 -- 00:11:43,279 This area here is basically ours. 82 00:11:43,440 -- 00:11:47,759 His objective is to move south and isolate us so we can't get out - 83 00:11:47,920 -- 00:11:53,519 - and to diminish our influence on the locals. That's what he wants to do. 84 00:11:53,680 -- 00:12:00,759 Our patrolling forces him to meet us here and fight in this narrow pass. 85 00:12:00,920 -- 00:12:05,679 These people are former mujahedeen and used to fight the Russians - 86 00:12:05,840 -- 00:12:11,959 - in the exact same area, so they're used to fighting a superior force. 87 00:12:12,120 -- 00:12:16,879 They're not afraid. Ten men might attack forty. 88 00:12:17,040 -- 00:12:21,559 Being outnumbered doesn't stop them. Not at all. 89 00:12:21,720 -- 00:12:24,599 - They've got big balls - That's for sure. 90 00:12:24,760 -- 00:12:30,119 Did you treat the ones who were killed and wounded in December? 91 00:12:30,280 -- 00:12:36,679 Unfortunately me and J were the ones who found the dead on 1 2. 19. 92 00:12:36,840 -- 00:12:41,399 we were first on the spot. I grabbed a detector and started sweeping. 93 00:12:41,560 -- 00:12:48,199 As we went around the vehicle, the fucking beam from my headlamp - 94 00:12:48,360 -- 00:12:54,239 - caught this guy right in his face. He was staring, but dead, of course. 95 00:12:54,400 -- 00:12:58,319 I closed his eyes and covered up his face. 96 00:12:58,480 -- 00:13:01,519 And the last guy ... There wasn't much left of him. 97 00:13:01,680 -- 00:13:05,759 I collected body parts for six hours. Everything. 98 00:13:05,960 -- 00:13:11,679 Fingers, a hand in a glove, a knee joint, a heart lying around ... 99 00:13:11,840 -- 00:13:15,759 It's hard to describe what it looks like in a place like that. 100 00:13:15,920 -- 00:13:18,919 You also have to keep an eye on yourself. 101 00:13:19,080 -- 00:13:24,279 You're not wacko, just because you laugh at some irrelevant stuff. 102 00:13:24,440 -- 00:13:29,399 You need normality, 'cause this is so meaningless that you can't grasp it. 103 00:13:31,480 -- 00:13:34,159 - Susanne speaking. - Hi, it's Mads. 104 00:13:34,320 -- 00:13:38,799 Hi, Mads. I was hoping it was you. 105 00:13:38,960 -- 00:13:43,279 - How are you? - Fine. How about you? 106 00:13:43,440 -- 00:13:46,239 That's much more interesting. 107 00:13:46,400 -- 00:13:51,519 - I'm fine. we're in Armadillo. - Okay. 108 00:13:52,680 -- 00:13:57,919 - What's Dad up to? - He sitting right here. 109 00:13:58,080 -- 00:14:01,439 I'll let you talk to him. 110 00:14:04,640 -- 00:14:08,599 - Hi, Mads. - Hi, Dad. How are you? 111 00:14:08,760 -- 00:14:11,399 We're fine, Mads. 112 00:14:11,560 -- 00:14:17,879 But yesterday your mother had a fright - 113 00:14:18,040 -- 00:14:22,759 - when the phone rang in the middle of the night. 114 00:14:22,920 -- 00:14:29,599 I didn't hear it, but she did. It scared the daylights out of her. 115 00:14:29,760 -- 00:14:35,559 Your first thought is that something terrible has happened. 116 00:14:35,720 -- 00:14:42,439 But it was a business call from India about something they're printing - 117 00:14:42,600 -- 00:14:46,239 - and they forgot about the time difference. 118 00:14:53,480 -- 00:14:58,439 Since we left Denmark, the enemy's objective hasn't changed. 119 00:14:58,600 -- 00:15:03,759 The Taliban's objective is to destabilize security in Helmand - 120 00:15:03,920 -- 00:15:08,159 - and undermine the locals' trust in the ISAF forces. 121 00:15:09,840 -- 00:15:14,999 It's important to get into Haftaran and Athakhan - 122 00:15:15,160 -- 00:15:20,399 - to establish contact with the people. when you eat your field rations - 123 00:15:20,560 -- 00:15:24,079 - and there's something you don't like - 124 00:15:24,240 -- 00:15:27,639 - I suggest you save it and bring it on patrol. 125 00:15:27,800 -- 00:15:33,119 Give it to the children as a sign of goodwill. 126 00:15:33,960 -- 00:15:35,679 Rules of engagement. 127 00:15:35,840 -- 00:15:39,639 Remember that self defense can apply prior to being fired upon. 128 00:15:39,800 -- 00:15:46,279 Such as by confirmed weapons or people moving into a position to fire. 129 00:15:47,120 -- 00:15:50,079 Yes. Go get ready. 130 00:15:50,240 -- 00:15:57,439 Listen up. Line up, so 6-5 can take our picture before our first patrol. 131 00:16:58,840 -- 00:17:01,719 I don't have anything. 132 00:17:23,520 -- 00:17:26,839 I can see why the wadis are dangerous. 133 00:17:27,000 -- 00:17:32,959 They can easily hide an IED. The thought is sickening. 134 00:17:33,120 -- 00:17:38,079 We're most likely to go around it - 135 00:17:38,240 -- 00:17:41,199 - so it would be stupid to put one here. 136 00:17:48,400 -- 00:17:52,319 905, I saw a man run through the fence on the eastern side - 137 00:17:52,480 -- 00:17:59,479 - of the row of bushes that run from north to south. 138 00:18:22,880 -- 00:18:25,359 Welcome to Nam. 139 00:18:26,960 -- 00:18:31,279 - Hey, interpreter! - Follow me. Come. 140 00:18:31,440 -- 00:18:36,039 Hayatullah, hurry. Don't let them onto the poppy field. 141 00:18:36,200 -- 00:18:42,519 This way. Not in the field. I will show you. 142 00:18:43,880 -- 00:18:50,399 9-0 here. Civilians are showing us the route around the field. 143 00:19:08,240 -- 00:19:10,719 Salaam aleikum. 144 00:19:10,880 -- 00:19:14,679 How are you? Alright? 145 00:19:14,840 -- 00:19:19,359 - Read your book. - Are you reading? Yes. 146 00:19:21,240 -- 00:19:25,119 - It's a madrassa. - Are you studying the Koran? 147 00:19:25,280 -- 00:19:28,919 - Have things been calm? - How is the situation in the area? 148 00:19:29,080 -- 00:19:33,119 - Calm? - No, where is it safe? 149 00:19:33,280 -- 00:19:39,079 - Are the Taliban in the area? - They've taken the whole area. 150 00:19:39,240 -- 00:19:42,319 How could you not know? They're everywhere. 151 00:19:42,480 -- 00:19:45,599 Tell us if you see anything. 152 00:19:45,760 -- 00:19:48,999 So we can get them out of the area. 153 00:19:49,160 -- 00:19:51,759 we cannot cooperate with you. 154 00:19:51,920 -- 00:19:56,399 You come with all your weapons, and then you leave. 155 00:19:56,560 -- 00:20:00,479 We're staying here, and then the Taliban will come after us. 156 00:20:00,640 -- 00:20:04,839 But if you don't cooperate, we cannot secure the area - 157 00:20:05,000 -- 00:20:08,559 - and then we can't build a school for your kids. 158 00:20:12,880 -- 00:20:17,879 You have guns, they have guns. If I talk, they'll cut my throat. 159 00:20:31,840 -- 00:20:35,799 - First patrol reporting! - Look at my back! 160 00:20:37,640 -- 00:20:40,279 Look cool, man! 161 00:20:43,520 -- 00:20:45,759 Just a sec. 162 00:20:46,720 -- 00:20:49,519 First patrol reporting. 163 00:20:49,680 -- 00:20:53,919 It didn't feel like anything. Not really. 164 00:20:55,760 -- 00:20:59,279 I probably will, when we get into the shooting. 165 00:20:59,440 -- 00:21:03,879 But this is also part of it. It's not all fighting. 166 00:21:04,040 -- 00:21:08,599 Right, we're also here to help these poor people. 167 00:21:08,760 -- 00:21:13,639 It's like going to the fun fair without trying the rollercoasters. 168 00:21:15,680 -- 00:21:18,319 Alright, let's start the debriefing. 169 00:21:18,480 -- 00:21:21,159 The patrol itself. How did it go? 170 00:21:24,560 -- 00:21:29,559 Individual skills really sucked. Seriously. 171 00:21:29,720 -- 00:21:33,519 How many fell to their knees on short stops? 172 00:21:36,280 -- 00:21:39,359 So, eight men out of 50. 173 00:21:39,520 -- 00:21:42,599 Do we agree that this has to be improved? 174 00:21:42,760 -- 00:21:48,919 Get into the habit now. Get your fat ass down on its knees - 175 00:21:49,080 -- 00:21:52,839 - because at some point if you don't, then pow! 176 00:21:53,000 -- 00:21:57,959 So kneel, damn it! Right. Anything else? 177 00:21:58,120 -- 00:22:03,679 I think I ought to say what I got out of this patrol. And it wasn't a lot. 178 00:22:03,840 -- 00:22:07,159 Remember this is an agricultural area. 179 00:22:07,320 -- 00:22:12,079 The peasants have just sown their wheat.

Yes .. .? 733 01:27:33,240 -- 01:27:38,759 If I had listened to our debriefing and the sequence of events - 734 01:27:38,920 -- 01:27:43,959 - I would have thought it was extremely ... delicate. 735 01:27:44,120 -- 01:27:50,399 I could understand if outsiders, who weren't there got that impression. 736 01:27:50,560 -- 01:27:53,319 We were still on a high afterwards. 737 01:27:53,480 -- 01:27:56,759 You have to take that into consideration. 738 01:27:56,920 -- 01:28:00,479 It was an extreme experience, so we used extreme words. 739 01:28:00,640 -- 01:28:06,119 If the press makes a case of this, and people think we're psychos - 740 01:28:06,280 -- 01:28:11,079 - well, let them think so. They weren't there, they didn't see it. 741 01:28:11,240 -- 01:28:17,119 They weren't there, but we know what happened. 742 01:28:17,280 -- 01:28:20,319 Let them talk. They weren't there. 743 01:28:20,480 -- 01:28:23,719 If they make a case out of this, we'll be suspended - 744 01:28:23,880 -- 01:28:28,679 - and then we'll be blowing bubbles, and that's it until we go home. 745 01:28:28,840 -- 01:28:35,079 And we'll go down in military history, apart from those who knew us - 746 01:28:35,240 -- 01:28:40,799 - as the guys who fucked up. Anyone who's named in this case - 747 01:28:40,960 -- 01:28:43,799 - including myself, Daniel and Signaler - 748 01:28:43,960 -- 01:28:49,879 - can look forward to a long session with the whole military circus. 749 01:28:50,040 -- 01:28:54,439 I can't say: "You weren't there, man" to that. 750 01:28:54,600 -- 01:28:59,679 I believe that Signaler and Daniel had the balls to do the right thing - 751 01:28:59,840 -- 01:29:02,479 - at the right time. 752 01:29:02,640 -- 01:29:06,359 To proceed the way they did with two wounded, one near miss - 753 01:29:06,520 -- 01:29:10,159 - and three men with holes in their uniform and so on ... 754 01:29:10,320 -- 01:29:15,199 To walk up and shoot ... Had I seen movement, I would have fired, too. 755 01:29:15,360 -- 01:29:20,839 And it only took Daniel or Signaler to point under the log and say: 756 01:29:21,000 -- 01:29:22,879 "One here, one there." 757 01:29:23,040 -- 01:29:26,639 That was enough for me to flip to automatic and shoot. 758 01:29:26,800 -- 01:29:31,319 I didn't feel like sticking my head down to someone with a gun. 759 01:29:31,480 -- 01:29:34,999 And yes, it was touch and go. 760 01:29:35,160 -- 01:29:42,039 But in my world you do what you do. If you have the strength not to shoot - 761 01:29:42,200 -- 01:29:45,959 - because you realise that the movement is not that of a weapon - 762 01:29:46,120 -- 01:29:51,199 - but a surrender or whatever . .. If you have the strength to realise this - 763 01:29:51,360 -- 01:29:55,639 - you don't shoot, of course, but had I been there - 764 01:29:55,800 -- 01:30:00,039 - I would also have fired, and I did fire, because I wasn't sure. 765 01:30:00,200 -- 01:30:02,319 That was enough for me. 766 01:30:22,520 -- 01:30:29,159 I think it's hard for people at home to understand how ... 767 01:30:29,320 -- 01:30:35,679 - How the decision is made? - How you can just take a life. 768 01:30:35,840 -- 01:30:40,159 You have to be here to understand it. 769 01:30:40,320 -- 01:30:44,959 This place is whacked, after all. It's a fucked-up country. 770 01:30:45,120 -- 01:30:47,319 No doubt about it. 771 01:30:47,480 -- 01:30:51,559 People who understand the war itself - 772 01:30:51,720 -- 01:30:55,439 - and how you and I and others feel about being here - 773 01:30:55,600 -- 01:30:59,799 - and making a difference, those people will understand us. 774 01:30:59,960 -- 01:31:05,759 Outsiders might sneer and say that we're insane - 775 01:31:05,920 -- 01:31:09,599 - or that we did something terrible. 776 01:31:12,320 -- 01:31:15,119 I know I did the right thing. 777 01:31:15,280 -- 01:31:19,079 I know we all did the right thing. 778 01:31:52,840 -- 01:31:57,039 In case you don't know, I was questioned by MPs this morning - 779 01:31:57,200 -- 01:32:02,239 - regarding our case with the snitch. So far it's 'a matter of rumor' - 780 01:32:02,400 -- 01:32:08,159 - which they'll try to quash at battalion level. 781 01:32:08,320 -- 01:32:13,719 So if you hear anything, then dismiss it as a rumor - 782 01:32:13,880 -- 01:32:18,639 - because that's what it is. So it's just a lot of hot air. 783 01:32:18,800 -- 01:32:22,119 It may come back to haunt us - 784 01:32:22,280 -- 01:32:26,519 - but it is a lot of hot air without any truth in it. 785 01:32:27,400 -- 01:32:30,319 Alright? That's it. 786 01:32:31,640 -- 01:32:34,359 Good day. 787 01:32:34,520 -- 01:32:39,119 I have a few things to say today. First of all - 788 01:32:39,280 -- 01:32:44,719 - I'd like to award Silver and Gold Horses for our recent engagement. 789 01:32:44,880 -- 01:32:48,479 The first two are Joe and lby. 790 01:32:52,000 -- 01:32:57,959 Joe and lby did something that others might feel differently about. 791 01:32:58,640 -- 01:33:04,759 These guys did it. Five Taliban were firing at the platoon. 792 01:33:04,920 -- 01:33:08,999 Our guys stormed them with a hand grenade and neutralized them. 793 01:33:09,160 -- 01:33:11,999 This takes courage, and I'm proud of you. 794 01:33:12,160 -- 01:33:16,319 I'm awarding you the Gold Horse, and you both deserve it. 795 01:33:16,480 -- 01:33:22,119 We'll see if it leads to more. Damn fine job. 796 01:33:22,640 -- 01:33:25,359 Congratulations. well deserved. 797 01:33:25,520 -- 01:33:28,159 And one for you, Joe. 798 01:33:28,320 -- 01:33:32,359 Congratulations. You deserve it. Give them a hand. 799 01:33:43,920 -- 01:33:47,919 what does it say ...? Smith is a part-time transvestite - 800 01:33:48,080 -- 01:33:50,799 - and a full-time idiot. 801 01:33:50,960 -- 01:33:53,599 Deep thoughts ... 802 01:33:54,600 -- 01:34:00,119 - Not a lot of deep stuff here. - The deepest was painted over. 803 01:34:00,280 -- 01:34:05,399 The guys were a bit pissed about that. Of course there was a lot of shit - 804 01:34:05,560 -- 01:34:09,159 - but there's also stuff which ... 805 01:34:10,840 -- 01:34:14,839 Which was quite cool to read. 806 01:34:15,000 -- 01:34:19,279 And it would be cool to see your own stuff, if you came back. 807 01:34:21,560 -- 01:34:25,839 "In the North I know the fairest land. My people, my home, my native land." 808 01:34:26,000 -- 01:34:30,639 "Denmark." That was quite poetic. 809 01:36:41,040 -- 01:36:46,719 WELCOM E HOM E Thanks for your efforts .. . 810 01:40:58,560 -- 01:41:02,999
