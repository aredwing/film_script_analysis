Lin Li-shui (Missing Person) Shui. Come back soon. I'm waiting for you to sing together. (Yi-chun: Have you got up, lazy boy?) (Just got off work. Goodnight!) Wei. Get up. Get up! Fuck! Why didn't the alarm go off? Grandma. Grandma, why didn't you wake me up? Grandma. Grandma, did you turn my alarm off? No, and I tried to wake you up. It's alright. Come have breakfast! You didn't come home till four in the morning. You slept for only few hours. One needs six to eight hours' sleep. I can't afford that now! You work so hard every day. You're bound to ruin your health! Always come home so late. You hadn't come home when I got up! Hey, sit down and eat properly, okay? What's her name? She's coming for dinner tonight? Yi-chun. Shen Yi-chun. It's better to eat at home. Food in the restaurants isn't clean. Home-made food is clean and safe. Right, listen to me. You keep quiet when she is here. Let me question her tonight. Why don't you get married after four, five years? Why? We're not good enough for her? If you're going to talk nonsense, I won't bring her home. You're always like this when I bring it up. Hey, you! Your lunch box! Lunch. Silly boy. Shu-fang. Ho Wen Shu-fang. Shui. Ho Wen Shu-fang. Hello. Good morning everyone! I'm Yi-chun, the stand-in DJ for today. It's time for Love Moring Roll-call! What exactly is the end of love? Marriage? Some say marriage is the tomb of love. I wonder how you feel about it. Let's take some calls. Oh... Yeah, it's really the tomb. I have to look after not only my kids but parents-in-law. I'm working like a slave. And have to serve my difficult mother-in-law. Hui-chun, have you discussed it with your husband? Yes. Whenever we talk about his mom, he gets angry. His mom is always right. But he has only one mother. What can I do? Okay, thanks for your call. My boyfriend's grandma nags all the time. But actually, I envy you as you've family with you. Not everyone is as lucky as you... (Grandma) Let me play you a nice song first. We'll take more calls after the break. Good morning, everyone! Good morning, sir! Okay, let's shout the slogan. Sincerity is everything! Sincerity is everything! Chu-shan Estate Agency! Chu-shan Estate Agency! Professional! Reliable! Professional! Reliable! Energetic! Yes? There is room for negotiation. (Grandma) Hi, Mr. Ho. Here we are! Mr. and Mrs. Lin. Let's go up. 105 square meters. At the end of the block, it's light. It feels airy with all these windows. If we are done here, let's go back to the office and go over the details. Sure. Please wait for me outside. Let me turn the light off. Yes Grandma? Grandma? (Call Grandma) Let's ask him. Mr. Ho, shall we go? Yes, sorry for keep you waiting. Let's go back to the office. It's 9.45 in the evening. I'm Yi-chun. Thank you for listening to our program. Wish you a very good evening. Goodnight. Yi-chun, I'm sorry. This is my daughter. Bei-bei. Don't run around in the studio, understand? Say hello to Auntie Yi-chun. Auntie Yi-chun Bei-bei, how old are you? I'm three years old. Bei-bei. Three is like this. Don't run around like this. You'll disturb their work. How come you have time to see me tonight? Haven't seen you for ages! Thought you might have eloped with someone! Oh, well. Good to know you're worried. Hey. Grandma has cooked a lot. Let's eat at home, alright? Please... Alright. Does Grandma remember my name or not? Yes, she does. She definitely does! Does she remember yours? Of course she remembers mine! Yeah? Let me take you to a place first. What place? Guess! You're selling it? Miss. Shen. A luxurious four-bedroom family apartment. Brand new steel and concrete structure. Windows on all walls. You've got the most beautiful view of Taipei city! Even playing a song?! My latest service. Viewing the property while dancing! Here is the living room. Oh! I'm going to put an enormous sofa... ...in here. Your music doesn't go well with your dance! Come! Come see this room. This one... It's the master bedroom. It comes with a brand new double bed. Come. Come. Don't jump into someone's bed! - So soft. - What? It'll get dirty. Let's get down. Okay, let's get down. I'm getting down... You're acting so weird today. Wait. You've got any condom with you? We'll get married anyway. If you get pregnant, we'll have a child! Who wants to have a child with you? Or who do you want have children with? Well. Haven't we talked about it so many times? I'll be angry if you do it again. This property... I already paid the deposit. You did? How much did you pay? I mortgaged Grandma's house and paid the deposit. The rest is enough for the first year's payment. - Within a year... - Did you tell Grandma about it? Trust me, the location is good. In two years, the price is bound to soar. I can make at least five million when I sell it. And then we can get married and have children... But it's all in the future... We won't be able buy it when the price soars up. No, it's not the problem. What if Grandma thinks it's my idea? She won't think it's your idea. How do you know? Okay. If you insist on buying, you move in with Grandma. I'll live in my own place. I marry you because I want to live with you. What do you mean me living with Grandma? And you still live in your place? No. Marriage isn't in my plan. How many times have we talked about it? Why don't you want to get married? Why in a hurry? We've been together for five years. Five years! What else do we need? - What is not there? - I've told you that marriage isn't in my plan! I'm exhausted. I haven't slept for twenty-four hours. Do we have to talk about it today? I'm sorry. Grandma, Yi-chun is here! Grandma has cooked a lot of food. Need any help to re-heat it? Yeah, thanks. Grandma? Grandma... You're going out? Shui's come back. I'm going to hers for karaoke. Auntie Shui's back? It's late to meet up! Grandma, I need to talk to you about something. You're still angry at me? The pig trotter was really yummy. I ate it all. Don't stay out too late! Wei. Who are you talking to? Grandma. Grandma? She seems a bit angry at me... Never mind, let's eat on our own. (Ho Wen Shu-fang Day 1) Shui! Come on, everyone! Shui's back! Fuck! Grandma, don't turn my alarm off again, okay?! You're back after seven days! It's truly god's blessing. I told you firecrackers worked! Did you eat anything? - See? - We should have done it earlier! We really should! Good we let off firecrackers. Safety is everything. You made us so worried. Uncle Kun. Did you see my grandma? No. Ah, she... Now she... - Did anyone call her family? - Yeah. - Go tell them. - Auntie Shui. Tell them she's back. It's good you're safe. We were so worried. Did you see my grandma? I'm sorry... I'm sorry. What are you sorry for? It's not my fault. What happened? Don't be fooled by her! Shui, what are you sorry for? I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. A parcel for Ho Chih-wei. Everyone is having so much fun! Everyone, look over here. Lin Li-shui, look! You can't call people's full names in the mountains! And don't pat people on their shoulders. Why not? If you call someone's full name, and he turns around, he'll be caught to replace someone else in the woods. Really? Hey, do you smell something weird? - Do you? - I caught the smell just now. It smells like a dead rat. No, it's not the smell of a dead rat. Well, I think the toilet is blocked. Really? How come I can't smell it? How can you not smell it? It's really bad! Didn't you take the garbage out? It smells rotten. It's so dirty! Uncle Kun. Is this Auntie Shui's camera? Yes, it's Shui's camera. How did you get it? Do you know where Auntie Shui's house is? Here is her house. Why is the door left open? They were here when I came this morning. How could this happen? Let me find the light switches. What are you doing? Nothing. Come help me! I haven't turned the power on yet. Are you all right? (Grandma, whenever you come back.) (Please wake me up, okay?) (Love, Wai) It's captured on the morning your grandma went missing. Here, look! See? Your grandma was going out. Grandma doesn't walk like that. We didn't came home till the evening. It means grandma wasn't there. Wait, wind back a bit. Okay. Here, wind back a bit. Okay. Here. Look at this... Now I'd like to ask you to do me a favor. Grandma Ho has gone missing since she left home on 16th April. Her family are really worried about her. Please call us if you see someone who fits the description. She's 75-year-old... That kind of ghosts live in the mountains. His grandma didn't go to the mountains recently. How could she be caught? The trees in the mountains have been chopped down. The spectres now have no place to live. So they come down here to catch people. Wei, don't worry. Old people often wander off and get lost. Don't worry. She'll be back. Come on, let's let off the firecrackers. Come on. Stand aside. Let's let off firecrackers. Wei. Get up. Wei. Wei. Get up! Slowly. Eat more! Wow, it's so yummy! Really yummy? Careful, don't get your clothes dirty. Or you won't look good on the ceremony. Come, have another egg. Grandma, you're a super cook! Really? Okay. Here. Wei. When you grow up, promise you'll often eat with Grandma. Okay? Don't be like your father. Come, eat up! Okay? Okay! I'll eat with you every day! Okay, good boy. I'll write it down. Remember it. Okay. I'll remember it. What are you doing? Ho Chih-wei. Ho Chih-wei. (Ho Chih-wei promises to eat with his grandma every day) Ho Chih-wei. You got up? I did try to wake you. What happened to you? What's up? Say something. What's up? I'm just... ...haven't hug you for a long time. Okay. Okay, grandma lets you hug. Don't cry, good boy. Bring your... What's her name? Shen Yi-chun. Oh, okay. Shen Yi-chun. Shen Yi-chun. Bring her home for dinner. Okay? Okay? We'll have dinner together like family. Okay. Hello everyone, welcome back. We're going to take the last call. It's from Shu-hui in Kaohsiung. Hello Shu-hui. He doesn't love me anymore. He doesn't love me anymore. Shu-hui, who doesn't love you anymore? He doesn't love me anymore. He doesn't love me anymore. Shu-hui, you may need to speak up a little. Or neither I nor other listeners can hear you. He doesn't love me anymore. He doesn't love me anymore. He doesn't love me anymore. He doesn't love me anymore. Okay, Shu-hui. No matter who he is, we women have to be strong and independent. And I... Hello? Hello? Well. We may have problems with the line. But it's okay. At the end of the show, I'd like to say to all women. No matter he loves you or not, you have to learn to love yourself. Be brave when a relationship comes to an end. The next show is Ten p.m. Roll-call. Now let's hear a cheerful song. See you next time. Bye-Bye Why do you suddenly show up? - Are you all right? - Grandma invites you to dinner at home tonight. Grandma's back? Let's have dinner at home tonight. You're sweating. What happened? Are you feeling sick? Come home for dinner with me. Okay. Let's go see a doctor before going home. Come on. You look horrible. Sit here. Here. Wait for me. I'd like to see a doctor. - First visit? - Yes. Your health insurance card, please. Here, fill in the form. Ho Chih-wei, what are you doing? Don't you think babies are so cute? Hurry up, come see a doctor! Why don't you want to marry me? Quiet. You're disturbing the babies. Why don't you want to marry me? Do we have to talk about it now? Why don't you want to have a baby? Can you afford it? What on earth are you talking about? Come, let's go see a doctor. I want to go home and eat with Grandma. Ho Chih-wei! Grandma, I brought Yi-chun back for dinner. Pork rib stew. Braised rump pork. Uncle Kun! Come on, quick! - What happened? - Wei... What happened? Wei... Wei is... What happened? Wei...He was here just now! (Ho Chih-wei Day 1) Gods in Heaven. Gods in the Netherworld. Please perform a miracle for us! Yi-chun, we had better burn that too. Come... Yi-chun, here is the last trick. It's the most important one... Repeat after me. Louder! Muster your strength. Dear mountain gods, we're asking you for help. Please protect us. Go back to hell, you ghosts! You motherfucker! Back to the mountains! Don't make trouble here! Well, say... Back to the mountains! Don't make trouble here! That's enough for you. Come on, louder! You motherfucker! Go back! Louder! Fuck! Go away! I'm not scared of you! Fuck! I'd like you to help me with one thing. Mr. Ho Chih-wei left home around midnight on 20th April and has gone missing since then. His family are really worried about him. - Wish you - Hello ma'am. - Can help me - Are you looking for a new home? I can help you with any property you need. Ho is about 26-year-old. 178cm in height. Male with short hair. He was wearing a pale blue shirt And black pants. If you see him, please call the local police station. Or call the radio station so we can relay the info to his family. So his family could find him soon. Now it's you. Here! Here! The police saw her. She had nothing with her. The police found her walking on the motorway. So many people... So many threes... Grandma is fine. Just a bit dehydrated. So scary... Her mental status is very unstable. There's someone... So many threes... Mrs. Ho, Yi-chun has come to see you. Mrs. Ho. .. I called Wei's name... I called Wei's name... - Grandma, relax. - I called Wei's name... Take a deep breath. I called Wei's name! - Calm down. - I called Wei's name! Take a deep breath. Grandma. Grandma, relax. - I called Wei's name... - Take a deep breath. I called Wei's name! Why vomiting like that? I bet she was taken to the mountains by the ghost. That day... You thought it was Wei. But it was the spectre. It was in Shui's house. And now it's gone to Mrs. Ho's place. Come over! ("Mosien") (Walk up to the mountains) (It's where spectres often show up.) (We two were turning that way.) (But we saw his brother keep walking ahead.) (Rumor has it that) ("mosiens" make people lose their minds...) (Call your full name.) I told my friend we should wake him up. But we couldn't... (Woman in her eighties missing for two days.) (We couldn't find the way back.) (We let off firecrackers and walked back.) (When in the supernatural world,) (if you let off firecrackers) (or use explosive,) (you can break the spell and return.) It'll destroy the supernatural power. Yes, it'll be destroyed. (To the mountains) (and someone talked to her.) (Now they say that) (the little girl in red) (wants to take her to the mountains.) (But she's malicious.) There seem to be a lot of spectres. If it was only one or two, it was fine. All the stories sound similar. Lin Huo-kun. Lin Huo-kun... Miss Shen, the thing is... I'd like to tell you what happened the other day. We thought Mrs. Ho might have food poisoning. So we ran a test on her vomit. And we found this. Please have a look. It's a moth chrysalis. And it's still alive. My colleague at the Toxicology says it's "death's-head hawk-moth". A very rare species of insect. We have no idea why it ended up in her stomach. This is what I need to tell you. (Death's-head hawk-moth) Grandma, you take a good rest. I'm off to work. I'll come back after work. When Wei comes back, tell him I'll leave this house to him. We were quite well off. But we lost our fortune. So Wei works very hard to make money. Ask him not to work so hard and spend more time with you. Can you get the box for me? It's over there. Grandma. She came to me again last night. Who? She says she can take me to see Wei. She needs a pair of shoes. I should be the one taken away, not you guys. It should be me. What are you talking about? Grandma, please don't think too much. Wei must love you so much. So he didn't call your name. Uncle Kun. Could you please keep an eye on Grandma? Please...Im running late for work. Please make sure she doesn't wander off. Thank you! Thanks! Just before we end the program, I wonder if you can do me a favor. I saw a species of moth on the Internet. It's called "death's-head hawk-moth". Very little about it can be found online. So if anyone knows about their habitat, where you can see them, or if you have any relevant information, you're welcome to call me at the radio station. Thank you for listening to our program tonight. See you next time. Goodnight. Bei-bei, it's closed! Yi-chun, we're off! Bye bye, auntie. Hello. (Wanlongkeng, Shenkengao) Hello. Sir, can you say it again, please? She says she's going to the mountains to find her. Find whom? Her... She says she's going to the mountain to find her. Did she say which mountain she's going? Wanlongkeng! Excuse me. Are you her family? Yes, I'm her family. You know in which county it is? Shenkengao or something sounds like that... Could you check it for me? Yes, let me check it. Wait a minute. Everyone's gone to Wanlongkeng. Everyone! Everyone's gone to find her. (Chun, I'll definitely marry you in five years.) You sure he's your boyfriend? Please sign these papers to confirm you join the mission voluntarily and understand all the risks involved. Our mission is to find your boyfriend and his grandma. If you get lost in the mountains, here's a whistle. Blow the whistle at once and hang the red strips on the trees. Then we'll find you. Here. Take a few emergency flares with you. Apart from lighting, it'll scare the beasts off. Can you keep UP? Yeah... Grandma? Grandma! Grandma! Captain! Grandma is over there. Grandma is over there! - Grandma! - Med, over here! - Grandma! - Yeah. The paramedics are here. Grandma. Miss. Excuse me, miss. - Excuse me. - Sorry. Grandma. You go back! - You go back or she'll catch you. - Grandma, what did you say? Excuse me, we need to take her back first. You go back! We need to go. Grandma, what did you say? You go back or she'll catch you. Go back! Go back! Go back! Roger that. Miss Shen. Do you recognise the shoes? They're my boyfriend's old shoes. You still want to come with us? Miss Shen. Have it. Thanks. First time to spend a night in the mountains? Yes. Don't be scared. They're scared of us too. If we respect each other and coexist in harmony, they won't do you any harm. A lot of people went missing in the mountains? Legend has it that every tree has a soul. If you cut down a tree for no good reason, the mountain will capture a person and plant the person's soul in the mountains. Plant? How? I don't really know. Because. I've never been planted. Well, if Bin gets planted one day, you'll be the first to know! By the way, how did you know your boyfriend came to this mountain? A retired mountain guide told me. His name is Wang Tien-tze. Told you? HOW? You know Mr. Wang? Sure. He's our patron saint. He built all the paths you see around here. He phoned me in my office and told me about Wanlongkeng. You must be joking, right? No'? But... He died a long time ago. My grandpa told me he was a mountain guide during the Japanese occupation. Captain. The road splits. It's splits into three directions. We're breaking into three small groups. Erge, take the two seniors and go down Gu Line. Li, you and Yi-lin cut through the hill. The rest follow me on Ling Line. Miss Shen, you come with me. Report to me on radio every hour. Any questions? No! Okay, let's go. Are you okay? Yes, I'm okay. Hey, I'm here! Hey, I'm here! Hey! Chih-Wei! Yi-chun. Shen Yi-chun. Shen Yi-chun. Shen Yi-chun. Mommy. Mommy. Mommy. Mommy. He doesn't love me anymore... Mommy. He doesn't love me anymore... He doesn't love me anymore... He doesn't love me anymore... He doesn't love me anymore... Mommy. Mommy. Mommy. Mommy. Mommy. Mommy, why didn't you want me? Mommy, why did you get rid of me? Mommy. Mommy, why didn't you want me? I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. You're up? Come have breakfast. What happened to you? I had a nightmare. I couldn't find you. Don't be scared. I'm here. You've found me. Eat something. Let me get you a glass of milk. Where's Grandma? She's in the nursing home. Nursing home? Why? She's been there for two years. We agreed to it. You didn't want to live with her, did you? Are you really okay? You're asking weird questions! You don't want to eat? Come, let me feed you. I'm not hungry. Okay, you can eat later. What's wrong? You're acting so weird today. Take me to see Grandma. Finish your breakfast first. Then I'll take you there, okay? Let's go. Where are you going? I'll take you there later. Chih-Wei! Chih-Wei! Ho Chih-wei! Ho Chih-wei! Come on, Ho Chih-wei! Ho Chih-wei, wake up! Come! No... Hurry UP! One must stay. Yi-chun, you go! I'll stay. Yi-chun. Leave, now! Let's go together. Bei-bei, how old are you? I'm three years old. Mommy, why did you get rid of me? I'm sorry. Why don't you want to get married? I've told you marriage isn't in my plan. (Chun, I'll definitely marry you in five years.) Give me my Ho Chih-wei back! Chih-Wei! Hello everyone. It's 3.20 in the afternoon. I'm Yi-chun and I've been very happy these days. I wonder if you've thought about what you want most in your life? Is it a successful career? Or simple happiness in life? Or you just want to sit down for dinner with your beloved family? I think, in fact, in everyone's heart grows a forest. Don't let our stubbornness damage it. Remember to leave some time for yourselves. From time to time, we should air our secrets in the sun. Next let's hear a beautiful song. See you next time!
