One, you done all your time so far with kids, instead of real cons. So you think you tougher than you actually are. Two, the guards of the Y.O.S. still think they can put Humpty back together again. Which makes you soft. It means you used to getting away with shit. Here, you throw an elbow at another inmate, we got a problem. You understand that? Aw, man. This is gonna be fun. Hell of a way to make a first impression on your committee, yo. Pick a fight before you even step off the bus. Burns. Let's go. Shoulder against the wall. Fuck! What, are you nervous? These kids have been going to school together forever. What if they don't like me? I know better than you, boy. They know nothing about you. You're gonna be great. There's Larr. We're here to discuss the enrolment of James Burns into the freshman class of Roosevelt High School, per the request of his mother, Tracy Burns. Miss Burns, let me be frank with you. We have some concerns. Okay. We're listening. We've read your son's record, and we're not convinced that our school is the right place for a student with his particular history. There are other institutions that might be more... Wait. Beneficial. Are you saying you're-you're not gonna take him? Obviously we're... This is a public school. Is this... Experiences of abuse that your son endured, but the fact is that James has a record of unstable, even violent behaviour. He could be a danger to the other children. Mm-hmm. You spent 20 minutes with this file, suddenly you're an expert on my son? You're the James expert. Excuse me. Feel free at any time to step in and do your job. At 14, James already has convictions for robbery, vandalism, and assault. He's been institutionalized three times in eight years, once for threatening your boyfriend with a knife. Jesus, he was ten years old. The fact is... All the required equivalency tests. Yes, he has. He wants to enrol here, and his counsellor has declared him fit to do so. And he will. And we'll be back. Come on, let's go. It's only music So what's wrong with music? And there's hate It's only music Hold on. Deception, injected Yeah? Shape things to come A below birth and break it down from birth Cursed, sinnin' and killin' 275 million Imperfections connected with the greatest invention The intentions of flesh Yes? You know... I've heard bullshit like that woman said my whole life. This is a setback, that's all. No one said it was gonna be easy. Whatever. You've been doing real good these past three months, but you gotta be patient. You gotta... you gotta stay home, you gotta stay outta trouble, you gotta let the lawyer do his job. Yeah. No one's gonna drive you to school today if you miss the bus. Holly, did you finish the milk? No. Fuck it. Can't you get what you give? Gimmie-gimmie what you got Hey, what's up? Um, hi. Hi. How are you? I'm good, how are you. Yo, dude, your toilet's flooded. Go, go, go, go. Run, hurry! What the hell? Goddamn kid, I'll teach you lesson. Come on. Come on, come on! What are you doing? That was crazy! I'm Crystal. I'm James. You wanna get high? I just bought these high tops this year. 150 fuckin' dollars. You know what the problem is? They're made by some kids in China. Probably doesn't even know what a pair of sneakers looks like. What are you talking about? Yo, I gotta get out of here. Why? If I'm not home by eight, a box pops up my PO's computer and I'm fucked. Oh shit. What did you do? I brought home a gun. My mom found it in my sock drawer and freaked, so I got 15 months in juvie. Wait, are you serious? Your mom called the cops. Yeah. Your mom. Yeah. Damn. I gotta go. Oh, no, don't be like that. Come on. Come on, I'm just playing with you. I'm sure Mommy loves you very much. Shit. The kids looks about... Nine? Probably doesn't have a care in the world. I'm 14. And fuck you. I got cares. So that thing only works at night? I guess so. So what are you doing tomorrow? Okay. Try it now. Ha-ha. What's up? New fish. I give him two weeks. Mm-mm, bullshit. Three days commissary says Jongo's gonna turn him out quicker'n nothin'. Oh, shit look at what we got here. What's up, fresh meat? She looks like a little puta to me. I don't want trouble. S'all right, Opie. You'll be safe with us. We got your back. Leave it alone, JB. Guillermo already got beef with you over that beat down you gave his boy at intake. Yo, Guillermo, why you such a bitch? Holy shit, it's fuckin' Dennis the Menace. You got something to say, white boy? Huh? Wanna make this about us, or what? Nah. I'm just wondering why a bigger mano like you only has the heart to fuck with the punks. Fuck you. You disrespectful little bitch. You just bought that one. Everybody get the fuck down! Fuck you! Get down. Get up, Burns. You been here, what? Three weeks? And how many fights is that, convict? 'Cause honestly I've lost count. You know, at first I thought, I dunno, maybe you're trying to prove yourself. Show the natives they shouldn't mess with you and your baby face. But now I think, maybe you're just a guy that likes fighting. Just trying to protect... And who the fuck are you? Chris Cesario. I'm new. No shit! You think this asshole is protecting you? You think he's your friend? Are you this fish's friend, inmate? No. Are you trying to protect him from getting his shit reamed by this wetback or anybody else in my yard? No. Why don't you tell him, inmate? I don't give a fuck about you. You must not care about the ratification committee. You couldn't possibly. 'Cause you like it here. I like it here. The difference is, I like it here because this is my yard. You like it here 'cause it's an opportunity for you to suck dick! Once a loser... always a loser. Thought you said your mom wasn't home. Okay, then, why are you afraid? Look, Mary, I thought you were cool. Okay! Nice place, Mary. Oh. Mary. You were very cute. What happened? Just like a... oh! Was this what you were talkin' about?

It's cold out. Hey, James. You know what? Any time he wants... your PO can come to this house and search through your shit. You think he won't haul your ass right back into lockup? So tell me, what is this? Did you have people over? Were you drinking alcohol in my house? What about school? You know the judge is about to hear your appeal. And we are so close. So close to what? I've been stuck at home for two months. And they're still fighting to keep me out. They don't want me. Do you know how hard I'm working for you? You know what? Fuck school!

If you're so smart, where's Dad? Huh? Okay, that's real mature and, you know, I'd love to sit around and whine all day, but I'm actually trying to live up to my God damn responsibilities, so go ahead... fuck up your life! See if I care. So... Shower time. Time to wash those asses. Get a move on. Move, move. James. James, look out! Move out. Chris! They've been at it before, maybe five minutes. The water in the showers is gonna be turned off. We're just giving them a bit before we go in and let them wear each other out. Go! Go, go, go, get in there. Medical! I need medical! Need medical in shower six! Stat! A medic! Who brought in the shank? The kid in critical condition with two stab wounds... he stole a car. First offence. Zero record of violence. His mother comes to visit him every week, together with his girlfriend. I'm not a snitch. So what? Think your pals aren't gonna talk? You don't think that bean eater is gonna say the shank was yours? I looked up your arrest report. You got away that night. Clean. You wouldn't even be in here if your girlfriend hadn't sold you out. Jesus Christ. Her statement was 12 pages long. Fuck you! Nobody's following this bullshit code of honour but you. Inside. Put your hands through. I either comin' like Noah 'Chu lookin' for, yo? I need to talk to Roc. What'chu got, man? Well? I need to make some money. Yo D, who the fuck is this? I'm a friend of Crystal's? He wasn't talking to you, man. Crystal? Get down here. Now! Bitch talks too much. You call something for this kid? I only met him once. Not exactly a ringing endorsement, is it? I got a general rule that everybody on my crew's old enough to have hair on their dicks. Yo, I'm not leaving. Oh, man. Excuse me? Look, I get it. You take some weak-ass kid under your wing, and you look weak too. But I'm not asking for a favour. I got brains. Plus I can hustle. And I don't scare easy. Woof woof woof. You okay running errands? Cleaning the bathroom, shit like that? Yeah. Good. 'Cause we do this, you'll be my bitch. Take it or leave it, non-negotiable. I take it. My bitch! Hello? Hey. It's me. James, what the fuck? The police are here every day looking for you. They pulled Holly out of class. I'm not coming home. We can still find a way to fix this. I love you, but there's nothing else you can do for me. I know you think I don't understand, but whatever it is, you've decided you have to do right now Just tell me where you are and I'll come get you, boy. Tell Holly to keep her head up. Hey... What was that? Don't worry about it. Yo, this is bullshit, I can help, man. You don't know shit about packing no ammo. We'll be done with these faggots in ten minutes. Your job is to be waiting right here with the key in the ignition. Okay. Pop willie pop Guess what? Aw, freestyle Bottom of the gun and is so dramatic Like the oceans crashing and the former waves Imma pour, it's gonna rain And when I pop my style You get transformed from the name to a civilized man With a mic in the hand selling with gat You wanna strap somethin' else follow me rap Listen Yo, running back doors Running back doors Hold it! You're not so tough now, are you? Huh, tough guy? Huh? You really thought you was gonna come in here and take our shit? Ow! Oh, shit. Ah! What the shit? Manny, grab the shit! Shut the fuck up. Holy shit! You, look at me. Lights out, motherfucker. Things just got real for you, kid. Let's go. Go! Bet you'd like to stick your dick in that, huh? I'd love to. I bet that kid doesn't even know what a pussy looks like. I do. It looks like Manny. Ha-ha. Oh. Thank you. Oh. Look. The world's a jungle. Right? It's ugly. That's just how it is. Guys like me and you survive, 'cause we're the fuckin' lions. That's half Manny's take from tonight. You earned it. But don't take it unless you want what comes with it. Well, I want it. No. I'm not sure you do. I want the fuckin' money, Roc. Okay then. Yes. Yo, shut up a minute! To Jamesy Boy. Kid can kick up some fuckin' dust. I gotta take a piss. Yeah, you go do that. Yo, Mercedes! I wanna introduce you to my new boy. Sudden yeah But you don't know I gotta have to try again The argument And just like that It's gone You crazy kid You let it show You're perfect how you got it And so forget it And just like that It's gone It's gone So I heard you had a really good day today. Roc's not so easily impressed. I guess he recognizes talent. That was on the phone with my mom today. I told her I'm not coming home. A sudden hit And you don't know You don't have to do it again And just like that, it's gone You wanna dance? Yeah. I do. You know what the worst thing was about living with my mom? It was the constant reminder we weren't gonna make it. Seeing her putting more and more hours to pay fewer and fewer bills. Busting her ass trying to work a system that had let her down from day one. Now my kid sister's in trouble at school. The teachers all decide she's a bad kid. She gets labelled and she's fucked. Because that's how the world works for people like us. If we let it, you know? What? You can sleep here if you want to. Hold. Open 42. Watch out! Hey, old timer. You got anything to read? Come on, I've been in the hole for three weeks. I'm going batshit. I don't wanna be friends, guppy. I've been down more than three years, I ain't no fish. JB... Guillermo runnin' his mouth, man. Punk ass said you snuck him in the shower. Wants to put a knife in your back. So what? So we should handle that. Why does nobody test that guy? 'Cause that guy made it known he didn't wanna be tested. Motherfucker's got status in the yard. Killed five people inside and saying he's done two more since. Hold! Planning a vacation? Don't talk to me. Why I'm right? 'Cause poetic seizures keep me thinking in Morse code, so I write all the Tory hallucinations in sign language, so you can see how it sounds when I write, all right? I write keys and escape plans but chain gangs, street gangs turn into literary genius, am I right? I rewrite, everybody start, everyone have to write... Yard's over! Yo. What's in Rio de "Janeerio"? Shut up. Hit. Hit. Somethin' better. Somethin' better? It's pronounced "Janeiro". You've been? Only in my mind. I got this kid hurt. There was a fight in the showers and he got stabbed. So? So, I'm gonna do something about it. Oh, starting a yard war is a good way to make sure you don't go back to the real world. Maybe that's what you're scared of. I'm not scared. Oh, you think you different than these other assholes? News for you, kid. You're not. Go! Oh, shit! Hey. Um, can I get two grape cigarillos and a pack of racks, please? Do you have ID? Oh... I think I forgot it at home. Come on, we're friends aren't we? Just take it. What? I don't want any trouble. I've seen you around. I know you deal drugs. I'm not robbing you. I'm paying, see? I'm James. Hey. Come here. Let's go somewhere and fuck. Uh-huh It's a fly little low so I thought you got that outfit last week week When you were shoppin' Call it heavy Fly while you catch up on the latest Hey yo, slow down. Yo! Are you deaf? Hey, yo, slow down. What, here? Yo, pull the fuck over! Pull over! What the hell is wrong with you? You know with the shit we got in the trunk? If a cop pulled us over we would get ten years. Roc sends you on a couple errand boy jobs and suddenly you're fucking invincible? No. Then what? What? I've invincible all along. Ugh! Plus, with the amount of paper I've been puttin' in Roc's pocket, he's gonna start taking me more seriously. I ain't nobody's bitch, Crystal. Grimey, fuck this. Jamesy Boy here, talkin' me into bringing him back to their own crib, to plan their next move. But once, now look, once he's inside... Wha'd you do, man? I robbed them. Oh, shit. Naw, right? Swear to God, no jokes little brother, picks up one of their own pieces, right? A'ight. Mm-hmm, yeah. Stands one guy, against four. Eenie, meenie, miney, motherfuckin' Moe. Shit. Tells him he's collecting a "disloyalty tax". Disloyalty tax. Hold up. What the fuck happened after that? They shit their pants, is what happened! They paid him! They pissed all over their rug. And I end up making money on what's supposed to be a strike against me. Right? But that shit ain't even the point. Naw. The point is, Jamesy Boy's got loyalty. It was good. I want to talk to you about some ideas I got. Maybe a couple deals I think I could line up on my own. All right. Drink one of these. Put some fuckin' bass in your voice. Not now. Right? You keep putting in that work on the smaller jobs, we'll see. All good? Cool. All right. By the way, congratulations on Crystal. Thank God for the sluts, right? Hon, look what I found. What is this, like a diary or some shit? You writing down your feelings? What are you doing? Can you imagine if Roc or Drew found this? Give it back! Oh my God. I said give it back to me! Oh! Calm down. Hey. I just didn't know my big tough gangster had a soft and chewy centre. What? Hey! Hey. Come here. I'm sorry, okay? I promise we'll never talk about your diary again. All right? How was your drive? Long. There was construction, the weather's shit, of course. How's Holly? Better. She says hi. She looks like she might actually... make good. I guess I probably helped with that. "Now you best behave yourself or you'll end up You haven't ended up like anything yet. God, I hate... I hate this place. I could've been here too. No, you wouldn't have. Thanks. What do you want for Christmas? What? Your hearing's in five weeks, it's your first Christmas in four years, you can bet there's gonna be something under the tree. When was the last time you got a tree? I'm getting you a kickass present, so unless you want socks, you better say something. Just a hearing, Mom. We've both got dealt shitty hands, boy, but things are gonna get better? Yeah. Yo. Well? Is it honest? Yeah. Why the hell do you care what I think? You really kill five people? There's a giant bay... and in the middle there's a rock... and way up high on the mountain... there's a 100-foot tall statue of Jesus Christ... with his arms spread out. They speak Spanish there, right? Naw. No, Portuguese. It's the only country in South America where they don't speak Spanish. And they eat those, um... those little bananas, right? Plantains. Hmm. Now you keep writing. It don't matter about what, it don't even matter if it's good or not. You do everything you can to just block this shit out. Just block it out. Prisons are packed with crowded spaces. Lifers and guards, with hollow faces. Amongst the sea... But amongst the sea of tribulation... Well, I'm waiting on a day when the people walk free To see and the penitentiary is on fire There's only to be your mother Or your brother or the one to come before you for I'm waiting on a time when the people walk free to see And the penitentiary in our mind There's no need to bleed for your father Or your son all the the one that you recall When the penitentiary is on fire When the penitentiary is on fire I'm waiting on a day when the people come free Cesario, get up man. You gotta show them you're strong, get the fuck up, man. All right. What's up with you? What's up, ha. Read that. I had a girl on the outside too. I was crazy for her. But after I went down, she stopped talking. It's tough. But it's not the end of the world. I guess so, ha. Stephanie was like the whole reason I kept going. Two fucking years. So, you know, um, when I was in the med ward, there were these visitors that would come in and read to us. One of them told me something. That we have the right to file a formal complaint and bypass the COs, and go straight to the administration. You can't do that. If there's an investigation, maybe they'll... maybe they'll transfer me out of here. Where do you think you are? Administration would never side with an inmate against the system. Everybody looks out for their own. All right. You're close. Just keep your head down. All right, once you're out of here, you'll get a new girlfriend with bigger tits. Yeah? You promise? Did your old girlfriend have big tits? Um, I... no. I promise. What are you doin' here? Thought Roc was sending Drew? He couldn't come. It's just me. Who the fuck are you? We're here to collect for Roc. The fuck you are. I deals with Roc. Not his little schoolboy bitches. Come on, man. You know we work for Roc, it doesn't have to be that way. Actually, let's do it exactly this way. You wanna test us? Fine. Pick it up. Pick it up! Okay, you pick it up. James, let's just... Pick it up! Now where's the money? What do you see here, man? Is this a fucking game of cops and robbers? I don't have any. Bullshit. Bullshit! What's in the safe? Shut up! Stop screaming! What are you doing? Yo! What are you doing? Bro, somebody's gonna see you. What the fuck! You're insane! Holy shit! What? Look at this! How much you think this shit's worth? You're an idiot. What was I supposed to do? Turn around and leave the room with my tail between my fucking legs? With a gun on you? Yeah. That's exactly what you're supposed to do. You wanna live to be like Roc? Then you gotta be smart. Stop doing 90 with a trunk full of drugs. I'd rather die young than just coast through life without ever stepping up. Being a man is about taking initiative. A man? You're not a man. You're just a little boy with a death wish. Fuck you! Grow up! What about Roc? Is he a man? Is that why you fucked him? James. Stop. What about those guys in the club? Are they men too? I said stop. You're just a piece of ass to them. That's all you'll ever be. Don't you fucking walk away from me! Unlock the fridge! Unlock the fucking fridge! Hello? Shit. I'm sorry. You have ID? Um... It's my dad's store. We live next door. I help out when I'm not in school. I dunno if you know this, but there's some lunatics running around this hood. Especially at this time of night. He's drunk. So it's either do it myself or we lose the business for the night. Fair enough. Anyway, I can handle myself. What happened to your hand? You scared of me? I don't know. Maybe. You want a cigarette? Maybe. Thanks. And what are you doing? Magic trick. Yeah? Yeah. 'Kay... You see? Full pack. Mm-hmm. But wait. Little shake. And... they're gone. But wait... They're back. No way! Way. Oh! I applaud you. Who was that girl you were with last week? Oh... that is, um, Crystal. She's all right. What the fuck did you do? Roc. Calm down, bro. This guy was trying to screw you over. I was just showing a little initiative. A little initiative? Yeah. I'm doing this shit for you, man. Oh. Thank God. 'Cause, see, that's not what I thought. I thought you got your pride wounded. And that you stupidly, without thinking about it, burned one of my contacts. My business partners. Just to make yourself feel better. That's not how it is... Shut the fuck up! It's not how it... Shut up! That's not all! I also thought you stole a huge fucking bag of guns and brought it back to my house! I oughta fill you with fucking lead. James... Then, James, I thought no. No. Jamesy Boy wouldn't do that. Jamesy Boy's smart. Jamesy Boy would know that guns are a shit business. 'Cause if we sell them on the street... any punk bitch who gets busted with one just to get a couple years knocked off their time! Fuckin' James. That is my money in that bag. You and D are gonna figure out a way to fix this. You feel me? Yeah. Hmm? Yeah. Come in. Sorry to bother you, sir. This is with the medical kites. Put him in room four. Sir. Must be important... if you wanna talk to me. Take Cesario off the yard until his hearing. Put him in PC. He's too weak. You don't get into a fight for a week, I'm supposed to think you grew a heart. Somebody's gonna hurt him? Great. Gimme a name. This is an inmate who was involved in a near fatal knife fight in my shower room. That's bullshit... No, but I don't know that because, see, you didn't make a statement at the time, did you? So you're gonna let the kid die to teach me a fucking lesson? Hey, watch your tone, convict. Remember who you're talking to. There are 30,000 people incarcerated in this state right at this very minute, you know how many work here? 3,000. Total. My COs come to work ten hours a day completely surrounded by assholes like you who spend 24 trying out how to murder him. Big badge of honour to take down a corrections officer, ain't that right? No, for Chris... If I can't afford to make the distinction... you think I'm an asshole because it's fun? I do it... because that's how my guys survive. I'm taking a real risk sitting down with you right now. I'm asking you. Person to person. There's nothing I can do. Hey, yo, white boy... Heard you been talking to Falton. You mention me, or any one of my soldagos... I'll make sure you get your throat cut. Hey, controllate. It ain't my fault your little bitch ass boyfriend keeps on falling down stairs. You're gonna fuck up his release, you know that? Do something. You ain't got no heart. Do something, white boy. Come on. Hit me. I wanna see them revoke your ass. Right here. Free shot, white boy. Take your shot, right here. Yo, wreck that motherfucker, JB. Do something! Excuse me. Can I help you? Uh, yeah. Is Sarah around? Do you know what damn time it is? Dad, it's okay. I used to take walks like this with my mom. Yeah? Before she got sick. The spine, yeah. She got better. But she hasn't been the same since. I think for a while there she thought she was gonna die and she was disappointed that the world didn't stop. My dad still had the store, I still went to school. I made her angry. Man, you don't hold back, do you. I can stop if you want. No, I didn't mean it like that. I've been institutionalized since I was six. What did you do when you were six? I was an angry kid. I used to get into fights, break things, shit like that. My whole life I've never been to a regular school. And as far as I can remember, every room I walked into... they already knew I was a lost cause. All I want... is a normal life. What if a man came from the future and said you'd have a happy life? What if he showed you your future wife and your children and you're all totally happy? Would you be scared? I don't know. Not that it matters. I'm not the kind of girl that rises above all this. I'm not so pretty and I don't do that well in school. Nobody's coming from the future to tell us anything. Maybe that's true. But... you are pretty. I been down I been down A different road I been out I have been out of control But when you touch me like yeah, yeah I get my senses back Yeah So now feelin' all right 'Cause nothing feels like When you're holding on Say I feel all right 'Cause nothing feels like When you're holding I'm sorry. When you're holding I'm feeling all right 'Cause nothing feels like When you're holding on When you're holding on I wanna treat you Like you wanna be treated Any news? Oh yeah. Cesario got revocated. Six years. Heh... What's the matter, Burns? You look sad. Who is that? Hey! That's James. My friends, Robyn. Hey, what's up? You got to school here? Uh, James goes to Roosevelt. Wanna play some ball? We need another person. Sure. All right. James is on my team. Cool. Ball, ball, ball! Woo-hoo-hoo-hoo! Woo! Get your man! Ah! James! Woo! Did you see that? I didn't know you could play ball. Yeah. One of many skills I learned courtesy of the state. Yo, James. Hurry up man. Yo! Ew, you're all sweating. 'Kay, I'm gonna go play. All right. What are you always writing about? Nothing. I'm gonna take you away from this shithole neighbourhood. That sounds nice. Things are gonna be different. We're gonna be different. Good. Look who decided to visit. You know, it's like you're never here anymore. I'm leaving. The fuck you are. This isn't a good place, Crystal. It's a dead end. You should get out too. With who? With you? Do you love me? No. You don't. You'd rather fuck that ugly bitch from the store, right? Don't talk about her like that. Where you been that past two weeks? Huh? You been sleeping at her house? You're stupid. You pathetic little boy. And you're never gonna find another woman like me. You wanna what me and Roc did last night? Yo! Where you going? I got the call this morning. Chuck found the body. The deal's tonight. What happened to loyalty, James? What happened to riding 'till the wheels fall off? Yo. I'm the guy who took you in off the street and gave you your shot. I don't owe you anything, Roc. Okay. Let me paint you a picture, Jamesy Boy. One year from now, and we kicking it at the club, doing better than ever, wearing rollies. Reminiscing.

What did you do? Pack up some things. We'll go somewhere far away where nobody knows us. What are you talking about? There's my family, the store. I can't just leave. But it's what we promised. No, it's not. Are the police looking for you? You're asking me to throw my whole life away, James. I won't do that. You're the only thing... I have left. I'm sorry. I been ridin' To my favourite timin' It's too bad your timin' It just never came Well, I don't know how else to say In a different way But why don't you Just Fade away 'Cause there's a battle goin' on Down South of Babylon So why don't you just fade away Lieutenant Falton, thank you for your patience. Of course, ma'am. James Burns, 18 years old, originally arrested four years ago for selling of firearms, drug possession and illegal possession of a firearm. Do you know the inmate we're talking about? Yes. How long has he been housed with you? Four months. And you oversee the level five portion of the jail where Mr. Burns was assigned because of his history of institutional violence, correct? Yes, ma'am, I do. Three months ago, the prisoner was involved in an altercation in the shower room where another inmate was stabbed with a homemade weapon. Well, well, well, there was some other... Yes, I know, please. Yes. And the prisoner who was injured had no record of violence up until that point? That is correct. Two weeks ago, Mr. Burns was involved in an additional altercation during roll call, in which he severely injured another inmate, beating him with his fists, and in the course of that altercation, he struck an officer? Yes. Lieutenant Falton, is there something you'd like to add? I'm sorry, excuse me? Is there some other fact or series of facts that you'd like to privy the committee's attention? Lieutenant Falton... No, ma'am. Come on, man, what the fuck? Can't take the heat? Get the fuck out of the game! Oh, for real, that's how you think... Yeah, that's how I'm gonna play. What the hell is wrong with you? Yo, get off my back, Conrad. Yeah, let me beat the shit out this white boy. This is what I'm gonna use to dig your eyes out of your skull and feed 'em to your homeboys. Now get the fuck outta here. What's wrong with you? Don't you have a hearing tomorrow morning? They're gonna revocate me anyway. There's nothing I can do. No, son, I've seen stranger things happen. I've seen convicts who wore suits to walk be revocated. I've seen convicts who ain't got no business outside that gate get released. The people on that panel are just that. They're people. And all you gotta do is convince one. Yeah. I still got my pride. Oh, man, fuck that. I bet you think you being brave, huh? Stoic. You're not. You're letting yourself become a statistic. Yeah? It's easy for you to say... lifer. Huh, motherfucker, huh? Who the fuck you talkin' to? You think I won't break your motherfuckin' neck right now? I'd give every limb I got for 1% chance at a real life. Or a whisper of hope to take a shit in privacy, huh. Now, if you wanna take the pass, you go ahead and take it, you done this shit before, motherfucker. But don't you dare pretend that that shit is courage. Don't you dare. That's some weak-ass, fake-ass, And you keep playing pussy around here, you gonna get fucked. You got some pretty ass eyes, bitch. Before this committee renders its decision, is there anything that the inmate would like to say? Not too long ago... I saw an inmate kill himself. He was my friend. But I wasn't his, you know? And maybe I could've helped, I don't know. But I'm gonna have to live with that for the rest of my life. And I don't think I've let the people in my life down by making the wrong choices. I think I let them down by convincing myself... I never had a choice to begin with. You're not the first committee to sit at a table and tell me... I deserve to be an outcast. And maybe you're not the last. But for the rest of my life... people will look at me and know I was here. They'll question my integrity... and say I'm a monster. But this... right here... it's different. It's different because for the first time in my life... I don't believe you. Everything you've got written there... I did it. And most of it I regret. But... No. I don't have an excuse. I don't have an explanation. And if that means I need to spend four to six more years before I get another chance... fine. I'm gonna have to live with that too. But I will get another chance. And when I do... I'm gonna fuckin' own it. That's all. This is it. If I see you again... I'mma kill you. When you're so long gone you can't help yourself You can change over there. When you're so dead wrong Let alone no one else Well, the children still dying in the street And babies still living with disease And the cops got guns and poor folks got sons That work for Mr. Franklin every week And if you come lookin' for hard times Hands! Let me see your hands! Hard times ain't hard to find Get on the ground, now! Now! 'Cause we're given that lifeline Only once in a lifetime Baby, we was born Baby, we were born To be sure, to endure When the storm comes Got them sad eyes Got them cat eyes Got your angels tired From saving your life So you would be best To contain yourself Before you end up killed Get his bare feet Touching her bare feet The air breathes sweet At the mountains peak And I forgot What the wise man said About that ancient thread And if you've come looking for hard times Hard times ain't hard to find Cause we Mom. Given that lifeline Only once in a lifetime Baby, we was born Maybe we were born To be sure to adore When storm comes Baby, we was born Maybe we were born Oh, yeah. Um... I wanted to give you a head start. Thank you. Want some chicken? Oh, shit. Get the fuck outta here. Come here, boy. Welcome home. How you doing? Come on, man, what's a guy like you doing working in the dump like this? Just trying to stay afloat. You know it's tough to get a good job with a felony rap. Yeah. But it makes me sad. Listen, I got few things going for me right now. And I can always use good people like you. You say the words, I'll put you on deck. Have you driving a new fuckin' car by the end of the week. No. I'm trying to fly straight this time. Do things right. Oh, okay. Can't help a man out that doesn't wanna be helped. Good luck at finding things you want outta life at $7.50 an hour. Holla at me when you wanna get serious. People give them distractions Robbed and maimed a soul Pain of success Ya head Now just a spit of butter figure way to move it Who the hell are you? I'm James. I was just wondering if Sarah's around. I wanted to talk to her. She doesn't live here anymore. You got engaged. Yeah. Jake's at work. What does he do? Uh, he's a garbage collector. He's a good man. You're happy. Yeah. I'm sorry I didn't visit. You did the right thing. You moved on. Was it horrible? Came through all right. The trick is to find something that you love... and hold onto that... James. I wrote poetry. Everywhere I go in this city I feel like there's something trying to pull me back into my old life. It's harder than I thought it'd be. And I need to get out. Where will you go? Far from here. Start over. New York. I dunno. I can't afford New York, but... James? Yeah? Tell me a poem. Please? Okay. In my mind, there's a boy who exists in chains. Inside a cold, dark room of painful solitude is where he will remain. Behind these walls the sorrow is inevitable, as relentless as the passage of time. Mentalities corrupt and dark, brainwashed, and hopelessly blind. Prisons are packed with crowded spaces, lifers and guards with hollow faces. Shackled hearts afraid of changes, and weakened wills become complacent. Yet, I maintain with patience, time can limit but not shatter my will, strength blazed across my chest as solid as penitentiary steel. But the silence speaks, it tells me all I need to hear, it confirms my beliefs and its promises I have to fear. It reminds me that without freedom, I'm alone. And these whitewashed walls don't make up for blackened souls. I've given 95% of my boys a handshake than a pound, before they were either locked down or buried off in cemetery grounds. What I've done is who I am, but who I am is what I do now. I won't let up or cease to fight. Just time, I plan on doing it right. And what's right lies within me. I'm learning to appreciate my struggle for it would be hard to find the joy of accomplishment without it. We live and we learn. We rise and we fall. Like the heartbeat of a sleeping giant, with bittersweet dreams. Stay up, never down. Well, she won't give in She won't crack a smile or a grin Well, she won't give in But she sure is different Well, it's written in red all in her eyes There's no disguise Well, she lost so much in Tivoli Together we could go home Where they ain't no more pain Here we could fly Where there's time for you and I Together we can walk to the river Stand with the families Pull to sounds of the band from Atlantis One lovely day, one lovely day One lovely day, one lovely day Well, she wanted all The feelings they got so strong Well, she wanted all Then I'm never gonna leave her alone Well, it's written in red all in her eyes There's no disguise Well she lost so much in Tivoli Together we could go Where they ain't no more pain Together we could fly Where there's time for you and I Together we can walk to the river Stand with the families Pull to sounds of the band from Atlantis One lovely day, one lovely day One lovely Day Uh! Is this the first day of the rest of my life or What's the sort of deal, what's to fight for I wrote about every sight sore So I need a reason to write more My pen, I feel I should just put it down And quit music regardless of how good it sounds Just concentrate on my nine to five Finally get that promotion Uh! No more begging people to post my songs Just to have these so-called critics exposed My rooms and ignore my fright Sickness they can't see my vision They got poor eyesight Well, maybe I do Either way I'm proud That I even had a fan to say goodbye to Most of them never even have debt I was not supposed to even have rent But I can support it Oh the stars, on me Still nobody knows my name What it would be If life were the same As that day My dreams had prayed for What it can be Is this the first day of the rest of my career Or is it just the last breath that I can share Uh, I wrote about every dream Every minute of my life Every chapter, every scene Auditioning for the lead Memorized every page But ended up in the audience Staring up at the stage Wishing it was me, reciting all those lines With the audience captivated, listening to me But, uh This audience is full of actors, well Wanna be actors, they can't act as well To all them that stays, the seats are empty Where's all the hip hop fans, they're all MCs So even if I'm better than the rest We're all in the competition So who's there to impress A crowd full of performers lining up in front of me Open mic signing up in front of me Because they wanna be Stars, on me Still nobody Knows my name What it would be If life were the same As that day My dreams had prayed for What it can be Stars, on me Still nobody knows My name What it can be If life were the same As that day My dreams had prayed for
