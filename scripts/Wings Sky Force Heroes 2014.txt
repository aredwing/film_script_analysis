And you're not gonna like it, but I'm gonna tell you anyway. - You wanna hear my story? - Yes sir. Well, the short version is i can't promote you. Yadda yadda yadda, blah blah blah blah. What do you mean you can't promote us? Colonel, we are wings-Down the best team in the sky. Well, that seems to be the case, now doesn't it? But your behavior out there today Was irresponsible and rash. Well, I'm sorry, colonel. It will never ever happen again. - You have my word. Ever. - It won't happen again, huh? You keep saying what you think I want to hear, But if you can't say what's on your mind, son, Then what kind of leader are you? MAN ON RADIO: Emergency, sky force. Power plant's on fire. The fire's four miles across. Most of them tanks burning already. Wind velocity's up at seven knots And 200 planes is trapped inside without fuel. And rescue teams be advised: Fire is dangerous. - (BEEPING) - My intelligence is showing A location of 43 latitude, 78 longitude. Sounds like a job for the Aceman. I know what you're thinking, ace. But you remember the last time When we thought we were gonna get a big promotion, But the colonel got all mad because we didn't wait for the team? Colonel, something's wrong. Those planes wouldn't just be sitting down there for no reason. They must be out of fuel. Come on! COLONEL: Ace, stay in formation. Sky force is not about you. It's about the team. The last thing I ever want to do is let you down, But there's lives to save. I'm... I'm going in! Ace, it's gonna blow. Oh man. This is a very explosive situation. (SCREAMING) COLONEL: Ace, you will stand down! - That's an order! - I know what you guys are trying to say, But that's just not something I can do! I totally agree. 100%. And it's gonna be even more fun when we wait for the team. That's what I'm talking about, Fred. Let's do this! (SQUEALS) This will be a perfect place to just wait... - for the team! - I'm going to swoop in and get a closer look. WINDY: Ace, there's fireballs all over the place. You know how you always make it out alive? Well, That ain't gonna happen. - COLONEL: All right, windy, you're my eye in the sky. - Whoa! Ace, I'm right behind you. Ace, fall in. I can't do that, colonel. I'm sorry, but those planes need us! Whoo-Hoo! All right. All right. Come on. - That's all you've got. - Easy!

It's like who died and made you the head miner? I know. - It's the worst. - Sorry about that, boys. I mean, what's your problem? You're such a loser. I must have added a little extra weight on there accidentally. Eh, don't quit your day job. Hey, you, rookie! What do you think you're doing? This is a runway, not a parking lot. You're either in the air or taking off, so move your tail. - (BANGS) Hustle! - Hey! Oh! (YAWNS) I appreciate the enthusiasm, but you're not built for this. (YAWNS) - Come on, Fred. We just started. We can't just quit every job we get. Uh, first off, we didn't quit any of those jobs. We got fired. Big difference. And second of all, I have to go watch roboball. So if you need me I'll be lying on the couch. - This guy's got two dumb engines. - Thanks, pal. And a one and two and three. - (BRAKES SQUEAL) - Hey, "base," going somewhere?

(LAUGHING) (GRUNTS) This is your last warning, rookie! Next time I'll throw... a bigger book at you! Now get out of my hanger. Whew, the boss is giving us another chance. I think he's finally starting to warm up to us. - BOSS MAN: Check yourself before you wreck yourself. - Oh, you do?! What gave you that idea? The book he threw at your head? Maybe it was his condescending tone, like the one I'm using right now. - Dude, I'm sick of screwing everything up. - (BEEPS) I know I can do this, so let's get back to work and show 'em what we're made of. You're starting to sound like those guys we always made fun of. Why is that? Oh, I know! Because your brain is turning into axle grease. I'm just trying to make the best of it, so if you don't mind... We used to fly with the greats, now look at us. You're living in the past, man. We belong here now. Why can't you get that - Through your little robot head? - My head is not little. For your information, i have an average-Sized robot head. Uh, Fred. - Don't interrupt. I was... Oh ow! - Right behind you. Come on, dude. Pick up the pace. This ain't a parade. - Uh, Fred. - These mining helmets stink! - I'd be safer in a shower cap... Dah! - (GROWLS) - Watch where you're rolling, roller scooter! - Hey. And you, rookie, what are you looking at? Oh, I heard about these geniuses. - Yeah? - You think you're just gonna wheel around here... uh-Huh? ...bumping into everyone like you own the place? - Okay, you got a problem? - Guys, guys. - You better bring it! - He didn't mean anything. - Let your robot speak. - He's just a little tired, that's all. - All this loading and unloading. - He got lucky this time. It was an accident, that's all. Do you know what happens to planes who can't pull their own weight? - Fred, cool it. - Oh yeah? Do you know what happens to planes that talk to me like that? - They get de-Iced. That's right! - Come on, quit it. - De-Ic-Ed. - Dude, give it a rest, will you? - Hmmm. - Come on, stop making such a scene. Well, I'm sure glad we're on the same page. Or do I have to spell it out a little clearer? Oh no, we're all on the same page here, - Mr. Big yellow helicopter, sir. - Come on! Ain't no thing but a chicken wing. Oh, you got some wheel on you, sally. We run the rodeo around here. - So giddyup, buttercup. - (INDIAN ACCENT) Oi! - Hey, stop picking on the rookie. - (ROBOT SQUEAKS) Just because he has a bad paint job Does not mean he's not a cool guy. - Okay? - Just... - stay out of my way or I'll disassemble you. - Uh-Huh. - And your little dog too. - Slow your roll, roller scooter. Hey, what'd you say, girl bike? - ACE: Huh? - Banana seat! Enough, ace. You're not a cargo plane. You're barely a commuter. Open your eyes. This is not who you are. You're a rescue plane. You don't know the first thing about handling loads. No, dude, I used to be a rescue plane. Now I'm a cargo plane. See that? Past tense, Present tense. It's kind of the same thing, But not really. Actually it's kinda the opposite. Not a rescue plane anymore, bro! Got it. What do I care if you want to throw your life away? Don't mind me, I'm just a sidekick robot And I love carrying around boxes in a stupid mine all day. Whatever. Outta the way, fools. Let me show you how... Ugh. (STRAINING) Let me show you how this is done. You don't think I can do it? You don't think I can do it? Whoo! That's what I'm talking about. But but but. Oh, look at the hotshot rookie. Yeah, go for it, boy. Man, I am beat! Ooh, I think I dislocated some landing gear back there. Hey, what do you say we go home, pop open some antifreeze And watch some roboball, huh? Man, that sounds good! Ace, you need to hear me tell you something, And it's not about your brake-Fluid leaking. Dude, I was in a really good mood, But you're seriously being a downer right now. You're not gonna smooth-Talk me this time, you big wingnut. No way. I've had it with this. - Maybe we should spend some time apart. - What? What are you talking about? You're blowing this way out of proportion. You're blowing this way under proportion. - I used to look up to you. - (STAMMERS) Like, "ace is the man! Ace is the coolest!" Now honestly, You're just kind of a dweeb. Let it be, man. Just let it be. Let sleeping dogs lie, man. No no no, ace! No! Sky force is not a sleeping dog. And guess what? Neither am i! What, do you think your exhaust don't stink Just because you used to be on sky force? Sky force is the past. Let me get this straight. - You're saying that no one cares about sky force? - (SIGHS) That's what you're saying? You're saying the words "No" and then "one" and then "cares About sky force"? Is that what... Am i miscommunicating here? Help me out. Well, guess what? Mind your own business, Sucka! Wha... I... I... Oh, who? - (STAMMERS) - (GROWLS) I'm done being your copilot. Well, guess what, bro? Maybe I don't need your help anymore. Ace! Wow. I mean... Wow. After all we've been through? Okay! Okay. That's it, I get it! No more help from me! You're not gonna have this robot to kick around anymore. I don't need you either. (SIRENS BLARING) (LAUGHING) You fly like a blimp! Not so fast, wing tip Willie! - I'm-A gonna get you! - Whoo-Hoo-Hoo! Oh yeah? Well, we'll just have to see about that, Blimpy! Wa-Ha-Ha-Hoo! You'll never catch me, copper! NEWSCASTER: Wing tip Willie was going to turn himself Into the authorities this morning, but then he said, "ha ha, I tricked you" And flew back up into the sky and made off with over 10,000 frequent-Flier miles. So, kids, don't go outside if you see a plane like this Because these are America's Most wanted planes, baby! - Now back to roboball. - Oh yeah, go rivers! Whoo! I love roboball. I'm kinda surprised you're into roboball too, Given the cultural differences... You know, That you're a giant green helicopter. - Actually, roboball is very popular in India. - Whoo! I don't want to toot my own horn, but beep beep. I was quite the champion. Oh, excellent move! - FRED: Oh man! - That was the same move my brother was making - Right before he injured his cockpit. - (BEEPS) Yeah, take him to school, kid! - (GLASS SHATTERS) - Ow. - Wait, where'd the ball go? - Listen. This is getting... Ow! I only have one hanger. Ha ha ha. Uh, you're missing the game! - Come on, Johnson. - ANNOUNCER: Johnson and Beckett. Johnson rolls. He picks, he rolls. - He picks his rolls. - (BEEPS) - And it's good! - And nice shot. Oh boy, I'm very excited about that last move. - Yeah! - I did not see it coming one bit. Yeah, I used to do that move too. Like all the time. I was a total champ on that front. Just ask ace. He'll tell you. - Whoo! - B.T.W., Where is your homeboy? I don't know. Somewhere. But you are his copilot. You should be definitely knowing these things. - That is your job. - Well, maybe it isn't my job anymore. By the way, can I fly with you for a little while? It's not working out between me and ace anymore. Well, I suppose. My copilot is on vacation right now. So actually my cockpit is free. But what about ace? You know, but but but. But-A but but but? I've had it with that clown... For good and that's it. (SIGHS) Hmm? What's that? Wait a sec, are they watching roboball? All right! Oh, it's Fred. - ANNOUNCER: 30 seconds on the clock. - (BEEPS) - Sorry, 28. - Oh boy, this game is really coming down to the wire, As they say. Oh, the anticipation's killing me. Pass it, pass it! Yes. You can do it, come on, man! Yes, go go! Yes! Oh wow. He's really got a handful of wheel on that one. And Johnson at the buzzer! - Fantastic! What a beautiful display of robot engineering. - This is great! I'm so happy! I'm feeling genuinely happy right now. I don't miss anyone named ace. You are not fooling anyone, Fred. Please do yourself a favor and go talk to your homeboy. How do you expect me to talk to him when he's acting like such a meathead? It makes me so mad! You know what I mean? There's no talking to people like that. It's all just moving rocks and boxes. Rocks and boxes, rocks and boxes. What a tragedy. Terrible. Me and ace? You see, we used to be part of this elite Rescue mission squad or whatever. It was called Sky force. Sky force was the greatest force of all forces. Yeah, it was something else. - But but? - But then the accident happened. To make a long story short, the colonel died, Ace blamed himself and now we live in a coal mine. Don't worry, little robot. Everything will turn out just fine. But but but-A but but. Coming up next, a song made famous by a Bulgarian robot. No one knows the name of it, but it goes "mai ya hee." - (POP MUSIC PLAYING) - Oh oh oh. - I love this song. - What a great change of mood. - Yeah, I love this song. - I love this song so very much. - Yes, yeah yeah, whoo! - Oh yeah yeah, do it. - Do it. - Oh yeah. - Okay. - Wah ha, yeah, whoo! - (LAUGHING) - (MUSIC CONTINUES) Ahhh.

Yep, that's where i hold my tension. - Ah, good as... - WINDY: Ace? - Is that really you? - What? - No way! - Windy! Hey there. I haven't seen you in so long. What have you been up to? - You gotta tell me everything. - You know, a little of this, a little of that. You know, stuff. What about you? Still saving lives in the sky. You know how I roll. I've really missed you, dude. Yeah, you know, I'm doing pretty good too. - I got a new job. - Oh really? You flying private now? I've always wanted to fly first class. - So chill. - Mine. - Oh! - Mine? - I work in a mine now. - Oh. That sounds... interesting. So what kind of stuff do you do in this mine? Eh, it's hard to explain. (CHUCKLES) Come on, Bromeister. Tell me about a typical day in your life now. I strap a bunch of rocks to my back Then carry them from one end of the mine to the other. Well, if it makes you happy That's good enough for me. I understand it's not only about the job. It's about the people you work with. That's what really matters most. - On the inside of course. - I had to beg for my job Because my boss wanted to fire me. But it's okay because i told him I'd work for free. Oh, and I get yelled at every day by a giant yellow helicopter. - Mm-Hmm. - Good seeing you again, windy. You're a winner, ace... On the inside of course. You should come back to sky force. (GUITAR MUSIC PLAYING) Ugh, stupid door! (SIGHS) Home sweet home. Remember the time we drove all night Just to end up in a parking lot? - (SIGHS) - Watching the world And waiting for our hearts to stop... - Flat tire. Great. Wonderful ending to a wonderful day. You couldn't hang on so you just gave it up... - (MUTTERS) Come on, where are you? Hey, Fred, where'd you put the tire pump, man? You won't see me cry... Fred! Hey, thanks for leaving this place such a mess, Fred. Those empty barrels really tie the whole hanger together. - (GROWLS) - And I'll be fine 'Cause the sun's gonna shine... Guess I gotta do everything myself! Don't worry, I got it! I'm good! Uh... Oh oh! (GRUNTING) Come on, come on. So take your time and you can tell me what you find But all you're gonna find Is what you left behind... - Wow. My old sky force pics. As if I didn't feel bad enough already. Watching the world and waiting for our hearts... Maybe I could go back. Why couldn't i? Ahh, I can't go back. (MUSIC FADES) (SIGHS) Somebody's just gonna end up getting hurt again. So what's the story with this new quota, huh? - Don't get me started. - Someone was telling me the boss is gonna have us - Work twice as hard for half the pay. - Yeah. I don't even know what that means, but it sounds really bad. - Real bad. - And did you hear about the storm? It's supposed to be the biggest storm in 70 years. - It's insane! - Ow! Don't hit me. I don't know how they know that, but they do. Word on the street is boss man was made out of recycled metal. Come on, I'm running on fumes. Let's go get something to eat. Oh oh. Check out little red riding hood. (LAUGHS) Yeah, did you get lost on your way to grandma's house? Oh, burn. Hey, t-Bone. Boss just hit me on my Cellie. He said we gotta step our game up If we're gonna make quota this week. Relax. I got a plan. And if I ain't got a plan, i got a plan "b." Because I'm always thinking stuff, you know what I mean? - Hey, rookie. - Yes sir. We got a new quota, so stop playing with your landing gear And get ready to go all out, 'cause this new quota's ridiculous, Silly... Heck, it's downright impossible. But that don't mean we can't do it. We just gotta work harder, boys. So what are you thinking? Think something smart, t-Bone. You're good at that. You have a fully functioning brain. - Mine's like a fishbowl. - Calm down. I'mma learn it to ya. Two loads, I'mma take two loads and fly twice as fast. Two?! You can't do two at the same time. But you're the boss, hoss. Two loads at the same time? I'm big! (GRUNTS) - So big. - (PANTS) Here we go. I got this. I got this thing. No, wait, come on. I really do got this. I got it! - Whoo, flyboys for life! - (GROANING) Whoo. I feel fantastic. Like nothing could possibly go wrong today. Hey, Magellan, you want to point me in the right direction? T-BONE: All right, boys, we're gonna take a little shortcut. My pops learned it to me back in the day. It might be a little choppy, so put on those "fasten seat belt" signs. JUMBO: Oh great, i love shortcuts. But but but but but. Good thinking. The sooner we get there, the sooner we get home. Great. Thanks for the update. All right, jumbo, just follow him I guess. This is so much fun, and totally safe! Uh, t-Bone? (MOANS) On second thought I'm having second thoughts. You sound like one of those 'Fraidy cat robots - That my daughter plays with. - (CABLES CLINKING) Are you a robot or a man? COPILOT: Is that a trick question? (MOANING) Get a better grip on the throttle, man. Hey, where do you think you're going, hotshot? What's the matter, big man? Little breeze ruffle your feathers? - Whoo-Hoo! - (STRAINING) How about you just keep a grip on that load Or I'll ruffle you, rookie? Yeah, you tell him, t-Bone. - (ALARM BLARING) - Wah! Fear emotion. This is nothing! Don't get your thrusters in a bunch. - Gah. - (SNAPS) - (BANGS, MOANS) - Hey, what's going on? I can't pull up! My system's out of whack! But-a but-a but but. Stay frosty, t-Bone. We're on our way. (GROANING) (MOANS) What the... (GROANS) My copilot hit his head or something. - I can't steer. - Oh no! T-Bone, quit messing around back there. - You big joker. - I think I made a mistake. (ALARM CONTINUES) - T-BONE: This wasn't a good idea. This was a terrible idea. I confuse the two sometimes. (GROANING) L... I see the light at the end of the tunnel, guys. Tell my sweet little single-Engine Cessna - I love her! - That won't be necessary. Hold on, t-Bone. I'm coming! T-Bone, listen to me! If you want to live, you've got to drop your load now. - (BEEPING) - I can't! I can't do it. (T-BONE GROANS) - I'm trying. - Okay, I got you. I got you. Steady now. Save yourself, rookie! - Don't try to be a hero. - Keep it steady. All right, work with me here, big guy, come on. Come on. Fred, jumbo, where are you guys? We're getting out of this, t-Bone. This is Fred to base. Come in. - We gotta work together. - Fred to base. Base to Fred. Freddie, Basey. Your basic Fred. Are you there, base? T-Bone's in trouble. Requesting permission To drop our load and return to base. Over. Nobody drops their load without my permission, got it? - Do not drop that load! - What's that? I can't hear you over all the evil coming out of your mouth right now. I'll call you maybe. (LAUGHS) Jumbo, you ready to be a hero? Sounds like a plan-Ley, Stanley. We got this. But you gotta let go. It's a very sticky situation. (T-BONE GROANING) Come on, we gotta work together. Jumbo, you're here for a reason. How do we drop his cargo? You have to get to the manual release lever - Located on his back. - It's no use. Don't give up, man. Come on. Here we are, coming to help you. Fred, jump out and grab the lever. You can do it, buddy. - (ALL YELLING) - ACE: My back! Hang in there a little longer, ace. I'm going to release the emergency release that says "emergency release." - Hold steady. - Whatever, Fred, just move. - There's no time. - Hey, look who it is. I see the lever. Just hold still. Sky force 101, class in session. Whoo-Hoo! (GRUNTS) Here goes nothing. I can't reach it. (SCREAMS) If you're gonna do something, Fred, you'd better do it fast. (FRED YELLS) Don't worry, I got this. I can do this. - This is sky force maneuvers. - Hey, man, that tickles. Almost there. (GRUNTING) Gah... Come on. Oh, come on, almost. It's so close, i... I got it... I got it! - I got it. - Come on, Fred! - What am I doing? - (JUMBO GROANS) I really enjoyed working with you guys. All right, on nine. One... two... nine! (ALL YELLING) (ALL CHEERING) (YELLING) - T-BONE: We're alive, whoo! We're alive! - ACE: Whoo! Right on, Freddie. Flyboys for life! Fred? Wait. Fred! - I need a vacation. - Ah, thank goodness! You scared me, man. Don't be doing that! Whoo-Hoo-Hoo! I'd say get in here and hug it out, Aw, but we already did that. You boys are okay. You'd better check your oil pan, t-Bone. - Looks like it's been leaking. - (LAUGHS) - Boy, were you scared. - I wasn't scared! - I have a sweating problem. - Oooh. Now let's get back home before t-Bone here has a heart attack. (ACE, JUMBO LAUGH) (T-BONE LAUGHS) - You said it. - Ay ay aahoooo! Oh. Oh, smile Emoji. Hey, look, the gang's all here. (CHEERING) - T-BONE: There's my cousin Porkchop. And there's meatloaf. Hey, what's up Salisbury? Rib-Eye, how are you fools doing? Hey. Hey. Yeah, all right. I guess I did something right for a change, huh? T. Y... Thank you. T.H.X. And other variations in the form of gratitude. JUMBO: Man, you shouldn't have. Say, you mind if we keep this between ourselves? Aw, don't sweat it, man. I got a reputation to protect. (CHUCKLES) You're a good cargo plane, ace. Whoo, that was crazy! I can't believe you pulled it off. That was nuts, man! I was like, "how is he gonna pull off carrying a five-Ton helicopter with his wings?" And you were like, "Fred, I'm pulling off carrying a helicopter With five-Ton wings," and I was like, "wow, do it, man. You're insane!" But we pulled it off. It was crazy! - I still can't believe it. - All right, guys, save the drama for your mama! - What? - But, boss, we were just... Trying to be a hero. Oh, look at the big hero. (FRED MOCKING) - "I'm gonna go save some lives." Well, we don't want no heroes and we don't need no heroes. Got it, chump? Everyone back to work! Hmm, guess I told him, huh? What... What the hey? Ow! My... Who did that? - You're all fired! - (ACE CHUCKLES) - (POP MUSIC PLAYING) - (VOCALIZING) FRED: Another day in that mine, i was going to lose my mind. Girl, things you never never knew before... Hey, check it out. This is my jam, Stan. Shockball. ROBOT: You look like you know how to play Shockball. It's all in the wrist. Hyah!

A shocking turn of events. - Nice shot! - (GRUNTS) Oh man, the Mathletes are gonna bug out - When they see this. - It's like a giant jawbreaker. You wanna touch it? In your dreams! That looks good. Fred, go win me one of those. Okay, who's up next? Lemme teach you a little lesson in competitive Shockball. - Gimme that. - (CRACKLING) All right, it's all in the suspension. - Focus, ready? - Hit me with your best shot. Steady, fire! (YELPING) - (MOANS) - ROBOT: You missed! No refunds. Store credit only. Wait, where'd the ball go? Hey, ace, you watch what I was doing there? - (KNOCKS) - Listen to me, baby... Maybe if you keep your mouth closed and your eyes open, You might learn a thing or two. Comprende? Watch it, would ya? Would you be careful with that thing? (BANGS) - Stay out of my backswing this time. That's like carnival etiquette 101. - Ready? - (SHUDDERS) Aim. Get a load of this. - What's up, my brothers from other mothers? - Huh? ROBOT: Oh, you missed. - Again. - No no no no no no. No, ah ah! - (CRACKLING) - (ACE SCREAMING) You boys enjoying yourselves tonight? - This place is sweet! - Well, I owe you one. - Yeah. - So why don't you get yourselves some cotton candy, - On me? - Oh boy, I love cotton candy! Delicious. But-A but but but. - Yeah, it's pretty yummy. - (ALL LAUGH) (CHATTERS) FRED: Look, the show is starting. ("MAI YA HEE" PLAYING) Flyboys for life! - Club remix! - ACE: Awesome!

Show them what you've got. - Whoo! Oh yeah, I'm impressed. Whoo! T-BONE: Look at that footwork, eh? Go jumbo, go jumbo, go jumbo. T-BONE: Oh yeah, let me show you how to t-Bone it. Back down, ho ho ha! You're so light on your feet. Yah! And shift! I put the "t" in bone, baby. And twist! T-Bone, aren't you gonna do the Merengue with me? You taught me. - T-BONE: Ha ha! I got it, oh yeah! - JUMBO: Go jumbo, go jumbo. Go jumbo. There ain't any meat on this t-Bone! Whoo! - Yeah! - Wow. FRED: Who knew that'd be fun? ANNOUNCER: Ladies and gentlemen, without further ado, The flying Camacho brothers. - Whoa! - JUMBO: Oh my gosh. They're almost touching bellies! (ALL CHEERING) So incredible. Man, these guys are good and they're going up, up, Up! And now they're going down. How do they do that? Hold on, folks. It's the piggyback tuck and roll! - Flawless! - Maybe I'm just crazy, But isn't that the same move you used to do back in sky force? Yeah, I used to be able to pull off that trick. I bet t-Bone could do that trick in his sleep. - (LAUGHING) - Huh, t-Bone? - Easy-Peasy. - Lemon squeezy? Yeah, you just have to remember to land right. On your landing gear. Ha! Yeah, I remember this one time I went in wheels first and boy, was I racking up frequent-Flier miles. This guy comes out of nowhere like, "what are you doing?" (LAUGHS) - Oh, t-Bone, you are an excellent storyteller. - Tell me more. - He is! - Yeah. - But but but. Hey, ace, let's blow this joint. I want to show you something. Dude, I've seen your wheelie. It's not that impressive. Good night, folks, and safe travels. I'm gonna go buzz the tower. (INSECTS CHIRPING) Whoa. (LAUGHS) It's not so scary when you look at it from up here, is it? Uh, Fred, what are we doing here? Remember the time we drove all night just to end up in a parking lot? After the accident, they shut down that old power plant. It's empty. There's no one down there. I don't know about you, but when I have a problem, I walk right up to it and say, "who's your daddy, problem?" I don't know what that means, Fred. If you're still here 10 years from now, carrying rocks From one side of the mine to the other And watching roboball games at my mom's house, - I'm gonna take your wheels off. - Look, dude, Maybe I like working in the mines. That's just who I am, bro. Dude, you're sitting on a winning lottery ticket. - Uhhh. - You're so money you don't even know it. It would be an insult to guys like me if you're still here in 10 years. You owe it to me to go back to sky force. And more importantly, you owe it to yourself. You know what? Actually, time to saddle up, Freddie. Do you have to do that? Do you have to steal my lines every time? Tell me what you find But all you're gonna find... T-BONE: Here's how it's gonna go down. As soon as ace comes around that mountain, He's gonna see this burning warehouse here. And as a former member of sky force, Instincts are just gonna kick in. I don't know if this was such a good idea. That fire is looking rather dangerous. Well now, jumbo, he's gotta face his fears - If he wants to be a man. - Oh. (T-BONE LAUGHS) - Well, i hope he becomes a man today And not a shish kebab. So you turn to the sky, wondering why But, girl, you gotta stop looking up I like it up here and I'm never gonna drop... Wow, this old power plant's like a ghost town. Maybe this wasn't such a good idea. Ace, times like these, you just gotta keep flying! One wing in front of the other... I mean, uh... One... The wings next to each other... I mean at the same time. You know what I mean. - I don't know what that means. - Ha ha! Well, we're here now, so we might as well make the best of it. And who knows, there might be some planes that need saving. - Over there, for example. - Huh, yeah. Right, like there's some plane stuck in a burning building over there. You never know. Check it out just in case. Yeah, whatever you say. Hey, there is a fire over there! FRED: Go figure. - Here they come, here they come! - Awesome sauce! It's all you, kid. Go get 'em. Someone must be in trouble, eh, Freddie? Better go check it out. (PANTS) Here we go. Time to do what I do. (METAL SCRAPING) I can't! I can't do it. Oh, dude, there's lives to save down there! - Oh, so close. - (T-BONE SIGHS) That was a big bowl of failure. I used to love flying into burning buildings. (SIGHS) What's wrong with me? COLONEL'S VOICE: If I had a nickel for every time I heard that. - Colonel? - Things happen for a reason. C'mere, kid. - (SIGHS) - Sometimes You just gotta fly and not ask why. But why? L... I let you down, colonel. Hey, man, who are you talking to? The colonel. I won't let him down this time. There's someone in danger and I'm going in. Come on, ace. Come on, ace! - (GROWLS) - Come on, be money. - Oh, the tension. - Go go go go go! ACE: Come on. (YELLS) Ya-Aaaa- Hoo-Hoo! - Whoa. - (ACE HOWLING) COLONEL: Nice job, ace. (HOOTS, LAUGHS) Whoo yeah! I can't believe how easy that was. What was I so afraid of? It's like I always say, Flyboys for life. Aaooooo! Thanks, colonel. I needed that. Hey, what am i? Chopped liver? Yeah, you too, buddy. Flyboys for life! - (CHEERING) - Come on, yeah! T-BONE: I like when things work out good. It gives me that warm and toasty feeling inside. Hey, you got any marshmallows? - And graham crackers? - No. - But I did bring s'mores. - Cool! - (GROWLS) - COPILOT: What's a s'more? Where is everybody? They should have been back with those loads At least an hour ago. I just don't understand. Hey, boss, you got a call on line three. Gimme that! Boss speaking. It's a complete white out up here. It's snowing like a dirty diaper. - We gotta get these planes down the mountain. - What?! It's a winter wonderland of snow out there. Make some snow angels, You know, maybe a snowman. Have a snowball fight. Everything starts with snow. I don't know, what else can you do in the snow? Get out there and have fun. Afraid I can't do that. These planes are on thin ice. We're freezing our propellers off up here And it's my job everyone comes home safe. Safe?! Who cares about safe? I don't care about safe. Does anybody care about safe? I have insurance. Ha ha ha ha! How about you do your job, t-Bone? - Or you're fired! - Well... sorry you feel that way, boss. (SIGHS) But what's right is right and you ain't right. This is like the biggest snow storm in 70 years. Winds are at an all-Time high And temperatures are at an all-Time low. It's like a dirty diaper out there and I'm trying to hold on 'Cause I need this job. (SHIVERING) (SNEEZES) (SHUDDERS) Wow, the biggest snow storm in 70 years. 70 years! I'm not built for this. - Hmm? - He's crazy to have us work tonight. Wait, he knows I only have one wheel, right? Remember that time we flew across the canyon And the boss was like, "guys, quit dropping loads!" Yeah, I think t-Bone might be a distant second To all that cargo we threw down the canyon. (BOTH LAUGHING) - 'Cause I know I'm not paying for it. - Dropping loads! I crack myself up. That guy's so weird. T-BONE: The boss doesn't care if we freeze to death up here, But that's not gonna happen. You hear me? Everything will be fine As long as we use the buddy system. (ALL SHIVERING) All right, now everyone find a buddy. Meatloaf, you and gravy go first. JUMBO: I sure do love the buddy system. It keeps you warmer. T-BONE: Porkchop, sarsaparilla, move out! - But but but but. - No plane left behind. - Porterhouse, where are you, big guy? - No left plane behind. Hustle hustle hustle! (RUMBLING) Okay okay okay, keep it moving, folks. Nothing to see here. Oh, focus, focus! T-BONE: Go go go! Move move move! Whoa, go back, go back, go back. JUMBO: Hustle hustle. Absolutely no left plane behind. No right ones either. Okay, now this was a bad idea. We gotta get everyone back inside. - FEMALE VOICE: Help. Help me. - JUMBO: You hear that? - Do you? - Help? It sounds like someone is in trouble. (ALL MOANING) My wheel's stuck. I don't want to go to airplane heaven. (MOANS) This isn't good. Don't worry, cheesesteak, I'm coming! 93, 9... Jumbo! Where's jumbo? Jumbo, where are you going? Get back here, that's an order! Beep beep, excuse me. Pardon me. - Out of the way, Porkchop. - Sorry, hello, thank you. - Jumbo's coming! - (YELLS) Watch it, oh god. Oh boy. Don't worry. Watch out. Right in front of you. Whoa. Almost got it. - (SCREAMS) - Jumbo to the rescue! - I got you. - Whoa-Oaaa! - (LAUGHS) Hey! - But who has me? Help-Ppp! T-BONE: Not today, cheesesteak. (STRAINING) Not today. You're gonna live. (GROANS) I got you. - I got you. - (PANTING) - He was so brave, but unfortunately... - Get back inside! ...he went to airplane heaven. (SOBBING) - Get inside. Jumbo, you down there? I can't see you, buddy! We gotta get back inside, jumbo! (GRUNTING) Oh no. Everyone back inside now! The whole mountain's about to come down. (ALARM BLARING) Wait. Wait wait, don't close it yet. Here I come. Hold the gate. I'm coming. Wait wait wait wait! Wait, guys, I'm still outside. - Come on, t-Bone. - Oh, hurry hurry! - I'm gonna make it. - Come on, you can make it. Whoa, dude! Did you feel that? It's probably just the boss making an example of someone. Hmm hmm. - Uh... - I'm sick of hanging around the hanger all the time. Let's go do something. (CLATTERING) - FRED: This storm is crazy, man. - ACE: Whoa. - Did you check the traffic report? Maybe not. Maybe we should stay inside and play a board game. This is totally stupid. (LAUGHS) Brrr! Oh, come on. Ah, cold cold cold. Come on, up! Whoa! (ROBOTS YELLING) - Everyone stay focused. - Ahhh! Ahh, wha? Ahhhh! Better shut the gate. Whoa-Aaaa! Oooh ahhh oooh ahhh. Oh oh oh. - (TIRES SQUEAL) - Coming in cold! - Hey, look out! - BOSS MAN: Rookie! - Who, what, where? - Rookie! - (PANTING) - What are you doing here? It's really coming down down there. I hope everyone's okay. What, are you a weatherman now? Keep it moving, chump! I think you might want to shut the whole mine down - Till the storm blows over, you know? - Uh-Huh. (LAUGHS) Think you might want to mind your own business. Now fly away, little birdie. Fly away. Boss man, apparently there's a bunch of planes stuck up on the mountain. - Don't kill the messenger! - Seriously? - Let's go check it out, Freddie. - What? - Those planes might need our help. - Don't you dare Try to be a hero, rookie. Last time you cost me an entire shipment of coal. - An entire shipment! - Man, someone needs to teach you a lesson. - Don't you even care what happens to them? - No. (ANGRY STAMMER) I can't take it anymore! I quit! Just like you quit sky force, right? You big poopie head! You let your old boss down, Your team down because you're nothing but a loser! A lah-Hoo-Hoo-Ser! Ha ha ha, yeah, that's pretty funny. Oh hey, I got a little something for you. - I've been saving it up. - Huh? - Oh no... (COUGHING) - Take a sniff of this! Gross! Come on, Fred. There's lives to save! (MOANS) Ow. How dare they throw the book at me. What? What are you looking at? - Huh? - (EVIL CHUCKLING) You wouldn't hit a robot with glasses, would you? - Ow ow ow! - (LAUGHING) That's... Ow! Dude, you sure about this? Yeah, this is what we do, right? The colonel always had a plan. Even if he didn't have a plan, that was his plan. Hmm, oh well, I guess we'll have to wing it. That was his plan... To not have a plan. Plus the weather's probably gonna be an issue, too. On second thought... Fred? - Maybe we should call for backup. - Huh? Are you saying what i think you're saying? That's right, Fred. This is a job For sky force. I'm not getting through. I keep calling, but it's going straight to voicemail. - Should I send a text? - Send a text! - Girls never answer their phone. - Oh, that makes sense. We gotta work together. It's time for a throwback, Freddie, To when things were awesome! Awesome sauce front and center. You've got this, guys. We're counting on you. (EXHALES) Haw! Oooyah! (WIND BLOWING) (MOANING) Where am i? T-Bone? He left me all alone. I'm scared, t-Bone. Oh, ratchet? Ratchet, wake up. Wake up, ratchet. Oh ah oh uh hi. (GROANS) - Shock. - What are we gonna do, man? We're trapped. It's f-F-Freezing. This reminds me of the time I was walking through a herd of cows. Whoa whoa! Hold on, Fred! Hang on to your hats and glasses. Ace, be careful. The wind isn't letting up! Whoa, what a mess! It's kind of like a dirty diaper. How the heck are we gonna get in there? (YELLS) (GROANING) (TIRES SQUEALING) Oh whoa! Whoo! (SIGHS) T- Bone! Jumbo! Anybody home? (YELLS) Whoa! - Careful. - This is crazy. Let's check the perimeter. They've gotta be around here someplace. - Let's do it. Come on! - Hoo-Ah! Anybody! Hello! Where are you guys? - (SIGHS) - Careful. We're all gonna shut down if we don't get some fuel in here. - Yeah, and the bathroom's not working either. - Wait, come back! - (MOANS) - Here, drink some gas. - It's unleaded. - Does anybody know how to work this radio? Hello! Oh. Oh oh! Huh?! T-Bone? Hold on, I'm gonna get you. (GRUNTING) Come on. - Ace, it's t-Bone! - Huh? - (GRUNTS) - (TIRES SQUEAL) - What happened to him? - T-Bone's trapped.

(PANTING) (WEAKLY) Ace. - Is that you? - We're getting you outta here, brother. They're all inside, trapped in the mine. You gotta do something, buddy. Ace, don't forget about me. Flyboys for life, right? You're getting out of here, okay? You listen to me. Gah! How'd you get stuck in here anyway? Come on, t-Bone! Ace. What should we do? Think, ace. Come on, think. (SIGHS) - (PROPELLERS WHIRRING) - Huh? Wait a minute. Is that... Up there! Whoo-Hoo-Hoo! Got your text, bro. - ACE: Awesome! - FRED: Whoo-Hoo! WINDY: Ace, I've really missed you, dude. - Windy, I missed you, girl. - Yeah! WINDY: We can't land with these winds, dude. And that runway is pretty much gone. All this snow can give way any second. This is like avalanche central up in here. (MOANS) We're gonna freeze to death. (SHIVERING) - Where'd that rock come from?! - Okay okay. Don't fill up your oil pan just yet. Help is on the way, okay? And we're done. All right, t-Bone, it's time to blow this popsicle stand. Gunner, let's hoist This bad boy up up and away. (MOOING) Uh. (STATIC BUZZES) - Man, this radio just doesn't want to work. Wait, what... What's that? - Huh? - Wait, do you hear it? - What? - RATCHET: Noises. - (PROPELLERS WHIRRING) - Oh oh, is it... It's... They're here! Help is here! Yay! I got it! Hey, windy, silly question, - But did you bring any bombs with you? - Uh, no. Why do you ask? Well, the only way that door's gonna open Is if we blast it open. Okay. Maybe Hudson has some. Hudson? You got any bombs, bro? (LAUGHS) Funny you should ask that. I do. WINDY: Ace, i can't get a read on your location. I'm going to disconnect my tracking device So you can hone in on the exact location To detonate the bomb. Fred, hurry up back there. We don't have much time. They're gonna be here any second. - (CLANKS) - (BEEPING) 500' from the mine and closing. Hudson, let's deliver that bomb, big guy. - You can do it, bro. - Yeah, duh. Like we've never dropped a bomb before. - Ain't no thing with a chicken wing. - That's what I'm talking about. HUDSON: Oh yeah, I'm the boss. Are you sure about this? At this point it all comes down to faith and trust. I thought you were gonna say pixie dust. WINDY: It's time to detonate, Suckas! - Oh goodie. - You're at 400'. Soon you'll be at 300'. After that you'll probably be at 250. That's 250! - Here comes 200. - Ow.
