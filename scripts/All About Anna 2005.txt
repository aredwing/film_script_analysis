I've got one, I've got one! It was too good to be true, of course. Johan's need for adventure pulled him off to the Arctic. He was going to be away for three months. After a couple of months I stopped receiving letters. That was five years ago. Once I had a sweetheart and now I have none once I had a sweetheart and now I have none he's gone and left me he's gone and left me he's gone and left me to sorrow and mourn last night in sweet slumber I dreamed I did see last night in sweet slumber I dreamed I did see my own precious jewel sat smiling by me my own precious jewel sat smiling by me but when I awakened I found it not so but when I awakened I found it not so my eyes like some fountain with tears overflowed my eyes like some fountain with tears overflowed once I had a sweetheart and now I have none once I had a sweetheart and now I have none he's gone and left me he's gone and left me he's gone and left me to sorrow and mourn. Tired of crying over Johan, I had learned my lesson. I was going to master my emotions. I was not a victim of love. From now on, it was going to be all about fun. From now on, I would be living life to the hilt. It worked. Strangers without strings. No commitment, no casualties. Although one of them tagged along: Frank. He was sweet and steady. He took good care of me. Hi Mum, it's me, Frank. I have a very good friend staying with me. She's got a bad headache. What do I have to do about it? You know, a cure or something like that. A what? Aspirin? OK. Hey! The sex was good, the conversation fine and, thank God, - - Frank didn't have an adventurous bone in his body. My guard dropped. When I got a new flat - - I was close to letting him move in. Hi, darling. Wait a minute. I just have to finish the upper part here. I'm not really sure about this. I think I'll go with the white. Can you...? Anna? I was thinking about... What if I... you know? Come on, Frank. This does look like diarrhoea. And now you do. Shit! Oh shit, it's for me. The first one to call my flat. I wonder who it could be. It's Frank. Oh, hi Mum. Yeah, sure. All right. Bye. I thought we said twelve. Johan was back. See you. Gotta run. A blast from the past. What are you doing here? I thought I'd never see you again. Let's just say I've had my fill of adventure. Are you going to help me, or what? - Where do you want this? - Oh, I don't know. I really didn't expect you this early. Looks like I'm a few years too late. - Was that the lucky guy? - Frank, he's... he's not... Stop flirting with the customers. We're late. My loss. Gone as suddenly as he came. A mirage from my lost love life. I figured I'd never see him again. I really tried to keep up the thing with Frank. But I had this feeling. I told him he couldn't move in, to protect him as well as myself. Right? Putting up that ad was the beginning of the end. Hi, Anna. What are you doing? I thought you said you needed to be alone. 50 people called, but I chose the one single woman - - who shared my views on love and commitment: Camilla. Hello, darling! I know I haven't moved in yet, - - but welcome to our housewarming! Surprise! Sorry to drag you away from your party. That's OK. It was actually starting to annoy me. Look, I know this sounds a bit corny but... I don't suppose this belongs to you, does it? I found it in the back of the van. Well then, let's see if it fits. So... Would you like a beer? You're missing the party. Who's this man? I know this is technically trespassing, but... I felt bad about leaving last night. Anna? - Are you making some coffee? - Yeah... - No, I'm about to have a shower. - Why don't you join me first? Fuck! See this? Frank had no idea whose phone number he erased. He meant well. Still, I used the incident as an excuse to break up. I figured a clean cut was best for both of us. Can I talk with Johan, please? But you do! He moved my stuff just two days ago. Can I leave him a message? Can you get me his phone number? But I'm an old friend! I'm gonna treat this poor single woman to a night on the town. Here's my dress. The one Carlos bought me in Rome. The one I told you about. The one with the little penis. It doesn't fit me in the boobs. They're too swollen at the moment. But it'll fit you. - Thank you, but I'm not in the mood. - It'll look great on you! It's a real guy-puller. Do you know how many times I've been fucked in this dress? Every time I go out: Whoa, someone's there. - Champagne? - I just need to get organised, OK? Whatever. I'm going out. What about the washing up? This is not a hotel. Careful you don't start sounding like my mother. I could have tried harder to find Johan. But hey, he was the one who knew where I lived. Obviously, this was just another adventure of his, - - and I wasn't crying over him again. If it could be a bit more... Good, hard, honest work can take your mind off anything. I'd designed the costumes for a small play that was a huge success. One night, this French guy was visiting the theatre. ...at the end of Act II I fell down the stairs. Everyone was laughing. - This is Pierre Gaultier. - The top name at the Palais Royale. This is Miss Olsen, who plays the captain's first wife. - How lovely. - It's an honour to meet you. - And who is this lovely creature? - This is Anna, our costume designer. - Enchant. - Nice to meet you, too. Mr. Gaultier is artistic director at the Palais Royale. - In Paris? - Oui, my flower. Your work is magnifique. I want you to make costumes for our next play. - Me, in Paris? - Can you make big birds? I want feathers and wings and beaks. That depends. Making flashy costumes just for show - - doesn't really challenge me. A costume should be an extension of the character... ...and show the audience who the character is inside. That's what inspires me. Perhaps if you told more about the play? Take my card. I will meet you tomorrow to discuss the details. I'll call you then. Of course, the next day we had excellent reviews, - - and I could find sponsors all over France. Pierre's offer wasn't only a career move, but an opportunity to do - - what was best for me. A chance to get away from loud girlfriends - - and old lovers, who popped up when they felt like it. Why wouldn't I say yes? - So, do you want the job? - Yeah, please. I love birds. She's a bird with fancy feathers walking through the room local lady of design who makes all your costumes she will write you on a ticket take you for a ride wake up in the morning will she be there by your side? We're going all the way, all the way all the way birds of a feather flock together you and me, I say some say she's connected and Bowie's in the car she's got a set of white long legs you know that gets you far there's money in the picture a picture you can't see birds of a feather flock together you and me all the way, let's go all the way, let's go all the way, let's go all the way birds of a feather flock together you and me, I say birds of a feather flock together you and me, I say let's go all the way let's go all the way - Oh, Albert. Do you want to suck? - I am. - Oh, please. - "Oh, please. " My very serious and very busy friend doesn't want to be disturbed. Maybe she can join us? She's working. Oh Albert, come on! Do you want to take them off? You've got the best buttocks. Lick me. I want you to suck me and lick me. Do I look sexy? Do I look sexy now? I'm gonna to be two minutes. You're gonna fuck me? - Do you promise? - Absolutely. - You won't be asleep? - No. Just a sec. Are there any condoms? Albert, help me. Help me! Albert, I want the Tower of Pisa. Albert, I want it big. I want it big. Too much noise. Albert, for the first time - - you're... I wanna be fucked. It's a log. Oh, God. Oh Albert, I love you. Do it this way. Oh yeah... Oh Albert! That'll be nice. You can pick me up at the airport Charles de Gaulle... Anna! I met this guy... I look forward to work with you, too. No, I talked with them yesterday. Thank you. OK, goodbye. Au revoir. - I met this handsome guy at the gym. - So Albert is history now? No. But he needs a place to stay, so I said my flatmate was going away. That's fine by me, as long as you take care of it all. Thank you, God! This guy will make your mouth water! Tell Mr Mouthwatering that he can rent my room while I'm away. He can pick up the keys on Saturday. I love you! If I'd known the true identity of this Mr Mouthwatering - - I'd never have said yes. - I know a trick. - What's keeping him? - What if he can't find it? - Relax. He's smart and he's gorgeous. And you can count on him. Have a wonderful trip. Enjoy the spring, and not least the Parisian gentlemen. OK, I'll try. Ace! It's open! - I'm just about to leave for Paris. - I know. Camilla told me. - I'm here for the keys. - Keys? Of course. I'm really confused. - I'd better show you around. - Yeah. Didn't get much of a tour the last time. That's Camilla's shelf, that's yours. You can make up a different system if you want, you and... Camilla. Jesus, Johan! What are you doing here? You never called. I couldn't stop thinking about you. I lost your number. I tried to find it, but... I don't know what annoyed me most. Him appearing from nowhere. Again. Or him sharing my flat with Camilla. No! I can't do this. You disappear for five years and now you want to move into my flat? - Yes... - No. No. You can't work on something, look forward to something, - - invest all your energy in something like I did, - - then put it on hold because an old lover blames you for never calling. On the other hand, this was the perfect test. If Mr Mouthwatering could live in my flat for three months - - without giving in to Miss Man-eater, - - then maybe I could trust him again. But his odds were low. Ah, Anna! Welcome to Paris. And welcome to my theatre. Did you have a pleasant flight? Paris was just what I needed. A new beginning, a change of scene. I made friends with one of the actresses: Sophie. Sophie was strong, self-assured and single by choice. Exactly the person I needed to be around. Did I miss life back in Copenhagen? Why would I? Can you please take off your sweater? Thanks. And raise your arm. You have to do me now. The director needs me all day. - I have to finish here first. - It's OK. I can come back later. - Selfish bastard! - Cunt! - Your costumes are just magnifique. - Thank you. You can come a long way in France, with the right support. I feel I see who you are and what you need, you know? - I'm not quite sure I do. - I could make you very successful. - A very happy woman. - Thanks, but I'm doing fine. I think you should start trusting your feelings. Like we do in Paris. What feelings? You don't know who I am! You cunt! You loser... Merde! I thought we'd talked about you using my bathrobe. - I'd prefer it if you didn't. - If you insist. Sit down! - You can keep it on for now. - Sit down, please. Sit down. Champagne? - Whoa, baby! - What are we celebrating? We're celebrating that we've been living together for a month. Almost. OK... To being flatmates for a month. - Almost. - Sit down, please. So, what are we having, then? - Having? - Dinner? In the oven! Did you like what you just saw? Yes. You're a very attractive woman. But I think we should just keep it as flatmates. Having a good time doesn't have to change anything. You have needs, and I have needs. What would be more sensible than to try and fulfil those needs - - in the comfort of our own home? - I don't think this is gonna work. - Sit down! Turn off your brain... ...and relax. Camilla, I don't... Just relax. - Camilla... - Shhh! Sorry! Sorry. I guess it's time for a shower. - Hi, Camilla, it's me. - Anna! - You sound so close. Are you back? - No, I'm way too busy here. Yeah, doing great. - I just wanted to check. - Don't worry about us. We're fine. Everything is fine. - What's up? You sound strange. - I can't talk now. He's here. - Johan? In your room? - No. Oh, good. So who's there? Are you still fooling around with Albert? No. - A new lover? - No. And my other tenant? Is he seeing someone too? I bet you're building a little love nest. I mean, separately. No, I don't think he's seeing anyone at the moment. I just really miss that bastard. - Johan? - No, for Christ's sake! Albert. Oh, sweetie! Why don't you sort things out with him? - Because I think it's too late. - It's never too late. If you like him so much, why don't you commit yourself? You know, it's probably just some sort of misunderstanding. Oh Camilla, now you got me going too. Hey... silly me. I can be such a wise-ass. Didn't I realise I was talking about myself? Apparently not. I needed one more push. And that push came from an unexpected place. May I come in? Are you all right? - Entrez. I'm almost done. - Sure? We used to be lovers. Can you believe that? You and Pierre? Yes, I know. I thought he was the love of my life. Are we talking about the same person? - Yeah. Unfortunately. - What happened? - L'amour rend aveugle. - What? It means that when you're in love, you're blind. Ow! - Do you like life here, Anna? - Yes, Paris is a big break for me. That's not what I asked. Show me your finger. Don't be afraid. Just when I think it's over between us, - - he's back in my face. And I can't say no. I've got to stay out of that crap. It's gotta be fun, for Christ's sake. Right? It's gotta be fun, right? It's gotta be fun, right? Fun's OK. - Maybe fun's not enough anymore. - You're a romantic! So that's why! I've met romantics before. She's got to be special. - She is. - So there is someone. I knew it. Who is she? - You know her. - I know her? Oh, my God! It's Anna. Did all that happen when you came to get the keys? No. We go back a long time. I fucked it up. And? It's getting too complicated. I've decided to move out. Don't worry, I'll cover you for the rent. But that's unfair. I didn't know about you and Anna. - You're not to blame. - Can I stay here tonight? I can't sleep if I have to be alone. No hanky-panky. Scout's honour! I have to go, Sophie. Sophie's sweet caress showed me I had to break the vicious circle. If not, - - Johan and I would end up like Pierre and Sophie. Lonely, bitter, - - spitting harsh words at each other. I understand. Forever seeking comfort in strangers. So much for wanting to break the vicious circle. If Camilla was a trap, he'd walked right into it. Told you his odds were low. I was never, ever going to expose myself like this again. Are you OK? Come on. It's OK. I was too drunk to worry about it. But really. What were the odds I'd be scooped up by that other removal guy? I couldn't take a step without being reminded of Johan. - So, what's up? - Yeah, what's up? Well, let me think. Just screw the brain out of me. So, you really moved my stuff? Yeah, two hours or something. I just need to move this piano. See you, honey. Yeah? Yes... Yeah, OK. - What are you doing? - Hey, OK... - You're sick. Sick! - Hey, sorry, OK? I know this is awkward, but I'm just back from Paris and I... I just thought... Can I come in? No, this is a bad idea. I really feel bad. You were so good to me, and I just didn't... I know I've completely screwed up, but if you'll forgive me... Anna, please don't! I don't blame you for not daring. I probably wasn't right for you. Daring? What are you talking about? If a guy showers you with eternal love, suddenly you're suffocating. If he doesn't, it's what you want, isn't it? You're so scared of losing, you never invest yourself in anything. Well, except your damn work, of course. I just wanted to... Anna, please. Just tell him what he means to you, - - or you'll spend the rest of your life thinking love hurts. - But... how do you know? - Good night, Anna. And good luck. What if Camilla and Johan had already planned their future? What if she'd love to have babies and he said he'd never leave her? In my flat! Frank was right. I had to conquer my fear of defeat. I had to risk the pain. I had to go back into that flat. Johan? - Johan, I have to talk to you. - You see any fucking Johan in here? Anna! Christ! What happened? Oh, my God, Anna... Had I just blown all chances of ever seeing him again? Apparently, Johan had left the flat to go to some boat. Of course! The boat! His ticket to adventure. We decided to put the last five years behind us. From now on - - it was going to be all about us. She gets what she wants almost every time boys flock around her and form a hungry line she tried a few out but it really didn't work Frank was a nice guy but the rest of them were jerks is it all about you or all about me or all about a girl named Anna is it all about you or all about me or all about a girl named Anna she moved away to Paris where her life was a dream she met a lot of people and all of them were keen when something isn't right even fools know it's wrong she was hopelessly in love with Johan is it all about you or all about me or all about a girl named Anna is it all about you or all about me or all about a girl named Anna she pulled herself together and split without goodbye the others could forget her she was hooked on just one guy if you want a happy ending one is on the way listen to your heart and what it has to say is it all about you or all about me or all about a girl named Anna is it all about you or all about me or all about a girl named Anna.
