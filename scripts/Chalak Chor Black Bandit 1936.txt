You are going in the wrong direction. Before you bumped into me, you were going in the other direction. And now you're walking with me. No, you're going in the wrong direction. You were going in that direction. What are you doing in this direction? You look decent. What are your intentions? Aren't you ashamed of yourself? I made a mistake. Crazy man ! I am coming ! You see? Didn't I tell you? Tell me. What do you want? Why are you following me? Excuse me. You tell me which direction to go in? The direction which you took earlier. That way. Go. Fine. Sickening behavior. Okay. Fine. That's all I have. It's not enough. You want to go to America and that's all the money you have. Give it to me. Dad's court date is tomorrow. This was promised to the attorney. No. Forget the promise. Tell the attorney to get his own money. I won't give you this money. You can't use this money for the court case. It'll be wasted, don't you understand. You're wrong. A teacher contributes towards a country's future. The country can't ruin his gift to her. I am sure we will win this case. As soon as the court compensates us. . . . . .I will repay your every penny. Do you know it's Rs.35,000 now? Do you understand? I am grateful. I take the trouble to arrange the money. . . . . .and you assume a position of greatness. Hey, I am telling you that I am grateful to you. If you're great, what does that make me? Fool. This is for protecting my family and winning the case. You're embarrassing me. No. In fact, I want to apologize. The hearing is tomorrow. And I am paying your fees today. Your father taught my kids too. Let me have the honour of making this right. It's regretful that in spite of living together. . . . . .your brother-in-law wants to take your father to court. Until now I have been quiet, but not any more. How can he take our father to court? Isn't he ashamed to fight his father-in-law? What can I do about it? Not like he'll listen to me Our father was a teacher for forty years. He is highly respected in society. No pension, no gratuity. Now he has to fight for the cause of justice. You won't support your family. Tomorrow is the hearing. My brother-in-law could withdraw the case if he wants to. Knock some sense into him. Deepak. . . You've made me a saint. How? Actually, I want you to win. . . . . .but I have to fight on behalf of the school. Professional ethics. How could I ever forget. . . . . .that it's you who has educated me. I can't also forget that twenty years ago. . . . . .when the school needed a legal advisor. . . . . .you chose me for the post? And for my daughter as well. I don't have any grievances against you, Vinayak. You fulfill your duty. I'll fulfill mine. Would you explain this to Deepak as well. He is immature. He's unable to get a sense of your greatness. Uttam, you are sitting on a bomb. Bomb! Yes. Where's the bomb? Where is it? Bomb. Bomb. Run ! Everybody, run. There's a bomb! Listen to what he has to say. Sit. It's nothing. I am talking about real-estate. The price of land. . . Sorry! Sorry! The price of land is escalating. I know that. Tell me. What's the current price of that house? What! What! Sell the house as soon as possible. Our municipality is unpredictable. They will broaden the road. They will build a flyover. And prices will come tumbling down. No, no. Prices won't fall. They won't. We will sell that house without a doubt. Brother, tea. Orange juice. You're showering so much love. Come to the point. Are you allergic to money? No. Why? You think my husband is a fool. So what if I think so? Kriplani. Kriplani. Please don't talk about selling the house again. Kriplani is paying a good price. Dad laid the foundation of this house. This house was built not with his money. . . . . .but with his blood and sweat. This room was. . . . . .once upon a time, a maternity ward. We were all born here. Mum sang to us here. Whenever I sleep here, I sleep peacefully. This house is priceless. I can't sell it. The Principal of Malaviya Memorial High School. . . . . .Mr. Omkarnath built a library six years before he retired. It was in the best interest of the students. However, he built the library without the permission. . . . . .of the school committee. The school in turn, incurred a loss of 2 million. To compensate for the loss, the school committee didn't pay. . . . . .Mr. Omkarnath's monthly wages for over six years. No pension. . . . . .or provident fund which amounts to 1 million including interest. . . . . .on the basis that the school is facing a financial problem. I have seen the school's accounts for the last seven years. It's clear the school doesn't have money. So its really impossible to pay the one million. . . . . .which Mr. Omkarnath demands. But no school committee can deprive a teacher. . . . . .his monthly wages, pension and provident fund. I beg your pardon, Your Honour. You are talking of offering water from an empty glass. In fact Mr. Omkarnath should compensate us. . . . . .for breaking the rules of the school committee. At least 2 million five hundred thousand. After spending so lavishly on the library. . . . . .the school's financial condition is very bad. . . . . .and it has not recovered yet. The accounts are in front of you. Have a look. Don't try to twist the matter, Mr. Vinayak. So what if there's no money? The school will have to compensate with property of the same value. This is the court's decision. What property does the school have, My Lord? Chairs, tables, blackboards, chalks. Do you want that? Tell me. My Lord, the school has a bus. If it's acceptable to them, they can take the bus. Do you want the bus? Tell me. Instead of money, they want to give us a bus. This is injustice? We need an elephant. . . . . .but if they don't have one they. . . . . .give us mice equivalent to the weight of an elephant? Isn't it strange? It could be useful. They are giving us a bus which is in working condition. I'm confused. The court's decision is no different compared. . . . . .to the laughter of an insane man. The way an insane man would laugh looking at us. We know that his laughter means nothing. After visiting courts for years. . . . . .and wasting so much money, what did we get? A bus. That's it. You've become so pessimistic. What do you mean pessimistic? You don't understand. There is an English proverb. Every dark cloud has a silver lining. We can't sell it. The Kohinoor is in London, how is that useful to us? Why are you talking about London? Talk about what we have. Look. This. Assume that I sell the bus and get 5 million. I give you 1 million I give 1 million to my attorney. I have to pay you 32 If we take a round figure then. . . Yes. I will earn 3 million. From which I give you 1 million to go to America. How much do I have left over? Look. What? I didn't think of that. Take this. Take this. Cheers! Where do I put this? We will have to make an announcement in the paper. What! It was not a big case that we will have to. . . . . .announce our victory in the newspaper. I'm not talking about the case. I'm talking about the bus. Only after we give an advertisement. . . . . .will we be able to sell the bus and get money for it. And it will be divided into three parts. At times I feel if I had many hands and feet like Gods and Goddess. . . . . .then distribution would have been easier. How is your furniture business going on? Father, I've heard contractors these days. . . . . .chop trees without taking permission. I don't understand it. Before that you taught in a junior college. You left that job too. You know. They pay you Rs.7000. And they make you sign for Rs. 15000. When I opposed them. . . They sacked you. Yes. Now you have to give another exam. Rajshri Production's Vivaah. Do I have to watch it? Not this. Below that. Route permit. From Sonawadi to Ratnagar Chowk. This is for what? For the bus. But Father, I don't know anything about this business. Once you jump into the water, you will learn to swim. Look, listen to me. Don't sell the bus. Drive it. You will earn something. It will be convenient for the people. I think you will like this job. If you say so. Look, a bus has 60 seats. On an average one seat costs Rs. 10. If the bus is fully booked then one trip will fetch us Rs.600. From twenty four hours we work for eighteen hours. One trip takes three hours. So in eighteen hours we can make six trips. If we earn Rs.600 from one trip then six trips will fetch us Rs.3600. If we earn Rs.3600 in a day then. . . . . .we will earn Rs.25000 in a week. If we earn Rs.25000 in a week then. . . . . .in a year we will almost earn 12 million. If we earn 12 million from one bus. . . . . .then our earnings will be in millions if we have five to six buses. I am not good in math's. What's the overall amount? Overall it's around hundreds of millions. You want to go to America? You want to? I will go to America. What happened? I will go to America. Have you gone mad? Come on ! People will hit us! We will get the money later. . . Look. What fun ! What fun ! We don't want to buy plants from a nursery. We've come for the bus. Come on. This is the bus. Is this a bus or a birds nest? Why is it covered in plants? Is it a wedding of tribal's? This can't be the bus, Deepak. Call the principal. Look, firstly this is the same bus. . . . . .which Vinayak Agarwal said to give to you. Secondly, the Principal is on leave today. Thirdly, quickly sign here and fourthly. . . Are you making children do an exercises? How much more are you going count? What did you say? 10 to 12 million in a year. If I sell it in a junkyard then forget all the millions. . . . . .I won't even be able to buy bangles for my mother. Look, something is better than nothing. It's good. What is good? What are you doing? What are you doing? I've seen folding sofas. This is the first time I've seen a folding bus. It doesn't have tyres. The school should at least give us tyres. Why will the school give it to you? Pay from your own pocket. Does a person carry tyres in his pocket? The court has ordered the school. . . . . .to give us a bus. So? So a bus has tyres. A school bus even has children. From where do I give you children? I don't need your help with that. I will help myself. Yes. Now I understood why your brother-in-law was smiling. . . . . .even after the court decided to give us a bus. It's all your brother-in-law's doing. Brother-in-law will go mad. Now what do I do with this coconut? Shall I break it on my head? Take this. Make coconut curry at home. Before I could start my business, brother-in-law has. . . I can give you Rs. 10,000 for this gold. Okay. You. . . Rs. 10,000. You. . . I told you Rs. 10,000. Uncle! Is this enough for you? It's not about that. God save me. Give it to me. I will earn that much pretty fast. I will repay the loan. Give it to me. God, save me. Come on. Uncle, I asked papa for the bus's name. He said, Chal ( Get out). My papa also said, Chal. I don't understand one thing, Father. Why do they always humiliate me? Forget them. Use your brains. Superb! I've found the way to success! They said Chal. You said Chala Chal. So the bus's name will be Chal Chala Chal ( Keep Moving ). It's good ! Everyone's happy. Why are you sulking? My brother is going to start his bus business. Be happy. Your brother is going to start his bus business. Should I be dancing? The veneration is on over there. Why are you reciting the prayer here? We have to take a fitness certificate from the RTO office. We will flatter him. So? We will make him break the coconut. I see. He will be happy if I gave him that honour. Say it politely. I should break the coconut? Why are you hesitating? Break the coconut. You too are a part of our family. Coconut. I will break the coconut. Praise God ! Dance. Don't say stop. Sing. Don't say stop. Sway. Don't say stop. Sway. Don't say stop. Life is short. The trip shouldn't end. Control it. Youth is temporary. Don't say stop. Dance. Don't say stop. Sing. Don't stay stop. Don't say stop. Don't say stop. Fame doesn't last for long. After that nights will be Lonely. I don't care. I have a bus. Life is short. The trip shouldn't end. Control it. Don't say stop. Dance. Don't say stop. Sing. Don't stay stop. Dance. Don't say stop. Sing. Don't stay stop. Life is short. The trip shouldn't end. Control it. Don't stay stop. There will be dollars and pounds in my pocket. My feet won't stay on the ground. There will be only fun. I will hear the sound of coins. Life is short. The trip shouldn't end. Control it. Don't stay stop. Run ! Fire! Fire! I hurt my face. It's emitting so much smoke. And you want a fitness certificate. First repair this. My passport. It chewed my passport! I'll beat the living day light out of you What happened? If you say things like that to me, I won't spare you ! It's either you or me. Why me? You won't survive. Why you? You are my friend. I won't spare him ! Where are you taking the gear lever? How do you expect mew to drive? Hey, brother. What's in my loin cloth? Sundar. ( Handsome ) Where are you? Hey, move ahead. Sundar! Why have you blocked traffic? We need you to move the bus! Hello, Sir. Happy Valentine's Day. Happy Valentine's Day. Move your bus! I hope your wife and all your girlfriends are fine? Look at my grey hair, ask about my children. Move your bus your causing a jam. How do I move it? It's in neutral. Put it in the first gear and get out. But. . . You see, Sir. The mouse nibbled my friend's passport. So why should the public suffer? Move your bus. What can I do about it? He's going to have him killed. Who? The mouse? No, my friend. Why are talking about your friend. Move your bus. I can move when he gets back. He ran away with the gear lever. Sundar Don't call me that! Sundar Don't flatter me by calling me handsome. The whole world knows that I am. Who says that? My mother says it. Whatever, it's too hot. You'll get a tan. Have a seat. I'll go call Sundar. Where did it go? Leave me alone. Are you mad? Yes. I won't be at peace until I kill that mouse. He's shattered my dreams. There is a traffic jam. The inspector is very angry. Give me the gear lever. I want to crush the liver of that mouse. The inspector will crush my liver. Leave it. How long will you run? Move! Move! Who is this? This is Sundar! You call this ape handsome. Get in the bus. Come on. Where are you going? I said file. What have you brought? These are applications from drivers and conductors. Don't you think these are a lot of applicants for just two posts? It's proportionate to the population of our country. Proportion. Exactly. It's difficult to select just two. It's simple, it's easy. We will give work to the one who gives us Rs. 10,000. No money. No work. If employees have to pay bribe their employers. . . They won't work hard. A company runs efficiently on hard work and sincerity. You're way ahead of yourself. Stop, stop. It's not a bribe. It's a deposit. That is a wrong thing to do. Is that so? Poor people are being exploited. Their mills are demolished and pubs are built. Shops on the street are being demolished. . . . . .and hoardings are put up. Huts are demolished to clear land for tall buildings. After all they sacrifice, who knows. . . . . .if they receive worthy compensation. So why should I charge them? Because you have committed a big mistake. . . . . .by being born here. We all do it. It's how we conduct business traditionally. Traditionally? That's what I said. I want to expand my business. Your brother-in-law has come. He will expand the business. Grand launch I see. Good. Very good. I'd like to offer advice however you may find it useless. No, that isn't true. Go ahead. Listen to me. Look, you don't have any experience in this business. So I have two experienced candidates a. . . . . .driver and a conductor. Appoint the both of them. What happened to him? He just lost Rs.20,000. Who are these people? He has 20 years experience, driving on desert roads He's even worked in the army. He's got sharp eyes and strong arms. Real smooth on the steering wheel. That's the driver. Basantilal. Honest. Great with accounts. Punctual and trustworthy. Is he a man or an advertisement? His father is a peon in the school. Your father taught him math. He has a nice name. Harilal. Good and to look after the office work. . . I am still alive. Don't take away my livelihood. Please. Okay. It means he is the manager. All the best. All the best. Keep moving. Keep moving. Ticket. Where to? Ratnakar Chowk. Keep moving. Keep moving. Follow that bus. Don't overtake the bus. It's running so smoothly. Hello, priest. Hello. We're finished. Come on. Hurry up. Come, come. Children will travel to and from school in comfort. This man will also travel comfortably. The priest too will perform his duties comfortably. Our bus will make the lives of many a lot easier. Exactly. Dad was right. I love this job. You're happy, aren't you? I'm happy. Yes. The bus is here. You people sit in the cab. I can't afford to share a cab. No. I will take you to the bus in this cab. I am the owner of the bus. Come on. Sit. Ticket. Ticket. Where are you going? To the in-law's house. Yours or hers? Mine. We were married recently. So you will use this route often. Two children, then four then six. Whatever. Overtake the bus? What can I say to James Bond? Why didn't you stop the bus? He. . . Do you want to disgrace me in this village? A passenger needed the bus and you whizzed by him. Come. Come. Please, come. Come. Give it to me, I'll take it. Okay, sir. Such a long queue for tickets. Great! Great! Go on. Form a queue. Wow! For its first day the bus is already in top gear. Go on. Your name? There wasn't a single bus to Ratnakar Chowk. It's been a great help to people of our locality. Thank you. Your full name. Payal. From Sonawadi to Ratnakar Chowk. Money. Show me your ID card. So many formalities for one ticket. I am not issuing a ticket. I am offering her a concession. Show me your ID card. Concession? You think you are the government of India? Don't compete with our leaders. They lead a luxurious life. We have to make ends meet. Leadership is of no use to us. We just conduct business. That's what I'm doing. Every big business offers concessions. Yes. We have to offer concession. . . . . .to people who make our country proud. Students, senior citizens, military officers, navy officers. In a year we will earn a hundred million from the bus. That's what you said. I was insane. You. Yes, me. Concession will ruin our business. Stop this right now. Leave. There are many people in the queue. They will trash us. Have you brought your ID card? No. I'm an apprentice in a printing press. Look, madam. My boss is very kind hearted. Don't take advantage of him. You're not a student. You don't qualify for a concession. Quickly out with the money. Please. Please. But I am learning printing work. We learn something or the other through out our lives I'm learning English. He is learning this business. Business. Yes. He is learning this business. Prices of diesel and LP are skyrocketing. We may incur heavy loses if even one screw goes lose. I can see that. What are you looking at? Sundar! She doesn't understand. Shut up! I didn't tell you. I spoke to him. His name is Sundar. So why did you look at me? First I looked at him and then I looked at you. Before that I was talking to you. You dare yell at me. Great you've opened my eyes. Now I won't look at you. Now leave. No student. No concession. Leave! Leave! Leave! Don't shout. Your boss started a new scheme. That's why I came. I didn't come here to beg. People who become rich overnight become proud. What childishness is this? They're hard working. Come on. Come. Get me some tea. I will get my money then pay your fare. Wait for two minutes. Basantilal. Yes. How much did you earn today? The bus was crowded. . . . . .but with old men, children, military officers. All got a concession. So, not much. Give me whatever you earned. It's all that I earned. Give it to me. The bus is still running, right? I'll just pay the cab's fare. Listen ! Listen ! Hang on ! Let's decide something today. Do you think of me as your wife? You follow the bus everyday in a cab No. Make yourself clear. Do you think I may break or sell the bus in your absence? Like yours, it's our livelihood as well. No, you're mistaken. You see, today was the first day. So I was just admiring the bus. I won't do this tomorrow onwards. That's better. Tomorrow onwards I'll sit in the bus. Yes. You see, if there is a direct contact between the owner. . . . . .and the passengers then its good for business. Yes. That's it. It's a tactic. You pronounced it incorrectly. What? Tactic. Tactic. Listen, just drive the bus. This is not the way to talk to your boss. He will go to America speaking the way he does. Was he speaking ill of me? No. We were talking about other things. What's going on? Get away from my sight! Go away! Get away from my sight! He's fallen ! A bus, on my street? The bus moved just a bit and you fell. If it had moved any faster, you could have had a bad fall. Get away from my sight. Really? Fine. Now we won't mess with you. Here. Fine. Do you think I'm a fool? They ran away! This is a street for decent people. It's our street. Got it? Without our permission. . . What problem does he have with us? What's his problem? Good morning ! Good morning ! Our commuters should not be inconvenienced. Sir, everyone here has received a concession. How can anyone complain? Everyone's happy. Look at them. I didn't say that everyone should get a concession. You didn't understand. Ticket. . . ticket. Go start from there. Go there. My friends, this decent man that stands before you. . . . . .owns this bus. He's a fine man, so please get up and respect him. Let him sit. Please, get up. Get up. Be seated. Be seated. Be seated. Be seated. No one's listening to you. It's falling on deaf ears. How do you feel? I'm comfortable. These are new seats. Is everything all right? Can you feel the breeze? Yes, of course. Our pleasure lies in your satisfaction. Our objective is to insure. . . . . .that you have a smooth journey. Like butter melting in your mouth. Drive properly! What's wrong, Mr. Basantilal? There's a fly in the butter. What happened? Hang on. . . Why didn't get new tyres installed. The tyres are new. What can I do if the roads are old? Tell your boss to stop being such a brag. . . . . .or people will knock his fake teeth out. We permit people to take such liberties. Who can avoid punctures? Hey, we want a refund. It will take five minutes to change the tyres. . . five minutes. We are paying you to take care of business. It will be done. You got a concession. You shouldn't complain. Let's get him. What? Don't let these people get away. Great driver, what do you think you doing? Throw it down. Why? There's no air in it. Not even in that? No. A bullock cart is better than this. Look, the customer is always right. But today it's not entirely our fault. Give us some time. We'll get a new tire. You got the tyres punctured. It's just a tire. Let's get a new one. This driver and conductor will be beaten up. It's my turn. Dear, your papa won't be able. . . . . .to drop you to school tomorrow. If papa is a little busy. . . Can we be a little lazy? A day off from school. No holiday. Tomorrow your uncle will drop his. . . . . .niece and nephew to school himself. Yes. Don't mind, Uncle. . . . . .but everyone teases us because of your two-bit bus. It's quite another thing. . . . . .that we'll become because of it, but. . . We'll never travel in your bus. What's your daughter saying? Deepak! Deepak! Now what is he yelling for? Listen, listen. What's the matter? I told you. . . I told you? What about the bus? Basantilal, is out of control. Nothing is all right. He doesn't stop on conductor's whistle. . . . . .nor does he obey the conductor. He pretends to be looking straight ahead. . . . . .but he's actually gazing into the sky. Our business is in the dumps. Bus is in the garage. But what's wrong? What's the bottom line. The bus banged into a shop. We're doomed. We were fortunate that the shopkeeper went to pee. Otherwise, the shopkeeper would've been dead and. . . . . .our business would've been ruined with it. Why didn't you say that no one died. Already the dog is howling outside. . . It's not a dog's howl. A human is howling like a dog. Wait for a minute. Come. He's the boss. Talk to him. Cry as you want. Just make sure you do it in front of him. Come. Don't cry like this. I live here. Take it easy. What's wrong? What's wrong? Your driver is responsible for this. Calm down. He has ruined me. Seven years of planning has gone down in tubes. My ponytail ! My ponytail ! What's wrong with your ponytail? Your ponytail was chopped off. Shut up! I mean, my small kids. Who will feed them? Your confused. Have you lost your shop or your wife? Listen to me. I'll compensate you for your losses. You'll pay me money now? How can I repay you at this very moment? I'll repay your money later. Later. How can I trust you? How can you not trust us? I own the bus. I own the bus. Come on. Okay. Trust us. Hey, you tell him. Come on. Why are you doing like this? What happened? Do you really own the bus? It might not look like we do, but do own the bus. Explain it to him. Calm down. What's going on? Is this a house or a court? Even at night disputes are ongoing. They are always at it. They go on and on. You pay the guy. I'll look for Basantilal. You're resting in peace here. You drive smoothly on hilly terrain. Do flies sit on your glasses. . . . . .while driving on a straight road? Sir, small accidents occur now and then. Shut up. Small accidents occur now and then? You can't see through these huge glasses you've got on. Remove them. What is this? What? Look, asking me to tell him. Wear your glasses. He's asking me what it is! What's this?! It's an eye. I'm not talking about this. What is this? It's a finger which appears as the alphabet 'I.' What is this? It's two fingers that could be read as a 'V.' I know all the alphabets in English. You're familiar with the alphabets, right? Do you know what this is? I'll give you one hard blow. You've cost me Rs.35,000. Don't beg now. Next time. . . Start deducting it from this month's salary. You shut your mouth. And you listen to me. My income is scarce. . . . . .and expenditure are climbing. If you ever. . . If you ever? Are you crazy? Giving a senseless person advise. . . . . .is the same as giving medication to the dead. Fire him. We'll give pay a heavier deposit and hire a new driver. Don't play with emotions. I can't do that. My Brother-in-law has hired him. My sister will be annoyed. Why are you happy? If you ever. . . What if you ever? At least charge him for the mishap? If you interrupt me ever again. . . . . .it will be not tolerated. If you try to create a nuisance. . . . . .or play any games. . . . . .remember I'll kill you all. Do you understand? Wear this. There were two there. Two drivers. . . . . .who didn't wake up from their sleep. Remember that. Hello. Don't con me with your manners I've wised up to the ways of the world. Did you hear that, morons? It was directed at the both of you. Deepak will sell the bus and get you to work as a butcher. And I'll gift you the knife. Get lost. Are you here for a concession? It's not available here any more. Are new to the bus trade? No, it's an old bus. Why? Are you the new owner. So? You're not familiar with Gajender Singh. Who is Gajender Singh? The secretary of ABMU. What's this ABMU? Akhil Bhartiya Mazdur Union. So? We're Mr. Singh's men. So, what can I do? Did you threaten one of our drivers saying that you'll kill him? Not one, I've threatened two of them. I guess Mr. Singh needs to meet you in person. Yes, tell him to do so. Who's Mr. Singh? Gajender? Go tell him. What nonsense is this? Tell me, brother. Is this some kind of market? Everyone seems to have an attitude. Give me two kilos of this, four kilos of radish. What is this nuisance? Have some shame. You're business is in shambles. You have no money. You're broke. You've ruined the family's reputation. You've ruined the peace. You've hindered our happiness and contentment. You're talking nonsense. Your face is glowing. You're living in luxury in this huge bungalow. What's broken? Everything is broken? Nothing's broken. You should've not spoken rudely with people from the union. Don't tussle with the big fish if you're living in water. They'll create a nuisance on bus route. You've to learn behaving polite to people. Curb your wrath. Control yourself. If you feel like using fowl language. . . . . .make sure you sugar coat it. Respect people. They appreciate it. What do we lose? Gajender! May he live long ! 'You should learn to love people.' Hello, sir. So you are Gajender? You threatened driver Basantilal ! No. I just said it in anger. But I apologize for losing my temper. I have not finished yet. What did you tell him? He can't see. His eyesight is weak. You humiliated him by constantly. . . . . .removing his specs while talking to him. Look. . . Yes. A moving vehicle can meet with an accident. . . . . .anytime, anywhere, anyhow with anybody. Got it? But who gave you the permission to insult a poor worker? I am really sorry. Look. . . If my apology is not enough then. . . . . .I am ready to fall at the driver's feet to calm him down. I bow down in front of your great personality. Look, I have not come here to threaten you. I have come just to explain it to you. Workers are no longer helpless. The era of exploitation of workers by employers is gone. If you don't believe me and if you want to see it for yourself. . . . . .then repeat your behavior. But bear one thing in mind. Employers always begin this game. But workers will always triumph in the end. Got it? Yes. You and your colleagues are great. I am an ignorant man. You have broadened my knowledge. Gajender! May he live long ! Take care of these workers. Where has he gone? How are you, Mr. Basantilal? Any extraordinary news in the newspaper? Will you have breakfast? Shall I get something for you? Russian sandwich, uttapa ( rice pancake ). This is your bus. Have an outing with your wife and children. It will be costly. No, I won't take the fare from you. Look, my wife is no longer mine. She divorced me and married somebody else. If I took my ex-wife for an outing in this bus. . . . . .then her current husband would bash me up. You gallivant with your family. It's your bus. I have nobody in this world besides my parents, sir. So? Your bus is good. But I can't take the risk of becoming an orphan, sir. Will you have breakfast? Shall I get something for you? Shall I order something for you? No need for that, sir. In fact, I will give you an offering. You are my God. No, I am not interested in becoming God. We are workers. Come. Let all the workers unite. Who says so? Marx. Who is Marx? You're a worker and you don't know who Marx is? No, I have heard about marks. You get it in school during exams. You are an ardent newspaper reader. But you are so ignorant. Start the bus. Come on. Start the bus. Yes sir. Why did you take the trouble? You should have sent it through somebody. It's no trouble. I was passing by. I thought I'd get to meet you too. It's good that you were passing by. Its original scotch. Will you have it with soda or cold drink? No, plain. Plain? Neat. Neat. Direct. I ce. I ce. I ce, baby. Yes. I'll just get it. Look, Uttam. The property prices in this area are declining rapidly. Yes. But I am still ready to pay you. . . . . .the same price which I promised you. That's great. It will be done. Don't worry. You guys decide quickly. What does one think about? It will be done soon. Right? It will be done in a few days. Say yes. It will be done. It will be done. Yes. Good. Brother-in-law. Sir, is he your brother-in-law? Yes, call Basantilal. I will solve your people's commuting problem. Hi, brother-in-law. Hello. Is my face a red traffic signal that you stopped upon seeing me? Quickly show me your RC, CL, DL. I showed it to you last night. What was the time? The bus left the stand at 8 o'clock. Did you forget? You quarreled with the laundryman. You were roaming in the house in your underwear. Shut up! Shut up! Don't interfere. It will break our link. Okay. I am a vehicle inspector when on duty. I am nobody's brother-in-law. Follow me! Follow me! What happened to him? How many passengers are there? Fifty. Seems to be more. Fifty are seated. Ten are standing. There are 12 children too. It means the bus is overloaded. Excuse me. We have left behind double the number of people at the bus stop. As only one bus runs on this route. . . . . .people jump inside a moving bus. So what can we do? Did you send the timetable of this bus to the RTO? Time. . . Where is the permit too? Too? Yes. Why are you asking about his wife? Shut up! This tire seems to be old. No. It's new. Resold. There are no patches. Look, it's shining. Look. See. Is there a first aid box? There is a box and medicine too. Show it to me. Come, sir. Sir. Yes. Keep him quiet by showing him the green paper. What are you saying? Bribe him with money. I should bribe my brother-in-law? He said that he is your brother-in-law only at home. Didn't he say it? When did he say that? You are provoking me. I am not provoking you. He is provoked. Calm him down. Go. Calm him down. Move. Open it. What? Open the first aid box. Scoundrel. It's a mouse. The tire is not suitable. Rule 9( B ) has been broken. Listen ! The bus is overloaded. Rule 65( D ) has been broken. Listen ! There is a mouse in the first aid box. There is a mouse in the first aid box. I don't know the rule number. I will have to look it up. But this rule is broken. Yes. Brother-in-law. Brother-in-law. National Permit Part B is not shown. Rule 238 has been broken. Listen. Timetable. . . What? Extra income. Your hand will be broken. My honour has been tarnished. No. My honour has been tarnished. Extra income. Shut up! Glass has been broken. Take this bus to the RTO office right away. This bus' fitness certificate has been cancelled. This bus will remain in the RTO office as long as I want. Can you see brother-in-law anywhere? Move aside. Deepak, I am very sorry. Apologize. Exactly. If the government officer's windshield had not broken. . . . . .then we wouldn't have been in trouble. Your brother-in-law might put me behind bars. Don't worry. Don't worry. I'm here. What should I do? Who is he? Seems to be a police officer. I think he is a police officer. He. . . Twenty. Twelve. Twenty. Twelve. Okay, sir. Let's settle at 18. Sir, I have to give the delivery in Rajasthan. I have to deliver coconuts. Please release my truck. Give me 19 and leave. Okay, sir. Sir, mine. . . What? What about me, sir? The rule is broken. First, I will receive money at home. Then I will give you a token. Okay. It will be done. It's a minor thing. Get new tyres. Buy medicines. And give it for repairing. We will release your bus. Thank you very much, sir. Deepak, your father was my teacher. Consider this an honorarium. How is sir? Fine. Give him my best regards. Surely. Sir. Great! Uttam, you are great! There was a minor problem with the bus. Nevertheless, you brought your brother-in-law's bus here. Thank you, sir. You are an honest man. You don't indulge in favoritism. No need to assert that. Even I know that. I have signed. You too sign, and release his bus. Okay. You have to take care of your brother-in-law. The wife's brother is given preference over the world. But sir, he broke the jeep's windshield. The glass is absolutely broken, sir. He will have to pay the penalty, sir. Which jeep? The one in which I travel, sir. But that's in the garage. You said the jeep will be ready day after tomorrow. You even sent a bill of Rs. 10,000. Sir, actually. . . Sir, the bus's ticket. You will get that in the bus. No. I had given it for printing. What's the name of the company? Hang on. What's the name of the company? Bhandarkar. . . Bandarkar Printing Press. Not my company. The name of your company. Chal Chala Chal Company. Payal, check whether his order is ready. You ! You? How much? Rs. 1000. What are you saying? The order was for Rs.5000. Concession here too. The ticket was worth Rs.5000. The bill is Rs. 1000. Understood? If you argue with me, then I'll teach you a lesson. Get lost! She didn't get the pass, so she will slay me. Hello. Harilal. Did you give her the ticket? I don't remember. Did she take the ticket from you? Possibly not. Are you a conductor or what? You don't remember anything. Ticket please. Why are you only checking my ticket? It's my wish. Show me your ticket. The whole procession. So where is your entire family sitting? Show me. Who told you that I've brought my entire family along? So many tickets? It's all mine. Yesterday's, day before yesterday's. Did you buy them for the entire week? It's of the previous week. Check which one is today's. Quickly check my ticket too. I have to get down. Do you get your ticket checked everyday? Leave. Do you have any more tickets? Yes. At home. Do you want to buy it for half the price? Do you sell our bus' ticket for half the price? What do you mean? Why do you have so many tickets? You only issued it to me, right? Sundar. . . Shut up! From where did you get the ticket? Sundar, listen. . . She works in a printing press. It's allowed in India. Our bus' tickets too are printed at the same press. That too is allowed. The rest is crystal clear. What? She is a cunning girl who is duping us. What? She gets the ticket directly from the printing press. We gave an order of 500. Yes. She made 500 for herself. Everyday she uses one and she fools us. What nonsense! You are accusing me of theft! I can never stoop so low! Basanti ! Stop the bus! From tomorrow onwards I won't travel. . . . . .in this dirty, ramshackle bus! You are not worthy of this bus too. Buy a plane. Travel in a plane. Okay? Go. I have some work. We don't do other people's work. You can leave. You don't appreciate humor? What? Tell me. What do you want? I want to do business in your bus. Of life insurance, sir. For my business, no location is better than public transport. When you sit in a bus, you are not sure. . . . . .whether you will survive the trip or not. In that dangerous situation, if I inform the passengers. . . . . .about the Bima Suraksha scheme. . . . . .then any foolish person will buy this policy. Thanks for indirectly calling me a fool. What? But the condition of my bus is not so bad. Secondly, the dangerous situation which you are waiting for. . . . . .will never affect my bus. So you may leave. Sir, I will give you commission. If anything happens to the policy holder in your bus. . . . . .then I will give you double the commission. I pray that nothing harmful will happen to my bus. And you pray that something should happen. So nothing can happen. Hello. Sir, as usual, somebody has taken off with your bus. And the public is going berserk. From where are you calling? From a PCO. Where is Sundar? In the air. Listen to me! Hey, let go off me. This is wrong. Why are they handling him like some luggage? Why are you hitting him? Deepak! Move! Hang on ! Hang on ! What happened? What happened? They both ran away. Who? The driver and the conductor? Yes. And they bashed me up. Why? They completely thrashed me. Why? Have they gone crazy? Who are you? I am me. What are you saying? He is the owner of the bus. No! No! No! Please! Please! Don't beat me. Who will take the. . . . . .guarantee of everybody's safety. . . . . .if you all bash me up? Are you crazy? Now, what is left? A great deal is left. Where is she? Where is she? The girl has been admitted to a hospital. You are late. The girl has been admitted? In which hospital? Sardar Hospital. Sardar Hospital. I will give her security. Did you see that? I will give her security. Saw that? What? I was talking about this dangerous situation. If you wouldn't have interfered, all this wouldn't have happened. Give me the key. I have to give her security. I have to give her security. Move! Move! I have to give her security. I will give her security. Come on. You too were with them ! What have I done? I didn't do anything. Why are you beating me? Listen to me! Insurance agent! Have you got your insurance done? What was the need to buy all of this? You don't understand. If we flatter her, then her anger will subside. Where is the bus' insurance papers? I don't have it. Why? Did you pay the insurance? No. Why? We are finished. That girl holds all the power. She can save us. And she can ruin us too. Giving her all these things too won't suffice? She will demand more than this? Yes. How much will this fatso demand? At least Rs. 100,000 to 200,000. Shut up. Nothing like that will happen. Why is she admitted here? Where is the girl who was in the accident? Sister. Sister. Yes. Where is the patient who met with a bus accident? There she is. She is the one. She is the one. Her leg is fractured. We will have to scan it. We might even have to perform an operation. Oh, my God. Are you her husband? No. Her neighbor. At times, we take care of her. We've come today to look after her. Okay. I won't! You leave. Leave. Okay. Is our luck so bad? We always face problems. Were we destined with this troublesome girl? I think the public is insane. The police will come here soon. Don't give me another worry. Tell me. What should we do? If the girl spoke the truth, we'd be in trouble. Make her say that it was her mistake, in front of the police. She fainted while crossing the road. She suffers from sleepwalking. Forget about that. Tell me. What should I do? My life is in danger. People bashed me up there. Now they won't spare me here. Excuse me. I will run away from here. All the best to you. Take care. Heartiest congratulations! Am I getting married? Do whatever you want. I'm leaving. Do whatever you want. Is she a girl or what? Good evening. Aren't you ashamed to say good evening? I have lost my leg. My life is ruined. Why are you troubling me? You and your friend. I asked for a concession and he insulted me. He accused me of theft. I took an oath that I'd never travel in your bus. And you told your driver to collide with me. That's a lie. You are making me out to be a villain. It was an accident. Otherwise why would I have brought you so much to eat? If I had planned your accident then. . . . . .why did I splurge so much money? No, no, no! After the fight that day, I can't trust you at all. That's why I've called an attorney. I'll file a case against you. Look, taking matters to the court. . . . . .has never been beneficial to anyone. It's my personal experience. I will surely demand compensation. I have lost my leg. The leg is a part of your body as well. This is not a joke. After deducting all the bank holidays. . . . . .how many days are left in a year? If those days are spent going to court. . . . . .then you will grow old soon. Besides that, no justice will be given to you. Justice is justice. Its not instant noodles that will be ready in two minutes. Yes. That's what I'm saying. It's not instant noodles. It's a long process. Let's settle the matter between ourselves. Please leave. My attorney, Vinayak Agarwal, told me not to talk to anybody. What? What? Brother-in-law Vinayak Agarwal. What? Yes. He is my brother-in-law. Oh ! You plan the accident. Your kin fights my case. Your family will get me treated. What will I do? I am stuck. That's not true. I and my brother-in-law don't see eye to eye. We can't stand each other. We are always quarrelling. That's why I suggested we settle the matter among ourselves. Why do you want to go to court? I am with you. I will give you justice. What will you do? Will you take on the responsibility of my family? From today onwards your family is my family. Go ahead. From today onwards you have three legs. Go ahead. Three? One is yours and two mine. Go ahead. I just hope your husband doesn't feel bad. No. Father, younger sister and elder sister's daughter. That's all. It's a small family. I will look after them. Don't worry. Shall I consider it finalized? Will you. . . Police! Look, tell the inspector that you fainted in front of the bus. The bus is not responsible for your accident. I will handle the matter. Don't worry. You just. . . I will bear everybody's expenses. Listen. Yes. Please get tea for me. Please. I'll just get it. Blackmailer. I'm stressed out. I bought second hand tire. It got punctured. Then I bought a firsthand tire. I had to pay Rs.35,000 to the shopkeeper. After that, the accident. If the accident had to take place. . . . . .then it should've been one of your brothers-in-law. We should have introduced both of them to Basantilal. Don't talk too much. Otherwise I will show your face to Basantilal. Both of them are my brothers-in-law. Why are you after them? You are talking on and on. Whenever I see someone, I feel like I owe that person something. Now that I'm looking at you it's as though I owe you. But you really owe me. I'm just kidding. Oh, really? Sir, the preparations for the fair have begun. What should I do? Dance like a girl? No, sir. I forgot to tell you. The people from the fair were asking for charity. Everybody wants a piece of the pie. No, sir. Everybody makes money at the fair. The omniscient Lord Ganpati is renowned. Many people will come to seek the Lord's blessings. All you need is a special permit. Another permit? The bus is crowded day and night. No one's going to bother you if you have a special permit. You don't have to worry about the schedule. We'll run the bus smoothly and make loads of money. Yes. Harilal, you're making sense for the first time. You deserve a reward. There's no need, sir. Moron, driving such a heavy bus is not a cakewalk. I don't change gears till I don't get paid. Basantilal, let me start making some money. . . . . .and then you'll see what I do. Pay me back first. What did he say? What did he say? I didn't hear a thing. Then it's okay. Yes. I earned a good amount of money after a while. What nonsense is this? Nothing. I was trying to adjust my drape. What are you doing here? I trusted you, but you didn't pay me back. Lord Ganpati's fair was going on over here. I didn't get to rest even for a minute. After being discharged from the hospital. . . . . .I don't even enough to afford an air-conditioned taxi. You were supposed to take care of my expenses. What's going on here? Did you hear that? Yes. Stand quietly over here and listen to me. Don't you worry. I'll handle it if something goes wrong. Deepak, who's this girl? He betrayed me. He ruined my life. Mother Goddess, I can't hear anything further. What's wrong? I can understand your plight. I didn't expect this moron to be so inhumane. But what have I done? You. . . What have you done? You forgot when I was in the hospital. Hospital? Yes, and he said he'd look after my entire family. Did you not promise me? Yes, I said that I'd look after your family. So, what? So, when are you going to do that? After they're dead? Why can't you be less fatalistic, Sister? I'm already dealing with this fraud. Shut up. Don't say a word. Come over here. Why don't you understand? I've understood everything. If you would've got married at the right time. . . . . .it couldn't come to this. You could've had many girls from reputed families. . . . . .but you chose with this good for nothing. You're mistaken. She comes from a decent family. There are no problems. Listen to me. Don't you dare to talk rubbish about my family. No, no. Why would we badmouth your family? How can we blame those poor people? He should take all the blame. What nonsense?! Why do you go on about blaming me? Why don't you understand? You think I am a na Girl. Hospital. You didn't tell us. What will your father think when he finds out? You kept us in the dark. And Deepak, your name means light. And me too. Shut up. I won't keep quiet any longer. You can't expect me to keep quiet when a. . . . . .girl's life is being ruined. Shut up. Shut up. Get inside. My bus met with an accident. She was one of the victims. Being injured, she was hospitalized. . . . . .and I'm paying for it. This is what it is all about. That's it. Is that true? Yes. I was really scared. You were scaring the hell out of me. Go inside. And listen to me. Take this. Take Rs.500 and leave. Just Rs.500? My daily expenditure for the medicine. . . . . .and the injection is Rs. 1000. Here's another 500. Go away. How much money are you going to spend on this girl? She's not a girl. What rubbish are you saying? I mean, she's a patient. Why do you interfere all the time? Go inside. Listen to me. I'm doing well with my bus business. I'm running special trips. I'm going to be paid soon. I'll give it to you as soon as I receive it. Really? I promise you. I promise I'll pay you. Now what are you promising her? Are you going to go or should I. . . Father! Listen to me. . . Basanti, start this vehicle now. We've been waiting for the last 45 minutes. Let that two-bit conductor arrive. . . . . .only then can I go. And look, if you're in a hurry, you can walk. Hail Goddess Lakshmi. Priest, did you see Harilal? We all are God's children. You. . . He wears a mark on his forehead. He wears a thread around his wrists and an amulet on his neck. Simpleton. Always pleads. The conductor. Hail Lord Ram. Hail Lord Ram. Don't talk about that moron. He must be lying intoxicated somewhere. Brother, was Harilal here? He used to visit frequently, but I haven't seen him around. He said he's got a new job. Where should I search for him now? By the way, he's got someone special. A woman. Where's Harilal? They got into a cab and took off early morning. Some spare parts. . . Deepak! Deepak! Let's see. Did you find out? Was there an account to settle? No. Oh, yes! He came to collect his last month's salary. That's it really. Deepak, I'm talking about the collection. The money we made at the fair. The ticket money? The money we've made in the last ten days? He was going to give me all the money today. Why? Harilal ! He's not here. Where is he? Tell him to step outside. He was here this morning, but he's not home right now. Listen, don't hide him. We'll find him, no matter where he is. You, shut up! Has he done anything wrong? What? No way! We made a mistake by employing him. . . . . .without checking his background. . . . . .or asking for any kind of deposit. Being a laborer. . . . . .we understand the hardships they face. His apparent sense of morality lured us to employ him. . . . . .we were conned in return. We patiently waited for money. . . . . .in order to pay off our debts. . . . . .but that worthless Harilal ran away with our money. Tell him it doesn't matter where he hides. God will always have an eye on him. He has disgraced us. Is this what we deserve? Sell your scraps! Hey, Deepak. Where are you going? That's what I've been wondering as well. Let's go to the police station, let's file an F.I.R. What's fir? I mean, FIR. You better dump that English dictionary. . . . . .you have in your hollow head. But we need to file a complaint, don't we? That's what I'm thinking about. Did you see his aged parents? Look at the conditions they live in. We lost our money, they lost their son. What good will come out of filing a complaint? The parents will suffer eventually. The son has enough money to spend. . . spend lavishly. I can't punish his parents for his deeds. They're already looking down a gun's barrel. I don't want to be the one to pull the trigger. You have a big heart. However compassion is an alien language to most people. Those tire vendors and garage owners. . . . . .will dig their fangs to get what's theirs. Then what will you do? There are two men who live with their in-laws. Knock on either of their doors. We have nothing more to loose. That's exactly what they want. As soon as I open my mouth. . . . . .they will start shouting, Sell the house! My real trouble is I can't begin to. . . . . .ask my own family for help. I don't have a bag full of money. I'm not asking you for one either. I want you to know. . . . . .I'm just saying. . . . . .that I took the money from you because I was sure. . . . . .that I could return it. It's just bad luck that I can't. Walk with me! Okay, listen. You're like a brother to me. Forget about what you owe me. Going to America is like climbing Mount Everest. Get the money, apply for a Visa. . . . . .then bang your head to learn English. It's like building castles in the air. Does my situation look any different to you? We're thriving on a dream of ruins. Just wait till we get our hands on that conductor. I'll repay it as soon as I can. It would've been far better. . . . . .if there were a shop where they sold conductors. It would've been far better. . . . . .if there were a shop where they sold conductors. Outside. Let's talk outside. Goodbye. This wouldn't be the case if it were anyone else. Yes, why not? Your brother's a great personality. Conductor. Soon he'll be promoted to cleaner. He'll be clearing the filth off the bus. . . . . .and then hurling it all over our faces. Why are you talking like that? There's nothing wrong with what I'm saying. Knock some sense into him. Save him from himself. Or else he'll ruin the image of our family in this society. Don't waste your time. No job is too lowly. If you have what it takes, then your heart will be content. Keep going, keep going. Always keep moving ahead. Forget whatever's happened. You should move ahead, son. Father, I may not come home everyday. On some days, I might have to stay back to guard the bus. Thank you. Don't mention it. I'll get going. Ladies and gentlemen. The Chal Chala Chal company has been cheated. What you should all remember. . . . . .is that, I, the owner of this bus, am working as a conductor. The story behind why and how is very long. . . . . .so I'll narrate it some other time. For now, please bear with me. Please inform me about your stops and fares. Calculate the fares by yourself and pay me what's. . . . . .appropriate as I do not have my calculator. Don't try to swindle me, because I'm good with money. Yes, sir. Where do you want to go? P.C. What is P.C.? Police Constable. What does that mean? It means we travel free. Okay. Where do you want to go? P.C. Hey, how many P.C. s do we have? How many more P.C. s? There're seven police constables in this bus. We're all on way to our D.C.P.'s daughter's wedding. Give them my heartiest complements. Yes. What about you? Mahalaxmi. I'm not asking your name. I want the name of your stop. That's the name of the bus stop. Please read it. What have you done? We've done a lot for the laborers. . . that's our duty. What issue are you here for? By the grace of the devil, we have only issues between us. . . . . .and time. It's the police complaint. You were duped by your own man. So why did you file your complaint against me? I'm the one who should be complaining. After all, I'm the one who lost money. What're you up to? What's the logic behind this? What are your principals behind this stunt? But don't forget. I'm not going to spare anyone for this. But right now it's not in your interest to open your mouth. The police complaint is against you. You've caused considerable mental stress to a laborer. . . . . .by falsely accusing him and firing him. It's not a small issue. Hey, hey! It's all lies. But this is what the police complaint says. That's why you're the first one to be suspected of foul play. Do you think scribbling anything on a piece of paper. . . . . .will make it gospel truth? But its validity is affirmed. . . . . .when you register it in front of a police officer. That's the law. Understood? Sure, you could've complained before I did. But you lost that opportunity. So now. . . watch your every step. . . . . .and every word that comes out of your mouth. From this moment on. . . . . .you're the one who needs to watch out, Mr. Singh. Law is not a child's race. . . . . .where the winner is rewarded with some sort of trophy. And you better stop playing these twisted tricks. . . . . .under the pretext of the law. Because the truth gets by the most deceitful barriers. Sorry. Sorry. Sorry, my brakes have failed. Shut up! Do you think you're flying a rocket? You could've killed me. Why didn't I? What? Why didn't the brakes work on time? But why were you standing like the Statue of Libertine. . . . . .in the middle of the road? It's Statue of Liberty! Yes, yes, it's the same thing. But I'm the one who has to go to America, not you. Will you be going to America in a bus? I'll go on a cycle. What's the trouble? Why would you stand in the middle of the road? Hey, this is my job. The other day, during the carnival, I stood at the roadside. . . . . .and I signaled you to stop the bus. We never pay attention to roadside signaling. We're civilized people. What? Hey! Why didn't you stop the bus? I didn't stop the bus. . . . . .because my boss didn't want me to. Tell me something. There were many passengers. . . . . .who were stranded in the heat. How could we leave them stranded. . . . . .and serve you? That means the bus was overloaded. Rule No. 1 13, Section K, broken. When your bus was being refueled at the petrol pump. . . Is it a crime? Yes. It's a crime. It's a crime to have a bus full of passengers. Understood? Listen, brother. . . Rule No.93, Section P, broken. Please listen to me. Hey! Oh, I forgot that you're never my brother-in-law. . . . . .when you're on duty. So whoever you are at this time. . . . . .stop with your deliberate nitpicking. We changed all the tyres of our bus, because you asked us to. We also carry insecticide in the first aid box. We've improved our timetable, let alone the bus. We don't waste money on petty issues. Spare this two in one from your pointless pestering. Do you understand the meaning of two in one? Owner and conductor. Oh, really? Conductor without a badge. Conductor without uniform. Section 90 broken. These darn sections. . . Section 90 broken ! This guy seriously needs to be thrashed to hell. He thinks we are a bunch of idiots. I really need to break his bones. . . Are you out of your mind? He's my brother-in-law. Let's go. Where's the wiper? Your viper's here. Do you know what wiper means? Yes. A dangerous and poisonous snake. Driver. . . wiper? They're there, sir. They're all there. Is it a moonwalker or is it lame? Why do you care about its dance moves? It's not even the monsoons. Then why are you so hung over this wiper thing? Tell me. We have two wipers. One of them is rusted and the other's crooked. What's your problem with the wiper? I understood. Rule No.65, Section O, broken. I want the wipers right now. Why? Are you that hungry? Shut up! I will charge you. Hey Basantilal, go get the wipers. . . . . .and attach it to his spectacle frames. So that he can see everything crystal clear. Listen, you. You've insulted me personally. That's impossible. You're never personal during your professional hour. Then how can you be insulted personally? I'll fine you ! Fine. Fine us or lock us up. Do you want us to be on the streets? Because we are. . . not ready to take to the streets. You can play with all the sections you want to, okay? okay? Darn it. He's the same guy. The don't show your face again guy. So what? Can you trust him? It shouldn't be like you want him to sew a trouser. . . . . .but he stitches a pyjama instead. We have no one else to go to than this ape. His hands tremble. . . . . .therefore, he has very few customers. . . . . .and he'll stitch our uniforms quickly. Get it? Sure I do. Excuse me. Hello. Are you here to get your undergarments stitched? Undergarments? Only an undergarment can be stitched in half an hour. Half an hour? Great. All he can stitch is filthy comments. What? It's nothing. We want you to stitch a conductor's uniform. We'll pay for it you get the cloth and have it stitched as well. What about the measurements? I've brought sample clothes for that. Urgent? Yes. Within half an hour. You expect me to buy the material, cut it and stitch it. . . . . .within half an hour? Yes. Within half an hour? I can't do it. You better find someone else. Leave. What's with you and half an hour? It's obvious. My brother-in-law already insulted me today. Why would I want to be humiliated again? You fool, weren't you the one to put yourself up to the challenge? I agree he was talking rubbish. . . . . .but he was right about one thing, wasn't he? A conductor should wear a proper uniform. He yelled, didn't he? What makes you think that he'll catch us again today? One time per day. Really? Not again on the same day? I'm telling you. He's not coming back. I want this done by the end of the day. . . . . .and I'm giving you some advance too. Measurement? Yes, yes. I'm giving you the clothes for the measurements. Okay, okay. Here's your money. Yes, you can keep the money too. Keep moving, keep moving. I want to remove my clothes. What are you talking about? I want to remove the bundle of clothes. . . from the roof. I'm a washerwoman. Okay. Please don't beat and wash me up. Everyone for Ratnagar Chowk, arrive here. Hi. . . Where are you hurt, now? Nowhere. I did it just for the sake of it. I'm talking about the general Hi. Oh. Why did you come here? Where else would I go? I don't have the printing press job anymore. . . . . .and I want to say something to you. But before that, I want to say something to you. My conductor ran away with my 100,000. I was supposed to give half of it to your family. . . . . .and the other half was mine. But your luck runs fine, and mine doesn't run at all. My uncle's daughter is getting married next week. I should give her a coin at least. Yes, sure. I have some to give you. You don't have to worry. I mean, a gold coin. A gold coin? Then I have to think about my bread and butter too. I can't go anywhere because of these crutches. My friends advise me to open a garment showroom. All I have to do is sit on the cash register. . . . . .and others will be working for me. Why don't you open a petrol pump. . . . . .a beauty parlor and diamond jewellery store, while you're at it? There as well, all you got to do is sit by the cash register. I don't want to argue with you. You were supposed to look after my family, weren't you? I want to look after a lot of people's families. Yours, mine and many more. But God should at least look after my pockets. However, I did remove something from here. . . . . .where is it. . . I removed these. Keep it. Excuse me? What? Let's go. Everyone's waiting. Yes, yes. We're good to go. The bus is ready to go. We'll settle whatever's remaining, okay? But? Come on, let's go. The bus is ready to go. It's a very long journey. Only this much? Listen, madam. This bus is Deepak's livelihood. He's mortgaged it in order to pay off his debts. On the one hand you have the money. . . . . .and it'll be better if you keep humanity in the other. Otherwise, there won't be any difference. . . . . .between you and those beasts. Goodbye. Mr. Banwari. Is the conductors uniform ready? Oh brother. . . Is the conductors uniform ready? It's not here. So, did you stitch it? Is it stitched? No, my daughter took it. Tell me one thing. Leave me. Why would your daughter need to try on the conductors dress? She. . . she didn't listen to me. She never listens to anyone. She took it away. But I paid you in advance. So what? So I told you I'd come this evening. . . Darn it. I told you. . . that. . . I'd come this evening to take it. Yes. But she doesn't listen to me. Where does she live? Over there. Come with me. We'll talk to her. Let's go. This. . . health tonic is really something. I'm not a health tonic. Come. Why. . . can't you walk straight? It's very difficult for me to be straight. . . . . .An Indian should always walk straight. Okay. The thing is that I drink a lot. Yes. So then. . . then don't ever come to my shop. Hurry up! She lives here? Yes. So what? But she's walking? Yes, yes, She's walking, so what? So what? Come on, catch me. Catch me. Do you think I can't catch you? She's going round and round. . . Catch me. . . .she's. . . she's running in circles. Yes. She's running, so what? So what? How is she related to you? Daughter. So her leg's not messed up? It's your head that's messed up, not her leg. But she was injured in a bus accident. Yes. Her leg was injured in the bus accident. She spent a couple of days in hospital then she came back. But she must be undergoing some treatment, right? Any medicines? She's done with her medicine and now it's time for my medication. Come on, come on. Let's go. You should do one thing. It's better if you bring my uniform here. Your daughter might not like it if I come. . . . . .to your house without warning. After all, she's counted amongst the civilized citizens. She's too civilized. . . No, no, no. According to me, she exceeds all the. . . . . .expectations of being civilized. Go. Come towards me, buddy. Why are you afraid? Why are you afraid? The bus is standing. . . and you're busy with your booze. You definitely must've sold tyres or something else. No, no. Hey, listen to me. Wait, Deepak. Listen to me. Enjoy the results, don't bother about the means. Seats, engines, tyres, everything. . . . . .is right where it needs to be. Why's the light on? Fireflies are at work. What? There must be a firefly in the bus. One firefly doesn't glow that bright. Who knows, there might be an entire family in there. You seem like you've lost your marbles. I've got to check out the bus. It's not good to spy when someone's working. Bad manners! The firefly is at work. I'm the one to spy. . . . . .and you have a problem? So. . . go after half an hour. They had asked for an hour. Who? Cow play. What? COUPLE. Couple? One male and one female. Darn it! You. . . You've lost your mind ! You've had too much to drink. I'm not going to spare those people. The R.T.O. is bugging me to my core. My reputation would've been completely ruined. . . . . .if the police had got hold of this. Hey, you people! Get out, whoever's inside. Sorry for the interruption. Fast, fast. Let's go. Why are you calling the entire town? Hey, get out fast. Why did you come here in this condition? You should've stayed home to rest. Chhoti's school fee is due. Yes. What's the use of resting at home? Yes, yes. Right. My whole life is ruined. I want to put a complete end to this issue. Forever! No. . . What do you mean? I mean, I want to get rid of all the inconsistencies. . . . . .in your accounts. It will settle all your desires, like opening a garment showroom. . . . . .and giving away gold coins for your cousin's wedding. Want some water? It's from the pot. Cold enough. Please come inside. Please sit down. Sit. How much did you pay for this crutch? Why? Nothing. I mean, it must be very difficult for you. . . . . .to walk without its support, right? What? Why does it feel like a bamboo stick? You want to know the truth. I fall ill whenever I think about your disease. I did some research, and then I found out. . . . . .that this. . . is not good. What? You're taking a huge risk. Who said that? I reached that conclusion after hearing them out. I'm in a hurry. . . I just. The face of truth is plagued with pores and pimples. But today. . . today you have to hear the truth. Doctors say that they need to cut off a leg. The new can come only when the old one goes. The. . . prosthetic one. The prosthetic one? Yes. But it looks very real. You can do all your walking, sitting and standing. Indian toilet, western commode. Everything's possible. And I will tell you, with the technology these days. . . . . .doctors today chop off legs like pastries. My leg. . . . . .will be chopped off. No, no. I don't want any operation. Why? You don't want to be all right? Tell me. You saw Naache Mayuri, right? You'll miss the National Award. You're such a brilliant actress. You. . . you can become a heroine. I'll get myself treated by my family doctor. You just need to continue with the payment, okay? I'll give you 100,000. I'll give it to the doctors. I'll only help you get better. The rickshaw is still outside, right? Let's go. We'll go right now and get you operated. What's the hurry? Why should one wait to do something good? I can't take that risk. What if the infection spreads? No. I'll shut the office and put the keys in my purse. You forgot your crutch. You might need to con someone else. If you want to run, run in the National Race. Run for the Delhi or Mumbai Marathon Race. Your father's trying to drown all his sorrows by drinking. Don't add to his misery! You better shut your mouth. I can live or die. Why do you care? I care. What will I do, if something happens to you? What? I'll have to bear the expenses, right? What is it to you? You get your payment the way you want to. On one hand, I end up believing your every lie. . . . . .and on the other, who doesn't want to believe the truth? She thinks she is the Queen of India. Sister, I was at Gopi's shop till it closed for the day. . . . . .but he didn't give me anything. He said, first clear all debts. . . . . .only then will I give you rice, pulses and oil. Veeru said the same thing. Clear all debts. . . . . .only then will I serve you more alcohol. Am I running away? Father. Come on. I drink on credit. I'll give money. Yes, come on leave. I need to trouble you. I have enough already. Pardon me for my behavior. I am very hungry. You should find a restaurant. I don't like eating out. I prefer homemade food. If it's possible, I would like to eat with your family. We don't need anyone's sympathy. Please leave. Sister. Father. Don't consider it sympathy. . . . . .but you can pay the bus fare later. He needs to be taken to a hospital immediately. Hey! Look out! Thank you, but you can leave now. This is a daily affair for me. Look, it won't do you any good. . . . . .if you're so cold. Just because I caught you red-handed. . . . . .you're being rude. It happens. That's life. I'm sorry but it was the. . . . . .lawyer who put me up to it. Your brother-in-law. Gradually, I realized they were using me. . . . . .to plot against you. But I enjoyed playing games with you. In the tailoring business. . . there isn't much money to be made. We are starving. By the way, how did he get addicted to alcohol? My sister passed away seVen years ago. Oh. I'm sorry. She wanted to educate herself. But my father forced her to get married. And then, the demands of her in-laws started. Munni was just a few months old when she. . . And since then your father has been punishing himself. I get it. Now he worries about me. With all the responsibility. . . . . .I don't want to get married. He thinks I should be married. And what do you think? Fear. Why? I am afraid to get married. What if I face the same issues as my sister? Drop all worries and get married and if. . . . . .I don't give you love, security and happiness. . . Tomatoes or my shoe? What? You want to hit me, right? Because when we met you warned me. . . . . .to never look at you. Since then, I've controlled my emotions. . . I mean my eyes. But today, I just can't. So what? I'm looking at you as well. . . . . .and I'll keep at it. Always. I am doing so because you just said I could. I'm going to look at you. So, do I take that as your confirmation? It's confirmed. You can look at me. Deepak! How much for the oranges? Rs. 12 a dozen. Where is Deepak? There he is. Give me the oranges. Deepak! What happened? Tell me, what happened? You will start a riot. Is anything wrong? I saw Harilal. Hail the Lord. Where did he go? Keep looking. Let me take a look. You ! You thief. You stole my money. I will. Wait. Your name means God but you're a thief. Your uncle is such a descent man. You are a hooligan. Why haven't I hit him yet? No. Don't hit him. I am absolutely furious. Let's take him to uncle. . . He's escaped. Where did he go? What? He ran away because of you. So, are you going to hit me? Are you crazy? I'm indebted to you. If not for the money, you'd hit me. Why are you arguing with me? Go catch him. Look for him. What is it? The union has taken a decision. And I have to follow it. No, follow it carefully. The union wants to give you another chance. But I have registered a complaint with the police. So, now the police will deal with it. Why does the union want to interfere? You thrashed Harilal black and blue. No I didn't. . . You think we allow that? Don't you think we're going to do anything about it? I didn't thrash him. I just lifted him up in midair, like a bag. Let's not discuss that. The union wants you to apologize to Harilal. . . . . .pay him compensation, pay his salary. . . . . .and appoint him back on the job. That's it. You should be honored for making such irrational demands. Hey. The consequences could be bad. Really. Now you've found your tongue as well. Do you want me to pretend to be scared? You don't have to. You'll get your chance. Before you do anything, keep in mind. . . . . .that the tables could turn. Long live. . . Gajender. We won't bow to this tyranny! Basantilal, blow the horn and drive ahead. They will clear a way. No, I can't do that. I am a member of the same association. I can't do that. Long live. . . Gajender. Long live. . . ABMU. We won't bow to this tyranny! Long live. . . Gajender. Long live. . . ABMU. We won't bow to this tyranny! Take a look. We won't bow to this tyranny! We won't bow to this tyranny! He has wrapped himself up in bandages. . . . . .to show that you've beaten him up. Live long ! Long live. . . Gajender. Long live. . . ABMU. Long live. . . ABMU. Long live. . . ABMU. We won't bow to this tyranny! So Singh. . . You've organized a rally? Mr. Nirmal, we laborers have to stand up to. . . . . .the tyranny of our masters. Long live. . . Gajender. We won't bow to this tyranny! So, you are the owner of Chal Chala Chal. Yes, and also the conductor. Mr. Omkarnath's son, Deepak. Yes. Mr. Deepak, I am the labor officer here. I work for the laborers, but I understand. . . . . .the plight of some of the owners. And in my experience, if problems continue. . . . . .between laborers and owners. . . . . .it could spoil relationships. Then finding a solution can be difficult. I can try to reach a compromise. Do you have a problem with that? Not at all. On the contrary, if you can do any good by talking to them. . . . . .it'll be better for all of us. Long live. . . Gajender. It's the same old thing, Mr. Nirmal. Due to the carelessness of the owner. . . . . .someone stole the money from the cash box. That's not true. Harilal had all the money with him. I didn't have a single penny. All the cash. Yes. That's difficult to believe, Deepak. Why? And after the theft, he kicked him out of his job. That's not true. Harilal left the job himself. I didn't fire him. He is telling the truth, and I am lying. Ask him if he attacked Harilal. Or is that a lie too? I can bring eyewitnesses. When I confront a thief that has stolen my money. . . . . .do you want me to praise him? It's so surprising, Deepak. Why didn't you lodge a complaint with the police. . . . . .right after the theft? Out of humanity. Harilal is a thief but his parents are not at fault. Have you seen his elderly parents? I have heard that story many times. Even a fool won't believe it, Mr. Nirmal. You're right. A fool can never understand humanity and truth. Hey! Mind your language. Just because you have a few pennies. . . . . .doesn't mean you are a businessman. You should also have business sense. Try to be faithful to your position. The position you hold doesn't transform. . . . . .a useless man into a leader. For that you need accurate thinking, proper planning. . . . . .and principles. Deepak. Just big talk. Calm down. Sir, I want to ask this leader a question. Has he ever driven a bus on twisted roads? Has he ever carried luggage? Has he ever issued tickets in a crowded bus? Has he worked a day in his life? But he is the leader of the laborers. He's not a true leader. He is only interested in the benefits of his position. Why have you called me here? To insult me? Tell me what about your demands? He will have to respect the laborers. He will have to apologize to Harilal. . . . . .and appoint him back on the job. Until then, this rally won't move. Take my advice. . . . . .and live on the street. . . . . .because I don't agree to these conditions. These rallies, public displays, stopping work for anything. . . . . .is not the right way, Singh. His company has taken the responsibility. . . . . .of providing people with work. . . . . .and you are provoking him. Are you on his side or mine? Are you an officer for the laborers or the owners? Singh, that's what every person thinks. Either this side or that. Left or right. Right or left. I can't take sides every time. Every problem has two aspects. . . . . .and we should be honest enough to accept this. It's true that Harilal ran away with the money, but. . . Who says? Him? You accuse a poor laborer without any evidence. I had my doubts. But now I am sure. How much did you pay him? Singh ! Watch what you say, alright? Parking, canteen, license, permits. You have a cut in everything. You worthless government officer. Leave him ! Look, his problem is me. Don't put your life at risk. And you. You have issues with me. Why would you attack him? I came here with an open mind. . . . . .but I have come to realize that compromise is a word. . . . . .the ignorant are unaware of. So, I won't discuss this any further. Deepak, you. . . It's beyond your reach now. Take a seat. Your intentions are not wrong. Just your position. Actually, it's not even your position. Whenever a descent man takes charge of this position. . . . . .he is always suppressed. The systems of our country have stooped to this level. So, please take a seat. Let me handle this my way. It's better that way. But if the need arises, I will knock sense where required. Down ! Down ! Down ! Down ! ABMU. We won't bow to this tyranny! Long live! Gajender! The bus is emitting too much carbon. I'm sure there's something wrong with the PUC. We just had it checked. I have the certificate. That doesn't count here. It doesn't count because all you're interested in. . . . . .is accumulating wealth. Because any fool can say that my tyres are new. . . . . .there are patches because. . . . . .there are potholes in the road. This is India. Rats, lizards, cockroaches. . . . . .goats, sheep and buffaloes can ride in the first aid box. And where did you learn o play with the wipers? Did you take any special training for that? Shut up. Just shut up. You don't know what a vehicle inspector is capable of doing. You will pay for this. You will have to pay for it as well. All the bribes, gold coins and sweets. Does anyone have an account of all that? It's just that I care about our relationship. Or else I could have dealt with this. Get lost! Brother, Sundar! We cannot park the bus here tonight. Quickly give me the keys. Have you been drinking with the tailor? I just took him home. Come, I'll take you home as well. No, listen to me. Singh has been acting up. He's preparing his men to destroy the bus. Give me the keys. I'll move the bus. You're taking a big risk by informing me. You are a member of the union. If you are caught, they won't spare you. I'll have to do it myself. Su ! Deepak! Deepak! Don't just sit there. They can attack our homes as well. We must do all we can to save our homes. They are a worthless lot. No, I won't let that happen. You've returned. Look what those goons have done to our house. Oh, my baby. Don't worry. What do you want to do? It's not my fault. It's not always tit for tat. Don't do this, son. When a father is insulted, a son must have revenge. Deepak! Listen to me. The police called. They are looking for you. Why are they looking for me? The one's they should be looking for move around freely. Stop it. We don't know what business you deal in. Or what you're really up to. But I can say one thing for sure. You have broken the law! Shut up. Why should we? We have to suffer for whatever you do. Look what they have done. Look. Will the women and children in this house. . . . . .sleep peacefully again? Deepak, you are the youngest. . . . . .and dearest to our father. At his age, you should look after him. . . . . .but he's still looking after you. Mr. Deepak, are you certain you do not require a lawyer? No, sir. I don't need a lawyer to tell the truth. I have all the answers. . . . . .to questions that pertain to this case. Sir, we went to meet Deepak. . . . . .with Harilal's issue. . . . . .but he attacked us. He's had quite a few fights with us lately. I swear to God, sir. Deepak started a fight the other night. We had to retaliate, but it was in self defense. Everything got worse from then on. Mr. Singh came to our hospital in a serious condition. His life was at risk. Mr. Deepak is short tempered by nature, Your Honour. His frequent physical violence and verbal threats. . . . . .are his first and natural reaction. This is the affidavit from Harilal's parents. I can't tell you how badly he beat me up. He'd threaten Basantilal and me all the time. I just wanted to buy his house. . . . . .and I offered him a good price too. I wanted a peaceful and friendly negotiation. Instead, he sent his men to threaten me. . . . . .telling me to stop provoking his brother-in-law. Is this right? No, no. You tell me. Is this right? It's not right to interfere in anyone's personal affairs. Even I understand that. I'd like to present an example of Mr. Deepak's attitude. . . . . .towards his passengers, as the owner of the bus. I mean, the way he spoke was strange. I never said anything because. . . he's a man. But one day he caught my hand. He's had many arguments with R.T.O. officers. The car would arrive and then the arguments soon after. To hell with the passengers. Once he even shattered the glass of an R.T.O. officer's car. The respectable officer doesn't want to come to court. . . . . .to testify because Deepak is his brother-in-law. Deepak may not have any regard for their relationship. . . . . .but he does. Another one of Deepak's brothers-in-law is a lawyer. . . . . .and it's worth considering. Why wouldn't a lawyer take up his brother-in-law's case? I think, Your Honour, he's a social outlaw. Mr. Deepak, you have to say something. What can I say, sir? After stepping into this court. . . . . .I've come to realize that the truth. . . . . .isn't enough to affirm oneself. One needs proof. Some things that happen between two people. . . . . .can't be proved even by God himself. This washer woman, this Harilal, this builder. . . . . .this ruffian, this official who roughed up my house. . . Even I can make twice as many accusations. . . . . .about each of them, but I won't. I know that this court is a place to be honest. Although it's a whole different issue that. . . . . .this place has been transformed. . . . . .into a place where the truth is fabricated. They have looked at my life. . . . . .like blind men would try to feel an elephant. While one thinks its limbs are bamboo sticks. . . . . .another mistakes its tail for a broom. If my enemies were driven through the forest several times. . . . . .because of a love that is so hurtful and fragrant. . . . . .then maybe that would knock. . . . . .some sense into their heads. But for that you must know the complete story regarding. . . . . .all the incidents that took place at home, at work. . . . . .in town and in the bus. Do you realize how much you've spoilt him? Because of him, you are going through so much at this age. Did you hear that, Father? Did you hear that? What are you waiting for? Bring it here. Bring the keys to the cupboard. . . . . .so that I can shove the office rent into the owner's face. Where's the money in your locker? It needs to be withdrawn from the bank. Why should you withdraw? Let him reap, he who sowed. Do you see, Father? Do you see? We wouldn't see days like this if you had sold the house. We would've had some cash in hand, some in the lockers. . . . . .and some in the house. But no. You and your stubborn nature. You've never paid heed to our words. What does one do? Stop this drama, both of you. I'm strong enough to bear my own troubles. I know how to get rid of this burden. Sir, these two applications have come in. Permission granted. Labour officer Nirmal Kumar. I was trying to resolve the differences. . . . . .between the union leader and Deepak when this started. Singh hit me and even tried to kill me. . . . . .but Deepak stopped him. I was so impressed by Deepak's honesty. . . . . .and sensibility, that in spite of being a labor officer. . . . . .I came to defend an employer. Where's the second applicant? Bus driver, Basantilal. There's certainly a drawback in my master. People think with their minds. . . . . .he thinks with his heart and gets messed up with the world. This is the only drawback in him. He goes to extremes with both love and anger. He's a sweet and sour person, sir. Just like a half ripe mango. But he knows that whether he lost his temper. . . . . .or treated us with love, the fault was always ours. He's forgiven so many of mine and Harilal's mistakes. . . . . .with only as much as a mild scolding. I kept silent for the fear of Mr. Singh. . . . . .and even now, I know I'll have to pay for speaking up. But the kindness, commitment and gentleness. . . Today, I can muster up all my courage and say. . . . . .that it's Singh who destroyed my master's bus. . . . . .and tried to kill him. It's all a preplanned conspiracy. The other day I went to the union office for some work. . . . . .and there I saw Singh sitting with his juniors. . . . . .hatching a conspiracy to trouble my master. The court has tried to look at the case. . . . . .from a humanitarian perspective. Due to the lack of credible evidence from both sides. . . . . .it is difficult to pass a judgment. But justice evolves, not from the books of law. . . . . .but from the good sense of reasoning. That is what the court has tried to adhere to. The court has a word of advice for Deepak. Just because you haven't wronged anyone. . . . . .you can't take for granted that no one will wrong you. Because a charging bull spares no one coming in its way. The attempt to murder charges on Deepak. . . . . .as alleged by Gajendra Singh. . . . . .have been dismissed as baseless by the court. Deepak is hereby proved innocent. It's looking as good as new. Where did you find so much money to spend? Where have you been hiding it? I earned some things and lost some others. Our house is not only ours anymore. It's become home to many more people now. The house. . . did you sell it? I want you, not the house. . . . . .because no house in the world is larger than your heart. On my deathbed, would I calculate. . . . . .what gains and losses I made in life? Or just look at your happy eyes and die in peace? Why do you talk like that, Father? Do you think that my most priced possession. . . . . .was that house? No, son. You are my most priced possession. You've done so much for me. Now it's my turn. That house was home to so many memories. Memories are cherished in the heart, not in a house. Such phases will come and go. Just remember one thing. Home is where the heart is. Home is where true relations exist. Dear, why do you need to buy a ticket? From this day forth, this bus and its owner, belong to you. Come. Okay. There's money. As well as honey. Talk to me. Talk to me. Talk to me. We have money, as well as honey. We have money, as well as honey. We have money. . . . . .as well as honey. We are rich at heart too. Let's face whatever happens. Let's create a commotion. Come on, let's do some magic. Come on, let's do some magic. Since, I've got the money. My beloved loves me dearly. Since, I've got the money. My beloved loves me dearly. Why see me from far? Come closer to me. Talk to me with love. We all are love struck. Come on, let's do some magic. Talk to me like you do it. Talk to me like you mean it. Talk to me, you're my baby. Rock, will you rock? Talk to me. Oh dear, I love you. I won't stay far from you. What have you said? I am feeling proud. Don't leave me and go away. Why do you ask me stupid questions? Come on, let's do some magic. Come on, let's do some magic. We have money. . . . . .as well as honey. We have money. . . . . .as well as honey. We have money as well as honey. We are rich at heart too. Let's face whatever happens. Let's create a commotion. Come on, let's do some magic. Come on, let's do some magic. Come on, let's do some magic.
