Poor fellow! Like his lessons in algebra, he can never understand his parents too. This is Gopalrao's elder sister And this is his brother in law. Gopalrao gave dowry for her sisters sake. This man gave it back to Gopal Rao as loan and is extracting interest. Actually, loan is just a reason for him to settle in this house. Just like a crow that found grain. What? Isn't your brother paying the interest this time? He cant take me for granted just because he is brother in law. I will be dead before that. Remove your hand first or you will actually die. Oh! My! This body which is rolling and slopping is, Otthu. He is usually the victim of meenakshi's devotion. Govinda! Govinda! Govinda! Govinda! Govinda! Govinda! You must be wondering who this Gopalrao is-- He is a good man who appears bad or vice versa. When all others believe in God he lives selling the God. - Otthu. - Lord Vinayaka. Please save me god. Come fast. Seems like people are ready to build a temple if we are late. Thanks! What is this.. they don't even stop praying the idol even here. Guruji! Why is God wearing your helmet? Look at the people out there. Now God needs more safety than me. It is empty now. Didn't understand? An ice cream seller has to sweat in the in hot sun... ...but he has to keep the ice cream in the freezer. That is not fair Guruji. You cant compare God with that. Your God doesn't have an address if I don't sell him. Now tell me who Is great? Him or the one who give him shelter. Do you have Gangajal? Of course we have. Guruji just filled it up. Piled it up is what he is saying. Here.. Fresh Gangajal. Just arrived in the morning from Gangotri in Ganga travels. Is it? What is this Guruji? Great woman, she could smell and identify Gangajal. Is it the first time you are getting on to a bike? Yes sir. Muhurat is approaching. Are you ready? One.. two.. sit properly.. three. Shit. What sir? Sneeze, this damn sneeze. If there is one sneezes before dying even death will halt. Now riding this bike is like getting into coffin. You better discard this. It is a new vehicle.. I cant do that! - Why did you buy this new trouble? - Please do it quickly. Donate it to a priest like me. This is the Superstitions. "If you see a cat, you believe that your work will fail." "But when the cat sees you, it will be disaster for her." "You believe that lizards speak truth but bad luck if they fall on you." "Stamping on fox tail is luck but when it howls its a bad omen." "Why? Why? Why all this?" "Why? Why? Two limbs we all have." "But the right is more auspicious. Why these blind faiths?" "Why? Why?" "Why the faiths of Architecture.. as the earth is around like a ball." "If you have the courage, you don't need holy threads." "If you have strength in your soul, the talismans are nothing." "Hands are for acting but not for rings with colour stones." Oh god. Mom said that if I write the saikoti, saibaba will come. My dads last wish was to take all the families in this colony to Varanasi. I request all of you to join our trip to Varanasi... ...and give peace to my fathers soul. Your family must join. Yeah. Definitely. I will not come. It is only for four days. Lets go please. You tell him. We can do the rituals in Ganga in the name of our forefathers. Why should we go to Kaasi and waste food there? We can as well feed someone here. He said that his father soul will rest in peace if we all go. Oh poor! He was bed ridden for two years and this son never turned up! He was counting dollars in America. Now all this is for building reputation Daddy please daddy! Lets go daddy. It will be good, it seems. Guruji. Idols are sold cheap in Kaasi. If we can get one load... ...it will be bhajan trip for them and business trip for us. So, when are we leaving? You were not interested just now. What would I do when children are insisting. Play, you play man. Oh lord! "Oh Govinda! Gopala! Butter Thief!" "Where did you go after stealing butter?" "Oh Govinda! Gopala! Butter Thief!" "Where did you go after stealing butter?" "Gopal! Oh Nanda Gopal!" "Oh Govinda! Gopala! Butter Thief!" "Where did you go after stealing butter?" "Go.. Go.. Go.. Gopala." "Go.. Go.. Go.. Gopala." "Go.. Go.. Go.. Gopala." "Go.. Go.. Go.. Gopala." Give me four dozen Ganesha with big belly. Flute Krishna two dozen... ...that six pack Hanuman a dozen. And yes that lady on the tiger, give six of them. Bhai.. She is Goddess Durga. Yeah yeah Durga. What is the total? Total six dozens. Six dozens? Then you must give at least three Saibaba as bonus! Play, you play man. - Bhai, come here. - What? I have one miraculous idol. Maha Shivling. It emerged from the ground! Only one lakh! One lakh? You should know that I am the master of this story! You are just a small kid. Pack and send the order. You cant fool me. One lakh eh? Believe it or not! You have to follow some traditions. You know that I don't believe all this! Then why did you come to Kaasi? He is like that! Please continue. Not that. You carry on.. Go on.. you know I don't like these all. You carry on.. Go on. Such a wastage of food! Hey! Otthu. Guruji. Did you stock the goods in the shop? Did that last night. Check for the prices marked by them and remove them. Stick our slips but don't write any price. Okay sir. And then watch out how I would be selling. No.. No.. I cant sell this. This is a miraculous statue. Its a kind that emerged. Emerged? Yeah... Emerged in Badrinath. Once my business ran into losses and I went to Badrinath for peace of mind. I saw a sadhu fainted with thirst. I gave him water and saved him. And he was so impressed that he presented this to me. My life changed from then. I built this shop, bought a triple bed room house with attached bathroom. You see attached bathroom. All this because of this cute little Kannayya. I can give away my Kannayya. You take anything but this. No I want just this one. I have three wife's. Six kids. And twenty five lakh dues on betting. I am doomed brother. I need this statue. I cant give it that way Sethji. There is something else. The Sadhu told me that a Baba devotee would come from Rajasthan... ...and that I should give this to him. Please understand. Oh! Brother!! I am that.. I am that Rajasthani. Look the car is registered in Rajasthan. And that quotation of Baba.. I am that Baba devotee.. Bhanwarlal. Are you Bhanwarlal? I am Bhanwarlal. - And that is Rajasthan vehicle. - Yes. - Baba Devotee. - Yes. Hey Otthu. He is Bhanwarlal. Yeah! I am Bhanwarlal. A devotee of Shirdi Sai baba.. a Rajasthan vehicle. Oh Kanniah, you are there! Take this bhanwarlal sir, it is yours. Come my Nandalal. Only hundred rupees? Otthu, you shouldn't ask. He'll give to God. Remember when I gave all my gold for this? That's why I am earning this much. It is going to be the same for Sethji too! He gives a hundred he will get two or three hundreds. Even I have gold. I will also give everything. All my losses and troubles will be gone. I will keep this statue and start betting. I'll take leave brother! Take it and just don't turn around. - Okay, see you. - Come my Nanadalal, come to me! I knowing cheating is bad but believing in cheaters is worse. My business is safe as long as such people survive. We see people rushing to walk on fire. Even kids and women are prepared to walk... ...believing that their wishes will be fulfilled. You are witnessing those scenes now. Otthu Seems like all troubles will be gone if you walk on the fire. Do you want to try? Where did this emerge from? Dwaraka. The birth place of Srikrishna. Hail the great teacher! Lets see the speciality of this place. Hey why is she here? The devotion of that great lady is balancing out your sins guruji. Stop that nonsense and shut down the shop. Gopalrao bhai. What is it Aslam bhai? Can you keep an eye on my shop for a month? Are you going somewhere? I am in troubles bhai! I thought I visit Allah in Mecca and take his blessings. Aslam Bhai.. Why don't you pray to Allah from here and get your shop repaired? It looks as if it is going to fall apart soon. That's fine. Keep this. Ask your children to get this repaired before you come back. Dear Devotees... ...do you know about the birthday gift given by that God to this God? God appeared in my dream and asked me to show all the devotees the path to moksha. I have used all my powers to create that Moksha Kund. Walk on that fire and you will be crossing past your troubles and ailments. "Hail Siddhaguru. Hail Siddhaguru. Hail Siddhaguru." Thank you Swamiji for coming to my constituency. Your blessings will help me get all these votes. I and God had a discussion about you during a dream last night. Rayudu. He asked me to perform rituals here and that you will be blessed. Blessing Swamy? Blessing means benefit son. Benefits you may be! "Hail Siddhaguru. Hail Siddhaguru." - You stay here. - Okay guruji. "Siddhaguru... Siddhaguru.. Siddhaguru." Meenakshi.. Moksha, no. "Siddhaguru... Siddhaguru.. Siddhaguru" Stop that nonsense.. That's enough. "Siddhaguru." Peace. Listen all of you! Let me deliver Siddeswar Maharajs message. When did I give message? Dear Devotees! On the occasion of Siddeswar Maharajs birthday... ...Srikrishna himself came to our colony. He is eating bowls and bowls of butter. All this is because of the blessings of Maharaj. Go ahead Give Kanha butter and make your mukthi chances better. My wife gave him half kilo butter and lost hundred grams weight. Mukthi on the way. All this wonderful chance for only one hour. Come on Go ahead. Rush quick. Don't loose the chance of feeding butter. Devotees. Devotees. You won't get such a chance again. Devotees! Devotees! Why are you leaving? Who asked you to go? Go.. Go.. Go. You should leave only when I say! Why are people running away? Where are they going? You sees, even he is asking you to go come on go away. You sees, even he is asking you to go. You make my son walk on the fire listening to some fool... ...come on go away. You idiot, stop man. You are a sinner! Do you know the consequence of Gods anger! Do you know what happens if a man get angry, show your anger on your devotees. You fool! You are spoiling a ritual meant for mankind's prosperity. You are insulting the sacred Hindu tradition. You will be ruined! Completely ruined! Swami what happened? You have disturbed God. You will now face the consequence. Disaster you life will be disaster. We won't spare you! Count your days! Stop that! You better eat whatever you can, go home and take rest! It is likely to rain. His acts are results of his bad time. His acts are results of his bad time. Nonbelievers will be ruined. Ruined. This is my curse. Breaking news. from across the country that miraculously Lord Krishna is consuming milk and butter. Have it Krishna. Please! This is zero cholesterol. It will be good for your health. Is Krishna having butter? No he isn't even after I told him that it is 100 percent fat free. Is your Krishna eating butter? No. I have been requesting him but he isn't eating. Uncle, looks like people have taken your words seriously. This news is spread all over. With cameraman Srinivas-- You have spoiled one Godly affair and now ridiculing it. You will be punished. What kind of beliefs are these walking on fire will compensate bad deeds... ...ridiculing will be punished. This earth quake is because of your act. You call this earthquake not even a small vessel moved. Gopalam. What man? Is Krishna in your house eating butter. He already consumed half a kilo. But he not having it in my house. Did you have head bath today morning. No, I didn't. See that is the problem. Do it and Krishna will consume butter. I will try that. Brother.. switch on TV5. What is that so important on TV now? There was a mild earthquake this evening in Hyderabad. It is measured 3.5 on rector scale. No causalities but one shop that sells idols got collapsed in main bazaar. The visuals on screen are that of Gopalrao's collapsed shop. Surprisingly many other shops around which are still worse are not affected. This is the only shop that got damaged. With cameraman parsad this is Priyanka. Switch on the TV and watch the news. We are watching Dad. All other shops in the market are fine. It is only our shop that is damaged His lives on Gods but denies His existence. Isn't it surprising that only his shop got damaged? Poor man! How will he run his family now? His family is on the streets for the sins he committed. If you go against God, result come up in few minutes. People are saying that Swamiji cursed him. We got this renovated recently. Doesn't look like there was a shop here. Gopal, you need not give me any interest from now on. Please give the whole money immediately. Is this the time sir? Guruji is worried that he lost eighty lakhs. Eighty lakhs? The worth of stock inside was fifty lakhs... ...and about a month back we spent thirty lakhs for renovation. Eighty lakhs? Where did you get all that money? I kept my house documents in the bank and got sixty lakhs. Bava gave me twenty. Twenty? Wasn't that only Ten lakhs? He gave without your notice. Was greedy for high interest. Why did you give him without informing me? Now see the entire money gone into that dust. Stop that Dad! The shop anyways is gone and please ensure that you don't leave in this world. Whats about me dear Gopal? Brother in law only the shop that has collapsed, not me. Bank account has a balance of thirty thousand. We don't have anything else to sell. How can we ever clear these debts? You shouldn't have ridiculed God. This would have never happened. Now, stop that devotion channel. What are you trying to say? I went against the God and you think he destroyed my shop? To prove his existent the non-existing God came down to destroy my shop. Yes. Stop that! I made no loss. See this. Where is he going with that key? Do you know what this is? Insurance claim for one crore. Every paise lost will come back to me... ...and I still don't believe in God. Not only now but I will never believe in him. God some how, make sure we receive the claim amount. We will leave if you give us our money. Rolex!! No, it is dummy. Rambabu, isn't that a Rolex watch on your hand? Worth a lakh? Ten lakhs. - Oh! - That is. Actually we want leave if you settle the amount. Mister Gopalrao! Have you read all the terms and conditions before taking the policy? No I didn't! Your agent marked tick and asked me to sign there. I did. What happened sir? You cant be that irresponsible. Insurance police means securing in advance. Why would you take a policy? To secure yourself from incidents like theft, fire accident, fraud etc.. Right? Correct sir. That is why we took this policy. But this claim is invalid. Because this is Act of God. Act of God. Look here. Its clearly written. Conditions apply. In the event of loss or damage caused to the property... ...the insurance company is not liable to pay any amount... ...with damages caused by ACT OF GOD. And here is your signature accepting this. Sir, these letters are small like ants. How can any human read this? But what is meant by ACT OF GOD sir. That means.. Any natural calamity which has no human interference. Means? Earthquake, tsunami, thunder storm etc. Our company cant compensate for such events which are caused by god. But I don't believe in God. Tell him. Yes sir. We are not concerned whether you believe or not! We have agreement signed by you. I am sorry. Sorry? What for? I have invested all my money on this shop... ...and my house is also on mortgage. You claim is invalid. You may leave now. I cant sir. I will not leave this place till I get my claim money. Security! Why are you calling security? I am asking for money that I should get. - Take them out. - Sir I am trying to explain you calmly. Please listen to me sir. - All details are in this file. - Get up. Leave me. Leave me. Why is this invalid? All other are in big fonts but when it comes to conditions they are minute. You are playing around snatching my money! You cheats! What did you say? Check your mouth! - What would you do? Damn it! You guys cheated me saying that I will get back everything. Just get out. And you say your watch's worth ten lakhs... ...must have got it for two thousands in the chor bazaar. Don't you understand? We have our rules to follow. It is an act of God. What can we do things done by God? If you want money go and ask God. It is an act of God. What? Its an Act of God? Act of God? Wait hold this. Act of God! That means that you believe in God? Yes I do. And that God is omnipresent? Yes. - In him? - Yes. - This man? - Yes. - This man? - Yes. - In that Madam? - Yes. Rambabu you really believe that God is there in me too. Yes I do. Thank you sir. No No.. It is not me. God! God is hitting him. Leave me.. leave me. God is doing this!! Not me! Not me!! God! See God is beating him again. God in me is slapping you. Fight between God and God. Act of God! Again. It is He that hit! Give that gun! How dare you loot my money! Please sir. God in me is shoot up God in you. - Is that fine? - No! Will your family get you death claim or will it be another act of God? Lets try and see. - Lets see. - No sir, no. Act of God. it Seems. Act of God. Get back to work. Ramji.. Don't worry. We will pay back all the loan and interest soon and collect the house documents. Please understand Ramji Guruji, Ramji has given us one month time. He will sell this house to someone else if fail to pay him before that. I have put up the shop area for sale. Check whats happening with that. Okay. Guruji.. Ramji want to talk to you. Yeah Sethji. Did you find anyone to buy that land? What? What happened? He is saying that the land became unholy... ...after the idols of God fell and broken on it. No one is ready to buy such inauspicious place. After a century when these idols are dug out... ...the price of the land will shoot up hundred times. Temple will be built on that site. Just leave it if there isn't anyone to buy that place. Bloody believes. Don't get tensed. God is testing us. He will help us. I owed to fast for hundred and one Monday for Lord Ram. I am also writing Rams name million times. Ram's name is great! No one gives you a million... ...if you write His name a million times! Do one thing. Why don't you ask God to give you any of his ornaments? He will definitely give. And if you ask him, he will give it faster. What are you saying? I am asking you to ask Him. May be he will give. Yes. I will ask him in a way that he cannot refuse. Guruji.. Guruji. - Suicide.. No.. No.. Stop. - Leave me. Leave me. I am not a coward to do that. I am going to court of law. Stop that Guruji. You cant easily sue a company that has three thousand crores. They must have seen many like you. I know that many like me must have sued the company. But none must have sued Krishna. I will sue god. One who has ruined a life should taken to the court, even if it's God. I will do that! "Have your filled your belly with our offerings?" "One to correct your mistakes and rewrite destiny..,." "...has started his war.. Check out!" Why are you late? I had a sprain when I was trying yoga this morning. I cant come, you please go ahead. What? That's fine. You need not get down I will get on the bike. Hold this! Don't worry... ...if your determined the god whom you believe in can also be called down. Guruji. How is this possible? How can God come to court? There is a temple beside court. Visiting time is 9 AM to 7 PM. There is a lunch break in between. He can pull out time then and come to court. Guruji is not possible. You calm man. Allow me to take up your case. I am best in argument. Hey, stop. What is this nuisance? You come here. They are juniors. - Your-- - I am senior lawyer. I win all the cases I take up. Even if the culprit is God he would step down for my argument. Then he is correct. Tell me sir. My shop was unfairly broken down sir. Then it is a big case. Does the other guy has big background. Like all big men, he himself is his background. Don't worry. I will win the case. I guarantee you. Fine, tell me his name. God. Okay.. God. What is his last name? Last name? Yeah, last name. Like Jonnalagadda, Bapineedu something or other! I know that he has got many names but last name is never heard of. That's fine if doesn't have last name. Give me his address, we will certainly win. There are different addresses sir... ...care of Kasi, Tirupathi some say Srisailam and some Shabarimalai.... ...there are more too. Which God are you talking about? The same one who lives in temple Brahma, Vishnu, Maheswar, Anjaney, Ram, Krishna... There are some ladies too! Lakshmi, Saraswathi, Parvathi, Durga-- Why are you sitting like a humpty dumpty? Couldn't you tell me that this man is mad. The benches would be broke.. be careful! Sir, please listen to me. What to listen? You are saying care of Tirupathi, Srisailam, Annavaram. Do I look like a fool to you? Sir, please listen to me. What is there for you to tell and me to listen? You have wasted an hour for me. - Take him away, Take him. - Move guruji. A case on God? This is what I get, so early in the morning. Hey! Didn't I ask you to change the lemons daily? You fool. How can you run a case on God? Are you possessed by any demon? Lawyer sir, my case. You don't want me to sit here at least under this tree? Why don't you leave go. Sir. I will plead you. Don't make me do this kind of sins. Please go away. - Sir, Sir Listen to me Sir please wait. - Are they afraid of God? Alas! What is this? Why are all running away? What to do now Guruji? Don't worry We are going to meet advocate Akbar Khan. He had been a famous lawyer. If he takes up this case, we will win... Another lawyer? I will stay little away for safety. Okay. Where is lawyer Akbhar khan house here. Go straight and take left. Is Mr. Khan home? Dad is inside. Please come. Seems like your are in lot of trouble. I fought a case some time back. I stood with innocent Hindus. My people didn't want me to stand for them. Father cant walk. We amidst people who kill each other in the name religion. You are trying to sue their God on whom they have blind faith. Can you fight till it ends? I do not have any other option Khan Bhai. Look at me. I cant fight your case in this condition. You can fight your case when no other lawyer is willing. There is a provision in the law. I will take fees but you have taken pain. Your arguments will be genuine. I can only help in one aspect. I'll prepare your legal notice. Okay? Thank you very much Khan Bhai. Fine. Where should I send these notices? Address? Don't you have one? Judge will then strike off the case on day one! I don't have Gods address but I know the place where people go in search of God. Relax Swamiji. Relax. Gopal Rao was a common man who lost everything in an earthquake. Now he took it upon God. He has sent summons to all the religious leaders, swamiji's. People who believe in God are protesting across country. Sankarnarayana a lawyer who has never lost case accepted. The case has become more interesting when he fight the case on behalf of God. Relax Swamiji.. Relax. Court will never accept this. I will take care of this. You don't even have to come to the court. Swami, I think we should call him and understand from him. Our policies might be different but paths are same. Our objectives might be different but our God is same. Today a common man pulled God to court. This is not a personal fight. This is fight for all those who believe in God. God means justice. People go to court for justice... ...you have dragged justice to court. Me, Siddheswar Maharaj... ...and Gopika Matha are going to the court. We will ensure that the fool is taught a lesson. We have decided to attend the court. Gopalrao Down Down! Down Down Gopal Rao!! For the first time in the world a common man has gone against God in the court. Is that possible? Yes, this is democracy. And before democracy even God is also equal to human. Even if the god is done mistake... ...just like humans he should be bought to the court of law. Here is Gopalrao challenging the God. Think about it again. Oh what is this. Jai Sri Ram. What a good omen. Do you even remember whom we have to fight tomorrow? - Useless guy! - Jai Sri Ram! Hey. we don't need that. Go away. You move. Today is the day for first hearing. Will the case be accepted or not? The entire country is eagerly waiting for the decision. Many devotees are calling slogans against Gopalrao. All the Gods are walking into the court. Swami, What do you have to say upon this matter. Gopalrao.. down! Down! Gopalrao.. down! Down! Mr. Gopalrao, all say this is a publicity stunt.. what do you have to say? Sir, Gopalrao. Salute. Why are you here? Father send me here. Please sit there. When asked by judge-- Hey Insurance. How is the Rolex? Is it working fine? Relax, you go and sit there. Ten lakhs watch eh? He is the same fool who destroyed my Yagna that day. He is running around court because of my curse. Only him! Silence! Guruji, get up. - Kanneganti Gopalrao. - Present Sir. Order.. Order. Are you fighting your own case. What do I do when no lawyer is willing to take up the case? That's why, I am fighting my case. My lord, this is a baseless case. Just for publicity. There is no cause of action that can be proved in court. So I suggest under order 7, rule number 11 of the code of civil procedure... ...this can be straight away dismissed for out of clause action. Thank you. Sir! I don't know much of English. Even if I have that will be of no use here. Let me take the help of my mother tongue. He is asking you to close this case. For such lawyers each case is like a suitcase. But for people like me it is our anguish and tears. Please let us express them. Judge. My shop collapsed due an earthquake I have one crore insurance on that shop. Insurance company men are saying that they that God had destroyed my shop. They say it is an Act of God. Whoever caused the damage should pay the compensation. So I am asking God. You fool! If you go against God, you will be destroyed. Order.. Order. If you have anything to say please come to the witness box. Let the ignorant mistakes be pardoned. Bhagawan please forgive this fool. I will pray to your feet tonight when we meet in my dream. Spare his ignorance. Hey! Why would God destroy your shop? That is exactly what I am telling. He must be having other important works. Why would he leave all that and fall on my shop. Please tell the company guys to pay me my money sir. Objection, your honour! Why should they give you money at all? You have signed their terms and conditions. Exhibit number one! Then it should be the God who should be paying. Call him. Ram or Krishna or Shiva. Say those weird chants and call them. God will only appear before the pious to give them moksha... ...not before fools like you. For him to come, he should first exist. You anyways have hundreds of crores turnover in your shops. Give me a crore. I can give you cash discount also I object your honor. He is calling that service as Gods business. Service? Where is service? From the shoe stand outside the temple to the worship everything is business sir. Coconuts for sale, flowers for sale, fruits for sale. There are rates for simple puja, special puja and all other types of puja. What is all this? Isn't it business? If you call a free visit dharma darshan... ....then paid ticket visit should be called adharma darshan. Infact when there is a recession every other business suffers... ...but this business doubles. All those who land up in trouble will come with gifts asking for solutions. This is a business which is always in profits. And on top of it, there are tax benefits as well Isn't it Swamy? Relax. Let us say they are doing business. But you have paid premium in insurance company to ask for a claim. Why should these people pay you compensation? Because I have also paid premium in their Mandirs. What? What nonsense? I know that you will not believe me. So, I brought all proofs. These are receipts proving that I have paying premium... ...in different temples for the last eighteen years. These I paid when my mother was alive and these when my wife asked me to do so. See. This is the first premium I paid. One thousand one hundred and sixteen. I paid this in a big temple in Madhurai. I am also paying five thousand to your Ganapathi stall every year. That is not stall you fool, that is called mandap. My grandmother fell ill three years back. Doctors lost their hope. A sidhanti said that she will survive if I conduct mrutunjay homam(ritual). I did so. I lost my grandmother and also thirty thousand. Chaddar's given to Dargah's, candles donated in churches... ...incense sticks given to babas, clothes given to Goddesses... ...all these around ten lakhs paid across those shops. Hey you! Mindless fool! Why are you calling them Shops? They are temples. Temple is what you should call them. They are all donations given be people who believe... ...that it would help them in family's safety and security. Exactly! Now where is my family security? Then, you should go and ask the God himself? Why are you asking these swamiji's? Yeah! You have a point? What SIM do you use in your mobile? Reliance. If you have problem in service do you call to the customer care... ...or will you call Ambani and talk to him? Order. Order. Are you saying that they are all officers of God? No.. No. How can you call them officers? Look at them. They are all salesmen. Collection agents of God. Your honor, He is an atheist. He doesn't understand what he is speaking. As we are hermits we will forgive him. But God will never spare him. If you speak wrong about God you cant even step out of your house. Oh! Are you concerned about me or are you trying to threaten me... ...in the presence a Judge? We are only concerned about you. Then give me the money and close this matter. My lord, this is enough. They are just receipts of donations. There is no agreement between God and this man. Gopalrao is talking all nonsense. I don't understand why he should initiate a case against for such a silly thing. Silly thing? This not a silly thing. The shop that I lost is like my mother who feeds me. When I lost my father I was a kid. I didn't cry but I was afraid. But when my shop is destroyed I felt like crying. I was not afraid. Because I believed in you. The temple men assure that no harm happens to one who donates. Insurance company men assure that if I pay regular premium. We will take care of the misshapenness. I gave donations and also the premiums. Both of them are backing off. My family is amidst the roads. My son.. I cant see any future for my kid sir. I don't know where to go. I am requesting you to allow me place my case to the court your honor. One crore is a huge sum for a middle class man. This in specific is his source of income. Hence this court decides to accept this case. Whether this man will get his compensation? If yes from whom, the insurance company or the Temple committee... ...will be decided by the court based on evidences and arguments. The court is adjourned. This is government place. You might be safe here. But how will you escape after leaving this place? Like you believe in God, he believes in court. If God is omnipresent he is present in the court as well. God is there in every human being so he is in him. He is also God. Leave him. Otthu, I will visit lawyer and come home. You be careful. Okay guruji. Unexpectedly the court has accepted to take up Gopalrao's case. Many religious heads and people are protesting this decision. Swami, devotion alone is not sufficient, fear of God is also essential. Don't spare him. Bhupal, forgiving is virtue. Let everything happen as per Gods wish. Is everyone ready? That fellow is just a human, but he forgot fear and devotion. You guys should remind him. Thanks Khan Bhai. Tea is good. You are alone in this war. But madness usually has an army. People who think that they are doing a righteous job. Be careful. - I'll take leave. - Okay. Why are you following me? Are you trying to threaten and scare me? Come on! Hey, want to see God? In the last moment you'll see a light.. that is God. Let me show you. "Gopala! Gopala!" "Govinda.. Gopala!" "Gopala.. Gopala! Govinda.. Gopala!" "Gopala.. Gopala! Govinda.. Gopala!" "Gopala.. Gopala! Govinda.. Gopala!" "Gopala.. Gopala! Govinda.. Gopala!" "One who comes to devotee's rescue.. that's Gopala." "One who always resides in devotee's hearts.. Gopala." "You appear in the world when it needs you." "Show your might and style.. go.. go.. Gopala" "Gopala.. Gopala!" "Gopala.. Gopala!" "Gopala.. Gopala! Govinda.. Gopala!" "Gopala.. Gopala! Govinda.. Gopala!" Who are you brother? You just came like God to save me. No I came like a human you see. Yeah you are right brother. Only a man will save another and not God. Reduce the speed! What is this vehicle? What is this driving? What is this speed brother! Speed is not in the vehicle friend! It is in the blood of the driver! So you have a lot of experience in driving. A lot-- Don't do such scary things. I was the driver in Abhimanyus marriage and Arjuns war! "Gopala.. Gopala! Govinda.. Gopala!" "Gopala.. Gopala! Govinda.. Gopala!" Hey, don't go there, its one way. Hey vehicle-- Get aside. aside. I am screwed. Oh My. We are gone now. What is this entire stunt? You don't seem to have fear. Fear? That I gave it to my Uncle. Uncle? Who is he? Kamsa! Arjun, Kamsa meaning are you Krishna. Yes! Oh man I am dead. Wow.. I am still alive. Brother They are coming. Go! Get them! "Gopala.. Gopala! Govinda.. Gopala!" "Gopala.. Gopala! Govinda.. Gopala!" "Show your might and style.. Gopala." "You come to protect your devotees." - Are you mad. - "Oh Gopala!" "You are proving a point to the world." "Show your might and style.. go.. go.. Gopala." What is this thing coming towards us. We escaped. Will you drop to Gandhinagar. What happened brother? Why did you stop? Go straight and take right, then left and you will be home. Now that you came till here, why don't you drop me at home? Look friend! My job is to show you the way, reaching the destination is your job. Okay, Thanks. Here, keep this hundred. You didn't tell me your name. Govind Gopala Hari. Nice name. Kamalanatha Kamalanayana Mohana Muralikrishna... ...Jagadesha Jagadguru Jagannatha Janarthana. What is all this brother? You asked my name, didn't you? Few more to go Madhusudhana, Giridhara, Manohara, Madhava. Enough enough. Thanks for dropping me. This guy is completely mad! Vasudeva Vishnu Paramathma Parabramha Paraasakthi Narayana Narayana Narayan. Come fast.. Lets leave before the bad time. Brother in law. Here comes the bad time. I thought I will earn something by giving loan to you and staying in our house. See what I could earn. - I am sorry Brother in law. - Now stop that brother in law. Get on! - Uncle! - Enough of what you did. Brother in law- See. Everyone is leaving. Come on. What is this Meenakshi? I can share all your problems but I cannot share your blasphemy sins. What are you saying? I am doing all this for you. For us? Then leave the case. Father. Please listen to me Meenakshi.. I couldn't find another way. Have you seen what happened. Imagine what else could happen to him. Meenakshi, As long as I am there, I'll ensure that you are not harmed. Hey! How dare you throw this stone? - Father.. father. - Moksha. - Meenakshi please.. Moksha. - Father.. Father. Who is stubborn? You or me? You did wrong and still arguing. It is for us. why don't you understand me? No one can understand you. And you will not understand anyone. I cant continue this meaningless relationship. Please leave me alone. Please stop boy.. Hello.. where is the house of the lawyer Akbhar Khan. Go straight, and take left. Okay, go. Where is the house of the lawyer Akbhar Khan? Go straight, and take left. Where is the house of the lawyer Akbhar Khan? Oh brother, where is the house of the lawyer Akbhar Khan? Oh.. yeah? Go that way! 'Way to Akbar Khan's house' We got one fifty letters so far from different locations. Fifty phone calls. Madhurai, Kutch, Vishakapatnam, Trivandrum. Everyone is a victim of Act of God. All these cases are rejected by insurance companies on the same ground. Everyone came with a hope that you will fight their case. This is Anwar. Salute. He lost everything in an earthquake. His house, all the money he accumulated for his sisters marriage. Go ahead and lodge a case. Can I go against my religion? Anwar, listen to me. You are not going against anyone. You are asking that person who introduced religion and taught you namaz. You are asking them why God did injustice to you. What about the religious heads? Did any of those religious heads come... ...and help you when you were on roads with your kids? People should be for the religion but not religion for people. Sir... ...my son was a compounder. My daughter in law was a nurse. This is my grandson. They went to a village near Bapatla for a health camp and never returned. They became victims of Tsunami. Me as a mother and this kid as a son, both of us became orphans. Uncle, my grandmother is working to send me to school. Please help me get work in a tea stall. She cannot work any longer. I will have no one else if I loose her. Khan Bhai, how long will take to file all these case. The time it takes to type them. Act of God! Act of God! Act of God! Relax.. Shankar Narayana, Relax. Relax. 700 more are following Gopalrao's footsteps.... ...towards the court against act of God. All the religious heads have received the summons. On the other hand lawyer Shankarnarayana is struggling... ...between the insurance companies and the religious heads. First it was one now it is five hundred crores.. who will pay? However prove that God exists and let him pay for this. Temple, Church or Masjid is irrelevant. Hey Gopalrao, why are you dragging our God apart from yours? I don't know which God is behind which earthquake or Tsunami. You must know it. That is your department. Sir, they are in touch with God round the clock. Let them find out which God has done this. Why would our god do this to his worshippers? Our God loves his children. Allah will never do wrong to the ones who worship him. You mean our God does that? How would I know About your God. - I am talking about the love of Jesus. - Our Allah loves us. You mean that our God doesn't? - How can I say-- - Sir.. your God is only one... - ...but our God has many forms! - Relax! Silence. Please sit down. Your honour! If we start accepting these cases, he will bring in a lakh more tomorrow. I seriously object and request to dismiss and all the cases dismiss immediately. The court will accept if it is a case of a crore... ...but will avoid if it is a hundred crore scam? How can you say that? Did you really complete your law? Please do justice your honor. After considering the arguments, the court accepts to take up all these cases. The court orders all the relevant people in the case not to leave... ...the country till the case is closed. The court is adjourned. Glory to Gopalrao. Glory to Gopalrao. Glory to Gopalrao. Glory to Gopalrao. Glory to Gopalrao. Glory to Gopalrao. Swami. This is Government place. You will be safe here. But outside this? These are the people who will come to you temples, churches and mosques. If they question you there? What will you answer? Religious leaders! Down.. Down! Religious leaders! Down.. Down! Oh my God! Please prove me that God is present! Why to prove? There is God! We go to temples, don't we? All those who believe in God raise your hands. What happened to your hand? Sir, Being a science student I have some technical doubts about God. According to science I doubt that-- Doubt? You have doubt? Why do you have doubt? If I punch you, you will bleed, that is science. But when you see the blood and say 'Oh my God' that is God. This is a case worth five hundred crores. At least four hundred crores to be paid by our company. Will your science come and pay that? Will it? Cool brother. There is a flame burning under me and you say cool? Who else stay with him? Everyone left him sir.. He is alone. Even his house is in mortgage So, there is no one to cry if he dies. But there is none to come and support him. Hello.. Hello. "Gopala.. Gopala! Govinda.. Gopala!" Who is that? Its me, God! No matter who asks this question in this world, I am the answer. If you are Muslim I am Allah... ...if you are Christian I am Jesus... ...since you are Hindu... ...I am Krishna. Oh it is you! You were there when people were after me. Now again when everyone left me. You come in very right time, brother! I don't come in right time time will come after me, as I am God! Brother, you wear suit and claim that you are God. Do you know how God should look like? Look at that. He shouldn't be wearing a shirt, should have a crown, ornaments and weapons etc. Why don't you come in that form so that I believe that you are God. Is that you in that photograph Gopalam? Yes, Its me. But, why are you like this? What do you mean? Where is that garland, that getup? Why don't you come in that form so that I believe it is you. That's a photo taken during my marriage. That is what it is! No one remains the same forever! That was the trend that time, and now this is the latest trend. I think they have not updated my latest pictures on social sites. People are still using the same old pictures. We should change them Gopalam. Listen brother, there is a war going on between me and God. If you keep on saying that you are God... ...I will have to forget your help and send you out of my house. What? You will send me out of my own house? Your house? Here are the documents. You mortgaged this place to Ramji and he sold it to me. How can he do that? I told him that I'll pay him as I get my money. But I have already paid him. How can he when there is still some time? At least he should have told me. Chill Gopalam. Chill. Gopalam. When you get money from the Act of God case... ...give them to me and take back your house. Then why do you have to buy it in the first place. See Otthu, I have a consulting firm. I give advices to people. Advices? I give solutions to all sought of problems. Service open to all. I leave that place once the problem is resolved. I may arrive little late, but I will surely arrive. As I came to help Gopalam now. Help me? I know about your trouble. Court case. Lost your shop and your wife and kids left you. Gopalam, you can stay here but in exchange allow me to use your TV, refrigerator. Is that okay? Sure brother But please don't sell away this house without intimating me. Once I get my money I will buy it back. Tathasthu... I mean, I promise. Thanks brother for permitting me to stay in my own house... ...sorry your house. Guruji, I brought you breakfast. I am not hungry, give it to him. Poor man! Everyone left him alone. There will be no company in such paths. One should walk alone. Lets see how long he can go! Give me that plate. Otthu do you have butter at home. What? Butter.. Butter. For Poori? Yeah! It will be good! Go get it! Sure. "Gopala.. Gopala!" "Gopala.. Gopala! Govinda.. Gopala!" "Gopala.. Gopala!" - "Go.. go.. go.. Gopala!" - "Hi fi Gopala!" "Go.. go.. go.. Gopala!" What a bike? Whose bike is this? I think a guest has visited Gopalrao may be it must be his. Paper! Paper! A sensation created by a common man. Which became a question for god. If this case is resolved. I think he is mad. Yeah! I think so. - Hey what happened? - Don't know. Meenakshi.. why are you playing flute CD so early in the morning stop it! Did she come? Meenakshi.. Meenu. This guy has got some classical touch as well. I don't have any limitations Gopalrao. I can do anything. Master of all arts. Multiple angles. Because-- Where did I keep the documents? You say you are God. Because you are God. Exactly. There are different types of Craziness. My wife was crazy about God and this man thinks that he himself is God. Sir, I am DD reporter. We are just outside your house. Please come out. You came to my house. Mr. Gopalrao.. Please give us one interview. Come out and give us one interview. Listen! I don't want to become a news item in your channel. Leave me alone. - Sir, now you are the hot topic. sir. - Go. I am in neck deep trouble and they want interview. What are you thinking Leeladhar? It is time that you stop all the illegal activities you do in the ashramam. Else from tomorrow no one will donate even a rupee in the name of God. Thank you. Remember Leeladhar. Saffron is not just an attire. It is our culture. Thank you. Swami. If we leave this, that fellow will be made into a hero. The insurance claim is mounting crores. How long do we have to think? Is there anything left to do? I have to go to Bangkok next week for a devotional meeting. Hey Siddeshwara, please come to Bangkok without fail. Swami has come in my dream and insisted that I go that meeting in Bangkok. But here the Judge says that I cant leave this country. Do something sir. What to do? This is not parliament to throw shoes spray pepper and get away. This is court. There is a procedure to follow. Swami I have an idea. it is a bit old, but still it works. Thank you. This is a test from God. He wanted to test whether we will help him... ...in trouble just like he did for us for all these ages. Swami is watching us. What should we do? Shouldn't we secure our God from that crazy fool? Yes or no? Yes, we should. Do we have weapons to safe guard Him? Yes we do.. Peace, Truth and Persistence. Yesterday God appeared in the dream of Siddeswara Maharaj. He directed him on what to do to secure dharma and to punish the wrong. So, for this great.. To lead us from the front... ...this man of eternal knowledge, holy man Shri Siddeswar Maharaj... ...Siddeswar Maharaj will go fasting from now. Siddeswar Maharaj will take a fast unto death! For God, even if death is the only refuge... ...the swami won't have even a drop of water! - Siddeswar Maharaj! - Hail! - Siddeswar Maharaj! - Hail! - Siddeswar Maharaj! - Hail! - Siddeswar Maharaj! - Hail! - Siddeswar Maharaj! - Hail! Sir Siddheswar Maharaj hunger strike has reached third day. All the hindu community and saints are in support from various part of country. Gopalrao rejects to talk to the media. There is no need of water. No need to stop your walk. This is a penance. Under the guidance of Leeladhar Maharaj... ...the fast being undertaken by Swami Siddeshwar Maharaj. We all have to take the responsibility to make this a success. Please join me and say. Hare Krishna.. Hare Krishna.. Krishna Krishna Hare Hare. Hare Krishna.. Hare Krishna.. Krishna Krishna Hare Hare. Hare Rama.. Hare Rama.. Rama Rama Hare Hare. Hare Rama.. Hare Rama.. Rama Rama Hare Hare. Hare Rama.. Hare Rama.. Rama Rama Hare Hare. I cant stop my anger. I will drain you and your kingdom in the sea. Take me along with you that's how you can see Sashirekha. Now you have come to track.. nice. I didn't realize until my wife left me that soiled clothes are so heavy. Hey your so heavy. You said you will drown the kingdom but you are not able to lift me itself. God! Have you seen that? God must be like that. Even a mighty man cannot lift him up and you claim that you are God. You cant estimate weight just by looking, you have lift to know. Want to try? For you my single hand is more than sufficient. If you cant then you should accept that I am God. If I can you should stop claiming that you are God. Done. Will do that. Then I will just lift you away. That is-- Lift me, son! So heavy! Where has he got that power from? What? Oh god what power. Oh my neck. What kind of magic it is? Not like this. Krishna! Would you like to eat butter? You said that I cant lift you? Now, see. I lifted you with single hand. You have demonstrated that intelligence works well than effort. But why are wasting you intelligence? You are restricting a genius in you to come out. You should be using it in occasions. Where? There. Hey Gopalrao. You are a fool, sinner and a dumber. You say that God should compensate for breaking down your shop? But he also gave air for you to breathe. He gave you this body to experience. How much should you pay to Him for that? This is the argument of Gopimaya... ...Send sms as Y you agree and N if you don't. All this is funny for you? Someone who is bad or someone who isn't doing anything is not wrong. Someone like you who is capable of doing but keeping quiet is wrong. Remember. If the efficient refrain, the incompetent will rule. You are right! I will pull them to the roads. These fellows and their God. But, whenever you are angry, why do you drag me? Salutations to the lord! Salutations to Lord Krishna! 'God in the court' Welcome to our special show. God in court! For the last few days everyone's focus is on one person. Some say that he is foolish but some say that he is their leader. This is live He will have trouble. If we are in trouble we go to God. But our today's guest says that God is his trouble. Sir why are you against religion. You media guys target so well. There is nothing about religion here. It is all about my pain and agony. We shouldn't talk about religion here instead we should talk about humanity. You mean to say that there is no God? How can I say that? If you ask me about my father, I can tell you that he is not there. Because he is dead. But I do not know about God. How can I say when I don't know if he is a fact or a fake? They told me.. that God is present and he destroyed my shop. Therefore I am asking them to bring him to me. You are an atheist, why would he come to you? You come on to the road and well teach you. You continue your eating grandma. Didn't you that a case against God is wrong thing to do? What are you suggesting? Should I take law into my hands without resorting to case? If a man does a mistake then a legal action is fine. But cant I do that for God? Do mean to say that humans and God are the same? Why not? Ram was born to Kousalya, Krishna to Devaki and I am born to my mother. They were all born for a reason. May be you were born without a reason. I didn't. Everyone here is born for a reason. Sit down. Why don't you think that some sin in your past life was the cause for your loss? - What is your name? - Sanyasi Rao. Dear Sanyasi Rao, if I give you a tight slap on your face... ...will you accept that the slap is coming back from your past life? Will you? Please sit down Sanyasi Rao, he might as well do that. Who the hell is he? He is not going to let our species to survive. It is like you don't have worth in this life... ...but claim to be super hero in the next life. There is no consistency in what they say. One says that every sin should be answered in this life... ...someone else say that it will come back in the next life... ...and make you a dog or an insect. There is one more They take you to hell. There is a menu card over there. To get burnt in the fire, or to get laid on the thorns or to get fried in oil. What is that? Are we humans or breads? if someone threatens with a knife... ...but these guys threaten us showing devotion. Is this belief or sale? Sir, there is an eternal meaning to everything they say. Do you know what it is? Then why are you following it blindly? Don't believe if some swamiji offers to give holy stones from thin air. Go and ask him to pull out pumpkins. Just use your brain to understand why couldn't he? Please give the next generation some clarity not confusion. - Hey, that's good one. - Yes. Gopalrao knows to play with logic. You are super Gopalrao. I will offer coconut in your name. These guys will never change. I just told them apply brain. They give offers to God. One lakh offer to win a crore rupee cricket betting. Another prays to Gods on his rings before playing his cards. The deeds sins but they need Gods support for that. Oh God please help me get more profits and I will get my head tonsured. Profits to them and hair to God? Is that right? I understand your point son, but that is our tradition and culture. What is wrong in following them. You are right. But let me ask you. Do you have daughters? I have a daughter. - Is she married. - Not yet. Don't feel bad for asking this. When your daughter get married and if by chance her husband dies... ..will you burn your daughter along with him. Sathi Sahagamanam was our tradition. It was considered as part of our dharma. Why don't we follow that? We have to change along with time. What is your definition of ethics? Ethics changes with time. But truth is eternal, it never changes So, what you would say? So you think that we don't need this religions and traditions? I think we are perpetuating religions and religion is killing humans. Either it is making us incompetent or putting a weapon in our hands. One thing is for sure Man can make a stone in God but if God is really there. I would ask him to make every human a human. That is enough. Yes, What ever he said it is truth. I realised that his man is no ordinary on the day I first met. Sir, Do we have insurance for this insurance company? Hats off to you Mr. Gopalrao. You have changed the perspective of God in me and in our audience. Irrespective of the courts verdict... ...the young generation and every generation should think like you. It was an honor to have you on our show. Thank you, thank you very much. One day someone kept a stone in the ground. The next day someone placed a garland and decorated it. Now people are worshiping it as God. This is the only ground in this area. We don't have any other place to go. Tell us if it not possible for the municipality we will contact Mr. Gopalrao. Why do you want to go that far? He will destroy our lives along with that temple. We will take care of this. Look into this. - It was an honor to have you on our show. - Thank you. "Hail Krishna Hari. Hail Krishna Hari." "Hail Krishna Hari. Hail Krishna Hari." "Hail Krishna Hari. Hail Krishna Hari." "Hail Krishna Hari. Hail Krishna Hari." Tell me Siddha! Did Swami come in your dream? Why in dreams swami? I can see him before my eyes. I just came to set up a shoe stand near ashram and now I am made into a Swamiji. Those days were better, at least I could ear prashad. Today I had to eat dates sitting in the toilet. I cant take it anymore swami. Please bail me out. That's not fair Siddha. Devotees will start disbelieving you. Where are the damn devotees? Three mice set guys, four tent hirers. If I get up they too will get up and leave. I used to eat a fruit every five minutes. Now I am dying out of hunger. How can you reach your goal if you lose patience in such crucial moments? Bear with it. I am least bothered about myself. All I am worried about is you. Today it is me. Tomorrow it will reach you! Swami, I don't want this watch, I want a laptop. For those who can build castles in air that shouldn't be a problem. Give me laptop. "Hail Krishna Hari. Hail Krishna Hari." "He has come. the son of Nanda has come." "Watch him everyone for he will do some miracle." "He has come. the son of Nanda has come." "His one whistle will launch the celebrations." "Don't stay away hiding today." "You have to join us and dance today." "This world is a holy temple for you. We expect a lot of good from you." "Why anyone else? This is your land. All the good you do will raise you high." "Play the Dhol.. Play the Dhol." "Play the Dhol.. Play the Dhol." "The one who yields to women how can he resolve pain?" "He yielded for love and thus will swear on life to save." "The one who raised calf how can he guide you?" "He rode the chariot in the war and thus the righteous won." - "He is black in colour." - "But has pure heart." - "He is known for naughtiness." - "But is close to all of us." "As long as this craziness remains in you." "He will be one among all of you." "Play the Dhol.. Play the Dhol." "The colors are being showered." "Play the Dhol.. Play the Dhol." "Play the Dhol.. Play the Dhol." "Play the Dhol.. Play the Dhol." "Play the Dhol.. Play the Dhol." Here. This is the house of my wife. This is your father in law house, your house is your wife's house. Whatever. Moksha.. Moksha. Louder Gopalam. They will not open if they know that it is me. This is not the way. It is so high! This is not possible for me alone, come here brother. Tell me friend. I need your help Support me with your hand and I will jump across the wall. Hold your hand brother. Salutations to Lord Krishna! That's it.. Oh my! How did you come? Same as you did. That's fine. I'll go inside and come. Stay here. Okay. Dad. Mother said that Sai baba would come if his name is written million times. Why did you come? Meenkshi. You are still angry on me? Blame me.. Kick me if you want. I was told that Bhagavadgita also says that there is no harm kicking husband. Where? Here. Hello. Why did you come? To help you. He is God, the owner of our house. He gave me shelter in my own house. I heard about it. So I leave. I am asking you to come but you are leaving? Think about our son. Then take back the case for him at least. She is still the same. Lets go. What is this? You are fasting? Fasting for God is not staying hungry it is staying closer to God. But you are staying away from your God. If you cannot close to your God then how can you be close to that God? Don't think that your husband is back stabbing God, he is just question him. Think about it. The case of God vs Man is gaining interest day by day. The ideologies of Gopalrao are showing strong influence on the society. But will the court get influenced is the question. Let's wait and see to find out what new turns this case... ...would take in today's argument. Mr. Siddayya.. heard that you are on hunger strike? Is that over? The fast until death? God appeared in my dream the other day and said Siddha enough of fasting. So I had to stop, not because of hunger. Next time when you God comes in your dream please ask him to come in mine too! I need to talk to him. Quite please.. Quite. Hey you idiot! You fool! We have established an ashram and constructed six hundred temples. We are pious people safe guarding the virtues of the world. Hence he will appear before us and talk to us. Oh then you have opened a shopping mall for him. You are really safe guarding the virtues. Including the three hundred small temples about... ...fifteen hundred priests are getting their livelihood, you know. Then do you know how many hundreds of beggars... ...live around those six hundred temples? But sir, don't ever let them inside... ...whether it is hot sun or rainy day. Let them live their life on the stairs. Who told you this? Even a small kid would know that. Sir, I know a priest who is working in one of their temples. He asked me to come with a tumbler of milk to Shiva's temple... ...if I am keen to win this case. When I asked him why, he said I would know if I go. I went there and found a long queue. Everyone was carrying milk and calling out Shiva Shiva. I thought there would be someone inside drinking the milk. But it was only a Shivling. All this milk is being poured on that stone. Sir, do you know where all this milk is going to? I expected someone there, but none. They are all getting into a drainage. Total waste! A beggar was standing beside that drain. May be he was hungry for some days. Even if he wanted to drink that milk, he couldn't take it from the drainage. I gave him the milk I was carrying. He drank and said that God will bless me. Who else can be called God? Sir, do you believe in God? I am God. I see, then I am Pawan Kalyan. Oh nice to meet you. Moulvi saab, the blankets that you spread in dargah... ...could be given to a shivering fakir. Allah will be happy. The candles that you light up in a church, put them in a poor man's house. Jesus will bless you father. Tell me one thing Maharaj. God will be concerned about all those devotees.... ...who pray to him with pure heart. Isn't it? Yes. Then why do the buses bound to Amarnath and Vaishnodevi land up in the valleys? They all were sincerely praying to him. Did He pull them directly to Him? Show me one vehicle that met with an accident... ...and doesn't have an image of God inside it. I object you honor. He is trying to fool us with his words. Sir, what i say-- Mister Gopalrao this is not a discussion about good and bad. This is court and court needs evidence. You were saying that this is act of God. We will not support the conditions of the insurance company. If they say it is act of judge, we cannot ask the judge to pay the money. These are all allegations not evidences. Even if the policy bears Gods name why should God pay the compensation? If you think that God has to pay the money they you have to prove that... ...God has destroyed your shop. A written documented proof like this.. understand? Mister Gopalrao Court will only value proofs and witnesses. It can't consider emotions. Do you have any proofs with you? No.. No sir. Court is giving a week days time as a last chance. If you fail to produce the proofs... ..all these cases along with yours will be dismissed. The court is adjourned. Thank you. Next time if you appear again in this court, I will strip you off your clothes. Relax. Many people are having hope in you. How will you answer them? There are hundreds who depend on you.. Tell us what will you do? Where will you get the evidence from? The entire nation is focusing on you. Don't worry, son. Mother! That is okay son. God will give justice. He will come down. Oh! You have come back to square one! You can't play blind folded there are snakes in this game. Hey friend! Would like to play a game? A game with God. Are you afraid of losing? What wrong did that old woman do? God? What do you know about God? How can we call a person God when he playing with lives of people? I don't believe in God and that is fine... ...but what wrong did those seven hundred people do? That old woman still believes in God. Cheater your God is a cheater He made his brother in law kill all his relatives in Mahabharata... ...and in the Bharat he is making so many people suffer. This is Dharma. And Dharma is like that. It was in a packed court of Kings, ministers... ...and so called elders of Kourava kingdom... ...a women was stripped and none of them objected. All those who refrained from stopping that have to die... ...even if he is Bhishma. Ashwathama was only one who objected and questioned. So, he is spared. This is Dharma. This Earth has bear. But anyone on this Earth with no responsibility has to perish. That is Dharma. But why are you blaming God when you did mistake? Do you know from where the tears of all these people are originating? It is from you. It is originating from the belief they have in you. Leader is not just to make believe people, but the one who leads them. He not the one who wins, but makes others win. Wars are not won with fervor it also requires intelligence. This is Bhagavadgita. I know that you don't believe in this. But believe me. For every question that originates on this Earth, the solution is in this book. This will change you. You will find a path. "Should I believe that I created you as God." "Or that you have sculpted me as God." "What do you think it is a fact or fake? Which way would your thoughts go?" "If the question is yours and only yours." "The answer would also emerge from you." Please give some alms in the name of Allah. Stop begging and try to work. Allah will bless you. "My smile is the light of life in your body." "The sound of flute from my lips is the beat of your heart." "Only if you have the ability to realize." "If you remove the curtains then glow will come." "If the dream is yours and only yours." "Oh Protector! Oh Protector!" - "Oh Protector! O Protector!" - "Oh God!" - "Oh Protector! O Protector!" - "Oh God!" "Oh Protector! Oh Protector!" "In the quest you run all around. Will you be able to find yourself?" "Oh God." "In the heart that is melted in mercy. Can't you find yourself?" "Oh God." "In search you grope all the sky. But will you be able to touch yourself?" "Oh God." "The hand that is stretched to spread friendship. Will touch itself as God." "If the virtue is yours and only yours." Sir. Sir. Shoe polish sir! No. Sir, it is me. You told me to work hard and Allah will bless me! Is it you! Okay do it. Show me your hand, take this. Today is the day of final battle between man and God. Who will be the winner will be known very soon. Sir today is the final hearing. Who do you think will win? This case was over last time. This is just a formality. But judgment is not over yet. He already lose the case. We have to wait and see. Keep watching. Man or God? Mr. Gopalrao, are you producing any proofs? I need someone who is genius to answer the question I am going to ask. If there is anyone in them, request them to come into the witness box. I have asked for a genius you please sit down. Swami. Do you think that all the religious discourses given by you sages is true? Absolutely. - Are they written anywhere? - In Bhagavadgita. Do you believe in Gita? It says those who disbelieve will be destroyed. He will not have peace here on earth and in the other world as well... ...this from the fourth chapter, fortieth verse. Oh! What is the meaning of it? It says those who disbelieve will be destroyed. He will not have peace here on earth and in the other world as well. Did you understand? This man is an interesting character. Siddhayya, do you really know all that written in Gita... ...or you just repeat whatever he says. Sir, he is like school children who never remembers the morning prayers... ...but closes eye and just roll the tongue. They roll tongue and he rolls his hand. Silence. Gopalrao! You sinner! Fool! You are insulting a holy sage. You will not find please in hell also. How can you be so sure? Did you also open ashrams there? Silence. Silence. How dare you insult me? Relax, relax no. - You are a sinner. - Hey, swami.. leave me. Silence! - That is what you are. - Silence! - How dare you insult me? - What's this? - Don't spare him, teacher! - How dare you insult our teacher! - I will see your end! - Order.. Order I say! Please be seated. Pleas calm down, swami. Please sit down. A man who remains equanimous in joy, despair, calmness and anger... ...one who remains equanimous in all states and emotions is called a sage. This is from the second chapter, fifty sixth verse. A man who remains the same in happiness and sadness... ...the man who can overcome anger... ...and wants and the man who can see God in every creature is called a sage. These people teach us Bhagavadgita? I just said two words against him and he is coming onto me. Is this your Siddhi Siddheswar? This issue is not about Siddheswars sagehood. We need proof that God has demolished your shop. Proofs. Proofs. Relax. Relax. Swamiji tell one thing. Did God deliver Bhagavadgita? Yes So all that in that book is true? Every letter of it. Please note that your honor. All the five elements originate from me. I cause the origin and end of Creation. Have you heard about this? Lord told this in Bhagavadgita seventh chapter, under vignana yogam. I teach Bhagavadgita and you cannot put me in pain asking if I know it. I don't gain anything by giving you pain. But the court wants to hear you explain this. All the five elements originate from me. I cause the origin and end of Creation. You? No. God. Oh! Please note this as well your honor. In connection to this case Gita contains his statement clearly. I am the root, the mover and address of this Creation. Ninth chapter, eighteenth verse. It means that He is the root, the mover and address of this Creation. I am the foundation and I am the destruction. I create and I destroy. This is what God himself admitted clearly. This is the documented proof you have asked for. I object your honor. He is just reciting verses from the Gita and claiming them to be proofs. It can't be that way. Does it bear Srikrishna's signature on the book? You are not believing in the book that is used to take oath in the court. - Objection, your honour! - Objection over ruled. It is also told in Quran sir. Meaning Lord Allah is the one who runs this world. This is true. Anything that happens on Earth is God's deed. Bible also has a similar statement. Isaiah chapter 54, verse 16. I who created I have also created the ravager to destroy. Sir, all these mean the same. My shop was destroyed because of God. This is an act of God. God has to compensate to all those who are suffering because of him. God have to pay. Order. Please sit down. If not him, his collection agents have to pay. I have given you proofs as you required. Now you have to do the justice. Objection your honor. He is trying to move the case in to wrong track. Objection your honor. What is your objection? Let him tell. If God's existence is proven, we don't have to pay anything. Relax, relax. What are saying? Are you trying to put everything on our head? Just keep quiet! Oh my God! Where are you? Virtues are at stake here. Injustice is prevailing. - Your honor client is to make. - Come. Descend from heaven to this earth, come. Whats happening here? - Come and possess me.. come.. possess me. - Swami.. relax. - Order. Order. - Quiet.. everybody sit down. - Quiet.. this is a court! - You wait Swami. - Swamiji, please sit down! - Quiet, everybody.. sit down! Oh lord! Sita.. Rama! Lord, give me enough strength to kill this man and atone for the sin! Thank you.. I am sure the judgment will be in our favor. - Gopalrao.. what happened? - Gopalrao! - Brother.. Gopalrao! - Boss! C'mon! C'mon! Let it come.. hurry up! Give way! The man who was representing many victims and was fighting for justice. Gopalrao was attacked in the court room by an unidentified person. Today is a black day to the justice system. Please madam! You cannot go inside. I am his wife. No madam, Please consult to the doctor. Don't you understand? I am his wife. How is he? He is in critical condition. He is in coma due to excess loss of blood. His fight is not against the God. It is against the methods we follow. It is against the ignorance of converting a stone into God. It appears to me as if he was sent by God to show this human race... ...a path of righteousness. Gopalrao is a saint. He is a messenger of God. Thank you. Why not make those words a reality? Bhagavan Gopalrao Baba. Didn't understand? If he becomes God, devotion will survive... ...we make him a God, that devotion will stay at our disposal. But why will he accept this? He should be first alive to accept. He will join the Gods and Gods will join with us. The religious sages recognized Gopalrao as a saint... ...and decided to pay five hundred crores of compensation... ...to the victims of the Act of God. He is on ventilator. Trust in god. Friend! Wake up! Oh is that you brother? How are my wife and kids? What was the courts verdict? I am sure I won brother. It is ok even if I die now! Even when you are close to death you are keeping your confidence alive. That's what I like friend. Honesty should have that amount of pride. That's fine Gopalam... ...but when I came to you, why are you saying that you want to come to me? What do you have to do there? Only God can be funny to someone who is dying. You are God. Gopalrao is leaving and you are by side in the end. Thank you very much brother. Nothing happened to you Gopalam. Check for yourself. Some think I don't exist and some other think that I exist. But you questioned me about my existence. Come. You are-- I have appeared as I am on a calendar and on google wall paper... ...and you still don't believe? So you were behind all this play and act. Did you lead me and taught me to win? I have stepped on your hands! That was a sin. You are my friend Gopalam. You are my real devotee. Me and a devotee? I am number one atheist Krishna! I never believed you. I haven't ever prayed to you. You never prayed but you fed me when I was hungry. I fed you? You did Gopalam. You have seen an old mans hunger in the food that is getting drained. The other day you have helped a Muslim near your shop. I am in that old man and I am in that Muslim. I am also there inside all those for whom you stood for. I never believed that you would respond to peoples call. Had I known that you would come even if we don't call you... ...I would have never said so many words against you Gopalam, those people see me in stones and crosses. They stopped finding me in humans. Only you did and that is why I am here. I couldn't understand your miracles. No. I did miracle because I am Krishna. I haven't become Krishna because I do miracles. But people believe in me because of those miracles. But I am omnipresent. I am there in every atom in this large universe. Then why did you create these religions and temples? No, I have only created humans... ...and I have given them wisdom. I have given them freedom. Freedom that allows one to lie to mother when one is a small kid. Freedom to make small mistakes when in love. Freedom to identify good from bad and to experience forgiveness. It is because of this freedom humans are humans. Otherwise they would have become robots. Robots. But humans are using that... ...freedom for selfish reasons. Caste, religion, region all reasons to fight with one another. How lame? You were in coma for a month now. See for yourself what happened during this time. Doctors are saying Gopalrao is in critical condition. The entire country in now discussing if Gopalrao was actually a God. What is this? Watch for yourself. The religious sages recognized Gopalrao as a saint... ...and decided to pay fifty billion as compensation to the victims of Act of God. The Lord told me to personally hand over the money to the victims and we did that. Who told you that he is God? Is it possible for anybody to know the exact time of their death? Gopalrao told me that he would leave his body on Vijayadashami. Bhagavan Sai baba also left this world on the same day. "Gopalrao baba.. Gopalrao Baba." "Gopalrao baba.. Gopalrao Baba." Otthu? He is kind-hearted! There is a vacant bed beside Gopalrao, do you want me to reserve that for you? "Gopalrao baba.. Gopalrao Baba." If we just start four rumors about Gopalrao... ...people will make them into forty stories. I was taking a nap during duty last night. Someone slapped me and I woke up! I heard the voice of Gopalrao baba saying that sleeping while on duty is wrong. And then he appeared before me. Ten feet, hundred thousand feet. I am so blessed. Gopalrao baba is God. My boss came to my dream and told me that he is the 11th incarnation of Lord Vishnu. I have seen Gopalrao Baba flying in the air on his scooter. The scooter suddenly stopped midair. I thought the fuel was over. As I kept watching, the God vanished into thin air. Gopalrao bhai is Gods angel. Yes he is god. On Vijayadashami the ventilator will be switched off, Gopalrao's story shall end. But Swamiji, I have spent a lot this time. Five hundred crores to the insurance company... ...one crore for doctor, and the extra cost of building his temple. You spend so much to loot people, cant you spend this much for looting God? It is all one time investment Rayudu. It can be recovered in one year. It has been long time a new God came up in the market. People crowded to have one glimpse of Gopalrao baba. They want to see the holy grave and the life size statue of Gopalrao. - My statue with ornaments? - See how grand it looks! Leeladhar baba is personally supervising the construction of... ...Gopalrao Babas holy grave. What is all this Krishna? You ruined their business so they made you their business. They are building temples for you and hope to make fifty billion in an year. Then why are you not stopping them? If I wanted, the Kurukshetra war wouldn't happen. but I only stand by dharma. The war is yours. Decision is yours. Remember freedom? We too were here while God was alive. We spoke and fought with him. We inhaled the air that he did. All this is a blessing from our last life - Gopalrao Baba. - Hail! - Gopalrao Baba. - Hail! - Gopalrao Baba. - Hail! Does god need hospital? Not required! Will God ever have death? No. All this is his miracle. Mukunda.. Murari! Govinda.. Gopala! Giver of joy! - Gopalrao Baba. - Hail! - Is he dead? - He has gone missing! What happened? What can I say.. He is not there. Can't be traced even in CCTV cameras! That shouldn't happen, Siddha! How do you speak crap dressed like a saint? If he comes here, he will bury us alive! - Gopalrao Baba. - Hail! - Gopalrao Baba. - Hail! Why doesn't the man understand what I said? Why are you laughing? Looking at these people I have feel that I will recover my costs in six months. He is alive, sir. I know he is alive in the hearts of these people. He is there in this air and he will be there in our profits tomorrow. - Gopalrao Baba. - Hail! All out. Go. Won't you come. Aren't you enough? Gopalrao... ...if you believe your determination, the entire world will support you. Go. Go man. - Where should I go? - Old habits! - Go! - No other option? Your victory is not here, but there-- Go. - Gopalrao Baba. - Hail! - Gopalrao Baba. - Hail! Hello. What? He escaped? What were you doing? Idiots! Gopalrao is alive! Brainless fellow! That is what I have been shouting all along. When I tried to tell him.. he just chants the baba's name. And you kept saying that he's in the air and dust! What will happen to my five hundred crores? Swamiji will bring it back with a magical wave of hand.. go and take. - Gopalrao Baba. - Hail! - Gopalrao Baba. - Hail! - Gopalrao Baba. - Hail! - Gopalrao Baba. - Hail! Guruji, I am glad that nothing happened to you. I know everything. Why did you stop? Continue chanting my name! Hail Gopalrao Baba! I am the new God that you invented. Hail Gopalrao Baba. How can you believe whatever they say? You have made me God and started your business. Hail Gopalrao Baba. My friend told me. If you strongly wish to see God you can see him. You can see him other humans.. but only in them and not in these stone idols. From now on, don't go to their ashrams or give them donations for their grace! That would be the biggest punishment for them. - Don't leave them. - Yes, yes. They have cheated us. We should not spare them. Kill each of them. Yes, yes. Stop. Stop. Don't get carried away. Listen to me. Move aside. What do you get if you kill them? If not they someone else will come up. Do you know what is creating them? Your weakness. It is thriving in your heads like a ten headed demon. If you burn that demon, everyday is a Vijaya Dashami. Leave them. Go away! Oh god. Gopalrao.. devotion is an addiction. Once habituated, it is hard to get rid of it! The people you are seeing here are not God loving people... ...they are God fearing people. They don't have devotion towards God but fear. If not today some other day they will be seen in our Ashram. May you not have fear! I am not angry about you. Your belief is good but it wasn't placed in right things. Krishna. All went as you wished, friend. Hello. Come. Krishna.. Krishna. Whom are you searching for friend? I told you that I am omnipresent, exist in everyone and observe you from within. Gopalam, what do you want to do with that key chain? Will you make it a talisman? Be yourself Gopalrao! - Whom are you talking to? - Daddy.. daddy. With your Krishna. Where? Here. Uncle. Son-in-law is fine.. It's good. By the way, why did the goons run away after seeing me? Oh! I appeared to them like that! Vasudeva Gopalakrishna from Gokul. Signing off.. Will meet you soon, friend. "Go.. go.. Gopala!" "Go.. go.. Gopala!" "Nandlala.. Oh Nandlala!" "Nandlala.. Oh Nandlala!" "Nandlala.. Oh Nandlala!" "Nandlala.. Oh Nandlala!" "Gopala.. Gopala!" "Govinda.. Gopala!" "Gopala.. Gopala! Govinda.. Gopala!" "Gopala.. Gopala!" "Gopala.. Gopala!" "Gopala.. Gopala!"
