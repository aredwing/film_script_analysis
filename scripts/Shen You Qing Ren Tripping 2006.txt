Xiang Xi style of transporting corpse, it is a kind of Taoist's practice to lead dead people home after their death so that they could be buried with a whole body in their home town. Tripping... Yuko, don't forget me when you're back to Japan. You must always call me. Don't forget sending me pictures. And, Skype and MSN too. I miss you. Bye. Ming. Put these herbs into the cabinet. Dad. Yuko, Kenji, and Kohei... Their parents brought them back to Japan, But why not me? Butterfly. You used a wrong word. They're not going back. You grew up in Taiwan. So you can't use the word back. We are Japanese, but why should we stay in Taiwan? This is not stipulated. Why can't Japanese have their homes in Taiwan? Dad. You're still young, so you want to go around. Be frank, you're kinda playful. When you fall in love in Taiwan, When you get married and have your own family, you'll get stable. I just don't want it. I will never get married in Taiwan. Butterfly... Your mom and I have a dream. We want to run a shop selling Chinese herbs and learn Chinese medicines in Taiwan. Your mom died after your birth. I'll never forget her words before her death... You must keep up with our will of saving people with herbs. Dad Dad, come on! Why do you always talk about mom... Whenever I mention the matter of going back to Japan? Actually, you lied. Mom was not possible to say such stupid things before death. Butterfly. Go upstairs and read. Your teacher Lin said you must study more Geography. You don't seem understand very well about Taiwan. I want to move out. Butterfly. Please send this to Mr. Li's home at the 26th Lane.

He's so disgusting. Let's go. Where are you going? Come home earlier. Let's go. It sucks! Butterfly. Why do you hit so hardly? You just didn't hit hard. No more game? No more. Butterfly, it's late now. Don't you worry that your dad would scold you for that? I am not going home. Did you declare war to your dad? Forget about him. I just do what I want. Who cares! Let's go for an adventure, okay? So? Are you scared? No admission. Filming venue, for contact, please go to the office. If filming is taken inside, we would be kicked out. No one is filming now.

I just lost my way. Are you filming? What movie is it? Who is the lead? I am sorry. Uncle, from here to the car park, Which direction should I go? Do you think they're alike? Yes, possible. She definitely is. Lady... Are you the heroine Green-wine? Green-wine? No, don't kid me. I just passed by. We know you always keep your incognito She denies, but it means yes. We hope you'd help us.

Heroine, come in, you take first. What? Thank you. Hold it. Get lost. Open the bag. When will the filming end? I want to go home. I am sorry. Go home? My dad is waiting for me.

If you want the filming to go on, go ahead. Well, who can tell me... How to get to the door? Don't come close to me. I don't care which film making company employed you. If you come closer, I won't give you face. You theft! I won't let you go. Are you mentally handicapped? I am not a heroine, I am not an actress. Cut! Cut! What's wrong with you guys? Hai-sheng, why are you watching Green-wine again? It's time to eat. Today is July one, we eat vegetables. After the meal, we'd better burn some incense. Just to avoid meeting ghosts. It's time to eat now. Doggie. It's already July one, better move fast. Even we can escape, it's still a long way to go home. If we miss the Mid-autumn festival, we can't change the official silver to currency. So, how can the village people solve the problem? Hai-sheng. It's fixed. The gate of hell opens, we have to go out now. Hurry up! Come and help! Someone escaped. Hai-sheng, go! What? Escape from this hole for dogs? So., what do you want? You want to go out through the main gate? I, Hai-sheng Yik is a virile man Search every inch of this place for me. Hurry up. Doggie. Wait for me. Three ghosts tried to disturb your home. They affect the magnetic field, so you don't feel good. It's okay, I'll remove them. Then, everything will go normal again. Bravo! Master Crane, thank you. Have you prepared the money you promised to pay? After the exorcism, we have to transport the corpses back to Xiangnan tomorrow. We are ready. Okay, I'll make the exorcism after receiving money. Revert evil to good deeds. Whoever stops me from making money, whoever will be killed. Listen to my order! My order to the ghosts! Go! What's the matter? Why are there ghosts? End! End! Ray. Xiao-zhi. Remove all sorts of evils and keep family safe. Sir, you can feel ease now. What are you filming here? Thank you, master. Greed for money. Still one more. One more? Excuse me. I am sorry. How can I get to the car park? This is the last one. If there is one more, I must want more money. Listen to my order. Go. Go! This evil spirit is more powerful than I expected. Thunder charm! Uncle, you're great! I know you're filming. Can you tell me how to get to the door? Break! Back to where you belong. Evil spirits, go back to your place. What's wrong? You guys are... Why don't you listen everything first? Who can tell me now? Where is the front door? Or... Disgusting! You maniac! Come here! This is the fox goblin. But that is not my specialty. I won't pay if the exorcism is not finished. I am ill-fated! I have to transport the corpses. You are nonsense! Can you make yourself clear? What's wrong with you? Where are you going? Break! Stay where you are! You old bluffer! Give me my clothes! Stop! Stop! No way! This is not working! How dare you spit! Stop! Or, I'll call the police. Master, save me! Stop! Sure I can get you! This is working! Butterfly! Ming, bring me musk, borneol and calamus. Yes sir. Hurry up. Yes. Butterfly. Butterfly. Ming, bring her home. Yes. I think this is the place. Yes. Get it out, hurry up. Hai-sheng, I think it's over there. Right? Yes. Go! Dead bodies! You don't have to tell me. We can go now, we got the money now. Hai-sheng, wait... What's wrong, let's go. Wait, do you want to have a look... We would be scared after watching dead bodies, right? Those soldiers would be cared too. Right? So? Do we look like dead bodies? Let's go in and take a look. Okay. It's strange! Green-wine always comes alone. Why did she rob with some rascals? Maybe they need money badly. This home for the dead seems to be haunted. That's right. What is it? What? Don't take any glance, they're just dead bodies. Dead bodies! Let's go! The officer asked me to arrest Green-wine, that's nonsense. It's sort of looking for troubles! So we can take a good sleep now. I am exhausted. Don't move. I am not moving. Hai-sheng, these two dead people can move. Stop playing, let's go. Have a sneeze! Okay. Make a sneeze! Hurry up, make a sneeze! Hurry up! Help! I told you to sneeze! But I can't. Hurry up! Listen to my order! Don't move. Why do you come here for? Do you want trouble? Doggie, are you okay? Come back! Don't touch him. He is poisoned by dead bodies. He will become one of them later. Taoist, what can we do? Are you virgin? Me? Don't feel embarrassing, tell me now. I don't have great hope. I am... But I am a bit sick. I just can't get a good chance. Don't do anything not decent. I got it... All right, piss on his face now. What? You mean... Yes, hurry up. Since he is weakest now. Piss on his face now. I can't help... I don't want it. Actually I am fine. Don't listen to him, piss now. If he is poisoned all over his body, more urine will be useless. Hurry up. Doggie, this is for your own good. Wait. Will he bite? Don't worry, just piss... I don't want it... I am sorry. Our hometown is always flooded. The officials make big money from detaining the food for beneficial purpose. We have got no choice... but to rob. We stole the money from corrupted officials. Before August 15, we must change the money to currency. Then we will buy food and medicines for the people in need. Therefore we... We then joke with the two corpses. I dare not do that again. Taoist, please forgive us. You're scared. I am fine, I am not afraid. We scared them. Don't scare us, okay? Well, You guys keep on pretending as corpses. I'll transport you back to your hometown. Maybe, you can escape from the government check. Thank you for your help. Have you brought other money? Just official silver. When you change to currency, Give me 10% . Okay. Damn it, Maniac, where are you going? She just obsesses us. Bitch, I tell you, it's over now. Don't blame me of not warning you God is merciless! What did you say? You drag me like this. And you tell me that God is merciless? Wait. She is not evil spirit. I guess, She is the famous heroine Green-wine. She robs the rich and helps the poor. I told you many times, I am not Green-wine. You don't get that? My name is Butterfly. Green-wine always lives in seclusion. You robbed the bank with your fellows lately, right? Why are you here? What a shame! I want to rob the rich to save the poor, but I was caught, and I just escaped. Is he Ming? What's the matter? Search! Yes. Sir, we discovered a clothe... So long so far, we want to go home fast. Rise, hurry up! Go, go back, and hurry up. Wait for me. Xiangzi style of transporting corpses started in ancient time. They help the dead people to keep a full body. And help the dead to go back to their hometown. Then, they'll be buried and rest in peace. I must be dreaming. To transport dead bodies, we must fulfill two conditions. One, be bold. Second, be strong. Before greeting me as your master, I must try you guys. I know how bold you are. But are you strong enough? I have doubts. We just follow you temporary. Don't think that we are trying to learn from you. I am afraid... You'd faint me... Tell me where is East. Don't think, tell me at once. Why do you ask? This is East. You're really something. When you transport the corpses... and get exhausted, then you won't lose your way. Master, I won't wrong the direction. I have a compass. Okay, after these two cups of tea, I'd officially become your master. Get up... Thank you, master. Doggie. All right. All right. Thank you, master. Wash the dirty clothes. You... Doggie. And this one too. Doggie. Let's go together. Am I dreaming? How to wake up? Am I in ancient time? If you want a slap, I'll help you. This one doesn't seem to be a modern people. And neither ghost. Do you think she is from... Master... I heard people transporting corpses at night. How can we do it in day time? Those Taoists say so. They said, when the dead people shine under the sun, the negative energy will disperse. Actually, he hates hot weather. It has nothing to do with power. He just bluffs. Actually, the Taoist won't mind day time or night time. Even it is noon time, just use the Five-element nail... to nail into the body of the walking corpse, then the corpse can still move. Bravo! Master Crane. Don't just teach them how to transport a corpse. Help me to think a way home. I am thinking, too. But... Your family isn't found in this age. Oh my God! I think so. How do you come here? Who knows? I played hide and seek with my friends. That's why I came here. Suddenly I came here. This is so strange! Hurry up. Go... Hurry up... Move... Transporting corpses in day time... Oh, dirty energy. Extract this herb for some juice. And then mix with these two, this is the best medicine to cure your back pain. It's well mixed. Hai-sheng. Yes. Put some on her shank. Yes, master. It's okay, let me fix it myself. It's okay. It'll be quick. Here comes the boat. Wearing armor and gold helmet, listen to my order. Five thunders, step by step. Hurry up, move. Listen to my order. I'd like to ask one thing. Go ahead. What do you think about me? You'd not bad. So, can you tell me... What's your next move? I just want to go home earlier. Lady Green-wine, excuse me. I want to tell you once more time. I am not a heroine. And I won't rob the rich to save the poor. Get up. One two three four five six seven eight two two three four five six seven eight three two three four five six seven eight four two three four five six Look this way. Elbow of the right, elbow on the left. Six two three four five six seven eight seven two three four five six seven eight eight two three four five six seven eight Stop! You want to exhaust them? Ong Ma Hung! Give it to me! Why do you carry note? Don't you think it's a trouble? I won't trust the old man. He needs us to pay, but he doesn't take good care of us. Why didn't he bring water here? I won't think too much now. Most important is... bring the note to home town to save people. And the rest... What's up? It's okay. Sorry. Why do you mask me? Miss Butterfly, I am sorry. Butterfly is bathing. No. Doggie and I came to get water. I don't know Butterfly is... I am so sorry... I am in the water, you did see nothing. You don't have to be this shy. She said we saw nothing! So, let's go down and take a bath too. Behave yourself! She's gone. I am sorry. Oh no, I want to drink! I don't shit well, you know? Let's go out for a drink. So much! So much... you don't mind spending a little for wine, do you? Where are you going? Just then... What did you take out from Hai-sheng's bag? This one? In our hometown Xiangnan, we call this... Toilet paper. This is for cleaning ass. Go sleeping, I am going to shit. I don't think so. You took Hai-sheng's note, right? Tell me. Hai-sheng... Shut up! I told you not to cry out. Listen to me. I talked to Hai-sheng. If I help him to disguise as dead body and reach home, he will pay me 10/% of the money for salary. So, this note... Do you think it is mine? So, where do you take this note to? Go to sleep. I am now going to drink some wine. To the town? I'll go with you. Waiter. You just told me that there is a place for wine. Cross this lane and you'll see a bridge. Cross the bridge, and you'll see a club named "Drunken Moon". That's the place. Got you. Take your time. Boss, the Taoist went to Drunken Moon. This is government note. Just the same. Bravo! It's funny! Just like dreaming. Bravo. You're a wine bibber. Wine bibber? Bravo! This is like a big road. I thought you've fallen into the river. I did it intentionally. I am... A powerful Taoist. If it is true, Show me now. Bring me home now. Home? It's difficult. Why? Unless. Someone knows how the stance of entering time tunnel. And he must match with me at the same time. If not, you can never go home. How can it be possible? Who knows it? So, go back to sleep. Master, did you take my note? What's up? What's up? I am your master. I just take one for buying some wine. You're too mean. Master, I will pay you. But the government money is registered. If this goes to the market, the soldiers can easily trace us and kill us. That's right. It's not possible. That's just a note, who cares? Not possible. Possible. Not possible. Possible. No. Yes. No. Yes. It should be, 50- 50. Don't panic. It's okay. Rise. Doggie, bring the fat one and tall one away first. Don't let any of them lose the way. Go. What's up? Go. Please obey order, okay? Butterfly, run! Stop! Go! To hell with you! To hell with you! Why do you look at me in this way? I am sorry, Hai-sheng. Save it. I don't know why you disguise as Green-wine, and want to go with us. Wait! I have never told you I'm the heroine. So, why do you follow us? I just... I think you're nice guy, so I stay with you. I can't imagine it'd become this! I know no one here, and I... I really don't know how to go home. Master caused everything, we... Get lost, I don't want to see you! Why do you scold her? I took the money for drinking wine. Just scold me. I think, Doggie and I have to leave by ourselves. I don't want to ruin our plan. See you. Doggie. Let's go. Yes? Where are the government notes? They're gone. We must have dumped them on the way. Let's go back. Okay. Wait. The government must have taken them back. So, let's seize them back in the government office. Good idea. No hurry, let me think something. We have no time to wait. I got it. I think I must sacrifice these two treasures. Fix. Guard well or not? Everything is fixed. If those two criminals come, they won't be able to escape. Tell everyone to be full alert. Once they hear the bell rings, And see any strangers here, kill with no mercy. Got it, sir. When dawn comes, we must take these two boxes of government notes... to the courtier. Now, I want you to remote control the corpses Make it act together with you. And make them bring back the money back. Yes, master. Good. Set up. Heaven and hell. Good time and place. Transform our bodies. Change the souls. Go. Jump. The essence of the world, Listen to my order. Super vision. The boxes of money are surrounded by red thread, Master, I'll get it. Calm down first. If I am right, the thread can stop thieves and ghosts. What'd we do? No hurry up. Listen to my order. Flying insect stance! I can't get it. Listen to my order! Super vision! Butterfly? Dead bodies back to base. Who are you? Stop. Stop! Buddies, you're back. You're safe! Thank you. What's wrong with Butterfly? She stole the money, she'd be in danger. Oh no! Let's leave this place first. Welcome home. Go. How dare you stir it up? Return the money! If you dare to rob the money, at least tell us your name. I know robbing government's money is a big crime. But to save to people in my hometown, I hope you to grant a helping hand. After that, I promise, you can take my life any time. Is that the heroine Green-wine? Fix. Are you transporting corpses? Yes. What's up? This damn Taoist dares to challenge us. No... It's a misunderstanding, we are common people only. We are hurrying to transport the walking corpses to Xiangnan. Their families are long waiting. The fog disperses, go! Wait. Detention for them. We'll make a detailed check. We'd think of better ideas. Hai-sheng, I think you'd leave first. No, I can't leave you guys alone. Don't be silly. The villagers are waiting for you. Even half of the money is left, it's better than nothing. Master, but you... What's up? Hai-sheng, go! Run! See you! Leave us alone, go! Master! Butterfly! Butterfly! I am sorry! I help you to get it back. Look! Take it to save the people of your hometown. Stop talking. Butterfly. Thank you. Save me... The Taoist Pure-heart wants to harm us. Save me... Stay calm, ignore him. Let's go. Go. What's this? This seems to be a piece of jade. It's strange! Why a little girl brought me this? Welcome Taoist Pure-heart. This is a wonderful tour. Taoist Pure-heart, the Gin-xiang Jade that you want... I've already got it for you. Taoist Pure-heart, The jade found from Princess Lila... Isn't it a fake? So, the real one isn't with her. Master, please take a rest first. I am fine. I want to give Butterfly a company. From the world where I came from, we talk to people who are not around. You can talk to people who are not around? Can the other party hear you? Yes, no matter how far they are. We can talk with this device. Talk in the air? So, you are here, and I am... Can we talk if I stay in the forest? How about behind the mountain? Sure. Even if I stay here, and you go home, I can still talk to you. Liar. You didn't visit my home. Look! Are you Hai-sheng? Yes. Thank you for coming. This is 4,000 tales of gold. This is money, count it please. It's okay, see you then. See you. Gin-xiang Jade? What is it? It's said that the jade locks up a big evil. In ancient time, Emperor Zhou got the kingdom with his help. But the evil was finally locked up in the jade. The jade was divided into two. It's cursed that the two pieces could never be united so the evil'd never return. Lady, how can you get this? My dad is Prince Rong. The Emperor gave one piece of the jade... to my dad. But Taoist Pure-heart who works for the emperor... wants to use the jade to call for the Evil's return. So he stole another piece of the jade. He doesn't know that the other half is with my dad. He then frames us of betraying the country and put our family to death Master, what'd we do? Doggie, hurry up, stand up, go. Untie them. Hurry up. Line up, one by one. Come this way. Lately... I have got clear sense. These days are so enriching. Life is so meaningful. We'll open a clinic in the village. If the villagers get sick, we'll cure them. Don't you like this idea? Sure I like it. But this is a remote village. And, you're not born in this age. I am afraid you don't want to live with me. Don't think so. I like it. No matter what age, we must live together. I pack it up first, I must get more herbs later. Leave it to me. What do you want? I want to make a deal. What deal? I am the Royal Taoist Pure-heart. If you're willing to co-operate with me, I can exempt you from the penalty of stealing. I am not guilty. The corrupted officials are guilty instead. Even if I die, I don't think I did anything wrong. You're a stubborn young man. If you co-operate with me, I'll ask the government... to send food and necessities to your hometown. How can I help? I want you to give me the piece of jade. Jade? Run! What if I don't promise? I'll kill with no mercy. This place will have no lives. All people will be killed. I'll count to three. One. Stop counting. You must keep your words. Kill! You lied! Why do you kill innocent people? To trade with evils... you must be prepared to be cheated. Butterfly! Butterfly. Butterfly! Dad, I miss you, I hope to be home. Butterfly is so naughty, I guess... she is now transformed as a butterfly... and is having fun in her previous life. Previous life? This is the one. Ming, set up. Butterfly! Butterfly... Butterfly. Butterfly. Butterfly. Butterfly. Hai-sheng? What're you doing? Butterfly! Butterfly! Master, please try to save Butterfly! Gods of Sue and Xiao, please come to save. The purple air stream and red glow, Tai-ling in 9 rooms, Tai-yi at home. All gods in position, souls united. Thousand beams lead the girl's way. Thousand beams lead the girl home. May the mighty God... To help her for cutting my life short. Master! Shut up. Let her go. No, Butterfly won't go. She will stay with me. Hai-sheng, listen to me. In the other space, someone is using the same stance to call her back. But his power is greater than ours. Most important of all, it's timing. They got the timing. So... No. I can make Butterfly stay here. I can... Butterfly! I know you'd be missing her. But if you don't let her go back, if you don't let her return to her age, her soul will vanish at last. Let her go back! Butterfly! Wake up. Hai-sheng. She just returns to her own age. She is not dead. If you don't insist to keep her here, she will go home. Understand? Hai-sheng? Let me ask you. Answer me frankly. In the days we know... Have you regretted? No. I love you. Trust me. Don't be silly. Sure I trust you. I've got to go now. No! Listen to me. Time is running short. I know. I know, you ancient people... You're shy, you don't speak much. Can you... Tell me you love me, okay? I... Can't you say so? I... Well... Let me tell you. I love you. I must leave now. No... Butterfly! Butterfly! Butterfly! Butterfly! Butterfly! Don't die! Butterfly! I love you. Butterfly! I love you! Butterfly! Dad... Ming. You're awake! Don't say anything. Ming. Thank you. Dad. Why don't you get more rest? Don't worry, I am fine. Butterfly! When you lost conscious, I considered many things. You want to move back to Tokyo... Dad, you used a wrong word. I was born here. You can't use the word "back". All right. I mean, we are moving to Tokyo. Dad. You and Mom's dream is found here. And this is the place with your love and memories. So you just want to stay here, right? Butterfly! You said you can hear with this device from afar? So, you can hear it now, right? Butterfly! You must be safe. You must be happy. You must be happy! Butterfly! What's up? I am fine.
