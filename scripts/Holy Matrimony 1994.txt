Where all those little flashbulbs go off | like they do for Madonna and Cher. My mama sat alone | in the dark. Not me. Uh-uh. You know... | Marilyn wasn't always Marilyn. She had to do stuff | to get to be Marilyn. And it wasn't always | stuff she liked. She did it anyhow. [Exhales] Eye on the ball. Keep your eye | on the ball. [Knocking] Sorry, Mr. Greeson. | Is my check ready? What's the matter? | You been cryin'? Ah, forget it. You think just because | I'm the boss, I got no ears. Come on. | Sit down here. Talk to me. It's just... | [Sighs] I don't want | anyone to hear. Well, we can | go in my office. Come on. | [Jangles Keys] [Locks Safe Door] Come on. [Sighs] [Exhales] So, what is it, Havana? | You can tell me. It's... Peter. He said he really loved me... and he started screwing | the cotton candy girl. - [Crying] | - Oh, there, there, there. There, there, there, now. - [Crying Continues] | - Havana, honey. - You'll be fine. Now just | have a good cry, yes. | - [Crying Continues] Oh, that's right. - That's right. Yeah. | - He broke my heart. [Havana Mock Crying] [Mr. Greeson] You'll be fine. | Don't worry about a thing. [Mock Crying Continues] Honey, that farm hand is | beneath a beautiful woman like you. What you need is a man | mature enough to appreciate... - what a lady like you has to offer. | - I do? Sure. Hey, get your hands | off of my woman.! Come on. Let's go. | Let's go. It's right here. I got it all. [Radio Broadcast] | A Metro girl got a new lease on life... thanks to surgery | at the hospital for sick children. Tracy Hooper was given the liver | of an nine-year-old accident victim | in a four hour operation. Hooper is in critical but stable condition, ; | normal after such an operation. The forecast: ; mostly sunny | skies today with brisk winds. Expected high near 52 degrees. | Clear tonight with a low... Wake up, wake up! - We gotta pack. Pack! | - What? Come on. We gotta go, now. | Move it. Jesus Christ! | We're screwed! "PeterJakobson is being sought | for state fair robbery"! Some brilliant... - I didn't see any goddamned camera. | Move! Let's pack. | - Where are we going? [People Singing | In Hutterite German] [Man] | "Now, therefore... "if you will obey My voice and needs, | and keep My covenant... "then you shall be | a peculiar treasure unto Me... "above all people. For all the earth is mine." [Rock 'N'Roll] I never know where | I'm going to Kinda takin'it | day by day Day by day Day by day Day by day | Day by day I'm not hanging out | at some wacko commune... like a '60s leftover | waiting to get brainwashed. No phones, no TV, no newspapers; | nobody will find us. And it's not a commune. | It's, it's a colony. A religious colony. | One of 300. Well, rethink it, Peter. | The answer is no. I don't wear tie-dye. | I don't do chants. - I don't do the singing nuns. | - Okay, you got a better idea | where we could hide out? Yeah. Pull over, | give me my half of the money. I'll go to Hollywood where | nobody knows me for sure. Pull over! No. I don't feel safe with you | out there loose. I don't trust you! Don't want you around Thinks you should be free Thinks you drive me insane I'm on my way Never know where | I'm going Just kinda takin'it | day by day Day by day Day by day Day by day Day by day... [Radio Stops] - This place looks like | a goddamned penal colony. | - Hey, stop swearin'. It's not allowed here. Okay, | now you wait here. Wait! Hey! - I'm thirsty! | - You'll wait. [Teacher Talking | In Hutterite German] - [Peter] Ezekiel Jakobson.! | - Yes? Is anybody looking | for an older brother in there? Peter! | I told you he'd come back. - Peter! | - [Laughing] - You're back! | - Yes, of course I'm back. - I prayed that you'd return | and you're finally back. | - Yes, of course. - And they won't pick on me anymore. | - Who? Who won't? - The kids are still. But they won't anymore. | - Those kids picking on you? - Yeah, but they won't anymore, | because you're here. | - That's right. - You're with me. | - Yeah, it's just me and you. Huh? Me and you. - That's right. You and me. | - Mother! Mother! He's back! | Peter's back! - Not a kiss from my own mother? | - Peter. It is really you? Oh, Peter. Not one word for almost three years, now | you stand before me as if you never left. Mother, my body has returned | but my heart never left. [Sighs] | Oh, welcome home, my child. You must go | talk with elders. [Man] What have you learned | in the outside world, Peter? Of myself, Uncle. What is that? I've witnessed firsthand | the torrents of the soul. I have felt the devil's tongue. This is my home... Uncle. I belong here. I read from Proverbs: 22, 6. "Train up a child in the way | he should go. And when he is old... he will not depart from it." Welcome home, Peter. | Welcome. Thank you. Thank you. | It's good to be back. Peter. Did you leave something in | the car like me for instance? Hmm? Hi. Uh... excuse me. Uh, yes, um... | [Clears Throat] Excuse me. | Excuse me. Ow! Are you nuts? I'm trying to help us here and you're | a hair away from blowing the deal. - Put some clothes on. | - I have clothes on. | You wanna see me get naked? Do you? | What I need is a drink. You want a drink? | Okay, look. See there. That's a faucet. Knock yourself out. [Radio] [Continues] Peter... | who is that woman? She's my, uh... Uh, she's, uh... my wife. What? Your wife? Uh, um... | She's to be my wife. You know, | we do not like to judge... as our Lord, Jesus Christ | judged no one. But that woman... - hmph... | - [Continues] Does not appear | to be of our sort. Ja, ja, I agree. And that is why | she's been sent to me... to be a test of my, | of my patience... and my generosity. [Exhales] | She wants to learn our way. And God has asked me... | to show her. - Boo! | - [Dog Barking] [Sighs] | No. This is not happening! That is Zeke's way. | When he gets nervous, he passes out. Nothing to be concerned about. | Just give him a nudge. - Wake up! | - [Dog Barking] Well, my name's Havana. | And you're? Oh, I get it, | you have no name. Okay. All right. | Well... actually I'm fine. - Thank you for asking. | - I presume you're Havana. Then you presume | right on. I'm Uncle Wilhelm. | I'm the head of the Colony. - Welcome to our family, Havana. | - Thanks. It's... Uncle Wilhelm, | I see you met Havana. - Yes, we met, and it was | a beautiful moment had by all. | - Good. [Chuckles] | Colony life will be difficult at first... but it will be easier | if you live it for God's sake. There is a lot for her to learn, | Uncle Wilhelm. It'll take a little time. We are pleased that you | have decided to marry Peter... - andjoin our simple way oflife. | - He is? - She makes a fine breeder for us. | - Oh. [Chuckles] | Thank you. - Sorry, I... I have to work now. | - Okay. You can breed this! Havana, the rules of the Colony are | very strict. I had to think of something. Some way that the elders would | let you stay 'til I think of a plan... Plan? Is that what you call getting married; | figuring out a plan? What am I, a yo-yo? - Shh. | - I'm getting whiplash. I have a plan. And my plan is to go to Hollywood, | lose you forever. That is what I call a plan. - Don't go screwing with my plan. | - We'd only be married a few weeks. [Havana] | I'm not staying.! No, I'm not staying. [Sighs] [Man] Yes, there's a problem. Aproblem | with your performance in New Orleans. You're goin' out | to pick up a robbery suspect. Would you do me the courtesy | of checking the manual? Look under "appropriate use | of Bureau personnel" before | you send a 30-year veteran... - to do the job of a green-ass kid. | - Markowski, listen to me. Your credibility is suspect; you are not | in New Orleans; you are not undercover; you are in Iowa | and you are working for me. And the manual says that I... get to tell you what to do. Robbin'a state fair? Man, I used to be proud | to be an American. You're going to Canada to bring | back PeterJakobson, his accomplice... and the money. This is the job. | You wanna do it, fine. You don't; | Pension and Welfare down the hall. [Crickets Chirping] [Giggles] Damn it! Havana, come. It is our custom | to sew the dress for the wedding. - We will take the measurements. | - All right, look. If I'm gonna wear a little homemade number, | then at least I am designing it, okay? This is what I want. I want a sweetheart | collar coming from a tight bodice. - Two slits up the front. | - Oh, ja, ja. - A long, long train coming | from a shiny satin bustle. | - Ja, ja. - Can you guys do tassels? | - [All] Oh, ja. - How 'bout ruffles? | - Ja, ja. Oh, ja. - Yeah? | - Ja. - What about pleats? | - Oh, ja. Okay. | [Giggles] [People Singing | In Hutterite German] [Continues] Begehrst du diese Schwester | gern anzunehmen... [Wilhelm] | Als eine Gabe van den Hemm? Do you accept this sister | as a gift from the Lord? I do. [Wilhelm] Begehrst du ihn inallen | goettinchen Dingen gehorsan zu sein... Damit Eines den andern eine Ursach zum | Gutten und zur Gottseligkeit sine moechte? Will you be obedient to your husband | in all spiritual matters... and will you encourage | each other to lead godly lives? Yes. It's done. So, you | may kiss the bride. [Clears Throat] [Clears Throat] [Bells Chiming] [People Chattering] [Men Chattering] [Woman] | Eat well. [Woman] | Eat well, father. Psst. [Woman] | Eat well. Eat well, | Father. - Eat well and choke. | - [Woman] Oh.! [Chuckles] | She's... funny. [Clears Throat] [Spits] [Car Horn Honks] [Brakes Squeaking] This car's goin' to town. | Anybody going better jump in. Peter, when you were gone, | what did you do? - Stuff. | - What kind of stuff? I saw things. | I saw the world. Different things. Different people. And out of all the women | you saw, you decided on Havana? [Chuckles] | Yeah. Yeah, I decided | on Havana. You know, the Bible says that | goodness, kindness... purity and fullness of heart | are the qualities for a mate. - Uh-huh. | - Does Havana have these qualities? Or will we see them? Maybe we better | keep an eye on her. You got half an hour. | What do you want to do? - Can I get ice cream? | - Yeah. Look. Here's money. But don't go give it away. | It's the real thing in the real world. - It's right down there. | - Thank you. - [Children Shouting] | - [Bells On Bicycles Ringing] - Let's go! | - All right, go! [Shouting, Whooping] [Woman On TV] | A record wheat harvest this year. But only when the wheat's | in the bin and the money's in the bank... can farmers breathe | a sigh of relief. Here's a local twist on that | state fair robbery. Police are | certain that PeterJakobson... who was identified in this video | taken with a hidden camera, | has made his way into Canada... and with his accomplice will | be attempting to disappear... into one of the local | Hutterite colonies. Turning now to medical news, | scientists are encouraged with the way... [Car Engine Roaring] Are cars supposed to go | this fast? Listen, I'm going | to have to go away. You just came back. You said | you were back for good. - Things change. | - But you promised we'd be together. You and me, remember? - Hey! I hate you! | - Come on. No, stop it! Look out! | Slow down! [People Singing | In Hutterite German] [Singing] [Thunder Rumbling] [Glass Shattering] [Banging] Where is it? | [Grunts] - [Grunts] | - [Wilhelm Gasps] Havana. Havana, we do not want to disturb | your mourning time... - but may we come in? | - [Sighs] Yeah, but... Sorry about... | Sorry about the mess. Oh, we understand. | We understand. I don't. | She's messier than the turkeys. Everybody mourns | their own style. Havana, Ezekiel has a duty | that needs to be attended to. You know, the Bible | represents our law. We are very strict about | observing all aspects and all dictates. Our society... is based upon following | tradition to the letter. Please read Deuteronomy: | 25, 5. Right there. "Thou shalt not | muzzle the ox." No, no, no, | next verse. "If brethren dwell together, and one | of them die and have no child... "the wife of the dead | shall not marry unto a stranger. Her husband's brother shall go in | unto her and take her to him to wife." - Wait. What? | - What did she say? Yeah, what did I say? | "The wife of the dead shall not marry... "unto a stranger. Her husband's brother shall go in | unto her and take her to him to wife"? What is this book? | Is this a comedy or something? Uncle Wilhelm, I think maybe I should | read 'cause she must be getting this wrong. No, no, no, no, she's not incorrect, | nor the word of our Lord. Havana, Ezekiel has | an obligation by our law... to ask you... | to marry him. - [Chuckles] | - But there's no cause for alarm. You will simply | refuse him and that will be that. - What will be what? | - Well... you have to leave. - What do you mean I have to leave? | - Here. $100. - We'll drive you to the bus stop. | It'll take you to the city. | - You can't just kick me out. Nobody wants to kick you out, | but we have no choice. As an outsider, you are | not allowed to remain here. I know this seems harsh, | but it is the best. The Hutterite way of life, | Havana, is not for you. So I have to leave now | with this $100? I'm sorry. EzekielJakobson, it falls to you to perform | the duty of the brother-in-law. Ask her. Let us get this | done with. But, Uncle Wilhelm, I'm only | 12 years old. I still hate girls. - L-I'd much prefer a frog... | - Don't disgrace yourself in the eyes of God! - Ask her, please. | - But I'd make a bad husband. - Don't make me do this. | - You must, child! It's the Lord's rules. | You must please Him. Um... | [Sighs] Uh... will you... | Will you, um... - Do you wanna... | - Go ahead, Ezekiel. - Go ahead. | - Do you wanna... [Panting] Do you... wanna marry... | [Panting] You-You know what I mean. | I can't... I can't breathe. I can't breathe! [Chuckles] You guys have been out | in the sun for too long. You marry... | [Gasping] Do you wanna marry me | or not, you dumb pig? [Chuckles] | Guys, I admit... this is one goofy twist | on the whole boy-girl thing... but let's not throw the baby out | with the bathwater, okay? [Chuckles] If you would have told me | out on the street that the Bible... is the happening book that I now think it is, | you could've knocked me over with a feather. [Giggles] | But, guys, I have seen the light. I have been saved. So, if the only way | I could stick around here... and soak up more of this religion stuff | is to get hitched to the little midget... then count me in, honey. My answer is yes. - [Crashes] | - [Havana Chuckles] | I'll marry the little brat... but that little fainting trick | has got to go. - How can we allow this? | - It's not our place to challenge the Lord! We do not believe that our brother colonies | would be so literal to the written word. - We will be ridiculed! | - This is correct! - None of them will believe us! | - No one will. - There must be something. | - The Bible doesn't say | anything about children! - We must not do this! | - [Everyone Talking At Once] My people! | My people! If we begin to question | the wisdom of the Bible now... where do we start | and when do we stop? Stop it! [Crowd Muttering] [Wilhelm] Begehrst di diese | Schwester gern anzunehmen as | eine Gabe van dem Hemm? - Do you accept this sister | as a gift from the Lord? | - I do. [Crowd Muttering] Begehrst du ihn in allen goetilchen Dingen | gehorsan zu sein, Damit Eines den andern... eine Ursach zum Gutten | und zur Gottseligkeit sine moechte? Will you be obedient to your husband | in all spiritual matters... and will you encourage | each other to live godly lives? Ja, I do. [Giggling] It's done. | You may kiss the bride. I'd rather kiss a goat. Ezekiel, you may | kiss the bride... now! - Do it for me! | - Ezekiel.! Ezek... Eze... [Children Giggling] - Do you know what to do, big guy? | - [Laughing] - Don't get her too excited. | - [Laughing] - If you need any help, let me know. | - Do a good job, lover boy. Lover boy. - [Laughing] | - Lover boy. Shh, shh, shh. [Sighs] [Boy's Voices] | Nighty-night, lover boy. - Oh, yeah. | - [Chuckling] [Ezekiel] Take off your garments, | o'woman of mine.! Shh. Let me show you | what a real man is.! [Mattress Moving, | Ezekiel Moaning] Havana, stop it, | you're breaking the bed.! [Moaning Continues] Oh, Havana, | stop it, stop it. [Moaning Continues] Stop! Shh. - Shh. | - [Moaning Continues] - Honey, I'm home. | - [Boy] I'm home, lover boy. [Boys Laughing] [Sighs] Leave me alone! 6:00 in the | goddamn morning. Stop swearing! We have to go | to church. We awaken with the Lord. - Well, I sleep later than He does. | - [Knocking Continues] Get away from my door! We have to go. | You're going to get me in trouble. - Let's go. I'm ready. | - [Screaming] Oh! Well, don't do that | again then! [Door Closes] [People Singing | In Hutterite German] [Wilhelm] | Love one another as God loves you. - May peace be with you. | - [All] Amen. [People Chattering] [Boy] I can't right now. | I have to finish homework. Ezekiel. | Ezekiel. Perhaps your wife is not present this morning | because she doesn't enjoy my sermons. Oh, no, Uncle Wilhelm, | I tried to make her attend... - but she is more stubborn than our animals. | - Uh-huh. You know when a man is married, | a woman becomes his responsibility. You must teach her our ways. You have | taken the vows of holy matrimony. You are her husband. You are her comforter, her example, | her faith, her friend, her protector... her ally. Her joy is your joy. And her failings | are your failings. Yes, but... | she's bigger than me. Oh. Yeah, but... | God will provide. And like all of us, | she has duties. You will see that she attends | to your lawn; it needs cutting. The flower bed | needs weeding. Etcetera, | etcetera. Yes... Uncle Wilhelm. [Banging] [People Chattering] [Banging Continues] - Havana! | - What? Uncle Wilhelm says you have to | mow the lawn and weed the flower bed. Tell him I need a manicure | and a pedicure! You have duties to attend to! | You're my wife! And cover your head. Your hair's | not supposed to be showing. - What are you looking for? | - Nothing. Then what were you | doing in there? Looking for a rope to hang myself with. | Now leave me alone. Will you at least | weed the flower bed, please? I like weeds. Look, I'm sorry | about these mood swings. I'm working on it, | okay? It's just that I would feel a lot better | if I had a cigarette. We don't have any. I know, but... Peter hid mine somewhere. | Do you have any idea where he could | have hid them? Don't you guys have | a secret hiding place or something? [Sighs] You should be doing this. | This is your work. Getting an even tan is hard work too, | so don't knock it. I don't think | our marriage is working. Well, then we got something in common | with every married couple in America. How do you stand | the heat in those clothes? We sweat. I, uh... I found this | in the flower bed. Looks American. I guess Peter | must've dropped it. Hey, this isn't fair, | you doing all my chores. Why don't you come inside and | take a rest and I'll take over. - Are you sure? | - Positive. Okay. [Grunts] [Grunts] [Screams] Yes! [Panting] | I see it. [Grunting] [Gasps] [Panting] [Gasps, | Groans] Don't screw with me, kid! Peter was | giving the rest of that money to me! Where's the rest of it? | I want my money and I want it now! I'm your husband. Uncle Wilhelm | said you are to do as I tell you! Who's gonna make me? You? | You're gonna make me, all 60 pounds of you? If you don't start behaving like a proper wife, | I'm feeding all that money to the hogs! Over my... | dead body! You're only | making it sound better. Come here! | Come back here! If you do as you're told, | maybe I will give you the money. [Panting] Fine. | What do you want me to do? [Grunts] [Gasps] [Havana] | How come I never see guys do this work? My husband says he can't find a hoe | that fits a man's hand. Just like a man. We do all the work, | while he plays with his hose. [Women Laughing] There. I'm sorry I yelled at you. I'm trying | really hard to be a good wife | and it's difficult. But I know that you're going to help me | and Uncle Wilhelm will be very proud of you. Okay? [Laughing] [Women Chattering] [Woman] | Eat well, father. Eat well, | husband. - [Woman] Eat well, son. | - Eat well, brother. [Singing In | Hutterite German] I was going to leave | all of these lunatics And go off and have | a rich and happy life [Women | Continue Singing] Cannot stand it | All this housework I feel likeJulie Andrews [Tractor Engine] Ezekiel! | Ezekiel! [Havana] | You eat good, Zeke. You know, | I'm having the best day. It's like I've never felt | such peace before. [Sighs] I wanna thank you for | marrying me, Zeke. Thank you. Oh, that-that's okay. - Well, I have to get back to work. | - Ja. Me too. Oh. I'm not gonna be | needing that. You take such good | care of me. What do I need money for | when I have you, so... just put it back with the rest | of the money, okay. Hey, come here, you little runt! | Come here! - If I catch you, you're dead meat.! | - Shoo, shoo, shoo! [Squawking] [Screams] [Chickens Squawking] [Havana] | Hey.! Where are you? - [Squawking] | - [Screams] [Screaming] You want this? [Screaming] You've been tryin' to trick me, | just pretending to be a good wife. But let me tell you something. | You're never going to get this... - Yes! | - Money! You little, fainting, | geeky creep! I am this close to putting you | over my knee and giving you a spanking! I hate being married to you. | I hate it! Any man would. Then do something about it. | Gimme the money and I'm outta here. One quick divorce and I'm | Havana What-Was-Her-Name. - That sounds good but what's a divorce? | - It is a ticket out of hell. - No, we can't have divorce. | - No, you sit! Listen, you let me take the heat | on this one from Uncle Wilhelm, okay? If I tell him I am a lousy wife | with lousy wifely skills... and an overbearing sexual appetite, | he will cut us both a little slack. Then you give me my money, | and I am gone. Deal? Is it? [Spits] No, you got | to spit first. Okay? [Bleating] Set it in. [Whispers] | Inside. Come on. Inside. Come on. Come inside. | Come inside. Load it up. Zeke, if I can be | a little bit critical here... Ooh. Um, I think you should | lighten up a little bit. Have some fun. Stop being so serious | all the time. Be happy. Quit letting all those little kids | get the best of you all the time, you know. Zeke? Zeke! [Mock Crying] | No, this can't be. I can't believe that a man I actually | loved and married could be a thief. [Mock Crying Continues] | I thought I could trust Peter. I thought he believed | in the things I believed in. He spoke all the time | of honesty and virtues and God. What does God think? | [Sobbing] I thought who | could think anymore? I feel so... tawdry... so... soiled. Disgraced by the shame | of greed and lust. The money should | be burned. Burned? - It certainly should be. | - We must all agree. Excuse me. I agree the money is tainted, but tainted | or not, it is not ours to burn. Yeah. Yes. Leviticus says that | we must restore... that which was | deceitfully gotten. Of all of'em... [Chuckles] | I love Leviticus the most. [Men Whispering] [Sighs] Since Peter was my brother and he | carried both my name and my blood... I think that I should be the one | to return the money. But, Ezekiel, you are not | your brother's keeper. Yes, but I am the keeper of the shame | that Peter brings to my family... and to the entire Colony | with his sinful thievery. But, Ezekiel, a job like this | is... is for a man. How can I be a husband | without first being a man? Yes. Yes. | This I cannot argue. And as your wife, | I'll help you in every way I can. I'll make sure you get there. | [Sniffles] God be with you, | Ezekiel. Inside are your birth certificate, | farmer's driving permit... marriage license | for the border crossing... and $300. - That's a lot of money, Uncle Wilhelm. | - We'll bring back any extra. Here. Listen to God. - And return with God. | - I will, Mother. Okay, now, when they ask you | why we're going to the States... - what are you gonna say? | - We're going to return stolen money. - That's an excellent answer. | - Thank you. I thought so too. - It's excellent if you want to go to jail. | - What? You say that, they're gonna figure you | were in on the robbery. The first thing that they're gonna do | is burn your little hat. And the second thing they're gonna do | is take your Bible away. And the third thing | is the worst thing. - What? | - Rats. Rats in your face. Rats all night long, | back and forth. They seem to like faces more | than anything. They're bred that way. They're called... face rats. - Face rats? | - Mm-hmm. So we're gonna have to lie | a little teeny bit. Oh, I don't like to lie. You like your face | to be eaten by rats? [Sighs] | Okay. What do I have to say? Repeat after me. We are going to | visit family in Montana for the day. We are going... | to visit family... in Montana for the day. - Welcome to U.S. Of A. | - Thank you. [Laughs] - Anything to declare? | - Uh, we are visiting family in Montana. We're visiting family | in Montana. All right. I ain't deaf. I heard you | the first time. Anything to declare? [Clears Throat] Family... in Montana... | for the day. Do you have anything | to declare? Anything you wanna | tell me about? - All right, all right. | My brother robbed the fair. | - Shh. - [Panting] Rats! | Rats on my face all night long! | - Please. I don't wanna go to jail! | I hate face rats! [Horn Honking] [Horn Stops] It is our honeymoon. | He's just nervous. Pickin' 'em kind of green, | aren't ya? They're still trainable | that way. This farm permit isn't legal | in the United States, so you'll have to drive. - He can try again when he starts to shave. | - [Laughs] [Grunts] [Whispers] | Okay. [Engine Starts, Stalls, | Gears Grind] [Engine Starts] [Gears Grinding] [Pops Into Gear] [Gears Grind] Welcome to the U.S. Of A. - Why didn't you tell me you can't drive? | - I can't drive stick! What is so hard? | Come on, it's simple! - If it was so simple, I could do it! | - Look, okay. You step on the clutch | and move the gears. Then you let up on the clutch | and you step on the gas.! - I'm doing that. | - No, you're not! - [Engine Stalls] | - Aw! Why you stall so much? A little faster. | Do it a little faster. No, easily. Not so fast like that, | okay? Okay... - Okay, shift now. | - I think you got it now. This is where | our son died. [Markowski] | Where's the girl? She's gone | with her new husband. New husband? She | didn't waste any time. Ezekiel was Peter's brother. | That's our way. Ah. True love. | It's a beautiful thing. Where'd the lovebirds go? They've gone into America | to return the money. The money? - It didn't burn? | - No, it's safe. Have the Mounties | been here? No. Should I contact them? Definitely not, padre. | Hell, I'm the man you're looking for. The final man. The final man is good... | very, very good. Why can't we just sleep | in the truck? I'm through sleeping | in things with wheels. [People Chattering] I've never seen anything | like this before. There are people swimming | in the fishing pond. It's a pool. And if you like it so much, | you can sleep in it, okay. But go get me | my room first. Can't we share? | It'd be cheaper if we shared. Fine, we'll share. | Make sure it has soft beds. Good-bye. | See you later. Good-bye. [Woman Over P.A.] | Mr. Stevens to the office, please. Mr. Stevens, please come | to the office. - Hello. | - What do you want? We'd like to | share your room. - Say that again. | - My wife and I, we'd like | to share your room, please. - Our what? | - She said as long as there was | a soft bed it'd be all right. - Oh, my Lord! | - This seems fine, I guess. Get out of here, | you little weirdo! - Out! Out! | - But... - [Door Closes] | - [Whistling] [Whistling Continues] | Hey, yoo-hoo. Here's the key. There's our room. | Good-bye. Where are you going? Well, I'm going to meet | an old friend of mine. Jack... Daniels.! | Whoo-hoo! [Laughing] | Leave the door unlocked. I do love her outfit. - If you want to do it, go and do it! | - Okay. - You're going to do it anyway, right? | - Yeah. So go, go on! | Go on and do it. You don't have to yell, Harry. Women. Hmph. Let me give you some advice, | never get married. I know exactly | what you mean. Beforehand, | they treat you like a king. After you make that big mistake, | they treat you like a dog. All the time, | they're just interested in one thing. You know what that | one thing is, don't you? - The money. | - Damn straight! My new husband... | we just don't fit. I mean, every time I find a man, | it's the wrong one... and this latest one, well, | he just comes up pretty short. About four feet tall. Am I too short too? No! Uh-uh! - You look about right. Mm-hmm. | - Really? My name's Link. - And it would be, wouldn't it? | - [Chuckling] Well, my name... is Marilyn. Marilyn. Can I buy you a drink... | Marilyn? Havana, we took vows! Zeke, go back to the room. | We'll discuss this later. - Who's the half-pint? | - I'm this woman's husband! Whoa. What's | going on here? "Walk in the spirit, and ye shall | not fulfill the lust of the flesh." Zeke. You may be my husband... but I am still your elder, | so go back to our room. Maybe you didn't marry me, | Havana, but I married you! Remember that! - So you're baby-sittin' | or somethin', is that it? | - Or something. - I gotta go. | - What? Come on now, hold on, gorgeous. | We're not done yet. - Yes, I am. | - Wait. Now, come... [Ezekiel] Next to murder, you have | committed the worst sin there is.! And I'm married to it. What does he have | that I don't? Nothing... | but 20 hard years. Strong arms. | Kisses great. It was the usual | bar pickup stuff. But what about the real husband stuff? | What about that? What is that? Can you trust him? Does he pray? Is he kind to plants | and animals? Is his word golden? Isn't this what a real | husband's supposed to be? I think I'm gonna be sick. [Toilet Flushes] Wait. Come here. Please. Have you ever done... anything really rotten? Anything that | you're really ashamed of? Sure. A lot. Like what? | [Chuckles] Well, when I first met you... I wanted you to die. Oh, that's not so bad. I've wanted to die myself... | more times than not. But I don't want you... | to die now. Really? Really! Really, really. Why are you crying? It's just... a husband like you | doesn't come along every day. Is that good or bad? Oh, Zeke... any woman's gonna be lucky | to nab you. Well... I'm not that good. What about... What about | the mating part? Oh, well... that's not all | that it's cracked up to be. So... we don't have | to do that part? No. You just wait... until you're with somebody you can | love with all your heart. [Car Horn Honking] Do you see this line? Do you see this badge? Any Hutterites crossed here | in the last 12 hours? - Yeah. A kid and his wife. | - Name of EzekielJakobson by any chance? - Something like that. | - Well, I'll be damned! She married a kid! Yeah. | It takes all kinds. Okay, here you go. Wir batten Dich, Herr Gott Himmlischer | vater segne diese deine Gaben. Die wir von Deiner | reichen milden Hand. Zu nus nehum und empfagen wereden Durch. | Jesum Christem. Amen - Amen. | - [Woman] Amen. [Whispering] I was thinking. | We could split the money. What would I do | with money? Just think about this. | Okay? We could go away somewhere for a week | just like two pals hanging out. Then, after that, I'd make sure | you'd get home safe and sound. - But what about returning the money? | - Zeke! The fair doesn't need that money. They | make more money than that every day. Nobody will ever know. It'll be like | our little secret. - Deal? | - We cannot do that. - Zeke! | - "Lead me not into temptation." - Don't you want more? | - More ice cream? More everything! I have everything. Don't you want to do something | that would make you important, famous? Wouldn't you want the whole | world to know who you are? Well, God knows who I am. And I know who God is. And God knows the world. So it's kinda like | I know the world, right? And that's enough for you? Ja... with a lot left over. Um... Fine. I'm going | to the bathroom. Look! It's a helicopter. Excuse me. Miss? You know that little boy? Can you | make sure he gets to the bus station? Give him a piece of pie and in here | are exact directions where he's going. If he faints, give him a little nudge. | He'll pop up like a turnover. Don't screw it up. Keep your eyes | on the damn ball! [Radio] | I'm on my way Never know where I'm goin' | Just takin'it day by day Day by day [Radio Off] [Speaking | Hutterite German] Hey, kid... any chance | you're EzekielJakobson? I am. [Chuckles] | Well, how you doin'? - Who are you? | - I'm an old friend of Havana's. Where is she? - She deserted me. | - Oh. That's a nasty habit. | Why don't we go find her? Have you ever been left by a wife? [Chuckles] | That's your first mistake, son. You put a ring | around a woman's finger... she'll put a tighter one | around your ba... Around your nose. There she is! Okay, kid, | what do you wanna do? "Now the wicked must eat | the fruit of their own way." All right, kid, | let me show you America. Oh, for chrissakes! F.B.I.! - [Markowski] Pull over. | - Zeke, you shouldn't have told him. You shouldn't be without me. | You're my wife! Watch it! Don't hurt her! Zeke, hold on! All right, hand over the money or get | to know the color of the kid's brains. F.B.I., my ass! Oh, I'm F.B.I. All right. I'm just not | stupid F.B.I. Hand it over or I get ugly. Take it! All right, kid... | get out. Your tour is over. Zeke, get back over here! No! You make me sick. - Get in the truck. | - I am not going anywhere with you! I'm not going to sit around here | and argue with you about this. Just go away! - Come here. | - What are you... Hey! - You put me down! | - Do what I tell you. You're trying | to get us killed. Get in. - I'm your husband! You have to... | - Get in the truck! - Get in. Get down! Get down. | - What? What are you doing? Now! Go get the money. Come on! Come on! Where are | you taking me? To the state fair. To get you and this money | out of my life once and for all. Been nothing but a nightmare. | First we ditch this truck. - Why? | - Because the F.B.I. Is on us. | We don't have time to drive. - We're gonna have to fly. | - Doesn't it cost a lot of money? Who cares? | We've got it. That is not our money! | We will take a bus. You are so cheap! I do not do buses. I do not do planes! [Train Whistle Blowing] [Ezekiel] | It's cold out here. Better? Do you think that my brother | was a bad person? No. - I just think that he | didn't know how to listen. | - To what? To that little voice inside that | tells you what's okay and what's not. Do you hear it? Sometimes. It's getting pretty hazy. It better start coming clearer | 'cause this deal is getting tiring. - You want to go to sleep? | - No, I don't mean tired like that. I mean, tired like I'm sick | of pretending all the time. Here, put this on. What do | you pretend about? Well, for one thing, | my name isn't really Havana. It's not? No? It's Betsy... | Betsy Iggits. I thought Havana sounded better: | More glam, more with it. Kinda one of those | one-name things... like Madonna and Cher... | Marilyn. Who's Marilyn? Who's Marilyn? | Marilyn Monroe? - Only my hero. | - Why? Zeke, she was beautiful. She had fabulous houses | and boats and men... and cars and furs | and jewels and clothes. - And everything a girl could want. | - She had a nice family too? Well, that part | didn't work out so good. But you said that | she had everything. And if she didn't have | a nice family... it sounds like | she had nothing. It does kinda sound | like that, huh? I have a nice family. Do you? I don't know. I guess they're nice. | I don't really think about them. You don't think about | your family all the time? No! That's why | I left home. That's why I left Milwaukee, so I wouldn't | have to think about them or Milwaukee. Is that what | that Marilyn girl told you to do? 'Cause if so, she's wrong | and you should tell her... that she should go back home and see | her family before she doesn't have any left. Okay, Zeke, I told you I'd get you to | the state fair and I have. - So, if they catch me | they're gonna arrest me. | - No, they won't. You don't understand. | I helped Peter with that robbery. You did? It's a crime. | I'll go to jail. Remember... face rats? | Not my idea of a good time, either. No! Not a face rat | will touch you. I promise, I won't let | anybody take you to jail. Zeke, this is | where I get off. Go down that street and at the very end | there's a white building. Go in there, ask for | the manager's office. Tell them you want | to return the money. Will you wait here? No. I think we should say good-bye now. I'll pray for you. Thanks. I think I'll need it. Bye. Wait a second, okay. | I'm going to be right back. I just wanna make sure he's okay. [P.A. System] | Ladies and gentlemen, just a reminder... thoroughbred racing | starts at 2:;00 p.m. We've got some great horses | running here today. You're not going | to want to miss it. Post time is 2:;00 p.m. Eye on the ball. | Keep your eye on the ball. Betsy, you've gotta get outta here. | They're looking for ya. Thanks, Rusty. - Gotcha! Gimme the bag, kid! | - [Screaming] Hey! Hey! Come on! Stop him! Hey! - Help me! Help me! | - F.B.I. - Call security! | - Gimme the bag! Get the hell outta here! Ow! Run, Zeke! Roger, I heard it. Someone calling | for security in area seven. - It may be Havana. | If you see her, lock her up. | - Copy that. Kid, come on, slow down! Come on, somebody help me. - Who the heck are you? | - F.B.I. F.B.I. I don't care who you are. You better | get out from under that bull. [Markowski] | Stop that kid.! Yah! Yah! - Get going! Get going! Yah! Yah! | - Come on, slow down. You son of a... [Clown] | Balloons! Here's a green one. Thank you. Balloons! Move! No. No, | I won't faint. I won't faint! - You jerk! | - What do you think you're doing? Back off, fellas. F.B.I. [Havana] | Zeke? Zeke? F.B.I. Okay? - Stop him, stop him! | - It's over, everybody. Relax. - She's got an air conditioned cab. | - [Tractor Motor Starts] Hey, wait! Hey! [Honking] Get off of me, you bitch! No, no. Put me down. Put me down.! I'm F.B. I...! [Cheering] Put me down. | Put me down! [Zeke] | You have to let her go! She helped me! You can't | take her to jail. She's my wife! Your wife. He's my husband. If you have a problem | with me, then just deal with me. Leave him out of it. | He's a good man. - A man. | - He's the biggest man I know. | So, he's not the tallest. You're the F.B.I. | What do I do? It's up to you, sir. | You want to press charges? She was wrong to help | my brother, but she's changed! I couldn't have | returned it without her. We had to spend some of it | on the way, but... But whatever's missing, I'll work to | pay it back. I'll do whatever you want. Just don't take her to jail. Well, I don't know. | She sure did make some fool outta me. Um, could you | come here please, sir? Chapter 26, verse 6. "To forgive a woman with stain | in her hands, but health in her heart... "makes a higher man | ofhe who forgiveth. "And God | shall such remember... "when such a day of final | reckoning comes forth. For he shall be coveted | as a man among men." Sir, I think thatJob | was speaking to you. Look, son... the state fair has offered a $25,000 reward | for the return of this money. That's for you! No, I don't want | any reward. I just want my wife. I don't know if you're crazy, | orjust crazy for this woman. But you got a deal! [Men Laughing] - Welcome home, Ezekiel. | - Thanks. Sorry about that. I deserved it. Thanks for saving me back there | at the fair. You saved me back with | that quote from the Bible. I'm gonna have | to thankJob one day. No. Thank me. | I made it up. But I don't thinkJob would be mad. | It was for a good cause. You actually think I could turn out | to be a good cause, hmm? You already are! Friends forever? Forever and a day. Okay. Ah, where are you going | to go to now? Home to see my family. Havana, | will I ever see you again? No... | but you'll see Betsy. [Laughing] We're doing that again | in ten years! If you don't, I will!
