Buy fresh fish! - Good morning. - Good morning. - Good morning, Mrs mayor! - Hi, Thomas! Just a minute! - Allow me to offer you these. - No, Thomas, it's not right. I insist. Always the best for the first lady of the island. The mayor will love them. If you insist. Thanks. - Goodbye, Thomas. - Take care. - Good morning, Mrs Aphrodite. - Good morning to you. Koula, where are you, cousin? Let's have some coffee! I'm coming! I have news. About the widow? What did she do, this time? She hasn't done anything, but she will, so help me God. Are you cooking chicken in lemon sauce? The kid loves it. Of course. Alexandros likes sour stuff. - What do you mean, cousin? - Nothing. I mean that he likes to eat food in lemon sauce... like so many other people. Old Dikaios, asked to see his lawyer. So? He must have changed his will. - What do you care? - I do care! If someone has a right on his fortune, that's me. So many years I've been by his side. He pays you well. I wouldn't be his slave for free! - He doesn't owe you anything. - I didn't say that! Who else has he got? He hasn't got anyone. When the time comes, touch wood, he's got to think of me. I am a lonely girl. What can I say? I wish you the best. Although, you never know. He may leave it elsewhere. - To whom? - How should I know? Maybe to a foundation. Or even, to the island itself, for infrastructure works. Old Dikaios, really loves this island. Whatever. I should be going. I'm expecting a parcel. Take care. Nikitas, show some decency. She is a widow. Alas, to the dead one! Don't worry about her. She will find her way. All these months after the funeral... she has been going to the church day after day. What did you expect her to do? She's looking for support. And she found it in Father Labros? I meant God, you, devil! Mayor, as an educated man, you should know better. Her late husband, drowned on his own will? Of course! No, the rope wrapped itself around his neck... and the anchor sunk in order to drown him. Apostolis, I don't know how it happened... I wasn't present. For one, it wasn't suicide. - It was a face-off! - Who says such bullshit? This scoundrel, this loan-shark... was tangled in strange dealings! To hell with you! All lies! Has anything been proved? There was an inquiry. A search. The chief constable has spoken! And what did he say? Aces full, you bastard! You faggot! Yes! Chief! The owners of the cafeterias are quarreling again! Take Hiotis and put some sense to them. If I get mad, I will come down and throw them to the sea! Run! Those bastards and their cafes! I've had enough! And if the few disagree with the mass? - The mass is right? - That's true. Usually. If we take as a fact that the masses... are driven by those who want to dominate them... and want to have good time and lots of money... then, we come to the conclusion that... Olga. The masses want what the few make them want. Well done. And who are these people? The ones who have the power and we are their prisoners. What did Adamantios Korais used to say about freedom? Antonis? That freedom... should be seated in between justice and humanism. Correct! And where do we find this written in our modern history? In the last communiqui of the organization "17 November"... its free members sent when their comrades were captured. Think about it. Teaching outside again? Granddad, I've told you, I don't like to see you with this imposter. We go to the same coffee house. Do you want me to turn a cold shoulder to him? He is an imposter. All he wants is power. He keeps saying that he cares about the island... but he only cares about himself. I didn't vote for him. We only have coffee together. He pretends to be the saviour of this place and you believe him. Apostolis, your granddad can judge for himself. Tell this to your pupil. I'm not gonna let them become wimps. I'm gonna teach them not to tolerate such people. See you at home. I have barbecued white grouper for you! They don't call you "Mudjahedin" for nothing! Crazy boy! Eva? Welcome. I made some coffee. - How did you know I'm coming? - I know your schedule. Every day, at this time, you return from the church. When are you gonna realize that this guy is not for you? Because he's a priest, doesn't mean he doesn't have needs. He's gay. Aphrodite, wake up! Father Lambros, is a fruit loop. - I have seen things. - What have you seen, Eva? - Where? - In the coffee cup. Drink yours so that I can have a look. - Good morning. - Welcome. Hi, Stratos. Welcome back. Thanks. What's up? You want money. Just 20 euros for coffee. Coffee costs 20 euros in the harbor? Don't be stingy! - Bye. - Bye, Stratos. Welcome back! I don't want to put pressure on him until he readjusts himself. He just finished his military serwice. Let's have a look at yours, until I finish mine. Well... I see trouble. Cut it out! You always arrest us! I'm one step before suspending your license. It's not his first arrest. They will release him again. One day, I'll be chief! Then you'll see. What happened? Did I miss anything? The same. It's almost a tradition. Wanna go swimming in Heronisos? How? By boat? I can't. I get sea sick. - We'll take my motorbike. - This isn't a motorbike! She got up on the wrong side of the bed again today. I don't have anything to say with a Roubletas. So long! Someone needs to put her into her place! I was such a fool not to stay in the army for 5 years. I was doing fine there. At 11 o'clock. - Hello, chief. - Hello to you too. Are you going to the harbor? There was a quarrel in the morning. I know. Those two are getting into my nerwes. Let me tell you something. What kind of dealings do you have with this weasel, Ibrahim? - This is my parcel? - Yes. - Are you sure? - I'm sure, Olympia! Everyone knows that he is into some con jobs. Mayor, don't act like Sherlock Holms to me. We are both up to our necks with the same shit. I pretend not to see anything of your dodgy dealings... I'm only trying to help you. You can't trust a Turk. Why? You're afraid I might get fooled? Don't worry, I have taken my measures. - Which way are you going? - This way. Good. I go the other way. Fish, again? In the end, we will grow scales. We live in an island. What do you want us to eat? The island has a butcher shop. Eat fish! You are not in charge of my life. Can we eat in peace for once? Your dad is right. Fish is the best nutrition. Spoiled child! Stop it! Eat some. It's fresh. Thomas, just caught it. Well done, Thomas! He always gives us the best. And he's the only one who doesn't ask for favors. Don't get too excited. He's got his motives. He's preparing his son to be your son in law. What did you say? Why, woman? Stratos is a fine young boy. We are not giving our girl to the son of a fisherman! - Tell him, mom! - I like him. Then, you marry him. I will slap you so hard, you will see stars! Why are we talking about this? Has Stratos ever told you anything? He wouldn't dare. Wherever I go, he's always there. - He follows me all the time. - Cut him out. Don't worry. He took his lesson. But he doesn't seem to understand and leave me alone. The last thing we want is to have a fisherman as an in-law. My daughter has better things to do. She hears such things and she thinks she is special. I wonder why! Hello, Eva. Hi, chief. Why such formality? For you, just Babis. - How are things going? - So and so. When the summer season takes off, it will be better. You wanted something? I was on my way to the cafeterias and I just wanted to say hi. And to see if you need anything. No, thanks a lot. A beautiful woman like you... always needs the protection of a powerful man. I don't agree. Women do just fine on their own, nowadays. And if I need any protection, I always have my husband. Thomas is a capable person. He built some rooms to let... the tavern... Someone else, would think that fishing is sufficient. People might see us! Anyway, whenever you need something, don't hesitate. Thanks. I don't need anything. You never know. Thomas is on the fishing boat? Yes, he must have finished by now. Why doesn't he get a license... so he can fish in the fishing boat station? Too much bureaucracy. Yes, but the fisheries are complaining about it. For your sake he's out of jail. I will tell him to settle it as soon as possible. Whatever you need... Do not hesitate. Go to hell, you wanker. - Where is he? - What's going on? I will break his legs! Where is he? Calm down! It was just a thought! What is your mother talking about, asshole? Babis, don't talk like that! What did she say? That you've changed your mind about the school. I was thinking... I mean, there is a very good college of design. You will prepare your papers for the police academy. I have decided it and I have said it! So cut the bullshit! Understand? Babis, please, don't shout! People will hear us. He didn't commit a crime. It was just an idea. Besides, he's talented. Why waste it? Don't talk or you will pay for this! It's your fault! He wants to be a painter! Everyone will laugh at me! Fashion designer, not painter! Say it, so that I calm down. Are you out of your mind? Are you a sissy, by any chance? Because if you are, we take care of it now! Are you? Don't! You, don't talk! Say it! Are you? Babis, please! What are you doing? This is all I want. Derwenagas' son to be a seamstress! Don't insult him. He didn't say anything wrong. I just said that I like designing. First be a cop... and then paint all the walls of the house! Doors, windows... Get it? Don't! Get it? Fashion design and bullshit! I like this time of the day. Eva, if with God's help, business is good this year... next year we'll buy the one next door and expand the tavern. You don't need to struggle. We are fine the way we are. Now that Stratos is back, I have big plans. What are your plans for Stratos? Are you gonna take me with you to the fishing boat? You will take over the rooms to let... or the tavern. Whatever you like. Wherever there are more female tourists. Mom, you know me so well! - I'm going for a walk. - Be careful. Have a nice time. Yeah, right! This island is "dead". Bye! So... Connect 50 watt negative voltage to section K. Apostolis! Granddad, why don't you knock? Where you born in a boat? Haven't I told you? When my late mom went into labour... she was on my dad's fishing boat. They were on their way to the Saint Apostoles fair. That's why I was named after him. By the passage of Dionysis the Lop-sided. What time is it? What is it, granddad? I have work to do! - Food is ready! - I'm coming! Granddad! I'm sorry I yelled at you. Mister Themistoklis, sorry to bother you... but I'm going to the market. Do you want anything? Are you sleeping? Mister Themistoklis? Mister Themistoklis? - What are talking about? - What can I tell you, chief? This crazy woman was mumbling over the phone! I only understood, that he's dead. - In his bed? - I didn't ask. Do you think he was killed? Yes, they killed him to make ice cream of him. How should I know, you fool! We'll find out. She said she also called the doctor. Hurry up! She is capable of calling the coast guard. Don't laugh. Go fetch the police car. I'm going. That's all we need. What a misfortune! What do you think, doc? When I arrived, he was already dead. My first impression is he died of natural causes. You shouldn't have moved him in my absence. Has it been long, since he died? Mister Themistoklis! Do you rule out a crime? I doubt it was a crime. I can't say more before I have the results of the autopsy. Do as you wish, but do it fast. The boys? Tell me, why you called the coast guard? I was all alone, so I thought... To call the whole party. Since they were here... they helped me to put him in the stretcher. And they will help to take him to the infirmary. The ambulance's cog rail is broken. What is a "cog rail"? Leave it, Olympia. You go with them and stay there, until I say so. Yes, sir. How did this happen? When did this happen? Mr Dikaios is gone, mayor! He left me all alone! Why? If you don't stop shouting, I will shoot you! Chief, leave her. Respect her feelings. What can we do, Olympia? That's the way things are. Girl, calm down. I'm here for you. - Did you find him? - Yes. He was sitting on the porch, sipping his tea. I went to ask if he wanted anything... but he was... - How long ago? - About 2 hours ago. - This was down... - You touched it? No, I picked it up with my eye. Black humor! - Did he see anyone today? - No. Are you sure? You are insulting me. I would have known it. Olympia, knows everything. - What was in the tea? - Tea. I boiled it for him. There is some left, if you want to see. If you don't need me, I will be going. Don't disappear. I'm gonna need you for the investigation. Why? Don't tell me I'm also a suspect? Of course! You were the last person to see him alive! I was the one who informed you and I'm in trouble now? Babis, you think someone killed him? We'll find out. Nice view. He was watching us from this porch. We have to record all his things... before the maid steals everything. When will the inquiry and the post mortem be over? I want to arrange the funeral. His funeral will be exceptional, like he was. He was the lord of the island. It will be done on public expenditure. I don't bite it, mayor. You didn't even say hi to him. You are just looking for an excuse to steal more money. Fucking cop! Mayor, where are you? Tell us what happened! News travel fast! Such news travel faster than the wind! I will bring some ouzo and you'll tell us all about it. Guys, have you heard? Old Dikaios, is dead. What are talking about? Probably a stroke. Agis' lips are sealed until the inquiry is over. Do we have to discuss it? Olympia did it! She killed him with the kitchen knife... because he wanted her to do sexual things. It shows in her eyes. She killed him! You say it, because you don't like her. I bet on it. I'm sure she poisoned him. She is capable of everything! - It's clear. Poisoning. - The bitch! I knew it! Are you sure? Sleeping pills overdose. They were in his tea. The bloody woman! - Chief! - Give me a break, doc! - We are dealing with a crime. - Are you suspecting someone? Entirely. Who are they? I don't know. I have seen the guy two-three times. He had dealings with old Dikaios. - I'm innocent! - We want to help you. If you confess, you are in a better position. You are trying to pin the murder on me! Very nice of you! You know, you don't have an alibi? Nobody saw you. I told you. I was preparing lunch... and as I put the food in the oven... OK, OK! We know. You should tell us further. What? Why did you throw slipping pills in his tea? I didn't do it, you douchebag! How many times will I say it? I don't know what happened! If you didn't do it, then who, for God's sake? Nobody. Themistoklis Dikaios committed suicide. I can prove it. Easy, mister. How did you enter... Iordanis, are you sleeping again? I tried to stop them... but they said you were expecting them. And you believe everything they tell you? Disappear! - It's not his fault. - Don't you see how he is? You might not know it, but you were expecting us. The lawyer! Very handsome! Exactly. Georgios Paramithopoulos. I represent Themistoklis Dikaios. This is Mrs Eirini Theodorakis. Notary. In here lies the solution to the mystery. He had one-two months to live. Unfortunately, he led a bad life. Little by little, he was loosing control of his body. He didn't want to go through this. He wanted to die with dignity. That's why he decided to put an end to his life. He invited me here, to explain his will. This envelop contains a letter signed by him. It explains everything. There is a copy in his office. And how did you know that he committed suicide today? I was about to ask it. He called me just before he died. And the lady? I have in my hands his last will. He wished to be opened right after his death... in front of the people of the island. - All the people of the island? - Yes. Maybe he left some money to the community. All's well that ends well! And you didn't believe me. Apologize to me now. Olympia, you may go. I'm sorry. And you think it's enough? We have work to do! Take a hike! Please, sit. Come in. The view is its big asset! - Enjoy your stay. - Thanks. "At this difficult time for our island... your visit, Minister... " Who's coming? I don't know. But someone will come. Dikaios knew many people in the government. Everyone appraised him. When he was younger... because, nowadays, they pretend not to know him. And I thought that a minister was coming! Aggela, don't make me mad. The funeral will be formal! He deserwed it. Agis, are you taking the piss? You hated him. This is different. Don't talk to anyone. We'll look foolish. In any case, he was a notable person. He had authority, he was a benefactor... and he will be mentioned in the history books. You should dress the square with flags. It's not a bad idea. He's a wanker. I hate him! I despise him! I want him dead! Look at these eye bags! I have to put some moisturizer... and to trim my beard. He's a pig! He's a peasant! He only cares about himself! He never cared about our emotions. He doesn't care about me or my mother. The tough guy! The macho man! He wants to make me like him. Labros, I'm talking to you. Are you ignoring me? Of course not. Which one? I'm talking to you about my life, my future... and you worry about what to wear in the funeral? OK, but I can't go to the funeral like a crazy woman. I'll wear this one. I like red colour. What am I going to do without you? You left me on my own! Isn't he gorgeous? Look at him. He's staring at the notary. He's drooling. Let me go with him! Is anyone keeping you? You're cleaning, huh? Do you keep any ammo in the coast guard, or not? Nothing. What a brothel! Eternal memory, our beloved brother... Today is a day of bereavement. The whole village, grieves for his loss. An admirable child of this island, is gone. A nobleman, a visionary... Enough! Cut it out. The fish soup is getting cold. OK, Apostolis, I won't take long. However, I feel that everyone is waiting... to hear the last wishes of our adorable, Themistoklis Dikaios. - Yeah, but you're stalling. - I'm almost done. That's why, the notary, mrs Eirini Theodoraki... has come to our island and she will read his will. "Wankers! If you are listening to my notary reading you this... it means that I'm dead and you are gathered in the cafi. I hope Nikitas serwed you a good brandy... and not the other stuff that is not good even for cleaning. I told you. It's awful. I, Themistoklis Dikaios, being of sound mind... I hereby declare my last will and testament. You already know that I had the fortune and misfortune... to be aware of the exact date of my death... I liquidized my fortune, except for my house. The total amount is 100 million euros. An amount which is to be divided among my beneficiaries. I leave my fortune to the community... to the school, to the church... and to the police station of the island. to each body... on condition that it will be managed by each party. " What? Get some brandy! Quiet! Slap her twice! - Is she ok? May I? - Yes, please. "The money will be theirs on one condition. each and everyone... of the local notabilities must be read. They will be read in public... in the presence of the citizens of this island... within a week's time. If there is an objection... the money that they were meant for them... will be given elsewhere. " Of course they will agree. The bastards! These are the letters with your names. He didn't leave me anything! The old fool! I spent my best years next to him! Imagine what the worse were. Burn in hell! This can't go on. Put her in the basement. - Iordanis! - Here! Let me speak! I will tell everything! You won't take my fortune! I know things about all of you! You won't know where to hide! - Come, Mrs Olympia. - Miss! Give me the brandy! Try to stop her now! Leave me alone! Old fart! Leave me alone! No, hold me. Punks! I'll show you! Mayor, would you like me to start by reading your letter? Look... I don't think it's the right time. I would prefer to do it under better circumstances. But, since, the will allows me to wait a week... I'm going to wait. I don't know what the others want to do. The mayor is right. Another time. Yes, today we grieve for our late brother. In any case, we are not going anywhere. Let's go. We have to talk. All four of us. I was thinking the same. Tonight, at 10, in the mayor's office. I will inform "Mudjahedin" and the priest. You got us into big trouble! Aggela! - Mom, 25 million! - Stop it! We know it. On the way back, you haven't stopped saying it. Relax! Why relax? Our whole life is going to change! All my dreams will come true. I will leave this place! The money is not in our hands yet! In any case, it belongs to the community. Your father is only going to manage it. Yeah, right! Dad, why didn't you open the envelope? - It's not that simple. - OK. Of course, you are the mayor. You showed some decency. It's ok. We can always take the money tomorrow. You won't tell me what to do. I will think about it and decide. Tell me, that there is a chance that we won't take it. Bullshit! What are you afraid off? Nothing. But we have said that in here you won't talk like that! As for the money... if I decide to keep it, it's not mine. It belongs to the community. I'll only do the managing. You won't steal from such a big fund... when you already grab money from the community? I will slap you! Agis, please. Get the hell out of here! I don't want to see you! Too bad I can't open the envelope! But I won't allow you to destroy my future... because you don't want people to know your sins! She went crazy with all this money. She has her dreams. - What are you going to do? - I don't know. Are you thinking of opening it? I told you. I don't know. Don't push me! I asked you to come here... in order to see what we'll do. We all have secrets we don't want revealed. Except for me, of course. A man of God, has no secrets, eh? Give us a break! If this is the case, why didn't you open the letter? He's right. Who knows what things you have done. Shame on you! Then, why did they sent you here, from Athens? "Adverse transfer!" Who knows where did you put your ass... hand. I swear, I haven't done anything like this. Why? You have done other things? Stop staring at me. You are a faggot! Apostolis, you don't know what you're saying. Give me a break all of you! Liars! Imposters! Look who's talking, you anarchist-communist! Who knows how many banks you have destroyed in Athens! Hear, hear! Teacher, they say! He teaches our kids! Do you have proof? You don't have the right to talk, thieves! Frauds! What did you say, communist? Who is it? Are you crazy? What are you doing here at this hour? We need to talk. What else? The will! I met the others, to see what we'll do. And what have you decided? - See? - I get it. It was all so sudden. Who expected this? I don't know what to do. I'm going crazy. On one hand, I'm thinking about the money... and on the other, I'm shaking. Who knows what it's in the letter. Do you think Dikaios has proof of your dirty deeds? Are you insane? This is the least of my worries! If he knew about Markos? You are gorgeous! I want to eat you! Stop it! Markos, may come in any time! Please, stop it! You are a very bad boy! And what do I do to the bad boys? I punish them! Spread your legs! What's wrong, babe? Why did you stop? You bitch! I will kill you! Sit down! Down! Wait. What happened, wanker? You were not satisfied with the money I pay you... so you wanted to fuck my wife? - Down. - I'm down. You wanna fuck my wife too? Markos, calm down. We'll figure it out. It was just a mistake. Fuck you, wanker! Wanker! Bitch! - Come here. - It's not what you think. I'm telling you the truth! Marko, mercy me! Why should I show you mercy? Bend, you bitch! Bend, the way you did it for the old man! I wasn't enough for you? You cow mouth! What does this mean? Is it bad? Whore, are you making fun of me? I will cut you into pieces and throw you to the sea! You wanted to kill me? The wanker, wanted to kill me! Is he dead? He's alive. Shut up! - He passed out. - And if he wakes up? Tie it around his neck. The bastard! I miss you! I haven't stopped wanting you. You owe me. Don't forget it. We haven't had sex since the day he drowned. You haven't come to my office, not even once. Like the old times. You forget that I'm a widow? I don't want people to talk. I had enough with their gossip. Is it because you like the priest? Go to hell! It's over between us. I don't want anything to do with you. It's over! Listen. If you try to trick me, I will drag you with me. I wasn't alone in this. I don't know. I'm gonna be late. It's my business when I want the letter to be opened. Easy, Loula. I'm not going to report to you. Give me a break. I'll do as I want. "Heidi 88." Where did they find such an old porn movie? Finally, real breasts! Enough with the silicone! You seem like a nice bitch! Let's see what you can do. No way! It can't be! Thank you God! Do you need something? - I can't open... - You want me to help you? Usually, I don't give my keys to people I don't know. Stratos. Eirini. Nice to meet you... Really. Handsome and gentleman. The girls, here, must be chasing you. - I wouldn't say that. - How come? Things have changed so much? Unless you refer to specific girls. I'm sorry. I don't want to sound indiscreet. On the contrary. I wanna get it all out! But, I don't want to bother you at this hour. No bother at all! I was about to drink a glass of wine in the veranda. Although, I don't like to drink on my own. What do you think? I don't know what to tell you. It's not my business, but it's a big opportunity. You should have let them open the envelope. So much money. Granddad, I wouldn't leave my comrades... for anything in this world. We have a fight to give. What comrades? What fight? Again, with the same bullshit? All these, are on your mind. Conspiracies, are on your mind. No one wanted to hurt you. Not even Dikaios, when we were talking about you. This is what I'm afraid of. What is that you were discussing about me. I'm sure, that fascist, Olympia, was also present. Give me a break. What would I say about you? Your idle fancies that you want to change the world? So he thinks you are crazy? So, what are you going to do? - Olympia! - Go away! Yes, your holiness. Don't worry. Everything will go as you wish. No, no problem. I will deal with it. It's just that the notary gave us a week's notice... in order for all the letters to be opened simultaneously. It's not my fault. The others stall. Ah, you already know. There are some "well wishers"... who are gossiping about me. It' won't happen! Always, in a good manor. Your blessing, sir! Problems with the high ranks? It's a sin to overhear other people's conversations. You were shouting. Don't they trust you? A holly person? The whole parish respects you. Especially, some people, more than the others. Father? You? I thought I heard someone. I'm here with Alexandros. We were talking. Hi, aunty. What are you doing here? What are you doing here? I was showing Alexandros... The view! You tell your mom, that I will come by tonight... about the design. - What design? - For the lace. She's preparing your dowry. Lucky girl, whoever marries you. I'm curious to know what the letter says about you. He was always interested when I was talking about you. Bless me, father. As always, they sued each other. We should do something... or they are capable of doing this the whole summer. We'll deal with this later. You spent your night here? Yes. You were thinking of old Dikaios? What is this with the letters? When are you thinking of opening yours? Whenever I want. I won't inform you. Get yourself together! Go get me coffee and send someone to clean. I'm trying to protect you. People talk. This crazy woman, Olympia, gossips about you all the time. It doesn't take long... Go away! Go! Eva! Thomas! You're early. Leave it there. I wanted to talk to you. Sit down. Don't worry. There is no one here. Sit. What happened? I'm scared. What might be written in Agis' letter. - I don't expect... - Why not? I believe that old Dikaios knew everything. And why to reveal to Agis that Nena is not his child? To take revenge. To embarrass him in the whole island. They were enemies. If that's why Agis doesn't want to open the letter... it means he knows everything. He knows Nena is my daughter. What's wrong? I can't stand it anymore. I've been living a lie all these years. Why did we allow them to do what they wanted with us? What could we have done? They would never give the mayor's daughter to a fisherman. We were kids! - You haven't regretted it? - What's wrong with you now? It's closing time, chief. You wanted something? - What's up, gorgeous? - Really, if you don't want... I want something and I will get it right here right now! Go to hell, wanker. My little Heidi, is mad? What? You can't imagine what you can find on the internet. Even porn movies of the '80s. You are photogenic. What are you planning on doing with this? If you are nice to me, nothing. What do you want? A clay pot. What do you think? Thomas, I don't believe it! After all these years, it was exactly the same. I never got over you. Are we mad? In your house? - If Agis returns home? - He can go to hell. Thomas, we should do something about our kids. What do you mean? Do you know that Stratos likes Nena? What? She says she doesn't want him, but you can never be sure. What are we going to do? Who is it? It's me. Open up! Are you playing games? Alexandros, go away. Open up! Open the door! I will wake up the whole village! - Will you stop? - Why didn't you open the door? Alexandros, listen. We can't go on like this. The whole village talks about me. My crazy cousin is not "the whole village". Go away, before they see us. If you don't want them to see me, let me in. It's not easy for me, but it's over. From now on, I have to be spotless. I don't believe it. You are also for the money? You are throwing me out, cause you want the money? It's not like that. There are some issues with the eparchy. There is no room for scandals. I thought you were different. You are all the same shit! Good night. Go to hell! Coward! - What are you watching? - A movie. - Where is mom? - She hasn't returned yet? I thought she was coming with you. You are also late. I wanted to see you before I left. You want money? No, but, I wouldn't mind. Don't wait me up. - A woman? - Maybe. Someone told me... that there's something going on between you and Nena. Even in the army, we had a worse information network. Is it true? I like her, but she doesn't want me. - And it bothers you? - No way! She can go to hell. There are plenty of women. Exactly! We won't stick to one chick! You're back? I'm leaving. See you. Take care! You had a busy day today? I'm gonna take a shower. You tried to mess with Olympia? I'll show you! Hello? What do you want so early? What dead body? I'm the biggest dead body! Who? I'm coming. Bad luck! Loula! Speak! Who did it? And speak now, cause we'll all be held responsible! Are you completely insane? That's why you brought us here? You wanted to come to the police station? They all talk about us. Imagine what would happen if they saw us in the station... as soon as Olympias' body was found! You don't mean I'm one of the suspects? Why, father? Do you have a clean bill from God? She called you a faggot! So you had a motive. Apostolis, these vulgar words don't help! OK, sister! Tell me, who did it! We don't have time! Why? The crazy woman will resurrect... and name her killer? A unit from Athens is coming to the island... to take over the investigation. Why did you inform them? You think I'm a fool? The notary did it. I'm sure, she spoke about all of us. So, you are also a suspect. Don't act like an innocent girl! When this is over, I will show you, Mudjahedin! Don't say it so abruptly, cause I'm shaking! Cut the bullshit! That's what I'm saying. Who did it? Who? The chief constable! The gentlemen? Chief Inspector Konstantinos Athanasiou, Athens Homicide. My aid, Inspector Baronas. You have been informed about our arrival. By fax! But, there was no need for you to come all this way. Chief, I should be going. You don't need me here. Yes... Come here! Go! Go! Go with him to prepare my office. I will be using the station to perform the inquiry. My office? OK. No problem. Iordanis, my good boy, escort the gentleman... and help him with whatever he needs. As I was saying, you didn't have to come. Things here are quiet. It's only a case. We could solve it ourselves. Here, nothing really happens. Chief, what was that again? I'm fed up with performing post mortems. Have you finished your phone call? - Will you inform us, now? - Yes, of course. I apologize. The woman, Olympia, didn't drown. Easy, easy. Her body was swollen. She was found by the sea! When she fell into the sea, she was already dead. There was no trace of water in her lungs. There are traces of fight? Yes, a blow into the back of her head. It was a lethal one. She was already dead when she fell into the sea. She fell, or someone pushed her? In my opinion, all 4 of them are suspects. That's why I called you here. Anyone of the 3 others. They didn't like her. I didn't have any reason to kill her. The other 3 say these things? Bullshit. Lies! I might have said something when I was upset. Nothing serious. She was accusing everyone! Let's be serious. I'm a responsible and trustworthy person. Do you think I would risk my family's reputation... and of course my political career... to try to get rid of such an insignificant person? I can't say that he adored her. The feelings were mutual. Agisilaos, says this? The other 3 told you things? If I told you you won the Oscar would you go to accept it? Lies! And I know who spreads all these lies! The anarchist! The terrorist! The teacher! If he can be called a teacher! Arrest him! I'm sure he killed her. Are you in the mood to search the victim's house? Dad, I'm not gonna leave you in peace! I can see that! You are chasing me all the time. You haven't seen anything yet. Wake up! The deadline expires tomorrow. If you don't open the letter we are gonna loose 25 million! - Keep your voice down. -25! Stop repeating it. You think I don't know? Or that I don't want the money? Give me a break! Bastard! Olympia! - How are you? - Fine. The lady hit on you? Yes! Why? Is there a problem? No, I just don't understand what she sees in you. She must have seen something that she liked. What some local lazy women can't see. - Who's lazy? - Did I say your name? Are you trying to kill me? Why did you tell them I didn't like your cousin? - Stop it! - Why stop? Don't you understand that now I'm a suspect? Leave her alone, bastard! Try this again and you are dead! I swear, you hear me? No, my son! Don't. What did you do? Who did you try to beat? You, old fool! You think we are objects! You think you owe us and you can do as you please! Come into your senses! Yes! You belong to me! I will do as I please! I say talk, you talk! I say shut up, you shut up! Understand? No, you wanker! I don't understand! And if you want to know, I shit on your face! Don't, boy! Let him speak. He has more to say. You are funny. Come on, talk. I'm funny? Listen to this, so you have a better laugh. I'm gay! I like guys! I had a relationship with Lambros for over a year. What do you think of this joke? Hm? Nice? Now, laugh! Father Lambros and my son? Father Lambros? Come here! I'm gonna kill you! It's not what you think! You are dead! The winds started early this year. She is a widow! How could you hide such a thing? If you were in my position... What position? Someone killing my husband in front of me? He caught us having sex. What are they talking about? He would have killed us! - Tell me that you helped him! - Are you crazy? He did everything alone. I could never keep such a secret. I need your support, not your criticism. I'm scared! He killed Markos. He might have killed Olympia. And now? Who's next in line? Father Lambros? Chief? My Lambros! Come here, you sissy! Come back! Move! - You're gonna die here. - Let's talk about it, first. I will talk about it with your corpse! Inside! Down! I don't know what they told you. It's all lies! But, you don't know what they told me! Lie down! Say your last prayer! - Thanks a lot. - My pleasure, father. Believe me. Lambros... He is probably shocked. Let's go, granddad. As you are all aware, the deadline has expired. Since, none of the 4 wished to accept it... the letters are withdrawn and will not be opened. There is a third letter concerning all 4 trustees... as well as a codicil. I will read the letter right away. "Agis, Babis, Apostolis and Father Lambros. I was sure that none of you would dare to open the letter. You all have done things. I'm the only person who cannot accuse you of anything... simply because I don't have any proof. You lost the money for nothing. The truth is I never liked you. Agis is pretending he is the nation's father. Babis, is an uncivilized chauvinist pig... with power in his hands. Apostolis, is a petty revolutionist... who thinks he can change the country... by poisoning children's minds. And Father Lambros, cause he's an hypocrite. Not only he doesn't abides by what he preaches... but also, he uses the church to his advantage. For all these reasons, I wanted to scare you. Make you sweat like pigs. Make you like the idea of having the money... but not give you the opportunity to take it. And I succeed. As you know, I have nothing to hide. The community's books are spick and span. As himself says in his will he has no evidence against me. I followed the others and didn't open the letter. Yeah, you baby! Say the truth! People will see what a lovely mayor they have! What are you talking about? You covered your bad dealings... but you didn't say anything about the murder. Babis, shut up! You should have known better when you turned me in! He killed Markos along with his girlfriend, Aphrodite... the sad widow! You didn't tell me that. He's lying. - Bastard! - He's lying! You can't prove anything. There is no evidence. You think I destroyed the evidence? I kept everything proving your guilt... in case you did something to me. You're gonna die! Leave me alone! I did the right thing by turning you in! You have sold all the antiquities of the island... in order to pay your debts from gambling, you punk! Go to hell! The mayor is right. I have witnessed your dealings with the Turks many times. Go and delete your wife's porn from the internet... and then talk, baldy! Bastard, what did you say? What is he talking about? And you gave me lessons on morality. When you show your ass to the whole planet? At least, I didn't kill. Peace be with you! Don't forget you are friends. Keep your nose out of this, sissy! Go and fuck a young boy and leave me alone. I'm innocent, you hear me? I loved Markos! I loved him! Come here! Sit down! Don't talk to me like that. Don't touch me. I despise you. I had enough of you! Enough! And you should know that Nena is not your child. She is Thomas' child. I like seeing your values becoming dust in the wind. Hi, Sister Lambros! Don't worry and I will tell everyone about you! You terrorist! I'm listening! The priest is right. Your photo is in every police station. We have been following you for a long time. Don't move or I will blow all of us to pieces! Apostolis, take it easy! Tell him to put down his weapon! Think about all the mess you are gonna cause. Think about all the innocent lives you'll take with you. Do not follow me, or there will be a massacre! Iordanis! All this for nothing. We lost so much money. What do you mean? No one gets anything? No, no no! It is clear. "Thus, beneficiary of my fortune is Olympia Lainis. " Olympia is dead! In this case, the money goes to the next of kin. Yeah, but who killed Olympia? Unknown! Her death is an unresolved mystery. Some say it was an accident. Some others that one of the 4 killed her. They all agree in one thing. That she asked for it. Now I got you, mongrels. (Help!) Hello! This movie was filmed in the island of Sifnos in 2009. Any similarity with persons, facts and situations is purely fictitious... and a product of the ( sick) mind of our scriptwriters. This movie would not be filmed... without the help and support of the real mayor of Sifnos... Mr Gianiis Gerantis and of the citizens of the island... We thank you all!!! Come here! I'm gonna kill you! I have to put some moistu... Again! I love you!
