Three. Two. - We can only take what fits in the truck. - I'm not talking about the damn truck. Hey, here she is. My girl. Come here You're wet. You look completely different. Not so different. I wouldn't know you on the street. I would know you Vati. That is comforting. Lore. Wake the twins, We have to pack. Vati, Are you coming? Aren't you going to answer her? Just six plates and cups, but take the silverware. All of it. Liescher, what are you doing? Help your sister. Did I ask you to pack the glasses? You have to listen. We called him Peter, like your Vati. Here take him, he's wet. Pick it up Gnter! Clutz! You are! Law for the Prevention of. Hereditary diseased off spring. CONFIDENTIAL. Vati? l'm just getting her some water. Mrs Richter will look after her until come back. Now go back to your mother. Please go. C'mon girl, out. How are we better off here? They'll find us. Hurry! Careful damn it! You're such a coward. Are you coming back Vati? Heil Hitler. Is your mother awake? Yes. Take this. Gnter, hurry! The Fhrer. Don't touch it. Come. Come away from here. It's coming Mutti isn't it? What? The final victory. Put the others to bed. I'll be back soon. Mutti? Stay away from me! What has happened? Put the blanket over it. Please cover it Mama. Go away! Why are you looking at me? Stop it. Do you hear? He's gone. It is the end. He's dead Lore. Vati? Vati. Our Fhrer Lore. He's dead. Mutti? There is nothing for Peter. Hello. Hello. We wondered if we might buy some food? - Is your mama still here? - Yes, of course. We thought they had taken her to prison. I have to join your Father. If I'm not back in three days, you must go to Omi. Go to the train station and buy tickets to Hamburg. And from there to Husum. And then over the mud. You remember Lore? Hamburg is far. If I don't go willingly, they will come and take me. Use the money first. There is jewellery in my big suitcase. Are you going to prison? You mustn't worry. I won't. It is a camp. Yes. It is not a prison. Prison is for criminals. Take him. Take him. Take him! Aren't you taking him? They kill all the children. You're not coming back are you? You must remember who you are. You mustn't worry. They will be here soon. But we mustn't be afraid. Before the victory there is always pain. Hold his head up. It mustn't go under. - If he goes under would he drown? - He might. A boy drowned in Hamburg, in Jenisch Park. What did he look like? You didn't see a thing, you ran away. What is that? This is Omi's house. There's blue windmills on the wall. Lots of them. Wait 'til you see. And who is she? Mutti's sister. She died in the first war. She had a bad cough and then she died. Where's Mutti? Close by, with Vati. If They are close, why don't they come and get us. They are probably thinking about where we will live, and what colours they will paint the house. Things like this. Why won't he open the door? I caught him stealing. I don't know how your parents brought you up. You think you can just help yourselves? Get up! This is not your house, no one wants you here! We'll keep the baby but the rest of you must go. Let go, I want Mutti. Get in there. Let him out! A German boy does not steal and then cry like a baby. - When is Mutti coming back? - Never! Go away! Gnter is a dirty little thief. Now we have to go. All because of Gnter! She said for us to wait! Come out! It's all your fault. The Americans have special little prisons for children like you. Horrible places, where children are tortured. Maybe she will come tomorrow. I don't want to go prison Lore. No, she's not coming. She's at Omi's. I spoke to her. You were not there. She's at Omi's. Vati too. I can pay you! I can pay you. We want to go to the train station. Did your mother make that dress? This is from a store. Where's your mother now? Hamburg, with Omi! And your father? Dead? He's fighting. Then he's a fool. We don't have any trains anymore. The Americans took them. You're heading for Karlsruhe on this road. Over to the French if you go too far. - We want to go to Hamburg. - Go across the field, you'll see the road. Here. For the baby. Attention, attention! We are under American control. Shooting from behind, sabotage and looting are prohibited. These crimes will be punished by death. All Germans and non-Germans are instructed to go home. You are only allowed outside between 8-10am and 4-6pm. Can you help me? You have to push. I want to have a go. - No, let go. - Stop it, what are you doing? What are you doing? It's already broken. Doesn't matter, leave it. Go sit over there. Where is Gnter? Excuse me. There was lot of blood on her legs. And thousand of ants. Maybe they live inside her body and ride around in boats. I don't think so. Maybe her blood has become really thick like jelly. A boat might not work. Excuse me, would you have any food for us? I can give you something for it. Don't put so much wood on it. Maybe blow on it a little. Not so hard, you'll just blow it out. Liesel pour the eggs into the bowl. Leave the fire alone. Will you stop it! Don't blow - it's no use! We'll eat the eggs raw. Sit here. This is my brother, Peter. He's hungry. Here. Clean yourself. I said please could you clean yourself. I had to look at dead Jews for hours, just to get stale bread. But you got two loaves! I have diabetes, I'm the one who deserves two loaves. And I got nothing! If the Fhrer knew that! Let me see. Try that. That boy was at the school house. Come quickly! Who's afraid of the black man? Who are you child? We just want something to eat. We? Where are they - mother, father? I have water. That is all. This baby has bed bugs. They are all dead. I have nothing. I have paraffin. What can you give me? But that's worth more than paraffin. Anything else? Then I'll get you food the village. This is my mother's. It won't work. You gave her too much. You shouldn't have given her the ring. What else have you got? Nothing. It stinks. Stink of shit. Scratch all your skin off, until you are only a heap of blood and bones. I don't care anymore. I used to have a comrade. You won't find a better one. The drum called us to battle. He marched by my side. With the same pace and stride. A bullet came flying. Was it meant for you or me? It tore him away. He was lying at my feet. As if he was a part of me. His hand is reaching out for mine, While l'm reloading my gun. I can't give you my hand, but in eternal life, remain my good comrade! That was lovely. So beautiful. We broke his heart, he loved us so much. And the lies. Those Americans. With their photographs. Actors. The Americans paid all of them. Come here, my little one. Come! Come on. Come! Get outside. Put on your clothes! You can stay here. With the baby they give you food. You have the boys, yes? The twins? Leave me the baby. What did she mean? What she said about the Fhrer? Nothing. She didn't mean anything. Is the Fhrer sad? Lieschen? Please? The moon has risen. The golden stars are sparking, bright and clear in the sky. The forest stands... Keep walking. Hey! You! Hey! You! Stay here. Come here. Stay. Mother? Father? - We haven't done anything. - What? We don't know him. Papers! We don't it's. Where are going you? - Papers! Travel only with permission. - He was at the school. He's following us. Shutdown! Run some? I have papers. We need a lift. At least as far as Schweinfurt? - Who is you? - Thomas. l'm their brother. Hey, you! You. Coming. Your name? Liesel. Liesel? Who is this, Liesel? Who is this? Our brother. We've just been to Ansbach, looking for food, and have been walking. - Where have their papers? - Lost. We lost them in Buchenwald. We were moved to Buchenwald from Auschwitz, and we were there until liberation. We have to go to Omi. - What Omi? - Yes, Omi, we have to go to Omi. In Hamburg. In Hamburg. Hamburg? She's worse. Thomas got us food. Who said you could take the baby? When my father comes, he will deal with you. So when is he coming? Shut up. You only eat from that side. Stop it. I know what you are. You're a Jew. I saw it on your papers. I don't want you touching them, do you understand me? One. Two. Three. Four. Five. Six. Thomas says we're not allowed in Hamburg. He said it's over the border. Germany is all broken up. There's a Russian zone, a British zone, a French zone. We're in the American one. Hamburg is in Germany. Thomas says there isn't a Germany. He said the Russians hate us. All the enemies hate us and we can't be trusted anymore. And all the men will be punished. Why don't you like him? You don't know anything about him. He gives us food. He gets food because of Peter, that's why he stays with us. He's a parasite. Mutti wouldn't like him. But Mutti also said there were trains. Well I like him. Why are there trees growing on the roof? They're camouflage. - Why? - Because they built bombs. Did you fight? No I was in prison. What did you do? I stole. Did you have a gun? No. My Vati is fighting in Belarus. What do you want? I don't want to swim it Lore. - It's easy. - Shut up, Gnter. You can't even swim. I can swim with Peter. You'll get to the other side and leave us. We have to cross here. There are no bridges for days. I'll go down there and have a look. Go back! Hello. God! You gave me a scare. What are you doing down here? I am walking. I can see that. My grandmother lives cross there. And your parents? She has a house with windmills on walls. And a big garden with flowers. - Do you know the house? - No. Strange heat today. I need to cross the river. Come here. Let me have a look at you. Closer, I don't bite. I'can sing something for you. Yes. Go on. Little brother dance with me, take my hands. Clap clap clap go the hands, tap tap tap go the feet. Go this way, then that way, twirl around, it's easy. There's water in it. A broken watch and a little deer for my trouble. - It's all I've got. - Do you know how much work I have ahead of me? And a bleating wife at home. If don't get this done, no dinner for me. Child, you smell like death. What have we done? Don't touch me. Lore did not mean to. She didn't mean it. Fucking turn off anyway. Not, just to way. If they ask you anything I'm your brother, and our parents are dead. Just say that. Wait here. - Have you seen my brother? - Piss off! Did you tell them? What? Did you tell them what we did? He said the trains are running again. But they won't let us through. We'll walk at night. It's safer. Come. Lore. What language was that boy speaking? Polish. We're in the Russian zone. We need to get into the British one. They're from a camp. Come. Quiet! Someone's cooking. I'm hungry. Quiet. You don't move'til I get back. Will Thomas be back? Gnter. Come here, sit down on the blanket. He's coming. Thomas! Thomas! He's brought someone. Thomas! Here! Thomas! Gnter! Stop! (Russian) Gnter! Run! Come on! Gnter! They shot him. You should have stayed down like I told you. It's your fault they shot him. You stole their food and now he's dead. He fell down. He ran the wrong way. He should have stayed in the trees. On the ground. Like I told you! Leave it on! He should have kept quiet. He thought it was you. It wasn't me. Gnter? Eat! I don't want to. Eat your bread! I don't want to. Eat it! If you don't come now I'll go without you. You can't leave us. There are no more borders now, you can get there by yourselves. You've got the baby, they'll let you on the train. If you stay, I'll let you keep the baby. You can keep Peter. I'll tell everybody he died. I don't want him. You can pretend he's your brother. I don't want him. You won't get away with it. They'll find you. And you will be punished, Like all the others. Like all the men that did bad thing. There people every where that did. No one cares. I can't help you anymore. I told them Mutti and Vati would be there. But they're not. I don't care. You lie! You always lie. You can't help it. All you filthy Jews! Sometimes I look at you, and I can see them. One lie after the other. They are everywhere. I can't stop thinking of it. I can't stop thinking of it. Were they the same pictures as before? No, different ones. One was in Poland, I think. The others were in Germany. There was one of women in a pit. Lots of women. Naked. A little boy. They're exaggerating it. They're always the same photos, just a different angle each time. An the people are thin and lying on the ground. But it said they killed them. Shut up. Stop talking about it. It's not like the soldiers in these pictures killed all these people. You don't see any pictures of them actually killing them right? Ticket! My wallet. It has to be here. Do you promise not to tell? What? I only did it so he couldn't go. It's not him. Thomas Weil. He said it didn't matter. The man was a Jew. He was dead already. The Americans like Jews. So he pretended to be a Jew. So what is his name? He didn't tell. They are the dead Jew's photos. Is this Omi's house? I think so. Are you sure? The lights are on. Berta! Be quiet! Who's there? Hannelore, Omi. My god, Hannelore! Where is my Asta? Where is Mutti? Where have you come from child? From the Black Forest, Omi. Come on, sit, sit. You have all grown so big. And here's little Peter. And this is Gnter. No. No, he is dead. In Russia. This is Jrgen. You lied. She said Mutti would be here. I'm sure Lore didn't lie. She's not here, because she's being punished. Isn't she Omi. She's in prison with Vati. You must never feel ashamed of them. It is all over now. Your parents did nothing wrong. You know that, don't you? Look at me when I'm talkin! They did nothing wrong. Yes. Come. Give me your arm. Hannelore Dressler! Let me look at you. The The last time I saw you, you were a little girl! Come sit down. So what would you like for breakfast? Show her the dance Wiebke! - I'm alright. - Come on, Lore, you'll like it. Leave me be. She never wants to do anything fun. I don't believe that Lore! Look. Your hand goes here, you be the lady. And now. Look, here, Zulu! Give me your hans and now... Please. I can't. "Thomas with Lisa - 1936" "Lisa Breakfast - Spreewald" A good boy waits until he is served. Put it on your plate, you've touched it now. Where did you learn such a thing? What are you doing? Put it down at one, Hannelore. You may leave the table.
