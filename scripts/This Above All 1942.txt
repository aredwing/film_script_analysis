Very good, Miss Prudence. You must please be more careful with the blackout curtains, Mary. Miss Prudence will be a little late. At 6:15 this evening in the forest of Compigne... an armistice was signed between France and Germany. The resistance of France has ended. Her surrender is absolute. Her fall, complete. In Berlin tonight, a government spokesman declared... that the conquest of Britain by the end of September is now definitely assured. He pointed out that the channel between Dover and Calais... is a mere seven minutes flying distance. That's one good thing about the wireless- You can always turn it off. - Some sherry, Mrs. Dexter? - Thank you. It's all so unreal and terrible. It's that announcer fellow that annoys me. He talks as if he had a mouthful of golf balls. It's wonderful that he can be so cheerful... when he has to tell us such awful things. - Dinner is served, sir. - Oh, thank you, Parsons. Thank you. - Miss Prudence telephoned, sir. She said she'd be a little late. - Oh. Is Dr. Roger in yet? - Not yet, sir. - We'll give him another five minutes. Why, Roger, you certainly keep late hours nowadays. Oh, hello, Willfred. Good evening, everybody. - I'm sorry. I hope I haven't kept you waiting. - That's all right, Roger. How do you do, Vicar, Mrs. Malcolm? Your hospital must be getting some pretty bad cases. They're sending the worst straight to the west country. Most of ours are shock exposures. When men haven't slept for days on end, you have to teach them how to close their eyes. - Heard the news this evening? - Yes. Oh, thank you, Parsons. Well, we know now where we stand, don't we? Napolon conquered the whole of Europe, but he never touched England. Napolon didn't have 15,000 bombers. Well, there's no need for us to get excited. - Don't you think perhaps it's time we did get excited? - Why, Roger, please! Do you know what our enemies say every night in their prayers? They say, "Please, God, keep the English from getting excited for one more year... and we shall never need your help again. " Oh, for goodness sake. Let's talk about something cheerful. Oh, come on now. We've never had jitters in this old house... and we're not going to start this evening. Roger's right. We know where we stand now, and thank heaven for that. Now let's go in before the soup gets cold. He's really looking remarkably well when you think of all the hard work he's been doing. - Will you have coffee in here, sir, or in the library? - In the library, Parsons. - Port? - No, thank you. - Parsons. - Yes, sir? - Did Miss Prudence tell you what had delayed her? - No, sir. Your her father, Roger. It's no concern of mine, but if you want my opinion... Prudence is not behaving in a manner befitting her position. Yesterday afternoon, she took Bert Higgins, the gardener, for a drive in her car... instead of attending Lord Evesham's charity party. Bert Higgins is convalescing. I took out his appendix last month. Well, that doesn't confer special privileges. I remember taking out Lord Evesham's appendix a year ago. Do you know it was exactly like Bert's? Yes, that's a ridiculous argument. We don't shake hands with each other's appendixes. Or is it appendices? I'm not against equality. I'm perfectly prepared to be equal with anybody... providing they don't start being equal with me. Grandfather, I'm terribly sorry. I know I'm awfully late. - That's all right. - Good evening, everybody. Do you mind if I don't change? Of course not. We thought you'd been captured... by one of those German parachute fellows. Bring Miss Prudence her dinner, Parsons. - What have you been up to? - I got delayed in Gosley. I had so many things to do. - Things to do in Gosley? - Yes, I had my hair done and- You mean you drove 15 miles in wartime to have your hair done? Oh, I had a lot of other things to do at the same time. I did some shopping, and I had my hair done, and then I joined the WAAFs. You joined the what? The WAAFs- the Women's Auxiliary Air Force. We hadn't even heard you'd applied for a commission. Oh, I didn't apply for a commission. I joined the ranks. My dear Prudence, why on earth didn't you tell me? I could have arranged for you to be an officer. But I don't want to be an officer till I've learned to be a private. Are you aware that Annie Smith, who scrubs the schoolhouse floors... joined the WAAFs as a private? Yes, I told her she ought to. For generations, the Cathaways have been leaders, Prudence, not followers. In joining this woman's army, you are throwing aside certain, shall I say... traditions that have always entitled the Cathaways to lead. Quite possibly she was thinking of something else. What exactly are you suggesting, Aunt Iris? I'm suggesting nothing, my dear. I'm merely facing the fact that some of you girls of today... would do almost anything in the world to be different. You think it clever to be different, even at the expense of your own family. When you and Uncle Willfred talk, I seem to hear words... oozing from the holes of a moth-eaten sofa. - Prudence, remember where you are. - I do remember where I am! I'm in 1940, and you're in 1880. You and people like you are a worse danger to us than Hitler is. Yes, I mean it. One day we may thank Hitler for some of the things he's done to wake us up... but we'll never look back and thank you. You believe that 40 million people exist in England to make you comfortable. You hate this war, because you knock your shins in a blackout. You grumble about it, because it deprives you of your favorite German bath salts. And what's more, you fear it, because the common men who are doing the fighting... may suddenly begin to doubt the importance of risking their lives... to keep the Uncle Willfreds and the Aunt Irises an immortal part of England. - Give me a glass of sherry, will you, Parsons? - Yes, Miss Prudence. - Shall we go into the library? - Yes. - Are you joining us, Father? - Yes. Yes, shall we? - Coming, Roger? - Certainly. We had some excellent chocolate meringues tonight. I shouldn't miss them if I were you. I'm afraid I was rather rude, Parsons. On the contrary, Miss Prudence. If I may say so, it had flavor. - Janet Beaton. - Here. - Alice Morgan. - Here. - Rena Smith. - Present. - Jane Lindsay. - Here. - RoseJohnson. - Here. - Prudence Cathaway. - Here. - Violet Worthing. - Present. Red tape, that's what it is. They can see we're here without calling out all them names. - You live in Gosley? - No, I live across the Downs, near Walsham. I'm local. Do you know any boys around here? - No, I- I don't. - You leave that to me. I'll fix you up. All right, come through here. Bring your bags. - Name? - Alice Webb. - Size? - Fourteen. - Fourteen. - Fourteen. - Name? Size? - Janet Walker. - Twelve. - Twelve. - How's that? - You look like a colonel. Wish I looked as well. You? If I'm a colonel, you're a full-blown field marshal. - Got a lipstick? - Yes, I think so. - Here you are. - Thanks. - Think we're gonna like it here? - I'm sure we are. - What's your hut number? - Twenty-seven. Fine. That's mine too. How about trying for a nice corner together, eh? - What's your name? - Me? - Violet-Violet Worthing, ma'am. - Take off that lipstick. You're in the army now, and makeup doesn't go with uniforms. I'm sorry, I'm sure. I didn't know. - Do you mind? - Oh, no, not at all. That's me and Joe. Oh, isn't he good looking? - Joe's all right. He's gonna propose to me. - Good for you. - You married? - No. - Promised? - No, not yet. Well, look, Joe's picking me up at 8:00 tonight. I'll give him a ring and get him to bring along a boy for you. Well, maybe some other night. Joining up's enough to start with. - You ain't a blue-stocking? - Oh, I should hope not. All recruits fall in at once on the parade groundsl - Number one marker, fall in. - Number two marker, fall in. Number one squad, fall in. Swings those arms. Hut, two, three, four. Left. One, two. One, two. One, two. And stop. Gas mask drill, by numbers. One. Two. Three. Center those eye pieces. Heads well up. Tighten those tabs. Yes, steady, steady. Heads well up. Breathe slowly. - Prue, whatcha doin' tonight? - Nothing. Why? I'll tell you later. Wait for me. It's ever so important. Company, halt! Left turn! - Well, what is it? - Oh, it's Joe. He's joining the navy tomorrow, and tonight's the last chance he's got to propose to me. But I thought he'd proposed the other night. Oh, well, I didn't want to tell you before... but eight weeks I've been walking out with him, wet and fine. I've never got him so close as I did the other night, Prue. He was putting grass down me neck, like he always does when he's on the point of something. He'd just started to ask me when the air-raid siren went. Oh, I could have killed those blasted Germans up there. Well, you've still got tonight, Vi. Ain't a hope, unless we do something. Look, he calls up this morning to say he's bringing a chum with him. - Whatever for? - Oh, because he's Joe, that's why. He loves me, right enough, Prue, but he's just scared stiff of marrying... so he brings along a chum to walk between us... so he can go away tomorrow and join the navy... - and enjoy it all by himself. - Come on, Vi. - Prue, would you do something for me? - Anything. Come out with me tonight. Come out and takeJoe's chum away, will you? - But, Vi, I don't even know him. - Violet Worthing. Oh, there you are. You're on duty in the mess hut. They've been looking for you everywhere. Hurry. Coming. Eight o'clock tonight then. You won't let me down, Prue. I know you won't. - Joyce Wynn. - All right. - Joyce Wynn. - All right. - Alice Morgan. - Yes. - Prudence Cathaway. - All right. - Violet Worthing. - Yes. - Janet Gleason. - All right. - Where are they? - They must be up here somewhere. - Is that you, Vi? - Oh, there they are. - Joe, is that you? - Yeah, we're here. This is my chum, Prue Cathaway. She thought she'd like a walk- Oh, that's fine. Three's an odd number and four's a nice party for the pictures. - This is my chum, Clive Briggs. - Pleased to meet you, Mr. Briggs. - Well? - Well, let's go. Who wants the pictures? Do you, Prue? Well, I- I think I'd rather be outdoors at a night like this. I know. Let's all go for a stroll downtown... and have a nice beer and bloater at the Fighting Cocks. Oh, come on, Joe. This ain't a Cook's tour all trouping around in a bunch. Mr. Briggs and Prue don't want us hanging around any more than we want them. See you back here at 10:00. Be good, you two. There's a concert at the camp tonight. Would you like to go? If you want to. L- I really don't care. Well, perhaps you'd rather walk. It really doesn't matter. Is this what you usually do when you come out like this? I don't usually come out like this. Oh, I beg your pardon. - You're a very superior sort of WAAF, aren't you? - I'm not in the least superior. If you really want to know, I came to help a friend. Or didn't you realize thatJoe and Violet happen to be in love? No, I didn't. To be honest with you, I'm not the least interested in Joe or Violet. Look. They're bombing Dover. Or is it Canterbury? No, it's farther north. Over the Thames Estuary. I think they're going right through to London. They'll be bombing our camp one of these days. Don't worry. They're not gonna waste bombs on a WAAF camp. Why not? My dear girl, don't you realize that a big bomb costs a thousand pounds? We could go around the world on the price of one bomb. We'd need one each to do it well. Seems a waste, doesn't it? Bang goes another trip around the world. - Cigarette? - Oh, thank you. What's the English aristocracy doing in the ranks of the WAAFs? I don't know what you mean. I seem to recognize the proud voice that lords it over the patient British people. Are you one of the aristocracy haters? I neither hate them nor admire them. I ignore them. Oh, that must be terrible for them. Even if I did belong to what you call the "aristocracy"... have you any objection to my being in the ranks of the WAAFs? No, I have no objection. I only thought that the ranks might. Oh, they're quite broad-minded, you know. In fact, they're a very nice lot of girls. Oh, they're all right, I expect. But just putting them in uniform doesn't turn them intoJoan of Arcs, you know. You don't believe in girls in uniform. You don't believe in very much, do you? I believe in people who know what they're doing and where they're going. You're bitter about something, aren't you? Well, the show seems to be over. We'd better be moving on. Moving on? That sounds like a gypsy. Or a vagabond. Come on. Let's go. Well, here we are. I'm sorry. I didn't get your name. Prudence. Prudence Cathaway. Prudence. Well, good night, Miss Cathaway. - That you, Clive? - Oh, here we are, Joe. - Are you there, Prue? - Yes. Well, good night, old girl. - I'll write regular. - Take care of yourself, Joe. Thanks awfully, Alec. I did have a lovely time. See you Sunday for dinner, Ted. Mother's expecting you. Good night, Tom. Well, it seems that everyone- - Good-bye. - Uh, shall I see you again? - Oh, I don't know. - How about Saturday in the afternoon? Well, I can't promise. I may be busy. - I'll wait for you down at the river. - Suppose I- I can't get away? If you can't, it won't make any difference. At least you tell the truth. Good night. - Good night. - You're a fine one, leaving a chap in the lurch. That other girl had a nerve, bustin' in like that. What was she like? - Webb. - Present. - Cathaway. - Present. - Worthing. - Present. - Stone. - Here. - Walker. - Here. - Banning. - Present. - Shannon. - Here. - All right. Thank you. Good night. - Good night. Prue, I'll never be able to thank you for what you did tonight. - Don't be silly, Vi. - It worked out fine. I didn't even have to ask him. It came quite natural. - I'm glad. He looked awfully nice. - I knew you'd like him. - Oh, what was that chum ofJoe's like? - Oh, he was all right. I couldn't see him in the dark, but he smelt clean. - Good night, Prue. - Good night, Vi. Hello. I'm sorry I'm late. I had an awful time getting away. - Oh, that's all right. I'm glad you came. - Have you been waiting long? No, I, uh, just arrived myself. So you're the girl I met in the dark. Yes, here I am. Shall we go for a walk? All right. - Just a second. - I say, miss- Enough to drive a poor woman crazy, feeding the whole army single-handed. - I say, miss, table for two. - Table for two? He has a hope, he has. Table for two. - Miss, two poached eggs, please. - Poached eggs? Every time I pass that chump's table he shouts, "poached eggs. " Just a minute. I'll be there in a second. Waitress. Waitress. - Well, what do you want? - Waitress, do you remember me? - Yes, what is it? - It was a long, long time ago. - Where's my jam tart? - You've had your jam tart. Didn't you see me give her a tart? You took it away to take the fly off, and you ain't brought it back. - Oh, that tart! Rosie. - Yes? - Where's that jam tart I gave you? - Coming up. - Please, miss- - Grown-up woman can't take a fly off a tart. What is it? - Well, we've already given our order, but- - Well, why didn't you say so? Tiresome people. What is it you wanted? Jam tarts! - Waitress. - Yes, don't get excited. I'll be with you in a minute. Here, Mrs. O'Hallihan. - There you are There's your jam tart. - Thank you. - What's the matter? Where you going? - We'll come back another time. - Thanks just the same. - Well, what do you think of that? They take a table and keep it for half an hour, then they just walk out. Here you are, two. Oh, Clive. Banbury cakes! Do you mind if I have some? - Not at all. Go ahead. - May I have four, please? Ever since I was a child, I could never pass a Banbury cake in cold blood. - Never mind. I'll get it. How much is it? - One shilling, please. - There we are. - Thank you. - Right. - Thank you. What's that? Just lightning. Well, what do the boys and girls do under these conditions? Depends on who they are and how they feel. Some get into hollow trees. Others go to a cinema or a tea shop. Well, we've been to a tea shop. I expect all the hollow trees are full by now. - That only leaves us the cinema. - Do you think we can eat Banbury cakes in a cinema? We can try. Come on. - 6:30. - Well, that settles that. - What happens now? - Shall we go back to the tea shop? No, please. I'd rather be drowned than suffocated. - I'd better get back to the camp. - But it's not 6:00 yet. It's half a mile to the bus. We can't very well swim over. - I suppose we ought to wait here. - Look. The Albion Temperance and Commercial Hotel. Come on. Good afternoon. We'd like a room, please. - Certainly, sir. Pa? Pa? - What is it? - There's a lady and gentleman wants a room. - Huh? - Hello. - Well, what do you want? We'd like a room where we can have a fire lit and dry these things and have tea sent up. Eh? We don't have no room. - But the girl just said- - I don't care what she said. I say we don't have no room. This ain't the sort of place you want, boy. I've me reputation to keep up. Reputation! I'd say you have, you dirty, little pip-squeak. What you need is to open the windows and let the smell out... then open your mind and let the smell out of that. Get me the police station, Emily. I'll show you there's still order and decency in this country-war or no war. Clive, let's go. Emily, go down to your mother. I'll call up myself. Hello. You're very nice. Think you can go where you want and do what you want. Coming into a respectable placel Here, get me the- Fares, please. All fares, please. Oh, Gosley Camp, please. Two. We don't pass Gosley Camp, sir. You want number 17. What? He says we want a number 17. - Where do we get a number 17? - At the crossroads, miss. - You get one takes you right past the camp gate. - Thanks. Next one goes by at 7:20. - Which way do we go? - Haven't the faintest idea. Look, we can watch for the bus and keep dry at the same time. Come on. Well, this has been a great day. Crowded out of a tea shop, shut out of a cinema, thrown out of a hotel and turned out of a bus. One feels the warm heart of England. You're shivering. No, I'm all right. Have a Banbury cake. No, thanks. I think I'd prefer something that blends a little more neatly with the weather. - What's that? - Whiskey. Have some? Help the Banburys down. - Never touch it. - Go on, do you good. Oh, always take the cork out of a bottle before you hand it to a lady. Especially when it's a lady in a haystack. Go ahead. Don't be afraid. How's that? Good. Did you ever get stinko- blind, unconscious stinko? - No. Have you? - Mm-hmm. Two nights ago. Blind, blotto, out. - Why? - Why not? Well, people generally have good reasons for getting blind, blotto, out, don't they? Yes, I suppose so. Tell me. What's it like living in a WAAF camp? It's like a clock winding up, hour after hour... the spring getting tighter and tighter until you feel that if you- if you see any more women or hear any more women, you're going to burst out screaming. You've just got to talk to a man sometimes- any man- anything with a pair of trousers on. Oh, I'm anything with a pair of trousers on? I didn't mean that. You know, the other night when I met you... I couldn't see anything, but I knew exactly what you'd look like in the daylight. What do I look like? Oh, you're rather good looking, really. Nice sort of face. Nose a little on the fine side. Mouth a little too big. One of your ears sticks out a little more than the other. - Did you know your face is slightly lopsided? - Now wait just a minute. But your eyes are good. A nice, deep brown. A little tired-looking. Late hours, perhaps, huh? - You're better than a smack in the lug yourself. - What's a smack in the lug? Mmm. An old friend of mine named Monty. If he says you're better than a smack in the lug, it means you're all right. - Let's don't start that. - I'm not starting anything. I just said you were all right. That's a perfectly decent, respectable thing to say. Here, you're still cold. You'd better have a little more. Mm-mmm. I wanted to ask you, why aren't you in uniform? Come on. Just a little one. Well, will you tell me when I get stinko- blind stinko? I'll be delighted, madam. - Don't feel anything yet. - You will. Don't worry. No, really. I feel quite clear. It just makes me want to talk. That's all. I may not look it, but I'm tough. I can take it. You know, last Christmas I had three glasses of port, and then I won a Ping-Pong match. You know, I- I didn't tell the truth just then. I... do feel stinko. Quite stinko, in fact. Don't look at me like that. Kiss me. Squad, halt! Left turn! Stand at ease! The bus will be here in five minutes. You can put your kit bags over by the gate and stand nearby. Attention! Dismissl Prue. Prue. - Somebody's asking for you over by the stile. - For me? - Yes. Go on. I'll look after your bag. - Thanks. - Hello. - Hello. I hear you're leaving today. - Yes, we're going to Boxgrove. - You look so beautiful. - I haven't changed. - You're so honest, so real. Well, here's the bus. I must go. - How long will you be away? - Three weeks. - Three weeks? - Is that such a long time? - Well, no, it's just- - You'll be gone? No, I'll be here, Prue. I promise I will. You know, Clive, when I get back, I'll be due for leave. You will? Let's go away then. I know a good hotel on the seacoast of Leaford. Oh, I'm afraid I can't. I have to go home. I promised to. - Clive, come home with me. - Me? To the ancestral home of the Cathaways? It's not so far from here to Walsham. We'll take the Tunbridge train. The pride of the family bringing home the man she found in the dark. - You're not funny. - I've never been more serious. - Prue? Prue, quick. - I must go. Good-bye. Good-bye, Prue. And remember, you're coming with me to Leaford. I'll drop you a card when I get back with the time of the train to Tunbridge. - You mean Leaford. - Tunbridge. Good-bye. Leaford train. And Leafordl Oh, could you tell me what platform does the train for Tunbridge leave from? Number three, sir. Four twenty-seven. Five minutes' time. Thank you. Would you keep an eye on my bag, please? Certainly, sir. Take your seats, please. Tunbridge train. Porter. Porter, could you tell me where the Leaford train goes from? Number five, miss, over the bridge. You better hurry, miss. We'll be leaving in five minutes. Take your seats, please. Tunbridge train- - Here's an empty one, miss. - No, thank you. Come along now. Take your seats for Tunbridge. Take your seats, please. - Prue. - Clive! - I've been looking for you. Where are you going? - Well- - I was going to Tunbridge. - You mean Leaford. We'd better hurry or we'll miss the other one too. Well, I suppose some people would call this fate. Think of them at home. My first leave. There they are, running up the flags, rolling out the red carpet... and here am I going in the opposite direction with a tall, dark stranger. You've made that stranger very happy though, and very proud. - That's a comfort. - I'm not joking. I'm sorry. I've never seen you with your cap off before. Honey top. - Whoopl I beg pardon. - Oh, that's all right. Come in. Sorry, sir, but I have to punch the tickets, come what may. - There we are. - Thank you, sir. - Thank you. - You're on the wrong train, miss. - Right train, wrong ticket. - Well, there was a mistake. - How far are you going? - How far are we going? - Leaford. - Pay the difference at the junction. Oh, just a moment. Could we be alone in here? - Eh? - I say, could we be alone in here? Well, it's against the rules, but well, I was in the last war meself. Thank you. Don't forget, miss, you still have to pay the difference. There are still some human beings left in the world. He's quite a character, isn't he? You know, it's hot in here. - Would you do me a favor? - Anything you ask, sir. Could you change into something less official? That is, if you have anything else in that bag. Yes, if you want me to. But what's wrong with the uniform? Isn't it rather warlike for a holiday? Can't we forget the war and everything about the war for six days? Seven days, really. Six nights and seven days. All Sunday, all Monday, all Tues- Mm-mmm. Now you can look out of the window. Country's beautiful, isn't it? Oh, superb. We're just passing a watercress farm. Did you know you can grow mustard and cress on old bits of flannel? One of our gardeners used to do it. One of your gardeners? How many gardeners, precisely, do you have? - We had five. - Five? And I suppose when you were a child you had six nurses and 10 rocking horses. What on earth do you want five gardeners for? We didn't want them. Our garden did. Five! Well, I suppose that's one of the privileges of the idle rich. You talk like one of those Hyde Park tub-thumpers who goes in for class hatred. If a man owns a chain of tea shops and employs a hundred girls... oh, that's fine- That's enterprise. But if he owns a country place and employs five gardeners to grow food... that's the aristocracy grinding the faces of the poor. We're always reading about this blessed land- this England. But who do you suppose keeps this blessed land in decent condition... if it isn't the poor, tax-bled landowners? Oh, I hear the voice of England- the good, old England that loves its horses and its cows and sheep because- because they never ask for a raise in pay. I'm not going to argue with you. Mmm, here. Hold this a minute, will you? You talk about the idle rich. My goodness. You just try being rich and idle at the same time with taxes to the sky. Oh, I wish I had some better things. I left them all behind to be Spartan and businesslike till the war's over. You should feel honored, sir. I'm wearing one of my last pairs of silk stockings for you. Sorry I'm taking such a long time. I suppose you're getting tired of looking at all those cows and sheep... that never ask for a raise in pay. All right, you needn't admire the countryside any longer. Throw me that belt, will you? Thank you. Well? Well? You're very pretty. Taller... - slimmer, cooler. - What's the matter? And a stranger. I met WAAF in the dark, and I haven't a gardener to my name. Why do you punish yourself, Clive? You worry about how big is our house, how much land we've got. And when I tell you, you look as though a fireproof curtain had come down between us. What does it matter? Nothing matters. We're on a holiday for six long, wonderful days, and you're very beautiful. Oh, that's better. Just a moment ago, I was only pretty. Now I'm beautiful. We're getting on very nicely, aren't we? Pay the taxi, please. Those two bags. - Clive. - Yes? I just want to say that I haven't been so happy for a long time. Come on. Hold that taxi. Party for the station. Good afternoon. I have a reservation. Mr. Clive Briggs. Just a moment. Briggs. Briggs. We've reserved a nice double room on the first floor, sir. Oh, we'd prefer two rooms. Do you have two nice ones? The best, sir. Be 214 and 216. - Both facing the sea, sir. Will that be all right? - That'll be fine, yes. Will you please sign the register? - Porter, 214, 216, second floor. - Yes, sir. Shall I open the bag, madam? No, thank you. Just leave it there. Sea air, sunshine, if you're lucky. Clear view of the Germans in Calais on a fine day. What more can man desire? - You tired? - No, I'm all right. - What's the matter? - Nothing. Look here. If you've suddenly changed your mind, why don't you say so? - You're free to do whatever you like. - You wanted me to come here. Well, here I am! So please stop asking me what I want to do. What's happened? You were happy enough on the train. I know. L- I just didn't realize. I'm sorry. Liqueur brandy, sir? - Liqueur brandy? - No, thank you. No, thank you. You're not very full up just now, are you? No, sir. We kept up very well this season until the Germans took Calais. If you'll excuse me, sir, I'll turn on the news. The loudspeaker's in the lounge... but you can hear perfectly at this table. Shall we have a walk, get some fresh air? But don't you want to listen to the news? Can't we forget that for one night? This is the Herman-Foster's program. Bruce Leighton speaking. Here is the 9:00 news. London. The Air Ministry announces that at 6:30 this evening a large formation of enemy aircraft... was sighted over the Thames Estuary. Our fighters immediately- I used to know a little place at the back of the town. It'll be more friendly than the hotel, if you'd care to walk over. No, I don't think so, Clive. I feel rather tired. I think I'll go back. Prue? Have you made up your mind about tomorrow? You still want to leave? Yes. Come on. You can't stay here. I'm right. I tell you, I'm right. Come on. Don't you see? There aren't any more. That's no good. Get out of there. Get out of there. What are you waiting for? It's no use. No, don't. - Yes? - Your bath's ready, sir. Thank you. - Was the water all right, madam? - Fine, thanks. Well, sir, they were over Portsmouth again last night I hear. I must say, we are very lucky. Touch wood. - Hot milk, sir? - No, thank you. Good morning, Clive. Sorry. I had some shopping to do. - Shopping? - Mm-hmm. Oh, it's a lovely morning. We've some very nice grilled mushrooms this morning and the last of the Danish bacon. Or perhaps you'd like a nice Dover sole? - No, nothing, thanks. I'd just like some coffee. - Coffee, yes, madam. I bought this for you. - For me? - Yes. Open it. Go on. I thought perhaps you'd-you'd like it. Prue. You looked so funny walking down the passage... in your little, shriveled up overcoat and those bare legs. I used to have one, you know. I left it somewhere. I don't remember. You shouldn't have troubled, Prue. It wasn't any trouble. Did you sleep well last night? Yes, very. Did you? - Quite, thanks. - Telegram, sir. - For me? - Yes, sir. - The bags are down, madam, at the porter's desk. - Thank you. More coffee? Yes, please. I told them to bring the bags down. Thanks. I'm terribly sorry about last night. I understand. No, you don't. The fact is, I- I nearly ran into my Aunt Iris. - Your what? - Aunt Iris. It's funny how romantic a thing like this can be when nobody knows about it. And then suddenly, how... sordid and shabby it all seems when an aunt appears. You mean you're leaving just because of your Aunt Iris? - Yes, I suppose so. - Anything else, sir? - No, thanks. - Thank you, sir. We've lots of time before the train goes, and it's a lovely morning out. Won't you show me that little place you told me about last night? Why, yes, of course, if you'd care to. Well, well, well, well, well, if it isn't Mr. Briggs. Well, this is a surprise, sir. - Mr. Ramsbottom, Miss Cathaway. - How do you do, miss? Miss Cathaway wanted to see the Coach and Horses. - It's lovely. Is it very old? - Old, miss? My great-grandfather was stable boy... when Lord Nelson stopped here one night on his way to Portsmouth. Did you ever see a carp that size? That's 38 pounds. My father took that out of the Arun River on his 82nd birthday... the day before Queen Victoria died. - Really? - Yes, he did indeed, miss. - Hubert! Hubert. - Yes, sir. - Two places for Mr. Briggs. - Yes, sir. How about- How about a nice drop of brown sherry before lunch? Don't you think we ought to start back, Clive? It's past 12:00. There's still plenty of time. It's only five minutes from here to the station. I had hardly known you, Mr. Briggs. You look so much better. Seems no time at all since you were here last. What's happened? Aren't- Could you ring the Grand Hotel and ask them to send our bags, please? Certainly, sir. Aggy? Aggy? Ring up the Grand Hotel and ask them to send Mr. Briggs's bags over. Right you are, sir. The middle window table has got to their cheese, sir. They'll be gone in about 15 minutes. - Clive, don't you think we'd better go? - Don't you worry, miss. We're not going to have Mr. Briggs waiting for any 15 minutes. - You just come along with me. Aggy. - Yes, sir. - Is number two room been cleaned up yet? - Yes, sir. I done it meself. Good. This way, please. You came on the right day, Mr. Briggs. - A nice Michaelmas goose with applesauce. - Fine. Cauliflower- Coach and Horses's style. Cheshire cheese and plum tart with junket and a drop of cream. - Cream in wartime? - Shh! What's that? Just the lift, miss. Every convenience for our guests. It's quite a novelty. Goes from here right down into the kitchen. Mrs. Grubble. Two goose, Cheshire cheese and plum tart for two. Well, well, well, here we are. Here's something that I hope you haven't forgotten about, Mr. Briggs. - Oh, the mulled special. - The mulled special it is, sir. Now how could I forget about that? Just wait till you try this. There. Well, how is it, miss? Strong. It's delicious. Special to the house, miss. A secret formula dating back to the old smuggling days. Well, luncheon immediately. Aggy. - Aggyl. - To Mr. Ramsbottom. - To Mr. Ramsbottom. - Oh, he's perfect. He might have come straight out of a Dickens story. Yes, that's where he probably found himself. I suppose he's just conforming to the popular opinion of what he ought to be like. We all do that in one way or another. What's worrying you, Clive? Me? Nothing. You told me you slept well last night, didn't you? I did. Why? - I heard talking in your room and I wondered- - Talking? - Yes. - It was probably the man in the next room. There wasn't any man in the next room. It's all right if you don't want to tell me, but I- I know there's something. There's nothing. - Cigarette? - Thank you. What's the wire? Secret? No. You can read it if you care to. "Wangled 24 hours leave. Coming down for binge. Monty. " Who's Monty? Oh, he's a friend of mine. You'll like him. "Better than a smack in the lug. " Wasn't that Monty? Yes, that's Monty. I'll wire him back. We'll meet somewhere else. Will you be going back to Gosley from here? I may. I don't know yet. Here you are, sir. Ooh. And Mr. Ramsbottom asked me to tell you... they're sending your bags round right away. - Never mind. We'll do that. - Oh, well, I think that's everything, sir. If there's anything you want, sir, would you pull this bell? One pull if there's something else you need, and two pulls for when you're finished. All right. Thank you. Why didn't we stay here instead of that awful Grand Hotel? Well, this didn't seem quite the place somehow for- for people with five gardeners. How silly you are. You didn't tell me you'd stayed here before. I didn't stay here. I used to drop in some evenings. Were you working down here or something? No, not exactly. Would the gentleman like his coffee served in the drawing room? Not until we've finished this priceless nectar. - To the memory of the happiest lunch I've ever had. - We've ever had. Ah, I'm beginning to feel awfully happy. So am I. I'm afraid we're going to get stinko again. Oh, I like this place. It's good luck to us. We don't quarrel here. It was awfully good of you to give me that dressing gown. There was another one with a velvet collar, only I didn't think you'd like it as well. I'd like to tell you how grateful I am, but I- I don't quite know how. - There's no need to, Clive. - No, I really must. I must tell you what all the love poems in the world have tried to say and failed. That of all the things on earth, God has made no more exultant... more beautiful, more noble a thing than- than a man and woman who truly love each other... and are willing to fight the world for what they believe in. That's what all the poets have tried to say and never have. Those must have been wonderful drinks. No, Prue, I'm afraid it isn't the drinks. Do you really believe that about poetry and two people in love? Yes. It's one of the things I really believe. Do you think it's true? If two people are very, very lucky. Are we very, very lucky? I hope we are. Here's the man with your bags, sir. Sent around from the Grand Hotel, sir. - That'll be a shilling to pay, sir. - All right. There you are. - Thank you. - Thank you, sir. Well, we'd better go. It's nearly 1:00. I suppose we ought to ring for the bill. Oh, yes. What was it the maid told us? One pull if we wanted anything else. Two when we'd finished. Well, that's two then. Do you believe in omens? No, I never have... until now. Neither have I. Come in. - Did you ring, Mr. Briggs? - Yes. Is this room to let? - It is, sir. The gentlemen only moved out this morning. - Do you have another one? No, sir, I'm afraid there- Wait a minute, sir. We certainly have and a very interesting one too, sir. Well, what do you think of that, sir? They say it's an old smuggler's hiding place. This way, please. Mind the steps, miss. Mind your head, sir. Well, Mr. Briggs, how do you like that? We can have it cleaned up in no time. - Oh, it's splendid. - Good. I'll send the girl up right away, sir. Thank you. Oh, I should like to live here for the rest of my life. There was a cold blight on that hotel. I'm glad we started badly. Now when we start again, it's like- like having two holidays instead of one. It's no good. Come on. You don't want to die here. Don't. You can't. I know what you're thinking, but I'm right. I'm rightl Don't. You can't. I'm right. I know I'm right. Don't. Don't. Don't. - Who's that? - It's Prue. What is it? - You were calling out. - Calling out, was I? - What is it, Clive? Why can't you tell me? - What was I saying? You were calling out orders. Don't worry, Prue. I'm all right. It's just sometimes when I'm not very well- - Is there anything I can do? - No, no, no. It's- Sometimes when I'm overtired, I talk in my sleep. I'm sorry I woke you. - Would you like to stay until you're asleep? - No, no, no, I'm all right. Really, it's nothing. - Good night. - Good night. - Clive? - Yes? You were in the army, weren't you? Yes. Why didn't you tell me? Why should I? We're on a holiday. And anyway, I'm out of it now. Were you wounded? No, I was- I was ill. Is that all? Listen, I hear planes. Don't worry. They're ours. How can you tell? By the sound. I'd say there were about half a dozen, flying quite low. You learned that in France. - Please, Prue. - What was it like, Clive? You won't be satisfied till I tell you, will you? Well, it was hell- dirty, foul, disgusting. Do you want any more? - No, not if you feel like that. - How'd you expect me to feel? - Proud. - Proud? I'm proud because you were there. But you said you were out of it now. What was that? Shrapnel. Some of our own. Every shell bursts into a thousand pieces... and every piece comes down again by the laws of gravitation. Come here. I'm afraid I- I'm not very brave. You are brave, and you're very, very beautiful. It's funny. Suppose a bomb dropped. Suppose I were killed and they found me here... in this room with a strange man. I shouldn't let you down. I'd go into your room. But suppose you were killed, both of us, just as we are now? - Then we'd both be dead, and we wouldn't care a hang. That was a bomb. The closer it is, the safer we'll be from now on. It's a million to one against two bombs landing in the same spot. It was worse than this at Dunkirk, wasn't it? - No. - It was- a hundred times worse. Clive? - Yes? - I'm so glad you were there. Is that all you're glad about? No, it's- it's just one thing... I didn't quite understand. Quite a remarkable thing, sir. One of those little phenomenons of nature. It certainly is. But did they do any damage? Direct hit on the old skating rink, sir. But as the town council were going to put it down this winter anyhow... the Luftwaffe saved the taxpayers a hundred pounds. All right, sir, take it away. These eggs ought to taste fine, sir, after what's just happened. Out of evil cometh good. You'd better be careful of these eggs. They're very special. - Oh? What's excited Mr. Ramsbottom? - The air raid. He tells me he has 12 chickens, and every one of them laid an egg when the bomb went off. Come in. There's a gentleman here to see you. That's the first time I've been called a gentleman since I joined the army. - What cheer of the old cock robin? - Monty. Oh, sorry, Nipper. They never told me you had company. Come along in. We didn't expect you down quite so early. - This is Prudence Cathaway. My friend Monty. - Pleased to meet you, miss. Good morning. Won't you sit down, Mr. - You might just as well call me Monty, miss. Everybody else does. Little bit of all right, this. - Would you care to have something? - No, thanks, miss. You see, I had my lunch around 1:00. Well, you'll be wanting to get dressed, Prue. Don't you mind me, miss. Look, Monty, as a matter of fact, this is her room. Oh, sorry, miss. My mistake. - Come along. See where I sleep. - Oh. - Did you have a nice trip down? - Aye, I'll say I did. - There were two marines on the train and a commercial traveler. - Mind your head. We got the civvy into poker and squeezed him every pot. I made enough to pay for the whole trip down and back. Hey, have you got any ghosts in here? No, this is where the old smugglers used to hide. Sit down. - I'll bet you got beetles, though. - Beetles? There's always beetles under these old roofs. Sorry, Nipper. I put my foot right in it that time. - Did you bring her down with you or find her here? - She came with me, of course. Aye. I might have guessed that. Accidents like that don't happen so neat. She's a nice girl. - Oh, she's a nice girl, sure. - Well, she is! Well, I said so, didn't I? Oh, come off it, Nipper. I was not born yesterday. No more were you. You don't have to make excuses. - How long is your leave, Monty? - Twenty-four hours. Take the first train up in the morning. - We'll have to have a talk, Nipper. - All right. - How much does she know? - Look, Monty. You said you'd come down here for a binge. - Well, I had to say something, didn't I? - All right, we'll have our binge. - Come on. Have a drink. - Okay. Yes? - Can we come through? - Come on. We'll be at the bar, Prue. Would Mr. Montague care to have lunch with us, Clive? - Of course. - On one condition, little lady. - Dinner tonight on yours truly. - Lovely. - Well, she did not think so much of me, does she? - She will... if you stop thinking she's what you're thinking. Okay, Nipper. I'll treat her as if she were a bloomin' society debutante. Then you'll be treating her for exactly what she is. #And then you've bitten off # # Much more than you can chew # # Come on Hold your hand out # #We're all fed up with you # # Cor blimey # #Adolf, you toddle off and all your Nazis too # # Or you may get something to remind you # # Of the old red, white and blue # #We're sick of all the fuddle and the mess you've made # Go ahead. See if you can find a table, Monty. - I'll get the drinks. What'll you have, Prue? - Gin and French. - Pint of the old and mild for me, nipper. - Right. - Come on, little lady. We'll dance across. - Love to. #Adolf, you've bitten off much more than you can chew # # Come on Hold your hand out # #We're all fed up with you # # Cor blimey ## Hey, fellas, look who's here! Monty! - Monty, old boy. - How are you, Monty? Come and sit down. - How are you, Monty? - Good. Hello. Oh, here, miss. I want to introduce some of the boys in the East Kent Fusiliers. How do you do, miss? Not bad, eh. Not bad, eh. - Don't you think we ought to make sure of that table over there? - Aye, miss. - I'll see you later, boys. - Don't you worry about that, Monty. We'll be there, all right. Oh, that's a bit of all right, ain't it? - Somethin' I've been wantin' to tell you, miss. - Yes? Sorry I crashed into your room this morning. If I'd known you were there I wouldn't have come in. - Oh, that's all right. - It's tough on a girl when she's gotta meet her chap's friends. But don't you worry. Don't you judge him on me. He's class, and he's educated. He may not fling it in your face, but he's a real gent. He thinks a lot of you too, Monty. Well, that's because we're in the same crowd. When you work with a bloke, eat, sleep, and drink with 'em for months on end... you either want to shoot 'em or die for 'em. - Were you in France together? - I'll say we were. - Was he-Was he a good soldier? - Was he a good soldier? Let me tell you something. I've been through two wars... and I've seen every sort of man in every sort of trouble. And you can take it from me, miss, the nipper is great. If you could've seen him coming down the road from Arras with ration bags slung over his back... walking into hell and cool as a cucumber... and coming back the very next night and doing it again! You wouldn't have to ask me, "Is he a good soldier?" And I'll tell you something else. He's up for a medal. - He is? - Aye. D.C.M. - For carrying his wounded company officer the last two miles to Dunkirk... and then givin' up his own place in the boat to help the wounded. - If they asked me, I'd make it the V.C. - Tell me about it. Well, it was after the Belgies had thrown up the sponge. Look. Here's the street in Douai... where we were fighting a rear guard action to let the main army through. "Hold Douai to the last man. " That was our orders. - Well, we got to here when theJerry opened fire. - Here. - Clive! - When you two finally win this war, call me. - I'll be at the bar. - Monty was just telling me about the medal. - What medal? - He hasn't heard. You're up for a medal, laddie You're a bloomin' hero. - What are you talking about? - Fact. I had it firsthand from the sergeant major. - Deputation from the East Kent Fusiliers. - Now what's your trouble? We tossed up odd man out for the privilege of asking your lady for a dance... and I was the lucky one. Well, I'm not the lucky one at this table. You're talking to the wrong bloke. Oh, that's all right. Do you mind, Clive? - No. Go ahead. - Oh, thanks. That's very nice. Well, drinks on me, chaps. Well, she's a nice enough girl. Why didn't you keep your mouth shut, Monty? You promised me, didn't you? All right, all right. I didn't start it. She asked me. Asked you what? - Good beer, isn't it? - Yeah, it's all right. Look here, nipper. I hate talking the way I've got to... but time's getting short and this may be our last chance. So we might just as well face it. Absence without leave, that's one thing. But desertion, that's another. You were given a month's sick leave on the 10th ofJuly. Today is the 15th of September. Now, look, nipper. We've been pals for a long time- You might just as well save your breath, Monty. I'm not going back. - Oh, listen to me, nipper. She's a decent enough girl- - She's got nothing to do with it. Nothing! I made up my mind a long time before I met her. Well, if it isn't her, it doesn't make any sense. You must be crazy. Hey, Monty! She dances all right, don't she? Aye, laddie. Let's talk sense, nipper. We've all felt the way you do one time or another. Get so sick and tired we want to clear out and never come back... even if they shoot us. But when the time comes, we always go back. You don't understand, Monty. It's bigger than what you're talking about. It's bigger than me. It's just something that's deep down inside me. Oh, it's got nothing to do with being afraid or sleeping in the mud... or going without food. Well, it doesn't bear talking about. It's just there, and nothing can ever change it. You can't get away with it. It's getting tougher every day... with the military police stopping everyone on the road for his papers. Sure as I'm sitting here, they'll pick you up. The pleasure's all mine, miss. See you later, gents. - Right, laddie. - What were you saying, Monty? Who'll pick who up? Oh, uh, those motorists on the road. If a man's in uniform, they always pick him up and give him a lift. Yes, the war has made people more generous, hasn't it? - Will you dance with me, Clive? - Yes, of course. # Old soldiers never die # # Never die Never die # # Old soldiers never die # # They simply fade away ## Quiet, please. Quiet! Ladies and gentlemen, just a moment. Everyone in this room is singing but one man. One man! Go ahead, Monty. Don't worry about me. You know I can't sing. Ladies and gentlemen, he says he can't sing. I've known the man for two years, and he can sing. We sang this song together before every rank in the army... from field marshal to sanitary squad. - Is that the truth, or not? - Oh, go on, Monty. Get along with it. If you can sing it for all of them, can't you sing it for me, Clive? - All right. - Aye, that's better. Now then, all together. # Old soldiers never die # # Never die Never die # #Old soldiers never die # - Double brandy, please. - Righto, governor. - No more. Not tonight, Clive. No more. Not tonight. You're all the same. The reforming urge-You go halfway and then you start to preach. Give me another one. - Clive. - Yes? - Nothing. #Keep the home fires burning # #While your hearts are yearning # #Though your lads are far away # #They dream of home # - # There's a silver lining # - Shall I put a head on it, lady? - No, thank you. - # Through the dark clouds shining # # Turn the dark clouds inside out # - #Till the boys come home # - Come on, miss. Let's see if you can sing as well as you can dance. Now then, off we go. # Keep the home fires burning # #While your hearts are yearning # # Though your lads are far away # # They dream ofhome # #There's a silver lining # # Through the dark clouds shining # #Turn the dark clouds inside out # # Till the boys come home # Closing time, everybody. Closing time. Time, ladies and gentlemen. Please, time. - #While your hearts are yearning # - Closing time. Ladies and gentlemen, please. #Though your lads are far away # # They dream ofhome # # There's a silver lining ## Well, good night, Miss Prue. Thank you for them dances. Good night, Monty. Thank you for a lovely evening. - Monty- - Do you mind, Miss Prue? I'd like to have a word with Clive. - Of course. - There's just one thing I want to say to you. I had to come back to it again, nipper. You know how the captain feels about you. When he first heard you were overstaying your leave... he thought you were sick and couldn't write. After weeks tryin' to find you, he was still hoping it was something you couldn't help. It was noble of the captain to be troubled about me. Well, one night he sent for me to come to his room. "Monty," he said, "he's your pal. "Find him. Get him here before it's too late. "If he's not here by midnight Monday... "he'll be posted as a deserter, and after that there's nothing we can do. He's too good a man to have his life ruined. " Those are the captain's very words. "Too good a man to have his life ruined. " That's why I want you to come back with me, nipper. Monty, I'm sorry. I've tried to explain. There's nothing more to say. What are you going to do? I don't know. Good night. - Is that you, Clive? - Yes, it's me. The unfailing Mr. Ramsbottom. Barley water. - Have some? - No, thanks. - Help me, will you? - Yes, of course. Monty looked so worried when you said good-bye to him. All evening you've both seemed so mysterious and strange. - Please, Prue. - No, really. While I was dancing, I saw you two leaning across the table... whispering together like a couple of conspirators. Have you two got some horrible secret? Did you rob the church box when you were little boys? Or has one of you a wife and six babies hidden away somewhere? Come on. What is it? It was about a- a friend of Monty's who joined the army the day the war began... because he believed that he was going to fight for something that really mattered. He was ready to fight and willing to die if there was any sense and reason to it. But he didn't find any. He found his leaders stupid, complacent and out-of-date... with no claim to leadership but birth and class and privilege. They weren't leading him in a struggle for a better England. They were leading him in a struggle to preserve the same, rotten, worn-out conditions... that kept their class in comfort and his in poverty. They were asking him to give his life for something that he hated and despised. Is Monty expected to answer this man's problem? Monty had nothing to offer in reply. He might ask him whether it's time to doubt and argue... when his country's fighting for its life. No one believes that England's perfect. We all know we were badly guided and unprepared. But what's the use of whining about the past when we're fighting to survive? What we're fighting for is bigger than he is... bigger than his leaders, bigger than you, Clive, or me. If we lose our faith, what's the alternative? To be beaten in this war would- would be terrible, unthinkable. That's what he's trying to see clearly through this awful confusion. He keeps asking himself, if England were to lose, could we be worse off? Or weaker? Or more shameful? But doesn't he understand? That right or wrong, it's too late to doubt or question. We're in it now, and we've got to go on. Monty should tell his friend there are bigger things to fight for than his conscience. He's told him that. He's told him that he must fight for England. Do you know what England means to this man? It means poverty, hunger, begging for work, no matter how cruel and humiliating. And if our armies did win this war... what share will this man have in the England that he's helped to save? They'll give him nothing! It'll return to the men who have owned it and disgraced it... so that they can go on disgracing it until the next war comes. I don't think that will happen. I hope it won't. But whatever does happen, let us decide it, not the enemy. But you've only told me the things this man's brain... tells him he shouldn't fight for. What about all the things his heart tells him he should fight for? What things? - He must ask his heart. - He doesn't think with his heart. Go ahead. Tell me just a few. All right. I'll-I'll try. If anyone asks me what England is... he-he robs me of an answer because everything it is can't be spoken about. If you do, it's like tearing apart a flower to analyze it. If I said it was Shakespeare and thatched roofs and the countryside, he'd laugh. If I said it was speakers in Hyde Park, free to say what they wish... and polite bobbies at the corners... and those cliffs over there, and Drake alive in memory, he'd laugh again. If I said England was the New Forest deep in ferns and holly trees- If I said it was May blossoms rich in spring and bluebells like a Godsent carpet- the rain and the shine and the green of our blessed land- If I said it was the larks that will sing here tomorrow... high in the sun, tomorrow and forever... or the shout of a newsboy at the corner, the sound of a taxi horn... or the age and dignity of our cities- If I said it was all those things, he'd laugh because words have said it so often before. If I said it was all those things, he'd laugh because words have said it so often before. If I tried to say it was all the things that make the pride and joy... and gentle gladness of our people... I'd use words badly and shame the things themselves by doing so. I couldn't tell him if he won't see beyond the emptiness of words. But I could make him see. England! It's- It's Monty and the boys coming up the road from Douai. It's you, Clive, helping the weaker men into the boats... instead of getting in themselves. Whatever this man is, blood and bone, mind and heart and spirit... England made him, every part of him. Even if he doesn't understand the other things, he would understand that. When he says the word "England," it must be for him as it is for me- like music that's rich beyond the power of music. Those are the things, and he must go back and fight for them... because that's England too- knowing that we'll never be beaten, knowing that we won't give in! We won't! We just won't! I'm sorry, Clive. It's- It's just something I feel so terribly strongly about. Oh, I'm sorry, mum. Excuse me. I thought you was gone too. Gone too? Clive! Clive! "... and I would no more attempt to destroy what you believe... "than I would tell a child that Father Christmas did not exist. "Where I'm going, I don't know, and I don't care. "I'm tired. I want to say how decent you were. "I wish I'd been more decent to you. "Good-bye, and our coming from the darkness... "into the light ofknowing each other was very, very sweet. Shall we meet again after all this is over? I hope so. " Yes? Have you heard anything from Briggs? Sorry, sir. But I'm still hoping. Thank you, Corporal. Yes, go ahead. It's up to you now. Yes. All right. Thank you. Take this down, will you? Clive Briggs, Private, 226567- - Where are you making for, chum? - Next town. Well, I turn off before Petersfield... but I can take you as far as the Bluebridge Crossroads. - Come on. Hop in. - Thanks. - What's that? - A military barrier. They got the wind up- all these parachuting spy scares. Better get your card out. - Where are you for, mate? - Guildford. Identity cards, please. Here, who was that? Hey, where're you going? Hey, come back herel Corporall Corporal of the guard! Turn out the guard! This way! - Who was that? - Don't ask me. I picked him up on the road. Spoke quite decent English too. Come on. This way. Over here. Here, now. What's this? Hey, you! Wake upl What are you doing here? I'm talking to you! What're you doing here? I was just sleeping here. I'm on a walking trip. Where's your haversack? You can go on a walking trip without a haversack. No, you don't! There's a spy scare around here. We got it from the soldiers last night. - You better come along and explain yourself. - Don't be silly. Here, you. What're you trying to do? - Yes? - I'm sorry to trouble you. I've had a slight accident. I don't think it's much, but it doesn't stop bleeding. I wonder if you'd be kind enough to bind it up for me. - All right. Come in. - Thank you. It's silly. I had a fall from my motorbike. Tire burst. - Sit down. I'll be with you in a minute. - Thank you. You really ought to have it stitched. They'd have done it much better at the hospital. Yes, I know. But I hadn't time to find the hospital. - I'm in rather a hurry. - Where'd you say you left your motorcycle? At a garage. They're putting it right. - On the Midhurst Road? - Yes. This is going to hurt a little. Mum! Mum! Did you see them go by, Mum? - Did I see who go by? - The police. There's been a fight, Mum. A spy! Who told you that? They telephoned from Dunston, and Mr. Robinson told the teacher. They found a spy in Mr. Bristow's barn. They had an awful fight, and he got away. Go and get your lunch, Jackie. Oh, yes, Mum. - You, um, hadn't time to find the hospital? - No. It's on the Midhurst Road, half a mile from here. You must've gone right past it. You couldn't have missed it. - Y-Yes, but-but I- - I'm sorry. I'll have to telephone the police. I know what you're thinking. But will you believe me when I tell you that I'm not a spy? Honestly, I'm not. I was sleeping in a barn. A man tried to stop me from leaving. And I had to fight him. That's all. Will you give me just 10 minutes? Then you can do whatever you like. You must have this dressed again. - It really needs a stitch. - Will you give me 10 minutes? There. That's the best I can do. Now, you'd better go. I, uh, wish I could thank you. I've used your bandages and everything. That's all right. It's my duty. - And it's your duty to tell the police? - Yes. - Well, good-bye and thank you again. - Good-bye. Bed number seven. First floor. - How much? - Tenpence. - One night, please. - Bath? - No. - Identity card please. - Here you are. - Bed number 10. - First floor. - Righto. Bed for one night please, and bath. - Identity card please. - I'm afraid I lost it. You know the law. Have you reported it to the police? Yes, but I haven't got my new one yet. - Well, they must've given you something. - Never mind. Don't trouble. #Take us there on the road The road we love to roam # #And we'll never ever worry any more # # Where the pipers play and the kilties sway # #A- marching through the glen # #Take us where the heather blooms forevermore # #When we march, march along the road that leads to home # # Then we'll never ever worry any more # #There's a road that leads us homeward # # To the land where we were bred # #It's a road we're proud to say that only British feet can tread # # Let us march down the road our fathers marched before # #And we'll never ever worry any more # # When we march-## Well, maybe they haven't got the uniforms, but they have got the spirit. Look. There's Harry Gates, the poacher marching with Sir George. Ah, poachers is the men for the home guard, sir. They know this country- every inch. - Well, I must be getting along. - How's business these days, Sergeant? Not so good, sir. Not so good. They tell me there's a lot of them German spies come over with our chaps from Dunkirk... disguised as Tommies. We got word of a young fellow acting peculiar around Midhurst yesterday. But there, all they had against him was a wounded hand. Good-bye, sir. Don't forget the police concert Saturday. I'll be there. It's all right. I'm not a German spy. - You can search me for weapons if you like. - What are you doing here? Hiding. You look tired. I'm just going to have my tea. Would you care to join me? Thanks. Don't walk on the graves please. It's beautiful. Norman, isn't it? Really old. Yes, it's quite old. The western transept is Norman. The nave and the tower are thirteenth century. Excuse me. They say the villagers themselves built it in their evenings after work. They must have believed in those days- really and truly believed. - No one has that kind of faith today. - Are you sure? Perhaps you're only speaking for yourself. If you're not a spy, may I ask what you're hiding from? I'm a deserter. Thank you. This is the way to the rectory. - Do you like it strong? - Yes, please. You know, it's a funny thing, but I never thought I'd place such priceless value... on four walls, a fire and a cup of tea. Is that all you really need? No. I think most of all I need peace of mind. Would you be good enough? Over in that cupboard you'll find the cake jar. Over there. - There's some sherry there, if you'd prefer it. - No, thanks. You must forgive me if I'm rather conventional, but did you ever try to pray? Some people get quite a lot of help from it, you know. I've prayed all right. When you're in a jam, you pray- even chaps like me. At Dunkirk I prayed to God and the Pope and Buddha, Mohammed, to every one of them. I was too tired to pray later on, but while I could, I prayed to them all. No sense in taking any chances when it doesn't cost you any more, is there? - Sugar? - Oh, thank you. - Try one of these homemade cakes. - No, I don't think I could eat. That's because you're tired. Rest a while and try again. Where do you intend to go? Where do I intend to go? I wish I knew. Of course, I suppose I could stay here and cry "sanctuary. " Then you'd bar the door and no one could take me away. Isn't that the ancient right of your church? We've no physical sanctuary any longer, but we do help some people find a greater one- a spiritual sanctuary. Peace of mind, you called it just now. I'm sorry I was rude. That doesn't matter. I see you as a symbol of our age. An age of reason that's driven out the age of faith. How can you have faith in a thing when your reason tells you that you can't believe it? Reason deals with the things we know. There are a lot of things we don't know. Faith is useful when reason can't go any further. Faith is simply the quality of believing beyond reason. Isn't that perhaps what troubles you? You're not running away because you're a coward. All the reason in you calls out against... going back to fight in a war that seems warped and ill-defined. But the faith in you says you must fight, so that England shall not go down. There was a girl who said that... a beautiful girl who believed that. Your mind and your soul, deadlocked in a struggle- Your body, the battleground. Yes, it's simple, isn't it? You get so tired, so exhausted. The time comes when you just can't go on running anymore. I'm tired of being a hare to their hounds. I loathe being chased, and I hate myself for hiding every time I see a uniform. Maybe you're right. I mean, partly right. Perhaps I should give myself up... tell them what I've told you- Or as much as they'll listen to. It's their responsibility. Let them decide. I wouldn't make any hasty decisions if I were you. You may regret it. No. A man must have integrity. He's not entitled to free thought... unless he's ready to pay the price of admitting it. If I dare not admit what I believe, then I have no right to believe it. You may stay here tonight if you wish. I have a choir practice at 7:00, but- No. L- I'll go. And thank you. You've helped me a lot. At least I know what I'm going to do now. - Do you feel strong enough? - Yes. Whatever you do, don't think anymore. Trust your feelings, not your reason. If you do that, I believe your problem may soon be over. Thank you again. Good-bye. Left! Left Company, halt! Left! Left Company, halt! WAAF Gosley. Yes? What? Prudence Cathaway? Sorry, we can't bring anyone to the telephone for personal calls. But this is very important. I'm talking long-distance. I said we can't bring anyone to the phone for personal calls. Then will you write this down please? Mr. Clive Briggs wants Miss Cathaway to call him back at Merton 734. Yes, that's right. I'll be waiting right here. Thank you. - Finished? - Not quite. They're going to call me back. Do you mind if I wait here? Oh, no. That's all right. Oh, that's probably for me. Hello? Yes, I'm calling Gosley. What? Oh, one and six. Thank you. I owe you one and six. Oh, that's all right. Pay me when you leave. - Hello? - Is that Merton 7734? Prudence? Oh, Prudence. Is that you, Clive? What's happened? - Are you ill? - No, no, no, no. It's just- Darling, what're you doing? Where are you? Near London. Oh, Prue, I must see you. No, no. I didn't write before because- Well, because I couldn't. But now- No, no. No, it wasn't that. It's because I'm going to give myself up. Clive, don't do anything. Don't do anything until I see you. Promise? Of course. Prue, do you think you can come here? We'll get married. Can you get away? Get leave? Of course I can, darling. Only don't give yourself up. Don't do anything until I see you. I promise, darling. After all, if I gave myself up now, heaven knows when we'd see each other again. Oh, Prue, you're so beautiful. And I love you so very much. You do believe me, don't you? I believe you because- because you've never said you loved me before. Dearest, I didn't know, but I do now. It's suddenly so clear and- But you do want to marry me, don't you? You know I do, darling. - What time can you be here? - I can catch a train about 7:00. L- I'll be in London a little after 9:00. I'll be waiting at Charing Cross Station under the big clock. You better go now. You don't want to miss your train. No, no. There's plenty of time. Please talk to me. When a girl's been proposed to, she's got to talk to somebody about it. - And you're the only one. - Prue, I love you so. There aren't many girls who've been proposed to by telephone... and there're probably hundreds of people listening in. Until tonight- a little after 9:00. At Charing Cross, under the big clock. Bless you! Here's your one and sixpence. Is there an underground nearby? Down the street, round the corner, take you right to Leicester Square. - Thank you. - One moment, please. Can I see your identity card? Where did you go from Leaford? L- I'm not sure. I traveled at night. I don't know the places. Sergeant, will you believe me when I tell you that I was coming to give myself up? I swear it to you. But I wanted just one evening, this evening. Then you slipped off a lorry at the military barrier outside Midhurst? Yes. Can I see the officer in charge? It's terribly important. You'll see the officer in charge when the time comes. But I've got to see him now. Please let me see him. If only I could make you understand. I beg of you. - Parker- - Yes, sir. I'll be back in a minute. All right. Come with me. Here he is, sir. Yes? May I speak to you alone, sir? All right, Sergeant. They're calling from your home, sir. Hello. Oh, is that you, Thomas? Tell Lady Helen I'll pick her up at Claridge's at 9:00. No, no. Put out my full dress uniform. Tell Robert to have the car here in half an hour, will you? You wanted to speak to me, I believe. - If I may, sir? - Well? I hardly know how to begin. I want to ask you a favor, sir, and I know I've no right to ask it. I had an appointment to meet someone this evening. Believe me when I tell you that it means more to me than I can possibly explain. What're you here for? Desertion, sir. I see. According to your deposition, you'd already made up your mind to surrender. That's true, sir- Immediately after I'd kept my appointment. - You volunteered on the first day of war, I see. - Yes, sir. Arras, Dunkirk, twice mentioned in dispatches... recommended for Distinguished Conduct Medal- I don't quite understand. Why did you desert? I tried my best to fight for my country, but I- I found there were too many people in my way. I'm ready to accept whatever consequences there may be, but- Will you trust me, sir? I give you my word ofhonor that I shall be back here within two hours. Sergeant, I'm giving this man leave- leave until, uh, 12:00. Captain Marshall'll be on duty then. Will you tell him it's my personal responsibility? Very good, sir. Thank you, sir. My wife! My kid! They're in the cellar! Help! Help! - What is it? - He says his wife and kid are down here. - Whose? - I don't know. - The little chap that was here in the shirt sleeves. - Grab hold, chum. Perhaps we can lift it up. Pick it up. Here we go. Out with it. Stand by to lend a hand. Maybe I can make it. You're a little too big. I found her way in the back. Here. Take the kid Easy now. She's all right. The wall! Look out! The wall! Here, the walll Look outl The walll The walll Look out for the walll I can't get her out! You take her while I get up here. See what I can do. Right. Give her to me! Lift up her feet. All right. All right. I've got her. All clearl All clearl What train are you waiting for, miss? - Oh, I-I seem to have missed someone. - Hmm. Yes, I've missed him. - Miss Prudence! - Is my father in? Yes, he came from the hospital right after the air raid. Why, Prue! This is a surprise. Hello, Father. What is it? Something wrong? Oh, I-I just wanted to see you. You know, Prue, people come from all over the place to sit in that chair. Sometimes it's surgery. Most of the time there's nothing wrong- you just talk. What would be the use of me if I couldn't help my own daughter? It's funny. I always think of you as a kid in pigtails. - Father. - Yes? On my first leave, when I didn't come home, I went away with a soldier. We stayed on the coast. Oh, please, don't say anything, father. I know it was wrong, but we did nothing to be ashamed of. And then last night he telephoned me to come to London to marry him. But he wasn't at the station. I looked around, and I waited. And then I came here. That's all. Well, that's a simple story. He just changed his mind, I suppose. No. There must've been another reason. You see, he'd overstayed his leave... and he might've been arrested, or something may have happened to him in the raid. He'd been through terrible times at Dunkirk, and his mind was confused. He needs someone so much to help him. I've got to find him, Father. Can't you help me? I'll do my best. - Miss Collins? - Yes, Doctor? I want you to call military police headquarters and the casualty station. - Ask if there's someone there by the name of- - Briggs. Clive Briggs. Thanks, Miss Collins. Like some tea? Who is he? That is, if you care to tell me. He's just a soldier- a private. But the moment I met him I knew. Why is it like that, Father? We weren't in love then. - What makes it like that? - The wisest of us don't know that, Prue. It's so many things. It's how old you are and how the moon is... and what tune the orchestra played and left ringing in your head. Everything you ever done or thought in all your life... somehow makes a tributary stream that pours into that one moment. Excuse me, sir. St. John's Hospital on the telephone. Oh, thank you. Yes? Dr. Cathaway speaking. Oh, hello, Ferris. Yes, that's the name. Oh, I see. Yes, it is. I appreciate that. I'll come at once. Good-bye. He's been wounded in the head by debris. They're going to operate in half an hour. Ferris is a very good friend of mine. Do you want to come? It's not an easy case. A bad fracture on the left side. There may be danger of hemorrhage. We shall have to expect great intercranial pressure. Yes. I want you to meet my daughter. Prudence. - This is Dr. Mathias. - Good evening. - And Dr. Ferris. - How do you do? - We're ready, Doctor. - Thank you, Nurse. Excuse me. Nurse, will you look after my daughter, please? - I shall be glad to, Doctor. - We shall be some time, I think. Have some coffee. The nurse will take care of you. - Father. - Yes? Father, I-I don't know how to say it, but- please, please, do everything you can. Oh, thank you. How long does it usually take? Oh, it's difficult to say, Miss Cathaway. Sometimes half an hour, sometimes it goes on for hours. - Is he all right? - My dear, in cases of this kind there's no way of telling. - Could I see him now? - No. He mustn't be disturbed till the morning. Now, come home and get some sleep. - Father. - Yes? - Are you very tired? - No. Could we go somewhere? L- I couldn't possibly go home. Why, of course. I'll have some cold chicken, please, and a bottle of the SaintJulien. - Are you sure you won't have something? - Nothing, thank you. - A glass of wine, please. - Very well, madam. - Would you like to dance? - No, thank you. - I'm quite good. - Yes, I know you are. - Hello, Dr. Cathaway. - Oh, hello. Hello there. I bet people are saying "Look at that old codger with the beautiful girl. It must be his money that does it. " What's going to happen? Tomorrow morning-That's this morning now- He'll seem much better. That will be the relief of the pressure on the brain. He'll be quite rational and quite relieved. And then? In the afternoon we should expect certain signals- rising temperature, moments of irrationality. There's no more I can say as yet... no more anyone can say. Nurse, I'm thirsty. Now, just be patient. In a little while. I'm thirsty. The doctor'll be here in a few minutes. We'll see what he has to say. Prudence. Thirsty. - Prue. - Yes, Clive. How did we get here? - There was an air raid. - Yes, I know. But how long have I been lying here? Since last night. Last night? But, Prue, there was an officer of the military police. I promised him I'd come back. Don't worry. It's all been done. Everything is all right. Good. Give me your hand. My father, Clive. Well, young man... they certainly seem to have had a grudge against you. Thank you, Nurse. That's all right. Dr. Cathaway, has Prue told you that I want to marry her? I, Prudence, take thee, Clive, to my wedded husband. I, Prudence, take thee, Clive, to my wedded husband. To have and to hold from this day forward- To have and to hold from this day forward- For better, for worse, for richer, for poorer- For better, for worse, for richer, for poorer- In sickness and in health, to love and to cherish- In sickness and in health, to love and to cherish- Till death us do part. Till death us do part. With this ring, I thee wed... and with all my worldly goods I thee endow. With all my worldly goods I thee endow. In the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost. Amen. Amen. Thank you, Padre. Well, it's the best man's privilege to kiss the bride. Didn't have time to think up a decent present, nipper. I'll get you something permanent when I have a chance. Here. Be sure he don't set fire to himself. Well, so long, nipper. All the boys send their regards. And the captain says get better quick... because he'll be wanting you. Oh, here. Here's something he wanted me to give you. He always did say you were a highbrow. What is it, Prue? Shakespeare. Thanks, Monty. Tell the captain I appreciate it. So long. Drop in again tomorrow. - Aye. So long, Prue. - Good-bye, Monty. Mrs. Briggs must go now. Mrs. Briggs. "This above all, to thine own self be true. "And it must follow, as the night, the day... "thou canst not then be false to any man. Farewell, my blessing season this in thee. " "This above all, to thine own self be true. " - How is he? - I think he's a little better. Is that you, Prue? Yes, darling. You look much better. I am better. I feel clearheaded. - Better than I have for a long time. - Good. They don't leave us alone, do they? I'm not afraid. I feel safe when I'm with you. Remember, the nearer the bombs drop, the safer we'll be from then on. Thirsty? - You must go away now. - Away? Yes. You mustn't stay here. I won't have you here. Mrs. Briggs, I'm sorry, but it's best for you to come away. - We shall be watching. - I'd rather stay, if you don't mind. - Prue? - Yes, darling. Your cap, will you take it off? Of course. There. Is that better? Yes. Everything's all right. They're miles away. You'll tell me when they're close, won't you? Yes, I'll tell you. Honey top. Why don't you go and get some rest? No, I've stayed this long. L- I want to stay now. You can't help him by staying here. - It'd be just the same if you went down to the shelter. You can't let anyone die alone- even if they don't know. Why are you giving up so easily? I've told you there's still a chance, and I mean it, honestly. There's nothing we can do now but wait. Please let me stay. - I've brought you some tea. - Thank you. Try to eat a little. There's some food in the nurses's room. Those who can't be taken downstairs... we've orders to move them under the bed, to protect them from falling debris. No, no, please! Don't humiliate him like that. - Prue. - Yes? - They've gone? - Yes, they've gone. You won't leave me, will you? No, I won't. Do you feel better? Yes, I'm better. Do you know? I was thinking, Prue. It's going to be a different world when all this is over. You must rest now. Someday... we're going to fight for what I believe in. But first, we've-we've got to fight for what you believe in. You were right. We've got to win this war. - We've got to. - We will. "This above all- To thine own self be true. "
