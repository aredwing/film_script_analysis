I remember every dialogue from that film. Wow... bless you my 'Mureed'. - Who is 'Mureed.' My name is Neerja. Oho! Mureed means fan. Fan. Just like I am a fan of Dilip Kumar. And I am Rajesh Khanna's. May God bless you with a long life. Life should be big, not long. Well said! Goodbye. Hi! Yes. - Will you have some? Sister's here! Sister's here! - Go get ready. Hi Laado (Darling)! - Hi brother. Thank God you are here. It's a very boring party. Hi My 3D. - So sorry I'm late. Daddy's darling daughter! Hi daddy! Why are you so late? Everyone has been asking "Where is Neerja?" Why are you eating samosas? Are you hungry? Did you eat the fruit I packed for you? Yes. - I had packed flat bread for you. She must have eaten nothing! See! She didn't eat? Look at her. Look. Good evening everybody! Today, the boys and girls of Navjeevan society... ...are going to dance... ...to our favourite superstar Rajesh Khanna's song! Everyone's favorite superstar or YOUR favorite superstar! Mine too. - Mama not fair! My favorite! Everyone's favorite! Rajesh Khanna the super star's song! Look at your son! Sweet! "Bye-bye!" "Bye-bye!" "Bye-bye miss, goodnight. We'll meet again tomorrow." "Bye-bye miss, goodnight. We'll meet again tomorrow." "The day was colourful, the dazzling night has arrived." "The day was colourful, the dazzling night has arrived." "Bye-bye miss, goodnight. We'll meet again tomorrow." "Bye-bye miss, goodnight. We'll meet again tomorrow." Those were the kids! For Navjeevan society! That was amazing! And now a special performance by my parents! They are going to sing! They want you to sing, not me! You haven't clicked a single good snap of me! Click their snap! "My heart has been crazy since childhood." "Love is the reason for |ife." "The flowers didn't impress me, I never enjoyed a nap in a hammock." "The flowers didn't impress me, I never enjoyed a nap in a hammock." "I found solace in the softness of your tresses." "Bye-bye miss, goodnight." - Ok, dad. That's it! Enough flirting! And now... ...a special act! Our society's Robot-boy! "Bye-bye miss, goodnight. We'll meet again tomorrow." "PYE-bye!" - Bye-bye!" "PYE-bye!" - Bye-bye!" He is here. - He is here. Go down. Hello! - Hello! Quickly! Put it on the table. Good evening. Good evening. She loves posing for snaps! Don't bother. Everyone kept waiting for you to liven up the party. Hold it carefully. Careful. Did you see Mama dancing today? She was having great fun! - You mimic! I had to compete with you, right? She's perfected the dance step. Go to bed now. Please wake me up in a while. - Go get some sleep. Don't you get tired? Oh, Nikki! Why don't you take sick leave? Ican't... Shanti is also on sick leave... ...and this is my first flight as Head Purser. WOW! I'm not giving you this. I'll read it on the flight. Read it when you come back. You won't die if you don't read it. You're so mean. Papa, I never got back the last magazine I gave her. Look Laado, they're showing your commercial. Which one? You look like an aunty! These are 4 AK47s, 8 grenades and bullets. Safarini will wear the explosives belt. Fahad and Mansoor, be careful with the grenades. And these clothes are for you. Rama! It's 1 o'clock. If you let her sleep some more then she'll get late. I have to complete this article. You wake her up. Laado! It's 1 o'clock. - Let me sleep. Okay sleep, dear. You still have some time. Your modeling career is going so well... ...do you have to work so hard? Why don't you quit your job as an airhostess? I like my job. That's the problem. You know... ...when your plane takes off... ...so does my blood pressure. My blood pressure comes down only when your plane lands. You ate three samosas yesterday... ...that's why your blood pressure's high. Don't blame my plane. Oh my baby! BY the War... Huh? Did you tell Karim bhai to pick you for the airport? Jaideep's coming. Okay. I've switched on the water heater, dear. Come on. Come on. Pack the guns. We will work hard. We are prepared. We will do anything to succeed in our mission. We will definitely emerge victorious. One more... - Mom. Just a little more... - Ma, please. Only a little. Where's your ring? - Don't know. Can't find it. What do you mean you can't find it? Mom, I looked everywhere. I told you never to take that ring off. Did you look under the pillow? I promise I searched the entire room. It's not there. Check the bathroom. - Mom...I've checked everywhere. It's not here either. You keep flitting around like a busy bee. You get so many things done in a day... ...but you can't take care of a single ring. I got it specially made for your safety. My sweet mom. If this happened then that wouldn't happen. If that happened then this wouldn't. Eventually what has to happen will happen. Understood? WOW! What film is this dialogue from? My child! It's an original dialogue. Stop spoiling her. Wait, Laado. I've made rolls! Don't give all of it away. Keep some for yourself too. Okay. BYE, mom! Oh...my vanity case. Okay, bye- Laado...your birthday's on the 7th. You won't be here! I'll celebrate in Frankfurt! But don't forget to get my birthday present. Tell me what you want! You remember to yell at me but you forgot this? I want that yellow dress. - Yes, of course. I remember now. I'll definitely get that dress, dear. Bye! - Bye! Aunty, you take good care of uncle. I made a big mistake. Jaideep is the right boy for Laado. I wonder why I got her married to Naresh. Will Mansoor and Fahad be able to do their jobs? - Yes, they have been properly trained. They're both good. We will hijack the plane and meet in Cyprus. In exchange for the passengers... ...we will get our brothers out of jail. May God protect you. Good bye! - Good bye! May God protect you! See you in Cyprus! "Oh my dream girl, when will you come?" "The weather is so fine, when will you come?" I'm being really honest... ...when you're not here... ...I miss your voice the most. But you don't like my voice, do you? I listen to your voice with my heart, not my ears! Oh really! I really miss you. "Gent|y.. gY- - " You can also say, "Jaideep, I also miss you". "..the gentle breeze.." "I miss yoummademoiselle." "..my persona began to soar." "Oh fragrant. mesmerising |ove.." "Deep, immersive love." "I'|| wrap myself in these thoughts." "I'|| connect to those memories." "Oh fragrant. mesmerising |ove.." "Deep, immersive love." Now slow down... stop here! Hey I'm a good boy. I don't like where this is going. Please don't waste time, just look at that. What do you think? Who's that? Can't you see? That's you? No it's someone else. That can't be you. Very funny. The photographer must have worked some magic. I thought... since I am not here on my birthday... if you missed me... you could come here. But you look really nice with makeup. Thanks. Fine, let's go. Forget it. Take me to the airport. - Listen... I have to report at 2.30... - Listen! What? You look beautiful as a bride, mademoiselle. "Gent|y.. gY- - " "..the gentle breeze.." You look beautiful as a bride, mademoiselle. It's 2:27am... 3 more minutes to go. What do you need 3 minutes for? These 3 minutes are very important for me. Okay. Your idol Rajesh Khanna is going to do me a huge favor. In three minutes? Okay. What's this? - Your birthday present. I'm opening it. Not yet... - Why? Open it on your birthday. - No, I'll open it now. No! For my sake! And.. - Hi, Jaideep. Hello... - HI. Tina, unfortunately only we have to deal with grouchy company drivers. You're right.

The pilots are on their way, please be patient. Tell him! Pilot! Pilot! Pilot! At least give me enough time... ...to get information from Imran. Please hurry up. Five minutes. Five minutes. - Okay, brother. I'll let you know in a while. - Be patient. Why you not tell? Imran Ali? Huh! Why? Come here. Come. Hero, huh! Sing. Last song... sing. Sing for them. Sing. Sing loud!

Go, g0, 9- Laado! "Teach me to walk again, lift me in your arms, mom!" "Wipe my face with your shawl, wherever you spot some dirt." "When life stares down at me." "I remember your words.." "You're the one who scolded me for my mistakes!" "Why isn't the whole world like you, mom?" "I want to complain about everybody, they trouble me, mom." "Give me shelter, call me to you, my heart is with you." Laado! He needs to use the washroom urgently. Your p|ane...country... Hey! What are you saying? - Stand up! Hey! Go back. He needs to use the washroom. - Go back. He's just a kid, let him go. - Go back! He needs to go to the bathroom. - Go back. Let them go. I'll keep a watch. What do you mean let them go? - He's just a kid... - Is he your kid? Brother, he's just a small kid. That's the least we can do. Please control your anger. Control my anger? Are you trying to teach me? Yes. Yes? You are trying to teach me? Khalil! What are you doing? - What's going on here? What's going on here? Why? - Why? - He... If we fight with each other the passengers will overpower us! - Where's your head? I'm sorry, aunty. It's okay. It's okay. 5mm it! Shhh. Come, come, come. Move! Go! It's okay. Open! Little time? Little time! You need more time. - This is not a Pakistani airline. So the pilots are taking longer to get here. Tell him! How much longer? More time? 5 minutes. 10 minutes. 20... 30... You're letting them fool you. What are you doing here? What are you doing here? Go down now. - Are you hearing me? Khalil. Khalil! The devil is playing with us. Go down now. NOW! I know what to do.

You next? Sit down! Where's the radio engineer? Where? Oh...dead. He's dead! I want my mother. - Me too. I want my mother. - Me too. We'll all go home soon, okay. Eat something. Here. Mom, I am not hungry. I made this specially for you, you must eat one. I've a sore throat, so it hurts. What do you feel like eating? I don't want anything. Seriously, I don't want anything. It'll get wasted. How about we ask Sharma aunty... ...to teach us how to make chow mein. If you learn to cook a few things... ...you'|| have fewer problems when you go back. I feel if Laado can mould herself... ...then things will be better. I don't mean that she isn't trying... Who said she is going back? Instead of making her understand, you are encouraging her. Girls always have to be the ones to adjust. Can we discuss it some other time? Let's talk about this later. Will things get better by brushing this under the carpet? There are differences in every marriage. You can't give up on your marriage, dear. You don't know everything... - Then tell me. What happened? Let's first finish.. Laado! Laado! What's that? Naresh wrote letters to papa. "Dear sir, I don't like that... ...you keep calling up your daughter so often." "No respectable father will ever let his daughter model..." "If you call Neerja to Mumbai again..." "...then don't bother sending her back." "Even a poor man sends his daughter with gifts when she gets married." "You sent Neerja empty-handed." "Harish...your daughter doesn't know basic chores...even cleaning." "She is of no use to me" Mummy, I swear, I tried to do everything. I swept and mapped the floors... ...washed clothes, cleaned the utensils. When I came back home, the wound on my head... ...wasn't because I slipped and fell. I am sorry, papa. No, dear. I couldn't be your brave girl. I ran away. No, dear. No, dear. I don't want to die before I am actually dead, mom. I won't send my Laado anywhere. I'll be right back. What? I'll give everyone something to eat. Aren't you hungry? - Go! I need help to distribute refreshments. Let's just give food to everybody, okay. Neerja, do somethingmplease... Some more. - Hey... move back! Back! - Give! Please read this. On my signal, you have to open the emergency exit. Get water. Go! Move! Back! Back! Hello! Hello! Hello! Come on. Sir. - Yes. 379 people are trapped on that plane. Don't you think this can be quite humiliating for Pakistan? Why should it be humiliating for Pakistan? The terrorists are not from Pakistan. The passengers safety is our priority. We're doing the best we can. Sir... -Yeah. What are the demands of these people? We're trying to talk to them. As soon as we come to know, we'll let you know. Sir...if we can't fulfill their demands... ...then what will the government's stance be? Do you think that the Pakistani government is sitting idle? You two will cover this section. Yes sir! Water. "Neerja..." "I have been eagerly waiting for your birthday." "I've re-written this letter 15 times." "But I finally found the courage to give it to you today." "Neerja I know that you're afraid." "Your fear is completely justified." "Fear eventually gives us courage." "Your past will try to stop you from moving on in |ife." "But even with that fear, move one step forward for my sake." "Marry me, mademoiselle." "You are the one who believes that life should be big, not |ong." "Let's live a big and grand |ife." "Please say yes." "By the way which film is that dialogue from? Safar right?" Anand you idiot. Good evening. This is All India Radio. You're listening to the news with Vandana Mehta. In the headlines. Due to the hijacking of Pan Am flight 73 in Karachi... ...the situation continues to be tense. Even after 15 hours of negotiations... ...things are at an impasse. It's being said that these terrorists... ..be|ong to Pa|estine's Abu Nidal Group. There are more than 100 Indian passengers and flight crew on the plane. Three men are in airport security uniforms. - Yes. This guy is wearing a pathani suit. Look at him carefully. He is their leader. We have 4 entry points. These two in the front. The five of you will go in first... - Yes sir. ...from this entry point. Yes, sir! Please protect my daughter! Please protect my daughter! Please protect my daughter! Sir. The target has opened the 2A window shutter. What's the order, sir? Don't shoot until you see all four targets. Sir, the plane lights are off! The auxiliary power's run out. - Let's go. - Military has cut the power for the plane! They are going to enter the plane! The military won't enter! Only the light has gone off sir! The military won't come inside. - Sir... the battery is down sir! That will put the passengers in danger. The time has come! Everything will be over now! Fahad! Mansoor! Fahad! Kill them! It's time. It's just the emergency lights! Shut up! Sir the auxiliary power has run out. Sit down! Shut up! Come on, come on! Let's go out! Come on, get out! Come on, slide down! Out! Out! Sanjana, come quickly. Let's go. Come. Come on, move! Come on, move quickly! Slide down! Please open the door, sir. I'll help you. Come on. Let's g0! Out! Come out! Come out! Sir, come out! Mansoor! No, Fahad. If you throw the grenade we'll all die! We're already dead, Mansoor! We can survive Fahad! Let's go son. Leave her, come with us. We can still escape, Fahad! Neerja, come on. - You go, I'm just coming. Ma'am come! Leave us. Mama come. Come, come. Samar, carefully! - Jump, jump! Neerja, get down! Neerja, let's go! Sir, come on, sir. Mama! I want my mama! Neerja aunty, save us! We want our mama. Please save us! Please! Help me please! Come, come on. We have to go down this slide. Come on. Come with me. Jatin... get down. Go down. No, no, no...do you have any idea what we're going through. I want to know the status of purser Neerja Bhanot. No, I will not hold the line anymore. I'm tired of holding the line! Hello. Hello. Hello. Why are you crying, son? Why are you crying? Your sister will be fine. Be quiet. Come here. She will be fine. Why is he crying? This is bad, you shouldn't cry like this. Don't cry. It brings bad luck. Mr. Harish... ...but there's a lot of confusion here. It's difficult to get any information. Give me some time... I'll call you as soon as I find out anything. Can you hear me? Hello. Yes...thank you. - Bye. Rama. Let's go. Come on. Shall we go? Come, son. Let's go. Hello. Welcome home! Look... ...on your birthday. Mama remembers, darling. Neerja's mom. She sent a message for you. What? - Pushpa, I hate tears. Neerja is no more. It's been over a year... It's hard to believe. So cheerfu|...so full of life... ...so...happy-go-luckl- And she... ...passed away on her 23rd birthday. At first, it really hurt that... she sacrificed her life for her passengers. She didn't even think about her mama once? Everyone asks me... ...what kind of upbringing did you give your daughter... ...that she grew up to be as brave as a soldier... ...that the guns didn't scare her. I didn't even know that... ...my daughter was so brave... ...and such a good hearted child. In fact, I would keep nagging her. "Don't work so hard." "Lower your eyes while walking." "Mind your own business." "Think about your own honor and life, when in danger." Isn't that what we teach our daughters? We consider our brothers to be the brave ones. Sisters expect their brothers to protect them. No one ever asks a sister for protection. That's how I raised Neerja as well. That's how I raised Neerja as well. You could share a laugh with her... ...make her recite any of Rajesh Khanna's dialogues. But I wonder how this child... ...turned out to be so completely different. Her horoscope said... ...that she was destined to be a shining light. But when you lose your 23 year old daughter like this... ...that pain is impossible to describe. There can be no bigger pain in the world than losing one's child. At times, I felt like dying too. People tell me that Neerja isn't dead, she has become immortal. I console myself... ...that my Laado's become immortal. But what about the haunting thought... that I'll never see my daughter again. The night she was leaving for her last flight... ...I kept nagging her repeatedly. "Do this...don't forget this...do that..." And she left. I wish I had taken her in my arms just once... ...and hugged her tight. Just once. When Neerja received the highest honor for bravery, the Ashok Chakra... ...President Gyani Zail Singh consoled me. He said... ...that there is no other mother in the country like you. You should hold your head high with pride. You should be proud. "By sacrificing her life while trying to save the passengers..." "...Ms. Neerja, displayed exceptional bravery under unusual circumstances." Harish and I must have good karma... ...that Neerja was our daughter. Even as she was breathing her last... ...she taught me how to live. There was a small child on the plane, she told him... "Tell my mama..." Neerja's mom. She sent a message for you. That... "Pushpa..." "I hate tears!" "This fleeting moment coaxes you to think beyond yourselfu" "Go on |iving.. go on |iving.." "Forget the sorrow of strangers." "Let the sun shine through your window." "Go on |iving.. go on |iving.." "Beneath the feet is co|d.." "..the earth which beckons us to sprint." "A lively fragrance in the chest of time, it leaves everything behind." "Let the sands of the past slip through your fingers." "Allow yourself to be in the here and the now." "This fleeting moment coaxes you to think beyond yourselfu" "Go on |iving.. go on |iving.." "A slice of laughter for taste.." "A twig of life for keeps." "Go on |iving.. go on |iving.." "Overcome the hiccups and hesitations.." "This is the plea of time." "Why die when you can live?" "Drink the drops, it's the rain of your dreams." "Let the streams pave the paths." "Let yourself go beyond the light." "This fleeting moment coaxes you to think beyond yourselfu" "Go on |iving.. go on |iving.." "This fleeting moment coaxes you to think beyond yourselfu" "Go on |iving.. go on |iving.." "We'll look fear in the eyes." "We'll pass through the path of danger." "We've set out with passion.." "We'll look fear in the eyes." "We'll look fear in the eyes." "When it rains from people's eyes.." "..it marks the arrival of a new season." "My dreams taught me to live." "The night of life has passed.." "Bright and shiny is the morning!" "To hell with you, fear.." "Your time's up, fear.." "Let's get straight buddy, fear is nobody." "Open your eyes, no shut. Tell fear to get lost!" "Tell fear to get lost!" "We'll look fear in the eyes." "We'll pass through the path of danger." "We've set out with passion.." "We'll look fear in the eyes." "We'll look fear in the eyes." "We'll look fear in the eyes."
