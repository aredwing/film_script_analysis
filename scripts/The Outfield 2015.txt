Is that paint on your glove? Yeah, I guess I left the lid open. - So, then what happened? - Oh, yeah, yeah. So I texted him. He texted me. I texted him. He texted me. I texted him. He didn't text me back. So I texted him again. Then that little "I'm writing something" bubble popped up, those little... the three dots. Then that disappeared. What is that about? You think something's wrong with his phone? There's something wrong, all right, but it's not with his phone. It's like we're monkeys in a frickin' zoo. You're the one they're looking at. Seriously, dude, I don't know why you don't just sign with one of them and get it over with. What about you, man? Any calls? No. It'll happen. You know, I heard it helps if you actually attend class. Okay, good job! Let's go! Banana drills. Oh. Right in the jaw. Yeah, you think that's funny, huh? Outfield! His panties are in quite the bunch today, huh, guys? When aren't they? - That guy needs to get laid! - Dude. He's not wrong. - Good hit. - Don't sound so surprised. Of course. Maybe if they had real coffee here... - Hey, Ms. Rachels. - Oh. Hey, Jack. How's your mural coming along? Actually... and maybe you could help me with this... I was trying to digitize some of my animation drawings. Oh, yeah. Sorry, Jack. Digital animation is a little out of my league... no pun intended. Uh... Oh, before I forget, I, uh... I finished that book you gave me. - Oh. Did you like it? - I loved it. I thought it was amazing how Haring held on to his graffiti roots even after he became, like, an art superstar and how Basquiat and Kenny Scharf formed, like, a... like, a little artist community and they inspired each other. Well, you know what they say. It takes an artist to know an artist. Hey. Can I ask? Why would you leave a city like New York to come to a place like Peoria? I mean, not that it's bad or anything. I just needed a change. - You ever go to Yankee Stadium? - Oh, sure. Plenty of times. Not real fond of the new one, though. Me neither. It's like a ballpark on steroids... which I guess is kind of fitting. Hey, Jack? Has anyone ever told you that you have talent? Yeah. Wait. You mean with art? Yeah, with art. No, not really. - Well, you do. - Thank you. You know, I may be way out of line, but, uh, I have something I really want you to consider. California Institute of the Arts? Cal Arts. It's all art all the time... painting, drawing, sculpture, and arguably the best character-animation program in the country. It's basically a feeding ground for Pixar. Eric Darnell went there? And Tim Burton, John Lasseter, Brad Bird. Well, if you're interested, I can help you fill out an application. Look, Ms. Rachels, I really appreciate that you're thinking of me and everything, but I'm playing ball next year. Oh, I was under the impression that your college plans were still undecided. Technically, I haven't actually signed anything yet, but the ball part's pretty much a given. Well, in the meantime, consider your options, all of your options. There you are. I've been looking everywhere for you. Oh, hey, Em. Or should I say Coach Emily? Ha ha. Very funny. Hey, I heard the scouts were out today. How'd it go? You know, they don't really say much to us. Well, they better be paying attention when you're out on the field. I didn't defer your college for my health. I know. I know. Just think, you, me, State. No parents, no curfews, coed dorms. - Can't forget about those. - Me neither. Oh, shoot. Time to babysit the rejects at JV track. I love my life. Don't go too hard on 'em. Me? Never. Every second step is a stumble That gets you closer to the line You're a mystery kid And whatever you get, you borrow But it's hard to know You never believed I was set to see But I've got eyes in the back of my head And you never conceived I could read your book so well Let's go, Jack! You're a ghost in this life A collection of un-waved sails You're a ghost In the party line - You sure it's set on six? - Hey, you guys... Uh, what? Uh, yeah. Yeah, it is. Hey, you guys want to help me break in my dad's new Jet Ski this weekend? No way, dude. I got scouts in town. Yeah. Me either. Why not? I got stuff I got to do. Does "stuff" have anything to do with Sheila Cohen's parents being out of town this weekend? - A gentleman never tells. - What? Dude, that's... Her hotness is, like, epic level. Doesn't she have a brother? - Nope. - Hot ones never do. No, please. Don't get up. I got it. Good, man. You're doing great. "Franchising opportunity"... Ugh. This sucks. Jack's got suitors. You got stuff. Such balls, man. What am I supposed to do? Hey. Can you come load me again? Ackerman! Can you take care of that, please? I'm sure you'll find someone willing to apply sunblock to all your hard-to-reach places. They won't have your gentle touch. Gentle like this? Ooh. Hmm. Actually, no. A little bit more like this. All right. Hey. Welcome to Austin York's Batting Bonanza. I am Austin York. - Cage for two? - Yes, please. Oh, well, right this way, please. Watch your step over our little helper friend here. It's kind of a charity thing. We do a lot of that here at Austin York's Batting Bonanza. Right this way. So we have Jack Sanders here, all-star, hitting in this cage if Ackerman would just load the machine! Cage three, right? Yes. Uh, 40 bucks. There's no student discount? Let me guess, Oak Lawn? Uh, how'd you know? Platinum is the card of choice among Peoria's elite. Shoot. We left the bats in the cage. What's so funny? It's easy to do when you're used to people picking up after you. Excuse me? He dies, by the way, Gatsby. At the end of the book, Wilson mistakes him for Tom and shoots him. I know. I saw the movie too. Hey, there he is, the future of Tiger Baseball. - Coach Schoffman. - Hey. Take a load off, son. I didn't realize you were in town, sir. Yeah. I'm taking a look at a couple of... thank you... a couple of juniors over at East. Do you know Greg Sanford and Doug Millan? - Hey, Jackie. - Hey, Dad. Played against Sanford in the Final Four last year. So how are things going? Really good. Just, you know, working on my swing. Oh, well, you know, the hitting coach at State is one of the best in the game... that is, of course, if you sign with us. But no pressure. Well, I got a lot of homework I should probably go get started on. All right, all right. Well, it's always good to see you, kid. You too, sir. - Night, bud. - Night, Dad. Oh. Oh, I remember when your mom took this. How is she? Have you heard from her lately? She doesn't exactly keep us apprised of her movements. Of course, right. Sit down. Sit. Where are my cleats? Guys, Dad... where are my cleats? Joey, Tommy... I need... Get out of the way. I don't know where your cleats are. I need to find my cleats. - I don't know where they are! - I don't know, man! - Frankie. - Ah. Joey, you all set for Thursday? This iron has seen better days. Mom, it's okay. Mom. Mom. Okay. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. - What time's the game? - 12:30. All right. Why don't you boys stop by the diner afterwards and I'll fix you something to eat? Sounds good, Ma. Hey, Einstein. Hey, he's a ballplayer. Oh, excuse me. Mr. Mantle, don't forget. You got obligations after the game. What kind of obligations? He's a big boy now. Don't worry so much. I just have to drive them somewhere. It's nothing big. All right. Thanks. Found 'em. - Hey, Jack. Can we talk? - Uh, not now, Dad. Shh. All right, I'm hiding. Why's your door locked? Jack? Hey, Dad. What's up? Why are you so sweaty? Oh, you know, I was just, uh... cleaning. Cleaning, huh? Cleaning what, your teeth? You missed a spot. So Schoffman has some concerns, valid ones. He feels you need to bulk up considerably if you want to stay at center. None of the other schools seem to have a problem with it. I think we need to discuss moving you back to second. I haven't played second since little league. Second's a much better fit. It was a mistake to ever move you in the first place. But I made All-State. And what about Austin and Frankie? What about 'em? We're the Outfield. I need them. No. Come on, Jack. The only reason I ever moved you from second was because I thought being out there with those two chuckleheads might bring you a kind of... They're not chuckleheads. Being out there with those two chuckleheads might bring you a kind of, I don't know, a comfort after your mom left us. She didn't leave us. What's this? Cal Arts? I'm gonna kill Ms. Rachels. Who? Ms. Rachels, the new art teacher. You know her. She thinks I should, you know, apply to, uh, art school. They have schools for that? Come on, Dad. You know I draw. And I drive. You don't see me going to Daytona. Wait. Is this about your comics? They're not comics. Jack... art is not a life. I wish you'd take that thing down. It's the only thing I have left of hers. Sorry you had to hear that. Are you mad? I was recruited too. Remember? But I pushed it off for you because I thought it was our dream to start at State... together. It was. I mean, it still is. So can you explain why you have that brochure for art school? I didn't even ask for it. Ms. Rachels just gave it to me. Then why are you being so defensive? Wait, Em, please. Give me a reason to stay. There's just so much right now, honestly. First, my dad wants me to change my position, and then State says I need to bulk up, and everyone says I need to work on my swing, but all I can freakin' think about is, what if the scouts decide I can't cut it? I'm scared of letting down my dad, but most of all, Em... Em, I-I'm scared of letting down you. You never let me down, Jack. You just shut me out. I don't know. I guess when Ms. Rachels mentioned this school all the way out in California, it just... it made me feel like I had another option. But you don't really want to move to California, do you? Nah. I mean, that would be crazy. Psst! What are you doing here? What is your problem, bro? My problem is that it's your free period, and you should be coming to the Dairy Fair to get Freezies with me and Frankie. I know this new art teacher is hot, but... - Mr. York. - Ms. Rachels. This isn't the boys' locker room. No. I had the urinals removed last week. Touch, milady. - Touch. - Ow. Actually, Coach sent me. He needs our young Mr. Sanders for something. - What kind of something? - Something important. What kind of something important? Oh, something very important. - Oh, something very important? - Yeah. Hmm. Well, we don't want to keep something very important waiting, so... We don't. There you go. Hey, Jack, did you get a chance to look at that Cal Arts brochure I gave you? You know what? I totally forgot. Oh. Well, if you need help putting together your portfolio or anything for your application, just let me know. Yeah, I'll let you know. Don't you want to think this is our time? Don't you want to think this is our time? Maybe second base is a good idea. And break up the Outfield? Hell, no. Yo, so, why is Ms. Rachels riding you so hard about art school? Oh, it's, like, the best in the country or something. I don't know. She wants you to give up playing ball for that? While I'm out here working on my homework. Great. - Hey, you're back! - Yeah, we are. Um, I was wondering, do you guys have any batting lessons? Yeah. Of course we do. We just... Oh, actually... our batting coach just got drafted by the Cubbies, but I'll tell you what, my man Jack here, was just named All-State. - Really? - Yeah, um... I'll tell you what, how about I take you out for a lesson, huh? - You? - Yeah. Sound more grateful, all right? Come on. What you reading? Why? You want to ruin this one too? Forget it. You know, you were really rude the other day. No, I was just honest. Those aren't mutually exclusive concepts, you know. Hey, Fancy Pants. Swing through, and you're just gonna want to elbow up... Okay. Yeah. That's gonna be what not to do. So what you want to do is... Magnitude of electrostatic force of interaction between two point charges is directly proportional to the scale of multiplication of the magnitude of charges and inversely proportional to... To what? Tell me. And spoil the ending? That's your move, not mine. Jerk. Just tell me. I actually have no idea. So what are you doing tonight? You're looking at it. Homework? On a Friday night? Yes, homework on a Friday night. Is there something wrong with that? So many things, I don't even know where to begin. Hmm. Okay, super-awesome cool guy, what should I be doing on a Friday night? Going to a party... with me. Oh, really? Really. - Well, okay. - Yeah? Kels, you're never gonna believe what just happened. - What just happened? - Austin got hit by a ball. Oh. Um, is Austin okay? Nope. Dying slowly. Well, we should probably get going. - How much is it? - On the house. Oh. Thank you. See you later. You bet ya. - What? - You know what. What? What was all that "you bet ya" about? Yeah, dude. There is so much intrigue. Don't you have somewhere to be that requires you to tuck in your shirt? Knock 'em dead. Can you technically knock someone dead at an art show? Mr. Sanders? Oh, please. Call me Coach. Oh, I'd rather not. I'm Andrea Rachels, Jack's art teacher. The lady with the brochures. You must be so proud. Oh, it's a good hobby. Jack is very talented. The way he's able to draw inspiration from so many influences and distill it down into something so uniquely his own... it's incredibly rare. Oh, like I said, good hobby. And baseball is a great... game. Jack, I got to take off. Not too late tonight. Big game tomorrow. Big event tomorrow. - Good job, son. - Thanks. You know, Jack said his mother is a painter. There's nothing better than a budding artist learning from a parent. Where is she this evening? We're divorced. Oh. I'm sorry. Uh, he didn't say. Don't be. We haven't seen her in six years. I see. He didn't mention... She's not really worth mentioning, especially not to his art teacher. Oh oh oh oh Move right ahead into this door No matter what, we'll break... - Hey. You made it. - Ah, what's up man? - What's up? How are you? - How you doing? Hey - All right. Want a drink? No. I'm good. Have you seen Em? - Yeah. She's out back. - All right. In this life, we're learning All the bad, the good, and the refrains Love is life Ooh, love - What's up, man? - Hey, babe. Teaching Austin how to drive. - In your dreams, JV. - Uh-uh. Oh! Eat it, York. Shouldn't you be in college right now? Just get me something "schmeet," loser. Oh, "schmeet." You know, that's why you should be in college, loser. So, Em, there's something I've been wanting to tell you now for a while. Who is that? Her name's Kelsey, I think. Oh, my God. Are those pearls? - Be nice. - I'm nice... most of the time. Hey. - How'd it go tonight? - Pretty good, actually. I... Oh, sorry. Kelsey, Emily. Emily, Kelsey. - Nice to meet you. - You too. I love your necklace. Oh, thank you. Nothing says "I'm better than you" quite like a string of oyster vagina beads. - Hungry? - Famished. Come on. I have a feeling I am gonna like you way better than that last skank Frankie brought around. - She's your cousin. - By marriage. - Should I be worried? - I'd be. Look what we got here. So... That Emily sure has a lot of questions. Yeah. She's kind of a pain in the ass. No. I think she's just protective. Protective of what? Your little group. I think it's sweet how close you all are. And your friends aren't? Not like yours. Why not? You're not that wretched. Well, thank you. Very kind. When I was little, my... we used to move around every one or two years for my dad's job, and I wasn't super conducive to deep and meaningful friendships. I guess it kind of just became a habit, you know? It was easier to not let myself get too attached. Well, if that's the case, then... why are you here with me? I don't know. I guess sometimes easy gets boring. What you doing there, Picasso? - Nothing. Just... - Hey, but wait, dude. You never told me how that thing went tonight. Oh. Actually, I, uh... Oh, dude! Congratulations, man. - That's awesome. - Thank you. So is this art thing becoming, like, a "thing" thing or...? You know, I don't know anymore. You don't know? What do you mean you don't know? I just don't know. Jack. What? I don't know. It just doesn't matter. - Sorry. Did I wake you? - Nope. I was up, but I asked you not to stay out too late. - I was with Em. - Oh, really? Because she called an hour ago, looking for you. Jack? Where have you been? Just walking around, thinking. Thinking? Thinking about what? I don't know. Just... It doesn't matter, okay? I've got a lot on my mind. Well, that's just it. You just need one thing on your mind, your future. - That's all I'm thinking about. - Really? Because lately, it doesn't seem like you are. What the hell is that supposed... Hey! I'm still your father. You're late to practice. Your swing's getting worse, and now you're breaking curfew the night before a big game. - Curfew sucks. - What was that? I said who the hell cares about my stupid curfew? I do! I care about your future... because I care about you... even when you don't. Do you have any idea the sacrifices that have been made, that I've made to get you... You just want me to go to State because you weren't good enough! Where are my cleats? You want me to drop you off on my way to work? I can just ride my bike. Are you sure? It's on my way. Ah, it's okay. How the hell did they get up here? Oh, I'll take him. I need to have a little man-to-man anyway. I don't think that's a good idea. Ah, pipe down, you piping piper-er. I'm gonna just hit the can, and then we'll hit the road. All right, just go before your dad gets back. What about Dad? Let me worry about your father. - Bye. I love you. - All right. See you later. Surprise. Hey. What are you doing here? - Nice to see you too. - I'm sorry. It's just... I was about to leave. I know. I thought you might like a ride. Linda, car keys! Uh, I'm late. Do you mind if I drive? Kiss? Hey, Jack. Ms. Rachels. I didn't expect to see you here. Yeah, well, it's not exactly Yankee Stadium, but I thought I'd come and see what all the fuss is about, show some support, you know? Go, Owls. Hoot, hoot! - Well, have fun. - Hey, I got your email. And I would love to write you a letter of recommendation. Guys, bring it in! Welcome, folks, on this beautiful day, as your Peoria Owls take on the Diamondbacks. Welcome. Leading off for the Diamondbacks, Sawyer Malone. You know, State has a great fine arts department. - Really? - No, man. Of course they don't. Dude, stop staring at Ms. Rachels. - Get that ball! - Jack, heads up. Pay attention. Ooh. No college for you. Jack, it's all good. Let's do this! Batting now, Scott Kruger. - Austin, Austin! - Just to be clear... Move in a little! Get it in, man. Let's go! Ackerman! Ackerman! - Out! - Good! I see Kelsey showed up. Yeah, she showed up at my house to take me to the game too. How's her dad look? I don't know. Well, how's her mom look? Dude, stop. How's her dog look? What the hell, dude? Just leave it alone. Corgi? A sexy little corgi? Okay. Safe! Whoo! Batting for the Owls, Evan Willow. You really like this girl, don't you? She's okay. Sanders, Payton, get your head in the game. All right, boys, let's get it back! Hey. You know, if I were you, I'd be worried about her pops, man. All that blue around your collar, it might not be what he has in mind for his little princess. Hey, guys, you want to focus up? Sorry, Coach. Why should I care what her dad thinks? Dude, 'cause she cares. They all do. Go knock one out of the park. Now batting, left fielder, Frankie Payton. Strike! He's out! Let's go, Frankie. Strike three! You're out! I don't believe this. Come on! - You know what you should do? - Yeah. Sanders! Second base! Porro, take center. Second... now! What? This is bullshit. You'll be great, buddy. Okay, Jack. Strike three! You're out! - You were great. - Seriously? I had two errors, and I couldn't hit a thing. Yeah. I still... Plus, they pulled Jack from the Outfield. I still really enjoyed watching you play. Okay, enough stewing. Um, you're coming to dinner at my house tonight. I'ml can't. I have stuff I have to do. Can't you cancel it? My parents really want to meet you. Again, I have plans. What about tomorrow night? It would really mean a lot to me. Wow. It's a beautiful morning. Yeah, what's your dad gonna say when he finds out you closed up so early? Move me to second base just like yours. No, man, he's cool. Between the bowling alley, the dry cleaner's, car dealership, he just kind of trusts me with the cages. Whoa! And the crowd goes wild as York rounds the bases! As Sanders watches helplessly from his new home at second base. With the speed of a cheetah and the grace of a... Aah! More like a drunken fawn. - Hey, ladies. - Oh! Hey, man. Where you been? I had to help my brothers unload some scrap at the yard. What's he doing? Winning the World Series. - Of course you are. - Yep. I thought you'd be hanging with Kelsey tonight. You're, uh... you're hitting her up later, though, right? Not likely. You gonna tell us what's going on? There's nothing to tell. She wanted me to meet her parents. I don't want to. End of story. Why don't you want to meet her parents? Seriously? You're the one that told me I wasn't good enough for them. Look at me. What the hell would I wear? Oh, for the love of God. Frankie, come on. - Where are we going? - My house. Jack, pick my can up. Babe Dude, I think you just drew blood. Toughen up. - Babes - With four-inch heels Airbrushed nails, at the club Thanks, sweetheart. - Killer babe - Babes No, no. - Those are meant to be ironic. - No. "Jersey Shore" was incredibly underrated. I was much skinnier back then. I peaked in the seventh grade. Look her dad square in the eye and give him a firm handshake, and then at dinner, pull out her chair, you know, show her you're a gentleman. Oh, and bring the mom flowers. Moms love flowers. Just not roses. That says "brown-noser." Try it with the... Mm, no, never mind. - Yeah, no. - No. Absolutely, positively no PDA. Your tongue should never leave your mouth, and under no circumstances, no circumstances, should it ever enter hers. Just pretend you're on a date with Emily. That should help. Okay, I'll be quieter. Girls, girls, girls Hipster douche. You look like Kurt Cobain after clown college. Ask her dad about his work. Yeah, and talk about the weather. Rich people love to talk about the weather. Just be yourself. Not too much of yourself. Like a PG version of yourself. PG13, especially if they're drinking wine. Yeah, I think you're ready. Go get 'em, Tiger. - Girls, girls, girls - Women, women Are babes Killer, killer - Babes You can do this. Can I help you? Um... yes. Good evening, sir. Hello. Is Kelsey home? Yes, she is. - May I speak with her, please? - Kelsey! You have a visitor, a male visitor. Hi. What are you doing here? What's everyone doing out here on the porch? Frankie, my man! What's up, Henry? Ah, same shit different, different day. Henry... go help set a place at the table for Mr. Frank, is it? Oh. Yes, sir. Sorry. Frankie or Franklin Jr, wha... whatever you prefer, whatever you want. We'll set a place at the table for Frankie. I'll let your mother know we'll be one more for dinner. Please. I'm so hungry. I thought you were gonna text me when you got home. I'm sorry. I guess I just got distracted. By what? - Just kittens being cute. - Oh, my gosh. I watched a baby panda sneeze for, like, an hour yesterday. Let me show you. - Hey, Jack? - Yeah. What do you mean by "art is in my bones"? Em, please don't be... Mad? Why would I be mad? It's not like you made me feel like I was crazy for thinking something was up or like I didn't defer an entire year of college because you asked me to wait for you. Hold up. It was your choice to defer. When you love someone, Jack, they don't need to ask. You just know what they need, and you just do it. That's not what I meant, and you know it. This has nothing to do with you. Have you just been lying to me this whole time? What? Wait. Does this have something to do with your mom? - Huh? - Em... Do you have some fantasy that she's gonna hear about this and magically come back? I don't know. News flash, Jack, the woman abandoned you. Stop! Emily, just stop! This isn't about her or you. This is about my entire life being planned out for me by other people. I never said I was going to Cal Arts, but for the first time in my life, I feel like I can actually make a decision. If I go to State, all I'm gonna do is play baseball. What is so bad about that? I think I want more than that. Maybe we just want different things. Yeah, maybe we do. Henry, elbows. Wasn't it sweet of Frankie to bring us flowers, Mom? Yes. They're very fresh. Aka, stolen. Ow. How's your, uh... how's your filet, dear? It's delicious, Mrs. Meola. It kind of tastes like steak. If steak tastes like ball sack. You're excused, Henry. Yeah, I thought that would do it. Stay strong, brother. - So this weather we're having... - What about it? - Mm-hmm. - It's cold. It is unseasonably chilly. - So, Frankie... - Yes, sir? What are your plans for next year? You mean, like, college? Yes, like college. Um... I'm... I mean, I don't have anything definitely set up yet, but I'm... He's just weighing his options. I see. And is the scale tipping in any particular direction? Yeah. My coach is talking to a few Division III schools. Yeah, you know, Frankie's a great ballplayer. He's a part of the Outfield. Oh, yes. Jack Sanders. I read about you boys. That's fabulous. Well, what schools are you looking at? Uh, Augustana, Blackburn, Tech... and, um, I think Wesleyan. Oh, Daddy went there. Charles, you should give Theo Rasmussen a call. Theo was his college roommate. He's also the athletic director there. Oh, no, ma'am. You don't... you don't have to do that. Don't be silly. He wouldn't mind, would you, Charles? Happy to. Hello? Speaking. Why are you calling me? You sure it's her? Yeah, yeah. Okay. Thank you. I just don't understand why she did this. Jack, your mom was really nice to me when other people weren't, so... Her paintings were beautiful. Yeah. She really had that spirit, like she didn't give a damn what other people thought. It's admirable. Jack, bro, where are you going? What are you even talking about? This doesn't change a thing. Just 'cause she died doesn't mean she's a good mom. It just means she's a dead mom. Any word on our boy, Coach? And now taking the field, your Peoria Owls. Starting in left field, Frankie Payton. In right field, Austin York. And starting in center field, Jeremy Porro. Porro, take second! Sanders, center field! Play ball! Yeah! Go, Jack! That's my boy, Jack! Go, go, go, go, go! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Thank you again for coming out tonight in support of your Peoria Owls. Wow. Oh, shit. - What? - Oh. Who is that guy? Kelsey's dad. Oh, my other friends are calling me. The circle around the small circle... Mr. Meola. I didn't know you were a fan of watching baseball. Frankie, this is my good friend Theo Rasmussen. He's the athletic director over at Wesleyan. Frankie. Played with smarts and precision out there. - Thank you. - I'm impressed. Made any plans for next year? No, sir. All right. Well, I'll keep my eye on you. Cool. - Did you know I'm from Peoria? - No, sir. Born and raised over on 49th and Lincoln. Oh, I'm at 48th and Jackson. I got out, and I came back. To a much nicer part of town. Frankie... Kelsey is a very special young lady. She's smart, she's focused, and wildly curious about everything. And lately, the only thing she's been curious about is you. Mr. Meola, if this is the part where you tell me to stop seeing your daughter, then... No, Frankie. Do you know how schools like Wesleyan work? And that NCAA doesn't permit. Division III schools to offer athletic scholarships? No. Athletic directors tend to work around issues like these by helping their athletes attain alternative means of financial assistance, like student loans, federal grants, personal grants, alumni assistant grants. - Alumni like you? - Not like me. Me. So you're saying you'd do that for me and Kelsey? Yes. I would do that for you. You see, Kelsey has been very distracted ever since she met you, and as her father, it is my job to eliminate distractions. So here's the deal. I will talk to Rasmussen, Your phone will ring. It will ring with a scholarship. And it will be my money that makes it happen, that is, as long as you break up with my daughter. I'm giving you a shot out of the neighborhood. Let me know what you decide. Did you catch any of the game yesterday? Castro went 4 for 5, home run and a triple. They beat the Giants 14-2. They're calling it the "Sunday Slaughter." Hey, maybe this'll be the Cubs' year. Knock wood. - Hey, Dad. - Hmm? You think if the Cubs make it to the Series that we could go? You bet your ass we can. We'll be dancing from one end of Clark Street to the other. Oh. Thanks. I guess every day can't be a winner. Hey, I never heard back from you about that letter of recommendation. Did you turn your application in? - Not yet. - Well, the deadline is midnight tonight. Yeah, I know. Jack? Everything okay over there? Yeah. Why wouldn't it be? I want to tell you a story The only way that I can So I just heard you had a visitor at the game the other night. So what? Are you going to Wesleyan? What exactly did your father tell you about "our meeting"? Frankie, what's going on? Maybe I don't want to be your little project. On the dark side of the moon On the dark side of the moon I want to love you, I want to pass it on I want to give and give till it's all gone Ms. Rachels. Coach. You clean up nicely. Oh, thank you. I got Jack an extension on his application for Cal Arts. That won't be necessary. He's already made his choice. I want to know you while we have the time 'Cause that's all we got to leave behind On the dark side... Well, this is a very exciting day for us at State Baseball. I'd like to introduce you to the future of our team, Jack Sanders. And when you stumble, You look the other way And when you're riding high Oh, Lord, when you're riding high They don't expect you to stay I want to love you, I want to pass it on I want to give and give till it's all gone I want to know you Ms. Rachels, I love my son. I push him because I know he can be great. He is great. He can also be happy. I want to love you, I want to pass it on I want to give and give till it's all gone I want to know you while we have the time 'Cause that's all we got to leave behind On the dark side of the moon - Hey, Dad. - Hey. Is it cool if I go meet the guys? Of course. Everything okay? Yeah. Why wouldn't it be? - Boys! - Hey. - What's up, man? - Look what I got. What you got there? Ooh. Get that. Go, buddy. - Cheers. - To State! Yep, to State. Whoa, sparkling apple juice? Really, man? - It's all I could find. - Oh. I miss Fanta. Shut up, Austin. This is where it all began, huh? Yep. Let's do this. Ooh. Hey, Picasso, just so you know, you're shagging all those. Hey, slugger, might there be something you wish to discuss, lighten the load, if you will, before we... lose all of our balls? What are you babbling about? I mean, call me crazy, but it seems like you have something on your mind. I told you he's smart. I'm just having an off night. Oh, he's having an off night. Off night? Jack, dude, you're going to State. State. Big Al from Big Al's Swedish Pancake House just gave you free breakfast for life. - For life. - And I have no doubt that Emily will be bestowing what I can only imagine to be a very generous signing bonus later. Very generous. Just leave it alone, okay? - Just leave it alone. - Just leave it alone. I'm just gonna leave it alone. That's what I'm gonna do. I'm just gonna leave it alone. I have to pay for breakfast every morning... - Every morning. - For the rest of my life. Yeah. No, I understand. It sucks. Mm-hmm. Yeah. No, no, I understand. Yeah, Theo. I told him you'd be calling him. Look, maybe I mentioned that I'd take care of the scholarship if he broke up with Kelsey, but look, that was a while ago. I guess he's just not interested. Come on, he's not that good. Who, Kelsey? Of course not. She's fine. Moved on. Hey, in a few years, you'll get Henry. Just kidding. I won't do that to you. Hi. How you doing, honey? I'm fine. Really? Yeah, Mom. Why are you acting so weird? Oh, um... you know... you know, maybe it's time you forgive him. Oh, I already forgave Henry for drawing in my French book. I'm not talking about Henry. I'm talking about Frankie. Frankie? Why would I do that? You know how much your father loves you, and sometimes we do things for our children that may not make... make much sense. - Is the house on fire? - You need to get dressed. It's past noon. We have brunch with an alum. We leave in ten minutes. Hello? May I ask who's calling? This is Theo Rasmussen from Wesleyan. Oh. It's a Theo Ras... Ras... oh, something from Wesleyan. I'm sorry. He's not available. Yeah. Yeah, I'll tell him. Thank you. He wants you to call him. Why is Wesleyan calling you? Just a misunderstanding. You want to go to college? No. If you want to go to college, you just work with me and your brothers till you can pay your own way. Why Wesleyan? If they're calling, you must have something special they want. Kelsey's dad is tight with the athletic director, and he came to our game. Now he's offering to pay for me to go to school. The athletic director? No, Kelsey's dad. Why would he do that, honey? Because he wants me to stop seeing his daughter. What are you gonna do? If you had any balls, you'd dump her and take the cash. There'll always be another girl. Unless she's as special as your mom here. Maybe he's right. Wake up, Sleeping Beauty. We're here. Where's here? Put that away. You always say the alumni like it when I wear the colors. Just lose it. - Mr. Sanders. - Mrs. Covington, hi. This must be Jack. Ma'am. Make yourselves comfortable and help yourself to some lemonade. Thank you. She's not from State, is she? No, she's not. Please excuse this mess. Moving is an absolute nightmare. Are you familiar with Ed Paschke's work? No, ma'am. He and my husband went to the Art Institute back in the '60s. Was your husband a painter? He was. He also taught. I grew up over in Peoria Heights, but when my husband was gone, it just... it just felt right to come back home. Now, let's take another look. - Dad, what is this? - Just a moment, please. I know what he did, my dad. You do? And I also know you never called Rasmussen back. Why didn't you tell me? You would've hated him, or you would've hated me. Trust me, you don't want to hate your dad. For a while there, I hated you both. What about now? So, Jack... tell me why you need to paint. I don't. But there is need in here. There is passion in here. You're an athlete as well. Yes, ma'am. I'm playing ball next year. Don't you see? That's perfect. These are two sides of the same coin. We must never stifle our passion, never. Tell me something, Jack, how does art make you feel? Alive. I feel alive. There it is. Jack, I am prepared to make a case for you with the Dean of Cal Arts. But first, you must give me your word that you'll accept. How do you know Ms. Covington? I don't. She knew your mom. Hey. I was just thinking about you. I missed you today. Jack? Come here. Lie down. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. What's up, guys? Hey. Don't leave me hanging. Anyways, once I finally called Rasmussen back... We really hit it off. Turns out I'm not the only one that thinks Kelsey's dad's a big tool. - So you're going to Wesleyan? - Yeah. - That's amazing, bro. - That's huge, man. Congratulations. What about you, man? Going out of state? Hell, no, dude. I'm living the dream right here in Peoria, Ill. Really? Yeah. Guys, are you kidding? I live in a town that I love, a place where everybody knows my name, and I know everybody's name. I'm running my family's business, and, fingers crossed, if I don't burn this place down, it'll be mine someday. It may not ring your bell, but... it sounds pretty damn good to me. In all my years of coaching, I have never been prouder than I am of this team. You know, I first took this job because I just wanted to stay in the game. A walk-off home run, a ten-game winning streak, a no-hitter. But you guys reminded me that's not what's important. Austin York. What's important is the team you build, the family you create, the friendships you form. There are gonna be lots of wins and losses in life. It's who you share those wins and losses with. That's what's really important. In left field, the next starting outfielder for Wesleyan College, Frankie Payton! You guys are incredible. Trust me, teams like this are rare. It took me becoming a dad to find mine again. So what about you, Jack? Who are you gonna be, your mom or your dad? Well, I'm a ballplayer, and I'm always gonna play ball. And in center field, All-County, All-State, and soon to be freshman at... California Institute of the Arts, the pride of Peoria, Jack Sanders! So, when you find yours, and you will find it, you will, I want you to grab it. Don't be afraid. Grab it. Grab those people and grab those moments, because if you do, whether you win or lose, you will succeed. Okay, guys! Look alive! Look alive! Last game of the season! Hey, Sanders! Hustle up!
