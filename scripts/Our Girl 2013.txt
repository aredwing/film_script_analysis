Well be looking at the war against extremism waged by British and American troops over the border of Afghanistan... This programme contains strong language. This film contains some scenes which some viewers may find upsetting. This film contains some scenes of a sexual nature. A new study says more and more white British people are... ...lives lost and the fact that Barack Obama is about to pour thousands more troops into this region. It is by no means certain we will prevail. What we do know, from bitter experience, is that, whatever happens here, good or bad, the rest of the world will feel the consequences. Happy birthday, Molly! My little girls all grown up! Still very immature though, Mum. Don't forget that! Fluffy scrambled eggs, coming up! What times he getting here? Don't know.

Oh, yeah, as if! And dont let him tap you up for any either, Proud Mary. Why is he so crap, Mum? Why aint you wearing your bracelet? Erm... I didnt want to lose it. Its bound to get messy, isnt it?

I want you to be my girlfriend. So what was the dippy-blurt in the van all about, then?! I told you! She didnt look Albanian! What do we look like? You got funny-shaped heads and spazzer jeans. She arrive today. Doesnt speak a word of English. I am only person she knows. I trying to help her get away from very bad people. She my cousin. You... my girlfriend. You Albanian freak!

Gone to shit, mate. Our beautiful East London. Been ethnically cleansed. So us whites, we've been driven out, but no-one cares about us! No, no. Were not worth caring about. Were the wrong colour, thats our trouble! Whats the matter with you? What? Don't I get a civil hello? Don't wake the kids up. Ive had enough of you! Well, what did you come home for, then?! Cos its my house! Mine! Actually, its The London Borough of Newham's, but there you go! Thanks. Cheers. Is that you, Mar? Yeah? Oh, oh, hi, Moll. You all right? Having a good night? Yeah, wicked. Pass us a fag, Mar. Oh, ta! I'll see you at the table. There you are! Just been looking for you. Im just going for that fag. Hey! Hey, darling! Whats going on, babe? Looking good. Do you want to come to a party with us? Yeah, I'll come to a party. Right, jump in the back. Oi! Oi! Don't you want to fuck me? Oh, for fuck's sake. Shh. Go to sleep. Its Saturday. Where you going? Brush my teeth. I honk. Love you. Im glad someone does. Love you. Oh... Smells nice. I hope youre changing them sheets. What d'you get up to? Anything nice? Club. Might take you clubbing. What? Nothing. See Artan last night? Perry, right, proper chippy. He cant get any work cos the Poles'll build you a frigging house for the price of a cup of tea. Ain't worth his while getting out of bed. Artan's Albanian. You know what Im taking about. Im talking about the destruction of England. What did he get you? That aint an engagement ring? Don't worry, you two have put me off marriage for life. Yeah, dont let your gob run away or I'll shut it for you! Yeah, try it and I'll stab you. Molly! Youll do what youre told or you live on the streets! You think youre someone special, dont you? Well, youre not. Youre just a run-of-the-mill slag. I done this? Yeah, its shit, isnt it? I could turn it into daisies or something? I dont care, just get rid of the Artan. Definitely be better with daisies than just blocking it out. Whatever. Does it hurt? What you looking at? Dunno, lost me zoo book. Ha, bloody ha. You local? Yeah. Last white woman on Kath-rhine Road. Fancy an job in the Army, then? Great job that - 100 a week to have my head used as target practice. Got any leaflets then? Im only tentative. Im just checking out the options. Why dont you take a seat and we can have a chat? Don't be nervous. We dont just throw you onto the back of a truck. We only want soldiers who want to be soldiers. I didnt think youd want the likes of me joining up. Take these home and have a butchers at your leisure. How old are you? 18. What d'you have to do, then? Well, first, you have to do the BARB test. Just a short test you can do on the computer. Someone of your intelligence, itll be a piece of cake. Me?! Im stupid. I dont think so. Well, you dont know me. Im famous for being stupid. Well, we can do the BARB test now, if you like. Find out just how stupid you are. What and I just do it on the computer? Exactly. Touch screen. Then we throw you on a lorry and youll be in Helmand by tea time. Ill probably fail the test anyway. So... Do you want to do it now? All right. Lets do it! Oh! What you looking at? Dunno, lost me zoo book. Get a job. Im sick! Yeah, in the head. Mum, Im going down Sara Banajee's for a couple of days. Who? She got into college in Brighton, remember? They said at primary school that you were University material. Did they? Mind you, you were the only one who could speak bleeding English. Is Artan going with you? No, he aint. Can you try and be nice to Dad? Why? Because he wasnt always a dickhead. Right, left! Right, left! Turn! Ladies and gentlemen, if I can have your attention for a moment, please. OK. All right, these next two days are very important if you want to progress in the British Army. So take every task seriously and try your best, all right? For some of you, this is going to be the end of the line. For others, youll be invited to go on to the next stage, which is Phase One, Basic Training. OK. You know youre all here to have your medicals, but before you go in and see the doctor for your examination, youll have a few different tests first. Oh! Problem with that, 17? No, its just a bit boring so far. So that was your sit-ups. The Technical Selection Test is basically a mathematics test. Youve then got your undergrasp heave test. 55 questions. Powerbag lift and rope climb. Should take you about half an hour. Every applicant must take these upper-body strength tests. On you go. Oi! Did you fucking "oi" me?! My hand slipped, thats all. God, Im knackered. You? My hands still hurt from them jerry cans! You were good. I have to bring our shopping home from Iceland. Are you from London? Could you tell? How about you? Do you know Preston? Lancashire. So Preston's your town, yeah? Well, no, Leyland. But I didnt think youd have heard of that, but its just outside of Preston. Which I also hadnt heard of. Yeah, but you know where Lancashire is though, right? Yeah, obviously. Morning, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to this part of your selection known as The Icebreaker. Each and every one of you will be coming up here, individually, and telling us a little bit about yourselves. Whos going to be brave enough to go first? Uh? OK. I hear youve got a lot to say for yourself. Who told you that? Get up here. You never stop fucking chuntering on. Now, come on, now's your chance, cos we all want to listen. Good. Up here. Where you going? I dont want to stand up and talk. Fair play. The army's not for everyone. Leave now, though, and youll regret it for the rest of your life. You reckon? I know. See, I had you down as a trier, eh. I thought youd be brave enough to come up here and talk for a while. You dont think Im going to make the grade anyhow! I can see you all looking down your big, shiny schnozes at me. Don't be so fucking wet. Turn around and talk to the class or have everyone know what a lettuce you are. A lettuce? Loser. Couldnt do it when it matters, eh? You want that on your headstone? Lets see if youve got what it takes. My names Molly Dawes. I come from near Stratford, not the one that Shakespeare comes from, the other one in the London Borough of Newham, which sometimes I think is the nicest place on the planet to live and other times I think is a right shit-hole. Don't look at me again. Get on. Sometimes, I walk down East Ham High Street in the sun and smell the spices, and see every manner of people and I well up. I feel really proud of where I come from. And, other times, when its all powder keggy and like its about to blow, I just want to run. Just want to run away and live in a barn somewhere. I live off the Portway with my three sisters, my two brothers, my pregnant mum and my tosspot of a dad. All crammed into this little Lego house thats bursting at the seams with noise and toys and cheap Polish lager, kids scooters, piles and piles of washing that my mum keeps meaning to do, but shes always too knackered cos my dads enough to knacker any bugger out. Hes at home all day on the sick, cos when he was a Sky dish fitter, some toerag had it away with his ladder and he fell off this roof and landed in a bush. Done his back in. He went to hospital. He had to shit in a pan for weeks cos he couldnt get out of bed. Lost his job and... ...then, he got the depression, my mum reckons. Some days, hes as right as a ninepence, and other days, I see him hobbling around, moaning and groaning, like a 90-year-old. Then, a mate lends him a tenner and its a bleeding miracle, he can shuffle down the pub and get a pint down his Gregory, which, of course, he says is a muscle relaxant and if it wasnt for his back, then he wouldnt bother with the drinking. But sometimes, I can see it all mapped out in front of me. My shitty little life just waiting to happen. Middle-aged me, picking up toys and cans of lager, as my tosspot boyfriend pisses on any dreams I might have had. The one-and-a-half-mile run is an important test. Pass and youll remain on selection, fail and you may as well go home. Once youve completed your run, go back to your quarters and get ready for your interview. You will then be told whether youll be recommended for enlistment. Right, then, good luck, everybody. On your marks, go! You all right, Katy? Katy? My ankle! What are you doing? Shes fell over! I can see that. Leave her and move on! Come on Katy, get up! I cant! I said leave her! What the fuck is this? Two Little Boys?! Leave her. That is an order! How is it? Oh, its all right. Bit better. I did a timed run before the selection, so the Corporal reckons they might be able to take that into consideration. Well, Im screwed, then. You should have just left me. Anyway, I think I might have made a bit of a ricket on the clothes front. Here, have you got any other shoes? Only me trainers. What size are you? Five and a half. I got a pair of sixes. There you go. And what about leggings? Have you got any of them? Cos your skirt might be a bit short. I aint got any leggings. Here. Take them. Go in there and fight for your life. Ive got all the comments of the various NCOs and, in fact, everybody whos been involved in this two-day selection process. Yes, sir. Maam. We have to make sure any potential recruit has a 90% chance of making it through Phase One Training. Yes, Maam. You want to join the Royal Army Medical Corps, I see? You didnt make you cap badge time for your one-and-a-half-mile run. I need more training. I understand you stopped to assist another recruit who had fallen. You have divided opinion, Miss Dawes. You tell me why I should recommend you. Tell me why the British Army should have you swelling their ranks, and I dont want to hear, I want this more than anything. Truth? I reckon if I really, really tried my hardest, then, I wouldnt be the worst. And do we want someone who aspires to be not the worst? We need soldiers who aspire to be the best. Just give me a chance. And why should I do that? Because Ive never had one. And if Im given a chance, I wont let anyone down, I swear, Miss. A couple of the comments are extremely heartening. You clearly have attributes that youre either unaware of or too modest to promote. Thanks. Im not sure its a compliment, Miss Dawes. So... ...do I really think youre worth it? To be honest, I just wanted to talk to you, like, outside the house. Away from the noise. Well, if it helps you out, we know. Yeah, and we dont mind. Really? Well, youre our daughter, Moll. We love you. Youre not a little girl any more, so fair play to you. And its your decision. I thought you wouldnt approve. Well, I think hes a bit of a tool, but its your choice. Well, to be fair, we hardly know him, Dave. Who are you talking about? Artan. Whats it gotta do with him? Well, he is the father, isnt he? Oh, its not that mongy nut bar from Islington, is it? I aint pregnant! Did you think I was pregnant? No! Well... what was you going to say, then? When?! Bloody taking us for this nosh and everything. Im joining the Army. Youre fucking joking? Im Muslim, Molly! Whats that got to do with anything? What do you think!? Thats what your Army s for - to kill Muslims. Oh, thats pathetic. What about us, uh!? How long is this training? Its 14 weeks, Artan. Instead of you moaning and my mum and dad worrying about whos going to pick the kids up from school! You only care about yourself! Youre a selfish, stupid, fucking little girl! You join the Army... And what? What?! What you going to do? You going to kill me? I want to marry you! Even though I kill Muslims? I love you. You sure about that? Cos your old chap seemed quite keen on Proud Mary last time I looked! I, Molly Dawes, swear by Almighty God that I will be faithful and bear true allegiance to Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II, her heirs and successors and that I will, as in duty bound, honestly and faithfully defend Her Majesty, her heirs and successors, in person, crown and dignity against all enemies and will observe and obey all orders of Her Majesty, her heirs and successors and of the generals and officers set over me. Right. Thats one Queens shilling we owe you. Half a day's pay now. Thats inflation for you. Sir. Don't think being a combat medical technician is some easy option, Miss Dawes. Don't think youre going to be floating around the corridors of some well-equipped field hospital like Florence Nightingale. Youll be in some godforsaken shit-hole trying to tie a tourniquet on some poor bastard whos just had both of his legs blown off. Sir, yes, sir. Yes. A simple yes, sir will suffice. Were not American... yet. Ah, good, might get my leggings back! Feels a bit more serious this time, doesnt it? Two Section, line! Now! My name is Corporal Geddings. For the next 14 weeks, I am your mother, father, boyfriend, grandma and your bloody God all rolled into one. You are mine. More importantly, I am yours. I will do my best to make sure each and every one of you make the grade. I say something funny, Dawes? No, sir. Don't call me sir. I work for a bloody living. So whats funny? Nothing, Corporal. Then, why the fucking grin?! It just felt I was in a film for a minute, sorry. Some of you look a mess. Puffy and pudgy, big bags under your eyes. This isnt the fucking Priory. Are you listening, Dawes? Yeah. This isnt the fucking Priory. 14 bloody weeks. Thats all Ive got to make soldiers out of you lot. Some recruits dont have it in them to complete the course. It isnt easy being a soldier in the British Army. We've got to separate the wheat from the chaff. You understand what I mean by wheat and chaff, King? Not sure, Corporal. We've got to separate the shit from the clay. I only want clay on my hands. The PlayStation generation! Can you hear that noise? Thats the fucking Taliban, shitting themselves! These next few weeks are going to need your absolute concentration and dedication. Those determined enough will pass out. Those that dig deeper than they ever thought they could and find new strengths will pass through. Those that do not give up in the face of adversity will do all right. I promise you that. You want it enough, you will get it. Those that arent 100% focused... ...will fail. I promise you that as well. Right, left! Right left, right, left. Will you lot kindly remember that you are now soldiers! Oi, you! Dyed blond hair! Do not drag your kit along the ground! Pick it up now! Move it, move it! Move it! Oh, Jesus wept! Whats the matter with you? Is it too heavy? Shall I do it for you? Pick it up and move it! Now! Your kit is your responsibility. I want it immaculate at all times. I want it ironed and your boots bulled. You brought plenty of polish, Dawes? Yes, Corporal. And your locker has gotta be like your minds. What do I mean by that, Dawes? Dirty? Everything in its rightful place. Everything 100%. Ordered. Organised. Why? If your lockers not spot on, I'll know nothings spot on. Fail at keeping your locker tidy, youll fail at everything here at Pirbright. And we dont want that, do we, Dawes? Im not here to wipe your arse, Im here to point at your arse and tell you to get the bloody thing wiped. And by week two, I dont even want to be pointing, I shall expect you to know and to have done it yourself already. I shall walk in here at 0600 and I shall inspect your locker and your kit and if theres so much as a crease out of place, youll have to do it again. And again and again. Right, I'll be back in five minutes and I want to see you all in your uniforms, please. And maybe someone should step up to the plate and have a word with your class clown. Jump! Go on! Jump! Hurry up! Come on! Don't wait! Don't hesitate! Straight over! What are you hesitating for? Straight over! Run! Don't wait, just push it over! Come on! Hurry up and get over that wall! What are you doing, Dawes?! Don't fucking start! You want special treatment, do you?! Maybe we could write to the Al-Qaeda and say you dont take bullets. Shall we do that? I have yet to see a gallant bullet, that carefully avoids members of the female sex and targets only men. Come on! Dig in! Give it your best! Are you giving it your best, Dawes? I dont think you are. Come on, push yourself. Find the courage to do this! Only you can find the balls! Two weeks here, youve got worse! Don't be a waste of space! Run! Come on, Dawes, find it! Rise up! Don't get too comfy yet, ladies. Locker inspection. Your lockers should be immaculate at all times and ready for random inspection. Cheers. Troop! Troop! One! Good, lets keep those arms pinned in. Move to the left in file. Left! Turn! One! Two, three, one! Bend your bottom closer to that bench! Stand down! One! Two! Three! One! March! March! March! Hurry up! Run, run, run! One! One! Two, three, one! All of you that pass out will be deployed at some point in the future. Which means, unfortunately, some of you wont be coming home. Take a look around at the faces in this room. Each and every one of you will be missed terribly by your people back home. How anyone will miss some of you pains in the back side is hard to believe, I know. But missed you will most certainly be and thats why you are each tasked to write a letter from the grave for your families. These are private and personal. Hopefully, never to be opened. Your Corporals can offer assistance, if needed. Thats your call. You have to play with your left hand, that is the rule! Hang on, I dont remember anything about that rule. Well, if you want help with your ironing... No, no! We dont need any help with our ironing. Well, that shirt tells me you do. This shirt is casual, its supposed to look... What, like shit? OK, OK. Lets have some order and solemnity here. Chris, left-handed, yeah? Come on! Referees decision is final. Molly, if you lose, youre ironing his kit tonight. And Chris, if you lose, youre bulling her boots. Yeah? Yeah, and I want to see my face in them, sunshine! Go on, Molly! Hang on a minute, youre bloody left-handed! No way! Shes here, shes here. What? Um... Its only one point for a recruit! One point for a recruit, five points for a corporal, ten points for a sergeant, and 50 for a major! Well, Ive just been down the gym, putting a bit of extra... Oh, yeah! Well, we was down the stores watching you collect one point from Chris Ingrams! Yeah! All this exercise is making me double want it! But what about your fella back home? What fella? Besides, what goes on tour... Goes on Facebook! Run! Run! Come on, girls, jump! Jump! Come on! Come on, jump! Lauren! Lauren! Lauren! Lauren, Lauren. Lauren, its Molly! Right, pull her legs up. Shes caught in the webbing. Get the webbing off, get the webbing off. Right, Ive got her weight. Unclip her. Lauren! Lauren! Shes not answering. Lauren! Lauren. Lauren. Hold on. Is she all right? Yeah, shes all right. Youre all right, Lauren. Good work, Dawes. You know, my old man, he said to me, he said, You never forget who youre on basic with. Royal Engineer. Is he still in? Copped it four years ago. Dead! I hope so, we buried him! It was a... IED. Died instantly. Oh, sorry. I know what he means about never forgetting anyone. Your basic training, they just try and break you down. They want you to forget about everything outside and give yourself up to the Army. Its like a cult. They break you down to nothing, make you a no-one. And they build you back up how they want you built. You know, like Frankenstein's monster. That way, they send you off to war and youll do whatever they tell you to do. Kill and not blink an eyelid. Not everyones going to get through here. Them that cant be broken down and rebuilt or are just too weak, booted into touch. If any of my section were under threat, Id take a bullet for them. Well, they got you already, then. Come on, girls, push it! Push it! Faster. Keep pushing it, girls! Faster! Come on, girls! Hurry up! Hurry up! Still got to get there! Keep going, girls! Come on, Katy! Come on! Youre too far back, girl! Come on, keep going! Come on, Katy! In front, harder! Come on, you can do it! Keep pushing it, girls! Keep pushing it! If some of you show that little effort when youre deployed, the chances of you coming back in one piece are pretty fucking remote! Stand by your beds! 06:00 - kit and locker inspection tomorrow morning. Breakfast. Then weapons safety test. If anybody fails, its another eight-mile endurance run, in full kit! Right. As youll have noticed, our numbers are down by two. UFAS. Tell them what that means, if youll be so good, Corporal Geddings. Unfit For Army Service. Those people were showing the wrong attitude and were not fit for purpose. Chris Ingrams, Dawes. Gone. And forgotten. Do you want to join him or stay with us? Stay, Corporal. And Craig Garners gone. Troop! Fall out! The rest of you, get on the mini-bus. And throughout this entire trip, try to remember you are representing Her Majesty's Army. # Seems like everybody's got A price # I wonder how they sleep at night # When the sale comes first And the truth comes second # Just stop for a minute and smile # Why is everybody so serious? # Acting so damn mysterious # You got your shades on your eyes And your heels so high # That you cant even have A good time # Everybody look to their left To their left! # Everybody look to their right # Can you feel that? Yeah! # Well pay them with love tonight # Its not about the money Money, money # We dont need your money Money, money # We just want to make The world dance # Forget about the price tag # Ain't about the... cha-ching Cha-ching # Ain't about the... # Wet the bed? No, Corporal. Youre up early, then. Its the new me! Gagging for a brew, me. D'you fancy one? Is it allowed? I'll bend the rules this once. You must be knackered. Yeah, well, we thought wed just take it easy today. Sleep in this morning, go to the pictures this afternoon. Are you enjoying it? I aint jacking it in if thats what you mean, Corp. Im making the grade. I bet you were a right treasure at school, werent ya? Two of my teachers had nervous breakdowns cos of me. Take someone a lot bigger and badder than you to break us. Arent you trying to break me? No. We want you to be... a part of us. Not the one on the outside trying to... Trying to be the class clown. After my basic training, we were deployed out in Iraq. Our section commander got preliminary orders that we were to secure a building across from the compound. He was told possible enemy direct fire and mine field. He told the section and we all went fine. Except one fella. And he was the one who was always joking... Our class clown. The one on the outside who thought he was better than the system. We ran across the area, he dithered, cacking himself. Only one who got injured. Dithered on a mine. Not a great place to dither. Lost both his legs. What we do, we do to save your life, Molly. You either leave or learn. Why did you get rid of Chris Ingrams? Why d'you think? Rise up! As you were. One volunteer, please. As youre only texting... Come on. If thats bloody Jade saying she cant cope... Who is it? Its Molls. Oh, they've been on an adventure trip. Yeah, on our taxes, no doubt? Well, you dont pay taxes, so youre all right. Shes on to live ammunition now. Its our daughter, shes in the Forces. Wow. Yeah. Oh, God! Just this way. Thank you. He was always a scatter-brain. Left lots of bits here. Nothing... valuable. Just... we want them now. Exposure of the figure twelve target. Fire one five-round group at the target. Rapid fire! One, two, three. One, two, three, one... Who fancies a little bit of mouthwash? Sambuca! Ive been saving it for that special occasion! - You decent? - Yes, Corporal! Rise up! Good evening, ladies. Its late. Thought you might be getting ready for tomorrow mornings inspection! Just about up to standard, Dawes. Why, thank you, Corporal. Ah... Mouthwash. Do you mind if I borrow this? You seem to forget that I went through basic training too! I know everything. Including what some people get up to behind the stores. So is that your natural colour, then? Brown. Dark chestnut! Good, Corporal. Thank you, Sergeant. One Section down to seven. Three Section down to eight. Still at your full compliment here, Corporal. Just. Enjoy your leave. Don't spend your entire time pissed. Keep up the fitness. Ill see you in a week. Thank you, Sergeant. Don't look too bloody smug just yet. Long way to go before you pass out. Right, lets get our civvies on! You all right? Come on, the mini bus is on the station. You know what theyre like, they wont wait. Im not going home, Molls. What you chatting about, you nut bar? Im not going home, Molly. Ive cleared it with the Corporal. Theyre going to give me light duties around the barracks. Why arent you going home? They dont really want me back and, to be honest, that is fine with me. Who dont? Your mum dont? Well, her new boyfriend. She said... Well, she reckons it might for be the best. In case it causes arguments. Which it would, so... This is me home. Right. Get your glad rags on, lady... London Town, here we come. You dont want me coming back with you. I just said I do. Yeah, but you dont, so... I wouldnt bullshit you. Dawes! How you getting on with your letter home? Im about to go see them. Write it! Left, right! Left, right! Left, right! Left, right! Were going to have to do so much drill when we get back. Have you ever been abroad before? Oh, yeah, were quite sophisticated in Lancashire! I never have. What, like not even in Spain? Not even Wales! The first time I step on a plane, itll be to Afghanistan. Oh! My big girls come home to mummy! Lets have a look at the little sproglet! Oh, he looks like Dad, poor fella! He dont, he looks like me, dont he, Mum? Well, hes got a bit of everybody in him. Look at you, Molls! Look at you! What? I dunno. You look all... All... I dunno! Oh, Mum, this is my mate, Katy! Shes coming to stay. All right, Katy? We thought it was you! Welcome home! What d'you mean, you thought it was me? We was on the bus and we thought we saw you walking down the road with your friend. Oh, my mate, Katy. Army. Top girl. All right, Katy. So, we on a girlie night out tonight or what? Yeah, sounds like a plan, Stan! Im all right, thanks, Mar. Im off them as it goes. Molly! Molly! Hello! Oh, here she is! I cant believe your hair! Dye it again, you look too different! I been dying it since I was 11, thought it was about time I went natural! Look at your hands, Molly. They gone like cuttle fish! Don't go near my budgie, he'd fucking eat them! And wheres them beautiful nails!? Not... regulation. When did you start taking orders? Are we going to get ruined tonight or what?! Get in there, get in there, get in there, get in there. Three, two, one! I been at work. Shower. Then come here. How did you know I was here? Your dad said. Artan! There you go, fella. Whats going on there? Your dad knew I wanted to see you. He hates you. Have you missed me? You didnt ring. Its tricky. This is my friend, from training. Hi. Were getting married. Lets talk. Don't go back. I dont really want to leave Katy on her own for too long. Don't go back to training. You know what I mean. I want to. I dont want you to. Oh, dont you?! Molly, I know I havent always loved you well... What, you mean shagging other people? I always come back to you. You are my love. You are my heart. Is that a fact? I have to marry you because you are me. What the fuck does that mean? Without you... I am not me. I am someone else, someone less. With you, baby, I am man. I am proud. Its happened already, yes? What? Theyre training you to hate us. Don't be a dickhead. Will you fucking stop doing that?! What? Always grabbing my face! You dont get to touch my face anymore! Why not? Just go away. Whats going on? What do you mean, whats going on? Hes been bang up for you coming home and youre treating him like shit. Whats going on with you?! I said Id make sure things were smooth between you. Whats it gotta do with you? Were helping each other out and that. Oh, shut up! Molly, go back inside and be nice. Show him a bit of respect. What is all this shit about respect?! Why dont you go in there and you treat him with a bit of respect?! You dont talk to me like that, understand?! Hes doing me a favour. Oh, God! What? Whats it gotta do with you? Well, obviously quite a lot if hes doing you a favour and Im part of the deal. Youre going to marry him anyway, what difference does it make if he thinks Im the one allowing it? Allowing it? You what? You butt out, love, yeah? So youre my pimp now, Dad, is that right? Just fucking marry him, Molly. For Daddy. You know, thats exactly what were fighting for in Afghanistan. What? So that women can have a say in who they marry or if they want to get married at all. What a load of bullshit! Were out there fighting to show the ragheads were no fucking pushover. Look, Molls, we've come up with a way to make us... Well, not rich, but sorted. You and Artan? Exactly. They've taken me off the sick, Im back on Job Seekers. I cant afford to feed the family any more. Imagine how that makes me feel, Moll. Ive got a start with a Russian firm building on Aldgate. Artan's got a cousin working there. Now, if I can persuade you to marry him, his cousins going to put a nail gun through my hand. I mean, brilliant or what? Now, say youll marry him. Fucking hell, Dad, has the booze finally done your last brain cell in!? Youre off your nut! Thats how much you know, then. Ill get a huge wedge compensation from the Russians and I'll be on the sick for life. We've thought it all through and all youve got to do... And if you dont... If you dont, Moll, there'll be very serious repercussions for the whole family! Yeh, you want that, eh? I promise you, you wont see any of us again. Not your mum, not your bothers or your sisters. Thats a fact. Fine. You dont want to see me, fine. Ill see Mum. Oh, no, you wont, shes 100% behind me because shes a proper wife. Like youre going to be. I mean, you join the Army, youre happy to get your head blown off for England, youre saying you wont do a simple thing for your own flesh and blood? Ready? When you are. Just going to fuck off, then, yeah? Without saying nothing. It aint like that. Don't give it like youre anything special! Youre in the Army! Anyone can join the fucking Army. They let her in for starters! Yeah. We aint good enough for you no more. Wrong, bitch! Youre not good enough for us anymore! Come on, Mar, lets go. Loser! Theres things I know and theres things you dont know I know. Yeah? Whats that supposed to mean? I'll put it this way. Once upon a time, Id have knocked your teeth down your throat. But why should I make you better looking? Come on! One, two, three! Two, one, two! Guess what? Go on. This lot... ...needs sorting and putting in the stores. Sorry, guys. Another few bits. Do you want us to unload that trolley, Corp? These are previously enjoyed. Theyll need going through the laundry first. Then ironed, ladies. And there was me thinking wed go into town for a Ruby later. Right, I'll take that below and do it. You keep stacking, Molly Dawes. Stop looking at me. I know I look a mess. You look a lot better than when you first arrived! You flirting? Ive got a duty of care. Flirting verboten. I wont say nothing. Here, pass us them boxes, please, Corp. But I do understand it must be hard for you to control yourself when youre around me, Dawes. Oh! Dream on, Corp. As it happens, its pretty obvious that youre proper loved up with me. How d'you work that one out, then? You UFAS-ing Chris Ingrams. What, you reckon that was down to you and him? Can I tell you that was absolutely nothing to do with you and him? He was a good soldier, you know that. Youre joking. His attitude stank. And all that crap that he was saying in the canteen was not on. How do you know what he was saying to me in the canteen? All that about brain washing and like were a cult. He thought he was cleverer than the system. No-one is. So he was right - it is like a cult. Its a family. You write that letter? Dawes? Yes, Sergeant. Stand easy. Bit of bad news, Im afraid. Your fathers had an accident at work. They've taken him to hospital, but your mother informs me hes going to be fine. Sergeant... If its all right with you, Corporal, I think we can excuse Dawes the Realities Of War tour and she can have a few days compassionate. Fine. Excuse me, Sergeant. I want to go on the trip, please. Thank you. Nine different regiments stood shoulder to shoulder to fend off the German advance. They knew that had the Germans broken through, the allied position would have been nigh on impossible. And life in the trenches - often up to your thighs in foul, rancid, rat-infested water. And these rats were huge, they had so much waste and dead human flesh to feast on. And then, there was the mustard gas, which caused great mustard-coloured blisters. Your eyes would be glued shut. The gas would attack the lungs, making every breath an agonising fight until after four of five weeks, the poison would eventually kill you, giving the rats even more carrion to devour. Every one of these graves tells us a story, not just of some brave Tommy, but of a brother, a father, a son who died doing what they saw was their duty - their service to the nation. In Flanders fields The poppies blow. Between the crosses, row on row. That mark our place. And in the sky. The larks, still bravely singing Fly. Scarce heard amid the guns below. We are the dead. Scarce days ago. We lived, felt dawn Saw sunset glow. Loved and were loved. And now we lie. In Flanders fields. Take up our quarrel with the foe: To you from failing hands we throw. The torch, be yours to hold it high. If ye break faith with us who die. We shall not sleep. Though poppies grow. In Flanders fields. Who was that? Oh, its my sister. I didnt feel like chatting. Mum, its only me. I just wanted to hear your voice. D'you want a cup of tea? If that was Molly, shes been told. We dont want nothing to do with her no more. Yeah, I know. If she ever rings, you put the phone straight down, yeah? Yes. Have nothing to do with the selfish mare. And I just wanted you to know that I love you. You will come to passing out, wont you, Mum? Please try, its a big deal. Its important. Turn! General salute! Present arms! Devastating blast by just one man wearing a suicide belt. Al-Qaedas weapon of choice. Undetected by security... This is Private Dawes, shes joining the Royal Army Medical Corps. Private Dawes, good morning. How are you? Very well, sir. And all the very best. Thank you, sir. Well done. Not out celebrating with your family? Can I stay here tonight? I start at Keogh tomorrow. Exactly, so dont you want to...? I know what every second would be like till the morning. I got my next lot of recruits coming in tomorrow morning. Does your duty of care prevent you from necking a bottle of warm flat lemonade with me? I think I'll be able to square that with the Ministry of Defence. I feel strange. Youll do fine. First impressions, remember. No gobbing off on day one. Me? Six months corps and then the real thing. Can you drink in Afghanistan? No chance. I just wanted to say thanks. Im a soldier, Corporal! Only fucking just. Ah, I thought you might be hiding. Im not hiding, Im just... getting my stuff together and that. My Aunties driving me up to Birmingham. Oh! Look after yourself, Katy. I will. Keep in touch, OK? Rumour has it, you can go on Facebook at Keogh, so... watch out! We only bleeding done it! The next 14 weeks, I am your mother, father, boyfriend, grandma and your bloody God all rolled into one. You are mine, and, more importantly, I am yours. The next weeks are going to need your absolute concentration and dedication. Those determined enough will pass out. Those that dig deeper than they ever thought they could and find new strengths, will pass through. Those that do not give up in the face of adversity will do all right. You want it enough, you will get it. I promise you that. Hello, Zero. This is Charlie Two One. Contact! Wait out! Help! Please help! Help! Help! Keep still, Private. Keep still. Good lad. Lie still as you can. Im going to get you out of here, OK? Keep looking at me. Im going to get you out of here, OK? I'll be right back, you understand? How you doing, Corporal? Ive lost my foot. I know youre my section commander, but right now, Im in charge, I need you to man up. All right, man up! See, what did I tell you? Im right back. Hello, Zero. This is Charlie Two One. One T1 to one T2. Insurgents! Right, I need to get you back to the Jeep. Good work, Private. Thanks, Sarge. So, why d'you pick the Private? Well, he lost both legs, was losing a lot of blood. The other lad lost a foot, but he was fully conscious. I had to make a decision quickly. Thanks, lads. Go and get yourselves some scoff and pick up your Oscars once youve eaten, yeah? You know, you dont just go to who screams the loudest. No, Sarge. I wanted to tourniquet the Private before I jumped on the Corporal. What about me? Took full impact of the blast, assessed unable to survive. No, seriously, when you was screaming your nut off, I thought something had really happened! Private Dawes! You got a visitor, down the guard room. Mum! Whats the matter? Whats happened? Nothing. Well, what you doing here, then? Oh, charming. I dont mean it like that, its just... I wanted to see you. Thats all right, isnt it? How did you get here? Train. Why didnt you let me know?! Does Dad know youre here? No. Where does he think you are? Taking the baby up the hospital for his six-month check. We were there all day last time! You look well. Knackered. They working you hard? Well, you know, theres a lot to learn. That phone call... What phone call? Cant remember. I had to see you, Molly. Cant remember a phone call. I must have been pissed. You never come to passing out. It was difficult with your dad. Does he hate me? Cor, he loves you, Molly. And hows the baby? As big a pain in the arse as the rest of us six? Yeah, carrying on a fine family tradition! We all look out for each other here, Mum. I had to see you, Molly. I had to touch you. Don't set me off, Mum. You know what Im like. Do you have to go? I want to go. Oh, God! God, it was weird climbing those steps. When we knew wed be stepping out into a different world. All that training, Mum. All those months making me... me. And this was it, this was what it was all for. I was proud to sit with each and every soul. Good people. Every time Im out on patrol, I think of you back home. Back home seems a long way away right now, but its never been so crisp and clear and perfect in my mind. If I listen carefully, I can hear the kids playing, laughing. Like when you put a shell to your ear and you think you can hear the sea. Maybe you do! Cos I can hear all you lot right now. Tell the kids I love them. The little bleeders. I love being out on patrol. I love Afghanistan. The sounds, the smells, the heat on my skin. Nothing worries me anymore, Mum, Ive got it sorted. Anyway, if youre reading this, it means they got me. They get us to write these letters from the grave. Seems mad to think that I wont ever see you again. I didnt want to write, but my Corporal said there'd be a Molly-sized hole in your heart if I was killed. I dont want a hole in your heart, Mum. Your heart is way too good to have any hole in it. Anyway, lets hope I died gallantly. Lets hope they've spooned me into a body bag after doing something heroic. Its funny to think that the thing that made me into some sort of decent human being has been the death of me. But, its better this way, isnt it? Does that make any sense? It is better to have done something, been someone, have my name read out by the Prime Minister, isnt it? Soldiers killed in Afghanistan... I love you, Mum. Tell Dad I love him, too. Our girl will be all right. Serving in the Helmand Province have been withdrawn until next year. The Prime Minister came here to tell the British troops that within months... The war in Afghanistan is coming to an end, but after 11 years of conflict, at what price?
