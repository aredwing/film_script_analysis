I believe that God predetermined all our emotional relationships. But then He left it to us to find each other. He made us all couples and for every one of us... there is a soulmate. A soulmate? What nonsense! I don't believe in all this... I' m absolutely sure that somewhere, someone was made for me... and that someday I shall certainly meet him. OK, but will someone please tell me... how will I know who was made for me? I mean, will she be wandering about with a placard with my name on it? When I see her, will there be a clap of thunder and a flash of lightning? How will I recognise her? I don't know what others will do, but I will recognise him. He will speak to me, He will give me a sign... and my heart will realise that this is him. What is all this? This is love Love! However far apart they may be... Their paths will meet, whatever happens,... When two people are made for each other. Made for each other. The Heart Is Crazy Like the heart and its beat- Made for each other. Like the eye and its sight - Made for each other. Like the monsoon and the rain - Made for each other. One lover, one beloved Made for each other Made for each other When God gave them a heart,... It was one heart in two pieces. He wrote one name on both,... He wrote ' Radha' and ' Krishna'. Now these hearts beat together, They come together and they part. When two people are made for each other. I don't know when, Like a silent thief,... I don't know when, like a silent thief... The first look of love... Took my heart away In love's very first game of hide N seek... I hid myself in the shelter of his eyes. Now I' m frightened... ...because like a silent thief,... the first look of love... Took my heart away My hair disheveled, I walk like I' m drunk If anyone sees me They will ask what's up. How can I go home like this? Jimmy, get Rahul. Rahul's not here. Go and look for him then! And fast! I' ll be right back. - Shruti, have you seen Rahul? - No, I haven't. I don't know when, like a silent thief... the first glance of love... took my heart away. Rahul! How often have I told you that I get anxious when you' re late... Sorry, Nisha, I got this idea at the last minute... and I thought that if I shoot out of the stage... the audience will freak out and that's what happened. What's the fuss all about? Look here, Rahul,... I' m fed up with your last minute entries Hey kid, I' m the director. I do what I want. I can change whomever I like, even you. Yeah, but you' ll never get another dancer like me. If I want I can get Shruti to dance. Nisha! Fight with Rahul later please. It's time to go on stage. Take the mike. I want to thank you all very much... for making this dance show such a big success. As you all know, this is the last night of this show. However, I promise you that we' ll be back in three months... with a new story, new songs and a new name. Yes, `Maya' is the name of our new dance show. Rahul, this new play ' Maya'... what's it all about? Tell us. Yes! Tell us about it! Okay... I don't know. What?! If you didn't know that, then why did you tell everyone... that we' ll do a new show called `Maya'... and that we' ll do it in three months? Now look, even I don't know who or what Maya is. But I do know that in three months, we' ll do a show called `Maya'. Do you have in mind a girl who's like Maya? Right now, Maya is not even in my perception. Hey, Nisha! I've got a girl in mind. Rahul! aren't you talking about Pami, the Colonel's daughter? Rahul, are you in love with a girl like Maya? No, I' m not in love with anyone but lots of girls love me. But Maya is the kind of girl that anyone would love. Maya is the kind of girl for whom you would leave even Soni. You'd better watch out if you cheat on my sister. Ballu, shut up. What does she do? She spins dreams. Is Maya beautiful? Very. This Maya must do something... Maya dances,... but only for herself. Excuse me, but she is a feeling, a fantasy, beautiful,... and a dancer. But we've got to find her in three months. So who is she? Maya is all these things and yet she is only Maya. We've gone around in circles and we' re back where we started. Are you trying to make us look dumb? I've done chores all my life! But I' ll decide this today! Silly girl! where were you? - I was outside. - Now you have to come with me. I' m tired of the promises your uncle makes everyday. So, today we' re going to have a fight and you have to take my side. Bravo, bravo! What a performance! Wonderful! Panditji,... excuse me, Panditji Go on, Chandni.... er, Shanti Please allow us to have a teabreak. Break whatever you want. Please allow me to have a word with your students. By all means. Watchman! Gardener! Shankar and Ramu, if you don't mind, perhaps you'd all get back to work! Where are you going? Why are you driving away my audience? Please be quiet. You gather the servants here so they can't get on with their work! I have to do it all by myself. As of today, no music recitals. From today... only you will sing and only you will listen. No audience. Even in my own house my songs aren't appreciated. So how will others appreciate them? Because of your aunt's behavior, I never became a great singer. I know, I know... Now have a cup of tea. No, I don't want any tea. Have a cup of tea... and sing a song for me. Will you listen to my song? - Really? - Certainly. So let me have the tea! Here, this is your parcel. It's from Ajay! There must be a cassette in there. - Hear my song first. - Later, uncle... please! See that? You have always driven away my audience! What are you dreaming about? I was thinking how fast time flies. It seems like yesterday that Mr. Khanna and Geeta... had that accident and Pooja came to our house. And now, it seems as if we have no existence without her. And I have never seen such close friends as Pooja and Ajay. Hey, fatty! How are you? Shut up, I' m not fat. I've heard that nowadays you' re really packing your food away. Don't do that or no one will marry you! Idiot! Don't worry about my marriage! Who's going to marry you? By now, you must have finished cursing me. So I' ll proceed. I' m having fun, as usual, and work and girls are keeping me busy. Tell you what? I never realised how handsome I am. Oh really!! Don't make faces. If you wish I can fax you a list of my girlfriends. For your information, I've left Tina because she doesn't like Hindi films. Thank God. She was really stupid.. - And now my heart is elsewhere... - Who is she? Don't yell, I' m telling you. She's called Dolly. There's no need to worry. She really likes Hindi movies. And yes, I forgot to tell you something. I may be coming to Bombay for a few days. - When?! - There's no need to stand,... Sit down. It's not fixed as yet. As soon as I get to know, I' ll tell you. OK, I' m off. Dolly is coming and even though you haven't told me... - I' ll give her your love. - There's no need. OK, I won't... Hey! Here she comes! OK, I' m going,... Give mum and dad my love! Hey Nisha, where've you put that cassette you took from my car? You know there was a really important track on it of our play. Anything that goes into your room vanishes forever. You have no manners. You must knock before coming into a girl's room. Is there a girl here? I am! Stupid! And seriously... Look, don't talk to me in this girly girly way. Please! You have also entered my room when I had nothing on. So? - That's different. - Why is it different? Go on now,... get my cassette. First say sorry, then you' ll get the cassette. - Must I say sorry?! - Yes. - Say sorry to you? - Yes. I' ll fix you, Nisha! Come on, give me back my cassette! - Give it to me! - I won't! - Now say you' re sorry! - Sorry for what? Sorry that you've wasted my time and made me run. - I won't say I' m sorry. - Say sorry! And quickly say that you won't annoy me ever again. - I' ll never annoy you! - Say: Rahul is the best. Never... Okay! Rahul is the best. Whatever happens I shan't dance in your play! So be it. There are plenty of dancers like you! There's no one who dances like me! Pooja... my marriage has been arranged. Marriage?! Anjali, what's up with you? You' re going to marry someone... you haven't chosen? Someone you hardly know?! I do know him. He's the son of Mr. Kapoor. I've known him for years. But you don't love him. Well, Pooja,... Iove will happen in due course. What are you saying, Anjali? We' re not children any more, Pooja. It's time we emerged from our world of fantasies. We are lndian girls. The lovers of our dreams and our husbands are not the same. Someone else chooses our husbands for us. We learn to love them. This is the truth and... the sooner you realise it, the better. Don't make this mistake, Anjali. Someone, somewhere is made for you and you should wait for him. Perhaps this one is him. I' m sure that this is the one who was made for me. And who knows? This might happen to you. Tomorrow you might marry a man whom you merely know... and slowly you might realise that he was the one you were waiting for. Nothing like this will happen to me. I' ll choose my husband myself. There can't be a girl like this. Meaning? Rahul, this character is a mistake... and Maya exists only in your dreams. Modern girls aren't like this. What do you know? You' re not a girl. Maya is not one of these modern girls. She's something else... She is my Maya. Your Maya, indeed! What do you know about girls? You know only one. And that's me! What do you mean? I don't know anything about love... and yet I' m making this love story. What of it? Rahul, your Maya is really crazy. Don't you call my Maya crazy! You are the only one who feels this. - Nobody else is saying anything. - Definitely! Rahul, I think Nisha is right. I don't understand this Maya character either. Her character seems false. Looking at it from a psychological point of view... I' m sure that you' re on your own trip. - Do you also want to say something? - I think we need a lunchbreak. Look, I don't know if there is such a girl or not... and I don't want to know. Whether she is a lie, a fantasy or mad or whatever... If you cannot understand this, I am very sorry. I can't do anything about this, but... under no circumstances am I going to change the character of Maya. I think Rahul's right. You shut up. You are Rahul's yes man. - I was only saying that.... - Okay... what were you saying? Do you know of such a girl? Is your Soni like this? No. Do you understand the character of Maya? - No. - Should we do this play? That's exactly what I have been saying! But... An innocent face... Mischief in her eyes... Oh my! An innocent face; mischief in her eyes.... She stands far away from me, looking shy. Oh my! She lets me catch a glimpse of her face, then she turns away. If you look with my eyes, friend, you can see her. She's no ordinary girl, she's a magical being. What else can I say to describe her. Last night she appeared in my dreams, her hair flowing wildly. When I woke up, I wished I could go back to my dream. If this how I feel without meeting her,... what will happen when I do? Her eyeliner is dark like the first cloud of the rainy season She moves like a wave on the ocean. From what special substance did God make her body? I wish that one-day, magically, she becomes a reality. Perhaps you haven't noticed but everyone is staring at us. So what? I don't care. I' ll be back in a moment. Have you come shopping? Alone? Very good! Never make the mistake of going shopping with a girl. - Do you like it? - I like it very much. I like it very, very much too. Let's go. Once you've tried it on. You like it and I like it... Let's go, please. To hell with Rahul! - What did you say? - Nothing, nothing at all. Off you go! Who is it? Why are you laughing? What's up? Where are your jeans? Come on, I' m wearing my jeans. It happens, y' know. Who's there? Crazy! Everybody clap... Open the cake box. How did this happen? What happened and when did it happen? How did this get swapped over? I had ordered a chocolate cake. You've brought someone else's parcel. I' m so stupid! I should have checked. It's all right, dear. Other people celebrate their birthdays by cutting a cake. I' ll celebrate mine by cutting sandwiches. Let me see who got my cake. - Who's this Pooja? - I don't know. - And who's this uncle? - Must be Pooja's uncle. The first time I send you to do something... and you go and get the boxes mixed up. What have I done? I brought the parcel the shopkeeper gave me. But you should have checked. Excuse me, but it wasn't up to me to check. Next time, do it yourself. I am hungry. This cake looks really good. - No one's eating this cake. - Why not? Because it belongs to someone else. They must be eating eating our sandwiches, too... There's an address written here. It's nearby. Go and deliver it. Have you gone mad? Rahul, this is someone's birthday cake. It was ordered with love for that person. Someone's party will be ruined. Go and give it back. I' m not going. Rahul be damned! Jimmy, let's go and give it back and say `Happy Birthday!'. - What did you say? - Nothing. Good evening. Are you uncle? No, I' m aunty. Actually, by mistake I got your cake, aunty. The sandwich man! That's right. Here's your cake... Wishing you a happy birthday. Thank you and sorry. Why sorry? Because I've eaten your sandwiches. That's all right. Actually, I ate a bit of your cake on the way here. No wonder...! OK, I' ll be off Uncle No. Come in and have some cake. No thanks. I've got something to do. I' m in a hurry. Just a minute. Just one minute Let the person who bought this cake, thank you. That poor man, whose sandwiches you picked up by mistake... has brought the cake back. Go and thank him. He's at the door. The cake has brought a twinkle in my eyes... and a musical rhythm to the strings of my heart Strange man. Why are you buying all this stuff? Oh, Anjali... Today is Valentine's Day Don't you know about Valentine's Day? The man you love most in the world is called your Valentine. On this day, all lovers tell each other... about all the love they have in their hearts. This is all about love. You won't understand. But whom are you buying all these things for? - For myself. - What? You see, I don't have a lover. So there's no one to buy me all these lovely things. I' m doing this for my own pleasure. You've gone quite mad. Do you know, today isn't an ordinary Valentine's Day. After many years, today it falls on the same day as the full moon. Do you know what this means? I don't, but I' m sure you' re going to tell me. It means that if you believe that someone is made for you... and you are waiting for him with a true heart,... you will certainly meet him today. And you really believe this? Of course, I' m absolutely sure that before midnight today... I shall meet my soulmate. Pooja! You' re really mad! That I am. I' m going home. If you want to come with me, then come on. Rahul, we all came together and we' ll all go together. This is a very boring party. If you want to come, then come on. Rahul, you don't get any better. See, it's such a beautiful night... and you' re so unromantic. Look, everyone's so much in love. You think that they' re all in love? Sit down. Tell me something, Nisha. You think you know what love is? Love is when you' re so fond of someone, that your heart tells you... you want to spend your whole life in his arms. That's what we call love. You think the people here want to spend the rest of their lives... - with each other? - I think so. Girls are so daft. Do you know, most of these romances will be over before tomorrow? They' ll fight over small things... and will never see each other after tonight. And next year, you will see the same faces,... at the same places in different arms. - Boys are also really stupid. - I' m telling you the facts, Nisha. You must realise that you need to know someone really well... - to spend your life together. - That's right. And in order to know someone well you need to spend time together? True. In today's world, whose got the time? Look; among all these party guests, no one's known each other... for as long as we've known each other. Does that mean that we can spend a lifetime with each other? Come on, don't just accept what I' m saying,... but just tell me, could you spend your whole life with me? Here you are, Rahul! And everyone wants you outside! Why? The thing is, my friend, people here want to hear you sing a song. - No way! - Oh, come on! Tell me, could you spend your whole life with me? Yes, Rahul. I could spend it with you. I could spend my whole life with you. The moon whispered something... which the night heard... The moon whispered something, which the night heard... Did you hear,... It said " fall in love " The moonlight came to my street and to my house, To say " fall in love " What can I say, what can I do, This strange thing that has happened to me. It is a sign or did my heart whisper " fall in love " There is someone, I don't know who. But I am certain that there is someone. He is somewhere in my dreams, but I cannot see him I am here... he is somewhere there Then whose voice was it... that said " fall in love " I have given my love to him, he does not know. How can I call him unfaithful, he does not know. I have tried to say so much, he does not hear. Oh my sad heart, be careful... when you " fall in love " You' re really crazy. Is there something wrong with your brain? Going home like this without telling anyone! You said we had come together and we'd all leave together. Then you go and run away all on your own. You know that we' re all worried. You stupid idiot! Er.. this is not 6 7 1 1 2 3 7, is it? No. I' m sorry, I thought it was someone else. You' re right. I am someone else. Please excuse me. It's OK. Hang on, one minute,... don't hang up the phone. Yes? The music you' re playing... that's Pundit Shiv Kumar Sharma's new album, isn't it? Yes. I just love it. Actually, you know, I wanted to buy it. - Where did you buy it from? - `Rhythm House'. I haven't been there. Do you think they would have it in stock? How would I know? Oh right, stupid me,... how would you know? You don't work there. I' m really sorry about all this. Nice voice. How could you do this to me?! You scared the hell out of me! Now I' m not going to give up until I've got you. Wait till I get my hands on you! How about it? Ballu! What are you up to? Why, what's wrong, Rahul? I told you that after this drum roll is over,... the spotlight should move from me to Nisha. - And I thought... - Shut up. Come on, Nisha,... do it again. What? - Please pack up early today. - Why? What's special about today? Nothing. Come on. Good. C' mon, everybody. Let's take it from the top. Rahul, you forgot? Today is her birthday. Really? Why didn't someone tell me? Why didn't you tell me? There are some things, Rahul, which one knows without being told. Even then...you people should have said something. Honestly, you guys are the limit... You've been forgetting my birthday all these years. This is just another year. Stop putting on an act and take us all out to dinner. What is it? You remembered! So why didn't you say it? There are some things which one knows without being told. Come on, let's rehearse! What are you guys drinking? - I want some. - This isn't for ladies. So relax. No, I want some. I told you that this isn't suitable for you! Today's my birthday. I' ll do as I please. OK... suit yourself. Give me another glass. Nothing. You' re in love? Give over! I know your kind of love. It changes every week. Not my kind of love,... but your kind of love. The marrying kind? Really? Who's the girl. Do I know her? Really well. Tell me who she is, please! - Must l? - Shoot! Forget it. That hurts! Didn't I tell you? It's not for ladies! Please, Ajay! Tell me who she is! Right then. We' ll do this. See that waiter? - Which one? - The one serving the water. - So? - Keep looking at him. If there's still a glass of water on that tray... by the time he gets to our table then I' ll tell you her name. Excuse me! A glass of water, please! That's cheating. You can't do that. Don't say anything. Say nothing at all... Take my shoes and give me money. I' m afraid. Don't leave me I' m scared It's really late. Now quietly go to sleep! Good night! First promise me that you won't leave me. OK, baby, I shan't leave you alone. You won't leave me, even if I ask for an ice-cream, will you? No, I won't. You won't leave me, even if I don't dance well... will you? No, I won't. Not even if I call you names... donkey, monkey... will you? Of course, I won't. You won't leave me, even if I tell you that I love you... will you? There she is... still asleep! Come on, Pooja! It's seven in the morning! The sun is up, Pooja. What the hell...! What are you up to, you idiot? Is this the way to wake someone up? I' m so sorry, but seeing you fast asleep, I just couldn't resist it! How could I miss out on such an opportunity? Listen, get ready quickly. We've got to go to the airport. Airport? Are you going somewhere? No. WE are going somewhere. WE? And where are we going? Well, it's not far from lndia, it's very near. We' ll return by tonight's flight. Get ready quickly! I can't understand a word of what you' re saying! It's very simple. I have to go on some business. It will take me just an hour, just sign some papers and then I am free. If you come along, you' ll see a new city as well as do some shopping. And anyway I am leaving for London tomorrow. That leaves only today... which I want to spend with you. But Ajay, I must find out if it's okay with Uncle and Aunty. I've already got their approval. It's only you who has to decide! So fatty, are you coming or not? - Of course, I am coming! - Then hurry up and get ready. - The flight is on time. - Wait a minute.... - What's that under your eye? - Where...? Now wait, you fatty...! Never mind. I' ll get you for this. Come and get me. You' re going shopping, aren't you? We' ll see! The heart is crazy, the heart is mad. The heart is crazy, the heart is mad. The very first time lovers meet, it sets their bodies on fire. Very slowly it teaches love, it makes them laugh, and it makes them cry. It keeps them awake all night, it steals the sleep from their eyes It shows true and false dreams,... it makes them laugh, and it makes them cry. Those who follow the heart are known to be crazy They discover their destination, but cannot find the path. I don't need to see his face, I don't need to know his name either. I don't need to think or worry, because my heart will know him. We all listen to what the heart says,... the heart doesn't listen to anyone, I've given my life to him, yet everyone knows, but he. So be it, give up these stories, all these signs of madness, All people's worries are all thanks to this crazy heart. Well, Ajay Sahib,... it's time for you to go. Now I have to go. Did you say something? Pooja, I want to say something to you. Say what you want to say. This quick business trip of a couple of days was all a pretence. I came here for something else. It's been eight years since I left lndia. In these years I've earned enough of respect and money. But life has been too hectic. I want to settle down now. And whenever I close my eyes... to think whom I would like to spend the rest of my life with... it is always your face that I see. I don't know how or when my feelings for you turned to love. But I don't know anything about your mind. Or if there is anyone in your life or not. That is what I came here to find out. I don't know what you think about me. I don't even know if you would want to spend your whole life with me. But I know for sure that I love you and I want to marry you. I' m going towards the departure gate. Once I've got there I' ll turn round and look. If your answer is yes, then you' ll be standing here. And if you' re not here then I' ll understand. And one more thing. Don't forget that whatever your decision is,... we were friends, we are friends, and we' ll always be friends. And who knows, tomorrow it may also happen to you. Perhaps you will marry a man whom you only know... but whom you don't love. Then you will realise later that he was the man... for whom you were waiting. But why did you keep standing there? Sometimes I' m so happy when I make someone else happy... that I can't think of anything else. You should have seen his face, Anjali! He was so happy. I have never seen him so happy ever before. And your happiness? You don't love him, Pooja! Love will happen in due course and we are lndian girls. We can't choose our own husbands... so someone else chooses our husbands for us. We learn to love them. Isn't that true? At last you have left your girlish dreams and become a woman. No, Anjali. The girl has become a woman,... but she has not given up her dreams. She believes in them completely, even now. She is sure that Ajay is the one for whom she was always waiting,... and perhaps it was HE who was taking HlS time to show her. I' m certain that Ajay will make you very happy. - Hi, doctor... - There's no need to worry. It's a small fracture. She' ll go home in a week or so. I told you Nisha would start dancing again in a week. I was talking about going home, not about dancing. She won't be able to dance for about three months. Three months? Yes, Rahul. Her heel is very delicate. If she doesn't take care then this fracture could recur... and it could be more serious. Does she know this. May I see her? Of course. You don't need my permission. Whose going to get me a cup of tea? God! You won't learn to knock. Don't give me a lecture. I have something very important to discuss. Okay, what is it? Can you see me properly? How many fingers? See, your Doctor Kapoor isn't up to much, in my opinion. Get a check-up with another doctor. Why? This doctor was talking about getting you discharged in a week. - So what? - No, no I can't allow this. It's been difficult getting you admitted into a hospital. You should spend at least a month or two in here. And while you are away, we' ll also have some peace. You' re always making fun of me. I hate you. She has gone mad with the pain,... I' m sorry that I've put you to so much of trouble. You've taken all the money from the sponsor... and how will you get a dancer so quickly? And for three months, l.... There's no need for you to worry. Why do you think you' re such a good dancer? In this town there are many such dancers. But you' ll never get... We' ll never get another dancer like you. Now you don't worry about this. You have a nice rest and I' ll come see you in the evening. I' ll bring some food. We' ll eat together. Why are you worried? It will all work out. How will it all work out? We've taken money from the sponsors and paid a deposit for the stadium. And most of all, where will we get another dancer like Nisha? Come on, friends, if we try, do you think we can't find one good dancer? These days there are so many dance schools. There is one close to our rehearsal hall. We' ll find a dancer there tomorrow. How about that, Rahul? Come on! Relax! Whatever happens will be for the best. Let's go and have some cold beer. No, thanks. You go ahead. I' m not in the mood. Lay off, he's tired. Come on, let's go. Maya, I' ll find her. Water, water... The sandwich man! Shanti... has a parcel come here by mistake? I haven't come for a parcel today. Then tell me what I can do for you. - I want to meet your daughter. - I don't have a daughter. - No daughter? - No. Then sir, this Miss Pooja Malhotra... Pooja is like my daughter. But how do you know her? I saw her last night. Last night? Where? In the dancing school. She dances beautifully. - And so? - So, I wanted to meet her. - Why? - I wanted to ask her something. - What did you want to ask her? - Sort of, would she, with me.. - With you...what? - If she wanted to work with me. What work? I' m doing a play and I' m looking for a dancer. You are doing a play. Are you a director? Yes. I am sorry. I am sorry! Why didn't you say that in the first place? I said so, when you asked me. - Actually, I am a singer. - I see. I've done years of practice. As it happens with many great artistes,... you really don't meet many connoisseurs. You've met me today. You don't know how lucky you are! Sir, I have come to meet Pooja. Now that you have met me, you will meet Pooja, too! I won't give you more than seventy-five rupees. Eighty rupees. No less. Only last week I bought it at that price. This is the right price. Taste it and see how sweet it is. I will give you only seventy-five Rupees. - Show me the watermelon. - Here you are, sir. Seventy-five is the right price. How many do you want, Madam? - Just one. Pack this for Madam. But... It's your first sale in the day. And you' re haggling for 5 bucks! Be a sport! Recognise me? We met last night at your dancing school. Remember? You must have heard of me? - No. - Well, never mind. Actually you are a pretty good dancer. Actually, I' m doing some music shows and I need a special dancer... for a special role. When I saw you dancing yesterday... I thought that you would be ideal for this. So what do you think? Would you be interested? - No thanks. - I've had it! Damn the watermelon! My career's at stake! Excuse me, but perhaps you misunderstand me. I' m talking to you about no ordinary show. It's a very high-class show with a very high-class audience... and I am sure you will also enjoy doing it. Why don't you try it once? I' m a dancer. But I am afraid of dancing on stage in front of an audience. - Why are you afraid? - I don't think I can do it. Excuse me, I' m sorry, but you see,... I' m really in difficulty. The thing is that my lead dancer has fractured her foot... and I've already taken all the money for the show. Now if the show does not go on, not only will I suffer monetarily... but my reputation will take a big blow. Please just once come to the rehearsal hall... and if you don't want to, you don't have to do the show. But please, just once... please come to the rehearsal. You' ll have to take someone else. You don't know that I' m a very stubborn man. - What are you up to?! - I' ll not go until you agree. Please come just once to a rehearsal. Everyone's looking at us. - Promise you' ll come? - I' ll come. Promise. - What time? - At two O'clock. - Can you come at one? - Okay, I' ll come at one. You know that we are neighbors, don't you? You know that we are neighbors, don't you? Ma'am! You' ll come, won't you Ma'am? Yes? For you. He's mad! Rahul, you said that girl would come at one o'clock... It's four now. I don't think she' ll come. So what should I do? So if she doesn't come. won't we do our play? - I was only... - Go and get on with your own thing. Ballu, put the spotlight on the entrance. You must have heard of me? No, Pooja, no! You are not dancing with abandon. You are concentrating more on the steps and music. I don't want to see how well you dance. I have already seen that and you are very good. I want to see whether you are Maya or not. I want to see the extent of Maya's love and abandonment. I want to see what happens when Maya dances wholeheartedly. Why don't you understand what I' m trying to tell you? Forget that anyone's sitting here. Forget that the music is playing. Forget that this is a rehearsal. Just think of Maya. I don't want to see you dance. I want to see your madness! Maya's madness... Never in my life has anyone spoken to me in such a way. I don't know how to talk to girls. I told you before that I can't do it. But you' re doing it really well. It's my fault. - I am going on about this Maya. - I don't understand this Maya. - Never mind... - I don't want to do this. Don't worry if you don't understand. We don't have to do this today. We can do it tomorrow. I don't want to do it tomorrow either. Maya, relax. - My name is Pooja! - Of course, it's Pooja. Pooja, you see, if you don't want to dance, then don't. But please stop crying. It's not a problem if you don't want to do it. You see Pooja, it's my way to yell during rehearsals. I wasn't having a go at you. I was only trying to explain to you about Maya. Pooja, perhaps you didn't understand Maya. Maya is the kind of girl who lives in a dream world. She believes that one day her dream prince will come and carry her away. Her friends have always made fun of her... but that did not shake her belief. And today, she has met the man of her dreams... and she is dancing. There is intense love in her dance and madness and a certain arrogance. As if to say, " I knew he would come and now, see, he has come" My dream man has come Nisha, I can't believe we got such a good girl so quickly. I had decided that if I didn't get the right girl for this role... I was going to cancel the play. I was going to give back the money whatever happens. But I was destined to meet Pooja. Her name is Pooja? No it's Jeetendra. Of course it's Pooja. - Is she beautiful? - Really beautiful. You remember that I was talking about Maya? She's just like her. That innocent face,... those dreamy eyes and that bashfulness. Is she a good dancer? When she dances, you can only keep looking at her. I know that you will go crazy when you see her. - I see. - Yes. But can she act? What are you talking about? If she can't act, then I am there to make her act. If I can get you to act I can get anyone to act. There's no water, no soft drink... and you've called me for food. Wait a minute and I' ll bring some. Is she as good a dancer as me? There's no dancer as good as you. Idiot. Can't even lie properly. - May I say something, Pooja? - What? - When you laugh, you know... - I know that I look good. No, no. When you laugh it starts to rain. With the gait of a horse, with the majesty of an elephant, O King of the Rains, where are you from? I know a girl, when she smiles,... it rains. I know a boy, when he sings, it rains. The clouds have descended... They have blocked our path. Tell us what your intentions are, will you not let us go home? There's rain ahead, a storm behind. Treacherous weather! Where can we go? The sky has lowered,... Everything is paused (at a standstill?) How lovely is this season of shadows! Take it as the sign of the times! In such a weather, say something,... ...do something! Why do you stand silent? The doctor has said clearly that you can't go out of the house. There's no need for you to strain yourself trying to get up. Now settle down quietly. Whom are you phoning the minute you've got here? Oh, yes, he called to say that he's at Soni's house. At Soni's? Oh yes, today's Soni and Jimmy's engagement. Aunty, get my clothes out quickly. I want to go there. Look, I' ll phone the doctor and tell him this girl won't listen to me. I don't understand why people get married. If these two people have decided to spend their whole lives together,... then why does everyone else need to make such a fuss? Why are all these people getting excited? These days it has become fashionable to have seven days of ceremonies... and merriment at weddings. Forget it yaar. Get married, have a quiet ceremony and then go home and sleep. I've even come to hate the word ' marriage'. Excuse me, may I have another? But the one good thing is that in all this fuss... you get lots of goodies to eat. Have you eaten? - Later. - Let's sit. I really love weddings. The different small ceremonies - dancing, singing, and making merry - they' re what I love. I' m going to have all of them at my wedding. Are you getting married? Yes. Why didn't you tell me? When are you going to do it? Actually, nothing's fixed yet. He works outside lndia. When he comes back then, we' ll fix a date... when we've found an auspicious time. That's why I haven't mentioned this to anyone. Rahul, when's your wedding with Nisha? Nisha and me? Have you gone mad? The two of us are just good friends and there's no chance of us... ever getting married and in any case marriage and me, no thank you. Actually, I don't believe at all in these wedding ceremonies. I don't know how a person decides to spend his whole life with another. I fail to understand and I' m certain... There can't be a girl who could spend her whole life with me! You' re mistaken in your thinking. There is such a girl. - Where is she? - Somewhere or the other. What are you talking about? I believe that in the beginning, God made all the relationships. But then HE left it to us to find each other. HE created us all as couples. For every one of there is a soulmate. You just have to wait till you meet her. Do you think this is true? This is the truest thing in my life. That means that you have met your soulmate. Yes. I have met him. This is so confusing... What? The ice cream's good. Have some. No. Nisha! When were you discharged from the hospital? I ran away from hospital. Great! Jimmy and Soni will be delighted to see you. - Where are they? - They must be sitting over there. - Go and meet them. - Rahul is there, isn't he? Rahul's gone to drop Pooja home. - Ballu! - Yes, coming! You go ahead. Pooja, it's that story you told me at Soni's. That some special girl is made for me... I've been thinking about that. There was one thing I didn't understand. What? How will I know who's made for me? You have such faith in this theory that you must know... how I am going to meet this girl also. I mean, will she be wandering about with a board with my name on it? Or, when I see her will there be a clap of thunder and a bolt of lightning? Or will music start to play? What will happen? HE will tell you, HE will give a sign... and your heart will realise who the girl is. I've even reasoned with her... but she doesn't listen. She does what she wants. Rahul, it's good that you came. This girl has worried me. Why? What happened? I told her clearly that she needs to stay at home to rest. But you see, she's packing her bags and getting ready to go somewhere. - Where is she planning to go? - How would I know? I've tried my best to explain. She doesn't listen to me. Well, only you can convince her. Don't worry, she won't go anywhere. I' ll just go and twist her ear. - Best of luck. - Alright. Bye... What are you doing? Have you gone mad or what? The doctor told you to rest, didn't he? By the way, where do you think you are going? - I' m going to London. - Going to London? Well, Mum and Dad keep phoning me, asking me to go to see them. Months have gone by and I think I' ll go to see them. Moreover, I also want to run away from here. Want to run away...? From whom? From myself. What's all this nonsense, Nisha? I've begun to get scared of myself, Rahul. So I want to go, in case I make another mistake... Iike the one yesterday. Nisha, you haven't done anything of the sort. You only danced. Look here... Rahul, now we should stop playing hide and seek with each other. We both know what the problem is. What's the problem? The problem is that I love you and you don't love me. Look here, Nisha... I know that you know how much I love you. That night I wasn't so out of it... that I couldn't hear what my heart was saying. Actually, Rahul, we have become such good friends... that we take each other for granted. So I think that a bit of space will give us time to think. But I am sure that when I' m not here, you' ll remember me often. Then perhaps you will start caring for me. One thing is certain, that an idiot like you... doesn't deserve a girl like me. And I don't why, but I feel that when I come back,... you will be on your knees begging me to get married to you. And who knows at that point... I may not want to marry you. Well, perhaps you haven't seen your face... It's better than yours. Nisha, you' re really nice. I know. But let's go. I want to say bye to everyone before I go to the airport. We haven't been properly introduced. Let's start from the beginning. Hi! I' m Nisha. I' m Pooja. Now that we are friends, will you forgive me for what I did yesterday? Forgive you? For what? Pooja, what I did with you yesterday, wasn't right. Actually, ever since this place was built,... I' m the only one who's danced on this floor. This floor has become my trademark. So when I heard that someone else was dancing in my place... I felt bad. Without seeing you or knowing you, I felt jealous. I shouldn't have felt that way. Had I been in your place, then perhaps I'd have done the same. Moreover, I really enjoyed dancing with you. You were the one dancing. I was doing something else. I am really sorry. It's OK. Come on, Nisha, it's time for your flight. I always told Rahul that there could never be another dancer like me. But now I can't say so. And now I' m sure that no one will be able to perform the role of Maya... better than you. Not even me. All the best bye. See you. Bye.. Who's coming to see me off? I' m Rahul. Perhaps you've heard of me? I' m looking for a special dancer for a special role. When I saw you dancing yesterday, I thought... that you would be ideal for this. So, do you think you want to do it? Ballu, what are you doing? Angle the spotlight properly. Pooja, I think that you aren't dancing freely. I want to see how Maya looks when she's happy. I want to see the extent of Maya's madness and love. How many times have I told you to forget that you are you. Forget that people are sitting here. Forget that there's a rehearsal going on here. Pack up. One thing I don't understand. How I will know which girl was made for me? I mean,... will she be wandering about with a board with my name on it? When I see her, will there be a clap of thunder... and a flash of lightning? Oh dear, what's happening? I don't really know. I only hope this does not turn into a romance Oh dear, what's happening? Nobody really knows. But if this is a romance, then so be it. Take my hand in yours, as long as you are here Let us keep talking, as long as we can Let's sit here looking at each other,... as long as the night remains. What name can I give this season of my heart, Even the dewdrops seem to burn, with the fever of my heart. Why do I feel as if someone has caressed me Please go away for a while, so I can collect my feelings, And quieten the violent beating of my heart. Let's slow down so that we don't move ahead too fast There is something between us, don't deny it. And if something further happens have faith in your feelings, For you should know, your heart is not what it was. I hope your uncle will be asleep so I won't have to hear him sing. - Rahul, I forgot to tell you... - What? - I can't attend rehearsal tomorrow. - Why? - Tomorrow I' m going to Khandala. - Khandala. Why? - My teacher lives there. - Which teacher? My dance teacher. She taught me everything I know. Tomorrow it's her birthday. If I say no, will you not go? I shall go, but if you say yes, I' ll go happily. I' m joking. Go on. I' ll rehearse with someone else tomorrow. Thank you. I've had it. Rahul!? What are you doing here? Actually, I have a friend in Khandala. He's been inviting me for ages but I've never had a chance to go. And since we can't work without you... I thought I' ll meet him and give you a ride also. You've no one with you so I thought it' ll be company for you. What are you staring at? Hurry up! If we go early we' ll beat the traffic. - Why are you smiling? - No reason. Today I' m really missing my friend. Stop here. He won't do anything. I' ll be right back. Sandhya, what are you doing? I' ll give you a good slap... you've been overeating and have become so fat... that you can hardly move. No chocolates or ice creams for you. Arms straight. Why are you laughing? Close your mouth. If anyone gets it wrong then no one will watch TV tonight. Don't come begging me again, Please Tai! Please Tai! Look! Here comes your dear Pooja! Tai, how did you recognise me? There's no need to act smart. I recognise all the girls from the sound of their steps. Happy Birthday to you! What's this? You've brought me another ugly sari. Yes, I chose the ugliest I could get my hands on. Where you are going? The class isn't over yet. Tai, now I' m here... the class is over. You' re spoiling them rotten. They've been well behaved all year... but now you've come they've started misbehaving. Sometimes one should be spoilt. Tai! Wait! That's Rahul... he's come with me. Go on, children... go inside! Why are you so frightened? Happy Birthday! Thanks... What are you up to?! I' m trying to touch your feet. - Do I look that old? - No, but out of respect.. Give me your hand... nice to meet you! Come on, you've caught a cold. Come, let's go in. I' ll just take you in. - I' m frightened of the dogs. - They won't hurt you. Who's he? I don't know but I will have to find out. Pooja, you didn't tell me what Rahul does. Rahul...he directs plays. Nowadays I' m working with him. I see... I think that you don't like Rahul specially. No, I like him very much. Very much? I mean, he's a good friend. You mean you don't love him. Tai, Rahul's just a friend. A dear friend. I see... a dear friend. It's not like you think and in any case I wanted to tell you something. There's no need to tell me. Tai, you've got it wrong. Rahul.. - No...! - Rahul, what's up? Nothing. Why are you standing with the spoon? Come join us. Stupid! - Hey, everybody...! - Hey...! Come on! If it's not love, then what is it? Tai,....honestly! I've known you since you were twelve years old. Your heart may not tell you, but it's telling me clearly... ...that you love this boy very much. Now stop lying to me...okay? Just a dear friend... Big deal! I don't remember when this happened. It's become hard to hide this secret from everyone. If you say so, today I' ll ask God for something. I see, so when is Ajay coming back? Nothing is definite but he could come at any time. I' ll be with you in a minute. - Pooja, give me your hand. - Why? I won't hit you! Give me your hand. What's this? Listen carefully to what I' m going to tell you. Ever since you were a child... you have always considered others before yourself. I have always been overwhelmed by your behavior. But today you have me sad. - But l... - Quiet! Sometimes it's very important to consider ourselves. I see that you are running away from your dreams. You won't let them come true. Don't do this. Not everybody is fortunate to have their dreams come true. Don't do this. True love only happens once. The Elephant God will help you to do what is right. Keep it with you always. I love you, Tai. Stop it! I don't make a habit of crying. - Why are you frightened? - Pardon me? Why are you frightened of being in love? Tell her Love and me? OK, give me your hand. - Pleased to meet you. - Take it! What's this? This is, in a way, my blessing. I' m very mean in this matter. It's not easy for me to give my blessing. But when I saw you I thought that perhaps you need it. This will help you to say what you want to... but are unable to do so. Keep it carefully. Very carefully. Go on, if you can't say it, then I' ll say it... I' ll say it. - Definitely? - Definitely. Mark my words carefully. Bye! Come on, come on! Cheers! To the most beautiful couple! Excuse me, ladies and gentlemen... May I have your attention, please? Since I am Jimmy's best man... I have the right to make a speech and you all have to listen to it. Until today, I didn't understand how two people can take a vow... to spend their entire lives with each other. I didn't believe in these vows of marriage. And seeing Jimmy and Soni together only strengthened my conviction. Because there can't be anyone as innocent as Soni... and there can't be a scamp to beat Jimmy. I used to worry that Soni and Jimmy are too different... to spend their lives together, but today I realise that I was wrong. I am a little ashamed to admit that I have started believing in love. The kind of love in which lips don't speak, eyes do. The kind of love that binds two people together forever. And today, I keep thinking of just one thing. I remember something a very dear friend said: that God predetermined all our emotional relationships... but then HE left it to us to find each other. HE made us all couples and for every one of us somewhere... there is just one soulmate. HE made Soni for Jimmy. Today I thank God for getting Jimmy and Soni together... and I pray that HE may give each one of us the ability... to recognise our own soulmate. Thanks. Rahul, you are strange. Soni and Jimmy have made their farewells and you' re still here. I don't like farewells. OK, but drop me home, will you? My bangle! Rahul, have you seen my bangle? Now I am sure I won't find it. It was my favorite bangle. And mine... Rahul! Come on, give it to me. Come here and take it. What childish behavior! Give it to me! Come closer Here goes... happy? Come closer. - Closer... - Rahul, stop it! Closer... Closer... Closer still... Closer... How long shall we sit in silence? We both want to say something. You say something, I' ll say something, my love. We would rather have died than reveal our secret, oh my love. You were a few steps away from me, I was a few steps away from you, Yet we may as well have been hundreds of miles apart. Step by step our wavering hearts came together, my love. Come, you have won me over and I am defeated by my heart, Today with great difficulty my lips say `love'. Now I' m madly in love, don't ever leave me, my love. Arrange all the furniture properly. Where is Pooja? Rahul, the set is ready. Good, well done. Call Pooja. OK. Shruti Call Pooja. Pooja, we' re ready. - Are you angry with me? - Not at all. Then why aren't you speaking to me? I am speaking to you. For three days I haven't seen your face or heard your voice. I was very busy. I have been calling you everyday. Why haven't you been answering? The phone has been out of order for some time. What is the problem? Tell me. I want to know the cause of your restlessness. There's no problem. There is a big problem. The fact is that we both love each other very much. We can't tell each other about it. Today I've come here to tell you that I love you. I love you very much and I know that you also love me. So then, say it once and that will be the end of your restlessness. Everything will be alright. I don't love you. - You' re lying. - I' m not lying. Look into my eyes and tell me that we weren't made for each other. We weren't. Tell me that when I go away from you, that you don't turn to look at me. I don't. Tell me, when I touch you nothing happens to you. Nothing. Tell me that you don't want to come into my arms right now. I don't. Look into my eyes just once and tell me that you don't love me. I don't... I don't... I don't! Nisha! Nisha! You look great! How are you? But I am sure that when I' m not here you' ll remember me often... and when I get back, you will be on your knees begging me... to marry you. And then perhaps I may not want to. Well, I' ll be off. I' m a little tired. I' ll see you all tomorrow. Bye! What's up with Nisha? She's tired. She' ll come tomorrow. Don't get unnecessarily worried. I' m not a nice girl, Rahul, I' m bad. I' m really bad. No Nisha, you are my friend and no friend of mine is bad. No, Rahul, you don't know that I am not a nice girl. Now you see, I love a boy and have always loved him... and today I realised that he doesn't love me. He loves someone else. I feel hurt. I feel jealous. Rahul, I shouldn't feel like this. I am very bad. No, Nisha... No, Rahul. Actually, that boy isn't just the one I love... but he's also my best friend. Today, for the first time, I saw love in his eyes. I couldn't put love there in all these years,... but that other girl has. Perhaps they are made for each other. Perhaps I was never meant for him. Perhaps her love for him is true. But I' m not happy, Rahul. So you see, I should be happy for my friend. But I' m not happy... I' m very bad. Nisha, you are not bad, you are really nice. You know who is bad? HE is bad... THE ONE who plays around with us humans. making A love B, while B loves C... and C loves D.... I don't know why HE does this. When HE makes one person love another... then HE ought to make sure that the other one also loves her in return. But that's not what HE does. HE's really bad. You' re not bad. HE's bad. You' re right... It's HE who's bad. HE's bad! YOU are bad. I am not. YOU are bad. I haven't done anything wrong. YOU are the one. YOU are bad. YOU are bad. I' m sorry, Nisha. Please don't cry. Don't say sorry, Rahul. I won't be able to stop myself from crying. Don't say sorry. Just don't say sorry. Ajay, when I was a little girl, you used to tease me about my dreams. When I used to tell you that I am looking for the one meant for me... you would say that I am mad and silly. You would smile and say that when I grow up... my dreams will vanish. But you know, I have grown up and my dreams have not vanished. They have grown with me. That day, at the airport, when you suddenly asked me to marry you... at first I didn't realise what I should do. But then I thought, you were my dearest friend... and the one who knew me the most. Who could be better for me. And I remained standing there. You left and I made you a part of my dreams. I started believing that you were the one made for me. And then... and then I met Rahul. What are you saying? But Pooja hasn't said anything to me about it. I had forbidden her from telling you. I wanted to tell you myself. I can hardly believe you! I am so happy! When are you coming? I called just to tell you this. I' m coming tomorrow. Tomorrow.... What can I tell you about Rahul? Where do I start? Well, you should realise that I've never met anyone like him. Sometimes he's an angel, sometimes a devil. Sometimes crazy... and sometimes a genius. Sometimes he scolds so harshly... and sometimes he makes funny faces to make me laugh. Sometimes he is more stubborn than a child and then... sometimes a beloved companion. In three days. Oh no, I want time to get things ready for a big wedding. Ma, I don't have any free time. The company is sending me to Japan for a year. You' ll have to wait for eight to ten months. I can't wait that long. OK, you come here and I' ll start the preparations. The dreams of your crazy girl have come true, Ajay. She has found the partner of her dreams... and she wants your permission to make all her dreams come true. Ajay phoned just now. He's told me everything. He's coming tomorrow, Pooja, ...and he says to get the wedding organised as quickly as possible. You would tell me your smallest secrets... and you hid such a big one from me? Come here, sit by my side. You know, Pooja, ever since you came to this house,... I've had a dream in which, one day, you would become my daughter-in-law And I your mother. would feel about each other... when you grew up. Whether you would be friends and care about each other or not. I also wanted that you should decide if at all because you wanted it,... not for my sake. You don't know how happy I am, for I know... that there cannot be better girl than you for my son. Now I shall hold this marriage with such celebrations that... the whole town will stare. You don't know how happy I am. May you live long. I want full lights and I want to see M6 on both left and right of stage. Supandi, in a while I want to hear the music tracks. Yes Soni, the elevation should be three feet higher... or else the audience on stage right will not know what is going on. When Ballu lights M6, one spot light will filter here on this side... and the audience will get a glimpse of the entry before it happens. Hi Pooja. I have to talk to you. The show opens in two days, we' ll talk later. Show me all the costumes of act three. Go do some work. Rahul, I have to talk to you. Pooja, just a minute. Okay... tell me what's the problem? Rahul, please try and understand what I am about to tell you. Rahul, Nisha is calling you. The stadium has called. I forgot to talk to her. I' ll be right back. Rahul please be serious... Ajay?! My name is Ajay, but if you like you can call me Rahul. I really missed you, Pooja. Remember I told you that I'd come to get you? Here I am. I came here after meeting mom. She is so happy. Hey, I hope you haven't changed your mind? You' re going to marry me, aren't you? Have you told your friends? - I was going to... - I' ll tell them. Ladies and gentlemen... I' m sorry for the intrusion. You don't know my name: it's Ajay. I am Pooja's childhood friend and I am going to marry her. In three days we are getting married and you all must come. Pooja, you' re weird. Why didn't you tell us before? We had begun to feel that you were our Maya. We forgot you' re Pooja and you have your own private life... ...and your own relationships and even prior commitments. We are really stupid! Pooja, Congratulations. - Thanks. - And this is... This is Rahul, our director. Rahul, my brother, She likes only the name. - Rahul, I have a request. - Go on. May I take her away for an hour? You are taking her away forever from us. That will be in a ceremonious way. This is just a lunch date with Pooja. Do I have your permission? My permission! Now I' ll have to get your permission to meet Pooja. Actually, now that you've come Pooja won't be happy here, will you Pooja? So go on. I' ll get by without you. You can go. We have his permission... Iet's go. OK. Bye. Ballu, show me the final mix. Shruti, show me the sketches. And Nisha, call up the auditorium and tell them the sketches... will be with them by the evening. In two days we are going on stage... Lights! why aren't you showing me the lights. There are just two days... and you' re taking it easy! Come on, the lights. Shruti, the sketches, Shruti, here first. This is our last meeting. I' m getting married tomorrow. I don't want to meet you ever again after today. Just think that I was never a part of your life. As soon as I start to move, track me with the spotlight... and the other will stay on Pooja. When I get right up to the audience, then slowly dim the light. The show will be over... The End. Does anyone have a question? I don't want any mistakes, OK? - Rajesh...Jimmy...alright? - Yeah. OK. Tomorrow be at the stadium on time. - Rahul... - Yes? - Something is bothering me. - What? I don't like the end of your story. Why? This ending's too sad. A love story should always have a happy ending. The audience should come out smiling. People like to live in a dream world. They have seen many dreams, now let them see a little reality. Every love story is like this in real life. Full of sorrow and pain. No, Nisha, this ending is absolutely right. There can't be another end to this love story. Jimmy, just go and check the next entry stage left. The heart is crazy. Just refuses to listen. Look, Pooja's last entry is after this. Get her ready and bring her here. Don't worry. Nisha's getting her. Don't make this mistake, Pooja. Very few people are lucky enough to love and to be loved. You can't break the tie, which He has ordained. You can't break it. I've spent my years giving love the name of friendship,... now you are going to spend the rest of your life... giving friendship the name of love. This is a betrayal! A betrayal of love... a betrayal of friendship. Don't do such a thing! This is our last meeting. I' m getting married tomorrow. I don't want to meet you ever again after today. Just think that I was never a part of your life. I want to ask you something before you go. Did you ever love me even for a single day or a single moment? This line is not in the play. Tell me just once... Have you ever really loved me? Even for a moment? What the hell is Rahul saying?! I shan't go away until I get an answer to my question. Did you ever love me, even for a single moment? No. I didn't hear what you said. - No. - Speak up, I couldn't hear. - No. - Louder, louder.. No, I have never loved you. Not for a day, not for a moment. Never. That is all l wanted to hear it. I' m Rahul,...you will remember my name, won't you? What can I tell you about Rahul. I have never met anyone like him. Sometimes he's mad; sometimes he's a genius. Sometimes he scolds very harshly and sometimes he makes faces... and makes me laugh. Sometimes he is more stubborn than a child is... and sometimes he is a beloved companion. What he is or is not, I cannot really express in words... ...but I don't know why... When he looks at me, I feel beautiful,... when he laughs I feel like dancing. When he is upset I feel like holding him in my arms. When he loves me my eyes fill with tears. He has made me realise that I am made for him...and he for me. I love him very much, not for one day or one moment... but for my whole life. I love you, Rahul. I love you. Now that I've seen them, I believe that someone, somewhere... was made for me as well. - lsn't that true? - Yes. My name is Ajay. Yours? I' m Nisha. - Nisha, are you married? - What?
