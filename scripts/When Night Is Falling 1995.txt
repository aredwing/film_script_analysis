And our hunger for the certainty of this law, for a spiritual anchor, for an immutable, eternal truth is proof... of it's existence. Especially now, after a few decades of relativistic situational ethics, our society is tired of constant change. And as we approach the millennium... -Transformations are a basic staple of mythology. Transformations from human form to animal forms and vice-versa; of gods into humans and humans into gods; of wind into blood, flesh into water, ugliness into beauty. The human need for change, progress, movement, is reflected in the ancient stories, which are told over and over again in different forms. [ bell ringing ] Okay, uh, Chapter 12 for Thursday. Thanks. -Professor Baker. l was wondering if you could help me with something. -Of course, Professor Bergin. What with? -Uh, well, I have to prepare a speech on very short notice. -What speech? -Well, it's just the keynote address to the lnternational Theologians' Conference in Chicago. -Professor Bergin... That's wonderful! -Yeah, it is! So... Let's do something exciting tonight, huh? -Yeah, something really crazy. -Okay... -Hey, remember, Martin, Calvinists are not supposed to have sex standing up. -I know. 'Cause it might lead to dancing. -Camille. Martin. -Reverend. -If you have time, I'd like to meet with you later today. Four o'clock in my office? -Sure, Reverend. -And don't book anything immediately after. I'd like for us not to be disturbed. -Hugh really is brilliant, you know, Bob? Bob? Bob? Ah no... Oh no! Bob, come! Bob? We went over this, remember? "Come" means "come here". Oh, Tillie. -I'm 47. -Yeah, that's great. But have you seen my dog? -Ah yes, he walked by here about half an hour ago. I remember because it was the first time I'd seen him without you. He was charging along like he had an appointment or something. Thatta way. -Thank you. -Don't you love it the way dogs sometimes get this look like they got a hectic schedule to follow? Busy, busy! -Bob... -Are you all right? -My dog just died. -Oh. I'm sorry. -I loved him so much. It's pathetic, really. -No. No, it's not pathetic. It's, uh... Animals love you in a way people can't. So uncomplicated, really, you know? Whether you're successful or not, or ugly or beautiful... they don't care. -Yeah. Thanks. -Oh... It's okay, it's okay. How did he die? -I don't know. I don't get it. He... he wasn't that old... He just snuck away and... I found him in an alley. And you know what? I realized that... I loved him more than anything, anyone, I'm suppose to love. Oh, dear... What a blubbering idiot! Il think everything good just goes, eventually. -Yeah. [ washing machine beeping ] Oh, they're done. I'll get yours. Yeah. -Thanks. -Yeah. Just relax. You know, I really didn't expect to be this long. l gotta run. -Oh. l'm sorry. -Uh... sorry about your dog. -It's okay. Thanks. [ door opening ] -Hello! -Hi! -Hi. -Hi. Hi. -Ah... Where'd you get that? -Do you like it? -Yeah. It's... It's wild. Where'd you get it? -Oh, just picked it up. I think it has a certain... reckless charm, don't you? -Yeah... Yeah... It's fun. -Yeah. -Okay, we should get going, honey. -Yes. -Uh... -What? -We are going to a meeting with the reverend, remember? -Yes. -Very funny. -What? -Camille, you can't wear that. He's gonna think you've lost your mind. -So? -And I've lost mine. -Martin, this is the era of the individual, remember? You've got to stop worrying about other people's opinion of you. Okay? Let's go. -But if I do take their offer, we'll need someone else to fill the role of chaplain. An appropriate successor would concern me... greatly. -Well, chaplain certainly is a very exciting position, especially in these times. I'm sure you'll have lots of takers. -It's not takers we need, it's givers. -It was just a manner of speaking. -And of course, whoever took the position would have to be beyond reproach, for the more conservative element of our college constituancy. We have to remember that not long ago, we were still debating whether or not Christians could use rock 'n' roll to convey a godly message. -Remember when old Mrs. Lindow said that... all rock 'n' roll led to sexual intercourse, because the music... no, it was the rhythm of the music matched the rhythm of the contractions of an orgasm. -lt's easy to laugh, but we have to remember that Mrs. Lindow is as much a member of God's flock as anyone else. -Yeah. -All I'm trying to say is that... the chaplainship of the college could well go to a man and woman, together. And as one of our star theologians, Martin, you're more than qualified. And Camille, your book on Christian ethics, your student counselling last year and your general behaviour as a fine Christian woman make you a credit to the college and to the faith. But... if we were to hire a man-and-woman team, they could not be suspected to be... to be indulging in the physical pleasures of marriage without actually being married... even if their sexual relations were very much in the closet, as it were. -Well, we're both... very committed to each other. Well, you want to skip the restaurant, then? -Well, in fact, I should get some grading done. -Yeah. I don't really know what I'm going to speak about yet anyway. -No? -You sure you're going to be okay about Bob? -Sure. -Okay. Bye, then. -Bye. -Easy, easy. What is this?! [ background chatter] -Excuse me. [ a woman ]: Okay, next! -I'm sorry, I'm looking for, uh... -What do you do? -Uh, I teach mythology. -That's new. And? -And I'm just looking for someone. -And what happens? -This is funny. I'm not an acting person. I have her laundry, you see? Petra Soft? -Oh, I see, you have her laundry. Uh... she's right over there. -Thanks. -Timothy? Are you gonna look at these? We don't wanna have to call them back. -Honey, I'll be with you when I'm free. Right now, however, I am... occupied. -Right. You're occupied... Okay, next! -Okay, Tim, can we bring in a third one? -Unfortunately, I only have two hands available, you know? -Does that mean "no"? -Uh-huh. -Excuse me... Can I talk to you for a moment? -Oh, yeah. Uh... Tim, could we call it a night? -Uh, Petra, before we call it a night, I have an idea I'd like to try, and my idea is... Uh... Okay, it's a night. It's a night, go. -Hello. -Hi. -Uh... A funny thing happened. l don't know if you've checked your laundry yet, but I think we did a switcheroo by mistake. -A switcheroo, yeah. I did realize that. How are you? Are you feeling better? -Oh, yeah, yeah. Much better. I... I wanted to thank you... [ all ]: Ah... [ Timothy ]: Shit! [ Tory ]: Timothy! [ Timothy ]: Marcus! [ Tory ]: Don't panic, everyone. Perhaps the electricity is a little too much to ask for... [ Timothy ]: Why do I have to do everything myself?! -Come back to my trailer. I've got your stuff there. -Don't worry, honey, I'm getting it fixed. -''Don't worry, honey''... That's what you said just before the tent went up in flames! -One small fire and I'm responsible every time some little problem... Just keep your hair on your head! -Thanks, I will. -So my name's Petra, by the way. -Yeah, I saw that on your card. And mine is Camille Bak... Camille. -Camille. That's nice. I like it. It's like 'come here'. It's nice. [ loud growling ] -Hey, Petra! -Shut up, Jim. So your accent, is that from Quebec? -Yeah, originally from Quebec. But my father was a minister, so I moved around a lot. -Well, this is my house. -Oh, well... This is really... nifty. -Yeah, I like it. I wanna do that wall in some kind of fun-fur and slate or something, but slate's really expensive. -Yeah. Well... here's your laundry. -Oh, right. So, uh, can you join me for a scotch? -Oh, l'm not much of a drinker, really. -And some music. 'Cause without music, life would be a mistake. -So, I have a confession to make. I wore one of your tops. You know, the one with the zipper? -Really? -A school teacher at a Christian college has to get her kicks somehow. It did make me feel a little... racy, for a while. -I'm sure it looked great on you. Your man must've liked it. -What man? -Oh... I just thought, you know, someone as beautiful as you are would, uh... -Oh, well... -You have an exquisite mouth, you know. -I do? -I have a confession to make too, actually. I did the, uh, switcheroo on purpose. -Why? -I wanted to see you again. -Why? -I don't know. You moved me. -Because I was so pathetic, I suppose? -No. No, I can't explain. Um... I'm sorry if that's embarrassing. -No. No, I mean, I... I think you were... really... very tender, at the Laundromat. You touched me. -I wanted to. Camille, I'd love to see you in the moonlight with your head thrown back and your body on fire. -Okay. That was uncalled for. -True. But if you wait for what's called for, usually nothing happens, so... -Well, I am clearly a bit out of my element here. Can I have my... my laundry? -No. No, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Sit down. I was just... -I must be fun to shock or something. -It's true, you are, but I... -Well, I'm nobody's fool. -No. No, no, no. Of course you're not. I'm the fool. I'm sorry. I... -Can I have my laundry? -So you're a school teacher, huh? -My laundry. Please. Thank you. [ Tory ]: lf the foundation money comes through, we might be all right. We might be able to squeeze by. But what do you mean, good authority? Did you talk to the foundation yourself? 'Cause if the money doesn't come through this time, I don't-- Timothy... -That is the problem here. -I swear to God, I've just about had it. If I'd known it was gonna be like this, I would've-- -What? What, gone back to your racoon act? -Don't start that. It was a good idea. -Yeah, racoons. -How was I suppose to know they were so selfish? -You know, I think maybe it's this fuse here. -How did you find me? -There aren't 20 Christian colleges with someone named Camille teaching here. Listen, I wanted to, uh... apologize for being so aggressive last night. l don't know anyone here, and I just... -Come. -Let's go. You look great. -Thanks. [ laughing ] -That's good! Most impressive! So, we've covered abortion, church and state, predestination, drug abuse, prostitution... Ah yes, homosexuality. How do approach the homosexuality problem, Camille? -Well, uh... I'm not really sure I'd consider it a problem. -Honey, what you said at Tom's. Camille said that it's important to love the sinner but hate the sin, so that, uh... you're allowed to feel the desire but not act on that desire. -Well, in heteros... in retrospect, sorry, I've come to think that there's a lot of room for multiplicity in God's creation. -You are aware that that is contrary to doctrine in this matter? -God... God cannot be so cruel as to decree that people like... like that... can never, ever be contented. I mean, one's devotions are not entirely chosen. -But the Bible. I mean, there isn't one condoning passage in the entire Bible. Not to mention that every other holy book of every major religion opposes homosexuality. -I know, yes. -As a chaplain, how would you counsel a young Christian who came to you and said that he was struggling with his desires for another man? -Well, I... I would try to determine whether sh... he is reacting out of, uh... Uh, it's a very controversial issue, as you well know, and I don't claim to have it all worked out. I don't know. -But you do acknowledge that this institution and the book upon which this institution is based characterize homosexual acts as unnatural and sinful. And as chaplain, you'd have to support this doctrine. -Of course. -Camille? -Yes. -Are you okay? -Yeah. Yes, l'm fine. -The reverend wants to see you in his office. -I don't really want to talk to him right now. It's just... -I know what's going on, you know. -You do? -It's okay. I understand... I think. -You do? -Camille, you've been saying the same thing about a million different ways. The buying of the top, talking about orgasms in front of a reverend, and now this almost-sabotage of the interview... -What am I saying? -That this pressure for us to get married just forthe sake of a job feels like a sham. You don't want to be this career Christian who just does what she's told. And you know what? -What? -Maybe it's a blessing in disguise. We've been together for almost three years. Maybe we're just being cowards. -You think so? -Yes. I love you, Camille Baker. Oh, I love you more than anything. Any job, anything. And maybe you can... imagine more intoxicating options... but it's okay. It's what imaginations are for. -Oh, Martin... -Let's not wait any longer. Just marry me, whether we take this job or not, okay? I-I still have to think, Martin. I... -All right, take five everyone! -I'll be back in a second. -What were you doing at the school? Are you stalking me or something? -I'm sorry if I threw you by showing up. I mean, to interrupt you and your man. -That's what I came to talk to you about. Petra, uh... What happened this morning... was an aberration. -Of course. -So, don't think that I'm a... -Oh, I won't, I won't. -I'm sorry I lied. I think I was just flattered by your attention but I'm not... I'm not really like that. -Okay. Well... it was nice meeting you. -Well, I mean, we could, you know... -What? We could... could what? -Well, don't people like you just have friends, sometimes? -Yes, people like me do. -And... why couldn't I be one? -I'm attracted to you, Camille. -It's okay, but... It's okay. We're not animals. We don't always have to act on our attractions. I mean... -What would we do... as friends? -Have fun. -Fun. Sounds like a buddy movie. -Yes, exactly. Like Thelma and Louise. But without the guns. -Oh, well, no guns... I don't know, I don't know. -Well... I don't have any classes this afternoon. -Oh. I had something planned. Uh... I suppose you could tag along. -What? -Will you accept to be surprised? -Hey, Petra! -Yeah. -You must be kidding. -Huh-huh. You'll love it. You'll love it, Camille! It's fucking mind-blowing, I promise you. I've done it like three million times. You have to try it. -Can I see your rating, please? -Oh, yeah. Here. -Okay. I'll need a number, in case there's a problem. -What kind of problem? -Don't worry, it's just a formality. -Thanks. -You have to try it, Camille. How will you know if you don't try it? -Well, I haven't tried shooting myself in the head either... Just one question, Petra... Why? -Why? -Why? -Why? Because... Because fear is what you pay for adventure, Camille. -Petra... If you wanna do this, like, the wind is perfect right now. But night's falling, you better hurry. -Exactly. You hear him? -What? You think I should kill myself because it's getting dark? -Don't be such a wuss. -Okay. Okay, Petra, this is all very poetic and everything but... no, really, I'll watch. -Woooo-hoo-hoo-hoo! You have to ride with the wind, not against. Do you feel it? -l feel it and I hate it! -Look at that! -Oh, dear... -Sorry. Whoa! Hang on. Shit! Camille, you're really throwing me off. Wake up, Camille! Wake up! Oh, gosh... Oh, God, are you okay? -Oh... -What? -I hit my knee on something. -What, your knee, is it fucked? -I don't know. -Oh, shit! Where's the guy? We should get you to a hospital, okay? -No, no, no, it's okay. -Oh, I shouldn't have pushed you to do it. I'm such a fucking steamroller sometimes. I haven't done it that many times. I'm so... I'm sorry. -lt's okay. lt's okay. lt's okay. But I did it, didn't l? [ They laugh. ] How does it feel? -It hurts. -It helps to swear. -It hurts like a fuck. -You know, you probably strained some other muscles. Here, roll over. Good. -Hmm, it's very, uh... healing. -So, what do you teach? -Mythology. -What, like Zeus and Cupid and stuff? -And stuff, yes. They're beautiful stories. -So tell me a story. -Cupid, for instance, was a god who fell in love with a beautiful mortal, Psyche. Now, this was a big taboo, you see, because, uh... gods and mortals were not allowed to mix. So, uh, Cupid stole her away to a secret palace... -Where they made fabulous love. -Mm-hm. But Cupid wouldn't let Psyche see him. They only made love in the dark. Until, uh... until... This makes me nervous. -Me too. I think it's supposed to. So then what happens? -Then, uh... [ doorbell ringing ] Shit! God... Sorry. -The boyfriend. [ Camille ]: Hello? -Hello. Camille, it's Reverend DeBoer. Can I come up? -Uh... Okay... Oh, you-you're gonna have to, uh... -I am not gonna climb out the window. What's the problem? We're just buddies, right? You haven't done anything wrong. -Sorry, Reverend. Please, come up. Okay, uh... Sorry. I met you at the Laundromat and we just switched laundry. You know? -Yeah, yeah, yeah. -Coming! Oh... Hi, Reverend. -Good evening. -Come in. This is Petra. Um, l met her at the Laundromat, quite... randomly, and we switched laundry by mistake. Just one of those things, you know? And she just came back to return mine. And this is Reverend DeBoer, the chaplain at the college... where l teach. -Enchanted. -How do you do? -Um... Well, Petra, thank you for returning my clothes and, uh... it was nice meeting you. -Well, I hope that you can make some time for me in the future? -Yes, uh... Reverend? Reverend... Reverend, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. She's just a street kid, quite disturbed, really. And I can't seem to get herto leave. I flattered myself to think that I could teach her something. -Well, you do what you have to, Camille, but we have to talk. -Sure. I'll come around tomorrow. Petra? I love you. Why don't you just tell them you're sick? -I'm not, and l gave them my word. -I like this new, uh... you, though. See you Monday. -Goodbye. [ knocking ] -Ahem! Ahem... Petra, uh... I think I should tell you we may have to leave here very soon. -Why? -Well, unfortunately, I think they are going to call in the loan, and then they will want to take the trucks and the equipment and before I let that happen, I will make very sure that we, uh, run away. Maybe very soon. I don't know. Petra... you're not thinking of jumping ship, are you? Because, uh... Well, because, uh... -No, No. Of course not. -Are you very serious about this girl? -Oh, I don't know. I think she might, you know, just be experimenting. I don't know. You know, all good things go eventually. -Yes, but, uh... but for you, Petra, what does it mean for you? Oh... Come here. It's okay. -You knew we didn't get it. Why didn't you tell me? I've been counting on that stupid grant. -I didn't want you to worry. -All this change, change, change! I'm not cut out for it! A little house in the suburbs is sounding pretty good, right? -Is that a fact? -You know, Timothy, sometimes I have this dream of just... picking up and running away from this circus. -Oh, grow up, Tory. -I couldn't help it. It's like something that is... stronger than I am and... I... -It helps to put names to our feelings. Naming things gives us power over them. -Yeah. Maybe it gives others power over me, too. -You have nothing to fear from me, Camille. -It's not that I've been unhappy with Martin. It's just that I'm... I'm happier with... Oh, God... Why did I get into this? Why? -Our community has been remiss for many years. It takes long to change. But yes, I think we have been guilty of homophobic cruelty and excluded people like you in the past. -People like me. -But what I'd really like to do right now... is to pray. -I'm not here to pray. -You do still believe? Please. Camille! [ loud music playing ] -What's going on? -We have been invited to a circumstance. -Circumstance? -Circumstance is a festival for the Modern Circus in San Francisco and it is very prestigious. And it is all expenses paid. And to me, this is... okay. Yeah? -Hi! -We have to talk. -Camille, we have to dance! -No, Petra, I'm not much of a dancer. Really, I... -Oh! Oh, I can fix that. You're so lovely it breaks my heart. [ a man ]: Hey, Petra! Who's your lovely new assistant? [ Petra laughs. ] -Why don't you show us your tits, Sweet-pea. -Petra... Petra, stop! -What? [ a man ]: Oh, dear, trouble in paradise. -Camille, I'm sorry. -That was vulgar! -It was not, Camille. It was just fun. -It was tasteless and... and crass! -Yeah, well... you're... Are you ashamed of me? What, I'm your dirty little secret? -Petra... I just don't like being laughed at. -Oh, really. Well, aren't you cute! Hey! Good luck, then, sweetheart, 'cause these are some of the kindest people in the world, Camille. I1:08:56,332 -- 01:08:59,199 lf you can't handle a little fun here, what are you gonna do when the really mean fuckers of the world start making fun of you? Huh? Cause they will, you know. They'll use it against you and they'll be laughing up a storm, Camille. -Not if you show a little dignity. -Dignity? Wha... What could be more dignified than dancing with the person I adore? [ Martin ]: Camille, it's me. I'm at the island airport, I'm back in town. I got them to switch around my second lecture so I could get back sooner. Huh... You must be out walking Bob. Anyway. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Huh... I'm gonna come over to your place right now and... I've missed you, sweetheart. I'll be right over. Hello! -I love your sex. I love your wisdom and the... way you say ''switcheroo''. I love that sadness that you get in your eyes sometimes. And other stuff. -But? -But... we might be leaving tomorrow and I can't stay and you can't leave. [ answering machine ]: Your mailbox has no new messages. If you would like to change your-- -Why are you so defeatist? -'Cause I've loved before, see? And lost. -I know what my obligations are... [ people arguing ] -Pardon me. Makes sense to anyone here? -She's over there, in the black trailer. -Okay, thank you. -Listen... I love to look at you. I love to talk to you. I love your openness, I love what you do, I love... I love you. -Everything gets ordinary eventually. -Ordinary with you would be... wild. -What would you do in a circus? -Well, I have a few ideas. -I smoke pot. -I drink. Cherry brandy. -I don't know. Make your own decisions. -But do you want me? -Something awful! -What's your name? -Petra. -l'm Martin. -Excuse-me. Would you like a drink of cider? -No. Thanks. -Can I do anything? -No. But thank you. -She answers a kind of... wordless question in me. Yeah, that's good, that's good. A wordless question. A wordless question. I can explain. I... No, in fact, I can't. -It's okay. I know he meant a lot to you. -Huh... yeah. Well... Don't bother telling me it's neurotic. -It's probably hard to talk about without feeling... foolish? -Well... it is foolish. I... I distracted myself. -I could've been a little more receptive. I mean, the pressure of the promotion, my proposal... It probably shook you to your foundations. Hum? -Well... -You probably hardly recognized yourself. -I... Martin, I... I wanted to talk to you about something. -I'll help you bury him. -Thank you. I have something to say-- -Are you not gonna ask me about my trip? -I'm trying to say something-- -It was wonderful. They're gonna publish my speeches in the bi-annual review. -That's great. -And there was a... a beautiful talk by... by some guy from Sweden, just at the end, about silence. And he said this contemporary obsession to voice everything sometimes does more damage than good, and that the only real dialogue is with God. And it felt... true. -But... I rememberyou saying that when you hide one thing, you hide many. -He was saying that sometimes, it's selfish to give yourself the relief of saying something when the consequences far outweigh the relief. See? Anyway, I'll help you take care of Bob. -You said that. Martin, listen... -No. No, you listen. This is what I know. I love you. For we have something, you and me, don't we? -Of course we do. Yes. -I can understand everything. I mean, I'm not such a bad deal. -No, you're not a bad deal. -These things pass. -What things? -These... passing things. Just think, please. Please, just think before you speak. Okay? You are what you say you are, Camille. Just be careful when you say it. -I'm sorry. [ Petra ]: Camille, it's me. I hope you're okay. Listen, we're leaving tonight. I thought maybe you wanted to... Oh God, I don't know what I thought. Just call me. Please. -Coffee? -We're off, gentlemen. -...I said, ''Why don't you prove it, scumbag? Give me one good reason why I should believe your bullshit.'' And he had nothing to say. The guy dropped right down to his knees. -Oh, shit! Hang on, I dropped the hang strap. Oh, shit... Hey, guys? Come here! -What? -Come here! There's a body. -Oh, Jesus! Hey... This is the woman that was gliding with Petra the other day. -I can't tell if she's breathing. -We should call an ambulance. -I'll get to a phone. -I'll go back and get the stuff from the truck. -Yeah. [ phone ringing ] -Hello?... Well... Where? [ tires screeching ] [ siren wailing ] Where is she? -She's in here. -What happened? -I don't know. We just found her. I think she was drunk. -How is she? -She... hypothermia. I don't know. -Well, can't we get her into town? -The ambulance is supposed to get here any minute. -Can we at least put her in your truck or something? -No. They said, "Don't move her. Just keep her warm." -The best thing to do for a hypothermia victim... [ The voice becomes an echo. ] [ whispering ]: Please, please, fate... God, Zeus... Science... Anybody... Okay... I promise to love her and I promise to cherish her... And to follow her and to lead her anywhere... -Yes... -Oh! "Hallelujah" "Hallelujah" "Hallelujah" "Hallelujah" "Hallelujah" "Hallelujah" "Hallelujah" "Hallelujah"
