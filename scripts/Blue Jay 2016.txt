Boom! Insta... insta Mom. And his ex-wife was really wonderful to me. Their whole childhood we had a week with them and a week off. And so, you know, one week, it's just the two of us. We can do whatever we want whenever we want to and footloose and fancy free and then next week it's little league and soccer games and then studying for their SAT's and college tours and you know... Yep. What? It's crazy. It's crazy. Yeah. It's just crazy. It's great. Jim. What? [Jim laughing] It's crazy. It's just crazy. Would you stop it? I am not doing anything.

No, that's not possible. [Amanda] I think it's him. [Jim] No that's his grandson. He was like a hundred in high school. That's his hat, -I'm telling you that's his hat. -Oh, my God! [Jim] Wayne travels with Wayney man. What? Do you think he would remember? I'm not sure he's alive. I haven't seen him move yet. [laughs] No he's not going to remember. That was our dorky thing that we did. That was... You want to put a wager on it? I'll bet you $100, he doesn't remember. A $100? I'll bet you a $100. [door squeaking] -Hi Wayney. -Hi Wayney. Hey.

Congratulations again. -Nice to see you. -Yeah. Yeah, good to see you guys. Looking good. You look exactly the same. Get out of here. Come on now. You're gonna make me cry. [indistinct chattering] Is the coat warm enough for you? Okay, yeah. Yeah that's the one... [indistinct chattering] It served pizza long time ago. [water lapping] [Amanda] Yeah but I remember being like... Did they move them? [Jim] That it. No, that's it. See, 'cause I use to put my leg -Oh yeah. -right here. Watch. -Wait. -Here we go. [Amanda] Hold on. Let's see. [Jim] Come on. Hold this. [Amanda] I still got the stuff. [chuckles] So, what's next for you? You're going back to Tucson or... you're working? You got a house, you're gonna build? I don't know, Tucson is... and work stuff's kinda up in the air. -What does that mean? -So... Do you not like doing it? No it's good, it's... I don't know. I have to admit there's a small part of me as I was sitting... in the old house and thinking about fixing it up. And I'm starting to think like... I don't know maybe... I could stay here. It looks interesting to me. What would you do here though? It's just a thought, I don't... -I mean, I've no plan. -I know, I like... Don't you want... Why you grilling me right now? I'm not trying to grill you, I just... I guess I'm a little worried about you? Why are you worried about me? I don't know, you don't... you seem... I don't know a little, lost or... I haven't got it all, figured out. But... you know... Isn't there anything you want to do? Amanda, I don't fucking know what I'm doing, okay? I had lost my job, okay? I lost my job. I had a falling out with my uncle who was stealing clients from me and I beat the fuck out of him, okay? I beat the living shit out of him. It was a really scary moment and I had a crack and I feel awful about it and I'm... I'm sorry, I didn't... I... Oh! So I'm living in Tucson and I don't want to stay there anymore but I don't really know where else to go. And it's... I'm having a... just having a hard time, so. I'm sorry, yeah. I'm not... [laughs embarrassingly] I'm gonna start crying again. -Yeah. -This is a thing with me, all right? I really think it's your fault, honestly. Why is it my fault? You use to give me the best head rubs. And they use to really take the edge off. Quit hiding the jelly beans Hand 'em up. Come on. Give me some jelly beans, okay? That's why I'm so sad 'cause you won't [chuckles] give me any jelly beans. [Jim sighs deeply] It's also little hard 'cause you're really impressive. Your life is really impressive. -Yeah... -So there's a part of me that's... just saying. I was getting on the plane and there was this family and this little boy, he was so mad and just irate and of course he has no way of expressing any of that except sort of just like... scream and stomp his feet and... I mean, he was screaming so loud that tongue was curing to the back of his mouth and tears were just like... you know, springing out of his face he was... leaking you know. And I just remember looking at him and being very jealous. You know, that's my soul-mate. [laughing] Me and that four year old. That's my soul-mate. I don't know some point we just learn it's better not to do that and... I don't know at what point... Here. You ate a lot of them. I did eat a lot. You left me all the pink and purple ones [chuckles] Yeah, they are your favorites. [phone buzzing] What's up? Miss Elissa wants to know where's her ice-cream is at? Of course. Oh God! Does she like ice-cream soup. [chuckles] I'm just telling her I ran into some one. Don't take it person... sorry yes. Okay fine I'll tell her it's you just... -She'll ask me who. -She's gonna ask... -there is is. -Jim. Lisa, Lisa the interrogator. Holy fuckity fuck! Jim, Jim? She's Lisa Lising you. [laughs] Yeah Jim Jim, Yes. She wants to know how you look. [phone buzzes] She wants to know, when I'm coming back. I kinda want to see your house. You want to see the house? [Jim sighs deeply] It's been really great catching up with you. But if the reason you spending time with me is because... you feel sorry for me. You don't have to do it, it's okay. Okay? [mellow music playing] [lock clicking] Sorry, just the boxes. Sorry. [Amanda] It's okay. Here we go. Yeah, still got a lot of... her stuff to pack up. Yeah That's a good one in particular. Yeah, I'll say. Yeah, pretty much how she left it so... I've been thinking about... dry walling where the paneling is maybe take out that wall, so that it opens into the kitchen. I don't know there's also something kind of... cozy about the way it is. Thinking about it. Anyway, make yourself at home. I'm gonna go to the bathroom. Will see you in a sec. [door shuts] [piano music playing] [chuckles] Oh, my god. This is a very serious collection of romance novels. This could not have been here... when we were spending all that time I think there were some I think she really started collecting -when I left and I wasn't here to... -Yeah... -We would have a field day with it. -Yeah. Well, I mean let's face it, in your hay-day you were pretty... In my hay-day? you were pretty romantic. I'm remembering... when you read Wuthering Heights and you made me read it and you sent me that... I think it was four legal page... -Jim, that's extreme... -letters about... You called me Heathcliff and you called your self Catherine. -I am you and you are me. -Please stop it! Yes so, by the way Completely humiliating. don't pretend you're all above this. There's a very big difference. I would like to point out between this lovely array of books and the great work of art and literature that is Wuthering Heights. I mean they cannot be compared. Here's something for you. "Right away. she knew that her heart and soul belonged to Justin." What Justin? There's no sexier name than Justin. "Oh, Justin! Do it to me Justin." -Oh, come on. -Sorry. No, there's more. "But it wasn't until tonight that she realized Justin also owned her body." I'm sorry there's no comparison between this and Wuthering Heights. -It really, first of all... -It's really sacrilegious thing... I don't want to think about my mother reading it. You know what? Neither do I, I have to say. I've been staring at these books I'm trying to figure out how to get rid of them Why? Well, I don't know, it's weird like I had this weird... I had a very strange mortality moment when I looked at them and I was like this eight hundred books here, and even if I... for some reason wanted to read all of these books I wouldn't be able to finish all of these books before I died. That's a weird thing, you know the math of that. Pretty morbid thought. No just... not to be morbid but just a thing. Well... you know it's all relative, I think. I mean, my husband you know... maybe he would make it through this, section. If you were lucky. -I don't know. -Yeah. Can I... do you mind if I go out side? I have to make a phone call. Yeah, yeah of course. You know the way. Yes I do. [door slams] [foot steps departing] [water splashing] [Amanda] I know, I'm sorry. I meant to call you, yeah. The minute I got there she sent me right out to get some food. Oh, yeah she seems really... she seems really good. Yeah, she's just hungry. [laughing] I think we're just gonna stay in. Just you know... watch a movie or... you know and eat. [chuckles] Yeah. Wait, can you just say that again I didn't hear you. Yeah. This is amazing. This is amazing, it's like a time capsule. It's all here. You needed the black light... Hey it was 1993 you needed a black light. Yeah I adore the black light. You want to watch some, Friends? -Try outs? -Try outs. The other option is I could draw a little Gin Blossoms. Yes would you? Or... Maybe Tilda weds Brocket? I hate the sound of Tilda weds... Fine, Blues Traveler. I like Blues Traveler. Oh, Well, well... [chuckles] You literally have every shirt you wore in high school still. My mom kept stuff, that's just... God, yeah. I remember wearing this one. This one. I think this one is mine. [laughing] Oh, I always hated this one. [Jim] I looked good in that. You did not look good in it, like a weird lumber jack. You say that, like it's a bad thing. It is a very bad thing. Well, you know I'm sorry. [gasps in surprise] [vocalizing] -That's private property. -Oh really? Have some respect, okay? For what? For your privacy? Yes, exactly. You probably read these to me out loud. It's called privacy. No, no, that's private. Oh, my... "The winds of change are fucking blowing tonight." -No. Don't read. -No. -Don't read, no. -"Amanda... Amanda. Who knew her name was going to be Amanda. -What a face." -Hey! "What a spirit. My lips said hello my friend but my heart said hello my future. I don't even know myself anymore. Jim has been ripped in half but I'm so happy to bleed, for there is Amanda." Oh, my God! You want Japan or New York? New York Oh, my God! [laughing] I found a picture of you that is outrageous. You don't deserve this by the way. Digging through my stuff. Listen man, you don't have lock on your shit it's bound to get broken into. Man, I can't believe you still have all this stuff. Little crazy. [Jim] Mom was a bit of a hoarder. Yeah. Do you dare? Are you brave enough? "The winds of fucking change are blowing tonight." Fuck you. "This first classic performance is entitled hanging out, May 1994." Oh my God! I don't know whats happening. Good luck. [Amanda] What's it gonna be? Oh boy! [rap dual playing] [Amanda] She just don't understand Oh, she jealous, she jealous [Jim] That's right folks and mamma her mamma and mamma had a son -she just don't understand. -No way. She's jealous, she's jealous, she's jea... [both] Oh no! You fuckin' taped over it, -I was recording over... -God damn it. We were running out of tape. -Wait hold on. -[Amanda] Welcome home. [Jim] Thanks sweetheart so good to see you. [kissing] [Amanda] How is work? [Jim] You know Glen Donavon is canceling his account with us. Twenty three years doing business together just like that, can you believe it? Oh, business. 23 years with Glen Donavon... [Jim] I'm sorry. [Amanda] I've got little something to cheer you up. I've got something to cheer you... Not that. You are in a late night Cinemax movie. [Amanda] Close your eyes. -Why? -Just do it! See I'm the boss, even then. -[Jim] What are you doing? -[shushing] Would you be patient? -I'm not patient. -Jim, come on. Okay, open them. [Jim] Oh, my God! [Amanda] Happy 40th anniversary lover. [Jim] Oh, my God! Look at this meal look what you did. Sweetheart, it's beautiful. I'm so thankful, I didn't get you anything. I'm sorry, I forgot.

[Amanda] I better be your favorite. [Jim] So did you talk to Jessica yet today? -I did. -And? [Amanda] And she got it. [Jim] Yes, yes! Oh, I knew she would. I mean two years in -she's already getting promoted. -But, are you surprised? [Amanda] Ever since she was three years old she started telling me what to ware I think we knew not to worry. [Jim] Now I know our poor Jason was a little -Yeah. -odd on the phone today. [Amanda] I think it's so hard when your big sister is so successful. [Jim] Yeah must be, but he's so wonderful in his own way. He's gonna find it, I know he will. [Amanda] He's got your eyes. He's got your heart. [both chuckling on recording] [Amanda] We've got that great couple of kids. [Jim] Oh yeah, they got a great mom. -Best mom in the whole world. -Best dad in the whole world. It's kinda funny like... having the house to ourselves again, isn't it? All those years with the four of us running around, bumping in to each other. It's back down to the two of us. [Amanda] Yeah. -But it's nice. -Yeah, it's nice. [Jim] Hey, I'm really sorry I forgot to get an anniversary present. [Amanda] It's okay. [Jim] I feel really bad, I'm gonna go to the bathroom I'll be quick. [footsteps departing] [Amanda gasps] Jim, what are you doing? Oh, just nothing. Here open it, open it. [Amanda] You got us tickets to see Annie Lennox? [Jim] Yes I did. Happy anniversary to you late dancing. [Amanda] You're such a bitch, you tricked me.

[laughing and yelling] -You're still like an old man. -Surprise! You're still like an old man. [Jim] I actually believe that you could really cook. [laughing hysterically] -Kiss me. -Hey. -Here's to 80 more. -Yeah. [Amanda] Hundred and twenty more. -Yeah we can do that, right? -Yeah. [recorder clicks] We weren't very cool. No, we were deeply uncool. That was really... Yeah. [rumbling] I wonder where that plane's going. It's not coming here. [laughing] You'd think... That town down there? -Suck! -Suck! Although, you know what it's the fact that it's dark. You can't quite see the shithole-ness. That is right. And actually right now... It does look kinda pretty. It's kinds nice -Right? -Yeah. Not so bad. What's on your mind, eh? Is it that obvious? I was really... little unnerving... back there, listening to all that stuff. I mean, I seemed quite... fun. -First of all. -Your rapping career didn't turn out the way you hoped it would, I think. I understand. [both laughing] It's almost like I don't know who that person was on the tape. I remember her really well. She was really fun, wasn't she? Yeah she's great. -Yeah. -And I... Don't get me wrong it's not that my... life isn't that... I just... -Amanda? -What? I understand. You don't have to explain it to me. Would you like to have some fun tonight? [laughing] Like just some... stupid ass... fun, tonight. Well now I'm scared. What you gonna do? Do you trust me?

[screaming] Backwards, this is how. [screaming] Yeah. Pop. Jump, jump. [moaning] [giggling] Yeah, okay. Enough with the moaning. Enough of that, take it easy. You know I was kidding when I was on the rock but seriously... I don't want to punch anybody as long as you rub my head I'm good. [moaning] No, that means it's ending don't do that. Don't do that.

I've waited very long time for this. You can't rush greatness, okay? Take it easy, all right? If you want to experience the ancient art of phrenology, you really need to wait and get that right. Come again? Okay, well if you had seen men at work the classic Charlie Sheen, Emilio Estevez film, from 1990 you'd know. It's when you... you know feel and interpret someones skull features and you kind of see what's going on in there. So I get up in here... and I say... see that knot right there that says you're a terrible cook. Okay, you're shitty. Shut up. This... I'm getting this straight from the skull features you are a lover of animals. Yeah, you knew that already because I told you that I run a dog rescue. Tell about your doggies. Haven't really heard you talk about it much. It was Chris' idea actually. What's that? That I open the rescue. -That's cool. -Yeah I love the idea of you hanging out with... little Freddy like gray hounds. Taken care of them, I miss Freddy. We don't really... we don't do the gray hound thing. What do you mean? You're like the gray hound queen. Yeah they're just sitting around they're not practical. Chris pointed out and he's right that you know... We have lot of special needs. They take a lot of work, we are a small organization and then it's manageable. I guess I just... you love gray hounds, I mean. Yes I do. -Yeah. -Yeah. Always think of them as people waring fur-coat. I know. I just always have felt understood by them. That makes sense. I don't know they want to be around people. I don't know, feel what they feel I can't explain it, it's... I can tell that they know that being out in the world is hard. Yeah. And they feel it and just want to be like nuzzled up and... They want to make you feel better. They have that instinct of wanting to be close and I don 't know. And you can take a gray hound even with all of it's things that come with owning them or caring for them or rehabilitating them. You take the oldest, neediest, most anxious, broken down gray hound and if you take that dog to the beach and you take off his collar... he will just fucking run. Like he was still young. Yeah. Just tear down that beach. It's like sand flying and tongue is hanging out of his mouth and he's so... I don't know, so beautiful. I think you should think about working with gray hounds. [sighing] Yeah. [mellow music playing] d [Jim] Decent amount of stars tonight. Can I tell you something? Anything. I've been taking anti-depressants... for a while. I haven't told anyone. You know, not even Chris. You know, I don't know why... I feel so embarrassed... about taking them. And it's probably because there's nothing you know, there's nothing wrong with my life. I should be happy. But there's this... sadness... and I don't know where it comes from. Well, I can understand that. The drugs are... They're weird. They're... literally haven't cried in five years. Yeah I don't have that particular problem myself. Can I ask you something? Anything. Why don't you talk to Chris about it? I don't know. There was a time when I... I would have. But things, things are just kind of changing They're just, changing now. How so? Bryce is off to college and Theo is right behind him. Chris is almost 64 now. Wow! What? I mean I knew he was older I didn't really think he was that much older. Yeah well, you know. -It's not nothing. -Yeah. I've loved... I've loved... being a mom to those kids you know. I just, I don't know what it's going to be like when they're gone and sometimes I look at Chris and I think... Oh, my God! Am I going to be taking care of an elderly person soon? I knew it, you know I knew it. Going in but somehow... Being faced with just the two of us alone in the house. I don't know. It's real now. -Yeah. -I get it. -Hey. -Hey, what? You know, I want to say thank you. Why, what for? For tonight. For remembering my pink and purple jelly beans You know. For never making me feel, wrong... about who I am. What? I just... You're embarrassed on my behalf. No, just had a though and it's... What? Nothing, no really... I just told you something that I never told anyone and I thing you should... I was thinking about... our first time. In the back of this truck. At the lake. All 38 seconds of it. Oh, shut up. I was excited. I was sixteen, okay? I've developed some serious skills since then, in fact I've been servicing the entire Tucson, Arizona area... -with... -What are you, a plumber? It's funny though 'cause... never really been like it was with us. For me. You know, that's a nostalgia thing. Yeah. -So it's... -Yeah. This is same for me. -Really? -Yeah. It's something about those dumb kids. Yeah. -Pain is something. -Yeah. Magic. It's magic, yeah that's right. Jim? Yeah. Will you kiss me. I know what I'm asking for... [both moaning] I love you. No. [breathing heavily] I have to go Jim. -Amanda. -Jim, please. Listen, I don't want you to go. Please! Please, will you just please give me a minute. Okay, listen. It's confusing I get it, okay I just want... We can talk about it. I don't want to talk about it. I don't want to talk about it. I should not have let this game go on for so long. This is not a game to me though. Do you understand that I am married? I understand. Do you know what that means? I belong to someone else Will you please give me a little bit of room. Fuck is my coat? [breathing heavily] Where did you get this? It was in your closet. You just took it? Yeah. Why? Well, it's addressed to me. First of all. And second of all I wanted to read it. Well this is just a game to you, Amanda then why do you need to read a letter that I wrote to you 22 years ago? What is this... What could this possibly mean to you? You know, I don't know. I just wanted to read it. This is my letter. -I know that and I'm sorr... -No I don't think you understand that. I think you need to understand something that this is my letter. Okay, this belongs to me. And you can't come into my house, and just take this and do what ever you want with it, without asking me, because it's mine too. You understand me? What is this? That was my baby too. Okay? It was ours. What... It was ours. [Jim crying] You just fucking... Why did you? Fucking! [thumping] Why did you do that? Jim? Why did you do that? You... I was a scared kid! I didn't know how to handle it. You had to give me a minute. You fuckin' went away. You were the one who told me that we were too young. I was scared. Why did you fucking do it? It was our life! [sobbing] Boy! When we were so happy. [gasping] We lost it. We lost everything. Jim. [crying] Fuck! [breathing heavily] [shushing] Oh God! [Amanda] Breath. Okay. Take a deep breath please. [Jim]I'm sorry. I'm sorry too. I'm really sorry. I'm really sorry too. [mellow music playing] [birds chirping] d d [birds chirping] d Okay. I need you to understand something. I didn't just irrationally make the decision to do what I did. And I know... I see now that it was incredibly hard on you. But I was the one who had to go in there and actually do it. Actually go through with it. You know? And I do get that I didn't handle it well, I didn't... I just... I tortured myself. Going over the options, alone in my bedroom. Going over and over, what I should do. And then you sent me that stupid note. Making all those weird, sarcastic jokes and... And then you sent me that stupid get well soon balloon, a balloon, Jim. I don't know there was something about it where it became so clear to me that you were too young... to handle it. We were too young to handle it. And I knew that I was gonna have to go through it alone and I knew I couldn't, do it alone. And you know... Do I have regrets? Yes. Yes. But... What can we do? Here. Please. You just read it now. "Amanda, I know we can get through this together. You are my world. I will never stop loving you." It was the first version that I wrote to you. Why didn't you send this to me? I was scared. It was just stupid. I'm sorry. [laughing] I'm contagious. Apparently. Now it's just never gonna stop. [sighing] [guitar music playing]
