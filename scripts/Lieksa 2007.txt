I leave everything and go. -Not for the first time. But now for sure! We, the family Koppel, tailors. We were well known in St. Petersburg in the 19 century. Yeah, and we all can snore and fart simultaneously. Especially Hippo. During a revolution, the family fled in Finland, across the bay on the ice riding.

Neither I nor anyone else will flee at Laszlo. Let's fight. Mom, do you remember the story of Sofia's time in Poland? The story? Yes. Na? What have we to lose anymore? Time to dig a grave. Family Kopello were no heroes, at least not the man. It was women who were strong. The man's victories came only through suffering. But now, when hope deserted them and they were getting ready to do - Koppelo family was at its strongest. They relied on each other and had a family Koppelo - sagerna with all its traditions and beliefs. A moment of happiness, a moment of death. More than ever, Kasper wanted to be part of this family and its fate. Anna! Those who fought against the dragons know that they can not be defeated by ordinary sword. Old Niccolo felt that the dirtiest battles await. Laszlo. You fight with the children. You stabbed your father, Are you insane? Ga right now, I'll spare you. Shame! Just Punch and Lara stood as the winner. Niccolo won the battle, but lost his son. Laszlo lost his family, but like a scarab - He found a dynghog with like-minded friends. He was not the highest like fowl, but the key is associated. To be part of a community and to be accepted as I am. Koppelo family have always been great to leave. Martta and Veera was equal to live in amity with each other. Martta felt that she Veera lost some of its hardness. Earlier, Martta to persuade Veera to stay - but now she no longer had the power to it. Mama knew that winter was near, and the journey must be continued. For her it was easier to travel than to stay. For Kasper and Lara was Lieksa weeks before the start of a new life. Kasper moved in with Lara and happy life began to get traction. The cold was stra tion day by day. the family stayed warm with the dream of future happiness in Lieksa. Repeat and now skraddarmastariden Hippo took seriously - and planned to work with Martta open a ATELIER Lieksa.

If they all come back! -They do enough. Deep down, they are nice boys. Anna, play some more. Here we are waiting, close to the pearly gates Lieksa. It s Martta who led us hither. Marta is restless. She has every reason to be scared. She knows that her hard are made from any fragile. In a few days, we experienced more than a life so far. In Lieksa everything. Much of it all. Too much. Lieksa is not for us. Lieksa is too much for us. Martta and Jori. Helena. Roosa, Ventti and Anna. Hippo and Repeat. Lara! During this journey with you, I have learned - that luck is only a mirage on the road ahead. Perhaps we should just move on, even if we go wrong. "He speaks. If we stop we die. "He thought. Roads leading to towns and villages, but the most important is the journey. We should not mourn the past. It has been ar just a high ash. We now have a new way to go.
