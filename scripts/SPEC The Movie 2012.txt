The first two of these prophecies... ...seemed to come true. World War I ended, but World War II began. The rise of the USSR then brought global confrontation. Attention focused on the Third Secret. For decades the Vatican concealed its contents. On May 13th, 1981... ...Pope John-Paul II was shot in St Peter's Square... ...it was said this was the third of the Fatima prophecies. (The Pope survived.) The shooting was not a minor incident... ...but it differed in scale from the first two prophecies. One of the children had also said... ...the Third Secret was a call to righteousness. Another Vatican official denied it was a prophecy of war and apocalypse... ...calling it a revelation of the savagery of humankind. This suggests the Vatican... ...still conceals the gist of the Third Secret. What does it in fact say? Humanity... ...is now... ...is about to find out. Dear Miyabi... The fact you are reading this... ...means I am no longer in this life. Toma and Sebumi have most likely... ...left it as well. I kill. I want you to live on, and tell history the real truth. We of the UnCrimes Office... ...Public Security Bureau 5, Tokyo Metropolitan Police... ...investigate supernatural cases involving spec-holders. One person in a million... ...is born with specifications bringing unusual powers. This is thought to result from the evolution of the human brain. In recent years, they have grown rapidly in number. Perhaps the magic of your beauty is your particular spec. What do you want?! Spec-holders were hiring each other for their different powers... ...and battling for control of corporations and entire nations. They also fought each other, repaying blood with blood However... ...that was now a minor consideration. The rampage of the spec-holders had begun. As you are aware, elements of Simple Plan have been stolen. Three of five did not arrive. There must be a leak. Perhaps. Teams 2 and 3 have been forced into a different route. There are too many mysteries. Mary in the Third Secret... Leaving the Pope aside... ...what is the angel with the fiery sword pointing to? The angel with the sword in her left hand? You mean her? Fatima's third prophecy has come to pass. It all started one hot, hot summer's day. Hello? It's freezing! Like a fridge! Hey! Can you hear me? Are you asleep? They're all dead! The summer grasses: all that remains of the dreams of brave warriors.' Out of Order Oda's 2,000 men advance... ...on the Imagawa camp. Just at that moment, a heavy rain... ...hides the sound of horses and men! Sebumi, are you nuts? Small things amuse small minds? You're taking too much space! And are you having fun? I love these life-size model gyoza dumplings! The filling looks so real, but when you put the dough on... ...you can't see it at all. What great design! Some of these skins even look a bit over-boiled. Ecstasy! Waste of time. Well, oh yeah? What the hell?! That took me 448 hours! What did you do to my gyoza?! Cut it out, you two! Hey, gyoza. Thanks. The glue's not dry yet. Nice. Coming in! Miyabi! You're a law student now. Why are you in uniform? Like it? And how! Just for you. Voovam! I present... ...Superintendent-General Nitanai... ...and the Director of Cabinet Intelligence... ...Mr. Fukutomi! Superintendent General?! Cabinet Intelligence?! Who are they? They're big. I like 'em big. I mean bigwigs. Come in! I'm at your service. SPEC: HEAVEN You didn't have to come to this mouldy old office. We'd be happy to come to yours. That wouldn't work. We didn't want to be seen. We've come with an important request. Mummified? A mummy... The same as Kikkawa... Someone's trying to tell us something. Tell us? That's right. They're telling us... '...give up Simple Plan, or we'll do the same...' '...to all of you.' 'We spec-holders... ...can do anything.' 'With our talent pool, we now control...' '...nation-states and major corporations.' 'And now we're going to take over the subcode of the entire planet!' Sir? You won't get away with it! Help! They're possessed? What are you looking at?! Come on, Class of '82! Are you all right, sir? Are you hurt? Did you do this?! You better not have laughed! What's 'Simple Plan'? Never heard of it! You're the ones who said it. Now tell us what it means. You're hiding something. Come on, Class of '82. Don't call me that, Class of '65! What's that mean? To hell with your old school! I went there, too. Class of '72. So the spec-holders are starting an all-out battle... ...to take over the world? This may be beyond the powers of the UnCrimes Section already. Don't you worry. We will avenge... ...Kikkawa. How? They took the file away. I've already hacked that. If two of the country's top public-security officials... ...came to get us going... ...we pretty well have to solve the case, don't we. Yeah, but... ...let's not be in a rush. It's OK. We're going. We'll clear this up with our bare hands. Sounds good. See ya! Summer! The sea! Uh, it's September... I guess we should resign ourselves to the inevitable. I've already done that, Gori. I've already gotten all my body-doubles killed for nothing. And I created traitors, too. I'm Sukehiro Tsuda. I'm on your side. Toma's blocked. Don't call yourself Tsuda! You traitor! I'll be responsible. Don't beat yourself up over it. It's going to be a long war. 'No smoking'. Times have changed. No Smoking One of the five elements of Simple Plan. 'Goetia'. Somehow we have to stop the third prophecy... ...from coming true. Ole! Sebumi, what's wrong? Nothing. It's hot. Global warming. Take this 'cool hood'. I bought it on Mamazon. The cruiser loaded up and left at 10am. All aboard had been mummified when it was found... ...at 5 that afternoon. Wait... who are you? Police. No leftovers in the garbage... ...so they probably died around lunchtime. You OK with that? Yeah. Next. Here, Daddy! No, thanks. Huh? A- ha! Shut up! Jun! I'm sorry. Your granddaughter? He was trying to steal her ice. I'm sorry. She keeps running off. Give the man back his ice. No! It's mine! It's hers. She brought it over. What? I didn't buy it... We're going. Quick! Mystery number 1. At sea, in this heat, the food didn't spoil. Chinese food, fried fish, gyoza, fried octopus, tofu... Maybe they don't go bad. It's hot... Mystery 2. A closed cabin out at sea. Mystery 3: no trace of a perpetrator. No finger or footprints. I'm having a heart attack! And mystery number 4. The victims had no relatives. No wives, parents, or siblings. It's global warming. Maybe they were government operatives concealing their identities. Keep your voice down. You mean Ninomae's 'dimple plan'? It's 'Simple Plan'! Don't make it sound like a girly bar. I have the feeling it's not much of a plan. So you just want spec-holders to kill each other off? Surely not. The simpler the better. Damn right! Mr. Sebumi! Help! Mirei? What's wrong? I don't know! Someone's after me! I've got a bad feeling about this! Here he comes! Who's after her?! I wouldn't know! It doesn't surprise me, though. But weren't you feeling hot? Mirei, get down! Mirei! Watch out behind. Freeze! You circled ahead... You messed up. So did you. Hands up... ...or I shoot. Lift your hands! 'Lift'? You weren't alone... Ms Toma! Up yours! Twin guns... Don't tell me... Satoko? Ta-kay-roo? What is this, 'Kill Bill'? You're alive? We have orders. If you interfere, you're subject to elimination. What? Nothing. Stay out of it. Aoike was an American SEAL, one of our SWAT team instructors. Who's Aoike? Oh, you mean Satoko, who calls you 'Ta-kay-roo'? You like foreign girls? She means nothing to me. Watch your mouth! I couldn't care less... ...'Ta-kay-roo'. Pork cutlet over rice. Don't let the soup get cold. You've got no reason to hold me. This is the only room open. We bear you no mallet. 'Malice'. Shimura, Birei... Mirei. Last Monday you bought a used 'Winter Sonota' DVD set... ...at a store in Godanda. 'Gotanda'. Haven't you seen that yet? Then Wednesday you went onloan and sold it. 'Onloan'?! Bet she didn't get much. Skip the commentary. What did you see when you touched this box? Nothing. Can I ask one thing? What? Look straight into my eyes. A person who feels guilty... ...can't keep her eyes still for more than three seconds. There's something about that box, isn't there. There! They moved. What did you see? Nothing. You're lying! You damn bully! Stay here. He's lying about the eyes to put pressure on her! Of course your eyes move! He's bluffing. No. Scare a witness, and you control the answers. It's like torture. Don't over-analyze. Just watch. Whose side are you on? Calm down. I am calm! Keep it down! I'm sorry. I'm not talking to you. Hey! What are you apologizing for? Uh, can I go now? We can't have you leaving on you now. Say what? The reason is that you know an important secretion. 'Secretion'? What have I done? I'm not a criminal. I didn't want spec powers. They're why I had to quit school, after my brother got shot. What else can I do? If she tells you what she saw, can she go? For now she can say with me. That's 'stay'. Otherwise she might die. I'd rather be dead than stuck with you. What was that? A sedative. We need her alive. You've gone too far! If it's just protective custody, she can stay at my place. Well, if you wouldn't mind, Chief Non-nomura... 'Nonomura'. We have been summoned just to meet you? How insulting! This means life or death for the nation. You disposed of Tsuda the traitor? I apologize for him. What do you wish? One of you... ...is planning an act of terror that will split this country. That's absurd! Split it how? Into spec-holders... ...and everyone else. Oh, dear! Have I said something wrong? That's not possible. Have you lost your mind? 'Simple Plan'. The late traitor Tsuda was looking into that. No one holds this nation more dearly than we do! This is outrageous! I was born in a difficult time. They didn't appreciate your kindness, Madame Yang. Even way out at sea. So it would seem. What a shame! Brrr! What? Stop smoking. It's bad for you. Still a health nut, huh? It goes with the job. CIRO, the Cabinet Research and Intelligence Office... ...made me a special agent. I couldn't tell my parents, my dog, anybody. That's why I left. Kenpachi Murase... ...one of the victims on that boat, owned the DVD set Mirei bought. Tell me about this case, and what Mirei knows. Would I do that? You don't trust me? You'll tell that girl. This isn't about face, it's about case! Your grammar... ...is twisted. It is not! Who are you to talk? Learn Japanese right! I can still read you like a book... ...Ta-kay-roo. You're awake? Want some gyoza? That's an affirmative grunt. Let's go, robots. 'Bing!' 'Gyoza' in mineral water, coming right up! Get it while it's hot! Here it is! Great! Have some. Get it while it's hot! Let it go. Here it comes. Great, huh? Yeah. Yuck! Too much garlic. Good against vampires. Yota? This is awful. You never had any taste. Why are you here? To recruit you, Sis. To recruit me? But... you're alive? No way! Do I look dead? You came when I summoned you with my left arm... Yota! I only have the power to summon the dead. I wasn't summoned. I just appeared to protect you. If I hadn't come from below, you'd have known I wasn't dead. That can't be true! Sure it is. See? It hurts, right? 'Doesn't hurt.' 'Then why didn't you get in touch with me?' Are you nuts?! Then they'd be trying to kill me. So I just played dead. But your heart stopped in the hospital. Well, I had to get out of that cell... ...so I stopped time for my own body... ...and disappeared. I ran and ran. I healed myself... ...and formed a group to fight for power. And now, nobody can take my life from me. Sis... ...lend me your powers. Your place is not on the side of authority. It's with us spec-holders. I'm not a spec now. I can find a spec-holder to fix that arm. And I don't want to be. You're weird, Sis. Yota... ...stop killing people. What are you talking about? I've told you! We're the ones getting killed. The state killed Mom and Dad. What do you mean? I think they had powers, too. I don't know what they were... ...but that plane crash was faked. I know the state killed them. Department Zero has a file. That cruiser incident was to kill spec-holders, too. You mean Simple Plan... So we have to take power from the government to survive. With our powers. So your specs rule? No. Yours are the strongest I know. You can summon the dead... ...and change the whole world. You've changed. Because people want to kill me. I rely only on myself. I'll kill anyone in my way... ...even you. Mr. Ninomae? Hello. You know him? I've had my eye on her for months. Ms Toma... ...why don't we both go with Mr. Ninomae? Sis? I say... ...no. Why not? I'm a cop. A cop is a gangster who fights for the government... ...not for justice. It's Mr. Sebumi, isn't it. So you are a woman! I've never thought about being on one side or another. We all choose our own right path. If the country drives us off it... ...I'll fight it with my last breath. But Yota... ...if you... ...go any further off that path... ...I'll crush you. OK. Next time you see me, give it all you've got. You'll lose, though. 'Bye, Sis. Wait! Take care of that arm. Don't let the third prophecy come true! The third prophecy? What is it? How? Turtle wave attack! So this is where you meet... His Majesty isn't here. We did not know how to explain who you were. I'm a new member of the Council, that's all. Do you really understand what "the Council" is? A selected clique of people... ...the real rulers of Japan... ...for nearly 2,000 years. Shamans, then nobles, then warlords, and now prime ministers. The outward face of power may change, but the chosen ones retain control. A Council of the Wise, directing history... ...along with Masons, the Vatican, overseas Chinese, and Maharajahs. If you know that, then you will understand... ...why you cannot be a member of this Council. Why not? No one, not even the greatest stars, equals us in ability. Decisions on the fate of the world should recognize our superiority. We have resolved not to ally ourselves with a union of mutant freaks. Big talk for an ape... ...and an imposter. Cat got your tongue? Get down! They're shooting from outside! There's no windows! Then where? Here. Who are you? How do you do. I'm Atsushi Ito. Oh, hello! I loved you in Train Man, on Fuji-TV! That's the only channel I watch. What brings you here, Mr. Ito? This will only take a moment. Stab! If you work late... ...we need to discuss new terms. I'm really sorry! Here. Was there anything specially strange? It's all 'specially strange'. That kid is weird! You have a child? You followed me? Well, you know all about what I'm doing... This is illegal enter. 'Entry'. Here, Daddy! Is she mine? Yes. No. Which is it? I'm afraid she isn't yours. The truth! She's not yours. Not at all. Then whose is she? I don't know. What?! Don't get me wrong. I was only ever with you. But her blood type and DNA are completely different. From you, and from me. So who is she, Jesus Christ? Maybe she is. Strange things happen with her. I don't know what to do! I see... You're not involved! Go away! Ow! Cut it out! I've got... I've got... I've got a kid?! "No one, not even the greatest stars, equals us in ability." 'Morning. What's that? Since you're here... ...let's click it back. Ninomae... Yep. Who are those people? From what's being said, something like an 'Emperor's Council'. Really? Probably not. Hey! That's that guy Fukutomi! Here. Who are you? Who's he? An actor, I think. Named 'Ito'. - 'Shiro'? - No. - 'Ran Ito'? - A woman. - 'Yokado'? - Supermarket. His name's Atsushi. He said so. Stab! Burr attack! Just like that! What the...?! Meaning we're getting spec-holders who can shape-shift? They took the bodies to Cabinet Intelligence. All nicely mummified. Mummified? Just like Kikkawa... Hi! It's the spec-holders! We're unbeatable, right? Right! With a wave, we can stop time! Why do they all dry up? I saw your underwear. Oh, behave! Got it! That's my line! The bodies should have arrived where you are by now. Soon Madame Yang will be along to finish you all off. All together... ...see you real soon! Now I'm mad! Sit. Tsuda? But which one? As I am sure some of you are aware... ...we have lost Mr. Fukutomi, of the Cabinet Intelligence Office. Our Public Security Department Zero, our UnCrimes Office... ...and the Public Security, Cabinet, and military intelligence agencies... ...in accordance with their various areas of responsibility... ...have monitored spec-holders with undercover operations... ...and made arrests where necessary. Since spec-holders have never united, we have always treated these cases... ...as isolated incidents. But the group formed around Juichi Ninomae... ...is carrying out actions... ...that threaten the nation. Here. You, there! Stop snacking! You talk too much. What?! I'll take it from here, sir. As of today, I lead the 'Anti-Spec-holders Team'. Its members will include everyone here. I am Director of the Public Security Special Duties Organization... ...Sukehiro Tsuda XXIV. 'XXIV'? The 24th. All the other Tsudas were body doubles. Finally we see the real one. As of 1030 hours today... ... the Prime Minister has given us our orders. We are to take Juichi Ninomae and those with him... ...dead or alive... ...using any means. You mean we kill them? Without a trial? We must... ...defend our citizens against these terrorists! Questions? Aoike... It is possible there is a spy amongst our midst. Who? Saya Tooma. Juichi Ninomae's real name is Yota Tooma. He is Saya Tooma's... ...small brother. Um... ...Yota 'Toma' is Saya Toma's younger brother. Yep. What the hell?! All right. I'll look into this. Listen up! You will be informed of your missions in one hour. Stand by. Private communications are forbidden. Until this duty is complete... ...it is as if you do not exist. That is all. Dismissed! That feels so good! Why have you taken Ninomae's side? What do you mean? I thought you preferred big corporations... ...run by Overseas Chinese and Jewish interests. I was just interested in the money back then. 'Back then'? I grew up poor. Then when I discovered my spec powers... ...people started giving me lots and lots of money. At first I loved it. I had a great time. That'd be nice. Truth to tell... ...I'm coming to the end of my life. Now I want to devote myself to the children who will evolve... ...in the future. That's why I'm working with Ninomae for free. For me, Ninomae is the light... ...of my hope. But what if... What? What if, instead of being the light of your hope... ...he's leading you into the dark? I don't care. Eventually Ninomae and I will both sink into the dark. The dark must rise. People are fools. Only the dark will make them wish for the light. That's why we have nuclear power and politicians. Here. Thank you. Who's this? Thank you! Jun's gone again. Outside calls blocked Assemble in 15 minutes What's wrong? You look pale. Nothing. Let's get started. Sit. Tonight at 2000 hours... ...we eliminate Ninomae. He is thought to be hiding within the capital region. Our intelligence-unit data suggests seven possibilities... Nope. Here I am! Ta-da! I screwed up. Superintendent! How?! Don't worry about me. Carry out your mission. You're on! Death! Give up? No. I may die, but I will not give in to terrorists! Don't let this stop you! OK, how about this girl? Jun! Who's that? Ms Aoike's daughter. Bastard! Yota! Let the girl go. I just want to be heard. The Superintendent isn't enough. Get over here. If you don't... ...this. As you can see, we can't say what will happen. Commencing operation! UnCrimes, Sebumi! And me? Everyone from CIRO except Aoike and Miyano. Everyone from military Intelligence. I want to come! You stay here. Let me come! No. You and Miyano watch Toma. Am I a prisoner? Prepare to move! Aoike... ...trust us. I swear I'll bring Jun back. Toma... ...take care of things. Well, let's go get something to eat. This is good! Then we'll be on our way. Already?! Where? To save Jun, of course. She's Sebumi's daughter. No. He thinks so. He's wrong. Come on! Uh, Toma... You put something in... Mr. Non-nomura? Myano? Suckers! What's going on?! I put our jailers to sleep. I think you might be a spy. I might shoot you, you know. Only I can stop Ninomae. You'd better trust me if you want to save Jun. You just want to help Ta-kay-roo. I'm a cop! My feelings don't affect my job. But Sebumi's my partner, so I'm going to help him... ...or die trying. Sorry all to hell. Toma? The mooks are here! 'Mooks'?! Just kidding! I'll tell you what I need you to do. All right! Ecstasy! Stacy X! All aboard had been mummified... Dry up! Fan The food didn't spoil... Atsushi Ito. Chestnut burr Burr attack! Sis! Cat Poison Shock Toma! Got it. Get me these. Right. Ham it up! Shazam! You hate me. Yep. Because of Ta-kay-roo? Don't worry. I won't let my feelings interfere with saving Jun. No one's without feelings. Do you know why I'm on this case? My daughter has spec powers. I have a sitter protecting her. I'm only on this case to keep her out of danger. Getting along? The pigs are coming in. Use this if you have to. I don't know how. That's OK. It's loaded. Just pull the trigger. And shoot who? Ms Toma? Mr. Sebumi? They're my friends. I'll put guards on you. Don't worry. A cocoon? File loaded I'm too fat! I want to eat! The new Mammoth diet! What's wrong? Mummified... Damn it! What's going on?! I'm too fat! I want to eat! The new Mammoth diet! Stay here. You're handsome. I want to eat! I want to eat! Set! Spike! Damn! My feet are stuck! You're too good-looking to dry out. I'll just freeze you solid. Oh yeah? Ice Lager! Ow! Ow'm I doing? That's all I can stand! I can't stand no more! The skin ripped off! I want to eat! Spare! Strike! Fore! Ow! I'll kill you! Madame Yin! Fire! Fire! Fire! I'm not... ...some... ...fried fish! Agh! That's hot! Sebumi! That's hot! Madame Yang! That's cold! Hot! Cold! Hot! Cold! Die! It's frozen! Mammoth, mammoth, sexy sexy... ...Marilyn! Kill Bill! What the...?! It was frozen! Why?! Low-temperature oil. Here. Thanks. What's... ...this for? Your power is desiccation with heat and cold. You freeze-dried your victims like instant food... ...but you lose. Find Jun. Jun! Tell me where she is, or I'll blow... ...that pretty face off. Jun! There's no one else here. Sebumi! Where is she?! Toma! Aoike! Of course she isn't here... ...stupid! Why, you... Goodbye, Madame Yang, Madame Yin. They're dead. Forget them. Get the rest. 'Forget them'? They were our friends! Octopus! Look out! Aoike! Satoko! You saved me... It's OK. Don't worry about it. I was like a moth drawn to... ...a frame... More! More Finish them off! Giant octopus! Quick! More! Toma! Toma... Toma, no! That is the hand... ...of history. You can close it in... ...but it will not be denied. Or will it... ...awaken Solomon's Key? Meow! No! Let go! Her power's back! Mirei flash! Are you OK? She's losing blood. The peritoneum might be ruptured! Prepare transfusion! I was off-guard... Don't apologize. I back up my partners. We'll have Jun back for you when you wake up. Hurry! Super-miracle Yoga Hello! We got what you wanted. The big stuff's in the vehicle. Thank you. You can go now. No. We'll help. We might get killed this time. We're detectives, too. We're ready for that. That's fine by us! And me, too. I'd like to come, too. I still like to see action. No. As Director, your place is sitting at your desk here. You ought to be sitting. I'm fine. I've conquered the pain with mercurochrome and yoga. Still hurts, huh? You'd be in the way. Stay off my case. OK, then... what about Jun? If Ms Aoike doesn't make it, she's your responsibility. What's that got to do with this? She got hurt because of me. This is my responsibility. You can't fight like that. Look after yourself. Excuse me! We attack as soon as we find Ninomae. Mirei? Ms Toma... Ninomae's here. Mirei? Put Mr. Sebumi on. Mirei! I'll be right there. Hang in there. Don't feel guilty any more. Don't be silly. Ms Toma... ...look after her. Mirei... Mirei?! Calm down. Trace that call. That's where you'll find... ...Ninomae. I'll plan out how we take Ninomae, all right? Our chances? On gut feeling, 1 per cent. But with any other plan, the chances are zero. All right. I'm ready to go with that. Are there any objections from her Director? With old age just ahead, what objections would I have? No one will be compelled to take part in this mission. Volunteers, step forward. Toma, full speed ahead on your plan. Get ready! Here you are... Why are you still brooding? Ever since I was a year old I've been wondering... ...why the earth gave rise to creatures like human beings. And why do creatures have to evolve? And who decides how they do? If human beings... ...and all living creatures... ...are vehicles for DNA to leave copies of itself behind... ...as a scholar named Dawkins says... ...when does that vehicle... ...finally get where it's going? And if spec-holders are its last stop... ...does that mean... ...we're defying the will of the world? They're criminals. Our job is to maintain public security. Security? Security for who? I get the sense that something isn't equal. Meaning what? Spec-holders are people, too. Those powers come from self-interest. Not evolution. They're pure ego. We treat them as monsters, when they just want to live! That left arm of yours... It's nothing. You're lying! Your power is overcoming your will. You know that. Be careful. Toma! Time will not turn from its course. Those who would stop it... ...I kill. I finally know why... ...we met. Toma... ...you go on ahead. When I settle things here... ...I'll follow you. Goodbye for now. Shoot. Shit! Did I...? Forget it. Why... ...didn't you shoot me dead? I couldn't shoot you. I've failed... ...as a policeman. No. You're a fine officer. Sebumi, we're detectives. Solving crimes is what people think we do. But there's more to it than that. Know what I mean? No. What we should be doing... ...is leading history along the right path. Or so I think. You stay alive and risk your tiny life for the sake of history. That is the labor of a public servant. One day this day will stand before the judgment of history. The day will come when we are accused. This nation, and its police have gone wrong many times. But now... ...we must not take history down the wrong path. You have the spirit of a detective. You're a fine officer. Yes, sir. And Toma... Yes? I've known for a long time there were risks... ...with this new type of human being called 'spec-holders'. From simple things like being driven mad by your own abilities... ...to possessing abilities that science cannot explain. Your powers... ...that make you either god or devil, are the most dangerous. So most important for you is your discernment. 'Discernment'? The ability to discern truth. You're bewildered because you can't. You lose yourself, and become obsessed with the dead. So pursue the truth with every last breath in you. That is the only thing in which a true detective... ...finds any meaning. One minute! Proceed according to plan. First, secure hostages. Are you dressed for this? This is how I dress. Good luck. And you. Team 1, forward! Roger! Forward! M7, M9, take the Superintendent. Continue the search. Tsuda... I will avenge you. Civet coffee. It's a luxury. Thank you. Are you one of the thornier spec characters? Is that strange? You don't really look that way. Well, I'm really pretty normal. Sure, I did acting, but I always went to school. And worked part-time in a restaurant. Yeah? That's so normal it's abnormal. But... ...I mean, people think they know me... ...but I'm in a thrash band, and I do hard-edged things. One word never really describes a person. I just evolved naturally, the way spec-holders do. Not me. You know that. I'm sorry! Uh-oh... I've been alone for a thousand years. Literally alone. Mr. Ninomae? Fate has called me together. has finally produced an answer. I want to be that answer! Mr. Ninomae! Boss! Boss Ninomae! Mr. Ninomae! This land... ...is almost mine! Commence phase II. Phase II. Poison gas again? Will that help? They might just think it's only morning mist. I'm switching on. Gas masks! Ah, that feels good. Morning mist! Poison gas! Gas? I thought it was mist. They're not very bright. Do they think that'll work again? Turtle! The generator! Retreat! This way, sir! Get him to hospital. The girl? We haven't found her. Mr. Tsuda's still looking. Phase III. Second wave. Take over here. No way! I'm going. You stay here! Not on those feet. I'm on my way. Miyano, take over. That's 'Mr.' Miyano. Damn! The gas didn't work. Forward! Huh? What's going on? We're going in circles. Exit? None, sir. We're coming in the north door. No! It's a trap! Some kind of spec loop has us closed in here. Stab! What? We're getting wiped out. Oh, well... I'll blow the building. Sir! What?! Ninomae! Ito! If you have even a shred of humanity left... ...at least let Jun go! Hey! No way! Everybody out! But sir! Come on! Eat this! Pull back! What a ride! Sebumi! Toma! Sebumi! That was some explosion! The old guy with his spec loop did a good job. Oh, well. That gets rid of Tsuda, Toma, and Sebumi. Now the Council can't ignore us. Or why don't we just kill them all next? Let's go. Hey! Hold it. The fight's not over yet. Well, what do you know! Are you still alive, Sis? In another minute, I'll be asking you that. Toma! Saved by the barrel? Never underestimate a true detective! Yota Toma will give you another chance. Take back the power in your left arm, Sis... ...and work for me. Not a chance. I won't lose to you. And you're not Yota, are you. He wouldn't abandon his friends. And he'd never... ...kill a cat. Then who am I? A clone made with DNA taken from Yota's body. You stopped time for 17 years while you grew into him. Very smart! I won't let you be Yota. Or let a heartless clone trample on lives! I have a heart. Huh? In normal human time, I've been waiting 17 years... ...for the moment the world becomes mine. At last the time has come for me to be happy. Fool. What you get with spec powers has nothing to do with happiness. Real happiness... ...comes from trying, and trying again... ...but failing, and bashing into walls... ...and people letting you down. But then you find real friends, and bond with them in love. Could anyone else mean more than life to you? No. What's left when you're dead? I need you gone. Then kill me if you can. Sebumi... ...I'm dragging you into this. Fine. Stab! It's a trap. Die! What are you thinking of? No one can fight the power to stop time. What's this doing here? It stopped... Wire? Sebumi... Sebumi! Sebumi! Sebumi! I'm totally fine. Think of it as acupuncture. Don't let Ninomae get away. You're a cop, right? Yes. I give up. There'll be an ambulance here soon. Right. I appreciate your consideration. Shit! Here's your line back. Are you still alive? Goodbye, fake Yota. You're a victim. The ones who made you are the real enemy. I swear... ...I'll destroy them. Is it over? Yes. Yeah? Good. Huh? You're awake? Stay down! Where's Sebumi? In the ICU. He's alive? Yes. Don't! Stay here! Are you awake? What's wrong? Don't waste your worry on me. I'm not worrying. I'm amazed you're alive... ...so I'm smiling. Don't sell this body short. When it has to, it moves by itself. You've woken up to your spec power. No one needs spec powers. Progress, evolution... they don't matter. It's what drives someone that's important. 'What drives someone'? You're not the only one who feels... ...the pain that drives you. I have it in me and I live with it, too. Whether you move on as a spec-holder... ...or as a normal person... ...you're still you. For me... ...that will never change. That's... ...what drives me. Shit! How did my life get dragged into yours? Sebumi? Sebumi? Sebumi?! You stink of gyoza. Up yours! Bastard! Like it or not... ...you're going to stay dragged in. After the two revelations... ...we saw an angel beside Mary... ...with a flaming sword... ...in her left hand. As we watched... ...flames spread from the sword... ...in balls of fire... ...as if the entire world... ...would be consumed. 'Repent!'... ...called the angel in a loud voice. However... ...a light shone from Mary's right hand... ...and extinguished the flaming sword. And then... ...in Mary's light... ...we saw the Third Revelation of God. Together with a Pope... ...clothed all in white... ...many Bishops and Priests... ...climbed up a steep mountain. At its peak... ...was a large cross... ...made of twisted logs. They reached the peak... ...and prayed at the cross. Then all at once a group of soldiers... ...killed them all. It was a horrible sight. Two angels drew the martyrs' blood... ...into a crystal jar... ...and carried their spirits... ...to God. The Third Secret of Fatima... ...has yet to be revealed. It could mean tragedy, or hope. But a prophecy is only a prophecy. I believe in humanity's future. This is because, while we live... ...we can change anything. Life is the light of hope. So whatever tragedy may come... ...humanity can overcome it. In that evolution I believe. So live. Whatever happens, do not despair. Didn't they stop to think there might be more than one clone? That's funny. Death! OK, guys. Today's the day. Give me a break, will you? Who are you? Who? Let's say, for instance... ...'the world', maybe? 'The world'? Yeah. And this world wants you gone. But the one thing you can't do is reverse time. Not without Solomon's Key. Jun, you'll get a tummy-ache. Shall we go? We won't be back. We fade to black, alas...
