No, not yet. I had to set up first. She's on her way to the house. Hey, I got this, okay? I'm doing it tonight. (doorbell ringing) I think she's here. I got to go. (phone beeps off) (doorbell rings) Come to me, come to me... Come to me, come to me Hey, baby. Mm... Come in. Hey, let's go upstairs, all right? Oh, I thought we were gonna go see New Moon. It's supposed to start... No. My parents are out. Let's just stay in, right? And look, I got you this. (laughs) What? (soft whooshing) Do you like it? I love it, it's beautiful. Thank you. Hey, you got your camera, right? Yeah... Good, because I want you to photograph me. Tonight, I will be your muse. (both laugh) Okay. (camera shutter clicking) You... are so beautiful. Do you love me? Yeah. There's something I need to tell you. Okay. I'm a nightwalker. Okay. What's a nightwalker? It's like a vampire. (scoffs) I'm just gonna show you something. Okay. (gasps) Hey, hey! I didn't choose to be like this. I-I don't know what you're talking about. I need to go. No. We chose you. Chose me? For what? The nightwalkers-- we chose you. Please just let me go. No, no, you are not gonna go. I love you. What are you talking about? Please, please. We can have this eternal bond, forever. I'm tired of killing. If I turn you, we could feed off each other forever. You're acting really crazy. Please just let me go. No! No... No, Pearl! Pearl, stop! (Pearl screams) Please, please, just leave me alone. Pearl! Get off of me! (grunting) It'll be better for the both of us. I don't understand what you want from me. Please, come on! Please, just let me go! You're the most important thing in the world to me! Come on! (shrieks) (grunting) Get back! (grunts) Ah! (Pearl grunts) (Pearl grunting) Ah! (panting) (choking) (whimpers quietly) I never meant... to hurt you. You're a nightwalker now. And you are gonna thirst... and kill... until you find your one true love. (gasping) (panting) (distant howling) (grunts) (groaning) (screams) (groaning, sobbing) (screaming) (screaming continues) (growls, hisses) (whispering voices) (sucking, gulping) (man whimpering) Oh, no. (panting) (indistinct chatter) MAN: Vampires and sexuality. Now, some argue that the insatiable thirst for blood, that makes vampires metaphorically sexual creatures. Bram Stoker: he takes vampires as a sex metaphor to a whole new level. He creates Dracula as a queer figure. So in contrast to Dracula, what sort of bond would Van Helsing have with his band of vampire hunters? Rodger? Heteronormative, yeah? At least, it seems that way. Right. So, their quest to end Dracula, it's also to reaffirm that their own homosocial bonds aren't queer. Violet? Okay, so then Dracula needed to be killed because of Victorian homophobia, but also because he was a murderer. Right. Yeah? MALE STUDENT: What about Twilight? (laughter) What about it? Well, the Twilight point of view is new, isn't it? I mean, it makes vampires good and-and cool. It makes everyone want to be a vampire. Do you want to be a vampire, Dan? (laughter) PROFESSOR: All right. The Twilight books suck. All right. They don't all suck. The first Twilight book was good, because it made teen sex dangerous again. Edward has to distance himself from Bella because of her blood and later, he won't have sex with her because he's afraid he'll get too excited and kill her. Interesting. I'd like to see where you're gonna go with this. In the past, teen sex was forbidden. A pregnancy out of wedlock was, like, death. But now, in our day, we have Teen Mom shows, and everyone can just use condoms. The first Twilight book was great because it equated teen sex with death again. And then they screwed it up in the later books, when he starts holding out just because he's a "Victorian gentleman." And then they actually get married as teens to have sex, which is just a way to cash in on teen sexuality while trying to seem morally responsible. It's absurd. Very interesting thoughts. You can all catch them, too, on Leah's podcast for pop culture. (laughter) So, please, join it. You know what? I think we're gonna end on that. Your next reading chapters will be listed in the syllabus. Be careful of vampires. Good-bye. Have a good day. (indistinct chatter) Hey, Leah! Leah, wait up! Oh, hey, Bob. Hey. Ready for auditions tonight? Oh, yeah. I'm a little nervous. Macbeth is tough. Yeah. You're gonna get Lady Macbeth. I mean, you're amazing. Thanks. So you ready for the, uh, country club Halloween party this year? My parents told me that your mom's been doing a lot of the planning? Yeah, she gets so into it. It's so embarrassing. (chuckles) Um, I'm gonna go study my lines, okay? Yeah, sure. Okay. I'll see you tonight? Yeah, yeah, yeah, of course. All right. Break a leg! (chuckles) Thanks. (bell tolling) BOB: And all our yesterdays have lighted fools the way to dusty death. Out! Out, brief candle! Life's but a walking shadow. A poor player that struts and frets his hour upon the stage and then is heard no more. It is a tale told by an idiot, full of sound and fury... signifying nothing. Great, Bob. Good job. I can tell you were working on that. Thank you. Thank you very much. Okay, thank you. Okay, is there, uh, is there anyone else for Macbeth? Leah. For-for Macbeth? Yeah, I would like to play Macbeth. Uh... Okay, fine with me. Give it a shot. Just like we practiced. Yeah. (clears throat) (deep breath) This'll be interesting. We will proceed no further in this business. He hath honored me of late and I have bought golden opinions from all sorts of people which would be worn now in their newest gloss, not cast aside so soon. I would... LEAH: Prithee, peace. I dare do all that may become a man. Who dare do more is none. If we should fail... And we shall not fail. Bring forth men children only. For thy undaunted metal should compose nothing but nails. Will it not be received when we have marked with blood those sleepy to of his own chamber and used their very daggers that they have done't? Who dares receive it other? I am settled and bend up each corporal agent to this terrible feat. Away. And mock the time with fairest show. May false face hide what the false heart doth know. (quietly): That was, um... (clears throat) That was something. Yes. All right, um... ladies, that was, uh, that was interesting. Uh, two Lady Macbeths. I like it. Okay, good job. And good job, everyone. I'll post the results later this week. Really good work. (indistinct chatter) (dog barking in distance) WOMAN: So, how's it going in there? Fine. You know, I miss you being around more than just on laundry day. Mom, come on, at least I'm close. I could have gone out of state. (gasps) And I'm just giving you a hard time. (laughs) Oh. I wanted to show the invitation. The invites went out this week. Looks good. I think it's gonna be even better than last year. You're gonna have a great time. You always do a great job. Oh, thanks, baby. So... how did the audition go? Good, I think. (sighs) Isn't Macbeth, like, one of the bloodiest plays? So what? So, I don't know. Are you sure you want to be around all of that? Mom, it's a play. William Shakespeare. They do it in elementary school. I know that. But not everyone has been through what you've been through. I'll be fine. Okay. So I was wondering if I can invite someone over for dinner on Friday night? Who? Um, just someone special I want you to meet. Leah? "Just someone special"? Of course, yes. That would be great. Don't make a big deal about it, okay? Who? Me? No, I... I got this. Baby (camera shutter clicking) Stop your chasing me Stop your staring, hungry eyes Give up your fantasy I'm not playing games... Is this okay? It is impossible for you to look bad. LEAH: I still want to do a shoot outside the studio at some point. Why, you don't like it here? No, just... you never leave. I like my cave. I want you to come to dinner at my mom's. Yes, Leah. LEAH: Please? It's time. I thought that you said that your mom was super conservative. Yeah. She is. And weird and crazy. Sometimes I wonder if she's my real mom. We're so different. But it's important to me. I just don't get why you care so much what she thinks. I don't care. But I don't want to hide anymore. Okay. (camera shutter clicking) (chuckles) I have something for you. It's beautiful. What did I do to deserve this? I just want to thank you for being my muse. (camera shutter clicking) I love posing for you. Good, 'cause I want to photograph you forever. (chuckles) (phone chimes) Oh, my God. What? I got Macbeth. Shut up. Yeah. (laughing) Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God! That's awesome. (laughs) Oh, my God. Oh, Bob's gonna be so pissed off. Who's Bob? Just this guy that has a crush on me. He got Macduff. Mm. Doesn't Macduff kill Macbeth? Yeah. Uh-huh. I guess he'll have the motivation. Man, don't worry about that play. We got that huge party tonight. It's gonna be sick. There's gonna be so many chicks there. Yeah... Oh, man, so many. Yeah, dude, like, at least, like, 50 people are coming to the party. Yeah, it's gonna be a huge kegger. Whoa, whoa. Hey, hey, hey, Bob, look, your girlfriend's outside. LEO: Oh, holy shit. Looks like you've been barking up the wrong tree, buddy. You guys shut the hell up. (chuckles) Enjoy the peeping, Bob. WOMAN: What's going on, Pearl? What do you mean? Seems like you and Leah are getting awfully close. I'm still gonna do it. Soon. It shouldn't be taking this long. Why are you spending so much time with her? Because I'm making sure she's willing. Better if it's quick. We don't want you having any second thoughts. I won't. She's almost ready, I just don't want her to have a bad turn. You still owe us. Yes, I know. Well, we're waiting. (door opens) LEAH: Hi! (door closes) Wonderful. First time she's on time in her whole life. Hi, hon. Hi, Mom. Are you early? (chuckles) Home cooking? Stop it. Raising you as a single mom most of your life didn't give me many opportunities for cooking lessons. You might want to put the oven on. (sighs) Great. Yeah. So what time is Bob coming? Bob...? That's who's coming to dinner, right? (doorbell rings) No, Mom, it's not Bob. Who is it? (door opens, closes) Mom... this is Pearl. Hi. Hey. Thank you for making dinner. Yeah, no problem. We have some of Mom's homemade pie later. You know, to be honest, I, um... I kind of thought Leah was bringing a boyfriend over tonight. Oh. Sorry. So, Pearl, what do you study? Um... Pearl's a photographer. Really? PEARL: Yeah. Yeah, she practically lives at the photo lab at school. It's my second home. (chuckling) Is that what you want to do or...? Yeah, it is. Wow. Mom. What? No, no, I... I think it's cute. You guys all want to be artists. (laughs) My parents were actually photographers. I'm sure they're very proud of you. Mm. They're gone... now, but... they were. Pearl, I'm sorry. That's... that's unfortunate. I'm sorry about that. No, it's... totally okay. It's fine, it happened a long time ago. Well, I'm sure Leah's told you about her dad. We're no strangers to loss. No, she didn't. He was murdered six years ago. It was in Florida, this psycho was on the loose with a gun, and it was Thanksgiving, and he went to the grocery store to get some last-minute things... ...and the guy came in and started shooting. I had no idea. I'm so sorry. That's why we moved to California. Right. Um, how about we lighten the mood? Why don't I, uh, go get that homemade pie I've been working so hard on and some coffee? Yeah? Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah, thank you. Be right back, girls. Are you okay? Yeah, I'll be fine. This is just so weird. You didn't tell her? Not really. LEAH: I'm so sorry I didn't tell you about my dad. I don't talk about it. PEARL: I get it. It's okay. Thank you. (insects trilling) PEARL: Well, you must be a pretty incredible woman to have raised a girl like Leah. Aw, thank you so much. Think I got pretty lucky. (chuckles) Thankfully, she's had so many great friends to help her out along the way. This is great. Now we can add you to that list, Pearl, right? (chuckles) You know, it's funny. Between us girls, I'm actually really nervous for the day that Leah brings home a boyfriend from college. (chuckles) LEAH: Mom? What? The reason I told you someone special was coming over is because... ...Pearl is special, to me. Pearl is my girlfriend. This is just news to me, you know? I, uh... I don't know. LEAH: I didn't know how to tell you. Yeah, you just did. Yeah. I'm sorry, I, uh, I'm just... I'm feeling a little tired, and I think this is just... just too much for me to handle right now. So, uh... Mom. Leah, please. Thank you for coming over. Thank you. Lovely. Thank you. Thank you for having me. Good night. WOMEN: Double, double, toil and trouble. Fire burn and cauldron bubble. Thrice the brinded cat hath mewed. Thrice and once the hedge-pig whined. Harpier cries, "'Tis time, 'tis time." Roundabout the cauldron goes. In the poison entrails throw. Toad, that under cold stone, days and nights has thirty-one. Sweltered venom sleeping got, boil thou first in the charmed pot. ALL: Double, double, toil and trouble. Fire burn and cauldron bubble. (rhythmic music plays) Fillet of a fenny snake. In the cauldron boil and bake. Eye of newt and toe of frog. Wool of bat and tongue of dog. Adder's fork and blind worm's sting. Lizard's leg and owlet's wing. For a charm of powerful trouble. Like a hell-broth, boil and bubble. Double, double, toil and trouble. Fire burn.... Double, double, toil and trouble. Fire burn and cauldron bubble. By the pricking of my thumbs, something wicked this way comes. Open, locks, whoever knocks. Like a hell-broth, boil and bubble. I did not direct that. (chuckles) (door opening) (indistinct chatter) Leah. Hey. What are you still doing here? (laughs nervously) Can I walk you home? No, I'm going to meet someone. I can't catch a break. What do you mean? What do I have to do, Leah? You don't have to do anything. It's not about you. Well, what is it? Just tell me. I'm in love with someone. Who? Is it that girl? What? I saw you kissing a girl outside of your dorm. D-do you like women? Have you been following me? No, I'm not following you. Oh, you're a creep. Hey, Leah! Get off. (wind blowing) SHIRKE: How's our little newbie doing? PEARL: (exhales) I'm fine. Still taking your little photos? Yes. We're going hunting tomorrow. Be ready. PEARL: Mm-kay. You're hungry, aren't you? Yes. Good. (wind blowing) (keypad beeping) (line ringing) (phone buzzing) (phone beeps) Hello? BOB: Uh, hi, Ms. Lewisson? Yes? Hi, this is, uh, Bob Segal. Oh, Bob. Hi. What can I do for you? Um... Well, this is hard to say. It's about Leah. Oh, no. Is this about that girl? Oh, you know? What, that Leah has a girlfriend? Yeah, I do. But is... what is it? Is something wrong with her? Well, she's bad news, Ms. Lewisson. She's part of a bad crowd. Like what? Bob, is my daughter in danger? Yeah, yeah. I'm in the play with a few of her friends. They seem like they're in some really sketchy stuff. Sketchy? Like what? I mean, they must be into drugs or something. She's really scaring me. My God. Okay, Bob, thank you very much for telling me. I have to go. Okay. MS. LEWISSON: Leah. Leah! Yeah? What the hell is going on? What are you talking about? Are you okay? No, I'm not okay. You need to get away from Pearl, now. Leah, this isn't right. What's not right? That I care about her? I know what is going on. I know that she's bringing you into this whole new world of trouble. Mom, you don't know crap. Can you just stay out of my business? You are my business. And I won't have you pulled into some crazy shit! Okay, Mom. Go screw yourself. I don't even know why I tried to tell you about any of this in the first place. Leah... (door closes) (insects trilling) (phone beeps) (line ringing) (sighs) Come on. MAN: Hello? Hello. Uh, Professor Cardin? Yes, this is he. Hi, my name is Julie Lewisson. And, uh, I'm actually calling regarding one of your students. Okay. I know this might sound weird, but I... I just recently saw her work and I was actually hoping to buy some of her photography. Oh, that's great. Yeah. It's beautiful. Um... Pearl Thompson. Uh, I don't have any student by that name. Could she be listed under a different name? Um... no, I'm-I'm... I'm sure she's a student there. She practically lives in the lab. No, I'm sorry. She's not a student here. Are you sure? I'm absolutely sure. Is there anything else I can help you with? No, I'm... I guess it was just my mistake. Okay, uh... thank you for your time, Professor. Oh, no problem. Good night. Good night. The monster is often used in horror films and literature to portray the "other." The queer. The queer that needs reforming. Oh, my child Oh, my child Oh, my child Oh, my child The monster's victims are not really victims, but are hyper-exaggerated examples of virile, misguided heterosexuality. (chatter, laughter) These monster characters, the "other," are often excluded from society. He/she/it are ostracized, alone. Oh, my child Oh, my child Oh, my child Oh, my child No. (grunts) Oh, my God... (groans) (grunts) ROSS: And so these monster stories serve as homosexual metaphors, with the monster character portraying the "other"... (whimpers) ...the queer symbol. (whimpers) (slurps) What the...? (grunts) (hissing) Shh. Looks like it was getting real romantic. Yeah, real Casanova. Oh... look at him. Oh, he has to go for drunk girls. Yeah... What's that all about, huh? Oh, you're so cute. (indistinct murmuring) He looks so sad. Mmm... Why are you so sad? (muffled breathing) You really want to kill yourself? Oh, I'd hate myself, too, if I were you. (muffled screaming) Ah, we wouldn't want another college suicide. (laughter) Oh... (muffled scream) (sighs) Oh, please... stop. Stop, stop... (party music playing) GIRL: Mandy? Come on. Let's go. Mandy? Where is she? (girl screaming) (screams echoing) (door closes) (metal clangs) LEAH: Come, ceiling night. Scarf out the tender eye of pitiful day and with thy bloody and invisible hand, cancel and tear to pieces that great bond which keeps me pale. Light thickens and the crow makes wing to th' rooky wood. Good things of day begin to droop and drowse. While night's black agents to their preys do rouse. (panting, moaning) (door opens) Mom... (door closes) I'm so sorry I missed dinner. Rehearsal went super late. Were you with Pearl? No, I was at rehearsal. You can't see her anymore. What are you talking about? I forbid you to see her again. Why? Because she's a woman? No, because she is dangerous. Are you serious? You don't even know her. And I don't think you know her, either. I know her enough to know that I love her. Leah, if you see her again, I will stop paying for your school! You know what? You're just sad. Bitch. (door closes) Call me blind Call me stupid Call me anything that you want But I feel like something good is gonna come... (both laughing) When I'm high When I'm loving When I'm starting to sing this song Well, I feel like something good Is gonna come... (chuckles) Feel it flowing As it starts to take you over Like the heat of the sun... Yeah, I feel like something good Is on the way And I know that someone somewhere Feels the same way Yeah, I feel like something good Is on the way And I know that someone Somewhere feels the same Won't you play a game with me? Hi, Pearl. Hi. Where have you been? SONTE: She's been busy falling in love. Where's your girlfriend? SHIRKE: You did turn her, right? No, I didn't. You're not actually falling in love, are you? No. Then what's taking so long? She's waiting to turn her one true love. Is that what you're planning? No, it is not my plan. I'm going to do it tonight. Okay? I will do it tonight. Don't let us down. (laughs) What do you think? You look perfect. If you say so. You're the photographer. Come on. (laughs) (indistinct chatter) (both laughing) (heart beating rapidly) (panting) Are you okay? Leah, I haven't been completely honest with you about myself. Just tell me. Just-- I-I can't. You're not gonna believe me. You're gonna think I'm crazy. Tell me. I am a nightwalker. What does that mean? I live off of blood. I kill people for that blood. I don't really understand. I... am a vampire, like in the movies. I try to only go after abusive men. I try to make it okay, but look... (gasps) I'm sorry, Leah. I wanted to tell you, but I just didn't think you'd believe me. And I understand if you don't ever want to see me again. I just... This is insane! I know. I'm sorry, I'm so... Wha... what? I'm sorry, Leah. I... I-I-I can't be here right now. What the hell are you doing?! I didn't do it, okay? It was forced on me, remember? I'm not gonna do that to Leah. She's not gonna do it. She better do it. Or I will! (bell tolling) "Morning and evening, maids heard the goblins cry. "'Come buy our orchard fruits. "Come buy, come buy.' "She cried, 'Laura up in the garden, did you miss me? "'Come and kiss me, never mind my bruises. "'Hug me, kiss me, "'suck my juices. "'Squeezed from goblin fruits, "'for you, goblin pulp and goblin dew. "'Eat me, drink me, love me, "thirst me.' "Cankered, goblin ridden, "she clung about her sister. "Kissed and kissed and kissed her. "Tears once again refreshed her shrunken eyes. "Dropping like rain after a long, sultry drought. "Shaking with anguish, fear and pain, she kissed and kissed her with a hungry mouth." "The Goblin Market." Such an interesting one, because it serves as a double metaphor. Leah? Isn't that right, Leah? Will you care to expand? Well, it's about... virginity and impurity, represented by Laura's giving in to the goblins' seduction. Tasting their forbidden fruit. Yeah. But it's also about the bonds of women. Lizzie's love for Laura was so strong that, ultimately, in the end, it saved her from her demise. (phone line ringing) Hey. Um... I've been thinking, and I want to see you. I want to talk. Okay. Yeah, I can meet you there. Okay. Okay, see you tonight. LEAH: Thou sure and firm-set earth, hear not my steps, which way they walk, for fear thy very stones prate of my whereabouts. And take the present horror from the time which now suits with it. While I threat, he lives. Words to the heat of deeds too cold breath gives. Bell. LEAH: I go, and it is done. The bell invites me. For it is a knell that summons thee to heaven or to hell. (screaming) (panting) Uh... (clears throat) Great, okay. Good job. That was amazing. You should probably get cleaned up. Hey. Thanks for coming here. Yeah, why are we here? I just come here sometimes. It's kind of private. I'm sure it is. (sighs) Leah, I'm so sorry. Don't apologize. You can't help who you are, right? No. Maybe this doesn't make any sense... but... I still love you. You do? Yeah. Of course. You're still you. I love you. Lie down Lie my truth in you And it's too late for me to turn Turn the tracks of these memories I've spent my whole life Wishing it was you... What's it like... ...being a nightwalker? PEARL: Most of the time, it's torture. LEAH: Why? I always thirst. And, um, I try to resist it, but... most of the time, I give in. LEAH: How many? PEARL: I don't know. Probably, like, eight. They're all bad people, but none of them deserved to die. LEAH: Maybe they did. No, they didn't. I don't want to do this anymore. LEAH: Then what can you do? PEARL: I don't know. Maybe I'll just lock myself in a room or something. LEAH: And die? PEARL: Maybe. Maybe that's what I deserve. LEAH: Is there any other way? Yeah, there's another way. LEAH: What? PEARL: I don't want to tell you. Tell me. I want to know. PEARL: If a nightwalker finds their one true love, and then they can turn them, and then they can live off of each other forever. They call it an eternal bond. Then I want you to make me a nightwalker, Pearl. No. Why not? Don't you love me? Yes. I do love you. That is exactly why I can't do that to you. But I want you to. If it means that we can be together, if it means that I can help you. No. I don't want you to suffer anymore. All it means is that you suffer, too. You are in danger. I have put you in danger. You cannot trust me. They made me pick you just to turn you, but then I fell in love with you, and I don't want to... There are others? Yes. (sobs softly) Leah, I'm sorry. I put you in danger. You need to get out of here. If you stay around, they're just gonna turn you. Then you turn me. No. You just need to get out of here. You don't want to be around me. (growling) Leah, you have to go. You have to get... you have to go, now! What? Why? Pearl, why? Pearl, I'm not leaving. I'm not. I'm not leaving you... Leah, go. Just go! Hey, baby. How's it going? Fine. Tonight's gonna be a lot of fun. I'm really happy you're coming with me. You'd probably be obsessing over where I was if I didn't. You know I only want the best for you, right? Yeah, I believe you; I just don't think you know what's best for me. I'm gonna finish getting ready. We should leave soon, okay? Say good-bye To the life That you knew (crowd chattering) Say hello To the war You've been dreaming Say good-bye It's all waiting For you Keep in mind when you go Where you're aiming At the place Where you feel most alive Say good-bye To the life That you knew Say hello To the dreams you're concealing... Hey, Leah! Hey. Do you want a drink? Uh, yeah, okay. Okay. It's a great party, huh? Your mom must be happy. LEAH: Yeah, she is. You can follow what you've been feeling... Look, I just want to apologize for the way I've acted. It's fine. No, I-I mean it, all right? I've-I've been an idiot, all right? It's like, "Get a clue, Bob," right? (chuckles) Don't worry, Bob. It's fine. I just want you to be happy, Leah. Thank you. I like your outfit, by the way. Huh? Dracula, huh? A little clich, huh? (growls) You know? Dracula. Yeah. So misunderstood. (chuckles) Yeah? Hey, Pearl. So happy you're here. Hey! You look so beautiful. Oh, I missed you so much. 'Cause no one does it better than you Than you And it feels so good And it feels so much better with you 'Cause no one does it better Than you No one does it better than you 'Cause no one does it better than you (distorting and fading): Than you (people laughing) (cackling) (distorted, indistinct conversations) (distorted whispering) (distorted): Leah? Leah! You okay? (distorted whispering) (distorted voices) Leah. Leah! BOB: Leah. Leah! Leah! Hey! Leah! Hey, Leah. Relax, okay? It's okay. Let's go get some fresh air. Nice spot. It's okay. Hey, you're all right. Come here. (music continues in distance) Okay. You know what? Here. No, no, come on, come on. Let's sit down right here. Right here. Let's sit here. Feel like... There you go. (shallow breathing) Yeah, feel better? (deep breaths) Okay. Yeah, let's see. Let's just take this off, huh? Huh? How's that? Yeah? A little better? Yeah? Huh? How's that? Yeah? Little better? Yeah? (kissing) (grunting weakly) (Leah groans) (whimpers) (growling) (screams) Oh, sh... oh, God! No, n-n-n-no. Ah, God! (gasping, sobbing) (coughing) (screaming) (hisses) MS. LEWISSON: Leah! Leah, where are you? (shallow gasping) Leah! Oh, my God! Help! Somebody help! God. Leah! Oh, my God! Help! Somebody help us! Oh, baby. Oh, God. TODD: Julie, what's going on?! Leah's been attacked! (crying): Baby. Leah, please. Help! I don't know if she's breathing. No, no. Oh, my God. I don't know what to do! Oh, my God. (birds chirping) (groans) (footsteps approaching) Hi, baby. Mom. Oh, baby. How are you feeling? (exhales) Not good. I think Bob drugged me. Bob? Leah, are you sure? Yeah. Yeah, it was definitely him. (exhales) Baby, Bob's been missing since last night. Something happened to him, too. He's gone? Yeah, he is. It's okay, baby. Look, I think you just need to-to rest. You've been through a lot, okay? Oh, my God, it's my opening night. Yeah, Leah, you're not going to that, okay? I have to. After what you've just experienced? Absolutely not. You can't just protect me my whole life and hide things from me just because of what happened with Dad. Bad things happen to good people either way. Okay, okay, calm down. (sighs heavily) You're right. Let me just drive you to the theater, okay? Yeah, thanks. Okay. I love you. (phone beeps) (line ringing) (line beeps) Pearl, where are you? I-I don't know what happened last night. I really hope you come tonight. Bye. (wolf howls) Hi. Hey. You guys weren't at the country club party last night, were you? No. We're not members at such a fancy place. Oh. My mistake. (chuckles softly) Have a good show. (snapping fingers) (rhythmic slapping) (rapid stomping) ALL: What a to-do to die today at a minute or two to 2:00. A thing distinctly hard to say but harder still to do.

A thing distinctly hard to say but harder still to do. What a to-do to die today at a minute or two to 2:00. A thing distinctly hard to say but harder still to do. Okay. (applause, chuckling) (cheering) All right, you've worked really hard on this. I've never seen a production of Macbeth quite like this. Oh, I shouldn't say the name. That's bad luck, but... I think we'll be all right. YOUNG WOMAN: Oh, my God, it's Bob. Bob. Uh, are you okay? Where were you? I'm here now. Okay. All right. Come on. Everyone in. Everyone in. (indistinct chatter) (heart beating) And... ALL: Oogah boogah! Oogah boogah! Oogah boogah! (applause, cheering) YOUNG MAN: Yeah! Please 't Your Highness to grace us with your royal company? The table's full. But here is a place reserved. Where?! Which of you have done this?! (panting) LENNOX: What, my good lady? (panting) Thou canst not say I did it. Never shake thy gory locks at me. (panting) Gentlemen, rise. Her Highness is not well. LENNOX (muffled): But, peace. For from broad words and 'cause he failed his presence at the tyrant's feast, I hear Macduff lives in disgrace. Sir, can you tell where he bestows himself? (panting) (applause) (crickets chirping) Out, damned spot! Out, I say! One, two. Why, then, 'tis time to do 't. Hell is murky. Fie, my lord, fie. A soldier, and afeard? What need we fear... Did you have fun at the Halloween party? ...our power to account? You gave me something. Mm. Focus. We have our big scene coming up. The one where I kill you. (panting) (panting) (wolf howls) Turn, hellhound, turn! Get thee back. (chuckles) My soul is too much charged with the blood of thine already. I have no words. My voice is in my sword. Thou bloodier villain than terms can give thee out! (both shouting, grunting) (panting) (gasps) (panting, growls) (shouting) (panting) (shouting) (grunting) (laughs) Oh... I always liked you, Leah. But you... had to make things so difficult. (whispers): Bob... what are you doing? We could've been together. (whispers): What are they doing? BOB: But you... had to go... and be a freak. (giggles) (cackles) (hissing) I'm gonna turn you into a nightwalker, bitch! (laughs) (shrieks) Leah! (sword clatters) Where are you going? Hey! Um... Uh, thanks for coming, everyone. Uh, that's uh, Macbeth. (panting) Oh! No... no, no, please, please. (cackling) (whimpering): No. Stop! Guys! BOB: Oh, shh, shh. (sobbing): I can't... I've been waiting for this for a long time, Leah. (laughs) Please! MS. LEWISSON: Get off of her! Mom! No! Mom's here. Mom! Mom! (cackles) (growling) Mom, no! Run! (grunts) Bob, what are you gonna do?! No! Bob... What's he gonna do? What's he gonna do? Don't worry, it'll all be over very soon. Please, please. (screaming) (growls) Help! Mom!

(sobbing continues) Heaven help us now We're being engulfed somehow The flames rise higher Over us Dark star up above I never felt so in love You and me, babe There's no way out Will you save me Pretty baby (sobbing) Dry your eyes... You have to do it. Pearl, please. It's the only way. Leah, I can still protect you and wa... No. No, I want to be with you. I want to be with you, too. Then give it to me. Eternity. Okay. Here, lay down. Like this? Yeah. Does it hurt? Yeah. But it'll be over in a few minutes, and I'll be here the whole time. Okay? (sniffles) Here, I have you. (screaming) Will you save me Pretty baby (crunching) (screaming) Dry your eyes We don't have to run Will you save me (whooshing) Pretty baby Drifting through the night Go on and on Will you save me...
