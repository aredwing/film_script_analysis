There were 1189 dead and almost a million refugees... If you're called, take your luggage. To Damascus? - They're all here? - Except numbers 75, 76, 77. All the others are here. UNDER THE BOMBS To Damascus? I want to go to the South. - Anyone going south? - No. Tyre, Saida... The South! Kherbet Selm? - Going to the South? - Tyre, Saida, Kherbet Selm. Damascus... at the Syrian-Lebanese border... South? - No one will take you there. - No one? No one will take you there. To Damascus no problem. Anyone going south? Please, a taxi for the South! - No one will go. - Too dangerous. The road's blocked. No one will go. - Where to? - Saida, Tyre, Kherbet Selm... - In the South? - Yes. - I'll take you. - You'll take me? OK, I'll take her. How long? Who knows! An hour, two hours, a day, two days... - Or never. - I must get there. Mind your hand. How much? - Let's get there first. Then we'll see. - I need to know. Any idea what it's like in the South? The war might be over, but hell could start again anytime. How much? For those... For those beautiful eyes... Lady, I'm not risking my life for nothing. Find someone else. Khalil... What's your name? Tony. OK Tony, let's make a deal. I'll pay you half now, and half when we get there. To whom do I have the pleasure? Delighted! The 8 o'clock News on Radio Lebanon. Thank you for listening. The headlines - Thousands of refugees are returning following the ceasefire. Israel says the situation in the area is fragile and is keeping control of the port and airport. People are advised to look out for booby-traps. So you're from the South, Madam? You don't look it. And what do southerners look like? - I didn't mean... - Rita? - I just got here. - Poor damaged South! I didn't want to disturb you. I took a taxi. Via Turkey. The Israeli blockade, it's hell. No. He's still in Hong-Kong. Yes, for his stupid shopping centre. If she calls let me know straight away. Of course, I'll keep trying. Yes, yes. Me too. Hopefully. You came through Turkey? You're always that nosy? We're in the same car. It's normal. Anyway, if I can be of help let me know. I know everyone here. My son. I've had no news from him for a week. My sister told me they'd be in Saida or Tyre. Saida? I know it like the back of my hand! Let's start with the schools. The refugees are there. We'll find them. Don't worry, Madam. There's another road. It's further, but we'll get there. I have an errand to run. I'll be back soon. Their names aren't on the list. Doesn't prove anything, though. Things change all the time. They might be here, without being listed. - They could've gone back? - Sure. Let's try asking people from the same village. A boy who looks like you. His name's Karim. - He's six. Have you seen him? - No. I've come from Dubai. I'm looking for my son and sister. They were in Kherbet Selm. They put people up in the schools. - In Saida? - Yes. At the hospital in Tebnine, too. Or near Rmeich. They took the border people there. Good morning. I'm looking for my sister and son. From Kherbet Selm. Have you heard of them? I wish we did. I'm looking for my children too. We've heard nothing. - Why are you crying? - My son and his wife... They're dead. I want to see my children. One of them at least, to tell me where the others are. Good morning! What's all this? Aid for the South? Yes, we're taking it there. You're going to fill up the truck? Aid parcels only? - What's your son's name? - Omar. God bless your son, Abou Omar. My cousin has two daughters. One is dead... In the fighting? The other lost a leg... They have no medicine in the South. Can you give me some? The Foundation will give you some. I'm in a hurry. We could put a couple of boxes in the boot. - Aren't you in charge? - Exactly. To make sure it all gets there. - It's your lorry? - Yes. So you could give me two boxes? It's for helpless refugees. - Abou Omar... Come on! - Impossible. COURT OF JUSTICE I'm Zeina Noureddine. Is there a Maha Noureddine on the list and a boy, Karim? - Yes, there is. - They're here? They say that my sister Maha from Kherbet Selm was here? I did see a redhead, she was downstairs. Yes, that's right, curly red hair! - Where? - Downstairs, with a small boy. - A small boy? - I saw her, she was downstairs. - When? - Since we first got here. - She's like this? - No, that's not her. I must find them. It's my son and sister. He's very young! - Can anyone help me? - No one can. You can even forget your own children. I left mine behind to get into a van. We were 15. I took two kids and left the others in a garage. - You left them behind? - Yes! When we went back to the village, they were all dead. Under the rubble, we found my husband, his brother, his wife and four children. My cousin, shot down outside. Eleven people. That's life. That's what Israel wants. They were aiming at people. Women, children... Anywhere with civilians. My cousin, they blew her up on her doorstep. She left a daughter. Taghrid told her, "Maryam, you're dying?" She said, "The 150 thousand pounds in my pocket, "give them to my daughter. " She was dying, poor thing. She said, "The money's for my daughter", then she died. What do we get out of it? The houses, we can rebuild, but all the lost souls? They don't come back. God bless you. God willing, you'll find them safe and sound. You're back? No, not yet. I'm looking everywhere in vain. My sister, her phone's been dead for a week. How would you get here? It's been a nightmare. You mean, "You want to be with your son, not with me. " Well, I have to go. Bye. That's your "small errand"? - I've looked for you everywhere... - Where were you? - Did you find them? - Why did you disappear? What do you want to do? They told me about a convent, with refugees. - Where is that convent? - In Marjeyoun. According to the Israeli Army, Hezbollah fighters launched about ten rockets today on Israeli positions in the South. There are no casualties... You're singing? How can you sing and laugh? I have to get there! We'll get there, Madam. - Calm down! - Hands off! I'm warning you, if something's happened to them... God help you! We'll get there, Madam, trust me. Do you know Marjeyoun? It's not exactly next door. I thought we were sticking to the coast road. It was clear. But if we have to go up to Marjeyoun, why not? What do you mean? I know the area well. I come from there. Winding roads, potholes... And the war hasn't improved things. More petrol, more time... It's not that simple! We made a deal for a day. Yes, for Saida and Tyre. Not for other places. I'm telling you in case I need... to ask for a supplement. One minute you disappear, the next you want extra... - It's going to last long? - 50 dollars. No more. Better safe... And if we need to go anywhere else? For that price? I'll take you to the moon. The civil defence are recovering bodies from under the rubble in the villages of Sifra and Halloussie. More than 50 bodies could still be buried under the devastation. Would you care for some music? I have some Fayrouz, Wadih Safi or Oum Koulsoum... I even have some Boney M. It's good Boney M. Is it extra? No, it's part of the package! Sorry Madam, it's an old cassette. That's where I'd like to go. When I get some money. I have a plan with my brother. To open an oriental restaurant. The Germans will love it. They find our food exotic! I'll be gone ten minutes, no more. You'll find me easily. Ask for Tony, everybody knows me here. Tony! If I lose you, I won't know where to go. You're not going to lose me, Madam, you won't. They went without warning. We didn't expect it. They left. Right after the ceasefire. They were just waiting on the doorstep, ready to get back home. - Tell me about Joseph. - He wants to come back. And end up in prison because of fucking politics. Listen... Prison, I know. Homesickness drove me back. Bloody homesickness! You say that because you don't know. - He talked about me? - All the time. He misses you. And the twins? Bless them! They are ten and at primary school. They speak Hebrew as if they were born there. Jews and us, we're the same. Same look, same face... same mould. Shopkeepers like us, only richer. Ten years old! How long is it since you've seen your village? Ten years. You're afraid of going back? They are still recovering bodies from the rubble and clearing the southern suburbs and many places in the South. The Lebanese Red Cross recovered 16 bodies in Taibe and Adaisse. It's my aunt's house. They are martyrs - Hussein Nasrallah, Nazha Nasrallah... Is this what's left of it? Kacem Hazouri, Ali Souli, Hanu Marmar and his wife Fatme, Mhamed Karim, their daughter Aya. It's that way! Up there, on the right. Here! A bomb has also gone off in Zaltar-West, killing one person, Ali Khalil Turkiya, whose body was transported to hospital in Nabatiy. The army announced this morning that military units are still counting the unexploded munitions left behind by the Israeli army... No... No, they weren't inside. Dear Lord... Tell me they weren't in. Maha! Karim! Dear Lord, tell me they weren't inside! Who are you looking for? - I'm Maha's sister. - Her sister? She was inside? Answer me! - Was she inside? - You have to be strong. Your sister's a martyr. She's in paradise. Don't be afraid. Don't cry. In paradise? Don't cry. Be proud of her. And my son, Karim? Was he with her? - He's your son? - Yes! You've seen him? - He's safe. - Is it true? You've seen him? - Karim is your son? - Yes. Karim looks like you. We played together. Journalists took him. Where to? - What's your name? - Ali. - Where's Karim? - With the journalists. - Which journalists? - French. Tell me the truth Ali. - Where did they take him? - To Tyre. Where in Tyre? You're sure? Did you see him with your own eyes? Is he alive? Your son's alive. Calm down. Don't cry. Maha, my dear Maha! - Maha, my darling. - Calm down. Maha, my darling Maha. Why you, why? She wasn't the only one. You were so peace loving! If only I'd been with you! Where are you taking me? Where are we going? Where is my sister? I left without finding out? And my son? Where is he? With the French, but where? I know about my sister. But my son? We drove on without finding out. You know nothing! You don't care. All you care about is your 50 dollars! Now you've got your money! The day's over, you can go. It's OK, you can go! That's it? You've destroyed the bridges. We have mended their hearts. Hezbollah Good afternoon. - Miss Zeinab, how are you? - Fine. - Can I come? - Yes. - No cluster bombs? - No. - Are you sure? - Just walk normally. That's the way I walk. Hello, how are you? Well, any news? Everything's all right? - You recognise me? - Yes. You're the taxi driver? - It's your house? - All my family lived there. Now, there's no one left. My uncle lived here. There, that's our flat. That's my room, there. A broken vase, even stuck back, it still shows. Yes, the hatred keeps growing. What's happened? The poor woman is distraught. Where is her sister's body? No one is buried here because of the air strikes. - But where are they? - In a communal grave, in Tyre. The ambulance took her. - You're sure? - Provisionally to Tyre. - Where exactly? - Near the barracks. Some people come to recover the bodies. To bury them again. Really? Are you interested? I have some. I have a box of tranquillisers. - You give it to us? - Yes... Aid or... Almost aid. At cost price. How are you, Ali? Tell me, how old are you? Eleven. You've seen all the war? Two wars. I've seen two wars. You saw two wars? - Which ones? - 1996 and 2006. How old were you in 1996? - Three months. - Really. Which one was the hardest? - This one, by far. - Why? It lasted 33 days, the other only 16. Tell me what happened. With Karim, we hid in this shelter. For more than three days, the bombing didn't stop. Karim was very sad because his aunt was dead. He asked me once, "'When will she be back?" I said, "Come on, we'll play with Tarek. " So he'd forget his aunt and stop crying. - Were you afraid? - Yes. Tarek was coughing because of the dust. - It was everywhere. - Who's Tarek? He's dead. He was Karim's age. They were always together. There was so much dust that he was coughing and choking. His mother decided to go and get it. - Get what? - The asthma medicine. He went with her, he didn't want to stay alone. Just then we heard a great bang. It was the building. People were screaming, "We'll be buried alive. " And Karim? He wanted to bring Tarek back, he only had him. I ran after him, to hold him back but he disappeared in the smoke of the bombs. And the cars came. - Which cars? - The ambulances. There were two ambulances, a Jeep from the TV, a car and a van. - He went into the Jeep. - You saw him? I saw him in the middle of the smoke. A man almost tore the jacket his father bought him in America. - Which man? - One of the French journalists. Where did they go? There were so many bombs they went in all directions. That's Tarek's house. Poor Tarek, that's where he died. It's not five star, but it's OK. I've brought clients before. I hope they have some rooms left. Good evening. I'd like two rooms. The best you've got. It's for the Lady. She's had a long trip. - You pay in advance. - You pay in advance. How much? - How much? - A hundred. If you don't mind... could you pay me for the day as agreed? We said, "per day", didn't we? Here you are, you pay. It's our best room. ...breach of the ceasefire, Israeli commandos have attacked Hezbollah positions in East Lebanon. An Israeli officer was killed. Several people were injured... They start again after the ceasefire? They respect nothing, the bastards! Three Shiite fighters were killed in the attack. The Lebanese Prime Minister has lodged a complaint with the representative of the United Nations in Beirut wondering how the Israeli army would react if the Hezbollah had been behind the attack. - They're going to bomb us again? - For sure! It's silly to poke a wasps' nest! I won't be able to sleep. Not until I find Karim. And to think I'd taken the house keys! And the door, that's all that's left! Poor Maha. Two days under the rubble, can you imagine! She loved that house. After our parents died, she moved in. She used to say, "Karim must live here... "like us, when we were kids. " What made me send him here? Karim's alive, that's important. Imagine what he's been through. Don't worry, I'm going to bed. Me too. I'll call you tomorrow. Sorry... I'd like to apologise... for... the 50 dollars. I'm not... Usually, I'm not like this... But some clients are real bastards. I've been conned before. I'm not a bastard, sorry. Usually, I'm... It's cold. Good night, Tony. You too... Madam. "Excuse me, Madam... "You give me 50 dollars?" Very classy! In your vest and shorts! That's the way you're going to get her? I brought you a pillow. Thank you, I'd forgotten. What's the matter? Anything wrong? I'm scared. The noise of the wind reminds me of the planes. You want to come in? There's no wind in here. Come in. Shy? No! No! What's the matter? Karim's dead. He was looking at me. His eyes were wide open. He was frozen. He's dead. Calm down. It was a nightmare. I was holding him in my arms. I was dead too. They wanted to take him away, wrench him out of my arms. They took him to lay him in a coffin. They took him away. Calm down, it'll be daylight soon. They could have put us together. Why separate us? Why wasn't I there when the bombs were falling? Drink. You must sleep. You have to be strong for tomorrow. Do you think I'm chasing a shadow? That's his picture. We have records. We have lists. We are watching everything. You can be sure we'll take all necessary measures. We'll do our best. Tomorrow the first French soldiers will be here. It's the kind of event that attracts journalists. Your journalist might be there. - And you, where are you from? - Me? From Qlaiaa. - In the South? - Yes. - We're all children of the South. - Welcome. Yes, children of the same country. God bless you. We're going to do everything we can. As soon as we hear anything we'll tell you. - Do you know him? - No, why? Just an impression... He knows where I'm from. I know where he's from. He can get stuffed! Don't get too close. Don't touch. Inform. Qlaiaa is an SLA stronghold. He's more likely to enquire about me. Were you in the South Lebanon Army? We've got to fill up. Not me. My brother. I'll be back in ten minutes. Ready-to-wear "Promises held" Hello! I have "Fatme Majed" here. From Kherbet Selm. There are some unidentified bodies. Maha! Maha Noureddine. Where do I ask? Who's got the names? Ask the doctor, he's got the names. Maha Noureddine. You have the list? Maha Noureddine? She was sent to Kherbet Selm. - Where? - To Canaa. Canaa can bury its dead. It took 19 days for the people of the small Lebanese town to be able to organise the funeral of their victims. The 29 civilians, mainly women and children, killed during the Israeli air strike on 30 July were buried today during funerals, where the flags of Lebanon and of the Hezbollah were flying. The tragic episode of the war between Israel and the Hezbollah, was condemned unanimously in the world. Once the uncertainty about the number of victims and the attempts at recuperation are over, it will finally lead to peace. Israel, Israel, The enemy of the Muslims... America, America, the world's great Satan... When you call us, Prophet Hussein, we answer "Present"! - Who are you? - Hezbollah! - Your leader? - Nasrallah! Let them bury her themselves. They didn't ask her opinion. Nor mine either. Even for this war. No, it's not my war! It's not yours, Maha. Do we have a right to live? To live! Is that too much to ask? It's not your war, Maha. Forgive me, sister. I wasn't with you. I can understand you. I can understand you so well. I also lost someone very dear to me. Remember when you use to cover for me? You followed me in the car and hooted? You went alone, quietly. Without hooting. I'll miss you, Maha, I'll miss you a lot. What do you want to do? I want to find my son. We'll find him. I won't leave you until we find him, all right? Where do you want to go? To the hotel, I forgot my address book. A bit of German? - You know Germany? - I wish I did! Only its postcards. My uncle's there, waiting for my brother and me. I went there three times. You did? Is it nice? The country, yes. But I was bored. I went with my husband to conferences on architecture. The buffets were terrible! All meat! And I'm a vegetarian! My uncle's in sausages. He stuffs all day! All this talk's making me hungry. I can't wait to get there. What's stopping you? I asked for my passport eight months ago. To join your collaborator of a brother? To join him in Israel, that's it? You know the charges against him? It's no use saying I haven't seen him for six years. To calm him down... Stop hooting, stupid bastard! For me, it's the opposite. When I was in Dubai, I only wanted to come back. The only time I felt at home, was when I planted an olive tree from Lebanon. My brother says, "Nothing's worse than exile. " But how can I bring up my son here? With all this hatred around! We've known nothing but war! In another ten years it might start again! Ten years? You're very optimistic. We're that close to a world war. What do you think? I don't care about the world war! I want to find my son. Anything new? Did the picture help? The journalists register with you, don't they? Where can I find them? OK, tomorrow, in Naquoura. They'll all be there? - Is this a taxi? - Not any more. My old legs won't carry me any more. My house isn't far. Can you take me there? Get in. I came to pick some figs. Our figs are well known in the region. Come on, have one. Where can we find a petrol station? There's one ahead. They're lovely, taste one! When there are no planes, we come out to pick the figs. When the fighting starts, we hide in the caves. - We're lucky to have the caves. - Where's that station? My house is on that little road. I'll show you. We're almost there. The station is that way? - On that road? - Yes. They always have petrol. That's my house. I was born here. I live here. I'll die here. And you, my girl, don't worry. The land shakes but doesn't fall. And you, my friend, you carry on straight on that road. Tell them that Abou Salem sent you and they'll give you petrol. Go on, God bless you. Look, it's really packed! Let me handle it, I'll make a deal. Hello! Anybody here? Abou Salem sent us. We'd like some petrol! Well, how are you? I need a little petrol. Just a drop to drive out of this hole. This hole... Please. You want petrol? Abou Salem sent you? Then you're welcome. - Do you a have a jerrycan? - Yes. Bring it over. The jerrycan! I'll give you some from here. You don't believe me? You should've seen it before! It was the most beautiful station. That's why they hit it. My son sent me money from Africa. And I built. "What do you do with it all?" He'd ask. I'd say, "You come and see. " Do you have children? - A son. - God bless him. Him and all the world's children. A week ago, Abou Ahmad came to take some petrol. I told him, "Leave some for others. " Go on... Can I help you? Be my guest. God is great. My son will send me money and I'll rebuild it. A son, it's a great help! God is great. When you come back, it will be even more beautiful than before. My son is lost. Everybody's looking for him. All this terror, these bombsl The madness of some... It doesn't matter, we must search. Many have died. It doesn't matter. Everything can wait, we must search. My son is lost. What did he do wrong? We have to fight back. It's not important. First we must search. Then we'll resist. Have I been a bad mother? It's not important. I don't care. America, Israel, the Hezbollah, Syria or Iran - I don't care. I don't care about religion. My son is lost. The ruins, the bombs. Your help... I don't give a damn. My son is lost. I must find him. Majd? It's Zeina. And you, how are you? I'm not disturbing you? Tell me... Do you remember that colonel, an old friend of Dad? Yes! Do you have his number? No, don't worry. Love too. Bye. It's Zeina, the daughter... You remember me? Very well. I went to see the police about... Can you turn up the music? ...about my son. I thought you could call them to... You think it's going to be OK? My father always said nice things about you. We'll get in touch. He's a good man. He remembers me. - Really? - He promised to help me. I hardly speak Arabic, so forget about French! I'll wait for you here. Are you French? With the arrival of French soldiers, one can only wonder - is Lebanon emerging from the crisis or is France getting sucked into the conflict between Lebanon and Israel? I'm looking for my child. His name's Karim. He was taken from Kherbet Selm. The French journalists took him. He was lost. His aunt died under the rubble. A small boy? His name's Karim, he's six. Brown hair, green eyes. I've heard nothing... They will rebuild infrastructures if necessary. They will of course have bomb disposal and de-pollution capacity. We know that South Lebanon is scattered with mines, booby-traps and clusters. A group of journalists took him during the air strike in Kherbet Selm. - You don't even have a name? - Nothing. You're going to Beirut? I'm in a hurry. What do you think? I'm more in a hurry than you. I'm more in a hurry than you! Because of a lost kid whose mother ignores me! Hang on. Sorry? I'm not going to Beirut! - I'll pay double. - No. I'm not going to Beirut! I'm speaking Arabic, no! Calm down! If you have problems, don't take them out on other people. Pass me Yves. I'm coming. I'm changing taxi. This one's crazy. You have to call the embassy, tell them about your problem in detail and ask them which French teams are over here. What right do they have to do this, without an emergency? What can be more dangerous? It's war! - He's under their responsibility? - It's to protect him. Then, they inform the relevant authorities. Can you write down the number? We're ready to go live. I'd like the French embassy's number. It's an emergency. I'll hold. Ramza, while waiting for the number... We've just sent a report on the 150 French soldiers representing the first of the UNIFIL. We're ready for the live. They're preparing a second landing operation. You mean you might have an answer in a couple of hours. I'll call the embassy in the meantime. If I hear anything, I'll text you. You'll be here tomorrow? I'll wait for your call. Your husband? Until two weeks ago. What happened? With the French. I meant with the journalists. And to think I sent Karim to the South... to protect him from our problems! The car is over there. Can we walk a bit? I'd like to unwind. OK. My husband knows someone in French television. He's trying to find the journalist. Where is this husband? In Jordan. Poor thing, he can't get here. Why do I always defend him? At the beginning of the war I called him in Hong Kong. His secretary didn't even give him the message. Can you imagine? Lebanon's burning, his son's here and he didn't even call. When I called him, he said he'd try to cancel his appointment and take the next plane. His son is under the bombs, and he's afraid of losing a client! How long were you married? A long time. I was twenty. I was stupidly in love. How did I let him take me away from all this? My village. My sister. And you? Why did you cry yesterday? I've never talked to a woman. I mean poured my heart out to a woman. Why did you cry? I know I'll never go to Germany. Not me, not my brother. It's all bollocks. Otherwise I'd have bribed a clerk a long time ago. - What did your brother do? - Nothing. He was just 18! He stuck his neck out. Remember the 82 Israeli invasion of the South? The Israelis were welcomed like liberators. He believed it and joined the SLA, the "allies" of the Israelis. Beaten in 2000, they fled without even saying goodbye. Didn't give a damn! Wait, there's going to be an explosion. He left with them. That's my brother's story. Is he still there? - Where's the explosion? - On the other side. - What explosion? - Cluster bombs. No! It's my husband. He found the journalist. Where? In France? And the kid? He's in hospital. - Is he injured? - He's OK. All the patients in Tyre were transferred to Beirut. Nadine dealt with it. He was scared. He didn't speak. There was shooting everywhere. Explosions... There was the kid injured on the 30th of July. He kept quiet in his corner. I tried to comfort him, to talk to him... Is he still there? - He was afraid? - Very. That's the hospital number. Call them. They have all the details. In a monastery? I'll write it down. Keep in touch. It's past Jezzine. Through the mountains, it's better. He won't say anything. No one knew who he was. Karim. Darling. Karim, can you hear me? It's mummy, darling. Why don't you answer me? I know what's happened. I know you're afraid. That you're angry. But mummy was looking for you, and now she's found you. I'm coming to get you. I'm coming to you. Karim, say something. I brought you a present. What happened? He gave you back the phone? OK. Tell him I'm coming. Look after him well. I don't know, a couple of hours. Look after him. Thank you very much. Shall we go? Why didn't he speak to me? He'll chirp when he sees you. What have I done to this boy! How can we make it up? Zeina... We've been looking for him for two days. Let's get him before dark. Thank you. Two. I have two sons. The oldest is Gregory. The youngest, Elias. I haven't seen them in ages. Gregory is something! He's smart. Elias is a moaner, like his mum. While Gregory... A great football player. A clever boy! But... "Gregory"! What a name! His mother insisted. "It was fashionable!" Fashionable? He isn't a pair of jeans! I don't know... I don't know anymore. I don't know which bridges are down. I've got friends here, they'll know. We have to go back. I know your son's over there. But I'm lost! You think I don't want to get there? You think it's all for the money? I don't care about it! Here, take your money! Where are your friends? Tony! How are you, mate? How are you doing? Mum, come and see who's here. How long has he been promising this visit! Auntie! You're welcome! How are you? How are you keeping? We missed you. - Any damages from the war? - No, thank God. - I missed you. - Me too. This is Zeina. - How are you? - Fine. Come in! - We have to go on. - Impossible. We're in a hurry. They're waiting for us at the monastery. We have to go. - At night, no way! - Yes, auntie. I won't let you move. She hasn't seen her son for a month. He's at the monastery. Khalil, call your friends. Tony, the road is dangerous. Call them anyway. OK, I will. Karim, I'm coming to you, darling. I'm coming to see you, my love. You don't know the country road. Even we get lost! They're riddled with bombs. Tell her what it's like. This road is really dangerous. Any cars going past are taken as targets. But she's such a nice lady. For the Israelis, it's "Death Valley". And for the Hezbollah, "Martyr Valley". - Are there still Israelis? - We don't know. - I saw no one. - You see nobody. Go and play the hero in Beirut. - And the ceasefire? - Already violated by the Israelis. You can leave tomorrow. - I'm ready. - To go where? They say the road's dangerous. - My son's waiting. - He's safe. I promised him. He's safe. Don't worry about him. Come in, please. Dinner's ready. There's chicken, taboule... God is generous. Hey, guys... - Can't we call them? - The lines are down. Even the mobiles don't work. You're looking for this? You want to go there at night? Can you drive? I thought they were going to help us. They will, tomorrow morning. You want me to stuff myself while my son is waiting? He doesn't even know if I'm coming. Zeina, these people know what they're talking about. Come out. Ali had to behave like a man during the war. He lost his parents. He got through to his mother on our phone. I'm near the hospital. I'm alone without money. They've bombed everything, the bastards. Even the Christian villages. To them we're all Arabs. The same shit. Keep your voice down, the walls have ears. There's no danger, don't worry. You can say what you like. Elie did join his brothers in Israel. Whatever the reason, we mustn't go there. They have to return. It's their land! What are you talking about? And what would they do here? In Beirut, who cares? - In Israel, they have social security. - I don't understand. These bastards bomb you, destroy your houses and bridges. Take your children, send you to prison, and you, you work for them? Right? Yes or no? You think my brother Joseph's happy? In his emails... He dreams of coming back. All this, for what? For a stupid thing he did when he was 18. What stupid thing? When your life's at stake, you deal with the devil if you have to. That's what happens. That's right. We know the song. We've been through it enough times. But what can we do? There's no future here. We've tried every policy. - Who's looking after the South? - Stop it! The South is not a land. It's a forlorn corner. You've eaten nothing. I'm not hungry. My aunt sent you some chicken. I know, you're a vegetarian. But she says it makes you stronger. Taste it, it's good. Go on. Enjoy your food! What are we doing here? Get dressed. We're going to get your son. I thought it was too dangerous. I'm going to take that bloody road! I'll wait outside. My son Gregory... he was a mistake. And he was premature. Two months in an incubator. We didn't know if he was going to live. We hadn't anticipated these expenses. I borrowed money. Driving a taxi doesn't bring much. Social security is not enough. Fortunately with Elias, it was easier. And you? Ever thought of giving Karim a brother. I wanted to! I was pregnant twice. And I lost the babies. That's when he started cheating on me. Or that's what I believe. Everybody knew, but me. I was a dumb fool. Watch out, that way! There's the sign. From here on we keep the headlights off. It's about five kilometres. - You know what? - What? Pray. May God help us. Not now! Try to start the car, I'll stall it. Go on! - It won't start. - Try again. Go and hide there. Hide, quickly. - Why? - They'll aim at the car. - They can't see us. - What, they can't see us? What do you think? They have all the ultras - the violets, the reds, the ultra my ass! Go over there. We keep going on foot? It's a 1975 model. Can you hear me? It's from 1975. A 280 S. You can't find them like that anymore! We've been through a lot of things together. I say that so if you see it tomorrow, before throwing your rocket, remember - it's a 280 power steering. If only we had some water. I lost my mobile. You must have dropped it near the car. My husband might be trying to call me. He's going to worry. We'll call him from the monastery. If the lines aren't down. When you get your son back, will you go back to Dubai? My husband swears he has left his mistress. - So you'll go back. - I don't know. I want to be with my son. I want to rebuild my house, in the South. Ah, the South! Good morning, Father. Good morning, Father. You're here for the boy? - Yes. Where is he? - He's waiting. We were just about to send him to the sisters. How is he? He plays with no one. He just stares at the TV. - He's in this room. - Just a minute. Karim? Tarek? They're all dead. This isn't your jacket. It's Karim's. Why are you wearing it? My mother was under the rubble. I took my shirt off to cover her face. When he saw me, he gave me his jacket. Where is Karim? He stayed under the bombs. Under the bombs, most were crushed to death. It is for them that this film was made. To tell the suffering of the innocents.
