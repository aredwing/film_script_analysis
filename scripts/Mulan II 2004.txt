That's what I'm talking about.|How you doing up there, man? Thanks for the intro. And now, I think I'd like to visit|my beloved pedestal. Let's get it over with. Ceremonial robe of honor. If Mulan could see me now. Mulan saves China one time, and now he thinks he's the emperor. I'm climbing a stairway to heaven. Top floor. Pedestals, perks and props. Ceremonial bath of honor. Yeah.|Y'all better take a deep breath now, 'cause I ain't leaving my pedestal for the next thousand years. Let the whirlpool begin. Oh, yeah. According to this chart,|I put the coins here. Relax, child. The spirits tell me Shang will arrive and propose to Mulan|before the sun sets. Still time to get in on the pool. Mother. Gambling is like playing Mah Jongg|with blank tiles. No one really wins. I'm enriched by your presence,|my son. I think I'll go pray. Hello, Sha-Ron. Is Fa Mulan here? She's out in the field. Yeah, doing her chores. I'll go help her. Thank you. The children all love Mulan. And why not? She's strong,|she's brave, she's beautiful. She's a chip off the old block. It's okay, Little Brother.|What's going on here? We want to be like you, Fa Mulan. But I'm still learning myself. Please. Okay. I guess I can show you|a few moves. Mulan's gonna teach us|how to kick butt. Hooray! Hold it, calm down. That's lesson number two. The first and most important lesson|is to be gentle. At the same time, we're being tough. - How can you be tough and gentle?|- Yeah, I want to be tough. Yeah! I know it does|sound a little funny, huh? But the world is full of opposites,|and so are you. To be a good warrior,|you must bring it all into balance. Let's see if this helps. Earth, sky. Day, night. Sound and silence.|Dark and light. One alone is not enough You need both together Winter, summer|Moon and sun - Lesson number one|- Wow! Like a rock|You must be hard Like an oak|You must stand firm Cut quick like my blade Think fast|Unafraid Like a rock|I must be hard Like an oak|I must stand firm Cut quick like my blade Think fast|Unafraid Okay, Mulan, I'm ready. But you're still out of balance.|You're only halfway there. Like a cloud|You are soft Like bamboo|You bend in the wind Creeping slow|You're at peace because you know It's okay to be afraid Like a cloud|I am soft Like bamboo|I bend in the wind Creeping slow|I'm at peace because I know It's okay to be afraid One alone is not enough You need both together Winter, summer|Moon and sun Lesson number one Like a rock|I must be hard Like bamboo|I bend in the wind - You can fly|- Im at peace because I know It's okay to be afraid - You have begun|- Lesson number one It's General Shang. Hello, little warriors. Your new uniform suits you, General. The uniform, yes. Now I just have to live up to it. Of course you will.|You're very brave. Oh, right. Brave. Yes, well... Mulan, I haven't known you|for very long, but I feel that doesn't matter so much|when a man is in... When a man is in... Is there someplace private|we can talk? We can go to my house. Okay, everybody. Time to be like the river|and flow home. Bye, Shang. Bye, Mulan. Could you take care of this for me? You're never gonna get that back. She said yes. When one's heart|is overfilled with joy, some may spill from the eyes. You can say that again. I win the pot. Actually, you bet he would propose|before sundown. I bet he would propose|before noon. But, you don't gamble. Betting against my mother|is not a gamble. It's an investment. Oh, what a happy day. My little baby's getting married. Mushu, someone will hear you. I can't help it.|You know dragons are very emotional. Seems like just last month,|you and I were saving China. - It was last month.|- How time flies. You know, this must be|a magical moment for you. It's not every day I get engaged. I meant telling me you're engaged. I'm the guy that gave you|and pretty boy the hook-up. Am I a guardian,|or am I a guardian? You're more than that. You're my most trusted friend. - Oh, that did it.|- Are you crying again? No, I just got some|exfoliating cream in my eye. Of course I'm crying, girl.|What you think? Oh, Mulan. - I'm just so happy for me.|- You? This wedding business|is a big status boost for me. When the ancestors|look up the career ladder, all they're gonna see is my behind. So glad my getting married|is helping you out. All right, I get you, Miss Missy.|But I'm thinking about you too. I'll plan your wedding.|I gotta work me up a theme. Theme is everything. How about "Rainbow of Memories?" That's too junior prom.|I've got it. The theme is, "Think Pink." You know, pink is the new red.|It's simple, it says it. Watch my smoke. Cri-kee, to the fabric store. Mulan, seems your grandma|invited someone to help us celebrate|the engagement. Really? Who? - China.|- Congratulations! Isn't it wonderful? Sorry it's sort of slapdash. It took us by surprise, you know. Make way for the happy couple. - Now this is a battlefield.|- What's our strategy, General? Divide and conquer. All right, dead people. We've got work,|so move with purpose. I've got an important announcement|to make. Hold on to your ectoplasm now.|Mulan's getting married. All right. Simmer down.|I know just how you feel. But time is wasting. Move. The theme is pink. I want to see pink flowers,|ribbons, bows. I'm not talking about salmon.|No blush. I mean pink as a freshly-slapped|newborn's behind. - How about a pink slip?|- Excuse me? Nobody wants to see your drawers,|Prunehilda. Actually, she meant this. Hey, this looks like|a for-real pink slip. You know,|like a "you're fired" pink slip. - Oh, it is.|- Say what? The pink slip is for you. It is written,|once a woman marries, her husband's ancestors take over the duty|of guardianship. No. Your scroll must have a typo.|That can't be. - But it is. You're out of a job.|- Out of a pedestal. And out of our hair, fool. No, no.|I ain't going out like this. It took me 500 years to get|this pedestal back, and I ain't about to give it up. Hear me, you lazy lounge lizard. The moment Fa Mulan is married,|you've got your old job back. Remember gong duty? Perhaps this will ring a bell. Mushu's on his way out Mushu's on his way out Mushu's on his way out Mushu's on his way out What am I gonna do? - So, tell me, will it be a big wedding?|- Absolutely. No, absolutely not. - Children?|- As many as possible. Maybe one or two. - We'll think about it.|- Right away. - Blue... Mild... Yes.|- Pink... Spicy... No. Oh, dear. Did you hear that? - Not exactly a harmonious couple.|- What should we do? Perhaps we should give our gift|to the children now. General Shang, Fa Mulan,|orders from His Majesty, the Emperor. - Is there trouble?|- Yes. Report to the lmperial Palace. We'll leave at once. This must be important|for the emperor to want both of us. He knows a winning team|when he sees one. Since when are they the winning team? Ink's not dry on my pink slip,|and I'm being replaced. Yeah, I know. You're right. How could I have been so selfish? Look at them.|Those two clearly got it going on. I've made a decision.|I've got to kiss my pedestal good-bye, cos my girl's happiness comes first. - Baba. Mama.|- We were admiring the mudan tree. It's so lovely this year. The blossoms reach|for the sunlight above, yet, unseen, the roots reach|for the rainwater below. Sun and rain. So different,|yet only by working together do they create harmony and life. I know, the lesson of yin and yang. And, to help you|remember that lesson... Father, mother, your necklaces. Not ours, our great-great grandparents'. And now, yours. - Thank you, sir.|- Oh, they're so beautiful. But, you'll be surprised how heavily|they can weigh. To share the burden,|you must work together, Iike the sun and rain. Wait a minute,|old man Fa-Zhou got a point now. Mulan and Shang|are as different as sun and rain. When the infatuation wears off, their tree of life is going to|wind up with root rot. Yeah, sure. She seems happy.|That's the real tragedy. The girl don't even realise|how miserable she is. That's why I gotta|nip this thing in the bud. This is not about my pedestal. This is about Mulan making|the biggest mistake of my... I mean, her life. Man, how could I have been so selfish? Mulan's a girl worth fighting for. And, after all,|I am the girl's guardian. Cri-Kee, I'm gonna break them up. So, I guess that means|you're on board? Mulan, could you smooth out the ride|a little? I'm getting horse sick. - Mushu, what are you doing here?|- Whither thou go, I goeth, girl. Remember, teamwork ain't about ego,|it's about "we go." Cri-Kee, what are you doing here? Protect Mulan from me?|I'm her guardian. Yeah, you're her lucky cricket.|Lucky I don't break out the bug spray. As we stand here, Mongol forces|are moving closer to our border. The threat of attack|is growing every day. As it is, our army's|hopelessly outnumbered. Your Majesty, let me lead my forces|in a pre-emptive strike. Each of my warriors|will fight like ten Mongols. No, General. I plan to defeat this enemy|without the use of force. Instead, we will|forge a union so strong, the Mongol hordes|won't dare attack. An alliance with|the kingdom of Qui Gong. We will become united|through marriage. You will escort three princesses|to Qui Gong. There, they will marry|Lord Chin's sons, and seal this critical alliance. Yes, Your Majesty. My advisors tell me|the charts are clear. If this wedding does not take place|in three days, the alliance will crumble and|the Mongols will destroy us. Mark my words, General.|Three days. Not a moment more. I know that face, Fa Mulan.|What troubles you? Your Majesty, an arranged marriage? Rest assured, child. My daughters know exactly|what they're doing. Your daughters? They consider it an honor to marry|in the cause of peace. Your Majesty, l... Apology accepted. General, how many troops|do you estimate you will need - to accomplish this mission?|- Three. - Companies?|- Three men. You surprise me.|These are my children. This mission does not call|for force, but finesse. We must become one|with the countryside. As emperor, I trust you. As a father, I implore you|to choose your three soldiers wisely. - I know just the men. Fearless.|- Loyal. - Disciplined.|- China's most honourable and noble soldiers. And stay out! I've found wives|for hundreds of men, but the Golden Dragon of Unity himself couldn't make love matches|for you three. Come back when|you get personalities. Well, that's a fine way|to treat China's greatest... ...heroes. What's her problem? All I asked for was a girl who|would worship the dirt I walk on. I simply asked for someone who would|cook for me morning, noon and night. And I just wanted a girl|who likes to laugh, and thinks I'm a god. Perhaps we weren't specific enough. Forget that dragon lady. The only ones who can|find girls worthy of us is us. Yeah. Well, I don't need her|To be all smug and snooty I got a plaque right here|That says I kicked Hun booty We have everything|We dreamed we'd find When we came back from war Yeah, everything but... A girl worth fighting for - Hey, suck in your gut.|- There's a girl worth fighting for And I think she wants us|to come over. My girl won't laugh at all my jokes|But tell it to me straight She'll rub my head when I get sick And let me pick off of her plate If Ling can find a girl|Who likes his chopstick nose trick He really better just propose quick Well, I have to say|Based on today, I'm cranky - I'll just spend my life with you two|- Pass the hanky And there's no one there|To steal my chair And twirl around the floor I wish I had|A girl worth fighting for I would be true|To a girl worth fighting... I'd make fondue|For a girl worth fighting... I'd even kiss you|For a girl worth fighting For Mulan. General Shang. If you three aren't too busy|disturbing the peace, I need you to join us|on a mission. - To save China?|- Naturally. I'll be leaving behind a few|broken hearts, but count me in. - Sign me up.|- When do we start, General? Tonight. We're about to depart, Your Highnesses. You have my word|we will arrive swiftly and safely. My sisters and I thank you. Permit me to introduce Fa Mulan. It is a privilege|to meet the hero of China. I leave you in her capable hands. - Stand ready.|- You might need these. It's chilly. - Thank you.|- You're welcome, Your Highness. So, you're getting married. - Oh, yes.|- To princes in Qui Gong. - That's right.|- Well, they must be handsome. We don't know.|We've never met them. Really? So you have no idea|what they're like? - At all?|- It's all right. It's our honor to serve the emperor. - And the Middle Kingdom.|- The whole thing is so exciting. We're very happy. Really. Well, I'm glad to hear that. - I'm not sure I could go through...|- Prepare to move out. Time to get going. Move out. If we get to the Honshu Pass|by midday tomorrow... We'll have time|to make it to Qui Gong. Yeah. Just enough time to stop Mulan from making|the biggest mistake of my... I mean, her life. - What's the face?|- What face? - That face.|- There's no face. This is my face. That's all. You know I know you better than that.|What's wrong? - I realise our duty is to the mission.|- But... But I have another duty.|To my heart. Mulan. - Your only duty is to the emperor.|- But an arranged marriage? I know, but not everyone|can be as lucky as we are. In an ideal world,|everyone would marry for love, but the world isn't perfect. I'm just glad my world is. "My world". Talk about selfish. You don't hear me bragging about|how it's my world, even though it is. I'm telling you,|the sooner I bust them apart, the better things will be for Mulan. And so, I said, "You just broke|my best set of china." - China. Get it?|- Did you see the way she looked at me? You mean with disgust? No. Our eyes met and we shared|a cosmic moment. Just like when I look at|potted pigs' knuckles. It's love, I tell you. Love... Love, shmove. It doesn't matter.|We're on a mission. No fraternizing with the princesses. Engaged-to-be-married princesses. Wow. China is so big. Isn't it beautiful, Mei? Mei? Yes, beautiful. Did you see the way|he looked at me? Who? The gorilla with the bad eye? Gorilla? He's more like|a big, cuddly panda bear. - But you didn't even talk to him.|- A true romantic can tell. He may be coarse on the outside,|but on the inside... - He's gross?|- I mean under that. He smells? I can see past my nose.|Deep down. Deep, deep down. Way down. There's something. Ting-Ting, I think she's in love. No, there'll be none of that. Remember, Mei, you are|to be married in three days. You gave your solemn oath. You're right. Whoa. We're stopping to water the horses. - Maybe you'd like to stretch your legs?|- Are the guard fellows out there? Yes, you're perfectly safe. I think a leg stretch|would be very nice. Thank you for helping me|with my slipper. May I know your name? Now. Dow. Cow. Bao? No, you must eat. It must be exhausting guarding us|day and night. No. Well, yes. But I'm strong and marching. Yes, I suppose all that training|does make it second nature. But I think you, a princess,|with royal... - I could never.|- But it is our duty and our honor. Although it can be a burden. I've said too much.|You are very easy to talk to, Yao. Permit me to echo your praise. I find your presence engaging|and your conversation sparkling. Thank you. Hello, there. I am Ling. I am Princess Ting-Ting. Well, if you ever need me,|just give me a ting-a-ling. Come on, Your Highness.|You don't want to let your guard down. Get it? Guard... down?|Thank you. You know,|I've got some blue blood myself. Many have called me a royal pain.|Thank you. You've been a great crowd. Ting-Ting, look.|Isn't this fruit lovely? Chien-Po got it for me.|He's so sweet. Just get your pomegranates|in the carriage. - Fa Mulan.|- Your Highness. Is anything wrong? No, not at all. Are you sure? I just wanted to compliment you. You were so brave|to take your father's place in the army. Well, thank you. Your duty was to stay home, but your heart told you|to break the rules. How did you decide|between duty and heart? Well, it wasn't easy. But, by following my feelings,|I wound up doing the right thing. I guess I learned that|my duty is to my heart. My duty is to my heart. Yes. That makes sense.|That's marvelous. Thank you, Fa Mulan. You're welcome... I guess. Let's get back on the road. That's my cue to put|Operation Shang into action. Pretty boy's gonna look so bad,|it'll send Mulan running for the hills. This is gonna be delicious. Watch this. Hey! Good catch. What? Shang? Hey. Tasty. I try and I try. I put my heart and soul|into busting them up. And what do I have to show for it? A cricket that laughs in my face. I just can't do it anymore. Oh, great ancestors,|I throw myself at your mercy. My pedestal is all|but a distant memory. Great spirits, take me now. Ah! Hold on, ladies. - We'll save you.|- Look out! A cliff. They're headed for the cliff.|Come on. - Time to go.|- Ting-Ting, over here. Go. - You're next, Su.|- No, no. Take my arm. Ting-Ting's stuck. Mulan, the rope. Hang on! Is everyone all right? - Mei, I'll save you.|- I saved the food. And I saved you. Mulan! - What happened?|- I don't know. - I wasn't near the carriage.|- Yao, Ling, save the supplies. Keep paddling.|Look how great you're doing. - Who's the big boy?|- Thank you. My fault? This wasn't my plan.|Wagon's busted. Cold and miserable.|Everything's ruined. Or maybe not. Old Shang's steaming|like a fresh pork bun. I bet he and Mulan are two nasty words|away from an all-out feud. Oh, Cri-Kee,|things are brightening up after all. - I've seen happier princesses.|- That's the least of our problems. There's a mountain pass|between here and Qui Gong. It takes us through bandit country,|but it's the only way. Why not just follow the river? Because the river's|not on the map. It's bound to go past a town and|where there's a town, there's a road. There's no town on the map. Then maybe we should just|forget the map and wing it. We can't wing it. We need a new plan.|We have three days. - What if we get lost?|- Then we pull over and ask directions. We don't need to pull over|and ask directions. We have a map. What is with men|and asking directions? - What is it with women and maps?|- You're saying women can't read maps? Women will ask|but they won't follow directions. ...because they refuse to ask. Am I interrupting? - What is it?|- Scout report. I found a village and a path to it|through the forest. A forest path? Great. Show us. See. If it were a snake,|it would've bit you. There's bound to be a road|that will lead us to Qui Gong. - Good work.|- Thank you, sir. Shang, I'm sorry.|You're in charge of the mission. No, I'm the one who's sorry.|A good leader is open to new ideas. - Forgive me.|- There's nothing to forgive. I'd better go.|I've got the first watch, General. But... Are you bugging? Look at her go.|She can't wait to get away from him. That's no smile.|That's a mask of pain. That was just phase one|of my new 1 8-phase master plan. Now, just watch phase two|when I get up close... ...and personal. Excuse me, Your Highness.|I found your fan. It just needed a little drying out. Thank you, Ling. Normally, I would say,|"I'm your biggest fan." But... I'll just go away now, again. Sorry. I'll replace that. Of course she doesn't like you.|You're such a ding-a-ling. He likes you. It would seem so. And you like him. Well, I appreciate|that he's a good soldier. How can you do that? How can you look at someone,|realise you share a connection, - and then just...|- I know where my duty lies. Do you? And so, my dear father, I cannot complete this mission. I have come to realise that my duty - is to my heart.|- What are you doing? - She's running away.|- What are you thinking? I can't complete this mission.|I know that now. Why?|Because Yao has given you his heart? No. It's not about his heart.|It's about mine. We've discussed this. A princess must make every sacrifice|for her country. It's our duty. The life of a princess From her birth is well-defined She must humbly serve her country Play the part she's been assigned She guards the hopes of her people Weak and mighty|Rich and poor Who could ever ask for more Who could ever ask for more Who could ever ask for more I want to be like other girls Climb up a tree like other girls can Just to be free like other girls Get to be Mei. Su. - To slouch when I sit|- To eat a whole cake - Feel the sun on my feet|- Get dirty - Act silly|- Be anything I want to be - Dance around|- In my underwear - To run really fast|- To get rid of this fan - To eat a whole cake|- Get crazy - With frosting, no manners|- No escorts, no nursemaids No worries|No hands folded perfect Like holding a lily No pinchy shoes?

She insulted you. - She laughed at your map.|- My map. And if she's laughing to your face, imagine what she's saying|behind your back. Behind my back. She's a loose cannon.|She's out of control. - She's out of control.|- Who's in charge here? - You? Or Mulan?|- I'm in charge. Mulan... Mulan! Mulan? General Shang?|No, that's not it. General Shang?|Hello, it's me, Mulan. General Shang... Shang, Shang, Shang. I got it. General Shang? General Hardhead,|that's what they should call him. - Everything's got to have a strategy.|- Mulan? The man won't brush his teeth|without a back-up plan. - What?|- I blame myself. I fell for those broad shoulders. I didn't realise there wasn't|much sitting on top of them. Except for that garlic breath. That boy can peel paint. That's enough.|Where is she? I am good. - Mulan!|- Why, hello, General. Out on night maneuvers? General Hardhead?|Brushing my teeth? - Something wrong?|- I heard you. - Every word.|- Every word of what? Don't play coy.|I saw you outside my tent. What? I haven't left my post. I suppose you weren't gossiping|about me with the princesses. Did that dip in the river|get you waterlogged? And why are you talking with|your hand over your mouth? I wouldn't want to peel your paint. Changing of the guard. And next time,|don't leave your post. What's with him? What's with her? Who am I talking to? How could he not believe me? I don't know, girlfriend.|But I do know this... Without trust,|there can be no relationship. And that man don't trust you. Maybe he was just confused. You fussed about the arranged marriage,|then about which way to Qui Gong. Now y'all feuding over nothing.|It seems clear. You're right. - I don't know what to do.|- I do. It's simple. Drop him like a hot potsticker.|Kick him to the curb. Burn his letters and dance around|the fire yelling, "Happy days are here." You have a point.|If this is the real Li-Shang, I don't like what I'm seeing. I hope the tea's still warm. - After you.|- No, after you. - No, after you.|- After you. I said, after you. - You. I'm gonna...|- Yao! - Is everything all right?|- No. I mean, yes. You see, Chien-Po here|has always had a dream. - A dream?|- A dream? - A dream.|- But I don't... That dream. A dream of seeing a small village in the middle of nowhere|by the moonlight. - How can we help?|- Well... If Your Highnesses would consent|to come with us to the village, we could still guard you,|and Chien-Po could have his dream. My one chance|to be like other guys. - Can we please?|- Please, please. Sounds like fun. Oh, we're sorry. We're off. I never noticed|we were so different. It's like I don't even know him. Well, what do you know about that? I mean, I know|he's "by the book," but doesn't the man ever bend a rule? Speaking of bending rules... You know, relationships are easy|when everything runs nice and smooth. Nice and smooth|just ran out of camp. - What?|- Did you know almonds, rice and milk are part of a complete breakfast? I'm trying to tell you|the princesses went AWOL. - Where are the guards?|- Showing them the way. They're together? - Together together?|- Don't you understand Chinese? Hey, what about old Shang-hai? I think I'd better handle|this one on my own. Shang's on a short fuse, as it is. Just make sure|nothing wakes him up. You can count on me. Where are the guards?|The princesses! "My duty is to my heart?" Mulan. Get your ticket.|The show's about to begin. Wow. Look at all the food. We just got in|some excellent ginger. Ginger. That goes very well|with dumplings. - Did you say dumplings?|- How about some fresh ginseng? That makes a wonderful accompaniment|to soy beans. One order of soy beans. Oh, my. Who will be next to challenge|the undefeated Shi Rongkai? - Step aside.|- Yao. You'll be killed, little man. Where'd he go? Yao! You're my hero. Pick a prize, any prize. Which one do you want, sir? Gimme that one. Okay, how about this one? What does Attila say|when he walks through the door? Hun, I'm home. I give up. I guess I'm not|as funny as I think. What a cute laugh. No. I hate my laugh. What? It's adorable. I thought you didn't have|a sense of humor. No sense of humor? It's so beautiful. Yeah. It's the same moon|we see from the palace. No, this one is entirely different. You're right. I know I've never|seen anything like it. I'm listening. We... that is... I... all of us... Oh, boy. Fa Mulan, it's love.|Yao and myself, - Chien-Po and Su...|- And myself and Lingy-Bear. I mean, Ling. Group hug. I'm so happy for all of you. - General Shang.|- General Shang. Oh, boy. Excuse me.|Excuse me. Don't worry.|I'll handle this. I'm so sorry to break up|your little party. This is gonna be good. Before you jump to conclusions,|let me explain. Fine. Why don't we start with this? - That's mine.|- All yours? Or did you have help?|"And so, my dear father, I cannot complete this mission." "l have come to realise that|my duty is to my heart." - Who does that sound like?|- Mei never meant to send it. Your Highnesses, you swore a vow|to be married in Qui Gong. If your father saw you now,|breaking that vow, what would he say? You three are to escort their highnesses|back to their tents immediately. You are to guard them. You are not|to enter their tents or speak to them. Not a word. Ever.|Am I understood? Yes, sir. - The problem isn't as bad as it seems.|- The problem is you. What? You place your feelings|above everything. Duty, obligation, tradition,|it all means nothing to you. It means everything to me. My heart tells me my duty|and I follow it. You're a brilliant warrior. You're brave, you're loyal,|but you don't trust your heart. Sometimes I wonder|if you even have one. This assignment has made it clear. We are very different people. Maybe too different. Fine. We have a mission to complete. Fine. Isn't it a great day? I see pretty boy isn't talking to you. And you're not talking to pretty boy. You know, you can always talk to me. Wait till she realises|what I've done for her. Will that frown turn upside down. Snapdragon. Just for that,|I'm not talking to you. We're so sorry|for what we've done. You inspired us to follow our hearts, and we repay you|by ruining your relationship. No, you just opened my eyes|to how broken it was. I'm indebted to you. Keep a sharp eye.|This is bandit country. I sure wish we could|talk to the princesses. What? You know we can't. Yes, I also wish|we could talk to them. But as you know,|orders is orders. Yes, but if I could talk to them, do you know what I would say? No, what would you say|if only you could? I'd tell Ting-Ting that she's|the prettiest, funniest, most extraordinary girl|I've ever met. I would tell Princess Su|that she is like fresh ginger on the rice bowl of my life. And I would tell Mei|that she's one right babe. Mulan, what do you say|to a little pick-me-up? My father said, "Differences can|make you stronger." He didn't realise that Shang and l|are just too different. Well, you know,|you've always got me. The old team, right? You're always looking out for me. Just doing the best I can. Really, I just don't know|what I'd do without you. You're the best friend|I've ever had. I can't stand it no more. The only thing wrong|with you and Shang... ...is me.|I'm the one that got between you. What are you talking about? You didn't make the carriage|go into the river. That was an accident, following|several attempts at on purpose. It wasn't you outside Shang's tent. You know how I gab. You woke him up after I left? It wasn't easy.|That man can sleep. - What did you do?|- I was banging pots and pans... No. What did you do? You was getting married.|Everything was gonna change. I was gonna lose you.|And my pedestal. You got between Shang and me|so you could keep your job? I'm sorry. What you did was unforgivable. But you and Shang are so different. Wait a second.|Not as different as I thought. All those problems, they weren't us.|They were you. I've got to talk to Shang.|Tell him I love him. I'll make it up to you.|I promise. Forget it.|You've helped enough. Shang! Shang! - It's an ambush.|- Bandits. Close ranks.|Save the princesses. You two, get the gold.|You two, come with me. I've got them. I've got your back. Take my hand. The princesses. How dare you touch me. - It won't budge.|- Then take the whole package. Get your hands off her. Hold them off. Let's go. Help me. Run. Mei! Come on. Let's get out of here. - Shang, hang on.|- It won't hold us both. It will. Mulan. - I'm sorry.|- Please. Shang! Shang! Fa Mulan, we're ready|to go through with the wedding. No. Your orders are|to take care of each other. But... Losing Shang|will not be meaningless. No matter what it takes,|I'm finishing this mission. Good horse. What do you mean,|they are gone? There was an accident,|Lord Chin. The royal carriage fell in the river|and was destroyed. A grave loss. But it does not alter|my agreement with the emperor. And unless it is honored, I will sanction no alliance|with the Middle Kingdom. - A marriage was promised.|- A marriage there will be. I would be honored|to wed a prince of Qui Gong. You? My lord, Fa Mulan,|the hero of China. A jewel in your crown, far more dear than|three mere princesses. This is not what was agreed. However, the Golden Dragon of Unity smiles upon you today. And in view of the tragedy, I will accept your offer. You will make a fine bride|for my eldest son, Prince Jeeki. This is her?|She's so old. Mulan said she was gonna finish|the mission, no matter what. - But how can she without us?|- By taking your place. Shang's alive. Mulan was right. No one should|marry someone they don't love. - I'm going to Qui Gong.|- We're going too. No, you're not. Stay here. Would you say that was an order? I would say|it was a friendly suggestion. Let's go. Looks like we won't|be a team after all, Mushu. Mulan. I would give up a thousand pedestals|if I could stop this. I doubt even the Golden Dragon of Unity|could stop this now. Good-bye, Mushu. My people, the Golden Dragon of Unity,|who guides us in all we do, today sanctifies a union that will be a blessing|for all of Qui Gong. Of course I want to stop it.|But what can one itty bitty dragon do? With the tying of this sash, we shall unite not only two lives, but two kingdoms. - It's General Li-Shang.|- He's alive. Yeah. Shang to the rescue. Lucky for Lord Chin,|cos I was about to whip his butt. You're alive. I couldn't let you get married|without me. This is outrageous.|You will leave at once. I'm not going anywhere. - What are you doing?|- I don't know. I'm winging it. How dare you trample|upon this sacred ceremony? Oh, my gosh. He's gonna|lower the hammer on Shang. Where's the dang Dragon of Unity|when you need him? Don't bother me now, l... I have an idea. My lord, I love Mulan.|I don't care what the rules say. If she'll have me, I intend to marry her|right here. Right now. Insolent dog. Seize him. What's with all this drama? The Golden Dragon of Unity.|He lives. Mushu? You dang right, I live. So you best drop|your dumpling-eating behind on down and tell me why|we ain't busting out the vows. But your greatness, General Li-Shang|is not a son of Qui Gong. Silence! I am the Golden Dragon of Unity, and I decide whom to unify. My all-seeing eye has peered into the very heart of China. And I've never seen two people|more right for one another than this lovely couple right here,|Mulan and Shang. Give it up for them,|would you please? Now, I command you|to proceed at once. Yes, your greatness.|As you command. Let's get to business.|Mulan, do you love Shang? Of course.|Shang, do you love Mulan? Yes. Moving on.|By the power vested in me, by me, I hereby pronounce you|husband and wife. You got anything to say,|Lord Double Chin? Yes, I mean, no.|I mean, whatever you say. And furthermore, I hereby decree that|the princesses of the Middle Kingdom, wherever they may be,|are released from their vow, and may marry|whomsoever they please. And who pleases them,|that's very important. Honey pie. I can't believe|I'm back on wake-up duty. Well, Mulan is happy. If she's happy, I'm happy. Thank you.|I did do good, didn't l? You better get your rest.|I have a yoga session at dawn. And I don't want to be late for|my "greetings to the sun." And don't forget, I like to be awakened|from my beauty sleep with a nice, long foot massage. I think I'm gonna be sick. - Shang, what are you doing?|- Watch and see. - What is he doing?|- It can't be. He's combining the family temples. Excuse me, what does that mean exactly?|For me? - It means...|- What? It means what? Unfortunately, you get|to keep your pedestal. Oh, yeah. I'm back, baby. I am back. Yes. So, this is the famous Mushu? Somehow, I pictured you bigger. Say what? You told him about me?|About us? I have no secrets|from my husband. I told him everything. Everything everything? That's right,|Great Golden Dragon of Unity. I still don't get it. What does|combining our temples do? It gives me back my pedestal. Wait. Can you do this?|Aren't there rules? Of course. Right next to the rules about dressing|up like a man and joining the army. Well, what do you know?|This might work out, after all. Hey, where's my masseuse? Saving China gives me knots|you wouldn't believe. What about my pedicure?|Let's get jamming on the toe jam. And somebody heat up some oil. I don't know what we're gonna|do with it yet, but it's gonna be good. Does a hero dragon|deserve anything less? Draw my bath.|Warm my towel. Let the pampering begin!
