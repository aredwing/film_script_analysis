It's my tits. You try to tap my ass? Where's my phone then? Who's put it out far? How thoughtless! Who's calling? Hello? Yeah, I'm listening, not sleeping. All right. Talk to me. I'm not sleeping. Die Harder : Scene 7: Cut 3: Take 40 Cut! Your bomb was perfect. Do it one more time. Let's make it more explosive. Like it could blow your goddamn family sky-high. Okay? That's more like it! Action! Yippee-kai-yay! Motherfucker! Damn! Song! What're you doing here? Just wanna tell you I'm leaving. Don't worry. Those bastards want you to tell me now? No, it's my decision. I found this on the floor over there. Is it yours? - Yeah, it's mine. - Damn! Queue! Die! Oh I forgot! Yippee-kai-yay! - I forgot too. - What else? They change the place. Have they got too much special effect? I totally feel Bruce Willis now. Die. Boom! How can I go there? Well, you just drive through Ekamai road. - From Sukhumvit. - Ekamai. On Ekamai, there's a big window display. - Yeah, I know it. - Not that one. It's 1 0 meters further. Die. You're all gonna die. Tell your boss. When you change the damn title and that shitty actor... ...then you come get me. Directing people gives me only problems. I'd rather go back to directing my dogs. Ma-kam, c'mon. Come here. Come. - Let's go. - Hey, Pook! - Pook! - Pook! Dozing off, Ching? Slipped out just a little. In my hood, it's called falling asleep. Get up for a rest. Don't sleep too hard. You'll get sick. How far you got it edited? Show me. Mr.Pong, everyone says this road-bend is scary. They called it "1 00 bodies-bend". Sometimes they see the guardian spirit... ..come out watching the police pick up the bodies. Hey!.. Lights. Lights. Lights.. Lights on. All right, folks. Let's go with Miss Buaklee. No now we're gonna.... Listen to some ghost's songs and we will be back with more stories. Anything else you wanna change? No, I think it's okay. Add the Admin Officer's footage at the end. OK? Give me the sexiest look. Jazz, it's your phone. Keep calling like I'm your dog. I'm shooting the last set, then it's done. Going by myself. Nobody else. Hey! Told you I'm going by myself. Jazz? I am ready. I change my mind. Cheers. Shouldn't drink too much. Song, let me ask you something. Give me a straight answer. - All right. - I can take it. How did I act today? Den, my man. I'm so impressed. You're way better than Hollywood actors. Listen to you talking.... ...It surely turns me on. And what are you waiting for, Darling? This is worth dying for. Let's do it! Hey, stop. It's embarrassing. Jazz.. Jazz's here. Jazz is here. Singh! After I punch Jazz in the stomach. You drag that bitch to the back. Asshole. And me? What you want me to do? Stay with me. Wow. - Hi, guys! - What's up? This is Rai. Nice girl. She's quiet, not very chatty. Take a good care of her, all right? - Nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you. I can do for her more than that. Hello. Hey! Let's drink! - Huh? - Cheers. Stop staring. Looks good. Who order this? What is this shit? It's foul. Singh the omelette boy! Your omelette doesn't smell that good. This's good stuff. Let me show you. You don't have to. Sarai, take care of this brother, honey. Gladly. What do you want? Careful, it will spill. Wait, wait. Stop. Let me do it. You just sit. What? Why don't you eat? Here. Stinky. No more. Big piece here. Big bite. C'mon. Hey! Eat it. Good music. I don't know. You ask Jazz. Jazz is the organizer. Yeah yeah, I forgot. I'm here to discuss a school reunion party. Only our class. Others aren't included. It's set on Saturday 1 5th, next month. I'm gonna tell you what we have to prepare. About food and beverage and the PR. Entertainment. And the most important... You and me, we were good friends just yesterdays But now our friendship is gradually fading away Being close's transformed it into one deep love. You're listening to FM 1 03 Virgin Soft. I have a new cover-version of an old song about friends... It's quite good. You and me, we were good friends just yesterdays But now our friendship is gradually fading away Being close's transformed it into one deep love Come on, get in. Are you all right? This is for you. Everybody, greet your teacher. - Good morning, Sir. - Good morning, Sir. Same old faces, all pain in the ass. This year you have to change. Pay attention to study. Because this is your last year here. If possible, I wish you all go to university. Quiet, quiet! You are always noisy! This year you have two new friends. First one, please introduce yourself. I'm Sayan Suksiri. Transferred from Keknoi School, Petchaboon. Welcome to my world, sunshine. Don't tell me your stage name is Sinatra. Right? All right, the next one... This school starts at 8 o'clock. I'm sorry, sir. I'll let you go this time since it's your first. But don't let it happen again. Introduce yourself to your classmates. Hello. I'm Mituna (June) Prueksawan. Transferred from Sateeworawan School. You name is Mituna? (June) We already have Singha (August) and now Mituna (June). June, July... July is missing. No, not missing. July is June and August's child. Smartass! Be quiet. - I'll be back. - Go take a seat. Come. Hey sit here. This seat isn't taken. Don't look at them. They are nasty and girls maniac. - I'm Jazz. - I'm Kanda. You can call me Dakanda. Dakanda!!! The ugly duckling! Bastard! Hey. Are you stupid or just dumb? It's one baht a piece. One bath a piece? Who buy it is stupid. The more you buy, the more stupid you are. Song! Talking shit like that, you want a piece of me? Hey! Move. You want it? Take it and give my money back. I won't eat it. Whether you eat it or not... You'll get no refund whatsoever. I'll give it to my pets. Beat it! - Stupid ass! - Stupid ass! You guys eat it. I bought it for you. Get on with the story. It's getting juicy. Oh yeah. When you snuff it first time. You will see it double. When you snuff it again. You will feel heavy. Your voice starts to change. - And when you snuff it one more time... - What kind of ghost is it? Smelling-salts ghost. Bastard! Last time it was Shoe ghost, Lizard ghost! Bra ghost! I'm going to get you. Singha, it's not worth it. Go go go. Don't start a fight. That shithead... He's showing off a hooker on his bike. How does it look cool? But his brother runs a brothel. We'd better not mess with him. Not worth it. Going home now, Sinatra? Hey Sinatra! Don't leave yet. Come sing for us first. Prick! Song. He calls you..Pretty. That's new girl. - All right. Watch this. - Okay. Going home? Where is your house? I think you're in my neighbourhood. Soi Anake, isn't it? Don't tell me you're mute. What about your folks? Are they all mute too? Tell them...'Bleat...bleat' Good job. And here we are again, "The Hood News". We'll start this morning with the headlines. Hit man Gang was massacred. Late last night, around midnight. Somewhere In Rama Three Road... It didn't say exactly where. - Eat some boiled rice. - I'm already late, Mom. There was a Hit man gang of Joe. Police got tipped off that they'll gather at a house. Dad hasn't been back yet, mom? No, I'm worried. I'm home. I'm going. Bye Mom. Bye Dad. You worked all night? Don't listen to this nonsense. When I shot those bastards, he was asleep. He tells like he saw it. How was it? At 1 am they were about to surrender. When we made a move. They fired at us. So Captain gave us a green light... ...to take them all. Finished almost in the morning. Just keep it for me. All right. Eat some rice. I have eaten it before. You're a rookie at this. If you wanna be a beatnik, eat more veggies. C'mon, Dad! - Give it to me. - Dad! - Dad! - Eat up. Please leave him alone. Let him eat peacefully for once. Mom, look at him. You're such a rat! Monday - Friday...I'm here at school. Saturday - Sunday... I have to help mom at the shop. Tell me. When do I have time to flirt? A man like you can flirt anytime. This weekend, are you free? If I tell you, you'll call me a flirt. But... This weekend my parents will be out of town visiting relatives. Pew! When is he gonna change his sweet talk? Same script every time. Stay away from him, I'm telling you. And when will you be free? If not next week, then next month for sure. Why is it so long? - Hey! - What is it? What's with the clap? Yeah right. I'm here to tell you, Singh. I figure out why your silent girl isn't talking. It has nothing to do with you. Is the food here good enough for you? If you don't like it, you have to bare with it. Can't be as luxury as your home. Who are you talking about, Singha? Everybody is equal here. No matter who their parents are. Why acting all snobbish? I don't get it. Who're you talking about? Whose parents is that? You didn't talk about me, right? Don't make me say it out loud. You two listen carefully. Your friend here is a Director General's daughter. She won't be your friend. You're far out of her league. Oh wow! Your dad is a Director General? I knew it. I knew you're someone special. I think he might be another Director General's son. His snobby-o-meter is just as high. Hey Sinatra. If anybody here picks on you... tell them you're in my gang. I'm the big boss here. Some friends! You should be here to study, not start a fight. Why you have a knife? Tutoring is good. Diligent kids tutoring each other is also good. But why you have to do it at my place everyday? When they're here if we don't feed them they call us stingy. I love you all but don't come around often. It's your comfort at my expense. And why am I telling you this? Ar-sun, sit properly! Your Willy is out breathing. Sit like no shame to God. Here. Take it upstairs to Song. I'm busy watching MV. It will take a minute. You can watch later. Ar-sun, go help your Mom. Bring your brother some snacks. You're eating the whole store. Eating machine. When not sleeping, you either eat or get yourself lost. Hey! When you're done. Hurry back down. Don't bother him. He needs to concentrate. Next time use a pulley so I can watch MV in peace. Gotcha! It's "into my Eyes" MV. More like "into my Ass" for me. Song. - Den, open the door, quick! - Song. VDO game! Song. Ar-sun, go play somewhere else. Ar-sun, don't bother them. C'mon. Let's go downstairs. Let's go. Song, I have some food in the kitchen. If you and your friends are hungry, go eat there. Kids these days are so focus. Why the hell you speak Chinese with your Mom? We almost got caught. Here is the latest one. Hey Song! A little Austin Powers, eh? It's called "short, grand and handsome". Can't talk about it, huh? Gives you a hard-on? Like a rock. You bastard! I'm sorry. I didn't mean to. You bumped me and stepped on my cigarette! What if I punch on your face. And say I didn't mean it, what are you going to say? I'm asking you. If I hit you and say I didn't mean it. What are you going to say?! I told you I'm sorry. I didn't mean to. Asshole! If I hit your dad and I said I didn't mean it. What are you going to say? Bastard Kong! Asshole. Fatty, you get out. Son of a bitch. Enough. You're dead meat. Let's go. - I'll be back. - C'mon. Back off. Let's go. Hey Sayan. Thank you very much. Without you today I'd be dead already. You risk yourself for me. I don't know how to thank you. Don't mention it. We're classmates. If I don't help you, who else should I help? Most importantly, you're not wrong. But they got a knife! A Knife? So what? I believe you guys would do the same. I was just happened to be closer. You're right. I was about to attack them. I was mad at you beating me to Kong. I can figure now. Why you moved here in the last year of school. It doesn't end for sure. Do you realize what you've done? That asshole you kicked, his brother is a nasty pimp. He may get his revenge. Be careful. Don't let your guard down. They're sneaking dogs. You know sneaky dogs? Nice to meet you. Me too. Nice to meet you. Call me Lam. Lam. I'm so starving, man. Getting all excited with my new moves? But I'm not teaching you today. I'll teach later. Right now I want everybody... Go over what I had taught last time. Who still remember it, raise your hand. Don't be shy. There's someone who don't, but she can't speak. Because she's mute. I'm so mad. How dare you kid me! I'll pinch your skin off. How dare you kid me! I'll scratch your face off. Kids, if you now remember then. Pair up and come forward to me. C'mon kids. Come. Come. Come. Get in line. Get ready for a standard step. Prepare to start. Ms. Pretty and Mr. Handsome, come over here. Your friends are waiting, hurry up. One two three, touch. One two three, touch. One two... Hey, pretty pair, why did you stop? Don't like this song? C'mon dance. Well, if I ask and you don't answer, I'll take it as a yes. What happened to your arm? Husband hits you, right? That is a yes. Are you a psycho? When you don't get what you want, you abuse yourself? That is a yes. Or are you a hysteric? Have to abuse yourself to get... Let's drink. We don't drink straight. Let me introduce the girls here. Cherry. Molly. Mod. Panda. Apple. They are all lovely. Pick one, point one. If you're still not happy, get your ass somewhere else. They're the best ones around here. Can I come in? The door isn't locked. Have you got a girl? Wanna be my man? Why don't you take your clothes off? What are you waiting for? Want me to do it? I came from a broken family. Living with Grand Ma is all I can remember. She said I was born out of the bamboo. Kids at school always picked on me about parents. One day I came home asking Grand Ma. She said my dad was dead. Mom had to work to get me to school. She'd be back. I could only wait and wait. I don't understand. How is a kid with no parent funny to them? But there wasn't a day I didn't wait for my mom. Hey boys, are you sure you don't want it? You sure? When time is up, no refund, got it? Turn off the lights please. Grand Ma came to see me at school. Told me Mom was back and at the temple now. The monk said she's in a coffin. But can't open it because she's got contagious disease. I don't have her photo, not even one. By the time I got myself together, they almost cremated her. What are you trying to tell me? Singh, you have a good heart. I can feel it. I can feel the love in your family. I have enough. Don't go around the bush. Just tell me. I'm listening. You'll never understand a broken person like me. It's like teaching a blind to know red colour. If you don't understand her, you'll always look at her negatively. What if I do understand? It will be like how you feel with me now. I envy you. Too much fun left you speechless, huh? It's typical for the first timer. How was it, Song? I wanna go home. Go home and watch porn? Where's the money? You bitch! You wanna get hurt? Get lost. Walk away quietly. Go! It's for free again! Piece of shit. Tomorrow we'll go skating with Kanda. Eang and Noong-ning are going too. You're coming with us, yes? Don't think too much. Just come with us. So we can spend time together. You never go out with us. Just for once, all right? Come on. Please. Come with us. Okay, I'm going, but I can't stay long. All right. Let's go home. See you tomorrow. Hello everybody. Welcome to The Skate. Hey Singh. Let's roll. We don't have to wait for them. I'm dying to get out there. What is it, Song? I told you not to wait anymore. Let's roll. Just the two of us. Okay, you go. I'm staying here. What the hell is wrong with you? Messing up my mood. I'm counting on your pretty face, man. Hey Song, I'm thirsty. I go get some drink. Here is your drink, Singh! Singh, wait up. You're here too? I knew it. My right eye was jerking this morning. So the jinx is meeting this bitch here. Hey! Watch your mouth! This morning I prayed for you, you didn't get it? That's why you follow me here. Your friend isn't coming with ya? Who are you talking about? The Director General's daughter. She's here or not, what it has to do with you? Nothing at all. I'm just pondering. Haven't you noticed? This friend of yours is kinda strange. How many words has she talked to you so far? Has she ever laughed? Think about it. How well you know her? Where's she living? How many siblings has she got? Why did she move here? Do you know these things? That makes sense. She never tells us anything. Never joins us anywhere. She said she would come today and doesn't show up. Hey you. What Singh said is sensible. He wants us to be friends. Oh God. What a dork. Who wanna be your friend? I'm telling you. I'd rather hanging out with Mituna than you. Nasty pigs. I think you'd better find the answer for yourselves. What makes you hate her? If it's about what you just said. I think you guys have smaller heart than girls. And about Mituna, we can see to it ourselves. You stay out of this. What is it, Song? These bitches said I'm a nasty pig. Crazy bitches. That's totally not true. Hey! Who spilt coconut milk in my bathroom? I slipped and almost fall. If I'm paralysed, who will be responsible? Hey! How do you get all sweaty after a shower? This isn't soapy smell. You smell weird. What wrong with you guys? Hey Lam, who are those two boys? My friends. Why? They walk like gangsters. This is it. Who do you live with? My brother. Actually he's my cousin, my uncle's son. He studies at Ram University, third year now. Lam, you said you got some goodies for us? You wait here. Your shit is really strong. - Awesome. - I dig it, Motherfucker. You take it. I'm gonna burn your house. Motherfucker. Hey. Hey what, bastard? Can I ask you a favour? You all go with me. At this house, a whole family was killed. The new occupants have all moved out within 3 days. This place is very haunted. If you're scared. Let's come back another day. No. We are already here. There're so many of us. Nothing to be scared. But you have to promise me. No matter what happens. We must stick together and don't run. Understood? - Yeah. - And you? - Yeah. - And you? - Yeah. - And you? This room is where the slaughter took place. Hey! Don't run. Calm down. Calm down. Let's go. Na-mo-ta-sa Pa-ka-wa-to Ar-ra-ha-to.... Ar-ra-ha-to Sum-ma-sum-put-ta-sa. The ghost can pray! - Who are you? - I'm human. Why are you here? To see some ghosts. Ghosts are over at that house. There's only me here. Oh, I'm sorry. Let's go. Wrong house. Singh. It's past 1 0 o'clock already. Tunwa. Yes, Mom. Go wake your brother up. I have been calling him. Okay. Can you wake me up nicely? I'm not a spider web. I'd rather you hit my head. Watch it. You'll get what you ask for. Mom, he gets up now. Auntie. Neurosis medicine? In my hood, we call it crazy. No wonder, she looked at me so weird. Or maybe she's sadistic? Damn! Why? Or maybe she's hysteric? Or maybe You asshole, Pong! Why you have to say such a thing? I'm leaving. Bastard! I'm going too. It's because of you. Hey wait for me. Damn friends. All Left. Are you going out today? - Today? - Yeah, today. I have a new spot. It's hot. My brother has been there. - Hook me up with two? - Of course. Leave it to me. You prefer white and hot girl, right? Is Den coming with us? - I don't know. - Don't have to now, it's on new mag again. You look at her from top to toe. You like her, huh? You dare pair me up with shit, Pong? Stinky mouth. Thanks. Your friend isn't lonely anymore. Pong, you think they will talk? They might be mother and daughter. Finally they've found each other. But the daughter didn't greet her Mom. I'm mute and so what? Singh, come eat fried noodle. Where are you going? I'm leaving, not feeling well. Hey stop. Come back here. There. What are you waiting for? Wanna be in jail? Get them. If any teacher or student see Kanok. - report it to the Regulation Office, okay? - Yes sir. If any of you see Kanok or Kong. Report the Regulation Office immediately Students, back to lesson. Open page 36 and work on it. You told me you have not a friend, nobody You must have forgotten that you still have me When you're in a crowd, having people surrounded You never see me standing out When you heart is feeling down. I'll be down with you When you have your sad tears - I will be here to cry it out with you - Mom, let me help. - When you are happy, someday, - Get the trays in for me. Just know that I'm watching and admiring I'm sorry. I know just word isn't enough. But I have to say it. I want you to forgive me. Don't have to be now. I know it isn't easy not to be mad at me. I promise I won't do it again. I promise. La laa lun laaa laaa....Ia lun laa laa lun La laa lun laaa laaa...Ia lun laa laa lun Love is discovering It's the end. It's everything It's a dream, it's a truth It's a happiness when you're together Even it's hard, will keep going through Love, when it comes to you Through thick and thin, you'll never fear Your heart is suddenly lit up with hopes Being down and out, you can cope You only need that love in your heart When I have found you I have found the greatest love of all Please trust in me Don't let my dream crumble and fall I know love is hard to explain But true love lasts forever Never change from you I'm sorry. I'm so ashamed. I don't know how I did that to you. But what you saw isn't the real me. I swear. If I lie, let the thunder strikes me. I want to punch you so hard in the face. If I knew, I wouldn't have stopped you. I'd have let Mituna hit you to death. Kanda. Singha has apologized, hasn't he? And Mituna is okay with this? Not yet. She hasn't spoken a word to me. Anybody knows how to make her "not mad" anymore? Hey Mituna. You tell her mom now. Well... School is out for 1 5 days. My friends and I have this project. We'll take Mituna to treat children some lunch. And hand out educational materials to kids. At Kao Koh, Petchaboon province. Hey Singh, what does this mean? In Petchaboon, there're tamarinds. You have a pen and paper? Here it is. Lam, write it down on paper. And give it to her mom to read. You and me, we were good friends just yesterdays But now friendship is gradually fading away Being close's transformed it into one deep love It isn't wrong, is it? Cuz we know each other's heart I used to be sad, despair and lonely. You came to comfort, make me feel all right Through thick and thin, you never left me And then my heart has changed over time A friendly love is transformed It's got blurred and gone A new kind of love is born, covering all of my heart Do you want a hand? Here. I give you. I have no money. It's okay. It's free. I have plenty. You can choose what you like. Here. Pick some. Hey wait. Hey Kanda! Song, do you know that you've done wrong? I don't give a shit. I only know this is a wrong girl. Actually Kanda isn't bad at all. Pong, don't you tell anybody. Promise me. Mituna. I'm done setting up your tent. Anything else I can help you with? Don't stick up your nose if I don't ask you to. Piss off. If there's anything else I will snap my fingers. No thanks necessary. It's nothing really. Hey. Ancient belief says... If you see a falling star, make a wish and it'll come true. I wish all you guys happy. And you gals too. And for those haters. I wish you back to love. And for those who were kissing by the tent? Pong, nasty mouth!! When you wank in my bathroom, have I said a word? Hey, Pong bastard. I'm sorry. That's gross. Okay, since now we are all here. Anybody wants to have an open talk? Singh, you first. Of all the flowers in this world. I like Marigold the most. Yeah, sure. Marigold is your Mom's name. The flower I like the second most... I thought there was none. But being nave and didn't know any better. I have stepped on it. In my hood, they call you stupid. Until today I feel very sorry. And mad with how stupid I've been. From now on, I promise. I will bring it back to how it's used to be. I'll do everything I can. So the flower I love will be lively again... And stay that way forever. No matter how long it takes. I promise with you guys, my friends here. I won't give up. And I definitely won't break this promise. A little child heard a tale that had long been told Whoever catch a firefly and keep it under the pillow Will have a pleasant sleep, a dream of sparkling stars Of prince and princess, a dream that is oh so beautiful Lun lun laa lun laa laaa, Lun lun laa lun laa laaa, Lun lun laa laaa, Come on. Rearrange. You come over here. I'll be at the rim. Yeah, we're ready. Who did you left this space for? For Lam. Ready? ...1 ...2 ...3 What're you doing? I miss you. Hello. You brought Singha here? He's here to help. Have you eaten? I'm full. Let's stop by the corner and get something to eat. We just ate. Well, I just wanna talk. Crazy. Hey, easy with that! Catch. Hey! Sweep it other way, Den. Why do you like marigolds? The day my Dad got promoted to Director General. Mom and I were there with him. But on the way home. Dad had too much to drink and we had a car accident. Fortunately, Dad and I didn't get injured at all. But Mom... She won't be able to speak and hear anything again. After that... Dad left us. Your friends are nice. Hey! Let go, let go. Again, again. Got it? We're gonna miss the show! Good. Good. We almost get it. We'll keep this present as a memento. - Meet Mr. Pongpat in "This is Rock!". - Hooray! Don't move. Hold it still. Lam, where are you going? He is so hot. It's the truth that I can't deny I can only smile and wish you the best Wish you and him all the luck and happiness Live your life with no sorries. Hey!! Hold it still. - And I'll try to forget... - Why me? - I'll go this way. - No, this way. Why go there? Everybody is over here! - Open your eyes and see! - I don't care. I'm going. No, this way. - Just go! - No way. I'm so good. I made it. - I made it, man. - You're awesome. You rock. Better put your pants on now. Here. In my new found true love, there is your heart I can only keep it to myself Can't let you know. I don't wanna get hurt Can you tell me who is your true love? Not too much to ask, isn't it? 'Cause my heart is yearning from... A wilting love but I'll keep you here in my heart till... You know it well and understand Just want you to know Hey! That's Porntip Miss Universe. - So beautiful. - Yeah she is. There're so many journalists. I'm so glad she won the crown. Look at her. There's not much time before your final exam. Anybody who has questions about any subject. Better clear them up. Because if you fail, there's no second chance. This examination... It's one of the biggest steps in your life. To go forward in life, you need to take those steps. So remember. Concentration, focus, determination. Practice, enthusiasm to learn. Keys to keep yourselves on track. But what I really want from you... ...is not the good grades. But I want you to be a good person. A good person in your family. A good person in our society. What's wrong with you? Your dick stinks. Stinks your aunty's dick! Your aunty has a dick? My aunty is a tomboy. Pissing your jokes out, eh? - Lam. - What is it? Thank you very much about Mituna. I haven't done anything. You're the one who did it all. I love you very much, man. In my life, I've never been told I'm loved. Except my granny. Hey Lam, I love you too. Bastard! It stinks! You frighten me. You always do it like this. Let's buy some booze to drink at the pier. It's my treat. Let's go. I have a brand new game to show you. I'll teach you after we finish the drink. - What game is it? - Singh, you're gonna love it. - I'm telling ya. - It sounds exciting. Where's the booze? You carry it, no? Gotta be with you. Yeah. I must have left it in the shop. - I'll go get it. - No, it's me, I'll go. - You guys go ahead. - Yeah, Hurry. - I'm the farthest. It's so obvious. Watch! - Bastard. Why Lam takes so long? It's alright. I'll go get him. Hey, here he comes. Now what? You come over here and take a look. This is what you call far. Hey, where're you going? Let's talk. Are you staring for trouble? You really want it? You hit my friend! You dare mess with me? Bring him up. Lam. Lam. Lam. Mituna! It's no rush. You can give it back on the last exam day. You said you'll be strong. Everybody feels sorry and sad. If you fail the exam, what you think Lam would feel? Look who's talking. You're just as bad. Your dad wants you and your mom to go live with me. He's selling this house. After the final exam... I will come pick both of you to my house upcountry. If your mom doesn't see this house, she might feel better. A special investigation on the Hit man gang massacre has been set. Hit man's relatives say the police over-react. After being such a big news on the front page. All the officers involved in this case, are now being investigated by the committee. The victims' families blame the police for over-reacting. Wow, the table is turned once again. What's going on? - Well... - I... You first. I have to go upcountry with mom for a few days. When? Today. Are you okay? It guess it's something bad. You don't have to tell me now. Focus on your exam. After that we can talk about it. Hey Singh. Singh, come here. Aww, come here. Have you eaten? No. Let's go eat some noodles. Come on. Stay focus and do your best. I wish you good luck. See you on the exam result day. Got lots of things to tell you. And I'll give you the friendship book. Promise. Bastard. I draw a cat for you. It's cool. Singh, let me circle your tits. Song, stop! It's ticklish. Hey, here comes "The Elegant Sumos". Hello everybody. A Thai word of the day, for today... We present you "Thai Mung". "Thai Mung" is an uncommon noun. And the definition of it is... A person who's so eager to know, to see. So much to know what they shouldn't. I guess he's gonna be rich and famous in the near future. That's correct! What's going on? Dad's got transferred. Give us a hand, will you? Singh, let's go drink at Den's place. I stole my father's booze. You go ahead. I'm waiting for Mituna. See you there. Don't mess around. When your dream girl comes check the exam result... and she doesn't see you here, she surely goes home. You come with us first and go see her later. Come with us. I've already called Lam's spirit here. If you're late, he might get mad and go incarnate! Oh...I'm sorry. Let's go, Singh. Here is for Lam. You have to drink it for him. Hey, wait, wait, wait. Why don't you give it to Lam? I think his spirit is around here. I can feel it. Asshole! Is that a mouth or a foot yapping? Don't call him out. I'll drink it. Cheers. For Lam. Hey you, stay still. Don't run. Come over here. C'mon. Why are you sitting here? Waiting for a friend. And you have to sit in the rain? You got him? Yes. Hey, this is Senior sergeant Mesa's son. - Hello. - Hello. What are you doing here? Haven't you moved? Lieutenant. We found him hiding in the pond. - Sarge. Go take a look. - Yes sir. - Piag, take the car to the front. - Yes sir. Go, follow them. Okay! One last shot and we all go home. Hey Singh. Singh. I know what you're thinking. If she comes, she'd be here by now. She isn't coming, man! Think about it. Jazz and Kanda never met her once. What makes you think you will? If she wanted to see you, it wasn't that hard. She could just come to school and ask me or Kanda. And she would get your address in a jiff. I think she chose not to see you. Why doesn't she wanna see me? Ahh, she might have been... married, you know? If she had, I'd be happy for her. I just wanna know why she didn't keep her promise. I think this is it. The reason is she's ashamed of her ugly husband. He's short. He's black. She now has dozens of kids and fat as pig. She doesn't want you to know. That's more like you. Listen. I'm not talking shit. I think, she's dead. That's SHIT. Hey, how about this. Anybody here Mituna hasn't signed his friendship book? Friendship book is such a small deal. That's not it. You're right. Friendship book is a small deal. But if she didn't sign it, it's a big deal. This is my team. Please tell them details... As much as you can. - Much appreciated. - Yes. This way please. Who wants to be on TV, raise your hand! Oh there're many of you. Including this little one? You can give them candies now. Candies for everybody! I haven't seen you for a long time. Have you been doing well? I'm fine. How about you, Singh? I'm fine, Ma'am. How about Mituna? How is she? Remember you promised me, when we meet again... You'll give me something. I never thought I would ever see your face again. From now on, I will show my face to you for the rest of my life. Everybody misses you, you know? If they knew you were here, They would be so happy and got to see you here. But I won't tell them now. Let's wait until you get better and we will go see them together. Why do you like marigolds? I like them because you like them. Looking for what I promised to give you? Ahh, friendship book. Does it really matter to you? I wanna know what you wrote. Miss Patient, it's getting late, get some sleep. I have something for you. It's okay. You can give me tomorrow. It's so late, you'd better get to sleep. How about this. I have so many things to tell you. Do you want to hear? But you have to promise that.. You will listen till it ends. Because it's a very very long story. Might take 1 0 years to finish it. I'll tell you the reason I take this job. Because I have a chance to travel around the country. Everywhere I go, I wish I would run into you. But there is no face that looks like yours. You should be proud your face is unique. And something tells me that... We will meet again. And now I... I finally have found you. Mituna asked me to give you this when she's gone. Singha, do you know... The first day I moved to that school. I met the most important person in my life. I'd better go, Ma'am. It's you. You might not notice that the woman you helped that day. Was my mother. I haven't thanked you. Thank you. You know, that marigold you gave to my Mom. I have kept it all the time. Now you don't have to ask me again why I like marigolds. See you on the exam result day. I have an important thing to tell. Singha. Remember the first exam day? I told you I had to go upcountry. The truth is I had to move there. But I got no guts to tell you. Thought I would tell you on result day. I'm going to see my friends. Then meet you later at the foundation. On result day I went to see you at school. But you weren't there. So I ran to your house. But when I got there, nobody was home. Then I thought... You would never leave without saying goodbye. Maybe we missed each other at school. I ran to the park, in case you were there. Since it was the place we like to go. I waited for a long time and thought you wouldn't come. Or you might be waiting at school. I was so afraid we didn't get to say goodbye. I decided to run back to school again. But I didn't make it. I'm sorry. Singha, I have something to tell you. Why are you sitting here? Waiting for a friend. Do you have to sit in the rain? You got him? Yes. Hey, this is Senior sergeant Mesa's son. - Hello. - Hello. What are you doing here? Haven't you moved? Lieutenant. We found him hiding in the pond. - Sarge. Go take a look. - Yes sir. - Piag, take the car to the front. - Yes sir. Go, follow them.
