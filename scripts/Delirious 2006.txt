You're just pissed off at your dad - and you're taking it out on me! - Whoa, watch out, Oprah. Here comes Dr. Homeless. Hey, I know about some things. Okay? I went through some pretty crazy shit with my fuckin' parents. My mother cut me, man. She came at me with a steak knife. How do you think I got this? I went fuckin' crazy. Jesus. I knew it. You killed her. Les, I didn't fuckin' kill my mother. I love my mother. I just can't be around her. She can't be around me. I kept looking for something that I'm not going to get, that she can't give me. You're not going to get it, Les. It's a dead-end street. You sit around waiting for someone else to tell you you're okay. I mean, you're okay. You don't need it, Les. You took a really good picture, Les, no matter what your old man says. - He threw it in the garbage. - Yeah, but so what? You got things going on, right? I mean, we got to bring your book around. We're going to go to, what'd you say? Nike, Calvin Klein. I never said Calvin Klein. Think big, get big. Right? I'm sorry, Toby. I didn't mean to go off on you. Whatever. Rule number one... friends is friends. That's good, man. - You like that one? - Yeah. That's a good one. You're learning. Why don't you go take your walk? Go ahead. No, I think I'll just watch some TV. Go to sleep. Hey. I know what we can do. What? Headshots! Hey, take it easy! All Access. All Access. Him too. Show him the thing. Turn it around. See that. Thank you. Jesus Christ. There's nothing but B-list in here. Alright, I got to go find Trudy. Stay right here. Keep an eye out for those goody bags. Goody bags. It's so tempting when I feel so empty and I'm sitting here all alone. But I will fight it until I can find a sweet love of my own. You take your love and shove it. You can stick it where the sun don't shine. You take your love and shove it. You better listen, boy, 'cause I ain't lying,' lying, lying, anymore. You see I'm still looking for my true love, a boy, that won't fade away. I'm still looking for my true love so I won't have to say you take your love and shove it. Demo from NTV. How you doing girl? Wait. Hold on. Hold up. You are looking hot. Thank you. Thank you very much. So you got to tell me some stuff here. You got a lot going on these days. You got the world premiere video. Your parents are suing you, I heard. I am super, super busy. Plus, Mystique and Jace are hitting it up pretty hard. - Is this like a mega-bummer for you? - I am really, really happy for him. And I'm trying to stay strong and I thank God for my music which will always be my first love. And who's the little studmuffin you got here next to you? Oh, this... This is... I'm Toby. - Toby. Alright. - Yeah. He's my hook-up tonight. Isn't he hot? He's straight up slamming, dude. Okay, bye. Peace up, y'all. Toby! What the fuck?! Excuse me. - I'm All Access. - You're not. That's a yellow card. You need a green card to get in here. Where do you get a green card? Try City Hall. Come on, studmuffin! Yes of course she's going to be there. we're going to see you there. I can't believe you fixed the jacuzzi. It was just a loose wire on the pump. Stupid hotel. I told them to fix it like a month ago. How come you live in a hotel? Taxes. I write it off. Plus I never have to make the bed. I wish I had a camera. Don't. I hate it when people take my picture. - Sorry. - It's okay. You probably wouldn't understand, being homeless. The worst are the paparazzi though. They just don't leave you alone, even when you're going through something really painful. He broke my heart. - Who? That guy? Jace guy? - He said that... He said that my eyes were too far apart. What? That's... People are different. That's why people are beautiful. Do you think that I'm beautiful? Are you kidding me? I think that you're the most beautiful girl I've ever seen. And then all of a sudden I'm in the Jacuzzi with her. And I fixed the Jacuzzi because it was broken. It was like broken for like weeks in this nice hotel. We just kind of hung out there. We were in our underwear. We didn't have sex or anything but we really like... I don't know. I really connected. We really connected. You connected? In your underwear? Well, I mean... I am so totally fuckin' thrilled for you, Toby. Hey, you know what? Look what I got you. I got you a present. Look. - What's that? - They're olives. I figured we could put them in the trunk with the martini glasses. You know? You just take a toothpick, put an olive in, you put it in a martini glass and all the sudden you look like a ritzy guest. - Like a what? - Like a guest. Like a guest? Like a ritzy guest!? That's what I look like?! Toothpicks?! You sneak backstage without me! You hang out with sexy chicks and superstars all night and you come home with toothpicks!? - Are you, retarded?! - No. No, you're just an ungrateful bastard! I'm grateful! Man, come on. I gave you a job. I gave you a place to sleep! Les man, I'm grateful. You know what hurts the most? What did I say about De Niro? - You said... - I said I would take you with me. Didn't I say that? I would take you with me! Yeah. And what do you do? The first chance you get you fuckin' leave me. - Like I'm a peon! - Les, I'm sorry. - What the fuck?! No! - I'm fuckin' sorry. No! You can't apologize for this, man. Look, I got caught up. You got caught up. That's bullshit, man! That's bullshit! Forget it! - Just get out! Go! It's over! - Don't do that. Look, how can I make it up to you? Whatever you want. Whatever you need, man. Just tell me, I'll do it. I want to make it up to you. What hotel is she at? What? What hotel is she staying at? I don't know. She's staying at some hotel uptown. I don't remember. You just spent the night with this chick that you're puppy shit in love with and you don't know the hotel she's at?! I don't remember. I guess I am fuckin' retarded. I don't remember. Wow. Galantine Photo. Can I help you? Let me see. Who's calling? Hold on. You're lucky. It's her! Les. Jesus Christ... Hello? Hey, homeless. What'd you do, run out on me? No, you fell asleep on me. How're you feeling? Oh, I don't know yet. I got your note. It was very sweet. Thanks. I had such a good time. Me too. So what're you doing tonight? Tonight? I don't know. Well, it's my birthday and I'm having a little party. I thought maybe you'd like to come by. Wow. That'd be great. Okay, great. Do you think maybe I could? Do you think maybe I could take someone with me? Like a date? No, not a date, just a friend. You know? Oh, yeah. Sure. Alright, I'm going to go back to bed. So I'll see you later. Okay. Goodbye. Yes! Good job. What? Nothing. Oh. Okay, I won't go. I just thought I heard somebody say they wanted to make up something up to somebody. That's all. - Les, man... - Forget it. Les... I'm not going. Have a good time. Have a good time! It's huge. - You should see the bathtub. - Really? Yeah. I don't know about this jacket. Why not? No, it looks good on you. This was my dad's jacket. - Really? - Yeah. Don't worry. - What's the matter? You nervous? - A little bit. How's my hair look? - It looks good. - Yeah? You didn't even look. Yeah, I'm looking. It looks good. Les, I don't think we should take any pictures. Why not? - I'm just saying... - You're a professional now? I'm just going to take a few shots. No, I'm just saying it's her birthday party. Please don't take any pictures. Alright. You know what? You're absolutely right. I'm sorry. It's not even going to leave my pocket. You're not going to? I promise you I will not take a picture. Alright? Don't worry. Don't worry. Hey, homeless. - You look beautiful. - Thank you. - This is my friend Les. - Hi, Les. Thanks for coming. - Happy birthday. - Thank you. Come on in. Meet some people. This is Elvis. We're working on a musical together. Wow. What musical? - About the life of Brittany Spears. - Brittany Spears. I'm thinking Tennessee Williams, only not so gay. Imagine Streetcar with K'harma in the Brando role. - Brando. - On ice. - Want to go open presents? - Okay. - I'll be right back, Elvis. - Sounds great to me. - This is Les, by the way. - Pleased to meet you. I just want to say I'm a really big fan. You've got a strong shake there, Les. You're a musician, right? I've seen you play? Where have I seen you play? What? Les. What's going on? - Are you alright? - I don't know. I don't know, Toby. What's up? - I'm freaking out! - Why? I can't talk! You're okay. I sounded like a fuckin' idiot. Les, you didn't, man. Calm down. That's Elvis Costello. Alright? That's Elvis Costello out there. So what? He's just a guy, like you said. Remember? Equal. We're equal. - Les, you're cool. - That's right. we're all equal.

Stop taking my fuckin' picture! Behave yourself. - What are you doing? - Just taking a few shots. - Are you a paparazzi?! - He's taking my picture. - No, I'm a licensed professional. - He's just messing around. He's my assistant. You brought a paparazzi to my party?! Call security. Give me that fuckin' camera! - Right here. - Sorry. Cheeks. - Muy bonita. Excellent. - Thank you, Mr. Les. Why don't you let him make you a batch? These are excellent. I asked you not to take any pictures. I know, and I'm sorry. OK? I got a little excited. Cheeks, why don't you make the kid a batch? I don't want any, Cheeks. Don't make me any. You said that you wouldn't take any pictures. I asked you and you said, "I'm going to..." - You want the pictures?! Here. - What are you doing? - Here's the pictures! Alright? You happy? Elvis frigging Costello, K'harma Leeds. Down the drain. You know how much money that is? You know how much money I could've got for that? I didn't tell you to do that. - Well, I did it. - You did that on your own. Now do you see how serious I am? Let me tell you something. Jesus, Les! I'm trying to tell you something as a friend. Okay? That chick is not for you. Okay? Why? Because every time she looks at you you know what she sees? A good-lookin' nobody with his nose pressed up against the glass. I know that hurts. Okay? And I'm sorry. But Rule number one, man... know where you belong. I'm not saying they're any better than us, 'cause they're not. I am through following these people around. I'm sick of it. She threw us out of that party like we were peons. It was her birthday party. It was a personal thing. She trusted me, man. Just listen to me? Tomorrow I'm going to take my book and hit all the agencies. And you're coming with me. Alright? We're partners now. Me and you. From now on we're going where the lights are green. You know what else we can do? I'll get your headshots printed up. Alright? And I'll call De Niro. I'll slip him a headshot. Don't worry. We're going to have a lot of fun. You don't need that other shit. It's just you and me now. It's going to be great. Well, what hurts? My stomach. Well what hurts about it? It just hurts. What kind of hurt? Les, I don't know. I don't feel good. Alright? - Jesus. - OK. I just... thought you might want to come with me today, to see how the whole agency game is played. I do. I can't. Alright. I'll bring you back some soup. I'm going to be gone a couple of hours so if you want to watch TV that's OK. Just don't mess around with the computer. Okay? I won't. Alright. Hope you feel better. Fuck! Well, Les... Fuck! Photo... Fuck. Sick, my ass! You better not be on my computer! What the fuck?! Toby?! Blaine. Blaine, I'm scared. Don't worry, Robbyn. You're super-safe with me. Nobody's going to mess with you. Please, don't! I can help you! I know you've killed 10 people but I know you don't want to be a serial killer. Let me help you. I want to be your friend. Friend? What's a friend but somebody sitting around waiting for a chance to talk about themselves? Is that the line? Cut! No, it isn't, Robbyn, but come on. If there's a change you got to go with it. Alright? I mean, where'd you go to school, NYU? What kind of shit is this? Stay in character. Don't break the fourth wall. Okay. Toby, excellent. I like what you're doing. - Keep it up. - Thanks. - You alright? - Yeah. Oh crap! we got to reset the whole knife gag with Blaine. Come on, get in there and change it! Quick! Again! Let's go! I swear to god, cold coffee one more fuckin' time and you're out of here! - I told you. - You were right. He's incredible, right? Where did this kid come up with this stuff? He's awesome. It's the real thing. Come on, look at that face That's the close-up. We need to go tight like that. Right? That's the close-up you need. There you got a show. Hi, I'm Toby. I play "Toby". I mean, I used to be homeless so I think that's why they picked me for this job. So I know "Toby" pretty well. I've had some experiences with violence but right now I'm just trying to go where the lights are green. It's a reality series show about a serial killer who's also a homeless kid. Megahip cast because all the people in it are who they are. Like Life. Like OJ. Did that really happen or was it just an old reality show? Think about that. The challenge of the casting was finding people who are what they are but who also have that star quality. Our lead, forget about it. He really has it. He has such a bright, bright future. Hi, I'm Toby. I play "Toby". I mean, I used to be homeless so I think that's why they picked me for this job. Right now I'm just trying to go where the lights are green. You know? Christ, now he's stealing my lines! I should sue him for plagiarism. At least get a writing credit. I'm his manager. You could tell me. What's the offer? He's tied to Slice for another 3 months. Can you hold for a second? Hello? No. No, Premiere does not get the profile unless he has a full page. Okay? You got that? Call me back. Alright. Hold on for a second. Hello? No, that's T-O-B-Y, no E. Yes, he's 20 years old. The scar is real. He got it in Central Park, fighting off a pack of wild dogs. OK? Thank you. Randolyn. Yes. No, listen, baby, the offer is fine. Alright? The only problem I'm having is the female lead. I'm sure she's completely delightful but her star is nowhere near Toby's orbit. Tell Ridley we appreciate the offer. We'll consider it. And that's plus 10 %. Thanks, baby. Bye. Cheers. Did have a nice shower? Yeah. Your hot water is amazing. - Yeah? - Yeah. It really is. Look at you, your skin, it's all tingly. I fixed your shower head. Did you? Now I told you, you can't keep walking around my apartment without any clothes on. There are windows. I knew you would clean up good. Look how beautiful you are. K'harma designed the scent all by herself. She went to the lab. She picked out all the different smells. She came up with the bottle, thanks to you guys. The colors... The name, Instant K'harma. Which is so great. - Suis generis. It's K'harma. - It evokes desire. And sexiness. Excuse me. What are you doing here? I came to smell you. So where's Mystique? I love the single. It's hot. I know. I know it's hot. It's not about you, you know. I know. I don't think about you anymore either. You look beautiful, baby. Really beautiful. - I do miss you, baby. - Really? Every day, every night. Especially at night. How about you? You miss me? No. Not even just a tiny bit? No. I knew you did, baby. Yeah? I wish this guy would shut the fuck up. Toby! Will you just take this guy? He won't even shut up. He's been calling for a week. No, I don't want to take it. You have to take this call, man. I am going to freak out. He's the most annoying human being I've ever met! Yeah? Hey. How you doing? Is that really you? Oh my God. What do you want? I'm just calling to say hi, man. I mean, I saw you on TV. Wow. You look great. What the fuck do you want, Les? You're fuckin' harassing everybody. OK, look, I just... think maybe we should get together. You know? Try and work this out. Because it's like you said, man... Rule number one Friends is Friends. No, rule number one, rule number one you lied to me, Les. Rule number two... you're a fuckin' paparazzi. Don't say that. That's what you are. You think you're different? That's what you are, Les. You're a fuckin' paparazzi. - Paparazzi. - Alright. Alright. Watch this. You sneak around and you take pictures of people and then you lie about it. You fucked the whole thing up, Les. You think I'm a paparazzi? Okay watch this. I'm going to delete the whole thing. Okay? Here I go. Alright? Okay. Yeah. You're deleting them. I did it. I swear to God! They're gone! Like I'm going to believe you. I could believe you now, right? Because right now you're telling the truth. Right? You tell me you believe me or I'm going to fuckin' stab myself in the throat! I got a knife to my throat right now! Alright look, Les. Calm... Look, just calm down. Les, calm down. Okay? Just tell me you believe me! Look just calm down! Calm down! I believe you. I believe you. Alright? I believe you. Thank you. Look man, you fuckin' locked me in your house. Hey, are we going to focus on the negative or can we move on to the positive? Alright? Come on. I was just calling to say how happy I am for you. You're doing great. And I started you off, isn't that crazy? You'd never would have met that casting chick if it wasn't for me. Are you still there? Yeah. Look how about if we just get together and have a beer? Alright? What do you say? You know? We'll go to Cheeks and we'll have a cup of coffee? Alright? No. Toby? You're such a totally awesome guy, Toby. Wow. Thanks. Ever since Blaine died you've taught me so much about being homeless. It's kind of beautiful in its own way. Yeah. It's got its ups and downs. I was going to say ins and outs. Cut! Cut! Cut! What, Corey?! I'm going with it like you said. Yeah, but come on! Is this after-school porno? - Is it! - No. Look. - Tell him how you really feel. - I'm trying. Be real for once. Just this one time. Okay? Be real. I'm sorry I yelled at you. All right? Tell him. Go. Let go of my hand. Keep rolling. Go. I love you, Toby. I love you so much. Yeah, I was pretty surprised when Robbyn said that. I mean, I think she's really pretty and fun but... my true feelings are for someone else. Someone I met a while ago who became very special to me and I love her. She's a singer. I met her at the Music Awards. Hey, baby. What're you doing, sitting in here all by yourself? I'm just thinking. About me? No. - Why? - You know why. Trust me, babe. I'm not going to hurt you again. - I love you. - I know but... I just can't stop thinking about all the things we used to do. Yeah, I was pretty surprised when Robbyn said that. But my true feelings are for someone else. She's a singer. I met her at the Music Awards. - Remember how I turned you on, babe? - Don't! She was really nice to me and I let her down. And I know she'll probably never forgive me. I would like her to know that I'm sorry and... I know that... I wouldn't love anyone as much as I love her. I love you, K'harma. I love you. Alright, can we stop now? Please. Okay. Toby. - I'm sorry. - How could you do that to me?! You know how fuckin' humiliating that was?! - I didn't mean for that to happen. - You didn't mean?! Shut the fuck up! You're such a dick! I'm sorry. You've been so nice to me. I've been so 'nice' to you! I've been so 'nice' to you! How nice? No, you've been more than nice to me. I'm sure I have been more than nice. What exactly do you mean? What exactly do you mean by that? I mean you're a really fuckin' special woman. I'm such a fuckin' special woman. Please. And I'll never forget what you've done for me. It's just not... Look, it's just... - What? - She's a little bit more... She's a little bit more what? I don't know. - And you're a little bit more... - What? I'm a little more 35 , and she's a little more 18 with a Barbie doll ass!? No, you're putting words in my mouth. That's not what I'm saying. That's exactly what you're saying, Toby! Why don't you just call a spade a spade? Listen, I never wanted to hurt you. - Well. - I don't want to hurt you. Just humiliate me? Look, I'll pack my stuff and I'll go. Okay? I'll get out of here. Whatever you want. I want you to be happy. That's what I want right now. So I'll pack everything up and I'll get out of here. I'll find a place. It's fine. Just stay here until you find some where else. Really? You sure? Yeah. Stay in the back room. Alright. I'll move my stuff into the back room and we'll just be like living together. Be like little roommates. Like friends. Whatever. Let's go make up your bed. Welcome back. This is Nikki Blake. Well, awards season is upon us and already hundreds of new films and stars are vying for those precious statues... I can't concentrate with the TV on. What concentrate? You pick up the card, you throw it down. A monkey could play this game. "Slice of Life" badboy, Toby Grace made television history last night by broadcasting his love for reigning pop diva K'harma. Sources close to the two are keeping mum but it was evident at this post-awards party that sparks were beginning to fly. Hey, that's Feldman's photo. Are we playing cards or what? Yeah, we're playing. For teenage fans outside the Slice studios in New York, the romance meter was off the charts. It was the most romantic thing I've ever seen! I love you, Toby! I don't care if you're homeless! As for the TV Romeo, he's keeping any further confessions close to the heart. I mean, I appreciate. But I wasn't trying to be romantic. When you love someone you just got to go with the flow. Oh, that's original. AT caught up with the object of his affections at her Manhattan hotel. All I can say is I'm really, really touched. Wow. Good for Toby. That's great. Why is that great? He was always a nice kid. Really? He's a jerk. What? Why do you say that? Because I know him. Come on, I lived with him right here. You know what he is? He's a backstabbing ungrateful leech. No. Really? Oh, my God. I could tell you stories, Ricco. I'll tell you what he did. He broke into my computer. Broke into your computer? What was he looking for? I don't know. Bank records, account numbers. You know? Personal stuff. Deeply personal. He always seemed like a nice kid. Why do you keep saying that? Because he did. He seemed like a nice kid. - I just told you he wasn't. - I know. I guess I just liked him. A really, really nice kid. That's it! what the fuck is wrong with you, man?! Get out! Get your cards and get out! I never seen you like this. You to chill, bro'. Why you be bugging? Why I be bugging? why can't you stop talking about Toby this, Toby that!? "Toby's a nice kid! Blah blah blah. Feldman's photo." Man, if you love the kid so much why don't you marry him?! - Just get out. - Was I talking about him that much? No, just every fuckin' second! Goodbye, Ricco. Nice having you. - You're wrong, man. - Yeah, I'm wrong. Where's that camera I gave you? I still got it. Thanks, Dad. Thanks for reminding me, because I got something coming up. Something I could really use it for. Someone I know is just dying to get his picture taken. He used to be a friend of mine. Okay. You reach out to a guy. You try to apologize. You say you're sorry, just trying to connect on a basic human level and what does he say? He says 'no'. No. Mr. Big TV Star. He doesn't even want to meet you halfway. Fine. What goes around comes around, my friend. Rule number one... You don't mess with Les. As simple as that. You reap what you sow and you are what you eat. Let's see what we got here. Listen, when get inside we go to E! first then Access Hollywood, then Ew. And it is absolutely critical we get that shot with Clooney and del Toro. Yeah, yeah, yes? Hey, it's Gabi. We're going to get out first. What do you mean, you're going to get out? No. Toby gets out first. No, Dana, K'harma's going to get out first. She going to get halfway up - and then Toby's going to get out. - Exactly. Jesus. No, Gabi. Toby gets out first. Then she gets out when he's a third of the way up. Where is he? Which car is he in? Would you goddamn hurry up and get in front of them! - Fuckin' shit! God dammit! - For fuck's sake! Don't let them in. Do not let them get in first. Dana, Dana? Guess what? Cut the shit. No, Gabi, you cut the fuckin' shit. Her last album moved ten million units. Yes. Plus foreign. Oh really? well, he happens to be the lead in a $90 million movie. Why don't we just get out together? Shut up. She's the celebrity endorsee for Nova Cola, domestic and international including Taiwan. Fine. She'll get out and then he's going to get out when she's a quarter of the way up. Love you, mean it. It's so much better that you get out second. It's much classier. It's much better. - Yeah. I don't care. - No. You should care. It's big. It means something. You have to enjoy this moment. It's everything we've been working for. - Get your coat on. - Come on. Do a little of this. - Are you ready, Byron? - Yeah. Alright, let's go. K'harma! Hey, homeless.
