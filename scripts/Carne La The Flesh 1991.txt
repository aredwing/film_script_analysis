My dad was head of a local socialist group We had to steal money from him to buy my communion suit. No one should be denied the 1st communion! Where are you going? Come here. Don't touch anything. - They are made of rubber. - Yes, they are... ...but we'd better stay away. - You must be joking. Who do you think you are scaring? Who? Well done, dad. Tougher than Tarzan. Now you can't say that I'm afraid I was afraid.. of those.. A real dinosaur, was tall as a 30-storey building. Daddy, I have to tell you a secret. I have thrills. Mom wants to take me to the doctor. - Real thrills? - Yes, thrills. - And sex? - Dad, don't be obscene. Obscene? Where do you pick up such words? I really wish to know. What a lovely headdress. I just hope it's in the catalogue so you can make a copy. Headdress? This is not a headdress... This is the skeleton of a man discovered in the Cavillon cave, near Menton, in France. Dad, will you buy me a Coke? A Coke?! What kinds of places is your mother taking you to? To learn karate! Come. Dad, you have to solve my problem. Tell her I want to take the 1st communion! If not, I'll kill myself. All tragedians in family, eh? Why won't you let your kid make his 1st communion? - Why are you shouting? - Hush, you! No one should be denied the first communion. - Who is it? - We have to talk. Yes, about money. It's been 2 months since... Not with you. Put me through to the dog. Yes, the dog. Giovanni? Yes, I'm waiting for you downstairs. Call the hyena on the phone. Shut up, idiot. If you don't send the dog down, the kids are staying with me. Dad, you can't steal kids just like that. Good God, I'm having a fever. Send the dog down! You dirty, ugly slut! Don't shout. The neighbours are listening. Mom is driving you crazy. She's a civil servant. Not an artist like you. Giovanni! Say hi to your little brothers. This one bites. The hyena told you to bite me? Go with him... Because I don't know... Get dressed and go with him An unbelievable thing The Marines entered the hemicircle armed with guns. All UN representatives were ordered to lay down with their pants off. The UK representative, who offered resistance received a hard blow in the face. The Italian representative immediately took side with the Marines.. Doctor? Hello. It's Paolo. Is this a good time to call? Just a second. It's about this... I've spent an enjoyable afternoon I would say. Rather quiet. I've been with kids. I saw the dog again. He's got a deep affection for me as always. A short quarrel with the hyena, but nothing to worry about. I came back home. Prepared something to eat. Bread... No, not bread. Brioches with milk. I can't get enough of brioches with milk. I could eat just that all my life. All of a sudden, without the slightest warning by no reason altogether Arhythmia. So, the question I'm asking you is this: Why? That hyena.. won't let the kid make the 1st communion. What a bitch! She still thinks we are living in the times of Stalin. Don Camillo and Peppone. Mom, are you proud of your son? I took a 2h long nap. Now I'm going to work, all happy. She's not letting him make the 1st communion. Remember the beating you took? Paolo... You have to talk to Nicola, tonight. You must tell him straight out If he doesn't undergo that surgery tomorrow morning at 11... Wasn't it already arranged? No, he changed his mind. You know how he's like. He won't listen to me. I can say whatever I want but... - We have to talk. - My friend. I calmly observe the others fooling themselves. Lenin got removed from the Red Square. A bunch of people profaning graveyards. The spiders must have eaten his legs. The body, damn it, was made of garnished papers. I don't know, I was eating. I wanna show you something. The blondie over there. - So what did you eat today? - Bread with milk. Look at Giovanna. Horny Giovanna. And she's a real marvel. What legs she has. - Can I kiss them? - You're tickling me. Bread and milk. Did you put a bran to ease the transit? Why should you care If I shit or not? I shit, you shit he shits, we shit.. Stop shitting us! You'd better think of your own transit. To the hereafter. What's this story about not going to the clinic to get operated? And you come here to provoke with your bran talk? You decided to shit on your brother? I'm not shitting I'm going to the Galapagos. To a simple place. I'm going with you. First, you gotta get cancer too. I'm the pianist. I'll dedicate this evening to you. I'll be waiting for you down there. Tomorrow, you'll go to the clinic. Yes, I'll take you there by kicking your ass. At 11 am. Don't be late. I'll give you the Galapagos. I'll go to the Galapagos I'm going all alone. I'm leaving you all. I'm going all alone. Good evening all. - How are you? - Good. - Are you hot? - We're burning. More enthusiasm More enthusiasm. She's my mistress. She'd like to make love with Francesca but it doesn't turn me on anymore. I don't like this song. Do you know "Paper flowers?" Yes, I do. I even saw the movie, at Paris. At the Ursulines. Very nice movie. But I don't have the score. I don't know it by heart. I adore everything that's Indian. Have you ever been in India? Unfortunately, never. But I believe that sooner or later... I'll go. India is a spiritual land. No need to go. It's everywhere, Bartali! - Bartali? - Yes! A bunch of roses will please her but also the sound of cellophane But a beer is even better On a sticky day like this I'm sitting at the top of a curbstone Thinking about my stuff Between 2 bikes - the silence If you look at me this way, I will die. Such a path in my sandals What trips Bartali must have done That sad nose like an uphill Your eyes are sad too. I had an abortion 15 days ago. Anyway, I feel happier now. Remember that I'm the wife, and you're just his mistress. Then go. - Can you help me out? - No. I've brought you a cup of chocolate, I know you like it. Nicola only talks about going to the Galapagos. You need to persuade him to have that surgery. Pause! Not when I'm working! I forgot. My name is Francesca. Paolo. Oh, my God. Like in Dante: Paolo and Francesca "Love, that releases no beloved from loving.. " I bought shoes worth All with ultra-high heels. My guru wanted them flat, but I want to look good. Your guru? Saynanda. I met him on a plane One day when his private jet had broken down. He and his master have centres of Tantrism all over the world. Saynanda? What does he look like? Old, tall, white beard... fire in his eyes? No, He's so cute. He's 22. and a look that gives out a physical glow. What a guy! Ladies and gentlemen Tonight... My dear friend. Farid the Great! For you. Farid, the one and only. Beware, that one bites. I don't like this kind of entertainment. I want to dance. Shall we go? I really feel like dancing. I'm afraid I'm not up to it. I don't want to be uptight. I want to be a lustful virgin. To me, making love is like breathing. When I met Saynanda, he looked at me.. He put his marvellous hand on my breast and said: "What is here, is out there. What is not here, is nowhere else." What is here is nowhere else. No. Beware, you'll wear her out. It was a good man, coming from the sea He spoke another language but he knew how to love.. To Karl Marx. Argh, poor Vladimir. If the typewriters were machine guns I'd find myself naked in shit like any other martyr. How far are you willing to go to follow me? Good night, my love Good night, between the phone and the sky... Saynanda and I slept together for a month without touching each other. One month, he'd sleep on my right. The next, on my left side. It was a ritual of preparation for the sacred coitus. And when it happened... It was unbearable. I even passed out and then, I got pregnant. I wanted to call my baby Maituna. We're closing up in an hour. Can I drive you home? Where? - Where you live? - I have no home. Where then? Wherever you want. That would be all for tonight. Thanks. Bye. This is unfair. He stops playing whenever he wants. And your luggage? Listen... They're offering me to perform Plato's Banquet. I'm a bit scared, at my age, to switch from variety to philosophy. The opposite is more difficult. They offered me also the role of Agathon but my dream role is Diotima. I can't listen to you anymore. I have to go with the miss. Please, do me a favour. Tell Nicola that I will pick him up tomorrow at 11. Gudrun! I'll pick him up at 11! I want him with the suitcase ready his pyjama and slippers. His balls and legs clean! Clear? Let's go. Excuse me. It's a story... Long and painful. I know that for you the Tantrism is just a matter of sex. No, I know very well that thanks to tantr... the Tantrism, there! We can even reach and understand the absolute. Do you know what does the orgasm mean to us? No, for you, I have no clue.. It's like a state of shock which set all your hidden energies free. The more you're free, the more you're wild. Where are you taking me? Nice tattoo. You like it? I've always liked storks. But since I aborted, they must be very angry at me. It's like I cheated on them. The storks can also accidentally let a child fall from their beak. You're saying that because you're kind. No, I'm pretty sure. Listen, your.. The guru's apprentice.. Your initiator, what has become of him? Gone. I was nothing but humiliation to him. Look, the sun is rising. I'm experiencing ecstasy. You are the one moving me! You, you're the Sun. You are God. You are God. How incredibly beautiful! A moment like this should last an eternity! Oh, God. I hope not. I'm hungry. I hope if we can buy cappuccino and brioches here. I'm hungry. - I'm starving. - Watch out. You haven't walked on high heels for a while. The red car is for crooks. It's not red. It's fuchsia. So classy. Good morning. We're so hungry. With lot of foam. Sir, please, take this lady away. Don't be cruel. I can't stand the sight of her. She blinds my sight. She's so beautiful. Almost in a insulting way. I see you can recognize the Divine. It has something do to with the spiritual perfection. - Perhaps. I don't know. - Thank you. See you soon. You always eat that much? I used to eat nothing at all. First you made me cry now eat two things I haven't be able to do for a long time. It's obvious you have some strange powers. Is there a phone nearby? I had it removed. Too much disturbance. I have to phone my doctor. My stomach aches. I sweat a bit. I suffer from a minor heart disease. The medical term is "tachycardia paroxystic". Call a doctor now? You... What's your name? Francesca. Pretty name. May I take the tray? Miss, for hygienic reasons, please do not touch all the croissants. Take and eat them all. In winter, we don't serve the cappuccinos at the table. - Beware, that girl is the devil. - She's beautiful! I'm glad she's eating all the croissants. What are we going to offer to our other customers. Anyway, you lose your mind whenever you see a pretty woman. Here are the house keys. Do not expect to enter a castle! Who are you talking to? I'm here. Sorry if I raised my voice. I still believe that people are not used to the roar of the sea. Where are you? Don't leave me alone here. Come. Your four children? Bravo. No. Not four. Two. Two, you see? Two are of my son and the other two of my daughter. I can't see anything without the glasses. But you saw me well? If you didn't, it's better we don't start anything. Bear in mind that I'm not a prince charming. I can even kill myself. Take me. Take me. Take me. You know what does "take me" mean? I have a slight blackout. I feel dizzy. I can faint any moment. Sometimes yes. Sometimes no. What do you say if I lie down a bit? So many feelings in just one night. First dawn, the sun, you... Now the God, storks, dawn... That jerk Nicola who needs an operation... It's just... I wasn't ready yet. On the other hand, you see the God you feel struck down. Such a shame. Come. Let's make love. I want to be up to it. Mom... Dad gave you a beating the day of my 1st communion. He was against it. He was an anarchist. I got all the brioches, even those most squashed. If it was summer, they would be full of ants. Thanks for last night. How nice your kimono is. Saynanda gave it to me, when he offered me to his friends. It's for whores. Coffee. I forgot... She told me to thank you. I'm so hungry. Who touched this purse? Sorry, I forgot to tell you I'm a little bit disorientated. How about moving into my studio flat? I'll manage somehow. Would you like to go now? Get up a bit. Get up. Now when I see you well you look like a monster. Show me your profile. You even have a beer belly. And I who have been with handsome men only. Excuse me for a moment. I have to go out. Excuse me... I'm going out a bit. Go away! Away! Let me die in peace. What are you doing? You are slashing your wrists? Egoistical swine! We were so happy together. In bed, you're a volcano. Don't make fun of me. I never joke about these things. Believe me, it was amazing. That's why I want to die. Our story is so beautiful that can't last long. A moment like that will never ever happen again. You can see God only once in a lifetime. Why are you drinking my blood? Why? Now, I'll close my eyes and you'll be gone. Kiss me one more time. I want to die with God's grace. I want to die like the ancient Romans. Inside you... But I want you to live inside me, here and forever. I'm flying... I'm flying... I'm flying to the hereafter. I'm the man here. You can't drag me along like that in front of people. Now I'm gonna eat two big, rare beefsteaks. That will pep me up. I'll go find the car. - You will be quick? - Yes. - I'll wait here. You cannot give her croissants every morning. She's my girlfriend. Yeah, girlfriend. - Thanks, Giuseppe. - You're welcome. Can I come now? You'll drive? Did you taste my blood? Yes. It has such a sweet savour. So, I do have diabetes. No, it has a wonderful vivid red colour. You're a vampiress! This is all mine! I'm buying all this! Aphrodisiac Cuisine "Tagliatelles with truffles" "Boil the tagliatelles in a..." Pasta? Aphrodisiac food? They get stuck in my transit. I'm surprised to hear that you need aphrodisiac food? Saynanda could stay 30 days without eating and he was a God. Francesca, excuse me, I need few infos from the sir here. May I? Excuse me. Where is the roast beef located? - On this side. - Here? And below is the fibre, which is divided into...? Head, tail and... and nipple. And rump, thighs? It's all below. OK. I love you, thanks, I love you. This is the chuck, right? I'm Francesca. But, Francesca, in India the cow is the mother of everything. Which canteen are you working for? None. There's a special cashbox for groups. No, we aren't a group. We're taking refuge. To eat... and screw. Lucky you. We look like 2 Vietnamese soldiers on the Ho Chi Minh trail. Where? - The Ho Chi Mihn Trail. - But who was Ho Chi Minh? Sorry. You can read Aphrodisiac Cuisine later. Give me a hand 'cause I... Look at all this stuff we've bought. Are you sure you want to stay here that long? I've already spent a fortune on this. Very chic. Sorry. Technical test. It works. So we can watch movies. It works. Damn it. The world has stopped communicating with us. That means that communication will be between you and me. Will we make it? You must have faith. Believe. You walk around with all that money? It's all I have left. You're not afraid of losing them or being mugged? No, to me, money means freedom. That's why I always carry them with me. I also have three rings of a huge value. How do I look? You're so cute. I want to look at myself in mirror, then make love with you. With pleasure. More. You're a vampire. What's going on? Damn it! Those damn artillerymen are practicing shooting. I have to raise the white flag. Aim better! Little Red Riding Hood, take off your rainproof. The shootings have aroused me. Who wants the first prize? I don't want to part from you. I want to stay with you. Otherwise I'll die. I don't exist. I feel like a man split in two. You are the other half. We're one sole being. A single being. And? I don't know. I think the shootings have upset me a little bit. I feel somewhat... weakened. Well, don't do it again. Wait. It's like a feeling... of loneliness. You laugh but it's like... It's like switching off the current. At moments... One moment, the current flows. The next, it's gone. Makes you laugh but... How about trying once more? And now, what am I supposed to do? You got me excited then you go away. Well, it's alright this once. I have a present for you. Turn round. Now I'll mark two spots. so I don't forget. Here... and here. What are you doing? Now, lie down. I have to cover you well. There. - And now? It's gonna be marvellous. There. Relax. That's right. My God! It works! God, I can't move. I'm blocked. I'm good at this! I made it! What did you do? My legs are blocked. My neck blocked. What' should I do? It's growing... huge. Your body is a condenser of energy now. It's huge now. It's almost frightening. Well done. Eating and making love. Possessing you and getting fed myself. All these things together. It's wonderful. Pasta with bacon? With bacon? Did you know that... I came 10 times. 10! I counted them. If you have counted them, then, we didn't make love. You only fucked me. - With this phoney thing. - Maybe so, but.. It was fantastic. It was a mechanical erection. Mechanical? You didn't like it? The soul can also make a cock hard. If there's no soul... But there is still the cock. A poem! Francesca... - Where are you going? - Out. Wait... I'm going too. You can't move. All your strength is gathered down there. Champagne? No. It's ice cold. - I guess I'll drink it alone, then, - Don't be a bitch. You'll be back? Who knows? Get back, OK? I'm the most potent man on earth! What's your name? Francesca, and you? Dialta. It's a strange but lovely name. It was a common name in the 13th century. Later, like everything else, it became old-fashioned. Where does "Francesca" come from? Franca, Francesca... Maybe from France. You know, Franco... And what are the boys' or the girls' names? She's Diana and she's Azzurra. This is such a nice place. Yes, I come here every day. It's good for the little girls. I love Saint Faustino. We've always had twins in my family thanks to S. Faustino. We love S. Faustino so much. Want to hold one? I aborted 3 months ago. I don't think I can feed them. Take her, come on. Here... Just like this. Like this. It's wonderful! You like it? Sure she does. See? - Do you want some champagne? - You have some? Where? It's good for breast-feeding. Giulia, don't forget to ask him money. You've already told me that Francesca! Where are you? I'm scared. Dad is drunk. Dad, are you there? No, I'm not here. We're your children I have no children! I only have a dog. Giovanni is with you? Mom didn't let us bring him along. That hyena... He's there. Hi, dad. Were you sleeping? Dad, you have a bad breath. - You don't sleep upstairs? - I do, but I put the bed here so I can look at the sea. Don't you feel cold sleeping naked like that? I have a sort of lumbago that blocks all my back. But all in all, I'm OK. I feel fine. So, this is the photo of you taken at your 1st communion? Yes, I wanted to show it to you. You should have done that on Wednesday. About two months ago. Didn't you see what happened that famous Wednesday? In any case, my problem is still unsolved. Because you left. Giulio, go get me a cup of hot chocolate. My name is not Giulio. Yes, dad. - What's his name? - Lucio. What are you staring at? Nothing. I'm not staring. You're laughing? Why are you laughing? - She's so lovely, Who's she? - My new girlfriend. She's not here at the moment but as if she was. I'm really happy for you, Paolo. Me too. Mom is going mad because of you. It's been 2 months since the last allowance you gave us. And no news from you. Where should I lay it down? There's a green funnel on the chair. Yes. Giulia, take the funnel. It's the best way to do it. Move it close to my mouth. Come near with the chocolate. Come on, climb up. Help him. With care, OK? Slowly, with care. A little bit more, more. He's suckling. I'm feeding him. Kids, get out. Visit time is over. Mom has started throwing stones again. Luckily I moved the bed over here. Mom knows how to aim. I know. This time, we screwed her. She was shooting upstairs thinking the bed was there. - What he said about the money? - Negative. Francesca! Help me. Were those your kids, outside? Finally, you're back. They take after their mother, they're both blond. Why didn't you come in if you saw them? What could I have done here? It would have been much better. If you had come in. I felt embarrassed. I think Giulia noticed my erection. Fortunately they come. at least they gave me to eat. I'm begging you. Please, release me from this spell. I will try to. Meanwhile, I'll take advantage of the situation. Easy... Gently. - I wanted to punish you, - Why? Why... argh? Because we didn't make love? No, because we did it that way. And you didn't like it? I liked it all the same, but... I wanted to go away... but I forgot to take the luggage. The luggage... You came back only because of the luggage? No, but I don't feel like it anymore. I'm melting down. I'm melting down. Want some? I beseech you to release me from what has become a curse. I forgot. Yesterday, while taking a walk, I saw a few storks. There are no storks here. What do you mean? What's this? Please, please. Last night, you promised something to me. Release me, you promised me. I did try yesterday but I was afraid I could fail. I told myself, this morning I'll eat, go out... Honestly, I've done it only once with a Japanese codger. What does that mean? I've always been with sexually gifted men. Considering we are not understanding one another I've got to change my attitude. I forbid you, ma'am, to leave me in a situation like this. You ought to do something to set me free! I take on myself full responsibility! Are you sure? If I fail, you are to blame. Don't you worry. Don't you worry. You make the sign of the cross? Wasn't this an Indian ritual? You never know. - No, Enough now! - What's wrong with you? The spots have disappeared. What am I going to do now? God, it works. God, it works... My God. Now, you have to explain me what does "sexually gifted" mean? A bunch of roses will please her But also the noise of cellophane But a beer is better than all On a sticky day like this I'm sitting on the top of a curbstone Thinking about my loves Between two bikes - the silence I simply can't describe Such a path in my sandals What trips Bartali must have done With that nose sad like an uphill Those joyous eyes of an Italian on trip And the French who go nuts Thanks, you made me a nice habit. My mom made me one when I was down with meningitis. You recovered completely? Yes. Thanks to cod's oil and Saint Anthony. I went to school barefoot for 6 months. All my schoolmates were nagging me: "Mellerio, twit, twit!" You keep on talking about your mother. I'm Francesca. It's such a nice place. There are... Some strange spirits, sensations.. I know. I used to take my dog for a walk there. We will reload ourselves spiritually. But I am spiritual, right? You're not spiritual. You only think about fucking. Now that... - Careful! Against the pirates. I can smell flesh here. But not dead flesh. Living flesh. Sex, pussy... How wonderful! I'll take off my rainproof and put my scene costume on. Here we go. I'm Agathon from Athens. Socrates' friend. Well, so-so. Nicola is dead. What? He drank the hemlock. Give me a break. May I? Thanks, very kind of you. Who's that man? A beggar. A true tramp. Where do you find the strength to be so theatrical? Where? How are you doing, guys? Hi. Hemlock... Are you ready for a love story? I'm a difficult, very difficult guy. Nicola... Nicola... I'm not speaking with you. If you want to know something, ask them. You won't hear anything from me. Come here, my little Nicola. You fools. Nice ass. Come, my friend. Leave her alone. - I wasn't talking to you. - How are you? I'm not moving from here. How beautiful you are, Francesca. So, how did the surgery go? I was supposed to go with my best friend. My... brother. My son. And he didn't show up. So did you have that operation, yes or no? Tell me the truth. You'll never find it out: maybe I did, maybe I didn't. Gudrun. He ordered me to say nothing. You are a bunch of... Aldo, did he have that operation? You want the lobster and I want to make love. My friends aren't that bad, right? I can't stand the sight of them! You're right. Let's stay home. Have a light lunch and tonight, I'll make you a dinner, a lavish one, with candlelight. Where's Giovanna? Calm down. She'll be right back. It's ready. This is the basic salsa for the roast beef in the microwave. The French call it "fumet". A roast beef without salsa is... naked. It's obscene. You talk about roast beef as if it was a woman. Who's there? We haven't invited any guests. I'm freezing. May I come in? Giovanna, come in. What are you doing here? Nicola is looking for you. You got lost in the forest? You look nice with these flowers. Want a foie gras canap? No, thanks. - Shall we call for a taxi? - No, thanks. I want to stay with you. Do you want me? These are for you two. But you hurt your hands... Poor thing. Want a glass of hot wine? So I can stay with you? Gladly, but it's a dinner in evening dress. How kind you are. Can you lend me your sari, the blue one? - You looked so nice in it. - Yes, come. You looked like the Virgin Mary. Can I join? You are jealous? She loves us both, don't you, Giovanna? Can I stay? Still asking questions? Look how beautiful she is. It's another kind of beauty, so different from yours. Cheers. Don't cry. You have all my platonic love. How wonderful. Two women at my feet. I would like to die here. You are a little bit in love with me? The other day, I nursed a baby boy. Or a baby girl. Do you want me to breast-feed you? Careful. Don't suck my soul out. Uniform of the Italian Navy. 1940. Seven Sinners. John Wayne! What are you doing? Hands off. Francesca, aren't you jealous? Jealousy is a feeling unknown to me. Then, I'm going to be busy. Go, go... Don't get angry but I'm crazy for him now. When I get bored, I'll let you know. Let's hope it happens soon. I'm madly in love with you. Now, go to sleep. We'll be back later. I'm sleepy. Cover yourself. The nights here are fresh and humid. And me? We're such jerks, We left her alone. Let's go back. No, no. Let's go to the house of crocodiles. Poor Francesca... One-eyed. You promised me... If you leave him... It wouldn't be easy because I love him so much. Good morning. Good morning. Did you sleep well? Let me see your nails. Now, have a bath, then a good breakfast and then off to school. At 1pm, we'll pick you up with a yellow minibus. Such a shame you have to go. We could've spent some time strolling along. One word more.. and I'll stay. And get covered with kisses. And me? Stop! This is our border. We can't go beyond. That's enough now. Isn't Giovanna nice? She's gone. So? I see now that you haven't got a grain of poetry. I wonder if the pirate flag is authorized? Is this the Regional Coastline, civic number 66? Yes, sir. May we come in? Of course you can. This house is open. Open to everyone. Even to officers of the law. Very clever. Are you Mellerio Paolo? Yes, I am. Why? You are Mellerio Paolo, aren't you? And You ask us "why"? You came here to get witty with me? We are here on investigation at the request of your employer. You've been absent from work for 3 months and 5 days without providing us with any written evidence. I don't need to justify myself. I'm sick. A nervous depression. Is that enough? I need a rest period. Do you know what is it? Follow the procedure: Medical certificate. What procedure? Chicken, wine, bread. You are having a picnic? - Yes. - And the music as well. Are you of legal age, miss? She is of legal age. She's my mistress. There's one more thing. Drop it. Let him speak. You wife called this morning. What does my wife want? She left you a message. A message? Yes, a message. Here, her exact words: Giovanni is dead. He'd been looking for you for months. He called you. Cried. He didn't eat at all. He died on your sofa. The one with flowers." What do you mean? It's not in the text. Why did you let him die? What had he done to you? I would send you to prison right away. What the fuck are you talking about? I had no space to keep him. I've always paid for food. But that hyena was giving him the school canteen leftovers. And she kept the money to herself. In summer, she would give him the hospital leftovers. I'm going to report her! I'll kill her! Your private life is no concern of ours. I'll bring you bread and milk, at least you'll eat that. No, I don't want to eat! He died because of me. It wasn't your fault. He was old. He would have turned Exactly. 7 by 15 makes 105. He would have been like a He would have been 105 but he died all alone. Stop it. It's worse for you living all alone without him. Let's make love like Giovanni used to do. What was it like? Poor dog. I'm coming in! Poor dog. A disaster. 3 litres on the floor. This is an ecological disaster. Yuk! Bye, I'm going out. Where are you going? You can't leave me alone here. So, it was you who unplugged the freezer. Anyway, I'll be able to recover it all. And you aren't moving from here! You should end up like Count Ugolino. If they cut you into pieces The wind would pick them up The spiders would sew on your skin back on. Take. She needs affection just like me. Where are you going? I'm coming with you. No, I want to go alone. Sorry, but tell me at least where you are going. I mean, you will go back? Why shouldn't I? Faustino? I saw a stork. I'm leaving tomorrow. I'll come to say goodbye. And God's pollen The smile from God I found you along the river while you were playing a gum leaf You were singing gentle words Words of love I tasted your lips of a red, red honey I said: "Give me what you want And I'll give you what I can." I've decided to leave. I saw a stork on the beach. I'm going with her. You're going with a stork? Alright. Where to? I don't know. Wherever the stork goes. You come across as good, but you're an hyena. Anyway, wherever I go, it's there I must go. Wherever you may go I'll follow you You can't. Why should you come? You are a liar. You lied to me. Little liar. You told me you had never seen a stork. It's not true. I swear I've never seen a stork. You don't love them. So, you don't love me either. Sorry but are you a stork? Mom. We've been in this house for months loving each other. We eat, make love. All of a sudden, she tells me: "I'll take a walk along the beach" She goes back and tells me she met a stork. A stork! She has to go with a stork. How can I understand such a bizarre behaviour? It's all quite simple. Quite simple. I'm not a stork, mom. I can't leave the ground. I will never become a stork. I can't fly up. Yet, I try. I do try. Corpus Domini... What about me? Don Guiseppe, what about me? Because of Paolo's communion my husband beat me black and blue and you are refusing him the host. Don't get angry, ma'am. A mysterious force moved my hand away. We did it. Under daddy's nose. We finally did it. Under daddy's nose. I'm here. We have to say bye. You can't go away just like that. True. I won't leave just like that, I like making love with you. So, you aren't leaving? I'm leaving... I'm leaving but before that let's make love. How clumsy you are. You're leaving but we'll always stay together. Our story will never end. But I want to make love. I can't live without you. I want to make love. Let me speak. Let me... What are you doing? You want to eat me? Sorry. Paolo is a bit extreme. I see now why my hand slipped. Francesca... The flat studio offer is still valid. I give you the keys. It's in Tigli Street 19. - Easy to remember. - You're generous. I'm staying here. I'll take up painting. My portraits? Rather still life or seascapes. Let's say goodbye here. I don't feel like getting emotional. Are you sure you want to leave? Yes. You're throwing it in the air, like that? We've already said goodbye. Francesca, come! Look! Look at the stork. She came to live with us. Did you see, liar? It's the one from yesterday. She came to take me away. You can stay too. Don't you see you're a liar? I'm not a liar. I cut off your arm. I used a very, very noiseless saw. You felt no pain. So I didn't disturb your rest. I'm coming, I'm coming. you're such a bore, mom. Be reasonable. I wanted to eat her, but couldn't do it without killing her first. We have our limits. We are still unable to make some miracles. Not a piece of God. I wanted to eat God whole. I don't think I'll make it. I'll get arrested before that. Believe and you'll be eating. Stork, I screwed you big time. Actually, I have to thank you. Without you God would already be gone. Why did you come? You had never come before, today you're here? You made such a mess. Francesca was happy. She didn't need you. It's all your fault, bitches!
