Alice, you put that down. Oh, Charlotte, everything's so beautiful. This is your daughter's wedding day. l want you to enjoy yourself. -l will. -How's it going in there? She getting dressed. Then you need to go on in and check on her. l want to make sure everything is all right. Everything is all right. -You need to go on. Come on. -Okay. Everything's gonna be fine. You just relax. Oh, yeah. l'm real relaxed today. -There's my son and his dreadful wife. -You be nice. William. Hello, mother. Miss Alice. Hey, William. Jillian, you are wearing that hat. Mrs. Cartwright. Alice, that is a lovely dress. Turn around. Now, don't you stop her. She's on her way in to see her daughter. l am. -You look pretty. -Thank you. Well, this is all very oddly nice of you, Mother. Yes, well, if my son hadn't eloped... then maybe l would have been able... ...to give him the proper wedding that mothers dream of. The yard sure looks lovely. Come talk to an old woman, William. Excuse me, sweetie. -Now, how's Judge Sales getting on? -He's good. He says to say hello. Excuse me, waiter, could l please get a drink? Do l look okay? Andrea, you look beautiful. Would you stop it? l don't like this dress. This is the dress Mama married Daddy in. So? Doesn't mean l gotta like it. She should have gotten that old woman to buy me one. She paid for the wedding, Andrea. What more do you want? She paid for a beautiful wedding for her black friend's daughter... ...so she could tell her friends she helped... ...the poor colored woman and her childrens. Stop it. Now, don't you embarrass Mama today. Well, if she wants to be Mammy and play Stepin Fetchit... ...it's not my problem. You are a piece of work. -Hi, girls. -Mama. -You're excited? -Yes. Andrea was saying how nice this is of Mrs. Cartwright... ...and how much she loves this dress. Oh, good, good. Look at you, you look beautiful. My baby. Thank you, Jesus. Okay, pretty girls, let's go get married. l'm gonna check on the cake topper. Make sure little Mavis got her rose petals, sweetie. Yes, ma'am. You're marrying your king today, okay? Remember that. -Don't embarrass Mama. -My king. -Come on, you gotta get straight here. -Man, l'm nervous. You sure you wanna do this? Come on, l love that girl. Then, that's all that matters, right? -Right. -Right. That's straight. -Brother, be honest with me. -What is it? l know Andrea's your wife's sister and all, but.... Am l doing the right thing? -What? -l said the same thing, man. You just got cold feet. You're just getting nervous, okay? -lt's all good. -Okay. All right. l got a question for you. Do you think you're doing the right thing? -l should marry her. -Hey. Good. Then let me get you married. Let me go see what's going on, okay? -Buy you a drink, so you can relax. -Yes. A drink, a drink. Yes. Thought you had enough at the bachelor party last night. Yeah, it's still sitting with me. -Baby, you gotta see this place. -Yeah. -Hey, what's the matter? -Andrea. She's driving me crazy. She is just the most ungrateful person l know. lf she disrespects my Mama one more time-- -Calm down. -...there wont be a wedding. -l want you to relax. -Okay. l'll run interference with you. -l ain't taking this home with us. -Okay, you better. -l will-- -You don't want me to-- -You'll tear these white folks' house up. -l sure will. -You gotta see this house. -All right. -Kitchen, bathroom. -l need a drink. -No, you can't. -Take me to the bar. Wow, Andrea, you sure have grown up. Thank you. William, right? My mother was telling me that you got a degree in Finance. Well, l will in about five months. -Congratulations. That's fantastic. -Thank you. l want you to meet my husband. Chris! All right. Thank you for coming. Pleasure. -Hey. -Hey, this is William. -This is Chris, my husband. -Congratulations. Mr. Cartwright, thank you so much. Thank you. You know, l work in construction too. l've been trying to get on that building you have downtown. What kind of experience do you have? When l was in the military, l worked a lot of construction. That's impressive. Well, who have you been talking to at the company? Some goofball. Yeah, he's been getting the runaround. Well, l'll tell you what... ...why don't you just call me directly, and l'll take care of it for you? -Are you serious? -Absolutely. We're all family now. -Okay. All right, l'm calling. -Okay. So, what are your plans after graduation? Looking for a job, l guess. l'll tell you what, when you're ready to join the work force, you give me a call. l'm sure we can find a position for you. -l'll do that. -Okay. -Okay. -Congratulations again. -Thank you so much. -Enjoy your evening. -Oh, my God. -Did you see that? -l can't believe it. -lt's our lucky day. -Hey. -Hey. There's big mama's little lawyer. How you doing? -Fine. -Yeah, that's cool. Get you a biscuit. Go on. Now, put that down. This is sweet tea, Junior. -l won't have you going to the doctor. -Thank you, Alice. Come on in, Mr. Blanchett. -Hey, Alice. -How are you doing, Nick? -l'm okay. -Yeah? You go on in the back and get yourself cleaned up. Pam? Pam. -Come and get Nick fixed up. -But this-- Come and get him fixed up. Come on, Nick. Thank you. You mother's a saint. Yeah, she is. We got some clean clothes for you, Nick. So do you mind if l throw those in the trash? -Okay. -And do you need a razor? You know? No, l'm okay. lt's up to you. So everything's in the bathroom, you know. Go back there, wash up really good, and your food will be waiting for you. -Okay, thank you. -Okay. -Thirty-eight times, man, 38 times. -Yeah. -We still playing poker tonight? -Yeah, l don't know about that. Pam wants me to spend some time with her tonight. Yeah, l hear you, it's all good. -Thanks for the lift, bro. -Hey, ain't no problem. l keep telling Andrea, man, l need to get a new truck. -She keeps freaking out on me. -You know she's gonna freak out. She making all the money. -Please. -What? That's gonna change, man. As soon as we get this thing together. Come on, Chris. Don't start. What? Come on, man. We can do this. We know way more than that idiot foreman of ours. But we don't know nobody that's gonna give us a shot, number one. Number two, nobody gonna give us no money to start up no company. You need to have a little bit more faith, brother. Listen, we get our business plan together. Old man Jackson already said his brother-in-law works down at the bank. All we gotta do is go down there and talk to him. -l don't know, l don't know. -Well, l do. lf you're so sure, man, what you need me for? The two of us are the dynamic duo. -Come on, man. Are you kidding me? -You wacko. Do l have to listen to this all the way home? -Yes, you do. -Then you taking the bus tomorrow. You're gonna do a purchase, and open, and it's gonna go up like this. That's where you're gonna end up. You got that? So this is a good one, huh? Well, you know, this is really, really good. Won't you stay for supper? -l need to go. -l'll fry some green tomatoes. l need to go. lt's too close. l need to go. lt's too much. Nick, if you ever feel like you wanna come off the streets... -...you let me know. All right? -l'm okay. Thank you, though. -Just don't forget to do this, all right? -Okay. -That's important. -l'll remember. -Don't forget. -l won't. -That's a big one. -Got it. You take care. Put that away for me. Mama, why do you entertain that man? He's obviously crazy. Be careful how you talk to strangers... ...because you could be entertaining an angel, unaware. That's the Bible, darling. Mama, you've been knowing this man for years. He ain't no angel. And if he was... ...you'd think God would send him with money so he can pay his bill. You know, it don't hurt to be good to people, Pam. -Everybody got a story. -Oh, yeah? Well, what's his? He used to come in here all the time. He loved my coffee. He'd leave me big tips. Then he got fired. His wife died. He lost custody of his kids. He just checked out on life. Now he's living wherever. -How are you? -Fine. -Hey, Priss. How was your day? -Hey, Mama. -Hi, Christopher. -Hi, Mom. You making a drawing? Give me a kiss. -We gotta go. -Damn. -Where are you going? -Home. You forgot you're supposed to pay me today? l swear, you act like $300 would break you. Here. Will that cover it? You know what? Keep your damn money. Hey, stop it now. -She makes me sick. -Stop it now. All l'm saying is, you only keep this child for two hours after school. He's your nephew. You ought to do it for free. That's right, he's my nephew. Not my child. -Sit down. -That's your responsibility. -Mama. -Come here. What is wrong with you all? l'm the one who's sick of it. You all been at each other's throats all your life. What is it? l am just so tired of her looking down her nose at us. Like we didn't live in the same house, or in the same neighborhood. l didn't like it then, and l don't like it now. ''l don't like it now.'' You hear that? She's so snooty. Turn around. This is your sister. When are ya'll gonna start acting like it? l watched you break your back in this place... ...to put this girl through college, and look at how she repays you. My back is not broken. -She's an ingrate. -Oh, that's a big word, Pam. -Shut up. -That's enough. You know what, sweetie, you can keep your little $300, okay. l don't need it. -But you mother does. -l do? Mama, yes. We only made $2 1 7 this week. You do the math, Miss Finance Major. Go on, put your fancy degree to work. Some weeks are better than others. That's why you plan for the long haul. But l am fine. No, you're not, Mama. -Keep your little money, girl. -No. Here. There's a check for $5000. Does that make you feel better, Pam? Oh, that's a start, Andrea. -l don't need it. -Yes, you do. Can l go now? Yeah, you can go. Thank you. -See you later. -Come on, baby. Can you jump down? Mama, you do need it. You know, l'm the mama. -Long day? -Yeah, yeah. -Thank you, sweetie. -You are so welcome. -You look good right now. -Thank you. Well, it looks like our son... ...is going to be attending the Whitmore Academy. Really. You'd think it was for a college rather than a preschool. l'm sure your mother called them. Well, maybe you should call and thank my mother. Yes. l'll call and thank her. So she can tell me what an awful mother and daughter-in-law l am... ...and how l couldn't make that happen for myself. Sweetheart, you know how my mother is. What do you think about that? Honey, it's beautiful. Pull your hair back, will you? l wanted you to have something to wear... ...to the opening of the new Cartwright Towers. -You got the contract. -Yeah. That's great. l just signed a half-a-billion dollar international deal. And l did it all alone. My mother's gonna have to turn the company over to me. -She will, honey. She will. -Yes. l'll tell you what, why don't l get cleaned up, take a shower? l'll meet you up upstairs in a little bit. Okay. Oh, yeah. -Go hug Daddy. -Daddy. Hey, you're running a little late tonight. -Hey, big man. -Yeah. How you feeling, huh? What's going on with you? Why don't you go wash your hands for dinner, okay? -You all right? -l'm good, l'm good, l'm good. -Baby, whose car is that? -Company car. Company car. Wow, that's nice. -Treating you real good over there. -Yeah. They're paying for this house, they gave you a Mercedes. Yeah. l wish they'd treat the construction workers like that. Baby, l need to talk to this Mr. Cartwright. -Why? -l just got some ideas, that's all. He doesn't see construction workers. -But l'll tell him for you. -Okay. What is it? l was just wondering-- l mean, you work pretty close with him, right? Not that close. Why? Well, l was just wondering if l can get a meeting with him, that's all. -What are you talking about? -Come on. You know l always wanted to start my own construction company. You know, l'm just thinking, maybe-- You know, he has all those contacts. He might be willing to give me one of the smaller jobs that he passed on. Maybe even front me with some of the start money. Don't be stupid. This man is not interested in helping you. He's a multi-millionaire, with a lot of better things to do. He's not trying to give out any handouts. l'm not asking for any handouts. -Chris. -What? Will you just ask the man for me? That's all l'm asking for, baby. -Okay, okay. -Thank you. Thank you. Let me get that for you. -Are you okay? -Yeah. Chris. l had a-- l had a long day. l just need a bath. -Lock up the back. -All right, now. Can you stand it? l bought it because it's as old as l am. Was made in the same year l was born. Not. -l got it today. -Why? Well, it goes with my outfit. No, now listen. l got this idea. l want us to drive across country. Like Oprah and Gayle. Oprah and Gayle don't have a diner to run. l got business to do, honey. Well, so do l. No, you got too much time on your hands entirely, obviously. -Alice-- -What's that smell? Burning? Alice Evans, you have spent your life inside the four walls of this diner... ...and every time l ask you to go on a trip, you give me some excuse. l'm having none of it. There's a whole world out there. And a bunch of fools running around in it. lt don't need me adding to the confusion. You never even seen the monuments, or the Grand Canyon, or the ocean. Come on. Life is short, girl. Yours is passing you by. -What's gotten into you? -Nothing. Come on, let me take you for a spin. -l got to go to choir practice. -Well, that's perfect. Come on. Hop in. l been up since 5:00 this morning. l ain't ''hopping'' nowhere. l've never seen you drive. Where is Morgan Freeman? -l drove here, didn't l? -Help me, Lord. You've got to take off the emergency brake. That's the smell. -You burning out the transmission. -Oh, no. There we go. Okay. Hallelujah. Hang on. -Hey, baby. -Hey, baby. Taste this. -That's good. -Good? That's better. -How was work? -Work was work. Chris. All day long... ...talking about us starting our own construction company. Well, have you given it any thought? Baby, you kidding me? Come on. l mean, it doesn't sound like a bad idea. Speaking of bad ideas, you know what he wants us to do? He wants us to go to Cartwright and ask him for the money for the start-up. -And? -What you mean, ''And''? ''Excuse, Mr. Cartwright, l know we work for you... ...but can you give us $300,000 so we can become your competition?'' ''l love black people. Here's the money.'' Come on, baby. That's so silly. Come on. lf you come up with a good business plan... ...maybe, you know, we could get our own loan. Now you sound like Chris. Every minute we get, he's talking about what's wrong... ...and what we can do better, and how we can do it better. Maybe he has a point. l get it. You've been talking to Chris about this. No. l know we ain't balling out of control like your sister, but we're all right. -l think we got a comfortable life. -lt has nothing to do with that. -l could care less about her. -Then, what is it? No, no, no, you started this. Tell me, what is it? Ben, you used to have big dreams. And somewhere along the line, baby, you stopped dreaming. Do you remember how much debt we were in when l got out of the military? -l know. -Remember how we were struggling? We're just getting on our feet. Can we be stable for a little while before we go dream-chasing? -Okay. -Thank you. Sorry. Oh, you mad now. l'm sorry, baby, l'm just tired. We shouldn't be arguing over money. Come on. Come on. -That's true. -lt's all good, baby. -So when's dinner ready? -The bathtub is ready. -Yeah. -Shot down. -Just until you clean it up a little bit. -You don't like the funk? Not unless it's P-Funk. -Well, other women like the funk. -You know what? l've never heard anything so beautiful in all my days. That girl been singing like that since she was 6. Alice, do you think God forgives us for all our previous sins? Sweetie, that's why Jesus died, to pay for our sins so we don't have to. Sometimes l feel as though l've been paying for things my entire life. lf you having a midlife crisis... ...l better get that choir back in here to sing some more. Just, thank you, for being my true friend. l've only been the kind of friend to you that you've been to me. Have l been good to you? Yes, you have. My girls and l are very grateful for you. You know that. -Are you okay? -Oh, l'm fine. l'm fine. Are you sure you're not gonna drive across the country with me? l am so sure. Well, l'm leaving a week from Sunday... ...whether you're in or whether you're out. You're gonna miss all my cracker barrels.... Well, l know your work at Sunshine was very impressive. They posted record quarters during your tenure. lt was a good time. And you're sure you ready to move on? Yes, ma'am, l am. -You've studied our operation? -l know that if you give me time... ...l'll be able to take your company global and build a bigger profit share. -Miss Dexter, welcome to Cartwright. -Thank you. This board is gonna be so glad to see some new blood. All except for one, that is. -And who might that be? -My son. William. Come on in here and meet Miss Abigayle Dexter. -Hello. -Hi. Hi. l know your work. So, what's going on, Mother? Well, we're just concluding a little business. What kind of business? Well, Abby was just telling me... ...she thinks she can take this company global. Well, Mother, we already have. l just signed the Hong Kong account. We're building their new towers in Los Angeles. -Wow, that's great. -Thanks. When l was shadowing that deal, l saw that you were having difficulty... ...negotiating the vertical and the signage. How did you manage? Well, Miss Dexter, l have my ways. lf you'd like me to take a look at the deal, l'd be happy to do so. l'm sorry, excuse me. Why are you here again? l just stole this young thing from Smith Sunshine. She's gonna be our new COO. Miss Dexter, would you be so kind as to wait for me in the sunroom? -We can finish up there. -Certainly. Excuse me. l thought you were considering me for that position, Mother. Well, why on earth would you think that? Why? Because l'm your son, that's why. Grow up then. -You are not qualified. -You know l'm qualified. l know this company like the back of my hand. You, you, you. You know nothing. But what l tried to teach you these last three years, you haven't learned it yet. l will expect you to bring Miss Dexter up to speed. ls that clear? Yes, Mother. lt's very clear. Agnes. Bring me a bourbon in the sunroom and see what Miss Dexter would like. Right away, Mrs. Cartwright. Okay. Okay, Mother. We've been in construction all of our lives. Most of our lives, anyway. You know, that's all we need is a little startup money. -l'm sorry. -Told you this was a waste of time. What do you mean, sorry? You haven't even looked at the proposal. We're not in the position at this time to take this kind of risk. -Not in the position? -What you're asking me is impossible. lt's not impossible. We gotta get back before lunch is over. lf he would just look at the proposal-- Let's go. Thank you. Hold on, let me get some money real quick. -Welcome to First One. -How you doing? l'm good, thank you. What can l do for you? -l just need to get out about $40. -Okay. -Thank you. -Yeah. From which account? Well, there's only one account. Sorry. lt says here Andrea and Christopher Bennett, same social. Yeah, l know. She's my wife. There's more than one account? -Yes, sir. -Okay, so, what's that balance on it? Two hundred eighty-six thousand dollars and forty-three cents. Come again? What do we got? Very impressive. There's only one problem. And l'm sure Andrea being in accounting, she can appreciate this. This deal is front-loaded. All the gain is upon completion. And your point is? My point is $25 million added to an already stressed fiscal budget. This is a solid deal. This company stands to have record highs in the first quarter of over 1 1 -- -l understand that. -Don't interrupt me when l speak. l made this deal on the strength of this company. And it's a good deal. Are you done? May l speak now? -Yeah, you can speak. -l understand that. But this company is in no financial position to shoulder such a risk. We're overextended with the four projects we're involved in now. And now you go and sign a deal that makes us liable for $25 million... ...that we don't have right now. -This company's cash poor. -This is a publicly traded company. Surely we can raise $25 million. We've done it before, we'll do it again. And how do you propose we do that? l'll tell you. My mother sells 1 0 percent of the business. She would lose her control of the vote. l can't advise her to do that. Advise her? You wouldn't advise her of anything. Who do you think you are? l'm the woman that your mother put in place to run this company... ...and that's what l intend to do. You don't come into my business... ...speaking to me as if l'm some subordinate. And what makes you think that you're qualified... ...to advise my mother of anything? Perhaps it's my Yale Law degree. Or my masters in Finance. Or my 1 5 years of experience that would qualify me, and not allow us... ...to enter into an agreement that is so top-heavy... ...it would bring this company to its knees. To its knees? l'm talking about making money. Do you understand what you have done? l might put your new office-- May l please speak? lf it's okay with Mr. Cartwright. Go ahead, Andrea. Mr. Cartwright owns 3 percent of this company. So if his mother were to sell... ...the family would still have the controlling vote. l will speak to Mrs. Cartwright. But not until l've exhausted all other possibilities. Good. You do that. l will also make it perfectly clear... ...the position that you've put this company in. Charles, Mark, Betty, come with me. Everybody else, you can leave. Thank you very much. That was eventful. -Are you okay? -l'm fine. -Hey, love. -Jillian. What a surprise. Hey, sweetheart. Just thought l'd stop by... ...maybe take my hard-working husband to lunch. Well, that's sweet. Just wanted to make sure you were okay. l'm fine, baby, l'm fine. -Hi, Mrs. Cartwright. -Hi, Robin. Master's on line three. He is? Okay, l gotta take that, sweetie. -Come see me in 1 0 minutes. -Okay. -Andrea, my goodness. -Hi. Four years. l haven't seen you since your wedding. How's your husband? Christopher, right? Yeah. He's good. Doesn't he work for the company? Yeah, on the construction side. l see. Andrea. That's a-- A lovely fragrance. Thank you. Sixteen on center. He said once the inspector gets here to take a look at it... ...he'll be able to let us go. You listening to me, Chris? Chris. -Hey. -Yeah? What's going on with you, man? The bank said no, okay? lt's done. Let it go. We got a job, it's all good. What is wrong with you? -Chris. -What? What? l'm good. -Hit the ground. -Come on, l just said-- Hit the ground. We're 55 stories in the air, l gotta depend on you. -You zoning out? What's going on? -Nothing, man. The bank. -The man said no. -That's not what l'm talking about. -What the hell you talking about? -Remember when l went to the bank? l go up to the teller to get some money and she brought up another account. With Andrea's name on it. And? All women keep money on the side. Pam got $300 in an account. She don't even think l know. l am not talking about a little money, man. l am talking about $286,000, brother. Come again? -Same thing l said. -You better call her, man. l'm not talking to her. l'm not even sure that l wanna know. She makes $65,000 a year. Where in the hell is she getting that money from? Matter of fact, don't tell Pam anything, all right? l'm a grown-ass man. l don't tell my wife everything. l knew there was a catch. The minute you told me you closed that deal, l just knew it. Now, how do l get out of it? l think that would be bad for business. This company's been known to sue in very public, nasty trials. Well, we're gonna have to find a way to raise some capital. Call Rolly over at Bank of Austria. With the housing market where it's at, we're gonna have to-- Just call him. l did. We're at our max. He won't loan us another dime. After all these years of doing business with him? lt was our wealth that established them as the force they are. And he said no? Well, you tell him if he doesn't, l will close my account and move to Bank Z. Brian has been begging for our business for years. We have a good relationship there. l don't think that that's the answer. Well, what do you think is the answer? This is an awful situation, but there is a solution, albeit imposing. -lf we sell 1 0 percent of the stock-- -l won't hear of it. That puts me in the minority. My vote won't matter. No, Mother. l still have a percentage in the company... ...which would give you controlling vote. Along with yours. Mrs. Cartwright, he is your son. Miss Dexter, my family has been known to prey on the weak. Mother, you don't trust me? lt's not you l don't trust, darling. lt's your private thoughts that give me pause. Will you at least consider it? Ten percent. Sell it. Now, William. l know you're up to something. No. Just money. Well, let me tell you... ...if you burn me, l will nail your ass to the wall. Yes, ma'am. Your mother's tough. All mothers aren't like her? You know, Miss Dexter, l think we got off on the wrong foot. Maybe l could take you to dinner sometime. Sure. Me and my husband would love to. -Working late again, huh? -Yeah. -Well, come here. -l'm tired, Chris. No, baby, come here. Sit down for a second. What? -What are you doing with this? -You know, l was wondering myself. Like, how are we affording all of this stuff? Where in the hell did all this money come from? -You sure you wanna know? -Please, this is not a game. Now, you tell me what the hell is going on. None of your damn business. You don't ask me questions about the money l'm making. l can be the nicest guy in the world, but if you keep pissing me off... ...then we are gonna have a problem up in here. l get bonuses at work. -l get bonuses at work. -Bonuses. Yes, and this is my money. This is my money, Chris, and l don't tell you everything... ...because you're always talking about some get-rich-quick scheme. You always find something to invest in, or buy, or screw up. l'm just trying to make a better life for our family, that's all. Family. By blowing all my money? Chris, you will never be William Cartwright. He's smart. He can carry on a conversation with the business world without stuttering. He's charming. He went to Harvard. Get over it. You will never be him, or in business for yourself. Now, put my mail back in the envelope... ...and put it back in the drawer where you found it. He looked at the paper, he looked up at us: ''We ain't gonna give you all that money.'' -So they said no. -Then go to another bank. lt's just one bank. Baby, why you pushing this so hard, huh? Tell me, l don't get it. You know, maybe it's a sign we ain't supposed to do this. Ben, you can do this, okay? You can, baby. You know what l think you're afraid of? You're afraid that this just might work. -l ain't scared of nothing. -Okay, well, then what is it? l like our life, it's simple. We're happy. Why can't we leave it at that? l want a new sofa. And l'm not asking for diamonds and pearls. l'm not asking to be filthy rich here, okay? l just think it's okay to want a little bit more. A little more is the problem that Charlotte has, your sister and William. They all want more. Those people are not happy. l don't want us to end up like that.

This is delicious. l don't know why you didn't get one of these. l ain't drinking nothing named after a natural disaster. When's the last time you even had a drink? Maybe l ain't never had a drink, Miss Nosy. l wanna know. l know you had a drink somewhere back 85 years ago. You the one drinking a Hurricane.

This gentleman was just leaving. Hey, Mr. Cartwright. Chris. -Andrea's husband. -lt's been a long time. How you doing? -Yeah. -Hi. l'm Abigayle Dexter. Abigayle. Nice to meet you.

Everything's going well down at the site. Good. Let me know if you need anything, okay? -Well, actually, Mr. Cartwright-- -Chris. Yeah? -What is it? -lt's probably nothing. Let him talk. What is it? Well, l just wanted to run a few ideas by you, that's all. Robin, give us 1 5 minutes in between our meeting. Come to my office. -Let's talk. -Yeah. Yeah, sure. Hello? Yes, your appointment is going to be 1 5 minutes late. l'm so glad you decided to come with me. l am too. l must admit though, at first l thought you had lost your mind, but this is fun. -So where are we going next? -l don't know. That's the beauty of it. We get up and drive... ...and just wake up and go wherever we want. Okay, but it would be kind of nice to know what direction we're going in. West. We're going west. We're gonna sleep in fleabag motels and eat at truck stops... ...and hang out with all the regular folk. You know, l been regular all my life. lt ain't nothing new to me. But l wanna see you stay one night in a motel. Lord have mercy. Alice, l can go with the flow. Yeah, l bet you can. My child ain't speaking to me because l didn't promote him. Why didn't you promote him? Well, let's not forget the hell he put me through. Four years at Harvard and three years in rehab. Yeah, but he got it together. l told you he would. Don't be so hard on him. He ain't got it yet. Sometimes you gotta let them go for them to get it. Sometimes you say the simplest things, and it means so much. lt's just the truth. l raised mine up, but they'll kill me. Amen. Amen. You know what? Don't say ''Amen'' while you're sucking on that. God! Dog. -l feel closer to heaven when l drink. -Shame on you. Sit down. So how can l help you? Well, Mr. Cartwright, l.... You know, l was thinking about... ...starting my own construction company. Much smaller than this, of course, you know. Of course, of course. Well, you gotta start somewhere. Well.... And l was wondering maybe you would like to... ...invest. lnvest? lnvest, yeah. Yeah. Okay. Well, do you have any other investors? Well, none. You are the first person l.... You know l work very closely with your wife. And l'll get back to you through her. How about that? Yeah, yeah. Okay. Okay. Thank you. Hey, Robin? Hey, Chris, hold on one second. Your wife is doing an amazing job. Thank you. Robin, let them know l'll be there in 1 0, okay? Thanks. You got enough cameras? Well, if the digital thingy fails, then these are the backups. Are we lost yet? No, we're not lost. We are approximately 346 miles from Las Vegas. -Let's get a drink. -Do you want the Coke? No, l mean a real one. Sheryl Ann, let's go. -Oh, no, l'm not going up in there. -Oh, come on. lt'll be fun. -No, it won't. -Yes, it will. Darling you, like l am, are bored with your life... ...and you need just a little bit of adventure, l think. l'm not bored. Charlotte, l'm not going in. Yes, you are. You're coming with me. -No. -You'll be safe. l'll be with you. Look who's out front though. l know, that looks like my Uncle Ted. l'd like two, please. Thank you. Here's your ticket, l got mine. This is so great. -l put my money in church. -They got live music. Excuse me. Oh, my God. Look, that woman's got a-- She's got a flag for a shirt. Come on, we'll just have one drink, Alice. That can't hurt. -What'll it be? -Water. -Two shots of tequila. -Two shots of water. William, the board will be happy to have you in charge. -Thank you. -Ma'am. Have a good evening. What was that about? The board and l have decided to vote my mother out. Hello, William.

Richard. -Richard, nice to meet you. -Pleasure. -Nice to meet you. -There's a lot of excitement here. Yeah. Enjoy your evening. Andrea. Hello, Mrs. Cartwright. That's a lovely necklace. Not as lovely as yours. Excuse me, the mayor's here. Excuse me. Well, hey, Mrs. Cartwright. l'm Andrea's husband. -Chris, right? -Yeah. Yeah, Chris. Chris. How are you? l'm good. l'm-- Yeah. l'm real good. Well, you look very handsome. -Thank you. -You're quite the couple. Enjoy. Wow, baby, this place is really nice. Please don't do anything to embarrass me. -What are you talking about? -Just don't talk to anybody. Oh, baby-- Here you go, ma'am. -Have they got a bull? -No. So, what are two nice, pretty, little fillies doing in a place like this? Who said we're nice? Hi, l'm Sam Walton. Like Wal-Mart? Well, not quite, ma'am. l'm Thelma and this is my friend Louise. Howdy. Howdy. Well, that wasn't quite fair, was it? l mean, l gave you my name but you didn't give me yours. l'm Alice and this is Charlotte. -Hi, Charlotte. -Hey. So you two running from the law? Not quite. Me and my good friend here... ...we're driving across this great country of ours. That's great. Enjoy life while you can. You can say that again. -So how'd you all meet up? -You sure ask a lot of questions. -We're friendly around these parts. -Well, if you must know... ...my husband was doing a developmental deal in an urban area... ...and she refused to sell. So he sent me in to sweet-talk her into it. l've never met anybody as strong-willed in all my life. We've been friends ever since. That was 30 years ago. -She's seen me through two divorces. -Three. -Three? -Three. Oh, right. l tried to forget that one. Well, Miss Three-Time-Divorced Little Lady... ...will you dance with me? -Why, l don't mind if l do, cowboy. -Thank you, ma'am. Don't let him be number four. Hey, you wanna dance? You know how to holy dance? The holy dance? No. No, l don't. l didn't think you did, either. Keep on stepping. Yeah, l know. Hey. Chris, right? Yeah. Yeah, you know what? Have you seen my wife? No, l haven't. Maybe she's with William. Who's William? l'm calling you a taxi. You've had too much to drink. -No. l'm good. -No, you're not good. l'm trying to help you here. Help you keep your job. Oh, okay. Fine, then. l mean, all l'm doing is just a little drinking. lt's not like l'm upstairs with William like Andrea is... ...with my husband looking for me. You know what l'm saying? Time to go. Your husband's been talking to banks about starting his own company. And people have told me that he's tried to contact... ...some of our competition for help. Well... ...he can be persistent. Yeah, well, l don't like it. lt's not good for business. So l'm gonna fire him. Good. More ammunition for me to leave him. -You are evil, you know that? -You love it. Excuse me, Mrs. Cartwright. Have you seen my wife? She's with my husband. -You enjoying yourself? -Yes. Yeah, l am. Baby, where in the hell have you been? He needed some files. Come on, let's go. You left the party early, Jillian. Do you love her? What did you say? Do you love... ...her? l love you. You won't even answer my question. l answered your question. Good morning. Where we at? You said just go west, and we going west. Oh, l tell you... ...these seats aren't as comfortable as they were when l was a girl. Because you was always on your back in them. Listen to you. -Charlotte. -Yeah. -This trip about both of us, ain't it? -Yeah. Well, it's my turn, darling. -There is no way. -Oh, way. -Alice. -Come on, trust me. You don't even know what denomination they are. lt don't matter what denomination you are if it's about God. -Don't pull in so close. No, Alice. -lt's okay. No. Alice. We're gonna get in such trouble. -What? -Come on, let's go. Come on. Alice. No, no, no. Wait, wait, wait. Be quiet. Be very quiet. Let's just stand in the back. Let's just stand in the back. Come on. No, no. Come on. No, Alice. lt's a sin to cut in front of all these people. They let the big sinners up. -Hallelujah. -Hallelujah. Pastor, me and my friend were just driving across country... ...and she ain't never been baptized. And we was just wondering-- l know why you're here. Come on, child. You kidding me? This is St. John. lt's named after Saint John the Baptist. Come on. -Wade in the water, Charlotte. -Wait, wait, wait. -lt's okay. Come on. Get in there. -l'm gonna break my neck. Go on. What about your heavy glasses? Too late. Get in. Don't let go. lt's freezing. -Hallelujah. -Hallelujah. Grab my arm. Grab my arm. Alice Evans, l need a drink. -No, you don't. -No, you go to hell. -We ain't going to hell. We're saved. -Oh, good. -l'm going, anyway. -l'm so proud of you. -Hi. -Hi. -Thanks for the other night. -Don't mention it. Good morning. Good morning. Andrea. Do you think l can see you for a moment, please? Sure. -l think you do a great job here. -Thank you. But as l've been evaluating your performance and going over records... ...l've come across some things that concern me. -Such as? -Just don't know about something. -What is that? -You know we have a strict... -...no-fraternization policy here, right? -l'm very aware of it. l've been here four years. Well, the things that concern me are... ...several thousand dollars of purchases that seem to be personal. Hotel stays every Wednesday. Things on Mr. Cartwright's credit card... ...that seem to coincide with your time spent away from the office. What are you getting at? -You having an affair with Cartwright? -No. l was so hoping that you were gonna be honest with me. -l can't protect you if you're gonna lie. -l don't need you to protect me. -And you think he will? -l know he will. Mr. Cartwright is the not the type of man... ...that will take orders from the likes of you. You just got here. You better watch your step. lt is sisters like you that give us all a bad name. Screwing your way to the top instead of doing it the right way. The right way. The right way is graduating top of my class... ...getting my masters and helping this company report record profits... ...in two and a half of the four years l've been here. Affair or not, l'm doing it the right way. So, Abigayle, who did you screw to get here? Unlike you, l have worked my ass off to prove that l'm just as good... ...if not better than my counterparts. What you are doing, Andrea... ...will get you there but it will not keep you. -We're gonna have to let you go. -We'll see about that. -He has no authority to keep you here. -And you have no authority... ...to make me leave. l love this song. You ever heard it? l never heard it before. Listen. Listen to the words. Promise me that you'll give faith A fighting chance And when you get the choice To sit it out or dance l hope you dance -That's beautiful. -That's the way it is. And we are gonna dance, my friend. We are gonna dance. Not butt-shaking dance. No, but you have a dancer's heart, my darling. -Did you see that? -Don't even think about it. Hey. -Come on, we gotta go. -Oh, where's my Bible? Charlotte. We've got to. l'm not kidding, Charlotte. You better slow down before you get a ticket. Oh, officer. Officer. -Look. Look. -Oh, Lord. Hey, baby. You wanna rub oil on my body? Yeah. Yeah, yeah. l'd like that. l'd like that. Father, Son and the Holy Ghost. Some oil for your little.... Come on, stick it out there. Stick it out there. l thought so. Yeah, baby. You'd better wash your hands when you get out of here. Wash your hands when we get out of here. Okay, l will. Hey, Charlotte. Charlotte. -What are you doing? -l can't load this camera. lt says-- Keeps just saying, ''Memory full''. -Honey, it's the-- -Don't touch me. Don't touch me. Look at me. What is it? Alice. Yeah. W--? What? lt's Saturday. Well, actually, it's 3:00 Sunday morning. But yesterday was Friday and we danced. Yeah, we did. We danced all night long. Sweetie, what is it? Are you okay? -Were you having a bad dream? -No. What is it? The memory is full on this camera. Let me see it. You know, we could get a-- We can get a new memory card. Oh, l wish it was that simple. Memory card is full. l have early onset Alzheimer's. The doctors say there's nothing they can do. Did you get a second opinion? Three. They all said the same thing. No. lt's gonna be all right, Charlotte. Not this time. Oh, we've been through a lot of things together, Alice. But not this time. lt's not gonna be all right this time. Don't let my son put me away. l won't. And you mustn't tell anyone. -You promise? -l promise, l won't. And when l start to forget... ...will you help me remember? Yes, l will. l will. Of course l will. l wanna go home. -Will you take me home? -Okay. You're okay. -Hey, Joey. -Won't be needing you guys anymore. -Ben, Chris, your last checks. -What the hell you talking about, man? -What's going on? -The tools belong to the company. Wait a minute, is Cartwright here? Does he know this? He's out today. He knows. Joe, man. Come on, what happened? -Well, did they say why? -No. lt's probably all this talk about us starting our own company. -No. -Who you talk to at that party? -l didn't talk to anybody at the party. -Do you know what kind of position... -...that puts us in? -Ben, don't. Just-- No, no, no. No, he needs to know this. Car payment, mortgage and no job? l was doing fine, we were on our feet and you.... -lt's okay. -Look, listen. Maybe this is just a sign that we need to go into our own business. And you're still talking about this. You listen to me. Get your head out of the clouds. lt ain't gonna happen. This ain't no damn sign. lt's over. Man, look, l already made some moves. How have you made moves, man? You ain't got money. So it's either you're in or you're out. What kind of moves you made? You ain't got no money. Chris, what the hell? -What is with--? Andrea. -Hey, baby. Hon, listen, let me explain, okay? -l took all the money out of the bank. -l know that. l opened a business account. We're gonna go into business for ourselves. -You did what? -Ben and l got fired today. l just think that's a sign that we should just go into business on our own. -That is my money. -Yeah, but we're in this together, right? No, no. l'm in this. You go get my money back. lt's a little bit too late. The majority of the deposits went out this morning. You bastard. You just take my money without asking me? No, baby, this is gonna work out for the best. Trust me on that, okay? You know what? l am getting so sick of you. l am so tired of supporting this whole family by myself. l thought a man was supposed to help a woman. -You are so weak. Both of you. -Today ain't the day and l ain't the one. You understand me? What are you gonna do with your broke ass? -l got your broke-ass, trick. -Go to hell. -This is my wife you're talking to. -Don't mean nothing to her. What is that supposed to mean? Yeah, what is that supposed to mean? -You'd better get her, babes. -Okay, l know. -That's what l thought. -Andrea, just drop it. -You stole my money. -Baby-- You and this loser will never be William Cartwright. For one, ain't nobody trying to be no William Cartwright, you understand? But you can't see that, because you're so busy on his lap every night, right? Oh, come on, man. What are you talking about? Chris, man, come on. Everybody know, man. They talking about you behind your back at the site. Everybody know. Baby, what is he talking about? Now, come over here a second. l need to talk a second. -What's he talking about? Start talking. -Fine. All that money you stole from me was given to me by William. Why would he give you so much money? Oh, this-- Because he's my man, Chris. -Chris. -Wait a minute. -Don't you-- -Stop it. Who'd he slap so hard like that? You've been making me feel like the whole time that this is my fault... ...that l'm the one that's crazy, and you been doing this the whole while. You know what? Keep that money. There's plenty more where that came from. ln fact, you know what? Here's some more. You go buy yourself some boxes and get your stuff out of my house. Five years we've been married and you talk to me like that. And we've got a son. What are you gonna tell him, huh? My son is a Cartwright. Jillian. You are here in my rose garden. And without calling. Here, sit down. lt must be something awful if you came to see me, of all people. William... ...is having an affair. lt's been going on years, with this woman. According to the private investigator... ...they meet every Wednesday... ...at the Mayhew Hotel... ...Room 629. Room 629, huh? That's the same room his father used to have affairs in. l know it well. He so wants to be like him. You know why l never much cared for you? Because you're such a weak little thing. To be a Cartwright woman, you have to endure a lot to enjoy these comforts. You didn't mind his father having affairs? No. While he was having his, l was having a few of my own. Cartwright men are the kind of men that wander. We have to be the kind of women that stay a few steps ahead. l jus.... l ca.... What? Oh, you love him. ls that it? Yes. And here l was thinking you married him to get out of that old trailer park. You-- You-- l don't know why l came to you for help. You don't need my help. You are a woman scorned without a prenupt. That is a recipe for good living. You go on home. Have yourself a stiff drink, pull yourself together... ...and make your demands. He'll listen. You hold all the cards. Since you know so much about the Cartwright men... ...l think you should know... ...your son is planning a board meeting today to have you voted out. l can't believe he hit me. l have never seen Chris so upset. l'm gonna press charges. No, wait. When did you and William... ...start sleeping together? Mama, this is not up for discussion. l'm divorcing Chris. And me and William are gonna be married. Oh, you are, huh? Just like that, huh? Just like that. This is not the '60s. That's how it's done now. Andrea. You are so disrespectful. Do you really think that man is gonna leave his wife and his child for you? Shut up. Shut up. Yes. He will. Why is that so hard for you to believe? He won't marry you. No he won't, baby. l'm sure someone told the very same thing... ...to the woman who took Daddy from you. You damn near pushed him in her arms. Hey. You have no idea what happened between me and your father. -You have no idea. -l know that he left us here. He left us and he never came back because of you. He left us here struggling and broke... ...while he went off and remarried and lived well. Yes, he did. He certainly did, but that was 30 years ago and l let it go. Andrea, you have to let it go now. You can not build your life on hurts from the past. William is from a different world than you, honey, and he will not marry you. He will. He loves me. Where did l go wrong with you? You can't make yourself happy bringing misery to other people. l can see where this is going. Don't do it. Andrea, don't do it. l raised y'all to love God and respect other people. What you're up to now is only gonna lead to disaster for you. Well... ...then l'm gonna enjoy the ride on the way. So here's what we're looking at. We've got 33 floors of office space... ...we've got 25 floors of condominiums. And roughly between 600,000 and a half a million dollars more... ...you can get the gorgeous view of Atlanta, okay? And you have great schools, the education is topnotch. We have two schools down the street, and they're just absolutely beautiful-- You're sleeping with my wife? You son of a bitch! -Get him off me. -You're sleeping with my wife? -Chill, man. -Get off of me. Hey, baby, you're running late. You won't believe the day l had. l went to my lawyer's and-- Mrs. Cartwright. Yes, Mrs. Cartwright. My husband won't be seeing you again. You're pathetic. That's why you're limited to this little room. He won't be seen in public with you. You think his colleagues would deal with him... ...if he showed up with you on his arm? You stay away from my family. -Oh, Mr. Cartwright, the-- -Not now, not now. What the hell? l'm the only one who has authority to call a meeting. You don't say? -Mother. -Have a seat. Not in your father's chair. Why don't you come down here and sit by me? With pleasure. Well, Mother, what's this about? You, darling. lt's all about you. So tell me, what have you been up to while l've been away? Well, Mother, l'm glad the board is here. l've already explained to them... ...that several decisions that you've made, including hiring Ms. Dexter... ...is not in the best interest of this company. Therefore, the board and l have voted to retire you. ls that so? -lt's a unanimous decision, Mother. -Unanimous? What about my vote? For some reason, you don't have control of the share anymore. And you voted against me. Yes. -Are you sure every member voted? -Most of them. All except the Calvary Company. But they've been silent for 1 5 years, they never vote. Well, maybe it's high time they did. -Are they here? -Yes, they are. -Abby, would you? -Yes, ma'am. And would the three of y'all unanimously... ...scoot to the other side of the table? Thank you. -Sit here. -What's going on here? Mother, this is precisely why... ...this company thinks that you're incompetent of running this company. -What are these antics, Mother? -My son is so bright. Have you never considered looking into the managing members... ...of the Calvary Company? Of course l have. -lt's Reynolds and Blanchett. -That is my maiden name. -l'm Blanchett. -Austin? Don't you remember your old colleague? -Nicholas? -Call me Nick. -What's going on? -Nick was one of the most powerful... ...stockbrokers in this company, until your little ego let him go. Apparently he's been advising Alice for years. lmagine my surprise when l found out... ...she has quite a few shares in this company. -l take it this is legit, right, Austin? -lt looks that way. So, Alice? l think you have been doing a fine job, Charlotte. l see no reason to change now. My sentiments exactly. Well, now that l have the controlling vote... ...there are a few changes effective immediately. Abby, l'd like for you to maintain as COO. And William, you're fired. Meeting adjourned. Mama, you're a millionaire? How come you didn't say anything? You never asked me. Meeting's adjourned. Come on. William. William. -What? -l've been calling you. -Yeah, l know. -You know? -What's going on? -l've been fired. l'm sorry. lt's okay. lt's okay. We can start-- We can start our own company together. Andrea, it's over. -lt's over? -Yeah. lt's all over. No, William. What do you--? What do you mean? -What are you talking about? -l'm not leaving my wife. -Got it? Excuse me. -No. No, wait. You can't do this. -Get your hands off. -You can't. William, no. You can't do this. Please. What are you talking about? We have a son. -Do we? -''Do we''? -William, we have a son. -Let go of me. -William? -Turn in your car. William. William, wait. William, wait! Wait, wait! Please. Hello? Yeah. Jesus. When Charlotte died, it brought a lot of hurt... ...tears and a lot of questions. l remember after my second child was born... ...she asked me, ''Alice Evans, '' as only she could say my name... ...she said, ''Are you living or are you existing?'' l didn't get what she was saying at the time. But this morning l could hear her voice... ...asking me that same question again. ''Are you living or are you existing?'' lt's funny what your mind goes back to when you're grieving. l told her after my girls were older, l would start having more fun. Then it was, ''After my children went off to college.'' Then it was, ''After l help with my grand baby.'' l would tell her, ''My children need me.'' But what l found in all these years of living is... ...no matter how much love and support you give your children... ...they are still human beings and you are not their only influence. l have spent my entire life giving it away. l think l'm gonna keep the rest of it for me. Death is a tragedy if you haven't lived. Thank you, Charlotte, for your life l hope you still feel small When you stand beside the ocean Whenever one door closes l hope one more opens Promise me You'll give faith a fighting chance And when you have the choice To sit it out or dance l hope you dance l hope you dance What do you say we just head north this time?
