Baby, how about you help Mommy cut up the fruit? - I wanna stay with Daddy. - Daddy's busy right now. - Come on, honey. - Where's Billy? I think he went out. Went to counsel four years ago, but... And there was such a backlog they forgot all about it. So they finally put it down and it's a two-way, not a four-way. - Unbelievable. - I know. Do those people know what they're doing down there? They don't. Is that baby kicking yet? - Oh, yes, he is. When he's hungry. - Dad, how's the food? - It's lovely. - We're gonna cut into that cake soon. - Yeah, looks great. I'll have some. Not yet. Not yet. I'm going inside for a minute. Anybody need anything? - No, I'm great, thanks. - No, thanks. - So. - Just back this morning, huh? Yeah, four hours ago. He looks great. Attention! Present! Attention! - Hi. - Hey. It's good to see you. We'll be inside. Hey, what's up? Hey, Tom. Hey. Hi. Where's Molly? We're not together. Dear John letter. You know how that goes. You look different. - Older? - Your eyes. They... It's like they're looking over my shoulder, you know? Sadder, maybe. Sorry. Was he a hero, Tommy? He died defending his country. That doesn't answer my question. - It's the truth. - Stop it. - You don't believe that. - Of course I do. He was doing his job. And he was damn good at it. Sorry. He's cute. When's he coming to see you? - I don't know. - What? He is fine. If you don't want him, then send him my way. Are you ready for therapy? Do I have a choice? Not if you wanna get out of here. Everything's gonna be okay. They'll page me when you're done. Good luck. Jordan had this stuff sent to me. I'm not sure why, but... Well, you were his buddy. He loved you, too, right? Right. God. I always hated this picture. He carried that with him everywhere he went. God. What's this? This is called a God's eye. Some kid in Baghdad gave it to him. - An Iraqi kid? - Yeah. I thought they all hated us. Not all of them. What's this one? It's the Combat Infantry Badge. These other two right here, they're from letters of recommendation but this is the CIB. It's one all the soldiers wanted. Means you fought hard. I gave this to him. There she is. Vanessa! Hi, honey. You look so grown up. Can you say "Hi" to Mommy? Yeah? Can you say "Hi" to Mommy? You look so thin. Hey. You look great. Yeah, Ray, right. Crackers are coming. What is the matter, Ray? How's it going? Has everybody got everything? Ray, crackers. Yeah, the crackers. Yes, they are right here. I'm sorry about that. Dede, that's really good how you stay inside the lines now. - Thank you, Daddy. I'm out. You're gonna be late. Davis is picking me up. I'll eat in the car. Seahawks have a game against the Patriots Sunday night. Perhaps you two should go. Both of them suck this year. Well, then maybe Dr. Benton won't be using his tickets. We can get the same ones we had last year, 10 rows up, 50-yard line, - spend the night in the city. - I'm busy. Busy doing what? Thought you liked football. Did you read that in one of your brochures or something? "Invite your child on favorite activities, "and re-establish familiar bonds." - Billy, what's gotten into you? - Mom! Give me a break. You guys are so obvious. I'm out. - Dede, go get your knapsack. - But I want Daddy to get it. Now, sweetheart. You all right? Yeah, sure. Did you sleep at all? Yeah. No, honestly, I did. - See you later. - Okay. The faculty wanted to do something, but we weren't really sure... It's okay, really. You sure you're ready for this? Yes, sir, I'm ready. Well, good luck. You were gone a while, Tommy. - Like a year. - Fifteen months, actually. There's kind of a law that says you have to hold my job until I get back. But I hired someone else. I had to. You were full-time. That's the point, Zander. This was my full-time job. You knew I was coming back eventually. I guess. I hoped so. You know what I mean. - Yeah. - Look, Tommy, I only have four employees. You know that. What did you think I was gonna do? Look, I'll put a word in with Tyson over at REl. No, don't worry about it. I need to find something closer to home anyway. Since I'm not gonna be crashing at Molly's anymore. I'm real sorry, man. Yeah, it's cool. You sure, now? 'Cause I don't want you going all psycho on me or anything. So how was it? You shoot anybody? Yeah, I did. Did you kill anybody? I don't know, Zander. I didn't stick around to find out. It's war. - Look, man, I gotta... - Sure. Look, you come back whenever, okay? Brock's Gun Shop. This is Zander. No. No, I'm sorry. We're all out of those. I can get them for you next week. Take any of the brochures now or you can come down to the recruitment center as we'd love to have you in the Army family. Shit! Hey, let me give you a hand. - It's all right. It's all right. It's okay. - I got it. It's all right. Just some mud on there. It's okay. It's okay. You must be Vanessa Price. Well, what gave that away? I'm Cary Wilkens. I teach boys' P.E., but I've been teaching your girls the last eight weeks. Long day? Yeah. Takes some getting used to. So, you wanna grab a cup of coffee or something? I could fill you in on your students... - I don't think so. But thanks. - You sure? - Yeah. No, I'm sure. - You know, some kids are mean... Okay. I got it. I got this. - Just trying to help. - I know, but I got it. It's nice to meet you, Vanessa. Fuck! Will? Scott Martinez hit a homerun in the 15th inning, won the game. Five hours. Unbelievable. Come back to bed, baby. Can't sleep. Don't you have surgery tomorrow morning? Will, what happened over there? I don't really remember. You know, it's like a dream. Hazy dream. Then tell me. I wanna know. Do you? Wanna know what a blast wound looks like? What an OR in the desert smells like? What really happens to them? How they die? You really wanna know? You want us to come back like nothing ever happened. You don't want to get your hands dirty with the details. That's not fair at all. Do you really think I don't care? If you wanna tell me, then tell me. And maybe you're right. Maybe I don't wanna hear about what happened to the rest of them. But I would like to know what happened to you. Two tickets. Here you go. There you go, - Hi. - Hey. How are you? Good, thanks. Two adults and one child for Forever Lulu at 1:30. All right. Okay, That is $20,50, Okay. Out of $21. There you go. I know you. Bravo Company, First of the 161st, Hua, Hua. You wanna go in and I'll be there in just a minute? I'll go... I'll be in right after you. Okay. Don't worry. I checked for snipers a couple hours ago. Jesus. - Cute kid. - Thanks. One day he acts up like you wouldn't believe and then the next he won't let me out of his sight. So how you doing? Okay. I lost my best friend over there. - God, I'm sorry. - Yeah. It's been pretty tough since... Fuck. They changed up my medication. It makes me all weepy. - Zoloft? - Lexapro. - Really? That makes me way too anxious. - Really? I had that problem with Risperdal. - Vicodin? - Every now and again. But I was actually on Resperidone, but then I got moved to Celexa. Now I take Ambien for sleeping. Ambien? Now come on. Trazodone all the way. Would you listen to us? We sound like a couple of junkies. You know, sometimes I can't sleep at night. - Yeah. - So I flip it over to The History Channel. I love The History Channel. - You watch The History Channel? - Yeah. The other night, it was like 4:00 a.m., and they had this special on D-day and Normandy, okay? And it was like, about these small towns, Caen and Bayeux, and how they loved Americans and they loved Allied soldiers. And they have statues of Eisenhower and plaques thanking the Americans. I don't know, I just started thinking that... I mean, what if like 10, 15 years from now, we go back... Do you think that they'll have statues thanking us and plaques and... 'Cause we saved them, we liberated them. Right. I don't know. Yeah. I don't know, either. You know, I work at this fucking movie theater and sell these stupid tickets for these stupid movies. But I don't ever go see any of them. Just seems all so unimportant, you know? Yeah, I know exactly what you mean. I mean, I see all these people driving these gas-guzzling SUVs, getting their Frappuccinos from Starbucks. Doing all this crap with their normal lives, and they don't give a shit what's going on over there. Yeah. I gotta tell you it makes me wanna go back there so goddamn bad. I know what you mean. I mean, I barely know you. But I'm sitting here with you and I feel like I've known you my entire life. Yeah. And then there's all those people that I actually do really know. And now, I just don't feel like I know them at all. I feel the exact same way. It's like nothing makes any sense anymore, does it? Yeah. On D-Day, behind Bradley's first army, another army is sent, Patton's third, He told them to get mad and stay mad, They listened, Giving credit, instilling pride, urging men to even greater deeds, Then, the green light, Kidding me. Watch where you're fucking going! Fuck with me. Get the fuck out of the way! You fucking turn? Who is this guy? Oh, Jesus. Shit. - Good morning, sweetheart. - What's up? - Hey. - Nice uniform. At least I won't get shot at. Depends on the movie theater. - He's in back. - Back. Damn it. I'll take a look. Hey, old man. Hey, Mike Falcone call you? Yeah. Said there's another exam a week from Saturday. And than I take the physical when my leg gets better. That sounds good, Tommy. - We'll see, I guess. - Look. Come on. Police is a good job. Did me right for 25 years. - Serving popcorn is no career. - Yeah. Yeah, I know. Look, you stay on top of it. $15,000 saved up isn't going to last forever. Hey, Pop, I'm doing it. All right? Relax. Your mother comes into your room sometimes at night and you're not there. I like to drive around. - In the middle of the night? - Yeah. You know, I... I've been thinking about going and talking to someone. About what? Your feelings? - You sound like your mother. - No! No, I just think of a lot of shit... Why don't you wait until you get the police job? Because they'll find out. And you don't want them thinking you're a pussy. What are you saying? 'Cause I'm not a pussy. Hey, buddy. What do you got? What is that? Hi. Hi. Hi. - Hey. - Hi. - Hey, babe. How're you doing? - Hey. Good. Hot, hot, hot, hot. Not bad, huh? Ray's staying for dinner. No, tonight's not a good night, actually. I'm just... I'm really tired. So, if we can just do it another time. Yeah. Yeah, sure. Sure. I'm gonna give you a call later, though, okay? - Yeah. - Okay. Thanks, Alice. See you, kid. Mommy. Get out of here, Oliver. But it's Ray. Tell him I'll call him back. We turned the. 50 cals on him. And he doesn't stop. He's coming right at us. He could have a bomb. We don't know. There's no way to know. But he doesn't stop. So I open fire. I have no choice. I tear him up. It's him or us, right? Then we drove by fast as hell and I looked back to see if I got him. Then we were gone. And you still think about it? - Yeah. Whether I really saw a woman, a girl and a baby all shot up... - So what's your problem then? - What do you mean? You did what was right. The rules of war were followed. There was an imminent threat. Haji didn't get the memo. Get over it. It's not always that simple. This is bullshit, man. They told me this was a class. I want information. I need my discharge paperwork and help with that, my disability applications and help with that. Some people think this is helpful. Whatever. You've got everything under control, right, son? When did you serve, Gettysburg? Saigon. Jesus. Thirty years out? No way in hell I'm gonna be coming back here. You're obviously angry, Jamal. - Do you wanna tell us why? - No, why don't you tell me why. Why what? Why I get these headaches and I still can't sleep right. Why I can't walk right because my back's still fucked up. Why Keisha wouldn't kiss me the first two months I was home? Why it takes the army six weeks to set the medical for my discharge and they canceled it and they rescheduled it and then canceled it again? Why I can't look at you right now without wanting to kick your face in? - Especially you, Doc. - Hey, Jamal, Jamal. What the hell happened to you, man? What, you want to pile some shit on me, too, Tommy? No, I'm not trying to pile anything on you. What the hell are you doing here? Tommy Daydream, ladies and gentlemen. Movie-star looks and a future so bright. - You two know each other? - Tell him. Tell him. Tommy takes one in the leg. His buddy gets a dozen in the chest. Well, God smiles down on Tommy Daydream. Fuck you, Jamal. Fuck you. Fuck me? No, fuck you. Yeah, go ahead. Get out. Get the fuck out. Get your own goddamn group. This is my goddamn group. Nobody else ain't got nothing else they wanna say? How's that? That hurts. I'm having pain all the time. - Pain or discomfort? - Pain. Because discomfort is nothing to worry about. Right there. All right. It's probably the prosthesis. We can try and adjust it. Thank you. And I can prescribe some medication to help with these phantom pains. No more medication. It's up to you. These just came in. You wanna take a look at that? I'll recommend some more therapy as well. What the hell is this? Take a look at the last one. Fishing attachment? $21,000? Don't worry about it. The army will pay for it. As many as you need. Might be something that you and your boyfriend or husband can do together. Help you pass the time. Do you think they have one where you can give people the finger? Or, maybe a flat palm with a spike in it? You know, for when I smack my kid around. Because when I really put my shoulder into this, this thing just goes flying across the room. It's kind of getting to be a little bit of a problem, Doc, you know? Because if I could just keep my kid in line, and not have to go digging for this thing then maybe, just maybe, I'd have a little bit more time for some fly-fishing. Thank you. No, thank you. It's your choice. Vanessa! Hey! Ray, what are you doing here? Your mom told me where you were. - Vanessa, this is crazy. - I just gotta go. Why don't you return my calls? Ray, you know why. No, I don't. I really don't. Wait a minute. Please, don't just walk away. It's over, Ray. - It's over. Don't you get it? - What did I do? At least tell me that. What did I do? It's not about you, it's about me. Okay. You wanna be alone? Fine. I've tried comforting you, I've tried giving you space. But you are just so damn determined to be pissed off at the world! I guess it only takes one good hand to push people away. Take care of yourself, Vanessa. Levels are good, steady. - Knife. - Doctor. Retraction. - Are you feeling all right, Doctor? - Respiration's steady. I am feeling a bit under the weather. Dr. Breeder, would you finish for me, please? - Yes, certainly. - Thank you. Dr. Marsh? There's a Vanessa Price here to see you. - Who? - She says she knows you from Iraq. Oh, my God! - Hi. - It's good to see you. - Come in. - You, too. Thanks. Thank you. How are you? Are you all right? Yeah, everything's fine. I had an appointment at the V.A. Hospital this morning, and one of the nurses there gave me your address. - Everything all right? - Yeah, it's fine. It's fine. I just... I thought about you, and I realized that you were in the neighborhood. So I took the day off of work and thought, "Well, you know, today I'm gonna do doctors." So, they couldn't save it, then. No. No. FST took it off. I spent the night in Baghdad, and then went over to Landstuhl. I mean, I don't remember it. It's just... It's just what they told me. - Then to Walter Reed? - Yup. Walter Reed for a month, fitted, and then back home. Walter Reed. Right? You wanna see some tough Americans. - Yeah, I can imagine. - Yeah. But I mean, I'm one of the lucky ones. I got my legs, I got most of my arms... I can hold my kid and I... And I really try to remember that. You must've seen a lot while you were there. Yeah, I saw a lot. You really look good. Thanks. You know, at Walter Reed, they took us on these outings to help us, you know, kind of, get used to it. And people would thank us, and then, you know, they would stare, and that would make me really, really angry. And then they would ignore me and it would make me really angry. - I just... I don't know... - Do you need anything? Prescription? Jesus, everybody's just trying to drug me. Oh, Jesus. I'm sorry. Look, I just thought maybe... I'm... I'm really not here for that. I just, you know, I really just wanted to see your face again. You're a hero. At least to me. Thank you. - Excuse me. - Sure. Dr. Marsh. What? Is he there now? Okay. All right, I'll be right over. I'm sorry, I have to go. It's good to see you. Thanks. You, too. If you're ever in the neighborhood again, you need anything, you know, call me, stop by. Thank you. The conduct policy's very clear. No baseball caps, no cell phones, no clothing with offensive pictures or slogans. No clothing with offensive pictures or slogans. Show them. Where did you get that? The mall. What's the big deal? We have teachers here who have friends and loved ones who've served in Iraq. They were quite upset. We can't have this here. - Well, actually, my husband's... - Can't have what, opposition? The garment is offensive, Dr. Marsh. Of course it is. That's the point. If you want to raise your children to oppose American institutions, I guess that's entirely your right. But this is a public school and we have rules. Okay, so why don't we have him take it off right now, you call an assembly and you can burn it, along with some books from the library and today's newspaper. - Will... - And while we're at it, let's get a list of all the students who are opposed to the war, make them come to school on Saturday and take patriotism classes and monitor their e-mails and their cell-phone calls. Dr. Marsh! Buck Fush? Buck you, you son of a bitch. - Will! - Let's go. Come on. Come on. Hey, that was really cool, Dad. Yeah, well, you're grounded for a month. What? We'll talk about it when we get home. So you're against the war, huh? You don't know a damn thing about it. It's not a war, it's an occupation. They hate us. They're trying to build a country. We did the same thing here a couple of hundred years ago. - It's not easy. - Yeah. Right. And we're doing a good job at it. Maybe if we flushed a couple more Korans down a toilet in Guantnamo, it'd help them speed things up. So you think we should just leave, huh? Let them rip each other to pieces? It's not an easy decision, is it? Some bad guys over there, Billy. Dad, what bad guys? What is this, a Schwarzenegger movie? - Hey. - Why don't you just admit it, we went over there for oil and everything else is just bullshit. - Watch your mouth. - That's the problem with you people. You're never wrong, are you? We're not wrong. Since when did our country decide it was our job to just piss everybody else off? You don't know what the fuck you're talking about. - Will. - You should read a history book. I will, when you go read a newspaper! I don't have to. I was there! Let's go now. No, you're walking. - What? - Fine! Keisha. Where's Keisha? Keisha. - There you go. - Thanks. Keisha, I wanna talk to you for just a minute. Jamal, I'm working. I know you're working. I just need to talk to you for a minute. - I promise I won't get upset. - Leave me alone. Leave me alone. The handle broke off the kitchen cabinet again. Can you take a look at it after dinner? Sure. Where's Dede? She's eating at Jenna's. You don't know her. Can you get this, honey? Thank you. You know if you cut the brake lines on the car, I can't fix that. What're you talking about? I don't think it was good for you defending Billy in there today. Half the kids in that school can't read, and they're worried about what's written on some damn T-shirt. I'm worried about our son. Don't. He hates me. He hates that you're in the military. All 15-year-olds hate their parents. I guarantee, if I was a pacifist he'd be in Fallujah by now. You're driving me crazy. You need to stop breaking stuff around the house. - I know what you're doing. - I'm trying to get through to you. You're not helping me, Pen. You're making me feel like a mental patient. - Now there's an idea. - Very funny. You smelled like a bar at Billy's school. Do your patients know? I am handling it. - Now leave me alone. - No, I will not leave you alone. I'm sorry. Do you think you're the only one who's had it rough? I was the one who got up every single morning and went online to check that casualty list. And I was the one who got sick to my stomach every time I heard about another roadside bomb. And who do you think told our daughter every night that Daddy wasn't coming home tomorrow or the next day, or the day after that, but that he still loved her and me? Now I understand you feel compelled to serve and I supported that. Hell, I left my job and got another one just so one of us would be home some of the time with our daughter! And when you asked to extend your deployment, I supported that, too. Because I think what you did was right and noble. But I did not spend the last eight months of my life in sheer hell for you to come home and be an asshole! This is the third time I've been back and forth here. I got a problem with my back, okay? I don't get around good. I'm going back and forth, downtown, back here, downtown, back here, and I sit here and come talk to you people. And you sit here looking at me like you don't understand what the fuck I'm talking about! Somebody here got to have information. Don't tell me this is the first damn discharge papers you've seen! And you're sitting there like you don't understand what the fuck I'm saying! Somebody better tell me something in this motherfucking... Hey, Doc. Hey, how you doing? Hey, I'm good. I'm good. You? I'm great. Hey, you remember me? You helped wash out my leg. - Yeah. Yeah. - Yeah. - Good to see you. - Yeah. You okay? Yeah, yeah. I'm supposed to meet a patient here. Actually, pick up a prescription for a patient. They don't really hand that shit out. Yeah, well. It's more of a consult. I can't really talk about it. Right, right. There's some good people there. I'm sure whoever needs a consult, that'll really help. Yeah. - Good to see you. - It was good seeing you, too. Fight! Hey, you! Hey. All right, enough. Stop it. Break it up right, you two! Right now! Stop it! Hey! Hey! That's it! That's it! Move! Move! - You all right? - I'm fine. - Come on, let's go. - I said I'm fine. - Let's go back to class! Come on. - Okay, it's over. Just go back to class. Go. - Damn it, Oliver! - I'm sorry, Mommy. I'm sorry. Come here. Come here. Why are you crying? Mommy just gets a little bit sad sometimes. - You mad at me? - I didn't mean to yell. But I love you. I love you so much, baby. - Hello, - Hi. Is Cary there, please? Yeah, this is Cary, Who's calling? Oh, hi. This is Vanessa Price. - I'm really sorry to be calling this late. - No, No, it's all right, It's just... I could really use your help. Well, yes, sure, You wanna talk? Yeah. How about tomorrow before school? We can grab some coffee or something, Great. Great, thank you. Hello. What? Where is he? All right. Been in there for about an hour. Kept asking for you. You guys work together or something? Yeah. Yeah, we worked together. You don't have to go in there if you don't want to. It's all right. Jamal! - What's up, man? - I'm coming in, all right? What're you doing, man? I don't know, boss. Just like the job, this wasn't working out. What job is that? The job at this dealership, man. You know about that. Right. Right. She wouldn't see me. Who wouldn't see you? Keisha. She wouldn't see me, so I had to make her see me. You know what I'm saying? Yeah. Thought she was one of them, Tommy. Like I turned and wasn't no time. They don't give you no time. Right. Jamal, what do you say we go back to the center, and we'll talk to someone, get some help. - You come with me? - Yeah. Yeah, I'm coming with you. First you gotta give me that gun. I like my gun. I know you like your gun. But come on, man, you don't wanna do this. I'll come with you. Anything for you, Daydream. Oh, shit. Got movement. - Shit! - Jamal! Jamal! God damn it! Jamal! Fuck! Damn it! Jamal. Go! Go! Go! Mike Falcone called me. He said you never showed up for your appointment at the Academy. Yeah. I thought it was, like, a possible... He was holding a spot for you. - Jesus, Tommy! - So maybe I'm not ready yet, even if you want me to be ready. What I want you to stop watching Band of Brothers, smoking dope - and playing video games all day! - Fine. Maybe I should just re-enlist, huh? Maybe that's all I'm really fucking good at is fucking killing people! - Stop feeling sorry for yourself. - Fuck you! You don't know what it's fucking like over there! You don't know what the fuck I went through! Fuck you! Stay the fuck away from me. - Damn! - Stop! - It's okay. - I couldn't get to him... It's okay. Don't. Don't. It's okay. I couldn't save... Couldn't save him. It's okay. It's okay, Tommy. It's all right, Tommy. - You all right, Dede? - We're gonna wait for your father. What the hell? Can't work on a holiday. Think I ate too much. Penelope, hello. Come on, come on, come on. Will, where have you been? Look, this is Hector, Rodrigo and... I forget. But they were working on Thanksgiving so I invited them to our house for dinner. Baby, we have guests. My father... - Carl, hey! - Will. - How're you doing, man? - Baby, go lie down. No, no, no. It's Thanksgiving. You don't lay down on Thanksgiving. Come on, come on, guys. Come on, let's eat. Hey, everybody. Happy Thanksgiving. You know what? Since it's Thanksgiving, I think I should say a few words. Don't worry. Hold on, hold on. I know, you're all thinking, "Is he gonna do or say something crazy? What? "The drunk, violent fool "back from a year in the desert." Yeah, but don't worry. Don't worry. I'm not going to do anything like that. I know I get drunk, and I get angry and it can get to be a bit much. But that's how I'm dealing with it. If that impacts on your life in a bad way, then I'm sorry. And I'm gonna make it right. I promise. But we're not gonna talk about that. Let's talk about what we're thankful for. And I'm thankful for my family and my friends. And my new friends. And I'm also thankful that I live in a country where I can eat till I'm full three times a day, seven days a week. And I'm thankful for two-ration beef with mushroom sauce, and heat and dust and roadblocks and Haji Pepsi, and kids who run up and hug you, and kids who spit at you, and mothers having babies faster so they can grow up to kill you. And the boys, who are young and brave and scared, and the Kevlar propped against upside-down M-16s with boots next to them, Boys with wives and fiances and babies and mothers and fathers. Boys who just wanna come home. And they do come home, maimed and haunted and fucked up, if they come home at all. But, hey, hey, it's Thanksgiving. Let's eat, enjoy ourselves. - Carl, you saved me that drumstick? - Of course, Will. All right. Come on, come on, guys. Let's get something to eat now. Come on. Grab some of these good comidas, Mi casa es su casa, Come on. This is great. Thanksgiving. All right. Hey, what is that? What the fuck is that? - Dad, what're you doing? - What is that! Back off me! - Get over here, boy. - I'm... I'm... - Get away from me! - What's with you? It's okay, baby. - He pulled it out. - My God. Will. Put it down. We'll get you help. Think about me and Dede. We all grew up together, Me and Jordan, we lived on the same block, He and I used to play football, basketball, Anyway... He died in Al Hayy. We just got word we were coming home. We were all pretty excited, you know? Yeah. He was my buddy, you know? And I didn't get to him in time, And when, when I was holding him, when I was holding him, it wasn't like I saw his eyes close or you know, anything like that. I just felt this... Just felt this vibration and he was gone. And now, now I've been back for, you know, some time now, trying to make sense of all the shit. What I do know is, I don't belong here anymore. Shit. Right here, Rudy. Over the top. We don't have to talk about the war today, We've made some good progress, Even coming in here was a good first step, It's not like they gave me a choice, Doctor. No, it's okay. I wanna tell it, actually. I'd been in Balad about a month. Was 130 degrees, sand was in everything. It was awful. We heard mortars all the time, but we never got anything serious. I'd just finished a 12-hour shift. I was exhausted, ready to go to sleep. When all hell broke loose. Look alive, people! Heads up! Let's hit it! Let's go! Incoming CASEVAC! MASSCAL situation! What's your name, son? Pulse 120. Let's get a tie-off here. I need two units of plasma to this soldier right away! How you doing, soldier? Pulse rapid and thready! Let's get some QuickCIot over here now! Hold your head up, son. Come on, help me! I'm hit! Radio for help! Okay, you'll be okay. Go outside. Go outside. Go. You guys, you can't be in here. I need that blood back here now! Medevac's on its way from Taji. - ETA? - One minute. - Somebody alert the chaplain. - Okay. - Please get off me! - All right. I need you guys to wait outside. No, no, no! We're not fucking waiting! You all got to fix him. Do something. Fix him, Doc! I will do that, but I need you to go outside. - Motherfucker, you fix him... - Just calm down. What are you doing? - Blood pressure's dropping. - I need that QuickCIot now! Starting chest compressions. Go! Elevate. Elevate. Put his legs up. I amputated six arms and legs in three hours. Four soldiers died on the table, all under the age of 20. I mean, I saw all that... And I'll always have that. But there's that... that moment when you realize you can't help someone, and you feel heartbreak. And then the shame because you couldn't do your job. It was an unusual situation. A crisis. During war... Doctor, I know all that, but it's not about that. It's... I don't feel anything. I'm supposed to feel something, right? When you treat a patient you're supposed to feel something. Well, I don't feel anything. I didn't even know their names. You know, I was kind of surprised you called me, actually. After what you were like that first day... - Really? - You don't remember this? You don't remember this? That first day when I'm helping you out at the car. You were like, "I'm fine. I'm fine. Leave me alone." - I kind of remember that. Yeah. - You remember that? - I'm sorry. - That's all right. I'm just giving you a hard time. I know, but that's really kind of inexcusable. No. I just have a really hard time trusting people. - You haven't been seeing anybody? - You mean like a shrink? No, no. I meant, have you had a boyfriend since you got back? No. I was seeing somebody before I left, but that just didn't work out. What happened to your hand? We were in this city, in Al Hayy, and I was part of a convoy of trucks. We were driving into the city. It was hot as hell, and dusty and horrible and... Just driving into the center of the city and something started to go really weird. And the truck in front of us... The trucks in front of us, they got ambushed. So the rest of us, we took another road to try to get back around to the main road that we were on. And I saw this little kid, with a Tootsie Pop or something. I don't know what he had. I just remember this kid. And we turned this corner and we just drove and... Explosion. Just a big explosion. And it was a... It was just a bomb on the road, on the side of the road. I don't remember anything. Just that I was told I was... I was very lucky. I have a confession to make. I wasn't helping you that day because of your hand. It's 'cause I thought you were... 'Cause I thought you were so beautiful. - Beautiful? - Mmm. What? What. I don't know. Beautiful? And divorced at 24 and one kid and one hand. Especially with one kid and one hand. Hey. - Hi. - Hi. You all right? Let's just take it slow, okay? Yeah. - I'm sorry. - It's okay. It's all right. Hold on. All right. - Do you wanna get that? - I'll get that. I'll get this. - All right, now what? - Just that... - Just pull that. - It's stuck. I'm trying to pull it. It's definitely stuck. How do you do this? I don't know, I've never done this before. Fuck it. Stop laughing. This is serious. I was thinking maybe we could talk. Okay. I'll talk and you can just listen. I'm sorry about what I did. I was wrong. I've got some issues. And I'm getting some help with that. In fact, your mom and I are seeing someone and we think that at some point down the road it'd be good if you went with us maybe once or twice. Dede, too. But you can make up your mind about that when the time comes. I know you're against the war. And I can respect that. But are you against the war in principle or because I was part of it? Both. - Well, I talked to him. - Good. - So what you doing? - Paying bills. Nothing important. I love you. I love you, too. Can you look at me when you say that? I love you. I love you very, very much. Thank you. Bye. Dear Mom and Dad, I know you don't understand why I re-enlisted, It's confusing and scary for all of us, I know that, But I have to go back, I don't wanna die and Jordan didn't wanna die, either, And maybe when we went over there the first time we didn't know what we were getting into, Maybe the leaders of our country didn't know what they were getting into, Maybe the people don't want us there, Maybe this whole thing is just making it worse, But even after all that, I can't stay behind knowing there are soldiers over there getting attacked every day and dying every day, I don't feel like it's wrong of me for wanting to go back over there and help them, It's a hard job being a soldier, Not just for people like me, but for the people we leave behind, The both of you, girlfriends, kids, husbands and wives, We all carry scars of war, But I know that if I do my part then maybe we'll all get out of there and get home to the people who love us just a little bit quicker, - This is my wife, Penelope. - Hello. - Daughter, Dede... - Hello. ...and that's Billy. - Nice to meet you. - How you doing? Great game today. - Thank you. We're going to get something to eat now. - You guys wanna go? - Sounds good. I hope this can make sense to you, Because it makes perfect sense to me, These are my guys and I need them just as much as they need me, I'm not trying to be noble or brave, But I feel, if I don't go then I'd fail Jordan, Jamal, and all those who went over with me and sacrificed so much, And that'd be worse than never coming home at all, I know you aren't happy with this, but I also know that you love me, I'm going back, And I'm going back to do the best job I know how, And get back to you as soon as I can, Pray for me,
