Who's been-- Oh my god. Something went wrong. It didn't work like it was supposed to. Something in the calculations... I don't know. Please! I don't have time to explain! You have to go! Stay in here. Don't open this door no matter what happens. And stay quiet. I know what you are looking for, But they're not here. They're safe until I can figure this out. please... you don't have to do this. I just need a little more time. But I promise, I'll make those better. Randolph... oh my god. I'll get help! No. There's not enough time. I need... What? Behind you. The key in my pocket. Get out of the country. As soon as you can. Go to your family. Stay there. Do it. President Barack Obama. The... ...treatment isn't working, Susan. I had hoped... ...we would get better results with this, but... ...we'll need to do more tests, And where we go from here... ...your white count is still incredibly-- How long? Well... ...that really depends on-- How long? At this rate, ...months. 6 to 10 at the most. Hey... Hey. Thanks. Any messages? No. It's been quiet. Okay. Did you check the online bins? Yeah. Everything that needs to be mailed is here. Good. I'm gonna close a little early, so, you can go. What did the doctor say? Nina, you can go. Looking for anything in particular? I dunno. Does this stuff work? It depends on what you need it for. And if you believe in it. What about miracle cures? You got any of those? Well... Umm... These -- These won't perform any miracles, But, They'll give you some comfort if that's what you're looking for. Well, I have pills for that. C'mon, where are the magic rocks, Or whatever it is you're supposed to have here? Sorry. I sold my last bag of fairy dust about an hour ago. This was a mistake. I'm sorry. Look, if you tell me why you're here, I could probably help you a little better. Okay. I have less than a year to live. I'm sorry. I-- Yeah. Shouldn't-- Me too. Just... gimme everything you've got there. I like your locket. Where'd you get that? Hmm? This. Oh. It's-- It's from the breath capture line. What's breath capture? You open it up, You take a deep breath, You exhale into the pendant. You seal it up, And then you give it to someone. Why? So you can stay close to them, I guess. My boyfriend gave me this one. It's becoming quite trendy. We'll even engrave it for you if you want. Are you interested? No... no one to give it to anyway. That'll be 67. Dollars? Hi Josh. What? You can't say hi to me? Hi Morgan. Weren't you wearing the same thing yesterday? And the day before? And every day before that? Hey. You actually gonna buy something this time? No? I didn't think so. So get the fuck out! Bye. Thanks. Oh... It was getting kinda dreary in there. Thought I'd spruce it up a little. Thanks. Hey. It's all locked up. Drink? It's not lighting. Smoke? Seriously, Nina. We need to talk about a couple of things. No. Why not? I'm not ready yet. You shouldn't be either. I really just... ... want you to be prepared. Something could still happen. Nothing short of a miracle. I appreciate your optimism though. Don't give up, Sue. I mean... you never know what's gonna happen. Something you haven't thought of yet Could fall right into your lap. Hello. Can I help you? Yes. I hope you can. I saw an item on one of your online auctions. And I was just wondering if you were selling it in the store. Which item? It's for a small wooden box. About 10- 12 inches. Yeah. I know the one. I don't think there's a key for it though. That's okay. I was also wondering if you acquire items at live auctions. There is this book I've been trying to get my hands on... For a while. Right there. I can't make it myself. I'm gonna be out of town, but... I wanted to know if I could hire you to go in my place... ... and bid for me. I do go to auctions, But I don't usually go this far. Okay. Here's the thing: It's very important to me... this item. I can go as high as $20,000. So... I mean if you could get it for less, that's great. Y'know, you can just... keep the rest for yourself. Commission. Okay. I need to check to see if there are any bids on the box. And if not, I'm happy to sell it to you. Okay. I cannot guarantee you anything with the book, though. Auctions can be tricky. Something wrong? No. Something's wrong... damnit! No, you know what? I just remembered... the item isn't actually here... ... in the store. Umm... I had to take some things over to the photographers' Before I could actually list them. My, uhh -- camera just kinda crapped out on me. So, I just need to make arrangements to go and pick em up. That's all. Okay. Okay. Who do I make it out to? Lou? Oh -- I'm sorry. Who do I make the check out to? I'm Susan... it's Second Chances. That's... the name. Second Chances... There ya go. Mr. Collins -- No. The bidding's gonna be fierce on that, But that should be enough. You'll put the box aside for me? I'll just pick everything up when I come back? Okay. I would deposit that as soon as possible. I know it's gonna take a few days to clear. Okay. Here we go. Thanks very much. Appreciate it.

He came to prominence as one of the community's leading doctors, Heralding a field of study -- Heralding a field of study... dealing with ways to heal... incurable diseases and prolong life. Interesting item. Yeah, it is. Thinking of bidding? No. I'm not much of a collector. Maybe you wouldn't mind telling me why you canceled my online bid. It was for a small box. You are the owner of Second Chances, right? Yeah. I know the one. You're Poe, right? Alex Poe. Susan Jordan. And, it's not against the rules. Yes, I know. I just thought it was curious that You would turn down such a generous offer. Now we're both here, Looking at this book, but... that's just happenstance, I suppose.

Alright. Right now! No vomiting? No pains of any kind? No. Nothing. You seem to have made a total recovery. I'm all better? Just like that? From what I can see... you're in complete remission. There's not a trace of it left. That's great! But let's not get ahead of ourselves here. I'd still like to do some more tests just to make sure -- No. No more tests. No more pills. No more needles. No more nothing. This might seem like a dumb question, But... do you feel alright? Do I feel alright... I feel better than alright. I feel great. Did you get laid or something? Nina! Whatever you're doing, keep it up. It's six. I'm outta here. Hello? Hi. Miss Jordan. Miss Jordan, are you there? Yeah. I'm here. It's Raif Collins. I just wanted to come by and get my items. Now? Yeah, if it's not a problem. Actually I wanted to show you my appreciation and treat you to dinner. Assuming everything went well at the auction. Dinner? You want dinner now? You -- Dinner? Yeah. Are -- Are you okay? I'm fine. I have to do something. Okay. I can be there in an hour. Is that enough time? Miss Jordan? Yeah. That's fine. Yeah. That'd be fine. Okay. I'll see you then. Bye. Shit. Oww! Hello. Hey, it's me. I'm right outside. Yeah. Okay, fine. So... no problems? No... none. Great. That's great. What happened to your finger? My what? Your -- Your finger. I cut it. Okay. Uhh... so... Can I -- Can I have em? My items... Oh. Yeah yeah yeah. There she is. Wow. What do you know. Is something wrong? No, no, no. It's just... it's not really what I was... hoping for. Thanks though. Thanks for everything you've done. Thank you. Sure. No problem -- Where is it? Where's what? Don't -- Don't -- Don't... "Where's what?" You didn't open it, did you? No. You didn't open it, did you? No. C'mon. No. No. Yes, I -- Look, I -- I promise I will find a way to pay you back. I -- I have to go now. Hello again. Is there something I can do for you? Well we were just in the neighborhood, And decided to patronize your humble establishment. Very ecclectic. That was quite the spirited display you put on the other night. Very dramatic. It was -- "Hold on, hold on!" "Wait, wait, wait!" "Wait just a sec!" "Stop right there." "Stop. Right. There." She reaches in her purse. The suspense builds. A collective shudder from the crowd, and then... edging me out. By this much. It was painful. I have to say. What is it you want, Mr. Poe? That's what I like. A woman who likes to get right down to it. The box and the book. Not for sale. I think you misunderstand me. I'm not offering to buy them. How about now? No? You look different. When we met at the auction the other day, You seemed... a bit ragged, and now you... I apologize for the mess. In case you change your mind. Hello. Miss Jordan, it's Raif Collins. Please don't hang up. I just -- I just wanted to apologize for the way I acted the other night. No. You know what? If anyone should be apologizing, it's me. Well, that may be, but, That's not why I'm calling. Would you consider getting together with me again? There's something I'd like you to see. Come in! Hey. Hey. Can I get you anything? No. I'm fine. Look. I just wanted you to know, I started making preparations for paying you back. I'm sure you have. I'm not very worried about it. This is nice. Yeah. We do alright, eh? Who's "We"? That's why I wanted you to come over tonight. There's somebody I want you to meet. This is my sister. Christina. I'm sure she'd say hi, but... she hasn't really been able to... ... talk for some time now. The doctors haven't -- Haven't been any help. They just keep telling me... "any day now", or, "It won't be long now", but, I haven't given up hope. She has her good days. Every now and again she comes around. I'm not even... I'm not really sure if she knows who I am anymore. I have a nurse... ... that stays here with her during the week. So she doesn't feel so... ... alone. I just wanted you to understand why I blew up at you the other night. That's all. I thought it was the money this whole time. If I had known that it was -- I know. I know. After Christine's health declined, I began researching alternative methods of treatment. Most were worthless, but, One was pretty interesting. The Romans believed that The soul escaped the body with the last breath. Sometimes they would preserve it in bottles, Or a family member would inhale it at the moment of death. That's breath capture. You've heard of it? Yeah. This new age store that I went to, Was selling these little charms that you could breathe into, And give em to someone. I mean, it's bullshit. I mean I thought it was bullshit... until I found this. I found an article that he wrote in a medical journal. Where he just goes... on, and on, and on about how... breath capture would save millions of lives. There's just no proof that he ever actually did it. Except for you. At least now we know it would've worked on Christine. I know I said this, But I really want you to know how sorry I am. Listen... I'll make you a deal. There could be more of these vials out there. Or maybe the key to how Kaminsky made it work. With your connections, you're in a much better position than I am to -- To find em. So do -- Do this for me. Help me save Christine. And we'll worry about the money later. I don't care about that nearly as much as I do about her. Deal? Okay. Hello. Hey. Busy in here, huh? A little bit. What's up, Nina? I was... I was just wondering if you could tell me where you shop, cause... I'd sure like Morgan to start dressing like that. It turns me on. Get outta here, Josh. Why? I'm serious. It's just... you might wanna do something about those blackheads though. I'm not too big on that. Bye. Stop! Don't ever fucking touch me! Call the fucking cops, Morgan! I wouldn't do that if I were you. Unless you wanna explain this. I'll get you for this. I'll fucking get you for this, you crazy bitch! What are we still driving around for? I need to get to a hospital. The bitch knocked out my teeth. Morgan. I'm gonna get her. Her and that ugly little bitch. I'm gonna get em both. It's her. Lady, what is your fucking deal? Where have you been? Look at me. Everything's gonna be okay. Just tell me what's going on. I don't even remember drawing those, And then there's this noise in my head and... ... everything goes blank. And this was after you used the vial? And those people who busted up the shop... that's what they wanted? Yeah. Then let's go see them. Nuh uh. Just you. It's alright, Ruby. I was beginning to wonder if you'd ever show up. Yeah, well, My circumstances have changed a little bit since the last time we met. Blackouts? Personality changes? Something like that. What else? This is what else. So now you've come looking for answers. What makes you think I have them? When you came into my shop that day, you knew. You knew I had opened that vial. Do you know what free radicals are? Free radicals are the molecules in our bodies. Which cause aging. And they have everything to do with what's happening to you. In the 30's, A doctor named Randolph Kaminsky held a test study. It was for a new drug he developed Which was supposed to eliminate free radicals... creating longevity, And healing incurable diseases. Kaminsky had a hard time finding volunteers, though. So, he made a deal with the penal system. The inmates on death row were offered parole Or a reduced sentence if they volunteered to be the lab rats. What he didn't tell the inmates... ... was what the drug would actually do. He gave it to them... ... and they died. Instantly. The drug only worked if it had a chemical reaction inside the body first. Something about the breath exhaled at the moment of death made it work. He collected them. And the other half of the group, Who were all suffering from terminal illnesses, Including Kaminsky himself, Inhaled them. And they were cured. If it's a cure, Then why am I having these violent urges, And these visions of people being murdered. What you didn't know, Was the one that inhaled the breath of those inmates, Would get something besides longevity. New personalities? And memories. This is most likely the formula for the drug. Is there a way to reverse this or not? The only way to reverse what's happening to you is inhale another vial. Kaminsky may have had more of them in his possession. He's the only one who knew where they were. Which means... you're the only one who knows. The vials would have a certain market value. So we... ... may be able to help each other. Did you come to do the other side today, or..? Two Baltimore men were sentenced to 15 years in federal prison today For attempting to sell an undercover officer $40 worth of cocaine. So you were right. There are more vials out there. You found one? No. But if we can figure out where they are, Then we can help your sister. Susan, that's great! There's only one thing: she's gonna have to inhale two of them. One to cure her, And then one to reverse it. It's hard to explain, But it's at least worth a shot. Yeah... yeah. Where do we look? I don't know. If you want, we can talk about it over dinner. My treat this time. I gotta get my keys. Okay. Police are asking for your help tonight in finding The assailant of two teenagers who were found murdered in Cherry Hill. Morgan Raif, and Josh Foster, both 18, Were found slain in an abandoned lot just outside of Baltimore, Victims of a brutal stabbing. Police are asking anyone with any information related to these deaths To please come forward. Hey. What's up? I have to go. I'm sorry. What are you doing? I cannot explain. I just have to go. Sue? Where are you going? To find something. Susan, how did you know this stuff was here? Kaminsky knew. I can't explain. Let's go. Hold your breath. Do not breathe in. No matter what. I thought they said that breathing in another vial would reverse it. This is something different. This is something else. You have to go. You have to get out of here now! I'm telling you something is wrong and I can't control it. You have to go now! Nina, I don't want you coming back here until this is all over. Do you understand me? I can help you figure this out. No. If anything ever happened to you I would never forgive myself. I want you to go home, And I want you to stay there until I call you. This is my sister, Christine. You know, I told you I would call you. Hey, it's Raif. I think we should get together and Talk about why you ran out of here the other day. I -- I can't. I have to go. Who the hell are you people? Susan. Calm down! Calm down? I found a film. That bit -- About breathing in a second vial -- That was all bullshit! There is no way to reverse this, is there? You said that all of the vials are from inmates. You never mentioned anything about psychotics. The ones we breathed in were from the inmates. The others were supposed to be for the next test group. Well thanks to you leaving out that little tidbit, My friend almost died helping me get them. Hey wait. You found them? What the hell do you want with em? What is it? Some life long dream of yours to be a fucking mental patient? Of course not. We want them destroyed. Answers. Now. I told you Kaminsky was trying to increase longevity. It worked. Immortality? No no no. We can be killed. But we'll never get sick, we'll never grow old. Neither will you. Oh. I'll just be a fucking murderer. Susan, we were in the same boat as you. The violent tendencies, the blackouts. But, together, we beat it. So can you. There was another patient in the film: a man. What? He's the one who gave me this. And this. He wanted us to help him kill Kaminsky, And get the formula for the drug. And we refused. He didn't take it well. He was the only one of us that seemed to get off on it. The power of killing. We never saw him again after that. He's the one that paid me for Kaminsky's breath box in the first place. That's why i canceled your bid. He's alive? Look. If you're serious about destroying these, I'm with you. I swear to god, if you fuck with me -- No no no. We're serious. What's wrong? They aren't here. Where are they? I dunno. They were here. Shit. Shannon. He's not here. He was. Ugh. What is that? Oh god. Hey. Long time no see, huh? This isn't a reunion. Where are the vials? I don't have any vials. Bullshit. You broke into the store. And you took them. Where are they? Hi. You people amaze me. For being as... for being as smart as you are, You're all being a little short sided, don't ya think? We're sitting on one of the greatest discoveries known to man, And all you can do is resist it. Do you have any idea the applications this thing has? The medical possibilities... Alone... are... astounding. Yeah, and Morgan, and Josh, and that woman upstairs. What were they? Just part of your noble fucking cause? I had to improvise when you opened the vial. You stupid bitch. So, don't put that shit on me. They were assholes anyway, man. You should be thanking me. You should be saying, "Thank you. Thank you, Raif." What do you got there? I'm only gonna ask you this once more. Then it gets ugly. And try to keep in mind... that those violent tendencies... they never really go away. Where are the vials? Wait. Will you listen to me for a second? Think about what you're doing here. There's a lot of money to be made here. A lot. We can all have a part in it. C'mon, a product... that lets you be a completely new... ... person. Who wouldn't want that? People will pay anything... ... to get this. We deserve it after what he did to us. Hold him. C'mon, hang on a second. C'mon! Make sure his mouth stays open. Where are they? Fuck. You. We don't want it to get infected. Now... Let's try this again, shall we? Where. Are they? Or shall we see what hole I can fit this into? Hi, it's Raif. I'm not here so leave a message. Hi, Mr. Collins. It's Eve from the new age store. I've been trying to get in touch with you, but I guess you're busy. Hello. Oh, hi. Is Mr. Collins there? He's kind of tied up right now. Okay. Can you give him a message for me? I just wanted to thank him for bringing those in today. One day, and they're almost all gone. Do you know if he has any more? I don't... what are you talking about? The breath vials he brought in. I've sold almost all of them. I just wanted to find out if he had any more on hand. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. You have them? Of course. I'll call you back. What is it? What did you do? What did you do? I told you. I don't have them. I already have a few buyers. They just wanted to see it in action first. So... I'm just gonna finish what Kaminsky started. But... I'm conducting my... ... test on a slightly larger scale. Ruby. Keep him here. Who all's going over? Sounds good, but, I can't, I'm... ... going out with Ashley tonight. Yeah I got her this dumb ass charm that you breathe into or something. She's into all that romantic shit, So this should definitely score me some points. Oh, she's here. I'll call you back. So what's up, Ash? Hopefully you. Hey, I gotta call Tim back. Alright? I'll be back here in a minute. Yeah. I'll give you the details. Don't worry. Alright. Later. Ash? Where are they? Where's what? The vials Mr. Collins brought in. They went really fast. I couldn't believe it. Is this all that's left? Yeah. Do you keep track of who buys your merchandise? No, not really. People pay cash. There's no need. Why? -- Hey! How'd that cut heal up? All better now? Probably about the same as your shoulder. I dunno. I remember slicing you pretty deep. You don't treat something like that... right away... it's gonna end up lookin' real fuckin' nasty. Maybe I'll give you one just like it. I don't think so. Nothing personal. Susan, it's Nina. Look. I came to the store cause I didn't know where else to go. Just call me back when you get this. Okay? It simply isn't safe to enter what they're now calling "The hot zone". Again, if you're just joining us, We're coming to you live from Hamsted, Maryland, Where chaos has broken out in this normally quiet community, Apparently due to some type of unknown infection. Swat and hazmat units are on the scene, And police are urging everyone to stay away from this area. If you are in the hot zone, They're asking that you call the number at the bottom of your screen. Outbreak hotline. Who am i speaking to? Hello, my name is Nina Carver. I'm inside the hot zone. Can you gimme your exact location? Yes. I'm at a curio shop at King's Crossing -- Hey. You alright? Yeah. Thank god. I thought -- What are you doing? Waiting for your friends. Hey, there you are. Traffic? Surprised you made it. Sounds like world war III out there, eh? Wow, where's... where's Ruby? Oh! She won't be joining us. Ever again! No! Whoa whoa whoa. Easy. Easy, fella. It's just Ruby. Right? There's no reason to involve her in this. Okay okay okay okay! Just tell us what you want. I want what's in your stupid fuckin' head. The drug Kaminsky created. Okay? And I got all the time in the world. We can stay right here til you remember it. I have nothing to do. You have any plans? For leaving? Okay. Okay. Here. There it is. Show me. Show me. Let's go! Alright. Okay. Let's go! Okay. Ah-Ah-Ah-Ah! C'mon, man. Really? Did she just tell you to do that? That's a stupid fuckin' move. Open it. Open it! See? See? Alex! Don't move! Don't move! Get your hands up! Lemme see your fuckin' hands! Don't shoot. Hold your fire. Is everybody alright? Police are reporting today. That the outbreak of violence today in the community of Hamsted. Has been brought under control. At this hour, 150 are known dead. With over 60 others suffering minor wounds. But still no word on the cause of the outbreak of violence. The source of last night's horrific event. Is still under investigation. Hey. I thought you might need this. Oh. Thanks. I'll add it to my collection. When she's 60, I'm still gonna be this age. I'm just not real sure how I'm gonna deal with that. It does get easier. The violent urges never completely go away, But, you can learn to resist them. Ruby helped me. I'll help you. Is that what I think it is? Yep. What are you gonna do with it? I'll show ya.
