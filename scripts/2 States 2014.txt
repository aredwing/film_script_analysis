I haven't showered in a week... nor have I spoken to anyone. Even my ceiling fan stopped responding. Maybe I'm going insane. Slightly, but... The homes and hearts of you... South Indians are the same... completely hollow. How can I forget... I've replayed that day in my mind a thousand times. And what is this supposed to be? Sam bar. - This?! - Yes. Ls there a problem? Just one problem. You! If you have a problem, keep moving. Excuse me! You're cutting the line. How will he eat if he doesn't cut the line?! I've been the 'Head Cook' here for 10 years! Not a single 'complan' against my sambar! There hasn't been a single 'complan', that's why no improvement! Can anyone eat this?! No... But you'll get used to it in a while. The rasgulla's not bad. Try it. Give me the rasgulla. Finish your food first. Who do you think you are? Give it to me! One more. One rasgulla per student. Very good. What's edible, one per student... miserable sambar unlimited! Give her mine... Please. Please. Where did this stupid idiot come from? Teaching ME about sambar. Hi... I'm Krish. Ananya. Are you eating the mess food for the first time? Yes. And this sambar is awful. I'm very hungry. Let's go out and eat. Class is in an hour! So? Half a tandoori chicken, one roomali roti... Aren't you a South Indian? Tarn I I ian. And... Do you have beer? Gujarat is a dry state. Why? Gandhiji was born here. And... he was against beer? So... coming back to my question. What's the difference between South Indians and Tamilians? H uge difference. Thank you. For example, Tamil Brahmins don't eat non-vegetarian... I'm from a pure, Brahmin household. I can see that. And you? I'm a Punjabi. We can't digest our chicken without alcohol. I hope you're not from lll'. LlT Delhi. Why? Nothing! Why... ls that a problem? Not yet... Excuse me? Don't you think ll boys are a little weird? Meaning? I mean... In one week, I've received 10 proposals from llTians... for marriage! One even brought me his grandmother's bangle! And you think today will be your 11th? No... - That's not what I meant! - Then what did you mean? Forget it. Just because a few boys hit on you, you've lost your head? No, nothing like that. I'm sitting here, aren't I? Oh... wow! Thanks! I'm leaving. Here's my share... Bye. I'm sorry! Sorry! Look... I don't have any friends here... You're the only one who seemed safe. For once... someone wasn't hitting on me! You know what I mean, right? Wrong. I mean... Why wouldn't I hit on her? I'm a young, red-blooded Punjabi. So what if I'm average-looking? I was a man, after all. I mean... I am. Rs. 120 each. So... we're good, right? Settle down, everyone... Settle down! How many Economics graduates here? Yes... Ms. Swam I nathan. Do you recognize the curve? The basic marginal utility curve, sir. Yes! And how do you represent that curve mathematically? Um... Sir, the curve shows different bundles of goods... Tell me the mathematical formula. I don't know, sir. Notice, class... This is the state of Economics education in this country. A top graduate doesn't know the mathematical formula. You. The basic marginal utility of a particular consumer... can be mathematically... explained as MU= DUIDQ, where DU represents change in utility and DQ represents change in quantity... Ananya! Forget it! These things happen. Do you want to see how many medals I have? I stood third in my university! But now this Chatterjee is going to fail me! I'm sure all the professors will be laughing at me in the staffroom! Relax. In a couple of years you'll be earning four times their salary. And they'll be giving the same lecture to the next batch! Then you can smile. Okay? I've never been so insulted! Then don't raise your hand in class. If you want... I can help you with economics. I'm just asking; this isn't the 11th proposal. I was a topper in Eco... Sorry but you're an engineer. How can you help me? Correct. Bye. Krish! Okay, done. 8 0' clock? My room. And by the way... the score is now 22. Wow, you're taking this really seriously! Come. My mother. She's a singer! Tried to get me to sing, too... That's why I ran away and came here! What's your story? I don't have a story. Are you an orphan? No... Well then, what does your dad do? Shall we start? If you don't want to tell me, just say so. Dad... Retired Army Officer. And? Do you want to fail? Why are you so grumpy? Here. What does he have that I don't? Luck, bro. Luck! 2 minutes... Need to make a call. Kavita, phone! Kavi. Hello? Hello? Hello?! Hello? How many times have I told you? Stay by the phone after 10! It's 11! And anyway... Shipra told me cell phone vibrations cause hean attacks! How hard is it to say hello to him? You're too stubborn. So are you. Forget it. How are you? I'm fine... Have they started serving chicken there?! No! When we want non-veg, we go out and eat. I still don't understand... Why did you leave home and become vegetarian?! Listen! Have you made any friends there? Yes! Uh... Punjabi?! No! Well... never mind. You know how broad-minded we are! Of course. Okay, mom, I have a test tomorrow so... I'll hang up now. Okay, bye. You don't talk to your father? Why? Long story. So? So... not today. What do your parents expect? After graduation? I don't know. I just want to earn a lot of money. And then? Then... Then l... actually want to be a writer. Really? What will you write? Haven't thought about it... Simple things... Stories about people like us... I don't want to preach... I just want to write good, honest stories. Whether the story has a hero or not... the story should be the hero. I'm talking nonsense, right? Not really... And you? Mom thinks I can't do anything... but most likely a Marketing job. For now, I just need to get good grades. Ohhh... So that's why you made friends with me! Control yourself... You're not that much of a genius. Okay... - Goodnight. - Goodnight. Krish! Your theory... The "Honest Story", the "Hero" one... It's very good. I mean it! Bye. Maybe she was interested in me... Now... Instead of being happy, I panicked. I started behaving like an idiot. Krish! B Plus. Your shuns are rather short. What did you get? A minus. How?! I am a gold medalist in Economics! Do one thing.... Go show your medal to Professor Chatterjee. What's wrong with you? Nothing. What could be wrong? Okay, come on, let's go out. I owe you a treat! Dressed like that? Yes! Why? Are you feeling shy? Aren't you?! People are staring! These guys will stare no matter what I wear! So you want to excite people around here?! I don't want to excite anybody! You llTians are excited enough already! Looking at me obviously excites you more... but I really can't do anything about it. Krish!!! Are you serious?! You're really not coming with me? "My naive, simple heart was fine by itself" "And then you came along and turned it on its head" "l was falling in love with you" "But you said we're just friends" "Desire coursed through me" "But I could do nothing..." "I can't escape" "Love is snapping at my heels" "ls this a comedy?" "Or a tragedy?" "Never wanted it, now I'm stuck with it" "I'm confuzzled in love!" "I'm confuzzled in love!" "What an absurd state I'm in" "What is this mood God is in?" "Why does he gamble away my heart?" "This pretense of friendship feels like monotony" "And I play at it, even though my heart's not in it" "l was doing fine by myself" "Now like a dead flower, I wilt" "Used to be a dependable lad" "Now I'm as useful as a dried up pen" "l lie awake at night" "You've stolen my sleep" "And when I do sleep" "There you are peeping" "From the windows of my dreams" "So you tell me-what do I do?' "I can't escape" "Love is snapping at my heels" "ls this a comedy?" "Or a tragedy?" "Never wanted it, now I'm stuck with it" "I'm confuzzled in love!" I began to have nightmares... Ananya wanting to make me her brother. I thought that I should take care of things... before they get out of hand. We have to stop studying together! Huh? Suddenly?! What happened! It's not you, it's me! What does "It's not you, it's me" mean?! Please explain! Relax! We're not getting divorced! We just can't study together! Krish! "My naive, simple heart was fine by itself" "And then you came along and turned it on its head" Want to go to Rambhai's after class? No. I have to study. Are you both fighting? Mind your own business! "Never wanted it, now I'm stuck with it" "I'm confuzzled in love!" Krish sir! Can you spare 5 minutes, please? What is this childish behaviour, Krish? Do you think your grades will improve by ignoring me? Nothing like that. Krish! Eye contact! I can't do this! I can't keep up this farce of 'friendship'. Look, I know... You're way out of my league. But I don't want to be your llT brother, either! Okay, Krish, just calm down. No! I want you to be my girlfriend. Surly"- This is why we shouldn't hang out. But... Krish... I don't have any friends, besides you... Same here! This is torture for me, Ananya! Firstly, I hate Economics. Secondly, I'm in love with the mole on your left cheek. It follows me around and then I just want to kiss you! Forget it. You won't understand. For you... this is llT Proposal 55... Sorry! We were just looking for our Frisbee. There's nothing here! This boy only studies! Krish! You're thinking way ahead. Please stop! Not that ahead... Why should I stop? Behave yourself. You're getting nothing. Nothing else or... not even as much as yesterday? Do guys only think about one thing? Well... yes. We have to finish that Normal Curve chapter tonight! Which... curve? Tell me at least! Was this your first time? Yeah... with you. You mean you had a girlfriend before? Please take down these photos... It feels like your parents are watching us. You never mentioned this 'girlfriend' before... Long story... Oh God, Krish! You have too many 'long stories'! Rashmi. In college. Principal's daughter. Then what happened? Then what? I'm here. She's probably happily married... Did you love her? Sometimes I think that... If I was a little braver... Things would have been different today. Now, enough. Last question! Was she pretty? Not at all! - Punjabi? - No... You know... My parents are very conservative. It's not like we're getting married! Right. We're just messing around... Like... Friends with Benefits! Ananya... That's not what I meant! Surly"- I'm over-reacting... Sorry! Ananya! Ananya! - What? - I love you. What?! You don't believe me? Not at all. You're just scared I'll stop sleeping with you. Well... that too. No, but, honestly! We spend all our time together. Even when we're not together, I only think about you! It's clear, right? I love you! Good. Now, it sounds convincing. Hey wait! And you? What about me? I'm just using you for grades! Oh, really... Well, use me properly! "My heart is at odds with my head" "How did love sneak in and catch us unawares?" "A little bit of a rascal" "But kind of helpless, too" "Love's a devil" "But a lovable devil, it is" "Offo! Should I chase it away?" "Offo! Or should I hold it in embrace?" "Offo! Should I chase it away?" "Offo! Or should I hold it in embrace?" "Should I wield it like I'm proud?" "Or slap it away? Offo!" "Look here it is... with pocketfuls of mischief" "Just like you, it's quirky too" "It's impulsive, but it's thoughtful too" "A little decent and a little shameless too" "Offo! Should I chase it away?" "Offo! Or should I hold it in embrace?" "Offo! Should I chase it away?" "Offo! Or should I hold it in embrace?" "Should I wield it like I'm proud?" "Or slap it away? Offo!" "Crossed every line of astonishment" "Acting silly when I'm in my senses, too" "What started as a joke is now an obsession" "A rather expensive obsession, too" "Love caresses my shoulders like it's just a friend" "But grabs every chance to show what it really is" "Past every limit is this gesture of love" "Love's a devil" "But a lovable devil, it is" "Offo! Should I chase it away?" "Offo! Or should I hold it in embrace?" "Offo! Should I chase it away?" "Offo! Or should I hold it in embrace?" "Should I wield it like I'm proud?" "Or slap it away? Offo!" "Offo!" "Offo!" "Offo!" I just hope to make some good money... And then writing? I don't know what I'll write, though... Write your tragic love story with Rashmi! Not cool, Ananya... We agreed not to talk about it. I'm serious! Tragedy's the new cool! The critics will be happy! Krish... Hmm. I love you. What's gotten into you? Nothing... I've been thinking about it... so I said it. Krish... are you asleep? No... say. Placements start in 10 days... Superb, isn't it? You'll get a great job. Forget the job, Krish... In 4 weeks we'll be in different cities. So what? I'll just find a job wherever you are. That's not in our control, Krish! Why are you worried? We'll see where fate takes us... No! The issue is, where do YOU want... to take this relationship? Let's not have this conversation now. Please, come. If not now, then when, Krish? Ananya... I'm not saying no... I just need some time. Weren't 2 years enough, Krish? This is what's great about you guys. It takes you no time tojump into bed... but when it comes to commitment, you need time to think! Ananya! Final question... Why do you want to work with our bank? Because, Sir... Your bank is the best. Mr. Malhotra, we want a candidate with a 7-point grade... which you don't have. Nevertheless... give us 5 minutes? I felt suffocated. I couldn't answer the girl I had loved for two years... And I was waiting for an answer for a job I didn't care about. What was I doing?! And more so, sir... Sunsilk depicts the modern, confident woman, who no matter what- Yes? Sorry, sir. I have something important to discuss with her. Her interview is on... Can't you wait? No, sir. Sorry. I only need a minute. Hows the interview going? Krish Malhotra, this better be important! Ananya Swaminathan... I've never loved anyone like this before. I want to marry you. MarTY me? Please? Is everything Okay? Yes, sir... Now what? Now.. say yes? Yes! Now go... or I won't get the job. Okay! All the best! Sorry, sir... So, as I was saying... Sunsilk... And the confident woman... Girl... Why are you wearing slippers?! Forget the slippers... Why did you bring so many sweets? Shipra, Guddo, Rajji... everyone wanted to come! You're the one who told them not to. They've all sent boxfuls of love to you! And why have you become so thin? Mom... Come on. Let's go. This was bound to happen... Who can survive only on vegetarian food?! - Vastrapur road, please. - Hold this. Mom... I want you to meet someone. Who? A girl. A Girl? Are you in relationship?! No, mom... She's just a very good friend. Friends are always very good. If they were bad, they wouldn't be our friends. Her name is Ananya... She's got a great marketing job with Sunsilk! Really! Sunsilk shampoo! Can she send us half a dozen cartons? Mom, please don't talk like a middle class woman. You will embarrass me. Stop the rickshaw! Turn it around! Turn! I was foolishly excited to come for your conversation! Slogged like a donkey to find all these sweets for you! Why did I come if all I do is embarrass you in front of your friends?! Girls only cause fights at home. See? He's absolutely right! You please just drive ahead. Mom... Listen to me... That's not what I meant... I've told Ananya so many stories about you, she's dying to meet you! By the way, Krish... Did you tell her everything about us? No... Just how hard you've worked to raise me. And how beautiful you are... Leave the butter for your food! Listen, sir! What do Gujaratis eat for dessert? Sweet Lentils? Mom... Ananya. Hello, Aunty! Hello... Krish is always talking about you! Really? Since I arrived, he's been talking only about you. Shall we sit, Mom? Here? Ananya... Where's Aunty? She's on her way... You know how long she takes to wear her sari! Oh, yes... Since when do you know so much about saris? Oh! Oh God! They're Madrasis! Tarn I I ian. Same thing. Okay, mom. Come quickly! Mum... Dad... This is Krish. And his mom. [Man] u. I'm so happy we're all together. Where's Krish's father? He has a heart problem. He can't travel. Oh. Okay. I'll see you. What kind of father misses his own son's convocation? Let it go, Radha. - They let Madrasis study here? - Mom! I have to go join the line. Please talk to them. In which language? I don't speak Madrasi. We are all going for lunch together tomorrow You can go if you want to. I'll eat alone. So... Aunty... How does it feel? Are you excited? Yes... but this is what we expected from Ananya! Oh. good. Uncle... How long are you staying? Two days. Why? I was thinking... we could hire a car and go sight seeing tomorrow? No. We can go see Gandhi Ashram? Yes! Very good idea, Aunty! Gandhi Ashram! Done! Okay, Mom? Gandhi Ashram! What's there in Gandhi Ashram?! I don't want to go. Typical Punjabi. All money, no class. Uncultured people. Uncultured and us?! These Madrasis are the uncultured ones! What?! What did you say? Nothing, Aunty! Mom, please, control! Control? These Madrasis should control their daughters! Look at all the Madrasi heroines... each one has trapped a Punjabi boy! Control! Why should I control? Come on, let's go! Come on!!! What happened? I'm telling the truth! Krish! Let's go! Thank Goodness you didn't touch their feet instead! Krish! Love you! That day, I watched my mother graduate. She was so happy... She forgot all her problems... But by then, Ananya's parents had a problem. What are you staring at that for? Just write Delhi. There's no need to go anywhere else. I had a few days off before the job started... so I went home. Things were tense... Neither mom nor Ananya's family had forgotten the fight. Hi! Phone sex? What?! Today's my first day at Sunsilk! It's a great office... I'm very excited! You're applying to Chennai... right? Mom wants me to stay in Delhi... You know I'd come there if I had an option... Please come! I miss you! I'll figure it out. Good. I love you. Hmm. No. You have to say it. Mom's watching... Hard luck. Say it. I... love... you... Zing! This new app. I'll message you the name. Download it. Very bad, Krish! Please think of something better next time! Okay. Bye. Ananya! What did he say? Nothing. Beware of that Madrasan. They're experts at brainwashing boys! Mom, her name is Ananya. And I love her. She's making a fool of you! She's successful, has a good job. Why would she fool me? Look. We Punjabis are... fair and good looking. And these Madrasis... Dark. They're jealous of us! Have you seen Ananya? She's fairer than me! These fair skinned Madrasans are even more dangerous! What nonsense! Sorry, Mom! Sorry! Today, it's just my finger... it's going to be my throat tomorrow! Okay, Mom... relax. I'll apply to Delhi. - Promise? - Promise. Happy? Now, where are the band-aids? There. Writer?! So, you're going to wander around in your khadi kurta, with a ratty bag? It's that Madrasan's doing. She's going to ruin your life! Tell him! He shouldn't repeat your mistakes! What did you gain from this love marriage? Besides fighting? We'll find a nice, educated girl for Krish... Right? I already found a nice, educated girl, Mom. But she's a Madrasan! - So? - So?! What if tomorrow you want to marry an Assamese or Oriya girl? Unacceptable! Great. He's here. Hello, brother-in-law. I said hello, brother-in-law. What are you doing here? What do you mean? My sister invited me. Great. One wretch has come to cry over the wretchedness of another. I haven't come her to be humiliated! I don't know how you stand it! This is the limit. Look, son. You should meet Dolly... She's a nice girl for you. Look at them. Even the greatest love fades over time. Okay. Be well. Take care. Who's Dolly? Who is Dolly? - ls he looking for girls? - Yes. Why wasn't I told? What is it to you? Don't feign interest in our lives. We're not used to it. You and your family have corrupted his mind! Not to her, speak to me! Don't even think about it. Krish, go inside. Krish, go! First tell him to leave. Krish, go to your room! Mind the glass... Just go, Krish! Every time you reconcile, he acts out again. Just let the glass be! It'll cut his feet, and he'll learn a lesson. But what if you cut your foot? Why don't you just leave him? It's not that simple, Krish... Anyway... - He only comes here to sleep. What difference does it make? Wasn't he going to open a security firm? What happened? He punched the only willing financer. I'm used to him, Krish. But I'm scared of your temper now. Once your job is fixed, stay at the company's accommodation. I'll handle things here. Then why should I stay in Delhi? - Meaning? - I mean... I'll earn well, Mom, let's get out of here! I'm not going to leave Delhi. At least, my relatives are here. Mom... Mom, I want to go to Chennai. I'm calling Rajji at once... Only a priest can save my son from that witch now. - Patti-nakka-pakkam? - Pa?inamwkkam. Yeah! Next to Annai Velankanni church? Yes yes! Sorry, I couldn't pick you up. I'm in Vizag for 2 days. By the way... Welcome to my city, Mr. Malhotra! Thanks for coming. I've missed you. Very much. You'll see half of Chennai on your way to your apartment. No one here knows Hindi, so don't even try. Use actions. It's the least you can do for the love of your life! "l found love in you" "And I ran to your city" "l long to see you" "My heart says your name" "l have come to be one with you" "l long to see you" "My heart says your name" My office is not too far from your apartment... if you know what I mean. "l found love in you" "And I ran to your city" Shobha Aunty from Texas is here. Dinner at my place day after. Or we won't get to meet. Can't wait to see you! Oh, and mom's having trouble finding a music teacher... so she's a little upset these days. Also, please don't be late. You have to impress the in-laws! Love you. Hello, sir. Krish. Ananya's friend...? Come... come... Take off your shoes! Be careful of the rangoli! Their house was so quiet... Like we were at a funeral! Ananya's parents don't believe in furniture. Their living room looked like... a Punjabi home that was robbed. The robbers didn't like the sofa, so they left it behind. Sir... your house is lovely. What lovely? No running water. Only 3 hours in the morning... Unreliable electricity... Bloody flies everywhere. Hello, sir! That's Radha's music teacher. Radha's busy cooking for you in the kitchen! What to do... Wate r? No! It's okay... Yeah... Actually... Yes or no? Yes... Yes... If it's not a problem... Now that you've reached our home... Why should water be a problem? Rad ha! VVate r! Yes, coming! Hello, aunty. Hello. Thank you. Sorry forjust showing up like this... This Ananya, I tell you... Never asks before inviting people over! Please sit. Yes... I simply can't understand... why would your bank post a North Indian in Chennai? Why?! Bloody, stupid bank. Uncle, is Ananya home? The look on his face! Like I was hitting on his wife. What a strange house... then, suddenly I began to hear sounds. Ah... Carnatic music! Beautiful, sir... sorry, guys! - Hi, Ananya. - Hi. Hi, dad! Oh, Amma's practicing! Sorry! Mom won the Tamil Sangam Singing Championship... two years in a row when Dad was posted in Kolkata! Oh... Sir, you must have seen a lot of India! I was not on vacation! I was working, every single day... Uh... You're right. I got to see a lot of India in the last 15 years because of the job... But in the end, I got stuck in Chennai. Stuck, sir? Isn't Chennai your hometown? Ananya... Dinner. - Don't even think about it. - No one's around! Mom and Dad are right there! By the way, you look very nice in sari... Thanks. You look okay, too. You're stuck at this beginner's level! Howll you ever make any progress? You find someone else... I can't do this. Come! Dad... He's come half way across the country. Please be nice. For me. Okay? Thank you, Dad... No... That's the plate. I asked Pattama to find a nice Brahmin boy for Ananya... But her own daughter ran away with a foreigner! Listen to this. Same story in every house! Could you speak in Hindi? I don't understand Tamil... Learn Tamil, then. Anyway, it doesn't concern you. - Krish! - Yes? Let's elope? Come on! Okay, let's run away! Can you? I can't betray them... I want my parents to be the happiest when I get married! I know it's hard but we have to win them over. Do you really want to elope? No. I can't leave mom alone with dad forever. Anyway... There's no honour in running away. If we weren't in Mylapore... I'd have kissed you. - Pattinapakkam? - Rs. 200. Okay, go. Krish, I have an idea... by which you can come to my house anytime. What? LlT tuitions for my brother. No, Ananya. No. No. Please! Not for free! Tomorrow onwards 6 o' clock. What 6 o'clock?! I work till 7 pm! - Evening is for us to hang out! - Exactly. - No, Ananya! - Bye! I love you! 6 am tomorrow! "When the flame of love re-ignites everyday" "Its smoke will rise..." "How can it be concealed?" My dear, you are not perfecting anything! Find someone else to teach you!

Ls Mom okay or did something happen? Your mother is fine. She's at home. Then why did you call? What do you mean? To find out if you're okay. Even if I'm not, what is it to you? How shameless you are! I called to ask how you are... and you're being rude! What have I done to deserve this, Krish? Krish? Hello! "Speaks only your name" Thank you, sir. For dropping me. So, hows work? Okay. Nothing new? Same bank, same job. What could be new? You know how to make these reports? Yes! Why? The new GM... Asked us to do Plug Point presentations. Power Point, sir. Power Point! Fool! You idiot! Rascal! Sorry, sir. Not you, the auto driver is an idiot! Scoundrel! Sir, if you want... I can help you with the presentation... No, thank you. You can walk from here. Krish! Yes, sir? You're Ananya's friend... You tutor my son... Thanks a lot. But you can't marry Ananya. But sir... No! We are simple people. Don't tarnish our name in the community. - Sir, just- - Please. We'll keep trying for a few weeks, but if your parents don't agree... Then what, Krish? We'll try something else. Your company's promotional event is this week, right? S.P. Balasubramaniam and Shankar Mahadevan are performing. They couldn't find a third singer. Can we come? Of course! I got passes for you all. Great! I'm sure mom will be happy... ls he that fellow everyone is talking about? Shut up! I'll tell you later... He's Manj u's teacher. [Man] u! Manj u! Teacher! Listen... Something special going on today? That's Harish from San Fransisco. Harish who? Ananya and his stars have matched... And special food for special guest. I m very comfortable. You start. I'll be back. Congratulations! Your groom is waiting for you with his goggles. - Krish, I'm sorry... - That's great. Do what you like and then apologise. Next time it'll be a wedding card with an apology. Right? Listen! This is only for Shobha Aunty! Then why are you wearing such a nice sari? Thanks. It's mom's. Krish, I love you. Breathe. Let's run away. Can't run in this sari. She studied at llM Ahmedabad... and now she's working in sales at Sunsilk. He asked if I'm a virgin! Virgin?! I said only till I turned 18! The way he ran... Good! Otherwise I would have to beat him up. Your folks hate me... and now you're leaving. - What am I going to do? - Help dad with his presentation! You'll become friends. I offered. - He threw me out of the car. - This time he won't. I'm leaving and Manju can't do it. Who else will help him? Sir! Ananya was saying... your presentation isn't ready... I can help you, if you like... Why are you being so helpful? No... ifsjust... Work is a little light these days... So, I'm free in the evenings... And I don't know anyone here, besides you'll. I miss my family... Krish. If you're free tomorrow evening... come home. Thank you, Uncle! I mean... Okay, sir. I can't help you. But, Master, if I practice... Krish Malhotra. I know it's meaningless to talk to you... But I thought I'd try one last time. One day when your children disrespect you... You'll understand what I went through for all these years I heard you were at my house till pretty late last night... Manju in the morning, Daddy in the evening... You should just hire me... I'll buy the groceries also! Come soon... I heard your mother and her useless sisters talking... why you went to Chennai... It's better if we find you a girl... Sir, you already have two established singers... I think you should have one new singer. Have you heard her sing? Yes, sir. She's very good! No... I can't do it. I've never sung such songs! Aunty, you'll be prepared if you watch the songs on TV! But... why me? It's a YES Bank event... They need a new singer. And who's better than you? Sometimes we make impulsive decisions... that fill our whole lives with regret. This girl may be the biggest mistake of your life. U nfonunately, your father. Done, sir. Oh... Good. So, sir... all set for your first presentation? I had to prepare the report... Verma will present it. Why, sir? Will you have another drink? Radha's not home today. No, sir, I should leave. Won't be able to get rickshaws later. Oh just relax. Relax. Sleep here. No, Sir. I'll leave... Relax. One minute... One minute. Wear this to sleep in. Very comfortable. No, sir... Thank you, sir. What are you future plans? Manager at YES Bank? Actually, sir... I want to be a writer. Very good! Working for yourself... Very good! Otherwise... you'll be preparing all your life for others' presentations... Very good... You've really got me in a fix! Aunty, don't worry! You're going to be a star. - Just practice. - No... I can't do it! Aunty, you'll be very good! I promise. Just don't tell anyone. - Hi, Krish. - Hello, Uncle. Hi. Sorry, Krish. Mom couldn't come. She needed to urgently go to her friend's house. - Very sorry. - It's okay. Uncle, can I get you a drink? I don't drink! "The waves of music are rising" "Desire is lingering in my mind" "My heart yearns to see you my dear!" I was mesmerised by your words" "l hesitated to come close to you" "l longed for you to come near and embrace me!" "You made a place in my heart" "You stole my mind." "You gave me boundless joy, oh my life!" "Oh my dear, what have you done?" "Oh my love, what have you done?" "Don't you know I've been waiting for you?" "Don't love me so..." "Don't love me so..." "Oh, howl love you" I was mesmerised by your words" "l hesitated to come close to you" "l longed for you to come near and embrace me!" "My heart yearns to hear it time and again!" "Say it's love..." "Say it's love..." "Yes, I love you!" "Oh yes, I love you!" And then Verma said... "How did you do it?!" And I said, "What? I know PowerPoint!" - Aunty, any singing offers? - No, no! But I'm going to start Contemporary singing classes now... Uncle... Aunty... Manj u. I have something to say. I came to Chennai 6 months ago... But I've been in love with Ananya for 3 years. And she loves me too... I think. We thought love is enough to get married... so we introduced you all at the convocation. But that's when we realized... the journey from love to marriage... isn't easy. We could have easily eloped... But Ananya wanted you all at her wedding... And happy- Happier than her! I know... I'm no Harish. But please, don't hate me. For our happiness... accept me. Please. I, Krish Malhotra... hereby ask you all to marry me. Nice. Will you keep my daughter happy? Very happy- Our cultures and backgrounds are very different. Horn! Will your parents accept my daughter? I'll try my best. I promise. Krish is coming at the perfect time! All those pretty girls at Minty's wedding... he'll forget the Madrasan! Basically, I just have to agree with everything your mom says. Yes! Plus it's a good time to visit. My cousin Minty is getting married. Minty! You just need to win over Mom and her family. Dad won't agree... but he's a lost cause. Ls the flight on time? I'm glad this Chennai nonsense is over. Few days being fed at home... and everything will be okay! Focus, Ananya. There's nothing scarier than a Punjabi mother-in-law. Can't wait. Sorry... for leaving... suddenly... Have you gained some weight in last four years? Sorry! I still don't have any friends. Anyway... - This is my new problem. 10 publishers have rejected it already. I'm meeting the 11th tomorrow... to be rejected again. Maybe it was a stupid mistake to leave the bank... But I'm no stranger to stupid mistakes... Oh! There he is! The whole family is here. Let go of my hand. He brought this trouble here?! Sister, she's not pregnant, is she? I'll kill that Madrasan, if she is! How are you? How was the flight? Have you eaten? Mom! Ananya. Oh. I'm so happy to see you! Hello, Aunty! Ananya's here for a week! - Oh, where will you stay? - Company's guesthouse! Oh, do drop by some time. - Come on, take your stuff! - Mom! Ananya's accommodation is from Monday. She'll stay at home for the weekend. Whose home? Ours? Come! Come, get your stuff! Isn't Rajji's son-in-law handsome! And such good values! Always touches his elders' feet... What's his name? Duke. - What?! - Duke! What do you mean, Duke? He's from London! So his pet name is Duke. How much are they spending on the wedding? 25 lakhs! 4 lakhs just on imported liquor! Plus a car for the boy. Don't tell anyone. It's a surprise. Anyway, a boy like that is a dime to a dozen! That's true. When I asked if Duke is worth so much... how much will Krish get at his wedding?! You know what Rajji said... At least a wedding of Rs. 40 lakhs and gifts worth Rs. 10 lakhs! Well, good! At least we know my market value now. Aunty... You could've sent the driver alone. You didn't have to trouble yourself. It's no problem, son. It's not like you came alone, either. Didn't you tell your mom that I was coming? I wanted to surprise her! There's a big difference between surprise and shock! True. Anyway, she's out. - Can we... - No chance! Why are you being aggressive, dude? Just listen to me! Ananya, relax. Morn just talks... but she's good at heart. VVell, Hitler was probably 'good at heart' too. You want to take the next flight back? Okay. Sorry. What do I do?! Cook! You Punjabis are always hungry. No! I mean... Just help mom with dinner tonight! No, better idea! Tell her you'll make dinner tonight! She'll be so impressed! Are you mad? I don't know how to cook! What?! What? Do you know how to cook? But I'm a guy... And women belong in the kitchen, right? - Right. - Krish! Sorry. I can't do it. Remember what you said? You'll do your best. Yes, I remember, but - Aunty... can I help? No. Ananya's a really good cook, Mom! Really? Here. I was thinking we should have chicken and parathas. Maybe some dal... and raita! Oh, I almost forgot... - Make some rice, too. - Mom... mom! If you both cook together you'll get done so much quicker! What's the hurry, son? Take your time. Anyway, I'm tired of eating my own cooking. Okay, look. The flour is under the stove. The lentils and spice powders are in that cabinet. - Anything else? - Um... Dessert? No... not today. I'm going to my room... Call me when the food is ready. Okay. - Can I help? - No. Did you get hurt? I said I would try my best. So what if I have to shed some blood for it? - Young or old... All women are born melodramatic. What is that?! I don't know. - Don't know? It's burnt! - What's happening here? Ls this any way to cook?! - And what are you doing here? - Nothing! I can see that. Wait till you're married, she'll make you her puppet! She doesn't even know how to make chapatis! I don't know anything, Aunty! Except how to trap innocent young boys. Horn! Ananya... Anan... Mom, she's trying! Just give her a chance! Why should I? What is she to me? I love her. She's really got you bad. First, you wasted my mango juice on her... now you're fighting with me! What are you saying, Mom?! She'll hear you! Then let her hear! I'm not afraid of anyone! I want to go to the guesthouse. Ananya, if you act like this, we don't stand a chance. She hates me, Krish. Relax. You know she doesn't hate you. Just give it sometime. Everything will be okay. Mom... When is Minty's wedding? Next Friday to Sunday. - You're coming, right? - Yes. Ananya will come too. What am I supposed to say to who she is? My fiance. Mom, please! Let me speak. What's the point? If you've made up your mind, go get married. Go right now! I'm sure some temple will still be open. - Mom, just - - Aunty, please? We want you to happily agree. We don't want to force you. But you are forcing me! I worked hard to raise him. I have some expectations, too. I want my in-laws to respect me. My family and I will find a very nice girl for Krish. Why do you think they won't like her?! - Because she's not Punjabi? - Just let Ananya meet them once! Look, Krish. I've been taunted my whole life because of your father. I can't take any more because of you. Nothing like that will happen. I promise. Aunty, I'm sorry... for just showing up like this. It's not your fault. Krish is the one who never tells me anything. Yes, Aunty. His communication skills are a little weak... Not a little... They're very weak. Where's Uncle? I don't know. I'll know if he bothers to return. Good morning, Uncle. I'm Ananya. Krish's friend. Hurry up or we'll get stuck in traffic. Where are you going? I'll get the bag. Tell your shameless son to show some respect or I'll... - What happened? - What do you mean what happened?! Who's this girl?! - She's his friend. - This is normal for this house. - His friend?! - Sorry... - What is she doing in our house?! It's not your fault. Let's go. - He's going to drop her to guesthouse now. I didn't know she was coming. I was going to tell you in the morning... Morning?! When will your morning begin? Please, Vikram... It's too early to fight... Why were we doing this? Pretending to be a normal family? I missed Chennai... Why had I brought Ananya here? I was misleading the poor girl. Why didn't she just leave me? Dad... I wanted to talk to you... There's this girl... Rashmi. My professor's daughter... ls this what you do in college? Dad, please... Hear me out. Say. They're getting her married to someone else. Oh, so they're against it, too. Good. They have a problem with me... What problem? Bunking... Discipline... Etc. Does your mother know about this? Kavita. Kavita! Did you know about this? - Yes, I was going to tell you... - Tell me when? - Dad- - You be quiet. - When were you going to tell me? - Dad it's not Mom's fault, please just talk to the professor once... Why should I talk to the professor? I'm not going to support this nonsense. I love her. Forget about it. Concentrate on your MBA. Girls will come and go. These are just distractions. But you didn't have any distractions, Dad. Let it go, Krish. What did you say? Yet you were thrown out of the army. Why? What are you doing, Vikram? This is what he deserves. He's shameless. Won't learn any other way. Good for nothing. You know how he is when he drinks. Are you okay? Kavita! You're the one who's spoiled him! - Just listen! - Listen to what?! Sometimes he wants to be a writer, sometimes he's in love! He's a kid! He needs our support. I will not support this rubbish! He's wasting his time and my money! You could have heard him out! Like you can do anything but drink! Then why don't you just leave! Marrying you was the biggest mistake of my life. It was your mistake... and it's my life that's ruined. Get out of here. Krish, please go. I said get out of here! Can't you hear what- You're so fair! How can you be a Madrasan? Tarn I I ian. Same thing! Oh, Kavita! Your daughter-in-law? I must say she's quite fair by South Indian standards! Rajji, come meet our Krish's lover! Anyay! Anyay? Like... illegal?! "This Punjabi boy from Jalandhar" "Maidens falling for every glance" "Chilling in the fields" "Living life King size" "It's my way or the highway" "Who does it make a difference to?" "What, why? Who is who? Only to whiskey friends are true!" "And some chicken with it only makes things better!" "Where the pretty girls are" "That's where you'll find the Jatt boys" "Even better if the girls are up for it too" "Punjabi girl, not so easily charmed" "She'll make you dance on her every tune!" "Boys fall by the dozen" "for every sway of their hips!" "Dinky on the left" "Pinky on the right" "Like a fashion parade of pretty girls!" "What, why? Who is who? Only to whiskey friends are true!" "And some chicken with it only makes things better!" "Where the pretty girls are" "That's where you'll find the Jatt boys" "Even better if the girls are up for it too" "Don't boast your broken Punjabi to me" "Tell me how much your promises really mean?" "Tell me how much your promises really mean?" "The word of a Jatt boy is legally binding" "He'll sign his life over to you!" "Chilling in the fields" "Living life King size" "It's my way or the highway" "Who does it make a difference to?" "What, why? Who is who? Only to whiskey friends are true!" "And some chicken with it only makes things better!" "Where the pretty girls are" "That's where you'll find the Jatt boys" "Even better if the girls are up for it too" "And some chicken with it only makes things better!" "Even better if the girls are up for it too" Why is that chubby uncle so angry? He must be hungry. Everyone's really serious! Somethings up. Let's find out. Horn! What's happening? It's too small. Duke's tunic? It's not funny! The car Rajji gave Duke is too small. Oh! And their family won't fit in it. No! They saw the key and thought it was a big car! Oh! They were confused by the big key! I don't believe this! Now? They want a big car or no wedding. But Aunty, a gift is a gift. Not gift... Dowry. Anyway, what's the solution? Well, Rajji doesn't have the money. So, we've decided to give them our jewelry as a guarantee. You wait, I'll be back. Dowry. Really? Ananya... Ananya! Excuse me? May I say something? What? Before you give away your jewelry, can I talk to Duke? No, no. You don't get involved in this. Please, let me try. I promise there'll be no problem. Duke... Hi. Hi! What's your salary? What?! - How much do you earn per month? - What?! 25 thousand. Who are you? Doesn't matter. I earn 50. Can you tell me why you deserve such grand wedding? And you're getting a car for dowry! I'm the boy! Really? So? So! So... Look at Minty carefully. You think you had a shot with her without an arranged marriage? - This is the limit! - Oh no, I'm not done. Do you know what they've been through for this wedding? They' re in debt. And this car? It costs as much as 15 years of your holiday bonuses! And the car you want, you won't be able to afford even after retirement. If you twist their arm, they'll give you the bigger car... but don't you have any self-respect?! Look, you can get the big car. Now you decide; do you want to get married honourably... or let go of a girl like Minty because of a car? Ananya... let it go. Two minutes, Uncle. You have two minutes to decide. - I want to go to my Mummy. - Why? Why are you so dominating?! Please, let me to go to my Mummy. Okay. We'll all go. Come on then! Mummy! I like this car. But, the deal was for big car! Can't I buy a big car on my own? Don't I have any self-respect? Stop this silly fighting. What's the decision? Sorry, madam. Done. Okay? I want to get married! So Duke's parents relented and... Ananya became a hero to my family. Thank you. Here. Rajji and Shipra loved her. So... yes? Yes... - But what about her folks? - They've agreed. Look, Ananya. Both families need to have an understanding. You remember the convocation? Your mom's right. Meaning? I mean our parents have agreed, but they still don't like each other. So what? It's not like they're getting married. If we've decided to make them happy, let's do it right? They have to meet again. No, now enough, okay? I can't play this game forever. What more can I do? Get Mom to Chennai? No! Let's go on vacation? All of us! That way they'll get to know each other. Please? In this world, what's the most important reason to get married? Love! In India, however, there are a few more steps... The girl's family has to love the boy. The boy's family has to love the girl. The boy's family has to love the girl's family... and the girl's family has to love the boy's family. After all this... if the boy and girl still love each other, then they get married. What's bugging them? Look how they're standing there looking surly. Nothing like that! What do you know of the politics of marriage? Thank you. By the way, Krish... This hotel must be very expensive. Yes, but I've promised to hold the next YES Bank conference here. So, they've given me a discount. Come now, smile, please? Smile. Namaste, Kavita. - Namaste. - Hello, Aunty. Hello. Oh! This is for you. Silk sari. Tussar silk. Specially for you from Assam Emporium. Thank you. Our silk saris are also very famous. - Of course! - Kanjeevaram saris. Your husband couldn't come? He's not keeping well. The doctors have asked him not to travel by air. Isn't there a train from Delhi? We don't travel by train. Their toilets are awfully small. Shall we go, mom? You know we Punjabis are really large-hearted. We never greet our in-laws empty handed. Especially, the boy's mother! It's considered bad luck... Shall we go sightseeing tomorrow? Coffee Shop at 11 am? Sightseeing! With her? - Mom. - No. Dad, please! Done! Sightseeing! Oh, the hotel has upgraded us. Please, take the bigger room. There are more of you. What about us! - Let's go. - No, no Aunty! How shameless! Who?! Him? No. Them. Who makes the groom pick up luggage?! - I'm not the "groom". - What then, the bride?! Don't talk rubbish! What was the need to give them the big room? There's more of them? Sure, sure. Those poor guys mustn't have ever seen such a grand hotel. You know what their biggest mistake was? They met the boy's mother empty-handed! And that Madrasan called ME uncultured at that conversation. Why did I have to get carried away and buy her a silk sari? Rs. 2,000 down the drain. How pretty the sea is! Yes, but Chennai's sea is cleaner and prettier than this! Hanging Gardens! What a nice view! What?! People are hanged here?! It's called Hanging Gardens because it's on a hill! Oh... you scared me... Your mom is so rude! Your family's not exactly friendly, either. What do we do? I have an idea. But you can't feel bad. Depends. First, you'll need to get my mother a really nice present. - Okay... - Next. Whenever we're eating out, insist on paying. Snatch her purse if you have to! Punjabis consider this affection. And? Third, right now, in the middle of this beach, you and I should... Absolutely not! Not until the wedding. I'm very stressed! But it's a great stress buster! Control yourself, Krish! You know what the worst part of getting married is? First, you have to discuss clothes and jewelry. Second, all women lose their tempers at the same time! I mean... So many demands already... God knows what will happen in the future! This is for you. Oh, you shouldn't have! This too. Please come! Sit! Have some chicken! It's delicious! We're vegetarians... Oh. Well... no problem. Who would have thought... One day the kids would be introducing their parents! It came as a shock to us, too... But once we met Krish, we were okay. Oh, don't pull my leg! You must have thanked your stars... that your daughter found such a handsome and qualified boy! Actually, 90 percent of Tamilians are highly qualified. All of Ananya's uncles are engineers in the USA. I'm sorry but 90% Tamilians aren't fair-skinned either! Mom! Mom, let's have dessert Oh by the way... Krish's uncles are also very rich and successful! Ananya met them at our place! What a magnificent wedding it was! My brother gave his son-in-law a car as a wedding present! How lucky you are... to have landed such a wonderful boy! Luck by chance! Mom, what are you saying! We haven't conned your son into this. He came to our house everyday, we couldn't say no. - Mom... - It's true! We're making a big effort for you, too. Everyone knows Krish's father is against this marriage. We're still here, aren't we? Well, you're not doing me any favours. Millionaire Punjabi girls are lining up for my Krish. There's no need to yell. We are educated people. - Oh and we're illiterate?! - Mom... He said we. All of us are educated! Shut up! You're blind to everything! Go... live in Chennai with your in-laws! Krish. This is not right. - Let it go, mom. - You be quiet! This won't work out. She won't keep our child happy. Look at the things she says! What are they muttering in their code language? How would I know'?! I thought they'd have taught you by now! This is not okay, let us get going. This is way too much. Come. - Dad, please... - That's it! We're leaving! Aunty we did whatever Krish asked. But nothing is enough for you. Ananya, we'll talk to them... It's not like that. Thanks for lunch. So, you told them to buy these saris for me. Yes. What's the point of doing all this?! Of course. It's always my fault! People are right. Falling in love changes the best of men. That's not true! Did you see how rude your dear Ananya was to me? I know she's a little brazen, but you were wrong this time, Mom. You're going to treat me as a servant? My life is doomed. No one is making you a servant, mom! Daughters-in-law can't be so rude! Just think. What if Minty speaks in this way to Duke's mother?! We rule our daughters-in-law with iron fists! Okay. You can do it too. How! You always take her side. I won't! Once we're married, you show her who's the boss! You know how passive her parents are. They can't do anything. Please just handle the situation for now. Please? Fine. Ananya. - We were just talking about you- - I heard. I wanted to make one last attempt to fix things. But not anymore. Ananya, Ananya! Just listen to me! Ananya, please listen to me! I was trying to pacify Mom! You're telling me the same lies you told her! The problem's not just your mother. It's you, too. We're done, Krish. Are you insane? For such a minor thing... Minor thing?! My parents can't take any more humiliation! - They've done a lot for me! - I can fix this, Ananya. By lying to your mother. Right? How many people will you lie to? All your lies will destroy us one day! Everything will be okay. We've made a huge mistake... You know, Krish, it's not about the communities... it's about the kind of people we want to spend our lives with. Certain things are just not in our destiny... Like this. "Without you... there's no fire in the sun" "No song in the songbird" "if the moon reigns with such abandon" "Why is there only darkness in my grasp?" "Without you... there's no spring in the springtime" "No waking in wakeness" "Without you, my love," "My heart is a deserted island" These incomy?ete stories... And these incomwete goodbyes "Will they remain incomplete..." forever?" These incomy?ete stories... And these incomwete goodbyes "if the moon reigns with such abandon" "Why is there only darkness in my grasp?" I've made fresh, hot parathas... Please eat? So... you've stopped talking to your mother as well? What wrong could she have done? I'm tired, Dad. Forgive me. I can't fight anymore. "Such anger..." "Let me tell you a secret" "This body is an empty shell" "Its spirit... its soul... is you." So as I was saying... She's an optimist, she has her dreams... but she's not afraid to write her own life story. "Without you, my love," "My heart is a deserted island" Why are you here, Krish? To say sorry. It's not your fault. But I'm the one suffering. You look terrible... You know your mom will never accept my family. Let's run away? Isn't it enough that we love each other? It's never enough... Ananya, you're killing me. You think it's not hard for me? If it's hard, then why are you doing this? So that we both stop hurting each other. I love you, Ananya. Please leave, Krish. Listen. Please, stop calling me. Otherwise... Otherwise, I'll have to block your number. "Without you... there's no fire in the sun" "No song in the songbird" "if the moon reigns with such abandon" "Why is there only darkness in my grasp?" These incomy?ete stories... "And incomplete goodbyes" "Will they remain incomplete..." forever?" These incomy?ete stories... "And incomplete goodbyes" "Will they remain incomplete..." forever?" "Without you, my love," "The days feel like rivers, islanded by the nights..." I need some help. I... I want to kill myself. Suicide. Actually, I had come to you for sleeping pills... My folks don't believe in counselling. Punjabis thinks only crazy people go to psychiatrists. You came home pretty late last night... ls everything Okay? My pension papers are held up. I need a letter typed... On the laptop... I'll do it. Thank you. Hows your friend? Which friend? The one from Chennai... who was at Minty's wedding. I don't know. She's probably fine. Why don't you know? Aren't you'll in touch? Everyone's busy with their own lives. I'm going to bed. If we try... we can... speak to one another... Good night. I'll give you the printout tomorrow Where's Dad? Do me a favour and shave at least? I want you to meet a girl. If the money's good, just say yes. Look, Krish. I've never forced you to do anything. Don't behave like this with me. Then how should I behave? Fine. I'll just shut up, then. First my husband, now my son. I thought at least my in-laws would respect me once you got married... but no. You want me to go and beg in front of those Madrasis. Shipra's right. Everyone is selfish. Everyone. I've never, ever refused you. I'm tired of making up for Dad's faults. That's why I'm in this state. What are you trying to say? For once in life, I needed your help. And what did you do? You turned away. Where do I go nov? I'm a fool. I disgust myself! I love Ananya and I'm still letting her go. Mom, you talk of community, religion, Madrasis, Punjabis... you married a Punjabi, right? What came of it? And where were you? What is it to you? This family is beyond repair. Hello? Hello? Krish. Ananya... Did you mis-dial? I'm sorry about the other day... But you could have told me. What? That your dad was coming to my house. What do you mean? He spent the whole day with Mom and Dad... He apologized on behalf of your mother. My dad... apologized? Yes. My parents are so happy! In fact, they asked if we had a date in mind. Ls there? A date you have in mind? Krish... In trying to bring everyone together... have we grown apart? I haven't gone away, Ananya. I'm right here. I love you, Krish. Me too, Ananya. Do you mean it? I'm losing my mind... I can't eat or sleep. All I think about is you. Isn't it clear? I love you. Good. Now, it seems convincing. Hang on. My dad was at your house? Didn't you know? No... We'll talk in the morning. Yes... Good night. Good night. Did you go to Chennai? Thank you. You knew. I'm a bad man. Not a stupid one. I didn't want to lose my son in my old age. They're nice... Ananya's parents, nice people. Yes... I can't come to your wedding, Krish. For the first time in years I've done something right... I'm afraid... if I come... I'll ruin it... You know I can't get along with your mother's family. You won't come to my wedding? Look, Ananya is coming to our home. Right? Then why do you want to put me through my paces? That day... I wanted to hug my father. But that would've been melodramatic, right? Suddenly if everything falls into place... life becomes boring. Okay, tell me what happens in a Brahmin wedding. A lot. Prepare your family to see a lot of new rituals. All Punjabis want to see is alcohol. Done! Everything will be fine, right? Of course. Ananya, come here. Come soon. I miss you. I miss you, too. "Hurray!" "Hurray!" "The bride and groom make a gorgeous pair!" Just pray we don't get fall sick with all that sambar! Joke! "Breaking traditions and reigning chaos" "Weaving a love story on the crossroads of destiny" "The pongal pot is boiling My love speaks to you" "The husband brings good luck, girl" "Running with love Did she catch me?" "Or was she caught?" "Here comes the bride's carriage" "With the fancy band dancing" "Symphonising with trumpets!" Namaste. Excuse me... Can we have a word with you? Of course. "Hope springs in the air" "Hurray!" "Oh, the bride..." "Hurray!" What happened? They asked us what gifts we wanted! What did you ask for? TV? Fridge? Bungalow? Boat! Do I think I'm crazy? She didn't ask for anything! She got emotional unnecessarily! She said she wished for one MBA, she'd getting two! What better gift than that?! ' Really? Yes! ' You know what your problem is, Krish? You have no idea how much I love you. Let's g0! Who on eanh gets married at 6.30 in the morning?! Only yoga classes happen that early! Boy's father? J ust a second! - Coffee? - Yes, please. "l can't tear my eyes away" "As they seek your acceptance, too" "The kohl of your eyes tinges my days" "While the smell of your perfume haunts my nights" "Spellbound, this mind..." "Speaks only your name" "Spellbound, this mind..." "Speaks only your name" "Would that it could..." but it can't forget" "Spellbound, this mind..." "Speaks only your name" "Spellbound, this mind..." "Speaks only your name" The boy's mother will sit there... and if the father isn't here, then any senior member can- Father is here. What is he doing here? He arrived last night. Namaste! Please. I've made a lot of mistakes... will you hate me all my life? "Our hearts sing the song That tells our story" Why do our parents oppose this? - It's not about communities... It's about us finding love without their consent... If we fall in love with someone, doesn't mean we love our parents any less... Love doesn't need to be divided; It's all encompassing. They should be proud that, like them, now our love is unconditional. From our first word to our first cigarette... they've seen it all. Now they suddenly feel betrayed. That's why they get angry. Maybe after 25 years, when we're in their shoes... maybe then we'll understand. subtitled by SELVAHEMA
