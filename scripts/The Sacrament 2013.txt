Just a few nights ago, we were all hanging out together when he let slip a comment about his sister that had us practically speechless for the better part of an hour. After hearing the full story, we immediately thought, we have got to do a piece on it. Should I read it? Read it. Okay, it says, "Dear Patrick, sorry you have not heard from me in so long. I have been working hard with everyone to build a community where we can finally live free as God intended. We're not there yet, but we're so close. It's the most beautiful place I have ever been and I would love if you came to visit. We have so much love here but I miss your face." Then it says "Love, Caroline," and there's a phone number. We've been to some of the most chaotic, fucked up, war-torn places in the world, but never somewhere for something as personal and bizarre as this. So here we are, about to leave New York City, to set out to find your sister in a remote part of the world, to see what this community she is living in is really all about. Maybe we can call this one the "VICE guide to the Carter family reunion". One night to be confused one night to speed up truth We had a promise made Four hands and then away Both under influence We had divine scent To know what to say Mind is a razor blade To call for hands of above To lean on Wouldn't be good enough for me, no To call for hands of above To lean on Wouldn't be good enough for me, no I'll be back tomorrow at 8:00 a.m. I'll wait for one hour and then I will leave. With or without you. - Don't worry, we'll be here. - I'm not worried. 8:00 a.m. - Who is Patrick? - Yeah. That's me. We were not told you'd be bringing others. There are three total. Is there a problem? We're all together. We have to get clearance to bring them to the Parish. Please, stop filming me, sir. They came with me. I can't just leave them here. My sister invited us. My sister's name is Caroline Carter. Hold on. - I don't understand if there's problem. - Hold on. It should be all arranged. Okay. Bring them in. Copy that. It's okay. - Come with me. - Let's go. It's okay. - Get in the back. - The truck? Get in the back. So far so good. Well, here we are, we made it, kind of. We don't have a local fixer on this one, and the first thing that happens is Patrick almost getting into an argument with one of our guides. You know those are the guys you want on your side when you are out in places like this. Maybe New York has made me soft, but these are the moments, every time we make one of these things, where I realize - it might have been the worst idea ever. - No, we've definitely had worse ideas. No, we've definitely had worse ideas. I don't know why you're laughing. Get a shot of his shoes. Where did you think you were going, wearing shoes like those? I thought you traveled for work all the time? Yeah, to LA, and fucking Paris. Closest I come to this shit is shooting some model in a field in Jersey. Dude, you're in fashion, you should own some boots. Turn the camera off! Turn it off! Turn it off! So things have not improved. We didn't get shot, but we have to be careful not to let them catch us filming. Patrick is over there explaining who we are, what we're doing. I'm not sure if that will make things better or worse. We're hoping that he can find his sister and straighten all this out. And if Patrick starts to get shot at, I'm going the fuck that way. As quickly as possible. They want our passports, but I'm not giving up my passport to anybody. Also, there is some talk of a donation. Not sure how sizeable that donation has to be. So far this is nothing at all like the hippie commune we were expecting. - Patrick? - Okay. See, there she is. Hey, it's okay guys. It's okay. Caroline, did you tell them? All right, come on guys. - Oh, I'm so glad you're here. - I'm so glad to see you. - What's with all this? - Oh, I'll explain it inside. - Hi. - Hi. - I'm Caroline. Nice to meet you. You too. - I'm Sam, this is Jake. Hi. We didn't know you were coming. I'm so sorry. It's just... We're really happy to have you. There's someone cleaning out a cabin right now for you both. Great. - Is it all right if I keep filming? - Yeah. Yeah, of course, of course. You can film whatever you like. I would just hope that you would leave this last experience out. It in no way reflects what you are about to see. The guns are just a precautionary measure because of where we are. Down here everything needs some level of security. - Sure, we understand. - You want to go inside? - Yeah. Yeah. - Yeah? Okay, cool. Thanks, guys. My God, I can't believe I'm looking at you right now. - Your hair is so short. - Yeah, I cut it. - You look good. You look healthy. - Thank you. Oh, just wait until you see it all. Here we are.Welcome to Eden Parish. Oh, just wait until you see it all. Here we are. Welcome to Eden Parish. What do you think? It's great, right? Children, we have some special visitors to the parish today. Let's show them our hospitality and represent ourselves in the ways the Lord has taught us. - God bless you all. - Oh, yeah. I don't think that we slept more than three hours in a night for six months when we were building it. But Father had a vision, and he was of course right. And we built Heaven here on Earth. - Who is Father? - Oh, right. Yeah. Probably sounds weird to you guys, huh? Well, he's the guy that started all of this. He's the reason that I'm still alive. He's the reason that all of us are here. He's a genius, I swear. I know it sounds strange, but we all call him that because it's just easier for us. - Is that him on the loud speaker? - Uh-huh. Can we speak with him at some point? Um. Let me see what I can do. I know you guys are Patrick's friends and everything, but we've got to be really careful about media exposure. None of this would be possible without some level of secrecy. Secrecy, from whom? People like us? Or you mean like the local government? A little of both. There are some people out there that want to stop what we're doing. They think it's wrong, but I personally have no idea why anyone would think that this was wrong. I've never been so happy in my entire life, and we grew up wealthy on the upper west side. But that's not living, at least not to me. This is living. We all built this together as a community. We would do anything to keep it safe. So some of our residents agreed to move out of here so that you guys could stay here with us tonight, but Patrick is going to stay with me in the main house. And I know it doesn't seem like much, but you guys should be pretty comfortable for the night. When we first got here, some of our residents said that they had the best sleep of their lives. It's so peaceful and just wait until you see the stars. - They're so beautiful. - It's great, thank you. Should we come find you once we get settled? We would actually like to talk to you at some point if you're cool with that. Yeah. Sure, sure. Just... but take your time because I would really - love to spend some time with my brother. - Take him, we can't give him away. But really, if you guys need anything at all, anything, the main house is just across the field, just behind that pavilion. - Do you see it? - Yeah. Feel free to just wander around and get acquainted with the place. Our residents are really nice people. - Sounds good. - Mm-hmm. - You ready? - Yeah. Well, welcome. - Thanks. - Mm-hmm. Okay, I guess I'm going to go with her for a bit. - All right. See you in a few. - Later. See you, man. You want the top or bottom? She's selling this place pretty hard. Right? - Best night's sleep of your life... - Yeah. How freaked out were you back on the truck? Dude. Why did they have machine guns? I'm gonna switch cards so if anything gets weird, we at least have the footage we shot so far. Good call. Peace I give you, children. Do not let your hearts be troubled. Do not be afraid. It's another day for us in paradise. Hi. when brothers and sisters live in unity. God bless you all. Hi. I do not know who to approach first. They'll come to me. Hey, how you doing? Not that one, I guess. Oh, got her. Got her. - Hi. - Hi. How are you? - I'm fine. How about yourself? - I'm very well. My name is Lorraine Davis, but everyone around here just calls me Miss D. So how did you get involved with this place? Through the church. Now Father had came into the area where we lived and I had seen signs plastered all around town. Signs inviting people to come out and to help better themselves and to get a better relationship with God. So I went down there to the church and before that sermon was over, I was sold. That man has a way of speaking, a way of making you just feel better, and I'd never felt that way before. And it wasn't long after that he chose me to be one of the lucky ones to come down here and be a part of all of this. Oh, were you reluctant to leave your home? Oh, no. After my husband had passed, there just wasn't anything here for me. My faith is what was most important. This is right where I belong. We're with VICE. We want to talk with someone around our age about what it's like living here. I know VICE. - Cool. Are you from Australia? - Melbourne, yeah. How did you end up here? I mean, what were you doing before you came to this place? - I was an artist living in Brooklyn. - What kind of art do you do? All kinds. Painting, poetry, performance. Do you ever miss the technology you were accustomed to? Even just communicating easier or knowing what's going on with the outside world? You must, a little bit? I don't need the internet to communicate. People lived without it for thousands of years. It's just another unhealthy addiction. Here we talk to each other in person, not through satellites. What about your family in Australia? Do they know where you are? This is my family now. Father has given me more than I ever dreamed of. I'm so grateful for that. Okay. Fair enough. Thanks. Oh, hi. - Hi. Can we come in? - Sure. What is this place? This is our medical center and temporarily our day-care. I help with any conditions our residents may have, especially our seniors. And Miss Phoebe in there helps takes care of some of the children while their parents are in the fields. Are there a lot of children and seniors here? Oh, yes. We have over 35 boys and girls under the age of 10, and at least 60 or so seniors. That's how our parish really got its start, helping those seniors. Has anyone actually been born here? Oh, we've birthed seven babies to date. Seven? All here? That's right. Right here. Why are you so surprised? People are born around the world every day in conditions worse than this. It's not the hospital that has the baby, it's the mother. He's just nervous because his wife's pregnant. - Really? When is she due? - Next month. - Is this your first? - Yeah. The first are the most exciting. Congratulations. Thank you. Where do all these supplies come from? Do you get them locally? Well, we brought a lot with us, but thank heavens we haven't needed to use much of the medication. But we are prepared for all types of emergencies. Who pays for it all? We did. Well, in so many words, anyway. When many of us first came to the parish, we sold everything we had. When several hundred people come together, you would be surprised that how much you can get accomplished. Everyone just gave up what they had to come here? That's right. We sold our homes and we donated the profits to the church. And we would do it again. Father is a businessman on top of all things. Sometimes that gets overlooked. - So where are you guys from? - Oh, we're from the hood, man. Yeah. I'm saying we had nothing where we was from. You know, five of us lived in two rooms. And that's how you want to live? Me, Robert, our mother and two sisters, we all came down here together. And I mean, honestly, it's just changed us. We're from a violent community. I don't know, man. If we didn't come down here, - God knows what would have happened to us. - Oh, yeah, yeah, if you had told us we'll be out there with the white dudes and all these people... Yeah, yeah. We'd just say you was crazy. It's like, we look at you all and it's like you are the crazy ones. Yeah. I mean... This is how we're supposed to be living. You know, everybody here is in it together. That's right. You know, there's no one man for himself, it's like God watches over us. Yeah. - We watch over each other. - That's right, man. Do you see yourself ever going back to the United States? Never. There's no point. I ain't never going back, man. I'd die before I go back. It's real. Hey, can I play some ball with you guys? Yeah, man. Come on. - Can he ball? He can really ball. - No. So we talked to a bunch of the people here and what we know so far is that everyone thinks this is the best place they've ever been. They have their own farming, their own medical center, their own daycare, their own everything. As far as utopias go, it has something for everybody. If it's spirituality you want, they got it. If it's progressive politics, they got it. If it's a technology free hippy lifestyle you're looking for, they got that, too. I can't help but think desperation is a lot of what brought people here, but if they're happy now, who am I to say anything? We're about to head to the main house to meet back up with Patrick and Caroline to see if we can do an interview with this Father everyone keeps talking about. I'm trying to keep it together, so I can ask intelligent questions, but jet lag's kicked in and I am starting to melt. Jake, what do you think of all this so far? Give me your professional assessment. Um, I don't know. I mean, I'm naturally cynical, but... The fact that a bunch of drug addicts and alcoholics actually pulled this thing together is a little bit impressive. Fact that they sold all their worldly possessions to do it. I don't know, just throws up the red flag for me a little bit. I feel like, I mean, if this is like a place to come and get clean or do a little bit of thinking for a month, it's perfect. I think it is an actual sustainable lifestyle for, you know, 60 something elderly people. I mean, that medical center is great, but that's not really going to cut it, in my professional opinion. - What are you gonna ask this guy? - I don't know yet. Are you going in with tough questions or you're just gonna wait and see what the vibe is? I'm coming at him. Okay. Well, I'm gonna see if he'll wear a wire, gonna try and mic you guys up. Sam, we got a little one. Hi. What's your name? Savannah. There you are. Well, I've been looking all over for you. - Hi, Savannah. - Don't mind her. She is a mute. Oh. - You friends of Caroline's? - Yeah. We're with VICE. We want to maybe do a story about this place. - What kind of a story? - We don't really know yet. You're not gonna make fun of us, are you? No, not at all. We were just saying how impressive all this is. I see. Hey, would you mind doing a quick interview? We talked with a few people about how they ended up here and it'd be great if we could get - a mother's perspective on that. - No, thank you. We're not allowed to talk about the Parish, especially to outsiders. Come on, sweetheart. - Did she just call us outsiders? - Yeah. - It's kind of a different vibe, huh? - Yeah. - Hey. - Hey. How are you doing? I'll see you guys later. - You guys enjoying yourselves so far? - Definitely. Yeah? So good news. I spoke with Father and he agreed to allow you an interview. - Great. - Yeah. He is not really feeling very well right now. - He just took some of his medication. - Oh, is he sick? No. It's nothing serious. It's just sometimes the medication upsets his stomach. So he agreed to sit for an interview tonight at the gathering. We're planning an event for your visit. It should be really fun... It's gonna be music and dancing, you'll love it, especially you. So we would love it if you would look over this document I prepared. It'll give you a little bit more information about us and it should help with your questions. He is only gonna sit for half an hour and then the party will begin. What time does the party start? It begins at sun down. If you just want to meet me in front of the pavilion, and then I'll take care of the rest. - Perfect. Thank you. - Okay. Of course. We have nothing to hide. So if you'll excuse me, I have some more planning to do before tonight, so I'll just see you guys in a little bit. - Sounds good. - Okay. - Yeah. Thanks, Caroline. - Mm-hmm. How is it going, man? Man, I got some amazing pictures so far, dude. I can make a whole book out of this. Look at these faces, man. Jesus. You know, I can make something really cool out of this and it'd be great for me, What have you guys been up to? Well, we talked to a bunch of the locals. Oh, no, that's what my ticket on fashion looks like. - What have you guys been up to? - Well, we talked to a bunch of the locals. - And? - It's pretty wild. Yeah. Strange group of people. Nah, it's incredible. Had a few bizarre interactions, but you know... Where I'm staying, a full extra bedroom, office, can't even wrap my head around it. The construction aspect is pretty impressive I have to admit. Do you think your... Do you think your sister wants to stay? It seems like it. I thought I was gonna have to come here and rescue her but she seems good and she's definitely done worse. I don't know how I'm gonna describe this to my parents, but... Um, we're rolling, so let's do that letter. All right. "Distinguished guests..." Well, does it say distinguished guests? Says it. "Welcome to Eden Parish. Father wants only to create a community where peace and love are cherished, where the needs of one another are met on equal levels as we're all God's children and it is how He Himself intended us to live. We do not seek to isolate ourselves from the outside world, but we do seek a distance from imperialism, violence, poverty, racism and all other unacceptable attacks on basic human rights. These conditions have all become commonplace in modern societies. Father created Eden Parish not as a place to get away, but as a place to start over. It is a new beginning. Sincerely, the loving congregation of Eden Parish." Define imperialism. Define imperialism. Idiots. - You're getting a signal? - No. Okay. What are you doing on your phone? Dude, she is still gonna be pregnant tomorrow when you get home. They might have a satellite phone in the office. They don't have a satellite phone in the office. You know, you don't need to encourage this kind of behavior. Okay but I saw a room with a lot of equipment. He is fine. You're fine. Would all Parish members please report to the pavilion no later than 7:45. We're having a very special meeting tonight, for Father and our visitors. Everyone is required to attend. God bless. So we're gonna have you guys set up over here and then Father will come out when you guys are ready. Wait, hold up. We're doing this in front of everybody? Yeah. That's right. Great. So just let me know when you're all set, okay? - Hey, Patrick? - Yeah. - Hey, man, does your camera shoot video? - Yeah. Think you could help me get some video during this? Definitely. Where do you want me to shoot from? I mean, anywhere where you can get a good shot of Sam asking some questions and then you can flip around and get some shots of people, that'd be awesome. All right, maybe I'll just set up over here. Yeah. Thanks, man. Well, light looks pretty good. Father's here! Hi. Nice to meet you. Yeah. All right, all right. Let me get rigged up here. All right. All right. Well, I trust your stay so far has been hospitable. What we lack in modern comfort, we make up for in humanity. Isn't that right? It's been pretty amazing. Everyone we talked to seems to feel that this is everything they ever wanted and they all credit you for that. Oh, I don't deserve the credit. We all did this together. We built this place from the ground up. This is our community and you being our visitors, it is just as much yours. That's what we believe in. I want to talk more about that, but I would love to get some basics out of the way first. Are you feeling better? Caroline mentioned you were little under the whether earlier, - so I hope this is not too much. - Oh, yeah. I'm fine. Great. Okay, so first off. Can I ask your real name? Everybody here has been calling you Father and I wonder how that started. Well, it's a nickname. I don't remember exactly when it started, but it was many years ago. Some people see anyone who extends a helping hand as a father figure. And yes, that's where it came from. My given name is Charles Anderson Reed. That's a great name. Where are you from and how did all of this get started? Can you take us through it? Oh, I am from all over, friend. I've been in every big city and every small town. And you know what I found? Poverty, violence, greed and racism. The foundations of a cancerous society and I felt it to make a difference. You see all these people here tonight? They all came here because they had nothing. They were born outcast. Never given a chance. I know, 'cause so was I. Society turned its back on these people years ago, but I never will. I grew up poor. I know that pain. I know what it's like to lose hope, to feel trapped. Well, there's none of that here. You come down here and I'll give you a place to live. I'll give you a job, I'll give you some good, I'll give you a bed. - Whatever you need. - That's right! And we could live our lives, friend. Truly live. There is definitely a sense of togetherness, but I do wonder if this isolation is the only way to achieve that. Well, I had hoped not, but I believe for the time being that's so. You see, we built this congregation over many years. We travel around and preach a good word, wherever we went. And every stop we made we'd pick up one or two of God's lost children. You know what we found more often than not? It's a struggle to bring people together. America is coming apart at the seams because of the way it's being run, and the values it instills. Your government is failing, friend. Now before you call me a communist or socialist or whatever word you use for somebody who tries to help this fellow men, let me remind you of one thing, all the great leaders who have tried to achieve what we have here were struck down and killed. That's right. Malcolm X. Martin Luther King. Oh, my God. J.F.K. R.F.K. Well, I'm willing to die for what I believe in, but why die fighting when you can remove yourself from the fight altogether and create something new. A place without violence. Romans Chapter 12 verse 2. "Do not conform any longer to the pattern of this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind." And that way you can test and prove God's will. God's good and pleasing and perfect will. That's what we do here, see? We are continuing our cause peacefully. Surely you can appreciate that. Absolutely. Speaking to that point, when we came in, we noticed there were a few men with guns. If this is a pacifist community, and it seems as if it is, why the guns? Is there some paranoia about the outside world? Today a woman even called us outsiders. Oh. You see, this is why I don't like the media. We have been speaking five minutes and you're already looking for some negative angle to explore. Oh, no, I don't blame you, Sam. It's not your fault. You don't even know you're doing it. It's just the way you've been conditioned. Come in here from a sick, violent society, it's only natural that you'd be less interested in the beauty of our community than in the guns we use to protect the borders. I wasn't saying... What we're doing here is radical, Sam, there's no doubt about it. And it is complicated, that's why I want to explain it to you. I have sympathy for your misunderstanding. We all do. We all used to think just like you. Let me just say that there are certain government agencies that have been watching me and my congregation for many years, everybody knows that. I do not keep it secret. But I made a promise to these people that I would lead them to a better existence and that includes protecting them. It's our home down here, we have to preserve it. That's understandable. Yeah, see? I knew he'd catch on. Living in that beehive New York City has jaded you completely. That's good. So... It must have cost quite a bit of money to create all this. Was it just through donations all these people's life savings? Oh, Sam. I hate you, you phrase it like that. Is that what money means to you? A life? We don't worship capitalism and materialism. We came down here to live off the land. That's why America started, but they don't allow it anymore. Yeah, if you're not paying taxes then you go to jail. Exactly. That is exactly right. Now, Sam, let me ask you a question if I may. Look around here, look at all these people. Do you see anybody who looks like they ought to go to jail? It doesn't look like it, no. That's right. I see you wear a ring on your finger. You are married man, are you? Yes. Oh, that's good. You love your wife? Excuse me? A simple question. Do you love your wife? - Yes, of course. - And you'd do anything for her. And what about that child you have on the way? Oh, what's wrong? You seem caught off guard by my question. Interesting when the shoe is on the other foot, isn't it? And I suppose you were wondering how I knew that about your wife, aren't you? Oh, relax, Sam. I'm just making a point here. You see, I love these people here just as much as you love your wife and your unborn child. These people, my family, my children. And when you write this up for your readers, I want you to remember that. And when you start to put that spin on it, just know that you're dealing with their lives, with those faces. Look at the joy on those faces. Remember what you're seeing tonight, Sam. You have a great responsibility. I hope you're aware. I am. But we don't spin things. We try to be honestly subjective. We don't have an agenda, we're just trying to document things that are meaningful. Oh, yeah, that's right. Caroline told me that. That's why I agreed to this interview. You know, I don't believe in the media. I see it always lies upon lies upon lies. Anything that'll sell more copies. But I look at you, Sam, and I can tell you're different. I can see that you care. We try. Yes, you do. Well, are there anymore questions or can we quit all this and get on to the celebration we got planned? We got a wonderful band. I know you're gonna love him. - I guess we're fine. - All right. Yo, so that was one of the strangest interviews I've ever done. Shit. Man. Yeah, if you could see, I only... Yeah, I only got through about a quarter of my questions and really I'm not sure if any of those even got answered. Everything just sort of got swept up in this weird energy and I couldn't think straight. He had a way about him. That's hard to focus. Well, the thing about my wife really stunned me. And you were saying that he must have heard it from one of the people we talked to, which makes sense, but man, fuck me, it was all just so jarring. All that clapping. I hope it wasn't worthless. See, they're setting up for a party and hopefully we can get some better footage to make up for me dropping the ball like that. Sorry, man. There's a ton of good stuff, man, I don't think you should worry about it. With Patrick... When all God's children get together What a time, what a time, what a time We're gonna sit down by the banks of the river What a time, what a time, what a time When all God's children, get together What a time, what a time, what a time We're gonna sit down by the banks of the river What a time, what a time, what a time When all God's children, get together What a time, what a time, what a time We're gonna sit down by the banks of the river What a time, what a time, what a time We're gonna have a time What a time We're gonna have a time What a time We're gonna have a time What a time We're gonna have a time What a time We're gonna have a time What a time We're gonna have a time What a time We're gonna have a time What a time Okay, I've completely turned the corner on this place. I'm a fan of this goat. And people seemed really psyched, party was great even without any booze. I'm starting to be able to see why people want to live like this. I mean, I wouldn't, but I think I'm starting to better understand where they're coming from. I dig it. Music's actually really good. And I fucking hate church music. Yeah, he wasn't lying about that. Patrick's having a good time wherever he is. He might not want to come back with us. Oh, heads up. Hey, Savannah. You're having a good time? What? Is this for me? Thank you. - What is it? - I don't know. What is it? What's it say? Oh, shit. Fix me, Jesus, fix me - Where is she? - I don't know. Oh, fix me Oh, fix me Oh, fix me Fix me, Jesus, fix me And there's the guards. What are they doing with guns? I don't like this. We got to find Patrick. Patrick? He's not in here. Fuck. What is all this shit? Let's get out of here. Sam, hold on. Safe's open. It's all their passports. Dude, I don't give a shit. Let's go. Leave it, man. Holy shit. - It's all their passports. - Dude, I don't give a shit. Let's go. I got to get some shots of you looking through this shit. Somebody's coming, Jake, come on. Come on. Can I help you guys? Yeah, we were just looking for your brother. His room's just right around the corner. Oh, he is not here right now. Huh? I completely forgot. He is busy. Busy doing what? I've been telling Allison and Sarah about him And they're just so happy that he's finally here. So they took him. Threesomes aren't particularly Christian, if I'm remembering Sunday school correctly. Well, we all have to sin every once in a while as long as Father approves. He approved getting your brother laid? One must not question what's best for the Parish. How so? I love my brother and I miss him so much. And I think that he would be so happy here and we're just trying to show him that. Don't you think he'd miss New York, his job? He can be a photographer here. And he has all these ideas... This idea about this book about the Parish, I think it's brilliant. And my parents can support him and we're expanding all this and we need money. And if Patrick stays then we can get the money and... Yeah, you want your parents to send money to help build this place out. It's a donation. It's the same as you. It's... We just need to get through this next phase and then we'll be completely fine. Oh, are you all right? Yeah. Yeah. Caroline, I need your assistance. I'm coming, Father. If you see Patrick, tell him to come see us. Okay. Just relax. You're in paradise. You fellows seem lost. Do you need someone to walk you back to your cottage? No. We're fine. You sure about that? You wouldn't want to walk into the wrong place. Why? Is there something you don't want us to see? It's just an expression, friend. It's late, you want to go poking around other people's business, you go right on ahead. But if you put your hand into the dog's bone, don't be surprised if you get bit. What's that supposed to mean? You boys have a nice evening. Sam, let's just drop it. Patrick? Sam, come on. Shit. What the fuck is going on here? Did he just threaten us? I'm not sure. Do you think he knows we were in the office? Anyway, is Patrick's sister hiding his files? I know she is not supposed to be. They're just using Patrick? I don't know. I don't know what's going on anymore. This is too fucked up. These people are happy living here. Good for them, but I don't want to get any more involved. I'm done. Also, if she's getting high and sleeping with the guy, what's the point of this place? It's supposed to be sober living, right? I mean, she looks an awful lot like the fucked up sister Patrick was describing. Savannah? Where is she, dude? Where did she go? I don't know. Please, take us with you. What? You don't know what's really going on here. They will kill us if they know we were talking to you. Who? Father. This place is not what it seems like. They hurt people who go against the Parish. Please, you have to help us. Wait, wait, wait, wait. What do you mean? They keep it secret, but it happens. Father will not let us leave. We're prisoners here. You are being manipulated. We talked with plenty other people, they all seemed happy. No. You talked with who Father wanted you to talk with. Many other people won't tell you but they are afraid to speak out. You don't understand the hold he has over a lot of them, they're brainwashed and don't even know it, they'll do anything he asks. Your friend's sister is one of them. She has done terrible things to people who act tough. Savannah saw them. They beat my daughter, that's why she won't speak anymore. Please, please, help us. I don't know what we can do. Our helicopter comes in the morning, but it's not big enough to carry many more people out. - Then just take my daughter. - What? Please, don't let her die. I beg you. Shh! Ssh! Somebody is coming. Oh, God. Hey, it's okay. It's okay. What is going on here? We found her wandering out here. We're trying to find out where she lives. She doesn't talk much. - I will take her. - Oh, it's okay. We can do it. I know where she lives. I will take her. Where is your mother, Savannah? I will go tell Father. Let's go. Jesus Christ. Come on. Let's just get back inside. They were terrified. We shouldn't have let him take her. Why the fuck did we let them take her? What were we supposed to do? We can't take anyone with us. We could've done something. Sam, it's not why we're here. It's not our problem. It's not why we make these films, you're losing sight of things. We can report this when we get back, but it's not up to us to decide what happens to these people. We're not the Red Cross. Did you see those scars? How could she let her daughter be beaten like that? That's all for tonight. It's been wonderful. Return to your cottages and be thankful for the joy we have in our lives. Will Wendy and the clean up crew please meet me at the pavilion in 15 minutes? God bless you all. Look at them just do exactly what he tells them. Brainwashed. Look, the helicopter is gonna be back here in 8 hours. Let's just pack our bags and be ready to go, seems like everybody is going to sleep. I don't think anything else is gonna happen tonight. You know, let's just try and get some rest and hopefully things will calm down. But when the sun comes up, we're gonna get Patrick, we're getting the hell out of here. What is this place? Well, it's officially 5 o'clock. So much for the greatest night's sleep of our lives. Tried to go to sleep about an hour ago. Whatever they're doing in the pavilion seems to have stopped, so it's been quiet. Oh. Neither of us could sleep. It's a weird night. Looks like it's finally getting to us. Well, I'm actually really scared. It's the most scared I've been in a long time. Ready to go home. All right, it's morning now. We made it through the night. There appears to be some kind of group of people gathered outside of the pavilion. It's unclear what exactly is going on over there, but we're gonna have to just go find Patrick and start to make our way back to the air strip. You see this? Jesus Christ. What the hell is going on? Hey, what the fuck is happening? Dude, what's going on? This has been happening for an hour. These people want to leave, I started filming 'cause I knew you'd want it. - I have no idea what to do. - All these people want to leave? They all know we have a helicopter coming and they want on it. We can't take all these people with us. I told them, I keep telling them, they won't listen. Caroline has been freaking out all morning. I don't know what to do. Hi. - Is everything all right? - Yeah, it's fine. We haven't had anyone come here for over a year and so you guys being here is really stressing them out. Okay, can I... Can I ask you on the record Okay, you know just really don't concern yourselves. It's fine. Everything... This is nothing. Caroline, this is not nothing. These people want to leave. You can't keep them here. Listen, you guys... They can't leave. They have to stay here. Their families are here. Do you want to break up their families? Hey, wait a minute. They are allowed to leave, right? Of course, they are. That's not what I'm saying. You guys need to go to the helicopter right now. Hey, Sam! Sam! Sam, do not get involved in this. What are you doing? Come on. Please, take her with you. Calm down, Wendy. No one is taking her anywhere! I told you, our helicopter is too small. You could take just her. Dude, no. Go ahead and get to the field, ask how many people it can hold, I'll stay back here and figure this out. Sam, this is crazy. - We can't take anybody with us. - Just her. I can't leave her like this, man. Just get there before the pilot leaves. Have one of the guys radio back. That'll work, right? Just don't let that helicopter leave without us. Go, hurry. Caroline, where's the ride? All right. I'll radio back soon as I know what we can do. You're sure you know, when we come back Trust in your brother... It's gonna be okay. It's fine. We're not gonna leave without you, okay? - You cannot do this. - Back off! We're not gonna leave you, I promise. What happened? Where is Jake? We need to figure this out. - Caroline, where are you going? - I have to get Father! He warned me about this, he was right about you, he was right about all of you. You came here to destroy us from within. I didn't want to believe it, I fought for you to come here. You are not my family, I made a big mistake. Stop fucking filming me. Hey! Hey! Hey. Where are the others? They're coming, they're coming. How many more people can fit in this? No, that was not the deal. No one else comes. No, it's just... It's a mom and her daughter and my friend's sister. - No, I told you. - No, she's sick. We have to help her. - Only the ones I bring in, no exceptions. - Look, I don't understand, man... You're scaring the little one, you're scaring her. Hey, Sam, look out. Hey... Take the camera. I want you to film this. It's an order. Yes, Father. Do you see him? Where's he? He's gone. I think I see him. He's gone. What are we doing? Why are we chasing him? It was Father's orders. This is the end he talked about. Nobody can leave here alive. Hurry up, children, please hurry. I need you all to hear what I have to say. Every family, every one of them, come on, we don't have much time. You must be here. This concerns all of you. I need you here with me now, quickly, quickly, quickly. Come on in. Everybody, come in here. Have a seat, please be seated. Everyone be seated please, have a seat. I've got something to tell you, so settle down. You know I love you. Yes, Father. I gave you all I had. But there comes a day when the quality of your life matters more than the time you've got left to live. Oh, the men came here and destroyed everything we worked for. We can't let them go back to New York. No. No. Because they would spread lies about us and what we have here. Yes, Father. Then their government would send soldiers here to burn our homes and take our children and kill us all! No, no. That's right, we can't let that happen, no! I will not let that happen. Now I didn't want to hurt these men, but somebody will come looking for them, you know they will. Yes, Father. So where do they go? Or where do they stay? This is the end for us. Our time has finally come. Oh. Oh, mother, precious mother, I'll come with you, Father. Take me with you. I know you will. Some of you have been with me since the beginning. We knew this day might come. We talked about it and we planned for it. Some of the children have already been given the potion. Oh, no. We don't wait to be murdered. We don't wait to be struck down like dogs. Take your drink and lay down your life with your family. If we can't live our life this way, what earthly life is worth living? This is the last sacrament, children. They all know we're not afraid to die, but I want us to be able to choose our own death. We can go kindly and we can go quiet. This is our final test. Oh, I love you all. You've been so loyal to me all these years and we're gonna be together again. We are heading for eternal life. Where are they? They're gone. Please, I could still fly us out of here. Please help me, help me to my seat. Get your friends. Hurry. We don't have much time. Go, go. Don't struggle, no, don't struggle with it, don't you struggle. It's a bitter taste and then it's over. There's no pain, there's no convulsions and this is not suicide. We are not sinners, no, we're proving our faith here. Let's offer our bodies as a living sacrifice, holy and pleasing to the Lord, Romans 12:1. We can't go back, there's nowhere to go back to. So our time is up. Don't be afraid. Don't be afraid. It's just stepping over to the other side. That's all it is. Let's show the world that the only peace left for us is in death. We are going to a better place now. Let's all go together. It's just a little medication, that's all it is. We're just going to sleep. Everybody, get a drink now just like we rehearsed. Father, no, no, look, I'm sorry but this just don't make no sense. I mean, we all worked hard here, how are we just gonna give up like this? Oh, son, we're not giving up. I've never lied to you and I tell you now they will come down here with their guns and bombs and wipe us out. America's on the brink of another war. We don't deserve to die like that, we deserve peace. You all agree with that, that's why you came down here. Father. We have to go, so let's go together. Out time is up. Come on in, bring them in. That's right, that's right. Keep your dignity, son. We're all here with you. That's right, that's right, quickly, quickly. Mothers, help your children, tell them everything is all right. Go ahead and drink if you got a drink, drink it up. I tried to create a heaven here, you know, I tried. But now the time has come. Step over to the other side with our brothers and sisters, where the real heaven waits. Come over here, take more of this, take more. We all must take our drink. Take it. Take it. Take it. Take it. Take it. Take it. Take it. Take it. Anybody who receives this, something terrible happened here. I don't know why, but they're trying to kill us. I'm just gonna keep rolling and I hope that I get as much as possible, hope that this footage makes it out of here. Whatever happens, this story needs to be told. No, no. Come on. - Drink this. - No. It's okay... It's great, it's painless... No, no! Patrick, Patrick! It can go this way, it's so much easier. Come on, you silly, come on, Caroline. Where's the key? You need to find the key. No, no. What is that? What is that? What is that? - What did you just do? - It's okay. - What did you just do? - Okay. What did you just put in me? What did you put in me? Caroline, no, no, no, what is that? Don't leave me, don't leave me. You know I love you, I love you. We got to find Jake, I love you, I love you. Caroline, no, we can still go, we can still leave, We can still go home, think about mom and dad. Think about mom and dad. No, no, what is that? What did you put in me? What is that, Caroline? What did you put in me? No, no, let's get out of here. What is that? Shh! Shh! We're gonna die. I don't want to die. I don't want to die. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Caroline. Shh! Shh. Calm down, everyone, calm down. The potion works No, no. Don't let your families be murdered by these terrorists. This is the only remaining way for us to go. This is an active revolution. We'd rather die than go back to their way of life. This world will see it as just our sacrifice, but we won't let them take our lives, no! We are laying down our lives. So lie down. Lie down, children. Lie down and go to sleep. Just go to sleep. Sleep. Just go to sleep. Sleep. Sleep. Where is everyone? Oh, my God. What happened here? Andre? My mother, my brother, my sister, they are gone. Poisoned. Don't leave me. Shh. Shh. Are they going to heaven? All right. Don't leave me. Are we going to heaven? Oh, my God. Fuck. Sam! Sam? I'm not gonna let them hurt you. No, no, stop, it's okay, it's just me. We need to be quiet, please. Don't be afraid. Oh, shit, okay. They're coming, all right, come on, quick, we got to hide. Come on, get down, get down. I'm not gonna let them hurt you, I promise. Sshhh, get down in there. I'm not gonna let them murder my daughter. Please, they'll hear you. No, don't! What are you doing? It's all right. It's okay, it's all right. It's okay, it's all right, it's all right. Oh, shit, shit, shit. Oh. Caroline. Where did she go? Caroline? Caroline? What are you doing? Patrick's dead. Everything that we worked so hard for, it's all over now, I have to destroy. Caroline, stop, we can still leave. - And go where? - Go home. This was my home! All these people they were my family, they're all gone! Don't you understand? I have nothing left! Where is Sam? Father took him. Took him where? Caroline, don't do this! You should have never come here. No! Sam? Jake? Here we are, three of us. All that's left. We couldn't live this way anymore but I couldn't let him go. That's right, that's right. I gave them all I could and I gave them a way out. We were doing something great down here. We were gonna change the world, this was only the beginning. Why couldn't you leave us alone? What harm are we doing down here? We didn't do any of this. You brought violence on us. Are you proud of that? Do you take your responsibility for those lives? If not then step on over with the rest of us. No, just stop this. None of those people had to die. Everybody dies, friend, and greater love hath no man than this, that he laid down his life for his friends. That's how we used to teach it to the children. That's John 15:13. Please. I'm gonna be a father, I have a family. You don't have to do this. You destroyed my family. One day, you'll understand, you'll see it for what it is. I'm tired. I'm so tired. I gave it all I had. Now it's time to go. We have to show the world we're not afraid. It's our time now. No, it's not our time, we can still live. Blessed is the man who stands the test for he shall receive the crown of life that God promised to those who love him. No, what are you doing? Jake, he's got a gun. What? Hey, no. No, no, no. Get the key, it's in his pocket. Okay. Hold still. Hold still. Okay, quick, get up. Get up, Sam. Come on, the helicopter's waiting. We got to go, come on. Where is Patrick? He is dead, everybody is dead. Come on, we got to go, we got to get out of here before that pilot leaves, hurry. Sam, get down. Shh. Where is he? He's coming towards us. What do you want to do? I don't know. Oh, shit, he's inside the pavilion. Do you want to rush him? No. We can't, he's too far away. Get out of here. Get up, go! Let's go, come on, hurry. I'm burning this place to the ground. Go!
