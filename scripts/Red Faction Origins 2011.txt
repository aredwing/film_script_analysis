The second is the day the Earth was driven from it. Twenty-five years ago today, Mars became a free planet. Free from the tyranny of the Earth Defense Force. For 200 years, the E.D.F. ruled Mars with an iron fist. Our once proud mining colonies had become internment camps. Generations who considered themselves Martians... had become slaves on their own planet. Until one day, a small group of rebels said "No more." They called themselves Red Faction. They were led by Alec Mason, hero of the revolution. Hey, it is you. But Red Faction couldn't defeat E.D.F. alone. Man, let me buy you a drink. They formed an alliance with the Marauders... once the E.D.F. Was destroyed. The alliance was broken when Marauders killed Mason's wife and daughter. What are you having? They fought and bled... red blood on our red planet-- A solitary moment. Until the E.D.F. Was finally defeated. Forced to leave Mars, never to return. My fellow Martians, I urge you to stop. Stop and remember. On this day, generations ago-- You're just too good to have a drink with me, is that it? when dawn broke, we were in chains. When our twin moons rose, we were free men. Backup is four minutes out. Do not engage. I repeat, do not engage. Copy? Do you-- Alec Mason, you're under arrest for drunk and disorderly and disturbing the peace... again. Get outta here, you drunk! Let's go, Dad. With the computer upgrades I'm proposing, I think we can increase Red Faction's total output by at least-- Ms. De La Vega, I will consider your request, but if you'll excuse me, Lt. Mason and I have got things to talk about. What do you think you were doing? What was I supposed to do? Wait four minutes for backup like I told you. Why couldn't you just do-- Is this because I was born on Earth? Are you accusing me of being prejudiced against Terrans? No, sir. I just was not sure if you were aware... upon which planet I was born... on. You could be born on Pluto for all I care... so long as you do your job well. But-- And give me the proper respect. Now, can you guess which one of those... I think you need to work on? I'm sure today was tough for you. Just a day. A day when it's a little harder for you to forget that you're Alec Mason's son. I find that very easy. There's no paperwork on this one. I spoke to the saloon. They've decided not to press charges. Aren't you two even yet? There is no even for what your dad did for me. You're free to go. It's cold out. Terraformers make the air breathable. They don't make Mars closer to the sun. Want a drink? Why don't you sleep it off? Sobriety only happens if you let it, Son. You really kept the place up since I moved out. Yeah. This is what Mom would want for you? The dead don't want anything. It's one of the benefits of being dead. Mother, come! Jake, please, I'm scared! What's the matter with you? I gotta go. Hey. Hey, you were really great outside the saloon tonight. You reminded me of me. I hope not. The E.D.F. Dreadnought Hydra. We blew it up on the final day of the revolution. The fuselage has been in a graduated decay orbit ever since. The tail section is set to make planet fall approximately 1814. Satellite telemetry has it crashing somewhere near Bradbury. Bradbury? That's-- Disputed territory. Just on our side of the Marauders' defense perimeter. We're sure the Marauders know when and where the Hydra is coming down too. That's why it is imperative that we stake our claim first. Mason, your team will travel to the drop zone. Assess and recover any salvageable E.D.F. technology. All due respect, sir, I wouldn't know a useful piece of E.D.F. tech from an electric razor. That's why you'll be taking along an expert. Ms. De La Vega? All right. We're 30 clicks from Bradbury. Keep us up top. Don't want any Marauders taking a lucky shot at us. You okay? Why wouldn't I be? That actually does hurt. Sorry. I really don't like travel, you know, especially out of Eos. So you were born on Earth? Yeah, why? Is that a problem? Not for me. Good. Oh! Do you think that you could talk to me? Maybe just keep my mind off the turbulence. I'm not much of a talker. Tell me about your family. It must have been really embarrassing having to arrest your dad the other day. I'm beginning to get why I see you eating meals by yourself. You're one to talk. What's that noise? Anomaly. We're okay! We're okay! I've heard about anomalies, that they were real, but I never-- They happen randomly at the far edge of a terraformer's range. Unexplained phenomenon. - Usually they make things explode. But this ship won't. Good ship. Sir, you're gonna wanna see this. Where do you want me to land? Two and twos. Ez, establish a perimeter. If you come into contact with Marauders, report it A.S.A.P. Do not engage, but defend yourselves if necessary. Tess, you are with me. Crack it. Sir! There's lots of micro fractures. It's cold shearing from being in space for so long. I don't even know if any of this stuff is going to be salvageable. It's-- Whoa! Whoa! He must've been flash-frozen when the hull was breached. I think now's a good time to go back to the ship. I think now's a good time for you to take a deep breath. We have a job to do, and I need you. You are the best, right? By far. Okay. Okay. There's, um-- There's still activity. It's that way. Marauders. Sir, I can't raise Lt. Mason. Jake, please, I'm scared! - Lyra, jump! Marauders. I know. Stay here. Where are you going? Jake, come in. Jake? Jake? Jake! Are you all right? We had every right to claim the wreck. That land does not belong to Eos. Ben. Nor did the lives of my tribesmen, yet you sent them from Mars just the same. We did not kill your Marauders. Their wounds were inflicted by gunfire. Colonist weapons. Colonist duplicity. Our forces were securing a hazardous crash site... when they were attacked unprovoked. As is always the case with Colonists, you speak only in half truths. Know this to be the full truth-- Any further incursions into my territories... will be considered a hostile act. Any Colonist found trespassing on Marauder lands... will be summarily executed. That is a promise I will honor. The Matriarch is telling the truth. It wasn't Marauders. That group on the Hydra? They were soldiers in white fatigues. And one of these soldiers, she was a girl. Ben, look at me. It was her. Who? Lyra. This girl, when she saw me, it was like she knew too. She's alive. My sister is alive. This isn't a wish. This isn't a dream. It's a fact. Can you accept that? I didn't think you partook. It's water. Mind if I sit? Shouldn't you ask the owner since you helped trash this place the other night? Ben smoothed that over. He could always talk, that Ben. Talked me into doing stuff I didn't wanna do. I wonder, can he talk you out of something you wanna do, no matter how stupid? He shouldn't have called you. Maybe he thought you'd listen to me. He wouldn't think that. I've seen your sister, Jake. Just the other day, I saw some girl in town wearing her smile. Saw her eyes peering out of someone else's face. Her silly laugh coming out of some child's mouth, loud like a mine drill. And for a second, time freezes, and she's alive... with my Sam and we're-- Then the second hand moves, and she's dead. They both are. Marauders killed them. This girl you saw, it wasn't her. You need to accept that. You've done a great job accepting things. I don't drink because I haven't accepted it. I drink because I have. Let it go. Hi. What are you doing here? Well, good morning to you too. I'm serious. I'm serious too. I really want you to have a good morning. And it is not gonna be a good morning for you, if Major Sharpe discovers you disobeyed orders and went back to the Hydra. Who says that's where I'm going? Me. And I'm going with you. No, you're not. I've been going over the scans I took of the wreckage yesterday. That section of the Hydra had an intact communications array: Cobalt-level convertors, nuclear bolts, nanotechnology, iodine reactors. That stuff is valuable tech. It's all worth a lot. Hey, your white soldiers? They didn't take any of it. I wanna know what was in that cylinder that was more valuable. That's a pretty flimsy reason for you to wanna go. It's not any flimsier than looking for your long-lost sister... everybody else thinks is dead. I know where they went. - Tell me. - Take me. Take a look. Yeah? Terraformer. - Hey, Tess? - Yeah. - Hang on. We're in the Bakhuysen Trench. Red Faction won't be able to track us here. Satellites don't bother to scan this area. Because flying through here is insanity. - Better tighten your straps then. - Why? Why? Because if I'm strapped in when this thing crashes and explodes, I'm gonna be just fine? - Okay, Tess, where we headed? - Asimov. I extrapolated the white soldiers' course. It's the only possible destination. Asimov is in neutral territory, in the Outlands. Yeah, we kinda gotta cross through Marauder Nation to get there. All right, see down there? That's Heinlein. What is that? It's a mining community? The guy who runs the place is named McAuley. He's a good man. Friend of mine. My name carries weight with him. What does, uh, Heinlein have to do with Asimov? - You know how you hate flying, Tess? - Yeah? Now you're really gonna hate it. Tess, you okay? No, I am not okay! Are you insane? I'm sorry. I can't take you with me. Find my pal McAuley. He'll get you back to Eos. I will get you for this, you son of a-- Jake deserted. Why didn't thought he would obey my orders. If you thought that, then why'd you have me talk to him? Alec, we need to stop him before he enters the Marauders' territory. Do you have any way to contact him? You believe him about Lyra? I believe that he believes it. He says she's with the white soldiers who were there the day when-- the day Sam died. She was murdered. The Marauders, who thought she was a traitor for marrying me. Probably get a parade for their glorious efforts. Jake always said it was the white soldiers. Jake was 10 years old. He'd just seen his mother killed. Did you ever find any evidence of these phantom white soldiers? It's just his brain playing tricks. Wish mine would do it too. Maybe he just needed you to believe him anyway. "Maybe." It's about the worst word there ever was. I don't wanna kill you. Funny, I was just thinking exactly the opposite. - Drop the gun! - If I don't? I break your neck. Not before I blow a hole through his head. - Kill him. Be quiet! Drop your weapon. Are you carrying a singularity bomb? All Marauders carry singularity bombs. The fuses last Why? Because you've got - Give me the pin. - Drop the staff. Give me the pin! Hey! Hey! Marauders always honor a mortal debt, and a mortal debt is what you now owe me. You cannot kill me. How do you figure? I did just save you from being crushed into atoms by a singularity bomb. You are as crazy as a rock eater. I like that. Ah, ta, ta! Sorry about your tent. My nephew gets excited by new faces. He's a Colonist. He should not be here, Uncle. Well, we are honored. Not many Colonists know Marauder traditions. My mother was a Marauder. Her name was Samanya. You're Jake Mason? That a good or a bad thing? Well, depends on what you think of... Marauder females marrying outside the tribe. Luckily for you, it doesn't bother me in the slightest. Love doesn't know from maps, hey? I, Corvallis. And this fiery young pup is Leo. Where'd you get that? It was a gift... from my mother... before she died. - My mother's dead too. - Your mother was a traitor.  Marauders are taught that all Colonists are drunkards and heathens. We're told you're a bunch of gun-toting savages... who kidnap children in the middle of the night. I guess we don't know as much about each other as we think. His trouble is he knows all the wrong stuff. Every Marauder must face the wandering. His is not yet complete. My nephew's right. You should not be this side of the Marauder Frontier. Did you get lost? I need to get to Asimov. Asimov. What would you want there apart from drugs, gambling and the company of degenerates? In your travels, you ever come across a group of soldiers... wearing white fatigues? Can't say I have. I need to find them. Why? They take something from you? They took everything from me. Well, we wouldn't be fulfilling our mortal debt... if we left you out here to be killed, hey? We'll see you to Asimov. Get off. Off! Leave it alone. I thought you didn't drink. When in Asimov-- Wait. Leo? How old are you? Sixteen. I like older men. Leo! Leo! Your daddy? Get off, would ya? No, he's not my father. Good.   What'll you have? Name of the man who gets things done in this town. And water. [ Singing Continues, Indistinct ] The name will take a minute. Something wrong with your water? You got that name yet? Someone's here to see you. It took you long enough. In my defense, we are a long way from home. The safety's on. No, it's not. Oh! I've been driving for two days. Can I please have a sip of that? It's drugged. Why did you drug your own water? I didn't. The bartender did. Why would he do that? 'Cause the man I wanna see is involved in the black market. He might not wanna be seen. How the hell did you get here? Oh, your friend McAuley who runs Heinlein, who, by the way, is a really great guy, he lent me the vehicle. And then I hacked into the Marauder satellite-- Why did you follow me, Tess? I figured out what the white soldiers took from the Hydra. Look, It's called a firework. It's a power converter. In and of itself, it's not really all that dangerous, but it is what creates the spark. The spark in what? An E.D.F. fusion reactor. It's what they use to power their weapons, their ships, their everything. I think that there might be more at stake here than just finding your sister. Not for me. How do you even know that it's her? Everybody else thinks you're nuts, you know. What do you think? I think you really miss her. Every day, since the day my, uh, sister was taken, my dad has wanted to ask me a question. I saw it in his eyes when I woke up in the hospital. I saw it the other day... when we were fighting. One question always on his tongue, but never asked aloud: How could you leave your sister behind? He'll never have to ask that again. Have you ever been with a girl? Yeah. Next time someone asks you that, how'd you like to be telling them the truth? Just once I'd like to see someone not fall for that. Take him. I hear you've been looking for me. Something wrong with your water? I'm looking for a group of soldiers. They wear white uniforms. We know they've been in the market for an E.D.F. firework. Well, as it happens, I did do a tran-- I did do a transaction recently with some soldiers. They were in white uniform. They were cold people. I sold them some highly specialized ammunition. It's very difficult to procure. Hey! Drop him. I've heard some men make their own opportunities... by selling black market goods embedded with tracking devices... so they could-- Mmm. Uh, trace them, steal them back and resell them. The man who would think that would not be stupid. In fact, he'd be very clever. - How much? - Oh, for the tracking codes. Well, why don't we say 2,000? Okay, are you kidding me? Do you think I'm just walking around with that kind of money? Well, the man who wants that is. Oh, unless you've got something else you'd like to trade? No. Right. No, no, no, no, no. Oh, dear. Look, go home, Red Faction. Go live a long and stupid life. Now, cheerio. Damn it. I make my own opportunities too. I remote cracked the hardgate on his tracker, and I downloaded the codes. You wanna find the white soldiers? This is gonna take us right to them. You know how normally I'm the smartest person in the room? It's 'cause I'm the smartest person in the room. I should have sold you. - Are you all right? - Who were they? They're scavengers. Thought they could kidnap the boy and sell him back to his tribe for a ransom. Oh, dear. Just as well they didn't know you were worth less than nothing, eh? I- I called your mother a traitor, but you still saved me, why? I was more upset you hacked up my tent. According to this, they're somewhere inside the Madler Crater. How much did you have to drink in there? No one goes near the Madler Crater. Why not? It's at the center of three terraformer ranges. It's surrounded by anomalies. If there is a hell, believe me, it is envious of the Madler Crater. Thanks for getting me this far. Time has been unkind to you, Alec Mason. Time and everyone else on Mars. If your congress believes... that my resolve will weaken to a known face, they are more foolish than I thought. This is a personal call. Really? They will trace your signal. This is a treasonous act. It's my son. He entered your kingdom. Knowing it is upon penalty of death? The great Alec Mason, begging for the life of his heir. I remember many years ago, fighting in the revolution, watching you yield the Nano Forge against the E.D.F... like a god of Old Earth. If Samanya could see you now-- Well, you could ask her. If your men hadn't killed her... a few feet from where-- Marauders did not kill her. Omaya. I have not given you my name to speak. You can have your name back. Just give me my son. I cannot spare the life of one already dead. Alec, open the door. All these years, she was here. With all the anomalistic energy slamming into the crater, it's the perfect hiding space. Satellites would never find it. I want you to stay up here. There's fairly heavy security down there. Can you hack in from up here? Open any locked doors? I think I've proven I can hack into anything from anywhere. But why do I have to stay up here? It's freezing? 'Cause if I don't make it back, someone's going to have warn Eos. You were right. It's more important than my family. Hey! Don't get yourself killed. Lyra. Sergeant! Ivan, wait. I think he might be my brother. I'm never leaving Eos again. Sir. Sir. Sir. You summoned me. We've captured a prisoner. He's from Red Faction. - Do they know of our intent? - No. Lyra believes the prisoner is Jake Mason, her brother. Your brother is dead. I ordered a genome match. It's him. I want an explanation. You want me to tell you again how you came to be with us? Now I want the truth. I was out on patrol. We came across a burnt-out transport. I found you lying next to the wreckage. The transport was full of bodies-- burned bodies-- I assumed your family. But I could not leave you out there, hurt and alone. So I brought you back here, with us. And watched you grow with great pride. Now that's the story you've heard a thousand times. And a thousand times, it's been the truth. I'm sorry I doubted. Is that really what happened? When your father was still alive, he once confided in me that the great burden of leadership... is to always know the truth, no matter how badly you want to believe the lie. Do you want this burden? The truth then, if you please. There was an outbreak of influenza in the compound... that first year after the revolution. Our young were decimated. Population collapse had begun. The only way to survive was to recruit. How many were taken? Lyra was not the only one. Although she was one of the ones specifically targeted. Her father was an enemy of the White Faction. Taking her served two purposes. If repopulating our ranks was one, what was the other? A reckoning, Adam. Alec Mason killed your father. They're gonna kill us, aren't they? Well, if they are E.D.F., maybe they'll go easy on you. Being a fellow Earthman and all. I know that you're kidding, but it's not easy being Earth-born. You know, I have to work twice as hard as everybody else... to prove that this is my home, that I belong to Mars. Tess-- You're as big a pain in the ass as I've ever met. If that doesn't make you a Martian, I don't know what does. Hi. I'm-- I'm sorry. I thought I'd have something better to say. I was told you were dead. I'm not. Kinda hoping it can stay that way. No one here will hurt you. Well, yeah, except for pretty much kicking my ass. I didn't know it was you. That's okay. We'll call it payback... for that time Mom and Dad took us camping on Mount Le Guin and... I accidently set your sleeve on fire. Barbecued Lyra. Remember? I don't remember them. They remember you. If you were all alive, why didn't you look for me? Dad looked for you... for years. He hasn't been the same since the day you were kidnapped. I wasn't kidnapped. I was rescued. You don't remember what happened? These people you think saved you-- they came into our home. They killed Mom. Right in front of our eyes. I tried to-- I tried to get you to jump with me. And you were so scared. And... I didn't mean to let go. And I'm sorry. - You're lying. - I'm not. Lyra-- Lyra, listen to me. Lyra, you have to listen! Lyra! Lyra. Are you all right? I'm fine. I won't let him be harmed. I know. Look, this is a lot to process. Me too. To discover after all this time you have a family. You're my family. We have to get out of here. I fully support that course of action. How? - Take your shirt off. - What? - Take your shirt off. - Why? Get a guard's attention. He will come in, see you, be distracted. - Maybe I get the jump on him. - No! Tess, if it makes you feel any better, there aren't anyone's breasts on this planet that I want to see less. It does not make me feel better. On many levels. Tess! Okay? Okay. Okay! Turn around. Okay? Okay, I'm ready. Okay. Hey! I need some help in here, please! Hey! Somebody, please! Somebody better come kill you soon. Nice. Thanks. Oh! Uncle, I-I do not-- A mortal debt is a mortal debt. Commander Hale. What is it? Mason has escaped. We're on our way. Where is he? You gonna make this easy? You gonna make this hard? Ah! Ah! No, no, no, no, no, no, no! Not this one! Not this one! Jake! Tell me you have a way out of here. Lyra. Lyra! Come on. Come on! He's gone. You all right? How did he escape? He had help. Did he? If he warns Red Faction or the Marauders of our true intentions, a generation of planning and suffering will have-- will have been for nothing. Then there's no further reason to delay. We need to accelerate the plan. Activate the firework. Look. What is it? That's why they needed the firework from the Hydra. The E.D.F. fortress. It's a dreadnought. And it's headed straight for Eos. The dreadnought's jamming communication. I'm gonna have to drop you guys off somewhere, get back to Eos, warn them. Leo, take over. Yeah. Hurry. Cannot fly the ship and keep pressure on her wound. She will die. You're not gonna be very welcome in Eos. We're not very welcome anywhere. Railgun locked on Eos. Satellite still can't detect us. Multiple hits, sir. Railgun powering down. How many dead? As many as it takes. We have drawn first blood. Red Faction will believe it was Marauders who attacked them. We're too late. This way! Right there. No! No, no. No, no. What is going on in Eos? Our satellites show weapons discharge. How could a people so sanctimoniously steeped in honor... kill innocent civilians from a comfortable distance? This ammunition was found in the rubble. It bears Marauder markings. You haven't simply abandoned society. You've abandoned all pretense of humanity. We did not attack you. I know, Matriarch. It was the E.D.F. We drove them from the surface of Mars long before you were born. - Not all of them. - Get that man out of here. Wait. Your face-- I see your foremother in it. You still live, Jake Mason, son of the traitor. Now I wouldn't be surprised if you had arranged this attack yourselves... to whet your people's appetite for battle. You may have struck first, but we will strike harder. You will launch an air offensive against the Marauders within the hour. - You can't do that. - And you will arrest this man. - On what charge? - Desertion. Consorting with the enemy. Treason. And war crimes. Speaker Ludlum, I don't think it's necessary-- You do not think, Major. You follow orders. Dad. Jake. You're alive. Dad, congress is declaring war on the Marauders. You need to talk to Ben, get him to stop the attack. Why would I do that? The E.D.F.-- some of them survived the revolution. They didn't have the numbers to take on both Marauders and Colonists. But if they can trick us into going to war with each other, we conquer ourselves. They're the ones. They killed Mom and kidnapped Lyra. I found her, Dad. I found Lyra. If you found her, why didn't you bring her back home? Because we're not her home anymore. This is insane. You know, as much as you blame me... for leaving her behind, you left me behind too! If you could stop hating me for just one second, maybe we could get her back. You, uh, Colonists don't make very good cages, do you? Are you coming? Go. Go, go. Want me to drive? Want me to kick your ass? What's the plan? The shuttle's equipped with thermobaric missiles. We rescue Lyra from the dreadnought, we blow it straight to hell. Where to you think the dreadnought is now? Bakhuysen Trench. None of our satellites scan there. Marauders would never know what hit them. Just like Eos. We're within firing distance of the Marauders' Palace. - Bring the railgun to 100%. Railgun charging. To bring them peace... we must bring them war. Man, that's big. Give us 10 minutes to find Lyra. After that, light her up, whether we're back or not. Railgun at 25% and rising. We have a hard target lock on the Marauder Palace. Railgun at 45%. Telemetry nominal. Intruder alert, Sector 7. Intruder alert, Sector 7. It's Mason! Lyra's quarters. Intruder alert, Sector 7. They know. She's been aiding them all along. They know everything. You let him back on this ship. You betrayed us. Lyra's room is down this way. Cover my back. Until we leave Mars. Love how you guys say "die." How many do you want? All of them. Lyra! Get away from him. - No. - You can't leave. Yes, I can. And you can come with me. As what? A Colonist slave? I am Adam Hale. And I will not run from my destiny. Our destinies were stolen. Adam-- We were gonna build a new world. A new Mars. Together. Everything has been a lie. We weren't. Come with me. Lyra! Dad, we are ready for that ride. Let's go. Let's get to a safe distance, launch the missiles. Hang on. Watch it, watch it, watch it, watch it. Yeah, I got it. Dad, more inbound. - You got a lock. You got a lock. - All right. Brace for impact! Everyone okay back there? Compared to what? I'm fine. Last time I saw you, you were... smaller. Go. The railgun is at 62% and climbing. Uh, realign the railgun five degrees south. - Sir? - Do it! Sir, that's the Bakhuysen Terraformer. It generates the atmosphere surrounding Eos and the Marauder Nation. If we destroy this, this whole section of Mars will be-- Uninhabitable. The atmosphere will be torn apart. Do it. They're retargeting the railgun. They're aiming southwest. What-- What's in that direction? The terraformer. Jake! Tess? Tess, you're okay? I re-tasked our satellites and I found the dreadnought. It was in the Bakhuysen Trench. Red Faction is calling off the attack on the Marauders. No. No, no, no, no, no. You need to get the fleet out of here now, Tess. Hale is targeting the terraformer. Jake, I can't. They're way too far out. They'll never get back in time. Look, the shuttle's damaged. I can't fire the missiles. You don't happen to still have a good old ship, do you? Maybe. Why? Okay. If you destabilize the engines and crash the ship into the dreadnought-- Turn the shuttle into a bomb. I know you know where that eject switch is, Jake. Make sure you use it. After I lock the stick, I'll bail out at about 200 meters. Hopefully that'll be far enough to clear me from the ex-- Dad, what are you doing? What are you doing? Dad! Hey, Dad? Dad, you don't have to do this. The ship's reactor was damaged in the crash. It'll go nuclear on impact. Dad, you-- you don't have to do this. You can get out in time. You can bail out. If someone's on the stick, the shuttle won't hit the target in one piece. Railgun is at 95%. It's my turn. One last swing of the hammer. Dad, please. You know, I told you that you reminded me a lot of me. That's not the truth. Truth is, Son, you're a better man than I ever was. You were able to help me fulfill a promise I made to your mother... that I was never able to keep. Brought your sister back. Thank you, Son. Thank you. Lyra, can you hear me? Yes. You're as-- You're as beautiful as your mother. I love you. You're home now, sweetheart. You're home. I never thought I would see the day... when I would set foot in Eos. Nor I the day I would welcome you to it. Your father's sacrifice will not be forgotten. He was a good man. He was. Lieutenant Mason has a proposition for us. The old Mars... is gone. My father ended that world. And we... need to create a new one. A world where we use our differences, our knowledge and-- and our faith... to keep our people safe. What do you propose? First step-- a new faction... comprised of both Marauders and Colonists. A force empowered to protect both of our nations. A unit which could show that... maybe, in the end, no matter which tribe we belong to, we are all Martians. There will be resistance to this idea. I am not certain any of my warriors will be so-- Is it your wish to join Red Faction, Leonid? There is no place for me in your world. A place could be made. I will never be what you want, Mother. You fought bravely. You've learned the lesson of the wandering. Come home. What my wandering taught me is that... I need to join this new faction. Want... and need... are two very different things, Leonid. Very well. On an occasion like this, it is custom to exchange gifts. This belonged to my mother. I will kill someone you hate with this. That... sounds great. Jake. Hey. So, we're starting a new Red Faction. Mm-hmm. I want to sign up. - No. - Excuse me? I'm just not sure I'm comfortable having someone like you on the team.
