Oh my God! Bobbie! Oh shit! Fucking no! Oh my God! Oh God baby, what happened to you? I'm gonna get my Uncle Mel, he used to be a medic. Got guys through combat and shit. You're going to be okay, Kid. Your old uncle Mel is here. Just kick back. I don't have any morphine... but this is some of the best smack around. If this don't kill the pain... nothing will. - You're a doctor, Melvin? - Yeah. Yeah, I'm a doctor shooting you up with heroin. That's right. No kid, I'm just a... I'm just a junkie and a real good thief. They kind of go together. That's it, pal. Beginning of story. End of story. There you go, ba-da-bing! What I wouldn't give for veins like that. And don't you ever call me Melvin again, you little shit. Thanks, Mel. Hey, you keep a real nice house, ever hear of a trash can? Okay so, here is the deal. What are you doing? Hey. - Put that down. - Chill out, man. Chill out? Put it fucking down. Are you fucking joking? Bobbie, you look like shit. The cops are after ya'. I mean you're hotter than a freshly fucked fox in a forest fire. Okay? Now I iced your nasty little ass down. I stopped most of your internal bleeding. I put ice packs on your tiny little head so maybe the brain damage won't be too bad. Gave you my best dope. And I have spent two fuckin' days in a shit hole I would not send my worst enemy into. Okay? Making sure you don't go into a coma. So... Listen to me when I tell you. If you leave here, they are going to bust you. And if you shoot any more speed in the next fucking month, your brain will pop like a fuckin' balloon. - I got to go out for speed, man. - Just listen to me, man. If you walk out the front door of this fucking building... or if you do any more Meth, I will personally break every fuckin' bone in your body that already ain't broken. And I'll kick the shit out of Danny for letting you do it. - Do we understand each other? - Yikes. Yes? We cool? Good. All right. So, princess? Can I trust you to keep these two idiots out of trouble? - Right on, brother. - Right on, baby. Ba-da-bing. See you later. Bye, Mel. I'll fucking kick your ass you little bitch! Fucking give me your shit, you little fucking cunt! Bobbie, I got to piss. Bobbie, I got to piss. Damn, Bobbie. So how do you like my ride, Bobbie? - It's not bad. - Not bad? I betcha' never even been in a Cadillac before, let alone the full glory of a top of the line tricked out Coupe de Ville. Anybody who says crime don't pay only knows guys like you. Fuck you, mother fucker. I'm not some little kid. I just made seven-eight hundred bucks in one night. Yeah, in fucking quarters. Probably got a hernia draggin' them home. - Shit son. - Hey, I ain't your son, and I got the fucking quarters home. You damn near got killed doing it, right? I got this stealing thing wired. I don't need shit from you. - How old are you? - Old enough. Why don't you save the tough guy routine for people you might actually scare. I'm not fucking putting you down. I'm trying to make a point. I don't know how old you are, but I'm going to bet you money you got a driver's license that says you're 18 or 19. And I'll give you 10 to 1 that it's off by 2 or 3 years. You're doing dope all day. Every fucking day and you're stealing with both hands. Here's my point. You think you're a thief. You know what you are? You're a bust waiting to happen. A pro, okay, only steals when he knows everything is in his favor. When he fuckin' knows he's not going to get caught. There's only a few true professionals around, and guess what? They don't do dope. See, eventually the drugs are going to make you fuck up. And voila, you're in the penitentiary. The thing is, for guys like us, you just try to make that run as good and as long as you can, before it's over. Which it will inevitably be. That's my point. - So, how old are you? - Old enough. Fuck, that's right. Good answer. Never plead guilty. Tough guy. How long have you been on your own? Forever. What's the difference? I'm just trying to figure things out. It's how my minds works. Sue me, fuck, Jesus. Are you ready to graduate from screwdrivers and vending machines to some really serious larceny? - Like what? - Like a major score. It's all set up. Why me? You must have tons of guys. I need a guy who's small enough to get up into a cramped space and hide there for nine or ten fucking hours and be fucking cool about it. Yeah, why not Danny, he's your blood. Fair question. Danny is my sister's kid. If I got him into the fuckin' life, she will kill my ass. Naw man, you got fuckin' smarts. That's what I like. And you're a tough kid. Tough. How old are you? You're already in the life, kiddo. I hate to say it. You need someone like uncle Mel to show you the ropes. So what do you say? Tell you what. This is going to be a couple of days work, and your end is going to be ten grand, minimum. - Sounds good. - Deal? - Sounds real good to me. - All right. You got it. - So what do I got to do boss? - Okay, first thing. - We leave tomorrow. - All right, yeah. We'll be gone a couple, three weeks maybe. Be fun, all right? Okay, you got it. You figure out what you want to do with your girlfriend, okay? If you want to bring her along, that's fine with me. Oh hey, send Danny down, I gotta get him home. - I'll see you tomorrow. - Hey Ace, hey! Shut the fucking door, it's hot out there. Thanks, man. Maybe he ain't coming. You know he could be fucking with you, baby. Naw baby, Mel is for real. He is just coming late, that is all. All right, babe? All right baby, whatever you say. You are the boss. He sure is late. He is not that late. All right here he comes. This better be him. Hey, how is it going? Hey, Ace. Jeez-Louise, they are fucking babies. Stop it! You two are Bonnie and Clyde? So are we. I love desperados. I do, don't I? We are going to have a really good time. My name is Sidney. But you can call me Sid. - Hi. - Hi. Now my dimwitted friend over here... has what you call, poor impulse control. Aye-yi yi-yi. Cock-suckers never eat hair pie. Now wait a minute, let me guess. That is your luggage, right? Which probably means you have jeans and a tee-shirt? Which means that we are going to have to go shopping. - We dropped the best acid... - Shut up. I'm going to take you guys shopping. I think you need a whole new wardrobe. I need a whole new wardrobe. That is for sure. You got a wardrobe for ten people. Melvin being the absent minded professor type that he is, he also forgot to mention that you both are absolutely fucking starving to death. Jesus Christ you schmuck, look at them, they are bones. - Bones... - Poor babies. Let's get these guys something to eat before they just blow out the window like fucking leaves. - What do you say? - Fine. They do look like death eaten on a cracker, don't they? We are going on a road trip and we will stop to eat. Because we have road trip boogaloo. - Boogaloo. - Road trip boogaloo. Aye-yi yi-yi Your grandmother swims after troop ships. Drive the car, Melvin. Did you like this tongue this morning? - You guys on acid? - How long is this tongue? Is this a long tongue? How about this one? Can yours move faster? - Oh my God. - Is that moving fast? Yeah. - Oh come on, don't be rude. - Hey look where you are going. You know, I figure you need concentration. You got to be perfect. You need a nice light touch for this kind of shit. If that current is broken for even like one-tenth of a second, it is all over. That is why they call them contact alarms. See? That wire is live. How long do I got to do this for, man? All day, all night if that's what it takes. Hey, there is no room for error, kid. You fuck up, the alarm goes off. Voila, it is over. - Perfect. - Hey, Henry Higgins... how goes the tutoring? Not bad. The kid has talent. Well you have been working him for hours. Why don't you give him a break? Let's go shopping. Yeah, maybe it is time to take a little break. What do you say? Lead the way, Miss Doolittle. Are you going to wear your crook gloves out? - No. - Good. Hey, not you, princess. We got work to do. - I want you back here at 170O. - We'll be here. Don't have too much fun, okay? Kiss? - Oh, you shocked me. - I shock you every time. Come on. Come on. We're going to take a little drive. Fuck, I hate the suburbs. This is the good shit. Where are we going, Mel? I'm taking you for a drive. - I thought we were working? - We are working. You want to sit at the hotel and play with alarms all afternoon. Shut up and go for a drive. Hey! I would fucking drink her bath water! Did you see that ass? How about Sid, man, she has got the big titties. Three things you never fuck with: You never fuck with a man's money... you never fuck with a man's dope... and you never fuck with a man's pussy. Sorry, man. I never want to get old. You know what Mel says? He says that when he turns sixty... he is going to drive off a cliff. You want a fix? No, I never shoot. I hate needles. Well, give it a little time, my dear and you will come to love needles. So how did you two meet? Who, me and Mel? Oh, let's see. He was selling dope to this schmuck that I was living with. And he kept trying to get me to go out with him behind Charlie's back. That was the name of the guy, Charlie. - You want one of these? - No thanks. I'm addicted to these things. So anyway, when Charlie got busted and I was on my own... I finally said yes to Mel. And the rest is ancient history. Are you guys married? Married, why? Still, it would have been nice to have a big beautiful wedding. I guess. My parents... I haven't spoken to my parents since they found out he's Jewish. It is too bad... because, he is the ideal man. I mean, he is smart, he is rich, he is funny. And he is hung like a horse. I'm a lucky girl. You know the best way to eat pussy? The fucking alphabet. A, B, C, D. - No way. - Try a Z, X, Y, Z. We're here. - What the fuck is this? - A clinic. We are going to rip off some doctor? This no regular doctor. He's the biggest speed doctor in the mid-west. - No way. - Yeah, he's the distributor. He orders from the manufacture and he supplies his own clinics. It goes right through his pharmacy, right here. As you can imagine, this guy does a roaring cash business. He does a bank drop every morning. But he is open Saturdays. So we hit him Saturday night and we get two day's receipts. - All right. - All right. We will keep some of the Desoxins and liquid Meth, okay? Dump the rest wholesale. You get one third, expenses come off the top. Expenses, what expenses? Living expenses Ace. This is a fucking business here, okay? - Holy shit! - Damn. I guess you weren't the only one who went to school today. Look at you, baby. You look great. Thank you. God damn. What is this? I guess the store is closing early or something? No, we hardly did any damage. Besides, we needed something to wear tonight. - Tonight? - What is tonight? We are going out, baby. For a big night on the town. He didn't tell you? We're going out. - Mel, what is going on? - I guess Mel's treating tonight. - How much did all this cost? - A lot. Yeah? How much is a lot? - Come on, Mel. - Okay. - Really, did it cost a lot? - Goodbye, girls. Jimmy. - Hey Mel! - How you doing? Long time no see. Do you think you can get us a booth tonight? I just got to tell you Rose, you look really beautiful. Thank you, Sid. You are a very lucky guy. They are both lucky, lucky they met us. They got good food, good booze. Good music. Now you are living, Ace. I don't know man, this place is a little rough. This fucking place? Hey, I was in a Blues Bar in St. Louis. A guy walks in carrying a severed head. Walks up, sets it on the bar. And says, give the bitch a beer. - That is a true story. - No way! I'm fucking serious as a heart attack. That is a true story. You live in the fast lane, Mel. I do. We're certainly glad to have everyone here tonight. Is everyone feeling all right? Are you all feeling good? Listen, I'm telling you true. I got to have somebody to scratch my back tonight. If you want to hear Clarence Carter scream, you just have somebody scratch my back. In fact, what I think I'll do is play a little song, so you'll understand what I'm talking about. A little song called, "I'm Looking for a Fox." It goes something like this. - Dance? No way. - Come on, Mel. I'm all alone and fancy free But this ain't the way I want to be Get your game up tight We gonna have a wing-ding-do tonight I'm lookin' for a fox Lookin' for a fox Oooh Tonight the sky's the limit I've got my money, and I'm gonna spend it It's Saturday night and I want to play I wanna make love till the break of day I'm lookin' for a fox Lookin' for a fox Oooh I've got a brand new pin stripe suit of clothes I've got a big, wide polka dot tie I got cuff links as big as jay bird eggs Look at this... shoes made out of alligator hide I'm ripe and red and and hot to trot Girl you can get anything I've got I've got the money if you've got the time All you've gotta do is give me a sign I'm lookin' for a fox Lookin' for a fox Oooh I'm lookin' for a fox I've got to have me a fox I'm lookin' for a fox Find me a fox. I don't want you puking on my new suit. Come on. - I love you, Mel. - Yeah? You saved my life. I sure did kid, but let's just stay focused on not puking. I'm the happiest now then I have ever been in my whole life. Before tonight, I never even drank champagne before. You don't say? You might have mentioned that a little earlier in the evening. Oh, yeah? Okay, five feet to heaven. Here we go. Sorry. Sorry. Here, you want to take your shoes off? Guess not. Fine. There you go. You feeling okay? You are not sick are you? You are in bed, good night. Night, night. Thanks, Mel. He could have fit up here. Fuck. Bingo. Easy as fucking cake. Did I scare you, baby? Lead the way, boss. We're rich! We are so fucking rich! Still got to sell this shit, Ace. Knock, knock. Bobby, this is Reverend James Cook. Today, I can offer you the worldly protection... of the weapons of the hand. You are a gun dealer? I'm a gunsmith by trade. But a fisher of men by avocation. But you are a preacher. Doesn't that go against your morals? Even Jesus Christ was a carpenter. And his disciples, fisherman. And we know blessed Mary Magdalene was a whore. Boys, I hate to break up the theological discussion here... but how much for the lot, Jim? Two thousand total. I prefer 10O's. And now... May God bless you... and keep you safe under his protection... for all your earthly endeavors. Softly and tenderly Jesus is calling Calling for you And for me. Happy trails. Who the fuck was that? Somebody you never want to mess with. Got you first. Hey baby. Kind of pretty for something so ugly? I'm pregnant, Bobby, what do you think about that? I have been trying to tell you for awhile you know, but I didn't know how to say it. Come on baby, don't just stand there all peeing and shit. Say something. This is serious. - What are you going to do? - I don't know. What if I want to keep it? Shit baby, you think that is a good idea? I mean, fuck, I ain't old enough to handle kids. Oh I see, you are just a kid, right? One minute you are Mister Big Man with Mel... and the next minute you're just a helpless little boy. - Is that it? - No, that is not what I meant. I'm just saying maybe we should wait... wait until all this shit is over, you know? Wait til it is a good time to have kids. There never will be a good time, there will always be something wrong. If I keep it, are you going to leave? I don't know baby... I never even thought about having kids before. Seeing how my parents fucked me up and all. Yeah well, our parents didn't give a fucking shit about us. So fuck them! But we can do better. We can be the kind of parents that they never were. You are the best thing that ever happened to me, baby. I love you. But I'll do this alone if I have to. Shit baby, you know me better than that. The only way you are going to get rid of me is if I die. And I am not going to fucking die, okay? Oh good. Besides I'll spoil the shit out of him, right? Or her. - Hey have you told Sid yet? - No. Oh my God! Oh my God. You're pregnant. Oh my God. Oh my God. They are pregnant. You're pregnant. You are going to have a baby. You're going to have a little baby. A beautiful little baby. Oh my God, I can't fucking believe it! All right. Calm down. Great news. But, everybody in the world doesn't have to hear it. What do you mean, everybody doesn't need to know. What, am I being loud, is that what you mean? I mean, who gives a flying fuck really? It is so cool, I can't believe it. A baby, now wait a minute, how pregnant are you? When are you going to have this baby? What do you want? - A girl. - A boy. Your eyes, and your mouth. Oh my God. Little babies, I love little babies. No more caffeine for you, missy. For me? It is for her. I think you are a bit more excited about this than we are. You think? No... well you will get more excited. No, we are excited. Oh, I love kids. What the fuck are you doing? What am I doing? Yeah, what are you doing? I'm not doing anything. What is your fucking problem? Don't... do this. Fuck you, Mel. So there are some details I want to go over at the motel, before the clients start coming, okay? Whatever you say man, you are the boss. Should you be smoking? The baby? - So which one do you like? - Well, the.38 Smith and Wesson. It is a Chief's Special. It is compact, plenty of stopping power with these hollow points. I got it all sighted in on the range. Accurate to fifty feet. Oh gosh, that's nice. Pay attention, G.I. Joe. If you want to learn, you got to listen. - I'm listening. - Put the gun down and watch. I'm listening. Put the fucking gun down before I smack the shit out of you. Come here. A Walther PP. I call it a lucky seven, because it has got six in the clip and... one in the chamber. Let me see your hands. See you got delicate hands and not a lot of muscle. - Fuck you. - No man. This is good for you. It has good balance. How does it feel? - Oh, it feels good. - Yeah? - I like it. - Good? See, Sid and me will teach you how to shoot. Now here's the deal. You make a gun feel like it's an extension of your arm. And after a little practice you don't have to aim. You just point your hand at what you want to hit and boom. It will fucking have holes in it all day. I'd like to see some fucker try some shit on me with this. Finish his ass like Swiss cheese. Hey, something you got to understand Ace, all right? A gun is there for your protection. You use it when you have no other option. It ain't your fucking dick so don't be whipping it out every time you want to prove you are a fucking tough guy. Okay? You got that? Yeah man, I ain't stupid. Glad to hear it. Thanks. Hey, Mel. What you think about me being a dad? Pretty crazy? I think you are pretty young to be popping out babies. But hey, it ain't my business. Rosie is really excited, but I'm nervous. I guess that is normal? Me and Sid can't do it. Can't have no babies. So do me a favor and go light on the topic. Fuck it. Just the luck of the draw. You and Sid have really been like parents to me and Rosie. So I kind of guess you got kids after all. Even if it is not the way you expect, right? Give me a break, kid. You think if I was going to adopt, I would end up with a delinquent doper like you? I don't think so. I'm just fucking with you. Don't be so sensitive. Don't worry, Bobbie. Everything's going to work out. You think so? Yeah, I do. Yeah? Send him over. First clients have arrived. So what will I do? Just hang there, look cool. How about fifty cents each? No way pal, no. Sixty cents, that is it. Or we don't do business. Black Beauties are selling for two, three dollars a piece on the street. Twenty-five hundred dollars. Cash money, right now. Or we walk... fucker. We'll find a better price. It is just as simple as that. Sixty cents, or we don't have a deal. It is as simple as that. Fucker! Who has the money? Take it out. Let me see it. Let me see it. Put it on the bed. My partner's going to count it. If it's all there, you get your Black Beauties. You hit the road and everything is cool. If it comes up short... I'm just going to take all your fucking money. And you can suck my dick. Okay... fucker? No. It is all here, three G's. Perfect. Watch this. Five thousand Biphetamines. It is as simple as that. Ha! Just fucking with you fellas. What, are you from California of something? Like a surfer? Like a Big Kahuna? Yeah. You in a band or something? What? Don't worry boys, it's all there. Your mommy's and daddy's money is well spent. Go on beat it. Kahuna hit the fucking big waves, baby. Bye. - Fucker. - Who do you think you are? - Fast Draw McGraw? - What, what did I do? Hey, the fucking guy was trying to set the price. That is my job. Okay, that's my fuckin' gig. And he looked pretty mean, that guy. Barry? He was like a mean looking guy, wasn't he? - I was scared. - Scared shitless. Fuck, I was shivering, quaking in my boots. Oh my God, did you see his shirt? - Oh my God. - Oh baby. You know, you are a forty-year-old who acts like a kid. And you are a kid, shit, who acts like a forty-year-old. Hey, you know what I am, I'm a fucking forty-year-old. - Yeah, I know. - Okay, so I act like a kid. But I fuck like a kid too, okay, baby? Yeah, that is true. I'm a kid who fucks like a forty-year-old. - Sid, come on back, Sid. - Sid, thanks for sharing all that. - Yeah, thanks. - Thanks for over-sharing. - I think she likes me? - No. Hey, why can't you fucking shoot it like everybody else? You know your needle-phobia is wasting a lot of my good smack. What is your problem, man? We got so much shit we are giving it away. Oh I guess I'm just a little tense about our next deal. The fucking guys call themselves Hitler's Henchmen. They are like a bike gang that don't require bikes. Go figure. Sid don't want to have anything to do with 'em. But man, they want so much fucking volume. I don't give a shit what they call themselves, man. As long as they got a lot of dough. Sid doesn't like 'em? Oh, she has been on my ass about it all fucking day. Yack, yack, yack, yack, yack. It is like, fuck it. You know? I mean I'm the one who lost relatives in the war. Don't bother me none. Grudge shopping? Whatever. Mel? What! I don't want to get near these cock-suckers. Fine, okay. So who's going to bring the shit over when we make the deal? I will. I'll bring the shit over. Great. Okay. - Let me know when it arrives. - Yeah, fine. - Wait. - What? Give me that. Thank you. What the fuck, man! Are they on the rag or what? Not my girl. Well mine is on the rag or both of them. Look at this. - That was pathetic. - Where is the rest of our shit? - Rosie took it over. - So I have nothing? Great. Everybody is fucking high but me. You know we do our own cookin'. Make crystal so good it looks like glass. - Ain't that right, Ty? - Yeah, we do. So if your crank is so good, how come you want these ups? Well not everybody likes crank, pal. Some people like pills. After we get done selling these ups, twenty-five G's turns into a hundred. That's why "big-time." Make the call. Fifty thousand beans. All right then. Say, have you ever heard this one? If the "Flintstones" was black, what would they call the show? "The Niggers." What, you don't think that's funny? Hey, I got one... How do you circumcise a redneck? I don't know. Kick his sister in the chin. What the fuck! You see? You can't never be too cautious. Fuck! Spinner here came up from nextdoor. The rest of the stash... probably there with the Jew-boy's bitch guarding it! Hey! Hey! Hey! Ty and me will stay here. You two go get the cunt and our stash! Listen boss, you got the best hand! Why don't you just let the chicks go? Let me just get the kid to the hospital. I got fifty G's stashed. Melvin, do you know how you get a hundred Jews into a Mercedes Benz? In the ashtray. How do you like me now, mother fucker? Jew-boy's bitch? Melvin! Shit! Fuck! Are they dead? - No? - Yes, no? Are you all right? Are you all right, Bobbie? Get up, get up. Shit! We have to get you to a hospital. Bobbie, get the dope. Go get the car. Get the car, Rosie! Now! - Get the money! - No, get the dope! - Get the fucking money! - All right, get the money! Come on, we have to get out of here. No Mel, he will get the money, honey. Come on, get up. Mel, let him get the money and get up! Bobbie, you okay man, you fucked up? Come on I can't pick you up, help me! Okay, okay, okay. I can't hold you, come on, stand up. Damn it! Bobbie, are you hit? Are you hit? - Oh shit! - We're going to the hospital. - No we are not! - We got to get you to a doctor! And the kid needs a real doctor! If we go anywhere near a hospital in the five-state area, we're fucking busted! The reverend's the only chance we got! He has a whole crew working. So we go to Jim-Bo's which is only three hours away. Oh God. Fuck it! I should have gone to Veterinary School. I was going to be a fucking vet, you know that? - I was going to be a vet. - Who the fuck cares man! I thought it was bullshit, sticking my fucking finger up a poodle's ass! You are really sick. Oh fuck me. I think I'm fucked up. I'm fucked up. It was a funny joke about the "Flintstones." How can you laugh like that? Doesn't it hurt? Yeah, it fucking hurts, but only when I laugh. Oh my God. We need to see the reverend. Go on down to the house. Careful. You are home now, boy. Ain't nobody going to hurt you. Don't be moving around. You have to lay still. You were mighty bad when you came in, but you are improving by the minute. Only kidding. He has helped a lot of folks. Oh slow it down there, boy. Hey there. I kind of like you this way... crazy. You know they got goats here. Cows, chickens, rabbits. I lost it. Buy hey, don't worry about me, I'm cool. What would we do with a baby anyway? Don't think, okay? Just rest. I'll come back later and give you a blow-job. Yikes. - Do it again? - Yeah. Oh that is good. Look, I got hair on my toes. When did I get that? I didn't have that before I met you guys. - You need a pedicure. - You want to give me a pedicure? Sure I'll give you a pedicure. I have to try this. - Want a drag? - No thanks. So what you doing with this Mel fool anyway? - With this Mel fool? - Yeah. Oh man, I can't wait to get out of here. Fucking middle of nowhere. All this... Space! Makes me nervous, man. Give me, high rises, traffic, smog. Fucking anything but all this God damn... nowhere, nothing, shit! I hear you, man. - I got this friend, Jewels. - Yeah? He has some vault thing going. It sounds pretty good. What do you mean? I mean we got a job. We are out of here tomorrow. What? I just thought, you know, we were going to lay low. - Take it easy. - Take it easy? What are you, some kind of fucking old man now? Naw. Just thought we were going to play it cool, that is all. You know, relax. Well... I changed my mind. - It is a lot of money, Bobbie. - We got money. We got half our money. Those ups we got left aren't worth shit now. How about the cops? Aren't they looking for us? You let me worry about that, all right? - Shit, Mel. - What is the deal? Why you sweating this so much? I'm not sweating anything, Mel. I'm just, fuck! Rosie lost the baby! You fucking almost got killed. Hey, it's part of the territory. If you don't like the risk maybe you should change professions. Busboy. Milkman... Bum. Jesus! Fuck man! See, you just don't get it. You fucking don't get it, you little shit! This is about money! Money! We hit this, we are set for life. You and that little twat will have it made in the shade. And you ain't even twenty yet. Think about that. Think about it! I don't know about you... but I ain't quitting until I get what I came for. Understand me? Anything else... Listen to me! Anything else is a compromise. And compromise is for losers. Fucking, fucking, nobodies! Don't tell me I don't get it. It's the booze talking, son. It's the fucking booze. This is something I need you on. It is about trust, okay? I haven't steered you wrong yet, have I? Have I? We have to stick together. Right? Bobbie. - Yeah. - All right. Rosie, are you sleeping? No, just resting. I brought you some chicken soup. You need something in your tummy. I'm not very hungry. You can eat it later. Oh my God, every time I look in the mirror these days I feel like it is going to crack. I wish there was something I could do for you. There's nothing you can do. I know, that is what kills me. Little baby, don't say a word Mama's gonna to buy you a mockingbird If that mockingbird don't sing Mama's gonna to buy you a diamond ring. Talk to me, Rosie. Tell me what is on your mind. I can't do this. I can't do this anymore, Sid. I didn't think we were gonna to make it. And I feel so guilty. I know. And I was so scared. And I'm still scared. I just don't want to do this shit anymore. I want to go home. I'm so sorry, Rosie. I'm so sorry. God. Listen to me. You don't have to do anything you don't want to do. Do you hear me? Nobody is going to make you do anything. I promise. Okay. What have we gotten you kids into. There's something else I've been thinking about since we got here. What is on your mind, darling? I think we should take things back to the way they were before. What do you mean? I mean without the kids. You want to dump... You want to you want to dump Bobbie and Rosie? Well "dump" is a pretty harsh way to put it. But I think we should... give them some money and go our separate ways. Go off on our own again. - I thought you liked 'em? - Yeah I like 'em. They're fine. I love them, they're great. But I mean, what are we going to do? Spend the rest of our lives with two people half our age? We have been doing real good together. They look up to us, they need us, babe. What do they need us for? What do you think we are, Ozzie and Harriet? Oh here we go. Here we go. I'm no role model. I'm a junkie and I'm a thief. So are you. This isn't good for them. We got to let them go. These kids were using and stealing long before they met up with us. Well, that doesn't make it okay. Then what? Okay, I'm not going to argue with you. Especially when you've been drinking. So why don't we just talk about it another time? Okay? They go with us... and I don't want to talk about it again. You know you act tough. But you are not. You're scared. That is why you don't want to let them go. Thanks for telling me we are leaving tomorrow. Get the fuck out of here. Get the fuck out of here. Fuck me. Mingle boys, I have to talk with my hoodlum friends. Hola, Melvin. You got a little glitter here. You got your little bat in here? Nice chickie you have there, what is your pleasure? Give me a whiskey, a double. So what is the score, baby? It is a jewelry store. The guarantee is fifty thousand in uncirculated gold coins. Fucking great, a jewelry store. Steel walls, steel floors... fucking silent alarm. Closed circuit. You fucking brought me here for this? Mira, Mira. It is an insurance score. We make it look real but there is no risk. What's an insurance score? Melvin, this one's still in diapers. The owner puts fifty thousand in the safe, he claims a hundred. Everybody makes out. Where is my fucking drink, man. Hey! - You look like shit. - I'm fine. - So you'll do this? - I just want my fucking drink. - So, it's on for tonight? - Good, okay. So what do you say we go to mi casa, smoke some eska, get naked? What do you think Bobbie, wanna get naked and bump dick heads? Fuck you, Melvin. - Fuck you. - Want to rub the helmet? You never know until you try. I know man, I know. Mel, since when you start running with nios anyway? Since he stopped running with faggots. Hey come on. This is business here. Fucking cool out, will you? Let me tell you something, little chicken. I can kick your ass as good as I can fuck it. Why don't you fucking yell faggots a little louder? Wait here, try not to get eaten while I'm fucking gone. Here's the set up. I got time to study this layout here? Mm-mmm... something nice is looking my way. He looks like a turnip with hair. - Call me before you leave tonight. - I will. Hey, hey... let's make some money, okay? - What is with the attitude? - I don't have an attitude. - I just don't like it. - You don't like it? What does that mean? You told me you only do jobs that are a hundred percent kosher. Yeah. I don't feel a hundred percent kosher. What are you talking about? You heard him. We are in, we are out. No worries. Yeah, it is too fast. We don't even know this guy. Did you fucking hear me? You're like a fucking cunt or something. I've known Jewels since before you were born. I'm not talking about Jewels. I'm talking about the guy we are robbing. Why don't you tell the whole fucking room? It doesn't feel right to me. It doesn't sound right. It doesn't feel right? It doesn't sound right? I decide what fucking sounds right around here. Not you. All right? You didn't know shit before you met me. Now you're going to second- guess my contacts, because you pulled off a couple of chicken-shit jobs? I don't fucking think so. I lead, you fucking follow. You got it? Yeah. Have another drink, Mel. I'm sick and tired of your fucking mouth. - Hear me? - I don't care. - You don't fucking care? - No. You'll care when I throw your fucking ass out in the street. Where would you be without me you little cock-sucker? - I'd be fine! - You would be fucking fine? I don't fucking think so! I don't think you would be fine. You know where you would be? You would be fucking dead! That is where you would fucking be. Right, you hear me? Because this is the last time I'm having this conversation with you. You understand? We are going to do this fucking thing. We are going to make some dough. We are going to get out of here. So just try to be fucking cool! Okay? Hey, hey! What? Fuck, what! Rosie ain't coming, all right. I'm fucking devastated. Rosie's not coming. You think I give a shit? Fine we don't need her. You, me and Sid will do it. Fucking pick up Rosie after. Fine, whatever. Hey. Trust me. Rosie, what are you doing? Hey, baby. Hi. How are you? Thank you, Bobbie. - My protector. - Yeah. What is going on? You never shoot. I know, but me and Uncle Mel... we have been doing a little practicing... during your long recovery. - Yeah? - Hey, Bobbie. - Lets get high together, okay? - I got to work, you know that. Baby, come on. Stay with me tonight. Get high with me. Oh babe, I can't. Not now. Stop it. Come on. Jesus, I can't. I gotta work. Mel's waiting. I gotta work. I don't want you to work. I don't want you to go! Don't go! I don't want to go, too bad. I got to work. No Bobbie, don't leave. Look at you, look at you. You are all fucked up! - So! - So you got to maintain! You can't get this fucked up. All right? I'll be back in a couple of hours. I don't want you to go. I'll be back in a couple of hours. Then I'll fuck you all night long. I don't want you to go. I don't want you to go! Bobbie, don't go, I love you! - Oh fuck! - I love you! I don't want you to go! I love you! - You've got to maintain! - Don't go! Please! Don't be a fucking pig junkie! All right? I love you! - You don't love anything. - No! Fuck you. Give me the big hammer. That is the one. Okay. Punch... and pull. What the fuck? What the fuck is going on? We have been burnt. Let's get the fuck out of here. We'll deal with this later. It was fucking empty. Fucking empty! All right! I didn't say it was you, man! I just fucking... I just fucking got to know where he lives! Okay, all right. No, I'm coming over, all right? Jewels thinks he can find out this guy's address, but it is going to take a few fucking hours. So I'm going over to Jewel's place. I'll drop you guys at the fucking hotel. So we will meet up after I find out where this dead man lives. - I'm out. - No. Don't start your shit! - I'm out! - You are coming with us! - No, I'm not. - Yes. No, no, no! This mother fucking cock-sucker is going down. And you are not going to dare argue with me! Now get in the fucking car, both of you! Sid, we can't do this. God damn it, get in the mother fucking car! I don't want to fucking listen to this fucking bullshit from you every fucking time! I want to be out! Come on Rosie, let's get the fuck out of here. Mel's lost his shit. Come on, we got to go before he gets back. Rosie. Rosie, come on help me pack. Rosie? Rosie. Rosie, baby. Rosie! Wake up! Come on! Please. Wake up. No. Baby you're all I got! Don't do this! No!

Baby, I love you. I love you. Hey Bobbie, come on, will you hurry up! Fuck we have to go. Could you walk any slower? Where's Rosie? - She ain't coming. - The fuck she isn't. Hey, you know we're not coming back here. Once we get our money we are fucking out of here. Okay, so she is either with us, or she is not. - She is not. - What? Hey look, I don't have time for this shit right now! Just get your ass upstairs and bring her down will you? Fuck you, Mel. What did you say to me? What did you just say? She is not coming. Mel, Rosie's not ready. We are late, let's go. What choice do we have? Let's go. Okay, but when I get back here, if she is not ready. I'm going to leave her ass here. Got it? Okay? That is it. Fuck it, you got it? Here we go, right here. Hey Bobbie... come on. Fucking Jewels. You two stay here while I check it out. And don't fucking move until I get back. Bobbie. Wait, Bobbie. You little piece of shit! You look at me when I'm talking to you! Thanks for the fucking backup! You believe this piece of shit pulled a gun on me! If I didn't know better I'd think you were trying to piss me off! Hit him again and I'll kill you! Get the fucking thing off me, this is business! Fuck you, this ain't business, this is bullshit! - Mother fucker, I'll kill you! - Think you are that fast? No, you are not that fast. Hey Bobbie, what is up with the man? This fucker robs us and you put a gun to my head? This is not cool, esse. Why don't you sit the fuck down and shut the fuck up so I don't have to shoot you in the head? Huh, esse? - Bobbie, what are you doing? - Look. Fuck! Shit. Jesus Christ. Come here, hold still. God damn it, hold still! Fuck! My God, why are you doing this to us? - Where is your safe? - We don't have it. Everything that we have is in the safe at the store. - Please. - Oh fuck lady, listen! We have been to the God damn store. We have been in the God damn safe! And you know what we found? Absolutely fucking nothing! Now listen to me! I'm trying to keep you fucking alive. All we want is what is ours. Now if you will take me to the safe, then we will leave. Okay. Fuck! You piece of shit, you lying asshole! Shut up lady, come on! It is obvious to me that this is not your thing. You're a good kid, Bobbie. You just got caught up with the wrong crowd. You probably come from a broken home. Shut the fuck up! Shut the fuck up! - Okay! - Shut the fuck up! - Now! - I'm sorry. Hey chickie, show him you got some balls, go ahead. Don't let him hit me, Bobbie. Please? Thank you. For a fucking idiot... What the fuck do you think you are talking about! Where are the fucking jewels, you mother fucker! I will shoot you in the fucking head! - Son of a bitch! - Jewels! Now! Fucking shit! What the fuck happened? Oh shit! Fuck! Bobbie, what have you done to us? What the fuck have you done! Shit! Fuck! Fuck! Mel, we got to get out of here. Lady, listen to me. In fifteen minutes you call the cops. And you tell them you just shot a burglar. Come on, Mel. Mel, you probably come from a broken family. No Mel. Sorry. God damn it! You didn't have to kill them. - You didn't have to! - I had to! They would have fingered us all. Murder one, Sidney. Life in prison, worse. No, you didn't have to kill them. We got to get out of here. Fuck me. You really fucked it up good this time didn't you, Bobbie? God damn, you really fucking did! Jewels has a huge fucking crew! He's got people everywhere. This is like having a fucking price on our head! - Mel. - No, God damn, no Sid! Stop fucking making excuses for him! God damn it! He fucked us up good! And you fucking know it! What did I ever fucking do to you, you little prick, that you would fuck me like this?! I take you in, I teach you the ropes! I give you my money. My fucking dope! I make you part of my crew! This is my fucking payback?! This is my fucking payback! You shit! - Mel! - You fucking little shit! - Mother fucker! - Shut the fuck up! Shut up! Jesus Christ! Shut up! Come on, everything is cool. Everything is fine! We got the money! We are out of there, we are all right. Oh don't get me fucking started on that! We never should have left him alone in there! Oh God, this whole thing is such a fucking, fucking mess! And now, to top it off, I got to go back to the motel. And pick up his fucking girlfriend, who is too fucking good to work with the rest of us! - She is dead. - What? What did you fucking say to me? What did you fucking say to me! I said she is fucking dead you asshole! So she won't fuck up your perfect plan! Oh my God. Fuck you! - Mel! - Fuck you! Stop it! Oh God! Oh God! Oh God! Oh Bobbie, I'm sorry. You asshole. Shit. I need an enema. Pull over at that gas station. Fill her up. All right, champ. You pull point on potty patrol. Sid, you know what we have to do. You can't be serious. I'm not having a fucking discussion here. We got no choice and you know it. I can't believe you even said that. This is Bobbie. He saved your life, remember? Yeah, I remember. So we are even. This is not about friendship. This is not about love. This is fucking survival. Why don't we just let him go? We can drop him off in Springfield. I can't do that! Look, he is the only one who can finger us. And the only sure way out for him is to cop a plea. We go away for life and he walks. I can't live with those odds. - Mel, no. - I did not create this mess. I am not the one who went apeshit and shot Jewels. Bobbie blew it, you play, you fucking pay. No, you fucking blew it. - What did you say to me? - I'm saying this is your mess. Okay, this plan was a fucked up stupid idea from the beginning. And none of us wanted to do it. I mean you put us all in danger, Mel. Bobbie is our family. Now what do you want to do? You want to put him in a fucking cornfield because you fucked up? - No! - Don't you say another word! One more word, and I swear... I'll put you in the ground right along next to him. Now look... I know that I haven't been as tight as usual. I have been drinking too much. And I'm still fucked up from being shot. But I am clear now. I am clear as a mother fucker. Now we got about eighty grand back there, we got this one small problem to take care of now. And I will deal with Jewels' crew later. Everything is going to be cool. I got it all worked out, okay? So... We'll do this tonight. The sooner, the better. Once it is dark, you are going to pull over to a cornfield... to take a piss. And I'll take care of everything. All you got to do is help with the body. - Okay. - All right then. So you get in there and buy us a fucking shovel. Bobbie? Bobbie. Sid, I love you but I can't do this anymore. I was going to leave this morning with Rosie. Bobbie, I have about ten seconds. Here, take this and get the fuck out of here. No, I don't want your money, I just want to get dropped off somewhere so I can fucking figure out my life. I'm going to go tell Mel now. No, you can't go back in the car. Listen to me, Mel is going to kill you. Run, okay? Go fast. Here's your fucking shovel. So where the fuck is Bobbie? Far away from here by now. Fuck! Mind your own business.
