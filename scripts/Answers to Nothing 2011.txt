His chute was damaged by enemy fire, and he lost control and landed on the roof of a house in the middle of the country. I guess he got injured somehow, I think from the hard landing from the hole in his chute. Anyway, the man that lived in the house had a beautiful young daughter who nursed him back to health. And after a few days, he left to rejoin his unit, but not before telling her that he would be back for her. Eight months later, he returned... and he's been with my grandmother ever since. Beautiful story, huh? Romantic, right? Yeah, romantic. He said that he would be here. I... I told him this morning. Well, why don't you give him a call again? I'll handle another patient, and I'm sure he'll be here when I come back. Oh, my God! You're unfucking believable. I'm gonna come so fucking hard. Oh, God! Fuck! Oh, my God, yeah! Don't... Don't... Don't... Don't swallow it. Hmm? Don't swallow it. No, don't... don't spit it out. Spit it in here, baby. You turn me on. I gotta go. Early this morning, local volunteers gathered to work with police in combing a huge area down by the shipyards for any signs of But later in the day, police once again found themselves reaching out to the public for help in this unsettling case. We believe the perpetrator snuck into the bedroom window and took her while the family was asleep. Detective, one more question, please. You've been questioning a neighbor by the name of Roger Beckworth. Is he a suspect? No. I already told you Mr. Beckworth is merely a person of interest. Now, that's all I have for you today. All I ask is that if anybody sees Christie Dillon or knows anything about her whereabouts, to please contact 911 so we can get her back here where she belongs, at home with her family. Thank you. Detective, I just need to know... is there any other suspect? Frankie... so you still want to keep two black-and-whites in front of the house? Yeah, and, uh... keep the reporters off the damn lawn, okay? Right. Right. All right, Barbara Walters, that's enough. Let's go. Off the lawn. I got here as soon as I could. I'm so sorry. I got caught up with a new client. I called your cell phone. I know. The battery's dead. I forgot to charge it. Why are you crying? You're 40 minutes late, Ryan! I know. I... I got stuck with a client. I... I told you I'm sorry, but I'm here now, a-and we're here now. You did it already? In the car. In the parking lot. In the parking lot? Yeah. You know I get nervous in doctors' offices. I just wanted to make sure that I had a good sample. Ah, Ryan, you made it. Yes. - And I see you have your sample already. - I do. Well, let's get started. We're praying for you. Thank you. - You okay? - Yeah, I'm good. Good. Well, that's good. Still getting your weekly tests, right? Good, 'cause your parents aren't backing down. They want him, and they're gonna say that you're not fit to care for him. They want him in a home. He doesn't want to go there. Well, we've done everything that we can to establish that you're a responsible caregiver, so who... uh, who's assigned to us for this? Michael Ambrose. He's fair. He's gonna listen to us, and that's really all that you can ask for in a mediator. I know it sounds really cold. Are you okay? Yeah. Why don't I come over to your place the night before? We'll prepare. Okay... I hate... being obligated to talk to people just because it's polite. I hate... people who say that money doesn't matter, because it does. I hate laugh tracks. I hate people who don't think that there are two Americas. I hate when you bite into an onion ring and the onion comes out, but then you're left with this fried bread tube thing. I hate how I always think that I have a booger hanging out of my nose, and I'm constantly trying not to touch my nose so that... I just... I always feel like there's a booger that's there, that's dangling there when I'm talking to people, and... I hate it. I hate people who don't use pictures of themselves on Facebook. MIX DID YOU LOSE THIS DOG'? Uh, sorry. I, um... I think I hit something over here! Found her bed empty and the screen on her window removed Right now, neither of her parents are considered suspects by the authorities, but there is some interest being paid to a neighbor. Thanks, Leslie. Prepare for the heat wave to contin... Ready to go, buddy? One of us has gotta lose some weight. And Paris Hilton. I fucking hate that bitch. And... And hairy moles on people's faces. You know, I just want to grab that catfish whisker and just rip it right off of their chin. Jesus Christ. And rotator cuffs. I hate them. I tore mine three years ago, and it still hurts. And I hate... I hate black people. I hate the way that they talk in movies. I mean, it's got to bug the shit out of you, too, right? Hey, what time do you guys want to practice tonight? I thought you guys were DJing at Jones tonight. Nah, it's tomorrow. I got plans. That old married guy tonight? He's not that old. But he is that married. Man, from here, he just seems like somebody's dad. I got a feeling he's a little bit more than just that. - Mr. Beckworth. - Hi. I'm Detective Frankie Graylin. I know. I've seen you on TV. Great. So let's, uh, talk about why you're here. Right. As you know, with your permission, we searched your truck, and we found a strand of hair that belonged to Christie Dillon. Right. I know you already gave an explanation, but I'd like to hear it again. Okay... About, um... three weeks ago, I went to the park at the end of my street to eat my lunch, and I saw Christie there with one of her friends. I think her name was Heather. And, anyway, Christie was, uh, sort of helping, uh, support, carry Heather, who's limping. Christie looked, uh, a little overwhelmed 'cause they had a couple of bikes with 'em. And where were you? On a bench? No, no, no. I was... I was eating my lunch in my truck, you know, facing the softball field. Okay... So, you know, I got out of my truck, and, uh, you know, I asked Christie if she, you know, needed some help. And you know her? Knew her? Oh, sure, yeah. No, I've known Christie and her family since Christie was little. You know, I've been over their house you know, to a holiday party a couple times. We do a big block party on the Fourth of July. It's a great neighborhood. - I get it. - Good. Right. Okay. So, uh, it turns out that Christie's friend, uh, her ankle was banged up pretty bad from falling off her bike, so, uh, I loaded their bikes in the back of my truck, and I took the girls back to Christie's house. And had Christie ever been in your truck before? Uh, no. No, that was the first and, uh, the only time. Oh. Ls there a... Are you currently in a relationship or... No, I'm not. Uh, you know, my wife and I, you know, we got divorced, like, 15 years ago, and, uh, you know, I've had a couple of relationships on and off since then, but nothing too serious the last year or so, so... How about you? A-Are you seeing anybody, Frankie? No, I'm currently not in a relationship. Well, uh... This is probably really inappropriate, but, you know, after all this, you know, blows over, I mean, when you guys find Christie, maybe you and I, we could... we could have dinner or, you know, we could... Wow, that was inappropriate. Yes, it was very inappropriate. I'm sorry. It's... I'm sorry. It's you're very attractive. That was dumb. It was dumb. - Look, it's... - No, it was dumb. - Sorry. I'm sorry. Sorry. Sorry. - It's okay. Okay... It's all right. Oh, God. You know, actually I-I'm very flattered, - but let's just leave it alone. - Okay. All right. Uh, I think we're done here for today. Uh, can I... Am I done? Yes. I will send somebody in with your release papers. - Sorry. - It's all right. Oh, God. Ah, fuck. You know how fast you were going? No. I'm sorry, officer. I thought I was going the speed limit. No. You were going 39 in a 25-mile-per-hour zone. License and registration, please? Right. Okay... You startled me. That was so quick. Well, I... I didn't mean to scare you. Look, this is... this is the end of a school zone here, you know, which means that there are a lot of kids around, playing, you know. Sometimes they don't pay much attention to traffic. You know, they might just jump right out from behind a parked car to chase down an overthrown football or something, and, the speed you're going, you're not... you're not gonna have time to... to brake. You know, so... So just, you know, for everyone's sake, slow down next time, okay? You're not gonna give me a ticket? Thank you. Thank you so much, officer. I will totally be more careful from now on. Okay... You have a good day. Thank you. You, too. Hey, Mrs. Harrison. Oh, Jerry, honey, I got something for you. Um, how've you been? Oh, I'm good. I'm good. Here. That's homemade brisket with mashed potatoes and green beans. You look like you don't eat, so I made you a plate. Oh, you didn't have to. It's... Of course I did. It's not every day you graduate from the police academy. Oh, I'd have brought it a couple of weeks ago, but I haven't been feeling well, and I didn't want to take... No, no, don't worry about that. It's... It's very, very sweet of you. Thank you very much. - Hi, Mrs. Harrison. - Oh. Carter. Hey. You know, you may want to add a little salt to that, because I use lemon juice instead of salt. Police are still refusing to refer to Mr. Beckworth as a suspect, but public pressure may force them to do that soon. In Hawthorne today, an elderly man... Dude, where you been? Raid starts in three minutes. Sorry. Parent-teacher meeting. God, and... he ate the whole thing. - After he said it was- - Yes. Oh, no. Oh, my God, thank you. Thank you. I have not laughed like that in months. Oh, how's Ryan? Great. And everything else? Well, we're gonna do in vitro this week. - That's great. - Yep. And, uh, Ryan's been very supportive, uh, but it's a... it's a process. Um, it's just we're both very committed to it, which makes it easier... normal. Hey, look who's on TV. You think he's guilty? I know he is. I mean, she's like Tina's age. I mean, this fucking job, it's like a looking glass into the soul of this world. I mean, it's scary raising kids here. We have to lie to them about everything. There's so many bad things, bad people, and sometimes I wonder why we try so hard when we're so clearly outnumbered. Oh, you know, I'm... I'm sorry. I don't mean to... - No. - It's... No, it's fine. Drink. - Yes. - Cheers. Here's to pain. Hey. Hey. Still outwith Frankie? Yeah. I'm just about finished, though. - Great. Tell her hello for me. - Okay. See you at home in an hour? Hello? Ryan, are you there? Yeah. Yeah, uh... I lost you for a second. What'd you say? I said I will meet you at home in an hour. Okay? Might be a little bit later. I got to swing by Mom's. Oh, um, okay. Um, I'll see you after. I'll see you in a bit. I love you. Me, too. Okay, 10 miles. How do you feel? I feel... I feel pretty good, actually Ah, Christ, I'm sweating like a rapist. And you, you haven't even broken a sweat yet. Here we go. There. Now at least you look like you've been running. A-Are you Drew Callahan? Taylor Reese. I was friends with Erik. We played football together in high school. I was the one that threw him all those touchdowns. Remember that? I think I met you, um, our senior year after that game against Drake. You have to remember that one. It was a real barnburner. - Right, yeah. - State championship. Taylor, right. Sorry, uh, kind of pathetic, a 35-year-old guy reliving his high school glory. No, it's, uh... Well, listen, it was really good seeing you. Uh, if you see your brother Erik, let him... Here. Give me... Uh, hope everything's going good for you. Say hi to Erik for me. So have you heard from your dad lately? Yeah, I talked to him about a week ago. Oh, you should talk to him more often. I spoke to him yesterday. I think he might be coming home for Christmas this year. Has he said anything to you about that? Uh, no, he didn't... he didn't say anything. Hmm. Well, it really will be a merry Christmas if he can just get all that stuff from that estate finalized and get home. Maybe by then, you and Kate'll have a special gift on the way, and then, you know, it'll be a perfect Christmas. Why are you listening to Christmas music? Oh, because it's beautiful... happy, makes me happy. It's June. $0? Christmas is six months away, Mom. Well, why should I wait six months to be happy? You are relentless in the way That you ask me So many questions of my days In the calm city of my days In the city You are relentless in the way That you ask... Ask me So many questions of my days How's your mom? Other than the fact my dad told her he might be coming home for Christmas, terrific. Your dad's coming home for Christmas? Of course not, Kate. It's been nine years. He's never coming back. I don't know why my mother can't get that through her skull! I win. I win I've got the most fucked-up parents on the planet. My mother's an idiot. He lies to her, Ryan. He's the one you should be angry with. He tells her that he's dealing with his parents' estate. He tells her that the French government is screwing everything up. He tells her that his... his heart problem prohibits him from flying. For nine years! Who believes that? I know. I get it. It's not exactly... Normal. Practical. She believes what she wants to believe, what she needs to believe in order to survive. The results came back from Dr. Klein. Your sperm passed the test. Great. At least my cum's got its shit together. Yeah. So, um, we can have sex tonight. Um, then no sex for 48 hours, but, uh, we can tonight if you want. You don't have to. I'm okay. I'm fine, good to go. I'm gonna go upstairs. I'll be upstairs. Hi. Hey, how are you doing this morning? Good. Uh, chocolate sugar twist, three dough nut holes and a black coffee. Yeah. Earlier this evening, family, friends and supporters gathered for a vigil for the missing girl. Anybody watching this? As far as Fresno came, bringing flowers... Good. Just want to check the Dodger highlights. Two on and two outs. And Johnson's first hit, and laces it into the gap in left center field. Parilla scores, Revie scores, and Hudson hasn't... All right, so we've left Maggie in the park, right? And she's got her one-year-old, and they're in the stroller, and as they're walking to the playground, she sees this really hot black couple. African-American. We have an African-American president, Archie Bunker. Okay, all right. Well, I didn't vote for him. So, uh, anyway, this super-hot African-American couple has got a ridiculously cute African-American baby also in a stroller, and as the two groups approach each other, you know, they're oohing and ahhing over the babies and saying the other one's cuter and all this stuff, and, uh, Maggie asks how old her son is, and she gets down in front of the stroller and says, "Hi, little monkey!" No, okay, come on. Bear with... This really happened to my wife. M-My wife really did this. Um, and so right after Maggie says this, she gets that hilarious look on her face, you know, and she immediately turns to her son and goes, "And here's my little monkey." You know? And she's so embarrassed that she just calls everything- man, woman, child, animal... everything's a monkey. Monkey, monkey, monkey, monkey. She just keeps saying everything's a monkey, and the other couple, I mean, they're just kind of backing away from her, you know, not sure. What do you think? I didn't know your wife was such a racist. Shut up, Allan. Wh-What do you think? Allie? It's great. I think it's kind of funny. Is it... Is it too offensive? I don't think so. Were you even listening? Yeah. I just... I don't get why you're asking me. Come on, Allie. Are you serious? I mean, you're the only black... uh, the only African-American writer in the room. Way to point out the obvious, Bill. I just don't get why you would think that I would know if that's bad or not. It's a misunderstanding. It's funny. Anybody who thinks that's racist is probably some uptight black asshole who wishes somebody would call him a monkey so he could complain about it. Finding reasons to complain is just another form of laziness, and honestly I don't have the time or the tolerance for it. You do know those lids come off, right? Thank you, class. You did good. See you tomorrow. Mr. Aston. Yeah, Tina? Um, you know how you were talking about that... talking about Martin Luther King last week and how he, you know, put himself in harm's way so that others could have a better life? Sure do. Well, my mom and I went online and read some more about him. Really? Yeah, and, um, it made me sad what happened to him. I was wondering, do you think the world would have been a better place if he hadn't been killed? I don't know, but it sure became a better place because he was alive. Yeah. Yeah, that's true. Well, thanks for telling us about him. Sure. - Bye. - Bye. Do you love her? Love? I'm starting to think that I, uh... I'm not so certain what that word means. You know, intellectually I do, but... intimate love... I seem to have emotionally forgotten what that means. She's like my mom. They just insulate themselves from reality. It's like they're looking at life through a windshield, so thick that they could watch a nuclear explosion. I don't even have a glass in mine... and the Wind's whipping me and making my eyes teary, and I can barely even keep them open. - Great choices. - Thanks. I love this dress. Did you see the adorable little shoes that go with it? - No. - Oh, my gosh. How cute are these? Very. I'll get those, too. Okay, great. Are these gifts? Um... uh, this one is. Okay. Your daughter's gonna look so cute in this dress. Uh, hey, sorry. Excuse me. You don't happen to know whose dog this is, do you? No. Sorry. Well, It's just that I found it in the street running around the other day. It didn't have a collar or anything. She's cute. You should keep her. Wait. It's a girl? Yes. You might want to make sure she's fixed. Right, make sure she's neutered. Spayed. Boys get neutered. Spayed, not neutered. - No. - No. I'll let you know if I hear anything. Okay, thanks. Everyone's here. We're good to go. Gonzo, you're the main tank. Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Remember this guy heals, so get ready. Today marks the fourth day since little Christie Dillon's disappearance. Her father Paul held a news conference out in front of his house to defend himself against accusations that he somehow may have been involved. Gonz, you want it? Uh, yeah. Jim, use your fire magic, dude! All right, I got it! I got it! Dragging their feet in this investigation. On Capitol Hill today... Watch your flank! Watch your flank! - It's on your six! - Shit. - Uh, I, uh... - Unbelievable! You're thinking about the princess! She was taken from her home. We can't just leave her there. - Dude, you just wiped the raid! - Jesus, Gonz! We need to focus up! I have to leave, help the princess. What? You can't! If you do that, you're out for good! Where are you going? Come on, dude. He's an asshole. Get rid of him. Here we go! Come on! W-Where is he going? How are we gonna heal without him? Come on! That's insane! We're finally gonna get this guy! I can't believe this. We're gonna have to start this level all over! I lost my job at the magazine three months ago. I don't know. The, um... The pressure of work and taking care of him... it just got to me. Everyone thinks he's brain-dead... except me. And I know he's not because of the way he looks at me sometimes. I know he's in there, and that's why I... we gotta do this race. He always wanted to run that fucking thing. He's run every other major city marathon in the country. This was from his last race, the San Francisco Marathon. He placed in the top Somehow I don't think we're gonna do that good this time. We're gonna finish it. We're gonna finish it. Yeah. No, I understand what you're saying. Oh, Christ. I thought that we had gotten past that, Greg. You're clinging to this theory like a frigging flat-Earther. It doesn't hold water. You can't expect me to believe that her parents think that she would intentionally hurt Erik. Well, that is absolutely crazy talk. Fine. Bring it to the arbitrator. Let him decide. Yeah. Yeah. She's sober. Her tests come back negative every week. That means she's clean. Oh, fine. No, I don't have anything else. Thank you for being so fucking reasonable, Greg! I hope that you can sleep well tonight. Crap. You still haven't found the owner? Oh, yeah. I mean, no, not... not yet. Hey. She's a, um... a weim... How do you say it? Weimaraner. Weimaraner. Yeah. Right, I can never remember that Hey. Are you planning a trip somewhere? Oh, no, I'm just... I... I don't know. Maybe sometime, but not... not now. She's really cute. Have you named her? I'm just calling her Carol right now. Wha... Yikes. Carol? It's... I don't know. It's my sister's name. I guess I don't really... I just don't really know that many girls' names. What's your name? E-Evan. Hi. I'm Allegra. Now you know two girls' names. You know, it's really nice to have a guy on the beat in the neighborhood. Makes everyone feel safer, you know. Thanks, Tony. I appreciate that. Wait right here. You don't tell anyone. This is for you. Oh, I... I, uh... It's policy. I-I'm not allowed. Policy? Yeah. It's ridiculous. It's cannoli. Um, I... I could buy it. They're on special, two for a dollar. I get 4 bucks apiece for those. Yeah, that's a... that's a pretty good special. Here. All right. You know we're in a drought. Hey, Detective. Are you doing the work on this house alone? Yeah, uh... Yeah. Yeah, it's a labor of love, you know. Six months, it's... it's a big job. So did you come here to admire my house, or you, uh... you gonna take me up on my offer, you know, picnic, a drink, dinner? No. No, actually, uh, I need your help about something. See, I was thinking about the statement you gave inside the station yesterday, and... and something doesn't seem right. What's that? Why were you eating lunch at the softball field the day you picked up Christie and Heather? I beg your pardon? Well, I mean, you said you eat lunch there every day, but when I asked the neighbors around the field if they'd ever seen your truck before, they said no, never seen it. Well, they're just plain wrong. I go there every day. I... I eat my sandwich. I watch a T-ball game or a softball game. Can you prove that, Mr. Beckworth? I don't go there at the same time every day. I don't eat my lunch at any set hour. It's funny. The mothers that live around that field, they're kind of nosy, and they have a really great Neighborhood Watch program. Detective, I'm not gonna argue with you. I've got no reason to lie about eating my sandwich at Memorial Park, whether I show up there at 3:00 or 12:00 or park my truck a foot away from where it was the day before. Please, believe me. Right. Forget about the drought. A garden like that's gonna attract a lot of attention. You gonna give me a ticket? No. It's not my department. I was just, you know... You giving me a warning? Well, thank you for the warning. Don't start with me. I've had a hell of a day. We're gonna run and then I think we need to start pulling back by Sunday, okay? Oh, shit. Ohh. I forgot she was coming by Coming! Don't move. Sorry about that. I totally forgot about the time, but come on back. Oh. Um, if you're busy, I can... No, it's fine. Come in. He's not shy. Okay... Sorry about that. It always happens around attractive women. This is my brother. Hello, Erik. I'm Kate. Can you hand me the, um, pitcher behind you? Thank you. - Thanks. - Sure. Actually, do you think you could give me a hand? Of course. Of course. What, uh... What can I do? I'm gonna lift him, and if you could just rinse the, uh, soap out of his hair. Yes. Okay... There we go. - Okay? Just like this? - Yeah. That's great. Thanks. I was gonna get his hair cut for Sunday, but I think it looks pretty good longer. Don't you? Yeah, I like it long. What do you think of the moustache? Um, let's see. I like the moustache. I hate it. Will you hold up his arm? Um, yeah. Thanks. So you've been sober about six months now. How exactly did that happen? Did you wake up one morning and decide that you'd hit rock bottom? Um, I think it was more like I hit the bottom, and then the rock fell on me. You don't think we're gonna win this case, do you? Isn't this hard for you? Yeah. Yeah, it's hard. It's really fucking hard, hardest thing I've ever done. You have kids? No. Me neither. But I imagine it's a lot like having a baby. A really big, heavy baby that you have to shave and you get to curse around. You didn't answer my question. He can't go in one of those places. He needs me. And I need him. Armando Hyde.

Good birthday so far? Best birthday now that you're here. A couple of friends took me to Katsuya for dinner, and I made them promise to get me back by 10:00. You didn't have to do that. Could have done this on another night. No, I've been waiting for this all day. All right, wait a second. Wait a second. Hold on. Don't you want to talk a little bit before your birthday fuck? No. Wait here. Okay... Get in here! You like? Yeah. Yeah, you look great. Oh, God. Do you have a condom, T? Are you okay? Yeah. Yeah. Did you just... I did. Sorry. I just... You know, your bra, you looked hot and... I'm sorry. I gotta go... I was bad from early on. I just... You can't stay longer? I can't, sweetie. All right. I'll call you when I'm... when I'm out. Okay? Happy birthday, baby. I'll make it up to you, I promise. I got to pee. It's okay if I pee, right? I... I think so, yeah. Sure. I won't be long. You ready? Yeah. Right, baby? You're in here. Hey, it's gonna be great. I'll see you in, what, an hour or so? Well, by the time the anesthesia wears off, it's probably more like a couple of hours. A couple of hours. Quick. - Will you follow me? - Yeah. You guys always open on Saturdays? Baby-making's a seven-day-a-week thing. After focusing their early interest on Roger Beckworth, it seems like investigators are back to square one. Today they began retracing all of the steps of their initial evidence gathering. As you can see, they're taking what appears to be the family computer. Officials are not speaking to us about this latest development, but obviously they think there might be some information that could help them in figuring out what happened to little Christie Dillon. Well, that's an interesting development. Keep us posted on that, Al. Hey, Mom, can I go to Magic Mountain with Julie's family tomorrow? Sure. She said I could go! But it's my day off today, - so you and I are gonna... - Oh, my gosh. I cannot wait to ride the... hang out. So here it is. All right. Looks like it's all here. Okay... Say, "Please whip me." Please whip me more. - Louder! I can't... - Please whip me more! You want it harder? You forgot the command. God! Fuck. Damn it. Louder! Yes, ma'am! Say, "Please whip me." Please whip me more. Louder! I didn't... Please whip me more! You want it harder? Yes. You forgot the command. Come on. Louder. Yes, ma'am. Come on. Come 0... Hey. Hey, what's up, baby? W-What are you doing? What do you think I'm doing? Yeah. Uh, hi. Oh, great. You're done. We were getting worried about you. Yeah, somebody might want to talk to the building manager about a little heat in... in the room. That would, uh, help things along. Okay... Yeah, and, uh, also your... the magazines are worn out. Okay... And the... the videos are, uh... They're not accessible. Okay... I've never met a person in my life who so completely inspired me. When I first saw you in the U-Cen surrounded by those three girls... I thought that you looked like a womanizing frat guy. And after you bought me that cup of coffee and you tried out the worst pickup line I had ever heard... And, no, I'm not gonna embarrass him by telling you all what he said, but trust me. It was bad. After everything that you gave me, my sweetheart, I can at least promise you that I can take that one to my grave. I love you, Sam. Excuse me. I'm sorry. Do you want me to meet you at your house? Would you like to go to lunch? Um, yeah. I just... Let me grab a... a water. I will never forgive you for this, Drew, everything you've put us through... - Mom... - All this torture. First you destroyed your brother's life, and if that wasn't enough, you had to destroy ours, too. How could you do this to us? This to you? I'm the one who wants to take care of him, not stick him in a home somewhere. He needs qualified, responsible caregivers. He needs people who love him. Love? You talking about the kind of love where you put somebody else's needs before your own? Are you going to do that? You are far too selfish for that. Mrs. Bryant, please. Your son is coming home. No more talking from you. No more talking from you. You've done enough. So tell me something about yourself. Oh, I don't know. Like what? I don't know. It doesn't have to be some deep, dark secret. Okay... I was born with an extra kidney. No, I swear to God It's just a little one. It doesn't do anything. But, look, when I was 10 I went to school one day, and there was this kid who said that his cousin or somebody had been traveling overseas and someone had kidnapped him and drugged him and tried to steal his kidney and sell it on the black market. On the black market? You believed this? Well, I was 10, so all I'm thinking is "Whoa, I got a huge pile of cash sitting inside here," and... and I put an ad in the local paper. You put an ad out in the paper? Well, what were you gonna charge for your own little baby kidney? $500 or best offer. That's not a bad deal. I thought so. So how are you going to deliver the goods - when somebody called for your... - I was 10. I hadn't thought the thing through all the way, okay? - But I did get one call. - No, you didn't. Yeah, I swear to God. And so, of course, then my parents found out, and they thought I'd lost my mind, so they made me go see a shrink, and then everyone in school found out, and this... this one kid filled my locker with, like, 40 cans of kidney beans. It was awful. Anyway, it kind of put a stigma on me that lasted a while. That's kind of sad. Yeah. You probably think I'm a total weirdo now, huh? No. I mean, you were 10. If anything, it's indicative of your early entrepreneurial spirit. Your parents should have encouraged it. Right. Okay, your turn. My turn for what? Tell me something about you. Come here. I hate black people. Th-That's, um... I'm guessing that can be a problem sometimes. Yeah. Will... Will you stop... Please stop taking my picture. You know, I didn't come up here to watch you sweat your balls off running the hills of San Francisco. I came here to make sure you shave that prison pussy ASAP. You know what? This is... it's very good luck. Oh, the race is over, so unless you want to audition for a Village People tribute band, it's got to go. Oh, my God. It really bothers you, doesn't it? Yeah. Every picture I have of my brother running one of these races... Oh, look, he looks like a gay porn star running from a bunch of rabid fans. Someday, uh, you're gonna have to run one of these with me. Thanks for the offer, Well, that's never gonna happen. Besides, I don't have time to train. No, really. Yeah. Yeah, I'm busy. Doing what? Vampires get more shit done in the day than you. Come on. All you got is time. We are 15 seconds away from this year's SoCal Marathon. You ready? 5,4,3,2,1! I had a date with a guy last night, and we're seeing each other again later today. So it went well. Yeah, it was great. And then I told him I hate black people. Okay, and how did he react to that? He laughed, and... he was kind of weirded out, more uncomfortable than freaked, I think, because he's a white guy. Why do you, uh... Why do you think you did that? I don't know. Um, I like to see white people squirm? Do you like this guy? I do. I really do. Sometimes I feel like I have these automatic responses for white guys. I just... I wish I'd never told him that, you know. I... I wish I'd never said that. "I hate black people." Why? Did he say something to trigger that from you? No. He told a story, and it was vulnerable and sweet. He's a sweet, nice guy. I think I... pushed him away, like I do with everyone at my job. I'm the only black person working on this show, and I just... I get so angry. Ah, scratch that. Uh... the two security guards at the gate, they... they're black. And there's another- another executive who is female also, and she's black. And the valet, he's black. Why does it bother you? Because I feel like I'm selling out. I mean, look at you. You were recommended to me from my white writer friend. You know, I should be with a black therapist. Allegra, if you're uncomfortable, I could recommend... No, no, it's... I want to get to the bottom of this, and... I like being black. It's just I don't like being black sometimes around white people and some black people. I just feel like... like I'm some kind of a fake. Like when I, uh, drive up to the gate and the two black security guards are there, one of them, he looks at my car, you know, and he looks at me, and he's sizing me up, and I feel like... I feel like he's looking at me and he's thinking that I'm trying to be white or something. And the other security guard, he doesn't care. He just wants to flirt with me. That's why I only hate some black people, because some of them are suspicious, and the rest don't care, you know. They're fine. What are you? Don't care or suspicious? Suspicious, and I'm getting really tired of myself. I don't... I don't want to hate anybody, black or white, you know. I... I want to fall in love. I want Evan to like me. I want to spend more time with my niece. That'd be nice. I want my dad to, uh. To still be alive. Uh, I want, uh... I want to lose five pounds. That's important. I want... I want a back rub. I want to be swept off my feet. I want to be taken on a trip to Jamaica for a month. You only used the word "hate" once just now. Ah, eureka. I want you to try something. I want you to be really nice to anybody that you think is suspicious. Just see how that goes. Okay... Allegra. Okay, I'll do it. - Okay. - Okay. Tissue, right there. Yeah. I just... You know, I'll get around to that tissue. All right. Keep going! All the way through! All the way through! Oh, hey. Good morning. Hey. Got the downloads from Dillon's hard drive. It's as bad as they say it is? Yeah, it's worse. Oh. - Frankie. - Yeah? So what's up with the results of the review of Dillon's hard drive? It's right here. They just handed me the file. Now, this is what you call a real lead on a real suspect. You're gonna have to bring him back in again. Today. Already planning on it. Look, I know it's a little, um... Perverted Yeah, but it's not necessarily illegal. The guys are looking into some of the photos, and the girls are young, but it doesn't mean they're breaking any laws. But he's definitely got a thing for young girls. So did my ex-husband. Yeah. You call me after you talk to him, okay? All right. Yo, you okay? Hey, can we get some help over here! Come here! Easy, easy. All right. You okay? Yeah. Ls my brother... Is he... He seems all right. Can he speak? Pretty sure you dislocated your shoulder, miss. Now I'm just gonna get you something... Try to hold still. Thank you. Thank you for saving my life. It's been four days since Christie's disappearance, and frustrations amongst officials and in the community are running high, but today comes news that the investigation has shifted away from the neighbor Michael Beckworth altogether and so leads to the father, Andrew Dillon. Now, Mr. Dillon has been adamant about his innocence, and, though police have not officially called him or anyone else a suspect, the feeling is that an indictment will be coming any day now. I wish every day was Christmas... Hi. Hi. Thanks for coming over so quickly. No problem. I was in the office, so I'm close. Working on Sundays isn't good for your marriage, honey. Thanks, Mom. Jesus Christ. Mom, you're gonna blow up the house. Look, if the pilot doesn't light, you got to turn off the gas. Oh, how am I supposed to know that? Your father always deals with that kind of thing. No. Mom, no, not any more. Not for nine years. He's not lighting the pilot light today. He didn't clean the gutters out last spring. He didn't flip the breakers in the fuse box when they popped the winter before last, and he did not drive you to the hospital. When you fell in the driveway, you fell, Mom, and I drove you. I did, Mom. Mom, I did. Me. I don't understand why you won't listen to me when I talk about him. I hear everything you say. But you don't listen, Mom. I know you think I'm a fool, your kooky mother. You know, you were always a lot more like him, only dealing in the facts, proof, evidence. I... I don't think you ever believed in anything without those conditions. Not the Easter Bunny. Not Santa Claus. I remember when you were... I think you were 10. We were in this kitchen, and I was baking you Rice Krispies squares, and I asked you why you didn't believe in God, and do you remember this'? Do you remember what you said'? You said, "Where's the evidence?" "Should I just believe that because I can..." "flap my arms, I can..." y?-. I was a real pain in the ass, wasn't I? You still are, but I love you. I just don't see the point in deluding yourself. What good has ever come from lying to yourself, Mom? Love. I'm... Love, there's no litmus test for it, is there? I mean, there's no proof. I mean, how do you know... how do you know that I love you? I mean, really, you don't know. Because you just told me you did. Ah, I could have been lying to you all these years. I trust you, Mom. Your grandma and grandpa, now, that's an incredible love story, isn't it? I mean, that was perfect, right? Well, what proof do we have that they didn't just meet during the war in a less dramatic way? You must have told me that story a hundred times when I was little. It was your favorite bedtime story. Is that all it was, Mom? A bedtime story? Some bullshit story you tell a kid to help him to sleep? Not to help you go to sleep. It was a story to get a boy to understand the... the capacity of love, and maybe now it's become a story to understand the importance of belief without evidence... trust without reservation faith. We have to leave now. Can I get you a ride home? Okay, take care. Yeah? Who is it? It's your neighbor. - Hey. - Can we talk? Um, yeah. What about? C-Can I come in? Yeah. I don't get it. I don't know why you guys don't just arrest that neighbor. Uh, I'm sorry. What- What are you talking about? The neighbor of the missing girl, you know, Beckworth. The Christie Dillon case. Wh-Why can't you guys just arrest him? Uh, I believe he was... he was brought in for questioning by the police. I... I don't think they had enough on him to hold him. Have they searched his house? I... I don't know. It's... It's not my division. Well, somebody needs to tell somebody to get over there. There's not much time. She could be dead already. Do... Do you have some sort of proof or some sort of evidence that... I just know she's there. Okay, it's... it's Carter, right? Carter, maybe... maybe you should go back to your apartment, and don't worry about these things. It's really... It's not... not your responsibility. Whose responsibility is it, then? I mean, you're a cop. You don't even think it's your responsibility. We're everyone's responsibility, all of us, each other's. I've always taught my kids that a society fails if we don't look out for each other. How can people not see that? Hey, hey, hey, hey! What are you doing? Where you going? To look out for someone. Shit. Whoo. Hey. Best seats in the house. Yeah, here you go. Thank you. Yeah, you're gonna like her. She's really good. What are all these things for? They're just toys. Don't hit that one. Can I see that for a second? - Here you go. - Thank you. We Dear Are Are, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh We're damn dolls Alive Sta)' Here Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh My head leaves me small Mr. Dillon, I mean, these images we found on your computer, they're... Not illegal. All right, we'll see about that. It's fantasy. it... I had nothing to do with my daughter's disappearance. Then why don't you take me through when you noticed when she first was missing? I... I told you! I told everybody a hundred times! Well, then tell me again. Take me through it minute by minute. Hey. Hey, hey, hey! What are you doing? What are you doing? What you people should have done a long time ago. He did something with her. All right, you don't... You don't know that, all right? She... She's not in there, all right? Come on. Let's go, or you're gonna get arrested, come on. Then arrest me. What can I do for you, huh? Who are you? What the hell's going on? We were just... It's a small misunderstanding. This is my house. This is private property. Come on. Carter, let's go. Carter, come on. Let's go. Carter! No! No! What?! Carter! No! Carter! What?! No! What?! Come on now! - Carter! - Stand up for the least of America Lay down like a naked dead body Keep it real for the people working overtime Because they living off the government dime Stand up for the people of America Stand up for the man next door 'Cause you're free in the land of America... What are you doing? What are you doing? Stop! Stop. I didn't do anything! I didn't do anything! Shoot him! Where's your gun?! I didn't do anything! Call for backup! That means you... I'm not... I'm not a cop. What? I'm not... I'm not a cop. You're just... just nothing! I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Not a cop? Like a naked dead body Keep it real for the people working overtime Because they live off the government dime Stand up for the people of America Stand up for the man next door 'Cause you're free in the land of America Not gonna die like this Come on, now You don't know me! No! No! Oh, my God. Oh, my G... What? What do I do? Just... go. Go. Help! Help! AHO Uh, Salut, Adrienne. C'est Ryan. Oh, bonjour, Ryan. Comment ga va? Bien. Et vous? Bien. Trs bien. Bon. Ou est mon pre? Ah, oui. Je vais le charger. Bon soir. Toi aussi. Hello. Hi. Everything okay? No, not really, Dad. What's going on? I'm having an affair. Why? I don't know. I figured that you might be able to help me figure that out. After all, you've got a lot more experience in this than I do. I saw that the screen had been removed from the window. Joan was freaking out. I grabbed the phone, called the police. Hey, Beckworth's dead. We got officers on the scene, but it looks like, uh, there's another victim. And, Frankie, there's something else. Stunning, really. Police showed up on the scene and found him trying to open the trapdoor that led to the hidden cellar under the house. Now, we've not been allowed in to see it, but by all accounts, it's a virtually soundproof prison cell where he kept little Christie Dillon for the past six days. It's incredible. Al, you just spoke to the lead investigator on this a few moments ago. What did she have to say? Yes, I did. Let's roll the tape of the interview with Detective Francesca Graylin of the LAPD. Could you tell us what you know so far? Well, the investigation is still ongoing. I can tell you that Christie has been returned to her family. It appears Roger Beckworth had something to do with her abduction. Mr. Beckworth was found dead in his home with another person. There are conflicting reports that the other person was a police officer or former police officer? He was a cadet for a short time before his dismissal. Can you tell us why he was dismissed? No, I can't speak to that. Then are we sure that he was involved in this? Yes. Uh, look, like I said, the investigation is still ongoing. Uh, all I can say is that it looks like he came over to confront Mr. Beckworth, but we're not sure if or how he knew Christie was in there, so that's really all I can say. Thank you, Detective. Thank you for your time. All right, Al. Thank you. We'll check back with you whenever you have new developments in that case. But right now, we're gonna go to Tricia Alexander, who is standing by with an amazing story. Trish? Thanks, Jim. Well, you have that right. As viewers know, today was the annual SoCal Marathon. Of course, the champions were crowned earlier this morning, and the race itself closed hours ago, but it's apparently not over for one very determined racer. Make that two very determined racers. What do you want me to say? I'm a bad father? I'm a bad husband? What I did to your mother was a mistake of a lifetime in a lifetime full of mistakes? I just... I want you... No, I need you to fix it. I don't know how to fix it. It's easy, okay? Just tell her the truth. Listen, in human relations, kindness and lies are worth a thousand truths. Goodbye, Dad. Hey. Hi. I thought you were coming home later. Nope. The, uh... in vitro didn't take. It's okay, sweetie. We'll just try again. Okay? There it is. There it is, Erik. Great job Nice work, buddy. Ma'am, ma'am... Congratulations. - Yeah! - Whoo! Congratulations. You are relentless In the way that you ask me So many questions of my days in the city I wish that I could tell you something But I'm a hostage of my pride And I'll take all the heat you're packing... Good morning. I was getting coffee today, and I thought that you guys might like some. I didn't know what kind that you'd like, so I got one cappuccino and one regular coffee. I'll just have- I'll take the coffee. Okay. Great. You guys have a nice day. You, too. You, too. Yeah. Yeah. Thank you. You are relentless In the way that you love me I'm afraid of the thoughts that you're making Listen... let's get together soon. I wish that I could know the difference Between your smiles and your frowns Now I'm buried in the armor 'Cause I'm an iron man. I'm an iron man.
