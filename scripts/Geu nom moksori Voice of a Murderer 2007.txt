Director HAN, three minutes to standby. So, what's your closing for today? Hey, now. I hear people are really looking forward to it. Everyone's talking about it, you know, about your closing statements being so refreshing. You know the viewers always come first. That's the last ad, now. Ten seconds left. Alright, five seconds. Standby. Super, start. Second camera on standby and cut! Good evening, everyone. We didn't have many days of laughter this year. Standing at the finish line of the nineties, we all had high hopes for this year. We struggled hard against the tide of change around the world, and within our country, - it was a year that demanded - Thirteen. we wake up and realize our faults as we face Fourteen. the beginning of the twenty-first century. - Now, DBC News will begin. - Seventeen. Eighteen. Just a little more. We declare war against crime and violence... Yes, it's been a long time since our president seemed so trustworthy. However, despite his ambitions and declarations, this was a banner year for crime. Briefly said, it was a crisis for public welfare. In the year ahead, I hope the average Joe will be able to keep the smile on his face. Trust you, sir? Believe me, we'd like to. VOICE OF A MURDERER - Hey, look sharp up there. - Min-sun... - Min-sun! - We haven't taken a picture yet! In this case, the suspect was someone that knew the family, and when he didn't get the ransom, Yoo Min-sun he choked the child to death and buried her body. So this case shows how kidnappers that destroy families are always nail, always brought to justice. Yes, now we can't even send our kids to school with peace of mind. Mr. President wants our trust, but the world is in chaos. The police are working very hard, but it seems they need to work harder. What good is it to catch the criminal, when Min-sun was taken away screaming and returned cold and lifeless? Crime is beyond the reach of the law. Must forensic science also be out of our reach? Madam, would you please open the door? Late again, like any other day. Look at what time it is. Ah, home sweet home. You reek of alcohol. Oh, you don't like it? Should I leave? Sure, go on. Did you pay for the drinks? Of course. I'm the man. Is he asleep? He's asleep. He's asleep. The heir to my throne. Get up, kiddo. You're a third-generation only son. Come on, Dad's home. Gotta get up! Dad... Good boy. Plant one right here. My heir, you believe in your old man, right? I'll take care of it, so eat all you want. So what if you gain a little weight? Huh? You're a man. A man sticks it out, eh? Cool and strong to the end. Okay? Yeah, okay. Honey, stop. Your old man will take care of Mom. Have I ever lied to you? Huh? Come on, honey. Let him sleep. Or not. 1200 families are living in houses for normal citizen that's 106 square meter. 1060 families are living in apartments, that's from 122 to 244 square meter. In Bundang's case, house for normal citizen that's from 69 to 86 square meter. Through them for scale, 760 families are living in rental houses that's from 46 to Come on, let's eat. Now, Sang-woo, let's pray. Our Father, who art in Heaven, Hallowed be thy Name. Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread. June, 3 weeks, Breakfast And forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us. And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil: For thine is the kingdom, the power, and the glory, for ever. Amen. Does it hurt? How is it? How about here? I'm tired. Open your arms. Friday, June 14th. Weather: clear skies. Sometimes it's like my mom is a stepmom. She gets a kick out of torturing me. Today, she said my feet look like pig's feet. That was harsh. I mean, I want to be nice and skinny too, but not if it means more gruel and beans. Jumping rope and acupuncture sucks, too. Will anyone ever understand my agony? I want to die. My dear son! I'm sorry that I hurt you. Mom loves you so much. We'll get through this together. Superman, the mighty prince of bravery. Batman and Robin, soldiers of justice. Don't come in. DBC's nine o'clock news will begin now. Hello, every... Ugh, why can't I do it like Dad? Going down. Son, hurry on up. Mom, you're so mean. You're evil. It's not like you do it too... I hate you. Good job. Here. Now, let's put on your pedometer. I'm not your real son, am I? I love you. Mom, Just this once. I'm like one step away from dying. Just stick it out a little more. Then we'll take a nice picture of you once you drop a few pounds. You know what the neighbors call you? Are you that ashamed of me, Mom? Don't be silly, it's just bad for your health. Do you want to grow into a total pig? Hmm? This is all because Mommy loves you. My tooth is shaky. The one in the back. Where? You still need to wait a few days. Now, go on down. Sang-woo's birthday How is my Superman necktie today? If only everything was as dear as the heart of Yoo-jin, who ran for miles on barefoot everyday to buy medicine for her sick mother. Yoo-jin's symbolic swollen feet are truly touching. They say children have hearts of gold. We adults could learn a lot from our kids. Have a pleasant evening, everyone. Good work, everyone. Alright, good work everybody. Your closing statement was really touching. You might have to run for office soon. - A man like you... - Shh. Are you really running? If the people want me to... Sir, come on. Good show today, sir. - Yeah, you too. - Which party? Democrat? Republican? Yes, is this Jin-ho's house? Right, It's just our Sang-woo isn't home yet. Come on now, stop. Even if he were to call home he wouldn't be able to get through. Honey, should we call the police? Call the police? No, just wait a minute. No, let's call them. Just wait a minute, will you? Teachers and security guards use large sacks to restrain the culprit. These drills are the result of the unfortunate kidnapping and murder of a young student in Nara City, last November. Hello? Sang-woo, is that you? Hello? Hello? It's Dad. Hello? Sang-woo, Sang-woo. Hel... Hello. Hello? Hello. I've been enjoying the news. What? Sang-woo's father, I presume? Yes, that's me. Who is this? Who is it? Huh? Who? Well, you're much calmer than I expected you to be. Excuse me? Who, who are you? I have Sang-woo. Sang-woo is with me. Hello? Who are you? Why is Sang-woo with... Sang-woo is there? Ah, I see now you do have a short temper. Have one hundred grand, cash, ready by tomorrow, and have a phone installed in your car. The phone must be answered before it rings three times. Three times. I will call back tomorrow. - Hello? - Who is it? Hello? Oh, and I probably don't need to tell you, but if you go to the authorities or upset me, Sang-woo dies. Hello? Hello! Help me... Dad... Help me... Where are you going? Hours Missing: 8 I asked you where you're going. To work. You're going to work at a time like... The entire country watches our news. I can't back out on a commitment like that. I'll go and get someone to take over, get some time off and get a loan. Don't worry, just trust me. I'll call you after I get the car phone, so don't go anywhere. Don't call the police, alright? Stay calm. How am I supposed to be calm? Honey, let me come too. I'm scared. No, he might call again. You have to pull yourself together. Honey... First, let's just do what he says. Nothing's going to happen, okay? Sang-woo will be fine... I promise I'll bring him home today. You promise? Promise to come home with Sang-woo. Of course. Honey, I still think we should call the... No. Absolutely not. He just wants money. That's all this is. Catching the bastard isn't our problem. Alright? Just trust me. Request for a loan Oh, no. It's nothing to worry about... Well, I think she fell out in the field. Hours Missing: 14 Oh, that's okay. It'll only be for two days. I might even come back up tomorrow. You know me. Don't worry. Yeah, thanks. Don't mess up. Break a leg. Hours Missing: 18 Hours Missing: 20 Domestic terminal at Gimpo Airport? How am I going to find you if I don't know what you look like? That's the least of your worries. Is there a single person in Korea that doesn't know what you look like? Then, what about my son? Relax. If you do exactly as I tell you, I'll dock him with you safely. Hello? You said it's a Grandeur, number 3699? Are you sure Sang-woo's father is alone? Yes, We'll do anything you want. Please, let me talk to Sang-woo. Hello? Our son looks big, but he's very weak. It's late now. Has, has he eaten yet? He says he wants some Chinese takeout. Oh, no. He shouldn't eat food like that. Are you kidding me? Unspeakable... No, no, sir. Just please, let me hear his voice. Please? He's sound asleep from the cold medicine. What medicine? Leave the engine running and open the doors. Open the trunk, and turn the lights on. Then, leave the bag there and go home. Remember, you must be waiting at home. Hours Missing: 21 Hours Missing: 22 Hello, hello? What's going on here? What about my son? That's what I'd like to know. What? It seems maybe Sang-woo's mother doesn't want him to live. What? Hello? What are you talking about? The phone only rings three times. Tell her if she doesn't answer it even once, she'll never see her precious son again. Look here, we did everything you said! The doors were open, the keys and lights... Just give us back our son. Are you kidding me? Didn't I tell you to wait at home? Look, I left the doors open and all. What if some random person steals the car? You have more important things on hand. Hey, you. I mean sir. Sir, let's not do this. Let's meet in person. I just want my... I'm changing the location. Across the alley from the Daehan Cinema is the Geukdong Theater. Yes, yes. Slow down to 40 kilometers and keep it steady. Forty? Why? You ask too many questions. I'm following you. What? Where? Hello? Once you arrive, open the doors again. What about the keys? Just leave them? See, you're catching on... Go and wait at the teahouse across the street. Is Sang-woo with you right now? I can't always bring him along. But he's okay? Why, there's no need to ask. I'll dock him with you right away. Hours Missing: 23 Hello? I see you're finally answering the phone. My husband. You met him, right? I've just arrived. Please give him back. Our Sang-woo. Oh, now what should we do? The teahouse is closed... Pardon? The teahouse? Anyway... There's a chicken place around the corner. The alley is a little on the narrow side. Tell him to go there and wait. Yeah, okay. Don't worry. Gotta go. Jesus, what are you doing? Let go of me. Is it you? What? Where's my son? What are you talking about? Where is Sang-woo? Let go of me. Quiet down. I'm a cop. A cop. Try not to blow my cover. Why is there a cop here? She said not to tell you, but your wife reported the kidnapping. What? I'm going to starve him, starting from now. You want Sang-woo to die, don't you? Sir, how could I ever... Hello? Hello? No, no... Sang-woo. Don't starve him... Sir, we just want our son back. We don't need money or anything else. Silence. It hurts, so don't shout. I see many familiar faces in front of the theater. Shall I describe them for you? One is overweight and the other is of... No, no, we don't know... Please believe me. Don't kill him, please. Hello? Hello... Hello? Hello? OH Ji-sun, are you out of your mind? Didn't I tell you not to call the police? Thanks to the stupid cops there was no one at the chicken place! What are you going to do now? When he calls again, set another place... another place to meet, alright? You got it? Hurry up and get back to the chicken place. Hurry, hurry! Bring back Sang-woo! - Backs straight, chins up, - What's with the scarf, jerk? Days Missing: 2 - Who the hell are you? - Come closer. Do it right or I'll choke you with it, goddamn it. Get a move on, will you? Are the voice analysis results in yet? Sir, it's only been a couple of hours... See, this is the fucking problem. What's the best shot we've got? Huh? Wouldn't that be arresting him, sir? Forensic science makes that the voice, sir. Yeah, that motherfucker's voice. Yeah, that damned voice! There have been 11 phone calls so far and seeing how he never goes over two minutes, the suspect appears to be extremely intelligent and cunning. We've currently identified and are investigating six suspects. Are you saying that out of eleven calls, we couldn't get a single trace? Once, we kept him on for a while and traced him to the Samsung Trade Center. But that was before the kidnapping was reported... Right now, we have two of our men stationed down there undercover. You think he's an idiot? He won't call from there again knowing it'll be traced. Detective. I mean, I'm just saying. Let's be more scientific about it. Anyway, make sure this doesn't get out. We have to bring the kid back alive. Remember who the father is, alright? The nine o'clock news anchor. Especially you, Detective KIM. Control that foul mouth of yours, okay? Okay... Two jacks fell out over there by the entrance. Damn it. If only I could rush in all of them. Days Missing: 3 Good morning, everyone. This house is a real doozie. A killer view. Hello? Doozie! What's wrong with you? Let's run one more time. One, two, three. The bastard is sure to be brought in. Our special kidnapping division recently even... Who'll take responsibility when his life is put in jeopardy? Please have some faith in us, Mr. HAN. Responsibility my ass. Look here, Mr. HAN. You're the father, so it's crucial he comes back alive, but we're cops. We need to catch him. - What did you just say? - No, what I mean is... we need to catch the culprit to get Sang-woo back alive... So what we need to do now is to have hope and work together. Have faith, eh? That's right. The kidnapper won't be caught easily. No matter what, you must trust the police! Now, you've already made contact with him on your own, which was very risky. Luckily, your wife contacted us now, so please have faith and leave it to us. Actually, I don't know if I should say this... but, my girls were begging me to get them your autograph, if possible... My girls would also if that's okay... Days Missing: 4 You're really not eating? It's getting cold... You asked me if I had any enemies... I did seven years on camera reports alone. In reality, there must be thousands of people that lost their jobs, thanks to me. Can you bring in all those people? Well, of course. We should... But first, let's narrow it down from there to the big fish, the really fishy ones. I can't think of anything besides that. I just can't figure out who it could be... I've lived my life honestly, as a model citizen, and never did anything to hurt anyone. These black bean noodles are incredible. But why isn't he calling? Oh, don't worry about that. It's about time for the bastard to call. Hello? Hello? Hello? This is Sang-woo's mom. Did you call the police? I thought I told you he dies if you call them. What? No. Please, don't kill my son. Please. Do you want him to live? Do you really want to save Sang-woo? Who the hell are you? - Do you think this is funny? - Don't talk back to me. Who do you think you're talking to? What? You think you can get away with this? You've got some nerve, I'll give you that. Who's threatening whom now, huh? Excuse me? Get a grip, Mr. HAN. Look, whoever you are, I'll let it go. I'll give you all the money too. Hello? I'm getting tired. I ought to just finish him and all this... Sir, I apologize. I just lost it for a moment. I'll give you everything. Please... Let me at least hear my son's voice. He's alright, isn't he? Don't make that kind of mistake again. Once the money is received, Sang-woo will be safely docked I will call again. Hello? No, wait. Wait. No, please. Don't hang up. Hello? Why, are you trying to trace the call? One more mistake, and Sang-woo dies. Sir. I'm watching you. Every move you make. Sir, please. I'm down on my knees. Sir, I'll, I'll be a hostage instead of Sang-woo. I will call again. Sir, did he have something to eat? Did you give him something to eat? I'm watching you. Every move you make. The noodles are getting cold. It takes quite an optimist to be drooling and all. It takes quite an optimist to be drooling and all. Where, where the hell? Sang-woo, Sang-woo, Sang-woo. Sang-woo... Sang-woo! Father, I was so wrong. I was so wrong. I'm the sinner. Hurry and play it back. - Come on, rewind. - Wait. Stop there. - Hey, did you check the car? - Yes, sir. It was a resident. And the Chinese delivery guy? Huh? Oh, that. Yes, sir, it was just a delivery guy, so we didn't. - Get on it, now. - Yes, sir. Huh? What's wrong with this? - Play it back. - What is it? - Hurry up. - Just one minute. Son of a bitch. What the hell were you doing? What are those eyes attached for? You're telling me you idiots didn't know when he waltzed in and flipped the camera? What the hell are you doing here? - Where's KIM Wook-jung? - Kim... Hey, why are you standing here? How many times do I have to tell you, stay with Sang-woo's mother! - Get out! - Yes, sir. Nice going. Real nice. Who's the one that called me in... Inspector! Inspector! Hey, get every inch on photograph. Yes, sir. Let's see if anything comes up. Be careful not to wipe off the fingerprints. Sir, I have a feeling that this is Sang-woo's hideout, and since it could be someone they know, we'll have to be really thorough. Listen up! Don't miss a single hair! Yes, Inspector. Anyway. The noodles are getting cold. Hurry. Hurry on home, kid. Okay, thank you. - Can I get some more radishes. - Yes. The noodles will get cold. Shut up, asshole. You're under arrest for kidnapping. You have the right to a lawyer and anything you say may be used in court... Quiet down. Shush! Just be quiet. Days Missing: 7 1988, July to September Reported by 'camera reports' Kyung-bae, I know you're a hardass and all, but please, just let it go just this once. You can just report on something else. The viewers don't need to now everything. I swear, I'll never do it again. Honestly, who doesn't take a few bribes? All I did was clean up the leftovers, really. I'm sorry, Jae-jun. This isn't the kind of thing I can cover up. That money makes real estate prices skyrocket and becomes a civil burden. Since when are you a man of the people? Huh? We're friends! How can you do this to me? You wanna see me lose it? See me die? You think you're the president or something? Don't make me do something I'll regret... Ugh, Mr. HAN. Jesus, it's hot as hell. Damn it. Mr. HAN! It's like a sauna. Open the door, please? Sir, Mr. HAN, sir. Open it. It's too hot. Come on. Pretty please? This is supposed to open easily... God, this is such bullshit. Come on, open it a little, huh? I'm going out of my mind. Losing my nuts here. Geez. Sir, did you ask for a phone trace? Oh, the phone call ran a little short, so... Come on. Do something right, man. What happened to the delivery guy? He's a Chinese immigrant. What'd he ever do to you, huh? Stop barking up the wrong tree and just worry about your own trunk, sir. Go do your damn job, eh? Chinese, my ass. He spoke Korean better than me! While some of us rot away in a tiny ass trunk. I should fucking quit or something. What do I get for it? More money? Respect? Idiot, looking for some hope in life. Haven't even had clean boxers this week. When did forensics become some kind of country club? Kiss my fucking ass. There's forensics for ya. Here. Take your men out to dinner sometime. Yeah, Detective KIM. What about that suspect from yesterday? Dad, did you eat yet? Huh? Oh, sure. Sure. So did you take care of the paperwork? Do you have clean underwear left? It's raining a lot, are there any leaks? Make sure to turn the heat on at night. - And when you turn it on... - Worry about yourself, Dad. I'm sorry, kiddo. Oh, and I got a bonus for the stakeouts. Let's you and me go eat something nice. Hey, hey. I gotta hang up. Gotta go. Yeah, okay. Uh-huh, detective. Alright. Over and out. Isn't a stakeout supposed to be quiet and hidden? I'm closing the door. Son, your dad is sure living it up. Days Missing: 10 Hello? Hello? Oh my, Ji-sun. What's the hurry? Oh, Mother, Nothing. I was just expecting a call... Is Kyung-bae well? And my grandson? Yes, of course... Is Sang-woo doing well in school? Oh, yes. Let me talk to my precious grandson. I haven't heard his voice in ages. Well, the thing is... Well, come on. I'm not getting any younger. Put Sang-woo on the phone. Mother, Sang-woo went out just now to jump rope in the playground. Dear, losing weight is all fine and dandy, but aren't you being too harsh on him? Mind you, he's a third-generation only son. Mother, I'm actually waiting on an important call. I'll call you back soon. Ji-sun, now... Kyung-bae weighed far more at that age. Why are you making such a fuss about it? I just can't grasp it. Say, when is Kyung-bae coming back on TV? The new one, he's just not that good. It goes without saying, my Kyung-bae is the best. One, two, three. Hello? - Why didn't you call sooner? - Only I can ask the questions. Are you tapping the phones right now? What? What do you take me for? Look here, I'm not that kind of person. Silence. I'll be the judge of that. Are you sure Sang-woo is really your son? Is he really the precious, only son? What? Let your wife know that this is my last act of mercy. What, what are you saying? Hello? Sang-woo's mother has lost her senses and is holding up the line. I'm sorry, sir. But, is our son definitely with you? Please, at least let me hear his voice... All the more reason to listen to me. Everything has been taken care of. It'll be our Sang-woo's birthday soon. Please, hurry and let us see him. Apparently, Sang-woo is crazy about M&Ms. What? So, let's start again on a new day, shall we? Hello? Hello? This time, I want both of you to come to the Domestic terminal at Gimpo Airport. Hello. Did LEE Jae-jun make a move yet? Yes, sir. He's on the move right now. Okay. Track him and don't let him out of your sight. Yes, sir. I won't. It might be a double job, so if you see anything fishy, then use your radio. Detective PARK, track him good. Open it! What's wrong with you? You better open this door! You're taking a shower at a time like this? We don't even know if he's alive or not... Get out here, now. Now! Are you out of your damn mind? Put it on. Hurry! Put it on now! Don't touch me. Don't you dare. Where do you get the nerve... Go out there now and bring Sang-woo back! I'm losing my mind. I needed to do something, anything to pull myself together. I just... Sang-woo, Mommy's so sorry... Sang-woo... Honey, I think he knows about the police. What should we do? It's all my fault. What... No, no, don't. I'm sorry. It's not your fault. Don't worry. Our Sang-woo is alive. Hey Mister. Hi, Mr. Newsman. All vehicles report to the domestic parking lot. The domestic terminal parking lot. I repeat, the next point of contact is the airport parking lot. Hold on tight. Be careful! Look here, are you going to drag us round and round again today? That's for me to decide. Sir, I'm truly grateful that you called again. Please give Sang-woo back to us. My wife and I, we're alive, but not living. Do you really want Sang-woo back? Do you really? - What are you talking about? - Then why aren't you thinking straight? Why do I smell cops around? His temperature keeps on rising. What are you going to do? Where? Where is he hurting? - I don't want to be a bad person. - Sang-woo is sick? - So do as I say. - Hello? Sir, is our son sick? Well, I guess you are concerned. Sir, you must have children of your own, right? Please. We told you we'd do anything you want. Anyway. Then, shall we take a nice drive today? You're familiar with the 63 Building? Directions are inside the trash can in front. Set off right after you confirm them. Honey, go over there. Honey, over here! What's the Grandeur's current location? The car is currently... I'm sorry, sir. We lost it. We're on. Wait. We sent backup for the moment, go standby at the first contact point. Is there anyone who can know where the car is? Hey, trunk detail. What happened? Did the point of contact change? Don't worry about where they're going. I'm on them, so rest assured. Hello? Why do you keep making us go in circles? Let's not play games and meet in person. I'm just making sure no one tails us again. Hey, I told you, no one is following us. Why won't you believe us? Our Sang-woo... Anyway... The child is fine. I mean, how can we believe you? So what if you don't believe me? What are you going to do then? No, never mind, sir. I'm sorry. Once the money is safely with me, the child will be safely docked with you. Yes, sir. Isn't this a nice view? I thought you two could take a nice drive. Yes, we're very thankful, but please... Alright, then. Pull over. What? Where? - You know where the cable cars are? - The cable cars? - Have you two been on them before? - Cable cars? Are you kidding me? Pull over and get out of the car. Now. Leave the car running and get on the cable car. Sang-woo will be waiting for you at the top. Really? Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Thank you, sir. - What did he say? - Sang-woo is at the cable cars. - Sang-woo is there? Really? - Yes, he's there. Really? Our Sang-woo... Emergency! Contact point has changed. Get out, quick! It's the cable cars at Namsan Tower! Contact point change. The point has changed. All vehicles report to the cable cars at Namsan Tower, immediately. I repeat, report to the Namsan cable cars. Excuse me. I'm sorry. Excuse me. Excuse me. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, dear. Excuse me. Excuse me. Excuse me. Hey! Wait a sec, wait. Excuse me. Excuse me. I'm sorry. Excuse me. I'm so sorry. Excuse me. Honey. Honey, over there. That man... Wait, hold on a minute. Just wait. Honey, what do we do? What do we do? Honey, calm down. Calm down. Look, he's getting in the car. Oh no, honey. No, he's leaving. He's leaving. Did you see his face? Please let us out. Let us out. Stop the car! Calm down... Excuse me, I'm a big fan. Could I get your... I'm so sorry. He'll do it next time. Please. Next time... What do we do? That must be him. It has to be him, honey... No, it's okay. It's all gonna be okay. The detective is in the trunk and Sang-woo will be waiting at the top. We have to be calm. Be calm... He said Sang-woo is really there, right? He's there. He's there at the top. - Of course. Sang-woo is up there. - Yeah, our Sang-woo will be there. Sir, how much longer will it take to arrive? I'm so sorry, but please... What the hell were you all doing? The money's gone. What about our son? Why aren't you all out investigating? Are you just gonna sit here and wait? Mr. HAN, please... Let's try and give it a little time. Anyway, the suspect got his money, so he will bring Sang-woo back. And we've got Detective KIM on it, so everything will work out. You're smiling at me right now? You call that being 'on' it? He's a fucking hostage that's what! Stupid prick. Calls himself a cop, huh? Aren't you being too hard on him? What did you say? You're all waiting around for Detective KIM? Hurry and start a search for the car, get out there, and inspect the traffic! Look who's the detective now. - Detective CHA! - What did you say? What are you going to do now? Just because it's not your child... Imagine if he was your son! You think you would do this then? Like a miracle, like hell it is! If anything happens to our Sang-woo, I will never forgive you for it... I'll kill all of you. Get out. You too. Get out of my house. You're all goddamn worthless! Get out! You're all goddamn worthless! Get out! Mrs. HAN. Please don't do this. Sheesh, Kicked out without even shoes. What about that bum, LEE Jae-jun? Apparently, he was just going to a sauna. God, I thought we had him But we still have our men out there on stakeout. What are we doing here? By the way, what do we do about KIM? His radio is off and his pager isn't working. I think something bad has happened to him. Don't even think something like that. Let's have a little faith in him, alright? Don't worry. He'll show up. God, it's cold. Hey! Over here! Days Missing: 11 Nice and cool. Did you get the prints from the Grandeur? There was nothing there, sir. You ran over every single corner? There isn't even a single hair? No, sir. He's a real thorough bastard. Shit. We sure met our match this time. Hey, trunk detail. Don't you remember anything at all? The door just opened and this gas gun just... God, I think my ulcers are back. Listen up. Commissioner's orders. No word for twenty-four hours, and the case goes public. Till then, watch the parents and round up the suspects again. But making the case public, without even knowing if the kid is okay Then you should've done a better job. What's with the grudge toward the boy's father? Would you like it if your best friend ratted you out to the media for his own glory? He's a fucking animal inside a man's skin. How could he be human and do that to me? So you served two years and got out six months ago... Huh. What's this? Days Missing: 12 You're still up for three grand? Wow, you need a lot of money, don't you? Yes, well. It'd be nice if I had some. A need for revenge and for money... Is that why you did it? Did what? Where were you between the 18th and 22nd of June? I was flying to the country. Gangneung. I gave you proof, didn't I? You're one sick little bastard, aren't you? You saved this to give yourself an alibi, eh? You're a regular Sherlock Holmes. One lie detector test and it'll be crystal clear. Whatever you want. This is just that bastard reaping what he's sown, just dying to climb up that ladder... Ut sementem feceris, ita metes. Ut seme... Huh? What a bastard. Alright, then. Let's dig this sucker up. Next is their relationships with acquaintances. LEE Jae-jun has just been released for construction conspiracies and is being brought in for Days Missing: 13 questioning as the prime suspect. He is on very bad terms with HAN Kyung-bae. You mean the friend made the phone threats? Does that make sense? He knows his voice. It... doesn't, of course... But, would the voice really matter that much? What matters is this strong motive... Well, our scientific analysis shows that the voiceprint doesn't match up 100%. Come on. He could've gotten someone else to call. LEE Jae-jun could have a partner. We're still investigating that. Forensics is all fine and dandy, but still... You have to follow your instincts, right? Is that how a cop got kidnapped? Instincts? Come on Mr. HAN. What is this? Just hold on, Sang-woo... Don't get scared. Take it like a man. Keep it cool, son. Cool and strong. No, no. Don't try to be tough and just beg the man. Beg him to let you go, boy. Beg him to let you live. Beg him to let you live! Beg him to let you live! Days Missing: 14 Superman, the mighty prince of bravery. Batman and Robin, soldiers of justice. Wonder Woman, soaring through the sky. Aquaman, the prince of the sea. Dad, your shoulders are so tense. Does that feel better? This is a bonus. I won't take the coupon. Feel good? Ever seen a son like me? No, of course not. My son is the best... - Hello? Hello? - How have you been? Did you get the car? Hello. Where's Sang-woo? You said you'd let him go. You have the money. Are you joking? I told you not to report it. Putting your trust in the stupid cops... It's tragic how things didn't go according to your brilliant plans... I'm sorry. I'm sorry, sir. I'll give you more. I'll even sell the house. Please just give us back our son. Your fatherly love is quite impressive. Are all well-off fathers as devoted as you? Anyway... Seeing as to how desperate you are, I will give you one last chance. What? A chance? You think you're gonna get away with this? Hello? Hello, hello? You sick little motherfucker... What the hell do you want from me? Who the fuck are you? Hello? I'm so sorry, sir. I made a huge mistake. I'll give you more. Another hundred grand. Just let me hear Sang-woo's voice once. Life often demands servility, doesn't it? The all-mighty anchorman, HAN Kyung-bae... Wait. Dad, help me... Sang-woo, Sang-woo, it's Dad. - Hello? Sang-woo. - You still have a hundred grand left. This is your last chance. Yes, thank you. Thank you. I'll give you everything. Thank you, sir.

Why didn't I think of this before? One more time. Knock, and it will open. Days Missing: 16 Ten years of trunk stakeouts and now I've reached goddamn Nirvana. Long time no see. How you been? Hey, what about the free dumplings? What? Lao Xiao? When I think back, I didn't have a gun in my hand, but I still killed a lot of people. Who do you think you are? they'd say, and back then, I thought I was God. There was nothing that I couldn't do. I thought life was supposed to be like that. Pure glory. But it was all in vain. All fake. In the end, this is what I've become... God is punishing me. I have to admit, that family motto about glory was a little over the top... I hated all you cops because you sit around helplessly and wait. So I kept putting you down on purpose. Well, to be honest, it's not like we don't deserve it sometimes. But we're on this day and night, putting everyone and everything we've got into it. But he's one tough son of a bitch, real sly. Why isn't he calling back, though? You think our Sang-woo is in pain? We can't lose hope... Let's go public with the investigation. We can play his voice on the air, someone will recognize it and report him. No. That'll be the end of Sang-woo. I know you're going through hell, but... Hello? Hello? Oh, uh. We just got these today... Hello? Yes, Detective KIM. Hey, detective. How'd you know I was here? The detective lady told me where you were. But Dad, you're a big mess. Huh? No, I'm in disguise. Undercover work. It's clean underwear and some snacks. Thanks, kiddo. You know Dad, this is really cool. You have to catch him, okay? I believe in you. You got it. I'll get him no matter what. Days Missing: 17 I can't trust Sang-woo's father anymore.

Whoowhee. Now, what's all this? It's a voiceprint analyzer. Like a fingerprint, each voice has a different pattern. Do you want to try it? Good night, baby. Hi, baby. Hi, baby. Baby. Does it work even if you make your voice sound different? Well, basically, yes. No matter how hard you try to mask it, the characteristic pattern doesn't change. At least, in theory. So you should try to keep him on the phone for as long as possible. This machine will decipher his tone of speech, origin, level of education and even the street noises. It can catch all. Can I count on your full cooperation? If all things were as easy as words. Hello. Helloooo? Heeeello? How can it tell if you talk like this? Just a freaking waste of time. What the... Damn it. Hello. Uh, yes. Yes, one second. It's for you. Hello? Yes, I've heard. Hello. Which words does he use a lot? Anyway, anyways... Docking... I just, I don't know. I can't remember. What? Try to keep him on the phone? If you know how, I'd sure like to know. What? You want me to work him up? Now, you listen to me! If something happens to my son, what then?

I'm watching you... You said one eye has a double eyelid, right? Yes... Analysis shows him as male, in his early to mid-thirties, from Gyeongsang Province. About 5'11", thin physique. His has an educated voice and doesn't get worked up easily. Judging by his extremely cunning strategies, he has had higher education. We're not looking for the same face, just something that feels similar... You know, the impression. First impression. Let me see. I was busy making the seal... A lid. Try putting a lid on him. Right, a cap. A cap... - What do you think? - It looks similar. Do you really want to save him? It hurts, so don't shout. What is this about? I'm HAN In-seok. No, I don't have the money to buy land.
