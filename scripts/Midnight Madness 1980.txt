Just keep at it. Sit on the teacher's desk | and camp out on his porch. Do whatever you have to. No. I couldn't do that. Look. Flynch. | I know you can do it. [Knock on door] -Adam Larson? | -Yeah? We've been asked to deliver this | to you at this time. Who's it from? He prefers to remain | anonymous at this time. [Giggling] Hi. Won't you come in? What is this? [Crunching] What does this mean? The most challenging | adventure of my life? Please be seated. And we'll get started. [Music playing] Since the dawn of time... and intellectual stimulation... in the form of games. improved and perfected countless varieties of games. a major breakthrough until tonight. to participate in this glorious event. to meet the person... all of this possible. [Fanfare plays] ALL: Leon? Please! Hold your applause. Allow me to explain why | I've gathered you all here. The five of you are invited-- | more accurately. Challenged-- to compete | in my latest creation-- The Ultimate Game... which I call | The Great All-Nighter. as a team captain... to participate in the game... in the following manner-- Sunshine? LEON: At the onset... a complicated clue... will lead them... somewhere in the city. its skill and wit... to obtain the next clue. to the next location... and so forth. The game will begin | Friday at sunset... and continue | on through the night... until one team | is the first to arrive... at a final location. | the finish line. will receive a trophy... and, more importantly. | prove to the other teams... that theirs | is the best group of all. Whew. Well, I'll see you all Friday. Are there any questions? [All laugh] DONNA: I can't believe this. | I can't believe that I sat... WESLEY: I've had enough of this. | I'm getting out of here. [All chattering] -We wasted a Thursday evening. | -This whole thing is silly! [Door slams] Oh, Leon. You poor thing. | After all that work... They're not interested. | They won't to play your game. Girls, do you think... I would've spent a year | designing this game... without taking every possibility | into account? Those five team captains | were selected... after months | of careful research. Believe me, by Friday night... every one of them | will be dying to play. [Snorts] And furthermore. | this frivolous pastime... is designed | for mindless apes to play. And then there is | the question as to whether... football players belong | in an academic institution... in the first place. Let us be frank. | It is certainly no secret... that these mentally deficient. | giant, uncivilized vulgarians... care nothing | about the nobler pursuits... such as art, music. | and library science. I think I've made | myself quite clear. And if there are any comments | from the audience... Just feel free | to toss them right up here. [Shouting] Who threw that? [Microphone feeds back] [Players shouting and laughing] Hey! You see? This is just what | I was talking about! [Classical music playing] [Indistinct chattering] Napkin. Here, take that one. I want to get rid of mine. | You take that one. You got a full plate. Berle, I think we'll finally | have more than four members... if we can just pull this off. [Screaming] ALL: Let's party! [Yelling and cheering] [Screaming] Lavitus, that's it! | I'll get even with you! No! Don't leave! Lavitus. | that's the last straw! I was going to camp out | on the teacher's porch... but my mother said the night air | would be bad for my asthma. [Puff, puff] I can never do anything. Aw, look. Flynch... is there anything else | bothering you... besides schoolwork? | You can tell me. Well, yeah. I guess so. This is kind of hard | for me to talk about. Well, it's about girls. Here it is, | my first year in college... and I...well... Flynch, are you trying | to tell me... that you're, | well, you know, a virgin? Oh, no. | That is, not exactly. You see. | I've never had a date. Look, Flynch... you could be | a regular Burt Reynolds. No, I can tell. | You've got that look about you. You go out and | get yourself a date... and I guarantee your schoolwork | will improve, too. Gee, I don't know. Come on, Flynch. | you can do it. You stand up and face life. You go for the gusto. Remember, never walk away | from a challenge. And when it comes to women. | there's nothing to it. You just be confident. [Chuckles] Hi! Adam. Hi! Laura. Adam, I've been meaning to | talk to you about something. How long have | we been working together? Oh, heh. I don't know. Five or six weeks. And in all that time. | I think you've been doing... a really terrific job | as a counselor. But what I want to know is... why don't you follow | your own advice? What are you talking about? I'm talking about Leon's game. | The Great All-Nighter. It sounds like fun. | Why don't you do it? I don't know. | I've been pretty busy. Adam, are you really | that busy... you just won't do well? What about going for the gusto? What about never | walking away from a challenge? If you really believe all that. | why don't you prove it? If not, it would be | like letting down... all the freshmen | you've ever advised. Hey, what am I doing | sitting around here? The game's only three days away. I gotta get transportation. | get up a team, and... [Dramatic music playing] I thought you'd never ask. [Laughing] [Vase rattles] [Snickering] Harold, | stop stuffing yourself! You don't need all that. Lucille! [Rattling] Rosita! Rosita! Accidento! | Cleano up-a messo. OK? [Muttering] Harold! Stop teasing the maid | and get in there! I want to talk to you! Whoa. [Laughing] [Slam] Harold, you lazy slob. | you never do anything. Why don't you get off | your lazy butt and do something? But, Dad... Come on. I want you to enter... you hear me? But, Dad... Don't "But, Dad" me! [Muffled giggling] You know. | Bill Larson's boy Adam... is going to be competing | in the game... and I don't want you | upstaged by him again. Why, that boy-- Harold, look at me | when I'm talking to you! Adam is such a successful | enterprising young man! Why can't you be more like him? Dad, I'm not Adam. Why don't you just | look at me for what I am? Yuck. Now, you're entering | Leon's game and that's final! But, Dad! No, thanks. Adam. I was planning to work | on my jeep all weekend. That's OK, Marvin. I mean. | now that I think of it... we need to find someone | with a really hot car. Hey! What do you mean? What do you call this? Oh, your Jeep? I'm sure it was all right | in its day... but I don't know. My jeep can outclass | any new car on the road! Pick you up on Friday at 5:00. And not only that... but the game's a perfect chance | to get back at Adam. Goody-good. It's because of him | that my dad's always on my case. Sounds good... but what makes you so sure | we can win? [Click] [Harp playing] [Fanfare] Just a little present | from my father. [Lucille squeals] [Opener clanks] Oh! It's got | a turbo-charged engine... observation bubble, telephone... everything we need. And best of all, | this baby right here! Solve any clue | in five seconds flat. Your dad bought you | all this stuff? Boy, if you don't win that game. | he's gonna kill you. Don't worry! We'll win! You guys just meet me here | Friday night. And in conclusion, this can be | our chance to finally show... those football gorillas | how real men compete! Wesley is right! Especially after what those guys | did to us at the debate! -All in favor? | -Aye! Motion carried! [Bang] [Glugging] [Gasps] [Belches] I don't know, Lavitus. I think we have better things | to do on a Friday night. [Belches] Yeah. Just why the hell | should we bother? [Belches] Well, gentlemen. | I'll give you one good reason. What a nerd! ALL: We're in! [Laughing] And that's why | we've got to enter that game! If Lavitus and his animals | decide to play... I want to be there | and beat them! Oh, count me in! I'd like to get back | at those moron jocks! Right! Peggy and Lulu. | how about you? [Giggling] [Door rattles] What you doing, Harold? Ah, Lucille has an idea | I'm supposed to be... on a new diet | starting tomorrow. Oh. An all-marshmallow diet? Come on, Melio. You know I can't go | all night without food. [Sighs] Just need an emergency stash. | that's all. [Grunting] [Sighs] Come on, Melio. | Give me a break, huh? Don't tell Lucille. My lips are sealed. Well, buddy... [Yawns] | Getting kind of late. -Oh, yeah. | -Mmm. I think you should go home. I mean. | thanks for stopping by. -Sweet dreams. | -Thanks. [Bag rustles] [Slam] Yeah. Bye-bye. Marvin'll pick us up | at your house in half an hour. Come on, let's go! Yeah, but, you know. | having four or five people... on our team | would be a lot better. I just wish we could | find one more guy. FLYNCH: Adam! You'll never believe it! | I finally got a date. She's right outside the door. Hey, no kidding, Don Juan. | That's great. Did you get the date | all by yourself? Not exactly. | My mother fixed me up. Terrific. Super, Flynch. | but we got to get going. I just stopped by to see | if you had any ideas... of where | we might be able to go. [Door squeaks] You're coming with us. | Come on! But what about my date? Believe me, Flynch. | you'll thank us in the morning. LAURA: Yeah! Now that we're all here. | we can begin. Candy and Sunshine and I | will be running the game... from my apartment. | henceforth to be known... as "Game Control." We'll be plotting | your progress on the game map. You must phone in | from each clue location... so that we can keep track of you | at all times. [Beeps] It is now sunset. Candy and Sunshine | will distribute the first clue. [Low muttering] LEON:: "The sea is reversed: and blind: "38-22-23/56-10-11." Well, teams, good luck. I'll see you at the finish line. Wherever that may be. [Laughs] All right, men, huddle up. OK. Blaylak, Cudzo. | Gerber. Armpit... we've always been the best | offensive line there is... and tonight we're going | to uphold that tradition. Because who are we? M-e-a-t M-a-c-h-i-n-e! Meat Machine! Meat Machine! All right, break! All right, men, let's go! ALL: Right! DONNA: | Come on! Get in, get in! Figure out that clue! | Get in! [Twins giggling] Come on, we'd better go. Hey, wait a second. | Flynch! Hey, come on, Flynch. But my mother's | going to kill me. -Will you come on? | -Flynch! [Cheering and shouting] [Tires screech] Let's take this clue | one piece at a time. What's the first sentence? FLYNCH: | "The sea is reversed." Well, OK, that could be | the ocean or the beach. But it says the sea is reversed. Maybe that means we should | go away from the beach. [Sighs] Tch. I've got it! I've got it! "The sea is reversed"... means to take the words | "the sea" and reverse them. That way you get... "Sea the!" Yeah, but what's | the second part of the clue? "S.S. Itari | is mixed up and blind." -Huh. | -Mr. Chairman... regarding the portion | "S.S. Itari is mixed up"... I move that mixed up means | the letters in the word... "S.S. Itari" are scrambled up. Very good. | but the clue says... "S.S. Itari | is mixed up and blind." What does he mean by blind? Well, that's the simple part. Blind means to... To take out its eyes. | "I's!" You get it? -You get it? | -Yeah! [Squealing] There are two I's | in the word "S.S. Itari." Take the I's out! | Take the I's out! She's right! | That leaves s-s-t-a-r. And that unscrambles | to form the word... Uh, stars? You're right! -Yeah! | -Hurrah! Blaylak, way to go! Put everything together. | the clue reads... "Sea the stars." And there's only | one place I know... you can see | every star there is! The Wax Museum! A map to the stars' homes! The stars on | Hollywood Boulevard! The Stargate Disco! [Tires screeching] [Horns honking] Let's go! are way ahead of us! What are you waiting for? [Beeping] [Beeping] [Yawns] [Clatters] Well, I suppose | we may as well get going. We don't want to make it | too late of a night, do we? [Laughing] Let's see... [Beeping] Now, watch this. [Beeps] [Typing] forecast for all of... RADIO: 6L-15... for Los Angeles 6:00 report. a serious accident... and several smaller vehicles... blocking the freeway... [Static squeals] [Voices overlapping] A-ha! [Slams] I thought | it was coming from here. [Noise stops] When all of my tenants | started to complain... I knew it had to be you... you...you...student! Now. Mrs. Grimhouse. I-- Don't give me any of | your fast college talk, buster. I'm sick to death | of your mess and your noise. You know what I have here? Your eviction papers. And I intend to use them... if I hear | one more complaint about you. So you just better | watch your step. LEON: Hey! You...you...pervert! [Slams] Hey, you know. | maybe the numbers are addresses. LAURA: The names | are numbered on this map. Maybe it means | longitude and latitude. LAURA: Oh, come on. ADAM: This is a little map. | It's just the streets here. I don't see any longitude. FLYNCH: Yeah, but why don't | we try La Cienega? [Crickets chirping] Hey, Armpit! What were those numbers | on that clue again? Armpit! 36, 37, 38! Let's see, this started exactly | 38 feet from the corner... it's the 22nd from the east | and the 23rd from the west. You guys think | that means anything? Perhaps it's in code. 4, 5, 6, 7, 8... -Say... | -9, 10... Eleven! Hey. | how'd you like to--Ooh! [Screaming] Where were we? I don't know, I lost count. I wonder if Peggy and Lulu | are having any better luck. [Clapping] What can I say? I need someone new afraid to love me to the stars above me will come along But it's you, baby who... This is Hanrold. Just thought | I'd let you know... that I already solved | your difficult clue. We're already | at the Observatory. Game's too easy, Leon. in about an hour. [Hangs up] [Radios overlapping] [Beeps] Well, sure is | a clear night anyway. You can even see the stars. What did you say? I said you can | even see the star-- Hey, that's it! the wrong kinds of stars! Ha ha ha! [Tires squeal] Marvin, you sure those numbers | are telescope settings? Yeah, but | where's the telescope? Hey, you guys, look! | In the periscope! ADAM: Aw, great. Come on, you guys. | over here! There it is. Excuse me, but do you mind... if I take a quick peek | through there? No way, Jos! | I was here first. [Sighs] I'm sorry. | but this is very important. Dad! What's the matter with you? | My kid's studying Venus. It's for his term paper. [Music playing] [Shouting] Come on, keep looking. That clue's got to be | around here someplace. If I'm lucky, I may be able to | get a view of Venus' two moons. [Shouting echoing] They're getting closer! Come on, guys. | Let's check out that other room. Hey, Lavitus! Come take a look | at this thing, will you? Hey, Armpit, be careful! I am being careful, OK? [Glass breaks] Hey, Einstein. | Isn't Venus over there? Well, son, you want | to let me have a look? Dad, let's go look | at the magnetic exhibit. Magnetic exhibit. | [Sighs] Hey, Flynch, remind me | to bring you back here... when we have more time. Marvin, would you turn this | to the right setting? OK, go ahead. Now, 22-43-68. ADAM: Easy. Easy now. Hey, I found it! "To unlock the next clue... "find the 8800 keys!" -Hey, all right! | -Ha ha ha! [Banging] Hey, what are you doing | with that telescope? Telescope? Oh, this? Don't waste your time, you guys. We've already checked out | everything in this room. Yeah. Listen, why don't you | go check downstairs? -And we'll meet you-- | -I got a better idea. Why don't you guys | go check downstairs? OK. Lavitus, if you insist. After you, Marvin. [Laughing] [Telescope whirs] Who do you think | you're dealing with here? Out of here! Meet you down there. | See you downstairs. Go! Go! This is it! [Talking and laughing] of these things before. This here's big, isn't it? You see the moon? [Music playing] Hey, Lavitus, what is it? Lavitus? [Telephone rings] Hello? Game Control. -Hi. Donna! | -There! Thanks, Leon, the Red Team's | at the Observatory. [Knock on door] I'll get it. [Banging] [Radios blaring] Leon. | we can hardly hear the TV... with all the noise | that's coming from up here! Just what's going on? Mr. Thorpe! I'm very sorry | about all the noise. Won't you come in? [Radios blaring] Welcome to Game Control. I don't know what this is. | but you'd better-- Look! A strategy board! Wally, Edna, it's just like | I was telling you! During the war, when | I worked for the government... I worked on the strategy board. Leon, what is going on? At this very moment, | there are five teams... [Laughing] what are you doing? Harold! Mmf! Harold, are you eating? Are you sure you don't have | any food in there? Come on! You know Lucille | just can't wait... for her wittle Harold to | lose his wittle spare tire. Then maybe this summer... Harold can take his shirt | off at the beach! Huh? [Laughing] Hey, Harold. | look what Melio can do! La-la-la-la! Would you idiots get up and | help me find the stupid clue? Hey, Adam, doesn't that kid | look like your brother? That is my brother! Hey! Hey, Scott. | what are you doing out here? Trying to get me in trouble? It's a good thing Mom and Dad | are still out of town. They'd really be mad at me | if they knew you were out here. I'm responsible for you. San Francisco? [Jeep honks] If I weren't right in | the middle of something... I'd take you back home | this minute. But for now, you'll just have | to come along with us! [Sobs] Where the hell is the clue? [Crying] [Playing piano] [Organ plays] [Music swells] [Harpsichord plays] I found the clue! [Music stops] Well, what's it say? This note's an "A"... that's a "B." Then there's | an A-A-G-F-E-F-E-E! Oh! It's all scrambled up. What's it mean, honeybuns? How should I know? That's why my dad | gave me a computer! [Tires squealing] [Shouting] Oof! Oh! Excuse me, Adam. | My hand must have slipped. Ha ha ha! [Players yelling] Come on, we'd better hurry! Aren't you coming, Scott? This game is stupid. Who cares about it anyway? E...F...E...E. [Static] There. [Clicking] There. [Banging] There! There! There! -Gimme that! | -Aah! Harold! -Harold! | -Ow! [Low conversations] Hey. guys! Look!

[Laughing] Pabst Blue Ribbon Ohhh Pabst Blue Ribbon It's beautiful. Ohhh Ohh Come on, guys. Let's go. Whoo! It's getting cold. Adam, are you sure minors | are allowed in there? Flynch, sometimes | I don't believe you. Are you going to be like this | all your life? The only way to get anywhere | in life is to have confidence. So, come on, let's go in there | and win this game. Right! -Ha ha! | -Yeah! [Giggling] Yeah! There's fun stuff! And eating! [Giggling] BOTH: Ooh! Oh, no, there they go! [Sighs] That's it! | This is the last time... we're going through this | with the two of them! Harold, how long do you | intend to keep driving around... without knowing | where we're going? Barf, have you unscrambled | those letters yet? Faga beefe? Faga beefe. | [Laughs] Melio, faga-- Shut up! Ladies and gentlemen. | welcome to the cool... refreshing world | of Pabst Blue Ribbon beer. and follow me, please. in the brewing process... Beer! [Rattling] Come on.

Excuse me, Officer...Palmer. I'm sure | we can work this out. You see, | that's my little brother. -Oof! | -Ow! Well, Scott. | I hope you're satisfied. Now we'll never find the clue.

[Muzak playing] "Look between | the two giant melons." Damn you, Leon! What I want to know... is what does Leon mean | by "two giant melons"? [Sighs] Now, let's go | over this one more time. He said. "Look between | the two giant--" I got a feeling | we're overlooking something. What could | the two giant melons be? [Dishes clatter] Oh, miss? | Can we have some more coffee? Miss! There's a cockroach | in my water! [Crash] Miss? | We had a little accident. Oh, miss? -Miss? | -Miss? Miss! Aah! -Oh! | -Oh! Whoo-hoo! [Splash] -The necklace! | -Yeah! [Shouting] Hurry!

What's the one place | in this city... that has a giant huge "M"? Wait a minute! There's a huge letter | "M" on the top... of the sign at | Miniature Golf World! -That's it! | -Ha ha ha! I can't believe it! We got | all of that from "Hug me." We'd better get going. No...no! Not my poor tires! [Sobbing] Who would do | such a rotten thing? [Van rumbling] [Screech] Oh, my! What have we here? Four flat tires? Ohh, how unfortunate. Hope this doesn't put you | out of the game. Harold, you beached whale... [Gasps] Oh, my goodness! Are we losing our temper? Ha ha ha! [Tires squeal] [Horn honks] Adam, you all right? Who, me? I never felt better. OK, now we can't let them | get away with this. What we need is a plan. We'll split up. Marvin, go find a phone. | You call the Auto Club. Flynch, you and I | will try to hitch a ride... -to Miniature Golf World. | -Right! Laura, will you watch the Jeep | until Marvin gets back? Sure.

Scott! [Barking] How you doing? Come on. [Sighs] Hey. Some people are so mean. How could they | lock him up like this? It's the pits. You shouldn't have | disappeared like that. You really had me worried. Your brother, too. My brother? | Huh. Tell me about it. Scott, Adam cares about you. Yeah, sure he does. He doesn't even know I exist. Forgot all about my birthday.
