We said we would keep her safe if you came in today. - What does that even mean? - And I can give you my word... What does that... ...she is safe, even happy. I... She's not happy. Where is she? Let me tell you about identicals. No! Where is she? Let me tell you about identicals. Stop! Stop! Stop! What the fuck are you talking about? Small things change lives. It's a small thing. What's a small thing? They didn't know you were gonna be there. If all had gone well, if she had opened the door and not you, well, you'd now be happily living with a new Nadia. Yeah, okay, so there's a new Nadia. Do you... Do you hear what I'm trying to say? I don't... I don't want a new Nadia, I didn't want a new Nadia. I want to know where my Nadia is. Please. Please just tell me you have my Nadia. Two Nadias in the same life space, that's just not possible. You have the dead Nadia now. What the fuck is a life space? You have the dead Nadia now. My girlfriend is not dead! Police have identified the body of a young woman found at the house in this street as Nadia Seville. They're also searching for a man believed to be her boyfriend. His name's Slater Brenner. We've spoken to neighbors here in the street, they said they heard the sound of a struggle earlier this morning. Police are treating this as suspicious and asked anybody with information to contact them in the incident room. The number is 08081570570. Live at the scene, I'm Anthony Davis. Back to you. That's... That's not my girlfriend. We believe your story. We're trying to help you. I didn't do anything! I didn't do anything. Let me tell you about identicals. You just met one tonight, briefly. That's not my girlfriend, that's... Let me explain our core service. We help customers look for that person who looks like them, talks like them, walks like them. Identicals. Identicals, but who are walking through a more enjoyable, better life situation, and then we support our customers in the acquisition of that better life. Okay. What the fuck are you talking about? Yes, I know. No. What the fuck are you talking about? Yes, I understand. These are difficult concepts, but try and listen. Nadia took a new life, Slater, she's already moved forward without looking back. You now have a dead Nadia in your life space. Okay. You will only ever have a dead Nadia in this life space. We can't roll back time. You can't roll back time, yeah. But we can try and help you. You could let me profile you, help you to move forward. Identity cleanse. You could find love again. And what if I don't want to do that? Then you'll have to take your chances. Nobody will believe you, and you will be found guilty. And... And will I find her? Will I find her? You'll find everyone you truly need. Take nothing with you, that's the rule. You don't have to make a choice yet, let me just profile you. Just to see if our program will work for you. I'll leave you to think it over. Police have identified the body of a young woman found at the house in this street as Nadia Seville. They're also searching for a man believed to be her boyfriend.

Now, this is a very easy test. I make a statement and you say yes or no, based on whether you believe that statement applies to you. Remember there is no right answer, only what is right for you. Okay? Okay. I want to repeat that. Remember there is no right answer, only what is right for you. Okay? Okay. I want to repeat that. Remember there is no right answer, only what is right for you. Okay? Okay. I'm being followed. Yes. I'm not afraid of fire. Yes. I don't mind meeting strangers. Yes. I like hurting animals. No. I fall asleep easily. No. Are you sure? Yes. I fall asleep easily. No. Easily I fall asleep. No. Easily I fall in love. No. I fall in love quickly. No. Are you sure? Easily I fall asleep. No. Maybe if you fell in love more easily you'd sleep better. I fall asleep easily. Yes. Easily I fall in love. Um... Easily I fall in love. I fall in love quickly. You are totally alone, Slater. Help me! You are totally alone. We are your only friends now.

We've carefully designed this life to match your profile and you must embrace it. We select what you need, not what you want. Slater. Good to see you. You well? Come on. Let's go. Doesn't it make you wanna jump sometimes? God, yeah. You? I'll see you tomorrow. Hey, hey! Excuse me. Sorry, I... Sorry. This stuff is a wonder of fucking technology. Look, Mephedrone, 4-MMMC with an added molecule, it's totally legal. - Bunny hop. - What? That's what it's called. But what I'm saying is, life is just maths, isn't it? Life is just maths if you're a total fucking geek, like you, Joe. All right, close your eyes. Close your eyes. All right, open your eyes. Let's say you've got a one-in-four chance of getting your head blown off, okay? Choose one of the cans, open it next to your head. Ooh! Ooh! What the fuck? What? I was just being friendly. Choosers can't be beggars. Beggars can't be chooser, you fucking... You know, you're very attractive. Thank you. But I don't really go for guys. I'm more into women. Really? Are you sure? Yeah, I'm sure, what the fuck's that supposed to mean? That's not what it says in your profile. There's a health risk involved. - Got an elevated sense of stupidity... - What? For a starter. Being around Joe brings out your mean streak, you do know that? What? That's why I like him. Oh, shit, sorry, that was... That was inappropriate. You mean you're not my friend? Fuck. You're just some creepy check-up? Get out. - What? - Get out. - What, is this a joke? - Get the fuck out now! Okay, we're going. You're out of line. You're a real jerk-off, you know? I am your friend. And yes, I'm here to look up on you, but... What, you think they're just gonna let their new lifers sink or swim? They care whether you make it or not, you know. I'm just here to look for signs that you need a little help. For example, you have a new picture. No, that's, uh... That's always been... No, no, it's new. Or worse, this is old. - You can't have that. Please. - You don't need this. Let her go, Slater. There are rules, you know that. You're looking in the wrong direction, and that always makes things complicated. Excuse me, excuse me. Hey, sorry. Hey. Do I know you? Uh... Well, actually, do I know you? I feel like I've seen your face before. This is a guest announcement. We will be closing in 10 minutes. I should go catch a train. No. It was nice, really. We're closing. - I had fun, really. - Really? It was nice. That's a lie, it was great, it was amazing. It was. It was. Hmm. Don't you ever get a feeling we've known each other for... At least longer than an evening? Yeah. It's a strange feeling, isn't it? Mmm. It's beautiful, right? Yeah. I've been looking for you. What do you mean? I just mean, um... I'm really glad you're here. I'm glad, too. This is a guest announcement... Better get going. We will be closing in 10 minutes. We hope you enjoyed your visit. Have a safe journey home. Thanks. Good night. Good night. See you. Bye. This is a guest announcement. We will be closing in 10 minutes. We hope you enjoyed your visit. Have a safe journey home. Not nice. You're looking in the wrong direction. Always makes life difficult. ...always love you. Follow your heart... Fall into place. You just have to trust me. - Hello? - Uh... I, uh... I'm really sorry for ringing, I, uh... Hmm. You see, I, uh... I was attacked and they... They knew we'd seen each other, they knew we'd been together. Jesus. So I was just ringing to see if you were okay. Are you okay? Jesus, who did this to you? I don't know. I don't know. I didn't recognize them. Hey, you know, I'd seen you before. - Yeah? - Yeah. It's okay. Um... I've, uh... I've also been dreaming about you. Um... I dreamt I was looking for you, and... I was... You needed me. Yeah. And I reached this door and, um... And you, uh... I was convinced you were behind me. So, uh... Hmm. Thank you, uh... Thanks for coming. It's okay. Ah. Sorry. Just... This is weird. Can I see? It's a photo of me with an old boyfriend. I think I remember that day, it was his birthday. Scratched-out face, that's me. No, no, I know who this is and it's not you. I, uh... I share that memory. That's, uh... That's me. No, no, I know who this is and it wasn't you. Scratched-out face, that's me. I have had a life before you. I share that memory. Here you go. Hey. Hello. It's late. What are you doing? I'm, uh... Sticking this photograph together because... Well, because... Because... There's a better life waiting for us. Somebody else. Somewhere else. Doors opening. Doors closing. Merry Christmas, kids! Nice to see a couple of happy lovebirds at Christmas. Your, uh, quarrel, you get over that? Sorry? Not good to let a photograph come between you. I mean, you're in enough trouble as it is. Third floor. Doors opening. Hand over the image. I can explain. Hey! What were you told? What? Nothing. To bring nothing. What do you think nothing means? Photographs? Memories? Obsessions? No. Let's not get into a conflict, okay? She doesn't feel like we shared history, she still doesn't feel like that, so it's not a problem. - We don't agree. - No, we don't agree. Oh, my God, this is not real, this cannot be happening. You're looking in the wrong direction. Always makes life difficult. Stop the car and let her out. This is between you and me, please, just let her go. I'm sorry, Slater, but she's with me now. What? No! You'll get used to it, you need to move on. No, Slater. This has nothing to do with her. This has everything to do with her. No! What? Please. Just let her go. We're calling in the loan on your current life. You can move on. Do the whole thing again, but do it right. This time you're gonna have to eliminate the life donor yourself. I'm not gonna kill anyone, all right? - What? - There'll be a body. Your options are not what they were. Dump him in a reservoir, shove him in a freezer. You're not the first person to have these problems, you know? People cope. Yeah, people cope, we just do the best we can. - Let me out of the car! - Get the fuck down! Hey, hey, hey! At me! At me! It's time to step up to the line. Prove that all that help you've been getting is worth it. Slater, please don't let them take me. You're not gonna do that. Get out of the fucking car. Get out the fucking car now! Get out the car. No! Fuck you! Hello, you are speaking to Janet. I need to ask you some security questions. Please answer "yes" or "no". I'm being followed. Yes. Yes. Someone has it in for me. Yes. I've not lived the right kind of life. No. No. I wake up fresh and rested most mornings. No. Me. I'm liked by most people who know me. No. Hello, Slater. Hey. Hey, hey. Listen, there's been a mistake, okay? A fucking mistake. You must sort out the user problems, whatever they might be, at your current level, and within that level alone. You need to fix this! I want to repeat that. You must sort out the user problems, whatever they might be, at your current level, and within that level alone. Backwards flow in the system could cause errors. Backwards flow? What the fuck are you... What errors are you... What the fuck are you talking about? Abuse or profanity will result in your call being terminated, Slater. Okay, I want to talk to your boss. I want to talk to your fucking boss, I wanna make my point - and I want to be heard! - ...calling, sir. What the fuck is your name? Tell me your name. My name's Janet. You can call back and ask for me any time. Okay, Janet. Yes, Slater? What's your family name, Janet? My family name is Phone 068. 068? What the fuck is that supposed to mean? Unfortunately, this call will be terminated due to user profanity. This is the Janet phone, so you see... ...you will always be able to contact me when you need support. - Okay. Fuck you! - Goodbye, Slater. Hello, Slater. You need to make a life space adjustment. You need to make a life space adjustment. Now, Slater, are you listening? There's a car waiting on level two. There's a car waiting on level two. You need to go. - Brand New-U. - Brand New-U. Brand New-U. Congratulations on your new life space. The boarding pass is in your glove compartment, along with everything you need for your new life space. Good luck in your new life space. We wish you every happiness in your new life space. Hello. I've been told by mutual friends that you're in need of support. Come in. Guns. I can see you're gonna take to this like a duck to water. Yeah. The Ruger Mark II, silent .22 caliber weapon. Popular with special forces the world over for its reliability, its stealthiness, and accuracy up to 70 yards. That weapon has seen action with US Navy SEAL teams. You see, the thing about the .22 caliber weapons is it's possible to really silence them effectively. They don't have... ...the crack that you get with a .38. Oh, and it's best not to point it at people that you don't wanna kill. Sorry. It is a pistol, not a novelty cigarette lighter. Yeah. Guns make me nervous. Yeah. Firearms make everybody nervous. That is the point of them. And by the way, we don't like to call them guns. We say rifles or pistols, generally the word is "weapon." - Weapon. - Weapon. This is what we have put aside for you. - Christ. - Yeah. Okay, this is the Heckler & Koch PSG1 Prazisionsschutzengewehr. It's basically a totally reworked G3 for precision sniping. It is a beautiful rifle. It's heavy duty, extra long barrel, polygonal rifled bore, so, well, have a go. She really is a beauty. The, uh, scope there is six by 24, with illuminated crosshairs. That should hold accurate to about 600 meters, far longer than you'll need in an urban context. Yeah, it's a good choice. Who's paying for all this? They say we have benefactors. They say where there's faith, there's generosity. Generosity? Whose generosity is that? Powerful people who believe that humanity can still evolve. Let me give you this. The Baby Desert Eagle, here's a handy little thing. Okay, use it, leave it, I will collect it. Here is the phone, and you know the drill. Yeah. One number. So, when do I call? When you want to. Follow your heart, it'll all fall into place. So. Hello. Have you come for me or her? That's a bit of a difficult question. Yes. It is. Well, maybe it's time you decided. Are you okay? I've been waiting for you. Waiting? What do you mean? I just mean... I'm glad you found me. Yeah. Um, I'm glad, too. I had a dream about you. I needed you. I reached a door. I was convinced you were behind it. If I could just open it, I'd find you. Are you okay? And did you? I don't know. He's been expecting you. But you know that better than anyone. After all, it's as if we all know each other. Yeah. It's a strange feeling, isn't it? It's a beautiful thing. I had a dream about you. I needed you. And then, I reached a door. You have my photograph. And if I could just open it... I'd find you. I know why you've come. And you and the other versions of you? God knows. Maybe they're struggling along. Maybe they're dead. I don't need to worry about them right now. They're very unaware people. They don't understand like you and me do. Don't you ever want to be me when we're fucking? Melt into a perfect version of you and me. Can you... Look at me. So... Will I make it? Hello. Don't you wanna know who I am? I know who you are. I know who you are. I know who you are. I know who you are. I know who you are. Oh, um, killing you will hurt me a little, but I am prepared. I am so, so prepared. We don't have to do this. Uh... Oh, yes, I do. And you know what? Hmm. I seem to have the edge here. Oh. You don't have to do this. Please don't do this. Can you be the strongest Slater? Can you be the strongest Slater? ...strongest Slater? Can you be the strongest Slater? Can you be the strongest Slater? Help me. There's a better life waiting for us. Can you be the strongest Slater? Help me. - Somebody else. - Can you be the strongest Slater? Somewhere else. Can you be the strongest Slater? Can you be the strongest Slater? There's a better life.
