Whenever you can. Good morning. How's Sachi? I don't think she slept last night... You would have been better just staying out today. Nah, it'll be smooth sailing. Smooth sailing? I'm trying to speak like an adult. Good luck! You're late! Why are you never there during critical time? You hear me, right? I hear you. Chika! You haven't slept enought!? In Yamagata? Yeah, he worked in a spa hotel. A spa hotel? Like in a bad mystery drama... "In a little-known spring... A murder is committed!" No one was murdered... That woman.... She's the one who called? No, I heard she died a while ago. Chika, don't eat like a pig. ...After that, he remarried and moved to Yamagata. Three differents wives? Not bad... You're gonna get hypertension, like grandma. But you didn't add any salt. Yes, that's on purpose... I heard he had a daughter. So... she's our little sister? Seems like it. And the funeral? I'm not going. I have the night shift. Really? You won't attend? You could go in my place? ...Chika will accompany you. This feels weird. I haven't seen dad in 15 years. He was nice, right? He was taking us to the zoo and stuff. But him and mom also used to fight a lot. I can't count how many times I saw Sachi consolling her... Yeah, I don't remember any of that. You were still little. A little sister... You always said you wanted one. Back when I was a kid! It's bit late, now... You don't say... Wow, what a racket. What?! We're in the middle of nowhere! Are you the Kda family? I am Suzu Asano. That means... Thanks for traveling such a distance. It goes uphill a bit, but it's a shortcut. That's a big hill... Right. Ah, wait up. Over there. Over there! Wow, look at that! Right?! We're here. Welcome. You must be tired! It's no problem, really. Thanks for letting us stay here. My stepmother will come to greet you, a bit later. Thank you!... For picking us up. Thanks. -What a mature kid! -More than us, at least. Your room is ready. Ahh! The air con. Beer!... -Woh! Look at the view! -I need beer... Yoshi, the river's right below! maybe we can fish. I want a river of beer... Yko, you're alright? Calm down. He has been very kind to us. You managed to come? You finished your shift? A friend drove me here. Is she?... Nice to meet you. I'm Sachi Kda. I'm Suzu Asano. He's your brother? Yes. Well... he's my stepmother's son. I see. Excuse us. Nice to meet you. I am Sachi Kda. Ah. You're the eldest daughter? Yes. Nice to meet you. I am Mrs Kda. Thank you for taking time out of your busy schedule to come. You have done a lot for my father. He has done so much for me and the kids! It's almost time to go out with the ashes. If the widow wants to say a few words... Yko? Can you do it? I can't... Can you do it, uncle? Hmm. It's not easy, you know... Maybe... Suzu could do it? Ohh. Yes! Plus, you're his real daughter. She can't! But... Suzu's a really mature kid. She can do it! She's really smart. That's not it. This is the duty of an adult. Do you want me to take care of it? It's only a few words, right? It is... I'll do it. You'll be okay, Yko? I will. I am his wife. Ah, look! The smoke! Ah. You're right. Feels like a grand funeral. Feels like an old funeral... Daddy would be happy. A lot of people came today. Everyone said he was a kind man. A kind man but a loser. He'd vouch for a friend, just to cash in on the debt. The sooner he'd show sympathy for a girl, the sooner he'd try to get in her pants. It seems dad liked that kind of woman. That Yko was just like our mother. Still, she took care of dad until the end. We should be grateful. You're right. She probably never stayed with dad at the hospital. 10 minutes, at most. She'd bring new clothes, then she was gone. And yet, she's probably convinced she was taking care of him. You're a nurse alright... Excuse me! What's the matter? I have something for you. Here. Dad was keeping it in his desk. Ah! Is that you, sis? That was at the fireworks festival. In Kamakura. Ah! I remember that! Enoshima island! That's when you got lost. Everyone was worried sick. You even took a poop at the station! Is that true? Well then... Wait! Do you have time? Yes. What's your favorite place in this town? She'll be alright? I mean... I think she can take care of herself. She's the complete opposite of Yko, that's for sure. Look at the view! I came here often, with dad. Hey... Reminds you of somewhere? Yeah! With the sea, it'd be just like Kamakura! Right? Feels like home... Suzu. You're the one who took care of dad, right? He must have been very happy. Thank you. Truly. Thank you. Thanks. You like it here? Well... I haven't been here for long. Right... You know... I was wondering why dad wanted to live here... I understand, now. It's here! See ya! Take care! I will. You too, sisters. Suzu... You wanna come to Kamakura? The four of us, living together! Our house is pretty old, but it's big. We all have jobs. We can raise you. But... You don't have to answer now. Think about it. See you soon. I'll come! Big sis, we're here! Ah! Watch out. Welcome! That's a long way. Are you tired? I'm fine. Your room's on the second floor. You can unpack there. Yes. We're neighbors. From now on, you can count on me. Follow me! Here, here. -Yoshino, help me with lunch. -Ehh? We don't get delivery? You make soba when you move. Maybe some roots tempuras? And eggplants... -We have eggplants. -Nice! I'll help. We're good. Tidy your stuff, first. You can take care of that? Yes. We're sisters, let's drop the formalities. Okay! This is Yoshi's room. This was Sachi's old office. It's small... But it faces south! Ah. Will the desk fit...? It's really narrow... Suzu? Yes? This is grandma and grandpa. They were both teachers. She looks like Sachi. Never say that to Sachi! She hates it. Ah? Mom always told her that, when they were fighting. Hello! He's here! -We're done, already... -Eh? It's hot! That's her boss. Think they're dating? I'd rather not think about it... That girl... I really don't get her. So you played soccer? Yes, when we lived in Sendai. You should do the tryouts, for the Octupus's. Yeah! That's the local team. Girls your age can also join. We'll go cheer you on. Main dishs ready! Ah! Sorry! I was completely useless today! No worries. Chika owes you a lot. Nah... The food is really delicious! Need more salt? No no. It's perfect like that. Hamada, you played soccer? I did a bit of Alpinism, is all. Not just "a bit". He climbed the Manaslu seven years ago! Really? But then, I had an accident trying to climb Everest... I lost six toes. Eh? Six?! My toes... wanna see? I'm good. You sure? You can touch. No no. Do you want a picture? I'm good! Alright. Sit down everyone. Sit down! I'm from Yamagata High School. My name is Suzu Asano. Nice to meet you. Give her a round of applause! Your seat's over there. Yamagata, that's north from here. You'll remember it this time? If you forget it, you can now ask Suzu directly. Nice to meet you! You joined a club? Soccer club. Soccer? Cool! -I'm in basket. -Me too. Future pro players! Asano! Hamada asked me to bring you this, for the Octopus's. Your parent needs to sign it. Can my older sister sign it? Yeah, no problem. -Alright, Thanks. -See ya. You're gonna join? If I pass the tryouts. Looks good! A child is not a pet, you know! I know that! You consulted your mom? No... your niece has nothing to do with it. Decidedly... You're as stubborn as my older sister was! But I have to insist... Raising a child can be very hard! I'll be okay. I had to raise Yoshino and Chika by myself, after all. Sachi, really think about it.... She may be your sister... But she's also the daughter of the woman who broke your family! C'mon now! She wasn't even born yet. Once again, you're not close to getting married... Slow down, Masashi! Here! Trying to hit a plane, Fta!? -Sorry. -Don't worry. Asano, nice pass. She read that play perfectly. -Yeah, she can play! -She's good Endurance and balance. Just like Neymar! Guess that one! -Zidane? -That's it! He's old! Fta also has siblings... But they're all boys. I had a feeling... The coach works with Sachi. He's a doctor? Hmm. Looks like one. Here. For our new recuit! Looks good! That's Ninomiya. She took care of us, growing up. When she was this big...! Eat while it's hot! Thank you! Mmm, smells good. Can't wait! A new member? She's Sachi's half-sister. Somehow, she ended up looking just like her. It's too big! -It's so good! -Right!? So, your sister moved in? Still, it's a bold move... You don't disappoint! I'm glad I went to the funeral. I wouldn't have met her. It's okay to follow people's advice from time to time. Thanks. On your next day shift, wanna get dinner? Okay. I'll get back to you. You're looking tired, lately. I'm just a bit busy, at work. Nothing like what you're going through... What? With Suzu, I mean... Her being your half-sister and all. Nah. She's a good kid. There seems to be more to it. How? Here you go, your rice croquette. Also... you told them you didn't need the inheritance money? Yeah, Sachi wanted none of it. So they got rid of all their problems... Looks like they killed two birds with one stone. But Suzu's the one who decided to come... Maybe someone forced her hand? No way... Yoshino, you're so naive... You have a big house! It's old and full of bugs. It's cold during winter and we can't lock the doors! -What!? -I swear! No way... It looks like a girl's dorm. Yoshino! Ah. you're back! Hello. The dorm mother... -That's my sister. -Hello, I'm Fuji. Nice to met you. Thanks for accompanying my sister. Nah, she's the one watching over me. -See ya. -See ya. -Good night. -Good night. Good night. Bye bye. What?... What's that face? I'm surprised, that's all. What do you mean by that? I don't just date bums... I didn't say that. What do you mean? You always spoil your boyfriends. I spoil them? How!? You lend them money... You buy them dinner... -Welcome back. -Hi. I can spend my money the way I want, can I?! Then stop drinking and making a scene about it! You have no idea what it's like to be drunk... And I'm better off for it. Ahh! She annoys me! I'm not taking my bath after her! The water's still hot. Is everything alright? They always sweat the small stuff. Hello! Welcome back. Suzu, which rice cake you prefer? Chunky. -I agree. -I like smooth the best... -Where's Yoshino? -Taking a bath. Why is she going before me... You always take an eternity! Go after me! Crazy woman! Sis! Big sis!!! Why is she screaming like that... She's not a child anymore... -Probably a spider cricket. -Spider cricket? -Never seen one? -No. They look like that... Like that...? Come take a look. Don't worry! Good morning Suzu. Good morning. It's cold, today. Wow! It's all plum alcohol? Hmm... This one's from last year, and the year before. And grandma made that one 10 years ago. It's pretty! Chika. Stop putting soy sauce on everything... You should have woken me up! It's so cold... Sorry Yoshino! My alarm didn't go off! -It did. -I stopped it? -Yeah... What goes around, comes around. Argh. I'm 10 minutes late! Calm down! I--Am--Calm! You seen my lipstick? No... Sit down! I don't have time... Wait a minute... Is that my blouse!? Maybe... Take it off! C'mon! I'm only borrowing it for today! No way. Take it off! You borrowed my boots last time! You always bring that up... This blouse doesn't even suit you. Do I look like a granny? Granny? What do you mean by that!? "What do you mean by that". Stop messing around! -Have a good day -You too. Suzu! -The signature, for the team. -I forgot! -Take care. -I will. Wait! What? Forgot my wallet... Ah! found it. -Take care. -You too. Yoshino, the trash! Good luck! Careful! It's slippery! Argh! I'm dying! We can make it if we run! Hurry up Yoshino! The train's here! Yoshino, you'll be on time? No worries. It's not an important job... Also... You can stop calling me that. Eh? "Yoshino" Just call me Yoshi! Okay! In school... Anyone catch your eye yet? No... Hurry! It will open up a whole new world for you! Eh? What do you mean? You'll be able to bear... Even the most boring of jobs! -Thank you. -Thank you. Number 56, please! I'd like to close this savings account. Yes, no problem. Please fill this form. Please sign here, here and here. Hurry up. I owed that guy money... You deserve a better man... Yamanoi lost all his toes, but he still continued to climb. That's right. You should try again. Not everyone can do that! How about this one? -But this isn't the same color as yours. -It isn't? -Oh! What's that!? -I didn't mean... -Want me to come to the game? -Yes. Boss, you wanna come to the game? I'll come. Do you best! Will do. Thanks! Do your best! Hey, you seen Arai? She was just here. Eh eh! She's in trouble again? Mrs Sato's daily report... It says 120 liters of urine. That can't be right... She must feel so relieved! It's not funny... Ninomiya? Sachi! Long time no see. It's been a while... What are you doing here? I've been having stomach ache, recently. Oh, that's not good! Yeah... Since my mom died, there's been lots of downs. It's been about a year, right...? ...You should come to the restaurant! Yeah. I miss it... Ah. I wanted to tell you... Your little sister came to the restaurant, the other day. She told me! She said she loved the deep-fried fish! Such a lovely child. She was having so much fun! She was smiling from ear to ear! Was she? Yeah, she was the star of the day! That's good to hear. Hi. Hello. It's freezing! You still have homeworks? Yoshino started acting up. It was hard to concentrate... Probably another breakup... She never seems to learn... You're gonna catch a cold! You should go to bed. Here is... fine... Fine... Good night... Chika, don't be a child. Well then... good night. Good night. Suzu... If you ever need to talk. About anything... Yeah, thank you. -Here. Premier League's. -Ah, thanks. Ahhh. Maybe one day, I'll meet my prince charming here. -In your dreams. -You're so cheezy! That's because Miho's a princess! I'm spent. Alright, that wasn't bad. Asano. Take position close to your opponent. Don't let him outrun you. Okay. Ozaki, make space in front of you. Got it. It seems the team's momentum changed when Suzu joined. Right? Even captain Fta. He plays way better! Those two... you don't think...? Think what? C'mon on, you know... Ahhh! Yeahh. Go! Counter! Let's go! Nice catch! Asano Asano! Asano, hey! OK! Asano! Yes! A Terminal Care department? It seems we need one more than ever, now. We're going to install 20 beds on the 5th floor, next year. When this project came to be... You're the first person I thought about. What do you say? Can you think about it? I will. -Welcome. -Good evening. Ah, the potatoes are from Hokkaid. They're good! I think Ill make a potato salad! I can deal with the sick... But a patient who knows he's gonna die... I don't know if I could. I guess that's why I chose Pediatrics... I don't wanna let a single patient die. Think it over, before you accept. I will. About tomorrow... Enosui's Night Aquarium! Right... It's my mother-in-law... She's been in a slump, recently. -She's going to be hospitalized again? -No, it's not as bad this time. I just need to go check on her... Sorry. You should go. I'm home. Suzu, you're alright? Suzu! What should we do...? Suzu. What happened?! Ah! Big sis! She scored a goal... So we drank a bit to celebrate. She was acting like me when I drink to much Shch. She got pale, all of a sudden... -How much did she have? -Only one glass. Suzu. I hate Yko! I hate her!! Screw you Dad!! Im hot... I'm wanna throw up! Ahhh! Hold it. Just wait a sec! Watch out. Here, here. Where?! Here! Ah! Wait! Wait! I hate this!!! That girl was pissed... Can't blame her, though. You're right, she's exactly like you... Well I'm not THAT bad! She smiled. Ah look! She's got a beauty mark there. She does. She has long eyelashes, eh? Her ears are just like yours. Really? Sorry Suzu. Chika is at fault, but so are you. I wanted to try it, since it was homemade. Alright. I'll make you fresh juice when we pick the plums next year. The plums grow here? Yeah. You can see the tree from here. You haven't noticed it? Over there. It grows a lot of fruits. It's also a magnet for bugs. Wow. I can't wait to pick them up. Eh?! the bugs? No! The plums. Take care of the little things and the big things will take care of themselves. Ah! That's what grandma used to say! We still have half a year to wait. I'm looking forward to it. Like that... puff puff! Right, it'll taste better! What? Puff puff. It's here! We'll take that one. Ahh! It's heavy! -Wait up, wait up! -Haha! The look on your face! -It's done. -Great! -I drop it on? -Yeah, all at once. Okay. Thanks for the help! Thank you! Thanks for everything. Thank you. -Goodbye. -See ya. Don't break the bags! How do I look? Pretty good. Like a businesswoman! Hey, what's that... Customer Advisory Care for Financing and... ...In a word?? Hmm, in a word... I now hit the road, with my manager. It means you live to work. And that's bad? I didn't say that. If you are serious... I AM serious! If you're doing this because of your breakup, you're being naive. Maybe I should just keep the same job for the next... 10 years, is it? What do you mean by that!? To begin with, you... Bon apptit! Go ahead. -How is it? -It's good. Right!? Fresh whitebait is a rare treat. First time? Yes... Yeah. Is it?... Yoshino, sit properly. Your leg... Suzu. Chew your food. I think Chika is a bad influence... A bit higher. A bit down... Got it, got it. It's cute if we see the Puff balls. Puff puff! It looks pretty. Purrty! We can glue that one. Make sure of the size before you cut it, Chika. Right there. Stop it! Seriously, stop!! There are no shells? Shells, shells... Look!... Suzu's footstep. Good evening. Welcome! Good evening! It's the first time the whole family's here?! I haven't been able to come in a while. I'm glad you're all here! What to get... Can I get a beer? And spicy deep fried mackerel. Sorry Yoshi! The deep fryer's out of commission. I'll have pan fried mackerel, then... And a beer! Oh! that's rare! I'll also take that, then. Me too! Suzu, you want a beer? I--Never--Drink You little monster... -Here you go. -Mino, look! Eh!? You've become a responsible adult! Haha. C'mon now! You went to the beach? Yes. She's a child alright! I remember you showing off your collection here... Eh? Me!?... You always got scolded because of all the sand. All the times Chika wet her pants over there... Right, right. You were so bad! I'd ran home to get you new clothes. Stop it! Chika, what do you eat? -What to get... -Ehh? I can chose for you. No way! Cheers. Good morning. Asano! -Good morning! -Morning. What teacher you want? Anyone but Osawa... Good morning. Ozaki, I heard the news! What news? -What is it? -I don't know. I'm also in #2. With me? Niiice! -Morning! -Good Morning! You're with us! Ah! Me too! -Ehhhhhh?! -What do you mean by that!? Fta. You're with Asano, you must be happy! Eh? Why... You're a couple, right? -Ah! Why'd you say that? -But I already told everyone!... What are you talking about?! You're kidding right!? -Suzu, you guys are going out? -No no no! My favorite foods are green pepper steak and pork tongue. My goal this year is to win the summer tournament. Thank you. Alright, thank you. Next up... Seto. Yes. My name is Tomoki Seto. You can call me Tomoki. I'm in the baseball team. I also like skateboarding. I hope to participate in the Nationals, this year. Thanks you. Alright, thank you. I bought those to wear, for today! I also got these shoes! I thought I'd dress the part... Hello. I have seen a lot of shops going out of business. Yours is not at that point yet. No? You're numbers are not in the black... But neither is your situation. There is still light. Somehow... I feel a bit reassured. Right? Yeah. A bit. Now then... First, let's take care of this contract for your deposit to Sagami Bank. So your brother contacted you? He broke ties with her family and left, a long time ago. Then, out of the blue, he contacts me. He says he wants the money from my mother's inheritance. He ain't gonna get much, outside of bills... That's what I told him. Outside of this restaurant, I have nothing. He told me to just sell it... I wanna find a way for her to stay here. If there's anything you can do... This shop is her treasure, it's her baby. Haha. Don't exaggerated. But it's been passed from my grandma... I see. Only trouble is going to come out of this. Don't worry. Dealing with trouble... That's our job. You ain't hiding any more secrets from me...? A beautiful lady always has secrets! Oh no... My eyesight must be gettin' worse... How about we go see the cherry blossoms, before it gets even worse? 'Kay. When are we going? You worked at the city bank before, right? Why did you quit? Somehow... I realized... I didn't belong there. You know that feeling? What are you looking at? You're going on a date, Yoshi? I wish... I'm just not sure I'm in the mood right now. So I'm doing this for me. Not for some man. Feeling pretty can boost your confidence. Here, let me... It's ok. I'd chip them playing soccer. We'll just do your pinky. It tickles! Don't move. First time? Your first time... How old were you? Me? hmm. 6 years old. That's young! We went on a trip to Yokohama. Mom bought it for me, there. Bright red! On occasion, it would leak during swim class. The teacher would get so angry. Wow! Fishing season still ain't for a couple of weeks... But y'all don't worry... Whitebait is in season. Enjoy! Bon apptit! Woah! Right?! -Whitebait on toast... It's strangely good!? -Yeah This is your special dish, right? Oh, right. How long has the caf been open? I took over... Around 20 years ago. You've been serving whitebait on toast ever since? I was having some for lunch for myself, one time... And a customer was like: "I want this!" That's how it started. I think my dad used to come to this caf. After mom died, he'd often make me that dish. You wanna go back, tomorrow? If it's on your mind, it's worth asking Fukuda. It's ok. You could ask your sisters? It's hard to talk with my sisters... ...About dad. It's already over... It was just starting to bloom at this time, in Yamagata. When my father got sick... They told him he wouldn't live to see the cherry blossoms. But he hanged in there. He saw the blossoming from the hospital. That's good. Asano... You have time? Yeah...? Where are we going? The tunnel. Tunnel? -Need me to get off? -I'm good! The tunnel! See? It's full of cherry blossoms! Wow! It's been easy going since Suzu arrived, eh? You always took it pretty easy... No kidding... Finally, a capable sister! There's a big one right there! This one? Careful! Ah! This one! Careful... Look! It's big! This batch's going to funa. This one, to our neighbors. It's not much... All that? With grandma, we picked up way more. We had to distribute them all around the neighborhood. That plum tree is also old. It was planted the year mom was born... 55 years ago. 55 years... Yoshino, get that! Chika! Hi, you reach the Kda's. Ah, auntie? Hi! I'm good! Give me a sec... Sachi. Our great aunt from funa... Hello. What...? Mom? Why? It makes sense, she's her biological daughter. Still, I've got a bad feeling about this. Don't overthink it. She hasn't come to the previous anniversaries. "Too far and expensive", she said. Where does she live? Sapporo. How long has it been? 14 years, now. I was still in high school. Maybe she needed time? Time? They were family, after all. Family... Family is not like a marriage. You can't easily end that relation. You can end a marriage easily? Sorry... How about dinner? I haven't prepared anything. Wanna pick something up? We received another call from funa. Mom will stay over there. Ah. She could stay here... It's her home, too. Maybe she still feel guilty? It's long forgotten! I remember it like it was yesterday. Maybe I should go out... Tomorrow. Maybe it's me... Don't say that! It's not your fault. She's just ashamed to face us! Don't you worry about it. The bath's ready. Go, go. I'll go first. Hey Sachi... Don't make a scene this time. This time? Like at grandma's funerals... When you threw a tantrum. I didn't threw a tantrum... You acted like a spoiled brat. That's priceless, coming from you! I wonder what she'll think of Suzu. I couldn't care less, what that woman thinks. I knew you'd say that... Thank you for coming. Mom's late. She's with auntie. She'll be fine. She's probably gonna say she forgot her purse or something. C'mon, Miyako. Hurry! You're always like that... Wait, auntie! It's going to look bad if we're late for the mourning. Mom! C'mon, c'mon. -Long time no see. -Your shoes! Sorry I'm late. I forgot where I put my necklace. That's what I thought. Chika, you changed your hair. Yoshino, I like that color. Maybe I'll try it. Thank you for coming, today. Sorry I haven't called in a while. Mother, this is Suzu. Nice to me you. I'm Suzu Asano. Ahh. It's you. Ah. well... Nice to meet you. I'm Sachi's mom. Remember me? We met last year! Yes. You're my sisters's great aunt. You like it here? Do they feed you well? Do they take care of you? Auntie, now's not the time. It's important. You weren't getting along with your stepmom? Auntie! She was nice to me. -You're not lonely? -I'm not. I feel like the youngest girl in a dorm. Aha! Nicely said! Sorry for today. It's probably not easy for you. I'm okay. It's not easy for me, too... The girl's are treating you good? Yes. Sachi has a strong personality... She takes that from me. They've been good to me. You girls seem to get along. What a day... But all went fine, in the end. Before it melts... Thank you. Eh, where's that child? Ah, Suzu. Come here. Let's eat, before it melts. Thank you. Please, go ahead. A memorial service is tiring... I'm surprise you didn't drink. Drinking wouldn't have made it easier. Yoshino! Hot, hot. A lot of people came, eh? That's because she was a teacher. Students often came to the house. She took care of a lot of people. She was always busy, eh? Ah, now that you're here, it's a good time... About this house... I think we should get rid of it, once and for all. Rid of it? You mean selling it? Taking care of that garden takes a lot of energy... Also, the girls will eventually get married. So I think an apartment... How dare you say that?! You have no right on this house! Lots of energy... When did you ever took care of the garden?! You want us to abandon this house just like you did?! Why do you get mad like that? It was just an idea... Alright, you two. Why do you always take everything to heart?! I feel bad for what happened! But all of that started, because your father got a mistress. You two, cut it out. It's never your fault, is it!? 'Because of us', you couldn't get a divorce! 'Because grandma didn't agree', you couldn't take us with you! But that's the truth! What'd you want me to do? Stop whining like a child! You two, I've had enough! Sachi, you're going to far. You forget she's your mom. Miyako... They're your kids. So you're also responsible. -But... -No 'but'! This conversation is over! Luckily, my sister's dead... What a shame, for her... You were right to get worried... They hadn't met in a while, these two. And with mom... suddenly suggesting to sell the house. Maybe an apartment's not a bad idea... I always wanted to live by myself! You're free to go if you want... I won't stop you. We can't all live here together, forever... Is that a life? You and mom sing the same tune... You don't like it here? I didn't say that. But me, Chika and Suzu... we'll have to move out someday. Same for you... I can't. I need to stay... To take care of this place. Nobody asked you to do that. Stop it, already... Why are you lecturing me? You just wanna show mom you're in charge. You're being stubborn again! Stubborn...? When have I been stubborn? You were being stubborn when you decided to adopt Suzu. I thought it was making you happy... But it wasn't... You had the same eyes you have now. I think I'm hungry... Should we make dinner? Knock knock. Yes. We're making dinner. Wanna help? Okay. They have sukiyaki. Hot pot, too! Don't look, don't look. I don't see scallops... Ah. Maybe clams? Too expensive. I hope she doesn't regret it. What's that? Suzu... Coming here, I mean. She's fine. But she tends to feel responsible. Like Sachi. Even if she's the youngest... Thank god she doesn't take after you. What do you mean by that? That's enough onions. Okay. My mom taught me that recipe. It was the first one, and the last one. She'd use seafood all the time... Because it doesn't need to simmer. That was her style... She hated to cook. I'm sorry... For what my mom did. Don't worry about that! It has nothing to do with you! She loved a man who already had a wife... She was a bad person. I'm sorry. We hurt you, didn't we? But... Nobody could have changed what happened... It was no one's fault. We're back! There weren't any scallops, so we went with clams. We also got cream puffs from Kamakura. ...Chocolate ones, mostly! What's the matter? You don't feel good? It's nothing... I'm on the night shift today, so I get out late. What about you? Because of yesterday... I forgot to give you this. This one's for you. And Yoshino... And Chika. And I've got this... For Suzu. Wanna come in? I have a plane to catch... I'd also like to visit your grandmother's grave. Oh. Goodbye, now. Take care. Wait up! I'll come with you. I got scolded by auntie. She reminded me the house is yours, now. Who'd knew... I hated this house so much, I almost couldn't breathe... I never thought it'd become such an important place for you. Why did you talk about selling it, all of a sudden? Let's not talk about that anymore... Pretend you didn't hear anything! I didn't come for a long time... I am sorry. I didn't turn out to be a good daughter. The rain seems to have stopped. I almost forgot about the rainy season. There's no rainy season in Hokkaido. By the way... I heard you still make plum alcohol? Auntie was impressed. Every year, she got me to help her. It was hard. When we were finally done... That's when it felt like summer had really started. Do you want some? Wait for me at the station. I'll be right back! Careful! It's slippery. Don't worry! Thanks for waiting Here. This one's from this year. This one, grandma made. There's still some left? That's the last of it. What a nice color. Brings back memories... I'll cherish it. See ya. You should come back. I think Yoshino and Chika would've like to spend more time with you. Next time, come to my place. See ya. That's big... Lunch is ready. Coming! How is it? It's good! Imagine with cheese! Oh! You're right. I'll try it next time. Your sisters's reputation isn't the best... But on occasions, we can make something edible. My mom used seafood to make curry... But I was little, I don't remember it. So when I think of curry... I think of the processed stuff my grandma used, instead. So that's what her curry tasted like... Chika... I lied to you. About what? Whitebait dish... Dad was often making it, back in Sendai. Really? So that's the kind of food he liked... I don't remember a lot about dad. I remembered a bit because of the pictures you brought. You must have full of memories of him! Good things... And bad things! You'll have to tell me about dad, someday. He liked fishing. Fishing? Really? Yeah. On weekends, he often went to the river. At times, he'd bring me with him. To keep the restaurant, you need to pay 12 million yen to your brother. Counting all your personnal assets, plus bank deposits, it amounts to 6 million yen. You need a loan of 6 million, which... I'm sorry! In truth, this restaurant will close its doors by the end of the month... My physical condition has been deteriorating. Honestly... I didn't expect it to happen so fast. So you're going to focus on your treatments, right? No. I don't get treated, anymore. There's a new terminal care unit at the local hospital. I've made a reservation... Even if this place closes down, I intend to continue to offer the lady's fried mackerel. That's one thing your brother can't take from you. I'm really pissed against God right now. I'm wondering why it had to happen to her. Well then... Let's think of a new proposition! I'm gonna advise her to write a testament. A testament? Her brother is probably not going to want to pay for the funeral. You're thinking of a notarized testament? That way, Ninomiya's share of mother's inheritance should be able to go according to her own wishes. Lets do it! God doesn't think of these details, so we have to take care of them. Although Mrs Saeki's condition got stable yesterday... She died, all of a sudden. The physical condition of patients at the end of their life is so... Thanks Sachi. You really helped us. I wasn't expecting it... The way Arai gave the 'care after death'. Arai? The way she addressed Mrs Saeki... "You must be very tired". "You had a pain here? I'll go gently...". She did every step respectfully, like she was still alive. ...I hadn't notice. Tanabe, in our department, is the same way. He can't do no good, normally, but he has a gift with patients. They always tell him everything! Maybe I only pay attention to people's shortcomings. Cause you're very strict with yourself. It's a good trait! I was always the class president. Kazuya, you have a chewing habit? The ends are all worn out. Yeah. When I was a child, my mother was always telling me to stop. I saw a nice pair of chopsticks at the store, the other day. Did you buy it? No. I would have liked it... For a woman, there's a lot of things to consider when buying for someone... ...Is that right? It's getting late... I have the day shift, tomorrow. Sachi... I'm planning on going to America. My former internship supervisor is in Boston... I want to study medical advances in my field, over there. Won't you come with me? But... I'm gonna divorce my wife. Sorry... it's all so sudden. But... I've thought about it for a while. This is bad for you. -You don't drink anymore? -Those days are over. That's something... Yoshi's working instead of drinking. Hi! Hello. Hi. She bought pears. Boyfriend problems... When she was in college, we were eating apples every day... Ah, that's right! Eh? But who's the boyfriend? I wonder... You don't know nothing! The fact that his wife is sick is not an excuse not to get a divorce. He can't bring himself to abandon her... It's not his fault! But he's still having an affair with you. How's that fair for his wife? He's just like dad... A weakling and an asshole. To be confronted with a person who has an heart disease... It's not easy! Don't speak of something you know nothing about! Even if it's summer vacation, don't stay up too late. -Yoshi, where are you going? -Whereever. Wait! What now!? Sachi is probably hurt. Why? I told her a woman who loves a married man is a bad person. That wasn't fair... It's alright. I wanna talk about it! With both of you... Let's talk about it. Ah! What a drag! -Chika! -Yes?! Plum alcohol! ...on the rocks!! I'll make it! Knock knock. What is it? You have a minute? It's about work... Alright. Because of your work... You are regularly confronted with lots of people dying. I was wondering what it would feel like... Like how you can't allow your emotions to get in the way of your job... Yeah. But to completely make abstraction of all emotions... It's not possible. Right. You reassure me! Work is not something you can just get used to... I think I'll never get used to a patient's death. Thanks for the lesson! This is nice. You can have it. Isn't that your lucky blouse? I think I drained all the luck I could out of that one. Big sis... Our family's gonna be fine. Chika and me, we'll take good care of Suzu. It won't be like before. Thank you. Watch out though. You'll become a mother before you become a wife! Right... I'll be careful. You can always count on us. Next time, say that when you're sober! But I have no reason to say it if I'm not drunk! Suzu, you're going to the fireworks today? Wait a sec. Ah! A yukata... This design suits her very well. Right? I told you. The size is perfect. -This is yours? -That's right Now, it's yours. -Really? -Of course! Go show it to Fta! To Fta? Who's that? Is he good lookin!? He looks... Like an honest kid? -Honesty is the most important thing. -Is it...? I'll try a uniform, next time. Ah! This is grandma's! What are you doing? It has grandma's smell. It does? Gimme gimme... I don't smell... Sorry. I can't go with you. I got the feeling you were gonna say that. It's my fault. For the longest time, I couldn't decide myself. Same for me. It's not about who's fault it is. I think I'll accept the job... In terminal care. I see. My dad said he was ashamed to face us. Because of that, a burden was put on Suzu. By being there for her, maybe I can make up for it. For my dad... And for Suzu... That child... She suffered so much. She was robbed of her childhood. She wasn't the only one... You too, lost your childhood. Always surrounded by adults... I guess so. Try to regain some of it, little by little. But that's not something I can help you with. Well then. Thanks for the meal! We haven't had the chance to eat your pan fried mackerel, yet. Sorry. Next month, you'll have your fill! We'll come back! Suzu! See you. ...It's a bit of a hassle, but take this with you. It's spicy deep-fried mackerel. That's Yoshi's favorite! Tell her it's for everything she did for me. I will tell her. You know... I really envy your parents. Why? That they were able to leave in this world, a treasure like you. I'm not a treasure... Don't say that! It's bad karma, you know! Well now, have fun! Yes. Fireworks on the sea is a sight to see. Auntie, see ya! Thanks for the meal! Take care. See you. Watch out, Suzu. I'm a gentleman! Watch out, watch out! All good. It's shaking! Amazing! Is it safe here? Amazing! From the roof, it's feels a bit lonely. Yeah... If we didn't work overtime, we could watch it with our boyfriends. Yeah... Oh well. Good evening. It's so pretty! Ah! A heart!? -It looked like a heart. -My eyes are fuzzy! You wanna go again? Mountain climbing... Nah. I'm good now. Let's go carp fishing, next time! Like this? How's that? You want the float to sink immediately. With more force? You gotta feel it. -Gently, eh? -Yeah, gently. Id like to stay here. What are you talking about? When I lived in Sendai... And in Yamagata... I always thought that. Because of me... People often get hurt. Sometimes... It becomes hard to deal with. In my family, I'm the youngest. My mom and dad always wanted a girl, but they only got boys... With each new kid, they got more disappointed... I think that's why they didn't take a lot of pictures of me. Eh? It's a funny story? That's not it. See ya. Asano. This yukata... It suits you well! Good night. See you tomorrow. I'm back. Welcome back. Welcome back! How was it? You broke any heart?! Nonsense... You're getting red! Anyway, why are you all dressed like that? We thought of doing fireworks. She's wearing grandma's. It's a bit old-fashioned, though. It's made for you! Let's all go. Let's go! Sparklers! Ah! Watch out! Oh! It ran out. -Its pretty, eh? -Yeah Hey! What if someone came by!? Big sis! You prefer sweet or sour? Sour! A bit sour... Strong or light? Strong! It's not bad for a first time. Wanna try? -Here -Thanks It's sour! You're a child alright. Compared to my older sister! Oh! Cheap shot! This is one of your plums. This is one of yours. That's definitely Chika's writing... Definitely not! Sachi, 3 years old. Chika, 3 years old. Yoshi, also 3 years old. Yoshi, 5 years old. Sachi, 6 years old. 9 years old. Chika, 11 years old. Chika, 12 years old. Chika, 13 years old. Yoshi, 14 years old. Ah! Sachi, 15 years old. You're a bit smaller than I was. Hey! Don't cheat. Alright. Suzu... 15 years old. You're okay? I don't remember climbing that high... Are we lost? I hope when can find our way back... We're here! It's true... It really looks like that place. When I was a child, I came here often, with dad... After he left, I came by myself. Try it. I'm good. Come on. Screw you Dad!! Screw you Mom!!! I wanted... To spend more time with her. It's okay to talk to me... About you mom. Suzu, you can stay here... Always. I want to stay here ...Always. Lets all go home, now. -Bye. -See you tomorrow. -You're okay? -Yeah. See ya. It was a nice funeral. She had a good life. You did a lot for her. You gave her peace of mind before she passed away. The photograph of Ninomiya... She had a pretty smile. She was beautiful. Did you take the picture? That was on our last date. The cherry blossoms... They're from that road, right? In the hospital, she often talked about them... How those cherry blossoms were real pretty. Even if she knew she was dying, she was still able to enjoy the beauty of this world. She was happy. She said so. Suzu. If you ever wanna know about your father. come to me. Okay, I will. Dad also said the same thing. Before he died, he mentioned the cherry blossoms... How they were still pretty, and that he felt happy. He also had a great life. I wonder what will be my last thought... Probably a man... Nah, alchool! That's my Yoshi! What about you? I wonder... Maybe our veranda. "Once again, you're not close to getting married" Hey, wanna hear mine!? You have weird thoughts... How mean! What about you? A lot, because I'll have done a lot! You're still a child alright. Compared to my sisters! Again with that! In 50 years, we'll all be old women the same. That's gonna be fun! Dad... He was a loser... But he was also a kind man. Why? Because... He left us our little sister. Yeah... That true! For sure! What are you talking about? Nothing. Careful Chika. Got it. I got wet. What's that? Ah! Chika!
