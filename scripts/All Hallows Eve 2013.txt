All right then, what was it? A monster movie. Fine, I'll put it back on. Hey, Miss Witch, why don't you give those fingers a rest and go wash your face. I will. What time are my parents coming home? Uh, I don't know. 1:00? Hopefully sooner. I get to stay up till one? No, bedtime's at 11. Stop eating all that candy. You're gonna be up until tomorrow morning. Very cute. Your parents owe me for this one. You could slap him if you want. I won't tell. Oh, really? I'll keep that in mind. What time is it? Oh, it's 10:50. All right, seriously, pumpkin carving in 10 minutes. I wanna get this over with. Yeah, come on, Timmy. Get the hell up. I'm not done counting my candy, loser. Can we just bury him in the backyard and tell my parents we lost him trick-or-treating? Hey, look what I got. What is that? It's a videotape. Where did you get that? Fell out of my bag. Let me see it. Who gave this to you? I don't know. You don't remember who put it in your bag? No. It doesn't say anything. Let's watch it. Oh, absolutely not. Why? Why? Because God knows what's on this, that's why. Only one way to find out. Timmy, you're not watching it. Yes I am. Timmy, stop being such an asshole. Hey! I said no. It's my tape, I can do what I want with it. Yeah, well, I'm in charge of you and you have to listen to me. Let your parents watch it. If they say it's okay, you can watch it tomorrow. No. I wanna watch it now. No, you're not watching it. Fine. Let's put it to a vote. I vote we watch it right now. Put it to a vote? What is this? The town hall? Little traitor, now you're on his side? What? I just wanna see what's on the tape. Two against one. We win, put it on. Do you understand this is creepy? Some pervert could have put it in your bag. Who knows what's on this? It's probably just a scary movie. If it's that bad, you can turn it off. We won't tell our parents. It can't be worse than the stuff we see on the Internet every day. what do you watch on the Internet? You know what? I don't wanna know. Please. We won't make you carve the pumpkin. Fine, but you have to go in the other room. Yes! - I need to see what's on it first. - Yes! Ugh, this is retarded. Well, what is it? Well, give me a second! Anything? I don't see anything. Looks like you got hosed, Timmy. Oh, wait a minute. What is it? Uh, I don't know. This is stupid. Come on. Um, excuse me. Who said the two of you can come back in here? See? It's just a scary movie. Let's watch it. Wait for the gate agent to give your boarding announcement. Check your monitors. Thank you kindly. Fine, but if it gets out of control, I'm turning it off. Yeah, yeah. Oh, my God, that's great. Um, girl... Do you know what time the train comes? Uh, it should be about 10 minutes or so. Uh, do you have a cigarette? No, sorry. Yeah, thanks. Well, happy Halloween. Come on, let's go. I need a fucking cigarette. Come on. Please stand by for further information. Please stop. What are you doing? Let me go. Help! Help! Help! Help! Help! Somebody help me, please! Somebody answer me! Please! Who's there? Where am I? What's happening? Would someone talk to me? Please stop screaming. What's happening to us? This is where he keeps us. There were three of us. There was another girl. What happened to her? She was dragged down into that tunnel. They're pulling us down by our chains one at a time. Why are you two just sitting there? Why aren't you trying to escape? We've tried everything, there's no way out. Why is he keeping us here? Why doesn't he just kill us already? Why are you doing this? Let us go! Please! Don't cry. We're gonna die down here. Don't say that. We're gonna get out of here. I don't wanna die. - Shut up! Just shut up! - Kristen! I can't take it anymore. I can't keep listening to this. She's just scared. Okay? - I'm sorry. - We all are. I'm sorry. We can't fall apart on each other now. We're all we've got. What's your name? Casey. I'm Sara. That's Kristen. There has to be a way out of here. I told you, there isn't. Then we have to go down into that tunnel. What? We can't just stay here. Going into that tunnel is suicide. Oh, and staying here isn't? What do you know? You didn't see what happened to that girl. We did. We watched her getting dragged down into that tunnel and she was screaming for her life, and we were trying to hold on to her but he just... He pulled her right out of her hands. We're not strong enough. There's three of us now. If we go together, we might have a chance. We don't even know how many of them are down there. What do you suppose we do? The only thing we can do is just wait here and hope that somebody finds us. She's right, Kristen. There's no other way. No, Sara. Please. You know I'm right. Don't listen to her. She's dead already. Don't go! I'm sorry. There's no other choice. Don't leave me here alone! He's gonna kill you. Kristen, we have to, we can't just wait here to see who's gonna be... Oh, my God. It's got her. Oh, my God. Listen to me, Kristen, we have to go now. You hear me? We have to go down there. I can't, I'm too scared. I know you are and so am I, but right now I'm thinking about my family. I'm gonna get out of here and I'm gonna see them again and everything's gonna be like it was before. I know you feel the same, but we're never gonna see them again if we don't try to get out of here. I can't stay here anymore, Kristen. I can't wait here to die. I just can't. We're gonna make it. Do you understand me? We're gonna be all right. Just stay close and be quiet. This is where it ends. Right, stay here. Oh, God, look, look, look! Use it on the chains. I think it's big enough. I think it's working. Oh, God! Help me, help me please. There's something down there. We have to get out of here. Come on! No! Please. Please. Please stop. Please stop. Don't hurt my baby. That was sick! Okay, that is enough for tonight. Hey, what're you doing? I'm turning it off. It's too violent for the two of you. No, it's not. We've seen way worse. You're too young to be watching a baby cut out of someone's stomach. Come on, let's go. It's bedtime. Bedtime? Yes, bedtime. Tia, go wash your face. I want the both of you to brush your teeth. Man, it was just getting good. Aw. I know. I liked the clown. Yeah, he was great. I liked when he honked his horn at the lady. That was so funny. Yeah, that was hysterical. I'm gonna be up to check on you guys in 10 minutes. What is that supposed to mean? It's already been quite an eventful evening. Why, what happened? Some creep slipped a videotape into Timmy's candy bag A videotape? Yeah, like a 1982 VHS. That's very twiste. Oh, God. What did you subject those kids to? I don't know, it's this... Fucked up short film with a clown and the devil raping this woman. Sounds like my kinda mov. No, seriously, what kind of sick bastard puts that in a kid's candy bag? Probably some loser who still lives in his parents' garag. Yeah, that's what Timmy and Tia said. Move away. I have to spit. I was here first. Get out! You better move. No! That's it. Don't say I didn't warn you. Timmy, don't even! Okay. Timmy! Hold on a minute, Dee. What's going on up there? Sarah, Timmy spit in my hair! It was an accident! I'm reconsidering having children at this point. How did Barbara ever talk you into this? What was I supposed to say? No? You're a good friend. Yes, I am. Speaking... Speaking of good friends, do you wanna meet me for a drink after this? Yeah, I can totally do tha. All right, perfect. I need one. I'll text you when I'm leaving. Cool. Oh, and Sarah... Yeah? Don't get killed. Funny. Bye. Bye. Little shit! All right, let's go. Is my tape in there? No. Where is it? Can I have it, please? No. I don't know why you're making such a big deal out of this. My parents are just gonna give it to me in the morning. All right, then. The faster you get your little butt to bed the faster you'll get your tape. You suck, Sarah. Goodnight. Lights out, kiddo. All right. Are you gonna tell my parents that Timmy spit in my hair? Well, it depends. Is he gonna get in trouble? Yeah. Then absolutely. Cool. Did you have a good Halloween? Yeah. Did you get enough candy? I guess so. You guess so? Look at that bag, it looks like you were trying to find the golden ticket. Do you think that clown was real? See? Ugh, I knew this was gonna come back to bite me. No, it's just make-believe. Demons, witches, monsters, that... That doesn't exist. But he wasn't really a monster, if you think about it, like a vampire or a werewolf. He was just a man in a costume. Someone like that could really exist, right? Like a serial killer, I mean. What do you know about serial killers? See, you watch so much stuff on that computer. It's gonna rot your brain. I sound like my grandmother. Listen to me, the clown's only on the video, right? So if you don't watch it, he can't hurt you. And even if he could, I wouldn't let him. You swear? I cross my heart. Okay. Time to go to bed. Wait, Sarah. Do you want me to leave it on? All right, sweetie. If you need me, I'll be downstairs. Okay. Okay. Sweet dreams. Goodnight. Goodnight, sweetie. Sleep tight. Does anyone up thee know why we're being attacked? Whatever it is, it isn't just happening here. It's some kind of mass murder that's going on everywhere. - The radio said to stay inside... - Radio? There's a radio upstais and you boarded us in down here! Nothing! They don't know anything yet.. and people are supposed to look for a safe place to hide. Take the boards off that door. Harry, that radio is at least some kind of communication. they'll tell us what to do. if we lock ourselves in this dungeon... Timmy? What do you want? Can I sleep in here with you tonight? Are you serious? Why? The clown scared you, didn't he? I thought he was so funny. Fine. Don't hog all the blankets, all right? It's my bed, I'll hog them if I want. First eyewitness accounts of this grizzly development came from people who were understandably frightene, almost incoherent. Officials and newsman first discounted... You know what we saw on our property this afternoon? What? A deer. Get out of here! I'm not kidding. It was only ten feet away Oh, that's so cute! I know, isn't it? That is a sign. Deer symbolize peace I think things are really gonna work out great for you guys. God, I hope so. You know, the hardest part is just gonna be adjusting to this new lifestyle. not hearing an ambulance or a bus every two minutes. I'm standing by my window, you know what I hear outside right now? Listen... You hear that? No, what is it? It's nothing. It's absolutely nothing. You could hear a pin drop, that's how quiet it is here. You know what 8:00 in the city sounds like? Like stress? Exactly. And at least here I can just clear my head and John can focus on his work. How is John, by the way? He has his first exhibition coming up in a couple of weeks, I'm gonna have to get my hands on one of his paintings Ugh, I wish you'd buy his latest painting so I can get it the hell out of this house. Thing gives me the creeps. What is it? It's a face. Just a horrible face. Honestly, I just... I can't even be in the same room as this thing. I didn't know John painted things like that. He doesn't. According to him, he doesn't even remember painting it. He doesn't remember painting it? No, he swears he was in some sort of trance or something. And all he remembers is waking up from this terrible nightmare with this image in his head. And the next morning, there's this painting in the living room. That's really strange. Yeah, well, you know how artists are. and I still can't figure out how his mind works. The owner of the gallery thinks that it's gonna be one of his best sellers. Well, I hope everything works out for you guys. I'm really looking forward to seeing the house. maybe you and Bob could come up for a weekend. Bye. All right, bye. Shit. Fuck! We're sorry, your call cannot... Oh, fuck! Fuck this. Okay. Are you kidding me? You gotta be fucking kidding me, come on. Start! Fucking car, start. What the fuck! Are you fucking kidding me! Oh, my God. It's okay. It was just a meteor, right? It's just a meteor. Just like the one in Russia... It's fine. It's totally fine. The electricity goes out, nothing works. You're gonna be fine. It's okay. Just calm down. Calm down. What the fuck is that? God damn it. - John! - Hey, there you are. I'm headed back now. I tried calling the house but I couldn't get through. Is everything okay? No! Something landed by the house. Something landed by the house. I don't know, It was just so loud, I thought it was gonna crash into the kitchen. Was it a plane? I don't know. I thought it was a plane or a helicopter, Yes. It was only a hundred feet away from the house. Did you call the police? I couldn't. My phone wasn't working until you called me. Call them. And whatever you do, stay in the house. Okay. I will. John, I'm really, really scared. I think there's somebody in the house. There's no one in the hous. You're just getting spooke. I don't want you to go. No, no. What if I get off the phone and then I can't get in touch with you again? You can stay at the Red Lion until the power comes back o. I can't. The car's dead. What do you mean the car's dead? I told you, nothing's working, John. There's something really strange going on around here. John? John, are you there? God damn it! Ahhh! We're sorry, your call cannot... - John! - Caroline, what's wrong? Please come and get me, John. Caroline! Caroline, listen to me! It's at the door. Can you come help me? Caroline, hang on, hang on! Caroline! Caroline, can you hear m? The police are coming. Caroline! Caroline! No! John! No. John, help me! Help me, please, John! Somebody help me! Who makes this shit? Why am I watching it? Where are they? Tia, Timmy, I told the both of you to go to bed. Don't pretend like you're sleeping. I told you to go to bed. We are in bed. So it must have been someone else's little mischievous feet running up the stairs. What are you doing in here? She had a nightmare. I didn't have a nightmare. I heard a noise. You heard a noise? What kind of noise? I don't know. You can't describe the noise? Well, where did it come from? My closet. Your closet? Yes, she does. This happens all the time. Shut up, Timmy. It was real. There was someone in there. Maybe it's the clown. Timmy, stop it. Shh, listen. I think I just heard his horn. Stop it. He's gonna drug you and take you to the witches. Timmy, knock it off. Tia, listen to me, we talked about this before. There's nothing in your closet, not a clown, not anyone. I want the both of you to go to bed. Maybe we could if you'd stop checking in on us every five minutes. What are you talking about? I heard you creeping around outside the door and turning the handle. Just go to bed. Hello? Right, Sarah. You're watching too many scary movies. Oh! This is ridiculous. when I can't even convince myself? You're listening to WORW 970. It's one minute past the witching hour. Halloween is officially here. Look your doors, bolt your windows are nestled safely in their beds. Stick with me after the break and I'll be joined by... Perfect. Hello? Anybody there? Need some gas. Get the fuck out of here, man! Are you out of your fucking mind? You think you can just piss all over the place and smear your shit on the walls? What the fuck is wrong with you? I'm giving you 10 seconds or I'm gonna call the cops. Hey! I mean it. So, what can I get you? Um, fill it up. Regular. Cash. So that guy really just did that to your bathroom? Uh, not my bathroom. I'm not picking up someone else's shit. Why didn't you just call the cops? What's the point? He's already gone. I'm just gonna have to fill out paperwork. Supposed to be off in an hour. Yeah, but what if he comes back? Uh, I've got enough blunt objects I can bludgeon him with. He's lucky I didn't fucking break his legs. God, you really were low, huh? Yeah, good thing I saw your sign when I did. I'm actually kind of lost. Oh. Well, where are you headed? Um, New York. I'm just trying to get back to the interstate. Um, you got a pen and paper? I can give you directions. It's not far. Oh, yeah. Sure. Where are you coming from? Um, Albrightsville. I was up on a movie shoot there. Oh, you're in the movies? You know, independents, mostly. Couple of commercials. Is there anything I would have seen you in? Oh, I'm not an actress. I'm a costume designer. Oh, I've never met a costume designer before. Well, now you have. All right. Uh... What you wanna do is get back onto the 94. Mmm-hmm. You're gonna go about six miles. You're gonna see a bridge... What was that? Uh, hang on a second. I'll be right back. Hey, sir? Hello? Come on, you piece of shit! Emergency. What is the problem? Yes. Please... You have to help me. There's been a murder. Please hurry. Emergency... What's your location? There's been a murder! The old gas station over on 94. Send help! There's... That's impossible. That's fucking impossible! Please! The killer's out here, he's following me. Hello? Hello? Oh, no. Please, God. Oh, shit! This can't be real. This can't be real. This can't be happening! Yes. Oh, please God. Hello? Please, you gotta help me. Hello! Please, God! Help me! Yes, it's ringing. Please. Hello? Nick! Please, call the police! Somebody is trying to kill me. My phone's gonna die any second. I'm on Route 94, heading home. Baby, I'm so scared. Nick? Nick! Fuck! Come on! Ah! Stop. Stop! Please... Help me! Help me! Hey. Are... Are you okay? Have you been in an accident? Just drive! Get out of here. There's somebody after me. Who's after you? Some man. He's in a clown costume. He's trying to kill me. This isn't some sort of Halloween prank, is it? I suppose not. How bad are you hurt? I don't know. There's a... There's a police station a few miles up ahead. Just hang in there, okay? Everything's gonna be fine. Oh, God! What? That's him! What's wrong? What? Get out of here! Hurry! What's wrong? Why? - Hello? - Yes. Please... You have to help me. There's been a murder. Please hurry. Who is this? There's been a murder! The old gas station over on 94. Send help! Dee? Please! The killer's out here, he's following me. Who's following you? Some man. He's in a clown costume. He's trying to kill me. Fuck! Oh, my God. Oh, my God! Do you think that clown was real? Someone like that could really exist, right?
