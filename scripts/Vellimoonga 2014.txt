By giving the face of purity. A Gandhian principle which lead to complete independence. He wished that 'khadar' should evolve as a symbol of a culture. After gaining independence. The 'khadar' and the politics it represented. In the corridors of power and among the people it emerged as a power. In between the ruling and creation of funds. The shape and expression of 'khadar' kept on changing. In the corridors of power. With the pomp in abundance of money. It became a representation of a certain political culture. The principles of Gandhiji. One person who saw it as breath of life. Had lived in our little Kerala. He was called as CP by compatriots. 'Cherian Pakilomattom'. Who made 'pure politics' as the penance in life. One hailed from Kajirapali. A true Gandhian, who realized politics is true service to the nation. Wife Annakutty and three children. Mamachan, Tom, Sally. In the 10 acre land which was obtained as ancestral property. What is left out at present is... ...a small house and one acre enclosure that is surrounded. The all the rest is borrowed by 'politics based on principles'. In the strike for existence. During the early days of 80's. The migration to Malabar. In the northern regions of Kannur district. Close to Karnataka forest. A mountain village named 'Santhipuram'. Over there. By clearing of ginger forest, one six acre land. For an average family that is more than enough to live. But again the politics made CP, a debtor. Without gaining anything. Losing everything when being suppressed to death. On holding Mamachan's hand, he pitifully looked. Mamachan, knew the meaning of that look. The dreams of one entire family. Mamachan took on his shoulders. For that. He combed off his own dreams. He liked his father. But he hated his politics which ruined everything. Like that, that day has come. The day which changed Mamachan's route of life. Mother! Mother! Mother! Where have you kept my shirt and all? That will be there in the cupboard. Where is it? Father's only. With this let there be some kind of use, like this. Hey fellow! Look. Okay good wearing it. Should not commit any mischief. How come Mamachan is on 'Khadar' today? There should be something else, no? Only this was left behind by father. So thought of wearing this. Brother, take this okay. I'll come now. Okay, okay. It's some kind of problem. Sir, don't push sir. What happened? Big playing with cards. With money? No, for a cup of tea. Now what to do next? Shall I go home and tell? No, tell in his house. Don't tell in my house. Sir is calling you. For what? I'm not with them. You are only called. Go, come back only after getting two. Yes, come in. There was no need of coming. Could have at least made a phone call. They will be released right now itself. Sir, you may sit. L... Sit sir. Not sitting little busy. Sir your name? Mamachan! The silver owl with the silica eyes The silver owl with the silica eyes On that day, the politician as Mamachan. No, the so called Khadar dresser Mamachan was born. After that Mamachan has not removed the Khadar. Then full fledged political worker. While remaining in big parties... ...it was during the time had realized won't reach beyond panchayat. Uttar Pradesh resident Anand Sharma. A party called DNC was formulated. There by Mamachan moved on to... ...DNC and became follower of 'practical politics'. Today Mamachan is the DNC's youth Wing's national secretary. The central minister Anand Sharma is the God like figure. The sacred places are Delhi and Uttar Pradesh. This is the story of Mamachan. The story of 'Khadar' which was worn by Mamachan. 'After 22 years..' That is Jose is it not? That kind of going is by getting mad. Actually is it there? Or is it a mere eyes wash on us? Yes, it is there. Today morning while calling from... ...DCC, only I came to know about the matter. Yes. Look, Jose. Comrade, lal salam.(Red salute) Go, ask. We'll try. Kutticha, go and ask. Hey man, even if asked not going to tell the truth and all. Just go there. Go. All the ones who had drunk has come, is it not? Jose is waiting, go. Now there will be no one left out to know. Jose! This... Did you see that? Hey man. A vice president without any respect towards opposition. And one president. Look. I'm a good for nothing husband and. I'm scared of you. There is a talking in the village. I'm only being decent like this... ...when getting cross, I'm a contemptible fellow. Do you know that? Don't I know all that? You don't bother all that. Out here one person is luring on you, I've a small doubt. Yes, well who is this Jose? Yes, that contemptible fellow only. If I get him in my hand. Will hit him and..Oh my heavens! Jose, now only I've told about Jose and put my tongue inside my mouth. The tongue can be put inside the mouth... ...can it be drained and put on the hanger? Can't be done. The cow is standing in the sun I'll move it and come now. Jose shall I go? Today also lost from the hand. Why looking like this? I've told a thousand times to the president. Without asking me shouldn't do any matter. For that what did I do? To the ones who are waiting outside... ...who told the matter of road? Will she do like that? That too, to me. No, no. I only, today at 11 o'clock there is an explanation... ...meeting which is to be held. Ruined! Can't you do all this by asking me? I had called Josettan. Told outside the network. But still... ...anger will come, no? Is it that big problem? My president such a project is for the first time in our area. The estimated cost is 2 crore. Central government's village development special project. All the illicit pregnancy of the centre are created by me... ...one is saying like that and walking out there. The national leader Mamachan. On previous day, about this same road. In our Kunjikutty's tea shop. I've heard him talking about this. Is it? Eating the jack fruit from my house. And sitting in front of my house. This Mamachan is a person who is like that. Stupid fellow! Once if we don't play carefully. This also will be taken by him okay. Will it be a problem? As far as I've known, Mamachan will come only after 5th. For the time being the president at the explanation meeting. Need not have to give big explanation and all. Let me think. What can be done. Let me also think, fellow. What can be done with you? Santipuram, Jayagiri mountain high way which was made to reality. To the people's leaders. Santipuram citizens revolutionary salutes.

Today it's going to be materialized. Over here. In this rare occasion, to be with you. I'm really happy. In this occasion. Such a beautiful welcome that is staged for me. To all in the language of heart. I'm telling my thanks. This is also gone from the hands of Jose. Truly. Truly to get a project like this for our panchayat, reason for it is... ...they are two personalities. Can anyone tell who they are? Who is it? Your father and mother. Yes, our respected panchayat president Ms. Show and... ...vice president respected Mr. Jose. They are that big two personalities. Till yesterday, he was a person who told... ...Jose should be beaten and killed... ...only then this area will turn out to be good. What happened to him? Dear ones, I remember. For the last so many days. Respected Ms. Show Jose. Ms. Show Mathew. And Mr. Jose. With a demand to execute this project. Several times had come to meet me. Many vital secrets, I... When was it? Who knows. ...shared with president. Because of that, this time at Delhi. With the rural development minister Sharmaji, I spoke about this matter. Also gained a supporting decision. Immediately after meeting Sharmaji and came out, I called Jose and... ...l, informed this happy news. Is it not Jose? Yes. In this occasion. I would like to remind one more thing to president and Jose, that I wish. Your responsibilities to the panchayat is not ending here. The needs in here, which is well known better than me. As a local leaders, you are the ones. Because of that should study each and every problems in panchayat. Should have open discussions with people. Then you should come and meet me. Okay. Then what? If it's a genuine request we can find a solution on that. I'll be there. We still have to move ahead. For that as one among you, as one with you. Like so far, I'll be always there with you. On these topics they have got the caliber to talk authentically. Our Jose and president. I'll talk. Go, go. But... ...since they have not got nothing more to talk, than I spoke. Duped! For the presidential address, I welcome Ms. Jameela Asif to dias. For all my thanks and greetings. 'Can you do like this?' 'Can you do without informing?' 'The beans and porridge is for us' On telling the opposition was not informed. Under the leadership of Maniyan Kuttichan. Kunjumon and followers are doing sit down strike in front of panchayat. For that there is no one over there is it not? Where? It's not necessary that they need people. They are lot of filthy people like that. Here comes a thing, which is not included in any of these. 'A silver owl'. Greetings. Look how he goes. We can play cards. Then get up and come. Okay then. Brother will it go today? There are things to do after going. Asking what is it? Hello Gopi. What Swami? Then didn't say anything to me. Hey, yesterday I was at Delhi, only. Is it so? Reached just now only. One inauguration. Can't be left alone like that, no? Okay then. Aren't you coming man? Then what? Sit in the back. There are no vehicles after this. Who are these people? Then shall we go? To where was the journey? At Delhi, there was a central committee. Mamachan, will you become a minister soon? Mamachan, money! No need you keep it. Shameless fellow, simply going by wearing white and white. Pull, pull! Have made my father to pull a lot is it not? Children. Uncle. Take this. Uncle, what did you bring? There was nothing at the shop. Hey girl, come lets go and play. Wait fellow! Hey boy! Have you returned after roaming? Silly fellow! Like you fooling the compatriots. Fooling this children, that is not possible my dear Mamachan. Your some character they will also get some of it, is it not? Old lady, didn't it die? No, you shameless fellow! My heavens! Your father was an excellent congress worker. Have always made the compatriots to talk good about him. For that what is there, now? To make the compatriots talk, you are also not bad at all! Not that, today also some how managed to sit in front of jeep, no? Then what? Can one sit on top. Last day while going to church, heard someone talking. As you can't sit in the front. You won't get inside an auto. While going to a marriage house, should become a marriage boy. While going to a house where the death has occurred... ...should lie inside the coffin! On hearing the people talking, will feel like peeling off the skin! A son born to spoil the name of the father! That father's name is... ...written in a notice and send by the bank. The acquisition notice! It is also good old lady knows that one also. If at all such a acquisition notice has come. By cheating anyone you must have paid that one also... ...this mother knows that. Indeed! I stopped that practice! Mother's dear son is there, no? Village officer. Tell him to stop self saving. Tell him to pay off that one. Yea, best. After getting a glass of water from him. I don't think I can die. So, you know the things. I know fellow, I know everyone. Look, that girl Sally has come. So what? Do I've to climb the coconut tree? Today also, was she mood out? Who knows. The village officer and the princess wants another house. Kind of nuisances. - Come mother. Not that Sally. Why are you here? I came to see brother only. - Is it? In their place, told there is a girl suited for you. Shall we go and see? I've told you, not to come here saying the marriage topic. How many proposals have you brought? Out which half was canceled by you. And the other half canceled by your husband. This is not like that. Then? It seems that family is suited to us. Haven't you seen the girl? What is the age? That was told. In this December, 32 will be over. Your father in law is staying alone at house as a widower, no? Tell him to marry. 32 years of age. Then what do think what age you will get? Only okay, when received like that. Then what? Mamacho, do you know what is your age now? Mother, not because of that. After 24, 25 when our Christian girls remains at home... ...it seems there is something wrong. Then after 40, you are remaining, no? There is nothing wrong in that is it? This old lady won't let to drink rice gruel. Ho! My mother! What is it? That flow is gone! That is brother, mother is simply telling 32 and all. Good girl, brother will like her. Has the brother in law seen? No! Then nothing more to think. That idiot will cancel it. No, no need. I'm not there. Go, go! Shall I jump and come over there? Hey girl. Come here. See this. What is it mother? What? Allergy on flower. Looks like Pachan has come since very long. I came just now only. Then you should have called, no? I called. Didn't you hear? There was wax picker in the ears, no? Then how are the things? Come, will tell. Hey man. Yes. Jose won't lift his head again for some time now. Yesterday I've given such a task on him, no? Can I ask one thing. You instead of busting after Jose. Can't you become at least a ward member? Hey man, Pachan. I have entered into politics not just to become a mere ward member. All those things I've not dreamt in dreams. Not because the compatriots not allowing, is it? Hey man. You wait and see. When the DNC joins in any one of the fronts in... ...Kerala. On that day Mamachan will fly to Delhi. All that flying we will do later. Look, I've arranged a good task against Jose. Is it necessary, that fast? It's required. A thing that is not seen by compatriots so far. What is that man? Come, will show you. Is it so? Cleaning the courtyard, no? No fixing the porotta! What all things he should know. It looked like as if cleaning the courtyard. But still, I never thought he will do such a thing like this. Jose, how can you bear this? Jose, you drink this. Go man. Then all of you just move back. Just move back brother. Let Jose get some air! Have you informed the president? How can I say this to president? Before people starts gathering, Jose do something what is there to do. 'For Santhipuram-Jayagiri road' 'For allotting rupees 2 crores, DNC national secretary...' '...Saluting Mr. CP Mamachan' However a thing like this. At our junction it's for the first time. What? 'Plusk' (Flex) What? - Pluske... Why there are crowd over there? Look, written about Jose. Greetings. Hey man. How come there is a gathering over here? Lord, did Mamachan die? 'Death will come one day Remember that, you human being' 'Your actions in life Will also come along' 'Do the good deeds Without laziness' Leave the hand, leave the hand. 'Death will come one day Remember that, you human being' What happened to him? It was chest pain. What a pity! He has got one boy, no? Charley or something. Who knows where he is. Long back he has snatched Kunjukutty's radio. What time is it said the body will be taken? Jose! Come fast man. Have a sight on the coffin! Not on the coffin, must have a sight on you only. Here! Go and take man. Again Jose became an ass! Where is our wreath? Something bigger might have come. No need, no need to stand. Will go. - Okay. Urgently give it to newspaper office. Go. Jose! Come here. Did you inform Charley? - To where? When is the cremation? - At 10. Has gone to pick up father. Do one thing. Tell father to do the cremation at the evening. Let me search for Charley. Otherwise what is the use of saying a compatriot! By unloading 3 or 4 chairs and to tie a sheet and to drink soda. Anyone can do that. Tell father that I've told. Okay. Look, whom are you calling? Calling father. Mamachan told to change the time of cremation. Brother did you get high or what? Don't you know he is mad? What without cremating the person? Simply bluffing and gone. Come here. Will drink soda. Come. Why did you pay rupees thirty? A person without control. Brother! My dear brother. What did you do on her? Didn't do anything. Which is this item? - Sister only. Brother..Take me also. Take me also..Brother! What is this old lady saying? What? - To take her also. What, is he going on a tour to 'Veegaland'? No need to laugh and all. Learn that lying. Soon will have to lie. - Go man! Is everything over? - I had told to come early. There is no one here. Hey look! Will go. Going on reverse. Ho! You keep rubbing like this. Brother is going to leave. Go. Go man, to that side. Mother, I'm leaving. Brother just wait. Wanted to tell one thing. What is it? That is..Regarding the partition of the property. Thomacha! - Mother you keep quite! Brother has not told anything on it so far. What should I say on that? In my name there is no property to partition. We don't want anything which is in anyone's name. Just give, those ones which we have the right. Hey fellow, the agreement of the property is at the bank. Without clearing that debt, it's difficult to conduct partition. It's not that the debt can't be cleared off, it is not clearing it. Say what is my share? I'll give that. There is no use if you give anything. Not that what have you got to do, on dividing this now? Is it to boil it and eat? I'm looking for a transfer to a place which has got little more facilities. After selling this only, I can escape from this village. What to sell? It's father's property, I won't allow to sell this. I know very well what to do with my share. Stop it fellow! This house and property is in my name. Here you don't have a share. You go and give the case. There is lot of wealth with you, that is earned by you. With that you move apart. - Mother! You only have to move apart, no? Not obstinate that it must be sold. Will do the facility for that. - Not simply saying will do. Within this month something has to be done. Will do it fellow. - Come girl! Mother why did you talk like that? Not talked, was made to talk, is it? Started for a long time ago. Only the thing I've not told all this to you. Give it mother. Let him do what he likes. I won't give a single grain of sand to him. Right from beginning you had been struggling for this family. Then after he got a job and on being able to stand on own feet. Did he think of you? Elder brother was made to wait. Younger brother married. Now wants to stay separate. Here guy is getting old... ...and tooth starts growing through the nose. Mother! Keep this sack inside. Aren't you going to Trivandrum? For what? That flow is gone. Since dressed up like this. Will show it to compatriots and come. Hey you. Hey Mamacha. Stop there. Stop. It was father, no? Come Mamachan. Get on the vehicle fast. For what? Get on it. You get on it. Father tell the matter. You keep quite. I'll tell. Should I sit at the back? Why not I come in the jeep? No need, we'll go in this vehicle. Is it? Has the place reached? You just push. - What to push? Me? Never in my life, so far... Push man like that. Why man didn't you eat anything in the morning? My heavens! I forgot that. Then I'll go and eat something and come, okay. Mamacha, where are you going? Push man. Father only told no? To eat and come. A father who doesn't value the words. Throw this thing here and why not go walking? Mamachan, you are over weight, okay. Mamacha, come. Look, this is our community church. A good church. Is it to tell this father made me to push vehicle this far? So, you know that is it? Then there are certain things which you don't know. What is it? A thing like this is here for a very long time. On the intermediate days, holy mass one each. And on Sundays, two holy masses are the practice. No need to break the practice. On seeing your mother's sorrow. I gave her a word. That I'll bring you and make you stand in this church enclosure. I kept my word. Since it's father, can't scold also. Who are you to postponed the cremation of Mathanchettan? That is because to find this Charley. Then did you find Charley? No. One leader has come. This is some what an unfair play. He is the one who has not seen church after the baptism. Telling to change the time of cremation. Other than cremation can the church be changed? Pacha, you take some one's vehicle and come to the church. What at the church? Why do you want to go to unwanted places? Didn't you know. It's our father's burial. Burial? Yea, tell everyone. Lord, has the father died? (A Choir song) Hey man, what is all this? As Mamachan must place the wreath first. Without informing anyone. Came in full speed. By turning on the lights! Take this and place it. You put on your chest and lye down at that tomb. Why is that? When father scolded me, I just told out of that ill-feeling only. Look, don't show this kind of acts. Am I mad to buy this wreath with the money which was scarce? So you have got the money to buy the wreaths and all, no? On telling to charge this for Rs. 50, you don't have that. Which is this monument stuff? While purchasing this on the way of return, good condition, 84 model. More than that fancy number also. 1866! Looks like a new vehicle. Since we have come all this way, why not bless this one? First see whether this will travel and then you bless this. This one. Mamachan get in. Will I get septic? For you! What to do with this? Will keep it safe, some worthless fellow will die for sure! Now does this thing also require pushing? - Will correct this now. It's in a very good condition, is it? - Yes, yes. Hey man, which is that girl? I don't know. I've also wished only this much of beauty. Mamachan, that is too less. You are a problematic person, okay. Mamachan, it's regarding the case of going to Delhi. Will see fellow. Only this saying is there and then doing this slavery work. Then what about taking you to Calicut? Don't make me to talk. Then who else will say? In the hot sun, at Calicut town... ...four plus three a procession of seven people. You, decently inside the jeep. Don't laugh okay. Mathachan did a big cheating. What man? Should have died after the arrival of that son. For that he has not gone to Dubai for a job. He went eloping at the age of 12. No doubt why he became an opposition. Just move a bit to that side. Has come. Kunjukutty, one half tea. All of you, about whom are you gossiping? We were just saying things about that Mathachan... ...who died and was just laughing. Kunjukutty, after each day. The 'vada' is becoming smaller and smaller, it's like a marriage ring. All should only take the notice of 'vada' becoming smaller. No one should notice the hole in it becoming bigger, okay. That is true, look at this. I'm going write it in the account. What is the use of him coming here and drinking the tea? Why is that? Had an excellent wife. That one eloped with the black smith, no? Even otherwise earlier also she was a flirt. How many times she had come to flirt with me. He is a poor guy. But I'll blame him only. If it's male means there should be a control. That must be there. If the males doesn't have the control. If anyone lures the wife. Wife will go along with him. - That is correct. That is all my wife. My friends. If anyone comes home. Only half of her face will be seen. Get down. Careful. Careful. While fell in the gutter came and hit. The other half will be on Jose, is it not Kochappi? If you say unwanted things I'll hit you okay. Lal Salam. - Lal Salam is your father. A strong tea. I need a glass of hot water. - Let it be a boiling one. What is there to laugh on this? Jose where are you going? Has got some jobs at the panchayat. Yes, yes. Don't take the tea now. All the activities of the Jose are for the development of our panchayath... ...on thinking that, one relief. Jose is developing no? Who is this with Jose? That is our road contractor, no? This is some kind of dealings. May be some task against Mamachan. Say it's against Jose. All the tasks against Mamachan, will boomerang to him, is it? Why there is no light and all? Has he sold the house or what? Why mother has not slept so far? What happened? What for mother is crying? I've not cried and all. Ho! Were you laughing, weren't you? Where are they? - They, went to her house. The child told, will come only on day after tomorrow. What have you decided? Where he wants, will give 10 cents of land and money to built house. What else to do? While thinking the kids were taken. On taking the kids, what is use of jetting the mucus from the nose? My dear mother, you stop crying. Hey Mamachan, you don't avoid the marriage proposals like this. When I die, there will be no one for you. Avoiding? Me? The Lord won't pardon! On getting the right one, will marry now that is the situation. I'll set the rice gruel. My heavens! Before serving the rice gruel please see that the hands are washed! Go man you useless fellow! Started the program! This is as if lying in a government hospital. Thinking to sell the house and enclosure and go to somewhere. Telling uncle, what kind of an uncle is this any way? 'Big victory for the Trinamool congress' 'Including Kerala, in 5 states the election commission is going...' '...ahead, with the preparation of elections'. 'To increase Rs 5 per month for the cooking gas, the central petroleum... Who is this is it Cheguvera or what? Why man, why are you in this dress? That is today is our wedding anniversary. Is it? In the 11th party congress at the main entrance gate. When I was wearing this same dress and sweating at that time only... I and she met for the first time. That is how fell in love also, it is in the memory of that. How is it? Very good, great. Is the president in here? President. Come, come inside. Who is this Mamachan is it? Yea. - Why early in the morning? Just came to see the president. Look, go and take the tea. - Me? No need of tea and all, okay. That is a custom here. He has told he doesn't want no? - Go! What is that president what is in front of my enclosure... ...is it not a path? Or is it that I, don't belong to this panchayat? Why tarring is avoided only in that area? That, that is Mamacha, that is different two projects. Is it? Let me hear. Tea and coffee! Is this the two projects? That is not the thing, asking which one do you want tea or coffee? Coffee will do. Now its clear otherwise I'll get confused because of doubting. Then tea is it? That is Mamacha. From 'Tundipadi' to upwards one 200 metres. From the 'Alingathazathe house' to downwards one 600 meters. That is a special kind of project. In between this there is only my property, no? Which is 100 meters. Do one thing, for the time being merge the two and do it as one. That is not possible. There are lot of other problems which Mamachan doesn't know. So the things are like that. Then there are some other problems which president doesn't know. Shall I tell? - Do you have sugar? What? Not that, do what want sugar for the tea. My husband if he doesn't, want he'll say that. Not that generally those people who come to see you, they usually... mused to have a slight problem with sugar. Look! So the sugar is required is it? I'll put it okay. What is that Mamachan is trying to say? No nothing at all. That medical store license which is at Karthikapuram is still now in... ...president's name is it? Is it so? Think it is like that only. But during the time of election in the details of the property. That is not mentioned. Just take a look at this. Mamachan, where did you get this? The right to information. Trying to scare me by showing this? This is not a big deal is it? Like losing the head and all, No the head won't go but this job of president may be lost. I know its the brain of Jose. Tell Jose. Then I'm leaving, okay. Mamachan, What kind of a going is this? Drink the coffee. Nice coffee! For that didn't drink, no? Because of that only. I've made one stronger than this, to your wife. Tell that. Child get down. Hi, my children! Where is brother, mother? He has gone for the matter of your new house. No, need of that and all, now mother. Our transfer is ready now. - To where? For me to Trivandrum and for her to Muvattupuzha. Very soon she will get to Trivandrum. One of my friend is in secretariat. It was done through him only. Then what about the kids? That is a problem now. Since its at two different places. Will it be a problem to mother? What is the problem to me? Its only a problem of one month. After that she'll come with me till that time mother... Even otherwise kids love mother only. Yes, yes that you came to know that, now only is it? We must leave today itself. Shinny, make it fast. President. Local committee people have started asking now. What? Not that after marriage it has been 4 years now. Still now why has a little comrade not come? That's their question. What? - The decision is all presidents only. Look, all this is at home only. I'm her husband. This is panchayat office. Even otherwise there are thousands of complaints about you. What? Seen at the panchayat office in a suspicious manner. So that is it. All that time, Jose was there wasn't it? We've to talk. Go on talk. Hey man, you just go out. Is it? Can tell to go out from the room, no? Not that, my heavens! Josetta! Without shouting, listen to what I say, first of all. President, you don't say anything. On asking whom? Listen to what I'm saying. - Yea, tell. Morning Mamachan, had come home. When he came and showed just smiling... ...forgot everything that was done so far. No, not because of that. Our medical store's license at Karthikapuram is in my name. At the time of election we have not mentioned that one. How did he know this? Told something like the right of information and all. No doubt why village is not developing. Certain laws.. What is it? You dirty fellow aren't you ashamed to peep and look? Asking whether I'm ashamed to peep on to my wife? I'll look again. Anyway today I'll fix a hidden camera. Hey man, yesterday also saw. May be a bad dream. Her! Which her? That girl is there no? That we saw at the church. How come you haven't left that so far? Why can't we consider that? You consider all by yourselves. What is the use if I consider all by myself? Telling it must be considered by family. Then in that case it must be considered thoroughly. Don't con, okay. That girl is not that much aged and all Mamachan. Will be jailed for abuse. May be will be around 22 years. Will be 22 years. The way you say, will feel like you are not yet 24! My Mamacha... ...why don't you look into that case brought by Sally sister? Look, had told that she is a singer. At night can hear the songs and sleep. To hear the songs, I need to buy a tape recorder, is it? My heavens! What happened? - Excellent! Looks like uncle is dead. Come. What happened mother? The leg has got a cut. Looks like glass piece was struck. Let me see. Only this much! This requires a stitch! - There is nothing for that. Just rub with some leaves. In between this is there any reason to call communist people? This will get septic. He is a person with sugar and pressure and all, no? What is the surety it is struck by glass? May be bitten by a snake, no? - What, a snake? On getting the name which was bitten, can take out the poison. Can we get that one? - Try calling. My mother it is not, it is like that. May be like that, even if or not, there is a chance for that, no? Last year, almost by the same time. On the same leg, my uncle was struck by glass... ...had dinner and slept. Next day evening it was the burial. In the last moment there should be someone with father. You get inside the vehicle. Look, take this body. - Then hold it. Then no need, I myself will take it. Hold Mamachan. Mamacha! Do it by yourselves. Don't put me down. Mamacha, you don't come, I'll manage this one. Mamacahn, you go and see whether the... ...bitten snake can be caught. Go! Which was the snake that you said? - King cobra. Get in. Manju get in. Mother get in at the back. Child get in. Careful! No don't hang, if you hang and put the poison will come up fast. Slowly. Why are you tieing? Is it for the poison not to reach on top. No that is for the police, not to catch when seeing the cops, lift it up. Look, haven't you not gone so far? You come here. First of all buy some medicine for the cough, to that idiotic person. Look, have you got some money? Go man. Inform who are to be informed. Move the hand mother. Child give the hand here, must horn okay. Stupid fellow! What happened? Uncles leg got cut. Pachan, told its a snake bite. Which is the snake? Has declared an enquiry. The Pachan expert has told its a cobra. I was in the kitchen other wise I, would also have gone. He didn't take me, then will he take mother? Take this... ...lucky he doesn't die on a jeep accident, due to over excitement. Manju sit properly there. My child don't cry. - Go fast. I'm going fast, no? Okay press the horn. Don't be scared like this. Not regained the consciousness so far. The BP is low. Nothing to worry now it is in the observation. Anyway let him be here for few days. Okay. - Tomorrow we'll shift to the room. Then its good that you brought here on time. Father, did they put the stitch? No, if required they told to take a TT. TT is good. What Mamachan, told is true what he wants is the medicine for cough. Brother take this and put it here okay. Mamachan, do you know to play? Did you hear, became check no? That is it. This guy! Hey fellow. Snake charmer has come, is it? What happened to you on that day, were you mad? What all things were done by you? Go Mamachan, simply" Don't think I'm not knowing anything. Mamachan what did you mean? Come here. Do you know that Manju is my sister? Do you know how costly the rose flower is? I know. Then by plucking my flower are you blooming your flower? My dear Mamachan kindly pardon. Since you came to know the things you must be with me. Will remain with you but not because of the love towards you. Then? - Thinking that uncle can be given a task. Lot of my father's property is with her father. Once you get inside that house then the things will be doomed is it not? That I'll handle. Mamachan just be with me. Then can I tell a thing which is beneficial to you? What is that? Come will tell. Come. Why not tomorrow we go to see a girl? To see girl! From our area new people have come here, on changing the stay. One Kajirapalli person. The person is a contemptible fellow! But that person has got a daughter she is a nurse at Delhi. I'm more interested on that girl who was seen at the church. We can think about it. But before that, there is nothing wrong in seeing, no? No problem, but still more interested on that girl only. My Mamachan, I called her father telling I'm a broker. He seems okay but I've not told Mamachan's age and all. But anyway we'll go there tomorrow. But still saying, this nurse and all. Started. First go and see. Then the rest of the things are later, no? Even otherwise for... ...Mamachan's age nurse is the best. Again at this age what all diseases like sugar, pressure are yet to come. My Mamachan when marrying at an old age, there must be some use. That is also true. Is it a family that will suit me, man? Told no? Father is a contemptible fellow. What is boy's job? There is nothing as sort of a job. Some property is there and also some politics. That is good. The things out here has the broker told all that? No, that is... By the way, how come he is not seen...? Wanted urgently to go to a place, he has not come. The girl is coming. Where are you hailing from, the native place that you said? The native place is... One minute okay. Don't know who this one is? How is it? You are not Pachan, you are a Saint. Why have you not told this before? This is all Pachan's play no? When Mamachan sees in the mind. Pachan will see that on the tree. What more yet to see? Coming, coming. Had not drank tea, yet? - Yea. We are the natives of Kanjirapalli. - Where at Kanjirapalli? Over there its called 26. Is it? We are also from 26. Over there this Pakilomattom Cheriyan sir, everyone knows him. That is my father. Are you Mamachan, no? Yes, how do you know? At 26 one who was staying in your enclosure. Do you remember that Kunnel, Avaras's son Vareeth? Why not? I've whacked him long back, no? Where is he now? Let it remain there. During those times do you remember one Mollykutty... ...who used to come along with you, to school? Why not? As Mollykutty told only, I had whacked him. Those were the times. That loafer is staying there only. Don't look, come, come. Call his father! Is that needed? Then at least call him a dog! Go you dog! What dog? You stay there girl. Mamacha! Haven't I told, no? Mamacha, no need leave. You'll hold her hand is it? What is it? Is it tooth ache? Tooth ache? At that time I was very fond of Mollykutty. Don't know where she is now? On coming to Malabar, no news at all. Is here only! She is my wife only. Is that so? Then this Vareeth? - I'm the one! Excellent. Come. Sit there man. Something to girl... What is it fellow? There is no use of that. Anyway liked the girl. Anyway no need of much going and coming. Father you decide a date. Father! The girl who is going to be married her father is called like this, no? So are you the one who is marrying? Get up, fellow! Aren't you ashamed? Marrying a girl who is daughters age. Have come with a marriage proposal only, no? Get out from the house! On thinking the future of the child. Get out I say. Do I've to tell you separately, get out fellow? Get out! - Ho! No! Think once again or else will have to repent. Go I say. - No, need. Did you take only the 'Jilebi'? You fool. He threw out that 'achappam', no. What are you looking? Go inside. Mother is not bad, no? Go, girl. 'Waiting shed, Jaya Bharatha Kala Kendram - Santhipuram'. In this old age, certain peoples wish. That is not the thing, when the men get mad, will they do like this? I'll show this fellow today. - My heavens! Mamacha! He is mad, for not getting the girl. Come. Lucky that you called me, other wise would have vexed myself. There is no point in blaming them. Anyone will laugh on this. Yesterday on reaching home do you know how many times I, laughed... ...thinking on this. On telling this matter to mother, mother keeps on laughing... ...still now not stopped laughing. After father's death, I'm seeing mother laughing like this... ...for the first time. Did you get tensed? - Then what? Leave it Mamachan. If she can't be wedded, will wed her mother. You only wed her mother. - What me? What is the way to see her? That way is there on that day when we went to see the girl. Only that way is there. Will give one. Hey fellow just to talk. For that there is a way. - Is it the way which was told before? She goes to church every day. On going to church can see her. Going to church is a trouble some work. But on thinking she can be seen... The keeper of light Lend us the permission To light the lamp at the altar Let us open singing doors of wishes To know the kingdom of wishes Give us the permission Lord The prince of kindness.. The prince of kindness Gone! Doing rubbish inside the church compound fellow. Why, can't a phone call be made? Get out fellow. Told no? I'm going. Aren't you girl, with a smiling eyes? Aren't you a pearl, with beauty? Kindly write the love, divine creation During the festival at church On a silver chariot The happiness flutters and spills out In the sea..I'm a like a breeze Check! My God! Like an un faded flower Within the nest inside the heart With take care of you, lovingly. Will remain lingering in pain, by one self On the Athen valleys Slowly adds color to it Kindly leave. By giving kiss of sweet words She is my beauty of heaven Aren't you girl, with a smiling eyes? Aren't you a pearl, with beauty? Kindly write the love, divine creation Hey stop there, man. - Run! An unending river Which is full of song of soul The waves danced on kindness On telling your name "In the broth of love On the un seen shores" Give a handful of shyness The moon has bloomed from head to toe Aren't you girl, with a smiling eyes? Aren't you a pearl, with beauty? Kindly write the love, divine creation During the festival at church On a silver chariot The happiness flutters and spills out In the sea..I'm a like a breeze Mamachan also started to travel at the back. Even though got old he also has got wishes and emotions. After all he is a human being, no? Get down. Careful, okay. Brother, you have got high contacts in Delhi, is it? Why not? I wanted to ask one thing. - What is there in that? Then, I'm getting down okay. Mamacha, money? - No need you keep it. Don't worry you may ask. Asking the doubt to the right person! Not that what is brothers intention? No, there is no special intention like that. If there is intention or not? Kindly don't pester by walking behind me. Won't pester you. Just thought of seeing and talking to you. Moreover if there is any misunderstanding... ...we'll sit there and talk. To sit and talk its not a politics, is it? - No. Father, has told on that day itself, not interested, is it? Yes. This much age difference, will anyone allow? No! Even if I say I like, do you think father will allow? Don't know. Because of that to make people talk, by walking behind me, again... ...don't pester me. No. Sorry to say only. - Hey you! Hey you, dirty fellow leave my daughter. Stop there, fellow. - My heavens! What man? What do you want? Is it my child? Flirting with some stupid fellows. Go home, girl! On that day you were not beaten and send out from the house. That is because of my decency. What is the quality that you posses, man? By holding up the loin cloth and wandering to and fro is it? One politician has come, hey you! First of all try to become at least a ward member... ...and then think of marrying. Has come with a party which is not heard in the area. If you are seen in front of my daughter, again. You'll know the real character of Vareeth, okay. Didn't you see he caught on my daughter's hand? He and his politics. I won't leave him. - The shirt got wrinkled. Can't you go and die, man? Why are you late? - The vehicle came late. Then..Met that old friend of mother also. There is no sign of he leaving. Did he say anything, to you? For few days he is walking in front and behind me, is it? On seeing there was no way out, I told him to stop that. What did he say? - He is not the one, what we thought? A poor guy, only after saying thought it was not required. Did you say any non sense? - How? Will I say like that? After all, its mother's friend, no? - Okay, you go inside. In between that, father came in. Scolded a lot on that poor guy. Not that, I'm thinking why not I marry him? Mother what do you say? - Look, don't con, go inside. Mollykutty was struck! It has been 14 days as on today since you talked to me. Again if you show humbug I also know to show. On that day, why did you pretend on saying father was bitten by snake? So, your worry is that father was not bitten by snake is it so? Look. The way you look, will feel like I did it intentionally. Did it, thinking that there should be some respect in front of your father. Did I know it'll turn out like this? Not that... ...how is mother? Look, don't make me talk, okay. What is up? Will say after drinking. You go to that Esho-appan, and see whether military can be obtained. Okay then. Look, tell Vakkappan that I'm coming. Again when father sees you, he'll kill you. Then what? Killing! He doesn't have the guts for all that. (A p raye r) Look straight and pray. Children you pray father will come now okay. Lord, let there be 'MH'. 'MH' must be there. Here comes the 'MW. 'Kind Maria, salutations to you' 'Along with the Lord, you are also blessed' 'As per your advice, the Christ' 'Becomes the one who is blessed' 'Kind Lord, the sinners like us' Here. 'Always, at the time of our death' The item costing Rs.150, costing Rs 400. '...one which spoils the individuals and families...' '...the temptations on liquor...' Morning at the church he will be the first person to yell out. God, kindly protect. Otherwise no need, on first again have to come to the same place. Lord, forget it. (Playing a love song in the back ground) Stop it man. - One was put according to situation. Okay if you don't want, no need. Totally became ashamed. He verbally insulted me to the core. That too, in front of her. I know Mamachan, got upset. You leave that. That is because you are loving for the first time. Next time there won't be any problems. For the first time? Me? Hey Pacha, I have started this before you were born. Including your sister Jancy. I've loved 6 people. Since you are her brother that is why I'm taking you... ...all though you are an idiot! Mamacha! None among them did not mind me, that is true. Natural! After that no other girl has entered into my mind. God, has shown her to me. Otherwise what is the use of father pushing me to church? Because of that, I thought it'll take place. It will happen Mamachan. The marriage will take place in heaven... ...that is what is said in our Bible, no? Go man! Man, which is this vehicle? - This one...? This is 'Duster' a very good mileage. Not that, whose vehicle is this? Didn't you recognize him? Our Mathanchettan who died, it is his prodigal son. Long time back one who eloped and went, Charley. He has gone to Bombay and made lot of money and came back. Now after buying that 'Pettu Simons' house and enclosure... ...he is staying there only. Do you know who are the Charley's new friends? That Jose, uncle and that Kochappi. He should be like that only. 14 years. By dreaming this day only I slept on all other days. On coming back, thought everyone will be here. But... It's there Charley. - We all are there. Jose is it possible that you go head with this panchayat and all always? Trying. Its politics, no? Will see. Not that, here Mamachan has to be suppressed is it not? That is not as big as to suppress and all. Simply its a kind of show off. Then pour one more. No, no need. Stop! That is not possible. With consciousness for the head and strength for the limbs. No one should leave from here. While drinking should drink to the point... ...where the consciousness is lost. Otherwise don't try this task. Bring it here. Charley! Is it okay to carry on like this? After marrying need one family and all, no? To be honest, on this return there is also an intention like that. After finding a good girl and should marry her. On the flee to make money forgot to live. That matter we'll take care of it. - Yes. Our post man George's younger daughter is there, no? Why can't we propose her? She is the one who eloped with the boy at the St. George bus. She came back on the next day itself, no? I saw her brooming the courtyard in the morning. Then there won't be any problems. No, no all that won't suit at all. Our Vareeth's daughter is there no? Why not that girl, be proposed? That may not be okay. What is wrong in that? What is there he has got with him? That is not there. - That you leave it. How is the girl? A beautiful one. But nothing is there. A good girl. - That is what I also want. You just think over it. The girl is 10 sovereign gold. For that have you rubbed and checked? The own one still now not rubbed and checked that is still pledged. What is it? The only negative point is, Mamachan has seen the girl. On that day itself the girl's parents has told no, to it. But still Mamachan is after her only. Even if its broth of milk, if the dog licks its gone, no? You just try, the Mamachan's case I'll handle. Then come. - Where are you going, sit? Let us go and talk this over and come. That can be discussed tomorrow. - All this can't be left for tomorrow. You go. Aren't you coming? - You go and arrange it. I'll fix this one! Will it take place? Not yet finished man? Mamachan, will be over now. Brother you cut slowly. On going there is no other job, is it? Go man. Mamacho! What is the news? Has been long since seen. How are the things in Delhi? ls everyone keeping fine? Why not? Since your party men are not doing good in Delhi, there all are fine. Hey man, you come here. - What is it man? Why are you not happy? To be happy, your father has not died, no? Shall I tell one thing which makes you really happy? One girl is there which you wanted to marry. Which one? Our Vareeth's. Her marriage, we all have jointly fixed. Till so far, to all the tasks which you have given to me... ...just take it as a return to that. I can only do it this much. Then one who is going to marry her is not an old man like you. He is a youth! Charley, can you come till here? Look at the way he comes. This is the thing which I had told. Mamachan, a big guy! One who has invented Delhi. In the history of Indian politics. A chapter that cannot be omitted, that is what is standing here. Mamachan must help me. When my father died it was only.. ...Mamachan who wanted to inform me. Have searched a lot, haven't you? Mamachan, as you know I don't have anyone in here. Because of that. In the position of my father... ...Mamachan should conduct this marriage for me. Now, you are little happy is it not? Will see. Now what to do man? There is no time to think, if anything is to be done, it must be done now. That is what I'm also thinking. Now the tent has to be erected, should call the people. Charley, has delegated everything to Mamachan only. Those people who are to be personally called... ...Mamachan, they must be called like that. For some people when invited over the phone they won't like it. Go man! - Mother! Your father should be called. Why don't we go up to Delhi? - Is it to wed your father? Not because I wish to go to Delhi. She went back. Didn't you know? Can you give that soap? Rub With this. Slippers? Look, on going there no need to worry on Charley or her father. Can tell the matter and can be cleared. I think it can be done. Must call Saly. Brother. By compelling and calling brother didn't even talk. Has the child slept lady? If I tell a thing will you come to tear? You tell. Last week it was our 'Thekele Jimmychans' marriage fixation. As they had given the ad on internet. Do you know within 2 weeks how many proposals had come? Why don't we also give one ad like that? What is his age now? Don't you have any work at the kitchen? All that I'll do it. Answer me to what I asked brother. Hey lady, my age is not 26. You go and press two of my shirt and 'mundu'. Tomorrow very urgently have to go to somewhere. To press the shirts and 'mundu' bring one girl and tell her that one. No doubt why he was made to be here by getting old. From top angel will come. Angel and all won't be okay. Again, will it come? It was you. I thought it was your cut out placed. Why in this dress? - Don't we have to go? To where? To Delhi. - For that who has called you. For a help to Mamachan. Otherwise on seeing her Mamachan will be nervous. Won't be nervous. - Will be nervous. Won't be nervous. My dear Mamachan, don't say like that. Tell like that. Had told good bye to mother in the morning and had come. On going back immediately mother... ...will think Delhi is some where a nearby place here. But I've got only one ticket. Mamachan you don't worry on that, I'll hang somewhere and stay. It is leather. - Not leather. Its 'Khadar' Whatever it is for the Mamachan's get up all this is okay, no? Put the cloth pleats down. Release the breath. Remove that glass. Now hold this. Now I became the old, me, no? As per your height, only this is enough. Come. Take that bag. The first sight is any way good. Here comes your old lover. Should have married her at least by killing that Vareeth. Keep quiet man. Seriously preparing for a journey, no? We are to Delhi. - Up to here only. Up to here only. Why this way? Since coming after all these days, has not seen mother so far. Must come out in the time when he is not there, is it not? Yes, yes. Molly. On that day, I... ...coming to see the girl, that incident... ...don't tell mother. No, I won't. Mamachan, knows his character, is it not? Don't feel bad on saying like that on that day. L..Simply fought is it not? Okay, I'm going. What is that you were telling about fighting and all? Your sister Jancy! No, no need. Has reached. One minute. We are coming straight to there. Brother 2 Sasthamangalam. - This is not a bus, but an auto. On the way can you show that capital? That place I'll show you on reaching inside the room. This is Chandrasekharan Nair stadium. It was that one, no? - Have you seen it before? Hi, zoo! Sit properly man. Why don't we go after 3 or 4 days? You stay. I have some work, ongoing. What is this grave yard or what? - Keep quite. There is life. How much is it? Take the balance. What is there as balance? This only 20, no? This might be placed due to my arrival, no? What is the use of all this between us, Mamachan? You come here. Followers. - Greetings. Is Gopi there? - He is inside. Take the rest. Didn't you hear what the leader has said? Take the rest. Don't know which idiot is this? It was Mamachan, no? Now you are reading English and all. That is not for reading. While sleeping to protect from light falling on the face. As it is English, it will be really hard. Who is this? This is our boy in the youth. Understood, the district president. Tony Vakkathanam. Shall I order something cold? Hey fellows, if anybody is there without sleeping go... ...and bring 3 soda lime. But still my Mamacha, when that Swamy told... ...to sit simply as president. I never expected this much! There is no job at all. All that will be corrected. Somehow lets us get into anyone of the frontiers. Automatically the job will come. You wait and see in the tomorrows discussion something will happen. Well, very good if something takes place. Then tomorrow I won't be there, you go all alone. How can that be possible? I'm trying to make the things right through an another means. Through our 'Poonjattu' person a try to get into 'UPF' For us there is no rule that only left is suited. Then. That you at the 'Udayagiri panchayat' has arranged a rain... ...water harvest program, what is the value of that? Mmm..Out, out! So, no one has come to know is it? Ho! Its not at all a big deal at all. But still how much will be the value of it? Somewhat like 65 lakhs! Have you started digging the hole? Without the rain where to dig? Then in that case you start a project to start the rain. That is good. Will see to it. Then while sharing don't forget me okay. Okay, I'm leaving. Earlier also its like this, on taking about money your ears won't work. Blanket, blanket! Hello, Swamy! Swamy give me some work, by sitting idle here, root goes down. I was not late, no? You were talking something about rain harvest. That is because of rain there is holes every where only told that. That is not the matter. it is concerned with getting money. That is why told me to stand outside, no? Understood that much, is it? That is more than enough. Hello Tony Vakkathanam. Should not simply walk like this, our youth wing should be... Our youth wing should be made strong. Okay go, go. Mamacha, on one thing I'm thankful to you. After failing in 7th standard for the first time... ...one person is calling my real name. - Is it? Actually I didn't remember I had a name like this. But anyway really happy. Okay, then hold this. Come. - Then what about lime juice? Its simply a promise. Won't get that. Understood that one also, no? Please come. Pacha, put the phone down the comrade has come. Greetings. Have you reached long time back? - I came by 11 o'clock itself. Come. I thought of reaching by 11 o'clock but... ...in between, that Pillai came and made a cross. Pillai, says there should be no new candidates taken inside the front. To join with him there are lot of tiny leaders. At last on telling all will be thrown out, all kept quite. Its very difficult this system of united front. Lot of parties without any sort of ideas. And lot of leaders for it. Not that, comrade what about my matter? The moment when I took your... ...matter for discussion, then all started. VKP was the one who was dead against. You know all those things, no? Come. Anyway the things ended in a good manner. In the next front meeting you'll be there. I know for your party only there are leaders. All this is on account of relationship with you. At that time when Veeran left our front and went. The 'Thadi Thomas and Theyya' was plucked from... ...there and they were brought here. It was done by you only. During that time if you had not played like that. Everyone would have fallen by hitting the nose. Hey man can all that be forgotten? - Yes. Then what about the matter of seat? - There is a chance for one. Sometimes it won't be there also. For the seat which all filthy persons will do what all things, who knows. As the election is declared now all the toy snakes will raise the heads. You'll be here in the evening, no? Will meet. Not that must go to Delhi. - Convey my regards to Sharmaji. The matter of the seat will be decided within... ...a weeks time, I'll call. Red salute comrade. Truly! The Delhi is completely changed. For that have you seen Delhi? How? - In the movie New Delhi! Do you want to see the capital once more? - No! I don't want to see that place. While going to Sharmaji should sit respectfully and with modesty. Did you understand? Why can't these people chop all this and plant rubber? Here the rubber won't grow. That is why. Look there. - This is that China gate, no? India gate. Only gate is there, why there is no compound wall? Will you please keep quite. By the way there is no compound wall, no? Did you see it? Look! Nothing. Greetings Swamy. Was the journey fine? - Was fine. This is Swamy, he is the personal secretary of Sharmaji. Greetings. If we start now we can meet Sharmaji. Will be fresh now and come. - Carry on. - Come. Greetings Sharmaji! Hey Mamchand! Come man, come. Bless me. - I was waiting for you. How are you man? I'm fine. Who is this? He is our state president, Tony Vakkathanam. Oh! Good state president? Fall on the feet! Okay, okay. Okay, sit, sit. Sharmaji, I... - Okay, okay. Then...? In the Kerala assembly also we are going to have our representation. Well very good Mamchand. - Thank you. Comrade Murliji has done everything. Good. - Has conveyed regards to Sharmaji. Really great, look Mamchand. With me I've got lot planning for the parliament. But now the issue is, I've got an appointment with Home minister. You do one thing meet me in the evening at that time, I'll tell details. Will meet in the evening, no? - Okay. - Take care. Didn't see. Just like a Hindi film got over. Then what you told was all true, is it? What? - You are really great, okay. The idiotic compatriots are they knowing any of these things? Not that Mamachan, at the Trivandrum you told. I'm the district president while coming here, told I'm state president. Then when you go to America tomorrow will... ...you make me Indian president? That is the value of 'khadar' the positions will keep on gaining. There is no use at all. Come. Are you scared? For what? Just asked felt like, there is some sort of tension. Then why are you drumming with your hands? The hand is shivering that is why. Don't know what to do? - Don't do anything. Will you keep quite? - Okay then I'm not talking. Hey man when she comes I'll show some hum-bug. You should start talking. Come here. First you'll say don't talk, now you are telling to talk. Now should I talk or not? First of all tensed again are you putting more tension? I'll talk, okay. Here she comes. What to do now? - Why not we run? Be still man. When did you reach? - Yesterday. Today. Sit. - Its okay. This is Stella. - Mamachan. - Liza has told. Pachan. - Didn't ask! Sit. Sit, sit. Why no one is talking anything? That is because, you talk. What is the rate of one operation? Operation to whom? To some one! No, for anyone...if they wants. Is there doctor here? - Yes, there is. What about the attender? A very good hospital, a hospital should be like this. Then Mamachan, why don't we go? Don't sweat while standing. We'll move away. Come Pacha! We'll go. - Girl you may go. There no problem with Mamachan if I stay here. Go man, you stupid fellow! Became a nuisance, is it? Come here, you Pachan. Coming Stella. Sit. - Sit. What is this? With the black badge and all. That one, no? One of our nurse who was with us, died. Everything was ready for her to go abroad. But the management didn't allow. For that, that girl... My heavens! Wanting an enquiry on that demanding bond must be stopped... ...its a strike against it. That is good. For the first time a person from the native place to see me, in here. Well, I didn't come to see like that. Then when Pachan told you'll be here, thought of seeing. That is understood. What? Is it coffee? Brother, won't have come. The marriage should be with consent of parents. I've only that condition. Without their permission, I'll not do anything. What you told is true. Just wanted to see. That's all. Then just wanted to say something... I know brother loves me. Then mother also has told. You are a poor guy. All that is not my worry. Father won't allow. Has struggled a lot for me. Poor person. In father's dreams only I'm there. Not that, the over aged is a problem for me. Brother do you know? At the Kajirapalli one of my marriage was canceled. That is why father sold the property and came there. Just consider my proposal has not come. If you need any help just call me. Here. Then I'll take leave. The nose of Stella is what I liked. Then what about Manju's nose? Tell Manju to go. We'll go, no? - We are going. Then will meet in the next visit. There is no next visit. - Shall I go Stella? Go fellow! Mother! Both of you are here. Hold this. Why have you come here, without informing? What is it? What happened? Where is brother? - He has gone to Delhi. Where are the kids? - They have slept. When is brother coming back? Will come back after 3 or 4 days only. What is it? Tell what the matter is? Mother don't you know anything? You tell what the matter is, clearly. Do you know who has transferred me and her to 2 different places? Mother's dear son, Mamachan. No, no he won't do anything like that. Don't make me to talk more. Come lady. What a pity is this? When is your next return? Before the marriage, I'll reach here 10 days before. Hello, tell where are you? Are you at the hostel? We must rock the marriage. Then I'll kill you. I intended this marriage should be blasting. That is utter cheating, hey man to the alcohol drank... ...must show thankfulness at least. Hey man what I told is this must be conducted... ...in a good way by celebrating. Tell like that. After drinking don't talk to me like un educated people. Will you people keep quite? What happened? Searching her that filthy guy has went there, today. Who? - Is it that Mamachan? He has become a big nuisance, now what to do? Will see. Charley, you go boldly. We will deal with him. After chopping him to pieces only after that we will meet again. Who will chop? Okay, if you need anything, just call me. Key! On thinking what have you told you'll handle Mamachan? By drinking his alcohol... ...must say something to please him, what do you say Jose? Have you got shame? For a long time both are babbling. Mother! Mother! Why is mother looking at me like this? Thomachan had come. How is he doing? Told, how he got the transfer and all. But still this much was not required. My dear mother he only told he wants to live separately. Then to go immediately, I saw only this way. Then why didn't you transfer both to one place? Then things will be different... ...he would have taken the kids and gone. Mother only told no? Can't stay without seeing the kids. In this case it will serve both the purposes. Mother go and take one tea. 'The decision was not taken today, the bars will remain closed' 'There are chances of a big re shuffling in the central ministry' 'Kenna, with great expectation' 'This time it is noticed that Kerala will have a major role in the ministry' Go girl! She can't be blamed, also! Mamachan, come. We reached 10 minutes back. Knew that. How come a sudden visit? The election is the topic. Do you know how many seats we may get? There is only a chance for one. Is there any idea who the candidate is? That will be me only. In the coming day, district committee is called. In Kerala as the new situations has emerged. Sharmaji, has got some other plans. In the next term ministry expansion there will be a minister from Kerala. The plan is to bring it to Rajyasabha from youth. Either Mamachan or Gopi. That is what Sharmaji, has told. You both are alike to party, no? Now I'll tell my suggestion. Tell. Mamachan at Delhi and Gopi staying here that will be good. What do you say Mamachan? - Okay then. We can ask Trivandrum south, no Gopi? Okay ask. In that case let Gopi go for the fronts meeting in the evening. Try hard for the south. Now there is no difference opinion, is it? No. Then everything as told. Mamachan see you at Delhi again. Comrade, what kind of an action is that? - What? While asking Trivandrum south, gave 'lrikkoor'. Who asked? Yesterday Gopi was only crying and demanding wants lrikkoor. GOpi? That is because as that... ...constituency chances of wining is more. You don't worry man. All though its a sitting seat of KP. On trying hard that can be gained. - Yes. It has been more than 30 years, no? The people might have got enough of it. Why not? Might had enough. Any other constituency. - I've told what I can. The rest you people do. 10 to 15 parties and one seat. I'll... - Might have had enough. Comrade. Friends, after the formation of DNC Kerala unit. For the first time we have obtained a seat. Because of that this election as far as we are concerned, its very vital. We've received 'lrikkoor' where the chances of winning is more. There, we must find a strong candidate that is my opinion. Instead of lrikkoor, I'm trying for some other constituency. Yes, yes. - What for? At lrikkoor our wining is sure, then why thinking... ...of other constituency? That is purely foolishness that is my opinion. That is true. - What I mean to say is... There is no issue. Our party is contesting in the lrikkoor constituency. That is true. In that case, in this situation I'm recommending Gopi as a candidate. That is true. How can that be? - That is okay. I'm a person who is outside that constituency. Its better that one person who is from that constituency... ...should be the candidate. - That is also correct. You tell one among them is correct. - That is also correct. So that is the correct side of that. So because of that in the lrikkoor constituency. As a candidate and people's choice... As one who is dear to all I declare Mamachan. That is correct. - All of you clap. The meeting is dispersed. 'That is correct', you go home. All of you go. Phone. Wait there, wait. - I'm also coming. What have you done? - What is it? You should have stood, no? That is what we have decided is it? All that doesn't matter is it about thinking on things in Delhi? You don't worry and that I'll handle. You are wanted by the people of lrikkoor. I don't think there is any need for it. Its only when I win, no? Mamachan, I'll make you win. Kerala, is the hot bed of elections. Both the parties have declared the first list. In the lrikkoor, for the left un expected candidate. DNC national secretary, Mr. CP Mamachan... At lrikkoor, is the leftist candidate. At Trivandrum the DNC state secretary Mr. Gopi has... ...declared Mamachan as their candidate. Our Mamachan? So its true that he is national secretary is it not? Irikkoor is the only seat of DNC. This Mamachan is a real big thing okay. When saying a MLA and all, then what is he? Who? - That after wining in election. That thing is received, like this there will be red light on top of the vehicle. For that doesn't he have to win? - Must win. Jose, now you are the same front. From tomorrow onwards... ...must ask vote for Mamachan. - Who? Me? - Yes. My dog will go. - Okay with that one also. On this election our party won't be having any work. Then his party is it not contesting this time? That is not the thing. - Then. As per Mamachan's character, not a single vote will be received at least... ...from his house. Okay comrade. Is it from tomorrow onwards? I'll be there. Who is it Jose? From the district committee. - Lucky she is not the one. From tomorrow onwards must start the election work. This is something like being caught inside the rat trap. When? Can't take it out and must walk with the rat trap. There is no other go, than carrying it. What is the use of getting angry on me? Better than this was suspension or degrading. No, not reached. - We are in the same area. How to go without seeing? Lord, anything for the mother? What happened? - Nothing has happened. To meet the MLA candidate everyone has come. This is the person. Mother, brother has come. How is the set up? Brother. - When did you come? We came on hearing the news. Brother, tea. Tea! How is it? Are you happy? Come here. Who told you to bring them all to the house? Must send all of them. I just for a show off, to make a pomp. Did it become an issue? People are mad out here. What is it? Mamacha, my dear son hats off to you! Come will serve you coffee. See, see. - I'll show you now. Hey man, on wining here the things in Delhi will go out of hand. That stupid Gopi is waiting for a chance. Which means? - We must fail. Then don't you want to become MLA? MLA? ls MLA out here or MP in Delhi which is big? MP at Delhi. So, Mamachan must fail. That is easy no? Will anyone vote for you, who knows you. Should have thought of it before. - What is it? When checked before. The bad mark which was created here... ...it could be spread to whole of this constituency. Give you one beat. Will eat the food prepared by mother and we'll think of some ideas, come. Will the item come? This is not the item which comes like that, I've tried my maximum. Before coming, will become in mood. You pour one more. Looks like its him. Move all this fast. Jose, come. Come inside. Sit Jose. Sit Jose. What do you want to drink? - Nothing is required. Then, why I called Jose is... ...that is to tell about the matter of Mamachan. That I felt so. Jose should really work hard. That is to make him win no? My dog will work. What if Jose is also benefited? Even if you say will give rupees one crore... ...I'll not get a single vote for him. One crore is not there. But few lakhs are there. Here. Take it. - Tempting people, is it not? What should I do? That is told by Gopi. There are no cameras here. From your panchayat not even a single vote should go out. Then to the maximum put the people and all over... ...the constituency do the campaign. That's all. If it were that not even a single vote should be gained. That will happen, we don't have to do anything... ...just fold our hands and watch and see. This is like, bit tough. My Jose I know that that is why I, delegated this to Jose, only. If Jose intends, it will take place. There is no surety and all. Will see to it. My dear Jose. If Mamachan fails here then we can't hold him then. In the central ministry there will be a nomination from Kerala, of DNC. While failing he will get the chance. Because of that at any cost he'll try to fail in here. But to make him win, that is my necessity, now. In the middle of this is there a game like that? Then you must say that no? This I'll manage. I only wanted to hear that. Then shall I go and start the work? - Okay then. Every minute is precious. - Yes, yes. Money..Take care of it. Don't know whether there is camera kept anywhere. In Just pour one. - Its ready. Jose whatever you say, this we won't allow. You listen to what I'm saying. Now what you told is okay. Again don't tell this one. Not that, what happened to you Jose? - My dear uncle... Might have received money from Mamachan. - That is it. Is your wife working for Mamachan? Why is that? Otherwise Jose will not say like this. Look my wife is panchayat president, not panchayat pipe. When any problem comes, to come running over to there with the pot. All that is not the problem out here, no? How did Jose get turned? Anyway I've decided to work for Mamachan. Those who wants to go can go. - Jose, is that so? We've got only one word. We are not there for this dirty work. - That is it. - You come. - Lets go. Mamachan is a Malayalee, more that that he is our compatriot also. Then for Mamachan, other than us who will work. Jose will not do anything like that without seeing anything, I'm sure. Then Jose what is our future program? We are breaking! - Who? The bottle we are breaking. - Then what about Mamachan? We'll win Mamachan. Then start the actions. Started. - Pour fast. Look, silver owl. Okay man, bus will come now. You may go now. Mamacho! - Who is that? What Lalettan? No, its Josettan. - Oh! It was you? Where is Mamachan on a journey? - Just for an 'agitation on salt'. Why? Are you joining? What man morning itself you are in a debating mood? What is it, if so? From now on we should jointly work. - Is it so? Mamachan you don't worry. - We are all there with you. We will make you win. - Indeed! What if, I don't want your help? This is your problem. Your character is like kids. Inside its neat. You be prepared to win. We've started our work! Mamachoo! - Mamacha! Where to? - Somewhere! Ho! Jose! - What man? Nothing. - Nothing? Then get in. Will go. - Get in man. Got in. After Maveli..Only you are there. If you convince all men Then you are the leader After Maveli..Only you are there If you convince all men Then you are the leader One who makes promises to his fancies One who does magic is always the winner Brother! - Don't be scared, that's only a chisel. Those men who has succeeded.. Our candidate..Mamachan! They had over turned the truth When vote and seat is more. Ones own matters are the first priority After Maveli..Only you are there If you convince all men Then you are the leader Come on man, without shyness. Go man, contemptible fellow. Contemptible fellow is your father. - Calling father! Stop there fellow! To make money Will catch hold of right party For your shade Will catch hold of a flag To canvass the vote Will take the aid of laughter By laughing will take the life out To make money Ready to do anything Politicians will pile on the nation Then will go fleeing Old man who is dead Must flatter him maximum For the marriage and initiation ceremony To show off you must attend You were here, no? - Go dog. We came here in the morning. The house owners have gone to Palani. Will be back after 2 days. Dear comrades, during the time of election. There is no political enemies for us. Because of that with the religious, communal leaderships. Either cooperating or on meeting there is nothing wrong. Not that Jose, what is Mamachan's stand? Some what relaxed now. Something must be done. That we will manage. Do one thing. From tomorrow onwards for Mamachan's campaigns... ...myself and Prathapan also participates. Prathapan has chartered everything. According to that everything will happen. Okay shall we disperse? For today will disperse. After Maveli..Only you are there If you convince all men Then you are the leader Mamacha, you take the child. - No need. You keep it. Will come and take it afterwards okay. The body is getting numb The heart is beating vigorously The election has come near. Who will rule. Who will ruin the country? "it is a evaluation heather and sketcher" When the vote comes to the box When all the votes are counted and on passing The promises are tied in a sack Thrown in a corner that is not seen Are hidden away from sight. And will smile. You too Then, who is the one who fails? Its the people who is giving votes For the leader and for the winner Ones own matters are the first priority Dasappa? Who is that one? If you come inside, I'll chop. Has come asking for vote. After Maveli..Only you are there If you convince all men Then you are the leader One who makes promises to his fancies One who does magic is always the winner Those men who has succeeded They had over turned the truth When vote and seat is more. Ones own matters are the first priority Requesting vote for Mamachan, the opponent candidate. He and his... Today also won't be there? Then what to do? Okay, let me see. Okay, I'll call. - Jose, just take this. Let it get cool. Why is the face different? Little tight. Gopi, is telling to roll from somewhere. If Gopi has said nothing to look, just roll. On saying to roll, to roll this is not 'dosa' its money. Yes that is it, its money then there is only one way out, Sholy! Anyway I'll not get. But if Jose asks will get. Must ask in a decent way. Will get it. She will give. - What? Just ask her chain to pledge. Give this there. Money I'll arrange from somewhere. Simply to make the people talk. What to make the people talk? What did he mean? Mamachan, this is church. Have you come here wrongly or what? No, father. - Its election no? For that Lord has got no vote man. That I know. - Then? Father I must confess. In the state its the final toll of campaign. In the 140 election constituencies, making the final campaigns rocking. The members of the both parties are ready now. In the state the election campaign comes to an end. All over the state the final round of... ...campaigns were really full of excitement. Jose, how was the final ceremony? Its was an ocean of people. The central minister Anand Sharma. And others got shocked? Do you know what Sharmaji, told? Mamachan's public support was astonishing. Public support? Did Mamachan oppose? - Was fully active, no? Can't be otherwise no? To Mamachan's left and right... ...Gopi, Prathapan and I'm standing, no? As the ceremony has ended what should we do next? One more work is pending the last nail on his coffin! Father... - Who is this new saint? Why all the leaders at mid night? How is the campaign going? - Finished. The matter I, told yesterday? The reply for that I've given yesterday itself. Not for Mamachan for any other person, there won't be any... ...canvassing from the side of church. Then what is the use of bringing all this men and coming? Not that, when we say its not like how Jose says, no? That's it! What do you have horns? When father announces... - Politics is not my job! My job is to take care of the spiritual matters of the people. Not that even the Bishops used to have certain political stands. Not hunger, Bishop. You just say Bishop! - Bishop! Enough, enough. On telling to Mamachan, a big amount can be... ...given to church. - From Mamachan's hands, no? Last time when going for mission collection, he is the one... ...who gave the 'rubber milk' Not that father, as Mamachan is our own person... ...father you just say without detailing. To say without detailing? That is, to say, don't say. Then if it is don't say, then say. Then no need to say? Must tell. - What he said, don't say? That is I've suggested a pattern to father. Okay let me see. - Then announce for 3 masses. To announce 3 times is it a marriage or what? Not like that, but for a this. - Okay, all go, go, go! Come, come, hammer is there in the hand. That is his parties symbol, no? 'Salutations to the altar of sacrifice. Salutations to the tomb of our Lord.' Father tell, please. Not telling! The mass which was received by us today, for subduing our debts. Let it be a reason to liberate from sins. We do not know whether we will come again or not for a sacrifice. Didn't say. - Didn't say. All of you must wait for a moment. Dear ones, tomorrow its election. Let it come out like that. We must elect the best ones which is suited for our country. The Mamachan as he is from our church's jurisdiction. As you all are aware he is the candidate in our constituency. Mamachan has asked to all of us to help him by praying. We can all pray one minute by closing the eyes for his success. Kerala, goes to polling booth today. To 140 constituencies the polling will start today morning by 7.

Come. In 140 centers the counting of the vote will start from the morning 7. By 9 first results will come out, opts main election officer. Gopi thinks something will happen. On opening the ballot box... ...Can see Mamachan failing. Keep quiet man! Okay GOP'-. Now over to the news which is received just now. To the 14th Kerala assembly elections first results came out. With the 4 seats the UPF is leading. Haripad, Mala, Neyyattinkara, Pala on these... ...constituencies when UPF won. Thalassery was maintained by LPF. At Manjery, KK Ahammed Kutty of UPF had won with... ...a lead of 50,000 votes. In the constituencies of Ernakulam, lrikkoor, Adoor, Calicut, Cherthala... UPF is maintaining a clear lead. All together it is in their support. Will it go swayed? Both the parties are advancing neck to neck that is seen now. Till now its not clear who will rule Kerala. Out of the results which are declared in 130 constituencies. Both the parties have won 65 seats each. In the remaining 10 seats, leading in the 5 seats each. At Piravom K Surendran won with a lead of 3,000 votes. At the Puthupalli, the UPF's... All the eyes on lrikkoor. Irikkoor will write the verdict of Kerala. In 139 constituencies where the vote counting is complete. For the LPF 70 and for UPF 69 seats. At Kerala there is a chance of hung parliament. At the lrikkoor UPF candidate KP Joseph wins. At the lrikkoor the lead position is changing. At lrikkoor when 80% of votes are counted. UPF candidate KP Joseph is winning than the opponent... ...CP Mamachan with 3000 votes. At lrikkoor KP Joseph is contesting election for the 6th time. For the last 5 times he had won. When 90% of votes are counted. The lead of UPF candidate KP Joseph is... We'll watch some movies. Mamachan, just leave your breath. They are leading. This time Kerala is for the left. In the lrikkoor constituency, waiting for the results. When 98% of votes are counted. CP Mamachan of DNC is maintaining a lead of 2000 votes. At the lrikkoor, what is ending is 30 years... Where is that remote? By rewriting the history the LPF is coming to power for the 2nd time. Did Mamachan hear that he failed? Swamy anyway our game worked! Now there won't be any change, there is a lead of 2,000, no? At first simply just got shocked. Gopi has got no doubt at all, he is strongly with me. I'll manage without having any problems to Swamy. Swamy, has got lot of thanks. I'll call. Mamachan did you hear the news clearly? They are saying we have won. So what? - So what? You only told... Comrade, thanks. Happy, lot of happiness. Little busy, shall I call you back? What did you say? - Won! Hey man did you know to win how much I struggled? Mamacha, you only told. - Please... Sharmaji. Thank you. Thank you. I'll talk later. Give it here. You and your.. Hey man you only told... ...by failing here, can go to central. Me? When? Other day to Jose. That I told simply. - Told simply? Till yesterday you were not saying this one. Hey fellow what all difficulty in securing a seat, do you know that? Then at that time Gopi wants that. Then at that time I simply created this central minister story. Then at the central nothing is there? At the centre the eggs are boiled and kept! Why was that poster torn and abused that Jose? Did I say that? - Said! Then sorry. Hey Pasha! When we try to fail. They will try to make us win. Their line is to harass, no? Even other wise to win an election how much money is required? If at all anything is received from the party fund, half of it will be... ...snatched by Jose and others. Now since the Jose's wife wedding chain is pledged, we are relaxed. Then what about Gopi's case? - Gopi's case is gone! Come. I'm not coming, at least you should have told me, no? First I thought of telling you. - Then? Then, I thought no need of it. In the acting since you don't have much experience, as I do. You will have a sly look. They will catch that also. My first vote is simply wasted. Its Maiden vote, no? Its not virginity, no? Mamacha, can I believe this at least? Or will this also...! Believe me! Then we must celebrate this. They have started the celebration, no? Then we will rock this one. Hey fellow put it down. MLA. When I went to Bombay what all things happened here? Even by hitting Kuttichan and jose, they won't look eye to eye... ...they became friends. Mamachan became the MLA. Not became, he was made. You only told Mamachan will be beaten, killed and all. That was a different game played by us. If he doesn't win here he will go to central, will we leave? Is it not Kuttichan? You should be really appreciated okay. We won't accept that. Is it? - Then what? Then I'll leave. At the house of the Vareeth tent construction has just started. Okay. Okay. Morning I'll come here to dress up the groom. Shall I go? - Okay then. It will be ready, let me see what the comrade is saying. Look, here comes the comrade. - Hey Mamachan. Don't we have to sit? - What is there on that? When you are free, come to the office. We will discuss rest of the things. All that let the comrade decide and call me. Okay then carry on. A kind of despotic look! What is there? You just stay with me. When we stand united that is benefited to all. Did he go? What are you thinking? Today it is her fixation. The brain used by you to win this election... ...if you have showed one out of hundred... ...today she'll be there at your house. This is all like this man. We will desire a lot. Some we will get some we won't get. The more we wish on anything that won't be gained at all. That is life. Leave it man. Everything will happen. For you one person will be waiting. You wait and see. Lie there! Look, on going home the house was locked. Has checked the entire area place Charley is not seen anywhere. MY Lord! Jose! - What is it Vareeth? This proposal was brought by you and now where is he, fellow? Hey Vareeth! Be calm Vareeth! Father, how to be calm? This is the second time my... ...daughter's marriage is getting canceled. Charley won't do like that? - If he won't do? Where is he then? Leave! You were the people no? Who was with him for 24 hours. Now are you justifying him? Since I was with him, what can I do on it? I'll show you. - Leave Vareeth. Come here what is this man? You should answer this. - What can I say? Just to be little Mamachan, I stood with Charley that is true. But father I didn't know he'll do such a thing. You fellows are you playing with a girl's life? Father! - Vareeth, you don't get worried. Lord, will show some way out. You tell the matter to the child. Don't cry. - Father, what will I say to my child? You go there. Don't cry. Its my fault. Without checking what he is, who he is, father has fixed this marriage. I never asked what is your opinion. Everything is my fault. Please don't cry! Don't cry! Not that, Vareeth has not told anything. Why, are you all gone mad? What father is saying my daughter... ...should be married to this Mamachan? Hey fellow! He has studied with my Mollykutty at school. Father, how much is the age difference between... ...my child and Mamachan? You should not tell the calculations of the age to me. Virgin Marry at what age did she marry father Joseph? Do you know the age difference between them? I don't know. - Okay leave that one. Our AK Antony in which age did he marry Elizabath? That is what is said, there is no point in age and all. The point is on, how they live. That is not required father. Now since her marriage is canceled. I just can't put her on some one's head, just like that. I also have hard feeling with him. But in this situation what father told is correct, is it not? Now as Vareeth told now, Mamachan is not just a silly guy. He is a MLA now, now he is the deciding factor, on the topic... ...who must rule in Kerala. That let him decide... ...but who should marry my daughter, that's decided by me. My Vareeth, I know you have a slight ill feeling towards him. But still saying, he will take care of your child, in a very good manner. On this earth it will be Mamachan who loves her to the highest. I've seen his heart. As its a confession secret I can't say more on it. You must know her soul. I'll talk to Mamachan. Father, for the time being you don't talk to him. Behind canceling this marriage... I've got a clear doubt whether its Mamachan. Hey lady! Why are you not saying anything? What all things are told by your father! God will punish okay. If it were to cancel your marriage. Mamachan, could have done that much before. At that time when there were that much problems at the hospital. I've called several people for help. There was no one present at that time and in the last I... ...called Mamachan. During that time when Mamachan and all came to Delhi... ...told about the death of a nurse, is it? We were all on a strike demanding an enquiry. But now.. - What happened? The hospital management, Liza and all in hostel room. They are all locked inside. Didn't you inform police? The police and all is on their side, can you do anything? I'll handle it! Including the minister all had come there... ...that is because Mamachan has told. No one should know anything that is what Mamachan has told. That is why I've not told this matter to you. In the name of father, son and holy ghost... Look watch and learn. Will he ruin it? Hey what is this? Anything to drink? - One half is there. Then shall we go? Okay. Happy that you had come. - As it is a good day. Will tell a happy news. - What is it? Greetings to the newly appointed sports minister? Sports minister? - What is it? Can't you believe? Didn't I say that on hearing this Mamachan will be shocked? Comrade don't feel bad, I'm not there to become minister and all. How can that be possible? This is... ...this is decided by the front. All that won't suit! Pacha! One minute. Arrange the set up for the comrade to have food. Comrade you may go. Lal Salam (Red Salute) The same to you also. So he was not shocked, no? May be he might not have understood. Don't you know him? - Why not? Who is he? From 'Karippa Parambil' - Yea, yea. This was not required. Take one photo. Girl, give one kiss. Hey man, I've called and said on your transfer, okay. By this week there will be a transfer to this place. Then no need to delay much. I'll put the bag in the car and come. Okay, okay. Will go. Thomachan, is really happy. He thinks that you have done a big help. Why not? Hey boy, now you will at Trivandrum so mother need a company, no? That is the reason why you had transferred him to here, no? He is such a fool like this! So mother understood everything isn't it? For more than 40 years I've been taking care of you, is it not? But anyway you love your mother, no? That is always there mother. Shall I go? Come girl. How is it? Has started... Hey man kept everything is it? Hey boy, when are you coming back to here? Yes, on seeing uncle's cough, it seems must return in this same car. On becoming whichever big minister, don't forget your father. When I say must not steal, you won't listen. But you should not gulp everything by yourselves! Should do something for the betterment of the country also. Did you hear? - Will try! He won't be good! Daughter you must make him good. Will tell all that later. Okay then. - You get inside the car. Hello, when the snake bites they will inform. Now, let the snake charmer get inside the car. Kochappi! Have an eye on Jose, okay. Okay, bye to all. Say bye to uncle! Bye uncle. - Bye. My dear sir, I've told to comrade that I'm not interested. There is no change on that. Okay, again will meet at Trivandrum. Why did you say don't want to become a minister and all? That is sports, no? What is the gain on it? I'm interested on revenue! But still on getting a good opportunity like this. You wait and see they will again call. Other than me who will do the oath? If its revenue means can really grab! Both will be happily going to take the oath, is it not? Then who is me? My dear sister, I'm this devils friend! I know what I did is extreme, don't keep anything in the mind. This Mamachan likes you that much, that is why. To call and tell me to play such a foul act. That is due to severe love. I was damn sure on it. When a friend is in need, at that time only we have to help, is it not? Has got some cheap acts with him but he is a good person. Like this there is one item in my house also, at that time this... ...Mamachan has helped me. My name is not Charley and all, I'm Josekutty. Josekutty? - A planter from Pala. Achaya, after all the busyness, both of you must come there. Sister, don't keep anything in the mind. Okay then Achaya. Don't waste time, you may go. I'm also going, okay. Okay fine. Achaya, forgot to tell you wish you a happy..Then no need of it... One beautiful life, okay. - Okay then. Then shall we go? Excellent! This beating is required to me! I've done such an act on you. If I wanted, I could have hidden this. Then felt doing that also towards you is not correct. You might not have heard anything good about me, Charley..No! Like what Josekutty said, I also know what is done is bit extreme. Mamachan, didn't marry so far not because of getting any brides. Only because, has not seen anyone that is liked by the heart. While on seeing it, didn't feel like losing that one! Even though the age is a bit over, I'll very well take care of you. Whatever it is, I'll not cheat you. If you can pardon me, pardon or you can beat me again. After taking the oath, then there will be bad name on beating a minister. Okay then, shall we go? Get in. Hey dear worth less fellow, I never thought you are such a cheap! Son Pacha! Didn't get mother. So? If its daughter, okay with daughter. Mamacho! - Excellent! I, CP Mamachan.
