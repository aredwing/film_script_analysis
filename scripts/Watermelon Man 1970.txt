It's the 3rd such outbreak in this area this month and reflects the unrest that has plagued the area since early last year when similar conflagrations arose all across the country... Morning, troop. Hello, sweetheart. Hey, Burton. Should another such incident occur, he would be compelled to ask for special federal riot troops, an action that no one wants. Least of all, the White House which has been hopeful that such disturbances were over, at least for the time being. That's got to be the smallest screen in the world. They look like ants. They're getting very dangerous. A screen that size ought to only have 15-minute shows. [CHUCKLING] Get it? Small screen, small shows. You said that yesterday. You didn't get it yesterday either. It wasn't funny yesterday any more than it'll be funny tomorrow. Critics everywhere. Aren't you concerned with the civil rights issue? Yeah, sure. Most people are just crazy. They think at any moment a negro's gonna hit 'em over the head with a watermelon and steal their high school ring. I think white people have to show greater interest and understanding. How else-- Look, aAlthea. Your bus will be coming by soon. I'd like to give 'em a head start. Makes a contest out of it. It is now post time. Thank you, my dear. Off to another smash week in the insurance gig. I want you to know that I feel I'm leading a boring life. I am so advised. You were so advised yesterday. It wasn't funny yesterday either. Don't kiss me. I wasn't gonna kiss you, it's just that my shorts are too tight, that's all. Mommy, can we watch daddy run out the door? No, you may not. Oh, boy. There goes your stupid bus.

[CHUCKLING] Shows you have good taste, lady. Fare, please Arrogant, arrogant. They're all arrogant. In the good old days, back in the old south, you'd have to drive from back here! [LAUGHING] Get it? Back of the bus? Why don't you take all the money you save racing this bus and race a cab? (JEFF) That is very funny. [JEFF LAUGHING] Hey, driver, you hear that? I'm only good for short distances. 100 yards, maybe. But over a long haul, they just don't have it in 'em.

[sighing] what are you trying to prove with all that running? don't bug me, althea, i had a traumatic day. 13 appointments out of 15 calls. [chuckling] (jeff) is that all you watch? race riots? what are you, perverse? it's an important problem. (male newscaster) ...was announced that should a request be made for federal intervention, army units would be immediately made available-- i was watching. i'm gonna have my dinner without watching a bunch of uppity darkies jigging up and down on my t.v. screen. why are you so hateful? i'm not hateful, and don't start telling me i have a personality problem. i said no such thing. i merely tried to point out that there's an issue in this country today that has to do with the equal rights of man. what kind of dinner is this? what kind of dinner is this, huh? eskimos chew on blubber. there's your old persecution complex. whenever you're hurt, attack. well, that's what this is all about. [male newscaster chattering] (althea) i don't want you staying up too late, burton. you should've done that this afternoon. go to sleep, dear. maybe tomorrow morning i'll let you watch your father run out of the house. why can't he walk like everybody else? perhaps he's afraid somebody will catch him. kids at school laugh at him. they call me, "son of speedy." why does daddy race buses, mommy? nobody seems to know, dear. is it like some people save stamps? yes, exactly. some people save stamps, some make model airplanes, some drink, some smoke pot. well, your father races busses. if he smoked pot, he'd get there faster. good night, children. uh, our house is worth $37,000 on the open market. mmm, that's nice. that's 17 percent more than we paid for it. mmm, you need a haircut. oh. are we gonna get ready for bed early tonight? it's wednesday. wednesday? mmm-hmm it's monday. let's pretend it's wednesday. [sighing] forget it. i'm going to bed. you'll know where to find me. yes. [panting] how come you are not watching the riots? haven't started yet. what's the movie? i don't know. what's the commercial? i don't know. keep yourself pretty well-informed, don't you? i think we have to face up to something. oh, look. don't start. you can't stand the sight of me. i can so. you can't stand to touch me. wrong again. there's no passion in our life. there's plenty of passion in our life. [sighing] let's pretend it's wednesday. what? look, sweetie, i've had a hard day. i know you're tired, but... at least let me wake up on your side of the bed like we used to, thursday mornings. [sighing] as soon as janice was born, we stopped going to bed. now, that's an exaggeration. we can't afford more than 2 children. unless we have 6 at one time. that way, everything's free. and we can give them all away, except the spotted one. we can make love without having children, you know. there are methods, there are devices. they're not foolproof. they are if you use them all at the same time. i'm not making love to any heavy tank. i've still got some good years left, jeff. jesus. i take something, and i wear something, and i keep count, and if you... [snoring] jeff. jeff. [sighing] (man on t.v.) we were so right to come here, dearest. to get away. (woman) yes, ralph, i know. it's lovely. being with you, sylvia. being with you, ralph. (newscaster on t.v.) it marks the first time federalized troops have been used in this city. black leaders have warned that should such a situation... [screaming] how now, brown cow. [groaning] [panting] it's a nightmare. that's what it is, old buddy a nightmare. must be something you ate. that's right, something you ate. [laughing] put up your hands. give me your high school ring. a nightmare or too much sun lamp. boy, what a great sun lamp. [moaning] althea. i'm having a nightmare about my sun lamp. so don't wake up and try and talk me out of it. it's just a little nightmare about a great sun lamp. i'm going back to bed now. i know that when i wake up again in the morning, my skin will be lovely and white. so just stay asleep, althea. because as long as you're asleep, it's a nightmare. but if you wake up and begin screaming, it won't be a nightmare anymore. and i don't want that to happen. so just stay asleep, althea. as long as you're asleep, it's a nightmare. and all night long, it'll be a nightmare. it's a nightmare. it's a nightmare. it's not a nightmare. sure is an even tan. what a great sun lamp. [chuckling] what a great nightmare about a great sun lamp. that's an old wife's tale. [clattering] [shower running] daddy? mommy says i can watch you run out of the house today. dad, you in the shower? (jeff) yes. i'm having a nightmare. can we watch you run out of the house? uh, no, sweetheart, i--i--i won't be going to work today. i'm not feeling well. but mommy said. dad, the whole house is getting steamed up. so is your old man. listen, burton? yeah? uh, tell your mother to get you both off to school, and then come in here. you mean, you won't be racing the bus today? don't ever bring up the race issue again. [door closing] (jeff) oh, lord, i've never been a religious man. i won't try to kid you about that. i don't go to church, and i only pray when i'm feeling scared or rotten. i meant to pray last night. perhaps you're angry because i didn't. anyway, lord, i'm in trouble now. which is why i'm trying to make contact. please, lord, make it all be a terrific nightmare. and will you see a nice person come out of this shower? i want you to know that i am a true believer. there are no atheists in this shower. i'm praying now, lord. do you hear me? if you hear me, don't say or do anything. good. ok, lord. i'm coming out now. and i wouldn't care if i gained 20 pounds as long as i'm white. here i come, lord. [screaming] jeff, jeff, jeff there's a negro in your shower! (jeff) it is not a negro. (althea) yes, yes, yes, it is, it is. i saw him. call the police, he'll kill us. i am not a negro. i'm me. if this is another one of your jokes... now look, althea, i'm coming out of this shower again and i want no screaming, you hear? now, there's a logical answer to this, but we'll never find out if i dry up into a prune in this shower. now i'm coming out again, you hear? ok? yes. ok. (jeff) now, hand me a towel. all right. here i come, ready or not. open your eyes, althea, i need a friendly opinion. [hollering] did you have to give me a white towel? you simp. boy, you sure have a warped sense of humor, baby. oh, my god. oh, my good god. oh, shut up, there is no god. he don't give a damn. you--you look like a negro. i know what i look like. shut up. i mean a dark one. i mean, i mean, if i didn't know you-- will you shut up, althea? oh, oh, should i hide the money? oh, you are hilarious. [stammering] h-how do you know you're you? that's the dumbest thing you've ever said. of course i know it's me. i can tell from my bridge work. look. see? huh? huh? your teeth are very white. that's the contrast. and your hair. my hair's always been naturally curly. w-w-what about your birthmarks? i can't find them anymore. maybe i've been overdoing the sun lamp a bit. a bit! if you spent as much time in bed as you do under that sun lamp, maybe we would have more children. this is no time to discuss additional children. no, i'd say not. what would the neighbors think if we'd have colored kids running around! i am not colored! well, that's your story. when's the last time you looked in the mirror? i-it's the sun lamp, isn't it? because you wouldn't be teasing me like that if it wasn't the sun lamp, 'cause you're not a cruel person. don't you touch me. oh, boy. you're a treat. you're something to have around in an emergency. you know, you know, it's very strange. my mother always thought you were a little on the dark side. i mean, she never came right out and asked me. your mother is in no position to judge other people's races. the way her eyes slant up, my mother always thought she was chinese. silliest thing i ever heard. oh, yeah? well, then how come her feet are so small? and--and how come whenever you asked her when she was born, she always says "the year of the dragon"? and how come she was always so anxious to--to wash my shirts? does that sound like a white woman to you, huh? my mother has almond-shaped eyes. so has mao tse-tung. she eats too damn much rice. if you ask me, she's a member of the red guard. all right, jeff, all right. but it isn't a chinese issue we're discussing. we're discussing a negro issue. it's a sun lamp issue. well, that may very well be, but you-- you certainly can't go to the office like that. oh, my god, what time is it? gladys is in the office now. that's the first thing. i got to report in sick. you can't tell her that you woke up sunburned. sometime, althea, sometime. look, i won't be coming in today. well, i'm, uh, feeling a bit off color. [stuttering] anyway, uh, gladys, uh, look, just cancel all my appointments for the day, ok? tell 'em i'll call 'em tomorrow, ok? ok. thank you. the trick is to be logical and rational. i got a warrantee around her for that sun lamp. let's see, logical and rational, yeah. you really think it's the sun lamp, don't you? oh, you'd like me to be colored, wouldn't you? well, not really. but it would serve you right with that attitude of white supremacy. well, i didn't see you exactly runnin' over to hug and kiss me when you thought i was a negro. i was upset because i thought you were a stranger. oh, beans. if it was a white stranger coming out of that shower, you'd have humped him. ah, here it is. they're a reputable company. i'm sure this has happened before. yeah, all over africa. oh, just keep it up, baby. just keep it up. hello, i'd like to speak-- to--to speak to somebody with regard to your sun lamp model l.t.34x. oh, it's working, all right. a--a little bit too well. uh, uh, thank you. they're switching me to the manager. hello, my name is gerber. uh, i've got one of your model l.t.34x sun lamps. uh, serial number 36677231. uh, yeah. well, the problem is... that's an old wife's tale. excuse me. uh, the problem is, uh, it's made me rather dark. whew. well, a little darker than was necessary. uh, yes, once in the morning, and, uh, once at night. uh, yes, i--i--i use a lotion. uh, well, it's kind of my own concoction. uh, baby oil, cocoa butter, iodine, and soy sauce. [chuckles] about one third soy sauce. well, of course you never heard of it. it's my own formula. [laughing] l-look, you don't seem to understand. it's left me very tan. yes, very. dark. very dark. yes, very. you stupid! no, it's not a joke. i am not sir percival pulling your leg. 42, tangerine lane, and i'm a dissatisfied customer. hello? hello? hello? can you beat that? they want to send me a new sun lamp. that's very sporting of them. what the hell am i going to do with a new sun lamp? well, maybe you could mate them. you're just having a dandy time, boy. oh, relax, jeff. althea, you wouldn't hug me unless you really thought i was white, right? oh, poor baby, don't worry. you'll be white again. hey, wait a minute. what is it? there are things we can do. i mean, what do they do when they want to look white? th-they must use salves and creams. hair straighteners. i don't want my hair straightened, i want my skin straightened. what the hell else are we talkin' about? where are you going? to one of their drug stores. call me a cab. your cab's here. what are you doing? the door's not open on the cab. go on out there and open the door on the cab.

[chuckles] i sure hate to think every married couple has to get all shook up like this just to see how much they're in love. no riots yesterday. maybe that's a good omen.

(wainwright) show him in. no swelling. if it were overexposure, there'd be swelling. your lips, as i recall, were always rather full. high cheekbones, wide face. you tryin' to tell me somethin'? uh-huh. i don't see how it could be the sun lamp. anything unusual in your diet? crow. i've laid a lot of crow, doc. it could be some kind of an allergy. but it's more apt to be something else. well, go ahead, tell me. i won't blab. well, it's more apt to be something in your family lineage. you mean like insanity? it's quite possible that somewhere in your lineage, there is a negro strain. you're lookin' at a strained negro right now, doc. if that were the case, it would be apparent from birth, not in your middle years. and it would seem logical that your parents would have said something to you about it. they never called me a nigger. no matter how angry they got, they never called me a nigger. oh, they might have revealed it in other ways, ways more freudian. um, what's your full name, jeff? jefferson w. gerber. what's the "w" for? washington. jefferson washington gerber? do you realize that when the slaves were set free and they were allowed to pick any names they wanted, many of them chose the names of presidents? jefferson washington gerber! uh, what's your wife's name? althea jemima gerber. you're kidding me? what are your children's names? beulah and rastus. you're trying to prove that i'm a negro, and i'm trying to prove that i'm not! i'm only trying to compile some facts. all right, facts. what about my skin, huh, huh? what about that? that's a fact, isn't it? look, something happened to cause this phenomenon. somewhere there's a medical explanation to this, and we'll find it. when do you want to do that, doc? right now. how long do you think it'll take? maybe 3 hours. the rest is up to the laboratory technicians. hello, althea? guess who's coming to dinner? [sighing] the children are in bed. even burton. i thought it best. what's wrong? wrong? wrong? nothing-- nothing's wrong. how come you're on fire? [phone ringing] don't answer it. i beg your pardon? don't answer it. may i ask why? it's a wrong number. oh, then by all means, let's not answer it. but i feel i should ask you this, althea, uh, how do you know it's a wrong number? it has a different sound. wrong numbers sound neurotic, because the circuits are confused. i see. and it just upsets it if you answer it. uh-huh, strange, but it sounds like a right number to me. no, you're wrong. you're nuts! hello? (man) jeff gerber? yes? move out, nigger. it was the wrong number. they've been calling all day. what "they"? it was one voice. don't make it sound like the entire west point glee club. well, who do you think it is? it's avon calling and the bell's stuck. jeff, i have to tell you, i'm frightened! you don't have to tell me. it's fairly noticeable. how did it go today? oh, it was the usual day. i was thrown out of one of the better clubs, i was picked up twice for purse-snatching. what? nothing. did they notice anything, anything different at the office? there were a few remarks. what about townsend? oh, he seemed quite pleased. it seems i'm one of his hottest negro salesmen. you hungry? yeah, i guess so. what? are you crazy? is that supposed to be funny? i didn't realize until after-- well, listen, jemima, you're in this, too. jemima? your middle name, baby. my middle name is janine. oh. so don't you "jemima" me, jeff gerber. if you've been keeping some racial secret about yourself from me, well, just don't you "jemima" me! oh, i get it! you're getting a little worried. you're just not certain about things anymore, are you? well, there are children to consider. [ringing] what do you think, right number or wrong? i don't care anymore. it's been ringing all day. every bigot in this town is honing in on us. hello? (wainwright) jeff? it's dr. wainwright. yes. what is it? it's not hay fever. oh, good. thought i'd let you know. yes. thank you. let me know as soon as you find out about ragweed. i'll call immediately. dr. wainwright. you'll be happy to know i'm not suffering from hay fever. i'm a nervous wreck. i'm going to bed. oh, i thought we'd stay up a while and do a little humming. i'm going to sleep. you can turn off the phone if you like. can't. might be my ragweed calling in. suit yourself. don't be frightened. it's just me, black bart. have something to eat? just chicken. watermelon doesn't taste good to me unless it's freshly stolen. mind if i get in bed? (tom harkness on t.v.) this is tom harkness in the downtown business area, where police are just now bringing under control a riot. althea? within minutes the area was overrun with pickets, militants, and housewives for lower food prices when an unidentified drunken negro was denied admission to the hagstrom yacht club. though the actual identity of the man is not known for certain... if only they wouldn't be so pushy. [phone rings] hello? (man) jeff gerber? yes. move out, nigger. was it dr. wainwright? i certainly hope not. althea, it's wednesday night. why don't we have a little drink? wednesday? no, it's thursday. let's pretend it's wednesday. i'm in need of some human affection. i understand, but not tonight, ok? i hate to tell you this, but i'm beginning to feel just a little bit unloved. i mean, it may be old-fashioned, but where i come from, a guy's wife sticks real close to him in time of stress. well, uh, not tonight. something i said? we could change sides if you'd like. that's damn white of you. [phone rings] hello? (wainwright) jeff, it's not ragweed, asthma, or anything to do with the kidneys. good, keep me posted. i'm staying with it all night. thanks, doctor , i appreciate it. [phone rings] hello? (man) jeff gerber? he's out bailing cotton. can i take a message? move out, nigger. jeff, don't anger them. just don't anger them. don't anger them? you mean, they're not angry already? what must i do to get 'em angry? try and get into one of their yacht clubs? good morning, mr. gerber. morning, erica. when do i get to see your switchblade? call me. morning, gladys. mr. townsend's waiting to see you. he's fit to be tied and... dr. wainwright called twice and wants you to call as soon as you come in. thank you, gladys. (wainwright) jeff, it's no longer a joke. it has nothing to do with allergies, blood counts or electrocardiograms. and it has nothing to do with soy sauce. we've run 18 different tes on soy sauce, and the opinion is that soy sauce is more apt to make you oriental than negro. c'est le guerre. (jeff) that's logical. i spent the entire night in the trenches with doctors carson, harcourt, whittemore, o'neil, and hamilton. and they're firmly of the opinion that... jeff, i'm not one of those doctors who believes in keeping the truth from a patient. did you know that the first man to die in an american war was a black man, crispus attucks? what i'm getting at is, jeff, you're a negro. when do you want to see me again? i don't think it's necessary. closing the book on me, huh? now, with your approval, i'd like to turn your case over to an outstanding young doctor who's a member of your own race. dr. john l. catlin, you may have heard of him. what's the "l" for? lincoln? you do understand, don't you, jeff? of course. good. well, perhaps we'll bump into each other again some day. maybe at the newport regatta. mr. townsend is waiting. you disappeared on me yesterday, gerber. (jeff) i'm sorry. i thought it was important. it wasn't. look, i want a negro representative. but i will not tolerate any lack of diligence. i understand. good. now, i want you to turn over all your files to brandon. he'll service them. you can still get the commissions. this is the area i want you to work in. the sooner you get started, the better. any questions, come directly to me. oh, uh, by the way, gerber, i notified the n.a.a.c.p. and core that we have a negro on our staff. they're both quite pleased. don't let 'em down. these policies aren't quite correct for a man in your bracket. i'd recommend that you set aside a bit more for your future children's education. i'm very happy to say that for the first time today, i'm gonna recommend that somebody buy an insurance policy from me. i strongly suggest that you, uh, invest some of your widow's pension in income-earnin g stocks and bonds. and i'd be glad to recommend a man. he's white. many people are. well, gerber, it looks to me as though you've been giving out quite a bit of free advice these past few days. (jeff) that's part of the job, isn't it? maybe, but on your first day you made 9 calls and sold one policy. 3 policies you did nothing about, and 5 policies you re-arranged so that-- so that our company loses $363 in annual premiums. but eventually, all those people will become good customers only because i took the time-- oh, nonsense. gerber, those people don't know the first thing about insurance. you would be doing the community a public service to sell them all the insurance you could so that they would never become a drain on our society. every one of those homes i visited in the last few days was occupied by personable, responsible-- horse crap! look... ? excuse me, buddy, but ? ? excuse me, lady, but ? ? you foolin', ain't ya? ? ? where can i be? ? ? this ain't america, is it? ? ? oh, lord, where can i be? ? ? this ain't america, is it? ? ? no, this ain't america ? ? you can't fool me ? (catlin) you're wrong to go on trying to fool yourself. ? this here's the home of the sheriff ? ? not the land of the free ? ? in america, folks don't run through the streets ? ? blood streaming ? ? from where they been beat ? ? and the parks is for the people ? quite a background. dean's list 3 times, college graduate, excellent service record. 17 years in the insurance profession. ? and the cops in the good old u.s.a. ? ? don't they need some kind of gods either? ? ? no, this ain't america ? ? you can't fool me ?? [tractor engine running] you're not kidding, man. take jamie over there, he's got 13 years. and a hell of a good bowler, too. of course they always make him bowl on the far lane. kind of downwind, so to speak. [chuckling] i'm not kidding. ? love ? ? that's america ? ? open arms for every creature ? ? love ? ? open arms ? ? that's america ? ? for every man ? ? love ? ? that's america ? ? joy and peace and harmony ? ? love! ? ? that's america ? ? billions of lives ? ? love! ? ? love ? ? that's america ? ? yes, love, that's america ? ? love! ? ? that's america ? ? lonely but fallin' ? ? love! ? ? that's america ? ? the old eagle wearin' a grin ? ? love! ? ? that's america ? ? the bald eagle ?? jeff, you know our neighbors. well, the vigilantes. i've got the coffee on. (jeff) well, then, what can i do for you gentlemen? jeff, we may as well get right to the point. everybody else does. we feel your presence in the neighborhood can undermine the value of our homes, and we're concerned. (jeff) yes, i've gotten a couple of your phone calls. oh, that wasn't us, jeff. shut up, fred. as nicely as we can put it, jeff, we'd like you to move out, before it becomes common knowledge that there's a negro family in the area. is that as nicely as you can put it? we're concerned. oh, perfectly understandable. especially since i've taken the spot announcements on radio. and wait until you see the skywriting. we're prepared to offer a very fair deal. walter has the figures. walter? your house is worth about $40,000 on the open market. $37,000. well, give or take-- $12 as soon as the word gets out that i'm a nigger. we represent a group of people, jeff. and we have the backing of 3 local banks. so we're prepared to offer you $50,000. oh, i do declare that sure am a great pile of money. we'll sell your house to a good family and absorb the loss among ourselves. [chuckles] oh, my goodness! 50,000 samoleans! heavens to uncle remus. but i can't accept it. we're prepared to pay it right now. tonight. oh, i know you're prepared to pay it. but i'm not prepared to accept it. i mean, uh, me and my family, we've looked forward to living here all our lives. we like it here. all those friendly phone calls, and at any time a nice rock can come crashing through the window to remind us that people are still thinking of us. $60,000. that's as high as we can go. oh, come on, try harder! $75,000. all right, $75,000, but that's as-- you see that? you went higher. now try $80,000. $75,000. oh, come on, i'll make more than that from my watermelon patch in just one year. not to mention the admission from the revival meeting. $80,000. [chuckling] now try $90,000. unless of course you don't mind the smell of fried chicken and ham bones just wafting through your lovely neighborhood. $90,000. oh, that sure am a lot of money. but i like something with a--a more, uh, naughts to it. you know, somethin' a bit rounder, somethin' with more naught you know, zeroes. $100,000. and that's as high as we're authorized to go. you turn it down, we're not responsible. well, i'll take it. i'll take it. where do i sign? you'll find everything in order. as you know, walter's an officer with the bank. it's all pretty standard, if you care to read it over. i think this is the best thing for everybody all around. oh, i think so, too. i was going to sell this house. i think the neighborhood's a bit too jewish. well, good night, jeff. good luck. it's nothing personal. oh, it never is. if it was personal, well, i'd feel real bad. good night, jeff. you have 2 weeks. look, if you have any trouble, and need to store your stuff, please call my secretary. she'll give you the necessary assistance. good night, jeff. you've gotten a very good deal. perhaps--perhaps it'll make us seem less villainous in your eyes. good night, jeff. villainous? don't be silly. i know who my friends are. and the next nice neighborhood i move into, you guys'll get first crack at me. [laughing] $100,000! all i got to do is turn white. boy, would their faces be red. you took advantage of them because you're colored. how's that? those people were our friends. what should have i done, given them a discount? pushing your way, just pushing, pushing, pushing. is that the answer? they wanted us out of the neighborhood. where do you get that "us"? you, not us! would you repeat that again? i don't think i heard that right. it's very confusing. forgive me. there's been a great deal of pressure on me lately. i mean, just answering the phone... well, i haven't been exactly winning any popularity contests myself! well, it's different with you. you weren't liked before this happened. i was liked! everybody liked me. everybody. i hate to tell you this, but you're supposed to be on my side! the marriage contract said, "till death do us part." it said that in black and white, i believe. when we got married, i had no idea it was going to be an interracial thing, you never told me. well, i just got wind of it myself. if i had known what was gonna happen, i would have put an escape clause in your marriage contract! "if my husband becomes a negro, all bets are off." how dare you be sarcastic with me? i'm the one who was compromised. oh, i'm not angry. how could i be angry? i have a $100,000 suntan! and why do you insist on being negro? i don't insist. i accept it. what would you have me do, dye my hair and insist i'm white? you know what i'd look like with blonde hair, althea? like a grilled cheese sandwich. negro humor always escaped me. well, we're learning a lot about each other, aren't we? yes, we are. what happened to the flaming liberal i married? i'm still liberal. but to a point. i'm sorry, baby. [sighing] i didn't realize you were under as much pressure as me. let's forget it tonight. because tonight, it's wednesday. it's wednesday. and i love you. no, it's tuesday. it's wednesday. i'm sorry, jeff. i have to get my bearings. it won't be wednesday until--until i get my bearings. i-i-i'm going to go to sleep. ok. jeff, i sent the kids to my sister's. your sister lives in indianapolis. they'll be there by morning. margaret said she'd meet the train. i'm sorry, but i wanted them away from all this, if and when the newspapers find out. ? where are the children? ? ? where are the children? ??
