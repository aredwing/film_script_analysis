The Manbreno wants peace. Let the war between our people be at an end. I speak for my people and my government. When I say that the rights of the Manbreno shall have the respect and the protection... Dirty murderer! Stop that man. Who is he? I've never seen him before, captain. It looked like he's out of his mind, sir. Plump out of his mind. What a time he picked. How is he? He's dead, never knew what hit him. - Lieutenant Wilson. - Yes, Sir. - Who's riding to Fort Apache? - Cassidy, sir. Now this almost the end of December. That makes a supply-column leaving from Fort Apache to be here any time now. Twenty men and a load of ammunition will never get passed Mangas. It can make things pretty warm here with all that powder. The Manbrenos aren't a very big tribe, captain. Yeah, I know. But that ammunition could change things. Anyway, I'm taking no chances. I'm asking for two full companies, to reinforce the post. Cassidy, I appear for the Fort's ordinance, sir. Escort this to General Crook personally, Cassidy, you understand? Yes, sir. I'd ride now, sir. Right, and step on it. Cassidy, keep your eyes open. I'm practically on my way back, sir. In case I don't get back in time, a Happy New Year to you, captain. - Same to you, Lieutenant. - Thanks. Merry Christmas to you. Thanks, Sam. As long as I'm not at this Christmas dinner, tell the cook to split up my portion and go for the men. All right, get out of here. - Merry Christmas. - Merry Christmas. My father wanted peace. I want Fort Yuma! Don't you know if you don't let loose of me? You'll throw away the chance of peace treaty. Don't you know that? Don't you know that you will have all the U.S. Army if you do this? That's U.S. government business... You'll have to answer General Crook for this. What are you gonna do? You'll have trouble for this. You're breaking the treaty. Don't do that. You can't get away with this, they will hang you. Everyone of you. - Is it good. - That ought to do it. Be sure to check it over carefully. It's gonna be heavy loaded. Alec. You want me, Lieutenant? We're leaving for Fort Yuma first thing in the morning. - Lights out in one hour. - Yes, sir. Excuse me, sir. About my termination for training. I got tactics and communication memorized, sir. How about it? Can you read it to me? - I know it by heart, sir. - Can you read it? No, sir. Can you write it? No, sir, but I know... When you can I'll forward your application. I never heard of an officer in the U.S. cavalry who couldn't read or write. Yes, sir. I told you it wouldn't work, Milo. I guess they just wouldn't cut out brass, that's all. Oh, is that so? You got too much studying to do than to waste time and feel sorry for yourself. Come on. I'm not feeling sorry for myself! And I asked you a million times, not to call me Milo! Okay, Mike, okay. Hello, Ben. Lieutenant Keegan. What are you doing here? I'm going to Fort Yuma with you. How did you get your orders? General Crook. I wouldn't count on it. You better get back on your own outfit. Merry Christmas, Lieutenant. Thank you, sir. The same to you. You'd like some punch? No. Thank you, sir. Now, what's on your mind? I've been assigned to take the supply column to Fort Yuma. Yes, yes, according to the duty list it's your turn. That's right, sir. Well, what's the trouble? No trouble sir, I'm requesting another scout. Why? I'd rather have not an Indian with my company, sir. We've known Jonas for years. He rode with the outfit for a long time. Now since when has he ceased to be a friend and become just another Indian? There is nothing personal in this request, sir. Of course not. That is your business, I suppose. There's no other scout available. Then I'll go without one. You'll be blessed well with any scout I see fit to sent with you! You run your company, Lieutenant. Leave the rest of the army to me! Yes, sir. Now wait a minute! I haven't dismissed you yet. Now look, Lieutenant... You've been out in this territory for a long time. No one knows any better than you how tough it is to straighten out this mess with the Apaches, and put an end to these raidings and killings. You've been with me from the very beginning. You've known them all. Geronimo, Nana, Victoria, Cochise, the whole lot. There's more to this, Lieutenant, then just turn to see how much Apaches we can shoot. We're supposed to make them believe in us. We're supposed to convince the Indians that we want to live in peace with them. I know that is not easy to do when we're shooting them down. But we are just about to got it linked. Mangas Colorados got his Manbrenos on to Fort Yuma right now. And they're just about ready to sign. That means it's over. It's up for a few renegades. That's the easy part, we can smoke them out. Then there doesn't have to be another shot fired in this territory. Do you know what that means? That means the settlers can come and work the mines, without worrying about their families winding up on some Apaches' poles. This country can live in peace again. There is one thing I've learned out here, sir, and that's never to trust an Apache. Well, I never have and I never will, treaty or no treaty. You got a good record, Lieutenant, militarily speaking. You're a good soldier, fought well, but there's another side to you, I have never known a man who hated Indians any harder than you do. You're the only officer on the post, that never took a prisoner. You've got more Apaches killed than the whole company of men. - Where is Jonas? - I sent him back to his own unit. What? What?! You counter ended an order of mine!? If you ever dare to do that again, I will court-martial you. Now find Jonas. Bring him here. Yes, sir. Come in... Both of you. Shut the door. You know each other, you soldiered together. Two men from entirely different worlds. Yet both Americans. For 15 years I've been trying to bring peace between the peoples of your two worlds. In the final analysis, I guess it depends on the individual. Now you two will go to Fort Yuma! And if there's any trouble, I'll hang you both. Come in... I didn't mean to intrude you, Gen. Crook. I just wanted to say good night. You haven't Miss Crown, just some army business, it's over and done with. Oh, this is Lieutenant Ben Keegan. Miss Melanie Crown. - How do you do, Lieutenant. - How do you do? Lieutenant Keegan will command the column to Fort Yuma. - I see. - Miss Crown will travel with you she' going to the fort to establish a school for the children. Miss Crown is a missionary. My pleasure, Sister. Thank you, brother. - I haven't met this gentleman. - Forgive me, this is Sergeant Jonas Arabia, Lieutenant Keegan's scout. I'm pleased to know you. Gracias. Well, I will not interrupt you any longer Gen. Crook. Thank you for the lovely party. - Good night. - Good night. Good night. Well, I still have guests. Remember what I told you, both. I've been waiting for you. What are you doing here? Did anyone see you come in? No one. You should know better than to come here. - You're leaving tomorrow. - That's right. How do you know? Jonas told me. He says he's going with you. Yeah, he's going with me. Your brother is very fond of me. Didn't you notice he never let me out of his sight for very long. He always likes to be around, just in case. In case of what? Oh, in case my horse stumbles and I break my neck. In case a rattler gets a lucky bite. Even a sunstroke would satisfy him. Why should he want that? What do you think? Jonas can not change what I feel for you. That's is what goes against his sensitive Apache soul. Or maybe it's just as long as I'm leaving. I'm going with you. What did you say? I shall be with you. - I travel with Miss Crown to Fort Yuma. - Are you crazy? Jonas is going with me. - You got to stay here. - I can not stay without you. - You gonna have to. - I can not. I love you. Forget it, I said, you can't go. - And you love me. - For the love of heaven, you shut up. You're afraid. Get out. You know, she ain't bad for a priest. She isn't, she is no priest, she is a missionary. Like a teacher. - Yeah? Maybe she could teach me. - What? Well you know, reading and writing and things... What sort of things? Oh, you know... Only how can you go thinking things like that? That's sacrilegious. - Hallock! - Yes, sir. - Check the ammunition wagon is riding firm. - Yes, sir. Are you riding comfortably, sister Crown? Very comfortably, thank you. Oh, and Lieutenant, I'm sure you're most generous and respectful... I bare no title. I'm a very ordinary woman. My mistake, ma'am. If I can be of any assistance, I'll be riding just ahead. You're very kind. I'll try make things not too difficult for you. That's a comforting thought, ma'am. I'll bare that in mind. I have a feeling that Lieutenant Keegan finds himself to be quite irresistible. In these parts some women find it herself. - Everything is riding easy and gentle, sir. - Thank you, Hallock. - What are you read, Sergeant? - Oh,I'm just passing time. A few passages out of the Scripture. Well now, that sounds interesting. How about reading out loud? Oh, I'd do that, certainly. This is from the fifth Psalm. But not all put their trust in new rejoice, let them ever shout for joy, because thou defended them. Let them also glorify my name and rejoice in me. Very good, Sergeant, very good. Would you mind reading some more? Oh, all right. But out Lord will bless the righteous and comforted them in sheer. Very good. Excellent, Sergeant. - Very well read Hallock. - Oh, thank you, lieutenant, I didn't know you're listening. These psalms are my favorite. - How about some more? - More? Yes, I'm particularly fond of the next one. The next one... oh, oh, sure... Have mercy... upon me, oh Lord for, for I am... weak. O Lord, heal me... for my bones are... Oh Lord... Come on. - Hallock. - Yes, sir. - This is it for today, prepare out camp. - Yes, sir. Dismount! Those are the most beautiful colors I have ever seen. It's hard to imagine such dry and desolate country looking like this. I wish you'd could see where I come from, I think you'd like it. There are four changes of seasons and the colors are different for every change. It's beautiful all the time. This is my home. To me it is beautiful here. Of course it is. I only meant.. it's lovely at this time of day. It's just not what I'm used to seeing. Where I live, everything is very white now. Covered with snow. To you, snow is beauty. To me it only means sickness and death. Would you do something for me? What would you have me do? I'd like you to have this. Why? I'd like you to have it. I have others. We are very different, Miss Crown. Everything about us is different. I do not need those to remind me. Thank you. Sergeant. Would you mind? Thank you. Sergeant. I'm afraid I'm not much good at pitching a tent. I'm sorry to be so helpless. You're very kind. Thank you. Your sister seem most anxious to make the trip with me. I was hoping we could be friends. But I'm afraid I'm not having much success... with either of you. I'm sorry. She admired my mirror. I offered it to her as a gift, I think she resented that. My sister is proud. But it's a genuine pride. I respect her for it. If I've done anything to offend her, I'll apologize. Why is it important that my sister be your friend? We're two human beings. That should be importance enough. And my work is very important to me. I want to... to know your people. The way they live, the way they think, the customs. Before you learn our customs, miss, I suggest you become familiar with some of your own. Ms. Crown, I don't know anything about the missionary business, but if you're interested in Indians, I suggest that you start small, like with the kids at Fort Yuma. Dismount. # Silent night, holy night... In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth. And the earth was... without form and... rawhide. And darkness was... upon the face of the deep... And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters. - How's that? - Huh? - Oh, you weren't eve listening. - I was listening, Milo. - Mike! - I'm sorry, Mike. - Did I make any mistakes? - Only on... rawhide. That's what it said. I know, but it's "void". At this way I'd be retired before I make Lieutenant. - Is making Lieutenant really that important to you? - Uh-huh. Why? - Why? - Yeah, why? You're Sergeant Major, you'll retire with good pay... Look... You see these? I got them when I enlisted eighteen years ago. It isn't that everyone can wear them. When you wear these you're more than an officer. You're a General. I don't think there was ever a Hallock a real gentleman. And that's what I'm gonna be. General Milo Hallock... the first. What's so funny? You called yourself Milo. Well, that's for when I'm a gentleman. - Until then, you call me Mike. - Okay, Mike. - Good night. - Good night, kid. Void... uh... void. I couldn't sleep. It's so quiet. I'm used to hearing a little noise, now and then. I hope I'm not disturbing you. You should not be here. Why shouldn't I? It would be better if you were not. But you haven't told me why. That should be obvious. You know, I'm very new here. I'm not sure I know which one of us is supposed to be objectionable. - You're very kind. - I'm not being kind. Only honest. I can not say that I am popular here. You should be more careful in your choice of companions. - I don't understand. - I am an Apache, Miss Crown. This uniform doesn't change that. You just have to look a little more closely. And if I did? What would I see? What they all see - a primitive savage. Possibly a little more civilized than the rest, but one to be watched, closely... Very closely. There an amusing little cavalry jingle. It says something about the only good Apache, being a dead Apache. Or perhaps a pretty one. Your resentment is every bit as strong as theirs. It that your professional opinion? I'm sorry. - I didn't mean it to sound it like a sermon. - Why not? Isn't that what you're here for? To preach to the savages. Please. I'm sorry. Miss Crown... - Yes. - Forgive me. Please. Sometimes it is very difficult for me to forget I fight my own kind. I've always believed my people to be wrong. We should live in peace. But they're still my people. For me now, there is no home. No place. Can you understand? I do understand. Thank you. Good night. Halt! How far do you think it is to the next watering hole? It depends on which fork of the trail you take. Which one would you take? The one on the left, away from the mountains. We'll take the one to the right. - There could be Indians there. - There could be water there too. - Hallock. - Yes, sir. - I want two men from the fence detail. - Yes, sir. Up farther the trail, divides two forks. One goes to the right along the mountains, the other one cuts out through the desert. You take the one to the right, along the mountain side. Up there somewhere is a waterhole. You wait there for us unless it's dry. If it's dry, ride back and then you'll cut across the desert trail. Forward! Column, halt. - What do you make of it? - I can't say. "Though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil, for thou art with me. Thy rod and thy staff, they comfort me. Thou preparest a table before me in the eyes my enemies. " Thou... "Thou mazes my head with oil, my cup is runneth over. Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life. In I shall dwell in the house of the Lord, forever." Amen. - In the evening and the morning with the Third... - Two of them were buried down there. How are they supposed to know it was poisoned? - What was? - The waterhole. Well, if they didn't drink it before we got there, maybe all of us would be dead now. True. - Francesca. - Yes. I'd like to speak with you. I know what you have to say, I would rather not listen. Francesca. You are my sister, my concern is for you. I'm not a child. You're a woman and should have a women's dignity. Dignity. Dignity is for women like the missionary. Dignity is the right of every human being. What have I done that's so wrong? Ben Keegan, that's what is wrong. - Why is that so wrong? - You're a fool. You're not of his world. And with a man of my own world, would I have this dignity, of what you speak? No. I'd be little more than cattle. When I walk with this man of my own world, would I walk closer to his side? You know, I would not. I'd stay out of distance, forever in the shadows, paces behind. Is that dignity? With Ben Keegan, you can not walk at all. - He cares nothing for you. - How can you say that? - You do not know. - I know him. There is no love or respect in his heart for people of his own blood. I watched him, fought with him. He is a cruel man. He kills with a savage pleasure, 'cause there's nothing but hatred in his heart. An Indian is an animal to him. You are an Indian. And he uses you. Like an animal. You are hidden from everyone's eyes because of the shame he would feel if anyone knew. - It is not true. - It is true. Because you are my sister, I also feel your shame. And what of your shame? Do you not wear military cloths and kill your own kind. Is the dignity of a women less important than the honor of a man? There was no other choice for me. - There was no other way. - Nor for me. Two words can make a little difference to either of us. I love you. I love you. - Hallock. - Yes, sir. - What the devil is that? - I don't know, sir. It seems to come from the river. - Go have a look. - Yes, sir. Put out that fire. - You are all right? - Yes, but our scout is out there. - Apaches! - Take him alive. Where does he belong? Mescaleros, maybe. What's your tribe? - Who are your people? - Lieutenant Keegan. Lieutenant Keegan. Truman and Sand are dead, sir. They were stripped... naked. Here's your poisoned waterhole. Now find out what his tribe is. Ask him, what they want with army uniforms. All right, tell him this... He either tells me what I wanna know, or I'll roast his brain over that fire. Burn him. - No, I talk! - Hold it! - I am Mambreno. - Mambreno? - Mangas Colorado's bunch. - Mangas Colorado is dead. His son Mangas is chief now. So, the young ones got the holds on their hands. Maybe that explains a few things. What does he want with army uniforms? Now listen to me, animal... You and your red brothers killed four of my men. So when I talk to you, you better answer or I'll tear your insides and feed them to the wolves. Now where is Mangas and what does he want with army uniforms? You will not reach Fort Yuma alive. - Hallock. - Yes, sir. Hang him and get the column ready to move out right away. Lieutenant Keegan. That boy is a helpless prisoner. You can't just hang him like that. - Who says I can't? - It's inhumane. Inhuman? He killed four of my man, and almost cut your throat. I don't think he's alone, there are plenty more of him out there where he came from. And if one of them ever gets a hold of you, you'll learn what the word "inhuman" means. So if you're in a praying mood, I suggest you say a few for all of us. We Will need them. God have mercy on his soul. - Milo. - Mike. - Do you think they'll catch up with us? - They might. Do you think there are many of them? Oh, I don't know. You don't worry about a little shooting, are you? No. I was just thinking about what might happen if they got their hands on us. Forget it. Lieutenant! They've stolen a wagon. Let them keep it. Full gallop! Where is Taylor? Taylor! Taylor! - You want to get your head blown off? - I can't find Taylor. We haven't got the time looking for anybody, now anybody has to take care of himself. Lieutenant, Lieutenant, look! Milo! Taylor! - Where do you think you're going? - Taylor, I gotto take care. - Stay put right here. - Please, sir, I got to get to Ken. If you go up there you'll wind up next to him. Is that what you want? - I want Taylor. - Hallock! Milo! Milo, don't let them touch me. Hallock. Hallock! Yes, sir. The rest of you man, give me a count! Give me a count! Give me a count! Give me a count! Give me a count! Don't let him, Milo! Go away from him! Hallock! Hallock! Hallock, answer me, you thick-headed idiot! If he keeps yelling like that, they will find him. Francesca. Ben, no. Francesca. Ben. I... I love you. Francesca. Francesca. They moving on to the fort wearing our uniforms. If they get inside the walls, the closed ones won't stand a chance. This isn't my fight anymore. Let them burn it to the ground. - Jonas. - I don't fight my people anymore. - Not for men like him. - No, Jonas. Not for men like him, but for the Hallocks, the Taylors, and the men at the waterholes. Do you know why they died? Because there was a barrier. An invisible wall between the white men and the Indian. Jonas, this was Francesca's fight. It is our fight. Or is there still a wall between us? Try to find some loose horses. And bring them back here. Look, it doesn't make any difference now. She's dead and I can't bring her back. Things could have been different. I could've made them different. That's something you won't have to remember. Do what you like about me later. Right now, let's find some horses. Sergeant of the Guard. Column approaching. - Column is approaching fort, sir. - It must be the troops from Fort Apache. - Open the gate. - Yes, sir. Open the gate. - The gates of the ford are open. - We make a passing now. It would be better if you remained here. They are the Apaches, sir, dressed like troopers. Close the gates! Open the gates, open them! Honey. I can think of a lot of things, I'd like to say to you now. I'll take your regards to the general. He likes to be right, you know. When he tried to bring the two worlds together. It is the individuals that count. See you next trip. - Goodbye, Lieutenant. - Goodbye, Ben.
