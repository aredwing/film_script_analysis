Ajju... It was his plan. We all have to go to hell one day. Do this job and you'll go in a... ...big car else you'll have to go walking. You can keep your big car. I prefer walking. It's better than going on four shoulders. Hey stutterer, try to understand. Bali... Sports an earring, abusive in nature and pea-brained. You're trying to make me understand? Do you think this is some cooperative bank in Kolhapur? You will walk in and point a gun at the guard, and he will intimate the... ...cashier, who in turn, will gift-wrap all the money and give it to you... ...saying, Happy birthday, sir! This is America, ass! Within two minutes, you'll be brought back here... ...and you'll be celebrating your birthday here. Bali had uttered words of wisdom for the... ...first and the last time in his life. - Trying to make me understand! Major. Only Major or his past knew why everyone called him... ...Major. But our present was dearer to us. Major said... - Ajju is right. - Hell! We'll have to come back here... ...whether we take the right or the left. Hey chicken! You're right. - Yes, I'm right. I'll send for you when I've to burgle a poultry farm. Chicken stealer! - Hey don't call me chicken... - I won't call you that. I understood. - Yes. Hey! What do you say? And this is me, I'm always thinking. But now, I feel why I didn't think about it at that time. I'll think about it and let you know. What'll be my share? Andy, he had done his masters in software development. His consent was necessary for the development of this plan. As much as you can handle. - But how much? The question isn't: How much liqueur is there in the bar? The question is: How much can you drink? And what about the cop? Mark, he was a bouncer in a club. From there he bounced here... ...directly, amidst us. He'll come in our way only when he comes to know about our plan. And by the time he comes to know about it... You would've opened a dance bar in Mumbai along with your... ...girl. And we six would come there to see your girl dance. Hey Ajju! Enough! Don't say anything else about her. Hey Mark! I'm scared! See, my hands are shivering. What if the police comes? - They won't. What if they do? - Then we'll send them back. Can't we do anything else? Something which is less risky? Fortune wants to warm your bed for you... ...and you want to sleep on the couch! Fortune is that whore who doesn't sleep with me. Understood? Fortune! If any one of us tries to make our fortune... ...then these people won't let us. If someone is killed somewhere, then... ...these people nab us. If there's a theft anywhere, then our houses are searched first. The Italians have their mafia. The Colombians have their cantles. The Chinese have their triunes. And all these are so organized that no policeman... ...can ever dare to knock at their doors. And we... we Indians, what do we have? Nothing. Nothing but police records. If even a blind man sees something at a distance... ...of 400mts, he says, "That must be an Indian. And these people nab us and bring us here. At a distance of 400mts, even an elephant looks like a hammer. We are made to wear the turban of crime... ...and we'll be made to wear it as long as... ...we don't have money to buy innocence. Major was a good speaker. Had he spoken on screen... ...then he would've received an Oscar. He spoke here and received a bullet. Major made all of us think. - Think about it. We still have time. - And a plan as well. Alright! You're free for now. If the bell tolls in any one of your heads... ...then come to club Niagara tonight. I'll wait for you there. We... we'll wait for you there. Had I not been there, then you would've gone out hungry. You got up from the bed again! Sometimes I feel that you like me to scold you. Is there anything that I don't like in you? Yes. Why did you leave the bed? C'mon! C'mon! Yes, give me that. Give me that plate. You stayed awake all night again, isn't it? - Yes. I had to prepare the project report. But now, it's enough. I've stayed awake many a nights. Now I believe those people will like my work. We'll get money and then we can go back to our country. Maybe the doctors there... - Can perform that miracle... ...which none of the Americans doctors could. I know that I don't have enough time to listen to your scolding. The only gratifying thought is that I'll be able to close my... ...eyes for the last time in the land... ...where I had opened them first. You shouldn't say such things. Nothing will happen. Please! I'm very old in this business. I can pay back. Please! What's this? What'll I do with this, buffalo? You calf of an elephant! Bull! Will I clean myself with this? What'll I do? - Now what's this guy saying? I'm saying, Milord, this isn't enough. I want more. I have got more customers. More... I don't trust your ass, man. - Please! Please! You bearded dog, please give me. You know how much this is worth, brother. I know, I'll give you three times... four times more. Please! Please, baldy! Hey buffalo! You rhino, tell this buffalo to remove this. It scares the hell out of me. Tell him! You don't pay that back, man, you're dead! Dead as a duck! Don, t worry, idiot! Nine out of ten times, Bali's blabbering got us into some... ...mess or the other but we were lucky this time. How did I fool that fatso? - You're such an idiot. You abuse him like anything. Buffalo... Goat... - But he doesn't understand. What if he does? - If he had understood then we would've... ...been dead meat by now. Hey police! Police! Run! Run! Open that window! Open that window! Throw it, dog! Game's over, guys! - I've thrown it! I've thrown it! Cut the shit! Where's the truck? - What truck? Is this about a truck? - Is there something else you want to... ...talk to me about? - No! No! - Shut the hell up! Where's my truck? - Your truck partner is there, there and there. Let's get these guys out. Lose your crazy heart to me... Lose your crazy heart to me... When has the heart followed our orders? There's always chaos in this heart... He'll steal my gaze, he'll lock me in his heart... ...will this ever happen? No... no... Lose your crazy heart to me... Lose your crazy heart to me... These rosy cheeks of mine are trying to trap you... The trap of these golden hair... ...the eyes that are watching you. How'll you escape and save yourself? This won't happen... ...No... no... Lose your crazy heart to me... Lose your crazy heart to me... Stop! Stop! Stop! You created trouble again! You're fired! Because I take my job very seriously, is it? Not seriously, because you take your job very personally. That guinea bastard was touching her. Stop! Stop! I need this bastard as well as many such bastards. Otherwise will I drink all the whisky in this club myself? I need customers! Stop! Stop! Do you know the job of a bouncer? He's supposed to keep the customers away from the girls. Not break their bones. Do you understand that? You're fired! Shut up, Cyrus! - You're fired! Throw him out! - Fuck you, Cyrus! It's alright! It's ok! It's alright! This is the best club. C'mon, guys! Have a great time! Three hours ago, a truck full of lockup disappeared from... ...highway thirteen. We have a feeling you could tell us about it. What are you talking about? I've been working here for the past six hours, damn it. Ask him. - Why are you lying? He's lying. He wasn't here. He's lying. He wasn't here. Goodbye! Goodbye! Excuse me! I'm here to see Mr. Adler. I'm afraid he hasn't come in yet. I'm here to see Mr. Rubric. - Mr. Rubric, you've a visitor. Down the hall. Ma'am! - Sir, I'm sorry Mr. Adler is in a meeting. Perhaps you would like to try again next week. O Mr. Adler! Sir, I won't take much of your time. I won, t beat around the bush. We can't do business with you. Your background is so... Look, Mr. Adler, I'll explain to you. The board won't listen to me. I really cannot convince them. I'm very sorry. - Sir! Excuse me! Mr. Adler! Sir! Mr. Adler, see. I've given up all those things. I've started life anew. In the past ten months of my new... ...life I've developed this new business plan. I can bet on anything that your board won't ignore this... ...business plan. According to this plan, listen to me... ...7% of the market, packaged Indian food, will be in your... ...pocket in the first quarter. I have the capability to work hard. I've courage... the nerve... I just need your support and faith. Ok, your idea is interesting. Why don't you meet me... ...at my office tomorrow morning at 9am. Ok. I'll... - Time to go, Major. Let's go. Is anything wrong, officer? - When was it ever right? Let's go, Major. - But... Hey! McGuire wants to see you. - Why me? You can ask him yourself at the station. Let's go. Hey you, Blondie. You're next. As far as me and Bali were concerned... ...all our stories had three facets to it. One was mine, the other his and the third was the truth! Hey guys! Did Bali tell you how we came here? For the sake of Biryani. He came home early morning... ...saying that his uncle was making Biryani at his place. Forget home-made Biryani, his uncle fed us burgers instead. That too from MacDonald's. As soon as we came out, we met McGuire and we are here now. Are you getting bored? After that... You, sir, let it be. Are you going to tell me where the truck is? What truck are you talking about, man? - The truck you stole. Stole!? Do I look like a thief to you? Yes, you do. - Tell him! I had been there to meet Rosy. She stays on the twelfth floor. Rosy! Tell him. You tell him. I went to meet Rosy. Big boobs Rosy. My girlfriend. Big boobs Rosy. What was I going to do taking the truck to the twelfth floor? How do I take the truck to the twelfth floor? You tell me. Major! Tell me about the truck? What the hell are you guys talking about? What did I do? I was just doing my work quietly. That's what, Major. You are always doing your job quietly. But we aren't going to sit here quietly. Major, this time we're going to make sure that you've a very... ...long appointment with the law. Yeah, right. - You bet. Major, why do I feel that you've a secret to share? Would you like to listen? - Sure. Why not? By calling me here, you people have committed a grave mistake. Really? - A very grave mistake. Now apologize for your mistake and tell me... When do I get to go? When we find the truck. - And when will you find it? When you tell us about it. You are asking the wrong person. Really? Then who's the right guy? When love transcends all limits... When life becomes restless... Don't love so much that lust goes into your mind... The ocean of love! The ocean of love! Give me my companion, I'll pray a million times for you. Give me my companion, I'll pray a million times for you. Without seeing my beloved... I'm not able to understand anything... My eyes will tell you all about love. The ocean of love is within my heart. Give me my companion, I'll pray a million times for you. Without seeing my beloved... I'm not able to understand anything... No one is unfaithful... is bad at heart... By luck, crazy lovers don't always have bad times. The heart is torn to shreds when the dagger of time is pierced. The ocean of love is within my heart. Give me my companion, I'll pray a million times for you. You also fall in love with the unfaithful. You also fall in love with the unfaithful. Whoever maybe your companion, but you do have one. The ocean of love. I've to love you... I've to wait for you. I've to love you... I've to wait for you. Living for me, is to die in your love. Till when will you be on the run, making me wait for you? The ocean of love is within my heart. Give me my companion, I'll pray a million times for you. Without seeing my beloved... I'm not able to understand anything... The ocean of love is within my heart. The ocean of love is within my heart. Where were you at 6am? Hey asshole, I asked you a question! No English. Tell him that I don't know English. He doesn't know the language, sir. Then you tell him what I ask him. - Oh I will. Where were you at 6am? - Where were you at 6am? I was with his wife. - What is he saying? He said he was in a bar, sir. Well, what was he doing? - What were you doing? I was banging. - He was drinking, sir. With whom? - With whom? - His wife. - Friends. Where's the truck? - Where's the truck? I forgot it outside his house. Sir, obviously this man doesn't know anything about any truck. Does he want us to get nasty? - Hey hero, don't take uncle Sam... ...to be your uncle. Answer fast. He's getting angry. Tell him to get angry at his wife, she also put in the same effort. Look sir, this man obviously doesn't know about anything. Well then who does? - Then who knows? - His wife knows. Your wife. - What? - No. My mistake. He said, 'his man,. His man. - How does he know? - And how does he know? Because he was banging her too. Give me a moment, will you, sir? Look, foreigner! Don't act like the mafia, wearing a trench coat. This is regarding my job. Answer the questions. What the hell are you talking about? - He's just wasting our time. He's bull-shitting us. He's playing with us. They kept asking all night and Ajju kept answering... ...that he was with that cop's wife. After sometime, even that officer started believing that... ...Ajju truly was with McGuires wife. Did you listen? Hey asshole! Uncle Sam has laid his eyes on you. Tell him not to look at me too much. It'll do me bad. Asshole! Truck. - Lawyer. What lawyer? - What truck? Where's the truck? - Where's my lawyer? Do these people think of us as talcum powder? Even if they itch a little, they pick us up. Not talcum powder, but condoms. They use us all night... ...and flush us down the toilet in the morning. Hey Ajju! Shall we talk business? - Yes, boss. Anyway, they pick us up every third day. It isn't good for my reputation. Which station? - Reputation. - What? Reputation means status. You won't understand its English. Ok. Status, that too yours? Hey donkey, what do... ...you do when you're outside the jail? The same thing that you do with McGuires wife. This McGuires wife is quite popular. How many of you have an affair with her? Mark? Andy? - No. My standard is a bit high. Good. Let's get down to business. Major, I had heard that you had given up everything. Boss, Major had promised his wife that he's given up everything. Just like our hero. Hey! Even you've promised your girl that... ...you've given up everything, isn't it? What? What have you promised your girl? That I'll kill you. - Then kill him first. I can't give up my business for a girl. Stupidity! Stupidity! Business!? Have you seen his girl? - Is she beautiful? Beautiful? She's the queen of Club India. You're talking of business? I can leave this world for her sake. I'll help you leave this world. - Leave him. Hey guys! - Major! Major, just ignore them. They're just whiling away their time. You were saying something. McGuire is whiling away his time with us. But you people won't understand that. You keep wasting your time over unnecessary talks. You won't think why the police is always arresting us. The police commits the crime of arresting us. Hence, the police will pay the price for doing so. How? - By looting their banks. - The service American bank? Every cop here has an account there. That's why no one has dared to loot that bank till date. Because the one who loots this bank will be taken on a... ...procession to the graveyard by the entire police dept. Then why do you think, smarty, that the same won't happen to you? Because brother Bali, the security in that bank is so weak that... ...even your mother will be able to loot that bank. Till now, they received their salaries from that bank... ...now we'll receive ours from there. We've received it. We all have to go to hell one day. Do this job and you'll go in a... ...big car else you'll have to go walking. You can keep your big car. I prefer walking. It's better than going on four shoulders. Hey stutterer, try to understand. You're trying to make me understand? Do you think this is some cooperative bank in Kolhapur? You will walk in and point a gun at the guard, and he will intimate the... ...cashier, who in turn, will gift-wrap all the money and give it to you... ...saying, Happy birthday, sir! This is America, ass! Within two minutes, you'll be brought back here... ...and you'll be celebrating your birthday here. Ajju is right. - Hell! We'll have to come back here... ...whether we take the right or the left. Hey chicken! You're right. - Yes, I'm right. I'll send for you when I've to burgle a poultry farm. Chicken stealer! - Hey don't call me chicken... - I won't call you that. I understood. - Yes. We've to make them talk, sir. What do we do with them? Let them go. I'll get those damn Indians. Alright! You're free for now. We all started going our own ways... ...when Satan called out to us for the last time. If the bell tolls in any one of your heads... ...then come to club Niagara tonight. I'll wait for you there. We... we'll wait for you there. Mark, why are you always fighting? I can't stay calm if anyone touches you. This can't go on, it's got to stop. - I know! Ok. Listen. We'll meet Cyrus, we'll talk and we'll work it out. But you've to promise me that you won't lose your temper. I won't. Ok? Come. You've come back again? Can't you understand simple words? ...anymore problems here because of me. There'll be problems only when you don't go from here. Ok. C'mon! - Go, Lisa. Go! If one girl goes, a hundred will come. This is America, baby! Go with this good-for-nothing. Go! Go! Go! C'mon, Lisa. C'mon! - Where, Mark? Lisa! - No! Look, Mark. I love you. But even I've very few options. I don't like doing all this. But what do I do? You know this is L.A. And it's very difficult for a girl to stay alone in this city. Very difficult! - But, Lisa, you're not alone. I'm with you. Where are you, Mark? You spend half of your time in jail. I want to come with you. But when you have your own house. I'll surely have my own house, Lisa. But there won't be any place for you in that house. But you know that your mom doesn't like dogs. What shit! How many times have I told you not to use such language? I'm sorry, dad but this is not fair. C'mon, let's go home. Could we spend some more time, dad? Please? Listen. You know that when I take you home late... ...your mom gets angry. She'll scowl at you. Fights with me. Yeah. - And what when she comes home late? She works. - No! She goes out with uncle. Which uncle? - The uncle who comes home. The one who bought me these shoes. Since when is he coming home? - Since a long time. C'mon. Let's go home. What time is it? If you can't bring him home in time... ...then why do you take him out? - Renu! Don't 'Renu' me! It's enough, Andy. If you're going to act so irresponsibly then I feel... ...you should stop meeting him. Renu, I'm his father. - Oh really? Then bear the... ...expenses of his education, his dresses. You call yourself his father? Then where were you when... ...he was ill and I had to call the doctor at midnight? And then where were you when he was beaten up by... ...his schoolmates and had come home crying? You were in jail, Andy. You were in jail and we got punished. It wasn't my fault. It was a mistake. Yes. It's never your fault, Andy. When was it your fault? It's my entire fault. It's my fault that I married a man like you. You're a loser, Andy. - Shut up! Don't shout! This is my house. And I know what happens in this house. Aren't you ashamed! You come to meet your son so... ...that you can ask him about my personal life? Well, how sick can you get? - Renu, it's nothing like that. I haven't asked him anything about you. I don't care, Andy. And one more thing... ...don't try to rule over me because only a husband... ...has the right to do so, and you lost that right a long time ago. Renu! Why don't we start living together again? I'll work things out. Why? What'll you do? Will you rob a bank? I don't understand all your plans. What I understand is this! Beauty! Look! Look! - You can't understand anything, man. Look, ripe mangoes. Hello beautiful! How are you? Hey he's a guy! - Oh a guy! Not my kind. What a fool! - Look, here's a girl. Until I lighten up, my brain doesn't work. And moreover, my hands have been aching for the past 10 days. What is your name? - Sugar! - Sugar! C'mon, pal! You are possessed just about one thing. I agree but my father had told me not to be possessed at anytime. When I was small, my father told... You fool! When your dad makes your strip and kicks... ...you on your ass, then you'll understand. Which dad? The one in the morning, the one in the... ...afternoon, the one in the evening or the one at night? Even my mom doesn't know who my actual father is. Not even my mother, you know... You know which dad I'm talking about. The one whose powder you threw in the L.A. atmosphere. I'll think of some plan to pay him back. Hey pal! We should find some solution to this problem. Then what do you think? Does those people's idea to loot... ...a bank, provide a solution? I'll think of something. You don't worry. You'll think? - Look, if you feel that what those four fools... ...think is right, then you're a bigger fool than them. Man, their money... - Don't eat my brains, man! If you can arrange for the money somehow... ...then do it. Do it however you want. Let me think about my little brother. Listening to all these boring talks of yours... ...I feel that it must have gone slept off standing. - Ok! Ok! Think, what if they loot the bank? Then it's their good fortune. - Not their good fortune, but ours. How's that? - Look, if the plan fails, then we all will escape. There's just a distance of four bullets... ...between us and millions of dollars After this, the money that was supposed to be split into six... ...will be split into two. One yours, and the other mine. Mine will be split among these people. C'mon, man! - C'mon, Bali! - No! No! I'll be back after... ...killing four others. - What? - No, you won't understand. I'm coming. - Coming? - I'm coming. Don't worry. Let's go! Did they like your job very much? - Yes. This time I've found the right people. Now there's nothing more to fear. I have full faith in you. You can never do anything wrong. But what if it's too late? - I won't let it be late. It's my promise. So you all are ready. - Yes, alright. The plan is... - Just a minute, Major. What's this? - I knew that this rascal had stolen the truck... ...and we all got screwed. That's why I'm splitting the money among all of us. All of you keep the money on the table. Why? - Because in order to loot a bank... ...we need guns, cars, cameras explosives... ...and for all that we need money. What if I hadn't been a gentleman, Major? Then we would've stolen something else. We can steal something else even now. Let's keep the money with us for the time being. No, Bali. Major is right. When there's a feast, why should we beg? Andy! This money is enough for me. C'mon, it's good. The money that was to be split into six... ...will now be split into five. - No! Even now, the money... ...will be split into six. - Why? Will you give me an extra share, Major? Not at all. Every gadgetry in the bank is computerized. The cameras, vaults, everything. It has a security code. And we need a software engineer... ...to break that code. Why do we need an engineer, Major? This Tarzan is with us. He'll break the code. We've to break the bank's vault, Bali. Not the bank manager's neck. Why are you unnecessarily trying... ...to make him understand, Major? He doesn't know the difference between software and underwear. What do we do now, Major? - We've got to get Andy. This is not enough. - I love my son, isn't that enough? No. - Meaning? Look, Andy. This money is enough to fight the case. But not enough to win it. To win the case, the judge will... ...ask whether your son has a bright future with you. Whether your son will get new clothes, toys to play with... ...will he see a college from inside. The answer to all these questions is money, Andy. A lot of money. I'm sorry, Andy. Lifting up their collars... ...puffing on a cigarette. Lifting up their collars... ...puffing on a cigarette. What's there to worry about? Whatever has to happen will happen. They've started, blowing off their worries in a cloud of smoke. Don't know what'll happen, Oh God! Don't know what'll happen, Oh God! They want dollars, they want pounds, they want to hear... ...the sound of gold coins. This guy is a fool, he doesn't know anything. He just wants money. What's there to worry about? Whatever has to happen will happen. They've started, blowing off their worries in a cloud of smoke. Don't know what'll happen, Oh God! Don't know what'll happen, Oh God! Don't know what'll happen, Oh God! Don't know what'll happen, Oh God! If the police comes then it'll come from here, or here. Meaning, here, here and here. I want all of you to check... ...every nook and corner of every street. Do not leave even a corner, not even a single inch. Otherwise we won't know from which way death will come for us. They left behind all their friends and relatives. They broke all the laws of society. For the sake of unknown paths... ...they turned their backs to life. What's there to worry about? Whatever has to happen will happen. They've started, blowing off their worries in a cloud of smoke. Don't know what'll happen, Oh God! Don't know what'll happen, Oh God! Don't know what'll happen, Oh God! Don't know what'll happen, Oh God! But we've to keep the people in the bank under control. We've to keep them under control. Neither do I want any bloodshed there... ...nor any innocent deaths. There aren't answers to all questions. Then why are there questions? Major, make him understand. Why should Major make me understand? - Shall I continue? I swear on Allah! No one throughout America... ...can give you more stuff than me. Mark, shall we take everything? - Why? Are you going to fight a war? You can even fight a war with all these, dear. I swear on Allah! Half of Kashmir resounds with... ...the sound of my bombs. Hasn't anyone caught you till date? How will anyone catch me? I'm a very smart man. I've very highly placed contacts. So you've very highly placed contacts eh? - Yes, why? You think that you're very smart eh? I don't think so, I'm very smart. Then rat, hasn't anyone told you not to talk of destroying... ...India when amidst Indians? Dear one! Whatever an Indian might be... ...he never likes two things. One is, losing in cricket... ...and secondly, attacking our country. They're so determined that the earth is... ...above them and the sky below them. The burden of the earth fell on the earth and died. What's there to worry about? Whatever has to happen will happen. They've started, blowing off their worries in a cloud of smoke. Don't know what'll happen, Oh God! Andy and Mark had always done bad things living in their country... ...maybe for that moment, the burden on... ...their souls had lessened a bit. We'll reach there in three different cars. Mark and Ajju will be in the first car. And Mac and Bali will be in the second. And I and Andy will be in the third. By the time Andy and I reach, Ajju and Mark would've done their job. First car, second car, third car... is someone sponsoring the cars? Yes. You're responsible for that. Here, take. Hey donkey! This money hasn't been loaned from your chicks. Bali, use this money like your brains... - No way!... with care. Hey! I'm tired of eating this. Why don't you order rice and pulses? Hey! Shut up! Major, will we scare the guards by showing our fingers? No. with guns. You, Mark and Andy will... ...collect the guns, today evening. Hey! Shoot with one eye shut. - Bali's bullets find their targets... ...by themselves, brother. If you keep aiming like this then you'll become a target one day. It's easy to shoot words, Major. Do you know to shoot? Do you? It's loaded. After that, no one dared to speak against Major. Eh Bali! Come here. - What? Tell me one thing, if I keep this bomb on your head... ...then what will rip open first? This bomb or your head? The bomb will rip open first. No. Actually the head can also rip open. No, pal. This is a really confusing question. You tell me. Your ass will rip open first. Ajju! - What's this? - Bomb. I activated it. - What? Keep sitting. Keep sitting. Keep sitting? Hey! Will this erupt? You fool! It's a bomb and it's beeping, so it's bound to erupt. Why, man? - You're scared shit! You're scared! Hey Mark! Are you standing there waiting for this bomb... ...to erupt!? Deactivate it! Deactivate it! It's can't be deactivated. - What do you mean? Meaning? You forgot Hindi along with English? Is this bomb enough to kill this scoundrel... ...or do I keep another? - No! It's not needed. He'll die such a death that he won't take birth again. Then here, smoke your last cigarette? Tell me something, Mark. - Yes. - When the bomb erupts... Yes. - Will his hands tear off from... ...the elbow or from the shoulder? He'll die! - He'll die!? - Yes. If I die, then I'll take everyone else along with me. Then who'll fulfill your rites? My father? Do you have any one of your own? You beggar! Why fear when I'm here? I fear because the bomb is here. Hey Mark! From today, I'll address your girl as my sister. You'll do so, right? - Yes. - You'll do so? - Yes. Then throw it. Throw it else it'll burst. Why? - Throw it else it'll burst. Hey throw it! It'll burst! - Hey Bali! Throw it! - Hey! Hey! Hey Andy! Take it! Look what happened there! Look what happened there! You call this a bomb? There's gas coming out of it. Why? Are you regretting about being alive? Moreover, it made a chicken out of you. Didn't it? - Yes, it did. So, this is our plan incase the police comes there tomorrow. Why are you talking about the police all the time? You're scaring me. Why don't you say... ...at least once that the police won't come? If... Bali, if... - This 'If' is a very dangerous word. If this happens, then this will happen. If this doesn't happen, then that won't happen. If my aunt grows moustaches then I'll call her uncle. This is very bad. Hey Bali! Hey Bali! Why do you get tensed? What are you talking about tension? It scares the shit out of me. You're talking of tension. Hey! Who knows about tomorrow? Here, take. Have a cigarette. C'mon! What'll I do about this? Ajju's bomb helped us forget everything for a few moments... ...and gave us an opportunity to laugh. How could we know that death was... ...secretly laughing at us as well. We all will go in 2/2 formation. Mac and Bali first... ...and then me and Andy. Ajju and Mark will be present... ...there already. Once we're in, we're all strangers. No one will talk to the other. As soon as we go in, me and Andy will go to the manager's... ...cabin. I'll handle the manager and Andy, you'll manage the... ...security cameras. We'll have only five minutes for you. Ok? All four of you will be in your positions. Near the alarms. As soon as I come out wearing a mask you all will wear yours. And move the security guards away from the alarm first. ...then we sink along with our plan. Get it? We had everything with us. Plan, money and courage. If we didn't have anything, then it was just mutual trust. Because we all had taken birth learning one thing from our... ...mother's womb: Never trust anyone! Not even your mother! Which junkyard have you brought us to, Major? Ok everybody, cell phones. - Why? Neither will anyone use their phones now... ...nor will anyone move out of this place. And we'll loot the bank tomorrow. But the plan to loot the bank is for the day after tomorrow. We'll loot it tomorrow. Any problems? Very smart, Major. I understood. If we loot the bank tomorrow instead of the day after... ...then none of us will be able to make our own plans. I'm with you. Me, too. I don't keep one. Ok, one final time. We'll discuss the plan again. How many times do we discuss the plan, Major? If we discuss it once again, then we'll forget everything. Then what'll we do till tomorrow morning? What'll we do? We'll drink and make merry! I'll arrange for a couple of babes. Hey! Keep it. - No? - No. Hey listen! The plan. The plan is a watch. Swiss watch. The parts of the watch, that's us. If we're perfect... ...then the watch is also perfect. Tick-tock! Tick-tock! Otherwise, it'll turn into... ...a bomb and we'll go... boom... understood? Yes, so what was I saying? The plan. Once more, the plan. I'm sick, I'm tired. Whatever you've said... ...has stuck to my brains, brother. Leave it! Leave it! Leave it! Leave it! Leave it! Leave it! Leave it! Leave it! Leave it! Don't split my brains! Hey brother! Big daddy, don't twist my brains. Leave it! Leave it! Leave it! Don't split my brains! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! There's a bank, within the bank, there's a safe... ...in the safe, there's booty and on the booty are our eyes. Bank... boom... safe... boom... booty... boom... We're rich now, we don't have any worries. You'll forget getting panicky, tomorrow, we'll have so much money. Leave it! Leave it! Leave it! Planning has become too boring. Open the bottle and pour the liqueur. Understood? Leave it! Leave it! Leave it! Don't split my brains! Hey brother! Big daddy, don't twist my brains. Leave it! Leave it! Leave it! Don't split my brains! Hey brother, we're tired so we're sitting... Aren't you tired of sitting? C'mon! C'mon! Talk! Money! Money! Money did something amazing... ...it trapped my heart in a net. What's love... romance... - boom... - booty... - boom... ...it threw me empty-handed out of life. Leave love's collar, brother. Let's count dollars, brother. Forget the game of love... Leave it! Leave it! Leave it! Leave it! Leave it! Leave it! Don't split my brains! Look, our poet woke up. I left everything... I left everything... I broke the heart that gave me love. I left my own... my dreams... I broke my relation with joy. I left everything... This world is crafty... anything can happen here. This world is crafty... anything can happen here. Give up receiving... giving... crying... loving... Leave it! Leave it! Leave it! Leave it! Leave it! Leave it! Don't split my brains! Hey brother! Big daddy, don't twist my brains. Leave it! Leave it! Leave it! Don't split my brains! Excuse me, gentlemen. Is this some kind of a joke? No. Actually it's a robbery. Forget it. If we're successful today, then at the most, you'll lose your... ...job. if we're unsuccessful, then... ...at the least, you'll lose your life. So you do your work quietly and let us do ours. Got it? I'll translate real fast. If we pull this one off... if we pull this one off... ...at worst, you lose your job. If we don't, at the best, you'll be shot. So why don't you shut your mouth... ...and continue doing your work and allow us to do ours. Excuse me. Everybody down! Down! Down! Down! Down! Down! What babe? What are you doing tonight? We can enjoy all night, I'll have enough ...money after looting this bank. Hey! Put up your hands! Put up your hands! Out! C'mon! Steady! Easy! Kill me. - This bullet will kill you before that. Now don't shout anymore. Ok? Half of your life will perish shouting! If you've the strength to shout then have the strength to bear the pain. It'll burn a little. Ok? If you had listened to me earlier... ...then you wouldn't have had to scream now. I won't scream! I won't scream! Just relax. Major! Major, I'm feeling very scared. It's ok, you should feel scared. You've been brave all day, today. It doesn't matter if you feel afraid now. I'll take you to the hospital as soon as these people show up. Promise me. Promise me, Major. - Yes. I promise. What if I die before they show up? We'll bury you somewhere. Hey! Nothing will happen to you, understood? We've been trapped. Hey! He's dead! I'm still alive. Don't worry. You'll surely die. Shut up! Just shut up! Nothing will happen to you. Nothing! Is it paining a lot? No. It's tickling me and I'm laughing. It'll hurt you more if you laugh, jackass! Lie there quietly, you'll live. Where are the rest? - I don't know. How did you come here? - By car. What car? - The lady didn't tell me her name. Which lady? - Someone over there, but she isn't there any longer. One among us is a traitor. - What? One of us is an informer for the police. You think one of us is a police informer? Don't you think so, oldie? Hey! Mind your tongue. Else you won't leave this place. I'm not bothered! Even then I'll speak. Someone has vomited everything to the police. And if you don't feel so then... ...you've lost your mind and he, his life. Shut up! Shut up! You had said that there won't be much security there. Yes, I had said that there wasn't much security there. Because there shouldn't have been much security there. Then how did my in-laws reach that place with my wedding procession? It's possible that someone might have tipped off the police... ...so that they could escape with the money at the last moment. Yes, that's possible. Where's the bag? - Huh? Bag... where's your bag? That... it's there somewhere. - Where? Somewhere there... - Where there? Why should I tell you? Let everyone come then I'll tell. Where's the bag! Have you said anything? - No. How did you escape from there? - How did you? I asked you first. I hit three out-laws, one in-law... ...and escaped with his car. I hope you don't feel that all this... ...is my doing? - It's possible. It's possible in your case as well. It's possible. - It's possible. Why isn't it possible? He has died. - He's unconscious. No, he isn't moving. He's dead. He's unconscious. Let's go there and talk. Why did I feel that he has died? Tell me something, Major. If the police can come there, then it can come here as well. So? - So what? Let the both of us leave. And what about him? What about him? - He's injured. We're not going to leave him like that. We'll kill him. What are you looking at, Major? He's of no use. He's a burden on the earth. He's your friend. There aren't any friends in business, only partners. He was the one who taught me that. From the first day, till today. Every story is about his share. Hey! Stop! Hurry up! Let's leave! Who are you? - I'm a cop. And who's that? - Thief. What's in your hand? How much do you have? Ten. - Five each. - Seven mine and three yours. Five each. - Ok, truce. Six mine and four yours. C'mon, man! No. Five each. - Ok done. Let's leave! Run! He's a rogue! A rogue! Had I been in his place today, then he would've said the same thing. You both would've killed me and left. He got shot, his fate. We weren't, our luck. Shut up! Just shut up! Anyway, that dog is going to die in an hour. Why don't we kill him and escape from here? - Shut up! Shut up! Ok. If you don't want to come... ...then don't. I'm leaving. Hey Bali! Bali! You've gotten into my nerves! Since when have I been tolerating your nonsense! You're sick! You're sick! I won't be able to tolerate your nonsense any longer... ...do you understand that? Understand? Now before I shoot your brains off your skull... ...tell me where's the bag. Where's the bag? Great, Major! Blow his brains off! Even I want to see whether he's got grass stuffed inside or hay. You're alive. I thought you were dead. Were you thinking so... or wanting so, Major? What do you mean? - Nothing. Nothing. It would've been good had anyone shot you. You shoot me, that's why the police spared me. For you. Where are Andy and Mark? I don't know. You're acting as if nothing has happened. What has happened? - He thinks there's an informer amidst us. What do you think, Major? - It's possible. I don't think so. I know. What else do you know? What do you mean by that? There's someone amidst us who's an informer. You're the one. - What? You're the informer. - Hey! Don't talk nonsense. I'm not talking nonsense. You informed the police, isn't it? I've evidence to prove it. - Hey smarty! Don't act smart or else... - Or else what? I'll shoot you, mad guy! Yes, I'm slowly going mad. Shoot me! - Look Ajju, I'll shoot you. Shoot me! - I'll shoot you! Hey Ajju, I'll shoot you. Hey Bali, your gun is as empty as your head. Where are the bullets? - It was there... I swear it was there. It was there... where's it? It's here. This is loaded. What are you doing? - I've found out everything. You've been seen with a policeman many times. Who's seen me? - A man. He's coming. Your man is talking nonsense. Since when are you fooling us? Speak up! How do I fool you? You're already one. You planned all this with a policeman, isn't it? You can think what you want. But move this pistol. Ok. Listen... Move it! You'll fire a shot by mistake. Hey! Move it! Hey! Move it! Move it! Chicken! He's such a chicken! What you said there... what's it about? I was just kidding, Major. There should be some fun, isn't it? That guy has been shot, and he's lying there. There's no sign of Andy and Mark. The police can come in anytime. And you feel like having fun? Ok, Major. I'm sorry. I was just... I was just what? I was just what? All of you are crazy! Don't know what I've gotten myself into! Hey Major... - Hey! Move your hand! Now don't get so annoyed... - What don't get annoyed? You're getting too angry, Major. I was just kidding. Even I was kidding. Hey don't touch me! If you're done with your love scene, then shall I say something? Yes. Tell me. What do you want to blabber about? Yes. I'll blabber. From now, I'm going to blabber. We're standing like this over here. What if the police come? Let them come. We'll see. You see them. See them through binoculars. I'm going. - Where are you going? Somewhere where I can stay alive. At least one of us has to stay alive to attend your burial. Asking where, huh! Bye! Hey! What are you doing? Have you gone mad? You're not going anywhere. Tell me something, who are you to stop me everyday? Your father. Because right now, he's the one who has a loaded gun. So? So? So you're such a chicken... such a chicken... ...that a few bullets fired here and there made you wet your pants eh? Hey chicken! Hey chicken, speak up! Yes, I'm a chicken! I'm a chicken! You're a beggar! A beggar! You don't have anyone of your own. I've a twenty year old sister. A twenty year old sister, understood? Shall I marry her? Will you marry her? Do you have the guts to do so? She's mentally retarded since birth. I'll be your slave all life if you marry her. Will you marry her? I've taken care of her... ...since childhood. Will you take care of her? I'm a chicken! So what? What's wrong in that? You're scared to death now, aren't you? Aren't you scared now? You were making a big plan! We'll earn a lot of money! Earn a lot of money, eh? Because of you we all are in a mess now. Because of you, understood? He's right. - Major, you too? Hadn't you shot that fellow then we wouldn't have gotten into trouble. I can't understand you people. - Why? Didn't you shoot that man? He was trying to press the alarm, Major. All the alarms were deactivated. All the alarms were deactivated. I had forgotten that! I explained to him a thousand times not to move. I even pressed a gun to his temple. Even then he moved, so I shot him. It was a matter of my honor. What else could I've done? Then you did the right thing. Even I don't compromise when it comes to my honor. Hey! What are you saying? Even you killed four people there. What else could I have done? I had to protect myself. Even you should've practiced your firing on 2-3 people. It was such a fine opportunity, so many constables together. Do you think that I'm a donkey like you? Because of your foolishness I'm trapped here today. He... he... he got shot instead of me. That bullet was meant for me, I was saved because he came in between. If not, then I would've died today. Fools! If I had known that you all are such big... Then I wouldn't have taken up this job I would never have taken up this job. Hey Major! - What is it? Are you going to bark all day or are you going to bite as well? Hey! What did you say? What did you say? Are you going to bark all day or are you going to bite as well? You want me to bite you eh? Leave him, Major. I'll pump so many bullets into you that the next time... ...you press the trigger, the bullet will come from some place else. Why do you mess with this pimp? Hey you whore! Whom are you calling a pimp? Why? Hasn't anyone called you by your real name before? Yes. I'm a pimp. Your girl's pimp. What'll you do? If anyone of you lifts your hands again, then I'll shoot you. Did you enjoy? - Yes, I did. Hey Mark! Leave it. He's crazy. Major, are you taking sides with him. - To hell with you all! I played along with you all thinking that the job will be done easily... ...I'll get some money... - And then you and your girl will... Shut up! Shut up! First tell me, how did the police come there? - They flew in. They were called. - By whom? That's what I'm saying. There's a traitor amidst us. You. - Why? Can't it be you? How did he come here? - I brought him. Why? - Because he'll tell us who's the traitor. Since when is he here? - Since I put him here. Why did you need to put up such an act? You should've brought him directly. Major, it's exciting if there's a twist in the story. He's asked us a lot of questions. Now it's our turn. It'll be fun. It'll be fun. I don't like this. He's a policeman. - I like it. Because he's a policeman. Mr. McNairy. Why do I feel that you're going to share a secret with me? I told you that you had committed a grave mistake by nabbing us. Major, don't scare him too much. He'll die. Do you know English? First class. I've spoken English since childhood. He speaks since childhood, but no one understands. But he'll understand. Ask him how the police reached there. Tell... - Not you. You'll take a lot of time. You ask him. How were the cops there? How were the cops there? Why isn't he speaking? He must have ulcers in his mouth. Ask him now. How did you know that we're going to be there? What did you say? I asked him that how did he know that we were going to loot a bank. You didn't use the word 'bank' at all. - I meant... You just say whatever I can understand. He's saying the same thing. - Major, when did he speak about the bank? No he didn't. - He didn't? Ajju, tell me something. Be honest about it. Who gave you the passport to come here? His mother. She was working in the passport office since childhood. You ask him! You ask him! Answer me. - What did you say now? Answer me. - Answer me! Give! Give, it's English. Give. Give! Even I'll do it. C'mon! Give! Give! Speak or they'll kill you. What did you say? What's he grumbling about! Ask him! Don't get into my nerves. Tell someone else to ask. He'll answer only if you ask, understood? You guys are all dead. All dead. What did he say? - Nothing. - He said something. He said that we are all dead... ...meaning we are all dead... All in Hindi means... ...everyone... I don't find anyone dead? Who's dead? He says that all of us are going to die. Who'll kill us? Who!? Who? Who!? These guys are maniacs, they'll kill you. Tell us who's the hack amongst us? What are you going on about for so long? Let him ask what he's asking. If you want to understand then learn the alphabets first. I want to know, Major. I want to know what plans they're cooking up in English. Look! You're an illiterate fellow, not the rest of us. We can understand what he's saying. Ok! I had forgotten that you all are educated. Andy, ask him! If you want to save your life, tell them what you know. One of you... One of you is an undercover cop. What happened? Why are you looking at each others faces? What happened? What did he say? Major, what did he say? Tell me! Tell me, what did he say? That one among us... ...is a policeman. What the hell! Is it a heartbeat or the report of a gun? What'll bring us close to death? C'mon take control of your life... Who knows when we'll meet fortune? I don't have peace, comfort or tolerance. This question keeps haunting me. Don't know when death will come. Whom it'll come for and whom it'll take away. Death! It's necessary for life. Death! What kind of a dark compulsion is this? Death! We stop when it comes. It takes us away in its arms. Special task operation. You've to be undercover. Live with them for a while. Like one of them. Follow them. Get their deals, get their contacts and keep informing us. You've got to get them. The Indians shouldn't shit here. We knew about everything. The guns, the cars, everything. Tell us who that guy is. I'll count till three. One... two... three. Shut up! Drawing a gun for everything! Why, Major? Is it you? Yes, it could be me. What'll you do? You'll shoot me? C'mon shoot! Shoot! No. It can't be you. Why? Why can't it be you? This rascal will tell me! No, Ajju! Have you gone mad? Will you kill him? Will you kill him? He's a policeman! If you kill him then the entire... ...police dept. will dig you out and screw you. We're already screwed. This dog has already seen us. What difference does that make? Our job was to rob the bank, split the booty and keep going. That's all! The booty's here. And so are we. Pick up your share and keep moving. We don't need to even see each other's face again. No need to see each other's face again. Pick up your booty and leave. And forget that pimp... ...who screwed us. No! None of us will leave this place until I shoot him. Ajju is right. I'm in dire need to leave this place. Unless we find that scoundrel, none of us will leave this place. I'm with Ajju. And so am I. Major? - Even me. Ask me as well. Conduct meetings, conduct conferences. We've been conducting conferences since we met. Sit down. C'mon! Sit down. - Andy! Cut it out! I'll tell you what to do. We all should collect the money and... ...accumulate it here. And then nab that bastard! Where's the money? - It's there. Outside. In the car. I left it on the way. - Where's yours? - It's here. I'll bring it. No! Not alone, Mark. Ajju will come along. Why? Don't you trust me? What do we know, pal? You can be a cop, I can be one. He can be one. So, two will go together. I'll go along with you, Major. - Ok. C'mon. What about me? - Will your father come to keep an eye on him? What about me, huh! Hero, what do you think? Who's that scoundrel? Look, I don't want to discuss anything about this. Let's go. C'mon! Tell me. - I told you I don't want to discuss anything about this. Ok, forget it. Tell me, how's you girl? Ajju, don't even talk about her. Anyway, there's nothing between us any longer. Nothing!? This is good news. - Why? I had my eyes on your girl for a long time. She dances so well, man! When she dances, then even Babura dances. C'mon! Hit me! What are you laughing for? Hit me! C'mon! There isn't anything between us. If you love her so much then why don't agree to it. Look! The job's done. We have the money as well. Now, you go and take her out of there and take her to India. And then a dance bar... don't open... don't open... I'm telling you. Go get the money first. O beloved! O beloved! O beloved! O beloved! O beloved! O beloved! O beloved! O beloved! O beloved! Love isn't enough... O beloved! Love isn't enough... ...fate wants something more. I'm stricken by destiny, what do I do? I'm stricken by destiny, what do I do? I'm stricken by destiny, what do I do? Who has control over destiny? O beloved! O beloved! O beloved! O beloved! On one hand, love is forlorn... On the other, the body is crestfallen. On one hand, love is forlorn... On the other, the body is crestfallen. Both have been rendered helpless such that there's... ...no one to whom I can complain. O beloved! O beloved, what fate have I met? My fate deserves something better. The heart shouldn't break, it is the house of the Lord. In your command my head bows. The heart shouldn't break, it is the house of the Lord. In your command my head bows. I'm not afraid of death. I'm just afraid of being separated from you. O beloved! O beloved! Love isn't enough... ...fate wants something more. O beloved! O beloved! O beloved! O beloved! O beloved! O beloved! O beloved! O beloved! O beloved! O beloved! O beloved! O beloved! O beloved! O beloved! O beloved! O beloved! Whoa! Mark! Don't you know you're not supposed to be here? I've got to see her, man. - Hey! It's the boss' orders. You know how this works. You know how this works, buddy? This is a. 44 magnum with hollow point slugs. Goes in real small comes out real big. Can you handle the damage, buddy? So you can speak English as well, eh? Sometimes. Go and get your bird. Ajju! I've seen smarter guys but none better than you. Mark! Mark! Please take me away from here. - That's what I've come here for. Lisa, today at 7pm at L.A. airport... ...will you wait for me? - Yeah. Ok. - Yes. How did you come inside my club? How did you come in? - Through the door. Then go out through the door. Out! Out! Out! Lisa! I had warned you that I don't want any personal... ...love stories within my club. And Lisa, this good for nothing will give you nothing. Ok? Time for the show, baby. - No more shows. Lisa, go now. I'll meet you at 7pm. Lisa! You leave my club once and you can't come back. She doesn't want to come back. Shut up! Bye! Take care. - I'll take care of you soon. Hey what about a Harry? - Hey man! That's an old piece of shit. This is the new babe. Takes a man out... ...in one shot. I bet! This is a heavy bitch. Like the one with the heavy tits, man? Shall we go, British? - English, brother. - Sorry. Let's move? - Alright. - Come. - Take your babe. - I don't leave home without this, man. Take care, man. Everyone went with a partner. Now sit. Police! Police! I'm the cop. And you're the captive. So lets begin where it all started. Where's the truck? Tell me, who's the policeman? Who's the cop? The money is kept at the back. What do we do? You had said... - Look, Andy. I've never been dishonest throughout my life. You know what kind of people we're working with. One's a cop, and two are crazy... Why should we go back? Let's split the booty here itself. No. - Andy, you're talking like a fool. I know all about you. You've a wife who doesn't want to live with you. A child whom you can't meet. Because you don't have money. Think about it. Such an opportunity won't knock at your door again. You can put your life together again. No, Major. I have a wife who's very ill. You do whatever you want, I won't tell anyone. No one knows how much money we've stolen. No one has counted it yet. What difference will it make if you take a few bundles out of it? You're very straightforward like me. You can't be an informer. Major, you're testing... Major! What's this? Maybe we won't return alive from the place we're headed to. At least this will be of use to someone. The job got successfully completed. Those people were very pleased. I'll book our airline ticket on the way. I'll be back... O Lord, give me back my love. Who'll stand by me if not my companion? I asked you something that belonged to me... Or did I ask for something I didn't own. Or did I ask for something I didn't own. Let her die! Let her die! Let her die as my own. I ask you for your godliness. I ask you for your godliness. I ask you for your godliness. I ask you for your godliness. I ask you for your godliness. You're hanging! You're hanging. Tell me who's the cop. I give you three chances. Tell me, who's the cop. One. Two. Go to hell. Three. Who killed him? I did. Why? Hadn't I killed him then he would've killed that cop. So you killed him? The one with whom you fooled the world... ...today you killed that fellow himself. What could I've done? He had hung him like a donkey. That guy was shouting and Bali was laughing like mad men. How can we kill a policeman? So you killed him in order to save this guy's life? Who said we can't kill a cop? Look, we kill a cop like this. Understood? We kill a cop like this. Ajju! C'mon! What's this? What happened? Who killed him? I killed him. - Why? Because he killed Bali. Who killed Bali? He did. How many times do I explain to you, man? He had gone mad. Not gone mad, he was mad. He was planning to kill everyone and escape with all the booty. You love all of us so much that you killed your companion. Either it's written all over my face that I'm a fool. Or you're so foolish to think that I'm a fool. Just a minute. Look, Mac won't lie. It's true that Bali had gone mad. He had spoken of escaping with the booty, even to me. Bali was mad, Major. But he wasn't a police informer. He wanted to kill a policeman, not save him. Who tried to save the cop? He did. Then who's the rat? Bali or Mac? He saved himself not the cop. Major why are you always taking sides with him? Is there always something happening between you and him? C'mon, Major. I know that you're not that rat. But neither is Ajju nor me. And Andy has been a straight guy right from the beginning. The one remaining is this guy. Listen to me. He took the bullet meant for me and saved my life. Had he been a policeman... ...then why would he have done so? - It could've been an accident. Major, why do you forget that he's been with us... ...just for the past six months. Who knew about him before that? Neither did I know him nor did you? I'm telling you he isn't a cop. Bali was mad but he isn't a cop. Bali was mad, Major. But he can never think of stealing someone's share. If he had wanted to shoot, then he could've shot Bali on his leg. And then he could've waited for us. But no, he was only worried about this dog. He wasn't worried about Bal. I've been telling from the beginning to split... ...the booty and keep moving your own way. One's already gone! Are you waiting for the rest of us to die? C'mon! Do we leave the one who helped the police reach us? Had I been a cop, then wouldn't I've said that Bali's a cop... ...and that that's the reason I shot him. Then I would've torn you to shreds, rascal! Bali hated policemen as much as he hated his father. Andy is right. Let's take our money and move from here. I won't leave while this guy's alive. This guy has to die. Look, Ajju. Today, neither am I going anywhere... ...nor is anyone waiting for me. I couldn't save my wife. I couldn't fulfill the promise that I made to her. I won't let him die. Ok? So why don't you just drop the gun? C'mon! Drop the gun! Drop it! Sorry, Major. But Ajju is right. Drop your gun. I said drop your gun, Major. Who asked you to speak in between? This matter is between Ajju and Major. Stay out of it, man. Shut up! Drop your guns! You're trying to kill the wrong person. I'm not going to stop. - That too for that rogue. - Lower your guns. Save yourself, Major. Major, Ajju is right. Major! Drop your guns, Major! Major, he's dead! Mac! Sorry, buddy. I couldn't save you. I'm sorry, Major. I was just doing my duty. I was only doing my duty. Major... Major, I had told you. I couldn't gather the courage to look into Major's eyes. I just closed my eyes and waited for death. I didn't come to know when it came and went by. Ajju used to say that one day or the other, all of us have to go to hell. Even I'm going there. I know that the rest of them would be waiting for me there. They'll ask me why I did such a thing. I don't know what I'll tell them. I hadn't thought that fate would bring me here. On reaching the goal, we would lose our lives. No one had thought that before coming here... ...joy would leave us. What had we thought and what happened? We're leaving today, telling this world... Oh what happened, Oh God? Oh what happened, Oh God? Oh what happened, Oh God! Oh what happened, Oh God! Was it your fault or mine? Was it your pride or mine? O God, I wouldn't have been so bad... ...hadn't you been so heartless. Just tell me, what did you get by this? By laying these thorns of sorrow in my path. Oh what happened, Oh God! Oh what happened, Oh God! Oh what happened, Oh God! Oh what happened, Oh God! Los Angeles, 12th of May, 2000. Where we six rogues first met. We had thought that we would win over the world... ...but we got screwed instead.
