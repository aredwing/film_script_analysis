How was your trip, madam? - Have you finalise the deal. - You were sure to succeed. - I hope work is progressing smoothly. - Yes, madam. Except for the workers at the tea gardens and coffee plantations. They are creating some noise over the bonus issue. Besides being your estate manager, I am also your niece. I will not bow to their demands. Every year, we profit in millions. The workers should be awarded a part of the profit. - But, madam... - No arguments, please... - How is Ravi's health? - He is fit and fine. - Where is he now? - He received a phone call... Soon after, he left in a hurry. - This is Kamini speaking. - What's the matter? - I hope everything's fine! - I had visited the doctor... - What should I do? - What did the doctor advise? He said I am pregnant! Don't you worry! I am coming! We will get married today. Let's not worry about the consequences! - What about your mother? - Mummy is not here. But I will explain our dilemma to her later. However, we should get married today. I am coming over! No! You know my nature! I cannot bear madam's grief. You could not bear the madam's son too! You fiddled with the car brakes and fixed her son. You can surely help relieve the madam of her grief. Uttering nonsense again! Seems like you are intoxicated! You have become the sole... ...beneficiary of wealth worth millions. If wealth could not intxicate you... ...how will this booze affect me? I cannot forget that I am your servant, sir! You know my nature! I believe in sharing thee booty! This room shall remain locked henceforth. Rll Ravi's belongings will be kept untouched. Whenever his memories disturb me... ...I will visit this room to console myself. Ravi was my favourite student. He was brilliant in studies and sports. When he grew up, he become fond of hunting. Rnd he drew such wonderful sketches. Once I had asked Ravi... ...why he made sketches of only birds, he replied saying. R girl wants to see you. - What's her name? - Kamini! Please believe me! I am speaking the truth. You are lying! Ravi never mentioned you to me! But we knew each other since a long time. - Do you have any proof? - No. My son is dead. But people want to benefit from it too. This girl claims that my son has impregnated her! Now she wants to blackmail me! No. No! I have no evil intentions. You seem to bee unaware of my powers. I can have you jailed! But I don't desire to make my son a laughing stock. Ensure that this girl should not be seen anywhere in the vicinity. I simply want to... Weeping won't help solve matters. You are my wife's close friend. Can I advise you something? Of course! I have no one else to turn to! - Please do advise me! - Get her some drinking water. Don't say heed to what Ravi's mother told you! No. I don't hold any grudge against her. She had never heard of me earlier. In such a situation, how could she have believed then... I am coming, brother. What's this new spectacle in our house these days? Yes, brother. Don't forget that we live in a joint family system! I have two grown-up daughters. If we allow an immoral girl like Kamini to live in our house... ...the gossipmongers in the society would have a field day. It would adversely affect the marriage prospects of my daughters. Please speak in whispers. She's in the adjoining room. Why should I? Have I committed a crime? That girl cannot stay in this house henceforth... Tell me madam, how can I help you? Do you know Sanjay Gupta? How do you do, son? I know him quiet well. He was Ravi's collegue in college. He was in Canada since some time. He returned just today. Ravi had written him this letter. Ravi has mentioned about Kamini in this letter. I insulted Kamini and threw her out of this house. But she had been speaking the truth. What should be done now? I want you to search her and bring her back. Even if she was not officially married to my son... ...I still consider her as my daughter-in-law. ...and her progeny shall be the... ...sole successor of my entire wealth. I could not trace her. I searched every where. I have committed a blunder. Please allow me to atone for my sins. Let's go! Can I tell you something? You have been visiting the temple since years... ...and praying for only one wish. I too would like to share your grief. I too would like to... ...pray to God to unite you with Kamini and her progeny. I have committed a sin. Rnd I would like to atone for it myself. But it's unbearable to watch you suffer in agony! You know my nature! The more I visit this temple, the more my belief strengthens. I am confident that one day, I will meet Kamini... ...and her progeny... I am not going to die without meeting them! Who are these people? This is my identity card. What brings you here? We have received information that you deal in unaccounted gold. This is my team. You have the right to examine their identity cards. This is an official raid. Till we are over with it... ...nobody is permitted to exit or enter the premises. Sir, half of our gold is uncounted for. - We are in for trouble. - I will find a way out. Yes, sir. Rost assurred. Work is progressing smoothly. I suppose we should be able finish it in 2 to 3 hours. Rll right, I will come over. If you permit, may I have a word with you? - Go ahead! - You are an intelligent man. Let's find a way out of this problem... ...so that both of us are content and satisfied. Rre you understanding what I mean to say? - Sir, this jewellery. - Just a minute... I can understand you very well... If you try to bribe me, I will have you arrested! What I meant to say is! Do you believe that you can bribe your way through? Yes, what's the matter? Sir, we have listed this entire jewellery. Have you taken the accountant's acknowledgement? - Yes! - I will return in an hour! Let me speak to Mangaram! - Excuse me. Sir is on the line! - Sir who? It's Mr. Dharmadhikari speaking! Sir, this is Mangaram here! Your hair is turning grey, but you are still so immature! - What did you say? - Now do as I say! Send my boys home. Close your shop... ...and rush to the nearest police station. Wouldn't you report this broad daylight robbery... ...at the police station? "Listen to my advice..." "Do as I say!" "If you listen to my advice..." "I will do as you say!" "Get me the moon!" "Get me the stars!" "Get me more stars!" "If you lust for me..." "If you desire to take me home..." "Why do you worry? Why are you preplexed?" "You can acquire me, but not before you leave!" "The more you consider me as your beloved..." "The more I will be at your disposal..." "It's not tough at all... The destination is not far off!" "If you desire me, you can have me!" - The crook! - He's the one! Catch him! Catch him! Catch him! Catch him! He had come this way! - Thanks for knocking at the door! - What do you mean? People are treating this room as a highway... They come in running, and rush off through the window. Rs it is, this hotel has lost its charm. I am also not keen on continuing here. ...but you are just not scheming anything these days. It's ages since our Ramkot episode! - Which episode? - We sold him a jake diamond! - You did not plan any... - You are right. But as of now, I have a fresh idea. See this! - Who's this girl? - Tara Jai Singh! The only daughter of famous industrialist Dinesh Jai Singh! Rs long as he lived... ...he donated millions in charity to hospitals for the handicapped! His daughter is the sole successor to his entire wealth! In this interview, she states that... ...she will continue the practice... ...of donating money to the handicapped! - Get the idea? - Yes. I get it! There's this famous song from my youth. You will find greener patch someday. She also states in the interview that she visits... ...the Tikamgarh Holiday Resort to relax this month of the year! - Get the idea? - Indeed! When are we leaving? Tomorrow, but let's leave this place first! I will change my dress and join you in a minute! I am sorry if I have caused... ...people to treat your make-up room as a highway! It's difficult to decide if you are a good singer... ...or a good dancer or whether your beauty... ...overshadows these two qualities! I will fondly remember the evening! May I use your window? The Tara Jai Singh idea is truly outstanding! How should I thank you? Please don't mention it! I consider it my duty to donate a share of my earnings... ...to this orphanage. Rfter all, I have lived here for years. Many boys have stayed here for year... ...but who bothers to come back! There are few such boys like you... I have hung pictures of boys like you! You have made considerable progress in your profession... ...of importing and exporting as you have inform me! - I should be leaving now! - How about a cup of tea? Some other time, sir. I am going away for a few days. I have to make necessary preparations! Mother! Mother! Rll right! Inform the doctor that I had called. I am Saradha here. Yes, my name is Saradha. Mother! Why were you shouting? I am not shouting but I am asking you something. - Where are they? - They what? - My cloths! - They are right infornt of you! - Rre your eyes buttons? - Yes, they are buttons! In how many days will you return? Please pray for my quick return, mother! I simply cannot understand the profession of the two of you? If people begin to understand our profession... ...we would have to shut shop. - Can I sit next to you? - Sure! Please sit! You even remember my name! Please repeat my name once more! - I have begun to like my name. - Shut up, you fool! What's so special about me? Why do you girl's go bonkers over me? Your personality is similar to the man of my dreams! Have you gone nuts? There's nothing special about me! How could you estimate your own worth? I want to convince myself that you really exist! Can I touch you and verify for myself? - I want to tell you something! - Speak out! How should I? Everyone is overhearing us! Let's go outside. Let's walk and talk together! - Hello! - Hello! We wish to go for a walk! - What is this place known as? - It's called Cloud Colony! - Cloud Colony? - Yes. It's newly created. - I live here! - You live here? But where? You see that small cloud there. Turn left from there! Left turn from the small cloud there! Oh, I see! Further down, you will find a dark cloud filled with water... My house is located bang opposite that dark cloud! - It's called 'Monsoon Villa'! - Monsoon Villa! - Shall I reveal my feelings to you? - Yes why not? Let's get down to singing and feeling. But let's do it together! "Neither is this the earth Neither is it the skies" "Where have you brought me along?" "Cloud Colony is my home..." "The place where I have brought you along!" "Don't you fool me, dear. Nobody lives on a cloud!" "Come and see it for yourself. Your beloved speaks the truth!" "Strange are the roads in your wonderland." "People on this land walk with their feet on the stars!" "The star that shines brightly I covet that priceless pearl." "The dot on your forehead resembles the moon." "While the sun acts as a mirror for you." "Romantic clouds surround us on all sides." "Faint is the brightness. Bright is the darkness." "The romantic clouds are so thick and dense." "What if they melt down tomorrow?" "Rest assured O beautiful maiden." "I am not one of those who cannot be trusted!" - Shall I tell you something? - Go ahead, Seema! Please fasten your seat belt and stop smoking. We will be shortly landing at the Tikamgarh Rirport! - What about my cottage? - It's booked, madam! I had dialled your number. But you weren't in! Yes I am... What are you watching? There's this famous song from my youthful days... "The heart says... Somebody's arrived!" - Who's arrived? - Tara Jai Singh's arrived! - When? - This morning. - She's reading a book seated in the garden. - Let me see! Shall we go and meet her in the garden? There's this famous song from my youthful days... "Enter the garden with caution, dear..." Do you understand? We will definite meet her... ...but with patience. We will pose as doctors? - Pose as doctors? - Yes. Our greatest ambition... ...in life will be to build a hospital... ...for the helpless and the handicapped! When she forces us too much... ...we shall show her this plan, the blueprint for the hospital. This is the hospital which will put on end to our miscries! We're already attracting patients for your proposed hospital! - What do you mean! - See it for yourself! - Who's he? - He's the same chap I had told you about! - Did you say something to me? - You want to feed those swans! - Shall I? - Would you? How beautiful and peaceful these swans are! Just looking at them gives me tremendous harmony and bliss... ...something which I never derived associating with human beings. So pure and transparent, without any selfish motives. How innocent and honest these creatures are! You might be wondering why I am blabbering in this way... - Rctually, I was... - Rnyway. Thank you very much... You were very helpful. Few care to lend a helping hand those days. - So, he is the one? - Yes. He is the one! I remember that famous song from my youthful days. "Should we finish you? Should we spare you?" "Tell me how you should be dealt with!" What can I do for you? - Get lost from here! - Better hurry! Or else... - Or else what? - We can do a lot for you! - Like what? - We can expose you! - We can get you arrested! - We can have you jailed! What is it? There's this famous dialogue from the famous film... ...from your youthful days... 'Those who live in glass houses... ...do not hurl stones at other's houses.' The dialogue that follows in this particular sequence goes thus. 'Such games are not meant for kids.' Do you understand? Tara Jai Singh is too smart for a kid like you! You are good enough only for the thieves and robbers game. This game is much too sophisticated for you! Whether this game is meant for you, or for me... ...this can be decided when one of us emerges victorious. - Is he challenging us? - Yes. He is indeed mistaken. Rll right, let's go ahead with it. But what will decide the victor? Whichever of us two can squeeze out five lakh rupees... ...from Tara Jai Singh, will be declared the winner. Okay. "Gloomy are my days and nights..." "Ever since you departed." "The brightness in the mornings..." "...has turned darker than the nights..." "Ever since you have gone." "Nights brought along with it." "Deep shadows of memories..." "The moonlight hurts my heart." "How can I sleep then?" "My heart has stopped beating." "Subdued is my heart Ever since then." "Without any purpose I travel through life." "I resemble the temple where Godden resides no more!" "My tears, your flowers. My blood, your divinity!" - Excuss me! - Yes? Oh, it's you! - So early in the morning? - Your song hured me here! There is so much pain in your voice! - I am Tara Jai Singh! - I see! I should be moving! - Excuse me! What's your name? - I am Devdas! Just see how engrossed they are in conversation! The girl appears to be on the verge of inviting him for tea! Let's have tea together! The brute will act fussy first. Tea? With you? Me? Tea? With you? Me? The girl will say, "I will be glad if you have tea with me!" I will be glad if you have tea with me! Glad? How can I make anyone glad? Why can't you make anyone glad? I will come if you insist! - Is it a promise? - Yes, I promise! Rt five o'clock! Five o'clock then! He is climbing the ladder too rapidly. Let's pull away the ladder then! There's this famous song from my youthful days. "There's a thief eyeing your treasure! Rise O traveller!" I have heard it, yes! Let's see when this thief comes to meet Tara... Why don't you stay over some time? No. Rctually I am required at the city. When I learnt about your stay here, I came over to meet you. You seem to have broken ties after your father's demise! No, it's not so. I will definitely visit Chandnipur this time! Please do visit us! - Look at the watch! - It's five sharp! You are very punctual. Let's sit in the lawn! If you had come a bit earlier... ...I would have introduced you to my aunty. Yes. I had noticed her. Who's she? She's the sole owner of the Chandnipur Estate. Tea Gardens, coffee plantations, Jasming, factories she has it all! She is filthy rich! Yet she is all alone in her family! Poor lady! Where is this Chandnipur? Rbout 250- 310 kilometres away from here! What is she doing here then? She is one of the board directors of Grindlays Bank. She came here to attend one of the board meetings. Can I ask you something? - Rsk me whatever you want? - Since when and how did... You want to know since when I am living... ...a life of an handicap on this wheelchair? - I hope you are not hurt! - No. But what will you gain by hearing my job story? If you don't feel like like telling me, it's alright with me! If you have asked me about it, I will tell you! My life today is a night full of grief... ...but there was a time when it was a morning full of bliss! There was Rita in my life then! We had sowed to live life together! We got engaged! We were to be married in a month's time! Rnd then, that ill-fated moment... Rnd then? - What happened thereafter? - Cricket! - Cricket? - Yes! R cricket match was held in our town. Somebody offered us two entry passes for the pavilion! Gavaskar's century, lmran's bowling, Miandad and Kapil Dev... ...five days flow in a jiffy! Rt the end of five days, India won the match... ...but I lost the match of my life. What happened after five days? Rita clean-bowled my love. My dreams met with an L.B.W. Rll my hopes were caught at silly mid-on! - What do you mean? - Rita ran off with lmran! Rfter that incident, I saw the same dream every night... ...that I am running faster than lmran Khan. Rnd one five day, when realisation dawned upon me... I could see my useless feet... ...I had become a burden for the wheelchair! Yet I pray for the well-being of Rita and lmran! - Don't be so remorseful! - Where am I affected? I am laughing. See, I am laughing! I know it was an unfortunate incident! But do not be so disheartened with life. Who knows? Happiness and bliss may... ...be awaiting you round the bend! I am confident that you will recover completely. You can be treated. I can be treated. Yet I cannot be treated. I don't understand! There's a doctor in Indra who can treat me. Dr. Khatpatiya from New Delhi? - Dr. Khatpatiya? - Yes! I had written to him. But when I realised the astronomical... ...sum needed for treatment I concluded... ...that I was not destined to be cured! How could I have arranged five lakh rupees! I will give you the five lakh of rupees! No! Please don't try to rob me of my self-respect and pride! If you ever attempt it again, I will never meet you again! I am leaving. Don't you try and stop me! - Let me be myself! - You are misunderstanding me! What about my self-respect? You call me your friend. Does one friend hurt the other! Rnd don't you worry! I will not mention Dr. Khotpatiya ever again! Seems like my patients will not spare me ever! You are on a vacation! I don't want you to work while holidaying! Rre you the same famous Dr. Khatpatiya from Delhi? I don't know if I am famous, but I am Dr. Khatpatiya from Delhi. I consider myself fortunate to have met you! There's a sick young man who needs your attention! Rnd the doctor needs to relax awhile! This is my chief assistant Dr. Jadibooty! You will have to deal with her! What's your name? You see, he's on a vacation right now. ...and he's booked for 2 years. We cannot accept any new case. Date problems, you see! I am so sorry! If you could spare some time for him. Only you can treat him. - He had even written to you! - He had written to us. - What's the patient's name? - Devdas. Is it the one whose feet... I remember! Isn't he the one whose... ...girlfriend had cluded with a football player! No. It was a cricket player. Imran Khan is the cause of his agony! It's an interesting case. Please spare some time for them. - Okay, Miss Chand Jai Singh... - It's Tara Jai Singh! Let's go and meet your patient! Remember I had told you not to be disheartened with life? Rnd that happiness and bliss may be awaiting you round the bend? Yes, I remember! Bliss is not awaiting you round the bend! Bliss is about to walk in over to you! Guess who I am going to introduce to you just now? Who is it? Dr. Khatpatiya and his assistant Dr. Jadibooti! You need not be so sorrowful any more! We are here now! Rnd we shall treat you in such a manner... ...that you will be cured completely. No, doctor. It's very difficult to cure me! Don't you worry! We will ensure that you even start running... Will Devdas actually start running? Why not? We will make him run! Did you hear, Devdas? He can hear as well understand. But before we start treating you... ...we would like to understand your problem throughly! - Can you feel anything? - No. Not at all! Today, we will only conduct a check- up. Thereafter we will decide about the course of treatment! - Can't you feel any tingling sensation? - No. Not at all. No problem. You will feel it! We will have to examine him thoroughly. - Can you feel it now? - No. Not even now? If you hit him hard at one point, he may feel it! Let's try it out! You did not feel anything even now? Stop! He might be experiencing pain! Rlas! Only if can experience pain and discomfort! If he experience discomfort, his legs would've come back to life! He will definitely get curred. That's our responsibility. There's this famous song form my youth... "Darkness lasts only for the night..." "Whoever can prevent the advent of dawn!" Look, doctor! His eyes are filled with tears of joy! I was saying that... No, let it be! - Speak out frankly! - Tell me! What's the matter? Let me caution you about this matter. I request you not to discuss my fees with Devdas! I don't understand? He should not feel that you are helping him. Rfter being betrayed by a girl, Devdas has lost his confidence. He doesn't trust himself anymore! There's this song that I recall from my youth... ...that will explain his state of mind! "I am walking away helpless, from your world." "I am going away, far off, far off..." If another girl like you happens to burden him... ...with a favour of five lakh rupees... ...it will break the poor chap's heart to pieces! He may possibly suffer a paralytic attack due to... ...inferiority complex and he may be unable to move his limbs. He may end up being nothing more than a mere statue! Only a statue! I will never mention the fees in his presence. But how did you manage to ring the door bell. Shall I demonstrate? This is how! Please come in! I have come to discuss something with you! Sure! But would you like a drink first? No! You take your seat first! What's the matter? Rre you alright? I am quite fine. I haven't felt better since ages! I have realised that my ailment is not physical... ...but a psychological one! If I am able to shun off remorse and hopelessness... ...I can succeed in standing on my own feet! I will be able to walk then! You are right! You are quite right! Rnd I don't need a doctor to help me help myself! R girl had ruined my love life... ...and had subjected me to this wheelchair! You could dispel the vacuum in my love life... ...and liberate me from the bondage of this wheelchair! How unbelievable of you! Yes, indeed! You have come like a ray of hope for me! Yesterday night, it seemed like somebody whispered in my ears... ...that if Tara encourages and cheers you up... ...you can stand on your own feet once again! You will walk! I will encourage you! I will chear you up! You can walk once again! Tara urges you to do it! - Rise! Get up, Devdas! - But how? Listen to me! Trust me! You can stand up! Get up! Get up! Yes! Don't lose courage! Keep trying! I am standing! I am standing on my own feet! You can walk too! March forward now! O my God! Bravo, Devdas! Bravo! Come forward! Watch out! Don't worry! I can walk! I can walk! I don't want any doctor! I don't want a Khatpatiya or a Jadibooti! I only need you! - Come forward, Devdas! - I am coming, Tara! I am indeed walking! I can walk now! You will change my life. You see, Miss Tara Jai Singh? You are geniuses! They have cured you! But I myself... They had already told me that you may come today... ...and that if you come... ...you will stand on your feet all by yourself! But how did you get to know this in advance! We understand our patients' psychology very well! We know when and how our patients recover from ailments! Why not? There it is. I will fetch it! What's the matter? You don't look as happy as you ought to be! - I am very happy! - Try to understand his dilemme! He concealed his grief for so long! Now, he's hiding his joy! His heart now wants to sing this famous song from my youth... "Gloomy days are begone now Happy days are here again!" His heart is presently overwhemed with emotions of excitement! He can faint down out of joy! I am finding it difficult to contains my joy! This is to celebrate your recovery... What's the matter? - What's happened to him? - He's fainted! Why has he fainted? I had already told you that he is presently overshelmed... ...with emotions of excitement! He could faint any time! Rnd he fainted! Now listen what you should do! Before he regains consciousness... ...you should distance yourself from him! But why, doctor? He has just recovered, and... Do you want his feet to be impaired once again? Certainly not! Then do as we say! He should be totally convinced... ...that he has recovered on his own and not by someone's did! Only then can he gain self-confidence... ...and he will be able to stand on his own feet! Rll right! You know better! I will do as you say! Before I leave, your five lakh rupees... Yes, of course! She is leaving now, you may collect five lakh rupees in cash! I will have to sit by his bedside till morning! Where's the madam who was staying here? She has left, sir! Rnd what about Dr. Khatpatiya and Jadibooti? What names did you say, sir? We could have extracted more money from Tara Jai Singh! Never stretch a rubber so much that it breaks! We have squeezed five lakh rupees! That's lot of money! Get down! - What crime have we committed? - Would you like to know? You have committed a fraud alongwith one Mr. Rrun Kumar! R fraud amounting to five lakh rupees! Five lakhs! What five lakhs? What are you alleging, inspector? Miss Tara has filed a complaint against the three of you! She should be arriving any minute now! Put them in the lock-up till she arrives! Hey! Why don't you understand? How could the matter take a turn for the worse? Thanks to that Rrun Kumar or Devdas, we have had to... ...find ourselves behind bars for the first time in our lives! Yes, indeed! You find yourself behind bars for the first time in your life... ...and what about me? You speak as if I've lived my life in prisons! This is the first time... ...that I find myself in a soup, all due to you! What do you mean? You acted in a haste! Now you can make merry with your five lakhs! - But... - I am sure he has blundered somewhere. Because of him... Whether we like it or not, we are aboard the same ship! Instead of quarelling, let's think of a way out! Our predicament reminds me of this famous song from my youth... "The bird is a captive. When the consort smiles..." "It becomes difficult to explain, it becomes difficult to bear!" You appear to be a gentleman! How could you get entangled in... I can understand... I wasn't such a person earlier. I was a decent and honest man. My two brothers handled my business. One fine day, my brothers cheated me of my money. I found myself a bankrupt man. Even my beloved wife passed away! That day I realised the fact of life... It's all so futile! Everything, every person is up for sale! One has to simply ascertain the right price! You can win over any person you desire! You are right. Can't we win over this cop too? Why not? Don't talk in riddles! Speak out frankly. Listen carefully! We have five lakh rupees in our bag. If Tara Jai Singh gets back her money, and we end up in jail... ...none of us is likely to benefit at all! Rll of us can benefit, if we don't go to jail... ...and you reveive the five lakh rupees... ...instead of Tara Jai Singh! You are trying to bribe me! You are right, inspector! We are indeed bribing you with five lakh rupees! - Saved our souls! - We are back to square one! We lost all that we gained. It was a wasteful exercise! If there is any game which we can play together... ...you can contact us at this number in Bombay! We shall take your leave now. You never told me about your brothers and your wife earlier! How could I? I cooked it all up sitting in the prison! - You mean it was all a lie? - Yes, of course! - But why did you lie? - Should I lie only when I stand to gain? However, Rrun Kumar had turned emotional hearing my rob story! What happened? I have left behind my vanity case at the police station! Quick! Drive back to the police station! Take away the phone or we will have to pay today's rent too. Excuse me! Why are you dismantling the police station? Rre you shifting it elsewhere? We had created a police station set! Do it fast. - Who are you? - I am the production manager. - Get me some tea, quick! - R short while ago, there was... It was a fake police station. Everything is artificial in a shooting! R gentleman had hired his set form us for a couple of hours! - Won'd go get me some tea? - What about the policemen? - They were all fake policemen! - Our five lakh rupees? That bloody Devdas has pocketed the booty! You acted fabulously! This is for you! - But you were splendid too! - Please have it, sir! I won't eat any eatable as yet! I need to starve myself for a couple of days! Would you like to perform another small act for me? Catch him. - What happened? - R man snatched madam's purse and ran away! I hope it did not contain too much money! No. Not more than 8 to 10 thousand. But it contained some very important documents! Your purse, madam! - Where did you find this purse? - I had chased that thief! - Yes, he had chased the thief! - I caught hold of him... He escaped, but I pulled back your purse! Please check if the contents are safe! I was worried about these documents! Here, keep this for yourself! No! Please don't embrass me! I simply did my duty! Good bye, madam! Excuse me! You have helped me out! Can I do something for you? If you could help me secure employment! I am in distress! What's happened to him? - Why don't you sit down, madam? - I am quite comfortable! There's nothing to worry! He has regained consciousness! But what caused him to lose consciousness? He appears to be an unemployed youth! His stomach was empty. I think he hasn't eaten since three days. How strange! He was starving since three days... ...and yet he returned you the purse full of money! He even refused madam's offer to reward him! Can I meet that young boy? - Keep yourself comfortable! - I am fine. Please be seated! You took the unnecessary trouble of coming here! No, not at all! Where do you live? Should we inform your family members? - I have no relatives! - None at all! My mother died as soon as I was born. My father nurtured me! But he too died when I was fifteen! I was left alone! One day, I... No, do not tend to be nagative. What was your father's profession? He was a teacher. He always told me that honesty is his only possession. I am passing on this prized possession to you! He told me never to squander it away! I'm unsure if I will be able to safeguard my father's principles! Why couldn't you? You are already safeguarding it! Your father would have been proud of you, had he been alive! You need a job, and I need an honest person like you! Henceforth, you shall work for me! I am taking you along! Come, Rrun. Hello, Madam. - I hope you're all right, madam! - Yes. What could happen to me? I was informed that a thief ran off with your purse! Hearing this news, Mr. Balwant was over come with anxiety! You know my nature! This is Rrun! He rescued my purse from the thief! Henceforth, Rrun will work here. Take his belongings to the guest room. There's your room! Not that one! Your room is over here! That room is closed since years! Please come, sir! Why is that room closed since years? That was the room of madam's only son, Ravi! - Okay. Do you like your room, sir? This bottle? It must belong to the guests who had stayed here last week. Please give it to me, sir! If you had anything please press the bell! Rll those tea and coffee plantations belong to us! You own all this land? Till what point? Till your eyes can see! Rnd much beyond! - Come. - Come, Rrun. - Here, take this! - One more cheque, madam! Gosh! You have converted me into a signature machine! Take it. The blueprints for the coffee seeds processing plant is ready! If you could have a look at it... Rll right! I am coming! You had told me last time that you wish to start music class. But we will need a music teacher first! Insert an advertisement! We will find a music teacher! Let's place an order for the musical instruments too... ...along with our order for goods for the science lab! I am feeling embarrassed by taking... ...undue advantage of your generosity! This school, so many orphanges so many widow homes... - I am simply oveerwhelmed! - Please don't mention it! The fact remains that there's a helpless widow... ...somewhere in the world, and I caused her misery! How can I forget her progeny? I have made the child an orphan! You view yourself too harshly, madam! Sir, you could have ringed the bell to call me! - Can I come in? - You are welcome, sir! You have a pretty nice room! Madam takes proper care of her employees, sir! - Can I help you, sir? - Fetch me two glasses! - I am not used to drinking alone! - Sir? Don't bother about formalities! Go and fetch two glasses! Since when are you employed here? I have lived my life here, sir! I find that madam is a very lonely person... ...although she has all the riches in the world! You guessed it right, sir! Madam blames herself... ...for all that happened following her son's death! - What had happened? - Her son was going steady with a girl. But madam had been unaware about it. By the time she got to know about it... ...through Ravi's friend, Sanjay Gupta, it was too late already! Remember you had asked me to get in touch with you... ...if there was a game which could interest all three of us! There is one such game! R grand and sophisticated one! - Would you be interested? - Of course! Why not? - It's Rrun on the line! - Rrun who? - The same one! - I see! - He wants to meet us! - Let him meet us! What's all this? Is this the done thing? You are intelligent people! That's why we know that you wish to dupe us again? - Dupe you? You think so? - Yes! In fact, I have come with a lucrative offer. Give us our five lakh rupees first! Rdd the amount towards interest too! You cannot see beyond the pennies! Think big, man! Think big! How big? I am talking of course, not thousands or lakhs! Have you heard of Chandipur Estate? Yes, we have heard of it! - Where did you hear about it? - You just mentioned it! Don't take it lightly. It's a huge estate. The owner of the estate, Sulakshna Devi... ...is on the lookout for her son's progeny! She doesn't even know if her grandchild is a male or a female! I will have it established that you are her granddaughter! The property is worth in crores! We can split it fifty-fifty! Hold on! If she doesn't even know if her grand child... ...is a male or a female, why don't you... I could have declared myself as his grand son. But I had already lied to her that I was a school master's son! That's why I had no choice! Rll right! We see the picture! Now tell us your modus sperandi! Remove these guns first! Then we can talk business! - Hey! These are just toys! - Toys! Yes! See! This is the photograph of Ravi, the son of Sulakshna Devi. These are the sketches which were drawn by Ravi himself. Rnd this story book which had been gifted to him at the school. - So? - These things will help me... ...establish you as her granddaughter! - How will that be? - I will tell you! - But first tell me if you are willing to split? - We accept! Fourty... fourty plus two is fourty two. Fourty two plus. - Yes, what's the matter? - I will tell you that later. First, I advise you to learn etiquette. Stand up and speak. Stand up! Rnthony is away on a long leave. Have you fixed up a replacement? I had inserted an advertisement in the local newspapers! We have received many applications! Rnd a candidate has come in person too! - Where's the candidate then? - He's the one! This fellow will handle the responsibilities of a butler? He has worked as a butler at many places! He possesses certificates too! I wish to seek Mr. Balwant's approval for his appointment! Keep quiet! Come here! I am addressing you! Where have you worked earlier? Rll my life, I've been employed with Kings and emperors... Don't you brag about your links with kings or emperors? I don't find this man deserving. Rppoint somebody else! I will consult Mr. Balwant before taking a final decision. How will it help? I have given my verdict already. You had better go away! I have to accompany the madam to the school... - Shall I go, sir? - No! You had better wait! Hasn't madam come down yet? No. She hasn't. But Mr. Rrun is climbing up rapidly. - What do you mean to say? - I mean to say that... This poor man had come to seek a job as a butler. I asked him to wait. To seek your final decision! - Then? - He was questioning the logic of consulting you! This man will not do, he said bluntly. You should have seen his high-handed behaviour! He seems to be flying too high! - What's your name! - Sir? He is the real boss here. Rppointments and dismissals are at his discretion. But that gentleman had told me to go away! Who's he? What's his position? You may join duty from today. - Sir, my certificates! - You need not show it! If I've decided to appoint you, means that you are appointed! Just don't bother about what that petty man says. Thank you, sir. That gentleman had refused me work. But by employing me, the favour bestowed by you... ...reminds me of this famous song from my youth... "You are my mother you are my father." "You are my brother you are my friend!" This is how I feel about you at the moment! You sing quite well! Today, we are scheduled to select a new music teacher at the school. I would have gladly appointed you, had I known earlier! How many years have you taught music to children? - For seven years, madam! - Rll right! Please register your address outside. We will inform you later! Rll right, sir! - What's your opinion, principal? - She's the best candidate so far. Let's see if there is a better choice. She is the final candidate for today's interview. - Good day! - Good day! Please take your seat! We have seen your qualifications. But tell me, how come you selected music as your subject? I don't treat music as my subject, nor as my hobby. Music is worship for me. Music is as vital to life as breath is to a human body! In your opinion, what is the best way to teach music to children? Childern are like the flower buds who have yet to blossom! Flowers cannot blossom through strong currents of winds... ...but through soft and light gushes of winds. I feel that childern should not be taught the intricacies... ...of musical notes head-on. First, they should be introduced... ...to the world of music by way of light... ...simple and childlike songs. Childlike songs? Okay then, let's hear you sing a childlike song! R childlike song! 24 Yes, indeed! We would like to hear one! "Listen to my advice..." "Listen to my advice... Do as I say!" "If you listen to my advice... I will do as you say!" Chant Hari Hari Om! That's enough! It's all right! Rll right, then! You may register your address outside! But I don't have a local address! I have arrived here today itself! Rnd when I reached here, I learnt that... ...they don't live here anymore. It's all right! You may wait outside. If you are selected for this job... ...we will provide you accomodation too! The committee has to arrive at a decision now. In my opinion, this girl... ...and the one before her both are eligible. I feel Mrs. Chatterjee would be a better choice! It's for a committee to decide. Rnd you are not a committee member. - I was just offering my... - No! Please! I found this girl a perfect choice. You agree with me, don't you? Rll right. Let's appoint her then! - Give her the appointment letter! - Yes, madam! Mrs. Chatterjee was not a bad choice. But this girl is better. - Yes. - R candidate had come personally for the butler's job. - Yes. I know. I asked him to... - I know. You know my nature. I have appointed him too! Because I found him better! - Welcome, sir! - I was passing by. I thought of enquiring if you need anything. In the present age, when humanity is fast... ...becoming a rare commodity you care for me so much! You are our school teacher... ...and as yet unfamiliar with this place. It's our responsibility to care for you. What a pure outlook! I should indeed offer you a cup of tea! Leave the formalities aside! Rll right! If you insist! But please be quick! I will not waste a moment, Sir! Please be seated! Rll right! Time is like a bird. It flies constantly. But you should admit that I did not make you wait long. This sketch? I am fond of making such sketches since childhood. But I don't know why I only draw birds! How much sugar, sir? - Can I borrow these sketches? - Why not, sir! But what's so special about them? Years ago, one of my students... ...used to draw very similar sketches. He too drew only birds! You are right. The sketches have a striking resemblance... ...to the one's drawn by Ravi. What's more astonishing in that... Seema too draws sketches of birds alone! What a strange co-incidence! I wasn't infavour of her appointment... ...but I should admit... ...that she does seem to belong to a respectable family. Bring her to me some day! The rabbit told the lion, O king of the jungle! There lives one more lion in this jungle. The lion roared with rage! Rnother lion in my jungle! Where is he? The rabbit pointed out... Children, don't make noise. I will be back soon! You seem to have befriended the children very easily! Children are like clay. They can be moulded as we may desire! But to make them listen to us, it's important to befriend them! For instence, today, the children weren't keen on music lessons! So I offered a story narration. This story book for children is really interesting. I have been reading it since childhood... ...yet I enjoy the stories as much as I did as a child. Where did you find this book? What did she reply then? She said that the book is a momento of her father... ...whom she has never ever seen! But are you sure that this is the same book? Rbsolutely! I had gifted this book to Ravi when he was in school. Here is my signature on the book! Do you mean to say that... ...is that bloody girl draws similar sketches... ...or if this book bearing your signature was... ...originally presented by you... ...are we supposed to accept her as Ravi's missing child? No, I don't say so. But it is an unusual occurrence! Yes! It is indeed an unusual occurrence! What if she is really my Ravi's daughter? Don't be ridiculous! We can't jump to conclusions on the basis of this book! Let's talk to Seema. Let's ask her about her family background! Even if she hasn't met her father... ...she must know his name at least! I wouldn't advise you to do so. Even if she get slightly suspicious... ...about our plans to establish if she is your successor, ...who knows she might even lie to us! What do you say, Mr. Balwant? Yes, of course! He is absolutely right! Yet, I disagree. I feel we should find out more about her! Sir, if her room is searched, we could find something definite... ...which could give us a clue about her identity. I get it! You may go! I suggest we search her belongings in her absence! We may find something about the girl! That wouldn't be the done thing! We understand your viewpoint. But if we suspect that... ...she could be madam's granddaughter, then... ...isn't it better to clear one's doubts? The doubts will be cleared. Madam, let me do this task! You come along! Could this girl indeed be my son's daughter? I can find nothing except clothes! Did you find anything? I can find nothing except books and ball pens! What's this? He was Ravi's friend, who migrated to Canada years ago. Don't you remember? When we interviewed her, she had told us... ...that the family with whom she planned to stay... ...did not live here any longer? Perhaps she was referring to Sanjay Gupta! But I wouldn't advise reading someone's personal letter! Let the madam pacify herself. Please, madam. Go ahead! What's the matter, madam? What does the letter say? What's all this? Give me the letter! Dear Sanjay, I wouldn't be alive... ...by the time you receive the letter. Seema could be left all alone after my demise. I'm sending her to you. She is the daughter of Ravi, your dearest friend. Please care for her! The unfortunate one, Kamini! She is truly... No! It cannot be! What cannot be? It's already happened! Seema is the daughter of Ravi and Kamini! But, but... Rren't you happy that I've met my son's missing daughter? Rctually, he is finding it hard to believe that... ...so much of happiness can befall him so suddenly! Yes. I cannot believe it, really! I believe it. But I would like to leave no room for doubts! Fetch Seema here! You have already met madam! Hello everybody. Madam wants to discuss something with you! Discuss with me? Well! If you're dissatisfied with my performance at school... That's not the case! Do you recognise him? This is my father's picture! Where did you get it? See madam! The lie has been exposed! I know that if she was a fraud... ...she would blunder at this juncture! Rnd she did blunder! What are you talking about? What's the issue? You had told the principal that... ...your father had died before you were born! - Yes! - It's obvious then... ...that you had never seen your father at all! Yes. I never saw him! But... Then how could you identify your father's picture? - Why am I being interrogated? - We will tell you that later! You should explain how you could recognise your father's picture... ...if you had never seen him? - Yes Seema! Rnswer her! This is how! This is my mother's locket! Rs long as she lived... ...she kept this picture close to her heart! Is Kamini not alive anymore? Do you know my parents? What's the matter? - You are Seema, aren't you? - Yes. She is your grandmother! Oh! So it's you! My father's mother! The one who insulted my mother and threw her out! My mother had not disclosed your whereabouts to me! - I never knew it was you! - Listen to what I have to say! If I had know it was you, I wouldn't have come here at all! - Daughter! - Don't call me your daughter! Our relations have no meaning! You have severed relations... ...with me even before I was born! Do you believe that you can flash your wealth... ...and influence me to come back to you? It's impossible! I'm leaving this place today itself! - Stop! - Do you wish to say something? I don't deny you your grief and anger! But there is more to the truth. It's also true that your unfortunate grandma... ...has suffered for years, repenting her mistake. Rlso true is the fact that she has tried her best to trace... ...Kamini's and your whereabouts! If the grief in your eyes is true... ...the regret emanating from her eyes is genuine too! The incidents did take a turn for the worse... ...but nobody can be held responsible! Forget the past! Rnd remember... ...that you are the only daughter of her only son! Remember that she is your grandmother! - Grandmother! - Daughter! - Grandma! Grandma! - My daughter! Grandma! Grandma! Congratulations on your reunion with your missing niece! Do not weep! Happy days are here again! We should celebrate! Inform the gentry about it! I wish to invite them to the celebrations! It's all a matter of destiny! Madam was destined not to meet her granddaughter for so many years. Rnd when destiny desired, the two met each other! The father too played a great role in the reunion! He was the first to sense it! If he hadn't been... Man cannot accomplish anything till he desires! I agree with him! Be careful, sir! Don't bite off the glass even as you drink! What's the matter? Everything's fine, I hope! Yes. Everything's fine! Who's he? He's the Prince of Hathipur Estate! Let him be! But you shouldn't dance in such a cheap manner! - What have I done? - What kind of a dance was it? You were laughing with him. How would people react? - Well, why should I bother? - Yes. Why should you? Ours is a fifty-fifty partnership. Whatever else I do is none of your concern! Go now! Your darling prince is waiting for you! I'll have to do something about it! Henceforth, think well before you act! You appointed that girl simply to snub Rrun! It was you who suggested the idea of searching her house! Rnd thus that letter resulted in a severe setback to you! How could I know that a small envelope would present... ...a complication of such magnitude! It's for the first time that... ...a mountain emerged out of a mole hill. Till yesterday, you were the sole successor to the madam. Today, that girl has replaced you! Yes, I know your nature! You'll surely do something about it! By now, madam must have given you... ...jewellery worth at least twenty lakh rupees! I don't know it's exact worth... ...but here's the list of items for your records... ...so that there's no scope for confessions later! Later? What do you mean? Our's is a fifty fifty partnership! I want my share right now! I would end up as a dumb idiot if you vanish with the booty! You think everyone will be a cheat like you! We had better not debate over honesty and dishonesty. But he should realise that if I give him his share now... ...and if Madam wants to have a look at the jewellery later... ...do I tell her that my partner has taken away half the jewels? But Rrun too has a valid point. He is entitled to his share! - But what's the solution? - There's a solution! - What's it? - Whatever she picks from home... ...I will take it's equivalent from the office. Rll right! House is for you, and office for you! It's a fair deal, isn't it? I remember this famous song from my youth... "Extend a helping hand O friend..." "R lone person will be exhausted..." "Share the burden between yourselves!" But how will we make it happen? I will show you how! I had directed Balwant to come at ten o'clock! - He hasn't arrived yet. - He must be coming any moment. He was working at the office till two in the night! That must have delayed his arrival. Rm I right! Yes, of course! Balwant's workload equals that of ten people! - Rm I right, Hasmukhlal? - Yes madam! She is right! - Everything's fine, I suppose! - Yes, sir! "You are my mother! You are my father!" Madam was enquiring about you! I took the load and told her... ...that you were busy working at the office till two last night! You are my brother! You are my friend! I was held up at the office till two last night! I could have finished the work today. But you know my nature! Yes, I know everything. Sit down, and listen to what I say. Yes, of course. If you work so hard, what will be the state of your health? I've decided to let Rrun handle half of your work! I have been very unfair to you, I never gave it a thought ever! It was Seema, who explained your predicament to me! What is this happening, boss? She is the successor of the house. Rnd now this man is capturing the office. You don't have any authority at either of the places! I cannot dare label you an underdog! You can call me the dog, if you like! But now we have nowhere to go! You know my nature! I'm not an underdog. I'm an blacksmith! Haven't you heard the saying? One blow of a blacksmith equals hundred blows of a goldsmith! It's also possible that... ...the goldsmith vanishes with the loot... ...while the blacksmith ends up dangling his tool like a fool! Better hurry up, sir! Or these two will gain complete control. I won't let that happen. I'll investigate if Kamini is dead or alive! I'll verify if she ever had a child... ...and if she did deliver a child, I'll find out where it is! Encash this cheque, from the bank tomorrow. Rll right, madam! It's more than three months since Balwant's gone. - Yes, three months have gone by! - How strange? It's three months! Stranger is the fact that... ...there hasn't been any communication from his end. Yes! I'm also quite concerned about him. I would like to meet Mr. Vinod Mishra. I'm Vinod Mishra. How can I help you? So you're the one! I'd so much difficulty tracing you! Rnd suddenly, Kamini went away without informing us. That was our last meeting with her! She was a close friend of my wife! But the problem was that my elder brother was an orthodox man. Where could she have gone? Do you have some idea? Please try and remember! She may have indicated... Yes! R few days after she left... ...I discovered an address of a maternity home from her room. But fearing my brother, I didn't disclose it even to my wife. What was the address? Which maternity home was it? I'll try to remember. But why are you so desperate? For her own benefit. You know my nature. But no! How can you? Rfter all, we're meeting for the first time! Rctually, her uncle has passed away. If I can locate her... ...I would hand over the property and wealth to her. ...or to her daughter, if I can find her! Kamini's daughter? But she never had a daughter! Kamini had a son? But how do you know? You said that you never met her again! I never met her. But she had met my brother near a temple. She was in tatters. She had a sick one-year-old infant with her! My child is very ill! If he isn't treated soon, he will not... Please help me! Nobody can help you! Your sins are taking their toll now! It will be in the child's interest that you stay from him. Leave your child in that swing. Somebody else will nurture him. So Kamini's daughter was never born? Grandma! - I am annoyed with you! - Why? Why did you visit me in my bedroom this morning? I long to see your face the first thing in the morning! What's so special about my face? I didn't see your face today. Rnd I fell ill today. You fell ill? What's ailing you, grandma? Cold, of course! I am Tara speaking! I phoned in to congratulate you. Prince of Hathipur told me that after so many years... It's my good fortune! Oh, so you are coming! That's good news, indeed! Yes, of course! You should come and meet my grand daughter! Rll right, you may come today itself! - Who is she, grandma? - Meet her this afternoon. She is a very decent girl. It's good that you came. Rs it is, I am feeling sick. One of my guests is arriving in her private plane! You may welcome her! This is the blueprint of our proposed buildings. - Who's coming? - She's my old friend's... Your medicines, madam! Yes, she's my old friend's... Excuse me! Remove the plates! What was I saying? You said she's your old friend's... ...that's all you said! - She is his daughter! - Is it? What happened? I felt as if there were an earthquake! What name did you say? When is she coming? She has her own plane. She will be here in two hours! What's happening to you? How should I explain? I see darkness all around me! You too appear to have fallen sick. You may take a holiday today! Time to pack the bags! The game will end shortly. It lasted while it lasted! Why do I see everything upside down? If you lie down upside down, you will see everything jumbled! Sit straight and think straight! It's time to evaluate, not to think! I remember this famous song from my youth... "Fly off O bird... The land is turning hostile!" I meant to say that rush to your rooms and start packing! Not so easily! If you're so fond of imprisonment, you may stay back. - We are leaving! - Yes, indeed! Why wouldn't you? You will head straight for Hathipur! Yes indeed! To that Prince of Hathipur! The one with whom you were dancing the other day! So you are still experiencing the pain? I have already reminded you once. We share a 50-50 partnership. Why should you be bothered... ...about whom I meet, what I do, and where I go? I will not be bothered. Why should I? Rnd why would I? What's happening to you? Let's not quarrel with each other! Looks like you have turned insane... ...after knowing about Tara Jai Singh! I haven't turned insane. But I don't know about others. You mean to say? - Yes, why not? - He's really turned insane! I haven't turned insane. Let her arrive! - What is this that I see? - It's a small world, you see. - How are you? - I am fine! But you cannot imagine how I feel seeing you here! But you cannot imagine how I feel about seeing you here! - But what are you doing here? - I am the general manager here! It's because of you that I find myself here! Had I not met you there, I wouldn't have been here! - She's coming! - Let her! - How is Balwant! - He isn't around these days! We are close to this family since many years. That's why wish to brief you about... ...something you know nothing of! - What's that? - Please be seated! - What's the matter? - Please sit down first! I don't know how I should convey it to you! You must be aware about madam's traumatic experience years ago! - I know! Her son, Ravi... - Yes! That's the crux... Madam has nurtured this grief and this grief and loneliness... ...is slowly eating into her thinking power. She is talking pointlessly and waywardly these days! Has she turned mad? No. No! Not at all! She doesn't bite at all! It's turned off! She isn't prepared to get herself treated! But, we should do something for her! I have done all that I could! Dr. Jadibooty and Dr. Khatpatiya are both here! But you say that she isn't willing to get herself treated! That's why I have not disclosed to her that they are doctors! Madam has mistaken them for somebody else! What did she mistake them to be? Her mental state is so worsened that she considers... ...Dr. Jadibooty to be her missing granddaughter? - Rnd Dr. Khatpatiya? - He's not a doctor! - He isn't a doctor? - No! He is a noble man! He agreed to pose as a butler to treat madam! He is truly a noble soul! He is entitled to a Nobel Prize! - Why don't you meet madam? - Can I not avoid meeting her? Don't worry. She doesn't bite. Neither does she hit... Nor does she throw things! There is no violence involved! It will be an emotional experience! Just accept however the madam addresses Dr. Jadibooty... ...and you had better address Dr. Khatpatiya as a butler! Rnd address me as Rrun! Last week she started addressing me as Rrun! Don't oppose or deny any of her statements! These are Dr. Khatpatiya's strict instructions! - Come. - Should I come? - Yes. Rnd don't exhibit any emotions of fear on the face! Smile! Present a happy picture! Laugh! Do you see? She is reading the newspaper upside down! - Grandma! - Where have you been, Seema? - How is your health now? - Same as ever! Rrun should have brought Tara along by now! We have arrived, Madam! Why are you standing there? Come here! Come close to me! I will introduce you to my grand daughter later. First, you should embrace me! - What else? - Everything's fine! The last time we met, you appeared pink like a rose! Today, you are yellowish! Me? Yellow? Yes, indeed! I have turned yellow! Come. Sit here. Why did you turn yellow? Don't you care for yourself? You are absolutely right! I don't care for myself! - But it's not the done thing! - You're right! No, you're wrong! - No, no! You're right! - This is my granddaughter! - Your medicine, madam! - Medicine? Once more? This medicine is for treating your cough and cold! If you don't take medication, how will be normal again! You are my grandma, aren't you? Do you have any doubts? Hurry up, then. Rnd take this medicine! - Do you see her devotion? - Yes, of course! Give me the medicine! I'll be back shortly! Make yourself comfortable. You may chat with them till then. Yes, grandma. Did you feel it? - Rrun? Did you hear? - I am coming, madam! She cannot bear to be alone for a moment! Don't be scared! Everything will be fine! You are wonderful human beings, really! We are trying our best to set things right! Please pray that we succeed in our mission! You have all my best wishes! Ours is a thankless job. When madam recovers... ...she will not even remember how we treated her! What about your fees then? It hardly matters! Fees is not the only criterion! One should be willing to contribute towards humanity. No! It's not right! You should receive you fees! What are you doing, Tara? I'll pay you your fees! We shouldn't be accepting the amount! - One Thousand only? - No. One lakh! - One lakh! Why don't you convince her to avoid paying the amount? She won't listen to our pleas! She is a very determined lady! - We didn't need it! - Of course, you need it! You are being too courteous! You may tear off this cheque... ...but I'll encash it and give you the cash forcibly! I'll show you around the estate! What's this new act? We shouldn't leave them alone. He might be having some aces up his sleeve! Till that girl boards the plane, we shouldn't leave them alone! It's good that we had this drive before you left. This place is really scenic... ...but there's hardly any worthy person to share it with! With you by my side, the last two days were real fun! Stay a little longer, please! She has other important responsibilities too! I agree! But something seems to be burning somewhere! Something is burning somewhere! Please take care of aunty! Please be careful! Please stay back comfortably! I'll escort her to the plane! - Do you see? Do you notice? - Notice what? You feign as if you aren't aware of what I mean to say! Till you tell me something, how can I know of it in advance? - How innocent you are! - Since childhood! You always keep pointing at me, and accuse me of cheap behaviour! Rnd the way you were behaving with her, was it any less cheap? I had only danced at the party! But you were flying kisses! I'll repeat what you told me. We are fifty-fifty partners! Rnything else I indulge in my lookout! Your lookout! My foot! You dared to ask her to stay back. What it she had stayed back, and we would have been exposed? Who would accept the blame then? We could have ended up behind bars! What do you say? Tell us what you think right! Was I behaving the way she alleges? The fact is that you are fooling each other. The truth is that the two of you have fallen in love... ...but you don't have the courage to admit it! - What are you saying? - Listen to me! Talk it over frankly. Here I go. Listen to me. He seems to be losing common sense. How can I love you? - Rctually, he's going berserk. - Rbsolutely. No sensible man can believe that I could fall for a girl like you! What's so special about you? Do you think you are a dream man? Rnd do you think yourself to be a goddess of beauty? I'm much better than you! I wouldn't think twice before dumping ten girls of your kind! What do you think yourself to be? Remember that I could throw etiquette to the winds! - Leave me! - I won't! "I want to write a letter. But I wonder..." "How should I convey..." "...that I have fallen in love with you!" "Listen to me, just write that..." "Your eyes have been overpowered by dreams!" "Rs I lift the pen and paper..." "The heart races faster than ever..." "Whatever you may write..." "You won't be able to suppress your true feelings!" "I am fine here..." "I should convey this at least"! "How can I write that I have fallen in love with you." "I've decided to at least write..." "...that since a few days, I wonder why..." "I find this world a beautiful place to live in!" "Rlso write that through out the day..." "You keep company with a man without whom..." "...you find life dry and boring." "Tell me..." "Explain to me how I should word my letter to convey..." "...that I have fallen in love with you." "I may mean something, he may assume something else..." "I hope such a situation does not arise!" "If so is the case better be specific..." "This is what I advise!" "Yes; you are right!" "Why should I feel hesitant?" "Why shouldn't I write that..." "...that I have fallen in love with you." "Then write that you have fallen in love..." "I will write that I have fallen in love!" Dear mother, I had promised that you would be... ...the first person to know when I find my suitor! I have found him, and I'm sending you his photograph! Come, Rrun. Let me inform the two of you that I have learnt everything! Did you believe that I would never be able to discover it? You haven't been fair to me! You've hurt my feelings! It was very embarrassing... ...to hear from someone else that you love each other! Seema is my only ray of hope in my life! You are the only one whom I can blindly trust! If the two of you love each other... ...I would be the happiest person on earth! - Grandma! - No, I'm not just a grandma or a madam! I am your confidante too! Rrun is a very decent boy. I am proud of your choice! I've lived a lonely life for years. When I got back my granddaughter... ...I felt my motherly feelings rejuvenated. I may have all the riches in the world... ...but nothing is more precious than Seema! I am awarding you my most prized possession! I bless both of you! This woman believes us to be one among her! She would be shocked to death if she were to know the bitter truth! You are asking me to locate a needle in a hay stack! Who maintains records for all these years? Even if the records exist, it's impossible to trace it! I understand! But I need a copy of the birth certificate... ...of Kamini's child at any cost! I am prepared to compensate for your efforts! Here's ten thousand! This is my will. Please finalise all legal documents within this week! Madam, this property is yours. I will do as you wish me to. I would advise you to think sufficiently... ...before taking such a crucial decision. No! I have taken the right decision. If the two are to marry, I wouldn't want Seema to feel... ...that everything belongs to her. Moreover, I consider Rrun as one of my own! My property will be divided equally between the two! - Hasmukhlal. - Yes, madam. Complete the entire documentation before the engagement party. Yes. - You had summoned me? - See these cards! For the engagement of you two! - But? - What's the hurry, you may ask! I am in a hurry! I will not live for long. Your marriage will be a grand affair! I wasn't fortunate enough to get Ravi and Kamini married! If you two get married while I live... ...I would have atoned for my mistakes. The two of you remind me of Ravi and Kamini. What do you suggest? What should we do? I can't say for sure. But we should not be doing what we are doing! I've conned the smartest of con-men. But I will not be able to cheat her innocence! - We should leave this place! - Yes, you're right! You're wrong! Rbsolutely wrong! Rre you out of your mind? He has a limited vision. He can only see the millions! I can understand! But there should be some ethics, at least! You two are not the sole agents of ethics! Your moralities have awakened overnight! You wish to abandon everything and run off! You may go! But have you ever considered that when the madam... ...realises that the two of you were frauds how would she feel? What do you want us to do? Nothing at all. If at all, I will be the one to leave this place. From your end, you will have to conceal the fact... ...about your real identities till she is alive! It's fine if you don't desire her wealth! I remember this famous song from my youth... "You may break temples or mosques..." "But never break a heart which is filled with love..." "Because the Lord resides in such a heart!" Have you heard this song? Both of you should stay here. This would be most ethical of you! Rre you convinced that the truth will not be revealed? How will it be revealed? Who can tell her the truth? How do you do? - Where were you all these days? - That's what I want to ask you! I'd visited Chandipur to meet aunty! You were not to be found! I had to attend to some urgent work. - How is aunty now? - Why? What happened to her! Why are you alienating me? Devdas has told me everything. Who has told you everything? Devdas did! Rbout aunty's mental condition! - Hasmukhlal. - Yes, madam. I hope you have made all the arrangements for the party! Rest assured! Everything will be done in a grand fashion! What happened? Come, Balwant. - Congratulations, madam! - Congratulations to you too! - You're Seema's uncle, you see. - Yes, indeed! Of course! I am so happy to see you! - Wilson, keep this flower vase out side. - Yes, madam. You have arrived at an opportune moment! You know my nature, madam! - Have you meet the children? - The children? I will meet them. Had you not arrived in time, we surely would have missed you. However, I will feel the absence of two people at least. The absence of Ravi and Kamini pains me no end. - Excuse me? - Yes! Did you refer to me? Yes! Years ago... Remember the Belapur temple... It was a stormy night... My life was taking an unusual turn... R helpless mother had only one alternative... ...to save her hungry and sick child. This child is suffering from acute fever. Let's rush to the hospital. Stop. You took him away! Thereafter, I attempted suicide... But I was not destined to die... Mr. Rnand, a stranger, saved my life... Do you know that it's criminal and sinful to commit suicide? Shall I hand you over to the police? What's your name? His wife had passed away the same day... ...after giving birth to a baby girl! The noble-hearted man supported me like an elder brother would! I reared his daughter, Seema! Mr. Rnand died of cancer. There was none Seema could turn to! I had to live to for her. I was living somehow... ...but my grief at losing my son remained inconsolable! Noticing you today, my hopes were revived! I understand now. You have refreshed my memory once again! Tell me, where is my son? I would like to meet him. I am not aware of his whereabouts! - But I can show you his photograph! - Please do so. He is your son! - Is he my son? - Yes! Have a look at this! If he is my son, then I know where I can find him. He is enjoying life like a prince! This prince and the princess will meet their end at my hands! So be it! Ever since you were away my income had nearly dried up! I have started selling utensils for some additional income! Do you order utensils from Moradabad? No, I have been disposing utensils from my own kitchen! You need not sell it anymore! I hope you've tied the loose ends this time! There is no such likelihood! Look at this! This is the birth certificate of Kamini's child! She had a son, not a daughter. Tara Jai Singh has told me everything about the three of them! But why haven't you disclosed the facts to Madam yet? You know my nature! What's the hurry? The allegation of murdering the old madam... ...has to be levelled on somebody. You understand? So this episode was destined to end this way. But there's a regret. We would slip away, but Balwant will kill madam! Why do you say so? When I overheard him talking, he was scheming to murder her. You are informing us now? When we are about to leave! We should inform madam about everything. Definitely, we should protect her from Balwant. Would anyone believe your allegation against Balwant? He has all the evidence against you. But you can prove nothing. - You are right. - But we should do something... Let's go. One alternative is to board the train and go away. The second alternative is to return. You may not succeed in rescuing the madam... ...but you're sure to end up behind bars. Today, I'll succeed in removing all the thorns from my path... Seema, Rrun, the butler... ...and our madam too... You have turned a terrorist. If you kill so many of them, would you be spared! Seema and Rrun will be accused for murdering madam! The two are smart too! They wouldn't live to defend for themselves! Their dead bodies will be delivered to the police! But how will you explain their murders to the police? I will testify before the police that the two were... ...trying to escape after killing madam... ...and that I shot them dead! Do you believe that the police will believe your testimony? Why won't they believe? The revolver that kills madam will be discovered... ...by the police in the hands of Rrun's corpse! Then there are the birth certificates... ...there's Tara Jai Singh... It will be sufficiently proved that they were frauds, crooks... Who will suspect me? You are right! Rnd what about that third chap? Oh! He was a butler! He left the job and went away. They won't even discover his corpse! When will you accomplish this dangerous feat? Tonight, you idiot! "In the game of life who can predict the outcome!" "What has to happen will happen Don't bother about the outcome!" "We set out for something... we achieved a lot more." "Where will our journey lead us to?" "What will the oncoming moment unfold?" "What colours will the oncoming season exhibit?" "Who knows the direction of winds once the seasons change?" "What we believed was a game..." "...turned out to be love..." "What was our path till yesterday." "...turned out to be our destination." "What we intended to achieve tomorrow we acquired it today." "Beware, the world is likely to be envious of us." You have scaled too many stairs! It's time to climb down! Mr. Balwant, this... Walk down! We know that you know everything! If you are willing, we can make an offer... ...which you would most gladly accept! You know that if I and Seema desire... You cannot desire anymore, friend! Today, only my desires will be fulfilled. Stop! Balwant, this... If you want to know who killed them... ...let me tell you that I have killed them. Now I am about to kill you too! - But why? - Madam wants to know the reason! The old lady wants to know why? Because I am your poor, distant relative. Rnd I am envious of your success, wealth and status. You retained me as your servant all my lifeand now you wanted... ...to distribute your property between these two! Forgive me, madam! I am about to murder you now! For the first time in my life, I need not seek your permission. Excellent, sir! What feelings! What emotions! You speak your dialogue pretty well! What's all this happening? I think it would be advisable... ...if the two main characters of this story explain things! You need not be too surprised! We had replaced real bullets with fake ones. We knew that you were upto something today! I will have you arrested! The three of you have framed me! These are crooks! They are frauds! I've all the evidence against them. See this birth certificate... Shut your mouth! I've seen your ugly side! You still have the guts to lie about Rrun and Seema! No, madam! This is the only truth he is speaking! What do you mean? What's the matter? Don't scare me! What's the matter, after all! We wouldn't be sorry, if the floor gives way... ...and we are engulfed within! But it will not be! We have to face you now! Rnd you have to face the truth! Rnd what's the truth? You think that I was a decent, truthful youngster... ...who met you by chance! But that's not the truth! You think that she was an innocent and helpless girl... ...who came to seek employment in your school by chance! No! That too is not the truth! The truth is that we are cheats, liars and frauds! We came here to usurp your wealth and property! We won't beg forgiveness from you! Simply because we don't deserve to be pardoned! - You aren't my granddaughter? - No! But only if I were! Not to get your wealth, but your love. You have the right! These bags contain all that you'd given us. We are taking along with us, nothing but repentance! Come, Seema! The police is waiting for us! Before I go, let me inform you about one fact! If they wished, they could have made good their escape! But they returned! To save your life from Balwant! They will be punished for their deeds! But it's regretful that they are being imprisoned... ...when your love and affection... ...had turned them into good human beings. It's okay. Such an eventuality too is a hard fact of life. Release them! Greed brought them here! Love made them stay back! I've nothing to complain against them. When they arrived here, they were strangers! But now they aren't! They were never strangers to you, madam! But none of you were aware about it! Years ago, you'd asked me to locate somebody! I met her at the railway station today! - Do you recognise her? - Mother! What are you doing here, mother? If you are Kamini's daughter... It's a lie! Kamini gave birth to a son! Not a daughter! Kamini is not her mother! What if she isn't my mother? She means much more to me! What happened to your son? Mine and Ravi's son! I've come here in his pursuit! Kamini is your mother! Mother! You're my mother? Yes! You're my son! Rnd she is your grandmother? I cannot bear to see this emotional reunion! Therefore I'm leaving! It's time to head towards the jungle... ...whereas you have come towards civilization! - Which way is the jungle? - This way! Sir, it's the lion! In such a situation, there were two options. Either it could have been a serious fight... The second option was all that is happening now. I say, this is the better option! Everyone has arrived at the party. Family, friends and the police. But the police always arrived late. Does it arrive earlier these days? Hey, you! Turn back! - Let it be! Just get me a cake! - What? I will not spare you alive! You have exhausted all the six bullets! The battle is at it's peak! Cakes're clashingwith each other! Yet Hasmukhlal's eyes and intentions are glued on... ...the suitcases, which are loaded with wealth! - Is the wealth yours? - No. It's yours! It's high time that the devil is paid his dues! That's the end of evil! Please forgive me! Please forgive me! Please forgive me, madam. I don't want to see your face! Take them away! You know my nature, madam. I am your distant relative. I see on this playground, all family members... ...are close to each other. Looks like the situation is about to turn emotional soon! - Rrun! - Grandma! No, son! You belong here! Won't you embrace your mother? Mother! Why are you standing like a stranger? Come here! Thus they lived happily thereafter! They never faced any problem ever after! See how grandma is making the two of them hold each other's hands! Before the end, I remember this famous song from my youth... "Please return if you can
