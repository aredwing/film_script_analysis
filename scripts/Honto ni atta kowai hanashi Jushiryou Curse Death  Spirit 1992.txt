But I did have one concern. That was... Then he... disappeared. No... A CURSED DOLL As experienced by Kaoru Kurokawa Starring Michiko Hada My story is about a doll. A doll? There's a doll in my house which is a bit strange. MAIKO KAWAKAMIKI Strange, how? l hadn't even known about the doll until it appeared in my dream. ScreenpIay by Hiroshi Takahashi Directed by Hideo Nakata The same dream, over and over. I was waIking down the corridor, then I heard the voice. Satomi! Satomi! Who is it? What? A doll... That was the cupboard where we keep old stuff. lt bothered me, so... I found the same doII I saw in my dream. Oh, no... Mum said we'd had it for ages. But she put it away such a long time ago, l couldn't have seen it. l thought it might appear in my dream again, if l put it back in storage. So... Satomi, the doll... What is it? Never mind. Sorry. Then? So l took it out and put it in the alcove... Satomi! Satomi! Did you just come up to my room? No. What's the matter? What is it, Satomi! Mum! What's that doll? What about it? What's wrong? ln the end... Mum didn't tell me anything. Do you still have the doll? We do... in our alcove. lt must have been my imagination. You have to burn the doll. What? lf you don't burn it... Satomi, behind you! Turn the light on! Quick! Don't do that... lt sounded real, Etsuko! About the doll... You should ask your mum. l will. Thanks. - See you then! - Bye. - See you! - Bye! Etsuko is being haunted by the doll! l'm sure she is! See you! I couIdn't forget what Etsuko said. Mum... Hello? Oh, Dad... what? - How did it... - Her taxi had an accident. Dad, go home and get some rest. l'll stay here tonight. Will you? Satomi... Satomi! Who is it? lt's me. Who are you? Don't you remember? Don't you remember me? Satomi? You've forgotten your sister? Take me home. Take me home. l was on the way to donate the doll to the temple. Why? Because... you're afraid of it. There's a temple for dolls. Mum... ls there anything odd about the doll? Anything odd? Did l have a sister? Wasn't this her doll? Why didn't you tell me? You were still a baby then. l didn't want you to worry about it. She gets lonely, and comes into my dreams. Someone died nearby, but we're still having a party... ..party... Let's take a break. Satomi, you've been acting strangely lately. Are you ill or something? No, not at all. l didn't want to say this... but if you can't play the part, just tell me so. No... l'm fine. Don't worry. Hey... Did you find out about the doll? What? Oh, that... lt's nothing. l don't care about that any more. No, don't look at me like that. Satomi... Satomi... Help! Oh, Satomi! What's happened? Where's the door, Mum? Satomi! What is it? Mum! Where's the door? Help! Satomi! You're dreaming. Satomi! Hey! - D... Dad... - Satomi... lt's almost... Satomi? Stop staring at me like that! ls there something behind me? Satomi, can l have a word with you? Sorry, but you have to give up the part. lt's too much for you at the moment. Do you understand? Who will take it over? Etsuko. l haven't told her yet, though. - Satomi... - You know it, don't you? - The role is yours. - Listen to me... l don't want to. Have you done something to the doll? Don't stay home on your own! lt may shock you, when l tell you this... ..but l keep seeing a traditional doll behind Satomi. Satomi had a sister who died in a fire. My husband rescued Satomi, who was only a baby then. But we couldn't find her sister. Then, from the fire... ..l heard the voice calling me. ''Mother! Mother!'' l went in the direction of the voice... ..then l saw a child. l grabbed her and ran out of the house. Mother! Mother! But... ..it was a doll. lt must have moved in the fire. So l'd mistaken it for my daughter. What is that doll? l don't know. lt's been in the house for ages. Etsuko, will you stay at our house tonight, please? My husband is away on business. l'm worried about her being all on her own. It's me. I'm nearby. Etsuko? Are you OK? Everything aIright? l'm fine. What is it, all of a sudden? Where are you now? Where? ln my room. Don't Ieave the room. I'm coming soon. Satomi? Satomi? Etsuko? Come, quick! Is there a window in your room? CIose it now! I'm coming soon! It's hot! HeIp me! Mother! Where are you? HeIp! It's hot! Where are you? Mother! HeIp me! Satomi! Satomi! Come on, Satomi! - Sister... - Satomi... Sister... Sister... - Where are you, Sister? - Satomi... Satomi... Pull yourself together! - Satomi! - Sister? Sister? Sister... Satomi, we have to hold a service for this doll. Dolls look human, but they don't have souls. Occasionally, an evil spirit enters the empty space inside them. It's hot! It's hot! Get me out of here! Get me out! Don't give in to the evil spirit! Get me out! We carefuIIy buried the doII's ashes in my sister's grave. - Emily? - Sister. - Are you crying? - No. What shall l say... it was wonderful. Such a beautiful face. Since then, I have feIt my sister's souI with me. FortunateIy, I got the Ieading roIe back and we had the opening night. I'm sure my sister is watching me from somewhere.

Why are you so selfish? Why do you keep making me worry? Give the ball back to Takuya. - Looks delicious, doesn't it? - l'll start! Hooray! - How is it? - Delicious. Really? Delicious? Let me see... l'll taste it as well. - How is it? - Great. Bon appetit! - lt's nice! - lt's good! Don't be stubborn. Alright. Mum, what's in this? - Chestnuts. - You're joking!

Don't talk nonsense. Or don't you understand unless it's Dad scolding you? Dad would have understood me! A notice about a missing person? l saw it, and got scared. That's why you were so tense. But... you came camping because of Yuta, didn't you? Yes... Then you should enjoy it together. Right? Let's drink. The beer is nice and cold. - Here you go. - Thanks. l was trying to play his father's role today. But look what l did... No wonder Yuta said such a thing. This must be a dream. A nightmare. Yuta...

But why... Yuta? She must have thought he was her son, and tried to take him away! lt's not... Yuta? Yuta? Yuta! Yuta! Yuta! Yuta! You are... mine... No one can take you away from me. Come... Come... Come... Stop it! Stop, please! Come... Come... Come... Dad... Darling... Yuta! Mum, it's Dad! That was Dad! He was watching over us. ReaIising that, I couIdn't stop my tears. - Mum, hurry up! - Have you got everything? - Give it back! - Wait! - See you later! - Have a nice day!

Why don't we change rooms? ln that case, take them to the Fuji Room. Yes, madam. Come this way, please. Where has Yukari gone? Camera... My video camera's missing. Didn't you leave it upstairs? There! Kyoko comes out of an unexpected place! Don't touch it without asking. Sorry... Nice shot! Yukari insisted on staying at the inn. She didn't come with us, in the end.
