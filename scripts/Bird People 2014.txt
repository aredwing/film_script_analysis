One new message. Sonia, it's me. I met the guy, they don't hire for those jobs. It's all outsourced now. 300... 300 and what? 321 or 327, I forget now. 300 and something, plus 370... call it 700. Okay. Cke and flight number, passenger's full name to check in. F9 for electronic ticket. F10 to validate. F4 for boarding pass. No, shit, bags before f4. '53 is The Cuban revolution. No, Batista's coup. - Sure? - Positive. Are you coming? Go on, come. Of course I'm angry! I commit to my commitments. Now he says he can't make it! It depends on the price and everything. No, I'm going home first. Fascinated by the world of beauty and well-Being? One rabbit or one and a half? No, one nice big rabbit is easier. One nice big rabbit... Two slices of bacon... sir, dear asshole, I received your final reminder to pay bill number xyz... Thurs OK, Fri no good As I wrote in my two previous letters... Shit, the wall's not straight! Alain? No, not Alain. Bertrand or something. It's crazy, I should remember. 407.50, tax included. 50 minutes twice a day, 100 minutes. 6 times a week... 600 minutes. 600 minutes is 10 times 60. 10 hours a week! Wow, 10 hours commuting each week. 40 hours a month... Achille, mind the gentleman. It's just about Aminata. And she isn't black? Yes, but she can use deodorant! What's up? Aminata got a warning. It's not that Aminata smells, But whether she smells nice or not. So who decides that? A warning for smelling bad? "Sloppy presentation". I have a problem with the girl you sent yesterday. She's fine for the common areas but too disorganized for the rooms. Can you find me someone fast? You know they arrive in an hour? Audrey... I need you. Can you do a replacement Sunday at the usual time? 7 days in a row is a lot But you can take a day off when you want, Monday even. Sorry, but I really can't Sunday. I have an exam Monday. I need to revise. All right. Gone back to uni? Hey, I'm not their slave. Hello. 822-To be done first Housekeeping. American? Yes. Where you come from? San Jose. San Francisco. Silicon valley. Oh! Bill gates. No... Yes. Bill gates. Paris. Beautiful. Mm. And phone up the environment agency. They'd love to hear from you. I've seen some over here. Oh! Whoa! Oh! Gary Newman. I'm Boris. Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you, too. - Your pass. - Thank you. Are you happy with your hotel? Happy? Yeah. Got a bed, air conditioning. Thrilled. What time's your flight tomorrow? 8 in the morning. You speak French? I understand a bit but don't speak well. No, that's very good. You don't understand, Mr Abelar. I don't want forecasts, I want certainties. The emissions must be managed 100%. Sorry, I wasn't clear. Our studies show the new module Makes the whole system compatible. As it was until Veloce changed the plans. They weren't changed but perfected. Why not from the outset? Bullshit! They're modifications! We all speak French, right? Hold on a second... I'll be clear. My problem is to deliver an operative plant to Dubai by December 31. After that date, penalties apply. Then my problem will become your problem. I won't let cogeted bear the costs Resulting from a fault in the design Or production. I won't have the Dubai project Go the same way as Sao Paulo. So, from the top... if c-Lab's hypothesis is confirmed... does it affect the whole plan? Yes. An additional module, however small, modifies the plans. How long do you need? Once it's approved, around 10 days. And you, Mr. Bayoud? I need the technical plans to do the schedule... "without the technical plans, I can't draw out the specifications. We'll have to stop... 8 to 10 weeks before computing can be installed. Then it depends on how fast Mr. Newman can work. It depends on Mr. Newman. I'm heading out there tomorrow to work With Mr. Bayoud's team. But this obviously means more Work to do in less time. I'll need to get two additional Programmers on it, which comes at a cost. Naturally. But can you finish by 31st of December? That's my concern. If our additional fees are less than the late fees, I'm sure we'll reach an agreement. No. The only thing I'm worried about Is spending Christmas in Dubai. Allo? Dad, I'm on the bus. Can you call back in 5 minutes? Okay. I can't hear you. I saw Thomas' mum the other day. Heard from him? Thomas? We're not at the same university. It's over anyhow, it's all history. Met someone else? Dad... what? Don't talk about that. Why not? I don't know... it's private. Surely I can ask if you're OK. You're not too lonely? No, the campus is full of students. How's the job at the hotel? Fine... where were you today? I was at university all day. What? I didn't hear that. The good thing with the hotel is you get to use your English. Who with? The guests. You chat to maids in a hotel? Now and then. Why are you so aggressive? I'm not aggressive, but you're being absurd! Everything OK, sir? I'm fine. A cigarette? Oh... Yes. Thank you. If you need anything, medication or whatever... I'm right here. Thank you. I don't know what's happening. A little anxiety, I guess. I don't know the word in French. We call it "Angoisse." Yes... unusual for me. But I feel better now. Later, Gary Newman would be unable to pinpoint The moment when he made his decision. Was it really a decision? Could one speak of choice when the idea, once sprouted, Had imposed itself on him as being obvious? Over the following hours, Gary continued to review The consequences of his impending deed. But nothing made him change his mind. On the contrary As the hours passed, he was increasingly convinced There was no other solution. Good morning, this is your 5:30 wake-Up call. Then, in spite of his tiredness, He decided to wait until 8 o'clock. The precise departure time of the plane he wasn't on. Yes. Thank you. Gary woke at around 4 in the afternoon From a sleep troubled by bad dreams. After downing some coffee and half an omelette, He realized that his flight to Dubai was about to land. It was after 5 in Paris, Just past 7 in Dubai. Welcome to Dubai international airport. Please use the touch screen to help you navigate. Island inc. Good morning. Hold on. I'll try and locate him for you. Gary suddenly felt like he'd thrown out a hook And was waiting for a bite. Hello? Gary? It's Katlyn. Where are you? Still in Paris, near the airport. Is Allan there? No, he's in a meeting at H.P., Till 10:00, I think. I'll have him call you. So, what happened? Did you miss the plane? Listen, I can't really go Into it right now. It's complicated. What am I supposed to do about Dubai? They just called. Isn't the meeting tomorrow morning? Tell them I got in an accident... in a taxi, on my way back from the Paris meeting. Tell them I'm at the hospital. Make up a broken arm or something. And try and get George on the next available flight To replace me. Well, technically you can't do Anything until I've spoken to Allan, But book a flight if you can. Are you okay? I mean, you didn't really have An accident or anything like that? No. No. Everything's fine. Don't worry. What should I tell the others? Nothing yet. Allan's your boss now. Check with him. That's your best move. Okay. I'll handle everything and get back to you. Take care of yourself, Gary. Hi, don. Gary Newman here. Listen, could you call me back? It's pretty urgent. I'm in Paris. The time here is 6:15 P.M. I'll talk to you soon. Gary, what's the deal with Dubai? I didn't go, Allan. I didn't get on the plane. I'm letting it go. You're letting what go? Work, the company, everything. I'm done. What? I'll work out the details With McCullan. He'll send you my resignation as soon as possible. Let's try and do this quick. - Okay? - I can't hear you, man. What did he say? Did you manage to find a backup plan for Dubai? Can George go? Gary, listen to me. You cannot not go to Dubai. Do I have to remind you how much this contract Is worth? I know. I'm sorry. I wish this would have hit me At a better time. You wish what would have you hit you, for fuck's sake? The decision to stop everything. Allan, I won't change my mind. Better... Gary? Hello? Hello? Well, hold on. Hold on. Hold... Hey, Gary. Gary, I am not trying to get you to change your mind. I mean, I never argue with my clients about Any of their reasons for doing whatever it is they fucking do. But you're sitting on a bombshell here. Resigning without notice on a business trip Is an abandonment Of professional responsibility. If Allan or Dennis decide to sue, We have no chance of winning, zero, zip, nada. And I don't even want to think about the damages. There's no need for dramatics, don. What? I said there's no need for dramatics. Allan would never sue me. Yeah, well, that's not the impression I got From his message. Anyway, he's not alone. Has Dennis called yet? No. But there's no damage done. Someone familiar with the contract will take over for me. Simple as that. Well, the trouble is, Gary, I'm in New York for the day. I don't have time to put out these fires. I'm get Kopinsky on it, all right? Why don't you call the office And give him the deets and... And... And we'll just figure What we face here. There's something else I need to... Hang on. Just a sec. Hello? Gary, it's... It's me. It's Allan. Allan, one second. Oh, Jesus. Don, I'm sorry. I have to go. Gary, do not fuck up with Allan. Don't commit to anything. Nothing in writing, okay? No e-Mails, no text mes... Nothing. I'll call you when I can. Gary... what is going on with you? Would you please explain it To me? I've had enough, I think. That's all. Yeah? Th-That's a bit of a short answer, Don't you think? You do realize the shit we're in because of you? George can handle it. Yeah, well, fuck George! I'm not talking about Dubai here. I'm talking island inc. You can't just quit, Gary. It's out of the question. Not with the Stuttgart signing Just two weeks away. God damn it, you know all this! I know, Allan. What do you want me to say? Everything. I want you to tell me everything. Why are you doing this? Why now, of all times? I mean, you can't just quit like This, Gary, all right? I mean, not without at least Giving me some notice. When... When did you make This decision? Yesterday. Yesterday? Do you mean to tell me... Honestly, Gary, this... It's bullshit! You can't just quit out of the blue. No, I disagree. I actually thought about it a lot last night, and I think It's the only possible way to do it. What the hell are you talking about? I'm leaving everything Behind, Allan. I told you. I'm not coming back. Not coming back meaning...? I'm staying here in Europe. For how long? I have no fucking idea. What difference does it make? What's going on, Gary, huh? Did something happen? No. I just can't do it anymore. I don't want to go on like this. What do you mean, "like this?" Everything... The stress, The job, Elisabeth. Come on, Gary. Something must have triggered This insane decision. What was it, huh? W-W-Was it Matt's death? What? No. Of course not. Look, um, if it's the stress, You can... I don't know... Um, Stop the business trips, Take some time off. I'm serious. You can take a few months off, if you like. Just don't do this. Jesus, I can't be the only one Saying this. What does Elisabeth say? I don't know. Wait. You haven't told her? No. I'm calling her later. Wait. Wait. Gary... when you say that you're leaving Everything behind, that you're not coming back... are you leaving Elisabeth, too? Yes. Everything means everything. My god. Have you thought about her? - A-And the kids? - Of course I have. They're all I've fucking thought about. Who do you think I am? Listen... Talk to Elisabeth. Discuss it with her. And then call me in the morning, After you've slept on it, okay? If you want, but it won't Change anything. You staying on at the Hilton? I'm not going anywhere. Okay. All right. I'll call you. Where are you flying, ma'am? To Singapore. Oh. Nice. Thank you. Camel or Marlboro light? Marlboro light. 3 packs, please. Here you are. Your room number, please? Yeah, don? Gary, I just spoke to Kopinsky. What's this about the stock? You really want to sell your shares of island inc.? Yeah. I thought it over. I'd rather, uh, take care of everything now. Hey, remind me... You're part Of the blocking minority with Allan? Yes... Me, Allan, and Dennis. Then we are saved. What? I'll just need to call Kaufman. Actually, I don't even need to call him. - It's enough to mention his name. - Hang on. I don't want Kaufman getting his hands on anything. I'm with you there, Gary. I'm talking from a purely Tactical standpoint. No lawsuit, no Kaufman. All square and even. You never stop, do you? Where are you? JFK. Heading back to San Francisco. Listen, don, do whatever's Best, but I don't want you threatening Allan with Kaufman While you're representing me. Are you there? Can you hear me? Yeah, yeah, I hear you. I'm on the case. I'll let you know. Have you finished, sir? Yes. Thank you. Say it again. - What? - What you just said. You heard me. I would like to hear it again. Elisabeth, it's over. No, that is not what you said. - Stop it. - "Stop it?" You say, "I'm not coming back," Or some bullshit like that, And I'm the one that suppose to stop? Please repeat what you just said. I'm not asking for the moon Here, unless you're not even Sure yourself. But I am sure, absolutely. Then say it again, damn it! - Say it. - Stop barking orders. It's unbearable. You're leaving with her. Is that it? Who? Your girl. I don't know what her name is. Your whore. What are you talking about? I fooled around with her twice. That was three years ago. Is there someone else? No. There's no one. What do you mean, "no one?" You're leaving by yourself? Yes. When I first met you, You couldn't even eat a meal by yourself. Yeah, well, that was 18 years ago. I guess I've changed. It can happen, you know. Sometimes people change. Is... is this because of the fight we had before you left? Elisabeth, we are way beyond that. Pretty much all we do anymore is fight. I don't know what would be left between us If it weren't for the fights. That's a horrible thing to say. Don't look at me like that. It can't all be gone... just like that. It's awful. I feel like... It's like... Why didn't you come to me about this sooner? Why can't we ever just talk a little m... A little more what? We haven't talked for years now. For years now, every time I say Anything about myself or my work Or our relationship, you take it the wrong way. And every time you say something, I feel like you're attacking me. If we could talk to each other... Don't tell me that. Don't tell me this isn't directed against me. You know damn well it is. No. I'm doing this for me. Can you understand that? For just once in your life, just once, Can you understand I'm doing something for myself? Oh, okay. You're doing this... You're doing this for you. You wake up one day, And you decide to do something for yourself. Well, that's great. That's wonderful. Only... Oops... The thing that You're doing happens to be Destroying my life. What... You don't see there's a cause-And-Effect thing going On here? What, that's too much for me to ask, For you to acknowledge that Your actions have consequences? We should stop this, Elisabeth. It's pointless. Sure. It's pointless. Whenever it's about your responsibilities, It's pointless. That's not the issue here. Well, what is the issue?! Go ahead. Say it! I don't think my leaving you is going to destroy your life. I think it's hard, brutal, Insulting, painful, whatever the fuck you want, But I don't think for a second it'll destroy you. I think that's just something You're telling yourself so you can comfortably Play the part of the victim. Well, fine. Go ahead. Wrap yourself up in it. If that's what you think, You're right. We should quit talking. You have absolutely no way of knowing how I feel. It's pretty outrageous of you to accuse me Of playing the victim When you're the one who's always complaining About your life. Poor Gary... Too much work, too much stress, Too many business trips. He doesn't even have the guts to talk about our relationship. Why won't you just admit that You're leaving me because you can't stand me anymore? Yes. That's a part of it. Then say it. God damn it. Have the courage to say what You feel for once! Okay, I'll say it! I'm leaving because I can't take My life anymore... My work life And my life with you. I can't take this permanent State of war anymore! I can't... I can't take you anymore. See? This is directed against me. The garage called. Your car will be ready tomorrow. What should I do? I don't need two cars. Do what you ever you want. Maybe you could sell it or... do what you want. What about your mail? The bills? McCullan will take care of that. Don't worry about the bills. He'll take care of everything. Oh. I forgot. Mr. Peacock said he's retiring Next year. He came to prune the Ro... Roses this morning. Oh, Gary... we don't need all these things. We don't need a gardener. If that's the problem, we can change. - You could quit working. - Beth... We can just live off my salary and sell the house. Beth... Look, we can change everything if we put our minds to it. You said it yourself. People can change. Beth... it's too late. I'm exhausted, Elisabeth. It's very early here. What am I gonna tell the children? I have to tell them something. What am I gonna say to them? I don't know. Tell them the truth. Even if it's hard. The truth? What truth? I'm not sure I understand myself. Just tell them we can't do it anymore. I can't keep living my life like this. I feel like... a lump of sugar dissolving at the bottom of a cup. That's it? "Your father won't be coming Home because... Because he thinks he's dissolving like a lump of sugar." Yes. What are you dreaming about? - What? - What were you dreaming about? I don't really know. There's a party tomorrow. Want to come? Whose party? Some student you don't know. I only just met him. Working tomorrow? No way. Part-Time means part-Time. Maybe. I'll see after work. What? You say that but I bet you won't come. Why wouldn't I? I didn't get that. Was it in his safe or not? No idea. Check with reception. But wait. With the Tokyo flight late, it's chaos there. OK, I'm on it. Three, four, five, six... ...Fourteen, fifteen, sixteen. Sixteen! Shit, sixteen. Housekeeping. Yes? I know it's you. What? At the hotel? No, I'm at home. I mean, in the hallway. I did some shopping before leaving. In Hamburg? But how... Silly... what time do you arrive? Want me to meet your flight Or shall I wait in the room? Me too. It's raining inside me. I'm wet just thinking of you. See you later. You have to leave the door open. Can you do an extra hour? I don't know. See Mrs. Baccar about it. She isn't here this afternoon. I have someone off sick. I'm at my wits' end. Okay. You're saving my life. Do 891 and suite 79 at the end of the building. Do it last, we don't need it today. No need to overdo it. You'll never finish otherwise. Bitch! I shouldn't make the bed? 817-Departing Housekeeping. Everything OK, sir? There's someone in 817. What? It says "departing" but the guest's here, asleep. Where are you? Hold on, I'll ask. Audrey? Oui? You're right about 817. Reception forgot to note a last-Minute change. Okay. Do the room anyway. The guest said he'll be going out in an hour. Mm. Service. Isn't it the 18th today? Yes, he should be in Dubai. Housekeeping! OK, I'm sick of this now. Shit... is someone there? What's going on? What the hell is this? It's wild! What do I do now? Wow. Ah! Right... Since when? 3 weeks now. It's driving me crazy. Cripes! I work here till 3 am then get up at 8 to visit flats. It's hopeless. Even with a steady job? The trouble is, I was subletting before. And no one can vouch for me. Where do you sleep? On a friend's couch. Half my stuff is in his garage, half at a pal's in Rouen. It's a mess. Can't you stay at your new girlfriend's? No, we're not there yet. She doesn't know. Why haven't you told her? We just met. I can't tell her I don't have a place. It's awkward. Where do you see each other? How do you manage to... we don't for now. But that's OK. There's no... I'll find something. I will. Gotta get back. Do I know you? What? That sparrow... it was staring at us. What sparrow? It's gone now. Back to work. Ciao. This works really well! Right... Let's practice now. Follow the line. And off we go! Right turn... Up we go... And we land! OK, the wind's the toughest part. Quoi?

Is that him? The sleeping man? Everyone's gone berserk, Running around like rabbits with their heads cut off. Chickens. What? Chickens with their heads cut off. Chickens. That's right. And what do rabbits do? Rabbits just fuck. You dummy. It's impossible to have a serious conversation with you. You remember when we used to go fishing with grandpa? When you with grandpa. What? Oh, my god, you're right. I was alone. "Girls talk too much, Gary." Well, why do you ask? I don't know. You think they've got rivers Here like in Montana? I would imagine, yes. Maybe over by Spain. Right. I think I'll head that way Tomorrow, toward the Pyrenees. Gary, are you sure you're not too depressed? I'd really hate that. No, quite the opposite, actually. It's strange. Ever since I decided to stop, Everything seems more... even the light seems more Beautiful, I swear. I don't know why, but it's getting to me. You'll call regularly, won't you? I'd like it if you'd call me Kind of regularly. I promise I will. Sue, are you there? I'm here. I thought we got cut off. Okay, I'll let you go now. I'll call you soon. And don't worry about me.
