Plus it reminds me of that. That's what you're going for right? You want people to feel like they are really right up in there? Nose pressed up against the glass. Life's like a snow globe. You gotta shake it up to see the snow. Yoo hoo! How did you get there? Let me see it. Come on. Give it a shake. Look at that! It's so shiny. It's glitter. Hmm. That's not what you see.

Where do you want to go? Oh, it's not the question of the day. No the question of the day is, Do you want help to find you way? Yes I do. But I also do not want you to tell my Ted. I mean, my husband. Alrighty. If you follow this path. Cut through there and basically you're downtown. Sounds good. Thank you. Hey. Yes? You realize you are sitting on a fortune here right? What do you mean? Well this. This is what everybody wants. The dream of wonderland. You have any idea how hard I work every year to capture this exact feeling? At the pageant? Exactly. That's right. The pageant. Anyway, I'm just saying. Do something with it. Make a fortune. The forest is the heart of the town. As long as there's a pulse in my chest that will never happen. Found you. I guess you did. And now we're back in civilization. Adjacent. Wow. What? These majors are exquisite. They're all hand painted. Just like your grandpa use to make right? That's right. Don't look at me like that. Like what? Like I don't know you. Alright. You may not know me but believe you missy, I've been to the circus and seen the show. The whole show? All three rings. Alright. What street does my mom live on? I'm not playing this game. What game? I'm not playing quiz kid Ted. Why now? If you did you could prove to me that you're real. Except if I'm a figment of your imagination, wouldn't I know everything you know? So me telling you wouldn't prove anything. It's a fallacy. An Argument from innocence. What does that mean? - Oh you don't know what that means? - No. That's because in college I took debate and you didn't. Which means I know something you don't. Which is impossible. Unless... I'm real. Woooo! See that right there? That's my real dance. That's nice. Let me do. Let me do let me finish it off. Let me finish it off. Work it out. Alright I'm good. Ok point Ted. Alright. Yes. Looser buys lunch. I don't have any money. Check your back pocket. Go on. Oh what the? What the? That's because we share a wallet. Yeah. My wife hates purses. That was your brain. Brain blowing. I got it. I blew your mind you get it? - I get it. Yeah mind blown. - Ok. Just saying. You got amnesia. And here's your extra large rice pudding. Yay! And your pancakes. Oh Oh. This is all so amazing. I'll be back with your griddled cheese and your BLT. Mmm extra B. Extra B. I remember. Thank you. You do realize I'm humoring you right now? Hey buddy you opened pandora's box with that eggnog. What's the deal with that clock over there? Every time I look at it it says 2:59. It's right twice a day. The weird thing is that that's the exact time I had my accident. I'm just waiting for you to try the rice pudding. Mmm. It's really really good. You know that very rice pudding was your favorite food when you were pregnat with Teddy Jr. You couldn't get enough of it. You use to send me at all hours of the night to get that for you. You remember? Sorry I don't remember. Nope I do not. So... I just want to be super clear ok? I don't remember anything about our married life together. And I will never remember anything about our married life together because we don't have, in fact we never had a married life together. So all these adorable little reminds and... perfect may I add reminds. It's just not working. OK. I too want to be perfectly clear. Umm... You are my wife. And you're the mother of our children. And every time you say you're not it's like a dagger through my heart. So whatever it is you got going on you gotta figure it out because I'm almost out of perfect. And I'm serious. If you have to pretend but... Don't do more damage then what you already have. Oh shoot. That man is looking for his car. Which is all the way out in bumplefudge. That's my Eric! Your Eric. Eric! Aah! Megan! You didn't go to Vegas. No? Eric if you are in on all of this I have taken it in, and I've found my ability to forgive but mostly I am so happy to see you. Well I would be happy to see my car. I think someone stole it. Oh that was your car? No no I took it. You stole my car? Well I borrowed it. But Eric listen to me I, I respect your intentions but I am filled with gratitude that we are both stuck here together in this crazy town. Well I'm stuck here cause you stole my car. It must have been a heck of a concussion. Eric please tell me you remember our life together? Honey? Ted. Hey. I expect you to make this car thing right. Absolutely. All the free firewood you want. You two know each other? You know I rather have your house. My offer still stands. Like I said, It's not for sale Mayor. Mayor? Eric the Mayor? Yes and unfortunately I have a city counsel meeting to get to. I guess I have to walk. Sorry about that. See you two at the festival committee meeting huh. Really sorry about that. We'll get your car back to you. He didn't even wave. Huh? What? He didn't wave goodbye. Ok I'll be right there! Honey I gotta pay the tab that we ran out on. Please don't- Oh no! You've gone crazy again. Don't go crazy. Don't cry first of all. Don't cry. Second don't steal anything. Third, try not to act crazy. Well, I guess i might as well just give up. Unless. Wait she said everything I need is right here. That's what she meant. Hmm? Ted, what did Eric just say about doing a festival meeting? Yeah, we do the pageant every year. Oh! That is the perfect opportunity to work on our relationship. Absolutely baby. It will be just like College. Red and Ginger all over again. Yeah that's - that's right. Show tune Ted. More like Show tune Ted. He's got shows tunes he's go... I get the point. - Alright. - Thank You. Meg. Honey we are gonna run the show from the top ok? Ok I'll be right there, I'm just gonna grab an eggnog. Nog it up like I do. Ok. Hello. Mayor Eric. Megan. There we go. Alright so gonna draw straws and that's how we'll hand out parts ok? So everybody grab a straw. I just stopped by to tell you that we just don't have wiggle room for the costumes this year. But you can sow right? Uh yeah you bet. Christmas is not for the elves. What does that even mean? Oh, You know just that it's the elves job to make Christmas special for everyone else. There just not enough money in the budget. There is never enough money. Um Eric? Um you know I've been thinking about some ideas of how the town could make some money. Oh yeah? uh huh. Go on. I means If this were the city you could put up all these contradicting conflicting street signs and then give out a whole bunch of parking tickets. You know what, that is actually a good Idea. Yeah? Well I'm full of good ideas for how the town can raise funds. Oh yeah? Like what? How about the woods? I mean they're beautiful but they're just so big. You can certainly develop part of them. Like a country club. Yeah exactly! Maybe some ski lifts. parking lots. Power. Water. You'd have to bulldoze about half. Maybe 3/4 of it. Well that might be a little ambitious. You know, I have to admit. I am seeing you through completely new eyes right now. Oh yeah? We should talk over lunch about your ideas. Action. There is no room in this inn. Very good. What? Huh? Nothing. If you have something to say you should go up there and say it. Go for yours. Really? - Go for yours. - Alright. Talent! I was just kidding but ok. I have an idea. Starting tomorrow we're gonna change things up a bit. No more picking actors by drawn straws. We are gonna do actual auditions. I would like all of you to come in tomorrow morning having prepared 2 paged dramatic monologues. Um, what is a monologue? Google it. No Google? No. Library? Alright library it. Come ready to dance. I like that you are changing things up a little bit. Thank you. You know what I really like? What's that? The dance. Give me some. Oh oh! Hello! Somebody's got her mojo back. I yes. - Yeah! - I do. Back in college we use to shake it on the dance floor. Don't there's kids aund. Shake itrom behind. Ok kids here. That's right. Let's get some work done. They know how they go here don't they? I don't know. So when are we gonna get a tree? Not today. We have a show to rewrite. But it's almost Christmas. Well. Meg. Ted. Hey. Mr. Blevin. Have you seen our new trees? Just got them in.

I auditioned for a play and they told me, and I quote "You have the worst singing voice I've ever heard in my whole life". Where they wrong? No they were not wrong. I sound like a dying cow. I was like Woooo woooo I'm not even exaggerating.. So what did you do? Well... I became the story teller. I became the one who decides where the story goes. Ok. I've got an idea. Allow me to introduce you to our new assistant producer. Congratulations sweetie. Thanks! I'm not gonna even let my kid audition next year. It's demoralizing. Why are you always trying to upstage me?

What do you think is more likely. That you're a mom. Married to a boring husband... No you're not boring. You are the furthest- Living in a town where the only excitement that happens is for a few days during Christmas were you direct a pageant that is actually more fun the worst it is? Or some self fulfilled fantasy where you actually produce Christmas movies instead of watching them in front of a fire, drinking eggnog. I get it. I get what you were trying to tell me. And I didn't want to hear it but... You know what you were right. You were right Meg. You are not the woman I married. If you were looking for a way out, you found it. Ted. Hey Ted. Ted. Hey. I was uh-I was really pulling for you there sweetheart. I can fix this. I know I can. It's really coming down out here. Yeah. That's the thing about a snow globe.

But then the Ye Olde Hot Chocolate Shop wanted the cover! So now they're in a bidding war! Oh. I better go see how high they've gone. Gentlemen, where are we at? You must be so proud. It's like a fun house mirror. You. smaller. And prettier. I am teaching her. She is learning- She is learning to control and manipulate to get what she wants. You say that like it's a bad thing. Meg? I can't act this way. Right is not a good angle for me. And Meg, won't it be... I don't know. Relatable to just have a little baby bump. I'm glad you are making the most of the opportunity. You're still stuck. Like a beached whale. What? Screw you dream food. Come on. Where's Teddy? Where is my Joseph? Mia! He locked himself in his dressing room and he won't come out. What? Ugh. Actors. Teddy, come out of there right now. Teddy? Teddy's missing. Take 10. Come on Mia! Teddy! Teddy! Teddy! Teddy. Hey what's going on? Hey have you seen Teddy? He ran away from rehearsal? You lost your own son? Wow! Wow! How long ago? That's my fault? Where were you? Where was I? I thought you had everything under control. You know with the mayor... I was about to tell the mayor were... TEDDY! Teddy! I'm over here. Junior! I'm over here! Teddy! Are you ok? I was so worried about you. Don't you ever do that again. Do you understand me? Don't do that again! Yes Dad. Alright. Sweetheart. Don't cry mommy. I'm sorry. Oh no I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. Do you want me to sing for you? I like singing. Ok let's get you home. I'll be right there ok? The tree. It's really something. I found the ornaments. Oh yay! Whoa. We got that one the day Mia was born. Babe are you alright? Yeah. Here's the one with my handprint. Wow. I am sure you were practically perfect in every way. I'm so sorry I missed it. Mom. Where the star for the top of the Christmas tree? I don't know. Help me look for it. Oh here it is. Ok. Now that one right there. That one belong to my mama. And her mom's before her. Wow. Hey! Hey! What's this? It's an eviction notice. I own all the woods. Including your house. Their set to be demolished and sold on Christmas day. Should have sold it to me when you had the chance Ted. You can't do this. It's already done. Wait! Ted Ted Ted! Ted Ted! Calm down. Calm down. Uh huh. I'm sorry about this Ted. It's a real shame. There's an emergency town hall meeting in an hour. They'll have all the paperwork for your perusal. See ya in an hour. This meeting is called to order. Business at hand is the change in title of plot 89. Also known, erroneously, i might add, As "Landover Wood". That's impossible. Sam Barnes would never allow it. I don't believe it. It's not possible. The forest is the heart of this town. It's the simple. Un adorned truth. I'm selling the forest. It's just not the same here anymore. You all... must have noticed it yourselves. This town use to be a place for neighborly folk. But these are mean and various times. And who am I, to stand in the way of what people want. Sam, is there anything we could do to change your mind? I'm sorry. It might have been a moment of weakness. But there's simply no going back. Eric this was you, wasn't it? I put the investors together. But this is your town. How could you do this? Well it was your idea. It was a great one at that. No. Thank you Meg. That's - That's... That's... Tell me he's lying. Ted he misunderstood the... Tell me destroying our home and everything we love wasn't your idea. Tell me this right now. Ted he misunderstood me. I had an idea about saving the town but that's... Ted! Ted? I just want you to know I didn't decide any of this. I didn't ask for any of it. It just happened. You were right Meg. You're not my wife. Is it Christmas yet? Not quite. I'm just waiting up for the jolly man. You go back to sleep. When you wake up you can open your gifts, ok? ok. I love you. I love you too. Can I ask you something? Sure. What do you want to ask? When you're gone will mommy come back? I sure hope so. I know daddy wants you to act more like mommy. But I hope mommy acts more like you. I love you mama Mia. Yep. You know you're suppose to ride off into the sunset, not the sunrise, right? I'll add that to the list of things I know nothing about. Ok. Help me up. Oh! That looks good. They all look the same to me. No no No. It's in the legs. You do it one way you get angel robes. You do it another way and you get tail feathers. It's a matter of nuance. You care if I walk with you? Knock yourself out. Figured I'd escort you out of town. Just like that huh? Just like that. It's getting colder. I warned you. And everything you did just hurt that boy. Looks like you managed to cancel Christmas after all. Stop. I thought you wanted perfect. But it's not. It's perfectly imperfect. Meg! So what am I suppose to do? It's simple. You just have to want it... with all your heart. The bridge will do the rest. Hey Sal? Please tell me he's going to be ok. What? Nothing. Are you angry at me? I'm not angry. I'm just disappointed. Now get. Hey you know what they say about a stopped clock? W.W.M.O.D. I have no idea what that means. It means I'm going to fix this. Hi, um... Is Eric, Mr. Mayor here? Really? Yes. I-I... Yeah? Hey. Hey. I have a proposition. I thought you weren't interested. A financial proposition. I'm waiting. Ok. So your plan is to log the forest, sell the timber, and then sell the land back for twice what you paid for it? Sounds about right. Ok perfect. What if I told you that I can get the town to raise the same exact about of money and you won't have to do a thing? I think you are watching a few too many movies, zuzu. That is impossible. Mom! I knew you'd come back. Well as they say, the show must go on. I'm sorry I just always wanted to say that. Ok. Listen... I've been all over this town today. And I think that we can use the pageant to raise the money we need. Eric has agreed to give us back the land if we could match his buyers price, so... The people of the town would own the forest. Exactly. And at the same time it would belong to nobody. You know it's crazy enough it just might work. Look, help me fix this, ok? And once it's over I'll go. I just couldn't leave you like this. Hey if it doesn't work at least let me give you this. Before the business and the property lines, the infighting ruins it all forever. One last Christmas. The whole town... all together. Oh and Ted, we're gonna go back to the original script. Your script. Tell everyone, anyone who wants a part can have one. Really? Yep. From one dying cow to another. Yay! Hurry come on! We have to go! You guys get started. I'll met you guys there, ok? Yeah. I just have one thing I have to do. Wow. I'm getting kisses now? Ok. I know you were in there. I'm sorry. Hi. Help you? You're Santa. No. Yep. I think... You're looking for someone else. And frankly, just like you I've heard enough. Please, this town needs a Santa. I actually... Haven't improved any since my audition. But I have. Please? Listen, if you won't do it for yourself, please do it for this town. You're just too late. I'm almost done. How do I look? You look beautiful. You're gonna do great. Both of you. Ok you're on. Go. Silent Night Holy Night All is calm all is bright Round yon virgin, mother and child Holy infant so tender and mild Sleep in heavenly peace Sleep in heavenly peace Good job. You did great. Thank you. That's very kind. We don't have a Santa to end the show. Excuse me? Could you be our replacement Santa? The costume is right there. Wait. What are we gonna do? We gotta fill. Follow me. Ok. Ladies and gentleman please enjoy this next treat from our directors Ted and Meg! Hey everybody. Uh huh. - What? -Come on you go it. - What? Hey! Come here. Do the lift. Ok! Ready? Whoa! Santa! You're on. Santa! Hey! A merry Christmas to all. And to all a good night. OkI would like to thank you so much being here tonight. I know that I really deserve to ask for your anything. But I'm hoping that between all of us we were able to give enough to save the forest. Sorry everyone. We didn't do it. Oh you forgot one. Uh I have a donation. Old man Barnes? Everyone deserves a second chance. Even this old town. We did it! Give her the gift. Mia, why don't you give her the gift. It's from all of us. Awe! Oh wow!

Is that ok? You told me to get whatever I most wanted, so I... You take them! They're yours! Merry Christmas! Go bring your family and have a great time. Really? Mmhm! But what about Frank?

It's like she's watching over us. Perfect. Wow! What was that for? Aww I saw the mistletoe you put up... What mistletoe are you talking about babe? I didn't put any mistletoe up. Just shut up and kiss me. Finally. Now it's perfect.
