Police found evidence of gambling activities including large sums of cash, gambling equipment, and... large quantities of drugs including Ecstasy and amphetamines. The gambling den was the largest in the area and is believed to have been in operation for over 3 years. The Taiwanese owner who denied the charges was taken into police custody. It's raining so I can't drive fast. Don't blame the rain. You're always late. The stuff is almost finished. Shut up! You banged my car up badly but I didn't say anything. Hey! Quick! Shit! Damn fool! Hey! Por! Hey! What's up? Chet mad at you? Yeah! A little bit. You deserve it. You crashed his car. Be nice to him, OK? No! If I am, he'll think I like him. Shit! Take over will ya. I'm going for a smoke. OK Hey, Pop! Your sitting pretty. You're rich, huh? If I were rich, I wouldn't be talking to you! Shit! You stole my stuff. Bitch! Stole what? Your mother's panties? Stole my mother's panties? Bitch! You wanna mess with me? Come here. Come here. Wanna play games huh? Bitch! Cm'on! Get lost, yeah go. Get in! Gees, where did she go to smoke? Bitch! Where you going? Come here. Wanna try it? Come on! Cm'on. Let me go, let go, let go! Shit! How come so much stuff got me so little money? I told you I don't know. I sold 3 tablets for 1 Baht I sold 3 tablets for 1 Baht. That's all Why don't you ask your pusher? What the hell? If my man hadn't screwed up, I'd have you. Bitch! Stupid broad. You want a piece of me? Bitch! Come here! Porawee... Porawee... Porawee... Porawee... Porawee... Porawee. My name is Rudee. You're my patient. A fisherman found you unconscious in the water so he brought you here I'm not sure how long you stopped breathing but I see nothing wrong except some lacerations. Don't worry, your baby is safe. Baby? You're 10 weeks pregnant. Didn't you know? I'm alright now. Can I go home? I have no money to pay. Let's talk about it later I want you to stay overnight for observation. The drugs you're taking may affect your baby. Are you still taking them? No! Alright the nurse will take you to your room. You must take medication and rest a lot. Sukanya, take her to her room. Yes I can't stand young girls nowadays. They dress horribly and have bad manners. You're lucky the swamp is close to the hospital and the deputy director was on duty last night. You're very lucky. She knew you were pregnant so she admitted you. She probably feels sorry for your baby. Who asked you? Excuse me. Please wait. Who's helping you? Prateep? Yeah! Is this the deputy director's patient? Yeah, bad girl. Here's your bed. Where's my stuff? In the cabinet next to your bed. Help! Are you OK? Help! Miss... Miss... are you OK? Miss! Miss! Miss... Miss... are you OK? Miss! Miss! I told you I didn't take the drugs. Why don't you believe me? Damn it! I don't care. Yeah, I believe you. There's no trace of drugs in your urine. The flood that you told me about was probably a hallucination brought on by nearly drowning and the temporary lack of oxygen to the brain. But what worries me is what you're going to do. Although you're OK now, you could have a relapse. These drugs may have side affects for the baby. Though you don't care about yourself you should care about your baby. Did you report this to the police? Sukanya, bring me the dead patient's file I'll take a look at it. The hospital will have to report this incident to the drug rehabilitation center. An officer may come to investigate. But I won't report it to the police. Well, I'll keep these drugs. It's OK, right? I'll go in a minute. Sukanya, take her to her room I'll go myself. You want a drink? Let me do it. OK Giving me the sweepstakes? No, thanks. Where's the doctor? She has an urgent case to attend to What do you want? You can't help me anyway I'm here for an abortion. Can you do it? If not, tell me where the doctor is. She's in the forensic room. Go find her yourself. What's that room? Delivery room, maybe. Porawee Who are you? My name is Pipat I am an officer from the drug rehabilitation center. Where's the other guy? I'm replacing Dusit who used to take care of you. You haven't contacted the center for a long time. Let me remind you of the rules. Rule number one, after a four-month treatment you must report to the center or your officer every 2 weeks. Rule number two, you must... Test my piss to see if it's yellow or purple every month, right? I've heard it a hundred times. You're an energetic new comer. Let's find somewhere to talk I must take your photo and record your voice... to make a behaviour report for the center. Tell me your name. Por Your current address. Apartment Your working address. Baby Boom. Since leaving the rehab center have you ever taken any drugs? No I know from the hospital that you were injured. Was it related to your drug habit? How long have you been working? Where's the other guy? Hey! You haven't answered my question yet? What's up? You're back on it, aren't you? I'll go find the doctor. Doctor Give me her file and inform Doctor Rudee. How is she? I don't know. She may be nervous because of the drugs. A crying baby! Did you hear? There's nobody here. Can't you sleep or are you sick? I thought I heard something. Go back and get some sleep. Did you hear about Sia Chieng's casino? It got busted last week. Of course. It's big news. Hey! You said your stuff is good but why did he get busted? My stuff is good! What I sold him was crap. The real stuff is here man! Por! Come here you bitch! I checked with all my girls. None of them dared cheat me except you. You remember this? Hey! What are you doing? Shut the hell up or you'll get it. You alright? Por, I'm leaving Thailand next month. My friend in Australia needs a guitar man. He asked me to go. Don't wait for me because I may not come back. You can find a new boyfriend. Nurse! Nurse! There's a ghost in that room. There's a ghost in that room. It's following me. There's a ghost in that room. What's up? There's a ghost in that room. Calm down. Calm down. Take it easy. There's nothing. I'll go with you. See? There's no ghost I can't believe you're afraid of ghosts. What are you doing? Sukanya told me that you want an abortion. Come here I'll clean your wound. No! If you really think of doing it you'll regret it I'll show you something. This is the sound of your heart. This is the sound of another small heart. See? You have a heart and so does the baby. You may want to get rid of it today but one day when you really touch it believe me, you'll change your mind. You'll do everything to save its life to stay with it as long as possible. Here's my eldest daughter. This was her when she was the same age as you. She had just graduated and was going to be a doctor like me. But two weeks after this, she was in a car crash. She died with her father before reaching the hospital. It's ridiculous that I who save a lot of people's lives... couldn't save my own daughter's life. It's very late now. You should go to bed. - I'll go with you I don't want to stay here any longer. Is there something you want to tell me? You wouldn't believe me anyway I don't want to stay here. I want to go home. But you must promise me that you'll come whenever you're called. If you promise, I'll let you go home. And promise that you won't hurt your baby again I promise. You've been gone for days I thought you were dead! Por! Por! Hey! Going to work? Yeah! I'll send the car back to Chet. How have you been? If you're not well yet, I can stay with you. Don't worry. I'm OK. Go to work I'll stay anywhere except that haunted hospital. In all hospitals people die everyday. It wouldn't be strange if there were ghosts. But a girl like you, afraid of ghosts, that's really strange! You're not me. You'll never know. It's damn scary. It followed me everywhere. Yeah? That's why I'm seeing someone sitting next to you. Stop it, Gift! Excuse me. Excuse me. Por? Are you sleeping? Not yet. What's up? Hey! Who's behind you? Shit! Stop! - I'm kidding. A man named Pat wants to see you. He wants you to sign some documents. He's persistent. Is he still with you? Yeah, I'll go get him. If he wants to come, let him come I'll go get him. Hey! You're better now so wash the clothes in the basin for me will ya. Hey! Damn! Hey! Come in. Come in please. Sit down and wait for a while I'll call her for you. Por... hey! Are you shitting? Por! Por! Por! Hey! Help! Take her to the hospital please! Is it because of the drugs? I must test her blood to see if she took it or not. We'll know tomorrow morning. Will you stay with her? You can stay in this room but don't disturb her I'll go now. Thank you doctor I'll video tape her to record her symptoms. Yeah! So we'll know what's making her sick. Por! Por! Where will you go? Por! Where will you go! Hey... Por! Are you alright? I'm OK. Por! Por! Mister! Mister! Where are you? Damned ghost! Why the hell do you haunt me? What did I do to you? Come here! Come here! I'm not afraid of you. Do you come out when it's wet? I'm in the rain now. Come to me. Do you hear me? Come out now. Come out! Don't haunt me again. Damned ghost! The woman in the swamp comes to find her baby. Your friend may be her go-between because she also has a baby. She'll go when she gets what she wants. Hey! You took her child, right? Give it back to her. Where's my child I saw you in the swamp. A black Mercedes Benz. Give me my child, please. Why? How is Ord related to you? Tell me. Give me my child. A dead woman's baby. How are you related to Ord? You took her child. Give it back to her. Give it back to her. You took it, right? Give it back to her. Give it back to her. No! No! Por! Por! Are you OK? Por has never got mad like this before. What's wrong with her? Did she really see the ghost? Well, you can go back now I'll take care of her. Hey! Don't you want her to sign the document? Never mind. I must send the report to the center. If they don't accept it, I'll come back again. This had better be good! I don't like getting up early! The spirit has left the swamp. She came to take her child back. She came to me. Who? Come out and talk to me. Who's following who? What the hell are you talking about? All of us must die. It's haunted that woman. She knows everything. You're not making sense, dumb bastard! That girl of yours. She knows everything. She knows about the swamp the abortion. And she knows that you are involved. Just shut the hell up. Don't do anything. I'll take care of it. How are you? You're OK, right? No answer. Are you possessed? Or are you on drugs? Don't take too much. Did you bring me the document to sign? No! What are you thinking about? I wonder if I can be a mother. Well, I heard that you're going home again, right? Yes I'll go abroad for one week I'll be back next week. Come to hear the blood test result I don't think there's anything to worry about. If you don't love yourself, love your child. A mother must do everything for her child. What will you do at home? I'll find out who Mai is. Do you still believe in ghosts? Don't think about it. There may be nothing at all I can't just wait for strange things to happen to me. Don't worry about dead people. Take care of the new born. Don't think about the past. Yes I'll come to get the test result. Goodbye Do you know who and where she is? Where do we begin? I don't know but I can't wait in fear. Shit! If you don't want to help I'll do it myself I'll help you for sure I thought you were delirious because of the drugs. But now I believe you. Why? Never mind. Where do we start? Where did you first see her? Nong Luang Swamp. Did she live around there? Nong Luang Swamp. A very pregnant woman I have a friend who may be able to help us. The corpse's face was badly eaten by fish. We can't do anything. The postmortem result shows that... she committed suicide. We guessed that... she jumped into the water because of her pregnancy. Are you sure it was the case at that swamp? Yes! It was big news two years ago. Why are you interested in it? I'll tell you later. Why was it big news? Just a woman committing suicide. People seriously protested against the autopsy. They said she was a ghost, who died with a baby in her womb so they decided to take out the fetus. Umm... the baby's corpse has disappeared. Where was it? People said it was stillborn. What's the name of that woman? Sopida. Her nickname is Mai. She was an orphan and stayed with her cousin. She was due to graduate when she became pregnant. What's going on? Hey! The case was two years ago. If you want to know more, research old news articles I don't know about the postmortem result I'll send it to you if I find it. Thanks a lot. Hello. Are you Mai's grand parents? Yeah... Yeah. We are Mai's friends. What do you want? I hadn't contacted her for a long time I've just found out she's dead. How long ago did she die? About 2 years. Let's talk at our home. Do you have to operate on the corpse? Yeah, sure! Or it'll haunt us forever. Let him do it. Otherwise they'll haunt us relentlessly. Don't do anything. They were dead anyhow. The baby must be taken out before the cremation. If its spirit runs amok, we'll be in trouble. Let's do it for the majority. Hey! Hey! It's that girl. How are you? Mai suffered badly from morning sickness, like you. Mai was pitiful. When she was alive, she was an orphan. When she died, her baby was stolen. Her corpse hasn't been cremated yet. Was the fetus stolen? Yeah. The corpse was taken out in the evening and the fetus had disappeared by the morning. At first we thought that the undertaker took it but we had no evidence. That night he was killed in his home. It was rumored that he took it so Mai killed him. It's bad that people believed such nonsense. Where did Mai take these pictures? At the college. Mai didn't have many close friends there. Do you know who this man is? Do you know? I don't know. If you really want to know, go ask at the college I saw this man in my dream. Excuse me. Where can I find this teacher? Teacher Tanit. He's upstairs. Can you take me there? Teacher... there's someone coming to see you. - I don't know. OK. I'll leave now I used to teach her when I had newly graduated. She was polite. Do you know anything, or anyone who might know... about her death or about her boyfriend or... anyone who was related to her? Tanit I don't know. I have to go now. We've got nothing again. Never mind. We did our best. Ord, How did you get in here? How do you know about that night? Which night? It was two years ago. How the hell did you see it? Did you know that pregnant woman? What the hell are you talking about? Hey, shit, damn you! Let me go, let me go, let go of me! You know too much. You're gonna die. Bastard! You die! You die! Hey... hey! Ghost! Ghost! Help! Don't come! Don't come! Don't come! Help! Hey! No! No! Don't come! Don't come! Don't come! Excuse me. Do you know him? No, I don't. But people say he sold drugs to teenagers. What time did you come back last night? On the night of the 21 st August, Bundit Ngerntae. Umm... about 2 AM a safety foundation officer who was known as Ord K... committed suicide. The police stated that he was under the influence of drugs. Before jumping to his death he shouted that a ghost would kill him. A witness told reporters that Ord had forced his way... into Miss Porawee's room and injured her. In a fit of rage ran and jumped from the 4th floor to his death. Mai, I really don't know how to help you. Pat? It's me I know where to find the child. Let's go together. Go find another entrance, OK? This must be Mai's child. How can we be sure? Go ask that assistant? I've been here since it was recovered by police I hear a child crying every night. The owner of this place believes that the child will help him get richer. If he believes it and does only good things, it's OK. But he's greedy so it's a mess. Did you come here for the ghost or the human? No! No! Don't kill me! Don't come! I'm scared. Help! Help! It'll kill me! I'm scared! Take me away from here. Lock me up but just take me away from here. How was Ord K related to this case? How was Ord K related to this case? How do you know him? Ord was an undertaker. He brought corpses to the hospital so I knew him. He told me that a Taiwanese businessman... wanted a Thai infant ghost to be used in his casino. He believed that an infant ghost would bring him luck and wealth. Especially the item that had been blessed... going through a proper ritual, it will be more expensive. The more potent, the better. How was it related to the woman at the swamp? That woman didn't commit suicide. One day someone who I owed a favor asked me to help her son who had murdered a woman I hired Ord to take away the corpse. The corpse was sent to the hospital in the morning... for the autopsy. She died with an infant in the womb. Me and Ord wanted the infant so we followed the corpse to the temple. The undertaker agreed to take out the infant but he asked for too much money so Ord killed him. So you took it for Mr. Chieng. Yes, but the one that Mr. Chieng got was only an infant's corpse I had suppressed its soul at the forehead's skin and hung it around my neck. But that woman broke it so its mother's spirit came back to take revenge on me. This is not a common suicide case. We must re-open it because there're many concerned people especially Tanit who is a murder suspect. The case of Miss Sopida Chantaramanee a pregnant woman who committed suicide 2 years ago was re-opened after the discovery of important evidence which changes it to a murder case. The hospital officer said that he was haunted by a ghost so he confessed all to the police. At present, the police continue to investigate it. There are two suspects, Mr Bundit Ngerntae alias Ord K the drug dealer who died the other night and Mr Tanit Chobchuen, a young teacher at a famous college who was suspected of having had an affair with his student. Did you hear about the lost student? No. What happened? She was pregnant I told you there's no use. Why do you keep it? Why do you talk like that? I know you don't care. So I'll bring it up myself I told you to get rid of it from the start. Why didn't you believe me? I have nothing left. I have no future. The child is the only thing I have. What can I do? I already have a family. I'm sorry. If I die you may be more comfortable, right? Hey! She's not dead yet. Hey! Quick! Mai, I'm sorry. By the time you read this letter, I might not be alive I'm sorry for what I have done I felt guilty about that woman for the whole two years I'm sorry. Please tell my child that I love him so much. Take good care of him and please tell my mother I'm sorry. Love. Mai is a good mother I hope you go to heaven. It's all over now. Hello Pat? It's Por I called to let you know that I'll be over soon. OK. Where are you now? At the hospital. I come for the blood test result. Today is a holiday. Will they be working? The doctor may be. She made an appointment. Listen to what the doctor says. She has good intentions. She may teach me how to feed the baby. Good. Let her take care of you. Are you listening to me? No! See you I almost forget that... the police sent this document to you the other day. Thanks a lot. There has been a case of suicide in a famous college. The dead man, Mr. Tanit Chobchuen was a young teacher who was linked to the death of the student named Miss Sopida two years ago. The deceased was suspected of the young girl's murder and was under investigation by the police I'm glad that you decided to keep the baby because the best thing in a woman's life is to be a mother to give birth and raise a child. What about my blood test result? You can tell me frankly. Nothing... just thin blood I'll give you some iron tablets. When my son was young he got a blood disease. He was often sick and weak but I did everything I could to help him and he grew up and graduated abroad and was successful. When my daughter died, my son was all I had left. No matter how, no matter what it takes I must look after him. But you! You came in and brought it up again. And made him died. You like these drugs so much, right? So have you taken them all? You like it? You feel exhausted? You'll be paralyzed for a while. What happened? Doctor! Doctor! Are you all right? I'm fine. I'm OK. Do you want someone to help? No! There's nobody left. Help me put her on the wheelchair. What's this, doctor? After killing you, I'll take care of that nurse I'll make them think that you killed her I warned you not to cause any trouble but you didn't believe me I tried to keep it a secret for two years I made it look like a suicide so no one would link it to my son. But you! You damn well destroyed it all. You ruined everything. You destroyed my son, my life and you're ruining your own life too I'll take you to the roof deck for some fresh air before you jump. You 'll do it yourself. I'll do nothing. You take the drugs and jump down. Don't be afraid. It's not gonna hurt not as much as I got hurt. Not half as much as I still hurt. Come here. Now you know pain. You can't escape any longer. Forgive me for cutting up your corpse. Nobody must doubt me I'll make your corpse very beautiful. Let me go! No! Let go! Why have you come here? I'm not afraid of you. You also destroyed my son I won't let you be reborn again. Nurse! Call the police now. During my life I never knew the true meaning of the word mother. Doctor Rudee was right that whenever a woman touches that little heart she'll do everything to protect it. So far I still haven't learnt how to be a good mother. But I know that I'll live a good life for him I thought you were delirious because of the drug. But I believe you now. Why? The woman in the swamp comes to find her baby. Your friend may be her go-between. She'll go when she gets what she wants
