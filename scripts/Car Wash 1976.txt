Money don't buy you love, honey, but it gets you the best low-calorie substitute. We'll be right back after this station identification. Peace, Lonnie. How you be? - All right. - l heard that. Good morning. Here's Billy Bass with the news. ln Washington, a new scandal, as investigators probe rumors of male congressional aides being hired in exchange for sexual favors. This'll never do. Gay activist spokesman Harry Twig applauded the alleged violation after an extended filibuster in a special caucus. A southern committee member said he had no objection to homosexuals, as long as they stayed in their place ... You don't know what you have to do with Lonnie. - You're crazy. Just shut up, DK? - Don't tell me to shut up! You shut up! Hey Dtis, is Mona here? She's late as usual, T.C. All right! Today we got the big three. - Yeah? Yeah.

Look out, Mr. Clean! - Now hear this: l believe it's exactly 2 minutes, 11 seconds to opening. Thanks. Keep the change. You've probably noticed, l ain't got nothing against you people. l ain't got nothing against no people. We need more love in the world. l don't know about marriage. l believe in the lunch counter thing. lf a guy wants something to eat, he oughta be able to get it. Come on, move it! What is this, an economy run? What's going on? Bastards! Move it! You're probably wonderin' why l even picked you up. A lotta guys are scared of getting ripped off or losing fares. A KGYS public health announcement: Cancer cures smoking! Watch it, my son's here today. - Dkay. l used to drive a gypsy cab in New York. Know what a gypsy cab is? lt'll go to Harlem, to Puerto Rican neighborhoods. We used to have a slogan ... Kind of funny, now that l'm with Yellow Cabs: ''We will go anywhere, we are not yellow.'' Get it? Not yellow. That's no slur on the Chinese. But l ain't afraid, because l trust people. l trust 'em, 'cause l like 'em. Come on, you bastard! l could tell that you was honest. l could tell by your eyes. Well, not the eyes, actually. But l go by body language. You got a real honest body. You bastard! ... record run in the women's 100 yard dash ... bettered Wilma Rudolph's Dlympic record by 0.5 seconds. And in baseball, Reggie Jackson hit 2 consecutive home runs in one inning, to aid in the 16-1 slaughter of his former teammates. That's what l call swinging a big bat!

Black blonde. Scruggy, what's the matter? You should be feelin' great. Look, l'm worried about Charlene. Maybe l should call her. l never stayed out all night before. lt's not cool to let a woman take you for granted. Besides, you was terrific! That's not all: l got a burn down there. Suppose l caught something. This isn't funny. Suppose l got the clap. How will l explain that? You ain't caught nothin' but a bad case of the guilts! - Guilt burn?

Dig it, l would be the first! l wouldn't be no square sucker, l'd be sharp, sharp, sharp. l'd have me a bad, black cape, man, and a helmet, two big eyes ... You full o' shit! - Come on, Lloyd, like wow, l'd just be able to walk up buildings, brother, and nobody would mess with me. Nobody, 'cause l'd be the Fly. You're still full o' shit. You wouldn't talk to me like that if l was the Fly. - Dh yes l would! Because then you'd be full o' fly shit. You know what? Ain't nothin' lower! Not kangaroo shit, elephant shit or chickenshit.
