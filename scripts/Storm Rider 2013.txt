Well, don't get too confident. Dad, it's called being the best, not being over-confident. - I want a horse too. - Oh! No. You know it's nearly four. I know what time it is. Excuse me. Yeah? No, I told you that account's in the Caymans. Daddy? Yes. What's Dad mad at? Well, I don't know. Probably something work related. He and mom have been fighting. They kinda fight all the time. They'll figure it out. Didn't with your mom. Hi! Hi, Brooke. Want some popcorn? No, thanks, Jordan. You know, my answer hasn't changed. But you know we'll pay you a price. I'm not selling Admiral. You can probably find a better horse. Maybe you're right. Yeah. Maybe it'll sprout wings too. George, George listen to me. Ok that's why you're in a six-figure retainer. No, I don't care. No! Just get me a continuance. No. Are you telling me that you can't just buy me a couple of days? ... And I need a new lawyer. No, you figure it out! Hey, here you go. You know you should ask for the horse, for your birthday. You think I'm good enough? Well, you're my little brother, aren't you? Half brother. Got this in town for you. Oh, yeah. What is it? Cookies. Chocolate chip. Oh, my favorite. Hey, we're not half anything. You're my younger brother, we're family. Got it? - Okay. - Okay. I'm gonna go tell Mom about the horse. Okay. You'd better hurry! (Or) I'm gonna eat your sandwich! Hey Mom, I know what I want for my... Where are you going? Where are we going? We're leaving. I packed your suitcase. It's upstairs in your room. Go get it and bring it downstairs. What? Go get it right now. We're leaving and we're not coming back. There you are. We're going. You're not going anywhere. You're on the board. Not anymore. I had my lawyer divest me of any and all holdings and positions in the company. - When did you do...? - I am not going down with you, Mitch! Now, I know you have money stashed offshore and I want my share. Even if I did stash money overseas, you wouldn't see a dime! Jordan will. What are you doing for money now? I sold my stocks and bonds and I closed the house account. And I sold some jewelry too. And that's gonna last you a week. Yah, at least I have a week. Where are they going? Who cares? Careful! What you got in here? Blocks? You mean like the ones in your head. Go. How come I have to go with you? Don't argue. Where are you guys going? Away. Wait, I forgot my hat. Well then it must not have been very important. Go. You don't seem understand, we're in a hurry. But I forgot my hat! Oh, we'll get you another one. Just go. You know, the captain goes down with the ship but the crew saves itself. Jordan! Jordan! Jordan, wait! Wait, I got your hat! So, how much will you lose? Everything, including Admiral. Is there something we could do? I can't even make change for a parking meter right now. They froze all my assets. I could buy Admiral from you. With what? I have money saved up. And I could pay you... Admiral's 200,000 dollars. They're gonna seize him along with everything else. I'm so sorry. What's gonna happen to you? I only know what's gonna happen to you. Me? I've made arrangements with Sam. You're gonna stay with him. Uncle Sam? No! Dad, I can take care of... Sweetheart, you're minor. Okay? You stay with Sam, or they're gonna put you through a court-appointed foster care system and I'm not gonna let that happen. I know how hard this must be. He'll have a good home. I promise. We're not half-anything. I've made arrangements with Sam. You are gonna stay with him. I'm so sorry. So how's the gelding? Good. I still owe you for him, right? It's okay. Well, I'll pay. I'm not poor, you know? I know that. I told you not to worry about it. Gotta go. I got a guest to pick up. Guest? You have a guest? Hey, don't say it like that. I could have a guest. Well, first time for everything I guess. Dani Fielding? Who wants to know? The sheriff sent me. He said Dr. Sam had an emergency call, so... I'm sorry, I'm Kevin Winslow. I can grab these if you like. I can get them. You sure? Yes, I'm sure. Alright, suit yourself. Wow. You are a really good whistler. I am? Well, thanks. Do you know my uncle? Dr. Sam? Yeah. Everyone knows him. Do you like him? Well, yeah. Don't you? I don't know. I only met him once when I was six. Has he ever treated you for anything? For what? Hoof and mouth disease? Get in. Wait, what? You know your uncle's a vet? Right? Don't know. Diesel! What's up buddy? What's up Diesel? Who's a good boy? You need some help? Diesel, huh? Yeah. A good name, huh? Yeah, for a tractor. All right. I'm taking off. Okay. Thanks for the ride. Don't mention it. Hello? Hello? Uncle Sam? Is anybody home? Apparently he thinks garbage takes itself out. Diesel, huh? You wanna help me clean? Smart dog. It's a disaster. Really. It doesn't even feel like I'm on Earth. I miss you too. Oh here I am. I have to go... You made it okay? Sorry, I didn't hear you come in. The door was open. Extra bedroom this way. Are you sure you can find it? I cleaned up the bed, it was kinda covered up. Oh. I think you oughta found it. You know, I got chores. So I'll let you get settled down. That is much better. - They gave me... - Oh, Jesus! Sorry. (I) Guess you're not used to having people around. No, no I'm not. You hungry? Um... Maybe we could go out to eat. You like chilli? Yeah, I guess. Don't you know? I like it, okay? I don't know what to do with the stuff in the bedroom, so I just threw them in the living room. I hope that's okay. I don't want you (to) rearrange my house. I won't know how to find anything. How do you find anything now? I have certain piles I put certain things in. (I) can't afford a maid like some. We didn't have a maid, but we didn't live like animals either. Don't you like animals? Oh, I love animals, I just don't wanna live like one. You're kinda for yourself, ain't you? I'm what? You live in a dump. Yeah, well nobody's ever complained before. Oh yeah, like who'd complain? Diesel? Are you gonna eat or argue? So, do you know about daddy's problems? Nope. Don't you have an opinion? He goes his way, I go mine. What? Did you get into a fight or something? Hey, look, We had a disagreement. I told him long time ago that I didn't agree with his financial schemes and his "minerakina dogamamie" sense He doesn't have schemes, okay? He's an honest man. Is that why he's in trouble with the government? It's a misunderstanding. He'll get it cleared up. All right. Well, hope he does. And then you can go home. You know what? Maybe I'll just leave right now. You can't right now. Oh, yeah. Why not? Well, because it's gonna get dark soon and... How are you gonna find your way? Fine. I'm not hungry. What'd I say? You can't leave right now, it's dark outside. I'll find my way just fine. Daddy wanted me to give this to you. And here are some cookies, if you want 'em. Chocolate chip. (I) guess I made it seem like it was her fault, didn't I? You don't have to always agree with me. What do you think? Peace offering? I'm not apologizing, I'm just being nice. Good morning. I made you breakfast. Thanks for the present. Yeah well. It wasn't much. I don't eat meat. I'm a vegetarian. Well, I'm a Sagittarian. Here you go, Diesel. Zucchini is a vegetables. Well, do you have any French dressing? Nope. Salsa? No. Do you have any condiments? Ketchup. Really? Those were really good. - Sam. - Jody. - Well, this must be Dani. - Hi. Hi, Jody Peterson. Oh Sam, you must be the worst cook in the state. Her first day here and all you give her is zucchini? Oh, I didn't know there's a menu requirement. You've been alone way too long. I'm not alone. Am I, Diesel? Here, honey. Have one of these. Mmm, excellent. What? You didn't feed her last night, neither? Well, she didn't want any. Didn't want any what? Your six-year-old chilli? What's wrong with chilli? You know, for a horse doctor, you don't have much horse sense. You know, I wasn't feeding horses. In here, Sam, I brought you some pay for the house call you made the other day. You don't owe me anything. I told you that already. What is it with women, anyway? Well... It takes some getting use to. Yeah, I figured it out. He's never had to care about anybody else 'cause there's never been anybody else around here. 'specially not a young one like yourself. You know, that's just something from Mars to him. Hmm. I thought this was Mars. You just hold your ground. You let that old rooster care about somebody else for a change. He told me that you're some sort of a champion show rider. I am. I had a thoroughbred. His name was Admiral. Oh. You had to give him up? I'd to give up everything. Hey! Why don't you come with me? You need to clean up that pigsty. Oh yeah, I'll get around to it. When? 4th of July? Wasn't thinking that soon. You know, she's been through a lot. You know what, that ain't my fault. Well, she needs somebody who loves and cares about her. I do that, just not at the same time. Hi! - Hey. - Hey. Come here. I brought something for you. Oh, he's adorable! He's small, but he'll grow. Oh hi, little guy. And I want you to have him. Me? Yeah, it's... you know, like a welcome present. A mule? Yeah, it's a perfect place for him now we already got one jackass around here. He's had rough time. Why, what happened? Big storm up in Cedar Briggs. His mum was killed by wolves. That much little guy huddled in the Cedars the next day. Well, it's the first time he hasn't bitten anybody who got close to him. Not everybody's like you. So what're you gonna name him? Stormy. That's a good choice. Well, it was really nice meeting you. You're gonna fit in just fine around here. Yeah, that's what I'm afraid of. So you gonna train him? Stormy? I don't think you can train a mule. Well you can't, but you can outsmart him. Outsmart him? My back screen door squeaks. Every time, I open it, cats come running. Lucky you. Well, they know that I'm bringing them food scraps. Cats can't be trained either, but these are... based on the screen door opening. (You) think I could train Stormy like that? Sure. If you work hard enough, you can get any animal (to) respond to you. Look, I gotta go and bags have to went to a horse this morning. I'll be back in the afternoon. Look... I'm sorry about your dad. I hope he gets things worked out. Thanks. Of course a zebra can't change its stripes. (I) forgot something in the house. I'll be right back. That's all right. How are you doing? Okay. You? I'm good. I heard you got a mule. Yeah. They're not worth much, you know? Well, that's what my dad always says. Okay, I'm ready to go. Sweet. Hi. You're pretty cute. Okay. You're okay. You're fine. You're okay. Shh. Hey. Just taste it. Come on. Hello? Dad! When are you gonna... Yeah, but Dad, I really need a new phone. I can't even call... Yeah, I'll go... He's right here. It's Dad. I figured I'd hear from you. Doing some training? Sort of. Not really much else to do around here. You like corn bread? Oh, I adore corn bread. Lah, so does Sam, but he'll never admit it. Because he never says anything nice. Oh, he tries, sometimes. No, he doesn't. So, you wish he would, don't you? (You) should just tell him. He doesn't get that kinda thing. Has Kevin been around? Ah yeah, a little bit. He's cute, huh? I think he thinks he's cute, don't know if I do. Yeah well... He's got a girlfriend, but I think he likes you. Oh, I highly doubt that. Well, he asked about you the other day. Yah, just so he would know when to avoid me. No, it was more than that. I've seen that look before. You're welcome, Sam. I know. Thanks. I gotta run. Do you like Jody? Well, I like everybody. No, I mean, do you like Jody? What? Mm hmm. Well, she sure likes you. No, she doesn't. She just likes having a cheap vet. - You get those chores done? - Yes, I did them. - All of them? - All of them. Well. Who's this? Wicked witch of the West. What's she doing here? Hey! Jordan! Hey you! Uncle Sam, this is Jordan. Hey, Jordan. Nice to meet you. Got something I wanna show you. Have fun. Yeah. It's Sam, right? Yeah. I'm Vanessa Fielding. We spoke once. Oh! What'd we say? So this is Stormy. Cool. Hi, bud. Why can't all we just be together? It's complicated. Mom's a complication, huh? Have you talked with your brother recently? Yeah, a couple of days ago. Did he tell you he's run out of money? Well, he's in jail, so it's kinda hard to get to an ATM. No, I mean he stopped paying child support. Huh, and you came all the way out here just to tell me that? Look, are you able to help with Mitch's obligations or not? I have been, I got Dani. No, I mean his other obligation. Your nephew. You know, he asked me to look after Dani. Never mentioned anything else. I know Mitch has cash stored in some offshore accounts. You know that for a fact, do you? Oh yes, 'cause I know Mitch. Maybe we could help each other out here. Couldn't you just be my guardian? I wish I could Bud. It's okay. You're not that far away. Staying with Aunt Mildred's awful. She's even worse than mom. I doubt that. Trust me. What does she want now? Come on. Well, we just got here. And now we're leaving. Get in. She's a nice lady. Yeah, tell me about it. But don't let it get to you, okay? It's not her, it's Jordan. She doesn't care about him. Maybe we can do something about that. - So, when they gonna need a booster? - In a year. Here you go, Sam. Thank you. Oh, that's too much. Oh Sam, you saved War Cloud from pneumonia, should be more. It's not necessary. Ah, Sam. Look, if you won't do it for my horses then why don't you put it away for raising a teenager. I know what that costs. What's that? It's a poster of the regional horse show that's coming up. I'll take instead. No Sam, take 'em both. No, poster will do. Good day. See you. All right. He's different. What do you mean? I don't know. Always doing stuff for everybody but himself. The kind of different we can use more of, don't you think? Come on. Having fun? Yeah, a blast. Why don't you try a couple of rocks. And do what? Beat it to death? Oh. Learned to improvise. Savvy? I... found this. Hey! Didn't see your truck pull in. He's riding pretty good. Yeah, he's doing really good. Would you like to come over to our house some time and ride our horses? Your throughbreeds? Yeah. You know, I think I'm gonna stay here and work more with Stormy. There's a dance coming up in a few weeks, Western Stomp. Would you like to go? With me? I thought you had a girlfriend. Who told you that? A friend. I've had one. What happened? She didn't want me to see other people. Other people? I don't know, people. I don't know, I don't really like country music very much. I'll bring ear muffs. Okay. What should I wear? It's up to you. Okay, I'll see you there. All right. See ya. So what are you planning on doing with her? It's a him. Doesn't anybody here know the difference? Yeah, well, I used to. I don't know what I'm planning on doing with him. It'll be something. Jody come around today? Maybe. You know, if you were a little nicer to her, she might come around a little more often. What's that suppose to mean? Nothing. You know what, you're like... What? - Summer storm. - A summer storm? Yeah. You rumble a long time before you finally get where you're going. Well... I'm gonna take a ride up in the mountains. Let Jody know, if she comes by. Oh what...? So Jody is coming? Maybe. Yeah, she's a summer storm, alright. Diesel, why don't you go with her. Get a little exercise. That's what I figured. I knew you were smart. That's my boy. Let's go. Come on. Stormy, no! Stormy, come back! Hey, old dog. You miss me? Nah! So you got any muffins? Oh, plenty. So where are they? At home, which is where you're gonna have to go if you wanna get some. What? Now? Well, I thought I'd have you and Dani over for supper on Sunday. Well, you don't have to... ask the girl. Why is he saddled? Dani took him out a couple of hours ago. You know where she went? Asked only where she was going. All right. Come on. Come on. You know where she went. Let's go. - Yeah. - Get on. Do you know where she is. - Stop bossing. - Just go. Stormy! Stormy! Here she is. What happened? Four wheeler on steroids came by. Spooked him, huh? Like you wouldn't believe. Thanks for the lift. Are you walking back? Oh, I know how. You know what, I think that I wanna drive back and check on Stormy. Huh? - Good idea. - It is? Hey, would you like to come for dinner on Sunday night? Yeah, we'd would love to. Well, now we're on foot. Well, you were gonna walk with her any way. Yeah, I wanted to impress her. What am I? Chopped liver? Close. Here. Oh, you don't have to pay me to walk with you. It's for her. Oh. You want me to walk with her? No! She's gonna some dance with that Winslow kid. - What's his name? - Kevin. Yeah, him. I just... I wanna, you know, to buy her something nice to wear. (I) thought you could help with that. Sure. Thank you. You're welcome. What are you having? Well, what do you mean? For dinner. Oh. Yeah. Hey, more pie? No, have to stuff it in my pockets. - It was so good. - Right. Hey, I'm going to the city tomorrow, do a little shopping. Would you like to come? No, too busy of a day for me. Not you. Could we maybe go to the prison? I'd like to see my dad and visit him if I could. Yeah, sure. Okay. Here, I can get these. Thanks. You realize that's.... you know, it's an hour south of the city to get there. So we'll leave early. It's okay. Hi, dad. Hey. I wish you hadn't come. Why? I mean, it's just far. You're wasting your time. How is it with Sam? Well, it takes some getting used to. Yeah. Not unlike Sam, right? They offered me a plea bargain. Do you know what that is? Sort of. You see, if I plead guilty, it could reduce my sentence. Take some time off. You haven't even gone to trial yet. No, that's why they're offering me the plea agreement. Just avoids all that. But you're not guilty, so don't take it. This has nothing to do with guilt or innocence. It's all about what... what the jury's gonna believe. What will they believe? That I'm guilty. So have you made any friends? Well, I am going on a date next week. That's good. He's a lucky boy. And Jordan came by. I miss him. Vanessa's trying to get money from Uncle Sam. Dracula lady. She says that you have money stashed. She says a lot of things. I really hope Sam isn't that bad, sweetheart. No, I'm getting used to it. And when you get past all his quirks, you'll see his heart's in the right place. Are you sure he has one? Somewhere, I mean, underneath all that crust. I'm gonna go. Okay. I'll come back as soon as I can... No, no. I don't... think this is a good place for you to come. (If) something changes, I'll have George call you. Yeah. I really love you. I love you too, Dad. How'd it go? Just discouraging. Yeah well, prison does that. I know he's innocent, and nobody will believe me. Not even Uncle Sam. I wouldn't judge him too harshly now. They're brothers. Yeah well, so were Cain and Abel. What does that mean? Well, what that means is that sometimes things aren't as obvious as you might think. You probably shouldn't judge him, as much as you want him to judge your daddy. That Kevin boy, he's pretty cute, huh? Yeah, I guess. Yeah, well you guys are going to the dance together, right. Yeah. But how did you know that? Well because Sam... he said he wanted you to have something nice to wear. He did? Yep. He's paying for it. Uncle Sam? Mm hmm. Full of surprises, huh? Come on, let's go shopping. Oh. I don't know. - Good. I know just the place. - Okay. Get in. Hi. Whoa! You look amazing. Thanks. I had help picking it out. Hold it. What? My truck. What's the matter with it? It sucks. No, it doesn't. It's not good enough for you to ride in, not dressed like that. Oh, come on, it's fine. Have her back here by midnight. I will. This is for Little Annie. Give her a couple each night for the next two weeks. Okay. And midnight for this filly. Clear? Crystal. Looks pretty good, doesn't she? Yeah. Too good if you ask me. - Dad, you think I would do it... - No? Oh... - Hey. - Hey. How are your horses doing? Good. Got a new one. You wanna see it? Yeah, I'd love to. Come on. Don't step on anything. Wouldn't be the first time. She may have been a competition horse but we're not sure. With the emphasis on "we're not sure". But I would like your opinion, though. Well, Little Annie's beautiful, but... to give you an honest opinion I'd have to ride her. - Well, maybe another day. - No, now's great. Now it's great. Well, She's had some training. Not a lot, but she sure got potential. What would it take to get her in performance shape? Three months, at least. I'd know more if I worked with her. It's better than riding a dang mule, huh? Yeah I think. It can be a pain sometimes. Yeah, I don't even know why people have 'em anymore. They're stupid, they're stubborn. Yeah, just like some people. Yeah, well you can't skin and tan some people, huh? No you can't. So you wanna go to the dance? No, I wanna get back on. (I) was afraid of that. When I get my hands on him... You'll what? I'll tan his hide. Oh come on. He'll drop you like a bag of dirt. Really? You know, I'd like to see him try. Easy there, killer. You know what, you came here to see your niece dance in her nice new dress. So she left a little early with a very nice young gentleman who comes from a very nice family. Give him the benefit of the doubt. I'll give him the benefit of the doubt, all right. Oh Addy Jane! Have you seen Kevin or Dani? No, not since school this afternoon. So they weren't here at all? If they were, we didn't see them. Sorry. You know, she coulda called. With what? You told me her cell phone's been down for months. Well, she shoulda found a way. How? A carrier pigeon? You know what, you're worse than she is. Now you're just an old poop. I am not an old poop. I'm a middle aged poop. I had a lot of fun tonight. Sorry about your dress. It's okay, it's just a dress. You know a lot about training horses, don't you? I know a little bit. Girls can surprise you. Some girls maybe, not you. What is that suppose to mean? Easy. I didn't mean anything by it. Sorry. Guess I'm just a little touchy. Or defensive. Suppose you got your reasons. We didn't really get off on the right foot anyway. No, we didn't. I'd like to make up for it. Yeah, so would I. You're late by two minutes. Yeah, I wanted to make sure she's home in time. Mm hmm. How come you didn't go to the dance? You spied on me? No, no. I wanted to see how my investment looked. So... You had a fight? We never left my place. I went and rode Little Annie. Mr. Winslow wanted my opinion of her and the only way to give him an honest one was to ride her. So Mr Winslow was there all night? Yeah, the whole time. And you rode Little Annie in your dress? Yeah, that was what I was wearing. Thank you. I had the best time tonight. The most fun I've had the whole time I've been here. I suppose I owe you an apology. No, you don't. It was the best night in my life. Yeah, if it wasn't for my mouth, I wouldn't have any place to put my feet. I wanna do it, Stormy. I think Little Annie and I could really win it. But, that would mean more time with her and less time with you. You be okay with that? I love you. - Morning. - Morning. You're up early. Yeah, felt like I was broad daylight. Made you breakfast. Oh. Did you clean up in here? Yeah, a little bit. There's no bacon. Do you wanna have a heart attack? Don't worry, I'll fix it. I'm a doctor. No, you're a vet. Yeah, a vet who likes bacon. So Kevin's dad asked me to train Little Annie. Really? You up to it? Yeah. Think I know what I'm doing. I wish I did. What about your chores around here? Well, I was kinda hoping maybe you could help me out with them. Just until I'm done training Little Annie. I mean, I barely have time to get her in shape as it is. What about Stormy? Stormy, he'll be fine. Well maybe. She's kinda getting used to you spending a lot of time with her. Well, he won't care, trust me. Okay. Uh, there's something else. What's that? I really like that dress, but I think daddy wanted me to use the money for something else. What money? The money that I gave you the first night I was here. Yeah yeah, right. Here. Do whatever you want with it. You haven't opened it. Why would I do that? It's not mine. Well, I just thought that maybe you woulda used the money to... You thought what? It's Kevin. I'm sorry. Why? Because I thought, that you use the money to... You'd better not keep him waiting. She likes training their horse, but that's not the only thing she likes to do at the Winslow ranch, isn't it? Yeah, you said it, what, teenage girls must drive their fathers crazy. Really wish I had some bacon. You know, maybe you could try a little chicken or steak. You know, something different, you know. You don't have to eat it. Think you better hit one of the stores and I'll fix it. Okay. Has he been fed? Hmm? Em, but I'm not you. What do you mean? He's lonely. He's a mule. Mules have feelings. All right, darling, come on out. You going somewhere? Yes, and he can't come with me. So you brought him here? Yes, well, you're his uncle. Well, you're his mother. You outrank me. I can't take him with me. You ask what he wants? This is best for everyone. Yeah, I'm sure. You... what, you not gonna say goodbye to him? Oh, I did already. Well, I guess you could help me with some chores. See if you can get Stormy to eat. What's the matter with him? Well, he's off his feed. I think that he's... lonely. Should get you settled in first, though uh? You don't seem too upset that she's leaving. She's just running away. That's a good point. - Where's Dani? - She ran away. She did? No, no. She's working with a filly down the road. Come on. You think my mom went too far, don't you? Yeah, and I hope she stays there. - You know my sister coming next week. - Yeah, I know, I know. I was just hoping you could help me with the kid. You need to get to know him better. This kid used to be the first one. Well, take him with you. It'll be good for the both of you. I'll come back around this afternoon. You promise? Scout's honor. You're not a Scout. I'm not an uncle either. Howdy. Morning, Sam. Who's this? Your new assistant? Yep. I'm Dani's little brother. - Well, hello there, Dani's little brother. - Hi. - Dani's over at the other corral. - Cool. - Go on. - That's a good kid. Hey, thanks for coming out this morning. Can I talk to you about something? - Sure. - Okay. Hey, Dani! Hey! Hey kiddo! Came to see if you miss me. Of course, I missed you. Who is this? This is Little Annie. I've been working with her. What about Stormy? Well, this is kinda more like the stuff I used to do with Admiral. Cool. Come on, Bud. She's spending a lot of time here. Yeah, well the event's coming up soon, Doc. I just don't get to see her that much. Well,look, I'm not trying to keep her from you. Oh, I know that. Ah, it's the competition. I need that filly to do well. And Dani is doing a great job with her. Yeah, I get it, you know. She's got her heart set on this, so... I missed you! Hey. Vanessa came by and dropped him off this morning. So, he's staying? Well, for a while. Hey, I forgot to show you this. What? Are you serious? I knew Brooke was gonna ruin him! Who's she? What do you mean, ruin him? Just nothing okay. Just forget it. How could you hate her so much? I... I don't hate her. You don't like her very much either. Well, you know, tendinitis does happen. Yeah, but... I worked so hard with him. Well then, make sure Little Annie shows everyone how it should be done. Hey, I've an idea. Maybe you could ride Stormy. Stormy's a mule, Jordan. I thought you liked her. Him and I do but... He's not a horse. You got that one right. Is that why you said he won't eat? Did I say that? Yeah. He's not eating? You know what? Jordan and I have a lot of work to do. Back at our house. So, what do you think your chances are? I don't know. Horse show's not that far off, you know? Yeah, I know that. That's what worries me. Don't worry. You'll be great. Thanks. But I kinda need more than you just saying that. Maybe I can be more. Who's Brooke? Just the girl that ruined my horse and my life. Oh, glad I asked. Stupid mule. (It's) no use. He won't eat. Doesn't mean we can't. What do you want for supper? What do you got? A lot of vegetables. Anything good? And you ain't a vegetarian? No, I'm an American. Me too. All right. How about one of this? Yeah. I've been trying to convert the wrong ones. Set the table, here, son. He wanted to wait up for you. He didn't make it. You know, he's all I have left, other than you. He's a good worker. So how's the training going for Little Annie? It's good. Only have 10 days to the competition. Who's Brooke? Her mom is the one that bought Admiral. You don't like her. It's not that I don't like her. She just... You blame her for your problems. Okay, you know what, you have no right to say that. Okay. It is my life. Well, it's not your life I was commentating on. It's the way you're living it. Maybe he forgot who you are. He didn't forget, he's just mad. Do mules get mad? This one does. No, don't eat. Come on. Oh, Stormy. Look, Sam, do me a favor. Don't listen to her. You know, you should keep your kids together. It's a little more complicated than that. Now you need to think of someone else beside yourself, Mitch. You've had a real hard time with that. You know, even when we were kids, you were, you know, great at taking but lousy at giving. Listen to me. All right? Even if there was money, if I told them about it, they would add at least five years to my sentence. Do you understand that? Minimum! Look, if you don't do something, then you're gonna lose them both. I've already lost them, Sam. No, no, you just let them down. You just... Look, I really don't have time for this, all right? It's your choice, little brother. Good. Left leg, left leg. You must cut in. Terrific. The leg. It's coming in, coming in. Use leg. Good, good. Hey, you're riding pretty good there, little man. Thanks. Is Doc around? Uh no. He went into town but he'll be back later. All right. Just have him call. Dad's flying to go look at some new stock over at Grand Junction. He want Doc to go with him. You have an airport around here? Yeah, a small one. My dad keeps his plane there. Your dad has a plane? Could I fly in it? Hey, you don't just ask like that. Yeah, you could probably go with dad and Doc. Really? I don't think it's a good idea. When? Tomorrow. Just remind him, okay, Buddy? Yeah. Thanks for stopping by. Don't mention it. Looks like there's a storm coming. Who said it was okay? Kevin did. You wanna go? Do I? - I don't know. Do you? - Yes, I do. What? Vanessa called. She want more money? Jordan. What did you tell her? Nothing. Look, she still has legal custody. And I asked Mitch if he has any money offshore like she claims. What did he say? He didn't. But you think he does, don't you? It doesn't matter what I think. He's been sentenced. No one told me that. How long? Five to ten. - Years? - Mm. So, does this mean we can't go tomorrow? I think we can still make that work out. Yeah! I hope they got out before this hit. Jordan said that they could fly over it. Plane's missing. The Sheriff got the Mayday call about an hour ago. I'm gonna go see if I can find them. Where? Birchwood Springs. He said to gather as many people as you can to go search. I'll see who I can get. I'm coming with you. You can't, I only have one horse. What about Little Annie? There's no way she'd make it up that mountain. Stormy. From their last transmission there in the Rogers Beau area here, I think if we start at the base and circle both ways, we might just get lucky. Okay. Well, then let's meet on the east side of the Beau. Okay. I'll set up base at the Birch Springs campground. Here, take this, use Channel 4. Let's go. Good luck. We'll find 'em. Come on, buddy. Come on. Stormy, stop. What's the matter with you? Come on. Look. I know I haven't been there for you and I'm sorry, okay? It was wrong. But I really need you right now. Okay? Jordan and Uncle Sam, they're lost and they might be hurt really bad. And I can't do this without you, okay? I really need you. Please do it for me. I love you. Kevin? Kevin, can you hear me? Kevin? Sheriff? Anyone? God help me, before it's too late. Cameron? He can't hear you. He's unconscious. I'm not unconscious. - Jordan? - I'm just resting my eyes. Yeah well, just rest them some more. Uncle Sam, are you hurt? Nah. Don't worry about it. We gotta get these two down the mountain right away. I'm sorry. I can't move my leg. Okay. Don't move it, just lie back down. What about you? It's nothing. That doesn't look like nothing. Don't worry about it. Come here. (I) think that Cameron's hemorrhaging internally. He's gonna die if we don't get him some help. Is that thing working? No, all I'm getting is static. (I) think the mountain's cutting reception. Up there, Elk Ridge Summit. When you raise them, they'll know where it is. - But you... - Just go. We'll be here when you get back. All right buddy. Hang in there, okay? Just a little further, boy. Sheriff? Kevin? Anyone? They can't hear me. Kevin? Please, somebody answer me. Sheriff's down the other side, but I hear you. Where are you? Jody? Jody, it's me. The plane's just below Elk Ridge Summit. Copy that. I'll send Kevin and the search party. Please hurry. Cameron Winslow has internal injuries and he's bleeding in, and Jordan and Sam both have broken bones. Didn't get all that, but somebody will be there in about an hour, maybe less. You just get 'em over down the mountain. Okay. Thank you. They're coming. Any luck? Yeah, I got them. How long? About an hour. Okay. We need to tie these ropes together, so Stormy can pull it. Wow. Not bad for a one-armed man. Yeah, that's what all the girls say. Dani, it hurts. Okay, all right. Don't lean on it. That is the ugliest horse I've ever seen. Well, that horse is gonna save your life. Come on, boy. All right. Just get your leg in there. There you go. Ready. One, two, three... Bring him over here. We'll meet them down the mountain. Oh, boy! There he comes. Hey! He's hurt pretty bad. How'd I get here? Stormy brought you. That's not a horse. Where're the others? They couldn't make it through. Well, we have to. I'll put him on my horse and ride behind. Just don't let him bounce around too much. I was wrong. About what? Mules. Well, I think the mule feels the same way. Yeah. I'll be back as soon as I can. The radios work better down below. I'll call you. You look worse than what you say. Yeah, I think I might have broken a rib. Getting hard to catch my breathe. Well, can you ride, if I carry Jordan? No! You take him. I'll stay here, I'll be okay. They'll be back up for me. Stormy! - Hey, come back! - Dani. No! No! Let him go! Stormy! But the wolves are gonna get him. Dani let him go, okay? He's on his own. Look, these wolves are everywhere, okay? We... It's gonna be dark soon. We need to build a fire. Well, do you have any matches? No. I can get a fire without matches. You have a good fire, buddy. Thanks. My leg hurts. Oh, try not to move it. What if the wolf comes? Well, don't let him know we're here. Wolf's right there! That worked. Probably won't work again though. Just keep doing it. At least it worked for now. - Uncle Sam? - Mm. You gotta stay awake. You know, it's... Dani, it's been a long day. Stormy, where are you? It's coming back. Uncle Sam? Uncle Sam! Stay back! Stormy! You came back! He brought me here. He found me down below and then took off again. I figured he was trying to tell me something. Are you okay? One time I wish you'd show up early and you're late. As soon as I get him to the Sheriff's camp, I'll be back. Are we there yet? Almost, buddy. Hang on. Cameron's gonna make it. Just came over the radio. You be able to get back on your own? Oh, yeah, well, we'll be fine. It's a great little mule. You trained him? No, more like he trained me. Thank you. Let's go home, Stormy. Thanks for helping me, bud. Are you gonna fix up Stormy too? I already did. - You wanna do me a favor? - Yeah. You wanna get him and tie him on the fence up there? Okay. Thanks. Okay little girl. You ready? Okay, come on. Come on. Did you tell 'em? No, I did not. You know, we're gonna go make some suppers. Nice to meet you. What's going on? I heard about Admiral. There's nothing we could have done. Yeah, I know. We worked so hard too. Yeah. Well, your new horse, she's beautiful. Well, I trained her, but I think you should ride her. Me? Yeah. I've already talked to the show committee and they're fine with you riding in my place. I think you got a real good shot at winning that trophy. - But why are you... - 'cause I've already got my mount. A mule? Yeah, I... I'm gonna be a trainer from now on. So do good, I need the exposure. I don't know what to say. You don't need to say anything. I do. I'm really sorry... for the way that I've treated you the last few years. I just... I took out all my problems on you and... I'm really sorry. I know that (it) isn't enough, but I hope it's a start. This is the nicest thing anyone's ever done for us. Thank you, Dani. From both of us. Thanks for giving me a second chance. Well, you better get going. I won't forget this. Go win it. And don't forget to tell who your trainer is. Don't break any of those, only ones I got. These are brand new. Well, I didn't say I used them a lot. Funny how things change. Hey, my birthday's coming. Oh really? When is it? In a month. I was maybe thinking I could... Just hold that Jordan. Hello? What? You mean now? Okay. Who was that? His mother. She's... She's coming for the boy. She got papers from the district court. No! Why don't you just tell her no? Go help your brother pack. Hey, somebody's here. What? She called from a block away? It's Jordan's mother. See if you can get him on the phone. Yeah, I will. There's only one person who can change her mind now. I would like to get back to civilization before the year ends. You know what you doing to him, don't you? Mitch? I hope he's squirming. Jordan. That is not my fault. If Mitch had just... If Mitch had dumped you two years ago, this wouldn't be a problem now, would it? There's no need to get nasty. Why not? I'm talking to a pro. Why are you doing this? Because I can. We'll get you back. I promise. I mean, what can you do? What can anybody do? So you're sure you won't change your mind? I would. For a price. Wait! This is Vanessa. You sure? You can verify that? Oh, I'll be there. But let's be perfectly clear on this. 9 am tomorrow morning. Oh, I'll take him. Fine. Sweetheart, get out. What? Oh honey, you're not coming. Come here, you. Bye bye. Who did you call? Your father's lawyer. What did he do? Nothing, but... You dad, he revealed some hidden assets to the court. He signed them over to the wicked witch of the west there. Mm hmm. That in order for her to get the money, she has to sign legal custody over to Sam. Come on, it's not that big a deal. So there's something to show you over there. Come on. Your father, he did the right thing. But how did you... Well, he told me about his hidden assets. it's 'cause she was right about that. But from the bail I get drawing away from her, he'd give up more than just money. What? They added three years onto his sentence. Oh. So, I'm staying here? Yeah, you're staying here. You know, I just remembered that I do have something for your birthday. His birthda's not for another month. So who says you only get presents on your birthday? Cool! Look at that. Don't cut yourself. And someone told me that I'm a vet not a doctor. This is for you. Mm? Here. What? It's not my birthday. Oh, just open it. I... Look I would have gotten down on one knee, but, you know, then I'd have to get all the way back up again and then... So will you (marry me)? Yes! Hey, there's something you guys should know. What? Little Annie won. Looks like you're gonna be training horses from now on. She won! I'm sorry. For what? How I acted. And... I'd like to make it up to you. Oh really? Mm hmm.
