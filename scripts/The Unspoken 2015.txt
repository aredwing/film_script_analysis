Is anyone down there?! This is the sheriff's department!! Stay where you are, you understand me! You leave me no choice but to shoot!! Whoever is in there, we can work this out!!! Please, please, we need to get outta here!!!! You're okay! No, no, you don't understand! We have to go now!!! Anything? Mother, father, two kids, gone without a goddamn trace. Did you get anything out of her? No, she's in pretty bad shape. I went to high school with her. Said she's the housekeeper here, helped out with the kid sometimes. All the blood on that girl in there, it's not hers. Not hers? Then' who's is it? I don't know, that's your job right. Jesus, what the hell happened in there? I don't know, boss, he was already hanging there when I went in. Hey, get the hell outta here!! Seal the place off! Nobody gets in here without my say so! Until we find out what happened to this family. Power's been turned on. Uh, forgive me for asking, but are you sure that you want to be doing this? The place is uh... It's an awful mess. I appreciate your concern, Mr. Walker, but we'll be just fine. We'll be just fine. Won't we, Adrian? Come on. Now don't worry, in a couple days it'll be just like home. Hey. No wandering off. We've got a busy day. Sorry! I never realized how far you live from the city. I spent nearly 30 minutes just trying to find the driveway! I am so, so sorry. It's quite alright, we just arrived ourselves. Well, well, well. Ok. Excuse me. Adrian, I thought we had a deal. No wandering off. Cookie? You ok in there? Just a dream. All good. That was a heck of a dream, huh? Can't remember the last time you had a nightmare. They didn't call? No. No, not yet, but Jim told me the mill just got a big order and they should be starting up my shift again real soon. It's been two months. Yeah, I know, but we've been able to spend a lot of time together, right? Right. Morning, Angela. Good morning, Ruby. Do you have a minute? Yeah. Is everything ok? Yes, yes. I um... I know times are tough with your father not working and all... If you're interested, there's a part-time job helping care for a nine year old boy. I'm not sure what his condition is but it sounds like the mother needs an extra set of hands. But this is... I know. It's not like these jobs come along all the time, especially around here, and the money is good. I should get back. You don't need me today? Oh, we always need you, hun, but you should go. At least pay her a visit, see for yourself. Thanks. Let me know how it goes. Wish me luck. Good one, man. Hey, Angie, where are you going? We have stuff to do, remember? Don't you be getting all hot and bothered, I'm not going far. I don't understand why you hang out with those creeps. I mean, you know what Luther is into, right? He dabbles, nothing serious. That's not what I hear. Hey pandy, why don't you bring your little friend back here, we'll have ourselves some real fun. In your dreams. I thought you couldn't hang today because you were at the daycare. I was. Mrs. Harris, one of the teachers there, she got me a job interview. Around here? With who? What? Is it something secret or something? No, it's um... It's a babysitting job at the briar house. Yeah, right. I'm on my way there now. No one in their right mind would move into this place. Not after what happened. That was a long time ago, and besides, no one knows what really happened. The family just vanished. Gone. TV still on, car left out back, food on the table. Whatever happened, it wasn't good. I don't want you to go. They're paying good money and you know my dad hasn't been working. Angela, please. At least let me go with you. Tell me I didn't just see that. Don't touch me again, you hear? I told you, I don't go that way. You suck. You're really messed up, you know that? That was uh... Pretty hot, pandy. Yeah, real hot. Shut up, the both of you! What's going on here, pandy? The girl's got issues, what do you want me to say? You exchanging love notes? It's an address. She's got a job interview. Not at the briar house, she don't. She said someone just moved in. Bullshit, we were just out there, no one's living in that place- shut it, Rodney. Who did she say she was meeting out there? Why the sudden interest? Who did she say she was meeting? You're hurting me! Who, pandy? I don't know, alright?! It's some babysitting gig! Everyone in the truck. We're gonna go see for ourselves. I'm so sorry. Can I help you? I... I um... Everything ok out here? Hi. Uh... Mrs. Harris at... At the daycare, she said you might be looking for some help. Oh, you must be Angela. Oh, thank you so much for coming out here. How are you doing on those basement windows, Mr. Walker? They've been kicked in pretty good, probably kids. They'll need replacing. You want me to go ahead and seal them up with some plywood for now? Whatever you think is best. Ok. He's kind of a creepy guy, but he's the only handyman i could get to come out here. Creepy might be an understatement. Come on, let me introduce you to Adrian. Mrs. Harris says you're great with kids, but just so you know, Adrian isn't your typical nine year old. Sorry, I um... I spent my entire life hearing stories about this place and I never thought I'd be inside. What kind of stories? Oh, just... Just silly stuff. It doesn't matter. No, really. Come on. I'd like to know. When we bought the place they said the bank had locked out the previous owners for non-payment. That makes sense, I'm sure that's what must have happened. That's not what everyone really thinks happened. People around here think a lot of things, but no one really knows. Taking a break, are we now, and it isn't even noon. We can't all be like you, portia. This one speaks the truth, don't she? Portia, this is Angela, she's going to be helping take care of Adrian when she can. It's very nice to meet you. Likewise. Maybe you'd like to do the honours? I understand it's his favourite. Sure, thanks. Come on. Before we go in, you should know... My son stopped speaking about two years ago, right after my husband died. It was like something inside him died at the same time. The doctors haven't been much help so I thought maybe getting him out of the city might be a good thing. Sounds like the right move. Yeah, move right into a house my own handyman is too scared to set foot into. Maybe that's not such a bad thing. Maybe it's not. Adrian? He likes to hide. Come out, come out, wherever you are. Adrian? Are you in here? Adrian? We're gonna find you. Adrian? Adrian? Adrian? I'm going to find you. Shoo, shoo! Go! Seems to have come with the place. Everything ok in here? Adrian is hiding again. Do you mind looking downstairs? Yeah, of course. I'll give her a hand. Adrian? Adrian? You might not talk to your mother but you're sure as hell gonna talk to me. Now what is it that you want with this place? Talk to me, boy! Mr. Walker! I found Adrian, Mrs. Peterson! Mrs. Peterson! Oh my god, what happened? I caught him trying to sneak off into the forest over there. He fell when I was chasing after him. Oh, Adrian. What were you thinking? You know you are never supposed to leave the house. Mrs. Peterson, I... I'm sorry, Angela, do you mind if we get a fresh start tomorrow? I think Adrian's had a little too much excitement today. We need to have us a little talk. So what did I tell ya? These people aren't right in the head. Don't they know what happened in that house? Nobody knows what happened in that house. Yeah, well, the original owners didn't just up and leave on their own without taking their car and their other crap. I heard they buried the bodies under the house. Yeah, like the cops wouldn't have found that already? So what happened then, genius? They're just gone, man. The house just took 'em. Will the two of you shut up? Woah, woah, what're we gonna do? Nothing. Nothing? He's gonna find it! There's nothing we can do about that now. Do about what? Let's get out of here. This is stupid. What's going on here, Luther? Nothing you need to worry about, alright? Let's go. Ok, fine. I'll tell you, ok? Just not here, not right now. Come on. Who the hell moves into a shit hole town like this on purpose? Into a place like that. Yeah, well, whatever the reason is, we have ourselves a serious problem. Listen. You either tell me what the hell is going on like you said you would or I'm out of here. I'm not thinking you really want to know, pandy. Try me. Once it's said, it's said. There ain't no undoing that. Fine. You might need to get those pretty little hands of yours dirty, are you ok with that? Just tell me. We're keeping our stash there in the house, hidden in the basement. Figured it would be the last place the cops would ever look. By stash you mean drugs? Whatever. The point is we need to get it out. And that old man in the forest? What was that all about? Rodney here wouldn't enter the house without leaving an offering, i guess you can call it. You know what? You're right. I don't want to know. We're past that point now, pandy. You're in, just like you wanted. Don't worry, they're just cats and dogs. We need to keep whatever is in that house happy, right? So what now? We go in tomorrow and we take what's ours. With all those people in there? You got a better way? Yeah. I have a better way. Morning. I see you made it in time for all the excitement. What happened? Is everyone ok? Well, it's Mr. Walker. I didn't see him after everything that happened with Adrian yesterday, but then this morning his truck was still here. But what happened to him? I don't know. The police have been out there ever since they got here. Let me just finish up here and then I'll take you inside to see Adrian. You must have made quite an impression on him, I think he's been waiting for you. Looks like it's been moved, huh? It certainly didn't get here by itself. There are some footprints over here, but they just end. They don't go anywhere. The blood on this rock can't be more than a day old, right? Where did it come from? This dog has been dead a lot longer than that. Another animal? Maybe. Get chambers down here, have her look at this. Tell her I need the results back right away, meaning not sometime next month. Go. Excuse me. Hey, Adrian. I don't think we've officially met yet. So I heard that portia has made some jam sandwiches in the kitchen, your favourite. That's crazy, because jam sandwiches are my favourite, too. What do you say we go and eat? Well I'll be damned. Ok Adrian, let's go clean up in the kitchen first. Hmm? It's... it's ok, Adrian. We'll play a game when you're done, ok? It'll be fun. Come on in. Thank you, ma'am. Miss. Now, you and your men have been awfully busy out there. Please tell me there's nothing to worry about. Well, there's been no sign of elan. Ok, well that's a good thing, right? Yeah, we think so. We did, however, find a flask, and elan is known to be a bit of a... Drinker. So what are you saying? You think he went off on a bender somewhere? Why didn't he take his truck then? Well, we think he was scared off. Scared off by what? Well ma'am, a house like this and it's history, it attracts a certain... Element. And what type of element is that? No, go ahead. Please. Say what you need to say. Alright. We found several dead animals in the forest surrounding the house. It appears they were killed in some type of ritual. Do you mean... Sacrificed? That seems to be the case, ma'am, yes. Now, as serious as it sounds, and it is serious, it's probably just a bunch of kids. No need to worry about your own safety. How can you be so sure? Well, it's been going on around here off and on for 17 years. But like I said, it's probably just a bunch of kids and the last thing they want is to be found out. And now the house is occupied, I'm pretty sure it's the last you'll see of them. Sheriff, you there? Excuse me. Go ahead. Yeah, we've got some fresh footprints about 50 feet up from the swing. Looks like they lead out to briar road. I'll be right there. Just a few more things and we'll be out of your hair. Now, if you hear or see anything, we'll be here in ten minutes. Thank you. Dio] ...We're still out here at 166 briar... Don't feel like you're obligated to stay. I promised Adrian we'd play a game. I can't very well back out now, can I? Are you sure about this? You should go and do what you need to do. Besides, half the police force is here, we'll be ok. Ok, well I just need to take this stuff to goodwill and then grab some groceries. It won't take long at all. Yeah, we're all good. You are a godsend, Angela. Thank you. Now, I promised you we'd play a game, didn't I? Ok, marbles it is. Do I get to keep that one now? I guess it would help if i knew how to play, huh? Nice shot, Adrian. Oh, no worries, I'll get it. Did your mom lock this door? I think I must have tapped it. Well, it looks like we have the house all to ourselves. I'm sorry, Adrian, I'm sorry, i didn't mean to scare you. Is someone here? It's me, it's me! It's just me. What the hell are you doing in here?! The door was open, I heard a plate smash in the kitchen, I thought you might be in here. It's kinda creepy, right? You're not answering my question. You're not answering your texts. I came to apologize. I need you to leave, pandy. Look, I'm really sorry! Ok? I'm an idiot. I panicked yesterday. It wasn't cool. I need you to leave before my boss comes back. I'm not leaving until you accept my apology. Just tell me what you want me to do to make it up to you. If you're really sorry, you'll leave right now. I need you to go, now! Adrian? Adrian? Adrian, I need you to come out, ok? I don't know how you got in there, but you don't need to hide. Everything's ok. Adrian, please. Adrian, it's been almost an hour. It's time to come out now, ok? Your mother's going to be home soon. We don't want to upset her, right? Adrian. Can you please answer? Let me know you're ok? You've been under here the whole time? But... but if you're here... Adrian! Adrian, I need you to help me! Please, Adrian! I'm sorry, but we have to go now! Adrian! What's going on? There's someone here, in the bedroom closet! What're you doing? Get Adrian out of here and call the police. But you don't know what's in there! If there's anybody in here, you're gonna wish you weren't! You must think I'm crazy. Of course not. I just think you got a little spooked is all. I'm sure there's a perfectly logical explanation. A little jumpy there, Logan. Yeah, whatever. Still no show, huh? No. Mom came back a few minutes ago but other than that, nothing. Luther's gonna be pissed. Wooo! Wooooohooo! Looks like you could use a ride. Now here I am, being all hospitable, and you don't even have the common courtesy to answer me. I don't need a ride, asshole. What do you want? Did pandy put you up to this? No. It's funny you should mention her. You wouldn't happen to have seen her today, would you? Look. I don't know what you think is going on, but it- I don't care what's going on between you two, alright? I just need to know if you've seen her today. She stopped by where I work for, like, five minutes. And? And what? That's it. She left. I knew it, she chickened out. Shut up about it, you hear me? Don't say anything. Oh, boy. Luther, Logan and Rodney. What a surprise. Everything ok over here? We're just offering Angela here a ride home is all. Angela, is that what's going on? Something like that. Huh. Why don't you go wait by my car? Go ahead. So Luther, I got a phone call today from the new owner of the briar house. Seems they had an intruder today. You boys wouldn't know anything about that now, would you? Hell, no. You'd have to be crazy to step foot in that place. Now if I recall, your driver's license is still suspended, isn't it, Luther? That'll get you a night as a guest at the county. Oh, I wouldn't do that, Luther. Not over this. Whatever. Uh-huh. You can make it home by yourself ok, right? Yes, sir. Arm. Now I don't want to see you boys by the briar house ever again, or bothering that girl. Do you hear me? Do you hear me? Yes, sir. Now take Luther's truck and get back to town. Why haven't you been answering your phone? I... I was on my bike. Honey, the daycare is five minutes away and they closed about an hour and a half ago. Cookie, you're not being straight with me. Don't get mad, ok? You started that part-time job. You said you wouldn't get mad. No, you asked me not to get mad, I never said that I wouldn't. It's just a part-time job, it's not that big of a deal. And what is this part-time job? I'm helping to look after a little boy. He stopped talking when his father died so he needs some extra attention. Well, I guess that sounds like time well spent. So where do these people live? They're the ones that moved into the old briar house. I don't understand. You've been in that house? Yes. Ok, you are quitting, you understand me? You are not to set foot in that house again. Dad, they're just stories. You're quitting! Do you understand me?! You are not to go in that house again, am I clear?! Why is it such a big deal? You are not to have anything to do with that house or the people who live in it! End of discussion! Fine. Where the hell are you? Pandy? If that's you, this isn't funny. Whatever stupid game you're playing, I don't want any part of it. Oh, no! Irving community daycare. Hi Mrs. Harris, it's Angela. I was thinking I could come into the daycare today. You didn't take the job with Mrs. Peterson? No, it didn't work out. Well that's too bad. You know, Mrs. Peterson asked for you specifically. She was quite adamant. She asked for me by name? She said you were the only one she was interested in hiring. Angela? I... I'm sorry, Mrs. Harris. I just realized I'm late for work. Angela? Push over, I'm driving. Long night, huh? Tell me you found pandy. We looked, man. She's nowhere, seriously. She can't be nowhere, she's gotta be somewhere. You talk to her folks? They're out of town. We waited at her house but she was a no-show. No phone calls, no texts, nothing? We left, like, a million messages. You heard her yourself yesterday. She was at that place for all of five minutes and then she bolted. She didn't get it done and now she's scared to show her face. So what's our move? Anybody gonna tell me what we're doing here? I thought we were going to the briar house. Don't say I never gave you nothin'. Where'd you guys get all this? Just been saving it for a rainy day. Oh, whoo. Hey, listen. You know, I'm... I'm down to kill a dog or whatever, and I'm totally down to go into this house and get what we need, but I'm not down for murdering nobody. Let me tell you something. I got twenty logs worth of product in that house! I answer to people who are dead serious about making their money! And if I don't have that product to go out and make that money, who do you think they're gonna come after?! You? Us. Alright. I get it. You saw there was cops all over that place yesterday. That's why we're not leaving any witnesses. Thank god. Portia's a no-show today and I thought you had changed your mind about coming in. Is everything ok? How is it that you knew to ask for me by name? I'm sorry... The daycare. Mrs. Harris, she said you had asked for me specifically, that I was the only one you were interested in hiring. Well, I uh... I asked around and I talked to the other parents and everyone recommended you. How else would I have known? I'm... I'm sorry. It just seemed a little- strange? Yeah, well that seems pretty par for the course around here, right? Yeah, yeah I guess it does. I hate to do this to you, especially after yesterday, but I have to find a replacement for portia and of course no one will come out to the house to be interviewed. Go and do what you need to do. We'll be fine. Are you sure? You seem to be surviving this place just fine, I'm sure I'll be ok for a few hours. You are a life saver, you know that? Oh, Adrian is just taking a nap, he's gonna be so happy to see you when he gets up. You are not of this world! This is Mike, leave a message. Hey, dad. It's me. I think I screwed up. You're gonna be mad, but... But I'm at the briar house and it's just- oh, no! Don't be afraid. You two see where they went? Didn't make it through here. Nah, I didn't see them, but sure as hell heard her. Logan, you stay in the kitchen. Watch the door. You see them, you shoot them. Those two can never leave here. We straight? Yeah. I'm gonna get what we came for. You gotta be shittin' me! How's it going down there? The basement door is missing it's goddamn handle! Everything's gonna be ok, Adrian. I'm just gonna find something to get the boards off the windows. 911, please state your emergency. Oh, no, no, no. Screw this. Argh! Argh! Luth... Luther! Luther! What the hell's going on?! Stay in the kitchen and watch the door! : Please, you gotta get me off of here! I'm all messed up! Please! Please, man. Please I need your help!!! What're you doing? Wha... You can't just leave me here! Luther! Please! What happened to Rodney? He's fine. He doesn't sound fine! Why don't you go find the girl and that kid, kill them both so we can get the hell outta here?! Alright! We're almost there, Adrian. Please! Please don't! Where's Luther? Just take whatever you want! Where's Luther?! He's in the basement at the bottom of the stairs. Oh, god! Please let Adrian go. Adrian, I know you're scared, so am I but I need you- I'm gonna make you pay for what you did to me, bitch! Screw this. Adrian, are you hurt? It'a ok, we'll be fine. Just calm down. What do you want?! Just tell me what you want! Please! Please, no! Please, help! Please! Please! Help me! Please, I need your help! Adrian? Adrian? It's safe now. You can come out. Adrian, are you in here? We have to get out of the house, ok? Adrian, we don't have time for games, ok? God cannot save you. We are not of this world. I got the kid! You want him to keep breathing you best show yourself! I won't hesitate to kill this kid! You hear me?! Do you understand me?! Just let him go. Please let him go. You see now? That wasn't so bad. That's impossible! Adrian! If you're the one doing this you need to stop, ok? It's over. We're safe now. Adrian, please! No one else has to die! Please, Adrian, you have to stop! Angela! Dad! Angela! The police are on their way, stand back! Aaarrgh! Dad! Dad! Adrian, stop! Your mom was right, whatever lives in this house, you need to kill it! Adrian! You need to kill it, now! Adrian, you're killing him! That's my father! You need to stop, please! Please! Adrian! Adrian, please. Please, I'm begging you. Angela. Aw, my sweet. I thought you were going to stay in bed today. Oh, thank god! Thank god! I had such high hopes for you, Angela. Adrian really likes you. Just let us go, ok? Please. Your mother, she worked for the previous tenants. Their children loved her very much. But unfortunately, when she discovered the truth, well, I understand when she couldn't get anyone to believe her. Your father included. She killed herself. She thought the family was possessed. Filled the place with crucifixes. So typical. Demons, possessions, hauntings. It's how your kind has tried to explain our presence for centuries. What do you mean, "our kind"? What the hell does that make you? Where I'm from, we're required to mature our young in more primitive worlds so that things like... Well this don't happen in ours. Just until they can control themselves. So you're... Let's just say we're the reason your haunted houses exist, and we return to them frequently. See, you people expect these things to happen in homes like this, so it affords us some... flexibility. But I saw my mother. Mmm. You thought you did. You humans have such imaginations. Why are you telling me this? Adrian wants you to come with us. Come with you? Adrian almost killed my father and he murdered all those people. Adrian's not a murderer! He was protecting you. Just like you protected him. It seems we don't have much time. If you stay they'll never believe you. They never do. Just think about your mother. I... I can't. Did you ever finish your game of marbles? I told Adrian he's probably scaring you, but... Boys will be boys. Angela! On your feet. Drop the knife. Looks like we're almost there. I think you're really going to love this place. I really do.
