I sent it away! Out of the way! Now! Watch or be violated! Where are going? Get away! Go, go, go. Hey! Let the vehicle pass! Stop the truck. Watch the car! Get away! Army Vehicles. Down! Come on, hurry! Leave. Down! Go, go, do not stop. Without violence. Go, go, go. Do silence. Come on. Speech Petchora 6. Change. Lieutenant Gorkin? Sergeant Tsvetkova. I brought new orders. They out of men? They're sending girls now? The messenger was killed. I took his job. You don't even bother to read it? I heard. "No retreat". Shoot anyone who does. Don't try to scare anyone, kid. Just get me reinforcements. Your new company, sir. Down. More down. Go! Go, go, go! These? Stick them up your ass. I asked for soldiers, not profs and students. Lieutenant, did you hear me? Receive the company and attack! Shut your mouth, you snot-nose brat! I have my orders too, Lieutenant. And if you think I will not obey them... Comrades Militiamen! If you don't have a weapon... take one from the dead. Or pick one up on the battlefield. Alright, guys... Troops! Attack, Lieutenant! Still here? Go home. Save yourself. No use staying here. With me! Advance! Where are you going? Attack! More down. Where you going? Go back, go! I said go! Tsvetkova, what are you doing? No more retreating! Enough! For the Motherland! For Stalin! For Leningrad! Stop, you are not allowed! You know, it is not allowed! They're retreating! Keep the posts. Fuck you! I am disappointed, very disappointed, Von Leeb. You promised to take Leningrad in July. Then August. It's now the end of September. The city is completely surrounded, my Fuhrer. But not taken! I am moving the point of attack to Moscow. I'm giving Von Bok the first and sixth tank divisions... My division... Goopner's group, Reinhardt's corps... the 36th Motorized Division and Mahnstein's tanks. This morning I appointed Zigelmeyer... deputy superintendent of the army. Formerly, he was... Director of the Munich Food and Nutrition Institute, my Fuhrer. According to the Laws of energy conservation... in order for the organs of the body to function... they must receive fuel energy. Our body is like any engine, gentlemen. In physiology this fuel is calculated in calories. to sustain life. Listen, Von Leeb! Von Leeb, guess what's going to smash Leningrad instead of you? According to the latest intelligence... the daily ration in Leningrad... is down to 300 grams of bread a day. That's 500 calories. The Fritzes! They're digging in! We've stopped them! We've stopped them! Breakfast... Lunch... Dinner. A fine diet, indeed. Total extinction when? If our troops maintain the siege... When?! Three months maximum. Two million people will die of starvation... until January 1942. This is 2/3 of the population of Leningrad, my Fuhrer. Leningrad is blocked by German troops, comma. The Russian army has no forces... to combat the stranglehold the city. Supplies of food will be cut. Point. Only a narrow corridor, by Lake Ladoga... is still controlled by Russian troops. The situation is more precarious every day. Food comes to town by Lake Ladoga... but little and does not cover the needs of the population. Next paragraph. Hospitals begin... Besides the exchange of fire in bombing and air... the storms of October begin to reach Ladoga. Only one of 20 boats with supplies to Leningrad... can browse in safety... Point, end of report. SAVOY HOTEL, MOSCOW Can you live without him for a five minutes? Who? Mr. Parker will show. Oh, he... I'm not waiting for him. Apart from the Pulitzer prize what is so great about your Mr. Parker? Redder than the Soviet flag? Wait till you see it unfold... And heels! Would you prefer me in these couple of ugly boots I have for Leningrad? Oh, really! I can't believe we are finally going! After three months of those endless and phony Moscow press releases. Well, actually, it's only one reporter from one country. England is sending Finley... and the Times is more powerful than your Telegraph. I'm sorry, Kate. I am not going? There wasn't anything I could do. But you know, how long I waited for this chance! Yes, but if this thing happens, it will only be for a day. We'll go in a dawn, and get out in a dusk. There will be nothing to see, I promise. Look, there is your pal Chigasov... the one you are keeping deep in booze and cigarettes. If you tell him to put me into reporter list, he will! Go on, Phil! Tell him! And it will be done! Kate! I want you to be safe! If it was up to me, I'd send you somewhere far away from here! What? Like Australia, or whatever... That's what it is! Katy! How rude of me! I seem to have abandoned by dancing partner. Kate! See you in Leningrad, Phil! This is Leningrad speaking... with official broadcast information... from the Leningrad Front... Fall in! Foreign reporters are coming. Repeat their duties. Keep order. No bread lines. No panickers or whiners. Stay out of sight. Clear? Sir, yes, sir! Comply with the orders. The city has 7 days worth of flour left... Sugar? And because we've been graced with five... oh, forgive me, six... six foreign journalists... It has been decided to split everyone into six groups. One foreigner per group. And each visits a designated area. Why split us up? Fair question. I can't possibly afford to lose... the entire foreign press corps in one incident. Can I, Mr. Finley? I'm going to the anti aircraft unit... and then on to the lake Ladoga. The very best assignments before they even announced. Why don't you join me? Perhaps, you'd like to write my piece for me as well? Okay, break it up. Now! Break it up. No bread today! Okay, go. Going, going. All right, moving. We've been here since five in the morning! For one little foreign poodle they put on an entire show. It is there where to go to get bread, now. Hide! Hide! Go. Walking. Come on, disperse! Hurry! Katya, where are you? Here I am! We must go. Walter! You are a good pilot! Start thinking about that second Cross. Uncle, is it true the Fuhrer's new plan is no longer... to take Leningrad, but to wipe it off the face of the earth? If the Russians' fault... their meaningless resistance... And here I thought that they were the barbarians... Well... German reconnaissance broke, but we threw them back. You can take pictures. Then we move on. Attention! Headquarters of Leningrad's Air Defense announces an air alert! Attention, air raid! Air raid! To the shelter! Get to the bomb shelter! Now! A trophy! I'll hang it on the office wall! You are not put off? Not disgusted? Well, I worked at a crime scene for two years. Dead bodies at the morgue almost every day. Every day... I see... Vernik is from Leningrad. What did you write about before the war? Exhibitions, mainly... Art department. Hey, man! Are you fed up with life or what? Forget the horse! Go! And where shall I put my horse? How can I leave it here? Come on, turn the horse! Are you all right, Vernik? Messerschmitts! Get back into the bus! We can make it to the bomb shelter! Hurry, go! Fast! Chocolate! My daughter will be so happy! Vernik, go! Go, go, go. Go! I'm going! Vernik, go, go! Vernik, we outta here! Go, go, go. Kate! We are going! Wait for us, please! Down! Ageeva, where are you going? There was an air raid. The journalist group got hit. Mainly foreign. You stay here. If there's a call from the headquarters... tell them everyone's out searching. Yes, sir. Continue. Yes, sir. Come on. Hey, do you copy? In listening? In listening? Headquarters? The English journalist never made it back. Who's there? All Leningrad was bombed, Parker. Did you know that when placed the lady Davis on the list. I'm sorry. Korneev? Korneev? I can not leave. There is a man there... Yes, a woman. Stop! Comrade journalists! This is Captain speaking. You must board now. We must get to Moscow before dawn. A drink, please. Girls... She's not Russian. Okay, where is your "spy"? We collect. She's babbling in some language. Suspicious. Oh. It's you! They have found you... Omelchenko, damn! Why the hell are you toiling along? It's time! Kate? Kate? Kate? Kate! Let me through! I am here, Kate! Get out of here! Korneev? Parker? Parker? No one else survived. Malinin! Recognize it? This is hers? Parker, listen to me! Listen to me! Go to the airplane! Go! Do you have papers? Got it... No papers... Comrades Journalists, I repeat! Board the plane, everybody! Come on! Get up! Get up! Lady... lady... Don't die on me! Please! What I am supposed to do with you? Attention! It's Leningrad speaking! The Information Bureau announces... In different parts the Western front... the Germans have undertaken several violent attacks at our positions. Draw up! Which the German nazy troops lost up to 50 thousand soldiers... dead and wounded, over 250... through the Osinovets and Kokorevo piers... delivered for the last 30 days. But the city consumes and that's at the ration of of the population. How long can we hold out? If we were to lower the rations... Are you out of your fucking mind? How can we reduce? Do you want an open riot on our hands? Nine days Nine? Nine days it is then. Company, the car! Hurry, go. Hi there. Come on, come on, come on, get on! Sorry, I didn't mean to wake you. Are you all right? Dystrophy. Like everyone these days. I'll help you... You shouldn't move. Tsvetkova asked to look after you while she is away. I live upstairs. Call! She's probably shell-shocked. She dies then we're to blame. We call. Ok, ok. It was me who personally reported... an Englishwoman killed. Killed? Personally. It means that I personally identified the dead body... But it is half the problem. I reported it to a Security Commissar. He obviously called the Kremlin. That called the embassy of them... already called it is known there for those in England. What we are supposed to do now... tell them all we fucked up here? What else is there? Kill her? On October 6, cut the electricity. Is she under arrest? Who? Exactly - who? Did you see her papers? She lost her papers. So you are trying to stick me... with some skirt with no papers? October 14, the water pipe burst. Your firearm. On the table. Now! Where is she? Answer me! Where? They cut the phone on September 8. Out there. In the motorcycle. The sidecar. Come here. So? She ran away. It is my fault, I'm ready a... Are you crazy? You are playing with fire. Do you know who is singing there? In the living room? Vozdvizhenskaya Anastasia Andreevna herself. The biggest star of the Leningrad operetta. It's my mom, who is accompanying her. And Tsvetkova's mother is a housemaid here. But Tsvetkova is ashamed of her for being a servant. As soon as she heard, that the police took women... she joined it. Just to get away from here. These are all Tsvetkova's sports awards. She won them while at university, before she became a cop. She set the city record in skiing. Twice! It's she, who taught me English. Take a look. Temporary refugee identification. The real deal. Got it in the station. I stole it. Never done this before. Now you can eat. I'll take it to Yura. No. Yura will have his own food. Eat! Cost me all my savings. SAVOY HOTEL, MOSCOW Phil! Finley! It's major Barlow, your pilot. He'll fly you to London. Sir? When you'll see her parents, tell them... that their daughter was a hell of the reporter. Mommy, look, there is a cannon over there! Gonzales Katerina Garsievna? You are a Spanish communist... who escaped the bloody hands of a Franko's fascist regime. I am? We do not have British political immigrants here. But quite a few Spanish barely speaking Russian, like you. Please, memorize this: You were on vacations here... then the war and bombing and everything you've got is gone. Why I must pretend? You will, unless you want to be shot on the spot. By the first patrol you'll meet. Never leave the house without this. Who knows, you may even end up getting coupons. Coupons? Food coupons for bread. I'll give you some. Look, you're being extremely kind, and I appreciate it very much. I shan't be staying here that long. I'll be going back to Moscow. They must be looking for me by now. You think I need you here? There you go. Three days worth. And believe me, no one is looking for you. No one. You died. It's in everybody's reports. And there are no way these reports can be changed. Look, you do not understand! I work for a daily newspaper. And I must file daily reports to London. I can't stay here for a week, or a month, or a year. Look around you. Do you see little Yura? Do you see half of our city don't ever get out of bed. Stay for a week. Try to survive just one day. This is Leningrad speaking. The following is a bread ration decree... of the Provisional Food Supply Commission. Workers, their spouses and children, 150 gm a day. Lowered rations again! Give us some bread! Starved by our own! Let the Germans in, they'll at least feed us! Who said "Germans"?! Disperse these bastards! Come on, go home! Go! Air raid! Get down! Get away! It's on delay. It could blow any second! People! Look! See what it says! It's sugar! It's sugar! It's sugar! The Germans dropped sugar for us! Exactly! While our own starve us to death! There are no real bombs like that! Why are we staring at it?! Just open it! Are you crazy? Out of your mind?! What are you doing?! Disperse! Get away! Stop, please, stop it! Idiots! Are you blind? Hunger made you mad? It's a bomb! Back off, stop! Get away! Quit dreaming! Do you really think the Germans would drop sugar? Why? It's a bomb! You'll die! Gone. All my makeup, stolen... Anastasia Andreevna... I know, I know... They are using it to fry food. They eat lipstick, right? Well, they've eaten it all. As our director, please, tell me... why they don't just evacuate us? I went to the headquarters. We are the last working theater in the city. Apparently, Party Headquarters needs us as a symbol. A symbol of what?! Fine, I'll evacuate myself. Any General can have me. If you refuse, write to Zhdaniv. I'll write to Stalin himself! One symbol to another! Hi. See? Even Spaniards visit us. Like life goes on. Help her, I promised. Give her a job. Please, help, help my father! Ageeva, stay with him! Okay! If we must burn something... Yura and I decided to start with the Germans. He is a sort of our genius. They wrote it in the Leningrad Pravda. A treasure is found in Griboedov district. That's my Yura. If it weren't the war, he would be a chess master. At twelve years old. He didn't redeem his coupons. He lay on the couch all day. Even though the mother of Nina took me to the bread queue. Good thing I redeemed mine. Hello, I'm Kate. Hello, I'm Sima. Yura is a genius, of course, but he is very weak. I'm strong. I used to go to the ballet school. Ballet school? Sima, come here. This is for you for tomorrow. This is for you for today. This is for Yura for tomorrow. You hear? This is for Yura for today. Go and give it to him. Wait... Give it back. This is for you too. Go and give it to Yura. Mom, too many for me. Do what I said! Oh, no! Come, sit down! Swollen. I drink water all the time. Mother is right. I'm letting everybody down. You must never ever say such a thing about yourself again. You'll recover, Yura! You'll be a chess champion. Hey, something out about your chessboard. Are you missing a man? No. Perhaps, that is an extra one? Chocolate! Real chocolate! Go ahead! Eat it! You'll be all right, Yura! I promise. You'll be all right. Where have you been? I've got to get back to the barracks. Up at Sonya's house. Saw her children. Here, our Soviet vodka. I saved it from before the siege. Drink! It's a must! Bottoms up! And what is that to celebrate? It's your birthday today. Oh, no! My birthday is in July. Check your refugee ID. When I filled it up, I made up the date. Today I noticed it. A birthday! Time for gifts! What have you done! I do not tell you. You have to look. Reporter? Then write! Happy birthday! We are using all the kerosene and candles! A holiday is a holiday! Now, tell me about men. Men? They have two arms and two legs, make that three. I mean being with them. Loving, kissing, physical mechanics. Physical mechanics? Love is not funny. It is when I do it. Recognize it? Show me how to make the guys ruled. Tell me about your Mr. Parker. Mr. Parker... I think, he must have had about thousand of women. In the bed? He just seems to know how to do. How to touch you, so the electricity just run through your body. How to hold you, how to caress you. And then how to undress you. Slowly... slowly... And then? And then you just stop thinking. Your realize that there is no shame. You can do anything. With him. Your bodies belong to you both at once. And nobody needs to tell you a thing. You've known it all along. You just need to take it in. It's yours. He is yours. Do you know, that you are not going to see him again? Ever. You are not getting out of here. No one is getting out of here. Neither of us. This blockade will never end. Mr. Parker? Mr. Parker. Please forgive us. We went for a walk. We weren't expecting you so soon. I took an earlier train. I'm Priscilla Davis. Kate's stepmother. Very nice to meet you. This is Kate's father... Grevitsky, Alexei Valerianovich. Yes, the famous Russian White Guard general. We don't have to hide it anymore... since Katya is no longer with us. Kate's mother. She died before the revolution very young in Switzerland. Where Kate was born and spent her early years. When Aleksey's army was defeated by the Bolsheviks... they stopped in England. Kate was ten. Not a penny to their own. So, Aleksey wrote his renown memoirs... and I edit it, and help him get them published. We've been together ever since. Kate became a real English women. She even took my surname Davis. This was a necessary precaution, because we worked hard for years... to make sure that the KGB never guessed who his daughter truly was. It was important to her. Because she knew, that sooner or later... in spite of everything, she would get back to Russia again. I receive it from London at night. She was an English woman from head to toe. But her homeland was Russia. That's where she was born and that's where she died. As usual, Parker creates a sensation. Grevitsky, Alexei Valerianovich. Nobleman, committed monarchist. Lieutenant General of the White Guard. Fought us to the end. And dear father to our "so very British" Kate Davis. We checked through all the channels. She cleared highest security. And we missed her anyway. Missed her or... Or what? Think, Chigasov. Or British intelligence outwitted us. Accurate. Hold on. Aren't you on duty? Where are you going running? I got some food for my mother. Liar, every day will running somewhere. Mother, or a girlfriend? Mother, or a girlfriend? Speak! Please, Kolya... Kiss me... Go, Go. State security called me. A journalist who fled of your motorcycle. Old General Grevitsky, heard of him? Yes, sir, my father faced in the civil war. And he's the father of your phony English journalist. What? Accurate. White Army, the enemy of the people. So I'm thinking now, if this daughter didn't die... someone has been helping her stay alive. Maybe, out of ignorance. Why not learn who is dealing. But now that someone knows... They would be a traitor to the Motherland. And can only blame themselves. Katya, where are you? Sonya! It was smaller audience today. Everyone seems to have lost hope. And you, Sonya? Do you still have hope? I know, we'll break the siege soon. It's that why are you keep taking from Yura's ration. What? And secretly add to your daughter's. Are you seeing things? Yes, I punished Yura once, but... It's not just once. And you know it. I give Sima. From mine too, almost all of it. Yes! But it's your choice! Yura has nothing to do with it! Yura will die anyway and so will I. And you too most likely. But Sima has a chance. And you! Who are you to say this to me? What can you do for Yura except lying to him? What? What are you talking about? I don't know what you promised him, chocolates every day or just a miracle. Sure, you meant well... but I can't do miracles, neither can you. The stores refused our coupons today... but here's what I got at the black market. Human stuffing? God forbid, Anastasia Andreyevna. Onions. What did you swap for it? The earings. I kept the big ring. Hello, Katya Fuhrer is very unhappy with the situation in Leningrad. So he sent me looking for him. The Russians are desperately clinging to their lives... They lowered the food rations? Didn't they? Yes. And they will do it again! The lake is icing over. So supplying food via ship is getting suicidal. But Russians now think they can use the ice. They are going to eat it? Bon appetite! No, their plan... is to lay a road across it. But three weeks at least till the ice hardens. Too early to truck food across ice. Mother Nature is on our side, don't you think? And that means... That means... in three weeks the city named Leningrad... Gone. This is Leningrad speaking. Broadcasting a decree... of the Provisional Food Supply Commission... and Council of War of Leningrad. To avoid that end the provision of bread... to the troops and the people... Hey, what are you doing!? It's alive! Canned meat? American... Straight from the front. You! Perfect that it's you. How many times I told myself... "Don't let strangers into the house". They say, there are only two such rings in Leningrad. You should think so... 8 carats! Besides, one of them is in Hermitage. But somehow they stole mine! Sonya? Yura! Sima! It's only Yura there. He can't come to the door. To the wall! What? What are you doing? A thief on top of everything else. It's for Yura. Who do you spy for? Tell me! Spy! Please! An operetta diva... a bunch of state hands in a musical comedy theater. Now, there is a gold mine of war time intelligence! Then why be here at all?! Because all my life I dreamt of coming back to Russia. I worked myself to the bone to get here! And it's just as much my Russia as it is yours! We'll sip some hot water and try the other store. So now you know precisely who I am... and if you feel you must, you can arrest me. The guys, who declared you dead, they are looking for you again. And sooner or later they will come to me. Keep the food. Do not go back to Anastasia's. From now we don't know each other. You survive, great! Do your best. And you as well... Anastasia Andreevna, Katya asked me... What? And Katya is remaining here, too... If I get to Moscow to get this note to a journalist there. But how could I? They are shipping us to Kazakhstan... and you will have more opportunities. "Phil Parker, Savoy Hotel. The New York Times Foreign Bureau... " Katya and an American? Believe me, speaking by all! But are evacuating only the most valuable artists. You are flying with me tomorrow? Right? Day after. Tomorrow is for actors and... And then, that's it for the theater. Done. Over. Nina? You won't get away, son of a bitch, don't even think about it! Why am I writing? Most likely I will burn these pages... just as we will burn all of the books, furniture and flooring... to keep the stove going. The Nazis bombed the food warehouse. Now the market sells the glasses of warehouse dirt. Top soil, one hundred roubles. Second meter down, fifty roubles. People believe that sugar and fat melted into the dirt. Add water to make tea... quite filling and tasty, they tell me. They are playing Beethoven. A German's music conducted by a Jew. So, you have requested to be furloughed. A reason? Just a bit tired... You've been seen drunk quite a lot. Have I been denounced already? You've been avoiding missions at every turn. As my nephew I can forgive you much, Walter... But first, and most, you are my soldier... Really? I thought that soldiers fought soldiers. Not starving grandmothers. And I am first, and foremost, your General... Who orders troops to shoot down... anyone who flees the city. Makes sense, of course. "The more people stay in Leningrad... the less caloric intake per person. " The Fuhrer's Master Plan? If we are what the Germans have become, uncle... then Beethoven is a Russian. Or a Jew. To hell with your cheap sentiments. Go sleep it off in the brig. Tonight you will fly exactly according to schedule. I personally see it orders are fulfilled. They'll pick me up here. Anastasia Andreevna. A favor, please. Give this to... The American man in the Hotel Savoy? How did you know? You broke with Katerina because of me? Anastasia Andreevna, please! Yes, because of me. Now... take this key. It's for the jewelry box. Take whatever you need. I don't need anything. Well, I do. I need you to survive. Both of you. Give this old stage whore... a reason to go on living. Malinim and his family. Here they are, it's time. Promise me you'll survive. Just promise! Now... give me a hug, yes. Like when you were... that chubby brat of a baby peeing on everything... Before you became this redneck in your disgusting dirty black boots. Come on, give me a hug... Ninka, my Ninka. A photo, a basket. A box of hats. My little puppy... It is strange, nobody should go, only you. But it is the opposite. Anastasia is gone, we will tomorrow. Only you will be. Walter, how are you feeling? Ready. Speech to Leningrad radio. The HQ Air Defense informs... The city is under an air alert! Crank right, Polozkov! See it?! Fire! Fire! It is stupid, they will hit us. After him! After him! After him! Walter, I'm done. Your turn. And hurry it up! Just looking for a target. Move over! I'll get this bastard! Walter, what gave you? Want to get the gun for defense? Just maintain altitude. Walter! Walter! Walter, I'm ordering you! It's a suicide! Hoesdorff, I'm ordering you! Walter, stop joking around! It's a suicide! Shit, Walter! No, we die! Fire! Misha, the raid's over... Misha! Misha? Go! We do a fly over every day. Most of the southern sector is already iced, except here. So run the route around it, goddamn it! May I suggest, we find the eight to ten best skiers in the city. Send them. On foot is the real test. You better look it from the plane. Osipov! Write up an order! Immediately. Comrade Zhdanov. Under the command of Major Tolkunov... to immediately, underline it, immediately... begin foot search across the Lake. You have twenty-four hours. Not enough time! They won't make it alive! Out of three groups? Someone will. Yura? Are they still sleeping? I saved you something to eat. You've got to be strong today. It's your first ride on a plane. Isn't that great? Est se sentindo bem hoje? Sonya? Sonya? Sonya! Wake up! Sonya! What? Mommy?! Kate? Kate Davis? Parker? Phil? You are here? The actress gave me your note. I knew you are still alive! I've got a car! Come, Kate, come! We'll take the children with a plane. Time for you to go! Can't rest for too long soon... you won't be able to get up at all. Yes! I'm coming! Phil! Parker? Katya? Katya? Come here! I got in line. Come here, Katya! Come! Come here! Kate! Kate! Sonya! Kate Davis? Daily Telegraph? You died in October. You died too, Korneev. No, only wounded. Katenjka! My God! And so, all this time you were... Get in the car. There is flight to Moscow. You are coming with me. Get in the car. No, no, no. You'll come with me. This is fantastic. I can't believe it! My house. Stop the car! Katya, we have no time. You've missed it! Stop the car! Stop now! Katya! Where are you going, Katya? I must get the children. What children, Katenka? You don't have children! Ok, ok, ok, ok. We'll get the children. But not now, later! Now we have to make the plane. It won't wait for us! No, you don't understand. The children are not hallucination, Korneev. Maybe you are! Come on! Pull him! Come on, come on! Come on, guys! Where is the Major? Inside the cabin! Fell in! Driver's with him! Pull! Go! Sanya, give me your hand! Your hand! Hang in there! Go! Nade, Sanya! Go! You're sure you can't be mistaken? Take a cigarette. Comrade Commissar, I was smitten with her. So she is Ekaterina Gonzales now... Yes. I saw her ID. She's staying with the actress Vozdvizhenskaya. I tried to pull her out... but she went on and on about some children... Okay, you can go now. I'm ready to fly right now. What? Where? To Leningrad. We'd better get her out or she'll die. I'll take care of it. Go now. Thanks. Thanks for the information on time. Go. Korneev! Comrade! Comrade! My coupons! Stop, man, stop! If a person has nothing to eat, except a tiny piece of bread... he suffers severely at first. But after a while the pain becomes dull. And turns into listless indifference. Suddenly, you find yourself surrounded... by obstacles you can't overcome. The stairs are too stiff to climb. The shelf too high to reach. Too far to bend down to draw the water from the hole in the ice. All you want too do is lie down. In Leningrad when people say if someone, he lay down... it means "it's the end". The glue has flour in it. False lead. Yura, you think that it's time to die? Kate's Korneev hasn't come. They probably shot down his plane. Planes always get shot down. It's my fault. Why? I gave Korneev the wrong address. Anastasia's downstairs... False lead. Told you there was nobody here. Down the door for nothing. Not a false lead. No... I want to know everything about this actress. I am clear? Everything from the birth. Friends, relatives, interests. Whom she fucks and what she prays to. Nina hasn't come either. She must be dead. Otherwise she'd be here. If we fall asleep and leave the stove open... we'll die from the fumes. They say it is nice. It gives you sweet dreams. I guess Yura is right. It's time to die... Though, too bad we'll waste our food coupons. Should be able to exchange somewhere. Checkmate. Show the documents. Ladoga ski group families only! I'm Ladoga group! There you are. Sure, you can go, go. Okay, cool. Mother! Let her go! Mother! Ten trucks will convoy. Five with ordnance made in Leningrad. The rest will take the... families of the Ladoga skiers. Our way of thanking them. How many people are out there? Major Tolkunov is dead. Only 8 out of 36 people returned. They will escort their families. And then come back with food supplies. Good morning, Sir. What? I've found out something interesting. Vozdvizhenskaya had a maid. Died recently. Maid had a daughter, Nina Tsvetkova, a cop. From the same precinct where the Brit spy disappeared. She participated the search for the English. Easy, documents. Say again, whom do I connect you to? It is not clear? Moscow. Moscow. Newspaper Pravda. Senior correspondent Korneev. Telegraph is only for the military. Now! I have orders! She is twenty minutes late. She'll be here, Sima, she'll come. First, we will drive on ice. Will it be really slow? Depends on how much bombing... And then they will put us in an orphanage? Don't worry about that now, Sima. Let's just get ourselves out of here. Comrade Captain! May I be dismissed for a few minutes? Negative! We are about to line up. I need to get my family! Family? Aren't they here yet? They need my help! What are you talking about, Tsvetkova! Comrade Zhdanov is about to make a speech! Group! Fall in! To leave today. Get up. We can't wait for Nina any longer. We are going. Just a little rest. No, Sima! We can't rest! We must leave! Sima, get up! Get up, Sima! That's an order! We must leave! - The suitcase... - Forget the damned suitcase! Let's go! Let's get to the table. I have another idea. Lean on! Over my shoulder... One, two, three... Korneev! Alive just with a walkingstick. And you are leaving, I heard? I think they no longer need me here. They hardly let me work. May be one more assignment? I've got a word from Leningrad. The route of life is opened. First transport over the lake comes tomorrow. I can't even get out of this hotel. Nobody will give me papers to leave Moscow. You need to be there. KATE IN LAKE TOMORROW BE THERE Korneev! Go! Korneev? Is the Chief here? No, sir, Comrade Major! And Tsvetkova? Tsvetkova? She was transferred out. Who moved? Where to? How would I know, sir? When the Chief is back he can tell you. Come over here and rest for a moment before we go. Did I hurt you? Is your head all right? You told my mother... she was killing me to save Sima. You knew about that? She had no choice. As you don't have one now. So, if you want to be kind, be like our mother... take Sima, put her on the sled. No, I won't leave you here. I can't... What can you do? Carry me down four floors? Yes! I'm staying too... Sima... I'm staying. No, you are not staying! No one is staying. I promised you everything will be all right. And it will! Please, help Sima. And me take me back to the kitchen... Nina! Good day, sir! Please, take my daughter with you. Get her to the other side. Leave her at an orphanage. Tell them that her mother's gone. What? Zina gave all her food to Dasha. Will you take her? Come over here, Dasha. Go. That's my family. So? Go Dasha. God willing, we'll see each other again. You hold on! Your documents. Dad! My daughter! Dad! You must be strong. And I'll come for you. I promise. Go to Aunt Nina, Hold on. These are mine! Katya! Katya! Nina! Nina! Well, here we are. Convoy! Stop! Open the boards! Supply company! Quicker! Medical orderly! Come here! Quicker! Everybody, come to the field kitchens! Where is the convoy now? There! Get to them immediately! Okay, we can do it, then what?! Check each and every one of them?! Tomorrow she'll turn up at the British Embassy! And that's it! We've lost her! Well then, we've lost her! The real enemies are closing in on Moscow... strangling Leningrad. And we, as usual... go on playing our old bullshit games! Well, there it is... we lost her. Come to the field kitchens, everybody! Drivers! Check the equipment! Why are you dawdling there! Run! Hurry up! I'll talk to Parker, we will be waiting here, when you'll get back. Wait for whom? You and Yura. You'll get back to Leningrad and take him. Katya, it was a reward. And now I return to my police station. I'm on duty, you forgot it? Then send Yura. It's impossible. Yura is so weak... he can't even get up. Well, there must be some way out! Go, and don't worry about Yura. I will be near him. Here... the canned meat... crackers, medicines and a bottle of whiskey. Thank you. Drive the carts back from the trucks! Go, go... Katya... Hurry up! Hey, Tsvetkova! Move it! I'm coming, Comrade Captain! Soldiers! Hurry up, finish loading! Kate, get in. As soon as we get this thing we're out of here. Come on! Let's go! Say Phil, pay attention will you? Try it again! Sima, Phil is a very good man. And we are going to Moscow with him? And you are going back with Tsvetkova? To Yura... I knew it... Start the engines! Move out. Phil, where the hell is she going? Nina! Wait! What the hell is she doing?! Stop! Kate! Kate! They evacuated us to Syberia. I've stayed after the war and went to the ballet school. Now I'm a prima of a local dance theatre. It's not Leningrad, but it's good. Prima? That's great! Sima! Sima! I stopped at Anastasia's. She said you left already. Hello, you must be Phil Parker. Yes, Parker. I'm Yura Krasko. Well, should we have a drink? In memory of our loved ones. Ok. You must remember... You sent me a bottle of whiskey in 1941. And I've had a taste for it since then. Come in, I have a car. Here... and here. EKATERINA GARCIEVNA GONZALES NINA KONSTANTINOVNA TSVETKOVA THE SIEGE OF LENINGRAD LASTED 882 DAYS. NEARLY 1,500,000 PEOPLE DIED. ON JANUARY 27, 1944...
