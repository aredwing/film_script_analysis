The sky is absolutely clear... there are a few clouds. The umpire is inspecting the pitch. The bats man is ready. Fielders be alert. Here comes the bowler who bowls faster than the wind. lll hit a sixer on the very first ball! Sixer! Sixer! Hail Lallu Prasad! Hey Lallu! You always get out at the first ball! l know but thats only to give the bowler a chance... - What? - lts your batting. - No, l will play. - You? Last time you batted, you broke a leg. Applause. - This time Prem will teach me. - l...? First field properly at the boundary. - You always send me to field. - Fielding for him for years. - What? - Youll field and hell bat. - And youll bowl. - Kapil Dev, save my name. Beware. Here comes Lallus googly! Catch the ball! lm dead! - Dont say that. - Broke my back! What are you doing here? She came to learn cricket. What a game this is! A pain in the neck! - Kids will play. - Shut up! - Bless me aunt. How often have l told you not to address me as aunt? What a pain! ln this house, pets servants, everyone is pampered! - l am dead! - Why is she in a hurry? She has come to talk to your uncle. Brought a proposal for your brother. Rajesh is praise worthy no doubt. The world agrees. lts no easy task maintaining this business. - What do you say? - Absolutely. Now think of his marriage. - Tell us if you find a girl. - lve already done that. - You have met my elder brother? Ritas father? - Yes. lm referring to Ritas elder sister, Sweety. She stayed with them while Rita always stayed with me. Shes a very pretty, docile and intelligent girl. Yes, she failed in B.A. Shes very modern and has broken off a couple of engagements. So what? Look at their house and life style. They have a business of lakhs. The marriage will be held in style! Shell bring a lot of dowry. Youll never understand matters of the world! After all youre just a professor! lll inform my brother if you agree. lts time for our kitty party. Lets go, fast! - We are going. - Thanks. - What? - Nothing. - Good day. Come on! Always hogging! She is blinded by wealth. Well bring a sweet, simple girl not her brothers rich daughter. Who will adorn this house with her love and affection. This house that you have nurtured with such love. The kids were so little when your sister and her husband passed away. You left your college studies incomplete to bring them up. Started with a small job. Your aim in life was to struggle for them. You never got married. Youve brought the boys up well. That is why Rajesh is respected. This year Prem topped M.B.A. l have seen a girl for Rajesh. A couple of days ago l had gone to Pune for a conference. l met Professor Choudhary there. - Siddharth Choudhary? - Do you know him? We were in college together. We were also good friends. l met his elder daughter there. Saw her once and she won my heart. l liked her so much that l brought her picture along. Her name is Pooja. She has just cleared B.A. - Theyll make a good pair. - l agree. Right now the family has gone to Ramtekri on a pilgrimage. Well go there soon as they return. The boy and girl only have to see each other. Thats the only problem. Whenever we discuss marriage he puts it off. How do we get them to meet? There is one way. Why dont we go to Ramtekri? Well select the girl as well as go on the pilgrimage! - Excellent idea! - But brother mustnt hear of this. - He has arrived. - Go on uncle! Youve returned? Quite late? What did the foreign collaborators say? Everything was discussed in detail. Now they will peruse our reports. lf everything goes as per plans, as you said itll be one of its kind. Heard? To launch you in business, hes putting up such a huge factory. Dinner is served. Wow! Sweet, savory, pudding, fried pancakes! Anything special? - Actually,... - We are very happy today. - Happy? - Weve decided to go to Ramtekri during the holidays. But uncle you wanted to go to a hill station? This place is very holy. My brother and his wife go there regularly every year. So the program is fixed. Take your new silk shirt along. - Whatever for? - Anything could happen. - What did he say? - l didnt hear. You carry on brother. Well replenish the dishes. Funny! Nobodys saying anything. What can we tell you? What well be getting. Why we are happy. Hurry up Papa. lf Mummy sees you experimenting here, shell be mad. So let her! Am l scared of her? Once she sees what lve rustled she will break her fast. - What is it? - Not me, Mummy. Furiously he said, Janak! - Sita restless and people scared... - Who broke the jar? Who broke the jar? When Ramchandra broke Lord Sivas bow... Enraged Parsuram asked who had broken it. With humility and love Lord Ram answered... Oh Lord and Master of the universe Thy humble servant did the deed. Have some shame. We have two young daughters. Whatll they think? Did l say something wrong beloved? lts beyond both of us to win against you. lf anybody can win against you its.. Good morning uncle! Naughty brat! Always enters like a storm! Papa has sent back the library books and thanked you. Your bill. Here it is. Give me the books so that l can leave. That is fine. Nisha, will you do me a favor? Will you check this bill while l return from the stores? Thanks but no mischief. Now come on! Staring away! ls this Ramnarain Lodge? Didnt read the board outside? Lost my calculation. - What is it? - Can you tell me which room Professor Choudhary has? - Why? - Because... lts private. - Understood. - What? - Stand up. - Why? - Stand up! - You dont study all year round. - What? - Oh yes! Loaf around all year and then cone during exams to increase your marks! lncrease the power of your spectacles! Just because youre the manager God knows what you think of yourself! Good Lord! lm here, sister. Youre sitting here! And Mummy has been waiting for you. - What are you doing here? - l was... - Come in. - lll have the luggage kept. You were asking for Professor Choudhary. These are his daughters, Pooja and Nisha. This is Mr. Kailashnath, your Papas friend. - Good day. - Good day. - He wants to meet professor. - Please come. Here you are. Total all done. Done? Well done. Heres your reward. Manager, check the total again. They say pretty girls can never calculate. - What did you say? - You eat chocolates?

Your uncle lost a bet to me. - What? - He had said only ld lose hair but look hes balding too! See who has come. - Hello. Recognize me? - How are you? How would he be? Hes amongst the top industrialists in the country! Really, when l read about you in the newspapers l feel very proud. lts fine. Son, you probably dont know the history about us.

Why dont you meet him once? - Go and call him. - Meaning...? Yes, go! Thanks. l should thank you. God has given me everything. The love of these children. A sprawling business.

Since afternoon youve asked me this question every 15 minutes. - Whats the matter? - Matter? lll get you tea in an earthen cup. Wait! Now tell me whats the truth? First promise not to beat or scold me. Promise? - Okay. - Liked the painting? - Yes. - Liked the colors of the painting? Like the one who made the painting? Great! We brought you here only to hear this! - Brother! Uncle! - Wait on! Brother has agreed! God day sire! Save me sister-in-law! What a garland youve brought! Even he knows that elder brothers in-laws are coming home today. And nothing will be lacking in their welcome!

Did you see that? Told me hes very angry. Wouldnt talk to anybody! And the anger evaporated seeing her photo! Have a seat. l can understand you being a heart specialist while your wife a child.

Fortunate is the man who has a sister-in-law. - Then? - The man with a sister-in-law gets double joy. Keeps an eye on the sister-in-law while he talks to his wife! - Are you listening? - Yes. Says the poet Rajesh, nectar is the cup of joy. But a sister-in-law is half a wife! - What is this? - Hes caught but he didnt take it. - How convenient! - Are you watching, judge? What secret is this? Shy of your son-in-law? Hes like your own son. Please let us hear. Shes there. So what did Anarkali say to Prince Saleem?

Swear by this friendship. lf somebody asks our address, we say we live in each others hearts. We have no other address. May our friendship be immortal. Looks like it is my turn. The pressure mounts. How silly! Your heart is tough lt cant fail so easily. Recite some hot stuff. - Hot stuff? - Another poets work. What punishment could be more beautiful for a poet? That was great! Now only Prem and Nisha remain. Lets see who wins. - Thank you very much! - You won little guy! - He cheated! - What did l do? What do l have to do? So what are you getting her to do? Make her say some dialogues. Let her sing some song. Why copy? Let her sing something original. Sing something nice. l have one complaint.

Shall we leave? lts almost time. - Cant see Kailashnath. - One minute. Let us send you off properly. But our gift? The heart is so crazy. lt expects much more than it gets.

Salute him Well done. Are you going home tomorrow? Yes, my parents miss the baby. - lll go with her. - No, l will. - No, lll go! - Well both go. - Theres a telegram for you. - For me? Read what it says. Your sister-in-law is unwell. You are called immediately. - But... - Prepare to leave. Youll get the morning bus. lll help you pack. Whom are you giving this money to? lt will help in the treatment. l know these servants well. This sickness is an excuse, a scheme to grab money! Such telegrams are sold a dime a dozen! Neither will the money return nor... lt was my job to alert you. But you may do as you please. Servants! l swear and tell you that this telegram is not false. l have been falsely accused. Because l am a small man. When did you become small? - You call me sister-in-law, dont you? - Yes. Then keep this. l am scared. lf something happens in the village..? Nothing will happen. Come with me. l am confident nothing will happen to her. go. When your sister-in-law gets well.. First of all tell her, youve found Chameli for yourself. So youre off? Why dont you come along? lll come to take you. Come on. Let me drink tea first. - Uncle its getting late. - Give baby to me once. Lallu left yesterday and youre leaving today. What will l do? That is why l say, now that the factory has begun... Get me a co-sister. Well said! What times! From today its your job to find him a bride. Whats the matter? lm going home but youre chirping? Has the weather turned magical because we talked of your marriage? Now some serious talk. Uncle has put your reins in my hand. Would sir prefer a love or an arranged marriage? Love marriage which you must arrange. Heard that son? Your uncle is two steps ahead of your Dad. Hes already found you an aunt. He approves of her. He has seen her photo, right son? Show me too. Why photo? lll show you her face. You mean your beloved is on our way? Our destination has arrived. - But where is yours? - Our destinations are the same. Not here. Come in. Sit down. Think its your own house. - Whats all this? - First read this. Mummy Papa have gone out. They will return by evening. Have something to eat. Got it! Meaning you and your madam fixed this plan earlier. What romance! - Call up your brother. - Why? Let me give him the good news. - Where are your feet? - Call up. - ls brother in? - No. Hes out on urgent work. - Leave a message. - Tell him to call here fast. Now get up. And place this necklace around Nishas neck. How can l do that? Your shy sister is not coming down. lf she wont come down, let us go up to her. Were the grooms side. Well take the bridal procession! Must be your brother. Hold the baby Nisha. Sister-in-law! Shes saying something. Fast! Do something! Whats the matter? Eat it. The one who fed you will never return now. She was heartless. Showered us with love for sometime and departed. Eat my child. - Have courage. - God knows what magic this girl had. Without her, weve forgotten how to live! Stop. How are you? Here. A miracle took place. The doctors had given up hope. Sister-in-law could not recover. But l was sure nothing would happen to her. Pooja had prayed for her. And thats what happened! She opened her eyes and smiled. l told her this is the miracle of the one who always blesses me. lll go and tell Pooja the good news. That hand is no more on our heads. Elder brother, what happened? Master! She sacrificed herself for our tears. She gave my sister-in-law the gift of life in her blessings! Ask God why He calls good people to Himself? Why? Ask Him! She was a goddess of affection. She had a bounty of love within. Even the Lord needs love. He too needs love! The baby had a right over that love that you talk of! Now what happens to him? What will happen to the baby? Answer me. Put him to bed in the crib. - Has he slept? - Trying to. He thinks his aunt is his mother. lf we are missing Pooja so much... What must Rajesh be going through? Rajesh is not well. He may not say anything but we all can see it. He is being eaten up by worries. And the reason is the babys upbringing. But what is the solution? There is one way. We must get him married again. The strange thing about life is that it never halts. The breath stops but not life. A mother is essential for a baby. Very important. l feel, find a chance and talk to him about it. Drop me to the dispensary. lll send medicines for Rajesh. He is absolutely right. Son, you neednt worry about your babys future. Listen to me and get married again. You are still young. And youll get good proposals. Why go far? Sweety is willing. Had he married her then, we wouldnt see this day! - Wife! - You be quiet. lve even talked to Sweety. She has only one condition. - A maid looks after the baby. - What? Ayah looks after him? l beg you dont give baby to a woman who doesnt know motherhood. - Dont interfere! - He is right. Your choice doesnt possess the quality of being a mother. To accept anothers child, one has to know ones culture! - Listen..! - He is right. What right! He is only abusing my niece! Who would like to rear anothers kid? Under these circumstances who will give him their daughter? l ask you will you give your daughter Nisha to Rajesh? Stop it! Thats the limit! Dont lecture me! Whats wrong in Sweetys condition? Such a big racket for one infant! - Children grow up on their own. - Wife! lts probably because of this nature of yours we dont have kids. No uncle. l cant bring a step mother for baby. All stepmothers are not bad. No, l wont remarry. Come in Professor. Rajesh refuses to get married. He is also right. How can we give away our heart to a stranger? Poojas memories are enough for baby and me. Thats true for all of us. But some day you have to get married. Today we all are here to look after him, his grandfather... But we wont always be around. You need support at every stage of life. And then bringing up a child is a big responsibility. A mother can come for baby... Who will come but snatch him away. For him such a mother will come... Who will be his own. What if Nisha comes here in place of Pooja? Nisha always talks about this place. And the baby is always with her. Prepare yourself. lf anyone can take Poojas place... lt is her sister. - Accept it brother. - The baby will get a mother. How is it possible? l thought it right and spoke to Kailashnath about Nishas match. lf Nisha goes there as a bride and Poojas house settles again... What could be better than that? Let me ask Pooja once. lf she accepts... Well get her married grandly. There should be nothing lacking from our side because she is no more. What do you want dear? Whatever you deem fit. lll call up Kailashnath. Nisha has accepted. lll call the priest and fix the wedding soon. Good day. Welcome. - All ready? - Cards too are printed. We were on our way to Ramtekri. Thought wed see the baby. - Hes with Nisha. Get him. - ln a moment. - How is Nisha? - Fine. Getting her hands hennaed. Aunt has called the baby down. Shall we take him? Yes. Carefully. See whats in my hand. Your wedding card. Read it out. By the grace of God, our daughter Nisha... ...is to wed Rajesh. What are you reading? Red properly. By the grace of God our daughter Nisha is to wed Rajesh. Please come with your family to bless the couple. - Give it to me. - Whats wrong? Uncle... You have obliged us greatly by agreeing to marry Rajesh. Youve given the gift of life to both of them. A new life. See. - What happened? - She was fine. - Open your eyes. - Call a doctor. She is absolutely fine. lve given her an injection. Shell be fine in no time. - But suddenly...? - Must be tired due to the wedding. Dont worry. lll take leave. Well also make a move. Come to me baby. l wanted to meet Nisha once. - Go up. - l dont want to disturb her. Give this to her. The step that you have taken for baby... lm grateful to you for it. Everybody is very happy with this decision. But l know every girl has some dreams, some desires. lf there is any hesitation in your mind, do tell me. Nothing matters more than your happiness. Who? Give me your grandchild. Come to uncle. Come in son. Lord! The Lord with the flute. What game are you playing? Prem has bound me by oath. Made me helpless. But you are not helpless. Lord perform some miracle... That people start believing in you again. And they have faith in you. Sister had adorned our love for each other with this necklace. She wanted her co-sister to wear it. l am returning it. Give this to Prem. Come here Rajesh. Sister had adorned our love with this necklace. She wanted her co-sister to wear it. lm returning it. What is this? Saw that Pooja? What these two set out to do? What would l answer you if this step had been taken? Whats wrong Rajesh? Why did you come upstairs? Read this and tell me if it is fair. This beloved son of yours who always asked me every little thing... ...hid such a big thing in his heart! Hid it behind his smile. Made me an outsider today! No, what you did was wrong! After Pooja passed away, l had only one desire. The baby should not miss his mother. l ask you, if you had accepted the baby as an aunt... Would your love have been reduced? Answer me. Silly girl! You were out to ruin your life and happiness. Son, you should be proud of them. They did what they thought was their duty. Now lll do my duty. Poojas incomplete dream. Actually its my fault. l couldnt understand. What you tried to tell me before departing. l have a request. Give Nishas hand to Prem.
