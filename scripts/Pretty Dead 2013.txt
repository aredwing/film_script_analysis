Because people were capable of doing all the dark things. The world had room for? I don't want to be a monster. And i don't want to be experimented on. I'm already dead already. I just need a little help lying down. [ Voice breaking ] Sorry, dad. This isn't your fault. [ Sniffles ] [ Gunshot ] [ Thud ] When we're done talking here, I'm going to have nurse boyle. Treat that infection on your face. No, i told you. Whenever i do that, It just makes it dig in further. I'm also going to take some blood from you, And we're going to do a general physical. Please, please, don't. I understand that you are afraid of what we're going to find, But i think we need to know what we're dealing with here. I am not... and i got to tell you, regina, What i think we're going to find. Is that you're suffering from schizophrenia... specifically, cotard's syndrome. And when you're wrong, what happens then? Well, either way, We need to know what's going on with you. In order to cure you. I am not schizophrenic. Okay. Would you like to know why i think you are? Why not? Your mother died at a significant age. In adolescent development. The fungus you believe that's inside of you. Is very similar to the staph infection. Which killed your mother. The drug use, the stress of becoming a doctor, And getting engaged all at the same time, Not to mention overdosing in a public restroom. These are all risk factors. Which lead to the onset of schizophrenia. Now, the nature of your situation, As you described it to me, Is very similar to the delusions found. In these kind of psychotic disorders. But i... i'm not delusional. Did a doctor confirm anything you found out about yourself? Ryan confirmed it. Ryan. He's an emt. Ryan. I'm a doctor. What, that isn't enough? We fucking videotaped it. Where's the videotape? It's... it's at my apartment or the cops have it. Schizophrenia is often associated. With delusions of persecution. You think i faked it, too. And what about the pictures the cops showed me? It's amazing, Patients suffering from cotard's syndrome, What they would do to prove to themselves. That they are, in fact, dead. It's extraordinary. [ Indistinct conversation in distance ] [ Laughs ] And here we both are on the ferris wheel. Oh. I've been on this once before, But this is ryan's first time. It's my first time. She's more experienced than me. In all things, really. [ Gasps ] is that true? No. Never. [ Chuckles ] This could be the beginning of a wonderful relationship. A little more confidence, please. I was gonna say something else, but i bit my tongue. So, this is our first time together on the... the ferris wheel, and our official first date. Did you... did you ever imagine it would be like this? I imagined it being better, actually. What?! [ Chuckles ] What... what could make it better? What? What could make it better? I don't know. After this, what are we gonna do? Um... we should... uh, we... after this, we're going to eat. Oh, are we gonna eat some scrimps? [ Gasps ] no. But i want scrimps. That's good, too. Okay, we'll do whatever you want. We'll do what you want. [ Chuckles ] well. [ Laughs ] wow. [ Rock music playing ] [ Indistinct singing ] Hey. What are you doing? You starting to get nervous? No. Starting to get nervous? Shut up! Look at her wiggling. I know. I'm trying to watch. Shut up for a minute. You... you shut up. Listen, have you noticed, but monogo... monogamy and matrimony are not natural occurrences. In the natural world? You're not a natural occurrence, either. Cooper: hey, just do it already. It's not like she's gonna say no. She's not going to say no. She wants it so bad! Quint: i'm not gonna bring this every time we have a... i didn't ask you to bring it! Move your ass. Regina, move your ass. Whoa, where are you going, dr. Stevens? It is my party, and i can pee if i want. What is wrong with you guys? Are you serious about yourselves? Dude, we're not the jackass. Who's been carrying a ring around for six fucking weeks. No, you're the jackasses trying to blow my spot. About my proposal. You fucking do it! I have something that'll help you grow a pair of balls. Joe: yeah! Quint: holy shit. That's on camera. What? Ryan: let's not... we're not gonna do that. I don't want to do that. Okay, well, you're not the only one here. Come on, we don't need to do that to have a good time, guys. We do. We are boring. [ Laughter ] That's true, that's true. Yeah. Well, you don't want to do it, there's more for me. More for me. Yeah, yeah. Don't trip over your vagina on the way to pussy town. I like pussy town. Pussy town express pulling out of the station! Population me! Ryan chairman of the board. Wait. Hold on. He's saying something really important... let me get important for a second. Okay, man. You guys can do all the drugs you want, Just calm the shit down with the proposal shit. Let me do it on my time. Dude, get the camera out of my face. So, your time would be 2014? Joe: at this rate... [ indistinct singing ] Whoo! Whoo! Are you gonna do a bump? Do a bump with us? I don't think that's a good idea. Oh, what's wrong with you guys? What is this "say no to drugs" thing? That's so, like, Are you max headroom? Seriously. When you guys are married and you have, like, A boring little house and a boring little life. With a boring picket fence. And little stupid dog that barks all the time, Then you can be boring and responsible, But right now, you need to party. You just became a fucking doctor! You're gonna save lives. You need to party! [ Dance music plays ] Cooper: Take it off! Whoo! [ Laughing ] It's okay, tinker bell. Shonda: Oh, shit. [ Chuckles ] Oh, my god, where did you get this shit? [ Sniffs ] Oh. God. Patient had it on him when we picked him up. A patient? [ Laughs ] Did you fucking steal some crackhead's shit? [ Both laugh ] okay, wait, wait. Wait, hey, did you let her steal some crackhead's shit? It wasn't a crackhead. Are you filming this? [ Chuckling ] no. I'm not filming. Are you serious? Again? Everything. I bought... i paid for this camera. I'm gonna use it. You're not gonna run for congress, shonda, so shut up. Joe: she's considering it. Do it! It's really good shit. What happened? What happened? Regina finally... uh, hey, did you loosen up? Did i miss it? No, no. She's not gonna do it. No, but seriously, like, If i'm gonna be treating people who are whacked out, Then maybe it's a good idea that i just try it. That's such a bullshit excuse. Can you stop trying to be my dad? Wait. Like, no. Please? This is my last chance to be irresponsible. Quint: oh, shit. Look at this shit. Hey, seriously, quint. It may not be the best idea to film the illegal actmties. Come on. You guys suck. [ Sniffles ] Regina: seriously, you put that thing away. And sing something. I don't... your nose is bleeding. Shit. Yeah, shit. You all right? [ Indistinct singing ] Whoa, whoa. Hey, you okay? You do not look so good, sweetie. All right, you need to go to the bathroom. Oh, shit. Go to the bathroom. [ Chuckling ] danny boy the pipes, the pipes are calling You guys are terrible irish... no, we're not. You're not irish. I'm the most irish of all... [ knock on door ] Uh, your friend is passed out. In front of the bathroom, vomiting. I think it's time y'all get the fuck out of here. Why did you have to give her that shit? I told you not to... hey! Lower your voice. Screw you. She could be o. D.'Ing. Ryan: Uh, hey, Cooper, it's ryan. Um, i'm at the hospital still. [ Sighs ] I guess we're responsible adults now. Here we are, responsible adults. I don't want to really talk about it, but, uh, The important thing is regina's gonna be okay. There were complications, And nobody here can really explain what happened... some kind of freak blood allergy, i don't know. But she's pulled through, thank god, and she isn't like... seems like she's gonna be all right. I'm just really tired and i want to go home, So i'm just gonna stay here until she's... they're ready to release her, And um, i don't want to talk about it, I don't want to know where you got that stuff. It's not important right now. What's important is that she's okay, And i'm gonna take her home. [ Guitar playing ] Want to hear the song i wrote for you? Regina: yes. [ Guitar plays ] About doctor/emt love. [ Chuckles ] I wrote... you know this, but it's a little complicated. Two people trying to save lives. [ Sighs ] Have a relationship together. [ Laughs ] If you don't know. Goes a little something like this. love is an oddity between a doctor and an emt [ Laughing ] oh, my god. when she's taking off her scrubs Ooh. i'm putting on my rubber gloves and though she thinks i'm a dope No. she looks sexy in a stethoscope [ Laughs ] why, thank you. and i can't wait to see her later 'cause i know i can defibrillate her [ Laughs ] somebody call 911 'cause i got an emergency Ooh. i'm in love with a beautiful girl and she wants to become an md I... No, keep going. Don't stop. [ Laughs ] [ Ryan vocalizing "wedding march" ] Who is this gorgeous girl in my bed? It's my soon-To-Be wife. Yeah, let's make this happen. Baby? Sleepyhead? Sleepy toes? Time to get up. Time to get up. Baby. I have a little surprise for you. Baby, i feel like crap. Baby, just open your eyes. Just let me sleep until i go to the hospital, okay? But baby. Baby. Come on. You want to sleep? You want to sleep forever? [ Chuckling ] mm-Hmm. How come? It's time to get up. I have a big... [ smooches ] I have a big surprise for you.

No, we just bought it. Seriously, babe, taste it. Well, baby, just come sit down. I'll cook you whatever you want. You have time? I need something that's fast. You want yogurt? Yeah. Okay, i'll get you a bowl. Ew, is that this? [ Sniffs ] ew! That is... i just bought that. It's fine, baby. It's fine. You know what's really good? The fruit. The fruit is really fresh. I bought it today. Would you like some fruit? Just have a seat. Have a little seat over here. This is actually... that's raw bacon. I don't know why, i just... no. You can't... are you just gonna eat raw bacon? It's good. Have you had raw bacon? [ Chuckling ] no. I've never had raw bacon. Regina stevens, despite the fact. That you're eating raw bacon, i love you more than anybody. [ Muffled ] i love you, too. Shit, i got to go. I love you. I lo... okay. Regina! Regina, come here real fast. I just have something to show you. Just something to show you real fast. [ Door opens, closes ] Babe? That did not go as planned. Guess i should've put it in the fucking bacon. [ Sighs ] [ Door opens ] I totally forgot my... What is that? [ Chuckles ] Really? Let me... yes. Let me do it. Let me do it. Yes, oh, my god. You've been trying to do that all morning. [ Chuckling ] yeah. Little bit. Regina stevens. [ Chuckles ] Will you shut your mouth, And will you do me the honor of being my wife? [ Voice breaking ] yeah. [ Sniffles, whimpers ] [ Chuckles ] [ Both laugh ] [ Chuckles ] [ Laughing ] stop. Ah, fuck! What the fuck, reggie. Damn. Oh, my. Oh, my god. You bit the fuck out of my tit. Oh, my god. Oh, my god, you almost got my nipple! I don't know what happened. [ Chuckles ] are you serious? Jesus. Looks really bad. Oh, i think it's... it looks worse than it is. I'm so sorry. No, it's fine. It's fine. I appreciate the enthusiasm, But jesus christ, you got to watch those chompers. Oh, god. I'm sorry. I... i know, i know. It's fine. I'll have cooper look at it. I'll get cooper to clean it up. [ Chuckling ] it's fine. You don't look fine. I know. I'm fine. Just go to work. We'll continue this later, Hopefully a little less violently, And it'll be fine, all right? I love you. You have blood... oh, we got to get that off. All right? Go to work. I'm serious. Go. Ah. Are you sure you're okay? Babe, i swear. Listen, go. Go to work. I love you, fiance. Be out in a second. Okay? [ Chuckles ] Okay, go. [ Sighs ] damn. [ Door opens, closes ] I know. The day that ryan proposed, i was halfway through rounds. And i had to excuse myself. Because of how loudly my stomach was growling. I was so hungry. I'd... never been hungry like that before. And everything i tried to eat just tasted rotten. This girl came into the stall next to mine. I was in there, hiding, Trying to figure out what was wrong with me. She changed out her tampon, and the smell of blood... anyway, and i don't remember leaving my stall. Or digging through the trash, but the next thing i know, I'm sucking the blood out of this thing. Like it's a fucking popsicle, and... instead of being completely disgusted by what i was doing, I was finally eating something that tasted right. Doctor: nobody knew you were doing this? I was an intern. Getting access to human tissue was easy. It was kind of like stealing pens from the office. Ryan, obviously, didn't see it that way at first, But it wasn't hurting anybody, and after enough convincing, Even though it grossed him out, he really loved me. That was enough. At least for a while. Look, i... i thought the crazy cravings were under control. I mean, shit, i thought it was gonna be a medical breakthrough. Ryan: uh, hey, babe, There's a bunch of biohazard bags in the refrigerator. Um, i don't know what's going on. I don't... i'd like you to explain this. 'Cause i can't eat anything in the fridge. 'Cause it really reeks, and i know you know. That thanksgiving is coming up, So i was gonna do some shopping, so give me a call. We need to talk about this. your bio-Waste shake brings the boys to the yard you love to drink human lard i'm going to blow my chunks Oh, this one's female body fat. Mmm. What's that? Is female body fat lighter than regular body fat? Is what? Is it lighter? Is it, like, diet body fat? Are you worried at all about the fat calories in the fat? Are you calling me fat? No, i think you're perfect, but i ha... what... i have to wonder what the consequences are. Of drinking a fat shake are. [ Smacks lips ] ahh. [ Laughs ] I'm not gonna... to got to... i can't kiss you after that. What? No. What? No. Dude, gross. What? Gross. Okay. No, i don't. I'm not... you love it. All right. All right. Maybe... maybe brush your teeth first. [ Chuckles ] I don't even... i don't even remember biting him. Or doing any of the other shit they said i did. And i'm not... i'm not saying i didn't do it. I know i did it. I just... i black out... or something. Is it possible that you don't want to remember? Okay. So, i've decided to document this research. Um, here are the facts that we have so far. One... food makes me completely sick. Can't eat it unless it's pork, and it has to be raw. Ryan: which kind of makes sense. 'Cause pork is the closest to human flesh. Right. Or human... i can eat human tissue, Blood, fat, and that kind of stuff, I cannot seem to get enough of. Two... i can't sleep. I haven't slept in 10 days, And it's been forever since i've felt tired in that way. Three... my blood pressure and my, um, my pulse. Are significantly lower than they ever have been, And there seems to be some correlation. Between how recently i've ingested human tissue. And how low those levels actually go. So, today, we're going to test for, um... do some blood and test for anomalies. You left out the best part. Tell them about your finger. Oh, right, okay. Um, so, my finger... i cut it a couple days ago, And it seems to be... it's healed extremely quickly. You can look. There's not even really anything there. The hypothesis is... [ chuckles ] ...is that my fiance is a mutant. [ Chuckling ] no. No, the hypothesis. Is that there seems to be something new in my blood. That's accelerating the healing process. Yeah, just as long. As you don't mind cannibalizing human remains. Well, yeah, but that's how it is right now. I mean, once we understand this a little bit better, We'll be able to find a substitute for the human flesh. I'm sure of it. Yeah, sure. I mean, they have tofurkey. I'm sure that human-Flesh substitute. Is just around the corner. Yeah, i thought you were gonna help and not mock. I'm sorry. Just how i cope. No, but really. I mean, imagine a world. Where, you know, patients can go home. The same day that they've had open-Heart surgery, Or they don't even need open-Heart surgery. I mean, this could really change everything. [ Dramatically ] imagine a world. Where patients are fed human remains by their doctors. Get the blood stuff. Okay, uh, we are gonna do a little experiment. I am going to make an incision into regina's hand, And we're gonna see what happens. I don't... i don't think i can do this. Babe, we talked about this, okay? It's gonna be fine. Don't worry. You're sure? Yes. Okay. Thank you. Okay over here? Yeah. Can i get you anything? No, i'm good. Another glass of fat shake? I'm okay. Thank you. Four hours. Totally healed. That's pretty damn fast. You okay? If my mom would've been able to do that... okay. Welcome to regina and ryan's science show, Starring regina and ryan, the science couple. Serious. Okay. Um, so, as we suspected, There appears to be something in my blood, Which i'm gonna show you right now. This is an image from a regular microscope. And as you can see, there appears to be a symbiotic... sorry... relationship between my cells, Which are over here, and then the fungus, Which is right here. And this is the same image. From an electron microscope at 100,000. Oh, gross. Look at that. That's inside you. We think that it's possible that this very fungus. Is chemically influencing regina's behavior. It's not making me do anything. Well, you're a lot smarter than an ant, babe. What are you talking about? Don't you remember when we saw that tv show. About the ant that goes all crazy. And it runs on top of the bean stalk. And it gets that thing that grows out of its head. Like a big ant... boner? [ Chuckles ] And it shoots all that stuff. Wait, you think the fungus is controlling my brain? It's a very simpical... [ chuckles ] simple. It's very simple... oh, it's a very what? It's a very simple chemical process to trigger hunger. It's a very... no, it is. It's a very simple chemical process to trigger hunger. You know that. But then that would mean that... i mean, we would have to test you. Because that means you could be... no, it's fine. I'm fine. I already did. I'm fine. Just... don't bite me again. I thought you thought this was cool. I do. I think it's really cool. It's awesome. It's frickin' amazing. I want to learn all about it, But i just don't really want to eat people. Narrator: these common black ants, Known as monomorium minimum to entomologists, Are one of the most common ant species in the world. Colonies can contain over 2,000 workers per queen. But this one here is exhibiting some odd behaviors. It has been infected by a parasitic fungus. Known as cordyceps. This remarkable fungus infects both the body of a host, As well as its mind. As the fungus begins to take control, The ants exhibit periods of intense aggression. And disorientation until finally, The cordyceps wins control of its victim's mind. And compels it upwards towards the light of the sun. Once the ant has expended the last of its energies. Moving to the highest possible point, The fungus directs the ant. To anchor itself with its powerful jaws. If the infected host cannot be isolated from the colony. Or the other workers, The consequences will be catastrophic. This is the reason why, over the next few weeks, The fruiting body of the cordyceps fungus. Will emerge from the host and spore. The millions of spores erupting from a single contaminated ant. Can infect an entire colony in a matter of days. Strangely, while there are thousands of species. Of cordyceps fungi, Each one is genetically specific. And can only infect and control a single species of insect. As devastating as these attacks may be. To the population of the colony, They are of vital importance to the overall ecosystem, As they prevent any one species from becoming too successful. And upsetting the fragile natural balance. The greater the population of a particular species, The greater the chance a cordyceps fungus will evolve. And keep it in check. No, 'cause you know, it's possible, though, That you were abducted when we were asleep, And aliens from another universe. Came down and put a little alien embryo inside you, And that's what's making you want to eat all this stuff. It's a possibility. Mm-Hmm. I mean, you know, like... that's why i'm a doctor and you're just an emt. You know, like, symbiotic relationships, And that's... weren't you talking about that? No... yes. All i was saying was that cordyceps. Don't normally have symbiotic relationships. With their hosts. Yeah, but... so, it would be weird if, in this case... but up until now, weren't you saying. That their hosts have been ants and beetles, And so... and we haven't even conformed... confirmed... [ chuckling ] conformed. Confirmed that it's a cordyshlap or whatever it is. Yeah, but it's making me want to eat people. Exactly. That's how you know it's not a parasite. 'Cause if it was just using you to incubate the spore, Then we'd be fighting to keep you off of rooftops. Instead of spending a romantic evening... no, but rooftops wouldn't be so bad right now. Don't. Come on. Don't talk like that. [ Chuckles ] You know, i'm not... i'm not gonna let anything bad happen to you. You promise? I promise. [ Chuckles ] you hesitated. [ Both laugh ] I promise. I cross my heart. I hope to die. But don't eat me if i die. [ Sighs ] Ryan, i think we should get a gun. What are you talking about? I think, just in case, I think it would be smart for us to get... just in case of what? We don't need a gun for anything. That's... that's just stupid. Ryan, seriously, we need to have a failsafe. We don't need a failsafe. I'm not getting a gun. No guns. End of discussion. I don't know why you're being so final about this. We're getting a gun. Because we don't need a gun and we're not getting a gun! We're getting a gun. When my mom died, um... i, um, i just kept everything in. And eventually, i, uh, felt... so cold and alone... that i just kind of went numb... to everything. Until i... until i met... [ voice breaking ] until i met ryan. Um, but then, you know, he started pulling away, And... i knew it was just... things had gotten too far out of hand. I knew it was too late to get help. [ Gun clicks ] It's tripped. Ha. Quint: jesus. I got it. That's why we do not need a gun. We just don't need one that... that's big. That the... [ sighs ] We just don't need one that big. We can get a smaller one. Come on. Regina: this is for your protection. I don't need protection because i'm not gonna do it. Ryan, we need to have a failsafe, honey, okay? If i get out of control, then we're gonna be... if we need a failsafe, honey, Then it's already out of control. Just let me take you to the hospital. You have friends there, they'll look after you, They're not gonna do anything you don't want them to do. The new diet, uh, doesn't seem to be as effective, And it's not really satiating the cravings, So in the event that... in the event that she loses control, She wants me to shoot her in the fucking face. Do i have that right? Yeah, so, that's not gonna happen. We're gonna go to the hospital. Where she can be looked at professionally. Ryan, i don't need to go to the hospital. I'm fine. I just need a little bit of time. To figure out a combination of things that'll... [ sighs ] ...that'll stop the cravings. Do you? You sound like a crazy person, you know that? Funny. No, it's not funny. I don't want to talk about this anymore. Fine, but then will you at least come in and buy it with me? Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, If ryan shoots me with this gun, Know that it's because i asked him to, And, um, he's not a killer. He's great, actually. Let's go to the hospital. We can go right now. Ryan, i need this to feel safe. Okay, i need to know that somebody has my back, or... [ sighs ] Fine, i'll... i'll go in with you. But the only thing i'm using that gun for. Is to knock your dumb ass out and drag you to the hospital. You wouldn't do that to me. You don't think i would? Really? You don't think i would? Just tell me. Tell me, how is that not different? How is... how is that not better? You're already experimenting on yourself, So how is it not better just going to the hospital. Than me shooting you in the face? Tell me. Just tell me. [ Sighs ] That's what i thought. [ Chatter ] Man: all right, this one's good. Don't. Don't. Got it? Yeah. All right. I can go? Yeah. Oh, there you go. Yeah. I think that's the one i want. That's the one you want? Yeah. Okay. [ Gun clicks ] That's it. All right. We can do that. Ryan: uh, hey, um, i'm... in this seminar in san diego Cooper told me about. I'm gonna go. Um, i know you're having a tough time right now. And that you probably wanted to kill me. For not being there for you, but, um, I can only be where i'm at, and i... i mean, you asked me to shoot you, regina. What... what am i supposed to do with that? [ Sighs ] Whatever signals the fungus in my brain is triggering. Are getting stronger, And... i'm starting to get a little scared. Ryan is freaking out. I mean, he's my partner in all of this. I've tried to use anti-Fungals to counteract, But they only make it worse, And they make me hungrier almost instantly, Which is a problem. Tomorrow is virg's birthday party, And... i mean, i probably shouldn't go, but if i don't, She's gonna fucking kill me. I...wish that i could tell her. Anyway, um, the point of this. Is to show you the latest development, So let's just get to it. Okay. No wonder ryan's making every excuse not to come home. You know, i don't even think i can have kids anymore. I don't think my biological clock's even ticking. I mean, if i could have kids, what'd come out of me, you know? Snack time at daycare would take on a whole new meaning. Were you afraid you might infect your goddaughter? There, see? That's what you have to look forward to. You get pregnant, and you can have your own pair of these. Woman: [ laughs ] mm-Hmm. Okay, i would take these if that meant... oh, you wish you were pregnant, don't you? [ Indistinct conversation, laughter ] Oh. Here, you want to come sit with us? Is that your doggy? [ Squealing ] [ Laughter ] Jesse: uh, a little bit small, but... look at... look at mommy's new slippers. Look at... look at these. [ Laughter ] What do you think? Be honest. Uncle ryan got them for her. For mommy. Mm-Hmm. [ Laughter ] Whoo. [ Laughs ] He wanted to say hi. Hey, bruce. Quint: shonda. Yo. Do you have a birthday wish for virginia? Yes, i do. And what is that? Okay, and it is not that. Come on. I am taking over this camera... ridiculous. ...'cause you are now banished, and i am moving over here. Hello, miss regina. Do you have a birthday wish for our lovely girl? Um, hi, virginia. Happy birthday. I'm... oh, are you okay? Whoa. Yeah. Yeah, i'm fine. Wait, wait, wait, wait. Are you done, or... i'm confused. Are... can you catch it? Where are you going? Hello? Hey, shonda. What's happening? Do you have a birthday wish. For this lovely lady standing next to you? Which one? Where's the lovely lady? Oh, that's kind of heartless. That's nice. Are there some coming? That's really nice, right? What? Who did you invite? [ Laughter ] god, you're such an ass. No, no, no, no. You know we love you. Well, then... his simon & garfunkel chicken... yeah, see? ...Was my secret birthday wish. You know, anyone with an album, Put a bunch of ingredients, any stuff on them. So, some rosemary, some sage, some thyme, some... [ dog barking, child screaming ] What is it? Whoa! Quint: give me the camera. Give me the camera. Get in the car. Get in the car, jesse. Should i call 911? Regina: i can't believe i blamed it on the dog. [ Chuckles ] The truth is... this thing... is ugly and disgusting. And i wish that i could... turn my body inside out and scrub it off. It's there all the time. I can't even sleep for, like, five minutes. I haven't slept in two months. We can fix that, reggie. Why haven't you told me that you haven't been sleeping? [ Scoffs ] what's the point? Just let me die before... before something bad happens. That's not what we do here, reggie. Well, what... what do you do here? What is any of this supposed to be doing? We will diagnose your condition, treat you accordingly, And with any luck, get you back to feeling normal again. [ Chuckling ] normal. Nor-Normal? Like what? Like, there's, like... you're gonna cure me? What kind of cure is there for the things i've done? So... i'm just trying to remain in control here. Working off the theory that if i can lessen. The amount of fungus inside me. Or kill it, Then i might be able to stop the cravings and symptoms, Um, hopefully, completely. Uh, i've made a batch of... kill juice. It's, uh, three parts lotrimin and one part bleach. Lotrimin is, uh, one of the best imidazoles out there, And, uh, if anything's gonna stop this thing. From reproducing, this is it. And bleach... i mean, bleach kills everything, So... i'm hoping that between the two, I'll be able to weaken or... stop. The fungus' hold on me. The only question is... ...what will happen to me if the fungus is killed, 'Cause i'm already not registering a pulse, And there's really no sign of blood pressure. Um... and, you know, i feel pretty dead already, So... if that's what's happening, Then... i might as well just make it official. [ Sniffs ] [ Chuckles ] Don't try this at home. [ Gulps ] [ Gasps ] [ Sniffs ] [ Shuddering ] [ Sniffs ] [ Knock on door ] You order pizza? There's no numbers on your door. Hello? Great, a fucking zombie. Listen, do you have $28.17? Ryan: oh, my god. Regina: put the camera down, ryan. Oh, my god. What did you do? Give me the goddamn camera. I would've brought you a fat shake. I didn't know you were out. Is this what you do when i'm not here? You just eat pizza guys? Is that... it must've taken over, because i-I didn't do this. This is bad. This is real bad. I swear, i didn't do this. I'm sorry. I've got to take control. I woke up and... and there was blood everywhere... i got some bleach in... under the sink. ...and he was dead. I was trying to kill it, and... and it... it fought back. I don't... well, how did you get him in there? You can't... you can't film this. It... give me the camera. I just really need to... stop it. I need to record this. You killed somebody. Yeah, well, you were supposed to be the one. To stop that from happening, okay? And you flaked on me, and now i need your help. No, no, this is not my fault. I can't help you with this. I can't deal... ryan, ryan, i will go to jail forever. Look what you fucking did. I know. I didn't do it on purpose, okay? You know that. I know you're out of control. Obviously i'm out of control, okay? We know. We talked about this. We had a deal, okay? You know what you have to do. No, no, i don't... what i need to do. Is call the police because you... you need help. You're... you're fucking crazy. You're... you're... i'm a monster, ryan. Baby. Baby, you're not a monster. You're not a monster. You just need some help, okay? This has gone too far, you know. You've got something inside you. We need to... we can get you some help and we can... listen, there's got to be something we can do. There's got to be somebody who can help you. Wait, may... maybe there's still time. You're killing people, baby. Not people. Just one person. Are you fucking kidding me?! Are you listening to yourself?! I can't do this. I know you're scared, 'cause i'm scared fucking shitless, But i... i don't feel safe around you anymore. You are not safe to be around. Ryan, you cannot leave me behind. You cannot leave me behind. I have to. I have to leave. You have to go to a hospital. You have to get some help. No, we... we can't go to a hospital. They're gonna te... test... i'm done. No. I'm done. You're on your own. You cannot do this to me, ryan. Don't leave me, you asshole! [ Door slams ] [ crying ] Um, maybe my dad, but i know what i saw. Schizophrenia is often associated. With delusions of persecution. Paranoia. Paranoia? How am i paranoid? Because i... i don't want to be some lab rat? Because i'm hurting people, so i stay away from them? That's not paranoia. That's common sense. Patients with schizophrenia often experience losses of time. Where they black out and they come to, And they don't know how they got. To where they are or what they've done. Or where they've been. And you've explained to me that you have blacked out. Half the kids on campus have drank too much. And blacked out at one point or another. Does that make all of them schizophrenic? Were you drinking before your loss of time, regina? Look, i wish i was schizophrenic. You know, give me a pill... poof... all this goes away, But that's not what's going on here. It... the mind is a very, very powerful thing, regina. Do you remember what happened after, regina... between the time when you pulled the trigger. And woke up? Hey, dad. Remember when mom told me that monsters were just in my head? That the world didn't need. Vampires and werewolves and zombies, Because people were capable of doing. All the dark things the world had room for? I know what it's like. To have something eat you alive from the inside, And i know that if i don't eat, i'll be eaten, Or worse, it'll spore, and... this is the last chapter of this investigation. The big medical breakthrough i thought this was. Turned out to be a lot simpler than i thought. You know, murder, i-I get it. I can come up with a thousand reasons... i didn't mean to do... to do it. I don't want to be a monster. And i don't want to be experimented on. I'm already dead already. I just need a little help lying down. I just... [ sighs ] i can't explain it. You're not gonna believe me anyway. Try me. It couldn't hurt, right? [ Sighs ] okay. If i don't ingest human tissue, The symbiotic fungal parasite in my body. Will spore and infect. Who knows how many other people. [ Door unlocks ] Shit. Ryan, don't you fucking come in here. I just want to talk, okay? Just want to talk. Thought maybe you'd have checked yourself in. Look at me. I can't go out like this. I don't trust myself to be around people. That's why you need to turn yourself in. You can't... just keep hiding in here. And hope that this is gonna go away, 'cause it's not. Let me look here. Honey, you've got to get... yeah, it hasn't spored yet, If that's what you're worried about. It isn't. When it finally spores, i doubt you'll still be... yeah, well, that's why i'm not gonna let it get that far. Good, then let me take you somewhere right now. And he... he didn't... this? Why would you do this? [ Sighs ] Of course not. I was dead. [ Sniffs ] Plus, i'm sure he didn't want to implicate himself. [ Sighs ] [ Sniffles ] Ryan. You know, with the pizza guy, that wasn't me. [ Sighs ] When i came to, he was there. And... i mean, i didn't know what happened. Well, i knew what happened, but... and i think i blacked out. When i didn't respond to the hunger cues, But it's not me. It's what's inside me. You know that, right? [ Scoffs ] doesn't even matter. You checked out of this relationship. As soon as this crap starts showing up on my face. That's not true. Really? I'm afraid of you, regina. You killed somebody. Please, you stopped coming home long before that happened. What did you want me to do? Help you steal body parts and blend them up. And write you poetry about how you have a fungus inside you... a fungus that can be contagious at any second? I'm not a bad person for being weirded out by this. No, you are a bad person. For ditching me when i needed you most. You're out of control, and i get that you're pissed off. But let me get you help. I'm gonna go in the bedroom, And i'm gonna pack you a bag. And i'm gonna take you. To the police station or the hospital... but you can choose. It's too late for that. Whoa, whoa. So, you killed and ate the pizza-Delivery guy? That's not... that's not what ryan told you? [ Door closes ] Sorry, dad. This isn't your fault. [ Sniffles ] [ Voice breaking ] i want to see ryan. I get a phone call. I want to see ryan. Ryan: reggie?! Jesus christ. [ Telephone beeping ] [ Telephone ringing ] Oh, babe, what did you do? What did you do? Oh, please. Just hold on. Just hold on. Come on. Man: 911, what's your emergency? I'm am emt. I have a 24-Year-Old female. With a self-Inflicted gsw to the head. She's in full arrest. I'm at 1915 maple street. Is that an apartment or a house? It's an apartment. I have you at 1915 west maple... no, it's north maple street. It's in westwood. 1915 maple street in westwood. Got it. She's not breathing and you confirmed she has no pulse? Yes, correct. Go ahead and start cpr if you haven't already. Police are en route, but paramedics will have to stage. Please, just... just hurry. What the... [ grunting ] no! Wait. Okay, we've got regina stevens. Caucasian female, 24 years old. Cause of death still undetermined, Though it's probably not from this apparent gunshot wound. Just over the left mandible. It's 8:07 p.M., And i'm gonna go ahead and make the first incision. [ Gasps ] Fuck! [ Panting ] Are... are you okay? Don't say anything else, honey. John's on his way. [ Voice breaking ] no, i-I don't need a lawyer. I don't need anything, okay? I just... i don't... i don't want to do anything. Is this bruising? What the hell's wrong with you people? Okay, before you go off the deep end there, mr. Stevens, You should know that your daughter. Has just confessed to two extremely brutal murders. I can't explain it. This is a mistake. It's not a mistake. [ Sobbing ] i'm so sorry. Don't, please. I'm dangerous, okay? You have to stay away from me. I don't want to hurt you, too. Dad. I'm sorry. What's the truth, regina? What happened the night you say you died? but got me back. Shit. Yeah, shit. You all right? when summer's. Hey, whoa, whoa, hey. You okay? Joe: you do not look so good, sweetie. Shonda: oh, shit. All right, you need to go to the bathroom. Go to the bathroom. [ Indistinct shouting ] Regina: it had to be something in the cocaine. I-I don't know what else it could've been. But it could've easily been contaminated. Dr. Romera: why didn't any of your friends get infected? You were the only one who got sick. I don't know. Maybe i'm unique somehow. Cordyceps bond to genetically specific hosts. Maybe my immune system was off while my heart was stopped. I mean, maybe when ryan continued. To pump the infected blood through my system. While doing cpr... yeah, maybe that's what allowed it to take hold. I mean, i was the only one who died that night, With it still in my bloodstream. You know, that's why it would only affect me. And not anybody else. [ Indistinct shouting ] Ryan brought me back, but it was too late. I died that night. I've been dead ever since, And everything i try to do to fix myself. Just makes things worse. Get that fucking thing out of my face! [ Panting ] Halt compressions. I feel something. Regina! Regina! Fuck. Turn her. Turn her. Joe: oh, fuck. Shonda: oh, regina. Oh, my god. Oh, my god. Turn. Regina: i can feel it in me. You have no idea how hungry i am right now. Is she awake? I don't want to hurt people anymore. You're not safe. Nobody is safe as long as i'm alive. One, two, three. It would be easy to prove what you say is true. If we do a physical. And send a blood sample to the cdc. [ Sighs ] I, uh, think this might be broken. It's not broken. Dr. Romera: i'll look at it in a second. [ Sighs ] Doc, i can't find a pulse. Doc. Just treat her face. I'll do the vitals myself. This isn't gonna hurt, okay? Okay. Just gonna... put this on you, okay? [ Gasps ] Okay. Jesus. I've never seen anything like this. How much haldol did you give her? Boyle: given her 25 milligrams. I didn't want to give her any more. And no response? No. And the thorazine? It had no effect on her the whole week either, huh? Nope. [ Growling ] All right, let's give her another 5 haldol. And start on lorazepam, 2 milligrams every 10 minutes. You're not concerned about putting her in a coma? What i am concerned about, nurse boyle, Is that my patient is out of control. And she may be a danger to herself. That is the only thing i'm concerned about. Hi, this is georgina boyle... again. I'm a nurse at linda vista, and i'm following up. On blood sample reference code charlie delta lima 457. We have reason to believe. A biological agent may be involved, So we really need to know if there's a risk of infection. And what precautions we need to be taking. Can somebody please contact me as soon as possible? Thank you. Regina? Can you hear me? She's... she's... the patient remains in an... [ screams ] [ Flatline ] [ Theme plays ] Good morning. Hazmat crews and center for disease control officials. Have sealed off the linda vista community hospital. In boyle heights. There's still no official word regarding conditions inside. However, sources are telling us. That the sudden death of one of the patients. May be the reason for the lockdown. Kcdl's ethan hawley is live on the scene in boyle heights. Ethan, what can you tell us about what's going on there? Thanks, sally. Uh, what we're hearing now. Is that there are as many as 75 hospital employees. Still trapped inside right now. That's the latest number we've got. The police department is telling us. That it all started around 5:00 a.M. This morning. With the death of a patient named regina stevens. From what they're calling an unknown biological contagion. The center for disease control is here on site. They've locked down the building. They're doing their best to stop. Any potential spread to the surrounding community, And i've actually been in contact. With one of the nurses who's still in there right now. Her name is georgina. She's telling us. That the building is hot as can be inside. Whether that's related. To attempting to contain the contagion or not, We can't really say at this point. But because they're uncertain. As to whether the pathogen's spread, The cdc is asking that anyone at home. Exhibiting flu-Like symptoms, Please contact the california health department immediately. Uh, do not go to a hospital. They're emphasizing that. Please contact them, and they will come to you. But that's... that's really all we know right now. I'm gonna try to find out more for you, But for now, i'll send it back to you, sally. [ Thumping ] Man: Right there. Right there. Right there. Oh, my goodness. Oh, what in the world... Holy... Holy crap. What the... what the hell is she... Hold up.
