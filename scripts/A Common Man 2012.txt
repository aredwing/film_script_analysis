I ask only one person. He would have to death. Compare the alternatives. This is a good bargain. Why are these four so many terrorists? These four held a lottery happiness. Do not you dare to tell your name? - Do not worry about it. You should have to destroy these creatures after the attacks. Sessions were several but did not do anything.

Religion? There is... This is not about religion. Gopinath was a Hindu. Murderer. I killed him. So am I a Muslim? Sarath Master, a Buddhist. Thousands killer. I killed him. Does that make me a Christian? You may argue religions attributed unsuspecting people. It is up to you. You can push out the lies on TV and brainwash the gullible. Do not join together by me to any group. I am an ordinary citizen, which went into action. Maybe I'm just a Christian or a Buddhist. Communist or an atheist. Do not we have the right to get angry? Right to say that enough is enough. This is not about race, religion or politics, . You'll need to know that the people will be angry. Do not tempt the patience. I do not know what you're trying to prove, but you will not succeed. I'll find you. I have already succeeded, Mr. AP. I got your attention. Tell me something. Someone close to you he dead in bomb attacks? Why should I wait that anyone close die? I'll tell you one thing. There was someone on the train. Approximately twenty-something man.

Wagons full of the unknown. What does it matter who I am? When you leave home, may not be able to return. When the children go to school, not be able to see them ever again. Akthul, Gopinath and Sarath may be a crossroads - bomb. He will blow your dreams. They kill anyone. Terrorism must be crushed as soon as it starts. You behave like a crazy terrorist. Let me explain. If they killed 300 - 400 people - you expect the court. I'll kill four terrorists, and you are panicking. I do not blame you. You decided that we need to wait for court action. Too little, too late. Am I crazy? Perhaps, perhaps, perhaps. Three bombs explode at exactly six. The clock is ticking. You run out of time. Officer Mohideen, you decide whether this is the last call.
