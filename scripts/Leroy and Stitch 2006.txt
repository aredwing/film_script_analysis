Today the Galactic Council assembles to honor Lilo and Stitch, who have successfully captured all 625 of Jumba's genetic experiments, turned them from bad to good, and found each a place where it can belong. [applause] To recognize the completion of their task, the Galactic Council has elected to bestow the following rewards... [gasps] You hear that, Jumba? We're gonna get prizes. Dr. Jumba Jookiba, we hereby return the confiscated key to your laboratory. Hah! With old lab back, evil possibilities are infinite! Agent Wendy Pleakley... [snores] ...we hereby offer you the chair of Earth Studies at the GACC. Ohh. Galactic Alliance Community College? Yes! As for Stitch, you are hereby offered a commission as captain of the Galactic Armada and commander of its new flagship the BRB-9000. Ooh. BRB. What's BRB stand for? Big Red Battleship! Ah-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha! Finally, Lilo Pelekai, you shall become our first Earth ambassador and return to Kauai to be the experiments' sole caretaker. [applause] You mean Jumba and Pleakley and Stitch aren't coming home? Stitch wants to come back to Kauai. Right, Stitch? Oh, uh, Kauai. Yeah. Maybe everybody wants to go back? - Right. Of course. - What? Don't you have something to say? Oh, yeah, right. I'm wishing to go back to stinky water planet and share bunk bed with bossy one-eyed noodle. Is this your final decision? [all] Um... - Eeh. - Absolutely. I suppose. Or maybe... Then so be it. [electricity crackles] # Aloha # Ohana [foghorn bellows] [Lilo] Now that we're done catching experiments, we can do whatever we want. I want to finish my logbook. It's got a picture of every experiment, in the one place they belong. What do you want to do, Stitch? Hmm... [hums] - [grunts] - [pipe creaks] And, uh... Huh? - [rustling] - [Stitch muttering] Ee-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha! [imitates jets roaring] Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha! [gibberish] Scale model of Big Red Battleship. Impressive. [microwave beeps] Where are you taking the microwave? Hah! Without evil genius lab, Jumba must energize genetic experiments with primitive Earth popcorn maker. You know, the microwave oven was invented by Dr. Percy Spencer. Ah, who cares? If you were a student at GACC you'd care 'cause it would be on the final exam. And what do we call this, class? Breakfast? Specifically, grain-based flakes immersed in bovine gland extract. Eww! I'm off to work. Oh, Pleakley. I need you to fix Lilo's skirt for hula class. Only if you answer this extra credit question correctly. Where did the native Hawaiian hula dance originate? - Uh, Hawaii? - Very good, Nani! If you were attending GACC, I'd move you to the head of the class. - [imitates jets roaring] - [crash] [turbine backfires] [Gantu] Blitznak! Without the reserve engines, this ship is stupid and useless. - Just like you. - [sighs] Who am I kidding? You're right. I couldn't hold on to a single one of those experiments. You still got me, your faithful sandwich-making pal. Yes. I noticed the little Earth girl never captured you. I guessed the one place I belonged was with my blubber-butt buddy Gantu. Maybe that was my problem all along. What? Your blubber butt? [chuckles] Gantu? So, we're taking the old two-man shuttle, huh? Heh-heh. Hey, you want I should fix a picnic lunch for the trip? There's only room for two on the two-man shuttle, me and Dr. Hamsterviel. - I'm breaking him out of prison. - What? This is my last chance to redeem myself. If I succeed, my future is secured. What about my future? How am I supposed to pay the bills? Why not make sandwiches? It's all that you're good at. - Maybe I will! - Fine. You're gonna miss my egg salad! Not enough mayonnaise and too much dill weed. What did you call me? - [generator starts] - [beep] - [crackling] - [beeps] Aagh! Primitive Earth science. Jumba... what was your old lab like? Ah ha ha ha! Galaxy Defense Industries. State-of-art genetic accelerator. Endless uburnium energy supply. Everything little boy Jumba ever dreamed of having in evil genius laboratory! [laughs] Hah... Um, but popcorn power is good too. [beeps] [Pleakley] Welcome, students, to Earthiana 101. Quiet, class. Quiet! Plooka, spit out that gum! Lenlu, stop playing with your antenna. - Pleakley. - Aah! Oh, Lilo! Don't pay any attention to me. I wasn't pretending to be a professor of Earth Studies, just like I dreamed of since before I could walk on three legs. Not at all! I was just, uh, uh... brushing my tongues! BRB. Scrump, have I ever told you the story of the Lonely Rooster? Once there was a rooster named Pancake. He was lonely. So he went to the beach to make friends. He made friends with a shell named Paula and an empty can of soda named Jimmy and a piece of a broken surfboard named Steve. They were good friends and had fun playing together. But then one day a big wave splashed over the whole beach and washed Paula and Jimmy and Steve away. [wave crashes] Pancake was sad that his friends were gone. But Pancake was never lonely again, because he could always remember them. The end. Lilo, are you OK? Scrump and I are getting used to the way things used to be. So, you're letting them go. They'll say they want to stay, but it's just because they don't want me to be sad. They'll be OK without me, right? Oh, Lilo. You're showing so much aloha spirit letting them go. And the aloha you give will always come back to you. It's like a circle. Aloha means hello, but it also means goodbye. It's hard to say goodbye. I know, baby. Goodbye, laundry! Goodbye, dirty dishes! Goodbye, dust bunnies. Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye! Nani says that letting you go shows aloha spirit, and that the aloha you give will always come back to you. Eh, interesting theory but scientifically impossible. I'm estimating 23 percent aloha - is lost in giving process. - [beakers break] You know, aloha is one of those Earth concepts I never did understand. Come, Pleakley. Oof! What is in here, bricks? Concrete, adobe, terra cotta... You name the brick, it's in there. My students are sure to find them fascinating. Jumba, you belong back in your real evil genius laboratory. But if you're ever missing Kauai, you can play this. It's my favorite Elvis record. Pleakley, you belong at Galactic Alliance Community College teaching Earth stuff to aliens. That's why I'm giving you this rock. Here it's just a dumb old paperweight, but out there it'll be a dumb old paperweight from another planet. I'll keep it with me always. And, Stitch, you belong... I'll miss you too. But you belong out in space, catching bad guys with the Big Red Battleship. This is a very special necklace. I kept it hidden in a sock for three years. It's Ku Tiki, the god of strength. Promise to never take it off? - Promise. - You're number 626. - Name: Stitch. - [camera clicks] Aloha. Aloha. [alarm blares] Don't worry, Dr. Hamsterviel, your escape will soon be complete. What do you mean "complete"? You haven't even broken me out of my cell! Then who is this? That's the warden's gerbil, you nearsighted fish stick! [laughter] Hmm. He looks just like you. [P.A.] Security command, release portal 7. Run! Run! And put down that gerbil! I brought you a little surprise. - What is it? - An Earth souvenir. They call it an aloha lei. It symbolizes... Excellent! I'm starving! Wait! Wait! You're not supposed to... [burps] Never mind. - [clears throat] Aloha. - Captain Stitch. The Council has received... You have coconut cake on your uniform. Oh. Sorry. [slurps] The Council has received a security alert. With the aid of the former Captain Gantu, Dr. Jacques von Hamsterviel has escaped from prison. - [gibberish] - This is your first mission as captain of the Galactic Armada. Seek out and capture Dr. Hamsterviel. It will also be the maiden voyage of... - Oh! - ...the BRB-9000. - [man] BRB fueling complete. - [woman] Hatchway secure. [man] Captain has arrived in the bay. Oh! Big Red... [play march] Whoo-hoo! Aah! [cymbal crash] He, uh, went in through the air manifold. - [door beeps] - Captain on the... - [Stitch laughs] - ...ceiling? Big Red, Big Red, Big Red! Huh? [seat motor whirring] [clicks] Hmm. [gibberish] [computer] Hyperdrive activated... Captain, you're certain you want to engage the H-drive in the spaceport? Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha! [boosters firing] Well, he's certainly enthusiastic. Yeeow! [cackles] Anything I can get for you, Professor Pleakley? Why, yes. You could give me a great big pinch to wake me up! I've got a huge corner office, a complete set of the Encyclopedia Earthiana, my very own walk-in closet, the keys to the college carpool van, and... galaxy-wide fame as the greatest Earth expert ever! [gasp] Is that a real Earth rock? Why, yes. Yes, it is. You've actually been to Earth? You must tell me everything. Of course. But you will have to wait for my first lecture, "Perspectives on Earthiana: A One-Eyed View." Lecture? You don't give lectures. I don't? Oh. Well, then, in my first class you can always... And you don't have classes either. You're a supervising professor. That's why you get all this great stuff: the office, the encyclopedias, your own walk-in closet and wardrobe. Oh, right. Could we take a look at that, um, new wardrobe? Ah! Jumba's evil scientist laboratory. Is just as I left it! So many wonderful memories of evil experimentation, ending with disgrace, arrest and imprisonment, but still wonderful memories. So much new evil to be done. Heh-heh-heh! Where to begin? Antiaircraft lollipops? Oh! Permanently stinky bedroom slippers? Or perhaps device to stop evil genius talking to self. Heh-heh-heh-heh! Eh, silly Jumba. It's rounds time, Scrump. I used to do it with Stitch, but you can help me instead. We just check to make sure that all Stitch's cousins are still happy in the one place they belong. # I lai la ua i la # No mala hini ohana # Welcome, cousins Come on by # Aloha, e komo mai # I lai la ua i la # No mala hini ohana # Welcome, cousins Come on by # Aloha, e komo mai # Aloha # We'll find a place where you belong # Ohana # A family to call your own # Where you feel at home Everybody sing # I lai la ua i la # No mala hini ohana # Welcome, cousins Come on by # Aloha, e komo mai, nai nai nai nai # I lai la ua i la # No mala hini ohana # Welcome, cousins Come on by # Aloha, e komo mai # Aloha, e komo mai # Aloha # Ohana [popping] # Aloha # Wow! Wasp Mummies VI is already out. I hope my dad will let me go see it. - Well, I heard... - Aloha, Myrtle. Where are you taking Gigi? I'm taking her to the canine spa. What'd you do with your dog? He's an outer space pilot in a Big Red Battleship - and fighting bad guys. - [Gigi whimpers] Is not! You're a weirdo! - [girls] Yeah! - No, I'm not! I'm done doing all that weird stuff now. Wanna play dolls? No way! Once a weirdo, always a weirdo. That's what my dad used to say. - I didn't know you had a dad. - Quiet, Yuki. In fact, I bet that's why your dog ran away, and I also bet that he's never coming back. - [girls] Yeah! - Just like Myrtle's dad. Quiet, Yuki! Hey! Wait up! Come on, Scrump. [Nani] Lilo! I told you you can't stay out after sunset. - OK. - OK? [groans] You did the right thing. - Letting them go shows... - [muffled] Aloha. I know. [bubbling] Add two tablespoons genetic material and... Hah! Have perfected evil genius boom-boom liquid for saliva of new experiment. [laughs] Pleakley! Come look! Pleak... [echoes] I'm forgetting. No Pleakley, just Jumba. Shh! Who you talking to? Shh! Stop that. [glass breaks] [Elvis] I'd like to sing a song that's probably the saddest song I've ever heard. [# Elvis Presley: I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry] # Hear that lonesome whippoorwill # He sounds too blue to fly # The midnight train # Is whining low # I'm so lonesome I could cry # Did you ever see # A robin weep # When leaves began to die? # That means he's lost # The will to live # I'm so lonesome I could cry # The silence # Of a falling star # Lights up # A purple sky # And as I wonder # Where you are # I'm so lonesome I could cry # I'm so lonesome # I could cry # [applause] Perhaps other side is less depressing. - Jumba! - Dr. Hamsterviel! I see I have found you recollecting misty musical recollections. Why are you no longer on asteroid of inescapable prison? No prison can contain me! I... I mean, I am fully reformed. Out on parole. I heard you were opening up the old shop. So I am thinking... [sniffs] maybe we could work together again. [sighs] Remember the old days? You creating experiments, I funding them with my shady business deals. - No. - Oh, come on! Graduating together from Evil Genius U? - [scoffs] - Our first business together? [scoffs] What about creating our first experiment? You remember Shrink? 25 years of partnership, and you did nothing but cheat Jumba, embarrass Jumba, steal from Jumba, and finally fink on Jumba to Galactic Federation. For you, I wouldn't create piece of dry toast! Very well, then. You leave me no choice but to forcibly force you to make a new experiment by force! By force! By force! That was your cue! Sorry. Now, Jumba, I will explain this only once and oh, so patiently. I want to order a new version of 626. Make him with extra destructive capabilities but easy on the fluffy. And I don't like blue. So make him resplendent red to match my cape, and make him to go! Jumba makes genius experiments, not fast food. Would take years just to create design. Well, what about this one? [clock ticking] [mutters] Is it done? Is it finished? Can't be rushing evil genius. [telephone rings] Answer it. But none of your not-so-funny funny business. Galaxy Defense Industries, where DNA stands for "Do Not Ask." - Jumba! - Pleakley! - Eh, is bad time. - I'm sorry. It's just that, well... I just miss you so much! I mean, heh, I just happen to be in your quadrant, so I thought, maybe I'll drop by. - Enough! Hang up! - No. No? But don't you miss your Aunt Pleakley? - No! - I'm wearing the wig. No! Not coming by. Never coming by! Never wanting seeing you again. Yeah? Well, me neither! What I meant when I said "I miss you so much and can I visit?" was "I don't miss you at all and I never ever want to see you ever again ever either!" [cries] Is truly evil! Making Jumba pretend to be mean to Pleakley. Just finish my experiment. Hmmph. Am putting finishing touches... now. [# Elvis Presley: Aloha Oe] Why are you playing that annoyingly folksy folk music? Eh, to annoy experiment. Is making him more evil, yes? Heh-heh. Oh, good idea. More evil is good. [song ends] - [evil cackle] - [gasps] [snarls] Oh! He's so beautiful in his ugly nastiness. Oh, perhaps I will mimic the little Earth girl and name you with your very own name. I shall call you... Spike! Heh-heh. She already used that one. Very well. Kicks. - Used it. - Slugger. - Done. - Cannonball? He jumps in the water, makes awesome waves. - [groans] - Why not just call it 627? - You already made 627. - I did? Shut up! I am naming the naming here. I'll think of it. I've got it! I shall name you... - Leroy! - [laughter] What? It is a genius name. My Leroy will be defeated by no thing or no one, - not even... - [explosion] - [all] 626? - Aloha, Gerbil Boy. [laughs] This is all so perfect. A test for my new creation. - Hey! Is my creation. - Whatever. Leroy, destroy him! [Leroy and Stitch growl] [growling] [snarls] [growls] - Ah-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha! - What is so ha-ha funny? - I don't have insurance. - Get him, Leroy. Get him! [growls] [crash] Aah! Ooh! [muffled growls] - Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha! - [growls] [cackling] [cackling] - [doorbell rings] - Is this a bad time? [muffled growls] [Pleakley] I just wanted to make up. Next time send flowers. Now that I have proven Leroy to be an invincible fighting machine... Leroy? [laughs] ...I shall proceed with the next phase of my oh-so-clever plan, creating an army of Leroy clones! [machine hums] [cackles] [bell counter ticking] And now, to dispose of you three meddling meddlers. [grunting] I have cleverly programmed this vehicle with destination coordinates 12-21-9-7-9. The black hole! We can't fly into a black hole! I've gotta have the van back to the college by 6:00. Well, you're going to be late by about... ...forever! [echoes] [dinging] - Captain on this... floor. - [growls] [snarls] [speaks gibberish] Captain setting destination coordinates. Zero parsec? Captain Stitch, our orders are to return the prisoner to Asteroid K-37. Why are we setting a course for Turo? [snarls, speaks gibberish] [gasps] You're not the captain! He is now! [cackles] [snarls] [line ringing] [man] Hello, this is Cobra Bubbles. Cobra, I want to call Stitch. I'm unable to come to the phone right now. My current location: classified. Estimated return time: classified. Have a nice day. [sighs] [Nani] Does Scrump want some breakfast? It's her favorite, cold pizza. She's not hungry. She's worried about Stitch. Aww, Stitch can take care of himself. He's indestructible, remember? I told Scrump that, but she gets feelings sometimes. She thinks something's wrong. so I've been trying to get in touch with Stitch. Oh, 'cause you're gonna need one of those intergalactic communicator thingies if you want to contact him. I know! But Jumba and Pleakley's ship is gone, and Pleakley took his space cell phone. Who else? Out of my way! - I need peanut butter! - For breakfast? Hello? Hmmph, Gantu schmantu. Who needs him? Nothing but a pain in the patookie anyhow. Didn't even like my egg salad. "More mayonnaise, less dill weed." - Uh, hello? - Sorry, we're not open. - Open? - I'm turning this dump into the best spaceship-shaped sandwich shop on the island. - Where's Gantu? - He left. But I'm naming a sandwich after him, the open-faced double decker blubber butt. I won't ask what's in it. I brought you something. Peanut butter and jelly? [sniffs] Gee, nobody's ever made me a sandwich. Heh-heh. Hey, what do you want? I need to call Stitch. Sorry. Videophone's busted, like everything else in this dump. - Can you fix it? - Why should I? Gantu's the only one who'd call, and I ain't answerin'. From now on, I'm lookin' out for old number 625. 625. I never gave you a name, did I? A name? For me? Let's see. How about Patty? Short for patty melt. Or... Monte? Like a Monte Cristo? Or Pita Pita Sandwich Eata. [chuckles] [sarcastic chuckle] I don't think so. I know! Reuben. Huh. The classic corned beef and sauerkraut on rye. Reuben. Ooh, I like that. So, uh, does this give me official "cousin" status? You know, full ohana rights? All that aloha stuff? Depends. You have to give aloha to get some back. So, you're gonna help me fix the videophone? Sure. Why not? It's Lilo, right? [banging on metal] - [clattering] - [saw buzzing] [air wrench whirring] Uh, you sure that's gonna work? You'd be amazed. Pickle juice is a great conductor. [humming] - You may thank me later. - I'll thank you now. Mahalo, Reuben. Heh. No problem, Lilo. [snarls] - [Leroy laughs] - [beeping] Incoming call from... E-arth, sir. [growls, speaks gibberish] It must be the little Earth girl. Ha-ha! My Leroy will easily dupe her tiny little brain. Hide! Oooh! Aloha, Stitch. - Stitch? - Uh... - Say "eeh." - Eeh. - Are you OK? - No, cuter. Think "plush toy"! Oh, yeah, it's me. I'm Fluffy. That's him, all right. Wait a minute. My tiki necklace. He's not wearing it. That's not Stitch! - Hang up. Hang up! - OK! Bye-bye! - Wait! - [explosion] Ah. I think that went very well, don't you? - Actually, I think... - I didn't ask what you think! - Actually, you did. I... - It was a rhetorical question! Don't you know what a rhetorical question is? - Yes, sir! I believe it's... - That was rhetorical too! [groans] Aah! [sighs] My genius plan is unfolding perfectly. Prepare for hyperspace to planet Turo, where I and my army of Leroys... - [slurping] - Quit picking your nose. ...shall take over the stinky Galactic Alliance! Sir, I must point out a weak spot in your plan. The little Earth girl has a special talent for turning evil experiments from bad to good. And she controls a force of over 600 of Jumba's genetic creations. This makes her a credible threat to your Leroy army. Very well. Then the little girl's experiments must be captured and taken to a large public arena, where I shall destroy them all! [cackling] This is clearly a job for my most trusted henchman. Thank you, sir. I won't fail you this time. You have already failed me 625 times. No, this time I will send my new trusted henchman, - Leroy! - [growls] [static] Reuben, there's a fake Stitch driving the Big Red Battleship. Do you know what that means? I don't know. It's lunchtime? No. Stitch is in trouble, and so is the Galactic Armada and planet Turo and maybe the whole galaxy! It ain't our problem. Look, you're number 625. The closest one to Stitch. If you wanted to, you could have all of his powers. You just have to stop making sandwiches and start making something of yourself. - [sighs] - I'm gonna fix this ship, fly to planet Turo and warn the Grand Councilwoman. Are you with me? I said, are you with me? I'm with you, sister, but first we gotta put this servo unit back in the main drive shaft. You are as strong as Stitch. Now, we reroute the ignition conduit... And you can walk on the ceiling. [Reuben] Whoa-ohh! I'm a little out of practice. Flazookian cartridge clamp. - Here? - Smaishy scoop. - Is this it? - Pickle. - It's got a bite out of it. - Perfect! [rapid beeping] [crackling] [gulps] - [sizzling] - [beeping] And please, keep Weirdlo and her weirdness as far away from me as possible. [crackles] [rumbling] [cackling] [screams] [screams] Black hole dead ahead! [grunts] Aah! Ha-ha! [grunts] [speaks gibberish] [computer] New destination coordinates denied. [growls, speaks gibberish] [metal creaking] lmpact with black hole: one minute. [Pleakley] What's gonna happen to us? According to calculations, black hole will transport us to volcano planet, where we will be quickly yet painfully vaporized! - Vapor? - Unless.... - "Unless"? - Unless we alter destination by disrupting event horizon just before entry. Is requiring small projectile approximately 3-inch diameter weighing 17.2 ounces. But we don't have... Wait a minute! Lilo's rock! - [beep] - Ay! Is 22.3 ounces. Gimme. Impact with black hole: 30 seconds. Go, little monster! Go, go, go! Save us, save us, from the black hole! Yay! [all] Aaah! [cackles] [croaks] [rapid footsteps] [growls] [sniffing] [grunting] [speaks gibberish] [gasps, speaks gibberish] - [chuckles] - [Nani] Lilo, I'm home. - [gibberish] - You in bed already? [snoring] Guess that answers that. [cackles] [# Theme to Hawaii Five-O] It crash-landed in my backyard. I bet it came to take you-know-who back to planet Weirdlo. Yeah. Lilo wasn't in class today. - Maybe it ate her. - Maybe it's gonna eat us all. Well, I'm not gonna wait around to get digested. I'm telling Officer Kaihiko. Come on, Gigi. [snarls] - Nice doggie. - [barks] - [screams] - Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha! [computer] Arrival clearance code approved. They're letting us land. Miss Grand Councilwoman! Stitch is in trouble! He's not in control of... - Hello. - Hamsterviel? - "Hamsterveal"? - It is pronounced Hamsterviel. Dr. Jacques von Hamsterviel, king, top ruler of the galaxy. [cackles] I'd get down and gloat in your faces, but I can't get out this chair. Gantu! Heh-heh! Nice cape. - We're too late. - Indeed. I have taken over the Galactic Alliance using my army of clones named Leroy. - Leroy? - What's wrong with Leroy? Nothing. I like it. - See? - [growls] You can't run the galaxy. That's the Grand Councilwoman's job. She has been demoted. - Dr. Hamsterviel's office. - [creature jabbering] I'm sorry. He's in a meeting. It'll never work. Stitch will stop you. Hmm, Stitch? Sti... Oh, you mean that weakling 626? The one I sent tumbling to his doom in a black hole? Is that the Stitch to which you are referring to? - Black hole? - Oh, don't worry. He's got plenty of company. That idiot scientist and one-eyed noodley thing. Jumba and Pleakley? - What is it? - Incoming call, sir, - from a Mr. Leroy. - Put him through! What is the progress? [speaks gibberish] - Talk normal! - All experiments captured. Excellent! I'm on my way. It has taken Leroy a paltry few hours to succeed while you took three years to fail. - What is wrong with you? - Well, I have a bad knee. No! That was a rhetorical question. You don't answer it! Now will you get me down from this chair. Uh, was that a rhetorical question? No! That one was not... Get me down! Get me down! [Gantu] What should I do with the girl and 625? - Take them to the prison block. - Yes, sir. Then pick up your final paycheck and return your ID. - What?! - You heard me. You are fired. Now that I have Leroy, you are no longer needed. But what about my future? How am I supposed to pay the bills? Well, why not write your memoirs? Diary of an Incompetent Fish-headed Minion: The Idiot Years. [sighs] To assure my galactic dominance, I am now off to Earth to eliminate those pesky experiments! Ah! My years of devotion and hard work, and this is how I'm rewarded? You are right. That gerbil treats you like a pile of blitznak. See, his problem is he's got no aloha spirit. But that will come back and bite him in the tail someday. 'Cause you know, the aloha spirit you give always comes back to you. At least that's what Lilo says. Though it looks like her spirit's kind of broken. Nani says aloha means "hello" and "goodbye," but for us, it mostly seems to mean goodbye. You know, turns out I'm pretty strong. I could maybe open this. Whoa! Ha-ha! I am strong! You didn't open the cell. I did. I'm breaking you two out of here. - Aloha. - Aloha! Whoa-ohh! [speaks gibberish] [speaks gibberish] 625, when did you learn to climb ceilings? The name is Reuben. Once we're through this airlock, it's clear sailing to the spaceport. - [gibberish] - Uh-oh. Hey, this looks like Pleakley's rock, with a bite out of it. Stitch! - Ah! - How did you get here? - No time explaining. - Hurry! Get in! - Whaah! Gantu? - No time explaining. We've got to get back to Earth and save the cousins. Well, how will we all fit? I could ride in the backety-back. [cackles] I wonder what they got in store for us. I heard Hamsterviel is taking over the galaxy and he brought us all here to get rid of us. It's OK. We're just having a nightmare. You know, I had a nightmare once. I had to take a test on spaghetti. I studied rigatoni. I was late for class. I was naked, fell off a cliff, I tried to scream and I couldn't... [speaks gibberish] [growls, barks] [cackling] Finally! It is an evil dream come true. All you ridiculous 625... Actually, 624, 'cause you subtract Stitch and... Whatever! Lock cannon on target! [machine whirrs] Not happening. Not happening. Aloha... as in goodbye. [Stitch] Cowabunga! Aaaah! [laughs] Heh-heh! Who knew carpool vans had such sophisticated weapon systems? My cannon! And you! How did you escape my imprisoning? Gantu turned from bad to good. Hey, where is Gantu? Oh. Heh. He's still in backety-back. [alarm chirps] - Thanks. - What?! He's on the aloha team now. You never did understand the meaning of aloha, did you? Well, I think it means... Uh, that was a rhetorical question. [groans] You aren't the only one with a team, you know. What you forget is that I have my own army, and I have them riding in the frontedy-front. [growling] This is bad. I'm calculating our odds of victory at, eh... zero. [speaking gibberish] [growling] [rumbles] Whoaaah! [whistle blows] - [screams] - [growls] - [grunts] - [rayguns cock] [gasps, speaks gibberish] - [Leroys laugh] - [grunts] [gibberish] - Whoa! - [crash] Yeow! [mutters] [giggling] [electricity crackles] - Nice one, cousin. - You can talk? - [laughs] - Look out! - Boyd! - There's too many of 'em! [growls] - [speaks gibberish] - [speaks gibberish] [growls] - [laughs] - Huh? Uh-oh. Aah! Uhh! Ow, my head. Jumba, a little evil genius help here. [scoffs] If Jumba was real evil genius, he would have programmed shutoff switch into original Leroy. Wait! Jumba is evil genius! Hawaiian folksy folk music is tied into synapse matrix. If Leroy is hearing Aloha Oe, he is shutting down like a car wash in a rainstorm. - Will it shut 'em all down? - Heh-heh. I don't know. Ahh! Eeh! Are you thinking what I'm thinking? Rock 'n' roll, baby! [humming] Jumba, sound! Cranking up to evil 11. Pleakley, lights. Bright. Very bright! Gantu! Uh... ...fireworks? Gladly. - [microphone feedback] - [clears throat] Aloha, cousins! [playing rock guitar] - [string snaps] - [gibberish] [# Aloha Oe] # Aloha oe, aloha oe # E ke onaona noho i ka liko # One fond embrace, a ho 'i a 'e au # Until we meet again [laughs] - # Aloha oe - # Aloha oe [all] # E ke onaona noho i ka lipo # One fond embrace, a ho 'i a 'e au # Until we meet again [saxophone solo] It's working! Aloha totally rocks! [blubbering] Not my original Leroy! [growling] [all] # Aloha oe, aloha oe I am not beach ball light. I am hamster light! [all] # One fond embrace, a ho 'i a 'e au # Until we meet again - [gibberish] - # Until we meet again Sing it, cousin! # Until we meet again # Aloha! - [song ends] - [cheering] [applause] It is with great joy that I return to the Galactic Council, and with even greater joy that we once again honor our greatest heroes. [applause] How can we ever repay you? Especially Lilo and Captain Stitch. No captain, just Stitch. Am I to understand that you wish to resign your commission? Yes, please. Stitch has found one place he truly belongs. On Earth, with Lilo. That being the case, Mr. Gantu, would you be interested in resuming your position as captain of the Galactic Armada? Would I?! Ahem. I mean, yes, Your Eminence. - On one condition. - Condition? I'd like to request experiment 625... ahem, I mean, Reuben, as my galley officer. No kiddin'? I've grown rather fond of your egg salad. Granted. And finally, Jumba and Pleakley. Jumba would like to return to Earth as well. You would? But what about your lab? Jumba is finally understanding ohana is more important. Don't have to be evil genius to see that. Well, then, I surely don't need a non-teaching teaching job. - Your point being? - Crazy head! I wanna go home! That's all I want too. To go home with my ohana. - Eeh. - [applause] [Lilo] Bigger smile, Stitch. Little closer to Nani, David. - Myrtle? - I still think you're weird. But Gigi says she likes being part of an ohana. OK, everybody, this is it. For the last picture in my book, a group shot. The whole ohana! Everybody, say aloha!
