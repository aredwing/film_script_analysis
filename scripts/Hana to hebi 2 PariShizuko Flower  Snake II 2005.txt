FLOWER AND SNAKE 2 Sorry if this looks too much like your wife. This is quite a surprise. Posing like that... You're probably thinking... why I'm messing with this stuff... but for me, is just tinkering on the computer. That's not what I think... but they are very real. I wanted to bind her real... but this way's OK too. What about this? A dead ringer? Uh, well... I've never seen such realism. It's wasted on you. Don't be coy... don't you give it to her every night? Well... At my age, it's difficult... There's drugs to help with that. Try them out. I don't think... Shizuko may seem like a goer, but... she's the quiet type. She has no idea about S&M. I think it's you who has no idea. I know what people hide inside. Shizuko is great... a real femme fatale. I'd ask her to model once. Please do. Brains and beauty. That's a dangerous mix. Not that I know. Does Shizuko... really have a face like that? Does she have a... Are you blind? I snapped pictures of her. Take a few poses, and you could... make a few risque pictures. You probably... wouldn't want to though. Will you publish these? The critics would have a field day. They'd get on a good price on the Paris black market. Porn exclusively by Kiyoteru Oikawa. Like famous masters fenced by the mafia? Not like stolen works... they'd be sought after as erotic masterpieces. By period like you? A member's club... Rich Arabs wait years for membership... I couldn't... I know of these... You need a password to get in, right? When I'm dead my work will sell. Deal with the devil... And your works will last forever. I'd come back as a ghost... to see what my real worth was. You have many years left in you yet. There's much I haven't done in my life. I won't rest if I don't do them. You mean... Shizuko? You're at that age too. Critic and art gallery owner... lucky enough to have a woman half your age... but aren't there some things still to do? What? You know, for someone who studied erotic art... you are far too serious. Don't forget that even people... like yourself... should let their hair down. This life... is the only one you have. Let my hair down? It's over. His wife said to thank you. It's good we did it. He used to say no one liked him... but he was loved by many. Yes. His wife left this. It's from his personal things. Oh. One man's trash... could be... something of great beauty. One man's trash... could be... something of great beauty. That's it, Toyama. I know of these... You need a password to get in, right? When I'm dead my work will sell. I don't know anything about S&M. I've run a bath. What was it he left you? A bibliography. You look tired. Shall I do it? "Tales of the Weird and Wonderful?" It's a rare work from the 1950s. It was penned anonymously. What is... These depict medieval punishments. Durer etchings? The Japan edition. See the crucifixion? Crucifixion? "WOMAN CRUCIFIED ON THE SCAFFOLD" Is this 19th century? Will you read the text for me? Okay. The murder of a master... meant your wife or mistress would be... executed in public. These were nearly all... long, drawn out, skewerings... of the prisoner. It should have been... that the woman was bound... and crucified... but it was usual... for the woman to be... strung up... splayed... and for her exposed vagina... to be skewered. The crowds watching the scaffold could see... everything... of the woman's anatomy. Spectators... would watch while... servicing... themselves over and over. High-ranking women received... harshest punishment. Good-lookers were... subject to... attacks from... their executioners... while being skewered. The cross, hewn of... rough wood... lies sideways in the... pouring rain. The woman, bound... by the hands, is strung to the pillar... horizontal... frame. Her captors groan with excitement... as they take off the woman's armor... tearing... at her clothes. The woman is put in a cotton... loin cloth... and then... the men stand forward. Her captors... splay the woman's legs out... tie her to the cross... ripping away the loin cloth... they leer crudely at her. About the thing I was left... From... Dr. Oikawa? How about a massage? Lie down. There's an artist who looked like he would be a success. I've heard about him. Is this name Ikegami? You remember. Ryosuke Ikegami. When at art school... he fell out with Oikawa, and escaped... to Paris. You can't just call... someone names in the art world. Okay? It hurts. But its good. Oikawa thought about it. Worrying about a talent lost. He wanted your help. Didn't Oikawa send him money? Ikegami's no good. He just took the money and drank... with nothing to show for it. I sent the money. Really? If it was sent in his name... Ikegami wouldn't take it. I see. Go on. Before I die I would... like my efforts to make someone famous. Stop it. I don't know what... I would do if you died. Well? Will you go to him... Take a look at him... decide whether he's would it or... to forget it? I want you to go... and make this decision. Me? Go to Paris? Shizuko... You've done it alone before? Travel? Masturbation. Never. Try it now. Please. What's up with you? Maybe I should try Viagara. Via...? No! Your heart medication... Oikawa gave me some to try with my... young wife. No?! He died of heart failure, remember? Oikawa said if he met a pretty girl... he would take it. It's OK. No need for that. Has someone... said something? It must be tough for you... to have an old duffer like me. You're wrong. It's enough for me to have... you here. I love you. I do. I love you. Bonjour. It's this! Stop! Stop! How many do you want? Stop it! Hey! I'm going to be rich! This is what I do! Then paint! I can't! Ryo... I can't paint this! Is it only for the money I do this? What am I doing? Don't... I... paint my own pictures! Stop it! Stop it! I never promised! Who the hell? Ryo... Stop it. I don't know what... Who are you? I am Toyama's wife. You're Ikegami? My husband contacted you. Toyama? I see. Come in. I'm leaving! I won't help you again. Something to drink? Wine? No... No? I thought you were coming tomorrow. No, it was today. No again? Can I take a look? Go ahead. Take a look. Go on. Which ones? That's all. What do you want? To collect on your years of investment? That's all there is. I've no money. Dr. Oikawa... Dead? Old duffer. And which old duffer sent you money? Doctor... Oikawa... was concerned for you... for ten years, my husband... He knew what he was doing. Asshole! Do you know why for... ten years I haven't painted? I haven't you know, for ten years. Whatever I paint, I just... see myself smiling back. It's hopeless... You're a critic's wife, you understand... being afraid to print. Why don't you try? You're right. Find something inside you. I will. You'll be my inspiration. I'll do you! Strip! Strip! Take 'em off - I'll do you! I'll tell... Don't you dare... Shut up! Don't! I won't be told what to do by an art critic! Then don't take his money! That's great. Stop! Great. Get 'em off! All your works... are half finished! Do you expect to make money? Do you think you're Modigliani? Lying here drunk the whole time... You'll not make money... unless you paint! Modigliani lived for painting! He left a legacy! Great! Great! Let me go! I'll scream. Finish a picture by tomorrow. Then I'll decide. It's make or break time! I need money! Gimme a digital camera and printer. You're not a photographer. I'll paint. With these hands... of mine. To catch a moment with a camera... see it... and put it on canvas. I don't want to just paint... I want to... find something eternal. God? You have high hopes. Maybe. Okay. I'll ask my husband. I'll paint. With these hands. I don't want to just paint... I want to... find something eternal. He's not lazy... he just can't paint... he need inspiration. Just a moment... Sorry. So I'll buy the camera... wait until... he finishes it... before coming home a little late. OK? Just like you. That's fine by me. Okay. Are you eating properly? Don't worry... I'm eating fine. That's good. It's easy to use, see? My number - call me when you're done. Two days only. Just a moment. Stand there. By the window. Quickly. What are you doing? You want the painting don't you? Do it on the computer. I'll paint you. Open up... What the...? Undress. Now. Stop this! Shizuko! I think... you could be my muse! Paint you. No way! Come on. Quickly! Stop! Very good! Stop it! I can't do this! Stop! Brilliant! What are you doing? Stop it! Stop it now! This is... actually your husband's request. My husband? Yes. Two years ago I got a call... he said I could make a come back... by challenging porno and S&M taboos. I couldn't... do it... but now... you're here. Come here to model in my studio. Looking at you... I know I can paint. Your husband's... suggestion. I'll paint you. Undress. Quickly. No good? Fine. I'm sorry. Go home. Wait... Okay... Just... put your hands behind your back. Hey! I can do this. Let me paint you. Stop it! So it's really no good? Do you really... want to paint me? Would being bound... help? I've not felt like this... in a long time. Loin cloth... Lie sideways... Okay. Over here... Up a bit. Up! Down. Pretty. Even prettier. There! It's good, isn't it? See? What will you do now? Look at me, look at me! Feel good? I can see everything. Everything on show. Everything. Everything. Closer... Closer... Everything. Everything. Open up! Now your tongue... More... more! More... more! Come on! Now for the red version. I'll tie it. Up! Lie down. Suits you. Come on. Spread 'em. Wider! Over here. I can see everything. Incredible. Embarrassed? You should be. You know... this takes two people. Done by two people. Stop! Two men... Please stop! No! Why stop? It's going in. One... and another... and another. That's two more. Talk to me! Talk! I can't hear you! Talk! Let me hear you. More... more. That's it, you're doing well. Good. Here's number three. Talk! Let me hear you. More! More! More! More! More... more! Not yet... don't come... not yet. Wait for the real thing. It's coming off. Yes! Now! Let me hear you! Talk! Yes! Yes! What the...? Shit. Hello? Okay, okay... just like the picture? Shit. Wear this. It's so pretty. It's cold out. No more. Enough. Really? Yes. Will you... dance for me? Dance? Free form, as you like. Here on the roof. Buzzati. Buzzati? Ah, the full moon. The end of world? Can you do it? Yes. How long? A month? I'll talk to my husband. Three days... no... two. Is that all? How confident. Hello? Where are you now? In my room. I was taking a nap. I'm painting but I've had a block. Can I ask you something? Put your phone to vibrate and put it down there. What are you saying? Concentrate on your painting! If I call you... I'll be connected to there. I'll be inspired picturing you like that. What? I'll call you back. Do it now. Give it a rest! Are you OK? You didn't pick up. I'm sorry. I'm still waiting. I was watching movies... And my phone was off. I just wanted to talk. I've been shopping. Clothes. Underwear. Yes. Yes. Yes... it should be ready tomorrow. Yes... Hello. Sorry... did I wake you? Thank you. So, you found that something special? A goddess called Shizuko. But it's still useless... only porn. No... it has a certain... something. How should I tell... my husband? Tell him you're with me. You have talent. My husband saw that. Talent doesn't matter... If you're smart you can sell. Have confidence. Look at my eyes! My eyes! Turn over... ass up... Eyes open! Look at my eyes! Look right at me! Look at me! Look! Eyes in the mirror! Are you ready? Together... Yes! Yes! Did you hear a voice? A Parisienne? Parisienne? Is she pretty? There's no-one, its empty. Coming from below... that'll be the caretaker. Won't you get that? Can I ask you something? Why so formal? I want to sell that picture at auction. What? My husband will buy it. No... on the black market porn will sell well. Black market? Fenced stuff and porn... all of the highest quality. You can get a good price there. I don't know. Why do you want to? Your husband would know. Ask him. Really? But there's a condition. At the first bid... I'll get it. Hello. Yeah, OK, but... I can't. No... I said I can't. Who was that? Er... my sister. You're running a porn shop now? Is this what all the agonizing was for? These aren't your style. You paint me. You do me. Use the rope if you want. Please. I'll go now. I'll be in touch. Has she got you... under her spell? Her spell? No... but I've sold myself. She'll sell my pictures. We can live together. You and her? She's married. She's the wife of my patron. It's part of the service. That's all. She's the wife of my patron. It's part of the service. Yes... It's eerie how exact it is. I've seen it, it truly is fine. Unbelievable... He did that only in one day! He had a good model. Oh, he used... a digital camera... transposed my face. Even so... It's genius. Definitely. Do you think... it's just porn though? Depends on the buyer. Don't know about in Japan. With your say so... everyone will think it's marvelous. Japanese people think like that. You're right. He'll do more. Hello? It's Ikegami's sister. Come in. You're going back to Tokyo? Yes. This evening. What about my brother's painting? Please. He painted it for us... and so we will buy it. On the phone you said... Black market. My brother spoke with the owner of my club... He has a chateau, and says he can... sell the picture. Erotic art. It's tonight. That's OK. Who you decide to sell... the picture to is up to you two. Fair enough. Don't you care about my brother? The auction's just for private buyers. They won't let me in. I'm doing it for my brother, but it's dangerous. Dangerous? Come in. I'll take it. Invitation? Here. Come in. Ladies and Gentlemen. Ten million! Any other bids? Do I not hear more? What is this? Do I not hear more? No more? More? Stop! Sold for 50 million! We have a surprise for all our buyers. Ten new items are available in a special auction! We must withhold the name of privacy... but a recently deceased famous Japanese artist... left these ten unique pictures. CG-rendered without a signature. The first is titled... "Peeled Shrimp Contortions" Ten million! I don't believe it! Bidding starts at 10 million! I have 30. No more bids? Wait! No! That is Ryosuke Ikegami's picture! He's not dead, he's still 35! This is the original. What proof do you have this is fake? It's a copy! This is worth more than 50 million! Ikegami, you say? Never heard of him. He's a genius. The man of tomorrow. So there is no point in bidding? Do you not have an eye to tell the real from the false? If you do, then you should be able to recognize it! I have no eye to discern...? Very well. I imagined trouble like this... I have a letter from the seller. Taking into account claims of forgery... I invited the model here. Her name is Shizuko. With the lady's permission, we will do... a reenactment, examining Ms. Shizuko's genitals... to compare the real thing with the picture... and judge which is the real one. So... Is Ms. Shizuko with us? Shizuko! Where are you? Shizuko! Where are you? It's me. Very well. First we will compare the genitals... with those of the girl... in the catalogue. Please... undress. What? You want to prove your point? Don't touch me! Alright! But if the oil painting is the real one... you must promise... to buy Ikegami's work at the highest price! Agreed. We bid 10 million. But, if your picture is the fake one, you will be... guilty of befouling our 1000 years of tradition here. As compensation, you must agree... to model in the pose of all the pictures... so that our clients can see that you are... the pictured person. What do you say? Fine. Very well, let us begin. Step up. With that... undress for us. Alright! I'll undress. That's no good. Turn your butt out. I will examine the evidence. The painter... was faithful to form... color... internal areas... and hair growth... in minute detail. We must examine all these points! Some light so we can see clearly. Don't move. I don't want to hurt you, but... Stop it! So what's the result? Yours is the fake! So now you must do as you promised. What? Prove it! Look over there... at the mole. Like the picture, you have a... small mole just here. The picture you brought has no such mark. Take a look at your mole. Quiet! Witch! What are you after? You're quite something. Sullying our market. Are you ready? Come here! You'll have... some fun now! Up, get them up! This is a mistake! compare the two. "Peeled Shrimp Contortions" No more bids? No! Open up! Let us look at you! Spread them! Not enough? Here! Up! Wider... Can you move now? Suffering? Do it! Let it out! Now! The second work is now complete! No more bids? A book tells us... that witches used to do it with metal penises. This one is a true masterpiece! But you said that I couldn't tell... a real one from a fake! A lie deserves punishment! So you will model this one for us! Now... The third piece! "Study in Clockwork!" No! Stop! Leave her! Stop doing this to her! Who are you? Are you invited? The blond woman invited me. Shizuko fell into my trap! That picture... is a copy my brother made from the internet. It's a fake. So... you are right. I'm sorry for this, but... don't hurt her again. Please. Please. Quiet! So, we continue with the auction. "Study in Clockwork!" Two-shot version... bidding from 100 million! Move. Move! No! Wait! Help! Move. Let them go! Move. Both of them! Where's Toyama? No! Stop! Now I get it. Where are you? Give me Shizuko! Toyama! Where are you? Shizuko is mine! It's okay. It's okay now. I'm sorry. You made a deal with... the devil? Forgive me. I don't want... anything now. No fame... or fortune. Forgive me. I understand. If you wanted... to get a name for yourself in exchange... for that picture... of me... I don't mind. How much... did you receive? Hey! Can you hear? I don't want anything! Instead... give me Shizuko! You forced me to do these things... and watched everything. Satisfied now? Please... give her to me! That's it. Please. It's from his personal things... Oh. You...? The innocent lambs. I made them do it... this double glass. The picture here... is the one... he actually painted in one night. I won't show it to anyone but just look at it myself. You devil! What kind of sick person are you? Stop it! Move away! You're sick. Do you even love her? I would take care of her. Say something! Stop it! Don't hit him! Don't hit my special person! I wanted to do this... before I die. Don't say that. Shizuko... I wanted to... discover something new. But the price... was too high. It's fin e. Don't speak anymore! Not anymore. Come over. This is your homecoming exhibition. This recreates your Paris apartment? Yes. You painted this art in such a dirty room? It was dirtier then. Who was your model? My sister. Really? Sayoko? This is Sayoko. Hello. Didn't you clash with Dr. Oikawa? No, he was a fine man I respected very much. But all this was due to the late Mr. Toyama. Really? TOYAMA GALLERY
