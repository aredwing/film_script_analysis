Handle so much pain I don't know what's left to gain All the guilt and now the blame I don't want to stop this game I'm starting to enjoy the pain I don't care what you claim I still hear your voice replaying The only thing that remains Is to disconnect Disconnect Disconnect My pain (Excited chatter) MllKE SNOW: Animal (Mark Ronson Remix) - Hey. - Hi. - What is this place? - I'm not too sure yet. - So, it's not your room? - No, it is. It's my room. I just haven't decided. Chelsea Teens, exclamation mark. Is this a joke? Well, how do you mean? - Is it yours? - Yeah. - So what does it mean? - I don't know yet. A room for Chelsea teens prone to exclamation? Well, maybe. And that's you? Yeah, probably. Is it you? It probably is. Me too! I'm Emily. - William. - I'm Jim. So what's the purpose of Chelsea Teens? It's a very big question. William? Er...I think it would be nice to talk and make newfriends. We can define what the room is later. EMlLY: So how do we begin to talk? EVA: Choose someone you hate, share it, and we talk shit from there. - Well, I'm Mo. - Who do you hate, Mo? People who hate television. People who think those who watch it are idiots. I hate those people. - Because television is so important. - Yeah. - Do you watch a lot of television? - Tons. EVA: It's important to have a hobby. MO: It's not a hobby. - Important to keep busy? - It's important we study life, William. Right. - Who do you hate, William? - Oh, God... I don't really hate anything. There must be something that irritates you. Er... Grace Rollins. - I love her Ripley books! - Irritates the shit out of me! - She's a wonderful writer. - She's a fake. She's got children into history. That's a positive thing. Ripley Goes To Pompeii. When I read it, I didn't feel any need to read any other books about Pompeii or volcanoes. That's how good it was! Wow. That's one of the saddest things I've ever heard, Mo. Really? Have you got a few minutes? I'd really like to show you something. WILLIAM: Boys and girls, it's the Black Plague... Grace Rollins stylee. BEETHOVEN: Ninth Symphony (2nd Movement) WILLIAM: So, here we have Ripley, our spoilt, smug hero. Glorious, isn't it? Ah-ha. It's lute-playing Archibold! Those wretched rats. Agh! Argh! Somehow, he magically saves the day. Typical Grace Rollins. Don't you just hate her? MO: Great work. I'm in a media club at Chelsea Tech and I've never seen work like that. It's amazing. Besides taking the piss out of Grace Rollins, do you have a wider point? How the lies we're told begin early in childhood. - The suppression of teenagers. - It's a good point. It's got to come back to our parents, right? Do you think our parents are scared of us? Yeah. And they have every right to be. We're better educated than they were. We're more connected to the world. They don't see it that way. They see the opposite. They think of us as an experiment. It's not clear what my parents are trying to produce in me, but, regardless of that, they're messing me up. - But not on purpose. - Oh, no. It's often a conscious decision to mess you up, Jim. I'm cleverer, more adaptable than my parents. But you're still a child to them! - Oh, definitely. - Well... take the power, Emily. - The power? - Yeah, you know how the world works, what makes people tick. - Yeah. - Let's have a bit more ambition. Seize the moment. Make something of the world. Do, make or kill something? Yeah. I mean, how about all three? I mean, to make life count, you've got to use life, right? So how about using these next two months to arrive into the world? Wow. Creative and positive. You really are a teen exclamation mark. (Laughter) Oh...I'm sorry. That turned into a lot of shit. - I think we should meet again. JlM: Definitely. I'd... I'd really like to chat on a regular basis. - Me too. - And me. Eva? Yeah. Yeah, why not. Great. JlM: What about you, William? Yeah, let's be friends. EMlLY: Yes! WOMAN: She's sitting inside. Are you ready? OK, then? ELLIE GOULDING: Starry Eyed Hey. Models 1 have taken on Ushi. - Seriously? - Yeah. They called her this morning. Christ. Who are you with again? Models A La Mode. You should get your portfolio down to Models 1. You're stunning. It's true. She is. - She scowls. - She doesn't always scowl. I've known her since nursery. It's her default expression. - Look at her face. - Piss off. Modelling's more of a hobby for you. - You're too small. - She's so cute. Little Polly Pocket! (Laughter) Ahh! Mo! I'm dying! Help me! I think that's our last session. Do we need to meet and talk again, do you think? You're feeling good about things, right? Yeah, I feel great. PSYCHIATRIST: And Paul? We've all benefitted, for sure. Thanks for everything. I feel like you're part of the family. PSYCHIATRIST: Well, if you want to make up the spare room... So, I wish you all the best. Keep talking. All right, William? Thank you. AMANDA BLANK: Make It Take lt (Giggling) EVA: There comes a time when you see your friends for the posh, vapid bitches they are. Well, it's shocking. Well, I really appreciate your time - in what seems to be a very... - Let's make it short. Sure. Good afternoon, ladies. Welcome to this two-day course in deportment and public speaking. DELIBES: The Flower Duet This is your room? This is it. This is your personality? This is an aspect of my personality. (Claps twice) Follow me. SKY LARKIN: Somersault Let it go... This is a room. Oh, wow. - Hello! - Hey, William! - Great. WILLIAM: Are you all right, Emily? Isn't this the most beautiful place you've ever seen? I love it. It's great. Eva... I can't remember inviting you here. I mean, come on, look! I couldn't stay away! I'm sorry. You don't mind, do you? Do you want me to go? Oh, let him stay, Eva. Come on. Sure. Whatever. Let it go We've been stealing voices from throats Somersault, let it go Let it go No-one's sitting here, are they? What is that? It's a golden gourami. Yeah, I just bought it...now. You bought it dead? Shit. So, are you gonna talk, then? Er... She's an only child. It would have been nice to have another one, but it just didn't happen. EMlLY: It's all so desperate, but they're turning us into these unbelievably dull people. It's dull and tasteless. It's a good combination. I know we could be happy if they respected themselves for what they are. So I want to wake us all up. And I want their love. I really do. Well, the closest our family's ever been was when my dad had prostate cancer. I mean, that malignant growth in his arse was the happiest time of our lives. Do you think you could fake a semi-terminal illness? I've never tried... Or violence, then? Seriously? Yeah, a family under attack will always pull together. Is that true? A little fear and they'll stop with the social climbing, get back to the basics of loving their daughter. - You think so? - It's a wake-up call for them, Emily. You'd just be doing them a favour. Right. So, for the purpose of bringing you closer together, do you think you could do some random violence on your parents? - I could try some random violence! - Oh, fantastic. Of course, I wouldn't know where to start. Oh, well, myself and William can brainstorm ideas with you. Just small, petty things to begin with. Right, William? Premeditated murder I disapprove of. - But random violence I can do. - Good boy. - Oh...this is great. - Let's get started! But who's Jim? (Thumping dance music) Yeah, it's nice. It needs a bit of colour, though, right? Er... You don't talk much. Is it that you're shy, or don't you like people? Shy. Do you allow yourself to have friends? No. Do you think you'll be here when I come back outside, Jim? I really hope so. (Sighs) Ta-da! Shit! (Sighs) (Phone rings) (Train clatters by) Hi, Mum. Yeah, I'm OK. I'm fine. (Sighs) Is there anyone there? Where is everyone? PAUL: And you can do that, you'll have the time? GRACE: I'm doing six months of publicity - they can give me a week or two. - It'd be fun to get away together. - Yeah. It would. Do you remember our holidays in Padstow, William, that house? Erm...no. Too young, maybe. (Phone rings) Hello, there. Where are you? It's Ripley. Where'd you say, Moscow? - Let me put you on speakerphone. - Can you hear me? PAUL: Hey, Ripley. - Hey, Dad. - So nice you called. - What are you doing in Moscow? Meeting potential investors. A little exhausting. But listen, I really want to be there for the book launch. What? You're too busy. I want to be there for you. I miss you all. Where's William? William's here. We had our last session today. We're finished now. - Oh, great! - We're starting over. It's great, William. I wish I was there to celebrate. William? Come back! (Youth speaking aggressively in Brazilian Portuguese) (Aggressive muttering) (Overlapping chatter in Brazilian Portuguese) (Dog barking in distance) Let's do it, Keisha, love. OK, Si. JODIE FOSTER: My Name is Tallulah COACH: Keep it moving, keep it flowing. My name is Tallulah My first rule of thumb... Nice and strong! Good girl. ..or where I'm coming from... Nice tight knees. Go on, tight knees. So if you really need to, you know how to find me... What you said about your parents treating you as an experiment, that was insightful. That was great, Mo. Yeah, yeah, but you know, maybe they should. - I don't actually do anything. - You're clever, aren't you? I can see that you're bright. - I can be, yeah. I can be. - Yeah, of course you can. And you can do whatever you want, anything at all. You're so positive, man. It's like... MAN: Is this for teenage girls? - Well, are you a teenage girl? - Yeah, I'm Tina. Tina the teenage girl? (With man's voice): Yeah, are you a teenage girl? (With girl's voice): Yeah, and at the moment I'm touching myself. Really? - Are you good at it? - I'm usually a lot better... when I'm not hacking into Tony Layton's home computer and putting his name on the sex offenders register. (Normal voice): Paedo! You hacked him that fast? We've got to secure this room so there's only five of us. (Sighs) Do you think at 17 you can be called a paedophile? Depends on the age of the girl, doesn't it? - 11. - Months or years? Years. Are we talking about you? - Maybe. - (Laughs) - Have you tried anything? - No! I'm ashamed of myself. Well...OK. Why not practise on an older woman? Experience a woman with experience, and it might take your mind off the younger ones. - I'll find you some addresses. - Cheers, Will. MO: What screws do you use? I mean, they're good screws. And a good screwdriver. I mean, I love the detail, the yellow and the black. They go right in there. Great, are we nearly decorated? I think all of you teens will be overjoyed. Excellent. Will we exclaim? - You will exclaim. - Oh, thank God for that! - What about the security? - Paedos locked out. Well, most of them. I hope you boys like the new look. - Have you got the password? - Of course I have. - (Bleep) - Dead Ripley. (Buzzer) MINI VIVA: Left My Heart in Tokyo - Whoo! I left my heart in Tokyo Down by the river, don't you know? I had to let it go... - Isn't it fun! I left my heart in Tokyo Down by the river, don't you know? I had to let it go... GRACE: William, you have to be with us. Mm. I can't do this again. Come downstairs. - I have friends. - Online friends? (Clicks mouse) Yeah. You're not going to get better talking to strangers. You want to make sure that boy you were doesn't come back, right? No, I don't wanna be like that again. Then come down and talk. - We just want to see you better... - I just, just... (Mumbles) EVA: So, Jim...you're up! (Giggles) What? Anything to share? Who do you hate? Well, I'm not too sure. - It's difficult. - Come on! Come on, get personal. Who is it? - Who does Jim hate? - (Giggling) Me. Really, Jim? EVA: You hate yourself? So what? Do you have an OK family life? Yeah. Yeah. I don't have a father. But my mum's really nice. EVA: Oh, so you hate yourself because...? (Panting) I've been on anti-depressants for two years. EMlLY: And do they help? Do you know whether they're helping? I don't know. - Maybe. - Come off the medication. If you want to feel like a person again... ..come off them. You do know that, don't you, Jim? Yeah. Yeah. We're your friends. If you're brave enough to come off the pills... we'll be there for you. - Won't we? MO: Definitely. EMlLY: Yeah, absolutely. - You'd do that? - Yeah, we don't want you to be alone. Some people like to stay faceless in here. Do you think... ..we could see what you look like? Jim? (Laughs) It would help. Yeah. Yeah, all right. (Inhales deeply) You don't strike me as a charitable sort of person. What are you going to do? Banish some demons. Give him some answers. We're playing around with Emily. Do you want to mess with Jim a little? Maybe. Just maybe? It's your birthday tomorrow, right? Yeah. Only right that I get you a present, then. Who do you hate? (SIow breathing) (Girl speaking in Japanese) (Traffic noises) (Distant thud and screeching tyres) It's good you're coming. I appreciate it. Well, I want to help, so... (Scraping) THE SWINGLE SISTERS: Prelude No.11 in F - Tell me where you're from. - Tell me what you'd do to me. - Do you like handcuffs? - (Giggles) (Speaks Japanese) She's really lovely, and she's into gymnastics. She's really clever. Erm... But I'm attracted to her, and that's a bit weird. Would you like me to be Keisha? Nah, you're all right, thanks. What are you doing here if you like Keisha so much? Well, a friend gave me the idea. To go online, you know, see what the older lady likes. Get your mind off the kids? Yeah, that's the idea. Yeah. Unless you're a pervert. In which case, you take it any way you can. I'm into rape scenarios. - You're what? - Get up to Leeds. There's a piece ofwasteland behind me. - You could have me there. - Jesus Christ! You sound dead sweet. Always wanted a sweet boy to shag me in the mouth! Where are you going? - (Chuckling) MO: It was a bit weird, and I was, like... I felt like I was being raped. I swear to God, honestly. It just felt a bit wrong. People abuse these dating rooms. Don't worry about it. But it was creepy, mate. It was just like... You know? Well, tell Si how you feel about Keisha. What? Friendship's all about forgiveness and understanding. It's... It's not like you've done anything wrong, Mo. - That's right. - Yeah, the heart can't be controlled. Tell him, he'll understand. - OK, I'll try it. - I have a present to deliver. Can you just take overfor a bit? Do you mind? - See you later. - Later. Laters. - (Bleep) - Dead Ripley. CHEW LIPS: Karen Whoa. (Chuckles) You just can't stay away. It's impossible. Please. I'm controlling her discussions, her correspondence, any information she puts out there. I've image-morphed her face onto the bodies of these girls. (Cackles) It's like she's been in porn for two years. I've broken into Models 1 and I'm working more subtly on her portfolio. I'm altering the length of her nose, narrowing her lips, shortening the distance between her eyes. It's imperceptible but enough. Oh, my God. I know I said I hated her, but you've...really killed her. WILLIAM: I know. Isn't it great? Thank you, William. Happy birthday, Eva. SI: What do you wanna do? MO: Whatever. - Maybe watch a DVD? - Yeah, yeah, yeah. A Kate Winslet one. Oh, I love that bitch. Erm...I need to talk to you about something. Sounds draining. Make it short. You know when you was asking whetherthere was...a girl? You're gay! No. No, erm... - There is a girl. - Who is she? Come on, man, tell me. Who is she? Keisha. Keisha your sister. - You're joking. - I'm not. She's 11. I know. - Have you touched her? - No! - But you were going to touch her? - I needed to talk to you. I'm not her pimp, Mo! There's nothing to talk about. She's an 11-year-old girl. You paedo! Can we talk about this without getting angry, OK? I haven't done anything. The heart can't be controlled, Si. - The heart can't be controlled? - Yeah. What kind of gay shit...? (Muffled shouting) (Shouting in Brazilian Portuguese) Speak, Jim. We're all here for you. I'm seven years old. And erm...my mum's gone away for the weekend. A break or something. My dad's staying behind to look after me. And... we're sat at the kitchen table, just looking at each other. So, he asked me what do I want to do. And straightaway I say I want to put on my cowboy costume and go and see the penguins in the zoo. Can't wait. It's going to be so good. Don't you think? Definitely the number one fan of penguins. So... ..we're going... We're inside the zoo now, and I go straight to the penguins. And I'm standing in my cowboy costume looking at the penguins, and having such a great conversation with my dad, you know? It was...like, a perfect childhood day. He lets go of my hand and says he'll be back. And he goes. Gone. And I'm happy looking at the penguins. But... it's been, like, an hour since he left, so I start to walk around the zoo, looking for him. And I'm not worried yet, I don't talk to anyone or... I just go to the bus stop we got off at earlier and I get on a bus and I tell the bus driver my address. And he asks me where my parents are. And I say they're at home... waiting for me. I get the key from under the mat. And I go inside. And I'm alone there. It being a Saturday night, I have a bath. And I get into my pyjamas. Because my dad would've liked that. Er... It's getting dark outside. And I start to worry. And I get the quilt and I go into the bathroom and I lock the door. And it feels safer with the door locked. He's not coming back. He's never coming back. What your father did to you... leaving you like some dog, is incredible, Jim. I don't know what it is, but erm...I'm feeling better. Erm...maybe just sharing that story with everyone... You're not getting better. - Don't say that. - What do you want me to say? What, that you'll be happy in two weeks' time? No, I just... I need some help, William. I need to stay positive... Stay in the moment, cos you're feeling down and panicked. - Know what you're dealing with, first. - Are we going? Look... you need to talk to people who are going through the same thing as you. I know this room. Called Dorfli Place, I can get you in there. It will help. Jim. Jim, it helped me. Yeah. Yeah, OK. - (Sniffs) - We're still friends, right? - Yeah. - Yeah, I mean... Look, we're gonna have our disagreements. I'm not leaving you, Jim. I'll never do what your father did. (Thud) (Gasps) What are you doing? Aren't you over this? Give it to me. This is sick. Get out. Get out! That's mine. Just give it to me cos it's mine! Just get out! Will you get out! GRACE: William? Please, sweetheart. Don't do anything. PAUL: Open the door! (Thumps) I need to know you're not going to hurt yourself. It's only a video on the internet. I'm over all that now. I love you. You can always come and talk to me, William. You know that, right? Phone. (Grace sobs) I need to take you to this room. The whining that goes on in there! These kids, you want to annihilate the lot of them. Can we talk about something else? Yeah, of course we can. DOVES AND JANE WEAVER: Seven Day Smile Have you been flirting with me? (Posh accent): I had to rescue you from those appalling toffs you call friends. (Chuckles) So... ..are we boyfriend and girlfriend? Well, after I've crucified Jim... ..I think it might be safe to take it to the next stage. An actual physical encounter? Best not to rush these things. Difficult to know who you can trust. Cheeky bugger! Do you want me to call a doctor? No. I'll be fine. You ring me later. OK? I love you. JlM: He wasn't well enough to have a child. They'd have been better off if it was just the two of them. So he hated you for being alive? Maybe. To blame a child for his shit life... I hope he shot himself. Have you ever held a gun, Jim? No. (Gunshot) Frightening things. - It'll be fun! - Watching tennis? Henry's dad's got a box. There's gonna be a whole group of us. Another day with that type of person and I'd chew my hands off! - Right. I'm coming round. - No. Stay where you are. You live next door to me. Don't you hate us? What are you talking about? We are appalling bitches, Charlotte! Shut up! You know why you can't see that? Because your head is stuck up your incredibly tight privileged arse! We are horrible people! (Moaning) (Screaming) We're going... (Overlapping conversations) You're late. What were you doing? Wiping out my past. Good. Don't you think you've let him down? You started it. You come here with a little problem and she'll turn it into a nightmare. BOY: I didn't mean those things. But if you tease someone like that, they've every right to hate you. I know. He's your brother. He's not gonna forgive you so easily. Right now, you don't feel like you deserve forgiveness. Right? Does she think she's helping? Do you still feel like hurting yourself? - She doesn't care. BOY: I'm too tired to think. (Chokes back sobs) They're all going to beat you again. And when you think they've stopped, they're gonna start over. You take control of your destiny. Do you understand? - This is wrong. - By ending your life... - What is? -..you're fighting that shit. You're only taking the piss out of him. Of course I am. (Door buzzer) (Buzzes again) MUM: Jim? Who's going to be fastest? Definitely mine. MUM: Beautiful boys. I know the patterns of what may happen. I advise as best I can. JlM: But why is the room hidden? Some kids arrive at a decision where they feel they can't escape depression. It's a safe room. To commit suicide. Have you had suicidal feelings lately? Yeah. So what keeps you living? We cook him a few days. Let him wallow a little more. And then he'll fall apart. And that's all you're trying to do? Well, of course. TIFFANY PAGE: Better Late Than Never But why? (Heavy sigh) He... He just reminds me of a boy I used to know. This... ..lonely, nothing of a boy, and I really hate that memory. Where are you? Right now? In my bedroom. You're lonely, aren't you? Yeah. And you? A little. Are you a happy person, William? I'm not a happy person, at all. But right now... Right at this moment with you... I've never been happier. Welcome. Welcome, everyone. The Ripley Time Traveller books are beloved by so many people around the world. She really is an extraordinary writer. So, ladies and gentlemen, the woman herself, my mother, Grace Rollins. Thanks, Ripley. This is the eighth and... final book in the series. (Murmuring) I started writing these stories to read to my boys and it just seems right to have it here in our home. I'd like to thank our friends for all your support, in the last year in particular. My family means everything to me. I'm so proud of the two boys. To have them healthy, to have them here with me today, it's a wonderful thing. They're completely embarrassed, but still... To Paul, William and Ripley. Thank you. Well done. How are you? Can I introduce you to someone, Grace? It's fine. Go ahead. Really. I love you. (Beeping) No. Jim, stop! We need to talk. What is that? - What we said... - No. - No, no, no. - Give it to me. Do it! I need to... I need to talk to Mum. OK. Just... I need to go. I've got to stop what I'm doing. OK. Where is she? You stay in your room and out of sight. You've been nothing but a fuck-up! No, no, no. No! Jim. Are you ready for your therapy now? We're all waiting for you. Yes, William. (Crowd boos) WILLIAM: Born in the hope of shaking his fatherfrom his unipolar depression. Born to a mother who dresses him up as the perfect entertainment. The rugby. The fencing. The archery. Daddy, are you happy with me now? Are you happy now, Daddy? Oh, no, what have I done? He decides to stay indoors, praying for a sibling to play with. But a fruitless year of shooting blanks and punctual periods sends his father further into an unstoppable depression. Oh! Oh! Useless! Oh! Oh! But I don't want another child like that miserable boy. He's making me worse. I can't even look at him, I tell you. One terrible day, his father left him in the zoo, leaving his family in the poo. You have pushed me over the edge, boy! I'm out of here! On the day of the first anniversary of his father's disappearance, the boy takes his very first Valium. He's aged eight. I'm eight and a half, actually. The pills go a little way to quietening the voices in his head, but, in his soul, he knows that he's to blame for his daddy's downfall, his daddy's disappearance, his daddy's probable death. Like every other sad, misguided fool on the planet, he tries to find some answers in the World Wide Web. Hey, man! Woo-hoo! Go, USA! Yeah, man, I'm gonna do it! (Gulps) Like others in the suicide club, he reaches a moment of clarity. Oh, maybe I should kill myself. I'm sorry I was born and made you sicker, Daddy. It's all been my fault. And I'm sorry I drove you away, Daddy. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Daddy! I'm sorry! To see it condensed like that is always gonna be difficult. Jim's got to turn his depression into an act with some sort of expression. I can see what you're doing. Only me and Jim have any appreciation for what's going on. You have no idea what I'm doing. This is about Jim purging, about killing his past. That was so cruel. It's a well-documented psychotherapy, Emily. Yeah? It works. - What makes you the expert? - Oh, shut up. What do you know about depression? You've written a book on mental illness? My mother killed herself, Mo. She was just like... Jim... ..and his dad. I've lived with it for the last two years. I know how... devastating it is. (Sobs) I imagine... ..my mum coming into my room... ..and... finding me lying there. Every day she must look at me... ..and think of my dad. I need to do what's right for both of us. I need to finish this. I think it's about time I met him. Put him out of his misery. You're trying to kill him. "'Assist his suicide." It's a different thing entirely. And we're all implicated. That's why we're here. Why you've been friends with me. Oh, you didn't think I actually cared about your little identity crisis, did you? I mean, cos you've got such a difficult life. Trying to figure out a way of stopping this? There are people I could call. Oh? No need to. Not when they're calling on you. EVA'S DAD: Hello, Ushi. What's the matter? Why don't you ask that bitch of a daughter? POLICEMAN: Is Eva in, sir? Eva? Come down now. - (Knock at door) MUM: Jim? Can you open the door? I'm worried. Come on. Are you OK? I'm fine. Just go. (Ringtone) I've got something to give you. You choose where to meet. Dead Ripley. (Girl on TV speaking in Japanese) Stop this please, Jim. This isn't what you want. It can't be! William's been lying to you, to all of us. What he said about his mother, she never killed herself. Look! Look atyour own mother. Right? MO: Yeah, I suppose. Mine's a spoilt cow, I swear. I don't know why he's doing it, but... ..William wants you dead. I can see it. You think I'll take advice from a wannabe-paedophile, Mo? (Sniffs) If you had any conscience, you'd take a gun to your own sick head. I'm here to help you, Jim. You'd better pray that when William is finished with me he'll have the energy and dedication to annihilate a prick like you. It's you, right? You get in my way... ..and I'll make your life hell. I've gotta do something. - Like what? - Find Jim. Tell him what's happening! You're not gonna be able to do that, Mo. Why not? Cos I'm in your system. And I'll wipe it out. (Rumbling) Get out of here! Move! Quick! We need to get to Jim today. Where can we meet? We have to get back to the city. - What's happening to my computer? - It's William! Shit! Where can we meet? I need your help! Charing Cross Station. One o'clock. I need your help, Si. Hey. H-H-Hey. Hey, hey, hey. Erm... Who's he? The computer geek. MO: And how do we get to Jim? SI: Take me to the room. Once we're inside his system, we'll track Jim down. Dead Ripley. You choose where to meet. Where my dad left me. Hold it. Hold it. Two secs. Thank you. Let's go! William tried to do it before.
