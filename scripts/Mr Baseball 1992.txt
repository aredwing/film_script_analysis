By the way, what is his order in batting? The spirit of baseball in Japan is the same as in America. He welcomes all advice from most honorable manager. Okay. Thank you very much. Oh Man! My aching back! It's like jerking off before sex. Ball seems to be flying well. GOOD LUCK. Turn up your radio - It's Elliot. What was that! Front foot in, hand over. Way to go! Way to go! Be quiet! Concentrate. When the game is over a fat lasy will sing to us. Let's go! He is becoming an embarrassment to us. You do not appear to have found the answer to the Giants As usual they stand between us and the pennant. I beg your patience. Our patience is running out. And your CONTRACT is running out. White trash! What the hell are you thinking of! Suspend Elliot indefinitely. And consider yourself out, as soon as a replacement is found. You have brought dishonor to team. Replace the runner Bring the doctor. I'm home Grandfather, grandmother, this is my friend, Mr. Jack Elliot. We know who this is. You go too far Hiroko. Where is father? He is garderning. Is that you Hiroko? WHAT THE HELL? Don't be angry. How could you! You needed to see another side of him This is not for you to decide. Teach him properly Hiroko. Why do you always put people down? You always do! And try to fit everybody into the same mold! Hiroko. Sit down! Try a little understanding! Looks like he's run out of excuses. I'm sorry. Foreigner charming, foreigner romantic. And foreigner always leave. I would like to apologize to you all. From now, on I would like to make an effort, To be a real member of the team. And between us I'd like to build... ...A chopstick ...an edge. ...A bridge? A bridge. Build a bridge of friendship. It's only the 5th inning. Do you know that? Where's your answer!? Jack Elliot is challenging manager Uchiyama's record, Which was set 18 years ago. Dragons are very close to winning the pennant from the Giants. Isn't that fantastic! Why are you still here? I'm Working. But the game is about to start. Aren't you going? No, I'm not. Foreigner charming, foreigner romantic Foreigner returning to America. I'm sorry. It's okay. See you! See you! Due to the importance of this game We have a list of strategies we want followed. To my knowledge you have not yet found my replacement Therefore, I am the manager I will manage the team. Now excuse me, I have a job to do. If Giants win and... If Uchiyama San loses his record Dragons will lose face very badly! I feel good na na na na na na na! Park it! He stepped on the plate! I saw it, he's out! Giants 5. Dragons 1. Middle of the 7th. Rally caps. Let's go. Giants 6. Dragons 5. Two outs. The bases are loaded... What will Uchiyama do? Uchiyama knows who pays his salary. He'll go for the bunt. WE KICKED ASS! We have won the pennant. Thanks to you. You have brought great honor to team. Then you will want me to stay as manager? Please. Thank you. Can I come in? Nice place! I have come on behalf of Jack. He wants you to know... He loves you... And wants to discuss the future with you... When your "jet's are cool." But he's like you, father. He will not change. Changes occurring all around Perhaps you should listen first. He is... A foreign ball player Who you are in love with. It doesn't matter. It does matter... More than anything Doesn't it? This is for you. Very nice of him. It's not from him, it's from me. From now on... I want to speak to you from my heart with no holding back. Father.
