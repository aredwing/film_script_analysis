You've had incredible success... and you've had it in a variety of fields-- music, films, martial arts, pottery. How do you do it? Well, Bob, I'm a pone toni. - Got my dillies on a peppatain. - I hear that. Now, Pootie, a lot of young artists say that you are their inspiration. Well, I can't say the nay-no, my brother. Wa-da-tah. You got a new movie coming out, right? Yeah. Yes, it's called Sine Your Pitty on the Runny Kine. - And who's in it besides yourself? - Oh, well, there's Trucky... Bad Bitty, Dirty Dee... Lacey, J B... Biggie Shorty and Robert Vaughn. - You have a clip to show us? - Yeah, baby. All right, let's take a look then at this clip... from Pootie Tang's new movie, Sine Your Pitty on the Runny Kine. It was the year 2001. It was the best of times. It was the worst of times. The big city was thriving, but the inner city was dying. Who was killing it? This man. Dick Lecter. The head of corporate America. But the people had hope because they knew that there was one man... who could fight the power. One man who could stop the madness. One man who could beat Dick Lecter like the LAPD. And that man-- that man was Pootie Tang. See that guy? That's Bad Bitty. The baddest drug dealer in town. Hey, Bad Bitty, here comes Dirty Dee. Dirty bastard! That's Dirty Dee, the dirtiest dude around. He handles all of corporate America's dirty work. Next to Dirty Dee, that's Froggy, the Enforcer. Yo, Bad Bitty! How you be? I'm bad, Dirty Dee.

And that town was called Chicago. As he grew... everyone noticed something different about the way Pootie would talk. It baffled everyone-- doctors, scientists. Let me break it down to you like this. Pootie Tang is, was and will always be... too cool for words. Pootie Tang was the most popular kidin town. We didn't always know what he was saying... but we always knew what he meant. Like I knew I was his best friend. That's me. Trust me. Yeah, he had a special effect on people... especially on the ladies. Not girls. Grown-ass women. - Hiya, Pootie Tang. - I'm a tine cappy, my damie. - All right, Pootie Tang. - But for some of the ladies... Pootie was just too hot to handle. Damn you, Pootie Tang! I can't take no more of this! Who do you think you are, treatin' me this way? I've had it with you! You hear me talkin' to you with your nappy head! This is it! I'm finished with you! Get out of my life, Pootie Tang! You think I'm jokin'? Take your shit! Take your shit and get out, Pootie Tang! I'm sick of you! Pootie-- Pootie, don't go. Pootie Tang was an only child. His father, Daddy Tang, worked hard to raise Pootie right. He had this belt. He was so fast with that belt... that before Pootie could do wrong, Daddy Tang would set him right. Don't you grab them peas without askin' your mama, boy. May I dane on the cherries, Mama Di? Yes, you may, Pootie Tang. That's better. You got to have respect to get respect, Pootie Tang. So, do you have any girlfriends at school, Pootie? Aw, Mama Di. There's a sine tippi in a classi-ti. She's a cole toni. Don't you talk dirty to your mama, boy. Always got your head in them girls. You need to have your head in the books. Leave the ladies alone. And that's the way it was. Daddy Tang and his belt was always there... teaching Pootie the difference between good and bad. Now, when I say he was always there, I mean he was always there. Hey, Pootie, let's steal some apples. When Pootie was only six, his mother died... Leaving him and his father alone. - Pootie was very sad. - I know, son. But his father was a comfort to him. Don't slurp your soup in here, boy. Two weeks later, another terrible tragedy. His father was fatally injured at the steel mill. What the fu-- Gorilla! Gorilla! It was incredible. Only the third man to be mauled by a gorilla at that steel mill. On his deathbed, Daddy Tang had Pootie make a solemn promise. Pootie... I know I brought you up tough... but that's 'cause I love you. It's tough out there, Pootie. You got drugs, crime, gorillas. Yeah. I ain't gonna be here much longer, so I'm gonna give you this. Pootie, that's my belt. As long as you got right on your side... you could whoop anyone's ass with just that belt. I know you love the ladies... and Lord knows the ladies love you. Don't let the ladies come between you and the belt. Those were Daddy Tang's last words.: "Don't let the ladies come between you and the belt." But there was something else about the ladies... that Daddy Tang forgot to tell little Pootie. Pootie Tang turned out just fine. Daddy Tang would have been proud. Pootie had it all-- hit records, movies... magazine covers, fancy cars... famous friends, beautiful custom-made clothes... and ladies, ladies, ladies. Through it all, I was right there by his side. That's me. Trucky. And that's my man, Pootie Tang. Big-time celebrity, ass-kickin' crime fighter... and role model to the children. Pootie Tang has a message... for the children of America... so you better wapatah to the bammies 'cause: Pootie says cigarettes and fast-food burgers are bad like netatai. Don't drink malt liquor 'cause you don't need to 'cause you're okay. Sa da tay. Also, eat all your vegetables... and don't bang the dillies. That's Frank, Dick Lecter's right-handman. So what do we care? We care because he's making these. People have been making PSAs for years. Hasn't made a difference. Eddie, hit me with those figures. Since the inception of Pootie Tang's PSA campaign... sales of Lecter burgers are down 30%... Lecter cigarettes down 20%... and Lecter whiskey... almost out of business. For the first time, somebody's getting to these kids, and it's killing us. It's killing us. It's killing us. Hello, Mr. Lecter. Frank, I have a job for you. Yes, sir. I tell you, man, Pootie Tang is one bad brother, man. That's J.B. and Lacey. We make up Pootie's crew. Pootie Tang will draw you a picture of how he's gonna kick your ass... then mail it to you ten days in advance. The picture gets there, right? You go, "What the hell is this?" Then Pootie Tang knocks on your door, properly kicks your ass... and you still won't know what happened to you. You got that right. He is a kick-ass artiste. Know what I'm sayin'? He like the Da Vinci of ass-kicking. That sounds kind of good. Pootie Tang, the Da Vinci of ass-kicking. Aw, man, Pootie Tang whoop your ass so bad... that you could write it off on your taxes. That's right. You got right here, ass-whooping number one... ass-whooping number two. This here, you can't write that off. That's just gettin' beat up. I like to also add that Pootie Tang can kick some ass too, boy. Oh, here come Pootie Tang now. Hey! Pootie Tang! All right! - We was just talkin' about you. - All right, Pootie Tang! Pootie Tang, you going to Biggie Shorty's party tomorrow, man? I guess you're wonderin', who is Biggie Shorty? I'm Biggie Shorty. Let me tell you about me and Pootie Tang. Since the very day we met, I knew Pootie was to be my man. I knew all I had to do was wait... and one day all that bullshit would catch up with Pootie... and he would be mine. Hey, man, you going to Biggie Shorty's party tomorrow, man? Ranacan. - We gonna party tomorrow, man. - There's gonna be bitches there. You right. You right. Respect the women. Respect the women. - Look at that car! - Damn that car big! And long like an old snake. Man, that car's so big, it's got its own sky. Yeah, it's big too. - Keep it running. - Yes, sir. Hiya, fellas. - Kinda hot for a hootenanny, huh? - You hear that? A hootenanny? What the hell is a damn hootenanny? I'm looking for Pootie Tang. Pootie Tang? What you want with Pootie Tang? I need to talk to him. All right, look, Pootie. I'm a representative of Lecter Corp. Do you know what that is? Great. Well, Dick Lecter... the CEO, mind you, of Lecter Corp., he likes you. He likes you, Pootie, and he wants to make you a very rich, rich man. I have a contract here for Pootie to endorse. Tasty Heavy Pork Chunk Cereal. It's delicious. It's a wonderful product. Kids love it. And kids love you. We just wanna put that together. That's a canapan to the semachai. I didn't even tell you how much it pays, Pootie. Twenty million dollars to sign with us for just one year. Oh, what do you say, Pootie? I got to say the nay-no, my brother. - Wa-da-tah. - Wa-da-tah? How do you say the nay-no to 20 million? Why? Maybe Pootie don't wanna sign because he knows you're full of it. Yeah. First of all, he knows that cereal's full of sugar. And number two, that's not all that you guys sell. You sell cigarettes, whiskey, Bad Time burgers, switchblades. It also says here that you will no longer have Pootie doing PSA's... telling the kids to eat healthy and to be smart. Well, sure, exclusivity goes without saying. I'm sure your ugly intentions go without saying. Take a walk, money man. See, my damie, Pootie Tang don't wa-da-tah to the shama cow... 'cause that's a cama cama leepa-chaiii, dig? Hey, Tang, to you, they're children. To me, they're dollar signs. Cover your grill. Sa da tay! Aw, man! You funny, man. You are a funny man. You's a wild boy. Pootie smacked the taste out of Frank's mouth. Oh, man, that was funny to us. But there was one man who was not laughing at all. Pootie Tang goes out there and makes everybody love him. He tells them not to buy my products. He steals from me. And what do I do? I say take my money. Here. Take it. Fine. Huh? And he says no. I guess you're wondering, who is this bitch here? That's lreenie, Dick Lecter's main squeeze... and the most dangerous woman on the planet. Now, she don't look it, but she can bring any man down. I know what makes Pootie Tang... tick, tock, tick. That's cool. All right. Cut the drums too. It's all gone now, Pootie. What do you wanna do? Lepa time. What's he got on his mind? We're starting from scratch, I guess. Pootie knows what Pootie do. This is gonna be good. Okay, Pootie, I'll play back the levels the way you set them. No instruments, no vocals, no levels, everything silent. Set it on me. Bleed. Pootie don't need no words. Don't even need no music. We have got a hit, baby. I like it. Everybody seems to like it. But right now I got somethin' I know you all gonna like. We got the world premiere from Pootie Tang... and you know it's gonna be out of this world. That's right. 'Causeyou all loved his last record... "Sine Your Pitty on the Runny Kine." Well, you all gonna love this new one. The new one is called-- So let's listen up to the new record by Pootie Tang called-- From Pootie Tang. Oh, yeah. Damn, this is good! This is good! Man, Pootie done did it again! Pootie too good!

Air is going, "Man, I'm air. I'm on the list. Let me in." And they won't let air in. And you know air gets in everywhere. That's how exclusive a Biggie Shorty party is. You know what else? It's hard to get in too. I hate you! Go, Trucky! Go, Trucky! Go, Trucky! Go, Trucky! Go, Trucky! Go, Trucky! Go, Trucky! Pretty girl. Pretty girl. Where you go, girl? Pootie, you are the sexiest bastard on God's green earth. - Yeah. - I tell you, though. Someday I'm gonna get me a piece of you myself. - Sepatown. - Sepatown, my ass.

It's like a state secret. How to bed Pootie Tang. Get off him already. He don't want none of your mess. I tell you what, Pootie. Someday you gonna meet your match in a woman. Someday you gonna meet the Darth Vader of T. and A. Some woman's gonna kick your ass and love you to death... and then you gonna be lying in the Dumpster... done banged to death by the dark side of love. And on that day, Pootie... I'm gonna be there. And I'm gonna make sweet love to you. Sexy girl! - Damn, man. - Oh, I'm sorry. I thought she was somebody else, man. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, man. I'm sorry. Damn. I didn't get your name, did l? Damn.

Now, I would never do anything to hurt Pootie Tang. But like I said, Ireenie knew how to break a brother down. - I can't tell you that. - You can't? All right. Okay, wait. I'll tell you. I'll tell you. I'll tell you. I'll tell you. It's the belt. It's the belt. It's magical. He can kick anybody's ass with that damn belt. Yeah. Give me your money, you fancy pants bastard... or I'll stick this in you deep. Wa-da-tah, my damie. Hey, I'm not your damie. Now, give me your cash. I know you got it. Hey, I told you to back off! Pootie, the craziest thing just happened to me. I'm in the club, man. I'm-- Pootie, look out. Bang! Bang! Bang! Pootie? Everything under control? Kayed a brother, di. Kayed a brother, di! I'm a shamey day! I'm a shamey day! Oh, it hurts Pootie to kill a man... but he knows he's got to do it. But it hurts him so bad... to right those wrongs. My man Pootie Tang! Come back on the bettie tai! Come back on the bettie tai! Come back on the bettie tai! Hey, all right, my damie. Why didn't Trucky tell Pootie that he told Ireenie all his business? Just runnin' his mouth. I guess when you see a man being brought back from the dead... you forget shit. Or maybe you just a dumb-ass. Stop the movie. Remember when Daddy Tang told little Pootie-- Don't let the ladies come between you and the belt. Well, what Daddy Tang forgot to tell Pootie was about his only weakness.: ho's. Even Pootie Tang's belt was no match for Ireenie. You can't beat a ho' with a belt. They like that shit. I'm sorry. Did my cart hit your cart? I'm so sorry about that. Did I hurt you? Oh, what a drag. Again, I am... very sorry! Pootie, will you do something for me? Will you do something for Ireenie? Sign your pretty name. Sign it. Sign it. Sign it. Sign it. He signed it. He signed it. He signed it. Oh, God. Signed it? Nice job, Ireenie. You're a damn genius, baby. "I, Pootie Tang, do surrender to Lecter Corp... all the rights to my image and likeness." Oh, yes, yes. "I will whole heartedly endorse all Lecter Corp. products... and will do my best to convince the children of the world... that the above mentioned are all clean, safe... and should be bought and used by all of them." No, not the tippi tais, no. No, no. You are part of the corporation, just like us. Thought you could stay out of it, huh? Welcome aboard, Pootie Tang. Are you looking for something, my friend? Are you? I've got it all now. Shocking news today as beloved Pootie Tang has agreed to endorse... several controversial products for Lecter Corp.... the infamous giant corporation. Yo, fellas, somethin' on the TV about Pootie Tang. Even my kids, man, looked up to him. You know what I mean? They don't even look at Dad like they look at him. But now since he crossed, man, my little-- my little man came up to me the other day and was like... "Man, how could he do that bullshit, man? -- that--" I'm lookin' at him like, "Whoa." Pootie Tang has made my children cry. I'll not support him anymore. Lecter Corp. effectively owns the name Pootie Tang... his image and all copyrights that go along with it. Mr. Tang agreed to do commercials endorsing our sneakers... food products and cigarettes, whiskey, mace, switchblades... rat poison. Mr. Lecter, can we have a statement-- You know, Biggie Shorty, I got to say... I always had a high opinion of Pootie Tang. But the way things are going now, not only has he sold out... he's scraping the bottom of the barrel. Pootie Tang was drugged by that crazy-ass Ireenie. - Haven't you been watchin' the film? - And that's what disturbs me. He's out there telling kids not to go to school... to eat fast food, to do drugs. This is not the Pootie Tang I thought I knew and I used to admire. - He would never tell kids that. - You're in denial. He's out there doing dirt to his own reputation. - You don't know Pootie Tang. - I don't know Pootie Tang? Believe me, I know Pootie Tang... and this is not the Pootie Tang I thought I knew. I thought a man of your stature would have better sense... than to fall for no mess like that. Look, this thing has all fallen apart. The man used to be admired by people of all walks of life. And you know what? If the world is gonna fall for this mess about my Pootie Tang... then maybe the world don't deserve Pootie Tang. What do you think Pootie Tang needs at this point in his life? He just needs some of my good lovin'... and he will be all right. - You watch. - I hope you're right. - I know I'm right. - Yeah, we'll see. - Yeah, we'll see. - That's right. - Watch. - I will. Pootie Tang was messed up. - Punk bitch. - Sellout. - Look at him. Damn, Pootie! - Get a job, you bum. Get it together, man. Pootie looked like who did it and ran. Pootie turned to the only woman who could help him. Poor Pootie Tang. That's all right. Mama's got you. That's all right. Biggie Shorty's gonna take care of you. Don't you worry. Gonna have sex with you too, you know. Finally. Are you sure you gotta go, Pootie? Yeah. That's a damn shame. You were the best piece of man I ever had. You know, you could just stay here and live between my bosoms... for the rest of your life. Pootie gotta flittie tai, Biggie Shorty. Man's gotta do, I suppose. As long as you gone they can't make you do no more commercials. Where you going? I tell you what. I got a little farmhouse outside of Greenville. It was my mama's. It ain't much, but nobody's livin' there. You go out there, find yourself. But then you come back to me, okay? That's a fine tine, baby. Give me some of that bony ass one more time before you hit the road. Man, I hates prison. Prison sucks. I reckon it's supposed to. You got somethin' for me? Oh, this some fine dirt. This is some good dirt. You know I'm gonna hook you up. Man, I hate these bastards. They make me shower every day. They never let me get dirty. I need to be dirty. I'm Dirty Dee, damn it! You gonna be dirty again soon. I promise. It's that Pootie Tang. It's that Pootie Tang. He got to be stopped. I'm the one that's got to stop him. Pootie goddamn Tang! You gonna, you gotta You gonna, you gotta Thank you. Pootie was headed to the farm. I wanted to go with him. - I wanna go with you, brother. - Everything was all my fault. Pootie, everything that happened, man, it's all my fault. - I told that bitch all about him. - I told this bitch all about you. - She just used it against him. - And she just used it against you. - I was sorry. - I'm sorry, man. I'm so sorry. - It was killing me. - It was killing me. - Only did it for the ass. - Only did it for her ass. That deri-teri was all the dinie, huh? - I felt like he saved my life. - Pootie, man, I just feel like... you saved my life. - And I messed his all up. - Now I messed yours all up. - I wanted him to forgive me. - Can you ever forgive me, man? You my main damie, man. Ain't no bad tammie between us. - I wondered if he meant it. - You mean it? - I'm a Baino Denny. - I wanted to go with him. Can I go to the farm with you, brother? Wa-da-tah! All right! Me and Pootie going to the farm! I'm lookin' forward to this farm life. Enough of the city for me. Yeah, this is just what we need, Pootie. Live off the fat of the land, work hard. Farming, farming, farming. I can't wait, man. I cannot wait. We're gonna milk that cow. Get all that milk. Two percent, fat free. Skim milk. All that, man. Chocolate milk. I don't need no television, cappuccino... partying all night long. I'm want some blisters on my hands, some sweat on my back. That's what I want. Shit! Oh, man. My pants. Oh, man! My damn pants. All right. Farming, farming, farming. This is not the thing, man. This ain't cool, man. Dirty shoes, dirty pants... dirty shirt, musty, stinky. It's hotter than a camel's hump out here, man. And mosquitos all over my shirt. I can't do it, man. Whose dog is this dog following me around? Whose dog is that? You don't know who dog that is. That could be anybody's dog. It's too hot. You know you're hot. I didn't wanna leave Pootie... but I wasn't trying to hear all that survival shit. Outback, my ass. I need conveniences, man. On the other hand, Pootie was lovin' every minute of it. He was rejuvenated. You hear that? Rejuvenated. He was "juvenated" before, lost it... and got "juvenated" again. Rejuvenated. And when Pootie planted his first cornstalk... he was happy. Too damn happy, if you ask me. It was just corn. But that was just what he needed to take his mind off his troubles. Rown on the crowny town. Mornin'. - Hi, Daddy. - Not now, Stacy, honey. There's a new fella here in town. He's coming in here in a minute. So? So? So maybe you can marry him, that's what so. Aw, Daddy! Oh, come on. Cut that shit out, Stacy. Here he comes. Yeah. Hey there. You got your can filled all right? This here is my daughter. Stacy. Dillie on... my damie. And she's a looker, ain't she? Huh? God, you stink. Thank you. I wanna talk to you about Pootie Tang. You mean Public Enemy Number One in my world. Right? We learned that anything can be addictive. We took our burgers and pumped them so full of MSG... that people can't even taste real food anymore. Today American kids don't eat 'cause they're hungry. They eat 'cause they just gotta have another Lecter burger. You see, I own Pootie's name. He's mine. I don't need him to sell my products anymore... because I've got thousands of them all over the country. I'm just gonna give them the clothes and this training tape. And remember, when making a public appearance... Pootie Tang always struts like this. Next week we're opening a brand-new nationwide chain of burger stands. Pootie's Bad Time Burgers. In fact, the only thing that could mess up our little party... is if the real Pootie showed up. But that ain't good enough. - I want him dead. - Yeah. I'd like to put that bitch in the ground myself, but I ain't magical. I been tryin' to get that Pootie for years. He done jailed or offed all my boys. All I got left is Froggy. Nobody know where Pootie's at. I know where he's at. I got people everywhere, baby. Nobody can hide from corporate America. And as far as how to beat him... maybe this will help. Hello. - Hello. - Uh-oh. Look at this. Remember her? That's Stacy, the sheriff's daughter. He's been trying to get her ass married since she was 12 years old. Hello? Is anybody here? Why-- I'm sorry, l-- Well, I made you a pie... cake. Do you want the pie? I know I'm not pretty or... or sexy. You probably like a-- a sexy girl, right? Baby... I'm gonna sine your pity on the runny Kine. Now, see, that's what makes Pootie Tang a real hero. He can't stand by and see a woman not lovin' herself. He's gonna put the love in her. Now, me, I say just give her a compliment. Hey, I like your shoes. Have you been working out? Girl, what you doin' with your hair? But I tell you what... I'm only gonna buy this hero shit but so many times. Meanwhile... back in the big city, all hell was breaking loose, y'all. I'm talking about drug dealin', drug usin'... booty shakin '... too much damn TV... drinkin', people eating too much, gettin' all fat and sloppy... fightin', kids out of school, ain't nobody readin'... people actin ' a straight damn fool. And corporate America was just lovin' it. Look at 'em. It's a party now. Since he left, it just changed. Everything just went bonkers, man. Everybody lost their mind and whatnot. Pootie Tang, you shouldn't do this. You should come back to the city, where you belong. Back on the farm, the worst happened. Pootie Tang's cornstalk died. And for the third time in his life... Pootie lost the only thing that was important to him. First his family, then his belt, and now his corn died. Farm life was driving Pootie crazy. He must have lost his damn mind. Look at him. Down on his knees, crying over a piece of corn. Not even popcorn. Regular damn corn. Pootie Tang had lost all hope... and it was gonna take a miracle to bring him back. Up here, Pootie. Hey, watch the leaves. - Daddy? - You damn right I'm your daddy. Pootie, what you doin' runnin' away from your problems? Did I teach you like that? Hey, don't you mumble, boy! Pootie, my boy. Mama Di. Pootie, you're a good man. I'm proud of you. You have so much love in you, and you can give it like a gift. Your father was wrong to tell you to guard it like a secret. - What was that? - Shut your mouth! - Woman! - You corn-ass fool! Teach the world right from wrong... but love the world at the same time. That's the key. Where's your belt, boy? You let some girl get your belt. You let the ladies get your belt. I knew that would happen. Now you done lost all your confidence. I'll tell you something, ain't nothing special about that belt. I bought it at Piggly Wiggly for 95 cents. You don't need that belt 'cause you got goodness in your heart. Now you need to go out there and take that and kick some ass. Hey, don't you mumble, boy! Now, go out there, take that goodness... and teach the world right from wrong. Now git! I, uh-- I think maybe you and me got something to talk about, huh? I, uh-- I understand you and Stacy there... got to know each other, huh? Had yourself a little time there? Yeah. That's terrific! Well, partner, when's the wedding, huh? Like I say... I sure would be mighty proud to have you for a son-in-law. What the hell? What you doin' way out here? You know these guys? I come to call you out, maggot-eatin' bitch! You ain't come one, but many tine tanies. Well, I gets by with a little help from my friends. Now, listen here, fellas, we don't want no trouble here. Why don't you just move on through, huh? - What up, Hop along? -Just back off there, young man. - I'm sheriff of this here county. - Damn! Hold up! Hold up! Rewind that. Go back. Go back. Let me see that one more time! I'm sheriff of this here county. Oh! That had to hurt his ass! I know he's embarrassed. Slap him like a bitch! Ooh, he shouldn't have done that. He done messed around and got Pootie Tang mad, baby. Come on, Pootie! Question: Where do you think you-- Wait! Hold up! Hold up, Pootie! Capa-town, my ass! Oh, you not so bad now, are you? Guess you, um, slapped him like a bitch, huh? Yeah. Now... Like I was sayin'-- I was searching for Pootie high and low... then I finally remembered he was at the farm. All this time I had been talking about the farm. How the hell did I forget he was at the damn farm? Anyway, I got there just in the nick of time. Oh, Pootie, you got to come back to the city right now. - What's the dabble, di? - There's a wedding going on here. Man, they are using your face, man. They're making you sell products even when you're not there. I'm talking about cigarettes, man. And look. Malt liquor? Pootie Tang malt liquor? They got all these Pootie-alikes. You know what I'm saying? Hawkin' all this shit. And everybody thinks it's you, man, really. Come back to the city and let everybody know the truth, man. Come on! All right, Pootie Tang! I ain't the marrying type. I don't make my bed. I leave the toilet seat up all the time. I'm a single-- Oh, but she is a lovely lady though. Pootie Tang and I are thrilled to be opening this... the first Pootie Tang Bad Time Burger restaurant. Right, Pootie? Sa da tay. Sa da tay. Got that? Man, that ain't Pootie Tang. That's Doodie Tang. You know, that ain't Pootie Tang neither. I know it ain't Pootie Tang! I just said it ain't Pootie Tang! It's Doodie Tang! Shut up! Sepatown, tipi tais. There you go. Sepatown, tipi tais. - Oh, Christ. - Hey, that's Pootie Tang. Wa-da-tah. Don't pay attention to him. That's nobody. This is Pootie Tang here. Yes. I'm Pootie. Now, clap it up, my hammies. Rinatine, my America. Coola may, my ca-- You think you've solved the problem? Well, guess again. See, I got more Pooties than you, Pootie. You're not only late, but you're outnumbered. And by this time tomorrow, there'll be so many Pooties out there... you won't matter. He ain't alone, Mr. Rich Man. I'm here too. Bitch! Come on. Let's get out of here. You looking at my ass? You bastards ain't going anyplace! Bye-bye, Bad Time! All right! I got 'em, Pootie! Pootie Tang is back! I got to say the nay-no, my brother. What will you do now, Pootie? We're gonna get married. Yeah. And that's the way it went down. Pootie Tanggot his man, and Biggie Shorty got her man. But not before she handled one little piece of business. Ireenie left Dick Lecter. She now works for the city, counseling teen-ho's. Dick Lecter quit corporate America. He is no wan actor appearing in the touring company... of Wesley Snipes' Murder at 1 600 - The Musical. Dirty Dee is still dirty because he is Dirty Dee, damn it! Man, it is hot today! Ooh, it's hot out here, man. It is hot today! You know, it's hot out. Yeah, I just said that. I said it's hot out here, man. Yeah, you know, it's hot too. Yeah, that's why I said it, man! It is hot out here! I know. I'm just saying it's hot too. Lacey is still getting on JB's nerves. And he's getting on his nerves too. And as for me, Trucky-- - Oh, shit! My lasagna! - What? Oh, goddamn it, Trucky! I can't believe you burned that lasagna again! Who I look like? I'm not Chef Boyardee! You've been burning things since the day-- You know, that is the longest damn movie clip I've ever seen. But then again, you're Pootie Tang. Well, sa da tay. Exactly.
