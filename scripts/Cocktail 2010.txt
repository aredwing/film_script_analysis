She came to the new play station. She offers a treat as she got the silver star for quarterly exam. A play station and a bucket chicken. Ask Ravi to call me. Ok. - Did you see my daughter? - No! She is standing there. You are smart. I was afraid. Looks cute, right? Uncle gave me this. Oh God! Christ! You spoilt it. I wanted to give a surprise! The same surprise always! Why don't you change it for sometime? I'm bored by acting as scared! Why did you cry out? It fell down as you gave me a shock! Are you bold enough? You should have taken my photo then! The real face which scares off the workers in this site! Yet my black Forest is shattered. I broke open the bakery and brought here. I remember when I sees it. ...as the title of the article in the magazine! The memory of the cake shattered. It is my heart which is broken and shattered. See you! 2 minutes plan of mine is there. It was quite a big plan. I've toiled much to get this knife and match box in the dark! Hold it. Blow. Not for me. Here. Let us have it more tastier! Come. - Ammu! - What is going on here? It is mom's birth day! She was cutting the cake! Why didn't you call me? Dad thought that you were sleeping! - Didn't you sleep? - No! - Then? - I was making my doll to sleep! Didn't your doll sleep? How can it be when you make noise? We will give her sleeping pills! What is your mom doing? Ouch! She eats up the cake which have fallen down. Don't eat the cake which have fallen down? Mom is a dirty girl! Keep the knife here. Come. We shall go upstairs... ...and sing a birth day song for her! You are below the shadee e'ee meet down by the dreams. Under the rain of your love e'ee get drenched with memories. With our eyes, we attained the language of mind. Time when you opened the blue window e will tell the sweetness of the heart et has filled my heart with love You are below the shade e'ee meet down by the dreams. Under the rain of your lovee e'ee get drenched with memories. Did Abheri tune the wind sings caress you? The light clouds in the dusk applied... ...dot on the foreheade The heart filled with happiness ...the time when the tune has playede Who is the star searching? Is it the eye of the star? Yet we together will climb the steps Above the sky blesses us a virtuous lifee You are below the shadee e'ee meet down by the dreams. Under the rain of your lovee e'ee get drenched with memories. M. D is quite angry! What did I do for that? He is asking the same! What is the solution? The matter is a bit complicated, sir! I am not interested in the size of the problem I am wondering which engineering college gave your degree! - Sir! That is... - That is? You know what you have done? The 18 storey building which was built by us by the plan of sir! The one of the 2 buildings is... ...The Heavenly Heights of the Spectrum Constructions! The other one is Bay like tower of Metropolis The approach road is in the middle! What should be the width? Sir! 12... It should be 12 meters! What happened then? What is the width now? Did you see now? Government has brought a stay now What has to be done with this building? Should it be demolished? The company is the loser if we buy the plot! That's why What now? We are trying hard to avoid the loss We can handle that problem! You have to do the job which is given to you! Almost everyone in the firm... Even Ravi sir is aware of the problem! - Where is Ravi? - He is in the cabin! - He is in a meeting! - Call him! The Approach Road is only 10 meters which should be 12 meters! I told already that a couple of cents are to be added Isn't it? I gave you a written statement duly signed already Get the blue print here Isn't it 3 years old? You told me once that your wife has a cousin in the ministerial staff ...and he could handle this neatly He got a good amount for changing 12 meters to 10 meters Those guys in the corporation too got the bribe Who is taking the decisions of this kind? But I have to talk to you only You too have to be vacated from here There is a way for that It is a little out of the box thought There is money involved In the long run our company will have the benefit If come through Vallarpadam Terminal... ...Kochi will be better than Visakapattanam Port Even it could be better than Mumbai Port! At the back side of our project... Here! This is a land of 25cents It is with a Siva Subramaniyam! We have to buy that plot There was no access to his plot... ...as our structure was built up There would be only a little space for a scooter to go We can buy it cheap now On the opposite side of Siva Subramaniam's plot... ...on this side of the lagoon it is the Vypin Cherai route If we construct a bridge with our money for us to get there... ...the government will be lenient to us! Don't you know how to tackle that? The bridge is the bonus we offer the government If the bridge is built it'll be a short cut... ...to Thrissoor without touching the high way We could save one third of the distance! Government will be with us I'll ask dad to talk to the minister! This talk of ours should be secretive between us Secrets are leaked out from inside I'm not sure if it is the work of someone who went out The secrets should be between us till... ...the beginning of this bridge!

You both can talk I'll just come back I am not the reason for this. He is the reason for everything. First you understand that. Whatever it is, I'll lose my job. ...and my good will which I got by hard work... ...and my career which helped for you to live for you and the child... Everything will be lost at once. You shouldn't say that it is your duty to help us to live It is your responsibility She is your child too. Is it? That's a new matter for me. But it is for you to blame me for a mistake... ...you have done. He too wished to happen this He wanted to create problems between us than leaking the bridge plan Now he have achieved it so easily Ravi, he didn't take his phone. He called last time to some hotel room I am sure. Ammu will be there See the number. No need code Tell the number! Ravi, he is coming. Have you compromised with your problems? There is a book shop in Rajiv Gandhi bus station You just keep it in the basement - I'll give you one hourtime. - I can't do it. What? I didn't hear Paru, I saw his brothertoday. He was an innocent. But he didn't know that his brother... It's good for you if you stop this matter here Not that. You have a good family Your father is a retired government employee Your sister is working as a lecturer in Engineering college Then why you? Please leave him Ravi! What will be in this box? Let it be anything It is no use to us without knowing Ammu's whereabouts Let's call from my phone No. Your phone may be tapped Let's make a call from the booth Hold it Queens lodge! Where is it? Brother! Wait for sometime. We'll be back now Come soon You are very lucky brother! Ravi! Where is the box? It is in the auto If he wants, let him take that Isn't it a wrong game? Your game is over In your hometown, If I wanted, I would lock you in the car... But you should have thought... ...why I kept my mobile in your car without any reason You were caught in my trap. Why do you do like this to us? Who are you? Didn't you hear the story of Thakshakan? There is no image for the perils Wherever you hide, it'll come and kill you Where is my daughter? I'll tell you Why did you stop with one child? Two children are enough If one child is lost another one will remain Have you done the family planning... ...or has Ravi fed up with you? It is Ammu's I won't stand your stamp. Truly. But sometimes... This 6 feet height and strong physique won't help you If you step a foot forward... ...Beatrice will crush your child's neck like this Parvathy! Do you get scared? Don't close your eyes Ravi Look here! She is enjoying it Why don't you try modeling? You have a great figure As if you are chiseled out! You... The moment when you bring an end for this... The moment when you bring an end to this play... ...l'll kill you I will kill you That's why I've been waiting forthe end of the play Can you bear it? Parvathy! He spoiled my mood!

Am I running a cloth shop to offer you discount? Hey saint! What am I seeing? I thought when you stopped the car that you wanted to breath some fresh air Will you come with me?

Last month there was a dealing like this A wife and husband, and his friend They gave me Rs 2000 He will be yourfriend Sister! There was a bet between him and me I said you'll come if he asks you But he said you won't come! He has lost What is this? Am I a joker in your card game? I wish I could go with Franchise - Take this - No sir! I don't take my fees by sitting idle. It is not your fee It is for my pleasure Will you show yourjoy like this? But some people are there... Shall I go sir? See you Why did you play this cheap game with me? After I entered the car... Did I give you any good reply for your questions? Bright moon eight that's heree Can you guess where we go now? A wild guess Can we see our daughter once? Can we talk to her? It's enough if we hear her sound once I'll do whatever you say Trust me In a man's life, he tells lies to himself Then how can I trust you? Burning heart... Bright moon eight that's heree The eightning strikes in the gardene et is burning in the hearte Red rays... en the sand storm of fate... ...the goeden dream which sheds the petaese ...in the eap of the naturee ...to beossom... where? Parvathy! We've reached the place... ...where we get a conclusion for our problems Parvathy! You stay here You get down Ravi The person who you are going to meet tonight... ...your boss, is inside there Let's clear your today's problems here If you think, the story will end up here What are you saying? Me? To kill? You would be scared to kill But I am not Ammu and Parvathy just started to live their life, isn't it? Do you want to kill me? If you like to happen something to Ammu my presence is not needed. Beatrice is not the only one with me. You should have understood that, isn't it? You have a family with mom, dad and sister... Why do you do like this? They are nothing before my goal! As you said just now How you are here? Has it been changed now? This is my house I should have asked you that How did you find this house? I messaged you. You got that, right? - What message? - What Ravi? Don't you remember what you told me when you called me in the morning? You called me as boss and told me that Parvathy is not feeling well I'll come but I'll get a little late Parvathy is not feeling well You told me like that I thought something was bugging you I messaged you my house address a little later. Then I called you so many times I didn't have my mobile I thought you wouldn't come today Do you have a plan to give me a surprise as you give to Parvathy? That is your plan. Why do you feel nervous? Is it because it is my house? By scaring the people... ...it had been a long time, hiding in the lift and office rest rooms ...we enjoyed But this house is only for us Forthis day, you told so many lies to Parvathy For me, we... We don't want this I know why you are out of mood. Because of long drive, ...guilty feeling, every minute that you are cheating Parvathy Don't I have that guilty feeling? You didn't see that, is it? The surname in the end of my name My husband Venkatesh Now where is he? Didn't I tell you that he went to Delhi this morning? Else how could we meet here? Could you imagine it? What if your husband knows about our relationship? Why do you say so? I can't imagine it. My Ambi will get shattered. Why are you saying this now? He knows everything My child is in his custody He'll kill my child I don't have... I don't have another way to save my child, Devi It is the punishment to us for the sin we have done He wants that I can't sacrifice my innocent child You don't have another way Ravi I can't I can't - I can't kill her - But I can One death is sure Her death is betterthan the death of 6 years old child I can't Did you see how much he loves you? You would have many reasons to tell me ...a husband who always come late Even if I am nearto you, you lose the lusty nights! My busy work Like many reasons In the marriage relationship justifiable things for any women needs It might be correct While spending long time in the office it might happen naturally. It was the admiring on a smart colleague who solved problems in the office Then it changed as love for each other. I can understand that But it was not love. I thought a moment that you wouldn't try to kill her after meeting her But you did it This is not the friendship It is enough for you the warmth when you meet her I thought about her when you fixed a price for that tart Before that tart who sells body for her livelihood. She appeared to my eyes in a small position She is called a tart You too You fixed a price for these two bodies... But when I touched your wife in the hotel room... Do you remember how your face was? Do you remember that pain? By knowing that I am not here... ...you've come to make romance with my wife. Now I've spent my entire day with you You rascal! Can you imagine about my pain? Where is my child? She is safe She is in your house Dad! - Aunty and I played hide and seek. - Is it? Sleep dear! No Ravi! Paru, they together kidnapped our daughter She doesn't know anything That means... Ammu stayed safely in this house Without knowing her dad earned money and career for her She didn't have any role in this game I didn't get you I know. I know everything I am Devi's husband I wanted to talk to you He spoiled not only our money ...but our child's future too Who said that our money has been spoiled? I'll wait here No need of that. I'll come tomorrow Give the slip So, your aim is to be spoil my career. Isn't it? I didn't do that too. Your career is also safe You didn't lose anything Career, money and Ammu. Anything You made me a fool whole day and night Well done - You... - Yes, we are... We thought to make you understand at least one day... ...how the pain is if a loved person betray him When he told everything to me... ...I felt ashamed on myself thinking... ...that I showed my affection on you every moment... ...without knowing another women's smell from you during the nights You didn't lose anything Except one thing Awife who trust your words blindly You don't get her I don't have to say any excuses You can decide I swear Paru, you fulfilled me It has just happened I am notjustifying myself I knew already about the consequences than what I got today I should say - You can decide. - I don't know Ravi Sometimes my mind would pardon you Because it is not that I can't find another way for me Today you suffered a lot for my child... ...and agonized... disgrace You have a good father in you. Only for that Ravi, shall I ask you one thing? Will you forgive me if I were in Devi's place? AFTER ONE YEAR Ravi, come Come Here is the cheque This is a good thing Some decent people will give leftover food for his wife's birthday But you gave big amount forthe trust There is no share in this for me. It is her wish I've heard about this hospital very much. Patients get more affection and care here than home My senior Panikkar sirtells always Patient needs peace than the medicine We are just trying that - Ravi! - What dear? This is a curious case She attempted suicide But it didn't happen. Her husband saved her She is alive. That's all Everyone knows that she can't walk But one man is there who does not believe it. It is her husband! I just told about him. He has come I got the medicine which is prescribed You got, isn't it?
