Hyah! - Move it! Out of the way! Get... Get out of the way! Hyah! Hyah! [WHINNYING] [SHOUTING, GASPING] [WHINNYING] Hyah! Hyah! Hah! [SNORTING] [WHINNYING] Go! Go! Almost got him! - Go! Go! - Over there! Quickly! Hah! - Hyah! - Hyah! Hyah! Hyah! - Get it! - Move! [WHINNYING] Hah! Hah! - Hyah! Hyah! - Hyah! Hyah! [MEN SHOUTING] Get it! You men, go that way. - Lead on! - Hyah! Hyah! Hyah! Hyah! - Hyah! Hyah! - Hyah! Hyah! Hyah! Hyah! [WHINNYING] Whoa. [WHINNYING] [SHOUTS] [GASPS] [SNORTING, SQUEALING] [ROARING] [SHRIEKING] [WHINNYING] [GRUNTING] [BOAR HOWLS] [BODY FALLS] [HORSES WHINNYING] Don't come any closer. I told you to stop. I'm not a wild boar. I'm Frederick von Hohenstaufen, your emperor. You are Barbarossa? Is that what they call me here? Yes. And who are you? I'm Alberto da Giussano, son of Giovanni, Milanese and blacksmith. Well, blacksmith, take this dagger. It'll serve you when you become a man. [HOOF BEATS] - There's the emperor! - Here he is! Over here! [GASPING] - Ho! - We are here, Your Majesty. [HORSES WHINNYING] [HOOF BEATS] [BARBAROSSA]: I'm not so sure this was a good idea. [MAN]: Hildegard von Bingen is a great seer. They say she can even see through bodies and that when she was five years old, she described perfectly a calf that was still in its mother's womb. [BARKING] [PRAYING IN LATIN] [CLAPS] They write their own music. The calf was already dead in the cow's womb. Why this journey? My sovereign and yours is here to seek your counsel. Tomorrow he marries for the second time. He wishes to know if... The wedding is blessed. Her virgin tree is not ripe yet, but the roots are strong. She will bear fruits. Come closer, you... who claim to be king among the kings. Is it written somewhere in my destiny that I will reunite the empire? Listen to my words. Frederick of Swabia... your name... shall be remembered for centuries. But beware. Beware of the water. Beware of the scythe. The scythe brings defeat. The water... brings death. Beware of water. So here she is, the future empress. I just hope that she can make my cousin happier than his previous wife, who was incapable of being loved and even more incapable of bearing him any children. [MAN]: We all hope so. And as you most certainly know, His Majesty has now wished for an heir for too long. I'm afraid he's going to have to wait a bit longer for that. But he can console himself. Beatrice brings the whole of Bourgogne in dowry. [SPEAKING FRENCH] [FRENCH] [GUESTS MURMURING] [MAN WHISPERING]: At least she's prettier than the last one. [WOMAN #1 WHISPERING]: But she's just a child. I didn't realize she was so young. [WOMAN #2 WHISPERING]: Well, at least she will be able to bear children. Promising indeed, the little French girl. Apparently, she can even read. [MAN GRUNTS] [LAUGHING] My father is going to kill me. How are you, Nicola? Guys, you're all wet. What have you been up to? I don't want to talk about it. Where have you been? Evandro was about to leave without you. - I'm sorry, Father. I'm sorry. - Alberto, let's get going. We must reach the river before dawn. I'm sorry, Evandro. [CHUCKLING] [CLICKS TONGUE] [HORSE WHINNIES] [MEN CHUCKLING] Quickly, give them to me. Here. Put them with the others. - The Lodigiani are still sleeping. - Just as well. Leave them snoring. Did you hear that? Hurry up. Give it here. Well, well, well! Look at all these lovely goods. Check. [Sword Unsheathes] what do you want from us? We're not in Lodigiani territory. Now you are not. But earlier tonight, you crossed through it. So you have to pay your dues. [CHUCKLES] [GROANS] Oh, God! Hey! Here you go. - Quickly, get them! - You get that one! I'll get the other! [GRUNTING, SHOUTING] They got me! Go! Go, Alberto! Go! Quick! [LAUGHING] Does he know you love him? What a question. Of course not. [GASPS] Ranero da Giussano is too shy. A little bit stupid, I think. If he waits any longer with all these men buzzing around you... Come here. And you? [SIGHS] No one will ever want me. But it's better this way. I could only love a very special man. [HORSE WHINNIES] [GASPS] Alberto! Oh, my God. Oh, dear. Tessa! [THUNDER RUMBLING] [GROANS] [THUNDER RUMBLING] [WHIMPERING] [HORSES WHINNYING] The Milanese don't waste a single chance to underline their superiority over the other cities. And this dominance worries us, Your Majesty. That's why we are here. The city of Lodi was always faithful to you. It now asks its emperor for help. The Milanese are getting too big for their boots. The time has come to remind them just how sharp the emperor's sword is. One order from you, and the army will be ready to move south within two weeks, Your Highness. No. No! No force yet. Not now. My lord, if you manage to dominate the north of Italy, you'll become the richest and most powerful sovereign of Europe. I'll write them a letter. Call them to order. You take it to them. I come in the name of the emperor. You were warned not to attack Lodi. Otherwise Milan will be banned from the empire. No! You... Gherardo! This is our answer. You've taken one step too many, consul. A step you'll regret. What have you done? - Ranald, don't go! - This is madness! Excellency! Excellency! Gherardo! Now what? What do you propose we do? Let's assemble the army. We will attack Lodi. Goodness. [WHINNYING] [GROANING] Alberto. Alberto da Giussano, son of a blacksmith. This wasn't part of our agreement, was it? [GAGGING] [GASPING, PANTING] We've done it, Alberto! We've won! Lodi has paid for its arrogance. Huh? You're back already? Already? You must be joking, brother. You have slept for four days. [LAUGHS] Lodi has been defeated. We made them pay for their arrogance. Come with us. We're celebrating outside. Come outside. - Come on! Let's go. - Come along! Come along! [HORSES WHINNYING] They're ready. You had no other choice, my lord. It's almost as if they're trying to force me to go to war, and all I want is peace. I know, Frederick, but at this point, you have no choice but to go down to Italy. The Milanese want independence, but you dream of the glory of the universal empire. Destroy them. Destroy Milan, my lord. Someone told me a prophecy once, just before we got married. It was about a scythe and water. Scythe meant defeat. The water meant death. Was it prophecy or witchcraft? I have a prophecy for you too. As a queen, I foresee without any doubt that you will come back victorious from Italy. And as your woman, I foresee that you will miss me terribly. [CHUCKLES] [ALL SHOUTING] [SHOUTING STOPS] [SHOUTING RESUMES] [SHOUTING STOPS] [THUNDER RUMBLING] [DOG BARKING] Whoa! [BARKING CONTINUES] The dogs are restless. They're afraid of thunder. They are not afraid of thunder, Father. Someone is out there. [THUNDERCLAP] Oh, my God! It's you! You frightened me. What on earth are you doing out there in this weather? I want to talk to you. Alone. [THUNDER CONTINUES] What... Well? I'm listening. I'm heading north to Barbarossa's camp. You tell me things I already know. Yes, the, uh... The fact is... There are two females in this home. For which have you come? I'm asking for the hand of your daughter Tessa. Well. Tessa... Huh. Tessa is in age for a husband. You are looking for a wife. It's a start. Maybe a good one. Then you'll speak to her? Yeah, yeah. I'll tell her your intention. I have everything planned. Understood. [CHUCKLES] Until my return. [HORSE WHINNYING] Hyah! Whoa. We are finally here. That's the part of Italy that has to be conquered if you want to reach Sicily, Your Highness. What about Rome? It's right in the middle. It's not going to be that easy. Rome is weak and sick. You just have to wait a little more. [Clearing Throat] How long? That avid and stubborn Englishman that took on the name of Pope Adrian IV has one foot in the grave already. Our cardinals tell me that his successor will be much more malleable. Soon, very soon you will be able to sit on the throne that belonged to Charlemagne. Let's go. [SCREAMING] [CHUCKLES] Gotcha! [WOMAN LAUGHING] Siniscalco Barozzi, he came to our house last night. He asked for the hand of my sister, Tessa. Barozzi's a worm. Barozzi will never take my sister to the altar. And how can you be so sure? Well, I can... I can feel it. [CHUCKLES] So what they say is... is true. You are sort of a witch. No. Wait. Wait! [LAUGHS] I brought you something. Wait. Wait. With this spoon, I'll take care of you for the rest of my life. With this dagger, I'll defend you at the cost of my life. [GASPS] what? What? [WHIMPERING] Hey. What's wrong? Hey! Damn it! [GRUNTING] Oh, this damn thing. [TESSA]: Eleonora. Hey. Are you sleeping? No. I wanted to show you something. Look. He finally made up his mind? Ranero gave me the pledge. Don't tell our father. He keeps telling me that Siniscalco Barozzi is an eligible bachelor and that one day he may even be a consul. Our father would never have to sleep in the same bed with Siniscalco Barozzi. Follow your heart, Tessa. You must follow your heart. Hey! Get some sleep, you two! Tomorrow is another day. My heart has already decided. So this is the way it must be. Hyah! Hyah! Ho. Ho. [HORSES WHINNYING] [MEN SHOUTING] My God. [SOLDIER]: You may go in. I'm to confer directly with the emperor. I'm afraid you'll have to content yourself with conferring with me. I bring Milan's oath of allegiance. Milan is a city with a short memory. - I don't understand. - You do understand. You were there too when that Milanese consul of yours trampled on the imperial seal. I, Ranald of Dassel, was humiliated, made fun of, beaten by your rabble. How dare you? I have also come to apologize. There is no more time for words. Go back to your consuls and tell them the emperor is coming and that this is not going to be a courtesy visit. Listen. Listen to me. There are many noblemen in Milan who are favorable to the emperor. There is nothing more you can do, Barozzi. [SIGHS] [COINS JINGLING] This stays here. Ah. It's true. I am scared. I am scared because I have seen with my own eyes the power of the German army. Their tents covered the entire plain. And they have so many war machines... that our whole square could not contain them. For the love of reason, I implore you, let us surrender. Surrender! No surrender. We will fight! [Scoffs] Soon, Barbarossa's army will be at the gates. You can count the days to the destruction of Milan on the fingers of one hand. [HORSE WHINNIES] [WHINNYING] Every time we come here, they build a bridge for us that is stronger than before. People of Verona respect tradition, Your Majesty. They know that by ancient custom, when a German king crosses their land, it is their duty to build a boat bridge north of the city. And that's why we respect them. - Your Majesty! - What's going on? Watch out! Watch out for the logs! Stop! Stop! [THUD] [HORSES WHINNYING] [SOLDIERS SHOUTING] [THUDDING] [SHOUTING CONTINUES] Go past! Go past! The rope! Tie the rope! Tie the rope! [SHOUTING] Help me! It's a trap! It's a trap! Fall back! - The horses! Save the horses! - The Veronese have betrayed us! Hyah! Hyah! No, Your Majesty! Remember the prophecy! Remember the prophecy! Water brings death! Help your emperor, goddamn you! - Go! - Save the emperor! Tie the ropes! [WHINNYING] Help him! Take the rope! - He's gone under! - Dive down. Look for the emperor! No. Find him! Dive! Dive! Dive! God, no! [ALL CHEERING] Give me your hand, Emperor! [CHEERING] [CHUCKLES] [GROANING] what you have done is very serious indeed. You have allied yourself with Milan against the empire. You have caused the death of many German soldiers. [SWORD UNSHEATHES] You have not respected the tradition that has saved Verona from destruction until today. Why? Why? Today is an important day. I want you to remember one thing. You can only betray your emperor once. [SCREAMS, GASPS] I am as cruel... [SOBBING] as God is full of mercy. [ELEONORA]: Alberto! Alberto! Barbarossa has destroyed the city of Brescia. They say there are over 1,000 dead. How do you know? Have you had another one of your visions? What do you want us to do? Surrender to the Germans? What difference would it make, right? Slaves we were, and slaves we'd still be. We don't want to be slaves anymore. Is it worth fighting a battle that is already lost to begin with? That's enough, woman. We all have to do our duty. Ours is to fight to defend the city! Yours is to stay home and wait for your man to return! If you have one. [SCOFFS] Don't you ever talk to her like that again. Ever. That's enough, Alberto. Alberto! That's enough. [BARBAROSSA]: There they are. Wonderful. I wonder how many cities we have to destroy before they come to their senses. Just one more, Sire. Destroy Milan and all the other cities will bleat like frightened sheep, wanting only to obey their shepherd. Milan. Milan. Milan. The city of Parma greets the emperor. The city of Cremona greets the emperor. The city of Padua greets the emperor. The city of Ferrara greets the emperor. I wonder what's stronger in these people: The will to fight for the empire or to contribute to the destruction of Milan? They're sheep, Ranald. They don't need to think. They just need to obey the emperor. [COWS MOOING] [SNORING] [HORSE WHINNYING] [RUMBLING] Did you hear that? It is like the sound of thunder. But it's not thunder. It's like... Over there! Look! Over there! - Barbarossa! - Barbarossa! Barbarossa! Barbarossa! [BELL CLANGING] Barbarossa! Barbarossa! [ALL CLAMORING] [BELL CONTINUES CLANGING] Move in! Move in! Come on! Hurry! Move! Get the gate closed! Come on! [GASPING, PANTING] [LOUD RUMBLING] Oh, God. I've never seen such a large army. Alberto, let's go. Alberto! Alberto, come on! Hurry up! [GASPS] [GROANING] [GASPING, PANTING] Hurry up! Come on! What's wrong? Don't let your brothers be chosen. I saw the arrows. - Look... - You must prevent this. The Germans are over there. There's plenty of arrows around. What are you talking about? The arrows I saw were not German. [CHATTERING] [BARBAROSSA]: We're ready to move at sunrise. How many of these war machines do we have? About 100, Your Majesty. Unfortunately, the guard towers are out of range. Can we not move them closer? We can't, Majesty. The Milanese have built a defensive ditch along this line. Our war machines cannot move beyond this point. Smart. Any advice? I say we concentrate the fire of our crossbowmen on the walls... to let our men fill the ditch with earth. - I agree. - Yes, a very good idea. The Milanese feel secure inside the city walls. We'll keep them there. We'll block all the gates. We'll starve them. And if they don't surrender... the city will be a grave. [SOLDIER]: Push! Push! [SOLDIERS SHOUTING] Quickly! Quickly! Place the bases! They're getting ready to attack. [MAN]: Take cover! [COMMANDER]: Archers, loose! [ARROWS SLICING THROUGH AIR] Take cover! - Shoot! - Get down! Cover! [GROANS] [COMMANDER]: Barrels into the water! - Take your positions! - Open the ramp for the barrels! Quickly! Quickly! [SHOUTING CONTINUES] Pass those barrels! Keep them moving! Watch out! They're putting barrels into the river. [SOLDIER SHOUTING] To make a passage for the towers. Quickly! Quickly! Move these barrels! [COMMANDER]: Ballast one, fire! - Aim! - Fire! Fire! Fire! Leave them no rest. Deprive them of food and sleep. Their will to fight will diminish day by day. Fire! - Fire! - Fire! Fire! [GROANING] Fire! And reload! [SCREAMING] [CLAMORING] Fire! - Fire! - Fire! - Fire! - Fire! Get out of here! Quickly! - Fire! - Fire! Fire! - Fire! - Fire! [GROANING] Come on! Move! Move! Come on! To the walls! Faster! Faster! Push! Push with all you've got! Come on! Fire! Get down! [SCREAMING] Cover! Faster! [GRUNTING] Come on! [SHOUTING] Run! Come on! Run! Quickly! We'll be slaughtered! Stop! Stop! Here! Stop! Let's line it up! Bring stones! Faster! Faster! Come on! Past the moat! Fifty yards beyond the walls! Ready? Fire! [SOLDIERS SHOUTING] Fire! [SCREAMING] Listen. We need some volunteers. One man per family to go outside the walls and stock up on food. Who will go? You. You. Ah, good. Yes. Young Ranero da Giussano's arm hasn't moved. Or perhaps I didn't notice. Leave him alone, Barozzi. His brother Otto and I are here. Choose one of us. Very well. Since your brother doesn't, shall we say, feel up to it, you will go. No. Let no one say... that Ranero da Giussano was afraid. He said one person per family. Drop it. No, no. Why prevent a brave young man from proving his courage? [HAND SLAPS SHOULDER] Be at the St. Ambrogio grate in half an hour. You leave from there. [PROJECTILE WHISTLING] [SCREAMING] [SHOUTING] Go to the walls! Don't go without a weapon! Get your weapons! - Why'd you have to get... - Don't tell me what to do! Barozzi's already picked me! You wait here! Close the gate. Come back safe. - Fire! - Fire! - Fire! - Fire! - Fire! - Fire! Fire! [SCREAMING] [SHOUTING, CLAMORING] [WOMAN GROANING] Tessa. They should have been back long before now. I fear the worst. Holy Mother, I pray nothing has happened to them. No matter what has happened, I want you to know that I'll look after you. You'll never be alone. Don't touch me! I don't need you. I've promised my heart to Ranero da Giussano, and that's the way it's going to be. And if he doesn't return, I'd rather die than be with you. Listen. [SILENCE] The Germans have stopped firing. - Quick! - What is it? The Germans are attacking! Tessa. Tess... Tessa! [SOLDIERS SHOUTING, GRUNTING] Keep pushing! The Germans are attacking. There are men tied to the towers. They're approaching! Can't you see them? They've tied our men to the towers! - Look what they've done. It's unbelievable. - What are you waiting for? Fire! Don't think about us! [ALL SHOUTING]: Shoot! Shoot! [MEN SHOUTING, FAINT]: Shoot! Shoot! Alberto, tell me what you want me to do. Give them the order to shoot before it's too late! No, Barozzi! We cannot kill our citizens! [PRISONER]: You have to save Milan! - Alberto! - I told you, I don't know! [WOMAN]: What's that? There's something on the towers! [GASPS] Antonia, no, don't look! [MEN SHOUTING]: Shoot! Shoot! - Get them out of here! Get rid of them! Out! - No! You can't stay here! You can't do it! I beg you, don't do it! Please! I beg you! You can't do it! We can't shoot our own men. We just can't. No! No! Shoot us! Shoot us! - No, no! Don't do it! - Please! Please! I'll shoot! [SHOUTS] Shoot! Don't think ab... [INHALING, EXHALING] [TESSA]: No! I beg... Don't look! Don't look! [MEN SHOUTING]: Please shoot! [TESSA]: Please! No! - Don't shoot! - Shoot! No! [YELLING] [ALBERTO]: Father! [SCREAMING] Father! You've got to cover up! Go, go, go, go! Go, go, go! Go! Go! [SOLDIER]: Push! Push! Retreat! Retreat! [MAN]: They're retreating! The Germans are retreating! Damn you! Damn you! My poor child. [SOBBING] Antonia, please! [SCREAMING] [SOBBING] It's clear. Go. [SOBBING] I killed my brother. Don't worry, my son. I killed Otto. [FATHER]: It's not your fault. Forgive me, Father. I've killed Otto. Father. Feel this knife. Feel it. I will go and kill the man who has killed my brothers. I will thrust this in his heart. [THUNDER RUMBLING] - Alberto. - Leave me. Stay away from me. Too many women have already been left without their husbands. Stay away from me! - Don't do it. - I'm just going to inspect the walls. That's not true. I know where you are going. I can see it in your eyes. To whom you are going? Don't talk to me about women losing their husbands. My brothers are dead. Dead! I tried to stop you. Why did you refuse me? Because I was trying to protect you. Yeah? Is this is your way of protecting people? Denying their feelings? Pretending you care? Making them suffer? - You don't understand. - Oh, I understand my feelings. If you love me... If you love me, then don't go. Leave me. [HORSE WHINNIES] [THUNDER RUMBLING] [HOOF BEATS] [HORSE WHINNYING] Where did you get the dagger? You yourself gave it to me. Some time ago. You're the son of the blacksmith. How dare you? You will die for this. You know that. I am not afraid. There are hundreds of young men out there in the city ready to do what I've not accomplished. In a matter of days, your city will cease to exist, and many other men will be dead. I remember you. I've thought about you many times since you saved my life and became part of my destiny. I should call the guards now. [HOOF BEATS CONTINUE] But I won't. I'll let you go. Your days are numbered, old king. Damn you. Alberto. Alberto! Father. Where are your daughters? I can't say. Eleonora made me swear not to tell anyone where she was going. Especially not you, Alberto. [MAN SHOUTING]: The Germans are here! The Germans are here! Who opened the gate? [PEOPLE SCREAMING, SHOUTING] Stop! [SHOUTING CONTINUES] [SOLDIER]: Out of the way! Master Guitelmo! Stop! Too much blood has already been spilled! Master Guitelmo! I've been to your house. Tessa wasn't there. Oh, you watch out, Siniscalco Barozzi. [SPITS] Even the blackest of dogs gets lit by a torch. This dog has teeth. Take these peasants away. Huh? [LAUGHING] Take them away! [GRUNTING] Hold him! I will kill you! I will kill you, Barozzi, if it's the last thing I do! [MOOING] [BELLS CLANGING] [HORSE WHINNIES] Milan has fallen, and Milan is the gateway to Sicily. Not much time will pass before the empire that was of Charlemagne will be yours. [BELL CLANGING] [BELLOWS] [FANFARE] [MUTTERING] [BARBAROSSA]: This is what happens to those who rebel against their emperor. I order Milan to be razed to the ground. None of its towers will ever be standing. I also order all the Milanese to leave the city before sunset in all different directions so that no one will be able to call themselves Milanese and the name Milan will be deleted from all maps. [CHURCH BELLS PEALING] No. Wherever you will go, I will be by your side. [FRENCH] You see? The svevo has a dagger by his side. An armed emperor at a crowning. Unheard of. Why on earth not? A dagger and a crown, if used wisely, can take one very far. All the more so if the pope who crowns Barbarossa is the one that he himself has chosen. [CHUCKLES] [MAN]: Barbarossa! [CROWD CHANTING]: Barbarossa! Barbarossa! Barbarossa! We will revive the old glory of Rome. Rome is at your feet, my lord, as soon will be the south of Italy, the Norman Kingdom. [CHANTING CONTINUES] Barbarossa! Barbarossa! - Guard! Stop! - Yes, Your Majesty? A man collapsed back there. Go and see why. It's the plague, Your Majesty. - Oh, my God. Let's go. - Come. Escort the queen. [CLAMORING, SHOUTING] - Move! Out of the way! - Out of the way! Let the emperor through! [HORSE WHINNIES] Greetings. [GUITELMO]: In the name of God, Lorenzo, look what we have come to. We are forced to meet in hiding as we are outlaws, and with our people starving and having to bear the arrogance of the imperial guards day after day! Yes. And they've increased the taxes on the harvest, again. We must do something! [HORSE WHINNYING] [ALL SHOUTING] [MAN]: Quiet. Quiet! Silence. There is no point arguing amongst ourselves. - What's happening? - It's a secret meeting. I see all the nobles from Milan. We have been starved, forced to leave Milan in six different directions. Who's there? There's Negro and Dell'Orto. Barbarossa has taken away everything from us: Our homes, our work, and also our pride and our dignity. That's why we must react. We must rebuild the city. - Right. - Rebuild the city? Rebuild the city with whom, Gherardo? All around me I see tired, resigned faces who don't want to fight anymore. And Barbarossa is growing stronger every day. Now he's the Lord of Milan. [MAN]: He's right! He's the lord! [BANGING] Barbarossa is the lord because the people of Lombard have accepted the role of servants. - Get back! Get back, I said! - Put down your swords! He's one of us. We can defeat him... if we stay united. Listen. Listen to me. I can still see the towers of Milan crumble... and the looks on our people as they were forced to abandon their homes like dogs. Yet, I can feel the anger and the dismay in Barbarossa's allies. Lombards, like us, who fought against Milan and yet regretted its fate. Because they finally understood that it was our quarrels and rivalries that allowed the emperor to win and enslave us all. Milan would have been destroyed even if the other cities... That is not true! It is true! Think about the strength our swords would have united! Think about the force our swords can have united. You're noble people. Do the noble thing. Do it. This time I'm going to jump with you, Alberto. Whatever you may have in mind. Lorenzo. This meeting is over. Come! Let's go! It's me. [SIGHS] we had another meeting at the Pontida Monastery tonight. We still haven't reached any decision about what to do. Alberto. You live here by yourself? - What is he doing here? - Alberto is, uh... where's your sister? Where's Tessa? - Tessa is dead. - What? What? What happened? Tessa is no longer of this world. There's no use talking about it. [SIGHS] Master Guitelmo, I need your permission to take your daughter out of here. [GASPS] She can't keep on living here alone. - I like to be here alone. - Permission granted. Why did you leave me? Because you hurt me. I was scared and angry. I'm sorry. You treated me like everyone else. Antonia! Antonia! [MAN]: Alberto's back! Eleonora! Eleonora! - Antonia. I'm so happy to see you. - I can't believe it. [CHUCKLES] You've come! Eleonora. I'm so happy to see you. [ALBERTO]: She's living around here. Oh, you're back. I'm so happy. The imperials! [ALL SHOUTING] [HORSE WHINNIES] Get in. Take them in. No. You all know why we're here. - Bastard! - Wait. One third of the harvest belongs to the emperor. Philip. In the cart. Right away, Your Excellency. Men, load the cart. What's in there? [MAN]: Grab everything. It's just a blacksmith's workshop. A blacksmith's shop? With a lock that big? I wonder. [HORSE WHINNIES] [CHUCKLES, CLICKS TONGUE] Hyah! The imperials, they treat us like animals, and we let them do so for a long time. That's over now. We want to be free. Free. Do you know what I mean? We'll look for other young men like us... willing to die for freedom. We'll form an army. Help me. Hold it. [CHUCKLES] This could be our symbol: An iron ring... ... that could bind us all together. [SHOUTING, SCREAMING] [MAN]: It's a sign from God! [WOMAN]: Quickly! Quickly! [SPEAKING FRENCH] [MAN]: It's a terrible omen, Your Majesty. The plague breaking out on the day of coronation. Don't be ridiculous! The plague only broke out because of the heat. [WHISPERING]: Did you see? She interrupted the meeting. Unheard of. Unbelievable. Unfortunately, Your Majesty, everyone will say it's a sign from God. That the coronation itself was a sacrilege. That God sides with Pope Alexander. Oh, stop it now! [MAN]: Did you see? She interrupted the chancellor. God is with you, Frederick. He wanted you emperor of Rome. He wants you emperor of the world. Continue your march south. You can't stop now. [MAN]: It's impossible. Your Majesty, the men are afraid of the plague, and we are losing control of the population. - We must leave this infected city. - He's right. It's true. We have to leave. All right. Tell your men we're leaving. We're going home. That is all for now. Eugenie! Prepare to depart. That's quite a lot of rings, Alberto. Who's supposed to wear them? There's only a few fingers here. [CHUCKLES] Oh, you're wrong, my friend. There are plenty of fingers to fit these rings. You see, I've been thinking about this for many years now. The imperials, they use fear and death as means to divide us and control us. We're all afraid. But if we could turn that fear around and use it as a driving force to unite us all... we could become invincible. After all, what have we got to lose? Death? [ALL CHUCKLE] Death? Death to the imperials. Yeah, death to the imperials. We could become the Company of Death. - Company of Death? - Yeah. It's a good idea. Yeah, the Company of Death. [ALBERTO]: Death or freedom. [CHUCKLES] Death or freedom. Death and freedom, my friend. Yeah. [ALL CHUCKLING] You're gonna get yourself into a lot of trouble one day. [ALL LAUGHING] [WHINNIES] Right there. - You see? - Ottone! Do you remember me? Lorenzo! What are you doing here? Tired of playing games? I told you it's not possible. I'm doing too much already. This prison is full of dirt. No one will notice. Huh? [MEN MURMURING] These two. No, not these two. They nearly killed two imperials. Choose two others. No, I want these two. [LAUGHS] - Who are these? - Who are these? Who are you? We're citizens tired of being wronged. - So what? - Break this. Now break that. [WHINNIES] The humiliation that Milan has suffered over these years has now become intolerable. Brescia will be by your side to help you against the emperor and also to build Milan again. Yes! Yes! We, the people of Mantua, are not just going to stand by and watch. But you all know what the emperor's answer will be. He's right. People will live in terror of retaliation. And what are Lodi or Pavia going to do? I'll tell you what we're going to do. We're going to stick together, united, under a Lombard league. This time we're not going to wait for Barbarossa's punishment. An army becomes invincible with a strong heart, especially with a wounded heart. Go to your cities. Ask the young if they're still willing to live this way. You know what they'll tell you. Do you know? - Better dead than slaves! - Better dead than slaves! - Better dead than slaves! - Better dead than slaves! - Better dead than slaves! - Company of Death, Milano. - Death Bergamo! - Death Brescia! Death Mantua! The land Barbarossa treads on is our land. It belongs to us Lombards ever since we have a memory. We, soldiers of the Company of Death, swear to take back this land of ours, to fight the emperor and never to turn our backs on the enemy. To unite all cities in a league and to defend the most precious of all good: Freedom. Freedom. Freedom! [ALL]: Freedom! Freedom! Freedom! Freedom! Freedom! [FADES OUT] [WHINNIES] [BELL CLANGING IN DISTANCE] [KNOCKS] [GASPS] It's you. Come. Oh, my God, Eleonora. I'm so happy. I'm so happy to see you. I can't believe it. Come on, sit down. So tell me, what forced you to come all the way up here? Alberto and many of the young men from Milan have abandoned their homes and now they're hiding in the woods. And others will join them soon. They have given themselves a name. The Company of Death. The Company of Death? The name makes me think of the evil of damnation. What company are you speaking of? Hundreds. Hundreds of young men, Tessa. They want to give Milan back its freedom. Oh, soon you will be able to come back home, my sister. Do you really think I can come back to Milan? I truly believe that. They're willing to do anything. Anything. Even to die. Are you afraid for Alberto? Are you still in love with him? Yes. And he is with me. He asked me to marry him. But I saw... Don't give in to your visions, Eleonora. Listen to your heart. You must listen to your heart. Go to him and tell him you will accept his proposal. At least one of us can be happy. Eleonora! [GASPS] [WHINNIES] - Now! - Grab him! - Get him! - Stop him! Stop him! [GRUNTING] Get back! It's a woman! Watch out! She's armed! [PANTING] what are you doing here? Hey. Give me the knife. Give me the knife! They're friends in the Company of Death. [ALL LAUGHING] You see. It's getting bigger. What are you doing here on horseback? I was on my way home. Home? Milan is 18 miles that way. - So what? Leave me alone! - Leave us. Listen to me. In some time now, we're gonna have to meet Barbarossa in battle. Some of us will die. Marry me. Now. Stop trying to run away. Why don't you understand? The world we grew up in doesn't exist anymore. Everything has changed. Everything. [WHISPERING]: I love you. [LAUGHS] [ALL CHEERING] Open up! Open the door. We've come for the emperor's share. This is an enclosed cloister. You have no right to enter. Open the door, Mother. My right comes directly from the emperor Frederick. I repeat. You can't enter. Open the door. [GRUNTS] [SCREAMS] [PANTING] What's the matter? What did I do? What's the matter? Hey. Hey. [ALL SCREAMING] Come on, move! - What do you think? - Come on. We'll have some fun here. Search everywhere. - Oh, God. - What's wrong, sister? Everywhere! They all look alike, don't they? But under those clothes, there may be some beautiful women. Mother Superior? Where are you? Mother Superior! I'm here. Tell them to take off their veils. I beg you, in the name of the Lord, what you ask is a sacrilege. If you don't do it, I will. Kill me if you want, but don't ask me to do that. As you wish. What about this one? Huh? Hmm. The quality seems quite low to start off with. Um, this one! Ah. Indeed, this one is not bad. If she had long hair, she would be pretty. What about this one? Look at him. [WHIMPERS] No. No. And, uh... This one. [MAN]: Wow. Yeah. She's really beautiful, sir. Really beautiful. Tessa? Tessa? Is it you? I have prayed for this moment. Tell me what you want me to do. Tell me. Anything. No! [SCREAMING] No! Stop her! Stop her! Stop her! - How dare you! - Stop her! - No! - Come back! Come back! Stop her! Wait! Wait! Wait! [ALL WHIMPERING] - Please! - Stop! Don't do it. Please, don't do it. Tessa. No. No, no, no, no. Shh, shh, shh, shh. Don't, Tessa. I beg of you, please. No. No. Don't. I beg of you. I love you. I love you with all my heart. I love you more than I've loved anything in my life. Stay with me. I'll change. I'll do anything you say. I beg of you. No. [NUNS SCREAMING] Just don't leave me. Just... No! Please. Please. Just give me your hand. Just give me your... [SCREAMS] [SOBS] - No! - No! Tessa! [SOBS] [SOBBING CONTINUES] [SCREAMS] [THUNDER RUMBLING] [THUNDER RUMBLING] [THUNDER CONTINUES] I loved her. I loved her. I loved her. I loved her. I loved her. I loved... [MAN]: She cut his throat! Arrest her! - No! Leave her alone! - She's a witch! You're going to pay for this, witch! [Sobbing] - Alberto! - What's going on, Nicola? Eleonora almost killed Barozzi with a dagger to the throat. - Where is she? - Barozzi is taking her to Alessandria, to Barbarossa's camp. He wants to burn her at the stake. [MAN]: Alberto, don't go! Don't go! [MEN SHOUTING]: Come on! Don't go! - Alberto, don't go! - Let go! Get him down from that horse! Get off me! Let go of me! - Alberto! - Let go of me! - Calm down! - Let go of me! Let go of me! - That's just what Barozzi wants. - Damn it! Let go of me! They'll kill you. Hold him! Hold him! Let go! Leave me alone! Leave me alone! Leave me alone! Damn you! Let go of me! Let go of me! Let go of me! Aah! Get out of here! Out of here! Get away from me! Get away! [YELLS] [YELLING] [SOBBING] [GROANS, SOBS] Hurry up with that. Hurry up. Bring more now. That cart is almost full. Send another. [CONTINUES, INDISTINCT] [SPEAKING FRENCH] Get in there, witch! I survived. I don't think you'll be so lucky. I'm going to watch you burn. [DOOR CLOSES] [BARBAROSSA]: Bad news, bad news. [THUNDER] we've been trying to conquer this city for weeks. How is the tunnel proceeding? Your Majesty, as you know, we can only dig during our attacks in order to cover the noise, and this rain is certainly not helping either. Double the digging. The rivers around the city are full with water, Your Majesty. If they overflow their banks, the whole camp will be submerged. The men are tired. The rain, the mud are destroying our troops. Shut up! We will get into the city before dawn. Make sure the tunnel is ready. [THUNDER RUMBLING] [MAN]: Have no fear. The door will stay... I have no fear at all! Yes. She's here. She's here. - Open the door. - But, Your Highness, uh... Open the door! It's an order! - Do it! - Yes, ma'am. [BEATRICE]: Close the door. You know who I am? You must be a very important person if you give the orders to the guard. I was curious to see the woman who had the courage to slit the throat of an imperial envoy. Next time, my hand will be firmer. There won't be a next time, and you know it. Tell me. Why did you do it? He killed my sister. And because of him, my husband risks his life. What do you mean? Why is he in danger? What happened to your arm? It's the mark of a lightning strike. Lightning struck you and you didn't die? What are you? A witch? Oh, a witch? Oh, get me out of here! [BANGING] Get me out of here! Get me... Open the door! Get me out of here! She's a witch! I don't want to stay with a witch! Get me out! Get me out! Shut up, wench! Get back in there! [DOOR CLOSES] [ALL SHOUTING] Oh, God. They will have no chance. The scythes are exactly at the height of the horsemen. [ALL LAUGHING] Very good, boys. Move quietly. Quiet. Shh. Quiet. Move. Quickly. [CHATTERING QUIETLY] [CHATTERING] [HORSE WHINNIES] [WOOD CREAKING] Quiet. Quiet. Silence. Shh. Quiet. Wait, wait. Get ready. Get ready. It seems peaceful... [BOTH SCREAMING] [MAN]: Get out! Get out! Everybody out! [ALL SHOUTING] - Sound the alarm! - Call the guards! The Germans are attacking! They've built a tunnel! Come on! Get out of the way! Get out of the way! Your Highness, we've been discovered. The tunnel has been closed. [SIGHS] Set all the war machines on fire. We retreat. Damn Alexander and his... city. [HORSES WHINNYING] We're retreating to Pavia. They're loyal to us. We'll be there for a while. There's only one thing you should do. Send messengers to your cousin Henry the Lion. You need fresh troops. He can't refuse to help you. Henry is greedy for land. We've been away from Germany too long. That's a good idea. Let's do that. I'll get ready to pack. One more thing before leaving camp, my lord. Pardon that prisoner from Milan, please. Why are you so worried about some peasant woman? That woman has extraordinary powers, Frederick. They say she's a witch. On her arm, she bears the mark when she was struck by lightning. What is it that troubles you? Lightning spared her. Don't defy heaven. Pardon her, please. If you burn her, she will bring you bad luck. Beatrice, this woman has to be punished. If we burn her, she'll be happy to go. [HORSES WHINNYING] [WHINNYING] Be ready. How are things, cousin? And where's the army you promised me? Look at me, Your Majesty. I'm 46 and full of aches and pains. War is a luxury I can no longer afford. I'm much older than you are, and I'm still willing to fight for the empire. Your Majesty, I'm ready too. [FINGERS SNAP] In there is enough money to pay many men. It is yours, Your Highness. It is my contribution to your cause. Stop it! You know all too well that the emperor doesn't need money. He needs soldiers, an army. Aren't you ashamed of yourself? Your emperor allowed you to have Saxony and Bavaria. He defended you from all the German princes who schemed against you. And now... now that the emperor asks for your help, all you are able to give is some miserable money? Why, what confidence. My cousin Frederick should worry about having a wife that speaks like a man. Yah! [COINS CLATTER] They call you Henry the Lion, but you're worthless. [WHINNIES] Let's go. [WHIMPERING] Ah, give over. [WHIMPERING CONTINUES] Stop your whinging, witch! - I told you to wait for me! - Sorry, Your Excellency. I got a direct order from the empress. It doesn't matter. As long as she burns. Burn. Burn! [WHIMPERING] [SCREAMING] [SCREAMING CONTINUES] - No! No! - Burn. [SCREAMING] No! Men of the Company of Death, we gather here today in a common dream: The dream of freedom. Freedom that is our birthright. Freedom that was taken away from us. It was taken away from us by manipulating us, separating us, dividing us, by fear. But this common dream can unite us. We can mend our fields, walk our lands and raise our families in peace. Let us not fear tomorrow, for to live one day in total freedom means more than a hundred days of slavery! Together we'll go. Freedom! [ALL]: Freedom! Freedom! Freedom! Freedom! [FADES] Halt. Charge! Look. Men of the league. Oh, my God! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Hold. What the hell? Hold the line, boys. Hold the line. Ah. They've seen the whole army. They're afraid to attack. I don't like it. I don't like this maneuver. Your Highness, the Milanese army has taken position roughly two miles from here, on the plain over there. Can you see them? Milanese are stupid. We can handle them. Your Majesty, we were attacked only by their cavalry. We didn't see their infantry. First, we cripple their cavalry. Then their infantry will fall apart. Beatrice, I thank God every night he gave me a woman like you to come home to. My place is where my lord is. Your place today is with the children. Take the empress to Pavia. This is war, my love. Charge! Hold the line, boys. Hold the formation. Not yet. Hold. Hold! Not yet. [WHINNIES] Now! [ALL SHOUTING] Now! Go! Go! Attack! Attack! Charge forward! Forward! What now? Scythes up! [FANFARE] [ALL SHOUTING] Keep going forward! Forward! Forward! Keep going forward! Attack! Attack! [ALL SHOUTING] Charge! Attack! Forward, men! Forward! Forward! You! Ha! No! Lorenzo! Prepare to join your bitch whore sweetheart in hell! No! Look at me! Look at me! No. No. - I want you to see me when you die. - No. Don't kill me, please. Please don't kill me. I want you to hurt. This is going to hurt for all the pain you've given me. For all the pain you've given my family! I have money. You go with my people. Don't kill me. Don't, don't, don't. I beg you. This is for Tessa. Do you feel that? [GRUNTS] This is for my brothers! This one... This one... Look at me. This is for my wife. For my wife. Look at me! Look at me! Damn you! [RAVENS SQUAWKING] Alberto! Alberto. The emperor's horse. I can see it's his horse. Where is he? I don't know. He must be here, somewhere around. Rest assured. I want to see his body. Barbarossa's dead. Give me that dagger. [RAVENS SQUAWKING] I miss her. Nothing. Nothing will give you Eleonora back. But if she were here, she'd like to see you happy. You gave what you wanted. You gave the freedom back to your people. [MAN]: Alberto! Alberto! Come quickly! Look. You're alive. [PANTING] You're alive. Alberto. What are you doing here? - The empress, she... she saved my life. - What? They burned another woman in my place. And you're alive. You're alive. I love you. [MAN]: Freedom. Freedom. - Freedom. - Freedom. [ALL]: Freedom. Freedom. Freedom. Freedom! [ALL]: Freedom! Freedom! [ALL]: Freedom! - Freedom! [ALL]: - Freedom! - Freedom! [ALL]: - Freedom! - Freedom! [ALL]: - Freedom! Freedom!
