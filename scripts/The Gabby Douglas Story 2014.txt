Plant it deep in your heart, then for the next 10 years, eat, sleep, breathe, laugh, and cry without ever taking your eye off your goal. Not even for a second. You want to know how to stop becoming a champion? I actually tried that once. Believe it or not, that was a lot harder. She's still bleeding. Pulse ox 178. Let me see her! Doctor. Blood pressure. Let me see her. Take the baby out of here. Right away, Doctor. No, why can't I see the baby? My mom nearly died the day I was born. The way I heard it later, it was a collision course of everything going wrong at the same time. Tim, go with her! Don't leave the baby alone! But even then, she wasn't thinking about herself. You're gonna be fine. What's wrong with her? Why can't I see my baby? Why can't I see the baby? Why can't I see her? It's called branched-chain ketoaciduria. It's a rare blood deficiency. Tell me what that means. It's a metabolic disorder. A deficiency of the branched-chain alpha-keto acid dehydrogenase complex, which catalyzes the catabolism of the branched-chain amino acids... These are all just fancy words for, "We don't know how to fix "what's wrong with your baby." All right, should be just up ahead. Mom thought a new city would help my dad find a job. But by the time we got to Tulsa, the landlord had given our place away. He kept our down payment, too. And we had so many eviction judgments against us, no one else would rent to us. How soon? By tomorrow. Check out by noon at the latest. We got him to give us an extra hour. Did you tell him we have four kids? Yeah, he knows. Look, why don't you call your mother... I'm not gonna call her again. We've done this enough to her and to the rest of my family. They don't need to know it's gotten this bad again. All right, baby. Hey, honey. Stop jumping on the bed, sweetie. Stop jumping on the bed. Sit down. Gabrielle's getting better, isn't she? Yes, she is getting better. Mom? Yes? How come we had to leave again? Daddy's not working. But this is kind of like camping. If we're camping, then where are the tents? Don't worry. Everything's gonna be okay. Why don't you try to get some sleep? It's too cold. Come on. Come here. Let's get you warmed up and get you thinking about other things. Let me hear you say your prayer. Heavenly Father... We thank you for all of your many blessings, and thank you for watching over us and giving us sweet and peaceful sleep. - Amen. - Amen. Very good. Oh, I love you, sweetie. You told me last week I was... What did he say? He said they can't lend me any more money. It's not what he told me last week. You know, Nat, I should've never have asked. I don't need to sink to that level. You know, I still got my pride. I just got to wait for my ship to come in. That's all. I'm calling my mom. I thought we weren't gonna crash at your mom's house. We're not. I am with the kids. What? I can't do this anymore. You don't mean that, Natalie. I'm gonna get on my feet. You know that. We don't have money for gas. And when the kids wake up, what are we gonna feed them? We'll find something. You know, we'll go on assistance until I can get... No, no, no, no. Don't talk to me about food stamps. That's one thing I will never do. I'm just tired of promises that don't come true. Natalie, where's your faith? God is looking out for us. Please. Scripture says that we... Please! Please. God is not gonna come down from his throne and give you a job. I'm tired of waiting for your ship to come in. I'm gonna get on my own two feet. Hey! Here my grandbabies. Hey! Hey, John! Oh! Look at my babies! Hi! Hey, sweetie! Hey, Arielle. You guys go inside and get some lemonade. Hey, there, little Gabrielle! John, come on and go in the house. You're not gonna be my little bit for too long. Wow, look at her! She's putting on some weight! Yeah, her blood count is practically back to normal. Hey, Mama. She's not gonna be my little bit no more. No. Hey, baby. Well, you know, he can come inside. Yeah, I think he's afraid. Well, I'm not gonna bite him. He's afraid of how he looks in your eyes. You look tired, baby. You should have called me earlier. Come on. Yeah. You hungry? Hey, little bit! Look at my little thing! What? She's getting so heavy! Hey, looks like you got lots of options. Mmm. What's that mean? Mmm? I'm gonna walk into these places like, "Hire me!" And what are they gonna see first? My failures or my desperation? And if they ask for a resume, then what? No husband, four kids, no address. Don't do that to yourself, Natalie. You just freed yourself up so you could make your life different. That was the hard part. Now go make your life different. Hold your head up. Let them see what I'm seeing. Courage. Nobody can stop you anymore. Nobody. I love you, Mom. I know you better. What you got? Oh... Miss Carolyn was right. It took some time, but Mom got a job as a bad-debt collector. Here's a tip. If you owe money, you do not want my mom coming after you. In no time, she was a star employee, and we finally rented a house of our own. Try this. One-handed. I can do that. Watch! Whoo! Gabrielle! Did you see me, Mom? One-handed! Girl, you're gonna break your neck. Did you see it, Mom? Did you? Did you see my shrub? One-handed! But I can do it no-handed. Want to see? It's called an aerial. I can still do it. But I haven't taught you yet. Doesn't matter! Watch! Hey, hey, hey! Get in this house! I know every single one of you have homework to do, so let's go. I can do an aerial. Look at my shrub! Why would you think the shrub would be a landing pad? Here we go. There. "Today should always be better than yesterday." Why that one? Because that, John, is the secret to life. A secret? Mmm-hmm. That's the reason why it's at the top of our vision board. It's like another way of saying, "Don't look back. Move forward." God helps those who help themselves. How do you think we got here? We rented a truck. All right, smarty-pants. God helped us rent the truck. There you go. Put this on the vision board. We are not getting a dog. But, Mom! It will make today better than yesterday. All right, I'll put it up, but only as a metaphor. A what? Um... A reminder to follow your dreams, even though we are not getting a dog. So where do you want to put him? Right here. All right. You put it up there. Okay. You broke it! Did not! Tag! You're it! That's unfair! You're just a slowpoke! Slowpoke! Hey, hey, hey, hey! I'm on the phone. Take that outside. Yes. Hey! Hey! Come back here! Yeah. Yeah, I can do Wednesday, too, if I really push it. For sure. Okay. Thank you. You're it! Hmm. Nice work, Arie. You're moving fast. Ooh! What did she break now? I swear, that child is gonna drive me crazy. You should put her in gymnastics class. Who? Brie? No, I always saw you as the gym star. The leotards on and your hair in a cute bun. We just couldn't afford it. Mom, I've taught Brie everything I know. She just eats it up. Remember when I tried back handsprings when I was nine? Yeah, and I remember you broke both of your wrists. Brie's already doing them. Mom! Look! Whoa! Ooh! Sorry, Mom! You should put her in gymnastics class so she can learn the right way before she hurts herself. Okay, now hit the handstand. You finally get here, and now you want to be shy? It wasn't that. I couldn't believe my eyes. Imagine all your Christmases rolled into one moment. That's what it was like. And I knew right then I was exactly where I was supposed to be. Gabrielle! Brie! Brie, get back here! She yours? Uh... Yeah. I'm sorry. We're here to sign up for the Saturday rec class. Yeah, I don't think so. She's just a little excited. That's all. Oh. No, no, no. What I mean is... I'm sorry. Mrs... Hawkins. Natalie. Natalie, hi. Dirk. No, rec class is just tumbling. It's for beginners. How much training has she had? None, unless you want to count climbing on all the furniture and breaking half of it. None? Wow. TOPs for six months, then Dev. That's what I was thinking. Elite in five years. Mom, look! What's her name? Uh, Gabrielle Douglas. Gabby Douglas. Here's your lunch. I want you to eat it all this time, not just the snacks. Coach said if I do good in TOPs, I'll get invited to training camp. Well. "If I do well." Mom, training camp is with the Karolyis. Mary Lou Retton's coach, Bela Karolyi! Okay, okay. But, listen, Breezy, I want you to eat all your lunch. How are you gonna get strong if you don't eat all your lunch? Here you go. Are you coming? Have I ever missed a competition? Is John gonna be there? John has basketball practice, Arie has cheer practice, and Joy has an ice-skating lesson in half an hour. I got to get them there. See you! Love you, Mom! Bye! I love you, too, Breezy! Never seen a lady in a robe before? Yeah, I don't think this prescription is working any better than the last one. Yeah, the migraines are getting worse. Yeah. Nauseous, light-sensitive. I feel like one is coming on now. Oh. More sleep? With four kids? That's not gonna happen. You got to concentrate. This is one of the most important skills in gymnastics. Why? Because the kip involves coordination, timing, and strength. Now, some of you are having problems with it, but you'll get there. Unless you're too short. As long as you focus on the fundamentals and do your drills. I want to see that... Mom told me life wasn't always gonna be a day at the beach. She said I should let her know if anyone said mean things. But it all starts with concentration. Lucy, show us how it's done. Okay. All right. You need to work on that upper body. Strong finish. Gabby, you're up. But I didn't tell my mom. I had my own way. Yes! Perfect. Now, that's the kip. So, again, if y'all don't have what it takes to master the kip, you don't have what it takes to be a gymnast. So explain this to me again. You're charging the kids money to watch Gabrielle do what? Tricks, flips and cartwheels. You can't take their lunch money! We're not taking it. They're giving it to us. I got $2 for a back walkover. I don't care. Tomorrow, you take this back, and you give them every penny back. What? Mom! No, it's not open for discussion. I need to lie down. What's happening now? Her lights are still off. I think she's crying. It's my fault for taking the money. No, it's not. Is too! Mom said she couldn't afford to send me to gym camp. John and I were gonna raise the money ourselves, and now... Hey. It's not your fault. Mom isn't feeling well. It doesn't have anything to do with you. Besides, if you need money, Joy and I will give up our sports. John, are they tricking me? You got a talent, Brie. We all see that. You've got to start seeing it, too. You could be the best. She's like me, Mom. Yes, she is. Are you gonna be a superstar like her, too? Yeah? Yeah. Well, don't you worry. I am gonna find the money to get you to that camp. Let Mary Lou Retton's coaches see the next superstar. Are you sick, Mom? Mmm. I'm as tough as nails. Don't you worry about me. All right? Now, you go to sleep, 'cause the world is waiting for you in the morning. Good night, sweetheart. Good night, Mom. Time went by. Mom liked us all to have focus and goals, so she liked that the stronger I got, the harder I worked to get even stronger. As long as today was better than yesterday, we were all doing okay. Well, I mean, she's got the drive, and she's getting noticed. The next step is to get her qualified for Junior Elite. Junior Elite? Yeah, she'd be in a higher level and training for harder skills, more competitions. Britney's a Junior Elite. Britney's dad runs a bank. Well, I mean, if you're serious about the sport... What I'm serious about is that my kids have something to believe in. Well, perfect. Then we'll get her qualified for Junior Elite. You'll be on the road a lot more. Probably have to homeschool her. Homeschool? Yeah. Mmm-hmm. 93, 94, 95, 96, 97... Coach! How am I supposed to concentrate here? ...98, 99,100! 101,102... A 14.350 for Gabby Davis, uh... Douglas, rather, the newcomer out of Virginia Beach. Yes! Way to go, Gabrielle! Gabby Douglas continues to impress. That's my girl. And here comes Shawn Johnson, and you can hear the audience reaction. They love her. Hardest vault in the competition. And dead-on! And she is one happy camper right now. That's gonna be you out there one day. Competitions take you to exciting places and closer to your dreams. But they also expose your doubts. 206. Here we go. Wow! Breezy, you have moved up in the world. I suck at bars. This is the nicest hotel we've ever been in, and you're too busy giving yourself a pity party that you don't even notice. Keep focusing on the negative, and it'll come true. Oh! Come look at this view! Mom! I came in 16th today. I didn't make the National Team. What if I never make the National Team? Not this year, or the next year, or the next? Do you think before she won Shawn Johnson never had a bad day? Well, I promise you, she did. How do you know? Because, sweetie, anyone who's ever reached for something, they've had a bad day. Gabrielle, you are 12 years old. Look around you. Look at this place we're staying in. You're at a national competition. But you know what? If you're not having any fun, let's forget about this, go home, sell your leos on eBay. No! Well, it doesn't look like you're having any fun. There you go. So, what do you think? A hotel like this probably has a really nice bathtub. 'Cause I wasn't gonna say anything before, but, hoo, girl, you're kind of ripe. I earned it. Yes, you did. Let's go run you a bath. Okay. Is my nose too flat? Did somebody tell you that? Because you have my mama's nose. Are you saying that Miss Carolyn's nose is too flat? No. Okay. 'Cause she has a perfect nose, just like you. Did I really get Miss Carolyn's nose? Absolutely. And you got my smile. You're just like a little jigsaw puzzle of all of us, and somehow you got all the best parts. Mom? Yes? Can we get a dog now? No. Just a small one. Do you have wax in your ears? Let me see those ears. Oh, yeah, there's some wax in here. I got to wash it out! Zoway! Zoway, Zoway! Come here! Don't get him excited! You know he's already wild. Are you wild? Huh, boy? You wild? All right, now, you have to take him for a walk, because I have to go to work. You'll be back for tonight, right? I will try. Try? Mom, it's the Olympics. Olympic Trials, and I know. You've had it circled on the calendar for over a year. I will be there. Okay. All right. Bye, Mom. Love you! Don't be late! Bye! Love you, Brie! Bye! There she is, Shawn Johnson. This is a multi-layered story, Shawn Johnson. You saw her coach there, Liang Chow, came from China. Opened up Chow's Gymnastics, and one day, in walked Shawn. At that very moment, he knew they had a future. I thought it was smoother than the Nationals. Yeah, phenomenal. One of the most difficult routines being done in the world. Has the highest degree of difficulty for anyone in this meet. And on top of that, coming in with brand-new choreography. It takes time to own your own routine and to feel really comfortable. Gabrielle? Are you okay? That's my coach. What are you talking about? I'm going to the Olympics, and Liang Chow is gonna be my coach. The Olympics? I wanted to stand on the Olympic platform. I wanted to be the best in the world. I could close my eyes and see it. Problem was, who believes a little kid could have a dream so strong it would eat you alive if it didn't come true? No one. That's who. But it was a dream that wouldn't go away. It just got stronger. I knew it was time to make everyone else believe in me, too. All right, come on, everyone. Let's clean up. Let's go. Coach! I can do the Amanar vault. I'm ready. You're still not getting enough height on your takeoff. One wrong landing, you blow your ACLs, and that's it. Your career's over. Well, I can get more height. Just show me. Stop rushing everything, Gabby. I don't think you're ready yet. Well, if you don't believe in me, how am I supposed to get anywhere? Like the Olympics? Ashley, grab those mats. Gabby, be patient. There's time. Stop worrying about the Amanar. You have a competition coming up. Focus on that. All right? You got it. You got it, Gabby. One of the rising stars of the sport. Every competition, she seems to come out a little more polished. Absolutely. You know, you can really sense the confidence here. I think this is gonna be one to watch. Really good form here. And she really keeps those lines. This dismount's got a high level of difficulty. Yes! What a strong finish. Really sticks the landing. Look at her. Look at her. She knows it. She is beaming. Well, that was a surprise, huh? I didn't think you were gonna pull that off. All right. What's that supposed to mean, he didn't think I'd pull it off? I'll get it. He's my coach. Isn't he supposed to believe in me? But he's always like, "No, you're not ready for this. "You're not ready for that." - Well, I believe in you, Breezy. - Hello? You're not my coach. I bet Coach Chow doesn't say that. Oh, boy. Now we're gonna be talking about Coach Chow for the rest of the night, huh? Well, I bet he doesn't. Mom, it's the pharmacy. All right. Coming. "Coach Chow. Coach Chow." Arie. Come on. Leave her alone. The pharmacy? It's nothing. I just have to have my prescription changed. Is it hot in here to you? Um... Could you hold my place, please? I'm gonna go sit down for a second. Uh-huh. Sure. Right. Next, please. How do you have a bad reaction to medicine? Isn't it supposed to help you? I don't know, Gabrielle. Well, what does it mean? I'm not a doctor. It means she has to stop working so she can rest. Mama tell you that? Stop working for how long? They're here. John. Arielle. Come help me get your mother in the house. I got it, baby. I got it. Take your time. You okay? Yeah, I'm all right, sweetheart. Listen. Your mom had a bad reaction to her medication, but she's gonna be okay. I don't want y'all to worry. But it could be a while before she gets back on her feet. She's not allowed to work. So money is gonna get real tight in the next few months until her disability kicks in. Okay? John? Brie, what are you doing here? Don't you have a practice to go to? It's too expensive, Mama. And we're poor. Do you know what poor is? Poor is when you run out of hope. And that's not us, not by a long shot. You want to make me feel better? Then go to practice. You got a competition coming up, and you need to be ready for it. 'Cause I'm gonna be at that competition. I don't know about you. You plan on being at that competition? Yeah? Well, go get ready. You're on your own In a world you've grown Few more years to go Don't let the hurdle fall So be the girl you loved Be the girl you loved I'll wait So show me why you're strong Ignore everybody else We're alone now I'll wait So show me why you're strong Ignore everybody else We're alone now Suddenly, I'm hit Is this darkness of the dawn? And your friends are gone And your friends won't come So show me where you fit So show me where you fit I'll wait So show me why you're strong Ignore everybody else We're alone now We're alone now I'll wait We're alone now We're alone now I'll wait We're alone now We're alone now Suddenly, I'm hit Is this darkness of the dawn? And your friends are gone And your friends won't come So show me where you fit So show me where you fit Mom, what is it? They used to call them food stamps. It looks like a debit card. Well, it's not. When you guys were younger, I vowed I would never, ever rely on another handout. Nice! Come on, Kelly! Keep your legs straight this time. Please, Mom! What are the chances? I mean, it's a sign or something! Coach Chow right here. It's fate or something, or something meant to be, or... Are you gonna peel that, or are you just gonna keep waving it around? Please, Mama. I mean, I know it's more money, but what if it is fate? Mmm. What are you gonna say when you first meet him? You mean I get to go? Oh, my God! I'm gonna tell him he's my hero, and I've waited my whole entire life just to meet him, and I'm gonna show him everything that I can do. You're gonna breathe. You're gonna breathe when you talk to him. All right, now, peel these carrots, girl. And I'm gonna tell him I've waited two whole years to meet him. I'm gonna tell him there isn't anything I don't want to learn as long as he'll teach me. Hello. I am Liang Chow. Hi. I'm... I'm Gabrielle Douglas. Hello, Gabrielle Douglas. What do you hope to learn today? Everything. I don't know about everything, but I'll try not to disappoint you. Hi. I'm Liang Chow. I'm Ashley. Hi, Ashley. Let's talk about music, okay? You're probably thinking, "Music? "I thought Chow was going to teach me gymnastics!" Well, what if I told you all gymnasts are musicians, and these are your instruments? Rhythm, and tempo, the steady beats, and then the crescendo! Today I'm going to teach you how to play these instruments. How many of you do doubles? How many of you are ready to learn the Amanar? You, step out. You can do a double twist? Sure. Show me. Okay. Yes! Lots of power! I like that! The Amanar was named for the first gymnast who did it, Simona Amanar. It's one of the hardest vaults in the sport. Not only is it two and half twists in the air, which was considered impossible before Simona did it, but it's a blind landing. You cannot see the mat before you hit it. The vault's sound is fast, strong, short notes, power. Think of a drum. Hmm? Now, give me the double twist but stay in for the other half turn. Okay. Mama! Mama! He taught me! Mama, Coach Chow taught me how to do the Amanar! I did it! I did the Amanar! Okay, okay! Calm down! You act like the world's about to end. All right. Tell me again but slowly. Mama, he taught me one of the hardest vaults to do in just a few hours. Well, congratulations. It sounds like you got something out of that clinic. No! That's not the point. If Liang Chow can teach me that in two hours, just think what else he could teach me. I have to train with him. What? I want to move to Iowa and train with Coach Chow. Good one. For a second there, I almost thought you were serious. But I am serious. Brie, please. Mama, please! He lives in Des Moines, Iowa! Do you know how far away that is from here? Go look it up on the map. I don't think you realize that's over 1,000 miles away from here. Mama, I want to train with Liang Chow! And how would you get there, Gabrielle? Where would you live? It's impossible. It's not! Oh! And you have chutzpah. Do you know what chutzpah is? Go look that one up, too. Mama, don't laugh at me. I'm going to train with him. I don't care what you say. Gabrielle Douglas, who do you think you are talking to? You better watch your mouth, young lady. Talking under your breath like you're some spoiled brat. Get up there and go wash up for dinner. You done lost your mind. All right, let's try that again. Come on! Gabby! Pick up your feet. When you hit the mat in the Pak salto, that's five-tenths off your score. Try it again. It's not working. I've tried it 20 times. Well, maybe you're not trying hard enough. Let's go. I wanted to jump up and yell right back, "Maybe you're not teaching me right." But I wasn't raised that way. And then a mix-up with Chow's ride to the airport gave me my last hope. My mom offered to take him, and I knew that by the end of the ride, she would have gotten to know him and realized I was right. My daughter is very driven. Better that than her driven parents. No offense. Mmm. None taken. I believe in letting all my kids make their own choices. So, who inspired you? Your mother? Coach? Neither. I was taken out of my school at five and put into a state program for gifted athletes. In China, it's called "juguo tizhi." It means "whole nation system." I only saw my family three times a year. Hmm. You must have missed them. Of course. But even at that age, I knew I had to make my country proud. Life isn't always easy in China. It's not always easy here, either. I can tell you some stories. What do you mean, small talk? Like how he came to America, about his family. What about training me? Gabrielle, he lives in Iowa. We live here. Mama, all that time together, and you didn't mention the most important thing in the world? Help me fold these clothes, Gabrielle. It isn't fair! Gabrielle, we're not gonna keep doing this. Here. You fold your leos. Think about something else. No, I'm not gonna fold my leos. I don't need them anymore. If I can't train with Coach Chow, then I'm not gonna do gymnastics. What's the point? I quit! And I don't want dinner ever! Well, you know what? You don't have to eat then. A hunger strike? Well, you got to give her points for that drama. She hasn't spoken to me in a week. Oh. Gosh. When she gets her mind set to something, it's like... Where does she get that from? Excuse me? Are you kidding? You better look in the mirror, girl. No. No, no, I'm stubborn, but Brie... No. That's a whole... She's just, like, beyond. It's like she was put on Earth for this one thing. Sometimes I lay in bed, and I ask God, "Why? Why her? Why my little Boo Tookie Boo?" She was so sick and nearly died that first year, and out of all the little girls in this whole, wide world, she was picked. And is it a gift or is it a burden? You know, you're the only one who can answer that. Mom, I got four kids, and I'm barely keeping it together. Here she is, this force of nature, with dreams as big as the sky. Well, I remember walking in those shoes myself not too long ago. You wanted to be a lawyer, and until Arielle, it was what you lived for. And you would have made a great lawyer. Hmm. But I'm gonna tell you. There's nothing worse for a mother than seeing her child's dream go unanswered. Mom, I can't afford to send her to Iowa. And you can't afford not to. You see one yet? No. Some little ones over there, but nothing's moving. I bet there are a lot of stars in Iowa. You aren't going to Iowa. You might as well stop thinking about it. Why would you say that? Well, 'cause for one, we live here. Two, you can't afford to get out there. Three, even if you could afford to get out there, you got no place to live. Four, I mean, if you went to Iowa, no one would be able to take care of you like I could. Five... Are you saying you're gonna miss me? You would, wouldn't you? Hey, now, cut it out. Is that one? No, that's just a plane. Hmm. As it turns out, my prayers were being heard, and I didn't even know it. 1,000 miles away, a family who didn't even know me was about to change my life. Some people don't believe in miracles. If you find a girl who needs it... And we've already got the four girls, right? I mean, what's one more if it means helping someone reach their goal? Got the room. Thank you. They call it a coincidence or luck. No, sir. Not me. When an impossible array of stars all line up just so one puny, little human can reach out and grab ahold of her dreams, it isn't just luck or a coincidence at work. It's something much bigger watching out for you. Call him, Mom. I just don't know how we would do it. I mean, money's already tight. And then on top of that... What are you doing? I'm calling him for you. Okay, we walk by faith, not by sight. Isn't that what you've told us our whole lives? Yes, it is what I've taught you... It's ringing. Hi. Yes, this is Natalie Hawkins. I'm calling to speak with Coach Chow. Sure, sure. I'll hold. Yes, of course I remember her. Hmm. Mmm-hmm. No, I understand, not everyone could just pick up and move to Iowa. Your daughter's an exceptional athlete. I would... Mrs. Hawkins, if you... Can I just stop you for a minute? Believe it or not, I think I might have a solution for you. They would let Gabrielle stay with them? For two years? A family might host her. She would have a place to live. Um, yeah, I'll talk to her about it when I pick her up this afternoon. Okay. All right. Thank you. Seriously? Some family wants to do something nice. Oh, my God. Wow. That's incredible. What did I just do? That whale's never gonna fit. Okay. So, do you like this sweater, or do you like this one better? I don't know, Brie. Just pick one. You are not gonna be able to pack all this stuff. Ah! I can't believe it. Breezy, you're really going. Iowa! Don't look at me like that. You're gonna make me cry. I'm really gonna miss you. Come here. I love you. I love you. Are you bringing that sweater? I told you not to pack that. What do you pack when you're leaving home for the first time in your life, and no suitcase in the world is big enough for what you want to take with you? You're living my dream. Do you know that? So, go up there and be your best, okay? Come here. Bye, Joy. Gonna miss you. I'm gonna miss you more. John. Oh, come on. Don't be like that. Brie. Brie. He'll call you later. This is tough for him. We got to go. We don't want to miss our flight. Bye, Zoway. Don't forget me when I'm gone, okay? Where is everything? Zoway's gonna forget me. He won't forget you, sweetheart. Two years is a long time. Yes, it is. Coach, watch this! Nice! How was my line? Come on. You did it in competition. You can do it again. - Don't step forward. - Got it, Coach. Ella, you're about to dismount. Concentrate. Gabby. This is my wife, Li. She'll be coaching you, too. Welcome, Gabby. My husband has told me so much about you. Now that you're here, what do you think? Oh, it's... I can't even say. But it's what you wanted, right? I want to go to the Olympics. And I want to win. You haven't given us much time. London is just 22 months away. I'll give you 100% every day. I'd like to speak candidly. Do you mind? Please. Every single person you see here has the same dream, to go to the Olympics. That little girl, she's been with me three years now. Her parents told me that the first sentence she spoke was that she wanted to win at the Olympics. I believe she'll get there one day. And me? I see the possibility of you getting to the Olympics, but I can't guarantee it. Your difficulty level and physical condition need a lot of upgrading. I don't know how hard you're really willing to work. Oh, hard. I promise. Just... Just believe in me. We'll start tomorrow. You'll be doing 28 hours per week. At home, I do 36, and I'm willing to do a lot... I have my way. Believe in me. You must be Gabby. I'm Sally, and this is my husband, Brent. Welcome to Iowa. We are so grateful that you are gonna let us be your host family. Is that her, Mommy? Yes, it is, princess. This is Jessica, one of our girls. And this is Jill, and our oldest, Connie, and our youngest, Beth-Anne, and you met Jessica, right? So, how was the... You have a love... Oh, you first. I was just gonna say, you guys have a lovely home. Thank you. Okay, so, who's hungry? Me! You guys are always hungry. All right, to the kitchen. Come on in. Come in. Already beating us there. We are grateful for bringing us together. And we want to thank you, Lord Jesus, for bringing Gabby into our home. And, God, please bless our food. In your name we pray. Amen. ALL: Amen. You girls are gonna give them some time alone, okay? Is this a good idea? 'Cause it's not feeling like I thought it would. It's what you wanted, Brie. Mama, nobody said Iowa doesn't have any black people. I'm sure there's more of us somewhere. Don't go. It's too late for you to have a change of heart now, baby. This will be the hardest part, sweetie. Tomorrow, you'll be in your element, where you belong. I'm so proud of you, I could pop. I love you, my Boo Tookie Boo. Mama. Oh... One more hug before I start bawling my eyes out in front of all these nice people. I love you, sweetie. I love you. Study this closely. These are the dates that are going to control your life for the next two years. This is today. And this is the London Olympics. But you can't get there unless you win here, the US Olympic Trials. There will be competitions throughout the year. They're all important. But the road to there really starts here, the Visa Championships. And starting now, you have to forget everything you thought you knew. Because I'm going to rebuild you muscle by muscle. Yeah, you can be the greatest You can be the best You can be the King Kong banging on your chest You could beat the world You could beat the war You could talk to God, go banging on his door You can throw your hands up You can beat the clock Yeah You can move a mountain You can break rocks You can be a master Don't wait for luck Dedicate yourself and you gonna find yourself Standing in the hall of fame Yeah And the world's gonna know your name Yeah 'Cause you burn with the brightest flame Yeah And the world's gonna know your name Yeah And you'll be on the walls of the hall of fame You can go the distance You can run the mile You can walk straight through hell with a smile You could be the hero You could get the gold Breaking all the records they thought never could be broke Yeah, do it for your people Do it for your pride How you ever gonna know if you never even try? Do it for your country Do it for your name 'Cause there's gonna be a day When you're standing in the hall of fame Yeah And the world's gonna know your name Yeah 'Cause you burn with the brightest flame Yeah And the world's gonna know your name Yeah Mom was right. Saying goodbye to her was the hardest part. Before I knew it, months had passed. I gained 10 pounds, and it was all muscle. Every skill I thought I knew was rethought. Routines I never believed I could do became second nature. With Chow, I competed against the best gymnasts in this country and internationally. Then it was time to put it all together. The Olympics were just a year away. The Visa Nationals were the first of the competitions that would decide who makes the team. As Chow said, it was make it or break it time. Right here, Gabby. Your body shouldn't be hollow here. You need to open up a little more in your rib cage. When you push off here, your ankles will be springs, but your spine reaches, like this. Hmm? Mmm-hmm. And don't be so serious. Don't force your body to do what it already knows. Relax, right? Focused but relaxed. So grace can enter the skill. Right? Let me see. Yes, Gabby! Like that! Again. Gabby! Gabby! Don't move. Don't move. Don't move. Get some ice. It's her hamstring. In my mind, I kept hearing the sound of my hamstring popping. It was the sound of my dreams starting to unravel. Gabby? I can't fall behind. Coach Chow told me to rest tonight. Don't tell him, okay? What is it? Pure determination, dressed up like a teenager. I don't want to foreshadow anything here, but she has not just this week, but in warm-ups today, really had a tough go on the beam. Come on, Breezy girl. Come on. Let's go. Gabrielle, we're not gonna keep doing this. Unless you're too short. But it's what you wanted, right? And the momentum is really not going the right way for her tonight as well. Another big skill. This is one of those meets that is, quite frankly, very hard to recover from. It's not just a matter of, you know, having some problems. This is letting it really get to you and letting the emotions completely control your actions, and just badness all around. Another competition, and you'll get your confidence back. It's not that. It's just... It was make it or break it time, and I let everyone down. No, you did not let anyone... I saw it in Chow's face. After everything everyone's done for me. My sisters, they gave up their sports just so I could do mine. And my mother... We were on food stamps, and she always found a way for me to keep training. They're all real proud of you, honey. Nobody... And my brother... I'm, like, his best friend, and he's mine, and I left him. I let everyone down. Sports isn't always about winning, Gabby. It's about finding out who you really are. Sometimes the only way to get stronger is to get knocked down. Your mom is gonna be here in four months. Isn't that something to look forward to? She's pretty darned excited. It's all she talks about. Heck, we're all pretty darn excited. We're really proud of you, Gabby. As those four months went by, I had the aching awareness that who I really was did not belong there. And after a while, I couldn't think of anything else. Who I really was wanted to go home. Concentrate, Gabby. Think of the skill piece by piece. The key is to keep your hips square. Hmm? Again. Where are you going, Gabby? Don't do this. Gabby! Gabby. I know how hard it can be. For two years, you've trusted everything I've told you, right? Now trust this. The only thing harder than what you're feeling now is quitting. It's not working. What isn't working? Everything. You can be the best in the world. Did you hear those words? "Best in the world." But you have to block out all of the distractions and believe in yourself. Stay and work this out, and you will be an athlete who inspires nations. Walk away, and you'll be sitting on the couch watching someone else win your Olympic medal. You'll regret this the rest of your life. Following my dreams was supposed to lead me to who I really was. But who I really was, was lost. Gabrielle, Coach Chow said you were looking for me, said you wanted to talk to me about something. Uh-uh. Uh-uh? You weren't looking for me? No. Talk. I can't talk about it. Is everything okay? Can we go someplace quiet? What's going on? I didn't have the nerve to tell you, so I wrote it. The Olympics are exactly 210 days away, and you want to quit? Is this a joke? No, I want to go home. Gabrielle, is there something going on here that you're not telling me about? Then you're gonna have to do better than, "I want to go home." Because this is not making any sense. I just want to be normal, Ma. Baby, you weren't born to be normal. Everything you've done your entire life has been exceptional. No. No. You are not gonna quit. No. You have worked too hard for this, Gabrielle. We have sacrificed so much for this. And now you want to quit? Exceptional people don't just quit. I don't want to be exceptional! I don't want to go to the Olympics! Does Coach Chow know? No. Can you tell him? Oh! Oh! Oh! Gabrielle! You signed a contract. What you're doing is dishonorable. If you want to quit, you tell Coach Chow yourself, and after that, you tell everybody else whose heart you're gonna break. And I've told her, look at all the people that have sacrificed for you, Sally and Brent, your brother and sisters, your entire life, Miss Carolyn, me. I know, Mom! I can get a job and pay you back. No, Gabrielle, you cannot pay me back! Paying me back would be following through on your life's dream, and you just want to throw it all away! You think there aren't other little girls out there who miss their families? She is gifted. One of the best in the sport. I know that. And she knows that, too. But an Olympic athlete is more than talent and muscle. If she doesn't have it in her heart, it isn't there. We can't teach it. You can't force it. And even Gabby can't make it any different. A champion isn't made of muscle. A champion is made of heart. We'll give her some time to figure this out. If she wants to quit, she will. Meanwhile, she's been accepted to the AT&T American Cup. She's just an alternate, so the points won't count. There won't be any pressure on her. Stupid. What did you just say? Did you just call me stupid? Yeah, what do you think it's called when you give up for nothing? It's not for nothing. I want to come home. You're living your dream. You can't give up now. I know, but... No buts, okay? I mean, athletes don't whine and complain. My coach brings me through hell and back, and you know what? I love it. 'Cause it makes me better. Now, you got to tough it out. It's the life of an athlete. John, I want to come home. I want to be with everyone. Brie, listen to me. Are you listening? Mmm-hmm. You are with everyone. I mean, we're right there with you. And when you go up there to get your medals, we're gonna be right up there, too. Can't you see that? You're winning for all of us. You didn't think you were doing it all on your own, did you? Look, you get that thing that I sent you? The thing I'm not allowed to open? Yeah. You can open it now. "Today should always be better than yesterday." It's our family saying, Brie. If you live by that, then we'll always be together. 'Cause no matter where you are, you can take us with you. You get that other thing? All right. Now put it on the board where you can see it. Don't quit on us, Brie. And again. Okay, and point the toe more. Good. What's the most important thing about gymnastics? Beautiful! The most important thing about gymnastics is, it's fun! Yes! And what we're seeing here tonight, well, 21 weeks before the Olympics, Gabby Douglas isn't even officially competing. Right now, she's leading the top two US gymnasts in this competition. She's attempting the two and a half here. It's also called the Amanar vault, one of the hardest in the competition. It's her first time trying it in exhibition. Ooh! She nailed it! Gabby Douglas! And right from the first workout here in New York, we knew there was something very different about Gabby. The growth in this young lady is absolutely spectacular. Watch this dismount. Leading the top two US gymnasts by a full two tenths as an alternate, this is one for the storybooks. And here it is, her final pass. You can feel the excitement in here. Well, it all comes down to the Olympic Trials in three months. Can she do this again when the points count? Good. Good. Less kick here. You were a little late on the release. What if I can't? The bars have become your best event. You've done the high release a million times. No. What if they're right? What if I do cave under pressure? What if the bar just wasn't there? You can't think of it like that. I'm going to tell you the secret of gymnastics. Now? Why not two years ago? You weren't ready then. You can't think of it as release the bar, catch the bar. There's no release. There's no catch. Because it's all one. When you are in your moment, when you are doing exactly what you're supposed to be doing, it's all one. You are not reaching for the bar, because you've already got it. Know that in the deepest part of your being. There's no past, no future. You are the bar. You are the air. You are the catch. You are the eyes on you. It's all one reality. Every moment of your life has led to this. It's all part of this. You are not separate from the skill. You are the skill. And it's all part of the same perfect moment. Sounds like fate. Maybe. I call it gymnastics. Four skills. Four chances to show they've got what it takes to represent the USA in the Olympic Games. For each of these athletes, it's a lifelong dream. There's no past, no future. It's all one reality. You are not separate from the skill. You are the skill. Every moment of your life has led to this. Gabby Douglas takes the top spot in these Trials and will be representing Team USA in the Olympics! USA! USA! You did it. We did it. We love, Gabrielle! We love you, Gabby! This girl is on fire Fire, fire This girl is on fire She's walking on fire Fire, fire This girl is on fire Oh Everybody stares as she goes by 'Cause they can see the flame that's in her eyes Watch her when she's lighting up the night Nobody knows that she's a lonely girl And it's a lonely world But she gonna let it burn, baby, burn, baby This girl is on fire Fire, fire This girl is on fire She's walking on fire Fire, fire This girl is on fire She's just a girl and she's on fire
