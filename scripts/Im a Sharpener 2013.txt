Hello, my name is Harris Harris Tindall, I'm 28 and I've been living in Paris since I was a child. I was born in England. I do love France but I have to admit sometimes I miss London. It must be in my genes! Good. What do you do for a living? I'm a pencil sharpener. I get it from my father, who himself got it from his father, whose father also had it from his own father. It's a beautiful four-generation family tradition. Let's get to our subject. How do you adjust a pencil? You have to fit it to its owner. The writing is a manifest of one's personality. And the temper can fully express itself It the pencil is adjusted, the hand is free. My father use to say a pencil is the visible side of the personality! What can I do for you? I feel I could improve my use of pencils? Can you write something down? What could I write? Our tagline. We sharp with meaning you write with sense. - Is this ok? - Perfect. What can I do for you? I need them to be very sharp. As always, as sharp as possible. That's how, I get the best result with precision. Precise! Sharp. - It's important to me. - Alright, I understand. - Are you sure? - Absolutely. Can you write something down? - The usual tagline? - Yes. I've been feeling a little rigid lately. I wish I was more. Cool! I always ask myself tons of questions. I never know what to choose from a white brown, figs or cereal loaf of bread. It can last forever. - I see. - That's why I'm here. If my pencils were sharpened in a more rounded way, maybe I would become flexible. Be assured, you have a beautiful personality. Can you tell me about your clients? Vast subject matter! Each one of them is unique. Let's look at one particular case. I am supposed to be bound by professional secrecy. So talk to us within this secrecy. There is this young lady. Her writing is full of grace and neat. Are you Harris? I've been told you do wonders. I hope so. Have a seat. - What's your name? - Mankiev Elisa. Not supposed to ask a lady's age. I'll just write 30. What brings you here? Hard to tell, it could be chance. I doubt people come here by chance. But in any case Can I borrow your hand? Now, can you write something for me? What should I write? Whatever you want. Perfect. You're probably right, there is no such thing as chance. It's a very natural writing, letters fit together perfectly well it shows she didn't do it on purpose. Some people change the way they write consciously: They cheat. She's not like that. Always sincere I can feel her fragility in some alterations of her writing. Her letter formation rises and translates her moods. Sometimes more or less nervous, rigid or arched. They flicker as if each letter could fall over. What do you use your pencils for? If what people say is true, you should have found out. I think you're a writer. Good guess! I am impressed. Wow, gays just get right to it. I haven't figured out what you write. And? To be honest, I I wonder everyday. Everyday? Seriously? She's been coming here for 8 months and and I have witnessed many different moments with some distance happy times. Sad ones. I've seen her writing change. I have traced down the chart of 8 months of her life. She is very fragile and requires attention. I have to admit you surprise me. Why is that? You're always the same. Week after week, same temper. What did your father use to say about pencils? The visible side of personality. I want to discover your invisible side. What about yours? I'm looking for it. That's why I'm here. By chance! This time it's a valid answer? Goodbye Harris the Iceberg. It's as if we were intimate. I know her so well. It's difficult not to cross the line not to go beyond my role when sharing her life, Even though I'm not with her. Thank you Harris. We may cut some of it. But it was very beautiful. Cut! I should have used the past for everything I've just said. - You seem worried. Everything ok? - I'm ok. I should change them. Time's passing by Harris. What happens when people change? I adjust their pencils. It's normal for people to change. My pencils help them to move forward. And when the changes are deeper? It's beyond my reach. Did you want to tell me something? I thought you had something to tell me. I will change them for next week. No need to walk me out. Thank you Harris. Thank you Harris for your attention. I love you. Although I can see a lot in someone's writing I didn't pay attention to all the details. I noticed them too late. Small changes weaknesses you avoid signs you deny. You noticed all of this in her writing? Not in her writing. In mine. Talk to me.
