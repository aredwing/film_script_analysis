Mr. Chase, we've been working a deep cover operation in Mexico. It involves drug trafficking... extortion and the murder of Governor Eduardo Quintana in Chihuahua. - Okay, that... What does that have to do with us? - Yeah. Have you ever heard of Don Carlos Cola? It's a dummy corporation that's a front for the Gutierrez drug cartel. They've been laundering money through this corporation for years. This morning they made a $ 106-million deposit to your bank. Daryl, what's going on? Have you ever seen these two men? No. Have you? - No. - That is your house guest from tonight. I gotta assume you're going somewhere with this. Those two guys are on the Gutierrez payroll. In fact, they've been hanging around the neighborhood for the last few days. Wait a minute. That's the guy that was on stage with me. Well, now, this asshole you ought to arrest. Anything you need, I'll testify. Yeah, that's Freddy Tiffany. He's an absolutely crazy man. - Stay away from him. - Wait a minute. - How long have you been following me? - Protecting you, Mr. Chase. There are people out there who want you dead. I'm not gonna let that happen. But for me to help you, you gotta trust me. Daryl. Look, I gotta get back to Mexico for a few days and wind this thing up. Agent Martinez is gonna stay here and provide protection for both of you until we get this case solved. Meanwhile, if anything goes wrong... anything... Mr. Chase, you call me. - Thank you. - Oh, you're welcome. Good luck. Hey, you guys. - Good morning, Julie. What's going on? - Hi, Mr. Chase. Shari's been calling you every few minutes. - I think there's something really wrong. - Yeah, I know. She just paged me. - Is she okay? - She's hysterical. She couldn't even talk. And then these two guys showed up looking for you. - In my office? - Yeah. They're in your office with Mr. Allsworth. - Who are they? - I have no idea. - Oh, shit. - Mr. Chase? - Can I get you more coffee? No? A bagel or... - Excuse me, please, please. Mr. Chase. Mr. Chase? - Step aside! Mr. Chase! - Move! Get out of the way! Get out of the way! Move! Move! Come on! Move! Shari, it's me, Daryl. Shari? Hey! I don't wanna see you naked, but if I have to... Hang up and call again. If you'd like to make a call... Freeze! Oh! Oh, shit. No. - Well, you did it again. - Hey, it happens. - No! No! No! - Come on, guys. How'd the wife... How'd the wife get in here? - Hello? Is that you, Daryl? - Hello? McCready, is that you? Hell, yeah, it's me. I'm in trouble. They think I killed two cops. - Excuse me. Excuse me. - Yeah, sure. Hold on. My secretary, she is dead. Those two guys you showed me the pictures of, they showed up at my office this morning. - Look, I'm in trouble. - Excuse me. - Woman, woman, step off, all right? - But you're not using the phone. I got the phone now. You happy? Look, the shit just hit the fan here. Get your ass up here and get me out of this. Okay. First you gotta get out of New York. What are you talking about? Are you listening to me? I didn't kill anybody. I don't wanna leave New York. Stop it! - You wanna take your chances with NYPD? - Shit. Look, I'm black. I'm not stupid. Okay, get your black ass to Mexico where I can protect you. Meet me in the town of La Questa. La Questa. All right. Listen, Daryl, don't use your credit card, don't show your ID. If you do, they'll find you, they'll kill you. Just get to Mexico. Don't look at anybody. Don't wave at anybody. Don't talk to anybody. Yo, bitch, what up?

Top of the day. How's it going? How you doin' there, sir? I'll be over there in a couple of hours. Don't worry about it. We got it all under control. Hey, hey, smile, man. You look suspicious. That's what I'm talkin' about there too. Hey, hey, hey, hey. Loosen up the walk, too, man. You know what I mean? Put a little pep in the step. That's right. That's right. Take it back to the hood. It's all good in the hood. It's all good. How's it going there, sir? I want you to check the numbers on the ticker tape and I'll get back to you at 7:00. All right? Look, bro, just act black. That's all you gotta do. Say, blood. - What it is, jive turkey. - Hey, hey, hey, bro... All right, mama. What's the last movie you seen, man? Car Wash? Man, you can kiss my ass. Car Wash was a good movie. Final boarding call for the Empire Builder... with service to Newark... Hey, Mr. Chase! In the blue suit! - Mr. Chase! - Hey, hey, hey! What is your problem? Get your hands off of me, mister! - All right, I'm sorry. We made a mistake. - Of course you made a mistake. And I demand an apology from the both of you. What is this all about? A white man in a suit with a black man in a suit... African-American male, 6'1 "to 6'3", wearing a blue suit. - Why you puttin' your hands on me? - Did you say blue suit? Copy that. You'll love it. - How rude. - I'm talking to you! - Whoa! Whoa! Would you just get on the train? - Just get on the train. - Some kind of Feds, huh? - We gotta go. - I know my rights! What do you want? There's not gonna be any Rodney Kings going on. - Hey! Oh, I'm doing good. - Hey, how are you, sir? - You got your ticket? - Yes, yes, yes. How you doin', sisters? This is their first time on a train. I'm trying to tell them how much fun they're gonna have. Oh. There's a first time for everything. You must not do that, young man. Look, we're not trying to give you a hard time, Mr. Allsworth. But imagine how we feel when two of our fellow officers turn up dead. Well, why don't I ask the commissioner about it tomorrow when he comes to my house for cocktails? Yes, he is a friend of mine. And so is Daryl Chase. A very good friend. I brought him into this firm. He is the best and the brightest. I refuse to believe that he has anything to do with this. Okay, good. Now we're all very clear on what you refuse to believe. So why don't I tell you what we do believe? We believe you're full of shit. And we believe Daryl Chase is up to no good. Now, we followed him all the way to Penn Station. - Where do you think he was going? - Vacation, maybe. Vaca... Did he... Did he maybe have a little vacation time stored up, Mr. Allsworth? - What's your point? - My point is that we've notified the authorities everywhere... Mexico, Canada, Oz. Wherever he goes, they're gonna catch him. But just in case there's a slight possibility that he contacts you first, do me one little favor. Pick up the phone, give us a call, okay? - Good day, Mr. Allsworth. - Goodbye, Mr. Allsworth. - You know, I actually believed you were NYPD. - You did a very good job too. You know, most people who wear these are actually missing a tooth. - I just liked the way it looked. - You would. It look good on you, though, bro. It look good. Hi. Just the man I'm looking for. I need two phone lines put in this room if I can. I need an Internet access on one, fax on the other, paper at every stop... New York Times... He needs a fax. He needs a fax. I got all your money. Look at that, girl. Smell it. That's right. Can buy a whole lot of dog food with that. Whole lot of dog... You're a little cutie pie, you know that? - Those things are not included in the price of a ticket. - All I need... is two phone lines in this room: One with Internet access... - You're being rude, just like you were today to those two nuns. - One with a fax. - Making new friends, are we? - Good morning, sir. How are you? Having a nice trip? I'm having an excellent time. Look. Whatever my friend needs here, you put that on my tab. You got it, sir. Whatever you say, you got it. What a gentleman. You gotta love him. You were rude. Racist asshole. Ah, you're gettin' a taste of your own medicine. Now you're startin' to find out it wasn't the brother in the suit... but it was the suit that was on the brother... that got you your so-called respect. Nice watch, ain't it? Yeah, uh, it's... it's real classy. Look, uh, Freddy, I appreciate everything you did helping me get on this train. And I ain't gonna forget it. But when we get to the next stop, we go our own separate ways. - Your services are no longer required. - Oh. Oh, well, ain't that a bitch. It's just like you rich people. When you get done using us downtrodden... hood recipients... you wanna kick us to the curb. Throw us to the wolves like some naked sheep. What the hell do naked sheep got to do with ghetto recipients, Freddy? - What the hell are you talking about? - I give you this much. You know, you probably went to some kind of accredited school, college and whatnot. - Yeah, I went to Harvard. So what? - Well, you know, I went to H.K. U... Hard Knock University. And that's what you gonna need to get out of this. They ain't gonna take no book smarts. Street smarts. - I don't need you, Freddy. - You saying you smarter than me? - I'm saying I'm smarter than you. - You smarter than me? - I'm smarter than you. - Your neurons are firing quicker than mine are. I got your Bulgari ring, your watch... your Italian suit that caresses me, oh, so well... and a phat wad of cash... that you said was two Gs... ah, in what used to be your inner pocket. And I got all of that in less than ten seconds, girl. Did you hear her? Say it again, baby. Ten seconds. But you smarter than me. Come on. Let's burn some ants. We're gonna burn some bugs with these here. What are you doing here? Well, according to the two D cups on your watch, it's dinnertime. You got dinnertime money? I'm just jokin'. I'm just jokin'. - You know, your credit's good with me. - Excuse me, sir. Here's the paper you wanted. That's for him. - Thanks, Guido. - It's Vito. - Whatever. - Thank you, sir. - Anytime now. - Why don't you just bury your head in his ass? - Let's see. One dinner... - You gentlemen ready to order? - Ah, yes, yes. I'm going to have... Let's see here. The prime rib, medium rare. And bring me some Grand Marnier over the rocks. That's the way we used to have it when I was in Harvard. Chauncey made the best ones. I'm gonna have the yard bird burnt to a crisp. Now, I need you to spit on that with a little bit of hot Tabasco. And I'm gonna wash all that down with a 40 dog of Schlitz malt liquor. I'm sorry, sir. I don't believe we have Schlitz malt liquor. No Schlitz malt liquor? No Schlitz malt liquor? Well, ain't that some shit. How you gonna run a successful business... and you ain't got no Schlitz malt liquor? You ain't keepin' it real. You ain't representin'. What you doin' up in here, boy? Uh, uh, uh, shit. - I'll see what I can do, sir. - Ya do that. Fresh-Prince-of-Bel-Air-looking mo... He do look like the father on the Fresh Prince. Hey, uh, look, bro. We ain't gettin' nowhere by fightin'. Why don't you just talk to me? I mean, how bad can it be? It ain't like you murdered anybody. Man, what kind of shit are you into? Freddy, do you remember my assistant, Shari? You met her at the office. The one with that phat ass? Yes. Well, she's dead. I'm sorry, man. My bad. I'm sorry to hear that. L- I went to her apartment and, uh... I don't know what happened, man. These two cops wound up dead, and they think I did everything. What's up with the CIA, bitch? - Ah, here you go, gentlemen. - Uh, thank you. You're a scholar and a gentleman. Compliments to the chef. How do you know about the CIA, Freddy? I, um... I can't really talk to you about this. Is that why we're on our way to Mexico? I happen to know Mexico like the back of my hand. I am internationally known. I done mischief everywhere. Puerto Rico, Colombia, Brazil... all them Mexican countries. - That I believe.- Well, since you're starting to believe me... we been watched for the last three states. - Yeah, I'm sure. - I'm serious as a heart attack.

Just checking in. - Okay. - Um, reservation? - No. - Cash or... cash. - Yeah. Twenty, forty, sixty. Look, I don't mean to be rude, but what is that smell? - That smell is the wave of the future. - This shit smell? - Emu. - Oh, that's what those birds are. - Those are... Those are emu. - 98% fat-free. All your protein and nutrients with the savory flavor of chicken and steak combined... all in one easily farmable bird. Well, I tell ya, that sounds nutritious. Good luck with that. - Can I get a key? - Key. Thank you. Take it easy. Tiffany? Tiffany. Damn, if I were him, I'd have shot the son of a bitch that took that picture. Have you bumped your head? Hey, little darlin'. Our ship has just come in. - Uh, yeah? - Hey, McCready, this is Daryl. - Daryl Chase.- Mr. Chase, where in the hell are you? I'm at an emu ranch in, um... - Shit. Where am I? "Rancito. " - You mean, Texas? Yes, Texas. I was trying to get into Mexico tosee you. I almost got killed at the border. They thought I was Freddy Tiffany. By the way, this guy keeps showing up everywhere. - How the hell does he keep finding me? - I told you to stay away from Tiffany. I'm trying to stay away from Tiffany. I just told you he keeps showing up everywhere I go. Plus, he claims you're at the centre of some drug trafficking scheme. Of course I'm at the centre of it. I'm with the CIA. Right now I'm watching a bunch of drug smugglers load up a plane full of cocaine. They think I'm their friend. That's what I do. I watch the bad guys. Stop listening to a murderer. Listen, your murderer thinks he's with the FBI. - He was kicked out of the Bureau two years ago. - Whoa, whoa, whoa! - He really was with the FBI? - He's out on a 5150. A mental. You are with a class-A psychopath. Mr. Chase, stay put. We're coming to rescue you and take Mr. Tiffany into custody. - Don't move. - I don't believe this. Fine. Hey, McCready. McCready? - Hello? Daryl. - Chloe? - Daryl, Jesus! Where the hell are you? - I don't have time to explain that right now. You all right? - Miss Kent, remember what I said. - No. I got a million cops asking me questions, Daryl. I don't know if you're alive. I don't know if you're dead. I don't know what's happening to our lives. - Okay, partner, we're in business. - You guys wanted lunch? - Whoa, ho, ho. We almost got this. - I got the prefix. Look. Does the word Pentium mean anything to either one of you? Will you get this away from the equipment, please? Take it away from the equipment. - Is Martinez still there with you? - Yeah. - Don't stay on the phone too long. - Chloe, I know all this doesn't make sense to you right now. - But I promise you, it's all gonna be fine. - Stay on the line. - Stay on the line. Don't hang up. - Daryl, I'm scared. - You better hang up the phone. - Quiet, quiet, quiet! Okay, I got the fourth digit. I promise, it's all gonna work out fine. - Stay on the line. Stay on the line. - You better hang up. - Stay on the line. - Baby, I love you. - Five digits! - I love you too. - Hang it up. - Six digits. - Now. - One more thing. Hang up the damn phone! You know, you like a piece of faeces with peanuts... a pain in my ass. - I see you brought your little white girlfriend with you. - Shut up! Probably been on the phone with McCready, huh? Probably told you I was on a 5150. Mm-mmm. It's a 1718. I don't even know what that is. You know what that is? What is it? - A button? - No. It's a transmitter. - What is it? What is it? - A pager. No. This is a tracking device. That's how I knew where you were every time you made a move! Why do you think I had us change clothes at Penn Station... under the auspices of being a criminal, mister? And the dog... Oh, the dog is the centre of this entire investigation. Oh, yeah. You didn't know that, did you? - No. I was under the auspices that it was a tracking device. - Shut up. Get up. You coming with me. Get up! Ooh, ooh, I'm sorry. You may want to hold on to that tracking device. That's all right. I can throw a bullet at you. Don't you go nowhere. You wait right there. Baby, you keep guard, all right? Hey, wait a minute, fool! Come here! Hold on, mister! I threw a ring down the toilet 'Cause that's where our love went All right. Let me guess. Somebody tried to kill you. T.J. McCready miraculously shows up and shoots him. - Yep. That's it. - That's the oldest trick in the book, man. At the Bureau, we call it the double take. If you'd have looked twice, you'd have seen what really happened. - So that didn't really happen? - Nah. It's all smoke and mirrors. See, Thomas Chela is Minty Gutierrez. They're one in the same. The Gutierrez drug cartel ring a bell? He's the guy with the glass eye... floatin' all over his shit, kind of got that Sammy Davis thing happening, man. Hey, wait a minute. You mean Don Carlos Cola is a drug front? Exactly. Governor Quintana was working with the United States Government. I get the drop that somebody's tryin' to assassinate him... get there a couple of minutes late, get caught on camera inside his house. Thus the dilemma I find myself in at this particular junction. - Man, you didn't even do this then. - Hell, no. I didn't murder nobody, unfortunately. Governor Quintana, he was trying to slow the drug flow into the United States. I mean, how good is that for the kids? - That's some serious shit, Freddy. - Yeah. No shit. - You're being framed. - Exactly. By the same people that are trying to frame you. - You FBI. You can go talk to them. They can clear me. They can clear you.- No, no, no, no. This is my point exactly. The FBI has no jurisdiction in Mexico. I'm not even supposed to be playin' right now. This is some rogue shit. - You lookin' at a rogue. - Fred, I had... I had no idea. - You a rogue. - A rogue. - Rogue. - Don't patronize me, man. I'm sorry. My bad. You just a big rogue. I won't p-patronize you, you big rogue. - All right. See you later, rogue. - Man, you might want to listen... to some of this shit if you want to live past tomorrow. - You ain't goin' nowhere without me. - With an IQ of a tree Honey, that ain't all You've seen the last of me Yeah! I'm sorry, man. Really. I'm-I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I've been... I've been rude. - He fits the description. - I'm gonna call it in. Shit on a stick! What the hell? Shit. Get this gun out of my ass! You've got to admit, that "rogue" shit was pretty... Aw, shit! - Your dumb dog bit me! - That's what you get. - Damn! You got sheriff crackers out there thinkin' that you're me. - What? Damn it, Molly Jo! Mike, how'd you get out of the pen? You shit in that pool, and you're gonna end up lunch meat. Shit! It's the Pepsi truck! Shit! Shit! Shit! Mother's Cookies! Mother's damn Cookies! Fiji Water. Damn Fiji Water. Freddy, when McCready gets here, this is all over. Will you calm down? Those are McCready's men out there. Don't you get it? - What are you doin'? - Calling a strike team. Find the right goddam pen, have a strike team here in 30 seconds. Coming soon: The Black Rogue. Joe, Steven, get those trucks out of here. Luther, come with me. "Dear Strike Team. It's me, Freddy. Send help soon. Signed, Rogue. " - Move it out! - You ain't gonna think everything's so damn funny in just about a minute. Gunfire! Hey! Gunfire! Come on, Tiffany! I am not Freddy Tiffany! I am not Freddy Tiffany! I fall to pieces We got a border to cross! - I'm Freddy Tiffany! I'm Freddy Tiffany! - Hell, yes, you are! Get me out of here! I fall to pieces Oh, shit! How can I be just your friend - What the... - You want me to act - Like we've never kissed - Let's go, bitch. You want me to forget Pretend we've never met - You'd better be worth a lot of damn money; that's all I can say. - You mother... And I try and I try but I haven't yet You walk by and I fall to pieces You walk by And I fall to pieces We made it, baby! Hey, man, what's goin' on? Whoa, whoa, whoa! That's my meal ticket, there! I'm sorry about this mess, but I know you know where them big-booty bitches... Get off of me! Don't tell me to shut up! - You don't know who I am. - Put him back in here with Daddy. Now, listen, Mr. Funny Man. Enjoy your visit, huh? Okay. I'm going. Kiss my ass, Paco! Come in, Mr. Tiffany! Come in! Step into my office. Sit down. Have a cigar, Mr. Tiffany. Here. Here. Go on. Go on. Have a cigar. Here. Very good. Go ahead. Go ahead. Huh? You have no idea what it means to meet you, Mr. Tiffany. This is a great moment. I take it you and Governor Quintana weren't exactly friendly. Oh, I loved Governor Quintana! He was a great man who was trying to make a difference. Oh, that is, of course, why he bought the farm, as you Americanos say. But he will always be held in the warmest place of my heart. Let me ask you something, Capitn. What? Wh-What is that? You all smiling at me like I'm Regis and I got a million dollars. - Very funny. - What's up with that? That is because there will be promotions for all of us. You know... the men who captured you. Well, before you boys break out the pinatas and start drinkin' tequila... - I'd like to make my phone call. - Huh? My phone call. To T.J. McCready with the CIA. I think he'll explain who I really am. A phone call? You want to make a phone call? He wants to make a phone call! This is not America, my friend. You do not get a phone call. Next, you will be wanting us to call Johnnie Cochran, huh? Wh-What is this? - I'm not Freddy Tiffany. - What? I'm Daryl Chase. Looks like Foghorn Leghorn over here screwed up. I say... I say, ain't that right, boy? What is the meaning of all of this? Now, hold on. Just wait a second here. Let me think. You realize I can bring you up on charges for trying to trick me? - Now, wait a goddam minute. - Huh? - I am tellin' you, he... - Boss, boss. - What? - Really? Well, we shall see. There is somebody here to see you. - Me? - Mm-hmm. - Who? - Your senorita. Federico. - Wait. I know you, right? - You know me? You know me? Well, I should hope so that you know me. Look, I don't know what's with the accent, but we met at the La Perla party. No, we did not meet at La Perla. We met at the other place. - You know what I'm talking about. - I'm Daryl Chase. - You are not Daryl Chase! You are Federico! - No, no. No, see, I'm Dar... We met at the La Perla party. Remember? - I don't know her. - Well, you... you just said you did. Okay. We met at a party... I met her, but I don't, you know, know her, you know, in the biblical, like she... You know me! You know me mucho times, okay? - Mucho times. - I don't know this girl. - Why? Why are you doing this to her? - Look. I don't know... what greasy, grubby nigga she been laying up in the bed with. - I ain't got nothin' to do with this. - That is not a very nice thing to say. I'm not lyin'! I do not know her! Captain... I never talked to this "macarena" girl! I love you, Freddy! This a bad time to talk about that reward? Don't worry about a thing, girl. 'Cause when we get to Mexico, I'm a Mexican and you a chihuahua. So you gotta learn how to habla Espanol when we get there, you know. Hey, girl. Look at this: An invasion of Texas. Hey, y'all have a good time in America! And my name is Paco if anybody asks. Bark in Spanish. Well, that was good, girl. Sure you ain't got no chihuahua in you? I mean, how hard can this be? On our way to Mexico. Oh, hell, yeah. We cruisin', baby. Look at that. Yeah, this is good. Oh, shh... Shit! Delores! Delores! I see you, baby! Here I come! Hang in there, girl. Ah. Ah, I told you Daddy'd be here. Ai-yai-yai. It's my baby. Thank you. Thank you. - 'Preciate it. 'Preciate it. - No, no, no, no. No, no, no. Black man going to Mexico. Y'all can go to Compton. I'm going to Mexico! Look. Over that way! No! U.S.A. Me and the dog can take all y'all. Bring it on! Bring it on! Watch it, baby. Bite 'em! Keep missin' with me. All of ya. No. Look out. - Here you go, Mr. Allsworth. - Hmm? Thank you. - Mm-hmm. - This is a good thing you're doing, Chloe. The CIA won't let anything happen to him. You're doin' the right thing by helpin' us out. I'll do whatever it takes. I ain't gettin' out! Yeah, drop me off right here! Thanks for the ride, suckers! Shit. Hello, Mr. Chase. I trust you had a pleasant trip. - You have no idea. - I've come to get you out of here. Let's go. Thanks, man. Shit. Daryl, wait up. I need to step over here and take care of some paperwork... and get your things, and then you can tell me about everything. The sooner I get out of here, the better. - What happened to your leg? - A dog bit me. Oh. Here you go, amigo. Freddy Tiffany. Let me guess. Somebody tried to kill you. T.J. McCready miraculously shows up in the nick of time... and shoots him. Shit. And the dog? Oh, the dog is the centre of this entire investigation. Shit. Shit. Shit. Hey, Martinez. Daryl, you want to step over here and sign out? Daryl? - Where is he? Where did he go? - Who? Chase. He made me. He's on the move. - We didn't see him. - He's on foot. He's running. Let's go. What in the shit were y'all doin'? Let's move it. We gotta find him. We gotta find him. We gotta find him. Oh! Sorry. Don't move! Now, you heard me. Don't move. - Freddy? - Yeah, it's me. Hey, hey, hey. It's gonna be all right. All right? I'll get you through this. - I thought you was crazy. - Hey, hey, hey, hey. Hey, look. - We gotta get the hell out of here. - No, no. I gotta get to New York. McCready's dirty like you said. Martinez left Chloe. - I don't know if she's dead. - Look, look, look. She's gonna be fine. Chloe's going to be fine. Remember my partners Norville and Gradney? Partners? Wait, wait, wait. The drug dealers? They're FBI agents. They've been down with me the whole time. It's a covert operation. Let's get the hell out of here before we end up with bullets in our head. Oh, shit! Down, bitch! - Do I look like I'm goddam moving? - I'm talking to the goddam dog! - Who is that? - Oh, you're gonna like this. Oh, yeah? What am I gonna like about this? The new guy, bought and paid for. Send him up, Minty. Send him up. I can't begin to tell you how you guys have screwed things up for me. You are a bunch of stupid, incompetent jackasses... who don't know how to do a simple job. And you... If you are any indication of the efficiency... of the Central Intelligence Agency, let me tell you, my friend: Your government is in deep water. Minty, in every operation there are a couple of snags. You go off like a loose cannon, kill Governor Quintana... get bit by his dog and have the stupidity to leave it behind... connecting you to the crimes and me as well. And you call that "snags"? And you... You assured me that my money was safe... safe from prying eyes. Well, Minty, it was, until you transferred $ 106 million... into your account in a single day. Daryl would've had to be dead not to catch it. See, Minty? A snag. Minty, I will handle your accounts personally if things get any worse. And exactly how much worse are they supposed to get? - I can handle Daryl. - That time is all passed now. I am going to take care of Daryl myself, my way. Oh, hey, I don't like the sound of that. - That is music to my ears. - Gentlemen. - Hi, baby. - Come here. - What happened to you? - Stinkin' mutt bit me. Damn thing's bitin' everybody, right? Yeah. That little furball has got sharp teeth. Minty, I'd like for you to meet Agent Gradney, FBI. Let me guess, huh? You... You want a piece of the action, hmm? - I'm worth it. - Yeah? Show me how you're worth it. Well, why don't we ask Maque here. - Isn't that right, sweet thing? - Hey. Wh-Wh-What do you think that you're doing, huh? She's Tiffany's partner. Always has been. She was a plant from the beginning. Now, that bite mark's the only thing that connects you to this murder. We make sweet thing disappear here, along with that stinkin' mutt... FBI doesn't have much of a case, now, do they? Whoa. You are better than I thought. Damn! Elliot was a good man... and there wasn't too many good men at the Bureau. They put me on a 5150 because I give a damn. I'm sorry about your friend, man. There's somebody special in there I want to get out. It's payback time. - No wonder the Bureau kicked him out. - Hey, hey, hey. Watch it. Slow! I am Freddy Tiffany, FBI! - Oh, look at that fool. - Lookie here. Lookie here. Keep your hands off me! You know damn well you got orders not to shoot. You know what's goin' down? I'm going to arrest all you crackers. - You can believe that and then some. - Hey, Tiffany. - What? - I think you forgot about me. - No, I didn't. - Freeze! Freeze. You, I'm just going to kill. Martinez, drop your gun. Drop it. - You all right, baby? - I'm better now. Get your ass over there. You, Jones! Get your bitch ass over there! - Daryl, handle your business. - Here, sweetie. Thank you, baby. You know how I like silver guns. T.J., where is Chloe? Banker boy, how do you plan on gettin' out of here? Your life is worth less than a Mexican food stamp right now. I'm going to ask you again. Where is Chloe? Eh, Mr. Chase, Chloe is in perfect health. If you don't believe me, take a look out that window. See for yourself. - Please. - Thomas... if I don't like what I see, you're all dead men. - Daryl, this is not like you. - I think the brother means business. Put your hands where I can see 'em! - Hey, baby! - Well, what did you expect, huh? Your girlfriend in chains and shackled in a deep, dark wine cellar, huh? We are all civilized here, Mr. Chase. - What about Governor Quintana? - Unfortunately... Quintana didn't want to be part of our happy little family. That's why I'm sure you both will be more cooperative than he was. More cooperative? C.A., you piece of shit. You were like a father to me. Well, you're still like a son to me, Daryl. That's why all of this can be resolved very simply and cleanly. - C.A., shut up. - Hey, uh, Minty. I got a question. How is it you can afford the CIA, a banker from Wall Street... but you can't seem to buy a better eye... than that marble you got rollin' around in your skull? - Oh, you got some balls, Tiffany. - That's what your mama said. Okay, Minty. Enough of this cops-and-robbers bullshit. - Call in the guns. - I'm afraid I can't do that. - I beg your pardon? - I have always known... that Maque Sanchez was with the FBI. God, Charles, I have got well over $600 million... in your American banks right now, which your government has frozen. The only chance I have of ever recovering any of my money... is to turn all of you over to the Justice Department... which Mr. Tiffany and Miss Sanchez happen to be members of. My God. You set me up. That's why you made that goddam deposit. - You started all of this. - Ah, that's right. And you clowns just confessed to everything we need. Considering the caliber of your work... you are all lucky to be able to walk out of here with your lives. Betrayal. Ain't it a bitch? - Drop the gun, or I'll kill her. - Put it down. - I swear I'll kill her. - Drop the gun, Tiffany. - Put the gun down now. - Tiffany, you son of a bitch, I'll kill her! - Put it down! - Will you stop it, Freddy? - Drop the gun. - Put it down! - Shut up! - Put it down now! - Goddam it, Freddy! - Put your gun down! - I'll kill her! - You want to go there with me? - Relax! - I'll kill her! - Let's go there! - Freddy! - Me and you! - Shut up! - Shoot him! - Huh? What? - Shut up! - Freddy! - I'll roll you like a Philly blunt and smoke your bitch ass! They shot Minty! Cover me, baby. Cover me! Clear! Come on! - Martinez? - What? - You play golf, right? - What? I know your families used to run around with leaf blowers cuttin' lawns. - But you play golf, right? - No, man. Why don't you come out here and show me? Well, here's a little lesson from Tiger. Fore! Yeah, he's dead. Just about out of here. You really are from the projects. You didn't hit a damn thing. Now, let me show you how a shooter never, ever misses. Oh, no! Oh! Oh! He wasn't lying. He didn't miss once. Looks like it's the last one. They're going to hang a sign over your cell: "Over one billion served. " - You never know, do you? - Hello, Daryl. Chloe. Shari? Sorry, Daryl. We had to get you out of New York. It was our only way to flush out T.J. McCready... and connect him with Charles Allsworth and Gutierrez. - So they're... they're with... - They're all with me. Just one big, happy FBI family. I trusted you, and you... you used me. We did what we had to to save your life. Daryl, baby, it's over, all right? And we're safe. - Can I hug an FBI agent? - No. But you can hug a friend. That'll work. - Thank you. - You're welcome. - Take care of yourself. - No doubt. You still got a phat ass. Freddy, I can't believe you're from Malibu. Malibu High. Class of'84. - Oh, he's so cute. - Thank you. Then I went to Hawaii. I was on the pro surf circuit for about three years. Hey, hey, hey. Your brother came in first. Brother from Malibu. Chloe, look at this. - Oh, what's so funny? - Nothin'. - I know you're not laughin' at my man. - Have you seen this? Yes, I have. I think he looks cute. Thank you. Okay, baby. Okay. It's all right. Hey, uh... uh, Daryl, you didn't touch that, did you? Oh, this? Yeah, I know. It can scramble a strike team in less than 30 seconds. I don't want nobody else but you Oh, see? See what I'm talkin' about? I don't want nobody else but you Go in! Go in! Go in! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!
