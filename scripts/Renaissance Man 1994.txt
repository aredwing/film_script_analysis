Leroy, tell him he cant do that. -Shut up, asshole. -Naw, man, hes dissin you. Why you startin with me, inbred Jed? Sit over there and shut up. Montgomery, you finished? Is that the end of the intelligent repartee? All right. Why dont we begin with Haywood? How come I got to go first? Because youre from Wallahoochee, Georgia. -[ Montgomery ] Get up there, boy. -Willacoochee, Bill. Willacoochee. Theres these woods behind our trailer park. This old guy lives in the woods there... and everybody in town swore he was crazy. -""He showed me how to hunt... -[ Yawning ] how to be real quiet and how to listen. He said he had seen everything in the world there was to see. And thats why he never wanted to leave those woods. Me and my daddy got laid off at the paper mill. ""Whilst I spent about five months watchin TV with my brothers... I kept thinkin of what the old man said. Finally, I decided that I did want to see more of the world... than what was behind that trailer park, so I joined up. I liked living with my Aunt Mavis in Chicago the best. But last summer, my mother Ruthie came back, and we drove to Atlanta. She said we dont have to stay long, but then she met a man and take off. ""I waited around for a while for her to come back... but everybody keeps sayin just go on home. I dont know where that is. ""So I take the bus to Cleveland and spend two days staring at the poster behind the driver... that said, Be All You Can Be. ""So I think about that for a week... and then I think... I gotta be somewhere, so here I am. [ Montgomery ] ""In my crib... there aint never been a time when we eat, or sleep, or nothin. You know, everybody just runs around crazy. Half the time I dont even know who they are. [ Scoffs ] I must be the only person in the world to join the army... so hed know exactly what time he was eatin lunch. I wanted to learn a new trade. -Sergeant Cass. -Afternoon, sir. -[ Bill ] Brian Davis, Junior. -Sir, yes, sir. [ Clears Throat ] Why I joined the army... I wanted to be in the army for as long as I can remember. ""I never really knew my dad cause he died in Vietnam when I was a baby. His name was Brian too. My whole life my mama showed me pictures of him... and read me his letters and told me how he was a hero. -Bullshit, man. He wasnt no hero. -He was so! -How you gonna prove that? You got no proof. -Hey, hey, hey. -[ Davis ] I dont need proof. -Get it through your thick skull. Your daddy was no hero. -[ Myers ] Shut up.! -Read my lips. Hes selling you a dream. -Would you knock it off and let him finish? -[ Davis ] My mom told me.! -[ Benitez ] Your mommy made it up. -[ Haywood ] Cut it out.! Go ahead. She told me about how he was a hero. He died for his country. I think that if my daddy was alive today... hed want me to be in the army too... [ Crying ] so I could learn to be brave. Im sorry. Thats okay. Its all right. Take it easy. [ Clears Throat ] So, um-- I guess the real reason I, I joined the army... was to get a better education so I could get a better job. And thats why. " When I was a kid, I used to love summers cause there was no school. [ Montgomery Laughs ] "I had to baby-sit my kid sister, but I didnt mind too much. I mean, wed fight a lot but, you know, mostly we just used to kid around. She wanted to be a dancer. She was pretty good too. One day a couple of summers ago, I sent her up to the store to buy some milk. Now, the bullet was meant for the dude comin out of the store... ""I still miss her a lot, but I always miss her more in the summer. After that I decided that being part of a gang didnt seem like such a good idea. So I joined this gang. That good enough, Mr. Rago? Yeah. -[ Man ] How you doin, sir? -Lets have a coin check. [ Bill ] Can I have a Dewars, please, with seven aspirin back? -Seven aspirin? You okay? -Catch you later. Yeah. Oh, Jesus. I mean, some of the stories these kids have. I cant--I cant believe it. Its really somethin, huh? Everybodys got a story. You wanna hear my story, Bill? [ People Chattering ] Not now, Tom. Some other time. Well, you know what I think? Whats that, Tom? You see, after their families let em down, they go to whats left of their schools. The teachers are underpaid. Theyre scared, so they stop teaching. But that doesnt stop em from handing out high school diplomas like they were toilet paper. So that means we gotta take em. Country better shape up soon, though. Were going to hell in a handcart. But thats strictly between you and me, right? Yeah. [ Knocking Bar] Could I have my aspirin, please? [ Drill Sergeant ] Swing up and stand on--No.! -Stand on the log! You ready to quit? You ready to quit? -No! -No, Drill Sergeant! -Get the hell back up there! This is not that complicated. Forty-one, Drill Sergeant. No, Private, its not 41 . Youre reading the wrong numbers. Read the red numbers. -One, two, three-- -[ Groans ] -Youve got to be kiddin me. -No, Drill Sergeant. Three weeks, motor mouth. Three weeks, you have yet to show me a real push-up. -I expect to get this one pretty good. -Theyve all got to be good! Two fingers. Thats what its supposed to be, two fingers. -Understand that, Private Myers? -Yes, Drill Sergeant. [ Drill Sergeant ] Keep movin, Benitez. All the way to the end. Dont stop.! Come on, get back to the line! Go back to the start of the line! Hurry up! Youre gonna make it, Benitez. All right, times up. Who wants to talk about what they read? -Benitez, come on up here. -All right. [ Chuckles ] -What are you readin? Okay. -Archie comic. I mean, whats up with Jughead? Archies got Betty. And you got Reggie with Veronica. I mean, whats up with Jughead? In my neighborhood, it didnt matter how ugly you were, you always had a girl. I dont know whats the matter with this guy. Another thing, you guys maybe could help me. -Mr. Rago, hold on a sec. Uh, here it is. -[ Groans ] Come on, Archie, lets go to the malt shoppe. What the hells a malt shop-ee? -[ Montgomery ] Benitez. -Whats a malt shop-ee? You guys know? Bring your stupid ass over here. -Whats the matter with you? -What do you mean? -What are you doin readin a comic book? -He said bring anything. -I bought a comic book. I like comic books. -Knock it off. -Youre here for education, not to read comic books. -Youre embarrassing me, boy. -Thats stupid. -You could a got something else at the P.X. -Yeah, like Batman or Superman or Spider-Man. -Come on, shut up! -[ Benitez ] They scare me. -[ Sighs ] -[ Montgomery Laughs ] -Bunch of hyenas. -Whats the book you got, Mr. Rago? -This? -Yeah. -This is called Hamlet. Hamlet. Yo, thats about a little-bitty pig, right? No, it aint about a little-bitty pig! Whats it about, Billy boy? Its about... sex... murder, incest... -insanity. -Ohhh. -Shoot. Beats the hell out of this garbage Im readin. -Guns. Sure does. Pretty much beats the heck out of any book ever written. -All right, Leroy. -Yeah? -What are you readin? -Uh, Sports Illustrated. The Faces in the Crowd section. Why dont you tell us more about your book? Sounds more interesting. Yeah, who wrote it? Well, it was written by William Shakespeare. You ever hear of Shakespeare? -I heard of him. That guys in Central Park every summer. -Dude mustve got mugged a lot. Hes been dead for almost 400 years. -See that? They killed him. They killed him. New Yorkers. -Yeah, yeah. He wrote plays. Plays. You know, like TV. Without the box. Mmm. They didnt have any TVs back then or movies. Or that many books even. So everybody went to the theater. Everybody. Kings, queens, right down to the working stiffs. -Why dont you read us some of that? -Word. Skip to the page with some incest so we can make Haywood feel at home. Sooey! No, you guys dont want to hear about Hamlet. What? What? What? I guess were not smart enough. -No, no, no, no. Its just very, I dont know, its-- -[ Montgomery ] Here we go. -What? Its just what? -Its complicated. So? Were here. Were listenin. [ Clears Throat ] Sit down. Okay, okay. All right, heres the deal. Um-- Hamlet is, uh... uh, hes a prince. All right. And, uh... -and hes away at college. -[ Montgomery ] Rich kid. Right? And he, he gets word that his father died. -Oh, no, Davis, please, dont start cryin. -Leave me alone, Benitez! -Forget about it. -Benitez, shut up, all right? -Chill. -Go ahead. All right, so he comes home from college for the funeral. And when he gets back, everythings fishy. All right? You ever hear of the term, something is rotten in the state of Denmark? Naw, but in apartment 3-C, my building, Miss Leary... every Thursday, she always cooks the corned beef and cabbage. -Mm-hmm. -Something sure smells rotten in the state of New York. All right. Thats the same kind of thing. -That was dumb. That was really dumb. -Leave him alone, man. He gets back, and hes in mourning... and less than a month goes by and his mother gets remarried. -Damn. -To his uncle. -[ Everybody Gasps ] -Thats the incest part. Okay? So, now, Hamlet spends the rest of the play trying to decide... whether hes got the guts to go after his uncle the king... and avenge his fathers death, or if he wants to just... go with the flow and do what his mother is tellin him to do. -Naw. -Dont go out like that. So, where I am in the play, [ Clears Throat ] Hes with his mother and the king and shes trying to cheer him up. And she says... Good Hamlet, cast thy nighted color off... and let thine eye look like a friend on Denmark. Do not forever with thy veiled lids seek for thy noble father... -in the dust. -[ Montgomery ] What? -Hey, you wanna lay that down one more time? -Please. Well, its--its really easy. You just gotta listen, all right? Cast thy nighted color off. Well, what color do we wear at a funeral? -Black. -Black! -A nighted color. -Shes tellin him not to wear black, to stop mourning. -[ Bill ] Right? -[ Hobbs ] Right. It says, Let thine eye look like a friend on Denmark. Which means shes sayin dont glare at me as though you hate me. Why should he? His fathers bodys not cold yet and shes given the punnani to UncleJoe. Something like that. Only its Uncle Claudius. -What the hell is a punnani? -[ Montgomery ] Cave boy never heard of punnani. Hey, Mr. Bill, when my daddy split on my mama, he moved in... with her sister, who is, of course, my auntie. And I got a baby cousin whos also my baby sister. Thats sort of the same thing. Mel speaks. [ Chuckles ] [ Applause, Whistling ] -Glad to have you, Mel. -I got a question. -Yes? -Now, if look like a friend means dont hate me... why dont she say dont hate me? -Because its poetry. -But it dont even rhyme, yo? Yeah, but its like, you know, uh-- Its language. Its trying to put things together that evoke... a certain-- It sounds better. What do you mean? I mean, it doesnt sound like anything to me. I dont get it. Yeah. Come on, Teach, teach us. Its--all right. Its a simile. -A what? -A simile. All right, here. -[ Benitez ] A simile. -Yeah. [ Montgomery ] Thats a little yellow face with a smile on it. Um-- -[ Melvin ] Si-mi-le. -Simile. Its, uh... when you take two things... that, um... dont seem alike... but in a way, they are. -Huh? -[ Leroy ] Hmm? All right. All right, were lookin for a simile. Haywood. Um...youre, uh-- Youre workin in the mill and, uh... you come home or youre on your way home. You go to a bar, you stop for a brew. Down at the end of the bar is a beautiful woman. And she winks at you. All right? You go to her like--fill in the blank. -[ Mumbling ] I dont know. -Like a rooster with an itch! [ Class Chuckles ] Like a rooster with an itch. Way to go, Davis. You gotta love those barnyard similes. All right, that was simile. Now, heres somethin else. A metaphor. -All men are-- -Dogs. Dogs! Okay, you got it? Simile: like dogs. Well, heres metaphor. We just plain are... dogs. Okay? All right. Now, this is a good one here. -All right, lets see. -[ Writing On Chalkboard ] -Oxymoron. -[ Montgomery ] Hold up. Hold up, hold up. You cant do that. That is a diss. I aint no oxmoron. No, no, no, no. Not oxmoron, schmuck. Oxymoron. Its when you take two words that are totally the opposite and you jam em together. All right? Like, uh... military intelligence. Dark victory. Thunderous silence. Hmm? Girly-man. -[ Class Chuckling ] -He talkin about you, Benitez. -[ Benitez ] Youre killin me. -Okay. So, lets end the class with, uh... an oxymoron from Shakespeare himself, Parting is such sweet sorrow. If you say so. -Take it easy, Billy boy. Two times. -[ Leroy ] Fall in outside. -Thanks, Mr. Bill. See you tomorrow. -Hoo-ah. Thanks, Mr. Rago. That was neat. -Take care, Bill. -Take it easy, Rocko. Im teachin Shakespeare. [ Chuckles ] That is, uh, Parting is such sweet sorrow. All right. Readin Hamlet to the double-Ds. Come on! -Ive been waitin for this! -[ Troops Shouting ] -Beat him down! Lets go! -Kick his ass! Come on! [ Grunts ] [ Helicopter Passing Overhead ] -Hey! Hey! -Huh? You must be Bill. -Yeah, thats me. -Yeah. -You dont seem to mind them calling you that. Okay if I do the same, Bill? -No problem. Bill, Id appreciate it if youd employ a bit more discipline in your classroom. Would that be too much to ask? I mean, this isnt Harvard yard. This is a military-- -Whoa, whoa, Lou, take it easy. -Who the fuck is Lou? Whats your problem? Im just walkin here. You got a bug up your ass? You know what I think, Bill? I think your whole class thing is a bunch of bullshit. -I think youre wastin my time. -Your time? -Thats right. -Its their class. I dont see you in the class, so lighten up. Their time is my time, Bill. Now, I have exactly 54 days to teach these young kids... what it takes to save lives in combat, in combat, Bill! Now, I dont think theyre gonna learn that... writing a bunch of touchy-feely little papers for the English teacher. No. Theyre gonna learn that out here with me! Im gonna be certain of that. Now, thats my mission, Bill. And I can handle it cause its my job. Yeah, well, you do your job and Ill do mine. You know what the difference here, Bill, is? I care about what I do. [ Troops Continue Shouting ] Do him, Haywood. -[ Class Chattering ] -Lady and gentlemen, its show time! [ Montgomery ] Oh, show time at the Apollo. -Whats this? -This is Hamlet. I figured that since we have to do something, we might as well do something that I love... and that you showed a little bit of interest in, so... here. -Put your desks in a circle facing each other. -[ Chattering ] You mean you want us to read this stuff? Yeah, Benitez, even you could do it. -Plus, it cost me nine bucks to run those things off. -Billy boy, it says here... ""Show me the steep and thorny way to heaven... uh, whiles--Willis, like... the puffed and reckless libertinay. -Libertine! -Libertine. Hey, yo. -You gonna come translate this for us? -Why? Its in English. -Uh-uh. -Now... Roosevelt Hobbs... -you be Hamlet. -All right. Benitez, youre gonna be Hamlets best friend, Horatio. -Thats cool, bro. -Okay, Miranda Myers, you will be... -Hamlets girlfriend, the fair Ophelia. -She aint exactly fair. -Quiet. Melvin! -[ Hobbs ] Mighty fair to me. Melvin! Mel. Melvin, when you wake up, you will be Polonius, Ophelias father. -Leroy. Youll be Ophelias brother, Laertes. -Right. -Montgomery, youre the ghost. -The who? -The ghost. -[ Haywood Chuckles ] You the ghost in the hood. [ Mimicking Haywood ] You the ghost in the hood. Goo-ooh. -[ Blabbering ] -[ Sighs ] Haywood... -youre the king. -Thank you, Bill. -Damn, I should have been the king. -Davis. You will be Queen Gertrude, Hamlets mother. -[ Class Laughing ] -Sir, isnt that a womans part? -Alas, Private Davis, we have but one woman in our class. -One. But, sir, Id really prefer another part. Relax, Davis. Youll be reassured to know... that in Shakespeares day, all the parts were played by men. -What? -Yeah. Thats right. -Romeo and Juliet were a couple of guys? -Correctamundo. Bill, you know as well as I do a guy playing a girl is plain filthy! Especially if its gonna be my wife. -Thats your woman. -[ Haywood ] Shut up, Leroy.! Oh, they say Jove laughs. Oh, gentle Romeo. ""If thou dost love, pronounce it faithfully. Or if thou thinkest I am too quickly won, Ill frown. And be perverse. And say thee nay. So thou wilt woo. In truth, fair Montague, I am too fond, and therefore... thou mayst think my behavior light. But trust me, gentle man. Ill prove more true than those that have more cunning to be strange. Hmm. I should have been more strange. I should have been more strange, I must confess. But that thou overheardst, ere I was ware, my true love passion. Therefore, pardon me, and not impute this yielding to light love. Which the dark night hath so discovered. You know, that shade of blue really brings out your eyes. -[ Laughing ] See? -[ Class Laughing ] -Hoo-ah. -No problem. All right. [ Troops Yelling ] Lets go, ladies. Come on. -Thats it, Baby Huey. Come on.! -Move it! Do not saw the air too much with your aim thus. [ Troops Yelling ] [ Shouting ] No, no, no, no. Gimme that. -You step in and then step in with the right foot. -All right, Drill Sergeant. So, what Hamlets father, the ghost, is tellin him... that because he was killed... poisoned in his sleep in the afternoon... with his sins still on his soul... that he cant get a pass straight to heaven. All right, soldiers. Close your eyes and break the seal of the mask. -Do it! -Keep your mouth closed... -and do not inhale the gas under any circumstances. -Drill Sergeant. Too easy, Drill Sergeant! [ Coughs, Gagging ] [ Grunting ] All right, good, Melvin. See how good it is when you stay awake? Hamlets confronted his mother, and she knows deep down in her soul... shes gonna have these stains forever on her soul. Thats deep, man. Stains on her soul. -Way deep. Right? -Mm-hmm. [ Troops Shouting ] Queen Gertrude. [ Drill Sergeant ] Yeah. Yeah. Too easy, Hobbs, eh? Neither... a borrower... nor a lender bef---before--" No. For loan oft... "Ioses both... itself and friend. "And borrowing... "dulls the edge of husbandry. This above all, to... thine own self be true. Melvin. All right, Melvin. Stop. You can say the rest when you come out of the coma. Sit down.

College scouts mustve been tossin hookers through your bedroom window. Yeah, yeah. Just about. I busted my knee my senior year. I mean, I can push on it a little bit now, but-- Well, lets just say it blew my shot. Oh. Isnt there somethin else you can do? No, theres nothin else for me to do. I was black and I played ball. Thats all anybody ever cared about. They didnt teach me anything, but, oh, they kept passin me. - Mmm. - So Im here, you know? My wife works on the post here cause we got a baby comin. Leroy, Jr.? Great! Kidll probably come out wearin a helmet, get the Heisman. Im keepin that kid as far away from the playin field as I can. Runnin a football never helped nobody pass a civil service exam. Least ways, it never helped me. Excuse me. Hey, Leroy. Ya ever hear of a guy named Leonbattista Alberti? Yeah, yeah. He played for the 49ers, right? Nah. He played for the 1 400s. The renaissance. - The what? - Hes what youd call a renaissance man. The guy was an architect, a writer, a painter, a musician... a scholar-- god knows what else. But you know what I remember most about him? They say that he could stand with his feet together like this... and spring straight over a mans head. - Re-- Really? - Yeah. If Leonbattista Alberti couldnt have done that... I wouldnt have remembered a thing about him. So he was sort of like a smart jock, then, right? Thats right. You got it. Now, aint that an oxymoron? - That is. That is. - Uh-huh. Uh-huh. - [ Laughing ] - Give me some. All right. - Talk to you later, Mr. Rago. - All right. The real question is, is Ophelia right? Is Hamlet crazy? Hobbs. I dont know. I think hes just playin the fool. Go on. Well, its like he says. Denmarks a prison. Everybodys watchin him all the time, spyin on him.

Lend thee eye a terrible aspect. Let it pry through the portage of the head like the brass cannon. Let the brow overwhelm it as fearfully as doth a galled rock. Now set the teeth... and stretch the nostril wide. Hold hard the breath and bend up every spirit to his full height. On... on you noblest English... whose blood is fet from fathers of war-proof. Fathers that like so many Alexanders have in these parts... from morn til even fought... and sheathed their swords for lack of argument. Dishonor not your mothers. Now attest that those whom you called fathers did beget you. Be copy now to men of grosser blood and teach them how to war. And you, good yeomen... whose limbs were made in England... show us here the mettle of your pasture. Let us swear that you are worth your breeding... which I doubt not. For there is none of you so mean and base... that hath not noble luster in your eyes. I see you stand like greyhounds in the slips... straining upon the start. - [ War Drums Beating ] - The games afoot.! Follow your spirit... and upon this charge cry... - God for Harry. - Harry! - England! - England! And Saint George!

Everything was great. I just didnt like them stupid accents they used. Thats so stupid. Why cant they talk like us, right? - Listen to yourself. - Listen to you! - [ Haywood ] Rocky Balboa or somebody. - [ Laughing ] [ Haywood ] Talk about an accent. [ Benitez ] Henry Vsays... [ Imitating Al Pacino ] Once more into the breach, dear friends, once more. Or close the wall up with our English dead. - In peace, there is nothing so becomes a man--" - As shuttin the hell up.

But I just told her I was C.I.P. C.I.T.? C.I.G.? - D. - D. Im C.I.D. So, can I get the records? - No. - Aw, come on. Is that all you ever say? No. Hmm. A window of opportunity. [ Softly ] Huh? No?

Im not good at tests. - [ Recruits Chattering ] - Look. You are not dumb. But I need you to know that. that nobody gave you anything. I want you to know what it feels like to make the grade... all on your own. You can do it. I know it.

Im giving em a test this Friday. - Oh, no, youre not. - Oh, yes, I am. Look, you dont kid around with tests in the army. - Tests are real things here. - Thats right, including mine. Look, youve done your job. The Drill Sergeants are happy with your guys. Theyre makin it as soldiers. They dont need your test. Youre wrong, Tom. If they pass it, theyll know they earned something. And if they flunk it, theyre gone. This isnt Princeton. We dont have summer school. You got it? - [ Exhales ] - Sit down, please, Bill. Look, I know you mean well... but this time listen to me. Theyre almost there. Dont do to them what you did to Hobbs. This came for you. [ Hobbs ] Dear Mr. Rago... thanks for all your letters. I dont know what you and Captain Murdoch wrote to the warden... but it sure worked cause I may be gettin outta here soon. Just wanted you to know I been reading Othello. Imagine that:: Mr. Shakespeare writin about a black man way back then... and a soldier too. Prison librarian says Im the first to check out Shakespeare in 1 6 years. She asked me if I was interested in signin up for some college classes. I told her if they had a few teachers like you... I just might. Well, Mr. Rago, like Hamlet says... ""The rest is silence. " Sincerely... Nathanial T. Hobbs. Hey, Mr. Rago, lets talk about the fight... Yo, Billy, my boy, lets get back to the graveyard... cause them clowns diggin up them skulls-- thats the mad stuff. - Yo, whats up with that? - All right. Okay. Mr. Rago, does Hamlet have a last name or what? [ Montgomery ] I know you know. You the man. Yup. Yup. Were gonna go over everything... but, uh... but first I have to talk to you about something. Um, according to the army... [ Exhales ] youre not required to take a test... to pass this class. Hallelujah! Hey, yo! We passed! I give you an A+, Mel. Thank you. Well, you get an A+ too. Now, hold on, Mr. Bill. What are you sayin here... that if we fail, we still pass? No. If you take a test, and you fail... youre out. Youre out of the army. Is that clear? - What? - Um, you said if we take the test. Yeah, Davis. The choice is yours. Hold on. Hold on, Billy. How bout if we take the test, pass the test? We get a bonus? We get, like, keys to a car, cash, a prize maybe? A little somethin? Some incentive? You get a prize. Yeah. But you cant drive it... or spend it... or even see it. All you can do is feel it. What the hell kind of prize is that? I got a family, all right? I need this job. Imagine goin home, tellin your ma you got a Shakespearean discharge. - Bill. - Hmm? If you get any sadder, youre gonna trip over your lip. Im sorry. Uh, Im just not a fun date tonight. Aw, just lighten up a little bit. - People are gonna think I kidnapped you. - [ Laughs ] You know, we get to keep these. - Ah. - I have a lovely set of 1 6 at home.

Just because its rainin, the battle doesnt stop! Remember that! - [ Cass ] Go.! - [ Recruits Grunting ] [ Grunting ] My old drill sergeant used to say-- go! [ Shouting, Grunting ] ""If it aint rainin, we aint trainin.!" Oh, give me the rain! Give me the rain! Yes, indeed. Go.! Private Melvin, front and center on the double! Go.! [ Recruits Shouting, Grunting ] Private Melvin, you study Shakespeare. Yes, sir, Drill Sergeant! Go! Let me hear it, then. I study Shakespeare, Drill Sergeant! No.! No.! I wanna hear some.! Recite it. Go! Fall back in. Private Benitez! Front and center.! [ Grunts ] Private Benitez, New York. - You study Shakespeare? - Drill Sergeant, yes, Drill Sergeant! All right. Let me hear some. Go! I said I wanna hear some. Lets go! [ Shouting Continues ] He that lives-- Come on, what? What was that? I cant hear it! Come on.! Go.! [ Grunting, Shouting Continue ] He that outlives this day... and comes safe home... will stand a-tiptoe when this day is named... and rouse him at the name of Crispian. I didnt tell ya to stop. Keep goin! Keep goin! Go.! He that shall live this day and see old age... will yearly on the vigil feast his neighbors and say... tomorrow is Saint Crispian. Then will he strip his sleeves, show his scars... and say, These wounds I had on Saint Crispians day. Old men forget, yet all shall be forgot. But hell remember with advantages... what feats he did that day. Then shall our names... familiar in his mouth as household words... Harry the King, Bedford and Exeter... Warwick and Talbot... Salisbury and Gloucester... be in their flowing cups freshly remembered. And this story shall the good man teach his son. And Crispin Crispian shall neer go by... from this day to the ending of the world... but we in it shall be remembered. [ Thunder Rumbling ] We few... we happy few... we band of brothers. For he today that sheds his blood with me... shall be my brother. And gentlemen in England now abed... shall think themselves accursed they were not here... and hold their manhoods cheap whiles any speaks... who fought with us... upon Saint Crispians day. That enough, Drill Sergeant? Yes, Benitez. Good. - That was nice! - Good job! Great. Whats this? These are Daviss fathers records. Do what you think is right. One, two, three, four - Warriors! - Double! Rear! Hesitate! March! Ahh... ahh... - damn! - Double! Rear! Change step! March! Ahh... ahh... - damn good! - Change step! March! Column left!

[ Together] Ten, nine, eight, seven, six... five, four, three, two, one, freeze! I said freeze! Squad, assume test positions! Huh! Sir.! Double-D squad reporting for final exam... sir. Hoo-ah! I feel sorry for Ophelia cause she kills herself. Cause first Hamlet dumps her, and then he kills her father. It was an accident, but he did it. that he really did love her. Suicide aint the way out. A lot of people are on their own, and they make it. - The ghost. - Excellent. - Benitez. - Uh, Yorick. Yorick. Yeah. Haywood. Laertes. Gimme somebody else. - Laertes, Haywood. - Laertes is a fool! He aint never stopped to think about what type of person Hamlet was. All he does is do what the king tells him to do. When he fights Hamlet, all they do is end up killin each other. Thats his problem. He dont stop and think before he acts. I want somebody else, Bill. [ Bill ] Queen Gertrude. Fortinbras. What did we learn from the graveyard scene? - Leroy. - Well, maybe it means something, maybe it dont, but, um-- Well, I can see why the gravedigger say he went to work the very day Hamlet was born. I mean-- Well, its kinda funny when you think about it. The day youre born, you start to die. You see, when Hamlet see that skull in the graveyard, he see the light. Skull aint got no tongue, you see? Thats why later, when Hamlets lyin there, dyin... he wont let his man Horatio kill himself. Say, Nah, man. Im already gone. Dont fall on your sword for me. ""You gotta go on and be my tongue... tell my story, so I can live on. You dig what Im sayin? Its deep, ya know? - Yeah, its way deep. Two times. - Yeah. All right. Two times, baby. Three times. So what do we get out of this play? Melvin. Ya know... all the people in the play-- the kings and the queens and the princes-- they all die. And in the end, all thats left is the two guys... Fortinbras and Horatio. A soldier and a student. Aint that somethin? That is something, Melvin. Some eight or nine weeks ago, a young man or woman... apprehensively boarded a train, plane, or got into a car... and began a journey to become a part of something... they only knew vaguely as the army. Thats Marie over there. - [ Colonel James ] They did not go away to do something. - [ Bill ] See? This is Emily. My daughter. [ Emily ] Hi. I met her here. Well, you could tell. - Shes cute. - Thank you. Well, shes very nice. Today, we see them on this graduation field. They are somehow stronger, prouder... more mature, changed. Today, you fine young men and women... assume your positions as guardians of Americas future... and that future looks bright indeed... for both you and your country. But we must never forget our debt of gratitude to the past... and those who have served the army so bravely... and so well. That is why I am especially proud... to dedicate this ceremony... to a fallen, but not forgotten, American hero. A young radio operator serving in Vietnam... whose platoon came under mortar attack near the outpost at Soc Trang. This soldier held his post under fire... to relay coordinates... which facilitated an artillery response. This soldier gave his own life... in order to prevent the loss... of so many others. I want to thank a civilian instructor... for pointing out this oversight... Mr. William Rago... for his efforts in seeing that the family of this fallen soldier... receives the honor he so richly deserves. Company, attention! Son, its an honor to present to you... your fathers silver star. About face.! [ Band Plays Washington Post March ] [ Drill Sergeant ] Eyes right.! Gee, theyre tough. To the right, march!
