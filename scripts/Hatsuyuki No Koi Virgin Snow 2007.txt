Well, I can't speak Japanese at all. But that's actually good. Now I've got an excuse not to study. God... Oh yeah, my name is Kim Min. You're bleeding. I fell off my bike. Are you Korean? Yes. What's that? That. Omikuji. Omikoji? Fortune teller. Fortune tell... Right! Fortune telling! You can buy one there. It's all in Japanese. What does it mean? It's Daikichi. Daikichi? Lucky. Very lucky. Very lucky. I think so, too. You may tie only bad luck omikuji' here. Just the bad ones only here. Your omikuji is good. Please keep. Oh, keep? Nanae, come here! Okay. Please keep. With lucky. Lee Jun-ki Miyazaki Aoi VIRGIN SNOW Min, let's have breakfast. Help yourself. No kimchi? In Rome do as the Romans do. Anyway, why is this soup bowl so small? And don't we need something like a spoon for this? They don't use a spoon in Japan. Since you'll be here for a year, try to take some interest in Japan. Not bad. What is this? Beating Japan with 365 words For picking up girls? Thank you. 'Otosu'. To tempt and succeed. I love this word. Yes! What a great day. Aren't you...? Huh? Do monks go grocery shopping, too? Move! Move! Move! Move! Move! Move! Class, this is Kim Min. He came here with his father, an exchange-professor in Japan. He doesn't know Japanese too well, so please help him. Yes! Well, Min's seat is... Ma'am, here. Hello. Oh, you can speak Korean. Quality Guaranteed Quality Guaranteed. My name is Assa Kaori. Nice to meet you. Assa Kaori. Yeah, Assa Kaori. Her name wasn't the only thing that was funny. Let's go and eat something. - Okay, let's go. - Let's go. Okay. What's he doing? Hey, what are you doing? Hey! You can't hear us? - Huh? - Yeah, you. I mean, where are you from? You're stealing this bike, huh? Give it back. Sometimes feet are faster than words. Black Belt in Taekwondo, Kim Min Who is this girl? Bastard still knows how to break the mood. You've already picked up a girl? You just got to Japan. First say 'hi' at least? How's Japan? Bet it's tough because of the language barrier. That's why I told you to learn music like me. Yeah, so how's the drumming going? Just playing, that's all. And don't forget to eat. Okay. Take care of yourself. Where are they? Min! Min, why are you so late? The first class is gym. Huh? Don't you have a gym suit yet? Gym suit. Gym suit? Here we are. Min, the guys go there. Hurry up. Ippon! Coach, he used to be a fencing champion in Korea. Really? I want to have a match with him. Hey! I heard that you used to be a fencing champion in Korea. Why don't you take this chance to show us what you got? What's he saying? Oh, a welcoming ceremony! Now you notice who I am! Good to see you! I look great, don't I? Huh? - Fight! - Wait! I said wait! Give it to me. Damn it. Come here! This sucks. Fine, you're going down. Here I go! Min! Min! Min! Min! Bring him some water. Okay. I'm sorry. It was my fault yesterday. I thought that you were stealing the bike. What's he saying? Is he apologizing to me? Where are you going? Min! Min! What's wrong? Forget it! Wait! Min! - What's the matter? - Wait, Min! Nanae! Ohm no! Nanae cherishes that. What are you going to do now? Oh, no! The stream's too shallow! Mom, you're drinking again? Whatever... You'll kill yourself like this. Shut up! You got something to say? If you do, tell me now. Hi, Yuri. What's with you? You got something to say too, Yuri? Thank you. - Thank you. - Thank you. See you again! Kojima! What is it?

Good morning. Here you are. For me? 'Me' dropped it like this, so... I can't accept this. I mean... 'Me' dropped yours like this, so I bought this for you... I can use mine. They're still good. Rain. Hey. You did the show to buy that for me. What? Ching Ching Dong Dong What? Ching Ching Dong Dong You saw me? How embarrassing. Rain. Rain. Rain. Rain? Rain! Thank you. Past. Sorry. This. Take. Please. Min. For me? Gratitude for the painting tools. Thank you. To Min, With all my thanks. From Nanae Why? Want to learn pottery? No, I don't want to touch that poop stuff. Poop? What you're saying is poop. What does the card say? Does it say that she likes me? What kind of girl would like you? It says, cut your hair. Forget it. Better off you don't say anything. It says, 'With all my thanks.' Whoever she is, she thanks you with all her heart. Yeah? Then what does 'Ookini' mean? It's the Kyoto dialect for 'Thank you.' Thank you. Dad! Ookini Let's hurry. - Hi. - Hi. What the hell...? Let go of me! Let go of me, man. Are all Koreans like you? Push. Push. Push? Yeah, that's not the way. Japanese girls, especially Kyoto girls... They are 'okuyukashii.' - 'Okuyukashii?' - Understand? 'Hazukashi gariya.' 'Hazukashi.' Oh, shy? Yeah, right. Don't hurry. Slow please. Slow... Slow... - Slow... - Slow... You bastard. So, this could be a good weapon for you. Brand new phone? 0 yen Okay! Look out the window. The heads of5 Southern Asia countries are... Now it's the capital city of Sri Lanka And after the prime ministers of China and India have a meeting... The five principles of peace... Teacher. Yesterday... Present... Thank you... So I... will show you around Kyoto. I think... I should guide you. No. I will guide you. Good? Okay. Pottery shop. My father makes pottery. Pardon? My father makes pottery. He's a 'potter'. Your father is a potter? Yes. 'Kiyomiz Jagi'. 'Kiyomiz' what? For Kiyomizu porcelain, its potter is different from its painter. The potter makes the porcelain, and the painter paints on it separately. So there's a porcelain maker, and then a painter. - Separately. - Separately. Separately. Okay, I got it. How about this? Later, 'me' make the porcelain... And Nanae paints on the porcelain I make, okay? Promise? - Promise? - Yeah, 'yakusoku.' 'Yakusoku' in Japanese, too. 'Yakusoku.' Dad, teach me how to make porcelain. I thought you didn't want to touch poop. Please teach me how to make it. You have to beat it hard to make it easy to work with.. I know that part. So teach me how to make porcelain, not how to beat mud. I have to make a big dish. That's why I'm teaching you this. Want to know more about her, right? Well, it's not that... Try it. - Like this? - Yeah. Give it to me. There is much air in the mud. So if you don't press it out of the mud, It'll crack when you bake it. The beginning for anything is the most important. Okay. Now, let's do it. 'Hello'. Konnichiwa 'Hello.' 'I'm Yamada Keiko.' 'I'm Yamada Keiko.' 'I'm Nanae.' 'It's nice to meet you.' 'It's nice to meet you.' It's nice to meet you. 'It's nice to meet you.' 'It's a great day.' A promise made with fingers seems much stronger than with words. I didn't want to study for myself, but now I'm studying for Nanae. I study Japanese and pottery. Nanae studies Korean and painting. It was the beginning of our beautiful summer. 'Tsuyu' is over. 'Tsuyu?' What is 'tsuyu?' 'Tsuyu' is rain much much. - Rain much much. - Rain much much. Rain much much is 'Jangma' in Korean. How do you pronounce it? - Pronounce? - Pronounce. - It's pronounced 'Jang'. - 'Jang'. - 'Ma'. - 'Ma'. - 'Jang'. - 'Jang'. - 'Ma'. - 'Jangma'. Okay. Excuse me. Hello? Nanae. Yuri, what's wrong? Come home quickly. What happened? I'm scared. That man is beating mom. Okay, I'll be there in a minute. I'm sorry... I home... 'Kaeru.' 'Kaeru?' I'm sorry. I have to go. Nanae! Nanae! Nanae, hurry! Stop it! Please stop! Stop it! What are you doing? Stop it. I'll kill you! Why didn't you listen to me! Stop it, please! Get off of me! Yuri. Stop it. You bitches! I'll call the police! Stop it. I'm sorry. It was my fault. Let's go outside, huh? Come on. Nothing could compare to Nanae's smile. But I felt the loneliness behind her smile. I should've... asked her then the reason for her loneliness. Do you want to go on that? That boat. They break up. I mean in the legend. If a couple takes a ride in the boat, they will break up. So if a couple rides on the boat, they will break up? There's something like that in Seoul, too. 'Doldam' street. 'Doldam' street by Deoksu Palace. 'Dorudam' street. If a couple walks on Doldam street, they will break up. If they go on a date on the first snowfall, the couple will be happy. First snowfall? Date? First snowfall and date, then happiness. 'Shiawase?' Yes, 'Haengbok.' 'Haengboku.' The boat is minus. And the Doldam street is minus, too. Minus and minus is plus. So let's walk on Doldam street on the first snowfall. Promise. Promise. In Korean style, we stamp... Sign like this and copy... Copy. Let's go. This is my favorite place in Kyoto. Your favorite? Memory note. People write down what they want on the note. I wish that time would stop now. Yuri! No! No! Let go of me! What are you doing? Please get out of here. Please get out. I beg you! Please get out! You didn't press the air out of the mud. Still don't get it? It's because I have no time! Start again with the kneading. Hello? Where were you? I've called you many times. Why? What's wrong? I'm at Incheon Airport now. Incheon Airport? Why? Your grandmother suddenly fainted. Grandmother? Why? Is she okay? She's over the critical stage. She wants to see you very much. Okay. Dad, tell her that I'm coming to see her very soon. Okay, come as soon as possible. Alright. Hello. You look pretty. Kimono? Yukata. Yukata. Present for the 100th day anniversary. It's my first work of porcelain. You made this? Charm. Don't open it yet. Not now. Min. What's wrong? Nanae! Nanae! Min! Nanae! Min, you gave me courage. You gave me laughter. And I want to be with you forever. But I can't see you any more. What? My promise to paint on your porcelain... I want to keep that promise. I can't hear you! Along with the promise that we will walk on Doldam street together. But... Good-bye. Don't open it now. - Here you are. - Thank you. You're welcome. Thank you. Grandma, are you all right? You came all the way from Japan? Of course, to see you. You didn't have to do this. Come on, mom. You were dying to see him. Was I? Anyway, what's that there? What? Oh, you bought this for me from Japan? Oh, yes. Thank you so much. - It's pretty, isn't it? - Yes, so lovely. One, two, three, four. - Hey. - Hey, what's up? Been a long time. Practicing hard, I see. - Here you are. - Thanks. By the way, how's your grandmother? She's gotten much better. Can you wait for me a bit until I finish practicing? We have a lot to catch up on. Of course, I will. Go and finish. - Okay, wait for me. - Sure. The number you have dialed is not in service. Please check the number and call again. Hello? Min? Kojima. What happened to Nanae? Even Kaori doesn't know what happened to her. Nothing? Even Kaori? Yeah, someone visited her home, But she'd moved... What? Move the house... For sale Move? I mean she's gone. She's gone. She seems to have suddenly moved away. Even her friends can't reach her. You're bleeding. I just fell from the bike. She's gone. Two years later, Kobe Nanae! Nanae is that really you? Yes. - You... - You go to Kobe University? No need for that now. Let's talk about it later. Why'd you vanish all of a sudden? I'm sorry. My parents used to love each other so much. But ever since my father died in an accident, my mom started acting strange. Hurry up. She drank out of depression and loneliness. Then she met a violent man, and got hurt by him even more. She turned into a totally different person. Please get out. I felt that if we had stayed longer, someone would die. That's why. Are you okay now? Yes, he's in jail now because of another crime. Then... what about your mom? She's under medical treatment. She's gotten much better. Did you hear about Min? He went back to Korea at the start of the second semester. He said that he had no more reason to be in Japan. Thank you. Good-bye. Nanae! Nanae! Here you are. Why didn't you finish the porcelain? When will you paint on it? Are you still in bed? Oh yeah, your show's today, right? Where was it? The City Gallery. Yeah, Deoksu Palace. I'll be waiting. Nanae, this way, please. - Hello. - Hello. Congratulations on your acceptance. Thank you. Nanae, can you speak Korean? Nanae, can you speak Korean? - No. - She said 'no'. Where are the places in your paintings? Where are the places in your paintings? It's Kyoto. It's my favorite place. Min! It's been a long time. How have you been? Why are you here? Did you come to see me? No. My paintings... Paintings? I thought so. What am I doing here? Min, Korean is too hard for me. Can you speak Japanese for me? Japanese? I don't know Japanese at all. Ever since you left me without a word, I don't care to know any Japanese. Rain. Rain. Very lucky? I don't believe in this any more. With all my thanks. From Nanae. Who made this? Me. I did. This seems to be yours. Min, I can't see you for a while. But for the times We've been together, I've been very happy. I wish I could stay with you forever. But I have to leave Kyoto today. Please take care until the day we meet again. It's called a camellia. The flower's meaning is... 'Constant love'. December 31, 2004. On the first snowfall of this year, I waited for Min on Doldam street. But Min didn't come. It was the second snowfall today. I'm waiting for Min here. Will he come next year? December 11, 2005. Seoul had its first snowfall on December 3rd. Kyoto has its first snowfall today. Nanae. It's snowing. Isn't it the first snowfall? Yeah, it's so beautiful. Will he come next year? Taxi! If a couple has a date on the first snowfall, they will be happy. First snowfall date? First snowfall and date, then happiness. Driver, - let me off here. - But we still have a long way to go. It's okay. First snowfall, date, promise, I believe... You dummy! What are you doing here in this cold weather? How long have you been waiting for me here, huh? Min... Min... As much as you've been waiting for me. I'm sorry. Thank you. # I mean, # if I don't believe in # the sorrow of god, # can you smile for me? # I sigh deeply # because of my poor love. # I look at the horoscope # and predict what our poor love will be. # I really want to # meet you the next life again. # Oh, the wind blows # and it's like your smile. # I'm sending you # the flower language of Bougainvillea. # Oh, I feel so anxious. # I wrote the lyric poetry for you # in the windy day's afternoon. # I mean, # if I couldn't meet you # in that place, at that time, # what would our future be? # I read the never ending story for you. # You pretend to be strong but actually you're a crybaby. # Poseidon is running on the wide sea # with his cobalt color memory. # I really want to # meet you the next life again. # Oh, the wind blows...
