Romeo and Juliet Race, homeland, nation, unification, uh, patriotism, integration, compatriots, goodwill, makes me sick. Rulers, repression, slaves, no, subjects? Aggression, discrimination, exclusion, chosen ones, blood, mixed, pure, union... Was born in Japan. As a so-called ''Korean-Japanese.'' Don't think l'm any different. They call me this. Zainichi! Enough. No. This is my love story. Three years ago Don't be chicken on me. OK. Tawake, how many have made it? One who made it 10 years ago died on a Yakuza job. l'm the only survivor. So it's called ''Super Great Chicken Race.'' ''A train is approaching platform 2, please stand behind the line.'' You idiot! Coming! Run! Go! Hey! Wait! Wonsu! l'm a legend! Not bad! Pigs are comin'. Faster, idiot! Another! C'mon asshole! Under arrest! Let go! Are you the father? Hello... What? You're not? Father, right? He, he's gonna get killed! Lady, lady! Hey, um... P-p-please... Look. Didn't have to go to family court. Be grateful. Say thanks. Kill you. Didn't mean it. l'll say it again, 'This is my love-story'. SUGlHARA Here we are in Hawaii. Beautiful blue sea, blue sky. And next... Here. You can't beat father, you know. He ranked 7th in Japan. Hey, let me do it myself! No, l do it best. Let me do it. l can do it better! Hawaii... Hawaii... Yes! What, you wanna go there? Go where? To the ''symbol of corrupt capitalism.'' ldeologies go out-of-fashion. The Soviets lost out to the cold. The cold freezes your nose. Same with ideology. Where are you going? Hawaii. Huh? Let's go to Hawaii. He's gone senile. (Don't need this anymore.) (l want a passport.) (You can go as a North-Korean these days, you know.) Hey buddy, l'm a real Marxist. A spy... (l might be a spy.) (Pretty stubborn.) (Not a problem.) Go, if you want! No use. Can't talk sense. l just want to go to Hawaii. (Let's switch.) Anything can happen. (Switch it.) (Switch it.) Just for a trip to Hawaii, he gave up his North-Korean citizenship, and became a South Korean. That stupid picture is still at the front door. So, now l should call them ''mom and pop.'' Stop the car, mom. Huh? Pull over. Get out. Sit down. Have a good look. What'll you do? What? Easily change your nationality. Be an American or Russian if you got money. Wish the scenery was better. See the world, and, decide for yourself. The ocean stared at me. And l stared right back. So l thought about it. l thought hard about my futureless existence. Hey there, scum. What are you up to? Causing a disturbance. Move. What the fuck. Just looking. Wha-, what the hell ! Japanese eventually mix into society. But as for me... The fool of the North Korean school... this is me. Looking for a job, after university... ...this is it. Work to be a doctor or a lawyer... My nickname is ''Stupid'' so forget it. l hated marches, classical music and raisin curry. Stupid Stupid But l had a right to choose. (Where you going?) North or South Korean national. A narrow choice. But l felt like a person for the first time. Decision made. Turning South Korean. Really? But not going to hawaii. Going to Japanese school. So sudden. Seeing the world. Whatever. l gave up smoking, fighting and, ...entered Japanese school. And now, this is me. But people don't change easily. Thanks to this, l got my break. Where's Sugihara? You? Not me. You, asshole? Wrong. Who is it? After leaving basketball, the challengers lined up. l'm 24 for 0 now. l'll make you famous. What the hell is that? What 'Billy The Kid' said. l know Captain Kidd. Buried treasure? Hardy, har, har. Right. Hardy, har, har. Har, har. har, har. Hey! Sugihara! The leader Malcom X said something really cool. Self-defence isn't violence. lt's intelligence. Totally right. l hate violence, but, sometimes have no choice. l hate hitting, but hate getting hit more. That's all. l knew it. The Revolutionary History. Textbook from North Korean school. What l'm doing is revolutionary, so it comes in handy. You hit that guy with an iron dumbbell. lt was an ashtray. l just heard a rumor. Kato was the first to challenge me. What? Huh? lt's bubbling. Eh? Bubbling. Kato was the only son of a Yakuza boss. He should've told me. Daddy. Looks better than before. Really? Looks good, sonny, like that guy., Keanu Reaves. Better than before. And Brad Pitt eyes? Eyes are good as they are. Yes, yes, eyes are good as they are. Sugihara, Thought l'd have you cut off a finger, but it's OK. Yes, sir.. After that, somehow we became friends. Sugihara, it's my birthday. Buy you a coffee. No need. l mean, l'm having a party tonight. Lots of cuties. 5000 yen's nothing. Don't be down 'cause a counter went under. lt's not that. Hurts that two went under at once, but l still got two. So what? Mom's left the house. You reap what you sow. He can buy a new car, but l can't learn flamenco. What is it? Same uniform but different. Shut up. Hey! Washroom. Waitress, dessert! A whole pineapple. Hey, it's Stupid. Hey. What's with the hair? Real symbol of capitalism. lt was two and a half years since we met. At North Korean school we had ''self-criticism time.'' Speaking Japanese was forbidden. (Seong-Mi.) (Today Wonsu used Japanese.) My teacher Mr. Kim really loved self-criticism time. His nickname was ''Kim Satan'' . (Wonsu) (come forward.) (What did you say?) Gotta take a shit. (l had to take) ''a shit.'' (What's wrong) (with saying) ''Gotta take a shit?'' (Well,) (how should l say) ''Gotta take a shit?'' (l have to defecate). (that doesn't sound right) (so l used) ''shit'' (in Japanese.) (Now,) (how many times you say) ''shit''? (1 ,) (2,3...) (6 and a half) (Stand up!) (Anyone else who used Japanese?) (He used it too?) (Going to Japanese school.) (Stand up!) (What is it?) (Traitor to the race!) (Stand up!) (l'm standing.) (Fucking with me?) Since then l was marked as a traitor. Heard you're wearing jeans, and listen to Mariah Carey. And you ''laborers'' are ordering desert. Hey stupid, still a fighter like before? Holiday tomorrow so... l told you it's Mariah's concert. Goddamn pussy! Asshole! Ouch! Shut up! Hey lady, lady... Don't be smart! No Korea or Japan when you're young. You're just kids! Shut up and eat. Look, you left all this meat, and you order desert! Too young for beer too. Boys should drink milk. Milk ! He really got me but l hit him with, ...a counter-punch... Sugihara? You came. Present. Cool. Got LSD and pot. Want some? OK, enjoy. When l told my friend l was moving back home, he said, ''Go to Yoshiwara, you should see the geisha on display.'' l heard one shouldn't go, one can catch a life- threatening disease, so one should stay away. l said l wasn't interested. He said, ''Just have a look, no problem with looking.'' So he took me along with him. First time l saw geisha. They were so beautiful. But the exquisite Takao was like nothing l'd ever seen. More elegant than a painting. Completely unlike a human being. Said l'd like her to serve me, and my friends laughed. Told me she was for the highest classes, so l should give up dreaming. l decided to buy a painting of her. From then on, she was always before my eyes. When l picked up my brush l saw Takao. l even saw her in the rice l ate. l saw Takao in everything. Even when l'm talking here... Mister, you're being a fool. This bald guy looks like her? Right then, l remembered. This is my love story. l'll set you up with her. Whatcha reading? The C-c... Catcher in the Rye? Something like that. Doesn't suit you. Hey, heard of psychometry? Sugihara, right? How - ? l read it. And, a strong fighter. Right? l wonder. Basketball. What? H-how did you? Tell you later. Later? Let's take off. Crowded, noisy, and boring, right? Hey. You read that too? l don't know you, but should l? You're too polite. Hey... What's that? Cool. Thanks. Haven't been here since marching practice. What are you listening to? Ra-, ra-p. Japanese? Maybe. What kind of music do you like? Lotsa stuff. But not Japanese music. Why? l wonder. Don't like it either. Why? l wonder. We're the same. Like movies? Yeah, action movies. l like Fellini's La Strada, The Shining, and As Good As lt Gets, Magnolia, um, Enter the Dragon and... l saw that one three times! See Fists of Fury? No. lt's so cool. Lend it next time. Next time? What do you wanna be? Doctor or lawyer. Wow. But that's impossible so, l might do something totally different. Guys l know say they'll be famous. Just to impress you. How about you? l'll be Jean Claude Van Damme. Your pronunciation sucks. Sorry. Tell me your name? Who cares about names. Um... Sakurai. Won't tell you my first name. Hate it. Miss Sakurai. l'm Sugihara. l know. l read it. But couldn't read your first name. Won't tell you. Hate it. Yeah, who cares. No way. Huh? You see that? Falling star? Never been so embarrassed. Why? A falling star! Can't see a falling star with a guy. Maybe. lt's true. l wonder. So embarrassing. Totally caught off-guard. Hey, l saw your panties. You wish for something? Don't tell anybody, it's our secret. OK. Busy on Sundays? l meet my friends. Got a girlfriend? No girlfriend. l hate liars. Sorry. As l thought. This is... traditional comedy. Lied before. Lot l didn't tell her yet, but there were no more lies. Go ahead of me. Want to see you jump. As you wish. Jumped back then too. Call me. Shouldn't she wave goodbye? C'mon, let's go. Really? Seems mom hasn't come back. Dad taught me how to box since grade 4. Extend your left arm, kid. Now make a circle. Good. You're as big a man as the circle, ...you made with your fist. Understand, kid? ln the circle, basically you're safe as far as you can reach. What do you think? Uncool. That's boxing, break through with your fist, and take from the outside. Lots of tough guys outside. They come inside your circle. Hurts to hit or get hit. Still wanna box? Safe inside the circle. l'll box. Alright. Told you it wasn't a good idea. Like rain falling from heaven. Huh? Wonder if heaven's a nice country. Alright! What's that? Spanish. Wanted to be a Spaniard a long time ago. What's the point? Find out yourself. Dad. Hey, go for a run, will ya? Make up with her. Look stupid running like that. Two weeks later, they went to Spain, country of passion. Thanks, man. How was it? l like the sick insect story. And the rotten tofu one. Vinegar Tofu? Thought so. This is Jong-il. The guy l respect the most. Got me into comedy. (Bastard! l'll kill you!) (What happened?) (This guy...) (This guy...) (...is going to Japanese school.) (ls this true?) (Yes.) (lt's a good thing.) (You'll know the truth about the mother country,) (enter Japanese society, and be an ambassador) (for your compatriots...) (l won't forgive you!) (Please stop.) (Stand up!) (Traitor to the race!) (Betrayer of your country!) We never had a country! (Try and say that again.) We never had a country. Never forgot what Jong-il said, and how he saved me. Going to enter university? Still thinking. But not looking for work. Why? Can't be president. Don't even have a chance. Just get eaten up by the system. A nightmare! Why not think about it in university? Waste of time. You should live a wasteful life. You're already off track. Eat up, young men. Let's eat. Hey, what part of the pig is this? (Testicle.) B-ball... Fool. This guy may look like a real geek, but, he's the genius of the school. Hey. Really? Um, the name again? Jong-il. Jong-il, Jong-il. Mother's Japanese and father's Korean. Not Japanese school? That's what makes him so cool. He wants to teach at North Korean school. To his future followers. Wow, that's really great. lsn't he cool? No big deal, really. My dream is to do comedy. Yeah, the coolest Zainichi. You do comedy? And... The master here? Shut up! l mean, if this guy becomes a teacher, the North Korean school will change. Like a sudden variation in DNA. No, like l saw on TV, by tracing Japanese DNA, of a mother, grandmother, great grandma and further, many go back to China or Korea. And by going way, way, way, way back... we go back to monkeys 200,000 years ago. And going way, way back... Sorry, what are we talking about? Got out of hand. No, l know what you meant. My sister wants to go to Japanese school. What grade? Grade 9 Next year. l'm worried. Not strong like you. Give me some advice? Anytime. Oh yeah, read this. Works of William Shakespeare Got traditional comedy characters? No, but read it. lt's cool stuff. Why the Parliament? Why? No. Just a strange place to meet for a date. Only one so you can't miss it. l see. And it's cool too. Really? OK, let's go. 1 ,2,3,4, 5,6,7,8,9, What? After 9 steps polar bears step back. No way. 1 ,2,3,4,5,6, 7,8,9, lt's true. Why? To keep calm. So they don't lose control in their small pen. 1 ,2,3,4, 5,6, That was 7 now. Odd numbers are OK. You said 9. Forget it, next. Since then, l met Sakurai on Saturdays. That was - 1 - now. At that time, Kato got suspended for doing drugs. A lady! A lady! lt's a deer! Deer! Wonsu got caught at class. (How do l say) ''get me a porno mag''? (Please buy me an adult magazine.) That just doesn't sound right, so l said ''get me a porno mag''! Mom met a famous actor. l'm your fan. lt's really you, Yasu? Love your movies. Just private... Have some milk, Keep you fit. And with mom coming and going, lots was going on. And in my case... Ouch. This is me. Just like Bruce Lee, right? Let's go. Stupid to lend the video. That day Sakurai said let's try walking on the white line as far as we can. How many girls you dated? One. So few. And you? One too. Left a college guy 6 months back. You're an adult. Used to like confident guys way back. Just 6 months ago. Girls have a phase like that. Wanna know how far l got with him? l'd rather not know. What's that? What's what? Brothers and sisters? Only child. Got an older sister. Hometown? Don't have... a hometown. Mom and pop are from Yokohama and Kyushu. What? Was told to call them ''mom and pop'', but didn't even if l got hit... Your dad hits you? Sometimes. Really? Put on your shoes. Feels better this way. Go, go straight ahead. Alright, finished! Whose house? My house. Made an appointment. Appointment? For Sugihara. Thanks. My first dinner at a Japanese home. Would you prefer beer? No thanks. You like this country? My boyfriend heard this one before. Not too many countries without policy like Japan. Almost embarrassed to be Japanese. So l don't even vote. Um... Know the meaning of ''Japan''? Land of the rising sun? Some people think so, but there are other theories too, like it coming from ancient poetry. Not taught at school? Yeah. Point is, no one knows the meaning of the name. Not too many countries like that. And? And, that's the point. What does ''Japan'' mean? Land of the rising sun. But l thought that wasn't true. Let's go. Thank you. Some cantaloupe. Later. This? My pop's hobby. Over here. First name. No one said it down there. l told them. Look? Lick? Love... you. After that, we always met at Sakurai's house. We got closer together we did a lot of things l can't tell you but we didn't go all the way. Yes. Dad sent me. Thanks. Enjoy. Scared me. Oh yeah, want to go to the opera next Saturday? Opera!? Cavalleria Rusticana. Wanted to see La Traviata but it's not on. Opera... l'm going to the opera... Gotta save some money. Opera expensive? Maybe. By the way, does she know? Know what? About you... everything about you. Um... Thinking of telling her soon. Tell her after the opera. You remember the ''Great Chicken Race?'' Why you bring that up? You looked so cool back then. What, you were there? Recently, l remember how you were then. Tawake Remember Tawake? The real fast guy. He made it too. What's he doing now? Stupid, l... Yeah. gave my fingerprint. This is when foreign residents still had to give their fingerprints. Thought l'd give 'em a real good beating but... The girl with the forms had a bruise on her face. When l pressed my finger, She covered it up like this. l couldn't touch 'em. l said, ''Sorry''. Never kowtowed like that before. Finally got caught. Authority's scary. Don't run fast enough, you can't get away. Stupid, you're my ... successor. Get it. l heard after that incident Tawake quit school and became South Korean. Really. Wonder what he's up to. Gotta be running down some street. For sure. Get it. Just imitating Tawake. See ya. Stupid? Jong-il. What's up? Free tomorrow? Got something to tell you. Big thing. C'mon, tell me now. Not on the phone, in person. You'd understand. You're dirt if you don't pick up the Korean. More like shit. A real pussy. Bet 500 yen you can't. For good luck. Go. Excuse me. What is it? No, l didn't mean... What the hell! Ambulance! Call an ambulance! Somebody, please, call an ambulance! ln the end, Jong-il took the ''big thing'' to heaven. Jong-il really thought highly of you. Thank you so much, for being his friend. Mom. Hey. Skip school tomorrow. Why? You know why. lt's payback time for those bastards. What's the point? l'm asking you. You in or not? Jong-il wouldn't want it. Jong-il's dead, Stupid. Left us some business to take care of. He wants you to do it the most. What do you know about Jong-il? You hardly even knew him. You just want to get violent. Just want a sacrifice. Don't need your excuses. You sold your soul, man. lf l had a soul like that, l'd sell it for 20 yen. Wanna buy it? What's in a name? That which we call a rose by any other name, would smell as sweet. Should l stay, the night with you? l'll be with you, until you wake up. Why? Not sure but, that's what l'd want if l were you. l love you. What's the matter? Tell you something. l don't think it's a big deal but... l have to say it now. What? What is it? Just listen, listen to me. l'm ... l'm not Japanese. What do you mean? Like l said. My nationality's different. What is it? South Korean. North Korean until junior high. Might be Japanese 6 months later. What are you saying? l'm saying it doesn't matter. You were born and raised in Japan? Yeah. Education is different. North Korean school until Junior high. So l learned Korean. l mean, l'm bilingual. l can cheer for both Korea and Japan. Cool, right? ... That's it. Why? What's the matter? Pop told me when l was little... Don't go out with Koreans or Chinese. ls there... a reason for that? Don't know. Pop said... blood of Chinese and Koreans... is dirty. What's so funny? Sorry. Why apologize? l understand but... it's no use. My body... having you inside makes me... scared. You said it was no big deal. How could you, bring this thing up, and ruin everything. My first time. l was scared as it is. Say something. My first name, is Tsubaki. Like the Japonica flower. Tsubaki Sakurai, ...so Japanese l didn't want to tell you. My name is Lee Jong-ho. Like Bruce Lee. A totally foreign name. Scared to tell you. Hey you. Hey. Got 120 yen? OK. Man, want a coffee but don't have change. Why out so late? Well, um... Where were you? Over there. Your name and address? What's the matter? No way. Can't believe it. Gotta smoke? l wasn't made to be a cop. Never good at sports. Got a weak body, look stupid in uniform. Don't think so. l faint at the sight of blood. l'm sorry. Yeah, all l wanted was 120 yen. Thought l'd be arrested for not having my alien card. l'm South Korean. A South Korean. No, A resident. Residents have to carry an alien card? lmprisonment or a 200,000 yen fine. No way. Have to arrest you. Didn't even know. l dated a Korean girl once. Really? She couldn't cook. She made this awful Kimchi. Had to wash it first. But she was really cute. Had a Japanese girlfriend until now. Until now? Worried about stupid things. Like my pronunciation of names like Jean Claude van Damme. Could always see her panties. Awesome! She was so cute. What actress did she look like? Can't think of anyone. Maybe like... the actress who came to our parade? Forget her name. Whatever ! l got it. Yeah, l really loved her. l didn't mind discrimination before, but l got scared after l met her. l never met a Japanese l really loved before. Always got tripped up. l told her l was a Japanese-born Korean. And? Scary. No way. Sometimes l wish my skin was green. That way l'd always know l'm Korean. They'd stay away from the ''scary'' guy. l sometimes wish l had a more stupid uniform. A sailor suit or leotards. People wouldn't ask for directions. Gotta go. Yep. Good luck. lf you're a good guy, they'll come. Don't worry. Get some chicks sometime. Stationed over there. Hello. Could you please come to pick me up? Been a while since you been this drunk. l'm sorry. Lucky night? The opposite. What? Got two phone calls in a row. First, another exchange counter went under. Second, l got a call from North Korea. And? Tae-Hyun died. Tae-Hyun was my dad's brother. ln other words, my uncle. He went back to North Korea in the 50s. Never was able to meet him. When my dad became South Korean, the letters came to a halt. He was good at painting. When we were kids, he painted sunrises, on the bow of a fishing boat. Three days later, the boat hit a storm. When everyone lost hope, it came back the next day. After that he became a famous painter. He'd paint on the boat and get food for it. Yeah, We ate crab for the first time. So delicious we cried. Yeah, Should've sent him crab. Wonder if, he ever ate crab up north. All BULLSHlT ! Enough poverty stories. Why not a revolution to eat crab? Nobody's crying any more. Get it fucking together! Your generation never did shit! He's your father! No father of mine. Sir, can l hit him? Now, now. Just a punch drunkard. Driver. Can you go over to that park? Be finished in 3 minutes. Even if he lost his brother or business, he has no right to whine. l'll be the first to knock him down. Kids these days carry weapons. Need a bell, a bell. The Champion! Let your guard down, fool. You cheated. Cheated ? l always found a way to win, and that won't change. Asshole. What you say may be right. lt's not our time anymore. Talking about Zainichi and Japanese is bullshit, as you like to say. You guys should be open-minded. l'll wipe out borders. Remember, our ancestors have been liars since the Lee Dynasty. Sir, l found it. l found it, here. Will the business be OK? Yeah, l saved up enough for mom and l to get by. lf we go back to zero, that's OK. Can't take care of you though. l'll kill you if you touch pop again. l'm the one who got hurt. Ouch! Look, the love of a wife for her husband. Shut up. Stupid husband ! Why you hitting me? l'm sorry. Why the stupid picture in our entrance? Why the change in their nationality? lt wasn't to go to Hawaii. lt was for me. My father tried to take the shackles off my legs. Going to college. Really? By the will of Jong-il. As you like. (l'm not Korean or Japanese. l'm grass without roots.) 6 months later Quick. Hey. Stop singing and get it. Power's out. Hello. Hello Long time no see. How are you? l'm OK. You remember the school where we met? Go there. l'll be waiting until you come. Said you need a false tooth. Shut up. What am l? Goddamn it! What am l? Answer. What am l !? Japanese-born Korean ! How can you call me a ''Korean'' like that? By calling me ''Korean'', means l'm a stranger leaving the country! ls that what you're saying? Feel like killing you fucking Japanese sometimes. Scare you guys, don't l Need to fucking call me somethin' ! Right? OK, l'm a lion. Lions don't think they're ''lions''. You fucking gave 'em that name. Come near me, and l'll rip your neck off. Any name is OK. Viper, scorpion, why not an 'alien'? But l don't think l'm a fucking alien! l'm not a Korean or ''alien'' . l'm ME. No, l'll give up being me. l'm a fucking question mark. A BlG unknown. That scary? Fucking say something! Goddamn it! Don't like it? l don't give a shit! Those eyes. l loved those eyes. The other day, l was depressed by bad test grades. Somehow, l was really impressed, You were so cool the way you kicked that guy. When l saw you on the court, all my problems were nothing. So cool l couldn't stop laughing. l learned ''cool'' could be funny for the first time. Stop Sugihara! Sugihara. That's when l knew your name. Know what you did, don't you? Come along. This, is like then. Sorry l'm not psychic. When you stared at me, l got the shivers. Don't care what you are. Now l know. From the first moment l saw you, maybe, l already knew. Crying? Lots of tough guys outside. Have to break through. No way ! And it's Christmas Eve ! So embarrassing. This can't be! Let's go somewhere warm. We can think about where we'll stay. Wanted to tell you, your toothless grin is so cute ! Shut up. C'mon, let's go. The End
