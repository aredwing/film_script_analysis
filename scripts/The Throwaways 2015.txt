It's been a busy morning, waging my one-man war against jihadists, ass-hats and oppressive regimes. Today's lucky winner is Al Shamuhk, a jihadi recruiting and training website masquerading as a legitimate news organization. They're about to get their terrorist-sympathizing buttholes handed to them. Now I'm on to my next target. So, send me your recommendations because I'm taking requests. Blackjack out. Erik. Oh, man. You're still here? I thought I was too late. Too late for your birthday party? You blue-lined, man. They're coming. No. Look, I just found out, man. I'm sorry. Listen, if we don't get to speak again, I just want to let you know that I think what you've been doing is noble. Crazy, but brave. There's no way they... Good luck, brother. Son of a bitch. Son of a bitch. Ahab, you there? Aye aye, captain. Automated helmet Bluetooth link activated. He's running, he's running! Ahab, activate shredder! Shredder activated. Ahab, scan vehicles! Search for Wi-Fi and Bluetooth exploits! Showing vehicles vulnerable to multiple exploits. All right. Let's test their brakes then. Ahab, shut these guys down! 1962 Russian military vehicle. No known exploits. Hands up! Hands up! Hands up! Come on, not the bag. Come on now. Come on, guys. I'm scared of the dark. How you doing? Holden. I thought you were retired. - Yeah, I was. - Well, what the hell are you doing here? Well, I'm guessing that they liked me a lot and probably needed me, just like you might need me. And why exactly do I need you? Well, that way, you can keep from wearing your ass as a hat. Let's see. "Who is Blackjack?" Let us read. "A lone-wolf patriot waging a one-man cyber-war against a-holes." Now, I've known you since you were 14. What is this crap? Have you seen my operating tempo? Three targets in a month. SOCOM is not amused. So, they're arresting me? That's brilliant. They should be pinning a medal to my chest. I wanted to pin a waterboard on your back, Drew. Oh, I'm sorry. Are you Holden's new bitch? You think this is funny? Some kind of a joke? Hmm? No. Not at all, Agent Dolce. Is Agent Gabbana close by? Chicago's pitch black, Drew, 200,000 out of power. Someone changed the operating cycle on the generator, causing it to go out of control. We don't fix this in six hours, the plant will have irreversible damage, you understand? Chicago will be pitch black for weeks. Schools, hospitals, police stations. - You get it? - Okay, yeah. So, what does this have to do with me? Cyber-attacks. Someone hacked the plant. And this is your new golden boy? They can't hack that kind of thing. This has to be an implant. He's right. It's an implant. Do you happen to recognize it? - That's Pantheon. - I see. Up till a few hours ago, we thought it was you. No, this is impossible. You can't use Pantheon without the encryption key. You lost the key? - You created it. You can stop it. - No. No, no, I can't. That's the whole point. You need the key. If you have it, you control the implant. If you don't, some jihadi prick - gets to rule the world. - All right, listen. What's our next course of action? Stop shaving and learn Arabic. Now, listen. Let me ask you something. And I want an honest answer. This is really important to me and it's even more important to you. - Did you put in a back-door? - No. No, if I'd put in a back-door, that would've been illegal and I would've gone to jail. You're going to jail anyway. If there were a back-door, and I'm not saying that there is because there isn't, but if there were, I would want a signed immunity agreement before I revealed it. Holy shit, you really lost the key? I thought you were bluffing to get the back-door. This is really bad, you guys. Do you have any idea what's gonna happen? Yeah, there's a back-door. Just uncuff me so that I can use it. "REPORTER". With the entire city left in the dark, it may have been a cyber-attack. I could double the speed. Destroy it right now if you want. Bring Chicago to its knees. Crews now scrambling to figure out what caused the massive power outage. Police are on tactical alert as the fear and violence is starting to grow. I doubted you. But this is going to make you a rich boy. We appreciate your interest. Start the bidding at 10 million. What? Great, so I'll tell him. Thank you. Everyone, problem's over. Power will be on in five minutes. No damage. - All right. - Good job. Way to go, kid. What are you talking about? That back-door crap. It worked. - I didn't do anything. - What? I was locked out. I was locked out. Whoever stole the key patched the... Patched the back-door. They're good. They're leagues better than anyone you have working at SOCOM. I've been scrambling to find another way in, but without the encrypted key, there's nothing I can do. What are you saying? I'm saying that whoever has Pantheon turned it off themselves. Not me. Wait a minute. Why would they do that? That was a test run. They're showing what Pantheon can do. Pantheon is an implant. An implant is like a worm, only with a PhD and a nuke strapped to its back. We introduce it to a network and it propagates from there. Once it's in place, it lays dormant, waiting for a signal to wake it up and then it wreaks havoc. It's more dangerous than a standing army or a dozen nukes. All you need to control it is the encrypted data key. It's a physical key, it's one of a kind, it cannot be duplicated. The code changes every ten-millionth of a second in sync with the implant, so if you copy the key, it falls out of sync, you lose control. It's been spreading since 2008. So, coverage at this point is probably around 80%. Of what? The world. Every terrorist group and hostile government in the world is gonna try to get their hands on the Pantheon key. And if they do, they'll have the power to blackout any city, derail any train, melt down any power plant, all from a laptop, with just a few lines of code. The fact that the hackers who stole this didn't blow up Chicago tells me he's coin-operated, and that blanking out the city was just a demo. So that he can sell it to the highest bidder. You want to nuke Tokyo, flood Rio, burn Moscow or London, this is your guy. Whatever we do, we have to track him down and find him before he sells that key. Okay, then. Uh, Drew, here, will be a member of a team that Agent Connelly is putting together and I want you to know we're gonna put everything we've got out there to stop this thing, okay? So, thanks. Sir, with all due respect, he can't be trusted and we don't need a geek in the field. All due respect, all you need is me in the field, okay? This is not a team operation. That's why I left SOCOM in the first place. I work alone. I really don't remember asking either one of you for your opinion. So, shut the hell up, okay? Now, you will lead and, Drew, you will follow. Adios. Thank you, sir. - You don't want me on a team. - What? You don't want me on a team. I don't play well with others, okay? You know that about me. I mean, people are fine in the abstract, but up close and personal, they're the worst. I know that. I mean, I understand. I know you're very comfortable hiding in your trailer, playing with your little toys. See, but those days are kind of over. So, you got two options. A, you can take that wonderful talent you have and let it rot in a cell for 30 to 50 years, or, B, be a man and be useful, okay? You said I'd have immunity. This is Eastern Europe. I don't need to charge you. I've got three black sites within an hour's drive of here. I'm not going back. Drew. This is your code. There are millions, millions of people whose lives are at stake. And if I'm going to stop it, I need you. I know it's going to be really, really dangerous. I mean, horror of all horrors, you are going to have to deal with real people. Fine. But I get to choose the rest of the team. Because if Tom Slick chooses the team, I'm gonna be surrounded by frat boys with firm handshakes and five-year plans. Fine, I'll get you the dossiers on 20 of our top agents, and you pick. I don't want your dossiers, I can hack your personnel files. - And I sure as shit don't want your top 20. - Why, why, why? Because it's full of fast-trackers and yes-men, okay? No, I've got an algorithm. It will choose the best team scientifically. You picked these guys? They're throwaways, they're finished, washed up. I mean, maybe they'll use them for suicide missions. The numbers don't lie. This job, these are the best people. Have you read their files? Yeah, I glanced at them. Dan Fisher. He managed to roid-rage his way into blowing every one of his missions. He was kicked back to making copies in the embassy sub-basement. - Amalgamated vending. - Yes. Machine number zero, eight, nine, six... Thank you for calling with your concern. All of our operators are busy right now. Estimated hold time is 47 minutes. All you have to do is insert the change, press the button then, wow, fresh snacks. Hello! Gloria Miller. Swallow. Oh, come on, don't call her that. - What's a swallow? - He's right. It's just a disgusting term the KGB used to use. She's actually an agent who uses special weapons to get intelligence. Special weapons? Another happy customer, huh, Miller? Screw you, Langstrom. Listen, I got a lead from him on Ukraine. An FSB operative is coming in from Moscow tomorrow night. - And maybe I could intercept... - We can take it from here. Dmitri Stanislov. Former KGB. He speaks Russian. Yeah. According to his S.O., he's not good for anything else. You. You commie. He was on that failed Ukrainian Ministry Building run last month. You left me. I got cavity searched in a Ukraine prison because of you. Fuck. Dmitri! No, because of you. You were late. Dmitri, get back here! You blew the mission, not me. Because of me? Okay, no, guys, guys. You need to settle down. Well, you picked them. Go brief them. I said, get up and go fucking brief them. I ought to kill you right here. Oh, come on. You left me! I want an apology! You left me! I want an apology! You were late. Hey! Hi. I see you've been acquainted. Yeah, so, thank you for coming on such short notice. Who the hell are you? I'm... I'm Drew. Are you intelligence or an intern? I'm, uh, just... I'm, you know, just me. A private contractor of sorts. What do you do exactly? Well, that's difficult to describe, you know. I'm probably best known for CVE-2010-1807. But, you know, my passion is for Boolean operations and complex adaptive systems. - So, you know, it's natural that... - Drew! Christ's sakes, show 'em, will ya? Just show 'em! So, I'm just gonna show you guys. Name someone you actively dislike. Christopher F. Langstrom. For someone with his clearance, that was embarrassingly easy. Current tax return has him living on Glen View Terrace in Herndon, Virginia. It turns out you were correct. He is a world-class douche bag, he was actually diagnosed with Narcissistic Personality Disorder. How did you get his password so quickly? Well, he uses an NSA type 2 encryption, which he thinks is safe, but, really, there's a known vulnerability. And he's e-mailed himself all his passwords, so if you guys want to drain his bank account, we can do that. What else can you do? Uh, we could turn his phone into a listening device, or a live camera feed. Look, now I have his real-time location, and control over his vehicle. Three lines of code and I could send his car into a brick wall. So, what do you guys think? Should we kill this fucker? Yeah? Murder, anyone? Tell you what. Let's see the system. Looks like he's got another Gmail account. This one he uses for numerous affairs with female staffers. She's cute. So, what do you think? You want him divorced or fired? I'm tempted. Yeah, you don't have to raise your... Yes? I will do mission on one condition. You never go in my mail, okay? Because sometimes I have e-mailed pictures that are jokes. Not photos that turn me on, photos that turn very strange people on, understand? I'm driving this crap of junk? It's for surveillance, not for racing. Pick one. Go in. I'm good. Shotgun. No, I have pistol. No, I mean, I called the front seat. Speaking of shotguns, where's the heavy weapons? Can't I at least get an FIM-92? A what? A bazooka, man. A bazooka. You're not getting a goddamn bazooka. Would you rather be the guy who has one and doesn't need it, or the guy who needs one but doesn't have it? You're giving me a headache. Get in. You should at least give me some grenades, man. Uh-uh. No, no, no. Put it down, put it down. Not for geeks, it's for agents, okay? It's none of your business. Sir, are you sure about this? No. I can't find the Pantheon key, but the code did give me a line on who patched the back-door. I've got no name or photo, but I was able to track the IP address of whoever patched the back-door to this location. This is a skinhead bar. Great. Any chance we get, let's mix it up. - Excuse me? - These guys are nee-Nazis, right? It'd be a shame to come all this way and not bust a couple heads. Fisher, stop it. I just need to tap into the guy's computer and get some information, that's it. Yeah, Fisher. Low-profile, okay? No bazookas, no fist fighting, you understand? You stay in the van. Dmitri, come back me up. Impossible. What is he saying? I am one twelfth Jewish on my mother's side. These guys will kill me. English. Hey, English, okay? I drive. Ls better. I am driver. Pussy. Listen, I'll go in. But I should go alone. Right. I mean, how much tactical experience do you have? I speak hacker. I can talk to them. Right, well, that's why I'm getting wired, so you can stay in the van with the girl here and translate the geek-speak. Ow! Sorry. I had to reposition it. Listen, it's not as easy as just feeding you the lingo, okay? If I go in... Look, look. I go in alone. You stay here with the rest of the dropouts. What about me? You know, I could help. Um, there's no use for your skill set on this mission, - but you keep it warm and we'll find... - Test, test, test. Ow! Do you wanna wait till I go outside? I'm just testing the equipment. It's great. Here you go. All right, there's four assholes in here with laptops. What does he look like? Oh. Shaved head, black clothes, puke-white skin. Screw you, Drew. Hey, Dmitri, how's your Bulgarian? Hmm. Good enough for government work... and playing around with... prostitutes. That's good. I don't know what you said. Yeah. I need you to reply to this post, okay. This guy is a huge Levski football fan. - Yeah. - Yeah. So, why don't you say, "Ivo will be lucky to score three goals this season." "He's barely League One material." Ivo is their best player. He will score 20... I'm sure he's really, really good. - Best, best. - Yeah. Could you just write down exactly what I just said? .Okay-.Okay- - My typing is for shit. - Okay, that's all right. Wow. You're literally killing me right now. This isn't working. You need to go faster than this. All right, any day now. All right, pissing him off, pissing him off in three, two, one. All right, I got him. I'm headed in. Wait, wait, you can't just head in, okay. I haven't briefed you. These Bulgarian hackers specialize in anti-virtualization. Relax, I'll put this thing in the thing. I don't know why you geeks gotta complicate everything. Three vodkas. Stop him! Take it easy. Hey, Drew, they made me. - I warned you. - Okay, we'll leave now. Sit down, you yellow commie bastard! I'm going in. Fisher, sit down. Everyone, just calm down! Jesus, you're children. Hey, take it easy. All right. Ease off, guys. Connelly, if you want to live, repeat every word Dmitri says right now, phonetically, okay? All right. Reading Bulgarian, okay, but speaking, very different. I don't recommend, huh? Dmitri, listen to me. You're all I've got, okay. So, you need to translate this for me right now, okay. Take, here. You passed the test! On that SD card there are 120,000 credit card accounts. I'll sell them to you for 5,000 euros. I accept your offer of 5,000... and I will sell you back your life for 5,000. - I'm going in. - Fisher! Fisher, where the hell are you going? Are you gonna let these anti-Semite pieces of shit win? No way! Not me! Fisher, you don't need to go in there. The chip worked. I can get them to let him go. Bazooka time. Hey, everyone. I have an announcement to make. Shalom, motherfuckers. We have to help them. No, "0. no, no." Dmitri! Not again. - No! - What are you doing? Drew, get ready with the door. Go, go, go! Here. Yeah? Oh, slow down. - Was it random? - What do you mean? Was it just a robbery, or were you targeted? I can't say, but they were American. Was everything encrypted? Yes. Of course. That's good. You did everything right then. Go back inside and don't worry. Shit happens. Thanks, man. I got bit by a chubby, goulash-scented Nazi because Fisher here was born with an extra pair of testicles instead of a brain. - Wasn't goulash. - What? Goulash is Hungarian. The Nazi that bit you most likely smelled like chlopski posilek. - You don't get to speak. You ran. - What? I was not running. I was going to lead them away and then move back around. Fisher! Holden is looking for you. I thought I could hide up here. What exactly are you hiding from? You don't, uh... You don't remember me, do you? I had long hair and braces, and I was 30 pounds heavier. I had a beard. Reston Skateway. The year was 2000. Uh, I was playing Mortal Kombat. Mortal what? You don't know what Mortal Kombat is? No. It's a video game. Anyway, you were wearing this tight red, um... Uh, uh... It was like a half-shirt. And, uh, you asked me about hacking. I told you everything. I even made some stuff up to impress you. I'm sorry, I don't remember you. The Feds broke down my door a week later and charged me with 30 felonies. So, thank you. Thank you for not remembering ruining my life. What do you want? Some kind of tearful apology? No, I just... I liked you. And you said that you liked me. - And I know that was a long time ago... - Wait. Is that why you picked me? You wanted some kind of revenge? - Is that it? - No, I didn't want revenge. - No, no. - Look, I don't remember you. I was a virgin. Yeah? Well, we were all virgins once. Oh, God, amen. Hey, Drew, you wanna tell me what the hell we're doing here? The chip you put in the laptop didn't tell us the location of the Pantheon key. But it did tell us who's selling it. His name is Teebs, he's a black hat hacker who sells chaos to the highest bidder. So, we're here to take down this dweeb? - Kick his ass silly? - No, no. Teebs is a ghost. Nobody even knows his real name. We're looking for his broker. Broker? Why does he need broker? Well, when you're selling something ephemeral, like a zero-day, or an encryption key, black-market buyers want independent verification that what they're buying is legit. And the seller wants to make sure that they get paid. So, they hire a third party. This broker verifies and vouches for both parties and negotiates the terms. And what makes you think he's here? He's not. Not yet. But he will be. Every e-mail he sent Vitally originated from the public Wi-Fi here. This is like his office. Yeah, well, he better hurry up, because the next person who asks for a half-caf, no whip, I'm punching in the face. No, Fisher. No punching. No fighting, no kicking, no biting. Do you understand that? We're just gonna tail this guy. You got that? You and the geek stay behind if it gets bad. Geek squad, you read that? Yeah, my phone will ping me when he fogs on. My God, he's an asshole. Yeah, well, most of them are. So, you don't have a gun either? No. You know whatever's wrong with me that makes me good at computers makes me especially shitty at spatial tasking. What about you? I don't really need one with my skill set. That's bullshit. You know that, right? That's nonsense. You saved all of our lives. Maybe they're too proud to admit it, but I'm not. Well, maybe on the next mission they can reward me by letting me wear pants. I'm freezing. Well, I... I was, uh, smart this morning. And I have a layer. There you go. Oh, my God. I remember you from the skating rink now. You gave me your hoodie then, too. You insisted on driving me home. - You were sweet. - I was stupid. - It was sweet. - Nah. What happened to that guy? You happened to that guy. Hey, he's here. He logged in. Connelly. He's by you. The plaza. Fight, Fisher, headed your way. Got him. I guess he likes coffee. May I have a cappuccino, please? Make that a cappuccino. - All right, Miller, you're up. - I'm up? Do I need to spell it out? Connelly, we don't have to do it this way, all right. I'll approach him, I'll tell him I have a zero-day exploit to sell. There's no time for that. Listen, you don't have to do this. I've done worse. Besides, we're saving the world, right? Drew, relax, man. By all means necessary. Sometimes you gotta take one for the team. Excuse me, is there anyone sitting here? - No one, go ahead. - Thank you, you're very kind. It's really beautiful here. Are you from here? No, I'm not. Really? Me, neither. I'm American, what about you? Your coffee, sir. Thank you, love. He's a new guy. Did you see his eyebrow? He's a bad boy. I'm sorry. Could you just excuse me for a second? Wait. What? What happened? He's, uh, not into me. But I think Fisher might be his type. Hey, Fish. Sometimes we gotta take one for the team. By any means necessary, right? No way. Give him your number. Ask him to lunch. Give him my number? I ain't no swallow, okay. Male swallow is called "raven." I would have made a great one. Yeah, well, I ain't doing it, so forget it. Too late. He's on the move. Okay, spread out, but stay on him. Dmitri, he's headed your way. I see him. Dmitri, stay on him. Why would he pick Fisher over me? I am more manly. Better looking. Dmitri! Hey, hey. Don't get too close. I have a really strong signal, I can track him anywhere. I know now why he wanted Fisher and not me. He was looking for goalie. I am striker. Dmitri! Where the hell is he? Not too far. Just to subway. Lose that junk of crap and follow him! Drew said he had signal. I got this guy. Keep a safe distance, but stay on him. Dmitri, you wanna get out of the car? I'm double parked, they will tow. I'm going Brooklyn on this mommy. Hey. Hey, guys. I just gotta... Hey, hey! Don't be putting your hands on me. Get your fucking hands off me! Okay, okay. Relax, you got me. You got me. I'm on him. Stand down. Gloria, he made you. Stand back and wait for me. - I'm right behind him. - He's made you, wait for me. All right, I still have the signal. I'm gonna go to the next station. Connelly, he's right here, we can take him. No, stand back, he made you, wait for me. Oh, shit! Shit. - Drew, you still have the signal? - Yeah, I still got him. The signal's still very strong. Wait a minute, it's gone, I dropped the signal. He's gone. Holden's team found the broker. I can't have you tapping citizens' cell phones. Or your team running around the city resisting arrest. I understand that. I'll keep them clean, I just need a little rope. Maybe another 24 hours, that's all. All right, 24 hours. Thank you very much. Sir. Sir! Doctor! Da. He lived? Just make sure that you get the winning bid. How is he? He just got out of hospital an hour ago. He's one tough son of a bitch, I'll give you that. The triggerman did get away, but the Lieutenant was able to convince our Bulgarian friends here to give us access to all the cellular towers in the country. Drew? Yeah, I got a signal on the broker's phone, as long as he keeps the battery in it, I can track him anywhere. Okay. My new team goes out in five. What? New team? A new team? What are you talking about? This is our mission. Come on, Drew. Back us up, man. - Gentlemen, Holden needs you in office. - This is our mission. Who, whoa, whoa, whoa. Where are you going? Hey, guys. You surprised me. You weren't half bad, considering... Considering what? You know what, this is a good thing. We're all still alive, we can go home. - Drew? Drew? - We can live our lives, we can... Considering what? Considering who you are. Considering, um... Considering how I picked you guys. We know how you picked us. It was the algorithms. You hacked the database, crunched the numbers. We came out on top. Right? I did hack the database. But I was looking for agents who were C-86. C-86? What's that? It's a classification for agents who are, uh, throwaways. Disposable. You brought us here to die? No. I brought you here to fail! I was hoping that if we washed out early, Holden would disband us and I could go back to working alone. I ain't no throwaway! I knew they were sending me on suicide mission! That's why I ran. You guys saw what they tried to do to Holden because of me. None of us are cut out for an assignment like this. Let's be honest, okay? - You son of a bitch. - Gloria... You know, I gave up being taken seriously as an agent a long time ago, then you come along and offer us a real assignment and tell us it was all a joke. You're not a joke. I just wanted to get to know you. Why don't you just go back to playing with your little toys? I'm sorry... The signal's still strong from the inside. Go in, get the broker, and then get out. Yo, man, I got your message, man. What's up? Yeah, we think a black hatter named Teebs has Pantheon. Didn't he speak in Antwerp last year? Yeah. Demonstrated how he could take over a 747 with his iPhone. The guy's a legit psycho. Okay, I need you to pull up whatever surveillance pics you can. All right? Just single him out. I think we got a few of him on stage, but the guy's wearing a mask. He's not dumb. What exactly are you looking for? Uh, I don't know, man. Just pull whatever you can, okay? All right. All right, we're closing in, boys. Signal's red-hot. They're right on top of him. Shit! He's not here, sir. There's definitely somebody been here. Guys, he on the move. Shit! He's right above us. Sir? We've got a mule in here. So get rid of him. The signal's on the mule. It's the broker. Connelly! Connelly, get out of there! Everyone out! I repeat, fall back! Stanford, watch your six! Stanford! Do you read? Stanford! Princeton! Connelly? Princeton, I lost signal. Princeton? Jennifer? Hey, Dan. Miss me? Killed them. That's it? That's what you want? That surprises you? Hey. It's your money, man. Your choice. But if you have a beef with Moscow, I can melt them down. I melt down Moscow and I get what? Nothing but dead brothers and martial law for my enemy. My army will never be big enough to get me back home. But if I have friends, armies in other countries, then, then perhaps I could. Ah, a false flag. Blow up your own place, then blame the bad guys. - Everyone needs a Pearl Harbor. - Okay. I'll make it happen from the airport. Lights go out, you'll know it's on. Just transfer the money to my account and I'll bump it to phase two. I prefer that you stay until it's over. That's not the deal we brokered. Broker is dead. Bes. Take him out. Now, that would be foolish. He pays me twice what you do. How long do you need? Ten minutes. Five. We got the Pentagon on satellite link. Oh, great. Put him on. Hey, Bens. What's up? Hey, Holden, listen to me. I got a hit on your female assassin. Her name is Bettina "Bes" Karpov. She is a human chameleon and a highly valued Russian asset. She was raised in the UK and is currently in the employ of one General Olag Konstantin. He defected from Russia when the Wall fell and is currently in charge of over one-third of Bulgaria's armed forces. He is a staunch opponent of his adopted army being taken over by NATO and the EU. Holden, listen to me. You and your team have got to get to that key before he does. This bastard hates Russia as much as he does Europe. He gets the key, he'll start World War III. Are you ready? This was a Communist retreat for us Generals. Party leaders. Now it's falling apart. Most Russian special forces once came from Bulgaria, did you know that? No, man. I did not know that. This country was Moscow's little brother. Now we are Europe's little sister. It's time to change that. So, yes, I am ready. I've been ready for a long time. Okay. Here we go. It has begun. Backup power's on. It's started. Sir, the landline just went dead. He cut off the cell towers. Come on, get your ass in there and do something. He could be anywhere on the planet right now! We don't find the key, there's nothing I can do. Okay. Hey, how many tactical teams we got available right now? None. Oh, no. He just shut down the water! What can't he shut down? Uh, DOD satellite and GPS. Everything else he owns. Good, good. Hey, I need a DOD phone. We've got a DOD link right here. - I need that. - Here. Who's got it? Yo? I need you to tell me everything you have on Teebs, okay? Dude, we got a boatload of photos of him from the black hat presentation, but like I said, he's got on a mask and glasses. All right. Well, describe him to me. Okay? Everything that you see. Dude, he's exactly what you would expect. Typical sideways hat wearing, neckbeard. Vaping through some creepy skull bandanna. Looks like the devil when he exhales. Vape? Wait! Vaping? Stop. Like an electronic cigarette? No. It's like a little metal pipe. Like a vape pen? Yeah, yeah, something like that. All right, describe the vape pen. Man, I don't smoke. What does this have to do with anything? Just keep describing it! What color is it? Silver, about the size of a cigar. It's got like a, uh, clown on... No, it's a skull. It's got a skull on the front. Is the tip metal or plastic? Plastic. What are you talking about? Teebs uses the skull head model of an EK-928-C vaporizer. Okay? The only way you can charge that thing is with a USB port. Chinese manufacturers put a back-door in everything. So, I guarantee you that every time he charges that son of a bitch, they track his location. I just need to get into their mainframe. I'm in. Tell me you got him. Who handles your GPS locations? - Nadine? Nadine? - Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Look at these numbers, just tell me any numbers that have the same longitude and latitude. Yeah. It's this one, this one and that one. Okay, that's three. All right. That's a bakery in Odessa. An apartment in Sumy. And a power plant in Sofia. I got him! I got him! I got two teams flying in from Germany right now. I don't need your teams, man. I have a team right here, ready to go. So, you picked us to fail. But now you want us to volunteer for a suicide mission? There are no terms under which I want to die. Yeah, no thanks. Bring in the A-Team. Listen, I made a mistake. Okay? I made a mistake! I'm sorry, I... I don't have a lot of experience dealing with... - People? - Yes. That, yes. I misjudged you. Okay? Gloria, I looked at your records. And despite a negative psych eval that says you're cold and heartless, your field tests and your combat evals were off the charts. You were the top of your class. Okay? And just because you have this beautiful face, this pencil-pushing asshole decided that you should be a swallow. And that's awful. But this is your decision, this one. Not some chauvinist in a suit. So, come on. Okay. - But I still hate you. - That's fair. I'll work on that. Fish, you're a goddamn cyclone of death and destruction. Yeah. Well... But you've been forced to conform. But if we can harness that insanity, and then unleash it at the right moment, there's not an army on the planet that can stand up to you. Fine. I'm in, too. It's only because I can't walk away from a fight. Dmitri, listen to me. Listen to me, you son of a bitch. Most people would disagree with what I'm about to say, people in this very room. But I'm gonna tell you right now, you're the best damn wheelman in Europe. Well... You're the only person I trust to get us in and out of there. No. No. No. I see what you are doing. It won't work. You people are crazy. Konstantin has an army. We are four people. We are five people. I guess you guys need someone like me to figure out a way to get you idiots in and out of there alive. Great. So, in addition to me, Russian special forces, we have nerd, a Mata Hari, a mental patient and old man. And you're the Russian agent that speaks Russian? - Yes. - Wow. Where are your sneakers? Why? Well, I heard you run a lot. He runs a lot. Uh... How'd you like the old man's boot up your ass? Huh? I will at least drop you off. Hey. Hey. I thought you might need this. Thanks. You know how to use it, right? Yeah. Yeah, I know. Put it away. Fisher. I got you gift. It's in the trunk. That's messed up because I didn't get you nothing. It's okay. An offer of peace and friendship, since we will most probably not survive mission. What is this? Some kind of jinx shit? That's bad mojo, man, no way. You slam the trunk, you damage the paint. You mean damage the rust. No presents before missions, especially when you say you're giving it to me 'cause we might die. This present is lucky. You will want this present. Keep the stupid present. I'll take it after the mission. Yo, this is some wimp shit right here. Why are we going in the back? Because Konstantin has a small army out front, and I can't hack armored vehicles and AK-47s. What are we even looking at, anyway? The cooling outlet for the gas turbines. It's the least guarded entrance. Well, someone's gotta at least take out the guys guarding it. All right. Go ahead. Get it out of your system. Uh, hey, Fisher, um... First of all, how's it going? Good. I'm gonna tell you something that you're probably not gonna like very much. I stole a peek at your personnel files. And you are not the best shot in the group. No, no, not me. Her. - You're kidding? - No, I'm not. Sorry. She might be good, but is she fast? There's two guys. She hits one, she's gotta hit the other before he sounds the alarm. Holy... That was hot. I know. Okay. I have a signal. Pantheon is here, but it looks like there's miles of tunnels under this thing. Listen. There's a door. All right. Let me take care of this chump. Hey, Fisher! Calm down, man. Not yet. All right? Listen for once. Just be patient. Use your head. How the hell do we get in? You're in uniform. Dmitri? Come on, let's go! The next guy's mine. All right. These guys right here, let's do 'em. Calm down, Fisher. Just wait. All right, let's split up. Grid search. Drew, Gloria, mid-level. Fisher, Dmitri, basement. How come I get the basement? There's probably less people for you to kill down there. This is bullshit. I gotta at least get me one guy. Hey. This panel's ancient. Old Soviet technology. I bet I can hack into the control room from here. Holy... - Holden? - Drew, what did you find? Teebs had Pantheon reroute all the gas into the city. It's gonna overload the system. The pipes are gonna burst, the city's gonna... The city's gonna blow up. If they can blow up this city, they can blow up anything, anywhere. We gotta find that key. Hey, man. Someone just hacked into your mainframe. There's only one way to do that. - Which is? - Be in the building. He's lying- - I'm not the one who lies. - Keep an eye on him. So, are you playing the General, too? Or was it just me? No. Just you. Hey. What's that say, right there? You can't read this? Knife. Fork. It says this way to food place. Hells yeah! That means there's gonna be a shit ton of guys in there. Let me go in first and spray 'em. Hey! We have uniform. I speak okay Bulgarian, you don't have to shoot, huh? Come on, man. We're in the basement. No one's gonna hear us. He's mad. Come on, man! Let's go! Damn it! All right. We're going to the cafeteria. If anyone's hungry, speak up. Quit the humor, will you? Take it nice and easy. No mistakes. Hey, yeah, I know, a stealth mission. You suck the fun out of everything. It's empty. Shh! Cigarette's still burning. Those scum-sucking pigs are here somewhere. That is just plain weird. It's like everyone just up and left. Well, there's plenty down here, Fisher, so stay off the com. Yeah, man. Calm down. Don't kill anyone. Guys, it's like something's going on down here. Like everyone just disappeared all of a sudden. Go. It's kind of spooky down here in the dungeon. I should have had to kill at least one guy to be at this point. What the hell? Fisher, I just told you. Cut the chatter will you? Okay, looks like a zombie movie down here. There's half-eaten meals, warm coffee. It's as creepy as shit. Just keep your finger off the trigger so you don't blow your balls off. Why does everyone keep saying that to me? I'm a trained professional, not an animal. Was that you Fisher? What the hell was that? Good news, I got my 20. And there's cake. - What did he just say? - I don't know, something about 20 cakes? - What did he just say? - I don't know, something about 20 cakes? Dmitri! Security breach, sub level, B6. I told you. Security breach, sub level, B6. Guys, I got bad news. Igor pulled the alarm. Who the hell is Igor? The birthday boy. Let's get out of here! System malfunction. Pressure critical. Twelve minutes to valve failure. Teebs! It's him, he's got the key. - Go, I'll keep him busy. - Just be safe okay? Teebs, stop. You don't have to do this, man. You're not a killer, okay, you're a hacker. Just give me the key. We can stop this. I'm a god with this. You think I'm going to hand it over? Please? - You're going to shoot me? - Back up, man. Um... What happened? The key, it's destroyed. Well, clear the hell out of there, will you? Now! Just get out. Holden, we can't clear out. - Drew. - Sir, we're losing them. No, we can't get out, we have to shut it down! - Drew, I can't hear you. - Holden! - Holden! - Sir, the signal dropped. All right, get the RSO in here, will you? I lost him, are you guys still there? You heard the order, let's get out of here. No, we can't just leave, we have to shut it down. You said we can't without the key. We can't, but if I can get into the control room maybe we can hack the hardware. I don't hack, I blow shit up. Okay, well, you guys create a diversion. Gloria and I will get to the control room. Roger that. Ten minutes to valve failure. It's going to get hairy. No pussing out. I ain't pussing out, okay? Look, I need to know you got my back. Yeah, well, why are you climbing? I don't like heights. I thought you weren't going to puss out. Yeah, I ain't no puss. Set up a perimeter. I want these men caught. They are dressed in our uniforms but I can ID them. Hey, yo! Check this out. That's them! That's them! Heads up. Eight minutes to valve failure. It's an old control room. Analog, not digital, not my specialty. Okay. Okay. Okay, Pantheon is going to push as much gas as possible into the city using pipe 718 here. There's nothing we can do to change that, but I might be able to spoof the hardware by swapping out the server control head ID's. Right, what does that mean in English? We need to hot-wire it. Okay. What can I do to help? Okay, so, we need to find as many CAT 5 cables as possible. Connect that panel over there with this control board into that computer. Great. What's a CAT 5 cable? Close in. Get them! Shit, I'm out of grenades. Dmitri! Dmitri, get back here. Commie bastard. Hey, heads up. Thank you. So, theoretically, this should work. Theoretically? In theory. You say "theoretically" now. So, how much longer is this going to take? Well, I just need to reset the router, but that takes time. Hey, Drew, that crazy Russian broad just got by me. She's kind of hot. Uh, uh... Let me go say hello. Six minutes to valve failure. That commie deserted us. How much longer, Drew? I'm running out of ammo. Just a few minutes, keep up the distraction. Turn around! Go ahead. Just do it. Drew, are you almost done? - Damn it. - I'll take that as a no. It needs a firmware update. This is going to take two minutes. Doesn't this place blow up in a few minutes? Drew, be careful', I lost her. I think she went outside. I thought you left me, man. I had to get you present. - What, that's for me? - Bazooka time. I didn't know Russians made bazookas. We invented the bazooka. There they are! Turn left! Around the corner! Take cover! Give me the shell. It is Russian, more difficult to fire. I will shoot... No, no, bullshit, man. This is my present. You already got one. Aiming this can be a little tricky. Don't tell me about aim. I was this close to being special forces. - Come on. - Big deal. Attack! They are going to shoot! Bazooka time. Okay, that went a little wide. You destroyed her. Well, I'm sorry, man, collateral damage. Just get me another shell. Shells are in trunk. You left the shells in the trunk? What the... Because you didn't want present. Now is our chance... turn the gun! I don't care anymore, car is dead. Stop, stop, come here. Look, if we're going to do this, we gotta be smart, we gotta use our heads. I've got a plan. Follow me, come on, come on. They're getting away! Drew, I'm not sure how much longer I can hold her off. All right, I'm going to try something, hang on. Uh... Sorry, sorry, that was the wrong wire, obviously. It's got to be this guy right here. What happened? That wasn't it. Drew, are we going to blow up? 'Cause I'd kind of like to know. There's really only one more of these. Come on, Drew. Yeah, I'm almost there. Two minutes to valve failure. You killed my car... prepare to die! Shoot... shoot now! Fisher! In the grass stop... stop! Shalom, motherfucker. Fisher! I got me a tank! Fifteen seconds to valve failure. Ten seconds to valve failure. Five seconds to valve failure. We did it. It worked. Hey, hey, what happened? I just cut my thumb. - Hey. - Hey. Hey, Fisher, on com earlier, you said something about cake, didn't you?
