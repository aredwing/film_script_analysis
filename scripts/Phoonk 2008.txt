Times are not about long runs, Anshuman. A given day's work should be completed the same very day. l knew Rajeev would say that. Rajeev, first, let me and Madhu have a word with Srinivas. Go ahead. Talk. But work shouldn't stop and l trust you for that. Sir, the workers have found a stone.. ..while digging at the site. A part of the stone resembles a Ganesha idol, sir. What?! - Yes, yes, Rajeev. - So? The workers wish to build a small shrine at that place. What's wrong with you, Shyam? How do you get such matters to me! Tell the workers that whoever wishes to can take the stone home. And l won't change my foundation plans for.. ..such stupid superstitions. Do you understand? Oh yes.. l forgot to ask you! lt was your wedding anniversary yesterday, right? Yes. - Belated wishes, pal! So, what did the two of you do yesterday? Well.. we were repenting the fact that we got married! Leave him or his ears will tear! Rajeev. - Yes. lt'd take me six more months to repay the loan l've taken from you. Anshuman, l've already told you, it isn't a loan. Forget it, don't feel embarrassed. What's this? Yes, Vinay, tell me! Guess what! - Don't tell me. We bagged the Delhi lT park contract? Yes. - That's good news! Thank you so much. l'll call you later. Shyam?! - Yes sir! We've got the Delhi contract! - Congratulations, sir! Anshuman, l'll leave. Right! Thank you. Hey, give me the keys. Sit. Hello? Hello, madam, madam, l am Shyam speaking. On the site.. Aarti! - Hi! - Guess what? What happened? - Guess what.. - What? We've bagged the contract for Delhi's lT park. Really? - Yes. Rajeev. - Yes. - l'm so happy. Everything's going great, isn't it? - Yes. Lets hold a prayer service next week in our house. As you wish. But don't make me sit through it. But Rajeev, if God's blessings bring in happiness and good fortune.. ..then why not? Correct! l slog, l make the effort.. ..and every time, the credit goes to.. your God! Great, isn't it? Rajeev! Listen. The Ganesh idol at the site.. - Oh great! So the news has reached you too! Rajeev, if all the workers wish for a small shrine there.. ..then get one built. Aarti.. - Do you know? l've seen something similar at Ganpatipule. People believe in the powers of that idol. They venerate it. Do l interfere when you pray or hold rituals at home? No, isn't it? Then please do not involve your God in my work. l'm happy without Him. But Rajeev l was just.. l think.. Cut it out. Better that way. Listen, can l have a cup of tea? Get it. Smile now. You look. l'll just get it. Laxmi, go get the kids. Yes madam. ''Small joys.. ..fly like butterflies.'' ''Along the walls..'' Hey Rohan! - Bye! You soiled your uniform again today? - What do l do? lt was raining, the playground was full of slush. You soil your uniform everyday! lt's me who has to do the washing! Not you! The washing machine! Sister, how do people sit in the plane if it's so small! Dumbo! lt isn't small, it looks so. lf it's not small then why does it look so? lts far off that's why. You mean if it comes closer, it would get bigger? Double dumbo! lt won't get bigger, it is big! lf it's big then why does it look small? ''Small joys.. ..fly like butterflies..'' - Hi Mani! C'mon, bravo! So what did you do in school today? l drew Spiderman in the drawing test! Spiderman?! A Sardar Spiderman, Papa! - Sardar Spiderman?! Yes! With turban and a beard! Papa! - Yes. l'm enacting the role of Helen of Troy in a play at school. Wow! - Mary ma'am has selected me! That's good! That's good! Who's Helen? - What, grandma! You do not even know about Helen of Troy?! Raksha, there are a lot of things.. ..that your grandma knows and you don't, okay! Don't make fun. Right? Papa, let's go out today.. - Yes, of course. First you bathe, change your clothes.. ..and finish your homework. And then we'll go. C'mon. Let's go! - Be careful! Raksha, careful! Rajeev. - Yes, mom. Switch on the TV.. let's see what's being aired.. ..on Aastha channel. The base of spiritual preaching is that.. ..one must accept everyone as his own. Lord hanuman is the God of powers. ln the olden days, there used to be a.. ..Lord Hanuman temple outside every fort. When Lord Hanuman went in search of Mother Sita.. ..no demon was able to stop him. Sister Laxmi venerates Lord Hanuman everyday too. What will she do with his powers? You will always remain naughty! When Lord Hanuman was your age, he was naughty too. Very vile! Vile? Papa, grandma was telling us about demons. Grandma, are the demons afraid of the Gods? What are you telling them, mom? Just that.. how would one realize the power of God.. ..unless there are demons. C'mon! Go to sleep! C'mon! C'mon! C'mon! Good night, grandma. You too go to sleep. O' Lord Ram. O' Lord Ram. Rohan! Raksha! Do not run! You'll fall down! Yes, l've allotted the work to Anshuman and Madhu. l think they'll handle it. Rajeev, l find Anshuman and Madhu a little weird. Why? - Especially Madhu. Her mannerisms.. l find her insane! Yes! - No, pal. lnitially l used to think the same. But she's quite smart. And you cannot judge people.. ..according to their mannerisms or behaviour. No, friend. Yes.. she looks a little insane and childish.. ..but as far as the work's concerned, she's good. She's good but she's completely mad! l trust them for their work and l trust them completely. Whatever! Raksha! - Raksha.. - What happened? Raksha! - Raksha! Get up! What happened? Did you get hurt? No, papa, just a little.. Why don't you listen to what mamma says! Papa she beat me first. Go inside! Else you'll get a beating from me too. Mamma.. Rajeev, at least think before yelling at them. You.. are hurt? You are alright? lt's my mistake. l incited Rohan. l'm sorry. Rajeev loves his daughter a lot, doesn't he? Are you alright? Come. Oh, when did you people come? - Just now. Come, sit. You are okay, right? Come.. come.. Hello, yes, yes, tell me. Rajeev, we had a word with Srinivas. He has agreed. Okay, but keep him under control. There's no need to worry. This time, we have him fully under control. And Rajeev, you should worry when there's a problem. Not when there is no problem at all. Okay. Raksha, did you read the books that l had sent? No! Those books are meant for kids. You have grown up but you still sit in your dad's lap. My wish! What have you got to do with it? Raksha, is this the way to talk to elders? Papa, l don't like her. - Raksha! How sweet. Go inside.. Go. Sorry Madhu, she's just a kid. She's a kid. By the way, l've organized a party tomorrow night. On the occasion of getting the contract! Cheers! Lovely! This is called climbing the ladder of success in style! And while climbing the ladder of success.. ..one should keep an eye to see that no one else is going up the lift! Right? Relax. Relax. l think you would need a drink too. - Yes. Okay. Raksha, why are you standing there? Come here. Come here, dear. She doesn't like me. - What? But l love her. Sweet. Hey! You're late! l want to talk to you. What happened? Come inside, please come. Cheers! - Cheers. No.. you got.. Rajeev?! - Such a big fraud! Rajeev, what.. what happened? Why. How dare you! How dare you! Fraud? What kind of a fraud? l .. l .. What is all this? What is all this? Rajeev, let me explain. The thing is.. What do you want to explain?! Why.. why.. why did you beat him? Don't utter a word. Don't you dare utter a word! Rajeev! - You too sided with him and.. l considered you two.. so close.. go away! Rajeev, what happened?! - Why did.. why did you beat him? Rajeev! - Ask him! Ask! Leave him! lf you had asked, l would have given you alms just like this! l trusted you and you are cheating me. l'll not spare you! - Listen to me, Rajeev. Rajeev! - Rajeev! What are you doing? C'mon! Rajeev! - Leave me! Keep quiet! - Rajeev! - Leave me! l want a notice out in the newspapers tomorrow. Now they have nothing to do with our company! We are not responsible if these two deal with anybody on our behalf. And l want this first thing in the morning! First thing in the morning! - Yes sir. Okay, sir. Next time they come near my office, just kick them out! Kick them out.. What? What? What? What? - Rajeev! What are you staring at? What are you staring at? - Rajeev! Rajeev. - What are you staring at? Lower your eyes! Lower your eyes! - Rajeev! - Lower your eyes! Rajeev! - Staring at me! Look down! Rajeev, listen. - Take him out! Not ashamed of doing it! Lower your eyes! Leave. Leave. Anshuman, take her away. Madhu, let's go from here. Get out! Get out! Let's go from here. Let's go. Anshuman, take Madhu away! Come, let's go, Madhu. Rajeev, what's the matter? Just get out of here. Get out! A witch she is! Get out of my house! Lower your eyes! Lower your eyes! Out! - Okay, okay. Ask them.. ask them to get out now! l want them out of my compound now! - Okay, Rajeev, okay. Sir. One minute! This is the company's car, not yours. Get out and go walking! C'mon, out! Go! Rajeev, l've never seen you getting angry like this before. Mom, l do not wish to talk about this! You.. You go and sleep. Let it be now.. Rajeev, it's good they got caught now itself. The loss could have been more. We haven't lost the money, we've lost the trust. No. We won't kill him. We won't kill him. We will make him suffer. He loves his daughter a lot, right? Ram! Ram! Ram! Ram! Ram! Ram! Vinay, what about Anshuman and Madhu's replacements? l've shortlisted a candidate. He's coming to meet you tomorrow. Shyam. - Sir. l'd like to meet those newly appointed contractors. Sure sir. Sir.. - What? Sir, l had told you about the workers.. ..wishing to build a shrine.. You are still stuck with the same thing? The workers will keep making such demands.. ..and are you going to accept whatever they say? No sir, their religious sentiments.. What religious sentiments? Stop it! We are here to construct a building and not a shrine! Don't bring this matter to me again, okay? - 'Yes sir.' Rajeev, it's just a small issue. Get a shrine made. What's the harm? lt will just take half a day. The workers would be happy too. Don't tell me that you too believe in such things? Hey, who said l believe? But when it doesn't harm us then why not believe it? Yes, Aarti, tell me. Rajeev, l don't know where Raksha has gone missing! l searched the whole house but she's not to be found. What?! You come soon. l .. l'm coming. Sit! What happened? Rajeev, Raksha is not to be found anywhere. We searched the whole house. Call her friend! - l did! She's not there. Rajeev, you go and search for her. Did you look there? Raksha! Raksha! Raksha.. Raksha. How did you get here? Are you okay? Come, let's go home. What are you looking at? Careful! How did you go there?! Tell me! Don't be quiet! l'm asking.. l'm asking you something! - Rajeev, leave her. Rajeev. - What does this girl think! 'Rajeev, do not be angry. Be calm and talk.' What be calm and talk? 'lt's my fault! l've pampered her!' You ask her. Ask. - Rajeev. Sorry. l am sorry too, dad. - Come here. l really do not know how l got there. lt's alright, Raksha, it's alright. Smile now.. Mandar. - l think you are absolutely right for the position. Thank you so much, Mr. Rajeev Rajeev. Just Rajeev. - Yes, Rajeev. - Cool. C'mon! Mandar, l had an unpleasant experience with the guy.. ..working here before you. You'll come to know about it in due course. - Sure. You are joining from the day after, right? - Yes, that's right. Great! l'll see you then. - lt was a pleasure meeting you. Same here. Carry on. The agreement's been signed! - So? Everything's okay? Shinde is a government man. These guys need to be bribed. He was asking for five. l settled it for three. Five or three. What's the big deal? The work's done, right? That's what matters. Should l order something? A cold drink or.. tea? Get me a cup of tea. Sir, the contractors.. - Yes. All three are good.. Give them the extension letter. - Okay sir. Sir, l shouldn't say it.. But the workers are adamant about the shrine. l tried explaining but.. You and these workers.. don't you understand? l'm not going to relent by them being adamant! Lay off all the workers right now! And that.. Who's that.. Kalyan! Employ his labour team! Go now! Go! Where's the tea? - C'mon Rajeev. You don't need to take such a serious step. This has been an age old conflict.. ..between believers and the non-believers. And between the two are over smart guys like you Who are bent on either side, right? lt's safe! - What safe? See, l'm one of those who take advantage of the beliefs.. ..related to religion. And anyway Hindu religion permits us.. No matter how many sins you commit.. ..apologize for them once before dying. That's it! Everything's forgiven! And whenever such problems crop up.. As long as my time and energy aren't wasted, l mould myself accordingly Simple! You know something? You are worse than them. l know. But l am me. - Yes, you are you! What? - Rajeev! Where's the tea? Aarti? Raksha? Laxmi.. Laxmi.. Rajeev! What happened? Are you alright? What happened? Rajeev, did you have a nightmare? lt's okay. Go to sleep. Madam! 'Madam!' 'Madam!' What is this? - Sir.. unlucky.. l don't know, sir. Mani, what is this? - l don't know, sir. How did this come into the compound? Papa, some dog must have brought it. - Or some crow. Dumbo! A crow cannot carry such weight. Laxmi, throw all of this outside. No sir, l can't touch it. - What? Mani! - Yes! - You.. Sir, that.. me.. - What, me, me! Rajeev! But how did the lemons and the bones.. ..come into your compound? - l don't know. What do you mean? - l don't know! Actually, l don't care! Then.. - What then? l picked up all of that and threw it out of the compound, that's it. End of the matter. Sister, why was Laxmi so afraid.. ..seeing the lemons in the compound? Laxmi is afraid of everyone! By the way what's so special about this stupid lemon?! Lemon juice! Rajeev. - Yes. What happened? Rajeev, mom is very worried about.. ..those lemons and the bones found in the compound. She.. - Give me a break. - But.. Dad l can hear some voices. - What? What kind of voices? - l don't know. Someone has cut my hair too. - What? Cut your hair? Your hair is the way it was earlier. No, dad. You do not observe my hair everyday! Raksha, this is your imagination. Your hair is just the way it was earlier. Come. Come, l'll put you to sleep. Ok. Come. Did Shersingh go to sleep? First, you stop listening to grandma's stories, okay? Shersingh has gone to sleep. Now you too go to sleep. Good night. Vinay.. what's happening? Rajeev.. Mandar.. - Mandar? Who? The one you had appointed in place of Anshuman and Madhu.. Yes, so? - He was surveying the site.. l don't know how but when the stones were being dumped.. ..he got crushed under them and died. Come again! - Rajeev, Mandar is dead. He is dead, Rajeev! ..29,30! Sister! Sister! Sister! Sister! Sister! Sister! Sister! Sister! Raksha, come inside now. l am sorry! Bye Raksha! - Bye. Sit down. What's wrong with you? Why are you laughing? Where's everyone? Upstairs. Aarti what.. What happened? - ln a manly voice.. l didn't understand. l don't understand anything either! Dad, what has happened to sister? Nothing, she's just a bit unwell. Which class do you study in? - Fifth. - Fifth class. Look here a little.. Very nice. Very nice. Okay. What were you doing in your class yesterday? l had a test yesterday. - You had a test?! What was the test about? - Math. You didn't do well. - l did well. - You did well? Get up for a while. Stand up. Very good. Go a little back. A little back. Yes. Look here. Now look here. Good. Rajeev, as far as my tests are concerned.. ..she's perfectly fine. Good that she's fine, doctor. But.. what happened at the school.. ..what was that? Don't take me otherwise, Rajeev. l think your daughter wasn't prepared.. ..for the class test. That's why.. She was just pretending. Pretending? That's not possible doctor. Raksha is a very bright student. ln fact, she stood third in her class last year. l too stood first in the seventh grade.. ..and then in the eight grade, l stood twenty first. This happens with children.. ..but parents don't seem to accept this. They keep on changing. Doctor, l think.. l know my daughter. - Yes. Raksha.. Doing this.. - lt's.. lt's just not possible. See.. children behave in a particular manner at home.. ..and in an altogether different manner, once outside. But then doctor, what about her laughter.. ..in a manly voice? Look, firstly, Raksha laughing in a manly voice is abnormal.. ..and l don't disagree to this. And because she kept laughing for such long time.. ..as you say then maybe she had some throat trouble.. Maybe some sore throat.. ..her vocal chords were pressurized.. You know when one has sore throat.. ..one's voice changes. And it's possible after hearing such voice, everyone thought.. ..that she was laughing in a manly voice. But anyway, what's the problem? She's absolutely fine now. Papa. What's happening to me? Nothing, why? What was the doctor saying? The doctor said that you are perfectly alright. You're fine. - No papa. l'm not fine. Something's wrong with me. - No, dear, you're fine! Nothing has happened to you, Raksha. Really. Raksha, go and rest upstairs. Go. What happened? What did the doctor say? She's perfectly alright. She'll be alright. She's okay. Tell that doctor to get himself cured first! Someone has performed black magic on Raksha. Yes! What? - Yes, Rajeev. Do not be blind! There's something. That day, Raksha suddenly disappeared.. And then the lemon and bones were found in our compound.. And then.. all of this at the school! What can it be other than black magic! Mom, stop watching those baseless programs.. ..on the TV! O' God! Hail Lord Brahma! Hail Lord Vishnu! Hail lord Shiva! Hail Guru! Hail Lord! Ram! Ram! Ram! Ram! Ram! Ram! Hail Lord! Mother! Mother! Mother! You're the one doing all this, right? No.. no. - You are doing this. - No. Laxmi. - Yes madam. - Serve the breakfast. - Okay. Papa! Papa! Papa! Papa! Papa! Papa! Sister.. What happened? What happened to your sister? Rajeev! - Raksha! - Rajeev! What happened? Baba black sheep.. ..have you any wool! Yes sir, three bags full! One for my master. - Raksha.. - One for my dame. One for my.. One for the little boy who stays down the lane! Baba black sheep.. ..have you any wool! Yes! Raksha.. What happened, Rajeev? - Come with me. What happened? Tell me. Come.. see for yourself. ls everything alright? - Come. Baba black sheep, have you any wool! Yes sir, yes sir, three bags full! One for my master and one for my dame! One for my little boy who stays down the lane! One for my.. Raksha. Raksha. Raksha. Doctor.. l know a doctor.. Doctor Seema Walke. She's a psychiatrist. l think we should call her immediately. Raksha. Raksha. l'm not Raksha! You aren't Raksha? - No! Doctor.. Then who are you? Who are you? Who are you? Where is Raksha? Where is she? With me. Can l talk to her? - No. Why? Why? Why? Dear? - Raksha! lt's ok. - Dad! What's the problem, doctor? What do you mean by what's the problem?! Can't you all see that she is possessed by an evil spirit?! Please do not believe in such superstitions. l do not believe it blindly! You all have gone blind! Each individual has his own emotions.. ..and has his own thoughts. That is what makes each individual who they are. Like your thoughts and views differ from mine. That is what makes your identity. ln Raksha's case.. lts what we call a case of.. ..dissociated personality disorder. ln such cases, the thinking power, thoughts.. ..or emotions get divided.. and.. ..are compartmentalized in different parts of the same brain. And we think these people have different personalities. Because their mannerisms, behaviour.. ..as well as the manner of speech changes suddenly. ln most cases, this happens when one goes through.. ..a mental conflict or stress. But l believe the cause of.. ..all this is the evil spirit that's possessed Raksha! Yes, it is. lf you want to call mental conflicts.. ..which are a result of past experiences or.. ..some old conversations which have.. ..happened in the past as evil spirits then surely call them so. But they aren't so in reality, they exist only in the mind. But they are evil spirits after all, right? - Dad, save me! Dad, save me! Dad! Dad, please! Raksha, what happened? - Dad, its hurting a lot! What happened? What happened? Dad.. someone.. - What? - Dad.. - What? Doctor, please do something! - Dad, save me! Dad! Dad! Dad, someone's twisting my hand! Just get me that injection please. - Dad, dad! Dad, my hand's paining! Dad! Please doctor, help. Dad.. my hand's paining a lot, dad! Doctor! - Please help me dad! Doctor! What's happening, doctor? Dad! - Raksha! Dad! Dad! Dad! Dad! - Raksha. - Dad! Dad! Dad! Dad! The effect of sedative will remain for some hours. After that she will be alright. You don't worry. As the treatment continues, it will be alright. Doctor Pandey, l need to conduct some tests. We need to take her to the hospital for that. Tests won't achieve anything! What all will you test! Can't you see how she's struggling! This.. this definitely is black magic. lt's common in black magic that a doll is made.. ..of using a cloth and her hand is twisted.. ..after chanting some mantras. When will you people understand? When will you all understand? Excuse me. Excuse me. l know, Rajeev, that you do not believe all this. But l believe in God. l believe with true conviction. lf God exists then so does evil. Certainly. But today, if my child is suffering because of that evil power. Then what is God doing?! Why isn't he doing anything? Why is He not helping us.. ..in spite of my years of devotion? At least some help? My Raksha is still a kid.. She's so small. And all this happening with her.. You are silent! Just silent! Aarti! Aarti! God puts us to the test from time to time. Birth and death are the laws of the nature. But when something goes against the law of nature.. ..then one starts to fear. We keep questioning God out of helplessness. Sparking life into us humans is like just a brief force of wind for you. Then what kind of a force is this.. ..that is driving away the life out of a girl. ''The volcanoes like this.. ..break the heart.'' ''The pain which breaks down.. ..everyone.'' ''Everyone is asking.. ..the shivering hopes.'' ''Silent ice like gaze.. ..keeps shivering.'' ''At slight movement.. ..the mind starts wandering.'' ''What is the reason of the fright.. ..no one can understand.'' ''There is a hope of the dawn.'' ''As if the breaths.. ..have the feeling.. ..of death.'' All the tests are normal. lt's good that there's no major problem in the brain. So clearly, it is a case of.. ..a psychological dissociated disorder. ln such cases, a hurtful memory of some old accident.. ..is hidden in the unconscious mind. And when it gets mobilized and emerges then suddenly.. ..the behaviour of a person changes drastically. lt's almost like he is being possessed by some evil spirit. l think in Raksha's case, her grandma's superstitions.. Her.. l hope you don't mind my saying this.. Her superstitious fantasy stories.. ..have had a lot of effect on Raksha. And to top it all, the sudden appearance of.. ..the lemons and the bones in your house.. Her fear that someone has cut her hair. All these things together have affected her gravely. She has gone through a very deep psychological trauma. Will she be fine, doctor? What l need to do now is.. l need some time to resolve her mental conflict. Don't worry. Don't worry about it. Such treatment takes time, Aarti. Be patient and.. have faith. She'll be fine. She'll be fine. You know that. Nothing will happen to her. Hail Goddess Kali! Hail Goddess Kali! Dad, dad! Sit properly! Raksha! Raksha! Raksha! Raksha! Raksha! - What is all this! This is Baba Devappa. He is the only one who can help! Get up! Get up! Get out, Get out! - There is an evil spirit in this house. Whom have you brought here! - Don't beat him, Rajeev! You keep quiet! - What's all this happening?! Your daughter will die! - Leave! - What are you doing? Get out! Come! Get out! Try to understand! - Get out! - Please try to understand! Out! Get out! - Your daughter will die! Get out! - Listen! - Get out! God will punish you! You don't know what you are doing! Get out! Are you an idiot! - Go! Rajeev! Raksha! Baba, save! Save! What's happening to my.. - Raksha! Raksha! Raksha! Raksha! What happened to my daughter! O' God! O' God! What's happening here! - Have mercy on her. Dad! - What's happening to her? Somebody's hitting me, dad! Dad! - Raksha! What happened, Raksha? What happened? Somebody's hitting me! - What happened, Rajeev?! What's happening to her? - l don't know? - Dad! What happened, Raksha?! Leave me! Leave me! Raksha! - Raksha! - Leave me! Leave! - Raksha! What's happening to you, Raksha?! What's happening, Raksha! - Leave! Get the car out! Tell Mani to get the car! - Leave me! Leave! Leave! Leave! - Raksha! Raksha! - Leave! Raksha! Leave me! Leave me! 'Leave me!' Leave! Leave! Leave! Raksha! Leave! Look Rajeev, l know that you do not believe.. ..in God or the supernatural. But Rajeev.. all of this.. We aren't having a drawing room discussion here! Okay, the faith you have in these doctors, science.. ..technology.. ln spite of these doctors being so well educated, if they are not able.. ..to find a solution then shouldn't we.. ..look for some other alternative, Rajeev? Look at Raksha! Look at how she is suffering. Rajeev, some person who could do something about Raksha's plight.. Who ? Who? - Manja. l've enquired. Rajeev, please. You kill her. You kill her! lt's better to kill her than let her live in this state. Nothing will come out of these tests or treatments. Doctor, someone has cast.. ..a black magic spell on Raksha. Black magic! And no one can do anything about it! Not even God! l can understand your predicament.. But you must understand! Raksha has a psychological problem. Yes, it's a psychological problem. And so it doesn't reflect.. On any of the tests But it doesn't mean that we start believing.. ..in superstitions like black magic! No! lf we start believing in such things then.. Then we are no less than primitives, Aarti! We have found out scientific solutions to everything.. ..and come out of the primitive age stage by stage And it is with this very thinking that we can move forward. Think.. Think.. Problems that medical science.. ..didn't have answers to ten years back.. ..it has now, isn't it? Similarly, problems to which we don't have answers to.. ..today, we will have them in the near future. l have full faith in it! We have to believe in the scientific way! Not in superstitions! Have faith. Have faith in me. Raksha will surely be alright. Just.. Just believe in me. Alright? Believe in me. Your child is in distress. Your daughter. How did you know? - Don't ask useless questions! You are an atheist? - Yes. - Why? - l don't know. l don't know what God is. What do you do when you have fever? l take crocin (tablet). What does that tablet contain? - l don't know. Without knowing what it contains, you have it.. ..thinking it will take care of the fever You agree to whatever your mom-dad or the doctors say. Then what's the difference between.. ..believing in an ordinary tablet and God? Do you have an answer? Not all things have an explanation. Where is your daughter? At the hospital. Rajeev, who is he? And what is he doing here? Black magic.. without a doubt! - What nonsense is this! lt is beyond your understanding! Who is he? Who is he? Rajeev, you.. of all people! You've brought him here? We don't have much time. Take me to your house. Take you home? Ok, come. This man.. black magic.. l didn't listen to you, mom. Your daughter.. is going to die. What?! What are you saying?! What are you saying?! There's someone who wants revenge against you. - Who? What's he saying? - And they are two people! A man and a woman. Anshuman and Madhu! - And someone is helping them.. Someone working closely with you. Sir.. sir, please sir. l am.. Shyam, the shrine which the workers wanted to be built.. ..at the site.. Build it. Stop it right now or else l'll kill you. l don't need either black magic or God to kill you. Stop it right now! Stop it right now! Rajeev, this.. - Aarti.. Dad, you are hurt? - lt's nothing. Come here! Rajeev, if Raksha is safe with us today.. ..it's only because of Dr. Seema. Thank you. lt's ok! Yes! Yes!
