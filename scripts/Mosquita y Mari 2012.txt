Again... It's Tuesday. Everyday's a Friday for her. You know what? That's not cool. Is that my lipgloss? It'd better not be my lipgloss. Mom gave it to me... Mom gave it to me. How many times do I have to tell you! It's mine! Stop lying, it's mine! I don't want you going through my stuff. Good day, Don Pedro! Dona Herlinda! (Dona Herlinda) Both. He's looking. Hey! Hey! Damn it. Olivia! Olivia! (Students chattering) I was just talking about alternate angles. Interior, exterior. Ok? They're all congruent. Mr. G! I'll be right with you. We're going to go over it. Mr. G! It looks great, Yolanda. Let's keep looking at these over here. You do understand this, right? - Yes? - Yes. Yes? Ok, Mari Rodriguez... You're gonna have to share until I get a copy of the textbook. Yolanda, can you share your textbook with her and help her catch up? And you're going to have to turn that over. It's off. ( Students Ooh and Ahh ) Ok, ok, relax. Just make it disappear, ok? What? Nothing, you're my neighbor is all. And? Do I owe you something? I'm just saying. You look like a little fly. Pinche mosquita. Ok. I'm working on getting your homework posted online. Tomorrow, I do not want to hear, "What was the homework, Mr. G?" I love the exoitement. Wait, Cuata. I'm putting it on my left eye. That means you got to put it on your right. So did you guys check out the new girl? What's up with that freakin' attitude? Trying to act all tough and shit in front of everyone. Please. I think she's trouble. Ay, Cuata. You don't even know her, Vicky. Neither do you! Just saying. It must suck being new at a big ass school. People can be rude and stuff. Ay, Yoli. Here you go again with that holy santita bullshit. It's getting real old. I left that back in junior high. I'm just saying. Well, get over it. That's what I'm saying. Don't trip off her girl. She's just feeling off and shit. Yeah, I guess. (School bell rings) She's just bitchy right now cuz she started her period and I didn't. (School bell rings) What's up with Mr. G? Why does he always give us a lot of homework? I don't know, man. I don't know what's up. This is geometry. He has to calm down. Shit, you're smoking a joint, Yoli? Right, Cuata? Dude, it smells like weed. Maybe that's how her number two smells. You're so stupid! Hey! What the hell? You think you're some kind of hot shit? I am hot shit, dumbass. Crazy bitch! Hey! Hey! Alright, who's got it? Hey, don't look at me. We don't know either. Let's just see what the office knows. Mari. Thank you. Thanks for pushing me out in time. My parents would have freaked out over something like this. So what'd the Dean say? I flushed that roach down the toilet so all they could do is warn me: next time I'm out. Out? Yeah. They said I could make it easier on myself if I just drop out and get my GED. They're stupid. It's not that crazy. But what about college? It's a waste of time. It's not a waste of time. It is for me. Look, after school we can meet up. We'll go through my Geometry book and go over whatever other stuff. History, English... Weekdays are good. Weekends too. One of that. Thank you. I don't know about studying on the weekends. You know, if you do good, it's like the biggest... Even if you don't go to college, just imagine having the chance to shove those grades in their faces. They'd feel so stupid. I have all the homework. We can start today. You know you don't owe me shit, right? I know. Mama! (Music plays from the TV) (TV turns off) Please Mari? Nope! We should play some Ska while doing our homework. You won't be able to focus. Yeah, but it'll make it fun. Hello, my daughter. Hello. No. Damn! You ok? I found it in my mom's drawer. You look nice, Mari. Yeah? Yeah. Mom's calling you. Let's break up into groups. You three, Chapter 10. You three in the middle, Chapter 11. Chapter 10 on the outside. You three also Chapter 11 and Chapter 10. Oops. Douche! Skank! She's calling you. Hop on already! Hold on. But not too tight. Just like that. Alright. No, no, no, no, no! Wait! My turn, my turn! - You better not drop me! - I'm not! I'm not! - Promise. - I promise. I hope you end up liking Huntington Park. Why wouldn't I? Cuz sometimes the air smells like pan dulche and others say it smells like chemicals. Or like the Las Cuatas say, "It smells like ass. " Holy... Are you okay? What did I say! Alright, that's enough. Oh, shit. It's open. We should go, Mari. Come on, Mosquita. "I love Chuy. " "Hydo Y Rusbi por vida. " "Guera Y Chaparra friends forever. " "Mosquita y Mari. " Fuck the rest. Whenever anybody gets on our nerves, this'll be our "kick it" spot. This is private property, Mari. We can't just make it our own. It's not like anybody's gonna come here anytime soon. "Smurf is my man. All bitches stay away. " Yeah, you fight for your little blue man, dumbass. I bet you that guy Smurf got his name from wearing his ugly-ass shorts. What? Nothing. Smurfette. Oh, hell, no! Gotcha. Look, you can do the recording and me and Vera can do the rest. Ok? We're going to be doing a random survey. Right, Cuata? Yeah, random survey. But what kinda survey? Just press this button to record, ok? What's up with you questioning your long-term friends about shit? So here we are at my high school. And we're gonna be doing a random survey where we're get to ask guys if they've ever popped a boner in school. Ay, Cuata. What? It's just a question! Anyways, we get to talk to some cute-ass guys. Or what? You don't want to talk to them? I never said that. Well, then record me. Hey! Have you guys ever popped a boner in school? No. Whatever. Liars! I don't know. Maybe once or twice? I don't know. (whispering) No way. And how did you hide it? Come on. Can you stop asking me that? Hey, have you ever popped a boner in school? Yeah, when I saw your mom. Your mom, bitch. I'll probably just block it with these books. Like this. Wouldn't it hurt? Uh, I don't think so. What about, like if you need to stand up, like, the teacher tells you to write something on the board? I'll carry my books like this. Oh, my god, I know him! Go ask him, Yoli! - I'm not gonna ask him! - Go ask him! Dude, stop acting like that again. Hey, she has something she wants to tell you. Well... What? Have you ever popped a boner at school? Yeah. How about right now? You getting one just talking to her? Vicky, just turn it off already! It's getting boring. I was going to anyway. Damn! I'm sorry. That was stupid. When two angles and a side of a triangle are congruent to two angles and a side of a second triangle, what does that prove? I didn't get that far in the book. Just remember "ass," like in culo, but spelled A-A-S. It stands for Angle-Angle-Side. Easy, huh? The culo theorem. Got it. Look, stupid. Those sissies suppose to inspire us? It's better than, "Smurf is my man, all bitches stay away. " I'll go with the little blue man. It's not that bad. Yes! There's a pot in here. Know what they called her? Guadalupe la frutera. The grading scale is on the board. Mari... Forget this shit. It just means we have to work a little harder. I'll meet you at the shop so don't even trip. We can't meet up? I have some stuff to take care of for my mom, you know. Maybe later. Yeah, ok. - Hey. - Hey. How long you going to be doing that on Pacific? As long as it takes. Why you getting like all gloomy and shit? Not even. We're gonna meet at the shop tomorrow? Yeah, don't worry. I'll make it work. I'm just saying... I know, Yoli. But it's not all I'm about. (TV plays in the background) Ok, stop. Stop! Stop! Stop. First tell me what you're thinking about. Nothing... Just about my parents. What about them? I was remembering this one day, awhile back. My dad put on this CD he bought off this guy on Pacific. He put it on then went and pulled out this old cowboy hat I've never seen him in. Then he approached my mom and then they waltzed around the room... Not caring about their usual, resting up for work the next day. It was like they were somewhere else for that moment. It was kinda beautiful. You think too much. Come on, scaredy-cat. What about your father? He died. Some sort of accident... He used to drive one of those big-ass 18-wheelers up, down, and all around this place. Did he ever take you for a ride? No... He was always just too happy to be home with us. At least everyday was different for him. Different like today. (siren wails) (both singing) They started to play... To play... Dancing with death! I got to go... Here. Some guy who flyers keeps eyeballing my shit. This? Fool, that's a classic. (Music plays from the Walkman ) Yolanda! Yolanda! (Music plays from the Walkman ) Photos and videos. Photos for passports. Thank you. Under a bunch of crap. I made them find one. Sorry it took so long, Mari. Cool. I never thought I'd hear you say that about a textbook. Cool for when I can't meet up with you. You know, makes it easier. We're going to meet up at the shop today, aren't we? Nah, I got that other stuff to do, remember? I'll go with you. Why not? Crazy! That's not you. How do you know that's not me? I ain't playing, Yoli. I can do my work at home. Don't trip. Don't even trip, girl. We got your back. We got plans for us to kick it after school and just have fun. (Chattering, gossiping) So are you like a freshman, a junior, a sophomore? No, I'm a sophomore. I remember when I used to be a sophomore. (Yolanda) That's cool. So you're a junior? Yeah. Oh, that's cool. Yeah, you like it? Yeah, so far. I like your braid! It's really long. Who did it for you? My little sister. I can braid it for you sometime. That's be cool! So who was that? My best friend. Need to talk to her or something? Are you sure? Yeah. So you want to come? No, I'm ok. Come with us, Yoli! You'll have fun. No, I'm ok. Giving up the studies to hang out with your little boyfriend? He's not my boyfriend. Yeah, he's probably a faggot. He's just someone me and Las Cuatas know from school. Why do you care? Please. If you want to hang out with the twiddle-dums and the rest of them, that's on you, stupid. Stupid you. Yeah, whatever. Yeah, whatever. Photos and videos. Photos for passports. What? The Walkman. You told me to hold onto it so that guy doesn't eyeball it. Go play with your little boyfriend or something. Boo! Come on, let's go! You're finished? Am I speaking Chinese or something? Come on! This ain't even a real video game, Mari. Yeah, it's a piece of shit! Get off my lane! Dude, not even! I'm not on your lane! Oh, is that right? Oh, look at me! I'm coming up in second. That's right. Touch it now! That's what I thought! (Game ) New personaI best! I don't have anymore change. Mosquita! (Music plays from the Walkman ) It's my jam right here! (Both singing to song) Thank you. Tell me something... Something you never told anyone. I was five when we left my grandma to come here. My dad wanted her to come with us, but she refused. I still remember how everyone was afraid of her because she took care of hers no matter what. But she would always take me on these walks to this river, and we'd make tortas with beans and cheese. And we'd eat until we couldn't take it anymore. And we'd just lay there and watch the birds fly. She said if I really wanted to, I could hear the wind going through their feathers as they flapped by. And I swear to you, for a moment, I could. Ten years from now, I'm gonna save up and visit my grandma in Xalapa Mexico. By then, who cares if I can't make it back? Ten years from now, I want to- Be a doctor or lawyer. I don't even know. Maybe a truck driver? Are you gonna ride with me? You can take me to my grandma's. You can stay if you want. Yeah, I could see that. Yoli. Hello. You gotta get back to your homework! Yoli! Yoli! Yoli! Yolanda! Come on! I'm ready. Put a streak on each side, and these are going to look real cute, ok? Yolanda? No. Of course. Thank you. Yolanda... Look, um. I've got these college pamphlets and I was thinking maybe you could take a look at them. And we could talk about how to get you a tour to visit them. You know? Maybe one weekend? That sound exciting? - Yeah. - Ok. I won't lose sight. Mari? Yeah? No chocolate. Peanut butter and jelly ok? Yeah. Alright. It looks nice. Come on. Yes, that's ok. Thank you. Oh, come on. Not like this. Like this. See! That's what I'm talking about. That says, "I'm here!" No... "We're here. " Yeah, it's me and you for life. Your parents? Don Pedro's. (Music plays from the stereo ) Just for a little bit. I'm cold, Mari. Ok, but just for a little bit. You're probably going to go far way for college, huh? Wherever they accept us - here, somewhere else. Us? I'm not helping you for nothing. I can't afford it. We'll figure it out. Yeah? We'll get into school. We'll get away. Thank you. Thank you. Hi, girls! Hi, girls. No? Excuse me, but do you need help with something by any chance? In anything? No? I got a booger on my face or something? Stupid. Then? Yesterday, was kinda... I don't know. You're making a big deal out of nothing. Ok. You can be so annoying sometimes. You know that guy from the other day? Las Cuatas' friend... Well, he asked me to be his girlfriend. He's more stupider than I thought. Well, maybe I should say yes. Why not? If you don't want me to, I won't. I already told you what I think. Yeah, but- Who cares? Just say yes. I got real things to be thinking about. Not that dumb kid shit. - Mari! - What! Don't forget about the final on Monday. Yes. I'm sorry. Ok! All your books, notes, backpacks under your desks. Nothing but pens, pencils, and calculators out. Just relax. You'll all do great. Ok! Everyone with a test, you may begin! You may begin. (Students chattering) Hi, how are you? Every Saturday night... Come on, man. Hurry up. Perv. Join us every Saturday night. Mari! Hey! Hey! (knocking on door) (School bell rings) Mr. G, can I take Mari's final to her? Sorry, Yolanda. Not a final. She's gonna have to come get it herself. Thanks, Mr. G. Good work! No! My love. (loud music plays, kids laughing) Scoot over, Yoli. I like this song! Yoli, you're gonna start again with that holy santita bullshit? No, I've done it before. Well, then hit it! It was different. Come on, a joint is a joint. (All sounds fade away leaving only music ) What's wrong? Stop the car. Stop the car! What the hell, Yoli! Look, stop! It's ok, dude. Ok? Just on a trip. Just get back in the car. You'll feel much better! - Just shut up, Cuata! - I'm walking home. Yoli, don't be like that. - Alright, then go! - I will! You know, it's not like we give a shit! Good! Cuz I don't give a shit either! Let's just go, Cuata.
