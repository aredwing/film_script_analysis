General Vasilly Topov was not only my father, he was my comrade, my leader in battle. And now his fight for the liberation of Pasalan is my own. His army is under my command, and I will stop at nothing to make his dreams become reality. Prime Minister Musayev, we have occupied the Chernobyl nuclear power plant. The abandoned city surrounding the complex is under our control. No longer can we be ignored. Now, we are the occupiers. Any attempt to penetrate its borders will be met with fierce resistance. The reactor has been rigged with explosives. Detonators have been set to 72 hours. Should our demands go unanswered, they will go off. Such an explosion would produce a radiation cloud than the bombs dropped on Japan. We call for the imminent release of all We call for the complete and total independence of Pasalan. Nothing less will be deemed acceptable. Prime Minister Musayev, this fight is not only about country and politics, it is about blood. Mine... ...and now yours. We have your children. Should you ignore my demands they will be the first to go. I urge you to act responsibly. We ask only to be free, as you would want your children to be free. Come on, come on, come on. That's it. Hey, take it easy. This way. Okay, come on, come on. Over there, right over there. All right, now take it easy. Take it easy. Hey, easy! For Christ's sake, there's spare parts in there! Morons. Sit. - How do you feel? - I feel good. - Any problems? - No. - Do you know where you are? - Yes. - Do you know why you're here? - Yes. Is it necessary for you to question the things you don't know? - No. - Excuse me, Doctor. Thank you. Okay, can you please move your right fingers, one by one, beginning with the forefinger? - Limited range. - All right. Okay. - Do you feel warm? - Yes. I'm gonna cool you off. Very good. You were very good today. So you've seen the security tape from the museum? I have. You want to describe what you saw, or shall I? I saw an armed assailant take direct hits to vital areas and still manage to overpower a security detail. This remind you of something? White Tower was shut down over a year ago. - Maybe it was something else. - Maybe. But we should still prepare for the worst, however remote the possibility. So, if we assume the worst, the problem becomes ours to share. Hypothetically. So then, hypothetically, what is our shared solution? Let's load them up. On April 26th, 1986, Chernobyl Reactor Number 4 exploded. Worst nuclear power plant accident in history. The ensuing fire released a plume of highly radioactive fallout into the atmosphere. The city of Chernobyl was evacuated and has remained abandoned for over 20 years. We believe the rebels have set up their bunker in one of the buildings adjacent to the reactor complex, about two miles due east from our current position in Chernobyl city. While the site itself no longer has enough fuel to make a bomb, it has 100 times the radiation. An explosion in Reactor Number 3 would release that radiation. And now for the bad news. It appears the general's son has gotten his hands on some of our weaponry. Here to explain, Dr. Richard Porter. In the 1960s, with war in Asia looming, the U.S. began research into Operation Black Tower, what we've now come to call the Universal Soldier program. A high-response, self-sustaining, quick-healing, stronger, faster soldier, fueled by high-concentrate nutritional supplements. A soldier that operates without conscience or hesitation. By freezing a human body with nitrogen-based gas, repairing it and reheating it through thyroid and pituitary augmentation, we were able to revive a recently-deceased soldier, and, in the process, improve them. Programmable and erasable. One that you can turn on and turn off. Deceased, as in dead? That's right. Five years ago, the program was suspended, or, rather, replaced by a program known as White Tower. Led by Dr. Robert Colin, under my supervision, White Tower sought to improve and perfect what Black Tower had introduced. Using gene therapy techniques developed during Dr. Colin's cloning research, we were able to give our UniSols a DNA tune-up from the inside out. The new model was superior in every physical capacity, a virtual killing machine. The next generation UniSols, or NGUs, as we like to call them. There was, however, an incident in a government building. Twelve dead. Nobody injured. It was considered to be a malfunction, though I believe their temperature had not been properly moderated. We were instructed to shut down all the existing NGUs, which we did. But there was a break-in. Some things were taken, including a Series 7 model. We have reason to believe it was my former colleague, Dr. Colin. We suspect he's been continuing his studies. Colin's been operating out of Eastern Europe as a gun-for-hire. Gentlemen, we'll be fighting against the perfect soldier. One who is impervious to injury and pain, quicker than hell, and with a nervous system unaffected by radiation. We have four first-generation UniSols that are more than capable in this type of endgame. Dismissed. - You say four, Colonel. - That's correct. - I thought there was five. - There were. Now there's four. What happened to the fifth? He's the subject of a privately-funded program run by Dr. Sandra Fleming. - Project Phoenix. - Doing what? Behavioral modification therapy or psychological rehabilitation, as Dr. Fleming calls it. She's trying to reintroduce him into society. He was one of the very first, but by far the best of the group. Dr. Fleming has been conducting her research in Switzerland. I think of escape. Peaceful feeling. - Shame. - Why do you say that? - I don't know. - Yes, you do. Just say the first thing that comes into your mind. I don't remember. Maybe for things I have done. What have you done, Luc? I don't know. I think he's hungry. Why don't you feed him? How do you feel? Helpless. Maybe you're feeling the weight of responsibility. It's what it feels like to grow older, Luc. Do you realize how far you've come? Two years ago when we started this, when you first woke up, you couldn't remember the day before. - My head feels full. - It's just another stage in your development. We're getting there. You may have forgotten our agreement, Doctor, but I haven't. Consider this my last reminder. I haven't forgotten, I've been in surgery, which appears to be quite a success. - So, when will we do it? - I told you, I'm gonna run a diagnostic... I have to guarantee the safety of my men, as well as my own. It'll be taken care of. So you want to wait? Then I guess the wire transfers can wait as well. What's the hurry, right? - Miles. - Yes, Doctor? The general's son is growing anxious. He'd like to be micro-chipped this instant. It can't possibly wait. I'm nobody's son anymore, Doctor. It is Commander Topov. Right. I've done it to myself. It does hurt a little bit now. Maybe for you. - Failsafe is active, sir. - Satisfied? No. My men. Fine. Round them up. Gentlemen, two-pronged objective. Securing of the reactor site and the dismantling of the detonators, and the extraction of the two known hostages. Now, we have reason to believe that the children are being held here. However, their positions could be fluid, so we're moving in on a staggered six-front maneuver. Disable all communication and transportation vehicles that you encounter, and remember the objective. If it comes down to either-or, we go big picture and we take the reactor. - Are there any questions? - What if we encounter the freak? Avoidance, if you can. - Keep it occupied. - Is that the best you can do, Doctor? It's probably programmed to defend the reactor site, so it'll stick close to it like a nest, making it impossible to use high-powered weaponry in the presence of the explosives. Captain, your men should not engage with the NGU. That's what my men are for. - It's hot in here. - Take your coat off. - We've been here before? - Every week. That's what I thought. - Can I get you guys some coffee? - Yeah, sure, I'll have some coffee, thanks. - What would you like, Luc, to drink? - Orange juice. Great. I'll be right back to take your orders. - How are your knees feeling? - A little better. I think the anti-inflammatories are working. We need to get you some more of those. The weather report said there may be another snow front on the way. Could get a couple of inches over the weekend. I think the cold weather's been affecting your joints. The next shipment should be in by next week, so... Luc! Luc, stop! Luc! No! Luc, stop! Luc! Luc, stop! Stop! No! Luc, no! No! Luc, stop, stop! Luc, stop! - Somebody help him. - Go! Go! Go! - Man down! We got a man down. - Move, move, move! - Let's go! Move, move, move! Go! - Come on, come on! Hold fire, holding fire. All units proceed to reactor complex. Repeat, hold fire, holding fire. All units proceeding to reactor complex. Copy that. Unit One holding fire. All units holding fire. - All systems green, sir. - Good. The complex in sight. All units falling into position, over. Unit One, Unit Two, two units, report to the south perimeter. Cover your... Unit One holding. Contact back. I'll take the north side. Unit Two is on the move. Proceeding to north perimeter. Unit Two to north perimeter. Unit Two, hold position in north perimeter. We're on the south perimeter, Structure 3. We're going in. Over. Burke, the show's on. Send them in and provide cover. Sir, we have successfully taken out all lines of defense. We need to send in two units. Negative. Send in the freaks. That's an order, Burke. Pull back. Roger that. It's all yours, boys. Don't fuck it up. How long before they reach the Meeting Point A? Stand by, sir. There he is. There he is. - Shut him down. - I'm on it. Holy shit, did you see that? Did you see that? One is out. Tell Two and Three One is down. We need Two, Three and Four to triangulate on the new position. Do it! We're gonna triangulate... Come on! We're gonna triangulate on what's... Hang on! Triangulate... Listen to me. Let him go! Let him go! Move Four to the reactor. Have Three engage. Have Three engage. - What the hell is going on? - He's too fast. They can't track him. All right, let's get Four to the reactor. Get Four. Four moving to the reactor, sir. Four moving. - Sir, approaching the reactor right now. - Okay, there they are. There they are. - Shut them down, Doctor. - Deactivate. Repeat, deactivate. Complete evac. Send the order. Burke, complete evac. Pull them out! - Evac. Evac. - Pull back now! - Get everybody out of there! - Complete evac now. Complete evac. Colonel. Tell them to retreat. Get them out. Get the men out of there. - Retreat. I repeat, retreat... - Get them all out. Tell him that is an order... - You're not coming in clear. - Sir. We're under fire. Unit One under fire. Falling back. Shit. Colonel Petrov's down. Request transportation. No, no. Request transport. Go. Go. Listen to me, God damn it. You're coming with me. Go now. Take him with you. Go. Take him with you! Go! Look. Is he coming? - How's my boy? - I feel good. Good. That's very good. That's my good boy. Yes. Magnificent. That's because we're gonna give you a chance to explain the situation when they get here. - I told you from the start... - We were sitting ducks out there. You don't need to tell me. I saw it with my own eyes. If you let us in, we would've taken him out ourselves. You didn't stand a chance. You never did. - Hey, hey, come on. Knock it off. Get back. - You don't have to like it, but it's the truth. It took on your entire outfit and forced you to retreat. One man. We're talking about a perfect specimen. One who knows nothing other than to obey an order. Something you seem to know nothing about. - Fucking knock your teeth out! - Hey, hey, hey! Get back! What the hell was that? "This imprudent act of aggression has resulted in a swift response. "We have detonated one of the explosives around the reactor. "Consider it a warning shot. "The world doesn't appear to apply pressure to the Bosorow bullies. "They're allowing them to stall. "You are not doing anything. Think about your children.' ' I empathize with your father. I know how he feels. You only hope for your family to be safe. And when they are not you carry it with you like a cancer. Unlike me, he can change this. I would rather die than see my father give in to you. And so it may be, for all of us. Hey. Stockholm syndrome, huh? Bonding with the captives. You know, I'm touched. What's the matter with you, Doctor? Did the kids pick on you in school? Yes, yes, they did. I was asthmatic, bad athlete, terrible skin. - Don't be so hard on yourself. - No, no, it's true. Perhaps I overcompensated. Yes, we all congratulate you on your science project. Now, why don't you go back to your room? You're boring us. Hey, you know, kids, this is an important lesson. You always have to ask yourself who's in control. It's not always the one doing the talking. Sometimes it's the guy in the background. I mean, okay, let's be honest with ourselves here. You call that an army? Come on, it's a bunch of peasants with slingshots. But just one of my men, just one... That's all it took. Now I want you to imagine an army of men like that. That, children, that is real power. Bravo. - Very captivating. - Thank you. Or maybe your poodle would like to get a word in. My poodle. Well, he's kind of shy. - No, please... - He's not blessed with the gift of the gab. Then maybe you can shut the fuck up and do what I'm paying you for. Hey, you're the boss. We think that the main detonators are over here. Pull back and encompass the whole compound. Copy that, sir. That's the cooling tower. If we can get in those pipes, we can access the reactor there. It's probably been capped off after the accident, but it can be reopened, sir. He's here. Hello, Luc. I expect you're feeling somewhat fatigued. That's normal. The sedation should wear off soon enough. Sandra? Dr. Fleming is here and has authorized this examination, so there should be no cause for alarm. We're your friends. You're home, Luc. I have a few questions for you. Please answer yes or no. - I want to talk to Sandra. - Just answer the questions. Do you see yourself as a person who is a reliable worker? Yes. Do you see yourself as a person who is original, comes up with new ideas? No. - Is relaxed? Handles stress well? - Yes. - Starts quarrels with others? - Sometimes. Yes or no. Sometimes. I'm gonna give you something that will help with your recovery. I'm gonna make you feel better, Luc. Gonna make you whole again. Where am I? Where am I? We started him on a mixture of both psychotropic drugs and ergogenics. - His system isn't ready for that. - Methylphenidate - and mentenolone... - Please, listen to me. His nervous system will break down. You can't reverse years of hormonal therapy in a day. It's like rehabilitating a fight dog, then putting it back to fight. - This could backfire in a myriad of ways. - Rehabilitation was never part of his design. And as you can see, he's at odds with his nature. He was created to serve a need, and he's not doing that. But now you're just compounding the situation. Dr. Fleming, you have to ask yourself whether a dog, once it has tasted blood, can ever forget that taste. There is substantial power inside of him that I have spent two years regulating. If you unleash it this quickly, you may not be able to control it. Just get him up to speed, Doc. You let me worry about controlling it. Listen. You said something about some pipes earlier. - Yes, sir. - You still think you can - get in through there? - I know I can, sir. Okay, we're gonna try this your way. Listen to me. This is strictly recon. Do not engage this thing. It's not combat. You understand? - Yes, sir. - Okay, let's go. Why is she in there? Unfortunately, at the moment, she's the only one he trusts. You know, in business, as in life, people are so distrustful. - They always want insurance. - Yes, sir. I mean, whatever happened to the handshake deal? Am I right? - You're right, sir. - Failsafe. Everybody wants a failsafe. - But where is my failsafe? You understand? - Yes, Doctor. No, no, I'm asking you. Where's my failsafe? - This is your failsafe. - And why is that? Because the NGU cannot hurt the commander and his men. Right. But... But he can. Indeed he can. - Very smart, Doctor. - Of course it is. You see, Miles, there's always a way around things. Now, I want you to count his fingers and toes. No, I'm just kidding. We've come a long way from replicating sheep, wouldn't you say, Miles? Yes, sir. Happy birthday, my boy. Colonel, I can disconnect this thing. That'll tip them off too soon. Find the kids. Do not engage the freak. We need you alive. Roger that. He's going to do as he threatens, you know. Are you listening to me? I have to address the country in an hour. I can't discuss this with you right now. You are not alone in this. You think I don't know this? Sending in troops was the act of a desperate man. That frightens me. They've left me with no choice. Yes they have. Is it right to sacrifice others' children but not our own? And what then? What is proved? I am obliged to think beyond myself. Beyond our son and daughter. Obliged to what? Your image in history? If you allow something to happen to them, I will never forgive you. I hear two voices. You guys picking this up? Over. There's a female voice. That must be where he's got the kids. - We don't have all day, Miles. - Yeah, right. Okay, Doctor, all right. Miles is gonna run the diagnostic today, Andrew. Are you okay with that? - Yes. - Okay, first question. You are a punctual and reliable person. Yes. You know how to make efficient use of your time. Yes. Okay. Friends find you impulsive and unpredictable. No. You like to spend leisure time relaxing in a tranquil family atmosphere. Yes. You often contemplate the complexity of life. Yes. Andrew, did you hear the question? - Hook him up. - Yes, sir. Okay, just a sec. Andrew, listen carefully. You often contemplate the complexity of life. - No. - That's right. You have to listen, Andrew. It's important. As the leader of a nation in crisis, my decisions have been dictated by a single principle: to serve the common good of the people, no matter what might be sacrificed in the process. While pride demands aggression be met with aggression, humanity depends on diplomatic and peaceful conflict resolution. It is therefore the responsibility of those in positions of power to question any hard line policy that threatens survival as we know it. Therefore, I have authorized the release of 110 prisoners in exchange for immediate deactivation of the detonator at Chernobyl reactor three. Over the next 48 hours all troops will stand down in ceasefire mode, as the terms of exchange are implemented. The remaining prisoners will then be released in exchange for the hostages. It's over, Luc. We might have had our share of differences, but it is the result that is important, yes? Yes. For a world leader to give in to the demands of a small outfit such as our own, one should savor the rarity of the experience. The thing is, to stop at this moment would be a shameful waste of both leverage and position. Yeah, you're young, you'll learn, - but now we have to move... - It is over, - and that is that. - That's not really for you to say, because there have been expenses. Unanticipated expenses. It's hard to budget these things in advance. Now, I have an army to build. And, like you said, moments like these don't often present themselves. I don't think you're hearing me. You want to fuck around? Is that what you're trying to do? You have been paid. You and me, our business together, it is all over. You want to try to test me? Easy. Easy. Who is this? Vasilly! Okay. Very good. That's a good boy. We have to go now. You have to finish your job. Then we'll go. The children. Can I ask you a question? No, you cannot. You often contemplate the complexity of life? Hey, it's not for you to ask questions, understand? - Andrew. - Yes or no? Andrew, you're tired. You've been through a lot today. Are you a punctual and reliable person? I don't like your tone. Sit. - You answer my question. - I'm not gonna... How do you feel? Do you feel warm? Do you need me to cool you off? - Answer me. Answer my question. - You answer my question. I'm not gonna an... Andrew, I want you to sit down. I need to help... To cool you off now, please. Sit down. I order you to sit! Stop it. You have to... You know how to put every minute of your time to good purpose? - No! This is a mistake... - Are you rested? Are you happy? - Stop. Stop. No. - Yes or no? You often think about humankind and its destiny? Yes or no? Who am I? Be quiet. I'm on your side. It's okay. It's okay. Are you one of them? - Who? - One of the ones who can't be killed? Let's hope so. Now come with me and be very quiet. Come on. Come on, let's go. Come on, let's go! Colonel, they've reactivated the detonators. - What the hell are you talking about? - Look. What's the communication status on Captain Burke? None. Game's back on. Communications are down. We've got no way of knowing if anyone's alive over there. - What about Burke? - Nothing. Is it possible your creation might have had an episode, Dr. Porter? It's possible. Thirty minutes. We're officially at Defcon One. Where are we with Deveraux? As he is right now, he wouldn't stand a chance against the NGU. Dr. Fleming? If we proceed with the double dosage and leave him something in reserve, - it's possible we can get him there. - Then let's do it. But understand this is your last bullet. Assuming he survives, there'll be no controlling him, no communication hookup. He'll know only what he's been programmed for. To find those kids and stop the detonation. - Beyond that... - Who's gonna dose him? - It's not gonna be safe in there. I'll do it. - No, I will. I owe it to him. I know what's happening. - What is happening, Luc? - I'm going back. I'm going to fight. Yeah. I remember. Give it to me. I'll do it. I want to be here with you. It's not safe for you. It's okay. Go now. Go. Run! Run! Get out of here! Run! Go, go, go! Run! Fucking prick. Fucking prick... Keep asking them questions, just... Trying to get some... An answer. Nothing. Just a simple yes or no. It's ridiculous. I knew I had something to tell you. It was right there on the tip of my tongue. Shit. I'm sure I'll remember it in a minute, just... Just wait right there. Something so familiar. Can't explain it. You know exactly what I'm talking about, right? You understand. You don't have to answer. We're good like that, right? We've been over this all before. I'm just gonna do something here. I just remembered what I wanted to tell you. Wait a second. That's Luc. He's just used the booster shot. Something must have slowed him down. We'll get another 20 good minutes out of him. I hope. Come with me.
