I wasn't sure if he'd pay, or even show up. But it was never about the money. - I'm here. - Alexander T. Hope? - Do you have the money? - Yes. Let me talk to my daughter. Follow directions and stick to the plan. Am I clear? - A barge is approaching the bridge. - I see it. Go to the centre of the bridge and throw the case on the barge. - How do I know you'll release her? - You don't. - Shit. Cellular phone. - It's probably hers. Being crooked, I'm surprised my father involved the police. I guess he was just using them to retrieve the money. - Have the chopper ready to go. - Chopper standing by. - Where's my daughter? - In the trunk of her car. We've got the location. Let's get some backup. Everything was going according to plan. There was only one thing that I never could have anticipated. There's a green BMW. That's our car! Hit it. All units, I'm following a green BMW. ETH 1. Headed west on... Where the hell are we? Stay right on him. You with the case, set it down. Put your hands on your head. - Where's the chopper? - With the barge. We lost the money. - How? - The chopper blew it away. We lost the money. We lost the hostage and we lost the perps. I don't believe this. RELIABLE STORAGE Thank you. This guy says he's expected. He's not on our security list. Mr. Perkins is a colleague and friend of the family. - I'm Emily's uncle. - We'll wait till they make a move. - What do you know about they? - We saw a man in her BMW. - Dark hair, Caucasian. - He wasn't apprehended? No... What was your name again? I'm sure these gentlemen are doing everything within their power. This is a very trying time. I'd like a moment alone with Mr. Perkins. Sure, we'll be outside. The fools also lost the ransom. Hi. Why bring them in? Kidnappers always insist the police are kept out of it. I have a problem. I have to close a deal in Brussels on the 25th. - I have to be there in person. - It must be important. They're all important, Raymond. This one more than most. - Are there people against it? - There always are. Could be they're behind this, playing on your concern for Emily. - Wouldn't you think that? - Put a lid on this. I don't want it turning into a circus. Not now. You should've called me first. - Vincent, what can I get you? - Just a cup of coffee. - Are you going to be long? - Two minutes. - Turn the VCR on... - A lot of cops around today. Don't mind them. They do it twice a year, right before an election. Rousting crack dealers. Shit! Put the tape in and hit the pause and record... - Sir... - Hang on a second, honey. - My wife is in the hospital. - Just hit the record button... I've been waiting here for God knows how long. Long! - Come on over. - Thank you. Thank you. Can you put that in a paper cup.? Greg, we have a problem. - Did you get it? - Yeah, meet me at the warehouse. Hope residence. Miss Emily. One moment, please. - Cell phone again? - Shit! Emily? Where are you? You tell me. I don't know. - I'm in a warehouse full of cars. - Now you're in trouble. - Guess who? - Uncle Ray? Why are you there? - Looking for you. I missed you. - Ray, I've been kidnapped. You're father's concerned. I've never seen him so upset. I don't know what to do. This place is locked and barred. - Maybe I can talk to someone? - Someone? Who? - Who's letting you use the phone? - There's no one here. I need help! Sir, can I have my car keys? - Can I have my keys? - Hold on. My hand's going in my pocket, okay? - Give me my keys and let me go. - How did you get out? The trunk popped open. You can have my car, just let me go. Don't look at me. - I'm not going to hurt you. - You're not going to hurt me? - I don't even carry a gun. - Are you sure? - Positive. - All right. Stop. That's not cool. Give me that. That was a good kick. I don't want to fight. I don't want to fight. I'm not going to hurt you, all right? Are you mental? I told you, I don't want to fight. It wasn't me who put you in that trunk. So cool it. I have to pee. - I can do this on my own. - Put something on that cut. - What? - From one of those tubes. Asshole. You don't know where you are or who I am. Don't do me like that. You're done? You don't want to play any more? Vinnie? It's pay day. I got your money. I got half what we got for the Porsche. - What's the problem? - We've got a problem. - Shoot. - A big problem. - I get in the car... - Is that the car? - I love this colour. - Listen to me now. I'm driving out of the lot, thomp! Two undercover cars on my tail. Red cherries and everything. I'm driving against traffic. The adrenalin is pumping so hard I can't see straight. - What happened to the cops? - I lost 'em. Great. Nothing to worry about. Did we order a Ferrari? - You are a genius. Beautiful! - Greg, the problem ain't over. What? I bring the car in. I put it on the hoist. - I look, and the thing is moving. - Right, it's on a hoist. I bring the car down and open the trunk. Bang! - I find the owner in the trunk. - The owner? - Let me out of here, asshole! - Who's that? That's the owner. - Will you uncuff me now? - Jesus Christ, she's good-looking. Your friend has kidnapped me and you're an accomplice. - I'm not an accomplice to this. - What's your problem? - You're both gifted speakers. - She's got a good sense of humour. - She's seen your face, right? - I wanna get rid of her. - Did she see the building? - She was in the trunk. - How did she get out of the trunk? - I don't know. If she doesn't know where we are, put her back in and drive her away. - Where should I dump her? - I don't know. Take her to a show. Take her anywhere... way outside the city. The medicine cabinet. - Be careful. She scares me. - Yeah, she's quite a challenge. Greg.? - Put the guys back a while. - Call me. - Get in the trunk. - I'm not getting in the trunk. I can't have you see this place. I'm not going to hurt you. - You're sticking me in the trunk. - Don't look at me. - The easy way or the hard way? - You said you wouldn't hurt me. - It'll have to be the hard way. - What's the hard way? - What will happen to my car? - Forget the car. Think of yourself. You promised you wouldn't hurt me. You're a liar like everyone else. - Please, get in the trunk. - Can I just wear this cap? - Look, I can't see anything. - How stupid do you think I am? - How stupid is there? - Get in there. - Give me this. - You didn't have to do that. Put that out. - Put that cigarette out. - All right. - Put your seat belt on. - Don't take me too far. - Keep your head between your legs. - I had plans tonight. - Understand? - Yes. Be friendly now. - You had plans tonight? - That was before I was kidnapped. - What are you looking for? - Names and phone numbers. Anything to do with her life these days. - Does she have a boyfriend? - If she does, we've never met. - Look at that. - When was this? She was, I guess, ten. She'd just got her black belt. - I wasn't there. - I know. Look at that. Can you believe it? She had that framed. H El RESS BLAM ED FOR BOARDI NG SCHOOL FI RE - This could be one of her games. - Really? What did I do this time? Forget her birthday? - So she takes me for $1 million. - I don't think it's about money. Don't you mess with my car. I'm very attached to my car. I'll puke all over your car. It's been long enough. I'm getting it back. Don't paint it shit-brown. How much will you and your faggot boyfriend get for it? $40? Why did you steal it? You wouldn't know about pride of ownership or what loss is. You steal. You probably get a hard-on doing it. All part of the run-till-you-drop, razor's-edge world of auto theft. I once stole a Ferrari with a chihuahua in the back. - He made less noise than you do. - He speaks! - No one knows shit about Hope. - We know he's rich. Dirty money. Money in banks in the Caribbean and Switzerland. When that ransom money blew away, he didn't give a shit. Maybe he just doesn't show his feelings. There's a warehouse on fire right in our target area. - Can I have a cigarette? - You can smoke in the trunk. - What's your name? - John Doe. John Doe... Why are we turning? I don't think this road goes all the way through. Are you stopping? Do you have to pee? I'd like to pee. - Sorry about the conversation. - Thanks. My hands are killing me. The ride's over. Get out. You can't be serious. You've got to be kidding. - Did you dump the chihuahua here? - It's 20 minutes to the highway. - It's dark. - It's night-time. Hit the road. - Bye. - I can't go. Do I have to drag you out? - A girl can always get picked up. - I can't get out. Don't throw any kicks or punches. Just get out. Not here! Take me back to the highway! Please, don't leave me here. Don't be afraid. Stay right there. Look, a shooting star. Make a wish. - Wish you were here. - No, I'm going to die! - You can't leave me here. - Get off the damn hood. Are you going to leave me? Look what you did. You scratched the paint. You're a real screwy kid, you know that? Get in! It's your lucky day. Gas, food and lodging, two miles. - You can't drive me two more miles? - It's just business. Come on, road. I hope you enjoy my car. The kid did some major shopping this month. A Porsche Carrera, a Mercedes 500 SL and a Ferrari Boxer. - I drove one of them once. - I'd never drive a car like that. There's too much anger out there. Too much envy. If I saw a guy like me driving a car like that, it could get very ugly. Know what I mean, Gus? I'm talking to you. - Which way am I going? - Straight. Turn over here. Holy shit! Look at that. Keep moving. Let's get out of here. How are you doing? I've got $15.50 in number two and whatever you've got. $28.35. The ownership of every car but one is unclear. That last car is a BMW. License plate ETH 1. It belongs to missing kidnap victim Emily T. Hope, - - Daughter to millionaire Alex ander Hope, - - who was recently investigated for ex change violations. Police think this could've been the hideout for the kidnappers. - Do people live in this area? - There's a few artists' lofts. - What about the fire? - A young guy lived there. I hope he's okay. He told me he was an artist. I know about him. I came over to see his stuff. - I'm a painter, also. - Really? Was the warehouse his studio? Did he live there? He lived there. He comes here for breakfast. - He's got another place up north. - Is that right? Yeah, he sent me this postcard last time he went. That's you. Look at that. Smile... Look at that! Some things never change. That's great. They don't write 'em like they used to. "Devil Moon". That's a classic. Could I buy one? Yeah! I've got it in cassette, too. Great. Thanks. - How about one of each? - Sure. Emily. Can I have a word with you? Your car burnt up. Emily! Emily, I'm dead meat. Listen, you don't understand what's happening. My warehouse burnt down. They found your car. They know you're missing. They all think I'm part of your kidnapping prank. - There are people after me. - I'm not one of them. Stop walking! It's driving me crazy. Get off the street. I'm sorry I stole your car. Believe me, I'm sorry. - I don't need a kidnapping rap. - That's not my problem. Can you just call your family? Tell them you're fine. Then I can get to my house and get on with my life. - You're asking me to help you? - Yeah. - Why should I? - I've been nice to you. - Nice? - Yeah, under the circumstances. It's been a pretty rough day. You had me handcuffed in your car. You almost left me in the wilderness. I've got a Twinkie in the car. It's all yours if you want it. Make this call for me. I'm asking you in a nice way. Please, make this call for me. It's not like I'm asking you to turn water into wine. Come on. - What car did the kidnappers drive? - A white Cutlass Supreme. I don't have any money. - 206... - 206-555-0166. - Collect call from Emily T. Hope. - Hope residence. I have a collect call from Emily T. Hope. - Go ahead with your call. - John, is my father there? - Emily, where are you? - Hi, Dad, I'm okay, but... Daddy, he made me touch his penis. Touch what? I didn't really want to call him, you know. - Get away from my car. - I've got to get my bag. - Get away from my car. - I've got to get my bag. I wouldn't want to be handcuffed next to me, the way I feel now. Where's the key? Give me the key. Spit it out. You made me swallow it. Open up. - Open up. - It's not in there. - It's gone. - You crawled out from under a rock. Watch the road. What are you looking for? I told you. I swallowed the key. I hate this brush. You won't find it in there. I'm the only one who can straighten things out for you, so relax. Your phone call just added 30 years to my prison term. I'm now a child molester, kidnapper and rapist. I'm going to the police station to turn myself in. I'd rather be there than sitting here with you. There he is. Look at that. Vincent's warehouse burnt down and Kistler's out eating linguini. - You want to do this? - No, I ain't dressed. All right, I'll be right back. - Hey, I'm Stick. - Monique. - Will you excuse us? - It's okay. - Stickster, sit down. - Funny guy. This place is very eclectic. Don't you know that word? How about "catastrophic"? That's more relevant. Pay attention, birdbrain. Did you see Vincent? Did you give him the money? Did you see the place get torched? - What? - That's right. It made the news. What about Mr. Dokas? It's his niece's birthday. 21, and no Ferrari. She won't like that. - Gosh! - What? Vincent was talking about Brazil. It's nothing, really. Vincent's got the money and is going to Brazil. And you say, "Gosh!" What sort of word is gosh? That's it? Oh, Monique is back. Gosh! You keep saying gosh. See how far that gets you. You really look good. I don't usually like guys who drive this kind of car. What is it? An Aston Martin? Wait! You've got a phone? Is that your phone? - You have a phone? - Yes, no one has this number. - Answer it. - It's probably a wrong number. What'll happen when you're really in trouble? When you cry help, and everyone thinks you're playing games. - This has nothing to do with you. - Let me talk to Vincent. Vincent? Who's Vincent? - Who's letting you use the phone? - I'm alone. Ray, stay out of this. I tell you... Vincent, John Doe, whoever you are, drop me off at the next motel. All right, you're all checked in. Let me ask you a question. Do you have the key? - Do you? - Don't hurt your precious car. I don't give a damn. It's always in the boot. Sorry about that. - Thank you. - Here. - It's been real... - Yeah, you know my face and my car. It'll be interesting to see what happens. How old are you? Twelve. All right, if you say so. - You'd better be careful. - Yeah, what the hell. Bye. I'll tell you a little-known fact. They base the colours of BMWs on women's mascara. Phone call for you, Greg. It's Vincent. He says it's urgent. Where the hell are you? Don't say you're at the airport. I'm up at the cabin. Did you get my message? - Just tell me what happened. - We lost it all. It burned down. I know, I also know two guys who are really unhappy about that. It was arson. You've got to warn Dokas. - Dokas wants his money back. - We're lucky. I have it right here. Be with you in a minute. Just bring it down here. I shouldn't be driving right now. I've been driving all night. - Let me get a few hours of sleep. - Okay, I'll meet you half way. The Knotty Pines bar. 3 o'clock. Don't let me down. - Got it. - Gosh! - Yeah, that's her. - Did she seem scared? No, I don't think so. The guy's okay. He's got a real cool car. The first time he was here, he bought a bottle of Jack D. - Was he alone? - Yeah. He came back with the girl. - She used the phone. - Did you hear what she said? No... But I did see them kissing in the car. - Kissing? - Yeah. - Thanks. - No problem. - Hi. - It's cool, man. It was arson. - It could've been Indians. - Are you going someplace? Let's give Mr. Dokas a call so I can tell him what happened. Do I look like I work for somebody called Dokas? - I'm Uncle Ray. - Is that supposed to mean anything? Emily's Uncle Ray. Jesus Christ! I tell you... I am no kidnapper. - How did you find me? - A lady gave me a postcard. I got the town. The old boy in the store told me the rest. I bought this coat there. Do you like it? Emily is impetuous. She does things without thinking. - It's characteristic of the young. - I didn't do what she said I did. I never touched her, and she never touched me. Maybe it's my military background or my father's strong discipline, - - But I've always approached duty with blind obedience. I deliver. I don't confuse a particular task with the big picture. - Give me a break. - I must find Emily. - She's at the Red Cloud Motel. - Good, let's go. You can find it yourself. Put that bag down! - That's insurance. - Put the bag down. Put your shoes on. Take your coat. You'll freeze your ass off outside. Come on. You okay, miss? The night clerk said your boyfriend left. Checkout time is... Noon time. Thank God you're safe! - How much was the ransom? - It doesn't matter. This girl does. Do you want some more coffee? Hello. Are you okay? - Not having a happy day? - I've never really had one. It's men, isn't it? They make you promises they never intend to keep. They say they'll buy you a house, but they don't. You can't trust 'em. She's not bad. I bought the CD, too. I might make you a gift of it if things work out between us. That's a lot of money back there. - I earned it, and without a gun. - You stole a lot of cars. - It pays well. What do you do? - What did Emily say I do? Not much... But it don't look good. How come? Did I hurt you? Did I shoot you in the groin? Are those options? Is that seat taken? Coffee, please. - Miss me? - I guess. Was I supposed to? Look at this place. This is really a slice of Americana. Yeah, Rockwell should've painted it. I'm not going back with you. - Okay... Let's talk. - Nothing to talk about. This is family business. Let me go. Vincenzo, por favor. Sit over there. - Did I lay a finger on you? - No, he didn't do anything. Thank you. Who paid for that motel room last night? Right, I did. - You're giving me a headache. - I need some peace of mind here. Right. You look good. Pale, but good. How come you're pale? I thought you lived in Costa Rica. I stay in the house a lot. If you're here because you're worried about me, I appreciate it. But if my father ordered you to bring me home, I'm not going. Emily... Can we go someplace else? Don't you think it's strange that my father isn't sitting here now? Yes, it's strange, but strange and normal are not my job. This isn't about tattoos and burning down the school library. - The cops and the FBI want you. - Daddy's lawyers will get rich. They'll earn it this time. You're facing felony charges. Attempted grand theft. Theft by deceit. Conspiracy... - What are you talking about? - Tell me. I don't have my wallet. There's the check for the coffee. I'll get the bag myself and bring you back the keys. Yes! That's what I'm going to do. Give my car keys to a car thief. I've been a good sport till now. I can't wait much longer. - Go order yourself some waffles. - Two minutes. Two minutes. I'm tired of tossing salad, if you know what I mean. There goes my bargaining chip. I'll give him to the police. - He could name names. - You can't do that. - He's a thief. - He's an innocent thief. What are you saying? Have you formed some attachment to him? You're not turning him in. I'm trying to keep you out of jail. Away from all those sociopathic, gang-banging lesbians. With that mouth of yours, I'm sure your dance card would be filled. I'll take you home. I'm not asking. Let's go. What's wrong with you? I'm taking you home! I ain't going with you! I never should've married you. My papa made me do it. That man beat me! He's trying to keep me from my baby. Vincent, let's go. He's got a gun. - This is good. - He's got a gun! The lady wants to leave, and you're not going to stop her. - I'm saving your ass. - Save the trees. - It's not your concern. - I'm making it my concern. - That could've been you. - He landed on his head. He's going to turn you in to try and clear my name. - It'd be your word against mine. - Don't be a jackass. He's going to kill you. I'll stand here and watch you die. Peace! - Do you think he's going to shoot? - Yes, run! I'm the only person in the world who can get your money back. - Quit being so stubborn. - Right. Come on, get off. A guy left the keys in his pickup. I'll start it up, and you jump in. We're gonna get pulled over. I can feel it. - Just act like you own the car. - How do I do that? - Act like you're in control. - Where are we going? - Knotty Pines. - What for? So I can meet my man and say, "Greg, how are you doing?" "It's so nice to see you. I just got robbed of $200,000." "I enjoyed it. What? By her uncle. " - Is this science fiction, or what? - Why tell him that? - That money doesn't belong to me. - I'll get the money for you. - How are you going to do that? - Trust me, I'll get you the money. If you can do that for me, I'll give you a million thanks. - Start thanking me right now. - All right, thank you. - Have you got a boyfriend? - No. Why not? You're a pretty girl. Watch the road. I mean, you are. - You got a girlfriend? - No, I gave that up. I always see the potential failure. - This is Greg from the warehouse. - What's going on? I thought you lost her. She's sitting here in front of you. - Sit down. We need to talk. - Yes, we do. - Hi. - Scotch on the rocks. - Do you have any I. D? - Scotch for me. Chocolate for her. I really don't feel like lounging over drinks in Heidi-land. - Just give me the bag. - I don't have the bag. - Where is it? - I left it in her uncle's car. You left it in her uncle's car? God, I don't believe this! - Relax, it's not your problem. - How the hell do you know? - They think we did this together. - Why? Criminals think the worst of people. They think we're in St. Bart's. - St. Bart's? - Well, you'd have already gone. - Is she always like this? - Yes, she don't listen. Her father's going to give us the money. Right? - Her father? You said her uncle. - My father will give it to him. - He gives it to me. Understand? - Your father... - I don't believe this. - Easier than collecting dust. I can't believe you brought her. Thank you. Thank you. She's an alcoholic, too. Wonderful! Drink much? I'll be taking this. I'll get some toothpaste and a room. Yeah, go freshen up. - Do you know what you're doing? - She took your money. You make a great couple. Like Bonnie and Clyde. Emily? How did you know I was here? You can't do business at home with the phone tapped. You had to be in your car, on your plane, or on your boat. You're a very smart girl. You know I have to be overseas tomorrow. Was the timing of this whole fiasco in any way connected with that? - Leave? Your daughter's in peril. - What do you want from me? Uncle Ray ripped off my friend. When he's okay, I'll come home. - Then you can get back to business. - Very well. You have my word. Meet me at the boat tomorrow. When she does come back, there'll be some trouble. I'll look after the police. You take care of the rest. I'll take care of it. - What does your father do? - Businessman. - What does your mother do? - She died when I was three. - I'm sorry about that. - It's all right. - Can you remember her? - No. - Can I ask you a question? - What? What are you running away from? I'm not running away. - I'm trying to get your money back. - Come on... You're running away from something. Why did you get in the trunk? - Oh, we're talking about that. - Yeah, I want to know about that. - I wanted to make my father feel. - Make him feel what? Something. How can I explain 18 years of being unwanted and unwelcome? - I was always a commodity to him. - So you wanted to get even? I always thought that there was no one in the whole world - - who could make me feel like I knew who I was, except for my father. You find yourself. You show yourself who you are. You don't need your father to tell you who you are. Do you know what's the best way to make a dream come true? Do you? Wake up. You'll find... Your eternal mother. You'll find whatever you want. It's true. - Is there any more gin? - We finished the gin. No, we finished the vodka. Maybe under your bed. - Why under my bed? - You hogged 'em all. What have we got? Cognac. I don't want any cognac. I've got a question for you. What do you want in the big picture? I want to open my own chain of karaoke bars down in Brazil. A friend of mine told me there's no karaoke bars in Brazil. - That's a stupid idea. - It ain't stupid. I could be an entrepreneur. You want to make money just so you can make more money? I've had that my whole life, and it doesn't make you happy. It's not about the money, okay? I know what I do is wrong. Believe me, I know. I go home, get your money... Then what do we do? We? If you want to come, after we get that money... I don't want to intrude. I've got my own stuff to do. No, really. If you want to come, you can come. I'm telling you, you can come. I'm not making a pass at you. Check it out. Those guys are fast. - Shut it off, please! - I don't know how to. - Here you go. Happy? - Yes. Listen, don't be telling anyone about the karaoke plan. I've got rum, tequila and rum. What would you like? You don't have to be drunk to kiss me. Well, I'm not drunk. I stained my shirt. I was playing with the hotel pen and it broke. There's postcards in the room. People write on them. Do you like my tummy? It's nice. - Do you like my laugh? - If you smile. - I know you like my car. - We never really got that close. I guess you like me. Let's go and have some breakfast. Get in there. Go. - So you spent the night together? - What do you need her for? Are you kidding? We know who her father is, and he's rich. - Greg knew I'd get the money. - Greg's deadline has passed. - Right, Greg? - I'm sorry! - They gave it to me, too. - Shut up! You want some more? - Do you have to point that at me? - Shut up. You're not stealing cars, she's a human being. Are you on drugs? - Are you? - Calm down, everybody. - Drive the car! - I don't need this for 200 grand. We want a million. You can yell and scream all you want. Great! Keep driving. - We want a million, cash. - All right. Don't be late. This is serious. I'm way out of my league. - Are you leaving? - I'm out of here. First plane. Tell Mr. Dokas those guys took his money and burnt his warehouse. - I'll take care of this. - You've known that girl two days. I know. Make that phone call. Vincent...! Christ! Emily Hope. DOKAS - I'm going to call Dokas. - I'll get the luggage. Wake up, my little princess. Give Mr. Dokas a message. The situation's under control. We've got all his money. I'll call you back to make the final arrangements. - Put me down! - Put her upstairs in the office. - We were expecting Emily. - She's been kidnapped. - They want a million dollars. - I've a distinct sense of deja vu. - She ain't crying wolf this time. - What's your relationship to her? I didn't do what she said I did on the phone, if that's what you mean. - She knows I'm leaving the country. - Sir, you're not listening. They want a million dollars plus the 200,000 he stole from me. They're stupid and dangerous. That's a bad combination. Perhaps, but I've already paid a million dollars once this week - - And I have no intention of going to the well again. It ain't about money. It's about your daughter. Isn't she worth a million dollars? Mr. Perkins will return the money he took from you, not a cent more. Turn your back on me, but don't turn your back on your daughter. You have your money. Now get out of here. I've known this girl for two days. Do I care more about her than you? You son of a bitch! You should've sold her when she was born for cash! This is not the place for that. Come on. Scumbag! - Come on. - Get out of here, man. - I have a plane to catch. - Make sure she's okay first. You make sure she's okay. Put that thing in a paper cup and let's go. - Where is she? - Show me the money. - Watch out. - How do I know you have the money? You're going to have to trust me. I've got to see she's all right. There's a protocol with this. I get the money. You stay here. - Hi, how are you doing? - Good. - How's it going? Who are you? - I'm with Vincent. - He's my friend. - He's my bodyguard. That's a Colt Python with a silencer up your ass. How does it feel, Stick? - Walk. You better tag along. - Did I surprise you? - May I ask you something? - I don't know. Ask me. How could you work for a jerk-off like that? What do you mean? We go back a long way. - You should've looked after her. - I did that, too. It was my job to make sure she could take care of herself. - She's got some ass! - Your mother's got some ass. - What's your name? - Stick. - Stick? Drive. - All right. I'm her uncle. Watch your mouth. Gus? - Hands up. Is he armed? - Hey, your money. Where's the girl? Give me that bag. As I was trying to say, there's a protocol. I check the money. Understand? - That's a nice car. - Stand still and shut up. A million bucks. I've waited a long time for this. - There's no million dollars here! - That's what I owe. - Can't anybody count around here? - That's what I owe. The 500 SL is a beauty, but do I need that kind of horsepower? - Who is this guy? - Her uncle. I trusted you. He took 800,000. He ripped us off, man! - Step up with the girl. - Did you rip us off, man? Did you rip us off? Don't be stupid. - What did I say? What? - Let's get back to business. Did we disturb your shopping spree? Do you like that car? Do you? - That's not right. - What? - I have to see the girl's okay. - We want the money first. - Or do you want half the girl? - You think we're fooling around? Don't do it. It looks like we're about done here. Give me the gun. I know what I'm going to do with you, but what about you? Your father's instructions were not to let you embarrass him. Are you going to kill me? No, he's not. What are you saying? This is for him? No, it's for me. - Hope residence. - Is my father there? - What happened? - We got a trace. 260 Terminal. - Are you all right? - Yeah, I'm okay. She's had a hard time. The kidnappers are tied up inside. Come on. - I guess you don't need me now. - I can always use my friend. I'm only a phone call away. This is damage control. My lawyers will prepare your statement. - I'll tell them I started this. - Why would you want to do that? It's my mess. It's my responsibility to sort things out. - Well, it's good to have you home. - I'm going to be moving out. Emily! As distasteful as it may be to you, you're still my daughter. And I'm still your father. I know. Not bad. How are you doing? I've seen better days. I'm hot. Sit down. I need to decompress. Red wine. Is that for me? 1991... My favourite. You want some? How old are you? Old enough. Oh yeah... what a view! I mean, that's a view. What makes this a view? You. Come on. Come on.
