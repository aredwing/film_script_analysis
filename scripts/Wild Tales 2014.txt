Boarding is through gate 3. Thanks. I'll help you. Fine. Business or pleasure? Both, I hope. What do you do? I'm a model. Sorry, I should have figured. Thank you. Catwalk or advertising? Catwalk. And you, what do you do sir? - You're killing me. - Why? You said "sir" and I sank to the fifth circle of hell. I have to do something about my hair. I'm a music critic. Sounds horrible, I know. It doesn't. Rock? Now you're trying to be nice. Classical music. I see. My first boyfriend was a classical musician. Well, that's what he studied. What's his name? No, he's not famous. He sent in some works back when we were together, but they were never published. Or printed. What's the right word'? Choose whatever term you like and I'll make it popular. Pasternak. Gabriel Pasternak. Pasternak... If I'd known it, I'd have told you I was a gravedigger, not a critic. He submitted his thesis at the Conservatory of Music when I was president of the jury. I ripped him apart. Yes, I was with him at the time. What you did to him was awful. He spent a week in bed after reading the review. Sometimes I have to destroy some poor guy's self- esteem to protect the ears of an entire population. I may be wrong sometimes, but in this case... His work was... a dreadful monstrosity. Are you still in touch with him? We didn't end on great terms. But I'm still fond of him. He was a good guy. Maybe, but if you present a piece like that to a jury there has to be something wrong with you. Gabriel Pasternak! How could I forget him? We laughed about it for months. I'm sorry to interrupt, but I was listening to you. What a huge coincidence! Gabriel Pasternak was my student at Palomar Elementary School. I had to tell him he was being held back. I can assure you: the kid had issues. I've never seen anything like it in 30 years as a teacher. He was screaming and crying like a newborn baby. Miss Leguizamn? Ignacio Fontana. Remember me'? Ignacio Fontana! Unbelievable! There's a cosmic connection here. Wasn't Pasternak one of your classmates? - Are you friends with him? - Intimate friends. Poor guy, we were awful to him. This is beyond unbelievable. I was a manager at Home Depot, where this psycho you mentioned worked for a while. He always had trouble with customers, so we had to let him go. - And when I... - Excuse me. Does anyone else know Gabriel Pasternak? - Me. - Me too. Why? Why are you on this plane? Did you buy your tickets? I'm in real estate, they sent it to me to check out a farm. I have a meeting with the Tourism Secretary. They bought the ticket. I won mine in a raffle. I couldn't change the date. I had to fly today. Gabriel Pasternak is the cabin chief on this flight. We did our training together, we were friends. Then he asked me out and when I refused, he started to get... Never mind. After takeoff, he brought coffee to the cockpit. The door is locked, the pilots won't answer, I'm desperate! I don't know what to do! I cheated on him with his only friend. With him! Gabriel! Gabriel, are you there? It's Victor, Victor Jensen! Talk to me, please! - Who are you? - I was his psychiatrist for years. Then I raised my fees, he got mad and stopped seeing me. Open the door, Gabriel! Listen! It's not your fault! You're just a victim here! I'm telling you, plain and simple: it was your parents who ruined your life! They asked too much of you ever since you were born, they projected all their disappointments on you! They are responsible for your suffering! Gabriel, no one here... has anything to do with it! WILD TALES Good evening. Party of one? I see you're good at math. One, yes. Wherever you like. Today's special is lentils and rice stew. Delicious! Did he order? That guy's from my hometown. He's a loan shark, a gangster. He auctioned our house. Because of him, my father killed himself. Two weeks after the funeral, he tried to seduce my mom. He wouldn't leave her alone so we moved here. You know how many times I dreamed of having him right in front of me? I'm going to say something. Say something? Your dad kills himself because of this guy, and you're just going to insult him? Let's put rat poison in his food. There's some in the storeroom. A good dose and his heart will blow in five minutes. Lots of work? Not with this weather... I've been trying to get your attention for a while. You need to check on your customers, honey. Sorry. Can I take your order? French fries with fried eggs. I'll order something else if I'm still hungry. - To drink? - Diet Coke. Diet Coke? Diet Coke. French fries, fried eggs. Want me to write it? I hate him! Make him French fries with fried eggs. Are you crazy? Want me to go to prison? To prison? Who'll do the autopsy on this jerk? The FBI? French fries with fried eggs. They'll think the cholesterol killed him. Just cook his meal, will you? Can I have your opinion? You seem like a smart girl. Come here. Which do you like better? This one? CUENCA = SAFETY Or this one? The red one. The red one. Hold on. Don't I look too serious? No, I think it's fine. Thank you. Besides, prison's not that bad. It just has bad reputation. They feed you, you don't pay rent, you have nothing to worry about. And if you make nice friends, you can have a good time. You play cards... Were you in prison? A While. And I felt freer in there than here. This is shit. What did you do? Nothing I regret. And he's running for mayor! That son of a bitch. Can you believe it? Of course I can. Bastards rule the world. Wake up, kid! $0? Shall we do the community a favor? Great! You did it. Don't play naive, as if you hadn't noticed. What? That's our country. Everyone wants these guys to get what they deserve, but no one is willing to lift a finger. Be proud, kid. For once in your miserable life, you're doing something worthwhile. - I'm not doing anything. - You're not? You stay here arguing instead of taking the food away from him. Relax. You have nothing to worry about. If there's an investigation, I'll say I used rat poison in the kitchen because we were infested, which is true, by the way, and some of it, accidentally fell into a pot. What will they say? This is insane. Could this shit be expired? There's no expiration date. How does it work? If rat poison is expired, is it more or less harmful? - Everything OK? - Yes. Have a seat. - What are you having, Alexis? - Fanta, maybe? - Should I warm it up? - No! Leave it. If I need you to warm it up, I'll ask. Can I have a Fanta, please? I've had it with this girl. We have to do something, they're both eating. - Add more poison? - He's just a kid! But he'll grow up. Like father, like son. We'd better wipe out the whole family tree. I'm feeling a bit... What's wrong? Are you OK? This must be freezing cold. No, stop! Who the fuck taught you how to wait tables? Leave. You goddamned fucking bitch! Stop it, dad! Pick everything up. Pick it up, I said. Call an ambulance! Pick them up, one by one! Take this! Take this, you thug! I'll gut you like a chicken! Come on, moron, move over. What's your problem? What a piece of shit! You motherfucking redneck! Asshole! Holy Jesus. I can't believe it. Hello. I'm at Kilometer 60 on the route between Salta and... Yes, sorry. UIA719. Diego lturralde. Fine. I was saying, I have a flat tire, at Kilometer 6O on the route between Salta and Cafayate. I'd like to know, how quick can you get here? See, the car's new and I'm not handy with the jack. What's wrong? Did you get scared? Come on, man, drive on. Keep driving, come on! Let it go, I don't want a fight. If I offended you, I apologize. I'm sorry if I did. Are you done? Are you finished? Careful with... What are you... Stop! Come on, man, I didn't do anything. What was it you called me back there? Oh God! I already apologized. What more do you want? I'll get out of the car if I have to, but I don't think it's necessary. Fuck! Stop! Good morning, officer. I'm at Kilometer 60 of the route between Salta and Cafayate and I'm being attacked by a man. It's shatterproof, you won't break it! You pussy! The man's license plate is... I can't see it, can you send a patrol car, please? Perfect. Hurry, he's out of control! I'm sure they'll be here any minute. Give it a rest, man! You wrecked my car! Get lost! What are you doing? Son of a bitch! You son of a bitch! Fucking bastard! Motherfucker! Please! Pussy! What are you doing? Stop, you prick! You're dead! I have your license plate, you son of a bitch! Did you hear me? I have your license plate! UIA! I'll hunt you down and kill you! Resetting... Attention, dispatch. Truck 29 here. Confirm location, please? Dispatch, dispatch! What's your theory, sheriff? Crime of passion? How's it going outside? Ready to go, Simn. Thank you. Let's do it. Attention, we're detonating! Five, four... Good job. There, please. Sign. Yes,honey? I'll stop by the office, make a few calls and be on my way. I'll be there at 5 with the cake. I'll be there on time, don't worry. I hope she likes it. Yes, she'll love it. Thank you. That's 360 pesos. What is it, imported'? One, two... Do you have a receipt? Yes, we've got cakes, pastries... A sales slip, a receipt. Yes, sure, I'll get it for you. You gang of thieves! Next! Hello. I parked my car... Car registration, please. - I don't like that tone. - I'm being polite, sir. I don't think so. The towing fee is 490 pesos and the parking ticket will be sent to your address. But I'm trying to explain. The curb wasn't painted yellow, there was no way I could have known it was a no-parking zone. I understand. If you want to get your car back, you have to pay the towing fee. Then you can file a complaint Monday to Friday, 8 to 2 pm, at the DMV, Carlos Pellegrini 211, 1st floor. Let's do something else. Go and talk to whoever you need to, I want to leave with my car without paying a penny, I want a refund for the cab and I want an apology. Why are you laughing? I'm serious. Where is the office where apologies are made? We're all in the same boat. Please hurry up. The parking ticket indicates you committed an infraction, we don't need further proof. Once again, if you want your oar back, you need to pay. Otherwise, please leave so I can go on working. If I don't have cash? We accept credit and debit cards, or come back tomorrow, but you'll be charged parking fee. - You know you're a criminal? - I'm doing my job. People who work for criminals are criminals too. Right. That's your opinion. Just a miserable slave to this corrupt system. Thank you, have a nice day. Almost there Don't bother. Almost everyone's gone Happy birthday, Camila Happy birthday, precious. Can't we do it again? Forget about it, Simn. Hello, baby, happy birthday. Here's the cake. Hello, kids. Hi, Antonio, how are you? HeHo,dean - How are you? - Fine. We were just leaving. I'm the father. I'll see you out. Why not get a cab and pick up the car later? You missed your daughter's birthday! You make it sound so easy. I'm tired of being robbed! The curb was not painted yellow! Do you have any idea how furious that makes me? Do you have any idea how furious it makes me that you always have an excuse? That you blame society for everything? Today was the tow truck, yesterday was traffic, tomorrow it'll be the rally. The truth is you could have left earlier. You could have helped me set up and have been here to welcome your daughter's friends. But everything else is a priority except your family. And I'm such a fool to think one day you'll change. But you know what? Society won't change. You won't change. And I'm tired. What's that supposed to mean? You're the engineer. Do the math. The government allows a company to rake in the big bucks from these fines. Obviously, our elected officials get their cut. It's outrageous, but that's how it is. You have two options: pay and relax or you give yourself a heart attack. You know what? I have plenty to live for. I want to sail, travel around the world with my grandchildren... - Don't get so upset. - Right. Take it easy. Good morning. I got this ticket. I already paid the towing fee, but there's been a mistake, the curb wasn't painted yellow. - May I? - Sure. It's 560 pesos. Listen, I'm a bit anxious about this, so please, hear me out. The curb wasn't painted. I think you should send someone to the address of the infraction so you can check I'm right. Then, on behalf of the city government, you should apologize, because I'm right, you should give me back the towing fees and compensate me for all the time I'm wasting. According to the ticket, your car was in a no-parking zone. That's proof enough. The fine is 560 pesos and you have to pay it either way. If you don't, interests will start accumulating. Are you listening? Proof enough my ass! I'm telling you the curb was not painted yellow. First, don't insult me. I'm doing my job. Second, you should know how the law works. The fact that you don't know it doesn't mean you can avoid the consequences for breaking it. If you kill someone and say: "I didn't know I couldn't do that," YOU go to jail. Maybe no one told you that, but you'll go to jail anyway. Get the picture? That example is pretty inaccurate. I'm supposed to know by heart where I am not allowed to park, whether the spaces are marked or not'? Exactly. That information is available on the DMV website. I see. - Can you call your superior? - There are none. Really? What are you? The fucking president? Sir, there's a lot of people here. If you're not going to pay, please step aside. How does it feel to be a crook? Tell me. Security, window 7! Security? Great! I'm submitting a complaint, exercising my rights as a citizen, that makes me a criminal? Want to call security? Call security! Go ahead! Call them now! Do it! What are you doing? Get off me! Sign here, please. - Hey, buddy. - How are you? They didn't rape you, did they? This is unbelievable. This is really... unbelievable. It's crazy. Seijas sent the company lawyer to take care of everything. Finally some goodwill, because lately... Maybe that's not the right word... Your name is all over the news, along with the company's name. Seijas's partners aren't too happy. The city government is one of our biggest clients. They're letting you go, Simn. It's been decided. You're currently unemployed, Mr. Fischer. Why, is that a crime? I never said that. But it sounded like that's what you were implying. It's not a crime, but it is a problem when you have to provide for your family every month. She's referring to child support, which includes clothing, tuition, medical insurance. Excuse me. I've supported my wife year round ever since I met her. And my daughter will always have what she needs. If I have a problem, don't worry, I'll work it out. Fortunately my client is now working, so we don't see why Mr. Fischer should have shared custody. Excuse me. I've been paying for everything for years. Just because this month she's employed and I'm not, I don't have the right to joint custody of our daughter? I hope the judge realizes how unfair this situation is. What the judge will realize is how violent you are when you refer to your wife... What violence? I'm describing reality, where do you see violence? I see violence all over the place, Mr. Fischer. I see violence on the streets, when I turn on the TV. And I see violence in this newspaper article. I'm convinced that less contact a child has with this kind of event, the better it'll be for her well-being. Victoria, do you want to take my daughter away from me'? No, I don't want to take your daughter away from you. What's wrong? Are you going crazy? My client and I are finished here, we'll see each other again in court. You're not going to say anything? Are you working for her? - Get a therapist, Mr. Fischer. - What? It's from the heart. I'll talk to you later, someone's here. A kiss. Hello. I'm Simn Fischer, I spoke with Mr. Ederer's secretary. I'm supposed to leave my CV. Sure, I'll give it to her. I'd rather give it to her personally, and if Mr. Ederer's here, I'd like to have a word with him. I worked for over ten years at Seijas Raffo Martinez and Associates. I'm not a rookie. The engineer is on a construction site. And his secretary? She's out for lunch. It's 4 pm. I don't handle her schedule. You know what? I won't leave a damn thing. You can all go fuck yourselves: you, Ederer and his secretary. Especially his secretary. Go fuck yourselves. Lunch at 4 pm? They must think I'm an idiot! The blue Chevrolet? You're rude. This is a fascist regime. I have to pay first and complain later? Exactly. You won't stop until a tragedy occurs. "An act of terrorism," according to the official version. The defense claims it was an accident. "The engineer worked with explosives, "and the tow truck movement caused the explosion." The prosecutor responds: "The fact there were no victims proves the engineer "meticulously calculated the explosion range." This is the 4th time my car's been towed. Help me Dynamite! Please Dynamite: Blow up the tax office! Insurance company refuses to pay: "The tow truck company's responsible for the damages." There are questions about the tow truck company's concession. On social networks, thousands demand the release of the engineer known as "Dynamite." Thank you. Happy birthday, Dynamite... Dad. What happened? What happened, Santiago? Say something! Promise me he won't go to jail. We'll do everything we can. We reiterate: right on Libertador Avenue, a driver struck a pregnant woman and drove off. The driver did not stop to help the victim... Santiago, tell me the truth. Were you drinking? Did you smoke pot'? The eye witnesses couldn't identify the car brand nor the license plate. As we speak, the police is analyzing security camera footage in order to identify the vehicle's owner. Hit and run. Another murderer behind the wheel... Who's the car registered to? It's in my name. - And this is the registered address? - Yes. What have I done? What have you done'? You ruined our life, you asshole! Help him, Mauricio, please! Get him out. Santiago, listen, I need to ask you some questions. Look at me. Was anyone else in the car? Did you tell anyone what happened? No. Let's take a look at the car. The windows are tinted. Were they closed? I think so. - Try to remember. - Yes. Did you get out of the car to see what happened or did you keep driving? I kept driving. Where were you coming from? A bar downtown. Did anyone see you arrive or leave in the car? Your friends, a girl? I swear I can't remember. Unfortunately, we have just been informed that in the ambulance heading to the hospital both the woman and her unborn child passed away. Police is still gathering information through footage from security cameras and interrogating witnesses... - Thank you, ma'am. - You're welcome. I'm really embarrassed to have to make this proposition... but we've known each other for years and I feel we have this kind of bond. Besides, you're a father, I know you want the best for your kids... So I think this arrangement may be good for you too. If you say you took the car for a drive last night while we were sleeping... and that you were driving at the time of the accident, I'll hire the best lawyer to get you the shortest sentence possible... With good behavior, you'll be out in a year and a half. - Is that right? - That's right. Good. And for doing me that huge favor, I'll pay you 500,000 dollars. You wouldn't earn that in a lifetime. And your family will be set for life. You know Santiago... He wouldn't survive in prison. He couldn't stand it. Jos. Please, sit in the car. Grab the wheel with both hands. Touch it everywhere. Good. You'd had some whiskey. Your bosses were sleeping. As you parked the car, like every night, you felt like going for a ride. If they'd asked, you'd have said the tires needed air. Then you bumped into something and you can't remember anything after that until you woke up in here. Jos, I can't thank you enough. Don't touch him, please. It's alright, ma'am. Excuse me. I've been thinking and... I don't know... I'd like to discuss it with my wife. She can't know about it. At least not now. We can't take the risk. What if she talks'? Think about it. You end up with no deal and you'd go to prison for perjury. Fine. Honey... Well, then. You two take my van and go to the country house. When you drive by a toll booth, look down. Don't stop at gas stations, if you want to buy something, pay cash, don't use your credit card. Come on. Let's go! Get in the car again, please. He should sit in the back. Bring the seat forward. You two go upstairs and go to sleep. You don't know anything, okay? You calm down and keep quiet. I'll take care of this. That's okay. - Mauricio Pereyra? - I'm his attorney. I was about to call the police. Come in, please. Such an awful tragedy! An hour ago, my client heard noises downstairs. He thought someone had broken in. He went into the garage and found the groundskeeper sitting in his car, drunk, in a state of shock. Then he heard the news, he put two and two together and he called me. Mauricio Pereyra, this is the prosecutor on duty. And this is Jos. He's worked for the family for what? 15 years? Now we're going to speak to the victim's husband. The father of the unborn child... Sir, what do you have to say? What do I have to say? What do you think? Turn that off, it's not necessary. I've got one thing to say. Whoever did this is going to pay. Are you listening? No matter where you hide, I'm going to... Very well. What happened, Jos? Excuse me. Jos, you have the right to remain silent. I'll be representing Mr. Torres at my client's request. He has never had any trouble with the law and he's the father of two. Can you tell me about the accident? I always park Mr. Mauricio's car. I wanted to take the new one for a ride, to take the Beemer for a spin. And last night... I'd been drinking. And I went for it. I never thought something like this could happen. I went down Libertador Avenue and I sped up. I was driving really fast. And I bumped into something, I couldn't tell what it was. It was a blur. I thought it was a dog. I heard a loud thud... And I got scared because I thought I'd dented the car. I wanted to return and try to fix it before Mr. Mauricio woke up. May I? Jose, can you please sit in the driver's seat? - Should I touch it? - Yes, grab the wheel. Sit back. Could you shut the door? Do you use the rear view mirrors when you drive? The mirrors? Yes, of course I do. Because in this position, you can only see the roof. It's a miracle you only ran over one person. They must have moved during the crash. All at the same time? Yes... I think this car was driven by someone much taller than you. Does anyone else live in the house? My wife, my son... my dog. No need to wake up the dog, but I'd like to meet your wife and son. Sure, no problem. We'll ask them to come down. Do I have your permission to start negotiating? Is it that bad? No, everything's fine. He's willing to make a deal, but it's going to be expensive. How expensive? One million. Dollars? He saw your house, the way you live. He won't take less than that. The good news is he'll take care of everything. He knows the police chief, most of the judges and he'll help us reinforce the alibi. The groundskeeper's? Can't we leave him out? Somebody's got to be responsible. Two people are dead, it was all over the news. Fine, but I don't know if I have that much cash. It's 1.5 million dollars! And there's my cut too. Your cut? Of course. I'm the one negotiating all this. I pay your firm a fortune every year! This is different. These are not fees. I'm putting my name on the line. I was about to lend you my oar so your wife and son could make a getaway. You're not being fair. How much are we talking about? I don't know. Half a million? Look, if you'd like to call another lawyer, that's fine by me, my work ends here. Go and close the deal. Is everything okay, Jos? Well, not really. Why not? For going to prison, I'm getting the same as your lawyer? I know I'm poor, but... - What you're doing is awful. - Awful? Then you go to prison. Last night I watched a Western, had a cup of tea and went to bed early. What else do you want, Jos? Be clear, time is running out. The money we agreed on... and an apartment 'm Mar de m. Mauricio, Jos. Can we all talk? Justice, justice! Let's get to the point, gentlemen, time is of the essence, there's no room for misunderstandings. The story stays the same. I'm going to need you and your family to testify, so no one leaves town. You'll leave the house in cuffs, with a hood on. Outside there'll be press and angry people, they'll ask you questions, call you names, don't say a word. We avoid controversy, let the trial move along, get a conviction and everyone's happy. Stop, mom! It's my life! He wants to go out there and confess... It's the right thing to do! Say something, he has no idea what he's doing! Santiago, calm down... Your mom is right, we'll fix this. Can you shut the door and take care of Santiago, please? Let's go! Cam down, San. Can we proceed? From now on, you'll be the middle man. I won't talk to Mr. Pereyra again until he testifies in court. And you, Jos, avoid talking to anyone except your lawyer. Perfect. I'll need some cash for operational expenses, let's say 30,000 dollars. I'll need it first thing on Monday. Just one question. What do you mean by operational expenses? There are officers outside, the police chief is there. If someone saw or heard anything, we need to cut them in. We have to avoid loose ends. So if you're OK... You'll have the money on Monday, but it's coming out of the budget we agreed on, I won't pay one more penny. - Mauricio, please. - Yes, please... That's what I say. Please! I know I'm in a rough spot, but I won't be gutted like this. What the prosecutor is saying is reasonable. Let's not argue over 30,000 dollars. You pay it then. Take it out of your share. Gentlemen, there's no time for arguing. If you want to proceed we have to do it now. Then you Pa)! it- You're getting 1 million dollars and you want an extra 30,000 for contingencies? Who's getting a million? He's right. The million includes contingencies. Your cut plus the 30,000 add up to a million dollars. Don't touch my cut. You know what, guys? It's over. The deal is off. What do you mean it's off'? It's off! It's over! No one gets anything! No more! Santiago! You said you wanted to confess? That's perfect. Go out there and talk. I gave you the best education and you always did whatever you wanted. So now, go screw yourself! Calm down. Can we be reasonable? What happened? They're all vultures! That's what happened! But it's over. I didn't kill anyone! ...the house of the alleged murderer right here in San Isidro. This morning there was an accident on Libertador Avenue... Open the door. I have something important to tell you. Can we talk in a civilized manner'? What? It's settled, we have an agreement. The 30,000 dollars will come out of everyone's share. I don't want to hear about it! It's over! Get out of my house! Let me remind you two people are dead. If Santiago is found guilty, it will cost us much more. Jos, on the other hand, is penniless. Right, so who will compensate the victim's family? The money should go to them, that's the right thing to do. That scumbag earns a salary that comes out of my taxes? He should investigate what happened! You want to represent my son? Discuss your fees with him! If he can pay, it's between you two. Do what you have to do! Do your job! We had a deal, it's not honorable to back out. I'm sorry if I offended you, but I've always defended your family's interests. I thank you with all my heart! You're an angel! Can I talk to them to see if I can improve the terms? Excuse me. Listen, I think we have a better deal to offer you. Jos takes the initial 500,000 and says forget about the apartment on the beach. The prosecutor and I split the million. Not one penny more. But we have to do it now, Mauricio. The press is outside and the prosecutor needs to let the police chief into the house. No! I'll put up a total of one million and you split it any way you want. - What do you mean, one million? - Take it or leave it! If you don't like it, get lost! You come back here with any other proposal and I'll press charges against you for extortion. Against you and the prosecutor! Prosecutor, can you reveal the identity of the suspect? I can't give any details right now, but the case is virtually closed. There's only one suspect and I'm about to present the brief to the judge. Thank you. Justice, justice! Watch out! Always showing some skin, Bocha! And now... it's time we all stand up and give a big hand to welcome our dear... Romina and Ariel! Let me hug my father-in-law! Take good care of her. I'll be watching. Thank you! I gave him a few good tips... Long live the newly weds! Everyone look this way. A big smile! Thank you very much. Thanks! Thank you. Enjoy. Romina. This is a little something for you. You shouldn't have. You being here is gift enough. Are you having a good time? Lovely. You're so beautiful! Your family is so nice. Too bad this country is so unsafe. Roni's wallet was stolen last night and he didn't even realize it. That's horrible! How awful! Yes, things are bad now, but little by little... So many beautiful people. All friends of yours? Well, those are our friends from the country club. We hadn't seen each other since we were 13, but with Facebook and all, we got back in touch. Facebook! Those back there are my college friends with their boyfriends. Well, the ones who have boyfriends. Those are... Ariel's co-workers... Are you having a good time? - Yes. Are you? - Good... Your typical wedding. You're something, you know? Enjoy. You too. Do you know any good place for us to learn the tango? Yes! No... Not me. But I know my cousin would. I'll introduce you. Fuck! I don't... What is it? No more wine for you. No, don't do that. Act like you're talking to me. Ariel, who's that girl with the long hair? Which one? That one over there. Your co-worker. Lourdes. Why? No reason. And how does Lourdes know your guitar teacher? My guitar teacher? A few months ago someone called your phone when I answered, they hung up. You said it was your guitar teacher. It seemed weird, so I saved the number. And now I call and Lourdes picks up. I don't know what you're talking about. You don't know? With all the cell phone companies and special deals out there, this girl just happened to buy your guitar teacher's phone line? Especially if you never introduced them. Isn't it an amazing coincidence? - So? - What? Answer me or I'll ask her myself. - Romi, please, don't. - Don't "Romi" me! Answer my question! Ariel, does everyone at table 27 know that you fucked that girl? Did you invite all those jerks to our wedding? How could you? I'm sorry to interrupt. May I have this dance with the prince? Of course, my queen. Here's your prince. What happened? Nothing. Romi, are you okay? What is it? Just a moment. Bocha, can I have a minute? Honey. Baby, stop it. Let's enjoy our wedding. Did you sleep with that girl? Please, tell me the truth, I need to know. Yes, baby. But it didn't mean anything to me, I swear. Romi, please, let's not make a scene here. - It was a mistake. - Let me go! I'm sorry! Really, I made a mistake. I want to be alone! What was that? - Did you see her? - You're asking me'? Everything Okay? Shall I get somebody? Are you all right'? Clearly you're not all right. Calm down. What happened? I just found out my husband cheated on me with one of our wedding guests. That's awful. And now I don't know what to do with all those people down there. Calm down, these things happen... Time heals all wounds. Here. If you love him, you'll be able to forgive him. - If he's the one for you... - I don't know if I love him! I don't know if he's the one for me... He's an asshole! Well, then... To hell with him. And don't worry about the guests, you're not the first woman at that party to be cheated on. Plus, if you spend your time worrying about what other people think you're screwed, kiddo. All better? Look... If I were you, I'd go downstairs, move the party along, end it early, and then, back at home, tell him it's over. What happened to you is awful, I won't deny it. But you have to move on. Better? Romina? Get the hell out of here! Don't say a word! You don't know who you're messing with! I'll take every penny you have, every property your dad put in your name to get around taxes will be mine. We are married. Legally married. I'll spend all my days sleeping with any man who looks my way anyone who gives me an ounce of love. And when it's you who wants the divorce, I'll take acting lessons so I can stand before the judge like a sad little puppy and tell him I'm fighting to make this work, that way our marriage will last forever. I'll post all your secrets on Facebook! I'll torture you until you scream with pain. You'll be so humiliated that your only way out will be jumping off a bridge. And then, when death do us part, when your death do us part, I'll have it all. Ariel, calm down. Come on, buddy. Where the hell have you been? Stop! Put me down! Put me down, assholes! Gustavo, tell them to let me down! Something is wrong! Can't you get them to put me down! I'm telling them! Marianito! Turco! Careful, boys. Goddamn it, Comanche! Stop it! Assholes! Assholes! Leaving already? No, no, stay. We worked it out. Really, don't worry, come with me. Stop, I'm getting dizzy! Relax, this is great! Stop it, please! Did you ever go to that amusement park? The one they closed down because the rollercoaster flew off the... Call a doctor! ...and she threatened to take every last dime, even all his properties... - We're taking her home... - Yes, that'd be the best. I'm very sorry about this. It was still a wonderful party. Excuse me, please. Most of the cuts are superficial, they'll heal quickly. But we'll take her in just to make sure that no tendons are torn. Does she have good medical insurance? Romina, please, go back inside. I'm just asking about her insurance. Great. Stay there. I'm fine. Romi, dear, are you okay? - Are you sure? - Yes, don't worry. Relax. Why don't we use this break to cut the cake? Come on, girls, don't leave me hanging here. Come on, girls. It's been a terrible night, but now I want to relax and enjoy my wedding. I don't think I'll get married again. Now! Romi! Mili, you got it! I can't believe it! A picture with Mili! Wouldn't you like to marry Mili? Come on! All the rest may be bullshit, but let's prove the ring tradition comes true! Wouldn't that be great? Stop, Romi. Kiss... We should do the garters, toss the bouquet... Do you want to continue or call this off? We're calling it off. We're calling it off. But why? You're such a party pooper! Girls, here it goes! Besides, we still haven't had the hot pastrami. Boy, that was expensive! Ariel, tell them. We spent a whole week arguing about the pastrami. We decided on it, we paid for it, and now I want some. Romina! Stop it! Let everyone go home. This isn't a joke. My family's lawyer even suggested I press charges against you. Don't tell me this is all mommy's idea. Cut it out, Romina! Your mom is a real... wedding planner. Stop it! What did I do to you? It was nothing compared to what you're doing to me! Son, please, calm down. Please. God... Shoot this, Nestor. Nestor, turn the camera on. You too, get over here. Shoot this, please. If I get married again... If I ever find a guy who's worth it... I'm going to show this video at our wedding! I'll even watch this with my kids. Instead of Dora the Explorer and all that crap, I'll play this video. I know! I'll put it on one of those digital picture frames that play photos in a loop! Get off my daughter, bitch. Stay out or it's hell! I was going to help you, Bocha. (Luca, some here. Honey, are you all right? Doctor! You take care of her, you take him. What is he on? Nothing, he had an emotional shock. No drugs here... Can you walk? What's the name of the bride? Romina... I need you to sit down so I can take your blood pressure. A chair, Mauro! Sit down. Take his jacket off, please. Can you sit down? Are you okay? Relax, Romi, relax. Can you get her some water'? Easy, Romi. You just need to rest. Wait, Ariel. Calm down. It's fine. Nothing happened. We are all right. Okay? Relax. No, Ariel! Easy. To my father
