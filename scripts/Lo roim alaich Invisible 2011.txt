If you want to go on editing the film, it's okay. Are you sure? - Sure. - Thank you. Michel? Who is she? I'm not sure. Maybe one of the activists. I have a meeting with this group tomorrow. Where do I know her from? Bye, Nira. Bye. I'm glad you made me come. I haven't been in nature for years. Go home! Get out of here! Move it! Go home! This is my land. Everyone, move away! I'll translate in a moment. Let the Palestinians pick their olives in peace. Why don't you arrest them? Lady, get back, or we'll arrest all of you. Do something before someone gets hurts! We have orders not to hurt Jews. You have no such orders. Shall I read your orders? You're traitors! This is a closed military zone! I'm asking you to leave. Go home! You have to protect the Palestinians. Get her laid, to calm her down! Thank you. - See you. - Bye. Bye. Thank you. - Bye. Nira? I'm sorry they threw you out, but thank you for this experience. It was important that you filmed it. Thanks. Excuse me? Excuse me if I... I may be completely wrong, but... I think we've met before. More than 20 years ago. Lily, what's happening next time? What we discussed. We'll be in Jayus next Saturday, I have to talk to Nabil, I still have to wait for permits. I hope I'm not bothering you. I didn't remember that lineup until I saw you today. I haven't thought about it for so long and suddenly I remembered. I walked out of that lineup, and saw you, standing at the entrance to the police. Alone. You stood straight and had a braid. When did they catch him? I have no idea. I get mixed up because my father died at the same time, but... Looking at you, the signs are invisible. But are they really visible on anyone? You're so... I'm sorry for landing on you like this. Do you think he's still in prison? - I don't know. I'm glad you came. Thank you. It was nice meeting you. - Nice meeting you. Nira. Bye, good night. "The Polite Rapist" Leave it, Lily, I'll do it later. It's okay. How are you? - Great. How was it for you? Great. A little short. We've never been apart for a whole month. I couldn't fall asleep last night. But was it good for you? Was is good I didn't come? Were you able to write? - Lily, I'm not a robot. After 20 years it doesn't switch on and start working. Did you miss me? Of course. What's this? It's for you. Thank you. What a pesky daughter I have. Wait a minute, sweetheart. Yes? Hello? - Hi. It's me, Nira. Hi. Meeting you really affected me, you know? Do you have a minute? Yes... yes. Everything suddenly came back to me. I didn't remember that my father died after they caught him. I shouldn't have told my father. That's what killed him. It can't be your fault. That whole period is so mixed up for me, it's one big muddle. I have to... I'm sorry, Nira, but... - I have to find out what happened, I've got to run. Of course, when can I call you? I'm at the studio all day. Oh, you're a dance teacher? At "Studio A." - Oh, I know the studio. I really have to go. - Yes, I'm sorry. Move your arm away. Like a Palestinian presenting his ID card at a checkpoint. At Surda checkpoint, the soldiers divided the Palestinian women into two lines- pretty and ugly ones. They stood there in two lines, waiting to pass through. - Come on, Lily, enough politics. Lily, when do we do the other arm? Where have you been these past days? With all your spare time, I never see you. I don't know, around and about, looking for stuff to write about. We don't get to talk. I wanted to tell you... Are you listening? - Yeah. A few days ago I met... a woman who was also raped by the Polite Rapist. It made me think of how you were with me then. How we loved each other, how you loved me. I'll never forget your being with me then. What are you doing, Lily? Why are you bringing this up? What good will it do you? What do you mean? Amnon, talk to me. "6th Rape Carried Out Near the Ayalon Bridge" Hello. Is this the police records section? I'm looking for a testimony I gave. What about? - Rape. Lahav! - Yeah? There's someone here looking for a rape file. Did they get him? How can I help you? I'm Nira Meirovitch and I'm looking for a testimony I gave here. When? - April, 1977. Oh. Then it's been burned. Anything before 1985 has been burned. "Burned"? What do you mean, "burned"? We can't keep every file. Can I find out if he's still in prison? It was... a serial rapist. The Polite Rapist. The Gentle Rapist. You know how many rape cases we have? I can't believe you destroyed my file. Let's try his ID number. Do you have it? I didn't ask for his ID when he raped me. Our computer works on ID numbers. What can I do? You know what? Hang on. Why are you doing this after so many years? This is Dr. David Giladi. He's head of the forensic lab, he worked here back then. He immediately remembered the case of the Polite Rapist... Hello. - Hello. I remember you. You... were beautiful. I interviewed you. - I don't know. I was thinner then, and I had a beard. Have a seat. - No, thanks. I had just joined the police at the time. That bastard was driving us crazy, raping someone every few days. Two months later, I interviewed a little Yemenite woman who said that... during the... act, he told her to stroke his back. When she stroked him, she felt a small mole on the lower right side of his back. He wanted you to stroke him so the intercourse would seem romantic, right? That's why we named him "The Polite Rapist..." So when exactly did you interview me? Another psychologist and I interviewed all the girls. Actually... I remember something from your interview. You said that you weren't a virgin. There's something else I remember. You said he had a thick sexual organ. Not large, but thick. Ah, Nira. Hi. - Hi. What did you? I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Did I burn you? No, no. - I'm sorry. Michel, I'm sorry. - No, no, it's me, it's me. Excuse me. - It's my fault. Maybe you should take it off. Yes. - Excuse... It's me, it's me. Hey, get your hands off her! Hey, get your hands off her! Let me do the job! Get outta here! Hey! Sweetheart. This is great. I didn't know you were coming. How long can you stay? - Just for a bit. Come, I'm going out. - I'm coming. How long are you staying? They gave us a short leave. I won't see you... Hello? What? No... She's not home. I'm Yuval, her son. What? Oh... Okay, thanks. Yeah, I'll tell her. Cool, bye. Nabil can't get a hold of you. What does he want? He said, "Bravo for not enlisting." What? If you lie about me being a conscientious objector, at least tell me about it. Fuck. Yuval! That's not exactly what I said, Yuval. Mom, you won't believe... - Just a sec, sweetie. Yuval... Dana, honey... I just blew it with Yuval. You're so... impossible to talk to. Why? What? Never mind. - What, Dana? What happened? Just before, on Gvirol Street... At the ATM, on my way home, three guys come up behind me... - When's Dad coming? Oh, Dana, you're here too. - No, I'm not here. You're starting up too? What's her problem? - Hang on, sweetie. Yuval. I've had it! - Yuval! Three guys are behind me... Mom, you're not listening to me! I'm listening, Danush. Go on. I'm at the ATM. These three guys are behind me. So I say, "Give me some space here." Suddenly, one grabs me from behind... Yeah? I let out a scream, they disappeared, but... I don't know what could've... Mom? Are you listening to me? Are you all right? Is she okay? Should we call someone? - I'm okay. Do you need help getting up? - Do you need anything? Let's help her up. Call an ambulance. - I don't need an ambulance. Are you okay? Let us help you. - I'm fine. Do you want some water? Lily? Sure you're okay? I'm fine, I'm fine. Are you sure? We... Take care. What happened? Did you fall? Did you fall down all these stairs? Yes. I'm okay. The day after the rape, I went to see my mother. I said to her, "Mom, "yesterday a man choked me and raped me for hours in a field." She was about to go out, so she said, "It's best not to talk about it. Leave it." I had that day's paper, I showed her. "College student raped yesterday." And? That was the last time I ever turned to her. Hi, sweetie. Can't Daddy help you? I'll drop by school tomorrow morning, before the bell rings. Okay? Good night. Whenever my daughter is at her dad's, she needs something urgent from me. She just needs to know you're there. I guess so. Have you been separated for long? - From Avri? We never really lived together. We were together for a few months, then Shir was born. Rain. Is your mother still alive? She died 3 years after my dad. I didn't tell my parents at first. I didn't want to worry them. But a year later, I thought it wouldn't be so bad, because I told myself I'd gotten over it. So in honor of my birthday, I told them. My father had a heart attack and died two weeks later. Do you want something to drink? Okay. How about a beer? - Okay. Why did you go to the police? I want to know exactly what happened. Step by step. What about Beit Ariella library? They have all the newspapers from that time. You could find details about what happened. Yes? - Yes. I'm sure... you could find everything you need. After all, they wrote about me. That's what I showed my mother. And the gynecologist. I wanted to check I didn't get any sexual disease. I said in a matter-of-fact way, "I was raped, I want you to examine me." He said, "That's what you call it when you sleep around? I took the newspaper article out, to prove it. So what did he do? He gave me some antibiotics. Shall we go? - Okay. Let's go. "Female police officer among Polite Rapist's victims" "The Polite Rapist attacks again, this time - a college student" "The Polite Rapist" Hey, Lily, honey. We need permits from the Tul Karem checkpoint. Hi, Lily. I saw the article about you in the paper... You've reached the voicemail of 050-5866486... Hi, Lily. I hope you're well. I'm reading in newspapers from back then, they quote a confidential police profile. "The first, a woman of 30, "whom the police didn't think was 'cute'." Then there's a "pretty" social worker. The third case, "a woman of 35, very attractive." I think it's... the religious woman I also met at the lineup. The fourth case. "24 years old, not particularly pretty, frightened". I think they mean me. Although I wasn't 24 and I wasn't frightened. I was angry. I kept asking them to set up an ambush, they wouldn't listen. And then, he raped a 13-year-old girl. Listen. "The rapist chose a 13-year-old girl "to provoke and punish the police." The girl isn't important. She got stuck in a competition between the rapist and the police. Those damn reporters... Impressed by his style. As if it's all sexy. Hi. - Hi. Did you make it for me? Moussaka. - I have to have a bite. It's still hot. What did you want to talk to me about? How are you? Fine. - The usual? What? No, I just... What happened to you... at the ATM, we didn't get a chance to talk. - I screamed, they ran off. That's what you wanted to talk to me about? That too. I wanted to tell you that... what happened to you at the ATM was... It's a good thing they ran away. Also because of all the... There's something I've wanted to tell you... that's... related. Well, what is it? Don't be mad at me. - Well? Actually, it's nothing. It's not important, sweetie. I don't know... - What? What's not important? You tell me to come over, that you have to talk to me, and now it's not important? Yuval and I see what's going on with you and Dad. We aren't little kids. He hardly ever works. Yuval saw him at a cafe giving an enthusiastic lecture. He's looking for his youth. Don't be hard on him. I'm not hard on him, Dana. He's never home. The tension between you depends on you. You know that. You need him to hold your hand? That's not exactly how it is. I'm lucky I'm not like you. Want some zucchini too? - No, thanks. It's really good. Mommy, don't worry. Bye. - Bye, sweetie. Thanks for coming. Don't be upset. Hi, Nira. - Hi, Michel. It came to the cameras' room by mistake, it's from Channel 1. Is it for our film? No, it's for me. Thank you. Nira? Will you have a drink with me after work? Please... Michel, I am sorry, but today I'm really busy with my daughter... OK. - I'm sorry. - I understand. It was 9pm, I was coming from a sculpture class and a man appeared in front of me, ...a big guy, and that was pretty scary, so I started walking fast, and he started running and he attacked me from behind. When I screamed, he choked me. I found myself on the ground, not breathing, my mouth full of soil. Couldn't you run away? - No, he was choking me hard and every time I did something he choked me tighter and said, "If you don't behave, I'll kill you." He was behind you? - Yes, I couldn't see him. Altogether he kept me there for four hours, approximately, I didn't look at my watch, and he raped me for two hours out of the four. What did you do the day after? We went to the Dizengoff Police Station. An officer got me to tell him the entire story and then told me it's not within his responsibilities. He treated me like some nymphomaniac, looking for rape. Otherwise why did I walk alone at night? Good morning, princess. Run to the balcony to see something really nice. Here you go, sweetie. Did you see how the flowers grew? - Yes. Hello. Hi. - Hi. I made it. People might think I'm a political activist. Are they the only ones coming? - Yes. It's a weekday. We're waiting for one more person. I may have a way to contact another woman. Lily, where are we going? We're meeting Fadi at Tapuach Junction. We'll be in the Awarta area. What'll you say: "We're from the same lineup"? I don't know. I'll think of something. You think you have the right to invade her life? I think it would do her good to know there are others. It would do her good? Do you know her? Do you know anything about her? Have I harmed you? I'm sorry. My life right now is... I just can't. Do you want to meet up sometime? I can't deal with it right now, Nira. Do you understand? How long will this take today? Until evening. I didn't know it would take so long. I must be back for my daughter this afternoon. I'm sorry. Do you have a way to get back? - Yes, I'll take the bus. Bye. No, it's fine. Bye. Listen to me. There's been shooting this morning. Make sure to send someone over. I don't know, send someone over. Soldier, don't point your gun! No one is threatening you! Everyone, get over there! Was I not clear? Why are you pointing guns at children? Get over there! Go home, go home! Speak politely. Would you talk that way to me? - I wasn't talking to you. Then don't talk to these people like that. Don't piss me off, come over here! Stop filming Palestinians before I... What? Are you going out? I don't know. Where are you going? - I don't know. Is there someone else? - What? Someone else?! You're with your work, your Palestinians, your injustices. What do you need me for? To be your babysitter? Let me be. Hi, I'm Nira. - Hi. - Thanks for coming. Are you filming this? No, don't worry. I'm just recording. I want to remember all the details. Thank you. Will you start from the beginning? I was 22, a college student. It was about 5pm. I was walking down the path to get a falafel at the shopping center. Suddenly someone grabbed hold of my neck and choked me really hard while covering my mouth. And at that very moment, I have no idea how, but I knew it was rape. All I remember is that I saw, I imagined, a body, my body, naked, white, dead, in the field. But, I hardly remember anything. It was Passover, school was out and... I couldn't be alone for a minute. I couldn't walk down the street or go into stairwells. No, I couldn't... I couldn't function. That's it. What else? Don't leave me. Don't leave me, Amnon. You saved me, Amnon. I don't want to live without you. What do you need me for, Lily? What do you need me for? What's left between us? The kids are grown up. What? What's the point? As always, you're the victim. I want you to go. Be careful, I really will go. Go, go. Is this for me? Thank you. Let's go back to where we left off. I suddenly felt a hard blow. One hand was choking me, I could hardly breathe, then he carried me into the orchard. I kept thinking how I was going to survive. How I was going to live and not die. Yes, I remember it well. I was so scared he would kill me, I was scared he would kill me. When he had the nerve to show me his face, it was already dark. I remember eyes, eyes, eyes all the time. And curly black hair. I see him between my legs, with eyes! Right in front of my eyes. With eyes, eyes, all the time. I say to myself, "I wish this nightmare was over, I wish this nightmare was over." It came back to me later when... I had sex with my partner. I said, "No, this is not going to happen!" I remember the moustache, a moustache. At a certain point, I noticed he had a moustache. Hi. The suspect, 37, accused of rape, is led to the courthouse with chains on his hands and feet. He covers his face with a plastic bag. The judge orders the suspect to be kept in custody. He will be sent for psychiatric evaluation to determine if he is responsible for his acts. The investigation of this case began after the first complaint of a rape that occurred here two years ago. Every night, stakeouts were set up, but the acts of rape continued. Last month, right here, near Shalvata hospital, the suspect was arrested where two rapes occurred. The suspect admitted committing two rapes. identify him in a police lineup. The 37-year-old suspect, a father of three, is charged with... ...16 counts of rape. The maximum punishment for rape is 14 years in prison. Nira? Sorry. No, no, sorry. - I'm so sorry. No, no, it's not that. I never cry. I didn't even cry when my father died. Everything is so complicated. Nothing is working for me. I don't know what I'm doing anymore. I just saw the man who raped me. What?! - No... He raped me a long time ago. I just saw him now on video. He looks so alive. I thought I knew what I'm doing. Bullshit. I didn't think you'd call. I waited a day, two days, but six months? I surprised myself too. This morning I found the note with... ...your number that you gave me in the taxi. Shall we go to a restaurant, a cafe? I also know... a little hotel. It's not the Riviera... I've never been to the Riviera. Coffee at the hotel? Leaving already? I had a really good time. Hello. Hi there. - Hi. Come in. Shir's asleep, let's sit in the kitchen. I didn't think I'd ever see you again. I separated from Amnon. My husband. I told him to leave. - Wow... Would you like some coffee? Tea? How about vodka? Vodka's good. Hold on. All I've got is corn. Is that okay? Great. It's been over with Amnon for a long time. I didn't want to see it. You came in the middle, it wasn't good timing. But you came for a reason. I guess so. Cheers. Cheers. Did he also tell you that... he was in the Yom Kippur War, that the war did it to him? I don't... remember exactly what he did in the war. It was... Let's not talk about the rape... Oh, he said... he was in the Sinai Desert. That he'd had that problem ever since. Did he think that if he pleaded shellshock you'd let him rape you? Lily, come on, let him rot in jail. Forget it. Can I have one? You want a cigarette? - Yes. You started smoking? I want a cigarette. Blow the smoke outside. I had sex. - Really? A one-night stand. It was amazing. For me, sex... is always heartbreak. When I had sex with Avri... after nearly vomiting a few times, he had enough. So did I. - Makes sense. Do you know how many years he got? Thirty. I see you, I'm sorry we're late. Come on. Wait here for me. I have see my friend. I'll be right back. Hi. - Hi. Let me see... - Here. We went to buy some plants. Where is it? - Right here. "After 10 years behind bars, the Polite Rapist is released." How did they let him out after 10 years?! After you left yesterday, I went on the Internet. I found the High Court's ruling for reducing his sentence. Justice Barak said, a woman's body is not expendable, but there are other considerations. What considerations? - Yes. That's only a few months for each case... ...Including the 13-year-old girl? A psychiatrist testified he is no longer a threat, only six months into his sentence! All I could find out about him is illegal renovation charges. Mom! - Can I keep this? Yes. - I'll call you tonight. Bye. I'm coming, Shir. Let's go. - Take these. Lily, On the Internet, settlers are burning Palestinians' trees! I'm watching it too. You're there already? Yes, we just arrived. Oh, okay. I'll see you tonight. Take care. Okay. - Bye. Mom. What are you doing here? I missed you. Are you done? - Yeah, in a minute. Want some ice cream? We've got apple and berries. On one hand, you act like Superwoman, on the other hand, you're a helpless little woman. I'm sorry if I'm hurting you, but... You're not hurting me. Aside from what happened between Dad and me, there are other things. If you're telling me that you cheated on each other, I don't want to hear it. - No. I'm just looking for a... ...way to say it, without it becoming a burden. - Just spit it out. I didn't want to hurt you... I didn't want to tell you, I wanted to protect you. To shield you. I thought that... - Mom, stop making everything so complicated. I was raped... ...a long time ago. I had just met Dad. For years, I tried not to... delve into it, but lately, with all this crisis and... I realize that I can't... ignore it. That it is there. I had a feeling something like that happened to you. All of a sudden I allowed myself to look back at my life and to cry over it, to mourn over it... Who cares what she has to say? We do. You collected these testimonies since we met? Since I went to the police. I kept imagining myself showing it to you. We have to do something with this. Show it. Go public with it. Make a film? Whatever you need... I'll help you. I'll get us some tea. Oh, take a look at this. Let's go back to where we were. You went to the bus station and? Hi. "Court Archives" "Israeli Courts" Only one copier is working. What's going on over there? - I don't know. Have you seen this? What? This is... the documentation of the 16 women who identified him. Are we there too? When were you? - April, 1977. Yes, you're case no. 6. "Near the Arvei Nahal Bridge "the accused attacked no. 6 from behind, "grabbed her by the neck "dragged her... "stripped her forcefully..." I'm case no. 8. "At approximately 8pm, "near the train station in Tel Aviv, "the accused attacked no. 8 from behind. "He grabbed her by the neck and dragged her "to a makeshift bedding he'd prepared in a nearby field. "The accused stripped her forcefully "and penetrated her three times against her will. "He also forcefully committed an indecent assault "by inserting his sexual organ into her mouth." I didn't remember how many times... He didn't really have a hard-on. It kept going soft... That's why he... he kept trying over and over again, this way, that way. And before each time he also choked me and said that he'd kill me. Excuse me, there are other people here! You need the machine? - Yes. We're almost done. I feel like killing. I see the rapist, his stomach and the mole on his back, turning on a spit over a fire. How? Like this. Sideways. Like a bull. Saying how much he enjoys it. It has to be somewhere stately. Rabin Square. But I also see the psychiatrist on a spit. And the policemen, the reporters. And your gynecologist. - And Justice Barak. And the High Court judges. All on spits. But we'll put the judges higher since they're above the people. And the rapist... I'd cut off his dick. - Exactly. In the city square. And us, the women he raped, jumping up and down, dancing wildly around the fire. I see us dancing against the background of the fire. Take a look at the map. Take a right here. This is the street. Not yet... A little further. Here it is. That's the house. It's just a house. Why did we come here? I don't know. To see if the renovations went well. What are you doing? It's for our film. Here, behind that window, lives the Polite Rapist.
