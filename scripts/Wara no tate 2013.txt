The scene is a tree grove in South Matsubaru, block 5. A man named Mamiya, who was walking his dog, called it in. The body is lying face down. Naked from the waist down. Most likely a child, possibly female. Whether she's alive or dead is not confirmed. Guess he's stuck in Unit 4 again. Mekari can live with that. As long as nothing stands in his way SHIELD OF STRAW PLEASE KILL THIS MAN KUNIHIDE KWOMARU, AGE 29. REWARD: 1 BILLION YEN One billion yen? A related incident occurred three months prior. On June 4th, in this drainage ditch in South Matsubaru, in the Setagaya Ward... the corpse of Chika Ninagawa, a female elementary student, was found. From DNA testing of evidence at the scene... Kunihide Kiyomaru was the most likely suspect in the crime. Not that case'? The victim was Chika Ninagawa, aged 7. Shock from brutal assault was the cause of death. it was terrible. Eight years ago, the suspect Kiyomaru assaulted and murdered a young girl. He was just released from prison last October. Usually nabbing a high profile criminal would mean a promotion. A promotion, eh? I'll catch up to you one of these days, Lieutenant Mekari. The suspect is still... On the run. If we can catch him and try him, he should get the death penalty I don't blame the bereaved family for their rage. The victim was Takaoki Ninagawa's granddaughter. The victim was Takaoki Ninagawa's granddaughter. As the bounty ads are believed to be connected, the police await Ninagawa's cooperation, but remain unable to contact Ninagawa, or locate his whereabouts. Ninagawa served as chairman of the JBF and is a financial tycoon. His personal assets are believed to be in excess of 100 billion yen. Why? If that happened to my granddaughter, I'd do the same. Not that. Why this ad in the newspapers? Ads get inspected before going to press. The checking process is repeated many times. The editing department does the final check. Seems the ad was swapped there. PLEASE KILL THIS MAN Seems the ad was swapped there. PLEASE KILL THIS MAN As if all 65 people planned it, REWARD: 1 BILLION YEN As if all 65 people planned it, REWARD: 1 BILLION YEN REWARD: 1 BILLION YEN they all resigned. REWARD: 1 BILLION YEN REWARD: 1 BILLION YEN When questioned as to why, they lawyered up and... When questioned as to why, they lawyered up and... won't cooperate at all. Let me... show you something. Take a seat. My son was on my ass to switch to a smartphone. The Kiyomaru Site. I want you to kill this man, Kunihide Kiyomaru. The man who murdered my seven-year-old granddaughter. As a reward, I'll pay you 1 billion yen. The ISP is located in Columbia, and can't be shut down. I have heart disease... I don't have long to live. Money is merely scraps of paper for a man with no will to live. My terms are: One: anyone found guilty for... attempted murder or murder of Kiyomaru. Multiple parties are allowed. Two... Anyone who kills Kiyomaru by order of the nation. It's not one billion for simply killing Kiyomaru. It covers anyone given a guilty verdict. His premise pays for their crimes. As for "by order of the nation", it's not capital punishment or war, so... we're not sure what he means. Closing this site is impossible. Loan buy anything... except the life of a child. That's all. What's wrong, Mekari? Either way my job is protecting VIPs. You never change. Just don't let Shiraiwa show you up. The pride of Unit 4 rides on you. With a nationwide arrest warrant out, Kiyomaru remains at large... as the police close in. One billion yen to murder a man... We hope no one entertains this offer'... H's me, man. Open up. Mr Famous! Can I get your autograph? You better not go out. Not everyone's a sweet guy like me. Eat up. I got your favourite again. Tanaka... Sorry man. I'm home. Happy birthday No Japanese tea to go with the sweets? Okay honey Mekari speaking. It's Ohki. Kiyomaru turned himself in. Apparently, he was given shelter by a yakuza gang boss that... exploits illegal immigrant Chinese. They met in the joint. The man... tried to kill Kiyomaru. Kiyomaru went to the Fukuoka police and was taken into custody Covered in blood, he probably had nowhere else to go. That advertisement is to blame. Why are you telling me this? Well, Mekari... I need you in Fukuoka tomorrow. You've got 48 hours to transport Kiyomaru to the prosecutors. Get him to Tokyo Metro ASAP This unprecedented exception means us. The Security Police have been assigned. Ready to... be a bullet-proof vest for a lowlife'? Ready Along with our unit, two other officers have been selected. 8 am at HQ tomorrow, got it? An SP firing in the line of duty will make history Besides, we're... the closest to the 1 billion yen. Just kidding. This mission is a shortcut to promotion. Salute! From the crime unit, Agent Okumura and Head Patrol Officer Kanbashi. I'm Okumura. I'm Kanbashi. From the SP unit, meet Lieutenant Mekari... I'm Mekari. And Head Patrol Officer Shiraiwa. I'm Shiraiwa. A Fukuoka police agent will also be on hand. Tokyo Metro is reviewing the means of transport. Chief. In this unprecedented case, there's no telling what will happen. Prepare for all 120 million people in Japan... to be your enemies, and carry out your mission. You're not only guarding a criminal... but also the Japanese police itself. Our national pride is at stake. Don't let him be killed. Bring him back alive, at all costs! Salute. They lack our experience. Don! rely on them. Use them as a shield in an emergency How do you feel about protecting a man like Kiyomaru? If top brass say "protect", then we protect whoever. That's the job. Sucks for you. Taking bullets for a piece of shit like Kiyomaru. If told to protect, we protect whoever. That's our duty I'm under a woman's thumb at home... and now here at work, too! Shiraiwa is highly capable. I'm aware of that. She's top in arrest skills and shooting. A kendo master. Speaks many languages. A candidate for top brass, but... no one's ready to promote a single mom yet. What surprised me most was... you. Sorry but checking up on people is in my blood. Three years ago... your accident? The truck driver, he... Leave my personal life out of it. Want to know why I got assigned? Ask those who chose me. The culprit was hired for 100 million by Ninagawa Governance. Gimme a break. Once again, the man who attempted to kill Kunihide Kiyomaru... has turned himself in to the authorities in Fukuoka. The Kiyomaru Site announced that... Ninagawa Governance hired him under contract for 100 million. 100 million for attempted murder? It's open season on Kiyomaru. Let Kiyomaru out for questioning. Kiyomaru, get out here. They caught Kiyomaru in Fukuoka. For taking a shot at him... you can hit the jackpot. It's nuts! You off to see the media circus, too? Driver, turn up the radio. Sure thing. White in police custody, the suspect Kiyomaru was attacked by a custody officer, and sustained injuries. - Let me go! - Move! He was rushed to hospital and treated for his injuries... Heading there now. Drive to Kyushu Central Hospital. Now a cop tried to kill him? God help us. Tokyo Metro, First Investigation Unit. We're here for Kiyomaru. He's being treated. Wait at the precinct, will you? Where is Kiyomaru? - I said, he's being treated. - So I'm asking: where? Leave this to us, will you? To you clowns? - Like before? - Fuck off. - Kanbashi. Most cops are awaiting orders. Cut out the attitude, will you? Down a notch. Sorry for the trouble. I'm Sekiya, Senior Officer, Fukuoka Police. I'll join the transport mission. Kiyomaru. Metro Police. May I? A warrant for your arrest for the murder of Chika Ninagawa. We'll escort you to Police HQ. Play nice, now. Reckon you can really... protect someone like me? Stop your mumbling... - You fuck. - Are you enough? What? Are five of you enough'? Meaning what? Say that again, asshole! Stop with the cop talk. Scumbag! - What? - Stand down. - Shut up! - Stand down. I... I almost got killed twice! Damn right, I'm worried! You try being a moving target! Why doesn't anyone understand me?! Shut up, asshole! Hands off me! Don't touch me! Keep your dirty hands off me! You make me sick, old man! Don't touch me! We won't. Calm down. You make me sick. Your germs are on me! Keep your hands off me until you see it my way! Relax. Calm down. What?! Nurse, sedative. What the fuck! Hey! They are Tokyo Metro SPs. During the transfer, they'll keep you safe. Rest easy What's in the syringe? Show me that vial in your pocket. Potassium preparation. When injected intravenously it causes hyperkalaemia, then heart failure. From the sublime to the ridiculous. - Our air transport is off. - Meaning? Seems an airline mechanic got arrested. The plane where the device was found was scheduled to be used as transport. The mechanic sabotaged the plane in order to kill Kiyomaru. So... what now? Tax money down the toilet. With this escort, who needs SPs? This displays our overwhelming force, so that's why the NPA chose this method. With five convoy buses, nobody knows which one Kiyomaru's in. The bosses have no idea of what our biggest threat is. They couldn't close the outbound, but are checking cars. We're safe. And it's better than being shot at. That's not what I meant. Citizens trying to kill Kiyomaru don't scare me... Getting weapons would be heard, and they aren't trained. The scariest thing is... a trained man with a weapon. A cop. The bosses gave 350 armed cops a chance at 1 billion yen. You laughed, right? For a guy who almost got whacked, you're a little too relaxed. Don't blow me off, pervert! Scum like you should be crying for fear of death. Give it a rest, rookie. I was thinking of you cops. You high school grads... would normally be outside in the heat. No college, right? Chill out, woman. I won't kill him. We can't have you hitting him, either. You on his side? When danger approaches a detainee, abate the threat, no matter who. "Abate" this! Regardless, at least refrain from hitting Kiyomaru here. Beat him back in the box at HQ, then it won't be our concern. Nobody's gonna hit anyone. No way! A truck busted over the expressway? Nitroglycerin Get down! Move! That bonehead! He didn't know which bus was ours. - I wonder. - Huh? That TV helicopter has been hovering over us the whole time. You're imagining things. Everyone's staring at our bus. Oh no... Can't we move yet? Still waiting on orders. Check out the Kiyomaru Site! - I wasn't my imagination... a security leak. - Move, ASAP. What? - Something happen? - Got it. Wait. Inspector Takamine, from the NPA, is heading here... regarding the security leak. Seems our transport plan is in limbo. You mean we can't move? Seal off the road. Get those people out of here. Don't let anyone near us. Odds are these cops might leak intel. Who said it was a cop'? - Who else, then? - Are... Are you married? Your wedding ring. Do you have a little daughter? Get back. Orders from Inspector Takamine. Agent Okumura, are you inside? - Open it. - Wait. If the bullets were a hair higher, you'd be dead. If the bullets were a hair higher... you'd... be dead. In time, your hearing will return. You okay? Just a sprain. I'm fine. I know why the bosses chose you, Inspector Mekari. I'd like to apologise for... the wanton behaviour of the men under my command. As a result of our deliberations, we've come to the conclusion that... the current transport plan must be abandoned. Today's transport is abandoned. I have an idea. They're moving. The Kiyomaru transport is in motion. Stopped at 16:26 in Kite-Kyushu, Kiyomura is moving again. We're safe. They aren't on to us. Surprised those NPA muckety-mucks let us do it. Their massive transport unit makes a great decoy Mekari, your idea worked, right? As a decoy unit, he can cover his ass for wasting taxes. And Metro HQ can take the blame. Actually we'll take the blame. But will going by train be safe? As long as no one finds out... taking Kiyomaru back to Tokyo won't be so hard. Only Takamine's team and us know the plan. This train stops in... Shin-Kobe, Shin-Osaka, Kyoto, Nagoya, Shin- Yokohama and Shinagawa. Soon departing at 17:47. The train for Tokyo leaves now. Agent Okumura, let's use this carriage. - OK. - Is something wrong? Seal off this carriage. I'm terribly sorry but... due to electrical problems... I'd like to ask everyone to move to the next carriage. Sorry for the inconvenience. We've upgraded you to premium seats. Thanks for your cooperation. Sekiya, guard the front door. You two, take the rear. Don't let anyone through. Wait. We're in command here. No, he's right. We'd better spread out. Go to low profile mode. Check the Kiyomaru Site. Tokyo arrival... 22:35, eh? We're shorthanded. Trust them. Employment Opportunities: Holding Cell Cop, Nurse, SWAT Team Members Attempted Murder Fee: 100 Million Yen - Mekari. - What now? Look at this. Since when? Back at the ambulance; it was flashing when we hit the highway Only us five and that conductor know... that we're here. What's wrong? Get your phones out. Cell GPS is the only answer I got. Accusing one of us of leaking intel? Who else could it be? The conductor was next to me and didn't contact anyone. That leaves us, so gimme your phones. And if we do, what then? I'll keep them safe. There's no proof you didn't... No proof... including you. My partner's the only one who wouldn't do that. And my partner's the only one I'm sure about. We can't fall apart now. Show me your damn phone! Nice guys like you always turn out to be the mole. How convenient for you... Maybe your hatred of Kiyomaru was just an act. You too, Mekari. You don't trust the man who took a bullet for Kiyomaru? Anyway let's empty our pockets. The transmitter needn't be a phone. You've no reason to doubt us. What if he can get Ninagawa's money by leaking our location? And what if he could do his duty and not be doubted by anyone? Mekari already has... a strong motive to kill a man like Kiyomaru. What? His wife's accident. How does that matter? The drunk driver that killed his wife... had a previous manslaughter charge. He got out of prison and... killed Mekari's wife whilst under the influence. He's human garbage... Scum, like Kiyomaru. You want men like that dead, right? If it were my wife, I would. If you doubt me, investigate me all you like. We will, then. That's enough. Everybody's got their reasons. I got a granddaughter, like the victim. She's as cute as a button, but... I could never kill Kiyomaru. Have you... forgiven that truck driver? No, I haven't. Would killing him help? Would it bring my dead wife back? - Why so cut-and-dry? - I ain't cut-and-dry I saw Chika Ninagawa's dead body It was worse than what the media said. Way fucking worse! No human could do what he did. I'll never forget her little body I ain't her parent. Hell, I ain't even a father. But I sure as hell want to kill Kiyomaru. But not you'? "Go do it". My wife said that. "Protecting people is your job, so go do it. " If she hadn't said that... I might've killed that truck driver. Her words alone have... kept me going for three years. Body search. Hurry up. What's important is to eliminate every possibility one by one. That's our job, right? Sorry I doubted you. If it's not us then how'd they find him? Here's a theory... That man behind Inspector Takamine... A Public Security detective. He might've tailed us. Okayama Station Police Woman... Got any hobbies? Talking with you is forbidden. Wanna know my... turn-ons and turn-offs? Police. You can't come through. Why not? 'Cause I said so, asshole. Who you calling asshole? Go back and sit your ass down. - Shiraiwa, fall back! - Now! In here. - Go back to your seat. - Bite me, cop! Get an ambulance on standby! AIOl STATION Medics only! New! Hurry UP! Relax. You're fine, Kanbashi. You... Is it worth... protecting Kiyomaru? Why'd... we... Why'd we... risk our lives for that piece of shit? Damn it. If I die... my mom... will be all alone. I got it. Try not to talk. Kan bashi. Kan bashi! Kan bashi! Who died? That... short-fused cop'? Karma's a bitch, eh? Shut up, or I'll shoot you in the back. This station doesn't have a garage, so the CSI will happen at Himeji Station. The Hyogo police are on standby We'll let the passengers off at Himeji and switch trains. Change trains? You can't stop at Himeji. - Why not? - I just got word... Thanks to the Kiyomaru Site, Himeji is way out of hand. Mechanics on the train line have been pushed back. This train will go past Himeji, and head for Shin-Kobe. Please disembark there. - No, we... - That is the final word from Japan Rail. You'll be fine. At Shin-Kobe, 120 SWAT are deployed. Now I'm worried. Move it. Make way Move it. What do we do now? Mix with the crowd and escape. Where is everyone? For passenger safety we chose an empty platform. The SWAT team sealed all exits. No passengers can board. This train will pull into the garage. Go back! Gimme the radio. Stop! Police! Police! I'll shoot! Kiyomaru! Bring me Kiyomaru! Stop! Stop it! I'll kill this kid! Give me Kiyomaru! Stop! - Put down the knife - Stop. Go back. We can't abandon the child. That's not our job. The guy's serious. Every second counts. Ugly brat... Our mission is to protect and transport Kiyomaru. If we just stand by and let her die, then fuck being a cop! Advance. No... If you want Kiyomaru alive, back those SWAT boys off. I need you out of here. What... are you doing? I'll save the girl... and he'll be dead. You won't shoot. You only want to scare me. You testify that I fired. We'll split the 1 billion. Are you serious? Don't fall for her trap. She might be testing you. This way no more victims like Kanbashi will perish. How persuasive! Don't... Don't do it. You sure? Too bad. I'll kill her! Bring me Kiyomaru! Stay back! Mommy! It's no use! - Give up, will ya? - I said, stay back! - I'll stab her! - Stop! It's not too late. Let the kid go. I got nothing left! Nothing other than killing Kiyomaru! Throw down the knife. Look at her. She's scared to death. Everything's aka)'- OK3)'- That's good. Now... give me the knife. Think about your family You... idiot! You can't fool me! - The hell with all of you! - Drop it! Bring him out! I'll kill her! Kanbashi is rolling over in his grave. What now? Back. Get out! Do it now. Get out. Now. Get out now! Not you. Tell the driver to take us to Tokyo. Tell him now! Kyoto Station Nagoya Station If we keep going non-stop, we'll be in Tokyo in 90 minutes. Wreckage on the line, seven kilometers ahead. Seems someone dropped it there on purpose. How long you gonna make me walk'? I can't walk any further. We've been walking all day and not one car has passed. Make a plan before you drag me around. Shut up. What do you mean, "all day"? A car. What now? Something wrong? - I'm borrowing your car. - What?! - Hold on... - Please get out. New! - What? - Hands on the car. - What the hell? Stop it! What gives? - I'm taking your phone. - You're what? - Sit in the passenger seat. I'm starving. And thirsty too. You're violating my human rights. Where are we going? I can't answer that either. Important enough to steal an innocent man's car? Sorry National security is the reason. Does everyone... do you cops... think this is the right thing to do? What do you mean? Is protecting him so important? That's what I mean! Okumura, pull over! Kiyomaru! How can you protect scum like him? You're crazy Why didn't you protect my Megumi? Why him and not... my Megumi? Megumi... Megumi Nishino... Kiyomaru's first victim. So you're Megumi's father? Now that you mention it, she had your eyes. She was so fine... so soft and tender. I loved... her... Megumi... Shut up! Mekari... If someone's going to kill Kiyomaru, don't you think he has the right? - You nuts? - Our location's being leaked to the Kiyomaru Site. It won't be long before... Shut your hole, bitch... When will you learn to shut your hole?! Mr Nishino, please stop. Mr Nishino, please stop! Mr Nishino! I'm sorry I'm borrowing your car and phone. We're off. Shiraiwa! Was it you'? Why do you assume it's me? After my partner and me, that only leaves you. You were texting in the car, weren't you'? - I was checking the Kiyomaru Site. - Your fingers were... you were texting. Shiraiwa... we must eliminate each possibility - I texted my family - At a time like this? Then show me. That's an order. Congrats on getting an 80 in math. Mommy won't make it home tonight Reheat the curry from last night. What? What does it say? Show me. - Gimme that transmitter. - What the hell. I dunno what they paid you, but you can't spend it if you're dead. Get real. It's not me. Search. Search all you want! You won't find anything. Pointing your gun at me... is violating our mission. A microchip? Get me a knife. As long as I told our location... I'd get my 1 billion yen, no matter who killed Kiyomaru. I'd never be arrested, and get paid. That's why you kept on the job, right? Duty is duty There's no lying in that. I was approached long before our transport team was assembled. So they can mobilise the top brass at the NPA. Don't you have any pride as a detective? I do. Kiyomaru beat a seven-year-old girl to death. When the doc pulled back her eyelids from her bloated, beaten face... it was covered in his sperm! Lieutenant Mekari... You're a top cop and an admirable SF'... fair and square as a person, too. Is it worth risking your life to protect Kiyomaru? No, it ain't. No fucking way! When he gets out of jail again, he'll kill another little girl. How do you plan to apologise to her?! The world's full of natural-born human waste like him. The world's full of people without a hint of remorse. You of all people should know. Let's end this. If you don't... a day will come when you regret... that Kiyomaru survived. I'll give you half my reward. Okumura, it's funny... When the subject of money comes up... everything you say sounds like an excuse. Fall in! Where are you'? Are you OK? What do you mean? Okumura reported in... Said you and Shiraiwa are being held hostage by Kiyomaru. I knew it; he lied. Okumura was the mole. What's going on there? Following Okumura's lead... and prioritising rescuing you two... the NPA are resorting to issuing that Kiyomaru be gunned down. The second condition to the billion yen: Anyone who kills Kiyomaru by order of the nation. Legal execution in the line of duty They've mobilised personnel in Shizuoka to follow you. Get Kiyomaru to the nearest police station ASAP. Too dangerous. We won't make it in time. They have your plates. Mekari, what can I do? Shall I send back up? No... I'm fine. Bye for now. Why didn't you ask him where he was? I can't have any more of my men... killed! Think of your sick child. All the cash in the world can't cure him. As Ninagawa ordered me, I assigned Mekari and single mother Shiraiwa to this mission. I figured my involvement ended there. - No more... - We can't go back now. If the public learn we sold our souls... you're going down, too. They'll think we're going by train. How can we get to Tokyo? Public transport and rental cars are out. They know our faces. We need an ordinary car. Yuya, where's my phone? - Fucked if I know. - Fucked if you know? - Where is it? At our place? - Not there. - You're so sloppy Somebody's here. Look. Over there. Kiyomaru! What are you doing? What were you gonna do? I'm gonna get killed anyhow. No one will kill you. It's no use. It's gonna happen. Let me have one more prank. Just do your job and protect me... but stay out of my way - Top brass think we're his hostages, right? - Seems so. The police have been ordered to shoot to kill. So I've got the right to kill him, then. Too bad, but you won't be shooting him. If you shoot him... you'll get 1 billion yen. Your pride won't let that slide. Ninagawa miscalculated. Without the bounty I'd have shot him. I have a request... If either one of you... kills me and gets the billion, could you take a tiny bit... and give it... to my poor old mom? What? My mom raised me all on her own. But I've never... done anything good to show her my love. At the very least... I'll trade my life. To help her in later life... could you give her some money? Please. Wanna ride? Get in. - You know who he is, right? - Yeah, he's famous. - Then why let us in? - Because I'm a cabbie... And I got no customers today Every inch is packed with police. They're gonna kill him. He was on the news all day Talk of his transport. I've had it up to here with news, news about folks trying to kill him... The knife man and the young hostage at Shin-Kobe. He was a company president being hunted by debtors. I guess he wanted to leave money behind for his family While nursing his sick mother, he never complained and worked hard. That lock-up cop's wife was terminal. The nurse's husband got downsized. The SWAT guys were gamblers, so I guess they had it coming. All of them had money problems. All willing to be arrested, but hoping to leave the money to their families. Fat cat Ninagawa's money game was a ruse to feed on poor people. I dunno how much money he has, but... he can't believe he can buy anybody My cab fare ain't for fee, ya know? I got it. How about this? Good day Shizuoka Police. - Haven't you caught Kiyomaru yet? - Not yet, ma'am. All clear. Go ahead. Just like you said: they don't bother checking cabs. Better to go via Yamanashi instead of Kanagawa. Fewer road blocks. Three hours to go. We can still make it. We interrupt the music to bring you this news update... Last night, a woman was found dead in her apartment in Kushiro, Hokkaido. The woman was the mother of the fugitive Kunihide Kiyomaru, Taeko Kiyomaru, age 58. Judging from a note discovered at the scene, suicide is highly likely The note read: "Kunihide, in exchange for my life, do me a favour. Don't do anything bad no more. Don't hurl others no more. Please, I beg you. "Mommy is waiting for you in heaven.  Please let me out. Stop. I need to get out... Please. - How about it, Mekari? - Let me out. Let's rest. I wanna check the Kiyomaru Site. Hello? Mekari? The SP, right? speaking. Ninagawa here. I'll give you two billion. Make that three billion. You're going about this all wrong. And and all ways are awed. Cops are dead. Kiyomaru's mother killed herself. You got nothing to say? I'm sorry for your loss. Don't say it like you don't know. It's your fault. Why all the collateral damage? Save your breath. I want Kiyomaru dead. It's that simple. If you want the driver who killed your wife... I'm your man. You're... crazy Are we so different? We're the same. We both had someone precious killed by irrational means... by someone who doesn't deserve to live. Ninagawa! No more innocent lives. If you want him dead, kill him yourself. I don't approve... of you using others. Shiraiwa! Sorry I let my guard down. I'm fine. I won't die. My son, he's still... He's still... in third grade... I promised... to play catch... Shiraiwa. Shiraiwa! She croaked. For you... for you: she risked her life to protect you. How? How could you? Because... she smelled like an old woman. She stunk up the car. Kill me and... your dead wife won't forgive you. "Protecting people... "is your job. " She... never said that. She was in a coma at the hospital. She never said a word. I made it all up in my head. I had to believe in that fairy-tale... or I wouldn't have survived. Did you hear we had a baby? We did... a girl inside her womb. I thought I'd... go in and kill that truck driver. In my mind, I killed him many times. If I wasn't a cop... I would have done it. If I wasn't a cop... I'd have killed you right away Wanna know something? Of us five, the one who wanted you dead the most... was me! We... brought in Kiyomaru. Mekari... I... Ninagawa... Detain Ninagawa. - Wait. - Mekari! You brought Kiyomaru to HQ. Your job... is done. Until Ninagawa calls off his 1 billion yen bounty... Kiyomaru will be killed some day And if that happens... what our team did, will have been a waste. I can't face... those like Shiraiwa who died in the line of duty protecting him. I'll convince him. I'm very sorry for... the loss of your grandchild. I know a thing or two about... losing someone precious. A dark... dark forest is where he took her. A seven-year-old girl, in that darkness... Try to imagine her fear... Can you'? Then thrown away like garbage. How can you forgive that? How can you'? You'd feel the same way as me, right? Right'? Mr Ninagawa... Would your granddaughter have wanted all this? Listen to the whispers of the dead. Is Chika... saying that she wants you to kill him? The dead can't speak. visit: shokomovies. blogspot. com Once they're dead, it's over. visit: shokomovies. blogspot. com You honestly think so? visit: shokomovies. blogspot. com You simply think that they speak. You need to believe that yourself. The dead... can't speak for themselves. With him alive and Chika dead... I can't... forgive myself. Amazing... - Got him! - Secure him! You OK'? Hang in there! Get an ambulance, now! In the name of national pride, his life is top priority! Coming through! Make way! visit: shokomovies. blogspot. com The suspect Ninagawa, who ordered the killing, is being questioned. After his arrest, Ninagawa called off the 1 billion yen bounty. While admitting the charges, he remains silent about police involvement. As for Kiyomaru, who was charged with the death of Chika Ninagawa, the police are investigating his other crimes. Thus ending the case... the killer Kiyomaru remains alive. Kiyomaru Sentenced to Death Do you have any last words? Regret... I'm searching my soul. Since I'm getting the death penalty... I wish I'd killed more people.
