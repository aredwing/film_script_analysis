Some notes that are a little bit more objective. Notes that express what you feel work and doesn't work about the movie. So what we have here is basically a marriage of convenience, in a sense, we have a film that we'd like to test in front of an audience, a film that we're editing, and your teacher, Mr. Federico, the great Professor Federico, sorry I omitted that, who used to be my great professor at one point, needed a two-hour class to kill. So I'm going to say this knowing full well that most of you will forget it or dismiss it, but these forms that my handsome assistant editor, D-Money, is handing out... It's Darryl. They're not a forum for you to try to impress us with how clever you are, or to tell us how shitty the movie is. We know the movie has problems. We know it's imperfect. That's one of the reasons we're here. What we're looking for from you guys today is basically comments that are constructive, ideally in a way that will allow us to make the movie better in the editing room as we continue to play with it. So how about a nice warm round of applause for the assistant editor. Let's give it up to my prodigal student, Nick. Do you have a question? Yeah, um, is Jamie Kirkland gonna be here? Yes, Jamie Kirkland will be here. Mmm-hmm. In case you guys don't already know, actresses love it when you criticize their work publicly. They take it extremely well, so, uh, no, she won't be here, but the director and the producer of the film... ...will be here, and they could field any questions that you might have. Which reminds me, if you guys would be kind enough to silence your phones and other gadgets I'd appreciate it. Okay, guys, thanks again, hope you enjoy the film. Darryl, sit down for a second, please? It's not a big deal or anything, and I don't want to make it something that it's not... Fine, but I do want to get back in there, man. This'll just take a second and it's generally pretty positive. Okay? Since you started dating... - Liana. - Liana, yeah, I know her name. Which has been, what, two or three months, something like that? - A little more. - A little more. You've been much more focused at work. You're much more engaged and enthused, and, creatively, I think you're coming up with some of the best stuff I've ever seen you come up with in our three years together. - Just phenomenal stuff. - Thank you. I agree with that. I agree with that, definitely. And in the moments when you're not constantly fighting with each other, I think you're generally really happy. - I am. - And I can see that every day. I am, man. I agree with that, man. - I'm gonna go back in there. - Okay. I know you don't like to watch, but I like to watch the movie. I know you do. This is what I'm getting at. That being said, I've noticed recently... ...that some of the energy that's been freed up through your relationship with... - Liana. Why is it... - Liana, right. - Liana. - 'Cause it's a weird name. - It's not a weird name. - It's uncommon. It's an uncommon name. Some of that energy has been replaced by... ...constantly having to deal with her. It's like the pendulum has swung the other way. Okay, I'm gonna stop you right there, and I'm gonna say you're wrong. If you notice, I stopped drinking, - I'm, like, more focused... - Shh. - I care about my body more... - Shh. Here it comes. - Nothing. - Nothing. - This is gonna be brutal. - That was the big joke, too. That was probably one of our best jokes. So, uh, what was your favorite part of the film? "The beagle." Actually, I wrote that. Okay, but then, what was your least favorite? "I was really upset when the beagle died." They formed an attachment, that's something. Sure. Here's a good one. "I want to fuck Jamie Kirkland." Me, too. Well, see, that's another positive, right there. - Yeah. - Very positive. People are attracted to the star. Yeah, one of my honors students. This whole thing is a wash, man. I didn't even want this to happen. I mean, clearly what the cards suggest is that people are the most confused about whether or not it's a light romantic comedy about a dog-walker, or a dark, cautionary tale about pet euthanasia. These cards are like tea leaves, they can mean whatever you want them to mean. Look, we have three weeks until we have to lock the film for its premiere. I say we roll up our sleeves, try to address these tonal issues as best as we can. If it doesn't work, it doesn't work. Have you seen Broadcast News? 81/2, Shadows, Faces, Last Tango in Paris, Scarecrow? Yes. I mean, no one's like... No one in real life is like, uh... "Excuse me, are you a quirky waiter? "Or you a depressed waiter?" It's not that... It's like you're a complicated complex human being. That's what I'm... That's this film. I think we're all set, thank you very much. I need help. I need help, Darryl. I need help. - What are you doing? - Um, yeah. Well, I think you guys are both making some, um... Some good points, but I think, at the end of the day, we're kind of all on the same page here. Are you fucking listening? Are you listening to a word we've said? We're on opposite pages right now. Like, this page right here says... It's got a big giant dick on it. And it says, "The movie blowed." All right? This here, "What's your favorite part of the film?" "The bad acting." That's why we have these editors. So they can fix the bad acting. What... What now? It's morning time. It's morning time. Mmm. Do you need that light on? Yeah. I need light to see things. Yeah? Hello, boobs. I love the smell of boobs in the morning. It's great. Thank you. How many times did you snooze through the alarm this morning? Like 45, 50? I'm having a really hard time getting up lately. - Mmm-hmm. - How was the screening? - It went okay. - Yeah? Everything went better than I feared. I think we got a lot of, um... You know... I feel like if I talk about it I'm not going to be able to go back to sleep. Well, then go back to sleep. Okay. You know, I can't help but think that if our roles were reversed right now I would be a lot more considerate and courteous than you're being right now to me. And you're somehow punishing me for being able to sleep in later than you. James Dean swag, leather jacket, white T-shirt Rolled up sleeves, nigga lookin' like a greaser  The time has come. Say goodbye to Rodney the Doorman. What are you doing? - You know what I'm doing. - No! What are you doing? That's Rodney's moment to shine, right there. Are you serious? The movie's 20 minutes too long, Darryl. All right? The fifth reel's dragging. This guy's monologue has been on the chopping block since day one. - Yo! - We talked about this. This is not even a bad scene, man. I'm not saying it's a bad scene, it just doesn't fit in this particular movie. Look, this is why the good Lord created DVDs. Right? For deleted scenes just like this one. Yo, this brother does a good job. - A real good job. - This who does a good job? - This brother. - You're gonna make it racial now? I'm not making it racial, man. This is Rodney's moment to shine right here, okay? This is Morgan Freeman trailer talk right here. No, look, she's already made her mind up. She loves Paul, she's gonna marry Paul, he adds nothing new to that. He's just getting in the way of the whole ending of the movie. - You're wrong. - Look, I don't get pleasure out of doing this. - You do! I know you do. - I don't. You knew I liked this, and you wanna cut it out. Look, think of it this way. We're like surgeons... This is bullshit. You've said this before. We're like surgeons, and this is malignant growth, and we need to splice it out. Did I ever tell you this? Kevin Costner was deleted from The Big Chill. Did you know that? Fuck Kevin Costner. Exactly. Nick! Here! Mike, I got a 7:30 dinner reservation, I can't... Get the fuck in here. - What's up? - New project. Okay... We start shooting in two weeks, okay? I tell the director you're the man, you got the job. You can stay right here, jump right on to the next one. Okay. I was actually curious to see if you'd ask me about this. - Okay. - There is one thing. - Is it a money thing? - Yes. - I can't work for less. - Fine. But it's all I got. I'll get you an intern... No, no. I'm not working with an intern. Absolutely not. I cannot afford two editors. Well, then get one shitty editor. What do you want me to say? Darryl and I have been working together for years. - Great! - We're a team. He's your wet nurse. We complement each other. Okay? He does all the technical stuff, all the organizational stuff, he keeps everything tidy. Whatever! Learn that shit. No, no, the point is, I don't want to. If he does all that stuff, it allows me to focus on the editorial stuff. To do a good job on making the movie better. Okay? That's why we're a perfect team. - I'm not kidding. - I'm not kidding either! - Fine! - Fine! Fine. Fine which way? My way. Fine. Okay. Well, what does that mean? You're selfish. I'm just saying that sometimes when we're intimate you only think about yourself. Okay. Is this about last night? Last night, I just... I got overexcited. That's what you do to me! It's not like I didn't try to get you off. You get so defensive! Baby, how can you say something offensive like you just said to me and expect me not to get defensive? You just don't see possibilities. What does that mean, baby? You keep saying that. I don't know what that means. All right? Every other night - you're coming two or three times... - Darryl... Shh. Keep your voice down. And the one time I'm a minute man you act like it's affecting our relationship or something. Don't talk to me like that. Like what? With that tone! - That tone in your voice. - I don't have a... Baby, I naturally have a deep voice. Okay. Okay. Baby? - Baby. - What? Okay. I hear what you're saying. All right? I do. Next time I have a quick situation... Mmm-hmm? I'll go down on you. Okay? Fine. That's all I wanted you to say. See, this is why compromise works. You're right. A lot of the stuff that you say, like, it resonates in me. Good. Wake up! Talk to me. No! Get off. Mmm-mmm. - Get off! - Nope. This is it. I'm stuck. I wanna sleep, seriously. But this is the only time I ever get to talk to you anymore. We'll talk later. - Nope. - You just don't wanna go to work. Don't make me go. If I tell you something, will you get off me? Maybe. I've been offered to cut another movie. - Really? - Mmm-hmm. That's great. It's great, but the budget's not gonna allow them to hire Darryl. Hmm. I know, and I fought for him, too. That's really too bad. I could take less money I guess. Mmm-mmm. No, you can't do that, 'cause you need to get rich so I can quit and become a real housewife of New Jersey. You're right, I can't. But you're a good boy for even thinking about doing that. My mom always used to tell me that every man wants to hear that he's a good boy. - Oh, yeah? - That's what she said. Well, you are a very, very, very good boy. - You're in a good mood. - Mmm-hmm. - Yep. - What's going on? - I wanna have sex with you. - Excuse me? I wanna do it. First of all, it's way too early. Oh, yeah? Secondly, you're gonna be extremely late to work. I know. Thirdly, I have to be romanced a little bit more. I'm not that easy. - What if I, uh, romanced you right now? - Uh-oh, don't... - Don't do that. - Do you like that? Can I help you? Oh! You don't even need to be romanced. That's not for you. - Who's it for? - That's for the mattress. - Please? - Okay. All right. I gotta pee first though. - Will you brush your teeth, too? - So demanding! But is there some sort of supervisor I can talk to? Oh, you're your own supervisor. Okay. Well, in that case... Hello? Hello? No, no, no, I'm in an elevator, I can't call you back. No, it took forever for me to talk to you - and to get through because of your... - Hey, dog, dog! - Oh, shit! - Where's the door-open button? I just have a key. It's not working! You should let go of that leash. Okay. What do we do? What the fuck! - Let go. Let it go. - Okay. - No, the leash, let it go! - Oh! Oh, my God. Oh! - Baxter! - Move, watch out, watch out! Whoa, you have a knife? Eagle Scout. It's the highest rank attainable in the Boy Scouts of America. - Hi. - Hey. Uh... Sorry to interrupt the process. I was actually looking for Adrian? Hi I'm Nick Burger. I'm the editor. Hey! Jamie Kirkland, I'm, uh... Yeah, I know who you are. Adrian's out sick today. Is there anything I can help you with? Well, I just came by to check out some of the scenes. Do you mind if I stick around for a bit, or... You wanna sit down? - Yeah, that'd be great. - Yeah, sure, you wanna have a seat? Cool, thanks. Honestly, I think more people were worried about the dog dying... - Did you have one of those animal cruelty... - Oh, yes! The ASPCA, or whatever it is? I couldn't get the initials down, but, yeah, we had one of those. Just monitoring the dog, making sure the dog was happy... It was hard core! - Hey! - Hey, this is my assistant editor, - D-Money. - It's Darryl. - Hey, how you doing? - You remember Jamie. - Nice to meet you. - Good to see you. No, we actually met at the wrap party. I don't know if you remember. Oh, shit. Yeah, I do. Yeah, we danced to Thriller together. Great, it was fun, a lot of fun. I didn't get a chance to tell you this at the time, but I'm, like, a big fan of your work. The new show you're on, I love it. - Thank you. - I love it, it's great. What's your favorite episode of the show that she's on? Like a real standout episode, I'm just curious. Okay, that's awkward. You don't have to answer that. My favorite episode by far... I mean, they're all great, but the one that really stood out is when your character Dana Dixon is finally reunited with her long-lost brother, Crash Dixon, when he comes back from Afghanistan. - Yeah. - And the way it kind of very organically - works toward this very moving ending. - Right. I thought was very well done. Yes, that was one of my favorite episodes as well. - Yeah? - Yeah. That was a good one, yeah. Do you have a different one, though? - The first one was good. - Oh, the pilot! Yeah, the pilot. The pilot episode. That's awesome. It just kind of introduced all the characters, and everyone, you got kind of a taste for who the characters were. All that stuff was great. I just, um... Did you look at my scene yet? No, actually, I dove into the elevator scene. Kind of... Sort of playing with that again. - I've shown it to Jamie. - Yeah. It's actually really funny. Yeah, she liked it, I think it's cutting well. Oh, okay, you didn't look at it. I'm not, I'm just saying, like, all this being yours is a little unbelievable. You're so stupid. I'm not judging you, baby. You know, I've dated girls before you. Yeah, I'm sure you have. Here we go. - Hey, hey, hey. - What? I wanna tell you something. I love you. Are you being for real? Are you making fun of me? I'm serious. No, no, I'm not making fun of you, no! No, I wanted to tell you the same thing. Me, too, I wanted to say I love you. I love you, too. It's, like, we could wait to tell each other, but I feel it. And what's the point of not telling you? I totally agree. I totally agree, baby. So, who are we meeting up with? Do you remember the producer who wants to put me in the show? Yes. I do remember you telling me about that. - Yeah, well... - This is him? Yeah. Right here? Ah, cool. Look at you networking. I should be networking. Hey! Darryl... Darryl. What's up, man? - Alejandro. - Alejandro. Nice to meet you, man. Right this way. Okay, baby. Do you need a ride somewhere? You know what? It's a nice night for a walk, man. I'm cool. You sure? Yeah. It is. Have a nice night there, man. Take care, brother. Have a good night. All right, man, you too. Get her home safe. What? Wait, wait. So what happened? She tells me she loves me, right? Mmm-hmm. And then... - In the car... - Before she gets in the car. Before she gets in the car. She tells me she loves me, and then I take her to this car, and then he gives her a ride home. Who's he? I thought you were on a date with her. I told you, man, he's like a show producer. Oh, okay, he's a show producer. Right. And what time of night is this? Like, 12:00 in the morning. - Midnight? - Yeah, it was late. - Oh, that's late. - Well, just let me finish. Well, that's late, that's important. That's why I thought it was a problem. But she says he's legit and, like, he's a real show producer. All right, let's go to, like, Oh, perfect, okay. It's already there. Okay, great. Yeah, okay, wonderful. So you know what's going on here... You guys know that I got Yoga at 3:00. That's a hard-out for me. Yeah. It's at the top of our minds. - Good. - Yeah. So why don't you hop up there, we'll test your levels. Try it a few times. All right, so I'm basically just playing this guy who's running - away from a dog. - Yeah. Exactly. And be a little bit, uh, out of breath. You know, and freaked out a little bit. - Ready? - All right, let's hit it. Hey, why's this dog chasing me? Why is the dog chasing me? - Somebody get the dog. - "The dog's gonna bite me." The dog's gonna bite me! Somebody stop him! Yeah, just loosen it up. Have a little more fun with it, you know, like... - Yeah. - The dog's... The dog's gonna bite me! That's good, keep the looseness, and now give it a little more character, like... Like, give it, like, um... Give it like a little urban sensibility. You know? - You want it blacker. - Blacken it up. All right. You don't know any other black people, do you? Just try it. Uh... Somebody stop this dog! Somebody get... This dog don't got a leash! Goddamn this dog gonna get me! If this dog gets me, I'm gon' probably get rabies. This dog is gonna bite my ass. Yeah, good, good. Save it, save it for the real thing. That was good. Well? What do you think? You want me to cue that up? Yeah, see if those levels work, and then we'll do the real thing. Okay, so it's midnight, she's in this show producer's car... Bottom line, all right. I don't think this girl... I know she would not cheat on me right in front of my face... You know, she did say she loved you, so... I don't know why she would have lied about that. I'm sorry, you... This is between him and I. I'm not trying to be a jerk... You're having a conversation in the same room as me. I understand that, we're working together... But I just need you to stay out of my business. Let's just focus on the session. I would love to finish this movie before I die. - So let's just... - Me, too. - Keep focused. - I'm with you on that. All right, so she doesn't hit me back last night, but she texted me this morning. Let me show you what she sent me. - She sent you this this morning? - Just this morning. "Hey, babe, I know you're busy, just want to tell you how much I appreciate you." Sweet. I don't know, man. Could be dealing with some sort of mad, evil genius I've never encountered before. I'm all cued up. - Yeah? - Yeah. Let's try a few. Let's just roll a bunch in a row and see what happens. Remember, you're afraid, you're energetic, and there's a little bit of, you know, urban-ness. - Ready? - Okay. Put this motherfucking dog on a leash! That was perfect for me, guys. I think we got it. So, how did you guys meet? Me and Amy, or Darryl and I? Oh, let me tell her. I saw his brown eyes from across the room... No. You and Amy. Me and Amy. Well, Amy had fallen off the platform of the B train... Oh, my God. And the train was rolling into the station and caught on fire. No, that's not true. He's playing. That's not true. We met on the Internet. Boring. It's lame, I know. It's kind of lame. That's very lame. Boring! What are you going to do? But this guy, me and him met... I was teaching at New York Film Academy. And somehow... I still don't know how you got ahold of my e-mail address. But somehow he got ahold of my e-mail address and started stalking me for a year. The same thing happened with me, but on Facebook. Don't put me out there like that. Don't put me out there, but yes. Stalker, right here. The squeaky wheel does get the grease. And then a little while later, I was editing a short film, which was a total nightmare project... Right, so I come in, and I take care of everything, you know. Handle it like a boss does, 'cause I'm the boss. I do boss shit. You know this, baby. I don't even know why I'm telling you this. He pulled some boss shit on it and retrieved the media, totally saved my ass. He saved me untold weeks of work. He saved the producers a lot of money, and was a lot of fun to work with. - How about cheers to that? - Cheers! That's great! I hate that you guys have a more romantic story than us. I have friends who do the Internet dating thing, but I just... I could never. - I could never. - Mmm. Nick, I don't wanna get on you or anything, but these carrots are a little undercooked. Darryl, that's not nice. Nick knows I love his cooking. The carrots are cooked perfectly. They're al dente. Okay, well, if that's French for "not quite cooked," then sure. They're al dente. But I don't like them. "Al dente" is Italian. It's not French. Oh, baby, he's getting... Did you hear how defensive he's getting? You are being very rude. How am I being rude? Cheers. No? It's good chicken. No! No, no! Stop, stop. Please, save them. You guys don't deserve my carrots. I want you to save the good carrots! No, you don't deserve them. I don't deserve them? No. - You didn't have any during dinner. - I thought they were delicious. I was saving them for lunch. It's pearls before the swine. No one gets them. Wow. One line, huh? Yep, just one line, but it's a pivotal line. It's critical for the story. I bet. Okay. All right, so when she's ready, we're going to show you the scene on that monitor over there. - Okay. - Okay. And, uh... When you did it, I personally feel there was only one take where you really, like, really nailed it. I think you're touching your chest when you say it, so I think there's a body mike that's ruffled up. - Oh, yeah. - So that's what we're gonna try to... So we're gonna try to get that clean. All right? Okay. Where's Adrian? Adrian is meeting with distributors today, so... Okay. Okay, how we doing? Um, okay, so you have to just let me know exactly what line you want replaced. I e-mailed this all to you. Yeah, I didn't get it. You didn't get the e-mail? No. It didn't go through? I don't know if your e-mail went through. Why don't we open up your inbox and I can show you that you probably got the e-mail? Or we could just do it now. Okay, the line is, "I can't believe I let you talk to me like that." Okay. And who says it? Who... Who's in that booth right now? - See that woman waving to you? - Hi. That's how we do it. The actor who screwed up the line, we bring them back in to fix the line. That's the... That's the quirky system we have. Cue the scene, please. How you feeling? You all right? - I'm great. - Need a water or anything? I've got my apple juice. Okay. Why don't you try it a few times while she's getting ready? The line? Yeah. Okay. Um... I can't believe I let you talk to me like that. I can't believe I let you talk to me like that. - What? Talk... - No, no, it's good, it's good. First of all, slow it down a little bit. But also, secondly, I feel like when you... And you'll see it when we show it to you, but I feel like when you said it, like... Maybe just try it a little sexier. Sorry, can you say that again? I know that didn't sound sexy just now when I said it. I don't know, it was interesting. Like, I got a whiff for the first time, when you said it that way, that, you know, maybe this is a girl who... Maybe she likes being with a man who is a little bit assertive. Oh. Does she? Maybe she likes being with a man who talks a little bit dirty to her. You know what I mean? Does she? Yeah, I know what you mean. - Try it. - Try what? Try it the way I just explained it to you. Tell me how you want it. You know how I want it. I just told you how I want it. I don't know how you want it. I don't know you yet, but I can give you what you like. Tell me what you want. Do it a little slower, softer, and sexier. You like it slow? Yeah, I like it slow. I can't believe I let you talk to me like that. Good. Say it again. So demanding. Telling me what to do. Say it again. I can't believe I let you talk to me like that. What did you say? I said, I can't believe I let you talk to me like that. I'll talk to you any way I goddamn please. - Are you? - Yeah. You're gonna fucking talk dirty to me? And you're gonna say these lines exactly how I want them. Or else what? Or else we're gonna do it over and over and over again until I get what I fucking need from you. I'm gonna say it to you like you like it. Otherwise I'm gonna choke the fuck out of you because I can't believe I let you talk to me like that. I'm gonna shove these lines down your fucking throat and you're gonna want more. I'm gonna want more, I'm gonna swallow it, and I'm gonna fucking love it. I can't believe I let you talk to me like that. And you're gonna spit it back to me exactly the way I fucking want it. I can't believe I let you talk to me like that. Yeah, good. I think we're... I think we're all set. Okay, I'm gonna need, like, 20 minutes. - Look at all these. - Okay, it's not my fault. Well, whose fault... Did he write all these winky faces? - You wrote that, so that's... You're clearly leading him on. - You know what? No. No. No. How long ago did you break up with this guy? Ew. Winky face? Not winky face guy, the four-and-a-half year relationship guy. - Oh. - Oh. The one. The one. Yes. Right. Mmm. Uh, two weeks ago. Two weeks ago? Oh, okay, I thought it was further in the... That's recent. Wow, I'm sorry. So the wound is still... Still fresh. Still bleeding. - Gushing. Yeah. - Still gushing. - Wow, sorry. - It's okay. If you don't mind me asking, what happened? - I do mind you asking. - It's okay. - Why are you asking so many questions? - I'm curious. - You can feel free to ask me a question. - Really? Okay. Yeah. All right. Have you ever been dumped? I actually haven't been dumped. I haven't. Lucky you. Yeah, I think it's... I think it's by design, somehow. In retrospect, I... I think I tend to date women who are... Beneath you so they won't dump you. I wouldn't use the word "beneath" me. It's not in them to do that, somehow. And I think subconsciously I'm aware of that when I begin getting friendly with them. Well, he dumped me, and... You know, it's okay. I think that everyone... It's healthy for everyone to be dumped at least once in their life. And also, you know, smoking pot helps. Have you been smoking a lot of pot? Yeah. - Really? - Oh, yeah. Like how... Like every day? All day. Real... Are you high right now? Yes. - You are? You're high right now? - Yeah. Are you? Are you really? Yeah, what? You can't tell? - No, I can't tell at all. - See, I'm a professional. - My mom is a pothead. - What? - Yeah. - She must be the coolest mom ever. Uh... I, uh... Yeah. - I wouldn't exactly use those words. - Okay, well... She smokes every day. - Wow. That's awesome. - Yeah. Okay, so what kind of long-term effects am I in for? Well, if you're anything like my mother, you could expect a... A general unawareness in how you interact with other people. Okay. I get that. And a false impression that your son is somehow your competition. Oh. - Mommy issues? - Maybe a few little mommy issues. I won't deny it. More than a few? A few more than a few. Winky face. Hey, how's it going? Hey, what's up, man? - For me? Oh! - Yeah. Take it. Thanks, man. Thanks. - Yeah, those are for you. - These look great, man. These look great. - Take a break. - Yeah. - Oh, man, everything's going good. - Yeah? Yeah. Everything's going really good. Can't wait to show you this new cut, man. The new cut looks amazing. Some of the best work I've ever done. Honestly. You're gonna love it. I hope you're gonna love it. Oh, that's great. You're a port in the storm, Darryl, you know that? You know, I come from a world of different artistic mediums that don't involve actors, producers, cinematographers or editors. Yeah, man. Everybody's got an opinion, you know? Can't be easy. All I wanted to do was make a movie about my ex-girlfriend. - I didn't know that. - Yeah. She was my first love, man. Now she's dead. Really? Dead to me. Wow. Well, if you want my advice, you got to be more direct with these guys. That's your job, right? Director. Maybe show up a little more. You know, at the end of the day, we're all just animals. We follow the pack leader. I'm really unhappy. I feel you, man. Like, taking Rodney's shit, for example, I love that shit, man. That was the first stuff I fell in love with off the bat. - Yeah. Yeah. - But we had to cut it. Nick and I, you know, we fought about that for a while, but at the end of the day, I trust his judgment, you know? Yeah. Wait a minute. Did we talk about this? I mean, hey, if you want that stuff in the film, you should fight for it. I'll follow you on that. I love Rodney the Doorman. I live large I make it work Yeah, I make it work Yeah, yeah Childish Gambino lame niggas never heard of it Sick Boi is the crew fuck these niggas with a dirty dick  Interesting. "Jamie Kirkland and her on-again, off-again boyfriend, "Sebastian Artise, were kissing all night. "A close friend says, 'They couldn't keep their hands off each other. "'It was like they just met.'" This is a week ago, bro. Dude, it's trash, all right? You're reading trash. - This is... Okay. - Bullshit, yes. Now how do you know? - How do I know? - Yeah. 'Cause I know. That's how I know, all right? We're friends. We're pals. Okay, well, this says, "A close friend." "A close friend"? Probably the writer's mother. Who's guessing. You're not friends with her, okay? I know you think you are, but Jamie Kirkland and you are not friends. You understand that? See, that's the thing. To you, she's "Jamie Kirkland." To me, she's just "J" Kirks. All right? That's even how I programmed her in my phone when she gave me her number. Oh, okay. You got her... You got her phone number? Mmm-hmm. Just "J" Kirks. Anyway, she told me about the Sebastian guy. It's nothing. - She told you about Sebastian Artise? - Mmm-hmm. - She told you about this handsome Sebastian Artise? - Mmm-hmm. - Did she? Yeah? - Mmm-hmm. What'd she... What'd she say? Do I tell her about you and Liana? No! Because she wouldn't give a shit, but also because it's private. I respect people's privacy. It's very private. And awesome. It's a good thing I don't care anymore, 'cause I'm not a star-fucker like you. See, Darryl, to me, a friend is a friend. That's the bottom line. A friend is a friend. I don't see fame and I don't see race. I'm not sure this is a good idea. Oh, come on. I've been playing with my dad since I was six, all right? He taught me everything. Look, ask me anything. Okay. Um... What is better? A, um... A full house or a flush? You know what? That's just insulting. Okay, it's insulting. Answer the question. What's the answer? I will have you know that I almost took down a celebrity charity event at the Mandalay Bay, baby. You're gonna be better than some of the people in there, you're gonna be worse than most, okay? So your best bet... Listen to me, is to play tight. Play very, very tight. Are you listening to me? Is this getting through? Yes, okay. Let's do it! Let's do it! Keep folding. Keep folding. Watch the table. That way, if and when you do bet, people will respect your bet. - Okay? - Got it. Don't bluff too much. If you got a great hand, play smart, but aggressively. - Don't let anybody catch up. - Wicked! - Okay? - All right, let's go! - What happens if we're in the pot together? - Uh, we check down. - We what? - We check it down. Okay. I need you to relax a little bit. I can. I can handle it. What the fuck happened in there? Well, you said to wait for a great hand and play aggressively. Yeah, not against me. I almost won, though. No, you didn't almost win. You were never gonna win that hand, ever. - Are you sure? Because I... - Ever, ever! No, I had a, um... Uh... - A full house. - Yeah. Which would have given me an even better full house. So, remind me again why you didn't win? 'Cause he got a flush. He got very, very lucky and he got a flush. Astronomically lucky. - That was $1,800. - I know! That was fun. - I'm glad you had a good time. - I did. And then after we drop her off, could we go to 71st and Columbus, please? Thank you. - You're done with me? - I am done with you. You are bad luck. And I got to wake up early and edit around your God-awful performance. Well, that's just rude. What are you thinking about? What do you think about prenups? Of prenups? Well, I'm just curious. And I won't be mad either way, whatever you say. I just think we should talk about it. Well, I can see why certain people get them, I guess. But in the end, they're not for me, I guess. Why not? I don't know. I don't know, without sounding cheesy about it, I feel like marriage is a solemn promise. You know, obviously I don't think it's a solemn promise to God or a higher power, but it's a solemn promise to you and to myself. And on some level, I guess I feel, uh... I don't know, maybe I deserve to lose half of my shit if I break that promise. - Or half my shit? - Or half your shit. But I thought I'm gonna be the rich one and you're gonna be the housewife of New Jersey. I thought we agreed on that. Because I kind of want one. You want a prenup? Is that okay? It's a little pessimistic, don't you think? Well, I guess it was more my dad's idea. I knew it was your dad's idea. I knew it the second you brought it up. I knew it was something your dad planted in your mind. What percentage of this decision is from something you feel or something that your dad has told you? Mmm-hmm. And 20% my dad. And... I guess the other 20% is just like societal influences. Okay. I'm glad you brought it up. I really, really love you. I love you, too. That hair's gonna light on fire. - We're not rolling yet. - Not very careful. I need my lawyer here right now. How's that water? Is it warm? It is muy buenos. Come on, are we almost ready? I think we're about ready to go, but we're gonna need a half an hour longer. Would you mind just staying where you are? I'm gonna be all pruned. Want a book? A magazine? Flippers or goggles? Manual freeze. Nip slip number two. - All right, mark that, but, uh... - Marking. This is fun and all, but we should really get back to cutting more minorities out of the film. What do you say? This girl must have some daddy issues if she's into you. No offense. She must have some problems, though. My impression of her is she's lonely, she's bored, she's going through a break-up, so there's some transitional thing going on. But, yes, she has shown an unclear but obvious interest in me. Fuck you, man. I was editing that day. It should have been me. It's weird. I've never had anyone like that be kind of interested in me before. All right. Let me be your conscience for a second. Do it. I would definitely do it. Amy's cool as hell, but I would definitely fuck this girl if I had a chance. Maybe even if I was married, which you are not. And not just because she's hot. Because she's famous and hot? Exactly. I just feel like, you know, we have one life. You know, like there's only one spin on this merry-go-round. And I know we disagree on this a little bit. Even though all evidence supports my side of things. - That's not true. It's not true. - It is true, but... - In my opinion... - Fine. There's nothing waiting for us after we die. In my opinion, that's it. Like, that's fade to black forever. And if so, what we're talking about here essentially is a victimless crime. Okay. Now, on the other hand, and I know you're probably gonna disagree with this because you don't believe in God. You're probably gonna roll your eyes. - I'm listening. I'm listening. - Like you're doing. But what if this is God testing you? Maybe this is God rewarding me. I can't hear what you're saying. Just calm down. What? Yes, this is... I couldn't leave any earlier. This is as quick as I could leave. I'm trying. I'm trying to get a cab. I'm going as fast as I can. It's rush hour. It's not that easy to get... Okay. Relax. Let's just calm down. Hey. What happened? What's going on, Amy? What's going on? Hey. Hey. It's okay. It's okay. What happened? Is it family stuff? Mmm-mmm. - Is it work stuff? - Yes. Did you get fired? No. - No. - What happened? I got a promotion. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. On the bright side of things, and I think there is a very bright side, you're the youngest person in the history of the company to get the promotion. You're getting an assistant all to yourself, and you're gonna be frigging rich. You know? You almost ready? Yes, I just need, like, That's what you said Okay, but I actually need 10 more minutes of you not talking to me, and I just need to send this e-mail. And if I can send it really quickly, then I can go. I just need you to leave me alone. What? Amy, can you look at me for a second? Amy, I'm proud of you. Okay? You make me feel like a jerk 'cause I just want to go out and celebrate great news. Thanks. You're welcome. - Let's go and celebrate. - I will. I just need to finish this. How long is it gonna take? It's gonna take two seconds... Who's that? What? Can I stay here tonight? Really? No. Fine. - Fine. - What happened? She kicked me out, man. So, go home. Go home? Home's mad far, man. I gotta go all the way back to Brooklyn? - This is right next to the office. - Is that Darryl? Hey, Amy. Hey. Do you have any weed? - I do. - Yes! All right. Just come in for a minute. Don't get too comfortable. Baby, look, all I did was ask about the night with that guy. All right? If you walked me to some girl's car, at 12:00 in the morning, and I didn't get back to you until the next day, you would have some questions, too. How do I know what you've been doing? I haven't been doing anything. I've been thinking about you. I am not stupid. Okay? I'm not stupid. I just got jealous. Okay? Like you get jealous sometimes. All right? And I think that's a good thing. Just be really, really sweet. And I wanted to tell you that I love you. Okay. Okay? I don't get you, Darryl. You know what the definition of insanity is? You. It's doing the same thing over and over, thinking that something's gonna change. I'm pretty sure that's not the definition of insanity. You don't respect me. You talk to me like I'm nobody, and, honestly, I am sick and tired of it. Baby... Did your friend come? What friend are you talking about? The friend that comes around a couple of days every month. Um, what are you asking me? I think I'm being pretty, pretty delicate with the way I'm saying it. Did your friend come, she usually comes around a couple of days every month, and brings a pad with her? Are you asking me if I'm on my period? I didn't say it like that. Baby? Liana? Baby? Muffin? You're misunderstanding what I'm saying. What I'm saying is, the sooner you acknowledge that it's over... It's not over. The sooner you can allow the healing process to run its course. There's no healing, there's no course. This is what we do. We fight and we get back together. Sorry. There's towels in there. And there's a washcloth and there's also clean toothbrushes, so help yourself to whatever you need. And help yourself to coffee or breakfast in the morning. Awesome. Thanks, Amy. - Goodnight. - Goodnight. I'll be right there. - Amy's the best. - Mmm-hmm. She is. All right, you need anything else? Nah, I'm cool. Um, just a bedtime story. A bedtime story? Yeah. Tell me a... What kind of bedtime story? Something entertaining, man. Something good. Come on. All right, I got a bedtime story for you. Once upon a time, in a land not that far away, there was a young girl who wanted to be a famous actress. The most famous actress in the whole world. But to make ends meet in this magical and expensive city known as New York City... She had to be a prostitute. She had to get a job walking all sorts of funny and eccentric little dogs. And then, one day... Okay, I get where you're going with this. She met a magical African American named Rodney. "Rodney, the man who opened doors," they called him. And she asked him, "Rodney the Doorman, "how do I become the most famous actress of stage and screen?" But poor Rodney. He could not help this young starlet-to-be. For, as it turns out, his advice was entirely superfluous, making him a character utterly expendable and forgettable. And therefore he was deleted from our fairy tale to strengthen it as a whole. The end. That story sucked. I'm right, you're wrong. Goodnight, sweet prince. Rodney could've helped that girl. What are you laughing at? Like you're the only person who mentioned it. Someone else could've mentioned it. Someone should've mentioned it. Seven Pounds? Seven Pounds? - Who was in that again? - Will Smith! Oh, it's a Will Smith movie. Yeah, Seven Pounds was one of the best movies ever made. One of the best movies ever made. I swear to God, Casablanca and Seven Pounds - I'm right. - That's a can... It's come to my attention that some editorial decisions have started being made without my awareness or approval. At some point, and I'm not sure when, you guys all sort of, ganged up, turned on me, and abandoned my vision for this film. I think it's shitty. I think it's immoral. And at this point, I'd like to just take the footage and go home, please. Fine, are we done? 'Cause I'm done. Let's just take a breath and talk this through. Okay? All right, let's talk it through, but just know that that's what I have to say about it, and you're not gonna talk me out of it. Okay, we've heard your statement, now maybe we can open up the floor and you could hear some of our thoughts. In all honesty, Adrian, you're not here that often. Okay? You're basically never here. And when you are here, it doesn't seem like you really wanna be here, especially when Mike is around, which is pretty much all the time. Clearly you guys have your own history, your own baggage, and I think that needs to be resolved, and that's a separate conversation for a separate time. But, I mean, Darryl and I, were basically forced to direct actors and create off-camera ideas for ADR session that you don't even show up to. No one asked you to do that. Technically, Adrian, I did. And I think we're doing a really good job. And I find out my friend's son was cut out of the film. No one told me anything. Adrian, watch the film without him in it and tell me if you honestly miss him. That's all I ask. All right? But it's your movie. But this can't go on for-fucking-ever. Look, I was sick. Jesus Christ, look at you, man. I was home, I stayed home 'cause I was sick. You come in with this fucking note, like a little kid who wants to get a day off from school. Adrian wants a sick day? "I'm sick." "You're stealing my movie." You're a fucking grown man. In front of these guys you talk to me like that? You know what? You don't get to me. You don't get to me. You want to get to me, you don't get to me. Maybe I should get to you once in a while, okay? I'm a decent person, you're not a nice guy. I'm fine with that. I think a lot of good stuff was brought up in this meeting. Um... We know how you feel now, you kinda see our side, so... I feel good. This was a good meeting. I'm doing my first film. We finish up, we have the wrap party, it's like a month after we finish. I walk in, and the first thing I hear is this guy screaming, "Hey, Jeremy!" So I look at this guy, I've never seen him before in my life, - but he's very excited to see me, yes. - To see you. And he says to me, "You don't know me, but I know you, "I've been staring at your face "for a couple of weeks." The editor. The editor. I know what that's like. You feel like you have this deep, intimate knowledge of these actors that you've never even met before. They have no idea who you are. That's the thing, you laugh with these people, you cry with them, you know, you go to battle for them, you do all this shit for them, and they have no fucking clue of your existence. I remember Jamie came to the office the other week. And I went through and I was like, "I know her, she must know me." - Nope. - No. I did not. It's like a one-way mirror. You know, it's like that movie, It's a Wonderful Life. Like, I go back in time and see all these people that I, you know, that I really loved, and they have absolutely no memory of me being there before. It's sad, in a way. You know? You gotta, like, double-Dutch, it's like double-Dutch, you know? Let the beat rock I'm losing control The piano man, he sound like Billy Joel Got music in my soul You know I don't play Be streaming downward Like strawberry back in the shade What's happened to empire Like King Kong Nick took Rodney out the film Can't we get along? What's wrong with you? Me, I got a lot of swag That's why I freestyle Fuck a pen and pad Catch me in the lab Runnin' the show Like Final Cut, I'm a fucking pro  You knew I was gonna end right there? That was so hot. - We got this... - type of thing. She's loving me. The one with the curly hair? The curly hair, man! Look. She's cute. I'm not saying I would, but I could fuck that girl. I could definitely fuck that girl. Listen, Darryl, I don't want to make this into a big deal. Right, every time you say that, I know it's gonna be a big deal. So I'm prepared now. - I'm somewhat ready for this, shoot. - All right. Mike had a chance to chat with me recently, and he wants me to cut his new film. Good. What's the film? Uh, it's some vampire comedy, I don't even know, he didn't really get into it. Like Vampire in Brooklyn or some shit. But, um, the reason I bring it up is because the budget on the movie is pretty tight, and it won't allow him to bring in two editors. Um, and I told him, um, that I'm not working by myself, and I'm not dropping my quote, and I said that flat-out, verbatim. Right, okay. Good, good. All right? So... - And he said... - What'd he say? He said he's gonna bring in a college intern. He's gonna bring in a student intern to do my job? That's what he said? Yeah. Okay, but did you tell him, you told him about what I do, about all the stuff that I really do, right? Yeah, of course. I'm not saying you wouldn't tell him, I'm just saying, you know, you were open, you told him, you told him that 40% of the work is probably mine alone. - You told him all that. - Yeah, yeah, I told him. Okay, I'm just, I'm just seeing if you told him that. I told him everything I needed to tell him, Darryl. I told him everything. I told him that, you know, we've been working together for years, that we're a perfect team, that we complement each other really, really well, and I told him I think that's a really poor decision, and that I'm not comfortable with it. Okay, but you didn't tell him no. No, Darryl, I didn't tell him no, okay? I'm getting married, I'm not in a position where I can be turning down jobs right now. All right? Honestly, I felt I was as loyal and as insistent in that situation as I could have possibly have been without losing that job, do you understand? Yes, man, I was just saying, making sure. I mean, that's, I get it. I get it. I totally get it. It's all right, man. All right, and you know, on the next film, me and you are co-editors the whole way. And, like, that's still completely my sincere intention. - I know it is. - Okay. - Hey. - Hey. Where'd Darryl go? He's waiting for me downstairs. He's gonna go see his girl. Mmm... I think I'm gonna split a cab with him. And it seems like you two guys want the place to yourselves. - Me and Louis? - Louis and I. We're friends. Thanks for having us. Of course. Do I get a hug? Yeah, you get a hug. All right, I should go. I'm gonna go. Have a good night. Okay. - Hey man. - What the fuck you doing here? I got laid and I couldn't go back to sleep. So I came in to work. Thanks. Let's play poker. What, you're gonna be mad at me now? Hmm? I texted you. Where do we keep the drives? Keep the drives? I don't keep them anywhere, man, I leave them right here. Where are they? I thought you locked them up overnight, or something. No. Did they move 'em to another room? No, man. No. Adrian! Adrian! Adrian! Rocky Balboa? Italian Stallion? I get it. Dude, go away. My daughter's napping. I get her one day a week, and you're ruining it. Come on, man, let us up for a minute, huh? Let's talk this through like adults. Get off my stoop, all right? I trusted you, and you betrayed me, you snake in the grass! Hey, that hurts, man. I thought me and you were cool. This is, okay... This is directed more at Nick than at you, Darryl, but I've yet to see where your loyalties lie, okay? I have to say, for now, I'm a little disappointed. Look, Adrian, I don't get paid any more for being here right now. Obviously we're here because we believe in the project, Adrian, that's why we're here. Oh, yeah? So, what, you like the movie? - Yes! - A lot of it, yeah. What do you mean, "A lot of it"? Look, how about I just come up, all right? Nick will stay down here, I'll come up and let's just talk, all right? How's that sound? All right, you come up, all right? Not you. All right, stay put, bro. Just me. Oh, I got an idea, I just thought of something. Ready? Keep it still. Keep it still. Keep it still. And... Okay, move it over. Yeah, look at that. That's yours. Let's write your name. How do I spell it? Um, K... K... - M... - M... R or A? - A. - A. Right, A. KMA, starts with KMA. So, Kmara? - B. - Oh, Kmab, right, of course. I don't know what it is with this project, I just have this massive case of senioritis. I just don't give a shit about it at all, and I just, I don't know... I just can't wait for it to end. I don't give a shit about my job either. I've been, like, online, looking for this purse that I saw on the street for the past two hours that I have absolutely no intention of buying. How are we gonna support ourselves forever if neither of us have a job? Have you thought about that? We need like a Robert Redford type with millions of dollars who's willing to, like, spend it all for one night with my body. How many years would that allow us not to have to work for? Ten years? I don't know, five? Five? With a body like yours, are you kidding me? We can get more than five years. I would say 10 years. Fine, 10 years. Oh, yeah, I think that's reasonable. But, you know, obviously I'd have to insist, that the sex be extremely safe sex. - Yeah, definitely with protection. - Like, double condoms. So, for one night, two condoms, 10 years. Yeah, that sounds reasonable to me. I'll sign off on that. - Okay, cool. - All right. Well, I'll hop on Craigslist when I get home, and we'll see what we can cook up. But you shouldn't forget that your job is really great and you normally love it. And it's a really cool job. That is true. Yeah, I hate my job, and I always have, and I really... I have no idea what else I want to do. Hey, Amy, I actually gotta, I gotta get going. - Let me call you back in a little while. - No. Don't go yet. Come on, please stay on the phone. Go find that purse. I love you, bye. Bye. Baby, that is some bullshit. I know. You get to work earlier than him every day. You bust your ass. Yeah. And there is one chance for him to stand up for you, he takes a job and basically says "Fuck you." I mean, let's not overreact. What, is he going to say "no" to work? He's getting work based off your work. That doesn't bother you? Of course it bothers me, that's why we're talking about this, it definitely bothers me, but you know... What am I supposed to do? Baby, listen to me. Some people are just meant to be in your life to teach you things. And when that's done, you gotta move on. You don't need him. I'm just telling you, this is gonna be a bigger... This is gonna be an issue. Okay, but why didn't you mention it before? Because the more I thought about it, the more it fucking infuriated me. That's why. I really hate when you speak to me like that. I really hate when you curse. I'm about to go to the airport. If we could just talk about this when I get back, it would really mean a lot to me. Your dad has no business getting involved in our affairs. - Okay? Are you listening to me? - Yes. And every time he chimes in, it's your responsibility to tell him he has no goddamn idea what he's talking about. - That's your opinion. - I know it's my opinion. Everything coming out of my mouth right now is my opinion. If you don't want to sign the prenup, that's okay, we have a lot to talk about it. I just really wish we could do it in a more civilized way. You know what? I actually do want to sign the prenup. Okay? I do. And you're going to look like a fucking idiot when I'm a director and I'm rich. Oh, you're gonna be a rich director. I'm sorry, that changes everything. That's a real game-changer. Laugh it up, have fun. You know, what's gonna be really funny? When your boss figures out you have no clue what you're doing at your job. That you have absolutely no desire at all to be there. That's gonna be really funny. - Have a good business trip. - Fuck you. - Have a good fucking business trip. - Thank you. - Why don't you go back to sleep? - Yeah, I will. I'm gonna sleep like a fucking angel. Hey, Jamie, how's it going? Good, good. I was just wondering if you had any plans for tonight. I was just calling to see if you had any plans for tonight. I don't know, maybe grab a drink or something? If you're up for it. Don't talk to me like that. You're being such a fucking asshole. I know, I know. Babe, I know, I'm a fucking asshole. - Yeah, you are, and you know what else? - And I'm working on that... Well, you're not trying hard enough. And you know what? If you don't get the fuck out of here, I'm gonna call the doorman on your ass. And I'll whoop his fucking ass. Come on. Look, I'll stay here all fucking night if I have to. Yeah, good, you deserve it. Can I get a blanket and a pillow or something? Get out of here, Sebastian, I mean it. I swear to God I will call the fucking cops on your ass! Is everything okay? Yeah, man, who are you? I'm Nick. I'm a friend. - Nick? - Hey, Jamie. Who are you? I told you, I'm a friend. Yeah, a friend who fucks her, obviously. - Shut the fuck up. - What the fuck? Are you fucking this guy? - No. - That's a bottle of wine. Have you fucked anyone since we split up? No, I have not. Tell me the truth! Have you fucked anyone since we split up? Because I haven't. Then what the fuck is he doing here? - I'm gonna go. Are you cool? - Yeah, you oughta go. - No. - She's fucking fine, dude. What am I, Latin King? - Bro, please, get the fuck out of here. - No, no, no, please. - Get the fuck out of here. - No, stay. - No, don't stay. - You, answer me. - Answer what? - What? Yes. If you can convince me that you haven't fucked anyone since we split up, I'll take you back. So we're gonna make two stops, Upper West Side, and... - Upper East Side. - Upper East Side. - Okay, okay, close your eyes. - Darryl, just... - You're peeking, man. - Just show me already. Who's it for? For? Come on, man. For Liana. You guys have been dating for like, four months. And it's going really well. It's not going really well, Darryl. Objectively speaking, it's going terribly. Okay, well, maybe the problem was that I was just going half-assed about it. - Yeah, I don't think that was the problem, man. - Trust me. You seemed pretty committed from day one. I thought you'd be happy for me, man. I want what you guys have. - What I have? - Yeah. Darryl, what you see of me and Amy is an illusion. It's an illusion that couples create when a third party enters the room. Okay? It's not real. Okay, when you're not there, we're not cuddling on the couch in our PJs, eating ice cream and watching reality TV. Okay? That's not what happens. There's a lot of fighting, there's a lot of power dynamics, okay? There's a lot of tension recently. Look at you, you get to sleep in a bed all by yourself... Alone. You get to wake up late, and no one gives you grief for it. - And never underestimate this. - What? You get to have sex with people you've never had sex with before. That's very important. Come on, Nick. Okay, I'm not fucking Brad Pitt, all right. I'm not fucking any chick I want. Give me a break, you're black and you have a six pack. I'm lucky to get a fat girl at the end of a night at a club, all right? And I know this, all right? Have you seen Liana? She's fucking beautiful, man. How much did you pay for that ring? - See, this is what you do... - Come on, how much did you pay for it? - No, this is what you do. - Just tell me. You ask me things that don't even matter. How is that important? - It matters to me... - How is that important? How much? How much? With the band? Are you talking about with the band? Yeah. Band, tax, everything. How much? All together, it was 38. $3,800. The band is custom made. How's it custom made if you got it two hours ago? It was custom made for somebody else, and then our love matched their love. I don't have to... Darryl, the ring is cursed! The ring is cursed! That's a sign! Oh, you're saying this? Red alert! Don't do this. This is a mistake. Darryl, listen to me, okay? Listen closely. A good friend... A good friend will say, "Congratulations, man." - Exactly. - Okay? - You've met a wonderful woman. - Yeah. - Who's going to make a terrific mother. - Yes. I'm not going to say that. I'm not going to say that because I am a great friend. Stop. This, I get it now. You know what it is? We just come from different cultures, man. - The race card. - Yeah. - Now you're playing the race card. - No, not the race card. - It's a culture. - It's always been the elephant in the room, and now you're going to play it. Okay. How about this, then? All right, listen to this. Why don't you call up one of your black friends - and ask them if you should get married. - I will. Good. Ask them. Ask if they think it's a good idea. I bet he would. You know what? You know what he would probably say? He'd say, "Hey, don't even bother getting married. "Just have a bunch of kids instead." - Okay, that's fucking racist. - Okay. You step out of bounds sometimes. - All right, all right. - No, no. You just crossed a line there. No. And you know another thing? This D-Money shit. Every time I come into a room you introduce me as D-Money. It's your screen name. I made that screen name when I was in seventh grade, man. It's a bit you do on me. It's not funny, man. - People love the bit. - Respect that, though. Just listen to what I'm saying, man. - Darryl, sit down. Come back. - No, man. Show me the ring. Darryl! - Hey, I've got your answer. - Hey. Great. I'm pre-coming. What is it? I'll work for half. - Really? - But I'll only work half the amount. - No, no. - Look, Darryl works days. I work nights. That way you'll get your edit twice as fast, okay? So you can either pay us now, or pay us later to re-edit someone else's mess. Okay? Either way, I'm not working alone. I don't know, man. - You don't know. - I don't know. Fuck you, you don't know. - Fuck me? - Yeah. - Fuck you. - You fucking owe me. You owe me. How many times have I saved you over these years? - How many times... - How many times? How many fucking piece of shit turd movies have you given me that I made into presentable films? How many times? - Shit. - Mike, look. Just relax. Who else do you know that can do what I can do? Hmm? Can you just turn that off for a second. I'm so sorry to interrupt. - This is just going to take a minute. - What are you doing? Baby, I want you to have these. Um... I know we, uh... We have our ups and downs. Wow, you look so beautiful right now. But, uh... I love you so much. Truly, and... I would be honored to make you my wife. Will you marry me? - Yeah. - Yes. She said, "Yes." - What are you doing? - You said, "Yes," though, right? That was a real "yes," right? I didn't want to make you feel bad in front of my entire class. You said, "yes," so I wouldn't be embarrassed? You embarrassed me. How did I embarrass you? I proposed to you. I got you this ring. I got you these flowers. As much as we fight, do you really think we should be getting married? Yes. Look, think about it. We're good, like, That's better than most couples. And now you're pulling numbers out of your ass. I think that it shows some major insecurity on your part to compare us to other couples. Marry me. Okay? We don't have to get married right now. We can... We can take some time. Some people are engaged for, like, years. Then why do we even have to get engaged? Why can't we just have fun? And enjoy the time that we have now. What does that mean? You always say these things. I have no idea what you mean by that. Do you want to be with me, or what? - Honestly, Darryl? - Yes. I never saw myself marrying someone like you. And I don't want to lead you on, because I really think you are a nice guy. But I think that you have some major issues. Please don't cry. - Don't cry. - I'm not crying. I'm gonna go back to work. Hey, Mom. How are you? This is Nick. Your baby boy. I'm just calling to wish you a very, very happy birthday. And I hope you're having fun with, um... Marty. And if you, uh... Oh, that's actually you calling on the other line. Anyway, I'm just calling to wish you a happy birthday. And if you want to get together for lunch or something I'd love to see you. Um, the next week or so is good for me because I am actually literally just exporting the final file of this film that I've been working on. So I'll have a little bit of free time, and would love to see you. All right. I hope you're doing well and I will talk to you soon. Bye. How're you doing, buddy? Hmm? How're you feeling? Fuck everything, man. Exporting the final file of this movie. We're all done. That exciting, buckaroo? Feelin' a little better? Listen, if you need to take the rest of the day off I can finish this up on my own. Fuck you, man. No, really I can... Yeah, really. I'm serious. Fuck you. - Why don't you go home and just take... - I need to be here. Okay. Listen, I was going to wait to tell you this, but, um... - I spoke to Mike. - What did he say? He agreed to let us work together on his next film. I told him I couldn't work without my right-hand man. Turned him around. Just like that. How's that for loyalty? I don't care. I really don't care about that anymore. Isn't that exciting? Hmm? New characters, new stories. I don't care. I'm excited. I think it's going to be great. How much did they say they were going to pay? Shh. ...this is the third time I've come here, the first time you actually show up. We're working today, okay? Listen to me. You're fucking with other people's work. Do you understand? My work. My team's work. The talent. I'm the director. I shot the goddamn movie. It's my work, too. And it looks like fucking mud. I'm the director, and that's the end of this conversation. Say it again. - Say it again. - I'm the... - Say it again! Say it again! - I'm the... - Hey! What are you doing, man? - Who the fuck are you? I'm the assistant editor, mother fucker. Who are you? I'm the director. I'm the DP. Okay. Why don't you take a step back, bro, 'cause this has nothing to do with you. - It's between me and him. - Or what? Or what? - What if I don't? What if I don't? - Relax, man. Relax. - Relax. - Why don't you apologize to him? I got this. You apologize to him, man. - Talking to him like that. - Are you crying? That has nothing to do with this. We're a fucking team, man. - Yeah, that's right. - We got different jobs. But we're all a team. You like his job? You wanna do his job? Next time, step up and take it first. Until then, work for this guy, man. He pays you. It's making movies, man. It's supposed to be fun. We good? I'm gonna go smoke a cigarette. - Go do that. - Smoke a cigarette. I'm the director. Thanks a lot. I'm glad I know that, Adrian. How're you doing? Lighting in here looks like shit. Hey. I ordered you a spicy tuna roll, and me dos mojitos. We should hurry, though, because the screening's gonna start pretty soon. Okay. Look, I just wanted to apologize to you again. For everything I said to you the other morning. What? Can you hear me? I'm trying to apologize to you over here. No. What's wrong? Did you get another promotion? No. What is it, then? You're scaring me over here. Talk to me. It's bad. Like, we might break up. Is it something I did? Something you did? That's a little bit better. What happened? Talk to me. Well, a friend of mine sent me this picture that she saw on the Internet of you, and you were walking your dog with Jamie Kirkland. We work together. She came in for an ADR session. We took a break and walked Pizza in the park. I thought it was something you did. Well, I got really jealous and I... I decided to go home on my lunch break and I went onto your computer. And I know it's really fucked up and I've never done it before, but I read through your e-mails. 'Cause I wanted to see if you'd been e-mailing back and forth with her. Nothing happened with me and Jamie. Okay, nothing. Um... Who's Allison? Allison's a girl I used to date. She's a friend. She's a girl that you dated while we dated? She's a girl I dated when we met. Okay? I didn't date her after we committed to each other. Okay. Do you still see her, though? You know the answer is yes. Yeah. She's in the business, we're old friends, we hang out for coffee and shit, and talk. She's a friend. She's an old friend. Okay, but a lot of your e-mails seemed like they were more than just friendly. I don't know. I can't tell. From what I can tell, it doesn't seem like you're still doing sexual things with her. I'm not having sex with her. Absolutely not. But you're, like, seeing her and you're not telling me. And then you're telling her you're not telling me. As if you guys have this inside joke. - It's not... - I read through all your e-mails. I saw what you said. You're talking to her about how you like sex. And she's telling you how much she likes sex. That doesn't sound like you're just friends. You're, like, saying all this stuff. I've never heard you say anything like that to me. And, like, what about Jamie Kirkland? - What about Jamie Kirkland? - I don't know. Are you hanging out with her and not telling me? Nothing happened with me and Jamie. I'm telling you. Nothing happened. We never hooked up. Nothing happened... Well, have you ever hung out with her and not told me? She's part of the movie, you know? Like... Yes. When did you do that? Last week. Last week, she had some friends over for dinner at her place. She invited me and Darryl over. We had a few drinks. We hung out. Why didn't you invite me to it? I don't know. You were working, I think... You know that I think she's really cool. And I told you I would like to meet her if I could. I don't know. It was a last-minute thing... And Darryl had to... I don't know, okay? I don't know. What is there to not know? Look, I never cheated on you. Okay? - It doesn't matter if you... - It does matter. Okay? It matters a lot. So you didn't cheat on me, but what you're doing still hurts my feelings. And it doesn't feel good at all. And I would never do anything like that to you. Look, being a guy isn't always easy. Okay? There are... There's... That's not the approach I want to take. No. Look, I'm sorry. Okay? I'm sorry. Put this mother fucking dog on a leash. - Going well? - Yeah, man. Yes. Better than the last time. - Good. - So good, man. A lot of laughs. Maybe a couple of tears to come. The taxi scene fucking killed, man. I'm telling you. Good. I mean, it's not gonna win any Academy Awards. But the producers are happy, right? It's leading to more work. What else can you do? Mmm-hmm. What else can you do? Well, we turned this ship around, right? Sort of. Sort of, right. I'm gonna go in. Yeah? You gonna watch? I've got to sit with Amy. What's up? I've been a bad boy, Darryl. - Hey. - Hey. - How's it going? - Fine. - Are you sure? - Yeah. You wanna get a drink, or... Yeah. I'd love to. - Well, hello! - Hey, how's it going? Hey, stranger. Good to see you. Yeah, good to see you, too. This is my girlfriend, my fiancee, Amy. Amy, Jamie. Jamie, Amy. - Hi. - Jamie, Amy. Amy, Jamie. - I've heard so much about you. It's nice to meet you. - Oh, yeah? - Yeah. - I haven't. My name's Sebastian. - Hi. - This is my boyfriend, Sebastian. - You look lovely. Beautiful dress. - Thank you. - Nick, it's good to see you again. - Yeah. Good to see you, yeah. It's good. Um, great work. Yeah, you too. Right back at you. I think it played really, really well tonight. Well, I have you to thank. I think you're just good because you're good. It's what you do. Amy's trying to play it cool here, but she actually... She goes retarded bananas every time your show appears on TV. Big fan. That is so cute. Listen, I need some vino. Do you want to grab a drink? - Sure. - Yeah, you all got a lot to talk about, I'm sure. Thank you, again. It was really great. Yeah, thanks. Yeah, of course. Good to see you again. Thanks, man. Thanks for coming out. I appreciate it. Who would have thought? Who would have thought what? - Good talk. See you around. - Okay. Well, to be an editor, you're kind of the person who assembles the film on a level. And then, on other levels you're refining the film. You're, uh, creating tones. You're worried about pacing. You're cutting the fat. - What's the fat? - The fat, well... I think you can tell by the way I look. I know how to trim the fat, right? But seriously, we're sorta like surgeons, in a way. You know? We get in there, and we cut out the malignant cells. You know, we operate on the actual intricacies of... I don't know what I'm talking about anymore. Did you work on the film? No, my boyfriend worked on the film, actually. Ah, okay. Your boyfriend. Cool, awesome. - Who's your boyfriend? - Oh. Babe, this is Darryl. He edited the film. Rodney. Rodney the Doorman. Nice to see you, man. So you're the one who cut my scene out of the film. Well, the film was running a little long, okay? Two scenes long and no one fucking told me? - Just messing with you. - Okay. - Let me introduce you to my family. - You brought the whole family. - That's my cousin June Bug. - Hey, June. This is my other cousin. This is the editor of the film. Well, assistant editor of the film. Babe, he told me he was the editor. - I think I said, "An editor." - You trying to fuck my girl? - Absolutely not. She asked me... - Just messing with you, man. Okay. Okay, you're a good actor, man. Wow, that's beautiful. - That is gorgeous. - Thank you. Yeah. So, how long have you and Nick been engaged? We've been engaged for, like, six months. So, like, right around the time he started this project. How'd you guys meet? We don't really have a good story. We met online. - Really? - Yeah, like an online dating service. Oh, no... I've never done online dating. Yeah, well, I imagine you wouldn't need to. So... That's not what I meant. I actually would really like to try it. It sounds fun. Yeah. It's fun. I sound sarcastic when I don't mean to be. But I really mean it. I think it sounds cool. Well, you should try it. Yeah, maybe. Um, so do you guys have a date? Or a venue, or... I'm actually gonna go to the bathroom if that's okay. Yeah, it's right over there. Hey, man. Hey. - What's up, man? - How's it going? Good, good. You're up. Yeah, couldn't sleep. Yeah. Footage man is coming up with the drive. The first drive. Cool. Exciting. - It is exciting. - It is. Brand new start, you know. Mmm-hmm. I know. I'm not being sarcastic. I partitioned the drive, and I, um... I labeled all the bins and everything so we're ready to go. Good. Hey, I was thinking maybe I could crash on your couch a couple nights a week. - Don't do that, man. - No, I'm saying since... Don't fucking pity me. Since I live so far from this office, man. Brooklyn's, like, I'm asking you for rent-free hospitality, man. You gonna help me out or not? - Sure. Sure. - All right. You and me, and Pizza the dog. Two bachelors, and a bachelorette. Sure. All right. Footage kid's on his way up. Right now. Let's do this project better, man. I could do better. Me, too. We're getting there.
