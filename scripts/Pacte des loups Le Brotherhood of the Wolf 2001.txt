The world had no choice but to change... .. but the revolution has become terror and me myself will be taken with away. The certainties make people blind and mad. They can tear their hearts apart and make a beast of theirselves. In the year 1764... ...the Beast appeared on our grounds and made it his. One year later it was known far beyond our region... ...and people began to think nobody could ever defeat it. By his attacks the Gevaudan sunk deeper and deeper into the darkness. Stop... Who are you? What did he do? - He's a thief. And she? His daughter. A witch. I healed their horses and they refuse to pay. Do not listen. A word has no meaning here. Are the horses healed? - Yes. Go on. Welcome in the land of the Beast. And watch out for wolf-traps. Knight Gregoire de Fronsac... ...en the man called Mani were hunters nor soldiers. As taxidermist of the king.. ...the Knight in Paris the reputation of a freeminded and ...intellectual person. The one who was following him.. ...as his shadow was a stranger nobody knew of. When evening fell... ...they offered theirselves to the castle of marquis Apcher... ...who gave them shelter as long as their mission in Gevaudan would last. Our people are not afraid of an ordinairy wolf. The Beast is different. It flees from men like it knows it has to.. but it spares women nor children. Have you seen it? - No. How do you know it's an animal then? Those who survived gave that description. It's much bigger then a wolf and it doesn't fear bullets. I understand your scepticism. I don't believe in monsters either... ...but i had a report made for you.. ...of the crimes of the Beast. You can judge yourself. Grandfather said you were fighting the English in Canada... Yes. I went there to study the animals and nature. ...but i came back hurt and with the grade of captain. I arranged a hospital for the victims of the Beast. In an old abbey. A women from Lorciere. She came back from a party ...when the Beast attacked her. Help came. The Beast vanished... ...but it deformed her face... Tell me, Knight, how is Mr Buffon? And how are things in Paris? And The Innocent One? Read about it already? It is kind of late for philosophy. You're right. How about the theatre? Do you know actrices? What are they performing this winter? Put it right there. People say she is curtuous. I'm not sure if it's true, but they offered their charmes. Tell me. With this your curiousity will be satisfied. Mercurius of France. We only have the Post of Avignon. I will show you the sleeping room. He is sleeping over here. - Good. Goodnight, Knight. It's not Versailles, but the wine is good. Fat as a pig... Jackques has seen many wolves. What attacked him, was not a wolf. The snout was longer and the teeth were like knifes. If it's not a wolf, what is it then? A devil. - Knight. The Beast attacked a women in Saint-Alban. There. Don't worry Knight, nobody is here. Stop. What are they doing here? Son of a whore. Goodday, captain. Sir Marquis. I greet you. But be careful. There are traps everywhere. This is Gregoire de Fronsac, of the garden of the King. He wants to see the body of this unlucky soul. With your permission ofcourse. You treated my men merciless I did not know they were acting in your command. They were not. You did good and I apoligize. My soldiers are made for war, not for hunting. The intestines were emptied and now there is poison in it. What kind of gardener are you? When the Beast is dead, the king wants it examined... ...and save it in Paris. I have to stuff it after the hunt. Now I try getting familiar with it. With such jaws the animal should weigh 250 kilos. This time I will catch it. Before the first snow I will have it. If everybody helps, it can't escape. Did you see it already? - Once now. In 13 months. I shot it and hit it. It collapsed but got up instantly again. We lost it south of the Mouchet. Did it look like this? It had somesort of black bar... with stings Do you understand? Friends, let me introduce you the maker of the drawings. Knight Gregoire de Fronsac... ...the man comes from Paris to.. catch the Beast. His Eminence, the bisshop of Mende. His Eminence, the duke of Moncan His Eminence, the count of Morangias... ..and Mrs. Count and their son Jean-Francois... ...who has traveled a lot too... Good, mylord. Thank you, mylord. Mylord Laffond, our intendant.. ..and the priest of Saint-Alban, Henrie Sardis. Tell us, mylord... Are people talking a lot about the Beast in Paris? People even sang about it. - They should prey. Would captain Duhamel need Gods help? Who can without god's help? Duhamel disguises his soldiers in women. To get the Beast. What a strategy. - Duhamel does all he can. I think you're obliging. Duhamel is incapable. They destroy a lot. But the Beast is still there. Like taxes are ment to be for paying Duhamel... ...I rather give it to my servants. What do you think? Mylord Duke likes carp at, but he is a good christian. When you arrived, they were boring me... ...with the good God and all that holy talk. The pope would even have sent a spy... ...to see if the Beast has anything to do with the devil. Excuse me. Marianne de Morangias. Difficult, very difficult. Everybody was breaking their minds about it. Who is next? - Maxime des Forets. Actor. That will be easy. - Be careful. He's a Morangias... Mrs.. - Hello, mylord, we were talking.. Are you Maxime des Forets? What a pleasure. Good actors are rare. The Marquis was talking about you. - The Marquis? He wants to have a chronicle written about his family. He's thinking about you. - Is he? He is in a good mood. It's now or never. But act like you don't know and let him start talking about it. Mrs. excuse me... Aren't you ashamed? - My God. No. So, Mr. stuffer... do you like our region? Until now i only saw beauties. Or at least one of them. Do people talk about girls this way in the court? No... Something like this you should save for the innocent farmers. I would go to the court if there were women like you. Food is being served, Knight. Let's eat. I'll follow you. We were in Saint-Laurent for 12 days already when we found the most.. ..bizarre animal in our nets I ever saw The indians told me about holy fish... ...but I was convinced it was a legend. I saw a fish with the looks and size of a trout. ...but it's body was completely covered with a hairy skin as black as poison. A hairy trout? You're joking. - No, mylord. Salmo Truta Dermopilla, from Canada. That is really strange. - As soft as fur. Nature is extraordinary. The water will be cold... It proves the impossible is possible sometimes. With this discovery you earned a lot of respect. I doubt he deserves that. But I admit, Knight, you got talent as an actor. If I would have two hands, I would give an applause. Jean-Francois. Please excuse him, mylord. Your son is right, Sr. Earl, that animal doesn't exist. My embalmer in the garden of the King is very handy. So you say the Beast does not exist... ..and we are idiots? I only say that... people only used dragons or squirrels in books or poems. Lies are sometimes true if they are being told correctly. Watch out, mylord. We might not understand you anymore now. By the way, are you a philosopher? Or worse... an actor? I think the Knight is mainly someone from Paris. Enough about that Beast. Shall we do some riddles? I just made a poem. If Mrs. Earl allows... If it's not immoral. - Immoral? No, no. It's very chaste and sober. It's not far-fetched. Just popped into my head. It's called "The Wolf". ''I did't pay any attention to it. Without thinking of evil, I look at you Your secret glance strikes me. The wolf, the wolf, the wolf" Will I see you again soon? Do you have any other mystical animals? - U have an indisputable idea about me. Allow me to change that. - Try it. Will you be attending Duhamel's battue? - Yes. I forbid you. It's far too dangerous. Obediance is the first virtue of young women. That young man is right. It was on that day the biggest battue ever to be held in Gevaudan took place. The King promised 6.000 pound to the one who killed the Beast. Thousands of peasants and soldiers joined the hunters. During a few houres we forgot we were hunting the Beast. Everyone got a map and a place to assemble. We start at 7. Go ahead. My people have other things to do. Your generousity matches your courage and... Enough. I hope for your sake that we catch it this time. That's a certainty, Sir Duke. What kind of racket is that? A beautiful weapon, not? I had it made by a weapons blacksmith in Mende. You understand that i wanted it custom made. Look... ...even in Paris you can't find such bullets. I mould them myself. Silver? You fear werewolves? No, but i want to leave a signature. I'm a hunter. Its a passion that has cost me a lot. What happened to you? I've learned that some predators need more then a bullet. There's more to curing gangreen then a prayor. Has a bear wounded you? - A lion. made me travel alot. You dont know Africa, Fronsac. Gentlemen... my daughter is to blame. I'll bring her here. Punish her accordingly. A witch. The daughter of the devil. Look at her, a demon. She's sick, she's not possessed. She's not possessed. The Evil. The sign of the devil. Bewitched. Make sure she doesnt swallow here tongue. She will suffocate. She's not possessed. She's not possessed - I know Taxidermist, philosopher... And even a healer. Congratulations. She didn't come. Marquis. And the people? Supersticuous. Nothing different than this place. The Indians eat the heart of their prey, for its strength. Is that why they are savages? In Africa they eat the heart of their enemies. Sir Duke, Jean-Francois, move your people eastwards. There you are. - Your mother will be worried. If i had listened to her, i wouldn't be in the convent. I know you dont believe me, you're a freethinker. Not when one is in love. - Are you in love? Ridiculous. We hardly know eachother. You think that its about you? Marianne. She has to learn to ride like a woman. Practice never hurt anyone. My father never sees any evil. - My son sees evil in everything. People died here. How do you know that? I hear their screams. - Mani, stop that. He's right. There was an army camp here. When it was torched, Is he psychic? That's not needed. To observe is sufficient. When i was little, i came to play here with my brother. Weren't you afraid? He would protect me against the ghosts. Don't you like the hunt? - Is that a crime around here? According to indian custom, you steal someone's soul if you draw them. Does my soul interest you? Why on foot? Do you want to get mutilated? It's my fault. - I ask nothing of you. What was that? - Only a wolf. And what if it was the Beast? - I dont think it was, Marianne. Thanks. I hope the Beast is one of the wolves. They wont be eating anyone. What a special person. Where did you find him? - In Canada. It's... How does one say it. An Acad? An Indian. An Irok, from the tribe of the Mohawks. An Indian? A real one? He doesnt look like an Indian. Makre sure that you're in Saint-Alban tonight. We'll entertain ourselves with your servant. He's not my servant. What is he then, cursed? - My brother. How can you mix your blood with that of a savage? He who shares my discomfort, is no savage. Because of Mani i was able to escape from the English. I thought those animals were cannibals. As you can see, Sir Intendant, Mani is no animal. Would you be able to procriate with a woman of our race? All women are equal once the candles are extinguished. Yes, they're clear of mind. The Indians slept with white men and had children. We are equals. That's said hasty. It's a bit like with black men... What do you think of it, Sardis? Your bloodbrother must be a child of God. You had him baptised? - He didnt ask me. Good. You follow times closely. - Mani has his own believe. He was somesort of priest in his tribe. Do Indians have priests? They are lost. What is their believe? Every human has a conginial with the animals. A totem Nice, but i don't understand. Would you mind? Don't be afraid. It won't hurt. U... Kariboe... thats somekind of deer. Yes, a deer. What do you think? Am I a deer by the horns or by somebody else? And my dear Thomas? What is his.. ...totem? - Worm. A book-worm. A snake? - Snake? With the Indians, Snakes stand for wisdom Wise snake. And you, mylord Intendant? A pig. Away with those wrinkles. With those barbarians the pigs may represent nobility. Who is next? Sardis? - No. No And me? What am I? Half a lion, half an eagle? Change me in a lizard, so my arm will grow back on. Jean-Francois. Enough. What's wrong? Am I going too far? Let me, let me. Mrs., would you? Excuse me, but your tricks bore me. I choose to withdraw, before you start dancing on a ball. Good evening. That will relax you. It's not Paris, but it's the best Mende offers. And it sleeps better than in an inn. They are all for you, gentlemen. And we have a new... My dear Marquis, come. I'm expensive, Gregoire de Fronsac. Do we know eachother? - From here Gevaudan looks small. ltalian? A passage in this beautiful country. I got some money. Thats not the only issue. And? Who did that? An Irokese arrow. Your heart was not far away.. Maybe I am.. a man with luck. And that? A bear. And he didn't love me. You haven't seen anything yet. I have a dangerous job. Not all men have manners like you. That's a recollection on me. That is a scandal in my house. Valentine. What is this? - I don't sleep with wizards. What does it mean? - He got snakes on his body. Our reputation is at risk. It's nothing, it is an Indian. Not a wizard. I don't want Indians. - You hookers are difficult. And, girls? Who's going with the Redskin? I double the price. I like his sketches... - Well, everything is gonna be alright... Are you a wizard? Are you going to sketch me? If your not honest. Several weeks passed... ...and the soldiers could't find the Beast. It was the 3th winter under his lordship... ...and we knew the snow and the cold... ...just like our weapons, would not make it stop. Think about the threatens God announced through Mozes' mouth.. "I will come to you like a bear lost her welps" I shall tear your children like a lion.. and send the Beast that will consume you.. and your cattles, and will make... deserts of your roads." How long will you stay angry, Lord? One candle per victim. Do you really think we live in a rational time? Mercy. I ask forgiveness. Mercy. Bless me. What is it, my son? God punished me. My children are gone. I'm doomed. We're all doommed. Gather your men, we leave at once. Warn Mani, i see you on the way. Goodeavening, friend of the wolves. I'v got something for you. I would like to speak with you, Marianne. Alone. In 10 days my mother and father will both go away. I am not as free as you are. Bring me the torch. Bring the torch. The storm starts and they are tired. We'd better go home. No. Let's find the girl. I found the child. Captain, those traps you set catch more farmers than wolves. Your men are leaded by misuse of power. And since your chase the wolf has killed 12 times. I don't understand. It shouldn't have escaped. What? - It shouldn't have escaped. And you, Knight, do you know what kind of wolf it is? Gentlemen... The only certainty I have, is that it's not a wolf. A wolf does not attack people. I observed them in Canada. Maybe there the wolves are different. A wild wolf would attack anybody. If it gets frantic, it will die in 2 weeks. And still it's running around here for 2 years now. By the way, I saw wounds a wolf could never have made. And I found, in a body of a victim, a piece of iron. And? - And? No animal has iron teeth. Is the Beast not an animal then? Well, how do we catch it? As we are talking, it kills people. I think we should listen carefully to Fronsac. So, Knight, you think The Beast is not an ordinary animal. I'm glad you admit its something extraordinary. I don't admit anything Sir. I only have my doubts. Knight, do you have something left to say? No gentlemen. Gentlemen, I received this from Paris. Captain Duhamel, His Majesty was informed about your mistakes.. ... and I was asked to get you off this case. You and your men leave at once to your regiment in Langogne. Sir Beauterne is already on his way to Langogne. His Majesty gave orders to kill the wolf. ...and he is the only one who is allowed to hunt in the district. Gentlemen. Have you forgiven me? I would like to know my totem? Do i say that properly? I would say... ...a mermaid. You are never serious. I will ask your Redskinned man. And the Beast? Did you see it? No. - Don't you want to talk about it? I could only make some absurd suppositions. When I say the Beast is made of flesh and iron... ... that it can think and dissapear when it wants to. What would you think? - That our air would make you talk nonsense. People would think that it hides for me. You haven't been long here and you already want to be finished. Did you think the Beast would surrender that easily? Maybe it's scared of you. - Am I so scary then? You enjoy a lot more from a difficult victory. Jean-Francois said you wanted to go to Africa. It's a dream of a taxidermist who is fed up with the winter. And you? Don't you want to discover other regions? The women have more duties then desires. Do you see Sardis on the walls? Does he keep an eye on you? - No It watches me. Alone with you in the park. Who knows what will happen. Come, the priest will catch a cold. Goodnight, Knight. Goodnight, Knight. You're in love. - I don't know. I know. The maps? I didn't need them for you. Let us drink. To Mrs. Morangias. Why? Her brother was there too that night. Did you sleep with him? With him? He is not to be touched. He looks, he drinks... ...and when he's drunk, he talks in his sleep. Like all men. Do I talk in my sleep? What do I say then? Do you know how Florentine women keep their men at home? They give their husbands slowly working poison each morning. ...and each night an antidote. Men who sleep elsewhere will have a bad night because of that. A women like you doesn't need that. And by the way, we're not married. Make room for Antoine de Beauterne.. ...carrier of His Majesty, who will release the region.. ...of the Beast. Mylord, I am Gregoire de Fronsac. - Oh I remember. The servant of Buffon. The taxidermist and balmer. He sleeps with the intendant. We have an appointment at 2 exactly. His Majesty asked me your opinion about your report. Complicated fables... I think the Beast is a wolf. Tomorrow I will leave to investigate. I don't want you to join me. Why not? The King wants me to do it.. ...and me alone.. I don't need you to complete this. You'll find a letter signed by Buffon on the table.. ...and our beloved King. I am inferior to him. But believe me, it's not... I read your report. Don't waste energy for the Beast anymore. I will take care of it. You can go. Come, come, come. Come. A women from Lorciere. She came back from a party. We lost it south of the Mouchet. It just dissapeared. Knight, the Beast attacked a women in Saint-Alban. God punished me, my children are gone. No more than you I believe in monsters. His snout was longer and the teeth are like knifes. The only certainty is that it's not a wolf. It's not an animal? - A frantic wolf attacks everyone. How do we catch it? No animal has iron teeth. Knight, you have to come at once. I saw it. He poored poison and said satanic words. God knows how long this has been going on. Let him be. It's an Indian remedy. Only our prairs can save her But... She was not... A miracle. Tell me. What happend to your brother? A man with the Beast. - She doesn't know what she is saying. Yes, mylord. The Beast is dead. Ten bullets. It didn't survive. We brought the necessary. Start at once. That's not the beast. - Start. Mr. Beauterne is coming. Rediculous. This is not the Beast. - Like I said, Mr. Beauterne is coming. I dont like the way you work. - Bye, Knight. Leave us. And, Fronsac? Don't you like my Beast? What's the meaning of this? You know this is not the Beast. His jaws are twice as big as these. - You got everything to fix that. I must bring the Beast to Paris, and I got this wolf. You should make a Beast for me. Do you want the King to believe.. - No, Fronsac. I carry out his will. You should too. That would be wise. - Are you threatening me, mylord? On my age? You know who I am. ...and you're too intelligent to have yourself threatend. If you do your job, the king will be grateful. If you don't do your job he will be very dissapointed. Do you have everything you need? I'm counting on you. See you soon. On this historical day, I would first like to thank Knight Gregoire de Fronsac. The Beast is dead and we owe him our grattitude. But its especially thanks to you, Majesty. It has to be said... ...it's in your person the royal power lives. Only an animal can ignore it, but that animal is dead. There's very little to thank me for. Together with your power I only had to show myself briefly in Gevaudan... ...so that the Beast would seize it's fight. What's all this hypocricy about? Beauterne is executing his orders. We should do the same. What orders? - Mine. Fronsac, this is Mister Mercier... ...advisor of His Majesty for domestic affairs. He had the idea to send Beaterne there. So its you who we have to thank for this victory? Your scruples do you credit, but this is domestic business. Did you read this? You can no longer find this in the bookstore. Did you have it banned? - It mocked the king. If we had waited to long, it would've become tedious. So it is better to lie than to let lies be spoken. The truth is too complicated. To rule, everything has to be simple. The Beast was a problem. Beast gone, problem too. It will continue to kill. - No one will know though. That is what matters. His Majesty keeps himself to thanking you. He heard you want to go to Africa. In about 6 months a ship sets sail to Senegal. If you want, you can accomany it. And ofcourse we keep quiet about Gevaudan. Well, Fronsac? Officialy the Beast was dead. What really happened, is not mentioned in the history books. It has been assured that this will be kept quiet. Does he welcome us? - He wants to help us. Go to the castle, i'll come later. Fransec let Mani prepare the hunt. The Beast was not his only reason for his return. What's the matter? The house of Jeanne and Pierre Roulier? Straight ahead. The last house of the village. This is Jeanne, my wet nurse. Gregoire de Fronsac. Pierre, go get the whine. My mother checks up on me. They'll know you're here. To hell with that. I'm getting you out of here. I will no longer put up with my mother and Jean-Francois. I want to leave, go far away. Within a week we'll go to Paris. - Why wait? I'm going back to hunt. I promised to the Marquis. - I thought you came for me? Watch out. Marianne, go away, without running. Come closer... Look at me. Get over here you. Come here. Get over here. Come on. Go away, Marianne. What's going on here? Open up, Pierre. My God. Tell me, Knight, will we really find the Beast? I thought there would be more. I'm hunting a man. A man? The Beast is an instrument in the hands of a sick mind. A murderer works more discrete. - Correct, Marquis. The first mysterie of the Beast is its fame. It has to be discussed. There has to be fear. How do you mean? - This book was sold everywhere. That author says the Beast punishes the King... ...for his comprehension for the filosofers. - Bullshit. Who wrote that? I dont know, but the Beast has a master and i want him. Eventually your weapon could have use to us. On the condition that you wear it. And you Mani, what weapon will you take? - Mani doesn't liker fireweapons. Too much noise, too much smoke. Bad scent. Everything will go as planned, grandfather. Don't worry. We prepared everything. Tell about America, Knight. - America? Will you never go back? - Not all my memories are good ones. - And doesnt Mani miss his tribe? - His tribe no longer exists. When we attacked his village, the smallpocks had wiped it out. We had to kill the survivors, the women... ...as well as all the children. Only Mani escaped it. How? - The captain wanted a translater. I had to teach him our language. Three weeks later he killed the captain. Why didn't you report him? Do you know how he fought his battles? He gave his scouts dirty sheets and linnen. The Irokese bought them. And three weeks later we came by. Is that how they waged war? - Thats how we lost it. Where did he go to? Talking to the trees. - The trees? The trees talk. White men can't hear nor listen. See what, Mani? Do you want to learn? What's that? - An Indian host. At your own risk, Marquis. Does it matter? Depends from person to person. The indians say that one can see that what is invisible. So, Mani? - The Beast is in the forest. The wolves will help. - I don't see anything. Tonight we dance the dance of the blood. And the Beast will come to us at sunrise. It doesnt seem to affect me... The night called onto Mani and the spirits of the forest... ...in a language even Knight de Fronsac couldn't understand. The wolves brought the Beast to them. Don't worry, it'll be alright. It'll all be fine. I shall tend to you. I will do anything for you. Thomas is sleeping. It was close. I'm sorry about the Indian. What's that there? Tell me what it is. I need to know. Its a domain. A hunting ground. Knight... You have to rest. Hurry. Fire. There he is. Kill him. The Knight came from Mani's body. His thirst for revenge is far from quenched. But according to Indian tradition he has to help his friend... ...at sunset to go back to his ancestors. What do you want? There has been too much bloodshed here. You risk the worst if you don't leave. I won't leave, i have to arrange something. Is it worth your life? Sinds when do you know? - I have no idea what you mean. Come on, Sardis. How is this possible? How did it ever get so far? No one will believe you. Go away, Sardis. May God have mercy on your soul. And that the Devil may come get yours. You are under arrest. On the ground of the power of the intendant... ...I ask you to accompany us without resisting. That's ridiculous, lieutenant. Chef. There's a lady here who wants to talk to you. - Later. Tonight. Mercy. Mercy. Come on, get up. You got a visitor. Not in seclusion anymore? - Depends for whom. I'm sorry. Bring your guest some food. Why? - I ow a lot of people. You have to help me. I have to write to the King. You will be hanged before your letter reaches him. Impossible. I didnt stand trial yet. Here. What do you know about the Beast? - A trained animal... Covered with armour-plating. I wounded it. Sinds when does that interest you? - Two years ago... ...a confidential letter from Sardis was delivered to the Pope. He reported the foundation of a secret society... ...with the purpose... ...of making it known... ...and with all means defend the word of the Church: ''The Pact''. Sardis... He used the Beast. The Beast is... ...a warning for the King. Take the Lords power into account, or you risk the Apocalypse. The conspirators called themselves the Wolves of God. The Pact works for the Church. Sardis only works for himself. Truth made him mad. And Rome has no control over its organization. And who do you work for? I get payed to work and also to deny i work. And you? You know enough. Miss de Morangias. To what do i owe the honour? How are you madame countess? Be seated. And your father? Still on a diet? He loves good food too much. Mylord de Intandan, you had Knight de Fronsac arrested. Who would ever think that someone like him could fall so low. He's nor a bandit, nor a murderer. - I see. I'm sure he had his reasons. Those men might have killed that Indian. That's not the point. Even if it is so... ...a savage is not avanged with the blood of christians. I want to see him. Impossible. Good. We'll see how they think about that in Paris. Marianne, you don't understand me. Knight de Fronsac has... ...deceased... Anyway, he would've been hang. Actually, he was lucky. He was your responsability. Maybe he choked. Unless he caught a desease. - Liar. You're all liars... Be brave. It's God's will. Reverend... - Marianne... ...come, i will bring you back to the castle. - Miss de Morangias has to rest. Come on... - No. Leave me. - There's nothing more you can do. He already smells bad. Burry him quick. And forget the name on his grave. She threatened to warn the king. She's dangerous... Gregoire de Fronsac was burried that night... ...even before the news of his death reached Paris. No one knew what secrets he took with him into his grave. A few days now, the Beast has layed silent... ...but the sudden dissapearing of his most fierce opponent... ...was a gloomy omen. Hurry up. I admit my mistakes. I have sinned. Forgive me. Day and night i think of her. I can feel her heart beat in my chest. I want her to be on my side. - The Lord is testing you. You dont know what i'm going through. There are images, those damned images who keep turning up. Free me, Reverend. Free me. I beg you. For the evil that eats away at me, there is but one cure. No. No, don't drink. They want to kill you, but i will stop them. Who, Jean-Francois? Who? We'll leave, Marianne. You and me. What do you think of America? - Jean-Francois... You made me suffer, but i forgave you. Please, what are you doing? What are you doing? Stay there. Do you think I will hurt you? - Stay where you are. Please. Marianne, I need you. You saved me when i was ill, and no one else. I saw your face after my nightmares. Your hand that chased away the demons. You don't realize what I did to keep you close to me. Please... Don't reject me. Why? Do i discust you? You don't scare me. Go away... It's because of this... Don't worry, i will take care of you now. Look, no one knows. Only Sardis and I. Leave. Go away. - Why? Why? - You're not my brother. It's someone else who returned from Africa. Indeed, but its because of you I got involved. Without you all this would never have happened. Is this all? It's your scent, you're awfull scent the Beast perceived on me. We have the same blood, Marianne. When father returns, he will kill you. And if i kill him? He's been bothering us for some time now. Go ahead. Do it, do it. Go on. Why didn't you do it? It's not that difficult. Look. Stop. - Do you love me? Cut it out. Marianne, I love you. Brothers. The Lord has told me. The Beast shall return and announce the rebirth of our values. ...and a new France shall be born. We shall be the invisible princes. Because God is on our side. The people had not seen the wrath of God yet. The unjust reprimand of the King will clash with the terror of the rabble. And when it peaks, we will be able to enter an agreement with the King. If he was unable to make a Beast subject to him... ...what would he do if in every province... ...more Beasts would emerge? The hour on which we will reap what we have sowed approaches. Read the book of Maleachi: ''The lips of a preacher must keep the knowledge... ...and from his mouth one expects the lore... ...for he is the messenger of Jahwe of the army.. ''When someone idolizes the Beast... ...he will face the wrath of God, and he will burn in the fire... ...in the presence of the messengers, and his pain wil last... ...for all eternity.'' I come to name you before God. Genevieve de Morangias. Maxime des Forets. Gontrand de Moncan. Henri Sardis. Jean-Francois de Morangias. Fire. Bloody twats, you're all under arrest. Ghost that you are, I will cut you in half. Je dont have to hold back. - I didnt intend to. Too late, Fronsac. Now the Beast is immortal. But you're not. Sardis trained you and you trained the Beast. Your signature is a silver bullet. Marianne, look. Marianne isn't here, poor soul. You've united us for eternity. Line'm up, men! Stay where you are. Who do you think you are? Sit over there, you. - Well well. Not so tough now, are we? Where are you off to, robin. Go on. He's dead. - Now it's certain. And Sardis? Where-ever he goes, we will find him. Otherwise the mountains will take care of him. Shall we celebrate our succes with dignity? You've killed me once before. - To arise better. I can introduce you to Rome. Shall i accompany you? To late. I appreciate you, Fronsac. You'll have to make me forget my duties. Leave, before I change my mind. Marquis, what's going on? Marianne... She's with us. She's dying. Be gone. Get out. Everyone leave. Marianne. Wake up. Marianne. Forgive me. I love you. Years went by... ...but Gregoire de Fronsac and Marianne de Morangias never left me. The world that spawned the Beast is dissapearing... ...and i have to hurry to reach my stories' end. I can still see myself accompany the Knight... ...to the secret refuge of Jean-Francois... ...where the beast awaited its end. The old healer told everything he knew. Jean-Francois brought a strange kind of beast from Africa. ...which gave birth. He only kept one. The strongest offspring. Patiently and unrelenting he trained it to be the most vicious animal. And so the Beast of Gevaudan came to its end. And I, Thomas d'Apcher... ...am without doubt the last who knows the entire truth. The Knight asked me to accompany him to Africa. But the country had to be rebuild. ...and i kept true to my people and country. I frequenty thought of Gregoire and Marianne... ...during the peaceful years who lead me to old age. I never saw them again... ...but I rejoice at the thought of them being happy... ...far from here
