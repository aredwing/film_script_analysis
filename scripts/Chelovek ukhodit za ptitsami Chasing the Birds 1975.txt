I've seen it - almonds have blossomed in the mountains. Almonds have blossomed in the mountains, wake up! Why are you still asleep? Wake up, people. Quit yawping. Wake up, wake up, people. People... Wake up.. Almonds have blossomed in the mountains. Stop yelling. Wake up. People, almonds have blossomed. Why are you shouting? Almonds have blossomed. Dragged all the faithful out of the hay. who cares about the almonds? Hanging is too good for him. Serve him what he deserves. You, son of the drunkard, here! have some almonds! There you go, have some more! Leave the boy! And who would you be? Step away from him, now! Who is that? Some beggar stands up for the boy. Go along, old man. Go. Otherwise you'll get some of this too. Get lost, you.. Crazy old man.. Lets go. Beggar... Son, why did they do it to you? What have you done? How did you manage to outrage them? I said that the almonds have blossomed. So you saw it too? One poet described it like this: The almond has blossomed again in the mountains. And snow of my gray hair melts. I am glad that I've met you, son. Good luck. Farukh! Farukh! Are you alive? Farukh! I am a bad friend. You've been beaten and I was asleep. What a fool I am! What have I done, Farukh! Where there a lot of them? Four. Four? What a fool I am? Fool.. My best friend got beaten up. There you go... take that! Enough, get up. Why did they beat you? I shouted that the almonds have blossomed. So what? Who cares? That's not for the first time, right? Come on let's go, Khabib. Be careful next time, otherwise they'll beat you up again. Have you heard this song about almonds? No, I guess. The almond has blossomed again in the mountains. ..And snow of my gray hair melts. Isn't it great? Great... Old man told it to me. What old man? The one who saved me. Mother.. Why have you passed away so early? Why, mother? Farukh. Amaderya.. She's in love with you. Why me? Maybe she is in love with you? No.. You of course. I am sure. I can see that. Come here, Farukh. Sit by me, son. Today I've dreamed of your mother again. Here, have some wine. No, father. And you shouldn't drink either. You don't want to. You don't know that only wine takes me to oblivion. What oblivion, father? You're going to bring back memories of mother again? Oh, son... I'll never forget her. Come here, son. You are the only one left for me in this world. Heavenly abode awaits those who fear God. Gardens and vineyards. Virgins with freshly rounded breasts. Of age that you desire. Only those who have faith in this and will act beneficent, Only those shall dwell in the gardens of eternal pleasure. Amaderya.. Heavenly abode awaits those who fear God. Gardens and vineyards. Farukh. Do you love me? You don't? I don't know. If you want to kiss me.. come to the garden at night. beautiful.. Why are you so sad, Amaderya? Are you afraid that fiancs matchmakers won't like you? They will! You'll see.. You are my beauty. Please, smile. Farukh! Why don't you pluck our apples? I don't want to. I don't want to pluck your apples. I don't want to take something that doesn't belong to me. Come closer. You are close enough. Farukh. What? I love you, love you Don't do it. ..a lot.. Don't do it! Farukh, lets run away. Farukh. Why don't you say anything, Farukh? Say something, Farukh. I love you. Farukh. Steal me. Steal, you hear? I want to leave, leave with you. Ok. I will wait for it, Farukh. Hurry. stop pushing.. so good with eyes closed.. water is so good.. I could spend here all day. Soon our Amaderya will go far far away. right... that's sad. will you come to visit us? I don't know, if my husband allows me to. why are you peeping? where's my burqa.. Take that! Get lost! Get lost, you dishonest! Take that! Shameless! You didn't steal me that night.. Why did she say "Yes"? Why did she consent? Farukh, give me some wine. Check if there is something left in that jar. Empty. Nothing in there. Go to sleep. Farukh, give me some wine. Good night. Give me some wine.. Just a sip. A sip... of wine. What's up, Farukh? Lets go get some wood. What's wrong? What happened? He's dead. It's me.. That was all my fault. He begged me for some wine. And I didn't give him a sip. Father.. It's not your fault, Farukh. Forgive me father. He died because of me. I spared the wine.. spared a sip of wine. He died because of me. Father.. It's not your fault, Farukh. Don't cry. May his sins be forgiven, and his soul rests in peace in heaven. Amen. Pitiful man he was. Drank too much wine and died. He owed me a bowl of rice. And a bag (13 liters) of flour to me. Died.. He owed something to the landlord as well. They took it. Took everything. Took away the donkey too. Didn't even leave the bridle. Everything.. What kind of people are they? Ok, Farukh. Let them choke on that. I'll go away. I won't live with them. I'd better gnaw the rock than live with them. We'll leave together. Get up! I don't need the smart asses! I need the workmen, get it? Do you want to eat my bread for nothing? There's my bread! What are you doing? There is my bread. Take that! What are you doing? Ah.. you! Bandit! Let's run. What about the money? We've been working. Where's our money, Farukh? Let him choke on that! Ah, make the most of what we yet may spend, Before we too into the Dust descend. What? You mean after we die there's nothing left of us? And we turn into mere smoke? What do you think? If we find nothing to eat tomorrow. We'll surely turn into smoke. Don't worry. I have the nai. We'll earn enough at least for bread. We'll play on weddings. I can swallow 120 sheep in one bite. I can make love to 120 girls at once. I am Allayar Bai. I am the greatest and the mightiest! There is no one more powerful than me. Take your time, Allayar Bai. I can swallow 120 sheep in one bite. That's the real prey.. Got you, finally. Allayar Bai... monsters.. Come on.. Hem in the fox! Rattle her this way! Now that is a good gift. Why did they kill him? They are used to killing. They kill birds, animals. They don't spare people either. Farukh! Amaderya! Amaderya, I've found you at last Come with us.. No. I'll steal you. No. Why? You asked me to do it yourself. Remember? That night in the garden.. It's too late, Farukh. Too late? Here, you better take this gold coin. It might come in handy.. No. Take it.. I am coming. Here I am, father. I'll bring you some wine No... don't drink it, father. Don't do it, father. Why not me.. Amaderya.. Mom.. Khabib.. why did they kill the stork... why..? almond is in bloom... almond mom.. Calm down, Farukh.. Almond is in bloom why so early... mom. why the almonds blossomed so early.. Amaderya.. Mom.. you are so beautiful, mom.. The almond has blossomed again in the mountains. And snow of my gray hair melts.. You feel better now? Can we go? Let's go! Tell me when you feel tired and we'll rest again. Here you are.. In the castles where the kings once ruled.. There's dusty thorns that lost their roots. A top the tower lonely cuckoos moans.. Meet nothing else but emptiness of walls. Farukh, why don't we live here? It's so good here.. Hey, the water is so warm! indeed.. We'll fish here.. They also have gardens here. You know what? We can even build a house from typha stems. Well.. we can live here while it's warm. Besides, there are no people around, right? - True. We'll live here alone like hermits. Like great wisemen. I saw a kishlak down the river. That one is far off.. If we don't go there ourselves, no one will come. Not-being's water served to mix my clay, And on my heart grief's fire doth ever prey, And blown am I like wind about the world, And last my crumbling earth is swept away. Khabib, Khabib. Wake up! Listen.. Let Fortune but provide me bread of wheat, A gourd of wine a bone of mutton sweet, Then in the desert if we twain might sit, Joys such as ours no Sultan could defeat. Do you get it? Joys such as ours no Sultan could defeat. Whether my destin'd fate shall be to dwell Midst Heaven's joys or in the fires of Hell I know not; here with Spring, and bread, and wine, And thee, my love, my heart says "All is well." Got it? That's all about us. Who has no servants, himself is not a servant. That's well written... And thee, my love, my heart says "All is well." What a shower.. Hopefully there's no flood in the mountains. The rain is warm.. What's that? Look, a lot of them. Where did they come from? That's great! They're also hiding from the rain. Look! There's fish! Why is it on the shore? There is another one.. Must have been a massive flood in the mountains. That's good we won't have to fish for it. I don't want a fish like that. Plenty of fish.. Lets catch some with our hands. No. This fish is unfortunate. I feel sorry for it. Look! There's someone drifting.. I guess it's a girl. Is she asleep? Or maybe she is dead? No.. She is asleep. Let me go! Let go! Hey.. wait. Wait. Wait. Wait girl. Why are you running away from us? We wanted to save you.. that hurts.. let go.. let her go! What's your name? Gulcha. And my name is Khabib. Wait. I'll go and bring you a hazel comb. So you can comb your hair. Ok? They're all dead.. All.. mom.. and dad... Jalvatik and Belakhatik and Kumush.. There you go.. My mothers hazel comb. Gulcha, Khabib! Come here! The angels of life have arrived. Angels of life... They're so.. One who sees them will find his happiness. I've never seen the angels of life before. That means we'll be happy. We will be happy. and me as well? Yes! Help us, angels of life! We will be happy.. Mom. Why did you pass away so early? Why, mom? Hello. Good day to you Tell me. Would you happen to have some work for me? No I have nothing to offer. Maybe I can clean the drain for your. Where do you come from? I come from there. You came from there? So you are two on one girl there, right? Get lost before I beat the hell out of you, Now! Hey, are you a beggar? Look beggar... beggar.. Quit chirping! Back in the house, now! And you, get lost. God forgives.. Here, have some more. And what about you? I'm full.. So tasty.. Just the way we used to make it at our place. Where did you get it? I don't know, It came from the sky. Huh.. from the sky, you say? Sure! Gulcha, look at the sky. ...So many stars. Why are they twinkling? My father told me that stars are the dust of good people. Than that blue one must be my mother.. And the one near by must be my father. And those two are Jalvatik and Belakhatik. And a bit further away that must be Kumush. And what about you, Farukh? Do you have someone up there? My father and my mother. And what about you, Khabib? the same.. mother and father. It means we don't have anyone and anything. And no home either. How are we going to live then? Are we staying here for winter too? We had our own house up in the mountains. And a cow too. Don't cry Gulcha, we'll stay here only until winter. And then we'll go to Khiva. We'll start to work and you will serve us dinner. Of course I will. I'll get to all the household chores. You've seen the angels of life, it means you will be happy. Gulcha, look what we've got. Now we'll see no trouble. That will be a good meal. Look, there's plenty of it. Hold it firmly. No.. Not like that.. firmly I said. really big ones.. slippery one.. Gulcha, bring some salt. Right away. I need a rod.. like that.. give me one too.. there you go.. You see, that is the way it's done. There you go. I saw a man there. He looked so scary and.. bad. Don't go anywhere alone. Only with us. Yes, be careful, Gulcha. Don't hurry, Gulcha. A lot of bones there. Not bad. Tastes good. I'll sell this and buy Navai's verses for Farukh and a dress for you. You're so kind, Khabib. Gulcha, if me and Farukh would be drowning in a river, who would you save... first? You, of course. And why so? Because you saved me, when I was drowning. I'll save you and then Farukh. Gulcha! She will save me first. It's so chilly. Yes really chilly. And dark around Really dark. But now, for some reason, It's hot.. Hot. Shaikh, Khayyam and Shaikh Jami, Shaikh Nava'i and Shaikh Saadi If you see this from your world, help them. You spoke so much of love, and I guess they are in love. They have no one except you, help them, help. Well? They're here not far away. Two of them. One left. Is the girl there? Yes, she is there, master. Coward! Despicable man! Shut up! I wanted to buy the girl from you, offered the money first. Now you've got yourself to blame. She is mine anyway. You're afraid of me? of a boy? Tied me to a tree. I am alone and you've got so many men. Are you a man after that? Let's go to the river and fight there. Hear me? Or is it so that the highland customs mean nothing to you? I'll kill you! Hey, you! Untie the boy! Strange... I'm left completely alone. What do I do? Where do I go? Follow the birds, son. It's all easier for the birds. They're in the sky. And I am on the ground. How do I live? How do live here, where everyone hates, robs and kills each other? Why are they so cruel? Teach me how to live with these people. The almond has blossomed again in the mountains. Man must be strong, brave, clever and decisive. Be careful, jackals and wolfs come out in the mountains at night. Defend yourself. Once again. Good boy.
