Ten years later, despite the new railroad from San Francisco, Ambassador Sakaguchi, Lord of Bizen was to find that besides the peril of the voyage by sea, there were further danger to be faced on land, on theirway through the West.

Now when do we divy up? Like we said in San Lucas. Why not now, then we can separate. Hunt, you've been shaking like a tree full of owls right from the start. What the hell's the matterwith you? I got a bad feeling. About what? Just bad, that's all. Well look, Hunt, no worry, you'll get your cut Link will be sure of that. It ain't him I'm worried about. Meaning what? Meaning the both of you shut up. Gauche, make sure everything's all right outside. Anything you say, General. Then I want to check out that private car. I'm not worried about you, Link, don't get that idea It's Gauche. What about him? I don't know. That's your split, take it and go. Please Link, don't get sore. But before you go, if I were you I'd change my clothes your pants are wet. Alright, you tally. Listen in there, we got thirty guns out here. Thirty one., And whatever you got in there can't be much So, open the door. Maybe he don't speak English. Well, I sure as hell don't speak Japanese. Pablo speaks Latin He used to be a priest. Si, si. Ah, the hell with it, get Hunt We'll blow it up. I am Sakajo Bizen, Ambassador to the United States on authority from his lmperial Majesty, the Mikado, the Emperor of Japan I caution you both, I am on my way to Washington. My safe arrival is guaranteed by your government. Washington is quite a few hills away I'm coming in. Look out for these two. Samurai guards? In my service. Well, if you want them to remain in your service, better tell them just to keep their hands off those long knives. Well now, Ambassador, tell you how this works. You're being a foreigner in a strange land, me and my partner here, we look around, take what we want. You try to stop us, we kill you. There is no need to be destructive The money is there. Ambassador, you're a gentleman, enjoy your stay in our country. What do I do with these two? Well, unless you have some special use for men dressed up like women, let them go. All right. Sir, it's a gift for the President from my lmperial Majesty the Mikado. Oh, gold, real gold, huh? You tell your emperor, I thank him. Jump. Link. Well, makes a good butcher shop. You. Are you shouting at me? I want to know your name. You're lucky I don't shoot you. I ask for your name. In New Orleans I've shot men who didn'tlike the cards I dealt them. So why? I'll tell you my name, what good is it to you? I intend to find you, I intend to see you dead. I get impression that until today you've never seen a man killed by one of these. Gun Sword, we all die the same way. The name is Gauche. They were like brothers. That's too bad. The man who killed him, also tried to kill you. Yeah, so it seems. He stole from us Something very precious. A gift to your President from my lmperial Majesty. Too bad. It is a matter of honor that it be returned to us. You will lead my Samurai to that man. Nope You'll want to kill Gauche on sight, but I want that damned Frenchman alive. Atleast until I get my hands on that money. That will be between you and my Samurai You will leave immediately. I guess you didn't hear me, Ambassador. I'm not dragging some greenhorn around the countryside. Make no mistake, Karoda is no ordinary man. I don't care what he is Look, Ambassador, we don't have horses, and Gauche has a two hour head start and he's got 20 mean guns to back him up. Hell, even if I do catch up with him, the trouble just... Silence Each of these dots represent a day. I have given him seven days to recover the Mikado sword. In seven days, I will pass here again, the same train. Suppose he doesn't make it in seven days. For the disgrace of failure, he will rip his abdomen, kill himself. So will I We call it, hari Kiri. Well, that's something I'd like to see. And he might as well do it now, cause I'm not taking him. Then, he will cut your head off. That's something I wouldn'tlike to see. Just testing, yes sir. Just what I had in mind. You get around pretty good in those skirts Yes sir, I'm going to have to try something else. Wait a minute, now wait a minute. These tracks are going right around thatlong bend. There's no otherway out of this canyon, so we can save time by going right over the top. Ah, what the hell, just follow me, huh? Hell, let's rest, huh? I think I got it all figured. You see, ah you're a gorilla, and you're as ugly as a buzzard. Not only that, I think you're as dumb as a backward jackass. Who is more dumb? Me or the man who let's himself get cheated by friends? I thought you didn't know the language. Did I say that? No, but you never talked. The jackass has nothing to say. Well I think I like it better the otherway. Move. Hurry up. Like I told you There they are. Hell, don't you ever eat? With the stomach empty, it would be a disgrace to... hunger. For you maybe, yes Not me, I'm a pampered Westerner. All right We camp here. There. Ah Well now, the way I see it, you're a man of honor And so am I. Well, anyhow, let's make a deal. I promise I won't try to ah, escape, and I'll cooperate all the way in tracking down Gauche. And all I want from you, you see is yourword that you won't kill him on sight. Cause I figure I need atleast a whole day to make him talk. You will not escape. Huh, don't you bet on that You got to sleep sometime. I already did. Yeah, when? While walking. I don't believe that But you know, all I have to do is waltz you around for about seven days, at which time you'll belly stick yourself. Yes After doing the same for you. Ah, I can believe that, too. Give me those. What? The boots. Ah Oh wheeoo, that, that stinks Expect me to eat this? Tastes not so bad, pretty good. God damned mosquitoes, I can't sleep. There's mosquitoes all over the God damned place. Wrong, one mosquito. No mosquito. Come on, hurry. They cross down there And there as well Many houses. Means I'm not going to San Lucas. We cross here, too. Down there? Uh huh. Uh, it's your idea, so you go first. I had a dog, his name was green, never said much, but he was mighty keen. Shared my work and he sh... Son of a bitch. Damn. Some day I'm going to catch you without all that hardware. Some day, you won't need to belly stick yourself, I'll catch you. Well My luck's changing. Make a fist. Can't you even make a fist? Hell, you think I'm going to hit a man who can't even make a fist? You think you can do that again? Oh, most certainly. Looks to me like you're getting tired. I'll tell you what, we'll call it a draw. Beautiful. Beautiful? The horses. Ah, yes. Yah, yah, toro, toro. Five, six, seven Gauche must have paid them off and gone alone. What does he say? He wants the old man to tell him where he's hidden his daughters. He's not telling. Brave man. Stupid man. Come on, let's get ourselves some horses. Wait Wait. Now we're even Only I'm a little even more even than you. All right now, this is a horse This is the front, this is the back. And this is where you sit, if you want to go this way, you pull that way, if you want to go that way you pull that way, if you want to go straight ahead, you kick the horse and hang on All right? Thank you. Horse not so good, I see you took the best one for yourself. Wait. Hey you Here. Now where? I go this way, you got a choice of three other directions. I go with you. Not any more you don't, I'm equipt. I cannot find the man alone I must succeed. Karoda, that's your problem. I'm concerned about a fortune, that money is mine, I stole it. The money means nothing This is life and death. Well, it seems like the only thing we have in common is Gauche. But I'll bargain with you You give me yourword you let him live until I find the gold. You can trail along. No, he killed the Namaro, he dies the first minute I see him. You can suite yourself. Yourword you let Gauche live. No. All right, I'm going to drown you, you stubborn mule, I'll hold you under until you bust. Yourword. All right you, pest. Oh, hell. Well, if nothing else, I got myself a bath. You sure are one unreasonable man. All this hassle over a hunk of metal. Hell, you know when I catch up with Gauche, I could buy you another sword, I can buy you fifty swords. Samurai knife is service, Kodo Bushido says, be strong, have courage, sacrifice yourself for your master My fatherwas a Samurai. His father, his, his, his Four hundred years, all died fighting. There is great honor in my family. Yeah well, these days, alot of people have peculiar ideas. There's no need to strain yourself. Men needs ideals to live by. You can't spend ideals. But now, all is changed. Japan has big wars, big Lords, has become different country. Soon a great nation like yours, then Samurai life will finish. All must give up swords Become farmers, fisherman, become nothing, so I must succeed One last time, my master service. Well, it just might be. You understand, if I see you're going to kill Gauche, I've just got to kill you. I understand you must try. Alot of Gauche's men here, but no Gauche. Well, this does it. I'm not going to keep chasing tracks with the Commanche's on the prowl. Commanches? Yeah. Where are we going? We're going to San Lucas. But you said they would not go there. Well, I figure Gauche will show up there sooner orlater. Why? For the best of reasons, her name is Christina. We'll wait alittle. Uh huh. That's very nice, you're mighty generous. Yeah. Thank you. It was lovely. Thank you very much I sure like it here. Good night senorita, good night I'll be back real soon. Yes, I do hope... Real nice place you got here. Yes. Yeah Good night.

Someone to see you. Who is it? Can't you guess? Oh. Thought you'd be happy to see me. What do you want? To be near you, what else would a man want? Oh, that Gauche, he's got alot of style. Take your dirty hands off that. He knows how to treat alady. Much younger than me, too. Betterlooking and a hell of alot richer. Can imagine what you see in him. When do you expect him? When he gets here. And when is that? When he feels like it. Oh, that shouldn't be too long then, should it? If you want to know, it's been ten days Along time for a man. Christina, because of my fond memories of you, and because I know you have a fine practical sense, I'll bargain with you. You help me find where Gauche hid the friends of this big golden eagle, and I'll see that you get a hefty share. I don't know what you're talking about. My mistake. And you make plenty of them. Yep So it seems. What are you doing? You bastard, open the door, open the door Bastard. Let me go Oh you dirty son of a bitch, you lousy broken down gun fighter Oh. Oh, hey, hey Stop that.

Howlong do we stay? Depends, on when old Gauche gets the itch. Well, I've got it right now. I'm going to scratch it for you shortly. Three days to go I don't have much time. Maybe you ought to, make the most of what you got. This is Polkie, smells like horse sweat but it don't taste so bad. The idea is to drink it right down. Tastes like horse sweat too, I think. Come on Maria, give them some more. Ikodo Boshido has said that Man with big stomach is man with small mind. Oh, is that so? You have one more. I intend to. And one more, Maria.

You hear that? She says life won't be worth living until she sees him again. You think you can remember all that? Yeah, and I'll remember to tell him to leave you for me. You do that Move out. The mission, how far? A day's ride over that snow. You're a disgrace to your mother's rotten pigs. When Gauche is finished with you, I pray to God that he sends you to hell. Well that's a very religious girl. You bastard. You like this? Uh Makes me think of Japan. It must be very beautiful there. Yes, it is. This man, Gauche. What about him? What about him? All I know is he was a gambler in New Orleans, and that he deals cards with his left hand, shoots a gun with his left hand. Le Man Gauche they call him, it's as good a name as any. But why do you want to kill him? Notlike that, let me have it. The Japanese, where did you find him? On the train, when someone killed his friend Guess who? Gauche will kill you, too. Well, we'll see about that. You know, if you have been different to me If you had shown me alittle respect. You mean like the Frenchman? He cares for me All you ever cared about is yourself. Well, that makes you and me the same. Christina, you're a whore, you've always been one, you'll always be one. You always did know how to speak to a woman. My offer still holds You help me with Gauche, you'll get a fair share of the loot. How much? Enough to move you away from San Lucas, and let you live anywhere you want anywhere else. But don't you take too long making up your mind, because I'm going to change mine pretty soon. Give me my clothes. I'll give you your clothes, but first I want yourword of honor that you won't kill Gauche on sight. My clothes. Yourword. Don't know what the hell that's all about, but it sounds like it's coming from the heart. Well? Give me five minutes with him. Not enough. One hour Give me one full hour. I need one full day. Karoda, I need the time to make Gauche to take me to the cash. I want to be sure it's there. No. All right, you suit yourself. Turning blue. Won't be long you won't be nothing but a clump of ice, by nightfall you'll be frozen into the landscape and you'll never avenge your friend or never get your sword. You're going to end up in Japanese hell, a disgrace to your ancestors. You have my word, I will not kill the man until you say. Don't take it so hard, I think you're one hell of a man. I think you are one son of a bitch. Senior Gauche Senior Gauche. They all meet you Senior, they'll be there tomorrow By noon. Hey, what happened to the others? Where's Mace, where's Pepi? Gauche, Link's still alive. Oh, that's too damn bad for him. He's got one of the Japanese with him A real tough son of a bitch. Sure, but they all die the same way.

Hurry, come on. Okay, okay, take it easy. Horses. Hey the sword. Don't forget the sword. The villagers that were here had a choice, run orfight Looks like they ran. From what? Comanches, they came over the mountain, too. What are we going to do? Well, the Comanches would have taken what they wanted, so I guess this place is as safe as any other. And if I remember right, you're along ways from being a good cook. You get busy anyhow. Why should I, you get busy? You cook, you eat I cook, you get whipped and go to bed hungry. The thing I like about you Link, the older you get the sweeter you get, too Ohhh. What about alittle Pokie, I feel like loosening up a bit. No lmportant day tomorrow I want a clear head. Yeah well, that's what I'm about to do Clear my head. I will see to the horses. I can't go back to Pepita's place I won't I need a chance in life. I can't go on like this forever. No, I guess you can't Dark season gunman. Always some one new to come along to take our place. All right then I'll help you with Gauche. I thought he cared for you, gave you all sorts of respect. But he's not you, nobody is I'll go along with you, anyway you want. Is that so? Uh huh. All right, get your clothes off. Now I take off yours. Leave Gauche for you. You fool, he outsmarted you, you'll never get that money. Don't move, I'll kill you, I swear I'll kill you Oh oh oh That's Christina for you, never know which gun she's going to reach for. Shit. You all right? Yeah, no hurry, she's headed in the right direction. Christina Christina Come back. Gauche Gauche. Christina, come back, Christina. We must move out.

No, no, I can't Oh No, help, help. No, no, no, no, no no Help Ahhh help, no, no, ah ah ah Help me, help. That's wet rawhide While it's drying, she'll slowly be choked to death. Get back. Thanks. Oh no, that band is so tight you just might cut her throat. You all right? Well, you cost us about two hours already, let's get out of here. Oh oh my God Oh oh oh Comanches, again? Yeah, they get around. So damned many tracks around here, you can't tell who's come or gone. But who's hidden over there waiting for us to show? I go first. No, I'll go with her, you hang back until I call you in. Sure wish you could use one of these. No need. Yes, there's a need Maybe some day I'll teach you. When your swords hanging in the White House and I'm so rich it's disgusting. Well, if old Gauche is in there, you're going to find out right now how much he loves you. Well, I guess we just wait. What for? Throw it, Link. You, what's your name? Karoda Juri. Well Karoda, looks like you found me You still intend to see me dead? Uh huh It's possible. Just because I'm the nervous type, the knives, put them out of reach. Check under his robe. Madre mia, look at this arsenal. Gauche, they saved my life I, I tried to escape but the Comanches caught me, and... Oh yeah? Thanks, Link What can I do for you? Well, you can give my friend here his sword, tell me where the gold is hid, and then you can take a high dive in alow well. Yeah, that's what I thought Hyatt wants you for himself You got a preference? Please, you can'tlet him do it, you can't Please, Gauche. Hyatt. Come on, Link, you're coming with me. Give me the sword. Boss, boss The sword, he wants the sword. What the hell, give him the God damned thing. Thank you. You all right? Uh huh. Don't worry. Well, I figure they'll either burn us out orwait us out. What did you do with your horses? Hid on the way up in the cane brake. Well now, that wasn't very damned smart. They won't do anybody good except the Comanches. What do you suggest? Gauche, I suggest you stay alive, I don't care how you do it, but you stay alive. Unless of course, you want to tell me right now where you hid the gold. Well, when the time comes, I'm going to have to beat it out of you, and that's all right, too. What do you think? Yeah. Hey, over here Oh. Hyatt's dead, so is Shadow. Yeah, the next thing that they'll do is set fire to this cane. You think you can chop a fire break? Yeah. Get back. Link. Help. Oh. Ah, ah Well Link, I'm still alive Let's get back to business. Kill him. No, no Link, you're not going to shoot me. Cause if you kill me, you'll never find the money. I know you too well, Link A quarter of a million dollars to be shared between you and me, you don't throw away that sort of money You're too cleverfor that. Tell you what, the money, you can have the lot The whole quarter... No, Gauche You keep it. You bastard, you stupid bastard Oh oh oh She say it Stupid No need to do that. You're wrong, great need. The sword All for nothing. Wrong again, because I'm going to see that that sword gets safely back. That's stupid Bad You close to border They catch you, hang you. Uh huh, listen, you believe that, you believe anything. You do this for me? You take it back? Sure Hell, I ain't got nothing else to do. All right. Here, I'll do it, I'll do it. What? Ah, oh oh, so, everything is good Ah. Yeah, that, that's right. You'll neverfind the money, Link. Oh, I know you, you'll keep on looking. But it won't do you any good. There is no one alive who knows where Gauche hid it. Except... I've heard him talking, once about something, and he stopped to pick up something. Something in small bags that clinked. If you want, we could team up together. Well, It's an idea. Then you'll take me with you? Sure. Oh good, that's wonderful. But only as far as San Lucas. Oh, you bastard. Now that's the Christina I'll always like to remember.
