Thousands of army men die is wars, many families face difficulties losing them, if we use robots instead of men, there won't be any human loss, producing Android Humanoids like him in great numbers, my aim to present them to lndian army. AlRD's approval for it is necessary. humbly request authorities and scientists must evaluate Chitti, and approve it. Dot. ls this robot created with Asimov's principle of not hurting humans? This robot wasn't created like that. Because robots would face situations in war where it has to kill humans. Let me check your colour and shape perceptions.

Team Tolly Save me! Don't come near me, l'm naked. - Don't come near. - So what? l'm also naked. Don't come. Leave me...leave me... l''m naked, leave me... Here's your Selvi. - You've spoiled everything. - Don't take pictures of me. The girl was naked. - She's alive. - Go... Don't take my photos. l've been humiliated... - Stop. - Stop...stop... What's this Vasi? You've killed an innocent girl unJustly. l told you it's a stupid machine. lt's dangerous to let it outside. You've proven now that l was right in reJecting it. - Bad luck, Vasi. - You've left us dear! Stupid! Don't you know to cover the girl with cloth and bring her? How can it know, Vasigaran? lt's not a human but Humanoid. How can you explain honour to a machine? - Professor! - Sorry Vasi. The video of the girls suicide is shown on TV news channels and tearing us. There's pressure from Defence Ministry. To stop your research. No professor, l can't stop. l can make some changes in his schemology and correct him. How can you do it? lt doesn't know man and woman, it doesn't know honour and shame, it's insensitive to human feelings. l can give human feelings to it. lmpossible. Only God can do it. Man has made possible many impossible things. You are my senior. That's why l'm telling you, it's a waste of time and energy. my 10 year hard work. lsn't there any fruit to it? There is but in a different place. l've contacts with many robotic companies in foreign countries, if you give this to them, l can get you few million dollars. No professor. l didn't do it for money. My aim is to give it to lndian army. lt's impossible. lt must come to me for evaluation. Give me one last chance. Please! All right, l'll give you a month's time. Try it, if you fail dismantle it. Sell it as Junk to buy dates. Good for heart. You need it. We both are sticking with you for 5 years in this lab. - All we got is beaten with slippers. - Find us any Job in your lab. Do you know anything about Chitti's neural schema? We know everything other than that, sir. l'll call if l need you. Human feelings Anger Excitement Team Tolly What are you doing? l'm installing software hormones to you. Hormones are secreted only with feelings, doctor. l'm going to do reverse mapping. Chitti, in this world human life is an independent accident, in this vast space and world, human and life happened on it's own by coincidence. What do you mean by life? lt consists of DNA, the basis of life. ls this life? Life is not a formula. How am l to tell you? A bacteria has life but sodium doesn't. - For me? - For you... Careful, this side. - Do you see any changes? - l do. What? Your beard has grown 0.5 mm. Stop Joking you fool! - l asked if there's any change in you. - No. Waste...utter waste...stupid! - Vasi, calm down. - You keep quiet Sana. Can it understand this? Metal head! Titanium head. Vasi please... l haven't eaten, haven't slept. l didn't even talk to you. How many days? How many days l've toiled you know? l've taught him so many things. How l struggled to teach him? He's standing there like a lamp post. Buffaloe. Useless fellow. Useless machine. l'll dismantle you. Don't scold me unnecessarily, l'm obeying all your orders. lf still l'm unable to meet your expectations, the mistake is not in me, it's with you. lf l'm waste then you're also waste. - What did you say? - Leave me. Leave me l say. Chitti is getting angry. Yeah. My God! Team Tolly Sana, Lata is having labour pain, she's in serious condition, come immediately. Don't worry, l'm with you. Don't worry. ls it very complicated, doctor? You're studying here, right? Fetal cause, the head is turned. lntestines are woven around stomach. Dropping pulse rate, blood loss, she has all the complications. lt's difficult to save one of them's life. She lost her husband soon after marriage in a war. She's living for this child only. Please save both of them. - l can only try, beyond that... - Can l try? - Who are you? Doctor? - No, l'm Chitti, a robot. - Robot? - Can you do it, Chitti? Why not? Sorry, we can't allow it. This is not a lab but labour ward. Two lives are under total risk. With so much experience this is a nightmare to us. l can do it, l've studied for Sana's exams. Sana herself can't do it. You need qualification and experience to a Ceasarian. lt's against the medical law. No need of ceasarian, l'll have it a normal delivery. How is it possible? Both will die. She's bleeding. We can do plasma transfusion. Blood pressure is high. She may get fits at any moment. Give maximum pressure. Pelvic disproportion. Normal delivery is impossible. Possible, can do symtiostemy. Olden times delivery method. Pushing through after stretching pelvic bone. Team Tolly Don't shout, your son is getting scared. We are making history. First time a robot is acting as midwife to deliver a child. Your son is Just like you. Do you want to see? Doctor, switch on Wi-Fi. l'll stream ultrosone video. My God! lt's unbelievable! lt's a milestone in robotics. lt's an achievement in artificial intelligence. Doctor! She's dying! - Just 95 seconds only, stay awake. - Sister, open your eyes and see. He'll take birth at exactly lt's over! Just 55 seconds more only! Just 35 seconds only! Sister...sister... Sister... Sister... Welcome! Great! Thank you. Will you approve Chitti now? Definitely. But the real problem for you starts now. He saved both the lives. Team Tolly You are really great! You're mind blowing! The real story begins now. Wait and watch! lt's a great day for me Chitti. What a moment! l'm extremely happy today. Thank you very much. Get charge in sleeping mode. l'll see you in the morning. Good night. Oh my God! You are... You are like... Team Tolly No! What are you doing here at this hour? A mosquito was biting your cheek. Did you come here to kill it? No, l felt like seeing you, that's why l'm here. What's this new habit? Get going. Your kiss today was very good. Give me another one. l'll go. What happened to you? Disturbing me at 1 am, go away. Kiss me, l'll go away. Why are you troubling me? You achieved something great, l kissed you. ls there anyone else pregnant in Home? ls this maternity ward? What do you want me to achieve now? Tell me. Catch the mosquito that bit me now. That's all? Team Tolly Who bit Sana? Not me. l was in Cooum. l'm West Mambalam mosquito. - Rangooski is from Anna Nagar. - Who is this Rangooski? - Me! - Did you bite Sana? Yes l did. So what? l've bitten Tamil Chief Minister also. Come with me and seek her forgiveness. Seek forgiveness? Fulfill my three wishes, l'll see then. Tell me your wishes. Number one, l want AB negative blood, very rare, difficult to get. Siva in my lab belongs to that group only. He always belittles me. Suck as much blood as you want. Number two, ban all the companies manufacturing mosquito repellents. They are disturbing us a lot. - Third wish? - Announce us as National Bird. Fool, you're not a bird. You're an insect. Getting late, will you come with me or not? l'll not come. lf you don't come now, l'll exterminate all of you. Hey who is it? How dare you enter our area and threaten to kill us! How many we'd killed with malaria, dengue and chikungunea, forgotten it? Let's show him our power! - Hey Dengue Lakshmi! - Sister! - Hey Cholera Jasmine. - Sister. Attack him! Sister, he's very strong. Cholera Jasmine broke it's sting biting him. ls it? - Enter his mouth at right moment. - Okay sister. Sister, Dengue Lakshmi died getting electrocuted. l think this is something new like electric mat. Let's back off like when we faced the first repellents, later on we can come back and have a ball. You can take Rangooski with you. Thank you. Look Sana, the mosquito which bit you. Rangooski. - Rangooski, say sorry to Sana. - Sorry. Never again dare come near Sana, warn your people. - Yes boss. - Go! Kiss me now. Deal is a deal. Team Tolly You want to feel my kiss... Boy you can't touch this...

Emotions for you is given as intelligence, it was for you to understand the situation and behave properly, and not to misuse it. l like this, l want Sana. Dot. What are you saying, Chitti? l'm going to marry her. You marry some other girl. You can't do this Chitti. l created you, this is known as betrayal. You can do this, Vasi.

You've the right to desire anything in this world. lncluding Sana. They say it's against the nature. No, this is new to the nature. - Sana loves Vasigaran. - Let her do.

Tomorrow l've army evaluation, l need to run my diagnostics and trouble shoot. Okay Chitti, all the best. You'll get selected in tomorrow's army evaluation, Vasigaran will get fame and money, he'll marry Sana and go to Kashmir on honeymoon. You'll be in the same Kashmir firing... ...buns! Who were you talking to? Myself. Are you ready for tomorrow's evaluation? Ready doctor. Peak of human intelligence is this robot. He's equal to 100 army men in speed, power and action. He can protect the borders and attack the enemies too. ln short, he's a one man army. l'm dedicating him to the lndian army. You must test it. Can you spot HV36 hand granade? Yes General! Smart. Can you bomb tent number 3 with that? What is this? Sana! Chitti! A virgin beauty who can make even computers to fall in love with her. What? lf she touches machine will turn into human. Human will turn into machine. What is this, Chitti? Throw it. Her tresses are black waterfalls! Forehead is neatly cut moon. Eyes are Bermuda Triangle where people get lost. Lips are sleeping zebras. Waist is small chair of toddlers. Next... Chitti, stop it. What nonsense is this Dr.Vasigaran? You said this robot will wage war but reciting poetry. - l'm sorry. - Friends, forget about guns and start praying dupatta, forget about canons and touch a woman's dress, Why wars? Why these weapons? Love will teach you to love enemies too. All of you fall in love! Chitti enough, don't embarrass me further. No war only love! Stupid scientist and stupid machine. Waste of time. You insulted me. What is this doctor? You've killed my ambition. Doctor, don't hack me. l took care of you like my own son. l want to live. Please don't harm me. Please. Rogue machines like you don't deserve to be in this world. Get ruined! What was my mistake? lt was my mistake to create you. Did l ask you to create me? Did l ask you to give me emotions? Did l ask Sana to kiss me? You did everything yourselves and when l want to live, you're killing me. ls itJustified? Don't talk! Leave me, l want to live. l want to love. l love Sana. l want Sana. l love Sana. l...love... Team Tolly Forget it Vasi, l'm also sad. Why are you still thinking about it? What if you lose Chitti? lt's Just a machine. You're a great scientist. You can create 100's of Chittis. l didn't take Chitti as machine. l brought you out to forget about it. Why are you thinking about Chitti only? You've to snub out of it. Divert your mind. l thought Chitti is my lifetime achievement. Oh God! Come, let's go for a walk.

You're responsible for that damages. We are registering case on you and take action. Sir, this is not the robot l had created. l had broken into pieces and dumped in dust bin. l don't know how did this happen. First we must find the robot and stop it. Tell us how to do it. l'll find out, that's my responsibility. Give me a minute. Why are you disturbing me? What happened to you? Your system has been corrupted. l must trouble shoot you, come to my lab with Sana. No way, l don't have to follow your orders anymore. - l had created you. - You dismantled me.

Come here with Sana. Nobody can destroy me. Sir, cash, cheque or credit card? Gun! Call all the police doing rounds in South Chennai, block all the roads from T.Nagar and ask them to check. Team Tolly Chitti has robbed City Centre, cover all around Mylapore area. - Go to Dr.Radhakrishnan Road. - Okay sir. Catch him...catch him... Received information that Chitti has entered Ennore petrol filling station. Robot is entering the harbour. Good, maintain distance and follow him. Coast Guard will take care of it. We've gathered the pieces of blown up robot. - This is not Chitti. - What? This robot is not my creation. Parts are different. lt's confusing. Robbed four different places at the same time. All four places are in different corners of the city. How could same person be in all the places? l suspect a man. Team Tolly Oh God! Nobody can destroy me. Activate command mode. l'm CR2. Speed 1 terahertz. Memory 1 zetabyte. - Command mode activated. - What are you doing Chitti? l'm producing myself, it'll produce many like us.

You're my queen. l've brought everything you like. l've brought everything you need. This is our bedroom. The place we'll spend together happily after our marriage.
