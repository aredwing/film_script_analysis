This offensive will become known as the Battle of the Bulge. The allied armies were pushed back nearly 40 miles. For those of us who lived within the bulge, Germany ruled once again prevailed. I am so tired of this mud. I blame the Germans. Mother. Pauline told me the village agrees with her about canceling the Christmas Eve celebrations again. And the other half still thinks we should celebrate. When we were liberated, it makes sense to celebrate but now that the Germans are back, it's too much risk. Christmas is God's day. We should celebrate no matter our conditions, that's not what you said last year. Last year was different. We've gone long enough without. Alina, this war will end and there will be many more Christmases to come. We should do as we've always done. Keep out of sight. We live longer that way. Oh, Peter. Do you think he'll give us a good price? He always gives us a good price. Gives you. Mother. He's a widower, and he's rich. He likes you. It's perfect. I'm not willing to settle on love for money. I have to feel something, and I don't. Jensen, we're a no-go. Again? I'm almost done loading up. Yeah, unload again. The entire front just got socked by a winter storm. The guys are having a Christmas party over at Mulligan's, you should stop in. They never let me in there. I'll make sure no one messes with you? Don't want all the guys not to care about the Sugar Ray fight. Ok, yeah. Maybe. Captain Myers. Berkowitz. Get that plane loaded up and ready to go. Sir? We're grounded. Not anymore. Hey Jensen, where are the pilots? They're in the hangar. Go find them. We don't have time to delay. Yes sir. Captain? I um... I was wondering if you considered my transfer to the front? I have and it's still a no. Come off it! I want to see some action, you know? Really help someone. I didn't become a medic to handle supply drops. You're an only child, Berkowitz. I want to see at least one of my men go home alive. Come on, hurry up. Let's finish loading up this plane, let's go. Captain, please. One week, even. We can talk about it tomorrow. You say that every time. You never know, tomorrow might be better. Excuse me, madam, would you like some wurst for your little boy? Ya, that's very kind of you. If I had known about the attack we would have stayed home. We never miss a Christmas together. The advance was unexpected. It's getting like that in Berlin. More and more people in the streets, hungry. Excuse me? Yes Madam? I want a few more slices of wurst, if you don't mind. It's my pleasure. It's that good? It's not for him. My father always says "if you want to win the hearts of people, "then feed their bellies". Kommstau Phillip. Merry Christmas, your steaks are on me. Here. Peter. Ah, Helena, Alina. I have the pork belly here, and I would like 50 marks this time, please. 50 marks? Fine, but I only do this because it's the Christmas season. Did you hear Pauline wants to cancel our Christmas celebration? I heard. Alina, I made you head of the Kerstavond and I think it's about time we celebrate. I would, but the risk is too great. We'll postpone another year. Perhaps we three could celebrate together here. I cook, we drink. That's a very kind invitation, but if not for the festival I'd rather stay home. Thank you. Gentlemen, sorry for the delay, I know this is short notice but it came down the pipe this morning so we had to move fast. We're currently about five miles behind enemy lines. The Germans are using two bridges to cross the Orr River here and here. You guys are going to blow the one located in Dasburg. So we infiltrate the Germans as refugees and then once we get to Dasburg we put on the German uniforms to gain access to the bridge. Affirmative. Now this mission is going to take both of you to accomplish. Timing the explosives on each side of the bridge is very important, it's the only way to get the bridge down. You guys are the best team of demolition experts I can find that speak fluent German. What is all of that? Are you writing a book? It's one of them dirty stories like in Esquire. Bigger words, Jensen. Bigger words. Here we go. Three minutes to drop... May Day, May Day, going down! Going down!!! Mother, the record player is too loud. It comforts me. I'm going to feed the animals. Oh, and make sure the oven has plenty of wood for the night. I don't want the animals to freeze. I know, mother. I know. Oh, come on! Meyers! I didn't think I'd make it. I barely got out of the airplane. Hey, where are we? I think we're uh- Help! That's Jensen! Follow me. Stay tight. Help! Help! Help!!! Keep it down, Jensen! Shut it! My leg, I think it's busted! You have to quiet down! Where's Lefeuvre? He didn't make it. But I've got his gun and his pack. Gimme that! We need to get Jensen to shelter, find some medical supplies. God, his leg is busted up pretty bad. No, it's ok, it's gonna be fine. Alright, we gotta move. Can you guys get him? Yeah, come on. I got you, let's go. Dubois. Halt! Alina? Don't move! Wait! There are no Germans here. Not here. Please, we- we are peaceful. You're English? Half. On my father's side. Bradford. My mother is Belgian. My family has always lived here, but we take no allegiance to the Germans. Do you know where the Germans are? Not here. I promise. Dubois? I've got a wounded man who needs shelter or he'll die. Will you help us? The barn is warm. We have a stove for the animals. If the Germans find out... Mother. I will not turn away a wounded man to die. Not tonight. Thank you. Do you mind if I check your home? Yes. I mean no, please. Come with me. Ok, I have to set the bone, close the wound, stop the bleeding. I need boiling water and some bandages. I'm Captain John Myers, this is Lieutenant Berkowitz, Private Jensen. We have hot water and I can make some bandages. The cottage is clear. Dubois, can you help her get some hot water, please? I didn't ask for help. We don't have much, but I'll do what I can. I can't delay any longer. I've studied the bridge, I can complete this mission alone. No, no, no. You know that's not true. The timing on those charges is too precise. Yes, but all I have to do is- Dubois. I brought some drinks. Thank you for your help. I would have done the same for anyone. Oh, this is very good. Coffee with a little chocolate. It was for our Kerstavonds. Kerstavonds? Kerstavonds. Christmas Eve dinner. A Belgian tradition. It's been a long time since we celebrated it. And this year? The risk is too great. Captain, Jensen is stable. I've set the bone, but he needs rest. But you can't stay here. It's too dangerous for us. Mother. She's right. We wait out the day, we move out tomorrow night. Sir, if we move him too soon he could die. I understand the risk. I'm not going to put this family in any more danger than we have to. No. Please, you will stay here as long as you need. I'm sick of this war, and it's Christmas for God's sake. It's time we start acting like it. I will be back with some fire wood for the stove and some food. Thank you. What about our mission? I can't just sit here. I will fill Lefeuvre's spot. You and I will complete the mission. But not before Berk says Jensen can move and we'll make sure you guys get across the lines safely. You guys get caught and interrogated you could compromise the mission, and I won't have that. Agreed? Oui, d'accord. But I don't like this waiting. Get some rest. I'll take first watch. You know that's a one-way ticket, right? Going with him? Get some rest. Captain, more coffee? Yes, please. Thank you. So you're from England. Bradford? Yes. My mother and I were on holiday here when the war broke out. I volunteered for the army after Pearl Harbour. I thought it would be good research. For? Captain Travis Mills in Liberties Fallen. A novel? War, mystery, a little romance. Well please read me some. It's still going from here to here. Your father? He's a professor at the University of Birmingham. We share the same passion, literature. Literature, as in... The classics. Shakespeare, Dante, Plato, Poe- Poe? You know he's hardly considered a classic. What do you know about that? 1941, Texas, A&M, Bachelor's in literature. Why didn't you leave? Evacuate when we liberated you last month? My mother was sick. Pneumonia. Have you heard anything from your father? Christmas two years ago. How does that make you feel? No man has ever asked me how I feel. Caught between two sides in a war that's not yours to fight, I wondered how it must feel. Lonely. You must have someone. Most men are unavailable. Love and war. I've loved with love that was more than love. But still, my heart hasn't found what I'm looking for. Poe didn't write it that way. My way is true. How about this? Tomorrow is the greatest thing in life. It comes into us at midnight, very clean. It's perfect when it arrives, and it puts itself into our hands. It hopes we've learned something from yesterday. Well, that's beautiful. Is it from your book? John Wayne. And I've told myself those words every night since my first battle, hoping that tomorrow might be better. And? I'll tell you tomorrow. I should go. What's your name? Alina. Alina Anne Hamlin. Alina Anne Hamlin, thank you. Good night. Captain Myers. Merry Christmas. Yeah. Merry Christmas. Morning. You don't have to do that. Oh, I'm not one to take advantage. Where are you headed? We need a Christmas tree. How's Jensen? He's still passed out. Alright, I want you to keep an eye on things. Hey, wait up! What if there was a patrol? They never use this path. When the war ends, what's in store for Captain Myers? Finish my book. Wife? Kids? Not yet. And you? When the war ends- I hope to be liberated. For the second time. Find my father, attend college as planned, then set up a primary school here in Wereth. I never had a brother or sister and I love children. I believe there would be no wars if children were taught tolerance and peace. A pacifist. A realist. War is not a solution. Here. It's perfect. It's tiny. Excuse me! It's barely above my head. Now look at this. This is a Christmas tree. It's huge. I know. No, no, no. It won't fit in my house. I can get it in. I like the small one. Nah, bigger is better. I'm not so sure. Trust me, I'm from Texas. Hmm... Do you have any decorations? No. Any raisins? No. Any nuts? Really? What do I do with that? Chew it. What are you doing? There. It's kind of small. Oh, come on. It's alright. We didn't get many gifts in the orphanage so we had to be creative. You can put it on top of the tree. Look at that. Mistletoe. Hey, wait up! So you were an orphan? Yeah, I never new my parents. They left me on the doorstep of the orphanage. You said the path was closed. I said they don't use it. No, please. Please. Let me speak with them. Go Hide. Please. Guten tag. Hallo. If they laid a hand on you I would have stopped them. We should get back. You'll catch a cold. I told you it was too big. Are you always right? Yes, and your enemies agreed with me. Nice of them to help out. You might have been right. Well, hmm... Ta-dah. Here you go. A star. The bath is ready. Ok. Here we go. Thank you. Here, take this. It was my father's. Great. To keep you warm while these are drying. Ah, so you're saying just... in the other room? Yes, right. Over there. Lovely. Is he ok? He fell in the stream. It's a good thing, Alina, what you're doing for them. But don't forget who they are. And who are they? Soldiers. Today they're here, but tomorrow they're re-deployed, wed or dead. It's not what I want for you. I was you once. I fell in love with a French soldier, before your father. We spent two weeks together. I never saw him again. It's better you love a scholar or a butcher. So, Peter. Yes, Peter. Peter will keep you safe, he will take care- What if I don't want "safe"? I want to dream that all of this is over. That we can take risks and look beautiful without fear of- I want to know love. Even if it's just for one fleeting winter night. Can't I have that? The animals are fed, mother. Thank you, Alina. My father's name is Henry. Can I show you something? Yeah. They were banned, so I had to hide them. Britolt. Poe. Hemingway. Karl Marx? Only to understand communist thought. My father said it was important to understand all ideas so we can formulate our own. Marx had good ideas but the communist system can be unjust to the poor, or the rich become a hidden ruling class, claiming everything is equal when clearly it's not. What? Wine is the most civilized thing in the world. Hemingway. "That the things of the night cannot be explained in the day, "because they do not then exist." One of my favourites. His words have such hope when plagued by tragedy. Happy endings aren't really his style. I hope to meet him someday. Who? Hemingway? Yes, of course. Here, let me get that. Thank you. I've had the pleasure. Of what? I met Hemingway. Really? What was he like? He's a big man. And a little bit introverted. Introverted? How so? Well, when he spoke, everyone listened because he never said anything that didn't need saying. I can only imagine. I'm putting on a record. One of my favourites. It's American. You must miss home. I've never had a home. What about Texas? I've never seen "home" as a place. Home is a refuge from plight. Two souls sewn together in love. It can't be created, it has to be discovered. And then held onto forever. I like that. Alina. Yes? Today is better. Sir? You better come see this. It's good to see you pull through. Yes, sir. I'll be fine. We can move out in the morning. The daylight is too risky. The night is too cold with his leg in a splint. We won't get far. I'll do whatever it takes. Really. I talked to Helena. She told me if we move North about three kilometers from here we should find the American seventh armoured. They held their position. And if they get pushed back? Jensen and I keep going alone. And if you guys get captured? You could compromise the mission. We won't allow that to happen. Ok, we move at first light. I wouldn't put her off. A soldier's life is expedient, my friend. And opportunity is in short supply. I don't want to hurt her. Captain, if I may? Tomorrow we could be dead or alive, but today, today is what we live for. For your travels. Just some small items. And here. No, I couldn't. Please... It will keep you warm and safe. Thank you. Oh, and if you follow this map you will... avoid the German patrols and it takes you to the front line. We've become quite good at moving around undetected. Thank you. Berk. Yeah. Thank you again for taking me in. I don't think I would have made it if it wasn't for you. Get home safe. Merry Christmas. Safe travels to you all. I'll see you around, Alina. Thank you, ma'am. You gave him your father's coat? What? He liked that coat. Well, he's not here. Where are you going? I'm getting ready for the Kerstavonds. But I thought you cancelled it? I've changed my mind. I'm done hiding. And this is going to be the best Kerstavonds we've had in years. I'm going to find Peter, we have things to do. Peter? Oh, thank God. Alina's map said the road would be clear, but I see three troop transports, three patrols and at least 50 men. So much for being always right. Pardon? Nothing. They're going to be caught. Come on. Oh no! A Farewell To Arms? Is this a joke? Is this a joke? No, sir. Not a joke. Who gave this to you? Who gave you this map? Get him up. We are going to Wereth to discover who drew this map. We need to shut down that bridge before they figure out their plan. We head back to Wereth. That bridge should be in the river right now! I'm not going to leave my men behind to die. We go back. D'accord. Alina? Here comes trouble. Pauline, how are you? Are you crazy? A party now? The war is only a kilo from here. Let them have their war. I'm having cake. But you agreed to postpone this. And now it's back on. Peter! Ah, Pauline. It's so good to see you. You too? But... but why? Why? Because I like to drink. But we could die. We could die sitting in our homes. I'm done hiding. It's time we take some risks. And we are going to celebrate Christmas. What is going on here? They are having a Christmas party. We are only here for the- Shut up! You! Do you remember me? Ja. Do you know these men? Nein. Does anyone know these men? One of you drew a map that takes these men back to the Americans! Someone is lying to me. If you will not cooperate... No, no, no! Please! Someone start talking or this man is dead! Please, stop! Alina!!! I drew the map. You're English. Leave him alone and I will tell you everything. Our laws are clear. Anyone who consorts with the Americana will be considered an enemy to Germany. No! Myers! Watch out!!!!! Myers! Incoming! Berk, come and get the woman. Dubois, keep them covered. She's unconscious! I'm going to pass her to you. I'm going to grab her legs. Ah, ah, ah... Got her? Yeah. Get out of the car, Myers! Hey, kid. Come here. Myers, get out of there! There's a kid in here! Myers, the car is going to explode! Myers! Come on! Kid don't do that! Myers! You want? Myers! Myers, the car is going to explode! Let's go get it! No! It is St. Nicholas, papa. Ja, Philip. Ja. Let him go! Tell your men to drop their weapons. Nein! Let him go, now or I shoot! You pull that trigger, you're next. Halt! No shooting! Myers, we got a problem! She's not gonna make it much longer! Surrender! I promise you will be treated fairly. 85 prisoners of war shot in the back! You call that fair? We shoot each other, then what? Your men die. My wife, my son. He was not to be here. Myers, she doesn't have much time! There's fragments in her chest! Mahler! Ja? Get my wife! No, no, no! Nobody move! Listen, you don't have time! If I don't help her now, she will die! If my wife dies, you die next! Doc? Yeah. Can you help her? I will not have him touch my wife! Is there a doctor in the village? He was shot last week! You have no option. This is the only man who can help your wife. Look, let's make a deal, ok? A deal. We call a Christmas truce. No fighting. No one leaves town until your wife is stable. When she is, we leave. No questions asked. A Christmas truce. How do I know I can trust you? All soldiers in the town of Wereth will not let allegiance to country dictate their actions. I agree to this truce. This Christmas truce. It will end when that clock strikes noon tomorrow. At that time I expect you and your men to be gone. Agreed. Please help my wife. Berk, that's an order. Ok, I need plasma and a med kit. Help us. Mahler! Ja. Quickly, hurry. Ok, let's go. Into the house. This way. I don't trust them. Well, we'll stay on our toes. Myers, go see if the Germans have any more plasma. She's gonna need it. Yes, we have. Ask Mahler. Sure. This is the last fragment. I've almost got it. Yes, yes, yes! I got it. Yes. Merry Christmas. My name is Obest Josef Braun. And I thank you? Captain John Myers. You're welcome. Butcher? Yeah. I saw American rations, beer, and French wine in the house. My brother liked to drink. Most of that is verboten. Yeah. Except today. It's Christmas. Celebrate. Yes, yes. Please. She's resting for now. Thank you. Wine for everyone! Hey. What if his wife died? What then? You took a risk on my mother's life, the village, my life. How could you? They were gonna shoot you. I had to do something. Do you know how we survived this war? By not taking risks! We blend in and they ignored us. We were safe. Then you came along... there was something in my heart, I couldn't- turn you away, but I should have. You gave me hope. There is no hope for us. Not here. After today, we will always fear tomorrow. Because they don't forget. They will return from Berlin carrying orders to kill us. And then what? Who will save us then? Who? Alina- No, don't. I'll save you. What is it? I don't know. Everything alright? Oui. Ok. Hey, Hans Mahler? Present. From FC Schalke? Ja. Schalke versus Admira Wien, you made like five goals that game. You were there? I was scouting for AS Monaco. Pierre. Pierre Dubois! Mais oui, c'est moi. Prosit! Sante. Ohh, ah! Prosit. Alina. Not now, mother. Peter. Yes. How about some music? Oh, splendid. Yeah. I think I need to get some more beer from the house. They're drinking it like water. I'll help. Ah good. Peter, right? Yeah. I think Obers Braun would like a drink. I have a lovely bottle of French wine inside. No, beer. German. I'll help Alina. Yeah, right. Why are you following me? Let me help you. You've already done that. And just like your invasion, I don't see you winning. Are you always like this? Like what? Firm? I've been called many things before but "firm" is not one of them. I will have you know that just because you're some American hot shot doesn't mean you can just waltz in here and sweep me off my feet. I am on to you. All is fair in love and war, Captain. Now you are playing both games and losing. Look, you stop it! What are you smiling about? I have it. I said, I have it. Fine, you have it. Thank you. I'm getting the beer. Here I go. You know, in the orphanage, Sister Love- Sister Love? Oh, now I know you're lying. Is that part of your book? Martha Love, actually. It was her God-given name. Sister Love would say to us "a wheel rolls two ways, forwards and back. But no matter which way it rolls, y'alls gonna end up somewhere. Best try to make it some place you want to be." Where is it you want to be, Captain? Home. But you don't have one. I'm not your home, Captain. I promise- Promise what? To keep you safe. Don't make promises you can't keep. I never do. Talk is cheap. Just roll the keg. You gonna let this guy steal your girl? I'm not sure she's mine. Fellas. His wife is stable. She'll pull through. Good job, Doc. Maybe it's time we start thinking about getting out of here. We made a truce. No one leaves until tomorrow. And what makes you think they're going to live up to that? Where's Braun? He's in the church. I'm going to pay him a visit. Hey, Captain? We were lucky today. Yeah, we were. Here. No, it's ok- Please, I insist. I never took you for a religious man. Yeah, well I grew up in east Texas. Bible belt. Went to Sunday school every week. You have Cowboys and Indians there? Yeah. Something like that. You know John Wayne? The same John Wayne who was in the Pacific? Yeah. I loved American cinema. John Wayne was one of my favourites. Tough guy. I hear when he's done in the Pacific he's coming here to clean up. I spent some time living in Brooklyn with my grandmother. I always desired to travel out west, but never found the way. It's just like any other place, I guess. I want to own a ranch and raise long horns and wear a six-shooter, ride horses. But before the war started I was forced to return home. My father was a patriot, never cared much for the Nazis. But Germany is our homeland. We have our duties. Well, there are some things- that men just can't run away from. John Wayne, you're very good. You're not bad yourself. I never had a chance to thank you for saving my family. Please. No, we are enemies. Duty should have dictated that we behave differently. Why didn't we? In France, I had an assistant. He was a young man they called Mufig. Smelly. And he loved the smell of old lady's perfume. He would douse himself in the stuff. Then one night, after a night out, this old lady comes up to Mufig and compliments him on his smell. Mufig proceeds to ask the old lady out. She accepts and they go on a date. Mufig comes back from the date and he can't stop proclaiming his love. "I love her, I love her". We all think he's lost his mind. I've come to find out that this old lady had a daughter the same age as Mufig. Beautiful. Four days later they were married. When I asked him why he would do such a thing, he told me he wanted to know what it was like to experience true love before he died. Weeks later Mufig put himself between me and a grenade. Saved my life. I've never known true love. Was he right? Myers, my wife is the most important thing in the world to me. I would do anything for her, even betray my country. So yes, to die and to not know true love is a tragedy. Myers, I think one day I will have that ranch in Texas. Keep in mind my army is closer to Berlin than yours is to Dallas. Three aces. Oh, come on! Excuse me. Yes. It's Peter, right? Yeah. May I? Of course, my Captain. I'm sorry, Alina, he outranks me. Thank you. I'm sorry. May I have this dance? Very beautiful. You think charm and a smile wins me back over? No, ma'am, I was counting on more than that. You know, I haven't danced since before the war. I would have never guessed. And I guess you frequented the dance halls. No. I'm looking for more. Than what? A pretty face. Captain Myers. How can there be a tomorrow? Time must stand still and give us this moment a little longer. Thank you, Monsieur Dubois, for walking me back. You can call me Pierre. It was my pleasure. Thank you. Alina? Oh, I didn't think you would be here. The wine, I was tired so I came back alone. Yeah, the French wine always goes to my head. Where is Captain Myers? I didn't see him when I left. What am I, his keeper? I'm very happy that you met someone that you like. Who would that be? I wish you would find someone more stable. Stable! Mother, the animals, they still need feeding. When the sun rises. Daylight allows you to see things better. And you have either love or regret. Oh, Peter's borscht. Push me. One, two, three! Ok, I'm better. I'll be back. Are you alright? I should have worn my helmet. My mother will be back quickly. How? I'll sneak out. Alright. You better come quick. Goodnight, Captain. Goodnight. Carpe diem! Captain? Go get some rest. It's my watch. Hurry! I'm trying, I'm trying! I'm sorry, my mother was up all night. I couldn't get away. We don't have time, the sun is coming up. Time must wait. It has to. Alina! What does she want? Alina! What is it? Hey, what's going on? They're coming! Who's coming? The Germans! Outside of the village about 200 troops and a dozen tanks. They lied! What's all the excitement about? We've been double-crossed. We grab our gear, we move now. Halt! Reinforcements are moving in. Once they arrive there's nothing I can do. Now move! Wait! I have some gifts for you. Come on. I will help. Perhaps we'll meet again. In better times when we can be friends rather than enemies. I'd like that. Hey. Here. The American artillery. Why are they shooting at us? It's not us they're trying to hit. I've got something for you, as well. I finished it last night. War, mystery, a little romance... We have to go! Alina! We have to go! When will I see you again? Christmas Eve, after the war ends, no matter who wins, if you're willing and able meet me in the church at midnight! It's the best time! Alina! Down!! Alina! Alina!! Alina, come! Myers! Alina! Let's go! We have to go, let's go! How are we supposed to get across that? I think we lost them. Is he ok? No, he's not ok. His wound opened up. It's fine. It's ok. Captain Myers. I never thought love would find me, nor did I expect it to be dressed in a uniform. But I can't deny love has discovered my heart and there you are. Please, fight for me, John, and come to your home in my arms. Merry Christmas, with love, Alina. Hey. Hey Captain, how are you holding up? You ok? I saw her fall. I made a promise to keep her safe but she fell. Myers, let me go with Dubois. You take Jensen back, give them a report. I can't. Look, blowing that bridge is suicidal, you know that. You're putting on a German uniform, they'll shoot you if- I have to go back! What do you mean, go back? I have a commitment! Yes, to complete this mission! And we will. You meet me in Dasburg in the park near the bridge. I'm going back in Wereth as a German, they'll never know. Oh yeah? Then what? I find Alina and make sure she's ok. You can't go back! I made her a promise! You obey your orders! You don't make this call! They killed my family. The bomb fell, my family, I never saw them again. This is my chance. This is my chance to get them back. To make a difference. I will not let you screw this up. Remember your duty. What if you had a chance to save your family? Would you give that up in the name of duty? I promise we will finish this mission, but after I find Alina and make sure she's safe. The park near the bridge. Hey, Captain? Next time I see you, you'll sign that transfer report, right? Next time I see you we'll talk about it. Alina? Alina? I have served Germany and will continue to do so until the day I die. Berlin received word of your truce. Hitler should be worried about the allied counter-attack, not me. Your words are grounds for a court marshall. I will see you hanged. Do as you will. I will only abandon my men when I am dead. Herr Oberst. A message. I should shoot you now. I have a war to fight. If you're done, get out. This is not over, Herr Oberst. Hail Hitler! Verify this. I have. Reports have been taken by the Americana. Verify it again! I want to know the exact location and which American unit took them! Now! Myers!!!! You fool! What did you do with that...? What did you do with Alina? Where did you take her? I came for Alina! Please! Is that the American? Yes, I think so. Come, we must hurry. You took her! Shut up! Is she safe? Do not touch to me! Shut up! I told you coming back here would only mean death! Truce, please! I love her! I ordered the evacuation of the village. I sent Alina north along with my family. I just received a report that Americans attacked the unit they were with, and took them. For me, I ask that you find Lilly and give her this letter. Myers... for your life, promise me that you will do this. I promise. Don't come back. There's only death here. Now go, quickly! Halt! Halt! Would you like us to check for a body? No. That spy is our gift to the wolves. We have orders to go back to the front lines. Gather the men. Ja. She worth it? Yes. Promise me something. Let's blow this bridge and then go home. Yeah, I like the sound of that. I want this over here, please. And I want the beer over there. Peter? Ah, schnukifrutz. After the war I searched for John Myers in France but instead I found Lieutenant Berkowitz who joined me on his Christmas leave in hopes that he too would see Myers again. Never thought I'd be back here. It's rather surreal. Alina! Is it you? Peter. Alina. How are you? Alina! And you! Hello there. So surprised to see you! Alina found me in France. Did you two marry? Our anniversary is next week. Lovely. Have you seen Captain John Myers? I thought maybe... I'm sorry, Alina, but I saw Myers after you left. We believe Braun killed him. That can't be. That's impossible. No, he was reported missing after the bridge in Dasburg fell. I know what I saw. We heard the gunshots. Alina Anne! Father? I thought I'd never see you again! I prayed every night that I would hold you again. What a wonderful Christmas gift! Alina! We were so happy to get your message. You look marvelous. Ya. Henry. Peter! Oh, my goodness. And they have appointed Peter mayor for now. That's wonderful news! Isn't it, Alina? Alina? Sorry. I was to meet someone tonight. Ah, the American. Yes, your mother told me about him. I don't suppose he's come round yet? The army believes he destroyed the bridge in Dasburg, but maybe they were wrong. Well then, the boy's a hero. Darling, no matter the outcome, you have been touched by love. That reminds me of the time I met your mother after the great war... Alina? Myers! Excuse me. Yes, of course. Myers? Alina! What are you doing in his coat? Why do you have it? You killed him! Killed who? John Myers! No, Alina. No! He came back to save you. He was dressed as a German soldier. It was my duty to kill him, but I spared his life. The coat, it was my father's, I gave it to Myers! And he gave it to my son. It has kept me warm for the last year. How is it you're here? I was captured by the British near Malmedy. They put me in a camp run by the Russians. It was a horrible place. Last week they dragged me and three other men out through the front gates. I had seen it all before. The shallow graves. They shot the man to my left and then they shot the man to my right. But my bullet never came. They said to leave and I ran and I never looked back. I made her the same promise that you made to Myers. That we would return here after the war on Christmas Eve to be reunited again. I know. We were taken to France by the Americans. Lilly gave me this. I never thought I'd deliver it. Philip is in an orphanage in Mount St. Claire. Lilly has an infection. She's dying. She's probably already gone. God, look after those whom we've lost. And thank you for bringing back my father. Thank you for the peace. The peace. Josef? Josef? Lilly! Your letter. Death has spared me. Thank god! My son. Papa! Alina. I never did thank you properly. Another time, then. No, I must. My family is together again because of your bravery. I will forever be in your debt. But it wasn't me. Your love to Captain Myers saved us all. Too many good men have died so that others may live. Will you join us? Yes. In a moment. Oh, Peter. Not now. I loved with a love that was more than love and I found what was lost. Never will I lose you again. Poe didn't write it like that. My way is true. Jonathan Myers. They said you were dead. I was busy, first with the Germans, then with the Russians. Captain Myers. You know, it takes a lot of whiskey and cigarettes for the Russians to release a German POW. That was you? You freed me? But why? Why me? Because I made a promise. I thought you should give Lilly the letter yourself. Danke ma bruder. Myers. This is my father. I've heard a lot about you, sir. Oh, don't mind about me, boy. Men like you make a difference. I was just doing my part. A toast to Captain Myers. No, no, no. To my family! Say now, isn't that my coat? Ya. Danke. You. I have a gift for you. Open it. But it was burned. Only the title page so it's identity could be kept secret. Your words I kept very close to my heart. Thank you. I've been practicing these words for a very long time. I've been without a home. I never found refuge or what it meant to love. I once thought that my journey was going to be a futile search to heal my broken heart. I was wrong. That journey ended in a little town called Wereth. I found my home in your arms. No matter where life may lead us, as long as I can stand by your side and have the honour to call you my wife, I promise to always protect you. Please, give me this honour. Will you marry me, Alina Anne Hamlin? I don't ever want to lose you again. Why are they ringing! They toll for you! Merci, Dubois. Carpe Diem!
