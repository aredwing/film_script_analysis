Her force is such against her foes, that whom she meets... she overthrows. What ya doing, Hannah? Playing chess. Who's winning? White. How can you tell? Because when I move White Queen here, Black Queen has to move here to protect her King. Then, White Queen takes Black Queen. Then Black Pawn takes her, promotes to Queen, and that's checkmate. Playing that stupid game again? It's not stupid. See, that's your problem. You need to be out looking for a boyfriend instead of playing dumb games all day. It's not dumb! Stupid little girl playing your stupid little games. Hey! Clean up the house, it's a mess. You are not the boss of me. I'm older than you. - So what? - So that means you have to do what I say, you little brat. You sure you want to do that? Why not? You're gonna leave yourself with a weak defense. You know better than that. What's the difference? I'm gonna beat you anyway. That's like bringing a crab to a crawfish boil. That don't mean nothing. You gotta be able to wrassle with a grand master. I thought you were the state champion once. Yeah, well, once was a long time ago. Oh, really, what happened? You know what happened. Don't get smart with me, little girl. I just want to hear you say it. Goddamn hillbilly crack, that's what. You best take my advice, if I ever see you around that shit... pardon my French... I'll whip your butt good... You understand? You couldn't catch me. Don't test me. Your Uncle Donny, he may look slow, but I can still run down a kid. Especially with chicken legs like yours. I don't have chicken legs. All right, how about moving a piece? How come you don't ever talk about daddy anymore? Hurts to talk. How do you forget? I told you, hillbilly crack. Point is, you don't forget, you just... move on. I don't want to move on. Hey. Oh, hey. What's up? - Nothing. - Do I know you? I don't think so, no. You sure... I've seen you around. I doubt it. You're in the Chess Club, right? Yeah. Funny. What? You don't look like a chess geek. And what do they look like? I don't know. You don't know much, do you? Be-yotch. You're still high. No, I ain't. You haven't slept in two days. Okay, leave him alone. Take a shower, you're disgusting. Stop... you're such a loser! - God. - No, he's not. He's a fucking drug addict, Hannah. Okay, stop it, Amber. Just leave him alone. Really? Come on. Hey! Amber! Hello, Hannah. I'm not supposed to talk to strangers. Oh, that's okay, I'm a federal agent. I'm not supposed to talk to the law either. Is your uncle here? No. Know where I can find him? No tellin'. I need to speak to him. Why, is he in trouble? Well, your uncle has gotten mixed up with some pretty bad people. Why don't you tell him to call me? Why would I do that? Well, if your uncle would be willing to cooperate with us, maybe we could work out some sort of deal. Let him off easy. We don't much like the law. That's too bad. Can I tell you a secret? Your uncle is gonna rot in prison like the rest of them. And you, without a legal guardian, well, they're gonna ship you off to a foster home somewhere. You tell him to call me, before it's too late. Hello? They said they were gonna ship us off. Hannah, he's just trying to scare you. Maybe he's telling the truth. What, a cop? Maybe you should just call him. If I so much as look at a cop, Frank's gonna have my head. Well, maybe he can protect you. Can't trust them, you know that. Frank's already got half the law dogs on his payroll. What if we leave, then? Just run away. Hannah, honey. Sweetie. You know I can't leave. I can't. Then please don't let them take my family away. At least what's left of it. I hate these things. Come on, it's your Uncle Frank. I don't care, I hate him. He's good to us. He acts like he owns us and everyone else in this town. Just try to act right. In Jesus' name we pray, amen. Amen. Heard you had a visitor today. Yes, sir. You know the rules. We don't talk to the law. I know. I promised your daddy if anything happened to him, I'd look after you, and I have. Part of the family, right? Yes, sir. Don't bite the hand that feeds you, you understand? I didn't say nothing. You know... you're looking more and more like your mama every day, God rest her soul. Thanks. She was a real firecracker, your mama. I remember, being the youngest in the family and a girl, she had it tough. Bobby here would torment her to no end. When she was 10, she had these baby dolls. Loved those things like they were her own children. One day Bobby stole them dolls, cut the heads off and set 'em on fire, right in the front yard. Your mama, she just stood there, staring at the little heads burning, tears running down her face, but she never said a word. Instead, she walked in the house, picked up a bat and whacked Bobby in the head. Put him in the hospital for a week! He ain't never been the same since. That's your mama. So, is that true? About mama hitting Uncle Bobby? Yeah, she could hit all right. That's why he's retarded. He ain't retarded, he's slow. Did you see the way he was staring at me all night? - It was creeping me out. - Yeah, you just think that every single guy wants to get into your panties. - Shut up. - You shut up. Both of y'all shut up. Women, goddamn. For an instant bond that stays strong, nothing beats Might-E Glue! No job is too big or too small for Might-E Glue! Might-E Glue is simply the strongest adhesive on the planet. Its patented chemical technology and advanced formula permanently bonds almost any non-porous material together. Might-E Glue! That's some amazing shit right there. Yeah, that shit will stick to anything. I should have invented that shit. Might-E Glue. Yeah. Hi, I'll be right there. Can I just get a coffee? Oh, yeah, coming right up. Thanks. You're welcome. You new? Oh, I just started nights. Where's Rose? She slipped in the shower and busted her hip. Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. You live here? Uh-huh. I haven't seen you around much. You come here often? You're awful nosy. Just being friendly. I work for tips, you know. Right. Um, cream? Uh-huh. So, are you a regular? Yeah, I come in a couple of nights a week. Thank you. Why? Food here sucks. Peace and quiet. Oh, you will get plenty of that around here. You got a spoon? Oh, yeah, here you go. Sorry, they're still drying. - Thank you. - You're welcome. Well. I'm Bill. Amber. Nice to meet ya. Likewise. Can I get you something to eat? Oh, no, just coffee. I hear the food sucks. All right, well, if there's anything I can do to enhance your dining experience, let me know. You already have, Miss. What are you doing up? Just thinking. You think too much. What's with you? I met someone. Another one? This one's different. You're crazy. What do you know? You're the stupid little girl. Your uncle has gotten mixed up with some pretty bad people. Goddamn hillbilly crack. He's got all the local law dogs on his payroll. Cut the heads off, set 'em on fire. He's a fucking drug addict, Hannah. Your uncle is gonna rot in prison. I can't leave. Don't bite the hand... They're gonna ship you off to a foster home somewhere. Foster home, foster home, foster home... Auditions are Thursday, honey. Oh, no, I'm looking for my Uncle Frank. So... what can I do for you? Well, you said if I need something I should come see you. What do you need? I need a job. I give Donny money. Yeah, I, I don't want any handouts. Okay? I want to earn it on my own. Sorry. I don't have anything. I was thinking... I could make some deliveries. Yeah? Yeah. Look, no ones gonna even look twice at some little girl riding around town. Especially the cops. I swear, you got your mama's gumption, that's for sure. How much is this gonna cost me? Twenty bucks per trip? Can I trust you? I'm family. Go see Donny in the morning, he'll tell you what to do. And I'll pay you ten bucks a trip. Thanks, Uncle Frank. Don't let me down, Hannah. Shut the door. Where's my fucking dope? Where's my fucking dope? Fuck that! You understand me? You don't fuck with my family! The pawns, poor pawns are silly swains which seldom serve except by hap. And yet those pawns can lay their trains to catch a great man in a trap. So that I see, sometimes a groom may not be spared from his room. Your daddy would never let you work for the Stinsons. Well, Daddy's not here. Hannah. So what's it worth, anyway? More than you and me put together. How much? I don't know, 20,000? Holy shit. Enough questions. Just deliver the package and get out of there. Don't talk to anybody. Promise? Promise. I'm looking for Mr. Owens. What do you want? I got business with him. Selling Girl Scout cookies? Are you gonna fetch him or not? Tell you what, you little shit. How about you get the hell on outta here before I put you over my knee? How about that? Then how about I tell my Uncle Frank you just said that to me. Thanks. Bill? Who's asking? Frank sent me. Frank's recruiting kinda young, ain't he? Look, do you want it or not? You're a pistol. You got a problem? No, Miss. Good. Now, just give me my money so I can get out of here. Hey. What you say your name was? I didn't. Ain't you the cutest little thing? Fucker! Look, I don't care. I want it now. Hang on a second. - What? - The money. Please? Here. Thanks. Look, I'm asking you nice one the last time. Don't make me ask again. I sure wouldn't want to be on your shit list. Eventually everyone ends up on my shit list. What's the matter? Huh? Nothing. I know that face. What face? A man who wants out. No. You can tell me. No, it's... It's nothing. What is it? It's complicated. My life, it's... It's complicated. I can do complicated. You know what I do? I don't care. It don't bother you? No, I just want you. The King himself is haughty care which overlooks all his men. And when he sees how they fare, he steps among them now and then. For when his foe presumes to check, his servants stand to give the neck. Hello? Hannah? Hannah! I know you're in there, I can see your bicycle. Hey! Hannah! Coming! Hannah! Hello. Ain't you supposed to be working? Yes, sir. We're not paying you to just sit around here at the house. Yes, sir. Where's Amber? She's working. Well, tell her I stopped by. Yes, sir. Hey. How do I look? How do you look? Yeah. You look fucking beautiful. Oh. Hey. Oh, hey. Hey, Amber, this here is Jackson. He's my right hand man. Hi. Nice to meet you. So, this is the lady I've been hearing about. I... I guess. What's up? I got some business. I was just about to leave. - See you later? - Yeah. Nice to meet you. Are you crazy... She's a Stinson. So what? So, Frank will have your head. I've got it under control. Do you even know who she is? Shit, that bitch has seen more helmets than Hitler. You don't know when to quit, do you? Hey, hey. Don't touch anything, please. Why? I'll tell you why. Red phosphorous, right there. Caustic soda. Benzene. Phosphine gas. Highly flammable shit. I mean, you mix them up, you've got a real shit storm on your hands. Shit storm? Yeah, one spark and boom. Like boom? Like boom! How do you know that? I just do. Where did you learn about all this stuff? Well, in my youth... I was really into science, you know? And school. Till I dropped out. Guess it wasn't a total waste, though. Don't touch anything. Okay. What's up? Not much. Hand me that wrench, will you? Torque or socket? Socket. Okay. Here you go. Thanks. Looks like a half-inch to me? Here. Thanks. How come a young girl like you knows so much about wrenches, huh? Oh, uh, my dad used to like to fix cars, and I always liked to watch him. Oh, mechanic huh? No. No, he broke more things than he fixed, I think. Your daddy know what you're doing? No. No, he's dead. Yeah, he died a year ago. Live with your mama then, huh? Nope, she's dead too. - Oh. - Yeah... I'm sorry. Okay. Um... This. Right. Here you go. Thank you. Okay. See you later. Later. It's your move. I'm thinking. Okay, well, are you going to think all day? It's just a game. No, it's not. Geez, Hannah, when did you get so serious? I don't know. You never use to be like this. You used to smile all the time. I remember when you were a little baby, I used to bounce you on my knee, grinning like an idiot. Shoot, I could drop you on the floor, you'd bounce right back up with a big old smile on your face. Couldn't stop you from smiling. Can't remember the last time I seen you smile. Guess I just don't have a lot to smile about lately. What about a boyfriend? Got a boyfriend? Hmm? You sound like Amber Dawn. Just saying. Girls your age, usually that's all they think about, is boys. I'm not most girls. No, you're not. You surely are not. The bishop, he is witty brain, that chooses crosses paths to pace. And ever more he pries with pain to see who seeks him most disgrace. Such stragglers when he finds astray, he takes them up and throws away. How many? 10, 12. Shit. That ain't all. You know Jersey Mike? Beat to death. You don't sell bad shit to a speed freak. What was in it? Vitamins. Vitamins? And you're sure it's none of our people? I'm positive. A dozen, you say? At least. So, what do you want? Compensation. Bill... If I start handing out compensation to every one of my customers who has a problem, when is it gonna end? Before you know it, I'll be giving product away. I've got a business to run here. Are you gonna sit here and take this happy horse shit... Shut the fuck up, Jackson. You really should keep a muzzle on your pooch here. This is fucking stupid. - What? - Huh? What'd you say? What, are you retarded? You ripped us off and we're supposed to sit here and take it up the ass? Hell, no. - Bobby! - Hey! - Sit down... - I'm warning you. I said sit down. I am. Price just went up. You come in here and insult me, accuse me of cheating. Price just went up. Frank. Look, you don't like it, go shop somewhere else. I'm tired of kissing his ass. We outnumber them ten to one. You give me the word and I'll kill him and his psycho brother. No. What do you mean "no"? I mean no. You going soft? Is it the girl? It ain't the girl. We need time. Time for what? Jackson. Fine. You think it was them? Hell, yeah, it was them. You okay? Oh... my head's pounding like a fucking drum. You know, back in the middle ages, if you disrespected the King... you got killed. Yeah, well, this ain't the middle ages. We got to get these hillbillies in line. We got to show 'em who's boss, you know? I mean, they're, they're beginning to forget, you know? We got to teach them some respect. So... you don't know anything about this? Hell no, Frank. You know... Using a little bit here and there, you know, just a taste. I got no reason to steal my own shit. You stop anywhere? See anyone? No, sir. You lying to me, girl? I can smell a liar a mile away. No, sir. She don't know nothing about this, Frank. Okay, you can go. What the hell was that, huh? I don't know. I know you, Hannah Lee Baker, and you're up to something. Don't go messing around with your Uncle Frank, all right? Promise me you're not up to something? Okay. For real? Cross my heart and hope to die. You're just like your daddy. Smart as a whip. Stubborn as a mule. The Knight is knowledge, how to fight, against his prince's enemies. He never makes his walk outright, but leaps and skips, and wily wise to take by sleight a traitorous foe, might slyly seek their overthrow. Who's stupid now, huh? Who's stupid now? Hey. Hey. Here. What's the matter? Two of my boys got killed last night. I'm really sorry. Know anything about it? Hmm? No. Frank say nothing? L-I just... deliver packages. Why... you think Uncle Frank did it? No, no, uh... His brother. Bobby? Mm-hmm. So, what are you gonna do? Nothing. Why not? 'Cause I need this. I could help you. The Rooks are reason on both sides, which keep the corner houses still. And warily stand to watch their tides, by secret art to work their will. To take some time a thief unseen, might mischief mean to King or Queen. What are you doing here? I thought you were gonna quit that stuff. I will. When? When I feel like it, I guess. When are you gonna feel like it? I don't know, Hannah. Did you come over here to lecture me? I mean, you're not my mama, you know. I know! But that stuff is gonna kill you if you don't quit. I got it under control. I mean, I... I just need a little taste for the day, you know? You're never gonna quit this stuff. You gotta make a change. A change? Look around you, Hannah, there's no change. There can be, but we have to start right now. Now... How? Bill Owens. Bill... Bill Owens? Yeah. Bill Owens? That's your plan... Bill Owens? You leave Frank and you go work for Bill. Hannah, sweetie. The only way I'm leaving Frank is in a body bag. So you're just scared of him? Fucking right I'm scared of him. You, little girl, have no idea of what the Stinsons are capable of! You have no idea of what I'm capable of. Hannah. Don't. What do you mean? That stuff is gonna kill you. Hannah. So, when am I gonna meet your Uncle Donny? Never. Why? I don't know. Get his blessing. Don't need it. He's an embarrassment. I think I'm an embarrassment to you. Well, the age thing. Stop it. It's silly. Hey. Hi. What are you watching? Uh, creepy crawlies. Creepy crawlies. That's what daddy used to call them. I miss him. Me too. I need to tell you something. I'm moving out. What? I'm moving in with someone. Who? His name is Bill. Bill Owens. Bill Owens? Yeah, you know him? Wait... is that the person that you've been seeing? Yeah, how do you know Bill? Just from around. I like Bill. Me too. There's finally something we agree on. Yeah, I guess. You know, Uncle Frank ain't gonna like that. I don't really care what he likes. Think he's up to something? Of course he's up to something. Christ. Can't Donny keep a couple of girls in line? Can't trust that useless drug addict for nothing. Okay, I'll talk to her. I'm sick of dealing with these assholes. They think they're better than us. We should just cut 'em out. We don't have the distribution chain. I'll handle the business. You fetch me Amber. It's really loud! Louder, the better. She fast? That was awesome. We'll make a biker out of you yet. Amber told me. About you and her. You cool with that? I guess. 'Cause I sure as hell am too old for you. Yeah. Does she know about our deal? No. No, the less she knows about our business, the better. So... You gonna take care of us? Yes, ma'am. Okay. Check. Hmm. Mm-mm. That's my piece, what are you doing? Mm-mm. What, then? Well, you can't win. You can force a draw, though. What if I don't want a draw? Well, it's lose or draw. Your choice. It's a sad state when you get your ass handed to you by a teenager. Yeah, you want to play again? Yeah. Rack 'em up, Bobby Fischer. Shit. So, what we talked about. Did you think about it? Yeah, I thought about it. And? And as long as Frank's alive and I'm still cooking, he ain't ever gonna let me leave, Hannah. Can I tell you something? Yeah. You know the missing drugs? Yeah, Frank's missing drugs, I heard about 'em. So... that was me, - but... - What? - If you could just listen for a second... - That was you? But I just... - If you could just listen to me. - Are you selling Frank's drugs? - Could you listen to me? - Are you crazy? - Okay, well you're clearly - What the hell - not gonna listen to me. - Are you doing, Hannah? - So I'm just gonna go. - Wait, wait... woah, woah, wait. I'm sorry. Are you going to listen? Yeah. I have a plan. All right. What? We move in with Bill until this blows over. He'll take care of us. All of us. We can be a family again. A real family. I'll try. I'll try. I'm starving. What do you got? Kitchen's closed. How about a piece of pie? Are you deaf? I said it's closed. You don't seem like you're too happy to see me. That's because every time I see you, Uncle Frank wants something. Well, he wants to see you. Now. I worked a really long day. I'm tired. Take your time. Not going. I wasn't asking. I don't take orders from you. Hey, listen. Don't get smart with me, all right? Stop! - Listen. - Stop! What do you see in that hillbilly, anyway, huh, when you could be with me? Are you crazy? Stop! Stop it, you're hurting me! Let go of me! Stop! Hello. What? Doctor, I'm-I'm- I'm Donny, her uncle. Who did this? Did she say how this happened? No, she was unconscious when she came in. When's she gonna wake up? She's under sedation right now. She just needs to get a little rest. When's she gonna be conscious? It could be three hours, it could be three days. Yeah, but you're a doctor, so you might... Donny. Okay. What happened to you? Got into a scuffle. Where's Amber? I couldn't find her. Hello? What? What? Yeah. Thanks. What's wrong? Amber was attacked. Someone beat her and left her to die in a field. Just woke up an hour ago. It looks like your appetite's coming back. Be outta here in a couple days. Oh, I almost forgot... you've got another visitor. How's the patient? She's doin' better. Good. Bet she's ready to get out of here. Can you go grab me a soda? - Sure. - Thanks. Be right back. You are so beautiful. Even all bruised up like that. You know not to tell anybody about this, right? Or I may have to go and pay a visit to Hannah. You don't want that. I got some shit I gotta do today, but... I can come back and visit later on. Would you like that? Okay. Here you go. Okay. Random. Want a soda? What's wrong? Amber, what did he say? Was this Bobby? Holy shit! Shit! Hey. What's the news? Well, she's awake. Well, that's good, huh... That's very good. Yeah, very good. What... What's up? It was Bobby. Bobby? Mm-hmm. You sure? Positive. Oh, shit. But look, he's gonna come back and he's gonna finish what he started and she is not gonna be safe, like, what... who are you calling? The cops. No, okay, see, you can't do that. Why not? Because most of them work for Uncle Frank. I can protect her. Well, then, what, huh? You seem to have it all figured out. We gotta kill them. Kill them? Yeah. You're all I got right now, and I just really you to just help me, to just do this, okay? I can't do that. Well, I thought that you loved her. Do you not care anymore? Of course I care, you know... Okay, then why don't you just kill him? - I kill... I can't... - I don't know, why, why, why? 'Cause I'm a cop. I'm an undercover cop. I am a small part... of a big operation. We are this close to bringing down the Stinsons. So let me make a call, all right? L-I can protect you. You'd be safe. You have my word. Your word? You lied to me! I'm sorry, Hannah. You're sorry? No, I'm sorry! I'm sorry that I ever trusted you! Hannah. Stay away from my sister! Hannah! What do you want? I'm kinda busy. Yeah, it's about Amber. What? What about her? I think she's getting out of the hospital in a few days. That's good. Yeah, that's great. We gotta talk. Excuse me. What? It's Bill. God damn it. Okay. - Anything else? - No. - No? - No, thanks. That's some good shit right there, huh? Tie one off, Bobby? I swear, Donny, you're like a goddamn dog. Dog, ha. That a funny one. What, you do tricks? Sit up and fetch... Beg? Or do you just lay around in bed all day, licking your balls? You know what, you're worse than a dog. Nothing but a useless drug addict junkie. You ain't gotta talk like that Bobby, we're all family here. You ain't blood. You don't get any special privileges. Jesse and your sister, they was married... Jesse ain't around no more. Maybe I'll just leave you and Frank, then. I'd like to see how far you get. I got someplace to go. You serious? I think you're being serious. I was just talking, Bobby, I was just... You hiding something? - No. - Huh? You better tell me, 'cause I'm gonna find out. She didn't mean anything by it Bobby, she didn't know! She? Ah, ow! Hold still. Hannah. I'm so sorry. It's okay. No, no, no. I told him. I told him, he's gonna be looking for you now. Let him. Okay? We're leaving. As soon as Amber gets out of the hospital, we'll be out of here, it's fine. I can't go. What do mean? What do you mean you can't? I can't leave. We're leaving! We are leaving, and if you don't come with us, then I'm done with you! Done! And when you play, beware of check. Know how to save and give a neck. And with a check, beware of mate. But chief, 'ware "had-I-wist" too late. Lose not the Queen, for ten to one... If she be lost, the game is gone. Hannah? Hannah? You in here? Hannah? Hannah. Hannah, get your ass out here! Hannah. Might-E Glue. Thousand and one uses. Is this your idea of a joke? This is for Amber. Hannah! Hannah? Hannah! You sure? Yes, sir. Absolutely sure? Yes, sir. Who did it? Don't know. Never mind. I know who did it. Go that way. Drop it! Stop! Frank? Jesus Christ, Frank, fuck, that looks real bad. We got to get you to a hospital. No hospital. You fix me here. What? Got any medical supplies? I don't know, I got a first aid kit - in the back or something. - Yeah, that'll do. Jesus Christ, Frank, I ain't a fucking doctor. Just get it. Get it, Donny. Fuck... come on. Ah. What? It's for you. Oh, God. Hey. Uncle Frank? Any medical supplies? What for? I'm hurt. Who, where? Meet me at Donny's. Come over now. Okay. Good girl. Frank? It was her all along, wasn't it? - This is a misunderstanding. - The missing drugs. Was this some kind of plot, the two of you? You want to fuck me over? Frank, what are you gonna do? I'm gonna teach that bitch a lesson. No! No, Frank. Frank, no! Frank! Come on. No, no, no! Sit down. Is it true? What? Bobby. Did you kill him? Yeah. Why? Amber? That was him. Jesus. Red phosphorous. Benzene, phosphine gas. Mix 'em together, you got a real shit storm on your hands. So, what now? Now? There's only one way it can end. Win, or draw. Your choice. Go. One spark, boom. Boom.
