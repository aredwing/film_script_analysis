YOU KNOW, THE SCREAM STARTED GETTING LOUDER AS WE GOT CLOSER AND CLOSER. THE NEXT THING I SAW WAS THIS WOMAN, AND THIS GUY WAS STOMPING ON HER HEAD. AND I GOT IN FRONT OF MY PARTNER AND JUST SHOUTED AT THE GUY. I JUST SAID, "HEY!" AND THEN HE-- HE BOLTED SO FAST. "STOP, ASSHOLE!" ( panting ) HE DUCKS INTO ANOTHER ALLEY. AND WE-- WE BACK HIM UP AGAINST THE WALL. HE TRIES TO GET PAST US. MY PARTNER SAYS, "HEY, DON'T MAKE ME TAKE YOU DOWN." AND I-- YOU KNOW, I HAD MY HANDS UP, OPEN PALMS, YOU KNOW, KIND OF LIKE A MUAY THAI STANCE. I JUST TOLD HIM, "HEY, MAN, BACK UP. DON'T-- DON'T GO NO PLACE. JUST CALM DOWN. STAY WHERE YOU'RE AT." AND HE TRIED TO GET PAST US, BUT WE JUST TRIED TO-- WE JUST BLOCKED HIM IN." ( siren wailing ) ALL OF A SUDDEN A SQUAD CAR COMES UP. SHE PUTS HIM IN HANDCUFFS, THROWS HIM IN THE BACK. AND HE ENDED UP GETTING 34 YEARS. ( tires screech ) ( sirens wailing ) ( man panting ) I DO NOT HAVE ANY SUPERPOWERS. HAVING SUPERPOWERS DOES NOT NECESSARILY MAKE YOU A SUPERHERO. I THINK IT'S HAVING SUPER MOTIVATION AND DOING SUPER DEEDS. ( grunting ) I THINK THAT'S WHAT MAKES YOU A SUPERHERO. Power Rangers Mystic Force! WELCOME TO THE XTREME CAVE. THIS IS MY RESIDENCE-- MY APARTMENT. I DO CALL IT THE XTREME CAVE, 'CAUSE IT IS WHERE I LIVE. BUT IT'S ALSO WHERE I OPERATE THE XTREME JUSTICE LEAGUE WHERE I DO MY RESEARCH AND WHERE I STORE MY EQUIPMENT. VERY MUCH INTO COMIC BOOKS. I COLLECT COMIC BOOKS. READ THEM, STARE AT THEM. THEY ARE MY INSPIRATION. OBVIOUSLY, I'M VERY MUCH INTO POWER RANGERS. YEP. YEAH, THEY'RE GONNA MORPH. YOU CAN GO OVER SOME OF MY BOOK COLLECTION-- "CHEAP SHOTS, AMBUSHES AND OTHER LESSONS," "ONE-STRIKE STOPPING POWER," "CALIFORNIA PENAL CODE," "THE CRIMINAL LAW HANDBOOK," "WORLD'S DEADLIEST FIGHTING SECRETS," "THE BRUTAL ART OF RIPPING, POKING AND PRESSING VITAL TARGETS." THIS IS A "BOB," OR BODY OPPONENT BAG. IT'S USED BY A LOT OF DIFFERENT MARTIAL ARTISTS, MARTIAL ARTS SCHOOLS. START OFF WITH A PALM STRIKE TO THE NOSE, FOLLOW IT UP BY EYE GOUGE, AND THEN PUT IN AN ELBOW TECHNIQUE TO HIS TEMPLE, ANOTHER ELBOW TECHNIQUE AND THEN COME IN HERE AND THEN BOOM. I CAN EVEN DEMONSTRATE SOME OF MY TECHNIQUES FROM MY SUPER EXTREME DEATH METAL FIGHTING SYSTEM. AW, MAN. HE'S GOT MY ARMS. MAYBE HE'S PUNCHING ME. HE'S FUCKING HEAD-BUTTING ME. I GOTTA TRY TO PROTECT MY FACE. AND THEN BOOM-- I CAN TRY TO REACH FOR HIS EYES AND JUST SCOOP THEM OUT WITH MY THUMB, AND THEN MAYBE THE OTHER ONE. AND-- AND THEN MAYBE I CAN JUST-- JUST GRAB LIKE-- JUST PRETTY MUCH DIG MY THUMBS INTO HIS EYES. AND I CAN JUST COME IN WITH, YOU KNOW, A BITE. ( exhaling ) ( grunting ) BITCH SLAP HIS ASS. FUCKING BITCH. I'VE GROWN UP IN A HOUSEHOLD OF ABUSE, VIOLENCE. I WAS BULLIED IN SCHOOL. I MYSELF HAVE BEEN A VICTIM OF VIOLENT CRIME AND I'VE WITNESSED ALL THE APATHY AND ALL THE INDIFFERENCE. PEOPLE ARE JUST ALL INTO THEMSELVES. AND I SEE ALL THIS SHALLOWNESS GOING AROUND. I DO THIS TO PROTEST THE THINGS THAT ARE JUST WRONG WITH SOCIETY. Stan Lee: IT JUST OCCURS TO ME, IT'S HARD TO CONCEIVE OF HER RUNNING FAST IN HIGH HEELS, AND YET I LIKE THE IDEA THAT-- 'CAUSE THEY MAKE THE GIRLS' LEGS LOOK BETTER IF THEY-- IF YOU-- YOU'RE ON HIGH HEELS. WHAT IF SHE-- WOULD IT LOOK TOO UNGAINLY IF SHE WORE WEDGIES? YOU KNOW WHAT WEDGIES ARE? WHEN I FIRST MOVED OUT HERE, THERE WAS A FELLOW WHO CALLED HIMSELF CAPTAIN STICKY. IF HE FELT THERE WAS A SLUM DWELLING SOMEWHERE IN THE INNER CITY, AND THE LANDLORD WASN'T GIVING THE TENANTS HOT WATER, HE'D PARK HIS LINCOLN CONTINENTAL IN FRONT OF THE BUILDING AND WITH A LOUDSPEAKER HE WOULD DENOUNCE THE LANDLORD AND MAKE SUCH A FUSS THAT EVENTUALLY OUT OF EMBARRASSMENT THE LANDLORD WOULD TURN ON THE HOT WATER OR DO WHATEVER HE DID. AND HE RAN AROUND IN THIS COSTUME WITH THE CLOAK. HE WAS A VERY FUNNY GUY. AND HE TOOK HIMSELF VERY SERIOUSLY. YOU COULD HAVE A SUPERHERO WHO'S VERY SHY. YOU COULD HAVE A SUPERHERO WHO'S VERY FORWARD-GOING AND CONCEITED. AND YOU COULD HAVE A SUPERHERO WHO'S NOT TOO BRIGHT OR ONE WHO'S BRILLIANT. SUPERHEROES COME IN ALL SIZES, SHAPES AND TYPES. BUT I'D BE A LITTLE BIT WORRIED ABOUT SOMEBODY WITH NO ACTUAL SUPERPOWER WHO PUTS ON A COSTUME AND THEN RUNS AROUND CHALLENGING CRIMINALS OR PEOPLE WHO MIGHT BE ARMED. I FIGURE THAT PERSON COULD GET HURT. MY NAME IS ZIMMER. I AM FROM AUSTIN, TEXAS. AND I'M NOW IN BROOKLYN, NEW YORK. WHAT'S AMAZING ABOUT THE REAL-LIFE SUPERHERO EXPERIENCE IS THAT YOU CAN TAKE EVERYTHING THAT'S IMPORTANT TO YOU AND EVERYTHING THAT YOU ENJOY DOING AND INCORPORATE IT INTO YOUR PERSONA AND YOUR MISSIONS. I CARE ABOUT HUMANITY. I CARE ABOUT THE FACT THAT WE'RE TRASHING THE PLANET. I CARE ABOUT THE FACT THAT MOST GOVERNMENTS ARE VERY CORRUPT. I CARE THAT THE POLICE ARE CORRUPT. THE ONLY WAY THE FABRIC OF HUMANITY IS GOING TO CHANGE AND THE ONLY WAY THESE PROBLEMS ARE GOING TO BE ADDRESSED IS IF SOMEONE ADDRESSES THEM. THANK YOU. I CAME TO BROOKLYN FOR A LOT OF REASONS. THERE WERE A LOT OF PEOPLE ONLINE-- THERE WAS A LOT OF BUZZ ABOUT NEW YORK AND BROOKLYN AND WHAT COULD BE DONE IN A CITY IF THERE WERE MULTIPLE SUPERHEROES IN IT. MY ROOMMATES ARE SUPERHEROES. I'M CURRENTLY LIVING WITH Z. HE'S FROM DETROIT. THERE'S T.S.A.F.-- SHE'S FROM DETROIT AS WELL-- AND LUCID, WHO'S REALLY FROM ALL OVER. THIS IS ME ACTING OUT A NEED I FEEL. I FEEL SOMETHING NEEDS TO BE DONE, WHATEVER IT MAY BE. I'M JUST SICK OF THE CORRUPTION THAT I SEE EVERYWHERE I LOOK, YOU KNOW, WHETHER IT IS THE BOSS AT YOUR WORK OR THE DUDE, YOU KNOW, NEXT DOOR THAT'S BEATING HIS WIFE AND BEEN DOING SO FOR 20 YEARS. YOU KNOW, IT'S ALL THE LITTLE THINGS. AND WE MOVED TO BROOKLYN BECAUSE WE FIGURED IT'S A LARGE ENOUGH AREA WHERE WE CAN HAVE MUCH MORE TO ACTUALLY FOCUS ON. N.Y.P.D., EVEN THE GOVERNMENT ITSELF, IS COMPLETELY UNRELIABLE. YOU KNOW, I'M HERE TO DO SOMETHING, DO ANYTHING. I'VE ALWAYS GOTTEN ALONG WITH Z THE MOST BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, MUCH LIKE ME, HE IS SOMEONE WHO HAS HAD A FUCKED-UP LIFE. Z: THERE WAS A LOT OF THINGS GOING ON IN MY LIFE. AND I SAW MYSELF GOING DOWN A REALLY BAD PATH. AND I KIND OF LOST HOPE. SO, UM, I TRIED TO-- I TRIED TO OFF MYSELF, YOU KNOW? AND WHEN I WOKE UP, IT DIDN'T WORK. AND I REALLY WOKE UP, YOU KNOW? LIKE I DIDN'T JUST WAKE UP. I WOKE UP AND REALIZED THAT THAT WOULD BE KIND OF A WASTE, YOU KNOW? BECAUSE I GOT A LOT OF THINGS THAT I CAN DO AND THAT I OFFER. T.S.A.F.: WE'RE INDIVIDUALS, MEANING PEOPLE THAT HAVE VARIED BACKGROUNDS. AND WE'RE ALL COMING TOGETHER FOR ONE PURPOSE, AND THAT'S TO HELP. T.S.A.F.-- TSAF. IT STANDS FOR "THE SILENCED AND FORGOTTEN." REALLY THE ONLY THING THAT I COULD THINK OF WAS TO HAVE IT BE A REMINDER OF WHY I'M DOING THIS IN THE FIRST PLACE, SO THAT I JUST KNOW THAT IT'S NEVER ABOUT ME. "THE NEW YORK INITIATIVE"-- IT'S A CALL TO PERSONAL ACCOUNTABILITY FOR OURSELVES AND FOR EVERYBODY ELSE. Zimmer: MY FIRST NIGHT ON PATROL, FOR REAL, WAS THE ANNIVERSARY OF KITTY GENOVESE'S DEATH. Mr. Xtreme: MARCH 13th, 1964, IN NEW YORK CITY IN QUEENS, A WOMAN NAMED KATHERINE GENOVESE, A.K.A KITTY GENOVESE-- SHE WAS ASSAULTED, BRUTALLY ATTACKED, RAPED AND ULTIMATELY MURDERED. AND 38 PEOPLE FROM A NEARBY APARTMENT COMPLEX-- THEY HEARD IT. THEY HEARD HER SCREAM. SOME SAW IT, BUT THEY DIDN'T DO ANYTHING. Zimmer: IT WAS A WORLDWIDE STORY THAT PEOPLE WERE THIS APATHETIC. AND SO ON THE ANNIVERSARY OF HER DEATH-- AND I WAS IN A RELATIONSHIP AT THE TIME AND LIVING WITH THE PERSON. SO I SNUCK OUT OF BED. I GOT ON MY GEAR AND WENT OUT. IT WAS A VERY PERSONAL EXPERIENCE TO ME, 'CAUSE I REALLY THOUGHT ABOUT WHAT I WANTED TO DO WITH MY LIFE AND WHAT WAS IMPORTANT TO ME. AND I THINK THAT'S WHAT CEMENTED MY COMMITMENT TO THE REAL-LIFE SUPERHERO MOVEMENT AND THE CAUSES THAT THEY UPHOLD. News announcer: "THE VILLAGE VOICE" IS RELEASING SOME SHOCKING RECORDINGS MADE INSIDE A BROOKLYN POLICE PRECINCT. "THE VOICE" SAYS THE TAPES SHOW PRECINCT BOSSES PRESSURING COPS TO MAKE THEIR MONTHLY QUOTAS OF ARRESTS AND STOP-AND-FRISKS AND URGING OFFICERS TO RECORD FEWER ACTUAL CRIMES IN ORDER TO MANIPULATE CRIME STATISTICS. Lucid: ALL RIGHT, SO WE'VE BEEN LOOKING AT "THE VILLAGE VOICE" LATELY, RIGHT? THE N.Y.P.D. HAS BEEN PRETTY MUCH CAUGHT RED-HANDED BY ONE OF THEIR OWN. AND WE NEED TO TALK ABOUT IT, BECAUSE I THINK IT'S-- THEY HAVE NO MANPOWER. THEY WRITE A BUNCH OF TICKETS FOR NOTHING AND THEY SHOW ALL THIS ACTIVITY, BUT THEY DON'T FOCUS ON ANY MAJOR CRIMES. THEY DON'T FOCUS ON ROBBERIES, FELONIES. THEY JUST DON'T HAVE THE MANPOWER FOR THAT. THIS QUOTE IS JUST RIDICULOUS: "A TYPICAL DAY AT THE PRECINCT HAD ONLY THREE TO NINE OFFICERS PATROLLING THE STREETS IN AN AREA OF MORE THAN THEY ARE ESSENTIALLY-- I MEAN, THREE TO NINE PEOPLE? WE'RE THREE TO NINE PEOPLE. RIGHT NOW THERE'S NO ONE IN THIS PRECINCT THAT'S OUT TO FIGHT CRIME. THEY'RE OUT TO FILL QUOTAS. - Lucid: YEAH. - THERE'S NO ONE FIGHTING CRIME RIGHT NOW. THERE NEEDS TO BE PEOPLE THAT KNOW WHAT THEY'RE DOING IN THE POLICE DEPARTMENTS. AND IF THEY CAN'T, THEN THEY NEED OUTSIDE HELP. Lieutenant Andra Brown: I'VE BEEN WITH THE POLICE DEPARTMENT FOR 24 YEARS. I SPENT MY FIRST 21 YEARS IN UNIFORM OUT IN THE FIELD. I LOVE MY CAREER IN LAW ENFORCEMENT. I RECOMMEND IT. WHEN THE AVERAGE CITIZEN ATTEMPTS TO TAKE THE LAW INTO THEIR OWN HANDS, THEY'RE DOING IT FOR MAYBE NOBLE REASONS, BUT BECAUSE THEY'RE IMPASSIONED BY SOMETHING, AND PERHAPS THAT THEY'RE NOT USING THE MOST CLEAR JUDGMENT OR THE MOST COMMON SENSE. AND ANYTIME ANYONE ACTS WITHOUT COMMON SENSE OR WITHOUT GOOD JUDGMENT, GOOD THINGS RARELY HAPPEN. I TOLD YOU MY BOMBS AREN'T NO FUNNY BUSINESS. ( laughs ) I BECAME A REAL-LIFE SUPERHERO AT A VERY YOUNG AGE-- SOME PEOPLE WILL LAUGH AT THIS-- EIGHT OR NINE YEARS OLD WHEN I HAD TO FIGHT A BULLY IN SCHOOL. HE WAS BEATING UP ON PEOPLE, POURING MILK ON THEIR HEAD. AND HE GOT AWAY WITH EVERYTHING JUST BECAUSE HIS MAMA WORKED IN THE OFFICE. SHE WAS LIKE ASSISTANT PRINCIPAL OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT. WELL, I GOT SICK OF IT. FROM MY INFLUENCE OF COMIC BOOKS, I BUILT MYSELF A MASK WITH SHOESTRINGS AND AN OLD PIECE OF MATERIAL, MADE MYSELF A SHIRT WITH AN EMBLEM ON IT, AND THEN I JUMPED OUT ONE DAY AND BEAT UP THE BULLY, AND RAN AWAY AND HURRIED UP AND TUCKED AWAY MY SUIT. THEY NEVER KNEW WHO DID IT. THAT'S WHEN MASTER LEGEND WAS BORN. HI THERE, SIRS. I GUESS YOU CAN SAY GOD GAVE ME THE CALLING. HE TOLD ME, "I GAVE YOU POWERS. I GAVE YOU STRENGTH BEYOND THAT-- THAT MOST PEOPLE WILL EVER HAVE. YOU HAVE TO GET OUT THERE AND SHOW PEOPLE THE TRUTH." AND THAT'S WHAT I'M DOING. MAN, YOU'RE IN A LOT OF PAIN, HUH? HE DOESN'T DESERVE TO HAVE THIS PAIN. HE DOESN'T DESERVE TO HAVE TO SUFFER 'CAUSE SOME DRUNK DRIVER OR WHATEVER RAN HIM OVER. IT'S MISERY. SO I ASK YOU, GOD-- AND I KNOW GOD ALWAYS LISTENS TO ME. SO HE'S GOING TO HELP YOU OUT, MAN. MASTER LEGEND IS ONE OF THOSE PEOPLE THAT, WHEN YOU MEET HIM, HE JUST HAS AWESOME WRITTEN ALL OVER HIM. HE IS ONE OF THE MOST CHARISMATIC PEOPLE I'VE SEEN ABOUT HELPING OTHERS IN MY ENTIRE LIFE. HEY, PRETTY LADIES. WHOA, I TELL YA, THEY DON'T MAKE THEM BETTER THAN THAT. ( laughs ) I STARTED TEAM JUSTICE YEARS AGO. WE'RE THE ONLY SUPERHERO TEAM THAT HAS A NON-PROFIT ORGANIZATION STATUS RECOGNIZED BY THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT. LUCKILY, FINDING THE CHOICE PEOPLE THAT I HAVE, LIKE SUPER HERO AND SYMBIOTE-- THEY HAVE TAKEN IT TO WHERE I NEEDED THEM TO GO TO BE ABLE TO-- HEY THERE. IS IT REALLY YOU? YEAH, MASTER LEGEND. - SERIOUSLY? - YEAH. - Woman #2: SERIOUSLY? - OH MY GOD. - I'VE BEEN DYING TO MEET YOU. - ME TOO. - WOW, WHAT IS YOUR NAME? - MY NAME'S STEPHANIE. STEPHANIE. BEAUTIFUL STEPHANIE. - BRANDIE. - BRANDIE. - VERY NICE TO MEET YOU. - BEAUTIFUL BEAUTIFUL BRANDIE. - UM, UM... - IS THIS ARMOR TOO? OH NO. I'M SORRY. IT'S NOT. WELL, IT CAN GET STIFF NOW. ( laughs ) MASTER LEGEND IS VERY PSYCHIC. I'LL JUST GO AHEAD AND SAY IT. I HAVE SUPER SPEED, HIGH ENDURANCE, SIGHT BEYOND SIGHT, HEALING POWERS, SUPERHUMAN STRENGTH. HE'S NEVER BEEN WRONG ABOUT ANYTHING HE'S EVER PREDICTED. A FEW YEARS AGO THERE WAS A BOY WHO I THOUGHT WAS MY SON, BELIEVE IT OR NOT, A 19-YEAR-OLD SON FROM UP NORTH OF HERE. AND MASTER LEGEND KNEW BEFORE ANYBODY ELSE DID, "NOPE, HE'S NOT YOUR SON." SURE ENOUGH, THAT TURNED OUT TO BE RIGHT. WE'RE GOING TO GO ONWARD TO THE JUSTICE VAN. ( car horn honks ) ( laughs ) HOW I LOVE JUMPING IN FRONT OF CARS, HUH? THE JUSTICE VAN IS EQUIPPED WITH JUST ABOUT EVERY TYPE OF LIFESAVING THING THAT I CAN POSSIBLY HAVE ON HAND. I'VE GOT SOME DONATIONS IN THERE. I'VE GOT AN AIR CONDITION HERE THAT I'M GONNA BE HELPING OUT THESE PEOPLE WITH THAT DON'T HAVE AN AIR CONDITION. AND OF COURSE I'VE GOT THE ICE CHEST THERE. AND I'VE GOT THESE THAT I BRING, YOU KNOW, IN CASE I RUN INTO SOME KIDS AND STUFF LIKE THAT. BUT Y'ALL CAN HAVE SOME OF THESE TOO. YOU KNOW, THEY'RE FLAVORFUL TREATS. ( laughs ) BUT OH WELL, YOU KNOW. BUT THEN THERE'S ONE THING MASTER LEGEND HAS TO HAVE, BECAUSE HE WORKS UP A WHOPPING THIRST RUNNING AROUND LIKE THIS. AND THERE YOU GO. THAT'S WHAT I HAVE-- A GOOD COLD BEER. YOU KNOW, AND THERE'S NOTHING WRONG WITH IT. THERE'S NOTHING WRONG WITH A GOOD COLD BEER USED IN MODERATION, OF COURSE. NEVER DRINK TO DRUNKENNESS. AH. WHEN A MAN WORKS UP A WHOPPING THIRST, THAT'S WHAT QUENCHES IT, NOT SOME KOOL-AID. A SERIAL GROPER MAY BE WALKING THE STREETS OF CHULA VISTA GRABBING GIRLS AND WOMEN AND SEXUALLY ASSAULTING THEM. THIS IS A SKETCH OF THE MAN RESPONSIBLE FOR GROPING AT LEAST 13 WOMEN AND GIRLS IN THE CHULA VISTA AREA IN THE LAST FOUR MONTHS. Mr. Xtreme: HERE'S ONE OF MY XTREME JUSTICE LEAGUE FLYERS. AS YOU CAN SEE, I LIKE TO DO IT WITH WORDS A LITTLE BIT MORE CRUDE, MORE RAW. THE IDEA IS SO IT CAN GRAB SOMEONE'S ATTENTION. THEY MIGHT SAY, "WELL, THIS LOOKS LIKE SHIT. LET ME TAKE A LOOK. WELL, WHAT'S ALL THIS?" AND THEN THEY READ IT, AND THEY REALIZE, "OH WOW. THERE'S A MISSING PERSON. THERE'S A SEXUAL PREDATOR ON THE LOOSE." 'CAUSE IT JUST STANDS OUT MORE. CHULA VISTA GROPER-- HE STARTED ATTACKING LAST YEAR. IN ONE INSTANCE HE BIT ONE OF THE VICTIMS ON HER BUTTOCKS. I HOPE TO GET HIS FACE OUT MORE INTO THE PUBLIC SO PEOPLE WILL BE AWARE THAT THIS GUY'S OUT THERE. ONE OF THE ATTACKS HAPPENED AROUND THE S.D.S.U.-- SAN DIEGO STATE AREA. IT'S NOT CONFIRMED, BUT THE M.O. WAS VERY SIMILAR. THERE WAS A SEXUAL ASSAULT THERE THAT HAPPENED LAST NIGHT, SO I FEEL THAT IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE STEP UP PATROLS OVER IN THAT AREA. ( women laughing, chattering ) Woman: CAN I TAKE A PICTURE OF YOU SO I CAN MAKE SURE THIS IS REAL? - Mr. Xtreme: THERE WAS A CRIME THAT HAPPENED. - Woman: OH MY GOD. YEAH, OUT HERE JUST TRYING TO KEEP PEOPLE SAFE. THERE WAS A SEXUAL ASSAUL HERE LAST NIGHT. THAT'S AWESOME. CAN I SEE YOUR EYES? ACTUALLY I HAVE TO KEEP MY EYES CONCEALED. I CAN'T SEE YOUR EYES? THAT'S WEIRD. OH, SO THAT SO NO ONE KNOWS WHO YOU ARE? Man: THE SUPERMAN. THIS IS CLARK KENT. OKAY, YOU GUYS BE SAFE OUT THERE WALKING. Women: THANK YOU. BYE. ( women giggle ) OKAY, ANYWAYS, RIGHT NOW THE POLICE ARE PRETTY MUCH WATCHING ME WITH A MICROSCOPE. ARE YOU OUT HERE BY YOURSELF TONIGHT? YEAH, IT'S JUST GONNA BE ME. I'LL BE OUT HERE TILL ABOUT 2:00-- ABOUT 2:00, YEAH. OKAY, YOU'RE STILL CARRYING THE TASER, RIGHT? YEAH, I HAVE A TASER AND I HAVE A STUN GUN. OKAY, JUST TO LET YOU KNOW, MAN, - JUST DON'T GO ANYWHERE ON CAMPUS, DUDE, WITH THAT. - ON CAMPUS, OKAY. BECAUSE IF YOU GO ON CAMPUS WITH THE STUN GUN, IT'S BAD NEWS. - YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING? - OKAY, YEAH, I UNDERSTAND. YOU CAN'T GO ON CAMPUS WITH ANYTHING SORT OF LESS LETHAL-- YOU KNOW, YOU CAN'T GO ON THERE WITH PEPPER SPRAY AND TASERS AND STUFF LIKE THAT. - OH, STUDENTS CAN'T EVEN CARRY PEPPER SPRAY ON CAMPUS? - NO. - AW, MAN. - THAT'S WHAT WE'RE HERE FOR, YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING? - YEAH YEAH YEAH. - IF YOU HAVE A PROBLEM, YOU CALL THE POLICE. - SO JUST GIVING YOU A HEADS-UP. - YEAH, NO PROBLEM, NO PROBLEM. - YEAH, OKAY. - ALL RIGHT? Police officer: YEAH, I DON'T KNOW, MAN. I MEAN, I THINK IT'S A GOOD THING, AS LONG AS HE STAYS SAFE. IF HE GETS INTO ANY PROBLEMS, YOU KNOW, HE'S GOT TO CALL THE POLICE, 'CAUSE HE'S GOT TASERS AND STUFF, BUT SOMETIMES PEOPLE CARRY GUNS AND KNIVES AND STUFF, SO... Mr. Xtreme: WHAT THE OFFICER TOLD ME-- I WAS ASKING HIM ABOUT THE SEXUAL ASSAULT THAT TOOK PLACE LAST NIGHT. HE STATED THAT IT WAS ACTUALLY ALONG-- Man: HEY, GET THE FUCK OFF OUR PROPERTY RIGHT NOW. I WILL CALL THE POLICE. GET THE FUCK OFF OUR PROPERTY. THANKS FOR SAYING "PLEASE." HERE YOU GO, SIR. I'VE GOT SOME INFORMATION ABOUT THE XTREME JUSTICE LEAGUE. THANK YOU. CAN I GIVE YOU GUYS A COUPLE OF FLYERS ABOUT THE XTREME JUSTICE LEAGUE? YEAH, CHECK IT OUT. ALL RIGHT? - THANK YOU. - SURE. CURRENTLY I AM THE ONLY MEMBER OF THE XTREME JUSTICE LEAGUE. BUT RIGHT NOW WE ARE RECRUITING. YEAH, CHECK US OUT. WE'RE RECRUITING RIGHT NOW. WE'RE RECRUITING SUPERHEROES THAT WANT TO GO OUT AND FIGHT CRIME. - WHAT DO YOU GUYS DO? - WE PATROL THE STREETS. I TRY TO SAFEGUARD NEIGHBORHOODS, PREVENT VIOLENT CRIME AND TRY TO RAISE AWARENESS ABOUT VIOLENT CRIME IN THE COMMUNITY. XTREME JUSTICE LEAGUE. - EXTREME? - JUSTICE LEAGUE. XTREME JUSTICE LEAGUE. - EXTREME? - YES. DEFINITELY WE'RE LOOKING FOR PEOPLE FOR THE XTREME JUSTICE LEAGUE TO JOIN UP AND HELP OU WITH OUR CRIME-FIGHTING EFFORTS. HOW'D YOU GET THIS VEST? IS IT BULLETPROOF? - Man: X.J.L.? - X.J.L., YES. - THAT'S MY ORGANIZATION. - OH COOL, OKAY. HAVE YOU BEEN SHOT, DUDE? NO, ACTUALLY. I HOPE THAT DAY NEVER COMES. YEAH, ME TOO. I REALLY DON'T. THAT WOULD BE PRETTY-- PRETTY HAIRY. BUT, YOU KNOW, IN THIS LINE OF WORK THAT COULD HAPPEN. - WHAT'S YOUR NAME? - MR. XTREME. MR. XTREME. OKAY. I REALLY DON'T HAVE A SOCIAL LIFE, TO BE HONEST. YOU KNOW, I DON'T HAVE THE TIME. BEING A SUPERHERO, IT CAN BE A PRETTY LONELY-- A LONELY PATH. WELL, AT LEAST FOR ME IT IS. YOU KNOW, I CAN'T SPEAK FOR EVERYBODY ELSE. REAL-LIFE SUPERHEROES AREN'T NECESSARILY ANY CRAZIER THAN YOU OR I OR ANYONE ELSE. THEY TAKE THE STANCE OF IF SUPERHEROES WERE REAL, WHAT WOULD IT BE LIKE? - WHAT THE FUCK IS THAT? - A REAL-LIFE SUPERHERO. I'M WHAT'S CALLED A REAL-LIFE SUPERHERO. - THE NAME'S AMAZONIA. - OKAY. THEY ARE DEDICATED TO WHAT THEY DO. I AM THE CONUNDRUM. I AM A BLACK BELT IN BRAZILIAN JU-JITSU, WITH SIX-YEAR PERIODS OF FREE-RUNNING, PARKOUR AND GYMNASTICS. IT'S A HOBBY FOR MOST PEOPLE, BECAUSE IT'S NOT A PAYING JOB. AND IT'S A HOBBY THAT THEY'VE THROWN THEMSELVES INTO PASSIONATELY. ( engine starts ) A CAR HAS ITS ADVANTAGES. A CAR IMPRESSES PEOPLE. A CAR MAKES THEM KNOW YOU'RE LEGIT. MY STATUS POINTS WENT WAY UP WHEN I HAD THE SUPERMOBILE. LIKE YOU PULL UP INTO A GAS STATION, AND PEOPLE ARE LIKE, "DAMN. THIS GUY IS A SUPERHERO." AND THEY ARE ALSO DOING GOOD AT THE SAME TIME. Life: WELL, THE WORLD IS OUT OF BALANCE. I AND MANY MANY GOOD PEOPLE IN THE WORLD ARE TRYING TO WORK TO PERFECT THAT BALANCE. MY NAME IS CHAIM. - CHAIM IS HEBREW, AND IT MEANS "LIFE." - HOW ARE YOU DOING? AND WHEN I BECAME A SUPERHERO, IT REALLY SEEMED OBVIOUS FOR ME TO GO WITH "LIFE." WITHOUT LIFE THERE IS NOTHING. Thanatos: I WAS TOLD BY A POLICE OFFICER THAT PEOPLE ON THE STREET HAD NOTHING BETTER TO LOOK FORWARD TO THAN DEATH. I DECIDED IF THAT WAS THE CASE, THEN MAYBE DEATH HAD BETTER STEP IN HIMSELF. I'VE SORT OF BECOME A PARODY OF DEATH, BECAUSE RATHER THAN TAKING LIFE, I'M GIVING IT. A REAL-LIFE SUPERHERO IS AN ICON TO INSPIRE PEOPLE THAT EVERYBODY CAN MAKE A DIFFERENCE. WE ALL HAVE ALTER EGOS. WE DON'T ALL DRESS IN COSTUME. Apocalypse Meow: I WAS SITTING ON THE COUCH ONE DAY AND HE TOLD ME THAT HE WANTED TO SHOW ME SOMETHING. AND HE LEFT THE HOUSE. AND WHEN HE CAME BACK IN, HE WAS ALL DRESSED FROM HEAD TO TOE IN HIS LEATHER PANTS AND HIS GREAT BIG "Z." AND I WAS VERY CONFUSED. AND I DIDN'T LIKE IT ONE BIT. I KEPT TELLING HIM, "YOU'RE DONE. HOPE YOU HAD A GOOD TIME. YOU'RE SO DONE WITH THIS." ( laughs ) AND HE TOLD ME, "I'M NOT QUITTING." I TOLD HIM, "WELL, IF YOU'RE NOT GONNA QUIT, THEN WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO COMPROMISE. I'M GONNA HAVE TO GO WITH YOU." AND HE SAID, "OKAY." AND THAT'S HOW I GOT STARTED. Mr. Xtreme: ANY DAY JOB I'VE EVER HAD, I'VE NEVER LIKED. BUT I HAVE TO PAY THE BILLS JUST LIKE EVERYBODY ELSE. WHEN I'M NOT DOING THIS, I'M A TEACHER. I'M A STAY-AT-HOME DAD. I HAVE TWO KIDS. THERE'S FOUR OF US THAT ARE TATTOO ARTISTS AND ALSO SUPERHEROES. MY CURRENT DAY JOB IS A SECURITY GUARD. I HAVE A LOT OF TRAINING. I'M A MARTIAL ARTS INSTRUCTOR. THE INGREDIENTS TO BE A REAL-LIFE SUPERHERO REALLY VARY, 'CAUSE EVERYBODY'S LOOKING TO DO SOMETHING DIFFERENT. BUT IF YOU'RE LOOKING TO BE, YOU KNOW, A CRIME FIGHTER OR YOU'RE LOOKING TO REALLY DO PATROLS, I THINK YOU HAVE TO BE IN SHAPE. I THINK YOU NEED MARTIAL ARTS TRAINING. YOU CAN'T JUST THROW ON A MASK AND GO OUT AND THINK YOU'RE GONNA DO SOMETHING. YOU'RE GONNA GET YOURSELF KILLED. I TRY TO KEEP MYSELF IN GOOD SHAPE, AND, YOU KNOW, JUST KEEP MYSELF SAFE IF I'M GOING TO BE ON THE STREETS. I'VE BEEN OUT THERE QUITE A FEW TIMES, GOING UP AGAINST THE DEALERS IN WASHINGTON SQUARE PARK. THERE'S TIMES WHERE THEY WOULD GET IN MY FACE AND THREATEN ME. YOU KNOW, THERE'S A TIME A GUY FLASHED A GUN AT US. BUT THE THING IS I'VE NEVER BACKED DOWN AND THE PEOPLE I WORK WITH HAVE NEVER BACKED DOWN. AND WE'VE ALWAYS MANAGED TO BE ON TOP OF THAT. SO THEY WERE DEFINITELY SELLING. The Cameraman: I STARTED OFF JUST KIND OF FILMING THE MOVEMENT, 'CAUSE THERE WAS JUST SOMETHING ABOUT THE TOPIC THAT DREW ME TO IT. BUT EVENTUALLY I GOT SUCKED INTO THE WORLD. AND, YOU KNOW, BEFORE I KNEW IT, I FOUND MYSELF GOING ON CRIME-FIGHTING PATROLS WITH DARK GUARDIAN AS THE CAMERAMAN, SHOOTING HIS PATROLS. Dark Guardian: THERE WAS ACTUALLY A TIME WHERE A WHOLE BIG GROUP OF US WENT OUT. IT WAS A BIG BUSINESS DAY FOR THE DEALERS. WE WENT OUT THERE TO KICK THEM OUT. WE'RE HERE 'CAUSE WE'RE NOT GONNA TOLERATE DRUGS IN THE PARK ANYMORE. WE'RE NOT GOING TO STAND FOR IT. IT GOES ON AND ON AND ON AND NOBODY DOES NOTHING OR SAYS ANYTHING. IT'S TIME SOMEBODY STOOD UP. Dark Guardian: THEY DIDN'T WANT TO LEAVE. BUT WE DIDN'T BACK DOWN AND WE RUINED THEIR NIGHT OF BUSINESS. IF YOU'RE SELLING ANYTHING, YOU KNOW YOU AIN'T GONNA BE SELLING NOTHING RIGHT NOW. SO NOBODY'S GONNA BE COMING OVER HERE. I'M LETTING Y'ALL KNOW THAT. IT'S GONNA BE A BAD NIGHT OF SELLING. Dark Guardian: THE CAMERAMAN HAS BEEN AN ESSENTIAL PART OF WORKING THE PARKS. I USUALLY SEND HIM IN TO GET AUDIO OF THE DEALERS, SO I KNOW EXACTLY WHO'S SELLING, HAVE SOME EVIDENCE OF WHAT'S GOING ON. HE'S GOT A GIANT PAIR OF BALLS, BECAUSE HE'S RIGHT THERE WITH ME HOLDING THAT CAMERA. FIRST OF ALL, THERE'S POLICE RIGHT THERE. Dark Guardian: THE POLICE-- THEY'VE ACTUALLY PICKED ME UP BEFORE. WHO ARE YOU? WHAT'S YOUR NAME? I'M DARK GUARDIAN. ( laughs ) OKAY. THEY WERE ALL JUST, "HEY, WE APPRECIATE YOU TRYING TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE, BUT WE DON'T WANT TO SEE YOU GET HURT." Lieutenant Brown: REAL-LIFE SUPERHEROES-- THEY'RE NOT TRAINED. THEY DON'T HAVE THE TACTICS AND THE EQUIPMENT. THEY DON'T HAVE THE KNOWLEDGE OF LAW, OR CASE LAW. THEY DON'T HAVE PROTOCOLS AND PROCEDURES, GUIDELINES, THE WAY THAT THE POLICE OFFICERS DO TO ENSURE THAT PEOPLE'S CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS ARE PROTECTED. I CONSIDER MYSELF TO BE A PROTECTOR. AND I WORK WITHIN THE LAWS. I WORK WITHIN THE SYSTEMS. I DON'T GO OUT THERE AND TRY TO HARASS PEOPLE. I DON'T GO OUT THERE TO TRY TO VIOLATE THEIR CIVIL RIGHTS. I DON'T ACT AS THE JUDGE, JURY AND EXECUTIONER. MY MAIN FOCUS IS TO RAISE AWARENESS, TO BE OUT THERE, TO BE A VISUAL DETERRENT TO PREVENT VIOLENT CRIME. EVERY DAY WHEN I PUT ON MY GEAR AND I BECOME MR. XTREME, I'M VERY AFRAID WHEN I GO OUT THERE ON PATROL. THE SHIFT THAT I MIGHT BE WORKING-- IT COULD VERY WELL BE MY LAST SHIFT. I MEAN, ANY OF US CAN BE SHOT, STABBED, RAT PACKED, RUN OVER AND SO FORTH. LATELY I'VE BEEN TEAMING UP WITH VIGILANTE SPIDER. MY NAME IS THE VIGILANTE SPIDER. I STARTED OUT IN LAS VEGAS, NEVADA. I NOW PATROL MOST OF NORTH COUNTY. JUST LIKE ANY OTHER DAY, YOU WALK DOWNSTAIRS, YOU HAVE BREAKFAST, YOU SAY HELLO TO YOUR GIRLFRIEND, YOU GO TO WORK, YOU SAY HI TO YOUR FRIENDS AT WORK. AND THEN YOU GO HOME AFTER ALL THE MONOTONY IS DONE, AND YOU SLEEP. ( laughs ) Man: SO YOU HAVE A GIRLFRIEND? EH, I WAS JUST METAPHORICALLY SPEAKING. YOU KNOW, IF REGULAR PEOPLE CAN DO THIS, WHY CAN'T I? PEOPLE LIKE BATMAN. HE DOESN'T HAVE ANY POWERS, YET HE'S PART OF THE JUSTICE LEAGUE. SO I THOUGHT TO MYSELF, "HEY, WELL, I'LL JUST GO DRESS UP AND STALK AROUND MY CITY AND SEE WHAT GOES ON." AND I'VE BEEN DOING THAT FOR ABOUT A DECADE NOW. ( siren whoops ) NOW WE HAVE P.D. ROLLING UP ON US, SO... - SO YOU ALREADY TALKED TO ALL MY PARTNERS, RIGHT? - YEAH YEAH. - HE DIDN'T TALK TO THEM. DO YOU HAVE ANY I.D. ON YOU? - YES, SIR, I DO. - CAN I SEE THAT? - YEAH, NO PROBLEM. - SO WE KNOW WHO'S RUNNING AROUND DOWN HERE. - NOT A PROBLEM. Mr. Xtreme: I DEFINITELY WOULD LIKE TO HAVE A WORKING RELATIONSHIP WITH THE POLICE. IN THE EARLY DAYS I WAS TRYING TO TAKE A MORE PROACTIVE APPROACH. I SHOWED UP AT THE POLICE STATION. BUT THAT JUST DIDN'T PAN OUT TOO WELL JUST BECAUSE A LOT OF TIMES I WOULD BE ASKED TO LEAVE OR THEY WOULD JUST FLIP OUT AND DEMAND THAT I TAKE OFF MY COSTUME, TAKE OFF MY MASK. SO NOW, MOST OF THE TIME, I JUST WAIT FOR PEOPLE TO APPROACH ME. VIGILANTE SPIDER, DO SOMETHING. UM... ( camera shutter clicks ) OKAY, THAT WORKS. Mr. Xtreme: I GET ASKED THAT QUESTION A LOT, OF WHY I DON'T CHOOSE REGULAR LAW ENFORCEMENT. ME PERSONALLY-- I SIMPLY DON'T WANT TO BE A COP. I DON'T WANT TO JUST DO THIS AS A JOB AND HAVE TO REPORT TO SOME CRAPPY-ASS BOSS. FOR ME IT'S ABOUT BELIEFS. YOU KNOW, I AM A STUDENT OF CRIMINAL JUSTICE AND POLICE SCIENCES. BUT THAT'S FOR MY BENEFIT HERE AS MR. XTREME AND THE XTREME JUSTICE LEAGUE. Lieutenant Andra Brown: WHILE ON THE SURFACE THERE MIGHT SEEM TO BE SOME SIMILARITIES BECAUSE WE BOTH WEAR UNIFORMS, WE BOTH WEAR SOMETHING THAT IDENTIFIES US. THE POLICE OFFICER'S UNIFORM GIVES PEOPLE CONFIDENCE THAT A TRAINED PROFESSIONAL IS HERE, SOMEONE THAT THEY RECOGNIZE AS SOMEONE TO HELP THEM IS HERE. UNFORTUNATELY, A LOT OF PEOPLE SEE A REAL-LIFE SUPERHERO COSTUME, AND THEY THINK OF IT AS JUST THAT-- A COSTUME. WE'RE GOING. WE'RE DOING IT. - OH MY GOD. - ( screams ) GOOD EVENING. OH MY GOD. I AM A KNIGHT FROM HELL COME TO SALT LAKE CITY TO TRY TO PROMOTE GOOD AND WELL-BEING. MY OUTFIT-- IT'S ALL BLACK FOR A REASON. IT'S SO I CAN BLEND IN WITH THE DARK. IT'S INTIMIDATION AND A FEAR TACTIC. MY COSTUME IS SIMPLE. IT'S SUPPOSED TO JUST BE SOMETHING THAT I CAN SLIP INTO REALLY QUICKLY. I REALLY VEERED TOWARD A COSTUME THAT DEFINITELY WAS A CLASSIC SUPERHERO IMAGE, VERY RECOGNIZABLE. BUT AT THE SAME TIME, YOU KNOW, I'M WEARING A TIE, I'M WEARING A VEST. I'M HERE TO DO BUSINESS. I WANT IT TO BE FUNCTIONAL. I WANT IT TO BE PRAGMATIC. I'M MORE ABOUT HAVING SOMETHING THAT'S PROTECTIVE. I LEARNED THAT PROTECTION WAS VERY VERY IMPORTANT. IT GIVES ME PROTECTION, ALSO HAS PADDING IN IT. AND IT'S MY STYLE. MY MAIN INSPIRATION WAS MANGAVERSE SPIDER-MAN. I GOT THE INSPIRATION FOR THE HELMET AS WELL AS THE GOGGLES FROM THE POWER RANGERS. THE SHADOW, THE GREEN HORNET, THE QUESTION. THE GREEN HORNET AND OF COURSE THE SPIRIT. MY COLORS ARE INSPIRED BY SUPERMAN AND ZORRO. SILVER AND BLACK-- THOSE ARE THE COLORS THAT YOU'LL ALWAYS BE ABLE TO EXPECT ME IN. IT'S HARD TO BE BLACK AND WHITE IN THE VERY GRAY WORLD THAT WE LIVE IN. I DO THIS WEARING A MASK AND A COSTUME BECAUSE IT DRAWS ATTENTION TO WHAT I'M DOING. AND IN DRAWING ATTENTION TO WHAT I'M DOING, IT DRAWS ATTENTION TO THE PROBLEMS THAT I'M FACING AND I'M TRYING TO WORK ON. I DON'T FEEL LIKE I WEAR A COSTUME. I FEEL LIKE I WEAR A UNIFORM. IT'S MEANT TO BE A TOOL-- A TOOL THAT I CAN USE TO LIVE A LIFE THAT IS ADVENTUROUS AND BOLD AND HELPS OTHER PEOPLE. "OH, WELL, WHY DO YOU HAVE TO DO IT IN A COSTUME?" I SAY, "OH, I DON'T HAVE TO DO IT IN A COSTUME. I DO IT IN A COSTUME SO THAT I CAN BE A SYMBOL AND I CAN BE, YOU KNOW, OUTSTANDING IN MY COMMUNITY." AND THEN ONE DAY I WAS JUST HONEST WITH MYSELF AND REALIZED I DO IT BECAUSE IT'S HELLA FUN. Lucid: I'VE ALWAYS HAD A FAIRLY ABNORMAL APTITUDE TOWARDS VIOLENCE. I DON'T KNOW. I'M NOT SURE IF IT WAS MY UPBRINGING OR WHAT, BUT ADRENALINE AND RAGE HAVE BEEN A VERY VITAL PART OF MY LIFE. IT'S MY CONFLICTION AND YET MY PASSION. FOR ME IT'S NOT SO DIFFICULT TO GET INTO THE MIND OF A CRIMINAL, BECAUSE I USED TO BE A CRIMINAL. YOU KNOW, I USED TO SELL DRUGS. I USED TO WOMANIZE. I USED TO BE BORDERLINE ALCOHOLIC. YOU NAME IT. I DO THIS BECAUSE IT GIVES ME AN OUTLET. IT MAKES ME FEEL LIKE I'M DOING SOMETHING A LITTLE BIT BEYOND ANYBODY ELSE. AND IT TAKES UP SOMETHING THAT I GAVE UP-- THE ALCOHOL. YEAH, I GREW UP IN A BAD NEIGHBORHOOD. I USED TO BE AFFILIATED WITH GANGS. SO COMING INTO THIS, IT'S LIKE I NEEDED TO MAKE THE CHANGE. THAT'S WHY LOOKING AT THE MASK SOMETIMES, IT STILL REMINDS ME THAT I ALWAYS HAD THAT BAD SIDE, BUT NOW IT'S TIME TO TAKE CONTROL OVER IT AND DO GOOD. Mr. Xtreme: WHEN I WAS A TEENAGER I GOT JUMPED BY GANG MEMBERS AND IT TOOK ME-- IT TOOK ME A WHILE TO EVEN BE ABLE TO WALK DOWN THE STREET. I REALLY WANTED TO HURT PEOPLE. AND I WANTED TO FIND SOMEBODY THAT I COULD HURT. THAT TRANSLATED TO MUGGERS AND RAPISTS AND PEDOPHILES, AND ANYBODY THAT SOCIETY SAW AS THEIR MOST HEINOUS OFFENDERS. AND I REALLY JUST WANTED TO GO OUT AND FIND THOSE GUYS AND I WANTED TO HURT THEM. AND, YOU KNOW, ONCE OR TWICE I-- I THINK I WENT A LITTLE-- I WENT A LITTLE OVERBOARD ON SOME PEOPLE, YOU KNOW? FOR REAL-LIFE SUPERHEROES, THEY MAY HAVE EXPERIENCED SIGNIFICANT ADVERSITY OR TRAUMA THAT LEFT THEM WITH A SENSE OF MISSION AND PURPOSE. OFTEN THE ANSWER THAT THEY END UP FINDING IS, "THIS HAPPENED TO ME FOR A REASON, AND IT IS SO THAT I CAN DO GOOD." I LEARNED TO FUNNEL MY RAGE IN A WAY THAT'S BECOME PRODUCTIVE, A WAY THAT CAN ACTUALLY BENEFIT PEOPLE INSTEAD OF JUST HURTING PEOPLE. YOU KNOW, I FEEL LIKE THROUGHOUT MY LIFE I HAVE HURT ENOUGH PEOPLE WHERE I FEEL LIKE I NEED TO GIVE BACK. ( drill buzzing ) Robin S. Rosenberg: THERE'S SOME PSYCHOLOGICAL RESEARCH ON MASKING AND PEOPLE REPORT FEELING MORE ANONYMOUS IN THE SENSE THAT THEY FEEL LESS LIKE THEIR USUAL SELVES, SO IT'S EASIER, IN A SENSE; THAT BY DONNING THE COSTUME, THEY ARE ALLOWING THEIR ALTER EGO, IF YOU WILL, TO COME OUT MORE READILY. TO TAKE A TRAUMATIC EVENT AND FIND MEANING FROM IT BY WANTING THEN TO DO GOOD FOR OTHERS IS A WONDERFUL GIFT BOTH TO ONESELF AND TO OTHER PEOPLE. Master Legend: MY DAD PUT ME IN THE KU KLUX KLAN. AND I WAS PUT INTO A RING WHERE I USED TO HAVE TO FIGHT PEOPLE, HAD TO FIGHT MY FRIENDS AND EVERYTHING ELSE. AND ME AND MY FRIEND WOULD HATE IT, BUT WE WERE FORCED TO DO IT. IF I DIDN'T WIN THE FIGHT, I WOULDN'T GET NO DINNER THAT NIGHT AND I'D BE LOCKED IN A CLOSET FOR THE NIGHT. I NEVER CHOSE THAT-- THAT LIFE, BUT I WAS FORCED INTO IT. IT WAS BY THE GOOD GRACES OF MY GRANDMA-- MY GRANDMA HAD TAUGHT ME ALL THE THINGS OF BEING A GOOD CHRISTIAN MAN. AND I REALIZED THEN THAT EVEN THOUGH I WAS TAUGHT BY PEOPLE OF HATRED, THAT MY POWERS WERE TO BE USED TO DO GOOD THINGS. SO THAT'S WHAT I DO. ( gulping ) AH! ALL RIGHT, DELICIOUS. WE'RE GONNA DO THE BEST WE CAN HERE, IF SECURITY HASN'T STOPPED ME FROM MY ANTICS. PEOPLE GET A LITTLE WORRIED, IT SEEMS. HEY, WHY SHOULD THEY BE WORRIED? IT'S MY LIFE. UH-OH. WE'RE GONNA DIE. EH, ALL RIGHT. NOW YOU DON'T WANT THIS DOOR TO CLOSE ON YOU, JUST IN CASE WE CAN'T GET THROUGH THE OTHER DOOR. SO I'LL USE THIS SHIRT. ( grunts ) UH-OH. THIS IS THE OVERALL VIEW OF ORLANDO. THIS IS THE TOWN THAT I DEFEND, THAT I LOOK UP AND TRY TO DO MY BEST TO HELP THE PEOPLE OF THIS CITY. THAT COURTHOUSE THERE IS ACTUALLY A PLACE OF EVIL. WHAT THEY'RE DOING IS THROWING HOMELESS PEOPLE IN JAIL, AND PEOPLE FOR PETTY LITTLE CRIMES LIKE SHOPLIFTING OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT, JUST TRYING TO GET A MEAL TO EAT. AND THEY THROW THEM IN JAIL JUST TO MAKE MONEY. AND THAT'S WHAT THAT COURTHOUSE DOES. IT'S A COURTHOUSE OF EVIL, JUST SO YOU KNOW. MASTER LEGEND TOLD YOU. ALL RIGHT, LET'S GO IN HERE AND IF Y'ALL DON'T MIND, I'M A LITTLE THIRSTY. IF YOU DON'T MIND, LET'S HAVE OURSELVES A DRINK. HEY THERE. I'M MASTER LEGEND - AND A REAL-LIFE S-- - DO YOU HAVE A CARD? NO, I'M SORRY. - I DON'T HAVE NO CARDS WITH ME. - AWW. - I CHANGED MY NUMBER RECENTLY, SO MY CARDS AREN'T NO GOOD. - OH, GOT IT. BECAUSE OF CONSTANT THREATS AND ALL THAT, - YOU KNOW, BEING-- - OH NO. YEAH, YOU WOULDN' BELIEVE IT, - BUT AS BEING A REAL-LIFE SUPERHERO... - ( laughs ) ...YOU RUN INTO THAT KIND OF STUFF. - YOU DO. - I BET YOU DO, YEAH. OH, THANK YOU VERY MUCH. YOU KNOW, A SUPERHERO WORKS UP A WHOPPING THIRST. YEAH, ARE YOU HERE FOR THE--? OOPS. ( laughs ) DO YOU LIVE HERE IN FLORIDA? I DO. I GO TO SCHOOL HERE. OH, YOU'RE GOING TO SCHOOL. AND WHAT ARE YOU TAKING UP? I'M A PSYCHOLOGY MAJOR. PSYCHOLOGY? I TELL PEOPLE ALL THE TIME THAT PSYCHOLOGY IS PROBABLY ONE OF THE GREATEST WEAPONS AGAINST EVIL AND ALL THAT THERE IS. - I'M GONNA WRITE DOWN A FEW THINGS HERE. - OKAY, COOL. - I ALWAYS TRY TO KEEP SOME PAPER HANDY. - OH, THAT'S REALLY SMART. I HAVE A NON-PROFIT ORGANIZATION KNOWN AS TEAM JUSTICE. OKAY, COOL. AND WE'RE NOT ASKING FOR DONATIONS, BUT AT LEAST WE'RE LEGITIMATE. OH, WELL, IT'S NICE MEETING YOU, MASTER LEGEND. - I SURELY LIKED MEETING YOU TOO. - THANKS. YOU'RE A VERY PRETTY LADY. AND LET ME SEE-- TERESA? - WHAT WAS IT? - TIFFANY. TIFFANY. I'M SORRY. WELL, IT'S BEEN GREAT TO BE IN THE COMPANY OF VERY BEAUTIFUL WOMEN. BUT SOON WE WILL GET ON OUR WAY TO GO HELP OUT SOME DESPERATE PEOPLE. IT'LL BE FUN. Z: I REALLY STARTED RUNNING AROUND WITH A MASK ON AT NIGHT, THINKING I WAS GOING TO DO SOMETHING, YOU KNOW? BUT THE PEOPLE WHO DO THE KIND OF STUFF THAT I'M OUT THERE TO STOP-- THERE'S GUYS THAT WANT TO TAKE, YOU KNOW, ADVANTAGE OF PEOPLE THAT ARE AT ONE OF THEIR WEAKEST MOMENTS, THEY DON'T-- THEY DON'T DO IT OBVIOUSLY. YOU KNOW, THEY'RE-- THEY'RE GOOD AT IT. YOU KNOW? SO WHAT YOU GOTTA DO IS YOU GOT TO PUT A LITTLE BAIT OUT THERE FOR THEM. I ALWAYS THINK ABOUT THE THREE TYPES OF PEOPLE THAT DO THINGS IN THE STREET AT NIGHT, AND THAT'S-- YOU GOT YOUR MUGGERS, YOUR RAPISTS AND YOUR CAR THIEVES. BEGINNING OF THE NIGHT, WE DECIDE WHETHER WE WANT TO BE MORE ARMORED OR FASTER. SO WE EITHER ARMOR UP MORE OR WE PUT ON LIGHTER CLOTHES THAT ARE DARKER, SO WE CAN BLEND IN BETTER. WE SUIT UP EITHER ZIMMER OR T.S.A.F. AND WE SEND THEM OUT INTO THE FIELD. Zimmer: BEING OPENLY GAY IS SOMETHING THAT IS VERY IMPORTANT TO ME, THAT'S VERY NEAR AND DEAR TO MY HEART. SO I NEVER PATROLLED IN A MASK, BECAUSE WEARING A MASK AND HAVING A DIFFERENT NAME AND DIFFERENT LIFE FELT TOO MUCH LIKE BEING IN THE CLOSET. MY MUGGABLE CHARACTER IS A VERY GAY FLAMBOYANT MAN. WITH THIS, WE HOPE TO BAIT PEOPLE WHO ARE HOMOPHOBIC INTO DOING SOMETHING CRIMINAL. THE OTHER THREE ACT AS BASICALLY BODYGUARDS AT A DISTANCE. Lucid: WE TRAIL THEM, KEEP IN COMMUNICATION. IF ANYTHING HAPPENS, WE ROLL IN. YOU KNOW, WE EITHER GRAB I.D.s TO TRAIL THE PERP LATER OR WE DO A CITIZEN'S ARREST. Lieutenant Brown: BAIT PATROL DOES SEEM TO BE A FORM OF ENTRAPMENT. IT'S ON THE FINE LINE. BUT IF THAT PERSON, THAT BAIT, HADN'T BEEN SENT OUT THERE TO ENTICE SOMEONE TO ROB THEM OR BEAT THEM, OR WHATEVER THE OBJECT OF THAT PARTICULAR BAIT PATROL WAS, YOU KNOW, IT SOUNDS LIKE SOMEONE IS BEING ENTRAPPED AT THAT POINT. YOU'RE DEFINITELY MUGGABLE. AWESOME. I'M GLAD I'M MUGGABLE. I THINK I'M FEELING LIKE MUGGING YOU RIGHT NOW. ALL RIGHT, YEAH. I THINK ANYONE SEEING ME WEARING THIS OUTFIT - WILL MUG ME ON GENERAL PRINCIPLE. - YEAH. Zimmer: SO YOU GUYS ARE GONNA LEAVE. YOU'RE GONNA WALK A BLOCK TO THE RIGHT-- WEST. WE'RE GONNA GO UP AND TAKE UP THE POST ON THE NEXT STREET UP FROM HANCOCK AND BROADWAY. RIGHT, AND THEN I'M GONNA WALK OUT. WHEN YOU SEE ME, START WALKING TO THE NEXT ONE. I'LL WALK TO YOUR POSITION. DO YOU WANT ME TO LEAVE NOW? T.S.A.F., DO YOU HAVE KEYS? ALL RIGHT. Z, LUCID, YOU GUYS, CAN YOU SEE ME? I'M LIKE A BLOCK AWAY FROM YOU. - IT'S STARTING TO RAIN. - ( thunder crashing ) Z. OH, I SEE YOU NOW. ALL RIGHT, IT LOOKS LIKE WE'RE GOING HOME. IT'S STARTING TO RAIN, SO WE'RE CALLING THIS BAIT PATROL OFF. WE'LL HEAD OUT AGAIN TOMORROW NIGHT AND SEE WHAT HAPPENS. ( tires screech ) HI. I KNOW I LOOK RIDICULOUS, BUT I'M AN E.M.T. DID THEY RUN OVER YOUR FOOT? YEAH, LOOK, IT'S GOING TO SWELL UP. I DON'T WANT TO MOVE IT. I JUST GOT HIT. YOU SEE THIS HERE? I'M PUSHING MY PUSHCART, AND IT GOES ASS OVER HEAD, AND I GO WITH IT. SO YOU THINK SHE HIT THE BIG TOE? SO WHEN IT HIT, IT--? YEAH, I HAVE NO NAIL THERE ANYMORE. RIGHT. SO BOTH OF THESE? - THESE THREE. - THESE-- THOSE THREE. - RIGHT HERE. - ALL RIGHT. Zimmer: FOR THE PAST FIVE MONTHS I'VE BEEN IN AN E.M.T. SCHOOL. I'M GOING THROUGH E.M.T. CERTIFICATION. AND I RECENTLY TOOK MY PRACTICAL SKILLS EXAM AND PASSED IT. I HAVE ONE MORE STATE WRITTEN EXAM, AND I'LL BE A FULLY-CERTIFIED E.M.T., CERTIFIED TO TREAT BULLET WOUNDS, KNIFE WOUNDS, ANY KIND OF ACCIDENTAL TRAUMA. AND I THINK THIS IS GONNA BE REALLY USEFUL FOR PATROLS, TO HAVE THAT BACKUP. - ( grunts ) - WHERE ARE YOU HEADED? WE'LL WALK YOU HOME. - I'M GOING RIGHT HERE, COME ON. - ALL RIGHT. I WANT YOU TO TELL MY WIFE WHAT HAPPENED. Lucid: WE SET IT UP PERFECTLY, AND YET EVERYTHING FELL APART, YOU KNOW. THERE WAS NOTHING WE COULD DO. IT'S COMPLETELY OUT OF OUR CONTROL. BUT THEN, YOU KNOW, THE STREET KIND OF GAVE BACK A LITTLE BIT. IT WAS VERY SERENDIPITOUS WHERE THERE WAS STILL-- YOU KNOW, THERE WAS STILL A LOT OF GOOD THAT COULD BE DONE. COME ON. LET'S GET OUT OF HERE. A STRING OF GROPING ATTACKS ON WOMEN IN CHULA VISTA HAS MANY PEOPLE ON EDGE. IN RESPONSE, A MEMBER OF THE XTREME JUSTICE LEAGUE-- THERE IS SUCH A THING-- HAS ARRIVED IN COSTUME TO HELP POLICE TRACK DOWN THE GROPER AND FIGHT CRIME. HE HAS THIS MESSAGE FOR THE MAN WHO'S BEEN ON THE PROWL SINCE LAST SEPTEMBER, STRIKING FEAR IN THE COMMUNITY: YOU CAN RUN, BUT YOU CAN'T HIDE. AND ALL I CAN SAY IS, YOU KNOW: OUR SCENE IS YOUR FEAR; EVILDOERS BEWARE; AND XTREME JUSTICE-- THIS IS NOT THE N.F.L., THIS IS THE X.J.L. Mr. Xtreme's mom: MY SISTER CALLED ME UP. SHE SAW SOMEBODY IN THE NEWS. AND FROM THE WAY HE TALK AND THE WAY HE WALK, SHE RECOGNIZED HIM. AND SHE TOLD ME IT'S ALMOST 100% IT'S MY OLDEST SON. MY PARENTS? YEAH, THEY TRY TO DISCOURAGE ME, BUT PRETTY MUCH I'VE GOTTEN USED TO IT. AND I THINK THEY'RE PRETTY MUCH GONNA GET USED TO, YOU KNOW, THE CHOSEN PATH IN MY LIFE. Mr. Xtreme's mom: I DO NOT APPROVE WHAT HE MAKES CHOICE. MY HUSBAND DID NOT APPROVE THAT NEITHER. BUT WE STAND BY HIM AND WE SUPPORT HIM. IT IS A GOOD THING-- A GOOD THING FOR OTHERS. MIGHT NOT BE A GOOD THING FOR HIMSELF. Mr. Xtreme: I'M CURRENTLY A WHITE BELT IN BRAZILIAN JU-JITSU. AND I'M PREPARING FOR MY FIRST TOURNAMENT THIS WEEKEND TO HOPEFULLY ADVANCE TO THE BLUE BELT LEVEL. IT'S AN EVENT CALLED "GRAPPLING X"-- BASICALLY A FREESTYLE SUBMISSION GRAPPLING TOURNAMENT. THAT'S WHAT I'M HOPING TO DO-- YOU KNOW, SHOW THEM I GOT WHAT IT TAKES. PARTICIPATING IN AN ACTUAL TOURNAMENT IS PROBABLY AS REALISTIC TO REAL COMBAT AS YOU CAN GET. IT REALLY SIMULATES THE STRESS OF A REAL SITUATION. Mr. Xtreme's mom: I THINK HE DID HIS BEST. BUT BEING WORKING, LIKE, ALMOST TWO FULL-TIME JOBS, HE REALLY DIDN'T HAVE THE ENERGY AND PRACTICE TO FIGHT WITH THESE STRONG GUYS. BUT I BELIEVE IF YOU DID YOUR BEST, WHATEVER OUTCOME, DOESN'T MATTER. HE WAS A REALLY HAPPY BABY UNTIL 17 MONTHS LATER WHEN I WENT TO THE HOSPITAL TO GIVE BIRTH TO HIS BROTHER. HE ASKED HIS GRANDMA WHERE WAS MOMMY. HIS GRANDMA TOLD HIM, BECAUSE HE WAS A BAD BOY, HIS MOMMY WENT TO THE HOSPITAL TO GET ANOTHER NEW BABY. EVER SINCE THEN HE WAS REALLY SAD. Mr. Xtreme: I'M GONNA BE MOVING OUT OF THE XTREME CAVE, XTREME OPS, BECAUSE I DON'T WANT TO LIVE IN THE SAME COMMUNITY THAT I PATROL IN IF I CAN HELP IT. SAY, IF I EVER COME ACROSS A SITUATION-- I THWART A DRUG DEAL OR I PISS OFF ONE OF THESE VILLAINS, ONE OF THESE EVILDOERS, AND THEY FIND OUT WHERE I LIVE. AND THE LAST THING I NEED TO DO IS, OH, AT 3:00 IN THE MORNING THEY COME UP AND SHOOT UP MY HOUSE, OR FUCKING THROW A MOLOTOV COCKTAIL IN MY YARD OR SOMETHING. MY DAD DOESN'T LIKE ME BEING A REAL-LIFE SUPERHERO AT ALL. WHEN HE FOUND OUT, HE JUST WAS PRETTY UPSET. HE'S VERY MUCH AGAINST IT. AND HE WANTS ME TO-- WANTS ME TO QUIT. Mr. Xtreme's dad: VERY DANGEROUS, AND I KEEP TELLING HIM, "YOU NEED TO STOP." IT DOESN'T MATTER IF YOU HAVE A BULLETPROOF VEST OR WHATEVER PROTECTION YOU HAVE. ALL IT TAKES IS ONE GOOD SHOT, AND YOU'RE DONE. I DON'T WANT TO HAVE A CALL AT 2:30 IN THE MORNING AND THEN GO IDENTIFY THE BODY. THAT'S WHAT I DON'T WANT. Mr. Xtreme: I'M TRYING TO OPERATE WITH LESS SPACE, SO I CAN HAVE MORE MONEY TO SPEND. SO I'M GONNA BE KIND OF CAMPING OUT IN A VAN. THE MONEY THAT I WON'T BE SPENDING ON RENT-- I'M GONNA BE USING IT TO PAY FOR EQUIPMENT, PRINTING, AND MORE MONEY INTO MY TRAINING NEEDS. Mr. Xtreme's mom: I DIDN'T THINK MY SON IS A SUPERHERO. SOMEONE SAID, "HE'S A FOOL." I DON'T THINK HE'S NEITHER SUPERHERO OR A FOOL. TO ME, HE'S JUST A SIMPLE PERSON. HE KNOWS HOW TO GIVE, BUT HE NEVER KNOWS HOW TO ASK FOR HELP FOR HIMSELF. AND THAT'S IT. WHEN YOU'RE A MAN THAT'S HAD AS MANY INJURIES THAT I'VE HAD, YOU KNOW, YOU DESERVE A BEER. I'VE HAD MORE INJURIES THAN EVEL KNIEVEL, AND HE'S ALL WASHED UP AND DEAD NOW. BUT GUESS WHAT. MASTER LEGEND'S NOT. ( grunts ) I REALLY DON'T LIKE TO HAVE A LOT OF WEAPONS... BECAUSE I'VE GOT SPIRITUAL POWERS BEYOND THAT OF ORDINARY MORTAL PEOPLE. BUT STILL, THOUGH, I DO CARRY A FEW WEAPONS AROUND. THIS CAME FROM NEUROCYBE'X. MY GOOD FRIEND NEUROCYBE'X GAVE ME THIS. SUPERHEROES, UNLESS THEY HAPPEN TO ALSO BE A POLICE OFFICER, ARE NOT TRAINED LAW ENFORCEMENT PROFESSIONALS. I THINK THAT CARRYING WEAPONS IS A BAD IDEA. THIS LOOKS LIKE AN INNOCENT ENOUGH FLASHLIGHT. THROW A SWITCH-- 90,000-VOLT STUN GUN. I DO LIKE TO KNOW WHAT I'M WORKING WITH. I HAVE BEEN MACED BEFORE. IT'S UNPLEASANT. I HAVE BEEN TASED BY MY OWN STUN GUN BEFORE-- AGAIN, EQUALLY UNPLEASANT. 16" BATONS. AND I WILL PULL THESE AND DEFEND MYSELF AND ANYBODY ELSE THAT'S IN THE AREA WITH THEM. THIS IS A NICE LITTLE RING I CREATED CALLED "THE PHARAOH'S FIRE"-- FOR DISTRACTION. THIS HERE IS THE IRON FIST-- THE IRON FIST, CAPABLE OF DEMOLISHING MANY THINGS. Zimmer: AN AVERAGE MILITARY TACTICAL FLASHLIGHT, A REALLY REALLY BRIGHT ONE, WILL BE 100-115 LUMENS. THIS GOES UP TO 500 LUMENS. THIS COULD BE A REALLY GOOD DISTRACTION TOOL. BEAR MACE IS ACTUALLY WAY STRONGER THAN C.N. OR O.C. OR C.S. AND THE REASON I LIKE A BIG CAN OF IT IS BECAUSE YOU GET MUCH MORE DISTANCE. I'VE COME ACROSS THINGS THAT I CAN'T SEE VERY WELL. MY EYES ARE GOING ON ME. THIS LASER-- IT'S A 3A LASER. - SONIC GRENADE. - ( beeping ) I HAVE THE NEW TIGERLIGHT T100. A MINI-BLOWTORCH, AIR HORN. I ACTUALLY INCORPORATE SOME TOOTSIE ROLLS. I DON'T KNOW WHY. WHAT IT BASICALLY DOES IS TURN A SERIES OF FLASHING LIGHTS AND PLUGS IT IN RIGHT IN FRONT OF YOUR EYES. AND THEY PULSE IN BRAINWAVE FREQUENCIES. PEPPER SPRAY. MACE PEPPER GUN. AND IT LOOKS LIKE MY SNAKE LIGHT IS DEAD RIGHT NOW. Super Hero: KEEP IT ON THE SIDE OF YOUR RIG. IT DOESN'T GET IN THE WAY, BUT WHEN YOU NEED IT TO, OUT IT COMES LIKE THAT. BECAUSE WHEN I SHOOT YOU, WHEN I-- AN ICE CUBE THROUGH YOUR HEAD, AND IT MELTS AWAY, WELL, I DON'T THINK THERE'S MUCH PEOPLE GONNA BE ABLE TO SAY ANYTHING ABOUT IT. DON'T TEMPT ME, 'CAUSE I WILL DO IT. Zimmer: RIGHT NOW THE NEW YORK INITIATIVE IS TRYING TO TRAIN AND GET READY AND PREPARE. PREPARATION IS REALLY IMPORTANT AND IT'S SOMETHING THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE SKIP OVER. T.S.A.F.: WE'RE NOT PROFESSIONALS. WE'RE NOT PEOPLE THAT HAVE BEEN TRAINED TO DO THIS SORT OF WORK. THIS IS-- THIS IS ALL GROUNDBREAKING. THIS IS ALL THE FIRST TIME IT'S BEEN DONE THIS WAY. AND WE'RE LEARNING. ALL RIGHT, OW. - YOU OKAY? - YEAH. NO BLOOD. T.S.A.F.: I THINK IT STARTS WITH THE INDIVIDUAL. WHEN PEOPLE BEGIN TO TAKE ACCOUNTABILITY FOR THEMSELVES, THEN I THINK WE CAN SEE CHANGE. REMEMBER, TONIGHT ONLY USE CODE NAMES-- Z, LUCID, T.S.A.F., ZIMMER-- NOTHING ELSE. NO REAL NAMES. ( radio chirps ) Lucid over radio: 10-4. ( dogs barking ) ( speaking over radio ) Lucid: JESUS CHRIST. ( Lucid sighs ) Z: Everybody copy that? T.S.A.F.: Copy. Zimmer: Copy. I THINK WE SHOULD TAKE A LEFT AND START HEADING WEST. THERE'S JUST NO PEOPLE OUT HERE, MAN. ( sighs ) IT'S TAKING A LONG TIME TO CATCH ANY KIND OF GROUND. Z: Test test test. Lucid: COPY. HE'S GONNA HIT THAT-- OH, HE'S GONNA HIT THAT FUCKING CAR. YEP. GOD DAMN. GET HIS LICENSE PLATE. GUYS, GOT 8-- GO AHEAD. GO AHEAD. Z: Get his fucking plate number. T.S.A.F.: COULD YOU REPEAT THAT? Lucid: That Land Rover right there, guys, that just passed you taking a right-- GET HIS LICENSE PLATE. HE JUST HIT THIS CAR OVER HERE. THIS LAND ROVER? HE TOOK A RIGH OVER THIS WAY. ARE YOU-- ARE YOU OKAY? Zimmer: THIS GUY WAS REALLY ANGRY. WE THOUGHT IT WOULD BE BEST IF HE WAS NOT DRIVING TONIGHT, IF HE WAS ALREADY SIDESWIPING A VEHICLE. ( mumbling unintelligibly ) - T.S.A.F.: YOU NEED TO PICK UP SOME DRUGS? - YEAH. - YOU'RE NOT DOING ANYTHING RIGHT NOW. - I HAVE TO GO NOW. Zimmer: WE CALLED THE POLICE TWICE. WE GAVE A DESCRIPTION OF THE VEHICLE, LICENSE PLATES. - STANHOPE AND CENTRAL AVENUE? - Lucid: YES. Zimmer: THEY SAID THEY WERE SENDING A PATROL VEHICLE OVER. FINALLY A COP CAR CAME BY AFTER I CALLED THE SECOND TIME. YO! WE TRIED TO FLAG THEM DOWN, BUT THEY ROLLED RIGHT ON BY. THEY DIDN'T EVEN STOP. SO THAT WAS REALLY FRUSTRATING. AT THIS POINT WE KNEW THAT THE POLICE WEREN'T GOING TO BE RELIABLE FOR THIS SITUATION. SO WE GOT CONSENT FROM THE GUY TO TAKE HIS KEYS. I'M GONNA MAIL THEM BACK TO HIM TOMORROW. - I'M CALLING YOU RIGHT NOW. - NO, GIVE ME YOUR NUMBER. - ( cell phone rings ) - I'M CALLING YOU. SEE? NOW YOU HAVE MY NUMBER. YOU CAN CALL ME. I'M GONNA MAIL YOU YOUR KEYS, ALL RIGHT? SHH. ALL RIGHT. HAVE A GOOD NIGHT, BROTHER. HAVE A GOOD NIGHT. - TAKE CARE. - ALL RIGHT, YOU TOO. Zimmer: AS FAR AS I KNOW, HE'S PASSED OUT IN HIS CAR SAFE AND SOUND, NOT DRIVING DRUNK TONIGHT. IS HE OKAY? YOU'RE MAILING THE GUY'S KEYS BACK TO HIM TOMORROW, RIGHT? Zimmer: YES. PROBABLY SAVED HIS LIFE AND SOMEONE ELSE'S. Mr. Xtreme: THERE'S A LOT OF-- A LOT OF BAD APPLES AROUND HERE. YOU KNOW, AND THIS AREA'S NOT NECESSARILY BAD, BUT YOU HAVE, LIKE, A LOT OF THESE-- A LOT OF THESE SLIMEBALLS AND, YOU KNOW, SLEAZE BUCKETS THAT DRIVE AROUND LOOKING FOR PEOPLE TO PREY ON. THIS DIRT LOT-- A LOT OF COLLEGE STUDENTS-- THEY USE IT AS A SHORTCUT. BACK IN OCTOBER OF LAST YEAR A YOUNG FEMALE COLLEGE STUDENT WAS FOLLOWED BY SIX MEN. THEY PINNED HER DOWN AND SEXUALLY ASSAULTED HER. I MYSELF-- I WISH I WAS THERE THAT NIGHT. THIS SENSELESS VIOLENCE LIKE THIS-- WHAT HAPPENED TO THIS VICTIM, IT MAKES ME FEEL VERY ANGRY. IT KIND OF LEAVES ME ALSO IN A STATE OF DISILLUSIONMENT ABOUT SOCIETY IN GENERAL. I HAVE A PICTURE OF KITTY GENOVESE ON MY UNIFORM. "38 WITNESSES"-- IT REPRESENTS THE 38 PEOPLE THAT SHUT THE WINDOW, THAT PULLED THE BLINDS DOWN-- YOU KNOW, THE PEOPLE THAT JUST DIDN'T DO ANYTHING. THINGS LIKE THAT JUST SHOULDN'T HAPPEN, YOU KNOW, BUT UNFORTUNATELY IT STILL DOES. THERE'S REAL FACES BEHIND, YOU KNOW, ALL THIS VIOLENCE, ALL THIS MADNESS, ALL THIS CHAOS GOING ON OUT THERE. THAT'S PART OF THE REASON WHY THIS MOVEMENT EXISTS. THE URBAN AVENGER-- HE HAS BEEN WITHIN THE R.L.S.H. COMMUNITY FOR ABOUT TWO MONTHS NOW. AND HE'S PROVEN TO BE VERY DEDICATED. I CONTACTED MR. XTREME AFTER REALIZING I WANTED TO BECOME A SUPERHERO. I ACTUALLY HEARD ABOUT HIM FROM A FRIEND OF MINE WHO HAD READ ABOUT HIM IN THE MEDIA. I'D SAY I'M EXTREMELY COMMITTED. IT'S SOMETHING I REALLY BELIEVE IN. Mr. Xtreme: EARLY FRIDAY MORNING A YOUNG GIRL-- SHE WAS ONLY 15 YEARS OLD-- SHE WAS GUNNED DOWN AT THE PARK JUST RIGHT DOWN THE STREET FROM US. SHE WAS JUST HANGING OUT WITH SOME FRIENDS. NO SUSPECTS. NO ARRESTS HAVE BEEN MADE. WE'RE OUT HERE HOLDING THIS CANDLELIGHT VIGIL TO SHOW SUPPORT FOR THE FAMILY. YOU KNOW, 15 YEARS OLD. YOU KNOW, HER LIFE HAS NOT EVEN BEGUN YET. THERE WAS A GUY WHO GOT STABBED. AND HE WAS RIGHT OUT-- RIGHT ON THE STREET-- A BUSY STREET. NOBODY STOPPED TO HELP HIM. THERE WAS BLOOD EVERYWHERE. NOBODY CALLED THE POLICE. NOBODY EVEN BOTHERED. Omen: SEVEN YEARS OR SO AGO I HAD A FRIEND WHO WAS BEATEN TO DEATH IN THE MIDDLE OF THE DAY. AND NOBODY STOPPED AT ALL TO HELP HIM. AND SO I VOWED FROM THAT DAY FORTH TO BASICALLY PREVENT STUFF LIKE THAT HAPPENING. I JUST NEVER WANT THAT TO HAPPEN AGAIN. APATHY IS EVERYWHERE. PEOPLE DON'T CARE. APATHY IS THE DRIVING FORCE IN TODAY'S SOCIETY, I THINK. Mr. Xtreme: YOU KNOW, PEOPLE LOOK AT US AS, OH, WE'RE NOT NORMAL. BUT PEOPLE THAT ARE SITTING IDLY BY AS THUGS AND KILLERS TAKE OVER OUR COMMUNITIES-- THOSE PEOPLE, IN MY BOOK, ARE NOT THE NORMAL ONES. WE'RE THE NORMAL ONES. WE'RE THE ONES THAT ARE CIVIL-MINDED. YEAH, I KNOW THAT IT PUTS PEOPLE IN DANGER TO SPEAK UP, TO SAY SOMETHING. BUT WHAT IF IT WERE YOU? WHAT IF IT WERE YOUR BROTHER, YOUR SISTER, ANY FAMILY MEMBER, ANYBODY YOU CARE ABOUT, YOUR FRIEND? ARE YOU GONNA STAND BY AND SAY NOTHING? Mr. Xtreme: IN THIS DAY AND AGE WITH ALL THE GLORIFICATION OF VIOLENCE, IT SEEMS LIKE LIFE MEANS NOTHING. BUT LIFE-- LIFE IS EVERYTHING. AND IT'S SOMETHING THAT CAN NEVER BE TAKEN FOR GRANTED. Dark Guardian: MY FAMILY IS VERY SUPPORTIVE OF WHAT I DO. BUT IN DOING DANGEROUS THINGS LIKE, YOU KNOW, CONFRONTING DRUG DEALERS AND CRIMINALS, THEY FEAR FOR MY SAFETY. OF COURSE I DON'T WANT TO HAVE ANYTHING HAPPEN TO MYSELF, BUT IT'S PART OF THE JOB. I'M TRYING TO LIVE UP TO BEING A SUPERHERO IN REAL LIFE. YOU KNOW, TAKING THE RISK I DO IS-- IT'S ABOUT MAKING A DIFFERENCE, YOU KNOW, WHATEVER THE COST. YOU GOTTA GO. YOU GOTTA GET OUT OF THE PARK. I GOT YOU ON VIDEO. I GOT YOU ON AUDIO SELLING DRUGS. YOU GOTTA LEAVE. WHAT DID I SELL, DUDE? YOU KNOW HOW LONG I'VE BEEN SITTING HERE, MAN? WHO ARE YOU ANYWAY, MAN? WHAT THE FUCK? WHO ARE YOU? YOU KNOW HOW LONG I'VE BEEN SITTING HERE? DUDE, YOU'RE ON FILM RIGHT THERE, DUDE. YOU KNOW HOW LONG I'VE BEEN SITTING HERE, MAN? - YOU KNOW HOW LONG I'VE BEEN SITTING HERE? - I DON'T CARE, DUDE. YOU'RE NOT SELLING OUT HERE. YOU'RE BREAKING THE LAW. YOU KNOW HOW LONG I'VE BEEN SITTING HERE, MAN? HOW LONG YOU BEEN LOOKING AT ME? - YOU LOOKING FOR A SCENE, MAN? YOU A COP OR SOMETHING? - NO, DUDE. - YOU'D BETTER BE A COP. ARE YOU A COP? - DUDE, DON'T DO THAT, BRO. - YOU'D BETTER HAVE A BADGE, MAN. - DON'T DO NOTHING, BRO. IF YOU DON'T HAVE A BADGE, DON'T COME OVER HERE FUCKING WITH ME, MAN. - DUDE, COME ON. - ALL RIGHT? MIND YOUR FUCKING BUSINESS, ALL RIGHT? NO. THIS IS MY BUSINESS. - IT'S NOT YOUR BUSINESS. - YEAH, IT IS. - IT'S NOT YOUR BUSINESS. - YEAH, IT IS, BRO. ALL RIGHT. IF YOU FUCK WITH ME, YOU'RE GONNA FIND OUT TOO. ALL RIGHT? IT IS WASHINGTON SQUARE PARK. I'M ON THE NORTHEAST CORNER. YOU REALLY WANT TO HAVE A PROBLEM, DON'T YOU? YOU REALLY WANT TO HAVE A PROBLEM. OKAY. YEAH, WE'RE RIGHT ON THE INSIDE. WE'RE ON THE BENCH. HE'S WALKING AWAY NOW. Dark Guardian: I WANT TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE SOMEHOW. YOU KNOW, AND I KNOW YOU CAN DO THAT IN SO MANY DIFFERENT WAYS, BUT I WANTED TO BRING SUPERHEROES TO LIFE. AND IN DOING THIS, I FEEL LIKE I REALLY HAVE. THE COSTUME IS A SYMBOL OF SOMEBODY WHO'S GONNA STAND UP AND MAKE A DIFFERENCE, SOMEBODY WHO'S GONNA STAND UP WHEN WRONG IS GOING ON. YOU KNOW, YOU'RE NOT GONNA LOOK THE OTHER WAY OR CLOSE THE BLINDS. YOU'RE GONNA GO OUT AND HELP THAT PERSON WHO NEEDS IT. Master Legend: SOMEBODY HAS TO DO IT. SOMEBODY HAS TO GET OUT THERE AND STAND UP FOR ALL THE STARVING PEOPLE OUT HERE IN ORLANDO. SO THAT'S WHY I STARTED DOING TEAM JUSTICE OUTREACH. Super Hero: OUR YEARLY CHRISTMAS DRIVE IS THE BIGGEST AND BEST TIME OF YEAR, NOT JUST FOR TEAM JUSTICE, BUT FOR ME PERSONALLY TOO. WHAT IT'S EVOLVED INTO OVER THE YEARS IS GOING FROM HAVING A FEW BOXES TO NOW HAVING HUGE WAGONLOADS OF TOYS FOR KIDS AND EVERYTHING ELSE. AND EVERY YEAR ON CHRISTMAS DAY WE GO TO THE MISSION STREET SHELTER THAT MASTER LEGEND KNOWS ABOUT. WE HAND IT ALL OUT AND MAKE A BUNCH OF KIDS HAPPY. WHEN I FIRST STARTED OUT, MY FIRST ACTUAL DRIVE FOR CHRISTMAS MISSION CHANGED A LOT OF THE WAY I LOOKED AT THINGS. IT MADE ME REALIZE THAT A LOT OF KIDS DON'T HAVE THE KIND OF STUFF THAT MOST CHILDREN HAVE, WHERE THEY CAN OPEN UP AN X-BOX OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT. SO FOR ME, I THOUGHT IT CHANGED A LOT OF THE CHRISTMASSES FOR MOST KIDS. IT MADE THEIR CHRISTMAS, YES. THE COMMUNITY IN ORLANDO HAS REALLY STARTED TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT WE'RE THERE. MASTER LEGEND IS LIKE A LOCAL CELEBRITY. YEP, I REMEMBER THAT. HE WAS GIVING OUT A WHOLE LOT OF STUFF. THEN THEY WENT TO THE COALITION. YOU WENT TO THE COALITION AND GAVE OUT THE REST OF IT. I REMEMBER THAT-- IN A WHITE VAN. I REMEMBER THAT. YEP, AND I WAS HOMELESS, DOWN ON MY LUCK. HE DID HELP ME OUT. Master Legend: I FEEL LIKE AT LEAST I'M DOING SOMETHING, YOU KNOW? I DON'T WANT TO FEEL LIKE SOMEBODY THAT'S LAYING AROUND DOING NOTHING, NOT CARING, YOU KNOW, NOT CARING ABOUT ANYTHING THAT'S GOING ON, YOU KNOW? AT LEAST, I'M-- I'M ACCOMPLISHING SOMETHING. Man: I THINK IT'S PRETTY COOL. PEOPLE LAUGH AT HIM AT FIRST, BUT HE'S A PRETTY SERIOUS DUDE. HE COMES OVER THERE WITH COOLERS FULL OF STUFF AND SNACKS AND EVERYTHING FOR EVERYBODY, YOU KNOW? SO I THINK IT'S A PRETTY NEAT THING THAT HE'S DOING. Master Legend: YOU KNOW, THERE'S REALLY NOTHING IMPORTANT IN THIS WORLD. THAT'S WHERE PEOPLE ALWAYS MAKE A MISTAKE. NOTHING IS IMPORTANT IN THIS WORLD. WHAT'S IMPORTANT IS IN THE OTHER WORLD. Life: I THINK THAT AS OF LATE WE'VE BEEN LOSING OUR HEROES. AND PEOPLE ARE LOOKING UP TO, YOU KNOW, RAPPERS AND MOVIE STARS. AND, I MEAN, WHAT HAVE THESE PEOPLE DONE THAT'S SO GREAT THAT DESERVES THIS KIND OF IDOLATRY AND ADMIRATION? AND SO THEN I THINK PEOPLE TURN BACK TO THESE SAME CLASSIC MYTHS, WHICH IN OUR CASE IS THE SUPERHERO. WHAT I AM DOING IS MUCH MORE IMPORTANT THAN WHO I AM. I SEE PEOPLE SUFFERING THAT SHOULDN'T BE SUFFERING. I SEE PEOPLE ADDICTED TO POISONS THEY DON'T EVEN UNDERSTAND. I SEE PEOPLE DYING-- MY PEOPLE THAT I HELP. PEOPLE HAVE TO BE SHOWN THAT-- THAT PEOPLE CARE. OH. Zetaman: I TALKED TO SOME PEOPLE AND ASKED THEM, YOU KNOW, WHAT KIND OF STUFF WOULD YOU LIKE? AND THEY TOLD ME, YOU KNOW, THERE'S THINGS THAT THEY NEED. THEY NEED GARBAGE BAGS. THEY NEED EXTRA TOILET PAPER-- JUST A BASIC ONE-NIGHT KIT FOR THE STREET. HERE YOU GO. RIGHT NOW WE ARE ESTIMATING THE COST OF A ZETAPACK IS ABOUT $20. IT'S ME AND MY WIFE-- WE END UP PAYING FOR IT. Life: EXCUSE ME, MY FRIEND. HOW ARE YOU DOING? REMEMBER ME? - YEAH, HOW ARE YOU DOING? - I'M ALL RIGHT. YOU MISSED THE SOUP AGAIN TONIGHT. Life: I TALK TO PEOPLE, FIND OUT HOW THEY'RE DOING. YOU KNOW, A TOUCH IS VERY IMPORTANT. AND BASICALLY JUST TRY TO LET THE HUGE HOMELESS POPULATION OF NEW YORK KNOW THAT SOMEBODY CARES ABOUT THEM AND THEY'RE NOT FORGOTTEN. - I'M OKAY. - YOU OKAY? DO YOU NEED A PAIR OF PANTS, A T-SHIRT, SOCKS? WHERE ARE YOU SLEEPING TONIGHT? I THINK OVER HERE, LIKE AROUND HERE. - BY THE BOOKSTORE, RIGHT? - YEAH. - YEAH, I'VE SEEN YOU OVER THERE. - YEAH. YEAH, YOU MAKE UP YOUR LITTLE BED ALL NICE, RIGHT? YEAH. GOD BLESS YOU. GOD BLESS YOU, SIR. ARE YOU ALL RIGHT? GOD BLESS YOU. ALL RIGHT. - YEAH? - YEAH. - OKAY. - OKAY? ALL RIGHT. THANK YOU. THANKS, BOSS. GOD BLESS YOU. THAT'S RIGHT. THAT'S RIGHT, MAN. GOD BLESS YOU, SIR. REMIND ME AGAIN OF YOUR NAME. LEWIS, THAT'S RIGHT. - WELL, I'M LIFE. - OKAY. Life: MONEY CAN COME AND GO AND POSSESSIONS CAN COME AND GO, BUT EVERY TIME I DO A MITZVAH, EVERY TIME I DO SOME SORT OF GOOD DEED AS A SUPERHERO, IT'S THIS INCREDIBLY GOOD FEELING. AND NOBODY EVER CAN TAKE THAT AWAY FROM ME. Thanatos: THERE'S ALWAYS BEEN HEROES. JUST LATELY IT SEEMS THERE HASN'T BEEN ANY. AND THE WORLD NEEDS THEM. I CAN'T CHANGE EVERYTHING, BUT I CAN TRY. TRICK OR TREAT. - Woman: I'LL HAVE SOME WATER. - YOU WANT WATER? - Man: THANATOS? - YES. I KNOW YOU, THANATOS. MY GOD, HOW ARE YOU DOING? I AM 62 YEARS OLD. I'LL BE DOING THIS FOREVER. DO YOU NEED ANY TOILETRIES OR ANYTHING, OR DEODORANT? - Woman: OH, THANKS A LOT, MAN. - YEAH, NO PROBLEM. Zetaman: SOMETIMES IT'S REALLY REALLY HARD, BECAUSE YOU MEET SOME PEOPLE, AND THEY'RE BROKEN. THEIR SITUATION IS JUST HORRIBLE. THERE'S BEEN TIMES I'VE JUST GOTTEN HOME AND JUST BEEN LIKE, "I CAN'T DO THIS ANYMORE." BUT, YOU KNOW, I FEEL LIKE TOO I DON'T WANT TO GO HOME AND HIDE. WELL, ACTUALLY IT'S REALLY SWEET, BECAUSE I GOT ALL MY NECESSITIES-- TOILET PAPER, SOCKS. AND YOU CAN'T ASK FOR MUCH MORE, YOU KNOW? YOU CAN'T ASK FOR MUCH MORE. Apocalypse Meow: ANYTHING WE CAN DO TO INSPIRE OTHER GROUPS OF PEOPLE, TO GIVE THEM IDEAS OR TO GET THEM EXCITED ABOUT STARTING SOMETHING IN THEIR AREA-- WE WANT TO DO THAT. THERE'S NOT ENOUGH PEOPLE WHO DO WHAT WE DO. POLICE HAVE BEEN AFTER HIM FOR MONTHS, AND TONIGHT A MAN ACCUSED OF GROPING MORE THAN A DOZEN WOMEN WON'T GET THE CHANCE TO DO IT AGAIN. RIGHT NOW HE'S BEING HELD ON A PROBATION VIOLATION. HE'LL FACE OTHER CHARGES LIKELY IN THE COMING DAYS AS THE INVESTIGATION CONTINUES. Mr. Xtreme: AFTER OUR CAMPAIGN AND THE SEARCH FOR THE CHULA VISTA GROPER, DEPUTY MAYOR RUDY RAMIREZ INVITED US TO BE SPEAKERS AND HAVE A PRESENTATION ABOUT SEX OFFENDERS AT A COMMUNITY FORUM. I REALLY TREASURE THAT ANYBODY COMES FORWARD WITH PASSION TOWARDS PUBLIC SERVICE OR DOING SOMETHING, CONTRIBUTING TO THEIR COMMUNITY. THAT'S A WONDERFUL THING WHEN PEOPLE DO THAT. FRANKLY, WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH OF THAT. YOU CAN HAVE ALL THE COOLEST GADGETS OUT THERE, YOU KNOW, BUT IT'S NOT GONNA DO YOU ANY GOOD IF YOU DON'T HAVE THE RIGHT MINDSET. Rudy Ramirez: THE WORK THAT MR. XTREME HAS DONE WITH POSTING THE FLYERS CERTAINLY CONTRIBUTED TO AN AWARENESS THAT COULD POSSIBLY HAVE HAD SOMETHING TO DO WITH THE CAPTURE OF THE CHULA VISTA GROPER. IT'S ALL STUFF THAT CONTRIBUTES, I THINK, IN A POSITIVE WAY. PUBLIC AWARENESS IS SOMETHING WHERE HE CAN REALLY BE VERY VALUABLE. AND SO WE WANT TO ENCOURAGE THEM TO CONTINUE AND TO DO THEIR WORK IN A WAY THAT IS, YOU KNOW, SAFE FOR THEMSELVES AND FOR EVERYBODY INVOLVED. ( applause ) IT FEELS REALLY GREAT, YOU KNOW. IT FEELS LIKE WE'RE MAKING PROGRESS, GETTING OUR MOVEMENT AND OUR ORGANIZATION MORE INTO THE MAINSTREAM. THE ATTENTION THAT WE GET FROM THESE EVENTS GENERATES NEW MEMBERS. YOU KNOW, HAVING THESE RELATIONSHIPS-- IT'S DEFINITELY A STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION. Male reporter: SAN DIEGO'S LARGEST LOCAL EVENT IS NOW UNDERWAY AT THE FIRST FULL DAY OF COMIC-CON. THE ANNUAL CONVENTION IS EXPECTED TO DRAW MORE THAN 130,000 PEOPLE TO THE DOWNTOWN AREA THIS WEEKEND. ( distant siren wailing ) HEY, CAN YOU GUYS GET KIND OF CLOSE TOGETHER? ALL RIGHT. ( camera shutter clicks ) AWESOME. Mr. Xtreme: WELL, THIS MEETUP IS TO HELP THE HOMELESS AND THE NEEDY BY GIVING THEM WATER AND FOOD, ALSO TO JUST LET THEM KNOW THAT WE'RE THE GOOD GUYS AND WE'RE, YOU KNOW-- WE'RE HERE TO HELP, AND ALSO TO PROMOTE UNITY AND CAMARADERIE WITHIN THE REAL-LIFE SUPERHERO SCENE. Thanatos: IT'S ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT THINGS WE DO. ALL OF A SUDDEN I'M NOT THE ONLY CRAZY PERSON OUT HERE IN A MASK AND A COSTUME. I HAVE A LOT OF OTHER FRIENDS. AND WHEN WE LEAVE, WE TAKE THAT KNOWLEDGE OF HOW TO FUNCTION AS A TEAM BACK TO WHEREVER WE ARE TO MEET UP WITH OTHER PEOPLE AND SPREAD THAT. SIR, DID YOU NEED SOME COLD WATER? Urban Avenger: WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS WE'RE TRYING TO PROMOTE GOODWILL HERE TODAY. AND I THINK WE'RE DOING JUST THAT. I HOPE THIS CAMPAIGN GOES WELL. TODAY IS TODAY AND TOMORROW WILL BE ANOTHER DAY. AND HOPEFULLY TOMORROW IS JUST LIKE TODAY. BUT YOU NEVER KNOW. ONLY TIME WILL TELL. - Woman: MAN, YOU GUYS ARE FANTASTIC. - Mr. Xtreme: WE DO WHAT WE CAN. - YOU GUYS WITH COMIC-CON? - NO, ACTUALLY WE'RE-- WE'RE THE REAL DEALS. - YOU'RE THE REAL DEALS, HUH? - THE REAL DEALS. Woman: THAT'S WHAT MATTERS, MAN. Y'ALL THE REAL DEAL. Urban Avenger: YOU GUYS KEEP SAFE TODAY. - CAPTAIN SAVE-EVERYBODY. - Urban Avenger: KEEP COOL. - THANK YOU AGAIN. - SURE. Woman: WE ALL NEED SUPERHEROES IN OUR LIVES. PEOPLE LIKE THESE IS HOW COME WE ALL LIVE AND SURVIVE. THEY TAKE CARE OF US. AND IF PEOPLE SAY THEY AIN'T REAL, THEN THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT. BECAUSE THIS IS TRUE. THIS IS REAL. YOU GUYS LOOK GOOD, MAN. - YOU GUYS... - THANK YOU. Man: I THINK IT'S REMARKABLE WHAT THEY DO. I THINK IT'S VERY UNSELFISH. GOOD DAY. I APPRECIATE IT. BLESS YOU ALL. Woman: WE ALL NEED SUPERHEROES. AND THOSE ARE SUPERHEROES RIGHT THERE. WE NEED THEM MORE THAN THEY'LL EVER KNOW. Stan Lee: I ADMIRE THEIR COURAGE. I ADMIRE THEIR OBJECTIVES. AND WHATEVER THEY'RE DOING, I JUST HOPE THEY'RE SUCCESSFUL AT IT. Mr. Xtreme: I MEAN, IT'S NOT AS EXCITING AS THE MOVIES AND THE COMICS AND ALL THAT STUFF PORTRAY IT TO BE. I HAVE THE FREEDOM TO PRETTY MUCH DO WHAT I WANT AND GO OUT AND HELP PEOPLE. AND IT'S AN AWESOME FEELING JUST GETTING OUT THERE AND TRYING TO, YOU KNOW, DO WHAT I DO. - Woman: XTREME. - AN XTREME JUSTICE. ALRIGHTY. Dark Guardian: IF WE ALL DO A LITTLE SOMETHING, WE CAN MAKE THIS PLACE BETTER, YOU KNOW, THERE'S A HERO IN EVERYBODY. AND WE JUST NEED TO START LETTING IT OUT. Life: IF WE CAN GET REAL-LIFE SUPERHEROES IN EVERY CITY IN AMERICA, I THINK THAT WOULD BE AN AMAZING THING. Zimmer: WE'RE NOT A FAD THAT'S GOING TO GO AWAY. THERE MAY NOT BE THAT MANY OF US. WE MAY NOT BE THE BEST AND THE BRIGHTEST, BUT WE DO WHAT WE CAN TO DO WHAT WE CARE ABOUT. Super Hero: IF EVERYBODY DOES ONE LITTLE BIT TO THEIR CORNER OF THE WORLD, LIKE RIPPLES IN A POND, THINGS WILL SPREAD OUT, AND THINGS CAN BE MADE BETTER. Mr. Xtreme: MORE PEOPLE SIMPLY NEED TO GET INVOLVED SO WE CAN REALLY, TRULY MAKE AN IMPACT OUT THERE. IT'S NOT THE COSTUME THAT MAKES YOU A SUPERHERO. IT'S WHAT'S IN YOUR HEART AND WHAT YOU DO. THAT'S WHAT MAKES YOU A REAL-LIFE SUPERHERO. ( music playing ) WHEN THEY FINALLY COME TO DESTROY THE EARTH  THEY'LL HAVE TO GO THROUGH YOU FIRST  I BET THEY WON'T BE EXPECTING THAT  WHEN THEY FINALLY COME TO DESTROY THE EARTH  THEY'LL HAVE TO DEAL WITH YOU FIRST  AND NOW MY MONEY SAYS THEY WON'T KNOW ABOUT  THE 1000-FAHRENHEIT  HOT METAL LIGHTS BEHIND YOUR EYES  INVINCIBLE  Invincible, oh oh oh  YOU'RE INVINCIBLE  Invincible  OH OH, INVINCIBLE  Invincible, oh oh oh  - YOU'RE INVINCIBLE  - Invincible  - THAT CRUSHING, CRASHING, ATOM-SMASHING  - Invincible  - WHITE-HOT THING, IT'S  - Invincible  INVINCIBLE  SO PLEASE  USE YOUR POWERS  FOR GOOD  PLEASE USE YOUR POWERS  FOR GOOD  YOU'RE INVINCIBLE  Invincible, oh oh oh  OH, INVINCIBLE  Invincible  - OH, YOU'RE INVINCIBLE  - Invincible  - THAT CRUSHING, CRASHING, ATOM-SMASHING  - Invincible  - WHITE-HOT THING, IT'S  - Invincible  INVINCIBLE.
