Hmm, Poplin?|Let's see. He just came from the|penitentiary. Here we go. So he did. It's here on my flimsy. Let's see what we got here.|Some nice goodies in here? Oh, let's see.|What's this? That's Texas Gold Stamps|from the market. Gimme. Gimme. Okay, there's some more. Okay. What we got in this one? All right, Mrs. Poplin. Have|yourself a real nice visit. I think theJ.C.'s are gonna have|lemonade. I didn't come for the drinkin'. Of course you didn't. You are|permitted to display familial affection, including bodily contact, as long as|it doesn't outrage the public decency. - Does that mean we can kiss?|- If you so desire. All right, then. Oh, Lou! Ain't you somethin'? Clovis!|Ain't you somethin'? Ain't you somethin'? Clovis. Ain't you somethin'? Clovis!|Ain't you somethin'? What's the matter, honey?|Goin' shy on me? I come with the bad news|I'm leavin' you. What kind of junk|are you talkin'? We are no longer man and|wife. I'm leaving you. That's why you|brought your lunch? This don't mean nothin'.|I'm already on my way. Don't you|notice nothin'? Don't you|notice anything? You've gone blonde.|You've gone blonde before. Clovis Poplin, have you|forgotten your own son? Hey! No, I ain't.|Why didn't you bring him? There's kids allowed. They|got candy for 'em and pop. I'm not behind bars in despair.|You can bring him every week. That's what I come|to tell ya. Welfare's come and taken|Baby Langston forever. They're gonna keep him|in that foster home! Why are they doin' that?|How am I supposed to know? I got out of women's|facility three weeks ago. I went to welfare|to get him back... and that child board|made up some story. They had me fill out|a statement of propriety... and take it to county|courthouse, but it was closed. A man on the first floor said to me I|should take it to the hall of records. I did, but nobody knew|what I was talkin' about. I remembered what you said|about the telephone. I called the man|and got him on the line. That didn't do no good|neither 'cause he said... the man at the first place should've|already sent it to my address. That didn't do no good|'cause I'd already moved. I want|my baby back. You gonna help me|or not? Where's he now? Over in Sugarland. Now that they got him,|I bet those Methodists... are gettin' ready to|move out of state. I wanna know if|you're gonna help. Well, sure I am.|Sure I am. Sure I am. Two for us and half-fare|for Baby Langston. I spent $65. We're goin' to Los Angeles|so's you can go white collar. Bus tickets! A workin'|father's what that boy needs! Lou Jean,|who ever gave you $65? I got to go|to the bathroom. Lou Jean?|Lou Jean? Honey, you gotta go next door.|This is the men's room! Prove it. You saved $65|all on your own? Oh, Clovis. Oh, Lord,|how I've missed you. I can't wait|no longer. You waited a year. Can't|you wait another four months? I can't.|This is an emergency. Isn't this my shirt? When I|leave today you're comin' with me. Shoot! You got two pairs of pants on! I know. I got it all planned out.|You're leavin' today. Mmm, I love you. I can't.|I only got four more months. No, you're|leavin' today. I can't. I love you. Yes, you are. I love you too.|You're leavin' today. I can't. Yes, baby. Please. I can't. Come today. Today. I love you.|No! If you don't, this is|our last time. Clovis? Jesus Christ,|have you lost your brains? Hubie, you're gonna|screw me up. Nobody breaks out of|prerelease! That's just stupid! If I don't,|she's gonna run off. You said your ol' lady|was in the jute mill. No, she's done her time|and she's out on her own. I'm gonna call a guard|for your own good. This is stupid! Hubie! Hubie! You don't understand. They|took my boy, Baby Langston. What the hell you|talkin' about, boy? Guard! Mmm. Ain't nobody gonna fuss|over four little ol' months. Bye, honey. We won't see him for another|week. Sure am gonna miss him. You might, but I'm not|gonna miss him any. Oh, Pa, don't|talk like that.! Scoot on in, Mama. Pardon me. You Hubie's mom? Yes, I am. And still proud of it no matter|what his circumstances may be now. He's a caution, which is why we|came to see him, isn't it? Sure am. Where y'all headed?|New Frankfurt. That's where we're goin'! We lost|our ride. Do you mind awfully? You're a friend of Hubie's? Sure am. That's right. That|boy ain't no damn good. Never was no good.|Stop talkin' like that! I don't think he ever will be. I tried|my best to make a man out of him... but it look like|I failed somewhere. Scoot in the seat|back there. ndale, ndale,|young fella. Yes, sir. No smokin'. Officer, I think|you're a mean man. Buster, haven't I seen you|somewhere before? You probably have. I picked peas with you on|the pea farm one time... No. Before you got that|hog leg on. No, I think I drove you|in before. I sure do. I think I took you in D.W.I.|Before. Ah, you never done. I never was drunk|in my life. What? I never was drunk in my life! What are you tryin' to do,|make a liar out of me? You son of a bitch.! You ever do|some time in prison, son? Sir?|You heard me. Well, just a little.|Yes, I did. It's all right by me. You served|your time and squared yourself. What was it you|went up for? I think they said it|was larceny. - Is this car runnin' right?|- She run pretty-pr-pretty nice. You look like a pea picker to me anyway. To tell you the truth, you|look like a pea picker to me. Is your name Buster Daniels?|It was 'fore I married. - What kind of larceny?|- We was bustin' coin boxes in the washaterias. It's hot. Do you think we could|go faster so's to cool the car? As long as you squared|yourself, it's all right by me. - Yes, sir.|- That all right with you, Mama? - Pa, you've bought it.|- I can see it. You got yourself|a real violator, huh? You ain't gonna be sick in|the car, are you? Why, no! You know I'm not, man. Good. Don't let me find that|seat wet, neither. Thank you, sir. Mr. Nocker, sir, you were goin' less than 25|miles an hour on the open highway. Not only is that|a violation... but you could be|a dangerous hazard. I'm just amused. I've been an upright,|irresponsible citizen all my life! I've been drivin'|all my life. I'm not gonna|cite you, sir, but I am gonna give you|a written warnin'. That'll be okay,|just fine. I'd like to take a look|at your safety sticker. It's plastered on the|inside of that windshield. Didn't I tell you, Pa?|He's comin' over. I gotta get out, give|myself up. No, it's too late! They're gonna be mad. I'm|gonna get another year. You willin' to go to the|end? What you talkin' about? Do you love me? Baby,|we're in real trouble! Oh, shit!|Our car's stole. You folks stay put. No, no, no.|Uh-uh. Okay, let me drive.|Lou Jean, let me drive! - 23-11, Houston.|- Go ahead. Got a 10-80 headin' west.|I'm just an old farm boy. I haven't done anything wrong.|Green Buick, 1956 license. Boy, Ocean, William,|four, zero, four. Let me drive, right now!|Let me drive! Let me out of here.|I'll walk to jail! Please let me|out ofhere. Lou, watch it! - Keep to the right!|- Hey, Officer. Do you know it's illegal to make a|turn in the middle of the highway? You violated the law. - Jesus!|- Hey! Keep to the right|of the truck. Keep to the right...|Open your eyes! Open your eyes.!|Goddamn it.! God bless me, my wife, my son,|John, his wife, plus four... God bless me, my Lord. Oh, my Lord,|my Lord. 23-11, Houston.|Houston, 23-11. Okay. Pursued vehicle done|10-50 major. Wrecked in woods. Need ambulance and wrecker|on Airline Road... three miles north|of 90. Ten-four,|23-11 received, 65-80. Just shut up and|sit where you are. Relax for now.|I'm all here. Lady? Lady? Help me out of here. Can you move your|toes and fingers? Am I bleedin'? Do you have double vision? I don't know. Does it hurt when...|All right. You let me know if it|hurts and I'll stop. There.|Okay? I never|shot a man. Friend, want to|give that back? You got no idea|what's gonna happen to you. What do we do now? I don't know. If you don't give that back voluntarily, you've committed|a felony. Now, all right. Now, stick 'em...|Reach for your... Get... Just get your goddamn hands in the air! I never gave you|no lip. Get on out of here! God bless you! Now stop.|Stop! Now get in that car. Now, you listen,|Mister. So far, it's|grand theft auto, speedin', drivin' to endanger. You've got|resistin' arrest, threatenin'|an officer, hinderin' an officer in|the performance of duty, illegal possession of|firearms and assault. But if I get in that car, you|got kidnappin', and that's fed... Lou Jean, get in|the backseat. C'mon, c'mon. Move it or loose it.|Shit! Turn them lights off! All right, now.|Let's go. That's better.

Take 59 through Rosenberg,|where the intersection y's off. 98 goes to the left. I'm in big trouble. I don't care if|I live or die. You drive or I'll shoot you!|Shut up! Then we go|into Rodrigo. That's where that bus broke|down. We're almost there. Then into Honda, Sugarland,|and the Rio Grande. We're in real trouble. Everything's gonna be fine.|Just get down. Attention ambulance|and wreckers. I was rollin' with a|patrolman when the call came. I was here from the start.|You fellas flip for it. Ernest, now I have|seen it all. Looks like 23-11 's|in the ambulance business. What's your trouble? I'm first|on the scene, got no victim. I'd say your man|owes me $40. Billy, what's happening? How ya doin'? We don't know where they|are but we know who they are. What you got? Alvin T. Nocker,|R.F.D. 4, New Frankfurt. Can I have this? Yes.|Guess get on the horn. Good idea. I figure this|has been here all day. Motor's still warm. Over to Dallas. 23-22, Houston.|Houston. 23-22, go ahead. You got any word|on what hospital... 23-11 is transportin'|his 10-50s to? We have a 10-50, no confirmation.|Are you on the scene? Yeah, I'm here, Lamar. Call the hospitals, will ya,|and see if he's on his way. I'm gonna check out the area|north and south. Ten-four. Every time we start somewhere,|you pick something to fuss about. I wish you'd hush, Pa.|I'm tired of listenin' to you. My feet hurt and I'm|tired of standin' here. You can sit and rest your|feet. What'll I sit on? You think I'm gonna|sit on this bag? Sit on your pits and|lean back on your thumb. What's the story? The missus and I|just had our car taken by an ex-con. Claimed he was a workin'|man. Was it a green Buick? Seafoam green, 1956. Stole!|Roadmaster, B-O-W 404. Is your name Alvin T. Nocker|of New Frankfurt? Yes, sir. Now you're talkin'.|You stay put. 23-11, this is Houston. 23-11,|this is Houston. 23-11, this is Houston.|Give me a ten-four. You got a|confirmation for me? 23-11, this is Houston.|23-11. - Houston, Pierce.|- This is Pierce. Go ahead. - Pierce, would you attempt|to raise 23-11? - Ten-four. I'm gonna smash|that radio. Wait! I'd rather you held back|on that. They'll dock my pay. Kick it, Clo.|I hate that goddamn thing. Please, don't smash my|radio. I can shut it off. Turn that sucker off! All|right. I'm shuttin' it off. 23-11, Airline Road,|three miles north... Just lay back.|We're not gonna hurt you. Get us to Sugarland.|Everything'll be fine. Shit! You get outta here! On the day|in question, how long had your man been|with the highway patrol? It was three years,|unless I'm mistaken. During that three years, had it|ever come to your attention that... he was having difficulty|with his vision? No, sir. Don't highway patrolmen|have to have regular... physical examinations and|examinations of your eyes? Yes, sir, all highway|patrol personnel... undergo a thorough|medical examination. Excuse me a moment, gentlemen. Captain Tanner.|Yes, sir. If you would,|Your Honor. We have an emergency. May|I see counsel in chambers? We stand adjourned. All rise.! Your Honor, may I have|the court's attention? May it please the court... Your Honor? 2-5-9-0, Houston.|This is Capt. Tanner. Believe our man is hijacked.|Repeat, hijacked. Have all units makin' the florist call stay|off the "A" channel as much as possible. There's no need them knowin'|what we're talkin' about. I want a roadblock on 90 Alternate|at the Lavaca County line. The name of the patrolman|is Maxwell Slide. He's been in uniform nine months|but he's a good boy. We can't count on him to|act in his own best interest. In the event of a face-off, I|want you to keep your shirts on. I see lights.|A whole bunch! Put that shotgun on this officer|so's he knows where you're at. That's my captain. Don't shoot.! That's Captain Tanner.|You want to get us all killed? I'll put you|on the radio. Tell him to get out ofhere.|We never hurt nobody.! 23-11, 25-90. Go ahead,|23-11. We got a 10-32 in here.|Says drop off or he'll shoot. They hurt you any,|Maxwell? I'm sorry about this. I|had no idea they were 96s. What you talkin', 32, 96?|You tryin' to code me out? No, sir, it is merely|verbal shorthand. 10-32 is a man with a gun.|10-96 is your mental subject. How do you work this thing? When|you wish to talk, press the button. We ain't no|mental subjects. I've done some dumb things,|but I ain't a goddman mental subject! What's your name, son? My name's Clovis Poplin and|this is my ol' lady, Lou Jean. What are you doin'|with our man in there? He's takin' us to Sugarland|to get my boy, Langston. You got a strange notion|on how to hitchhike. Y'all stay back,|no need to worry. Get your cars back.|Quit followin' us! I've got|a job to do. I can't have ol' boys|commandeerin' my patrol car. What would|the taxpayers say? Get back or I'll|shoot 'em in the head. Take it easy and think|about what you're doin'. No one's gonna get hurt. Do you hear me? We'll get you|out of this, Maxwell. We've got|a bad hombre here. We're gonna have to|lift that roadblock. Houston, let 'em all know to|back off and let that boy through. Here they come. Get|that car out of the hole! Hit it, boys!|Hit it! Sam, I couldn't see|a damn thing! We'd better|phone it in. Doggie.! Doggie.!|Doggie.! Doggie.! Oh!|Here, doggie. Doggie, want more? Baby?|Baby Langston? Let's go inside and play. Mommy. Mommy. Mommy, Mommy! You're lyin'!|I'm awful sorry, sir. You had the whole thing|planned, you're mistaken. From beginning to end.|I sure as hell never. Don't tell me. I can see|you had a plan! You're wrong. You get us goin'! Ma'am, we're|out of gas. There's no fillin' station|anywhere nears here. Just surrender yourselves.|This thing'll end peaceable. Capt. Tanner?|Capt. Tanner? You're on|the outside speaker. Capt. Tanner,|this is Clovis Poplin. I wanna talk to you. Look, they give Gold Stamps.|I want some Gold Stamps. Lou Jean, you|don't need no stamps. Fill 'er up?|Ethyl. That oil|needs checkin'. Honey? Honey? What? If you wanna run do somethin',|now'll be the time. Not me. I know you. Run and do what you have to. I don't|have anything to do! Shall we go,|if you please? All right. How y'all today? You want me to|check that oil? Oil's okay. Tell him I want|Gold Stamps... lots. He's comin'.|Be quiet. That'll be 7.90,|please, sir. What in the world is|going on around here? I'm sorry, we can't accept these|here. Better talk to the captain. Talk to who?|The captain? Wait.! Come back here.! Ho!|Ho! Hold it, hold it!|Hold on just a minute! This ain't no|contract station. We can't accept your|card. Talk to the captain. Are you the captain? We can't accept|them credit cards here. Hey, are you a captain? If you|ain't, would you tell me where he is? Your name, sir.|Oh, ah, Fr... Fred Mengers. I own this station|right here. Do you know you just served|gas to an escaped felon? Oh, you mean in that|police car? Yes, sir. I sure did,|yes, sir. I'm from right here|in Killdeer. And I seen|the whole thing happen. There. The fugitives|have been identified... as Clovis Michael Poplin,|25, a convict from Crowley, and Lou Jean Sparrow Poplin, 25,|an unemployed beautician from Sayers. The name of the patrolman|has not been released... pending notification|of next ofkin. The hijackers stated to Captain|Tanner that their purpose... was to protest the action|of the Child Welfare Board, which refused to return custody|of their son to Mrs. Poplin, who has|a criminal record. The boy has been living with|foster parents in Sugarland. The K.K.O.K. Mobile command unit|is on its way for a live report. This has been a K.K.O.K.|News KO. This is the big country.|It's great country. But sometimes it can get|mighty hot and dry. Out here, men grow|the mightiest thirsts on Earth. It takes a lot|to cut it. That's why Lone Star|is one of the... What they're saying is|I'm an unfit mother. - You broke out of prerelease?|- Shut up. Mind your own business! You broke your husband|out of prerelease? You're assuming a lot|for a man your size. What was that "unemployed beautician"?|You been takin' money from Donny Hyatt? No, I quit.|You got $65. You ain't never seen work.|What you been doin'? You been runnin'around? I|have not! I am not lyin'! - Don't lie to me!|- Don't call me no liar! Donny Hyatt ain't runnin'|around. That's just beerin'. Suspicions of marital infidelity|are more often than not groundless. The disputes ensuin' are highly|destructive. What do you know? Why'd you have to come along for|anyway? This whole thing's your fault. Now, lady...|It's your fault! If you were half as|good-lookin' as Donny Hyatt... I still wouldn't quit|no job for you, not after this mess|you got me in. I've stopped more disputes than|you've had. I've been trained for it. Mind your own|goddamn business. What you wanna hang around Donny Hyatt|and Bill Fails for? They're just... Jean, they're gonna call you|promiscuous, unfit. In the three years we've been|married, I haven't even had the urge. And I am not promiscuous|and I am not unfit, neither! Pull over. I wanna talk to that man. You heard it on... # Great country 68 # Well,|I'll be doggone. The highway patrol in our|neighboring state of Texas... admitted|early this afternoon... that their roadblock|has been licked. Your news hounds have learned|that the hijackers... Admire it|while you got it. Next time around it's|propane and super slow. Equipped to give officers|a run for their money. Inasmuch as Texas patrol vehicles,|like our state of Louisiana, boast high-performance engine... Pete, these things|ready to roll? They're ready when you are.|You been followin' the fun? Texas highway patrol's got|their hijacker on the radio. - The hell you say.|- It's no lie! I believe they gonna|talk him out of it. Where'd they be|about this time? Outside of Killdeer, Texas, goin' west. What say we just|poke on up there? That's over|three hours away. Just about|the break-in period. Nod Away standard crib,|four positions, teething rail, 16 and a quarter books. Honey,|we could get that. And Happy Hoppers. Push toy|encourages walkin' activity. Colored disks makes|poppin'S.N.D. What does that mean? And we got, uh, animal shop crib mobile,|one and a quarter books. And, uh, Nod Away play yard,|one book. We've got...|Honey? Honey? I got somethin'|to tell ya. Promise you won't|be mad? Honey? I got to go|pee-pee. All-around bumper pad,|one and a half books. Honey? Honey!|I gotta pee! Shit! We gotta have ourselves|a little talk. We gotta quit this runnin'|around and start runnin'. You want me to pee in|the backseat of that car? All this stoppin', startin'. We|ain't never gonna get Langston. Everything's|gonna be fine. Just fine. We're in real trouble. Lou Jean Poplin|has two shopliftings, and a conviction on petty larceny,|for which she did eight months. Clovis Poplin|has four petty larcenies, two illegal entries|and a conviction on burglary. He has four months left|on a one-year sentence. You sure there's no armed|robbery or assault? No, sir. Did they ever make use|of firearms? Sure didn't. Ah, shoot! They're nothin'|but a couple of kids. Hold it! You! You in|the cab there! Unhook that thing.|Get out of here. Sit down!|Sit down! Come on! Gonna drive away|with her pants down? That's a nice try.|You're not dealing with a blind man. Turn around and sit down!|Sit down! Hold it! Hold it! Now, I just might see what happens... if I shoot a load of|buckshot in that commode. I said, I just might see what happens... if I put another hole|in that thing.! It's only me. You gonna let him|get away with that, Captain? Well, I don't know. They thought their way|out of a toilet. This ol' boy's|some doer. They sure are messin'|all over us, I know that. You got any better ideas? Yes, sir. I sure in hell do. Hello.|Hello, ma'am. Of course, I know|why you're here... but I have|nothing to say. We'd just like to|see the child, Mrs. Looby. Well,|the child board says... the child is ours|to keep now... and we love him|very much. And I'm his mother.|We understand that. How old is|the little boy? Oh, he was two|in January. We sure would like|to interview him. Oh, uh... Uh, Verne? Verne? No. Langston, do you know|where your papa is? Could you wave good-bye|to your real mama? Are you happy? He's our boy now,|we give him a good home, and he has all the love|he'll ever need. Right here.|All the love, Baby Langston. Oh, no, no, baby. Back!|Back up! Get closer to the thing.|I can't reach over there. Now, move over here. Get closer.|I can't reach it. All right, stop! We're the Poplins. Anybody home? Captain?|Yeah. This is Mark Fenno. Hi, Captain. That's Logan Waters. Howdy, Captain. They're rangers. They think|they can drop that ol' boy. What've|you got there? I got a 7 millimeter Magnum,|4- power scope, Mauser action. I'll be shootin'|a 148-grain bullet. At 300 yards,|hit a dime. Can you guarantee|Slide won't be hit? At this distance?|Oh, absolutely. How am I gonna know|they'll be killed outright? If it's a spasm shot|you're worried about, I figure to hit the boy in|the brain and cut his motors. What about the girl? Same thing. She'll be dead|before the sound gets there. You don't|want none? Well, maybe|just one piece. A small piece.|I'm not that hungry. Give the man a breast, Lou. Clovis! Could I have|more honey, please? Honey?|Huh? Want another napkin? I just|wanna tell you I love you. Don't say it|too loud. Hey, he's got|a wishbone! C'mon, Lou. C'mon.|Okay. I won.|The kid. I don't know. I can't tell|the boy from a doorpost. We've lost|our light. How you gonna score|through that glass? Captain, the glass|will be no problem. Don't put that stuff|on me. Give me a number. I'd say it's|better than 90%. I'm gonna have to|say "no" to you boys. That's a|pretty good number. We won't get chances as good as|this one. It's not good enough. It's a long ways|from here to Sugarland. There's possibles that|we haven't tried yet. I've been on the force 18 years. It's been my good fortune not to|have killed anyone in that time. That's the way|I'd like to keep it. Wouldn't you know it. How do you like it? Got a flat spot|between 85 and 90. Not me. - How far to Binney?|- About five or 10 minutes. We didn't pass|that cutoff, did we? I don't think so. # Oh, Louisiana gals|Come and listen to my noise # # Don't ever marry them|Texican boys # How about tellin' me|what you got in mind? Hold your butter. I'm gonna|76 'em like you never saw. That's a great idea,|just terrific! That's great! Think you|can do it without me? You know my mind|on the matter. You ought to by now. If your butt ain't sore, I|don't mind tellin'you mine is.! Aren't you tired? No, I ain't. I don't see why we can't|reach some understanding. Do you trust me? I'm not saying I do|and I'm not saying I don't. You talkin' about|not charging me? That I can't do, but what I can|do is make it easier on Ms. Poplin. If she's worried|about her baby, I personally can arrange a hearing|with the Department of Public Welfare... so she can tell|her side of the story. I appreciate that,|Captain. You're a man of your word and you're|tryin'your best. Don't think I don't see that. But we got|other plans. What are your other|plans? I'd like to know. We got secret plans. Look out! Keep after 'em!|C'mon! Hubert, get after them! Pull over! What's in the road? Can you advise|if you can release units? We need some|back at home. You crazy son of a bitch!|You tried to rack us up! I goddamn|sure as hell didn't! I been to drivin' school.|The proof is you're livin' and squawkin'. They're gonna be|so mad. I don't care. Gimme gum|and I'll drive all night. - Don't stop for nothin'.|- Don't call me no son of a bitch! Clovis, it don't do no good|runnin' from a tornado. Who else is out there? The|Lord only knows, Captain. Call 'em all in. All except|Highway patrol out of Region 2. If I can't call him by his first|name, I don't want him out there. Yes, sir.|I want a helicopter. A helicopter|with a searchlight. And I want some kind of a spot|to hem these ol' boys up. C'mon. Move on down here. That's it.|C'mon, c'mon. That's it.|Good. Real fine. Where the hell|they all comin' from? We heard anything|from our unit? No, sir. They are still out there? Yes, sir. In fact, the whole state|ofTexas is on A.P.B. Alert. The whole state|ofTexas is here! We got lawmen from|Dallas, up from Austin. If they was all dentists, we|could call this a damn convention. Has the chopper come up|with anything yet? Nothin'. Just kids hole-punchin'|back of the schoolyard. Have you located|this ol' boy's folks? Both mother|and father dead. Do we know the girl's|maiden name? Sparrow. Hey, help.! Hey, help.! Clovis Poplin.! Somebody help me.! Help! I don't believe it! Man, these cuffs hurt! Are you|Mr. Sparrow? This way. That's some ride,|huh? Mr. Sparrow, your influence|might persuade... your daughter and her husband|to give themselves up. Otherwise, I fear not only|for the safety of our men, but frankly,|for their lives as well. Do you understand why I|have to say that? Yes, sir. All right, sir, whenever you're ready, you just|press this black button down here. Talk in a|normal tone of voice. When you're ready,|just... talk in a|normal tone of voice. Yes, and press...|Press this button, and talk in a normal tone|of voice. That's right. You want me to go ahead? Just|say whatever you think's right. Lou Jean?|Lou Jean! Lou Jean.! This is your daddy. They brought|me down in a helicopter... that I might say a word,|and I'm gonna. It's a good thing your|poor mother is not alive... to see what has|become of you. Lou Jean,|you're no good.! And I always knew... If this man gave me a gun,|I'd go there and shoot you... and shoot that|trash you married. God'll get you. Hi, there. Here, take this. Put this around ya.|It'll make you feel better. You tired? I sure am. Not every day you hitch|a ride like this. You're not all together|bad-lookin'. You married?|No. - Got a girl?|- Of course I do. I bet she's nice. Well, good night. Lou Jean? Yeah? Could you turn off|the police radio? Why, sure.|Great. Lou Jean?|Yeah? I know you're|all right... and a good woman|at heart, even though you might have|took a wrong turn in life. Well, thank you,|I'm sure. Prison made|a woman out of me. Good night. Jean? It's got a gas stove. Goddamn! Hey, we got|a free movie next door. Oh, Lou, honey. If Baby Langston was here,|we'd be a real family. What if we|don't get the baby? Of course we're|gonna get him! That's why you stole|that ol' police car, ain't it? I guess it is.|You guess it is? I guess you're right. Come here. Did you miss me?|Every day. I like to hear you|tell me that. I missed|all that sweet talk. I wish we|could get drunk. We always used to|get drunk together. You're fun drunk. Except when you're throwin' up in|the back of Bill Fails's Chevelle. Jean, I mean that|for what it is. You're my wife|and I love you... even if we|don't get the baby. Wish we had sound. I'll be your sound.|C'mon. Beep, beep! Beoosh-osh-osh! Uh-uh-uh-uh! Sss-sss-sss. Beep-beep!|Beep-beep! Oh, no.! Oh, boy, that kid! How many times|have I told him! What are you doin'|in that outfit? We're not goin'|to the mountains. Just a precaution.|See and be seen. There's gonna be a lot of clowns out|there with firearms and itchy fingers. I don't want|to get shot. Patty, you tryin' to be a|reserve officer like your ol' man? No, I want it full time. You'll make it. Did you bring the coffee? Black and hot. Great. Did you do that? I had to. You're in|real trouble. Thank you. Jean, you decent? Propane.|Nice. Y'all decent? I'm gonna go pick one out and|don't you guys get to dawdlin'. Does that ol' razor|belong to you? Sure do.|Wanna use it? Yeah,|when you're done. How much money you make|on the highway patrol? Not a whole lot,|lemme tell ya. How much is that? 620 a month. But I take home|a whole lot less. I didn't mean|what I said. What was that? About callin'you a son of|a bitch. I didn't mean that. And you ain't no|mental subject, neither. I've been thinkin' about|gettin' on the highway patrol. They won't take|a man with a record. I think it's|a state law. Honey, I found us... Blue colored.|I love it.! Honey.! Just supposing|that I were to tell you... that this is|the end of the line. Just supposin' I told you|I wasn't gonna go no further. What? Just supposin'! Now, you may kill me, but if you don't come to|your senses and throw it down, they're gonna kill you. Well, supposin' I was|worried about that? Which I'm not! And supposin' I was|to give myself up, how many years you figure|they'd give me for breakin' out? I couldn't tell you but it might go|real easy bein' you're a regular fella. Well, I am a regular|fella! I never shot a man. There you go! That's a|major point with the law. Make you mighty happy,|I bet ya. Hell, yes.|It'd make everybody happy! Where are you two?|It's already sunup. Not Lou Jean,|it wouldn't make her happy. Man, they'd lock me up|from now to Moses. Take away my boy for good.|They'll change his name. All right,|stand up. Stand up! Nobody move.|I made up my mind. We're gonna take this one.|It's the best on the lot. Don't let that|squelch fool you. We're not the|only ones out here. Maybe they already caught 'em. No way. I had my home set on all night.|Wasn't anything on A.P.B. About it. You all know what I think|about the airborne. Dad, they're in|Big John's! After you get the|insulation scraped off, you bring it from your hot|line to your coil over here. Make sure you don't get|your fingers on the metal. I need somethin' to|short over to the starter. What about your badge?|Yeah, that'll work. You got water|in the gas line. Y'all been runnin' lights|and appliances all night? No.|Yeah! Battery's outside. Which one do you want?|I'll take that redhead. Down!|Down! Come back! There! There! Come back! Come back here! Come back here! That must be them,|all right. Aaah! Hold it!|Maxwell, come back! Wait.! Max.! Wait a minute!|You son of a bitch! Make 'em stop.! Stop!|Hold your fire! This is patrolman Slide, Texas|Department of Public Safety. How do you work|this goddamn thing? No, Lou Jean,|turn it around.! Capt. Tanner.!|Capt. Tanner.! They're shootin'at us. This is Capt. Tanner.|Where you located? We got 'em. Big John's|Used Car Lot, Military Drive. Hey, we got 'em. They're at Big|John's, Military and San Pedro. Get anything yet? Boy, wait'll they see|what we found. Drop those weapons! Move a|finger and I'll blow it off. But we've captured|the fugitives. - Keep 'em here, Jessup.|- Yes, sir. Capt. Tanner.! Capt. Tanner.!|Capt. Tanner.! You're gonna kill|your man. I'll pull my trigger.|I'm gonna shoot his head. It's him or my baby,|that's my deal. Clovis, I see you.|That's my deal. What kind of a deal|are you talkin' about? We keep right on|to Sugarland, no roadblocks, and no|snipers and no nothin'.! Once we get my baby,|I'll let your man go. Are you listenin'? 'Cause|he's gonna tell you somethin'. This is patrolman|Maxwell Slide. I suppose y'all might want|to end it right here now. If that's your thinkin',|sir, it's fine by me. Y'all come on in.|Tell everyone I told you that. Let's all back off|a step or two, men. There's no need for|hasty talk around here. All right, Clovis.|You got yourself a deal. Sounds like a fair proposition|to me and I'm gonna abide by it. But no more runnin' off, no|more speedin', and no more guns. What do you say to that? I|want your personal word ofhonor. Do I got it? Yeah, you got it. Did you hear that, honey?|We're gonna get the baby. Capt. Tanner, I do believe|you're a good man. Captain? Yeah? You ain't really gonna let|them take that baby, are you? I don't see|how we can. Well, uh, do you want me|to go somewheres? Yeah. Go find those two ol' boys|that was with you. What's their names? Fenno and Waters. Yeah, Fenno|and Waters. Find them, take the chopper,|and get over to the foster home. Yes, sir. I'm real sorry,|Captain. Yeah. Don't let me see you|around here again. But, Captain...|Shut up! These boys|ain't no reserves. They ain't been on the active|list for more than a year. Is that right? 9- 3-4-1. Take that|with you! - Arrest them, Jessup.|- Yes, sir! You're not gonna take him|away, are you? No, ma'am. Just gonna make sure|he'll be safe, that's all. # When the blue moon|turns to gold again # #And the rainfall|turns the clouds away # #When my blue moon|turns to gold again # # I'll be back|within your arms to stay # I'm settin' too far|from the wheel. No, sir, that's the way|it's supposed to be. Place your hands at|10:00 and 2:00. Like this?|That's about okay. When negotiatin' a turn, shuffle|the wheel through your fingers... rather than to go across,|hand-over-hand. That way you got both hands|on the wheel at all times. # I'll be back #|That's neat. #Within your arms again ## Have you ever seen|a picture of Baby Langston? Ain't he sweet? Yeah, fine-lookin' boy. I took that picture. It's|a fine-lookin' picture. This here's my ma and pa,|Horace and Mavorene Slide. Hey, you got|your pa's eyes. Who they standin' next to?|My bull. I was in the F.F.A. Who's that,|your girlfriend? That's my old girlfriend.|I still got the cycle. Hmm. What's that? No, no. Gimme that! Ah! What's that? That's mine. Is that you?|Is that you? Yeah.|Ahhh! Looks just like you. I bet you're gonna get a big|promotion when this thing's over. You're gonna be|Lieutenant Slide. That'll be the day. Hey, looky up there! What do you think|of that? Could I have that? Would|you bring that here to me? You got to|count to 10. 1- 2-3-4-5|6- 7-8-9-10. Oooh, God! Lemme see.|Nah-uh. Could you do me a|favor? Anything you want. Could you get me some hair|spray and a set of rollers? You wait right here.|Just wait right here. Could you bring some pins|and some other junk? - You just wait.|- And lipstick, pink frosted? You wait now. Here you go. Maxwell Slide.|There's my picture. That's an old mug shot|of me. I look like shit. You look more like a convict. It's|Patrol Academy. It's worse than jail. It's your baby. Don't let no|one take him away from you. I'm not gonna. Thank you for everything|you've done. I appreciate it. Y'all take care now. Bye!|Bye! There's another town|between here and Sugarland. I don't want any more|rubberneckin'. You go around to Rodrigo and make sure|the local man's got the streets cleared. If he tells you it's the 4th|ofJuly, you advise him otherwise. Do you understand? All right. Yes, sir. Wanna set up some sandbags? We won't need 'em. We're gonna need|more room in here. Get that chair out|just a little bit. Can you gimme|some braces? Ma'am, are you expecting|a delivery of diapers, milk, or newspapers, anything like that? No. Are there any|neighbors or kinfolk... who might get it into their|minds to pay a visit? No. Excuse me, ma'am. You all right, sir? Officer, I know you're not gonna|let me shoot the son of a bitch, but at least|you could use my rifle. I don't know how|this is gonna look. You should always|wash it first. Christ! How y'all doin'?|Could I ask y'all some questions? Hey,|y'all be careful. How they treatin' you, Mr.|Slide? They've been all right. When you gonna|make your escape? I'm not gonna escape. I'm too|busy talking the man out of it. He's talkin', see,|but I ain't listenin'. The hell you ain't! I've|practically got him rehabilitated. I wouldn't go that far.|I'm just being reasonable. You in the rig. You've got one second|to get out of there. I wanna say I appreciate what|Capt. Tanner's done on my behalf. What would you two charge for an|exclusive interview with my station? Cash money? Don't nobody|want to ask me nothin'? Okay. Now,|we're not gonna talk... to any more reporters and such|until we decide on our deal. Right. Whatever you think's fair. Okay. I've been advised... we've got innocent civilians|all over the streets of Rodrigo. I can't let you|go on in. I want you to pull over and stop so's|we don't have an accident or worse. Pull over and stand while I|find a way around that town. What's he thinkin' of?|So what if there's people? I wanna see the people!|I like the people.

Could you sign somethin'|real nice right there? Listen,|this here's my card. Maxwell Slide,|phone and address. I sure would like my|car back after all this. Honey, c'mon.|Let's go. Well, Captain, looks like|we made it in one piece. Looks that way, son. You still want|your baby? You still want|your patrolman? Listen to me, Clovis.|We come a long way together, and you know my intentions have|never been other than decent. Whether you|realize it or not, I know|what's best for you. I'm asking you, please get out|of that car and get into mine. Let me take you home. I know I gave you|my word and all, but I'm still a duly constituted|peace officer of the State of Texas. What he's saying is he might|not be able to keep his word. I'm happy with|the deal we made. All right. Your child, Langston Poplin, is in the foster home|ofhis foster parents. You just|go on over there... and they'll|give him to you. Tell him I know where|it is.! Let's go.! Hold on a minute. We gotta|get somethin' straight. Go ahead. I want 15 minutes while|I go in and get my boy. You got it. I wanna go in private. Y'all hang|right back here. All right,|we're not movin'. I'll just park here|so no one gets by me. That's real fine.

We're only a few miles from Mexico.|Jean's got a cousin in Mexico City. We're gonna go down|and live with her. There it is.!|There it is.! Yeah, I see it. I see it.|Don't stop! Hey, that was it!|What are you doin'? That was it,|do you hear me? Stop that car! It's all wrong. Look|around you, for Chrissake. You heard what|the captain said. I'm beggin' ya. Hand me back my gun and in|the name of God, let's quit. Open your door and|you step out real easy, and we'll go get|my boy. Clovis, he's not in there. Ain't no way in the world|I'm goin' up that path. Oh, God. It's true. He ain't in there. Baby Langston!|Baby Langston! Now, get outta here. Baby Langston! Baby Langston! They took him away.|I hear him. Sit down.|Just sit down.! Jean, they took him away.|What's the matter with you? Get out there!|You go get him! You lied to me. Go get|him! I can't do that!
