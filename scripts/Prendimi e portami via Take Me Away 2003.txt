I'm good in every subject, we can do our homework together. I'm good in Geography too. I know all the capitals. Know the capital of the Philippines? It's Quezon City. You are smart. Will they let you come over? Yes. I gave you a discount. It's one euro instead of 1.20 for the cans. The bottles 70 cents instead of one euro. - Your total is 52 euros. - I can't. - How about 50? - All right. Give me the money now. I have an important meeting, a half hour ago! - Did they fix it? - Yes. Tony, my van isn't working right. My mechanic is an idiot. I'll pay you if you take a look at it. No money, you're a friend. Look at that van... It's the belt. It makes a funny noise. Luciana, did you hear about Othello? No, what happened? He was selling beer to the gypsies and since they're mechanics and something was wrong with his van, he asked them for help. Not only did they fix it, but they did it for free. - That was nice. - Right! They totally emptied it out! I don't know how much they got, but it was a lot! And he didn't realize it? Who, that fool? How could he, even the kids were in on it. They were showing him the engine in front while they cleaned out the back! - I don't believe it. - It's the truth. Last time he told his mother they stole his van, but he really sold it to pay off gambling debts. That's Othello for you! I know, but nobody wants those gypsies around. Italo's bar is getting signatures to kick them out. What do they do wrong? It's not what they do, it's what they are. Do you like to live over people who don't have a toilet, so they do it right in the street? Come here, I want to show you something. What? I'll show you. Sit down. These are my keepsakes from when I was a kid. This is my grandmother, she's dead now. On my mother's side. She's pretty. This is my grandfather, he fought the Germans. This is when I was just born. Okay, it's the wrong one. That's my cousin, she's older than me. She's a nurse now. Look, this is your house. And this is you looking out the window. I would see you but didn't know who you were. Wow, can I keep it? - Yes. - Write something here. - What? - Whatever you want. All right. To my friend, Romana... She's very nice. Here you are. I read your note that you were up here. She's a friend from school, we're doing homework together. Hi, what's your name? Her name's Romana. What a pretty name! Where do you live? Next door. - I can show you if you want. - Okay. So you live nearby. Is that it? I'm going to have a house someday. I have to go. - Behave and be careful. - All right. Bye. See, it's an antique. I always keep it with me, you never know... This has every place in the world in it, - even though I'll never go there. - What's here? - Nothing. - Just the sea. The sea! What? - Have you been there? - Yes. - Is it nice? - It's really nice! - Can we go there? - Sure. - Do you promise? - Yes. - Really? - Yes. What do you think, Mom? - Will it fall? - It won't. Can anyone help me? Who would that 'anyone' be? How about me? Good morning, Madame. - Well? How did it go? - Take a guess. I lost out and that's it. The Carabinieri said I can press charges against unknown suspects. But you wait, I'll make those damn gypsies pay. Alfredo, I have to ask you a favor. What favor? You need to pay me right away. Come on, don't be like that. If only Venezia had beaten Juventus, I would have got 600 euros but it didn't happen. If I could just win once, just once! You never win, Othello, never! People like us have to work for a living! We pay after 60 days. It's always been that way. Where do you get these ideas? You can't say no to a friend. I don't have the money! Look at what we've made this morning! Please, I'm in trouble and don't know what to do. You deserve it! You sell beer to those drunken gypsies! I'm a supplier, I can't decide who to sell to and who not. That's hardly what's going to ruin your business. Can you help me, I'm a refugee from Kosovo. You dirty piece of shit! - Stop that! - You creep! Leave her alone! - They'll kill you! - Get out, you animal! You know what? I'm never coming back here. Go get your beer somewhere else! - Fuck off! - You animal! Come here, sweetie. Let me see. We'll take you to the hospital, they'll clean you up. We'll put that animal behind bars! Leave me alone, don't touch me! What did I do? Forget it, she's just a gypsy. No, my van! - Where are you going? - Let me go! Come here, my little boy! Mommy, call the firemen! Don't worry, they're coming. Mrs. Romoli! Do you remember me? I'm De Angelis's mom, class 2B. De Angelis... right. I apologize for not coming to the teacher conferences. - But I've been busy. - That's why I don't remember you. I know, I'm sorry. I'll come next month, I promise. I'm working on an art exhibition, I'm a painter. But I'll start coming more, I promise. - Is your husband a painter? - No, a shopkeeper, why? I don't remember him either. I know what you're saying, but my husband and I are good parents. Well, I don't know, but we try to be. - Do you understand? - No. I mean, we may not follow him as much as we'd like, but we care about his education, we want him to continue. We want him to go to high school and university. Good luck. What does that mean? You remind me of how I used to be. My students were my own kids, maybe a little more active. I thought they'd be smart, go to university... Some might be teachers... Years went by, some ended up dead or in jail. But most ended up at the local bar doing nothing. All of them, even the brightest ones. They all had that same stupid and ordinary look on their faces. No, none of them went to university. Come on, please. We've been friends for 15 years, we've never had problems. So? Friends have disagreements sometimes. You just have to talk about it. - A coffee, please. - Two. And we worked it out, didn't we? Are you fighting about the other day? When Marisa wanted to call the cops? - What did you do? - Nothing! I just slapped a gypsy girl around. - You almost killed her! - Killed her? You can do what you want, but not in my store! That's the problem. You did a lot of damage in it. I apologized. They burnt my van, those crooks. I wish I had proof it was them. Alfredo's right, you can't cause trouble in a store. Especially a friend's store. This time those fucking gypsies got me, but all of you could be next! That's another story. See, you don't solve anything by beating them up, so you have to find another method. I know how to get rid of them. Fear, we have to scare them. Really scare them. I'd better leave. Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde! One shoots little girls, the other beats them. Wait. - Good thing you're here. - Why? There's someone who wants to buy your paintings. Who? A certain Antonini. He's a good kid. Well, kid... He must be at least forty. He's a lawyer and wants to decorate his new office. - Is it a sure thing? - Quiet! - But why mine? - Because you're good. And you can trust me. You should see how happy he is. He was so excited when he saw "The Annunciation". He said you're an amazing artist and can't wait to meet you. He's even made an offer that I consider reasonable. But you have to decide on the price. - No you decide. - Don't worry, I'll take care of it. This is your client... She is our artist. Luciana De Angelis, - nice to meet you. - My pleasure. Your paintings are wonderful. Thank you. Shall we sit down? Make yourselves comfortable. If you like her work, make a serious offer or we'll have to pass. My offer... I'll give you 4,000 euros. Half now and the rest when I can. Let's say 60 days. Plus I want widow Rampichini's oak-wood desk. All right. - No, it's not! - I need it for my computer. It's not mine. The widow left it to the parish. There's a holograph will. You'll find a way. So what about the offer? I think it's fine. If you're happy... But the paintings stay here throughout the scheduled showing. So... So it's a deal, the other half in 60 days, give or take a day. Let's just say 60 days! See you in 60 days. Thank you. It was a pleasure meeting you. - Thank you. - Good luck on your show. Thank you. Goodbye. I hope you can come. So do I. Goodbye. Interesting... Very interesting. Before he met you he had made a much lower offer. Will you wait! Listen to me, we've made up. But you and my mother haven't! She even said if you walk in there again she'll call the police and sue you. What kind of friend are you? What's the problem, just go tell her: "The store is mine and Othello supplies my drinks, so don't you dare call anyone else. " Why? First, because my mother owns the store. Second, she pays the suppliers with her checks. Third, I own nothing. Even the car is in her name. Is that enough? Fourth, because you're an idiot and fifth because I've had enough of your shit! You have? Let me tell you... - Tell me what? - You know what your problem is? You son is going out with that gypsy slut! Whatever. I'm not done with you, there's more. Go on. When we get rid of these fucking gypsies, the day will come when we remember who was on their side, who protected them, and we'll get rid of them too! Traitors! Fine, I'll pretend you didn't say that. Because you didn't say anything anyway. Just go home. Please! What if someone beat up your son? I don't know. The less I get involved, the better off I am. Anyway, Othello deserves it. Hitting a little girl, that's sick. - Maybe it wasn't even the gypsies. - Listen to you! Who's that? Who is it? Be right down. Mom, it's Romana. I'm going out. What about your dinner? I'm not hungry. All right, don't be late. Wasn't he ill today? He didn't go to school. He said he's better now. - Is he with that gypsy? - Yes. I told you that I don't want him hanging out with her. - I know. - Well? Doesn't what I say matter? Here we go again! Yes, until you start doing what I say. Where are you going? Listen to me... I get up at four every morning and work until eight at night. Have I ever complained? Have I ever said I'm tired? - Answer me! - I know what you're getting at. Wait, answer me. - Have I ever complained? - No. Why not? - How do I know? - Because you're content with it. No, I'm not. Sometimes I want to just give it all up. When that damn alarm goes off at 3:30, I'd love to smash it and go back to sleep. Do you know how often I feel that? A lot. Do you know why I don't? Because of me and Giampiero. Right. My wife and my son. I do this to give my family a nice life. You paint, Giampiero has school. One day he'll have a family. So everything is just terrible! I work to support a kid with no friends, he's always alone like a moron. And his only friend is - a gypsy girl! - Giampiero isn't a moron, he's a smart kid. If it wasn't for that shitty school... I know Giampiero isn't an idiot. But he's strange, everyone laughs at him. Especially now that he hangs out with her, they're the couple of the year. I've had enough. What am I supposed to do? Is it his fault? - Have you ever talked to him about it? - Let me talk! I want him to do what other kids do. Like what? Play ball, go to school, study... But no more being weird! We don't need weird people here, and enough with her! Enough! - You know what? - What? I should be saying "Enough". Enough of your bullshit. "Don't worry, things will get better. " I'm saying enough! Open up. - I'm losing my patience. - Go away! - Now you've really pissed me off. - Asshole. Look what you did! Don't touch me! I'll call the police! Relax, look what you did. - I'll have you arrested. - Relax, calm down. You know what? What? This is my house. It's nice. - I want to show you something. - Okay. I can see your house from this window. Every time I look out, you're always looking down here. But I'm not... I'm looking at the field. No... You're looking here because you know I'm here. - This is my mother. - Nice to meet you. This is my friend, Giampiero. We do homework together. I can tell you're a good kid. We have to go, I want to show him something. Goodbye. This is my father. I want to show you something I've never shown anyone. Whose are they? Ours. Yours too. Here, hold him. - Here. - What are they for? To eat when we get married. - Married? - Yes, you and I. Don't you want to marry me? Yes. Then we can go away together because I want to get out of here. I don't want to go to school, I don't like anyone there. I don't want to work either. What do you want to do? Be a movie actress or a soap opera book actress. It's the same thing. At least with that guy's money we can remodel the store. It's not his money, it's mine. I earned it with my paintings. I did it myself. I always knew you were a great artist. The best. I picked the best. It's gone. What's gone? Between us. Why? We've changed, for the worse. Our lives... You don't make me laugh anymore. Or even make me angry. The only feeling you bring out in me is embarrassment. The only thing I feel for you and me is pity. We're no longer happy, Alfredo. You're engaged? Yes, he's rich and he'll give me a lot of things. But he's not handsome like you. Then why are you marrying him? My father is making me to. But don't be sad. He's old and someday he'll die. When he does, I'll get all the money and marry you. This is where he lives, and this is the trailer where he's staying. He owns carnival rides so he travels the world. But Uncle Cossiglio said he's staying there now. We have to find him. Then what? We kill him in his sleep. What if someone see us? No one will. How will we kill him? - With this. - Are you crazy? When do we do it? Tomorrow, after school. Mr. Antonini. Mrs. De Angelis! - Why are you here? - I'm doing the shopping. I mean, you should do it in another neighborhood. - I doubt you live around here. - No, but I come here often. My mother lives here. She's elderly so I shop for her. - And it's cheaper here, right? - It all seems expensive to me. No, trust me. For example, this same bottle in a wine shop downtown costs ten euros and here it's only seven. - Can I see? - Sure. This is no good. Do you know wines? No, I don't even drink. Well, sometimes at lunch with a glass of water. I bought this exact same bottle a few days ago but I had to throw it out. I'm glad you told me. I'll put it back. You have to know the brand. Especially... Take this can. They're the most dangerous ones. If you see a dent in one, don't buy it - because you might get botulism. - Really? Didn't you hear about that family that was found dead - after eating... - Botulism No, jam - with the virus in it. - Botulism, like I said. I'm trying to help you and you're mocking me. No, I'm sorry. That is very good advice. I wish I had someone like you to help me do the shopping. You don't have anyone? No. God, I'm so nosy. Sorry! No, no one. I guess no one can put up with me. Well... I come here every Friday. If you come on Fridays too, we can do it together. Bye. - You lied before. - About what? You said it was no good but you're taking it. Sorry, how silly! I didn't realize it. Would you have dinner with me? No. Thank you but I'm married. I figured that much. All right, bye. How about Friday? Okay, - what time? - Is eight okay? Eight o'clock, here. When did I drill you last, De Angelis? I don't remember. How many times have I told you! "I don't remember, Madam. " Better yet: "I don't remember, Madam. Thank you. " Sorry. Then again, what can I expect from you people. Come here. Let's see, have you studied? Not much, Madam. Not good. I'll flunk you all if you don't study. I've warned your parents. All right, I'll help you out. What subject do you want to be drilled in? Geography. I know all the world capitals. "Geography, Madam. Thank you"! Fine, since you know so much... ...what's the capital of the Philippines? Quezon City. Wrong, dunce. It's Manila. But it says Quezon City in my map. Because your map is a dunce like you. Let's try the back-up question. What are the economic resources in the Philippines? Cattle? Fishing? Tourism? You said you knew your Geography. You don't know anything. Good-for-nothing dunce, is what you are. I'm going to flunk you, boy. And I haven't seen your girlfriend in a week. Tell her to come back or I'll fail her too. I don't know where she is. She's working the streets! What's wrong? I shouldn't have listened to you, I should have picked the restaurant. Don't you like it? Ten forks, I'll make you look bad. You are so... Here you are. Isn't that what you say? Let's get a little more personal. Tell me something about yourself. About me... like what? Well, for example... When did you start painting? I don't know. I used to watch my father paint when I was little and I liked it. He looked so important. I wanted to be like him. But what... What do you like about my work? I haven't thought about it. But you... You liked it and bought some. Of course I liked it. I've never shown them to anyone. Well, people have seen them but I never wanted to sell them. I've never been able to let go of them. I don't know what happened, but I feel so crowded now. Then... Then you bought them. You made me feel so important for the first time. When's Mom coming back? She said she hasn't gone out in years and Dad's not democratic. Your mother's a total bitch. Try and get some sleep. Isn't she coming home? Yes, she is! Now get to sleep. - Goodnight. - Night, Dad. How did you end up there? Where? In that neighborhood. Why do you ask? You don't seem to belong. Am I wrong? Yes. All right, it's because of Alfredo. Your husband? Yes, my husband. How did you meet him? We went to school together, I was young. Then what? Then, things just happened. Are you happy? I don't know anyone, I never talk to anyone. Over the years I just stayed inside... But no more. What are you going to do? Take Giampiero and run away. I want to paint, I'm good at it. I want to travel and be happy. I want everything I can. No more settling for things. No more. Did you have fun? Yes. Who did you go with and where? You promised you wouldn't ask, I never go out without you. Go dry off, you're all wet. We're closed! You guys are still out? Don't you have a home? Well? We're closed, Pugliese. I have something you might want. Someone like you has something I might want? Look in a mirror. All you have is lice. - I haven't been feeling well. - I can see that. Giacinto said you might... You fucking idiot, you want everyone to see? Why would I want this piece of shit? He said you're an expert - and might be interested. - Give it up. You're a collector. I can give you 65 euros. Sixty-five? This is a gold Rolex! This is locally made! - At least 80. - Sixty-five and go fuck off. Sixty-five for that? What now? - Can't I get a beer? - No way! If they catch me giving you a beer I'll get a 1,000 euro fine. Now beat it. - Are you Giampiero? - Yes. Romana's in the school theatre. Hi, Romana. Where have you been? With him, that guy. But now I'm back because I have a better idea. Get me pregnant. Why? We have to get married and live together. He can't do anything to me if we're married. I don't know how. It's easy, I'll show you. Take your trousers off. No, I'm too embarrassed. - What if someone comes in? - No one will. How do you know? They found a dead rat in here. If there are rats, I'm leaving. There aren't, I put it in here. Why? Just because. It doesn't matter, we can do it some other time. No, now. - De Angelis! - What are you doing? Do you think this is a whorehouse? These are your students, nothing like this has ever happened! You'll be punished as an example! You, with your trousers down, you'll get the worst punishment! What will they think of us now? From now on, you'll listen to me. - I'll whack you if you talk to her again. - Stop it! Stop, my ass. He'll change his ways, you'll see. You're so uncouth. And you're a bitch. I did this one two years ago. We were on holiday, I was so happy then. We were all happy back then. Those were great times. I was pregnant with Giampiero here, - This was afterwards. - Here I was... - So it was afterwards? - Yes, a couple of years later. How much is it? Ask Father Pierluigi. There he is. Italo, pour me another one. Why are you getting drunk instead of being with your wife at her first showing? Forget that. It's pointless doing things for women. About your son's little gypsy girl... Do you know what happened? They robbed the Cesaroni's when they were on holiday. Fantoni's wife saw them. She never sleeps. She said it was three gypsy girls from the camp out front. We told her to press charges but she doesn't want trouble. We need to do something. I've got enough shit to deal with! How are you? I'm fine. Is your mother selling her paintings? No, she already sold them. It's just a showing. I couldn't care less. I'm angry at you. We promised we wouldn't see each other. You did because you're a jerk. No, you promised too. I was there, I heard you. Yes, but I was faking it. You promised you'd marry me then you said you don't even look at me. I bet if someone else asks you. you'd promise anything, asshole. You dirty pig, leave Giampiero alone! Room twenty, please. - For the kid? - De Angelis, I'm his father. - Relax. - Is it serious? - Tell me what happened. - They're treating him. He got beat up, they're treating him. Wait for them to finish. - Relax. - Relax, my ass! The doctor said it's not serious. A couple weeks in bed and he'll be fine. This is your fault, kid. Be quiet. The Carabinieri chief is waiting for me to press charges. Why did they do this? You tell me, Luciana! Where are you going? What is it, sweetie? Don't strain yourself, tell me tomorrow. Where's Romana? What? Grandma's little boy, what did they do? This is a warrant from the city government. It says you can't stay here. You have 48 hours to leave. You've been given temporary arrangements. Get those gypsies out of here! We worked hard around here. He just had to get involved. Will you stop talking? Listen honey, if it weren't for my money you'd have to work, not be an artist. And those paintings... Don't get me started. What's wrong with them? They're ugly! And look at how you dress. Can I help you? This is Alfredo De Angelis's mother, he was just arrested. I'm just dropping her off. Have a nice day, everyone. Who are you? I'm looking for Romana's mother. - Why? - To talk, it's about my son Giampiero, Romana's homework friend. I remember. Come with me. I wanted to tell you they're releasing our husbands tomorrow. What do you want from me? Nothing, I'm sorry. I was wondering about Romana. My son is sad because he doesn't know where she is. My daughter is gone. She's with an evil relative. Where did they take her? Quiet! The Carabinieri gave you 48 hours, we're giving you two! After that, we'll be back to shoot you all! Now be quiet while my friend pays back a favor. You come here. Which trailer's yours? All right, I'll just burn them all. Look who's here. Does your husband know? Othello? What are you doing? We're doing it for your son too, move! You idiot! Please, this is my house. It's all I have. Shut up or you're all dead. I'll shoot the first one to breathe! That's good, let's go. Two hours, that's all! You're a pig! You make me sick. You and these gypsies make me sick. I'm Italo, that's right. Me and the other guys... I did what needed to be done to get rid of this trash. This run-down disgusting mess. You animal! If you even think of going to the police, I swear to God, I'll kill you. A horrible thing happened. What? Please, help me. I don't know where to go, or what to do... Please help me. Relax and tell me what happened. - Is it your husband? - They said they'd kill me, They said they'd kill me if I tell the police. - Who? They burnt those poor people's trailers, - the gypsies. - Gypsies? What are you saying? - They said they'd kill me. - What did you do? Why you? Because I was there, I saw them. I saw what they did. I was there because of my son and I saw what they did, I recognized them. - You recognized them? - Two of them. They're friends of Alfredo. One is a drink supplier and the other one owns a bar. A bar? You mean Italo? Yes, you know him? I defended him in court once. You probably got him off too. I'm a lawyer. This time he's gone too far. Are you willing to report him? Yes. Take me home. I'm innocent! Let me go, I'm innocent. Mommy! Hi, Grandma. Hi, sweetie. Look what Grandma brought you. Snacks, fruit juice and oranges to get vitamins. I'm sorry I couldn't come before, but how can I with the store? It's okay, Grandma. Ever since it happened, your dad only works half days. Your mother tattled. They hate us. I thought about closing the shop... Your mother moved out, your dad is always depressed. In my day, a woman would get slapped for that! I don't care anymore. I don't want to move house. Kids don't make decisions, adults do. Grandma... I need a favor, but you can't tell anyone. Don't even read it, promise? Yes, I promise. You have to give it to Romana, she lives in front of us. The gypsies don't live there anymore. And neither do you. FAILED What's your name? Giampiero. Your mother said you were here. I have something for you. What? A letter from Romana. She said to ask your grandmother for your address. "Dear Giampiero, I hope you're okay and that you still remember me. I always think of you and tell everyone how good you are. I hope you passed second grade so you can go to university. I'm fine, I am a housewife now. But I can't leave so I'm a little sad. Everyone cares about me here but I'd like to go to the movies. They won't let me. Once I tried and they punched me. They broke a tooth. I didn't cry, but I'm ugly now and can't be an actress anymore. Come save me or I'll kill myself. We're somewhere by the sea, and we'll be here for a while. Come take me away, but be careful. They'll kill you if they catch you. Come soon, Romana. " All right, I'll take you home. But I'm going out for a while. I have to find him. I'm worried, Alfredo. Have you heard from the gypsy girl? No, no one has. Not her parents or relatives, no one. Giampiero can't stop thinking about her. He's so young yet he acts like it's the love of his life. I know this isn't the right time, but it's better that I tell you now. Mom sold the store, she can't take it anymore. The money's mine... It isn't very much, but it's not too little either. If you want, we can go somewhere else. Either a different city, or abroad. Abroad... Please, Luciana. Give me another chance. I've always loved you. Romana, wake up... I'm here to save you, let's go! - Is that you? - Of course, let's go! You can wear my shoes. No, it's cold and you'll get sick. Look, my tooth is broken. You can't even tell. They broke it. Where do we go now? I don't know. I know somewhere we can go. Where? My cousin's, the one who sells flowers. I went there once, I made a lot of money. Selling flowers is humiliating. No, it isn't. We'll make money, then go live by ourselves. Where? In the house we'll live in when we get married. I don't know if I want to get married. Then you're a traitor. We can't get married, we're too young. Then we won't get married, as long as we're together. But you have to forgive me. No, I don't. You didn't do anything to me. If you're a man, you have to forgive me. Okay. Say you forgive me. I forgive you. It's beautiful!
