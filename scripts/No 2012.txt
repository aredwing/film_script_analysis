After 15 years of dictatorship, Pinochet faced increasing international pressure to legitimize his regime. In July, 1988, a referendum was held. The people would vote YES or NO to another 8-year term for Pinochet. For 27 days, the two sides would fight it out daily on TV: 15 minutes for the YES camp and 15 for the NO. First of all, I'd like to say that what you're about to see fits with the current social context. We believe the country is ready for communication like this. Absolutely. Remember, the citizens have increased demands about the truth, and what they want. Let's be honest: Today, Chile is thinking of its future. Let's watch. The new soft drink has arrived! It's young, liberated, and Free! The time has come The time is right for Free It's what you were waiting for It was made for you And now, Free! Refresh yourself now! And feel Free! Free like you Now, you. Now, Free! It's OK, but... Why the fuck is there miming in my film? When did we talk about miming? There is no doubt that... that it is very well done, You can see the effort. Carlos, This is very, very, very original. It might work in the US, but we have to trust our product. We have a product different to the competition. It invites you to be young, and be brave. If you're brave, you're Free. I think. This is everything our youth needs. Music, a rebellion, an idyll. But with order and respect. Excuse me. There's a Mr. Urrutia... No, we're in a meeting. He's here. Here? Please go and see. Go on. OK. Take a look at the 30-second version. There's no miming in it. Thanks. Jos Toms Urrutia? Yes. The communist? Yes. What do you want? You've become very fucking important. No wonder you won't take my calls now. I work. What's going on? How's Vero doing? Well, I suppose. What can I do for you? I'm working on the campaign for the referendum. I know. For the NO campaign, of course. Everyone knows. What does everyone know? That you're with the NOs, and you want me to do the campaign. Who? Me. You? Yes. Me. No. Besides... Why are you bothering with it? This election is rigged from the outset. Listen, international pressure has forced Pinochet to agree to an opposing campaign. This is our chance to overthrow the dictatorship. So, Pinochet set up a referendum in order to lose it. No, be serious, I'm being serious, man. Pinochet could win this vote without cheating, if he wants. Really? That's what's so terrible. Legally? People either vote for him or not at all. No, let's take a cab. We'll take a bus. A political campaign takes up a lot of time. A lot of people... A good team. Of course, but the campaign is in the hands of experts in political communication who know their job and do it well. Let me tell you that at first, I wasn't too sure, but they've surprised me. Good people, responsible, capable. What I need, man... is an external opinion. An opinion! Just an opinion from me? I wouldn't even give you that. Calm down, man. No! I didn't know you were pals with that communist. Urrutia's no communist. Yes he is. No. He was my classmate. I know him. No, he's not a communist. What is he, then? He's the other... Christian Democrat? No. Socialist? No! It doesn't matter, they're all forms of communism. No, I know Urrutia from... He's a family friend. Are you going to tell me how microwave works? It's laser technology. Invisible heat, and you say "a" microwave. A microwave. Yes. You were offered the NO campaign? Are we going to talk about that or about a microwave? You tell me, dickwad. Yes. Yes, but I said no, I didn't have the time, I had my hands full, and I couldn't. I'm only going to give them my opinion. Even if it hurts you. Thank you. You're such a showoff, asshole. Loads of people are offering me work. Freelance. With your family background, I never should have hired you. You'd have passed up a goldmine. And what about you? Forget my loyalty to Pinochet. Please be coherent. You didn't share that goldmine with the communists. Enough with the communists, old lady. An old lady? No, an old man. Who's on board with the campaign? I don't know. Did they call anyone from abroad? No, just me I think. You? Yes. But you've been away for ages. What do you know about it? Nothing. Do they have money? No. The communists don't have money. It's not them. Oh no? So who is it then? Everyone but the communists. Not the communists. Nicaragua, Cuba and the Soviet Union didn't put any money in. No. The Americans did. No, they're on our side. And yet they did it. The CIA financed the coups and are supporting us. How much are they paying you? The Americans are with the NO. ...for public spaces, we've designed some posters. This doesn't mean that these are the definitive ones: "If I govern, you govern" "YES, for a winning country" "We are millions." Lucho Guzman. Explain to us your theory about reactionary people. No, Minister. What I meant to say is that the concept of dictatorship packs a strong punch. And that on top of that, now they're going to say it on TV. split into different opinions lost in the middle of the night. That's what the opposition has. The YES camp will have those 15 minutes and all of the remaining time, too. They didn't have that platform before. Platform? How many parties are there? Seventeen. It'll be chaos. They'll fight like cat and dog. The general is respected everywhere. Even the biggest hypocrites know he's modernized this country. Do you know what I've heard my fellow Argentineans say? "We want a Pinochet." Everyone wants a Pinochet. Show him. You control the radio, the newspapers, television. But... we have to get him out of uniform, and compose an elegant, very Chilean anthem, for the people to sing with pride, to the general in a suit. That spells trouble. How about in black tie? I prefer him in a suit. I think we should take advantage of his blue eyes, his smile. We'd need to test it, Minister, to be sure. I'd make him wear a pearl. It's very elegant. I'll have to talk to him. Pinochet out of uniform is a government without soldiers, in other words, progress. This country's progress has been stunning. It's not like Latin America. You don't realize the... your influence in the world. But these "gauchos" keep protesting. The country is full of ingrates. They forgot everything. So scare them. Excuse me? You've lost me. Shouldn't we show a nicer face? If you want to scare people, scare them with their past. Their past of poverty, endless queues for bread. The opposition misses socialism, but the only thing people care about is handouts. They know socialism makes them unhappy. Here, you have a system in which anyone can get rich. Careful, not everyone. But anyone. You can't lose when everyone is dreaming about being that anyone. Move, dammit! Move, you idiot! Free the political prisoners! Free them all! Why just some of them? Veronica! Fucking cops! Stop it! Why are you hitting her? You're hitting a woman! Out! How can you hit a woman? Let her go, motherfucker! Let her go, asshole! Let go of me! How much longer? How much longer, for fuck's sake? That's right. Turn the news on. OK. There. Free the nation from frayed populist paths and economical stagnation and lead it to modernization and progress for all Chileans. Augusto Pinochet Ugarte. from a very young age showed his love for serving his country, influenced by the stories of the nation's forefathers which set ablaze his courage, and made him enter the military. From dawn to dusk, he worked tirelessly... Give me that. ...Devoting all of his time, his attention and his energy. He sacrificed himself. He endured everything to accomplish his mission to save Chile. Iorana, President Hear the voices of your people Thank you for coming Ariki Nui Carmen! For being here, Ariki Nui Ariki Nui Iorana, President We will always be here Thank you for giving us A home to live in Ariki Nui, Ariki Nui Mahu Ariki Nui My main concern is... not losing what we've won. That's what matters. This is for Simon, OK? OK. Is he asleep? I don't know. Nice. How have you been? Fine. Fine. And Simon? He feels lonely. And the maid? Fine. Is she a good cook? Yes. He's not alone. He knows I'm here. Did they hit you much? No. That kid understands everything. No, he doesn't get any of it. Neither do I, to tell you the truth. The maid can't do everything. You're going to work for the NO? To do what? To win. You'll legitimize Pinochet's sham. You'll say yes, he's my president. this is my constitution. Mercenary. The boy has to get up at 7am. Why don't you stay tonight? We'll have breakfast together. OK. Are they paying you well? I can't complain. Oh, well. Let me give him a kiss, please. Go ahead. I love you, sweetheart. We're going to get rid of Pinochet. WAR PRISONERS MEETING POIN 34,690 TORTURED 200,000 EXILED 2,110 POLITICAL EXECUTIONS 1,248 DISAPPEARED DETAINEES FOR FREE ELECTIONS VOTE NO Right. Ren, we're listening. Is that all? I think so, isn't it? Sorry. There's nothing else? Something else? Something else... Something a little lighter. A little nicer. Comrade, do you think that what's going on in Chile is nice? No. Let's see... It moves me as it moves all of you. However, I think that it's not very appealing. Well. Let's try. Let's try, from both sides, to give more constructive opinions. Me too? Everyone. Let's give our opinions, and move on. I'd like to know if anyone thinks we can win with this campaign. I think the main objective... Excuse me? We must open the eyes of those who don't want to vote. That's the main objective. Dictatorship has destroyed this country and will continue to destroy it, with its economic success and 40% of the population living below the poverty line. We all agree we want to win the referendum, but some only want to win, without really reforming Chile. We want another kind of victory. But the advertiser asked a different question. Our comrade asked if you think that we're going to win. The answer is no. We don't think that we're going to win. The referendum was lost from the moment the fascist right called for it. Then why pitch this campaign? To raise awareness and fill the spaces the dictatorship had to open, and which we won. Let us fill them. Exactly. Let them allow us to win, maybe, but let them accept us. If we already lost, we should give up. This referendum is a fraud, we know it. Dad, what are you doing? I'm working. This isn't work, you're playing. Hand me the rocket. It's over there. I'm going to put it together! Really? It's already put together. Then I'm going to drive it. Stop it, please. I want to play with my train. Go to bed. Abstentions: 35.1%, 146... "YES" votes: 19%. Abstainers: 76,2%. That's it. Thank you. What do you think of this? A feeling of false hope, deeply internalized, preventing the voters from feeling free at the moment of voting, because they're completely repressed. As a result, with so many unanswerable questions, the results are quite unsure. As for the fear, it is significantly increasing the number of undecided voters. These two are the undecided groups, no? Those who don't know if they'll vote? Yes. It's impossible. You can't make a campaign with such extremes. Their interests are too different. It's impossible. How impossible, would you say? We need a miracle. I think you've said the key word. We need a miracle. In other words, God, and His celestial army, angels and archangels. Faith. That's what's going to change Chile. This country needs a divine act. How are you? Fine. I don't want to lose any clients. Or get beat up. Nobody will know. I'm not here. Jos Toms, Alberto Arancibia. Inside this rat lurks my mentor, my best friend. He came but "he's not here." OK? Don't worry, I understand. Can I get you a drink? Would you like that? We have a group of undecided voters who, in reality, would vote NO. But the indecision involves whether to vote or not. What? They're the old ladies, around 60 or 65 years old, middle class, or lower middle class. They are scared of what NO represents, a return to socialism, to recession, to queues and all that. And there's the young people who think that this election is fixed, and it's useless. We have to find a solution. No, a product. We need a product that is sufficiently appealing to old ladies and to young people. Ms. Carmen? Do you have a second? We'd like to ask you something. While we were chatting, Ren told us that you're voting YES. Is that true? She's voting YES. Her silence shows that she's voting YES. Could you tell us why? I'm doing fine. My son is in college. My daughter has work. And what about the dead, the tortured, and the disappeared? What do you think about that? It's not that I don't care about it, but that's all in the past. Democracy is the future. My General says we can have an opinion thanks to this vote. Democracy is the problem. The old man's taken hold of the term "democracy." We haven't worked that much, we spent our time walking and eating. That's work, too, Jos Toms. Isn't it, Alberto? No! We haven't talked about what defines us as an opposition: human rights, exile, injustice, arbitrary arrests, torture, disappearances. All the pain we've lived through. We didn't even mention it. We have to. It's got nothing to do with it. We must talk about it. It's too dark. That's fear. We can't bombard folks with fear. They're scared. Terrorized. We have to find a product that appeals to people. Democracy isn't a product. Fine, let's call it a concept. We have to offer something pleasing, but which has meaning, something... happy. Let's list everything that's happy. Happiness, joy, fulfillment. Yes, but what is...? Springtime, parties. The calm after the storm. To me, democracy's fun. It's appealing. It's something... attractive to experience. A fun product. Then happiness itself. Of course. What's happier than happiness? Nothing. Happiness in itself is happy. What's happier than that? Come on, we need to be serious here. If you think I'm going to stand there in front of all the whole coalition, and say our campaign will be based on jokes, and happiness, you're nuts. It's totally nave and disrespectful. We have to consider their pain, their neglect. Where is that? How am I going to tell them that our concept is happiness? Why not? How's it going? They're there. Pass me the... Now? Thank you. You're welcome. They're here. I'm on it. Hey, Diego. This is what we have. I like these ones best. And Guzman? Is he watching you? Is he watching me? How? No, he won't know how. Great. Is he here or not? No. Fine. Look, here he is. Fernando. How are you? It's good to see you. Ren Saavedra, Fernando Costa. We know each other. Really? Through work. I've rescued him before. He's going to work with us as a director. You know very well that I don't do that. You've done it a thousand times. I don't know, call up a rocker, a folk singer, someone to write an anthem. No. I want a jingle. No art, no folk, no pop, no rock, a jingle. Do you really think they'll let us go out on air? Yes. They'll throw us in jail! We don't know. We don't? We don't know. The key thing is all being here. Thanks. Many wouldn't have dared. Listen, if you draw a line with this vote, what's left? No more! No more Pinochet and dictatorship! Well? It could work! It's perfect, man. No more torture, no more deaths. No more censorship. No more abuse. No more debt, no more interest, no more unpaid bills. How's things with you? We need more people, more time. More content. We have to fill 15 minutes every day for a month. They fill each day. We better get to work. That one... It's finished. See you at the production office. Yeah, he's coming. How are you, Lucho? We're about to begin. Is everything OK? Yeah. How are you? Fine. Great. Weren't you going to give it up? It's just advice. Don't bullshit me, man. You have an easy life with your son, your own house, a sports car, plenty to eat. No one has bothered you since you got here. Let's be partners. I'll cut you in on the agency. You're a rat, boss. Why? You threaten me and you offer me... Hello. How are you? How are you? How about those dishes! They're great! We're ready for you. We'll be right over. Whenever you say! A partnership? Yes. A good percentage. I'm going to do this anyway. That camp. Hello. How are you? Nice of you to come. Hello. You look nice. Thank you. I'm handling everything, it's all fine. Excellent, thank you. This is suicide, don't be an idiot. Fire me. First positions! Get out. Fire me! Get out! Fire me! Leave. Go ahead, fire me. Think about my offer. It's good. Fine. We're done here. It's perfect. What is it? Important accounts from the state broadcaster. I'll talk with the bitch. Where is she? Over there. It's great, isn't it? It's perfect. Everything OK? Is it working? Yes. Is it? Chicken. Mind the radiation. Don't get too close. I'll stay away. Yes. I don't think this thing's very safe. You OK with the skirt? Yes, I feel comfortable. Good. Great. Everything suits you. It's really good. It's beautiful. What dish did you choose? What? What dish did you choose? We'll start with dessert. We're getting ready to shoot. First of all, I'd like to say that what you're about to see fits with the current social context. After all, today, Chile is thinking of its future. Let's go. They say what they like I have freedom of thought Because I feel it's time To find freedom We're tired of the abuse It's time to change We're done with poverty I'm going to say NO Chile Happiness is coming Chile Happiness is coming Is that all you have? Because... This is all we have as, let's say, a draft. This is the campaign. It's like an ad for Coca-Cola. It's more than that! With all due respect, we're doing something much more serious. I was also exiled. He's Manuel Saavedra's son, I don't know if you know him. Everyone knows Manuel Saavedra. We're using advertising language that is universal, familiar, attractive, optimistic, but with a political concept behind it. Ricardo. Look, Jos Toms, I understand perfectly well that there's advertising semiology. This is a campaign. We must be pragmatic. We are, by getting involved in a referendum held for the dictatorship. We're taking big risks, we have no idea what's going to happen. I understand. But I also understand that there are ethical limits. What's your name? Ren Saavedra. Ren. I knew your father very well. Ren, maybe in your editing room, making ads for big corporations, you've lost a little perspective. We have physically suffered the violence of this dictatorship. My brother has disappeared, my best friends' throats cut. This is a campaign of silence. We understand, and for good reason, your pain, and the pain of all of those involved. But you're missing a key point. I'm not an idiot, Jos Toms. I get what this is about. This is legitimization. This is a campaign to silence what has really happened. I'm shocked, Fernando. I'm sorry, comrade and friend of mine, you're involved in this shit. I see here what you really are. Those images are what you are. I see your point, but understand... I understand perfectly well! But I will not be party to something for which history will never forgive us! So you can go fuck yourself, asshole. Go get fucked, yourself. Excuse me. Listen. Yes. Where are the parties in this? They're here, in this idea. I see all the parties, but you explain it better. The rainbow represents all the political parties? Is that the idea? Yes, they're all there. It's all in the rainbow. All the party colors and political tendencies are there. For example: the red, which is very powerful, represents the radicals, communism. Socialism! Sorry, socialism. There's blue, that's very... The most hopeful one, for the Christian Democrats. The green is totally... Social Democrat. Orange for the Humanists, and all those who feel included in that. The PPD can also feel included. All the colors are there. And they all, democratically, bring their differences to the NOs. I'll go on foot. Comrade? Are you ashamed to be with us? Goodbye, brave one! Don't be an asshole! You misunderstand our politicians. Some are worth the bother. Please! They all want out while they can. We already got what we wanted. Now it's time to work! Excuse me, Ren, I don't mean to be a pain, but what is this shit? Are you selling chickens? It's something else, Veronica. Then, this is it. NO, orange, NO, singing bird, NON, petit arbre. NO, mental age of 5. No, it's not that. Shit! This. NO, rainbow. Almost. That one, yes. Almost. OK. Something like... Yes. Looks good on you. But we're going to win. With that? Yes. With that. Sure. Where were you, man? I was at the station. They want the title to be: "Hair Salon Love." No, that's really bad. Really bad. Too menopausal. Can I have that? Thank you. You've got a lot of nerve. This is going to make us famous. A rainbow? Yes, a rainbow. But it's for faggots, isn't it? No, I think it has to do with the flag of the Mapuche people. Gay Mapuches? No, Mapuche Indians. Do you know why you're paranoid? Because you've got homosexual communists there in your office. No Mr. Minister, in my office. there are no homosexuals nor commies. Don't worry about it. No-one will see that propaganda. You think? Of course. Everyone will be sleeping. I'm sleeping at that time. Me too. See? Everyone's sleeping. Who's behind the NO campaign? I don't know any of those people. Who are they? People too much at ease for me. Be careful what you say, Guzman. If I open that door you have to close your eyes. Give me that. Stay here. MARXIST TRAITOR Don't go out! Carmen! What are you doing? What are you doing here? Go to bed. Go! This is a nice neighborhood. Go to bed, Ma'am! Go to bed, you old bitch! Brats. Let's go inside, Carmen. Did you see them? Do you know them? I saw them up close. What happened? We were all threatened last night. Not me, as no-one knows I'm here. Why are you surprised? They know where we live and work, they know everything. Calm down, we'll be fine. The eyes of the world are watching us. I've been being followed for ages. It's normal that they follow us. It means we're doing well. We're getting to them. We have to go to the theater. The actors are waiting. Let's go. Let's go again! From the top! Come on. From the top. This is a positive message, isn't it? With happiness and... Smiling... As much as you can. We'll try. Like "We Are The World". Up there. No. Nothing like that! No. That was never... No. Let's go. It isn't a ring shining on your finger It isn't the prince of the gypsies It isn't the sword of a musketeer It isn't a mystery for the sorcerer I don't like it, no I don't want it, no I don't like it, no I don't want it, no, no I hate seeing him every day I don't like his cold smile I don't like his literature I'm depressed by his mini-culture I don't like it, no I don't want it, no I don't like it, no I don't want it, no, no His words and deeds bring nothing He's no leader to follow His words fail to move me He simply cannot move me I don't like it, no I don't want it, no I don't like it, no I don't want it, no, no The editing room is in back. Action! Action! Don't think that he's indispensable Don't think that he's eternal Don't fluster me with nonsense I don't like him in any way I don't like it, no I don't want it, no Let's do the shot now. Ready, Matas? We got it. Silence! Sound? Rolling! Camera? Speed! Action! Isn't he too tall? No, he's perfect. I don't like it, no What happened? Fernando? Get me some homemade bread... It's weird. There's nothing else right now. No, but how... Fernando, please. Fernando, this looks good. I don't care, no one eats baguettes here. It's fine. It's not a problem. It works. It needs identity. Is this a picnic to you? What did we talk about? People have to see themselves in it. Please, it's lovely. It's fine. It's great. It looks nice. Fernando, it's great. Help me. Stop being a drag. Hello, Pato, how are you? Thank you for coming. Hello, Patricio. How are you? How are you, Pato? Hello. Ren Saavedra. How are you? We'll mike you up. Silence, we're going to roll. Three... Two... One... Action! We democrats are transparent. We understand that government, or "public affairs" to the Romans, interests us all and should take place in public view. I am trained in democracy. Chilean democracy made great efforts to move our country forward, to stimulate its growth, for social justice... Ren. Ren. What's up, man? Don't be childish. You think they're ruining your campaign, and we're losing votes? What's up with you? Nothing. I think there is. It doesn't belong to you. They have the right to speak. We've kept our mouths shut for too long now. Important people are involved. It's a drag. Action! I'm the mother of Alfredo Rojas Castaeda, disappeared on March 4, 1975. I'm the sister of Nicomedes Segundo. I'm the wife of Enrique... Newton Morales Saavedra... ...detained... I'm the mother of Manuel... Miguel Angel... ...disappeared... I'm the sister of Ruperto Torres, disappeared 13 October 1973. You can decide to never let this happen again. No more disappearances. It's good. It's good, but a little ugly. It doesn't fit with what we're doing. We're using it, no matter what. Why? Because it's good. Because it has content, and we have 15 minutes to fill. No matter what? Why that tone? What tone? Who makes the decisions here? You're not the boss, you know. I'm not arguing this bullshit. What bullshit, motherfucker? We're working. Take it easy! This isn't personal! My joy is different than yours. Oh, really? What's mine then? I don't know. What happened here in the last 15 years was never shown on TV Doing that now is my joy. Yes, but if it goes wrong, it's going to look pathetic. It works. I got goosebumps. It's visceral. I love it. I'd put it in. It's in then. And what if we mention it's been that is dissident? Yes, of course. There's... the greeting, right? The slogan is "Happiness is coming." "Chile, happiness is coming." "Hello. Chile, happiness is coming." No, actually... "Chile, happiness is coming" and "hello" after. Weird, right? Yes, but I think it works. And then, "It's been 15 years since..." Exactly. We could try it once. If not, we start over. You're shooting it. Perfect, thank you. We'll do it then. OK. Rolling. Mark. Patricio Baados, take one. And... Action. Chile, happiness is coming. Hello. For the first time in 15 years, those who don't share the official point of view are talking to you through their own TV show. I am returning to my profession that I was removed from. 15 minutes in 15 years isn't much. Let's talk about that coming happiness. Happiness is coming Chile Happiness is coming Chile Happiness is coming They say what they like I have freedom of thought I feel that it's time To find freedom We're tired of the abuse It's time to change We're done with poverty I'm going to say NO A rainbow is born After the storm I want to see flourish A thousand ways of thinking Without dictatorship Happiness will come I think about the future I'm going to say NO We're going to say NO With the power of my voice We're going to say NO I sing it without fear We're going to say NO All together towards victory We're going to say NO For life and for peace We're going to say NO Chile Happiness is coming Chile Happiness is coming Good morning, Mr. Anbal. Two bread rolls, please. Of course, Ms. Yolita. Here you go. Anything else? Some tea. Of course. Two bags? Just one. We all have a reason to vote NO. No more poverty. This man wants peace. This man wants peace. This man is Chilean. This man is Chilean. This man fights for what he believes. This man fights for what he believes. They have the right to live in peace and work for what they believe in. Our nation will be great when no Chilean is afraid of any other Chilean. Chile will be great when everyone has a place in our homeland. So this never happens again. In war, everyone is afraid. Peace is achieved in democracy. This is a voting paper. With it, you will be able to express your decision, freely and in secret on October 5th. Don't miss this event. Go and vote. Without hatred, without violence, and without fear. No more. Vote NO. Now the YES option will use its 15 legal minutes. This is the most important part. What's going on? A horizon of hope Born from an unforgotten September Made us masters of this legacy That we promised to defend A voice that flows like wind Makes the YES in our consciences grow We have a country A winning country YES! In democracy and freedom The people and you Pinochet! Makes this hope possible Today, victory has a name President Pinochet! YES! We want every worker to achieve their maximum to be always respected to become a homeowner and never again a proletariat. This is my commitment. Did you know that on average, Chilean children are today taller and heavier? A winning country YES! On July 3 1986, I was coming home from work, when they announced a peaceful protest. The bus I was traveling in was attacked by terrorists. Many innocent people were injured. I suffered burns on my face and on my hands. We could say many things after watching these horrifying images. But we will only say one: think. In the country of the NO, there's no respect, neither for your possessions, nor for your future, nor your security. When you vote, think about everything you could lose. Think about what you cherish the most, your loved ones. A winning country YES! Our campaign is a piece of garbage. It's appalling. We're throwing our money away. I don't think it's that bad. It's more serious than the others'. My General was very offended. They attacked him personally. It's a mockery. How can we stop this humiliation? It would be a scandal. It would legitimize us internationally. That's what the referendum is for. I don't understand what the problem is. The strategy's driving force was its economic achievement. It has nothing to do with that. We can't fight universal principles like joy or that dumb campaign, a rainbow, with a film about fruit exports. We have strictly followed the client's guidelines. The two premises were: that no-one would see the campaign, and the president couldn't lose. Minister, you said the campaign didn't matter. The president is going to win anyway. Let's cut the bullshit. For fuck's sake. Guzman will from now be in charge of the campaign. It's an honor, Minister. We'll deal with those bastards later. Don't worry, Sir. The NO film'll run out of steam in a couple of days. These people are using advertising tricks, you see? We have to work on one axis: who is capable of governing, and who isn't. We must carry out an audit immediately. I'm sorry, Guzman, but... what do you mean by that? That we're going to screw them. Excuse me? We're going to screw them. Our Father, Holy God today we bless Your name... The fraternal, progressive climate created by Pinochet's government has meant that in April 1987, Pope John Paul II will finally visit our country. Do not be afraid to look at Him! Your campaign is a copy. Love always conquers! A copy of the copy of the copy of the copy of the copy of the copy. Fine. We didn't copy. You mixed rainbows, pretty people, blonde children skipping, celebrating I-don't-know-what. A tall man who's 15 feet tall. Where did you find him? Denmark? Who is that guy? Us Chileans are small. Who are all these people laughing, celebrating? Celebrating what? Us getting screwed in the referendum? I don't know where you think you are. We should do something. I don't want to fuck. After, you'll make a scene. Don't say that! We've done nothing for years. You've got a bad memory. What? Last time, you didn't want to do it. Simon was there. He was sleeping. This is a normal scene in the life of this man. At sunrise or sunset. He always works tirelessly. His time, his energy, the sacrifice of incomprehension, he gives it all to his initial cause. In his words: "For Chile, everything." Don't get up. Shit, I've got to go. Why don't you stay? I can't. Simon needs you. I fell asleep, that's all. Don't get confused. Go on. Stay. What for? Did you pay the school? Yes. With my Allende Foundation grant. Stop it. Bye. Stay. We're pulling Pinochet off the screen. You agree? Let's protect him. Too many soldiers. Too many tacky women. Tacky? Too tacky, too fat. Too many colonels' wives. You don't have enough material. Let's talk about them. About the politicians? No, them. Their campaign is very funny. It's amusing. Shall we add a little humor? Say YES! Dear NO supporters, don't waste your time with lies and fantasies as you have up until now. To us, it is a duty to expose to the country some of the NO camp's lies. THE LIE "Mrs. Yolita" ad. THE TRUTH The protagonist was paid. She has 3 houses, and one business property. God, how awful! We're not going to respond. Who is doing this? OK? I'm going. All right, good luck. Call me when you get home, OK? It's really annoying. What happened? They followed me. Everybody calm down. They're just trying to scare us. It's too dangerous. Do we have any empty boxes? Or tapes? Yes, we do. Here. We'll leave with this, all at the same time. Let me go out first. Hand me the original. You're sure? The National TV Council? Come in. This is the NO campaign. Sign the form. Here? Yes. And I'll give you... a receipt. Receipt. Very well. Sir...? Ren Saavedra. Thank you. Tomorrow's. Thank you. TORTURE IN CHILE THE TV IS SILEN Those who have appeared number more than 50. All of them tortured by the CNI. These people have endured endless torture sessions, lasting days at a time and into the night, until 3 or 4 in the morning. They are then thrown, like useless pieces of trash, onto the cot in their cells. They rest for a few hours only to start all over again. Without hatred. Without violence. Without fear. No more. There's a call from the CANT. What is it concerning? Good. Don't worry. Goodbye and thank you. Tomorrow's program can't be aired. The judge's section breaks the law. The judge? You put the judge in? We're changing nothing. This is censorship. We have to go on air. Or people will get scared. Let's hold a press conference, and denounce it... I'm sick of your fucking denouncements! We must be more creative and turn this around. NO CENSORSHIP Chile Happiness is coming Hello. Through these programs, we have realized that it's important to say things how they are. Expressing oneself and talking is a good thing. Censorship is pointless. Why censor? But for 15 years, a large part of this country was prevented from doing what we've done on this show. NO-EWS Public opinion has unanimously condemned the censorship of the opposition's television program. During last Monday's NO campaign, a judge was prevented from appearing who confirmed the CNI's involvement in over 50 cases of torture. It was wrong. Why? Because they are hiding what really happened. It's very frustrating. Very. You realize everything is fake. It's an outrage, a daily outrage. The government is afraid of us knowing the truth. They wanted to stop the NO show. It's unfair. It is bad. They just do what they want. Yet another injustice. It doesn't suit them for the truth to be known. Why don't we have the right to see what has been going on in this country? Democratically, we have the right to be freely informed. That's what I think. How are you, Saavedra? How's Simon? I like your little train. Simon? Are you ok? Yes. Hi, darling. Hi, Mommy. Hello. How are you? Here. Be a good boy. OK. Listen to your mother. Don't go out by yourself, you hear me? They're doing this because you hit the old man hard. I love you, sweetie. It's all good. Congratulations. Hello. Did you have breakfast? No. Would you like some? No, thanks. If you need anything, just let me know. You work with the YES camp? No. No, it's... it's just advisory. Did you see it? There's a change in the conceptual strategy. Did you like it? It's bad. Real bad. It's awful, Lucho. It's a huge pile of shit. It's the copy of the copy of the copy of the copy of the copy. It's all mixed together there. How will people remember this campaign? The employees made the NO campaign, and you bosses made the YES one. That's how it's going to be. We're going to screw you. So shut up, asshole, and look after your son. Don't threaten me. I'm just saying. If they want cash, let me talk. Hello. Hello Ren. How are you? Shall we go? How's it going, Pedro? "Beautiful" And "Bold" in something youthful, more playful. Most viewers will watch this soap opera. What we want to do is produce a marketing event to present the soap opera Beautiful and Bold on the Santa Maria tower. We want to avoid a typical soap opera ad filmed with crappy lighting. It makes it look cheap and ugly. We want to create a news story, and insert it under camouflage, into the evening news program. Perfect! The girls will be on the terrace, on the heliport. All the actresses, dressed in their best clothes, doing a photo shoot. We can reuse the pics from the shoot. We can use them twice. We'll also have the soap's heartthrobs, the actors, dressed like... James Bond. But with more of an "action" feel and more modern. We'll have the models and the actresses showing off their best features. And a helicopter flying around the tower with the soap opera's main heartthrob leaning right out with a bunch of roses for the girls. Wave to them! No, the election is under control. Don't worry, Guzman. But they're making noise. They could hinder any measures you take. They'll happen anyway. Ensure their name is mud, expose those clowns for what they are. This will upset the NO camp. Who are all these people? We couldn't find any artists. They're all with them. This is all that's left. The bottom of the barrel. That's enough. I'm leaving. The idea is that, no matter what your option is, or who you vote for, ou pour qui vous votez, the important thing is what you feel through these TV programs. The lady will ask questions and the idea is to build a debate. The NO camp seem too serious, too strange. They talk about problems that concern old people. Matilde, tell us about the YES campaign. I thought it was too violent and underhand. Underhand... What is your name? We need more testimonials. No, more humor. Did you like the NO campaign? To make it more fun and more inclusive. Be careful with that letter! Turn off that light! Pay attention for a moment! Thank you all for coming. We're very happy. The soldiers will be proud to see their musicians, actors, and artists committed to the NOs. We can shoot. with a 2.8 lens. Closer, Marco Antonio, please. Let's do it. We must put on a good show. OK? Show me happiness. Sound? Rolling. Camera? Speed. Mark. Action! Chile, happiness is coming! This land was not a propitious place for warlords and strikes. The new democracy... Is it OK? Or not? No. It's no good. He abandons his uniform for regular clothes. After so much hatred and threats, he now offers peace. He is alone. He alone speaks. What would you say to a dictator? 15 years ago, the dictatorship began here, and we've had it up to here! But it ends now. My love, say yes. No. Say it for me. Come on, say yes! Please. All right then, NO! If the YES camp triumph, everything will be much better, according to the results of the latest polls. What were the results? YES wins. A winning country. YES! Comrade Happiness is coming! Destroy everything Happiness is coming! For life and for peace! Have you seen the time? We had stuff to do. ...with the power of my voice We're going to say NO I sing it without fear We're going to say NO Together victorious Tous ensemble pour gagner We're going to say NO For life and for peace A Marxist dressed in velvet is still a Marxist! Chile Happiness is coming! Today, huge rallies closed the electoral campaigns. The YES camp held huge celebrations for the arrival of President Pinochet. There's a carnival-like atmosphere. You can feel the joy on Bernardo O'Higgens Boulevard. Thousands of people have come together to say YES. They support Pinochet and will return a big majority on October 5th. Foreigners have refused to film these scenes of joy. They refuse to show Pinochet's thousands of supporters. Meanwhile, the NO supporters marched today to where the freeway meets the road in Santiago. The main speaker there was the spokesman for the NO coalition and Christian Democrat leader, Patricio Aylwin. I've said it clearly: if the referendum is held under the correct conditions, we will accept the result, whatever it is. NO to hunger! NO to exile! NO to violence! NO to suicide! We will dance together for this NO We will dance together for this NO! We ask the authorities to not attack us! Fuck, my car! Remain calm! Here! Give me your hand! No violence! Please! We ask the authorities... Come! Close your eyes! What's happening, Daddy? Murderers! Murderers! What are you doing? Why are you there? Go home! Hold on tight! Come on! Let's go! Daddy! Give me your hand! Get in! And stay here! And Mommy? Did you hear me? Stay here! Take Simon home! Take Simon home! Where are you going? Where are you going, Saavedra? She's my wife! Go home. Hello. The officer in charge? Yes, Colonel. She's here, they told me. Thanks, Lucho. Don't worry, I'd have done it for any of my people. Happiness, huh? My congratulations. Unbeatable. Thank you very much. It's quite alright. Hello. This is our last program. For the last 27 days, I've been here showing you the whole of Chile. This morning, we'd like to say while you stay at home and rest, NO to hatred, NO to violence. And in this message, we are not alone. Remember that the ballot is secret and the future of your country is in your hands. The pain of Chile over these long years has been the pain of all of us. We'll be with you in our hearts on October 5. NO-EWS Which flags do you sell most of? YES or NO ones? NO ones mostly. Do the YES ones sell? A little. Not much. How many badges sold today? 1,500 NO badges. And 50 YES ones. More NO ones. That's why I've only got NO things here. That's what sells best. This program is coming to an end. We've run out of time. From now on, you will only hear the official opinion. Freedom for Chile and its TV coverage now depends on you. Happiness is in your hands. See you soon. THE YES CAMP WILL USE ITS 15 LEGAL MINUTES My love, say YES. Honey, it's NO. Tell me YES. Come over here. Tell me YES. YES! YES! In the other campaign, this ends with a NO. In this campaign, it ends with a YES. You choose! Consider that this country has a great future ahead of it! Great expectations! Don't throw it all away. I don't recommend myself. You judge. If I did wrong, forgive me. But if you do the math, it adds up pretty positively. A winning country... YES! In compliance... with the laws governing the electoral process, the TV channels have been integrated into the state channel. From now on, retransmissions can continue separately. Long live Chile and Pinochet! Of course. You have a call. Excuse me. Go right ahead. Don't worry. Everything's fine. Where will you celebrate? With the family... and friends. Are you confident? The little campaign's over. It's now a matter of state. Let them dance a while. Are you celebrating? Yes. Are you going to eat? From north to south, the best team. All the news and information from where it happens, across the entire country. Televisin Nacional of Chile. Across the capital and the rest of the country, voting booths were set up early in the morning. The public, following official recommendations, began arriving to vote from first light, causing some traffic jams in certain areas. A few minutes before 11am, the President exercised his right as a citizen, voting at table number 1. The images show the Head of State completing each stage of the process. Patricio Aylwin Azocar voted at table number 16. 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96... The Undersecretary of the Interior is on the podium. I shall now read the third official count by the Ministry of the Interior which is currently announcing a 57.36% YES vote, and a 40.54% NO vote. He can't give those results. Of course they want to win, but they can't. They can't, right? I don't think so. Easy, now. I didn't want to say it out loud, but apparently, the old fucker refuses to accept the results. The cops are leaving. I don't understand. Maybe Ricardo knows... They've all gone? Simon! Come. It's a self-coup! Get out the torches. They want to screw us! We have to back up the computers. What's the procedure? For those counting votes by hand, you are each responsible. They're robbing us! There's foreign journalists everywhere. So? It'll be OK. Will the foreigners help? We need help! Let's call some journalists! International help or we're screwed! This is critical. We cannot lose. Jos Toms! Listen! Our parallel count shows that we won. This can't go on. They're trying to buy some time. This may keep happening more and more frequently. We don't know anything either. Fucking military! The TV, please! ...outside the Moneda Palace, where all the generals are arriving. They've been summoned to an emergency meeting by President Pinochet. General Matthei! Does the government have the results? To me, it really looks like the NO vote has won. It seems pretty clear to me now. That was the General of the Air Force, Fernando Matthei... The generals are abandoning Pinochet. They're forcing him to recognize the victory. So that means... this thing is over. Shit, we won! We won! Really? Yes! We won! The YES vote won 43.04%. The NO vote won 54.68%. Today, a new Chile is born. Fairer and more unified, with no privileges; we all have the right to think different... Bravo! Where we all have the same opportunities. Because after this long day, without a single drop of blood shed, we have overthrown this dictatorship simply by saying, loud and clear, NO! Therefore... long live Chile! Chile Happiness is coming! Did you see that? Up there! Thank you. We are happy. Chile wins. It's a triumph, a personal triumph that represents a choice, I would say... We don't have to impose our opinions. People are taking to the streets to celebrate the NO vote winning over 54% of the total vote. Thousands of people are there. Who doesn't jump for joy? Pinochet! I'm going to leave you with Ren. He will present the piece. Ren is one of the main creators of the successful NO campaign. Thank you, Lucho. Well... First of all, I'd like to say that what you're about to see fits with the current social context. We believe the country is ready for communication like this. Absolutely. Let's be honest: Today, Chile is thinking about its future. Alright? Shall we? Santa Maria tower's heliport welcomed 10 women in formal gowns and 5 men who admired their beauty. Suddenly, the soap opera's hero, Estban Greve, played by Osvaldo Silva, appeared in a helicopter offering a bunch of flowers to these Beautiful and Bold women. These James Bond-style images will be used to promote the state channel's new soap opera. My name is Kiki Blanche. I have 5 children, I own a hair salon, and I was a dancer at the Bim Bam Boum.
