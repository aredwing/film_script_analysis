Our Titchie said. [ Bell Tolling ] [ Men's Chamber Chorus ] No star is o'er the lake Its pale watch keeping The moon is half awake Through gray mist creeping The last red leaves fall 'Round the porch of roses The clock has ceased to sound The long day closes Sit by the silent hearth In calm endeavor To count the sounds of mirth Now dumb forever Heed not how hope believes And fate disposes Shadow is 'round the eaves The long day closes The lighted windows The lighted windows dim Are fading slowly The fire that was so trim Now quivers lowly Quivers lowly Go to the dreamless bed Where grief reposes Thy book of toil is read The long day closes Go to the dreamless bed Where grief reposes Thy book of toil is read Go to the dreamless bed The dreamless bed The long day Closes
